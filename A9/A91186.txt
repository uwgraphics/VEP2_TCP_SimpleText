An Exact CHRONOLOGICAL HISTORY AND FULL DISPLAY OF POPES Intolerable
Usurpations Upon the ancient just Rights, Liberties, of the Kings, Kingdoms,
Clergy, Nobility, Commons of ENGLAND and IRELAND.
THE design of this Chronological History and Display, being principally to
remonstrate to the world, by irrefragable Testimonies and Records, the manifold
unsufferable Usurpations of the Bishops and See of Rome, from time to time,
upon the ancient indubitable just Rights and Liberties of the Kings, Churches,
Nobles, Commons of England and Ireland, whiles they continued under their
Foreign Jurisdiction: More especially by Excom^unications, Interdicts,
absolving Subjects from their Oaths of Allegia^ce, raising Rebellions,
dethroning our Kings, enforcing them to resign their Crowns, to become their
sworn Vassals, Tributaries; exempting Bishops, Clerks from their Homage,
Judicatures; collating Bishoprics, Monasteries, Ecclesiastical Dignities,
Benefices, by Provisions to Aliens, or others; translating, swearing Bishops,
Abbots, to them and their Papal See; vacating due Elections at their pleasures;
Appeals to Rome, Dispensations, Tenths, Procurations, First Fruits, Bribes,
Symony, Crossadoes; varieties of Extortions, Oppressions, by their Legates and
other Instruments: To discover their originals, progress, growth, revivals,
suppressions, with the manifold memorable Complains, Letters, Oppositions,
Writs, Prohibitions, Declarations against them, both in and out of Parliament;
and the frequent Treacheries, Usurpations, of our Popish Prelates, Spiritual
Courts, Officers, upon our Kings just Rights, Prerogatives, Regalities, Courts,
Subjects Liberties, (to the extraordinary d^^ger, mischief of the Crown, Realm,
Church, Christian Religion, and peoples grievance.) And what Sovereign
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction our Kings, as Gods Vicars, have exercised, from
King Lucius his Conversion, Anno 183. till the total extirpation of the Popes
usurped Authority, by King Henry the 8. and Edward the 6. by Histories, and
memorable Records in the Tower and Rolls, for the most part unknown to our
greatest Clerks, Antiquaries, worthy public view; yea adding much light to our
Ecclesiastical and Political Histories, (very defective in these Transactions
of grand Importance:) I apprehended it absolutely necessary, by way of
Introduction (like a Mat. 7. 24, 25. Luke 8. 4^.
Wise Builder) to lay a deep, sure Foundation, whereon to bottom this Weighty
Structure, that so if any Floods shall hereafter come, or Winds blow, and beat
upon it from Rome, or other Quarters, they may not be able to shake, or
overturn it, because it is founded upon a Rock.

To this end I shall (by Gods assistance) in one entire Book, Chronologically
and Historically remonstrate, and (where necessity requires) Polemically
examine, discuss the Original of Sovereign Jurisdiction; in what Persons God
himself has settled the Primitive Right and Exercise thereof, as well over the
Churches Militant as Civil State, from Adams Creation till Christ's Ascension,
and from thence till this present age: And irrefragably demonstrate, by
Scripture, Heathen Philosophers, Fathers, Councils, Ecclesiastical Histories,
Imperial Laws, Edicts, Popes own Epistles, Decretals, Bulls, Archbishops,
Bishops, Popish Divines, Schoolmen, Canonists, Protestant Writers,
Testimonies, and Presidents, in all ages, That the Supreme Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction, (in governing, protecting, reforming the Church, and people of
God; maintaining, propagating the Orthodox Christian Faith, the true public
worship of God; suppressing all Heresies, Errors, Blasphemies, Idolatries,
Schisms, sins, against both Tables, in all Persons, as well Ecclesiastical as
Temporal; taking care of the souls, and salvation of men) is originally vested
by God himself, in Kings, Emperors, or Sovereign Princes, as Gods Vicegerents,
and Christ's Vicars upon Earth, as the principal part of their Royal Authority,
Office, Trust; not in Highpriests, Priests, Apostles, Popes, Patriarchs,
Archbishops, Bishops, or any other Ecclesiastical persons whatsoever; who are
all Subjects to, and subordinate Ministers under them, in the Churches
Militant, within their respective Empires, Kingdoms, Dominions, as all
inferior Civil Magistrates, Officers of Justice, are in their Civil States,
Kingdoms, Courts: And that the received Distinction of Gratian Distinct 10, 96.

two supreme Jurisdictions, Powers, specifically different from, and
independent on each other in their very essence, nature, by Divine Institution,
and (at least ever since our Saviors Ascension) immediately vested in two
distinct callings, professions of men: to wit, the Sovereign Civil Jurisdiction
in and over all secular persons, affairs, in Emperors, Kings, and Temporal
Powers alone; the Supreme Ecclesiastical or Spiritual Jurisdiction in and over
all Churches Militant, Bishops, Priests, Church Members, Divine and
Ecclesiastical affairs, only in Popes, or Patriarchs, not Emperors, Kings,
Secular Princes, States: is but a mere Popish Imposture, Forgery, Fancy,
Stratagem, to cheat, rob, deprive all Christian Emperors, Kings, Princes, of
the richest Pearl, Jewel, chiefest Branch and Flower of their Diadems, to
exempt the Clergy from their Jurisdictions under this pretext, and to subject
both their Persons, Crowns, Kingdoms, Subjects, to the Antichristian
Usurpations, Tyrannies, Exorbitances, Oppressions of Ambitious Popes, Prelates,
Priests, as Ecclesiastical Histories evidence, ever since this Heresy of two
distinct Sovereign Authorities, delegated by Divine Institution to two several
Functions, was first broached in the Christian Church: being the same in
substance with that of Duo Principia, (condemned by Popes themselves, and the
greatest Alvarus Pelagius de Planctu Ecclesiae l. 1. Artic. 13, 37. Thomas

Tertullian thus long since argued: Quid erit unicum and singular, nisi cui
nihil adaequabitur? Quid principale, nisi quod super omnia, nisi quod ante
omnia, and in quo omnia? Haec Deus solus habendo est, and solus habendo, Deus
est. Si and alius habuerit, tot jam erunt Dii, quot habuerint quae Dei sunt.
Quod summum sit, Deus est: summum autem non erit, nisi quod unicum fuerit.
Unicum autem esse non poterit, cui aliquid adaequabitur. Veritas autem sic unum
Deum exigit defendendo, ut solius sit quicquid ipsius est. Ita enim ipsius
erit, si fuerit solius: Et ex hoc alius Deus non possit admitti, dum nemini
licet habere de Deo aliquid. Ergo, inquis, nec nos habemus Dei aliquid. Imo,
habemus, and habebimus; sed ab ipso, non a nobis. Nam and Dii erimus, si and
meruerimus illi esse de quibus praedicavit, Ego dixi, vos Dii estis: and stetit
Deus in Ecclesia Deorum: sed ex gratia ipsius, non ex nostra proprietate, quia
ipse est solus, qui Deos faciat. I may most aptly apply it to Emperors, Kings,
who are Earthly Gods, made such by God in their own Kingdoms, as his Viceroys.
The Sovereign Power, Jurisdiction, over all persons, Churches, causes, as well
Civil as Ecclesiastical, within their respective Realms, must be but one in^ire
indivisible Sovereign Authority, incommunicable unto any other subject or
person whatsoever, but by subordinate derivation and delegation by, from, or
under them; else they should presently cease to be Earthly Gods, had Popes or
Bishops a distinct Supreme Ecclesiastical Power within their Realms, coequal
with, underived from, or independent on them. Whence De Quaestionibus Novi and
Veteris Testamenti, qu. 210.
St. Augustine thus resolves: Sicut terreni Imperatoris auctoritas currit per
omnes, ut in omnibus ejus sit reverentia. Ita Deus instituit, ut ab ipso Rege
Dei auctoritas incipint, et currat per cunctos. Quamvis frequenter mundus hoc
non intelligit, and alii se subjiciat in potestate positus quam debet, tamen
institutio est, ut unus sit qui timeatur. Ubi ergo haec institutio non est, ibi
Cathedra pestilentiae reperitur: (as it is at Rome.) Nusquam enim unius Dei
auctoritas abjicitur, nisi apud eos qui multorum Deorum praedicant metum. From
hence our Doctrinalio Fidei, Tom. 1. Artic. 3. c. 78. sect. 3. f 391.
Thomas Waldensis thus concludes: Ecce ab ipso Rege incipit auctoritas, and
currit per cunctos executores justitiae; and hoc instituit Deus: non ergo
instituit Deus, ut inciperet a Summo Sacerdote, and sola executio potestatis
manaret in Principem. See Tertullian Apolog. c. 30, 31. Here p. 52.
Ecce, inde est Imperator, unde and homo antequam Imperator: and unde homo
antequam Imperator, nisi a Deo? Quamvis a Deo per Sacerdote Christianus homo,
tamen nec homo, nec Christianus homo, nisi a Deo; Ita nec Imperator, nec
Christianus Imperator, nisi a Deo, quamvis per Pontificem fidelis sit Imperator
a Christo; et inde potestas illi, unde et spiritus; et nunquid spiritus illi a
Pontifice? Tertullianus intendi, Quod non, sed a Deo profecto: ergo non
potestas illi a Sacerdotio provenit, a cujus dono animam non accepit.
Potestatis Regiae primum initium in ipso Rege a Deo, et ab ipsius auctoritate
manat in subditas potestates; as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, as I shall here
demonstrate, against all Papal or Pontifical pretenses to the contrary.

For methods sake I shall digest the sum of my First Book into these 5.
Propositions.

1. That from Adams creation, till the Law given by God to Moses, (and by him
unto the Israelites, his peculiar people) the Supreme Paternal, Regal,
Magistratical, with that now styled Spiritual, Pontifical, Ecclesiastical
Authority or Jurisdiction, both in and over the Family, State, Church Militant,
was by Divine and Natural Right vested, united in one person, not many; to wit,
First in Adam himself, but after his decease in the Firstborn, (unless
disinherited by God for sin) or in the Patriarch, or Master of the Family,
Tribe, who was both King and Priest, having the Priesthood annexed to his
Paternal or Regal Office, not these to his Priestship.

2ly. That God, after the Israelites deliverance from the Egyptian bondage,
when he first new-modelled them into a Commonwealth, (and afterward into a
Kingdom) settled both their State and Church Government, dividing the Priesthood
from the Supreme Civil Magistracy, Kingship, vesting the one in Moses, Josuah,
David, Solomon, and their Royal Successors; the other in Aaron, his Sons, and
Tribe of Levi; left the Sovereign Ecclesiastical Power, Jurisdiction over all
persons, causes, still annexed to the Kingly or Supreme Magistratical Office,
and residing in the King, or chief Civil Officer as before, transferring to
Priests only the Ministerial Priestly Offices, not the Sovereign Spiritual
Jurisdiction, the same in kind with, a real part of, and various dispensation
only from the Civil Supremacy.

3ly. That the Supreme Government of the Church Militant, after Christ's
Incarnation, under the Gospel, was vested in Jesus Christ himself, God and Man,
only as he is the King, not Priest or Prophet of the Church, his Priestly and
Prophetical Offices being united to his Kingly, as the first, highest in
dignity and order, not his Regal to his Pontifical or Prophetical Offices.

4ly. That Jesus Christ as Supreme King, Lord, Head of his Kingdom the Church,
whilst on Earth, never claimed, nor exercised any Temporal Regal Jurisdiction,
or Magistratical Authority over any of his Subjects, much less over Emperors,
Kings, Kingdoms, Nations, or Sovereign Civil Powers, nor ever deprived any of
them of their Crowns, nor absolved their Subjects from their Allegiance, nor
cast down, pulled, or rooted up their Kingdoms, nor gave them to whomsoever he
pleased: Neither did he either before, at, or after his Passion, Resurrection,
or Ascension, derive any such Superlative Power to St. Peter, as his sole
universal Vicar or Viceroy, nor to any other Apostle, Bishop, Priest, or Pope
whatsoever: Nor yet delegate to them his supreme Spiritual Jurisdiction over
his Kingdom in this world, the Church Militant, and all the Members of it: but
only the Ministerial part of his Prophetical Office, (his Heb. 7. 15. to the
end. c. 8. 1. c. 9. 11, 12, 24, 25, 26, 28. c. 10. 11, to 24.
High Priesthood being personal, untransferrable, incommunicable to any other)
to wit, preaching the Gospel publicly to all Nations, administering the
Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords Supper, according to his Institution and
Command, feeding his sheep with the sincere milk of his Word, teaching them (as
his Apostles, Ministers, Servants) to obey whatsoever he has commanded them;
beseeching, entreating them as his Ambassadors, in his stead, to be reconciled
unto God: to declare, pronounce them absolved from their sins by God himself,
upon their sincere Repentance, and to denounce damnation against them in case
they do not repent and believe in Christ.

5ly. That Gods principal end and intention in ordaining Kings and supreme
Civil Magistrates in the world, was not the bare external administration of
Justice between man and man, the protection of their Subjects from violence,
oppression; the preservation of them in worldly peace, plenty, prosperity; the
punishment of Malefactors, the rewarding of Well-doers, encouragement of Arts,
Virtue, Trade, Industry, or fighting their Battles in times of War against
Invading Enemies; though Here, p. 191, 192, 193.
considerable parts of their Regal Office, and Sovereign Authority: But the
advancement of Gods honor, worship, service, glory, and spiritual Kingdom,
whose Viceroys they are; the suppression of all Idolatry, Blasphemy, Heresy,
schism, sin, wickedness; the promotion of the eternal salvation, felicity of
their people, and to be 2 Chronicles. 9. 8.
Kings for the Lord their God, by advancing his interest all they can. Upon
which ground (in order to effect these ends) God himself, as well under the
Gospel as Law, has delegated the supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction only to
Kings, and other Sovereign Temporal Potentates, not to Popes, Bishops, Priests,
who are subordinate to them as their Subjects, Ministers, not Copartners with
them in their Sovereign Ecclesiastical Authority in point of Interest, nor yet
in its actual execution, no further then they are pleased by their Laws or
Commissions to delegate it to them, as their Substitutes.

When I have Chronologically evidenced, and fully demonstrated the truth of
these five Conclusions in so many distinct Chapters, in this First Book, I
shall then wholly address my self to my intended Chronological History, in
relation to the Kings and Crown of England, from Lucius our first Christian
King, Anno Dom. 183. till the Popes extirpation, concluding my First Tome
thereof, with the reign of King Henry the third, Anno 1273.

THE FIRST BOOK.
CHAP. I.
Proposition 1. That from Adams Creation, till the Law given by God to Moses,
and by him unto the Israelites, (his peculiar people) the Supreme Paternal,
Regal, Magistratical, together with that now styled Spiritual, Pontifical,
Ecclesiastical Authority or Jurisdiction, both in and over the Family, State,
Church Militant, was by Divine and Natural Right vested, united in one person,
not diverse; to wit, First in Adam himself, but after his decease in the
Firstborn, (unless disinherited by God for some crime or cause) or in the
Patriarch, or Master of the Family, Tribe, who was both King and Priest, having
the Priesthood annexed to his Paternal or Regal Office, not these to his
Priestship.
O evidence the truth of this Proposition, so far as the light of Scripture or
Nature in the first remote obscure age of the world have revealed it, for the
Readers satisfaction, I find it generally acknowledged by all or most See
Bishop Carlton of Jurisdiction Regal, Episcopal, Papal, chapter 2. Alvarus Pelagius
de Planctu Ecclesiae l. 1. Artic. 13, 36, 52, 52, 68.
Divines, and Christian Authors, who have written of the Church, or the
Original of Republikes, Jurisdictions, or Chronologies.

1. That as God (the Ps. 62. 11. Mat. 6. 13. Rom 13. 1, 2.
Original of all power) at the very Creation gave Genesis 1. 26, 27, 28, c. 2 19,

Adam a Sovereign Dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the foul of the
air, and over all the earth, the cattle and every creeping thing therein, to
which he gave their several names, (as a badge of his Sovereignty over them) by
Gods own direction; So he likewise ordained him as well after, as before his
fall, to be both a Dr. Field of the Church, b. 5. chapter 1. Jacobus Bouldo^, Ordo
Ecclesiae a Mundi principio usque ad Legem.
King and Priest over the little world, his family, and posterity issuing from
him during his life, not only to govern and correct them when they
transgressed, but, to offer sacrifices, prayers to God for, and instruct them
in his Worship, Laws, fear. Hence Annals.
Cedren makes Adam, the first KING and Governor, and that with reason enough,
(as Titles of Honor, b. 1. chapter 1. p. 4.
Mr. Seldom notes, because he governed and commanded all mankind as long as he
lived, who by the Law of Nature and Fifth Commandment, are enjoined Exodus 20*

To honor and obey their Father in the flesh, and he not only obliged to
provide for, protect, defend and correct, as a Father; but likewise to *
instruct and educate them in the fear and admonition of the Lord, as a Priest:
Now Adam being a King and Lord not only over all Creatures, but Gen 3. 16. 1 Timothy 2. 12, 13 1 Pet. 3. 5, 6. Ephesians. 5. 22, 23, 24. Col. 3. 18.

Eve his wife, before he was a Father, and over his Posterity (by his Paternal
right) before they were capable of instruction; And the Title of King, being
always prefixed before that of Priest, as most honorable and first in order,
when ever mentioned, and meeting together in one person, as in Psalm. 110. 1, 2,
4.

Others, who were both Kings and Priests, and the High Priests always
inferior, subordinate to the Chief Civil Governors and Kings of Judah, and in
Heathen Nations. It thence most clearly follows, that the Priesthood and
Spiritual Jurisdiction in Adam was at first united and subordinate to his
Kingly, Sovereign Magistratical Office and Authority, and so continued whiles
residing in one person; from the Creation till the Law given in mount Sin^i.

2ly. That Cain, Adams firstborn, having forfeited his birthright and life too
by the murder of his Brother Abel, and thereby Genesis 4. 11. 14.
Seth becoming his firstborn, when Adam deceased, his Kingship and Priesthood
descended first to Seth, and after him successively to the Patriarchs, who were

Princes and Chief Governers of their Families, Tribes to rule, protect and
correct them when they offended, but likewise their Priests, to erect Altars
and Houses to God for his public worship, to offer Sacrifices, prayers, vows
to God for them, to bless them in his Name, to teach them his Laws, Fear, and
the Covenants made by God to them and their seed, and commanded them to put
away their strange gods and idols, (as Jacob did.) All which is evident by the
examples of Noah, Genesis 8. 20, 21. c. 9. 25, 26, 27. Abraham, Genesis 12. 7. c. 13.
4, 18. c. 17. 1, 2, 8, etc. 23, to 27. c. 18. 19, 23, etc. c. 20. 7. 17. c. 21.

3ly. Upon this account, after the Law given and Priesthood vested in Aaron and
the Tribe of Levi, the Exodus 13. 13. c. 22. 29. c. 34. 20. Numb. 3. 12, 13. 42,
to 51. c. 8. 16, 17, 18.
firstborn (though they lost this privilege of exercising the Priests Office
as before, yet they were still the Lords) to redeem themselves with an oblation
of five shekels by the poll, for their exemption from the Priesthood; because
God had taken the Levites from among the Israelites, instead of all the
firstborn among the children of Israel, which redemption was given to Aaron and
his Sons, who officiated in their steads.

4ly. That upon this original right, privilege of Primogeniture, Christ
himself as Ps. 89. 27.
Gods firstborn, was not only made Higher then the Kings of the Earth, 1 Timothy
6. 15. Rev. 17. 14. c. 19. 16.
King of Kings, Lord of Lords; but likewise Col. 1. 15. to 20.
Head over all the Church, that in all things he might have the Preeminence.
And had (like the Firstborn before the Law) the Supreme Priestly Office and
Power, united to his Kingly; Yea in some sense Christ has fully restored this
ancient Right to all who are spiritually Gods Heb. 12. 23
Firstborn, and the Romans 16. 7. Jam. 1. 18. Rev. 14. 4.
First Fruits of his Creatures, as the Gospel styles them, having the Romans 8.

he has MADE KINGS AND PRIESTS UNTO GOD HIS FATHER, as the Marginal Texts
resolve.

5ly. That the very Gentiles and Pagan Nations by the Law and Light of Nature,
vested the Supreme Ecclesiastical Authority, and often times the Priesthood it
self in their Kings, and chief Temporal Magistrates, who erected, consecrated
Temples, Altars, Groves, constituted by their particular Laws the several
Orders, Offices of Priests; the Number, Worship, Services of their Gods, and
the Sacrifices, Ceremonies and whole manner of their Worship. To instance in
some particulars.

Godwins Roman Antiq. l. 2. Sect 1. etc. 9. and (...) Moses and (...), l. 1. c.
4.
Fanus the antientest of the Kings in Italy, was the first who brought in
thither the form of Religion; He cousecrated Groves, erected Temples, from whom
they were called Fana; ordained Priests and Sacrifices. Evander his next
Successor, introduced many other Ceremonies in the Worship of the Gods. Anius,
as (...) l. 3. (...) Roman Ant^q. l. 2. c. 9.
Virgil relates, was at once, REX IDEM HOMINUM, PHAEBIQUE SACERDOS. After Rome
was built, Romulus the first King thereof, and Numa Pompilius who succeeded
him, made several Laws concerning the whole Worship, Service, Holy Days,
Ceremonies of their Gods, instituted their distinct Orders of Priests; as
highest Priest, chief Priests, and lesser Priests, Vestals, Salii;
distinguishing and limiting all their respective Offices, Jurisdictions,
habits, by special Laws, recorded by Antiq. Rom l. 3. Sect. 3, 8,
Dionysius Halicarnasseus, In Romu^^s, and Nama.
Plutarch, Romans Hist. l. 12.
Livy, and Paulus Manut^us Anttiq. l. 1.
others: Yea Romans Ant. l. 2. c. 9.
Godwin observes, That it was A CUSTOM among the Graecians, as likewise
afterward among the Romans, THAT THEIR KINGS SHOULD PERFORM AS WELL THE
CEREMONIES AND HOLY RITES OF RELIGION, as Civil businesses, being BOTH KINGS
AND PRIESTS, till See Dionys. Ha^^^n. Ant. Romans l. 2. and Plutarchi Numa.
Numa perceiving that foreign wars did often occasion the Kings absence,
whereby the service of the Gods was neglected, thereupon ordained several
Orders of Priests, (as their Vicars generals or Curates) to discharge their
priestly function: Yet after this institution their Consuls, Censors, and some
of their Pagan Emperors, as Cor. Tacit. Annal. l. 3. ^p. (...), Defense of the
Apol. part 6. c. 11. d^vis. 4, 5. p. 711.
Tiberius, Ve^^atian, Trajan, were created PONTIFEX MAXIMUS, their Highest
Priest, (or POPE) and managed the Supreme Civil and Pontifical affairs, and
that by election of the Senate, and the people only, without the Priests; as
Genesis dierum l. 2. c. 8.
Alexander ab Alexandro, and the Roman Histories record. I shall close this
Chapter with that of the Roman Historian, J^stinus ^^^toriae, lib. 1.
PRINCIPIO RERUM GENTIUMque IMPERIUM PENES REGES ERAT, populus nullis legibus
tenebatur, arbitria Principum pro legibus erant; and that as well in all
Sacred, Religious, as Civil and Military affairs.

BOOK I. CHAP. II.
2. My Second Proposition is, That God, after the Israelites deliverance from
the Egyptian bondage, when he first new modelled them into a Commonwealth, and
afterward into a Kingdom; settled their State and Church government, and
divided the Priesthood from the Supreme Civil Magistracy and Kingship, vesting
the one in Moses, Josuah, David, Solomon, and their Royal Successors, the other
in Aaron, his Sons, and the Tribe of Levi, did even then leave the Sovereign
Ecclesiastical Power and Jurisdiction over all persons and causes, still
annexed to, and residing in the Supreme Civil Magistratical Office and
Officers, transferring only the Ministerial Priestly Offices to the Priests,
not the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction. being not different in kind from, but the
very same with the Civil, varyed only by the Object, not Subject of it.
THis I shall evidence as clear as the noonday Sun.

1. By Ten memorable particulars recorded in Sacred History, concerning Moses,
(the first Supreme Temporal Governor in the Israelites Commonwealth,)
demonstrating his Sovereign Jurisdiction in all Sacred, Religious, Church
affairs.

1. God himself by the Ministry of Exodus 13
Moses (not Aaron) instituted, described, celebrated the feast and Sacrament of
the Passover, and sanctified all the firstborn of the children of Israel unto
God, and was to Aaron INSTEAD OF GOD, Exodus 4. 16.

2ly. Exodus 15. ^^ etc. Rev. 15. 3^
Moses, not Aaron, penned and prescribed that memorable Song of Praise which
all the Israelites sang unto the Lord, immediately after their deliverance out
of Egypt, and drowning of the Egyptians ^n the Red Sea.

3dly. Exodus 16. John 6. 31, 3^ 33, etc. 1 Cor 10. 3.
Moses, not Aaron, gave them instructions concerning the gathering, and for
reserving of an Omer of Manna to be kept before the Lord, as a Type of Christ,
the true Manna.

4ly. God himself immediately Exodus c. 19. to 21. 24. Mat. 4. and 5. John 1.
17. c. 7. 19. Josh. 8. 31. 35.
appeared unto Moses in Mount Sinai, and by his Mouth and Ministry alone (not
Aarons) delivered the first Covenant, and the Moral, Ceremonial and Judicial
Law unto his people Israel, the only rule of their Worship, Obedience,
Government Sacred and Civil.

5ly. That when Exodus c. 14. to 21. c. 31. 18. c. 12. 15, 16. Deuteronomy. c. 4. and
5. c. 9, 10. Heb. 9. 19.
Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu and seventy of the Elders were afterward called up
into Mount Sinai by God; Moses alone was called to come near to God, and Aaron
left behind; That Moses alone wrote all the words of the Lord, built an Altar
for the 12 Tribes of Israel, read the Book of the Covenant to them, sprinkled
the blood of the Covenant both on the Altar, Book, and all the people; received
the Tables of stone and Law written therein by God himself; and the pattern of
the Tabernacle, Mercy-seat, Altar, and all the furniture and utensils thereof,
the garments of Aaron and the Priests, the manner and ceremonies of their
respective Consecrations, and all the oblations, sacrifices, and parts of Gods
worship to be therein performed both by the Priests and people, from God. Hence
it is specially recorded both in the Old Testament and New, That these precepts
concerning the Sanctuary of God, Exodus 25. 3. 40. Numb. 8. 4. Hebr. 8. 5. Acts
7. 44.
Let them make me a Sanctuary that I may dwell amongst them, according to all
that I show thee, after the pattern of the Tabernacle, and the pattern of the
instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it: And Exodus 31, to cap. 40.
look that thou make them after the pattern which was showed thee in the Mount;
were given only to Moses, the Chief Temporal Magistrate; (Not to Aaron nor the
Priests or Levites;) who alone directed all things to be made accordingly. And
when all the work of the Tabernacle with the Curtains and the Priests Garments
were finished by the Workmen, Exodus 39, 42, 43.
Moses, not Aaron, survayed and looked upon all the work, and behold they had
done it as the Lord commanded, even so had they done it, and Moses (not Aaron)
blessed them.

6ly. After all the work was thus finished, Exodus 40. 1. to 36.
Moses, not Aaron, was particularly commanded to rear up the Tabernacle, with
all its furniture, and to anoint and consecrate them unto God.

7ly. Which is most observable, Aaron and his Sons did not anoint Moses to be
the Supreme Civil Magistrate; but on the contrary, God by Moses not only
prescribed all the spiritual Offices, duties, qualifications, vestments, Levit.
21. 7, etc.
wives, marriages, maintenance, and appurtenances belonging to Aaron and his
sons, but also specially designed and commanded Moses, to anoint and consecrate
them to their Priesthood, recorded in these words, Exodus 40. 12, to 17. And the
Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, THOU shall bring Aaron and his sons to the
door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and wash them with water; and THOU
shall put upon Aaron the holy Garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him, that
he may Minister unto me in the Priests Office: And Thou shall bring his Sons
and cloth them with coats, and Thou shall anoint them, as Thou did their
Father, that they may Minister unto me in the Priests Office: For their
anointing shall surely be an everlasting Priesthood throughout their
generations: Thus did Moses according to all that the Lord commanded him, so
did he. So Moses finished the Work, without Aarons, or his Sons assistance.
Never did Aaron nor his Sons consecrate or anoint any part of the Tabernacle,
Ark, or utensils thereof, their own garments, ointment, nor any one High Priest
or Levite of their Tribe, but See Number: 20: 25: to 29.
Moses the Supreme Temporal Magistrate only, by Gods own special command,
whose consecration alone for ever sanctified all their Successors to the High
Priests and Priests respective offices: which I desire all Popes, and Romish
Prelates, (who now appropriate all consecrations whatsoever of persons or
things, to themselves alone by a pretended Divine right, excluding the Civil
Magistrate) seriously to consider, and from thence Aventinus Annal: Boiar: l.
6: p: 506: A^va^us (...) De P^anctu Eccles: l. 1: art: 13:
argue a superiority over Kings, Emperors as well as Priests, and exact
Canonical obedience from them.

8ly. When Exodus 32. throughout, Ps. 106. 19, 20. 1 Cor. 10. 7. Acts 7. 40.
Aaron the High Priest during Moses his absence in the Mount, had at the
peoples request, made, erected a golden calf, who committed idolatry with it;
Moses calls him to a strict account for it, to whom he made an excuse, with
this memorable preface, Let not the anger of MY LORD wax hot; which style he
likewise gave him Nu. 12 11.) Yea Moses, not he, Pronounced the Judgment and
punishment upon the people for this Sin of Idolatry, as likewise Number. 15. 32,
to 37.
on him that gathered sticks on the Sabbath day, the manner of whose punishment
he inquired (not Aaron) and received from God.

9ly. When the Tables of stone formerly broken were renewed, redelivered by God
to the people, it was always done (even after Aarons consecration) by the
hand, mouth, ministry of See the whole Book of Deuteronomy. especially c. 4, and 5.
and cap. 31. to 34 ^osnua 1. 17. c. 8. 31. 33.
Moses, who with his own mouth always spoke and delivered Gods Laws, Messages
to all the Congregation, Elders, people, during all his Government, and gave
them a special charge of things future, and a blessing at his death.

10thly. God made choice of Moses (a Layman and Civil Magistrate) to be the
fir^^ p^^man and Register of all his sacred Laws, and first Five Books of holy
Scripture, not Aaron, or any other Priest; And to show that Kings and Temporal
Magistrates were the principal keepers of both Tables, God particularly
enjoined when the Israelites came into the Land of Canaan, and had set a King
over them, Deuteronomy. 17. 15, 17, 18, 19, 20.
that the King when he sat upon the Throne of his Kingdom, shall write him a
Copy of this Law in a Book out of that which is before the Priests the Levites;
that it may be well with him; and he shall read therein all the days of his
life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, and to keep all the words of
this Law, and these Statutes to ^o them* That his heart be not lifted up above
his brethren; and that he turn not aside from the Commandment, to the right
hand or to the left, to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom,
he and his children in the midst of Israel.

All which particulars laid together, relating to and acted by the very first
Supreme Civil Magistrate that God himself set up over his own peculiar people,
Church, when he first instituted, modelled both their Magistrates and Priests,
with their distinct Offices and powers, will infallibly clear the Superior
Jurisdiction of the Supreme Civil Magistrate in and over all Ecclesiastical
persons and causes, by Gods own institution* and that the Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction is united to the Temporal.

The reason why God reserved the Supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction to Moses,
the Chief Civil Magistrate, and afterward to Kings, when he transferred the
Priesthood to Aaron and his Sons, and severed it from the Kingship, was,
because it would be inconsistent with Monarchy, and the Peace, Unity of the
Republike, Kingdom, Church, to erect two distinct Supreme Powers independent
on, unsubordinate to each other in one and the same Body Politic, Nation,
Kingdom united under one Supreme Civil Head, and a Cause of perpetual Wars,
Schisms, Contentions between these different powers, by reason of men's Natural
ambition, and desire to enlarge their Juriisdictions to the prejudice of each
other. This we find experimentally verified in the Israelites themselves
immediately upon their division into two independent kings, kingdoms, of equal
power unsubordinate to each other, which produced not only perpetual Wars
between them all their days in their Realms, as sacred Story 1 Kings 14. 30.
c. 15. 9, 7. 16. 31.
often records, but a more sad division in their Religion, Worship, Church; 1
Kings 12. 26. to the end. c. 1^. 33, 34. c. 15. 3. 2 Ki^gs 10. 31. cap. 17. 2.
to 25.
Jeroboam erecting two Calves and a new idolatrous worship, with suitable
Priests, to promote it, and a new place of worship contrary to that prescribed
by God himself, to keep his Subjects from Gods true worship at Jerusalem, and
returning to their allegiance and obedience to their rightful Kings of the
seed of David; which all his Successors persevered in till their final
captivity and utter desolation for their idolatry. And it is infallibly
evidenced by the manifold sad Divisions, Schisms, Wars, Rebellions in most
Christian Empires, kingdoms, ever since the ambitious Popes of Rome and other
Prelates, have claimed by a pretended divine independent right, and usurped to
themselves the Supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over all Persons, Causes,
inseparably united by God himself to the Crowns of Christian Emperonrs and
Kings. As God therefore out of his infinite Wisdom, at the very Creation,
constituted but one natural head over every natural body of Men, Beasts, Fowls,
Fishes, and creeping living creatures, though they consisted of two different
substances, Soul and Body, not two distinct heads, the one corporal, the other
spiritual, to govern each body; because two Supreme head^ would have destroyed
the unity, harmony, operations of these Creatures in their respective orbs;
and made 1 Cor. 12, 13. to 26.
a Schism in their bodies; So he at first united the Supreme Spiritual and
Temporal Jurisdiction over Men at the Creation in one person, Adam, the first
sole Monarch of the World; And afterward, when his Church and people
multiplied into such a vast dispersed multitude, that one person could not
possibly execute or discharge the Kingly and Priestly Offices (as at first he
conveniently might, did whiles all united in one Tribe and Family) so that
there was an absolute necessity to divide them into several Hands, Tribes; God
did even then reserve the Supreme Ecclesiastical Government and Jurisdiction,
as absolutely necessary for, inseparable from the Supreme Civil Head and
Governor of his people, to prevent Schisms, Confusions, and preserve Unity,
Tranquillity both in Church and State; not transferr it from Moses to Aaron;
the Church with all its Officers, Members, being included in and branches of
the Kingdom, Republike, not divided from it as a distinct independent spiritual
corporation: Therefore still to remain under the sole Government and protection
of the Supreme Politic Head. Ezech. 37. 26. to 28.
This is most clearly and significantly expressed by Ezechiels uniting the two
divided sticks into one rod in one hand, typifying the uniting of the two
divided Kingdoms of Israel and Judah, into one Kingdom, Church, PEOPLE, under
one King and Shepherd Jesus Christ, and making them all but ONE, in their
Government and true Worship of God according to his Statutes.

Hence it is most apparent, that the Civil and Ecclesiastical Powers,
Authorities or Jurisdictions are not thus denominated, because they are vested
in different persons hands, or flow from various fountains, or distinct in
their natures, (as the Gratian Distinct. 96. and qu. 63.
Pontificians and others generally assert, and mistake) but merely because they
are exercised upon or about different things or objects; the persons wherein
they originally and supreamly reside and from whence they flow, and the very
Powers, Authorities, Jurisdictions themselves in their nature, being but one
and the same, only the objects, matters, in, upon, or about which they are
exercised, various and distinct, from whence they have these different
Epithites. To evidence this truth past all contradiction, being the surest
Oracle to resolve all future Controversies concerning these Jurisdictions, yea
keenest axe to cut off that ambitious usurping Antichristian Power of Roman
Pontifs, which 2 These. 2. 4.
opposes, exalts it self above all that is called God, and trampleth under
feet both the Crowns, Scepters of all Christian Kings; I shall first clear and
confirm it by Gods own distribution of various Gifts and powers to the Members
of his mystical body the Church, and members, faculties of the bodies, souls of
men by one and the self-same spirit, thus emphatically expressed, 1 Cor. 12 4,
to 12. Now there are diversities of Gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are
differences of administrations. but the same Lord; and there are diversities of
operations, but it is the same God which works all in all: For to one is
given by the Spirit the word of Wisdom; to another the word of Knowledge by the
same Spirit; to another Faith by the same Spirit; to another the Gifts of
Healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of Miracles; to another
Prophecy; to another Discerning of spirits; to another diverse kinds of tongues;
to another the interpretation of tongues; But all these works that one and
the self-same spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will, Compared with
v. 18. 25. God has set the members every one of them in the body (natural) See
1 Cor. 15. 37, 38.
AS IT PLEASES HIM, that there should be no Schism in the body, appointing
them all their distinct Offices, places under one head the seat of the soul,
which rules and directs all the other Members in the discharge of all natural,
civil, moral and divine actions, diversified, denominated only by and from
their various objects so styled, not the person, power, head or faculty, by
which they are all performed, being but one and the same. As God Psalm. 97. 2.
Psalm. 9. 59. Psalm. 10. 16.
the great King over all the earth, 22 24. Mat. 6. 13.
whose is the Kingdom and the power, Mum. 1, 2. Col. 1. 16. Prove. 8. 15, 16.
from whom all Kings and Potentates of the Earth derive their Jurisdiction, as
their Ordainer and Orderer, always Soveraignly Dan. 4. 17.
rules in the Kingdoms of men, and gives them to whomsoever he will; he
removes Kings and sets up Kings at his pleasure, Dan. 2. 11. Job. 12. 18.
by his indivisible Supreme authority; And as by one and the self-same power,
spirit, he also distributes varieties of Gifts, Graces, Offices, to the Members
of his Spiritual body the Church, and distinct faculties to one and the same
reasonable Soul in man in which they are united (as vegetation, sense, reason,
memory, will, judgment, affections, etc.) with distinct offices places to every
member in the body natural: without erecting any plurality of Supreme Powers,
parts, principles, heads, souls, in himself or them, from which these
diversities of Gifts and their operations issue: So Kings and Sovereign Powers,
(Gods Vicars and Ministers upon earth) by that one and the same Supreme
Authority vested in them by God for Government of all sorts of Subjects, and
all sacred or civil Corporations under them, whether Pagans or Christians; may
and do exercise all sorts of civil and Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions under them
in person, or by their Delegates and Substitutes; without any real division in
their Sovereign power, continuing still one the same, or erect^ng two distinct
specifical Powers, the one Civil, the other Ecclesiastical in themselves or
others. ^or, as their Sovereign Royal Power when exercised about Martial
affairs, is styled a Military power, and the Courts wherein it is judicia^^y
executed are styled Martial Courts, because the matters, persons in and about
which it is exercised are such. And when employed in matters, Courts of Law and
Justice is called a Civil or Legal Power, and their Courts, Courts of Common or
Civil Law, because the businesses are such; And when versed in Maritine affairs
or causes, is called A Maritime or Admiralty Power, and Admiralty Court: and
when in Civil matters of Equity only, it is then phrased a Chancery or
Equitable Power, and the Court wherein it is acted, a Court of Chancery: So by
the self-same reason when it is employed in or about divine, sacred,
Ecclesiastical things or persons, it is then styled An Ecclesiastical power,
the Laws concerning them, and Courts wherein these Laws, powers are exercised,
the 37 H: 8. c. 17 1 E. 6. c. 2. Cooks Rep:f. 1. to 41.
Kings Ecclesiastical Laws, Therefore they and their Courts, Proc^sse,
Proceedings, should hear only his Images, Arms, Superscriptions, as well as
his Current Money, and all Common Law Courts, 1 E 6: c 2. that all may know and
own them to be the Ki^gs alone, not bishops:
Courts; without making any fraction, division, or distinction in the Supreme
power, which remains still but one and the same, residing entirely in the King
himself alone, though the execution of it be distributed to sundry subordinate
Courts, persons, who are but the Kings mere Ministers, and act (or ought to
act) all in his Name, Right; without claiming any share at all in the Sovereign
Regal power as vested in themselves by this distribution: being thus
distinguished, denominated only by and from the diversity of the respective
objects, which make no more multiplications of nor divisions in the power it
self, then diversities of colors, spec^es in the eyes, or varieties of sounds,
tastes in the ears or palate; make so many distinct faculties in the Eyes,
Ears, Palate; or as many different eyes, ears, pallats, as there are species,
sounds, tastes discerned by them. All which does evidently appear in this
Or^ginal President of Supreme Jurisdiction in Moses, the first Sovereign
Governor over Gods people, when originally made both a Kingdom, and Church by
Gods own institution; wherein the High Priest Aaron and his Sons had no share
at all in the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, though the Priesthood was settled on
them, but Moses enjoyed, exercised it entirely, without any Partition made by
God between him and Aaron, to divide these powers equally between them as
Coheirs.

Marta resolve, That as it is Heretical to hold duo principia, Two Principles
or Authors of the World: So it is Heretical to hold, that there are Two Vicars
of God or Christ upon Earth, the one in Spirituals, the other in ^emorals;
Therefore it is of necessity, that Supreme Temporal and Spiritual Jurisdiction
should be entirely vested in the Pope, not in the Emperor or Kings, who derive
all their power from him; and it is of necessity to believe, that every
creature should be subject to the Pope as well in Temporal as Spiritual things,
to avoid the Heresy of duo principia, Dantes the Florentine who held the
contrary, being coudemned by the Pope for an Heretic after his death. Indeed
their position, That there is but one Supreme Head and Fountain of all
Spiritual and Regal power on Earth in every distinct Kingdom and Church, is an
undubitable truth, as these Pontificians and Popes themselves assert. But that
it was ever vested in the High Priest under the Law, or Popes under the Gospel,
but in Moses, Kings, and other Supreme Magistrates; and that they derive all
their Temporal Authority from Priests, Popes, not they from Kings and Supreme
Civil Governors, is a notorious untruth, as this Original president of Moses
and Aaron, with others following will irrefragably evince.

This I the rather mention, and have more largely insisted on, because some

Whereupon to prop up the Popes tottering Supremacy as founded upon Aarons
Priestood, Pope Anacletus, with others of his Successors, have bottomed the
Popes Sovereign Jurisdiction in Spiritual and Temporal affairs too, upon Moses
and Aaron jointly, affirming Moses to be a Chief Priest as well as Aaron, from
Psalm. 99. 6. Moses and Aaron among HIS PRIESTS; Whence they infer; That as
Moses and Aaron were the chief among the Priests in the Old Testament: So Peter
was ordained head of the Apostles, and Original of the Apostleship in the New,
and the Pope as his Successor: And as Moses was constituted a God unto Pharaoh,
and judged the people of Israel: So the Pope is the God of the Emperor, the
First Priest, the Vicar of Christ the High Priest, and the Cardinals assisting
him, are Priests of the Levitical kind, by whose assistance he Judges all
Criminal causes, not only Ecclesiastical, but likewise Civil and mixed; Moses as
a Priest being only a Type of the Pope, as were Melchisedec and all those that
were Kings as well as Priests before the Law given; as De Planctu Ecclesiae l.
1. Art: 13. Glossa in Gratian Distinct: 22. 66 De Poenitentia. Distinct: 3.
Alvarus Pelagius and other Pontificians conclude, with very great confidence.

To which I answer, 1. That Moses neither before his flight out of Egypt, nor
during his absence before his return thither, nor whiles he abode there to
deliver the Israelites from their bondage, nor after their deliverance, was
ever made or constituted a Priest, much less an High Priest, by God, (for ought
we read) but only Exodus: 27. 21. cap: 28. throughout. c. 29. 1. c. 40. 12 to 17.
Levit. 9 and 10
Aaron, with his sons and Levites. 2ly. Had Moses been an high Priest as well
as Aaron, as these assert, there had then been two high Priests at once, and so
two Supreme heads of the Church, not one: and so the high Priest could not be a
proper Type of Christ, the Heb. 2. 17. c: 3. 1. c, 4. 8, 4. 15. c. 3. 10. c. 6.
20. c. 7. 16. c. 8. 1. 3. c. 3. 11. c. 9. 22.
sole high Priest and head of his Church, nor of St. Peter, or the Pope, his
pretended Vicar General by divine Right. 3ly. The Scripture is express, that
Aaron only was the chief Priest, not Moses, and that there Exodus 18. 1, etc. c.
40, to 17
neither was nor ought to be any more high Priests but one at a time; Therefore
Moses could be no high Priest. 4ly. Moses in the 99 Psalm, and all other Texts
where he and Aaron are mentioned, is put and named in the first place before
Aaron, and asserted by Levit. 21. 10. Number: 15. 25, 28. Josh: 20. 1. 2 Kings 22.

Bartholomeus Buxiensis, Thierry, and other Glossers, to be greater then Aaron
in two respects, in the very Priesthood it self; Therefore he, not Aaron, was
the chief high Priest: and so all Popes pretenses for their Supremacy drawn
from Aarons high Priesthood, must vanish into smoke; The rather, because we
frequently read in Scripture, that Moses not only COMMANDED AARON, but likewise
stripped him of his garments, and girt them on Eleazer his Son and successor
a little before his death. 5ly. Psalm 99. does not evince Moses to be a chief
Priest as well as Aaron, no more then the rest of the people; as is evident by
the coherence with verse 5, 6. Exodus: 4. 28, 29. c. 5. 1. 4. 20 and above 100.
other Texts.
Exalt ye the Lord our God and worship at his footstool, for he is holy; Moses
and Aaron among his Priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his Name;
these called upon the Name of the Lord and he heard them: this passage relates
to Numb. 25. 6. when Moses and Aaron and all the Congregation were all weeping
and worshipping God together promiscuously intermixed with Phinehas and the
other Priests, Glosia in Gratian did. 22
as also in Joel 2. 16, 17. Numb. 20. 25. to 29.
So as the sole argument hence is this; Moses and Aaron worshipped and called
upon the name of the Lord at the door of the Tabernacle mixed promiscuously
with the other Priests, as Samuel did with the people when they called on Gods
name; Ergo, Moses (and by consequence all the people too) were high Priests as
well as Aaron: So that the Popes absolute Sovereign Monarchy as well in
Temporal as Civil things being thus grounded on Moses his mistaken Priesthood,
must needs fall to the ground, and be for ever exploded upon the premised
considerations; and because his Successor (no high Priest nor Priest at all)
enjoyed, exercised the Sovereign Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction as well as
Temporal in the Israelites Church, and State.

2ly. I shall demonstrate this Propositions truth, by Joshua, who succeeded
Moses in the Supreme Civil Authority, to whom the Israelites not only Josh. 1.
16 c. 4. 14.
promised the self same obedience in all Spiritual as well as civil things,
which they yielded to Moses, but he likewise exercised the same Sovereign
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction as Moses had done, as these Ten instances
irrefragably prove.

1. He Josh 3. 6. to 17. c. 4, 5, etc. 15, to 22.
commanded the people to sanctify themselves to morrow, and commanded, directed
the Priests when to take up, and how to carry and dispose of the Ark of the
Covenant and declared the words to the people which God himself immediately
spoke unto him.

2. He Josh. 5. 5. to 15.
circumcised all the uncircumcised Israelites with sharp knives, and kept the
Passover, formerly omitted, by special directions given to him from God; not
to the Priests.

3. By Gods special direction He commanded the Josh. 6. 1. to 17.
Priests to compass Jericho bearing the Ark round about it, seven days one
after another, which they obeyed, executed without dispute, marching seven
times round about it the last day.

4. He (not the Priests) Ordained Josh. 7.
a public fast, sanctified the people when he discovered Gods wrath against
them for Achans taking of the accursed thing against his command; and examined,
punished with stoning to death, even that, which Popes and Canonists style

built an Altar unto the Lord God of Israel in Mount Ebal according to the Law

Moses; and read all the words of the Law of Moses, the Blessings and the
Curses, before all the congregation of Israel, with their women, little ones,
and strangers conversant among them; there was not a word of all that Moses
commanded which he read not unto them, and that in presence of the Priests and
Levites, who there stood on both sides of the Ark, and bore it.

6ly. He Josh. chapter 9.

10thly. Joshua a little before his death (not the Priests) Joshua 24 1. to 29.
assembled all the Tribes of Israel to Sechem, and there calling all their
Elders, Heads, Judges, Officers, who presenting themselves before God, he
repeated the Histories of Gods great mercies to them from Terah his time till
then, and commanded them to serve the Lord in sincerity and truth, and to put
away all the gods which their Fathers had served, renewed the Covenant between
God and them, set them a Statute and an Ordinance in Sechem, and wrote all the
words thereof in the Book of the Law of God, and set up a stone for a witness
unto them, lest they should deny their God. And penned the History styled Joshua

During all this time of Moses and Joshua's Governments, we find not one
syllable of any Ecclesiastical Supreme Authority, exercised or claimed by the
High Priest, Priests or Levites, severally or jointly, but only by Moses and
Joshua themselves, in all the forecited particulars; Which Popes and Popish
Prelates would repute most strange and uncouth, should Christian Emperors,
Kings, Princes now exercise the like Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, and confine
them only to Preaching, Administration of the Sacraments, reading Mass or
Common Prayers, and those other essential Ministerial duties, which they
delegate for the most part to poor Curates; as they do their pretended
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction and Judicatories to their Vicars Generals,
Chancellors, Officials, Commissaries, and other such party Officers, the more
to fleece the people, and ease themselves from Trouble or Clamors.

3dly. After the death of Joshua, though the High Priest, Priests and Levites
were all settled in their possessions and offices in his life, yet we read of
none of them in all the Book of Judges, when the people of Israel were very
idolatrous, wicked and most needed Ecclesiastical censures to reform them, that
did ever use the least Ecclesiastical Authority over them: Therefore doubtless
they had none vested in them, or else were intollerably negligent, and
blameworthy. And to put it past Dispute, it is no less then four several times
specially recorded in that sacred story, Judge. 17. 6. c. 18. 1. c. 19. 1. c.
21. 25. IN THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NO KING IN ISRAEL Every man did what seemed
good in his own eyes. First, as the chief cause of Judge. 17. 4 5, 6. Judges 18.
1, 14, to 21. 30. 31.
Micah, his making a graven and molten image, and setting them up in the house
of God, and making an Ephod, Teraphim, and consecrating one of his sons, who
became a Priest to his Idols, and after that in Judges 18. 14, to 21. 30, 31.
consecrating a Levite to be his Idols Priest. 2ly. [b] As the occasion of the
Danites plundring and taking away Micahs Idol god, and setting up his graven
Image in the Tribe of Dan, and making Priests unto it all the time that the
house of God was in Shiloh. 3ly. Judge. 19. 8. 1,
Of a Levites taking to him a Concubine, (instead of a lawful Wife) and the
Gibionites ravishing her to death. 4ly. Judge. 21. 16. to the end.
Of the Benjamites forceable taking away of the Virgins, who came up to the
feast of the Lord at Shiloth, and making them their wives against their will,
and that by the Israelites advice and concurrence, contrary to the curse and
oath they had made. All properly spiritual and ecclesiastical Crimes, belonging
rather to Papal and Pontifical, then regal Jurisdiction and Coertion as they
are now reputed; yet all and every of these are recorded to be perpetrated, but
not corrected in the least, because in those days there was no King in Israel;
Therefore questionless, all the supreme, Civil, Ecclesiastical power to
restrain and punish these offenses, was wholly vested in the King; not in the
high Priest, Priests, or Levites, of which they had then store in Israel. And
had this supreme spiritual Authority been in them, these Texts had been very
impertinently inserted, and should rather have run in this Dialect; In those
days there was no high Priests or Priests in Israel, (nor any Ecclesiastical
Court or Judge, therefore) every one did that which was right in his own eyes.

If any object, Object.
that Ely the high Priest judged Israel forty years, Judge. 4. 18. and that
Samuel, next high Priest after him, judged Israel all his days, till he was
old, built an Altar unto the Lord at Ramah; and when he grew old, made his two
sons Judges over the people, Judge. 7. 15, 16, 17. c. 8. 1. to 8. Therefore the
high Priests had then the sovereign Jurisdiction as Priests.

I answer; Answer.
The Argument is most absurd; for by the like Consequence they may argue, Judge.
c. 4. v. 5.
Deborah a woman, the wife of Lapidoth judged Israel; and the Children of
Israel came up to her for Judgment, and she delivered them out of Sisera his
hands, who sorely oppressed them with his Chariots and Army: Ergo, Debora as a
woman had then Sovereign Jurisdiction over them. 2ly. They judged them not as
Priests, but supreme Magistrates. 3ly. It seems the chief Ecclesiastical power
was not in Ely, when he judged Israel, but in the Elders of Israel, by 2 Samuel
4. 3, and 5. 13.
their sending for, and fetching the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of
Shiloh unto them in the Camp, to save them from the enemies, against Ely his
Will; 4ly. He was very remiss and indulgent to, inflicting no civil nor
ecclesiastical punishment upon his sons, though sons of 1 Samuel 2. 12. to 36.
Belial, whose wickedness was great before the Lord, both in lying with the
women that assembled at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation; and
forceably taking away from those that sacrificed to the Lord, the flesh of the
Sacrifices of those that came to offer, how much and when they pleased, without
burning the fat presently, so that they made men abhor the offerings of the
Lord; His Sons presumed thus impudently to abuse the people, because their
father judged Israel, who only gave them a mild Reprehension, when he heard of
their evil reports from all the people: Which miscarriages of his sons in their
Priesthood, and himself in his Judicature, 1 Samuel 2. 27, etc.
sharply reproved by a man of God, were most severely punished of God 1 Samuel 4,
11, to the end.
by their slaughter and untimely deaths, the ruin of their families, and loss
of the Priesthood, the taking of the Ark of God by the Philistines, and
slaughter of thirty thousand footmen in one day. This was the Judgment befell
the first Priest and his house, who took upon him the supreme civil power and
magistracy. 4ly. Though Samuel himself was a 1 Samuel ^ and c. 9. and 10.
just Judge, 1 Samuel 11. 3, 4. 1 Samuel ^ c. 8. 1, to 13
yet his sons were wicked, (n) turning aside after Lucre, perverting Judgment,
in so much that all the Elders of Israel came to Samuel, complaining against
them, and peremptorily desired him, (o) TO MAKE THEM A KING OVER THEM to judge
them like all the Nations: not a Priest, being so weary of Priests supreme
Government, that they would never permit him nor his sons to judge and govern
them any longer, and were never satisfied till they had a King, which he made
them by Gods direct on and Election much against his own will. 5ly. All the
Priestly Offices and Jurisdiction he used toward them and Saul, was but to 1 Samuel c. 12. and 15, 16.
pray without ceasing for them, giving them good instructions, and reprehending
them for their sins, telling them, But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall
be consumed both you and your King, his declaring Saul King by Gods election
and the peoples doubled peremptory demand of a King, and approbation of Saul,
when presented to them; and his anointing David when a private person with oil
King after Saul's rejection by God, they were only Acts of Ministry; not of
Supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in the High Priest above the King; as I
shall prove in its due place more largely in the cloze of this Chapter.

4ly. When God settled the Kingdom of Israel upon 2 Samuel: 7, 8. to the end. Ps.
89, 3, 9, 29. 1 Chronicles. 17.
David and his posterity, in performance of his Genesis 17. 6 16. c. 35. 11.
promises to Abraham, Sarah and Jacob, that KINGS should come out of their
loins, he translated the Supreme Ecclesiastical as well as Civil Jurisdiction
to them, which they enjoyed, exercised by Gods approbation; not the high
Priest, Priests, or Levites: as the Scripture Annals attest.

1. Davia ( Acts 13. 22
a man after Gods own heart, which fulfilled all his will) not long after he
was anointed King over Israel and Judah, 2 Samuel 6. 1, to 20. 1 Chronicles. c. 13,
and 15, and 16, 1, 2
assembled all the whole Congregation, Priests, Levites of Israel, and went and
removed the Ark of God from Gibeah, with great triumph, joy and shouting, to
the House of Obed-Edom, and afterward into the place, tabernacle in the City
of David which David had there chosen and pitched for it, and offered there
burnt-offerings and peace offerings before the Lord, and he blessed the people
in the name of the Lord. 2ly. At the second removal of the Ark 1 Chronicles: 25. 1,
2, to 29.
he assembled not only the Elders, but the chief Priest and Levites; informing
them of their error in carrying the Ark in a cart at its first removal,
contrary to Moses command, for which God made a breach upon them; and that
Numb: 4. 2. 15. Exodus 25. 14.
None ought to carry the Ark of the Lord, but the Levites, for them had the
Lord chosen to carry the Ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever; For
violating which precept, Uzza was smitten to death before the Lord; Hereupon
David commanded the Priests and Levites to sanctify themselves to bring up the
Ark of the Lord God of Israel upon their shoulders, as Moses commanded; and to
appoint Singers with instruments of music and lifting up their voices, to sing
before it, when they removed it to the City of David; which command they
punctually obeyed. 3ly. He appointed and ordained certain of the Priests and
Levits to minister by turns before the Ark of the Lord, 1 Chronicles: 16. 4, to the
end. c: 21, 29, 30.
and to thank and praise the Lord God of Israel continually, prescribing them
what instruments of music they should use, what Psalms and Praises they should
sing, (most, or all of them compiled by himself) what burnt-offerings they
should offer upon the altar of the Lord morning and eveing continually,
according to the Law of the Lord, and to minister before the Ark continually,
as every days work required: And appointed others of the Priests and Levites
to minister continually in like manner before the Tabernacle of the Lord that
was in the high place at Gibeon. 4ly. He purposed, contrived, propounded to
Nathan, and ordained the building of a standing House and Temple, instead of a
moving Tabernacle and Tent, for the Ark and worship of God, and intended
himself to build it, 2 Samuel: 6. 1 Chronicles: 17. c: 18: 11: cap: 27. to c. 29. 1 Chronicles. 21. 18. to 30. Psalm. 24. 10, to 20.
had not God inhibited him, because he was a man of War and had shed much
blood, and appointed Solomon his Son and successor to build it; he provided all
sorts of materials for the building, and exhorted all the Princes and Elders of
the people to a liberal contribution toward it. 5ly. The Angel of the Lord
commanded David, to go and set up an Altar to the Lord in the threshing-floor
of Ornan, who accordingly went up at the saying of the Lord, and build there an
Altar, and offered burnt-offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the
Lord, who answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.
6ly. When he was old, and had made Solomon King, he gathered together all the
Princes, Priests and Levites, and when he had numbered the Priests and Levites,
he appointed them their several Courses, Services, Offices, Duties they should
perform before the Lord from time to time, as well before as after the Temple
was built, all which he set down in writing. 7ly. He, as Moses, assembled all
the Princes of Israel, and before all the Congregation, in the audience of God,
gave Solomon and them charge to serve and fear God, 1 Chronicles. 28. 1, to 14: 20,
21.
and build the Temple. Which done, he gave to Solomon the pattern of the Temple
and of the Houses thereof, and of the Treasures thereof, and of the upper
chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the Mercy-seat, and
the pattern of all that he had BY THE SPIRIT, of the courts of the House of the
Lord, and of all the chambers round about, of the Treasuries of the house of
God, and of the dedicated things; AND FOR THE COURSES OF THE PRIESTS AND
LEVITES, and for all the work of the Service of the House of the Lord, and for
all the vessels of service in the house of the Lord. And David said unto
Solomon, Be strong and of a good courage, and do it; fear not, nor be dismayed,
for the Lord God, even my God will be with thee, he will not fail thee nor
forsake thee, until thou have finished all the work for the service of the
House of the Lord: And BEHOLD THE COURSES OF THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES FOR
ALL THE SERVICE OF THE HOUSE OF GOD; and there shall be with thee for all
manner of w^rkmanship every willing skillful man for any manner of service, and
ALL THE PEOPLE WILL BE WHOLLY AT THY COMMAND. 7ly. 1 Chronicles. 16, 7, to 38: 2 Samuel: 23. 1, 3, etc: Luke 20: 42: Acts 1 16. c: 2. 25. c. 4. 25. Rom: 4: 6: c:
11: 3: Heb: 4. 7.
David (as King) not the Priests, compiled all or most of the Psalms and
Prayers afterward sung or used in the Temple, recorded in the Books of Samuel,
the Chronicles, and compiled together her in the Book of Psalms, continually
read, sung, used not only in the Temple and elsewhere by the Jewish, but in all
Christian Churches generally; and more frequently read, sung, commented upon,
then any other Book of Canonical Scripture. By all which memorable particulars,
and 1 Kings 1 34, 38.
command to the Priests to anoint Solomon King, it is most evident, that the
whole Supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over persons, causes things, relating
to Gods Worship remained entirely in David as King, and no part of it in the
Priests. Ps. 95: 2: Ps: 105, 2: Ephesians. 5: 19: Col: 3: 16: Jam: 5: 13:


5ly. King Solomon his Son succeeding David, by his Supreme Ecclesiastical
power, First, 2 Chronicles: 1. to c: 5: 2 Kings 6. to c. 9.
built and finished the Temple according to King David's model, and then
commanded all the Elders and Princes of Israel, with the Priests and Levites,
to carry the Ark and place it in the Temple. 2ly: The 1 Kings 8. 2 Chronicles. c. 6,
and 7.
King (not the Priests or Levites though all present) dedicated and consecrated
the Temple with a most Divine heavenly from of Prayer, answered and approved by
God, in sending down fire from heaven which consumed the burnt-offerings and
sacrifices, and filled the House with his glory, so that the Priests could not
enter into the house of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord had filled the
Lords House. 3ly. He 2 Chronicles. 7
also hallowed the middle of the outward Court by offering burnt-offerings and
peace offerings there. 4ly. He 2 Chronicles: 8 12, 13.
appointed all burnt-offerings to the Lord after a certain rate every day,
(according to the commandment of Moses) on the Sabbath, and on the New Moons,
and on the solemn Feasts of unleavened bread, of Weeks and of Tabernacles. 5ly
He 2 Chronicles. 5 11, 12.
assembled all the Priests and Levites to Jerusalem at the Temples Dedication,
not in their courses: But that solemnity ended, He (as King) 2 Chronicles. 7. 6, etc.
appointed (according to the order of David his Father) THE COURSES OF THE
PRIESTS TO THEIR SERVICE, AND THE LEVITES TO THEIR CHARGES, to praise and
minister before the Lord as the duty of every day required; Porters also by
their courses for every gate, FOR SO HAD DAVID the man of God COMMANDED: And
THEY DEPARTED NOT FROM THE COMMANDMENT OF THE KING UNTO THE PRIESTS AND
LEVITES CONCERNING ANY MATTER, or concerning the Treasures. Here is Supreme
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction vested in, and exercised by this King in and over
all Ecclesiastical persons, matters, and exact canonical obedience yielded to
King David's, and King Solomon's Canons; not to the High Priests, Priests or
Levites, who had then no power to make or impose such Canons or Injunctions, as
Popes and Popish Prelates now do, without any Scripture president for their
warrant. 6ly. This King was the inspired penman of three whole Books of
Canonical Scripture, the Proverbs, Solomon's Song, and Ecclesiastes; but no
Priest or Levite we read of either in his or his Father David's reign. 7ly. He
(as King) 1 Kings 2. 26, 27, 35.
thrust out Abiathar FROM BEING PRIEST TO THE LORD, banished him from
Jerusalem, and might have put him to death for his Treason in crowning Adonijah
King, but saved his life for this reason, because he had born the Ark of the
Lord God before David his Father, and been afflicted with him in all his
afflictions, and put Zadoc the Priest in his room. Here is Regal Supreme
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction exercised over the High Priests themselves.

6ly. 2 Chronicles. 14. 3, 4, 5. etc. 1 Kings 15. 8, etc.
King Asa (as King) First, took away the Altars of the strange Gods, and the
High Places, and brake down the Images, and cut down the groves through all the
Cities of Judah, and commanded Judah to serve the Lord God of their Fathers,
and to do the Law and the Commandments; and afterward did the like in
Benjamin, and the cities he had taken from Mount Ephraim. 2ly. 2 Chronicles. 15. 10,
to 16.
He renewed the Altar of the Lord which was before the porch; and gathered all
Judah, Ephraim, Benjamin, and others to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices of the
spoils they had taken, unto God; which done, He (as King) made them enter into
a Covenant, to seek the Lord God of their Fathers with all their heart and with
all their soul; that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be
put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman; and they swear unto
the Lord with a loud voice, and with shoutings, with trumpets, and with
cornets, and all Judah rejoiced at the Oath for they had sworn with all their
heart. 3ly. 2 Chronicles. 15 16. 1 Kings 15 13.
He removed Maachah his mother from being Queen, because she had made an Idol
in a Grove, and burned her Idol at the brook Kidron. 4ly. 2 Chronicles. 15 18. 1
Kings 15 16.
He brought into the house of the Lord all the things, gold, silver, vessels,
himself and his Father had dedicated. All evidences, acts of his Sovereign
Spiritual Jurisdiction.

4ly. King Johoshaphat his Son, 1. 2 Chronicles. 17. 7, 8, 9.
commanded the Levites, accompanied with some Princes, to oversesee, encourage,
assist them to go and teach Gods Law to all the people throughout all the
Cities of Judah, and to carry the Book of the Law with them, which they did
accordingly, 2ly. He 2 Chronicles. 19 4.
went out again the second time through the people, from Beersheba to Mount
Ephraim, and brought them back to the Lord God of their Fathers. 3ly. He
appointed not only 2 Chronicles. 29. 5, to the end. See Deuteronomy. 17. 8. to 14.
Temporal Judges, City by City, through all Judah, but likewise Judges
Delegates at Jerusalem in cases of appeals between blend and blood, Law and
Commandment, Statute and Judgments, wherein he joined some of the Levites,
Priests and chief Fathers of Israel, and Amaziah the chief Priest, in all
matters of and judgments for the Lord (as his subordinate Judges, receiving
their Commissions from him) and gave them an Excellent admonition how to judge,
and proceed uprightly. 4ly. 2 Chronicles. 20. 3, etc.
He proclaimed a solemn Fast throughout all Judah to come to Jerusalem to seek
the Lord for help against a great host of invading Enemies; where he (nor the
Priests) stood in the Congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the House of the
Lord before the Court; and made a most pertinent effectual Prayer to God, which
God answered with a miraculous victory, causing his enemies to destroy one
another, without fighting them; and giving his Army all the spoil: For which
victory he commanded them to return to Jerusalem to give public thanks to God.

5ly. 1 Kings 12. 5. to 17.
King Jehoash commanded the Priests to repair all the breaches of the Lords
House with the moneys, and the dedicated things brought into it; and called for
and reprehended Jehoiada the High Priest and the other Priests for their
negligence in not repairing them as he commanded; whereupon they received no
more money, and repaired the House.

6ly. King Hezekiah by his Regal power, 1. 2 Chronicles. 29. 31, to 36.
Opened the doors of the House of the Lord, (which had been shut up by his
idolatrous Predecessors) and repaired them; gathered the Priests and Levites
together, brought them into the Lords house; commanded them to sanctify
themselves and then the house, by carrying all the filth out of the holy place,
and cleansing the holy vessels: Then made a second exhortation to them, and
strictly commanded them diligently to discharge their respective duties without
ceasing. All which they executed according to the Command of the King in the
Business of the Lord. 2ly. 2 Chronicles. c. 29, and 30.
He (afterward) commanded the Priests to offer burnt sacrifices, and the
Levites to praise God in the Temple, according to the Commandment of David.
And He set all the services of the House of God in Order. Moreover the KING,
and the Princes, commanded the Levites to sing praises to the Lord with the
words of David, and they sang praises with gladness. 3ly. This King (taking
counsel with his Princes and the Congregation at Jerusalem) 2 Chronicles. 30.
throughout
made a Decree and sent forth a solemn Proclamation, inviting and commanding
all Judah and Israel to keep a solemn Passover at Jerusalem on the second
Month; whereupon a great multitude then and there assembling, they took away
the Idols, altars, and cast them into the book Kidron, and killed the
Passover; Whereupon the Priests and Levites being ashamed of their bacwardness
in this service, sanctified themselves, brought the burnt offerings into the
house of the Lord, stood in their places after their manner, according to the
Law of Moses, and sprinkled the blood. 4ly. Hezekiah (not the Priests)
publicly 2 Chronicles. 31. throughout.
prayed to God, to pardon those who prepared their hearts to seek God, though
they were not sanctified and prepared according to the purification of the
Sanctuary; and spoke comfortably to the Levites that taught the good Law of the
Lord. 5ly. This King 2 Chronicles. 31 12, 15, 16, 17.
Appointed the Courses of the Priests and Levites after their Courses, every
man according to his Service; appointed the Kings portion for all morning and
evening sacrifices for every day, Sabbath, Feast, as it is written in the Law
of the Lord; and commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the
portion of the Priests and Levites that they might be encouraged in the Law of
the Lord; whereupon all the people brought in the First Fruits and Tithes of
all things abundantly; which Hezekiah commanded to be put in storehouses built
by his command, over which he appointed Rulers, to distribute to every Priest
and Levite his portion. All undoubted Badges of his Supreme Ecclesiastical
Authority.

7ly. King Josiah by his Regal Jurisdiction: 1. 2 Chronicles. 33. 3, etc.
Purged Judah and Jerusalem from their high places, groves, carved Images and
molten Images, brake down the Altars of Baal, and cut down the Images that were
above them, and brake in pieces the carved and molten Images, and stamped them
to powder; and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed to them,
and burnt the bones of their Priests upon their Altars: and so did he in the
Cities of Manasseth, Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Napthali. 2ly. 2 Chronicles. c.
34. throughout.
He assembled all the Elders of Judah, inhabitants of Jerusalem, Priests,
Levites, and all the people great and small into the Temple, and HE READ in
their ears all the Book of the Covenant that was found in the House of the
Lord: Then the King stood in his place, and made a Covenant before the Lord, to
walk after the Lord, and to keep his Commandments, Testimonies and Statutes
with all his heart, and with all his soul; and caused all there present to
stand to the Covenant and Oath. 3ly. 2 Chronicles. 34, 33.
He took away all the abominable things out of all the Countries that pertained
to the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Israel (Priests and
people) to serve the Lord their God: And all his days they departed not from
serving the Lord God of their Fathers. 4ly. 2 Chronicles. 35. 1. to 20.
He assembled the Princes, and he kept a most solemn Passover to the Lord in
Jerusalem the 14. day of the first month: And He set the Priests in their
Charges; and encouraged them in the service of the house of the Lord; and
commanded the Levites that taught all Israel, to prepare themselves by the
Houses of their Fathers after their courses according to the writing of David
King of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his Son; and said to
them, stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the
fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of
the Levites; So kill the Passover, and sanctify your selves, and prepare your
Brethren that they may do according to the word of the Lord by the hand of
Moses; Whereupon they all prepared, performed their respective offices and
duties in celebrating the Passover, as this pious King prescribed. Lo here no
less then 7. most renowned pious Kings recorded in Sacred story by divine
approbation, exercising Supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over High Priests,
Priests, and Levites themselves, ordering all sacred affairs, offerings,
sacrifices, Psalms, prayers courses of Priests appertaining to Gods worship,
building, consecrating, repairing, cleansing the Temple, destroying Idolatry,
with other particulars.

5ly. From Moses, Joshuahs and their presidents I shall observe, 1. That they
are all specially recorded in sacred Writ for their eternal honors,
reputations, and the 1 Cor. 10. 11. Jam. 5. 10. Jude 7.
example of all other pious Kings under the Gospel. 2ly. That not one of them
was ever taxed by God or the high Priests, for invading or usurping their
Jurisdictions or Offices, for any of their forecited actions, injunctions,
commands over them, or exercising these high points of Monarchical and Regal
Jurisdiction in and over all Ecclesiastical affairs; or the essential,
ceremonial parts of Gods public worship: Which Popes and Popish Prelates would
repute the highest, most sacrilegious Encroachment upon their Ecclesiastical
Rights, and Jurisdictions, if now acted by Christian Kings, Magistrates,
Rulers, and excommunicate them for it by Bell, Book and Candle. 3ly. That we
find no one part of Ecclesiastical power and Jurisdiction in these or any other
particulars, either exercised or claimed by the high Priest, Priests Levites,
either jointly or severally, all their reigns. 4ly. There are only Two Kings
(but no other Magistrate) in sacred History reprehended by the high Priest, and
punished by God for invading the Priests Office and Function, and that only in
one particular Ministerial, not Jurisdictional sacred action, peculiar unto
Priests by Gods own restriction. The first is of 1 Samuel 13, to 15.
King Saul, who sending for Samuel to Gilgal to offer Sacrifices and enquire of
the Lord for help against the Philistims, and he staying seven days for him,
and the people scattering themselves from him; thereupon he calling for a burnt
offering and peace offering, offered the burnt offering to the Lord himself;
Which he had no sooner done, but Samuel came: and Saul telling him how he had
in this extremity forced himself, and offered a burnt offering to the Lord.
Samuel thereupon said to Saul, Thou have done very foolishly, thou have not
kept the commandment of the Lord thy God which he commanded thee, for the Lord
had now established the kingdom of Israel upon thee for ever: but now thy
kingdom shall not continue. The second is 2 Chronicles. 26. 16, to 22.
King Vzziah, who being lifted up with pride and prosperity to his destruction,
transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the Temple of the Lord to
burn incense upon the Altar of incense; whereupon Azariah the Priest went in
after him with fourscore more Priests of the Lord that were valiant man, and
withstood the King, and said unto him, It pertains not to thee Vzziah to burn
incense unto the Lord, but to the Numb. 16. 17. Exodus 30. 7. Luke 1. 8. 9.
Priests the Sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense; Go out of the
Sanctuary, for thou have trespassed, neither shall it be for thy honor from
the Lord God. Then Vzziah was wroth with the Priests, and took a censor in his
hand to burn incense; whereupon the Leprosy rose up in his Forehead before the
Priests in the House of the Lord, from beside the incense Altar, which Azariah
the chief Priest, and all the Priests looking upon, drove, and thrust him out
from thence; yea, himself also hasted to go out, because the Lord had smitten
him: And he continued a Leper until the day of his death, and dwelt in a
several house being a Leper, for he was cut off from the house of the Lord, and
Jotham his Son was over the Kings house, judging the people of the Land. Had
the exercise of Supreme Ecclesiastical power in all the premised particulars
been any usurpation of the Priests Office in Moses, Joshua, David, Solomon,
Asa, Jehoash, Hezekiah, or Josiah, no doubt God would have punished them as
exemplarily for it, as he punished King Saul, and King Uzziah for offering a
burnt offering, and burning incense upon the Altar of incense; Or as he did
Number. 16. 1, to 20.
Corah, Dathan and Abiram before them; for rebelling and usurping the Priests
Office in burning incense with their censers, as Vzziah intended to do; Or as
he punished and slew 1 Samuel 6. 19, 20.
the men of Bethshemesh, for looking irreverently into the Ark; and 1 Chronicles.
13. 9, 10. 2 Samuel 8. 6, 7.
Vzza for stretching out his hand to hold the Ark steady when it ^^ook in the
Cart; when as Numb 4. 15 1 Chronicles. 1^. 2.
none but Levites were by Gods special precept to come near, bear, or touch it;
whose office all these directly invaded, for which they were thus signally
punished by God himself; But since neither of all these Kings, Rulers, received
any check, punishment at all from God, or the high Priests, but on the
contrary, praise, honor, blessings from God, and cheerful obedience from all
the high Priests, Priests, Levites themselves, for these their sacred
Ecclesiastical transactions; they were doubtless no parts of the high Priests,
Priests or Levites Offices, but of their own proper, inherent Supreme
Magistratical and Regal Authority, vested in them for these ends by God himself.

6ly. When the 2 Kings 17 and 25. 2 Chronicles 36.
Kings, Kingdoms of Judah and Israel were destroyed for their Idolatry, and
both Kings, Princes, people carried away Captives into foreign Nations, so that
they had Hosea 3. 4. c. 10. 3. Ezech. 17.
no King nor Magistrate of their own to govern them, the sacred story records,
that even Heathen Kings exercised Supreme Authority over them in all Religious
and Ecclesiastical matters, as these presidents demonstrate.

1. The 2 Kings 17 25, to 20.
King of Assyria sent one of the Priests they had carried away captive, to the
Nations he had placed in and about Samaria, instead of the Israelites, to teach
them the manner of the God of the Land, and to fear the Lord.

God stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King of Persia, to make a public
Proclamation through all his kingdom in writing, for every man that would to go
up to Jerusalem, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel (who had charged
him to build it) and that all should assist them with silver, gold, beasts,
besides the free will offering for the House of the Lord; Whereupon God
stirring up the spirits of the chief of the Fathers of Judah, Ephraim, Priests,
Levites, and others to undertake the work, King Cyrus brought forth the vessels
of the House of the Lord which Nebuchadnezzer had taken from thence, and put in
the house of his Gods, and delivered them to them by number, all which they
carried to Jerusalem for the use of the Temple when rebuilt; and all they that
were about them (in obedience to Cyrus royal Proclamation) strengthened their
hands with vessels of gold, goods, beasts and precious things, besides all
willingly offered. Whence God said of Isay 44 28. c. 45. 1.
Cyrus, He is my Shepherd, and shall fulfill all my pleasure, saying to
Jerusalem thou shall be built, and to the Temple thy foundations shall be laid;
and styled him, HIS ANOINTED. Upon which Proclamation and Grant of Cyrus, the
Jews set up the Altar, offered Sacrifices, and laid the foundation of the
Temple, as King Cyrus, King of Persia had commanded them.

3ly. King Ezra 5. 13. to 17 c. 6. throughout.
Darius confirmed and enlarged this Decree of Cyrus, commanding his Officers
not to hinder the building, to furnish them with moneys out of the Kings
tribute for the work, and with young Bullocks, Lambs, Rams for burnt offerings
of the God of Heaven, wheat, salt, wine, oil, according to the appointment of
the Priests at Jerusalem, to be given them day by day without fail; that they
may offer Sacrifices of rest to the God of Heaven, and pray for the life of the
King and of his Sons; clozing his Decree thus; Also I have made a Decree,
That whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house,
and being set up, let him be hanged thereon, and let his house be made a
Dunghill for this; And the God that has caused his name to dwell there,
destroy all Kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter or destroy
this House of God which is at Jerusalem: I Darius have made a Decree, let it be
done with speed; Whereupon the Jews built and finished the House, offered
Sacrifices, set up Gods worship in it, according to the commandment of the God
of Israel, and according to the Commandment of Cyrus, Darius and Artarerres
King of Persia.

4ly. This Ezra 7. c. 8. 24. to the end.
King Artaxerxes sent Ezra the Priest up to Jerusalem, and gave him sundry
Vessels for the Lords house, with a large Commission to like effect with that
of Darius, recorded Ezra 7. superadding, Whatsoever is commanded by the God of
Heaven, let it be done diligently for the house of the Lord of heaven, for why
should wrath come upon the King and his sons. And thou Ezra (as my
Commissioner) after the wisdom of thy God, set Magistrates and Judges, which
may judge all the people that are beyond the River, all such as know the Law of
thy God, and teach ye them that know it not. And whosoever will not do the Law
of thy God, and the Law of the King, let judgment be executed ^eedily upon
him, whether unto death, or unto banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to
imprisonment; (all Temporal and Ecclesiastical Censures to be executed by Civil
Magistrates, not Ezra the Priest) Upon receipt of which Commission, Ezra used
this Thanksgiving: Blessed be the Lord God of our Fathers, which has put such
a thing as this into the Kings heart to beautify the House of the Lord, etc.
Which Commission he punctually pursued, and delivered it to the Kings
Lieutenants and Governors; who thereupon furthered the people and the House of
God. This King likewise Neh. 2. 7, 8, 9.
granted his Royal Letters to Nehemah, commanding the Governors there to give
him Timber and stone for the building of the Temple; who as the Kings
Lieutenant over the Jews there, exercised Supreme Ecclesiastical Authority in
building the Temple directing and ordering the Priests and Levites, setting up
the public worship of God, observing the Sabbath and solemn Festivals,
constituting public Fasts, and putting the Priests from their Priesthood, and
the Levites who could not prove their pedigrees; causing all of them that had
married strange wives to enter into a Covenant, to walk in Gods Laws, given by
Moses, not to marry with strangers, pay all their tithes, offerings,
first fruits for the maintenance of Gods worship, Priests and Levites, whom he
set in their courses and respective offices; as is recorded at large in Neh.

Layman, and no Priest,

5ly. Esther 4. 17, to 32.
Mordecai the Jew, who was next to King Ahashuerus, and Esther the Queen, by
this Kings consent, instituted and by their own Decrees confirmed, the days
and feast of Purim, wherein God gave them rest and deliverance from their
Enemies, to be days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions to one
another, and gifts to the poor, and that these days should be remembered and
kept through every generation, every family, every province and every City; and
that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial
of them from their seed. And many conceive Mordecai was the penman of this
Canonical History, though no Priest.

6ly. Dan. 3. 1, to 30.
King Nebuchadnezzer, as he exercised the Supreme Ecclesiastical Authority
within his Empire, in Erecting a golden image, and commanding all his Subjects
of what condition or Nation soever, to fall down and worship it, under pain of
being cast into the fiery furnace; which Decree all but Shadrac, Mesac and
Abednago obeyed; he commanding them to be cast into this furnace for disobeying
his Decree: So after their miraculous preservation in, and deliverance out of
this furnace without any touch or smell of fire; he made this memorable pious
Decree; That every people, Nation and Language, that spoke any thing amiss
against the God of Shadrac, Mesac and Abednago, shall be cut in pieces, and
their houses shall be made a Dunghill, because there is no other God that can
deliver after this sort.

7ly. The Jonah 2. 5. to 10
King of Nineveh, when he heard tidings of Jonah his Message from God which he
cried in the streets thereof by Gods command, Yet forty days and Nineveh shall
be overthrown; to prevent this denounced Judgment, caused it to be proclaimed
and published throughout Nineveh, (BY THE DECREE OF THE KING AND HIS NOBLES,
not Priests) saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock taste anything,
let them not feed, nor drink waeer, but let man and beast be covered with
sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God; yea let them turn every one from his evil
way, and from the violence that is in their hand; who can tell if God will turn
and repent from his fierce anger, that we perish not; whereupon they fasted,
and put on sackcloth, from the greatest unto the least, and the King himself
was covered with sackcloth and ashes, and they turned from their evil way, and
God pented of the evil he said he would do unto them, and did it not.

By all these presidents recorded by the Spirit of God in Canonical Scripture,
it is infallibly evident; That from Moses, till the last King of Judah and
Israel, and during their Captivity; yea from the very first chapter in Genesis,
till the last of Malachi, the Supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in and over
all persons, things, causes in and over the Church and people of God, resided
totally in, and was executed by the Supreme Temporal Magistrates, Kings,
Governors, (and so in Pagan kingdoms too) and was never so much as once
seated in, claimed, usurped, or managed by any one Ex ea part qua illud

High Priest, Priest, Levite, or other Ecclesiastical person whatsoever, no not
in divine and sacred affairs; much less is there the least shadow of any such
transcendent Jurisdiction in them, over Kings and Civil Magistrates, or their
Subjects, as all Popes, (and most Popish Prelates, Priests too of inferior
rank) now claim, usurp, exercise, by a pretended Divine Right, not to be found
out or really grounded in the least on any place or president in the Old
Testament, from Adam till our Saviors incarnation.

7ly. After the Jews return from the Babylonish Captivity, though the High
Priests during their unsettled estate, frequent wars with, and captivity to the
Romans, and others, usurped, exercised some kind of Ecclesiastical and Civil
Jurisdiction too, which God never transferred to them by divine Authority, nor
any of their predecessors exercised under their Judges or Kings; yet the
Supreme Civil and Ecclesiastical Authority (which they frequently annexed to
the Civil) remained always in their Chief Temporal Princes, Kings, whom they
made their High Priests too, or they made themselves both Princes, Kings and
High Priests by usurpation, fraud and bloodshed. After the extinction of the
whole lineage of Aaron, ^^estat de la Religion and Republique de peuple Judaique

both a Civil and Ecclesiastical power in religious matters, having a John 7.

twice apprehended, examined the Apostles for preaching in the Temple,
commanding them to preach no more in the name of the Lord Jesus; which they
refused to do: whereupon they only threatened and let them go at first; but when
brought before them the second time for preaching openly in the Temple, and
filling Jerusalem with their doctrine, notwithstanding their threats and
inhibitions, they then beat and let them go; charging them, not to speak any
more in the name of Jesus. Yet they were so far from obeying their commands as
Legal, or them as the Supreme Ecclesiastical power to which they were bound in
conscence to submit, that on the contrary, Acts 5. 42.
they daily in the Temple and in every house ceased not to teach and preach
Jesus Christ. Soon after Acts 6. 12. ^o 15. c. 7. 1, 2, etc.
Stephen was brought before this Council, and there accused of blasphemy, and
in the midst of his Apology stoned to death by the rude multitude. Yea Acts 7.

Paul, by Letters and Authority from the High Priest, made havoc of the
Church, and apprehended those that professed Christ, whether men or women, and
haled them to prison, persecuting them even to strange Cities, and left them in
bonds: Yet when he was converted, and preached Christ, himself Acts 23. 1, 2,
4, 5. 2 Cor. ^. 6. c. 11. 23, ^
was apprehended and brought before the Council, and Ananias the High Priest,
who commanded him to be smitten on the face when he began to speak, and he was
5. times beaten with rods, receiving 40. stripes save one, as a penal
punishment; Yet neither the high Priest nor the Council were the Supreme Judges
in Causes Ecclesiastical, but the Roman Governors, Rulers, and Caesar; Hence
the high Priest, with the Elders and Council, by Tertullus their Orator,
accused Paul, first before Felix the Governor for Acts 25. 1, to 27.
being a stirrer up of sedition among all the Jews in the world, and
ringleader of the sect of the Nazarens; before whom Paul made his defense;
Afterward he was accused by them before Portius Festus the succeeding
Governor, who demanded of him, Will thou go up to Jerusalem, and THERE BE
JUDGED BEFORE ME, (not the High Priest or Council) of those things whereof he
was accused? Acts 26. 9, 10, 11, 12, etc.
Whereupon Paul doubting his justice, made this Appeal to Caesar himself, (as
Supreamest Judge in all Ecclesiastical causes) I STAND AT CAESAR'S JUDGMENT
SEAT WHERE I OUGHT TO BE JUDGED, etc. No man may deliver me to the Jews, I
APPEAL UNTO CAESAR: Then Festus when he had consulted with the Council,
answered; Have thou appealed unto Caesar, UNTO CAESAR SHALL THOU GO. Festus
soon after informing King Agrippa that Paul had referred himself to the hearing
and Judgment of Augustus, heard him again the second time before King Agrippa;
who resolved, This man might have been set at liberty, had he not appealed Acts
c. 26. 27, and 28.
unto Caesar, to whose Tribunal he was thereupon sent a prisoner to Rome to
Caesar himself, as the Sovereign Judge as well in Religious as Civil causes,
persons, though a Pagan. Moreover Saint Paul having cast a spirit of divination
out of a Damsel at Philippi, the chief City of that part of Macedonia, it is
specially recorded, Acts 16. to the end.
When her Masters saw that the hope of their Gains was gone, they caught Paul
and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the Rulers, and brought
them to the Magistrates, saying, These men being Jews do exceedingly trouble
our City, and teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive, neither
to observe, being Romans: And the multitude rose up together against them, and
the Magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them; And when
they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the
Jailer to keep them safely: who having received such a charge, thrust them into
the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the flocks; But the next morning
upon Paul's message, the Magistrates released and brought them out of prison
themselves. In fine, our Savior foretold his Apostles Luke 21. 12. Mat. 10.
17, 18. Mar. 13. 9.
They shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the
Synagogues, and into Prisons, being brought before KINGS and RULERS for my name
sake, for a testimony against them: compared with Christ's prohibition to his
Disciples; Lu. 22. 25.
The Kings of the Gentiles exercise Lordship over them, and they that exercise
Authority upon them are called Benefactors; But ye shall not be so: and with
the forecited Texts, are a most clear convincing Evidence, that although the
Jewish high Priests and Priests usurped rather a Temporal then Ecclesiastical
power to fetch the Apostles before and scourge them in their Synagogues to
apprehend them by their Mat. 26. 3. c. 21. 23. Mar. 15 1. Lu. 23. 5. 66. Acts

Officers, Soldiers, drag and cast men and women into prison for preaching and
professing Christ, and that not severally by themselves, but in a mixed Council
of Elders, Scribes and Pharisees, (who were no Priests) sitting, advising, and
voting with them; Yet the Supreme power in matters of Doctrine and Religion
even amongst the Jews during our Saviors abode with them, and after his
Ascension, continued in the Roman Deputies, Kings, Emperors, and chief Civil
Magistrates alone, as they did by divine institution in Moses, Joshua, David,
Solomon, and other their own forementioned Kings and Supreme Temporal
Governors.

Sanhedrim, consisting of 71. persons of the Elders, Heads and Princes of
Israel, as the Jewish Rabbis and those who write of the Jewish Courts collect
from Numb. 11. 16. where (they hold) it was first erected; and conceive it was
like our Parliaments, having conusance of all highest affairs. I confess I
could never yet be satisfied by any Text of Scripture, or solid Antiquity, 1.
That this Court of 71. or Sanhedrim, was a settled standing Court sitting
usually at Jerusalem, and that during the Judges, Kings, and inter-regnums too,
till Herod put it down. 2ly. That the high Priests or any Levites were
anciently Members of it; which Godwin and others utterly deny. 3ly. That they
intermedled with any Ecclesiastical causes as Supreme Judges of them, as some
allege they did in the case of the Jer. 26. 6. 10 42.
Prophet Jeremiah, where when the malicious Priests, Prophets, and all the
people pronounced him (I conceive only by way of accusation, as in the case of
Christ before Pilate, when they cried out, Let him be crucified; not vote or
Judgment) to be worthy of death; the Princes of Judah who heard tidings
thereof, came up from the Kings house and sat down in the Porch of the house
of the Lord, and when they had heard Jeremiah his Apology and their clamours,
adjudged, voted the contrary, that he was not worthy to die, and saved his
life, which proves the Princes only, not the Priests or Prophets, to be Judges
paramount, even in Ecclesiastical causes, persons; not the Priests, in their
imaginary Consistory, Church, Council, 4ly. It is granted by De Republ. Jud. l.
6. c. 7.
Sigonius, Dr. Field of the Church, b. 5. Chapter 10.
Dr. Field, most Jewish Rabbis, Antiquaries, that the Princes of Judah and
Israel before the Babilonish captivity, sat Chief Presidents in this high
Court, as they do in our Parliaments, and that nothing was there passed but by
their assents thereto, till the high Priest after that restitution by
usurpation, not right, sat Chief therein. Therefore if we admit any such
Sovereign standing Court erected and continuing so long, (as See Mr. Gela^py
his Aarons Rod bloss^ming.
some pretend, to erect such a Presbytery in themselves) having conusance of
Ecclesiastical persons or causes as well as Temporal, or a kind of
Ecclesiastical Consistory styled a Council, which some would difference from
it, (though I hold them both one and the same, erected, devised by their
Elders, Princes, Priests after their return from the Babilonish captivity) it
will no ways enervate, but ratify my second Proposition; That the Sovereign
Ecclesiastical Authority in the Israelitish Church of God under the Law,
remained always settled by Divine and Natural Right in their Kings and chief
Civil Magistrates, Princes, Councils, not in their High Priest, Priests or
Levites separated or conjoined; and that the Civil and Ecclesiastical power are
but one and the same in nature, distinguished only by the Civil or
Ecclesiastical objects, about which they are exercised, not in their original,
subject, or power it self.

Before I proceed to the next Proposition, it will be necessary to answer 4.
principal Arguments, Presidents, out of the Old Testament, before and under the
Law, produced by Popes and their Parasites, to evidence their pretended
Universal Spiritual and Temporal Jurisdiction too, over the Persons, Crowns,
Kingdoms of all Kings, Princes, and the Emperor himself, to dispose of them at
their absolute Wills, as derived only from, and held under them; which my
Chronological Method confines me here to propound and answer in their order.

The first is that alleged by Pope Innocent the 3d. the first Pope who Mat.

Excommunicated King John, and by force and frauds induced him to resign his
Kingdoms of England and Ireland to, and resume them from him under an Annual
rent, and to do Homage to him for them as his Vassal: This Pope in an Epistle
to the Emperor of Constantinople, uses this Argument, before Adams creation,
to maintain his Temporal Monarchy: Innocentii 3. Opera. Tom. 2. p. 644. et cap.

Moreover, you ought to know, that God has made two great Lights in the
firmament of heaven; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to
rule the night: both of them great, but the other greater; Ad firmamentum
igitur Coeli, hoc est Universalis Ecclesiae, fecit Deus duo magna luminaria,
etc. Therefore God has made two great lights to rule the firmament of heaven,
to wit, of the Universal Church; that is, he has instituted TWO DIGNITIES,
quae sunt Pontificalis authoritas, and Regalis potestas, which are The
Pontifical Authority, and the Regal Power. But that which rules in the day,
that is, in Spiritual things, major est, is the Greater, but that which in
carnal things, minor, is the Lesser, ut quanta est inter Solemn and Lunam, tanta
inter Pontifices and Reges differentia cognoscatur, (mark it) that it might be
known there is as great a difference between Popes and Kings, as there is
betweeen the Sun and Moon. How great this difference is, this Pope defines
not; But some illiterate Canonists and Glossa. in cap. Solita.
Glossers on this Text (not well versed in Astronomy) resolve the Sun to be
47. times greater then the Moon; whereas Com. in ^ohan. de Sacrobosco. p. 189.
Dr. C^^kenthorp of the Popes Temporal Monarchy, p. 10.
Johannes Clavius and other Astronomers determine it to be no less then 6529.
degrees greater then it: and by consequence the Pope to be so many degrees
greater then the Emperor, by this Popes Resolution in his over-erring chair.
He subjoyns. If his Imperial Highness would prudently consider these things,
he would not make or permit the Patriarch of Constantinople, a great and
honorable Member of the Church, to sit on the left side near his Footstool;
when as other Kings and Princes (sicut debent) AS THEY OUGHT, reverently rise
up to, and assign them a venerable Chair next them (on their right hand:) Nos
autem, etsi non increpando scripserimus, potuissemus tamen rationabiliter
increpare.

Mauritius de Alzedo, a Spanish Doctor of the Canon Law, in his highly approved
and applauded Book, De Praecellentia Episcopalis dignitatis, concludes from
this Popes Text; That there is as vast a difference between the Episcopal and
Regal dignity (not Papal only) as there is between the Sun and Moon; quoting
many Canonists, Divines, Politians, and Cardinal Bellarmin himself, in his
Apologia pro Responsione ad JACOBUM REGEM ANGLIAE, averring it; Yet Guil.

Monarchy, p. 7, ^.
Pope Sixtus the 5. was so angry with Bellarmin, for not asserting the direct,
but oblique, dominion of Popes over Kings in all Temporal things in this
Apology, that he purposed to have burnt and totally abolished this his Book AS
HERETICAL; And that upon reading of Alex: Carerius his Book (purposely written
against Bellarmins) Adversus Impios Politicos and Haereticos hujus Temporis;
branding all for impious Heretics who denied the Popes direct Universal
Dominion in Temporal things, though they acknowledged it obliquely in-order to,
and absolutely in all Spiritual things: In this applauded Book, Lib. 2. c. 5.
nu. 12. De Romans Pontifice.
Carerius asserts, There is that proportion between the Pope and the Emperor,
as is between the Sun and Moon, not only in Magnitude, but Splendour too. For,
as the Sun is far more excellent and eminent then the Moon, seeing she borrows
her splendour and light of the Sun; SO IS THE POPE THEN THE EMPEROR; seeing his
Authority depends on the Pope, and is derived from him: Our own Doctrinalis
Fide^, Tom. 1. Venetiis 1571. b. 2. Artic. 3. cap. 74, 75. p. 177, etc.
Thomas Waldensis alluding thereunto, professedly asserts against Wickliffs
defense of our Kings Supreme Jurisdiction over Priests and Prel^tes, That
Priests (as well as Bishops) ARE TO BE PREFERRED BEFORE ALL OTHER EARTHLY
PRINCES WHATSOEVER, and the Priesthood before the Kingship, as far as the Flesh
before the Spirit, Gold before Lead, the Soul before the body, and Heaven
BEFORE EARTH; in proof whereof he spends two whole Chapters, and De Planctu

That God created the Sun to Govern the day, and the Moon the night, by a
direct divine inviolable and irrevocable Institution, observed from the
Creation till now: when Pope Innocent and his flatterers can produce any such
divine Law and constitution, made either by God at the creation, or by Moses
for the Jews High Priests Supremacy, or by Kings, Princes, or Christ himself
under the Gospel, to convince any rational Christian, that Popes and Prelates
are the sole Universal Governors in the Church, but Kings and Emperors only
in the World; That Popes or Bishops were ever typified by the Sun and Moon;
the Church and Earthly kingdoms by Day and Night; That there is as vast a
difference between the Amplitude of Jurisdiction, and Splendour of Popes,
Bishops, Kings and Emperors, as is between the Grandeur and Brightness of the
Sun and Moon; That Kings and Emperors derive all their Regal Authority,
Crowns, Kingdoms; Splendour, Excellency in the world from Popes Miters, or
Bishops Crosiers; not God himself; (as the 2 Chronicles. 9. 8. Prove. 8. 15, 16. Romans

Old and New Testament, Paul and Peter (the first pretended Bishop of Rome it
self) dogmatically resolve) as the Moon borrows her light and splendour from the
Sun, (as some assert, but others rationally deny, being both made at once

by God on the fourth day, two days before Adam the first man was created, and
some thousands of years before Popes, Prelates, the Grecian or Roman Emperors
were extant in the world (and so could not typifie either of them, as these
Pontificians dream.) Or when they can evidence, that God has constituted Popes
to rule, govern, and give light to the whole World by day only; and to the
Emperor alone (not Pope) by night; as the Sun and Moon govern, alternis
vicibus, without encroaching on one the others turns; when as Popes, Prelates
usurp the Temporal Rights of all Emperors, Kings, as well as Ecclesiastical all
the year long; I shall then subscribe these Popes and Doctors conclusions as
Catholic verities; whereas yet I cannot but conclude them 2 These. 2. 10, 11.
strong Antichristian delusions, lies, which few sober men will credit. In the
mean time, since Kings, Emperors were long before Popes, Bishops, who derive
all their Lordly power, Splendour, Temporalties, Jurisdictions, Bishoprics,
precedence above other Ministers only from their donations; not they their
Crowns, Kingdoms or Regal Authority from Popes or Bishops, as all Histories
attest, against their Papal pretenses to the contrary: Since the Moon does
frequently eclipse the Sun by the interposition of her body between it and
the earth; as the Papal and Pontifical power has frequently ecclipsed more or
less the power, splendour of our own and other Kings and the Roman Emperors)

Constitutions, Decrees, Ceremonies, Franchises of Popes, Prelates, are still
various and subject to change, like the Moon; the Light both of their Doctrine
and Life, (since Pope Gregory the seventh, Innocent the third, Adrian the
fourth, Boniface 8.) has been rather Moonlight, yea Mat. 6. 22, 23.

Protestants, assert) that the Papacy opposing and exalting it self (ever since
these Popes) above all Christian Kings and Emperors, is that Man of sin, which
Christ himself shall destroy with THE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS COMING, and LIGHT of
the Gospel; I shall rather conclude, that the Pope, with his Prelates, Priests,
are the Moon, and their Church the Night; the Emperor and Christian Kings the
Sun, and their kingdoms the Day signified in Genesis 1. then Popes and
Prelates of the Church of Rome, if rightly paralleled.

The 2d. 2.
Text alleged for the Popes Supremacy over Kings and Emperors, as well in
Temporals as Spirituals, is, The 1 Samuel 10. 1. c. 15, 17. c. 16. 13. 2 Samuel 12.
7. 1 Kings 1. 35, 45. 1 Kings 11, 12. 2 C^^. 22 7.
High Priest and Priests anointed, crowned Saul, David, Solomon, Jehu, Joash,
Kings of Judah and Israel; as Popes and Bishops do Kings now: Ergo, they were
paramount their Kings, as well in Temporals as Spirituals, because they were
anointed by, and received their Crowns and Kingdoms from their hands alone; who
might dispose of them at their pleasures. Thus Pope Adrian the 4th. argued from
Popes coronations of the Roman Emperor deduced from the Jewish high Priest;
Av^ntinus Annal. Boiorum, l. 6. p. 506.
Whence has he (King Frederick) the Empire, but FROM US? By election of the
Princes he has the Name of King; by OUR CONSECRATION he has the name of
Emperor; Imperator quod habet totum habet a nobis, Whatever the Emperor has,
he has the whole from Us, It is in our Power to give the Empire to whomsoever
we will. Hence In x. Distinct. cap. Qucniam.

sundry other Pontificans, thus second Pope Adrian, Since Kings are made Kings
by their Unction; (which can be had from none BUT A PRIEST, as Saul and David
by Samuel:) It is apparent they are above above Kings, and That all Kings
receive both the Confirmation and Administration of their Kingdoms from the
Spiritual Judge, The Emperor receives his Temporal power from the Pope and
Church of Rome, who Confirms, Annoints, Crowns him; therefore approves,
rejects, and deposes him at his Pleasure.

To which I reply, 1. That Samuel anointed Saul and David to be Kings, not at,
1 Samuel 10. 1. c. 16. 1, to 1^.
but before their Coronations, and that by Gods special command, as his
Minister only, not their Superior: whence Samuel told Saul, 1 Samuel 15. 17.
The Lord anointed thee King over Israel: and David always styled him, 1 Samuel
12 19 5. c. 24. 6. 10. c. 26. 9, 11, 16, 23. 2 Samuel 1. 14, 16.
THE LORDS ANOINTED, not Samuels; refusing to offer the least violence to his
person, upon this account: So David is styled 2 Samuel 19. 21 c. 22. 51. Psalm.
18. 51.
Gods anointed, who tells him, 2 Samuel: 12. 7. 2 Kings 3. 6. 12.
I anointed thee KING over Israel; and called him, Psalm. 20. 6. Psalm 28. 8.
Psalm. 132. 17.
Mine anointed; adding, Psalm. 89. 20.
With my Holy oil have I (not Samuel) anointed him. 2. Neither Samuel, nor any
other of the High Priests who anointed Saul, David, or any King of Judah or
Israel, did ever from thence either claim or exercise the least Jurisdiction
or Superiority over their Persons, Crowns, Kingdoms, in Spiritualties or
Temporalties, as Popes and Prelates claim, exercise over Christian Kings and
Emperors, Crowned by them: Nor yet Jehojeda the High Priest, who not only
Anointed and Crowned Joash King, but was the principal Instrument in preserving
and restoring him to his Crown, when Usurped by Athaliah; But they all
dutifully submitted to, and obeyed their Royal commands, ordinances, in all
Ecclesiastic and Divine, as well as civil things, as the premises evidence.
3ly. Not only the High Priests, but 2 Chronicles. 23 Kings 11.
Elders and People anointed 2 Samuel: 2. 4. c. 5. 3. 1 Chronicles. 11.
David and 2 Kings 23. 30. 2 Chronicles. 20. 1.
Jehoahaz Kings, without any Priest or High Priest that we read of: Yet none of
them claimed, exercised any Supremacy over these Kings upon this account. 4ly.
1 Kings 1. 43, 44, 45.
Zadoc the Priest, and Nathan anointed Solomon King, by King David's special
command, not their own Authority, who put 1 Kings 1. 7. 19, 42, c: 2: 26, 27,
35.
Abiathar the chief Priest from being Priest unto the Lord, because he sided
with Adonijah, and crowned him King, and made Zadock Priest in his place. Here
the very King deposes the chief Priest, and tells him he deserved also to dye
for anointing Adonijah: not the high Priest the King, for being crowned and
anointed by Zadock. 4ly. One of the 2 Kings 9. 1, to 13.
sons of the Prophets a young man by the Prophet Elisha his command from God
(not the high Priest) anointed Jehu King, saying; Thus says the Lord, I HAVE
ANOINTED THEE KING OVER ISRAEL; which having executed, he opened the door and
fled. If this young Prophets mere anointing Jehu King, gave him an absolute
Jurisdiction over him, in spiritual and temporal things, (as these Pontificians
argue) then this Minor Prophet likewise gained the supreme Jurisdiction over
the high Priests themselves, and Zadock and Nathan over Abiathar the chief
Priest, by anointing Solomon King, as well as over Jehu and Solomon, which they
dare not aver. 5ly. Popes themselves (who pretend to this absolute Sovereign
power over Emperors, Kings, by reason they crown and anoint them) are both
elected, crowned and anointed Popes by Bishops and Cardinals only, not Popes,
as all their Platina, Onuphrius, Anastatius, Augustinus Cherubinus, Beyerlinck
and others, in their Lives; Baronius, Spondanus, Genebrardi Annals et Ch^onica.
Historians, Pontificale and Ceremoniale Romanum attest: Will Popes then
infer, Ergo they are higher, greater in Power, Jurisdiction then Popes, and
may dispose of the Papacy, Popes, and depose them at their wills? Besides in
the Ceremoniale et Pontificale My Unbishoping of Timothy and Titus, p. 84, 85,
etc.
Church of Rome, all other Episcopal Churches, and our English Church, mere
Presbyters at first, and of latter ages inferior Bishops and Clergymen both
elected, anointed, consecrated and installed all their Patriarchs,
Metropolitans, and Archbishops: Will it therefore follow, that they are
superior to Patriarchs, Metropolitans, Archbishops in Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction, and may remove them at their wills? If not, then this grand
Argument of Popes, Popelins, for the Popes, Prelates supremacy over Emperors,
Kings, Churches, kingdoms in Temporals and Spirituals, because they anointed,
crown them, is a mere ridiculous Non-sequitur. 6ly. The Sea Seldens Titles of
Honor, Pontificale Romanum, the several Histories of these kingdoms and
Archbishops of Cante^buries Lives. The 2d Part of My Signal Loyalty of Gods
true Saints, etc. to their Sovereigns, p. 14^, to 321.
Kings of England, France, Spain, Hungary, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Bohemia,
Scotland, Cyprus, and others have been usually anointed, crowned by their own
Bishops, the Kings of England most frequently by the Archbishops of Canterbury,
yet some times by the Archbishop of York, or Bishop of London, or Winchester:
Are therefore these Bishops that crown, anoint them Kings, thereby entitled to
be their Sovereign Lords in all Temporal and Spiritual things, and advanced
above all other Archbishops and Bishops in their Realms not present at their
Coronation, Consecration, and may dispose of their Bishoprics, Crowns,
kingdoms at their pleasures? If not, I hope the Roman Pontifs will from
henceforth disclaim this grand Argument for their Supremacy, as most false and
absurd. The rather because none of the Jewish high Priests, Priests ever
pretended to, much less exercised such a power over any of their most impious,
idolatrous Kings, as Popes both claimed and exercised over pious Christian
Kings, Emperors, to their eternal infamy: And because Kings are actual Kings
by desent or election, before their Coronations.

The 3d. Object. 3*
and principal warrant from the Old Testament which Popes and their Parasites
insist on for their Supreme Athority over all Christian, Pagan Kings and
Emperors Persons, Crowns, Kingdoms, to dispose, depose, root out, destroy them
at their wills; is that Text of Jeremy 1. 10. The Lord said unto Jeremiah; See,
I have this day set thee over the Nations, and over kingdoms, to root out and
to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant. Whence
they thus argue. Jeremiah the Priest, to whom this power under the Law was
given, was but a Type of the Popes, Christ's Vicar General his absolute
Dominion, power under the Gospel, of whom this Text was principally meant;
Therefore Popes may pull down, root out, destroy and throw down all Kings,
Emperors, Kingdoms at their pleasures, and dispose of them at their wills. Thus

Bellarmine, and other Romanists conclude, with very great Confidence from this
Text.

But to dismount these aspring Roman Bishops and Rooks, Answer.
I shall desire them to demonstrate; first, how Jeremiah, only one of the Jer.
1. 1, 2.
private Priests of Anathoth, not the high Priest of the Jews, was in this and
this alone, a Type of the Pope, or Peter? If not, then their pretenses,
argument are false: If yea; then let them produce some Scripture warrant for
it. 2ly. How Jeremiah and the high Priest too, from whom they claim their
power, can be both Types at once of the Pope and his Papal pretended
prerogatives? 3ly. Whether the High Priest had any such Supremacy vested in
him, as Jeremiah here received. If not, then Jeremiah was paramount him in
Jurisdiction, and might remove, extirpate him at his pleasure, as well as whole
Nations, Kingdoms, being a Member of the Israelitish Nation and Realm, and so
the High Priest not Supreme, as they formerly argued? If yea; What need of any
such special Commission from God to Jeremiah, alone; without the high Priests
privity or delegation, to the prejudice of his inherent high priesthood? 4ly.
Whether this transcendent power was given only to Jeremiah as an extraordinary
Prophet of God sanctified in, and called from the womb? or, as he was an
ordinary Priest? If as an extraordinary Prophet only, as the Text expressly
resolves; then Popes can lay no Title to it, till they can prove themselves
such extraordinary, sanctified, called Prophets, as Jeremiah, and produce the
like special divine Commission to each of them from God himself, as he
received. If as to an ordinary Priest alone; then every ordinary Priest among
the Jews heretofore had, and by like consequence every ordinary Mass Priest
in the Church of Rome has as absolute a Sovereign power over all Kings,
Emperors, Nations, Kingdoms of the world, as the high Priest or Pope himself
pretends to from this Text; and then where is his sole Monarchy over them when
equally and entirely divided amongst so many inferior Priests, or any Kings or
Kingdoms safety? 5ly. Whether it extends to Kings, there being not a word of
Kings, but only of Nations and Kingdoms, in this Text? 6ly. Whether Jeremiah by
virtue of this Commission, did either challenge or exercise any such Sovereign
Authority over Jer. 1. 1, 2, 3. 4
Amon, Jehoiakim, or Zedekiah Kings of Judah, and their kingdom, under whom he
lived; (though very wicked and idolatrous) by deposing them from their thrones,
absolving their Subjects from their allegiance, and setting up other Kings in
their steads? If not, it is infallible, then this was no Commission, See Jerome,
Theodoret, Richard de Sancto Victore, Lyra, Tostatus, Dionisius Carthusianus,
Calvin, and others in this place.
for such a rooting out, destroying, pulling and throwing down, as these
Pontificians dream of, but of far different Nature; to wit, only by denouncing
Gods judgments against them, that if they persevered in their sins, God
himself would root out, and destroy, pull and throw them down; but if they
repented upon his menaces, he would build and plant them. This God himself
declared to be his only meaning, even to Jeremiah himself and to us, chapter 19. 5.
to 11. Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying; O House of Israel, cannot
I do with you as this Potter, says the Lord? Behold as the clay is in the
Potters hand, so are ye in my hand, O house of Israel. At what instant I shall
speak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom to pluck up and pull down
and to destroy it; If that Nation against whom I have pronounced turn from
their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. And at
what instant I shall speak concerning a Nation and concerning a Kingdom, to
build and to plant it; If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice,
then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit them: Now
therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, saying; Thus says the Lord; Behold I frame evil against you, and
devise a devise against you, return ye now every one from his evil way, and
make your ways and your doings good. This way of working out, pulling down,
building up and planting Kings and kingdoms, and no other, he uses throughout
his prophecy, especially chapter 25. 17. to 38. where God commands him to take the
wine cup of his fury at his hand, and to make all the Kings and kingdoms of the
world to drink it, that so they may spue and fall and rise no more, and become
a desolation for their sins, if they repented not. This was the rooting up and
pulling down which Samuel exercised toward Saul the first King of Israel and
his kingdom; when he thus publicly menaced them, 1 Samuel: 12 24, 25.
But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be destroyed, both you and your
King. 1 Samuel 15. 23, 26. c. 13, 14, 15*
Because thou [Saul] have rejected the word of the Lord, he has also rejected
thee from being King; thou have not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God
which he commanded thee, therefore thy kingdom shall not continue, the Lord
(not I) has rent the kingdom of Israel from thee; The Lord has sought him a
man after his own heart, and the Lord has commanded him to be Captain over his
people, because thou have not kept that which the Lord commanded. This was that
rooting, up, pulling down, rending, removing of Kings, kingdoms, Nations used
by all the 2 Kings 11. to 14. See Jeremy, Ezechiel Daniel, Hosea* Nahum,
Obadiah, Amos.
Prophets and Prophecies in the Old Testament, and particularly by Gods own
denunciation against Niniveh by Jonah, Jonah 3.
Yet forty days, and Niniveh shall be destroyed; which the Kings and peoples
joint humiliation, and repentance upon his preaching, in turning from their
evil ways, prevented. 7ly. S. Bernard, when Pope Eugenius, like his
Predecessors, insisted on this Text, as giving him and them a transcendent
power, Dominion over Kings and kingdoms, returned this answer thereunto; That
it gave them no Dominion at all over their Persons, Crowns, possessions, but
only to extirpate their Vices De Consideratione ad Eugenium Papam lib. 2.
Non est quod blanditur Celsitudo; Sollicitudo major. Quale est hoc de paupere
and abjecto levari super Gentes et regna? Non ad dominandum, opinor; Nam and
Propheta cum similiter levaretur audivit, Ut evellas and destruas, and
disperdes, and dissipes, and aedifices and plants: Quid horum fastum sonat?
Rusticani magis sudoris schemate quodam labor spiritualis expressus est. Et nos
igitur ut multum sentiamus de nobis, impositum senserimus Ministerum, non
dominium datum. Non sum ego major Propheta, and si forte potestate; sed
meritorum non est comparatio. Haec loquere tibi, and doce teipsum qui alias
doces Puta te velut unum aliquem de Prophetis: An non satis ad te? et ^mium.
Sed gratia Dei es quod es. Quid? Esto quod Propheta, nunquid plus quam
propheta? Si sapis eris contentus mensura quam tibi mensus est Deus: nam quod
amplius est, a malo est: Disce exemplo Prophetico praesidere, non tam ad
imperitandum, quam ad sactitandum quod tempus requirit: disce sarculo tibi opus
esse, non sceptro, ut opus facias prophetae. Et quidem Ille, non regnaturus
ascendit, sed extirpaturus. Putas ne et tu invenias aliquid elaborandum in agro
Domini tui? Et plurimum Non plane totum quivere, emundare Prophetae aliquid
filiis suis Apostolis, quod agerent reliquerunt, aliquid ipsi Parents tui
tibi. Sed nec tu ad omne sufficiens. Aliquod profecto tuo relicturus es
Suecessori, and ille aliis, and alii aliis usque in finem. This was St.
Bernards sense of this Text, and severe check to the Pope himself for abusing
it, against the true scope and meaning.

8ly It is Gods incommunicable Prerogative which no mere mortal is
authoritativly capable of; Job 12. 16, to 22.
To loose the bond of Kings and gird them with a girdle; to lead Princes away
spoiled, overthrow the mighty, and power contempt upon Princes; Psalm. 110. 5.
Psalm: 2.
To strike through Kings in the day of his wrath, and break Kingdoms in pieces
like a Potters vessel; Ps. 149. 7, 8.
To bind Kings in chains, and Nobles in fetters of iron, for their crying
Rebellions against his Sovereign Majesty (as he did 2 Kings 5. 23 c. 25. 1. 2
Chr* 33. 11. c. 36. 6 Ezech. 19. 4, 9,
Hoshea, Zedekiah, Manasseh, Jehoiakim, others, thus bound and carried away
captive to Egypt and Babylon by their invading Kings) Dan: 2. 21. Hosea. 13.
10, 11.
He removes Kings and sets up Kings; The most high King of heaven only
rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will, and those
Kings that walk in pride against him, he is able to abate, and translate their
kingdoms to others, as he did Dan: 4. 37. 25. 32, to the c. 5* 18. to the end.
Nebuchadnezzer, and Belshazzer, who recognized this Sovereign Empire to be
peculiar to him alone. Let Popes therefore beware, how they usurp or entrench
upon this Prerogative of the most high, to the prejudice of any anointed
Christian Kings 2 Chronicles. 9. 8.
who sit upon his throne as his Viceroyes; and highest affront to the Sovereign
Jurisdiction of Christ himself, the King of Kings.

The Fourth and most colorable pretext, is from the president of Azariah the
Chief Priest and other Priests withstanding King Uzziah to burn incense upon
the altar, and thrusting him out of the Temple; (the only example in the Old
Testament of any Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction exercised by the Jewish high
Priest and Priests, on Prince or Subject) Whence Bellarmin and others conclude;
That it is Gratian cause. 11. qu. 1. cause. 23. qu. 1. cause. 15. distinct. 9.

Lawful for Popes, Bishops and Priests by their own inherent Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction to excommunicate, dethrone Kings and Emperors too, and absolve
their Subjects from their allegiance, for disobeying their Papal commands and
injunctions.

I answer 1. Answ^r.
That all this president warrants is; That Chief Priests may lawfully diswade
ambitious, wilful Kings from doing any unlawful actions against the express
will of God, and perchance resist them too when they attempt to offer
sacrifices or act ought belonging peculiarly to their own office in their own
Churches. But that they may either excommunicate, resist, or thrust them forth
of the Temple, for any other Offense, especially for violating or not obeying
their own Papal or Pontifical Orders, Injunctions, Mandares, not expressly
grounded on Gods word, this president will no ways warrant. 2ly. They did not
thrust King Uzziah out of the Temple, where he actually invaded their function
against Gods word, till God himself the King of Kings, whose Law he had
violated, had first miraculously passed sentence upon, and smitten him with the
plague of Leprosy in the forehead, which they all visibly beheld: Therefore
Popes and Priests may not thrust any King or Prince out of the Church for any
Crime, till God himself Dan: 2. 21. c. 4. 16, 17: 25, 32. c. 5. 18, to 31. Job
12. 18, 19. 1 Timothy: 6. 15. Ps. 150. 1* Ps. 149. 9, 1.
the only King and Judge of Kings) has first given visible sentence against
him by some signal Judgment. 3ly. They thus thrust him out of the Temple, not
principally because he attempted to burn incense, but because God had thus
miraculously smitten him with Leprosy in his forehead, and so by Gods express
command he was 2 Kings 15. 5 2 Chronicles. 26. 26. 21. Levit. 13, 45, 46, 5, 6.
Numb. 12. 14, 15.
to be shut out of the Congregation and Church by the Law, and dwell in a house
alone, that he might not infect others; this the Text renders to be the sole or
main cause of his thrusting out of the Temple, dwelling in a several house, and
of his Sons judging the people in his stead; not by the Priests, but his own
appointment. 4ly. This King himself when God had thus smitten him, as the Text
precisely records, hasted to go out of the Temple of his own accord,
voluntarily dwelt in a house alone, and delegated the government of his house
and people to his Son; So as there was only a voluntary expulsion of him out
of the Temple by the Priests with his own consent, not against it; but no
sequestring or deposing of him by them from his throne; he continuing King till
his death, and making his Son his Viceroy to supply his Government and order
his house. 5ly. Here was no sentence of Excommunication thundered out against
him with Bell, Book and Candle; no absolving of his Subjects from their oaths
of Allegiance, no exciting of them to rebel, or take up Arms against him to
dethrone him; Wherefore Popes and Popish Prelates can no ways justify from
this president, their excommunicating, deposing Kings, Emperors, or absolving
Subjects from their Allegiance, against their wills for the greatest crimes.

Having removed these 4. Grand Romish stumbling blocks, before, under the law
and Gospel, out of the way of my Chronological Progress, I now proceed to my
third Conclusion.

BOOK II. CHAP. III.
III. My Third Proposition is, That the Supreme Government of the Church after
Christ's Incarnation, under the Gospel, was and is vested in Jesus Christ
himself, God and Man, only as he is the King (not Priest or Prophet) thereof,
and as it is His KINGDOM. And that his Priestly and Prophetical Office are
united to his Kingly, as the first, highest in dignity, order; not his Regal to
his Prophetical or Kingly Office.
BEcause this is of very great Consequence, and may seem strange to Usurping
Pontifs, and other Prelates, who appropriate the Sovereign Spiritual
Jurisdiction Government over Christ's kingdom, Church to themselves, as united
to his Priestly and Prophetical, not Regal Office, and so derived wholly and
immediately to themselves by Christ, as Bishops, Priests; not to Kings, by,
from, and under whom they will not claim nor exercise it, as a flower of
Christ's Crown, though delegated to Kings, his sole Vice-royes upon Earth, not
Popes or Priests, who are no Kings; I shall fully demonstrate its verity by
pregnant Scripture-proofs.

1. It is generally asserted by all Divines Old and New; Pontificans and
Protestants, That King David and Solomon, (both of them 1 Samuel 16. 1, to 14. 2 Samuel 2. 4. c. 5. 3. 17. c. 12. 7. Ps. 80. 2 Kings 1. 14. 33. to 49. 1 Chronicles.
29. 22, 23, 24.
anointed by Gods special command, to sit upon Gods throns, to be Kings for the
Lord their God, (...) his people Israel, to do Justice and Judgment, to reign
over, rule (...) in the fear of God, and to establish them for ever; as
likewise to prepare, build, consecrate a most (...), and holy Temple for him
under the Law; were both lively Types of Christ; Psalm. 45. ^
(...) by God with the oil of gladness above his fellows, as the son and seed
of David, to be the Sovereign King (as God incarnate) over his Church, Saints
under the Gospel, which he redeemed, built, sanctified with his own blood,
adorned with all saving graces, and in which he should sit, rule as King and
Sovereign Lord for ever, to govern, rule, help, protect, save, glorify it for
eternity.

2ly. That Christ's coming in the flesh to rule, ^
reign in and over his People for ever, is always prophesied of, and promised
in the Old Testament, under the Title and Office of a King, not Priest or
Prophet; and that he shall sit upon the Throne of David his Father to govern
them as a King, not Priest; Witness I say 32. 1, 2. chapter 16. 5. and chapter 9. 6,
7, 8. Behold a KING shall reign in righteousness, and Princes shall rule in
Judgment: and a man shall be as an hiding place from the Wind, and a covert
from the ten post: as rivers of waters in a dry place, as the shadow of a great
rock in a weary land. And in mercy shall his Throne be established, and he
shall sit upon it in truth in the Tabernacle of David, Judging and seeking
Judgment, and hasting righteousness: For unto us a Child is born, unto us a
Son is given, and the Government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name
shall be call: Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God, the everlasting Father,
the PRINCE of Peace: Of the increase of his Government and peace there shall be
no end, upon the Throne of David, and upon his Kingdom, to order, and to
establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The
zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this. Isay 33. 22. Forth Lord is our
Judge, the Lord is our Law giver, the Lord is our King, he will save us. Jer.
23. 5, 6. The days come says the Lord, that I will raise (...) avid a
righteous branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute
Judgment and Justice in the Earth. In his days Judah shall be saved, and
Israel (...) dwell safely, and this is his name wherewith he shall be called,
the Lord our righteousness, etc. Ezekiel. 27. 22, 24, 25. And they shall be no
more two Nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at
all. And David my servant shall be King ever them, and they all shall have one
Shepherd, and they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes,
and do them. And they shall dwell in the Land which I have given unto Jacob my
servant wherein your Fathers have dwelt, and they shall dwell therein even they
and their children, and their childrens children for ever, and my servant David
shall be their Prince for ever. Hosea 3. 5. and chapter 13. 9, 10. Afterward shall
the children of Israel return and seek the Lord their God, and David their
King, and shall fear the Lord and his Good^esse in the latter days. O Israel
thou have (...) thy self, but in me is thy help; I will be thy King, where is
any other that may save thee in all thy Cities? Jer. 33. 15, 16, 17. chap. 8.
19. chapter 9, 10. In those days and at that time will I cause the branch of
righteousness to grow up unto David, and he shall execute judgment and
righteousness in the Land. In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem
shall dwell safely, and this is the name wherewith he shall be called, The Lord
our righteousness; For thus says the Lord, David shall never want a man to
sit upon the Throne of the house of Israel. Is not the Lord in Zion, is not her
King in her? The Lord is the true and living God, and an everlasting King, or
King of eternity, Micah 2. 13. Their King shall pass before them, and the Lord
on the head of them, cap. 4. 7, 8, 9. I will make her that was cast off a
strong nation, and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Sion from henceforth
for ever: Unto thee shall it come, even the first Dominion, the Kingdom shall
come to the daughter of Jerusalem. Now why do thou cry out aloud, Is there no
King in thee? Zach: 9. 9. Rejoice greatly O daughter of Sion, shout O daughter
of Jerusalem, Behold thy King comes unto thee, he is is just, having
salvation, lowly, and riding upon an Ass, and upon a Colt, the fool of an
Ass. Actualy fulfilled at Christ's triumphant riding into Jerusalem, and crying
(...) to the Son of David, blessed is the King of Israel, and blessed be the
kingdom of our Father David, John 12. 12. Mat. 21. 1* ^^, 14. Mat. 11. 1. to
12. Lu. 19. 29. to 47.
that comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest; as all the four
Evangelists record. Zech: 14. 9. 16. And the Lord shall be King over all the
earth, and in that day shall there be One Lord, and his name One. And it shall
come to pass, that every one that is left of all the Nations that came against
Jerusalem, shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of
Hosits. To which I shall subjoyn these prophecies of King David himself
concerning the Kingship and kingdom of Christ, Gods Son, of his seed. Psalm 2.
6, 7, 8. Yet have I set my King upon my holy Hill of Sion. I will declare the
Decree; the Lord has said unto me, Thou art my son, this day have I begotten
thee: Ask of me and I shall give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and
the uttermost parts of the Earth for thy possession; Thou shall break them with
a rod (or Scepter) of Iron, etc. ^salm 10. 16. The Lord is King for ever and
ever, etc. Psalm 29. 10, 11. The Lord sits King for ever: The Lord will give
strength u^ to his people, the Lord will bless his people with peace. Psalm
24. 7, 8, 9, 10. Lift up your Heads O ye Gates, and be ye lift up ye
everlasting doors, and the King of Glory shall come in; Who is this King of
Glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle, The Lord of Hosts
he is the King of Glory etc. Psalm 47. 6, 7, 8. Sing praises to God, sing
praises, sing praises unto our King, sing praises; For God is the King of all
the earth, sing ye praises with understanding. God reigns over the Heathen,
God sits upon the Throne of his Holiness. Psalm 96. 9, 10, etc. and 98. 6,
9. and 99 1, 2. O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness, fear before him
all the earth. Say among the Heathen, that the Lord reigns, the world also
shall he establish that it shall not be moved, he shall judge the world
uprightly. With trumpets and sound of a Corn it make a joyful noise before the
Lord the King, etc. For he comes to judge the earth, with righteousness shall
he judge the world, and the people with equity, More especially Psalm. 95. 3.
and 99, to 2. The Lord is a great God, and a Great King above all Gods. The
LORD REIGNS, let the people tremble: The Lord is great in Sion, and high
above all people. The KINGS strength also loves judgment, thou do establish
equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. Psalm. 149. 2. Let
Israel rejoice in him that made him, let the children of Sion be joyful in
THEIR KING: Let them praise his name in the Dance, etc. Psalm 89. 18. 34, 35,
36, etc. For the Lord is our defense, and the holy one of Israel is our King,
Also I will make him my firstborn, higher then the Kings of the earth. My
covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David, His seed
(King Jesus) shall endure for ever, and his Throne as the Sun before me, It
shall be Established for ever as the Moon and as a faithful witness in
heaven. In all these Texts of sacred Story (to omit others) Christ is still
prophesied of, and promised to his Church only, under the style of a King, Lord
or Great King of the Seed of David, sitting upon his Throne, righteously
judging and reigning over his people as a King, and he is sometimes styled
David their King (he being a Type of Christ) his Supreme government of them
being attributed, annexed only to his Kingship, not to his Priesthood or
Prophetical office, as it was in King David his Father, and the forecited kings.

3ly. That as the Scripture prophesied of, and promises Jesus Christ in the
flesh under the Title of a King; so it styles the Church and Saints he should
reign over under the Gospel, a kingdom, wherein and over which he sits and
reigns as a King for ever. This is evident by all the last recited Texts; and
those I shall add unto them. 2 Samuel: 7. 13. 29. 1 Chronicles: 28. 7. I will
establish his kingdom for ever; 1 Chr. 29. 11. Thine, O Lord, is the
greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the praise; for
all in the heaven and in the earth is thine, thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and
thou art exalted as head, above all, (as a King, not Priest or Prophet) both
riches and honor come of thee, and thou reignest overall, and in thin: hand is
Power and Might, to ^ake great and to give strength to all, Psalm. 103. 19. The
Lord has prepared his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over All: Yea
the contemplation and discourse of the Glory and excellency of Christ's
everlasting kingdom over his Church and Saints, is thus prophesied of by David,
as one principal part both of their and all other Christians duty and felicity
upon earth. Psalm: 145. 10, 11, 12, 13. All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord,
and thy Saints shall bless thee; they shall speak of the Glory of thy kingdom,
and talk of thy power, to make known to the Sons of men his mighty acts, and
the glorious majesty of his kingdom: Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and
thy dominion endures through all Generations. In pursuance of which duty, King
David himself penned two special Psalms of praise, Ps. 45. 1. My heart is
inditing a good matter, I speak of the things I have made for the King etc.
Gird thy sword (not Peter's or the Popes keys) upon thy thigh, O most mighty,
with thy glory and thy majesty; and in thy majesty ride prosperously because of
truth and meekness, etc. Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever, the Scepter
of thy kingdom (not Peter's keys) is a right Scepter. Thou love
righteousness, and hate wickedness: therefore God, thy God has anointed
thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows, Hearken (O daughter) and
consider, etc. So shall the King greatly desire thy beauty, for he is thy Lord,
and worship thou him. The King daughter ((...) the Church) is all glorious
within, etc. She shall be brought unto the King, (Christ Jesus) in raiment of
needle work, they shall enter into the Kings passage, etc. To which he adds
many Psalms of like nature, especially two begenning thus: Psalm: 97. 1 The Lord
reigns, let the earth rejoice, let the multitude of the (...) (and ours
amongst others) be glad thereof. Psalm: 99. 1. The Lord reigns, let the earth
tremble, etc. The Prophet Daniel presents us with this excellent description
and prediction of Christ's Kingdom, Dan: 2. 41. And in the days of these Kings
shall the God of heaven set up a Kingdom which shall never be destroyed, and
the Kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and
consum: all these Kingdom, and it shall stand for ever: Thus farther
illustrated Dan: 4. 3. How great are his signs? how mighty are his wonders?
and his dominion is from Generation to Generation. Upon which consideration
King Nebuchadnezzer himself upon his restoration to his understanding and
kingdom, ver. 34, 35, Blessed the most high, and praised and honored him who
lives for ever; whose dominion is an everlasting dominion and his Kingdom from
Generation to Generation: And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as
nothing, and he does according to his will, in the army of heaven, and among
the inhabitants of the earth, and who can say unto him, what do thou? King
Darius thus seconded him, Dan: 6. 26. He is the living God and steadfast for
ever, and his Kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion that
which shall be even unto the end. He delivers and rescueth, etc. Dan. 7. 13,
14, 27. I saw in the night Vision, and behold one like the son of man (Christ
Jesus) came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the ancient of days, and
they brought him near before him; and there was given him Dominion, Glory, and
a Kingdom that all people, nations and languages shall serve him; his Dominion
is an everlasting Dominion, and his Kingdom that which shall not be destroyed:
An the Kingdom and Dominion and the greatness of the Kingdom under the whole
Heaven shall be given to the people of the Saints which are of the most high;
whose Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and all Dominions shall serve and obey
him. To which the Prophet Micah superadds this prophecy, chapter 4. 7. I will make
him that was cast far off a strong Nation; and the Lord shall reign over them
in Mount Zion, from henceforth even for ever.

All these memorable Prophecies and Promises in the Old Testament, were
particularly applied to Christ and ratified by the Angel Gabriel when sent by
God to the Virgin Mary with the blessed Tidings of our Saviors miraculous
conception by the over-shaddowing of the Holy Ghost in her womb, thus recorded
by St. Luke in the New Testament, Luc. 1. 21, 31, 32, 33. Behold, thou shall
conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a Son, and shall call his name JESUS;
He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest, and the Lord
God shall give unto him, the Throne of his father David, an he shall reign over
the House of Israel for ever, and of his Kingdom there shall be no end. All
these recited memorable Prophecies, promises applied to Christ himself, his
Reign, Kingdom, Kingly Office in the New Testament, Lu. 1. 32, 33. Hebr. 1. 7.
to 14. 1 Cor. 15. 25. 2 Pet. 1. 11. infallibly resolve, That all Spiritual
Dominion, Rule; Power, Judicature and Jurisdiction over the Church and members
thereof, are actually vested in Christ by God the Father and for ever
inseparably annexed only to his Regal, not Priestly or Prophetical Office; and
that he exercises this Supreme Lordship and Dominion over them only as a King
sitting in his Regal throne, reigning over, giving Laws to, judging,
rewarding, punishing them, as they are his Kingdom, Subjects, who serve and
obey him as their King; whose Kingdom and Sovereign Dominion over them is an
everlasting Kingdom, Government, Dominion, which shall never be altered nor
destroyed, nor the rights thereof invaded by his Priestly Office, nor any
Apostle, Pope, Bishop, Priest, or Usurpers whatsoever.

4ly. Upon this account, we find these secondary Prophecies recorded in the Old
Testament, that not only all Nations, but their very Kings, Princes, Kingdoms
should obey, serve, and do him homage with all humility as their Sovereign King
and Lord, by, from, and under whom they hold their Crowns, and whose (...),
Ministers they are. Hence is that memorable prophecy of (...) David (...), on
(...) throne he is sad to sit. Psalm. 68. 24, 29. 32. They have se^n thy going O
God, the going of my God, my King, in the Sanctuary, etc. Kings ^^all bring
presents unto thee; Sing unto God ye Kingdoms of the earth, O sing praises
unto the Lord. Psalm: 72. 4, 9, 10, etc. a mere prophecy of Christ and his
Kingdom under the person o^ King Solomon his predecessor, and type; Give the
King by Judgment, O God, and thy righteousness unto the Kings Son; He shall
judge thy people with righteousness, etc. He shall have Dominion also from sea
to sea, and from the River unto the en^s of the earth; They that dwell in the
wilderness shall bow before him, and his (...) shall li^ke the dust: The Kings
of Tarshish and of the Isles shall bring presents, the Kings of Sheba and Seba
shall offer Gifts: Yea all Kings shall fall down before him, and them by their
examples and authority) all Nations shall serve him. (...) 102. 15, 16. The
heathen shall fear the name of the Lord, and (...) Kings of the earth thy glory
Psalm. 138. 4, 5. All the Kings of the Earth shall praise thee, O Lord, when
(...) hear the words of thy mouth; yea, they shall sing in the praises of the
Lord, for great is the glory of (...) Lord: Whence King David exhorting all
celestial, terrestrial, and then the rational (...) as to praise the Lord,
Psalm. 14. 8. begins thus with Kings: verse 11. Kings of the earth and all
people, Princes and all Judges of the earth, etc. Let them praise thy (...) of
the LORD, for his name alone is excellent, his glory is above the earth and
heaven. Isay 41. 1, 2. Keep silence before me O Islands, etc. who raised up the
righteus man from the east, and called him to his foot, gave the Nations before
him, and made him Rule over Kings; he gave them as dust to his sword, and as
driven s^ubble to (...). Isay 49. 7, 23. Kings shall see and arise, Princes
also shall worship, because of the Lord, that is faithful, and the holy one of
Israel. Kings and Queens shall bow down to thee, with their faces toward the
earth. Isay 52. 15. He (Christ with his (...)) shall ^^rinkle many Nations, THE
KINGS shall shut their mouths at, (or rather before) him; for that which has
not been told them shall they see, and that which they had not heard shall they
consider. Isay 60. 3. 10, 11, 16. chap. 62. 3. The Lord shall (...) upon thee,
and his glory shall be shown in thee, The Gentiles shall come to thy light, and
KINGS to the brightness of thy rising; THE KINGS of the sons of strangers
shall come unto thee; unto thee the riches of the Gentiles, and THEIR KINGS
shall be brought; The Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and ALL KINGS thy
glory.

Hence the Royal Psalmist David upon this consideration, that God in despite of
all heathen people, Kings and Rulers of the earth, should set up his Son
Jesus Christ, (...) KING upon his holy hill of Zion (which cannot be removed,
but stands fact for ever) to whom he had given the Heathen for an
Inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession; concludes
with this admonition to them, to subject themselves to his Royal Scepter and
Government: Psalm. 2. (...).
Be wise now therefore O YE KINGS, be instructed ye JUDGES of the earth; Serve
the LORD with fear, and rejoice unto him with trembling; Kiss the Son (a
Ceremony used by (...)
Subjects, f^^datories to Kings and Sovereign Lords, when they kneeled down
before and swore Homage and Fealty to become their Men and Vassals from that
day forwards of life, limb, or terrene honor; and to be true, faithful, bear
faith and true allegiance to them, continued in England till this day) lest he
be angry and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is (...): but a little;
Blessed are all they that trust in him. In all these Prophecies of Christ's
kingdom and Government under the Gospel in the Old Testament, Christ (...) and
set forth only as a KING and Sovereign Lord, reigning and (...) over his
^ubjects as a King, not as a Priest or Prophet; and his Church styled described
(...) by the Name of a Church, (never once used throughout the Old Testament)
but only of a KINGDOM, or of (...).
Mount Zion, or Jerusalem, (...).
THE CITY OF GOD, where the House of the Lord (...).
was built, his public worship settled by David and Solomon, the Metropolis of
all Kings of the seed of David, where they were crowned, reigned, and gave
Judgment, as Kings; whence it was styled (...).
THE CITY OF DAVID, for there were set THRONES OF JUDGMENT, even THE THRONES
OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID: and the CITY OF THE GREAT KING (in relation to Christ
himself) whence the Church under the Gospel (...) likewise styled, The City of
the living God, and described in all her glory, under the (...) of A CITY,
(Rev. 21. 13. to the end; and chapter 22. 1, to 27.) wherein his Subjects serve and
worship him as their LORD, GOD, KING, and shall REIGN WITH HIM FOR EVER AND
EVER; All which considered, infallibly demonstrate, the Supreme Rule and
Government of the Church on earth under the Law, to be vested only in, and
exercised by the Kings, and Sovereign Rulers of Gods people; not in and by the
High Priests or Levites; and under the Gospel in and by Christ himself only as
KING and Supreme Lord thereof, as it is his kingdom; not as a Priest or
Prophet: and that his reign, Dominion, Jurisdiction in and over it is for ever
appropriated to his Regal, not Pontifical or Prophetical office.

5ly. As the Angel told Mary a little before Christ's Conception, the Grandeur,
stability and perpetuity of his kingdom: So the Wisemen which came to Jerusalem
to worship him, being the first fruits of his Kingdom and Church under the
Gospel, inquired after him only as a King: saying, Where is he that IS BORN
KING OF THE JEWS? for we have seen his Star in the East, and are come to
worship him; Whereupon he Chief Priests and Scribes being assembled by King
Herod to inform him where Christ should be born; answered, At Bethlehem of
Judea, for thus it is written by the Prophet: And thou Bethlehem art not the
least among the PRINCES of Judah, etc. for out of thee shall come A GOVERNOR,
WHO SHALL RULE MY PEOPLE ISRAEL: where these Wisemen finding him with Mary his
mother, they fell down and worshipped (not his mother Mary with an Impera
filio, Monstra te esse matrem; Jube benedicere, etc. as Popes and their
disciples daily pray unto her even now in their Offices, Primers, Mass-books
set forth by Papal authority) but the Mat. 2. 3. 4. 5, 16. etc.
Babe, and when they had brought forth their gifts, they offered unto him Gold,
Frankincense, and Myrrh; On which place De Stella and Magis* p 265* Edit:
Pamelii.
Saint Cyprian first, and others after him, have this observation; In auro
REGEM, in thure Sacerdotem, in myrrha Incorruptibilem; quamvis pa^sibilum
demonstrat. In loco humili and supellectile vili REX Regum, and DOMINUS
Dominorum invenitur, recognoscitur, and ab aliis adoratur. And although Christ
never claimed nor exercised any temporal Authority over the Kingdom of David
(to which he was born heir, as Herod feared) but only over his Spiritual
kingdom, which he affirmed, John 18. 36. c. 19. 12. to 32.
Not to be of this world; yet he owned himself to be A KING; and John 19, 20,
21, 22. Lu 23. 37, 38. Mat. 27 37. Mar. 15 26
Pilate himself positively professed it; (though the Jews would not) by
demanding of them (when they cried out, to have him crucified) shall I crucify
your KING? and fixing this written Title on his Cross (which he would not
alter at the high Priests importunity) in Hebrew, Greek and Latin; -- JESUS OF
NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS; to evidence his Kingship (over his Kingdom the
Church) which none of the 1 Cor. 2. 8.
Princes of this world (then) knew, for had they known it, they would not have
crucified the Lord (or King) of glory; Mat. 11. 8, t^ 14. Mar. 11. 15 16, etc.
Lu. 48, etc. John 12. 1^ 14, 15, 16. c. 2. 17.
as the Apostle, and Psalmist style him:) yea the very multitude of people
proclaimed him a King, when he rode into Jerusalem in regal Triumph, Ps. 24. 7,
8, 9, 10.
by strowing their garments and bough^ of trees in the way, singing with a loud
voice; Hosanna, Blessed be the King, and kingdom of our father David that
comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest. After which he went
into the Temple, and threw out them that bought and sold therein, overthrew the
Tables of the money changers, and them that sold Doves; by virtue of his Regal,
not Sacerdotal power.

6ly. Lu. 1. 45, 4^ c. 8. 25.
It is very observable, that Jesus Christ whiles on earth, was most usually
styled both by Mat. 9. 28. ^ 13. 51. Lu. 9. 54 c. 11 1. c. 17 4. c. 24. 34.
John 13. 13. c. 14. 5^ 8, 12. Acts 16. 24.
Mary his Mother, Mat. 14. 28. 30. c. 17 4. Lu. 33, 38, 49 John 6. 68 c. 1^. 6,
9. 13, 36, 37. c. 21. 7, 12, 15, 16, 17. and 21. Acts 2. 36. c. 10 4. 14. 36.
c. 11 8. c. 12. 17. 1 Pet: 2. 13. 1 Pet. 2. 1. 3.
all his Disciples, (especially by Luke 2. 11. and infinite other Texts.
Saint Peter) and by all sorts of persons who addressed themselves unto him by
petition or otherwise, Lord, the Lord, my Lord, our Lord, and his other Titles
of Jesus, Savior, Christ, etc. are very seldom mentioned throughout the New
Testament, by Angels, Saints, Evangelists, Apostles, or any others, but with
this addition: Luke 2. 11. Phil: 2. 9, 10.
Christ the Lord, Jesus our Lord, the Lord Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior,
Lord God, etc. every tongue of Luke 12. 17. Mat: 3. 21. Mar: 5. 10, 11, 12.
Angels, Saints, yea of Mat: 7. 21. 22. c. 25. 11. Lu. 6. 46. c. 23. 25.
Devils and damned spirits, confessing, that Jesus Christ is Lord, Lord of all,
Lord and Christ, Lord both of quick and dead: which Title many John 13. 13. 14.
Hypocrites, and the foolish Virgins reiterated, saying, Lord, Lord open, etc.
Which Appellation Christ himself resolved to be true; 1 Cor. 8. 6.
You call me Lord and Master, so I am; his Father having put all things in
subjection under his feet, especially his redeemed ones, who profess this as
an Article of their faith; (r) But unto us there is but one Lord Jesus Christ,
by whom are all things, and we by him: Now this Title Lord, (attributed to
Christ in its eminentest sense) denotes only his Regal Dominion, Lordship, and
Sovereignty over them in and under the Gospel as their KING, as the penitent
Theefs speech to him on the Cross, Luke 23. 42.
LORD remember me when thou come into THY KINGDOM; the Apostles question to
him, Acts 1. 6.
LORD will thou at this time restore the KINGDOM to Israel? Saints Paul's
conclusion, 2 Timothy 4. 18.
THE LORD will preserve me to his HEAVENLY KINGDOM, with St Peter's, 2 Pet. 1.
11.
For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into THE EVERLASTING
KINGDOM OF OUR LORD and Savior Jesus Christ, and our Saviors own
asseverations, Mat. 7. 21. c. 21, 22.
Not every one that says LORD, LORD, shall enter into the KINGDOM OF HEAVEN,
but he that does the will of my father which is in heaven, necessarily evince.

7ly. After our Saviors resurrection and ascension; when God his Father highly
exalted him, and gave him Mat: 28. 18.
all power both in heaven and earth, his Sovereign Regality and Dominion in and
over his Church and Kingdom, are frequently set forth in these transcendent
expressions decyphering only his Regal, not Prie^tly or Prophetic Offices and
Administrations; 1 Timothy: 6. 14, 15. Rev: 1. 5. c. 17. 14. c. 19. 16.
Our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord
of Lords, the Prince of the Kings of the earth; whom God the father of glory
has set at his own right hand in heavenly places, far above all principalities
and powers, and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in
this world, but in the world to come, and has Ephesians: 1. 18, 19.
put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to his
Church, which is his body: Col. 1. 10, to 20.
The fulness of him that fills all in all; Goa has (by the extraordinary
greatness of his mighty and glorious power delivered us from the power of
darkness and translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son, who is the
firstborn of every creature; For by him were all things created that are in
heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones,
or dominions, or principalities or powers, all things were created by him and
for him. And he is the head of the body the Church, who is the beginning, the
firstborn from the dead, that in (or among^^) all things he might have the
preeminence: For it pleased the Father that in him all fulness should dwell:
Compared with his other Gospel titles, Thou Rev. 15. 3.
King of Saints, and the united praises, Rev: 4. 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, c. 5. 11, 12,
13, 14, c. 19. 4. Romans 17. 36.
prostrations, acclamations, of the Angels, with the four beasts, and the 24.
Elders, and all the Saints and Redeemed ones before Christ who sits on the
throne, before whom they all fall, worship, and cast down their Crowns, saying,
Worship and honor, and thanks and glory, and power be unto him that sits
upon the throne for ever and ever; worthy art thou O LORD to receive glory and
honor; for thou have created all things, and for thy pleasure they were and
are created: All these recited Texts resolve, that Christ is Supreme head of
his Kingdom the Church, not in his Priestly, Prophetical capacity or office,
but only in his Regal, and reigns in it as a King, Lord, not as Priest or
Prophet.

8ly. As in the Old so in the New Testament, the Church Militant as well as the
Triumphant, is usually styled Mat: 6. 33. c. 21. 42, 43. Mat: 10. 14.
the Kingdom of God, the Mat. 3 2. c. 4. 12: c. 5. 19. c. 10. 11, 12. c. 18.

ever in his Church as a King on a Royal throne, clothed with royal Majesty and
glory; His rewards are all Regal; A crown of righteousness, of glory, thrones,
Inheritances in his kingdom, reigning with him as Kings, royal Robes, Honor,
Glory. His punishments Regal; Exclusion from his kingdom, everlasting death,
infernal chains, destruction from the presence of the LORD, and from the Glory
of his POWER, His judging of quick and dead at his appearance and coming; Yea
all his administrations Regal, in prescribing Laws to his Church, rescuing
them from the power of Satan, Hell, and all other Enemies; protecting them from
all evils; treading Satan under their feet; Guarding them by his Mighty power
unto salvation in his heavenly kingdom: compared with this fulfilling of the
procies Mat: 13 38. 1 Timothy: 4, 8: Jam: 1. 12: 1 Pet: 5: 4: Rev: 2: 10:

of Christ's kingdom in the Old Testament, thus recorded (as accomplished) in in
the New; Rev: 11. 15. There were great voices in heaven, saying, The Kingdoms
of this world are become the Kingdom (not Church) of our Lord and of his
Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever. Rev: 12. 10. And I heard a loud
voice saying in heaven, Now is come the Kingdom of our God, and the Power of
his Christ. 1 Cor: 15. 24, 25. Then comes the end, when Christ shall have
delivered up the Kingdom to God the Father, when he shall have put down all
rule, and all authority and power; for he must reign till he shall put down all
enemies under his feet. All and every of these Texts and considerations jointly
and several demonstrate more clearly then the Morning Sun; That Christ's
Government of his Kingdom the Church under the Gospel, is only Kingly and
Monarchical, (as even De Romano Pontif. l. 5. c. 1. See Dr: Crakenthorp of the
Popes Temporal Monarchy, c. 1. Alvarus Pelagius De Planctu Eccles. l. 1. Art:
13. Gratian Did. 15, 22, 69, 96.
Bellarmin himself, and most Pontificians profess, argue; grounding the Popes
Universal Monarchy upon it) not Pontifical or Prophetical; and that the Supreme
Government thereof is for ever entirely annexed to his Regal, not Priestly or
Prophetical Office; and these Offices of his united to his Regal Office as
Supreme, not his Regal to his Sacerdotal or Prophetical, as subordinate to
them.

This being an unfallible Gospel Truth, not hitherto so fully cleared, and
insisted on by the Oppugners or Asserters of Popes Universal Monarchy, as was
necessary, which induced me to expatiate in its probation. The second and sole
Question will be; Whether Christ himself did ever delegate by any Commission
recorded in Sacred History all his Regal Power and Jurisdiction, or any branch
thereof, to Saint Peter, or any other Apostles, Bishops, Presbyters,
Evangelists, or Ministers of the Gospel? Or whether they or any of them ever
justly claimed, enjoyed, exercised this his Royal Dominion, Office, Government
in or over his Church on earth? If yea; as most Popes and their Parasites
confidently affirm, (without the least shadow of Scripture or Verity;) let them
produce the Commission or Texts, to evidence it to every man's 2 Cor. 4. ^.
conscience in the sight of God, and to all Kings, Kingdoms, Nations in the
world: If not (as shall be evidenced in the ensuing Chapters past all
contradiction;) I and they may then safely cry out mightily with a strong
voice, as the Angel prophetically does; Rev. 18, 2, 3 4, 21.
Babylon the great (Rome) is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of
Devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and
hateful Bird: Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins,
and that ye receive not of her Plagues: with violence shall she (and her
triple-crown'd Pontif) be thrown down (from the pinnacle of her usurped,
super-transcendent power) and shall be found no more at all.

Before I take leave of this Proposition, to avoid mistakes, and clear up the
Truth, it will be necessary to distinguish: 1. The several sorts of Christ's
kingdoms. 2ly. What kind of Kingdom his Church is. 3ly. How and in what manner
he reigns and governs in it, as King and Sovereign Lord over it?

For the 1. It is See Augustine De Civit: Dei, l. 20. c. 9. l. 7. c. 7 etc.
Homil: in Johan: 115. Bucerus de Regno Christi, Dr Crakenthorp of the Popes
Tem^^ral Monarchy c. 2, 3. Bellarmin. de Pontif. Romans l. 5. c. 4.
generally agreed by Fathers, Pontificians and Protestants, that Jesus Christ
has a threefold kingdom, set forth in the premised Scriptures, if strictly
pryed into. The first is, a Kingdom of power, and absolute Dominion, which
extends it self not only to all Men and Angels, but Psalm. 103. 19. 21, 22, 23.
Ps. 145. 9, 10, 11, 12. Ps: 148. 1. to 14. Ps. 135. 5, 6, 7. Ps. 9. 4. 3, 4, 5,
6. Phil: 2. 15, 16. Rom: 51. 36. Col. 1. 16, 17, 18. Rev. 4. 10. c. 11, 13.
John 1. 1, 2.
likewise to all other unreasonable and inanimate Creatures whatsoever in
heaven, earth, and under the earth, yea to the very Devils themselves; This
Kingdom belongs unto Christ principally as he is God, and the Creator of all
things, which comes not within the Verge of our present Discourse; however
Popes seem to usurp it. The 2. is a Kingdom of Rev: 5. 9, 10. c: 3, 4, to 17.
c. 14, to 6. c. 15. 47. c: 2* 15. Mar: 6: 10. 13.
mere purchase, or Grace, confined properly not to Angels or Mankind in
general; but to such as are truly elected, called, justified, sanctified,
redeemed, saved by Christ's precious blood; yet in the largest sense extended to
the good Angels, and all visible Members of the Church Militant professing the
name and gospel of Christ, as his Subjects; though not actually regenerated,
justified, sanctified, saved: Of this Kingdom there are two distinct parts: the
one Triumphant in Heaven: over which no Pope or Mortals on earth can pretend
the least Kingship or Dominion; the other Militant upon Earth; the latter in
its largest extension comprehending all who bear the name of Christians,
whether good or bad, regenerate or unregenerate: This is the Kingdom of Christ
of which the Pope as Christ's Vicar General, and Peter's fictitious Successor
pretends himself the Supreme and sole Governor. The 3d. is the Kingdom 1 Cor:
15. 24. etc. Mat: 25. 31, to 46. c. 13. 43. c. 24. 30, 31. Jam. 2. 5.
of Glory, not really different from the former, long since begun, and
increasing every day more and more, by new additions of departed Saints
thereto, which kingdom shall be fully completed, when all the Elect shall be
gathered, the Church militant united to the Church triumphant and actually
glorified with Christ in the kingdom of heaven.

For the 2d. It is asserted by Fathers, and most ^^han de (...) de Potest:
(...) c. ^.
Romanists themselves, as well as See Dr: Rainolds and others, on Psalm: 11^.
Bp. Jewels Defense, part 6. p. 713.
Protestants, that this Kingdom of Christ is merely Spiritual, Not any temporal
kingdom upon earth, as the Jews, some gross Milenaries, Popes and their
Parasites fancy; over which Christ never actually reigned, or shall reign as a
Temporal King and Lord, even in all temporal things; for which we find no
warrant in Scripture or Fathers. Hence Thomas Doctrinalis Fidei, Tom: 1. l. 2.
Art. c: 3. c. 76, 77.
Waldensis himself (though a grand Advocate for the Popes Supremacy) lays down
and proves at large these 4: Conclusions, 1. Regnum temporale Judaeorum sub
Jeconio excidium accepit, neque amplius Judaecorum aliquis, vel de jure, vel de
facto illud obtinuit 2. Regnum illud Judaeorum terrenum, cum figura fuit Regni
aeterni, and spiritualis Christi debuit omnino in adventu eius cessare,
quemadmodum et sacrificia. 3. Regnum temporale quod in Prophetarum scriptis,
MESSIAE promissum est, non est Regnum Carnale et Terrenum, sed Spirituale, quo
per Fidem in Cordibus suorum Regnat. 4. Quod ex verbis quae Christus dixit
coram Pilato (Tu dicis quod Rex sum ego) non potest colligi, quod ipse fuerit
Rex Terrenus de Facto vel de Jure. And Genesis 49. 10. proves, That the temporal
Scepter should depart from Judah, when Christ the true Shiloh came into the
world.

Alvarus Pelagius (the De Planctu Eccles: l. 1. Art. 10. to 68.
grand assertor of the Popes Universal Kingship in and over Christ's kingdom the
Church, and all earthly Kings, Kingdoms too) informs us; That the Lib: 1. Art:
c: 61.
kingdom of Christ has various acceptations in Scripture; 1. It is taken for
Christ himself. 2ly. For the sacred Scripture, or Gospel of Christ. 3ly. For
the Church of Christ, divided into two Parts: Militant on earth, triumphant in
heaven: yet there are not two kingdoms in the Church, but one kingdom; because
both end in one, and there is but one King of both, and one Spirit reigns in
both Churches, but diversely; for in the Church of Travelers it reigns by
faith, in the Church of the blessed by open vision. This Church therefore is
but One for the unity of its end and beginning, but it is distinguished by
reason of the diversity of the state: Yet this kingdom comprehends, not only
the Elect, but also all the holy Angels, for there is but one City and Kingdom
of God constituted out of holy Angels and men; as he proves out of Augustine,
and Gratian Distinct: 10. and 59. That Christ ever challenged or enjoyed any
temporal kingdom upon earth, he offers not the least proof out of Scripture or
Fathers; in which De Pontifice Romano l. 5. c. 4, and Recognitio ejusdem, p.
33, 35.
Cardinal Bellarmin himself confesses, he could never find that Christ had any
such kingdom after most diligent search, but only a kingdom in and over his
Church, which is not temporal but spiritual.

For the 3d. All ancient, and most modern Divines of all sorts assert, that
Christ's immediate Government in and over his Spiritual Kingdom the Church, is
Spiritual not Temporal; and that principally Ephesians0 3. 16, 17. Gal: 2. 20. 2 Timothy: 1. 14. Rom: 8. 1. c. 5. 17. 21. 1 Cor: 3 16. Rev: 19. 6, 7. Lu: 13. 14,
27. Col: 3. 15. Bucerus De Regno Christi. Dr. Rainolds on Psalm. 110.
in and over the souls, spirits, consciences, wills, hearts, affections of his
elect Saints, in which he dwells, lives, rules, reigns by his Spirit, and
Grace. And this his Spiritual Government is neither communicated, nor
transferred by Jesus Christ to any King, High Priest, Priest, Bishop, Pope, or
other Mortal whatsoever; but resides in Christ alone the King of Saints; as an
incommunicable, unseparable part and prerogative of his Regal, not Sacerdotal
or prophetical office. But more of this in the two next Propositions.

BOOK I. CHAP. IV.
That Jesus Christ as Supreme King, Lord, Head of his Kingdom the Church,
whiles on Earth never claimed, exercised, enjoyed any Temporal Royal
Jurisdiction, or Magistratical Authority over any of his Subjects, much less
over Emperors, Kings, Kingdoms, Nations, or Sovereign civil Powers, nor ever
deprived any of them of their Crowns, nor absolved their Subjects from their
Allegiance, nor pulled up, cast down, or rooted up their Kingdoms, nor gave
them to whomsoever he pleased: Neither did he either before, at, or after his
passion, resurrection or ascension, derive any such superlative Power to Saint
Peter, as his sole universal Vicar or Viceroy, nor to any other Apostle,
Bishop, Priest, or Pope whatsoever. Nor delegate his Supreme Spiritual
Jurisdiction over his Kingdom the Church militant in this world, and all the
Members of it; but only committed to them the Ministerial part of his
Prophetical Office (his Psalm: 110. Heb: c. 6. 7, 9, to 7. 19. to 28* c. 8. 1.
to 13. c. 9. c. 9. 17. to the end, c. 10, 1. to 24. See Dr. James, David

High Priestood being personal, untransferrable and incommunicable unto any
other) of teaching and preaching the Gospel publicly to all Nations,
administering the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords Supper to them according
to his institution and command; feeding them as his Sheep with the sincere milk
of his word; teaching them (as his Apostles, Ministers, Servants) to obey
whatever he has commanded them; beseeching, entreating them as his
Ambassadors, in his stead to be reconciled unto God; and to declare, pronounce
them absolved from their sins by God upon their sincere repentance; and to
denounce damnation against them in case they repented not, and believed not in
Christ.
I Have here enlarged this Proposition, (abridged in my Prologue) the clearing
whereof will prove fatal to St. Peter's and the Popes pretended Universal, Regal
Supremacy, and Pontifical Jurisdiction over Kings, Emperors, Kingdoms, Nations,
as well in temporals as spirituals, and over Christ's Kingdom, (the Church
Militant on Earth) as Christ's sole Viceroy, or Vicar General, to whom all his
Regal and Sacerdotal power in heaven and earth, is assigned by Christ himself,
if we believe their own Papal or their Parasites claims; which I shall here
pre^^ise in their own words, that so their Antichristian Usurpations,
Blaspemies, Impostures may more visibly appear to all Christian Kings, and the
whole world, who cannot but abominate and be jealous of them, though never so
much devoted to the Papacy.

Gratian Distinct: 22, cap. Omne^ p. 33.
Pope Nicholas the 2d. writes thus to those of Millain (who refused to obey the Sea of Rome, Anno 1060.
and acknowledge the Popes Universal Supremacy) Christ alone has founded,
built the Roman Church upon the rock of the faith newly born, and has
committed to Saint Peter, the Key-bearer of eternal life, TERRENI SIMUL and
IMPERII CAELESTIS JURA: the Rights both of the earthly and heavenly Empire:
Therefore not any terrene Sentence; but that word by which heaven and earth
were built, by which faculty all the Elements were made, has founded the Roman
Church: Certainly she enjoys her privileges from him by whom she is
supported. Therefore IT IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED, that he who endeavors to take
away from the Church of Rome, the Privilege granted her by the very chief head
of all Churches, HIC PROCVLDUBIO IN HAERESIN LABITUR; HIC EST DICENDVS
HAERETICVS; He without doubt falls into Heresy; he is to be called an
heretic, because he violates the faith, who acts against her who is the mother
of faith, and is found contumacious to him, who is known to have advanced her
above all Churches. On which Text Bartholomeus Buxiensis, and Ioannes Thierry,
make this Gloss; Papa habet utrumque gladium, scilicet, Spiritualem and
Temporalem, and transtulit Imperium.

The Pope (as De Potestate Ecclesiae lib: 3. art: 3. qu: 1: in Principio Summae

Augustinus Triumphans asserts) is greater then any King or Emperor, as well in
Temporal as in Spiritual Matters; and as God is the Lord of all by Universal
Jurisdiction, so is the Pope, his Vicar, greater then any King or Emperor both
in spiritual and temporal things. The power of Jurisdiction in temporal and in
spiritual matters is immediate in the Pope alone. Yea, the Son of God has
declared the altitude of Ecclesiastical power (in the Pope) to be above all
principalities and powers, that unto it every knee should bow both in heaven,
in earth, and under the earth.

Ralulphus Cupers impudently proclaims, God has committed to the Pope the
rights both of the terrene and heavenly kingdoms. The direct dominion of the
Emperor belong unto God, and by consequence to the Pope his Vicar, who is
deservedly accounted the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, The Lord has so
magnified the Church (which he expounds to be the Pope) that he has preferred
it not only to Kings and Cesars, sed omnibus sub coelo and supra coelum
existentibus; but to all that are either under Heaven or above Heaven.

Bellarmin himself informs us; That the Pope, Jure divino, has power over the
whole world as well in temporal as in Ecclesiastical matters, is also taught by
Augustinus Triumphans, Alvarus Pelagius, Hostiensis, Panormitan, Silvester; and
diverse others; Yea Hostiensis teaches; That Christ by his coming translated
all the Dominion, even that of Infidel Princes, unto the Church, and that this
Dominion so resides now in the Pope Christ's Vicar, That he may give by his own
Right the Kingdoms of Infidels (as well as Christians) to whomsoever he will.

Alvarus Pelagius seconds all these with most Hyperbolical passages and
blasphemies, which I cannot pretermit: Christ ( De Planctu Ecclesiae. l. 1.
art. 19.
writes he) had all power given unto him both in Heaven and Earth, and being
ascended in his humanity to his Father; lest he should leave his flock without
a Shepherd, he left the care thereof to Peter and his Successors, as his Vicar
General: Now the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty, even in Earth: Therefore
every Pope his Vicar upon Earth, has all power in Earth which Christ had, not
as very God, but as very Man. To this purpose is that which Zacharias says of
Christ, Zech. 8. His power shall be from Sea to Sea; And Ps. 72. 8. He shall
have dominion from Sea to Sea, and from the River unto the ends of the Earth:
Whence Ecclesiasticus speaking of the power of the Pope, says, Eccles. 17. God
has given him power of those who are upon the Earth: For in this the Pope is
Successor to Adam, the first man, for God the Son has autonomatically and
typically formed the Pope (his Vicar) after his own image and likeness, Genesis
1. For the Pope truly represents Christ on Earth, so that he who sees the Pope
with a contemplative and faithful eye, may see even Christ himself: Whence
even for this cause he said to Peter, Mat. 18. Thou art Peter, taken a Rock
from me: Distinct: 21. and 1. Hunc enim in consortium individuae Trinitate
assumptum, id quod ipse erat, etc. For Peter being assumed into the Fellowship
of the individual Trinity, is become that which (Christ) himself was: that is
from that which he was, namely a Rock; the Lord would have him to be called and
named Peter: Whence according to this, Papa non est homo simpliciter, sed Deus,
id est, Dei Vicarius: Whence according to this, the Pope is not simply a Man,
but a God: that is, The Vicar of God. Item, Christ as a man was a King, Zach:
9. Mat: 21, and 27. Lu: 24. John 19. Psalm: 72. Romans 2. and 7. God shall raise
up a Kingdom, etc. But of this universal Kingdom the Emperor is not Christ's
Vicar, because there are not two Vicars, as is plainly proved; Therefore the
Pope is his Vicar, because there is no other Vicar, and the Kingdom of the
world, is not without the Vicar of God. He thence inferrs and asserts in
another Article, Ibid. l. 1. artic. 34.
Although in this life the Pope should do injury or injustice to any man, or
some men, (as he confesses he may) he has no Judge over him; neither is he
obliged to choose Judges or arbitrators, to whose Sentence he may subject
himself, neither can he directly or indirectly be condemned; for it is
impossible that the Pope himself should constitute another Superior Prince, or
Judge, or another ArchPope above or equal to himself, sicut nec Deus Trinitas
possit super se alium Deum constituere vel aequalem; as neither God the Trinity
can constitute another God above or equal to himself: He thus proceeds in
another Article; Lib: 1. Artic: 3^.
The Church (or Pope) are not from the Empire, but the Empire from the Church;
and the Pope is before the Emperor, which he endeavors to prove by 25.
Arguments: I shall only touch upon some of them. As the Moon receives her
dignity and her Light from the Sun: so does the Moon, the Emperor, the
dignity of his altitude from the Sun the Pope. As much as the spiritual life
is worthier then the earthly; the spirit then the body, gold more precious then
silver: so much does the spiritual power exceed the temporal or secular power,
in dignity, honor, worth, splendour, and the order of Priests is so much higher
then the Regal power, to which all Emperors and Kings ought to subject
themselves, every of them being subject suo simplici Sacerdoti qui ipsum
solvit, ligat and judicat. All power in earth, both spiritual and temporal is
given to the Pope Christ's Vicar, as it was to Christ himself, Mat: 28. for in
him resides the fullness of the Regal or Imperial Dignity, that is, to take
from one and conferr unto another the right of choosing the Emperor; to examine,
anoint, consecrate and crown him when elected, and by consequence to approve
and reject him; all which of right belong to the Pope. That the Pope out of the
plenitude of the power and keys given to him by Christ, with this Commission,
Feed my Sheep, has a power and jurisdiction over all men upon earth de jure,
although not de facto; which he may exercise when ever he is able, or willing;
by which power he may lawfully punish all Pagan, Heathenish Kings, Nations, and
Idolaters in the world, as well as Christians for breach of the Law of Nature
only, and command all Infidels who are subject to his Jurisdiction in earthly
things, to admit the preachers of the Gospel, and punish them if they do not
obey him; yea, the Pope alone and none other of right, can contend with, and
denounce war, and invoke the secular power against them. Christ was a true
temporal King, and by consequence the Pope his Vicar. He that in this point
will exclude from himself the darkness of understanding, must consider the
Pope, non hominem, sed Deum quodammodo qui non puri hominis, sed Very Dei vicem
gerit in terris. As Christ is God and Man, most perfectly participating both
Natures, and God and Man are both one Christ, perfect God and perfect Man: So
his Vicar General and Singular, the POPE: (participat cum Christo quodammodo
naturam Divinitatis quoad Spiritualia; and humanitatis quoad temporalia,)
participates with Christ after a sort the Nature of the Divinity as to
Spiritualities; and of the Humanity as to Temporalties. As by force of the
Orthodox faith it is heretical to lay down two Beginnings, 24. Quaest: So it
seems to be heretical, to make two several Vicars equals to each other in earth
in point of right. As therefore no believer doubts Jesus Christ was both King
and Priest, and King of heaven and earth, because all things were made by him
(one person in two Natures) So no Catholic ought to doubt but his Chief Vicar
General on Earth has likewise both Powers; Yea it would not be far from
Heresy pertinaciously to affirm the contrary; because this would be as it were
to deny the Son of God to be the Maker of the Earth and a King, and so to make
Duo principia, That therefore thou may not seem an Arch Heretic, let this be
thy Catholic Faith, that as there is but one God incommutable: so there is but
one his Vicar General upon Earth: Cui omnes Angeli, i. homines, debent esse
subjecti, and in omnibus obedire; to whom all Angels; that is, Men, ought to be
subject, and to obey in all things; whose Ship is stable and immutable: For
thus the inferior Hierarchy accords with the superior when all men serve and
obey his Vicar in earth, as all Angels serve and obey God in heaven: but when
they grow proud and resist, the inferior is disturbed, and the superior
Hierarch is offended. Gratian cause. x. qu. 3. All things are put under the

article he asserts, That the Pope is King of Kings, of the Emperor and
Spiritual Kings, and every Member of the Church Militant, who ought Iure Divino
to be subject to him: That he has a plentitude of all Temporal and Spiritual
power in him in several respects. 1. Because it is a universal power; No person
in the Militant Church (nor Infidel in some sense) being exempted from, but
subject to it. 2ly. Because all temporal and spiritual power whatsoever
ordained by God for the government of christians or men, is comprehended in his
power. 3ly. Because all power in the Church is derived from his, and ordained
for it: and he is the beginning and end of any power whatsoever; Therefore
every human power is DE JURE subject to him. 4ly. Because it is not exceeded,
nor overcome by any other human power, but overcomes and exceeds all other
powers. 5ly. Because it is limited, or ordained, or judged by no other power;
but it limiteth, ordains, judges all other powers. 6ly. Because it is not
restrained, nor bound by any Laws made by the Pope himself; for it may act
mediately by other powers, or immediately by it self whatsoever it shall think
sit. It may likewise act both according to the Laws it sets down, and besides
them when it shall judge convenient. And for this cause his Power is said to
be, Sine Numero, Pondere et Mensura. Without number, because it extends to
innumerable persons even all men in the world, whether Believers or Infidels.
Without weight, because it is not confined to one place, but extends it self to
all Churches throughout the world. And without measure, as to the act and
manner of acting; because it is after a sort Immense both in acting, and in the
manner of acting; For, as the Spirit was given to Christ man without measure,
John 3. and to others it is given only according to the measure of the gift of
Christ, 1 Cor: 12. Ephesians. 4. Rom: 12. So to Christ's Vicar, the Pope, is given a
Power without measure, to wit, in a certain Immensity, Ex^rav: de Major, and
Obedientia Solita, c. Nos autem. But to others is given a power according to
their measure of participation of this Immense Power: And although this Power
of Christ's Vicar is without Number, Weight or Measure, yet notwithstanding it
determinates to other powers, Number, Weight and Measure, Causa xv. qu. 1.
pervenit. 13. qu. 1. c. 1. Therefore this power is deservedly called FULL,
proper quod multum veneranda and metuenda est, wherefore it is much to be
Reverenced and Feared. And indeed all Kings, Princes, Kingdoms, Churches of the
World had need to fear, yea to keep watch and ward against it, and for ever to
abandon it, as our and other Kings, Kingdoms, Churches have both justly and
prudently done, and more are now about to do: For, Baldus. Bp. Jewels Defense

Pope Gregory the 7. (that impious Hildebrand and pest of the world in his
generation) in his ratification of the Emperor Henry the seconds
Excommunication, presumed to make this most impious Antichristian appeal to
Peter and Paul themselves: Go to now, O ye blessed Apostles, do you confirm
what I have done, that all men may know, that if you being in heaven can bind
and loose, that I also here on Earth can give and take away Empires, Kingdoms,
Principalities, and quicquid habere mortales possunt; and what ever Mortals can
possess. And two of his late Successors (new-named Paul when crowned Popes)
with their Parasites are of the same judgment with their predecessors;
point blank against Saint Paul's doctrine, evidencing them to be the very
Antichrist; and man of Sin decyphered by him 2 Thessalonians. 2. which they
demonstrated by their two late Portraitures cut, and printed in Brasse-pieces,
prefixed to two Books dedicated to them, printed in Italy it self Permissu

Bononiae 1608. and Caraffae Theses, Neapoli 1609. in one of which (as the Noble
Lord My (...).
Morney observes) Pope Paul the 3d, is Pourrayed with this blasphemous
Inscription: Paulo 3. Opt. Max. in terris Deo: And in the other Pope Paul the
V. with this Motto, Paulo V. Vicedeo, Christianae Reipublicae Monarchae
Invictissimo, et Pontificiae Omnipotentiae Conservatori acerrimo; In both which
Pourtraitures under their respective Papal feet, the Scepters, Crowns of Kings
and Emperors are prostrated, and Princes, Kings, Emperors themselves stand
pourtrayed by them bare-headed, excommunicated, astonished, and adoring these
Pontifs; One of them having this inscription over his head, Vultu Imperium
portendit: Besides, these sacred Texts are engraven round about them, Jer: 27.
(intended only of King Nebuchadnezzer, the great subverter, persecuter of Gods
Church, Kings, Kingdoms, whom the Pope it seems will now succeed as his Vicar
General, rather then Christ's) That Nation and Kingdom which will not serve him,
will I punish, says the Lord, with the sword, and with the pestilence, until
I have consumed them by his hand, Dan: 7. 14. The Lord has given to him Power
and a kingdom, and all people shall serve him; his power is an everlasting
power which shall not be taken away, and his Kingdom that which shall not be
destroyed. Isay 49. 23. Kings and Queens shall bow down to thee with their
faces toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet. The two last texts
pertain to Christ alone, as King of his Church.

You have seen a pretty full View of Popes and their parasites blasphemous
claims of an unlimited Universal Supremacy in all causes and over all persons
whatsoever throughout the world, yea over the Persons, Crowns, Scepters,
Kingdoms, Empires of all Kings, Princes, Emperors, vested in Christ's pretended
Vicar General, and S. Peter's Successors the Pope; enough to awaken, alarm all
Monarchs, Realms, Churches throughout the Universe, as well Papal as Pagan, to
keep watch and ward against, and for ever to exterminate such Antichristian,
Antimonarchical Usurpers out of their Dominions, as all Protestant Kingdoms,
Churches have done upon very good grounds, without the least guilt of Sir Roger
Twisden his late learned Historical Vindication of the Church of England in
point of Scisme. London 1663.
Schism, wherewith they maliciously brand them: I shall now proceed to
evidence the truth of my forecited Proposition, which will for ever dissipate,
and overturn these their presumptuous groundless Claims and Titles to their
forecited temporal and spiritual Universal Sovereignty.

The first Part thereof; That Jesus Christ as Supreme King, Lord, Head of his
kingdom the Church, whiles on earth, never claimed nor exercised any Temporal,
Regal Jurisdiction over Kings, or other Civil Magistrates or their Subjects:
much less deprived them of their Crowns, Kingdoms, Prerogatives; nor ever gave
unto St. Peter, or to any other Apostle, the least Dominion over them,
(especially such as Popes now claim) but both he and they submitted themselves
to, and ratified, asserted, (not invaded) their Supremacy and Regal Power in
the highest degree; I shall thus invincibly demonstrate.

1. Jesus Christ himself though (as many assert) he had a temporal right to the
temporal Crown and Kingdom of the Jews, as right heir thereto of the seed of
King David; and therefore was thus inquired after by the Wise men; Mat 2. 1, 2,
3.
Where is He that is Born King of the Jews? Yet it is observable First, That he
never claimed, nor seized on his earthly Kingdom then usurped by King Herod,
who sought to murder him, to secure himself against Christ's Title, nor ever
exercised the least Temporal, Royal Jurisdiction therein. 2ly. That (on the
contrary) John 6. 15.
when he perceived the people would come and take and make him KING by force,
he departed from them into a Mountain alone, to prevent their designs. 3ly.
That When he was arraigned before Pilate, and accused as Joan 18. 16. c. 19.
an Enemy to Caesar, because he made himself A KING; He twice openly professed
in one breath; My Kingdom is not of this World, If my Kingdom were of this
world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered unto the
Jews; But now is my kingdom not from hence. And in his prayer to his Father for
his Disciples, (a little before his passion) he said, John 17. 16.
They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world: Therefore doubtless
since, he neither challenged nor exercised any Temporal dominion as a King in
his own proper Kingdom of Judea: much less took he away the Diadems, Crowns,
Realms, Sovereignty of any other Kings, Princes, nor exercised any Regal
Jurisdiction in them. This the ancient Christian Poet Hymno Acrostico de Vita
Christi, Bellarmin: l. 5. i De Romano Poniifice, c. 3. Breviarum Romanum.
Prudentius professed in his Hymn of Christ, sung in the very Church of Rome
till this day, where he thus expostulates with Herod for fearing Christ would
deprive him of his crown, and murdering the innocent children upon that very
account: Herodes hostis impie, Christum venire quid times?
NON ERIPIT MORTALIA, QUI REGNA DAT COELESTIA.
Why wicked Herod do thou fear, And at Christ's coming frown?
The Mortal he takes not away, That gives the Heavenly crown.
Which Collect. l. 2. in Mat. Bp. Usher of the Religion professed by the
Ancient Irish, p. 130, 131.
Claudian an ancient Author in his Collectanea upon Matthew thus elegantly
seconds; That KING which is born, does not come to overcome Kings by fighting,
but to subdue them after a wonderful manner, by dying; neither is he born to
the end that he may suceed thee, but that the World may faithfully believe in
him: For he is come not that he may fight being alive, but that he may triumph
being slain; Nor that he may with Gold get an Army to himself out of other
Nations, but that he may shed his precious blood for the saving of the Nations.
Vainly did thou by envying fear him to be thy Successor, whom by believing
thou ought to seek as thy Savior; because if thou did believe in him,
thou should reign with him: and as thou have received a Temporal Kingdom
from him, thou should also receive from him an Evelasting. For the Kingdom
of this Child is not of this World, but by him it is that men do reign in this
World. He is the Wisdom of God which says in the Proverbs, By me Kings reign.

St. Augustine in his 115. Tract upon John, brings in Christ making this public
proclamation; Audite ergo Judaei and Gentes: audi circumcisio; audi pra putium,
audite omnia Regna terrena; non impediam Dominationem vestram in hoc mundo:
Regnum meum non est de hoc mundo. Nolite metuere metu vanissimo, quo Herodes
ille major cum Christus natus nunciaretur; expavit, and Man ^*
tot infantes, ut ad eum mors perveniret occidit; timendo quam irascendo
crudelior: Regnum meum (inquit) non est de hoc mundo. Quid vultis amplius?

upon earth. Which our Doctrina^e Fidei, Tom. ^. lib. 2. Artic. c. cap. 76, 77,

Thomas Waldensis (though a great asserter of the Popes and Bishops Supremacy
above and over Kings in spiritual things) asserts at large; and thence inferrs
and largely proves these conclusions, pointblank against the forecited Papal
pretensions, 1. Regia Potestas prima sua origin a Deo est, and non a
Sacerdote. 2. Quamquam ministerio Episcoporum R^gibus imponantur Coronae and
insignia conferantur, non est propterea dicendum Regiam illam dignitatem ortum
habere a Sacerdote. 3. Reges fuerunt ante Sacerdotes ad regnum evecti, 4.
Dicentes, quod radix potestatis terrenae in tantum dependet a Papa, ut ex
commissione ejus executio derivetur in Principem, and errante Principe potest
Summus Sacerdos negotium illud temporale administrare, decipiuntur. 5. Regia
Potestas cedit Sacerdotali ubi de rebus divinis agitur, Sacerdotalis vero cedit
Regiae, in negotiis terrenis. In fine, Cardinal Bellarmin himself is enforced
to profess, De Romano Pontifice l. 5. c. 4. and Recognitio, l. 5. c. 4. de

That Christ as man whiles he lived upon earth, had neither Temporal Dominion,
neither did nor would he exercise any such temporal power; I have read (says
he) the Books of the Fathers with what diligence I could, and I have often read
them to deny Christ, to have a Temporal or Earthly kingdom; but I have no where
read them to affirm, that he had such a Kingdom. 1. That Christ had a Universal
Kingdom of power, as he was God; 2 A Spiritual kingdom of Grace: and a third,
which is an eternal Kingdom of glory, I do read; but that he had a fourth
kingdom, which is properly temporal, such as other Kings here upon earth have,
I find not either in the Scriptures or Fathers; yea, I esteem such a Kingdom to
be contrary to the poverty of Christ, mentioned in the Scriptures, and to
savor of the errors of the Jews and Heretics. De Planctu Ecclesiae lib: 1.

See Dr. Crakenthorp of the Popes Temporal Monarchy, c. 1.
other Popish Parasites, endeavor to evade these Texts objected against the
Popes Temporal Monarchy; asserting, That Christ had a Temporal Kingdom, and
that his Universal Kingdom takes away all other Kingdoms, who by his death has
evacuated all other Principalities, Powers, Empires and temporal Kingdoms in
the world, and bought them to himself from the Devil, to whom Adam by his Sin
had sold them, and given the Pope, his Viceroy, the universal possession of
them by little and little since his death, (which they show not) though himself
never actually possessed them during his abode on earth. But their answers are
so false, so absurd, I shall not spend time to refell them; but proceed.

2ly. Christ and his Apostle Saint Peter, by Mat. 17. 24, 25, 26. 27. Gratian,
Cause. 23, q^. 8.
Peter's own hand, paid Tribute to Caesar, for himself and Peter, working a
Miracle to pay it, having no money in his purse; causing, commanding Peter to
catch just so much as both their Polemoneys came to, in a Fishes mouth. And he
asserted Mat: 22. 17 to 12. Mar. 12. 16, 17. Lu: 20. 22. to 26: See Ambrosius
Oration 5. cont^a Auxentium. Gra^ian, Cause. 11. qu. 1.
the right of Caesar's Tribute, commanding all To give unto Caesar the things
that are Cesars; (mentioned in the first place) and unto God the things that
are Gods, with the same obedience and tie of conscience: Yea, though he was the
natural Son of God and King David too, which might have exempted him and his
Disciples from rendering Tribute to Caesar, yet he paid it not only de facto,
but ex debito, to fulfill all righteousness, as Jerome; and least He and Peter
should give an offense unto them; not they take scandal at it; as Comment. in
17 Mat.
Cardinal Cajetan, Lucas Burgensis and others Note. Now had he been a Temporal
King then and there de facto, he should have received Tribute from others, yea
those who demanded it from him and Peter, not have paid it thus unto them to
the prejudice of his Temporal Dominion and Kingship. Oration ^. (...) Auxentium.
St. Ambrose from this example of Christ's paying Tribute, makes his inference;
Tributum petit Imperator non negamus Magnum quidem est and speciale documentum
quo Christiani very and Praelati sublimioribus potestatibus docentur debere
esse subjecti; ne quis constitutionem terrenae Regis putet esse solvendam. Si
enim censum Filius Dei solvit, Quis tu tantus es qui putas esse non solvendum?
which he backs with Rom: 13. 1. etc. 1 Pet. 2 13. This resolution of his is
inserted into the body of the Canon Law, Gratian cause. 11: qu. 1. cap. Si
Tributum, and cause. 23. qu. 8. which is likewise confessed by Pope Gregory the
1. and Pope Urban there cited by Gratian, and the Glossers thereon; And not
only so, but this very Speech of Christ to Peter; Give unto them for me and
thee; and the Officers demand unto Peter; Does not your Master pay Tribute?
coupled with Christ's demand to Peter; Of whom do the Kings of the Earth receive
tribute, or custom? of their own children, or strangers? is produced as a
strong Argument for Peter's Supremacy over all the rest of the Apostles; and his
Universal Vicarship, since he alone was coupled with, and made equal to Christ
himself in paying the Pollmoney, and much insisted on by De Planctu Ecclesiae,
l. 1. 55. f. 40.

Boniface the 7. by his Papal authority decreed Anno 1296 That That no

means whatsoever pay any Aids or Tribute to any Secular Prince, (though
demanded of them upon urgent occasions) upon which all the Convocation,
Bishops, Clergy of England in two several Parliaments peremptorily refused to
grant or pay any Aid to King Edw. 1. for the necessary defense of the Realm;
for which he put them all out of his protection, and confiscated their goods;
and other See Gratian, Cause. 11. quaest. 1. Cause: 23. quaest. S. Ostiensis,

Popes, Canonists, plead a general Exemption of all Prelates, Clergymen, and
Religious persons from Taxes and Tributes to their Princes, contrary to the
express precepts and presidents of Christ himself, St. Peter, St. Paul, St.
Ambrose, and those two Popes constitutions, to evade this Argument of
Subjection to Kings and Emperors as the Supreme powers.

3ly. Christ foretold his Disciples, that they should be brought before Kings,
Governors, and Councils for his sake, for a Testimony against them; and he
promised, to give them in that hour, what to answer to accusers, by way of
submission to their Regal power and jurisdiction; not to demurr unto it, as
having no power over them, and totally exempted from their temporal
Jurisdiction; (as Popes and Priests claim now.) Yea Christ himself, the very
Lord of Glory; Mat. 10. 18, 19, 20. Mar: 13. 10, 11. Lu. 12. 10, 11. Acts 9. 5.
submitted himself without any reluctance or demurrer to the Jurisdiction of
Pontius Pilate the Governor, who adjudged him to be crucified; Who demanding of
him at his trial, John 19. 9, 10.
Know thou not, that I have POWER to crucify thee, Mat: 27. Mar: 15. Lu:
23. John 5. 19.
and I have POWER to release thee? He answers, Thou could have no Power over
me, unless it were given thee from above: thereby acknowledging, That his
temporal power over him was vested in him by God; therefore not to be resisted,
but submitted to, as Peter himself at his martyrdom.

4ly. Christ professed, Luke 12. 47. John 12. 47: Lu. 12. 13, 14.
I came not to Judge the world, as a temporal King or Judge: upon which
account, 1 Pet: 2. 9.
when one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother that he may
divide the inheritance with me: He said unto him, Man, who made me a judge, or
divider over you? Thereby declaring, that he had no judicial, inherent temporal
power over any private persons inheritance from God or Man ^ much less then
over Kings and Kingdoms.

5ly. As Christ himself disclaimed all temporal Regal power and jurisdiction:
so his Apostle St. Peter, (from whose pretended Primacy all Popes derive their
Titles, claims both to Regal and Pontifical Jurisdiction) in his first
Catholic Epistle to all Gods elect ones, as well Bishops, Priests, as Laymen
in all the earth: After he had acquainted them with the excellency of their
Christian state; that they are Rev: 15. 6. c. 9. 10. c. 20. ^.
a chosen generation, a Royal Priesthood, (and Popes pretend to no more then
what every good christian, by St. Peter's verdict, enjoyes in common with them)
an holy Nation, a peculiar people, now the people of God, though no people
before, etc. lest they should pretend an exemption thereby from all Kings and
Civil Magistrates, as being as much advanced above their Jurisdiction by ^ Pet:
2. 13, 14, 15, 16.
Christ's (the King of Kings) making them Kings and Priests to God his Father:
(as Popes and Popish Prelates pretend they are) presently subjoyns this quite
contrary Practice and peremptory precept;k (...), Subjecti estote igitur: Be ye
therefore Subject to every Ordinance of Man, (or human creature) for the Lord,
or Lords sake; (...) whether to the King as Supreme, (Regi ut Supereminenti) as
the Vulgar, Arias Montanus, and others translate it; (not to my self, as
Christ's supreme Vicar General, or my successors at Rome) Or unto Governors;
which he backs with these invincible reasons: 1. Because they are sent by God
himself, though ordained by men, as to the execution of their offices, as these
next words, as those who are sent by him, (to wit, by the LORD, for whose sake
you ought thus to submit unto them, as Rom: 13. 1, 2, 4, 6. and the sense
resolve, not by me, or my Vicars) and that to be Supreme Governors over you.
2ly. Because sent by God only, for the punishment of evil doers; as well
Christians as Pagans, Popes, Priests, as Lay-christians; if you do ill, as the
Gentiles accuse you to be Evil doers: v: 12. etc. 3. 16. and so subject to
their Jurisdiction only, and not to mine, or your own Pastors, if proved such.
3ly. Because they are also thus sent, for the praise of them that do well; so
that they by your honest conversation and good works, which they shall behold,
and submission to their power and Government; will not only praise you; but
glorify God in the day of their visitation; and become Christians too. 4ly. For
so is the will of God, that you should thus submit to them as Supreme; and with
well doing put to silence the ignorance of foolish men, who falsely accuse you
to pretend an exemption from all Secular power; A^ free, yet not using your
liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servabts of God. 5ly. He
thence inferts, Honor all Men (that is, all Supreme Governors) to whom Honor
is due, Rom: 13. 7. Fear God, Honor the King, in a more signal manner, as
Supreme, and Gods Viceroy upon Earth; the honoring of whom for the Lords sake,
will evidence to the world and your own consciences that you fear God; when
your disobedience to, exempting your selves from, and advancing your selves
above them, will discover, that you Prove: 24: 21, 22. Eccles. ^. 1:
fear him not.

Innocent the 3d. with other Popes and their Alvarus Pelagius de Plan^^^
Eccles. lib. 1. Art: 31. etc.
Parasites, to evade Saint Peter's text, assert; 1. That it extends only to
those who receive temporal things from the Emperor, who in temporal things is
Supreme (which yet he and his Successors elsewhere contradict) but not to
spiritual things, wherein Pontifex antecellit, which excel temporal things, as
much as the soul does the body. 2ly. That it is not said simpliciter, Subjecti
estote; but with this addition, propter Deum; which extenuates and qualifies
it. 3ly. Neither is it purely written Regi praecellenti, sed interpositum
Forsttan, non sine causa. 4ly. Ad vindictam malefactorum extends only to those,
qui utentes gladio ejus sunt Jurisdictioni subjecti: not to Priests, whose
Promotion of Priesthood advances them above Kings and kingdoms, Jer. 1.
totally to root up and to destroy, and to build and plant them.

To which evasions I answer: 1. That St. Peter makes no such distinction of
Temporalties and Spiritualties; nor that the King or Emperor is supreme in the
one, but himself, Popes, Prelates only in the other, as this Pope does. 2ly. He
acknowledges the King Supreme in both, it being Heresy (as they assert) to
Here p. ^.
hold two Supreme heads, and two Principles of power in and over one body. 3ly.
Peter writes this Epistle to all the Elect Saints, as 1 Pet* 2. 5. to 14.
Gods peculiar people, heritage, a Royal, holy Priesthood, and an holy Church,
Nation unto God; enjoining them upon this consideration only, not as mere
worldlings, to submit to Kings and Governors as Supreme, without one word of
his own, his Successots, or others supremacy over them: therefore it extends to
spiritual as well as to temporal Supremacy. 4ly. This Pope acknowledges the
Emperor to be Supreme in Temporal things, which he bestows on others, who
receive them. But Popes (as G^atian Did: 96. Alvarus Pelagius, lib. ^. Artic.
37. Eugubinus Steuchus de (...). Constantini; See Dr. Crakenthorps Defense of
Constantine, cap. 7, ^. etc.
themselves and flatterers confess) have received all their temporalties, and
St. Peter's Patrimony from the Gifts of Emperors, as Constantine, Charles the
Great, and others: Therefore they ought to acknowledge him Supreme in temporal
things at least, notwithstanding all their recited vaunts and passages denying
it. 5ly. St. Peter and Bishops had then Acts 3. 3. to 19. Bernard de
Consideratione ad Eugeni^m, lib. 2. and 3.
neither Silver, gold, nor temporal possessions at all, nor yet those Strangers
scattered by persecutions through Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphilia, to whom
he writes; who all sold their possessions, and were spoiled of their goods,
when he sent this Epistle to them. Therefore Saint Peter rather intended Kings
and Governors to be supreme in ecclesiastical matters, in 1 Pet. 1. 1* 7, 8.
c* 23. 16, 17. Acts 2. 44, 45. c. 4. 34, to the end, c. 5, 10. Hebr. 10. 32,
33, 34. 1 Thessalonians. 2. 14. 15.
rewarding; praising and encouraging them in good works, and in a Christian,
honest, pious conversation, and punishing them for sins contrary to and
scandalizing their Christian profession; then for temporal matters 2ly. His 2d.
evasion does not deny, nor diminish, but fortify Kings Supremacy: For if he
had commanded them to submit to Kings and Governors as supreme by the bare
Ordinance of men alone, this had been no strong obligation in point of
conscience to them; but when he adds for the Lords sake: this superadds divine
authority to this humane Ordinance, and binds them in point of conscience
toward God, and as they are Christians to this submission to them. Antiqu.
Judaeorum, l. 17* c. 3. and lib. 18. c. 1. 2.
Josephus relates that in his time (not long before this Epistle written) there
rose up a crafty arrogant sect of the Pharisees; et interdum Regibus quoque
infestum; ut eos etiam aperte oppugnare non verentur; necnon cum tota gens
Judeorum fidem suam jurejurando obligasset Regi et Caesari, hi solum non
iuraverunt, being above six thousand men in number, hoc nomine a Rege
mulctatis: and pretending to know secrets by divine Revelations, they openly
proclaimed (like some of our late Republicans and Fanatics, in relation to the
King and his Royal family) Decretum esse a Deo regnum ablatum ab Herod et eius
progeny transfer ad Pheronem, uxorem ejus and communes liberos: And they
with others held, That being Abraham's seed, and Gods people they ought not to
be in subjection or pay Tribute to the Roman Emperor and Pagan Kings: Hereupon
the Jewish and other Christians were then suspected, accused to be Tertulliani
Apologia and ad Scapulam, lib.
enemies to Kings, and Caesar; yea to deny subjection, tribute and an Oath of
Allegiance to them as supreme chief Governors, as these Pharisees did. To take
off this slander, Saint Peter (and Paul too) did in their Epistles, as well as
Sermons, most earnestly and particularly press Christians subjection,
obedience to Emperors; Kings, Princes, and all Secular powers, even for the
Lords and conscience sake, as ordained and sent by God himself, and a duty
enjoined them by the very Will and Gospel of God; as Chrysostom, Haymo, Soto,
Calvin, Gualther, Willet, Pareus, Perrerius, most other Commentators on the
place, and Bellarmine himself acknowledge. To which Doctrine, practice, nothing
could have been more diametrically contrary, then to set up such a Universal
Temporal Monarchy and Ecclesiastical Supremacy in Peter, and his pretended
Successors in the Sea of Rome it self (then the seat of the Roman Emperors) as
they now pretend to, inconsistent with the Emperors Supremacy, and all Kings
Government, Regal power, here knocked down and crushed in the shell by St.
Peter's own hand, keys, and sacred pen. This Pope his 3d evasion is most
absurd: For had it been Submit your selves therefore Regi praecellenti, as this
Innocent would have Peter vary it, it would have extended only to one King
alone, then most eminent, or to Christ; whereas now it relates to all Kings and
Governors too, who have Regal, or supreme Authority: and the addition after
it, as Supreme, is so far from extenuating the Kings Supremacy, that it more
fully, emphatically asserts it: not with a forsitan, as he mistakes, (which
would have made the Supremacy disputable) but with a quasi, or sicut
supereminenti; which puts it out of question; like that of Romans 1. 21. Because
when they knew God they glorified him not sicut Deus, as God: which last
clause, as God, adds luster, yea Divine Glory to his Deity, which it
identically not comparatively sets forth and asserts. His 4th. evasion, that
this precept extends only to Lay-christians, Gratian Distinct. 31. cause. 11.
qu. 2. Here p. 37.
as to Kings and Governors civil power, not to Bishops, Priests, especially to
Popes, (exempt from, above all human judicature) is most false. For this
Epistle is general to all the elect of God, to whom he directs it; whereof some
no doubt were Elders, and Ministers of the Church, as himself informs us, c. 5.
1, 2, 3. 2ly. He gives this command in precise terms, 1 Pet: 1. 1, 2.
To all who came unto Christ the living and precious stone, and were built up
on him (not Peter) 2 Pet: 2, 4, 5.
as lively stones, a spiritual house, an Holy and Royal Priesthood, to offer up
spiritual sacrifices unto God. I hope Popes, Popish Prelates and Mass Priests
dare not assert, that Lay-Christians only are this Holy and Royal Priesthood;
since they wholly See Bellarmin. and others De Clericis and Sacerdotio. Gratian
Distinctio 22, 96.
appropriate it to themselves, as no ways belonging to the Laity, (though St.
Peter equally extends it to both, without distinction:) Therefore this precept
most belongs to them. 4ly. They of all others have See Philip Morney his
Mysterium Iniquitatis; Centuriae Magd: 5. to 13. and my Antipathy of the Lordly
Prelacy to Unity and Monarchy.
in all ages most invaded, oppugned the temporal, magistratical Supremacy of
Kings and Emperors: Therefore they were principally intended by Saint Peter,
who would not press that submission only on the Laity, from which himself, all
Bishops and Clergymen (their guides and presidents of obedience) were totally
exempted. 3dly. St. Peter makes no such distinction as Popes now do, between
Lay-Christians and Clergymen, (yea he defines those now styled the Laity to be
Cleri, the Lords Clergy or Heritage, 1 Pet: 5. 3. not the Elders) nor between
himself, Popes, Prelates, and other Presbyters, as Popes and others since make:
yea, such a distinction would have not only verified, but aggravated the
calumnies, accusations of the Pagans against the Christians; For had he
informed those to whom he writes, and the Roman Pagan Emperors, Kings,
Governors then ruling, that all Lay Christians ought to be subject to them as
Supreme in all temporal things held of them; but that himself, and all
Christian Bishops, Elders, Ministers were totally exempted from their power,
and had the sole Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction originally in themselves; by
virtue whereof they could root up and pull down, build up and plant them, their
Empires, Kingdoms, Nations, at their pleasures; and were set over them for that
very purpose, as Jeremiah was, in this Popes sense, not Gods. This certainly
would have incensed all Emperors, Kings, and Governors against them, to their
total and final extirpation, as the archest Traitors, Rebels, that ever the
world produced. This Popes distinction therefore, was as far from St. Peter's
meaning, as he was from his humility. 6ly. St. Peter in this very Epistle, as
he styles himself only, 1 Pet. 5. ^, 2, 3, 4.
an Elder; yea fellow Elder (not Christ's Vicar, Viceroy, Head of his Church
etc. as Popes since have done) so he exhorts the Elders of the Church only as
his fellows, (not commands them as their Lord) to feed the flock of Christ
which is amongst them; neither as being Lords over Gods heritage, (as Popes now
make themselves) but being ensamples to the flock. Therefore those Kings and
Governors to whom he enjoined them to submit themselves (not Peter, nor these
Elders) as Supreme, were Supreme over them in all temporal and ecclesiastical
Causes, as well as over their flocks, to whom they were to be examples herein
as well as in other particulars. 7ly. De Romano Pontifice l. 2. Amesii
Bellarminus Enervatus, Tom. 3. p. 175, 176.
Bellarmin affirms Saint Peter's first Universal Epistle to be written from
Rome, from this salutation in the cloze thereof; 1 Pet: 1. 13.
The Church which is at Babylon saluteth you; affirming this Babylon to be
Rome, to prove Peter's being Bishop thereof, and his Universal Supremacy, as
Christ's Vicar, since devolved unto Popes; Wherein he makes the Church of Rome a
true Antichristian Babylon, and mother of confusion, in perverting this Epistle
from Rome, so pregnant for the Temporal and Ecclesiastical Supremacy of Kings
and Temporal Magistrates over all their Christian subjects, as well of the
Clergy, as Laity, so far, as to give the Pope an absolute Supremacy over Kings
and Emperors themselves, which never entered into St. Peter's heart, nor was ever
claimed or exercised, but abominated by him, and thus Decreed against in his
unerring chair. Yet De Planctu Eccles. l. 1. artic. 37.
Alvarus Pelagius concludes with Pope Innocent from this very Text of Peter, ex
praedictis clare patet, Papa est Universalis Monarcha totius populi christiani,
and denuo totius mundi: ita quod velit nolit, quicunque viator Papae de jure
subjicitur ut Praelato.

6ly. Saint Peter in his second Universal Epistle, chap: 2. gives a most lively
character of Popes Apostasy, ambition, covetousness, uncleanness, injustice
and presumption; more especially in despising all Dominion over them by
Emperors, Kings, and Magistrates, in speaking evil of Dignities, without fear
of God or Man, in defiance of his first Epistle, and bringing many railing
accusations against them; (as they do in their Epistles, Decrees, Bulls, Books
against their Supremacies) whereas Angels who are greater in power and might,
dare not do it. Yet these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and
destroyed, speak evil of those Dignities they understand not, and shall utterly
perish in their own corruption, and receive the reward of unrighteousness; as
many Popes, Popish Prelates, Rebels, Regicides See Philip Morney, Hist.
Papatus. Aventinus Annal. Boiorum l. 4* 5, 6. Dr. Beards Theater of Gods
Judgments.
have done; both in the field, and Courts of Justice, for maintaining the Popes
Unchristian Usurpations over the Crowns, kingdoms, persons, lives of their
Lawful Emperors, Kings, and Princes: Therefore Popes must henceforth either
for ever renounce their Universal Vicarship, Sovereignty, as neither enjoyed,
exercised, owned, but professedly and eternally subverted by St. Peter himself,
from whom alone they derive it; or else St. Peter will eternally disclaim them
by these General Texts and Universal Epistles, to be either his Successors, or
Christ's Vicars, but mere Antichristian Impostors.

7ly. St. Paul (the first real Apostle, and sole Bishop of Rome, In Romans 13.
to whom he only writ (if any Apostle was so) at least joint Bishop with Peter
(if ever Bishop there) as Contra Haereses, lib. 1. Her. 27. col. 88, 89.
Epiphanius, Eccles. Hist. l. 3. c. 31.
Eusebius, and others attest) even in his very Epistle to the Saints and Church
of Rome it self, has put in an eternal Bar against the pretended Supremacy of
Popes, as St. Peter did (in his Epistles from it) Rom: 13. 1, to 3. where he
gives a universal precept to all present and future Saints and Members of the
Roman Church (as well Popes, Prelates, Priests, and other Ecclesiastics, as
Lay-Christians or Pagans, as the Chrysostom Homil. 23: in Romans 13. Th^odoret,
Theodulus, Occumeninius, Sedulius, Theophilact in Romans 13*
Fathers resolve) Let every Soul be subject to the higher Powers (not to Paul
or Peter, who enjoin obedience to them) acknowledged by all to be the Roman
Emperors, Senate, though then mere Pagans; not abolished nor translated to
Peter, by Christ himself; and that upon these unanswerable reasons: 1. Because
there is no power but of God. 2ly. The power that are (then in being, and so
not abolished by Christ, but ratified) are ordained and ordered by God. 3ly.
Whosoever therefore resists (much more then who usurp, abolish, as Popes and
their Parasites do) the power, resists the Ordinance of God. 4ly. Those that
resist, shall receive to themselves damnation; not a Papal canonization. 5ly.
For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. 6ly. Those that do
good, need not fear the Power, yea they shall have praise and rewards, as well
as protection from the same. 7ly. For he is the minister of God to thee for
good. 8ly. But if thou do that which is evil, He (not the Pope) bears not the
sword (of Justice) in vain, for he is the Minister of God, a Revenger (in God
stead) to execute wrath upon him that does evil. 9ly. (From all these premises
he draws this peremptory conclusion,) Wherefore ye must needs be subject not
only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. 10ly. For, for this cause pay you
tribute also, for they (not Bishops or Priests) are Gods (not Saint Peter's, or
the Popes) Ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. 11ly. From
all which he thus concludes, Render therefore to All (Higher powers that are)
their Dues, (by Divine, Evangelical right) Tribute to whom Tribute is due,
custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor, (in the
affirmative:) Owe nothing to any man (in power, as well as out) but to love one
another: obeying them out of love, not fear. What now is become of St. Peter's,
or his pretended successors Monarchy, Headship over the Church, or Emperor of
Rome himself, which St. Paul's sword has for ever decapitated?

Yet some Popes and their Alvarus Pelagius de Planctu Eccles. lib. 1. Art. 37.
Janissaries are so impudent as to assert, it cannot be argued or enforced from
this Text, that the Pope, Church, Clergy are subject to Emperors and Kings,
though they pay Tribute to them, as a badge of their subjection, even out of
their Church Lands, as Orat. 5. contra Auxentium, Gratian Cause. 23. qu. 8.
St. Ambrose, and others confess they ought to pay by Christ's and Peter's
examples; and that Popes, Clergymen are not within these universul words, Let

of Sienna. Omnis anima (inquit) potestatibus sublimoribus subdita sit. Si

qui vobis dicere solent, Servate vestrae sed is honorem; Though they violate
this express command of Christ, and the Apostle. Comment. in cap. 13. ad

Theodoret Bishop of Cyprus thus expounds this Text; Let every Soul be subject
to the higher powers, whether he be any Priest or my Bishop, (then certainly
any Pope or Popish Prelate) or any Monk; he must yield subjection to those to
whom Magistracy is given. Comment. in Romans 13.
Theodulus Bishop of Caelosyria concurs with him upon this reason; For that the
Gospel was not given for the subversion of the public Civil Government and
order. In cap. 13. ad Romanos.
St. Chrysostom Patriarch of Constantinople (Romes and Popes Corrivals for
precedence) goes one step higher in his Exposition of this Text; For All,
whether thou be a Priest, or a Prophet, or an Apostle (therefore a Pope, or a
Monk, which his next words certainly include) or whosoever else thou be, every
one is commanded to obey these Higher Powers. The like do In cap. 13. ad
Romanos.
Oecumenius, See Dr: Willet. Peter Martyr, Paraeus and others in locum
Theophylact, and sundry others conclude against these Papal Impostors, and
praevaricators of this unanswerable Text for Regal Supremacy.

8ly. To put this out of doubt, the same St. Paul in his First Epistle to
Timothy (whom Popes and all Espenceus, Bishop Hall, Bishop Bilson, Bp. Downham,
and others. My Vnbishopping of Timothy and Titus.
Prelates assert to be the first and sole Bishop of Ephesus) 1 Timothy: 2. 1, 2, 3.
exhorts him, that First of all supplications, prayers, intercessions and
giving of thanks should be made For Kings, and for all that are in Authority,
that We (including himself and Timothy as well as other Christians) may lead a
quiet and peaceable life See the Collect for the King.
under them as all expound it) in all Godliness (relating to Gods Worship,
Religion, and Spiritual affairs) and Honesty, extending to all temporal
matters; For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior: And
in his Epistle to Titus (whom they repute See my Vnbishoping of Timothy and
Titus.
Archbishop of Crete) he gives him this express charge: Tit: 3. 1*
Put them in mind to be subject to Principalities and Powers, to obey
Magistrates, etc. For we our selves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
deceived. In both which Texts he peremptorily enjoynes, not only continual
prayers for, but also subjection and real obedience to all Civil Magistrates;
Principalities, Powers, Kings, Governors, as the Higher powers (to which
himself then submitted and obeyed since he was an Apostle of Christ, though
formerly disobedient to them; while foolish, and deceived; and to which Timothy
and Titus themselves submitted, as well as their flocks; it being a moral,
universal duty, tending to the Churches and all Christians peace, quietness,
advancement of all Col. 1. 16*
godliness, honesty, yea good and acceptable in the sight of God and Christ
our Savior, by and for whom all Thrones, Dominions, principalities, powers
both in heaven and earth were created.

even Atheistical Delusions will satisfy no sober Christians conscience, nor
yet evade these and St. Peter's own forecited Texts, Precepts; which the Pope
cannot dispense with, unless he will make the Servant above; greater then his
Lord, John 13. 16. c. 15. 20.
and the Vicar then the Master.

9ly. Mat. 15. 4* 5, 6. Mar. 7. 10, 11, 12.
Christ himself, together with Paul and Peter, do from the 5th Commandment
most frequently press and inculcate all Ephesians. 5 22, 2^, 24. c. 6. 1, to 10.
Col. 2. 18, to 25. 1 Timothy 6 1, 2.
due subjection and obedience by Wives unto their Husbands, Children to their
Parents, and Servants to their Masters in all things, and that with fear and
trembling, in singleness of heart as unto Christ; not with eye-service as
men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the
heart, and with good will doing them service, as to the Lord and not to men,
knowing that of the LORD they shall receive the Inheritance; for (herein) they
serve the Lord Christ. Therefore there is the self-same relation, obedience due
to Kings and Magistrates, (the politic Husbands, Parents, Masters of the
Realm, people,) by all Members of the body politic, as there is by Wives,
children, servants, to their Husbands, Parents, Masters.

10thly. It is very observable that Christ himself, with his Apostles Peter and
Paul do in the New Testament more frequently, punctually, energetically
inculcate this duty of 1. Pet. 2. 18, 1^ c 3. 1, 2, 3.
subjection, obedience, honor, paying Tribute to Emperors, Kings, and Civil
Magistrates (though then all Pagans, unbelievers) yea for all Wives, Children,
Servants to obey, fear, and reverence their Husbands, Parents, Masters in the
flesh; on all sorts of Christians, under the Gospel, then ever they were urged
or reiterated in the Old Testament before or under the Law; and that for these
ends and upon these accounts, as I humbly apprehend; First, to evidence, That
all Kings, Supreme Civil Magistrates, Parents under the Gospel enjoy the
selfsame Sovereign Jurisdiction over all Civil, Ecclesiastical persons, things,
and their children under the Gospel, as they did before or under the Law in the
Old Testament; and that the Kingship, Kingdom of Christ under the Gospel did no
ways diminish nor eclipse (much less abolish; or transfer to Apostles,
Bishops, Presbyters, or Chapters) any part of their ancient Temporal or
Spiritual Authority before and under the Law. 2ly. To make the free Romans 13. 1,
t^ ^^. 1 Timothy 2. 1^ 2, 3.
passage for the preaching and reception of the Gospel among all Nations,
Kingdoms, Republikes in the world, as consistent with, and no ways opposing,
but advancing, rarifying their respective Civil Governments, by prescribing
every soul to yield all cheerful obedience, subjection to their Civil
Governors, Laws, for the peace and tranquillity of their Kingdoms. 3ly. To stop
the mouths of Pagans and all Enemies of Christian Religion, and Christians, 1
Pet. 2. 12, to 17. c. 3. 16 Tertull: Apol. Athenagoras apologia pro Christianis.
who traduced and accused them as opposites and Enemies to, and rebels against
Emperors, Kings, Magistrates, their Government and Laws. 4ly. To take away all
pretenses from 1 Pet. 2. 16.
Libertins and yoaklesse Christians, under pretext of Christian Liberty, and
the privileges of Christianity to disobey contemn all Kings, Magistrates Laws
and Civil Government, as exempted from their power. 5ly. To lessen and control
the Antichristian Usurpations of the Popes, Prelates, Clergy of Romans 13. 1, to
10.
Rome it self, and their Confederates elsewhere, upon the Crowns,
prerogatives, rights and kingdoms of Christian Kings and Emperors which should
embrace the Gospel: All which reasons are expressed or intimated in the Gospel
it self, Paul's Epistle to the Romans, and St Peter's.

11ly. St Paul in his second Epistle to Timothy (a Bishop, as all Popes,
Bishops assert) in relation to his spiritual warfare, lays down this universal
Maxim, which every good Soldier of Jesus Christ must observe, 2 Timothy 2. 3, 4.
No man that warreth intangleth himself with the Affairs of this Life, that he
may please him who has chosen him to be a Soldier. If then no Bishop or good
Spiritual Soldier of Jesus Christ, must so much as once entangle themselves
with the affairs of this world and life, that so they may discharge their
duties, as to please Christ, who has chosen them to be his soldiers: then
certainly neither Christ nor his Apostles ever gave or committed to any
Apostle, Pope, Bishop, or Minister of the Gospel, any Supreme Temporal
Jurisdiction, over all or any Kings, Kingdoms or Civil Corporations in the
world, Romans 13. 6.
which require continual attendance, and would totally Acts 6. 2, etc.
avocate them from their spiritual warfare.

12ly. The Apostles themselves (though inspired from Heaven what to preach,
without much study) when there was a complaint made to them, Acts 6. 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7.
that the widows and poor were neglected in the daily ministration, calling all
the multitude of Disciples to them, said, It is not Reason that we should leave
the World of God and serve Tables; wherefore Brethren, look ye out among you
seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost, and wisdom, whom we may
appoint over this business: But we will give our selves continually unto the
Ministry of the World: And the saying pleased the whole multitude, who
thereupon chose Stephen and 6. more Deacons to attend the poor: whereupon the
word of God increased, and the number of Disciples multiplied in Jerusalem
greatly. If the Apostles then thought it against reason, that they should once
or twice a day serve Tables, and the poor, (though an act of charity and piety)
as being inconsistent with their Apostolical Office, Ministry; and thereupon
ordained Deacons to discharge the trust: Then certainly it cannot but be
against Reason and Scripture to assert, That Christ gave, or any of his
Apostles by divine right and institution ever had, claimed, exercised, or ought
to enjoy any the least Temporal Jurisdiction or Dominion in the world; much
less such as Popes pretend to from St. Peter, who was present at, and
assenting to this institution of Deacons: it being wholly inconsistent with
their Spiritual function.

13ly. Christ himself assured his Apostles, Mat. 6. ^4. Lu. 10. 13. 1 John 2.
15.
That no man can serve two Masters, for either he will hate the one and love
the other, or he will hold to the one and despise the other; Ye cannot serve
God and Mammon: Therefore, when Christ called his Disciples to follow him, Mat.
11. 27. Mar. 1. 18. Lu. 5. 11.
they forsook their worldly employments and all they enjoyed, that they might
apply themselves wholly to their Apostolical and Ministerial functions: And
when He called Barnabas and Paul to be Apostles, he said, Acts 13. 2.
Separate me Barnabas and Paul to the work I have appointed them. Which Paul
thus expresses; Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ, called to be an Apostle, Rom:
1. 1.
Separate unto the Gospel of Jesus Christ; being wholly taken off from all
secular employments as incompatible with their Apostolical Function. Upon which
Account he gives this charge to all other Ministers; Rom: 12. 6, 7, 8.
He that has the gift of the ministry, let him wait on the ministry; Gratian
cause. 21. qu. 3. Summa Angelic^. Clericus 9.
and he that teaches in teaching, and he that exhorts on exhortation; He
that rules (as a Magistrate) let him do it with diligence. Whence sundry
Fathers, Councils, Popes Decretals, Canonists, Schoolmen, have prohibited all
Bishops, Priests and Clergymen to intermeddle as Judges, Advocates, Proctors or
Sollicitors, in any secular affairs; as Gul. Nubrigensis, hist. l. 4. c. 4.
Antiqu. Eccles. Brit. p. 140, 141.
inconsistent with their spiritual function under pain of deprivation;
Therefore it is most certain, That Christ never gave to Peter, or any other
Apostle, Bishop, Minister, any Temporal Jurisdiction over Kings, kingdoms, or
in temporal affairs, being diametrically contrary to and inconsistent with
their spiritual vocations.

14ly. St. Paul charge Timothy (a Bishop, as Bishops assert) 1 Timothy 4. 13,
14, 15.
To give himself wholly to reading, exhortation and doctrine, that his
profiting might appear before all men: and give him, with all other Bishops,
Presbyters, and Ministers of the Gospel this dreadful charge; 2 Timothy 4. 1, 2
I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge
the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his kingdom: Preach the word, be
instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all
long-suffering and doctrine; denouncing a Woe 1 Cor. 9. 16, 17
to himself if he preach not the Gospel; which he thereupon preached constanly,
Acts 19. 8, 9, 10. c. 20. 20, 31. c. 28. 30, 31. Romans 15. 19, 20
publicly, and from house to house, as Lu: 21. 37, 38. John 8. 1. 2: Acts 2.
48. c. 4. 31. c. 5. 41.
Christ and his Apostles daily preached it; whose 1 John 2. 6. Phil: 3. 17.
Col. 4. 17.
examples all Bishops, Popes, Ministers ought to follow. Now this they could
not possibly do, had they all Temporal and Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction
delegated to them, the execution whereof would See Matt. Parker Antiqu. Eccles.
Brit: p. 138, to 142. in Vita Huberti. Bernard. de Consid. l. 1. and 3.
totally divert, or very much interrupt them in their ministerial Office,
preaching, instructing the people, and other duties of their Ministry.
Therefore it is infallible, Christ never gave to any of them any temporal
Jurisdiction.

15ly. St. Paul blaming the 1 Cor: 6. 3, 4, 5, 6.
Christians of the Church of Corinth, for going to Law with their brethren
before Pagan Judges, to the scandal of christianity, does not delegate the
hearing and decision of such controversies to the Bishops or Elders of the
Church; but advises them, To set them to Judge who are least esteemed in the
Church; as no ways fit for the Bishops and Pastors thereof: Therefore they
neither had, nor ought to have any Temporal Jurisdiction.

16ly. St. Paul makes this the special badge and character of Antichrist, that
man of sin, and son of perdition, 2 Thessalonians. 2, 3, to 1^.
that he opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, (to wit,
over all Kings and secular Magistrates, styled Exodus: 4. 16* Psalm: 82. 1. 6.
Gods in the Old Testament) or that is worshipped; so that he as God sits in
the Temple of God, showing himself that he is God. And St. Rev: 13.
John describes him under the Notion of a b^ast, exercising temporal
Jurisdiction in the Church and State, causing all, both great and small, rich
and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or foreheads;
and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark: and that he had
power given him over all Kingdoms, Tongues and Nations; (which Popes now claim)
so that all that dwelt on the earth worshipped him, whose names were not
written in the Lambs book. And he further subjoyns, Rev. 17. 12,
That the ten horns he saw, were ten Kings, who receive power as Kings, one
honor with the beast, who have one mind, and shall give their (Kingly) Power
and Strength unto the Beast: that so by pretext thereof, he may claim and
exercise both civil and ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, as Popes do now by pretext
of Gratian, did. 96. Marta, Alvarus Pelagius, and Dr. Crakenthorp of the Popes

Constantines, Charles the Great, and other Kings donations and resignations of
their Temporal Jurisdictions to the Pope and his Successors. Upon which account
most Abbot, Powel, Squire, Dr. Beard, De Antichristo, Phil. Morney Mysterium
Iniquitatis.
Protestant (and some Romish Divines) assert, Popes claiming exercising both
the supreme temporal and ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, over Kings, Emperors,
Kingdoms, Churches, to be the ANTICHRIST. And if so, Then that Jurisdiction
which is thus declared to be Antichristian, neither did of right belong to
Christ, nor was ever delegated by him to St. Peter, or the Bishops of Rome, or
any other Bishops whatsoever, being diametrically contrary to Christ and
Christianity.

17ly. Christ himself as he did with some indignation refuse to be a voluntary
Judge or Arbitrator in a small temporal inheritance, to divide it between two
brethren when required; saying, Lu. 12. 13, 14.
Man, who made me a Judge, or a Divider over you? neither God, nor Man the
Supreme Magistrate having given him any such Commission: So he has in precise
terms expressly prohibited all Kingly and Lordly Dominion to his Apostles, and
in them to all Popes, Prelates, Bishops and Ministers whatsoever; Mat. 20. 25,
26. Luke 22. 25, 26. And he said unto them, See Alvarus Pelagius lib. 2. Artic.
57. where he objects this and the premised Texts, and returns most pitiful
answers (...) them.
The Kings of the Gentiles exercise Lordship over them, and they that exercise
Authority upon them, are called Benefactors, (or Gracious Lords, as the old
Translations render it) But ye shall not be so, (or it shall not be so) among
you: but he that is or will be Great (or Greatest) among you, let him be your
Minister, and whosoever will be Chief among you, let him be your Servant. From

Regal and Lordly Dominion not only in Temporal, but in Ecclesiastical and
Spiritual things in Popes and Prelates of the Church, as expressly prohibited by
Christ, yea by and in Peter himself as well as others; Hear St. Bernard for all
the rest in his excellent Book (a) De Consideratione, where he thus expounds
and applies these forecited Texts against Papal Sycophants Glosses on them to
Pope Eugenius, in the ruff of his Papal grandeur.

De Consideratione l. 1. b. 2.
Nam quid tibi aliud promisit Sanctus Apostolus, quam sedula sollicitudo omnium
Ecclesiarum? Quod habeo, inquit, hoc tibi Do. Quid illud? unum scio, non est
aurum, neque argentum cum ipse dicat, Argentum and Aurum non est mihi. Esto ut
alia quacunque ratione haec tibi vindices, Acts 3. 6.
sed non Apostolico Jure. Nec enim illa tibi dare quod non habuit, potuit, Quod
habuit, hoc dedit, sollicitudinem, ut dixi, super Ecclesias. Numquid
dominationem? Audi ipsum, Non dominantes, ait, in Clero, sed forma facti
gregis. Et ne dicium sola humilitate, putes, non etiam veritate, Vox Domini est
in Evangelio, Mat: 20. 25, 26
Reges gentium dominantur eorum, and qui pote^^atem habent super eos, Lu. 22.
25, 26.
Benefici vocantur. Et infert, inter vos non sic: Planum est, Apostolis
interdicitur Dominatus. I ergo tu, et tibi usurpare aude, aut Dominans
Apostolatum, aut Apostolicus Dominatum, plane ab alterutro prohiberis: Si
utrumque similiter habere voles, perdes utrumque: Alioquin non te exceptum
illorum numero putes, de quibus queritur Deus sic: Hos: 8. 4.
Ipsi regnaverunt, and non ex me; Principes extiterunt, and non cognovi eos. I
am si regnare sine Deo juvat, habes gloriam, sed non apud Deum. Luke 22.
At si interdictum tenemus, audiamus Edictum: Qui major est vestrum, ait, fiat
sicut minor, and qui praecelsior est, sicut qui ministrat: Forma Apostolica
haec est: Dominatio interdicitur, indicitur ministratio: quae et Commendatur
ipsius exemplo legistatoris, qui secutus adjungit; Ego autem in medio vestrum
sum, 2 Cor. 11. 13*
tanquam qui ministrat. Quis se jam Titulo hoc inglorium putet, quo se prior
dominus Gloriae Praesignivit? Merito, Paulus Gloriatur in eo dicens: Ministri
Christi sunt? Et ego: and addit, ut minus sapiens dico, plus ego, in laboribus
plurimus, in carceribus abundantius, in plagis supra modum, in mortibus
frequenter. O Praeclarum Ministerium! quo nonid gloriosius principatu? Gal. 6.
14.
Si gloriari oportet, forma tibi sanctorum praesigitur, Apostolorum proponitur
gloria. Parvane tibi illa videtur? quis mihi tribuat similem fieri in gloria
Sanctorum? Clamat Apostolus, Mihi autem absit gloriari, nisi in cruce Domini
nostri Jesu Christi: Hoc Glorieris opto semper optimo genere Gloriae, quod
Apostoli, quod Prophetae delegere sibi, transmisere tibi. Agnosce haereditatem
tuam in Christi cruce, in laboribus plurimis. Felix qui dicere potuit, Plus
omnibus laboravi. He thus further disproves the Popes right to intermeddle
with, judge or determine any temporal causes, or to usurp the Scepters, Crowns,
possessions of the world, or earthly kingdoms: De Consideratione, lib. 1.
Quid servilius, indigniusque, praesertim summo Pontifici, quod non dico omni
die, sed pene omni hora, insudare talibus rebus, and pro talibus? Denique
quando oramus? quando docemus populos? quando aedificamus Ecclesiam? quando
meditamur? Et quidem quotidie perstrepunt in palatio Leges; sed Iustiniani, non
Domini. Just ne etiam istud? Ps. 19.
Tu videris. Namcerte lex Domini immaculata convertens animas. Hae autem non
tam leges quam lites sunt, et cavillationes subvertentes judicium. Tu ergo
Pastor et Episcopus animarum, qua mente obsecro sustines coram te semper silere
illam, garire istas? Fallor, si non movet tibi scrupulum perversitas haec. Da
occasionem Sapienti and sapientior erit. 1 Cor. 6.
Audiamus Apostolum, quid de hujusmodi sentiat. Sic non est inter vos sapiens
(ait ille) qui judicet inter fratrem and fratrem? Et infert; Ad ignominiam
vobis dico, contemptibiles qui sunt in Ecclesia, illos constituite ad
judicandum. Itaque, secundum Apostolum, indigne tibi usurpas tu Apostolicus
officium vile, gradum contemptibilium. Unde and dicebat Episcopus, Episcopum
instituens, 2 Timothy 2.
Nemo militans Deo implicat se negotiis secularibus. Ego autem parco tibi; non
tam fortia loquor, sed possibilia. Putas ne haec tempora sustinerent, si
hominibus litigantibus pro terrena hereditate, and flagitantibus abs te
Iudicum, Voce Domini tui responderes: Luc. 12.
O homines quis me coustituit Judicem super vos? In quale tu judicium mox
venires? Quid dicit homo rusticanus and imperitus, ignorans Primatum tuum,
inhonorans summam et preexcelsam sedem, derogans Apostolicae dignitati? Et
tamen non monstrant puto qui hoc dicent, Vbi aliquando quispiam Apostolorum
Iudex sederit hominum, Nota*
aut divisor terminorum, aut distributor terrarum: Stetisse denique lego
Apostolos judicandos, sedisse judicantes non lego: erit illud, non fuit. Ita ne
est imminutor dignitatis Servus, si non vult esse major Domino suo, aut
Discipulus si non vult esse major eo qui se misit? aut filius si non
transgreditur terminos quos posuerunt Patres sui? Luke ^2.
Quis me constituit Judicem? ait ille, Dominus, and Magister; et erit injuria
Servo, Discipuloque nisi Iudicet Vniversos? Mihi tamen non videtur bonus
estimator rerum, qui indignum putat Apostolis, seu Apostolicis viris non
judicare de talibus, quibus datu^ est judicium in majora. Quid ni centemnant
iudicare de terrems possessiunculis hominum, qui in caelestibus and Angelos
judicabunt? Mat 9.
Ergo in criminibus non in possessionibus Potestas vestra, quoniam propter
illa, non propter has, accepisti claves regni coelorum, praevaricatores utique
excludere, non possessores: Quaenam tibi major videtur and dignitas and
potestas, demittendi peccata, an predia dividendi? Sed non est comparatio:
Habent haec infima and terrena Iudices suos, Reges et Principes terrae: Quid
fines alienos invaditis: Quid falcem vestram in alienam messem extenditis? Non
quia indigni vos, sed quia indignum vobis talibus i^sistere, quippe potioribus
ocupatis, etc. Itaque haec and innumera talia dixerem, si fortia dic rem, si
recta, si sincera. Nunc autem quia dies mali sunt, sufficit interim admonitum
esse.

He proceeds thus most elegantly and pithily in answering the Popes pretenses
to the Monarchy and Possessions of all the world, as Successor to the Aposties
in their pretended Universal Principality. 4 De Consideratione, l. 3. c. 1, 3, 4
Nimis comfortatus est Principatus eorum; constituti sunt Principes super omnem
terram (only in preaching the Gospel to all Nations, as he proves from Psalm.
19.) Ps. 45, and 138.
Eis tu successisti in hareditatem; ita tuhaeres, et orbis haereditas. At
quatinus haec portio te contingit, aut contigerit illos, id sobria
consideratione pensandum; Non enim per omnem reor modum. Ut michi videtur,
dispensatio tibi super illum credita, non data possessio. Si pergis usurpare et
hanc, Psalm: 49.
contradicit tibi qui dicit, Meus est orbis terrae, and plenitudo ejus. Number tu
ille de quo Propheta; Et erit omnis terra possessio ejus? Christus hic est, qui
possessionem sibi vendicat, et jure Creationis, et merito Redemptionis, Psalm. ^.
et Dono Patris; Cui enim alteri dictum est, Postula a me, and dabo tibi Gentes
haereditatem, and possessionem tuam terminus terrae. Possessionem et Dominium
cede huic, tu curam illius habe: Pars tua haec, ultra ne extendas manum. Quid
inquis? Non negas praeesse, et Dominari vetas? Plane sic. Quasi non been
praesit, qui praeest in sollicitudine: nunquid non et villa villico, et parvus
Dominus subjectus est paedagogo? Nec tamen villae ille, nec ille sui Domini
Dominus est. Ita et tu, praesis, ut provideas, ut consulas, ut procures, Mat.
2^.
ut serves. Praesis et prosis; praesis ut fideles servus et prudens, quem
constituit Dominus super familiam suam; Ad quid, ut des illis escam in tempore:
Hoc est, ut dispenses, non imperes. Hoc fac, Dominari ne affectes hominum homo,
ut non dominetur tibi omnis iniustitia. At satis superque id intimatum supra,
cum quis sis dis^utaretur. Addo tamen et hoc^ Nullum tibi venenum, mullum
gladium plus formido, quam libidinem dominandi. Certe multum tibi tribuas, si
multum deceptus non es, Romans 1.
nil te existimas plus his accepisse a magnis Apostolis. Recordare nunc vocis
illius; Sapientibus et insipientibus debtor sum. Et^i non indebitam tibi ipsam
censes, hoc quoque simul memento, debitoris molestum nomen, Luke 1^.
servienti potius quam Dominanti congruere. Servus in Evangelio, audit; Quantum
debes Domino meo? Frgo site agnoscis sapientibus and insipipientibus non
dominatorem sed debitorem, curandum summopere tibi and tota vigilantia
considerandum, quomodo and qui non sapiunt sapiant, qui sapiant non desipiant,
and qui desipiere, resipiscant, etc. After which, he concludes with this
pathetical Exclamation, and interrogation. O ambitio ambientium Crur, quomodo
omnes torquens omnibus places? Nil acerbius cruci, at nil molestius inquietat,
nil tamen apud miseros mortales celebrius negotiis ejus. An non limina
Apostolorum plus jam ambitio quam devotio terit? An non vocibus ejus vestrum
tota die resultat palatium? An non questibus ejus tota Legum Canonumque
disciplina insudat? An non spoliis ejus omnis Italica inhiat inerplebili
aviditate rapacitas? Quid ita tua spiritualia studia non saltem intercidir, sed
occidit. Quoties sancta ac facunda tua abortori ocia fecit inquietum et
inquietans malum? Aliud est quod ab oppressis appellatur ad te: aliud autem
quod Ambitie in Ecclesia per te regnare molitur. Nec deesse illis, nec huic
aliquatinus assenrire oportet.

He concludes thus to our purpose: after a large detection of and invective
against the monstrous ambition, rapine, injustice of the Parasites, Officers,
and Ministers of the Court of Rome, he falls upon the more then Regal and
Imperial wordly pomp of the Pope himself; De Consid^ratione, l. 4.
Inter haec tu Pastor procedis deauratus, tam multa circumdarus varietate. Oves

Sic factitabat Petrus? sic Paulus (...)? Vides omnem Ecclesiasticum zelum

justum. Ita omne humite probro ^ucitur inter Palatinos, ut facilius qui esse,

ornatus vel se^icis; non tectus auro, non vectus equo albo, nec stirpatus
milite, nec circumstrepentibus septus ministris. John 21.
Absque his tamen credidit satis posse impleri salutare mandatum, Si amas me,
pasce oves meas. In his successisti non Petro, sed Constantino. Thus this
Canonized Roman Saint, Bernard, concluded long since against the Popes
pretended Monarchy to Pope Eugenius himself, with whom I shall cloze this
branch of my 4. Proposition.

For the second part thereof; That Jesus Christ as Supreme King of his kingdom,
the Church-militant upon earth, never delegated the Sovereign Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction over it, or all the Members in it, to St. Peter, or any other
Apostle, Bishop, Priest or Pope whatsoever, as his Viceroyes; but only the
ministerial part of his Prophetical (not Kingly or High Priests) office of
teaching and preaching the Gospel publicly to all Nations, administering the
Sacraments of Baptism, and Lords Supper according to his institution and
command; feeding them as his sheep with the sincere milk of his word, teaching
them (as his Apostles, Ministers, Servants) to obey what he has commanded
them; be^eeching them as his Ambassadors in his stead to be reconciled to God;
and to declare, pronounce them absolved from their sins by God, upon their
sincere repentance, and to aenounce damnation against them, if they do not
repent and believe in Christ.

I shall demonstrate the verity thereof: First, from the several Commissions,
or Precepts: 2dly. From the respective Titles given by Christ and the Gospel to
the Apostles, Peter, Bishops, Presbyters, Ministers and their respective
Offices, in and as they relate to the Kingdom, Church and people of God.

1. For their respective Commissions, I shall enumerate and examine them
distinctly. Mat. 10. 1, to 16. Mar: 3. 14. to 20. Lu. 9. 1, to 16. compared
with c. 10. 1, to 14.


The first Commission given them by Christ, was only to Mat: 28. 19, 20*
preach the Gospel and Kingdom of Heaven to the lost sheep of the House of
Israel, but not to the Samaritans and Gentiles; without any Jurisdiction or
pomp; without scr^^, gold, silver, or brass in their purses, two coats, or
staves; only as laborers worthy of their hire, or meat, which they were to
receive from those to whom they preached: Which commission imports nothing of
Supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in it, expiring before Christ's passion,
then head on earth of his Church, and equal to all the Apostles; not peculiar
to St. Peter.

The second general Grand Commission given them by Christ (wherein their office
principally consists) after his Resurrection, is thus recorded by St. Man: 16.
16, 17, 1^.
Matthew, and (d) Mark: Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every
Creature: He that believes and is baptized, shall be saved; he that believes
not shall be damned; Go ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of
the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; Teaching them to observe
whatsoever I have commanded you; (not what your selves without my command, much
less Popes, Priests, Prelates shall of their own heads prescribe) That this
was their principal commission, charge, office; is further evidenced Acts 2. 4.
42, 46, 47. c. 3. c. ^ 1, 2, 18, 19, 33, c. 5. 28, 29, 42. c. 19. 8, 9, 10. c.
20. 20, 31, c. 28. 30, 31. Col. 1. 5, 6, 23 Rom 10. 18. c. 15. 19, 20.
by the Apostles daily constant preaching to the people, both in the Temple,
Synagogues, and from house to house, notwithstanding the High Priests and
Councels inhibitions not to preach; choosing rather to obey God then men: By St.
Paul's separation and mission to preach the Gospel; the necessity laid upon him,
and 1 Cor: 9. 14. to 24. Romans 1. 1, 2. Gal. 1. 16 Ephesians: 3. 8. 2. Cor 10. 14, 16.
1 Thessalonians. 2. 9. Act. 20. 20. c. 28. 30, 31.
woe that would fall on him, if he did not preach it; And his dreadful charge
to Timothy, (and in him to all Bishops and Ministers of the Gospel) 2 Timothy: 4.
1, 2.
I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge both the
quick and dead at his appearing and his kingdom; Preach the Word; be instant in
season, out of season, rebuke, reprove, (in and by the word preached) exhort
with all long-suffering and doctrine. In all this Grand commission, there is
only a Ministration, not the least Domination or Jurisdiction delegated to
Peter, or any other Apostle, Evangelist, Bishop, Priest, or Minister
whatsoever: Yea, it is observable, That Popes and Prelates of the Church, who
most contend for Jurisdiction, do most neglect this most essential prime part
of their Commission, and relinquish it to inferior Priests, Ministers,
Curates, to whom they deny the power of Jurisdiction.

The third Commission whereon the Pope and his flatterers principally erect St.
Peter's and their absolute Ecclesiastical Sovereign Supremacy over all other
Apostles, Ministers, Priests, Kings, Emperors, Kingdoms, and Catholic Church
on Earth; and upon which all Bishops, Presbyters, Priests do bottom their
pretended divine Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over Emperors, Kings, and all
Secular persons, as appropriate to their functions, consistories, and
incommunicable to Princes or Laymen; is, that which was generally given by
Christ to all the Apostles, yea to private Christians and Laymen, and the
whole Church, before Christ's passion, Mat. 18. 18. Verily I say unto you,
whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye
shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven. Thus renewed, confirmed to all
the Apostles by Christ in behalf of the whole Church, after his resurrection in
other words; Jesus breathed on the Disciples and said, John 20. 22. 23
Receive ye the holy Ghost; whosoever sins ye remit, they are remitted; and
whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained. Which Commission, though thus
twice jointly given to all the Apostles alike by Christ; yet because he first
granted this commission to them, directing his speech personally to Peter, Mat:
16. 18, 19. I say unto thee, thou art Peter, etc. And I WILL (not now do) give
unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shall loose
on earth shall be loosed in heaven, and whatsoever thou shall bind on earth,
shall be bound in heaven. Popes and Popish writers thence conclude St. Peter's
and others Universal Supremacy over the whole Church, and all other Apostles
and Bishops whatsoever as well as Kings and Emperors.

I answer, That these Commissions (if rightly examined) do neither give St.
Peter nor his pretended Successors, nor any Prelates or Ecclesiastical persons
such an inherent Supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, distinct from the Regal
and Temporal, and incommunicable to Lay persons, as is pretended.

For 1. Every particular person, though a Lay man, or private Christian, has
an absolute power, yea special command from Christ himself, to pardon, forgive
and remit sins, and offenses committed against himself: as this clause in the
Lords Prayer, Mat: 6. 13, 14, 15. c. 28. 15, to 22. Lu: 6. 37. c. 11. 4, 6.
Mar. 11. 25, 26.
Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us; These
precepts When ye pray standing forgive; for if ye forgive their Trespasses,
your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their
trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you your trespasses;
Forgive and you shall be forgiven; Ephesians: 4. 32. 2 Cor. 2. 7, 10, 11.
Forgive one another, as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you, with other
Scriptures demonstrate. And as they may thus pardon, loose, and forgive: so
they may likewise bind, or retain sins and trespasses against them, when the
parties are obstinate and impenitent. This is evident by Luke 17. 3, 4. If thy
brother trespass against thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, forgive him: And
if he trespass against thee seven times a day, and seven times in a day return
unto thee, saying I repent, thou shall forgive him, (but not without
repentance:) Compared with 2 Thessalonians: 3. 14, 15. Rom: 16. 17, 18. 1 Cor: 5. 11,
12, 13, and Mat: 18. 15, 16, 17. Moreover, if thy brother trespass against
thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he shall hear
thee, thou have gained thy brother: But if he will not hear thee, then take
with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three Witnesses every
word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the
Church; and if he shall neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee (mark
it, not them) as an heathen man, and a publican; Verily I say unto you,
whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye
shall loose in earth, shall be loosed in heaven. Therefore the self-same
Commission, Authority of binding and loosing upon earth is given to every
private person in this Original Text by Christ, as was given to Peter, Mat: 16.
18, 19. and to all the Apostles, John 20. 22, 23. Hence De Verbis Domini
secund. Mat. Sermo 16.
St. Augustine resolves, Cum caepisti habere fratrem tuum tanquam Publicanum,
Ligis illum in terra, cum autem corrigeris and concordaveris cum fratre tuo,
solvisti illum in terra Cum solveris in terra, solutus erit in coelo: Enarratio
in Mat. cap. 18. p. 45.
Theophylact is yet more punctual; Si tu offensum eum habes eum qui te affecit
injuria, sicut Publicanum and Gentilem, erit ille et in coelo talis. Si autem
solveris eum, hoc est, si illi condonaveris, erit illi et in coelo condonatum.
Non enim solum quae solvunt Sacerdotes sunt soluta, sed quae cunque nos et
iniuria assecti, vel ligamus vel solvimus, et ipsa erum ligata et soluta. And
if every private person may thus bind and loose as well as Priests, as these
two Fathers, together with Defense of the Apology, 2 part cap. 6. div: 2. p.
176, 177.
Bishop Jewel and others resolve; then much more may Kings and Supreme temporal
Magistrates do it, in their Courts and Consistories. Our Venerable In cap. 5
Jacobi.

Scotus, with other Popish Schoolmen, yea their Gratian De Poenit: Did. 1.

Canon Law, and Canonists resolve; That in the absence or want of a Priest, a
man may confess his sins to his coequal or neighbout, yea open his daily and
lesser sins to his neighbor, where there is a Priest, and receive absolution
from him though a Layman, as well as from a Priest. And that they may do so
even by divine Institution, is most fully demonstrated by Jam: 5. 16. (written
to the twelve Tribes scattered abroad) who are thus admonished; Confess your
faults one to another, (not to a Pope, Bishop, Priest) and pray for one
another, that ye may be healed; from which Text not only many Ancients, but
Jewel, Mousin Chamier, Chemnitius, Willet, Fulk, Field, White, and others of
Confession.
most Orthodox Protestant Divines resolve; That no private christian (in point
of conscience) is obliged to confess his sins to a Priest, any more then to
another private Christian, and Laymen no more obliged to confess their sins to
Priests, then Priests are to confess their sins to Laymen; and that this text
makes the duty of confessing their sins, faults one to another reciprocal,
being coupled with mutual praying for one another; the Bishop, Priest being
bound to pray for the people, as well as the people for the Bishop or Priest;
therefore to confess unto them, as far forth as they are to confess to him.

2ly. I answer, That the power of binding and loosing, retaining and remitting
public or scandalous sins, is not given to Peter, the Apostles, Popes,
Bishops, Priests or Ecclesiastical persons, as an inherent privilege and
jurisdiction peculiar to them alone, but to the whole Church and congregation,
to whom the right and execution thereof principally appertains. This is
infallibly demonstrated, by Mat. 18. 17. If he shall neglect to hear them, tell
it to the Church or Congregation; and if he shall neglect to hear the Church,
let him be unto thee (not the Church) as an heathen man, and a publican; This
word Church or Congregation, is never taken throughout the Scripture for any
one particular person, whether High Priest, Priest Apostle, Bishop or
Presbyter, nor yet for two, three, or more Apostles, Bishops, Priests,
Ministers, assembled together without, or as contradistinct from the Laity; but
ever for the whole Church or congregation either as conjoined with the
Apostles, Bishops, Ministers, and sometimes without them, for Lay christians
alone, as severed from their Bishops and Pastors; particularly in these signal
Texts, Acts 15. 3, 4, 5. And when Paul, Barnabas, and other of them were come
to Jerusalem, they were received of the Church, and of the Apostles and Elders,
being brought on their way by the Church, And he went through Syria and Cilicia
confirming the Churches. Acts 14. 23, 27. And when they had ordained them
Elders in every Church, they commended them to the Lord. And when they were
come to Antioch, and had gathered the Church together, they rehearsed all that
God had done with them; which Church is styled the multitude gathered together;
(not Bishops or Priests) Acts 15. 30. c. 16. 5. So were the Churches
established in the faith. c. 20. 17. 28. And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus,
and called the Elders of the Church, (not Elders the Church.) And then gave
them this charge; Take heed to your selves, and to all the flock over which the
holy Ghost has made you Bishops; to feed the Church, (distinguished from the
Bishops feeding them) which he has purchased with his own blood. Acts 21. 18,
to 25. The day following Faul went in with us to James, and all the Elders were
present: And when he had saluted them, and they heard his relation, and what
was reported of him by the Jewish Proselytes, they concluded; The Multitude or
Church must needs come together to hear the business; put in distinction from
James and the Elders of the Church at Jerusalem. Rom: 16. 16. The Churches of
Christ salute you. Gaius my host, and of the whole Church saluteth you. Thus
the words, Church and Churches are used 1 Cor. 1. 2, 3. c. 7. 17. c. 11. 16.
18. c. 12. 28. c. 14. 4. 23, 33, 34. c. 16. 1. 5. 2 Cor: 1. 1. c. 8. 18, 19,
23, 24. c. 11. 8. 28. c. 12, 13 Gal: 1. 19. 22. Ephesians: 4. 11, 13. c. 5. 25, 27,
32. Col. 4, 15. 1 Timothy: 5. 16. 1 Thessalonians. 1. 1. c. 2. 14. c. 5. 27, 2. 2 Thessalonians: 1.
1, 4. 2 Timothy 3. 2, 4, 5. A Bishop must be one that rules his own house well;
For if he knows not how to rule his own house, how shall be take care of (not
rule) the Church of God? Here put as distinct from him. Iam: 5. 14. Let him
call for the Elders of the Church. 1. John 3 v: 9, 10. I wrote unto the Church;
but Diotrephes who loves to have the pre-eminence among them, receives not
us, nor the brethren, and casts them our of the Church. Rev: 1. 20. The seven
Stars are the Angels of the seven Churches, and the Candlesticks are the seven
Churches; distinguished from them. Rev: 2. 1. 11, etc. c: 3. 1. 6. 13. 22, etc.
The Angel of the Church of Ephesus, Pergamos, and the other 5. Asian Churches,
interpreted to be the Ministers of Bishops of them, are distinguished from the
people, who are styled always the Church of Ephesus, etc. but the Angel,
Bishop, or Ministers thereof, whether singly or jointly considered, are never
once styled the Church throughout the New Testament or Old: Therefore tell the
Church, never signifies St. Peter, or the Pope, (a single person only, and so

Council only in the New Testament, and no divine institution) but only the
particular congregation or Church collectively considered, whereof the person
offending was a member. And if meant of it, or of the Jews Sanhedrim or
Council; St. Peter, and the Pope, with his Conclave of Cardinals, being no such
Council or Church, (consisting of the Princes of the Tribes of Israel, and 72
Laymen) not of Priests alone, and no Successors to them by Divine institution;
the Jewish State, Priesthood, Church, ceremonies, being totally abolished by
Christ; the Pope and other Prelates can pray in no aid from this much wrested,
abused, mistaken Text, to support their pretended Supremacy, and divine
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction: (principally vested in the whole Church) which is
to rebuke, loose, seclude, retain or absolve penitent or impenitent scandalous
sinners, as St. Paul himself resolves, 1 Cor: 5. throughout. When ye are
gathered together in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such a one
to Satan. Purge out therefore the old leven, that ye may be a new Lump. Do not
ye judge them that are within? Therefore put away from Your selves that wicked
person: spoken to and of the whole Church of Corinth, not to the Ministers of
Elders thereof. 2 Cor: 2. 6, 7. Sufficient for such a man is this censure
inflicted by many, (the whole Church, not the Apostle, Pope, Bishop) So that
contrariwise, ye ought rather to forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a
one should be swallowed up of grief; Wherefore I beseech you, that you would
confirm your love toward him. To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also. 2 Thessalonians: 3. 14. If any man obey not our Epistle, note ye that man, and have no
company with him, that he may be ashamed. Rom: 16. 17. Now I beseech you
brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the
doctrines ye have heard, and avoid them. 2 Timothy: 3. 5. From such turn away. All
directed to the Church, Saints, Brethren, (not the Bishops or Ministers of the
Church) in whom the power of the Keys, of binding and loosing originally
resides, and in them only ministerially as servants of and to the Church:
Whence In ^ohann. Tract 124.
St: Augustine thus determines, Cum Christus Petro diceret, tibi dabo claves
Regni caelorum, Vniversam significabat Ecclesiam: Whereupon in the Primitive
Church, sinners and penitent persons desired the prayers, pardon and absolution
of the whole Church, and all the Members of it when they were restored to it,

3dly. This binding and loosing, remitting and retaining sins, was not by any
judicial sentence pronounced by the Apostles in any Consistory Court where they
sat as Supreme Judges, as Popes, and other Prelates since have done; the
Apostles having no such Courts, nor exercising such a Sovereign Jurisdiction in
them, as these since have done, for which In Mat. cap: 16.
St: Jerome thus sharply reprehends them; Istum locum Episcopi and Presbyt^ri
non intelligentes, aliquid sibi de Pharisaeorum assumunt supercilio, ut vel
damnent innocents, vel solvere se noxios arbitrentur, cum apud Deum, non
sententia Sacerdotum, sed reorum vita ponderatur. Alligat and solvit Episcopus
vel Presbyter eos qui insontes sunt, vel noxii; sed pro officio suo cum
peccatorum audierit varietates, scit qui ligandus sit, qui solvendus etc: That
is, as 4 Sentent. D^st: 18. cap. (...).
Peter Lombard interprets it, Dominus tribuit S^cerditibus potestatem Ligandi
and Solvendi, id est, ostendendi hominibus Ligatos and Solvendos; in and by the
preaching of the Gospel to them; according to Christ's commission; He that
repents, believes and is baptized, shall be saved; here is the loosing and
remitting; He that repents not nor believes, shall be damned; and the wrath
of God abides on him; here is the binding and retaining; by the keys of the
kingdom of heaven, to wit, the Gospel, which shuts and opens heaven gates,
admits or excludes, inherits or disinherits them of it; and is the savor of
life unto life to those who believe it, but the savor of death unto death to
those who believe it not; as is evident by Mar: 16. 16. Lu: 13. 3. 5. John 3.

Answer to the J(...) Cha^^^nge.
4ly. This power of binding, retaining, loosing and remitting sins, with the
keys of the kingdom of heaven whereby this is done, were equally given to all
the Apostles, as far forth as to Peter; Christ's words, I will give to thee
the keys of the Kingdom of heaven, etc. being in the future, not present
tense; giving him no actual possession of the keys, kingdom of heaven til after
Christ's ascension, and then but jointly with the rest of the Apostles, In Mat.
tract. 1.
John 20. 21, 22, 23. Yea every ordinary Minister, Presbyter, Priest, has as
large a divine power in the Keys, as the Pope himself, or the greatest
Patriarch, Archbishop, Bishop in the world; and may as absolutely, fully bind,
loose, absolve, retain men's sins as they, their Commissions being all one and
the same; and their power herein, not judicial, but merely ministerial,
declaratory, not definitive, the absolute judicial power of shutting and
opening heaven, pardoning, remitting, retaining sins, and absolving, condemning
sinners, being peculiar to God and Christ alone as Isay 22. 22. Rev. 3. 7. Mat.

Alphonso de Castro concludes, (though a great champion for the Pope) Quando
absolvit simplex Sacerdos, tantum adsolvit de Culpa sicut Papa. Therefore if
these Texts give any Supreme Ecclesiastical Authority over Kings and the whole
Church to St. Peter, or the Pope; they give the very same to every Priest,
Curate whatsoever; and so we shall have as many Popes, yea Vicars generals and
Viceroyes of Christ over the Church, all Christian Kings, Emperors, and their
kingdoms, as there are Priests.

5ly. I have long admired, how any Pope or Prelate from this borrowed Metaphor
of the Keys of the Kingdom of heaven given to Peter or others, can pretend to
such a transcendent Sovereign Ecclesiastical and Temporal Jurisdiction, too, as
some of them claim from thence; Since I never read in any Text, Story, That
Keys were an Emblem of Supreme Jurisdiction, but the Romans 13. 4.

Scepter only; which belongs not unto Apostles, Popes, Prelates, Priests, but
Kings alone: And experience informs us, that Porters who keep the keys, and
open, shut the gates of Kings, Popes, Bishops, Noblemens Palaces, Cities,
Colleges, Castles, Courts; and other public or private Baylifs, Stewards,
Butlers, Grooms, who keep the keys of their Lords, Masters Barns, Butteries,
Sellers, Stables, are persons of inferior quality, void of any Supreme
Temporal or Ecclesiastical Authority in or over their fellow Servants, much
less over their Lords, Masters, to shut them out or let them in at their
pleasures: Therefore every of these Porters, Key-keepers, yea every parish
Clerk, who keeps the keys of the Church, Cathedral, or of the Popes own
palace at Rome, may as justly challenge a Supreme Temporal and Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction over their Kings, Lords, Popes, Bishops, Parish Priests,
Parishioners, Churches themselves, as the Pope, Priests and Prelates do, from
St. Peter's keys; because they keep the keys, and open the doors to let them
in and out of their Palaces, Churches; Houses; yea the Door-keepers, and
Turn-keyes of both Houses of Parliament may as well argue they are above the
Houses, Members themselves in power and jurisdiction upon the same Account, as
Popes above the Church and Kings.

flatterers, to appropriate those Keys to St. Peter and the Romish Hierarchy,
which Christ himself never knew nor gave them, have made up a New Bundle of
Keys in their own forge, which will never shut nor open the gates of heaven:
As first, the Key of Power; 2ly. Of Jurisdiction; 3ly. Of Order; 4ly. Of
Discretion; 5ly. The Keys most principal; 6ly. The Keys less principal;
7ly. The Keys of Knowledge; Which though chief 4 Sententiarum Distinct: 18. qu.

Clavis non est de esse Ordinis, sed de been esse.
Bonaventura confesses, most of their Ordinary Mass Priests want, being so
ignorant, that they are utterly void of all true saving knowledge of the sacred
Scriptures. Most of these Keys, Gratian, Distinct: 10. 21. 22. Alvarus
Pelagius De Planctu Eccles: lib. 1. Artic: 37, 51, 53, 55, 56, etc.
they appropriate to the Pope originally, and from him derivatively to Bishops.
But since they have not in all their New Bunch of Keys, The Key of Faith, and
knowledge of the word of God, which only opens heavens gate; and since the gate
of heaven is very strait, and but one, and so needs not such a multiplicity of
Keys, or pick-locks to open it as the Bishop Jewels Defense of the Apology,
part 2. divis: 6, 7. p. 182, 183. etc.
Roman Porters have forged; yea the broad gate of hell but one, which stands
open day and night to let in prisoners, who can never return back thence; as I
may conclude with De Subditis and Superioribus.
John Veselius on the one hand, Claves Papae and Praelatorum non aperiunt
Regnum Dei, sed abscondunt; So I may resolve on the other, That they give them
no Supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction at all over any Churches, Christians,
much less over Kings and Emperors, for the premised reasons.

Peter and the Pope, See Bern. de l. 2. c. 3. Stat ergo inconcussum privilegium

treble denying of him with an Oath, John 20. 15, 16, 17. Jesus said unto Simon
Peter, Love thou me more then these? He said, Yea Lord, thou know that I
love thee. He says unto him, Feed my Lambs, Feed my Sheep, Feed my Sheep. From

Cardinals, Priests, but over all Christian Kings, Emperors, Princes, not only
to feed, but to excommunicate, depose, kill them; divide, or give their Crowns,

To which I answer 1. That the High Priests and Priests in the Old Testament
were obliged by their office, duty to feed, teach and instruct their flocks, as
well as St. Peter and the Apostles under the New: as is largely resolved (with
much expostulation by God himself against those who neglected it) Jer: 23. 1,
to 16. Ezech: 34. 2. to 24. Zech: 11. 7. 2 Chronicles: 17. 7, 8, 9. Neh. 8. 7. c. 7.
15. and other Texts. But the High Priests under the Law claimed no such
Sovereignty or Jurisdiction over the people: much less over Moses, Joshua,
Supreme temporal Magistrates, or their Kings, by this their pastoral charge,
power, to feed Gods sheep and flock; as I have See here, p. 5, 6. Bishop Jewels
Defense of the Apology, 8 part. chapter 1. divis. 4. p. 711, 712.
formerly proved, and shall here further illustrate by the example of Aaron the
first High Priest; who was subject and subordinate to Moses the Israelites
first chief Civil Governor, being no Priest by birthright, nor consecration,
as See here p. 9. Hardings Reply to Jewel.

elder Brother by 3 years, and so the only Priest by birthright, and the high
Priest by Exodus: 40. 12, to 17. Here, p. 5. Bishop Carlton of Jurisdiction

Moses special consecration; who at his death Number. 20. 25. to 29.
stripped him of his high priests robes, and put them on Eleazar his son. 2ly.
Because he never consecrated himself a Priest, as he did Aaron and his sons,
nor was he ever consecrated a Priest by others. 3ly. Because Levit: 10. 16, to
20.
he never offered burnt offerings or sacrifices, nor intermedled with the
proper office of the Priests, but charged them alone to do it. 4ly. Because the
word Priest in Psalm: 99. 6. 9. whence they would conclude Moses a Priest,
signifies as well a 1 Samuel 8. 18. 1 Chronicles. 18 17. Exodus 2. 16. Genesis 47. 22. 26
Prince as a Priest, and therefore cannot conclude him a Priest, but Prince
among them. Now though Aaron was high Priest, and Moses his younger brother,
yet Aaron was subject to his Jurisdiction, Power, Censure; as these 2.
Scriptures evidence. First Moses particularly Number. 12. 1. to 16.
reprehended Aaron and the Priests for burning and not eating the sin-offering
in the holy place, according to their duty and Gods prescription; for which
Aaron made his Apology to him. 2ly. Number. 1^. 11
By Gods anger against Aaron, and smiting his Sister Miriam with Leprosy, only
for speaking against Moses for marying an Ethiopian woman, and using these
seditious words against him; Has the Lord only spoken by Moses? has he not
also spoken by us? in derogation of his Authority. 4ly. By Aarons confessing of
his sin, and craving pardon of him for it in this submissive manner, Alas, In
Veteri lege Sacerdotium indignius erat Potestate Regia and ei subjectum
Johannis de Parisiiis, De Potest. Regia and Papali, c. 5.
My Lord, I beseech thee lay not this sin upon us; Levit. 10. 14. to 20.
wherein we have dealt foolishly. 5ly. By Aarons intercession to Moses for
Miriam after God had smitten her with Leprosy, and then healed her upon his
prayer; that she might not be put out of the Camp; Which Moses refused to
grant, shutting her out of the Camp seven days ere he restored her: Seeing
then this Pastoral office of feeding advanced not Aaron above Moses, to whom he
was high Priest; who continued (l) subject to his Supreme Ecclesiastical and
Civil Jurisdiction; How Christ's command to Peter to feed his Sheep, can elevate
his pretended Successors above Kings, Emperors, and all other Bishops, no
rational Christian can discern.

2ly. Every Apostle, Minister, Priest, Bishop in and under the Gospel is
expressly enjoined and bound ex officio, to feed Christ's sheep, lambs, flock
committed to his charge, as well as Peter: as is evident by this question and
demand of God himself, Ezech: 34. 2. Should not the Shepherds feed the Flocks?
which infallibly intimates, that they should and ought to do it under the
Gospel as well as Law: by Jer: 11. 15. I will give you Pastors after mine own
heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. Jer: 23. 4. And I
will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them; both meant of the times
of the Gospel; by these express Gospel Texts Acts 20. 28. where Paul gave this
strict charge to all the Elders and Bishops of Ephesus, Takeheed therefore unto
your selves, and to all the Flock over which the holy Ghost has made you
Bishops (to what end?) to feed the Church of God, which he has purchased with
his own blood; Which words, Feed the Church of God, are certainly as universal,
as Feed my sheep, feed my Lambs: 1 Cor: 9. 7. Who Feeds a Flock and eats
not of the milk thereof? applied by St. Paul to all Ministers and Preachers of
the Gospel, who ought to live of the Gospel. Yea, (which is most observable;)
St. Peter himself (as if he had purposely foreseen his pretended Successors
ambitious Monopoly; and claim of Feeding Christ's Sheep to himself, to erect a
new Monarchy, tyranny over them, by a prophetical Spirit, and purposely writ
against it) for ever refutes their pretenses in this memorable passage, 1 Pet.
5. 1, to 5. The Elders that are among you I exhort (...), ut Compresbyter, or
Consenior, (as the Vulgar, Jerome, Arias Montanus, and other Latin Translations
render it) as your fellow Elder, (yea fellow-shepherd too) (not chief Head,
Pastor, Feeder of the Universal Church of Christ) (...), feed the Flock of God
which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but
willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; (...): not as Lords over
(or, as Domineering and ruling over) the Lords heritage, but being ensamples to
the flock; And when the Chief Shepherd (acknowledged by Peter himself after
Christ's Resurrection to be Christ alone, not himself) shall appear, ye shall
receive a Crown of glory that fades not away. Whence St. Peter expressly
enjoynes them to feed the flock as Shepherds only, not as Kings or Lords over
them.

3ly. Christ himself John 10. 14.
the good, Hebr. 13. 20.
Great, 1 Pet: 5. 3.
Chief Shepherd of his sheep, informs us; that as he himself, so every other
John 10. 1, to 5.
good shepherd that enters in by the door, does not only guard, but feed his
sheep, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and
leads them out, and he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they
know his voice. Every Apostle, Bishop, Minister of the Gospel is as much a
Shepherd of Christ's sheep, as Peter; therefore bound to feed Christ's sheep,
Lambs as much as he. This St: De dignitate Sacerd. cap. 2.
Ambrose long since asserted: Dominus dixit Petro, Pasce oves meas; Quas oves,

St. Basil goes a little further to his Keys as well as feeding. Petre inquit,

ipse Dominus Simoni sic dixit: Diligis me? respondit; Diligo: ait ei, Pasce
oves meas, Hoc verbum factum ex actu ipso quo cessit cognoscimus, and caeteri
Discipuli similiter fecerunt, Nolumus ergo fratres devotissimi vos mercenarios
inveniri, sed bonos Pastores, etc. Resolving every Apostle, Bishop, Minister,
to be as much Pastors, and as far bound to feed Christ's sheep as Peter.
Therefore if this gave Peter a Sovereign Jurisdiction over all the Church, and
Kings themselves, it must give the like to all other Bishops, Priests,
Ministers; and so we shall have as many Popes, Vicars Generals, and Supreme
heads of the Church of Christ paramount all Kings and Emperors, as there are
Priests and Bishops.

4ly. The sheep thus fed; are not St. Peter's, nor any Popes; Bishops sheep that
feeds them; but only the Psalm: 100. 3. Psalm: 79. 13. John 10. 2, to 26. Acts
20. 28. Jer: 23. and Ezech: 34. John 21. 16.
sheep, flock of Jesus Christ, for whom he has laid down his life, yea
purchased, redeemed them with his own most precious blood. Therefore their bare
feeding of can give them no dominion or Sovereign Jurisdiction over them, no
more then it does to any Ordinary country Shepherd which feeds, keeps, folds
his Lords or Masters sheep, who can neither shear, sell, thrust them out of the
fold, pasture, nor kill or dispose of them at his pleasure; but only guard,
feed, fold, carefully watch over and lead them into such pastures as his Lord
prescribes: his shepherds office being only a painful, Genesis 31. 39. 40.
careful Service, Ministry, not a Dominion or Dignity.

5ly. All the acts, duties of St: Peter's or any other Apostles, Bishops,
Ministers Pastoral office in relation to Christ's flock are merely servile,
ministerial toward their sheep for their preservation and welfare, not Lordly
or Jurisdictional: as namely,

1. To Psalm. 23. 2. Isa. 40. 11. Acts 20 28. Genesis 29 2, to 18. Ezech. 34, 14,
16, 18.
water and feed them in good, green pastures, with the wholesome food of Gods
word. 2ly. To Gen: 31. 29, 30. Lu. 2. 8. Ezech. 34: 2, to 10. John 10. 2, to 12.
watch over them day and night; and guard them from Wolves, Thieves, Robbers
that would devour, kill, seduce, destroy them. 3ly. To 1 Pet: 5. 2, 3. John 10.
3, 4, 5
go in and out before them in an holy and exemplary conversation. 4ly. To
Ezech. 34. 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 16. Ps. 119. 76 Isay 53. 6. Jer. 50. 6. 17. Mat.
15. 24, c. 18. 12, 13. Lu: 15. 4, 5.
gather them together when they are scattered by any persecutions, Wolves,
casualties, and to seek them out and bring them home to their fold and pasture,
when they are strayed thence. 5ly. To John 10. 10. to 16, 1 Samuel: 17, 34, 35.
stand by them in their greatest dangers without flying, and to lay down their
lives for their safety and defense against Wolves and Robbers. 6ly. To Isay 40.
11. Ezech. 34. 4. to 17. Numb. 32. 16.
gather the Lambs with their arms and carry them in their bosoms; to lead those
gently that are with young, to bind them up which are broken, and to heal and
strengthen them that are sick. 7ly. To fold and make them lie down in safety.
8ly. Ezech 34. 4, to 7. John 10. 10, to 15. 1 Pet. 5. 2. Psalm. 44. 11.
Not to feed themselves instead of the flock, by eating the fat, or clothing
themselves with their wool, nor yet to kill, starve or fly from them, nor to
rule them with fear, force, cruelty, as Lords over them; nor to use and call
them out as sheep appointed for the slaughter, as Popes use to do. Wherefore
none of all these Pastoral positive duties importing the least Dominion or
Jurisdiction over Christ's sheep, but only a ministry and service toward, for
them, accompanied with an heavy woe and account if neglected; and the Negative
part, expressly prohibits all Lordly Dominion and Jurisdiction over them; How
Popes, Prelates or Priests can hence conclude any Supreme Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction over Christ's Church and flock to be vested in themselves alone,
(not in Kings) (who are to feed, rule them by way of Government and
Jurisdiction as Kings, but not as mere spiritual shepherds) transcends my
apprehension. Yet hear what Quest: 3. nu. 14, 15, 16.

it as well with detestation, as admiration; The Pope as Shepherd, who is to
feed Christ's sheep, has his Dogs; (And who are they?) Hi canes intelliguntur
partim Reges et Imperatores, These Dogs (of this proud shepherd) are partly
Kings and Emperors; (they must be no longer Sheep, but Currs.) Then descanting
upon these their honorable Royal Titles: Igitur hi Canes, These Dogs
therefore if they be watchful, they must be ready at the Shepherds hand: but
if they be lazy, madd or troublesome, the Shepherd must presently remove them.
This He teaches; this the Council of Lateran decrees. He subjoynes; Christian
Kings are Sheep, are Rams, are Wolves, and are Dogs: (though Christ and St:
Peter never made such distinctions of them) Whence it is that the Pope bears
himself in a diverse manner toward them. As they are Sheep, if they be silly,
he may put them out of the fold: As they are Rams, if they be troublesome and
push with their horns, (against his Miter) he may shut them up: As they are
Wolves he may drive them away: Quatenus Canes, as they are Dogs, he may put
them from their office, if they be defective therein: and some of these he does
by Excommunication, others by Deposition. Thus Becanus concludes, against Gods,
the Prophet Jeremiahs, Ezechiels, Christ's, and St: Peter's own Glosses and
Resolutions on this Pasce oves meas: metamorphosing sheep, but specially Kings,
Emperors who are such, into Dogs, Wolves allegorically, and the Pope the
pretended Chief shepherd into both, really and practically, to his eternal
infamy.

6ly. If these Commissions to Saint Peter will not evidence the Popes Supremacy
over other Bishops, Priests, Kings and Emperors, yet there is one Commission
more will certainly effect and conclude it without dispute, Acts 10. 10, to 17
where Peter falling into a trance, saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel let
down unto him like a great sheet, knit at four corners, let down to the earth;
wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth (therefore sheep
amongst the rest) and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fouls of the air;
and there came a voice unto him; Rise Peter, kill and eat. But Peter said, Not
so Lord, for I have never eaten that which was common or unclean: And the voice
spoke again unto him the second time; What God has cleansed, that call not thou
common. This was done thrice, and the Vessel was received again into heaven.

some Romish Parasites, Janissaries conclude from Surge Petre, macta and
manduca, by their own Chemical Divinity, per quod innuitur quod Petrus
Praelatus fuit populis Vniversis, vas autem illud orbem universum signat, et
universitas contentum in eo significat; tam Judaeorum quam Gentilium Nationes;
yea some of them assert, the lawfulness of the Popes deposing and murdering
Christian Kings, Princes, by his assassinates from this Text.

I answer, first: That Arise Peter, kill and eat, if meant of sheep, is very
ill coupled with, Simon, feed my sheep; being directly contrary to his pastoral
duty and office, Ezech. 34, 3, to 6. John 10. 1, to 6. 2ly. There were no
Kings, Emperors, nor men at all in this vessel, but only four-footed beasts,
creeping things and fowls, which God provided for the food of man, and gave all
men as free power to kill and eat, as he did here to Peter; Genesis 9, 2, 3, 4.
Levit. 11. 2, 3, 9. Deuter. 14. 4. How then that which is the common privilege
of all mankind to kill and eat such beasts, can be a peculiar Supremacy in
Peter alone; Or how Kings, Emperors, men, can be intended or typified in or by
these beasts, or eaten by St. Peter, like beasts, fouls and creeping things, to
advance Peter's pretended Supremacy; or how Peter's spurious Successors can be
enabled by this Text to depose, excommunicate, kill and eat the flesh of Kings,
Emperors, men, whereas God himself when he first gave Commission to Noah and
Mankind to kill and eat of every beast of the earth, creeping thing, fowl of
the air, and fish of the sea, Genesis 9. 2, to 8.
prohibited them to kill or eat the flesh of any man, threatening to require the
blood of the life of every man at his brothers hand; without making St. Peter
and his Successors Canibals and Murderers; yea beasts and fowls instead of men;
(whom God only commissioned to eat the flesh of Kings, Captains, mighty men,
free and bond, Rev. 19. 17, 18.) I cannot discern. 3ly. St. Peter
notwithstanding this invitation, (not simple command) did Acts 10. 14, 15, 16.
neither kill nor eat any of these beasts, fowls, but absolutely refused to do
it; whereupon they were taken up again into heaven, as the Text relates. How
then come his pretended Successors, both to kill and eat, when he refused to do
either? and to ground their Supremacy thereon? It seems they are now more
hungry and voracious then St. Peter was then. 4ly. This whole History was no
reality, but a Acts 10. 10, 11.
mere trance and vision, wherein was a mixture of all sorts of beasts,
creatures, as well clean as unclean by the Levit. 11. 2. etc. Deuteronomy. 14. 4
Levitical Law; which beasts and fowls Peter then conceived he might not
lawfully eat: Now the end of this vision was double; First to instruct Peter,
Col. 2. 14, 15, 16. 21, 22. 1 Cor. 8. 9. Romans 14. 14. 1 Timothy 4. 4, 5. 1 Cor.
10. 25. to 31.
that the Levitical Law putting a difference between unclean and clean beasts,
was then totally abolished, and all of them to be freely eaten by Jews as well
as Gentiles. 2. That the Acts 10. 19, 20, 34, 35, 45, 46, 47. c. 11. 2, to 19.
Ephesians. 2. 13, to 18.
Gentiles were now as holy and dear unto God as the Jews, Christ having broken
down the wall of partition that was between them; as the sequel of that Chapter
and Peter himself relates, chap: 11. Now how this vision only to inform and
instruct St. Peter's judgment in these two particulars, can give him or the
Pope such a Sovereign Jurisdiction, as they by head and shoulders deduce from
it, let all rational men resolve.

The 7th. Commission the Sea Marsilius Patavinus Defens. Pacis, l. 2. c. 3.
Pontificians have found out given by Christ to Peter, is that of Matthew. 21. 2,
3. Then sent Jesus two Disciples (whereof the Romanists averr Peter to be one)
saying unto them, Go ye into the village over against you, and straight way ye
shall find an Ass tied, and a colt with her: Loose them and bring them unto me.
And if any say ought unto you, ye shall say, the Lord has need of them, and
straightway they will send them. And the Disciples went and did as Jesus
commanded them. From whence they infer, that the Pope has power to bind,
loose, excommunicate and depose Kings, Emperors, absolve their Subjects from
their Allegiance, and take away their Crowns, kingdoms from them, when (he
their Lord) has need of them (as he did King John's and others) as Peter did
thus loose and take away the Ass, Colt, and bring them unto Christ.

I Answer First; That it appears not by any story that Peter was one of those
two Disciples that loosed and brought away this Ass and Colt to Christ. 2ly.
Admit he was, yet he had another disciple equally joined with him in
Commission; which destroys his sole Monarchy and Supremacy. 3ly. They went not
about this errand till Christ gave them a special Commission for it; But Popes
run in a quite contrary errand, to depose Kings and Emperors before they are
sent by Christ, yea against his express inhibition. 4ly. They did not take
them away without the owners consent, but with it, as the words straightway
they will send them imply: Whereas Popes depose and take away Kings and
Emperors Crowns, kingdoms, and absolve their Subjects from their Allegiance
against their wills. 5ly. Christ did not send them to take away the propriety,
but only to borrow the use of this Ass and Colt, at this very instant, (not
the Crowns, Scepters, or kingdoms of Though he rode as a King into Jerusalem.
Kings) and that only for his necessary use for a few hours, even then when he
rode like a King, in greatest trimph he ever used on earth, into Jerusalem, and
then sent them back. Popes do not borrow, but forcibly seize, detain not the
Asses or Horses of Kings, Emperors, but their Crowns, and kingdoms too; which
Christ never commissioned, nor sent Peter, or any other Disciples to demand or
take from Kings, and bring them unto him. 6ly. Those Disciples were sent only
to loose a mere natural Ass and Colt for Christ to ride upon, not Emperors,
Kings, Princes, on whose backs Christ never rode, on whose heads, crowns he
never trampled, whiles prostrate at his feet, as Antichristian Sacrar. Ceremon.

Popes have frequently done; neither had he Emperors or Kings to hold his
stirrup, bridle, when he ascended on the Asses back, as Popes have made
Emperors and Kings to hold theirs. 7ly. No argument for the Popes Supremacy can
be deduced hence, but only that Peter was here an Asse-driver, not a Shepherd;
that his Keys were now transformed into a halter or Psalm. 32. 3. Prove. 26. 3.

Gastar Schioppius is not ashamed with greatest impudency directly to proclaim
to all the world, in this most scurrillous passage, in allusion to this Text.
Ecclesia est Mandra, sive Grex aut multitudo jumentorum, sive Aunorum
clitellariorum seu sagmariorum, etc. The Church (he means the Roman, and see
the Members thereof how observe it) is a great fold or stable of Beasts or
Asses; of which some are Pack-Asses, some are Dosse-Asses, and others Burden
Asses, Then relating cuiusmodi Auni sunt nos Catholici? (what sort of Asses we
the Roman Catholics are) We (writes he) must be beasts which have
understanding and reason to obey the Bishops with all humility and patience;
for they are the men, they the Muleters and Asse-drivers, Nota.
they must yoke, bridle and saddle us, put halters about our necks, load and
drive us. For others, they are like to beasts, but tame and moderate beasts,
such as must do what they are commanded, for a good understanding Ass is he,
that honors and follows the direction and command of the Mulettier. He
adds, Reges Catholici sunt Asini cum tintinnabulis; Catholic Kings are Asses
with Bells about their necks, as being the Fore Asses, leading the way to other
inferior Asses. Then much commending Charles the Great, he writes, That Charles
was a far greater and wiser Ass, then those Kings that cast off the Popes
yoke; for Charles being tantus Asinus, so great an Ass, cried (or rather
brayed) out with a loud voice, Vniversae Asinorum mandrae, to the whole fold of
Asses; that is, to the whole Church in this manner, For the memory of St. Peter
let us honor the Roman Church; and though the yoke which the Pope imposes be
such as we can hardly bear, yet let us fall down under the same. Ex quibus
verbis verum Issachar agnoscas, de quo Genesis chapter 49. Issachar Asinus fortis.
From which words of Charles, thou may know he was a very Issachar, of whom it
is said Genesis 49. Issachar is a strong Ass. Thus Schioppius. Is not this fine
Catholic Divinity, enough to enamour all Christian Kings, Princes with the
Church of Rome? which is now become a fold of Asses, instead of a flock of
Sheep, and their Popes, Bishops, Muleters, and Asse-drivers, instead of
Shepherds?

I shall not waste Ink and Paper to answer the other pretended Commissions
given by Christ to St. Peter, on which Popes and their Parasites likewise
ground their universal Supremacy, as See Marsilius Patavinus, Defens. pacis, p.

descanted on it, then in seriousness. Yet Waldensis gravely infers thence.

enthusiastical arguments and aerie conceits, to evidence the Popes Supremacy
from such impertinent texts, or rather Inter seculares, nugae nugae sunt, in
ore sacerdotis blasphemiae. Bern: de Consid. l. 2.
blasphemies, is a sufficient refutation of them.

6ly. When all these Commissions to the Apostles, Peter, and forecited Texts,
will not prop up the Popes tottering Universal Supremacy, they then fly to his
Sword, as to their Triarii, and last refuge, yet with very ill success, if the
Texts and inferences from them be well examined. Our Savior being near his
Passion used these words to his Disciples, Luke 22. 34. to 39. When I sent you
without purse, or scrip, or shoes, (or Mat. 10. 9, 10.
staves) lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. Then sain he unto them;
But now, he that has a purse let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he
that has no Sword, let him sell his garment and buy him one. And they said,
Behold here are two Swords; And he said unto them, It is enough conjoined with
Matthew. 26. 51, 52. John 18. 10, 11. Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it,
and smote the high Priests servant, and cut off his right ear. Then said Jesus
unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath, or into his place; for all they
that take the sword, shall perish with the sword: the cup which my Father has
given me, shall I not drink? From which Texts, Popes and their Bernard. de

Vspergensis p. 343. Here, p. 36. Johannis Par^siensis de Potestate Regali and
Papali.
Paralites, have drawn these strange Conclusions, universally embraced by most
as infallible Oracles.

1. That these two Swords here mentioned, were the Supreme Ecclesiastical and
Temporal Swords of Authority and Jurisdiction, here instituted and
distinguished by Christ himself. 2ly. That those two Swords are distinct in
their own Natures: the one originally put into the hand of St. Peter and his
Successors of Rome alone, and derivatively by and through him into the hands of
the other Apostles, Bishops, Priests, incommunicable unto any Temporal Kings or
Princes. The other put into the actual possession of Emprors or Kings, by St.
Peter and his Successors, to be drawn forth at their command for their and the
Churches defense, as well as for the Government of their kingdoms. 3ly. That
both these Swords are originally given to, and visited in St. Peter and through
him in the Pope, who may dispose of, give, recall and command them at his
pleasure. Strange dotages and delusions drawn by head and shoulders from these
Texts.

To clear which Texts from these false Glosses for the future, I shall desire
the Readers to observe: 1. That the Sword which Christ commanded every of his
Apostles to sell his garment (for want of money) to buy; was not a
Metaphorical, Civil, or Ecclesiastical Sword of Authority or Jurisdiction,
(which had been flat Simonie to buy) but a plain, material, iron sword, which
ordinary soldiers, or servants then wore, (as since they have done, and yet do)
to guard their Kings, Generals, Captains, Masters against violence: For 1. It
was a sword to be bought at the Cutlers, and that for the present defense of
their Master Christ. 2ly. They thereupon all answered (not Peter for them) They
had then two swords, with one whereof Peter cut off Malchus his ear; therefore
both only material iron swords. 3ly. St. Peter's sword was drawn out of his
sheath, when used, and commanded by Christ to be put again into its scabbard or
place; therefore a real iron sword. 4ly. Christ gives this reason for its
putting up, For all they that take the sword, shall perish by it: Therefore
both the swords he commanded them to buy, the two swords they then had, when
Christ said, It is enough; and the sword to be put up were only ordinary swords
of common soldiers, or servants, not of Temporal Magistrates or Prelates. 5ly.
Christ directed his speech not to Peter by name, but to all his other Apostles
in general; He that has no sword let him sell his garment and buy one; and he
having then a sword of his own, this speech did not concern him, but those only
who wanted swords; whence not Peter, but the other Apostles said jointly (as
they replied to Christ's first question, that they wanted nothing;) Behold here
are two swords: which implied a tacit demand, whether they needed to buy any
more? Whereupon Christ said, It is enough, there needed no more. Peter therefore
not being their mouth, in this case, for ought appears; how can these two
swords belong to him alone, upon the other Apostles answers? 6ly. It is most
clear, that one of these two swords was Peter's, is evident by Christ's words to
him; Put up thy Sword: Yet it was only the sword of a common soldier, or
servant; not of a Civil or Ecclesiastical Magistrate; (he being then neither)
and that Apostle whose the other sword was, yea every common soldier that has
or wears a sword, may claim as absolute a Sovereign Ecclesiastical and Temporal
Jurisdiction, as the Pope can do from this sword of Peter. 7ly. Peter then had,
used but one sword alone, not two. How comes the Pope, his pretended Successor,
to challenge two swords, and that of a far different nature from his, and not
to be content with a common Servitors or soldiers sword, as he was? 8ly. Christ
himself severely checked Mat. 26. 50, 51. John. 21. 10 11.
Peter for drawing, smiting with this sword, and cutting off Malchus his ear;
1. Because he did it without his command, who was his Lord and Master. 2ly.
Because he did it before the band, Captain, Officers laid hold on Christ to
apprehend him, so that he began the quarrel. 3ly. Because he smote Malchus that
was next him, and cut off his ear, without any just provocation from him. 4ly.
Because he did it with an ill intent, to Mat. 26. 51, 52, 53. John 28. 11.
prevent, hinder Christ's crucifixion, the fulfilling of the Scriptures, and
redemption of mankind by his passion: from which he dissuading him only a
little before, Christ had thereupon reprehended him, with a double Mat. 16. 23.
Mar. 8. 33.
Get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offense unto me, for thou savourest not
the things of God, but those that be of men. 5ly. Because he drew it out of
incredulity and presumption; as if Christ could not be otherwise rescued from
his apprehenders, but by his rash valor, when Mat: 26. 53, 54.
as his Father would have given and sent him Legions of Angels to rescue him,
and prevent his crucifixion, had he desired it, or had it stood with the
Scriptures, or Gods eternal purpose, and his own good pleasure; wherefore
Peter's drawing and smiting with his sword, being sinful, unlawful in all
these respects, cannot possibly be a just legal foundation for his or the Popes
Temporal or Spiritual Supremacy. 6ly. Christ commands Mat. 26. 52, 53.
Peter to put up his sword into his sheath, and never to draw or use it more;
because all that take the sword (without lawful commission from God) shall
perish with the sword. How then Popes, St. Peter's pretended Successors, can
both challenge, draw, smite with this sword of Peter, not only to cut off
Malchus his ear, but the Crowns, Heads of Christian Emperors, Kings, Lords,
Parliaments, and engage Christian Kings, kingdoms to draw their Military swords
of War against each other, yea their Subjects to draw their swords against
their lawful Emperors, Kings, as against Turks, Infidels, when excommunicated
or deprived by them, and to murder one another by thousands in the field,
against this express prohibition of Christ, and his reason thereto annexed;
let Popes and their flatterers resolve their own and other rational men's
consciences, when they are able. 8ly. Neither Peter nor any other Apostle was
then a King, or Supreme Civil Magistrate, nor personated any such officer, when
Christ used these words of two swords, that they were enough; and gave this
command to Peter, Put up thy sword into his place. How then could either of
these two swords possibly signify or represent the Kings or Magistrates
Supreme Civil Sword of Justice? 9ly. Neither was Peter nor any other of the
Apostles at this time invested with the sole Supreme Ecclesiastical Power or
Jurisdiction, which then wholly resided in Christ himself; How therefore can
Peter's material sword, transferr to the Pope or his successors, the supreme
Spiritual Sword of Jurisdiction over the whole Catholic Church and its
members? 10ly. Those two swords, which Christ said were enough, were both of
one kind; material, not metaphorical; of iron, steel; not of the Spirit; and
but one of them used, or rather abused by Peter: How then can they typifie Two
distinct Jurisdictions vested by Divine institution in two distinct ranks and
Professions of Men, Kings and Priests, Secular Princes and Spiritual Priests?
So that one of them may not usurp the sword of the other two. 11ly. If these
swords, as See Gratian Distinct. 10.
Canonists define; be so different, distinct, and put into those several hands
by Christ's institution, Ephesians. 6. 17.
how came the Pope in Peter's pretended Right to claim, monopolize both; Hebr.
4. 12. Rev. 1. 16. c. 2. 12. c. 19, 14, 15.
when Peter had but one sword, and that of a far different nature from those
Popes now pretend to? 12ly. The Scripture never distinguishes between the
Temporal and Ecclesiastical sword in the Popes and Prelates sense: Indeed it
styles the word of God, Romans 13. 4.
the sword of the spirit, and a (i) two edged sword; and the Vindictive power
of the Civil Magistrate to punish evil doers, (i) a sword; but the pretended
Popes Ecclesiastical censures, whether of Interdicts, Excommunications, 1 Cor:
5. 5. 15. John 9. 22. 34, 35. Mat 18 17.
Anathemaes, or delivering men to Satan, putting them out of the Synagogue, or
being reputed heathens or publicans, are never once styled nor intimated in
Scripture to be a Sword, or to proceed from St. Peter's sword, but Keys alone;
yea Popes, Prelates, Priests, themselves resolve, that all their Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction, Censures are founded on the Power of Peter's Keys, not Sword; and
derive them only from the Keys which Christ committed to him and the other
Apostles, not that sword which Christ commanded him to put up into the sheath,
and use no more. How then came the Keys, and these two swords (so different in
their names, forms, nature, uses, the one to open, shut, bind or loose; the
other to defend penitent, and smite, slay, or punish impenitent sinners) to be
both one, and to give Popes one and the self-same Supreme Temporal and
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction? Either then they must disclaim St. Peter's Keys,
or his two Swords as inconsistent; or if they will distribute the use of one of
his swords to Kings and Civil Magistrates, they must by the self-same reason
allow them one of his keys too: And then Kings, Emperors shall both enjoy,
exercise Supreme Ecclesiastical and Temporal Jurisdiction over the Churches,
and Clergy within their Dominions, by divine Right, as well as the Pope. 12ly.
1 Timothy 3. 3. Tit. 1.
Paul himself makes this a special qualification of a Bishop, that he must be
no striker; whence Bishops and Priests claim an exemption from bearing arms, or
going to war; Therefore they can neither claim nor exercise either of these two
swords. 13ly. This crotchet of two swords, had its principal rise from De
Consideratione ad Eugenium, l. 4.
St. Bernards passage to Pope Eugenius the 3d. about the year of Christ, 1146.

to both swords for this purpose; 1. To prove that the temporal sword belongs
not to the Pope, but only to Christian Emperors, Kings, nor is it put into his
hands. 2ly. That it is to be unsheathed for the Churches defense, when there is
need, not at the Popes or Priests mere pleasure or mandate, but at the Emperors
and Kings special commands. 3ly. That the spiritual Sword of Priests, to be
exercised by the Church, Popes, Prelates, is here expressly defined to be only
the Word of God; the preaching of the Gospel with instance in season, out of
season: the lifting up of Priests voices without ceasing; crying aloud to them
and sparing not, showing the people their sins, and the house of Israel their
transgressions; especially when they prove Dragons, Scorpions, obstinate,
impenitent, hardening their faces, and hearts against all admonitions and
reproofs; In which cases, Popes, Prelates, Priests, must ingeminate, and more
boldly, earnestly, incessantly inculcate their reprehensions and exhortations,
yea harden their faces against them, as they harden theirs: as the Prophets did
in the old Testament; and if they continued incorrigible after all this: Go
forth of Ur, leave them, resort and preach the Gospel to other Cities, as
Christ himself did. This is the only Spiritual sword, and the sole drawing and
smiting with it, belonging to the Church, Priests, Popes; not Suspensions,
Excommunications, Interdicts, Curses with Bell, Book, Candle, not only of
Private persons, but whole Churches, Kingdoms, Cities, Emperors and Kings
themselves; prostrations at their Papal feet, depositions from their Crowns,
loss of their Realms, absolving all Subjects from their allegiance, against
former Oaths, to arm them against their lawful Sovereigns; of which St.
Bernard has not one syllable. Therefore no appurtenances to the Spiritual
sword of Popes or Priests, but mere Antichristian Usurpations, abuses, of this
pretended sword, which wounds many not to their salvation, but destruction.
Finally St. Bernard presses the Pope to use this Spiritual sword not in
England, France, Germany, or other Kings Dominions; but in Rome it self, and
his own Palace, Court alone; where the people, Officers of all sorts, were
generally Dragons, Scorpions, the most impudent, impenitent, brazen-faced,
hard-hearted, desperate sinners of all others, of whose reformation Pope
Eugenius and himself did almost despair. And then induced him to use his utmost
endeavors to reform them, by the forecited smitings of them with the sword of
the Spirit. And in case of their final incorrigibility; not to excommunicate,
interdict, or anathematise them, but desert them totally, and by a voluntary
exile to remove to some other City; to exchange Rome for the World, or any
other part thereof, which was far better then it; there to preach the Gospel,
and discharge his Pastoral office, committed by Christ to Peter, and through
him to himself; by seeding his sheep, which he defines only to be the preaching
of the Gospel to them; concluding in these words, Evangelizare pascere est; fac
opus Evangelistae, et Pastoris opus implesti; Upon all which considerations, I
hope the most zealous Pontificians will henceforth be satisfied; That the Civil
and Spiritual swords have not their distinction, distribution, nor any
foundation at all on Peter's single sword, or the other Apostles two material
swords; and that the only spiritual sword belonging to Popes and the Church, is
not their usual Ecclesiastical Censures, thunderbolts, but the mere word of God
incessantly preached, applied in season and out of season to all sorts of
sinners, especially the most obdurate; wherewith the City and Court of Rome are
so stuffed, that Popes have most reason to brandish this sword, and all other
swords or keys they claim from St. Peter, only there, not in other Princes,
Bishops Diocesses and Dominions, much less against Emperors and Kings
themselves.

2ly. If St. Peter's, the Apostles, Priests and Ministers commissions forecited
will neither warrant, support their Supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction
challenged, pretended to, much less will their several Titles do it. Before I
enter upon the Positive Titles given to them in Scripture, I shall desire you
to take notice, 1. That neither St. Peter, nor any other Apostle, Minister, or
Presbyter, is ever once styled by Christ or any Apostle in relation to his
office; either a King, Prince, Caesar, Lord, or the higher Powers; but only
earthly Kings and temporal Magistrates. De Planctu Eccles. l 1. Artic. 52.
Alvarus Pelagius, the Popes Grand Advocate, does not only ingenuously
acknowledge, but renders these folid reasons for it: First, because Kings and
Lords do frequently abuse their Regal and Lordly power to tyranny and great
oppression of their Subjects; which Popes and Clergymen would be likewise apt
to do, if dignified with these Titles. 2ly. Because the name of a King
aliquando superbum sonat, and is apt to puff men up with pride and arrogance;
therefore inconsistent with the humility and meekness of Christ's Disciples,
Ministers. 3ly. To put a distinction between Civil and Ecclesiastical
Governors. Inter spirituales and temporales Reges sicut est discretio in
potestatibus, sic debet esse in nominibus. Principes itaque seculares nomen
Regis quod commune est, sibi a proprietate retinent, praesertim quia ante
constitutionem spititualium Regum, officium Regis and nomen plures habuisse
leguntur. Principes autem spirituales aliis nominibus nuncupantur, quae non
fastum, sed actum and pietatem insinuant. Et propter hoc ait Petrus, Pastoribus
Ecclesiae, 1 Pet. 5. 2. 3. and 95 Distinct. Esto. Neque ut Dominautes in Clero:
and Christus dixit Discipulis Lu. 22. Reges Gentium dominatur eorum, vos autem
non sic. and Mat. 20 Yea he draws this memorable inference from hence. Et
secundum hoc videretur dicendum, quod licet Christus sit Rex and Sacerdos,
tamen ejus Vicarii scilicet Apostoli and eorum successors, non sunt Sacerdotes
et Reges, imo solum convenit eis potestas Sacerdotalis vel Pontificalis ex,
concessione Christi. Si autem aliquibus eorum convent potestas Regia, hoc est
ex concessione Principum terrenorum; sicut ex concessione Constatini habet
Romanus Prontifex Imperialem potestatem, Distinct. 96. Constituimus. Which
though Alvarus prima facie, grants to be rationabiliter dictum for others; yet
he spends several Ibid. Ar^i^. 51, 52, 53, 56, 57.
Articles to assert, That the Pope is not only a spiritual, but temporal King
and Lord, yea King of Kings and Lord of Lords; and that not only Popes, but
even Bishops and Priests too have a power and jurisdiction above all Kings;
Emperors, Princes in the world, even to excommunicate, depose, and put them
from their Thrones, Kingdoms, Empires, as you heard Here p. 37, 38, 39.
before at large.

2ly. Neither Christ, nor his Apostles after his Ascension in any of their
Epistles or Gospels, ever gave St. Peter or the Pope any of these swelling
Titles now claimed, or Attributed to them by their flatterers; as See here, p.
30 37. 38. 39. Bishop Jewels Defense of the Apology, p. 59, 121, 125, 449 552,
582, 584.
Christ's sole Viceroy, his sole Vicar General on Earth, sole head of the whole
Catholic Church, God, Vice-God, Christ, Christ's Omnipotentiary, or
Plenipotentiary, endued with a plenituds of all power both in heaven and earth,
the life of the world; or any of those Titles which De Consideratione, lib. ^
St. Bernard (by way of irony, censure only) gives to Pope Eugenius, as others
did in good earnest; Age indagemus adhuc diligentius quis sis? quam geras,
videlicet, pro tempore, personum in Ecclesia Dei: Quis es? Sacerdos magnus,
Summus Pontifex. Tu Princeps Apostolorum; tu Primatu Abel; Gubernatu Noe;
Patriarchatu Abraham; Or ^ine Melchisedech, dignitate Aaron, auctoritate
Moses, indicatu Samuel, potestate Petrus, unctione Christus. Tu es cui claves
traditae, cui over creditae sunt. Sunt quidem and alii coeli janitores, and
gregum pastores: Sed tu tanto gloriosius, quanto and differentius utrumque prae
caeteris nomen haereditasti, etc. If none of these ambitious Titles were ever
given by Christ or other Apostles to Peter himself in this magnificent manner^
or to any other Apostle; How comes the Pope now to appropriate them to himself
in Peter's right, who does not own but quite disclaim them? 1 Pet. 1. 1. c. 5.
1, 2, 3.

Wherefore pretermitting them as late Papal fancies, invented by Popes and
their Parasites, I shall proceed to St. Peter's particular Scripture Titles,
peculiar to himself: whereon Popes and their flatterers bottom his and their
own pretended transcendent Supremacy.

The 1. is his very Surname, Peter, Mat. 16. 18. I say unto thee, thou art
Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church. Whence they infer, Innocentii

That Peter is not only supreme head of Christ's Church, but the very stock and
foundation on which it is built.

I answer, 1. That he had this very name Peter given him either before he was
called by Christ to be an Apostle, or at leastwise he was named Peter by Christ
upon his very first calling to be his Disciple, Mat. 4 18. c. 8. 14, 15. Mar.

then the supreme head thereof on earth, for some years after. This repetition,
or confirmation of this his former Title, could give him no such new headship
or supremacy. 2ly. Neither Christ nor any of his Apostles, or Evangelists,
before or after Christ's resurrection, who often style him by the name of Mat. 16.
1^. John 21. 15, 16, 17. Mat. 17 25. Mar. 1. 30, 36. c. 14. 37. Luke 3. 4, 5.

Simon Peter, jointly, or Peter singly; Nor yet Peter himself, (who styles
himself in his General Epistle, 1 Pet. 1. 1. 2 Pet 1. 1. Peter, and Simon Peter
A SERVANT and an Apostle of Jesus Christ; and 1 Pet. 5. 1. a Fellow-Elder:)
ever dreamed of such a supremacy or headship, as this, or of the least Dominion
or Jurisdiction over the rest of the Apostles, or Elders of the Church, much
less over the whole Church of God, and Emperors, Kings themselves, as Popes
now claim. 3ly. This name Peter, as I say unto the thou art Peter, attest, was
only personal, individual, affixed to his own person alone, not transmitted to
his pretended successors of Rome, who Platina, Onuphrius, Baronius, Dr. Barns,
Lydius, Opmerus, Laertius Cherubinus, and others who wrote the Popes Lives, and
Pontificale Romanum.
though they usually change their former Names, when elected and crowned Popes;
yet not one of them ever yet styled himself Peter, but many of them Paul; and
more of them John: Therefore not one of them assuming this name Peter, and
neither Christ himself, nor Peter transmitting his surname Peter to them, they
can derive no Supremacy from it to themselves. 4ly. Yet all later Popes aver
themselves to be Hardings Confutation f. 210. Bp. Jewels Defense p. 125. 127.

not only Christ, but Peter himself; and what ever is given, offered to, or
acted by them; to be given to, done, acted by St. Peter himself: and all things
acted against their Antichristian Usurpations, to be acted against St. Peter;
as their Epistles, Bulls, Canons, Formularies, Interdicts, Excommunications,
and Charters of pretended or real Donations to them by Constantine, Charles the
Great, King John and others evidence: When as the Pope in reality and Name, is
no more St. Peter himself, then he is Judas, the son of perdition, S. James; or
Peter Lombard, Peter, the Hermit, Peter Martyr, or any other bearing that name;
nor so much Peter, as Peter's statue, or picture representing his pourtaicture;
which may as justly claim the Authority, and more rightly the name of Peter,
(which they all give it) then any Pope 5ly. If this very name Peter, has the
headship, or supremacy of the Church affixed to it, then every person styled
Peter (especially if a King and Sovereign Prince) may as justly challenge the
supremacy and headship of the Church, as any Pope, especially when styled
Innocent, Boniface, Gregory, Clement, or any other such name, not Peter. 6ly.
St. Peter resolves, 1 Pet. 2. 3. to 10.
that the Lord Jesus Christ (not he) is the precious Headstone, which God has
laid in Zion, prophesied of by Isaiah c. 28. 16. and Ps. 118. 20. to whom
coming as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but approved of God,
ye also as living stones are built up a spiritual house (or Church) an holy
Priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable unto God through him;
that he is made the head of the corner, and he that believes on him shall not
be confounded: Yea himself repeated it again Acts 4. 8. to 12. Then Peter
filled with the holy Ghost, said, Ye Rulers of the people and Elders of Israel,
be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God has raised from the
dead, even by him does this man stand here before you whole. This (not I) is
the Stone which is become the head of the corner: Here St. Peter himself twice
precisely refutes the blasphemous Glosses, Inferences of his Successors to Rob
Christ of his Headship, stoneship, and translate it to the Pope, through St.
Peter's conduct-pipe. 7ly. St. Paul who is joined hand in hand with Peter in
Popes seals, Crosiers, Bulls, Charters, yea joint Bishop of Rome (as well as
joint Martyr with him, if he were ever Bishop there) resolves with Peter, That
other foundation (of the Church and Christian faith) can no man lay, but that
which is already laid, which is Jesus Christ, (not Peter) 1 Cor. 3. 10, 11, 12.
And we are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets (in general,
not in Peter) Jesus Christ himself being the chief Ephesians. 2. 21, 23.
cornerstone, in whom, (not in Peter) all the building fitly framed together
grows unto an holy temple in the Lord, in whom ye also are builded together
for an habitation of God through the Spirit. 8ly. Tract. 1. in Mat.
Origin long sincere solved; Petra est quisquis est Discipulus Christ, and that
these words spoken to Peter, were common to all: St. Adversus Januarium l. 1.
Hierom seconds him, Ecclesia fundatur super omnes Apostolas: ex aequo super
eos Ecclesiae fortitudo solidatur, in and by Christ the chief cornerstone, on
whom they are all built: Wherewith our learned Defense of the Apol. p. 125

Alvarus Pelagius too, (though grand sticklers for the Popes Supremacy:) quote
this passage of Origin Hom. xii. in Hieremiam, thus resolving; Quae est igitur
Petra? 1 Cor. 10. 4.
Dominus Jesus Christus; bibebant enim de spirituali consequente Petra, and
super Petram statuit pedes meos. Quaeris alias Petras, and alias Cavernas?

Christi Petra sunt, ut Petra est ille qui docuit. With St. Hierom Com: in

faith which Peter confessed of him (not Peter himself, Psalm. 40. 2.
but secundum Metaphoram, as put for his faith confessed) to be the Rock on
which the Church is built; that Non a Petro Petra, sed Petrus a Petra, sicut
Christus non a Christiano, 1 Cor. 10. 4.
sed Christianus a Christo. Non dictum est illi, Tu es Petra, sed Tu es Petrus.
Ideo quippe ait Dominus; Super hanc Petram aedificabo Ecclesiam meam: quia
dixerat Petrus, Tu es filius Dei vivi: super hanc Petram quam confessus es
aedificabo Ecclesiam meam, Petra enim erat Christus: super hanc Petram quam
cognovisti aedificabo Ecclesiam meam: Super me aedificabo te, non me super te.
To which Authorities, and Apoc. 2: 17. (objected against the Popes Supremacy by
Wickliff, his Master Gulielmus, and others) they give this pitiful Answer,
Super Christum Petram primo and principaliter aedificatur Ecclesia: secundum
vero formam Vicariam super Petrum Petram. Omnes Apostoli Petrae sunt, praecipue
tamen Petrus, in quo omnes Petrae primo nomen sumpserunt; When as * Origin
(from whom they draw this inference) resolves, That all the Petty Rocks of
Apostles and Prophets derived their names only from Christ the Rock, not from
Peter: Which rotally subverts his headship and supremacy from this Text, and
Title of Peter.

other his Champions, have found out an unanswerable Text, to prove his
Headship over the Universal Church: to wit, Christ tells Peter, he should be
called Cephas, which signifyes a Head: Petrus secutus est Christum, non solum
in genere Martyrii, sed and in ordine Magisterii, quod Christus ostendit, cum
ait, Tu vocaberis Cephas. Licet enim Cephas secundum unam linguam;
interpretatur, Petrus, secundum alteram tamen exponitur Caput, Nam sicut caput
habet plenitudnem sensuum, caetera vero membra partem recipient plenitudinis,
ita caeteri Sacerdotes vocati sunt in partem sollicitudinis, sed Summus
Pontifex (he should have said Petrus rather) assumptus est in plenitudinem
potestatis: Pope Epist. 89. See Bp. Jewel His Def. of the Apology, p. 2. p. 125.
Leo the 1. thus blasphemously writes of Peter, (intending the Pope and himself
thereby) Christus Petrum in consortium individuae Trinitatis assumpsit: And
thence inferres, Deus a Petro velut a quodam Capite dona sua velut in corpus
omne diffudit.

To all which I answer, 1. That Cephas, signifies not a Head in any Language
(as these wilfully mistake) but only a Stone, or Peter; witness John 1. 42.
(the text whereon they rely) When Jesus beheld Simon, he said, thou art Simon
the son of Jonah, thou shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation,
Lapis, so some; or Petrus, so others render it; and our English Translations, a
Stone, or Peter, not an head. Yea the Holy Ghost himself, by St. Paul's sacred
pen, gives him this Title of Cephas, (as the very same with Peter) no less
then 5 several times in his Epistles, 1 Cor 1. 12. Every one of them says, I
am of Paul, and I of Apollo, and I of Cephas: where Paul and Apollo are put
before Cephas, as they are also 1 Cor. 3. 22. 25. Whether Paul or Apollo, or
Cephas, etc. all are yours. and 1 Cor. 9. 5. Have not we power to lead about a
sister, or wife, as well as other Apostles, as the brethren of the Lord, and
Cephas; where all the other Apostles, James and John are marshalled before
Cephas. Gal. 2. 5. And when James, Cephas and John, which seemed to be pillars,
perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the
right hand of fellowship, that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the
circumcision: Here Cephas is recited after James; and both James, Cephas and
John, (the grand pillars of the Church) gave both to Paul and Barnabas, the
right hand of fellowship, as their equals, neither claiming an absolute
headship over them or the Church, as Popes do now from this Title Cephas, 1
Cor. 15. 5. That he was seen of Cephas (after his resurrection) then of the
twelve; here only Cephas is placed before the 12. not in point of priority of
order or dignity, but because he Christus cum resurrexit a mortuis prius se
Petro, quam caeteris ostendit Apostolis, quia secundum Apostolum visus est
Cepha, post hoc undecim. Innocentius l. 3. Mysterium Missae pars 1. n. 8. Tom.
1. p. 321.
first saw Christ at his appearance after his resurrection, before any of the
other Apostles, to comfort and strengthen his soul after his treble detestable
denying of Christ: Wherefore this surname Cephas then given to Simon being one
and the same with Peter, and signifying not an head, rock, nor chief
head-stone, or Topstone, a Title peculiar to Jesus Christ alone: and Simon
Peter by this very name Cephas, being in four several Texts ranked after Paul,
Apollos, James, John, and all the Apostles, it cannot prove St: Peter's or the
Popes headship over the Church. 2ly. Admit Cephas signified a head; yet it does
not signify the head of the Universal Church, the head of the World, the head
of Bishops, principalities, powers; which Popes must prove before they pretend
thereto. For 1. It is used in Scripture for the head of the natural body in a
proper sense, Psalm. 23. 5. 2 Kings 10. 6, 7, 8, etc. 2ly. Metaphorically; as 1.

Spiritual supreme head; so Christ is styled the head of the Church, the head of

and God the head of Christ, and head over all, 1 Chronicles: 29. 11. Psalm: 18. 43. 1

Gods, and Vice-gods, as well as Heads.

3ly. I proceed to those respective Titles, Names given to all Apostles,
Ministers of the Gospel, and their Church-offices in the New Testament, neither
of which imports or transferrs to them any Supreme Ecclesiastical or Temporal
Jurisdiction, at least not such as Popes, Popish Prelates, Priests now claim
and exercise.

1. The chief and first of all those Titles both for dignity and authority, is
an Apostle: St. Paul resolving, that God has set in his Church; 1 Cor. 12. 28.
First Apostles: and that Ephesians. 4. 11.
when Christ ascended far above all heavens, he gave some (to be) Apostles,
etc. the first and chiefest in order; as all In their Commentaries on the Acts,
and Paul's and Peter's Epistles.
Divines, and Popes themselves acknowledge. Now what does this prime title
signify or import? No jurisdiction at all, but only a messenger sent by Jesus
Christ into all the world to preach the Gospel to all Nations according to his
mission and commission, Mat. 28. 19, 20. Mar. 16. 15. 16. John 20. 21. Acts 26
17, 18. Romans 1. 5. (...) as all Divines and See Scapula his Lexicon, Calepine,
Holioke, Calvin, and Riders Dictiories.
Dictionaries accord, is derived from the Greek word (...), which signifies to
send in a message; Hence Mat. 11. 10. Luc. 7 27. Christ says of John Baptist,
This is he of whom it is written, Mal. 3. 1. c. 2. 7
Behold I send my Messenger before thy face. Thus Phil. 2. 25. Epaphroditus is
styled Paul's Brother and companion in labor, and fellow-souldier, but your
messenger; and 2 Cor: 6. 23. Titus (whom the Pope and Bishops assert to be
Archbishop of Crete) and the brethren with him, are styled Paul's
fellow-helpers; laborers, and Apostles, which our best Translation renders the
Messengers of the Churches, and the glory of Christ: 2ly. This Title of Apostle
was not peculiar to St. Peter, but common to all the 12. at first, Mat. 10. 2.
Lu. 6, 13. 3ly. After Christ's ascension the Title of an Apostle was given to
Matthias, Paul, Titus, and some others, Acts 1. 26. Romans 1. 1. 1 Cor. 9. 1, 2.
Ephesians. 4. 11. 1 Timothy 2. 7. 2 Cor. 6. 23. Gal. 2: 1. 17. 19. who were equal
with, not inferior to the other Apostles. This is the highest Title given to
them through all the Evangelists, Acts, Epistles, and Apocalips: The first they

Pet. 1. 1, 2 Pet. 1. 1. Paul called to be an Apostle, Paul an Apostle by the
will of God, etc. Rom: 1. 1, 2 Cor. 1. 1. Ephesians: 1. 1. Col. 1. 1. 1 Timothy 1. 1. 2 Timothy 1. 1. 1 Tit. 1. 1. And their very Office in relation to this style, is
termed an Apostleship, Mission, Ministry, Acts 1. 25. Romans 1. 5. 1 Cor. 3. 2.
Gal. 2. 8. Therefore no title, office of Jurisdiction. 4. In this Apostleship
of St. Peter, there are these memorable circumstances subverting his pretended
supremacy over the rest, and whole Catholic Church. 1. That Peter was not the
first Apostle by vocation, or age; for John 1. 37, to 40.
Andrew, and another Disciple were called, and followed Christ as his Apostles
before Peter; Whence Doctrinale Fidei, Tom. 1. l. 2. cap. 1. p. 138. 139.
Thomas Waldensis (a great asserter of his supremacy) confesses, Petrus non
dicitur Apostolorum primus, primitate vocationis, sed auctoritate praelationis:
Petrus non est Apostolorum Princeps, senectute, sed potestate. 2ly. He is not
always first named, but Mat. 16. 21, 22 23. Mar. 8. 31. 32, 33. Lu. 4. 7. 8.

Paul, Barnabas, (as Mar. 16. 17. 1 Cor. 1. 12. c. 3. 22. c. 9. 5. Gal. 2. 9.)
3ly. That he was Mat. 26. 31, 32, 33, 75. Mar. 14. 29, 30, 31. Lu. 22. 33, 34.
more sharply, frequently reprehended by Christ then all the other Apostles,
yea styled Satan; and one that savoured not the things of God but men; 1. for
dissuading him from his passion. 2ly. For Mat. 26. 51. to 55. John 18. 10, 11.
his arrogance, and self-confidence, That though all others should deny Christ,
yet he would not. 3ly. For Mat. 14. 38. to 22.
drawing his sword and cutting off Malchus his ear without command, to prevent
his passion; and doubting of Christ's power. 4ly. For his peremptory refusal at
first to let Christ wash his feet. 5ly. For Acts 10. 13, 14, 15.
his want of faith when he be began to sink, in presuming to walk to Christ
upon the sea. 6ly. For Mat. 26. 60. to the end Mar. 14. 66. to the end, Lu. 22.
(...) to 63. John 28, 25, 26, 27.
reputing the creatures whom God had sanctified and commanded him to eat (and
the Gentiles whom they typified) unclean, refusing to eat of them when God
enjoined him. 7ly. He more shamefully denied his Master Jesus Christ, and that
with Oaths and execrations, then all the rest of the Apostles, and that thrice
one after another, notwithstanding Christ's premonition thereof. 8ly. Christ
doubted of the sincerity of his love more then of all the other Apostles, after
his treble denial of him: Whence he thrice put this question to him one after
another, but to none else, John 21. 19, 26, 17. John 23. 6, 7, 8.
Simon, love thou me? 9ly. St. Paul at Antioch withstood and reprehended
Peter openly to his face, because he was to be blamed: First, for his Julaizing
and complying with the Jews: 2ly. For with rawing himself from, and refusing
to ^at with the believing Gentiles, and that out of fear. 3ly. For his
dissimulation, and not walking uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel.
4ly. For compelling the Gentiles, to live as do the Jews. But we never read
that Peter thus reprehended Paul, or any other Apostle, for any crime
whatsoever. 10ly. The Call. 2. 11, to 17.
Apostles that were at Jerusalem when they heard that Samaria had received the
word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John; who went unto them by their
order: Therefore the other Apostles thus sending Peter, were rather Supreme,
then he or John thus sent by them. 11ly. When Acts 8. 14, 15.
Peter returned to Jerusalem after Cornelius his baptism and conversion, he was
there publicly questioned by the Church for his going to, and eating with them
which were not circumcised, and forced to make a large Apology for it, by the
special command of the Spirit, and the miracles wrought among them by him.
Whereupon they were satisfied. If St. Peter had been so supreme as the Pope
would make him, it had been a great presumption in them thus publicly to
question and arraign him for his actions; when as none must now question or
judge the Pope for any Crime or sin how great soever; nor to say to him,
Domine, cur ita fac^s? though he should send millions of souls to hell, and
decree Virtues to be Vices, and Vices virtues; as the Gratian Did. 21. and 40.

Bellarmin himself determine; He being paramount all Judicatories, Tribunals
whatsoever, and General Councils too, as they dog^atize. 12ly. Peter was the
Apostle principally of the Circumcision only, and that not the chief, St. James
residing constantly amongst them, and being Bishop of Jerusalem (as most averr)
not Peter; who though he converted Acts. 10 and 1^ and 8.
Cornelius and his family who were Gentiles, and was sent with John to Samaria,
and cured Aeneas, and raised Tabitha at Lydda and Ioppa; yet we read not, that
he publicly preached at Lydda, Joppa, or planted any one Church among the
Gentiles, whose company he avoided for fear of the Jews. Hence Paul relates
Gal. 2. 7, 8, 9. Now when James, Cephas, and John (who seemed to be pillars)
saw that the Gospel of the uncircumcisim was committed unto me, as the Gospel
of circumcision was unto Peter, for he that wrought effectually in him the
Apostleship of the Circumcision, was mighty in me toward the Gentiles) they
gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go unto
the Heathen, and James, Peter and John to the circumcision. Upon which account
Peter directed his first Epistle only to the scatered Jews. Now the
circumcision and Jews being but a very small number, the least part of the
world, Church, the other Apostles mission being generally to all the world, and
principally to the Gentiles, of whom St. Paul was the prime Apostle, Romans 15.
18, to 26. c. 16. 26. Ephesians. 3. 3, to 12. Col. 1. 8. 27, 28, 29. Romans 10. 18.
who spread the Gospel into most parts of the world, planted many famous
Churches amongst the Gentiles, and in Rome it self, to whom he directed a
several Epistle, but Peter none at all, nor was ever there, for ought appears
by Scripture. How Peter or Popes, can against all these particulars, with any
color of verity or ingenuity assert St. Peter to be paramount all other
Apostles, undoubted head, or sole Vicar General of the whole Catholic Church,
Let all Roman Catholics resolve their consciences, and theirs who on all
these grounds deny it. Yet notwithstanding Alvarus Pelagius de Planctu. Eccles.
l. 1. Artic. 55. f. 38, 39.
Alvarus Pelagius informs us, That the Church is called Apostolical, because
it is founded on the Apostles, especially on St. Peter the chief of the
Apostles; That the Church of Rome is styled, The Church of the Apostles Peter
and Paul; Therefore the Pope is Summus Rector Ecclesiae, dicitur Apostolicus,
yea Apostolus in many of his Bulls, and Canonists Glosses; and Seeds
Apostolica, vocatur seeds Papalis in multis locis (of Gratian, and his Glossers
there cited) Et dignitas Papalis officium Apostolicum appellatur; Et Lex Papae
vel Constitutio, Apostolica instituta vocantur, and quia Petrus and Paulus
princeps Apostolorum Romanam Ecclesiam Christo Domino confirmarunt: Et quia
omnes Apostolos fuerunt fundamentum and origo totius Ecclesia militantis: Et
quia Papa est Vicarius illius magni Apostoli, desuper missi Christi de sinu
Patris, ipse successor Petro, in quo tota Apostolica authoritas secundum
plenitudinem reservatur: Being all built upon the sand, since both the Title,
Office of an Apostle, or Messenger, comprehend no Sovereign Jurisdiction in
them.

The 2d. Title given them in Scripture, even whiles they were Apostles, is
Disciples, and that as well after as before Christ's Resurrection. This Title is
given them more frequently in the Evangelists, and Acts, then that of Apostle,
in many hundred places: and in Mat: 28. 19. Mar: 16. 7. John 20. 18, 19, 20.
25, 26, 30. c. 21. 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 14. Acts 1. 15. c. 9. 1. they are styled
Disciples after Christ's resurrection, and their Mission as Apostles: This title
was likewise common to them all, yea to all Christians and converts to the
faith, though no Apostles, Bishops, nor Ministers of the Gospel, Acts 6. 1, 7.
c. 9. 25, 26, 28. c. 11. 26, 29. c. 14. 20, 22, 28. c. 15. 16. c. 18. 23. 27.
c. 19. 1, 3, 30. c. 20. 7. 30. c. 21. 4. 17. Now this Title of Disciples,
common to Apostles and all Christians, carries not the least color or shadow
of any, much less of supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in it, but rather of
subjection to the doctrine, instruction of others who instructed them.

The 3d. Title, next in dignity to that of Apostles, is Prophets, and their
ministry is usually styled prophesying; Acts 13. 1. c. 15. 42. 1 Cor. 12. 29.
c. 14. 3, 4, 5, 6, 22, 29. c. 11. 5. Ephesians. 4. 11. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 20. That this
Title carries in it any Ecclesiastical or Civil Jurisdiction, especially
Supreme, no mortal can conjecture, nor any now claim, since they disown this
Name.

The 4th Title is an Evangelist, or Preacher of the Gospel, whose office is
styled Preaching, Ephesians. 4. 11. Acts 2. 8. 1 Timothy 4. 1, 2, 5. Rom: 10. 8. 15.
25. 1 Cor: 1. 18. 2 Cor: 10. 14. And in this there is no Jurisdiction at all
couched, much less Supreme.

This Title of Preacher, Alvarus Pelagius de Planctu Eccles. l. 1. Art. 62.
is not peculiar to Apostles, Bishops or Priests by order, but attributed
frequently to King Solomon, Ecclesiastes 1. 1, 2. styled The Preacher; The
words of the Preacher, the Son of David, King of Jerusalem. Vanity of
Vanities, says the Preacher, all is vanity. I the Preacher was King over
Israel in Jerusalem. And c. 7. 27. c. 12. 8, 9, 10. He often styles himself. The
Preacher; adding, Because the Preacher was wise he still taught the people
knowledge; yea he gave good heed and sought out, and set in order many
Proverbs: and the Preacher sought to find out acceptable words: And as King
Solomon, so King David his Father, was a Preacher too; else he would not have
recorded, Psalm: 40. 9, 10. O Lord my God, I have Preached righteousness in the
great congregation, lo I have not refrained my lips, O Lord thou know. I
have not hid thy righteousness within my heart, I have delivered thy
faithfulness and thy salvation, I have not concealed thy loving kindness and
thy truth from the great ^rrgregatio^. Yea other Christian Kings, as Eusebius. de
Vita Constantini.
Constantine, Beda, Mat. Westminster. Holinshed in his Life.
Oswald, have been preachers and expounders of the Scriptures to their people
upon special occasions, in default of able learned Bishops, the Alvarus
Pelagius de Planctn Eccles. l. 1. Art. 62. See here chapter 5.
principal duty of Kings being to endeavor the felicity and salvation of their
peoples souls, as well as bodies or estates. Thus Noah, (though no Priest by
order) is styled, a Preacher of righteousness, 2 Pet. 2. 5. And though the
office of public preaching the Gospel was principally committed to the
Apostles and Ministers of the Gospel; yet it is specially recorded, Acts 8. 1,
2, 3 4, 5. to 26. Zanct. in Act. 8.
That when the Church at Jerusalem were all scattered through Paul's persecution
throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the Apostles; Therefore
they that were scattered abroad, (whom Zanctius the Jesuit, and Baronius too
affirm to be above 15000. who were not certainly all ordain Ministers, but
Laymen) went every where preaching the word, and converting souls in Samaria
and elsewhere; which the Apostles being informed of, sent Peter and James from
Jerusalem to pray with, confirm, and lay hands on those they converted, that
they might receive the holy Ghost, and likewise preach the Gospel in those
parts. Yea Eusebius Ecclesiast. Hist. ^l. 6. c. 20. Nicephorus Calixtus Eccl.

Origin himself about 200. years after Christ, quando Presbyteratus honorem
nondum esset consecutus, whiles he was a Layman, at the earnest request of the
Bishops of Palestine, ut de sacris libris dissereret, et publica eas in
Ecclesia interpretaretur (for defect of able Ministers and Bishops to instruct
them) thereupon publicly preached and expounded the Scriptures in Caesarea.
Upon which Demetrius (a person disaffected to Origin) writing Letters to the
Bishops of Palestine, Nunquam ante auditum, nunquam factum esset, ut
praesentibus Episcopis Laici concionarentur; Thereupon they all, specially
Alexander Bishop of Jerusalem, and Theoctyactus Bishop of Cesarea, in defense
thereof returned him this answer in writing, charging him with untruths, Quod
autem in literus dixeris, Nunquam ante auditum, neque iam usurpatum, ut Laici
praesentibus Episcopis disputarent, Scripturasque erponerent, in eo nobis
(nescio quomodo, videris) perspicue falsa dixisse. Nam ubi idonei et habiles
reperiuntur qui fratribus in verbo Dei adiumento sint, a sanctis Episcopis
rogantur, ut populum in verbo instituant, et per exhortationes ad populum verba

Aedesius and Frumentius, two godly Christian Merchants trading among the
Indians, occasionally preached the Gospel to them, and converting them to the
Christian faith; exhorted them to meet together, and celebrate divine
Mysteries, which they exhibited to them. Upon their return from thence, and
reporting the Indians conversion to the faith by their means, Athanasius
thought sit to give them Orders, make them Bishops, and send them again to the
Indians for their further instruction and conversion, to complete that work
which God had so happily began by them. Neither can Popes nor Popish Prelates

Paul resolution, 1 Cor: 14. 33, 34. 1 Timothy 2. 11, 12, 13. Upon which ground
about the year 1620. there sprang up a new order of Iesuitesses, or
She-Iesuites, in Italy, Germany and other places; who took upon them to preach
publicly and privately to others of their sex, and under pretext of promoting
the salvation of souls, alia opera permulta sexus et ingenii imbecillitati and

The scandal whereof grew so great, that Pope Urban the 8. by his Bull, dated
in January 1630. was enforced utterly to suppress their Congregation, Order,
Houses. Pope (*) Gregory the 13. Anno Domini 1584. by a special Bull granted
this special Privilege to the whole Society of the Jesuits and their
Emissaries; to preach in all places without interruption, though not in Orders.
Explaining and ratifying the Bull of Pope Paul the 8th. which as Gregory's Bull
recites, had granted them this Privilege. Ex illo concessionis hujusmodi

Therefore this Title of an Evangelist or Preacher, can derive no supreme
Jurisdiction, power to the Pope, (who seldom preaches) or any other in and
over the Church of God, since every Jesuit, though not in Orders, may preach.

This Liberty of preaching indulged by this Popes Bull to Lay-Jesuits, in all
places without control, has been one cause of the growth of such Preachers
during our late Confusions, many of these disguised Jesuits having bin
preachers among us; and of the prodigious increase of the Jesuits beyond all
other Orders of the Roman Church, (through the extraordinary favors,
assistances of the Pope, and King of Spain; they being the most active
Instruments to promote the Popes Universal Monarchy over the Church, and
Spaniards Universal Monarchy over the whole world,) worthy our special
Observation. Their Order, Society, by Ignatius Loyola his solicitation (the
Founder thereof) was Hospinian and Ludovicus Lucius Historiae Jesuitica, l. 1.

at first not being above 15. or 16. increasing by Degrees was ordered not to
exceed 60. at most; but 3. years after the Pope left it free to Ignatius and
his successors to admit so many as they pleased into their Society. Whereupon
they increased so exceedingly, that Petrus Rabadeniera Anno 1608. and Aubertus
Myraeus, Anno 1620. published a Catalogue of the Number of their Colleges,
Houses, Cells, in all quarters of the world, and of the fellows of their
Society therein (besides their Novices and Scholars.) Their Domus Professae
then (within the compass of 80. years,) announted to 21. their Colleges to
371. their Domus professae separatae to 43. their Houses and Residentiaries to
103. in all 538. and their Socii, or Patres societatis in them to 13010. The
Numbers of these Locusts being then so augmented, that Claudius Aquaviva their
General boasted, Ludovic: Lucius Hist Jesuitica l. 1. c. 7. p. 156.
That he could raise an Army sooner then any Christian King: and in the time of
the Venetian Interdict, when Pope Paul the 8th. was in some danger, covenanted
to raise him an Army of forty thousand men, upon this condition, that whosoever
was slain in that war, should be reputed a martyr. In the year 1640. (being
their Jubilee, or 100. year from their Societies institution) they published in
print new Tables of their Houses, Colleges, Cells, then printed at Antwerp,
with additions to the former; wherein Ignatius was pourtrayed lying along on

in the unparalled murder, proceedings against our late King Charles of
glorious memory; and had no small influence in the late metamorphosis of our
Hereditary Kingdoms, into the confused Chaos of a new Free Commonwealth;
Having (as the General of the English Jesuits confessed to a Noble English
Lord in their College at Rome) Anno 1653. in England above 1500 of their
Society able to work in several trades, (which the Bu^l of Pope Gregory the
13th. inables them to exercise, as well as to preach without Orders.) They
having a Consistory and Council that ruled all the affairs of the Kings in
England: into which they never came over in those swarms, as they did during
our late confusions; as Cromwell himself relates in his printed Speech, Sept.
4. 1654. p. 16, 17. and being the Heads and Lay-preachers to most of our New
sects, as well as Soldiers in our late Armies, and Garrisons?

Their 5th. Title (whereunto all Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, and that by
divine right is now pretended to be annexed as inseparable, incommunicable to
Kings, Temporal Magistrates, or to ordinary Priests, Presbyters, Ministers) is
that of Bishop, or Overseer, and their office a Bishopric, or good work, Acts
20. 28. Phil: 1. 8. 1 Timothy 3. 1. Tit: 1. 7.

To which I answer first: That if the Supreme Titles, offices of Apostles,
Disciples, Evangelists have no such Jurisdiction included in or conferred by
them, as is pretended, then this of Bishop or Overseer, inferior to them, can
have none, at least none greater or so great as they. 2ly It is only a Title of
Ministry, not of Dignity; of Labor, not Honor; of Operation not Denomination;
of Watching, not Lording or loytering; as Fathers and Councils in all ages have
defined: I shall present you with a short view of their resolves herein, to
abate that Timpany of Ambition, pride, superciliosnesse, luxury, which Popes,
others challenge only from this Title of Bishop. In Mat. Hom. 13. and in Esaiam

existimet homo ut ministros Christi and dispensatores mysteri^ram Dei. Peccat
autem in Deum quicunque Episcopus, qui non quasi conservis servus ministrat,
sed quasi Dominus. Frequenter autem et quasi amarus Dominus dominans per vim:
similis constitutus Egyptiis, qui affligebant vitam filiorum Israel vi, etc.

De Dignitate Sacerdotis, l. 4.
St. Ambrose resolves, Nisi bonum opus amplecturis Episcopus esse non potes; a
Bishopric being not a Dignity or Dominion, but a good work, etc.

St. Chrysostom Hom. 11. in Ephesios, Non dominamur, ait, fidei vestrae, thus
resolves. O D^lecti, nec Domini more haec imperamus. Doctrinae verbi praefecti
sumus, non est nobis mandatus Magistratus, nec data Auctoritas. Consiliariorum
admonentium locum tenemus. Opus Imperfectum in Matthew. Hom. 35. Principes
Gentium dominantur eis, etc. Christus fructum humilitatis terrestris posuit,
primatum caelestem: et primatus terrestris fructum posuit confusionem
caelestem. Quicunque ergo desiderat primatum caelestem, sequatur humilitatem
terrestrem: quicumque autem desiderat Primatum in terra, inveniet confusionem
in coelo: ut jam inter servos Christi non sit de Primatu certamen, nec festinet
unusquisque eorum, quomodo aliis major appareat, sed quomodo omnibus inferior
videatur. Conversatio igitur melior est desideranda, non dignior gradus.
Principes autem Ecclesiae fiunt, ut serviant minoribus suis, et ministrent iis,
quaecunque acceperunt, ut suas utilitates negligant, and illorum procurent: ut
si opus fuerit neque mori recusent pro salute inferiorum suorum, sicut
Apostolus dicit: Ego autem impendar, and superimpendar pro animabus vestris. Si
haec ergo ita se habent, Primatum Ecclesiasticum concupiscere neque ratio est,
neque causa, quia neque justum est, neque utile, as he there proves at large.
Denique ipsi honores in Christo in prima quidem facie videntur honores, revera
autem non sunt honores diveru^, sed diversa ministeria.

St. Augustine determines; Episcopatus nomen est Operis, non Honoris, etc. ut
intelligat se non else Episcopum, qui pra esse dilexerit, non prodesse.
Comment. in Psalm. 126
Quomodo vinitori altior locus factus est, ad custodiendam vineam, sic and
Episcopis altior fit locus, ut ipsi superintendant, and tanquam custodiant
populum. Et de isto loco alto periculosa redditur ratio, nisi eo cord stemus
hic, ut humilitate sub pedibus vestris simus, and pro vobis oremus, ut qui
novit mentes vestras, ipse custodiat. Custodimus enim vos ex officio
dispensationis, sed custodiri volumus vobiscum: tanquam vobis pastores sumus,
sed sub illo Pastore vobiscum oves sumus. Tanquam vobis Doctores ex hoc loco
sumus, sed sub uno illo Magistro in hac Schola vobiscum condiscipuli sumus. Si
volumus custodiri ab illo, qui humiliatus est propter nos, and exaltatus ad
custodiendos nos, Humiles simus, Nemo sibi arroget aliquid.

Consideratione ad Eugenium Papam, lib. 2. with infinite more unanimously
resolved. Episcopatus nomen est Operis, non Honoris; Opus, inquit Apostolus,
non dignitatem, laborem, non delicias and honorem. Opus, pet quod per
humilitatem crescat, non fastidio intumescat. Ne igitur Dominatum et
Auctoritatem solum expetat. Nec desiderare Episcopatum putandus est, qui suum
desiderat iucrum vel honorem, non plebis salutem. Non enim dicitur, qui
Episcopatum desiderat, bonum Gradum desiderat, sed bonum Opus. Ipse ergo sibi
testis est, quia Episcopatum non appetit, qui non boni Operis Ministerium, sed
Honoris gloriam quaerit. See the Vnb^shoping of Timothy and Titus, p 9^, to 100.
Episcopi nomen non Dominium, sed Officium, non Honos, sed Onus. Nec enim
Dignitates sunt Ecclesiastica, sed opus: co quod unumquodque horum pro communi
utilitate est constitutum, sive Episcopatus, sive Diaconia, sive unumiquodque
aliud. Curam potius haereditabis et Operam, quam gloriam et divitias. Non est
Episcopus qui praeesse dilexerit non prodesse: There is therefore nothing in
the Title, or Office of a Bishop, (being only a work) that can give St. Peter,
the Pope, or any other Bishop, Presbyter, Elder or Minister, any Supreme or
Ordinary inherent Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction independent on, underived from
the munisicence of Christian Emperors and Kings, especially if we consider,
that in the Apostolical Churches, and those next succeeding them in the purest

That they were all of equal authority, who by a common council and consent, did
feed, instruct, watch over, and take care of their Churches. that they were

Jurisdiction and Courts are or ought to be derived, as the Statutes of 37 H 8.
c. 17. and 1 E. 6. cap. 2. and other Acts resolve.

The 6th. Gospel Title given to them, is that of Elder, or Presbyter; 1 Timothy 5.
1. 19. 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2. 2 John 1. 3. John 1. Tit. 1. 5. Jam. 5. 14. Rev. 4. 10.
Acts 10. 17. c. 15. 2, 4, 6, 22, 23. c. 16. 4. Acts 21. 18. c. 23. 14. Which
being the same in substance with that of Bishop, has no supreme Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction, but only a directive, not coercive Authority or dominion included
in it, as St. Peter resolves, 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3.

The 7th. Title given them, is that of 2 Cor. 5. 29, 20, 21.
Ambassadors for Christ, to whom he has committed the word of reconciliation,
beseeching men as if God did entreat them (by their Embassy) to be reconciled
to God, who has made Christ to be sin for us, who had no sin, that we
might be made the righteousness of God by him. But this supplicatory Office,
carrying no Jurisdiction, but beseechings and intreatings along with it,
derives no Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction at all, (much less Supreme) to any who
enjoy it; and its the same in substance with the Title of an Apostle.

The 8th. Title is that of a Minister, a Minister of God, a Minister of Christ,
a Minister of the Gospel, by whom we believe; given to Apostles, Bishops,
Elders, and all other dispensers of the Gospel, Acts 26. 16. Romans 15. 16.
Ephesians. 3. 7. c. 6. 21 1 Cor. 3. 5. c. 4. 1. 2 Cor. 3. 6. c. 6. 4. c. 11. 23.
Col. 1. 7, 23, 25. c. 4. 7. 1 These. 3. 2. 1 Timothy: 4. 6. Whence the office is
styled a Ministry, Ministration, and Ministering, 2 Cor. 3. 7, 8, 9. c. 4. 1. c.
5. 18. c. 6. 3. c. 9. 13. Rom: 12. 17. Ephesians. 4. 12. Col. 4. 17. 1 Timothy: 1. 12. 2 Timothy 4. 5, 11. Hebr: 8. 6. Now as this Title was attributed to the Priests,
Levites, and others in the Old Testament, without any Jurisdiction. Ezra 7. 24.
c. 8. 17. Ps. 103. 21. Ps. 104. 4. Isay 61. 6. Jer. 33. 21. Ezech: 44. 11. c.
45. 4, 5. c. 46. 24. Joel 1. 9, 13. c. 2. 17. Heb: 8. 2. So it signifies
nothing but a servant, and their office but a mere service, without the least
appurtinent of Jurisdiction, Sovereignty, Power, Dominion over those to whom
they are Ministers; as is evident by Matthew: 20. 16. Mar. 10. 43. Luke 4. 20.
Acts 13. 5. Exodus 24. 13. 2 Cor. 3. 4. c. 9. 1. Heb: 1. 14. 1 Pet. 4. 11. Ezech.
44. 11. 15, 16, 17. 27. and sundry other Texts.

The 9th. Title is the same in effect with that of Minister, to wit, Romans 1. 1.
c. 16 2 Cor. 9. 17. Col. 4. 12. Tit. 1. 1. Lu. 16. 1, 2, etc.
A Servant of Jesus Christ, servants of the Church, and their servants for
Jesus sake; Paul's usual style in his Epistles, and Peter's and Judes in their
Epistles. Now as this Title is usually given throughout the Scrpture to every
Christian, servant, and other Ministers of the lowest rank; so it imports only
inferiority and subjection to their Lords and Masters, not Sovereignty or
Jurisdiction inconsistent in and with a servant, Mat: 20. 27, John 13. 16. Mat.
24. 50. c. 25. 21.

Alva^us Pelagius de Planctu Eccles. l. 2. Artic. 13.
Pope Gregory the 1. being the most humble, was the first Pope who (out of
humility) styled himself not only a Servant, but, Servus servorum Dei, in all
his Letters, by whose example other succeeding Popes gave themselves this Title
of humility, which was inserted into their ancient Laws and Decrees, but not
in their new, as Alvarus Pelagius observes; who informs us, That the Pope
styles himself thus, because he is the servant of Peter and Paul; and that he
is called a Servant, 1. Because he makes himself the servant of all, (like
Paul) that he might gain all. 2ly. Propter laborem and sollicitudinem quam
sustinet pro omnibus, sicut Servus. 3ly. Quia sicut per Servum acquiritur
Domino, sic per Papam cuilibet Ecclesiae potest acquiri. But this Servus
servorum is now asserted to be, Rex Regum, and Dominus Dominorum. And that
which Cause. 1. qu. 3. and Distinct. 73.
St. Bernard thus decried; De Consid. ^. 2.
Absit a te, Nunquid hoc, quia Summus Pontifex, ideo summus? hoc enim illorum
est, qui dignitates virtutes putant. Augustis relinquito illam sententiam,
aliisque qui divinis coli honoribus non timent, viz. Nabuchodonosor, Alexandro,
Anticho, Herodi; is now become the Popes usual darling Title, which occasioned
these two Verses: Gloss. in Gratian cause. 1. qu. 7. Alvarus Pelagius, l. 2.
A^t. 13.
Servierant tibi Roma prius Domini Dominorum:
Servorum servi NUNC TIBI SUNT DOMINI.


The 10th. Title is 1 Cor. 5. 1, 2. 1 Pet. 2. 10. Lu. 12. 42, 43. Tit. 1. 7.
Lu. 16 1, 2, etc.
Stewards, and dispensers of the mysteries and manifold graces of God, and
their office is styled a Stewardship, to give the household and their fellow
servants their meat in due season; not to beat, abuse, domineer over, or
enslave them. Now a Steward being but a servant, imports not the least dram of
Jurisdiction or Dominion.

The 11th. is that of Hebr. 5. 1. c. 8. 3. c. 9. 9. c. 10. 38.
Priest, (which Protestants allow of as a contract of Presbyter, but utterly
disallow as used by the Church of Rome, for a sacrificing Priest) unless in
respect of such spiritual sacrifices of Prayer, Praise, Alms, and offering up
our own souls and bodies to God; Romans 12. 1. Ephesians. 5. 2. Phil. ^. 18. c. 2. 17.
Now this Title in this spiritual sense, is common to every Christian, as well
as to Popes, Bishops and Presbyters: Witness 1 Pet. 2. 9. But ye are a chosen
generation, a Royal Priesthood, an holy Nation, etc. (as all the Elect and
Saints of God are there styled) Rev. 1. 4. 7. where St. John writes thus to the
7. Churches in Asia. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his
blood, and has made us Kings and Priests unto God his Father. Rev. 5. 9, 10.
Those whom Christ had redeemed with his blood out of every tongue, language and
Nation, sing this New song unto him that sits on the throne, Thou art worthy,
etc. For thou have made us unto our God, Kings and Priests; Rev. 20. 6. Blessed
and holy is he, that has part in the first Resurrection, on such the second
death has no power, but they shall be Priests God and of Christ. From which
Texts, In Exhortat: ad Castitatum.
Tertullian thus argued. Nonne and Lalci Sacerdotes sumus? Regnum quoque nos et
Sacerdotes Deo and Patri suo fecit. In Luc. 1.
St. Ambrose resolves, Omnes filii Ecclesiae Sacerdotes sunt. In Malach. c. 1.
St. Hierom determines, Genus Sacerdotale and Regale sumus omnes, qui baptizati
in Christo, Christi censemur nomine. Which In 2 Cor. Hom. 3.
St. Chrysostom thus backs, Et tu in baptismo, and Rex essiceris, and Sacerdos,
and Propheta: adding, St. Peter calls the whole Church of Christ, A Kingly
Priesthood. In Evang. ^. 1. c. 10. De Civit: Dei, l. 20. c. 10.
St. Augustine concludes, Hoc Sacerdotio Regali, consecrantur omnes pertinentes
ad corpus Christi, Summi and very Principis Sacerdotum: Omnes sunt sacerdotes,
quia membra sunt unius Sacerdotis: Yea Reges sunt and Sacerdotes omnes electi.

St. Bernard, Marlorat, Calvin, Fox, Beza, etc. Bp: Jewels Defense of the
Apology, part: 1. c. 11. divis. 4. 5. p. 113 114.
most Commentators and all Protestant Divines from these Texts resolve, That
every faithful Christian is after a spiritual and ghostly manner, both a
Priest to offer up spiritual Sacrifices unto God, and likewise a King, to rule
over his sins and corruptions. Therefore Mr. Hardings inference from this Text
of Peter, That the Pope being a Bishop, may be a King, But on the other side, a
King may in no wise be a Bishop or Priest. That the Priesthood which is the
greater, may contain the Kingship being the less; but not e converso, And
Dormers inference thence: You are a Kingly Priesthood, as who should say, the
Priesthood before was not Kingly; for that their Kings (under the Law) Here,
Fol. 40. Bishop Jewel, ib. p. 711 712, 713, 714.
ruled over Priests; but now is the Priesthood Kingly, for that to it be
subject even Kings themselves; So that unless the Pope, yea every Popish
Priest may rule over Kings and Princes as their Lords paramount, and that in
Temporals as well as Spirituals, and all the world at their pleasures, they
think they are no Kingly Priestood) must needs vanish into smoke; since not
only every Christian King, but private Christian, is as much; as really a
Spiritual Priest and King too, by St. Peter's and St. John's resolutions, as the
Pope, or St. Peter himself: Especially if we believe De Potest. Regali, and
Papali, c. 18.
Johannes de Parisiis his decision; Sacerdotium dicitur Regale, a Regno, non
hujus mundi sed coeli; and the Gloss on Distinctio 10.
Gratian, from St. Cyprians resolution; Christus actibus propriis and
Dignitatibus distinctis potestates utriusque discrevit. Hinc est argumentum,
(as the Gloss resolves) quod Papa non habet utrumque gladium; or at least it
evidenceth, that every private Christian being both a Spiritual King and
Priest, has both swords as well as the Pope; who upon this account can have no
superior Spiritual or Temporal Jurisdiction over them, since Gratian Did. 65.
Par in parem non habet Imperium.

To cloze up this Chapter, I can discover (upon serious disquisition) nothing
in all or any of the Evangelical Commissions or Titles given to the Apostles or
Ministers of the Gospel, that can invest St. Peter, or any other Apostle, Pope,
Bishop, Presbyter, Minister, Priest, with Supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction
or Dominion, much less advance the Pope to such a transcendent superiority
over the whole Church, all Bishops, yea Emperors, Kings themselves, as now they
exercise, prescribe, expect by their very Caeremoniale, wherein they inform us;
Caeremoniale Romanum. l. 3. c. 2.
Papa nemini omnino mortalium reverentiam facit assurgendo manifest, aut Caput

side, the Emperor himself when he is to be crowned by the Pope, Sacrarum

Imperatrix Coronata mox osculatur pedem Pontificis. Moreover the Emperor
himself, like a Groom of the Popes Stable, or Footman, must hold the Popes
stirrup, and lead his horse, (as Pepin did to Pope Stephen, and Frederick to
Pope Hadrian, and as Constantine the Great did to Pope Silvester, if we credit
Mr. Harding.) If more Kings be present, then the more worthy King must lead the
Popes horse on the right side, and the other on the left. And if he be not
pleased to ride, then four of the greatest Kings (whereof the Emperor to be
one, if present) must bear the Popes chair on their shoulders, and the Pope
sitting therein. At his feast: the Emperor, or greatest King, must bring water
to wash his hands; they must carry the first dish of meat and set it on his
Table. At his Coronation, two Cardinal Deacons must hold up the sides of his
Pluviale, or loose upper Garment; and the Emperor, or in his absence, two of
the chiefest Kings must hold up the tail thereof. If they happen to offend the
Pope, they must dance attendance barefooted at the Popes gates, as Lambert.

justifying this his proud insulting over him, by a blasphemous wresting of this
sacred Text, Thou shall tread upon the Adder and the Basili^k. And when the

Pope retorted, et Mihi et Petro: Yea Polychron, l. 7. c. 26. Centur. Magd. 12.

Caelestine the 3d. when he crowned Henry the 3d. Emperor, and had set the
Imperial Crown on his head, which he bowed down to him, the proud Pope sitting
in his chair, Statim pede in terram excussit, presently struck the Crown off
his head with his foot to the ground; designans per hoc, quod ipse Papa haberet
potestatem coronandi Imperatorem, si meruerat, and dejiciendi si demeruerit.

usurped a power to give all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,
to Christ, if he would thus fall down unto him and worship him, as Kings and

Apostolatu primus erat, sic etiam in humilitate. I wish Popes (who pretend
themselves to be St. Peter's successors, disclaiming all their premised
Luciferian Ceremonies, Services, Exorbitances) with all other Bishops and
Clergymen, may from henceforth demonstrate themselves to be Christ's real
Disciples, Apostles, successors, exceeding all others in humility, by
preaching, diligence in the Ministry, not in the usurpation of such
Ecclesiastical Authority, for which they have neither precept nor president in
the Gospel, as the premises demonstrate. I shall cloze up this Chapter with St.
De Consid. lib. 2*
Bernards words to Eugenius, which I cordially desire all ambitious Popes and
Prelates seriously to consider: En quis es: sed noli oblivisci etiam, quid?
Quid desinas intueri, quod non desiisti esse? Hoc ergo consulo; consideres
maxim, quod maximus es; hominem videlicet, quod and natus es. Toll ergo nunc
haereditaria haec perizomata ab initio maledicta. Dirumpe, velamen foliorum
celantium ignominiam, nec plagam curantium. Dele fucum fugacis honoris hujus,
and malae coloratae nitorem gloriae; et unde es nude nudum consideres, quia
Job. 1.
nudus egressus es de utero matris tuae. Nunquid infulatus, nunquid micans
gemmis, aut floridus sericis, aut coronatus pennis, aut suffarcinatus metallis?
Si cuncta haec veluti nubes quasdam matutinales velociter transeuntes, and cito
pertransituras dissipes and exsuffles a facie considerationis tuae, occuret
tibi homo nudus and pauper, and miserabilis; Homo dolens, quod homo sit;
erubescens, quod nudus sit, plorans quod natus sit, murmurans quod sit, Job. 5.
Homo natus ad laborem, non ad honorem. Homo natus de muliere, and ab hoc cum
reatu; brevi vivens tempore, ideoque cum metu; repletus multis miseriis,
ideoque cum fletu: and vere multis, qu^^ corporis and animae simul. Proinde si
consideras quantus es; cogita etiam qualis; and maxim. Haec te sane
consideratio tenet in te, nec te avolare sinit, nec Psalm. 230.

BOOK I. CHAP. V.
That Gods principal end and intention in ordaining Kings and Supreme Civil
Magistrates in the world, was not the bare external administration of Justice
between man and man, the protection of their Subjects from violence,
oppression, the preservation of them in wordly peace, plenty, prosperity; the
punishment of Malefactors, rewarding of well-doers, encouragement of Arts,
Virtue, Trade, industry, or fighting their battles in times of War against
Invading Enemies; though considerable parts of their Regal Office and Sovereign
Authority: But the advancement of Gods Honor, Worship, Service, Glory, and
spiritual Kingdom, whose Vice-royes they are; the suppression of all Idolatry,
blasphemy, sin, wickedness, the promotion of the eternal salvation, felicity
of their people, and to be Kings for the Lord their God, by advancing his
interest all they can. Upon which ground (in order to effect these ends) God
himself, as well under the Gospel as Law, has delegated the Supreme
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction only to Kings and other Sovereign Temporal
Potentates; not to Popes, Bishops, Priests, who are subordinate to them as
their Subjects, not Copartners with them in their sovereign Ecclesiastical
Authority in point of Interest; nor yet in its actual execution, no further
then they are pleased by their Laws and Commissions to delegate it to them as
their Substitutes. With a specification of the chief particulars wherein this
Supreme Ecclesiastical Power of Christian Kings and Emperors consists.

Popes and Popish Prelates have robbed Christian Emperors, Kings, Princes,
Magistrates of their Supreme Ecclesiastical Authority, and monopolized it to
themselves alone, is this gross Paradox and Imposture; That God and Jesus
Christ under the Gospel, have committed to their trust, care, only, the
Administration, Government of the Commonwealth and Secular, not of the Church
and Religious affairs; of the bodies, temporal estates of their Subjects, not
of their Souls, for which they are not to give any account at all to God; and,
That the Government, care, reformation of the Church, Religion, divine Worship,
and their Subjects souls, are by Christ's institution wholly and solely
delegated to Popes, Bishops, Priests, and other Ecclesiastical persons, not to
Emperors, Kings, or Supreme Civil Magistrates. Upon which notorious Forgery,

Princeps est Summus Pontifex, qui est Monarcha Ecclesiasticus.

The clearing of this Proposition will give a fatal and final overthrow to all
these Papal, Pontifical Sacerdotal Paradoxes, and Pretenses; In Order
thereunto, I shall desire you to take special notice of what Alvarus Pelagius,
l. 1. Artic. 40.
Alvarus Pelagius confesses, asserteth; Quod Politia unius Civitatis est
Politia unius Principatus, nec possunt esse plures Principes Regentes in una
Civitate. Quod omnes illi qui eodem signo and charactere, consignantur, and
eisdem legibus eiusdem Legislatoris subjiciuntur, ad eundem Principem
pertinent. Quod omnes Christianae Religionis, sunt eiusde Principatus, etc.
Quod Principatus civilis non distinguitur a Principatu Ecclesiastico, sicut una
species ab alia, sed sicut parts integrales unius Principatus, etc. Nec potest
dici, quod Christiani sunt unius principatus quantum ad spiritualia, and
alterius quantum ad corporalia and temporalia, quia nullus Princeps vel
Subditus Christianus potest aliquid lic^^e possidere vel acquirere nisi in eo
qui militat sub Principatu Christiano. Ex quo liquido patet, quod civilitas
Christiana et politia et quantum ad spiritualia, et quantum ad temporalia ad
eundem Principatum pertinet. Et hoc clamat tota sacra scriptura, quod sumus
omnes Christi fideles una communitas et unus populus, nos et nostri profecto
qui nos sectantur; una enim fides, unus Principatus, et una Ecclesia collectio
fidelium, Ephesians. 4. Vi^o autem quod politia Ecclesiastica sit (...) una, tunc
facile est videre, quod unus est Princeps regens et dirigens eam, quia
pluralitas Principatuum non est bona, ut dicitur 13 Metaphysic. In una ergo
politia, unus Princeps, ut preca in apibus, quia diversitas Principatuum,
divisio regni et politiae est, ^t materia guerrae et divisionis, Mat. 12. Lu.
11. Omne regnum, etc. Cause. 25. qu. 2. Si ea: Nec poteit dici quid sit unus
Princeps in ratione (...), and (...) in ratione agenus et moventis: quia ^icut
declaratur 2 Metaphys. in quo^^^^ genere causae oporter unum primum dare ad
quod omnia posteriora reducantu^: Et ita oportet in Principatu Christiano esse
unum priorem Princip^m regentem et moventem sive gubernantem totam politiam.
Praeterea pouere plures Principes non subalternos regentes et moventes eosdem
subditos, unum videlicet ratione spiritualium, et alium ratione temporalium,
est facere ordinem illius politiae incounerum, et non stabilem; quia interdum
contingit Principem corporatium praecipere pugnare, and Principem spiritualium
prohibere illum pugnam, ut tota die contingit inter Christianos. Ista ratio
op^me probatur 19. Did. ita Dominus. Contingit etiam illos duos Dominos et
Principes eodem tempore pracipere diversa; ut unus praecip^et (...) ad agrum,
alius ad ecclesiam, quae in eodem tempore non possant fieri; quia nemo potest
duobus dominis servire, Mat. 6. and Luc. 16. ^^ubaudi contrariis. Quare
sequitur ordinem, talis politiae esse inconnerum et non stabilem, quod est
inconveniens. Hoc etiam potest manifestari e^ unitate finis: Omnes enim de
civilitate Christiana ad eundem finem, et sub eadem ratione ordinantur,
scilicet ad gratiam, charitatem and unitatem, quae sunt vincula perfectionis in
via, Col. 3. Ephesians. 4. Et ad finalem beaticudinem in patria ubi est illa unitas
de qua Psalm. 121. de que Augustinus; non erit ibi aliqua invidia disparis
claritatis, ubi in omnibus regnat unitas charitatis: and ^e qua Gregorius,
Tanta vis charitatis omnes sibi ibi ass^ci^^, ut bonum quod quisq ^e in se non
accepit, in alio se gaudeat accepisse: Sed cuilibet uni sini correspondet, unum
age^^ dirigens in finem illum; plura enim agentia distincta specie et natura,
non habentia ordinem ad manum, non possunt dirigere ad unum finem sub una
ratione. Ergo in civitate, Christiana debet esse un^^ primus Princeps, dirigens
emnes ejusdem politiae ad finem proprium ejus. Et sicut unus homo (secundum
Augustinum) primo creatus est, ut in eo et ex eo constitueretur una creatura,
ut Cause. 33. qu. 5. Ita unus rector principalis totius illius naturae, qui came
deducat ad unum Deum qui creavit eum, Genesis 1. Thus far his reasons are solid;
evidencing the Supreme Government of Christ over the whole Church, whereof he,
not the Pope, is the head, to be incommunicable; and the government of every
particular visible Church on earth in each kingdom, to be vested only in one
King, and Sovereign Prince, not in the Pope, Prelates, Clergy, ^or divided
between them both, and quite subverts his conclusion thence: Quod (...) primus
and supremus Princeps est Summus Pontifex; especially if compared with his
Passages in De (...) Ecclesiae, l. ^^. c. 62.
another Article, defining the greatest good, eternal happiness and be (...)
not wordly glory, wealth greatness, to be the chiefest end, aim and reward of
all good Kings; where he thus describes the duty, office of a King: Quid sit
Regis officium? and (...) Regem? Quantum ad officium, ita sit Rex in Regno,
sicut ratio in corpore et anima, et sicut Deus in mundo: quae si diligenter
consideret Rex, ex altero in eo justitia accen^itur, dum considerat ad hoc se
p^^um, ut loco Dei iudicium in regno exerceat (Cause. 24. qu. 5. Regum) ex
al^^ro vero clementiae and (...) lenitatem acqu^ra^, dum (...) singulos qui suo
subsunt regimini sicut propria (...) Augustinus ad Marcellinum Comitem, ^^ple

non in peccatorum acrocitatibus exerceas ulc^cendi libidinem, sed peccatorum
vulneribus curandi adhibeas voluntatem: no^ perdere pater^^^ diligentiam quam
in ipsa inquisitione servasti. Officium autem principale Regum est (mark it)
dirigere suum regimen in finem bonum, qui est beatitudo aeterna: Vnde sic
debent suos subditos in hoc mundo peregrinos regere, Nota.
ut efficiantur Cives et Domestici Dei, Ephesians. 2. Qui^ (...) in corpore
peregrinamur a Domino, 2 Cor. 5. Sed quia finem (...) divinae homo non
consequitur per virtutem humanam sed divinam, quia gratia Dei (...), Romans 6.
perducere ad illum ultimum finem, non est humani per se regiminis, sed divi^i.
Ad illum ergo Regem hoc pertinet principaliter, qui non solum est homo, sed
etiam Deus, scilicet Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum, qui homines Dei filios
faciens, in coelestem gloriam introducit, propter quod non solum Sacerdos sed
et Rex in sacro eloquio nominatur. Hier. 23. This then being the principal end,
office of Kings, according to my Proposition, I now proceed to evidence the
truth thereof, which will appear,

1. By Col. 1. 16. For by him (Jesus Christ) were all things created, that are
in heaven, (...) that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be
Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities or Powers, all things were created by
him, and for him, that is, to promote his honor, glory, kingdom, Gospel,
worship, interest. Compared with Romans 11. 36. For of him, and through him, and
to him are all things. Rev. 4. 11. Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory
and honor, and power, for thou have created all things, and for thy pleasure
(or service) they are and were created. Prove. 16. 4. The Lord has made all
things for himself (that is, to set forth his glory, service, worship, praise,
Isay 43. 7. 21. Ps. 95. 6, 7.) Therefore much more Kings: who as they reign by
him, Prove. 8. 15. upon that account they should and ought principally to reign
and rule for him, his glory, worship, service, and their subjects salvation.

2ly. By Romans 13. 1, 2, 3, 4. Let every soul be subject to the higher powers:
for there is no power but of God: tho powers that are are ordained of God, etc.
Do that which is good and thou shall have praise of the same. For he is the
Minister of God to thee for good, (that is, for thy eternal good and salvation,
as well as temporal good,) but if thou do that which is evil, be afraid, for
he bears not the sword in vain; for he is the Minister of God, an avenger to
execute wrath upon him that does evil, (to reclaim him from his evil, and
others by his punishment) thereby to bring him and others to repentance, and
save their souls; as Chrysostom, Haymo, Theophylact, Paraeus, Willet, Grotius,
Soto, with other Commentators on the Text, and Grotius, De Jure Belli and
Pacis, lib. 2. cap. 20. de Poenis, resolve:

3. By 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. I exhort therefore, that first of all
supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made, for Kings, and
for all that are in authority, that we may live a quiet and peaceablelife in
all godliness and honesty; for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God
our Savior, who would have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge
of the truth. The chief end of Kings and Magistrates institution by God, being
to advance godliness in and among all their subjects in the first place, and
then quietness, peace, honesty in the second.

4ly. By Rev. 21. 24. Where St. John describing the glory and beauty of the
heavenly Jerusalem, to wit, of Christ's Church and its glory under the Gospel;
subjoyns, And the Nations of them that are saved shall walk in the light of it;
and the Kings of the Earth do bring their Glory and Honor to it: this being the
principal end for which they were made Kings, to contribute all their Regal
Honor, Power to enlarge the bounds of Christ's Church, kingdom; promote Gods
honor, worship, glory, and salvation of the Nations, people committed to their
Government.

5ly. Natural Parents, as well under the Gospel as Deutr. 6. 7. c. 11. 19, 20,
21. c. 32, 46.
Law, are enjoined, to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of
the Lord, and knowledge of the Scriptures, Ephesians. 6. 4. 1. 2 Timothy 3. 15. And
natural Husbands are obliged, to instruct and sanctify, as well as love and
nourish their wives, 1 Cor. 7. 14. c. 14. 35. Therefore Kings and supreme
Christian Magistrates, (the Politic Fathers and Husbands of the Commonwealth)
are also obliged to bring up their Children, Wives, Subjects in the fear and
admonition of the Lord, to see them instructed in Gods word, and endeavor
their real sanctification and salvation. To these Arguments, evidences out of
the New Testament, I shall accumulate many more out of the Old.

6ly. That memorable Speech of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon, 2 Chronicles. 9.
8. (most punctual and observable to our purpose;) And she said to the King,
Blessed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee; to set thee on his Throne,
to be King for the Lord thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish
them for ever, therefore made he thee a King over Israel, to do judgment and
justice. In which speech (even of an Heathen Queen from the very light of
Nature) there are these memorable particulars: 1. That the Thrones of all
Kings, are not their own, but Gods alone. 2ly. That it is God himself who sets
Kings upon his throne. 3ly. That the grand end thereof is, To be Kings for the
Lord their God, who has set them on his own throne to be his Viceroyes; to
promote his Glory, worship, honor, kingdom, interest in the world, (as Solomon
did) and suppress what ever is opposite thereunto. 4ly. To establish their
Subjects, people for ever by setting up, establishing Gods true Worship,
Ordinances, Statutes, Gospel amongst them, for their eternal salvation, and by
executing Judgment and Justice over them, to the Psalm. 101. 3. to the end.
encouraging piety, holiness, virtue, godliness, all good works, and cutting
off all the wicked of the Land from the City of God, left they should corrupt
others, and dishonor God by impunity.

7ly. This is most apparent by Gods primitive instituting the Here, p. 3, 4.
Firstborn of every Family, and Kings themselves before the Law, to be not
only Kings, but Priests too, as Melchisedech and others were: And the very
Romans, Grecians, with other Pagan Nations creating their Kings, Emperors (by
the very light of Nature) to be their high Priests likewise, as I have Here, p.
3, 4.
formerly proved by sundry Testimonies; and De Planctu Eccles. lib. 1. Artic.
13. 62. 66
Alvarus Pelagius, Lyra in Genesis 14. Numb. 3. 12. and 8. 16. Bellarmin De Romano
Pontifice, with other Romanists; His ^urisdiction Regal, Episcopal, Papal, chapter
2.
Bishop Carlton, and sundry Protestants attest with one consent. Because the
care of Religion and Gods worship, the instruction, edification, salvation and
eternal felicity of all their Subjects souls, did principally belong to them,
as a part of, or appendant to their Regal dignity.

8ly. This truth is at large demonstrated by all the particulars I have Here,
p. 8. to 18.
formerly insisted on in the Second Chapter, relating to Moses, Joshua, David,
Solomon, Asa, Jehoshaphat and Josiah; as likewise, of the Kings of Assyria,
Cyrus, Darius, Artaxerxes, Nebuchadnezzar, and the King of Niniveth, which I
shall not repeat. All Kings and supreme Magistrates under the Gospel, having
the self-same authority, charge, Psalm. 2. Isay.
trust, to promote, preserve the purity, syncerity of Gods worship, suppress
Idolatry, Blasphemy, Heresy, all sorts of sins against the first and second
Tables; and endeavor the instruction, salvation, and eternal welfare of their
Subjects, as they had under the Law; the ends, uses, grounds of Kingly and
Magistratical institution, Government under the Gospel, continuing still the
same as they were before and under the Law, and being all moral, perpetual, not
ceremonial.

9ly. This is most perspicuous by this precept given to all Kings by the King
of Kings, Here, p. 30.
Psalm. 2. 10, 11, 12. Be wise now therefore, O ye Kings, be instructed ye
Judges of the earth; Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice unto him with
trembling; Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the right way.
(Which they cannot do as Kings, unless they command their Subjects to do it
likewise;) Compared with these prophecies concerning Christian Kings under the
Gospel, Psalm 72. 2, 10. The Kings of Tarshish and of the Isles shall bring
presents, the Kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts, Yea all Kings shall
fall down before him; (and by their example and Regal authority) all Nations
shall serve him. Psalm. 138. 4, 5. All the Kings of the earth shall praise thee,
O Lord, when they shall hear the words of thy mouth, yea they shall sing in the
praises of the Lord, for great is the glory of the Lord. Isay 49. 22, 23.
Behold I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the
people, etc. And Kings shall be thy Nursing-Fathers, and Queens thy Nursing
mothers; they shall bow to thee with their faces toward the earth, and lick up
the dust of thy feet: Kings shall see and arise, Princes also shall worship:
Compared with Isay 41. 1, 2. c. 52. 15, c. 60. 1, 10, 11, 16. c. 62. 5. The
Gentiles shall come to thy Light, and Kings to the brightness of thy rising:
The Kings of the sons of Strangers shall come unto thee, unto thee the rulers
of the Gentiles and their Kings shall be brought, etc. And Psalm. 148. 11, 12.
Praise the Lord from the earth, ye Kings of the earth (in the first place, and
then by their examples and edicts) Princes and all Judges of the earth, both
young men and maidens, old men and children, let them praise the name of the
Lord, this being the prime end of their creation, and Gods instituting Kings,
Princes and Judges in the earth, both before and under the Gospel.

10ly. This is most persp^cuous by the example of Jesus Christ himself, the
King of Kings, of whom as Davis, Solomon, and other forecited Kings of Judah
were types, under the Law, so himself is the president, pattern for all
Christian Kings under the Gospel: Now the principal end, scope of the Kingly
Authority, power, (...) of Jesus Christ, is the propagation Isay 9 2. 6, 7. c.
32. 1. to 6. Psalm. 2. and 110. Mat. 25. 34. Col. 1. 13. 1 Timothy 4. 18. Hebr. 11.
28. 1. Rev. 12. 10 Jam. 2. 5. Ephesians 2, 1, to 22 c. 4. 10 to 19.
of Gods Kingdom, Gospel, worship, glory; the destruction of the Kingdoms of
Satan, sin, and all kind of wickedness, error, heresy, (...), and the
conversion, sanctification, salvation, eternal beatitude of his Subjects souls,
that they may reign for ever with him in his heavenly kingdom in endless
felicity: Therefore it is and ought to be the principal end, aim, office, duty
of all Christian Kings, who are his Viceroyes, and 1 John 2. 6. 2
ought to imitate his example.

11ly This I shall more specially and peculiarly evidence by some few texts and
examples: 1. By Genesis 18. 18, 19. Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
Nation, and all the Nations of the earth shall be blessed in him; For I know
him, that he will command his children are household after him, that they shall
keep the way of the Lord, to do Justice and Judgment; that the Lord may bring
upon Abraham that which he has spoken. Abraham's (...) care (being then a Genesis
23. 6.
mighty Prince over his great and numerous family; and to become a great and
mighty Nation) was, to instruct and command his children and household after him
to keep the way of the Lord, that so they and all the Nations of the earth
might be blessed in him. 2ly. By the whole Book of Deuteronomy, especially chapter
4. and 5. and 6. and 26. and 28. to 34. where Moses, (the supreme Governor of
Gods own people Israel) with all earnestness, exhorts and presses them to
keep, do and observe all Gods commandments, judgments and statutes, that they
might fear the Lord their God, and love and serve him with all their heart, and
with all their soul, and with all their might, they and their sons, and their
sons (...), all the days of their life; that it might be well with them, and
their children after them for ever, etc. This day the Lord thy God has
commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments; thou shall therefore keep
and do them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul; thou have avouched the
Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes
and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice; And
the Lord has avouched thee to be his people, and that thou should keep all
his commandments; and to make thee high above all Nations which he has made,
in praise, and in name, and in honor, and that thou may be an holy people
unto the Lord thy God, as he has spoken. This is the chief end of Gods
instituting Kings and Magistrates in the earth, to make their subjects an holy
people to the Lord their God. 3ly. By Joshua his last Speech and Exhortation to
the children of Israel and their chief Heads and Officers before God, Josh. 23.
24. where he severally charges them, To fear the Lord, and to serve him in
sincerity and truth; to put away the gods which their fathers served on the
other side of Jordan, and in Egypt, and to serve the Lord their God which
brought them and their fathers out of the land of Egypt, etc. Whereupon all the
people resolved and answered again and again, The Lord our God will we serve,
and his voice will we obey, and they made a statute, ordinance, and covenant
before the Lord to perform it: compared with Joshua 22. 11. to 34. 4ly. By King
David's manifold exhortations and precepts to his Subjects to this purpose
throughout the Psalms: especially Psalm 34. and 37. O magnify the Lord with
me, and let us exalt his name together: O taste and see that the Lord is good;
blessed is the man that trusts in him. O fear the Lord ye his Saints. Come ye
children and hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Depart
from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it, and dwell for evermore, etc.
And by his charge to his son Solomon, all his Princes, Officers, and
Congregation of Isrel, 1 Chronicles. 28. 9, 10. Now therefore in the sight of all
Israel, the congregation of the Lord, and in the audience of our God, keep and
search for all the commandments of the Lord your God, that ye may posses this
good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for
ever. And thou Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy Fathers, and serve
him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind; for the Lord searches all
hearts, and understands the imagination of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he
will be found of thee; but if thou shall forsake him, he will cast thee off for
ever. Seconded with this his public prayer to God for them, 1 Chronicles. 29. 18,
19, 20. O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel our Fathers, keep this for
ever in the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto
thee; And give unto Solomon my Son an understanding heart to keep thy
commandments, thy testimonies and statutes, and to do all these things, and to
build the house for which I have made provision: Which ended, David said to all
the Congregation, Now bless the Lord your God. And all the congregation
blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and bow^d down their heads and
worshipped the Lord and the King. 5ly. By Ecclesiastes 1. 12: c. 12. 9, 10, 11.
recording, that Solomon King of Israel was also a Preacher, and taught the
people knowledge, and that which was upright, even words of truth, for their
everlasting welfare. 6ly. By 2 Chronicles. 15. 12. to 19. Where King Asa made the
people to enter into a covenant, to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all
their heart, and with all their soul: and that whosoever would not seek the
Lord God of Israel should be put to death whether great or small, whether man
or woman.

To omit all other particular examples of this nature already touched: From
these Texts it is apparent, That the primary office, duty, end of Kings,
(especially Christian) is to promote the honor, worship, service, fear, love
of God, true religion, eternal salvation of their Subjects souls, and suppress
what ever is repugnant thereto.

12ly. That which was Gods principal end, design in creating the World it self,
redeeming mankind by the blood of Jesus Christ, and the King of Kings giving
both the Law and Gospel to men, must certainly be Gods chief end, design in
instituting Kings, Princes and Supreme Civil Governors, the eminentest,
chiefest of men, to be his Viceroyes to rule over men of inferior rank or
quality; and the most essential, real considerable part of their Regal or
Magistratical office, duty. Now Gods principal end and design in creating the
world, and men, (the Lords of all other Creatures) redeeming mankind by the
blood of Christ, and giving both the Law and Gospel to them, was only this,
that all Isay 43. 41. Ps. 95, and 100. Rev. 1. 5, 6. c. 4. 10, 11. c. 5. 9, to
14. 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3.
mankind might worship, adore, fear, honor, praise, bless, obey, love and
glorify him according to his word and will, whiles they live on earth, that
Jesus Christ might rule in, and reign over them, as his kingdom, Church,
Saints, and they might reign with, and enjoy perpetual felicity in, by, under
him in his heavenly kingdom for all eternity, as the Scripture resolves:
Therefore it must necessarily be Gods chief end, design, in instituting Kings,
Princes, and Supreme Civil Magistrates (the eminentest, choicest of all men) to
rule over those of inferior quality, and the most essential, real,
considerable part of their Regal or Magisterial office, trust, duty; upon which
Account, among others, God specially enjoined the Kings of Israel, to have a
Deuteronomy. 17. 18, 19, 20. c. 30 10. Josh. 1. 7, 8, 9. c. 23. 2. 6. c. 24 22. to 29
Neh. 8. 1, to 18. Bishop Jewels Defense of the Apology, 6 part chapter 11. divis.
3. p. 709, 710, 757.
Copy of the Book of his Law always in their custody, and to read therein all
the days of their lives, the better to observe it themselves, and to enjoin
all their subjects to observe, obey, and do naught against it; yea God himself
with greatest majesty enacted this Royal Law by King David's own mouth, for all
Kings, Rulers to square their Government by; 2 Samuel 23. 1, 2, 3.
He that rules over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God; which he can
never do, without taking special care to maintain, promote the true Worship,
service, fear, love, obedience of God according to his word, among all his
Subjects, for Gods glory, and their temporal and eternal felicity, as David did.

13ly. This I shall evidence even from the very light of nature, and practice
among the Heathen Nations. Plato in his Book De Regno, asserts, That the King
has Universae humanae Societatis curam; that Regia cura, ut quae principalis,
in omnes homines ars est; consisting not only in this, that Rex est humanus
Curator, but also Divinus Pastor over all his Subjects: That the chief care of
Religion, Worship of the Gods and feeding of the people belongs to Kings, they
being a kind of Priests: Quare in Egypto neque imperare licet Regi absque
Sacerdotio. Sed si quis ex alio genere per vim Regnum invasit, postea tamen
necesse est cum hoc genere initiari. Quin et in multis locis apud Graecos
Summis Magistratibus maxima sacrificia demandata esse, quis compererit, et sane
etiam apud nos non minus clarum est quod dico. Ei enim qui Rex sort creatus
est, augustissima et maxima patria vetera sacrificia, huic attributa esse
tradunt. Hos itaque sort creatos Reges, simulque Sacerdotes considerare
convenit, etc. Politic. l. 3. cap. 10. and 11.
Aristotle his Scholar resolves us, that in the heroical times; Reges
provinciam habebant and bellorum et sacrorum, nisi forte ad Sacerdotes
attinerent: Postea autem partim quidem ipsis Regibus omittendis, partim vero
populis recusantibus; apud quasdam Civitates sacra solis Regibus relicta sunt.
Rex autem et Dux belli, et Iuder, erat rerum divinarum moderator. And among the
Romans themselves, as their Historians, and others relate; their ancient King,
and after that their Emperors, were both Kings and Priests, and had the
chiefest hand in performing the Rites and Ceremonies of their Religion, as I
See here p. 4.
have proved, and shall further evidence by this passage of Cicero de
Divinatione, lib. 1. Apud veteres qui rerum potiebantur, iidem auguria
ferebant; ut enim sapere, sic divinare Regale ducebant; ut testis est nostra
Civitas, in qua et Reges augures, et postea privati eodem Sacerdotio praediti
rem religionum auctoritate rexerunt: eaque divinationum ratio, nec in barbaris
quidem gentibus neglecta est. To which I shall subjoyn this observation of
Genialium Dierum, l. 3. c. 27.
Alexanderab Alexandro, Cum a principio urbis multa et magna sacra Reges
obirent, ad quos de religione, deque sacrificiis et ceremoniis deorum
Sacerdotes saepe consultum ibant, qui etiam rem divinam facientibus aderant, ne
bonis auspiciis coeptum confirmatumque regium nomen post exterminatos Reges
aboleretur penitus: neve de relictis sacris, regium nomen expeterent, long
antiquissimum rati, sacra quae penes Reges erant, alicui demandare; See Cicero,
Oration pro Domo sua ad Pontifices.
Regem sacrificulum crearunt, qui sacrorum Rex dictus, sine regio imperio, solo
nomine rex, sacra quaepenes reges erant obiret ac Ceremoniis praeesset, quem
creatum aut in locum decedentis suffectum, sicut reliquos sacerdotes,
inaugurari oportebat. Eratque non annuum sed perpetuum sacerdotium, immune ab
omni belli tumultu, Neque enim Rex sacrorum militare, stipendia facere, aut
castris et Legionibus praeesse poterat, propter suspectum invisumque regium
nomen; neque magistratum gerere; aut concionem habere; vel cum populo agere.
Namque eius potestas sola religione et templis tenebatur. Primus enim Manlius
Papyrius ex Patricus, Bruto Consule rex creatus fuit, cui jus sacrificandi and
de sacris decernendi reliquerunt, eumque Pontifici maximo subjecerunt; ideo in
sacris epulis, post maximum Pontificem supra Flaminem Dialem Martialem
Quirinalem accumbebat. Atque licet a principio a populo crearetur ex patriciis
and multis honoribus functis, post aliquot aetates a minore part populi
selectis, relatisque comitiis (quibus fiunt Sacerdotes) ex plebe creari coepit,
tunc cum Maximus Curio plebeius homo rex sacrorum fuit, cujus uxor regina
sacrorum hoc habet proprium, ut quoties sacra facit, ex malo punico virgulam
quam in arculum dicunt pro infula deferat, quae omnibus call. Junonis sacram
faceret eique porcum vel agnum mactare debet in regia. Ad quem vestales
virgins die constituta annis singulis ventitare, and ne sacra negligerentur,
quae suae fidei tutelaeque credita erant, praemonere solebant. Erat ergo tegis
sacrorum munus quinto Idus Jan: Jano arietem immolare, diesque fastos
praedicere, and nefastos, sacra procurare, and quae sacrificia, sui essent
ministrare. Ideo sacra facturi lanam, farra and fruges, lauros and verbenas,
quaeque sacrificio opportuna sunt, regem petunt: Adeoque tam intra quam extra
pomarium populi civesque, quique in agris agunt imperiti morum civilium, atque
una agricolae, de sacris festisque diebus, consultum vadunt, and sacra
postulant. Ipseque feriarum causas, and quid quoque mense faciendum, a
quibusque cavendum esset, praedicebat praemonebatque. Cui hoc proprium dicunt
fuisse, ut sacrificium in comitio peragat, quo perfecto nulla cunctatione vel
mora se ex foro proripiat: quando vero divinis rebus perfectis in Comitium
venit in fastis notabatur, utque Call: Martiis fores regis sacrorum, Flaminis
and Pontificis maximi nova exornentur lauro, sicut Palatinae aedes and Augustae
quercus virides nunquam lauros habuere. Cujus filiae ad sacerdotium Vestae
invitae eligi nequeunt, nam privilegio honoris ab hoc onere immunes erant;
volentes vero non vetantur. Quae autem ejusmodi sacra fuerint solis Regibus
credita.

This was the power, trust the ancient Kings amongst the Romans had in all
matters of Religion and worship of their Gods, which their Pagan Emperors
enjoyed as High Priests, till they became Christians. The like power we read of
in other Pagan Kings in Diodorus Siculus, Boemus de Moribus Gentium, Strabo,
and Purchase his Pilgrimage, among other Nations; Hence Theodorus Gaza
Thessaloniensis, (ad Alphonsum Regem Praefat: in Orationes de Incomprehensibili
Dei Natura, D. Johannis Chrysostomi, quas^e Graeco in Latinum vertit: Operum
Tom. 5. Parisiis, 1588. p. 360.) asserts, Eundem Regem et Pontificem olim
fuisse accepimus, tanquam Regis officio is fungi non posse, qui minus jura et
rations rerum sacrarum teneret, quas nosse Pontifices certe interest. Which he
proves to be the practice among the Grecians, Athenians, Romans, Egyptians,
Jews, (out of Josephus contra Ap^ouem:) and likewise adds, Atque etiam Persos,
Medos, Indos, gentes nominis magni, suos Reges vel ex Sacerdotium ordine
facere, vel maxima familiaritate Sacerdotibus devinctos habere solitos legimus:
And he thereupon concludes, that though of later times the offices of Kings and
Priests are distinguished, for the better discharge of both, being
over-burdensom for one person to manage; and thereupon Quod etsi Rex minus
divinam rem facit, minusque Iudex constitutus est rerum sacrarum, quas Ecclesia
suo vocabulo spirituales appellar, Rations tamen nosse earum rerum, et
quemadmodum singula Christianae religionis debeant, minime ignorare,
proculdubio pulchrum est, et Majestati Regiae consentaneum; since Kings
themselves ought to observe them, and to take special care that all their
subjects do the like, (as he there proves at large) quo plus apud eos (as it
did apud te, Alphonsum) Religionis Chatitas, quam civil negotium valet.

14ly. Because Baronius Annal. Anno 553. number. 237. Anno 528. n. 2. Clemens
Romanus Constit. Apostol. l. 2. c. 38.
Popes, with other ambitious Prelates, Priests and Clergymen deny this truth,
together with Emperors and Kings Supremacy in Ecclesiastical affairs, to avoid
mistakes, I shall briefly inform you, 1. Wherein the Supreme Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction belonging to all, especially to Christian Emperors, Kings,
(exercised by them in all ages, as part of their regal Office) consists; and
then 2dly. evidence the truth of my Proposition by the resolutions of Fathers,
Councils, Popes themselves, Popish and Protestant Divines of chiefest note, in
a Chronological manner. For the First, This their Supreme Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction is reducible to these short Heads.

1. See Centur. Magd. 6. c. 7. col. 440. to 452 Cent. 7. c. 7. col. 236, 237,
etc.
By their royal Laws, Edicts, (as well as examples) to maintain, establish,
propagate, encourage, protect the public sincere worship, orthodox faith,
service, honor, glory, religion of the true and only God throughout their
Dominions, according to the holy Scriptures: to encourage, defend, love all the
Ministers and Professors hereof; to preserve peace, unity, concord in all
Churches under them; and prevent, suppress, all Atheism, Heresy, Blasphemy,
Idolatry, false or superstitious Worships, Heresies, Errors, Schisms,
Profanesse, Impiety, repugnant to Gods Word.

2. To preserve inviolable all the Commandments of the first, as well as of
the second Table, and punish all violations of them by Bishops, Priests or
Deacons, as well as others of their subjects.

3ly. Though not to intrude, like Vzziah, on the Priests, Ministers, Bishops
office, in administering the Sacraments, or constant public Preaching the
Gospel; yet strictly to command all Bishops, Clergymen of what degree soever,
within their Realms, diligently, faithfully, constantly to discharge their
Pastoral duties, by frequent preaching, Catechizing, Administering the
Sacraments, and living answerably to their professions; And to enjoin all other
their Subjects to frequent Gods public Ordinances, embrace the true Religion,
lives as becomes the Gospel; and to punish all their negligences,
extravagances, and scandalous offenses, against their respective trusts, and
Christian profession.

4. To summon General, National, Provincial Councils, Synods, to make, ratify
Ecclesiastical Laws, Canons, and constitute Courts, Commissions, Officers
under them for the examination, suppression of Errors, Heresies, Schisms, and
better Government of the Church and Church affairs, when and where there is
occasion.

5. To erect new Churches, Parishes, Bishoprics, divide or unite old, place
godly Bishops, Pastors in them for Gods public worship; the better
edification, instruction, salvation of the souls of their subjects, and to
provide competent maintenance for them.

6. To receive Complaints, decide Controversies, Differences in Religious or
Ecclesiastical matters by way of final Appeal to them; to restrain, redress all
Encroachments, exactions, usurpations of Popes, Bishops, or other Clergymen,
upon their Ecclesiastical or Civil Jurisdictions, Courts, Rights, or Subjects
Liberties, by Prohibitions or other means; and promote (as much as in them
lies) as well the spiritual and eternal, as temporal felicity of all their
subjects.

This Supreme Jurisdiction of Emperors, Kings, in and over all Ecclesiastical
causes, persons, as well as Secular for their spiritual good; together with
Christians professed acknowledgement of and submission to it, as well under
Pagan as Christian Emperors, Kings, Governors, I shall evidence by these
ensuing Authorities.

Bibliotheca Patrum, Tom. 1. Colon. 1618 p: 8, 9, 10
Aristaeas ad Philocratem fratrem, informs us; That King Ptolomeus Philadelphus
before Christ's Nativity, Anno 10.
demanding of Eleazar and other of the 70. Interpreters, Quonam pacto regnum
incolume in finem usque a Rege conservetur? Et quemadmodum singula just
perficere possit? quomodo recte omnia servans and illaesa, cundem filiis salvum
tradat? etc. Received these answers, Si Dei mansuetudinem Rex in omnibus
imitatur. Si considerat omnem sensum a Deo esse, proponatque ante omniae Dei
timorem. Si non potentiae suae fidat, sed Deum semper imploret, ut just sibi
agendi consilia dirigat. Si Deum assidue imploraverit, ut rectos sibi sensus ad
ea quae in posterum peragenda sunt tribuat, and filiis imperaverit, ne gloria
divitiisque superbiant, sed arbitrentur Dei benignitate sua and sermonis sui
pulchritudinem principium a Deo deducat. And to this question, Quid sit in
gloria Regis potissimum? He received this answer, Deum venerari, non sacris,
neque muneribus, at cum animi puritate ac fide candida ejus voluntutem sequi.
All this they must do not only in their own private persons, as men; but as
Kings and Sovereign Rulers, by inducing, commanding their subjects to imitate
their piety, examples, that they may both arrive at the same ends, temporal and
eternal felicity.

Epistola 10. ad Smyrnenses, Bibl. Patrum, Colon. Agrip. 1618. Tom. 1. p. 88.
Ignatius Bishop of Antioch, Anno Christi, 100.
(St. John's disciple, and contemporary with the Apostles) writes thus. Honorare
oportet et Regem; nec enim Rege quisquam praestantior, nec quisquam similis ei
in rebus omnibus creatis, (therefore not the Pope or Bishops, being creatures)
nec Episcopo qui Deo consecratus est pro totius mundi salute, quicquam majus in
Ecclesia. (The Emperors being then Pagans.) Nec inter Principes quisquam
similis Regi qui in pace and optimis legibus subditos moderatur.

Bibl. Patrum Tom. 1. p. 96 g.
Polycarpus Bishop of Smyrna, Anno 120.
and all the Elders with him, in their Epistle to the Philippians thus exhort
them. Orate pro Regibus, and Potestatibus and Principibus (as supreme
Governors, though then enemies to the cross of Christ) ut fructus vester
manifestus sit in omnibus, and sitis in illo perfecti.

Bibl. Patrum, Tom. 2. p. 43. G. H.
Justin Martyr, Anno 150.
in his Apologia secunda pro Christianis (as well Bishops and Presbyters, as
believers,) ad Antoninum Pium Imperatorem; styles him and the Senate: Ii quae
praesunt, qui non vi, vel tyrannide, sed religione and sapientia ducti ferant
sententiam; of Christians and their Religion: the grounds, principles, and
summary whereof he relates, and refers unto his and the Senates judgments,
consciences; Subjoyning, Tributa vero and census iis qui a vobis constituti
sunt Vbique in primis conamur pendere, Mat. 22.
quemadmodum a Christo instituti sumus, etc. Deum solum adoranus, vobis autem
in aliis rebus laeti servimus, Regesque vos et Principes hominum esse
profitemur, rogamusque ut vos cum Regali potestate sanam bonamque mentem habere
inveniamini. And he concludes his second Apology in defense of the Christians
and their Religion, (which he submits to the Emperors and Senates Judgments)
thus; Haec vobis queque consideranda permittimus, ac si vobis rationi,
vertitatique consentanea videntur, comprobate; sin nugae vobis videntur, ut
verba nugarum plena contemnite, non in eos qui nullam injuriam inferunt, nec
scelus admittunt, ut in hosts mortem statuite. And ends his first Apology with
these words; Qua^ vestrum quoque erit pro Religionis, Philosophiaeque
dignitate, quod jus and aequum est secundum nos (Christianos) judicare.

Ad Autolicum, l. 1. Bibl. Patrum, Tom. 2 p: 158. D.
Theophilus Patriarch of Antioch living about the year 180. Anno 180.
under the Empeperors Marcus Aurelius and Commodus, writes thus of himself (and
all Christians too) in that age, Contra Christianae Religionis calumniatores.
Simulacra and Dii Gentium, opera sunt quae confecit manus humana, and daemonia
impurissima, etc. Quae cum ita sint, magis honorabo Regem sive Caesarem, non
tamen eum adorabo, verum pro eo orabo. Deum qui vere Deus est adorabo, sciens
Caesarem ab ipso esse ordinatum. Dicas ergo, Quare Regem sive Caesarem adorare
recusas? Quia non ad id institutus est ut adoretur, sed ut legitimo, qui ipsi
congruit honoretur honor. Rex enim sive Caesar, Deus non est, sed meminerit se
esse hominem, a Deo in hanc dignitatem promotum, non ut adoretur, sed ut just,
quemadmodum justitia exigit, judicet. Nam Regnum, sive Imperium, rerumque
administratio ipsi a Deo commissa et demandata est. Hinc Caesar, sive Rex,
neminem subjectorum aut Regem aut Caesarem appellari vult. Regium enim sive
Caesareum nomen ipsi soli competit, nec alius id vendicare audet. Ita adorandi
cultus nemini nisi Deo soli deferendus est. Regem quidem sive Caesarem honora:
honora, inquam, magna cum benevolentia, subjectus ei existens, et orans pro eo.
Haec faciens Dei voluntatem exequeris; Nam divinae legis hic tenor est: Prove.
24. 21, 22.
Honora fili mi Deum, and Regem, nec unquam eoram inobediens sis, subito enim
hosts suos ulcisci possunt.

Ireneus Bishop of Lions in France, Anno 180.
resolves and proves from Prove. 8. and Romans 13. Non Diabolus determinavit hujus
mundi Regna, sed Deus: Regis enim cor in manu Dei est: and per Solomonem, ait
verbum, Per me Reges regnant, etc. Ad utilitatem ergo Gentilium positum est a
Deo, sed non a Diabolo, ut timentes regnum humanum, non alterutrum se homines
vice piscium consumant, sed per legum positiones repereutiant multiplicem
Gentilium injustitiam. Et secundum hoc Dei Ministri sunt, qui tributa exigent a
nobis, in hoc ipsum servientes; Quae sunt potestates a Deo ordinatae sunt.
Cuius enim jussu homines nascuntur, hujus jussu et Reges constituuntur, apti
his qui in illo tempore ab ipsis regantur. And elsewhere he writes thus to the
Roman Emperors, Jacobus Langus Notae ad Justin Martyris Oration ad Anton: p. 117.
Know ye, O Emperors, what is committed to you; totus orbis sub manum vestrum
subditus est. Therefore the Pope and all Bishops, Prelates whatsoever, are
under their power.

Bibliotheca Patrum, Tom. 2. p. 129, 139, (...).
Athenagoras a famous Christian Philosopher, Anno 190.
thus begins his Apologia, sive pro Christianis Legatio, dedicated to the Pagan
Roman Emperors Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and Aurelius Commodus; Qui vestrum
Imperium, maximi Reges, long lateque per orbem terrarum agnoverunt, moribus
and legibus inter se diversis degunt, etc. (worshipping their several Gods, and
retaining the religions and ceremonies received from their ancestors without
any restraints or penalties, under them, as he proves at large) Quid multis?
Gentes and Nationes hominum passim iis, quae approbaverunt quaeque, sacris and
mysteriis addictae sunt. Atque haec per vos omnibus licent, haec leges
concedunt; ea nimirum ratione, quod numen omnino tollere, scelus et impietas
videatur; Deorum autem quod sibi quisque delegerit cultus, res necessaria, ut
divinae justitiae metu, a malefactis abstineant mortales. Denique universus hic
terrarum orbis, vestrae prudentiae beneficio altissima pace, (and Deorum suorum
cultu) perfruitur: Nostri tantum qui Christiani vocamur; nulla vobis cura est;
sinitis enim nos, qui nihil mali patramus, imo omnium piissime justissimeque
cum erga Deum, tum Imperium vestrum nos gerimus, exarari, rapi, fugari, etc.
Proinde vos obsecramus, ut nostri aliquam curam suscipiatis, quo aliquando
tandem ab hujusmodi calumniatoribus jugulari desinamus; Then declaring at large
the innocence, purity, allegiance, loyalty and obedience of the Christians, the
truth, purity of the Deity they worshipped, and Christian Religion they
professed; The vanity, impurity of the Images and Idol-gods the Gentiles
worshipped, he concludes thus; Vos vero undequaque in omnibus natura simul and
disciplina boni, moderati, benigni, and imperio digni Principes, mihi (obsecro)
qui crimina nobis objecta dissolvi, et insuper nos esse pios erga Deum, vita et
moribus honestos, animo sobrios et temperantes ostendi, capitibus Regiis
annuite. Ecqui enim consequentur aequius ea quae petunt, quam nos adeo vobis
devoti addictique? Nos enim pro Imperio vestro preces ad Deum fundimus, et ut
filius (quod justissimum est) in regno olim parenti cedat, utque Imperium
vestrum augeatur; denique omnia ex animi sententia eveniant, oramus, quod et
nobis salutare fuerit, ut quietam tranquillamque vitam agentes, vobis interim
ad quaelibet Imperata prompte inserviamus.

Ad Scapulum l. 1 p. 162, 163.
Terullian; Anno 200.
who flourished about 200. years after Christ's Nativity, brings in all the
Christians of his age, in his Apology for them, thus acknowledging the Emperors
Supremacy over them, as well Clergy as ^^ity; and their Loyalty, obedience,
subjection to, and prayers for him. Christianus nullius est hostis, ne dum
Imperatoris, quem sciens a Deo suo constitui, necesse est ut et ipsum diligat,
et revereatur, et honoret, et salvum velit cum toto Romano Imperio, quousque
seculum stabit: tamdiu enim stabit etc. Colimus ergo et Imperatorem sic quomodo
et nobis licet, et ipsi expedit, ut hominem a Deo secundum, et quicquid est a
Deo consecutum solo Deo minorem. Sic enim omnibus major est dum Deo vero minor
est. Sic et ipsis Diis major est, dum et ipsi in potestate sunt ejus. Itaque et
sacrificamus pro salute Imp. sed Deo nostro et ipsius, sed quomodo precepit
Deus, pura prece; Ita nos oramus magis prosalute Imperatoris, ab eo eam
postulantes qui praestare potest. Which he thus seconds in his most Elegant
Cap. 30, 31.
Apologetic. adversus Gentes; who amongst other slanders, charged them with
high Treason against the Emperor, and as public Enemies to him; whereunto he
returned this answer. Ventum est ad secundum titulum laesae Augustioris
Majestatis, etc. Propterea igitur publici hosts Christiani, quia Imperatoribus
neque vanos neque mentientes, neque temerarios honores dicant; quia verae
Religionis homines sollemnia eorum conscientiae potius quam lasciviae
celebrant, etc. Insuper eos debellatis qui salutem Imperatorum sciunt petere,
qui etiam possint impetrare dum sciunt petere. Nos enim pro salute Imperatorum
Deum invocamus aeternum, Deum verum, et Deum vivum, quem et ipsi Imperatores
propitium sibi praeter caeteros malunt. Sciunt quis illis dederit imperium,
sciunt quis homines, quis et ammas. Sentiunt Deum esse solum, in cujus solius
potestate sunt, a quo sunt secundi, post quem primi, ante omnes et super omnes
Deos, homines, etc. Inde est Imperator, unde et homo antequam Imperator: inde
potestas ei, unde et Spiritus. Illuc suspicientes Christiani manibus expansis,
quia innocuis, capite nudo, quia non erubescimus, Denique sine monitore, quia
de pectore oramus, precantes sumus semper pro omnibus Imperatoribus, vitam
illis prolixam, imperium securum, domum tutam, Exercitus fortes, Senatum
fidelem, populum probum, orbem quietum, quaecunque hominis et Caesaris vota
sunt. Haec ab alio orare non possum, quam a quo sciam me consecuturum, quoniam
and ipse est qui solus praestat, etc. Sic itaque nos ad Deum expansos, ungulae
fodiant, cruces suspendant, ignes lambant, gladii guttura detruncent, bestiae
insiliant; paratus est ad omne supplicium ipse habitus orantis Christiani. Hoc
agite, boni Praesules, extorquete animam Deo supplicantem pro Imperatore. Hoc
erit crimen ubi veritas and Dei devotio est. He answers this cavil.
Adeo lati nunc sumus Imperatori, and mentiti vota quae diximus ad evadendum
scilicet. Plane proficit ista fallacia. Admittitis enim nos probare quodcunque
defendimus. Qui ergo putas, nihil nos de salute Caesarum curare, Inspice Dei
voces, literas nostras quas neque ipsi supprimi omnes and plerique casus ad
extraneos transferent. Scitote ex illis praeceptum esse nobis, ad redundantiam
benignitatis, Matthew. 5. 44, 45. Lu. 6. 27, 28.
etiam pro inimicis Deum orare, and persecutoribus nostris been precari. Qui
magis inimici and persecutores Christianorum quam de quorum Maiestate
convenimus in crimen? Sed etiam nominatim and manifest 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2
Orate, inquit, pro Regibus, and pro Principibus and Potestatibus, ut omnia
tranquilla sint. Vobiscum enim concutitur imperium, concussis etiam caeteris
membris ejus, utique and nos (licet extranei a turbis aestimemur) in aliquo
loco invenimur. Est et alia major necessitas nobis orandi pro Imperatoribus,
etiam pro omni statu imperii rebusque Romany, quod vim maxtimam Vniverso Orbi
imminentem, ipsamque Clausuram seculi acerbitates horrendas comminantem, Romani
Imperii commeatu scimus retardari. Itaque nolumus experiri, et dum precamur
differri. Romanae diuturnitati favemus. Sed quid ego amplius de Religione et
pietate Christiana in Imperatorem? quem necesse est suspiciamus, ut eum quem
Dominus noster e^egerit, ut merito dixerim, noster est magis Caesar, ut a
nostro Deo constitutus. Itaque ut plus meo, plus ego illi operor in salutem,
etc. Idem sumus Imperatoribus, qui et vicinis nostris. Male enim velle, male
facere, male dicere, male cogitare de quoquam exaequo vetamur; quodcunque non
licet in Imperatorem, id nec in quempiam; quod in neminem, forsitan magis nec
in ipsum, qui per Deum tantus est. And Adversus Marcionem, l. 1. (who
maintained two distinct Gods, and Principles of equal power) He thus
determines, Summum magnum par non habere. Par autem non habere uni competit, in
duobus esse nullo modo possit. Rer enimetsi summum magnum est in suo solio
usque ad Deum; tamen infra Deum; comparatus autem ad Deum, excidit jam de summo
magno translato in Deum. Nec inter Reges plurifarium videre potest summum
magnum, sed unicum and singular, apud eum scilicet qui Rex Regum, ob
summitatem magnitudinis, and subjectionem caeterorum graduum quasi culmen
dominationis excipitur. It being an impossibility and contradiction (as he
there proves at large) to have two Supreme heads in one kingdom, or any equal
to the King, who is only inferior to God, the King of Kings when compared with
him.

years after Christ, thus answers Celsus his objection against the Christians;
Postremo hortetur nos Celsus, ut opem feramus Imperatori totis viribus, and
geramus ejus auspiciis justa praque bella, neque detractemus militiam si res
ita postulat. Respondemus: feremus Imperatori auxilia suo tempore, sed divina,
ut ita loquar, nimirum armatura fretos non humana. Idque facimus Apostoli
monitis obedientes, cujus haec verba sunt: Obsecro vos primum ut faciatis
deprecationes, orationes, interpellationes, gratiarum actiones, pro omnibus
hominibus, pro Regibus and omnibus in potestate collocatis. Et quo cujusque est
pietas major, eo majorem opem Imperatori fert, magis quam stantes in procinctu
milites et occidentes quotquot possunt ex hostibus. Possumus etiam sic
respondere alienisa nostra fide, and ad militiam pro Republica caedesque
hominum nos urgentibus. Ecce vestrum quoque numinum Sacerdotes and delubrorum
custodes dextras servant puras a sanguine, causa sacrorum, ut incruentis, in
pollutisque caede manibus victimas offerant solenniter iis quos habetis pro
Diis, nec ullo bello dolectos habetis e^ sacrificorum ordine. Hujus moris si
vobis constat ratio, quanto magis caeteris militantibus, non contemnenda est
nostrorum hominum militia, manus quidem puras servantium, decertantium autem
fusis ad Deum precibus pro legitimo Imperatore, et pium justumque bellum
gerente milite, ut destruatur quicquid est just facientibus adversarium?
Itaque precibus nostris profligantes omnes bellorum excitatores Daemones ac
perturbatores pacis ac faederum, plus conferimus Regibus quam qui arma gestant
pro Republica. Laboramus autem pro imperio Romano, dum inste viventes, vota pro
eo facimus, exercentes jus in contemnendis voluptatibus, nec sinentes nos ab
eis quovis pertrahi; sic nos praealiis pugnamus pro Imperatore, et licet cum
ipso non militemus, habemus tamen Castra propria pietatis auspiciis, and rem
deprecationibus gerimus. Et plus beneficiorum a Christianis confertur in
Patriam quam a reliquis hominibus, dum Cives erudiunt ad pietatem erga Deum,
tutelarem Patriae praesidem, ejusque viam ad coelestem quandam Civitatem Dei
muniant, mo^o recte vivant vel in exiguis Civitatibus. Which holy life he
concludes to be the chief end of Governors and Governments, as well as of
private Christians. And in Epist. ad Romanos, c. 13. l. 9. He asserts, that God
will have all crimes whatsoever temporally punished, Non per Antistites, and
Principes Ecclesiae, sed per mundi Judices; to whom he has delegated the
sword, as the higher powers ordained by him, to which every soul must submit:
Therefore Popes and Prelates, as well as others.

Coelius Lactantius, treating of the end of the world, and man's creation
resolves: Quid before argumentum proferri potest, et mundum hominis, et
hominem sua causa Deum fecisse, quam quod ex omnibus animantibus solus ita
formatus est, ut oculi ejus ad coelum directi, facies ad Deum spectans, vultus
cum suo parente communis sit, quasi porrecta manu allevatum ex humo, ad
contemplationem sui excitasse? Propterea igitur coli se Deus expetit, and
honorari ab homine tanquam Pater, ut virtutem et sapientiam teneat, quae sola
immortalitatem parit. Idcirco mundus factus est, ut nascamur; ideo nascimur, ut
agnoscamus factorem mundi ac nostri Deum; ideo agnoscimus, ut colamus; ideo
colimus, ut immortalitatem pro mercede capiamus, quoniam maximis laboribus
cultus constat: ideo praemio immortalitatis afficimur, ut similes Angelis
effecti, summo Patri ac Domino in perpetuum serviamus, et simus aternum Deo
Regnum. Haec summa rerum est, hoc arcanum Dei, hoc mysterium mundi: Yea this is
the sum, mystery, of all the Kings and kingdoms in the world, instituted by
God for these only ends, that all the Rev. 10. 55.
kingdoms of the world might thereby become the temporal kingdoms of God, and
of his Christ, on earth, and his eternal kingdom in heaven.

All these recited Fathers lived under Heathen, not Christian Emperors, Kings,
to whom they Addressed their Apologies, Appeals, Defenses of the substance,
truth of the Christian Religion they professed under them; as the highest
powers on earth, the properest Judges of Religion, and bound in duty to protest
both it and them in the true profession thereof.

When the Roman Emperors, and other Kings became Professors, Protectors, and
Propagators of Christianity, the Fathers, Councils, Bishops, Clergy and
Christians under them, thus set forth their Supremacy in and over all
Ecclesiastical and Religious affairs, persons, as well as temporal.

To pretermit the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction attributed to, and exercised by
Constantine the Great, Anno 340.
the first Christian Emperor, which I shall insist on in the First Chapter of
the 2d. Book; Apologia ad Constantium Imperatorem.
Athanasius Bishop of Alexandria, as he constantly prayed to God in public for
Constantius the Emperor, though an Arrian, with all expressions of Loyalty,
duty, and dedicated a special Apology to him, in Justification both of his
faith and loyalty; uses this expression therein; If I were accused to others,
I would appeal to your Majesty as Paul did to Caesar; but seeing they accuse me
unto you, ad quem a te appellare potero nisi ad Deum? There being none
paramount the Emperor to Appeal to, (neither Pope, nor Council) but God alone.
How this Emperor Constantius, twice removed and banished Athanasius Bishop of
Alexandria, and Paulus Bishop of Constantinople from their Bishoprics, and
placed Gregory and George (two Arrian Bishops) in their Sees; and how upon
their Complaints and Appeals to his Brother the Emperor Constans, reigning in
the West, who summoned their accusers to appear before him, (which they did)
they were restored to their Bishoprics by the advice and decree of the Council
of Sardis (Anno 350) summoned by both these Emperors Edicts, at the requests of
Athanasius and Paulus, to hear and decide their cause, referred to them by the
Emperors: and the special Letters of Constantius sent to Athanasius: What
Creeds, or forms of Christian faith both the Arrian and Orthodox Bishops
compiled in the Councils of Antioch, Sardis, Jerusalem, Smyrna, Millain,
Arimino, and Seleucia, (all summoned by the Emperors Edicts presented to the
Emperors for their approbations and ratifications, as Supreme Judges,
Moderators in such cases, are at large recorded in Socrates Scholasticus

c. 20. to 44. Sozomen Eccles. hist. l. 2. Cent. Magd. 4. cap. 8. and sundry
others, to whom I referr the Readers for brevity sake. Only I shall recite the
memorable requests of the Orthodox Bishops in the Council of Arimino to the
Emperor Constantius in their second Epistle to him, Wherefore we humbly request
your Majesty of your gracious Favor, and wonted Clemency to accept this our
Message; Socrates Sco^^st: Ecclesiast: Hist: l. 2. c: 36 in the Greek, but 22
in Meredith Ha^me^ his English Translation
That you admit no novelty to creep into the Church of God, to the contumely of
such as are already departed this life; but that you grant us your license and
lawful favor, firmly to persevere in those things which our Ancestors have
decreed, in as much as it is evident to all men, that whatsoever they did, it
was through well advised counsel, prudent consideration, and the aid of the
holy Ghost. Also, We humbly request, that the exiled Bishops which wander in
far and foraign Regions, grievously afflicted by reason of great years, and
the misery of want and necessity, may by your safe conduct return home from
exile, to the end the Churches remain not desolate, and desolate of their
Bishops being thus far asunder. Last of all, Our humble suit is to your
Majesty, that nothing may be diminished from, or added to the Old and Ancient
Decrees, but that all whatsoever have been observed unto this day, through the
godly procurement of your Father, may henceforth be of force, strength and
virtue, and that hereafter there may arise no molestation to us about those
things, and that you suffer us not to be banished our Churches, etc.

Ad Constantium. lib. 2.
Saint Hillary Bishop of Poictiers wrote thus to this Arrian Emperor
Constantius, Anno 356.
not long after At hanasius, in the Orthodox Christians behalf. We beseech your
Clemency to permit, that the people may have such teachers as they like, such
as they think well of, such as they choose, and let them solemnize the divine
mysteries, and make prayers for your safety and prosperity. In which Book to
this Emperor, he acknowledges his Supremacy in and over all Ecclesiastical
persons, causes, though he justly censures his force imposed on them in their
Councils, to make them vote against their wills, and the Orthodox faith, in
behalf of the Arrian Heretics.

The Godly Western Bishops assembled by this Arrian Emperor Constantius his
Edict to the Council of Ariminum, Anno 359.
and there long detained by him from their Cures, wrote two Socrates Scholast.

supplicatory Epistles to him from thence to dismiss them to their
Bishoprics, before the cold Winter approached. In the first they thus
petitioned them, We beseech your Majesty that you cause us not to be banished,
nor stayed from our Churches, but that the Bishops, together with the people,
may live in peace and tranquillity, and may humbly pray for your health,
kingdom and safety, in which the Divine Majesty long preserve you; Pro tua
salute, Imperio prolixo. So Nicephorus renders it, but others thus.
Supplicantes Deo pro pace tui Imperii pariter et salutis, quam tibi Dominus in
perpetuum largiatur. They concluded their second Letter to him with this
Supplication; For this cause we beseech your Clemency the second time, most
religious Lord and Emperor, that you command us to depart to our Churches, if
it so please your Godliness, before the sharpness of Winter come. That we may
make our accustomed prayers together with the people to the Almighty God, and
our Lord and Savior Christ for your Empire (or Reign) as we have always
accustomed in times past, and yet cease not to do, and now wish to continue:
Not daring to depart from this Council without his License.

Gregory Nazianzen. Anno 370.
Oration 17. informs the Prince and Governor, Cum Christo Imperium geris, cum
Christo munus hoc administras, Ab illo gladium accepisti, non tam ut eo utaris
quam ut mineris, ut teneas. Quare tibi videndum est ut illi tanquam donarium
quoddam purum and integrum ei qui dedit, serves. Imago Dei es; verum imaginem
quoque Dei Regis, quae quidem hic certa dispensatione gubernaretur, ad aliam
autem vitam migrat, ad quam omnes quoque concedemus. Moneat te exemplar tuum;
ad Deum te rejunge, non ad mundum, ad benignum Dominum, non ad acerbum
tyrannum. Oration 27. He thus describes the Supremacy, office of Kings. Orbis
universus manui vestrae subjectus est, diademate parvo, atque exiguo panno
retentus. Supera solius Dei sunt, infera autem, Vestra etiam sunt. Subditis
vestris Deos vos praebete; Prove. 21. 1.
liceat enim audacius aliquid dicere; Cor Regis in manu Dei est, ut ex
Scripturis audimus and credimus. Hic imperium vestrum sit, non autem in auro et
exercitibus. Aulici proceres fidem Imperatoribus servate, sed prius Deo,
propter quem his etiam quibus commissi and traditi estis. And Oration 46. to
Nectarius Bishop of Constantinople, he exhorts him to stir up the Emperor to
suppress the Apollinarian heretics, concluding thus; ut potentissimum
Imperatorem doceat, nihil et reliquo ipsius erga Ecclesias studio rediturum
esse utilitatis, si tale malum ad fidei sanae eversionem per eorum libertatem,
licentiamque praevaleat.

St. Basil the Great, Bishop of Caesarea, Homil. in Psalm. 32. Non servatur Rex
per multam virtutem; Anno
descants thus: Non exercitus militaris quantavis munitio, non civitatum
moenia, 370.
Operum Graeco ^at. Paris^iis, 1638. Tom. 1. p. 180, 181.
non peditum phalanx, non equestris turma, non navalis muniminis praeparatio
Regi salutem parit. Dominus enim Reges constituit, et destituit, sive
transfert, and nulla est potestas, nisi a Deo constituta. Servatur ergo Rex non
per multam virtutem, sed per Dei gratiam. Therefore it should be his principal
care to serve, please, obey, honor God, promote his glory; and make his
kingdom, Regnum supra omnes Principa^um, peccato minime obnoxium, as he there
defines a kingdom.

And justifies his authority to suppress and punish the Donatists with death
it self, for their heresy, schism and sedition.

St. Ambrose resolves, Anno 370. Apologia Davidis, l. 1. c. 4. 10.
That Kings are exempted from human punishment, Tuti Imperii potestate, as
having no Superiors to punish them. And in his Oration, De Exitu, Vita and
Virtutibus Theodosii Imperatoris, he gives him this applause. Quis splendidius
Pascha celebravit, quam qui sacrilegos removit errores, clausit templa
simulacra destruxit? In hoc Josias Rex superioribus antelatus est. Manet ergo
in lumine Theodosius, and sanctorum coetibus gloriatur. Constantinus quod
primus Imperatorum credidit, and post se haereditatem fidei Principibus
dereliquit, magni meriti locum reperit, cujus temporibus completum est illud
Propheticum, In illo die erit quod supra frenum est, Zech. 14.
sanctum Domino omnipotenti, etc. Then turning his Speech to the Emperor
Honorius, he adds, Denique ideo te Imperatorem pater fecit, Dominus
confirmavit, ut non solum militares Patri, sed omnibus imperares; stiling him,
Totius orbis Imperatorem. In his 29. Epistle to Theodosius, he has this
passage of his suppressing the Valentinian Heretics. Quis habet Valentinorum
haeresin vindicare? quam pietas tua quomodo vindicat, cum eos excludi jusserit,
nec conveniendi usurpare copiam? Si Joslam tibi objiciam, regem Deo probatum,
hoc in illis damnabis quod in illo probatum est. And in his 30. Epistle to the
Emperor Valentinian, beseeching him not to suffer the destroyed Altars of the
Gentiles (upon their Petition to him) to be repaired by his decree. He
resolves, Cum omnes homines qui sub ditione Romana sunt militent Imperatoribus
timorem atque Principibus, tam ipsi vos Omnipotenti Deo et sacrae fidei
militatis, aliter enim salus tuta esse non poterit, nisi unusquisque Deum unum,
hoc est Deum Christianorum, a quo cunctareguntur veraciter colat. Psalm. 115. 4.
Ipse enim solus verus est Deus; Dii autem Gentium daemonia. Huic igitur Deo
vero quisque militat, and qui intimo colendum recipit affectu, non
dissimulationem, non irreverentiam, sed fidei studium, et devotionis impendit.
Postremo, si non ista consensum saltem aliquem non debet colendis Idolis and
prophanis Caeremoniarum cultibus exhibere. Haec si jam sublata non essent,
auferenda suo imperio comprobarem. At cum per totum fere orbem a pluribus retro
Principibus inhibita interdictaque sint; Romae autem a fratre clementiae tuae
augustae memoriae Gratiano fidei vera ratione sublata sunt, et datis antiquata
rescriptis, ne quaeso vel fideliter statuta convelles, vel fraterna praecepta
rescindas. De negotiis omnibus quod statutum, nemo putat esse temerandum, and
praeceptum de religione calcatur? He likewise presses the necessity of all
Christian Bishops, Churches, Peoples public prayers for Kings, and chief
Temporal Magistrates, as well Pagans as Christians; then generally used in all
Churches. And although he has two or three Passages seeming to oppose the
Emperors Supreme Jurisdiction in causes Ecclesiastical; in the case between
Auxentius the Arrian Bishop, and himself, at whose request the Emperor willed
the case in difference might be heard in an Ecclesiastical Assembly, and that
the Emperor himself might be Judge, whether St. Ambrose ought to yield up his

Impietatis assertores and adulteres veritatis, datis apicibus Clementiae
vestrae ad judicia competentia, ab Ecclesiae arcendos esse limitibus, ut in
damnatorum locum per nostrae parvitatis Legatos sancti subrogentur Sacerdotes,
etc. Petimus igitur ut Legatos concilii sanctos viros, aeque clementia vestra
audire digentur, and cum effectu eorum quae poscimus maturius redire
praeciptat, ut mercedem accipiatis a Domino Deo Christo, cujus Ecclesias ab
omni sacrilegorum labe purgastis: Photinianos quoque, quos et superiori lege
censuistis nullos facere debere conventus, et ea quae de concilio Sacerdotum
data est congregando, removistis, petimus, ut quoniam in Sirmiensi oppido adhuc
conventus tentare cognovimus, Clementia vestra interdicta etiam nunc coitione
reverentiam primum Ecclesiae Catholicae, deinde etiam legibus vestris defer
jubeatis, ut vos, Deo praestante, triumphetis, qui paci Ecclesiarum quietique
consulatis.

S. Chrysostom writes of the Emperor, Anno 400
that he is, Hom. 8. ad Popul. Antioch.
Summitas et Caput omnium hominum super terram (Therefore of the Pope and
Bishops.) Parem non habet ullum super terram: Hom. 6. in 1 Timothy 2. and Hom. 33.
in 1 Epist. ad Co^int. c. 13
That the Church powered out prayers morning and evening to God for Kings and
Emperers by Gods command, 1 Timothy 2. In his Lyturgy he has special Collects Pro
Augustissimis et Deo-deditis Regibus nostris. And he gives us this account of
the duty of a King, Tom. 5. col. 1145, 1157, 1140.
Nam is demum vere Rex est, qui iram, qui invidiam, qui voluptatem cohibens
omnia sub Dei Lege agit, mentem liberam servans, neque patiens voluptatum
dominationem animo suo imperitare. Talem equidem Regem libens viderem, et
populis, et terrae, et mari, et Civitatibus, et exercitibus jura dantem.
Quisquis enim animi affectibus rationem Magistram praefecerit, is parvo admodum
negotio ex hominibus, una cum divinis legibus praefeci possit, ut eundem patris
loco subditi habeant, cum omni mansuetudine Civitatibus consuetudinis suae
copiam facientem. Qui vero hominibus imperare quum videatur, irae tamen
avaritiae, voluptibus servit, hic primum subditis suis ridiculus videri possit,
hoc ipso quod Coronam quidem gestat gemmis auroque intertextam, temperantiae
vero corona minime insignis est, and purpureo quidem paludamento toto corpore
fulget, animum autem inornatum habet.

Synesius, Anno 410
in his Book De Regno, dedicated to Arcadius the Emperor, Resolves; Religio
autem et pietas firma imperatoris et regis hasis subjiciatur, De Regno ad
Arcadium, Imperatorem, p. 8, 9, 19, 20.
in qua stabile atque inconcussum simulacrum perstet, nec unquam basi firmiter
insidens ulla vis tempestatis excutiat. Illa vero una et ascendet, et pluribus
in locis apparebit, potissimumque in vertice residebit. Inde sermonem exorsus,
primum omnium Regem, duce et principe Deo, ipsum sui ipsius Regem censeo esse
oportere. Rex autem id experatum habet, Deum sibi sufficere. Regia dignitas
Monarchiam amabilem fecit, eamque divinum inter homines bonum Plato appellat.
Idem autem ipse quod divinae sortis est particeps, omni fastu docet
arrogantiaque vacare oportere. Neque enim Deus quasi scena seipsum ostentans,
aut prodigiis monstrosus editis, sed tacita quasi via gradatim intendens, just
humanas res moderatur, iisque omnibus adesse paratus, quae natura sunt ad
participandum idonea Hoc modo Regem sentio commune omnibus bonum, nec
insolentem esse debere.

St. Anno 420.
Contra Epistolam P^rmeniani l. 1. c. 7. and Epistola 16^ Bishop Jewels Defense
of the Apology against Harding, part 6. chapter 9. divis. 1, 2. p. 695, 696, 697.
Augustine Bishop of Hippo records; That the Donatists being condemned by an
Assembly of Bishops in Africa, appealed for relief to the Emperor (Constantine)
who by special Commission appointed Miltiades then Bishop of Rome, and others,
to be Judges of the Controversy: Who being condemned before the Pope and other
Delegates, they appealed again from their sentence to the Emperor; who
thereupon turned them over to be judged by the Bishop of Arle in France with
others. Who passing sentence of condemnation against them likewise; they
thereupon appealed in the last place, to the Emperors own person, complaining
of the partiality of the Bishop of Rome, and of Arle in their former sentences,
at whose hands they could find no Justice; In the end, they were heard and
condemned by the Emperor himself, and then found themselves also grieved with
his definitive Imperial sentence, condemning his judgment as they had done the
former. Hereupon St. Augustine thus replied upon and answered them; An forte de
Religione non est ut dicat Imperator, vel quos miserit Imperator? Cur ergo ad
Imperatorem Legati Vestri venerunt? Iudex eligitur Imperator: Iudicans
contemnitur Imperator. Therefore St. Augustine condemned them (as did the
Emperor and all others) for impudent, perverse Wranglers, who would not submit
to any Judgment or order, crying out against them: Quid amplius vultis
homines? quid vultis amplius? In which passages there are sundry memorable
particulars: 1. That the schismatical Donatists themselves appealed to the
Emperor Constantine against the sentence of an whole Assembly and Council of
African Bishops, as paramount them. 2ly. That the Emperor by his Commission
made Pope Miltiades, not alone, but with other Bishops, joint Commissioners, to
hear and judge this Cause by virtue of his Commission only, (not of his Papal
or their Episcopal Jurisdiction) which they accordingly pursued. 3ly. That they
appealed against the sentence of the Pope himself, and these Bishops as unjust,
to the Emperor, as paramount them. 4ly. That he on the 2d. Appeal delegate^ the
Examination of this Popes and his Colleagues Judgment, to the Bishop of Arie
and others; which they confirmed. 5ly. That thereupon they appealed to the
Temperors own personal and final Judicature, who passed Judgment against them.
6ly. That though they disliked his Judgment, yet they appealed not from it,
there being no Superior Judge in Ecclesiastical causes above the Emperor, but
God himself. 7ly. That both St. Augustine and the Donatists by their appeal,
reputed the Emperor the properest, yea highest Judge in all Ecclesiastical
causes and controversies. (...)
St. Aug. further relates: That Felix Bishop of Aptingita (a Donatist) ad
Constantini iussionem Proconsularibus gestis fuisse purgatum: whereupon, ait
quidam (of the Donatist Heretics,) non debuit Episcopus Proconsulario judicio
purgari; quasi vero ipse hoc comparaverit, ac non Imperator ita quaeri
jusserat, ad cujus Curiam, de qua rationem Deo redditurus esset, res ea maxim
pertinebat. To which St. Augustine: replied, Si criminis non est provocare ad
Imperatorem, non est criminis audiri ab Imperatore: Ergo nec ab illo cui causam
delegaverit Imperator, etc. His resolution therefore was, that the purgation of
a Bishop belonged specially to the Emperors charge, though a mere
Ecclesiastical matter. The same Father informs us, Contra Petillianum Don. l.

Contra Cresconium Grammaticum, l. 3. c. 42, 43, 44 Epist. 48. and 50

That this Emperor made severe Laws against these heretical and schismatical
Donatists, to suppress their errors, schisms, meetings: which being duly
executed, reclaimed many of them from their heresy and schism. Upon which
experience S. Augustine altered his opinion, concerning the unlawfulness of
punishing Heretics with corporal punishments, or death, to reclaim them, In
his Tom: 8. pars 2. p. 819. 637, 638, 852.
Enarratio in Psalm. 134. He resolves, Rex in omni gente prior est; quoniam Rex

Luke 13. 1. Tim. 2. That all Christian whatsoever ought to be subject to Kings,
to pay tribute to, and pray for them, though heathens and persecutors. In his
Enarratio in Psalm. 137. on these words. Confiteantur tibi Domine omnes Reges
terrae; Sed and ipsi cum tibi confitentur cum laudant te, non terrena
desiderent a te. Quid enim Reges terrae desideraturi sunt? Nonne ^am habent
ipsius imperium? Quid amplius potest? Altior sublimitas necessaria est. Sed
fortasse quanto altior, tanto periculosior est. Ideoque reges quanto sunt in
majore felicitate terrena, tanto magis humiliari Deo debent. Vt quid faciant?
Quoniam audierunt omnia verba oris tui, and cantent in viis Domini, quoniam
magna est gloria Domini. Cantent in viis Domini Reges terrae. In quibus Domini
viis cantant? De quibus supradictum est: In misericordia tua and veritate tua,
quoniam universae viae Domini misericordia and veritas. Non ergo sint Reges
terrae superbi, sed humimiles sint. Tunc cantent in viis Domini, si humiles
sint, ament and cantabunt. Canticum novum pertinet ad hominem novum. Ambulent
ergo and Reges terrae in viis tuis, ambulent and cantent in viis tuis. Quid
cantent? Quoniam magna est gloria Domini, non Regum. Vide quomodo Reges voluit
cantare humiliter in viis Domini, non se extollentes adversus Dominum. He
elsewhere resolves how Kings do serve the Lord even in taking care of things
belonging to God and Religion. Contra Cresconium, lib. 3. c. 9.
In hoc Reges Deo serviunt, sicut eis Divinitus praecipitur, in quantum sunt
Reges, si in suo regno bona jubeant, mala prohibeant: non solum quae pertinent
ad humanam societatem, verum etiam quae ad divinam Religionem. Quomodo ergo
Reges Domino serviunt in timore, nisi ea quae contra iussa Domini fiant
religiosa severitate prohibendo atque plectendo? Aliter enim servit quia homo
est, aliter etiam quia Rex est. Ad Bonifacium Tom: 2. 50 Epist: Gratian
Distinctio, 9.
Quia homo est, ei servit vivendo fideliter; quia vero etiam Rex est servit
leges justa praecipientes, et contraria prohibentes, authoritate sanciendo.
Servit Deum ut Ezechias; and templum restaurando, etc. and as King Josiah and
Nebuchadnezzar after his restitution, and Darius did, etc. Quicunque ergo
legibus Imperatorum quae pro Dei veritate feruntur, attemperare non vult,
acquirit grande supplicium. Nam a temporibus Prophetarum omnes Reges qui in
p^pulo Dei non prohibuerunt, nec everterunt, quae contra praecepta Dei fuerunt
instituta, culpantur; and qui prohibuerunt and everterunt, super aliorum merita
laudantur. Quando autem Imperatores pro veritate contra falsitatem constituunt
bonas leges, tenentur servientes, and corrigentur intelligentes, etc. And, De
quaestionibus Novi and Veteris Testamenti, cap. 13. Non nescivit David divinam
esse traditionem in officio ordinis Regalis. (...) Saul in eadem adhuc
traditione positum honorificat, ne Deo injuriam facere videretur, qui his
ordinibus honorem creavit. Dei enim imaginem habet Rex, ut Episcopus Christi:
Whence our English Apostle, In Theatro Militantis Ecclesiae cap. 33. Thomas
Waldensis Doctrinale fidei, Tom 1. lib. 2. Artic. 3. c. 75.
John wickliff, thus argued the Kings superiority above the Popes or Bishops,
Quod Episcopus est Vicarius Christi secundum humanitatem, REX AUTEM EST DEI
VICARIUS: Dignior ergo Vicariatus incumbet Regi quam Episcopo. Christus
ordinavit seculare brachium per potentiam coactivam; esse Divinitatis Vicarium,
dando ei gladium corporalem; and ordinavit Sacerdotium esse humanitatis Christi
Vicarium, patiendo, et ipsum in humilitate et tribulationibus imitando, ut
docet Augustinus in loco multiplici. To which Thomas Waldensis replies, Ecce
jam habis Regem imaginem Deitatis, sed ut per gladium quem accepit. Solum Dei
servis humana ministret. Ecce habes quod Rex si^ Divinitatis imago, non tantum
qualiter omnis homo est imago Dei, a primordialis creationis effectu, sed
speciali etiam praerogativa potestatis acceptae, et Regiae dignitatis intuitu.
Ad quid putas? ad dispensandum humana, ut supra dixit Gregorius. Regnas regno
Christi quae sunt humana dispensare. Sacerdos est imago Christi, et cujus
Christi? Nonne Dei hominis? et quid efficiens? nonne divina dispensans? Pluris
ergo est, ut nulli est dubium, imago Christi Episcopus dispensans divina, quam
Deitatis Vicarius, vel Imago Rex dispensans humana. As if God himself, whose
Image and Vicar a King is, were only and principally employed about human
affairs, not divine: Now if God himself does most of all, in the Mat. 6. 25, to
34, Psalm. 78. 70, 71, 72.
very first place mind, intend, command, promote his own worship, service,
glory, divine things, and the salvation of men's souls; then certainly Kings,
who are his Image, Vicars, must do so too, or else they were neither his Image,
nor Vicars, but most unlike unto him: Wherefore God called David from the
Sheepfold to the Throne for this very end, Ps. 78. 70, 71, 72. 2 Samuel 5. 2. 1 Chronicles. 11. 2. and cap. 29. John 21. 15, 16 17. Acts 20. 28
To feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance; as well as Peter or
Bishops to feed his sheep and flock; who thereupon fed them according to the
integrity of his heart, especially with heavenly instructions, exhortations,
prayers, precepts, Psalms; and guided them by the skilfulnesse of his hands, by
setting up Gods public worship, Ark, Temple, amongst them, as the Here, p. 12,
13.
premises evidence; to which St. Augustine here principally referrs; and so
Waldensis his evasion, conclusion is most absurd, and Wickliffs position
orthodox.

That the Emperors Honorius and Theodosius should be petitioned and requested
by them 1. A Religiosis Imperatoribus postulandum, ut Reliquias Idolorum per
omnem Aphricam jubeant penitus amputari, and templa eorum jubeant omni modo
destrui. 2. A religiosissimis Imperatoribus postulandum, Petendum etiam, ut
statuere dignentur, ut nullum ad testimonium dandum Ecclesiastica cujuslibet
persona pulsatur. 3. Illud etiam petendum, ut quae contra praecepta divina
convivia multis in locis exercentur, quae ab errore Gentilium attracta sunt,
etc. prohibeantur. 4. Necnon et illud petendum, ut spectacula Theatrorum
caeterorumque lu^orum die Dominica, vel caeteris religionis Christianae diebus
celeberrimis amoveantur. 5. Et illud petendum est, ut statuere dignentur, ut si
quis cujuslibet hominis Clericus Iudicio Episcoporum quocunque crimine fuerit
damnatus, non liceat eum sive ab Ecclesiis quibus praefuit, sive a quolibet
homine defensari, interposita poena damni, pecuniae atque honoris, quo nec
aetatem, nec sexum excusandum esse praecipiant. 6. Et de his etiam petendum, ut
si quis ex qualibet iudicra art ad Christianitatis gratiam venire voluit, ac
liber ab illa macula permancre, non eum liceat, a quoquam iterum ad eadem
exercenda reduci, vel cogi, 7. Ab Imperatoribus universis visum est
postulandum, propter afflictionem pauperum, quor^m molestiis sine intermissione
fatigatur Ecclesia, ut defensores eis adversus potentias divitum cum
Episcoporum provisione delegentur. 8. Simul etiam petendum, ut illam legem quae
a religiosae memoriae eorum Patre Theodosio, de auri Libris December in
ordinatores, vel ordinatos Haereticos, seu etiam in possessores; (ubi eorum
congregatio deprehenditur) promulgata est, ita deinceps confirmari praecipiant,
ut in eos valeat, contra quos propter eorum insidi^s Catholici provoca^^
contestatione a deposuerunt. Ut hoc saltem Terore Schismatica vel Haeretica
pravitate desistant, qui Consideratione aeterni supplicii emendari corrigique
dissimulant. 9. Petendum etiam, ut Lex quae Hereticis vel ex Donationibus, vel
ex Testamentis aliquid capiendi vel relinquendi denegat facultatem; ab eorum
quoque pietate hactenus repetatur, ut eis relinquendi vel sumendi jus adjuvat
qui pertinacie furore caecati in Donatistarum errore perseverare voluerint.
Caeterum illis qui consideratione Unitatis et pacis se corrigere voluerint,
absque Interdicto hujus Legis capiendae Hereditatis aditus pateat, si adhuc in
Erroris Haeretico constitutis aliquid ante donationis vel hereditatis obvenit
his sane exceptis qui lite pulsati, putaverunt ad Catholicam transeundum: quia
de talibus credibile est, non metu caelestis Iudicii, potius quam terreni
commodi aviditate, unitatem Catholicam praeoptasse. To obtain all which
Petitions and Laws, this Council dispatched their particular Legates to these
Pious Emperors, with these their joint requests; for most of which they
published particular Laws, recorded in the Codes of Lib. 1. Cod. Tit. 4. etc.
Justinian and Lib. 16. Cod Tit. 1, to 8.

Bishop of Cyprus informs us; Romanum Imperium (everso Macedonico) orbis

Romanum Imperium non periisse cum Salvatoris ortu; siquidem Augusto regnante,

ita dixerim) homines suae ditionis subiunxit, Luc. 2.
omnemque terrarum orbem (ut evangelii testantur) descripsit, tributumque
imperavit. Tom. 2. p. 27.
Regnum igitur Romanorum, quod illo obtinent viguit, usque adhuc permansit.
Therefore the Pope and Romish Prelates were then all subject to, not paramount
the Emperor, as he resolves in his Interpretatio in Epist. ad Romanos, c. 13.
Omnis anima potestatibus sublimioribus subdita sit; Sibi est Sacerdos aliquis,
sive Antistes, sive monasticam vitam professus, iis cedat quibus sunt mandati
Magistratus. Clarum est autem si cum pietat^; non autem si Dei praeceptis
repugnent. Magistratibus parere praecipitur. Potestates enim a Dei providentia
a^pendent. Ipse enim communis ordinis cura^gerens, efficit, ut hi quidem
imperarent, illi vero parerent, veluti quoadam fraenum iis qui se injuste
gerunt, Magistratuum timorem incutiens. Porro autem sciendum est, quod et
Magistratum gerere, eique parere a divina providentia pendere: for the ends
mentioned by the Apostle. And in his Expositio in 1 Timothy 2. and Tit. 3. 1. He
presses praying for Heathen and wicked Kings, Magistrates, that they may
become Christians; and obedience to all their lawful commands by all sorts of
Christians.

St. Cyrill, Anno 430.
the famous Bishop of Alexandria, Operum Tom: 2. Parisiis 1608 p. 673.
begins his Book (ad Theodosium Regem pientissimum, Devota in Dominum nostrum
Jesum Christum fide) thus, A Deo, cujus est summa Celsitudo, Vobis,
Christianissimi Reges, humanae claritudinis fastigium, incomparabilibus
excellentiis prae omnibus aliis exsurgens et exaltatum, eximiaque and excelsa
sors sunt data, dignus nimirum super terram honor. Etenim illi quidem omni genu
flectunt, thronique and Principatus, dominationesque ac potestates servam
submittunt cervicem, and decentibus illum semper colentes glorificationibus,
plenum esse dicunt coelum and terram gloria ejus. Viderit autem quis et in
vestra Serenitate decorum et evidentem tam illustris et omnium summae
Nobilitatis Typum. Vos enim estis (not the Pope) et summorum dignitatum fontes,
et supra omnem eminentiam, humanaeque felicitatis principium et origo. Et
vestrae quidem Majestatis clementissimis nutibus, quicquid Regni soliis
substractum est, ut vitam legitimam et admirabilem agat, gubernatur; at qui
jugum non ferunt, facile a vestro robore victi, cadunt, etc. vel Regis genibus
misericordiam quaerunt. Ea propter vobis mundum subjecit, etc. Tam pii et
praeclari vestri Imperii summum praesidium est Dominus noster Jesus Christus.

Nam, per iilum Reges regnant, and potentes scribunt justitiam. Distribuit

Majestati donatae sunt, and adhuc danda, ut credimus. Quod autem gloriosa in
Deum pietas Regus honoribus immobile sit fundamentum, etiam ex ipsa sancta
divinaque Scriptura dicere attentabo; which there he does: Therefore to advance
Religion, piety, and Gods glory, the unmovable foundation and stability of
kingdoms, is, and ought to be the principal part, care of Kings and their
Kingly office, as he inferrs. Anno 431.


These most great and most religious Emperors, Cyrilli Opera Tom. 2. p. 22.
epistola. 17.
Theodosius and Valentinian in their Epistle to this St. Cyril, wherein they
summoned him to the Council of Ephesus, confirm this truth. A pietate quae in
Deum est, reipublicae nostrae constitutio pendet, et multa utrinque est
cognatio, et societas. Cohaerent enim inter se, et altera alterius crescit
incremento, ita ut vera religio justitiae studio, respublica vero ab utrisque
adjuta, resplendeat. In regnum itaque a Deo constituti, et connexio pietatis ac
prosperitatis subditorum existentes, societatem horum perpetuo indivulsam
custodimus, ac providentia nostra pacem inter homines procurantes, hactenus
quidem reipublicae augendae ministramus: per omnia vero subditis, ut ita
dicamus servientes, ut pie vivant et conversentur, sicut pios decet, adornamus,
utriusque ut convenit, curam gerentes. Neque enim fieri potest ut alteri
students, non similiter ut alterius curam geramus. Nota.
Prae caeteris in hoc incumbimus, ut Ecclesiasticus status, et qui Deum deceat
et nostris temporibus conveniat, firmus permaneat, tranquillitatemque ex omnium
consensu retineat, sitque per Ecclesiasticarum rerum pacem quietus, et pia
religio servetur irreprehensibilis; eorumque vita qui ad clericatum et magnum
Sacerdotium delecti sunt, ab omni sit culpa libera. Cum autem ista
intelligeremus cum per dilectionem erga Deum, tum per animum, veritatis amantem
in iis qui pii sunt, obtinere posse jam quidem saepenumero eorum gratia quae
commodum inciderunt Deo dilecttissimam omnium eorum qui ubique sunt
sanctissimorum Episcoporum Synodum necessariam esse duximus, verum cunctatores
per molestiam pietatis ipsorum improbitatem facti sumus. At urgens jam
necessitatem cum Ecclesiasticarum tum publicarum disceptatio, et sum
profuturam et irrecusabilem illam esse ostendit. Quapropter ne quae tam utilium
rerum quaestionem concernunt, si negligantur in pejus dilabantur, id quod a
temporum nostrorum est pietate alienum, curabit pietas tua ut post imminens
sanctum Pascha volente Deo, circa Pentecostes diem ad Ephesiorum Asiae
Civitatem adveniat; et paucos, et quos probaverit ex Provincia sibi subjecta
sanctissimos Episcopos, ad eandem Civitatem convenire faciat, ut nec qui
sanctissimis Provinciae tuae Ecclesiis sufficiant nec qui concilio sint
accomodi, desint. Sunt, enim Exemplaria a nostra Majestate de praedicta
sanctissima Synodo Dilectis per Vniversas Metropolcis Episcopis, scripta, ut
hoc facto, et perturbatio quae ex controversiis istis, accidit, secundum
Ecclesiasticos Canones dissolvatur, et quae indecenter committuntur
corrigantur, sitque et pietati erga Deum, et publicis rebus commoda firmitudo;
nec aliquid quacunque in re ante Sanctissimam Synadum, et futuram illius
communem sententiam, a quoquam seperatim innovetur. Et persuasi quidem sumus
unumquemque Deo Dilectissimorum Sacerdotum ubi resciverint, cum
Ecclesiasticarum; tum Publicarum rerum gratia hac nostra Sanctione percitum, ad
Sanctissimam Synodum diligenti studio properanter accursurum, and rebus ita
necessariis atque ad beneplacitum Dei pertinentibus pro viribus consulturum.
Nos autem multam harum rerum curam gerentes neminem desiderari leviter
patiemur, nec ullam sive apud Deum, sive apud Nos excusationem habebit, si
quisquam non confestim ad praedictum tempus loco determinato sedulus
comparuerit: Quisquis enim ad Sacerdotalem vocatus Synodum non prompte
accurrit, esse se Conscientia non bona Declarat. Deus te multo tempore
custodiat Pater Sanctissime ac Religiosissime. A most pregnant Testimony, that
Emperors have, and ought to have a principal care of Religion, to preserve its
purity, suppress all Heresy contrary thereunto; to convene Synods when there
is occasion, to enjoin all Bishops to resort to them, and to examine, ratify
their Votes when approved by their Edicts; all which the Epistles written to
these Emperors from the Bishops assembled in this Synod will more fully
demonstrate.

The famous General Council of Ephesus, Anno 432
Surius Council. Tom: 1. p. 655 to 694, and 660, 601, 602, etc.
thus summoned by the most Religious Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian, to
suppress the Heresy of Nestorius, then infesting the Church, writ several
Epistles to them, wherein they render them an account of all their proceedings
therein, clear the scandalous reports raised of them, extol those Emperors
Zeal and Piety for Defense of Religion, desire their Confirmation of their
Votes, Suppression of Heresies, heretics, and power out prayers for, and
Petitions to them. The Titles of their Epistles to them are: Pientissimis,
Religiosissimis, ac Deo dilectissimis Theodosio and Valentiniano Victoribus,
triumphatoribus ac semper Augustis, Sancta Synodus per gratiam Dei, et
Dominationis vestrae nutum, Ephesi congregata. The 1. Epistle to them begins
thus, Surius, ibid. p. 685.
Jam inde a progenitoribus pietas vestra Christi amantes ac pientissimi Reges
rectam est consecuta fidem, et hanc quotidie evehit multumque curarum veritatis
impendit dogmatibus. Quorum gratia cum perturbatio non solum in magna illa
Civitate, sed and in universo terrarum orb per ea dogmata fieret quae a
Nestorio sunt praedicata, de Sanctorum Patrum, sanctorumque Apostolorum and
Evangelistarum traditione, non contempsit vestra Dominatio perturbatas
Ecclesias, et adulterata fidei ac verae pietatis dogmata; sed ex universo orb
pietas vestra Metropolitanos pientissimos, et aliorum quoque quarundam
Civitatum Episcopos congregari jussit, sufficiens ad eam rem temporis
determinato spacio. After which they render them an Account of their
proceedings in the Synod. Among other things they relate, Commentariis actorum,
authoritatis gratia, pientissimos pietatis vestrae literas praemiserunt; post
quas fidei expositionem subiecimus, proposita primum ea quae a sanctis est
^radita Apostolis; deinde et ea quae per sanctos trecentos december et octo Patres
Niceae quondam a beatae memoriae Constantino congregatos, est facta expositio:
cujus fidem dominatio vestra illustriorem reddidit. And concludes it thus;
Oramus autem vestram Dominationem ut universam ipsius (Nestoris) doctrinam et
sanctis Ecclesis tolli, et libres ejus ubicunque inventi fuerint, igni tradi
jubeat, quibus gratiam Dei, qui benevolentiae gratia homo factus est, reprobare
conatur. Quod si quis sancita vestra contempserit, denuncietur illi, timendam
ipsi esse dominationis vestrae indignationem: not their Anathema.

They thus begin their Fourth Epistle: Surius Ibid. p. 688.
Dominatio quidem vestra ad confirmandam pietatem sanctae Synodo diligentiorem
dogmatum examinationem facere praecepit, quam et fecimus, veteri Patrum, imo et
sanctorum Apostolorum et Evangelistarum, et trecentorum december et octo qui
Niceae congregati fuerunt, traditioni obtemperantes, quam et concorditer
interpretati sumus, et animo uno vestrae pietati manifestam in Commentariis
actorum exhibuimus, et in quibus et Nestorium diversa sentire depraehensum
deposuimus. After which they inform the Emperors of Candidianus his favoring
Nestorius, Ibid. p. 689.
and indirect proceedings in the Council (of which the Emperors made him
President) desiring the Emperors to send for him, and what Bishops they
pleased, qui res gestas coram vestra sancta pietate, tueantur. In the beginning
of their 5. Epistle, they write: Ibid. p. 689, 690.
Quae sanctae sunt Synodo a dominatione vestra mandata, ad competentem deducta
sunt effectum, id quod pietati vestrae notum fecimus: Relating the particulars
at large, they conclude and pray, Quae a sancta aecumenica Synodo ad pietatis
subsidium contra Nestorium, et impium illus scripta sunt dogma, suum habere
robur, per pietatis vestrae nutum et assensum confirmata. Their 6. Epistle to
them thus begins. Ibid. p. 691.
Deus ille omnium Christi amantes Imperatores, qui curam vestram ac diligentiam
quam pietati impenditis gratam ac acceptam habet, etiam Episcoporum qui per
occidentem sunt animos zelo, ad vindicandum Christum, contumelia affectum
excitavit, etc. And thus concludes, Quoniam itaque causa haec finem consecuta
est, cum Dominationi vestrae optatum, tum Ecclesiis omnibus securissimum, and
qui fidei suam adferat similitudinem, Pietatem vestram oramus, ut jam nos,
alios paupertate obrutos, alios morbis detentos, alios seniogravatos, et
peregrinationem hanc amplius far non valentes, ita ut et aliqui ex nobis
Episcopi et Clerici jam sint mortui, ab hac cura, et perigrinatione liberet, ut
ista sedata sollicitudine, magnae Civitatis Ecclesiae curam geramus.
Supplicamus etiam ut ad eos, qui singulis sint locis, literas comminatorias
mittat, ne denuo alia suscitetur Ecclesiis molessia, ac perturbatio
sanctissimis Episcopis in ipsorum regionibus oriatur. Etenim facta jam pietatis
declaratione and Vniverso Orb consonum de illa sententiam ferente, paucis
demptis, Nestorii amicitiam pietate praeferentibus gratiam hanc haud immeritam,
petimus, dominationi vestrae supplicantes, ut nos cura ista deinceps liberet,
ut ordinationi futuri Episcopi incumbamus, et in fide jam et Pietate confirmata
nos Oblectemus, purasque ac synceras pro dominatione vestra Preces omnium
Domino Christo destinemus.

Their 8. Epistle to them is thus prefaced. Ibid. p. 6^3.
Regia quidem vestra et Christi amans Majestas, Pientissimi Reges, a pueris
Zelum circa fidem et Canones declaravit, cujus etiam gratia, Orbis Episcopos ad
Ephesiorum Civitatem concurrere pia Sanctione praecepit, verum literae
Serenitatis vestrae jam nobis per magnificentissimum et Gloriosissimum Comitem
Johannem sectae, haud modicam attulere perturbationem, innuentes imposturam
quandam et mendacium pro veracibus quosdam vestris auribus objecisse, etc. And
thus they conclude it; Sublimitati vestrae supplicamus, ut a sancta Synodo,
quos dominatio vestra probaverit vocentur, ut coram regia vestra, et Christi
amans Majestas de omnibus certius instruatur. Their 9. Epistle has this
Exordium, and Progress: Ibid. p. 663
Non est quidem Dominatio vestra passa rectam fidem quasi cuniculis quibusdam
suffodi per Nestorii doctrinam, etc. Ob hanc causam, Vniversi ad pietatis
vestrae dominationem confugimus supplicantes, ut quae contra Nestorium et illi
consentientes sunt gesta, robut suum habeant; quae vero ab illis, qui Nestorium
vindicant, eo quod cum illo sentiunt, contra Synodi nostrae Duces illegitime
facta sunt, inefficacia et irrita maneant, ut neque convenienter, neque
canonice, sed contra eos qui de nullo sunt delicto convicti, sola ulciscendi
libidine ab illis sunt gesta, qui contra sanctam Synodum cum Nestorio sentiunt.
All depending upon their Imperial Edicts, Orders, Ratifications.

Ibid. 690.
St. Cyril and Memnon begin their Book against Nestorius presented to this
Council, in this manner. Divum Imperatorum decretum, et nos et vestram
Sanctitatem in Ephesiorum Metropoli convenire jussit, ut et rectam Apostolicae
fidei determinationem communi sententia confirmemus, et haeresim a Nestoro
recens inductam probemus.

These Emperors commanded all the Bishops summoned to appear in this Council,
not to depart thence til all things were concluded: And because the Bishops
there assembled were incensed against each other, each of them endeavoring to
maintain his opinion, party by indirect means, the Emperors declared all things
thus obtained to be nulled, and sent his Secretary of State, and some of his
own Palace, together with the most famous Earl Candidianus, to this Council to
preside therein, and see they acted nothing but what they by their Letters
enjoined them, and not to depart thence: as this clause in the Emperors Letters
to the Council evidenceth. Surius Ibid. p 687, 694.
Et obeam causam quisquam e nostro palatio, una cum preclarissimo Comite
Candidiano missus fuerit, qui quaegesta sunt, secundum nostram jussionem
cognoscat, et quae sunt inconvenientia prohibeat, neque abscedat quisquam
congregatorum Episcoporum ab Ephesiorum Civitate, neque ad Majestatis nostrae
veniat exercitum, nec in Patriam suam revertatur, ita ut ista nemini, quacunque
spe ducto, transgredi liceat. Sufficiant quidem istae literae ad denunciandum
vestrae pietati, ne quid aliud praeter nostram jussionem iis quae facta sunt
adjiciatis. Sciat tamen Sanctitas vestra, etiam illustrissimis provinciarum
primoribus esse scriptum, ut neminem prorsus sine nostra jussione in patriam ac
civitatem suam reversum recipi sinant. Oportet enim, ut omnia primum jurta id
quod Deo placiturum est, sine contentione et cum veritate examinata, tum demum
a nostra pietate corroborentur; neque enim Majestas nostra hominum jam
aliquorum, neque sanctissimi ac pientissimi Nestorii, neque cujusquam alterius,
sed ipsius Doctrinae ac veritatis Nota.
curam gerit.

Finally, these Emperors made their chief Secretary of State, and privy
Counselor Register in this Synod; in their Epistles to the Bishops in this
Council, express their great care of Religion; and toward the cloze thereof,
sent the most glorious John, Count of Sacred Things, to know what they had done
concerning the Faith, that they might do what he should deem profitable for
that end.

Ibid. p. 691, 692.
Celestino, Ruffo, Augustiniano, and reliquis religiosissimis Episcopis:
Quantum zeli circa pietatem, et progenitorum nostrorum fidem ostenderimus,
multis quidem (ut arbitramur) praecedentibus Judiciis.
Judiciis perspicue declaratum est: non minus autem illud et in eo, quod
Synodum vestram nuper convocavimus, Vniverso Orbi manifestatum esse credimus,
etc. Sciat etiam Sanctitas vestra, quod praeclarissimum et Gloriosissimum
Johannem Comitem Sacrorum ob eam causam misimus, ut ubi ille pietatis vestrae
circa fidem scopum cognoverit, quae ipsi videbuntur utilia faciatis.

By all which passages of this famous General Council, the Emperors Supreme
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, Judicature, care of the true Faith and Religion is
most fully and clearly demonstrated beyond contradiction. Pope Coelestine
himself was summoned to it, and excused his absence, but did not substitute See
Dr. James Bastardy of the Fathers, part 2 p. 90, 91.
St. Cyril to supply his place therein, as some Romanists fable.

The Oriental Bishops assembled in this Council favoring Arrius and Nestorius,
by faction opposed Cyril and Memnon, making a Relation of their proceedings
therein to Surius Ibidem p. 618, 619.
Callimot King of Persia, (who commanded the Bishops under him to appear at
this Council) to incense him against them, thus praying his assistance against
their actings. Pietas vestra, quae benefaciendo orbi et Ecclesiis Dei

haec vestrae Majestatis edicta aperte et manifest piam vestram et pacificam

Ecclesiarum (ut videtur) and natus and educatus, assumpto cooperatore Memnonis

obsecramus et oramus, ut vestra Majestas quamprimum religioni quae impugnatur
subsidium ferat, et celerem correctionem imponat illorum insaniae et tyrannidi,
quae quasi turbo ad Haereticam perfidiam audaciores corripit. Iustum enim est,
ut vestra pietas, Persidis et earum quae inter Barbaros sunt, Ecclesiarum Nota.

The Orthodox Bishops on the contrary, writ for the restitution, vindication of
St. Cyril and Memnon to these Emperors; Supplicamus igitur Regiae vestrae
Deoque dicatae Majestati, ut sanctissimos et Deo dilectissimos Episcopos
Cyrillum and Memnonem Sanctae Synodo restituatis, nequaquam a Canonibus
condemnatos, etc. et ut patrocinium orthodoxae fidei, quam hactenus et semper
custodire sategistis. So that both the Orthodox and Heretical Bishops in this
Council acknowledged this Supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction (by all these
passages,) to be in the Emperors and Kings, not them.

Pope Sixtus the 3d. was accused to the Emperor Valentinian, Anno 433
for defiling Chrysogonia, a consecrated Virgin, by one Bassus a Presbyter; who
thereupon commanded a Synod to be summoned to examine the accusation; where
this Pope appearing, cum coram Synodo 56. Presbyterorum, causam dixissset, cum
magna examinatione (in the presence of Valentinian) judicio Synodico purgatus

thereupon appearing accordingly, after a large discourse; Liberius refusing to
renounce his communion and justifying Athanasius his cause, was by the Emperors
sentence, banished to Berea in Thrace, after three days respite given him to
advise, Whether he would subscribe against his communion, and so return to
Rome, or go into exile? In this conference he used these expressions to the
Emperor; Judicia quidem Ecclesiastica, O Imperator, summa cum aequitate fieri
debent. Quapropter si tuae Clementiae ita visum sit, Iudicium haberiiubeto,
etc. Then speaking for the Orthodox Bishops that were deprived; he added.
Quapropter, si placet, iube Episcopos ad proprias seeds restitui: (though
deprived by the Arrian Bishops in three Councils) hereby acknowledging the
Supreme Ecclesiastical Judicature, and power of depriving, restoring Bishops
for matters of Faith, to be in the Emperor. Liberius after two years exile
(upon the Petition of the Roman Matrons to this Emperor) was restored to his
See of Rome, which Felix governed during his absence: but with this direction
in this Emperors Letters, Vtrosque communiter inter se Ecclesiam illam regere.

Ecclesiast. Hist. l. 5 Pro^mio.
Socrates Scholasticus, Anno 440.
his Contemporary, has this passage; thus Englished by Bishop Hanmer his
Translator. We have therefore throughout our History made mention of the
Emperors, because that since they began to embrace the Christian Religion, the
Ecclesiastical affairs seemed much to depend of them; so that the chiefest
Councils were in times past, and are at this day summoned by their consent and
procurement (not the Popes.) And he there further observes, how when the
Commonwealth has been tossed and turmoyled with troublesome dissension and
discord, the Church of God likewise (as infected with the same contagious
disease) has been altogether out of quiet. Nota.
For whosoever with diligent observation will remember the aforesaid times,
without doubt he shall perceive (as our selves have lately done) that when the
Commonwealth was in an hurliburly, the Church in like sort was shaken with the
storms of adversity: for either he shall find, that both at one time, were out
of quiet, or that the ones misery ensued immediately after the others
misfortune: and sometimes when the Church began to vary about Religion, the
Commonwealth immediately followed after with Rebellion; and some other times on
the contrary. Therefore Godly Christian Emperors are the principal means under
God to preserve the peace, and advance the felicity of Church and State, by
having the Supreme Jurisdiction in and over both, and endeavoring the defense,
propagation of the true orthodox faith, and spiritual as well as temporal
happiness of their Subjects, as he proves throughout his Ecclesiastical
History; and Sozomenus too his coaetanean and fellow Historian in his History.

Pope Leo the 1. flourishing about the year of Christ 450. with all the
Churches, Anno 450.
Clergy under him, Epist. 9. 13, 14 and 50, (...)
earnestly besought the Emperor Theodosius the younger with Epistles and Tears,
That he would command the General Council to be held within Italy; which he
would not grant, but summoned the Council at Ephesus, and them to appear
thereat. A clear confession of the Emperors, and disclaimer of his own
Ecclesiastical Superiority: especially if compared with his 24. and 25.
Epistles to the Emperor Theodofius, where he writes thus; Ecce ego,
Christianissime Imperator, consacerdotibus meis implens erga reverentiam
Clementiae vestrae synceri amoris officium, cupiensque vos per omnia placere
Deo, cui pro vobis ab Ecclesia supplicatur, etc. In his 59 Epist. to the
Emperor Martian, he writes thus, Unde ineffabiliter Deo gratias ago, qui eo
tempore quo oboritura Haereticorum scandala praesciebat Vos in Imperii fastigio
collocavit, in quibus ad totius mundi salutem, et regia potentia, et
Sacerdotalis vigeret industria. Epist. 60. to the Empress Pulcheria he thus
expresses himself, Per quam significationem Clementiae vestrae, absolute me
gaudere, et incessabilibus, a Deo precibus postulare, ut vos et Romanae
Reipublicae, et Catholicae Ecclesiae in omni prosperitate conservet. In his
Epist. 74. to the Emperor Leo, he writes; Non desinimus gratias agere, et
providentiam Dei, in fidei vestrae fervore benedidicere, qui sancto et
Catholico Spiritu, ita Haereticorum impudentiae restitistis. In his 78. Epistle
to the same Emperor, he begins thus. Multo gaudio men's mea exultat in Domino,
et magna mihi est ratio gloriandi, cum Clementiae vestrae excellentissimam
fidem augeri per omnia donis gratiae celestis agnosco, etc. Epist. 99. to the
same Emperor Leo he writes thus: Sciat igitur Clementia vestra omnes Ecclesias
Dei cum laud vestra exultare pariter et laetari. Inveniemur impares in
gratiarum action si nostri tantum oris angustiis Vniversalis Ecclesiae gaudia
celebremus, etc. Epistola 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, 23, 24, 29, 31, 33, 36, 37, 40,
41, 42, 43, to 54, 62, 67, 68, 71, 72, 73, 9^.
Yea this Pope himself in these and other his Epistles, exhorts all these
Emperors, to defend the Christian says against Heretics defined in the
Councils of Nice, Ephesus, and Chaelcedon, against all Heretics that opposed
their Creeds; by their Imperial Edicts to disannuall all Constitutions of
heretical Councils, Bishops; and repress all Heretics or Heresies contrary to
them, and not suffer them to redebate the Articles of faith established in them.

The same Pope Leo in his 7. Epistle highly commends Theodosius the Emperor,
for his most pious care of the true Christian faith and religion, Ne scilicet
in populo Dei, aut Schismata, aut Haereses, aut ulla scandala convaleseant. And
Epistola 33. writing of the Priscillianists and their Heresies first breaking
out in the world; he thus relates the zeal and Edicts of Princes then made
against them. Quando mundi Principes ita hanc sacrilegam amentiam detestati
sunt, ut Authorem ejus, ac plerosque discipulos legum publicarum ense
prosternerant. Videbant enim omnem curam honestatis auferri, simulque divinorum
jus humanumque subrui, si hujusmodi hominibus vivere, cum tali professione
licuisset. Et profuit diu ista districtio Ecclesiae lenitati; quae etsi
Sacerdotali contenta judicio, et cruentas refugit ultiones, severis tamen
Christianorum Principum constitutionibus adjuvatur, ut ad spirituale nomumquam
recurrant remedium, qui timent corporale supplicium. What stronger, clearer
evidence then these of this Pope Leo can we desire, to prove the Supremacy of
Christian Emperors, Princes in divine and Ecclesiastical affairs, and over
Popes themselves, and that they ought to take special care to preserve,
propagate the true Christian faith, and suppress all Heresies, Schisms, and
scandalous crimes repugnant thereunto

Primasius Bishop of Utica in Africa, Anno 450
in his Commentary on 1 Timothy 2. Orate pro Regibus, etc. thus descants; ut
cognoscant Deum, sive ut subjectas habeant Gentes; in illorum enim pace quies
nostra consistit; si enim Christiani sunt, cessabit persecutionis impetus. Hoc
enim bonum est, and acceptum coram salvatore nostro, Vt et vos (especially if
Christian Kings) sicut et ille, omnes homines salvari cupiatis* And Com: l. 2.
in Apoc. c. 17. p. 101, 102. He thus describes the Sovereign power of the Roman
Emperors typified by St. John: Proprie autem septem capita, septem montes, ut
Romam, quae super septem montes praesidet significans, omni quod orb
Monarchiae praefuit Dominatu, ad istorum Regum similitudinem adduxisset, and in
Roma inviniri totius Regnipotentiam figuraret. Septenario autem numero voluit
universalitatem ipsius Dominationis ost endere; as well over Popes, as others
within their Territories.

consisting of no less then 630. Bishops and Fathers of the Church, Surius
Council. Tom. 2. p. 8, 10, 11, 21, 16, 31, 102, 103, 106, 129, 142, 157, 158,

was summoned by the Emperors Martian and Valentinian, fidelium facta est
Synodus ex decreto piissimorum Imp. Martiani et Valentiniani. Martianus in his
Epistle to Pope Leo concerning its summons, writes thus; De studio and oratione
nostra, Sanctitas tua non dubitat, quoniam Christianorum religionem et
Catholicam fidem firmiter volumus permanere, et ab omni populo pia mente
servari. Denique sollicitudinem nostrae potentiae, ex recta religione et
propiciatione Salvatoris nostri consistere, non ambigunt. These Emperors
Valentinianus and Martianus in their Letters to this Council (first convened by
them at Nice) to remove to Chalcedon, since by reason of their other affairs
they could not repair to Nice, and their presence was necessary in this
Council, use this memorable expression; Illud enim praecavemus, licet Nos hic
publicae causae retineant, quoniam quae prosint verae et orthodoxae fidei, et
paci et disciplinae sanctarum Ecclesiarum, OMNIBUS ARBITRAMUR ESSE PRAEPONENDA,
nec dubitamus quia etiam vestrae sanctitati hoc placebit. Nos enim propter
ferventissimum Dei zelum, publicarum rerum necessarias utilitates in praesenti
distulimus, multum desiderantes ea; quae et orthodorae et verae sunt fidei,
tranquillitatis nostrae praesentia confirmari. Orare ergo dignemini pro nostro
Imperio, quatenus et hosts Nobis subditis efficiantur, et pax in Vniverso orb
firmetur, et Romanae res secure consistant; quod etiam nunc vos facere
iudicamus. In their Epistle to Dioscorus Patriarch of Antioch they write,
Cunctis constitit manifestum, quia nostrae reipublicae status, and omnia
humana, divina pietate moderantur atque firmantur. Deo enim propicio constituto
prospere and secundum vota nostra gubernari res and proficere solent. imperium
ergo divino nutu sortiti, subditis pro pietate et mansuetudine si militer
necessaria plurimam sollicitudinem impartimus, quatenus et vera religio, et
nostra respublica, cultu Dei purissimo, et pietate firma praefulgeat. When the
Council met at Chalcedon by their Summons, the Emperor Martianus, accompanied
with his Empress, and Senators, made a most pious Oration to them; with this
memorable Exordium. Cum primum per electionem in regnum de secreto Dei provecti
sumus, inter tantas publicas utilitates, nullum magis Nos constrinxit negotium
quam rectam et veram fidem Christianorum, quae sancta et veneranda consistit,
indubitatam omnibus declarare. Then taxing those Bishops and Clergymen who out
of avarice and vainglory had broached Heresies, to the prejudice of the
Orthodox faith, and Churches peace, which he had summoned them to settle by his
authority. He subjoyns, Nobis autem omne studium adhibendum est, ut populus
propter veram sanctamque doctrinam ipsum sentient uni rectae applicare
Ecclesiae. And therefore he exhorts them to address themselves with all
expedition and sincerity, truly to expound the Catholic faith, and disperse
the clowd of Error in this Synod; ut semper servantur quae statuta sunt. Erit
quidem divinae providentiae, quod pie fieri volumus, in seculo hoc confirmare
firmissima. Et post Regis haec verba, omnes Episcopi clamaverunt: Martiano novo
Constantino multi anni: Orthodoxis multi anni; Martiano amatori Christi, Regnum
vestrum in perpetuum permaneat, digni Orthodoxae fidei amatoris. In this
Council, the Emperor, and Gloriosissimi Judices, and amplissimus Senatus, are

first named in every Session, sat in the midst and chiefest place, and were
the Presidents, Moderators, chief Judges in this Council, as the frequent
repetitions of, Gloriossimi Judices and amplissimi Senatus, dixerunt, through
all the Acts and Sessions of this Council, resolve; and these often repeated
acclamations of the Bishops approving their decisions and resolves: Surius Tom.
2. p. 137, 138,
Multi anni Imperatoribus, Deus qui hoc fecit. Multi anni Imperatorum, Magnorum
Imperatorum multi anni, multi anni Senatus, multi anni Iudicum, Orthodoxorum
multi anni, Haec integra ab initio; haec pax Ecclesiarum. Piissimis et Christi
Amantibus nostris, nostris Imperatoribus Flavio Valentiniano, et Flavio
Martiano, Victoribus et Triumphatoribus semper Augustis, multi anni. Hence they
with diverse other Archimandritae, or Abbots in their Epistle to the Emperor
Martianus pray thus for him. Ut iterum per sanctos Patres sancta fide
confirmata, possimus reliquum tempus vitae nostrae cast and pie vivere, and in
pace incessanter consuetas orationes offerre Domino nostro Christo pro
diuturnitate aterni vestri Imperii, qui et sua bona voluntate invisibiliter,
nobis donavit Imperium Divinissimi Augusti. After this, Actio 6. Martianus the
Emperor making two Orations to the Council, the one in Latin, the other in
Greek, (Recorded in the Acts thereof.) All the whole Council at the end of both
his Oratitions cried out, Surius, p. 142, 145, 161, 197, 198.
Multi anni Imperatori, multi anni Augustae, Orthodoxis multos annos,
Imperatori multos Annos, Augustae Orthodoxae multos annos, Maritiano Amatori
Christi, vestrum nobis duret Imperium, semper nobis Imperatis, digne ex
Orthodoxa fide, Amatoribus Christi procul invidia. After which these Bishops
having tendered a Confession of their Faith to the Emperor, Omnes clamaverunt,
Omnes sic credimus, etc. Martiano novo Constantino, novo Paulo, novo David,
multos Annos, David Imperatori pro Domino, vitam ei, Novo Constantino, Novo
Martiano. Vos fides nostra; Christus quem honoras, ipse te eustodiet,
Orthodoxam fidem tu roborasti. Sicut Apostolici ita creditis, Augustae multos
annos. Vos lumina Orthodoxae fidei, propter haec ubique Pax est, lumina Pacis.
Domine tu custodi Luminaria mundi, Domine tu custodi. Perpetua memoria Novo
Constantino. Quae ex genere Orthodoxa est, Deus eam custodiat. Eam quae semper
pia est, Deus custodiat. Pia, Orthodoxa quae contraria est Haereticis, Deus eam
Custodiat. Omnes Haereticos tu fugasti, Nestorium et Eutichen tu persecutaes.
Absit invidia a vestro Imperio, fideles Imperatores sic honorantur. Deus
custodiat potestatem vestram, Deus pacificet imperium vestrum. Martianus novus
Constantinus, Pulcheria nova Helena. zelum Helenae tu sectaris, vestra vita
munimen cunctorum est, vestra fides Ecclesiarum Gloria est. Afterward the
Emperor rendering public thanks to God for Composing the manifold discords of
those who had erred concerning the Faith, and that now in unam eandemque
Religionem omnes nunc una voluntate convenerimus, sperantes celerrimam vestris
ad divinitatem Precibus et cura omnem pacem Nobis a Deo donari; Omnes
Clamaverunt, Haec digna vestro Imperio, Haec propria vestri regni, etc.
Coelestis Rex terrenum custodi. Per te fides firmata est Coelestis, Augustam
custodi. Per te fides firmata est. Vnus Deus qui hoc fecit, Coelestis Rex
Augustam custodi dignam paci, etc. Per vos Fides, per vos Par. Haec Oration
Ecclesiarum. Haec Oration Pastorum. Again. Omnes clamaverunt, Multos annos
Imperatori, Multos annos Augustis, Piae et Christianae Augustae Orthodoxae
multi anni. Multos annos piae et Matricae Christi, Imperium vestrum Deus
custodiat. In perpetuum maneat vestrum Imperium. In this Surius, Tom. 2. p. 25.

Council Actio 1. when some would have added an explanation to the Canon of the
Council of Nice, the Egyptian, Oriental and other Bishops cried out, Nemo
suscepit adjectionem, nemo diminu ionem. Quae in Nicea constituta sunt,
teneant; Catholicus Imperator hoc jussit. Quod Imperialis praecipit autoritas,
omnibus modis observandum est; Iustum est quae a piissimo Principe praecepta
erant effectui mancipari. Et necesse nobis erit in omnibus Imperatoris Christi
amore cedere jussioni. Omnia referantur ad cognitionem Clementiae Imperialis,
postulamus ejus referri Clementiae, etc. Iussum est a Domino orbis terrae, ut
Synodus de Flaviano prius judicaret. Actio 11. Bassianus Bishop of Ephesus
humbly petitioned the Emperors Valentinian and Martian, to be restored to his
Bishopric, and goods, of which he was forcibly dispossessed by Soldiers,
without hearing ut iis petitis consuetas Orationes referam, incessanter Deo pro
vestrae Potestatis Imperio. In this Council, there are frequent recitals of
Sancta and magna and Vniversalis Synodus quae gratia Dei secundum Sanctionem
piissimorum, Surius, Tom. ^. p. 11, 20, 21, 27, 132, 133, 102, 103, 106, 120.
et Deo amantis suorum Imperatorum immaculata collecta est in Chalcedonensi
Civitate. Imperator Episcopos vocavit. Placuit et nunc piissimis et
Christianissimis Imperatoribus nostris sancire, sanctam et magnam vestram
Synodum huc concurrere quatenus quae nuper emerserunt de catholica and
immaculata nostra fide quaerantur; et ea radicitus evellantur; and ne forte
trahentia and retrahentia, simplicissimos aliquos in foveam perfidis et erroris
impingent, quia tanta eis est de pietate solicitudo, et ut ea custodiantur in
perpetuum, inconcussa et immaculata quae de Orthodoxa Religione nostra pridem
quidem a beatissimis patribus quae in Nicea convenerunt sunt exposita. Their
Letters of Summons sent to Dioscorus Bishop of Alexandria, and other Bishops,
begin thus. Imperatores Caesares, etc. Omnibus constat manifestum, quia nostrae
reipublicae dispositio et universa humana per pietatem circa Deum continentur
et confirmantur. When this General Council, by the Emperors Judges and Senators
approbation, had finished their determinations concerning the Christian faith;
the Emperors ratified them by their Imperial Laws, Edicts, prohibiting all
Conventicles, Disputations, Heresies, and Books against them, as their Laws
recorded in Surius, Tom. 2. p. 133, 134 etc.
Surius, Codicis, lib. 1. Tit. 4. Lex 3, 4.
Justinian, and others (over tedious to relate) demonstrate: wherein they
declare, Tandem aliquando quod summis votis atque studiis optabamus, evenit.
Remota est de Orthodoxa Christianorum lege contentio; tandem remedia culpabilis
erroris inventa sunt, et discors populorum sententia in unum consensum
concordiamque convenit. Cessat igitur jam prophana contentio. Nam in
contemptores hujus Legis poena non deerit, quia non solum contra fidem been
compositam veniunt, sed etiam Iudaeis et Paganis ex hujusmodi certamine
prophanant veneranda mysteria. Sacro nostrae Serenitatis Edicto venerandam
Synodum confirmantes, admonuimus Vniversos, ut de religione disputare desinant,
etc. In this General Council of Chalcedon, I shall observe these three Passages
relating to the Glorious Lay-Judges, and Senate presiding therein by the
Emperors appointment. 1. That when the Surius Council. Tom. 2. p. 17.
Bishops in the Synods first Session, were divided against each other, in the
Cases of Theodoretus and Dioscorus, some crying out against the one, that he
should be thrust out of the Synod; others, that he should sit, and the other
side excluded: Impugnatorem Dei for as mittite, Judaeum for as mittite;
Seditiosos for as mittite, etc. Multos annos Augustae, Catholico Imperatori
multos annos. Thereupon Gloriosissimi Iudices et amplissimus Senatus dixerunt,
Acclamationes istae populares neque Episcopos decent, neque parts juvant. 2.
That in the debates concerning the Orthodox faith, Ibid. p. 101, 103; 106.
Gloriosissimi Judices et amplissimus Senatus dixerunt, in judicio fidei non
est is^a defensio. De Recta quidem and Catholica side, perfectius sequenti die
convenienti Concilio, diligentierem Examinationem fieri oportere perspicimus.
Nunc autem hoc quaerendum and studendum and judicandum est, ut vera fides
contineatur, pro qua maxim and Concilium facturi est, etc. directing the
Bishops how to proceed therein, and informing them of the Emperors resolution
and their own concerning it, in these words; Scire enim vos velumus quia tam
divinissimus and piissimus Orbis terrarum Dominus, quam Nos, Catholicam fidem a
318. and a 150. necnon etiam a caeteris sanctissimis and gloriosissimis
patribus traditam, custodimus, and secundum ipsam credimus; Whereupon,
Reverendissimi Episcopi clamant; Expositionem alteram nullus facit, neque
tentamus, neque audemus exponere. Docuerunt eam Patres, and in scriptis
custodiantur quae ab eis sunt exposita, and citra ea dicere non possumus.
Sufficient quae exposita sunt, alteram expositionem non licet fieri.
Gloriosissimi Judices and amplissimus Senatus dixerunt, Recitentur quae
exposita sunt a Sanctis 318 Patribus in Nicea congregatis. Whereupon the Nicene
Creed was read, with the Epistle of Leo, and other Treatises in defense
thereof: then voted by the Judges, Senate, Council, and ratified by the
Emperors Edicts. 3ly. That when the complaints of the Orthodox Bishops unjustly
deprived in a former Council at Ephesus by Dioscorus and others, were there
fully heard, the former proceedings against them read, and Witnesses examined
by the Judges with those who deposed them; the Judges and Senate, not the
Council, gave this final sentence therein; Gloriosissimi Iudices, et
amplissimus Senatus, dixerunt: Quoniam vero Flavianus religiosae memoriae,
Ibidem, p. 102. 103. 106. Cent. Magd. 5. col. 934, 935.
and Eusebius reverendus Episcopus ex gestorum and cogniionum scrutatione, and
ipsa voce quorundam qui huic Synodo praefuerint, confitentium se errasse, and
frustra eos damnasse: quia nihil circa fidem monstrantur crasse, ostenduntur
injuste depositi, Videtur nobis (secundum quod Deo placitum est) Iustum esse
(si placuerit divinissimis et pussimis Dominis nostris) eidem paellae Dioscorum
reverend. Episcopum Alexandriae, and Juvenalem reverendum Episcopum
Hierosolymorum, and Thalassium reverend. Episcopum Caesariae Cappadociae, and
Eusebium reverend. Episcopum Ancyrae, and Eustathium reverend. Episcopum
Beryti, and Basileum reverend. Episcopum Seleucite Isauriae, qui potestatem et
principatum Synodi tenuerunt, subjecere, et a sancto Concilio secundum regulas,
ab Episcopali dignitate fieri alienos, omnibus quae acta sunt, ad sacrum Apicem
(the Emperors) referendis. Hereupon Orientales, and qui cum ipsis reverendi
Episcopi, clamaverunt, Hoc justum Iudicium: Multos annos Senatui, multos annos
Imperatoribus. Impius semper fugit, Dioscorum Christus deposuit; Homicidam
Christus deposuit: Haec justa sententia; Hoc justum concilium: Iustus Senatus,
Iustum Concilium; which they often repeated. On the other side, Illyriani
Episcopi dixerunt; Omnes erravimus, omnes veniam mereamur. Has preces Concilio
Catholico, has preces Augusto; Omnes peccavimus, omnibus indulgeatur precamur;
omnes peccavimus, omnium miseremini. Omnes peccavimus, omnibus indulgete.
Dioscorum in Synodo, Nicephorus. Eccles. Hist. l. 45. c. 4. 8 Cent. Magd. 5.
col. 55.
Dioscorum in Ecclesiis. These Interlocutions ended, Magnificentissimi, et
gloriosissimi, et amplissimus Senatus et Iudices dixerunt, Quae interlocuta
sunt, effectui mancipantur. After this judgment Dioscorus, was deprived and
banished accordingly by the Emperor, and Proterus substituted in his place.
4ly. It is observable what Surius, Ibid. p. 55.
Melipthongus spoke in this Council and debate, Quoniam igitur piissimus
Imperator ex avita traditione consuevit orthodoxam continere fidem. Et in
nullas sanctas regulas irrumpere, postulamus ejus referri Clementiae. Et si
jusserit in criminali causa alterum pro altero decertare, et hoc suscipimus,
praecipue quia universalem praecepit fieri Synodum. All which irrefragable
Passages infallibly demonstrate these Emperors Supremacy in all religious and
Ecclesiastical affairs in that age; and that they reputed the maintenance,
propagation of the true Orthodox faith, and their peoples spiritual Welfare;
the principal part of their Regal care, and Imperial office.

These Religious zealous Emperors, as they ratified the Decrees for the
Orthodox Faith made in this General Council of Chalcedon, Anno 451
so they did by this their Edict confirm those of the Council of Nice, summoned
and formerly ratified by Constatine the Great, Justin. Cod: lib. 1. Tit. 4.
Lex. 2, 3.
Vnius et summi Dei nomen ubique celebretur: Nicenae fidei dudum a majoribus
traditae, et divinae Religionis testimonio atque assertione firmatae
observantia semper mansura teneat. Nullus haereticis ministeriorum locus,
nullam ad exercendam animi obstinatioris dementiam pateat occasio, etc.

In the General Council of Chalcedon, Anno 451
Actio 11. I find this Supplicatory Letter and Petition of Bassianus to the
Emperors Valentinianus and Martianus, beginning thus; Surius, Tom. 2. p. 180,
181, to 18^
Terrae, marisque et totius humani generis Dominis (therefore of all Popes
certainly) Flaviis Valentimano et Martiano perpetuis Augustis, Supplicatio and
deprecatio, a Bassiano humili and pusillo Episcopo. Omnis salus violentiam
patientium post Deum vestra tranquillitas est, praecipue autem Sacerdotum
Christi. Quapropter et ego ad has preces veni, provolutus vestigiis vestris, ut
mei misereamini. Then relating his case and grievance in being forcibly thrust
out of the Bishopric of Ephesus to which he was elected, of which he had 4.
years possession, by Stephanus then Bishop; He adds, Supplico vestrae pietati,
et volvor divinis vestris sacratis vestigiis, quatenus sancire dignetur vestra
caelestis potestas, sacra vestra subnotatione missa ad sanctum Concilium, ut
cognitio fiat inter me miserrimum et eos qui in me talia praesumpserint, etc.
Whereupon the Emperors referred his cause to the examination of the Council;
where both parties are heard; Et gloriosissimi Iudices, appointed by the
Emperors to preside in this Council, not the Bishops, directed the proceedings,
examine the cause, and pronounce the Sentence, that both of them should be
removed, as unduly elected and ordained, but retain the name of Bishops, that
Bassianus should have an annual pension out of it during his life, and
restitution to all goods taken from him, upon due proof thereof.

In the Surius. Tom. 2 p. 186
same General Council, Actio 13. Eunomius Bishop of Nicomedia, and all his
Clergy, exhibited the like Petition to these Emperors, beginning as the former,
Terrae, marisque, et totius gentis hominum Dominis, etc. Deus vobis Imperium,
ut omnes gubernetis (therefore Popes, as well as others) ad salutem orbis
terrarum, et pacem sanctarum Ecclesiarum just donavit: Quapropter ante omnia,
et per omnia (mark it) piissimi et Christi amantissimi Principes pro orthodoxae
et saluberrimae fidei dogmatibus cogitatis, tam haereticorum fremitus
extinguentes, quam pia ad lucem dogmata deducentes. Vnde prosternimus nos
Majestatis vestrae vestigiis, ut jubeatis arceri injustitiam quae adversum nos
a reverendissimo Episcopo Niceno Anastatio est praesumpta, quatenus valeamus
congrua pace fruentes sine intermissione divina mysteria perficere, et
consuetas orationes Domino Deo pro aeterna vestra potestate solvamus. Their
complaint was, that Anastatius, neque honorem Dei prae oculis sumens, neque
leges vestrae pietatis reveritus, had invaded their rights, quas nobis pietatis
vestris legibus and Ecclesiasticis sanctionibus sunt collata, quae nullus
aliquando praecessorum ejus jubere aut movere tentavit. Both parties are heard,
and their case examined as the former, by the Gloriosissimi Judices; not
Bishops.

Surius, ibid. 188, 189.
In the 14th Action of this Council, I meet with this memorable Petition of
Salvinianus, Paros Episcopi, somewhat varying from the former, Piissimis et
Christo amantissimis, et digne a Deo omnium honoratis Augustis Valentiniano and
Martiano, preces and supplicatio, a Salviniano Episcopo. Dominus omnium videns
Apostolicam et Orthodoxam fidem a dissimulatoribus interim fatigari, et omnem
mundum seditionibus vexari, et suscitavit vestram pietatem universum mundum
regere atque gubernare, et tumultus qui a nefandis exorti sunt, sanctorum
doctrina reprimere, et claritatem atque soliditatem recti dogmate confirmare.
Vnde just vestrae tranquilitati ac de vobis dicit Deus, Psalm. 8^.
Exaltavi electum de plebe mea, Inveni David servum meum, etc. Credens itaque
nutu divino super omnem principatum ac dominationem consistere vestrum
Principatum (therefore above the Popes, and Councils) adsum supplicans et
rogans vestram pietatem, ut mei providentiam fieri, et causam meam examinari
praecipiatis; Ego enim a puero eram in Monasterio dispensator omnium rerum,
nihil de Episcopatu cogitans, neque rogans quemquam hujus gratia dignitatis.
Dum ergo essem in Monachorum providentia constitutus, adstitit mihi repent
illius temporis Metropolitanus Episcopus cum provincialibus Episcopis, and me
Paros ordinavit Episcopum, de qua in scriptis dejectus est Athanasius, ex
gravissim is capitibus accusatus, nec volens pro illatis sibi criminibus
reddere rationem, qui aliquando quidem Episcopatum repudiabat. Frequenter vero
citationes vocantium cum ad Synodorum judicium, declinabat. Is enim in Ephesina
Synodo ex praecepto Alexandrini praesulis in meam Ecclesiam superingressus est,
and ego, praeter voluntatem meam ordinatus, expulsus sum. Et haec quidem ecta
sunt habitatoribus illius civitatis dolentibus and lugentibus meam expulsionem.
Supplico igitur et vestrae potentiae, ut jubeatis meam causam sub praesentia
vestrae pietatis examinari, et placitum terminum dari; ut et ego cum cunctis
aliis consuetas orationes pro perpetua vestra potentia semper exolvam, Piissimi
atque victores Principes. Salvianus Episcopus dictata et subscripsi et offero
vestrae pietati. Baeronicianus vir devotissimus, Secretarius divini Consistorii
legit. This Cause, and all the proceedings in it in two former Councils of
Ephesus and Antioch, were fully heard, read and considered, and at last
referred by the Judges themselves to Maximus Bishop of Antioch to settle,
Salvianus in the mean time being to enjoy the Title of the Bishop of Paros, and
receive maintenance out of it.

I find in Ecclesiast. Hist. l. 2. c. ^8.
Evagrius (but not in the Acts of this Council) a like Petition from Eusebius
Bishop of Dorileum; beginning thus, It behooves your Majesty's (most noble and
puissant Emperors) to provide carefully for the quieting of all your loving
Subjects, and to defend from injuries all other men, but especially the sacred
Senate of Priesthood. And herein the divine Godhead, which has granted unto
you the rule and domination of the whole world, is truly honored; wherefore
seeing the Christian faith, and we our selves also have been oppressed, and
unjustly molested by extreme wrong by Dioscorus, the most Reverend Bishop of
the most Noble City of Alexandria, we are now come unto your wonted Clemency,
to crave Justice at your hands. Then complaining of his and Flavianus Bishops
of Constantinoples unjust depositions from their Bishoprics in the Council of
Ephesus, by the power and unjust practices of Dioscorus; and accusing him of
Blasphemy and Heresy; he Petitions the Emperors on his bended knees, that his
Petition might by his Letters be referred to the Council; that both their
doings might therein by justly examined, and indifferently heard before them,
and then certified to their Imperial Majesty's, to do them right.

By all which Petitions, even of these Bishops themselves, the Sovereign
Authority of Christian Emperors and Kings in and over all Ecclesiastical
causes; persons, and in matters of faith, religion, and final Right of Appeals
to them from unjust Judgments given not only by Bishops, but General Councils
in the very case of deprivation of Bishops for Heresy and Ecclesiastical
offenses, Anno 458
is so clearly set forth by words and actions, that nothing can be more full
and satisfactory. Evagrius Eccles. Hist. l. 2. c. 8, 9: Nicephorus Eccles. l.
15. c. 18, etc* Surius Council. Tom. 2. p. 224, 225, etc.


The Emperor Leo by his Letters to all Metropolitans in the very beginning of
his reign, confirmed the Orthodox faith professed heretofore by his
Predecessors; yet notwithstanding, the Heretical faction at Alexandria, in the
absence of Dionysius Captain of the Garrison, elected Timotheus Aelius (an
heretic, and oppugner of the Council of Chalcedon) for their Bishop, and
barbarously slew Proterius their orthodox Bishop, thrusting Timotheus into his
place; whereupon all the Bishops of Egypt and Clergy of Alexandria by a
supplicatory Epistle complained to this Emperor Leo the 1. of this outrage,
desiring Justice and redress: wherein they relate, A superna gratia modo
divinitus condonatus, just non cessas pro communi utilitate cogitare, post
Deum cunctorum venerabilis Imperator. Quapropter omnis fortitudo verborum tuis
vincitur actibus. Nuper enim electus a Deo et purpura exornatus optimum
judicasti propositum tuum magnum ostendere, quem ipse omnium Creator elegit,
benignius initiis largitatem remunerando bonorum, quando repent in ipso
principio voce vestra ex scripto procedente piissimo, ad Sanctissimos
Metropolitanos, Episcopos, inerumpibilem Ecclesiae Catholicae crepidinem
roborasti, et priorum omnium, piiss imorumque Principum constituta, pro
Orthodora religione firmasti. Insuper and ea, quae nuper a sanctae memoriae
Martiano, Principe nostro sancita sunt consona decernente, nihil (...) estis
mercati, quam pacem omnium and stabilitatem reipublicae, fraenantes linguas
eorum qui adversus Ecclesias consurgunt, et blasphemant Deum, aut in cum
quecunque modo delinquunt. Injuria namque Dei manifesta est, haereticorum
alscindentium semetipsos a recta ^ide, licentia. Quapropter hoc optime sciens
ven^rabilis Imperator, maligni prolem existere insidiantes quieti sanctarum
Christi semper Ecclesiarum, earumque immutilatam pacem consistere non scientes,
recte provi^^^^rum tuam studuisti mox adhiberi, ei per omnia resistentem, QUOD
EST OPUS PIISSIMORUM PRINCIPUM (let Popes and Prelates observe it) pro
orthodo^a wfide pugnantium, et resistentium (...) malis extrinsecus
venientibus, ET ANIMABUS FIDELIUMADVERSANTIBUS. Hunc igitur animum te
possidente religiosum et tutorem humani generis tantumque circa Christum
studium demonstrantem, adimus ex nos, importabilia mala passi, licet peccatores
Christi Pontifices: Then relating their grievances, the election of Timotheus,
the murder of Proterius, the growth of heresy, opposing the orthodox faith,
and violent thrusting them out of their Churches, at large, to the Emperor,
thus pray redress from him as their only Supreme Ecclesiastical Judge and
Protector. Sanciri praecipite ut expulsi sine calumnia ad suas Ecclesias, in
pace celebrantes, pro vestra pietate solennes orationes, cum quiet servari,
urbemque pariter et in ea sanctas Ecclesias constitutas ad Christi gloriam et
salutem, et perpetuitatem vestrae Christianissimae pietatis; Literas
dirigentes, pro his quae poscimus ad magnificentissimum Dionysium Ducem, necnon
ad singularum provinciarum Iudices (not to the Pope, or any Clergymen)
quatenus ea quae a vestra mansuetudine sunt sancita, et servantur, et effectui
contradantur. Hereupon this pious Emperor presently sent abroad his Letters to
all the Cities, Su^^us Council. Tom. 2. p. 224. Nicephorus, l. 15. c. 18, etc.
Bishops and Churches under his Empire; wherein he declares, Votum quidem mei
pietatis fuit universas orthodoxorum sanctas Ecclesias, necnon et Civitates sub
Romano Imperio constitutas, maxima frui quiet, nihilque contingere, quod
possit earum statum tranquillitatemque turbare, etc. Then relating the tumults
at Alexandria in electing Timotheus their Bishop; he requires them all to
summon all their Bishops and Clergy together, and examining all these things
with deliberate care and fidelity, to certify him their several opinions
concerning his election, and the Council of Chalcedons determinations. This
they accordingly did, by their respective Letters returned to the Emperor
collected by Tom. 2 p. 224. to 277.
Surius; being 38. in number (one from Pope Leo the 1.) subscribed with above
500 Bishops hands, wherein they approve the Council of Chalcedon, desiring the
Emperor to ratify it by his new Imperial Edicts, condemn Timotheus and
election, and most lively, fully set forth and acknowledge the Emperors
Supremacy in and over all Religious, Ecclesiastical persons and affairs, in
preserving the Orthodox faith, peace and unity of the Church, suppressing
Heretics, Schisms, redressing all undue elections, abuses of Bishops and
others, as the principal part of his Regal Office, Trust, Care; and inform him:
Pietatis vestrae et Christianitatis Imperium clarior purpura atqueniademate pro
fidei causa ^ucet. In imperio supra purpuras et diadema (...) rectitudine
decoratur et (...), That, a Christo regalia sceptra percipientes,
compensationem rursus Deo redditis vestram Imperium conservante, dum
incessabiliter cogitatis, quatenus securam ab omni haeretica tempe state

caelitus divino nutu suo munivit, ut ea quidem, quae sacra sunt, Imperiali
potestate integra semper salvaque custodiantur; quae vero vexata sunt atque
corrupta, vestrae pietatis medicina curetis. Nihil itaque Deo amabilius est,
nihil acceptius, quam ut illa vos sapiatis, quae a Dei patris sapientia
didicistis, et illa doceatis, quae ab ipsis fidei vestrae incunabulis
saluberrime estis eruditi. Vestrae igitur pietatis est, sanctissimum etiam in
hoc agere zelum, etc. quae legibus et sacris canonibus, et cunctis Dei
Ecclesiis pacem confer videantur. Pro Dei legibus dimicastis, velut integri
custodes earum, et sanctorum habentes curam. Then commending his care for the
external peace, prosperity of his subjects, they subjoyn: Et hac quidem quantum
ad consolationem pertineat corporalem pro ejus utilitate gerere vestra
serenitas non quiescit; potiorem vero habet industriam ut fidei orthodoxae
cultus in hominum animabus oriatur (note it) quatenus vestra pietate adducentur
Regi Regum, qui a Deo ut essent, plasmati sunt. Hanc itaque devotionem
possidens, apud D^um and sanctas Ecclesias multiplicare quotidie stud^ns vestra

laudandum Constantinum, and tenendo vestigia piae memoriae Martiani, pro pace
Ecclesiarum maximam diligentiam gerit vestra religio, Nota.
etc. Surius, Tom. 2. p. 245.
Quem alterum decebat Imperatorem talia pro talibus praecipere, et scribere

in terra firmavit regnum, et pietatis radios in terra mixtos omni caligine, ex

All their Epistles are fraught with these and the like passages, expressions,
prayers, then which nothing can be more demonstrative, to evidence his
Ecclesiastical Supremacy, and all Princes Sovereign care of Religion and Church
affairs, against all Papal or Pontifical cavils in succeeding degenerous times.
After reception and perusal of these Epistles to this Emperor from all quarters
of the Empire, he by his Imperial decrees ratified the Councils of Nice,
Ephesus, Chalcedon; expelled, banished Timotheus, and suppressed Heretics in
all places, to the joy of all good Christians, and advancement of Christianity.

The Emperor Zeno (who succeeded Leo) to compromise the differences then in the
Church about the Orthodox faith and Councils of Nice and Chalcedon, Anno 484.
published a pacifical Edict, Niceph Eccles. Hist. l. 16. c. 12.
which he entitled Henoticum, with this Prologue Cum Imperii nostri initium et
conservationem, tum autem opes et armaturam inexpugnabilem persuasum habeamus
esse, Solam rectam et veram fidem quam divina inspiratione Nicaeae 318. sancti
Patres congregati promulgarunt, et Constantinopoli 150. itidem sancti Patres
coacti confirmaverunt, die noctuque precationibus, studiis, LEGIBUSQUE NOSTRIS
OMNIBUS hoc agimus, ut per eam ubique locorum sancta Dei Catholica et
Apostolica Ecclesia incrementa capiat, qnae incorruptibilis et immortalis
sceptrorum nostrorum matter, et pii populi nostri, in pace et religionis divinae
concordia persistentes, acceptabiles pro Imperio nostro preces, una cum Dei
amantissimis Episcopis, et piissimis Clericis et Archimandratis et Monachis
fundant, etc. Itaque quum fides irreprehensibilis et Nos, et Imperium sic
conservet; Scire vos volumus, neque nos, neque ubique socorum quae sunt
Ecclesias aliud symbolum, aut doctrinam aut formulam fidei, aut fidem etiam
praeterquam quod (sicut dictum est) a 318 editum, et 150 Patribus comprobatum
est, sanctum sumbolum vel habuisse, vel habere, vel habituros esse. Nam id
solum Symbolum, Imperium nostrum conservare confidimus. Quemlibet vero qui
aliud quicquam sensit, aut sentit, aut nunc, aut quandocunque, vel Chalcedone,
vel quacunque alia Synodo, ANATHEMATI SUBJICIMUS; praecipue vero Nestorium et
Eutychen, et qui cum eis idem sentiunt. Consurgite ergo vos per unionem
spirituali matri Ecclesiae per id unum et solum 318 sanctorum Patrum
professionis fidei decretum. Quod si feceritis, Domini et Servatoris et Dei
nostri Jesus Christi benignitatem vobis ipsis conciliabitis, tum ab Imperiali
nostra amplitudine laudem eximiam feretis. This Imperial Edict being publicly
read in Alexandria in the Church before all the people by Peter Mogge their
Bishop, Alexandrini universi sanctae et Catholicae Ecclesiae conjuncti unitique
sunt, et quaecunque in medio fuere offendicula et impedimenta sustulere, writes
Niceph. Eccl. Hist. l. 16. c. 12.
Nicephorus. This Emperor Zeno resolved to thrust out Timotheus Aelius Bishop
of Alexandria, complained of to, and removed, banished by the Emperor Leo, (as
you heard before) yet restored by the Usurping Emperor Basiliscus to his See
after 18. years exile; but understanding he was very aged and like to die, he
altered his resolution; He dying soon after, the Alexandrians without this
Emperors license or privity, elected one Peter Mogge, (a man then unsound in
the faith) for their Bishop, who was consecrated by two heretical Bishops. The
Emperor being informed thereof, removed Peter by his Letters after 36. days
possession, and by other Letters restored Timotheus Salophaciolus (the
rightful Bishop dispossessed by the other Timothy, banished by Basiliscus) to
this See, putting those to death who elected Peter. After which the Clergy of
Alexandria sending an Embassy to the Emperor, by one John and others; He
granted them Liberty after the death of Timothy to elect whom they would for
their Bishop, except this John, who took an Oath before the Emperor, haud
unquam se Alexandriae thronum accepturum esse, and so departed. Yet after
Timothies death, John forgetting and neglecting his Oath, by money procured
himself to be advanced to this See by the Alexandrians: Of which the Emperor
being informed, he commanded Niceph. Calistus, Eccles: Hist. l. 16. c. 1^, 16,
17. Platina, Onup^rius and Lydius (...) Felice 3
John to be ejected, and restored Peter Mogge to the Sea by his Letters, who
promised to read, publish and observe the Emperors forecited Decree Henoticum;
which he accordingly performed. John being thus ejected, resorts to Rome to
Pope Felix the 3d. complaining, he was ejected only for defending the Doctrine
of the Emperor Leo, and Council of Chalcedon: who writ a Letter to Zeno
reprehending him for John's illegal ejection and desiring his restitution: who
answered, He ejected him not for the cause suggested, but for his perjury.
After this he exhibited a Libel of complaints to Pope Felix the 3. (about the
year 483) complaining against Peter as an Heretic, and against Acacius Bishop
of Constantinople for holding communion with him, and being the chief
instrument of his restitution: and in a Synod at Rome procured Peter (formerly
condemned, banished, and excommunicated by a Synod) to be declared an Heretic,
and deprived, especially quod quum ab haereticis consecratus est, orthodoxis
praeesse non potest: and in their Sentence they blamed Acacius as guilty of a
great crime, quod ad Simplicium scribens, Petrum haereticum appellaverat, et id
Impetatori non indicaverit; quum certe id si Zenonem diligeret, facere
debuerit; Perinde sicut apparet, commodi ^ui desiderio Imperatorem complectitur
(as many Bishops in all ages did) fidem autem non complectitur. But they
continuing in their Sees notwithstanding this Sentence, so far contemned the
Popes and Synods Authority, that Acacius, Papae (Felicis) nomen ex sacro albo
exemit; which Flavitas afterward upon a difference between him and Peter of
Alexandria (who condemned the Synod of Chalcedon) suis ipse manibus in sacris
tabulis Mogge nomen expunxit, Ann^ 538
and Felicis appellationem reposuit. Peter continuing Bishop still by the
Emperors restitution and protection, notwithstanding the Popes and Roman Synods
sentence of deprivation; Pope Gelasius (succeeding Felix) takes upon him to
declare the Emperors restitution of Peter after his deprivation by a Synod, to
be void, (if the Sea Cooks Censura Patiu^, and Dr. James Bastardy of the
Fathers
Decrees and Epistles be his own, and not forged, as I suspect, by the style
and subject matter, improper to, and unknown in that age) upon these mistaken
Papal grounds: Surius Council: Tom. 2. p. 300. to 310.
Imperatori tantum de humanis rebus judicare permissum est, non etiam praeesse
divinis: quomodo de his, per quos divina ministrantur judicare praesumant?
Fuerint haec ante adventum Christi, ut quidam figuraliter, adhuc tamen in
carnalibus actionibus constituti, pariter Reges existerent et pariter
Sacerdotes; quod Sanctum Genesis 14. Heb. 7.
Melchisedechem fuisse sacra prodit historia: Quod in suis quoque Diabolus
imitatus est, utpote qui semper quae divino cultui convenirent, sibimet
tyrannico spiritu vindicare contendit, ut Pagani Imperatores, iidem et maximi
Pontifices crearentur. Sed cum ad verum ventum est eundem Regem atque
Pontificem, ultra sibi nec Imperator Pontificis nomen imposuit, nec Pontifer
Regale fastigium vindicavit: (In that age 'twas true, but diverse Here, p. 34,
to 40. 79, 80.
Popes since have usurped it as of right) Quamvis enim membra ipsius very Regis
atque Pontificis, secundum participationem naturae, magnifice utrumque in sacra
generositate sumpsisse dicantur, ut 1 Pet. 2.
simul Regale genus et Sacerdotale subsistant; attamen Christus memor
fragilitatis humanae, quod suorum saluti congruerit dispensatione magnifica
temperans, sic actionibus propriis, dignitatibusque destinatis officia
potestatis utriusque discrevit, suos volens medicinali humilitate salvari, non
humana superbia rursus intercipi, ut et Christiani Imperatores pro aeterna vita
Pontificibus indigerent, (as to their doctrine, instruction, advice, not supreme
inherent Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction) et Pontifices pro temporalium cursu rerum
dispositionibus (yea of Ecclesiastical and divine too, as the premised and
subsequent Authorities infallibly evidence, though this Pope here denies it)
uterentur, quatenus: spiritualis actio a carnalibus distaret incursibus: 2 Timothy
2.
Et ideo, militans Deo minime se negotiis secularibus implicaret (why then do
all Popes, and most Bishops the contrary?) ac vicissim, nolle rebus divinis
praesidere videatur, qui esset negotiis secularibus implicatus: (his Argument
holds not, e converso, since all Christians, especially Kings, ought to meddle
with divine matters, and things of faith, without which they can neither know,
serve, worship God, or be saved themselves, nor govern their Christian subjects
as they ought) et ut modestia utriusque ordinis conaretur, ne extolleretur
utroque su^fultus, et competens qualitatibus actionum, specialiter professio
aptaretur, (From which mistaken premises, this Pope draws this conclusion; (one
of the first I meet with directly opposing the Emperors Ecclesiastical
Authority, except that of St. Ambrose, in a different case, when Emperors
command things directly against God and the Scriptures) Quibus omnibus rite
collectis, evidenter satis ostenditur a seculari potestate nec ligari prorsus,
nec solvi posse Pontificem. Quo manifestius approbatur, Alexandrinum Petrum per
Imperialem solummodo sententiam nullo modo potuisse absolvi: being condemned,
deprived by the Synod at Rome and Pope Felix: ubi si Pontificum quoque sociatur
assensus, quaerimus utrum praecesserit, an fuerit subsecutus? Si subsecutus
est, nihilominus ad id reditur; ut absolutio seculari potestate praecepta, et
principaliter inchoata, valere non possit: pontificumque secutus assensus,
adulationis potius fuerat, quam legitimae sanctionis. Si praecessit, doceatur a
quibus, and ubi ille sit gestus, secundum Ecclesiae regulam celebratus; si
paterna traditione profectus, si majorum more prolatus, si competenti
examinatione depromptus? Ubi proculdubio requirendum est, Si Synodali
congregatione celebratus, quod in receptione damnati, and depulsione catholici,
quia nova est causa, fieri debuisse certissimum est. In fine, he concludes,
that Peter and Acacius being condemned a prima sede, (by which he means the Sea
and Council of Rome) could not be absolved nor restored by the Emperor himself,
nor by a Synod of the Clergy held at Constantinople, or elsewhere, but only by
the Sea of Rome, nec ab inferiore quolibet (praecipue cum de secundae sedis
ageretur Antistite, to wit, Acacius of Constantinople) sed a prima sede jure
possit absolvi. Inferior quippe potiorem absolvere non potest: sola ergo potior
inferiorem convenienter absolvit. A doctrine inconsistent with the practice and
proceedings of that age, as the premises, and the deprivations, restitutions of
many Bishops by the Emperors, as well Orthodox as Heterodox, recorded by
Eusebius, Socrates Scholasticus, Sozomen, Tripartita Historia, Nicephorus, and
others, abundantly evidence. This Pope Gelasius in his Surius Council. Tom. 2.
p. 301, 302.
Commonitorium ad Faustum, his Legate sent to Constantinople, has the like
passages: Quod si dicunt, Imperator hoc fecit (that he restored Peter and
Acacius) hoc ipsum quibus canonibus, quibus regulis est praeceptum? As if
Emperors must do nothing but what Popes and Bishops prescribe, or permit them
by their Canons. In his Epistle to Ibid. p. 303, 304.
Anastasius the Emperor about the same business; after this complement Romanus
natus, Romanum Principem amo, colo, suspicio, and sicut Christianus cum eo, qui
zelum Dei habet, secundum scientiam veritatis habere desidero, and qualiscumque
Apostolicae sedis Vicarius (a phrase not usual in that age) quodcunque plenae
fidei catholicae deesse comperero, pro meo modulo snggestionibus opportunis
supplere contendo; He thus proceed^ Pietatem tuam absit (quaeso a Romano
Principe) ut intimatam suis sensibus veritatem, arbitretur injuriam. Gratian

Duo quippe sunt, Imperator Auguste, quibus principaliter Mundus hic regitur,
authoritas sacra Pontificum, et Regalis potestas. In quibus tanto gravius est
pondus sacerdotum, quanto etiam pro ipsis regibus hominum in Divino reddituri
sunt examine rationem, (And must not Kings too give an account for Bishops and
Priests under them, if they permit unworthy ones, or enforce them not by their
Laws to discharge their pastoral duties? No doubt they must.) Nosti etenim
fili Clementissime, quod licet praesideas humano generi dignitate, rerum tamen
Praesulibus divinarum devotus colla submittis (this is untrue in point of
Jurisdiction) atque ab eis causas tuae salutis expetis (as from his Ministers,
not Superiors) inque sumendis Coelestibus Sacramentis eisque (ut competit)
disponendis subdi te debere cognoscis (in point only of Administration, not of
Power or Jurisdiction) religionis ordine potius quam praeesse. Itaque inter
haec ex illorum te Pendere Judicio (as his Advisers, not Superiors) non illos
ad tuam velle redigi voluntatem, (unless in case of their Heresy, Error,
Excesses which he may reform) Si enim, quantum ad ordinem pertinet Publicae
disciplinae, cognoscentes imperium tibi superna dispositione collatum, legibus
tuis ipsi quoque parent religionis Antistites, (he should have added with
Gratian Did. 10, 12. unless they thwart their Canons and profit) Ne vel in
rebus mundanis exclusae videantur obviare sententiae; quo (rogo) te decet
affectu eis obedire qui praerogandis venerabilibus sunt attributi Mysteris: (in
dispensing those mysteries only according to Gods word, not in unjust
Church Censures.) Proinde sicut non leve discrimen incumbii Pontificibus
siluisse pro divinitatis cultu quod congruit; ita his (quod absit) non mediocre
periculum est, qui cum parere debeant, defficiunt. (That is, when and where God
himself commands things in his word, not Popes and Prelates alone, enjoin
things different from, or not warranted by it:) Et cunctis generaliter
Sacerdotibus, recte divina tractantibus (this l^^^tation had been fit in, and
must be applied to all his precedent clauses, else, they are false and
heterodox) fidelium convenit corda submitii; quanto potius sedis illius
Praesuli consensus est adhibendus (here is the great Diana of the Ephesians)
quam cunctis Sacerdotibus et divinitas summa voluit praeminere (a gross
untruth warranted by no sacred Text, but contradicted by many) et subsequens
Ecclesiae generalis jugiter pietas celebravit? (another Papal forgery) Ubi
pietas tua evidenter advertit, Mat. 16.
nunquam quolibet (...) humano consilio el^vare se quemquam posse illius
privilegio, vel confession^ quem Christi vor praetulit universis, (a gross
untruth) quem Ecclesia veneranda semper confessa est, et habet devota primatem.
I peti possunt humanis praesumptionbus, quae^d vino sunt judicio constituta,
(but not by Popes, Bishops, and their Synods alone, the things then in
question) Vinci autem quorumlibet potestate non possunt, etc. Yet all these
Arguments would not persuade the Emperor Zeno, nor yet Anastatius to remove
either Timothy or Acacius from their Bishoprics, but they continued in them
till their deaths, as Hist. l. 16. c. 19. 2^.
Nicephorus informs us. I have inserted these Passages attributed to Pope
Gelasius, more largely, and discovered their falsehood and fallaciousnesse,
because the first I meet with of this kind (if as ancient as Gelasius) and much
insisted on in after ages by Popes and other Impugners of Emperors and Kings
Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions.

obtemperare et non reluctare, neque inobedientem esse quempiam Magistratui: Qui

Necessarium est igitur Magistratui subjici, non solum propter iram, Magistratui

Rhemigius Archbishop of Rhemes, Anno 494
in his Commentary in Epist. ad Romanos cap. 13. thus determines: Bibliotheca
Patrum, Tom. 5. pars 3. p. 851, 852.
Dixit Apostolus, Omnis anima, id est, Omnis homo, liber et servus, fidelis et
infidelis, (therefore the Pope and Prelates) Potestatibus sublimioribus
subditus sit. Omnis anima, dicit, pro eo quod, omnis homo, In sacra enim
Scriptura frequenter sola anima totum hominem significat. Potestatibus
sublimioribus dicit, Regibus, Principibus, Tribunis, Centurionibus, Dominis,
omnibusque Praelatis. Hoc and Petrus praecepit, Subjecti, inquiens, estote omni
humanae creaturae, id est, omnibus hominibus vobis praepositis, and hoc propter
Deum, sive propter amorem Dei, in quantum quippe homo non offendit Deum, etc.
Omnis potestas sive major, sive minor, quae hominibus praeest, aut ex voluntate
Dei, aut ex permissione Dei constituta est: Then rendering the reasons of Gods
instituting them, he concludes; Hac de causa omnipotens Deus bestialibus
hominibus Principes praeposuit, ut eorum terrore acerbitas animorum illorum
reprimeretur. Potestates super alios a Deo ordinatae sunt, sive quae sunt jura
potestatum a Deo constituta sunt; unde Dominus dicit Pilato, Non haberes
adversum me potestatem, nisi tibi data esset desuper: Hoc autem idcirco totum
prosequitur Apostolus, ut Potestatibus subditi sint, quia nonnulli ad fidem
venientes, pristinum obsequium and servitium, quasi libe^i effecti, Dominis et
Principibus nolebant reddere. Cum Dominus Jesus non venit conditiones mutare,
sed animas in aeternum victuras salvare. Dicebant etiam Romani credentes, qui
divinis legibus paremus, and Deo servimus non debemus servire, neque honorem
praebere Neroni, aliisque potestatibus terrenis (the language of Popes and the
Popish Clergy now even of Christian Emperors and Kings, whom they style
Profane, Lay, Heretical, worldly) Quapropter Apostolus talia scrpsit iis,
Poterat namque scandalum nasci Dominis et Principibus, si servi et subjecti
eorum Christiani effecti a servito illorum efficiantur alieni: noceret quoque
Ecclefiae dum permitterentur alii credere, cum magis meliores debeant Domini
servos suos recipere fideles Christi effectos: Hoc and ipsa veritas per semet
ipsum praecepit dicens Reddite quae sunt Caesaris; Caesari; and quae sunt Dei,

And in Epist. 1 Timothy c. 2. he writes, Vult pro Regibus fieri ^rationes and

quam formam, id est, exemplum omnis Ecclesia nunc ten^t (be the Kings good or
bad, Christians or Pagans, for sundry reasons which he prosecutes at large, and
thus abridgeth;) Orandum est pro salute and vita fidelium Regum and Principum,
ut longo tempore conservati pacem habeant Regna, ac magis proficiant in melius

Pope Symnachus being accused of Adultery and other horrid facts to Theodoricus
King of Italy, Anno 503, 504.
Sancta Synodus apud urbent Romanam ex praecepto Gloriosissimi Regis Theodorici
diversis ^^regionibus congregata in Christi nomine est (this King not the Pope
summoning this Council even in Rome it self.) Cum ex diversis Provinciis ad
urbem Romam convenire Sacerdotes Regia praecepisset authoritas, ut de his quae
de venerabili Papa Symmacho, Apostolici sedis praesul, ab adversariis ejus
dicebantur impingi, sanctum Concilium judicaret ^egitime; Liguriae, Aemiliae
vel Venetiarum Episcopis, consulendi Regem incubuit necessitas, concerning this
accusation: Who coming into the Kings presence respondit praefatus Rer
piissimus bonae conversationis affectu, plura ad se de Papae Symmachi actibus
horrenda fuisse perlata, et in Synodo oportere (si vera esset inimicorum ejus
objectio) judicatione constare. Whereupon the Examination of his crimes being
referred to this 4th. (some reckon it the 3d.) Synod held at Rome, (and that by
the Popes desire to purge himself, as well as by the Kings precept,) the Pope
entered into the Synod; et de evocatione Synodali ^lementissimo Regi gratias
retulit, et rem desiderii sui evenisse testatus est. Upon his accusation to the
King, he was suspended ab officio and beneficio, by this King; until he had
purged himself. At his first appearance before the Council, he complained of
this his suspension, as illegal, being not made by the Council, but out of it,
and prayed to be readmitted and restored by the Council; et ut omnia quae per
suggestiones inimicorum suorum (a part Cleri vel aliquibus laicis) amiserat,
potestati ejus legaliter ab honorabili Concilio redintegrarentur seu
redderenter, et tanti loci Praesul regulariter prius statui pristino
redderetur; et tunc, non ante veniret ad causam: et si ita, recte videretur,
accusantium propositionibus responderet. Digna res visa est maximo sacerdotum
numero, quae mereretur effectum, decernere tamen aliquid Synodus sine Regia
notitia non praesumpsit. Whereupon the Synod sent to the King to know his
pleasure herein; Sed suggestionibus per legatorum negligentiam non meruit
secundum vota responsum: (But contrary to the Synods desire and opinion) Iussus
est Regis praeceptionibus Papa Symmachus ante Patrimonii vel Ecclesiarum (quas
amiserat) receptionem, cum impugnatoribus suis in disceptatione confligere, qui
potestatis suae privilegia, et quae pro conscientiae (quantum just aestimamus)
emendatione submiserat, nec hac voluit vice resumere. Whereupon it was thought
meet that the Libel prepared against the Pope by his accusers, (qui quotidie
seditionibus appellabant) should be received by the Synod: Which being received
accordingly and read, there appeared two things in it which seemed either
false, or repugnant to their Ecclesiastical power: The one, that his Crimes
whereof he stood accused apud Regiam constitit notitiam, were pending before
the Kings own conusans; which was false, he having referred him to the Council:
The second, that they could prove him guilty of the Crimes objected by his
servants; addentes, ut ipse mancipia traderet, quibus (quantum illi
disserebant) posset in judicatione superari: Quae res Canonibus and ipsis
publicis erat legibus inimica, etc. Et dam inter ista quae essent facienda,
tractabatur, praefatus Papa, ut causam diceret occurrebat. Qui veniens,
abirruentibus turbis aemulorum suorum ita tractatus est, ut multis Presbyteris,
qui cum ipso erant, per cadem ipsam mortis fuisset occasio; quod probat
recentium adhuc vestigia vulnerum, nisi illustris vir Comes Alegerius, and
sublimes viri Gutela and Vedecelsus, Majores domus Regiae, perspexissent, quos
secum, unde egressus fuerat ad beati Petri Apostoli septa convexerat. Upon
these tumults and confusions, the Synod reported the whole series of their
proceedings to the King as Supreme Judge; iterum Nos ad Iustitiam contulimus
principalem, scientes vivinitare propitia regere Dominum, quem ad gubernacula
Ita^iae ipse providerat. They informed the King; Saepe nominatum Papam (post
caedem, cui subjacuerat cum suis) si voluntatem rursus haberet ereundi ad
judicium, fuisse commonitum; but that he could not canonically purge himself
without great dangers; and that by reason of the tumults of his accusers who
resisted justice, he could not be compelled to answer against his will. Ad haec
serenissimus Rex taliter (Deo adspirante) respondit, in Synodali esse arbitrio,
in tanto negotia sequenda praescribere, nec aliquid ad se praeter reverentiam
de Ecclesiasticis negotiis pertinere, committens etiam potestati Pontificum, ut
sive propositum vellent audire negotium, sive nollent, quod magis putarent
utile deliberarent, dummodo venerandi provisione Concilii par in Civitate
Romana Christianis omnibus redderetur. Whereupon the Synod by virtue of this
reference from the King, thought best to proceed no further in the examination
of the fact, but to refer the cause to Gods judgment, acquainting the Roman
Senate with their resolutions, and desiring them to consider, quanta
inconvenienter et praejudicialiter in hujus negotii principio contigissent;
That all men are sinners, and have need of Gods mercy, and that the examining
of this cause would do more prejudice and dishonor, then good to the Church.
Wherefore, juxta mandatum Principis non discuterent; but referr the whole cause
to God the Judge of secret things, and so acquitted him from the Platina,
Anastatius, Luitp^an^^^, Lydius, Sabellicus, in Symmacho 1.
Articles exhibited against him, as to men. Vnde secundum Principalia
praecepta, quae nostrae hoc tribuunt potestati, quicquid Ecclesiastici inter
sacram Vrbem Romae; vel foris Iuris est, reformamus, totamque causam Dei
judicio reservantes, universos hortamur ut sacram communionem (sicut res
postulat) ab eo percipiant, and Dei and animarum suarum meminerint; quia and
ipse amator pacis est, and ipse Pax est, qui monet, John ^4. Mat. 10.
Pacem meam do vobis, etc.

From these memorable proceedings against this Pope, it is most evident, 1.
That the Pope in this age was subject and submitted himself to the Judicature,
not only of the Emperor, but of Thedoricus the Gothish King of Italy, (who
removed Symmachus and Laurentius from the Papacy contending for it, and placed
Peter Altinat therein to appease the Schism, till the cause between them was
heard) and to a Council of Bishops, even for scandalous crimes objected against
him. 2ly. That the Power of summoning Councils even in Rome it self appertained
to this King of Italy, not to the Pope. 3ly. That the King upon the complaints
exhibited to him against the Pope, suspended him both from his temporalties,
benefices and Papal office by his Regal authority before the Council summoned,
till he had purged himself from the Crimes objected. 4ly. That though most of
the Synod held it just this Pope should not answer the Articles against him,
till he was first restored to his Patrimony, benefice and office, yet they
would determine nothing therein, till this Kings approbation, and pleasure
first known. 5ly. That the King would not take off this Popes Suspension, till
he answered his Articles, and purged himself, notwithstanding the Synods
request and opinion to the contrary. 6ly. That thereupon they received and read
the Articles against him. 7ly. That the Pope appeared by this Kings summons
before this Council to answer the crimes against him: where at his appearance,
he denies to answer in point of Law, till his Suspension first released, and
his restitution: which the Emperor overruled against him. After which he
appeared the second time upon Summons to answer the Articles, and purge
himself; but was interrupted by the tumultuous force and assaults of his
accusers, made upon him and his followers, who were wounded, and had been slain
by them, had not the Kings Great Officers rescued them from their fury, and
guarded them back to their lodgings: That after this upon new Summons, the Pope
was willing to answer, and purge himself before the Synod, but that he was
informed, he could not do it without danger of being slain by his tumultuous
opposites. 8ly. That the Synod thereupon repaired to the King, as the Supreme
Judge, to direct them how to proceed in this cause, by reason of these Tumults.
9ly. That thereupon the King referred the whole business to them, to proceed
therein as they should think best for the Peace of the Church, and of all
Christians in the City of Rome. 10ly. That they hereupon by virtue of this
Kings regal authority and command, (not their own inherent Episcopal or Synodal
Jurisdiction) referred the merits of the cause, being secret and difficult, to
Gods judgment, and restored the Pope to his Ecclesiastical Rights and exercise
of his Ministry within the City of Rome; and persuaded an amicable Christian
peace and agreement between him, his adversaries, the Senate and Citizens of
Rome: Where then is that transcendent Jurisdiction of Popes over Kings,
Councils, all other Bishops, and his absolute exemption from their Judicatures
for any scandalous sins or heresies, which succeeding Popes and their Parasites
boast of, in the Her^, p. 36, to 40.
premised Chapters? To evade this undeniable president, Apologia pro Symmacho,

Ennodius, and other flatterers of Popes, pretend, That Pope Symmachus out of
mere humility, and of his own accord, submitted himself to this Kings and
Councils Judgment. But the premises evidence the contrary, that most of these
proceedings (especially his Suspension, overruling of his demurrer, etc.) were
much against his will; and that he had no real desire to purge himself, what
ever he pretended: And John Gerson Chancellor of Paris (one of the learnedest,
profoundest Pontificians) in his notable Book De Auferibilitate Papae, De
Consideratio, c. 2.
resolves; That Symmachus, and other Popes did undergo the judgments of
Councils, nequaquam ex humili condescentione, sicut nonnulli fingunt, sed ex
debito et obligatione. Yea this Pope himself in his Tom. 3. Bibl. Patrum.
Apology to Anastatius the Emperor, styles him Principem rerum humanarum:
adding, Thou, O Emperor; governest human and secular affairs, Bishops dispense
the divine Mysteries; without any addition, that Bishops govern all
Ecclesiastical affairs, which this King and the Emperor then did in Italy, not
Popes nor Bishops.

Hormisda the 1. having condemned the Eutychians in a Council at Rome, Anno 516
by the exhortation and command of King Theodoricus, by his Letters and
Messengers exhorted John then Patriarch of Constantinople, and Anastatius the
Emperor, to renounce this Heresy, and believe the two natures in Christ. But
they taking this message in high indignation and scorn, put the messengers into
an old leaking Ship, and Anastatius commanded them to return directly into
Italy, and not to touch upon the shore of Greece, enjoining them to return this
answer to the Pope; Scire se Augustorum (or Imperatoris) proprium esse, non
Pontificis imperare; nec Imperata Pontificis accpiere: et si quid foret, in quo
hunc, cui divina curae sunt, jubere oporteat, se eum esse, a quo alii multo
melius sua jussa expectent, quam sua proponant exequenda. Nos jubere volumus,
non Nobis juberi.

Christian faith, and Peace of the Church by establishing the Orthodox faith,
and suppressing heresies by his Imperial authority, the principal cause of Gods
advancing him to the Empire. In pursuance whereof this Emperor Justinus by his
Letters and Decrees endeavored to reconcile the differences between the
Bishops, Churches of Rome and Constantinople; ut unitatem individuae Trinitatis
ipsi quoque colant in unitate mentium. Quid enim gratius reperiri potest, quid
justius, quid illustrius, quam quos idem Regnum continet, idemque fidei cultus
irradiat, eos non diversa contendere, sed collectis in eisdem sensibus
instituta venerari, non humana mente illata, sed in divinae providentiae
spiritu. This Pope in his Epistle to Epiphanius Bishop of Constantinople, has
this memorable passage, Surius Tom. 2. p. 366, 369 370.
Hinc enim supernae misericordiae documentum perdocetur, quoniam et mundeni
Principes causas fidei, cum reipublicae ordinatione conjungunt, as a principal
part of their care, and best means of their safety and prosperity in all their
secular affairs. And he, with all the Bishops, Clergy, Abbots, Inhabitants of
Jerusalem, Antioch, and Syria, exlubited a joint Supplicatio and Confession of
their faith, Deo amabili et piissimo Imperatori ex Deo Augusto et Principi
Iustino Christianissimo sollicitudinem de perfecta unione, sanctarum
Ecclesiarum habere debere, ut unitas, quae cum Dei facta fuerit juvamine, nulla
deinceps rationabili aut irrationabili occasionis fomite inquietari possit; who
thereupon banished the Arrians disturbing the Churches peace.

banished again: upon which occasion he writ thus of Emperors and Kings
Supremacy, duty, trust, in and toward the Church of God, Clementissimus quoque

praevaricantibus inferamus. Sanctissimi siquidem Patriarchae uniuscujusque
Diocesis haec proponant in Ecclesiis sub se constitutis, et manifesta faciant
quae a nobis constituta sunt. Illi quoque rursus etiam ipsi proponant in
Metropolita sanctissima Ecclesia et constitutis sub se Episcopis haec manifesta
faciant, illorum vero singuli in propria Ecclesia haec proponant; ut nullus
nostrae Reipublicae ignoret quae a Nobis ad honorem et ad augmentum magni Dei

Copies of these Laws to be sent to all Metropolitans; and Johanni vero

necessarium duximus patriam legum fontem Sacerdotii speciali nostri numinis

usque ad Oceanum fretum positae sunt, saluberrimae legis vigor extendat, et sit

Ecclesias nostras (not vestras) sive nunc pertinentes, seu postea eis

aeternitas ad omnipotentis Dei honorem venerandae sedi summi Apostoli Petri
dedicavit, hoc habeant omnes terrae, omnes Insulae totius occidentis quae usque
ad ipsas Oceani recessus extendantur nostri Imperii; providentiam prae hoc in
aeternum reminiscentes hujus legis praerogativam non solum in occidentalibus
partibus Romanae Ecclesiae condonamus, sed etiam in Orientalibus partibus, in
quibus Ecclesiasticae Vrbis Romae possessiones sunt, vel postea fuerint:
scilicet, omnibus judicibus minoribus et majoribus qui Christiani Orthodoxi
sunt, vel postea fuerint, hanc nostram constitutionem servantibus. Nihilominus
hujusmodi Legis temeratoribus post coelestes poenas, etiam legitimam super
vigorem pertimescentibus, poenam quinquaginta librarum auri formidantibus; hac

Bilisario Proconsule. This Law the Emperor sent to Pope John the 3d. with this
inscription, Joanni viro beato and sancto, Archiepiscopo and Patriarchae
Veteris Romae: which being an Universal Law extending to all parts of the Roman
Empire; to the possession of all Churches, to Isles in the East and West, as
well as those of Rome, equally binding Popes and the Church of Rome, as all
others; and made by the Emperors own inherent Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction,
(without the Pope) as the sole Original fountain of Laws, to whom the chief
Pontifical, Legislative power appertained; Compared with his precedent Laws
binding both Popes, Patriarchs, Metropolitans, Bishops, Priests, all sorts of
Ecclesiastical or religious persons, and subjecting them to punishments of
deprivation, imprisonment, and other censures to be inflicted on them by the
Emperor himself, and by his temporal Officers, Judges, who were to inquire and
inform him of all violations of them, are pregnant evidences of this Pious
Emperors Legislative, Coercive, Supreme Ecclesiastical authority, (transmitted
in Perpetuity by these Laws to the Roman Empire, and his Successors therein)
and most perspicuously demonstrate, that it was a principal part of his
Imperial office, duty, care, to make such Ecclesiastical Laws, for the
conservation of Gods sacred faith, worship, Laws, and good Government of the
Church, Clergy, as well as Laws for the Government of the Commonwealth. 6ly. By

5. General Council of Constantinople upon the death of Pope Agapetus used these
words to Justinian; Transtulit ipsum Dominus, ut plenitudinem directionis
vestrae custodiret Serenitati. 7ly. By declaring, That if any Bishop by
Doctrine or otherwise move any tumults, he shall be punished by my hand, for my
hand is the hand of Gods Minister. Si Civibus leges, quam potestatem nobis Deus
pro sua in homines benignitate credidit, firmas in omnibus custodiri ad
obedientium securitatem studemus; Quanto plus studi^ adhibere debemus circa
sacrorum Canonum, et divinarum Legum custodiam? He reputing this the principal
part of his Imperial office, trust, care, and greatest security. 8ly. Anno 550.
His Supreme Ecclesiastical Power was evidenced by summoning Synods, Councils,
and presiding in them; Ecclesiasticae, Hist. l. 17. c. 27
Nicephorus Callistus records, Imperator Justinianus, sanctam quintam Synodum
Oecumenicam, Episcopis Ecclesiarum omnium evocatis, coegit. And himself in his
Letters of Summons issued for convening the 5. General Council of
Constantinople (recorded by Council. Tom. 2. p. 494, 495 496.
Laurentius Surius, Binius and Crab in their Collections of Councils) thus
relates the summoning of all the former General Councils, and confirmation of
their Decrees by all Christian Emperors his predecessots, which occasioned him
to summon this 5. General Council by his Edict.

In Nomine Domini Dei nostri Jesu Christi, Imperator Caesar Flavius
Justinianus, etc. Beatissimis Episcopis and Patriarchis, etc. Semper studium
fuit orthodoxis et piis Imperatoribus patribus nostris pro tempore exortas
haereses per Congregationem religiosissimorum Episcoporum amputare, et recta
fide sincere praedicata in pace sanctam Dei Ecclesiam custodire. Quapropter and
Constantinus Prae recordationis, Arrio blasphemante and dicente non esse Filium
consubstantialem Deo Patri, sed creaturam, and ex non extantibus factum esse,
congregavit Niceae ex diversis Diocesibus trecentos December et Octo sanctos
patres; et cum ipse etiam Concilio interfuisset, et adjuvisset eos quod
Consubstantialem filium Patri confessi sunt, condemnata Arriana impietate,
studium habuit rectam fidem obtinere. Exposito itaque Sancto Symbolo vel
Mathemate fidei, per hoc Sancti Patres confessi sunt, consubstantialem esse
Filium Deo Patri, quod usque tunc apud plurimos dubitabatur. Sed et Theodosius
senior piae recordationis, Macedonio negante Deitatem sancti Spiritus, et
Apollinario vel Magno ejus Discipulo, in Dispensatione incarnati Dei verbi
blasphemantibus, and dicentibus sensum humanum, non recipisse Deum verbum, sed
Carni unitum esse animam irrationabilem habenti; congregatis in regia Vrbe
Centum Quinquaginta Sanctis Patribus, cum et ipse particeps fuisset Concilii,
damnatis praedictis Haereticis, una cum impiis eorum dogmatibus, fecit rectam
praedicare fidem. Secuti enim iidem Sancti Patres expositam rectam fidem a
trecentis December et Octo sanctis Patribus explanaverunt de Deitate sancti
Spiritus, et perfect de dispensatione incarnati Dei verbi docuerunt. Iterum
Nesto^o Impio alium dicente Deum verbum, and alium Christum, and huncquidem
natura felium Dei Patris, illum autem gratia filium in pie introducente, and
sanctam Gloriosam semper Virginem Dei Genitricem esse negante, cum pene omnes
Orientales parts sua impietate adimplesset idem Nestorius, Theodosius junior
piae recordationis congregavit priorem Ephesinam sanctam Synodum, cui
praesidebant Coelestinus, et Cyrillus Sancti Patres, and directis Iudicibus qui
deberent Concilio interesse, compulit et ipsum Nestorium ibi pervenire, et
Iudicium propter eum procedere, et tali examinatione facta, secuti iidem sancti
Patres per omnia ea quae de Fide definita sunt ab anterioribus sanctis Patribus
condemnaverunt Nestorium, una cum ejus impietate. His ita subsecutis, cum
insurrexissent contra Cyrillum sequaces Nestorii impii, fes^inaverunt (quantum
in ipsis fuit) refutare condemnationem contra Nestorium factam: sed praedictus
piae recordationis Theodosius, Vindicans ea quae ita recte contra Nestorium et
ejus impietatem fuerant iudicata, fecit firmiter obtinere contra eum factam
condemnationem. Et post haec iterum cum Eutichius demens emersisset, negando
consubstantialem nobis esse carnem Domini, multis interea motis, tam
Constantinopoli, quam Ephesi, tanta pro illa facta est Haereticorum
circumventio, ut etiam ejiceretur propter eum Flavianus Religiosae memoriae
Regiae Vrbis Episcopus. Nota.
Piae autem recordationis Martianus congregavit Chalcedone sanctos Patres, et
Magna contentione inter Episcopos facta, non solum per suos Iudices, sed etiam
per seipsum in Concilium pervenit, et ad concordiam omnes perdurit. Cui sancti
Patres in omnibus secuti ea quae pro fide definita sunt apraedictis tribus
sanctis Conciliis, et quae judicata sunt de Haereticorum damnatione et
impietate eorum, damnaverunt et anathematizaverunt Eutichen dementem, et impia
ejus dogmata, necnon et Nestorium cum impiis ejus dogmatibus, quoniam tunc
festinaverunt quidam defendere Nestorium et impia ejus dogmata. Super haec
autem iidem in Chalcedone sancti Patres anathematizaverunt eos qui aliud
Symbolum tradiderunt aut tradunt, praeter hoc quod expositum est a trecentis
december et octo sanctis Patribus, et explanatum a Centum quinquaginta sanctis
Patribus. His itaque omnibus, per diversa tempora subsecutis praedicti piae
recordationis nostri Patres ea quae in Vnoquoque Concilio judicata sunt Legibus
suis corroboraverunt et confirmaverunt, Nota.
et Haereticos qui definitionibus praedictorum sanctorum quatuor Conciliorum
resistere, et Ecclesias conturbare conati sunt, expulerunt. Defuncto autem

Chalcedonensi sancto Concilio. Leo piae recordationis ad omnes ubique
Sacerdotes scripsit, ut unusquisque eorum propriam sententiam manifestaret de
eodem Sancto Concilio, and cum alius alium Episcopum non expectasset, ad hoc
quod interrogati sunt responderunt. Exiguo autem tempore transacto iterum
insurrexerunt Nestorii and Eutichis sequaces and tantas turbas in sanctis Dei
Ecclesiis fecerunt, ut divisiones, and schismata in eis fierent, and nullam
communionem adse invicem Ecclesiae haberent. Nec enim praesumebat aliquis de
Civitate ad Civitatem veniens communicare, nec Clericus ex alia Civitate in
aliam Civitatem veniens in Ecclesiam procedere. Cum autem secundum suam
Misericordiam Dominus Deus Reipublicae Gubernationem nobis credivit, initium et
fundamentum nostri Imperii fecimus, conjungere divisos Sacerdotes sanctarum Dei
Ecclesiarum, ab Orient usque ad Occidentem, et omnem contentionem amputantes
quae contra Chalcedonensem sanctam Synodum ab Eutychis et Nestorii impiorum
sequacibus movebatur, fecimus praedicare eandem sanctam Synodum, cum praedictis
aliis sanctis tribus Conciliis in Dei Ecclesiis, certe scientes, quod ea quae
ab ea de fide exposita sunt, consonant per omnia aliis tribus sanctis
Conciliis, et multis quidem ad eandem sanctam Synodum contradicentibus
satisfecimus, alios aut qui perseveraverunt eidem sancto Concilio
contradicentes extulimus a sanctis Dei Ecclesiis et Venerabilibus Monasteriis,
ut concordia et pace sanctarum Ecclesiarum et earum Sacerdotum firmiter
custodita, una et eadem fides quam sanctae quatuor Synodi confessae sunt, in
sanctis Dei Ecclesiis praedicetur. His ita pro firmitate sanctarum quatuor
Synodorum Deo propitio per nos factis et obtinentibus in sancta Dei Ecclesia,
Nestorii sequaces propriam impietatem applicare volentes sanctae Dei Ecclesiae,
et non potentes hoc per Nestorium facere, festinaverunt ea introducere per
Theodorum Mopsuestenum Doctorem Nestorii, qui multo pejora Nestorio
blasphemavit, et super alias innumerabiles suas Blasphemias, contra Christum
Deum nostrum factas, alium dixit Deum verbum, alium Christum, nec non et per
impia conscripta Theodori quae contra rectam fidem et Ephesinam primam sanctam
Synodum, et contra sanctae memoriae Cyrillum et duodecim ejus capitula
exposuit, et insuper sceleratam Epistolam, quam dicitur Ibas ad Marim Persam
scripsisse, quae plena est omni impietate Theodori et Nestorii. Per hanc etenim
impiam Epistolam non solum impietatem, sed etiam ipsas personas Theodori and
Nestorii, quas maxim laudat and judicat, eadem impia Epistola festinaverunt
condemnationem liberare, dicentes eam susceptam esse a Sancta Chalcedonensi
Synodo. Hoc autem dicunt non pro defensione sanctae Synodi sed nomine ejus
sicut putant, suam impietatem confirmare festinantes. Certum autem est, quod
impia intentio est ista vindicantium, ut si eis evenerit, non praedicetur Deus
verbum homo factus esse, nec sancta Gloriosa semper Virgo Maria Dei Genitrix
praedicetur. Haec enim Theodorus and Nestorius in suis Conscriptis impie
exposuerunt, and qui Epistolam scripsit, in eablasphemat. Nos igitur sequentes
sanctos Patres, et volentes rectam fidem sine quadam macula in Dei Ecclesiis
praedicari, et impiorum conatum resecare, primum quidem et in vestris vos
degentes Ecclesiis interrogavimus de praedictis tribus capitulis, et vestram
nobis voluntatem manifestam fecistis, pro qua et comprobavimus vos, quod
indubitanter et cum omni alacritate rectam fidem confessi estis, et impiam
condemnastis. Quoniam vero et post condemnationem a vobis factam in eisdem
ipsis permanent quidam eadem impia tria Capitula vindicantes, ideo vocavimus
vos ad regiam Vrbem, hortantes, communiter convenientes, quam habetis pro his
voluntatem, iterum manifestare, etc. Adhortamur igitur etiam vos de his
disceptare: Scire etenim vos volumus, quod nos ea quae a Sanctis quatuor
Conciliis, Niceno, Constantinopolitano, Ephesino primo, et Chalcedonensi de una
eademque fide exposita et definita sunt, et de Ecclesiastico statu regulariter
disposita, servabimus et defendemus, et ea sequimur, et omnia quae consonant
istis suscipimus et amplectimur. Quicquid autem non consonat istis, vel a
quacunque persona scriptum inveniatur contra ea quae de una eademque fide a
sanctis quatuor Conciliis, vel uno ex his, definita sunt, hoc tanquam alienum,
omnino pietatis execramur; sequimur autem in omnibus sanctos patres et Doctores
sanctae Dei Ecclesiae, id est, Athanasium, Hilarium, Basilium, Gregorium
Theologum, and Gregorium Nyssenum, Ambrosium, Theophilum, Johann.
(Chrysostomum) Constantinopolitanum, Cyrillum, Augustinum, Proculum, Leonem,
and omnia quae ab his de fide recta, and ad condemnationem Haereticorum
conscripta and exposita sunt, suscipimus, etc. After which he prescribes the
Bishops what points they should debate in this General Council, and then
concludes; Omnia igitur praedicta cum omni subtilitate disceptantes, sicut
Sacerdotes decet, in mente habentes Dei timorem, and futurum judicium, and
nihil pietati and rectae fidei and veritati, and Dei gloriae and honori
praeponentes, in mente autem habentes et Apostolicam pronuntiationem quae
contra eos qui contraria rectae fidei tradunt prolata est, manifest dicentem,
Gal: 1. 8, 9.
quod licet Nos vel Angelus de Coelo evangelizaverit vobis praeterquam quod
evangelizavimus vobis, anathema sit, scientes autem and Petri Apostoli
praeceptum dicentis, 1 Pet. 3. 15
Parati semper estote ad satisfactionem omni petenti vos rationem de spe quae
in vobis est, celeriter de his quae interrogavimus vestram manifestate
voluntatem. Cum enim qui de recta fide interrogatur diu protrahit, nihil aliud
est nist abnegatio rectae confessionis.

In this Council the Emperor appointed some of his Surius, Tom: 2. p. 501, 502.
Nobles and Judges to be presidents, to take an account of, and direct the
Bishops in their proceedings: who after Pope Vigilius his refusal to appear in
the Council; Gloriosissimi Iudices dixerunt, Nos quidem hoc quod jussi sumus a
piissimo Imperatore implevimus, and imus ad ejus palatium in ejus obsequium
permansuri; vos autem Dei timorem prae oculis habentes celerem finem imponere
causae dignamini, convenientem his quae a sanctis quatuor Conciliis de fide
recta definita sunt, scientes quod piissimus Imperator specialiter jussit nobis
dicere vestrae Sanctitati, quod ipse quae a sanctis quatuor Conciliis de una
eademque fide definita et judicata sunt, et servavit, et servat, et vindicavit,
et vindicat, et omnia quidem quae convenient his quae ab iisdem Sanctis
Conciliis pro recta fide definita sunt, et suscipit et servat; omnia autem
contraria his quae ab ipsis de fide recta judicata sunt, et rejicit, et aliena
de Ecclesia judicat esse.

This most godly Emperor particularly summoned Surius, Tom: 2. p. 496, 498,
349, 501, 502, etc. Dr. Crakenthorps Vigilius Dormitans, cap. 2, 3.
Pope Vigilius (of whose orthodoxy he doubted) to this Council, both by
himself, by his Judges presiding in it, and by Deputies sent to him from the
Council; who frequently admonished him, et proposuerunt iussionem piissimi
Imperatoris Papae, ut una cum omnibus conveniret, to debate with the Council,
and conclude the 3. Chapters; who yet (as the Council attests, and De
Conciliis, l. 1. c. 4. 36.
Bellarmin, and Annal. Eccles. Ann. 553. nu. 29, 31.
Baronius confess,) Neque per se, neque per Legatos interfuit, sed noluit
interesse; (though then at Constantinople) whereupon this General Council was
held and proceeded without him. Nec enim justum est tam Christianissimum
Imperatorem vel fidelem populum scandalizare ex dilatione ejus, upon pretense,
that there were many Eastern Bishops there, pauci vero cum eo: facere autem per
semetipsum in scriptis suam sententiam, and offerre piissimo Domino (so he
styled Justinian) Ideo enim and inducias postulasse ab ejus Serenitate, ut
intra eas suam manifestaret sententiam. During the Councils Sessions, Pope
Vigilius published his Apostolical Constitution, and definitive sentence in
defense of the Three Chapters: Which Constitution and sentence of his, this
General Council contradicted, anathematised even in the cause of faith,
censuring his definitive opinion as heretical; condemning the Catholic faith,
and justifying the heresy of Nestorius, as De Pontif: Romans l. 4. c. 10. Dr
Crakenthorps Vigilius Dormitans, c. 2. 3, 4.
Bellarmin himself confesses: All the godly Bishops in the cloze of the 6.
Collation cried out unanimously; Surius, Tom: 2. p. 579.
Multis Annis Imperatorem, orthodoxum Imperatorem multis annis. And in the
Conclusion of the 7. Session or Collation they all give him this Encomium:

Sancta Synodus dixit, Evidenter et nunc Deum placans intentio piissimi et
tranquillissimi Imperatoris ostensa est, qui omnia semper fecit, et facit quae
sanctam Ecclesiam et recta dogmata conservant, qui et modo recitatas Chartas
direxit manifestantes et ipsas, quod nec latuit aliquem alienam ab initio esse
istorum Capitulorum impietatis sanctam Dei Ecclesiam. Et Christianissimus

multiplicare solet: nos autem Orationes quotidianas facientes pro ejus
Serenitate, pro tribus Capitulis altero die adjuvante Deo Synodicam sententiam
proferemus. This Emperor ratifying the definitions of this Council by his royal
assent and Decrees, Surius Council: Tom. 2. p. 387, to 400
afterward writ a Confession of his own faith; wherein he refutes and
anathematizeth all Heresies condemned by former Councils, in nature of an
Imperial Decree, which he enjoined to be observed within his Empire, sending it
to Pope John the 2d. and approved by Pope Agatho his Successor, printed in
Surius with this Title; Edictum Piissimi Imperatoris Justiniani, fidei
Confessionem continens, and refutationem haereseos quae adversantur Catholicae
Ecclesiae, etc. With this Note in the Margin; Confessio Justiniani Imperatoris,
Erudito, Pio, et Catholico Imperatore digna. The ground of his compiling and
publishing it, is thus expressed in the Prologue: Scientes quod nihil aliud sic
potest misericordem Deum placare, quam ut omnes Christiani unum idemque sapiant
in recta and immaculata fide, nec sint dissentiones in sancta Dei Ecclesia;
necessarium putavimus, etc. to compile and publish this his Edict and
Confession of Faith for these ends. Upon reading whereof Surius Tom. 2 p. 399.
Pontianus, a Bishop, writ thus to him. Exultat autem spiritus noster hoc
firmiter te piissime esse Imperator, quod Apostolica fides praedicat,
credentes: quod a rectae credulitatis tramite non declines. Talem enim decet
esse Imperatorem pium, justum, fidelem, qualem te nos esse cognovimus. Yet

Baronius is so much enraged against this godly Emperor for his proceedings
against Pope Silverius, and Vigilius, and for his Ecclesiastical Laws, that
like another Hercules furens he most unchristianly belyes, slanders, reviles,

tyrannical, presumptuous, heretical wretch that ever breathed; What? Christian
Princes, such a one as Justinian to make Laws for Popes, or Bishops? Laws
concerning faith, etc. who should receive all such Laws from, and only obey
the Laws made by Popes and Prelates. Vides quanta iactura cum Principes

meddling in sacred affairs, but for a perverse madman, an Antichrist, setting
up his chair, throne, in the temple of God, and exalting himself above all that

Edicts for heresy, And that when he died ad supplicia apud infernos luenda

37. Stately Churches in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and other great
Cities, besides many Abbeys, Churches, Hospitals; so that Nulla satietas

with great Ornaments, public and private houses, goodly walls, sumptuous
buildings and Churches, ut nihil esse posset magnificentius. Which yet were
nothing comparable to his most wholesome Imperial Laws, (abridged, corrected,
supplied by his learned care and diligence) whereby he governed both the Empire
and Church. 16ly. His memory was so famous, for Piety, Zeal, Justice, Wisdom,

17ly. Learned Vigilius Dormitans chapter 20. p. 355.
Dr. Crakenthorp gives this testimony of him; There cannot be found in all
Scripture more fair evidence, nor a more authentic Charter for the happy
estate of any one in particular, that lived since the Apostles times, then is
for this Justinian; For what were the works which did accompany and follow him?
Truly the works of sincere faith, of fervent zeal to God, of love to the Church
and children of God, the works of piety, of prudence, of justice, of fortitude,
of munificence, of many other heroical virtues; with these, as with a garment
and chain of pure gold, Justinian being decked, was brought unto the
bridegroom. Every Decree made or ratified by him for confirming the truth;
every Anathema against Heresies and heretics, particularly those against
Vigilius, and all that defend him (that is, against Baronius, and all that
defend the Popes infallibility in defining matters of faith;) every Temple or
Church, every Monastery and Hospital, every City and Town, every Bridge, Haven,
and Highway, every Castle, Fort and Munition, whether made or repaired by him,
tending either immediately to the advancing of Gods service in strengthening
the Empire against his and Gods enemies; Every Book in the Digest, Code, and
Authenticks; every Title, yea every Law in every Title whereby the Christian
faith or Religion, or preaceable order and tranquillity have been either
planted or propagated, or continued in the Church, or Commonwealth; all these
and every one of them, and many other the like, which I cannot either remember
or recount, are like so many Rubies, Chrysolites and Diamonds in the costly
Garment, or so many links in the golden chain of his faith and virtues; Seeing
they who offer but one mite into the Treasury of the Lord; or, give but one cup
of cold water to a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall not want a reward; O
what a weight of eternity and glory, shall that Troop of Virtues and Train of
Good works obtain at his hands, who rewards indeed every man according to
their works; but withal rewards them infinitely above all the dignity or
condignity of their works?

I have the longer insisted in clearing Justinians Ecclesiastical Supremacy in
matters of faith, worship, over all Ecclesiastical persons, and Popes
themselves, with his piety as well as Regality in making, collecting the
forecited Ecclesiastical Laws; because they are most punctual to my present
Theme, and most oppugned by Baronius.

Agapetus a famous learned Deacon of Constantinople, in his Admonitorium to the
Emperor Justinian, Anno 550.
has these memorable passages, Honor quolibet sublimiorem quanto habeas
dignitatem, Ad Justinianum Imp. jam Coronatum Paraenetica Oration, Bibl. Patrum,
Tom: 6. pars 1. p. 565, 566.
O Imperator, honora supra omnes, qui hoc te dignatus est, Deum, quoniam juxta
similitudinem caelestis Regni tradidit tibi sceptrum terrenae potestatis, ut
homines doceas justi custodiam. Super omnia praeclara quae regnum habet,
pietatis cultusque divini corona regem exornat. Sceptrum Imperii quam a Deo
susceperis cogitato quibusnam modis placebis ei qui id tibi dedit; quumque
omnibus hominibus ab eo sis praelatus (therefore above the Pope, and all other
Prelates) magis omnibus eum honestare festina: porro id ipse honestamentum
arbitratur maximum, si quasi te factos a se tuearis, atque ut debiti solutionem
benefaciendi munus adimpleas, etc. And he positively asserts; Essentia corporis
aequalis cuilibet homini Imperator, potestate autem dignitatis cunctorum
praesidi Deo, nec enim habet in terris se quenquam altiorem: oportet igitur
ipsum ut Deum, non irasci, ut mortalem non efferri etc. His Imperator non habet
in terris se quenquam altiorem, making much against the Popes Supremacy,
recited by Antonius Abbas (in his Melissa,) the Roman Censurers in their Index
Expurgatorius, Romae excus: Anno 1607. p. 200. and the Spanish Inquisitors in
their Index librorum prohibitorum and expurgand. excus. Madreti, Anno 1612. in
Agapeto, p. 797. not deeming it expedient totally to expunge it, are contented
to yield the Emperors Supremacy in Temporals, by adding this exposition of them
in the Margin of future Impressions; Intellige de Potestate politica and
seculari: (enough to subvert the Popes Secular Monarchy, asserted by them and
their flatteres) when as Agapetus meant it of his Supremacy in Spirituals as
well as Temporals, as his precedent and subsequent words assure us, against
this false new marginal Gloss. He adds, Imperator ut est omnium Dominus,
(therefore the Popes) ita cum omnibus Dei servus existat: his whole
Admonitorium tends to prove, that the advancement of Piety, Religion, and Gods
Worship, is and ought to be all Kings, Emperors chiefest study, care, as well
as honor and safety. Anno 5^^.

cause, because he would not seem to cross the Canons: whereupon a Synod being
called at Paris, Gregorius Turonensis Episcopus (though a great favourer of
Pretextatus,) thus ingenuously professed and told the King: Si quis de nobis
(Episcopis) O Rex Justitiae tramitem transcendere voluerit, a te corrigi
potest; but if you transgress them, who shall punish you? We speak unto you:
If you be willing, you obey; but if you be unwilling, who can condemn you, but
he only who has pronounced that he is just? Not the Pope, nor a whole Synod of
Bishops, as this Bishop confesses. Pretextatus being convicted of the crimes
by his own confession, was thereupon apprehended, imprisoned, and afterward
banished by this King, but recalled and restored by King Gunthram his Successor.

This King Gunthram summoned a Synod at Lions against Salonius Ebredunensis
Episcopus, Anno ^^^.

who being complained against for drunkenness, whoredom, and other crimes, and
convicted thereof, were deprived of their Bishoprics, and thrust into a
Monastery as Prisoners by the King for a time. Afterward, complaining to the
King that they were unjustly injured by the Synod, they petitioned him, sibi
tribui licentiam ut ad Papam urbis Romae accedere debeant. Whereupon Rex
annuens petitionibus eorum, datis Epistolis, eos abire permisit. When they came
to Rome, and comp^^ined to Pope John of their misery and unjust removal, he
writ to the King, desiring him to restore them; which he did. After which they
falling into new crimes by bearing arms, murdering and oppressing their
Citizens, reviling the King and his mother, drinking and whoring day and night,
were again removed by the King from their Bishoprics, Anno 589.
and thrust into the Monastery of Marcellus. Surius Council. Tom 2. p. 68^.

This King the next year summoned another Synod in urbe Valentina, which met,
juxta imperium Domini Gunthrami Regis, pro diversis pauperum querimoniis, etc.
Et quia praedictus Rex per virum illustrem Asclepeiadorum referendarium, datis
ad Sanctam Synodum Epistolis injunxit, to subscribe what ever he, his Queen,
and daughters had given to holy places; they thereupon accordingly subscribed.

Gunthramus Rex Francorum issued this memorable Precept, De observando die
Dominico to the Bishops summoned by him to the second Council of Matiscon, and
omnibus Pontificibus and universis Clericis, and cunctis Judicibus in regione
nostra cons^itutis, beginning thus; Per hoc supernae Majestatis authorem (cujus
universa reguntur Imperio) placari credimus, si in populo nostro justitiae
jura, and praeceptorum divinorum monita servamus. Dum ergo pro Regni nostri
stabilitate, and salvatione Populi, solicitudine pervigili attentius
pertractavimus, agnovimus infra regni nostri spatia universa scelera, quae
canonibus et legibus pro divino timore puniri consuerunt, suadente adversario
boni operis, perpetrari (to the drawing down of Gods judgments on them;) which
sins he thereupon enjoynes the Bishops and Ministers to endeavor to
suppress by their Preaching and Holy Lives; Mark ^^.
Nam nec nos, quibus facultatem regnandi superni Regis commisit authoritas iram
eius evadere possumus, si de subiecto populo solicitudinem non habemus: Idcirco
hujus Decreti ac definitionis generalis vigore decernimus ut in omnibus diebus
Dominicis, in quibus sanctae resurrections mysterium veneramur, quando ex more
ad veneranda templorum oracula universae plebis connectio devotionis
congregatur studio, praeter quod victum praeparari convenit, ab omni corporali
opere suspendantur: enjoining all Bishops and Priests thereon, constanti
praedicatione populi universam multitudinem corrigere, etc. And the Judges to
punish them according to Law; Concluding, Cuncta ergo, quae hujus Edicti tenore
decrevimus perpetualiter volumus custodiri, quia in sancta Synoda Matisconensi,
haec omnia sicut nostis, studuimus diffiniri, quae praesenti authoritate
vulgamus, wherein were 20. Canons made, (the first, for the strict observation
of the Lords day) which he ratifyed by this Royal Edict. All the Bishops in
this Council concluded, Propterea inde^inenter omnes nos orare oportet, ut Dei
omnipotentis Majestas, and Regis nostri incolumitatem solita pietate conservet,
and nos omnes illa operari concedat, quae Serenitati ac Ma^estati ejus rite
complaceant: instead of quarrelling at his zeal for religion, Gods worship, and
regal care of his own and his Subjects salvation, for whom he was to give an
account to God, who had constituted him their King.

Regnante gloriosissimo atque piissimo and Deo fidelissimo Domino Reccaredo
Rege; cum idem gloriosissimus Princeps omnes regiminis sui Pontifices in unum
convenire mandasset in Civitate Regia Toletana; (the Metropolis of Spain;) this
pious King sitting in the midst of this Council (where 72 Bishops assembled)
made an Oration to them, so soon as they were sat, showing the reasons of its
summons, wherein are these remarkable passages, evidencing the supreme care of
the orthodox faith, religion, and peoples souls, to reside in Kings; and that
himself was the instrument raised by God to convert the Goths and Swedes to
the Orthodox faith, a Summary whereof he had drawn up, and tendered to this
Council to be read, professed, and ratified throughout his Kingdom for the
future. Non credimus vestram latere sanctitatem quanto tempore in errore
Arrianorum, laborasset Hispania, and non multos post decessum genitoris nostri
dies, quibus nos vestra beatitudo fidei sanctae Catholicae cognovit esse
sociatos, credimus generaliter magnum et aeternum gaudium habuisse, et ideo
Venerandi Patres ad hanc vos peragendum congregandos decrevimus Synodum, ut de
omnibus nuper advenientibus ad Christum, ipsi aeternas Domino gratias
deferatis. Quicquid vero verbis apud Sacerdotium vestrum nobis agendum erat de
fide atque spe nostra, quam gerimus, in hoc Tomo conscripta atque allegata,
notescimus. Relegatur ergo in medio vestri, et in Iudicio Synodali examinata,
per omne succiduum tempus Gloria nostra ejusdem fidei Testimonio decorata
clarescat. Susceptus est autem ab omnibus Dei Sacerdotibus, offerente Rege,
sacrosanctae fidei tomus, et pronunciante Notario clara voce recensitus est
ita, etc. Here this King himself draws up a Confession of his Faith, and
commands it to be publicly read in the Synod; which was generally received by
all the Bishops and Priests present in this Council, was read with a loud voice
in this memorable form. Quamvis Deus omnipotens, pro utilitatibus populorum
regni, nos culmen subire tribuerit, et moderamen gentiumnon paucarum regiae
nostrae curae commiserit, meminimus tamen nos mortalium condition perstringi,
nec posse felicitatem futurae beatitudinis aliter promereri, nisi nos cultui
verae fidei deputemus, et conditori nostro, saltem confessione, qua dignus est
ipse, placeamus. Pro qua re quanto subditorum gloria regali extollimur, tanto
providi esse debemus (Let Baronius, Popes and Popish Prelates observe it, who
deny that Kings have ought to do in matters of Faith and Religion) in his quae
ad Deum sunt, vel nostram spem augere, vel gentibus nobis a Deo creditis
consulere. Caeterum, quid pro tantis beneficiorum collationibus omnipotentiae
divinae valemus tribuere? Psalm: 16.
quando omnia ipsius sint, et bonorum nostroum nihil egeat, nisi ut in eum sic
tota devotione credimus, quemadmodum per scripturas sacras se ipse intelligi
voluit, et credi praecepit? id est, ut confiteamur esse Patrem, qui genuerit ex
substantia sua Filium sibi and coequalem et coaeternum: Non tamen ut idem ipse
sit natus and genitor, sed persona alius sit Pater, qui genuit, alius sit
Filius qui fuerit generatus, unius tamen uterque substantiae in divinitate
subsistat. Pater, ex quo sit Filius, ipse vero ex nullo sit alio: Filius qui
habeat Patrem, sed sine initio and sine diminutione, in ea, qua Patri
coaequalis and coaeternus est divinitate subsistat. Spiritus sanctus
confitendus a nobis est et praedicandus, a Patre and Filio procedere, and cum
Patre and Filio unius esse substantiae. Tertiam vero in Trinitate Spiritus
sancti esse personam, qui tamen communem habeat cum Patre and Filio divinitatis
essentiam. Haec enim Sancta Trinitas, unus Deus est; Pater and Filius, and
Spiritus sanctus, cujus bonitate omnis licet bona sit condita creatura, per
assump^am tamen a Filio humani habitus formam, a damnata progeny reformamur ad
beatitudinem pristinam. Sed sicut verae salutis indicium est Trinitatem in
Unitate, and Vnitatem in Trinitate sentire, ita erit consummata justitia, si
candem fidem intra Vniversalem Ecclesiam teneamus, et Apostolicam Vnitatem in
Apostolico positi fundamento, servemus. Tamen vos Dei Sacerdotes, meminisse
oportet, quantis hucusqae Ecclesia Dei catholica per Hispanias adversae partis
molestiis laboraverit, dum and Catholici constanter fidei suae tenerent ac
defenderent veritatem, and Haeretici pertinaciori animositate propriae
niterentur Perficiae.

excitavit, ut depulsa obstinatione, infidelitatis et discordiae submoto furore,
populum qui sub nomine religionis famulabatur errori, ad agnitionem fidei, et
Ecclesiae Catholicae consortium revocarem. Adest enim omnis gens Gothorum

Patres has nobilissimas gentes, quae Dominicis lucris PER NOS applicatae sunt,

Erit enim mihi immarcessibilis corona, vel gaudium in retributione Iustorum, si
hi populi, qui NOSTRA ad unitatem Ecclesiae SOLERTIA transcurrerunt, fundati in
eadem et stabiliti permaneant. Sicut enim DIVINO NUTU NOSTRAE CURAE FUIT HOS

docibilitatis, catholicis eos dogmatibus instituere, quo in toto cognitione
veritatis instructi, noverint ex solido errores Haeresis perniciosae respuere,
and verae fidei tramitem ex charitate retinere, vel Catholicae Ecclesiae
communionem desiderio avidiori amplecti. Caeterum, sicut facile ad veniam
pervenisse confido, quod nescia hucusque tam clarissima erraverit gens, ita
gravius esse non dubito, si agnitam veritatem dubio cord teneat, atque a
patenti lumine (quod absit) oculos suos avertat. Unde valde pernecessarium esse

ideo, tanquam ante conspectum Dei, ita in medio vestri fidem meam protuli,

Proinde, sicut Anathematizo Arrium, cum omnibus dogmatibus et complicibus
suis, qui Unigentum Dei filium a paterna degenerem asserebat esse substantia,
nec a patre genitum, sed ex nihilo dicebat esse creatum, vel omnia concilia
malignantium quae adversus Sanctam Synodum Nicenam extiterunt; ita in honorem
et laudem Dei fidem sanctam Niceni observo Concilii, et honoro; ea quae contra
eundem rectae fidei Arrium pestem trecentorum december et octo sancta Episcopalis
scripsit Synodus. Amplector itaque et teneo fidem Centum Quinquaginta
Episcoporum Constantinopoli congregatorum, quae Macedonium, Spiritus sancti
substantiam minorantem, and a Patris and Filii unitate and essentia
segregantem, jugulo veritatis interemit. Primae quoque Ephesinae Synodi fidem,

puritate non dissonant, pari veneratione observo. Properet ergo reverentia

Ecclesiam perceperunt Spiritum, quem unum and aequalem cum Pair and Filio
confitentes, ejusque Dono in sinu Ecclesiae sanctae Catholicae collatae sunt,
si eorum aliqui hanc rectam and sanctam Confessionem nostram minime credere
voluerint, iram Dei cum Anathemate aeterno percipiant, et de interitu suo
fidelibus gaudium, infidelibus sint in exemplum. Huic vero confessioni meae,
sanctas suprascriptorum Conciliorum constitutiones contexui, et testimonio
divino tota cordis simplicitate subscripsi. Then follow the 3. Confessions of
faith: viz. Confessio Nicenae Synodi, Credimus, etc. Symbolum CL. Patrum

Next, this Kings and his Queens subscriptions, to this his Confession of faith,
which was publicly read, Ego Reccaredus Rex fidem hanc sanctam et veram
Confessionem, quam una per totum orbem Catholica confitetur Ecclesia, cord
retinens, ore affirmans, mea dextera Deo protegente subscripsi. Ego Badda
gloriosa Regina hanc fidem, quam credidi et suscepi, manu mea de toto cord
subscripsi. Which being read, Tunc acclamatum est in laudibus Dei et in favore
Principis ab universo Concilo: Gloria Deo Patri, and Filio, and Spiritui
sancti, cui cura est pacem and unitatem Ecclesiae suae Sanctae Catholicae
providere. Gloria Domino nostro Jesu Christo, qui precio sanguinis sui
Ecclesiam Catholicam ex omnibus gentibus congregavit. Gloria Domino nostro Jesu
Christo, qui tam illustrem gentem unitati fidei verae copulavit, et unum
gregem, and unum Pastorem instituit. Cui a Deo aeternum meritum, nisi vero
Catholico Reccaredo Regis? Cui a Deo aeterna corona, nisi vero Orthodoxo
Reccaredo Regi? Cui praesens Gloria et aeterna nisi vero amatori Dei Reccaredo
regi? Ipse novarum plebium in Ecclesia conquisitor. Ipse mereatur veraciter
Apostolicum meritum, qui Apostolicum implevit officium (Mark these expressions
of all those Bishops and Priests) Ipse sit Deo et hominibus amabilis qui tam
mirabiliter Deum glorificavit in terris, praestante Domino nostro Jesus Christo,
qui cum Deo Patre vivit and r^gnat in unitate Spiritus sancti in secula
seculorum.

After this the Bishops, Priests, Nobles assembled in this Council having thus
approved, applauded this Kings Confession of his faith, drew up another of
their own concurring in form and substance with the Kings, which not only the
Bishops and Priests, but likewise, (...) Council: Tom: 2. p. 671, 672.

Post Confessionem ergo and subcriptionem omnium Episcoporum, et totius gentis
Gothicae Seniorum, Gloriosissimus Dominus noster Reccaredus Rex, pro reparandis
simul et confirmandis disciplinae Ecclesiasticae moribus, Dei Sacerdotes
taliter affatus est, dicens. Regia cura usque in eum modum protendi debet et
dirigi, quam plenam constiterit aetatis et scientiae capere rationem. Nam sicut
in rebus humanis eminet potestas regia, ita et prospiciendae commoditati
comprovincialium major debet esse et providentia. At nunc, beatissimi
Sacerdotes, non in eis tantummodo rebus diffundimus solertiam nostram, quibus
populi sub nostro regimine positi pacatissime gubernentur et vivant, sed etiam
in adjutorio Christi, extendimus nos ad ea, quae sunt coelestia, cogitare, et
quae populos fideles efficiant satagimus non nescire. This being the principal
part of his Regal office and care.) Caeterum si totis nitendum est viribus,
humanis moribus modum ponere, and insolentium rabiem regia potestate refrenare,
si quieti and paci propagandae opem debemus impendere; multo magis est
adhibenda solicitudo, (mark it) desiderare, et cogitare divina, inhiare ad
sublimia, et ab errore retractis populis veritatem eis se renae lucis
ostendere. Sic enim agit qui multiplici bono se a Deo remunerari confidit. Sic
enim agit qui super id, quod ei committitur, Luc. 10.
auget, dum illi dicitur, Quicquid supererogaveris, ego cum rediero reddam
tibi. Ergo quia jam fidei nostrae and confessionis formam plena serie vestra
beatitudo recensuit, simulque et Sacerdotum nostrorumq, Procerum fides atque
confessio sanctitati vestrae perpatuit, hoc adhuc necessario pro firmitate
Catholicae fidei nostra Deo supplex instituere decrevit authoritas, ut propter
roborandum gentis nostrae novellam conversionem, omnes Hispaniarum and Galiciae
Ecclesiae hanc regulam servent, ut omni sacrificii tempore ante communicationem
corporis Christi et sanguinis, iuxta Orientalium partium morem, unanimiter
clara voce sacratissimum fidei recenseant Symbolum, ut primum populi, quam
credulitatem teneant fateantur, and sic cord fide purificata ad Christi
corporis and sanguinem percipiendum exhibeant, etc. De caet^ro autem
prohibendis insolentium moribus mea vobis consentiente^cl mentia, sententiis
terminate districtioribus, and firmiore disciplina quae facienda non sunt,
prohibete, et ea quae fieri debent immobili constitutione firmate. Whereupon
they drew up 23. Canons to this purpose according to this Kings direction; who
ratified them by this ensuing Royal Decree, wherein the heads of them are all
recited.

Edictum Regis de Confirmatione Concilii. Gloriosisimus Dominus Reccaredus Rex,
universis sub Regimine nostrae potestatis existentibus. Amatores nos sui divini
favoris veritas, nostris principaliter sensibus inspiravit, ut causa
instaurandae fidei ac disciplinae Ecclesiasticae, Episcopos omnes Hispaniae
nostro praesentari culmini juberemus. Pracedente autem diligenti et tanta
deliberatione, sive quae ad fidem convenient, seu quae ad morum correctionem
respiciant, sensus maturitate, and intelligentiae gravitate constant esse
digesta. Nostra proinde authoritas id omnibus, ad regnum nostrum pertinentibus
jubet, ut quae definita sunt in hoc sancto Concilio nulli contemnere liceat,
nullus praeterire praesumat. Capitula enim quae nostris sensibus placita et
disciplinae congrua, a praesenti conscripta sunt Synodo, in omni authoritate,
sive Clericorum, sive quorumcunque omnium, observentur et maneant. Then
reciting their heads, he concludes, Has omnes constitutiones Ecclesiasticas
quas summatim breviterque perstrinximus, sicut before in Canones continentur,
manner perenni stabilitate sancimus. Si quis ergo Clericus aut Laicus harum
sanctionum obediens esse nosuerit, si Episcopus, Presbyter, Diaconus aut
Clericus fuerit, ab omni Concilio excommunicationi subjaceat. Si vero Laicus
fuerit, and honestioris loci persona est, medietatem facultatum suorum amittat
fisci juribus profuturam; si vero minoris loci persona est, amissione rerum
suarum mulctatus, in exilium deputetur. Flavius Reccaredus Rex, hanc
deliberationem, quam cum sancta diffinimus Synodo, confirmans subscripsi.

It is very observable that this King Surius, Tom. 2. p. 671.
Reccaredus by his power, piety, and example converted all the Bishops, Clergy,
Nobles and others of the whole Gothish Nation, from the Arrian Heresy which
they anathematized, to the Orthodox faith, as they all thus acknowledged in
this Council. Tunc Episcopi omnes una cum Clericis suis, Primoresque gentis
Gothicae, pari consensione dixerunt, Licet hoc jam olim conversionis nostrae
tempore egerimus, quando secuti gloriosissimum Dominum nostrum Reccaredum Regem
ad Ecclesiam transivimus, et perfidiam Arrianam, cum omnibus superstitionibus
suis anathematizavimus, pariterque abjecimus: After which protesting their
unanimous, cordial believing, embracing, profession of the Kings Orthodox
faith, they denounced many Anathemaes against the Arrian heresy, and each
branch thereof; subjoyning this ingenuous confession of their Conversion from
their heresy, by this Kings means, and their cordial embracing of his faith.
Comfitemur, nos ex haeresi Arriana toto cord, tota anima, and tota mente
nostra ad Ecclesiam catholicam fuisse conversos. Nulli dubium sit, nos,
nostrosque decessores errasse in haeresi Arriana, and fidem Evangelicam, atque
Apostolicam nunc intra Ecclesiam Catholicam didicisse. Proinde fidem sanctam
quam religiosissimus Dominus noster patefecit in medio Concilii, et manu sua
subscripsit, hanc et nos tenemus, hanc confitemur pariter et suscipimus, hanc
in populis praequicare, atque docere promittimus. Haec est vera fides, quam
omnis Ecclesia, dum per totum mundum tenet, Catholica esse creditur, and
probatur, 1 Cor. 16.
Cui haec fides non placet, aut non placuerit, sit Anathema Maranatha in
adventu Domini nostri Jesu Christi, etc. All of them unanimously embracing;
subscribing, professing perpetually to adhere to that Confession of the
Catholic faith, which this their religious King (who converted them) had made
and read unto them in this Synod; anathematizing all such who disliked, or
assented not thereunto.

I have transcribed these Speeches, passages, Confession, and Charter of
Confirmation of this pious King and Synod even in Spain it self (where the Pope
now most predominates) because they justify the Emperor Justinians
Ecclesiastical Authority, Laws, Proceedings, (so much decryed by Here, p. 133,
etc.
Baronius) demonstrate the care and duty of the antientest Christian Kings in
Spain and elsewhere to promote the orthodox faith, true worship, service of
God, conversion, salvation of their Subjects souls as the principal means of
their temporal and eternal felicity: and utterly subvert the antichristian
assertions of Popes, Popish Canonists, Prelates, Priests; Gratian, did: 96. and
Glossa.
Quaecunque a Principibus terrae in ordinibus, vel in Ecclesiasticis rebus
decreta inveniuntur, authoritatis nullius esse monstrantur, cum Laici de^ rebus

That this matter is so clear, that no secular Prince from the beginning of the
world till this day, can be named, who by the ordinary power of a Prince
(without the gift of Prophecy or special Revelation) did laudably meddle with
Religion, as a Judge, or ruler of spiritual causes, etc. And refutes the
received answer of Civilians and Canonists on Justinians most excellent Law
concerning Bishops and Priests, to this Question, Autenticorum Collatio, l 1.
Tit: 6. Gloss^. Sancimus, f. 1^.
Ad quid se intromittat Imperator de Spiritualibus vel Ecclesiasticis, cum
sciat ad se non pertinere? To which if any answer be given, it must be
principally this: Dic, quod authoritate Papae hoc facit; by whose Authority
neither any pious Emperors, nor this Spanish King ever held, summoned Councils,
or made, confirmed the recited orthodox Confessions of faith, nor their
Ecclesiastical Laws or Constitutions, but by their own Regal Supremacies.

Epist. l. 4. Epist. 34, 82.
Pope Gregory the 1. surnamed the Great, Anno 5^^
most frequently prays to God for the Emperor Mauritius, and styles him his
Lord, and most excellent Lord: adding, Deus vos universo mundo praeesse
constituit. Epist: l. 2. Epist: 62 l. 3. Epist: 61^
Potestas Dominorum meorum caelitus data est super omnes homines; himself
subjecting his Papal Miter to his Imperial commands, not out of mere humility,
but bounden duty and conscience; as his Ego sum servus vester, O Imperator, ego
vestrae jussioni subjectus; ego quod debui erolvi, qui Imperatori obedientiam
praebui, attest. He begins one of his Epistles to him thus, Epist: l. 5, Epist
63.
Inter animarum curas, et innumerabiles solicitudines quas indefesso studio pro
Christianae reipublicae regimine sustinetis, magna mihi, et universo mundo
saetitiae causa est, quod pietas vestra Custodiae fidei, qua Dominorum fulget
Imperium, praecipua solicitudine semper invigilat. Vnde omnino confido, servat
vos Deus, causa Religiosae mentis amore tuemini; ita Deus vestras Majestates
sua gratia tuetur et adjuvat. Another Epistle begins thus, Epist. l. 6. Epist:
6.
Omnipotens Deus, qui pietatem vestram pacis Ecclesiasticae fecit esse
custodem, ipse vos fide servat, etc. Pro qua re totis precibus deprecamur ut
bonum hoc Omnipotens Deus Serenitati Dominorum, piaeque eorum soboli, et in
praesenti seculo, atque in perpetua remuneratione retribueret. And he concludes
another Epistle to him thus, Epist. l. ^6. Ep 31. and 6. Epist. 2.
Omnipotens autem Deus serenissimi Domini nostri vitam, et ad pacem sanctae
Ecclesiae, et ad utilitatem Reipublicae Romanae (both coupled together by him,
as his office, duty in and toward both alike) per tempora longa custodiat. In

Leontiae Augustae, he thus prays to Almighty God; ut cor vestrae pietatis sua
semper dextra teneat, ejusque cogitationes caelestis gratiae open dispenset,
Ouatenus tranquillitas vestra rectius valeat sibi servientes regere, quanto
Dominatori omnium noverit minus deservire. In amore catholicae fidei faciat
Defensores suos, quas fecit ex benigno opere Imperatores nostros. Infundat
vestris mentibus zelum simul and mansuetudinem, ut semper pro fervore valearis,
et quicquid in Deo exceditur, non inultum relinquete, et si quid vobis
delinquitur, parcendo tolerare, etc. Yea he thus declaims against and censures
that Title of Universal Bishop, and Head of the Universal Church, which his
successors so much contend for, as Antichristian, Epist. l. 4. (...) 34 l. 5.
Ep. 3^^
Ego fidenter dico, quod quisquis se Vniversalem Sacerdotem vocat, vel vocari
desiderat, in elatione sua Antichristum praecurrit, quia superbiendo se
caeteris praeponit. Yea he tells Mauritius the Emperor, that this Title is,
contra statuta Evangelica, contra Canonum Decreta; That Nullus unquam
praedecessorum suorum hoc tam prophano vocabulo uti consenserit. Quia si unus
Patriarcha universalis dicetur, Patriarcharum nomen caeteris derogetur. Epist:
l. 4. Epistt 3^ 36, 38. l. 7. Ep. 3^ and 39. and l. 6^. Ep. 2^. and 28.
Si unus Episcopus vocatur Vniversalis, tota Ecclesia corruit. What would he
have said of his successors think you, who not only challenge this Title de
Jure, but the Titles of Here, p. 25, ^0. to 52, 60, ^2, 69.
Rex Regum, and Dominus Dominorum, Deus, and Vice-Deus too?

thus resolves; Sub religionis disciplina seculi Potestates subjecti sunt: and
quamvis culmine regio sint praediti, vinculo tamen fidei tenentur astricti, ut
et fidem Christi suis legibus praedicent, et ipsam fidei praedicationem moribus
bonis conservent. Principes seculi nonnunquam intra Ecclesiam potestatis
adeptae culmina tenent, ut per eandem potestatem disciplinam Ecclesiasticam
muniant. Caeterum intra Ecclesiam potestates necessariae non essent, nisi, ut
quod non praevalet Sacerdos efficere per doctrinae Sermonem, potestas hoc
imperet per disciplinae terrorem. Sane per regnum terrenum coeleste regnum
proficit, ut qui intra Ecclesiam positi contra fidem et disciplinam agunt,
rigore Principum conterantur, ipsamque disciplinam quam Ecclesiae humilitas
exercere non praevalet, cervicibus superborum potestas Principum imponat, et ut
venerationem mereatur, virtute potestatis impertiat. Cognoscant Principes
seculi Deo et debere se rationem reddere propter Ecclesiam quam a Christo
tuendam recipient. Nam sive augeatur par et disciplina Ecclesiae per fideles
Principes, sive solvatur, ille ab eis rationem exiget, qui eorum potestati suam
Ecclesiam credidit. What more punctual to our Proposition (That Princes have
the chief care of the Church, and their peoples souls, for which they must give
an account to God:) then this his resolution? Sententiarum l. 3. c. 48, 49, 50,

excellentissimo and glorioso Regi, cuius tanta devotio extat, ut non solum in
rebus humanis, SED ETIAM IN CAUSIS DIVINIS SOLICITUS MANEAT: Who when this
Council was set, pro merito fidei suae, cum Magnificentissimis and Nobilissimis
Viris ingressus, religiosa prosecutione Synodum exhortatus est, ut paternorum
decretorum memores, ad confirmanda in nobis jura Ecclesiastica studium
praeberemus, and illa corigere, quae dum per negligentiam in usum venerunt,
contra Ecclesiasticos mores lic^ntiam sibi de usurpatione fecerunt. Talibus
ergo ejus monitis gaudentes, necessarium extitit iuxta eius nostrumque votum,
contractare quae competunt, sive in Sacramentis divinis, quae diverso atque

usurpata noscuntur. In this Council not only Bishops, Priests, Deans, but the
Nobility of Spain, ^ cap. 3. Surius, p. 728.
et Laici qui electioni Concilii inesse meruerunt, were present. After all
their Canons for confirmation of the Christian faith, reformation of manners in
the Clergy and Laity, and repressing the exorbitances of Heretics and Jews,
Can. 74. they add a Canon pro robore nostrorum Regum, and stabilitate gentis
Gothorum, denouncing a solemn excommunication against all persons who contrary
to their Oath of Allegiance and duty should attempt any Treason against the
Kings person, life, or usurp the Crown, etc. And then conclude the Acts of this
Council with this Prayer. Ibid. p. 738.
Pax and salus and diuturnitas piissimo and amatori Christi Domino nostro
Sisenando Regi, cujus devotio nos ad hoc salutiferum decretum convocavit:
Corroboret ergo Christi gratia regnum illius, gentisque Gothorum in fide

Amen. Definitis itaque his, quae superius comprehensa sunt, annuente

exhortatione coegit, atque hanc institutionem quam ex praecepto ejus, and
devoto nostro sancimus divina inspiratione praemisit, as one; or permisit, as
another Copy renders it. Can. 7. decrees, Ut in omni Concilio Episcoporum

publica voce deb^at pronunciari, quatenus saepe replicatum auribus, vel
assidnitate iniquorum men's territa corrigatur, quae ad praevaricandum and
oblivione and facilitate perducitur. Can. 8. they grant the King power to
dispense offenses against the Canons of this Council. In his omnibus quae
praemisimus potestatem indulgentiae in culpis delinquentium Principi
reservamus, ut jurta bonitatis suae ac pietatis moderamen, ubi emendationem
presfexerit mentium, veniam tribuat culparum. After their thanks to God, they
conclude; Post haec gratias excellentissimo gloriosissimo Principi nostro
Chintillano regi peragimus, cujus ardor fidei et bonae intentionis, et unitatis
concordiam nobis tribuit, et fiduciam charitatis. Donet ei Dominus and de
inimicis triumphum, and de beatitudine gaudium, custodiat cum protectione

gratias Domino omnipotenti coelorum agimus; eo quod ei tam illustrem creavit

provide for the safety, succession of this King and his posterity, against all
Tr^asons, Usurpations, Conspiracies and pretenders: Nefas est enim in dubium

fruatur, and divinae dexterae protectione ubique muniatur.

Seve^inus being elected Pope by the Clergy and people of Rome, Anno 638
Isacius Italiae Exarchus Roman veniens, eum in Pontificatu confirmavit: tunc
enim temporis Cleri et populi electio nihil valebat, nisi confirmatio
Imperatoris aut eius Exarchi accederet. A strong evidence of the Emperors
Supreme Jurisdiction over Popes, not of Popes over them. Honorius his
predecessor having heaped up a great mass of moneys in Episcopio Lateranensi;
Isacius entreated Severinus, ut aliquid in militares sumptus conferret; who
denying it, thereupon others stirred up the Roman Army against him; saying,
Quid prodest, quod tantae pecuniae congregatae sunt in Episcopio Lateranensi,
ab Honorio Papa, and Miles iste nihil subventus habet? Whereupon all the
Soldiers, from the youngest to the eldest, besieged and assaulted the Popes
Palace, sealed up the Treasury till Isacius came from Ravenna to Rome; qui
misit omnes Primates Ecclesiae singulos per singulas Civitates in exilium, ut
non fuisset qui ei resistere debuisset de Clero; and then entering the Popes
Palace continued there 8. days, until he had seized on and removed all the
Treasure, part whereof he sent to the royal City of Constantinople to Heraclius
the Emperor. So little Sovereign Authority had Popes in that age over the
Emperor, or his Officers; who patiently submitted to this plunder, without
thundering out any excommunication against the Soldiers, Officers, or Emperor.

recite. The 7th. Council of Toledo (summoned Studio and jussu amatoris Christi
Chindasiundi Regis nostri) cap. 1. provides against Perfidious Clerks and
Laymen, who in foreign parts plotted Treason against the King and Kingdom, in
necem regis seu eversionem; that they should be excommunicated, forfeit all
their estates, and made incapable to enjoy them, unless the King should please
to allow them some part thereof upon their submission: and after 5. other
Canons of Ecclesiastical affairs, No^ autem universali Deo, and glorioso
Chindasiundo Principi, ob cujus votum in hanc urbem sancta devotione

Rome in the Church of our Savior called Constantiniana, by Theodorus the
Exarch and others, brought Prisoner from Rome to Constantinople, and banished
into a place called Chersona, where he died; for refusing to subscribe a Book
sent to him by the Emperor, through Paulus the Patriarch his direction, which
Pope Martin conceived to be heretical.

took their places, made an Oration to them, there related; grates deferens Deo
virtutum, quod suae jussionis implentes Decretum in unum fuissemus adunati
Concilium. Then tendering them a Tome or Book containing the Confession of his
faith (as his Predecessor K. Here, p. 146, 147, 148.
Reccaredus did in the 3. Council of Toledo) and what things else he desired to
be done and voted in, by this Council; he exhorted them; ut quaecunque illic
tenentur asscripta, valido attendatis intuitu, sagaci perscrutamini studio, et
quaecunque extiterint placita Deo, vestri oris ad nos sacro referantur oraculo.
The Council, Accepto deinde oblato nobis Tomo, agente Domino gratias,
acclamavimus Gloria in excelsis Deo, etc. Post eidem sacro Principi
benediximus, reseratoque Tomo, haec inibi contexta reperimus; which were read.
It begins with the confession of his faith, which he recommended to the
Council, wherein there is this memorable Passage: Primo itaque coram se
reverentia vestra habeat; quod nosse non ambigit, me orthodoxae fidei veram,
sanctam et synceram regulam, de cord puro et conscientia bona plenissime
habere, sicut eam sancta atque Apostolica traditio doceat, si cut eam sancta
Synodus Niceae constituit, sicut Constantinopoli sanctorum Patrum congregatio
definivit; sicut Ephesini primi coetus unitas affirmavit; sicut Chalcedonensi
Concilii definitio protulit. Hanc cum fidelibus servans, ad hanc salvandos
infideles invitans, in hanc subjectos populos regens, hanc propriis gentibus
tenendam insinuans, hanc populis alienis annuncians; ut in illa glorificans
Deum, et inter mortales nos summae divinitatis felicitas assequatur, et in
terra viventium haereditas a me gloriae capiatur. Then relating what good
works he desired to do, and to be done by himself and others, to adorn,
advance this faith, that it might not prove a dead faith; he concludes and
subscribes it, thus. Item subscriptio. In nomine Domini Flavius Recessuinthus
Rex hanc fidei and bonae voluntatis meae deliberationem manu mea subscripsi.
This whole Council relecta Tomi pagina, cum glorificassemus Deum de fidei
principalis auditu, et de bonae voluntatis ejus effectu; drew up a uniform
profession of their faith, and other Canons answerable to the Kings: Which
being subscribed by the Bishops, Abbots, and viri illustres officii Palatini,
(even 18. Earls and Dukes, besides others) were ratified by the King. This
Council by a Decree in the name of the King; made a Law concerning the Lands
and goods purchased by their Kings, which of them should go with the Crown, and
which they might dispose of to their Sons: These Councils being all properly
Parliaments, wherein the King and Nobles sat, voted, subscribed, as well as
Bishops and Priests, and made Civil Laws for the King and kingdom, as well as
Ecclesiastical for the orthodox Faith and Church.

longaeva tempora concederet; Enacting, that every one who attempted any thing
contra salutem Principum, gentisque aut patriam, violated his Oaths of
allegiance to them, mox propria dignitate privatus, and loco and honor
habeatur exclusus; reserving only a power and liberty to the King to restore
him to his place or honor, or both, if he saw cause. And the 1. Surius Council:

It is evident by Fredericus Lindebrogus his Codex Legum Antiquarum, Legis
Wisigothorum, lib. 1, 2. and Lex Burgundiorum, Lex Bohemorum, and Lex
Longobardorum; that these Councils of Toledo forecited, and those under
Chilperick and other Kings of France and Italy, were in nature of parliaments;
wherein these Kings made and promulged Ecclesiastical Laws, intermixed with
their Temporal, by the advice and assistance Principum, Ducum, Optimatum and
Primatum consulente multitudine; as well as of their Bishops and Clergy, who
only did what they prescribed and directed them. Anno 676

Dei Ecclesia Christianissimi vestri Imperii, de talium doctorum erroribus, etc.
Haec autem ideo Deum omnipotentem felicibus vestrae mansuetudinis ad emendandum
credimus reservasse temporibus, ut locum et Zelum ipsius Domini nostri Jesus
Christi, qui vestrum Imperium coronare dignatus est, facientes in terris, pro
ejus Evangelica et Apostolica veritate JUSTUM JUDICIUM PROFERATIS, (of which
this Pope acknowledges the Emperors Supreme Judges) Quia dum humani generis
Redemptor atque Salvator, sit injuriam passus, nunc usque sustinuit, vestraeque
fortitudinis adspiravit imperio, ut ejusfidei causam (sicut aequitas exigit,
and sanctorum Patrum, sacrarumque Generalium quinque Synodorum decrevit
instructio) exequi dignemini, et redemptoris ac conregnatoris injuriam de suae
fidei contemptoribus per ejus praesidium ulciscamini, propheticum illud
vaticinium cum imperiali clementia magnanimiter adimplentes, Psalm. 68.
quia Rex et Propheta David ad Deum loquitur; Zelus domus tuae, inquiens,
comedit me. Unde pro tali Deo placito zelo collaudamus, Act. 13.
illam beatam vocem audire a creatore omnium meruit: Inveni David virum
secundum cor meum, qui faciat omnes voluntates meas. Cui and in Psalmis
pollicetur, Psalm. 88.
Inveni David servum meum, oleo sancto meo unxi eum: manus enim mea
auxiliabitur ei, and brachium meum confortabit eum: ut cujus causam
conflagranti studio elaborat Christinae clementiae vestrae piissimus
Principatus efficere, remunerationis gratia, omnes actus fortissimi eorum
Imperii felices et prosperos faciet, qui in suis sacris Evangeliis repromittit,
Mat. 6.
inquiens, Quaerite primum regnum coelorum and haec adjicientur vobis. Omnes
enim ad quos sacrarum apicum pervenit notitia, and quia sic benigniter augustae
magnanimitatis vestrae mansuetu^in^s est demonstratus intentus, innumer as
gratiarum actiones and incessabiles lands, admirati de tantae Clementia
magnitudine propagatori vestri fortissimi imperii persolverint, quia vere ut
pussimi et aequissimi Principes quae De^ sunt, cum Dei timore dignati estis
peragere. Unde and laus ab omnibus Nationibus Christianis, and per^nnis
memoria, et frequens oration pro sospitate, triumphalibus, ac perfectis
victoriis concedendis, ante Christum Dominum, cujus causa est, effundantur,
quatenus supernae majestatis terrore perculsae Gentium nationes sub sceptris
vestri robustissimi Principatus humiliter colla prostervant, et piissimi regni
vostri continuetur potentia dum temporali Imperio aeterni regni succedit
perennis felicitas. Nec enim poterit aliud simillimum inveniri, quod vestrae
invictissimae fortitudinis divinae Majestati commendat Clementiam, quam ut
repulsis a regula veritatis erroribus Evangelicae atque Apostolicae nostrae
fidei ubique illustretur et praedicetur integritas, etc. Obsecro itaque
piissime Auguste, atque una cum mea exiguitate Omnis anima Christiana suo flexo
genu suppliciter deprecatur ut etiam hoc ad redintegrationem perfectae pietatis
conregnatori Christo Domino hostiam acceptibilem offerre jubeatis; verbum
impunitatis concedentes et liberam loquendi facultatem unicuique loqui volenti,
and verbum impendere pro fide, quatenus omnes unanimiter pro tanto and tam
inestimabili bono per cunctum vitae suae spatium divinam Majestatem
glorificent, and pro incolumitate atque exaltatione fortissimi vestri Imperii,
unanimiter incessabiles Christo Domino preces effundant. Piissimorum Dominorum
imperium gratia superna custodiat, eisque omnium gentium colla substernat.
Moreover this Surius, Tom: 2. p. 922.
Pope Agatho, and the Synod of Rome, begin their Epistle to these Emperors, and
Instructions to their Delegates in this General Council, thus, Piissimis
Dominis, ac serenissimis Victoribus ac Triumphatoribus dilectis filiis Dei and
Domini nostri Jesu Christi, Constantino magno Imperatori, Heraclio and Tiberio
Augustis, Agatho Episcopus, Servus servorum Dei, cum universis Synodis
subjacentibus Concilio Apostolicae sedis. Omnium bonorum spes inesse
praenoscitur, dum Imperia^e fastigium ejus, a quo se coronatum, et hominibus
praefectum ad salubriter gubernandum dignoscit, veram de eo confessionem, qua
sola prae omnibus muneribus delectatur, inquirit fideliter, et vivaciter
amplecti desiderat. After which they style Rome a servile City to the Emperor,
Ibid. p. 924.
Concilium quod in hanc Romanam urbem servilem vestri Christianissimi Imperii,
etc. Subjoyning, Praeterea satisfaciendum est nostro exiguo familiatui apud
Serenissimorum Dominorum nostrorum clementiam pro tarditate missarum ex
Concilio nostro personarum, quas dirigi per suam Augustissimam sacram vestrum
piissimum fastigium jussit. For which they render a satisfactory reason. Then
pray, that the Confession of the faith they had sent by their Delegates might
be confirmed. Obsecrantes, ut a Deo coronato vestro imperio favente, haec eadem
omnibus praedicari, atque apud omnes obtinere jubeatis, ut Deus, qui veritatem
and justitiam diligit, omnia prostera vestra serenissimae dignitatis temporibus
donet, in quibus Apostolicae praedicationis pietatis veritas fulgeat, meliori
ac prospero successu rerum fortissimae tranquillitatis imperium laetari de
hostium subjectione concedens. Suscipere itaque dignamini piissimi Principum, a
nostra humilitate directos Episcopos, cum reliquis Ecclesiasticis ordinis
viris, atque religiosis servis Dei, cum solitae tranquillitatis clementia,
quatenus exipsorum testimony cum gratiarum action in propria revertentium,
apud omnes Nationes laus Clementiae vestrae celebrescat, sicut magni illius
Constantini, cujus post obitum ladabilis fama nihilominus viget, cujus insigne
non tantum potestatis est, sed pietatis: cum quo illud sacratissimum Concilium
318. Antistitum in Nicea civitate in defensione consubstantialis Trinitatis
convenit: and sicut Theodosii magni, cujus inter alias ejus virtutes,
singularis pietas praedicatur; quo advitente per sancti Spiritus gratiam 250
Patrum sententia, qui eis inspirabat, Spiritus sanctus consubstantialis Patri
and Filio praelicatus est, and sicut egregii veritatis amatoris Martiani
Principis, qui and primum Concilium Ephesinum, utpote Catholicam and
Apostolicam fidem praedicans a sancta Chalcedonensi Synodo suscipi fecit, et
errores qui accreverant, de Dei Ecclesia repulit: Et sicut extremi quidem,
praestantissimi tamen omnium, magni illius Justiniani, cujus ut virtus, ita et
pietas omnia in meliorem ordinem restauravit; cujus instar fortissimae vestrae
clementiae Principatus virtutis quidem conatibus Rempublicam Christianam
tuetur, et restaurat in melius, pietatisque studiis Catholicae succurrit
Ecclesiae, ut in Vnitate verae ac Apostolicae confessionis perfectius
copuletur, quam nunc usque nobiscum sancta Romana servat Ecclesia, quatenus
syncerae pietatis arcanum, tuba clarius per totum Orbem praedicetur, et ubi
hujus verae confessionis synceritas pii Vestri Imperii favoribus obtinet, laus
simul ac meritum Serenissimi vestri Imperii praedicetur, ut cum pietatis
laudibus, etiam regni eorum Deo annuente dilatentur insignia, quosque verae
pietatis invitat Confessio, impietatis fortitudo possideat. All these
expressions of this Pope and his whole Council, resolve 1. That they all in
most humble and dutiful manner acknowledged these Emperors to be their
Sovereign Lords; and that they owed all humble cheerful obedience to their
Summons and commands, even in matters of Faith, Religion, and Church Affairs.
2ly. That the right of summoning General Councils, and ordering, examining,
confirming the Votes, Confessions of Faith made by them, belonged to Emperors,
not to Popes, who were both summoned and came in person, or sent their Proxies
to them in obedience to their Summons. 3ly. That the principal care, defense,
propagation, preservation, perpetuation of the Orthodox faith and true worship
of God, belongs to Christian Emperors, not to Popes or Bps. 4ly. That God had
specially advanced them to the Empire for this very end; That this was the
principal part of their charge, office, care; and that God himself had made,
Constantine, Theolosius, Martianus, Justinian; and these present Emperors, (not
Popes and Bishops) the principal Instruments of establishing, propagating,
preserving the Christian Orthodox faith, suppressing Heresies, Schisms,
advancing true piety, and Christian peace, Unity throughout the Churches of
Christ, etc. All which are since reputed Heresy, and Sacrilegious
encroachments (like King See here, p. 25.
Uzziahs) on Popes, Bishops, Priests Hierarchies, Offices, by ambitious Popes
and Prelates.

In the 14. Action the frauds and impostures added, and thrust into the Acts of
the 5. General Council concerning Surius, Tom. 2. p. 1001, 1002, 1003, 1005,
1023.
Pope Vigilius and others, were examined by the Original parchment copies there
produced upon Oath, by George a Deacon Library Keeper to the Archbishop of
Constantinople, where the Emperor Justinian, and Glorisissimi Judices, and
Sanctum Concilium dixerunt; and directed the proceedings in this Examination.
And the Council often cry out, Sancti Quinti Concilii sempiterna memoria.
Multos annos Imperatori Constantino, Magno Imperatori multos annos. Pacifico
Imperatori, multos annos. Conservatori rectae fidei multos annos. Fili Dei da
illi vitam; Fili Dei, da victoriam illi. After which, Gloriosissimi Judices and
sanctu^ Concilium dixerunt, Sufficienter quidem habent quae hodierna die gesta
sunt; Polychronius autem religiosus Presbyter and Monachus, in subsequenti ad
nos perducatur, de propria fide sua interrogandus. Whereupon Actio 15. Ibidem,
p. 1006.
Residentibus per ordinem Gloriosissimis Patriciis and Consulibus omnibusque
venerabilibus Episcopis; Gloriosissimi Judices and Concilium dixerunt:
Ingre^iatur Polychronius: who tendered them an heretical Book and Confession of
his faith (which this confident Heretical Impostor presumed would raise a dead
man to life if laid upon him; which he there laying on a dead body experimented
before the Synod and people, with no success, but derision, and an exclamation
by the people; Novo Simoni Anathema, novo Seductori populi, Anathema:)
Notwithstanding, he obstinately persisting in his Heresy, thereupon was
degraded and anathematized; which done, Gloriosissimi Judices and Sanctum
Concilium dixerunt, Sufficient quae hodierna die acta sunt. In the 16 Action
there is the like proceeding; with a Gloriosissimi Judices dixerunt, Edicat
sanctum and Universale Concilium, si quicquam de his quae ad scrupulosiorem
indagationem pertinent, relictum est super praesenti Capitulo, etc. Sancta
Synodus dixit, Sufficienter quidem habent, etc. Ibid. p. 1010, 1116, 1118.
Actio 17. They read and subscribe the Confession of their Faith made in that
Synod: clozing it with these Acclamations, Christo dilecto multos annos.
Orthodoxe omnes credimus. Illuminatorem Pacis Domine conserva. Martiano novo
Constantino, aeterna memoria. Novo Justiniano Constantino, aeternamemoria. Qui
deposuit Haereticos, Domine conserva; anathematizing all these Heretics by
name. Actio 18. Pr^siadente eodem piissimo and a Christi dilecto Constantino
magno Imperatore, he sitting in this Council, Theodorus the Patriarchs Notary,
spoke thus unto him; Maximae pietatis exist it cognitio, tranquillissime
Domine, principaliter quae ad culturam divintatis attinent praecipuam
diligentiam adhibere dehinc causas quae Christo amabili Reipublicae competunt
recta consideratione dirigere, quod profecto benign peragitis, mansuetissime
omnem quidem secularium causarum sollicitudinem reponens, pro divinis vero
curam et studium per Spiritus sancti gratiam assumens. Et hic vester est
acceptabilis ornatus pietatem adversus Diaboli accersire malitiam, et contra
impietatis ejus cohortem, sacrum aggregare collegium, etc. Then tendering him
the Synods confession of faith, (read and subscribed by the Synod the day
before) to be read again in the Emperors presence, Constantinus piissimus
Imperator, dixit, Edicat sanctum et universale Concilium, si cum consensu
omnium Episcoporum promulgata est definitio, quae ad praesens relecta est:
Ibidem, p. 1021.
Sanctum Concilium exclamavit: Omnes ita credimus, Vna fides, Omnes id ipsum
sentimus; Omnes consentientes et amplectentes subscripsimus. Orthodoxi omnes
credimus. Haec est fides Apostolorum, haec est fides Patrum, haec est fides
Orthodoxorum, Multos annos Imperatori: Integritas duarum naturarum Christi, tu
declarasti; Luminarium pacis, Domine conserva. Martiano nova Constantino
aeterna memoria, Omnes haereticos tu effugasti, Dejectorem haereticorum Domine
conserva; Dividentes et con^undentes tu persequutus es. Absit invidia a vestro
Imperio. Deus custodiat foritudinem vestram. Deus regnum vestrum and Imperium
vestrum pacificet. Vestra vita, orthodoxorum vita est. Coelestis Rex, terestrem
conserva. Per te universales Ecclesiae pacificatae sunt. Nestorio, and Euticho
and Severo, anathema, etc. Omnibus haereticis anathema. Which ended,
Constantinus Imperator dixit, Deum testem proferimus sancto and universali
vestro Concilio, quod absque quolibet favore and invidia, principale desiderium
et zelus extitit nobis, irreprehensibilem esse immaculatam nostram orthodoxam
Christianorum fidem, et cum stabilitate nos eam conservare in nomine Dei,
secundum doctrinam and traditionem quae tradita est nobis tam per Evangelium,
quam per sanctos Apostolos, and per statuta Sanctorum quinque Universalium
Conciliorum, Sanctorumque probabilium Patrum, et non mediocriter nos pro hoc
desiderium coarctabat, ex quo (jubente Deo nostro) authoraliter accepimus
solium imperii nostri. Cum ergo Deo complacuit tempus concedere, invitavimus
fieri collectionem vestram, ad considerandum vobis Sanctas Dei Scripturas,
omnemque vocis sive assertionis novitatem, quae adjecta est ad intemeratam
nostram Christianorum fidem, in his vicinis temporibus a quibusdam prava
sentientibus expellendam, mundissimamque nobis hanc contradendam (sicut
praedictum est) quatenus, secundum Sancta and universalia quinque Concilia and
statutae Sanctorum Venerabilium Patrum, ita eam et nos custodiamus usque in
mortem, etc. Immediately after his Speech concluded, Sancta Synodus exclamavit,
Multos annos Imperatori, Christo dilecto Imperatori, multos annos; Pium et
Christianum Imperatorem Domine conserva, Orthodoxam fidem tu confirmasti.
Definitio Orthodoxa est; contradicenti huic definitioni anathema; Qui
contradixerit huic definitioni Nestorianus est: Qui non susceperit hanc
definitionem Eutichianista est. Eutichianis anathema, Omnibus Christo
rebellibus Haeresibus anathema. Aeterna memoria Imperatori. AEternum permaneat
vestrum Imperium. The Emperor rendering them his hearty thanks for their pains
in this Council, Surius, ibid. 1023.
Sanctum Concilium dixit, Piissime and tranquillissime Domine, Sermonem
acclamatorium ad Deo amabilem vestram potentiam, juxta morem composuimus, et si
placuerit pietati vestrae, hunc perlegi jubete. Constantinus piissimus
Imperator dixit, Acclamatorius sermo qui compositus est a vestro Concilio,
deferatur and Relegatur. Qui delatus est, and in his sermonibus relect. est. In
this Oration they use these memorable pasages to the Emperor. Vos enim per
Christum benign regnatis, Christus vero per vos Ecclesis suis pacem delegit
impartiri, etc. Quid vero est, et praesertim Imperatori decebilius, QUAM PRAE
OMNIBUS PIETATE ADORNARE SUBJECTOS, PER QUOD ET IN CAETERIS FELICITETUR
RESPUBLICA? Veruntamen vestris divalibus praeceptis acquiescentes, tam antiquae
Romae et Apostolicae summitatis pontificatus Antistites, quam nos humiles,
Christi tamen Sacerdotes atque ministri, etc. (Let Popes observe their
predecessors subjection to this Emperors supreme commands in coming to this
Council, etc.) Then applauding the Piety, Zeal of Constantine, Theodosius,
Martianus, and Justinian in summoning and ratifying the former General
Councils; they thus conclude. Ibid. p. 1024, 1025. Luc. 2.
Gloria in excelsis Deo, in terra pax, decantantes, dum Christo omnipotenti
complacuit suscitare Principem Deo dilectum, qui unitatis Ecclesiarum mediator
effectus est. Sed O Renignissime Domine and Amator Justitiae, ei qui tibi
potentiam largitus est hanc gratiam recompensa, and his quae a nobis gesta sunt
signaculum tribue, vestram inscribito Imperialem ratihabitionem, et per Edicta
divalia, atque per pias Constitutiones, ex more, eorum omnium firmitatem,
quatenus nullus his quae gesta sunt, aut contradicat, novamve quaestionem
machinetur. Scito enim Serenissime Imperator, quod nihil horum quae in Synodis
universalibus and a probabilibus patribus constituta sunt, falsavimus, verum
potius confirmavimus. Etenim omnes unanimiter atque consonanter acclamamus:
Domine salvum fac Regem nostrum, qui post te corroboravit fidei fundamentum:
benedicito vitam ejus, dirige gressus cogitationum ejus. Conterat virtutem
inimicorum suorum, and resistentes ei continuo corruant, quia fecit judicium,
and justitiam sempiternam, and periclitanti veritati manus porrexit, populumque
tuum salvavit, ad eadem sapere eos concilians. Gaude Civitas Nova Roma
Constantinopolis, glorificata nomine principali. Ecce Rex tuus fidelis sedet
fortissimus, and accipiet armaturam amulatricem ejus virtutem, indutus est
loricam Justitiae, and Sanctitatis circumposuit sibi galeam prudentiam, quae
est specula virtutum, and scutum assumpsit inexpugnabile, in Deum pietatem. His
armatum eum adspiciant Barbari, and speramus in Deum eos obtemperare dominanti.
Laetare Civitas Sion, Cacumen Orbis terrarum atque Imperium. Constantinus te
purpura praeornavit, et per fidem Coronavit, and Constantinus utrisque
supercoronavit, Portaeque inferi adversum tuum orthodoxum Imperium non
praevalebunt. Gaude, and fiducialiter age Imperator speciosissime: Dominus Deus
tuus in te potens; praecingens te virtute, salvabit te: adducet super te
jocunditatem and exultationem, ampliabiturque imperium tuum, and exaltabitur
brachium tuum et dominabitur cunctis Adversis, Deumque non agnoscentibus atque
attestantibus, et lamentabitur quidem hostilitas, gaudebit autem obedientia:
quia ego potens sum, dicit Dominus Omnipotens.

Hereupon the Emperor ratified the Confession of their Faith by this his
Imperial Edict, S^rius Tom. 2 p. 1025, etc.
into which he inserted it verbatim. In nomine Domini et Dominatoris Jesu
Christi, Salvatoris nostri, Imperator Piissimus, pacificus Flavius
Constantinus, fidelis in Jesus Christo Deo Imperator, Christo dilecto omni
populo habitanti in occiduis partibus. Firmamentum ac fundamentum superno nutu
creditae nobis Christianissimae existit Reipublicae, sides in Deo inflexibilis
et inconcussibilis, in qua Christus Deus noster tanquam propriam Domum suam
construxit Ecclesiam, and sicut Rex omnium, imperii nostri sedem constituit,
principatusq* nobis Sceptra commisit. sicut enim quandam Petram excelsamet
sublimem, and ut coeli, terraeque, in consortio constitutam mysticam
confessionem, quae in eum cum. Patre et Spiritu est Salvator nobis ostendit, ut
per eam tanquam per mediam scalam ad caelestem conversationem reducamur
diviniorisque regni potentia coronemur. Super hanc petram cogitationis nostrae
gressus infiximus, super quam firmiter stare praecipimur, quamque cautius
tenere subjectos praecipimus, ne quisquam, ut minus attentus, exagitetur a
maligno et instabili spiritu: expulsusque atque praecipitatus in impietatis
voraginem delabatur, etc. Idcirco et nos quae ab eis definita sunt, corroborare
atque firmare cupientes. praesens pium edictum dedimus, verae circa divinitatem
fidei secundum ecclesiastica statu^^ adnuncians confessionem. Then reciting the
Confession of the faith therein comprised, he thus proceeds: In hac fide
vivimus, et regnamus, et conregnanti nobis Deo conregnare denuo speramus. Hanc
Comitem, hinc recedentes habere deposcimus, and cum hac ante Christi tribunal
assistere. Ad hanc confessionem omnes hortamur, et deservire Deo nobiscum
invitamus, ac super montem excelsum Imperii stantes, praedicamus, atque
ecclesiasticam pacem totius populi solennitatem adnunciamus, etc. Si quis vero
hominum personis gratiam exhibet, Charitatis autem in Deum aemulatorem se non
demonstrat, Praesentemque nostram piam constitutionem non recipit, siquidem
Episcopus est vel Clericus, aut Monachico circundatus est habitu, deportationis
poenam exolvet. Si vero in ordine dignitatum insertus est, supplicio
proscriptionis mulctatur, eique Cingulum adimitur. Si autem idioticae sortis
est; ex hac Regia, omnique penitus Civitate extorris addicitur, et super haec
omnia, etiam terribilis atque inexpiabilis judicii non effugiet cruciatum.

Besides this general, Surius, p. 1031, 1034.
the Emperor sent a particular copy of his Edict, (Divinae Jussionis)
concerning his ratification of this general Synod, to the Synod at Rome,
whereupon, Pope Agatho being dead, and Leo the second succeeding him, writ this
Epistle ad Constantinum piissimum August: by way of gratitude, most clearly
demonstrating his supreme Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, care of Religion and of
his Subjects souls, as well as of their bodies and estates. Regi Regum in cujus
potestate sunt Regna mundi pusilli, cui magnas gratias agimus, qui ita in vobis
terrenum contulit Regnum, ut coelestia vos magis ambire concederet. Pius est
enim, quod in Deo defixa mente confiditis, quam quod de collato vobis Divinitus
honor regnatis. Illud enim vobis, hoc proficit omnino subiectis. Nam
triumphalem Paterni Diadematis gloriam nascendo superna miseratione obtinetis,
pietas enim vestrae, fructus misericordiae est: potestas autem, Custos est
disciplinae. Per illa igitur regia men's Deo jungitur, per istam vero censura
subditis adhibetur; illius opes inopes adjuvant, hujus autem sagacitas a vero
tramite deviantes emendat. Non enim minor regnantium cura est, prava corrigere,
quam de adversariis triumphare, quia ei nimirum potestatem suam serviendo
subjiciunt, cujus profecto munere et protectione imperare noscuntur. Vnde
divinitus praeordinata vestra Christianissima pietas, and habitaculum
dignissimum Sancti Spiritus in sui cordis arcano praeparans, quando Caput
Ecclesiae Dominum Jesum Christum, verae pietatis regulam amplectendo, concessi
sibi ab eo Regni demonstrat authorem, Sanctum venerabile corpus ejus, quae est
Sancta Matter Ecclesia, ut syncerus et principalis filius, largiendo atque
fovendo inconcussa facit soliditate gaudere. Scriptum est igitur de vobis
Clementissime Principum, Isa. 49
and de eadem Sancta Ecclesia toto terrarum orb diffusa; Erunt (inquit) Reges
nutritii tui, Psalm 98.
pariterque scriptum est: Honor Regis judicium diligit, quia dum divina rebus
humanis praeponitis, et Orthodoxam fidem curis secularibus incomparabiliter
antefertis, quid aliud, quam judicium rectum Dei cultui mancipatis, et
sacrificium purissimum atque holocaustum divinae suavitatis odore flagrans, in
ara vestri pectoris ejus invisibili Majestati mactatis? Haec de piissimi animi
vestri proposito Christianissime Augustorum, efficaciter dici (Dei gratia
operante) confidimus, qua sola and error omnis evictus est, and rectitudo
Evangelicae atque Apostolicae fidei cum syncera charitatis copula apud cunctos
Ecclesiarum Christi praesules obtinetur. Then at large declaring his
approbation of this general Synods Confession of Faith, he thus closes his
Epistle: Ibid. p. 103^.
Vicit novus David constantissimus Augustorum non in millibus solum, (nec enim
generalem Evangelicae prae^icationis victoriam numerorum vinculis quisquam
poterit comprehendere) sed and ipsum Principem, and hostem, and Ducem, ac
incentorem omnium malorum and errorum Diabolum, cum suis legionibus atque
fautoribus, per arma verae atque Orthodoxae Apostolicae traditionis and
confessionis extinxit. Exulta nunc secura Sancta Matter Ecclesia, de liberatate
tua saepius impugnata, sed non derelicta. Suscitavit Rex tuus invictissimus
Christianorum Principem propugnatorem tuum, benefactorem tuum atque
opulentissimum largitorem, cujus studio Orthodoxa fides recollecto splendore
toto orb irradiat, fideles omnes gratiam referentes exultant; infideles maeror
atque dejectio comprimit et confundit; Ecclesiae Christi de cunctis
oppressionibus liberatae, respirant, donis imperialibus confoventur, principali
praesidio muniuntur, quibus et domesticis verbis augusta vestra benignitas
Christum imitando pollicetur: Matthew. 28.
Ecce, ego vobiscum sum usque ad consummationem saeculi, ut Domini nostri Jesu
Christi, cujus exemplis utitur, aterna ejus Regni perenni gloria patiatur, and
in orbem terrarum generaliter atque perenniter ejus imperium dilatetur.
Piissimum Domini Imperium gratia superna custodiat, et ei omnium gentium colla
substernat. Data Nonis Maiis indictione Decima.

As Pope Leo thus acknowledges, applaudeth this Emperors care, zeal to
promote, protect, propagate the Orthodox Faith; and professors thereof,
suppress all Heresies, and his supremacy in and over all Ecclesiastical
persons and causes; so likewise Surius Council. Tom. 2. p. 896, 897.
Mansuetus Archbishop of Millain, with all his Clergy, thus acknowledged the
Emperors Ecclesiastical supremacy, Hereditary descent, and right to summon
general Councils. Domino Serenissimo atque Tranquillissimo, and a Deo Coronato
Religiosissimo Constantino Imperatori, Mansuetus Mediolanensis Metropolitanae
Ecclesiae indignus Episcopus, vel universa San^la Episcoporum fraternitas, quae
in hac magna, Regia Vrbe convenit, aeternam in Domino salutem. Si apicem
Imperialis fastigii et infulas sacratissimae potestatis; avis et proavis
vestris caelitus attributum cognovimus, et pro meritorum actibus ad vos
propagatum scimus, dignum est his vos aequiperare vestigiis, quorum et
celsitudinem obtinetis. Nec disparilia debent esse instrumenta coelestia, ubi
paria possidentur Sceptra Regalia. Aemulari ergo oportet eorum Magisterium,
quorum documenta permanent salutaria, etc. Habes quippe probatissime Imperator
specula, in quibus tuas actiones imaginari debeas. Then reciting the acts and
piety of Constantine the Great, in summoning the Council of Nice against the
Arrians; of Theodosius in convening the Council of Constantinople against
Macedonius; of Martianus and Justinian the Emperors in calling the Councils of
Ephesus, Chalcedon, and Constantinople against Eutiches, Dioscorus, and other
Heretics; they subjoyn, Haec Gloriosissime Princeps antiquorum Patrum statuta,
una cum consensu Piissimorum Imperatorum definita, quae convelli vel infirmari
nulla ratione pietas vestra permittat, etc.

This godly Emperor Constantine deceasing before this Synod ended, Anno 679.
Justinianus the 2d. his son, Surius Tom. 2. 1034.
succeeding him, confirmed the confession of the Faith, and resolutions of this
general Council, by his Divine Decree, directed to Pope John the 5th. wherein
are these observable passages, displaying his Ecclesiastical supremacy, care of
Religion, the Orthodox Faith, and his peoples souls; and enjoining not only the
Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, Clergy, but all his Military Officers,
Commanders, Curators, and civil Magistrates, throughout all parts of his Empire
to subscribe the confession of Faith therein accorded, which were read before,
and then subscribed by them in the Emperors presence. Magnum studium, magnam
sollicitudinem nos habentes pro stabilitate immaculatae Christianorum fidei,
dehinc namque Clementissimum nostrum Deum adjutorem et susceptorem nostrae
serenitatis esse confidimus, adversus omnem inimicum Christo dilectae nostrae
Reipublicae dum cognitum est nobis, quia Synodalia gesta, eorumque
definitionem, quam et instituere noscitur Sanctum Sextum Concilium, quod
congregatum est in tempore Sanctae memoriae nostri Patris, in hanc a Deo
conservandam Regiam Vrbem apud quosdam nostros Iudices remiserunt. Neque enim
omnino praevidimus alterum aliquem apud se detinere ea, sine nostra piissima
serenitate, eo quod nos Copiosa.

custodes constituit ejusdem immaculatae Christianorum fidei, sed mox addurimus

This whole General Synod in their Oration to Justinian, inprimis pium
Imperatorem, use these expressions to him, evidencing that God had specially
raised him up to defend, preserve, propagate the Orthodox says, and that it
was, yea ought to be his first and principal care, trust, duty, to reclaim his
Subjects from sin, and endeavor to promote the salvation of their souls, as
well as their temporal welfare. Surius, Tom. 2. p. 1038, 1039.

in judicio, in seculum veritatem servantem, facientem judicium and justitiam in
medio terrae, and in via ab omni culpa ac reprehensione aliena procedentem,
quem cum sapientia concepisset, eique obstetricis officium praestitisset,

populorum qui sunt sub ejus manibus perfectionem et aedificationem, qui ruo in
Deum desiderii ardore Phinees zelum superas, et pietatis ac prudentiae robore
confosso peccato, gregem quoque vitio et eritio subtrahere voluisti. Oportebat
enim eum qui post supernum monumentum humani generis gubernaculum suscepisset,
non solum id quod ad se pertinet considerare, et quomodo sua a se vita
dirigatur; sed et omnes quibus imperat, et maximis fluctibus servare, et a
multa prolapsionum errorumque confusione, undique obruentibus improbitatis
fluctibus, et humilitatis nostrae corpus perturbantibus, eripere. After which
they thus humbly pray the Emperor to ratify their Canons to make them valid
and obligatory. Propterea ergo tuae pietatis jussu in hac Dei observatrice and
Imperante Urbe congressi, sacros Canones scripsimus. Quamobrem tuam pietatem,
eas quae prius in hac Dei observatrice Civitate a congrega^^s sub bonae
memoriae Imperatore nostro patribus editae sunt, voces Tibi adducentes, ut

transmittat, and terrenae quoque potentiae adjiciat, ut etiam coelesti regno
fruaris. Which he ratified accordingly.

Gratian, Anno 680
ex gestis Romanorum Pontificum, records this memorable Decree made by the
Emperor Constantinus P^gonatus in the time of Pope Agatho, about the year 680.
Agatho, Natione Siculus, cujus legatione functus Joannes Episcopus Portuensis,
die Dominico octavo Paschae in Ecclesia sanctae Sophiae, missas coram Principe
and Patriarcha latin celebravit. Hic suscepit ab eo divalem, id est, Regiam
Epistolam secundum suam postulationem; per quam relevata est quantitas
pecuniae, quae solita erat dari (Imp.) pro ordinatione Pontificis facienda; sic
tamen ut si contigerit post ejus transitum electionem fieri, non debeat
ordinari qui electus fuerit, nisi prius Decretum generale introducetur in
regiam urbem, secundum ANTIQUAM CONSUETUDINEM, ut cum eorum conscientia et
jussione debeat ordinatio prosperare. Item Vitalianus Natione Segnensis (Ann.
665) direxit responsales suos cum Synodica Epistola, JUXTA CONSUETUDINEM, in
regiam urbem apud piissimos Principes de Ordinatione sua; To which Gratian

Imperatori Constantinopoli; et tunc temporis electus dabat quandam summam
pecuniae Imperatori. Ad quam summam relevandam misit Agatho Joannem Episcopum
Portuensem Constantinopolim; qui in octavo Paschae in Ecclesia Sanctae Sophiae,
latin missam coram Patriarcha and Principe celebravit; et ad suam petitionem
accepit Imperiale scriptum, per quod solita quantitas est ei relaxata, ita
tamen (mark it) ut electio Pontificis Imperatori semper repraesentaretur, et
cum Imperatoris conscientia et jussione, Pontificis ordinatio deberet prospere
fieri: (or as Anastatius records it, sic tamen ut si contigerit post ejus
transitum electionem fieri, non debeat ordinari qui electus fuerit, nisi prius
decretum generale introducatur in Regiam urbem SECUNDUM ANTIQUAM CONSUETUDINEM,
and CUM Ejus Imperatoris.

and should be omitted, as the sense and context evidence.
(a) Papa hanc consuetudinem tolli, quia continebat speciem mali, ut. 1. qu. 1.

Confessions, 1. That no Pope could be elected at Rome without the Emperors
privity. 2ly. That his election ought to be certifyed by an instrument in
writing sent to Constantinople (when the Emperor resided there) and the
Emperors assent expressly given to his Election, and also a certain sum of money
paid by him to the Emperor, before he ought to be admitted or consecrated Pope.
3ly. That the Emperor ought to issue out an express command for his
consecration. 4ly. That this was no innovation, but an ancient known Custom and
usage even in Pope Agathoes and Vitalians time, within 650. years after Christ.
5ly. That this was a lawful Right vested in the Emperors, which they never
parted with by this Decree, though they mitigared or released the fine or
first fruits, paid upon every new election of a Pope. Therefore the subsequent
grants made by Pope Adrian and Leo the 3. to the Emperor Charles the Great and
his successors, to elect the Pope, etc. gave them no new right, but were only a
preservation of their ancient right used time out mind before. Which will put a
period to the Popes late Here p. 35, to 40.

Magd. 7. c. 9.
whereto he summoned Omnes in commune religiosos Provinciarum Rectores and
Clarissimorum ordinum totius Hispaniae, and illustres aulae regiae viros, who
sat and voted therein as well as his Bishops. In the beginning of this Council
the King making a short, pious Oration to them, declaring how destructive all
sins were to Kingdoms, if not corrected by severe Laws; and how much true faith
and piety did advance, secure, honor both Kings and Kingdoms; with his desire
to consecrate the beginning of his reign to God, by promoting the one, and
suppressing the other: He delivered them a writing containing the sum of what
he desired to settle in this Council, with these expressions. Ecce in brevi
complexa vel exarata devotionis meae negotia in hujus tomo complicationis
agnoscenda perlegite, perlecta discutite, discussa elimatis and discretis
titulorum sententiis definite; ut pura et placens Deo vestrarum definitionum
valitura discretio, and regni nostri primordia decoret exhortatione justitiae,
and errores plebium digna cohibeat severitatis censura. Whereupon they
receiving the writing, inserted into the Acts of this Council, pursued it
accordingly in their proceedings. First, they began with a public Confession
of their faith agreeable to that of Nice, and former Councils. After which they
added 13 Chapters more: The 1. whereof declares and confirms the Kings just
Title to the Crown; prohibiting from thenceforth all attempts against his Title
or Government by word or deed; the other Canons concern the Jews, Religion, and
Ecclesiastical affairs: which they clozed with a devout prayer for the King,
regnare feliciter, habere de clementia fructum, obtinere de justitia proemium,
de pietate trophaeum, etc. the Bishops and Nobles too subscribing them: This
King afterward ratified them by his royal Decree signed with his own hand;
commanding them not to be contemned, omitted, violated, subverted by any, but
punctually, inviolably, and perpetually observed by all his Subjects under pain
of excommunication, confiscation of the tenth part of their goods who had any,
and fifty stripes with perpetual infamy to be inflicted on such who had no
goods to forfeit.

consisting of all his Nobles and Great Officers, Surius Council. Tom: 3. p. 9,

as well as Bishops, to whom he made a pious short speech, and then delivered
them a writing containing in gross the things he called them to consult of,
and to digest into particular Titles, which they accordingly pursued; the first
part of them concerned the forfeiture and confiscations of his Subjects, and
the Nobility; the later, Church affairs; All these Councils of Toledo were like
our ancient Saxon Councils, consisting of the Nobility and Clergy, and enacting
temporal as well as Ecclesiastical Laws, which the King confirmed by his
Subscription and Edicts. They began with a Confession of faith; because
Praeconabile fignum est, illis semper negotiis interesse, quae and a pietate
incipiunt, and per pietatis viscera temperantur; 1 Timothy 4.

Conon being elected Pope after John's death by the joint consent of the Clergy,
Army, and people of Rome, (who were at first divided, the Clergy electing
Peter, and the Army Theodorus a Priest:) they all ut mos est, Anno 686
sent their instrument of his election subscribed with their hands, by some of
the Clergy and people, to Theodorus the Exarch for his approbation; without
which he had not been admitted to the Papacy. Where this Pope received Divalem
jussionem Domini Justiniani Principis, for confirmation of the 6. General Synod
of Constantinople held by his Father; quam Synodum permisit ejus pietas illis
palam and inconcussam perenniter custodire and conservare.

After the death of Conon, Anno 687
the Clergy and People of Rome being divided in their election of a Pope, one
part choosing Theodorus, another Paschal, both obstinately maintaining their
parties; at last the greater part of the Soldiers and Clergy elected Sergius,
and in sacrosanctum palatium, and exinde in Lateranense Episcopium deduxerunt;
whereupon Theodorus gave over his pretense, and submitted to Sergius his
election; but Paschal would by no means do it, till enforced at last volens
nolens; sending privily to John Platyn the Exarch of Ravenna, to come to Rome
with his Judges, whither he marched very privately: who forced Sergius to give
him not only diverse Ornaments antienly hanging before St. Peter's Altar; but
also One hundred pounds weight of gold, to confirm his election and purchase
his peace. If Popes were thus subject to the Emperors Exarchs and chief
Officers in Italy; much more then to the Emperors themselves.

Emperor Justinian An. 710. commanded Theudor his General to apprehend Felix
Archbishop of Ravenna, Anno 710
and send him prisoner to Constantinople for his offenses, which being
accordingly executed, he had his eyes put out, and was afterward banished into
Pontica; At which time this Emperor sent an Imperial Edict to Pope Constantine,
per quam jussit eum ad regiam ascendere urbem (Constantinople) qui jussis
Imperialibus attemperans, illico navigia fecit parari, and went to
Constantinople: the Emperor being then at Nice, commanded him to meet him at
Nicomedia, which he did: where the next Lords day he said Mass, and
administered the Communion to the Emperor. The Emperor there renewing all the
Privileges of the Church, gave this Pope leave to return again to Rome. After
which Anastatius the Emperor sent a second Edict by the Exarch of Italy to
Rome, per quam verae se orthodoxa fidei praedicatorem, and sancti Sexti
Concilii confessorem esse omnibus declaravit.

Leo Isaurus in the 9th year of his reign, Anno 718
published a Decree against Images, Ut nulla Imago cujustibet Sancti; aut
Martyris, aut Angeli ubicunque haberetur, maledicta enim omnia asserebat:
sending word to Rome to Pope Gregory the 2d. Si acquiesceret in hoc Pontifex,
gratiam Imperatoris haberet; Si et hoc fieri praepediret, a suo gradu
decideret, that he would degrade him from the Papacy, as he deposed Heraclius
Patriarch of Constantinople, for dissuading, opposing his suppressing, defacing
of Images, and refusing to subscribe his Decree against them; making Anastatius
Patriarch in his stead; who concurred with him against Images. This Pope
Gregory instead of obeying the Emperor herein: Tributa Romanae Vrbis prohibuit,
et Italiae, scribens ad Leonem Epistolam dogmaticam non oportere Imperatorem de
fide facere verbum: (a falsehood in the highest degree, against all his
Predecessors doctrine, unless qualified with the ensuing words in a right
sense and subject, here misapplyed) and novitate violare antiqua dogmata
Ecclesiae Catholicae. And to preserve himself in his See, he mutinied all the
Officers and Soldiers in Rome and Italy against the Emperor, so far as to
resolve to march to Constantinople to depose him, and choose another Emperor in
his place, upon this quarrel of Images, Zonaras Tom. 3. in Leone. Cent. Magd.

Some write, that Pope Gregory the 2d. excommunicated the Emperor Leo in a
Synod at Rome, and that the Emperor derided his excommunication, saying,
Idolatra est, et ipse excommunicatus a Deo: However all accord, that he removit
Romam and Italiam, necnon and omnia tam Reipublicae quam Ecclesiastica jura in
Hesperiis ab obedientia Imperatoris (as Paulus Diaconus and others express it)
Leonem per Epistolas tanquam impie agentem redarguens, and Romam cum tota
Italia ab illius Imperio recedere faciens: whereupon the Emperor appointed
several of his Officers in Italy to apprehend, depose or kill him for his
Treasons; whom he by mutinies caused to be slain themselves. Oration 2. De
Imaginibus, p. 736.
John Damascen, a Monk, opposed the Emperor in Syria, writing in defense of
Images; Regum est civilis administratio: We obey thee, O King, in things that
belong to civil and secular affairs, quantum ad nos spectat, the government
whereof is committed to you; But in Ecclesiastical matters, Pastors and Bishops
have delivered Laws and Constitutions to us; We may not remove those lawful
bounds which are set unto us; Anno 733
as if their Canons or Decrees were of absolute force to bind Kings or Emperors
without their consents, which they never did. This Emperor proceeded to put
many Priests as well as others to death in Constantinople and elsewhere, who
presumed to erect Images, and disobeyed his Imperial Edicts. Hereupon Pope

from his opinion and proceedings against Images and the defenders of them,
sending them by special Messengers, who were apprehended, their Letters taken
from them, and they imprisoned for sundry months, then sent away with
reproaches by the Emperor. An Argument of this Emperors Supremacy, and the
Popes subjection to him.

to do. Aistulphus King of the Lombards demanding an annual Tribute from the
Citizens of Rome, Per unumquodque scilicet caput singulos auri solidos annue
inferri, and threatening to besiege the City if they refused to pay it; Pope
Stephen the 3d. his successor, quem cunctus populus consona voce sibi elegit
Pontificem (not the Clergy alone) when he could not pacify Aistulphus, neither
by his Petitions, nor Gifts sent unto him by his Ambassadors; (obnixe per eas
postulavit pacis foedera,) He thereupon sent to Constantinople to the Emperor
Constantinus, entreating Imperialem clementiam, ut cum exercitu ad tuendas
Italiae parts, modis omnibus adveniret, and de iniquitatis filiis mansolas,
Romanam hanc urbem, vel cunctam Italiam liberaret. But receiving no aid thence,
and Aistulphus proceeding in his menaces and Invasions upon the Popes
Territories; he thereupon writ humble Letters, and sent Messengers to Pepin and
Charles Kings of France, to relive them from their oppressions. Afterward,
this Pope repaired in person to King Aistulphus to Papiae; where presenting him
with many rich gifts, nimis eum obsecratus est atque lachrymis profusis eum
petivit, ut dominicas quas abstulerat redderet over, and propria propriis
restitueret; sed nullo modo apud eum haec impetrare valuit. Sed and imperialis
missus simisi modo petiit, and Imperiales literas illi tribuit, and non
obtinere potuit. Herupon he petitioned Aistulphus (who detained him prisoner)
that he would grant him leave to go into France; telling him, Si tua voluntas
est me relaxandi, mea omnino est ambulandi, etc. Upon which he released and
permitted him to walk into France; where coming to King Pipin and Charles his
son, Christianissimum Regem lachrymabiliter deprecatus est, ut per pacis
foedera causam beati Petri and Reipublicae Romanorum disponeret: (having writ a
Letter to them before in Stephani 3. Epist: 3 and 4. Gent. Magd. 8: c. 10. col.
707, to 740.
St. Peter's and all the Saints, Martyrs, and blessed Virgins names, exhorting,
praying, conjuring them to help St. Peter and the Church of Rome in this
emergent necessity.) Who thereupon treated with Aistulphus, and discovering his
fraudulent shifts, tota se virtute professus est decertare pro causa Sanctae
Dei Ecclesiae; whereupon he marched with an Army into Italy, besieged Papia,
and forced Aistulphus to surrender all the Cities, Lands he had taken from the
Church of Rome, De quibus omnibus receptis Civitatibus Rex Pipinus donationem
in scriptis a beato Petro, atque a Sancta Romana Ecclesia, vel omnibus in
perpetuum Pontificibus Apostolicae (edis misit possidendum, asserens and hoc,
quod nulla eum copia, etc. suadere valeret, ut quod simel beato Petro obtulit,
auferret. Thus he restored this Pope to his See and possessions (who had
crowned him King of France against right) upon what Terms you shall hear anon,
from some of his Successors. It is observable that there were no
Excommunications, Interdicts, Anathemas used against Aistulphus or others by
this Pope, to force them to obedience, which succeeding Popes introduced; but
only humble prayers, supplications, tears, Petitions both to Aistulphus, Pipin,
and Charles, (as the Popes Superiors, not his Underlings and Vassals,) and that
for St. Peter's Patrimony.

Pope, whom many of them accompanying in their Arms in Lateranensem Patriarcham,
continuo accersito Georgio Episcopo, compulerunt cum ut ordinem Clericatus
eidem Constantino tribueret; who refusing at first to do it, they at last by
threats and force compelled him out of fear, to ordain him a Deacon and
Subdeacon at one time against the Sacred Canons: and enforced all the people to
take an Oath to him; the next Lords day bringing him with a multitude of armed
Soldiers into St. Peter's Church, he was there consecrated Pope by the said
George and two Bishops more. Et sic per anni spatium and mensem unum sedem
Apostolicam invasam detinuit. Which Christophorus and Sergius his son
bewailing, went to this Constantine, feining themselves to become Monks,
received an absolution of their Oath from him, and then departing privily to
Desiderius King of the Lombards, and Theodoric Duke of Spoletum, obnixe eundem
Regem deprecati sunt ejus auxilium tribui, ut talis novitatis error ab Ecclesia
Dei amputaretur. Whereupon they procuring forces from King Desiderius and
entering Rome by night, after very many contests, apprehended Pope Constanine as
an invader, uncanonically ordained. Then Christopherus Pannionus, aggregans
Sacerdotes ac Primates Cleri, and Optimates Militae atque universum exercitum,
and Cives honestos, omnisque populi Romani coetum a magno usque ad parvum,

Council at Rome, Constantine was deprived, degraded, as ordained against the
Canons, the Orders conferred by him whiles Pope, nulled, and the persons
ordained by him either thrust into Monasteries, as Monks, or re-ordained: only
the baptism conferred by them was reputed valid. After this, though Constantine
excused himself, that he was made Pope against his will by the People and
Soldiers, yet he was thrust Prisoner into a Monastery, and had his eyes there
put out by a party of Soldiers, of which he died. Afterward by the Council
and assistance of Duke Maurice and Desiderius King of Lombardy, one Michael
Schrivianus, qui nullo Sacerdotali fungebatur honor, was elected Archbishop of
Ravenna by the Officers and Army with a strong hand: whereupon this Pope sent
into France to King Charles, and by his assistance procured Michael to be
ejected out of his Bishopric, and sent Prisoner to Rome, and Leo an Archdeacon
to be chosen in his place, who was ordained and consecrated Archbishop at Rome
by Pope Stephen. Hereupon Desiderius seized some lands belonging to the Church
of Rome, and refused to restore them upon this Popes Petition, who thereupon
sent supplicatory Letters to King Charles and Charlemain into France for aid
against him. Upon which Desiderius marching into Rome with an Army, entered into
the Popes Palace and presence with armed Soldiers, shut him up in his Palace,
apprehended Christopherus and Sergius who set up this Pope, and notwithstanding
his intercessions on their behalf, put out their eyes, and thrust them into the
Monastery of St. Agatha and Clare Scauri, where they soon after died, and this
Pope too through grief.

Pope Adrian the 1. being elected Pope after him, Anno 772
Desiderius for fear of Charles and Charlemains entering into Italy, desired
Peace with him, promising with an Oath to do him all that right which he denied
unto Stephen; whereupon the Pope demanded the restitution of the City of
Faventia, the Dukedom of Ferrata, and other lands, quas sanctae memoriae
Pipinus Rex, and ejus filii Carolus and Carolomannus excellentissimi Reges
Francorum, and Patricii Romanorum, beato Petro concedentes, obtulerunt; who not
only refused to surrender them, but seized upon more. After many supplicatory
Letters for restitution, and treaties to that purpose spent in vain; Desiderius
threatened to besiege Rome it self; whereupon the Pope dispatched Letters and
Messengers to King Charles of France, his Patron, by Sea, deprecavit ejus
excellentiam, ut sicut suis Pater sanctae memoriae Pipinus, and ipse succurrer
at atque subveniat Sanctae Dei Ecclesiae atque afflictae Romanorum seu
Exarchatus Ravennentium provinciae, atque plenarias beati Petri justicias and
ablatas Civitates ab eodem Desiderio Rege exigeret. Whereupon Charles by his
Messengers, exhorted him to restore all these Cities and Territories to the
Church: who after many Messages and Treaties, gave this peremptory answer, Se
minime quicquam redditurum. King Charles hereupon marched with a great Army into
Italy, admonishing Desiderius without any battle, peaceably to restore those
Cities and Lands to the Church, who yet refused to do it. After which
Desiderius flying, and all his forces being dispersed, the Cities and
Territories craving pardon, returned to their obedience to the Church of Rome,
and took an Oath to continue faithful to it. Charles having reduced all Places
and Territories to their obedience, took his journey to Rome it self, beyond
the Popes expectation: Anno 772.
where being magnificently entertained, he made a New Grant and Donation of all
the Lands formerly granted by Pepin to the Church of Rome, subscribed with his
own hand, and the hands of all the Bishops, Abbots, Dukes and Secretaries then
present. Then returning, he carried Desiderius and his wife Prisoners with him
into France.

This Pope Adrian, Anno 774. holding a Council at Rome, consisting of 153
Bishops and Abbots, by way of gratitude, decreed the right of electing the Pope
himself and all other Bishops, with their Investitures, and ordering the Roman
See, unto Charles and his Successors; thus recorded by Gratian himself,

Adrianus autem Papa cum universali Synodo tradiderunt Carolo, Ius et
Potestatem eligendi Pontificem, et ordinandi Apostolicam sedem: dignitatem
quoque Patriciatus ipsi concesserunt. Insuper, Archiepiscopos et Episcopos per
singulas Provincias ab eo investituras accipere diffinivit; ut nisi a Rege
laudetur et investiatur Episcopus, a nemine consecretur; et quicunque contra
hoc Decretum ageret, anathematis vinculo eum innodavit, et nisi resipisceret
bona ejus publicari praecepit. In which Decree these things are very
observable: 1. That this Council even in Rome it self, was called, constituted
by Charles, the Great, whiles Kings of France, before he was crowned Emperor.
2ly. That it granted to him no new thing, but an ancient right belonging to the
Roman Emperors; to wit the right, power of electing the Pope himself, and
ordering the Sea Apostolic. 3ly. It granted him the dignity of a Patricius, or
Protector of Rome. 4ly. That all Archbishops and Bishops in all Provinces
(therefore in France and in Spain, as the Gloss observes, as well as other
places) should receive their investitures from the Emperor alone. 5ly. That
none of them shall be recommended, invested, or consecrated a Bishop by any
person, unless first recommended and invested a Bishop by the King. 6ly. That
whosoever should transgress this Decree, shall not only be excommunicated, but
also forfeit his goods, unless he repented. What greater evidence for his
absolute regal Supremacy over the Pope and all other Archbishops and Bishops in
Ecclesiastical matters, then this Councils Decree held in Rome it self, and
ratified by the Pope himself in St. Peter's pretended unerring chair?

2d. Synod of Nice was summoned by the Decree of Constantine and Irene, Anno 787
as the Prologue to it attests, Imperantibus piissimis and Christo deditissimis
Dominis nostris, cum matre sua Irene, per pium illorum Imperatorum sancte Orbem
terrarum gubernantum Decretum congregata est. And in their Epistles to the
Bishops, (divina voluntate, et nostra gratia jussuque sacrati nostri Imperii
congregatis in Nicena Synodo:) treating of the benefits received by Christ's
incarnation, and his imperial office and duty, they assert: Jesus Christus
primus factus summus Sacerdos, hujus appellationis reddidit NOS consortes, O
viri Sacerdotes, etc. Hanc igitur ob beatitudinem quae nobis donataest,
nobilitatisque causa qua Deus nos adoptavit, Imperatoria nostra and pia
Majestas ad concordiam et pacem universum Romanum Imperium erigere contendens,
praecipue tamen sanctarum Dei nostri Ecclesiarum statum, qua possumus cura et
consilio conservare intendimus. After which they granted all assembled in this
Synod this Liberty. Damus quoque unicuique libertatem, ut sine omni formidine
eloquatur, quae secum animo deliberavit, quo veritas magis magisque elucescat:
et intrepiva voce audiatur. Then speaking of Tharaseus Patriarch of
Constantinople, who often refused to accept that office when elected to it, as
too heavy for his shoulders, omnibus libertatem dedimus, ut si quid adversus
virum haberent, dicerent, ut purgare sese posset. After they direct, that the
Letters of Pope Adrian should first be read in the Synod, Post id etiam duas
quaterniones umbelicas conclusas legetis, etc. ut per (...) cognoscatis,
quaenam sit Catholicae Ecclesiae sententia and judicium. Sancta Synodus
respondit: Servet Deus Imperium eorum, producat illorum tempora Deus, augeat
Dominos eos gratia. Then they proceeded according to their instructions. When
Surius, p. 65.
Tharasius President of this Synod would have caused another Book to be read
before Pope Adrians Letter, contrary to the Emperors direction, Leontius
gloriosissimus, Imperatori a Secretis, dixit, Sacra and a Deo collecta Synodus
meminerit, in priore conventione, D^i obserantium magnorum Imperatorum
nostrorum fuisse lectas literas, in quibus mentio fiebat sanctissimi and
beatissimi Archiepiscopi veteris Romae, et religiosissimorum Pontificum
Orientis Synodicarum literarum, quas in duabus quaternionibus adducimus (which
they ordered to be read first) de quibus vos, quid fieri vultis, admonemus?
Sancta Synodus dixit, Legantur libelli beatissimi and sanctissimi Archiepiscopi
veteris Romae. Et legit eos Nicephorus gloriosissimus ab Imperialibus secretis.
The Emperors Great Officers and Privy Counselors being present in this Synod,
directed the proceedings therein, as these passages, and Ibid. 72, 78, 91, 127.
praesentibus simul and audientibus Illustrissimis juxta ac magnificentissimis
Senatoribus, nimirum Petronio glorioso exconsule Patricio, and Theophilacto
Comite Imperialis obsequii, Joanne regio ostiario, etc. with others there named
evidence. Pope Adrians Letters there read, are thus directed, Surius, p. 64,
65, 69.
Dominis piissimis et serenissimis Victoribus, etc. Constantino et Irenae
Augustis, Adrianus Servus servorum Dei. In the beginning of his Epistle he
writes, Deus in Ecclesiae suae faciem respiciens, pietatem vestram and
praedestinatam Serenitatem Imperatoriae mansuetudinis, ad profectionem fidei
vocare non dedignatus est, quo omnem emendari improbitatem PER VOS contigat,
veritatemque in lucem perducat. Then he subjoyns, Quemadmodum enima
Superioribus haereseos schismatibus eramus conterrefacti; ita nunc rursum per
vestram jussionem (their summons to him) exultatione sumus perfusi: nam in
regia vestra Civitate venerandum Imaginum causa jussistis retractari, etc.
Nuper vero per piam vestram jussionem de voluntate vestra instructi,
Omnipotenti Deo pro vestro imperio precibus solicitantes, gratiarum action
gloriam istius praedicamus. Illud autem in stabilimentum and confirmationem
regni vestri maxim fit, quod magnum opus hoc aggressi estis, quod sine
mediatione vestra in hoc mundo vix fieri potest, etc. Vos autem partem
habebatis cum eo, qui nunc in divina requiescit, Constantino Imperatore, and
Helena ejus matre, qui orthodoxam fidem illustrarunt et confirmarunt, adeoque
sanctam matrem vestram catholicam et spiritualem, Romanam Ecclesiam exaltarunt,
ut plane spes sit, eorum piam appellationem in vestra cognomenta piissima et a
Deo data, transituram, ut per omnem terrarum orbem novus Constantinus, et nova
Helena praedicetur, per quos sancta Catholica et Apostolica Ecclesia
renovabitur, etc. After which relating the story of Constantines baptism; he
adds, Non immemor accepti beneficii Ecclesias aedificare coepit, etc. nec alia
de causa, quam ut Christianissimum in lucem et veritatem, ubique multum
proveheret, et omnes gentes a cultu idolorum et diabolica deceptione
converteret; which he esteemed his bounden duty. This Pope clozeth his Epistle
with this submissive supplication: Ibid. p. 69.
Obsecrantes igitur ex animi fervore vestram mansuetudinem attestando, et
veluti praesentes genibus advoluti, et coram vestigiis pedum volutando; ego cum
fratribus meis coram Deo supplico, obtestor, adjuro, sacras Imagines in ipsa
Regia Vrbe, et in utrisque Graeciae partibus in pristinum statum restitui et
firmari jubeatis. In this Council there are Surius, Ibid. p. 83, 90. 138, 197.
many passages concerning the propagation, defense, protection of the Orthodox
faith, religion, and suppression of heresies by Christian Emperors; and these
frequent Acclamations, Prayers for Constantine and Irene, who summoned and
directed this Council, Multi anni Imperatoribus, Constantino and Irenae magnis
Regibus: Orthodoxis Imperatoribus multi anni. Custodes fidei Domine protegas:
Propugnatores Ecclesiae Domine confirma. Novi Constantini et novae Helenae
aeterna memoria: pacificam vitam da illis Domine. Amen. As this Pope, so Ibid.
p. 187, 188.
Tharasius Patriarch of Constantinople, in his Epistle to Constantine and
Irene, written from, and in the name of this Synod, styles them: Vniversi
Populi Christiani Principes ac Duces; ad pietatem veritate Sermonem
contulistis, et orthodoxae fidei pietatisque figuram descripsistis. Vnde
fidelibus tanquam faces ardentes relucetis, et periclitanti Ecclesiae manum
porrexistis. Nam et sanas doctrinas conservatis, et dissidentium unanimiter
concordiam gubernatis: pietatis officia per vos sunt stabilitata: Quamobrem,
Psalm 125
Os noster impletum est gaudio, and lingua nostra exultatione. Quid enim
splendidius magnificentiusque esse posset Principi, quam Ecclesiasticarum
constitutionum firmitatem et stabilimentum integrum conservavisse, etc? Neque
putastis ferendum aut tolerabile, quod in reliquis omnibus rebus been inter nos
conveniret, de vitae autem vestrae summa et praecipuo, nimirum fide et pace
Ecclesiae inter nos essent dissidia; maxim cum nostrum caput Vnicum sit
Christus, (not the Pope) nos autem deinceps illius unius corporis membra,
propter eam quae inter nos communem fidem et sententiam.

but adoration of Images, and Elepandus Archbishop of Toledo in Spain having
broached an heretical Opinion concerning the Sonship of Christ; thereupon King
Charles the Great, Anno 794. summoned a Councila t Frankford, to which Abbot
Alchuinus was called, who writ Alchuini Opera, col. 901 to 1007.
several Treatises against Elepandus. The Acts whereof begin thus, Sacro
incitante spiritu, ac zelo fidei Catholicae scintillatim subfervescente,
clementissimi and tranquillissimi gloriosique Caroli Regis, Domini terrae,
Imperii ejus decreto per diversas provincias regni ejus ditioni subjecta,
multitudo Antistitum sacris obtemperando praeceptis, in uno collegio adgregata
convenit. When they were sat, praecipiente and Praesidente piissimo and
gloriosissimo Domino nostro Carolo Rege, (Charles being not only present, but
President in that Synod) jubente Rege, Elepandus his Epistle being read with a
loud voice; the King thereupon made a long Oration against it; and then
demanded, Quid vobis videtur? Cumque impetrata et concessa esset invisa dilatio
per dies aliquot, placuit ejus mansuetudini, ut unusquisque quicquid Ingenii
captu rectius sentire potuisset, per sacras syllabas die statuto ejus
clementiae oblatum, deferret. Whereupon Paulinus Bishop of Aquilegia and others
tendered a refutation of Elepandus his Opinion, in the cloze whereof they made a
large Prayer to God for King Charles his prosperous success, and peaceable
Government of the Church and Kingdom, and use these expressions: Sit Dominus et
Pater, sit REX and SACERDOS, sit omnium Christianum moderatissimus gubernator,
auxiliante Domino nostro Jesus Christo, etc. After which follows an Surius,
Ibid. p. 237, 247, 248, etc.
Epistle of all the Bishops of Germany, France, Aquitain, and other places met
in this Synod, to the Bishops and Clergy of Spain, reciting their Summons by
King Charles, Domini Regis nostri, praecipua pietate et laudabili sapientia
adsedente et auriliante Nobis; by whose direction and assistance they had read,
debated, and refuted Elepandus his Epistle: Then follows this Kings own Epistle
to Elepandus, and the Clergy of Spain, with this inscription, Carolus Gratia
Dei Rex Francorum, and Longobardorum, ac Patricius Romanorum, Filius and
Defensor Sanclae Dei Ecclesiae, etc. Wherein he refutes Elepandus his Opinion,
makes a large, pious, Orthodox Consession of his faith, in imitation of
Constantine the Great: adding, Hanc igitur fidem orthodoxam, and ab Apostolicis
traditam doctoribus, and ab univer^ali servatam Ecclesia, Nos pro unione
nostrarum partium utique in omnibus SERVARE and PRAEDICARE PROFITEMUR, quia non
est in alia aliqua salus, nisi in illa. Exhorting them to return to the Church,
and embrace this faith; Habetote Nos cooperatores salutis vestrae, Catholicae
pacis auriliares, etc. In this Council he likewise Regino. Abbas Vspergensis
Chron: p. 270. Surius Council. Tom: 3. p 220. Cent: Magd. 8 c. 9. col: 640, to

condemned the adoration of Images, against the Epistle and resolution of Pope
Adrian, and the Council of Nice, which this Council revoked, as neither
ecumenical, nor as any thing: ut nec septima, nec aliquid diceretur, quasi
supervacua ab omnibus abdicata est, writes Abbas Uspergensis.

Our famous Countryman Flaccus Alchuinus Abbas, Anno 796
(Scholar to our Venerable Beda, and Tutor to the Emperor Charles the Great,)
thus defines, describes the Office, duty of a Epistola 29 col. 1539, 1540
King, with the care he ought to have of the Orthodox Faith, Church, Religion,
and Ecclesiastical affairs, asserting the Emperors Supremacy over the Church
and Pope himself; Regis est, omnes iniquitates, pietatis suae potentia
opprimere, etc. Ecclesiarum Christi sint defensores et tutores, ut servorum Dei
orationibus longa vivant prosperitate. In his Epistola 1. to King Charles the
Great, (to whom he usually directed his Epistles under the style of, a Deo
dilecto, atque a Deo electo David Regi, pouring out many fervent thanksgivings
and prayers to God for him both in Verse and Prose) he writes, Tota sancta Dei
Ecclesia unanimo charitatis concentu gratias agere Deo omnipotenti debebit; Qui
tam pium, prudentem and justum, his novissimis mundi and periculosissimis
temporibus, populo Christiano perdonavit clementissimo munere Rectorem et
Defensorem: qui prava corrigere, et recta corroborare, et sancta sublimare omni
intention studeat, et nomen Domini Dei excelsi per multa terrarum spatia
dilatare gaudeat, et Catholicae fidei lumen in extremis mundi partibus
incendere conetur. Haec est, O dulcissime David, gloria, laus, et merces tua in
judicio diei magni, etc. Epist. 11. he writes, Tres Personae altissimae in
mundo fuerunt; Apostolica sublimitas, quae beati Petri Principis Apostolorum
sedem Vicario munere regere solet. Alia est Imperialis dignitas, et secundae
Romae secularis potentia. Terna est Regalis dignitas, in qua vos Domini nostri
Jesus Christi dispensatio Rectorem Christiani populi disposuit, caeteris
praefatis dignitatibus potentia excellentiorem, sapientia clariorem, regni
dignitate sublimiorem. Col. 1462. 1502, 1503.
Ecce in te solo tota salus Ecclesiarum Christi inclinata recumbit. Tu vindex
scelerum; tu Rector errantium, tu Consolator merentium, tu exaltatio bonorum.
Nonne Romana in sede, ubi religio maximae pietatis quondam claruerit, ibi
extrema impietatis exempla emerserunt? Ipsi cordibus suis excaecati caput suum
excaecaverunt. Nec ibi timor Dei, nec sapientia, nec charitas esse videtur:
Then relating sundry abuses fit to be redressed both in Rome and elsewhere: he
infers, Ex his omnibus tibi plena scientia data est a Deo, ut per te sancta Dei
Ecclesia (not by the Pope) in populo Christiano regatur, exaltetur, et
conservetur. Epist. 12. he uses these expressions of this Charles. O
dulcissime decus populi Christiani! O defensio Ecclesiarum Christi! consolatio
vitae praesentis. Quibus tuam beatitudinem omnibus necessarium est votis
exaltare, intercessionibus adjuvare, quatenus per vestram prosperitatem
Christianum tueatur Imperium, fides Catholica defendatur, justitiae regula
omnibus innotescat. Ecce quid actum est de Apostolica sede in civitate
praecipua (Roma) in dignitate excellentissima, quae omnia vestro tantummodo
servantur judicio (not to the Popes, nor Synods) ut prudentissimo consilio
sapientiae vobis a Deo datae, temperata consideratione corrigantur quae
corrigenda sunt, et conserventur quae conservanda sunt; et quae clementia
divina gessit pietas extollentur in laudem illius, qui salvum fecit servum
suum. Col. 1506, 1611, 1612, 1613, 1649.
Epist. 13. Vestra clarissima voluntas in hoc omni laboret studio, ut Christi

multis terrarum regnis innotescat; quatenus non solum magnitudo potestatis te
Regem ostendat, sed etiam instantia seminandi verbi Dei, in laud Domini nostri
Jesus Christi PRAEDICATOREM EFFICIAT. Ideo divina gratia his duobus mirabiliter
te ditavit muneribus, id est, terrenae foelicitatis imperio, et spiritalis
sapientiae latitudine, ut in utroque proficias, donec ad aeternae beatitudinis
pervenias foelicitatem: Parce populo Christiano, et Ecclesias Christi defend,
etc. Epist. 14. He adds, Sanctae religionis fervore omnibus praecellis. Felix
populi qui tali Principe gaudet; cujus solium dissipat iniquitatem. Nam quod
olim Apostolici Patres suis scriptis in confirmationem Fidei Catholicae,
diversis mundi partibus peragerunt; hoc vestra sanctissima sollicitudo implere
non cessat. Hoc mirabile et speciale in te, pietatis mi Domine praedicamus,
quod tanta devotione Ecclesias Christi a perfidorum doctrinis intrinsecus
purgare tuerique niteris; quanto forinsecus a Paganorum vastatione defendere
vel propagare curaris. His duobus gladiis (the two swords then by Gods
appointment belong to the Emperor, not the Pope) venerandam excellentiam dertra
levaque armavit divina Potentia: In quibus Victor laudabilis et Triumphator
gloriosus existis. His Epist. 24. to the same King Charles, has this Exordium;
Gloria and Laus Deo Omnipotenti pro salute and prosperitate vestra; Dulcissime
mi David, atque pro omni honor and sapientia, in quibus te speciali gratia
omnibus supercellere fecit. Perpetua gratiarum actio resonet, and assidua
sanctarum intercessio orationum ad Deum dirigatur, quatenus longaeva
prosperitate, feliciter vivas, valeas, et regnes, ad correctionem et
exaltationem sanctae suae Ecclesiae, ut sub protectione tuae venerandae
potestatis secura quiet Deo deserviat. After which craving his favor in two
Ecclesiastical matters expressed in his Epistle; he concludes it thus; Tu
prosperitas regni, tu salus populi; Tu Decus Ecclesiae, tu omnium protectio
fidelium Christi. Nobis igitur sub umbrae potentiae, and sub tegmine pietatis
tua divina concessit gratia religiosam ducere vitam; atque secura quiet Deo
Christo deservire. Ideo sollicita mente, and pia intention, pro tua
prosperitate and salute curam habere, and intercedere justum and necessarium
habemus Domine desiderantissime, atque omni honor dignissime David Rex. In his
Col. 1649
Epist. 106. ad Karolum Imperatorem, he has this passage; Unde patenter
cognosci poterit, non tantum Imperatoriae vestrae prudentiae potestatem a Deo
ad solum mundi Regimen, SED MAXIM AD ECCLESIAE PRAESIDIUM et sapientiae
decorem collatum. Siquidem praeter Imperiales et publicas curas, evangelicas
quaestiones Academicis vestris a nobis enucleandas inquiritis, etc. Epistola 83
and 84. contain an Admonition of this Charles to Pope Leo, where he styles
himself Karolus Dei gratia Rex, and Defensor Sanctae Ecclesiae. Wherein among
other things he admonishes this Pope (who promised to do him Fealty upon the
certificate of the Charter of his Election sent to him) De Simoniaca
subvertenda haeresi, quae sanctae Ecclesiae corpus multis male maculat in
locis. Then informs the Pope, Nostrum est secundum aurilium divinae pietatis,
sanctam ubique Christi Ecclesiam ab incursu Paganorum, et ab infidelium
devastatione, armis defendere foris, et intus Catholicae fidei agnitione
munire. Vestram est sanctissime Pater elevatis ad Deum cum Moysi manibus
nostram adjuvare militiam, quatenus vobis intercedentibus Deo ductore et
datore, Col. 1730, 1748.
populus Christianus super inimicos sui sancti nominis ubique semper habeat
victoriam, etc. In his Poemata, Section 221. he writes thus to him. Tu decus
Eccleclesiae, Rector, defensor, amator. And elsewhere. Rex Carolus, Caput
orbis; Europae venerandus apex: altaque disponens venturae moenia Romae.
P^urima nempe tibi sunt emendanda per orbem. O Col, 1744.
Rex, O Rector, O Decus Ecclesiae: Grex est quippe tuus populus; tu pastor
ovilis. Ipsa caput mundi spectat te Roma Patronum; Rector et Ecclesiae, per te
rex rite regatur, etc. O pater, O Pastor, Rector, spes alma tuorum; Sit tibi
vita, salus, sit sine fine, Vale. Most of his Writings, Poems, Epistles are
full of the like expressions. In few words he writes of him, Epist: 105. Col.

Charles the Great, whiles King of France, (the greatest Protector of the Pope,
and See of Rome) by his Sovereign Ecclesiastical Authority, Anno 800
out of sacred Councils and Synods, collected a Book of Ecclesiastical Laws
and Constitutions, for the preservation and propagation of the Orthodox Faith,
the peace, good government, and discipline of the Church; the discharge of his
regal trust, duty, and salvation of his peoples souls which he enjoined all
Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priests, Monks Clergymen, and other his Subjects
to observe, thus prefaced by himself: Fredericus Lindebrogus, Codex Legum
Antiquarum, p. 829. 830. Cent: Magd: 8. cap. 7 col. 517, 518, 519.
Regnante Domino nostro Jesu Christo in perpetuum, Ego Karolus gratia Dei,
ejusque misericordia donan^e Rex et Rector regni Francorum, et devotus Sanctae
Dei Ecclesiae defensor, humilisque ad, utor, omnibus Ecclesiasticae pietutis
ordinibus seu seculari potentiae dignitatibus, in Christo Deo aeterno perpetuae
pacis et beatitudinis, salutem. Considerans pacifico piae mentis intuitu, una
cum Sacerdotibus, and consiliariis nostris, abundantem in nos nostrumque
populum Christi Regis ^clementiam, et quam necessarium est, non solum toto
cord and ore ejus pietati ag^regratias incessanter, sed etiam continuo bonorum
operum exercitatione ejus insistere laudibus, quatenus, qui nostro regno tantos
contulit honores, sua protectione nos, nostrumque regnum, in aeternum
conservare dignetur. Quapropter placuit nobis vestram rogare solertiam, O
Pastores Ecclesiarum Christi, and Ductores Gregis ejus, and clarissima mundi
luminaria, ut vigili cura, et sedula admonitione populum Dei per pascua vitae
aeternae ducere studeatis, et errantes oves bonorum exemplo operum seu
adhortatione, humeris intra Ecclesiasticae firmitatis muros reportare
satagatis: ne lupus insidians aliquem canonicas sanctiones transgredientem, vel
paternas traditiones Vniversalium Conciliorum excedentem, quod absit, inveniens
devoret. Ideo magnae devotionis studio admonendi and adhortandi sunt, imo
compellendi, ut firma fide et infatigabili perseverantia, intra paternas
sanctiones se contineant. In quo operis studio, sciat certissime sanctitas
vestra nostram vobis cooperari diligentiam. Quapropter et nostros ad vos
direximus missas, qui ex nostri nominis authoritate, una vobiscum corrigerent
quae corrigenda essent. Sed et aliqua Capitula ex Canonicis institutionibus,
quae magis vobis necessaria videbantur, subjunximus. Ne aliquis quaeso hujus
pietatis admonitionem esse praesumptuosam putet vel judicet, qua nos errata
corrigere, superflua abscindere, recta coarctare studeamus, sed magis benevolo
charitatis animo suscipiat. Nam legimus in Regnorum libris, quomodo sanctus
Josias Regnum sibi, a Deo datum circumeundo, corrigendo and admonendo cultum
very Dei studuit revocare. Non ut me ejus sanctitati aquiparabilem faciam, sed
quod nobis sint ubique Sanctorum semper exempla exsequenda, et quoscunque
poterimus ad studium bonae vitae in laudem et in gloriam Domini nostri Jesus
Christi congregare necesse est. Quapropter ut praedirimus, aliqua Capitula
notare jussimus, ut simul nec eadem vos admonere studeatis, et quaecunque vobis
alia necessaria esse scitis, ut et ista et illa aequali intention praedicetis:
Nec aliquid quod vestrae sanctitati populoque Dei utile videatur omittatis, sed
pio studio admoneatis, quatenus et vestra solertia, subjectorum obedientia
aeterna faelicitate ab omnipotenti Deo remuneretur.

pete^s, ut Romanum populum Papae Sacramento fidei data sub^iceret, against
their wills; upon this occasion, Anno 799. there was a great sedition raised at
Rome against this Pope, whose Opposites as he was riding in procession from his
Palace of Lateran to St. Laurence Church, threw him from his horse, put out his
eyes, and cut off his tongue as they imagined, leaving him naked and half dead
in the Streets, and afterward thrust him into the Monastery of St. Erasmus as
a prisoner; whence he escaping went into France, complained of this injury to
Charles the Great, who Anno 800. marched to Rome accompanied with this Pope;
where after 7. days stay calling an Assembly of the Bishops, Abbots, et omnem
Nobilitatem Francorum et Romanorum, He acquainted them, that the principal
cause of his coming to Rome, and convening them now, was; De discutiendis quae
objecta sunt Pontifici criminibus: ejus calumniatores mortiferum ei crimen
imposuerunt. Rege autem hoc inquirente, cum nullus esset criminis probator,
Pontifer assumpto Evangelii textu coram Rege et omni populo ambonem conscendit,
astantibusque accusatoribus invocato sanctae Trinitatis nomine, jure jurando ab
objectis se expurgavit, etc. Lo here King Charles before he was crowned Emperor
sat as Supreme Judge in Rome it self, examining the Crimes objected against the
Pope, who when witnesses failed, purged himself before him and all the people
by his Oath, and was thereupon acquitted. Immediately after, (by way of
gratitude for his restitution to the Papacy, and absolution from his objected
crimes) King Charles coming on Christmas day to divine Service, this Pope Leo
on a sudden rising from prayers, Carolo, nihil minus speranti (as Abbas
Uspergensis relates, though others conceive it was by his own appointment) Papa
coronam imposuit, et Imperatorem Romanum pronunciavit, et a cuncto Romano
populo acclamatum est, Carolo Augusto a Deo (not Papa) coronato, Magno et
Pacifico, Imperatori Romanorum, vita et victoria. Post quas lauds, unctus ab
Apostolico, et antiquorum more Principum, ab eo adoratur, ablato Patricii
nomine, Imperator et Augustus appellatus est: Which Fastorum, l, 4.

Balaeus and others. But whosoever shall impartially consider these ensuing
particulars, will at first discover the falsity and absurdity of these
Conclusions: 1. The several Letters, supplications, addresses of Pope Hadrian,
Stephen, Leo, and others, to Pipin, Carolomannus, and this King Charles, to
protect and desend them against Aistulphus, Desiderius, the Lombards, Romans,
Exarchs, and other their opposites, who deposed, expelled, and seized upon
their persons, possessions from time to time; who thereupon restored these
Popes to, yea confirmed them in their Papacy by their swords, and new Charters
of Donations. 2ly. That they submitted themselves to them as their Lords,
Patrons, Protectors, surrendered up St. Peter's Keys, and the Roman Ensigns to
them. 3ly. That the Pope, Council, Nobles and people of Rome, granted the power
of electing, confirming the Pope, and the Government of the Sea and City of
Rome to this Charles and his successors. 4ly. That before he was crowned
Emperor he sat as Judge of this Popes crimes, when others refused out of fear
to Judge him; that after his purgation he absolved and pronounced him innocent,
then gave judgment of death, banishment against his false accusers and
persecutors, beheading no less then 300 of them, as some record. 5ly. That
Charles by way of conquest got actual possession of Rome and Italy; made
himself Emperor thereof, his son Pipin King of Italy, and this Leo actual Pope,
by his own sword alone, not by this Popes antecedent gift or donation, who
never had any precedent right in, or possession of them. Hence Chron^con. Lib.

sundry others truly observe, Qualiter Carolus, assumpto Pontifice totoque
populo, Augustus vocatus, Imperium a Gracis ad Francos transtulit; Hujus
virtute Regnum Francorum plurimum augmentatum est, omniumque Regnorum Maximum,
Romanum scilicet, ab Orient ad Occidentem translatum, Not by the Popes or St.
Peter's authority, as Pontificians fancre. 6ly. See Ma^silius, Patavinus,
Defensoris Pacis, pars. 2. c. 17. 24, 25.
That all this Popes Predecessors were subject to the Emperors, their elections
approved, yea their persons judged, deposed by them from time to time, as the
premises evidence. 7ly. That the people of Sigonius de Regno Ital. l. 4
Anastatius in Leone 3. Dr. (...) Defense of C^^stantine, c. 14. p. 327, 328,
333. to 340.
Rome by their unanimous acclamations and assents, rather elected and made
Charles their Emperor, then the Pope, (who only declared, anointed, crowned him
Emperor, ministerially, as other Archbishops and Bishops crown their Kings, as
Cardinals, Bishops crown Popes themselves) not authoritatively, as disposers of
their Crowns, Empires, Kingdoms, as Supreme Lords thereof. 8ly. That this Pope,
together with the people of Rome, and all present at Charles his Coronation
cried out, That God had made and crowned him Emperor (by his providence and
his own victorious successes) not the Pope, or Romans, as Carolo Augusto A DEO
CORONATO, etc. resolves. 9ly. That as the Sea here, p 22. 23.
High Priests and Priests anointing and crowning of David, Solomon, and other
Kings of Judah and Jerusalem by Gods appointment under the Law, gave them no
Jurisdiction or superiority over their persons or Kingdoms: So the Popes and
Bishops anointing, crowning of Emperors, Kings under the Gospel, (warranted by
no Gospel precept or president of Christ, Peter, or any other Apostle, Bishop,
Priest) can much less do it. Hence (...)
Thomas Waldensis (though a great Champion for the Popes and Bishops
Jurisdiction and Supremacy) dogmatically resolves: 1. Regia potestas prima sui
origin a Deo est, non a Sacerdo^e. 2. Quanquam ministerio Episcoporum Regibus
imponatur Unctio et Coronatio nihil praestant Imperiali potestati, sed sunt
tantummodo solennitas and siunt honoris and officii causa, non necessitatis;
nec quicquam hac action Caesaribus accedat: as Jacobus Almain, De Potestat.
Eccles. and Laic, qu. 2. c. 10. Cusa^us l. 3. c. 4. Hieronimus Balbus de
Corona, p. 68. Lupoldus de J^re Reg. and Imperat. cap. 4 and 11. Dr.
C^akenthorps defense of Constantine, c. 14. p. 341, 34^. resolve.
Corona, et insignia conferantur, non est propterea dicendum, Regiam illam
dignitatem ortum habere a sacerdote. Quanquam ministerio Episcoporum
solemnitates adhibentur Regibus unctionis, jusjurandi, fidei et coronae; non
tamen habet regia illa dignitas ortum a Sacerdotio, quanquam per ministerium
Sacerdotis hoc habet a Deo; sicut nec ordinatus quisquam habet ordinationis
ortum a Praesule, aut Sacramentum Eucharistiae a Sacerdote quolibet celebrante;
ab homine enim est solennitatis ministerium: Deus vero solus largitur officium.
Which he proves by St. Chrysostom, Tom: 1. Hom. 1. De Unctione Samuelis in
David Regem: On whose words he observes: Palam dicit, Deum coronasse Regem quem
homo despexit, et ungitur quidem Ministerio hominis, sed Dei nutu. Ita quidem
est et per hoc evidens, quod a Sacerdote non habet Rex originem. Vel iterato
concludimus, quod Sacerdotium initium habet a Duce, quia Moses unxit Aaron,
Levit. 8. Nec tamen hoc verum est, nec quod autumat Doctor Adam, ideo regnum
Cain defecisse, quia sine Sacerdote regnavit. Thus he most solidly and
unanswerably determines: which quite subverts the Popes Supremacy over the
Emperor from his bare designation, unction, coronation of him. 10ly. That all
See Dr. Crakenthorps Defense of Constantine, p. 323, to 341. where it is
largely evidenced.
the People of Rome and other Prelates present at this Coronation had a hand,
voice in this designation and coronation of Charles to be Emperor, and in
translating the Empire to him from the Germans, as much as this Pope: Will it
therefore follow, that all and every of them there present paramount the
Emperor, or Kings, and might dispose of the Emperor, Empire and Italy at their
pleasure? If yea: then each of them was as great and omnipotent as this Pope.
If not, then the inference is most absurd. 11ly. Defensori^. Pacis, pars 2. c.

Marsilius Patavinus long since thus discovers and refutes this inserence of
the Pope and his Parasites. Quae autem finaliter addebatur deductio, quoniam
secundum Jurisdictionem ille superior est ad Romanum Imperatorem, ipsumque de
jure instituere atque deponere potest, qui transtulit Imperium a Graecis in
Germanos in persona Magni Caroli. Hic autem est Papa Romanus. Ergo Imperatoris
superior, ipsumque instituere atque deponere potest. Dicendum, quod si major
indefinite sumatur, ex ipsa cum minore nihil infertur, propter non fieri
syllogismum ex indefinita cum particulari. Si vero signatur universaliter, ut
dicatur; Omnis translater imperii Romani a Graecis i^ Romanos, superior est,
etc. nisi determinetur subjectum, quam plures haberet haec propositio veras
instantias. Si enim quis de facto and non de jure transtulisset imperium; aut
si aliena, ceu sibi ab altero tunc data potestate ad hoc, tanquam procuratori,
vel quasi; qui sic inquam transtulisset (as this Pope did to Charles) non
propter hoc solus superiorem Jurisdictionem haberet, nec potestatem justam
Romanum Principem instituendi aut deponendi. Si vero determinata jam dicta
priori propositione, ut omnis mortalis qui transtulit, aut transfer potest
Romanum Imperium a Graecis in Germanos just, autoritate propria, non sibi
concessa per alterum, superior est secundum coactivam jurisdictionem ad Romanum
Principem, ipsumque just instituere atque deponere potest; Quae huic
annectitur secunda, videlicet, Romanus Episcopus, sive Papa est, qui transtulit
Imperium, ut dictum est; neganda est tanquam omnino falsa; Nam eius opposita
demonstrata est, l. 1. c. 15. etc. per Scripturam, and dicta Sanctorum atque
catholicorum Doctorum, Lib. 2. c. 4, 5. sicque observatum de facto sine
reclamatione fuisse per antiquos patres et pastores Romanos Episcopos,
persuasimus (21. hujus) ex approbatis historiis, Esto igitur Imperii
translationem a Graecis in Germanos just factam, etc. Dico tamen, quod non
authoritate Romanae Papae solius, aut cum suo solo collegio Clericorum, ut
pridem diximus. Et propterea oportet attendere (secundum demonstrationes
inductas, c. 12. 13, and 15. lib. 1.) quod ejusdem est autoritas prima secundum
rationem rectam intendentibus, leges humanas statuendi, principatum
instituendi, Principem assumendi, authoritatem illi concedendi, and haec omnia
mutandi, destruendi, augendi ve^ minuendi, suspendendi, corrigendi, deponendi,
transferendi, recreandi, and reliqua faciendi circa ea quae jam dictam aut
horitatem habenti principaliter, non ab altero expedire videntur, and per suam
expresserit voluntatem: Cujus autem sit auctoritas supradicta, determinatum
est, c. 12, 13. l. 1. (viz.) Legislator vel causa legis effectiva prima ac
propria, esse populus, seu Civium Vniversitas, aut ejus valentior pars
(quantitate) per suam electionem, vel per voluntatem in generali civium
congregatione per sermonem expressam, praecipientem vel determinantem aliquid
fieri vel remitti, circa civiles actus humanos, sub poena vel supplicio
temporali) Propter quod ubicunque legatur, and a quocunque dicatur translatum
fuisse Imperium, aut alter quicunque Principatus, aut Princeps aliquis qui per
electionem assumitur, institutus per Papam, vel aliam personam singularem, aut
per Collegium singular aliquod provinciae sive regni: si vera debeat esse
Scriptura vel sermo, et valida seu justa institutio, sive translatio talis,
oportet fieri, aut factam esse autoritate Legislatoris primi in provincia vel
provinciis, super quas, a quibus, et ad quas debet institutio aut translatio
fieri, aut facta fore. Ideoque translatio Imperii Romani, vel Imperatoris
alicujus institutio, dicatur aut scribatur rite facta fuisse per Papam Romanum
solum, aut per ipsum cum suo solo collegio Clericorum, and verum sit hujusmodi
dictum aut scriptum, oportet translationem aut institutionem jam dictam per
ipsos intelligere factam, per autoritatem illis concessam adhoc a Romani
Imperii Legislatore humano supremo, per medium, aut sine medio, vel ab eis
quidem non factam simpliciter, sed modo quodam, ut publicatam vel pronunciatam,
autoritate tamen praedicta. But neither this Pope nor his successors had any
such authority, either from the rightful Roman Emperor Leo, then residing at
Constantinople, nor from the Universality or majority of the Nobles, Princes,
Bishops, Clergy, People of the then Roman Empire, thus suddenly at Rome to
translate the Empire from the Grecians to the French, and to intail it upon
them; nor yet from God himself, or St. Peter, as I have proved at large in the
precedent Chapters; and Marsilius Patavinus in his two whole Books entitled
Defensor Pacis: Therefore it must needs be altogether illegal, invalid,
injurious, yea an Antichristian Usurpation, as the forecited, together with Dr.
Barnes, Balaeus, the Century Writers, Morney, Jewel, with Dr. Crakenthorp his
Defense of Constantine, cap. 14.
other Protestant Writers censure it; and the ill effects thereof, in sowing
the seeds of perpetual enmity, desolation, schisms, wars between the Emperors,
Churches, Bishops of the East and West, and since that between the Popes and
German Emperors, unde tot strages, tot incendia, tot regnorum vastationes,
schismata and bella plusquam civilia subsecutae sunt, as Heronimus Marius, Acta
Pontif. Romanorum in Leone 3.
Balaeus, and others observe. All which considered, the Pontificians grand
Argument of the Popes Supremacy over all Kings, kingdoms, the Roman and Grecian
Emperors and Empires, to remove and translate them at their Papal arbitrary
pleasures, must fall quite to ground.

a Bishop, being violently and in a strange manner murdered in Gascoigne;
thereupon 32 Archbishops and Bishops assembled in a Synod apud Theodoms villam
in the County of Lutzenberg, and having drawn up a Writing, inflicting
Ecclesiastical and pecuniary punishments on those who should assault or murder
any Bishop, Priest, or Clergy man, tendered them to the Emperor Charles the
Great, his Princes and peoples consideration and approbation; Si Principibus
placuerit, aliisque fidelibus suis, rogamus, ut conlaudetur et subscribatur.
After perusal of them. Et conlaudatum et subscriptum est tam a Principe, quam a
caeteris omnibus. With this addition. Si quis per industrian Episcopum
occiderit, juxta id quod apud Triburiae a 24 Episcopis decretum est, et quod
ibi a nobis (Carolo magno and Ludovico) et a principibus totius Germaniae
benign collaudatione conlaudatum est, et subscriptum est. Et hoc de nostro
adjecimus: ut si quis in his supradictis sanctorum Canonum nostrique Decreti
santionibus, Episcopis inobediens and contumax extiterit, primum cancnica
sententia feriatur. Deinde in nostro regno beneficium non habeat, and
alodiscius in annum mittatur. Et si annum and diem in banno permanserit, ad

hymnum, Te Deum laudamus, decantaverunt. Et sic soluta est Synodus. Their
Canons being all first approved and subscribed by the Emperors and their
Nobles, with some Additions, to make them valid.

which, compiling 51. Canons (whereof the first is for the inviolable
observation of their faith and allegiance to, and constant praying for the
Emperor and his sons) they thus submit them wholly to his judgment to confirm
or disallow. Haec nos in Conventu nostro ita ventilavimus; sed quomodo deinceps

temperantiae praecepit, scholas constituant, in quibus and literaria solertia
disciplinae, and sacrae scripturae documenta discantur, and tales ibi

Canons being drawn up as the Emperor prescribed: In the Cloze they thus
submitted them to him: Haec itaque pauca de pluribus quae necessaria
perspeximus, cum magna brevitate Domini Imperatoris prudenti judicio
praesentanda adnotavimus; To confirm, alter, enlarge, or reject, as he thought
fit in his Royal Judgment.

The famous Surius Council. Tom. 3. p. 285. Centur. Mag. 9. c. 9. de Synod.
Council of Mentz under Charles the Great who summoned it, Anno 813.
consisted of 3. several Companies, sitting distinct one from another, The 1.
of Bishops and other Clergymen; The 2. of Abbots and religious persons; In
tertia denique turma sederunt Comites and Judices, in mundanis legibus
decertantes, etc. All which concurred in the 56. Constitutions there made, as,
In his itaque omnibus omnes decrevimus, etc. with the Acts of this Council
attest. The Preface of the Bishops and Clergy to this Council, begins thus.
Gloriosissimo and Christianissimo Imperatori Carolo Augusto, verae religionis
Rectori, ac defensori Sauctae Dei Ecclesiae; una cum prole sua ejusque
fidelibus, vita and salus, honor and benedictio, cum victoria sine fine
mansura. Then relating their proceedings so soon as they assembled in this
Council; they add: Consona voce gratias agimus Deo patri Omnipotenti, quia
sanctae Ecclesiae suae tam pium et devotum in servitio Dei concessit habere
Rectorem, qui suis temporibus sacrae sapientiae fontem aperiens, oves Christi
indesinenter sanctis reficit alimentis, ac divinis instruit disciplinis;
Christianumque populum indefesso labor amplificare conatur, hilariterque
Christi honorat Ecclesias, ac de fauce diri draconis multorum animas studet
eripere, et ad sinum sanctae matris Ecclesiae revocare, atque ad gaudia
paradisi, atque ad regna coelestia omnes communiter invitare, sanctaque
sapientia sua devotissimo studio caeteros Reges terrae transcendens. If this
were not the principal part of his Imperial, Regal office, care, trust, duty,
these Bishops, Clergymen, and this whole Council, would never have thus blessed
God, nor applauded the Emperor, nor left this testimony of his transcendent
piety, care of the salvation of all his Subjects and peoples souls to
posterity: In this Council they compiled 56. Canons and Constitutions; which
they thus most humbly tendered and submitted wholly to the Emperors royal wisdom
or pleasure. Surius. Ibidem p. 286.
De his tamen omnibus valde indigemns vestro adjutorio, atque sana doctrina,
quae et nos jugiter admoneat, atque clementer erudiat, quatenus ea quae paucis
subter perstrinximus capitulis, a vestra authoritate firmentur: si tamen vestra
pietas ita dignum esse judicaverit, et quicquid in eis emendatione dignum
reperitur, vestra magnifica imperialis dignitas jubeat emendare: ut ita
emendata, nobis omnibus et cunctae Christianae plebi, ac posteris nostris
proficiant ad vitam, et salutem, et ad Gloriam sempiternam, vobisque inde
merces, honor, et laus, et benedictio ac beatitudo permaneat in omnes
aeternitates seculi, Amen.

Emperor to ratify: witness the 33, 41, 42, 43, 44. Canons, wherein we have
these passages. Domini Imperatoris misericordia imploranda, ut victum and
necessaria a sibi Praelatis consequi possunt sanctimoniales, and vita illarum
and castitas secundum fragilitatem sexus diligenter provisa tueatur. Vt Dominus
Imperator, secundum statutum bonae memoriae Domini Pipini, misericordiam
faciat, ne solidi qui in lege habentur, per Quadraginta denarios discurrant, ut
in sua eleemosyna firmiter statuat, ne quilibet in suum pergentibus servitium,
ullatenus prohibere audeat mansionem, neque aliis quibus necessitas incumbit:
Vt ejus magnificum, et cuncto Imperio ejus, suis et futuris temporibus firmetur
Capitulum, sive ab anno 30, a quo adhuc testes haberi possunt, seu etiam ab
illo, a quo felicissimum ejus sumpsit exordium, qualiter omnes lites and jurgia
in sua misericordia terminum habere potuissent. Ut de falsis testibus ejus
simili modo piissimum firmetur capitulum, qualiter and hoc, quod ille Bononiae
statuit, firmissimum habeatur, and adhuc quaermur, quatenus in sua piissima
misericordia, si qua necessaria sunt augeantur, etc. All these Canons standing
at the Emperors courtesy to ratify, proves undeniably, that without his
approbation and confirmation, they were mere nullities. Wherefore Aistulphus
Archbishop of Mentz, (as Eccles. Gallicanae decretorum Additamenta ad tit. 20.
l. 51. p. 1371.
Bochellus informs us) spoke thus in that Synod; Si Principi placuerit aliisque
fidelibus suis, rogamus, ut conlaudetur, et subscribatur. Et conlaudatum est,
et subscriptum est, tam a Principe quam a caeteris omnibus.

Otto Frisingensis Chron. l. 5. c. 33. Abbas Uspergensis Chron. p. 180, 181.
Ludovicus Pius his son succeding this Emperor Charles, Anno. 815.
in the 1. year of his reign, (before he was crowned Emperor) was informed,
that Pope Leo had commanded some Chief men in Rome to be slain, for conspiring
against him. Ad quod perscrutandum, vocatum ad se nepotem suum Bernardum,
Italiae Regem, Romam misit: qui in urbe informatus, rei eventum per Heroldum
Comitem Augusto mandavit: Leo quoque missis ad Imperatorem nunciis, de his quae
sibi imposita erant, se expurgavit. Legati de his quae Domino suo
objiciebantur, regi Ludovico per omnia satisfecerunt. Lo here the Emperor in
Rome it self, inquired by his Delegates of the Popes crimes for which he was
accused, who by his special Legates purged himself from them before the King,
and gave him full satisfaction therein.

This Pope Leo confirmed the forecited Decree of Pope Hadrian his Predecessor,
Jus eligendi Romanum Pontificem, ordinan^^ Romanam sedem, and consedendi
investituras Episcopis, etc. ratum habens; as Pontificum Romanorum vitae, p.
91, 92.
Dr. Barnes and others record: Neither was this a Novelty in that age, since
Pope Leo the 1. (as Distinctio 63 cap. Vota.
Gratian resolves us) by this his Papal Decree, declared it near 270. years
before. Vota Civium, testimonia populorum, honoratorum arbitrium, and electio
Clericorum in ordinationibus Sacerdotum constituantur. Princibus vero atque
Imperatoribus electiones Romanorum Pontificum atque aliorum Episcoporum
referendas, USUS ET CONSTITUTIO TRADIDIT, pro schismaticorum atque haereticorum
dissentionibus, quibus nonnunquam Ecclesia Dei concussa, periclitabatur: contra
quos legibus fidelissimorum Imperatorum frequenter Ecclesia munita legitur.
Representabatur ergo electio Cleri coram Principibus, ut eorum authoritate
roborata, nullus haereticorum vel schismaticorum auderet contraire; et ut ipsi
Principes tanquam devotissimi filii in eum consentient, quem sibi in Patrem
eligi viderentur, ut in omnibus suffragatores existerent; sicut Valentinianus
beato Ambrosio legitur dirisse, Noli timere, quia Deus qui te elegit, semper te
adjuvabit, et ego adjutor et defensor tuus ut meum ordinem decet, semper
eristam. On which Bartholomeus Buxiensis, and Dr. Thierry in their Glosses,
observe. Hic duplex ratio redditur quare quondam Regibus et Imperatoribus
electiones representabantu: scilicet, ut nullus haereticorum et schismaticorum
electionem contraveniret, pro quibus saepe Ecclesia periclitabatur, et ut ipsi
Principes tanquam filii devotissimi, consentirent in electum, quem sibi
viderint in patrem eligi etc.

Pope Leo the 3. deceasing Anno 816. Stephen the 4th. Anno 816
without the Emperor Ludovicus his privity or license, was elected and
consecrated Pope in his place, contrary to Law; and the Decrees of Pope Adrian,
Leo, and this ancient usage: who post completam solenniter consecrationem suam,
quam maximis potuit itineribus ad Imperatorem venire contendit, Legatis cum
excusationibus de sui consecratione praemissis; qui ejus animum lenirent.
Meeting Ludovicus at Rhemes, and giving him an account of his coming to him,
to exp^ate his offense, eum impositione diadematis coronavit, Romanorumque
Imperatorem procla navit, eique omnem populum Romanum sid litatem cum juramento
promittere procuravit. Moreover he published this decree in confirmation of the
Emperors right in electing Popes, though with some allay, thus recorded by
Distinctio 63 cap. Quia.
Gratian, Stephanus Papastatuit, dicens, Quia sancta Romana Ecclesia (cui Deo
authore praesidemus) a pluribus patitur violentias Pontifice obeunte, quae ob
hoc inferuntur, quia absque Imperiali notitia Pontificis fit electio et
consecratio, nec canonico ritu et consuetudine, ab Imperatore directi sunt
Nuncii; qui vetent scandala fieri; Volumus, ut cum instituendus est Pontife^,
convenientibus Episcopis et universo Clero, eligant praesente Senatu et populo
qui ordinandus est, et sic ab omnibus electus praesentibus Legatis Imperialibus
consecretur, nullusque sine periculo sui juramenta vel promissiones aliquas
nova adinventione audeat extorquere, nisi quae antiqua erigit consuetudo, ne
vel Ecclesia scandalizetur, et Imperialis magnificentia minuatur. On which
Papal Decree, Dr. Thierry, Bartholomeus Buxiensis, and the ordinary Gloss thus
descant and paraphrase, Quia, Casus, Romana Ecclesia saepe patiebatur molestiam
in obitu Papae in electione successoris quia Nuncii Imperatoris defuerant: ideo
statuit Stephanus, quod electio Papae non fieret, nisi praesente populo, et
Senatu, et Imperatore, vel ejus Legatis, ut scandala removeantur, et eis
praesentibus consecretur, et nullus audeat extorquere juramenta vel
promissiones nisi quae fuerint de antiqua consuetudine.

This Pope Stephanus the 4. durst not presume to consecrate the Bishop of
Reatine when elected by the Clergy and people, Anno 817
till his election was first approved and ratified by the Emperor Ludovicus his
special Patent, according to ancient custom, as appears by his Letter to Earl
Guide, registered by Distinctio 63. c. L^ctis, Platina, Stella. (...) Stephano 4.

dolentes, nunc ipsum ^l^ctum unanimitate and Canonica ipsius Ecclesiae

nobis (ut mos est) absolutionis minime detulerit Epistolam: pro qua scilicet re
ambiguum est nobis; ideo voluntati vestrae in hoc parere distulimus, ne
Augustalis animus durissime hoc quocunque modo perciperet. Sed scientes
Ecclesiam Dei sine proprio diu pastore non debere consistere, gloriae vestrae

fingens jus Carolo and Successoribus ejus, a Pontifice Hadriano 1. and Leone 3.

investituras Episcopis, etc.) plurimum mali secum trahere, jus illud abrogabat,
pronunciatque, jus eligendi Pontificis, debere esse penes Clerum, Senatum,
populumque Romanum. Ne vero Imperator suum jus asseret vi, addidit Decreto
Hadriani 1. and Leonis 3. interpretationem: Pontificem Romanum eligere licere
^ine Imperatoris auctoritate; sed non licere consecrare, sine praesentia
Casaris, vel Caesariorum Legatorum. Post haec tempora Imperatoribus invitis
electionem Pontificis and investituram Episcoporum, Romana se es (paulatim)
sibi usurpavit. After which this Emperor by his persuasions released his right
and Prerogative in electing and confirming the Pope, formerly granted by Pope
Adrian, and Leo, illam tantum praerogativam Imperatoribus servans, ut electus
and consecratus Pontifex ad stabiliendam amicitiam Legationem mittat Regibus

This Pope Stephen dying within 3. months after his return to Rome, Anno 817
Paschalis the 1. was elected by all the Priests, Abbas V^pe^gensis Chron: An.

Clergy, as also by the Nobles, and all the People of Rome, and consecrated
contrary to the forementioned Decrees of his predecessors, without the Emperors
license first obtained, or his Ambassadors assent to, or presence thereat.
Whereupon post completam solenniter ordinationem suam, to excuse this his
innovation, presumption and contempt against the Emperors Prerogative Royal,
munera and excusatoriam Epistolam misit, sibi non solum nolenti, sed etiam
plurimum poenitenti Pontificatus honorem impactum asseverans. Missaratum, alia
legatione pactum quod cum praedecessoribus suis factum fuerat, and secum fieri
and firmari rogavit (to wit, concerning the election of Popes by the Emperors
license, and in the presence of him, or his Ambassadors, not otherwise, for the
transgression whereof, he humbly craved the Emperors pardon, upon his repentance
of, and enforcement thereunto against his will) and ea quae petierat, in
petravit. The Emperor Ludovicus accepting this his submission and excuse, monet
Clerum atque populum Romanum, ne in futurum Caesaream majestatem laedant, and
ut majorum statuta servent in creando Ponifice, wherein they had of late no
less then thrice transgressed. This Emperor soon after crowned Lotharius his
son King of Italy, and his companion in the Empire; who passing near Rome, Pope
Paschal invited him to the City, and receiving him there honorably on
Easter Day, apud sanctum Petrum, and regni coronam and Imp. Augusti nomen
accepit, from this Popes hands who consecrated him. After his return from Rome,
the Emperor was informed that Theodorus Pincernus, and Leo per seditionem
privantur oculis, and truncantur capite, quod fideliter juvarent parts
Lotharii, which sedition and murder in Rome was by common fame and just
suspicion, imputed to Pope Paschal, as the contriver or commander thereof, or
at least conniver^at it. Ludovicus thereupon, Legatos designat ad perscrutandam
facti veritatem, viz. Adalindum Abbatem, and Humfridum Co^^item Curiensem. Pope
Paschal being informed of the Emperors intention, sent two Delegats, the one a
Bishop, the other an Archdeacon to the Emperor, ad se purgandum ab infamia
excitatae seditionis and perpetratae caedis. Caesar autem (auditis etiam
Ponticis Legatis) being unsatisfied with their excuses, jubet suos Legatos
Romam proficisci, ut quid sit verum percunctentur. But the business being so
smothered at Rome, that they could not find out the truth upon examination;
thereupon this Pope, coa^^a Synodo (...) Episcoporum, Iurejurando se purgat,
and interfectores in ea seditione absolvens, cae os reos agit laesae
Majestatis, (as if they were Traitors to the Emperor) and so iure occisos esse
pronunciat. All clear evidences of the Emperors Supremacy over this Pope.

The ancient Right of Emperors and Kings to grant Licenses to elect Bishops
upon Petitions of the Clergy and People, to confirm them after they were chosen
Bishops, and install them in their Bishoprics, is most clearly evidenced by
Printed in Prede^icus Lindebrogus, Codex Legum Antiquarum, p. 1205, etc. 1213,
1214. and Bibliotheca Patrum, Coloniae Agrip. Tom 7. p. 564, 56^, 566.

Christian Kings Charters in that and former ages, for conferring of a
Bishopric, and consecrating a Bishop, when elected and approved by the King,
having some memorable expressions, evidencing the supreme care of the Church
and Peoples souls to belong to Kings, who are to provide able godly Bishops
under them, diligently to preach to the Peoples, as well as govern them, and to
pray for Kings prosperity. Ille Rex viro Apostolico illo Episcopo. Quamlibet
nos ad ministrandum guberrandumque rerum statum praecelsis occupationibus regis

Pastorali paululum oberrat plebs destituta praesidio, pro salute animarum
hujusmodi personis loci Celsioris Pontificalem prospiciat committere
dignitatem, in quibus maneat dupliciter sermo, ut populus Magistrum, actus
Christi imitetur Discipulus. Qui plebem non minus pietate, quam severitate
constringat qui sciat commissa sibi talenta assidua praedicatione sermonibus

recordationis Dominum ill. urbis ill. antistitem, evocatione divina ab hac luce
migrasse, de cujus successione sollicitudinem congruam una cum Pontificibus vel
Proceribus nostris before pertractantes, decrevimus illustri viro, aut

quem plerunque apud animos nostros and actio probata commendat, et nobilitatis

These forms extended as well to Popes and Patriarchs, as other Ordinary
Bishops, who were not anciently elected nor consecrated, but by Kings and
Emperors precedent Licenses, and special Charters or Letters of approbation,
according to these forms, as the premises evidence.

This Emperor in the year 819. (as Chronicon, p. 181. Surius Council. Tom: 3 p.

Aquisgrane: Anno 819
wherein, secundum ardentissimam erga divinum cultu^ sibi caelitus inspiratam
voluntatem, multa magna and necessaria de emendatione sanctae Dei Ecclesiae,
scienter and curiose pertractare caepit; admonishing, advising, yea assisting
this Council what to do, and how to proceed in the reformation of abuses in
sorts of Clergymen and religious Persons, whose respective offices, duties are
at large defined by this Council in 145 Chapters, which when they had finished,
hujus institutionis formam coram memorato glorioso Principe prolatam, the whole
Council approving and applauding it as useful for the Church, and containing
nothing in it, which any person well advised could dislike; the Emperor when he
had heard it read, approved it; and he with all there present cried out, Deo
gratias; Nec immerito; quippe qui and occulta sua dispensatione, and gratissima
inspiratione praefatum Principem, ut id fieri moneret, compulit, et ad effectum
produceretur, miserando adiuvet. Proinde omnium sententia statutum est, ab

Additional Laws are reduced into 4. Books consisting of 306. Chapters,
concerning Abbots, Abbesses, Monks, Nuns, Metropolitans, Bishops, Priests, all
sorts of Ecclesiastical persons, affairs, duties, vices, crimes, and their
respective punishments: to which he prefixed this Preface; Quia Scriptura
testatur, Quodcunque possumus, instanter operari debemus quia nulli ad been
operandum crastinus dies permittitur: Omnesque, secundum Apostolum, ante
Tribunal Christi stabimus, ut unusquisque rationem pro his, quae gessit,
reddat; Nobis praecipue, (qui caeteris mortalibus condition aequales
existimus, and dignitate tantum superiores sumus, secundum Scripturam sacram,
quae dicit; Quoniam interrogab^t opera nostra et cogitationes scrutabitur,
rations reddituri sumus) sollicita circumspectione, totaque mentis intention
satagendum est, ut bonis operibus jugiter insistendo, his quibus praeesse
videmur, modis omnibus, quantum nobis divina suffragante misericordia facultas
adtributa fuerit, prodesse curemus. Sed quia omne datum optimum, et omne donum
perfectum desursum est, debemus continuis Precibus dominum humiliter exorare,
faciemque illius humili confessione et congrua, prout ipse posse dederit,
emendatione praevenire: ut sicut ejus est muneris quod regnamus, ejus sit
pietatis quod foeliciter regnamus. Quatenus eo miserante, and regni gubernacula
aequissimo libramine tenere, and ad eum qui Rex Regum est, et Dominus
Dominantium, cum multiplici fructu administrationis nostrae, justitiae
scilicet, and pietate atque humilitate, sine fine cum eo regnaturi mereamur
pervenire. Et quoniam per Apostolum suum nos adjutores suos appellare dignatus
est: et Sancta Ecclesia, ejus videlicet sponsa, in Scripturis sacris hortus est
appellata, quotidianis exercitiis adhibito sarculo bonae operationis est
excolenda. Ut sicut semper nociva in ea velut in bono agro emergunt: ita semper
laboris boni studio eradicentur noxia, plantentur utilia. Oportet et Nos
cunctis ejus necessitatibus nisibus quibus possumus devote consulere: quatenus
in ejus emendatione, quantum Dominus posse dederit, tota cum mentis devotione
elaborantes, in aliqua part aedificiorum illius, a fabricatore ejus, Domino
scilicet Jesus Christo, aptari mereamur. Proinde notum sit omnibus fidelibus
Sanctae Dei Ecclesiae nostrisque Domino dispensante successoribus, quia cum nos
nullis existentibus meritis, divina pietas genitore nostro a rebus humanis
exempto, ad ejus Imperii culmen provexisset, quomodo aut qualiter desiderium
divini cultus, quod ab ineunte aetate Christo inspirante, mente conceperam, ad
effectum Domino suffragante perduceremus, et quid studii, quidve laboris
progenitores nostri, praecipue tamen piae recordationis genitor, in
utilitatibus sanctae Dei Ecclesiae exhibuerit adverteremus, et pia illorum
facta non solum inviolata conservare, sed etiam imitari, pro viribus nobis a
Domino concessis optaremus. Scilicet, ut sive in Ecclesiasticis negotiis, sive
in statu Reipublicae emendatione dignum prospexissemus, quantum Dominus posse
dabat, nostro studio emendaretur. Et hactenus hinc inde mundanorum turbinum
procellis emergentibus, diversissimisque occupationibus ingruentibus
praepediti, ut optaveramus efficere nequivissemus, ejus rei gratia 4. Anno
Imperii nostri accersitis nonnullis Episcopis, Abbatibus, Canonicis, and
Monachis, and fidelibus obtutibus nostris studuimus eorum consulta sagacissima
investigare inquisitione, qualiter unicuique ordini, Canonicorum videlicet and
Monachorum, and Laicorum, juxta quod ratio dictabat, and facultas suppetebat,
Deo opem ferente consuleremus. Et quoniam licet saepe de statu Ecclesiarum, et
de ritibus praeterito tempore ordinassemus, et missos per singula loca
destinassemus, sed invidente Diabolo, per tyrannicam pravitatem praepeditum
fuisset, oportebat ut hoc tempus paucis indultum ad communem Sanctae Dei
Ecclesiae, et omnium nostrorum utilitatem impenderemus, tribus videlicet modis,
ut quae been inchoata erant, Deo auxiliante effectum obtinerent, et si quae
bona voluntate sed incauta discretione, variis praepedientibus causis, inchoata
fuissent, ut diligenter inspicerentur, et discrete, prout facultas suppetebat
corrigerentur, si quae etiam de his, quae necessaria erant, deesse videremus,
ut quaererentur, et Deo auxiliante ad effectum perducerentur, quatenus deinceps
opus nostrum a nemine just posset reprehendi, et tam nostris quam futuris
temporibus multorum saluti proficeret, et Deo opitulante stabile permaneret.
Sed qualiter de his divina cooperante gratia, consulta fidelium p^o viribus et
temporis brevitate, licet non quantum debuimus and voluimus, sed quantum a Deo
posse accepimus egerimus, et quid unicuique ordini communi voto, communique
consensu consulere studuerimus, ita ut quid Canonicis proprie de his, quidve
Monachis observandum, quid etiam in Legibus mundanis, quid quoque in Capitulis
inferendum foret adnotaverimus, et singulis singula observanda contraderemus.
Tamen ut sive nostris, sive successorum nostrorum temporibus rata forent, et
inviolabiliter Deo annuente conservarentur, libuit nobis ea quae gesta sunt, ob
memoriae firmitatisque gratiam, in unum strictim congerere, et subjectis
Capitulis annotare, et in publico archivo recondere, ut successores nostri Deo
dispensante, nostra pia facta conservantes, et ipsi nihilominus bona facta sua
successoribus suis servanda perdoceant. Amongst these Additio. 2. cap. 23.

Additional Laws this is one, specially recommended to the Emperor by this
Council, as a principal, part of his Kingly office, and duty; Quod in eligendis
and constituendis Pastoribus, rectoribusque in Ecclesiis Dei, Regem magnum
studium atque solertissimam vigilantiam et curam adhibere oporteat. Quia si
aliter factum fuerit, and ordo Ecclesiasticus suam non habebit dignitatem, and
Religio Christiana in multis labefactanda damna detrimenti sui patiatur, et
animae Regiae vestrae periculum generabitur. Moreover this pious Emperor, and
Charles the Great, Universos quoque Veteris ac Novi Testamenti libros,
librariorum imperitia, lectorum oscitantia, interpretum inscitia, and incuria
temporum depravatos, ad amussim et veritatem fontis correxit. Extat publicum
Capitula^ia Caroli and Ludovici, lib. 1. Tit. 20. and lib. ^. Tit. 227.
Decretum, ut Canonici libri tantum legantur in Ecclesia, nec sinit in divinis
Lectionibus templisque inter sacra officia, inconditos solae cismos, barbarismo
que inconcinnos obstrepere, in quibus quidam religiosuli nostra memoria,
sanctitatem collocant; as Annalium Boiorum. lib. 4. 283, 284.
Joannes Aventinus informs us.

All these particulars abundantly evidence the Supremacy of Charles the Great,
and Ludovicus his son, both as Kings and Emperors, in and over all
Ecclesiastical persons, causes, and Popes themselves during their reigns, and
that the care, protection, propagation of Religion, the Church, and their
peoples salvation, belonged principally to, and were managed by them, as the
chief branch of their Kingly office.

This Emperor Ludovicus Pius collected, published sundry Ecclesiastical Laws
and Constitutions, which he thus prefaced; Capitula^ia Karol. and Ludovici
Imperatoris, l. 2. c. 1. 2, 3, 4. Fredericus Lindebrogus, p. 858.
Omnibus vobis aut visu aut auditu notum esse non dubitamus, quia genitor
noster, and progenitores, postquam a Deo ad hoc electi sunt, in hoc praecipue
studuerunt, ut honor Sanctae Dei Ecclesiae, et status Regni decens maneret. Nos
etiam juxta modum nostrum eorum sequentes Exemplum, saepe vestram devotionem de
his admonere curavimus, et Deo miserante, multa jam emendata et correcta
videmus. Vnde et Deo justas lauds persolvere, and vestrae bonae intentioni
multimodas, debemus gratias refer. Sed quoniam complacuit divinae
providentiae nostram mediocritatem ad hoc constituere, ut sanctae suae
Ecclesiae et regni huius curam gereremus (observe it) ad hoc certare, et nos et
filios ac socios nostros diebus vitae nostrae optamus, ut tria specialiter
Capitula, et a nobis, et a vobis, Deo opem ferente, in hujus regni
administratione specialiter conserventur; id est, ut defensio et exaltatio vel
honor sanctae Dei Ecclesiae, et servorum illius congruus maneat, et pax, et
Iustitia in omni generalitate populi nostri conservetur. In his quippe maxim
studere, et de his in omnibus placitis quae vobiscum Deo auxiliante habituri
sumus, vos admonere optamus, sicut debitores sumus. Sed quanquam summa hujus
ministerii in nostra persona consistere videatur, tamen and divina authoritate,
and humana or sinatione, ita per parts divisum esse cogoscitur. Vnde apparet,
quod ego omnium vestrum admonitor esse debeo, et omnes vos nostri adiutores
esse debetis. Nec enim ignoramus, quid unicuique vestrum in sibi commissa
portione conveniat, and ideo praetermittere non possumus quin unumquemque juxta
suum ordinem admoneamus. Sed quoniam scimus, quod specialiter pertineat ad
Episcopos, ut primum ad sacrum ministerium suscipiendum just accedant, and in
eodem Ministerio religiose vivant, and tam been vivendo, quam recte praedicando
populis sibi commissis, it er vitae praebeant: and ut in Monasteriis in suis
Parochiis constitutis sancta religio observata fiat, unusquisque juxta suam
professionem veraciter vivat, curam impendant. Omnes vos in hoc sacro ordine
constitutos, et officio Pastorali functos, monemus atque rogamus, ut in hoc
maxim elaborare studeatis, et per vosmetipsos, et per vobis subjectos, quantum
ad vestrum ministerium pertinet, nobis very adjutores in administratione
ministerii nobis commissi existatis, ut in judicio non condemnari pro nostra
and vestra negligentia, sed potius pro utrorumque bono studio remunerari
mereamur. Et ubicunque per negligentiam Abbatis aut Abbatissae, vel Comitis,
sive See Fride^ici Lindebrogi Glossarium, ti^. Vassus.
vassi nostri, aut alicujus cujuslibet personae, aliquod vobis difficultatis in
hoc apparuerit obstaculum, nostrae dignoscentiae id ad tempus insinuare non
differatis, ut nostro aurilio suffulti, quod vestra auctoritas exposcit,
famulante, ut decet, potestate nostra, facilius perficere valeatis.

This pious King and Emperor employed Fridericus Lindebrogus Codex Legum
Antiquarum, p. 825, 826, etc.
Abbot Ansegisus to collect all his own, his Fathers King Charles the Great, and
other his Predecessors Ecclesiastical Laws (made by the advice of their Nobles
as well as Bishops) scattered in diverse Schedules, into one Volume, and to
present them to him, for the honor and good of the Church, who accordingly
collected, digested them into several Books, Chapters, entitled, Capitularia
Caroli Magni, and Ludovici, consisting of 7. Books, and near 1600 brief
Chapters or Constitutions, besides 4. Books of Additions to them, printed all
together in Francofurt: 1613.
Fridericus Lindebrogus his Codex Legum Antiquarum, wherein are comprised all
sorts of Laws, Canons, Constitutions relating to the Orthodox faith, worship,
service of God, Scriptures, Sacraments, all Ecclesiastical persons, duties,
matters, Christians whatsoever, to whom he prescribed these Laws, by his Royal
authority, (corrected, augmented by advice of his Nobles, as the Titles to each
Book declare) and sundry penalties, as having the principal care of the Church
and people of God committed to him, for which trust he was to give a strict
account at the day of Judgment. In his 7th. Book cap: 375, 376. he thus
ratified all the precedent Laws. Has omnes Constitutiones quas summatim
breviterque perstrinximus, sicut before in Canone continentur, manner perenni
stabilitate sancimus Si quis ergo Clericus aut Laicus harum sanctionum obediens
esse noluerit, si Clericus fuerit, excommunicationi subjaceat. Si vero Laicus
fuerit, and honestioris loci persona, medietatem facultatum suarum amittat,
fisci juribus profuturam: si vero majoris loci persona est, amissione rerum
suarum multatus, in exilio deputetur. Quaecunque a Parentibus nostris diversis
sunt statuta temporibus, manner inv^olata et incorrupta circa sacrosanctas
Ecclesias praecipimus. Nihil igitur a privilegiis immutetur, omnibus qui
Ecclesiis serviunt tuitio deferatur, Quia temporibus nostris addi potius
reverentiae cupimus, quam ex his, quae olim praestituta sunt, immutari.

he made this Law to prevent the tumults about elections of Popes: Volumus, ut
ad electionem Pontificis nemo audeat venire, neque liber, neque servus qui
aliquod impedimentu^ inferat, exceptis illis tantu^ Romany quibus antiqua fuit
consuetudo, per constitutionem Sanctorum Patrum, concessa eligendi Pontificem.

wherein they have this notable passage touching Princes Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction. Petimus, ut sicut apud antecessores vestros Reges atque
Imperatores, qui ante vos fuerunt, honorem sancta Dei Ecclesia habuit, and per
immunitatem eorum possessiones Ecclesiasticae inconvulsae perstiterunt,
manentesque in eis semper inlaesae perseveraverunt; ita apud vos modernis
temporibus incontaminatae permaneant. Zelo enum Dei oportet vos defendere
Ecclesias Christi, qui vobis Regnum in terra et dominationem tribuit, ut per
nullius suggestiones iniquas vestram concessionem quam in Eleemosynam vestram
Ecclesiis Christi contulistis, sinatis permutari. Quia inhonestum est ut hoc,
quod non solum Christianis temporibus a Christianis Imperatoribus, sed etiam a
Paganis regibus tempore Gentilitatis ad honorem Dei collatum est, vestris
temporibus in vestro Regno permutetur: Nam legimus apud Esdr. 7.
Esdram, quod Artaxerxes Rex Esdrae scribae legis Dei per Epistolam mandaverit,
Ego Artaxerxes, etc. De Christianis vero Regibus and Imperatoribus non necesse
est aliqua exempla ponere, cum omnes qui rectae fidei, et sani dogmatis
fuerint, a Constantino Imperatore, (qui primus Imperatorum Christianam
Religionem defendere, atque honorem Ecclesiarum Dei amplificare caepit) usque
ad vos, semper in hoc studio solerter laboraverint, ut Ecclesia Dei pacem et
tranquillitatem haberet, quatenus cultus Dei incontaminatus foret, et servi^e
jus sine impedimento, Deo delectabiliter deservirent. At the end of their last
Chapter they conclude with this Petition to the Emperor: Ibid. c. 31. p. 428.
Haec vero quae vobis transmissa sunt, petimus, ut vestra authoritate
firmentur. Et si quis adversarius illis existere voluerit, praevalere non
permittatur. Dei enim cooperatores vos esse debetis, et adjutores sanctae ejus
Ecclesiae, quatenns Religio Christiana incontaminata temporibus Regni vestri
usque ad finem servetur.

Jews and Lotharius commanded a general Fast to be kept throughout their
Realms, Anno 829.
to divert Gods warth and judgments, and likewise summoned 4. Councils, at
Paris, Mentz, Lions, and Tholose, to reform both in the Clergy and Laity,
Church and State, all sins, vices, errors, corruptions, contrary to Gods word,
which had brought plagues, wars, and other judgments on them, to appease Gods
wrath against them and their Subjects. Et quia nos magis in hoc peccasse
cognoscimus, qua forma salutis omnibus esse debuimus, et omnium curam gerere,
et per authoritatem Imperialem pravorum acta ne tantum adcrescerent, corrigere
cupimus, (write these Emperors in their summons of, and pious prologue to the
Council of Paris) wherefore, totius Ecclesiae sibi commissae (mark it)
generalitati consulere gestientes. they summoned these Councils to assist them
in this their general desired reformation. Consultu Episcoporum, Sacerdotum and
Optimatum caeterorumque fidelium nostrorum. Whereupon the Bishops and others
assembled in the Council of Paris, Orthodoxorum Principum jussionibus
obedientes, compiled several Constitutions and Rules for the reformation of
themselves and other Christians, which they digested into three Books. The
first, for the reformation of the corruptions, lives of Bishops, Priests,
Monks, abuses in Gods worship, and prophanations of the Lords day. The 2d.
describing the respective duties, and regulating the enormities of Kings, Civil
Magistrates, Officers, and sins of the people, in relation to Gods worship
and service. The 3d. relating both to Kings, Bishops, Priests and people.

In the 2d. Book they thus describe the office and duty of a King, Cap. 1. Quid
sit Rex, quid esse, quidque cavere debet. Surius Council. Tom. 3 p 389, to 393.
Centur, Magd. 9. c. 9.
Rex a recte agendo vocatur. Si enim pie, and just, and misericorditer regit,
merito, Rex appellatur: si his caruerit, non Rex, sed Tyrannus est, etc. Quia
ergo Rex a regendo dicitur, primo ei studendum est, ut semet ipsum suamque
domum, Christi adjuvante gratia, ab operibus nequam emaculet, bonisque operibus
exuberare faciat, ut ab ea caeteri subjecti bonum exemplum semper capiant; ipse
etiam salutiferis Christi praeceptis fideliter atque obedienter obsecundet, and
recte agendo eis quibus temporaliter imperat, in pace and concordia atque
charitate caeterorumque bonorum operum exhibitione, quantum sibi divinitus
datur, consistere faciat, et dictis atque exemplis ad opus pietatis et
justitiae, et misericordiae solerter excitet, attendens, quod pro his Deo
rationem redditurus sit, quatenus ita agendo sanctorum Regum, qui Deo sincere
serviendo, placuerunt, post hane peregrinationem consors efficiatur. De Rege
autem qualis esse, vel quid cavere debeat, Deuteronomy. 17.
ita in Deuteronomo legitur, Cum ingressus fueris terram, quam Dominus Deus
tuus dabit tibi, and possederis eam, habitaverisque in illa. et dixeris,
Constituam super me Regem, sicut habent omnes per circuitum Nationes: eum
constitues, quem Dominus Deus tuus elegerit de numero fratrum tuorum. Et post
pauca. Non habebit Uxores plurimas quae alliciant animum ejus, neque Argenti
and Auri immensa pondera. Postquam autem sederit in solio regni sui, describat
sibi Deuteronomium legis hujus in volumine, accipiens exemplar a Sacerdotibus
Leviticae tribus, and habebit secum, legetque illud omnibus diebus vitae suae,
ut discat timere Dominum Deum suum, and custodire verba, and Ceremonias ejus,
quae lege praecepta sunt: nec extolletur cor ejus in superbiam super fratres
suos, neque declinet in partem dextram vel sinistram, ut longo tempore regnet
ipse and filii ejus super Israel. Attend quod timor Dei and custodia
praeceptorum ejus, and humilitas, quae non patitur eum extolli super fratres
suos, and Justitiae rectitudo non solum Regem, sed and filios ejus longo faciet
regnare tempore, Ut ergo Princeps extollentiam cavere debeat: Ecclesiasticus
admonens ait, Eccles. 32.
Principem te constituerunt? noli extolli, sed esto in illis, quasi unus ex
ipsis. Prove. 29.
In Proverbiis, Rex qui Judicat in veritate pauperes, Thronus ejus in aeternum
firmabitur. Prove. 20.
Item, Misericordia and veritas custodiunt Regem, and roboratur Clementia
Thronus ejus. Quantae igitur foelicitatis sit bonus Rex, quantaeve
infoelicitatis si nequam fuerit; Beatus Cyprianus, eximius Martyr Christi, de
Duodecim abusionibus; Scribens, inter caetera ita ait, Nonus inquiens,
abusionis gradus est, Rex iniquus; etenim Regem non iniquum, sed correctorem
iniquorum esse oportet. Unde in semetipso nominis sui dignitatem custodire
debet. Nomen enim Regis intellectualiter hoc retinet, ut subjectis omnibus
rectoris officium procuret: sed qualiter alios corrigere poterit, qui proprios
mores, ne iniquisint, non corrigat? Quoniam Justitia Regis exaltatur solium,
and veritate solidantur gubernacula populorum, Justitia vero Regis est, neminem
injuste per potentiam opprimere, sine acceptione personarum inter virum and
proximum suum judicare: advenis and pupillis and viduis defensorem esse: furta
cohibere, adulteria punire, iniquos non exaltare, impudicos and histriones non
nutrire, impios de terra perdere, parricid is and pejcrantes vivere non sinere,
Ecclesias defendere, paup^res eleemosynis alere, justos super regni negotia
constituere, senes and sapientes and sobrios Consiliarios habere. Magorum and
hariolorum Pythonissarumque super stitionibus non intendere, iracundiam
differ, patriam and fortiter and just contra adversarios defendere, per
omnia in Deo vivere, prosperitatibus non elevare animum, cuncta adversa paenter
far, fidem Catholicam in Deum habere, filios suos non sinere impie agere,

certis horis orationibus insistere: ante horas congruas non gustare cibum: Vae
enim terrae, cujus Rex est puer, and cujus Principes mane comedunt. Haec regni
prosperitatem in praesenti faciunt, and Regem ad Coelestia regna meliora
perducunt. Qui vero secundum hanc Legem non dissensat, multas nimirum
adversitates imperii tolerat. (...) enim saepe pax populorum rumpitur, and
offendicula etiam de regno suscitantur, terrarum quoque fructus diminuuntur,
and servitia populorum praepediuntur; multi etiam dolores prosperitatem regni
inficiunt, ^harorum and liberorum mortes tristitiam conferunt, hostium incursus
provincias undique vastant, bestiae armentorum and pecorum greges dilacerant,
tempestates veris and hyemis terr^rum foecunditatem, and maris Ministeria
prohibent, and aliquando fulminum ictus segetes, and arborum stores, and
pampinos exurunt. Super omnia vero Regis injustitia non solum praesentis
Imperii faciem fuscat, sed etiam filios suos and nepotes, ne post se regni
haereditatem teneant, ^ Reg. 12.
obscurat. Propter piaculum enim Solomonis regnum domus, Israel Dominus de
manibus filiorum ejus dispersit, and propter meritum David Regis, lucernam de
semine ejus semper in Jerusalem reliquit. Ecce quantum justitia Regis seculo
valet, intuentibus perspicue patet; Pax populorum est, tutamentum patriae,
immunitas plebis, munimentum gentis, cura larguorum, gaudium hominum, temperies
atris, serenias maris, terrae foecunditas, solatium pauperum, haereditas
filiorum, and sibimetipsi^^^^ futurae beatitudinis. Attamen sciat, quod sicut
in Throno hominum primus constitutus est, sic et in poenis, si Iustitiam non
fecerit, primatum habiturus est. Omnes namque quoscunque peccatores sub se in
praesenti habuit, supra se modo in illa futura poena habebit. (After which they
insert the Here, p. 126, 127.
forecited passage of Fulgentius in Libro de veritate Praedestinationis and
Gratiae.) Lib. ^. Sententiarum cap. 49.
Isiodorus, Qui recte utitur regni potestate, ita praestare se omnibus debet,
ut quanto magis honoris celsitudine claret, tanto semetipsum mente humiliet.
Proponens sibi exemplum humilitatis David, qui de suis meritis non tumuit, sed
humiliter sese dejiciens, dixit; Vilis incedam, 2 Reg. 6.
and vilis apparebo ante Dominum qui elegit me. Item Isidorus. Qui intra
seculum been temporaliter imperat, Ibidem. c. 48.
sine fine in perpetuum regnat, and de Gloria seculi hujus ad a ternam
transmeat gloriam: qui vero prave regnum exercent, post vestem fulgentem and
lumina lapillorum, nudi and miseri ad inferna torquendi descendunt. Reges a
recte agendo vocati sunt, ideoque sicut recte agendo, Regis nomen tenetur, ita
peccando amittitur. Nam and viros sanctos proinde Reges vocari in sacris
eloquiis, eo quod recte agant, sensusque proprios been regant, and motus
resistentes sibi rationabili discretione componant. Recte igitur illi Reges
vocantur, qui tam semetipsos, quam subjectos been regendo modificare noverunt.
Quidam ipsum nomen regiminis ad immanitatem transvertunt crudelitatis; dumque
ad culmen potestatis venerint, in Apostasiam confestim labuntur: tantoque se
tumore cordis extollunt, ut cunctos subditos in sui comparatione despiciant,
cosque quibus praeesse contigit, non agnoscant. Et paulo post. Dum mundi Reges
^^blimiores se caeteris sentiunt, mortales tamen se esse agnoscant, nec regni
Gloriam, qua in seculo sublimantur, adspiciant: sed opus quod secum deportant,
intendant Item non post multa. Reges quando boni sunt, muneris esse Dei, quando
vero mali, sceleris esse populi. Secundum meritum enim plebium, disponitur vita
rectorum, testante Job: Job 34
Qui regnare facit hypocritam propter peccata populi. Irascente enim Deo, talem
Rectorem populi suscipiunt qualem pro peccato merentur. Nonnunquam pro malitia
plebis, etiam Reges mutantur, and qui ante videbantur esse boni, accepto regno
siunt iniqui. His ita praemissis, studendum est Regi, ut non solum in se, verum
etiam in sibi subjectis Regis nomen adimpleat: provideatque ut populus sibi
subjectus, pietate, pace, charitate, justitia et misericordia, atque concordia,
et unanimitate, ceterisque bonis exuberet operibus, ut haec habentes, Dominum
secum habere mereantur; sciatque certissime, quod non solum de se, verum etiam
de ipsis Dominus ab eo fructum bonae operationis exacturus est. After which
they thus proceed, Cap. 2. Quid sit proprie Ministerium Regis? Regale
Ministerium specialiter est populum Dei gubernare et regere cum aequalitate et
justitia, et ut pacem et concordiam habeant, studere: ipse enim debet primo
Defensor esse Ecclesiarum et servorum Dei, viduarum, orphanorum, caeterorumque
pauperum, necnon et omnium indigentium. Ipsius enim terror and studium
hujuscemodi in quantum possibile est, esse debet primo, ut nulla injusticia
fiat; deinde, si evenerit, ut nullo modo ea subsistere permittat, nec spem
delitescendi, sive audaciam male agendi cuiquam relinquat, sed sciant omnes,
quoniam si ad ipsius notitiam pervenerit quippiam mali quod admiserint,
nequaquam incorrectum and ^^ultum remanebit, sed juxta sacti qualitatem, erit
and modus justae correptionis. Quapropter in Throno regiminis positus est, 2
Par. 19
ad judicia recta peragenda, ut ipse per se provideat, and perquirat, ne in
judicio aliquis a veritate and aequitate declinet: Scire etiam debet, quod
causa quam juxta ministerium sibi commissum administrat, non hominum, sed Dei
causa existit, cui pro Ministerio quod suscepit, in examinis tremendi die
rationem redditurus est. Et ideo oportet, ut ipse qui Judex est Judicum, causam
pauperum ad se ingredifaciat and diligenter inquirat, ne forte illi, qui ab eo
constituti sunt, and vicem eius agere debent in populo, injuste aut negligenter
pauperis oppressiones pati permittant. Job 29.
De Ministerio autem Regis ita Job loquitur; Cum sederem quasi Rex circunstante
exercitu, eram tamen maerentium Consolator. Auris audiens beatificabat me, and
oculus videns testimonium reddebat mihi, quod liberassem pauperem vociferantem,
and pupillam cui non esset adjutor. Benedictio perituri super me veniebat, and
cor viduae consolatus sum: Justitia indutus sum, and vestivi me sicut
vestimento and Diademate judicio meo: Oculus fui caeco, and pes claudo: Pater
eram pauperum, and causam quam nesciebam diligentissime investigabam:
conterebam molas iniqui, Prove. 20.
and de dentibus illius auferebam praedam. Solomon: Rex qui sedet in solio
judicu dissipat omne malum intuitu suo. Eccl. 10.
Item, Prove: 29.
Dissipat impios Rex sapiens, and curvat super eos fornicem. Item, Judex
sapiens vindicabit populum suum, and principatus sensati stabilis est. Item,
Rex Justus erigit terram, and vir avarus destruit eam. Sap. ^.
In Libro Sapientiae. Diligite Justitiam, qui iudicatis terram, sentite de
Domino in bonitate, and simplicitate cordis quaerite illum. Item ibi. Audite
ergo Reges and intelligite, discite Judices finium terrae; praebete aures vos
qui continetis multitudines and placetis vobis in turbis Nationum, quoniam data
est a Domino vobis potestas and virtus ab altissimo, qui interrogabit opera
vestra, and cogitationes scrutabitur; quoniam cum essetis Ministeri ejus, non
recte judicastis, neque custodistis legem Justitiae, neque secundum Dei
voluntatem ambulastis; Horrende and cito apparebit vobis, quoniam judicium
durissimum in his qui praesunt, fiet; Exiguo enim conceditur misericordia:
Potentes autem potenter tormenta patientur: Non enim subtrahet personam
cujusquam Dominus; nec reverebitur cujusquam magnitudinem: quoniam pusillum and
magnum ipse fecit, et aequaliter pro omnibus cura est illi. Tortioribus autem
fortior instat cruciatus. See here, p 152.
Isiodorus. Principes seculi nonnunquam intra Ecclesiam potestatis adeptae
culmina tenent, ut per eandem potestatem disciplinam Ecclesiasticam muniant.
Caeterum intra Ecclesiam potestates necessariae non essent, nisi ut quod non
praevalet Sacerdos efficere per Doctrinae sermonem, potestas hoc imperet per
disciplinae terrorem. Saepe per regnum terrenum, Coeleste regnum proficit, ut
qui intra Ecclesiam positi contra fidem et disclplinam Ecclesiae agunt, rigore
principum conterantur ipsamque disciplinam quam Ecclesiae Humilitas.
utilitas exercere non praevalet, cervicibus superborum potestas principalis
imponat: et ut venerationem mereatur virtutem potestas impertiat. Cognoscant
Principes seculi Deo debere se reddere rationem propter Ecclesiam, quam a
Christo tuendam suscipiunt. Nam sive augeatur pax, and disciplina Ecclesiae per
fideles Principes, sive solvatur, ille ab eis rationem exiget, qui eorum
potestati suam Ecclesiam credidit. Sunt and alia utriusque testamenti cracula
copiosa, quibus affatim adstraitur, quod Rex Ministerium sibi commissum
secundum voluntatem Dei exercere and adimplere debet, quae hic ob prolixitatem
vitandum praetermittuntur. Cap. 3. De periculo Regis, and quod been agentes
remunerare, and male vero ag^ntes suae Authoritate comprimere, causamque
pauperum ad se ingredi debeat facere. And Cap. 4. Quod aequitas Judicii,
stabilimentum Regni, and ejus injustitia, sit ejus eversio: are worthy perusal
to these purposes, but overtedious to insert; I shall only recite some passages
of Cap. 5. Quod regnum non ab hominibus; sed a Deo, in cujus manu omnia regna
consistunt, d^tur. Nemo regum a progenitoribus regnum sibi administrari, sed a
Deo veraciter atque humiliter credere debet dari, etc. which they prove by
Prove. 8. 14, 15, 16. Dan. 4. 25. Dan. 5. 21. Jer. 27. 4, 5, 6. Hosea 8. 4. Job
34. 30. Isiodorus exponit, Irascente Deo, talem rectorem populi suscipiunt,
qualem pro peccato merentur. Constat ergo quia non actu, non voto, neque
brachio fortitudinis humanae, sed virtute, imo occulto Judicio dispensationis
divinae regnum confertur terrenum. Et idcirco cuicunque ab eo committitur, ita
illud secundum ejus voluntatem disponere et gubernare procuret, quatenus cum
eo, a quo illud suscepit, feliciter, in perpetuum regnare valeat; quoniam nihil
prodest cuipiam terreno regno principari, si (quod absit) contigerit eum
aeterno extortem fieri. After which description of a Kings office and duty,
they thus humbly submit all their Constitutions and Resolves in this Council to
the Emperors wills, and desire their confirmation of them so far as they
should think expedient, as these passages evidence; Surius, Tom. 3. p. 402, 415.

Agobardus Episcopus Lugdunensis, Anno 830.
begins his refutation of the heretical position of the deposed Felicis
Orgellitani Episcopi, (dedicated to Ludovicus Pius the Emperor) with this
Prologue; Christianorum religiosissimo, Christi amatori, ideoque victori ac
triumphatori piissimo, Augusto, Domino gloriosissimo Ludovico Imperatori. Pie
igitur, and Domine Rector, CAPUT ORBIS, decus mundi, Catholicorum omnium
insignis gloriatio, qui illustratis fidem, Propagatis et pacem. Obsecro
mansuetudinem vestram, ut in contemplationem Filii Dei, qui vestrum juvat
imperium, praefatum Opusculum perlustrare non dedignemini, ut vestro acerrimo
judicio probetur, aut improbetur: quia si probatur, illis quibus profuturum
est, ad legendum commendatur: si autem improbatur, auctor eius per vos
emendatur. If this learned Bishop thus wholly submitted his Treatise concerning
one of the highest points of Faith (to wit, the Unity of the two Natures of
Christ in one person) to this Emperors approbation, correction, or rejection,
and gave him these Titles, no doubt he esteemed him the supreamest Judge
thereof. Moreover, he dedicated to him his Treatises Ibid: p. 562, 563, 564.
De insolentia Judaeorum, and De Judaicis superstitionibus, Quem Deus
omnipotens, and praeordinavit Rectorem pium (Ecclesiae suae) futurum temporibus
valde necessariis, sublimaverit prudentiam vestram, and studium Religionis
super caeteros vestri temporis mortales; (whether Popes or Bishops) unde dubium
non est praeparari vos ad remedium temporibus periculosis. Cum haec igitur ita
se habeant, obsecro tranquillissimam longanimitatem vestram, ut praebeatis
patientissmam aurem vestram, vicibus quibus ego infimus servorum vestrorum,
minus necessarium puto esse admonendam sanctissimam sollicitudinem vestram de
re tam necessaria, quae aut sola, aut praecipua est, cui prae caeteris
succurrere debeat gubernatio vestra etc. Et quidem si (sicut nunc multa
necessitas poscit) ausi essemus aut val^issemus, auribus vestris ingerere damna
animarum quae per vasa Diaboli, fidelibus inseruntur, adhiberi animis juberet
pietas vestra remedium; Making it one principal part of his Imperial office,
care, trust, to suppress all Heresies, Blasphemies, and Jewish Superstitions
repugnant to the Scriptures, the Honor of God, the De^y of Jesus Christ, and
prejudicial to his peoples souls. He wrote two Treasuses to this Emperor, Ibid.
p. 571. 572. 604.
Contra damnabilem opinionem putantium, Divini Judicii veritatem, igne, vel
aqua, vel conflictu armorum patefieri; desiring him to take away such trials,
as unjust, unreasonable, unchristian, and against the word of God.

France about the year 833, Anno 833
with an intention (as Ludovicus suspected) to raise up a Civil War, and join
with Lotharius his son (conjoined with him in the Empire) to deprive him;
this Emperor summoned Agobardus, amongst other Bishops siding with Lotharius,
to appear before him; who refusing to appear, thereupon the Emperor called an
Assembly of such French Bishops as sided with him against Agobardus, Bibl.
Patr. Tom 9. pars 1 p. 512.
Cujus haec fuerunt capita adversum ipsius contumaciam, pro co^firo a^do
Gallicana liberate. 1. Episcopum Romanum vocandum Papam, Fratrem, non autem
Patrem, neque Pontificem. 2. Imperialem potestatem plus posse in administranda
Ecclesia quam Pontificem. 3. Caesarem non dehonestandum praesumptuosa
excommunicatione. 4. Posse unum aliquem Pontificem abjici sine injuria sedis
Apostolicae. 5. Episcopos in causa fidei Iusjurandum praestare solitos
Imperatori. 6. Agobardum Primatum Aquitaniae, nullam deinceps habituram
potestatem in excommunicando, nullamque Iurisdictionem in caeteras Parochias,
si obediret potius Pontifici quam Caesari. 7. Privandum Episcopum consortio et
honor, qui potius Pontificis quam Ecclesiae Gallicanae Concilio obediret. In
answer whereunto, Agobardus writ two particular Treatises, wherein he
endeavored, as far as he could, to answer these particulars, excusing his not
appearing, by reason of the public tumults, and to diminish the Emperors
Supremacy, as subordinate in some sense, to the Pontifical Jurisdiction; which
Treatises he dedicated and sent to the Emperor. In his Treatise Bibliotheca
Patrum, Tom. 9. p. 616.
De Comp^ratione utriusque Regiminis, Ecclesiastici and Politici, and in quibus
Ecclesiastica dignitas praefulgeat Imperiorum Majestati, though he maintains
the Popes Supremacy in some respects; yet he expressly resolves; Certe
clementissime Domiae, si nunc Gregorius Papa irrationabiliter, and ad pugnandum
venit, merito et pugnatus, et repulsus recedet; si autem pro quiet and pace
populi and vestra laborare nicitur, been and rationab^later obtemperandum est,
illi non repugnandum. Si enim quod vestra voluntate, et potestate, cum consensu
Imperii vestri factum est, and postea in Apostolica sede roboratum, hoc vult in
pristinum reducere statum, satis rationabilis and oportunus est ejus adventus.
Quia nullatenus quod ita est constitutum a vobis, debetis mutare; nec enim sine
gravi periculo, et reatu animae fieri potest in his sacratissimis diebus
Paschalibus. He concludes thus, Quia nemo dubitat de nullo alio opere
potestatis, tam chare Deum placare, quam de sollicitudine et administratione
Pacis et unitatis Ecclesiae, vestra solertissima Religio elaboret, ut omnis
anima fidelis proficeat in fide et cognitione Dei, quae res omnibus rebus Deo
cha^^or est, hujus rei nisus merita vestra appropinquare faciat Apostolicis
meritis.

Synodus Aquisgranensis summoned by the Emperor Ludovicus Pius Anno 833. Anno
833
gave him this account of their proceedings. Ibi de statu Sanctae Ecclesiae,
admonente Serenissimo atque totius religionis devotissimo praefato Imperatore
(Ludovico) tractare caepissemus: Revolutis igitur a vestra nobis benignissima
devotione, collatis tribus Capitulis, id est, ut ventilarentur, etc. Vestram
siquidem nihilominus supplici admonitione and affectu charita^is excellentiam
admonentes, si quae sunt Ecclesiastici juris vestra piissima gubernatione
erigenda, ut per vos vestrosque Christianae Religionis commilitones,
subleventur, etc. Haec nos fideles, and devotissimi famuli and Oratores vestri,
juxta parvitatem sensus nostri, secundum sanctam ordinationem vestram, de his
quae ad nostram, and consacerdotum subjectorumque nostrorum correctionem and
emendationem pertinere pers^eximus, etc. Sed nunc quia de his quae praemissa
sunt, vestro ardentissimo desiderio prius satisfacere studuimus, illud tamen
quod ad vestram specialiter personam ministeriumque pertinere cognoscimus,
nullatenus oblivioni tradidimus, sed potius vestrae saluti prospicientes,
nonnulla capitula necessaria fideliter collegimus; and vobis familiaeriter
admonitionis gratia devoteque porrigenda devovimus. Similiter quaedam ad filios
vestros pertinentia, quaedam vero ad commilitones vestros non minus
pertinentia. Which Constitutions commonly begin thus; being far from
arrogating any supreme Legislative, or Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction to
themselves, but ascribing all to the Emperor, Petimus humiliter Excellentiam
vestram, etc. Rogamus etiam vestram Pietatem propter divinam misericordiam,
vestramquesalutem. Et hoc humiliter admonemns. Innotescimus vobis, quod ea quae
in Capitulis vestris nobis tractanda commisistis, etc. Vestram interea Deo
amabilis Auguste petimus clementiam. Similiter est postulandum. Meminimus in
pesteriis Conventibus nonnulla capitula ab Episcopis vestra admonitione fuisse
tractata, atque statuta, pro necessitate, and communi salute, utrorumque
ordinum, Ecclesiasticorum scilicet and secularium, sed nescimus quibus
impedientibus obstaculis, quasi oblivioni tradita. Ideoque affectu devo^o
supplici admonitione admonemus, and admonendo precamur, ne ista quae nunc licet
perpaucae praelibavimus, ad statum Sanctae Dei Ecclesiae, simili modo oblivioni
tradantur, sed prospeculo omnibus inconvulsa habeantur atque conserventur, etc.
All they concluded being invalid without his imperial Sanction, and care to see
the same put in due execution.

Jonas Aurelianensis Episcopus has this memorable passage concerning Charles
the Great, and Ludovicus Pius the Emperors diligence, to protect and instruct
the Church of God committed to their care, not the Popes; Obeunte piae
memoriae, pio Principe Carolo, Ecclesiam i^em inclytus filius ejus (nutu
divino) regendam tuendamque suscepit. Ejusdem piissimi Principis solertissimo
studio, Ecclesia ita quotidie, Domino opitulante, ad meliora succrescit, ut
omnibus sacrae fidei perspicuum sit, eam et in fidei synceritate salubriter
roborari, et in cognitione divinarum Scripturarum sapienter dilatari, et
spiritualiter fructificari, etc. Quia igitur idem clarissimus Deo Princeps,
divinoque before amore succensus, and coelesti gratia adjutus (Ludovicus)
eandem Ecclesiam sibi traditam instanter erudit, armisque spiritalibus munit,
et dictis et exemplis incessanter ad alta sustollit, dignum est, ut sicut Pater
illius (Carolus) Magistri ejusdem Claudii (Tauronensi Episcopi) adhibita
sanctarum Scripturarum auctoritate damnavit errorem; ita nihilominus iste
gloriosus filius ejus (Ludovicus) nulli pietate, sapientia, fortitudine and
puritate secundus; discipuli ejusdem Felicis (Urgilitanensis Episcopi) vesanias
damnet blasphemias, divinarumque Scripturarum telis confodiat, ECCLESIAMQUE
SIBI COMMISSAM, Christo secum regnante, ab his et huiuscemodi erroribus immunem
liberamque reddat. Quod quidem qualiter ejus pio sagacissimoque studio actum
sit, Anno 8^6

Jonas Aurelianensis, in his Praefatio, Opusculo Carolo Regi porrecto, adversus
Haeresim Claudii Praesulis Taurinensis, (which he writ at the command of his
Father Ludovicus Pius the Emperor) gives this character of his religious zeal
and care to defend the Faith and Church of Christ committed to his Government
(not the Popes.) Quantus, Dominus noster gloriosissimus genitor vestor, Deo
dilectissimus Ludovicus Caesar, religiosissimus, in fidei synceritate, totius
bonitatis virtute, proborum morum claritu line, sapientiae and sanctitatis
dote, divinique amoris ac favoris fervore, et in Ecclesiasticis negotiis
(Domino administrante) ad honorem et cultum divinum pertinentibus augmentandis,
et gubernandis emineret, quantumque Ecclesiam Christi precioso sanguine
redemptam, SUOQUE REGIMINI DIVINITUS COMMISSAM (motum Patris tui videlicet pii
and omonymi, Caroh nobi^issimi Augusti imitatus, imo supergrediens) disciplina
liberal^um artium educaverit, et utriusque testamenti sancti paginis, atque
eximiorum Patrum dictis, ad propellenda haereticorum dogmata venenata, et
instrurerat, et instrui fecerit, cunctis Catholicae Apostolicae que fidei
filiis perspicuum esse non ambigitur; quoniam revera id quod dicitur in promptu
esse cernitur. Is namque Deo dilectissimus Princip^, inter cae^era bonitatis,
suae studia, erga divinum cultum amplificandum multiplici modo ferventia,
quendam Presbyterum, etc. ut Ital^cae plebis (quae magna ex part: a sanctorum
Evang^listarum sensibus procul aberant) sanae doctrinae consultum ferret
Taurinensi, praesulem subrogari fecit Ecclesiae, etc. Then giving him an
account of his Book against Claudius, he thus prostrates it to his correction.
Quicquid minus responsum, minusque praemissis pravis objectis contractum
repererit, suae sanioris uberiorisque intelligent^ae scriptis et dictis, ob
honorem et defensionem sanctae Dei Ecclesiae, suppleat.

memorable passage; Nec vos cuilibet ita vos subjiciatis, ut ad ejus arbitrium
omnia faciatis: cur enim regium nomen praetenditis, si regnare nescitis? Ut
pace cunctorum dixerim, non expedit vobis et populo, ut aliquem vobis aequetis,
(whether Pope or Bishop) nedum praeponatis, etc. Si filiis hoc non est
concedendum, quanto minus aliis? VICEM VOS GERERE DEI QUIS IGNORANT? At ipse
dicit, Gloriam meam alicui non dabo. Non admittentur ergo a vobis, monitores
quos bejulos vulgus appellat, etc. Nem^tuatis Potentes, and quos cum vultis
extenuare potestis. Therefore neither Popes, nor Prelates; both made, deposed by
Emperors and Kings.

Monasteriis virginum seu foeminarum, quae secundum regulam Sancti Benedicti,

Quicquid in praefatis ordinibus extra ordinem est, aut per negligentiam

Dei voluntatem vestrumque sanctum consilium, sic emendare desidero, ut in

piety, and the spirit of God dwelling in him, yet this extended not to his
Successors, especially to such who were devils incarnate in their actions. 3ly.
That the Scripture never called the Pope, nor St. Peter, God; much less made
either of them a God in truth: but it particularly, frequently styles Kings,
and Temporal Judges (Gods Vicegerents on earth, 2 Chronicles: 9. 8. 2 Chronicles: 19 6,
7. Prove: 8 15. Psalm: 88. 1.
sitting in his throne, executing Judgment and Justice in his stead) Gods; to
wit, in a qualfyed sense, not in reality and essence. Exodus 4. 16. c. 7. 1. c.
22. 28. Josh. 22. 22. Ps. 82. 1, 6. Ps. 136. 2. Ps. 138. 1. 1 Cor. 8. 5.
Therefore they being thus frequently called Gods by God himself in sacred Writ;
may lawfully judge, condemn, depose Popes and Priests, who are but men, and
never styled Gods in Scripture. 4ly. Kings being thus styled Gods, and sitting
on Gods Throne, the Pope who is but a man, and sits only in St. Peter's chair at
most, not Gods own throne; has not the least power or pretext (by this Popes
own argument, inference) to judge, much less depose, dethrone these Gods, as
they have most John Squire, Exposit. on 2 Thessalonians. 2. v. 3, 4. Sermon 8.
antichristianly presumed. 5ly. Sundry Emperors, Kings notwithstanding this
style of God given to the Pope by Constantine, did See Centur. Magd. 5. to 13
cap. 7, 9, 10. p. 329, 330.
frequently before and after Pope Nicholas his time both judge and depose
Popes, Patriarchs, Metropolitans, Bishops, Priests, for their Heresies,
Treasons, Schisms, rebellions, and other crimes, as the premised and subsequent
examples and Ecclesiastical Histories evidence. This therefore is a nonsense
argument for a Pope, especially in his own case, to exempt himself from the
Emperors Supreme Jurisdiction. 6ly. His exempting all inferior Clergymen, as
well as Bishops, Popes from Emperors, Kings, and Civil Magistrates censures,
powers, though Constantine never styled them Gods, is an argument, that every
Priest whatever, is as much a God, as the Pope himself in this respect, and
equal to him in Authority; which subverts Popes pretended Sovereign Monarchy,
and sole Deity, appropriated only to those who sit in Peter's imaginary, but
John Squire on 2 Thessalonians. 2. v. 3, 4. Sermon 8, 9, 10. Dr. Downham ham de

Archbishop of Coler, and Thetgandus Treverersis, for approving the divorce of
the Emperor Lotharius from Thetberga for incest with her brother, in the Synod
of Mus, after long attendance at Rome, were by this Pope Nicholas imprisoned,
deposed, excommunicated, without sight, hearing, reason, or cause alleged,
against all rules of Justice: who complaind to the Emperor of this his Tyranny,
and likewise writ a notable Epistle to him in answer to his Letter, after their
release, in their own names, behalfs, and their fellow Bishops, in
justification of the Emperor and themselves, against his pretended supremacy
over them: wherein they have these passages amongst others; Subito and de
inproviso sententiam injustam, temerariam, nefaviam, Christianae religioni
repugnantem, de chartulae effutisti, satis proterve tuis fratribus, atque
conservis illusisti, etc. Tu Pontificis quidem personam prae te fers, at
Tyranum agitas; sub cultu Pastoris Lupum sentimus. Titulus Parentem mentitur,
tu te factis Jovem ostentas. Cum sis Servus servorum, Dominus dominantium esse
contendis, atque juxta disciplinam Christi Servatoris nostri infimus ejus

quicquid tibi libet, licet. Fucus factus (...) Christianis. Hisce de causis nos
cum fratribus nostris and collegis, neque Edictis tuis stamus, neque vocem tuam
agnoscimus, neque tuas Bullas, tonittuaque timemus. ^u eos qui Senatus

interdicis. Nos tuo te ense jugulamus, qui edictum Domini Deique nostri
conspuis, concordiam collegii discindis, pacem, immortalem coelestis Principis
tesieram, violas. Spiritus sanctus author est omnium Ecclesiarum, qua
longissime and latissime terrarum orbis porrigitur. Civitas Dei nostri cujus

This Pope presumed to send this insolent Letter to this Emperor Lotharius, to
deprive him of his ancient Right of conferring Archbishopricks and Bishoprics,
without the Popes consent, which his Predecessors durst not attempt, prefaced

who for his Treason against the Emperor Ludovicus Pius, to deprive him of the
Empire, and thrust him into a Monastery, was deprived of his Archbishopric,
upon the Emperors complaint against him in Synodo apud Theodonis Villam, but
after Ludovicus his death, restored to it by Lotharius, with whom he
confederated) the Kings of France having an ancient Right and Prerogative
annexed to their Crowns, to confer all Archbishopricks and Bishoprics within
their Realms, to grant Licenses to elect them to the Clergy and people, and to
approve or reject them when elected, as Archbishop Hincmarus informs us, in his

This Archbishop Hincmarus in his Epistola 1. ad Ludovicum Balbum Regem, c. 9.
resolves thus: Bibl. Patrum Tom. 9. pars 2. p. 43, 44, 45, 46, etc.
Solicit unicutque ambulandum est cum Deo suo, et Regi praecipue, qui sub
tantis erit poenis in futuro saeculo, si malus fuerit, super quantos fuit in
isto saeculo, in quo se a malitia non correxit, et non fecit judicium et
justitiam, et non ambulavit solicit cum Deo suo. And in his Epistola 2. ad
Carolum Crassum Imperatorem, he exhorts and entreats him: Vt Ecclesiam
Gallicanam pene collapsam restituatis, vestrique sapienti consilio, et
potestatis auxilio relevetis, etc. Then showing him the means to effect it, he
concludes: Si enim Domine mi Rex, hujus Regni Ecclesia, et ministri ejus, ac
populus haec per vos obtinuerint, quantam mercedem et remunerationem inde apud
Deum, et bonum nomen apud saeculum habebitis, ex verbis Apostoli pensare
potestis, Jam. 5. 20. Si ergo Apostolus spiritu Dei plenus de uno peccatore
converso tantam remunerationem praemittit, colligat sapientia vestra, quantam
de tantorum salute ac profectu remunerationem apud Deum habebitis. Epistola 3.
and 4. he prescribes many excellent rules, pro recta novi and juvenis Regis
institutione, making the care and defense of Religion, and the Church, the
suppression of all heresies and sins, the principal part of a Kings Office;
observing, that 2 Par. 23.

Pope A rian the 2d. writing to this Archbishop Hincmaerus, to excommunicate
Charles the Balde K. of France, for seizing upon the Realm of Lotharius, to
send Hincmarus Laudanensis Episcopus, and other Bishops of France to a Synod at
Rome, and enjoining him several other things, to the prejudice of the Rights of
the Crown and Church of France: thereupon he communicated his Letter to the
other Bishops, King and Nobles of France, and writ a memorable Epistle to this
Pope in answer thereunto; wherein amongst other things, he informs him, That
K. Charles and others denied the matter, fact wherewith he was charged, as
false, averring the quite contrary for verity: That, nec legali nec regulari
judicio convictus apparerent: Nos vero querquam (though the meanest Peasant) a
communione prohibere non possumus, quinimo haec prohibitio non sit mortalis,
sed medicinalis, nisi aut sponte consessum, aut aliquo, sive saeculari, sive
Ecclesiastico judicio nominatum aut convictum; much less then could he
excommunicate his King, it being contrary to the Canons of the Council of
Africa, where St. Angustine was present; yea to the very Laws, Canons, Decrees
of the Sea Apostolic, and Popes themselves, there cited by him: That the
Nobles and French Bishops, to whom he had showed his Letter, affirmed, That
Popes did not excommunicate K. A^stulphus, or Desiderius King of the Lombards,
who invaded their possessions in Italy: Neither did this Kings Grandfather
Pipin, nor Father K. Charles, conquer them, and restore the Pope and Church to
their Right, Excommunicatione Apostolica, sed virtute hostili: Dicunt etiam,
secularem scripturam dicere, quia omne Regnum saeculi hujus bellis quaeritur,

obtinetur: and Scripturam divinam proponunt dicere, Prove. 8. 15.

adjutorium, nolite quaere nostrum dis^iendium; and petite Dominum Apostolicum,
ut quia Rex et Episcopus simul esse non potest, and sui antecessores
Ecclesiasticum ordinem, quod suum eu, et non Rempublicam, quod Regum est,
disposuerunt; non praecipiat nobis habere Regem, qui nos in sic lo^g^nquis
partibus adjuvare non possit contra subitanto; et frequentes Paganorum impetus
et nos Francos non jubeat servire, cui nolumus servire: quia istud jugum sui
antecessores nostris antecessoribus non imposuerunt: et nos illud portare non
possumus, qui scriptum esse in sanctis libris audimus, ut pro liberate et
haereditate nostra usque ad mortem certare debeamus, etc. Non convenit ulli
Episcopo dicere, ut Christianum, qui non est incorrigibilis, non propter
propria crimina, sed pro terreno Regno alicui tollendo vel acquirendo, nomine
Christianitatis debeat privare, cum cum diabolo collocare, quem Christus sua
morte, and suo sanguine de potestate Diaboli venit redimere, and Christianos
pro fratribus suis ani^as suas docuit ponere. Propterea si Dominus. Apostolicus
vult pacem quaerer, sic pacem quaerat, ut rixam non moveat: quia non nos
concredemus, ut aliter ad Regnum Dei pervenre non possimus, si illum, quem ipse
commendat, terrenum Regem non habuerimus. After which rendering many substantial
reasons why he neither could nor ought to obey his command in excommunicating
K. Charles, or withdrawing himself from all communion with him, upon his Papal
command, he subjoyns, Consulendum qualiter nos Episcopi, and egopraecipue, in
quem tantam comminationem intentastis, erga Regem nostrum gerere debeamus; cum
beatus Augustinus, Apostoli exponens sententiam, dicat: Apostolica dominatio,
Romans 13.
et omnis anima sublimioribus potestatibus subdita sit, 1 Pet. 2.
etc. Et beatus Petrus dicit: Subjecti estote omni humanae creaturae propter
Dominum, sive Regi, quasi praecellenti, etc. Omni humanae creaturae, inquit
Doctor sagacissin us, omni dignitati hominum, omni personae, omni principatui,
cui vos divina dispositio subdi voluerit. Hoc est enim quod ait: Propter
Dominum, quia non est potestas, nisi a Deo: and qui potestati resistir, Dei
ordinationi resistit. Item S. Augustinus Sermon Evangelii Johannis, etc. Noli
dicere, quid mihi and Regi? Noli dicere possessiones tuas, quia ad ipsa humana
jura renunciasti, quibus possidentur possessiones (Ecclesiae.) Et si per jura
Regum possidebunt (Episcopi) possessiones, non possunt ut Regi de
Ecclesiasticis possessionibus obfequium non exhibeant, sicut antecessores mei
suis antecessoribus exhibuerunt. Quapropter Domine Pater reverendissime,
consulite secundum privilegium sedis vestrae, subjectioni nostrae, netalia
nobis cujuscunque suggestione mandetis, unde inter Episcopalem auctoritatem et
Regalem potestatem, inter Ecclesiam et Rempublicam tantum scandalum possit
oriri, quod facile ac sine dispendio religionis, vel detrimento
Ecclesiasticarum rerum, unde servi, and ancillae Dei debeant nutriri, and
Ecclesiastica negotia contineri postea non possit sedari, etc. De eo, quod
pusillitati meae vestra rescripsit sublimitas, ut eundem Hincmarum, and alios
tres Episcopos omnium Episcoporum Regni, Domini Caroli vicem ferentes, ad
Synodum Romam mitterent: Vestra sciat auctoritas, quia nec praedictum
Hincmarum, nec etiam quemlibet Episcoporum Diocaescos Remorum, minime autem
aliarum Provinciarum Episcopos, nisi Dominus Rex illis praeceperit, Romam, vel
in aliquam partem, mea commendatione, mittendi habeo potestatem, nec ipse ego

of the French Kings Ecclesiastical Supremacy. He writ Extant in Bibl. Patrum,

At the same time there fell out a great difference between Charles King of
France and Pope Adrian, Anno 870.
who writ a most insolent, imperious, scurrilous Letter to him; whereupon he
returned this notable reply, in an Epistle to this Pope, (penned, as I
conceive, by Archbishop Hincmarus, being printed with his Epistles) answering
all the clauses of his unchristian Libel.

benigna and pacifica atque honorabilia nobis scripta impetrare nequivimus, ut
quietam pacis venerationem, quam apud antecessores vestros nostri decessores
and nos habuimus, quoquomodo obtinere possemus: Scripsimus vobis per Actardum
Episcopum, and mansuetudinis nostrae legatum, singillatim ac viritim, quam
inconvenientia pro Hincmaro quondam Laudunensi Episcopo, ex nomine vestro nobis
scripta fuerunt, quae nos a vobis processisse non credebamus, putantes nos
ratione comperta ab incompetentibus, quae aliorum instinctu nobis eatenus
scripta fuerunt, calamum revocare. Sed spe vana frustratis, aliter nobis quam
sperabamus evenit. In capite quippe Literarum, quas per praefatum Actardum
Episcopum nobis vestra direxit paternitas, auditam laudabilem charitatis and
sapientiae nostrae magnitudinem, vos praetulisse invenimus, and mox de comperto
murmr, and tumultuoso clamore indebitae reprehensionis adversus paternitatem
vestram nos denotatos, reperimus: sicque auditam nostram sapientiam
collaudastis, ut quasi honestius, and revera onustius, nos solitis contumeliis
afficere volueritis, quem non per insipientiam, sed per industriam in
murmuratione and clamore contra debitam charitatem delinquere demonstrabitis,
and quasi ad ora vasculi melle illiti, and de eodem font, quo and ante missae
Literae istae posteriores, nobis perniciosum poculum propinaverunt, fatentes
illa, quae aliorum instinctu, and non a vobis processisse credamus, vestra
fuisse.

Nam in praecedentibus Literis nos perjurum, tyrannum, ac perfidum, and
distractorem rerum Ecclesiasticarum, non confessum nec ordine judiciario
legaliter ac regulariter convictum, vocastis: in istis autem murmurationis
crimen nobis impegistis, and tumultuosi clamoris naevum imposuistis, arguente
Domino carnalem Israel per Prophetam, Ephesians. 4:
unde nos coarguitis, Quia non fecerit judicium, sed clamorem. Et Apostolus,
Omnis, inquit, clamor and indignatio tollatur a vobis. Et non levius malum est
murmuratio, 1 Cor. 10.
his quibus nos antea denotastis, dicente Apostolo, Neque murmuraveritis, sicut
quidam illorum murmuraverunt, and a serpentibus perierunt. Et ut beatus dicit
Gregorius, Nullus murmurans Regnum Dei intrare permittitur. Hinc colligendum
est, quantum peccatum sit murmuratio quae Regnum Dei intercludit. Sicut and
illa peccata gravia, Gal. ^.
post quorum enumerationem dicit Apostolus, Qui talia agunt, Regnum Dei non
possidebunt. Et non ut scripsistis tumultuoso clamore paternitatem vestram
indebite reprehendimus, sed quae nobis ex vestro nomine scripta fuerunt, non
multorum vocibus quibus tumultus fieri solet, sed nostra tantum voce
rescripsimus. Et quoniam talia vos misisse and a sancta Romana Ecclesia, in
omnibus semper discretissima atque cautissima, dictata fuisse, nequaquam
credidimus; Quia ipsa sancta seeds cum modestia and discretione semper
corripere, and salubriter corrigere, secundum uniuscujusque personam and
ordinem solita fuit suggessimus. Joan. 18.
Igitur si male locuti sumus, testimonium perhibete de malo; si autem been,

pro modulo nostro in hoc exemplum secuti, qui non dedignatus ex ratione
ostendere se peccatorem non esse, qui ex virtute divinitatis poterat peccatores
justificare; de his quae in nobis non recognovimus humiliter and patienter apud
paternitatem vestram nos excusavimus, ne, si penitus taceremus, tales; quales
denotabamur, tacendo and consentiendo esse nos fateremur; and quasi confessi
and nostra confessione convicti judicaremur.

Et hoc hortamentum, quod in literis ex nomine vestro ab Actardo Episcopo nobis
delatis invenimus, scilicet, ut omnia, quae a sede Apostolica nobis ve^^nt,
humili semper debeamus intention recipere, non solum, ut praemisimus,
Evangelicae veritati, sed etiam decretis sanctorum invenitur adversum. In
quorum decretis legimus, Eum absolvi non posse, Con. Val. can. 4
qui in seipsum dixerit mortis causam, qua edicta in alium puniretur, falsum
videlicet testimonium: cum omnis, qui sibi fuerit mortis causa, major homicida
sit. Et hinc decreverunt, Ut quicunque sub ordinatione, vel Diaconatus, vel
Presbyterii, vel Episcopatus, mortali crimine dixerint se esse pollutos, a
supradictis ordinationibus submovendos. Et nos, si ad talia nobis impacta
tacendo consentiremus, non solum a regimine regio, verum and a Catholicae
Ecclesiae communione nos ipsos sequestraremus. Non igitur talia nobis ex part
sedis Apostolicae and nomine vestro scripta, mente alacri percipere, and animo
grato amplecti, and humili semper debemus intention recipere, Eccles. 12.
quae, sicut in eisdem literis ex sententia sapientis Salomonis subjungitur,
Quasi stimuli, Eccles. 1^
and sicut clavi in altum defixi esse viderentur: quia culpas delinquentium
nesciunt palpare, 3 Reg. 12.
sed pungere. Cui sententiae item Sapientis verba referimus, quibus dixit: 2
Reg. 7.
Priusquam interroges, ne vituperes quenquam; and cum interrogaveris, id est,
probaveris; corripe just, sicut Nathan David regem prius interrogavit, and
interrogatione probatum corripuit: and cum causa correptionis defuit, humiliter
adoravit, veluti in sacra historia legimus. Mandate et scribite, quae vestro et
nostro ministerio congr^^mt, ut decessores vestri nobis et nostris decessoribus
mandaverunt, atque scripserunt, and alacri mente, gratoque animo recipiemus.

Literae autem ex nomine vestro semper sine interrogatione, id est, sine
probatione nos pungunt, and peccata, pro quibus invitum pungunt, sponte
confessa, vel ordine judiciario legaliter ac regulariter comprobata non
ostendunt, and cum peccata manifesta and probata desint, fomentis benignae
adhortationis and allocutionis non refovent: reprehendente hinc Domino
populorum rectores asperos, atque dicente, Vos autem cum austeritate
imperabatis eis, Ezech. 34.
and cum potentia. Quibus Apostolus regulam dedit commonitionis, 2 Timothy 4.
singulis dicens: Argue, obsecra, increpa in omni patientia and doctrina:
misceas temporibus tempora, terroribus blandimenta: Dirum magistri, pium patris
ostendentes affectum, id est, indisciplinatos and inquietos debent durius
arguere: obedientes autem ac patientes, ut in melius proficiant, obsecrare:
negligentes autem and contemnentes, debent utique increpare aut corripere: and
de criminalibus peccatis aut ultro confessos, aut ordine judiciario
comprobatos, atque convictos, secundum modum culpae, De Poenit. Medit. c. 3.
legaliter ac regulariter judicare. Noluit Apostolus, inquit beatus Augustinus,
hominem ab hoc homine judicari ex arbitrio suspicionis, vel etiam
extraordinario usurpato judicio: sed potius ex lege Dei, secundum ordinem
Ecclesiae, sive ultro confessum, sive accusatum atque convictum. Alioquin illud
cur dixit? Si quis cum frater nominatur, aut fornicator, aut idolis serviens,
etc. nisi quia eam nominationem intelligi voluit, quae sit in quenquam, 1 Cor.
6.
cum sententia ordine judiciario atque integritate profertur. Nam si nominatio
sufficit, multi damnandi sunt innocents: quia saepe falso in quenquam crimen
nominatur. Plerique antem boni Christiani propterea tacent, and sufferunt
aliorum peccata, quae noverunt, quia documentis saepe deferuntur, ut ea quae
sciunt, judicibus ecclesiastic is probare non possint. Quamvis enim vera sint
quaedam, non tamen judici facile credenda sunt, nisi certis indiciis
demonstrentur, nisi ordine judiciario comprobentur: ut si per judicium mali ab
Ecclesiae communione auferri non possunt, tolerentur potius, ne perverse malos
evitando, quisque ab Ecclesia ipse discedens, eos quos fugere videtur, vinciat
ad gehennam.

Quod scriptum est in eisdem ex nomine vestro literis, quia sane non patienter
Pontificii vestri monita, and correctiones, nos audisse comperistis, liquido
patet, adhuc perfectae aliquid charitatis minus duntaxat haberet, de qua dicit
Apostolus: Charitas patiens est, 1 Cor. 13.
benigna est, non inflatur, non irritatur, non agit perperam, omnia suffert,
omnia sustinet. Cujus charitatis modum and perfectionem in benignitate, ac
patientia, in humilitate, and sufferentia, exemplo sanctae paternitatis vestrae
in literis vestris discere admodum cuperemus, si Deus nos inde honorare
dignaretur.

Quod and in hoc possemus addiscere, si in his, quae ex nomine vestro nobis
scripta, sanctitati vestrae rescripsimus, sustineretis modicum quid
insipientiae nostrae, and supportaretis nos, 2 Cor. 1^.
sicut magnus Petrus, Apostolicae and primae Sedis primus Episcopus, non solum
patienter, sed and gaudenter adeo suscepit reprehensionem suam a coapostolo suo
Paulo sibi ostensam, Gal. 2.
ut ejus epistolas, in quibus se reprehensum legerat, cum maximo favore
laudaverit. 2 Pet. 3.
Non enim ita supputate eas laudare poterat, nisi legisset: and quia legit
scriptum, reprehensum se in eis invenit: and quoniam eas tam granditer
laudavit, quam gratanter justam reprehensionem suam accepto tulerit patienter,
ostendit; Et cum a minoribus suis reprehensus fuit, cur ad Gentiles intraverit,
non eis nudo and tumido sermon respondit, ut omnia quae egerat patientissime
sustinerent: nec aliquid in eorum querela de sua potestate dixit, sed humili
ejus ratione placavit, atque in causa reprehensionis suae etiam testes
adhibuit. Acts 11.
Quia si in querela fidelium, ut beatus dicit Gregorius, a^quid de sua
potestate diceret, profecto Doctor mansuetudinis non fuisset.

Si igitur pastor Ecclesiae Apostolorum princeps, signa and miracula
singulariter faciens, non dedignatus est, in causa reprehensionis suae,
rationem humiliter reddere: quanto magis, inquit Gregorius Apostolicae sedis
Pontifex, nos peccatores cum de re aliqua reprehendimur, nostros ratione humili
placare debemus? Literae autem ex nomine vestro nobis directae, non humili nos
ratione placarunt: nec contra rationem nos ex ratione and authoritate
quaesiisse monstrarunt: sed indebita increpatione os nostrum oppilare
studuerunt, quum Dei gratia, libera adhuc front de his, quae nobis per literas
ex nomine vestro directas impacta sunt, loqui possimus.

Scriptum est etiam in praefatis literis nobis ex nomine vestro directis de
Hincmaro hoc modo. Note the Insolent style of this Pope to this King.
Volumus, and auctoritate Apostolica jubemus, ipsum Hincmarum Laudunensem
Episcopum vestra fretum potentia, ad limina sanctorum, nostramque venire
clementiam. Quo sane veniente, veniat pariter accusator idoneus, quia nulla
possit auctoritate legitima respui: and tunc in praesentia nostra, and totius
sedis Romanae synodali collegio, causa illius prudenti ventilata examine, ac
diligenter inquisita, secundum Deum and sacrorum Canonum constitutiones spiritu
Dei prolatas, sine protelatione aliqua finietur.

Quae relegentes, licet contra morem decessorum ac praedecessorum vestrorum hoc
dictum invenerimus, Conc. (...). Can. 1.
id est, umbrosum saeculi typhum inducere in ecclesiam suam, quae lucem
simplicitatis and humilitatis diem Domini videre desiderantibus praefert; tamen
de voluntate non dubitavimus. Quia humano animo facile potest subripi, quod ex
deliberatione conveniat immutari. Sed valde mirati sumus, ubi hoc dictator
Epistolae nobis per Actardum Episcopum delatae scriptum invenetit? esse
Apostolica auctoritate praecipiendum, ut Rex corrector iniquorum, et districtor
reorum, ac secundum leges Ecclesiasticas atque mundanas ultor criminum, reum
legaliter and regulariter pro excessibus suis damnatum, sua fretum potentia,
Romam dirigat: maxim autem illum, qui and ante depositionem contra custodiam
publicam, and contra quietem moliri in tribus Synodis extitit deprehensus,
sicut in gestis Episcopalibus paternitati vestrae directis continetur, and post
depositionem suam, and per se, and per quoscunque potuit, a sua pervicacia non
quievit. Sed non miramur, si in posterioribus literis ex nomine vestro nobis
directis, est infulcitum, ut legaliter ac regulariter damnatus, qui nullis
legibus decernitur, a quoquam gradu seu rebus aut facultatibus redonandus,
antequam si contra custodiam and quietem publicam moliri non fuerit
deprehensus, renovato Apostolicae sedis auctoritate judicio in provincia, qua
fuerit judicatus, forte inveniatur innoxius, Regia nostra potentia ad vestram
veniat fretus, cum se authore damnato debeatur zelus rectitudinis, non
clementia resolutionis: quae si non de eodem foramine, de eodem tamen conamine
manarunt, de quo and anteriores fluxerunt, in quibus continetur, ut res omnes
Hincmaro commissae Ecclesiae, donec ad propria reverteretur, nobis
committeretis, ut indemnes consisterent, and aliquod dispendium non incurrerent.

Unde, sicut vobis rescripsimus, and nunc iterum vobis scribere non piguit, sed
exigente causa necessarium est: quia Reges Francorum ex Regio genere nati, non
Episcoporum vicedomini, sed terrae Domini hactenus fuimus computati: and ut Leo
ac Romana Synodus scripsit, Reges and Imperatores, quos terris divina potentia
praecepit praeesse, jus distinguendorum negotiorum Episcopis sanctis juxta
divalia constituta permiserunt; non autem Episcoporum villici extiterunt. Et
sanctus Augustinus dicit; Per jura regum possidentur possessiones: non autem
per Episcopale imperium Reges villici fiunt, actoresque Episcoporum. Et
Dominus, Mat. 22*
Quae sunt Caesaris, Caesari: and quae sunt Dei, Deo reddi praecipit; qui etiam
censum regi reddidit. Et Apostolus voluit serviri Regibus, voluit honorari, et
non conculcari Reges; Mat. 1^.
Regem, inquit, honorificate. Et iterum, Omnis, inquiens, anima potestatibus
sublimioribus subdita sit: 1 Pet. 2*
Reddite ergo omnibus debita. Et paulo superius: Ideo necessitate subditi
estote, Romans 13.
non solum propter iram, sed and propter conscientiam. Et si revolueritis
regesta decessorum ac praedecessorum vestrorum, talia mandata, sicut habentur
in literis ex nomine vestro nobis directis per Actardum Episcopum, decessores
nostros a decessoribus vestris accepisse nullatenus invenietis: Unde pauca de
pluribus vobis scribere necessarium duximus.

Sanctus Gregorius, merito vitae and sapientiae doctrina Apostolicae sedis
Pontifex, and toti orbi colendus, Francorum Regibus Theodorico and Theodeberto
praedecessoribus nostris, de praejudicio cujusdam Episcopi, non ita, ut vos
nobis scripsistis, pro eo, qui pro meritis suis ac regulariter just depositus
est, scripsit hoc modo. Frater and coepiscopus noster Ursinus Taurinae
Civitatis antistes, in parochiis suis, quae intra Regni vestri sunt terminos
constitutae, grave omnino dicitur praeju^icium sustinere: adeo ut contra
Ecclesiasticam observatiam, contraque Sacerdotalem gravitatem, and contra
sacrorum Canonum definita, nullo ejus exigente crimine, alter illis nunc
meruerit ordinari. Et quia parum visum est, si in licitis non jungerentur
illicita, etiam res Ecclesiae suae (ut fertur) ablatae sunt. Quod si ita se
veritas habet, quoniam nimis intolerabile est, ut virtute opprimeretur, cui
culpa non nocuit, praemisso paternae salutationis alloquio, petimus, ut quod
excellentia vestra amore Ecclesiasticae reverentiae, and aequitatis
contemplatione, sponte potest impendere, nostrae studeat benignius
intercessioni concedere: and justitiam illi, sicut de aequitatis ejus bona
confidimus, faciat in omnibus custodiri, atque patefacta veritate, quod
illicite actum est corrigi. Pro utilitate ergo animae vestrae haec apud vos
nostra exhortatic locum inveniat, etc.

Sed and ad Romanum Exarchum, minoris dignitatis, quam simus Dei gratia Regiae
potestatis, de quodam Episcopo scripsit hoc modo. Pervenit ad nos, Blandum
Ortonesis civitatis Episcopum, longo jam tempore, in civitate Ravennatia vestra
excellentia detineri, and fit ut Ecclesia sine rectore, and populus quasi sine
pastore grex fuit: and ibidem infante^ pro p^ccatis absque baptismate
moriantur. Et rursus. Quia non credimus, quod cum excellentia vestra, nisi ex
aliqua probabilis excessus causa tenuerit, oportet, ut habita Synodo, palam
fiat, si quod in eum crimen intenditur, and si talis in eo culpa reperiatur,
quae ad usque degradationem Sacerdotii deducatur; aliam ordinationem necesse
est inquiramus, ne Ecclesia Dei in his, sine quibus eam Christiana non patitur
esse Religio, inculta ac destituta maneat. Sin autem excellentia vestra aliter
se habere, quam de eo quod dicitur esse, perspexerit, eum ad Ecclesiam suam
reverti concedat, ut officium suum in commissis sibi animabus adimpleat. Quibus
mandatis B. Gregorii praedecessoris vestri de his, qui nec dum judicio Synodali
legaliter ac regulariter pro criminibus suis fuere depositi, collatis cum
scriptis ex nomine vestro ac nobis directis, ex eo qui legaliter ac regulariter
pro suis excessibus judicio Synodali habetur depositus, ut eum nostra fretum
potentia Romam mittamus, quae potius sequenda sint, judicate. Nos autem
authoritatem vestram judicaturam potius credimus, ut ea sequamur, quae
decessores ac praedecessores vestri secundum Scripturarum tramitem,
praedicationemque majorum scripserunt, quam illa, quae scriptor saepe dictae
Epistolae ex nomine vestro nobis directae confinxit.

Ait enim beatus Augustinus libro ad Jannuarium, Omnia talia, quae neque
sanctarum Scripturarum auctoritatibus continentur, nec Conciliis Episcoporum
statuta inveniuntur, nec consuetudine universalis Ecclesiae roborata sunt,
resecanda existimo. Et S. Leo, de his quae a sacris Canonibus habentur ita
praefixa, and eisdem Apostolicae sedis sunt promulgata decr^is, ut nullapossint
ratione convelli, constituit; Ut omni penitus autoritate fit vacuum, quicquid
ab illorum fuerit constitutione diversum. Ac si cum Paulo diceret; Quia sibi
ipsi Apostolica seeds in suis constitutionibus esse non potest contraria;
Galat. 1.
Licet nos, aut Angelus de coelo Evangelizet vobis p^aeter quod Evangelizavimus
vobis, anathema sit. Sed ut in controversia Quintiliani legitur, Floribus
vafricia nebulonum veneficatis apes mortuas esse, quibus mellificandum fuerat;
De Scripturis sacris B. Petrus agi demonstrat, 2 Pet. 3.
loquens de Pauli Epistolis, Quae indocti and instabiles, inquit, depravant,
sicut and caeteras Scripturas ad suam ipsorum perditionem: Et de traditionibus
Ecclesiasticis S. Innocentius, Ad Decentium Episcopum Eugub.
Dum, inquiens, unusquisque non quod traditum est, sed quod sibi visum fuerit,
hoc existimat esse tenendum, inde diversa in diversis locis aut Ecclesiis, aut
teneri, aut celebrari videntur, ac fit scandalum populis, qui, dum nesciunt
traditiones antiquas humana praesumptione corruptas, putant sibi aut Ecclesiis
non convenire, aut ab Apostolis vel Apostolicis viris contrarietatem inductam.
Contra quem morbum S. Caelestinus salubre cunctis celebravit antidotum, dicens:
Nulli Sacerdoti suos liceat Canones ignorare, Epist. 2.
nec quicquam facere quod Patrum regulis possit obviare. Quae enim a nobis res
digna servabitur, si decretalium norma constitutorum, pro aliquorum libitu
licentia populis permissa frangatur? Et sanctus Gelasius in decretis suis:
Patres nostri, Catholici videlicet and docti Pontifices, in unaquaque secta,
quolibet tempore suscitata, quicquid pro fide, pro veritate, pro communione
Catholica atque Apostolica, secundum Scripturarum tramitem, praedicationemque
majorum, facta semel congregatione sanxerunt, inconvulsum voluerunt deinceps
firmumque constare: nec in eadem causa denuo quae praefixa fuerant retractari,
qualibet recenti praesumptione permiserunt.

Videndum est igitur, quid hic trames sanctarum scripturarum, and praedicatio
majorum definiant. Scriptum quippe legimus in sacra historia dixisse Dominum
per Prophetam Josaphat Regi, 2 Paral. 19.
Impio praebes auxilium, and his qui ^derunt Dominum amicitia jungeris: and
idcirco iram quidem Domini merebaris, sed bona opera inventa suns in te, eo
quod abstuleris lucos de terra Juda. Matthew. 18.
Et in Evangelio semel and ^ecundo ac tertio monitum, and non obedientem ad
correctionem debitam, Dominus sicut Ethnicum and publicanum jubet haberi.

Et beatus Gregorius in decretis suis, sicut in gestis Synodi invenire
potestis, pervasorem non solum rerum alienarum, sed etiam Ecclesiae sibi
commissae anathematizatum definit: verum etsi alius hoc egerit, is qui praeest
Ecclesiae, si hoc vel ipse fieri praecipit, vel sine sua praeceptione factum
digna punire animadversione neglexerit, Deuteronomy. 17.
eum anathematizat: satis ergo mirari non possumus, unde scriptor Epistolae,
nobis ex nomine vestro delatae, Gal. 3.
hanc legem apud se auro sculptam produxit, quam Dominus digito suo non
scripsit; nec scribendam cuiquam inspiravit, neque ordinatam per Angelos in
manu Mediatoris illius dedit: quam non paganus indixit, non Christianus
induxit, non Ecclesiasticus vir decrevit, quae de se sub isto coelo sicut non
attramento manu justitiae, ita nec Spiritu Dei vivi scripta personuit: qua me
Regem a Deo constitutum, et gladio ex utraque part acuto: ultore scilicet
nocentium and defensore innocentium in^ignitum, Romans 23.
ad vindictam malefactorum, ut exponit Apostolus, laudem vero bonorum, rei
atque damnati, atque anathematizari fautorem esse praecipit, jubemus ut
Hincmarum sacrarum legum praevaricatorem, sancti Sacerdotii vituperatorem,
Regiae dignitatis contra regulam Apostolicam dehortatorem, regni perturbatorem,
perjurum, and seditionum authorem, Ecclesiae sibi commissae afflictorem,
facultatum Ecclesiasticarum sacrilegum, fraudatorem, ac extirpatorem
Episcoporum, ac totius populi nostrarum partium scandalizatorem, alienarum
rerum pervasorem, and veniendo contra subscriptiones and professiones suas a
scipso damnatum, potentia Regia frerum, Romam venire fac^amus.

Quis igitur hanc universam legem infernus evomuit? Quis tartarus de suis
abditis and tenebrosis cumculis eructavit? Contra quam literis sacris ostensa
nobis est via, 3 Reg. 2.
quam sequamur, apposita forma, cui impriimmur. Clamavit, inquit, Propheta ad
Regem Israel, and ait: Servus tuus egressus est ad prae^^andum cominus: cumque
fugisset vir unus, adduxit eum quidam ad me, and dixit: Custodi virum istum,
qui fuerit lapsus, erit anima tua pro anima ejus, aut talentum argenti
appendes. Dum autem ego turbatus huc illucque me v^rterem, subito non
comparuit. Et ait Rex Israel ad eum, Hoc est judicium tuum, quod ipse
decrevisti. At ille statimabstersit pulverem de facie sua, and cognovit eum Rex
Israel, quod esset de Prophetis. Qui ait ad eum, Haec dicit tibi Dominus; Quia
dimisisti virum dignum morte (...) manu tua, erit anima tua pro anima ejus, and
populus tuus pro populo ejus. Reversus est igitur Rex Israel in domum suam
audire contemnens, and furibundus venit in Samariam. Quaenam vos dementia
coepit scientes dixisse Christum Dei virtutem and Dei sapientiam? Prove. ^.
Per me Reges regnant, and conditores legum justa decernunt. Et sacri Canones
(sicut credimus, and in Apostolicis literis saepius regimus) Spiritu Dei
conditi, and totius mundi reverentia sunt consecrati; propterea videamus, quid
de hujusmodi sancti Canones and sacrae leges decernant: Ait enim S. Africanum
Concilium, Can. 29:
Et illud petendum (quin apud terrae Principes) statuere dignentur, ut si quis
cujus^ibet honoris cl^ricus judicio Episcoporum quocumque crimine fuerit
damnatus, non liceat eum sive ab Ecclesiis quibus praefuit; sive a quolibet
homine defensari, interposita poena damni, pecuniae atque honoris, quo nec
aetatem, nec sexum excusandum esse praecipiant.

Et tunc Valens, Gratianus and Valentinianus constituerunt, Vt quicunque
residentibus Sacerdotibus fuerit Episcopali loco detrusus, and nomine; si
aliquid contra custodiam publicam, vel contra quietem moliri fuerit
deprehensus; rursumque Sacerdotium petere, a quo videtur expulsus, procul ab
urbe quam infecit, secundum legem divae memoriae Gratiani, centum millibus
vitam agat, sit ab eorum caetibus separatus, a quorum est societate discretus;
Sique hujusmodi personis illicatum, hujus legis tenore, sacra nostra adire
secreta, and imperare scripta, omnibus abiectis per culpam Sacerdotio personis,
quae impretata sunt infecta permoveant, scituris his, quorum defensione
nituntur, absque sui praehensione non futurum, si hoc eis pollicetur
suffragium, qui divinum no^ videntur mer^^ie judicium. Unde and Leo Papa apud
principalem potestatem petiit de Eutiche scandali and pravitatis authore, Ut ab
eo loco, qui Constantinopolitanae urbi nimis vicinus erat, longius
transferretur, ne frequentioribus solatiis eorum, quos ad impietatem suam
traxit, uteretur.

Et Gregorius Paulum Diadinae civitatis quondam Episcopum, quousque omne, quod
dilapidavit, vel de substantia tulit Ecclesiae, restitueret, in monasterium
mirtendum esse decrevit. Et si sort post depositionem suam inverecunde ac
mente perversa aliquando de Episcopatu loqui, aut rursus ad hoc qualibet
aspirare praesumptione tentaverit, Dominici corporis and sanguinis communione
privatum, in monasterio eum usque ad diem obitus sui, ad agendam poenitentiam
retrudi, studio Joannis Primae Justinianae Episcopi jussit, ut perpetrati
sceleris maculas dignus disceret fletibus emendare, juxta legem Justiniani
imper. qui in libro Constitutionum decrevit. Ut si quis Episcopus explosus,
ausus fuerit ingredi civitatem, d^ qua repulsus est, vel exire de loco, in quo
degere iussus est, jubemus eum in monasterio, in alia Provincia constituto
tradi, ut quae in Sacerdotio peccavit, degens in monasterio corrigat. Quas
leges ab Imp. et Regibus nostris yidelicet praedecessoribus, promulgatas atque
decretas, nos immutilate et irrefragabiliter convenit conservare, sicut
Apostolicae sedis Antistites ad Dominos and terrae Principes scripserunt: Ait
enim Leo ad Leonem Augustum, Debes, inquiens, incunctanter advertere Regiam
potestatem tibi non ad solum mundi regimen, sed maxim ad Ecclesiae praesidium
esse collatam, ut ausus nefarios comprimendo, quae been sunt statuta, defendas,
and veram pacem his, quae sunt turbata, restituas.

Et Gelasius ad Anastasium: Etenim Imperator Auguste, si contra leges publicas
aliquid (quod absit) quispiam fortasse tentaret, nulla id ratione potuisset
admitti. Quas etiam leges principales authoritate promulgatas, non solum
quibuscumque Episcopis, sed etiam ab ipsis Apostolicae sedis Pontificibus,
ipsius primae sedis Antistites observari debere scripserunt, sicut beatus Leo
ad Leonem Augustum scribe^s demonstrat, dicens, Non se refragari debere edicta
Imperialia, vel ea quae sui decessores secundum tramitem scripturarum
praedicationemque majorum statuerant. Si quae, inquiens, destruxi, ego
aedifico, praevaricatorem me constituo, and eis me ultionum conditionibus
subdo, quas non solum auctoritas beatae memoriae Principis Martiani, sed etiam
ego mea consensione firmavi.

Et S. Gelasius ad Anastasium Imperatorem, Epi^^. 10
Si, inquit, quantum ad ordinem publicae pertinet disciplinae, cognoscentes
imperium tibi superna dispositione collatum, legibus tuis ipsi quoque parent
roligionis Antistites, ne vel in rebus mundanis excluso, videantur obviare
sententiae: Quo, oro te, affectu eis convenit obedire, qui pro erogandis
venerabilibus sunt attributi mysteriis. Quod and nos juxta hortamentum beati
Gelasii incunctanter atque libenter exequi cupimus in his, quae ad suum
ministerium pertinent, cunctis generaliter Sacerdotibus recte divina
tractantibus, and potissime sedis illius Praesulis, quem cunctis Sacerdotibus
divinitas summa voluit praeeminere, de Anath. vinc.
and subsequens Ecclesiae jugiter pietas celebravit: sicut nostri decessores ac
progenitores orthodoxi Imperatores, and Reges egerunt, ut and Apostolicae sedis
Pontifex, and reliqui Domini Sacerdotes nobis, quae a Deo sunt consecuta,
exhibeant: Scientes sicut idem B. Gelasius dicit, Quoniam Christus memor
fragilitatis humanae, quod suorum saluti congrueret, dispensatione magnifica
temperavit, sic actionibus propriis, dignitatibusque distinctis officia
potestatis utriusque discrevit, suosque volens medicinali humilitate salvari,
non humana superbia rursus intercipi, ut and Christiani Principes pro aeterna
vita Pontificibus indigerent, and Pontifices pro temporalium cursu rerum
Imperialibus dispositionibus uterentur: quatenus spiritualis actio a carnalibus
distaret incursibus: and ideo militans Deo minime se negotiis saecularibus
implicaret, ac vicissim non ille rebus divinis praesidere videretur, qui esset
negotiis saecularibus implicatus, 2 Timothy 2.
ut and modestia utriusque ordinis curaretur, nec extolleretur utroque
suffultus, and competens qualitatibus actionum specialiter professio aptaretur.
Omnis Pontifex, inquit Apostolus, ex hominibus assumptus, pro hominibus
constituitur in his quae sunt ad Deum, Heb. 5.
ut offerat dona and sacrificia pro peccatis, videlicet non solum pro populi,
sed quia and ipse circundatus est infirmitate, pro suis. Et Regis est regni
negotia dispensare, sicut inculcant literae divinitus inspiratae. Quia ergo
sanctarum Scripturarum tramite, and praedicatione majorum ostenditur sancto
etiam attestante Galesio, Epist. 10.
Quia duo sunt, quibus principaliter mundus hic regitur, auctoritas sacra
Pontificum, and Regalis potestas. Et per Regem Regum, ac summum Pontificem
cunctorum Pontificum, Prove. 8.
qui solus Rex and Sacerdos fieri potuit, Conditores legum justa decernunt:
Quas leges Principales potestates appellaverunt aeternas, and sacri Canones
Spiritu Dei sunt conditi, and totius mundi reverentia consectati, and ut beatus
Ambrosius ad Valentinianum dicit, Legis Imperator fert, quas primus ipse
custodiat, quia quod praescripsit aliis, praescripsit sibi, ne cui esset
liberum aliud judicare. Et beatus Augustinus dicit, Quia postquam leges
subscriptae fuerint and firmatae, non licet judici de ipsis judicare, sed
secundum ipsas: Quia secundum Pontificale Ministerium vestrum, regio ministerio
nostro monita vestrae paternitatis obedienter ac libenter cupimus obaudire:
patimini nos ea servare, quae praedecessores vestri ac nostri de hujusmodi,
unde agitur, constituerunt, and roborantes servando, quae gesta sunt, rata
doceamus esse debere, quae gerimus. Nam quomodo leges Principum rite vocabuntur
aeternae, si transeuntibus principibus, una cum eis constitutio legis
transibit? Et Papa Symmachus ad Eonium; Dum, inquit, ad Trinitatis instar, cui
una est atque individua potestas unum, sit per diversos Antistites Sacerdotium,
quomodo priorum statuta a sequentibus convenit violari? Huc accedit, quod
sibaec eveniat sententiarum varietas ad ipsam sacrosanctam religionem credimus
pertinere, cujus omnis potestas infringitur, nisi universa, quae a Domini
Sacerdotibus semel statuuntur perpetua sint. Quod alias contingere poterit, si
successor decessoris actibus non tribuerit firmitatem, and roborando quae gesta
sunt, faciat rata esse quae gesserit? Quanta enim Vicariis B. Petri Apostoli
judicabitur esse reverentia, si quae in Sacerdotio praecipiunt, eisdem
transeuntibus dissolvantur. Vniversa, inquit, perpetua sint, quae a Domini
Sacerdotibus statuuntur, qui ut Moses, ea quae statuunt ab oraculo divino
suscipiunt: non quae ab his statuuntur, de quibus per Prophetam dicitur: Vae
his qui condunt leges iniquas, and scribentes injustitiam scripserunt. Et
nihilominus, quae a Vicariis B. Petri costituuntur maneant inconvuls^. Esa. 1^
Quia ut Leo dicit, nec nimia est severitas vel remissio, ubi nihil
constituitur, nisi quod ex beati Petri aequitate profertur.

Haec enim scimus esse Canonica, Sermon. 3. ^n ann^v.
scimus esse Apostolica auctoritate robrata, and Apostolicae sedis decreta,
quae, ut Gelasius dicit, unamquamque Synodum and sua auctoritate confirmat, and
continua modo ratione custodit, pro suo scilicet principatu, quem B. Petrus
Apostolus Domini voce, Ep. ad Darda^.
praeceptum, Ecclesia nihilominus subsequente, and tenuit semper and retinet.
Et paulo superius. Confidimus quod nullus jam veraciter Christianus ignorant,
uniuscu^usque Synodi constitutum, Epist. 6.
quod universalis Ecclesiae probavit assensus, nullum magis exequi sedem prae
caeteris oportere, quam primam. Et item idem. Cumque nobis contra salutarium
reverentiam regularum cupiamus temere licere, and cum seeds Apostolica super
his omnibus favente Domino, quae paternis Canonibus sunt praefixa, pio
devotoque studeat tenere proposito, satis indignum est, quenquam, vel
Pontificum, vel ordinum subsequentium, hanc observantiam refutare, quam B.
Petri sedem and sequi videat and docere: Satisque conveniens sit, ut totum
corpus Ecclesiae in hac sibimet observatione concordet, quam illic videre
conspiciat, ubi Dominus Ecclesiae totius posuit principatum. Et de sacris
legibus, Epist. 10.
quas una cum Sanctis Canonibus Catholica observat Ecclesia, idem Gelasius, ut
praemisimus, dicit in Epistola ad Anastasium Imperatorem, Quantum, inquiens, ad
ordinem publicae pertinet disciplinae, cognoscentes imperum tibi superna
dispositione collatum, legibus tuis ipsi quoque parent Religionis Antistites,
ne vel in rebus mundanis exclusae videantur obviare sententiae.

Et cum ita sacrae leges, tam Ecclesiasticae quam mundanae, de damnato
Episcopali and Synodali Concilio decernant, non est nostri Regii ministerii,
reum and sacrorum Canonum judicio condemnatum, atque Apostolicae sedis
definitione, sicut in gestis Synodi invenire potestis, anathematizatum, nostra
potentia fretum quoquam dirigere: cum apertissime sacri Canones definiant, and
leges Justiniani ac caeterorum Imperatorum Catholicorum edicta qualiter, and
pro quibus and a quibus debeat Episcopus judicari; and post judicium, quid and
qualiter, and per quos sit inde Apostolicae sedis agendum: quae non abnuimus,
sed incunctanter and competenter annuimus.

A quibus definitionibus nulli est licitum deviare: quia, ut S Hilarus Papa
dicit, Non minus in Sanctarum traditionum delinquitur sanctiones, quam in
injuriam ipsius Domini prosilitur.

Quocirca, Malach. ^.
quia Dominus dicit per Prophetam, Labia Sacerdotis custodient scientiam, and
legem requirent ex ore ejus, quia Angelus, id est, nuncius Domini exercituum
est; Nolite permittere nobis scribi ex vestrae authoritatis nomine, quae in
legibus sacris, Dei sapientia conditis, and in sanctis regulis Spiritu
promulgatis, non continentur, Ezech. ^.
dicente item Propheta, id est, Sacerdoti praecipiente, Audiens nunciabis eis
ex me, ex me inquit, Joan. 7.
and non ex te, Et redarguuntur, qui de cord suo loquuntur. Quoniam, qui a
semetipso loquitur, gloriam proprium quaerit:

Nolite igitur, ^t praemisimus, ex vestro nomine, vel Apostolicae sedis
authoritate, visiones vel excommunicationum intentationes contra sacrarum
scripturarum tramitem, praedicationemque majorum ac sacrarum legum,
sanctorumque Canonum constitutiones nobis de caetero scribi cuiuscunque
instinctu permittere precamur.

Quia scitis, Sermon. 3. in ann^v.
and scimus, totum esse irritum, quicquid ab eorum fuerit constitutione
diversum. Dicitur, inquit S. Leo, a Domino beatissimo Petro, Tibi dabo claves
regni coelorum, Matthew. 1^.
and quemcunque solveris super terram, erunt soluta and in coelis. Transivit
quidem etiam in alios Apostolos jus istius potestatis, and ad omnes Ecclesiae
principes decreti hujus constitutio commeavit: sed non frustrauni commendatur,
quod omnibus intimatur. Petro enim ideo hoc singulariter creditur, quia cunctis
Ecclesiae rectoribus Petri forma praeponitur. Manet ergo Petri privilegium, ubi
ex ipsius aequitate fertur ^udicium: Qua sententia constat, quia non manet
Petri privilegium, ubi ex ipsius a quitate non fertur judicium. Cum enim
ubicunque dicitur, sicuti nullus locus, ita nemo rector Ecclesiae, ex Petri
aequitate judicium. Cum enim ubicunque dicitur, sicuti nullus locus, ita nemo
rector Ecclesiae ex Petri aequitate judicum ferens excipitur, vel contra illius
aequitatem judicium proferens commendatur. Et quia ubicunque sine ulla
exceptione non manet Petri privilegium, ubi ex ipsius aequitate non fertur
judicium, prolatum obaudiemus jussum, vel recipiemus judicium, quod non ex
Petri aequitate fuerit prolatum ac per hoc ipsius privilegio fuerit destitutum?
De quo Episcopali judicio, quid cunctis Episcopis sequendum, and quid Ecclesiae
filiis sit tenendum atque servandum, B. Gregorius sufficienter inculcat.

Ergo jubete and judicate privilegio magni Petri juxta aequitatis ejus
judicium, quae jubenda and judicanda sunt. Ne, ut dicit ejus Coapostolus,
vituperetur ministerium vestrum. 2 Cor. 6.
Quia and nos secundum regium ministerium nostrum, quantum ex nobis est cupimus
servare quod scriptum est, Ephesians. 6.
Filii, obedite parentibus vestris in Domino, videlicet, quod fuerit jussum,
Psalm. 44.
vel indicatum a Domino: dicente illo singulis, quia pro patribus, Apostolis
Ecclesiae, Ezech. 3.
nati sunt filii, Apostolici viri: Tu autem audiens nunciabis eis ex me. Number.
22.
Divina quippe nos lectio docet, quia nec etiam Balaam satis superque a Rege
Balac petitus, licet medicamento avaritiae delinitus in concilio dando
corruptus ostenderit, ullo tamen aut ullius instinctu in judicio justitiae
aliud loqui adversus Israel persuaderi vel extorqueri potuit, quam quod a
Domino audivit.

De eo, quod in literis ex nomine vestro nobis directis habetur, Ut veniente
Hincmaro Romam, veniat accusator idoneus, qui nulla possit auctoritate legitima
respui: rescribimus: Quia licet haec commendatio nulla sit ratione atque
auctoritate suffulta, si forte apud vos exlex solus Hincmarus nova lege priscis
tam publicis, quam Ecclesiasticis contraria, imo ordine novoque more habetur,
ut non nisi a vobis et Romae valeat judicari pro his excessibus, de quibus
habentur certa sacrorum Canonum ac legum decreta: Quae, ut Leo dicit, nulla
possunt ratione convelli, cum etiam de causa fidei, ut dicit Gelasius,
cuicumque Pontifici licet secundum regulam erroris ante damnati, quemlibet a
Catholica communione discernere; Et ego ita exors ab omnibus accusationibus,
non solum ab his quibus legaliter and regulariter accusandi adversus seipsum
denegatur licentia, verum and ab his quibus in propriis causis accusatio non
negatur: ut sicut leges and regulae jubent, in Provincia, in qua sunt orta
negotia, terminari non valiant, and secundum Antiochenos Canones, Provincialium
Synodorum non debeant experiri examen. Si vobis vias cum voluntate and consensu
dilectissimi nepotis nostri Imperatoris vestri, contra cujus dilectionem and
debitum honorem vobis exhibere studuerit, illuc ire non volumus, obtinueritis,
cooperante Domino, pace in regno nostro contra Paganos virtute vel quacunque
dispositione Dei obtenta, Romam venire congruo tempore non differemus. Et quia
illum legaliter aut regulariter in Synodo Episcoporum, plurimarum Provinciarum
de certis causis accusavimus, idoneum nos accusatorem illius ostendemus: and
tantos testes idoneos diversi ordinis ac dignitatis nobiscum ducemus, cum
quibus eum legaliter ac regulariter nos accusasse, and comprobasse,
sufficientissime comprobabimus. Tandem, quia vos non legisse, vel audisse
collegimus ex literis ab Actardo Episcopo nobis delatis, quae antea per illum
paternitati vestrae direximus, iterato scribimus ea, quae tunc scripseramus,
deprecantes vos in omnipotentis Dei honor, and Sanctorum Apostolorum
veneratione, ut tales inhonorationis nostrae Epistolas, taliaque mandata, sicut
hactenus ex nomine vestro suscepimus, nobis, et regni nostri Episcopis ac
Primoribus de caetero non mandetis, et non compellatis nos mandata, et
Epistolas vestras inhonorandas contemnere, et missos vestros dehonorare, qui,
vobis, in his, quae ad vestrum ministerium pertinent, si tamen ministerium
vestrum, cupimus obtemperare. Quae pro vestri honor privilegii vobis dicimus,
quia vobis, sicut revera Vicario B. Petri Apostolorum Principis, in omnibus
debite ac competenter obedire desideramus, and ne aliter eveniat cavere per
omnia cupimus, ac vestram sanctitatem id ipsum cavere humili prece deposcimus:
ne nos and nostros satis invitos ad id cogatis convertere quod in quinta
Universali Synodo, a sede Apostolica ut in Apostolicis literis, praecipue autem
in Synodica B. Gregorii ad quatuor Patriarchas, and in aliis ejus Epistolis,
una cum quatuor praecedentibus legimus collandatum atque susceptum invenitur,
nobis tenendum. Quod adhuc nostris literis ad exemplum inserere no luimus donec
sciamus, si duritiam mandatorum vestrorum erga nos aliter ad benignitatem
inflectere poterimus. Quia quod ex Apostolicae sedis nomine secundum sanctarum
Scripturarum tramitem, praedicationemque majorum and orthodoxorum decreta
scribuntur, sequendum and tenendum non ignoravimus; et quod secus a quoquam
fuerit compilatum sive confictum, non solum respuendum, sed et redarguendum
esse cognoscimus. Si denique aliter quam nos and vos decuerat, reverendistimae
paternitati vestrae rescribendo, factus sum insipiens, vos me coegistis.
Petimus autem omnipotentem Dominum ut inspiret cordi vestro sic nos benign
tractare, quatenus ulterius nobis non sit necesse vobis ita rescribere. Sed ut
cupimus in veneratione Apostolorum Apostolico Pontificio vestro humiliter ac
devote colla and corda submittere. Deus omnipotens ad honorem and salutationem,
atque exaltationem sanctae suae Ecclesiae, vos per multa annorum curricula
conservare dignetur, Domine sanctissime and reverendissime pater in Domino.

Hincmarus Archbishop of Rhemes with his Suffragans, Anno 846.
and four other Archbishops of France with their Suffragans, by command of this
King Charles, in their respective Synods, compiled several Canons and
Ecclesiastical decrees, which they presented to the King and his Nobles, to
confirm and ratify; Upon perusal, they finding some of them entrenching upon
the Kings prerogative; the Privileges of the Nobles, and peoples Liberties,
and giving overmuch power to the Bishops by enlarging their Ecclesiastical
Jurisdictions, the Nobles would by no means assent unto them, but only selected
21. out of 88. of their Canons, Codex Legur^ Antiquarum, p. 1196, 1197, etc.
rejecting all the rest, which 21. were confirmed by King Charles, and
published in his Name with this Title; [a] Karoli Hludovici Imp. F. Capitula,
printed in [b] Fredericus Lindebregus, with this preface to them. Haec quae
sequuntur Capitula excerpta sunt a Domino Rege Carolo, Domini Hludovici Imp.
Filio, and Principibus ejus, ex Capitulis quae anno DCCCXLVI. ediderant See
Surius Council. Tom. 3. p. 454, etc.
Episcopi in Synodis, Wenilo scilicet cum Suffraganeis suis; Guntboldus cum
Suffraganeis suis; Ursmarus cum Suffraganeis suis; Hincmarus cum Suffraganeis
suis; Amalo cum Suffraganeis suis: et oblata sunt (some time after) eidem
Principi, sicut ipse jusserat, collecta ad relegendum, in Sparnaco Villa
Remensis Ecclesiae. Et quia, factione qudrundam, motus est animus ipsius Regis
contra Episcopos, dissidentibus regni sui Primoribus ab eorundem Episcoporum
admonitione, et remotis ab eodem Concilio Episcopis, ex omnibus illis
Capitulis, Haec tantum observanda et complacenda sibi collegerunt, et Episcopis
scripto tradiderunt; dicentes, Non amplius de eorum Capitulis acceptasse, quam
ista, et ista se velle cum Principe observare. A memorable clear Evidence, 1.
That no Ecclesiastical Canons and Constitutions made by Archbishops and Bishops
in their Synods, were obligatory, or valid, unless first examined, approved by
Kings and their Nobles, to whom they were usually presented for their
examination, and ratified, if approved by them. 2ly. That the Nobles, as well
as Kings and Emperors, had a negative voice in Councils and Synods, to reject
Canons or Constitutions when made and drawn up in them by the Bishops. 3ly.
That they rejected such of them as they deemed prejudicial to the Crown, their
own or the peoples Privileges, or enlarged the Bishops Ecclesiastical
Authority beyond its due ancient limits, which the Bishops were over prone to
amplify in most of their Synods, as well as Popes; that so they might tyrannize
over Kings, Nobles, and Laymen at their pleasures.

Anno 876. there was a General Synod (as the Romanists style it) assembled at
Constantinopl, Anno 876
consisting of 373. Bishops; Surius Council. Tom. 3. p. 530, 531, 539. Cent.
Magd. 9. c. 9. col. 426, 427, 559, 560. Money Mysterium Iniquitatis, p. 180,
181, 152.
wherein these particulars are observable; 1. That it was summoned by the
Emperor Basilius his industry, about the restitution of Ignatius to the Sea of
Constantinople, of which he was deprived by Michael the Emperor, and to remove
Photius, intruded into it in his room. 2ly. That Pope Adrian the 2d. writ to
this Emperor, importuning him to summon this Council. 3dly. That this Pope sent
his Legates to it. 4ly. That this Emperor Basilius, though he advanced the
Popes Supremacy over the Greek Church in a great measure in this Council, yet
in exordio Synodi ita locutus est; Cum divina et benignissima providentia NOBIS
GUBERNACULA UNIVERSALIS NAVIS (Ecclesiae) COMMISISSET, (not to the Pope, or
Patriarch of Constantinople, the two competitors for this trust) omne studium
arripu^^us, et ante publicas curas Ecclesiasticas, Ecclesiasticas dissolvere et
procellas, quae per multos annos ex invidia odientis bonum Satanae expansae
sunt, in stabilem tranquilitatem per meliorem quandam provisionem transfer,
etc. Igitur iis quae prava vobis omnibus esse videbantur et aspera, in vias
planas imperatoria diligentiaet studio nostro translatis, commonemus et
hortamur omnes vos fratres, ut cum multo pondere et reverentia conveniatis ad
sanctam hanc et universalem Synodum, tanquam ad communem et universis aptam,
atque sine labor medelam, nullam vitiosam motionem, vel affectum ferentes, nec
ad contentiosam voluntatem respicientes, sed potius vinci been, quam vincere
periculose ac injuste sitientes. Sic enim unusquisque qui vitiatum interiorem
patitur hominem, sanitatem recipiet, et aeternam salutem percipiet, etc. 5ly.
That Photius the Patriarchand his followers summoned to and entering into this
Synod, Surius, Tom. 3. p. 531, 539, 540, 54^, 542 Cent. Magd. 9. col. 353, 354,
487, 488. Zonara^ Annal. Tom. 3.
Actio 4. and 5. would give no answer at all to the Questions demanded of them
by the Popes Legates, nor acknowledge their authority: whereupon the Legates
spoke thus to the Princes, Principibus, qui jussu Basi^i Imperatoris
interfuerunt Interrogate illos magni, fortissimi, and gloriosissimi Principes,
an illi qui introterunt, faciunt libellum hoc? That Actio 7. Bahanis Patricius,
et Praepositus, dixit ad Synodum, Photio praesente, cum Episcopis suis, Sanctus
Imperator noster vult facere also cutionem ad istos per me indignum servum
suum. Whereupon Sanctissimi Vicarii senioris Romae ^^ixerunt; Sicut jubet
Imperium ejus. Bahanis dixit, Hortatorie alloquitur vos Imperator; Homines,
(...), estis? etc. Episcopi Photii dixerunt; Deus custodiat Imperatorem
nostrum, Verbum petivimus impunitatis, ut diceremus negocia nostra cum fiducia,
and non accepimus, (according to the Emperors promise) quantum ergo habemus
loqui, etc. After many discourses between Bahanis and them, Bahanis dixit; Per
Imperatorem nostrum sanctum nihil prohibemini, jubet enim, vult et acquiescit
ut loquamini: Sed viaentes Judices convicia vestra (Judices dicit Vicarios
Papae and Patriarcham, as Binius informs us in his Marginal Note) Episcopi
Photii dixerunt; et nos Iudices ipsos non recipimus. After many more
discourses, answers and replies between them and Bahanis, speaking in the name
and by the command of the Emperor, Photius and his Bishops would by no means
submit to the Judgment of the Pope and Patriarch, or their Delegates, as unfit
and partial Judges in this case. 6ly. That Justinian was in truth President and
chief Judge in this Synod, not the Popes Legates; as is evident 1. By his
Oration in the beginning of this Synod, Action 1. 2ly. By his elegant Oration
to Photius, and his Bishops, Surius Tom. 3. p. 538, to ^44.
and the whole Synod, exhorting them all to Peace, unity, humility and
reconciliation, Action 2. and 5. with his Oration to them at the cioze of this
Synod, and his and Bahanis Interlocutory Speeches therein recorded, worthy
reading, overlong to insert. 3ly. By giving Photius and his Bps. 7. days
respite to consider whether they would submit and comply, or not, Action 6.
4ly. By these his memorable Questions propounded to the Synod and others when
they had finished their Canons and Sentences. Quisquis habet aliquid adversus
hanc Sanctam et Vniversalem Synodum dicendum, aut contra hujus Canones aut
terminum, stet in medio, et quae sibi videntur edicat, sive Episcopus sit, sive
quisquam de Ecclesiastio Clero, sive Laicus, aut ex iis qui civilibus officiis
mancipantur, existat: Licentiam damus omnibus, ut qui in mente habet quid
ambiguum de iis, quae decreta sunt in hac sancta Synodo, hoc in medium
exhibeat, et suscipiat satisfactione salubre remedium, etc. Qui ergo habet quid
dicendum, dicat dum haec celebratur: Nam soluta sancta and universali Synodo,
qui apparuerit Ecclesiae Dei contradicens, aut non communicans ei, sive
Episcopus sit, sive absolute Sacerdos, sive dignitate aliqua praeditus, vel
aliqua conversatus, veniam ab Imperio nostro minime consequetur, sed just
condemnabitur, et a civitate nostra pelletur ut corruptor et pestilens, et
membrum putridum et inutile, et commune corpus Ecclesiae violans. 5ly. When the
Acts of this Synod were publicly read, Post Lectionem, Basilius amicus
Christi, and magnus Imperator dixit, Dicat nunc quicunque voluerit ex
sedentibus in hac sancta et universali Synodo, in quo istorum haesitet vel
ambiget, quae nunc lecta sunt. Sancta Synodus exclamavit, Omnibus placent quae
lecta sunt; omnes eisdem ipsis concordamus, omnes libenter subscribimus. Item,
post lectum ter: inum Synodi, Basilius Imperator ad Synodum dixit; Dicat nunc
Sancta and Universalis Synodus, Si omnibus sanctissimis Episcopis
concordantibus ac consentientibus praesens terminus sit depromptus; oportet
enim divina quaeque cum universorum consensu et concordantia in Ecclesiastis
praedicari et confirmari collegus. Sancta Synodus dixit, Omnes ita sapimus,
omnes ita praedicamus; omnes concinentes and consentientes prompte
subscribimus. Hoc est veritatis judicium, hoc est justitiae decretum, etc. 6ly.
By his and the other Emperors approbations and ratifications of the Acts of
this Synod by their Subscriptions in this form, after all the Bishops and their
Delegates had subscribed them. Post quos tandem subscripserunt Imperatores his
verbis. Basilius, Constantinus, and Leo, perpetui Augusti, Christo Deo fideles
Principes Romanorum, et magni Imperatores sanctam hanc et universalem Synodum
suscipientes, et omnibus quae ab ipsa definita et scripta sunt, concordantibus,
subscribimus manu propria. To which subscription, Benius subjoyns this his
observation: In qua subscriptione Imperatorum, hoc obiter advertendum est, quod
aiunt quidem, suscipientes et concordantes, non autem definientes; id enim
Episcoporum est, non Principum: when as all the premised Presidents of former
Councils resolve, that Emperors and Kings had the chiefest hand in prescribing,
enacting, defining, confirming, as well as receiving and assenting to their
Acts and Constitutions; And the Popes Legates presiding and representing his
person therein, subscribed only consensi, not definientes, Anastatius in
Hadriano 2. p. 139, 140. Cent. Magd. 9. c. 9. col. 439, 440. Zonaras Annal.
Tom. 3.
which the Greek Bishops only used. 7ly. There fell out a Notable difference
between the Popes Legates and the Greek and Oriental Bishops, about the form of
subscribing the Acts and Canons of this Synod. Cum ad subscriptionem actus
esset res deducta, Pontificii deprehendunt, Graecos de suo exemplari de
Epistola Nicholai, ea quae de land Imp. Ludovici erant scripta, avulsisse,
propterea quod moleste ferrent alii Imperatoris et Caesaris nomen tribui, quam
suo Domino: quare oboritur ea de re contentio. Romani subscribere denegant,
nisi illa restituatur. Graeci respondent, in actis Synodalibus non esse de Imp.
sed de Solius Domini laud tractandum. Romani autem metuentes sui Pontificis
severitatem, indefinite subscribunt; Surius, Tom. 3. p. 543, 544.
Ego Donatus Dei gratia Episcopus Ostiensis Ecclesiae, locum obtinens Domini
mei Adriani, huic sanctae ac universali Synodo praesidens, usque ad voluntatem
ejusdem eximii Praesulis ad omnia ut superius legitur consensi, and manu
propria subscripsi. See Su^ius, p. 531.
Eodem modo and alii duo Legati subscripserunt. His peractis, quidam ex
Graecorum Episcopis Imperatorem adeunt, and queruntur, per libellos, quod
initio scribere, juxta formam Pontificis coacti sunt, Constantinopolitanam
Ecclesiam plane in potestate Romani Pontificis esse, nec posse unquam
libertatem pristinam recuperari, nisi libelli Pontificiis extorqueantur, et
sibi reddantur. Agitur ea de re magna contentione cum Pontificiis, ac aegerrime
impetratur restitutio. After which Ignatius the restored Patriarch of
Constantinople subscripsit sic: Ignatius misericordia Dei Ecclesiae
Constantinopoleos, Novae Romae sanctam hanc and universalem Synodum suscipiens,
and omnibus quae ab ea judicata and scripta sunt, concordans, and definiens
subscripsi manu propria. Eadem forma usi sunt etiam Legati Patriarcharum
Orientis; whereby they avoided the snare they were like to be entangled in by
the Popes Legates policy. Cent. Magd. 9. col: 440, 441, 442. Philip Morney
Historia Papatus, p. 182. Anastatius in Hadriano 2. p. 340, 341.
9ly. That there fell out another difference and hot contest between the Roman
Legates and Grecians in this Council, to whose Jurisdiction the Bulgarians
(newly converted to the faith) should belong; whether to the Pope and Church of
Rome, or the Greek Church and Patriarch of Constantinople? they having Greek
Zonaras Tom: 3. Cent. Magd. 9. col. 13, 14.
Priests that converted, preached to, and resided among them, before the Pope
sent any Latin Priests to convert them; This was left undecided, Ignatius
refusing to give away the right of his See to the Pope, though restored by his
means; or to read the Popes Letter to him, not to send any Greek Priest among
the Bulgarians, though conjured by him not to do it. 10ly. Cent. Magd: col.
442, 443.
That the Popes Legates returning to Rome. were taken prisoners by the Sclavi,
and bonis omnibus atque autentico, in quo omnes subscriptiones erant, privati,
qui Imperialibus and Apostolicis literis vix liberati, sine autentico actorum
libro revertuntur: so that Surius and other Romanists having no authentic
Copies of this Synod, have foisted into the fragments of it many passages
making for the Popes and Church of Romes Supremacy, the Clergies power, but
against the Emperors Jurisdiction, and Laymens presence, votes in Councils in
matters of faith, and Ecclesiastical affairs (out of Pope Nicholas, and Adrians
Letters) which was never assented to, nor recorded in the Authentic Acts of
this Synod, wherein Tom. 3. Council. p. 530.
Bahanis a Layman bare chief sway. 11ly. That Laurentius Surius himself has
prefixed before his imperfect fragments and Epitome of its Actions, De octavo
Synodo admonitio ad Lectorem, viz. Triplicem Octavam Constantinopoli habitam
Synodum, historiae loquuntur. Primam, in qua praeter fas ejecto Ignatio,
repent ex aulico and neophyto creatus est Constantinopolitana Urbis Antistes
Photius. Alteram, quae pulso Photio, restituit suae sedi Ignatium. Tertiam, sub
Johanne Octavo Romano Pontifice, qui mortuo Ignatio, pacis conciliandae causa
Photium Constantinopolitanis Episcopum reddidit. Ex his mediam, docti viri
Octavam recte ac merito oecumenicam censent dici oportere, tametsi Graeci
quidem aliter sentire videantur, quorum judicia non sunt magni penaenda. Semper
enim illi quadam (...) Conci^. (...).
mulatione feruntur erga Latinam Ecclesiam, and difficile est morosis ingeniis
per omnia satisfacere, etc. Sed iis omissis, hoc te lector admonitum volumus,
nos dare quidem in praesentiarum legendam tibi Octavam Synodum, sed ita tamen,
ut multa ex ejus Actionibus desiderentur. Neque enim habuimus exemplar
integrum, sed ab illis mutua^ sumus, qui in compendium and epitomen ipsas
Actiones redigere voluerint. Sub finem tamen quaedam adjuximus, ex aliis bona
fide collectis, ad eandem Synodum pertinentia. 2ly. It is observable, that the
true cause of Photius his deposition, and Ignatius his restitution by the
Emperor Basilius, and this Synod, was, because (...) Magd. 9. c. (...) 26.
Basilius prohibitus fuit a Communione per Photium Patriarcham, propter caedem
Michaelis Imperatoris; not because he was made Patriarch in his stead, being a
mere Courtier and Layman before, against the Canons; St. Ambrose, with sundry
others being made Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, yea Popes, in the Eastern
and Western Churches, and England, though mere Laymen and Courtiers when
elected; yea after Ignatius his death, Photius was restored to his
Patriarchship notwithstanding this exception. 13ly. It is worthy consideration
what advantage Pope Nicholas the 1. and Adrian the 2d made of these schisms and
differences between Ignatius and Michael, Photius and Basilius, Patriarchs and
Emperors of Constantinople, to advance their own usurped Supremacy over the
Greek Emperors and Church, all other Princes, Prelates, and Councils
themselves, if their Epistles, Rescripts registered by Gratian and others be
genuine, not forged, as many justly repute them. For Pope Nicholas in his
Letters to the Emperor Michael, upon the complaint of Ignatius, that he was
unjustly deposed by the Emperor, took upon him not only most insolently to
revile, check, and trample upon the Emperor Michael, but likewise to enlarge
his own Papal power beyond all bounds, and to deny, abridge, abolish the
Emperors ancient Ecclesiastical Right and Jurisdiction: Rescripta Nicholai
Papae 1. ex Gratiani volumine in unum collecta per Joan: Cochlae^m. Surius
Council. Tom. 3. p. 512, 513 514, 531, 533, 537.
averring, 1. That Popes have an Universal Jurisdiction over all Patriarchs,
Archbishops, and Bishops, to receive appeals from, and restore them to their
Sees whereof they were deprived, either by Emperors, Kings or Councils, by
their Papal authority. 2. That Popes have power to summon General, National or
Provincial Synods for this purpose, without Emperors or Kings assents; and to
enjoin Emperors to suppress all Councils, Synods enacting any thing to the
prejudice of the Pope or Church of Rome, as mere wicked Conventicles. 3ly. That
Emperors, Kings, or Laymen ought not to be present, much less to preside in
any Synods or Councils where Ecclesiastical matters are debated, nor have any
authority to intermeddle with, or to make Laws, Constitutions for the Church
or Clergy, but only Popes and Bishops. 4ly. That Emperors and Kings have no
right, power to judge or dethrone Popes, Bishops, or other Clergymen, for any
crimes, nor yet to elect, promote, constitute Bishops, or confer Bishoprics,
but only Popes and their Delegates. 5ly. That Popes may judge, excommunicate,
depose, Emperors, Kings and other Laymen. 7ly. That the Jurisdiction, power,
office of Emperors and Kings, is confined by God and Christ, only to worldly or
secular, not extended to Ecclesiastical, religious, or divine affairs, which
belong wholly and solely to Popes, Bishops, and Churchmen. 7ly. That Popes and
Prelates by their Canons and Constitutions may repeal, null, control the
Laws, Edicts of Kings, or Emperors; but they can neither null nor repeal their
Canons, Constitutions, nor act ought against them. These with other
Antichristian Paradoxes Pope Adrian broached, decreed, upon the score of
Ignatius, and his successors have since incorporated them into the body of
their Canon Laws.

After the death of Caro^us Calvus, A^no 878
Pope John the 9th. intended to make and Crown Ludovicus Balbus Emperor, but
the Senate and Citizens of Rome standing for Carolus Crassus, against the
bribed Pope, who persisted obstinate, they thereupon cast him into prison, from
whence he escaping, fled into France for succor, and there Crowned Ludovicus
Balbus Emperor: Charles in the mean time seizing upon Rome, called the Pope out
of France to Rome by menaces; who returning thither upon his summons, crowned
Charles Emperor in Rome, to purchase his peace with him, that so he might
safely reside there. An Argument of his Supremacy over this Pope.

Anno 884
per Caroli Crassi absentiam, qui tunc exercitum ab Italia in Normannos
diripientes Galliam eduxerat; encouraged by his predecessors Usurpations upon
the Emperors ancient right in the election and confirmation of Popes, proceeded
one step further, utterly to abolish it for the future. Tantae audaciae and
supercilii fuit, ut mox adepto Papatu, Decretum faceret, ut in creando
Pontifice, non amplius expectaretur Imperatoris authoritas, sed ut Romae semper
essent libera and Cleri and popul. suffragia. If we believe Gratian, this
Decree of his (or another after it) extended further, even to deprive all
Emperors and Kings of their rights in electing, promoting, or confirming any
Bishops: Gratian Distinctio 6^.
Nullus Laicorum Principum vel p^t^ntum semet inserat electioni aut promotioni
Patriarchae, Metropolitae, aut cujuslibet Episcopi, n^ videlicet inordinata and
incongrua fiat electio, vel confusio, vel contentio: praesertim cum nullam in

velle monstraverit. From this Antichristian Decree, controuling the practi^e of
the Church, and revoking the undoubted right both of Emperors, Kings, Princes,
and Laymen, in the election of Bishops in all preceding ages, Crantzius (and
Balaeus out of him) observes; Sic ausi sunt Pontifices ac Romanorum improbitas,
Imperatores suos contemnere dum Imperii virtus elangueret: Unde quod
antecessores sui multis am annis parturierant, ipse uno foetu edito, in lucem
protulit. Porro hanc rem tentavit Prior Nicholaus primus: sed ad effectum, ut
ipsi loquuntur, non perduxit. Atque hic perpende (...), quomodo per hoc
Decretum, jus Imperatoribus omne quod in Pontificem atque Vrbem Romanam
habuere, sit ademptum: Ita ut in hoc foetu Pontifices magno cum Triumpho,
superiores ac victores evaserint. Videbis eos adhuc majora tentare, and non
cessare donec sese extulerint super omne quod dicitur Deus, aut quod colitur, 2
These. 2. ut dicant ejus adoratores, Quis similis bestiae? aut quis poterit

Clergy, admonishing them of, and enjoining them to perform their Pastoral
duties with all diligence; which they performing, Haberetis me omnibus
Ecclesiae Christi adversantibus, and vestro Sacerdotali ministerio
renitentibus, oppositissimum bellatorem, etc. Upon report of the Emperors
Speech to the Council, all the Clergy and Nobility standing up, blessed God,

Lord Jesus Christ, qui Ecclesiae suae sanctae tam piam and mitem censolatorem,

of the Canons concerning excommunicated persons contemning the censures of the

about the year 920. against his Allegiance, revolting from King Charles the 3.
of France, to Henry his Enemy, by great sums of money given to him and his
followers, procured a grant of this Bishopric from him, who by force and
menaces enforced Archbishop Herimannus to consecrate him, procuring sundry
Clerks and Laymen likewise to swear, That King Charles had conferred this
Bishopric upon him: Whereupon King Charles writ a Letter to the Bishops of his
Realm against this intruder: Qui contra Regalem agens potestatem, contra quoque
Apostoli dicta ubi dicitur, Deum timete, Regem honorificate; Et, Qui potestati
resistit, Dei ordinationi resistit; non est enim potestas nisi a Deo: Et
adversus cytharedi David dicta, ubi ad Dominum loquitur; Imposuisti homines
super capita nostra: Quique ultra Rhenum ad inimicos nostros proficiscens,
minimeque reminiscens Sacramentorum suorum nobis promissorum, eaque retro
deorsum abjiciens, ab Henrico inimico nostro Episcopatum Tungrensis Ecclesiae
expetivit, suaque damnatione contra omnia statuta tam sacrorum patrum quam
Regum, viz. antecessorum nostrorum usurpavit, etc. commanding them to ordain
Ruherus Bishop in his place, upon the petition of the Laity and Clergy of that
Church to the King, whom they had unanimously elected by his License, which
they did accordingly. Pope John the 10. in his Epistle to Herimannus Archbishop
of Colen, affirmed that this forcible intrusion and consecration of Helduinus
into this Bishopric, absque Clericorum electione and Laicorum acclamatione,
and Kings assent, was illegal, and against the Apostles rule, Lay hands
suddenly on noman; cum prisca consuetudo vigeat, qualiter nullus alicui Clerici
Episcopatum confer debeat, nisi Rex, cui divinitus sceptra collata sunt.
Concluding, Quia nos Caroli Regis decus nullo modo auferre volumus, sed pro
vigore atque dilectione vel consanguinitate nostri dilecti filii Berengarii
gloriosissimi Imperatoris, ut prior antecessorum suorum Regum mos fuit, eum ita
illibatam atque inconcussam Dominationem obtinere delectamur: et sicut Priores
suos antecessores nostrorum antecessorum authoritate, Episcopum per unamquamque
Parochiam ordinare probabiliter statutum est, ita ut Carolus Rex faciat
confirmando jubemus. A clear Papal concession and ratification of this their
Royal prerogative of conferring Bishoprics.

Herebertus Earl of Aquitaine coming to Rhemes persuaded the Clergy and people
to elect Hugo his son (not above 5 years old) for their Bishop; and sent to
Rodulphus King of Burgundy to confirm his election by his authority; who
thereupon by advice of some Bishops, Remensem Episcopatum committit Hereberto
(Comiti) aequitatis censura disponendum atque regendum ab ipso: Qui etiam
legatos Ecclesiae, cum Abbone praesule Romam mittere satagit, hujus electionis
decretum secum ferentis, and assensum Papae super eum petentes. Johannes itaque
Papa interveniente Abbone presule, petitioni little assensum praebens,
Episcopium Remense Abboni Episcopo delegat, quae sunt Episcopalis ministerii ab
ipso in eodem Episcopio tractanda and sirmanda decernens. Abbo being Guardian
only of the spiritualties, and Count Herebertus of the temporalties during
Hughs minority; the Earl by force of arms turned many Clerks and Laymen out of
their benefices and possessions belonging to the Archbishopric, disposing of
them prolibitu suae voluntatis, quibuscunque placuerit; A tumult arising
thereupon, his soldiers slew two Canons in the Cloisters of the Church; After
which he called a Synod of 6. Bishops of the Province of Rhemes, apud
Trosteium, Anno 927. Rege tamen Rodulpho contradicente, In the mean time, Pope
John being apprehended and kept Prisoner by Wido, and King Rodolph falling out
with Herebertus, Rodulphus Rex literas Remis mittit, ad Clerum and populum, pro
electione Praesulis celibranda: ad quas illi respondent, id agere se non posse,
salvo suo electo, (to wit, Hugh the infant) and electione quam fecerant,

it, Conjunctis igitur sibi nonnullis Episcopis ex Francia and Burgundia, facit
ordinari hac in sede Artoldum quendam ex eoenobio sancti Remigii monachum,
without any election, by his own regal authority; who above one year after
received his Pall from Pope John. Artoldus excommunicating Herebertus for
invading and detaining some Towns belonging to his Church, Anno 940. thereupon
Herebertus with his friends and certain Bishops, wasted the villages which
belonged to the Bishopric, with fire and sword, besieged and took Rhemes, then
by persuasions of friends and menaces forced Artoldus Episcopii se precuratione
vel potestate abdicare, and to accept of the Abbey of Saint Basol in lieu
thereof: which done, they consecrated and installed Hugh for their Bishop,
asserentibus, fautoribus ejus, quod Artoldus, nequaquam electus, sed per
violentiam fuerit intromissus, seseque Episcopali abdicaverit ditione; Soon
after the Legates of Rhemes bringing Hugo a Pall from Pope Stephen, Artoldus
breaking all his forced agreements with Hugh and Herbert, repaired to King
Ludovicus, to whom he complained of the injury; who thereupon besieged Rhemes
so long, that Archbp. Hugh unable to hold out, or make any composition without
quitting his Archbishopric, secretly departed the City after 3. days siege,
to avoid the putting out his eyes, if taken prisoner. Anno 547

between these Competitors, Synodus postea Verduni habetur, where sundry
Archbishops, Bishops and Abbots assembled to that end; Anno 94^

venire noluit. Upon which contempt, Vniversa Synodus Artoldo Remense regendum
decernit Episcopium. Soon after Indicitur Synodus, quae and convenit in
Ecclesiam Sancti Petri in prospectu Mosomi, ex Diocaesi Trevirensi atque
Remensi. Veniens autem illuc Hugo Praesul, and locu us cum Rotberto
Archiepiscopo, Synodum noluit ingredi. Agapit. 2^
Literas vero quasdam er nomine Agapeti Papae misit ad Episcopos per Clericum
suum, qui eas Roma detulerat, nihil auctoritatis canonicae continentes, sed hoc
tantum praecipientes, ut Hugoni Remense redderetur Episcopium. Quibus lectis,
responderunt Episcopi, non esse dignum vel congruum, ut Apostolicae Legationis
mandatum, quod dudum Rotbertus Archiepiscopus, deferente Frederico
Magontiacensi Praesule coram Regibus, et Episcopis susceperat, intermitterent
propter has literas quae insidiator, aemulus Artoldi Praesulis exhibebat: immo
quod regulariter caeperant Canonice pertractaretur. Sicque praecipitur recitari
capitulum xix. Carthaginensis Concilii de accusato and accusatore. Quo
recitato, dijudicatum est juxta diffinitionem hujus Capituli, ut Artoldo
communionem et Parochiam Remensem retinente, Hugo qui ad duas jam Synodes
evocatus venire centemps^rat, a communione and regimine Remensis Episcopii
abstiner^t, donec ad universalem Synodum sese purgaturus occurreret. Ipsumque
Capitulum mex in Charta describi feceruat Episcopi coram se, subnectentes hanc
etiam diffinitionem suam, and eidem Hugoni miserunt. Qui post alteram diem
eamdem Chartam Rotberto Pontifici remisit, hoc verbis remandans, quod ipsorum
judicio nequaquam obediturus esset. Interea literae proclamationis Artoldi
Praesulis ad Romanam diriguntur sedem Dominus igitur Agapitus Papa, Vicarium
suum Marinum Episcopum misit ad Othonem Regem, propter evocandum et aggregandum
generalem Synodum, (as proper only for the Emperor to summon.) Literae quoque
ipsius Papae mittuntur ab Urbe quibusdam speciatim Episcopis, vocantes eos ad
eandem Synodum Congregato, denique Synodo in Pallatio Engulenheim, recitata
sunt haec quae sequuntur coram Regibus et Episcopis, Hermannus Contractus, An.

present therein. This general Synod being assembled, all the premises
concerning Artoldus and Hugo, with the Popes Letter, commanding Hugh to be
restored, were read before them. The Synod upon debate passed the same sentence
for Artoldus against Hugo, notwithstanding the Popes Letter, as the last Synod
did, approving their sentence, and excommunicating Hugo. From this History I
shall observe; 1. That the Archbishops of Rhemes were usually elected by the
Clergy and people, but yet by the Kings license, who had a power to confirm or
reject the person elected. 2ly. That the Kings of France, in special cases, did
confer Bishoprics on whom they pleased, without any precedent election by
the Clergy and people. 3ly That they committed the Temporalties of Bishoprics
to Noblemen and others, during the vacancy of the Sees, or Minority of the
Bishop. 4ly. That they had a just power to remove Bishops unduly elected, or
forcibly intruded into Bishoprics, even by force of arms when necessary. 5ly.
That both the Kings of France, and successive Synods, reproved, condemned the
Popes own Letters as Un-canonical, and gave sentence against them, which
sentence was afterward approved by a General Synod. 6ly. That Kings may and
ought to remove unfitting or scandalous Bishops, notwithstanding the Popes
Bulls, Palls, Mandates to confirm, or continue them. 7ly. That no Synods ought
to be summoned, but by Kings, or their Authority within their Realms; and that
if any be otherwise called by Popes, Archbishops, or others, they may and ought
to prohibit them, and their Bishops resort unto them. This is evident by the
ancient memorable Inhibition of Sigebertus King of France, to Desiderius
Cadurcensis Episcopus, in this his Letter directed to him.

Senators, Chief Officers, certain Commoners, and Military Officers of Rome,
(mentioned by name in Luitprandus, who at large relates the proceeding in this

of the Council, who the Pope declared to be present in so holy and famous a

of being accursed and condemned by Christ in the great day of Judgment, and
that there were as many Witnesses of his crimes, as there were soldiers in the
Emperors Army. Hereupon he was summoned by the Emperors Letters to answer these
crimes inserted into the summons; but the Messengers not finding him (he hiding
himself in woods) after a treble search and summons; thereupon the Emperor, as
President, said, Expectavimus adventum ejus, ut praesente eo quod nobis egerit
quaereremus, verum quoniam eum non affuturum certo scimus, quam perfide
nobiscum egerit, ut diligenter agnoscatis etiam atque etiam flagitamus. Notum
itaque vobis facimus, Archiepiscopis, Presbyteris, Diaconis, reliquoque Clero,
necnon et Comitibus, Iudicibus, omnique plebi, quod idem Johannes Papa
oppressus a Berengario, atque Adelberto, rebellibus nostris, misit nobis in
Sexoniam nuncios, rogans, ut pro amore Dei in Italiam veniremus, and Ecclesiam
Sancti Petri, ac seipsum ex saucibus eorum liberaremus. Nos vero, adjuvante
Deo, quantum fecerimus, non est necesse dicere, ut in praesentiarum, videtis.
Ereptus vero mea opera ex eorum manibus, and honori debito restitutus, oblitus
juramenti et fidelitatis quam mihi supra corpus S. Petri promisit; eundem
Adelbertum Roman venire fecit, and contra me defendit, seditiones fecit: and
videntibus nostris Militibus, Dux belli factus, lorica and galea est indutus.
Quid super hoc sancta Synodus decernat, edicat? Whereupon, Ad haec Romani
Pontifices, reliquus Clerus, et cunctus populus dixerunt, Inauditum vulnus
inaudito est cauterio exurendum. Si corruptis moribus sibi soli, and non
cunctis obesset, quoquo modo tolerandus esset. Quot prius Casti, hujus facti
sunt imitatione incaesti? Quot probi, hujus exemplo conversationis sunt
reprobi? Petimus itaque magnitudinem Imperii vestri, monstrum illud nulla
virtute redemptum a vitiis, a Sancta Ecclesia Romana pelli, aliumque loco ejus
constitui, qui nobis exemplo bonae conversationis praeesse valeat, et prodesse
sibi: recte vivat, ac been vivendi nobis exemplum praebeat. Tunc Imperator.
Placet inquit, quod dicitis: nihilque gratius nobis, quam ut talis, qui huic
sanctae et universali sedi praeponatur, inveniri possit. His dictis, omnes una
voce dixerunt: Leonem venerabilem sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Protoscriniarium,
virum approbatum, ad summum Sacerdotii gradum nobis in Pastorem eligimus, ut
sit summus and universalis Papa Romanae Ecclesiae, reprobato ob improbos mores
Ioanne Apostata. Quum haec omnes tertio dixissent, annuente Imperatore,
nominatum Leonem ad Lateranense Palatium, secundum consuetudinem, cum laudibus
ducunt: and certo tempore in Ecclesia Sancti Petri (Leonem adhuc Laicum, as
some record) ad summum Sacerdotium sancta consecratione attollunt, and fideles
se ei affuturos, jurejurando promittuut. Pope John thus legally deposed, Minime
sibi quiescendum putabat, sed simulc intelligebat, Othonem praesidium quod
penes se in urbe fuerat, demisisse, ne populum Romanum minime gravaret; mox
Proceres Romanos clandestinis literis solicitat, ut Imperatorem et ipsum quoque
Leonem de medio tollant, ut jugum Caesareum excuterent, ut qui parva hominum
manu stipatus esset: deinde largissime promisit, se ipsis omnes Ecclesiae the
sauros sponte traditurum and concessurum esse. Hac ampla spe inescati per^^di
Romani, rem mota seditione quamprimum aggrediuntur. Milites vero Imperatoris
summa alacritate arma capientes, tantam stragem in seditiosorum cohorte edunt,
ut ipse Imperator, misericordia erga sceleratos affectus, receptui caneret,
vindictamque militum coerceret. Not long after, the Emperor departing from
Rome, this lecherous, treacherous Pope, Meretrices plures, easque genere non
ignobiles, cum quibus commercium habuerat, by his secret messages and
instigations, Nobiles Romanos concitaverunt, promissis Ecclesiarum thesauris,
ut Iohannem rursus in Urbem reciperent, and Leonem comprehensum de medio
tollerent. Quod and ipsi statim fecerunt, dejecto Leone quem Caesar creaverat:
qui mirabiliter tamen evasit carnificum manus, atque ad Imperatorem confugit.
Johannes sanctissimus scortorum leno votis potitus, caput sanctae Romanae
Ecclesiae constituitur. Sede occupata, Iohanni Diacono Cardinali manum amputat:
Azorio Scriniario linguam praecidit, duos digitos amputat, and nares ei
mutilat. O Apostolici Apostolica prorsus facinora! Then calling a Synod of his
own Creatures at Rome, Ille Synodo collecta Leonem deposuit, and ejus gesta
cassavit, statutumque est, ab Othone Imperatore and Leone habitam, non
nominandam Synodum, sed prostibulum faciens adulteris. Quicunque ergo a Leone
ordinati sunt, privantur honor quem ab ipso acceperunt; jussique sunt eorum
proscriptionem praesentare in charcula, haec continente; Pater meus nihil sibi
habuit, nihil mihi dedit: et sic depositi remansecunt in illis gradibus quos
habuerunt antequam a (...) ordinati. The Emperor informed of these proceedings,
marched with his Army toward Rome to chastise the seditious, treacherous
Romans, and depose this lecherous Pope; but before his arrival there, Johannes
Papa se cum uxore cujusdam oblectans, a Diabolo in tempore percutitur; (as
Radulphus de Diceto and others story; though some relate it was by her husband)
and sine Viatico Dominico obiit, dignas sceleratistimae vitae dans poenas; and
ut vitae moribus, exitus justo Dei judicio responderet.

and irritatum in conspectu haberent, attamen prodigioso partis furore, contra
juramentum quod Imperatori fecerant, se nunquam electuros Papam sine ejus, et
sine filii ejus Ottonis contensu, Benedictum quendam propria auctoritate Papam
constituunt, Leone qui in exercitu Caesaris erat posthabito. Hac contumelia ac
perfidia graviter offensus Imperator, primum obsessam and duriter pressam
Civitatem, cogit facere deditionem; atque de paucis supplicium sumit. Postea
Synodum Romae absque mora cogit, multis Episcopis, Abbatibus, Sacerdotibus,
Clericis, Monachis, et praecipuis er populo praesentibus, in Ecclesia
Lateranensi: In which Synod Pope Leo being restored to his See, sitting with
the Emperor, (to whose hands Pope Benedict the 5. was delivered up) by the
Emperors command, advenit Benedictus Apostolicae sedis invasor, eorum qui se
eligerant, manibus adductus, Pontificalibus vestibus indutus. Quem Benedictus
Cardinalis Archidiaconus, tali est Sermon aggressus. Qua tibi authoritate,
quave lege, O invasor, haec pontificalia indumenta usurpasti, superstite hoc
praesente Domino nostro, venerabili Papa Leone, quem tu nobiscum, accusato and
reprobato Iohanne, ad Apostolicatus culmen eligisti? Number inficiari potes
praesenti Domino Imp: juramento promisisse, unquam te cum saeteris Romanum
Papam electurum, aut ordinaturum absque illius filiique sui Regis Otthonis
consensu? Benedictus respondit, Si quid peccavi, miseremim mei. Tunc Imperator
effusis lachrymis, quam misericors esset ostendens, rogavit Synodum, Ne
Benedicto praejudicium fieret: si vellet et posset, ad interrogata responderet:
quod si non posset, aut nollet, ac se culpabilem redderet, tamen pro timore Dei
misericordiam aliquam inveniret. Quo audito, ad Domini Leonis Papae pedes,
ipsiusque Imperatoris, idem Benedictus concite procidens, Se peccasse, seque
Sanctae Romanae sedis invasorent esse acclamavit: post haec pallium sibi
abstulit, quod simul cum Pontificali ferula, quam manu gestabat, Domino Papae
Leoni reddidit. Quam ferulam idem Papa sregir, and fractam populo ostendit.
Deinde Benedictum in terra sedere praecepit, cui Casulam, quam Planetam vocant,
cum Stola pariter abstulit; post autem omnibus Episcopis dixit, Benedictum
Sanctae and Apostolicae sedis Romanae invasorem, omni Pontificatus et
Presbyteratus honor privamus: ob eleemosynam vero Domini Imperatoris Otthonis,
cujus sumus opera in sedem debitam restituti, Diaconatus eum ordinem habere
permittimus, et non jam Romae, sed in exilium destinamus. ^uit autem ablegatus
Benedictus Hamburgum, ubi in exi^^o vitam finivit.

Porro in hoc Concilio, de jure eligendi Pontificem, deque bonis Imperatoris in
Italia actum est. Pontifex enim non solum grati^udims, sed etiam Justitiae
gratia restituit, aut potius confirmat, quae ad Imperatorem per^nebant.

This Decree of Pope Leo, is prefaced by Distinct. 63. Item Leo Papa.
Gratian himself with this Rubric, Electio Romani Pontificis ad Ius pertinet
Imperatoris, and incorporated into the body of the Canon Law, authorized by
sundry Popes: Which being made, ratified by two famous Popes, Adrian and Leo,
in two Councils held in Rome it self, with the suffrage and unanimous consent
of all the Clergy. Senators, Officers and People of Rome in a most solemn
manner, and the violators thereof subjected to such severe Ecclesiastical and
Civil punishments, to prevent all future Schisms, seditions, symonaical
contracts, indirect practices, and interpositions of prevalent infamous Whores,
and Strumpets in the election of Popes, for the peace, honor, benefit of the
whole Church, no succeeding Popes had any power at all to null or revoke by
their Pontifical usurped power upon any pretext, without the concurrent
authority at least of a General Council, and universal consent of all the
Clergy, Senators, and people of Rome, as Defensoris Pacis, l. 2^ 25.
Marsilius Patavinus proves at large. Distinction Sect. Apost^^^cam, et A(...).
Bartholomeus Buxiensis, and Dr. Thierry in their Gloss upon this Decree, in
Gratian, demand this Question: Cum haec privilegia fuerint omnibus
(Imperatoris) successoribus data, quare non utuntur eis? To which they return
these unsatisfactory Answers: Quia Imperator eis renunciavit: A gross mistake,
since no Emperor since the reign of Otho ever renounced it by any Charter: and
Gratians conclusion, Ex istis Constitutionibus and pacto Ludovici Imperatoris,
deprehenduntur Imp^ratores renunciasse privilegiis quae de electione Summi
Pontificis Adrianus Papa Carolo Imperatori, and ad imitationem ejus, Leo Papa
Ottonis primo Regi Theutonicorum fecerat, is but a mere Nonsequitur,
contradicted by his pr^mises; whereupon they subjoyn these ensuing answers,
Item, quia per abusum ea pe^diderunt: (without expressing any abuse, the Roman
Clergy, people, and Cardinals since having much more for feited their right to
elect Popes, for their manifold abuses therein, recorded by sundry Historians)
Item, quia ex causa fu^rint eis concessa, unde cessante causa ipsa,
cessaverunt. Nec obstat quod hic dicitur de successoribus; quia hoc
intelligendum est de illis successoribus, qui hoc impetrare possunt: A pretry
equivocating evasion worthy Popes and Popish Canonists. They further propound
this second question on this Popes Decree: Nunquid Papa posset Imperatori
potestatem dare, ut deponeret ipsum? Which they thus affirmatively resolve:
Sic, in Haresi, (therefore a Pope may be an Heretic, and deposed for Heresy
by the Emperor;) et de consensu Cardinalium: immo, in omnibus se potest
subjicere ei; Therefore the Emperor in all things is superior to the Pope, not
the Pope to him; since this Pope Leo by his Bull and Charter resigned,
regranted to this Emperor Otho, not only the Right of electing and confirming
Popes, and the Investitures of Bishops, but also what ever Lands, Cities,
Territories, Possessio^^, Gifts, either Charles or Pipin, or Justinian, or
Aripert had given of the Regalities of the Kingdom of Italy, or the Empire to
St. Peter, or the Church of Rome: which Bull or Charter is recorded at large in

this; stiling the Synod, Imposturam, and ascititiam Synodum, Pseudo-Synodus,
Pope Leo, Pseudo-Papa, and this Bull or Decree, Bulla seu Decretum
commentitium; without any authority but their own (as they branded the Synod
and Decree of Pope Adrian beforementioned:) But this impudent forgery, and
calumny of these Impostors, is not only refuted by Gratian himself,
Bartholomeus Buxiensis, Dr. Thierry, and other Glossers, but likewise by
Theodoricus de Niem, Marsilius Patavinus, Paulus Diaconus, Luitprandus,
Martinus Polonus, Hermannus Schedel, Crantzius, Sigonius, Lupoldus, Nauclerus,
Platina, Radulphus de Columna, Fasciculus Temporum, W^rnerus, Onuphrius,
Radulphus de Diceto, Dr. Barnes, Balaeus, Mornay, Bishop Jewel, Dr.
Crakenthorp, the Century Writers, and others forecited; but likewise by
Cardinal C^^^anus, Cardinal Cameracensis, and Cardinal Petrus de Alliaco, as
eminent Pillars of the Church of Rome as Baronius, and by Baronius Anno 996. n.

himself; who recites this very D^cree he formerly denied, as authentic, and
acknowledges Leo to be a lawful Pope: Which Decree is further attested,
averred by the 4. famous Universities of Oxford, Paris, Prague, and Rome it
self, in a Treatise written by them all to Pope Urba^, and Wenceslaus the
Emperor, about the year 1374. wherein they assert, Pope Leo the 8. by reason
of the malice and turbulency of the Romans, decreed, that none should be made
Pope, but with the con^ent of the Emperor; and further, with the consent of the
Cardinals, Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons, yea, of the whole Clergy and people
of Rome, he remised, regranted, resigned to Otho, and his Successors, the whole
Donations in Italy, which were formerly made to the Roman Church, by Justinian,
Pipin, Charles, and others: So as (by their resolutions) these Decrees and
Charters of Leo remain unquestionable, and cannot be evaded.

About the year 971. Peter the Governor, with the two Consuls, and 12.
Senators of Rome, apprehended this Pope John in the Church of Lateran for his
tyrippy, and adhering to the Emperor, imprisoning him near 11. months, and
then (...) him into Campania; of which the Emperor Otho being informed, marched
to Rome with an Army, and there, by his Sovereign power punished some of the
seditions Citizens with death, others with banishment, the residue with
confiscation of their goods, delivering Peter to the Pope, to inflict what
punishments he pleased on him, who used him with most inhumane, unchristian,
barbarous tyranny.

Pope Benedict the 6. Anno 974
A Cynthio Romano Cive ob quasdam nequitias captus, in Castello Sancti Angeli
intrusus, eodem carcere non multo post laqueo stragulatus est, as most relate;
others affirm that he was there starved to death. De tanta illa injuria nullam
esse sumptam vindictam, vel a Civibus Romany aversae factionis, vel ab O^hone
Imperatore non possum ego (inquit Platina) non satis admirari, praesertim cum
Otho ipse, vir optimus sit habitus, and Ecclesiae Romanae acerrimus defensor.
Sed vereor ne talia fuerunt Benedicti merita, quale praemium a Cynthio
consecutus est. Doubtless these 2. Popes thus imprisoned, punished successively
by the Roman Consuls and Magistrates for their notorious unsufferable Crimes,
were not deemed supreme heads over Emperors, or Christ's universal Church in
that age; no not in Rome it self.

Pope Boniface the 7. Malis artibus adeptus Pontificatum, Anno 976
horrendum monstrum cunctos mortales nequitia superans, etiam prioris
Pontificis sanguine cruentatus, cunctaque gubernationis officia male
ministrans, omnium apud Romanos odia incurrit; whereupon being enforced to hide
himself, he secretly stole all the precious Treasures out of St. Peter's Church,
and fled with them to Constantinople, where he sold them for a great sum of
money, wherewith he returning to Rome, made such a party against Pope John the
15. (whom the Romans had elected and made Pope in his absence) that Joannem
paratis praesidiis caepit, oculis privavit, carcere inclusit, fame necavit,
occupavitque rursus Pontificiam sedem; But dying soon after, the people were so
enraged against him, that they would not suffer his corpse to be buried; but
cadaver ejus fune ad pedes alligato, per plateas tractum, ac lanceis and contis
opprobriose confossum, (...) a Clericis beneficio sepulturae populari tralitum
est. So little did they value his pretended Sanctity or Supremacy, whiles alive
and dead.

Pope John the 16. (a Priests base Son) being elected by the Clergy and
People of Rome, soon incurred both their hatreds, for his extraordinary
covetousness; Anno 985

Romanae sedis honor, sit elargitus; Quem certe errorem (as Platina, Stella,

exemplo pervenisse cernimus. Qua quidem consuetudine nil perniciosius dici
potest, cum non ob religionem and Dei cultum, appetere Pontificatum Sacerdotes
nostri videantur, sed ut Nepotum and familiarium, nothorum and meretricum

Kings, since thus imprisoned, corrected for his vices, by the very Clergy and
people of Rome themselves, (never questioned for their proceedings against
him;) who likewise forced his Successor John the 17. to retire and exile
himself from Rome for a time.

Ludovicus King of France, An. 990, 992.
Duke Charles his brother claimed the Crown as next heir, but Hugo Caepet
obtaining it by power, Charles seized upon the City of Rhemes by the treachery
of his Nephew Arnulphus Archbishop thereof: Hereupon by the command of King
Hugo, there were two Synods called at Rhemes; in the first whereof Archbishop
Arnulphus was accused, and in the 2d. convicted of Treason against the King by
many witnesses, and thereupon deposed, excommunicated, and imprisoned. In this
2d. Synod Signinus Archbishop of Sens, president therein, related, That
Arnulphus was accused of pillaging, and betraying the City of Rhemes to the
Kings Enemies, which drew not only a scandal and suspicion upon himself, but
upon all the Clergy. Nunc, quia Religionis amore, and studio Serenissimi Regis
nostri Domini Hugonis congregati sumus, quaerendum est, quomed, tanta infamia
tacere possumus? and si frater and coepiscopus noster Arnulphus illata crimina
diluere queat, vel crimen laesae Majestatis propulsare: Scitis enim omnes nos
insimulari probo infidelitatis and perfidiae, causa unius. Si, inquiunt, justis
Episcopi utuatur legibas, si lissimique suis Regibus sunt, cur hominem
impurissimum suis legibus non puniunt? nimirum aliorum flagitia adeo moliuntur
celare, ut impune liccat eis peccare. Absit hoc ab hoc sanctissimo coetu
vestro, absit ut contra divinas ac humanas leges quenquam moliamur defendere
vel (...) re, etc. After which Siguinus said, Non patiar, discussionem fieri
ejus, quid citur Majestatis obn^xius, nisi forte convicto, (Episcopo) supplicii
indulgentia promittatur: citing 31. capur Toletani Concilii, to this purpose:
who being seconded by Daibertus, thereupon Herveus Episcopus replied, Si hoc
periculosum est (for Bishops to judge and condemn a Bishop as guilty of High
Treason) videte ne sit periculosius, judicia Ecclesiastica deinceps a
Secularibus non expectari. Consequens enim est, ad forensia Iura nos pertrahi,
si divinis legibus videmur in aliquo obniti. At quomodo sine judicio
relinquetur, quod commissum esse constiterit? vel cur contrae Principem nostrum
causabimur, si quod attingere non audebinus, iudiciaria potestate conceditur?
After some debates pro and contra, Arnulphus his Oath of Algiance to the King
(which he had apparently violated) was produced, and publicly read in these
words, Cap. 6. Cen: Magd. 10. col. 463, 464.
Ego Arnulphus gratia Dei praeveniente Remorum Archiepiscopus, promitto Regibus
Francorum, Hugoni and Roberto, me fidem purissimam servaturum, consilium and
duxilium, secundum meum scire and posse, in omnibus negotiis praebiturum:
inimicos eorum nec consilio, nec auxilio ad eorum infidelitatem scienter
adjuturum. Haec in confectu divinae Majestatis and Beatorum Spirituum, and
totius Ecclesiae assistentis
assistens promitto; pro been servatis laturus praemia aeternae benedictionis.
Si vero, quod nolo, and quod absit, ab his deviavero, omnis benedictio mea
convertatur in maledictionem, and fiant dies mei pauci, et Episcopatum meum
accipiat alter, Recedant a me amici mei, sintque perpetuo inimici. Huic vero
chirographo a me^ edito in testimonium benedictionis vel maledictionis meae
subscribo, fratresque and filios meos ut subscribant, rogo; Ego Arnulphus
Archiepiscopus. After much debate, Arnulphus his Advocates were called into the
Synod to make his defense, who principally insisted on the Decrees of Pope
Damasus, Pope Stephen, Sixtus, Julius, Symmachus, Eusebius, Adrian, Fabian, and
Anacletus, which were all read, to this effect; Quod Episcoporum judicia non
aliter quam authoritate sedis Apostolicae sunt terminanda, and that no Clerk
ought to accuse, or be heard against his own Bishop. To which was answered,
That Hildemannus Beluacensis Episcopus, and Ebo Remorum Archiepiscopus, were
imprisoned in Monasteries by Ludovicus the Emperor, and deposed by a Synod
without the Popes privity, consent, or leave first obtained: That King Huge and
his Bishops of the Province of Rhemes had voluntarily complained to Pope John
of Arnulphus his treasons, demanding his advice, how to proceed against him in
this new case, who delayed or refused to return his resolution therein;
therefore they might justly proceed against him without the Popes advice; That
Popes were now so infamous, scandalous, ignorant, etc. That they were unfit to
be Judges in any case, and other inferior Bishops of greater knowledge and
holiness, fitter to be their Judges, and all Bishops their equals.

I shall recite King Hughs Letter to the Pope, desiring him only to inform him
being ignorant, how to proceed, and what Judgment to pronounce against
Arnulphus his treasons therein recited.

Beatissimo Papae Iohanni, Cap. 25. Cent. Magd. 10. col. 484.
Hugo gratia Dei Francorum Rex. Novis atque inusitatis rebus permoti, summo
studio, summaque cura vestra consilia expetenda decrevimus, quippe cum sciamus,
vos omne tempus in divinis ac humanis studiis exigisse. Considerate ergo quae
facta sunt, and facienda praescribite, ut and sacis legibus su^^ honor
reddatur, and regalis potestas non annulletur. Arnulfus Regis Lotharii (ut
dicunt) filius, post graves inimicitias, ac scelera quae in regnum nostrum
exercuit, loco parentis adoptatus est a nobis, ac Metropoli Remorum gratis
donatus: jusjurandum praebuit, quod contra praeterita and futura valeret
Sacramenta, Libellum Chirographi conscripsit, recitavit, corroboravit,
corroborarique fecit. Milites ac omnes Cives jurare coegit, ut in nostra
persisterent Fide, si ipse aliquando in potestatem hostium deveniret. Contra
haec omnia, ut certissimi testes sunt, ipse portas hostibus patefecit, Clerum
ac populum, suae fidei creditum, captivitati and praedae distribuit. Sed esto,
eum esse addictum alienae potestati, ut ipse videri vult; ^ur Cives and Milites
pejerare cogit? Cur arma contra nos comparat? Cur urbem ac Castra contra nos
munit? Si Captus est, cur non patitur liberari? Si vi hostium oppressus, quare
non vult sibi subveniri? Et si liberatus est, cur ad nos non redit? Vocatur ad
Palatium, and venire contemnit. Invitatur ab Archiepiscopis, nihil se eis
debere respondet. Ergo qui vices Apostolorum tenetis, statuite, quid de altero
Judah fieri debeat, ne nomen Dei per nos blasphemetur, and ne forte justo dolor
permoti, ac vestra taciturnitate, urbis excidium, totiusque provinciae moliamur
incendium: nec judici Deo excusationem praetendetis, si nobis quaerentibus
atque ignorantibus, formam Iudicii dare nolueritis. This Letter makes not the
Pope the sole Judge of this Archbishop or his cause, but only craves his
advice, how this King might proceed against him, in this new case: So did the
French Bishops Letter to him sent along with it, to this effect.

Domino and Reverendissimo Papae Iohanni, Cap. 26. Cent. Magd. 10 col. 485.
Episcopi Remorum Diaeceseos. Non sumus nescii, Beatissime Pater, jamdudum
opportuisse nos expetere consulta sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae, pro ruina atque
occasu sacerdotalis ordinis, sed multitudine tyrannorum pressi, longitudine
terrarum semoti, desideria nostra hactenus implere nequivimus. Nunc itaque
vestro examini, non sine magno dolor perferimus novum atque inusitatum crimen
Arnulfi Remorum Archiescopi, qui famosus Apostate factus, locum Iudae
traditoris, olim in Ecclesia tenet, qui filius quondam Ecclesiae Laudunensis,
cum Episcopum suum dolo and fraud ceperit, Ecclesiam ejus pervaserit, ad
cumulum suae damnationis Remensem Ecclesiam sibi creditam, cum Clero and populo
captivavit: nec movet eum nostra vocatio, vel potius saluberrima exhortatio,
non Archiepiscoporum comprovincialium multoties repetita admonitio, non
canonice facta coram Deo and Angelis ejus professio, non Chirographi in
conspectu Eccleseiae recitata descriptio, non numerosa Sacramenta miris
excogitata consiliis. Stant suo vitio, quamplures Ecclesiae pastoribus
viduatae, pereunt innumerabiles populi sine Sacerdotali benedictione and
confirmatione: ipse factione tyrannica, divina humanaque jura contemens,
tyrannidem exercet. Regibus nostris, a quibus tantam Gloriam gratis consecutus
est, interitum meditatur. Ergo tandem monstro perditissimi hominis expergefacti
ivimus in Sententiam Domini dicentis; Si peccaverit in te frater tuus, vade and
corripe eum inter te, and ipsum solum. Si te audierit, lucratus es fratrem
tuum; si autem te non audierit, adhibe tecum adhuc unum vel duos, ut in ore
testium duorum vel trium stet omne verbum; Quod si non audierit eos, dic
Ecclesiae; Si autem and Ecclesiae, non audierit, sit tibi sicut Ethnicus and
Publicanus. Adesto Pater ruenti Ecclesiae, and sententiam ex sacris canonibus
promulgatam, vel potius ab ipsa veritate prolatam, profer in reum. (To wit,
only by way of advice communicated to the King and them, not of actual
execution.) Sentiamus in vobis alterum Petrum, defensorem, and corroboratorem
Christian fidei; ferat Sancta Romana Ecclesia sententiam damnationis in reum,
quem universalis damnat Ecclesia. Suffragetur nobis (by way of direction and
approbation of their proceedings in a former Synod) vestra Authoritas, and in
hujus Apostatae dejectione, and in ejus qui domni Dei praeesse possit,
Archiepiscopi nova ordinatione: Simulque invocatis Episcopis nostris fratribus,
necessaria promotione, ut sciamus and intelligamus, cur inter caeteros
Apostolatum vestrum praeferre debeamus.

The Pope receiving these Letters from the King and his Bishops against
Arnulfus, Legatos primo blande accepit; postea vero quam Hereberti Comitis
Legati (on behalf of Arnulfus) equum corpore praestantem, niveo color
insignem, cum aliis muneribus Pontifici obtulerunt; se per triduum ante januam
palatii defatigatos, nec admissos: Thereupon, infecto negotio redierunt. Upon
which account the Synod of Rhemes resolved, That they might justly proceed
against this Traiterous Archbishop without the Popes advice. In pursuit
whereof: Cap. 28 Cent. Magd. 10. col 486, 487.
Multa super his Pater Arnulfus (President in this Synod) public loquutus est,
multa cum sibi tantum assidentibus contulit, to this effect: Nos vero, inquit,
Reverendissimi Patres, Romanam Ecclesiam propter beati Petri memoriam semper
honorandam decernimus, nec decretis Romanorum Pontificum obviare contendimus;
salva tamen Authoritate Niceni Concilii, quod eadem Romana Ecclesia semper
venerata est. Statuta etiam Sacrorum Canonum diversis locis, diversis
temporibus (sed eodem Dei spiritu conditorum) in aeternum valere praecipimus,
ab omnibus servanda censemus. Duo autem sunt, quae magnopere a nobis praevideri
debent: id est, Romani Pontificis silentium, aut nova Constitutio, promulgatis
legibus Canonum vel decretis priorum praejudicare potest. Si enim silentium
praejudicat, omnes leges, omnia priorum decreta, eo.
and silente silere necesse est. Si autem nova Constitutio, quid prosunt leges
conditae, cum ad unius arbitrium omnia dirigantur? Videtis, quia his duabus
causis admissis, Ecclesiarum Dei status periclitatur: et dum legibus leges
quaerimus, nullas omnino leges habemus. Quid ergo? Number privilegio Romani
Pontificis derogabimus? minime: Sed si Romanus Episcopus is est quem scientiae
and vitae meritum commendat, nec silentium, nec nova Constitutio metuenda sunt.
Quod si vel ignorantia, vel metu, vel cupiditate abalienetur, vel conditio
invidiam facit, (quod fere sub haec tempora vidimus) Romae tyrannide
praevalente: tunc multo minus idem silentium, and nova Constitutio formidanda
sunt. Non enim is qui quolibet modo contra leges est, legibus praejudicare
potest. Sed O lugenda Roma, quae nostris majoribus clara Patrum lumina
praebuisti, nostris temporibus monstrosas tenebras futuro saeculo famosas
effudisti. Olim accepimus claros Leones, magnos Gregorios. Quid dicam de
Gelasio and Innocentio, qui omnem mundanam Philosophiam sua sapientia and
eloquentia superant? Longa series eorum est, qui sua Doctrina mundum
repleverunt. Eorum itaque dispositioni, qui vitae merito and scientia cunctos
mortales anteirent, recte universalis Ecclesia credita est; quamvis et in hac
ipsa foelicitate hoc privilegium tibi ab Affricanis Episcopis contradictum sit,
has credo quas patimur miserias magis, quam typum dominationis formidantibus.
Nam quid sub haec tempora non vidimus? Vidimus Johannem cognomento Octavianum,
in volutabro libidinum versatum, etiam contra eum Othonem, quem Augustum
creaverat, conjurasse: quo fugato, Leo Neophytus in Pontificem creatur. Sed
Otthone Caesare Roma discedente, Octavianus Romam redit, Leonem fugat: Johannem
Diaconum naso, dextris digitis, ac lingua mutilat: multaque caede primorum in
Urbe debacchatus, in brevi moritur: cui Benedictum Diaconum, cognomento
Grammaticum, Romani substituunt: eum quoque Leo Neophytus cum suo Caesare non
long post aggreditur, obsidet, capit, deponit, perpetuoque exilio in Germaniam
dirigit. Succedit Otthoni Caesari Caesar Ottho, natura, aetate, cunctos
Principes armis, consilio ac scientia superans. Succedit Romae in Pontificatus
horrendum monstrum, Malefacius, cunctos mortales nequicia superans, etiam
prioris Pontificis sanguine cruentus: sed hic etiam fugatus est, in magna
Synodo damnatus: post obitum divi Otthonis Romam redit, insignem virum
Apostolicum, Petrum Papiensis Ecclesiae prius Antistitem, data Sacramentorum
fide, ab arce Urbis dejicit, deponit: squalore carceris affectum perimit. Number
talibus monstris hominum, ignominia plenis, scientia divinarum et humanarum
rerum vacuis, innumeris Sacerdotes Dei per orbem terrarum scientia et vitae
merito conspicuos, subjici decretum est? Quid est hoc Reverendissimi Patres?
vel quonam vitio fieri credendum est, ut caput Ecclesiarum Dei, quod in sublime
erectum, gloria and honor coronatum est, ita in infima dejectum, ignominia et
dedecore deturpatum sit? Nostrum, nostrum est hoc peccatum, nostra impietas,
qui quaerimus quae nostra sunt, non quae Jesu Christi. Si enim in quovis ad
Episcopatum electo, morum gravitas, vitae meritum, divinarum ac humanarum rerum
scientia, subtiliter investigantur; quid in eo qui omnium Episcoporum Magister
videri appetit, investigandum non est? cur ergo in summa sede sic infimus
constituitur, ut etiam in Clero nullum habere locum dignus inveniatur? Quid
hunc Reverendi Patres in sub^^^ solio residentem, vest purpurea and aurea
radiantem, quid hunc (inquam) esse censetis? Nota.
Nimirum si charitate destituitur, solaque scientia inflatur, and extollitur,
Antichristus est, in Templo Dei sedens, et se ostendens tanquam sit Deus. Si
autem nec charitate fundatur, nec scientia erigitur, in Templo Dei tanquam
statua, tanquam idolum est; a quo responsa petere, marmora consulere est. Quo
ergo consultum ibimus? Evangelium docet, quendam in ficulnea ter fructum
quaesisse, and quia non repererit, succidere voluisse, sed admonitum
expectasse. Expectemus ergo primates nostros, quoad possumus: atque interim
divini verbi pabula, ubinam reperiri valiant, investigemus. Certe in Belgica
and Germania, quae vicinae nobis sunt, summus Sacerdotes Dei, in religione
admodum praestantes, inventri, in hoc sacro conven^^testes quidam sunt.
Proinde, si Regum dissidentium animositas non prohibere^, inde magis
Episcoporum judicium petendum fore videtur, quam ab ea Vrbe, quae nunc temporis
venalis exposita, ad nummorum quantitatem judicia trutinat. Quod si quispiam
dixerit, secundum Gela^ium, Romanum Ecclesiam de tota Ecclesia judicare, ipsam
ad nullius comeare judicium, nec de ejus unquam judicio judicari posse:
quanquam hoc ipsum Affricani Episcopi impossible judicant, nisi forte
(inquiunt) quisquam est qui credat, unic^ilibet posse Dominum nostrum examinis
inspirare justiciam, et innumerabilibus congregatis in Concilium Sacerdotibus
deuegare. Sed cum hoc tempore Romae nullus pene sit (ut fama est) qui Literas
didicerit, sine quibus (ut scriptum est) vix ossiarius efficitur, qua front
aliquis eorum docere audebit, quod minime didicit? Ad comparationem quippe
Romani Pontificis, in aliis Sacerdotibus ignorantia utcunque tolerabilis est;
in Romano autem, cui de fide, vita, moribus, disciplina Sacerdotum, deque
universali Ecclesia Catholica iudicandum est, intolerabilis videri potest. Is
enim est (ut quibusdam placet) qui secundum Ezechielem Prophetam, moratur in
Gazophylacio, quod respicit viam meridianam, and excubat in custodiis Templi;
Cur autem loco prior, scientia inferior, non aequo animo ferat judicium loco
inferioris, scientia prioris? Certe ipse Apostolorum Princeps non abnuit
judicium, quamvis loco minoris, Pauli scientia prioris, in faciem sibi
resistentis, quoniam non sana videbatur Doctrina Magistri; and Gregorius Papa
cum dicat, Si quae culpa in Episcopis invenitur, nescio quis Apostolicae sedi
subjectus non sit; subinfert, Cum vero culpa non exegit, omnes secundum
rationem humilitatis pares sunt. Involutus ergo criminibus, sentiat praeesse
sibi Romanum Pontificem: qui nullis atrocioribus factis praegravatur,
intelligat, parem dignamque se ac Romano Pontifice in quolibet negotio laturus
sententiam. Sed esto, ponamus nunc Romae esse Damasum, quid contra ejus
decretum actum est? Nempe, fi been recordor, primum Capitulum suit quod
Episcoporum and summorum negotiorum Ecclesiasticorum causae semper ad sedem
Apostolicam sint referendae. Utique relatae sunt, non solum ab Episcopis, sed
etiam a Principe nostro serenissimo, liberaque potestas Apostolicae sedi data
est, and vera investigandi, and cognoscendi and di judicandi, per temporum
intervalla nimis prolixa: nec prius ad causam accessimus, quam desperatione
judicii ejus (by way of advice, rather then final censure) protraheremur.
Consultus est ergo Romanus Episcopus ut oportuit, and de hujus Arnulsi
depositione, and de ejus qui domui Dei digne praeesse posset substitutione; sed
our nihil responderit, quorum interest ipsi viderint. Nos autem Sardicense
Concilium, quod privilegio Romanae Ecclesiae plurimum favet, ita ad hanc causam
inflectimus, ut quod de solo Episcopo in qualibet provincia relicto dicit, ad
Romanum Episcopum affectum esse credamus, etc.

dicitis. Tum Comes Brochardus (the Nobles as well as Bishops being present in
this Synod) demanded, Quid est istud, Sicut dicitis? palam cloquatur, palam
confiteatur, ne postea Episcopos crimina, quae voluerint finxisse dictitet, se
confessum esse abneget. Whereupon he answered, Palam dico and profiteor me

Writing under his hand, confessed his crime and abuse of his Pontifical Office
and Ministry, whereof he acknowledged himself unworthy, desiring that another
Archbishop, qui digne praesse and prodesse possit Ecclesiae, might be
consecrated in his place. Arnulfus being thereupon deposed and committed to
prison in the City of Aurelia, Gerbertus (afterward Pope) was made Archbishop
in his place; and Siguinus Senonensis Archiepiscopus (who would not consent to
Arnulfus his deposition, quae magis ipsius aulae insatiabili odio, quam
Episcoporum sententia fiebat, as he conceived) una cum Arnulfo in carcerem ire
jubetur: qua quidem re Hugo Rex suae tranquillitati consulere studebat: ac

intrusion of Arnulfus, the justice of his deposition, and legality of his own
advancement to it) deposed, or rather translated from thence to the Bishopric
of Ravenna, to give satisfaction to the King and him, ex qua veluti scala
postea in Romanum Episcopatum emergit.

1. Epistle, Anno 998.
Othoni Caesari, has these expressions: Loquatur Dominus men's servo suo
propriis Epistolis soli^o more, ut ejus servitutis fiat exhibitio, etc. Quantum
enim in nobis est, quod possibile este esse, consequens est nos perficere, si
vestrum cognoverimus velle. Non dicatur Majestatis reus, cui pro Caesare stare
semper fuit gloria, contra Caesarem ignominia. Epistola 154. Domino and
glorioso Othoni Imperatori semper Augusto; Gerbertus gratia Domini Remorum
Episcopus, quicquid tanto Imperatori dignum, etc. Paremus ergo Caesar,
Imperialibus edictis, tum in hoc, tum in omnibus quaecunque divina Majestas
vestra decreverit. Non enim deesse possumus obsequio, qui nihil inter humanas
res dulcius aspicimus vestro Imperio. Epist. 34. he has the like passages.
Epist. 12. he thus complains: Ipse Caesar omnium hominum excellentissimus, a
furciferis asino coaequatur. O amicorum fidelissime; recordare quod te
oraverim, me malle esse nulitem in Caesarianis castris, quam Regem in
extraneis. And in his Philip. Morney, Historia Papatus, p. 22^, 223.
Epistola ad Wilderodonem Episcopum Argentinensem, he thus asserts the Rights
of the Kings and Church of France, against the Popes Usurpations. Tu dicis
Arunlphum incendia, seditiones, traditiones, flagitia, captivitates, suorumque
direptiones exercentem, suorum Regum interritus molientem, Patriam hostibus
prodentem, divina humanaque contemnentem, nec communione debuisse privari, nec
potestate Principis abjici, Romans 13.
sine Episcopi Romani jussione; cum Apostolus dicat: Quia Princeps non sine
causa gladium portat, sed ad vindictam malefactorum, laudem vero bonorum.
Favete omnes, qui Regibus vestris fidem promisistis, promissamque servare
vultis, qui Clerum vobis commissum and populum nec tradidistis, nec tradere
disponitis; vos inquam, qui tantorum scelerum facta perhorrescitis, favete his
qui obediunt Deo jubenti. Mat. 18.
Peccantem and Ecclesiae non obaudientem habendum sicut Ethnicum and
Publicanum: qui iterum dicit vobis; Vae vobis Scribae and Pharisaei qui
transgredimini mandatum Dei, etc. Et ne quis nos in invidiam adducat, quasi
privilegiis Romanae Ecclesiae derogantes, audiat Hieronymum dicentem. Si
authoritas quaeritur, orbis major est Urbe: Quod si persona major Presbytero
quaeritur, ille Sacerdos magnus Leo Papa accedat; Non tenetur, inquit, Petri
privilegium, ubi non ex ejus aequitate fertur judicium, etc. At quid judicata,
si judicanda exinde non informantur? aut quomodo mansuras in aeternum leges
trecenti december and octo Patres constituerunt, si horum constituta ad unius
libitum permutantur, aut perimuutur? Apiarius Presbyter ab Afris damnatus, a
Romany communioni restitutus est. Scribunt Africani Papae Coelestino, contra
Nycaenam Synodum factum videri. Aiunt Calumniatores nostri, Summum Sacerdotem
Arnulphum a Summo Sacerdote Romano debuisse tantum dijudicari; ait Beatus
Augustinus, si Caecilianum totius Africae primatem ejus accusatores, quod in
vita non potuerunt, post mortem convincant, a sacrorum proditoribus voluminum
ordinatum, vel ipsum proditorem fuisse, and post mortem sine r^tractatione se
ei Anathema dicturum. Licuit ergo Episcopis Galliarum viventi Arnulpho confesso
and convicto, ut Ethnico and Publicano dixisse Anathema; licuit inquam, sequi
Evangelistas, Apostolos, Prophetas, sacra Concilia, vivorum Apostolorum
decreta, ab his quatuor non discordantia, semper in usu habita, semper habenda,
etc. Pressa jacet Tyrannide omnis Ecclesia Gallorum, atqui non a Gallis, sed ab
his a quibus sperebatur salus. Sed una salus hominis o Christ tu es; Ipsa Roma
omnium Ecclesiarum hactenus habita matter, malis benedicere, bonis maledicere
fertur, et quibus nec ave dicendum est, communicare, tuamque legem zelantes
damnare, abutens ligandi et solvendi potestate a te accepta. So little did this
Archbishop (soon after made Pope) esteem the pretended Supremacy of the Pope,
or See of Rome.

jubet, commanded the Romans to choose Bruno his kinsman, son of Otto Duke of
Suevia, Pope; sperans ista ratione posse pacem stabilire, quae electionibus
Novorum Pontificum semper solebat perturbari. Hereupon, Clerus and populus sibi
ab Imperatore metuentes, Brunonem in Pontificem eligunt, (called Gregory the
5.) a quo Otto cum benedictionem, tum Coronam Imperii accepit: Ottone ad
Germaniam regresso, Romanus populus, novarum rerum cupidus, Crescentium ad
consularem potestatem trabunt, and res Romanas ejus fidei atque industriae
committunt. Crescentius and populus aegre ferentes Gregorium, Germanum natione,
Auctoritate Imperatoris creatum Pontificem, ideo illum sede Pontificia
ejiciunt, and Johannem 18. natione Graecum, Placentinum Episcopum (hominem
perniciosum, insatiabili mentis ardore Papatum muneribus, tumultu ac seditione,
aliorum Pontificum more, ambientem) Pontificem creant; qui per factionem
pecuniis corruptam sedem occupavit, quod illi exitium, divina ultione, horridum
postea peperit. Gregorius, ad Imperatorem se conferens, de injuria queritur.
Imperator indigne ferens hanc contumeliam, cum exercitu in Italiam redit; Urbem
obsedit, oppugnavit impigre: Hereupon the Romans deserting Crescentius and Pope
John, veniam ab Imperatore sibi dari petunt, aperiuntque Germanis portas: The
Pope and Crescentius thereupon fled to the strong Castle of St. Angelo, where
after some assaults, descendunt ad Imperatorem veniam petituri; in itinere
intercipiuntur. Johannes Novus Pontifex, effossis prius oculis, (auribus quoque
and naribus abscissis, as Damianus and others write) Pontificatu simul et vita
privabatur. On this Pope John and his followers Calamitatum lib. 3.
Baptista Mantuanus bestowed these verses.

Pernices mercantur equos; venalia Romae,
Templa, Sacerdotes, Altaria Sacra, Coronae,
Ignes, Thura, Preces, Coelum est venale, Deusque.
Miror ego (inquit Platina) Historicos Johannem istum inter Pontifices
numerasse, cum vivente adhuc Gregorio, sedem occupasset, nisi forte in
conscribendis Pontificum vitis, ita faciendum censeant, ut in perpetua Historia
fit. Nam and Tyrannorum perversa facta, optimorum Pricipum rebus gestis
annumerantur; ut quantum inter se boni and mali dissident a legentibus agnosci
possit; quo malorum exemplo a vitiis deterreantur, and bonorum exemplo al
virtutes impulsi, vitam in terris beatam ducant. Qua quidem beatitudine
Johannes iste caruit, Fur certe in Pontificatu et latro. Flores Temporum, and
Aventinus relate, that this Pope John, de Capitolio praecipitatus sit, indeque
esse, ut nulli Pontifici invisere liceat. Crescentius (his Patron and advancer)
vili jumento imponebatur, and vultu ad caudam verso, nasoque cum auribus
abscisso, ut spectaculo esset omnibus, per plateas circumducebatur, ac
truncatis membris, ante Vribis moenia patibulo suspendebatur: This Emperor,
Gregorium 5. in pristinam Pontificum sedem restituit: an unanswerable evidence
of his Sovereign Jurisdiction, both over the Pope, City and Citizens of Rome,
in relation to the election and confirmation of the Roman Pontiff. After which,
Congregata Romae Synodo, the Emperor and Pope perceiving the various
contentions and events concerning the Emperors election, arising from the
ambition of Princes, and Episcoporum philargyria, they ordained in this Synod,
ut jus eligendi Caesares apud Germaniae Principes deinde maneret; scilicet,
Maguntinensem, Treverensem, and Coloniensem Archiepiscopos, Comitem Palatinum
Rheni, Ducem Saxoniae, ac Marchionem Brandeburgensem, and Bohemiae Principem ad
dirimendas discordias in paribus suffragiis. Quam sanctionem Anno Dom. 1002.
Otto Imperator approbavit, without which it had been a mere nullity. Which
Constitution the Kings of France, iniquissime ferebant, sed aper to bello id
illis eripere non audebant.

(alias Gerbertus) Archbishop of Ravenna, (of whom before) per Otthonem
Imperatorem ad Romanae urbis sedem evehitur, and named Sylvester the 2d. This
Pope, artibus Diabolicis intentus, totus se Satanae mancipabat, and jurejurando
se tradidit from his youth, obtaining all his former preferments, and the
Papacy, magicis artibus, and strenua opera Diaboli adjutus. Which he concealing
after he was made Pope (lest he should seem the Devils Vicar, rather then
Christ's) Aeneum vero caput domi in abdito quodam loco servabat, per quod
Diabolus de rebus futuris an ipso rogatus, responsa dabat. Sylvester in tanto
honorum gradu Diaboli open constitutus, consuluit aliquando Diabolum de tantae
foelicitatis suae dinturnitate: qui ressondit, Non eum moriturum, nisi
Hierosolymas missam celebraret. Pontifex urbem Palestinae intelligens,
longissime mortem a se abesse somniabat, cumnihil minus quam de Hierosolyma
adcunda cogitaret: Impiam igitur and ab omni ^mendations cura, liberam agebat
vitam. But soon after saying Mass in Lent, according to the custom of former
Popes, in the Church of St. Cross, called ^rusalem, in ipsis sacris ardenti
febre corripitur, daemonumque audit strepitum; whereupon conceiving himself
deluded by the Devils ambiguous answer, and that his death approached,
Conscientiae morsu saevissimo excitatus, scelus suum deploravit, and
praesentibus Cardinalibus rem omnem multo cum gemitu aperuit. Membra omnia
quibus Diabolo obsequium praestiterat (viz. manus and linguam, sunt, qui
addunt, genitalia) praecidi jussit: Deinde truncum mortuum super bigam jussit
poni, at ubicunque animalia perducerent and subsisterent sepeliretur; And then
expiring (Anno Dom. 1001. as some, or 1003. as others compute) the Cardinals
executed what he desired on his corpse. Et quis non hinc intelligat (writes
Balaeus) qualenam istud munus sit, qualis sit dignitas, quale officium, quod
Diabolus sine censura novit, quodque Satanicis atque nefariis artibus adepisci
possunt homines perditissimi? Quale sit etiam Missae sacrificum, quod vivis and
mortuis prodesse crebro jactitant, cum Diabolus tantam tragoe^iam adversus
sanctissimum Petri successorem and socium (Simonem Magum, potius) sub eo
excitaverit, atque ad lacum tartareum secum tandem traxerit.

Before I proceed further, I cannot but take notice of a memorable passage of
Cardinal Annalium Eccl. Tom. 1^. Anno 912. Artic. 8. Phil: Morney Hist Papatus,
p. 123.
Baronius (a chief Assertor of the universal Supremacy, and uninterrupted
Succession of the Popes and Church of Rome) touching the corrupt, detestable
state of the Church and Bishops of Rome, in this age. Quae tunc facies
Ecclesiae Romanae? quam foedissima, cum Romae dominarentur potentissimae aeque
ac sordidissimae Meretrices? Quarum arbitrio mutarentur seeds, darentur
Episcopi, and quod auditu horrendum and infandum est, intruderentur in sedem
Petri eorum amasii, et Pseudo-Pontifices, qui non sunt nisi ad consignanda
tanta tempora in Catalogo Romanorum Pontificum scripti. Quis enim a Scortis
hujusmodi intrusos, sine lege, legitimos dicere posset, Romanos fuisse
Pontifices? Nusquam Cleri eligentis, vel consentientis postea, aliqua mentio,
Canones pressi silentio, decreta Pontificum suffocata, proscriptae antiquae
traditiones veteresque in eligendo Summo Pontifice consuetudines, sacr^que
ritus and pristinus usus, prorsus extincti. Sic vendicaverat omnia sibi libido
seculari potentia freta, insaniens, aestro percita dominandi. Dormiebat tunc
plane alto (ut apparet) sopore Christus in Navi, cum ipse flantibus validis
ventis, navis ipsa fluctibus operiretur. Dormiebat, inquam, qui ista non videre
dissimulans, sineret sic fieri, dum non exurgeret vindex. Et quod deterius
videtur, deerant qui Dominum sic dormientem clamoribus excitarent discipuli,
stertentibus omnibus. Qualesnam reris delectos ab hisce monstris Presbyteros
and Diaconos Cardinales fuisse putandum, cum nihil tam naturae insitum sit,
quam unumquemque sibi similem generare? Quos in omnibus his, a quibus delecti
fuerint, consensisse dubitare quis poterit? imitatosque esse ipsos, sectatosque
eorum vestigia quis non facile credat, and optasse hos omnes Dominum dormisse
semper, and nunquam in judicium surrecturum, evigilaturum, nunquam ad ipsorum
cognoscenda and punienda facinora quis non intelligat? On which passage, Philip
Lord Morney has this observation. Et ex hoc solo loco judicet Lector, quam
tantopere ostentavit Episcoporum Romanorum successionem, (he might add, his
Supremacy, Headship over the Church, as Christ's Vicar General) quo jure
defendere possit? To which I shall subjoyn this observation of learned
Rodolphus Gualtherus Hom. l. 3. de Antichristo, Balaeus in Viti^ Pontif. l. 4.
p. 174.
Gualther, relating to the successive Popes in the same age. Jam ergo penes
cordatum quemvis judicium esto, non merito de Pontificum tyrannide and
iniquitate conquesti sint optimi quique, cum tot (quos modo commemoravimus)
nebulones, tyrannos, fures, raptores, latrones, seditiosos, adulteros, et palam
sacrilegos (he might have added homicidas, apostatas, Necromanticos,
haereticos, idololatricos, atheisticos) intra tam paucos annos, seeds illa
gestaverit. Et quis sodes ceu sanctam veneretur, quae tor pestes sustinere
potuit? Nondum tamen impletus satis fuit impiissimorum hominum catalogus, etc.
To these I could subjoyn the concurrent Testimonies of Platina, Sabellicus,
Wernerus, St. Bernard, Genebrardus, Bellarmin, and others, collected by our
incomparable Iacobus Usserius, in his Book, De Christianarum Ecclesiarum
Successione and statu, c. 2, 3, 4. to which I refer the Reader: concluding with
this memorable passage of Enead. 9. l. 1. and 2.
Ant. Coccius Sabellicus, evidencing the Emperors Supremacy over Popes: Non
possum non multum mirar^, unde Tragica haec Pontificum fluxerint exempla, quam
dira pretatis oblivio eorum mentes irrepserit, ut neque personae quem
sustinebant ratio ab his ulla haberetur, neque loci quem tenerent, ut non
immerito aliquis suspicaretur, quicquid moderaminis fuit et Majestatis in
illis, qui^a Caroli cognomento Magni temporibus ad Gallici Imperii exitum
interfuit (interfuit enim aetas una) sedem tenuerunt, non tam sua sponte, quam
Regum, Imperatorum, et in quorum tutela essent metu et reverentia, in officio
manserunt. Wherefore it was very necessary, at least expedient for the good
government, reformation of Popes, Prelates, and the Church of God, that
Christian Kings and Emperors should have a Superintendent coercive power over
them, to keep them all in good order, to restrain, correct their detestable
Enormities and exorbitances; especially since Wernerus (a Carthu^^an Monk)
writing of this degenerate age, and Popes therein, pronounces, Sanctitatem
Papam dimisisse, ac ad Imperatores accessisse hoc tempore, sicut Clare apparet;
and Chronograph. l. 4. in principio, 10. seculi.
Genebrardus records, Hoc seculum uno infelix, quod per annos f^re 150.
Pontifices circiter 50. a virtute majorum prorsus defecerint, Apotactici,
Apostaticive potius, quam Apostolici: And could such Monsters of men, and
Apostates from the life and faith of Christ, be his Universal Vicars over his
Church on earth, and not rather those pious Christian Kings, Emperors, who
punished their excesses?

Romana sede; but with some contest; Certamen enim fuit (as Benno Cardinalis,
and others record) inter ipsius Sylvestri discipulos necromantes dum quisque
anhelaret ad rapiendum sibi Papatum. This Pope by the persuasion of his Clergy
Romanum populum Pontificis electione privavit, adjectis his clausulis, Docendus
(Ducendus) est populus, non sequendus: Major est dignitas legis quae regitur
Spiritu sancto (whereby these Popes were not ruled, but by the unclean Spirit
the Devil) quam legis secularis. Leges Imperatorias nihil esse dicebat: But by
a divine retalation, his Papal authority was so much slighted, that Veneno a
suis domesticis sublatus est, within 5. months after his consecration, to make
way for his successor John the 20. qui prodig iosis artibus Satanici Papatus
sellam occupavit. A praedicto enim Sylvestro, qui Magus diabolicus erat, usque
ad Gregorium septimum, sceleratissimum nebulonem, ac praestigiatorem
iniquissimum, famosi fuerunt incantatores Romani Pontifices omnes, Jannem and
Jambrem Aegyptos Magos long superantes, as Benno Cardinalis, Balaeus, and
others inform us. This Pope totum se voluptatibus dedit, during all his Papacy,
till at last by the practice of such who aspired after his Papal See, Anno 1007
non sine veneni suspitione expiravit, Anno 1009.

Earl Rodulph, a near neighbor to Fulberti Episc. Carnotensis, Epist: 22.
Bibl. Patrum, Tom. 11. p. 11. Epist. 60.
Fulbertus Bishop of Carnotum, about the year 1007. res Ecclesia Carnotensis
per injustam occasionem invasit, unum de Clericis suis manibus interfecit; duos
alios captos Sacramento illigavit. Et de his omnibus appellatus in Curia Regis,
(upon the frequent complaints of Fulbertus) and coram plena Ecclesia saepe
vocatus, nec propter hominem, nec propter Deum ad justitiam venire dignatus; he
was at last excommunicated by Fulbertus: whereupon appealing to Pope John the
20. ad limina Sancti Petri contendit, tanquam ibi possit accipere de pecca^^
absolutionem, unde venire non vult ad emendationem. Fulbertus on this occasion
writ an Epistle to Pope John, ut eum de sanguine filiorum tuorum ita arguere
and castigare memineris, sic ut meritum esse tua prudentia novit. Nec tua
sanctitas injuste in communionem recipiat, quem divina authoritas sicut
Ethnicum alienat. Unde bone pastor evigila, evigila super nos, ne per incuriam
tuam grex Domini detrimentum sustineat. Moreover, Epist. 3. Domino suo Regi R.

Gaufridus Vicecomes, building a Castle at Iseras, within the Lands of St.
Mary, belonging to his Bishopric, bestowed on him by Robert King of France, he
appealed to this King by Messengers and Letters, for advice and relief against
these injuries, to command them vestra regali auctoritate vivaciter imperando,
to redress these injuries; ne apud extraneum Regem, vel Imperatorem, quod
absit, compellamur a vobis exules, noluisse vos, vel non valuisse, Sponsam
Christi sanctam Ecclesiam vobis regere commissam, intueri: acknowledging the
chief Government of the Church, as well as protection, to belong to the King,
not Pope, within his Kingdom; and that the conferring of Epist. 68, 89, 131,
132.
Bishoprics and placing, confirming Bishops in vacant Sces, appertained to the
King (not Pope or Clergy) as sundry of his Epistles evidence.

the Romans (who sought to depose him) that he was enforced to crave the Emperor
Conrades protection (whom he crowned) to secure him: who threatened utterly to
destroy the Romans if they offered any violence to him. An evidence, that the
Emperors Power and Supremacy then exceeded the Popes, even in Rome it self.

Theophylactus, Pope John's Nephew, sedem Romanam Satanicis artibus de magicis
praestigiis obtinuit; (being called Benedict the 9th.) although he and his
accomplices before his Papacy, per nefariae curiositatis ritus atque caeremonias,
Spiritus malignos invocare solebat, and foeminas quascunque volebat
necromanticis operationibus in quibusdam nemoribus and sylvis in foedos
amplexus trahere; He trained up Hildebrand in these magical arts, tantorum
maleficiorum fidus minister, and pessimis magistrus, pejor est factus
discipulus. He was often dejected from his Papal See by the Romans for his
vices, cruelty, ignorance; Literarum enim adeo rudis erat, ut collegam qui suo
loco sacra tractaret, secum consecrare voluerit: verum pluribus id fieri
improbantibus, ab incepto destitit. Anno 1045. Sede dejectus est, and Romani
Johannem Sabinensem Episcopum in ejus locum substituerunt, Sylvestrum tertium

This Pope, Anno 1041. dispensed with Cazimere a professed Monk, right heir to
the Crown of Poland, to marry, and to be made King of Poland, upon this
condition, That the Polanders should render to him and his Successors an annual
Tribute of money, one farthing for every head, shave their heads, not suffer
their hair or beards to grow long, etc. and perpetually remember, that they
were Feudataries and Tributaries to the Roman See.

and Regi. Nam quando Rex delinquit, Soli Deo reus est Iste igitur Rex, soli Deo
peccare se dicit, quia hominem non habet qui eius facta dijudicet. Therefore
neither the High Priest, nor Pope, by his gloss upon this Text, has any power
to judge or depose Kings for their sins, much less for opposing their
usurpations, and correcting their exorbitances.

Pope Gregory the 6. having bought the Papacy of Benedict the 9th. to recruit
his Treasury, Anno 1046, 1047,
after solemn admonition, excommunicated, and that not prevailing, made War
upon, and sent unto all those who robbed pilgrims or strangers, and took away
their oblations by force, slaying and robbing them even in the very Churches of
Rome, as our Malmesbury and others relate, by which means he not only restored,
but exceedingly augmented the goods of the Church; whereupon the Cardinals
styled him a Symoniack, a Manslayer, a thirster after blood, and unworthy
Christian burial. Yea Historiae l. 5. c. 5, 6.
Radulphus Glaber, a Monk of Clungy, living in that age, records, that Henry
the 2. calling the Archbishops and Bishops of his Dominions together,
complained thus of the universal corruption in the Clergy. Omnes gradus
Ecclesiastici a maximo Pontifice usque ad Ostiarium opprimuntur per suae
damnationis pretium, ac juxta vocem Dominicam, in cunctis grassatur spirituale
latrocinium: Glaber subjoyns, Et haec non solum in Gallicanis Episcopis,
pullulaverat nequitia pessima, sed totam occupaverat Italiam: omnia quippe
Ministeria Ecclesiastica eo tempore ita habebantur venalia, quasi in foro
secularia mercimonia. Ipso tempore Romana seeds quae universalis jure habetur
in orb terrarum, praefato morbo pestifero, per viginti quinque annorum spatia
miserrime l^boraverat; fuerat enim eidem sedi ordinatus quidam puer circiter
annorum duodecim, contra jus fasque, quem scilicet sola pecunia auri et argenti
plus commendavit, quam aetas and sanctitas. Et quoniam infelicem habuit
introitum, infeliciorem persersit exitum: suitable, turpitudini illius
conversationis and vitae. Glabot. l. 4. c. 7.
Tunc, tum in saeculari potestate, tum etiam in Ecclesiastica Religione totius
regiminis personae constiterant, in puerili aetate, propter peccata enim populi
contigit tunc illud Salomonicum, quod ait, Vae tibi terrae. Nam and ipse
universalis Papa Romanus, nepos scilicet duorum, Benedicti atque Johannis, qui
ei praecesserant, puer ferme decennis intercedente Thesaurorum pecunia electus
extitit a Romany, a quibus exinde frequenter ejectus, ac inhoneste receptus,
nulla potestate viguit. Et ut jam superius taxavimus, caeteros tunc temporis

William Archbishop of Tyrus made this just complaint of the general Apostasy
and corruptions in all professors of Christianity in that age, occasioned by
the evil examples, vicious and Athestical lives of Popes, Bishops, and
Clergymen, which drew down Gods judgments on them in most places: In occidente
and in omni pene orb terrarum, minime inter eos qui fideles dicebantur, fides
defecerat, and Domini timor erat de medio sublatus: perierat de rebus justitia,
and aequitate subacta violentia dominabatur in populis. Fraus, dolus and
circumventio late involaverant universa. Virtus omnis locum dederat, and
cesserat quasi inutilis, malitia subintrante. Videbatur sane mundus declinasse
ad vesperam, and filii hominis adventus secundus fore vicinior. Nam multorum
refrixerat charitas, and fides non inveniebatur super terram. Confusis
ordinibus cuncta ferebantur, and in Chaos pristinum mundus videbatur redire
velle. Fornicationum genus quodlibet, quasi res licita, passim and sine rubore
exercebatur impune. Sed nec inter affines aut propinquos tuta erant
Matrimoniorum federa. Amica coelestibus and Deo placens, quasi res vilis, jussa
migrare erat continentia. Nec parsimoniae aut sobrietati locus erat, ubi luxus
and ebrietas, and pernox alea praeoccupaverant additus, atque atria
possidebant. Nec Clerus a populo vita nobiliore differebat, sed sicut in Hos.

Episcopi, aegligentes facti erant: Canes muti, non valentes latrare, etc. Quid
plura? ut in summa dicatur, omne in praecipiti vitium stetit, and omnis caro
corruperat viam suam. Nec pronos ad malum revocare poterant Domini comminantis

Leo Cardinalis Ostensis, relating the schisms and tumults occasioned by these
three Popes at Rome, adds, that Henry the Emperor, his de sede Romana and
Apostolica nefanda auditis, coelitus inspiratus. Anno 1047. Italiam petens
adiit Romam, cupiensque sedem Apostolicam hujusmodi pugare maculus, Sutrii
restitit, and super tali tantoque negotio deliberaturus, universale ibi
Episcoporum Concilium fieri statuit. Igitur ad ejus Imperium (not the Popes)
illic Episcoporum, Abbatum, Religiosorumque virorum grandi multitudine, Romanum
quoque Pontificem, qui praeesset Concilio, invitat. Quid multa? Concilio
habito, Synodicis Canonibus atque sententiis Gregorius Symoniacus probatus,
sponte sua sede desiliens, Pontificalibus se infulis exuit, and humi prostratus
(at the Emperors feet) temeratae dignitatis veniam sibi humiliter petiit.

grown usual at Rome; But this ambitious intruder Damasus, without the Emperors

After the death of Damasus, the Romans being much vexed by Pope Benedict the
9th. formerly deposed and banished by the Emperor, who returning to Rome, ad
pristinam dignitatem perfas nefasque aspirabat; thereupon, Romani (pertaesi
seditionum quas excitaverant Papatus invasores) consilio Cardinalium, legatos
ad ipsum Imperatorem dirigunt, et ut aliquem in Papam eligendum Romam mittat
exposcunt, as some; or, ut Pontificem ipsis daret, as others express it:
Alterna invidia magis, quam honor Regio moti, as Crantzius observes. The
Emperor thereupon Brunonem Tullensem Episcopum (invitum and coactum) Romam
mittit, simplicem ingenio virum; cum inter Episcopos Germaniae non esset qui
veneficiis Romany praefici vellet: Who traveling toward Rome in his
Pontifical habit; Abbatem Cluniacensem, and Hildebrandum Monachum (Sacerdotium
and Regnum sub specie religionis eversurum, ac juramentum Imperatori praestitum
non diu servaturum, multarumque calamitatum authorem) in itinere obvios habuit.
Qui videntes eum Pontificiis ornatum insigniis, apostaseos crimen illi odiose
impingebant. Persuadebant ergo illi, ut deposito habitu Pontificio, Romam
consueto cultu peteret; dicentes, Imperatori non esse concessum ius eligendi
Papam (egregie mentita est sibi iniquitas, adds Balaeus) sed Clero and Romano
populo, tam been memores juramenti sui boni patres erant. Bruno admonentibus
morem gessit, deposito Pontificio apparatu privatus urbem ingreditur, seipsum
accusans (Hildebrando persuasore) quod Imperatori maluerit quam Deo
obtemperari. Hereupon, Romanus Clerus eundem Brunonem, (some style him
Barronem) in Pontificem eligunt, and eo libentius, quod omnem authoritatem
eligendorum Pontificum ab Imperatore (ut par erat, writes Platina) ad Clerum
transtulisset, non ad Caesarem, and propterea Leonem 9. illum appellabant, cum
merus esset Asinus, as Balaeus brands him. Hildebrandum ipsum statim sanctae
Romanae Ecclesiae Diaconum Cardinalem creat, ac Pontificii muneris consortem,
committens ei curam Ecclesiae Sancti Petri.

This Surius Council. Tom. 3. p. 577, to 597.
Pope Leo the 9. writ a large Epistle, Michaeli Constantinopolitano and Leoni
Acridano Episcopis, adversus eorum inauditas praesumptiones; for denying the
Supremacy of the Bishop of Rome, and stiling Michael, Universal Bishop and
Patriarch, in derogation of his Papal Supremacy; which this Pope endeavors to
vindicate by misapplied Scriptures, and the Emperor Constantines forged
Donation, (therein recited at large, and in Gratian Distinct. 96.) giving Pope
Sylvester therein, a superiority over all the other 4. Sees of Alexandria,
Antioch, Jerusalem, and Constantinople, ac etiam super omnes universo orb
terrarum Dei Ecclesias; granting him his Royal Palace of Rome; quod omnibus in
toto orb terrarum praefertur atque prae^ellit Palatiis. Deind^ Diadema,
videlicet Coronam capitis nostri, deinde Phrygium, id est mitram, with all his
Imperial robes; and Decreeing, That Pope Sylvester, and all his Successors.
Diademate (quod ex capite nostro illi concessimus) ex auro purissimo and gemmis
preciosis, uti debeant, and in capite ad laudem Dei pro honor beati Petri
gestare. Which forged Donation (at large refuted by In his Defense of
Constantine, and Treatise of the Popes Temporal Monarchy, (the learnedest of
this kin^ and subject) London 162^.
Dr. Crakenthorp and sundry others) if admitted true, infallibly evidenceth all
the Popes Temporal and Ecclesiastical pretended Supremacy, Dominion, State, to
be derived from this Emperor, not from Christ, or St. Peter, and that it was
originally vested in the Emperor and his Successors by Christ himself, else his
grant thereof to Pope Sylvester and his successors, was but a mere nullity:
since, Nemo potest dare, quod non habet.

Besides, this Pope writ an Surius Council. Tom 3 p. 596, 597
Epistle, Glorioso and Religioso Imperatori Constantino Monomacho, beginning
thus: Quantas gratias refer jugiter debeamus creatrici, and gubernatrici
omnium sanctae and individuae Trinitati, 1 Cor. 4.
super inenarrabili dono ejus, Ephesians. 1.
quo operatur omnia in omnibus, etiam ex tua devotione et religiosa industria,
gloriosissime Fili atque Serenissime Imperator, perpendere possumus quare talem
nostris exhibuit, et grata pietate providit diebus, cujus fida open statum
Sanctae et Catholicae Ecclesiae relevari, et terreni Imperii rempublicam
meliorari confidamus. Tu enim post nimium longas et perniciosas discordias,
primus pacis et concordiae monitor, portitor, et exoptatus exactor efficeris;
and cum ipso vase electionis humillimo Paulo dicere videris: 2 Cor. 5.
Pro Christo legatione fungentes, tanquam Deo exhortante per nos, obsecramus,
reconciliamini propter eum, qui est Ephesians. 2.
pax nostra, qui facit utraque unum, etc. After which asserting the Headship
and Supremacy of the Church of Rome above other Churches, upon false
principles, he subjoynes; Cujus venerabilem faciem tu quoque honorificare
disponis, non ingratus illi, quae tuum verticem diademate terreni Principatus
decenter insignivit, and tremendum and amandum populis effecit, and ut in
sempiternum regnes, Chrismate adoptionis inunxit. Nempe ipsa antiqua and jam
emerita Roma illum primum nobilissimum and religiosissimum Constantinum, cujus
genealogia gloriaris and potentia magnificaris, cujusque de nomine dictam urbem
famosam regis, temporaliter edidit, nutrivit, provexit, and super omnes
mortales constituit, nec a beneficiis cessavit, donec eundem aeterni regni
gloria cumulavit. Unde multimoda gratiarum action tuam excellentiam
gloriosissime fili, magnificando, tanto majori super tua devotione, and
recognitione replemur gaudio, quanto copiosior animarum numerus ex tuo regimine
pendet; (therefore by this Popes confession, this Emperor had the chief
regiment and care of his Subjects souls) tuoque innititur exemplo. Et ideo non
cessamus orare communem Dominum, Prove. 8.
per quem Regis regnant, and Principes justa decernunt, ut in suo beneplacito

Vae mihi est, si non evangelizavero: necessitas enim mihi incumbit maxima,
posituro rationem aeterno and districto judici propter unius regimen Ecclesiae
ex omnium Ecclesiarum merito, etc. After which expressing his endeavors for
the Churches peace, he thus proceeds, Ad quam acquirendam and obtinendam
habemus maximum ex divina pretate solatium, and praesidium Charissimum, atque
clarissimum filium nostrum Imperatorem Henricum, cujus de die in diem
expectamus promissum et proximum adventum, utpote cum procinctu, and
expeditione Imperiali properantis ad nostrum subsidium. Ad quod etiam superna
gratia tuam Serenitatem animavit, ut hinc inde vobis duobus velut totidem
brachiis inimicam gentem ab Ecclesia Christi propellentibus et procul
effugantibus, afflictae nunc Christianitatis relevetur decus, and Reipublicae
reformetur status. Et quia abundante iniquitate and refrigescente charitate,
Mat. 24.
Sancta Romana Ecclesia and Apostolica seeds nimium diu obsessa fuit
mercenariis et non Pastoribus, a quibus sua, non quae sunt Christi,
quaerentibus, devastata jacebat miserabiliter hactenus, divinum consilium
voluit meam humilitatem suscipere tantae Cathedrae pondus. Quo licet plurimum
mei imbecilles praegraventur and deprimantur humeri, non parvum nihi subest
sanctae spei, quandoquidem ex utroque latere tales adstant Filii, religione et
potentia praeclarissimi. Quapropter devotissime fili, and Serenissime
Imperator, collaborare nobis dignare ad relevationem tuae Matris Sanctae
Ecclesiae, et privilegia dignitatis atque reverentiae ejus, necnon patrimonia
re cuperanda in tuae ditionis partibus, sicut manifest cognoscere poteris ex
venerabilium praedecessorum nostrorum, seu tuorum scriptis and gestis. Tu ergo
magnus successor Magni Constantini, sanguine, nomine et imperio factus, ut fias
etiam imitator devotionis ejus erga Apostolicam sedem, exhortamur, et quae ille
mirabilis vir post Christum eidem sedi contulit, et confirmavit, et defendit,
tu juxta tui nominis etymologiam constanter adjuva recuperare, retinere, et
defendere. Ita enim apud Deum singulariter pugnans cognominaberis, quod
jamdudum inter homines cognominaris. Alludit ad cognomen Monomachus.
Hoc sane gloriosissimus filius noster Henricus perficere molitur in suis
partibus. Quae omnia nobis and vobis provenient felicius and multiplicius, ubi
quantocyus Dei gratia praeveniente, and beatissimis Apostolorum principibus
intervenientibus, and me qualicunque Vicario eorum mediante and obtinente,
firmissimum pacis and amicitiae inter vos ambos componetur foedus, etc. He
concludes his Epistle to him with these words, and this prayer for him.
Benedictus Deus, and Pater Domini nostri Jesu Christi, 2 Cor. 1.
Pater misericordiarum, and Deus totius consolationis, dignetur tuam
excellentiam benedicere omni benedictione spirituali, repleatque omni gaudio et
pace, ut in praesenti seculo per longa tempora feliciter domineris, and in
futuro sine fine cum Rege Regum, and Domino Dominantium regno coelorum beat
perfruaris, honorabilis, and desiderabilis nobis in Christo fili and gloriose
Auguste, Amen. These Passages are a sufficient evidence: 1. That in this age

predecessor and others before had done) Leonis Epist. 1. c. 9. Surius Council.

refusing by any means to renounce this Title, or acknowledge the Popes and
Roman Churches supremacy. 2ly. That the chief care, protection, government of
the Church of God, the restitution, preservation of its peace, by suppressing
Schisms, discords, schismatics, heretics, and the open Enemies thereof, and
invaders of its privileges, possessions, belonged to Christian Kings and
Emperors, by this Popes own confession, who claimed his power, possessions,
from their Donations, and implored their assistance upon all occasions.

former and late oaths and allegiance to the Emperor. This Pope reduced the
Church of Millain under the obedience of the Sea of Rome, from which it had
been exempted above 200 years. Per Hildebrandum, cujus operautebatur plurimum,
passim per Italiam and Burgundiam Ecclesias Symoniaca haeresi infestas,
purgavit: (Sic enim appellabant asini indocti si quis Ecclesias^icum beneficium
a Laico and non ab ipsis acciperet) and Henricum Imperatorem, ejusdem criminis
reum, quo plurimum Romanorum Pontificum auctoritati derogaretur, damnavit; if
Platina deserve credit therein. This Pope holding a Synod at Florence against
this pretended Simony, Pluralities, and Priests wives, Brazuh pharmaco,
Hildebrandi impulsu, tactus occubuit, Anno 1058. Whereupon Hildebrand posting
to Rome, Omnes Clericos adesse jussit, praesentesque Sacramento adegit, ne
quenquam patiantur in Pontificem eligi, nisi sit ille omnium, adeoque suo etiam
consensu, designatus Pontifex. But the Romans mutinying against the Clergy, who
endeavored to deprive them of their Votes in the Popes election: Benedictus
10. Pontifex acclamatur, and clamore populari Pontifex habebatur, during
Hildebrands absence at Florence: who posting to Rome, expostulated with the
Cardinals for suffering a Pope to be intruded on them against their Oath,
persuading them to elect Gerardus in his place: But fearing and not daring to
elect a New Pope at Rome, ob plebis furorem; Senas simul profugiunt, ibique rem
perficiunt; Gerardus being there elected Pope, assumed the name of Nicholaus
secundus: This new Pope and his accomplices, Sutrii pergens constitit, coactoque
Concilie Benedictum Pontificatu exit, qui factiosis ultro cedens, Anno 1059,
1060.
returned to Veltras his former Bishopric by his Successors consent. After
which he held a 2d. Synod in Rome, wherein these Decrees were made concerning
the future election of Popes, to secure his own Title against Pope Stephen
Surius Council. Tom. 3. p. 599, 600. Centur. Magd. 11. c. 9.
si quis pecunia, vel gratia humana, aut populari, militarive tumultu, sine
concordi and canonica electione Cardinalium, fuerit in throno Petri collocatus,
is non Apostolicus, sed Apostaticus, id est, a ratione deficiens, merito
vocetur: liceatque Cardinalibus, Clericis et Laicis Deum colentibus, illum ut
praedonem anathematizare, et quovis humano auxilio a sede Apostolica
propellere, atque quovis in loco, si in Vrbe non liceat, Catholicos hujusce rei
causa congregare. This Decree, if Apostolical, Orthodox, made this Pope
himself, all his Predecessors, and most of his Successors in the Roman See both
Robbers and Apostates; and laid a seditious, schismatical ground for all
Christians to rise up tumultuously against most succeeding Pontifs as such,
Moreover, Inspector Deo est statutum, ut Electio Romani Pontificis in potestate
Cardinalium Episcoporum sit; ita ut si quis Apostolicae sedis sine praemissa
concordi and canonica electione eorum, ac deinde sequentium ordinum
Religiosorum Clericorum and Laicorum consensu inthronizatur, is, non Papa vel
Apostolicus, sed Apostaticus habeatur. This Decree confines the Popes Election
only to the Cardinal Bishops, but yet requires the subsequent assent of the
inferior Clergy and people to his inthronization. After which they proceeded
to take away all Emperors, Kings, Nobles, and Laymens Rights of Patronage and
presentations to any Church or Benefice, either with, or without reward. Ut per
Laicos nullo modo quilibet Clericus aut Presbyter obtineat Ecclesiam, nec
gratis, nec precio. And to make this bitter pill to be swallowed with less
regret, they subjoyned this plausible Decree thereto against Pluralities, Nec
aliquis Presbyter duas Ecclesias simul obtineat: not with intention
conscientiously to observe it, but to raise moneys by dispensing with it: Next
they decreed, Ut cujuslibet ordinis Clericos Laici non judicent, nec de
Ecclesi^s ejiciant, to exempt all Clerks from Secular Jurisdiction, though
never so criminal, vicious, or indirectly intruded into Churches by the Pope or
other Prelates. Ut nullus Laicus ad quemlibet gradum Ecclesiasticum repent
promoveatur, nisi post mutatum habitum secularem, diuturna conversatione inter
Clericos fuerit comprobatus; Though many of their Popes were mere Laymen when
first elected; Yea one of them, Pope Joan (alias John the 8.) a woman, a most
notorious Whore not a man, so long conversant with Clergymen under the disguise

Laurentius Surius gives us this further account of Pope Nicholas the 2d. his
Decree against Symoniacks, and several resolutions relating thereunto: Dominus
Papa Nicholaus Synodo in Basilica Constantiniana praesidens dixit; Erga
Simoniacos nullam misericordiam in dignitate servanda habendam esse,
decernimus, sed juxta Caenonum sanctiones, and decreta Sanctorum Patrum, eos
omnino damnamus ac deponendos esse Apostolica authoritate sancimus. De iis
autem qui non per pecuniam, sed gratis sunt a SIMONIACIS ordinati, quae
quaestio a longo tempore est diutius ventilata, omnem modum dubietatis
absolvimus, it a ut super hoc Capitulo nominem deinceps ambigere permittamus.
Quia igitur usque adeo haec venenata pernicies hactenus inolevit, ut vix
quaelibet Ecclesia valeat reperiri quae hoc morbo non sit aliqua ex part
corrupta, eosque usque modo gratis sunt a Simoniacis consecrati, non tam
censura justitiae quam misericordiae intuitu in acceptis ordinibus manner
permittimus: nisi forte alia culpa ex vita eorum contra canones eis existat.
Tanta quippe talium multitudo est, ut dum rigorem Canonici vigoris super eos
servare non possumus, necesse sit, ut dispensatorie ad piae condescentionis
studium nostros animos ad praesens inclinemus. Ita tamen authoritate Sanctorum
Apostolorum Petri and Pauli omnimodis interdicimus, ne aliquando aliquis
Successorum nostrorum, ex hac nostra permissione regulam sibi vel alicui
assumat vel praefigat: quia hoc non authoritas antiquorum Patrum jubendo aut
concedendo promulgavit, sed temporis nimia necessitas permittendum a nobis
extorsit. De caetero autem si quis hinc in posterum ab eo quem Simonaicum esse
non dubitat, se consecrari permiserit, and consecrator, and consecratus non
disparem damnationis sententiam subeat, sed uterque depositus poenitentiam
agat, and privatus a propria dignitate persistat. Nihilominus authoritate
Apostolica decernimus, quod in aliis Conventibus nostris decrevimus, ut si quis
pecunia vel gratia humana, vel populari seu militari tumultu, sine concordi and
canonica electione ac benedictione Cardinalium Episcoporum, ac deinde
sequentium ordinum religiosorum Clericorum fuerit Apostolicae sedi
inthronizatus, non Papa vel Apostolicus, sed Apostaticus habeatur, liceatque
Cardinalibus Episcopis cum religiosis, et Deum timentibus Clericis et Laicis,
invasorem etiam cum anathemate, cum humano auxilio et studio a sede Apostolica
repellere, et quem dignum judicaverint praeponere. Quod si hoc intra urbem
persicere nequiverint, nostra authoritate Apostolica extra urbem congregati in
loco qui eis placuerit, eligant, quem digniorem and utiliorem Apostolicae sedi
perspexerint, concessa ei authoritate regendi and disponendi res and utilitatem
Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae, secuduns quod ei melius vidibitur juxta qualitatem
temporis, quasi jam omnino inthronizatus sit: which justifies the Emperors
future deposing of such Popes by force of arms.

This Pope, was the first I meet with, who by these Constitutions robbed the
Emperor, inferior Clergy, Nobles and Citizens of Rome of their ancient Rights
and Jurisdictions in the elections of Popes, and vested it only in the Bishops
Cardinals, against all former presidents. Our English Apostle John Wickliff
asserted, that this election Wickliff Artic. 40. in Council. Constantiens. S^ss.

Cardinals have displayed themselves to be in most ages, places, since this

Phylacteria sua in tantum dilataverunt, ut non modo Episcopos (quos
Episcopellos solent passim vocare) sed Patriarchas, Primates, sed

faciunt unum corpus cum Papa, (qui omnes Dignitates mundi praecedit, and est
superior, and major Imperatore) et judicant totum mundum. No wonder then if
Popes elected by these new upstart, reprobate Lucifers, have advanced their
thrones above the Stars, and all that is called God, or worshipped; and
confederated with Popes to rob all Christian Emperors, Kings, Princes, Nobles,
Laymen of their Elections, Patronages, Advowsons, Presentations, Investitures,
(under the false Notion of Symony) to ingrosse them all into the Popes and
their own disposals, by way of Provisions, that they alone might have the
Monopoly of their sales to enhance the price.

Pope Nicolas having made these Decrees by Hildebrands advice, was by divine
retaliation taken in this his own net, thus recorded by In Gregor. 7.

Balaeus, to posterity. Postquam sedit Nicolaus, Hildebrandus, quia Papatura
adipisci non potuit, ad Archidiaconatum quoquo modo invadendum se convertit. Et
Mancium tunc Archidiaconum Roman Ecclesiae multis injuriis afflixit ac
circunvenit. Qui victus contumeliis and dolis, atque ejus Hildebrandi pecunia
deceptus, ad ultimum concessit, ut illius vice Archidiaconatu fungeretur. Hac
concessione arrepta Hildebrandus Papam Nicholaum ex improviso aggressus, coegit
inverecundis percibus and militum minis, quos pecunia collegerat, metum mortis
etiam quibusdam terribilibus significationibus incutiendo, ut eum Archidiaconum
ordinaret, atque constitueret. Et post paucos dies, Anno scilicet Domini 1061.
ipse Nicholaus defunctus est, veneno (ut dicitur) a Brazulo Hildebrandi
complice suffocatus; in pursuance of his own Decree. This Pope being thus sent
packing by Hildebrand, to make way for himself to possess his See: Cardinales,
Hildebrandi ambitionem non ignorantes, Imperatorem multis precibus coegerunt,
ut eis in Electo suo Parmensi Episcopo Cadolo favorem et aurilium praestaret.
Quod factum, cor Hildebrandi altius percussit, and manifest factus est ex illo
die Imperatoris inimicus: Omnia juratae fidelitatis vincula disrupit: and facta
conspiratione came (...) Imperatoris, and cum Normannis, ut quem Cadolo a
Cardinalibus Electo opponeret, Anselmum Lucensem Episcopum decepit, and eum in
Papam eligi a quibusdam Romany facit, Imperatore neque salutato, neque
consulto, ipsumque mutato nomine, Alexandrum secundum vocavit, Anselmum igitur,
quem sub dolo Romani elegerant, pariter, and Parmensem Episcopum Cadolum,
quibus poterat artibus Hildebranaus vexavit: qui utrique succedere anhelabat.
Cadolus being dispossed by Alexander, thereupon the Lombards sides with Cadolus
by the Emperors consent. Qui magno cum exercitu Romam obsedit: commissoque
praelio, uno atque altero, cum suis est fugatus. Henricus vero Imperator, ut
Schisma tolleretu, Othonem Coloniensem Archiepiscopum cum sua authoritate illuc
misit. Qui Romam veniens, multis egit de Imperatoris jure in eligendo
Pontifice, et in Alexandrum, qui sine consensu ejus electus esset, graviter
incusabat. Tunc Hildebrandus ad hominum perniciem natus, and propter victoriam
nuperrime partam elatior factus, orationem Archiepiscopi interrumpit,
acriterque tuetur Pontificis parts, Electionem ejus asserens esse apud Clerum.
Otho (plus fortassis, in ea re Pontifici quam Imperatori deferens) facile
cedit: petitque ut Synodus pro sedando Schismate Mantuae congregaretur. In qua
constituit Alexander, non esse missam audiendam a Sacerdote Concubinario
factam. Filiis tamen Sacerdotum sacris initiari licere permisit, interposita
Pontificis authoritate. Papam a solis Cardinalibus eligi decrevit: with other
particulars which I pretermit. Hereupon, (as De Romanorum Pontificum Actis, l.
5. p. 211.
Balaeus observes) His temporibus, (by Hildebrands persuasions and
instructions) Episcopi plusquam Principes, Regibus imperare ac leges
praescribere conantur, decimasque magna austeritate extorquent. Haec quoque
fuit eorum Vicariorum Christi religio, ut quo ventri luxuique suo
satisfacerent, non sunt veriti totas Nationes bellis immiscere. Accedit nunc In
Gregorio 7.
Bennonis Cardinalis de Alexandro Papa testimonium: Ubi Alexander, tandem
intellexit, se dolis and art ab Hildebrando and inimicis Imperatoris Electum
atque inthronizatum, quodam die cum intra Missarum solennia sermonem haberet ad
populum, praedicavit, se nolle sedere in sede Apostolica, absque licentia
Imperatoris: Et public dixit, Se literas hujus rei gratia missurum ipsi
Imperatori. (Such was his conscientious Loyalty, notwithstanding his
predecessor Adrians and the Council of Romes fresh Decrees to the contrary:)
Quo audito, Hildebrandus multa murmurando, vix manus, donec missa compleretur,
abstinuit. Missa vero expleta, ipsum Alexandrum cum militari manu, ab Altari
duxit in Cameram, and nondum exutum Pontificalibus indumentis, pugnis dure
colaphizavit, increpans, et improperans, quod vellet inquirere gratiam
Imperatoris. Et statuit Hildebrandus, ut ex eo die non darentur ei amplius quam
quinque solidi Lucensium denariorum: Et extunc Hildebrandus omnes redditus
Romanae Ecclesiae sibi retinuit (Alexandro in vincula conjecto) and immensam
pecuniam congregavit. Stel^a, in Alexandro 2.
Alexandro igitur sub miserabili jugo Hildebrandi Anno Domini MLXXIV. Anno 1074.
quodam vespere (non sine toxico fortalistis) defuncto, eadem hora Hildebrandus
a suis Militibus, sine assensu Cleri et populi est inthronizatus, timens ne
alius per moram eligeretur Contrary to his immediate Predecessors, and his own
Decrees. In cujus electione, nullus Cardinalium subscripsit. Ad quam cum
veniret Abbas Cassinesis, ait ipse Hildebrandus, Frater nimium tardasti.
Respondit Abbas, Et tu Hildebrande nimium festinasti, qui nondum sepulto Domino
tuo, Papae sedem Apostolicam contra Canones usurpasti. Hoc modo inthronizatus
Hildebrandus qualiter vixerit, qualiter a se Cardinales, qui testes vitae and
Doctrinae ejus esse debuerant, removerit; quam miserabiliter vexaverit, quantis
haeresibus mundum corruperit, quanta perjuria, quam immensas proditiones
consecraverit, vix a multis describi potest. Clamat tamen altius sanguis
Christianorum eo authore et incentore miserabiliter effusus. Sex aut octo
Pontifices (as Benno Cardinalis, Platina, Onuphrius, Balaeus, and others attest
in his life) Gerrardi Brazuti Judaei ministerio venenis enecavit, ut ita
sterneret ei ad Papatum via. Indeed In Gregor. 7.
Platina, Surius Council. Tom. 3. p. 602.
Surius, and others out of him record, that this Pope was unanimously elected,
not only by the Cardinals, (as the forecited late Popes and Councils Decrees
prescribed) but likewise by all the several Orders of the Clergy, and of the
people of Rome; That, adeptus Pontificatum Gregorius, Fuit is Henricus 4.
Imperator in gratiam cum Gregorio rediit, eundemque in Pontificatu
confirmavit, ut tum Imperatorum mos erat. But Benno Cardinalis, Balaeus, and
most others averr, that this Impostor, Incantator, ac praestigiator Diabolicus,
inaudita tyrannide Papatum invasit, statim usurpans Pontificiam sedem in ipsius
Alexandri defuncti, and latenter per ipsum veneno occisi, obsequiis. This

Johannes Aventinus records, Hildebrandus, qui and Gregorius septimus, fretus
armis Normannorum, etc. Primus, contra morem majorum, contempta Imperatoris
authoritate, Pontificatum maximum occupavit: Utramque personam sibi impositam
esse a Christo, se quodcunque ut liberet, ligare, solvere posse, jactitare,
utramque personam agitare. Occidentem adsere omnem potestatem in se transfer,
neminem parem nedum superiorem far, justa aliorum diminuere, caeteris jus
atque honorem praeripere, cuncta in se transfer. Caesares, Reges, Augustos,
ut precario regnantes, floccifacere; Pontifices, Episcopos in ordinem redigere,
devovere, capite diminuere; lites, bella concitare, discordias serere,
factiones confirmare, jusjurandum, pacta, sacramenta solvere coepit
capit: etiam si injuria vel ipsum Caesarem affecerit, tamen se metui oportere,
in quadam gloriatur Epistola; utpote qui errare non possit, and a Christo
Domino servatore nostro Petrque acceperit potestatem, ut solvat, ligetque
utcunque libeat. Tum mores ambitione avaritiaque corrupti paulatim invaluere,
tempora periculosa caepere, quae nobis cavenda Christus Servator noster, Petrus
ac Paulus longo ante tempore probe cantarunt. Tum illa quae de Sylvestro and
Constantino vulgo inculcantur, and alia pleraque, quae ob modestiam Christianam
refer pudet, non minus imperi^e, quam impudenter mendaciterque conficta sunt;
simulata religio, species pietatis invasit. Compilationes, mundinae sacrorum
irrepsere, and sacrosancta Philosophia humanis commentis, fabulis anilibus a
sychophantis callida interpretatione pollui, corrumpi, violari caepit, adeo, ut
sine multorum pernicie religio sancta procurari, and ad pristinam majestatem
restitui non possit, etc. After which he subjoynes, Hildebrandus primus
Imperium Pontificium condidit, quod Successores per 150. continenter annos
invito mundo, invitis Imperatoribus adeo duxere, ut inferos superos in
servitutem redegerint, atque sub jugum miserint, atque cuncta fulmine
perterruerint, Quo bruta tellus and vaga fluminae,
Quo Styx, and invisi horrida Taenari
Seeds, Atlanteusque finis
Concutitur; mutant ima summis.
Utcunque libet de coelo ad inferos praecipitant, rursus ex infero ad astra

sine specie. So Aventinus complains.

Atque cum omnium Principum, summus esset Imp. Henricus, ab ipso faciendum esse
exordium Simoniacae tragediae, arrogans Nebulo censuit: Inito igitur
Pontificatu, statim caepit urgere Canones antecessorum Pontificum, de Simonia
and Caelibatu, quos fecerant ejus usi astuto consilio: non ob id, (as Balaeus
observes) ut Beneficiorum Ecclesiasticorum impiam nundinationem tolleret, sed
ut aliqua ratione honesti Principibus eriperet potestatem conferendi
Ecclesiastica officia; et ut sic redigerentur sub servitutem Romanae sedis
omnes Episcopi, qui propter investiturae jus Principibus erant magis obnoxii et
fideles, quam Pontifici Romano.

The Original ground of this Popes subsequent insolent summons, Anno 1075.

Cardinal Benno in his life. Hildebrandus instabat Imperatori (per literas
Pontificalibus Cristis superbas, as others relate) ut ejiceret Episcopos
Simoniacos: quod ni faceret, non posse se parts officii sui exequi. Imperator
credens, quasi ex zelo legis, quasi a throno Dei procederent haec mandata, sine
mora obediebat; sine mora, sine discussione, sine judiciario ordine Episcopos
ejiciebat: dum per hanc obedientiam se Deo sacrificare existimabat, dum adhuc
versutias Hildebrandi minus intelligebat. Hildebrandus vero expulsos a Rege
Simoniacos relocabat, and quos Regi infestos reddiderat, eos sibi familiari
amicitia reconciliabat, and multis and magnis juramentis sibi fideles and
obnoxios efficiens praealiis exaltabat. Et modico tempore iis artibus regia
domo perturbata, and pene amicis de^tituta, sibi vero amicitia majorum
principum comparata, ex improviso, sine legitima accusatione, sine canonica
vocatione, sine judiciario ordine, obedientem sibi Imperatorem excommunicat, et
regni Principes ab eo separavit. Et cum Apostolus praecipiat, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 6.
Ne quis circumveniat in negotio fratrem suum; quantum in eo fuit, mortificavit
potius quam castigavit. Sic autem Imperator multimodo circumventus, praeter
Canonum ordinem excommunicatus, et consensu Hildebrandi et consilio, magna ex
part Imperii honor expoliatus, et bellis, et caedibus immensis fidelium
suorum praegravatus, frustra Canonicam audientiam imploravit. Among other
Bishops advanced by this Emperor, most Saxon Prelates as well as Princes
rebelling and taking up arms against him, Anno Dom. 1075. with some more German
Bishops revolting from the Emperor, and joining with these Rebels, against
their allegiance; were thereupon deprived by the Emperor of their Bishoprics,
who put others in their places. Having vanquished the Saxons in a set battle,
he imprisoned diverse of these Prelates and Princes; who escaping out of prison,
to strengthen their rebellious party and engage this Pope against their
lawful Sovereign, (to whom they knew him a professed implacable enemy,
designing his utter ruin) Anonimus Historia de vita Henrici 4. Caesaris,

videntes Regem bellis tangi posse, non dejici, vexari, non superari, quippe
cujus robur adhuc erat inexpugnabile; Thereupon, ut vires ejus extenuarent,
confictis, conscriptisque super eo criminibus, (quae pessima et immundissima
potuit odium et livor excogitare, et quae mihi scribenti and tibi legenti
nauseam pararent, vera falsis miscentes) apud Romanum Pontificem Gregorium
septimum eum deferebant; non decere tam flagitiosum, plus notum crimine quam
nomine, regnare: maxim cum sibi regiam dignitatem Roma non contulerit;
oportere Romae suum jus in constituendis Regibus reddi: providerent Apostolicus
et Roma ex consilio Principum, cujus vita et sapientia tanto congrueret honori.
Qua surreptione delusus Apostolicus, simul et honor creandi Regis, quem sibi
fallaciter obtulerant, impulsus, Regem banno innodavit, et Episcopis aliisque
regni Principibus, ut a communione excommunicati Regis se retraherent,

Ecclesiasticis, and potissimum de regno tractaretur. Quin etiam and hoc
addidit, absolvit omnes a juramento, qui fidem Regi juraverant, ut contra eum
impelleret absolutio, quos fidei tenuit obligatio. Quod factum multis
displicuit, (si cui displicere licet quod Apostolicus fecit) et asserebant, tam
inefficaciter quam illicite factum quod factum est. Sed non ausim assertiones

Grata admodum Gregorio alioqui faciles aures vituperantibus atque
criminantibus Caesarem praebere solito, istaec fuere: tanto Cardine rerum
nequaquam cessandum arbitrabatur: quippe sibi persuaserat, tempus oportunum
venisse, quando Romanos Flamines a servitute vindicaret, Imperatoris jugum,
ejus opibus diminutis, excuteret, authoritatem antiquaret, omnem potestatem in
se transfer liceret, itaque Principatum Pontificalem confirmaret. Nihil
speciosius videbatur, quam sublato metu, neminem mortalium formidare. Et ut
liberet Ecclesiastica liberate persru^ atque esse Imperatorem, cujus arma,
vis, non metuerentur; ut qui arbitrio Romani Pontificis precario duntaxat
regnaret. Gregorius ergo haec mente observans, Saxonum animos verbis confirmat,
sibi hanc rem curae fore respondet; se propediem in Germaniam profecturum,
Concilium totius Imperii in certum diem indicturum, ubi communi consensu de

Henricus Dei gratia Rex, Annoni Coloniensi Archiepisco, gratiam, salutem
dilectionem; In maximis negotiis, maximis maximorum opus est consiliis, qui and
facultatem habeant exterius, and voluntate non careant interius; ut rei cui
been cupiunt, been consulere, and velint and possint. Quia in cujuslibet rei
profectu, nec facultas sine voluntate, nec volantas sine facultate proderit:
quod utrumque tu sidelissime (ut arbitramur) aequaliter possides: vel ut verius
dicamus, licet maximo tibi, maxima non desit facultas, major tamen adhuc maxima
facultate (si te been novimus, si fidem tuam diligenter not avimus) in nostram
and regni utilitatem tibi exuberat voluntas; de praeteritis emm fideliter
exhibitis, in futuris crescit spes fidelius exhibendis. Tuae autem dilectioni
committimus, ne spes nostra sit major fide tua: quia de nullius regni Principum
vel Episcoporum fidelitate, quam (...), majora speramus; sicut bactenus non
modo in praeteritorum rerum exhibitione, verum etiam in sperandarum promissione
tua gavisi sumus. Adsic igitur hoc in temport opportuno, tua cum facultate
voluntas, quam non modo nostra, verum etiam omnium Episcoporum, fratrumque
tuorum, imo totius oppressae Ecclesiae exoptat necessitas. Non etiam hanc
oppressionem ignoras; tantum vide, ne oppressae te Ecclesiae subtrahas, sed
regno and sacerdotio condolcas; quo utroque, sicut hucusque Ecclesia est
exaltata, ita nunc heu humiliatur viduata. Nam unus dum utrumque sibi
vendicavit, utrumque dissipavit: nec in uno profuit, qui in neutro prodesse
voluit, nec potuit. Et ne diutius notati nomine te suspendamus, accipe quem
dicimus, Hildebrandum scilicet, Monachum habitu, quidem dictum Apostolicum, non
pastoris cura, sed invasoris violentia Apostolicae sedi praesidentem: and de
sede pacis catholicae pacis untae vincula dissipantem, ut tibimet in promptu
est scire. Vt enim de pluribus pauca referamus, Regnum et Sacerdotium Deo
nesciente sibi usurpavit; in quo piam Dei ordinationem contemp^it, quae non in
uno, sed in duobus duo, id est, Regnum et Sacerdotium, principaliter consistere
voluit: sicut and ipse Dominus Salvator noster in passione sua, de duorum
gladiorum sufficientia typica, intelligi innuit; cui cum diceretur, Luke 22.
38. See here p. 63, 64, 65, 66.
Ecce Domine duo gladii hic, respondit, satis est; significans, hac sufficienti
dualitate, spiritualem and carnalem glalium in Ecclesia esse gerendum, quibus
omne nocivum fore tam putandum: videlieet, Sacerdotali, ad obedientiam Regis
pro Deo: regali vero gladio ad explodendos Christi inimicos exterius, et ad
obedientiam Sacerdotii, interius, omnem hominem docens fore constringendum: and
ita de alia in aliam Charitatem tenderetur, dum nec regnum Sacerdotii, nec
Sacerdotium regni honor privaretur. Hanc Dei ordinationem qualiter
Hildebrandica insania confuderit, tu ipse nosti, si scire voluisti, nam nullum
ejus judicio lice^ esse Sacerdotem, nisi qui hoc a fastu suo emendicaverit. Me
quoque, quem Deus in regnum, non autem illum vocavit in Sacerdotium, quia me de
Deo, et non de illo regnare velle vidit, quia ipse me Regem non constituit,
regno privare studuit, minitans, regnum animamque mihi se tollere, quorum
neutrum concessit. Haec and his similia cum saepius in nostram (ut ipse nosti)
contumeliam struxerit, non tamen adhuc sufficere credit, qui de die in diem,
nova and exquisita confusionis genera nobis ingerit, ut in nostris nunciis
noviter argumentum dedit. Nam Charta exponere non sufficit, qualiter eosdem
Nuncios nostros tractaverit, quam indignis modis affecerit, Nota.
quam crudeliter eos incarceravit, and carceratos nuditate, frigore, fam^,
siti, ac plagis contriverit, sicque demum in exemplum per medium Civitatis

Tyranno insanire, and Sanctos assare credas, and dicas. Unde ne pigeat
charissime, communi nostrum, scilicet and mea and coepiscoporum tuorum
petitioni satisfacere, ut in Pentecostem Wormacia^ venias, and ibi plura,
quorum pauca docet Chartula, cum caeteris audias Principibus, and quid agendum

The Emperor, Bishops and Abbots being assembled in this Synod at Worms, statim
de Hildebrando deponendo consilia tractare caeperunt: His itaque consedentibus,
Hugo Blancus Cardinalis Romanus supervenit, cum literis eorum quos in Urbe Roma
Pontifex habebat adversarios. Illae in frequenti Senatu lectae sunt, in quibus,
Hildebrandum perjurii, et ambitus accusant; eundem pleraque avare, superbe
facere conqueruntur, hocque rejecto alium Pastorem postulant. ^it Patrum
consultum; hujuscemodi, Hildbrandus, qui se Gregorium nuncupat; Primus sine
consensu nostro, adversus Imperatoris Romani, rerum Domini a Deo constituti,
voluntatem, contra morem majorum, contra leges, contra auspicia, Pontificatum
maximum, quem pridem ambivit, et judicio convictus perpetuo abjuravit, invasit,
etc. (Huic Hildebeando, qui (...) in Ecclesiastico rigore constantissimus fuit,
ista causa (Clementis 2.) in qua sententia Principis and Episcoporum
praevaluit, semper displicut. Exhinc Romanae Ecclesiae in electione Canonica
Pontificum in tantum infirmata invenitur, quod iste, quatuorque sequentes, ab
Imperatore ibi positi, in Catalogo (Pontificum) inveniantur. Qualibet autem

absque consensu Regis per electionem constitutus fuerat; writes Otto Frisinger

sacrosanctam Philosophiam adulterat, divinas literas falso interpretando suae
causae servire cogit, concordiam Collegii scindit, sacra, prophana, divina,
humana comnuscet; utrumque juxta polluit, Diabolis, hoc est acerbissimorum

Neminem initiatum rite esse docet, nisi qui ab eo sacerdorum emendicarit, atque
ab ejus aurisugis mercatus fuerit: vili plebecula gratificari studet, vulgi
imperiti auram captat, simulata religione, decipit, defraudat, circumvenit: in
senatulo muliercularum de Sacratissimis religionis mysteriis pertractat;
supremi numinis legem, qua se idem quoque ligavit, solvit; utrumque, and
Imperium et Pontificatum, sicut Decit, et falsorum Deorum cultores factitare
consueverunt, usurpat. Hasce ob causas, sanctissimus Imperator, Pontifices,
Senatus, populusque Christianus, illum Hildebrandum abdicandum, sibi eundem non
placere, neque oves lupo committendas, censent. Damnationi Pontificis, haud
grava^am omnes qui tunc aderant Episcopi, subscripserunt, praeter Adelberonem
Herb. polens^^ and Hermannum Mediomatricum Episcopos; minus id convenire, and
Canones violari asserentes, quibus Episcopus quivis sine Generali Concilio,
sine Legitimis and probatis accusationibus and testibus, necdum probatis quae
objicerentur criminibus condemnari, prohiberetur: multo magis Romanus Pontifex,
adversus quem nec Episcopi nec Archiepiscopi quicquam haberet ponderis
accusatio. Verum Trajectensis Praesul Willielmus monendo eos, ut vel damnationi
Pontificis subscriberunt, vel Fidei Regis, quam Sancta attestatione
promisissent, renunci^^^ent, utrosque tandem in reliquorum pertraxit
sententiam. Omnium itaque nomine Literae ad Hildebrandum adornantur, quibus,
commemoratis prius ejus criminibus, Pontificatu quam contra leges hactenus
usurpasset, se abdicare jubetur. Verum ipsas subjecimus literas. Cum primum
Ecclesiae gubernaculum invasisses, etsi been nobis cognitum esset quam
illicitam and nefariam rem contra jus and fas familiari tibi arrogantia

HENRICUS, non usurpative, sed pia ordinatione Dei, Rex, Hildebrando jam non
Apostolico, sed falso Monacho. Hanc talem pro confusione tua salutationem
promeruisti, qui nullum in Ecclesia ordinem praetermisisti, quem confusionis,
non honoris, maledictionis, non benedictionis, participem non feceris. Ut enim
de multis, pauca and egregia loquamur; Rectores Sanctae Ecclesiae, videlicet
Archiepiscopos, Episcopos vel Presbyteros, non modo non tangere, sicut Christos
Domini non timuisti; quin sicut Servos, nescientes quid faciat Dominus eorum,
sub pedibus tuis calcasti, in quorum conculcatione tibi favorem ab ore Vulgi
comparasti, quos omnes nihil scire, te autem solum omnia nosse judicasti: qua
utique scientia non ad aedificationem, sed ad destructionem uti studuisti, ut
jure hoc beatum Gregorium, cujus nomen tibi vendicasti, de te credamus
prophetasse, dicentem sic, Ex affluentia subjectorum plerunque animus Praelati
extollitur; existimat se plus omnibus nosse, cum se videat plus omnibus posse.
Et quidem nos omnia haec sustinuimus, dum Apostolicae sedis honorem conservare
studuimus: sed tu humilitatem nostram timori fore intellexisti: ideoque et in
ipsam regiam potestatem nobis a Deo concessani, exurgere non timuisti, quam a
nobis auferre ausus es minari, quasi a te nos regnum acceperimus: quasi in tua,
et non in manu Dei sit Regnum vel Imperium, quia Dominus noster Jesus Christus
Nos ad regnum, te autem non vocavit ad Sacerdotium. Tu enim his gradibus
ascendisti, scilicet astutia, (quod Monachica professio abominatur) pecuniam,
pecunia favorem, favore ferrum, ferro sedem pacis adisti: et de sede pacis,
pacem turbasti: dum subditos in Praelatos armasti; dum Episcopos nostros, a Deo
vocatos, tu non vocatus spernendos docuisti: dum Laic^s Ministerium eorum super
Sacerdotes usurpasti, ut ipsi deponant vel condemnent, aut ipsos de manu domini
per impositionem manuum Episcoporum docendos acceperant. Me quoque (licet
indignus inter Christianos sum ad regnum vocatus) te test, quem Sanctorum
Patrum traditio soli Deo judicandum docuit, pro aliquo crimine nisi a fide
(quod absit) exorbitaverim, deponendum asseruit; Cum etiam Iulianum Apostatam
prudentia sanctorum Episcoporum, non sibi, sed soli Deo deponendum commiserit.
Ipse vero quid verus Papa beatus Petrus, clamat? 1 Pet: ^. 17.
Deum timete, Regem honorificate. Tu autem quia Deum non times, me constitutum
ejus inhonoras. Unde Beatus Paulus, ubi Angelo de Coelo, alia si praedicaverit,
non pepercit, te quoque in terris alia docentem non excepit: ait enim, Gal: 1.
8,
Siquis vel Ego, vel Angelus de Coelo, praeter id quod evangelizavimus, vobis
evangelizaverit, anathema sit. Tu igitur hoc Anathemate, et omnium Episcoporum
nostrorum judicio damnatus, Descend; vendicatam tibi sedem Apostolicam
relinque; alius in solium beati Petri ascendat, qui nulla violentia religionem
palliet, sed ^cati Petri sanam doctrinam doceat. Ego Henricus Dei gratia, cum
omnibus nostris Episcopis tibi dicimus, Descend, Descend.

cui debetur absentia, nec longi temporis taedio immutatur. Et de alia Epistola:
Exurgite in eum fidelissimi; et primus in fide, sit prmus in ejus damnatione;
non autem ut ejus sanguinem effundatis dicimus: quippe cum major sit sibi post
damnationem poena, vita, quam mors. Sed ut eum, si nolit descendere; cogatis,
et alium communi omnium Episcoporum vestrorum consilio a Nobis electum, in
Apostolicam sedem recipiatis, qui quod iste in Ecclesia vulneravit, curare

Bertoldus Constantiensis, thus relates the proceedings; His temporibus
Henricus Rex per Simoniacam haeresin Ecclesiam faedare non cessavit, scilicet
pro pretio Episcopatus, Abbatias, and alia hujusmodi investiendo, and inter
alia crimina etiam excommunicatis communicando. Cum autem Rex jamdudum saepe a
Papa praemonitus se corrigere nollet, and Papa in admonendo nihil proficeret;
ad ultimum mandavit ei, quod in Romana Synodo proxima eum excommunicaturus
esset nisi resipisceret. Quae Legatio in oclava Nativitatis Domini ad Regem
pervenit. Unde Rex in Septuagesima apud Wormatiam colloquio facto, and aliam in
Lombardia apud Placentiam, omnesque quos potuit, obedientiam praedictae Papae
exhibendam abiurare fecit; and missa Legatione ad Romanam Synodum, quae in
proxima Quadragesima celebrata est, ipsum Apostolicum ab Apostolica sede
contumaciter jussit descendere. Sed missi ejus turpissime in Synodo tractati,
vix a Romany, adjuvante Papa, evaserunt. Ipsum autem Regem, Synodo iudicante,
fidelitate hominum, regno, et communione privavit, et omnes ei ad Regnum
juratos, juramento absolvit. Omnes Episcopos qui Regi sponte contra Papam
fuerunt, officio and communione privavit; reliquis autem, qui inviti eidem
corspirationi intererant, usque ad festivitatem Sancti Petri inducias dedit.

The Pope in the mean time to engage the Romans to side with him against the
Emperor, Aventinus Annal. Boiorum l. 5. p. 45^. Cent. Magd. 11. c. 8. col. 424,
425.
Romae concionem in Templum vocat, cum Sacerdotibus, equitatu, plebe, Senatu
agit; Caput mundi (inquit) Romani rerum Domini, victor gentium populus, et
Imperium et Pontificatum, in quos libuerit, transfer potest: (where then is
the Popes Supremacy, and Cardinals right of electing Popes without the Romans
precedent consent or privity?) Sicut ante ducentos and septuaginta quinque
annos, a Gracis in Germanos transtulit: (therefore not Pope Leo the 3d. See
here p. 178, 180.
as Pontificians falsely boast.) Quemadmodum militem ignavum Imperator
exauthorare potest, ita milti ducem in injustum deserere licet. Vestrum munus
est Quirites, vestrum est beneficium, vestro sanguine atque sudore tantum
partum Imperium, quod bonum, faustum foelixque sit. Mecum, filii charissimi
decernetis, quinam Romae posthac regnarit, nec me superstite Rer liberos
populo, quem non creavit, imponetur. Post haec Gregorius millia talentum,
quindicies viritim distribuit. Ea a Normannis and Machtylda contributa fuere.
Opes quoque Ecclesiesticas, quibus hacterus pauperes alebantur, militibus and
rei bellicae peritis largitus est. Quod and Hildebrandini, Gerochus and Paulus
non inficias eunt, and hic tanquam benefatum excusat, and id licere defendit.
Romanus ergo hoc donativo oppigneratos, specio^o nomine libertatis inescatos,
Gregorius facile ad se deficere persuasit. Dum autem talia fiunt, Rulandus

Tibi (ad Hildebrandum inquit) Caesar noster Christianissimus, Sanctissimi
Italiae, Germaniae, Galliae Episcopi, sacer orbis Christianus praecipiunt, ut
te munere, quod astu, pecunia, gratia occupasti, confestim abdices. Nec enim
fas est invitis illis, Nota
te adversus authoritatem Imperatoris, contra Christianae Ecclesiae Decretum,
ovili Dei ultra incubare. Deinde ad caeteros versus; Pientissimi (inquit)
fratres, Pastorem jure vestro deligite: deinde sacratissimus Consul, Tribunus
and Princeps vester, more majorum author fiet: Iste enim Hildebrandus, neque
Pastor, neque Pater, neque Pontifex; Fur est, Lupus, latro atque Tyrannus. Vix
haec fatus erat, Joannes Portuensis prosilit, facto impetu surgens, and immensa
voce clamavit, capiatur, capiatur ingeminat. Fit tumultus: Urbis praefectus and
caeteri Parmensem gladiis strictis circumsistunt, in Temploque confodere
parant, Ille vix open Gregorii (ut Paulus refert) evasit. Post haec Pontifex
multis verbis, amarissime in Caesarem perorat; flagitia, quibus a Saxonibus
inustus erat, aperte dicit, crimina memoriter recitat: Tum ab omnibus (uti mos
gentis: est) acclamatum, Immanis Tyrannus a fastigio rerum deturbetur:
truculentissimus rei publicae et Ecclesiae hostis, sacro ense cum sociis et
consultoribus feriatur, atrocissimum facinus ferro recidatur. Alius qui Romano
Imperio dignus sit, substituatur. Gallina tum Romae ovum serpente quasi art
celatum, peperit. Gregorius posteaquam hujuscemodi dicta sunt, ovum Imperium,
serpentem Regem, qui Romae domicilio Imperii conterendus sit, interpretatur.
Multa dein de innocentia and potestate sua praefatur. Deinde Hildebrandus,
velut alter Machabaeus (ut, inquit Gerhobus Reicherspergensis) gladium
arripiens; B. Petri Apostolorum Principis nomine invocato, Caesarem Anathemate,
his conceptis verbis percellit. Henrico Regi, silio Henrici Imperatoris, qui
contra tuam Ecclesiam inaudita superbia insurrexit, totius regni Teutonicorum,
and Italiae Gubernacula contradico, et omnes Christianos a vincula Iuramenti
quod sibi fecere vel facient, absolvo; et ut nullus ei sicut Regi serviat
interdico. Atque ita absolvit omnes a juramento qui fidem Regi juraverant, ut
contra eum impelleret absolutio quos fidei tenuit obligatio.

Annal. Boiorum, l. 5. p. 453, 454.
Johannes Aventinus in his Annals, presents us with this larger, and more
particular relation of Hildebrands invectives and proceeding against the
Emperor, after his sentence denounced against him in this Synod, what sad
effects they produced, and what opinion most sober disingaged men had thereof.
Postremo ubi hujuscemodi multa Gregorius dixit, concionem ut bono animo sit,
and se Christo propitio, fortiter ad resistendum sacrilego, lascivo, temerario,
injusto, imperito, superbo, avaro, crudeli, impuro inveni paret, cohortatur.
Nordmannos, Machtyldam, Saxones armis invictos, divi Petri rebus studere, alios
haud dubie fulmine sacro attonitos causam justiorem secuturos; beatos denique
esse proponit, qui persecutionem patiantur. Post haec Concilio dimisso,
sexcenta fulmina, totidem tonitrua, diram gradinem, bullas appellant, in
Galliam, Germaniam, Italiam mittit. Docet, a se Regem qui Christianam
Philosophiam contemnat, Templum subver^at Haereticorum author sit et
consectaneus, execratuni, regnoque ab dicatum. Omnes qui in ejus verba
Religione adacti jurarint, et Sacramento solutos esse, commemorat. Exinde se
Majorum vestigia, Patrum scita, placita Magistorum Ecclesiae, legem divinam,
summum coelestis Thesauri jus, se insequi. Christum Dominum Deum nostrum D.
Petro, ejusque successoribus Romany Episcopis censuram totius orbis humani
detulisse, eosdenque caelitus constitutos Censores esse, qui judicarent de
moribus, deCuria Coelesti, atque Spiritibus aeter nis, nedum mortalibus. In
arcanis sacrae Historiae contineri, divina oracula esse; Tu es Petrus, and
super hanc Petram aedisicabo Ecclesiam meam, and portae inferi non praevalbunt
adversus eam; Man 16. 18. (...)*
and Tibi dabo Claves Regni coelorum, Quodcunque ligaveris super terram, erit
ligatum and in coelis. Nemo omnium (inquit Septimus) ne Reges quidem atque
Imperatores hic excipiuntur. Recitat inde veterum gesta, ubi legamus Hyldericum
a Romano Pontifice non ob flagitia, sed quod inutilis foret, regno amotum;
Francosque jurejurando, quo illi astricti erant, a Primario Urbis Sacerdote
absolutos; ab eodem Pipinum Regem substitutum esse. Imperatoribus Theodosio,
Arcadio, Philippo, Anastasio, Ambrosium, Innocentium, Constantinum, Anastasium
Episcopos sacris interdixisse. Addit, in gestis divi Peteri contineri, ejus cui
Pontifex maximus infensus sit, sermonem, conspectum, tanquam dirae contagionis
pestem, vitandum esse. Proinde concludit, qui quidem animam suam salvam esse
velit, Regi devoto per sacrosanctam Religionem audiens dicto non sit; imo
Vniversi Imperata mandataque detrectent rebellionemque faciant. Saxonas quoque,
veteres amicos Gregorius muneribus explet. Neminem spernendum, neminem
contemnendum esse decernit; quaecunque potest largiendo, pollicendo parare,
nequaquam cunctatur. Scinditur in contraria populus Germanus studia. Principes
apud Oppenhaim, oppidum superioris Germaniae, Rhenum continuum coeunt; pars,
sicut Hugo Alsatius, ob egestatem atque inimicitiam (nemo enim est qui omnibus
placeat, aut denique host careat) omnia misceri bello, ubi ditarentur, ac
vindictam sumerent, omnia Mart, cui cuncta licent, ardere avebant. Rudolphus
Burgundionum, ac Suevorum regulus, senectute venerabilis domi forisque
praeclarus, caeteris Principibus bonis artibus praestans, Cui Soror Caesaris
nuptum collocata erat, cum Berchtoldo a Zaringen genero suo, cum hostibus, quos
tamen maxima clade pro Caesare fratre Uxoris suae pugnans affecerat, spe Regni
inescatus, sentire caepit. Welpho quoque Dux Boiorum nova molitur. Sigefridus
Mogontinus Archimystes, Hermannus Mediomatricum, Albertus Vangionum Episcopus,
Willelmus Hersauentium Monachorum antistes in Boiaria, Altmannus genere Saxo
Bathavensis Pontifex, cum Gebhardo Suevo Juvavensium Pastore, Adalberone Boio,
clarissimis Natalibus orto Wurtzeburgensium primario Sacerdote, condiscipulis
suis (quippe eodem tempore Lutetiae Parisiorum literis operam dederant) sub
toga and censura Sanctissimorum Patrum, melius quam sub armis and strepitu
forensi Caesarum, tranquillitati and Reipublicae Christian consultum iri
arbitrabantur. Atque hi omnes quos commemoravimus, ad Saxonas sine cunctatione,
deserta Caesaris optimatiumque causa, deficiunt, ad praetextum mutatae
voluntatis religionem obtendunt. Hainricum communi consilio abjurant, se
perpetuo ejus fore hosts, quoad vita suppetat, jure jurando sanciunt. Postea
arma capessunt, Caesari insidiantur, ejus rebus students oppugnant, omnia
tumultu, cuncta terrore and luctu complentur. Caedes, incendia fiunt; insontes
and qui neutri parti favebant, qui ^idem Regi servabant, rebellare recusabant,
pacem and otium bello praeferrebant, armis se commiscere abnuebant, Simonaici
Nicolaitae Haeretici appellantur, proscribuntur, in sce^eratorum numero
habentur, aris sacris, convivio, colloquio, suppliciis, conspectu a conjuratis
arcentur. Sacerdotes, Monachi, Episcopi, fratres Germani, amici, cognati,
affines, liberi, parents, miles, tribunus, herus, famulus, pueri, puellae,
conjuges, populus, Principes inter se discordant, dissentiunt public, privatim
altercantur, rixantur, pugnant, belligerantur, invicem mutuis vulneribus,
caede, parricidio, incendiis, rapina conflictantur: agri vastantur, fana
spoliantur, aerarium diripitur, fiscus exinanitur, villae incenduntur, a
design concremantur, urbes, castella vi expugnantur, leges silent, arma
fervent, omne jus in viribus est. Quicquid victori collibuisset, victus
patitur, virgins rapiuntur, liberi a complexu parentum avelluntur, matres
familiae vi constuprantur: terra, flumina, humano cruore rubescunt. Animae cum
corporibus intereunt, ad inferos raptantur, aeternis suppliciis mactantur.
VVurizeburgenses, Vangiones, Mediomatrici, Bathavi, Salesburgenses Episcopos
suos exigunt, quod contra instituta Majorum Civibus suis suadebant, solemn
fidei polluere, cujus Germaniae populos patientissimos esse inter illustres
gravesque rerum authors, licet hosts nostros convenit. Pastores igitur illi
extorres, sine lare, sine ovibus errabundi, destituti ovili, ad Saxoniam se
conferunt. Plerique tum privatim, public indignum facinus clamitant, pro
concione Gregorio maledicunt, Hildebrando male precantur, Antichristum esse
praedicant; pietatis sub specie (inquibant) debacchatur, honestis nominibus
bonum Publicum simulat, titulo Christi negotium Antichristi agitat. In
Babylonia, 2 Thessalonians. 2
in Templo Dei sedet, super omne id quod colitur, extollitur, quasi Deus sit,
se errare non posse, gloriatur: In excolenda gloria sua pertinacis spei, atque
concupiscentiae Imperatoris suo arbitrio constituendi, se devovet; homines non
peccatis, sed lege Christi atque Sacramentis solvit, pacem, atque pietatem
religionis nostrae labefactat, bella, seditiones concitat, stupro, caedi,
perjuriis, perfidiae, rapinis, incendio ambitionem suam occulendam, fabulas
comminiscitur, annals corrumpit, res gestas invertit, sed etiam coelestia
oracula adulterat; divinas Literas falso interpretando suae libidini servire
cogit, sacram Historiam lacerat, inter mulierculas de sacris Philosophatur
literis. Quicquid dixerit, Legem Dei putat; ad aviditatem suam incongrua
conquirit testimonia, sententias depravat, ad voluntatem suam Scripturam trahit
repugnantem. Nimium sibi de Pharisaeorum supercilio sumit, ut quosque damnare
vel solvere arbitretur, cum apud Deum, non sententia Sacerdotis sed vita
hominis quaeratur. Praeterea Hildebrandus ille divinae Majestati refragatur,
Christianissimo Principi divinitus constituto, et a Deo inaugurato resistit:
versutus, fallax, obscurus, callidus, imperium Orbis, titulo Christi, sub ovina
pelle, ambit. Alios, pecudes ignavas, stultos, stipites, caudices, Asinos qui
ejus Sycophantias vaframentaque non intelligant, putat. Huc omnes nervos

Aventinus Annal. Boiorum, l. 5. p. 456, 457. Pontificis Epistola ad
adversarios.
Posteaquam autem Pontifex Romanus haec accepit, ut hanc invidiam leniret,
adversarios placaret, suos confirmaret, Episcopis, Ducibus praefectis universis
Teutonibus Christianam Religionem defendentibus, ita modestius rescripsit. Et
si ea quae scimus, been, recte, sapienterque in celebri Romano coetu summa
prudentia, summo consilio gesta sunt: tamen accepi nos contra pietatem
Christianam egisse videri plerisque, qui egregium sane facinus, velut ab odio
and livore, ab Superbia atque aviditate profectum, carpunt, abominantur.
Quamobrem rationem actorum reddere, rem ordine explicare placuit. Test
conscientia nostra, nihil invidiae, nihil simultati, nihil ambitioni datum est.
Quicquid hactenus actum est, amore divinae justitiae feci. Dum adhuc privati
essemus, vocabamur amici parentum regis, quem crebro ac frequenter, and amice
Literis familiaribus commonuimus, ut resipisceret, eundem per Natales
clarissimos, per avitam paternamque gloriam and virtutem, per salutem, vitam,
ac majestatem imperii saepius obtestati sumus, ut rumorem de ejus sceleribus
(quae Deus ptohibeat ut edere in vulgus velim) dissipatum, falsum esse factis
coargueret. Idem (...) Pontificatum Max. adepti, jam communis ejus animi parens
factitavimus; Ipse itidem subinde nobis rescripsit, aetatem, fortunam,
potentiam paucorum, qui summam Imperii obtinerent, excusavit. Idcirco
purpuratos quosdam; quorum consilio Sacerdotia, Pontificatus, contubern^^^
Monachorum vaenibant, ac lupi templis non pastores praeficiebantur,
repetundarum postulavimus, condemnavimus. Postremo illos in malo
obstinatissimos execrati sumus. Henrico uti illos aula, praetorio, curia,
sermon exigeret, praecipimus. Verum enimvero tantum abfuit ut nobis recte
consultanti obtemperaverit, uti omnes Italiae, plerique Galliae atque Germaniae
Episcopi, ejus suasu atque instinctu, jugum D. Petri a Christo cervicibus ovium
impositum excusserint, Censuram Romanorum Pontificum rejecerint, and ut paucis
summam scelerum, illius explanem, Primo eos quos captae pecuniae accersivimus,
in numero sceleratorum impiorumque computavimus, devitare noluit, Deinde, non
solum nullam prae se fert spem resipiscendi, sed subnotari etiam a quopiam suos
mores gravi and iniquo patitur animo. Postremo, templum divinum dissensione
labefactare, discordiae mala serere studet. Neque precibus, neque minis ad
bonam frugem commovetur. Hasce ob causas eundem a Societate sacrosanctae
concionis amovimus, ex albo Christianorum erasimus, ut qui sponte recte facere
negligit, hac contumelia coactus officium suum, and quod se dignum est, faciat.
Si quidem ipse servari (quod Deus avertat) non vult, and omnino ad perniciem
suam per praeceps tendit, nos qui Pastores ejus, and rationem Deo de ejus anima
reddituri sumus, desidiae atque socordiae convinci, ac perinde perire nolumus.
Quid si utique quispiam, non tam Judicio, quam morbo animi nos uti, nostramque
sententiam injustam esse existimaret, si talis est, ut doceri queat, sacras
literas, decreta Magistrorum, Ecclesiae consulta, veterum annals nobiscum
evolvat, comperiet pro certo, nos plus aequo justoque humaniores, ne dicam
segniores fuisse. Quanquam neminem omnium esse credam qui mecum animo
dissentiat, tametsi quae sentiat palam eloqui forsitan non audeat. Enimvero si
ille a nobis injuste hoc fulmine afflatus foret, tamen eum supplicem venire
oporteret, veniam atque piaculum, quo solveretur petere. Proinde, pientissimi
filii, qui magis Deum quam homines timetis, qui justitiam regi, veritatem irae
praefertis, bono estote animo, labor, patientia, factis fortibus vires
exercete, bonis praeceptis obtemperate, fortiter adversus insanos facite.
Magnae curae magna merces est. Immortalis Imperatoris parts defenditis, qui si
caepto quoad vita fuppetat perseveraveritis, immortalitate, praemio virtutis
vestrae vos condonabit. Equidem perpepetuo Deum Opt. Max. deprecor, ut vobis
virtutem praestet, regem ad sanitatem redire cogat: tunc plane intelliget, me
and vos long eum magis amasse, majoremque gratiam ab eo inibimus, quam illi
qui animo indulgentes, assentando, palpando, adulando perversam gratiam
gratificantur. Si ille resipuerit, Omnium quae adversus me gesserit, oblivionem
decernam, and consilio vestro cum eo in gratiam redibo, in Templumque divinum
reducam.

Sub idem tempus idem Gregorius Saxonas sociosque certiores facit Romany
Concilium Augustam indictum displicere; tantam rem Romae, (ubi penetrale
Religionis nostrae, seeds and domicilium Imperii sit) transigendam esse; se
tamen, licet invitis Romany, Mantuam, quae Machtyldae pareat, profecturum, ubi
been inter bonos agier liceat. Mittuntur igitur a conjuratis ad Hildebrandum,
Maugoldus Veringensis dynasta, frater Hermanni historici, Aribertus mysta, cum
aliis compluribus, qui Pontificem Max. in Germaniam deducant.

Pope after this sentence, raised up such factions and Rebellions against the
Emperor, both in Germany, Saxony, Sweden, Hungary, Italy, and elsewhere, that
the German Prelates and Princes of the Popes faction, by his instigation,
threatened to choose another Emperor, unless he were absolved from his
Excommunication by the Pope within one year: whereupon the Emperor, to satisfy
them herein, sent an Embassy to the Pope, humbly petitioning him, to absolve
him from his Anathema: and the German Princes, conventu habito decernunt, ut si
Gregorius in Alemanniam pergat, Henricus supplex veniam errati petat: Quod se
facturum Rex ipse interposito juramento pollicitus est. The insolent Pope
receiving the Emperors Embassy by the Arclib. of Triers, and others, returned
this insolent answer at first (as Lamb. Schafnabergensis and others record) Si
veraciter, inquit, facti poenitet, Coronam et caetera regni insignia, in
argumentum verae et ex animo factae poenitudinis, nostrae potestati dedat, et
se post tam contumax admissum, Regio nomine et honor deinceps indignum
profiteatur. Durum nimis hoc visum est Legatis: Cumque vehementer insisterent,
ut sententiam temperaret, nec calamum conquassatum judicii austeritate penitus
contereret; Vix and aegre tandem exoratus annuit; ut cominus veniret, and si
veram pro admissis poeniten^^am gereret, culpam quam sedi Apostolicae
contumeliam irrogando contraxerat, sedis Apostolicae decretis nunc obediendo
expiaret. Hereupon the Emperor, by the Popes command, passing into Italy with
an Army, came to Canusium with all expedition, where the Pope then was with the
Countess Machtylda, and cum Castellum triplici muro septum esset, intra
secundum murorum ambitum receptus, foris derelicto omni comitatu suo, deposito
cultu and ornamento regio, nihil praeferens regium, nihil ostentans pompaticum,
nudis pedibus (ut oppidanos ad misericordiam commoveret) jejunus a mane usque
ad vesperam spectabat Romani Pontificis sententiam praestolando, suppliciterque
intromitti petebat. Hoc secundo, hoc tertio die fecit: Denegatum ingressum
aequo animo tulit, aut tulisse dissimulavit, quamvis aspera esset hyems, and
gelu cuncta rigescerent. Ante dies septem, quam finem Janus haberet, ante suam
faciem concessit Papa venire Regem cum plantis nudis, a frigore captis; In
cruce se jactans Papae, saepissime clamans, Parce beat Pater, pie parce mihi
peto plane. Papa videns stentem miseratus ei, Satis est, est. Nam benedixit
eum, Missam cantavit, corpus dedit et Deitatis. Domuizo Presbyter, l. 2. (...)

In suburbio quidem oppido triduo immuratus, continuo veniam petens,
perversoris judicis injuriam et violentiam patienter, et public, et cum
lachrymabili afflictione, nudis pedibus, et cum laneis vestibus, hyeme praeter
sol^tum aspera, apud Canusium, spectaculum Angelorum factus et hominum, et
Hildebrandi ludibrium triduo permansit: During which time (as Johannes
Aventinus relates) nunciari Pontifici jubet, Caesarem adesse, ut pacem cum eo
faciat bonorum virorum arbitratu, and salvo rerum statu; scilicet, ne sanguis
Christianus effundatur, neve stupra, incendia, parricidia, praedae (quae
licentia etiam belli justi impune committuntur) in populo Dei fiant, edantur:
Vnum postulare, ne contra fas jusque maledictis acerbissimorum hostium magis,
quam innocenti sibi credatur. Optimum quemque vituperationibus vulgi imperiti,
nedum inimicorum expositum esse, praecipue eum, qui in rerum fastigio, quasi
illustri loco and theatro collocatus, omnibus pateat. Ita humana sunt, nemo est
qui universis complaceat. Gregorium quoque vulgo male audire atque castigari,
quod familiarius frequentiusque secreto atque in occulto, quam tantum
Pontificem deceat, cum Maechtylda colloquatur. Saxonum Legati, qui praesentes
erant, intercedunt, ne pax fiat, summopere laborant. Quamobrem toto triduo
Caesar, in conspectum Pontificis non est admissus. At Hugo Monachorum
Cluniacensium Antistes, caeteriquae boni minis, precibus hortari, suadere,
orare, terrere, quovis modo instare, vociferari, pervicaciam hanc Tyrannidem
appellare, non desistere, donec pepulere, ut Gregorius tandem rogatu
Machtyldis, Ad^lai Sabaudiensis Comitis, and Clumacensis Abbatis, quarto die
introductus, absolvitur, and Ecclesiae reconciliatur, upon unreasonable
conditions Lambertu^ Scha^nabergensis Hist. Anno 1077. Centur. Magd. 11. cap.

Quarto demum die in conspectum ejus admissus, post multas hinc inde dictas
sententias, his postremo conditionibus excommunicatione absolutus est, ut die
and loco quemcunque Papa designasset, evocatis ad Generale Concilium Teutonicis
Principibus praesto esset, and accusationibus quae intenderentur, responderet:
ipso Papa, si ita expedire videretur, cognitore causarum assidente, and ad ejus
sententiam, vel retineret regnum, si objecta purgasset, vel aequo animo
amitteret, si probatis criminibus regio deinceps honor indignus, juxta
Ecclesiasticas leges decerneretur, nullam sive retento, sive amisso regno,
hujus injuriae vindictam a quopiam hominum in perpetuum exacturus. Usque ad eam
autem diem, qua causa ejus legitime discussa terminaretur, nulla Regno cultus

nulla regiae dignitatis insignia sibi adhiberet, nihil circa rerum publicarum
administrationem, juxta consuetudinem suo jure ageret, nihil quod ratum fore
oporteat decerneret. Postremo, praeter regalium servitiorum exactionem, quibus
necessario ipse and sui sustentandi essent, nihil regium, nihil publicum
usurparet; omnes etiam qui ei sub jure jurando fidem dirissent ab hujus
sacramenti viuculo, et conservandae erga cum fidei debito, apud Deum, et apud
homines interim liberi expeditique manerent. Rupertum Babenbergensem Episcopum,
and Udalricum de Cosheim, and caeteros, quorum consiliis se, remque publicam
prodidisset, a sua in perpetuum familiaritate amoveret. Quod si purgatis quae
objicerentur, potens confortatusque in regno perstitisset, subditus Romano
Pontifici semper, dictoque obtemperans foret, et ad corrigenda quaecunque in
regno ejus contra Ecclesiasticas leges prava consuetudine inolevissent,
consentiens ei, et pro virili proportione cooperator existeret. Ad ultimum, si
quid horum praevaricaretur, irritam fore hanc quae nunc tantopere expetita sit,
anathematis absolutionem. Quinimo jam pro convicto, confessoque habendum esse,
nec ultra pro asserenda innocentia sua, audientiam impetraturum, Principesque
regni omni deinceps quaestione, cuncta juris jurandi religione liberatos, regem
alium, in quem communis electio consensisset, creaturos esse. Gratanter Rex
accepit conditiones, and servaturum se omnia quam sanctissime poterat
assertionibus promittebat. Nec tamen promittenti temere fides habita est: sed
Abbas Cluniacensis, quoniam Jurare Monasticae religionis obtentu detrectabat,
fidem suam coram oculis omnia cernentis Dei interposuit. Episcopus quoque
Citicensis, and Episcopus Vercellensis, and Azzo Marchio and alii conventionis
ejus Principes, allatis Sanctorum reliquiis, sub Jure jurando confirmaverunt,

succedentium mutabilitate ab sententia deducendum. Upon consideration of these
premises, Cent. Magd. 11. c. 9. col. 431
Matthias Illyricus, Johannes Wigandus, and Andreas Corvinus, make these
observations, Vides, Christian Lector, exemplum dominationis Pontificiae, non
Petrinae absolutionis. Nemo enim Apostolorum tanto fastu usus est. Nihil hic
audis de fide in Christum. Tantum vero Hildebrandus sceptra Imperii jubet
deponi, sibi tradi, se coli: ut omnia nimirum pro suis cupiditatibus, tam in

Pope Gregory himself in his Letters to the Nobles of Germany, gives them this
Narrative of the Emperors and his own deportment in this Tragical transaction.
Ad oppidum Canusii in quo morati fuimus, cum paucis (Henricus) advenit; ibique
per triduum ante portum Castri, deposito omni regali cultu, miserabiliter,
utpote discalceatus, and laneis indutus persistens; non prius quam multo fletu
Apostolicae miserationis auxilium and consolationem implorare destitit; quam
omnes qui ibi aderant, and ad quos rumor ille pervenit, ad tantam pietatem, and
compassionis misericordiam movit, ut pro eo multis precibus and lachrymis
intercedentes, omnes quidem insolitam nostrae mentis duritiam mirarentur;
nonnulli vero in nobis, non Apostolicae severitatis gravitatem, sed quasi
tyrannicae feritatis crudelitatem esse clamarent. Denique instantia
compunctionis ejus, et tanta omnium, qui ibi aderant, supplicatione devicti,
tandem relaxato Anathematis vinculo, in communionis gratiam, and sinum Sanctae
Matris Ecclesiae recepimus. In what manner, and with what Papal faith and
sincerity he received him to the holy Communion and bosom of the Church,
himself relates: Binius Council. Tom. 3. pars 2. p. 1288.
Solam ei communionem reddidi, non tamen in regno, a quo eum in Romana Synodo
deposueram, instauravi; nec fidelitatem omnium qui sibi juraverant, vel erant

Johannes Aventinus largely insists on) a quibus Regem abstinere ad arbitrii
sui tempus decernit Papa; hujus scilicet intentionis gratia; ut sic, aut
contemptibilior esset ipsius Regis in regno persona, donec rehaberetur regnum,
quod jam parabatur in electione alterius, dum fuerat ipse legitimus Rex in
Italia: aut si non permissus a se regalia resumeret ornamenta, certiorem
perinde haberet circa eum caussam excommunicationis: quod videtur non esse
officium pietatis, nec signum concordiae et unitatis. How ill the Italians

Lambertus Schafnabergensis thus relates at large. Italiae Proceres ear
cognita admodum Regi indignabantur. Exclamabant, se Hildebrandi
excommunicationem nihili aestimare, quam ipsum omnes Italiae Episcopi justis ex
causis jampridem excommunicassent, qui Sedem Apostolicam per Simoniacam ha^resm
occupasset, adulteriis, aliisque capitalibus criminibus polluisset, Regem secus
ac deceat, crimenque gloriae suae intulisse nunquam abolendum, quod homini
haeretico et probris omnibus infamato, majestatem regiam summiserit: et quem
justitiae patronum, legumque Eccles, vindicem sibi parassent, is foedissima
subjectione sua, fidem plane Catholicam, authoritatem Ecclesiae, dignitatem
Republicae prodiderit. Se in ultionem ejus omnes quas potuerint Papae injurias
irrogasse; and nunc, quod dictu quoque turpe sit, se in mediis perturbationum
fluctibus relictis, ipsum sibi consuluisse; et cum host publico privata
necessitudine in gratiam redisse. Haec potissimum Principes Italiae jactando,
et passim per populum serendo, ingens Regi odium brevi conflaverant. Adulta
postremo seditione, una omnium voluntas, una sententia erat, ut abdicato patre,
qui ultro regni fascibus indignum se effecisset; filium ejus, licet impubem
adhuc, et regni negotiis immaturum, Regem sibi facerent: et cum eo Romam
profecti Papam alium eligerent; per quem and ipse protinus Imp. consecraretur,
et omnia Papae hujus Apostatici gesta cassarentur. Perlato ad Regem tam
molestae conspirationis motu, misit propere quicquid apud se Principum erat, ut
quacunque ratione, quaqua possent industria efferatae multitudinis animos
mitigarent: ne moleste acciperent, aut in contumelium suam factam reputaren^,
quod extrema necessitate compulsus communis commodi ratione fecisset: nec
Teutonicis Principibus, qui sibi per calumniam regnum eripere dedita opera
machinantur, nec Romano Pontifici, qui ad evertendum statum sanctae Ecclesiae
spirituali gladio circumquaque fulguraret; aliter satisfieri potuisse, quam ut
ante statutum diem excommunicatione absolveretur. Nunc se omnibus angustiis
quibus vias ejus conclusissent inimici, liberatum, omnem deinceps curam
industriamque ad vindicandas suas et illorum injurias translaturum.

Hermoldus records; that Henry after this sentence, accepit in mandatis, from
this Pope, ut anno integro Roma non discederet, equum non ascenderet, sed in
vest humili circumiret limina Ecclesiarum, or (...)bus and jejuniis, reddens
dignum poenitentiae fructum; Quod Rex humiliter adimplere sategit. Videntes
ergo Cardinales, and in quid de Curia sunt, quia prae timore sedis Apostolicae
contremiscunt potestates, et curvantur ii, qui portant orbem; suggerunt
Apostolico, ut transferat regnum ad alium virum: dicentes; indignum esse, ut
talis regnet, qui de publicis convictus est facinoribus. Percunctanti ergo
Apostolico, Quisnam in Alemannia dignus esset tanto culmine? Designatus est Dux
Suevorum Rudolphus, quod scilicet fuerit vir bonus, amator pacis, and circa
cultum Sacerdotii and Ecclesiarum optima affectus. Cui Dominus Papa auream
transmisit coronam, hoc versu intitulatam:

quibus etiam deductus Moguntiam, 12. Kalend. Aprilis, a Segifrido Episcopo in
Regem ungitur. Ubi eodem die pessimo auspicio, seditione facta, multa turba
vulgi caesa est ab ejus militibus, unde vulgus accensum in ipsos exarsit,
magnisque ictibus multos obtruncans; caeteros ad curiam palam fugavit, ipsasque
regias aedes incendere voluit; nisi quod Episcopus Sigefridus pro veloci
decessione Rudolphi obsidem se interposuit. Ita Rudolphus, and cuncti ei qui
cum eo venerant, ejecti sunt, ipse quoque Sigefridus Episcopus magnis
blasphemiis eliminatus, Moguntiam non intravit amplius. Whiles these things
were thus acted in Germany by the Popes treachery, Henricus consistebat apud
Romam Papae mandatis obsecundans, ignarusque malorum quae adversus ipsum
agebantur; as Chronicon Slavorum, l. 1. c. 28, 29. Aventinus, Annal. Boiorum,

Hermoldus informs us: Surrexit ergo quidam Strateburgensis Episcopus,
amicissimus Regi Henrico, and velociter veniens Romam, diu quaesitum regem,
invenit inter memorias martyrum diversantem: De cujus adventu Rex laetus
effectus, caepit percunctari de statu regni, aut si omnia in pace consisterent?
Cui ille intimavit, Novum Principem electum, factuque opus esse, ut quantocyus
Teutonicam terram reviseret, ad confortandos amicorum animos, and conatus
hostium repr^mendos. Cumque Rex praetenderet, nequaquam sibi sine licentia
sedis Apostolicae obeundum: The respondit; Noveris certe, omne hoc
conspirationis malum de part Roman^ perfidiae manasse. Imo si captionem
evadere voles, de urbe tibi clanculo exeundum est. Egressus ergo noctu Rex
exiit Italiam, formausque pro tempore rebus in Longobardis, venit in Teutonicam
terram. Laetatique sunt de insperato adventu Principis omnes Civitates Rheni,
and universi qui favebant parti ejus. Congregavitque exercitum grandem, ut
expugnaret Rudolphum. After which Anno 1078. Abbas Usperg^nsis, Chron: p. 223.

Henry routed Rudolphus in a pitched battle between them juxta Stronui: wherein
Bernardus Magdeburgensis Archimysta, author belli civilis, a popularibus inter

Quibus ita Gregorius respondit; Se pacis conditiones non abnuere, modo Henricus
ipse primo cum Deo pacem ineat; Non ignoratis, inquit, quamdiu and quantis
malis Romanam affecerit Ecclesiam; quotiesque a me sit admonitus, ut meliorem
vitam moresque probatiores indueret. Hoc tribuimus benevolentiae and Charitati
qua Henrico patri conjuncti olim fuimus, sed nil profecimus; adeo mores a patre
aversos imbibit. Instabant tamen ex his qui aderant nonnulli, Regem non ita

Nationes conscripsit, quibus se contra jus fasque damnatum a Pontifice

Abbas Uspergensis somewhat varieth the expressions of this Councils Decree;
Quia, inquiunt, (Gregorium) illum constat non a Deo electum, sed a seipso in
fraud ac pecunia impudentissime objectum, qui ecclesiasticum subvertit
ordinem, qui Christiani Imperii perturbavit regnum, qui Regi catholico ac
pacifico, corporis et animae intentat mortem, qui Rudolphus.
perjurum defendit Regem, qui inter concordes seminavit discordiam, inter
pacificos lites, inter fratres scandala, in conjuges divortia, et quicquid
quiet inter pie viventes stare videbatur, concussit: Nos authore Deo,
congregati in unum, Legatis ac literis freti tredecem et novem Episcoporum, die
sancto praeteritae Pentecostes Moguntinae congregatorum, contra eundem
Hildebrandum procacissimum, sacrilegia ac incendia praedicantem, perjuria et
homicidia defendentem, Catholicam et Apostolicam fidem, de corpore et sanguinis
Domini in quaestionem ponentem, Berengarii antiquum discipulum, divinationum ac
somniorum cultorem, manifestum Necromanticum, Phitonico spiritu laborantem, et
idcirco a vera fide exorbitantem, judicamus canonice deponendum et expellendum,
et nisi ab ipsa sede his auditis descenderit, in perpetuum condemnandum. Facta
sunt autem haec vij. Kal. Julii feria 5 Indict. 3. These Bishops in this
Council deemed the Emperor and themselves above the Pope, and enabled
judicially to depose him for these crimes.

Historia de v^ta Hiltebrandi Pontificis Romani. Set forth by Rein^rus
Reineccius Steinhemius, printed Franco^^^^^, 1581.
Benno Cardinalis, living under this Pope, and present at these transactions,
informs us of the names of many great Cardinals and others of note, who
condemned his proceedings against the Emperor as Tyrannical, Unchristian,
Heretical; and thereupon, qui Hiltebrandum reliquerunt, cujus intolerabiles et
gravissimos errores public detestati, nunquam ad eum reversi sunt: Diversae
etiam scholae Romanae Ecclesiae ab ejus communione recesserunt. Leo tunc
temporis Archipresbyter Cardinalium, and Benno, and Ugobaldus, and Johannes
Cardinalis, and Petrus Cancellarius and Cardinalis, ordinati ante tempora
Hiltebrandi: Natro, Innocentius, Leo, hi tres ab eo consecrati, deseruerunt eum
errores ejus execrati: similiter Theodinus Archidiaconus, quem ipse constituit
Archidiaconum, and alii Cardinales Diaconi: Johannes, modo Archidiaconus, and
Crescentius, Johannes primicerius scholae cantorum, cum omnibus suis: Petrus
oblationarius cum omnibus suis, excepto uno Poppo; Prior scholae regionariae
cum omnibus suis Subdiaconis: Archiacolythus, and Subpulmentarius cum suis:
Centius, Judicum primicerius cum aliis Judicibus, and cuncti Milites signa
banna gestantes, Prior scriniariorum, cum plerisque suis: Ipsi etiam Episcopi
cum jam vellent eum deserere, (as well as all those forementioned) Hiltebrandus
convocatis ad se Laicis, eis consilium suum aperuit, and quod Episcopos a
Colloquio Cardinalium vellet separare, indicavit. See Abbas Vspergensis Chron.
p. 223, 224. Centur. Magd. 11. c. 8. Barnes and Balaeus in Greg. 7. Sigonius de
Regno Italiae, l 9.
Post haec ipsos Episcopos convocavit, and turbis Laicorum stipatus,
Sacramentum ab ipsis Episcopis cum terrore et minis exegit et extorsit, in manu
sua jurare coegit, ne unquam ab eo dissentirent, nunquam Regis causam
defenderent, nunquam superordinato sibi Papae faverent, vel obedirent. Quo
facto eos per Principem Salernitanum in Campaniam misit: and sic eos a
consortio Cardinalium and a Romana Urbe separavit. Nec solum Episcopos, sed
etiam Urbis Presbyteros and inferioris ordinis Clericos, insuper and Laicos
juramentis alligavit, ne ulla ratione, ullo tempore, condescenderent in causa
Regis. These Cardinals and others forecited, who condemned, renounced communion
with this Pope, charged him with these practices: Quod ejectis a consilio and a
custodia ejus Cardinalibus, vita ejus and fides and Doctrina sine testibus
fuit; cum sacri Canones praecipia^t, ut in omni loco tres Cardinales
Presbyteri, and duo Diaconi Papam non deserant, propter testimonium
Ecclesiasticum, and propter stylum veritatis.

Scripturas sacras violenter intorsit in adjutorium falsitatis: quod genus
Idololatriae quantum sit, late patet in Scripturae sacrae campis spaciosis.
Praeter voluntatem et consilium Cardinalium, extra ordinem judicandi sacris
Canonibus determinatum, Imperatorem in nulla Synodo Canonice accusatum,
praecipitanter excommunicavit; in qua excommunicatione nullus Cardinalium
subscripsit. He further observes this signal divine Judgment: Balaeus de Romans
Pontif. Actis, l. 5. p. 218. in Greg. 7. Ortuin. Great. Fasciculus, fol. 39, 40.
Usserius de Christianarum Ecclesiarum successione and statu, c. 5. p. 130.
Mo^ney Hist. Papatus, p. 256. record it likewise.
Vt primum ad excommunicandum Caesarem de sede surrexit, seeds ipsa noviter
lignis fortissimis composita, subito, Dei nutu, terribiliter scissa est in
plures parts: Vt manifest daretur intelligi, quanta sessor illa tam
periculosa excommunicatione et praesumptione, quamque terribilia schismata
seminaret contra Ecclesiam Christi, contra sedem Beati Petri, quam crudeliter
dissiparet Cathedram Christi, conculcando leges Ecclesiae, imperando cum
potentia et austeritate.

In descriptione ejusdem excommunicationis, ea interseruit in quibus manifest
a side Catholica erravit, cum injuste excommunicatum Imperatorem, and Episcopos
communicantes es, excepti ab excommunicatione tertio gradu communicantes eis,
and unitatem Ecclesiae scindens, quantum in ipso fuit, duas Ecclesias fecit.

Idem praesumptor, jejunium indixit Gara^nalibus, ut Deus ostenderet, quis
rectius sentiret de co-pore Domini, Romana ne Ecclesia, an Berengarius? per hoc
manifest probatus infidelis, cum in Niceno Concilio scriptam sit, quia dubious
in side, infi^elis est. Et de corpore Domini signum quae sivit, quod petente
biato Gregorio ad firmaend m^mulieris fidem contigit, quando p^nis Christi
formam accepit digiti. Et (...) duos Cardinales O^honem and Cunonem, ad Sanctam
Anastatiam, ut cum Suppone, ejusdem Ecclesiae Archipresbytero, triduanum
^eju^ium peragerent, and illis tribus diebus, singuli per dies singulos
Psalterium and missas decantarent, ut supradictum sigrum eis Chri^^us
ostenderet, quod minime contigit. They charged him likewise with this most
Atheistical and Treasonable conspiracy, to murder the Emperor in the midst of
his devotions in St. Mary's Church: The same is recorded by Abbas V^pergensis,
p. 223. Aventinus Annal Boiorum, l. 6. Barnes, Balaeus, Centur^ Magd 11. c. 8.
Schafnab^ ensis, and (...) others.
Imperator solitus erat frequenter ire ad orationem, ad Ecclesiam Sanctae
Mariae, quae est in Monte Aventino. Hiltebrandus autem cum per exploratores
su^s omnia c^us opera solicit inqui^eret, locum in quo frequentius Imperator,
vel staus, vel prostratus orabat, notari fecit; et quendam promissa pecunia ad
hoc induxit, ut supra trabes Ecclesiae occulte lapides magnos collocaret, et
ita aptaret, ut de alto super caput orantis Imperatoris demitteret, et ipsum
conterreret. Quod minister tanti sceleris cum festinares impl^re, and lapidem
magni ponderis super trabes aptare vellet, lapis pondere suo eum traxit, and
fracta sub trabibus tabula, and lapis and ille miser homo, Dei judicio in
pavimentum Ecclesiae cecidit, and eodem lapide contritus penitus est: (a just
divine retaliation.) Hujus rei gestrae ordinem postquam Romani cognoveruxt,
pedem illius miseri f^ne ligaverunt, and triduo per plateas Urbis ad exemplum
trahi fecerunt. Imperator autem solita clementia jussie cum sepeliri.

Johannes Portuensis Episcopus, qui intimus fuerat, and a secretis Hiltebrandi,
ascendit in ambonem brati Petri, and inter multa, audiente Clero and populo,
ait: Tale quid fecit Hiltebrandus et nos, unde deberemus vivi incendi:
significans de Sacramento corporis Domini, quod Hiltebrandus responsa divina
quaereus contra Imperatorem, (when he received no answer from this dumb Hostia,
and breaden God) fertur injecisse igni, contradicentibus Cardinalibus, qui
assistebant ei. (O horrid Impiery!)

In Pascha Domini feria secunda cum ad Ecclesiam Sancti Pet^i ad missam Clerus
and populus convenisset, post Evangelium in ambonem ascendit, sicut erat
indutus Pontificalibus indumentis. Et in praesentia Episcoporum and Cardinalium
in frequentia Cleri, and Se^atus populi Romani, public clamavit inter multa
suae divinationis verba, See Mathae^^ Parisiensis, An. 1080. Abbas V^pergensis,
Johan. Aventinus Annalium Boiorum, l. 5. Centur. Magd. 11 c. 8. Balaeus,
Barnes, Morney, and others forecited.
Regem Henricum usque ad proximum Sancti Petri festum sine dubio moriturum; aut
a Regno penitus dejiciendum, in tantum, ut ulterius non posset congregare quam
ser milites. Prae licavit etiam Episcopis and Cardinalibus, and omnibus qui
aderant de Ambone clamans, nullo modo habete me pro Papa ulterius, sed ab
Altari me avellite, si usque ad praedictum festum, Prophetia haec effectum non
habuerit. (To make good these his prophecies by his designed Treasons, of whose
success he was thus confident,) Eisdem diebus paravit Imperatorem perdere per
occultos proditores; Deus autem eum custodivit. Et eodem tempore fuerunt
nonnulli qui existimaveru^t, ipsum Hiltebrandum conscium extitisse, et
ordinatorem proditionis: quia eisdem diebus, paulo ante proditionem, de morte
Regis falso prophetate praesumpsit. Quod verbum vehementer percussit corda
multorum. Et palam factum est, Hiltebrandum voce propria in Conventu Ecclesiae
esse damnatum, qui (ut dictum est) judicaverat, se nullo modo esse Papam, neque
pro Papa ulterius habendum, sed proditorem et mendacem esse credendum; nisi
usque ad proximum festum Sancti Petri, Imperator moreretur, aut omni honor
spoliaretur, adeo ut ultra sex milites congregare non posset: et divino nutu
actum est, ut a seipso quoque damnaretur haereticus. Sic enim ait Apostolicus;
Dominus ipse inquit, Propheta qui arrogantia depravatus, voluerit loqui in
nomine meo quae ego non praecepi, ut diceret, aut ex nomine aliorum Deorum,
interficietur Quod si tibi tacita cogitatione responderis: Quomodo possum
intelligere verbum, quod Dominus non ost eloquutus? Hoc habetis signum, quod in
nomine (...) ^^opheta praedixerit, and non evenerit, hoc Dominus non est
locutus, sed per tumorem animi sui Propheta confinxit, and idcirco non timebis
eum.

Tempore autem transacto, quod Hiltebrandus in divinatione sua praefixit, Rege
vero neque mortuo, neque militibus suis imminuto, timens se suis verbis
deprehensum, and ore proprio condemnatum, ad calli^a argumenta se convertit,
persuadens vulgo indocto, non de corpore, sed de anima Regis se prophe^ass^,
quasi anima Regis milites omnes praeter sex (...) esset. Et his verbis vulgus
indoctum delusit. Contra hujusmodi Prophetas beatus Gregorius super (...):
Inter Prophetas ver^s and (...) ista (...) distantia, quia Propheta ver^^ quid
aliquando per suum spiritum dicunt, citius corrigunt: Prophetae autem falsi,
and falsa denunciant, and alieni a ^^^cto spiritu in sua fal^^tate perdurant.
(Moreover to evidence his Papal Justice) T^es homines (suspected to favor the
Emperors party) non convictos, non confessos ^osque secularibus judicibus
Hiltebrandus morti judicavit, and eos in patibulis juxta Ecclesiam Sancti
Petri, in loco qui dicitur Palatiolum, interfici suspensos coegit, sine
dilatione sine discussione contra leges, quae praecipiunt etiam manifestos reos
infra spacium and (...) ^riginta dierum non interfici. Quae etiam apud Paganos
vigent and servantur, sicut docet authoritas B. Ambrosu, and Pass^^ Sanctorum
Marcelliani and Marci.

See (...) Greg. 7. Cent. Magd. (...). c. 8. Sabellicus. Vo^ater^anus,

Martinus and others.
Cintium (...) praefecti Stepham, prius fidelem suum, in carcerem misit, and in
vase undique aculets vestito, mill and mill mortibus cruciavit. Qui postquam
evasit, (out of loyalty to the Emperor) ipsum Hiltebrandum coepit. De cujus
captione antequam evaderet, omnibus, qui captionis illius cooperatores fuerant,
hoc debitum public remisit, quod postea infideliter vindicavit, Cintium cui
omnia remiserat, persequi coepit, and novem de hominibus Cintii in patibulis
suspendio interfecit, ante portas Sancti Petri, etc.

Multa quidem aliafecit Hiltebrandus, in quem clamat sanguis Ecclesiae gladio
linguae ejus miserabili proditione effusus, propter quae, a communione ejus
justissime Ecclesia recessit, sicut fecerunt majores nostri temporibus
Apostatarum Liberii and Anastasii.

Hiltebrandus autem non solum Ecclesiae perturbavit pacem, sed etiam
Ecclesiasticam scidit unitaetem, and unicae fidei vestem inconsutilem: dum
Caesarem et Episcopos communicantes Caesari, absque judiciario ordine
excommunicabat, et tertio gradu communicantes eis, ab excommunicatione nova
pietate excipiebat; quos hujusmodi artibus, and Regi subducere, and sibi
allicere festinabat.

Dicant nunc Hiltebrandi discipuli, quibus commentis, quibus coloribus,
deaurare possint, quod ipse Hiltebrandus in Synodo generali haeretica
praedicavit, praedicando excommunicatis communicare consensit; praedicata
scripsit, praedicatione and scriptis alteram Catholicam, alteram
excommunicatorum Ecclesiam faciens, unitatem scidit, et scripta per orbem
terrarum disseminavit: praedicando, scribendo, scripta disseminando, seipsum
haereticum manifestavit, et ore proprio, et confessione haereseos non extorta,
divino urgente judicio condemnavit, dum vulgus erroneum Sanctum existimaret,
and Apostolis exaequaret spiritum tanti erroris, cum etiam prudentiores ejus
laqueis caperentur, and inducerentur in tentationem, si fieri posset, etiam
electi.

Mentimur, nisi tresdecim Cardinales sapientiores et religiosiores, ipse
Archidiaconus, Nota.
et ipse Primicerius, et multi alii Lateranensium Clericorum, quorum judicio ex
privilegio sanctae sedis totus subjacet mundus, Apostasiam ejus intolerabilem
perpendentes, ab ejus communione recesserunt.

Dicant oramus, Hiltebrandi discipuli, qua praesumptione Magister eorum
unitatem Ecclesiae in duas vel plures parts divisit? Si enim Caesarem injuste
et absque judiciario ordine damnavit, seipsum potius ab Ecclesia separavit. Si
vero just excommunicationis gladium in Caesarem, vel Episcopos communicantes
Caesari exeruit, quare communicantes ipsis Episcopis tertio gradu per
Scripturam excipiendo absolvit.

Gloriosus autem Hiltebrandus, and pedissequus ejus Cardinal Otho, afterward
Pope. Turbanus Hiltebrandi pedissequus.
Turbanus, nova potestate solventes decreta Chalcedonensis Concilii, non solum
verbis, sed and scriptis publicis consenserunt extra Ecclesiam communicare, and
baptizare: quam coesi essent, quam haeretici scriptis propriis deprehensi. Prob
nefas! ii praesumpserunt de Ecclesia judicare, qui Ergo Popes and Cardinals may
err.
nusquam reperiuntur non errasse; quibus etiam ipsa veritas reputatux in
mendacium, quam solo fallendi studio verbis et scriptis suis, ne venena erroris
eorum perciperentur, quasi mel veneficorum more admiscuerunt. Mendacium enim
est, ut beatus Augustinus ait, omnis enunciatio prolata intention fallendi.
Sileant Hypocritae, sicut ait beatus Petrus piratis similes, beati Petri nomen
igne malitiae sub nomine Catholico, sub obtentu justitiae artificiose
supposito, destruentes, et fere demergentes. Obstupescant Pseudo-prophetae ad
vocem Petri, in facie humani, in cauda scorpiones, lupi sub ovina pelle
latentes, corpora trucidantes in oris gladio, et animas pariter devorantes,
Benno his censure of Pope Hildebrands and his Successors Roman Religion.
QUORUM RELIGIO NIHIL ALIUD REDOLET QUAM PRODITIONEM ET AVARITIAM, penetrantes
domos viduarum captivas duxerunt mulierculas oneratas peccatis, sub occasion
impacati temporis attendentes spiritibus erroris and Doctrinis Daemonum, quas
accepit Hiltebrandus Magister eorum, a Magistris suis, a Theophylacto, qui
cognominatus est Benedictus Papa IX. a Laurentio Malasitano Archiepiscopo, a
Johanne Archipresbytero S. Johannis, de porta Latina, qui postea cognominatus
est Sextus Gregorius Papa. (Whose Magical Arts, Practices, Necromancies,
familiarity with, and Sacrifices to the Devil himself, he there at large
relates) Adding, Hiltebrandus a suis Militibus sine assensu Cleri and populi
est intronizatus; qualiter vixerit, qualiter a se Cardinales, qui testes vitae
and do^^rinae ejus esse debuerunt, removerit, quam miserabiliter vexaverit,
quantis haeresibus mundum corruperit, quanta perjuria quam immensas perditiones
consecraverat, vix a multis describi potest: clamat tamen altius sanguis
Christianorum ^o auctore et incentore miserabiliter effusus. So Benno
Cardinalis. Upon all which accounts he and others then renounced all Communion
with him.

An. 1079. Henry and Rudolphus fought another battle at Fladeheim, where
Rudolphus with his Saxons and other forces were put to flight: notwithstanding
the Popes benediction, and Henry's with all his adherents excommunications;

Sed nulli mirum sit Virum in rebus bellicis exercitatum and strenum tunc
fugisse; quia saepe justior and victrix causa, fortes in metum mittit et in
fugam. Henricus postea Saxoniam cum exercitu saepius ingressus, aut victor, aut
aequa manu recessit. Caesar fusis hostibus, (Anno 1080.) Osnoburgensem,
Virdunensemque Episcopos Romam cum mandatis proficisci jubet, postulatque a
Pontif. Maximo Ut siquidem secum sincere in gratiam redierit, tyrannum
immanissimum, perfidum, parricidam (qui affinitatis vinculo fideique religione
violata, bellum plusquam civil exercitaret, pacem interturbarit) pro
Republica, devoveat. Rudolphus quoque Romani Episcopi opem, cujus auspicio
regnare jussus sit, supplex implorat, petitque, ut Pontifex Maximus communis
generis humani parens, faedissimum sacrilegum, incestuosum, sacerdotum
contemptorem, cujus Deus venture, atque ea quae sub ventre sunt, sacro ense
jugulet. Gregorius hujus postulatis annuit, Hainricum quod contra atque
pollicitus fuerat, insignia Imperii usurparit, rursus execratur: Proceres,
populum, sacratos, prophanos Sacramento solvit, eos qui Caesari fidem frangant,
Principi suo rebellent, Rudolpho adhaereant, ab inferis emancipat, coeloque
locat; hisce incendia, caedes et hujusmodi scelera, quae bello designari
solent, indulget: aliis omnibus, qui Caesari fidem servent, ab eo deficere,
armis se miscere recusant, diras inferiasque dicit. Regem malum ob crimiua a se
devotum, proinde jam non Regem, neque illi parendum esse docebat, quin
obsequium praestare Deo, pietasque esse occidere eos qui Hainrico fidem
servarent, asseverabar. Sacerdotibus quoque connubiis interdicit, vetat populum
sacrificiis eorum interesse, aut illos pro Sacerdotibus ducere. Gratissima haec
fuere Scortatoribus, quibus pro una uxore sexcentas mulierculas inire licet.
Sed istaec omnia, plerisque Episcopis, aliis eruditis, simplicibus apertis
atque bonis, praeter conjuratos, qui suae causae serviebant, novum dogma,
pestifera haeresis, quae unquam Christianum conturbasset regnum, visa est.

The recited Speech, and manner of Rudolphus his death, much disparaging Pope
Hilbrands Antichristian cause, proceedings, and blasting his and his Prelates

for Hildebrand himself, thus branded then by all good, just, ingenuous,
openhearted, honest men, for the beginner, erecter of Antichrists Empire,
during his life; a Priest of Saxony in that age by special revelation gave the
world this account what became of him, and the two usurping Kings set up by him
against the Emperor Henry, after their deaths: Aventinus Annal. Boiorum, l. 5
p. 470.
Sacerdos expiranti similis triduo in Saxonia decubuit; is uti ad se rediit,
apud inferos Hildebrandum, Rudolphum, Hermannum tyrannos, aeternis mactari

leave them at present.

What unchristian effects, bloody civil wars, insurrections were occasioned
throughout Christendom by this Emperors dethroning, and setting up Rudolphus in
his stead, are thus recorded by one living in, or near that age; Apologet. de
Vnitate Eccles. p. 286. Edit. M. Frcheri: See, Aventinus Annal. Boiorum, l. 5.

Hac divisione facta, surrexit Rex adversus Regem, gens adversus gentem,
Episcopus contra Episcopum, populus contra populum. Exinde vero quantae caedes
factae sint hominum, quantae destructiones Ecclesiarum, quanta etiam rerum
confusio exinde facta sit in omni Ecclesia, indigere videtur Tragoedia magis,
quam historia. Magno se judice quis tuetur, dum uterque Rex just arma se
induisse arbitratur. Henricus scilicet, quod natus and nutritus in regno
successit progenitoribus suis in regnum ex Dei ordinatione, ac proinde
accepisse, juxta doctrinam Apostoli vindicem gladium in impios atque justos vel
Ecclesiae vel Reipublicae. Rudolphus autem, quod obediens, esse deberet
Pontifici sedis Apostolicae, qui per Episcopos partis suae praedicasset, eum
non teneri obnoxium perjurii vel perfidiae, si contra eum arma tulisset, qui,
utpote excommunicatus, Rex jam esse non posset: quum hoc sit, inquiunt, fidei
ac fidelium in Ecclesia, occidere, scilicet, et persequi eos quicunque
communicantes vel faventes excommunicato Regi Henrico, noluerint declinare post
partium suarum studia. Nova et inaudita est praedicatio hujusmodi, quoniam
Ecclesia non habet sibi concessum gladium, nisi spiritus, quod est verbum Dei.
Which warrants no such Hildebrandian Heresy as they preached.

The lawfulness and unlawfulness of the Popes excommunicating and deposing
the Emperor, was as hotly disputed in Rome by the Cardinals, and in Synods,
Pulpits, Schools by Bishops and Scholars, as it was by the Princes and Soldiers

Rudolphus, meeting at Triburiae (Friburg in Germany) where the Popes Legates
were present, justified Henry's Excommunication, refused all subjection to him
as their Lawful Sovereign, or any communion with him, being absolved by the
Pope from their allegiance to him, and he then ab Ecclesiae corpore propter

Aventinus relates, that Gerochus (quo nemo acrius scriptis libris Hildebrandum
tutatus est) tandem suae partis pertinaciam, ne dicam Tyrannidem, hisce verbis,
concta veritate notat; Romani (inquit) sibi divinum usurpant honorem, rationem
actorum reddere nolunt, nec sibi dici aequo animo ferunt, Cur ita agis? Illud
Sacyricum inculcant, Sic volo, sic jubeo, stat pro ratione Voluntas. He then
subjoyns, that as the Popes till then were confirmed by the Emperors: so
Hactenus, sanctissimi Patres, (quemadmodum Christus Dominus and Deus noster,
Comites, and Legati ejus fecerunt, and alios docuerunt) Caesares in terris a
Deo secundos, ante omnes mortales primos, a supremo numine datos, divinitus
constitutos, ab immortali Deo electos, and (ut illi vocant) Coronatos,
venerabantur; Dominosque suos vocare solebant. Eisdem tributum, censum non
denegabant; pro eorum salute quotidie comprecabantur. Imperata detrectantes,
tanquam coelesti provinciae resistentes, videri contra pietatem Christianam
fecisse decernebant. Grande nomen esse Imperatoris, a Deoque tradi
praedicabant; Reipub. turbellis, nedum armis, ut Milites Christi se non
immiscebant, paupertate and modestia cum caeteris Christian^s decertabant; quo
quisque submissius se gereret, hoc majorem esse sentiebant. Ensem ancipitem,
gladium duplicem, Christianae Civitati datum, ad servandum vivificandumque, non
occidendum esse putabant; eundemque spiritualem appellabant, qui est Sermo Dei,
vita and lux hominum, and mortuos ad vitam revocat; ex hominibus Deos, ex
mortalibus a ternos facit: tantum abfuit ut (...) vel regum quempiam, vel
impium, vel Arrianum regno pellere, eidem sacrificiis interdicere, populum
Sacramento solvere tentarent, atque regna evertere, sanguine humano se
polluere, pro principatu cum Christianis decertare, sibi permittant. Hildebrand
being the first who asserted the contrary.

J. Trithemius writes thus of this Emperor Henry's deposition by this Pope;
Ipse primus est inter omnes Imperatores per Papam depositus, Scholastici
certant, and adhuc sub judice lis est; Vtrum Papa Imperatorem possit deponere?
Quam quaestionem, cum ad nos non pertineat, indiscussam relinquamus.
Chronicorum lib. 6. cap. 35. lib. 7. in Prologo, p. 139
Otto Frisingensis Episcopus, writing of the change and diminution of the Roman
Empire, by this Emperors excommunication and deposition by Hildebrand, has
this memorable observation. Lego and relego Romanorum Regum and Pontificum
gesta, and nusquam invenio aliquem eorum ante hunc Henricum a Romano Pontif.
excommunicatum, vel regno privatum, etc. Sic and regnorum mutationes and ad
ultimu^ imminutiones, quis fructus sequatur, quia non sine gravi scandalo
dicere possumus, Deo apud quem nihil inutiliter effuere potest, relinquamus.
Non desunt tamen qui dicant, Deum ad hoc Regnum imminui voluisse, ut Ecclesiam
exaltaret: Regni quippe viribus ac beneficentia Regum, exaltatam, et ditatam,
nemo ambigit Ecclesiam; constatque non prius eam in tantum regnum humiliare
potuisse, quam ipso ob amorem sacerdotii eviscerato, ac viribus erhausto, non
ejus tantum, id est spirituali, sed suo proprio materiali scilicet gladio
percussum, destruetur: quod judicare, vel discutere, supra nostras vires est.
Videntur tamen culpandi Sacerdotes per omnia, qui Regnum suo gladio, quem ipsi
ex Regum habent gratia, ferire conantur, nisi forte David imitari cogitent, qui
Philistheum primo virtute Dei stravit, postmodum proprio gladio jugulavit.
Verum quia regno decrescente, Ecclesia (ut dixi) bravium aeternae patriae, ac
post vitae praesentis laborem, requiem adeptura, in praesenti quoque in magnum
montem crescens, in magna authoritate stare coepit, ea quae sequuntur,
praesertim cum ad nostra tempora recentemque memoriam ventum sit, tam defectu
rerum temporalium, quam profectu spiritualium, mundi contemptum prodentia, in
hoc opere dicenda restant. Nemo autem propter haec verba nos Christianum
Imperium ab Ecclesia seperare putet, cum duae personae in Ecclesia Dei,
Sacerdotalis and Regales esse noscuntur: memineritque nos supra dixisse a
tempore Theodosii senioris, usque ad tempus nostrum, non jam de duabus
civitatibus, imo de una pene, id est Ecclesia, sed permixta, historiam
texuisse. Quod temperamentum propter Haereticos vel excommunicatos ex regibus,
posuimus. Alios enim Christiana fide, etsi opera quae credant non sequuntur, in
Ecclesia secundum praesentem statum computandos esse, nemo qui sagenam Domini
malos and bonos continere scit, dubitat. Non enim discerni possunt in
praesenti, Ecclesia tantum quae manifesta sunt judicante. Deo solo qui novit,
qui sint ejus, cujus ventilabrum in manu ejus, merita singulorum pensante.
Porro Ecclesiam ecclesiasticas personas, id est Sacerdotes Christi, eorumque
sectatores, tam ex usu locutionis, quam consideratione potioris partis diximus;
non ignorantes, quod and ipsi si reprobam vitam duxerint, ad Civitatem Dei in
aeternum non pertinebunt. In the cloze of his Sixth Book upon this unpresidented
excommunication and deposition of this Emperor by Hildebrand, and its sad
effects, he thus descants; Otto ^risingensis Chron. l. 6. c. 35, 36
Hic quod supra distuli, solvendum puto, quod Romanum Imperium, ferro in Dan.
2. 40, 41, 42.
Daniele comparatum, pedes ex part ferreos, ex part fictiles habuit, donec a
lapide praeciso de monte sine manibus, excisum subrueretur, Quid enim aliud
(sine melioris sententiae praejudicio) lapidem sine manibus excisum, quam
ecclesiam capitis sui corpus, sine carnali commixtione ex Spiritu sancto
conceptum, and Virgin natum, ipsam quoque sine humana operatione, and ex
Spiritu and aqua regeneratam dixerim, etc. Hoc nimirum regnum circa finem suum,
quem pedes significant, ferreum propter Martem, fictile propter conditionem, in
ea part quae infirmior fuit, percussit: dum Regem Orbis, non tanquam Orbis
dominum vereri, sed tanquam de (...) per humanam conditionem factum (...),
gladio anathematis ferire decuit. Ipsa vero quae antea parva fuit and humilis,
in quantum Montem excreverit (under Hildebrand) ab omnibus jam videri potest.
Quanta autem mala, quae bella, bellorumque discrimina inde subsecuta sunt,
quoties misera Roma obsessa, capta, vastata, Quod Papa super Papam, sicut Rex
super Regem positus fuerit, taedet memorare. Denique tot mala, tot schismata,
tot tam animarum quam corporum pericula, hujus tempestatis turbo involvit, ut
solus ex persecutionis immanitate, ac temporis diuturnitate, ad humanae
miseriae infelicitatem sufficer (...) comprobandam. Unde a quodam Ecclesiastico
scriptore densissimis Egypti tenebris comparatur. Praedictus enim Pontifex
Gregorius a Rege urbe pellitur, Gibertusque R^vennatensis Episcopus in locum
ejus subrruditur. Porro Gregorius Salerni moriens, appropinquante vocationis
suae tempore, dixisse fertur: Dilexi justitiam and odi iniquitatem, prop^^rea
ma^ior in exilio. Quia ergo in Principe suo regnum ab Ecclesia pr^cisum
graviter percussum fuit. ecclesia quoque tanto pastore, qui inter omnes
sacerdotes and Romanos Pontifices praecipui Zeli, ac authoritatis erat, orbata,
dolorem non modicum habuit. Tanta mutatione, tanquam a perfectione ad defectum
vergente tempore, sexto Operi finem imponamus ut ad septenarium, requiemque
animarum, quae mis^^riam praesentis vitae subsequitur, Deo ductore properemus.

Hainricus perempto Rudolpho, pacataque Germania, secundo Italiam, ut aut in
gratiam cum Gregorio redeat, aut eum si pacem accipere detrecter, abdicet,
petit. Quicquid resistit, capit, perdomitat. Gregorius, Urbes, Castella, arces
communit, ad rebellandum Caesari hortatur. Verum is vi cuncta penetrat, hostium
munimenta expugnat, Romamque Victricibus signis pervenit. Quinquagenalibus
Castra ante Moenia urbes facit, fossa, vallo, carrucis munit, stativaque ibi
biennio habuit, urbem obsedit, neminem exire, intrare permisit circumcirca.
Universa incendus, caede complet. Hildebrandus fretus opibus Machtyldae, and
Ruperti Vischardi Nordmanni, portas urbis clausit, fortiter urbem tutatus est,
saepius eruptionem fecit. Hainricus in contraria part crebro urbem oppugnat,
Romanos erumpentes in urbem repellit. Extra moenia quicquid fuit, in ditionem
redigit. Tandem post annos duos quarto Nonas Junii anno ab Orb Vindicata
Millesimo Octogesimo tertio, urbs capta est: Romani cum supplices adsunt, auro
aegre pacem impetrant, perfidiam omnem in Hildebrandum transferunt, obsides
viginti dant nobilissimos cujusque liberos, quos Hainricus postulavit. Romani
deinde suasu Gregorii, Hainricum adeunt, orant ut diem Colloquio constituat,
ubi ipse and Pontifex Senatoresque conveniant, de rebusque Reipublicae summis
consilium habeant, bonorumque virorum arbitratu pax communiter confirmetur. Non
abnuit postulata Caesar, diem huic negotio destinat, etc. In the mean time the
Emperor returning from Rome by reason of the plague and new rebellions raised
by Hildebrand in Germany Call. Nov. ut conductum erat, Romam revertitur,
maximoque honor excipitur. Nuncii ultro citroque commeant; Gregorium and
Caesarem in gratiam redigere conantur. Gregorius and Caesar absque ulla
pactione, se atque Imperium fide illius permitteret postulabat. Caesari non
fuit consilium vitam, dignitatem, salutem suam atque amicorum, arbitrio
inimicorum in potestate acerbissimorum hostium credere, se ense suo jugulare,
manubrium ^e manu dimittere: Gregorius tamen simulata pace, fugae ornatu
dissimulato, Salernum ad Nordmannos aufugit, and qui omnes in periculum
impulerat, omnes in periculo deserit. Caesar coacto Procerum, Episcoporum
(...), advocata concione populi, more majorum, comitia Pontifica^ia havet;
Hildebrandus necessita^e in rationem versa, (...), Anno 1081.
tanquam lupus, fur ac latro, veluti perfidus transfuga, ovium desertor, gregis
proditor, christianae charitatis osor, vir sanguinum, omnium communiter

I shall render you a more particular account of Hildebrands, the Emperors, and
this New Pope Clements proceedings against each other, out of Bertoldus
Constantiensis, one of Hildebrands faction, living and writing in that age
Bertoldus Constantiensis, Presbyter; ad Hermannum Appendix, p. 350
Anno 1080. Gregorius Papa Synodum Romae, mense Martio collegit, ad quam de
Tentonicis partibus praedictae sedis Apostolicae Legati, redierunt, and
ommimodam Rudolfi obedientiam, and Heinrici inobedientiam, Domino Apostolico
renunc^averunt; unde ipse in fine Synodi Heinricum deposuit, ipsumque cum
omnibus suis fautoribus anathemizavit, et Rudlophum Apostolica authoritate in
Regia dignitate confirmavit. Unde, aemulus ejus congregata multitudine omnium
Schismaticorum sive excommunicatorum apud Brixinam legitimum Papam abjuravit,
and Guibertum Ravennatem quondam Episcopum, sed jam triennio a Papa Gregorio,
irrecuperabiliter depositum, and anathemizatum, sibi non in Papam, sed in
Haeresiarcham, elegit. Deinde apud Moguntiam conventu facto, eandem ipsam
electionem, a quibuscunque potuit confirmari fecit: (by his Imperial Sovereign
Ecclesiastical Authority;) He subjoyns, His temporibus Heinricus totam Italiam
adeo conturbavit, ut nullus secure ad limina Apostolorum posset ire, qui non
prius adjuraret, quod ad Papam Gregorium diversurus non esset.

Anno 1081. Heinricus post obitum Regis Rudolphi Veronam in Pascha venit, Anno
1081
and ^nde ad invadendam Romam, Ibid. p. 3^0.
cum suo non Apostolico, sed Apostata Guiberto, ut puta Domini Apostolici non
semel perjuro and anathemizato; profectus, sed macte reversus est. In the mean
time (as he relates) the Archbishops, Bishops and German Princes of Hildebrands
faction, made and crowned Hermannus for their King, by the Popes instigation.
Soon after;

Ibidem p. 350
Henricus Anno 1082. In Italiam assumpto Apostata suo Guiberto, Anno 1082
iterum Romam invisurus proficiscitur, adunata multitudine Schismaticorum,
ibique ea aestate moratus, pene incassum laboravit; nisi quod Milites suos
quibusdam castellis, ut facerent guerram Romany, imposuit, qui eum nec hac
vice Romam intrare permiserunt. Ignem quoque in domum Sancti Petri per quendam
traditorem immittere voluit, sed Dei misericordia protegente, non potuit.
Cogitavit enim ut de improviso, portus irrumperet, si Romani derelictis
propugnaculis, ad incendium restingendum concurrerent, unde ignem domibus
quibusdam Sancto Petro contiguis immitti fecerunt. Sed Dominus Apostolicus huic
versutiae obviavit. Nam primum viso incendio, omnes milites Romanos ad
propugnacula defendenda transmisit, ipseque solus fiducia Sancti Petri fretus,
facto signo Crucis contra incendium, ignem progredi ulterius non permisit.
Igitur Heinricus capto Venerabili Episcopo de Sutria, alliisque nonnullis,
suoque Apostata Guiberto in Tiburtina urbe ad infestandos Romanos derelicto,
ipse Longobardiam revertitur. Hermannus autem Rex multum de adversitate sedis
Apostolice dolens, eamque de manu Heinrici liberare volens, expeditionem in
Italiam paravit unde and de Saxonia in Sueviam venit; but was diverred.

Ibid. p: 351, 352. Anno 1083.
An. 1083. Iteram Heinricus cum multitudine Schismaticorum sive
Excommunicatorum ante Pentecosten Roman impugnaturus aggreditur: sicque
Guibertum Ravennatem, perjurum, depositum, and anathemizatum, apud S. Petrum
inthronizavit. non per Ostiensem, and Albanensem and Portuensem Episcopos, qui
hoc privilegium habent, ut and Papam consecrent: sed per Mutinensem and
Ariminensem Episcopos: utpote jam multis annis depositos and anathemizatos.
Statim ergo juxta sanctum Petrum quendam monticulum, nomine Palatiolum in
Castellum, eique milites multos, ut impugnarent Romanos, imposuit, qui eum
Transtiberinis urbis regiones, nullo pacto intrare permittebant. Multi tamen
jam ex Romany consenserant, partim pretio inducti, partim multis
promissionibus seducti, omnes autem aequaliter jam triennii impugnatione nimium
fatigati. Quid plura? omnes pene Romani, praeter Principem Salernitanum, hoc
laudaverunt, ut Papa Gregorius Synodum in medio Novembris colligeret Romae,
cujus Synodi statuta de causa Regni, nec Heinrico, nec Romany, imo nulli
penitus liceret praevaricari. Heinricus quoque ituris ad illam Synodum, and
redituris, securitatem jurejurando fecit. Unde et Papa omnes religiosos
Episcopos and Abbates ad Synodum literis suis vocavit. Heinricus (after some
stay at Ravenna) ad praedictam Synodum profectus est, quo and Legati
Teutonicorum principum ire debuerant, sed ab Heinrico in via apud forum Cassii
capti, and sedati sunt, circa festum sancti Martini, licet omnibus Synodum
illam petentibus securitatem juramento promiserit. Unde and Romani multa contra
Heinricum murmurare coeperunt. Erant autem religiosissimi Monachi and Clerici,
quos in captivitate fecit cruciari, (for stirring up rebellions against him in
Saxony and elsewhere) cum quibus and Ottonem venerandum Ostiensem Episcopum
captivatum, videlicet, ad ipsum ab Apostolica sede transmissum. Multi tamen ex
Francigenis ad illam Synodum, tam Episcopi vel Abbates pervenerunt. Meliores
autem Episcopi and Domino Apostolico magis necessarii, id est, Hugo
Lugdunensis, Anselmus Lucensis, Reginaldus Cumanus, specialiter a Heinrico ad
Synodum pervenire, prohibiti sunt: Dominus tamen Papa Synodum tribus diebus
solenniter celebravit, and ne Heinricum iterum specialiter anathemizaret, vix a
Synodo exoratus, omnes tamen excommunicavit, quicunque aliquem ad sanctum
Petrum, et Papam venientem impedirent, quoquo modo. Sed jam advenit terminus,
ad quem Romani, nesciente Papa, hoc Heinrico se effecturos juraverant, aut
Gregorius Papa eum incoronaret, aut alius quem ipsi illo expulso eligerent.
Quod juramentum licet in praeterita aestate factum fuerit, omnes tamen intimos
Papae usque ad terminum pene ^atuit. Adveniente ergo termino, Romani Papae de
juramento manifestaverunt, dicentes, se hoc jurasse, non ut Papa solenniter
regali unctione incoronaret, sed tantum simpliciter, ut ei coronam daret.
Annuit ergo Papa eorum votis, ut eos a juramento absolveret, viz. Heinrico; si
vellet cum justitia: sin autem, cum maledictione (note it) Coronam daret: Unde
Romani mandaverunt, ut veniret ad accipiendam Coronam cum justitia, si vellet:
Sin autem, de Castello Sancti Angeli per virgam sibi demissam a Papa reciperet.
Sed Heinrico utrumque recusante, alium Legatum illi direxere, qui eos bello
defenderet si necesse esset. Se been attendisse quid juraverint, nec se amplius
eo juramento detineri obnoxios. Igitur Domino Papae multo firmius, quam pridem,
consilio adhaesere. Sed jam septennio totum Romanum Imperium civili bello,
nimio schismatis dissidto, laboravit: aliis quidem Domino Apostolico, aliis
autem Heinrico faventibus, and ob hoc utrinque totum Regnum praeda, ferro et
igne miserabiliter devastantibus, paucissimi Catholici Episcopi ex part
Apostolici remanserunt, qui et a propriis sedibus expulsi, suis gregibus
providere non permittebantur. Quapropter, omnes pene religiosi, sive Clerici,
sive Laici, in aliqua Monasteriorum latibula hujusmodi mala declinaverunt: ne
videlicet devastationem sanctae Ecclesiae cernerent, cui in nullo adminiculari
possent. Satius enim illis videbatur, ut saltem seipsos, delitescendo
salvarent, quam pro aliis incassum laborando cum eisdem perirent.

Anno 1084. Reginaldus Cumanus Episcopus, Gregorii Papae adjutor studiosissimus
migravit ad Dominum, and Sigefridus Moguntiensis Archiepiscopus, Gregorio Papae
per multas tribulationes adjutor indefessus, requievit in pace. Heinricus
Aquileiensis Patriarcha, non semel Domino Apostolico perjurus and
excommunicatus, in corpore and anima moritur. In die Resurrectionis Dominicae
Heinricus a heresiarcha suo Ravennate, coronam, non gloriae, sed confusionis
accepit; Nam hujusmodi coronator, juxta attestationem sanctorum Patrum, non
benedictionem quam perdidit, sed damnationem, quam habuit, suo coronato
imposuit. Erat enim ipse Ravennas Archiepiscopus and omnimodam obedientiam
Romano Pontifici juravit, quam and nonnullo tempore fideliter exequutus est;
sed non multo post spreto juramento, singulari contumacia contra Apostolicam
sedem erigitur. Unde ab Apostolica sede and ab Episcopis totius Ecclesiae in
Romana Synodo post Canonicas inducias irrecuperabiliter deponitur, and
anathemizatur; nec hoc semel, nec in una Synodo, sed in omnibus Synodis
quotquot jam sexennio Romae celebratae sunt. Hic ergo in perjurio ita
inveteratus, and pro eadem saepius irrevocabiliter depositus and anathemizatus
(solittle did he esteem this Antichristian Popes frequent Anathemaes, or his
Synods) sedem Romani Pontif: cui obedientiam juravit, p^r.
pro manus Anathematizatorum, utpote sui stimlium, praeterito anno invasit,
legitimo pastore adhuc eidem sede praesidente: nempe Mutinensis and Aretinus
Exepiscopi cum reliquis excommunicatis eum ordinaverunt. Qui etiamsi Catholici
essent and Apostolica seeds Pastorem non haberet, nullum tamen eidem sedi
Pontificem ordinare possent. Hujus etiam ordinationis privilegium solis
Cardinalibus Episcopis, Ostensi, Albanensi, and Portuensi, a sanctis Patribus
est concessum, nec aliquibus aliis conceditur, ipsis hoc adimplere valentibus.
Sed hi libentius omnia extrema paterentur, quam tam sacrilegae ordinationi,
tanquam superbissimae praesumptioni miscerentur, quem et ipsi cum Domino
Apostolico Synodali judicio canonice damnarunt. Ergo Mutinensis and Aretinus
cum reliquis haereticis, Ravennatem illum, non in Romanum Patriarcham, quod
nullo modo potuerunt, sed in damnatissimum haeresiarchum promoverunt, ut quanto
altius inter ipsos emineret, tanto majoris damnationis privilegium possideret
(writes this Hildebrandian fury) Quapropter and Heinricus ab eodem incoronatus,
damnationem ejus haereditasse non dubitatur. Similiter and omnes quicunque
aliquid, quod a Domino Papa suscipiendum esset, a praedicto haeresiarcha quasi
susceptum, usurpaverunt. Chronicon Anno 1084. p. 225.
Abbas Uspergensis records, Imperator ipsis (Romany) petentibus, ut quia
Hildebrandus ab ipsis abdicatus, aufugerat, Wigpertum Ravennensem Episcopum,
eis Apostolicum praeficeret. xi. Kal. Aprilis feria 6. ante diem Palmarum
multis stipatus cum magna gloria intravit, ducens secum praedictum Episcopum.
Qui sequente Dominica per multos Episcopos Apostolico nomine dicatus, nomenque
Clementis accipiens, reverenter est intronizatus. A quo Rex cum Regina Bertha
in sancta Dominica Paschae imperiali dignitate sublimatus est. Ibidem
Bertholdus thus proceeds, Morabatur autem Heinricus in Lateranensi Palatio cum
Ravennate suo, nec a fidelibus Papae per Civitatem ad sanctum Petrum transire
permittebatur, sed in ipsa Paschali hebdomada fideles aggreditur, in qua
congressione 40. pene inter mortuos and vulneratos perdidit; nam reliqui
fugerunt: ex part autem domini Papae nec unus cecidit. A Papal pious
celebration of Easter by these Martial Popes, even in Rome it self. Pope
Gregory being overpowred at Rome by the Emperors forces, thereupon hired and
sent for Robert Wiscard to assist him. Hereupon Robertus Wiscardus Dux
Normannorum in servitium Sancti Petri post Calendas Maii Romam armata manu
invasit; fugato Heinrico, totam urbem Gregorio Papae rebellem, penitus
exspoliavit, and majorem ejus partem igni consumpsit, eo quod Romani quendam
ejus Militem vulneraverant. Deinde acceptis obsidibus a Romany, and in
Castello Sancti Angeli, quod domum Theodorici dicunt, reservatis, ipse ad
recuperandam terram sancti Petri reversurus, in brevi plurima Castella, and
Civitates Domino Papae recuperavit. Heinricus autem Roberto resistere non
valens, ad parts Teutonicorum satis festinanter revertitur. Bertoldi
Constantiens. ad Herman: Appendix, p. 355
Interim Henricus, congregata multitudine schismaticorum, VVecilonem Clericum,
Halverstatensis Episcopi fugitivum, Moguntinensi Episcopatu remuneravit, eo
quod illi in omni pertinacia contra Dominum and sanctum Petrum indefessus
cooperator adfuit. Qui ipse jamdudum anathemizatus, and ab anathemizatis
electus, nihilominus etiam ab anathemizatis juxta Pelagium Papam non
consecratus est: nam juxta beatissimos Patres, Innocentium, Leonem atque
Gregorium, nihil nisi damnationem and maledictionem a damnatis accipere potuit;
Dominus autem Papa collecta Synodo, iterum sententiam anathematis in Guibertum
haeresiarchum, et Heinricum, et omnes eorum fautores promulgavit; quod et in
festo sancti Iohannis Baptistae praeterito jamdudum Romae fecit, Anno 1085
cum Heinricus adhuc ibi moraretur. Hanc sententiam Legati sedis Apostolicae,
videlicet, Petrus Albanensis Episcopus in Francia, Otto Ostensis Episcopus in
terra Teutonicorum usque quaque divulgarunt. Qui cum in Alemannia moraretur
Sanctae Constantiensi Ecclesiae jamdudum viduatae, Catholicum Episcopum
ordinavit, scilicet Gebehardum Bertholdi Duci^ filium; hunc sane invitum, imo
multum ejulantem ac reclamantem, Constantiensibus Clericis et Laicis petentibus
and laudantibus, Episcopum consecravit.

Bertoldi Constantiensis ad Hermannum, Appendix, p. 355. See Abbas Vspergensis
Chronicon, Aventinus Annal. Boiorum, l. l. 5, Centur. Magd. 11. c. 10
Hermannus Rex Nativitatem Domini Gostare celebravit, ad quem praefatus
Ostiensis Episcopus post Epiphaniam pervenit in Saxoniam, and Colloquio
interfuit, quod Saxones contra Heinrici fautores condixerunt, ut hoc illis
probarent, se jure Henricum vitare ut excommunicatum: Quod and facto colloquio
decimo quinto die post Epiphaniam, fir^^ssime probaverunt, ea videlicet
ratione, quia Romanus Pontifex illum eis a se in Romano Synodo anathemizatum,
literis denunciavit. Adversarii autem eis objecerunt; quod Papa cum nequiverit
excommunicare, eo quod expoliatus non potuerit vocari, judicari sive damnari.
Ad hoc Saxones responderunt; Se judicium sedis Apostolicae nec debere
retractare, nec posse; hoc cum illo potius tractandum, qui illum damnaverit,
non cum Saronibus, quod damnationi ejus non interfuerint, qui sedis Apostolicae
judicio nullam retractationem sed obedientiam debuerint. Ita ergo soluto
colloquio (...).

Eo tempore Hildesheime^^s Episcopus cum suis sequacibus manus Saxonum vix
evasit, eo quod contra commune votum totius Saxoniae Henricianis se
admiscuerit. Pro eadem etiam culpa Comes Theodoricus eodem tempore occisus est
a nostrae partis fautoribus. Praeratus quoque sedis Apostolicae Legatus
praedicto Episcopo, cum nollec (...), officium penitus interdixit. Hermannus
Rex in Quintilineburg Pascha celebravit, ubi and Legatus Domini Apostolici in
ipsa Pascha^ hebdomada Generalem Synodum cum Archiepiscopis, Episcopis, and
Abbatibus sancti Petri fidelibus, solenniter celebravit. Interfuit autem huic
Synodo Gebehardus Reverendissimus Juvaniensis Archiepiscopus; Item Venerabilis
Hartungus Magideburgensis Archiepiscopus, cum Suffraganeis. Item Suffraganei
Moguntiae sedis de Saxonia, nam Wurceburgensis et Wormatiensis, Augustus
quoque, and Constantiensis de Alemannia, quique ipsi Canonica necessitate
impediti venire non potuerunt, per legationem suam se sancto Concilio
repraesentaverunt, seque per omnia ejusdem Synodi statutis assensuros,
mandaverunt. Rex etiam Hermannus cum suis Principibus eidem Synodo interfuit.
Cum ergo omnes juxta ordinem suum consedissent, prolata sunt in medium Decreta
Sanctorum Patrum de primatu sedis Apostolicae; (to wit, of Pope Hildebrand, and
some others of his Gang) quod nulli unquam liceat ejus judicium retrectare, et
de ejus judicio judicare. Quod de totius Synodi publica professione laudatum,
and confirmatum est: et hoc utique contra Heinricianos qui fideles Sancti Petri
constringere voluerunt, ut excommunicationem Domini Papae Gregorii super
Heinricum, cum illis retrectare praesumerent. Quidam autem Babenbergensis
Clericus, nomine Gunibertus, Romani Pontificis primati: derogare volens, in
mediam Synodum se contulit, asserens, Romanos Pontifices hunc sibi See Gratian,
Distinct. 22, 23 40.
primatum ascripsisse, non aliunde concessum haereditasse, videlicet, nullus de
eorum judicio judicare debeat, nec illi alicujus judicio subjaceant. Qui cum
aperte a tota Synodo confutaretur, praecipue tamen a quodam Laico convictus est
per illud Evangelicum, Joan. 13. 16. c. 15. 20.
Non est discipulus supra Magistrum; Cum enim hoc generaliter in omnibus
Ecclesiasticis ordinibus, observandum deputetur, ne major a minore judicetur,
quis hoc Vicario Sancti Petri denegare potuit, quem omnes Catholici pro Domino
and Magistro venerantur? (though Christ never made nor owned the Pope for his
Vicar, never excommunicated any Emperor, King, but submitted to their powers,
and censures too, as this Pope ought to do, not being above his Lord, by this
very objected Text) In eadem Synodo, ordinatio Wecilonis, Moguntini invasoris,
and Sigefridi Augustensis, and Notberti Curiensis imo omnes ordinationes and
consecrationes excommunicatorum, penitus irritae judicatae sunt, juxta decreta
Sanctorum Patrum Innocentii, Leonis primi, Pelagii, atque ejus successoris
Gregorii 1. Item Secta praedicti Wecilonis ejusque sociorum, sub anathemate
damnata est, See Avent. Annal. Boiorum, l. 5 Abbas Uspergensis, anno 1085. p.
225. Centur. Magd. ^1. cap. 10.
quae asserit, seculares suis rebus expoliatos Ecclesiastico non subjacere
judicio, nec excommunicari posse, pro suis excessibus; quaeque excommunicatos
absque reconciliatione recipi posse contendit. Statutum est autem ibi, ut
quicunque ab Episcopo suo, nec officio nec communione privato, excommunicatus
esset, etsi injuste, nullatenus tamen reciperetur ad communionem, nisi
absolutus Ecclesiastico more. Similiter and pro Sacrilegio excommunicatos,
decrevit sancta Synodus non recipiendos, absque solita reconciliatione, and
nisi dudum, quae sacrilege sibi vendicaverant, reddidissent, etc. In fine autem
Synodi sententia anathematis, cum ardentibus candelis promulgata est, in
Guibertum Haeresiarcham, sedis Apostolicae pervasorem, et in Apostatas sancti
Petri, Hugonem Aibanensem, Joannem Portuensem Exepiscopos, Petrum
Excancellarium, Item in Leomarem Bremensem, Vtonem Hildineshe^mensem, Ottonem
Constantiensem, Burchardum Basiliensem, Huzmannum Spirensem Exepiscopos, Item
in VVecilonem Moguntinum invasorem, Sigefridum Augustensem, Nortbertum
Curiensem, in hos inquam, and in omnes eorum Accomplices, inevitabilis sententia
anathematis promulgata est; only for their loyalty and obedience to Henry their
lawful King. Abbas Vspergensis, Chronicon, p. 225. Cent. Magd. 11 c. 10.
Aventinus Annal. Boiorum, l. 5.


Anno 1085. Synodus Moguntiae habetur, cui interfuit Imperator, ubi
praesentibus Legatis Romany, (to wit, of Pope Clements party) omnes Episcopi
rebels Imperatori, deponendi judicantur; caeteri vero anathemate, ut
videbatur, condemnantur. Ibi etiam communi consilio constituta est Pax Dei: Non
multo post substitutis ab Imperatore per parochias abdicatorum Praesulibus. In
locum Aldeberonis, Mainharans, Werciburgensis, Ecclesiae Praesul ordinatur, the
Emperor still retaining his ancient right of Investitures. Ad Hermannum,
Appendix p. 357.
Bertoldus Constantiensis, of the Hildebrandian faction, thus relates and
traduceth this Synods proceedings. Sed hi omnes adversarii Ecclesiae Dei, in
tertia hebdomada, post finitam Synodum, suam Moguntiae collegerunt, non
Synodum, sed Conciliabulum, in quo umbratilem sententiam excommunicationis,
contra fideles Sancti Petri deprompserunt, utpote ne quaquam illos
excommunicare valentes, sed apertissime seipsos a communione Catholicorum
sequestrantes, ut non tantum judicio sanctae Ecclesiae, sed et proprio eorum
judicio, sicut omnes haeretici, a Catholicis essent separati. Seeds quoque
Catholicorum Episcoporum viventium, temeraria cupiditate caecati, sibi
vendicare non timuerunt.

Deus autem omnipotens suis fidelibus per seipsum auxiliari non cessavit,
suumque judicium super inimicos sanctae Ecclesiae mirabiliter exercuit. Nam
totam pene Italiam, in qua potissimum furebant, tam magni fames obtinuit, ut
homines non tantum immunda quaeque, sed etiam humanam carnem manducarent. Quam
famem maudita mortalitas subsequuta est, ut nec tertia pars hominum remaneret,
sed deficiente Colono, maxima pars terrae in solitudinem redacta est. Padus
quoque fluvius Lo^gobardiae, ripas suas excedens, multa castella, villas, imo
circajacentes regiones penitus submersit, and inhabitabiles reddidit; Ipsa
etiam Capita schismaticorum eo tempore, heu misere abiere in locum suum,
videlicet Parmensis, and Rhegiensis Episcopi; Thedaldus Mediolanensis non
Archiepiscopus, sed Antichristus, Adalbertus and Reginherus Marchiones, and
Comes Boso, and alii innumerabiles, quorum factione tota pene Italia contra
Dominum Papam, and Sanctum Petrum se erexit. Hi quoque Mathildam (Hildebrands
Mistress) prudentissimam ducem and fidelissimam Sancti Petri Militem multis
injuriis af^ecerunt in Italia. Illis autem divina animadversione de medio
sublatis, ipsa suam potestatem recuperavit, et Sanctae Dei Ecclesiae in omnibus
adminiculari non cessavit, sicque ejus prudentia Mutinensi Ecclesiae and
Regiensi atque Pistorensi Catholici Pastores ordinati sunt, by mere force and
usurpation. Anno 207^


I have presented you with this large relation, how these two Popes Hildebrand
and Clement, the Hildebrandian and Imperial Councils, Bishops, parties,
excommunicated, execrated, deposed, slaughtered one the other, condemning each
others Doctrins, practices, Decrees as schismatical and haeretical: whose
judgments, because they may seem partial in their own cases, I shall acquaint
you with the resolutions of two Greek Fathers, living if not during, yet very
few years before Hildebrands antimonarchical Innovations and Positions. The 1.
of them is Oecumenius, Enarrat. in Epist. ad Romans c. 13. Parisiis 1547. f. 369,
370.
Oecumenius, or whoever else was the Collector of Enarrationes in omnes Pauli
Epistolas, attributed to him: The 2d. Theophylacti Opera Basileae, 1570, p.
37^, 375.
Theophylactus Bulgariorum Archiep. who in their Enarrationes in Epist. ad
Roman. c. 13. v. 1, 2, 3, (written about the years 1050, and 1075. seem
professedly to oppugn both his doctrine and practices; Both their Expositions
of St Paul's Text are the same in sense, if not in syllables, with little or no
variation: Omnis anima Potestatibus sublimioribus subdita sit, etc.] Postquam
abunde paravit mores auditorum, eosque docuit, ut hostibus essent benigni; hanc
etiam subjungit admonitionem; erudiens and instruens omnem animam, sive
Sacerdos sit quispiam, sive Monachus, sive Apostolus, (and Hildebrand was or
would be reputed all three) ut Magistratibus (or Principatibus as Theophylacts
translator renders it) subdantur. Nam haec subjectio non evertit, (or invertit)
pietatem. Admonet autem hoc Apostolus, ostendens; Quod Evangelium non doceat
defectionem, vel inobedientiam aut contumaciam, sed benevolentiam magis, ac
obedientiam. Magnam ubique capitis hujus rationem habet, ostendens, non ad
subversionem communis disciplinae Christi leges esse; quumque sufficientes
sint, veritatis causa bellum in Nos gerant; quid, inquit, necesse est nobis
ipsis superfluos procurare adversarios? Non est potestas nisi a Deo.
Principatus enim esse, and hunc quidem gubernare, alium vero gubernari, nec
omnia sursum ac deorsum ferri, divinae sapientiae opus esse dico, etc. Omnes
ergo potestates a Deo ordinatae sive factae sunt, quamcunque consideraveris;
sive patris erga filium, sive viri erga uxorem, sive alias omnes, etiam quae in
animalibus sint, puta apibus, grubus ac piscibus. Itaque quisquis resistit
potestati, Dei ordinatiom resistit. Ne abjecti viderentur Christi servi, si
Principibus subjicientur, ostendit, quod parere oporteat, et non inobedientes
esse Principibus; nam qui hoc facit, Deo resistit; qui Principatus constituit,
etc. Enforcing all St. Paul's reasons to this purpose, formerly pressed by
others in and from this Text; which no Hildebrandian shifts could ever yet
elude, or enervate, especially being written to all the Romans 1. 6, 7, c. 16 3,
4, 5, 7, 12, 15, 17, 18.
Saints, Church, Priests, Bishops of Rome it self, even whiles under Pagan
Emperors, Princes, Senators, who ought to pay as ample subjection, obedience in
all succeeding Generations to their Christian Emperors, as Paul, Peter
themselves, and all Saints, Bishops, Priests of Rome in their age, actually
did, and are here precisely enjoined to render to the very worst of their Pagan
Caesar's.

Besides Ale^iados, lib. 1. Edit. August. 1610. p. 31, 32.
Annas Comnenas, an ancient Greek Historian, writes thus ironically of
Hildebrands seditious practices; Iste vero execrandus Papa, cum spirituali
gratia, and Evangelica pace tota manu ac mente, princeps a^ bellum civil
progreditur, ille nimirum pacificus atque Pacifici discipulus; ad Saxonum enim
mittens Duces, ac tum alias multas eis conditiones offerens, tum etiam se
facturum eos Reges occidentis promittens, ita ad se viros allicit; usque adeo
facilem ac promptam habuit ille dextram ad ordinationem Regum: against St.
Paul's and Peter's forecited precepts, and presidents.

Neither did the Emperor Henry alone in that age exercise Dominion over his
Bishops, but the Sea Pietre de Pythou Pruvez. des Libertez de Leglise Gallicane.
French, Scottish, English Kings then did the like, (as I shall evidence in its
proper place) but the Kings of Poland too, though one of them then exceeded the
bounds of Justice and Christianity. For Cromerus de Rebus Poloniae, l 4.

Stanis^aus Sciepanovius, Bishop of Cracovia in Poland, in the year 1079.

vero acerbioribus monitis admoneret verbis, ut saevitiam, expilationes,
adulteria, luxum, et in rebus administrandis socordiam et ignaviam exueret,
tandem cum frustra saepius monuisset, anathematis vinculo eum astrinxit.
Whereupon, tulit haec justo aegrius Rex, and capta occasion, Episcopum in
Templo magna immanitate obtruncavit, discerptasque corporis portiones for as

Non tibi sacrilegae tunc cecidere manus?
Conscius itaque Bolestaus perpetrati facinoris poenitentia adactus, regno
relicto inignotas regiones profectus est, ubi in habitu peregrino vitam
clausit. Some write, that Sacris a Romano Pontifice (Gregorio 7.) interdictum
erat Polonia ob Stanislai caedem, till Wladislaus, Boleslai frater, Lambertum
Romam, veniam petendi causa, mittit; quem Episcopum designatum Cracoviae, re
feliciter simul confecta, ad suos remisit septimus Gregorius: Though Platina
and others make no mention of this Interdict or release thereof in Hildebrands
life; which I having so long insisted on; Take now this most favorable
relation of his death, from Bertoldus Constantiensis his pen: Ad Hermannum
Appendix, p. 3^7.
Sed jam Deus omnipotens famulum suum Gregorium Papam nolens diutius laborare,
imo pro laboribus suis digne remunerare volens, de hujus vitae ergastulo eum
vocavit. Nam aliquanto tempore graviter corpore infirmatus, sed in defensione
justitiae usque ad mortem firmissimus, Salerni diem clausit extremum. De cujus
obitu omnes religiosi utriusque sexus, and maxim pauperes doluerunt. Erat enum
Catholicae religionis ferventissimus institutor, et ecclesiasticae libertatis
strenuissimus defensor. Noluit sane ut Ecclesiasticus ordo manibus Laicorum
subjaceret, sed eisdem et morum sanctitate et ordinis dignitate praeemineret,
quod illum latere non poterit, quicunque ejusdem Apostolici Registrum
diligenter perlegerit. Postquam autem in gubernatione sedis Apostolicae, imo
totius Ecclesiae, duodecim annos and unum mensem legitime derertavit, tandem ex
hac luce, Anno incarnationis Dominicae 1085. Indict. Octavo 8 Call. Junii,
subtractus supernae vocationis (...) accep^sse non dubitatur, sepultus Salerni
in Ecclesia Sancti Matthaei, quam ipse eodem anno dedicavit. Sed Guib^rtus
haeresiarcha multum de obitu ejus laetabatur, licet parum prosperitatis suae
par^^^ eo lucraretur. Nam omnes Catholici post mortem Domini Apostolici non
minus quam ante, eidem Haeresiarchae restiterunt, ipsumque de Roma Ravennam
repedare compulerunt.

St. Briget of Sweden (canonized for a Saint by the Bulls of Pope Boniface the
9. and Martin the 5th. prefixed to her Revelations, l. 1. c. 41. printed
Nurembergi 1521. brings in Jesus Christ himself thus complaining of 5. sorts of
men, quia multipliciter offendunt me, the first whereof is the Pope, (what Pope
it was she intended, I cannot certainly define, unless it was this Hildebrand)
of whom Christ there thus complained; Nunc ego conquerror super te, Cap^t
Ecclesiae meae, qui seeds in se^emea, quam Petro and successoribus ejus tradidi
ad sedendum in ea, triplici dignitate ac authoritate. Primo, ut potestatem
haberent ligandi animas, and solvendi a peccato, Secundo, ut aperirent coelum
poenitentibus. Tertio, ut clauderent coelum maledictis and contemnentibus. Sed
tu qui deberes solvere animas, and ad me praesentare, tu vere es animarum
interfector. Ego eum institui (Petrum) pa^^orem and servatorem ovium mearum, Tu
autem es dispersor et lacerator earum. Tu autem pejor es Lucifero. Ipse enim
habebat ad me invidiam, and nullum concupivit occidere nisi me, ut pro me
dominaretur. Tu autem tanto deteriores, quod non solum occides me, removendo me
a te per mala opera tua, sed et animas occides per malum exemplum tuum. Ego
redemi animas sanguine meo, and commisi eas tibi tanquam amico fideli. Tu autem
tradis eas iterato inimico, a quo redemi eas. Tu es injustior Pilato, qui
nullum judicabat ad mortem nisi me: Tu autem non solum judicas me quasi nullius
Dominatorem, et nullius boni dignum, imo et animas innocents condemnas, et
nocentes dimittis. Tu es immititor Judah, qui me solum ven^^^dit, Tu autem non
solum vendis me, sed et animas electorum meorum, pro turpi lucro tuo et vano
nomine. Tu es abhominabilior Iudaeis: Ipsi crucifixerunt corpus meum solum; Tu
autem crucifigis et punis animas electorum meorum, quibus malicia tua et
transgressio amarior est omni gladio. Et ideo, quia tu similis es Lucifero,
injustior Pilato, immitior Judah, abhominabilior Iudaeis, ideo merito conqueror
super te. After which she there brings in Christ himself, by S. Peter's advice,
passing this sentence against the Pope; Haec autem est vera justitia, ut primus
qui sedet in sede tua, et opera habet Luciferi, amittat cum contemptu sedem in
qua praesumpsit sedere (as Luciferian Pope Hildebrand did) et particeps sit
poena Luciferi: Then she introduces Christ himself swearing thrice by God the
Father, his own body, and the holy Ghost, quod faciam justitiam super hos: and
passing this memorable Judgment upon the Pope, his Ministers, Members, Vicars,
adhering to him, Gladius meae severitatis in corpus tuum intrabit, qui a
superiori capitis ingredietur, et sic profunde et valenter infigetur, ut
nunquam extrahatur. Seeds tua mergetur quasi lapis ponderosus, qui non
subsistat antequam venerit in novissimum profun^i: Digiti, id est, assessores,
ardebunt igni sulphureo et inextinguibili: Brachia tua, id est Vicarii, ad
animarum profectum extendi deberent; sed extenduntur ad utilitatem mundi et
honorem; judicabuntur poena quam dicit David; Piant filii ejus orphani, and
uxor ejus vidua, and alieni recipiant substantiam ejus: Quae est uxor ejus nisi
anima? quae relinquetur a gloria coelesti, et erit vidua Deo. Filii ejus, id
est virtutes quas habere videbatur, and simplices mei qui sub ipsis erant,
separabuntur ab eis, and dignitas eorum and bona ad alios devolventur; et ipsi
pro dignitate aeternam confusionem haereditabunt. Deinde The Popes triple Crown
and Miter.
ornatus Capitis eorum demergetur in lutum inferni, a quo nunquam consurgent:
Vt sicut hic per honorem et superbiam super alios ascenderunt, sic in inferno
prae aliis demergentur ita profunde, ut impossible sit eis resurgere. Let all
proud Popes chew the cud upon it.

qui et Gregorius, nunc in extremis positus, ad se vocavit unum de xij.
Cardinalibus quem prae caeteris diligebat, et confessus est, Deo et Sancto
Petro, et toti Ecclesiae, se valde peccasse in Pastorali cura, quae ei ad
regendum erat commissa, seque suadente Diabolo, contra humanum genus iram Dei
et odium concitasse. Postea vero sententiam quae in orb terrarum effusa est,
pro augmento Christianitatis revocasse, dicebat. Tunc demum misit praedictum
Confessorem suum ad Imperatorem, et ad totam Ecclesiam, ut opraret ei
indulgentiam, quia finem vitae suae aspiciebat; et jam cito induturus erat
angelicam vestem: et dimisit et dissolvit vincula omnium bannorum suorum
Imperatori et omni populo Christiano, vivis et defunctis, Laicis et Clericis,
et jussit suos abire de domo Theodorici, et amicos Imperatoris ascendere.

first visible founder, erecter of that Antichristian Papal Sovereignty and

attempted to excommunicate, depose, interdict the Roman Emperors, give their
Crowns, Kingdoms to others; to absolve all their subjects from their Oaths of
Allegiance to them, and excite Subjects to rebel and take up arms against
their rightful Kings, to dethrone them, for not obeying their Papal Decrees.
2ly. Because he was the chief contriver (before and after his intrusion into
Peter's pretended Chair) how to deprive the Roman Emperors of their ancient
hereditary Sovereign Ecclesiastical right of electing, ratifying, investing,
confirming Popes, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops; and to defraud, robb all
other Christian Kings, Princes, Nobles, Lay-Patrons of their Patronages,
Presentations, Collations to Bishoprics, Benefices, or any other
Ecclesiastical dignities, under the false pretext of Simony, Heresy,
Sacrilege, Idolatry, wherewith he branded it, on purpose to monopolize the
sale and disposal of them to himself and his Successors, to make all Platina,

Bishops, Clergymen, and Religious Orders sworn Vassals, Feudatories, Votaries,
Servants to, and sole Dependants on the Sea of Rome, but perfidious Traitors,
Rebels to their own natural Kings, Princes, as exempted from, and having no
Dominion over them, nor engagements to them. 3ly. Because he was the first Pope
who violently persecuted married Priests, prohibiting all Laymen to hear their
Masses, etc. unless they were totally divorced from their wives in obedience
to his Papal Decrees.

Which Antichristian Usurpations, Innovations of his being the Original ground,
president of all his Successors intolerable Encroachments on, proceedings of
like nature against our English Kings, and their Sovereign Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction; and the Emperor Henry's oppositions against him and his
encroachments, a grand encouragement to our Kings vigorous oppositions against
his successors usurpations of like nature in England; (the chief Subject of my
ensuing History;) I deemed it not only expedient, but absolutely necessary, to
present the world with a full and faithful Narrative of his Hildebrandian
Antimonarchical Sentences, Decretals, Proceedings; the opositions made against
them, which have ever since infested all Christian States, Churches, with high
contests, schisms, wars between the Crown and Miter: And before I procceed to
his Successors, I shall give you this further Account of these 3. particulars,
beginning with the Original ground of the quarrel, Investitures and Simony.

formerly discovered how some of Hildebrands immediate Predecessors (by his
advice and instigation) made several Decrees, Constitutions against Clergy-mens
receiving Investitures, or Presentations to Bishoprics and Ecclesiastical
Benefices from Laymens hands, under the false odious crime of Simony, to
render it detestable to the ignorant vulgar, which produced little or no
effect, till Hildebrand himself, as Legate to Pope Stephen the 9th. and others,
put them in vigorous execution, Chron. Antonini Tit. 16 c. 1. Sect. 21

Simo^acks, which he more violently prosecuted after he became Pope. Hence our

Episcoporum; In quo primo ipsum Henricum excommunicavit Imperatorem, tanquam
perjurum et Ecclesiae Dei persecutorem et subversorem. Anathematizaverunt autem
insuper, omnes Ecclesiasticas personas qui de manu alicujus secularis personae
acciperent Investituram, et omnes Simoniacos anathematizavit. Inde grave ortum
est scandalum: ita ut nullius Haeresis tempore Ecclesia Occidentalis graviori

Simonia non declinabant. Aliis notam avaritiae honesto nomine praetexentibus,

Montano dicit Eusebius) sub nomine oblationis artificius munera accipiunt.

De Gestia Regum, l. 2. c. 3. p. 84
William of Malmsbury records that Hildebrands Predecessor Gregory the 6. in an
Oration to his Cardinals at Rome, (when being sick and likely to die, ausu
temerario persuaderent, ne se in Ecclesia Sancti Petri cum caeteris Apostolicis
tumulari praeciperet, qui tot hominum mortibus officium faedasset;) used this
expression to them concerning investitures. Laudatus est olim praedicandae
memoriae praedecessor noster Adrianus primus, quod Investituras Ecclesiarum
Carolo Magno concesserit, ita ut nullus Electus consecraretur ab Episcopo, nisi
prius a Rege insigniretur annulo et baculo. Contra, laudatur in seculi nostri
Pontificibus, quod has donationes tulerunt Principibus, Poterat tunc
rationabiliter concedi, quod nunc laudabiliter debet auferri. Cur ita? Quod
erat animus Magni adversus avaritiam invictus, nec facile invenisset aditum
aliquis, nisi intrasset per ostium. Praeterea, per Does not the same reason
still remain?
tot terrarum insterstitia nequibat requiri seeds Apostolica, ut unicuique
electo accommodaret assensum suum, dum esset prope Rex, qui nihil per avaritiam
disponeret, sed juxta sacra Canonum scita religiosas personas Ecclesis
introduceret. Nunc omnia Palatia Regum, luxus and ambitus occupavit. Quare
merito libertatem suam sponsa Christi asseverat, ne illam Tyrannus ambitioso
usurpatori prostituat. Upon which pretexts, Pope Hildebrands made these
Decrees, to rob Emperors and all others of Investitures, that Popes alone might
enjoy the sales of all preferments.

grand Champion of the Popes Supremacy) thus complains, De Planctu Ecclesia lib.

Mundet igitur Dei Vicarius Curiam suam consuetudinibus Simonaicis, quia ad

lucrentur pecunias: unde in una ordinatione lucrabitur ibi Episcopus, nunc per

Popes, Cardinals, and Bishops, which you may there peruse at leisure.

Imperio, sic hodie in Romana Curia, est vorago divitiarum turpissima; crevit
avaritia, periit Lex a Sacerdote, and visio a propheta, and consilium a

Venite, and invenietis requiem animarum vestrarum; clamat, Venite ad Curiam

vestrarum: Sic enim clamat exemplo et facto. Ecce Roma nunc est Vorago et
mammon inferni, ubi Diabolus totius avaritiae Capitaneus residet. vendens
Patrimonium Christi, quod sua passione nobis promeruit: qui nobis praecepit, ut
gratis demus, quod gratis acceperimus. Idcirco versum est in Proverbium; Curia
Romana non petit ovem sine lana: Dantes exaudit, non dantibus ostia claudit. In
Curia Romana residet superbia maxima, cupiditas insatiabilis, luxuria mihi
(Christo) execrabilis, ac etiam vorago pessima horribilis Simoniae. He adds,
cap. 13. sect: 28.
Sylvester secundus, per Simoniam et Magicam artem Pontificatum est consecutus.
(Since which time) ultra quingentos annos usque modo ex divina permissione
solutus est Satanas, qui suas malas immissiones non solum in adversarios
Ecclesiae, id est infideles, sed etiam in ipsius Ecclesiae membra, id est, in
Christianos reprobos effundit, operando in eis fallacias, and novas and
inuntatas machinationes and oppressiones. Cap. 15. sect. 32.
Plerique contra Ecclesiastica Statuta in Pontifices Simoniace electi,
ambitiose intrusi, and aliquando in tantum vitiati fuerunt, quod rursus ab
Ecclesia rejecti, e sede expulsi, damnatique sunt, ac interdum propter suos
defectus manifest a Deo percussi. Cap. 20. D^ Excessibus Praelatorum: and cap.
21. De Praelatorum altorumque Curatorum vita vitiosa, he thus complains: O
quanta nunc est obduratio ab Ecclesia Dei! Communiter ad Praelaturas intrant
Simoniaci. Praelati sunt superbi, vani, pomposi, simonaici, avari, luxuriosi,
ambitiosi, aut aliter vitiosi, etc. taking their president from Popes
themselves. And cap. 25. sect. 9. Simonia contra Canonum Decreta in Clero jam
ubique regnat. A minori usque ad majorem omnes Clerici avaritiae student, Qui
dicunt, aquam nostram, id est donum Spiritus sancti pecunia bibimus, hoc est
Simoniace administramus sacramenta Dei: ideo subjungitur: Linguam nostram
pretio comparavimus, etc. Et tamen ad majoris damnationis cumulum illam
Simonaicam pravitatem ex inveteratae consuetudinis jure, quidam malitiose
defendere nituntur, qui cum Giezi and Simone condemnabuntur.

I shall cloze up this Discourse concerning Hildebrands and other Popes Decrees
against Investitures and Simony, with these memorable passages of Claudium
E^pencaeum in Epistolam Pauli ad Titum, Parisiis, 1568. p. 71, 72.
Claudius Esspencaeus, (a learned Popish French Bishop) in his Commentary upon
Paul's Epistle to Titus; wherein he complains, that Popes and Popish Councils,
instead of the long expected and promised reformation of the scandalous sin
of Simony, tot omnibus votis expectatum, atque a Paulo 3. viris doctissimis
atque gravissimis delectis, delegata; who found and informed him, Ejus
Sanctitatem hodiernorum malorum inde principium esse; quod Praedecessores ejus
nonnulli prurientes auribus coacervaverunt sibi Magistros ad desideria sua, non
ut a quibus discerent, quid facere deberent, sed quorum calliditate inveniretur
ratio, qua liceret, quod liberet. Hinc effectum, ut prodirent adulatores potius
quam Doctores, qui docerent, See Antonii de Rosellis Monarchia pars 2. cap. 15.
Papa beneficiorum omnium esse Dominum; ac ideo cum Dominus jure vendat id quod
suum est, necessario sequi, in eum non cadere Simoniam: Ex hoc Simoniam in

font tot in Dei Ecclesiam abusus, et gravissimos morbos irrupisse, quibus ad
salutis ea desperationem fere laboret, et quorum fama ad infideles usque
damnet. Hanc praecipue ob causam Christianismum deridentes atque blasphemantes.
Non licere ergo nec Christi Vicario in usu Clavium, sive potestatis, ab eo illi

He then observes, that from the gross notorious Simony of Popes, and their
open, shameless sales of all sacred things, yea sales of Dispensations, for all
detestable sins, all other Bishops, Clergymen, and their Officials, openly
practiced this gainful Trade of Simony. Ibid. page 66. 67, 68, 74, 75. Vide p.

England make the like just complaint?) plerunque, dum Diocaeses and Parocecias

incestos cum affinibus aut consanguineis, denique contra naturam cum brutis,
etc. Habeat jam Roma pudorem, et tam nullius frontis criminum omne genus
Catalogum prostituere desinat. These were the fruits, designs of Pope
Hildebrands decrees against Simony, that he and his Successors might be the
sole Merchants of all Ecclesiastical Preferements, Indulgences, Pardons, Sins
and universal Simoniacks in and over the Church of Christ.

All which (with other historical passages hereafter cited) duly considered, it
will appear most just, rational, advantageous for the Church of Christ, that as
the Investitures, Donations, Collations of the Papacy it self, all other
Bishoprics and Ecclesiastical Benefices, did anciently of right belong to
Christian Emperors, Kings, Princes, till forcibly wrested out of their hands by
Popes and Popish Prelates: so they should in all Realms henceforth resume,
perpetuat the^ in their hands; not in Popes, Bishops or Clergymens, who have

In Gallia vice Papae praesederat concilio, ibique plures Episcopi, olim per
Simoniam in Ecclesias introducti, degradati potioribus locum dedere. Unus erat,
quem suspitio istius Apostasiae insimulabat, sed nullis testibus argui, nullis
argumentis confutari poterat: quem cum putares constrictum maxim, more anguis
lubrici elapsum mirarers, ita dicendi art callebat, ut omnes eluderet. Tunc

Scimus profecto quod Episcopalis gratia Sancti Spiritus munus est, and quisquis
Episcopatum mercatur, Sancti Spiritus donum posse comparari pecunia opinatur.
Coram nobis ergo, qui Judicio Spiritus sancti congregati sumus, dicat iste,
Gloria Patri, and Filio, and Spiritui sancto: quod si express, and sine
titubantia dixerit, constabit apud me, illum non venaliter, sed legitime
praesulatu functum: Libens hanc conditionem ille accepit, nihil minus quam
horum verborum difficultatem ratus; and vere, Gloria Patri and Filio, integre
protulit, sed in Spirtu sancto, haesit. Suscitato cunctorum strepitu nullo
conatu vel tunc, vel in reliquo vitae spatio Spiritum sanctum nominare potuit.
Hujus miraculi testis fuit Abbas saepe nominatus, qui dejectum Episcopum per
loca secum ducens, illius rei experimentum saepe risit: de quorum verborum
certitudine dubitantem, omnis Europa confutat, quae Cluniacensis religionis
numerum, per eum augmentatum non nescit. If this relation, upon the Abbot of
Clungy his reputation be true, I doubt this Pope with Si omnes pro Simoniacis
and haereticis fuissent damnandi and ex Ecclesia excommunicandi, qui gradus,
aut functiones ecclesiasticos pecunia emebant, vel vendebant, nulli pene hujus

committere Simoniam, quia possit bona ipsius Ecclesiae tollere and Ecclesiam.
Item nec pecunia quam reciperet pro praestando gratiam spiritus sancti, vel pro
praestatione sacramentorum, quia cum possit ab Ecclesiasticis, suadente
necessitate, pecunias exigere; non erit judex qui possit vel debeat judicare,
utrum pro alienatione gratiae spiritus sancti acciperet, aut ex alia causa,
quia Papa a nemine judicatur. Concluding positively: Quod quamvis Simonia sit
peccatum gravissimum, pro ipsa tamen, vel pro quocunque alio crimine
quantumcunque gravissimo, Papa non potest ab alio judicari, vel propter
delictum deponi, etiamsi delictum soret notorium scandalizans Ecclesiam.

to prevent the Emperors and other Kings punishing and reformation of these
abuses, they exempted all Clergymen from their Tribunals, and the accusations
of Laymen, decreeing, that no Cardinal should be convicted, condemned of
adultery, whoredom, etc. but by 72. witnesses, no Cardinal Priest but by 64. no
Cardinal Deacon or Bishop but by 24. nor Subdeacon or Cardinal of inferior
degree, nor Bishop but by 7. witnesses at least. And those would be more than
impudent, who durst commit whoredom, adultery, or sodomy in the open view of so
many Priests or Clergy men; or yet of Laymen, though disabled to accuse them by
their Canons.

Et postquam omnes eleganter informasset, and informando ex part Dom. Papae and

thus publicly uttered by the Cardinal in the Pulpit, before the Pope himself,
his Cardinals, Court, Clergy, and all the Citizens summoned to hear his Farewell
Sermon, preached by the Pope's appointment, and in his name, right, was
certainly an unquestionable though satirical truth, That the Pope, his

Hildebrandian Decree against theirs wives. Sequitur Apoc. 18.) De Planctu

Et custodia omnis spiritus immundi, quia intra Ecclesiam omnia peccata
inveniuntur hodie, quae immunda dicuntur, quia immundam faciunt animam, maxim
spiritus immunditiae fornicationis. Quis enim Clericorum intra sanctam
Ecclesiam castitatem servat? rarus est. Perpauci enim hodie sunt Presbyteri,
maxim in Hispania and regno Apuliae, quin sunt publici Concubinarii. Episcopi
and Presbyteri nimis incontinenter vivunt, and utinam nunquam continentiam
promisissent, maxim Hispani and Regricolae, in quibus Provinciis in pauco
majori numero sunt filii Laicorum quam Clericorum. Et (quod sceleratius est)
per plurimos annos de latere concubinae qualibet die surgunt, non praemissa

Ecclesiastical Authority, to suppress when they could not reform these

cannot defile or incapacitate any of his posterity, to be a Bishop, Priest or
Minister of God.

the first institution of Matrimony; and to Noah and his Sons after the stood;
Gen: 1. 27. c. 9. 1.
Increase and multiply, and replenish the earth, by the use of lawful
Matrimony; extended to Adam, Noah, and all their Posterity in succession to the
end of the world; (and that as a special privilege and benediction, not a
curse; it being a Genesis 11. 30, etc. c. 15. 2. c. 25. 21. c. 29. 3. c. 30. 3. 1 Samuel 6. 23. Jer. 22. 30.
curse to be childless, but a Genesis 17. 5, 6. c. 23. 5. Ps. 113. 9. Psalm. 127.
3. Psalm. 128. 3, 4, 6.
blessing to have children, posterity, as the Scripture often resolves.)
Therefore to Priests, Clergymen, they all being Adam's and Noah's posterity,
as well, as much as others, and so not to be debarred from this special
blessing.

3ly. That See here, p. 2, 3, 4. Genesis c. 5, and 10. throughout.
Adam himself, and the first born, Patriarch of every Family, during the law of
Nature, even from Adam's creation till the institution of the Levitical
Priesthood, were the only Priests and Ministers of God to offer Sacrifices,
instruct their Children, Families in the fear and worship of God, to bless
them, and pray for them: Now these were 1 Chronicles. c. 1, and 1, and 2, etc. Mat.
1.
married to propagate Mankind, perpetuate Posterity, and the Church, by God's
own precept, without the least restraint or any impediment at all to their
primitive Priesthood; Therefore Priests may be so too under the Gospel.

4ly. That Exodus 6. 23, 25. c. 27. 2. c. 28. c. 29. 4, 9, etc. c. 30. 30.
Levit. c. 1, and 2, and 3, etc. Number. c, 3, and 4. 1 Chronicles. c. 6, and 23.

7. 5. Hag. 1: 12, 14. c. 2. 2, 4. Lu: 1: 5, 24.
Highpriests succeding him, who were types of Christ himself, and Hebr. 9. 6,
7, etc.
entered once a year at least into the Holy of Holyes, were all married, having
Wives and Children: That the other Levit. c. 1, and 2, and 3. 1 Chronicles: c. 6,
and 23, and 24. throughout.
Levitical Priests, Levites and Church Officers under the Law, were all
married, or permitted freely to marry without restraint, being Highpriests,
Priests, Levites only by descent and succession in the self-same Tribe, not by
election and mere ordination; God himself prescribing what Levit. 21. 1, 7, 9,
to 16, 24.
Persons they should marry, and what not; their Wives, Marriages, Children, no
ways disabling or hindering them from the execution of their Priestly Offices,
as the Scriptures abundantly evidence. Yea the Prophets likewise had both 2
Kings 9. 1. Amos 7. 14. Ezech. 24. 8.
Wives and children under the Law; therefore all Bishops, Priests, Prophets,
Ministers under the Gospel, by parity of reason may, or ought to be married,
and to enjoy their Wives, Children without any impediment to their Ministry:
There being no divine inhibition to the contrary, as Clemens Alexandrinus
Stromatum. l. 3. and 7. long since resolved.

5ly. That John 22 1, to 12.
Christ himself, under the Gospel, with his Mother and Disciples honored
Marriage not only with their presence at it, but by Christ's working his very
first Miracle, in turning water into Wine, to adorn this Solemnity, and
manifest his glory thereat.

6ly. That Christ in the Mat. 19. 1, to 10. Mat. 10. 2, to 13.
Gospel, not only, not repealed, but approved, ratified the use of Marriage
according to its primitive institution at the creation, which he rehearsed,
reducing the Jews unto it, who had swarved therefrom: adding this farther
divine seal and codicil thereunto; What God has therefore joined together, let
no man put asunder. By which he justified its use, lawfulness under the Gospel,
to be as universal, extensive, free from the least restriction in relation to
Priests, as it was at the Creation, and before his incarnation, and prohibits
See Gratian Distinct. 37.
Priests divorses from their Wives, by any human or Papal Roman Canons
whatsoever.

7ly. That it is evident both 1 Cor. 9. 5. Mat. 8. 14. Mar. 1. 30. Lu. 38. Mar.

Fathers, that the Apostle Peter himself, James, Philip the Evangelist, all
Christ's Apostles except Saint John, yea St. Paul himself were married, and had
Wives, without any reprehension, restraint from Christ, or disability to
exercise their Apostolical, Episcopal or Ministerial functions. Therefore all
other Evangelists, Bishops, Elders, Priests, Deacons, may lawfully and laudably
marry, without prejudice to their Spiritual functions, as well as they: as
sundry godly See Bishop Jewels Defense of the Apology, 2 part, cap: 6. p. 207,
208, etc. Bishop Halls honor of the married Clergy.
Bishops, Priests, Deacons, and several Popes too married and had Wives in the
primitive Ages of the Church, for many hundred years after Christ, (as they
ever had and still have in the Greek Churches) till, yea after Hildebrands
time, when they were by force and absolute tyranny divorsed from them.

8ly. The Spirit of God resolves by Paul himself, That Hebr. 13. 4.
Marriage is honorable to ALL (whether Male or Female; Popes, Bishops, Monks,
Priests, Clergymen of all sorts, as well as others) and the Bed undefiled.
Therefore to all Popes, Bishops, unmarried Priests, Votaries, unless they will
deny themselves to be comprised under the universal word All, and make
themselves Beasts or Angels. But Whoremongers and Adulterers (as See John Bales
Acts of English Vota^ies. The Anatomy of the English Nunnery at Lisbon.
most unmarried Prelates, Priests and Romish Votaries have been, and still are)
God will judge.

9ly. God himself by the Truth inspired hand, pen of Saint Paul, gives this
universal advise, if not precept to every man and woman, 1 Cor. 7. 2, 9.
Let EVERYMAN (therefore every Pope, Bishop, Priest, Deacon, as well as Layman)
have his own Wife, and every Woman her own Husband, rendering this unanswerable
reason for it, for it is better to marry then to burn; better for every man,
for any man; Therefore for Popes, Bishops, Priests, Monks, who burn as much, if
not more than any others.

10ly. That Ephesians. 5. 22, to 33.
marriage, (especially of Christ's Ministers under the Gospel) most lively
represents, typifies to Christians, the conjugal union, love, affection that is
between our Lord Jesus Christ, his Church, and every true Believer; the Church
in Scripture being styled Cant: 1. 8, to 13. c. 5. 1.
Christ's Spouse, the Rev: 21. 9.
Lamb's wife, to whom he is said to Mat. 22. 2, 4. c 25. 10. Jer. 3. 14. Rev:
19. 7, 9. Jer. 31. 32. c. 54. 5.
be married, yea to be her Husband, and to whose marriage all Christians are
invited. Therefore it can no ways unfit, or disable Popes, Bishops, Priests,
Ministers (who pretend they have nearest approaches to, and union, communion
with Jesus Christ, engrossing to themselves the Title of his Church, Spouse) to
enjoy or execute their holy Functions in his Church, as Popes decree and
dictate.

11ly. That God himself by St. Paul (the only pretended Patron, Pattern of
Priests single, unmarried lives) has in precise terms, in two several Epistles
to 1 Timothy 3. 2, 4, 10, 11, 12.
Timothy and Titus 1. 6. c. 2. 4, 5.
Titus, (Diocesan Bishops of Ephesus and Creet, as most See my Unbishoping of
Timothy and Titus.
Pontificians and Prelates assert) prescribed Marriage as a necessary
qualification, amongst others, for all Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, allowing
them, (without the least inhibition or restraint) to be the Husband of one
Wife, yea to have Wives and Children lawfully begotten on them, in these
positive words: A Bishop then must be blameless, the Husband of one Wife,
vigilant, etc. one that rules well his own House, having his Children in
subjection, with all gravity. Likewise must the Deacons be grave, etc. Let the
Deacons be the Husbands of one Wife, ruling their Children and their own Houses
well: Even so must their Wives (to wit, of Presbyters, Bishops, Deacons,) be
grave, no Slanderers, sober, faithful in all things, chaste, Keepers at home,
etc. Which qualifications were purposely inserted into these Texts by Gods
special providence, to justify the lawfulness of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons
marriages, wives, and conjugal estate, against all Papal subsequent Decrees,
Canons prohibiting them; Which qualifications both Gratian Distinct. 26, to 33.

Gratian, and other Popish Canonists, Writers concerning the Ordination,
qualification of Bishops, Priests, Deacons, recite, retain: yet impudently
endeavor to elude by these two irrational shifts, diametrically repugnant to
the words and sense of these unanswerable Texts.

The 1. evasion is, Evasion 1.
That the Husband of one Wife, is intended only of the time past, of Bishops,
Priests, Deacons, before they are admitted in to these Orders, not present or
future time; of such who are to be actually ordained Bishops, Priests, Deacons,
at the time of their Ordination, or after admittance to these Orders. To wit,
See Gratian Distinct. 26, 27 etc. the Statute of Bygamy, 4 E. 1. c. 5. Cook. 2.
Instit p. 273. Papae Greg. 9 Decr. l. 6. Decr. 2. 1^
that no Person who has had two Wives, either together or successively, or
married a Widow, though both Wives be actually dead or divorced from him, ought
to be ordained a Bishop, Priest or Deacon, or admitted to claim or enjoy the
benefit of Clergy in criminal cases: but only single Persons, or such who have
formerly had but one Wife, from which they must be separated either by death or
divorce, before they must be ordained; their actual marriage and cleaving to
one Wife, disabling them by their Papal Constitutiors either to receive Orders,
or to retein or exercise these their Functions after their Ordinations.

I answer, Answer.
1. That this Papal restriction of Paul's qualifications only to such as are to
be ordained Bishops, Priests, Deacons, before their Ordination, without
relating to those who are such, is 1. Directly contrary to the letter of the
Text; which describes the qualifications of such who are Leo 1. Epist. 87
Ambrose, Primasius, Chrysostom. Sedul, Theod. Theoph. Oecum. on 1 Timothy 3. and
Tit. 1.
actual Bishops, Priests, Deacons, as well at and after the time of their
ordinations, as before, as the words in the present and future (not
preterperfect) tence, A Bishop then must be blameless, the Husband of one Wife,
etc. positively resolve. Now no Person by the Gratian Distinct. 91, 92. Summa
Rosella, Angelica, Hostiensis, and others, Tit. Clericus, Ordo Sacerdos,
Episcopus, Praedicatio, Sacramentum.
Popes, Canonists, Schoolmens resolutions, is or can be a Bishop, Priest,
Deacon, or exercise these Functions in the Church before he be actually
ordained: Therefore this qualification applied to them as and whiles they are
Bishops, Priests, Deacons, must be intended after their admission to these
Orders, rather than before. 2ly. This restriction of it only to the time past,
preceding their Ordinations; turns, A Bishop then must be the Husband of one
wife; Let the Deacons be the Husband of one wife, into, Let him not be the
Husband of one, or any wife at all, whiles either a Bishop, Priest or Deacon. A
diametrical contradiction to the Texts. 3ly. The subsequent clauses relating to
their wives, children, Even so must their Wives be grave, etc. having faithful
children in subjection, ruling their children and their own houses well, refer
not only to the time preceding their Ordinations, but subsequent thereunto,
since they cannot be actually divorced from their Children, Households, at or
after their Ordinations, against the Tim. ^. 8
laws of God, Nature, though they may be from their Wives: Therefore the
Husband of one Wife, must have the same construction in point of Time. 4ly. All
the other qualifications there actually coupled with and surrounding this (the
Husband of one Wife) are principally intended of those who are actually
Bishops, Priests, Deacons, both when and after they are ordained such, rather
than before, viz. A Bishop then must be blameless, vigilant, sober, modest, of
good behavior, given to hospitality; not given to wine, no striker, not greedy
of filthy of lucre; but patient, not a brauler, not covetous. One that rules
his own house with all gravity (for if a man know not how to rule his own
house, how shall he take care of the Church of God?) Not a Novice, etc.
Moreover, he must have a good report of those that are without, etc. Likewise
must the Deacons be grave, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not
greedy of filthy lucre, holding the mystery of Faith in a pure conscience, etc.
If all these qualifications be intended of such who are actual Bishops,
Priests, Deacons, as well when and after they receive orders, as before their
ordination, then the husband of one wife, etc. See Council. Crangr. c. 4. (...)*
Constantinop. Gratian Did: 31, 37. Jerome. in Jovinianum, l. 1.
must have the self-same construction being conjoined with them. 5ly. It would
be a monstrous, ridiculous, untheological interpretation to restrain all these
qualifications to Bishops, Priests, Deacons, only in the time before their
Ordinations, not after them: For example, every Person to be made a Bishop,
Priest, Deacon must, and ought to be blameless, vigilant, sober, of good
behavior, apt to teach, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy
lucre; etc. before he be ordained, but when and after he is made a Bishop,
Priest, Deacon, then he must be no longer thus qualified; but as he was and
must be the husband of one wife, only before his Ordination, not after, so for
congruity-sake (if this be the true meaning of this Text) by the same Papal
interpretation, he may and must be ((...) to many degenerating Popes, Bishops,
Priests, Deacons) blameworthy, (...), unsober, of ill behavior, un-hospital,
unapt to teach, or an un-preaching (...), given to wine, awa^rier, striker,
greedy of filthy lucre, impatient, a brawler, (...), not ruling his own House,
Children well, lifted up with pride, not having a good report, not holding the
mystery of Faith in a pure Conscience. And is not this ^n interpretation well
beseeming a Popes unerring Chair, very suitable to St. Paul's and Gods own
meaning? This interpretation suits well with out (...)
Gildas, and St. (...)
Bernards observations, complaints of the Bishops in their ages: Fratres, sic
facit (...) hodie, multos^ (...) Diabolos Episcopos. Ubi enim, proh Dolor,
Reperiemus Episcopos, qui post adeptam dignitatem in humilitate se contincant,
etc. Male vivunt, et subjectos male vivere volunt. Porro, (...) hujus temporis

Vendunt homicidia, adulteria, incestus, fornicationes, sacrilegia, perjuria,
and (...) ad summum implent manticas suas, etc. Animarum nec casus reputatur

Petrus Blesensis Archdeacon of Bath his observation: ^^requens est inter
Episcopos aliquem invenire, qui primum suae promotionis annum dedicat
sanct^ati, cumque in sua novitate factus est agnus, inveteratus aliquot dierum
fit rapacissimus lupus, etc. What chaste Bishops, Priests, Deacons, Votaries,
they prove after their enring into religious Orders, abjuration of Marriage and
lawful wives, you have heard before: Perchance to make these Qualifications
only antecedent, not concurrent with, not subsequent to their Ordinations, nor
concomitant or dependent on them, as they do the husband of one wife.

The 2d. Evasion is this, That the Husband of one Wife is to be interpreted
only Metaphoricallie, (...)
not properly, That is, a Bishop, Priest, Deacon, ought to have only one Wife;
that is, one Bishopric, one Benefice, (...)
Church, or Ecclesiastical Living with Cure of Souls, and no more, not of a
proper wedded Wife, This is a strained, pitiful eluding of these Texts,
pointblanck against the words, meaning, yea fatal to the former Popish evasion.

For 1. The husband of one wife, A^^wer.
is never taken in this sense in the Old or New Testament, for the Bishop,
Priest, Parson, Rector of one Bishopric, Parochial Church, Synogogue, or
Congregation, but in a litteral genuine sense: Therefore it must be so intended
here. 2ly. All the other recited qualifications of Bishops, Priests, Deacons,
here conjoined with^it, are taken, interpreted only in their proper, not in any
allegorical, analogical, tropological or metaphorical sense: Therefore this
ought to be so too. 3ly. The qualifications here required in their Wives, in
direct terms: Likewise must their Wives (...)
be grave, not Slanderers, sober, faithful in all things, chaste, keepers at
home, etc. are all improper, unapplicable to a Bishopric, Benefice, or
Parochial Church in any sense; being peculiar only to real Wives and Women;
Therefore it can only be meant, interpreted of such. 4ly. These Clauses, A
Bishop, Priest, Deacon, must be one that rules well his own House, having
faithful children in subjection, ruling their own children and their houses
well, are put in direct opposition to public Churches, Benefices; the children
here only intended, are children begotten of their proper Wives bodies, (as
the children of Highpriests, Priests, Levites were under the Law) not children
spiritually engendered by the ministry of the Word: as will be yet more evident
by comparing these Texts with 1 Timothy 2. 15. Notwithstanding she shall be saved
by Childbearing, and chapter 5. 10, 14. If she have brought up children: I will
therefore that the young women marry, bear children, guide the house, (all used
in a proper litteral sense, in the same Epistle;) Therefore children must be
thus interpreted in these Texts too, not in a strained Metaphorical sense or
construction. 5ly. If by this one Wife, be only meant one Bishopric or
Benefice, then why do Popes or Popish Prelates dispense with their having
Pluralities, against sundry Council. Agathense, Can. 57. Calc^donense, Can. 10.

Notable Petitions even in Popish Parliaments: yea, why do they authorize

Bishoprics, Benefices, Abbeys, Priories, and Ecclesiastical Dignines, by way
of Commendams, notwithstanding these express prohibitions to Timothy and
Titus? yet will not dispense with them to hold one lawful wife, upon any
terms, which God himself expressly allows them; though they dispense with them
for money to keep as many Concubines as they have Livings, enforcing Priests to
pay annual Pensions to their uses for every Living they enjoy, which they must
duly pay, though they keep no Concubine at all, because they have license to do
it, if they please; as the German Princes in their Diet at Flacius Illyricus

incapable of any Bishopric, Benefice, or Ecclesiastical preferment, before he
be in Orders. And if the husband of one wife, that is, of one Bishopric, or
Benefice, be a previous qualification to his ordination; a Layman shall then
be capable of a Bishopric or Benefice before he is in Orders: so as this Text
remains unanswerable, to justify the Lawfulness of Bishops, Priests, Deacons
Marriages, notwithstanding Pope Hildebrauds or others Decrees, as Claudius
Espencaeus (a learned Popish Bishop) acknowledges, in his Commentaries on 1 Timothy 3. 2. and Tit. 1. 5, 6.

12ly. God himself, by a prophetical Spirit, not only predicted, but in precise
terms pre-condemned in this very Epistle of Paul (where he permits, prescribes
Bishops, Priests, Deacons, to be the Husband of one wife) the forbidding of
Priests wives marriage, as unlawful, as the very doctrine of 1 Timothy 4. ^* 2, 2.
Devils, and seducing spirits, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their
consciences scared with an hot iron; commanding Timothy to put the brethren in

suadente Diabolo, he had raised up Gods wrath and hatred amongst Christians,
(by his prohibiting of Priests Marriages, as well as receiving investitures
from Laymens hands,) is a sufficient motive eternally to explode it.

The Glosses on Gratian resolve, Matrimonium est res sacratissima; yea the
Church, Popes, Bishops, Priests of Rome have enrolled Marriage in the very list
of of their 7. Sacraments, as a Sacrament and most sacred Ordinance of divine
institution; by this device, they have made Popes, Bishops, Priests in their
Ecclesiastical Consistories, the sole and only competent Judges of aell causes,
questions concerning matrimony; which no Kings, nor other Laymen may any ways
examine or determine. Moreover they have canonized Orders for another of their
Sacraments, and joined it and Marriage to each other in the Catalogue of their
Sacraments: It seems therefore very strange, irrational, contradictory, that
this their Sacrament of Marriage should so defile their Popes, Bishops,

3ly. I shall cloze up the History of Hildebrands Papacy, with these memorable
Censures of his Antichristian proceedings against the Emperor Henry the 4th,
written by learned Bishops of that age in justification and defense of the
Emperors Sovereignty, against his New Usurpations. Valtramus Naumbergensis
Episcopus shall lead the Van, who in his Notable Treatise Mat. Flacius
Illyricus Catalogus Testium Veritatis, Argentorati, 1562 p. 212, etc. Mat.
Freherus, Germaniae Scriptores Francofurti, 1600. p. 228, etc.
De Unitate Ecclesiae, (written about the year 1077.) asserts from Scripture
and other Evidences, Papam non habere politicum gladium, multo minus aliquod
Dominium super Imperatorem; Nullo jure posse eum subditos Imperatoris, aut
aliorum Dominorum, a juramento fidelitatis absolvere. Quod omnis anima sit
subjecta superioribus potestatibus: atque ideo etiam Spirituales summos and
infimos, politicis Magistratibus obedire debere. Papas and Episcopos non tantum
nullas justas causas habere, quod Caesarem (Henricum 4.) persequantur, sed
etiam in ipsa persecutione adeo modum excellere, ut plane scelerate et impie
contra omnia divina et humana jura fecerant. His arguments against the Popes
Supremacy from Scripture, are principally these: Nolite plures Magistri fieri,
fratres mei, scientes, quoniam magis judicium sumitis; Sicut dixit Jac. 3. 1.
Jacobus Apostolus. Ex doctrina Domini ac Salvatoris nostri; Mat. 23. 8.
Vos, inquit, nolite vocari Rabbi: unus est enim Magister vester: Mat. 23. 11.
Luke 22. 26.
Qui enim, inquit Christus, major est vestrum, erit minister vester; Luke 14.
11. c. 18. 54.
Qui enim se exaltaverit, humiliabitur; and qui se humiliaverit exaltabitur;
Sed cum ipse unus Magister Christus, idemque Deus, Dan. 2. 21.
muter tempora, and transferat regna, Prove. 21. 1
tenens corda Regum in dextra sua; Legimus docuisse Hildebrandum Papam, quod
potestatem ipse habuerit super Reges, et super regna? et posse id facere, quod
per Deum tantum fieri dicit Psalmista; Psalm. 75. 7.
Hunc humiliet, and hunc exaltet: Nam Mat. 22. 21.
reddite, inquit, quae sunt Caesaris, Caesari; and quae sunt Dei, Deo. Quam
certe regulam proprio consirmavit exemplo, dicens Petro Apostolo, Mat. 17. 24,
25, 26, 27.
Ut non scandalizemus eos, id est, ne nos Caesari contradicentes, tumultuandi
eis occasionem praebeamus, vade ad mare, and mitte hamum, and eum piscem qui
primus ascenderit, toll, and aperto ore ejus invenies staterem; illam sumens
da eam pro me and te. Mat. 11. 29.
Et discite a me quia mitis sum, and humilis cord. Qui utique do^u^t
Apostolos, Ecclesiam, non Regnum disponere, vel ordinare, quod nec ip^e legitur
affectasse, Joan. 6. 15.
Qui fugit in montem solus orare, cum turbae venissent rapere eum and Regem
constituere. Phil. 2. 6, 7. 8
Quoniam cum in forma Dei esset, formam servi accipiens, Mat. 20. 28.
Venit ministrare, non ministrari; juxta quod etiam Paulus: Apostolus, 1 Cor.
9. 18.
Cum liber esset ex omnibus, omnium se servum fecit, ut plures lucr^aceret.
Unde and Gregorius Papa, cum esset Summus Pontifex, and virtutum artifex, in
tantum se infra omnium humiliavit, ut prius ipse in Epistolis suis, Servus
servorum Dei, se appellaverit, and hoc humilitatis nomen ad posteros quoque
transmiserit, etc. (After which he subjoyns) Ecce quomodo ille Minister Diaboli
(Hildebrandus) Ecce quomodo insanit, quomodo nos secum in foveam perditionis
mittere quaerit? Sic divisit Sacerdotia, quemadmodum Ecclesiam Dei, atque
Rempublicam Imperii, quoniam parts inde segregavit sibi. Inter ipsum namque
and inter Regem Henricum graves exortae sunt atque execrabiles dissidiae; Papa
plurimum anitente, ut Rex deponeretur a Regia potestate pariter et dignitate;
Rege vero contra nitente, ut defenderet se ab hostium suorum circumventione,
qui pro part ejusdem Papae certant, quaerebant eum opprimere; Exinde omnia
scandalorum exorta sunt genera: See here, p. 272.
Exinde crevit grave and diuturnum bellum, and non solum civil, sed plus quam
civil bellum, and factae sunt absque divino pariter atque humano respectu,
vastationes Ecclesiarum, and caedes hominum. Exinde etiam corruptae sunt
divinae pariter et humanae Leges, sine quibus non subsistit vel Dei Ecclesia,
vel Imperii Respublica: Exinde violata est fides, et publica et catholica:
Exinde etiam crevit illa injustitia, ut pro veritate falsa testimonia, et pro
fide catholica abundent perjuria, ut postquam leges bello siluere coactae,
impleatur jam ista Domini sententia per Ose 4. 1, 2.
Oseam Prophetam; Non est, inquit, veritas, and non est misericordia, et non
est scientia Dei in terra; maledictum and mendacium, and homicidium and furtum
inundaverunt, and sanguis sanguinem tetigit; Haec nunc abundant et
superabundant propter Doctrinam Hildebrandi Papae, qua divisit corpus vel
Ecclesiae, vel Reipublicae. Nunquid hoc est Apostolicum esse? Et in doctrina et
conversatione Catholicum esse? et Gregorium, id est, vigilantem esse? et in
doctrina et conversatione Catholicum esse, secundum sententiam superius
propositae Epistolae? Atque cum tali Hildebrando parts habere, et ejusmodi
qualia supradicta sunt, flagitia nutrire, fovere, vel defendere, nunquid hoc
est, Phil 2. 14:

Patribus, non fratribus, Dominis, non amicis, N. designatus Treverensis
Episcopus, Ecclesiae devotissimas orationes in Christo. Far sententiam contra
Apostolicum, non est tutum, imo insanum, et omnino nefarium, aliquid audere in
illum, qui in vice S. Petri fungitur legatione ipsius Christi. Iste autem qui
invasit sedem Apostolicam, qui inaudita elatione effertur, qui prophanis
novitatibus studet, amplo nomine delectatur, quem neque Christianum appellem,
quia non habet characterem, id est, pacem et charitatem, quam Christus suis
militibus impressit, qua Christus suos notavit; non occurrere contra hunc, non
insurgere, magnum sanctae matris Ecclesiae est periculum, et plane est contra
Deum. Quis enim nescit, ex hoc quasi font omnis dissensionis, et capitis omnis
schismatis, exclusa pace Ecclesiae, discordiam totius mundi emersisse? Quis
inquam, non videt, per hunc quasi signiferum, tantum sanguinem mundi effusum
esse? De multis rationibus, qui non sequitur Christum, nequeo vere appellare
Christianum; ita certe nec Papam, quem video toties et tam manifestum
homicidam. En bonus et sanctus Papa, cujus consiliis, cujus instinctu et ductu,
membra Christi tot et tam perditis modis sunt dilacerata. En bonus pastor, qui
in illos tanta crudelitate grassatur, pro quibus Christus in cruce pependit,
quas ipso proprio sanguine redemit. En verus Pontifer et justus Sacerdos, qui
sicut dubitat, si illud quod sumitur in Dominica mensa, sit verum corpus et
sanguis Christi, item non poenitentibus etiam ea quae just fracta sunt
condonat sacramenta. Nihil certe ita impium est, et nefarium, nihil ita est
detestabile et erecrabile, quod ipse curet, dum alios contra Regem armet: dum
alios ad bellum quod ipse omnibus intendit, excitet. Inter has multiplices
calamitates and miserias, quas patiatur et conqueritur sancta Ecclesia, mihi
quoque illata est ab eo, tam superba quam violenta injuria, etc. Ut taceam mea,
ut praetermittam privata; Quia malus, and non purus ejus introitus, quae
minatus est, pervenit ad perditissima exempla, ne plus per hunc sancta, quae
modo ertremum trahit spiritum, periclitetur Ecclesia; ex me dico, quod nullam
ei obedientiam posthac servabo, nec meo judicio amplius sedebit in loco et vice
Sancti Petri, quem ipse non sequitur, obstupenda abusione novitatis suae, et
inauditi Decreti, against the Emperor.

Chronicon, l. 17.
Gotfridus Viterbiensis writing of Hildebrands excommunication and deposition
of Hen. the 4th. observes, (as Chron. l. c. 35.
Otto Frisingensis living in that age had done before him) Ante hunc
Imperatorem, non legimus aliquem a Romano Pontifice excommunicatum, aut Imperio
privatum, nisi forte illud pro excommunicatione reputetur, quod Philippus
primus Christianus Imperator ad breve tempus a Romano Pontifice, inter
poenitentes legitur collocatus; aut illud quod Theodosius, ob cruentam hominum
caedem a liminibus Ecclesiae legitur sequestratus (to wit by St. Ambrose his
admonition, to which he submitted, not by any Papal excommunication, as some
Pontificians mistake.)

The History of Philip, the 1. Christian Emperor, being much insisted on by
Pope Hildebrand and other Romanists, to justify the Popes usurpations in
excommunicating and deposing Kings and Emperors; is thus related by Eusebius,
only as a bare report or fame, not an undoubted truth, without any mention of,
or relation to the Pope. Ecclesiast. Hist. lib. 6. c. 27. Centur. Magd. 11.
col. 8. 144, 151. Ruffinus c. 25.
Fama est istum (Christianus namque erat) cum precationum in die postremae
vigiliae Paschalis, una cum multitudine in Ecclesia Particeps fieri vellet, non
prius ab Episcopo, qui tum Ecclesiae praerat (without naming the Church where,
or Bishops name by whom this was reported to be done) permissum est intrare,
quam se confessus fuisset, and inter eos qui peccatorum vinculis adhuc
tenebantur astricti, locumque poenitentiam agentibus praestitutum occupabant,
se sua sponte (not by force of any formal Anathema, Excommunication or
Interdict denounced against him) collocavisset. Episcopumque dixisse, eum non
alia condition, nisi istud faceret, propter multa delicta quae ab eo
ferebantur admissa, (whereof the Sea Grimstons Imperial History in the Life of
Philip.
ungrateful treacherous murder of his Lord and Master Gordianus the Emperor,
to invade his Throne was not the least) aliquando ab ipso in Ecclesiam receptum
fore. Imperatorem autem alacri animo and lubenti, Episcopo morem gessisse, and
ingenuam modestiam ac religiosam piamque affectionem, Dei timore incitatam,
reipsa declarasse memorant. Moreover, Ecclesiast. Histor. l. 5. c. 25
Niceph. Calistus relates the story only as a report (aiunt, or ferunt) without
informing us in what Church it was, or by what Bishop; but only indefinitely;
non prius tamen in conventum fidelium accedere, intercessione and impedimento
ejus qui tum Ecclesiae praesuit Episcopi, permissum esse, quam confiteretur, et
poenitentium numero, qui ordine and loco suo segregati, disciplina certa
explorabantur, aggregaretur; quod non aliter licere, ille diceret, nisi hoc
fecisset, propter multas ejus noxas, cum Ecclesiae multitudine conventus ejus
festi participem fieri. Eum vero rebus ipsis timorem divim nominis,
religionemque debitam rite atque sincere declarantem, obsequentem ille esse
ferunt. In the margin I find these notes annexed: Episcopalis libertatis
exemplum, exemplum Principis ecclesiasticae disciplinae sese submittentis.
Without one word of the Pope in the whole story. Now because Fabianus was
reputed Bishop of Rome at that time, Rerum Romanorum, l. 10 p. 126. Julius
Philippus.
Eutropius (a great advancer of the Popes authority) makes bold to assert, that
he was the Bishop. Isti primi omnium Imperatorum Christiani Romae facti sunt,
(though converted to the faith by Origens Letters, (not the Popes) as most
record) and in die Paschae, id est, in ipsis vigiliis, cum interesse voluisset,
and communicare mysteriis, See Grimston in the Life of Philip.
a Fabiano Episcopo Romano (though neither Eusebius, Nicephorus, nor others
before him, aver it) non prius est permissum, nisi confiteretur peccata sua,
and inter poenitentes staret; nec ullo modo copiam sibi mysteriorum futuram,
nisi prius per poenitentiam culpas, quae de eo ferebantur plurimae, diluisset.
Then he concludes only with a, Fertur igitur libenter, quod a Sacerdote sibi
imperatum fuerat, suscepisse, divinum sibi inesse metum, and fidem religionis
plenissimam rebus atque operibus comprobans. Which uncertain Report, how little
it makes for Hildebrands excommunication or deposition of Henry the 4th,
absolving his subjects from their allegiance, setting up Rudolphus in his royal
throne, making him dance attendance barefooted three days together in frost
and snow at his palace gate, without admitting him entrance to his presence,
upon his humiliation and repentance; when as the Emperor Philip was presently
admitted upon his confession and repentance to the Church and Sacraments the
very next morning, and neither excommunicated nor deposed for murdering his
predecessor and usurping his throne; (as Henry was only for defending his right
of Investitures against this usurping Pope) let all indifferent Readers resolve.

If any desire further satisfaction concerning the oppositions then made
against Hildebrands Antimonarchical seditious, pernicious, heretical doctrines,
and Apologetical ple^s for the Emperors right, let them peruse Melchior
Goldastus his Collectio Scriptorum Apologeticorum pro Henrico Quarto; adversus

Having represented you with this large account of Pope Hildebrands
Antimonarchical, heretical, diabolical positions and practices during his life,
give me leave to mind you of one memorable fabulous prediction (which Anno
1073. sect. 16
Cardinal Baronius very seriously insists on, though In vita Greg. 7. fol. 234.
Gobelinus in Cosmedron, aetas 6. c. 54.
Onuphrius with others, style it, inconcinna fabilla, invented by nescio quis
fabulator) portending them, yea his antichristian usurpation of the very Title,
Sovereignty, Throne of Christ himself. Cum filius esset fabri lignarii, ex
^armentis ordine compositis, inscium ipsum has literas ordin c^^seruiss, quibus
adstans, homo literatus legerit, ex ea compositione scandularum, Dominabitur a

habet: (...) hoc facit quod Zacharias ait de Christo, c. 9. 10. Potestas ejus a
mari usque ad mare; and Psalm. 71. 8. Et, dominabitur a mari usque ad mare;]
Strange Antichristian shameless blasphemy.

It is now more then high time to take my farewell of Pope Hildebrands Papacy,
whose Antichristian Heresies, Treasons, Schisms, Usurpations, Corruptions,
transmigrated after his death into sundry of his immediate Successors, trained
up under him, as his devoted creatures. It is Chronicon Slavo^um, l. 1. c. 30.
Joan. Marii de Schis. and Council. c. 7, 8, 9:
Hermoldus his observation, that after Henry the 4. had deposed this Pope
Hildebrand the second time, and installed Clement in his Chair: ex illa die
orta schismata in Ecclesia, qualia non fuerunt in ^^ebus antiquis: and ii
quidem qui videbantur perfectiores and colum^ae in Ecclesia Dei (in his repute,
being an Hildebrandian) adhaeserunt Gregorio; caeteri, quos (...) Caesareus

adversus Imperatorem, and Clementem ejus Papam, indignum ratus, ab ejusdem sui

against the Emperor, illud animi venenum, quod odio plus quam Neroniano, in
illum conceperat, veneno per suum Ministrum Subdiaconum, dum missaret in
calicem injecto (as Herman. Contractus, Carsulanus, Petrus Praemonstratensit,
Knyghton and alii plures relate) or, as Vicelius, Volaterranus, and other
Hildebrandians, qui ab Henrico Caesare, vel a Clemente Pontifice id procuratum
esse malitiose contingunt:) which proves, the consecrated wine, not to be
really transubstantiated into Christ's own natural glorified blood or body,
incapable of any poison, or at least able to allay its mortiferous quality.
Platina, Martinus Polonus, Vincentius, and others write, Eum dysenteria
periisse, quod neque a suspitione data veneni alienum est: Nam and in
dysenteriam, veneno petiti, interdum incidunt, corruptis ac labefactatis

oves Christi dispergere, mactare, laniaregue non desinit: Charging him as the
author of all the persecutions raised against Hildebrand. In this Synod in
pursuit of Hildebrands Decree against Simoniacks, he published these new
Constitutions against Investititures, if Chronicon Cassinense may be credited.

Constituimus, ut si quis deinceps Episcopatum vel Abbatiam de manu alicujus
Laicae personae susceperit, nullatenus Episcopus, vel Abbas habeatur; neque
ulla et, ut Episcopo vel Abbati adhibeatur reverentia. Insuper, ei beati Petri
gremium and introitum Ecclesiae interdicimus, quosque locum, quem sub tanto
crimine ambitionis, and inobedientiae (quod est scelus idololatriae) caepit,
resipiendo non deserit. Similiter etiam de inferioribus Ecclesiasticis gradibus
dignicatibusque constituimus. Si quis item Imperatorum, Regum, Ducum,
Principum, Comitum, vel cujusvis potestatis secularis, Episcopatum, vel quamvis
aliam Ecclesiasticam dignitatem dare praesumpserit, (though they constantly did
it before as their Founders or Patrons, by a Legal and (natural Right) ejusdem
Sententiae vinculo se astrictum noverit; cum Trecenti and octo Patres in Niceno
Concilio, omnes hujusmodi vendentes, and ementes, excommunicaverint; censentes,
ut qui dat, and qui recipit, anathema sit; Cum hujusmodi igitur Episcopis,
Abbatibus, aut Clericis reliquis qui communicate, aut orat, aut ipsorum audit
Missas, una excommunicationis sententia plectitur, qui ne Sacerdotes quidem
rite putari possunt. Poenitentia vero and communio a nemine nisi a Catholico
suscipiatur. Quod si nullus adsit Catholicus Presbyter, rectius est sine
visibili communione persistere (excellent Antichristian Divinity!) and
invisibiliter Domino communicare, quam eam ab haeretico sumendo, a Deo
seperari. Nulla enim (ut ait 2 Cor. 6. 14 15.
Apostolus) conventio Christi ad Belial, neque pars aliqua fideli cum infideli,
omnis autem haereticus infidelis est. Simoniacus vero quia haereticus, idcirco
infidelis; nam sacram Christi communionem quamvis visibiliter and corporaliter
Catholici propter imminentes haereticos habere non possunt: dum tamen mente

Mosen, Prophetas and Psalmos; Jussitque eos in nomine suo poenitentiam, and
remissionem peccatorum praedicare, apud omnes gentes, testesque horum esse. Has
ergo ob causas Hildebrandus ambitione in praeceps abivit, cum potestatem
immortalis Dei, cujus nuncius duntaxat est, sibi usurpavit: Ita mores, ita
tempora, ita homines sunt. Male consuluisset rebus humanis suprema illa
Majestas, si ita gladium in manum mortalis cujusquam traderet. Quis
concupiscentiae humani finem staruerit? aut quis moderaretur? Ne sapientissimus
quidem aequo animo tantum onus tulerit. Non necesse habemus, ut quispiam nos
doceat, quonam pacto spirituali potestate, vel ut verjusdicam, dispensatione
atque procuratione divini peni (Oraculorum enim coelestium promi atque condi
duntaxat sumus) Petrus ejusque Collegae usi fuerint. Clarius luce in Lib: quem

Justitia, Spes salutis, Veritas, Sermo Dei, Fides. Quae munera divina saepius
Imperator noster Christianissimus ultro Hildebrando obtulit, sed ipse accipere
recusavit. Then relating the Emperors manifold virtues, he adds, Rei militaris,
juris, civilium morum, divinarum, humanarumque recum peritia, fortitudo
propemodum nimia, non modo inter reges excellens, Nota.
sed inter illos quoque, quorum hac sola virtus fuit: Jam perpetuum pacis,
pretatis, atque religionis studium, in pauperes liberalitas, majora tribuentis
quam a Deo petuntur. Clementia in devictos, benignitas in amicos, erga milites
benevolentia, in nullo unquam Germano Romanove tanta fuere Principe. Quod si
flagitiosissimus is foret tyrannus, tamen ei obtemperandum, nequaquam
resistendum esset. Prohibent humanae leges, decretaque Patrum adversarios,
hosts, inimicos, accusatores, testes, atque judices esse. Augustus cum in
Italia cum Hildebrando pacem facit, paucorum scelere atque perfidia Saxonia
excidit; perfidus tyrannus qui perfidiae graves poenas reddidit, spreta
religione jurejurandi, violata affinitate, necessitudine eam invasit. Nemini

Sigebertus Gemblacensis, Magnum Chronicon Belgicum, and others, render us this
account of his Papal advancement and proceedings: Machtyldae auxiliis Urbanus
Apostolicum obtinuit thronum, frequentibus Conciliis excommunicans cum
Imperatore Guibertum; Hinc in Ecclesia scandala, and in regno augescunt
dissidia, dum alter ab altero dissidet: Dum regnum and sacerdotium dissentit;
dum alter alterum excommunicat, dum alter alterius excommunicationem, aut ex
causae, aut ex personae praejujudicio despicit, et dum alter in alterum
excommunicandi authoritate magis ex suo libitu, quam ex justitiae respectu
abutitur. Et Authoritas illius, qui dedit potestatem ligandi et solvendi omnino
dispicitur. Nimirum, ut cum pace omnium bonorum dixerim, haec sola novitas (ne
dicam haereses) nedum in mundo emerserat, ut sacerdotes illius, qui dicit Regi
Apostata, and qui regnare facit Hypocritam, propter peccata populi, docerent
populum, malis Regibus nullam subjectionem, et licet eis Sacramentum
fidelitatis fecerit, nullam tamen deberi fidelitatem: nec perjuros nominari qui
contra Regem senserint; imo qui Regi paruerit, pro excommunicato habendum; et
qui contra Regem fecerit, a noxa injustitiae et perjurio absolvendum. These
were the new antichristian, antimonarchical Paradoxes by which this new Pope
and Hildebrandian faction supported their party, and deluded their proselites.

Superiores quos nominavi, quatuordecim Episcopos, albo Pontificum eradunt,

vitentur Christianis: quandoquidem a nobis secessionem fecerunt, non nos ab

Christianam polluunt, concordiam contaminant, Ovibus desertis, ad hosts
Reipublicae profugiunt, ad bella, incendia, homicidia, parricidia, latrocinia,

reverti noluerunt; versutos, obscuros, veteratores, vafros, se esse factis

tuum crederes. Nemo oves persequitur, nullo viso Lupo tamen fugiunt. Quidnam
designassent, si eos fortuna ad tempora Domitiani, Deciique servasset?

designat. Is tertio Idus Julii a Wezilone Moguntino, Segivino Agrippinensi
Pontifice, and aliis plerisque Episcopis consecratur, Imperatorque exercitu
Saxoniam perlustrat. After the Emperor had disbanded his forces, Saxones ab
Episcopis devotis concitati, (such was their restless treacherous Episcopal
genius) absque cunctatione deficiunt, arma resumunt, Augusium cedere finibus
suis compellunt. The Emperor thereupon collecting his forces, notwithstanding
the perjured Bishops and rebellious Saxons former treachery, endeavored out of
his transcendent clemency, to reclaim them by his graciousnesse, instead of
cutting them off as incorrigible Traitors. Rursus induciae fiunt, pacis
conditiones ab utriusque partis amicis dicuntur. Hainricus pacata Saxonia in
Franciam ob Quadragesimae solennem abstinentiam redit. During his absence
there, Episcopi odio excoecati pacem rursus interturbant, copias cogunt, extra
sines Turogorum, Saxonum perducunt, ^omi lacessere armis Imperatorem statuunt,
Wurtzburgium obsident. (O the obstinacy, treachery of Hildebrandian Prelates!)

quum esset favens praecipue Henrico Regi, missis literis ad Ludovicum Comitem
suggerens ei, ut se subderet dicto Regi; tueretur parts ejus; In quibus
literis tanquam pro defensione ordinationis Dei, re autem vera favendo Regi,
laborans, beatae men oriae Gregorio Papae, and piae recordationis Rodolpho
Regi, and Principibus, qui jam in somno pacis requieverant, obloquendo
detrectarant, dicens eos, quasi non fuerint sic periisse, affirmans eis malum
principium fuisse quos finem pessinum contigisset habuisse, quarum literarum
modus iste est.

Valtramus Dei gratia id quod est, Ludovico Serenissimo Principi circumstantia
orationum, semetipsum ad omnia devotissimum. Omni Regno utilis est concordia,
desiderabilis est Justitia: Haec enim virtus, matter est probitatis, and
conservatio totius honestatis: Qui autem intestina grassando dissentione, ad
humani sanguinis alios irritat effusionem, profecto vir sanguinum est, atque
illius particeps, qui nostrum sanguinem sitiens semper circuit, quaerens quem
devoret. Tu igitur gloriosissime Princeps, attendens, quomodo Deus pacis est,
and non dissensionis: quod ex te est, pacem cum omnibus habeas; Deus charitas
est, Diabolus odium. Tota Lex and Prophetae, in dilectione pendent. Qui odit
autem fratrem suum, homicida est, nec habet partem in Christi Regno and Dei.
Hoc ipsa veritas; hoc discipulus ille veritatis protestatur, qui de pectore
Dominico Evangelii profundius potatus veritatem, fluminis impetu laetificat
abundantius Civitatem Dei. Sed ille vas Electionis qui usque ad tertium Coelum,
non secundum hominem sed per revelationem Jesu Christi Evangelium suum didicit,
Omnis inquit, anima potestatibus sublimioribus subdita sit. Non est enim
potestas nisi a Deo. Qui autem resistit potestati, Dei ordinationi resistit.
Sicut amici nostri in mulierculas, and simplex vulgus somniant Regiae potestati
subdi non oportere; falsum est: Ergo quod omnem animam potestati subdi
oporteat. Sed nunquid veritas mendacii arguenda est? An experimentum quaerant
ejus qui in Apostolo loquebatur Christus? An aemulemur Dominum? Nunquam
fortiores illo sumus? fortiorem se confidit, qui Dei Ordinationationi resistit,
quoniam non est potestas nisi a Deo: sed quod ait Propheta: Confundantur omnes
qui pugnant adversum te Domine, and peribunt viri qui resistunt tibi.
Radulphus, Hildebrandus, Eggebertus and innumeri Principes, Dei Ordinationi in
Henrico Imperatore restiterunt; et ecce quasi non fuerint perierunt quia
profecto necesse est malum fuisse principium, quorum finis pessimus subsequutus
est. Nunc ergo, quoniam qui ex adversa sunt suis, adversum nos eminus
digladiantur ratiotinationibus, vestro judicio, ubi jus, vel etia^ in vestro
judicio conferamus, domicilio tantum non suo usurario, sed Christi and antiq.
Patrum utamur testimonio. Ac ne forte recusetur, lex hujus esto certamini, vel
me in populorum transire sententiam, vel ex nostro triumpho vos Dom. nostro
Imperatori lucri faciamus. Attendatur and illud. Si quis aliter evangelizat,
praeter quod evangelizatum est vobis, Anathema sit; hoc Anathema non de
prophanae novitatis usurario, sed de tertio intonuit coelo, De istis autem qui
ignorantes Dei justitiam, and quaerentes suam statuere, justitiae Dei non sunt
subjecti; fiducialiter dixerim, maledicetur illi, and turbenedices; qui
insurgunt in me confundantur, servus autem tuus laetabitur, quoniam (ut ait
Dominus) sine me nihil potestis facere: nec damnas justum quum judicabitur
illi; Tu quis es qui judicas alienum servum? suo Domino stat aut cadit.

in partibus Campaniae morabatur, and ab omnibus Catholicis debita reverentia
colebatur, viz. a Constantinopolitano Imperatore, and a Philippo Francorum
Rege, aliisque diversorum regnorum Principibus tam Ecclesiasticis, quam
Secularibus, excepto Teutonicorum regno, ubi multi ex Catholicis in partem
excommunicatorum, avaritia decepto, sponte sua se transtulerunt. Romani quoque
turrim Crescentii, quae eatenus Domino Papae obediebat, dolo captam, ducere
tentaverant: Guibertum quoque haeresiarcham, quem jamdudum expulerunt, iterum
Roman intrare, and sanctam Ecclesiam, suis non benedictionibus sed
maledictionibus infestare, permiserunt. Whereupon, Dominus Papa Urbanus
generalem Synodum Beneventi collegit, and sententiam anathematics super
Guibertum haeresiarcham and omnes ejus accomplices, Synodali judicio confirmavit.
Soon after VVelpho Boiariae Dux, multos contra Henricum Imperatorem excitavit,
ut ipsum novum Regem eligere decernerent, si quorundam pigritia sive
malevolentia eos non impediret, because the Emperor refused to restore his
Lands and Goods forecited by his Treason, in adhering to Hildebrand and Urban,
nec vellet permittere ut Apostolica seeds a Guiberto haeresiarcha invasa,
Urbano cononice disponeretur; notwithstanding this excommunication, Multi ex
Alemannia Henrico Regi reconciliati sunt, and excommunicationem sedis
Apostolicae communem sibi cum Henrico facere, which they valued not at all;

Anno 1093. Some Monks of Hildebrands faction deserted their Monasteries in
Germany. Bertold. Ibid. p. 368.

Dominus Papa Urbanus Natalem Domini in terra Sancti Petri extra Romam
celebravit. Nam Guibertus haeresiarcha, ita se prope domum Sancti Petri
incastellavit, ut non facile absque humaui sanguinis effusione expelli inde
potuit, and Urbanus nondum Romam absque armata manu intrare potuit,
Guibertistis quidem and excommunicatis multum adhuc ibi praevalentibus, nec
facile se absque violentia expelli permittentibus. Henricus quoque Imperator in
Longobardia jam biennia morabatur, ibique circumquaque terram VVelphonis, Ital.
Ducis, praeda, ferro and incendio vastare non cessabat, ut eundem Ducem and
ejus prudentissimam uxorem (Machtilda^, Pope Hildebrands Mistress) a fidelitate
Sancti Petri discedere, sibique adhaerere compelleret; sed frustra; Nam Dux in
sua sententia perstitit, ipsique satis viriliter restitit. This year (1093.) by
the solicitation of Pope Urban, and Machtilda, Conrade the Emperors Son
deserting his Father, a patre decessit, and VVelphoni Duci, reliquisque
fidelibus Sancti Petri contra patrem cum suis adjuvit. Whereupon by Urbanus
appointment, a Mediolanensi Archiepiscopo and reliquis fidelibus Sancti Petri,
in Regem coronatur, aunente VVelphone Duce Italiae, and Machtilda ejus
charissima conjuge. Civitates quoque de Longobardia, Mediolana, Cremona, Lauda,
Placentia, contra Henricum in viginti annos conjuraverunt, qui omnes praedicto
Duci fideliter adhaeserunt. Transitus etiam Alpium in Longobardiam obtinuerunt,
ut fautores Henrici ad ipsum non possent proficisci. Augustenses Episcopum quem
Henric. illis dedit, expulerunt, ipsique sibi Catholicum pastorem canonice
elegerunt, qui Eporegiensem Episcopum in castello, quo transitus Alpium
custoditur, captivavit. Metensis Ecclesia and Tullensis and Virdunensis, ab
obedientia Egelberti Treverensis excommunicati, eique non amplius obedituras
apertissime mandaverunt. Quorum Metensis, refutatio Episcopo, quem Henricus eis
dare voluit, ipsi sibi canonice pastorem eligere, eumque a Gebehardo
Constantiensi Episcopo sedis Apostolici Legato consecrari fecere. This Popes
Legate the same year held an assembly at Ulin, where VVelpho Duke of Bavaria,
his own Brother Bertoldus; whom he had made Duke of Germany, with sundry
Princes, Bishops, Abbots, Religious persons entered into League and Oath against
the Emperor Henry, Ut ipsi Episcopo Constantiersi omnimodo secundum statuta
Canonum obediretur, and ut Duci Bertolde secundum legem Alemannorum
obsecundaretur, a septimo die Decembris usque in Pascha, and a Pascha in duos
annos. Hanc pacem singuli Principes qui convenerunt, tam majores quam minores
juraverunt, and per potestatem suam usquequaque viritim jurare fecerunt. The
next year they drew into this confederacy Duke Wilpho, France, Alsatia, and
many parts of Germany, even to Hungary. These were the fruits of Hildebrands
Successors and confederates to set up not only Subjects of all sorts against
their lawful Prince, but the Son against the Father; the People against their
lawful Bishops, yea Bishops themselves against their lawful Archbishops
appointed by the Emperor, adhering faithfully to him against Urban their
Antipope; And not satisfied herewith.

conciliaret. Then her scandalous complaints to defame the Emperor must be
published in a great Synod first held at Constans by Geberhardus the Popes
Legate, and spread over all Germany to alienate his Subjects from him then; in
Lombardy, Italy and Rome; God in the mean time during these Rebellions, plagued
and punished these seditious Hildebrandrians not only with intestine wars, but
most grievous pestilences, famine, inundations, prodigious flies, caterpillars,
corrustations, earthquakes, tempests, prodigies from year to year, to bring
them to repentance, recorded at large by Historians. Yet though many of the
vulgar sort of people, and other persons were reclaimed, yea brought to confess
and lament their sins thereby, yet the Pope, Prelates, Clergy and Ringleaders
of this obdurate Hildebrandian factions (all be it many of them were cut off by
sudden death, to their great grief and prejudice of St. Peter's cause) still
proceeded impetinently in their antichristian, antimonarchical Treasons,
rebellions, excommunicating their Opposites afresh in all places; Append. ad
Herm. Chron. An. 1394. p. 370.
and so cauterized the consciences of their own party by their unchristian
Anathemaes, that their great Advocate Bertoldus Constantiensit, informs us:
Magna tamen in illis partibus (viz. Boiaria, Franca, Teutonica, Alsatia) sancta
matter in devitatione excommunicatorum perpessa est, quas utique vix devitare
posset, si non jamdudum Dominus Papa sententiam excommunicationis quodammodo
cum Apostolica authoritate temperasset. Nam multos ipso more praedecessoris sui
venerabilis Papae Gregorii, de excommunicatione seclusit. videlicet, viatores,
rusticos, servos and ancillas, uxores and filios, quos tamen perversa voluntas
eodem vinculo excommunicationis non astrixerit. This salve found out for this
inconvenience, (for which Cardinal Benno and others taxed Hildebrand of
Heresy) An. 1094. in Galliarum Civitate, quam Ostionem vulgaliter dicunt,
congregatum est generale Concilium, a venerando Hugone Lugdunensi Archiepiscopo
and see is Apostol. Legato cum Archiepiscopis, Episcopis and Abbatibus

excommunicatio in Henricum Regem, et in Guibertum sedis Apost. invasorem, et in
omnes eorum accomplices. And not contented herewith: Item Rex Gallicarum
Philippus excommunicatus est (as well as the Emperor, and that in his own Realm
by his own Bishops in obedience to this Pope) eo quod vivente uxore sua aliam
superinduxerit. In Vita Gregorii 7.
Item Simoniac. haeresis, and incontinent. Sacerdotum sub excommunicatione
damnata est. The like was decreed in the Council of Constans, held by the Popes
Legate the same year, who prohibited the people under pain of excommunication
not to resort to the Masses and divine Offices of Simonians or married Priests,
which many thereupon in Alsatia refused to do.

celebrated the Nativity at Pisa, where Dagobertus the Bishop most studiously
serving him, he honored him and his See with a Pall and Title of
Archbishopric. By this Popes treachery, Henricus in Longobardia morabatur
paene omni regia dignitate privatus. Nam filius suus Conradus, jamdudum in
Regem coronatus, se ab illo penitus separavit, et Dominae Mathildae caeterisque
fidelibus sancti Pe^ri, firmiter conjunctus, totum robur parerni exexcitus in
Longobardia obtinuit. Dominus Papa Deo and S. Petro prosperante (whom he
intities to these unnatural, prosperous Treacheries and Rebellions) jam paene
ubique praevaluit, and in media Longabardia, in Civitate Placantina, inter
ipsos Schismaticos and contra ipsos generalem Synodum condixit, ad quam
Episcopos Italiae, Burgundiae, Franciae, Alemanniae, Boiariae, aliarumque
Provinciarum, Canonica et Apostolica authoritate missis Literis convocavit,
(without either the Emperor or the Kings Mandates, the only lawful ancient
Summoners of General, National, and Provincial Councils too, as the premises
evidence) Ad quam Synodum tam innumerabilis multitudo confluxit, ut nequaquam
in qualibet Ecclesia illius loci possit comprehendi. Unde and Dominus Papa
extra urbem in campo illam celebrare compulsus est. In hac Synodo Praxedis
Regina jamdudum ab Henrico separara (by the Popes and Mathildaes persuasion and
advice, to defame her Husband) super maritum suum Domino Apostolico and Sanctae
Synodo conquesta est, de inauditis fornicatorum Spurcitiis quas apud maritum
passa est: cujus querimoniam Dominus Papa cum Sancta Synodo satis
misericorditer suscepit, eo quod ipsam tantas spurcitias non tam commisisse
quam invitam pertulisse pro certo cognoverit: (She and they fathering her
abominable Adulteries on the Emperor) Unde and de poenitentia pro hujusmodo
flagitiis injungenda illam clementer absolvit, quae and peccatum suum
(therefore not the Emperors) sponte and public confiteri non erubuit (to shame
the Emperor rather than herself) Ad hanc Synodum Philippus Rex Galliarum
legatum suum direxit, seque ad illum iterarripisse, sed legitimis sociis se
impeditum fuisse mandavit, unde inducias sibi usque Pentecost. apud Dominum
Papam Synodo intercedente impetravit; Dominus autem Hugo Lugdunensis
Archiepiscopus ad eandem Synodum vocatus, ab Officio suspenditur, eo quod ipse
non venerit nec legatum cum canonica excusatione illuc pro se direxerit, [a
just reward for excommunicating his Sovereign.] Now because so many were
excommunicated* that few of their Party could be admitted to the Lords Supper,
without some mitigation of the laws, they enacted amongst other things in that
Synod, Ut quilibet rite ad confessionem venientibus Eucharistiam non denegemus,
quos solo corpore non mente inter excommunicatos manner, nec tamen eorum
Sacramentis communicare, cognoscimus. They likewise condemned Priests and
Deacons Marriages under the nickname of Nicholaitans, and Investirures under
the Title of Simony, in pursuance of Hildebrands Decrees, which they then
ratified. Item haeresis Nicholaitarum [i.] incontinentiam Subdiaconorum,
Diaconorum, and praecipue Sacerdotum, irretractabiliter damnata est, ut
deinceps de officio se non intromittant, qui in illa haeresi manner non
formidant, nec populus eorum officia nullo modo recipiat, si ipsi Nicholaitae,
contra haec interdicta ministrare praesumant. In hac quoque Synodo haeresis
Simoniacorum penitus damnata est, ut quicquid and in sacris ordinibus, and in
Ecclesiasticis rebus, data and promissa pecunia acquisitum Simoniace videretur,
pro irrito haberetur, nullasque vires habuisse, and habere judicaretur. His
tamen non Simonaice and nescienter a Simoniacis ordinati sunt, misericordia in
servando ordine concessa est; qui vero scienter ab hujusmodi ordinati sunt, cum
suis ordinatoribus irrecuperabiliter damnati sunt, for receiving Investitures
only from Laymen.

Item in Guibertum haeresiarcham sedis Apostolicae invasorem, and in omnes ejus
accomplices [wherein the Emperor was principally intended] sententia anathematis
Synodali judicio cum ardentibus candelis iterum promulgata est. In hac Synodo
quatuor millia fere Clericorum and plusquam triginta millia Laicorum fuisse
perhibentur. After which Conradus Rex filius Henrici, [whom the Pope had
traitorously, unnaturally set up in rebellion and oppostion against his Father]
Domino Papae Urbano, Cremonam venienti obviam progreditur, eique stratoris
officium exhibuit, quarto Idus Aprilis. Deinde fecit ei fidelitatem juramento,
de vita, de membrir, and de Papatu Romano. Dominus autem Papa in filium Sanctae
Romanae Ecclesiae recepit illum, eique Consilium and adjutorium ad obtinendum
regnum, and ad Coronam Imperii acquirendam, coram populo firmissime promisit,
salva quidem justitia illius Ecclesiae, and Statutis Apostolicis, maxim de
investituris in spiritualibus officiis a Laico non usurpandis.

in qua 13. Archiepiscopi cum eorum Suffraganeis fuerunt, and 205. Pastorales
virgae numeratae sunt. In hac Synodo Dominus Papa eadem Statuta quae in
praeterita Synodo Placentina confirmavit, insuper and Philippum Regem Galliarum
excommunicavit, eo quod propria uxore dimissa, militis sui uxorem sibi in
Conjugium sociavit. Philip the next year, Jamdudum pro adulteriis
excommunicatus, tandem Domino Papae, dum adhuc in Gallia moraretur, satis
humiliter ad satisfactionem venit, and abjurata adultera, in gratiam receptus
est, seque in servitium Domino Papae satis promptum exhibuit:

His temporibus maxima multitudo de Italia, and omni Gallia and Germania
Hyerosolymam contra Paganos, ut liberarent Christianos ire coepit, cujus
expeditionis Dom. Papa maximus author fuit. Nam and in praeteritis Synodis
studiosissime omnes de hac expeditione promovere eamque eis in remissionem
omnium peccatorum faciendam firmissime commendavit: omnes quoque qui se ad hoc
iter devoverunt, signo crucis seipsos in vestibus notare fecit, quod etiam
signum quibusdam, in ipsa carne notum apparuit. Unde and a quampluribus Dei
ordinatione and inspiratione ipsum iter incaeptum fuisse credebatur. Nimium
tamen simpliciter innumerabilis multitudo popularium iter illud arripuit, qui
nullo modo se ad tale periculum praeparare noverunt and potuerunt. Unde et
eorum non parva pars occubuit quae terram Ungarorum satis impudenter devastare
praesumpsit, reliqui vero subsequentem multitudinem Rex Vngariae terram illam
intrare, non permisit, cujus etiam non minima pars ad introitum Vngariae
occubuit. Non erat autem mirum quod propositum iter ad Jerusalem implere non
potuerunt, qui non tali humilitate and devotione ac deberet illud iter adorti
sunt. Nam et plu^es Apostatas in comitatu suo habuerunt, qui abjecto religionis
habitu cum illis militare proposuerunt. Sed and innumerabiles foeminas secum
habere non timuerunt, quae naturalem habitum in virilem nefarie mutaverunt, cum
quibus fornicati sunt, in quo Deum mirabiliter, sicut israeliticus populus
quondam, offenderunt. Unde post labores, pericula et mortes, tandem cum
Vngariam non permitterentur intrare, domum macte cum magna tristitia caeperunt
repedare. Such was the ill success of this holy Cheat, designed for other ends.

Joannes Aventinus renders us this account of Conrades Rebellion against his
Father and his proceedings against him, when incorrigible. Augustus jam ad
statum pristinae Majestatis, universis pacatis, Hildebrando sublato, Vrbano
profugo rediisse videbatur and redierat, nisi filius suus Conradus, aemulus
paternae potentiae fax and turbo novae discordiae fuisset. Is suasu Urbani and
Machtyldae filiam Rogeri Normanni Siciliae reguli uxorem ducit; a Patre
decessit, Italiae regnum sibi vendicat, moxque ad eum omnes inimici Augusti
provolant. Augustus frustra crebro ad filium Legatos mittit, sibi insidiari non
desinentem, ex professo sub magna superficie pietatis exercitus, proceres,
milites sollicitantem, nequicquam orat, obsecrat, ne tam infandum scelus
adversus genitorem (qui eum hactenus consortem Imperii successorem testari
perseveraverit) committat; sed surdo cecinit Augustus. Clemens tertius Vrbe a
Conrado pellitur. Vrbanus restituitur; mox invicem diras inferiasque dicunt.
Vrbanus acta Hildebrandi tueri, Clemens rescindere pergit. Imperator quoque
summa open contra Urbanum nititur. Moveri rursus Civitas Christiana, and
dissensio Civilis, quasi permistio terrae erumpere coepit, scinditurque populus
Christianus, pauci reperti, qui veram pietatem, injustae potentiae
anteponerent; partium studia, quae extincta erant, gliscunt. Neque illis
modestia, neque ullus est modus contentionis; utrisque cupiditas victoriae haud
satis moderata; multos mortales ea lues extinxit, remque Christianam
pessundedit; dum alteri alteros quovis modo vincere volunt. Vrbanus criminando
Imperatorem, plebem Christianam exagitat occulte largiendo, indulgendo,
pollicitando, magis incendit, ita ipse clarus, potens factus, ex libidine sua
victoria utitur, plusque sibi ac successoribus spinarum ac potentiae, quam
pietatis, atque amoris comparavit sub titulo Christi, pro sua magnitudine
amplitudineque laboravit. Namque uti paucis verum absolvam, post illa tempora
quicunque concionem divinam agitavere honestis nominibus, quasi jura Ecclesiae,
libertatemque religionis defenderent, et quo Romani Episcopi authoritas maxima
foret, bonum publicum simulantes pro sua quisque potentia certaverunt.
Imperator quidem contra haec summa open connisus fuit: And by all possible means
endeavored to reclaim his Son Conrade from his Unnatural Rebellion, but
could not prevail, being intoxicated by Urban and Machtylda; whereupon, Ibidem,

Dium immortalem, per Majestatem Imperii, per salutem and dignitatem vestram,
per jusjurandi religionem, qua nobis and Reipub. astricti estis obtestor, ut
po^;itis gratia atque odio in commune consulatis, and Rempublicam capessatis;
pietatem, pacem jam pridem factione atque perfidia paucorum terris depulsam,
vestro labor, vestraque industria reducem stabilite; saevior tempestas rursus
fluctibus obruit, me in Imperium natum educatumque; quem Deus summus rerum
arbiter, and vos Imperatorem rebus humanis imposuistis, non inimicus, neque
hostis, sed quod falsum esse, and neminem credere percupiam, filius meus
illecebris foemineis captus, quem genui, participem regni feci, successorem
declaravi, contra jus Gentium, adversus jus naturae et sanguinis
necessitudinem, contra divinum edictum, immemor beneficiorum, oblitus naturae,
non solum dignitate, sed et vita privare conatur parentem, cui vitam,
dignitatem, quicquid denique habet acceptum refer necesse est, extinguere
con^ititur, Countess Machtylda.
Dux facti foemina est: diutius quam filio placet me Deus servat, vitam quam
natura mihi donat, proles mea mihi invidet. Expectare semis fata recusat. Quae
sane nostrae sunt injuriae nihil ad vos. Verum nunc vestrum duce foemina
occupavit regnum, vi and armis tenet. Vos in mea injuria despecti estis, vestra
beneficia mihi excepta sunt, non me, sed vos contemnit. Vestra res agitur,
audaciam hominum spectate. Non opus est malis geniis, homini ex homine plurima
mala; Vni animalium, homini, ambitio honoris, avaritiae immensa cupido; nulli
rerum major libido, nulli rabies acrior. Quid reliquum est, nisi ut caeteri
omnes, ab hoc, quasi in loco illustri constituti, exempla sibi sumant,
parricidia passim impune committant! Si ulla apud vos est memoria Conradi avi,
atque Henrici parentis mei, majorumque vestrorum, nolite pati Imperium vestro
sanguine atque sudore partum, per scelus et parricidia tabescere; per
amplitudinem, salutemque vestram, per immortalem majorum gloriam obsecro,
auferte procul in ultimas terras ex Germaniae victrice Gentium flagitium hocce,
hactenus inauditum. Defessum tot civilibus praeliis Orbem Romanum asserite a
vitiis, scelere immanissimo Rempublicam Christianam vindicate; poenas
impietatis scelerati reddant, sentiant sacrilegi impostores, Germanicam
virtutem nondum a majoribus degenerasse, vos Majorum vestigiis inniti decet,
terrori pessimis, quibusque bonis patrocinio esse. Quod tum fiet si uno
consensu filium meum minorem natu, majore ob scelera exhaeredato atque
proscripto, Caes^rem declaraveritis. Haec ubi Augustus dixit, pauci, quibus
omnia alia atque sides and Respub. chariora erant, contra nitebantur, Caeteri
omnes indignitate facinoris^commoti, aequa postulare Augustum censent, ejusque*
postulatis annuunt ex consilii decreto: more majorum Hainricum filium Augustum
impuberem adhuc Caesarem consalutant, isque se nunquam a patre defecturum
solenni ritu jurat. Jamque Civil bellum, parricidialisque pugna parabatur.
Imperator cum exercitu in Italiam intrat, Nordmannos, Machtyldam atroci proelio
superat, Castella, oppida, vicos, Mantuam, Florentiam obsidet, expugnat, capit.

Pope Urban continued at Rome Anno 1098. maintaining wars and contests both
there and in Italy with Clement his Competitor: Anno 1098, 1099.
at last having manfully enough either appeased or finally conquered most of
his Enemies, Anno 1099. Romae Dominus Papae generalem Synodum 150. Episcoporum

this reiteration of them?) Statuit quoque ibi, ne communicare praesumerent, qui

An. 1099. Urbanus Papa 3. Ebdomada Paschae magnum Concilium tenuit Romae: In
quo recisis recidendis and statutis statuendis, in adversarios sanctae
Ecclesiae Excommunicationis sententiam in omnes laicos investitaras Ecclesiarum
dantes, et omnes easdem investitu^as de manibus illorumaccipientes, nec non
omnes in officio sic dati honoris hujusmodi consecrantes, cum toto Concilio
Papa intorsit; Eosque Anatheniatis vinculo colligavit, qui pro Ecclesiasticis
honoribus Laicorum hominum homines fiunt, dicens, Nimis execrabile videri, ut
manus quae in tantam eminentiam excreverant, ut quod nulli Angelorum concessum
est, Deum cuncta creantem, suo signaculo creent, et eundem ipsum pro
redemptione, et salute totius mundi summi Dei Patris optutibus offerunt, in
hanc ignorantiam detrudantur, ut ancillae fiant earum manuum quae die ac nocte
obscaenis contactibus inquinantur, sive rapinis, ac injustae sanguinum
effusioni addictae, commaculantur. Which blasphemous reasons being uttered,
Fiat, fiat, ab omnibus est acclamatum, and in his Concilium consummatum.

The Emperors Henry the 3. and 4. notwithstanding all Hildebrands, Urbans, and
other Decrees against Simony, would not part with, but still maintained and
exercised their ancient Right of Investitures, in conferring Bishoprics; and
the Papacy it self, according to the forecited Decrees of Popes themselves,
used by their Predecessors, as these Presidents in the eleventh Century after
Christ (when Investitures were most eagerly decryed, decreed against,) will
evidence, besides others which I pretermit.

of Trent, Echardus Bishop of Brixia, and Eugelbertus of Minden. Anno 1056. he
ordained Gomradus Bishop of Nemets, and Hermannus Archbishop of Agrippinae.
Anno 1060. he made Sigefridus Archbishop of Colen, Euchardus Bishop of Nemeri,

which he constituted Henry de Werle, Bishop of Padeborn, Udo Bishops of

Hildebrandian and Rodulphian Competitors, but prevailed against them in
conclusion. Anno 1084 he deposed Adelbero Bishop of Wirtzburgh, for adhering to
the Pope against his allegiance, and placed Meginhardus in his See, who being
violently dispossessed thereof by Adelbero, the Emperor again ejected this
intruder and re-placed Meg^^hardus in the Bishopric; yea he deprived no less
than 14. German Archbishops and Bishops for their rebellions against him at
once, and put others in their places, by his Imperial power, as I have Here, p.

already evidenced.

Pope Cl^^ment notwithstanding all the excommunications denounced against him
by Urban, would not quit his Right to the Papacy, nor the Emperor his
Prerogative of conferring Bishoprics and Churches by Investitures; But on the
contrary, this very year, Cardinal Benno, with others of the Emperors and
Clements party, meeting in a Synod of Rome, after many admonitions and summons
to Urban and his schismatical Party to appear before them, and renounce their
seditious, turbulent, schismatical Practices, Heresies, and sophistications,
denounced this ensuing sentence against them as incorrigible Schismatics and
Heretics, and ordered all their Decrees made in their forecited Councils at
Platentia, Claremont, Rome, and elsewhere, to be publicly burnt as heretical;

Paschalis 2. Papa ordinatur, and he ex divina revelatione factum ub^^ue
divulgabatur. Ordinatus est autem a Clero and Populo, as Bertoldus relates. But
Aventinus and others record, that Conradus filius Imperatoris Rex Italiae, and
Romani eum Pontificem maximum faciunt, (not the Cardinals) in opposition to his
Father. This Pope (Hildebrands Disciple) endeavored not only to unitate and
equal, but exceed him in antichristian Pride, Tyranny, Usurpations, Treasons,
Rebelsions against the Emperor Henry the 4th. Hic superbissimus Nebulo, (as
Platina, Stella, Onuphrius, Balaeus, and others assure us) sellam Pontificam
ascendere noiuit prius quam populus ter acclamasset: Sanctus Petrus Raynerum
virum optimum elegit. Indutus deinde coccinea chlamyde? (juxta illud Apoc. 1.
and mulier erat circundata purpura and coccino, etc.) thiaraque capiti ejus
imposita, deducebatur a bo equo vectus in Lateranum, ubi Pontificum Sceptrum
illi dabatur, ac baltheo cingebatur; de quo claves septem (Saint Peter had but
two at most) and totidem sigilla dependebant, tanquam papicae potestatis
symbola, quibus jus datum esse significabat, secundum septitariam Spiritus
sancti gratiam, Ecclesias claudendi and aperiendi: O abominatio inaudita: ita
se exaltabat magnus ille Dei adversarius and Antichristus; writes Balaeus: Hoc
modo (ait Functius) eques Meretrix virilem a ^atem fastu rexit, ut praedictum
est, Apoc. 13. and 17. Ad Herman. Appendix.
Bertoldus Constantiensis, who writ in that age, Anno 1100. observes: Jam
multum paene ubique sententia excommunicationis caepit tepescere, ut etiam
quidam religiosi, qui usque ad hoc tempus in illa causa fuerunt serventissimi a
Catholicis discederent, et inter excommunicatos promoveri non timerent: (The
frequency and contrariety of these Papal brutish, malicious sentences, making
them both contemptible and execrable to most:) Sed sancta Ecclesia in
obedientia circa excommunicatos nihilominus perstitit, quae post apostasiam
Judae, reliquos Apostolos etiam sirnaus, cum Domino pershtisse cognovit. This
Pope, as the Historians of that age, with Platina, B^lae^s, Barnes, and others
observe, (to evidence himself the true Successor of Hild^brand, not of St.
Peter) Totum vitae cursum in bellis gerendis ac seditionibus absolvit, hic
summus in terris Satanae Vicarius. Et ne ulla in reimpu^simo (...) haberetur
inferior, omnia experiebatur quae ad amplitudinem Satanicae sedis pertinere
videbantur: Episcopos omnes atque Abbates, a Caesare constitutos, sedibus
furiose deposuit. Theodoricum, quem Cavenses Pontificem designaverant, coegit
quar^o ferme mense post Electionem Papatum deponere, and habitum Anachoritae
suscipere: Mag i^lphum Romanum Civem apud Ravennates sibi arrogantem Pontificis
titulum, in exilium pepulit, and auxiliantibus Romany urbe ejecit. In
Guibertum Antipapam, exercitum mover, Rogerii Siciliae comitis copiis and
opibus adjutus, qui videns se viribus imparem esse Paschali, profugit in
tutiorem locum, and non multo post subitanea morte opetit grandaevus. Quidam
scribant, hunc suasu quorundam bonorum se abdicasse suo Pontificatu. Alii
scr^bunt, eum eodem die ejectum and relegatum esse. This Martial Pope Paschal

the occasion of his summoning this Council is very observable; Episcopus
Florentinus, as most, (but Fluentinus, as Sabellicus) styles him; audebat palam
asseverare, Antichristum jam natum esse: Idque hand dubie animadvertit ex illo
horribili Metamorphosi regni Christi spiritualis in mundanum. Nam Pontifices
Remani magis arma quam Biblia sacra tractabant, opponebant sese Imperatoribus,
eosque contemptissime tractabant, articulos fidei depravabant, Sacramenta a
Christo sancita prophanabant, etc. Plures ad Pontificatum insidiis, armis, ac
caedibus ascendebant, quam libera electione, and castitas, quae etiam in
honesto conjugio colitur, ex tota quasi choro sacratorum viroum exterminabatur.
Erat denique Romanus Papa vorago pecuniarum totius mundi, vi, non ratione
pleraque administrans. Ista quidem huic Antistiti and aliis praesentem
Ecclesiae statum nonnihil perpendentibus occasionem praebuerunt, jam
evidentissimis and illustribus notis affirmandi, Antichristum jam esse natum;
publiceque in Ecclesia dominari, (being likewise seconded with many prodigies,
at large related by Historians, happening at this season.) Hac re divulgata
Paschalis 2. vicem Antichristi Romae gerens, (conscious of his own guilt)
nequaquam sibi dorm^endum praesumebat; sed confestim Florentiae ^cacto Concilio
Episcoporum Galliae and Italiae, Episcopum ad examen vocat. Re ipsa admodum
discusia (silentium autem de argumentis ipsius altum est, nec enim visa est ex
re Pontificis Romani, si rations in vulgus sparsae, aut memoriae fuissent
commendatae.) Hoc tantum asserunt, hominem verbis castigatum ac dimissum esse:
Credibile est, verbis satis indignis. And to show himself a true Antichrist, as
Dr. Barnes and others relate, Perpetuum Anathema a Gregorio adversus Henricum
4. promulgatum in ca Synodo renovat et confirmat, ejusque Synodi sententiam
postea in coena Domini, apud Lateranum Romae public pronunciat.

Immediately after, (as Platina, Barnes and others story) ad Guardastalum,
conventis multorum Principum et Episcoporum habito, de homagiis, de feudis, de
Episcoporum Sacramentis Laicis antea exhibitis, exhibendisve, magna est habita

Ita^iam propere rediit, quod intellexerat omnia seditiosorum quorundam
factionibus perturbari: Several persons seizing upon St. Peter's patrimony, and
raising parties against this Paschal, who like a Martial Pontiff, encountered
his Enemies in the field, obstinate resistentes expugnat, non sine magno
utriusque partis incommodo; oppida quae jam defecerant, in deditionem recipit,
and totum Petri patrimonium brevi pacatum reddidit. This year Conrade the

ita and connubio conjunctus) died in rebellion; being poisoned, as some
relate; whereupon this Pope endeavored to engage his Son Henry (whom his
Father had declared to succeed him in the Empire in a public assembly of the
States, and all the Hildebrandian faction to depose, and usurp his Fathers
throne by force and treachery: For which end, Pope Paschal Anno 1102. summoned
a General Council at Rome, wherein he resumed the old quarrel about
Investitures, passing this Decree therein, and other subsequent Councils; (thus
registered by Gratian, cause. 16. qu 7.) Si quis Clericus, Abbas vel Monachus per
Laicos Ecclesias obtinuerit, secundum Sanctorum Apostolorum Canones, (to wit of
Urban and Hildebrand) and Antiochieni Concilii capitalium, excommunicetur.
Constitutiones Sanctorum canonum sequent^s (of Hildebrand and Urban) Statuimus,
ut quicumque Clericus ab hac hora investituram Ecclesiae, vel Ecclesiasticae
dignitatis de manu Laici acceperit, et qui ei manum imposuerit, gradus sui
periculo subjaceat. Nullus Laicorum, Ecclesias vel Ecclesiarum bona occupat vel
disponat, qui vero secus egerit ab Ecclesiae liminibus arceatur: ratifying all
his Predecessors forecited Decrees against Investitures. Henry the Emperor
having notice of the Popes intention and designs to call this Council; Habito
cum Principibus colloquio, Roman se profecturum, ac Generale Concilium circa
Febr. Kalend. inibi convocaturum (according to his Imperial Privilege to
summon Councils, of which this Pope would deprive him) condirit; quatenus tam
sua, quam Domini Apostolici causa canonice ventilata, Catholica inter Regnum et
Sacerdotium confirmaretur unitas. Constat tamen nec ipsum juxta placitum
venisse, nec nuncia dignitati Apostolicae subjectonem profitentia misisse (as
he had no reason) Nec hoc latet, quod alterum Papam ipsi Domino Paschali
superponeret (he being unduly elected without his Imperial assent, by the power
and confederacy of his rebellious usurping Son Conrade) si fieri posset,
conatus sit: The ground of his absenting himself, was, his just fear of the
Popes treachery and designs to dethrone or murder him, to establish himself in
his usurped Papal Chair. Whereupon this Pope taking advantage of his absence,
convententibus universis Apuliae, Campaniae, Siciliae, Tuscaniae totiusque
simul Italiae Praesulibus, Ultramontanorum autem quamplurimorum Legatis (all or
most of the Hildebrandian faction) Synodus magna Romae est habita; ubi praeter
antiqua Patrum instituta (to wit against Investitures) more solita reverenter
confirmata, etiam saepedictum hujus temporis Schisma, inter pr^^cipuas haereses
computatur, ac perpetuo cum suis authoribus atque sequacibus anathemate
hujusmodi subscripta professione condemnatur.

Anathematizo omnem haeresim, and praecipue eam, quaestatum praesentis
Ecclesiae perturbat; quae docet and asserit Anathema contemnendum, and
Ecclesiae ligamenta spernenda esse: (And to make sure his Title, superadded

vel Patricium Romanum Heinricum idem Apostolicus Paschalis promulgaverit, (by
no Apostolical president) nos quoque inter innumeras diversarum Gentium
catervas, proxima coena Domini in Ecclesia Lateranensi ab ipsius ore didicimus;
Nimirum, postquam 8. Kalend. Octobris maris fluctibus Joppae traditi Romae
sumus, per gratiam Christi praedicta majore hebdomada intro^ucti. Quia, inquit,

Gregorio Papa, deinde a sanctissimo viro Vrbano predecessore meo propter suam
inobedientiam excommunicatus est atque condemnatus; Nos quoque in proxima
Synodo nostra judicio totius Ecclesiae, perpetuo eum anathemate tradidimus. Id
notum volumus omnibus, et maxim Vltramontanis esse, quatenus se ab ipsius
contineant iniquitate. After this Excommunication the Pope dispatcheth his
Legates and Letters into Germany, exciting Princes and Prelates of the
Hildebrandian faction to take up arms afresh, against the re-excommunicated
Emperor and all his adherents. Amongst others he sent one Letter to Robert Earl
of Holland, newly returned from the wars against the Saracens in the holy Land,
to this effect. Platina in Gregorio 7. Sabellicus Aenead. 9. l. 4: 4. Morney
hist. Papatus, p. 275.
Hoc est legitimi militis, ut sui Regis hosts instantius persequatur. Gratias
ergo prudentiae tuae agimus, quod praeceptum nostrum in Came^acensi parochiae
executus es, id ipsum de Leodiensibus excommunicatis Pseudoclericis praecipimus
(who adhered faithfully to the excommunicated Emperor) Nec in hac tantum part,
sed ubique cum poteris, Henricum haereticorum caput, et ejus fautores pro
viribus persequaris. Nullum profecto gratius Deo sacrificium offerre poteris,
quam si eum impugnes, qui se contra Deum erexit, qui Ecclesiae Dei regnum
auferre conatur, etc. Hoc tibi et Militibus tuis in peccatorum remissionem
pricipimus, etc. Hereupon the Bishop, Canons and Clergy of the Diocese and
Church of Leodium, in their own just defense writ a memorable answer to this
Popes Letter, wherein they thus notably oppugned his antichristian proceedings
against the Emperor, and his adherents, oppugn his pretended Supremacy,
Tyranny, Bloodthirstinesse, vindicate this Emperors cause supremacy over Popes,
Prelates, prove Rome to be Babylon, and the Pope Antichrist.

Stupendo and gemendo ex^^la^o (inquit Ecclesia Leodiensis) cum Esia, In 2.

qui onus de^^^^ exaggerans, exclamat, sicut turbines ab Africo veniunt, de
deserto venit, de terra horribili vuio dura nunciata est mihi, etc. Qui
hactenus non intelligebat loquendo, quid sit desertum mare, nunc intelligat
videndo, quid per desertum mare significetur; non solum Babylonia, sed etiam
mundus and Ecclesia, etc. Ecclesia (...) se desertam a sano praesulum consilio.
Quae enim major olim confusio fuit in Babylonia, quam hodie est in Ecclesia? In
Babylonia confusae sunt lingua gentium, in Ecclesia dividuntur linguae and
mentes credentium. Ait Petrus in Epistola sua, Sa^^ta^ vos Ecclesia quae est in
Babylone collecta, Hactenus interpretabar ideo voluisse Patrum per Babylo^em
s^g^are Romam, quia tunc temporis Roma confusa erat Idolo^atria and omni
spurcitia. At nunc dolor meus mihi interpretatur; quod Petrus Prophtico spiritu
dicens Ecclesiam in Babylone collectam, praevidit confusionem dissens^on^s,
quia hodie scinditur Ecclesia, etc. Qui sint turbines ab Africo, discimus
patiendo magis quam legendo, de terra horribili, a Romana scilicet Ecclesia,
visio dura nunciata est mihi; inde turbo ut tempestas venit ab Africo Romanus
enim pra sul, pater omnium Ecclesiarum literas contra nos mittit Roberto
Flandrensium Comiti, et earum hic exemplar interserunt. Super his literis cujus
lumbi non repleantur dolor? Super h^s me obstupefecerunt tenebrae, nec tantum
pro horrore periculi, quantam pro horrenda novitate rei, quam tam lachrymabiles
literae potuerunt scribia Matre contra filas suas, 1 Reg. 3
quamvis peccantes. In judicio Salomonis expressa est magnitudo materna
pietatis, quoniam judicante Solomone, ut infans pro quo contendebatur, gladio
divideretur maluit matter filium suum sub aliena muliere vivere, ^sa^a. 21.
quam gladio judicis dividi. Dicit Esaias, Babylon dilecta mea, versa est mihi
in miraculum. At ego dico, Roma dilecta mea matter, versa est mihi in miraculum.
Quid enim tam mirabile, 2 Samuel 24
imo quid tam miserabile? Vidit olim David Angelum Dei stantem exten^o gladio
super Jerusalem, nos filiae Romanae Ecclesiae, Ecce videmus Romanum pr^es^em,
qui est Angelus Domini (hunc utique locum occupat,) extento gladio super
Ecclesiam. Davia orabat ne populus occideretur; angelus noster porrigens
Roberto gladium, (...). 21
orat ut occidamur. Unde iste gladius angelo nostro? Unus est gladius spiritus,
quod est verbum Dei, etc. Est alter gladius spiritualis, quo mortificatis vitus
carnis emitur corona martyrii. Cum ergo duos tantum gladios a Domino Apostoli
habeant, unde iste tertius Apostolico gladius, quem in nos porrigit Robe^to
armigero suo? Forte recurrit Apostolicus ad Ezechielem Prophetam, ut de manu
ejus tertium arripiens gladium, vadat ad dextram, sive ad siniseram, caedendo
bonos and malos, etc. Hic est gladius interfectionis magnae, qui me cum
Ezechiel^ obstupescere facit; quem enim non faciat cord tabescere, quod
Apostolicus ad vivisicandum unctus, accingitur in nos tertio gladio
interfectorum, etc. Si licere dicere (salva Apostolicae dignitatis reverentia)
ipse nobis videtur dormivisse. Dormierunt cum eo omnes consiliarii ejus, quando
conduxit sibi vastatorem Ecclesiarum Dei. Tit. 2. 1.
Pracipit Paulus, ut verbum Episcopi sit sanum and irreprehensibile. Nos ergo
nec infirmamus aut reprehendimus verbum Episcoporum Episcopi, sed quia
Apostolicus non debet deviare ab Apostolo, quaerimus humiliter per singula,
utrum hac Apostolici verba sint per omnia gravitate Apostolicae authoritatis
sana and irreprehen^^bilia? Ecce ut pater dilecto filio salutem mittit, and
apostolicam benedictonem promittit! Sed non ea illa opera indicit, quibus
salutem and benedictionem a Deo promereri possit, etc. Quis unquam populum Dei,
quis unquam Ecclesiam Dei impune persecutus est? (Et huc multa ex Scripturis
sucris exempla adducunt.) Ecce opera justae malitiae, quibus pater filium, Papa
coelestis Regis militem imbuit, per quae possit contendere ad coelestem
Jerusalem, impugnando scilicet Ecclesiam Dei. Gratias, inquit, prudentiae tuae
agimus, quod praeceptum nostrum in Cameracensi parochia executus es; Qualis and
quanta sit vastitas and contritio Cameracensis Ecclesiae, quis recolit sine
dolor? Ego quidem silia Romanae Ecclesiae, condolebam Camera^^^sibus pro
affectu germanitatis, nunc vero audiens haec mala inferri praecepto Apostolicy
authoritatis, jam amplius doleo, quia timeo Matri meae, ne in eam redundet
illud quod Deus dicit per os Esaiae, Isay 10. 1.
Vae qui condunt leges iniquas, and scribentes injustitiam scripserunt, ut
opprimerent in judicio pauperes, etc. Tantam Ecclesiae desolationem, tantam
pauperum and viduarum oppressionem, tantam praedarum and rapinarum immanitatem,
and quod his gravius est, promiscuam bonorum and malorum occitionem; Haec and
pejora his praecepto Apostolici facta esse quis crederet, nisi ipse suo ^^^ore
prodidisset? Nos attoniti hac novitate rerum, quaerimus unde sit hoc novum
exemplum, ut praedicator pacis, suo ore and alterius manu, inferat Ecclesiae
bellum, etc. Apostolici enim peccantes arguunt, 2 Timothy 4
Obsecrant, Matthew. 18
increpant, in omni patientia and doctrina etc. Dicit Jesus, Si peccaverit inte
frater tuus, corripe illum, etc. Et hic exemplum Gregorii erga Episcopem
Salonensem proferunt, Imperatorem Maximum arguentem, quod in Priscilliani
sectatores vim adhiberet; Qui damnavit, inquit, accusatorem Itachium pro morte
haeretici, si adhuc viveret, non laudaret and istum, cujus praecepto tot
occiduntur pro causa Cameracensium, etc. Idipsum de Leodiensibus excommunicatis
pseudoclericis praecipimus, inquit, Nos vero Leodienses quare excommunicati
dicimur, in uno Spiritu nos omnes, in unum corpus baptizati sumus, etc. Quando
significatum est Romanae Ecclesiae quod contentiones fuerit inter nos, idipsum
in Christo sapimus, 1 Cor. 1. 12.
idipsum dicimus, Non dicimus, Ego sum Pauli, ego Cephae, ego autem Christi;
number quid pro hac unanimitate excommunicati dicimur, etc. Nobis legem Dei
tenentibus objiciunt, quod transgrediamur eorum novas traditiones. At illis
dicit Deus, Quare vos transgredimini mandatum Dei propter traditiones vestras?
Jubet Deus, Mat. 15. 2, 3.
ut quae sunt Caesaris, reddamus Caesari, and quae sunt Dei, Deo. In hanc
sententiam Petrus and Paulus pedibus eunt. Mat. 22. 21
Petrus inquit, Deum timete, honorisicate Regem. Servi subditi estote in omni
timore dominis, non tantum bonis and modestis, 1 Pet. 2 17, 18
sed etiam dyscolis, etc. Qui hoc omni animae praecepit, quem a subjectione
terrenae potestatis excepit? Quia ergo Regem honoramus, quia Dominis nostris
non ad oculum, sed in plicitate cordis servimus, ideo excommunicati dicimur?
Sed Simoniaci sumus. Simomoniacos, quantum ad nos, vitamus, and quos vitare
nequimus, pro loco and tempore toleramus, nec minus vitamus illos, qui notam
avaritiae honesto nomine praetexentes, quod gratis se jactant dare, vendunt sub
charitatis nomine, and sicut Montanistae sub nomine oblationum artificiosius
accipiunt munera; Oh dolendo miramur, quare, quando and a quo excommunicati
simus. Non ab Episcopo nostro, non ab Archiepiscopo, cui Episcopus noster
suffragatur, nos excommunicatos esse scimus. Sed nec a Papa Romano nos esse
excommunicatos credimus; quia scimus eum non ignorare quod ait Nicodemus,
Johann. 7.
Lex nostra non judicat quemquam nisi andierit ab ipso prius. Nec Sodomitas
damnasset Deus, Genes. 18
nisi descendisset ad ipsos, videre, utrum clamorem, qui venerat ad eum, opere
complessent. Qui nihil a nobis audivit, quem non Episcopus, non Archiepiscopus
aliquando contra nos interpellavit, quis crederet quod nos excommunicaverit?
etc. Credo dicetis nos ideo haberi excommunicatos, quia favemus Episcopo
nostro, faventibus partibus domini sui Imperatoris. In hac re sunt initia
dolorum, pro hac re erubescunt causae malorum, quia Satanas solutus terram
perambulans, jam divisit regnum and Sacerdotium; Quia ergo Diabolus venit ad
nos habens iram magnam, Apocal. 20
Patrem nostrumqui est in coelis oramus pro hocspecialiter, ne nos inducat in
tentationem hanc, sed liberet nos a malo hujus tentationis, etc. Quis jure
reprehendet, quod Episcopus partibus Domini sui favet, cui promissam cum
juramento fidelitotem debet? etc. Hoc non ignorant illi qui regnum and
Sacerdotium scindentes novello schismate, et novellis traditionibus, illos qui
Regi perjurant, se a culpa perjurii absolvere promittunt, etc. Hinc omnes
perpendite, quis sit reus capitis, qui non reddit Caesari quae sunt Caesaris
secundum Decretum Dei. vel qui Regem inhonorat contra Decretum Apostoli, vel
perjuraudo assumit nomen Dei in vanum, per quod juravit Regi fidelitatem. Ecce
quare excommunicati dicimur. Sed quare pseudoclerici vocamur, qui canonice
viventes, operibus meremur, ut Clerici vocemur? Non est inquam de sort Dei,
(alludens ad vocem (...)) qui vult nos excludere a sort Dei; (ac proinde
Paschalem, qua in part collocat) Evomuit cor Paschasii vile convicium, 1 Pet.

prout vetulae and textrices faciunt. Petrus Apostolus docet, Gal. 4. 19:
non dominantes in Clero, sed forma facti gregis. Paulus Apostolus, filioli
quos iterum parturio in Domino; Hos igitur attendat Dominus Paschasius pios
admonitores, non impios conviciatores. Maledictum excommunicationis Dominus
Paschasius nobis imporperat, sed illud ante omnes timemus, quod Spiritus
sanctus per os Psalmistae dicit, Psalm. 119. 21.
Maledicti omnes qui declinant a mandatis tuis; Maledictum excommunicationis,
quod ex novella traditione Hildebrandus, Odardus and iste tertius indiscrete
protulerunt, omnino abjicimus, and priores Patres sanctos usque nunc veneramur
and tenemus, qui dictante Spiritu sancto, non animi motu, in majoribus and
minoribus potestatibus graviter delinquentibus, quaedam dissimulaverunt,
quaedam correxerunt, and quaedam toleraverunt. Dominus noster Episcopus
communicate Regi and Imperatori suo, cui ex Regalibus ejus acceptis fidelitatem
juravit Nimium effurit tempus, quo haec consuetudo incoepit, and sub hac
consuetudine migraverunt a saeculo sancti et reverendi Episcopi, reddentes
Caesari quae erant Caesaris, and Dio quaerant Dei. (Hicque multos ex Ambrosio
and Augustino loces adducunt.) Ecce, inquit, quare excommunicati vocamur, eo
quod sanctos et moderatos et antiquos Patres tenemus, et pro posse imitamur.
Episcopum, Archiepiscopum nostrum, provincialem and comprovincialem Synodum ex
antiqua traditione tenemus; and quicquid ibi de Scripturis definitum fuerit,
Romam non refertur, usque ad graviora negotia, de quibus non inventur in
Scripturis sanctis authoritas. Illos vero Legatos a Latere Romani Episcopi
exeuntes, and ad ditanda marsupia discurrentes, omnino refutamus, Nota,
sicut temporibus Zozami, Coelestini, Bonifacii Concilia probaverunt. Etenim ut
a fructibus eoru^ cognoscamus eos, non morum correctio, non vitae emendatio,
sed inde hominum caedes, and Ecclesiarum Dei proveniunt depraedationes. Quia
igitur antiquae regulae inhaeremus, and non omni vento doctrinae circumferimur,
ecce unde excommunicati dicimur? Cur Paschasius vult, ut exolvamus quod non
rapuimus? ut pseudoclerici vocemur, ubi rectam lineam tenemus? Potius deposito
spiritu prae sumptionis, cum suis consiliariis solerter recolligat, quomodo a
beato Sylvestro usque ad Hildebrandum sedem Romanam Papae obtinuerint, and quot
et quanta inaudita exambitione illius sedis perpetrata sint, et quomodo per
Reges Imperatores definita sint, et pseudo papae daminati et abdicati sint, et
ibi plus valuit virtus Imperialis, quam excommunicatio Hildebrandi, Gal. 2. 11.
Odardi, Paschasii, etc. Paulus Apostolus in faciem Petro Principi Apostolorum
restitit. Ergo remoto Romanae ambitionis typo, ^ur de gravibus et manifestis
non reprehendantur et corrigantur Romani Episcopi? Qui reprehendi and corrigi
non vult, pseudo est sive Episcopus, sive Clericus; Nos vero qui per
misericordiam Dei, juxta regulam obedientes and corrigibiles sumus, and
schisma, and simoniam, and excommunicationem per omnia dictante ratione and
Spiritu sancto vitare volumus, etc. Quae etsi devastanda essent, edicto Regum
et Imperatorum devastari deberent, qui non sine causa gladium portant. Sed
solutus est Satanas habens iram magnam, quem exterreat valida manus Dei, (ad
Ecclesiam in Apocalypsi alludens, Apocal. 22. v. 1. and 12.
quam Satan persequitur;) Nos ab excommunicatione excipiet ipsa Romanorum
authoritas. Hildebrandus Papa, qui author est hujus novelli schismatis, and
primus levavit Sacerdotalem lanceam contra diadema regni, primo indiscrete
Henrico faventes excommunicavit, sed reprehendens se intemperantiae excepit ab
excommunicatione illos, qui Imperatori adhaerebant necessaria and debita
subjectione, non voluntate faciendi vel conciliandi malum; Et hoc pro decreto
scripsit, etc. Excutit inde amplius Paschalis ad Robertum Epistolae verba;
Henricum haereticorum caput and ejus fautores persequere; nullum profecto Deo
gratius sacrificium offerre poteris, etc. Cum Alaricus Rex Gotthorum iret ad
capiendam Romam, monitus a quodam servo Dei, ut ab his malis cessaret, non
volens, inquit, vado Romam; vir enim quidam me quotidie torquens urget, ut eam
ad destruendam Romam; Hoc exemplo urget Apostolicus armigerum suum, ut totum
depopuletur regnum, quod non potest fieri sine caede and sanguine, and
Ecclesiarum Dei depopulatione. Alaricus in hoc quidem mitior fuit, qui capta
Roma Ecclesiis Dei pepercit; and a caede hominum abstinuit; nunc nihil excepto,
immittitur Robertus ab Apostolico, ut non solum in Cameracenses and nos
Leodienses, sed totus feratur ad dispergendos omnes. Isa. 52. 7.
Quis clamabit modo cum Esaia, Quam pulchri super montes pedes praedicantis and
annunciantis pacem, etc. Mat. 26. 51, 52:
Qualem zelum habuit Petrus in amputanda auricula Malchi, talem zelum habet
modo Vicarius Petri in amputanda auricula Regis haeretici; sed qui in feriendo
Petrum imitatur, etiam in recondendo gladio Petrum imitetur, etc. Esto,
concedimus vobis inviti eum talem esse qualem dicitis, nec talis a nobis
repellendus esset, armis contra eum sumptis, sed precibus ad Deum fusis. Contra
Pharaonem cujus cor contra Deum induravit, Exodus c. 6, etc.
Moses, ranam, muscam, locustam, grandinemque induxerat; has tantum plagas non
nisi orando extensis in coelum manibus, avertere potuit; Jeremias pro
Nabuchodonozor, and Paulus pro Nerone orant, etc. (Et haec exempla latius
exporrigit.) Quis Pontificum Romanorum suis unquam decretis authorizavit, ut
debeat Pontifex gladio belli in peccantes uti? Greg. l. 7. Regist. c. 1.
Gregorius primus hujus nominis Papa quid omnes ante se Papae, super hoc
senserint, and quid omnes post se sentire debeant, ostendit, scribens Sabiniano
Diacono, etc. Hoc exemplo omnes a primo Gregorio contenti, utebantur solo
gladio spirituali, usque ad ultimum Gregorium, qui primus se et suo exemplo
alios Pontifices contra Imperatorem accinxit gladio belli, etc. Dicitis cum
Gregorio, quoquo modo liget pastor, timeat grex vinculum pastoris; Dicimus and
nos cum Gregorio, ligandi and solvendi potestate se private, qui subjectos pro
suo velle and non pro merito eorum, ligat and solvit. Dicitis, quoque modo
excommunicatur, si morte praevenitur, damnatur. Hic nobis succurrit Romanae
Ecclesiae authoritus; Gregorius enim primus scripto and facto exauctoravit,
quod potest Romanus Pontifex absolvere excommunicatum in just ab aliquo; Si
hoc potest Romanus praesul, quis neget etiam Deum posse absolvere, si quem
praesul Romanus injuste excommunicaverit? Nemo enim potest ab alio laedi, nisi
prius laedatur a semetipso; nullum vero sacrificium Deo gratius offerre poterit
Robertus, quam si nos persequatur; Quaero a te, O matter mea Romana Ecclesia,
Number Deo placeat sacrificium, nisi sit mundum and immaculatum? Quale ergo and
quomodo tam gratum est Deo hoc bellandi Sacrificium (quod non potest fieri sine
macula culparum? (quod caput multis Scriptura locis explicat) Et hoc, inquit,
tibi ac militibus tuis in peccatorum remissionem praecipimus; Hic quid dicam,
nescio, quo me vertam, non video. Si enim utriusque legis totam bibliothecam,
si omnes totius bibliothecae veteres expositores revolvam, exemplum hujus
Apostolici praecepti non inveniam. Solus Hildebrandus Papa ultimam manum sacris
Canonibus imposuit, quem legimus praecepisse Mathildi Marchionissae in
remissionem peccatorum suorum, ut debellaret Henricum Imperatorem (Tumque ex
Scriptura and aliquot Gregorii locis, veram peccata remittendi rationem
edisserens, qua nemp: peccatori peccatum suum ob oculos ponitur, quod and
confiteatur and agnoscat, indeque and ejus gravitatem expendat, and dolor

Leodiensis Epistola his verbis;) Hunc morem discrete ligandi and solvendi

Unde ergo haec nova authoritas per quam reis sine confessione and poenitentia
offertur praeteritorum peccatotum immunitas and futurorum libertas? Quantam

This Pope after Conrades death, perceiving he could not work his design to
depose the Emperor (who upon Conrades long unnatural rebellion against him, had
declared his Son Henry Copartner with him in and Successor to the Empire; by
Decree of the German Princes) but by engaging Henry to revolt and take up arms
against his Father, as Conrade had done; by his Legate and Agents; persuaded
Henry (against his filial duty and express Oath, never to bear arms against his
Father) suddenly to desert and raise Forces both to imprison and dethrone him.
To prevent which design, Henry the Father, Anno 1103. published his intention
to leave the Government of the Empire wholly to his Son, and to take a voyage
to relieve the Holy land; whereby many were encouraged to accompany him
thither, and the malice of his enemies abated for the present, but he deferring
his expedition, thereupon An. 1105. his Son Henry by the advice of the Pope and
of some German Princes, and Prelates, rebellionem adversus Patrem in Boiaria
parat: most unnaturally departing privily from his Fathers side, as an Heretic
excomunicated by the Pope; soon after to engage all the Hildebrandian Papal
faction to side with him against his Father, Otto Frisurg. Chron. l. 7. c. ^

Primo haresin (Investiturarum) anathematizans, Apostolicae sedis Pontifici
debitam profit^tur obedientiam; indeque foederatis sibi Noricis principibus,
atque ab Alemannia, necnon ab Orientali Francia nonnullis Nobilibus, ad Saxones
con^enitur, (the old seditious Rebels) A quibus honorifice susceptus, in brevi
universis Saxoniae civitasibus potitus, and ab optimatibus est dignitate Regia
satis honoratus. Consilio tamen atque ministerio Ruothardi Moguntini atque
Gebehardi Constantiensis Episcopi (responsalium scilicet Domini Pascalis Papae,
being the Popes Legates and Commissioners) totam Saxoniam Romanae Ecclesiae
reconciliavit. After which this Usurper of his Fathers Throne by his new
Imperial authority, Episcopis atque Clericis Conventum generalem in villam
regiam, quae Northusam dicitur, quarto Calendas Junii indixit, ubi super
Ecclesiasticae institutionis jam depravata disciplina tractaretur. Convenit
igitur magnus Episcoporum Abbatum and Monachorum turba. In quo Concilio super
sententiis instantibus Patrum decretis primo relictis, quaecunque poterunt ad
praesens laudabiliter corrigebantur; quaedam vero quae and graviora videbantur,
ad Apostolicam audientiam differebantur: Simoniaca quippe haeresis Patrum
consuetudine condemnata ibid. ab omnibus condemnata. Deinde (as the Century
Writers observe) Investiturae jus totum Romano idolo consecrabant, et
involabant plenissimis oribus. Nam Henricus hactenus majorum authoritatem et
privilegia contra furorem Romanorum Praesulum tutatus fuerat. Et hac quidem in
part Henrici filius Papam omnium maxim fricare studebat, sed postea in
similes poenas justo Dei judicio incidit. Hoc igitur Investurae jes, quod sibi
politici arrogabant, per invidiam nonnulli Scriptores, and Papae, Simoniam
appellabant. His vero qui a Pseudo-Episcopis (as they deemed all who received
Investitures from the Emperor) fuerant consecrati, per Catholicam manus
impositionem reconciliatis, proximo ^ejunio danda fore promittitur, to
corroborate their ^action. This young Emperor Henry the 5th. counterfeited very
much humility and ingenuity in this Council, to indear himself to the Pope,
Prelates and Church. Nam cum servorum Dei conventui non ni^i vocatus interesse
vellet, tandem in abjecto productus habitu, locoque stans editiori, omnibus
juxta Principum decreta, suas leges atque jura rationabiliter renova^ it; si
qua vero irrationabilia rogabantur, mira and ultra suos annos prudenti
resposione, and avita magnanimitate confutavit. Christi Sacerdotibus dignam
exhibens reverentiam. Inter haec obortis lacrymis, ipsum regem coeli,
cunctamque militiam coeli testabatur, Se nulla regnandi cupiditate paternum
sibi Regnum usurpare, neque Dominum et Patrem suum a Romano deponi Imperio
exoptare; imo debitam pertinaciae and inobedientiae ejus semper compassionem
exhibere. Sique Sancto Petro suisque Successoribus lege Christiana sublici
velit, sive regno cedere, sive serviliter ipsi se subesse promisit. Quod
auditum omnis multitudo collandans, lachrymae simul and preces, tam pro Patris
conversione, quam prosilii presperitate funderecaepit, voce magna Kyrieel:
declamans. Eadem hora Uto Hildinisheimen^is and Henricus Paderburnensis, and
Fredericus Halberstatensis praesules vestigiis Metropolitani prostrati, ipsius
atque Regis stantis, totiusque praesentis Ecclesiae testimonio, Apostolicae se
dederunt obedientiae. Quorum etiam commissa Apostolico nihilominus judicio
reservantur, sub Officii sui tantum suspensione. After this, Henry the Son
raising an army against his Father, forcibly ejected the Bishops made by his
Father, who on the contrary opposed, despised the Bishops ordained by the Son.
After several bloody battles (one of them continued for three days) against
each other, to the great effusion of Christian blood, both parties referred
themselves to a Treaty of Peace in an Assembly of the German Princes and
Prelates to be held at Mentz: wherein the Emperor was to purge himself from the
Heresy objected against him by the Pope, and safe conducts were mutually
granted to each party to resort to that Synod without any peril either of life
or body: Eo jam Henricus 4. Imperator cum iret, a filio in itinere per insidias
contra sidem publicam datam, capitur, captus in communitissimum castrum
obducitur, non permittitur illi ut Comitia adeat. Henricus filius praesentibus
Pontificiis Legatis, Albano. Episcopo and Gebehardo Constantinensi Episcopo,
Comitia celebrat, patre captivo and excluso. Legati anathema a tot Pontificibus
in Henricum promulgatum, renovant, and iterum confirmant, and Imperium
impositione manuum conferunt silio. Henricum 4. ea lege libertati restituendum
esse statuunt, ut coram Legatis Pontificiis culpam suam confiteatur,
satisfactionemque promittat, and cedat filio regnum, cum omnibus Imperialibus
insigniis, corona, lancea, ^ceptro, globo, atque corona. The Emperor thereupon
writ one memorable Letter to his Son, another to Pope Paschal, complaining of
this his Treachery, Injustice, and against these inhuman proceedings, which you
may peruse in his Epistles; and this to the Bishops and Nobles of the Empire.

He likewise sent another Epistle to Pope Paschal; and Regi Celtarum, thus
complaining against the tyranny, treachery, injustice of the Pope and his own
Son, by his instigation.

injustam persecutionem in Apostol. sedem et omnem Ecclesiam hactenus
exercuisse. Tunc cum magna contritione animi prostratus coepi per Deum, per
ipsam conscientiam orare, ut locus et tempus mihi daretur, ubi in praesentia
omnium Principum, cum innocens essem, vellem ex judicio omnium me expurgare,
and in quo culpabilem me recognoscerent, ex consilio omnium sanioris sententiae
poenitentiam and satisfactionem, quo ordine juberent, quaerere, and in
principibus regni de fidelibus nostris, quoscunq, obsides vellent, dare. At
idem legatus locum et diem mihi abnegavit, dicens; aut tibi totum debere
determinari, aut nulla spes mihi esset evadendi. In tanto tribulationis
articulo, cum interrogarem, si confiterer omnia, quae imperabantur, an
confessio mea, ut justum est, veniam and absolutionem consequeretur? Ibi
legatus dixit, non esse juris sui me absolvere: Si vellem, inquit, absolvi,
Romam irem satisfacere Apostolicae Sedi. Sic desolatum and spoliatum (nam and
castella and patrimonia, and quicquid in regno conquisieram, eadem vi et art
sua extorrserant a me) in eadem villa reliquerunt me. In qua cum aliquo tempore
commoratus essem, and filius meus ex eodem fraudis suae consilio demandasset,
ut ibidem eum expectarem, superveniens quorundam fidelium meorum legatio

Hermoldus and Krantzius thus further relate.

Igitur ubi firmatus est Paschalis in sede, praecepit excommunicari Imperatorem
ab universis Episcopis et Catholicae Ecclesiae cultoribus, et eo usque
sententia hic invaluit, ut collecta Generali Curia, Principes Henrico Diadema
tollendum, et ad filium ejus aequivocum transferendum decernerent. Erat autem
idem jamdudum ex pertitione Patris designatus in Principem. Missi ergo a
Principibus venerunt ad Regem, qui tunc forte consistebat in corte regia
Hilgelsheim, Moguntinus, Coloniensis, Wormatiersis, and pertulerunt ad eum
mandatum ex ore Principum, dicentes; Fac nobis reddi coronam, annulum et
purpuram, caeteraque ad investituram Imperialem pertinentia, filio ejus
deferenda. Illo percunctante dejectionis suae culpam, responderunt dicentes;
Quid quaeris ea, quae optime nosti? Meministi qualiter universa Ecclesia tui
causa maximo schismatis errore multis jam annis laboraverit, qualiter
Episcopatus, Abbarias, praeterea omnia Ecclesiae regimina fecisti venalia, nec
fuit in constituendis Episcopis ulla legitimae Electionis facultas, sed sola
pecuniae ratio. Pro his and aliis causis sanxit authoritas Apostolica, favitque
Principum unanimitas, Te non solum regno, verum etiam Ecclesiastica communione
privandum. Purgatio, cum justissima petitione.
Quo contra Rex ait, Dicitis quia Spirituales dignitates precio vendiderimus;
Vestra quidem potestas est, tale nobis crimen impingere. Die ergo, O Moguntine,
dic adjuratus per nomen aeterni Dei, quid exegimus, aut recegimus, quando te
Moguntiae praefecimus? Tu quoque Coloniensis, per sidem te contestamur, quid
nobis dedisti pro sede, cui nostra munificentia praesides? Illis fatentibus
nihil pecuniae hujus rei gratia aut oblatum aut erceptum, Rex ait, Gloria Deo
in excelsis, quia vel in hac part fideles inventi sumus. Certe dignitates eae
duae praestantissimae sunt, and magnum quaelium Camerae nostrae refer
poterant. Porro Dominus Wormatiensis, qualis a nobis susceptus, ad quid
promotus, Pisi.
scilicet pietate, vel quaestu erga ipsum usi fuerimus, nec vos nec ipsum
latet. Condignam ergo beneficiis nostris rependitis gratiam? Nolite quaeso,
effici participes little, qui levaverunt manus adversus Dominum et Regem suum,
et temeraverunt fidem, et juramentorum Sacramenta. Ecce jam defecimus, parumque
nobis vitae
viae restat, senio and labor confectis: sustinete modicum, and nolite gloriam
nostram confusione terminare. Si autem nobis cedendum omnino esse dicitis, and
manet sixa sententia, praesigantur induciae, statuatur dies placiti, si Curia
adjudicaverit, filio nostro Coronam manibus propriis resignabimus. Generalem
itaque Cur^ae audientiam expetimus. Indigna Episcoporum pervicacia.
Illis e contrario Pathetica Caesaris Oration
nitentibus, and dicentibus, Se negotium pro quo missi fuerant, fortiter
expleturos, Rex parumper avulsus ab eis, fidelium suorum participavit consilio.
Vidensque quia Legati venissent stipati malitia, and non esset locus
resistendi, fecit sibi regiam exhiberi praeparaturam, qua indutus, and in sedem
receptus, legatos alloquitur dicens; Haec quidem Imperialis honoris insignia
mihi prestitit aeterni Regis pietas, et Principum regni electio concors. Potens
autem est Deus, qui me ad hoc culmen sua dignatione provexit, mihi conservare
quod concesserit, manusque vestras a coepto opere cohibere. Divino enim
praesidio nos enixius inniti oportet, omni scilicet militia and armis
destitutos. Hactenus quidem externis bellis impliciti, semper in custodiae
nostrae diligentia constitumus, omnes impugnationum jacturas, propitia
divinitate, partim consilio, partim virtute praelii evincentes. Hoc autem
intestinum malum sicut nec suspectum habuimus, ita nec praecavimus. Quis enim
in Orb Christiano tantum nefas consurgere crederet, ut jurata Principi
Sacramenta fidelitatis irritentur, suscitetur filius adversus patrem, postremo
nulla beneficiis gratia, honestati reverentia exhibeatur? Certe majestas
Imperatoria eam etiam erga hosts honestatis disciplinam servare consuevit, ut
proscribendis sive damnandis, vocationum sive judiciarium remedia non
negaverit, ante praemuniens quam feriens, prius invitans per gratiam, Nota:
quam damnans per sententiam. At nobis contra fas, vocationes et audientia
negantur. Ideoque praefocamur, ne audiamur. Quis tantam mentis alienationem a
fidissimis amicis, maxim vero a Pontificibus crederet? Dominum ergo factorem
Orbis vobis proponimus, ut ipsius terror vos coherceat, quos pietas non
revocat. Quod si nec Deum nec honestatem vestram reveremini, ecce praesentes
sumus, violentiam explodere non possumus, necessarium est vim sustinere, cui
refragari locus non est. Coeperunt ergo Pontifices haesitare quid agerent:
Magnarum enim rerum ingressus semper sunt difficiles. Tandem Moguntinus
allocutus est socios, dicens; Quousque trepidamus, Tragicus, conatus.
O Socii? Nonne Officii nostri est Regem consecrare, cosecratum investire? Quod
ergo Principum decreto impendere licet, eorundem authoritate tollere non licet?
Quem meritum investivimus, immeritum quare non divestiamus? (Brave Pontifical
doctrine!) Statimque accepto conamine, Regem aggressi sunt, eique coronam de
capite abripuerunt. Deinde subsatum de sede, purpura, caeterisque quae ad

vestrum, et praevaricati estis jusjurandum quod jurastis. Videat Dominus,
Caesaris exauctorati in adversarios dira.
et ulciscatur in vos, Deus, inquam, ultionum Dominus. Non consurgatis, neque
crescatis, neque prosperetur honor vester, sitque protio vestra cum co qui
tradidit Christum Dominum. At illi obturantes, aures suas, perrexerunt ad
filium, deserentes ei Imperialia, firmantesque eum in regnum. Surrexit ergo
Filius adversus Patrem, et expulit eum a regno: ille fugiens a facie silii sui,
pervented Ducatum, qui d^citur Linthburg, pergens and accelerans, ut evaderet
manus qua rentium animam ipsius. Erat autem in regione illa Princeps nobilis,
quem Caesar, adhuc sui Compos, ducatu de Linthburg destituerat, and alii
dederat. Accidit ergo, utidem Princeps sort venationi deditus, esset prope
viam cum Caesar transiret, comitatus viris novem, animadvertitque quia fugerat
a facie filii sui. Jam enim aliquid auditum fuerat. Sedensque in equo,
assumptis militibus insecutus est regem velocius. Quem videns Caesar, and
reputans hostem, Benevolentia in host.
coepit metuere de vita, and exclamans voce magna coepit postulare veniam. At
ille: Male, inquit, Domine, erga me meruistis, qui supplicanu quondam omnem
negastis gratiam, and abstulistis nulu ducatum meum. Hoc est, ait Caesar, quod
nunc luo, quia filius meus surrexit contra me, and depulsus sum ab omni honor
meo: Videns ergo Princeps ille regem desolatum miseratione commotus, ait ad
eum. Licet quidem potestate vestra in me abusus fueritis, Deus (...), quia
magna super vos poenitudine movear. Impietas enim maxima adversum vos commissa
est, ab eis maxim apud quos pius et beneficus semper extitistis, Quid ergo
vobis videtur, es^ne vobis inter Principes aliquis relicuts?

Cumque Caesar diceret se ignorare, eo quod nec dum esset tentatum, ille ait,
Potens est Deus adhuc resarcire honorem vestrum, eo quod inique actum sit
adversus vos. Facite ergo, quod suadeo, ascendite urbem hanc, and habete
corporis fessi curam, mittamusque ad regiones and Civitates, tentare si
possimus alicubi invenire auxilium, forsitan enim non ex toto defecit Justitia
a filiis hominum: Nec mora, misit circumquaque pro militibus, collegitque quasi
octingentos loricatos, assumptumque Caesarem, perduxit in Civitatem magnam
Coloniam; Colonienses vero receperunt eum. Quod cum audisset filius, venit cum
exercitu grandi et obsedit Coloniam. Cumque obsidio vehementer incresceret,
Caesar timens Civitati, noctu elapsus fugit Leodium: Et convenerunt illic ad
eum omnes viri constantes, and quorum corda miseratio tetigerat. Perspectoque
auxiliatorum numero, dimicare statuit. Quem cum silius persequeretur in manu
gravi, Ille egressus est in occursum ejus ad aquas Mosanas, Rogavitque
Principes, and omne robur exercitus sui, dicens, Si fortissimus Deus nos hodie
adjuverit in Praelio, factique fuerimus in conflictu superiores, servate mihi
filium meum, and nolite interficere eum. Commissum est ergo Praelium, and
praevalens Pater fugavit filium trans Pontem, multique illic occisi gladio,
plures aquis praefocati sunt. Rursus instauratum est praelium, and Caesar
senior victus, conclusus, comprehensus est. Quantas autem contumelias, quanta
opprobria vir iste magnificus in illis diebus pertulerit, sicut relatu
difficile, ita auditu lamentabile est. Insultabant ei amici, illudebant illi
nihilominus inimici. Denique, ut aiunt, pauperculus quidam, sed literatus,
coram omnibus adorsus est eum, dicens; Inveterate dierum malorum, nunc venerunt
peccata tua quae prius operaberis; judicans judicia injusta, opprimens justum,
and dimittens noxium. In imitation of King David, 2 Samuel 16, 5. to 14.
Cui cum astantes irascerentur viri scilicet sensati; Caesar compescuit eos
dicens, Nolite quaeso, irasci in eum. Ecce filius meus, qui egressus est de
utero meo quaerat animam meam, quanto magis alienus: sinite eum ut maledicat
quia voluntas Dei est. Erat autem illic Episcopus Spirensis Caesari quondam
dilectissimus, nam and templum ingens Dei genetrici apud Spiram construxerat.
Praeterea Civitatem and Episcopum decenter promoverat. Dixit ergo Caesar ad
amicum suum Episcopum de Spira; Ecce destitutus regno, decidi a spe, nihilque
mihi melius est quam renunciare militiae! Da ergo mihi Praebendam apud Spiram,
ut sim famulus Dominae meae Dei genitricis, cui devotus semper exstiti; Novi
enim literas, and possum adhuc subservire choro. Ad quem ille; Per matrem,
inquit Domini, non faciam tibi quod petis. Tunc Caesar suspirans and
illachrymans ad circumstantes ait, In Job 19. 21, 22.
Miseremini mei, miseremini mei vos saltem amici mei, quia manus Domini titegit
me. Mortuus est autem eo tempore Leodii, stetitque corpus ejus inhumatum in
Capella quadam deserta quinque annis. Tanta enim severtitate Dominus Papa, et
caeteri adversarii ejus in ipsum ulti sunt, ut mortuum vel humari non sinerent.

Krantzius, and others add, Ca^aber ejus jam Christianae sepulturae traditum
in monasterio, jubetur extrahi, et in locum poni non consecratum; ubi post
quinque annos reconciliatum, Spiram perducitur. Mirum et incomparabile rerum
humanarum spectaculum et exemplum non vulgar, in quo contemplari possint ima
atque summa. O Magna Dei judicia quae completa sunt in tam praepotenti viro!

quoties enim in praesenti judicamur, a Domino corripimur, ut non cum hoc mundo
damnemur. Fuit autem Ecclesiis admodum bonus, his videlicet quas sibi fideles
persensit. Porro Romanum Antistitem Gregorium and caeteros insidiatores honoris
sui sicut infestos habuit, ita etiam infestare studuit. Impulit eum ad hoc, ut
multi dicunt, gravis necessitas, Quis enim vel minimam honoris sui jacturam
aequanimiter ferat? Legimus autem quia multi peccaverunt, quibus tamen
subventum est poenitentiae remedio. Certe David peccans and poenitens Rex and
Propheta permansit. Rex autem Henricus ad vestigia Apostolorum jacens, orans ac
poenitens gratis, pessundatus est, nec invenit tempore gratiae quod ille
obtinuit duro legis tempore. Sed disputaverint de his qui scierint vel ausi
suerint; Vnum hoc scire licet, Nota.
quia Romana seeds adhuc hodie luit factum illud; a tempore enim illo quotquot
regnant de stirpe illa omnibus modis nituntur humiliare Ecclesias, ne resumant
vires consurgendi adversus Reges, nec infer quae intulerunt patribus eorum.
Regnavit autem Henricus junior pro Patre suo, fuitque Concordia inter Regnum et
Sacerdotium, sed non multo tempore, nam nec ipse prosperatus est in omni vita
sua, irretitus similiter ut Pater ejus a sede Apostolica. De quibus suo loco
dicendum est. A Just punishment of God for his Wars and Rebellions against his
Father to gratify the Pope.

The transcendent Tyranny of this Pope toward this pious Emperor, both in his
life and after his death, (which was Anonymus Historia de vita Hen. 4.
Caesaris: where his Virtues are at large set forth and vindicated against all
his Enemies calumnies.
much lamented by all good men,) made Rodolphus Gualther and Anonymus Historia
de vita Hen. 4. Caesaris: where his Virtues are at large set forth and
vindicated against all his Enemies calumnies.
Balaeus pass this further censure thereon. Et haec quidem non alicujus
barbari tyranni jussu, non Phalaridis alicujus instinctu, sed sanctissimi
Patris consilio si^nt. Gaudete nunc Caligulae, exultate Nerones, and quotquot
unquam crudelitatis nomine fuistis celebres. Habetis enim qui dum vos longo
post se reliquit spatio, infamia and diri nominis memoria liberat; Romanum
videlicet Pontificem, qui in Patris viscera Filii gladium stringi praecepit.

superbissimus Antichristus. But now observe the signal Judgment of God upon
this Treacherous Pope, who instigated this new Emperor most undutifully to
imprison and depose his own Father, whom he kept 5. years from Christian
burial. This Pope, Anno 1106. by another Synod at Guardastal, making Decrees
against Bishops homages to the Emperor and other Princes for their
Temporalties, against receiving Investitures from them, and refusing to
consecrate those Bishops who received Investitures from this Emperor; (the
chief ground of the quarrel against Henry the 4th. his Father) He therewith
exasperated, upon this affront, Platina, St^lla, Balaeus. Barnes in Paschale 2.
imprisons his ghostly Father in Rome it self. Ab eodem Imp. post pedum oscula
capitur, et in Carcerem traditur; nec inde educitur, donec omnes confirmaret,
investiendi jus Carolo magno datum, diplomate restitueret, atque ipsum
Imperatorem confirmaret. Dum in Cathedra (inquit Massaeus) post Missam se
contineret Pontifex, ecce Milites clamantes, Reddite quae sunt Caesaris
Caesari: tam ipsum quam totum Clerum invaserunt, et abduxerunt, exuerunt que
vestibus adeo nudos, ut ne femoralia reliquerint eis, atque ita spoliatos apud
montem Soractim custodiae manciparunt. Videres ergo Cardinales funibus in colla
missis nudos trahi, vinctis post terga manibus. So little did this New Emperor
or his Soldiers value his Papal or his Cardinals authority, holiness, when
put in competition with the ancient Rights of the Imperial Crown, even in this
case of Investitures, for defense where of his Father was so frequently
excommunicated, deprived. I shall recite the story more at large out of
Hermoldus Chron. Slavorum. l. 1. c 60.

others. King Henry the 4. being dead and thus trampled upon by the Pope, and
his Son entangled in Wars in Germany, this Pope thinking he had now obtained a
full conquest in case of Investitures, Synodalibus comitiis non minus dat
operam Pontificiam authoritatem augere, quam Henricus Imperium armis; apud
Trecas enim congregato Concilio contentionem de dandis Episcopatibus
resuscitat, propter quam Hildebrando cum Henrico inimicitiae intercesserunt,
quae fuerunt maximae cladis occasio in Germania. Episcopos namque non ineuntes
secum gratiam and obedientiam pollicentes in eo Concilio dejecit, substituitque
alios: Statuitque neminem ex Laicis debere dare Ecclesiasticas dignitates.
Henricus audiens fale Decretum in Synodo promulgatum, Moguntiae Concilium
habuit, unde misit suos Legatos ad Pontificem, postulaturos ne se ex jure
spoliaret quod olim Carorolo datum esset, et suis omnibus in imperio
successoribus. Pontifex inducias petiit super ea quaestione, donec Henricus
Romam veniret, dicens, Sibi non esse integrum in alieno regno de tantis rebus
aliquid definire. Henricus 5. rebus in Germania pacatis, Anno Dom. 1111. in
Italiam ire decrevit, ingredituriter. In Italiam cum venisset, intellexit
Paschali Pontifici suum adventum esse ingratum, eumque in se gerere hostilem
animum quod pro suo arbitrio Ecclesias and Episcopatus demandasset iis qui sibi
placuissent. Rex ergo Henricus Sutrium subsistit, nec putavit propius accedere
ad Pontificem sibi tutum esse, and missis legatis, tuta fide, ut liceat Romam
adire postulat. Pontifex dat Regi potestatem tuto veniendi Romam, and testatur
se promptum, cum ad consecrationem, tum ad omnem honorem Regium augendum, ea
tamen lege ut Rex Ecclesiae suam libertatem relinquat, in qua tum fuit; and
pollicetur, se pacato agmine ingressurum urbem. His omnibus utrinque per
Legatos compositis, populo Romans annuente, Henricus Roman movet, advenienti
populus and Clerus fit obviam, Sacerdotalibus infulis, et Sanctorum reliquiis
ornati. Leoninam urbem ingreditur, deduciturque in basilicam Petri, in cujus
gradu Paschali Pontifici pedes deosculatur. Henricus positis in statione suis
militibus ad dextram Pontificis, Basilicum ingreditur cum Pontifice; Oratione
autem facta, rogavit, ut Paschalis Episcopos confirmaret a se institutos;
Paschali recusante id facere, totus Dies disceptatione firm absumptus est. Rex
videns, se pace et jure non posse tueri suam potestatem in instituendis
Episcopis, quam quasi per manus omnes Imperatores a Carolo Magno, plusquam per
Trecentos Annos acceperant, Milites a statione (dato signo) vocat, capitque
Pontificem cum Cardinalibus, jubet eos in sua Castra perduci, et custodiri, in
munitissimo monte S. Sylvestri, donec concederent Imperatori suo proprio jure
de instituendis Episcopis libere uti The Romans thereupon fly to their arms,
assault the Emperors Army early in the morning, and after an whole days fight
are vanquished. At last the Pope made Peace, and this agreement with the
Emperor; which was to be ratified by these mutual Oaths, and hoc est

Comes Herimannus, Fredericus Comes Palatinus, Berengarius Comes, Fredericus
Comes, Bonifacius Marcio, Albertus Comes de Bandriaco, Godefridus Comes,

new and unreasonable, dicens, Hermoldus Chron. Sclavorum, l. 1. c. 40.
Imperatorem nemini jurare debet, cum juramentorum Sacramenta ab omnibus sunt
sibi exhibenda: requiring the Pope to ratify all the ancient Rights belonging
to the Emperor; whereupon they came to this second Agreement ratified by the
Popes Charter, and his and the Cardinals Oaths and Subscriptions.

Dominus Papa Paschalis secundus concedet Domino Regi Henrico et Regno ejus, et
privilegio suo sub anathemate confirmabit et corroborabit, Episcopo vel Abbate
libere electo sine Symonia assensu Regis, quod Dom. Rex eum cum anulo et virga
investiat. Episcopus autem vel Abbas a Rege investitus libere accipiat
consecrationem ab Episcopo ad quem pertinuerit. Si quis vero a Clero et populo
eligatur, nisi a Rege investiatur, a nemine consecretur; et Archiepiscopi et
Episcopi libertatem habeant consecrandi a Rege investitos. Super his etiam
Dominus Papa Paschalis non inquietabit Regem Henricum, nec ejus Regnum et
Imperium. (A necessary Clause, since he and his Predecessors had so much
disturbed them during his Fathers reign, and armed him against him.) Hoc
Sacramentum est ex part Papae.

Dominus Papa Paschalis non inquietabit Dominum Regem Henricum, Nota.
nec ejus Imperium vel regnum de investitura Episcopatuum, vel Abbatiarum,
neque de injuria sibi illata et suis, neque aliquod malum reddet sibi vel
alicui personae pro hac causa, et penitus in personam Regis Henrici nunquam
Anathema ponet, nec remanebit in Domino Papa, quin coronet eum sicut in ordine
continetur, et regnum et imperium officii sui auxilio eum tenere adjuvabit pro
posse suo, et hoc adimplebit Dominus Papa sine fraud et malo ingenio. Haec
sunt nomina illorum Episcoporum et Cardinalium qui praecepto Domini Papae
Paschalis secundi Privilegium et Amicitiam Sacramento confirmaverunt Domino
Imperatori Henrico. Petrus Portuensis Episcopus, Centius Sabinensis Episcopus,
Rodbertus Cardinalis Sancti Eusebii, Bonifacius Cardinalis Sancti Marci,

Marcellini and Petri, Vitalis Cardinalis Sanctae Balbinae, Duizo Cardinalis
Sancti Martini, Teobaldus Cardinalis Sancti Johannis and Pauli, Johannes
Diaconus Sanctae Mariae in Schola Graeca.

Istud est Privilegium Domini Papae quod fecit Imperatori de Investituris
Episcopatuum.

Paschalis Episcopus Servus servorum Dei, Charissimo in Christo filio Henrico
Glorioso Teutonicorum Regi, and per Dei operis gratiam Romanorum Imperatori
Augusto, salutem and Apostolicam benedictionem; Regnum vestrum Sanctae Romanae
Ecclesiae singulariter cohaerere dispositio divina constituit. Praedecessores
vestri probitatis cum prudentiae amplioris gratia Romanae Urbis Coronam and
imperium consecuti sunt. Ad cujus videlicet Coronae and Imperii dignitatem,
tuam quoque personam fili Charissime Henrice per Sacerdoti nostri ministerium
Divina Majestas provexit. Illam igitur dignitatis Praerogativam quam
Praedecessores nostri vestris Praedecessoribus Catholicis Imperatoribus
concesserunt, et privilegiorum paginis confirmaverunt, nos quoque dilectioni
tuae concedimus, et praesentis privilegii pagina confirmamus, Vt regni tut
Episcopis vel Abbatibus libere, praeter violentiam et symoniam, electis,
investituram virgae et anuli conferas; post investitutionem vero canonice
consecrationem accipiat ab Episcopo ad quem pertinuerit. Siquis autem a Clero
et populo praeter tuum assensum, electus fuerit, nisi a te investiatur, a
nemine consecretur. Sane Episcopi vel Archiepiscopi libertatem habeant a te
investitos Episcopos vel Abbates Canonice consecrandi. Praedecessores enim
vestri Ecclesias regni sui tantis regalium suorum beneficiis ampliarunt ut
regnum ipsorum Episcoporum maxim vel Abbatum praesidiis oporteat communiri, et
populares dissensiones quae in electionibus saepe contingant, regali oporteat
Majestate compesci. Quamobrem prudentiae et potestativae curae debes
sollicitius imminere ut Romanae Ecclesiae celsitudo, et caeterarum salus
praestante Domino beneficiis et servitiis conservetur. Si qua igitur
Ecclesiastica vel Secularis persona hanc nostrae concessionis paginam temerario
ausu pervertere temptaverit, anathematis vinculo, nisi resipuerit innodetur,
honoris quoque ac dignitatis suae periculum patiatur. Observantes autem
misericordia divina custodiat, et personam potestatemque tuam ad honorem suum,
et gloriam foeliciter, imperare concedat.

His conventionibus and juramentis inter Dominum Papam and Imperatorem in
Paschali festivitate facta est Concordia; Deinde Romam Idus Aprilis Imperator
venit: quem Papa in Ecclesia Sancti Petri missam celebrans, Imperatorem
consecravit, and ei omnibusque suis absolutionem fecit, and omnem injuriam sibi
factam condonavit.

The Emperor being thus solemnly Crowned, and receiving this Charter concerning
Investitures, and Oath from the Pope and Cardinals, not long after departed out
of Italy with his forces, being conducted by the Pope, Cardinals, Prelates,
with all possible professions and expressions of future loyalty and affection
to him. No sooner were the Emperor and his forces departed out of Italy, but
this most perfidious ambitious Pope upon this occasion, summoned a Council at
Rome on purpose to null and abrogate all these his Concessions and Oath to the
Emperor, as made by mere duresse, and constraint, thus related by the Simeon
Dunelmensis. Ab-Uspergensis, and others, here cited, p. 321.

memoriae Papae Vrbani: quae ipsi laudaverunt laudo; quae ipsi tenuerunt teneo;
quae confirmaverunt confirmo; quae damnaverunt damno; quae repulerunt repello;
quae interdixerunt interdico; quae prohibuerunt prohibeo, in omnibus et per
omnia, et in his semper perseverabo. Quibus expletis, Surrexit pro omnibus
Gerardus Engolismensis Episcopus, Legatus in Aquitania, and communi assensu
Domini Papae Pasch. and totius Concilii coram omnibus legi^ hanc Scripturam.
Privilegium illud, quod non est privilegium, sed vere debet pravilegium dici,
pro liberatione Captivorum, et Ecclesiae, a Domino Paschali Papa per violentiam
Regis Henrici extortum, nos omnes in hoc Sancto Concilio cum Domino Papa
congregati, Canonica censura et Ecclesiastica authoritate judicio I much doubt
it.
Sancti Spiritus damnamus, et irritum esse judicamus, atque omnino quassamus,
et ne quid authoritatis et efficacitatis habeat pentius excommunicamus. Et hoc
ideo damnatum est, quia in eo privilegio continetur, quod Electus a Clero et
populo, a nemine consecretur, nisi prius a Rege investiatur, quod est contra
Sanctum Spiritum et Canonicam institutionem. (though tatifyed by this and other
forecited Popes.)

Perlecta vero hac Charta, acclamatum est ab universo Concilio Amen, Amen,
Fiat, Fiat. (O the Punick faith, perjury, treachery of this Pope, his
Cardinals, and Prelates, thus to repeal what they so solemnly ratified by their
Oaths, Charters, in Gods own presence but few Months before to the Emperor,
as his undoubted right!) Archiepiscopi qui cum suis Suffraganeis interfuerunt,
hii sunt, Johannes Patriarcha Veneticus, Senes Capuanus, Laudulfus
Beneventanus, Almaphitanus, Regitanus, Hidrontinus, Brundulfinus, Capsanus,
Girontinus and Graeci, Rosanus, and Archiepiscopus Sanctae Severinae; Episcopi
quoque, Petrus Portuensis, Leo Hostien^s, Cono Praenestinus, Gerardus
Engolisinus, Galo Leonensis, Legatus pro B^turicensi and Viennensi
Archiepiscopis, Rogerus Wulturensis, Gaufridus Senensis, Rollandus Populiensis,
Gregorius Terracinensis, Willielmus Trojanus, Gibinus Siracusanus, Legatus pro
omnibus Siculis, and alii fere C. Episcopi, and Siguinus and Johannes Tusculani
Episcopi cum essent Romae illi die Concilio non interfuerunt, quin postea lecta
damnatione pravilegii, consenserunt, and laudaverunt.

Upon this occasion there arose new Quarrels and contests between the Emperor
and Pope about Investitures; the Bishops, and Churches adhering to the Emperor
asserting, maintaining this his ancient Right against Pope Paschal and his
perjured Confederates Amongst others, Waltramus Bishop of Naumberg writ a
particular Treatise, De Episcoporum Investitura per Imperatores facienda; Which
being very rare and pertinent to my Theme, in respect of the great
controversies about Investitures then arising not only in Germany, but also in
England between Anselm and our Kings, I shall here insert.

Flacii Illyrici Catalog. Testium Veritatis, Appendix. p. 54, 55, 56, 57, 58.
Leo Constantini filius, imperavit annis quinque in regno Graecorum and
Romanorum. Post quem uxor ejus Hyrene, filia Caiani Avarum, id est, Hunnorum
Regis, cum filio suo Constantino imperavit annis december: verum Constantinus
matrem suam Hyrenen imperio privavit, solusque annis sex imperavit. Hyrene
autem super erepto sibi imperio, foemineo dolor abusa, Constatinum filium suum
oculis and imperio privavit, and sola annis sex imperavit. Not Pope Leo.
Romani autem, qui ab Imperatore Constantinopolitano jam animo desciverant,
propter tardum and infructuosum illius auxilium contra Tyrannos, accepta
occasionis opportunitate, quia mulier, excaecato Imperatore Constantino filio
suo, imperabat, uno omnium consensu Carolo Magno Imperatoris lauds
acclamaverunt, eumque per manus Leonis Papae coronaverunt, Caesarem and
Augustum appellantes. Igitur ex quo Byzantium Thraciae Civitas, a primo
Constantino in novam amplificata, and in regiam urbem est exaltata, evolutis
annis circiter CCCCLXVIII, diviso a Constantinopoli Romano imperio, Carolus
Magnus Rex Francorum primus imperavit Romany annos XIII. Ex tunc a Graecis in
Reges ^rancorum translata est Imperatoria dignitas: and Adrianus Papa,
collaudantibus Romany and plena Synodo Primatum, Archiepiscoporum,
Episcoporum, Abbatum, Ducum and Principum acclamatione; Carolo Magno, ejusque
successoribus futuris Imp. sub anathemate concessit Patriciatum Romanum: and
per se vel per nuncios confirmationem in electione, et in consecratione Romani
Pontif concessit, et investituras Episcoporum eis determinavit, ut non
consecretur Episcopus qui per Regem et Imp non introiret pure et integre:
exceptis quos Papa Romanus investire et consecrare debet ex antiquo dono Regum
et Imperat. cum aliis quae vocantur Regalia, id est a Regibus et Imperatoribus
Pontif. Romany data, in fundis; et redditibus. In hac concessione continentur
regales Abbatiae, Praepositurae. Ex hoc constituto, Carolus Magnus, Aistulfum,
Desiderium, aliosque Reges and tyrannos, bello, caede and exilio delevit, qui
fundos and bona Ecclesiae Romanae, aliarumque Ecclesiarum invaserant, omnia
reddens libertari. Alii Reges et Imperatores, successores Caroli Magni,
defensionem Romanae Ecclesiae, et aliarum Ecclesiarum timore Dei et charitate
devote prosequuti sunt, investituras Episcoporum facientes, eorum
consecrationibus per se and nuncios suos as^istentes, juxta quod Paulus
Apostolus ait ad 1 Cor. 15, ^6.
Corinthios: Non quod primum spirituale, sed quod animale, diende spirituale.
Magnus etiam Gregorius, Theodorico and Theodeberto, and Brummihildi scribit, ut
absque Symonia investituras Episcoporum faciant. Hic etiam primus Gregorius non
est consecratus, donec Mauritii Imperatoris interfuit assensus. Ioannes Papa
investituram Leodicensis Episcopatus, quam Carolus Rex fecerat, Richario
Prumiensi Abbati plane confirmat, et invasionem Hilduvini per Gisilbertum
Comitem de Capremonte sub anathemate damnat. Papa Leo primo Otthoni, aliique
plures Pontifices Romani idem confirmaverunt sub anathemate Regibus et
Imperatoribus. Vnde mirum est, imo periculosum in salutem animarum, quod ea
quae sancti antecessores ex magna necessitate, et patenti ratione sub
anathemate confirmaverunt, atempore Gregorii, qui et Hilteprandus, sub
absolutione immutantur. Qui a primo Constantino, quem Silvester baptizavit,
gesta et decreta revolverit, patenter inveniet, quod per Reges et Imperatores,
et devotos Laicos, Romana Ecclesia, aliaeque in orb terrarum Ecclesiae, in
fundis et mobilibus ditatae et exaltatae sunt, sibique tutelas et defensiones
contra tyrannos et raptores retinuerunt, ut gladius Regalis et stola Petri sibi
invicem subveniant, quasi duo Cherubin conversis vultibus, respicientia in
Propitiatorium. Romani Pontifices, aliique prasules, de sundis and rebus per
devotos Laicos et Laicas adquisitis, and a seculari potestate confirmatis,
struxerunt and ornaverunt Ecclesias: et a quibus acceperunt gratiam, non debent
infer contumeliam, et si de investituris peccaverunt, exemplo primi Gregoria.
Georgu exhibeantur. Quod Paulus dicit: 2 Timothy 4. ^.
Argue, ob^ecra, increpa, in omni patientia and doctrina. Hieronymas in
Epistolis suis dicit, Quadringentos Epi copo^ Imperiales literae ad Synodum
contraxerunt. In hoc virtus Imperialis egit, quod excommunicatio Pontificis
agere non potuit, ut sine captione, sine damnatione, sine contumelia, tot
Episcopi ierunt and redierunt. Nota.
Excommunicatio enim quanto inteligetur and timetur, tanto cavendo vitatur: and
punitio corporalis in vita, vel in membris, and rebus vel in sundis, plures
resipiscere facit ex justicia regali. Domino autem Pontifici summopere cavendum
est ex medulla Scripturarum, ne quando liget in terris, quae Deus solvent in
coelis: and quando solvit in terris, Deus liget in coelis. Hoc evenit ex illa
gloria praelationis, nimiisque motibus animorum, quando succedentes Pontifices
praecedentium Pontificum decreta and excommunicationes immutant and solvunt.
Unde cum Dominus Jesus, ipsa veritas, dicat: John 28. 29.
Si male loquutus su^n, testimonium perhibe de malo: mirum est, and periculosum
in Christi pusillos, quod antiqua constituta sub anathemate confirmata, novis
immutationibus solvunt, and inde nolunt reprehendi, objicientes, Romana judicia
non sunt retractanda. Si Romana judicia non sunt retractanda, non videtur
pusillis Christi canonicum and salubre, ut a tempore Gregorii (qui and
Hildeprandus) ea solvantur, quae sub anathemate consirmaverunt (...), Leo,
Adrianus, primus Gregorius, Leo, Benedictus, erga Reges et Imperatores, de
investiendis Episcopis per illos: a quibus, et etiam a devotis Laicis and
foeminis, fundi and alia mobilia, Ecclesiis omni in orb terrarum provenerunt,
sibique tutelas et defensiones rerum Ecclesiasticarum retinuerunt contra
tyrannos et raptores. Si in successione quisque solvit, quod praedecessio sub
anathemate confirmavit: ecce oritur confusio pusillis Christi, cui parti potius
assentiendum sit, antiquae an novae. Pars antiqua in paupertate mediocri and
honesta arguit, obsecravit in patientia and doctrina, and parcendo justitiae
majores and inferiores personas ad correctionem adduxit. Nova autem pars ex
votis fidelium insolescens, sub specie religionis omnia trahit ad se manibus
expansis, cum Dominus dicat, Mat. 22. 2^.
Reddite Caesari, quae sunt Caesaris, and Deo quae sunt Dei; Gregorius,
Augustinus, Ambrosius testantur, ea quae sunt data Ecclesiis a Seculari
potestate, et confirmata, potius a seculari potestate retinenda. Legitur etiam
de Episcopis Hispaniae, Nota
Scotiae, Angliae, Vngariae, quomodo ex antiqua institutione, usque ad modernam
novitatem, per Reges introirent cum pace temporalium pure et integre. Qui
pacifice sollicitus est, revolvat vitas patrum, and historias legate, and
intelligat. Sed Episcopatus qui sub Romano degunt imperio, majoribus fundis,
and amplioribus vigent justiciis; and ideo propter majus scandalum, a stola
Petri discretius tractandi sunt, quia non omnes sunt Petrus, qui tenent sedem
Petri. Sic Mat. 23. 2.
Scribae and Pharisaei, qui sederunt super cathedram Moysi, non omnes fuerunt
Moses. Elatio enim ex praelatione, et indiscretio ex correctione, pariunt
scandalum in confusionem: and fit manifest illud, quod Dominus in Evangelio
dicit: Mat. 23. 15.
Vos Scribae and Pharisaei circuitis mare and aridam, ut faciatis unum
proselytum; and cum inveniretis, facitis filium Gehennae, duplo quam vos. Long
etiam ante decretum Adriani Papae, ejusque successorum, Reges qui non erant
uncti, et Majores domus, investituras Episcoporum fecerunt: scilicet
Dagobertus, Sigibertus, Theodoricus, Hilaricus, Pipinus filius Beggae Major
Domus, Theodebertus. Ab his inthronizati sunt Remaclus. Amandus, Audomarus,
Autpertus, Eligius, Lampertus, alisque sanctissim praesules; cum Reges isti in
moribus suis satis fuerint notabiles, et solo nomine Regum per majores domus
vivebant. Postquam autem Romani, ingruentibus vicinis and gravibus bellis,
desciverunt a Graecis Imperatoribus, ex causis supradictis, Papa Stephanus ob
infestinationem Longobardorum venit Parisios, and assensu Romanorum and
Francorum in Regem and Imperatorem unxit Pipinum, filium Caroli Martelli, nati
ex Alpaide: proter quam ex pellicatu increpatam, Pontifex Lampertus martyr
factus est. Unxit etiam idem Pontifex Stephanus filios ejusdem Pipini, Carolum
qui agnominatus est Magnus, and Carolomannum frarrem ejus, confirmans stirpem
illorum in Regia and in Imperatoria dignitate. Ibi de Investiendis Episcopis
per Reges, antiquam consuetudinem confirmavit: Ex horum collectione pure et
integre servanda est antiqua constitutio, ne pusilli Christi scandalizentur.
Nil enim refert, sive verbo, sive praecepto, sieve baculo, sive alia re quam in
manu tenuerit, investiat aut inthronizet Rex et Imperator Episcopum: qui die
consecrationis veniens, annulum et baculum ponit super altar, et in curam
pastoralem Signa.
singula suscipit a stola et ab aucthoritate sancti Petri. Sed congruum magis
est, per baculum, qui est duplex, id est temporalis et spiritualis. Operatius
enim in seminandis spiritualibus dignus est mercede sua, In 1 Cor. 9. 11.
non accipiendis temporalibus, juxta quod Paulus ait: In 1 Cor. 9. 11.
Si spiritualia vobis seminamus, non est magnum si carnalia, id est temporalia
a vobis metamus. Praecedens investitura per Regem in fundis et rebus Ecclesiae
contra tyrannos et raptores, quieta et pacifica reddit omnia. Sequitur autem
Consecratio, ut bannus Episcopalis banno Regali conveniens, in communem salutem
operetur: et si Episcopis faciendum est regibus hominium, et sacramentum de
regalibus, apertius est ante consecrationem, cum Paulus Apostolus dicat: Romans
14. 5.
Vnusquisque in suo sensu abundet. Omnia divina and Ecclesiastica per magistros
Ecclesiarum ad pacem and quietem pusillorum Christi tendere debent. Legitur
etiam in libris Regum et Machabaeorum, quod a regibus Iudaeis et gentilibus
sacerdotes investituras acceperunt, etiam in Iudaismo. A Petro usque ad
Silvestrum, qui Constantinum baptizavit, Imperatores Romani erant Gentiles, and
Christianorum persecutores: and in fundis and rebus Ecclesiasticis pauperes
erant Ecclesiae: and a timoratis Christianis, qui tunc pauci erant, Romae and
alibi constituebantur Episcopi. Postquam autem a Silvestro per Christianos
Reges and Imperatores dotatae, ditatae and exaltatae sunt Ecclesiae in fundis,
and aliismobilibus: and Imperatores tatum ^nteloneis, monetis, villicis and
scabinis, comitatibus, advocatiis, Synodalibus bannis per Reges delegata sunt
Episcopis: congruum fuit et consequens, ut Rex qui est unus in populo, et caput
populi, investiat, et inthronizet episcopum, et contra irruptionem hostium
sciat cui civitatem suam credat, cum jus suum in donum illorum transtulerit.
Primus Gregorius conqueritur dolendo, de quodam Episcopo, qui adeo pauper erat,
ut de Episcopatu suo contra frigus hyemalem vestem habere non posset. A taali
Episcopo, forsitan sancto, non erat Regi necessarium exigere hominium,
sacramentum, obsides. Ex hoc, prout sunt consuetudines in regnis per orbem
terrarum, de Episcopis investiendis servanda sunt antiqua jura. Sicut enim
primus Gregorius dicit: Si voluissem, inquit, hodie Gens Longobardorum nec
Regem nec Duces haberet: and quia Dominum timui, in alicujus sanguinem me
miscere nolui. Ita successores ipsius Gregorii cavere debent scandalum, ne
contristent noviter Reges in suis antiquis juribus, per quorum antecessores
caput et membra exaltata et confirmata sunt: sed juxta Paulum a Pontifice
Romano et Regibus omnia fiant in charitate et humilitate, remotis superbia et
contentione. Quapropter apud Pontifices and Reges fiant Ecclesiastica pure et
integre, quia Dominus JESUS dicit: Mat. 6. 22, 2^.
Si oculus tuus fuerit simplex, totum corpus tuum lucerna erit: id est, si
intentio bona est, et opus bonum est. Si Romani Pontifices intendunt Regibus
auferre antiqua jura de investiendis Episcopis, timent, dubitant, dolent
pusilli Christi. Reges si in Episcoporum investituris excesserint, possunt a
timoratis viris et Pontifice Romano argui, et ad rectam correctionis lineam
reduci. Si autem in promotione et consecratione Episcoporum Pontifex Romanus
exorbitaverit, et sub verbo summae praelationis ad voluntatem suam egerit, non
vult ut reprehendatur, cum Dominus Jesus se reprehendi concesserit, dicens,
Johan. 18. 23.
Si male locutus sum, testimonimonium perhibe de malo. Isti autem, Summus (in
quiunt) Pontifex anemine judicetur. Et si ab illa sua aucthoritate sub specie
religionis introducuntur personae contra oculos Dei, ecce periculum et in
capite et in membris: id est, qui scienter operantur, et scienter cooperantur.
Unde Dominus JESUS hypocrisin, et avaritiam, and cupiditatem sacerdotum in
Evangeliis super omnia arguit, vocans illos sepulchra dealbata: et peccatum
mulieris adulterae misericorditer suscipit: and tria genera eunuchorum humane
definit, Mat. 13. 27. Mat. 17. 24, 25. 26. c. 22. 17, 18

Petrus, Paulus, aliique in orb terrarum viri sanctissimi concedunt in
sententiam Domini JESU, qui omnibus dixit, Mat. 5. 9.
Beati pacifici, quoniam regnum Dei possidebunt. Sunt autem Pacifici, qui ex
contentione, arrogantia, cupiditate, ex nimiis motibus animorum, non moventur,
non inveniunt commutationes contra antiqua jura propter pacem constituta,
maxim propter potestates superiores, in quorum pace 1 Timothy 2. 2, 3.
juxta Paulum) tranquillam vitam agere debemus. Notandum est autem,
Pontificibus Romany et little civibus, quando orta fuerat divisio in electione
Pontificum, et in communione civium, non est par restituta nisi per Graecos
Imperatores, quandiu Imperium ibi fuit: et per Francos Imp. ex quo Imperium
Romanorum datum est eis. Et quidam Graeci Imperatores Christiani, quosdam
Romanos Pontifices viros sanctissimos, usque ad exilium and mortem
immisericorditer tractaverunt: sicut legitur de Agapeto, and de Joanne:
Imperatores autem ex Francis, honest and pie deduxerunt, sicut legitur de
Stephano, et de Leone excaecato. De divisione cleri et populi in electione
Romani Pontificis, comprehensa per Honorium Augustum, ex Graecis ita legitur:
Bonifacius xl. Romanae praesedit Ecclesiae. Contra hunc Bonifacium ordinato
Eulalio, et per hoc dissidente Ecclesia, ambo jussu Honorii Augusti, urbe
egrediuntur, et sic reprobato Eulalio, jussu Augusti, Bonifacius, quia prior
ordinatus fuerat, sedi Apostolicae restituitur. De divisione Romanorum civium
in electione Pontificum per Imperatores ex Francis adnihilata, ita legitur:
Otto primus Ioannem, quem Adalbertus Papam constituerat, iudicio Canonico
deponi fecit, et Leonem ordinari fecit; et iste Ioannes se cum uxore cujusdam
oblectans, a diabolo percussus est, ac sine viatico mortuus. Post reditum
Ottonis, Romani ex ambitione quendam Benedictum superposuerunt. Imperator
rediens, obsessa Roma, Romanos caede et fame adeo afflixit, ut Leonem Papam se
recepturos promitterent, et jurarent: Benedictus rejectus non solum Papatu, sed
etiam sacerdotio, a Leone exordinatur. Idem Benedictus Simoniace Papatu Romano
invaso, cum esset rudis literarum, alterum ad vices Ecclesiastici officii
exequendas, secum Papam consecrari fecit. Quod cum multis non placeret, tertius
superducitur, qui vices duorum expleret Romae. Vno itaque contra duos, and
duobus contra unum de Papatu altercantibus, Rex Henricus filius Chonradi,
contra eos Romam vadit: et eis Canonica et Imperiali censura depositis,
Swyggerus Babenbergensis Episcopus, qui et Clemens, Romanae Ecclesiae Cxlvi
praesedit: et ab eo Rex Henricus ad Imperatorem benedictus est, jurantibus
Romany, se sine ejus consensu, ejusque successorum, nunquam Papam electuros.
Igitur haec scandala gravia pastores animarum cavere debent, coram Deo, in vera
simplicitate, propter pusillos. Ex quo Imperium Romanorum Carolo Magno
acclamatum est, sunt anni trecenti et unum, est autem annus praesens,
Millesimus centesimus nonus, quando ultimum Pascha fuit ab incarnatione Domini,
secundum Cyclum Dionysii.

Pontificatum Romanum obtinuerat sub Gregorii septimi nomine: nullo tamen Romani
Imperatoris, qui tunc Henrichus quartus erat, conseju accedente. Quod quidem ut
contra ritus sacrosanctae Catholicae Ecclesiae esset, atque juribus
authoritatique Imperii multum derogare videretur, sic Reip. maximam calamitatem
peperit. Statim enim quibusdam Symoniacae haeresis quaesitis calumniis,
Principibus Romany potestatem conferendi Ecclesiastica officia eripere
tentabat: quam Imperatores ab eo tempore quo in Germania Christus praedicari
coeperat, habuerant integram. Papa autem causae caput ab ipso Imperatore
inchoans, omnia miscebat: cum bellis occupatus Augustus, initiis obstare non
posset: atque Conciliis, quae Papa hinc indicebat, consulto interesse nollet.
Hinc in ipsum insidiae siruebantur, adeo ut and de vita periclitaretur. Quibus
non succedentibus, aperta vi grassabatur in Imperatorem ambitiosus Pontifex, ac
summissis inauguratisque demum tyrannis supplicem sibi reddit. Tandem devictis
tyrannis, and Hildeprandum ipsum solio dejicit Augustus, cujus tamen victoria
tanta non fuit, quo minus Victor and Urbanus, insequentes duo Pontifices eo
etiam invito Romanam sedem ascenderent: Clemente, quem ipse ad eandem
dignitatem intulisset, excluso. A Paschali deinde exagitatus Imperator, atque
ab Henrico V. filio, quem Pontifex instigaverat, and imperio et vita spoliatus,
dum Pontifex odio adhuc flagrans, investiendi Episcoporum jus imperatoribus
nititur extorquere: quapropter variae de hac re hinc inde habentur
consultationes, diversis in locis congregantur Concilia, doctorumque virorum
ingenia seriis disputationibus exercentur; inter quos Waltramus hic,
Namburgensis Episcopus, hunc quem damus Libellum exaravit. Pontifex autem
ambitiosissimus, qui authoritatem suam omnibus modis amplificare studebat,
nullius acquiescens consiliis, captus tandem, and vix liberatus, Henricho
privilegia Francorum Imperatorum confirmavit: cujus confirmationis exempla apud
Marianum Scotum, Nauclerum, atque aliis permultis in historiis extant. Statim
vero post discessum Imperatoris, Pontifex retractavit quod concesserat,
Pravilegium nominans, quod scripto ediderat: quanquam morte praeventus, quod
moliretur excqui, atque ipsius successor Gelasius dignitatem, quam inconsulto
Imperatore invaserat, retinere non posset. Atqui Calixtus, qui ex Burgundiaca
familia Papa effectus, minis, dirisque abstentionibus, invisum omnibus
Imperatorem reddidit: and ita terruit, ac nescio quo consanguinitatis vinculo
enervavit, ut maximo, ac adhuc nunquam deleto Germaniae Imperii totius
dedecore, jus investiendi Pontificis condonaret; i^que apud Wormaciam ad Rhenum
in campo quodam spaciocisissimo proclamare juberet. Literis insuper conscriptis
and obsignatis, quas Pontificii postea Romae in victoriae signum, et
triumphatae Germaniae testimonium public in aede Apostoli Petri suspenderunt.

Sed Romanus Papa Caesar, atque ejus Socii Episcopi, factis clamoribus

at Mentz, and to perfect his consecration to that See, without requiring the
Emperors consent thereto, placing all his confidence in the most potent
Imperial Pope, quem videbat coelum terrae impune miscere posse, longeque plus
valere Papae fulmen, quam Caesaris gladium; qui Spirae cum paucis Principibus
and Episcopis sese continet, acerbe ferens and observans quae Coloniae
agebantur. The Popes Legate suddenly deceasing before the Excommunication
published, the Emperor thereupon sent the Bishop of Wirteburg to Colen to treat
with these insolent Prelates, who would not admit nor hear him, till he had
reconciled himself to them, and promised to approve the sentence of the Synod;
who thereupon retiring to the Emperor without effecting any thing, was
compelled to say Mass before him; ea peracta mox ad hosts Henrici omnino
iterum defecit; Such was the treachery of those Popish German Prelates to this
Emperor who advanced them: Tam superbe itaque repulsus Uspergensis Chronicon,

Imperator et excommunicatus in Italiam, furoribus Ecclesiasticorum et
Principum cessurus cum regina totaque familia sese confert, cum Papa Caesare,
si qua ratione posset, reconciliationem tractaturus: Where staying an whole
year, he employed the Abbot of Clungy to mediate a reconciliation between him
and the Pope; Sed superbus and durus Paschalis difficillimum sese praebet,
tandemque Synodum Romae instituit. Wherein the Pope declaring the principal
cause of calling this Synod, confessed he had done ill in granting the
privilege of Investitures to the Emperor, desiring their prayers to God to
pardon this his transgression: superadding, Illud malum scriptum, quod in
tentoriis factum est, quod pro pravitate sua Pravilegium dicitur, condemno sub
perpetuo anathemate, ut nullius sit unquam bonae memoriae, et rogo vos omnes ut
idem faciatis. Tunc ab universis acclamatum est (as in the former Synod) Fiat,
Fiat. Bruno autem Siguinus Episcopus, altius exorsus est, gratias agens
Omnipotenti Deo, quod Dominum Paschalem Papam, qui praesenti Concilio
praesidet, audivimus proprio ore condemnantem illud privilegium, quod
pravitatem et haeresin continebat. Ad haec quidam ex ast antibus Episcopis
subjunxit; Si privilegium illud haeresin continebat, Ergo qui illud scripsit
hae reticus fuit. Johannes autem Cajetanus ad haec commotus, Siguino respondit:
Tu ne hic, and in Concilio, nobis audientibus Romanum Pontificem appelles
haereticum? Scriptum quod fecit Dominus Papa, malum quidem fuit, sed haeresis
non fuit. Et alter quidam adjecit, Imo nec malum dici debet, quia si liberare
populum Dei bonum est, quod Dominus Papa fecit, bonum fuit: Sed liberare
populum Dei bonum est, authoritate Evangelii, quia praecipimus, 1 John 3. 16.
animas quoque pro fratribus ponere. The Popes patience being awakened, and
moved with this charge of Heresy, commanding silence with his hand, said;
Fratres and Domini mei audite; Ecclesia haec nunquam habet haeresin, imo hic
omnes haereses conquassatae sunt, etc. On the 6. day of the Council, when as
Cuno Praenestinus Episcopus frequently attempted to Excommunicate the Emperor
therein, Johannes Cajetanus, and Petrus Leo, with some other of the Emperors
friends resisted him to his face, and restrained him with these words: Ecclesia
primitiva martyrum tempore floruit apud Deum, and non apud homines; Deinde ad
fidem conversi sunt Reges, Imperatores, Romani Principes, qui matrem suam
Ecclesiam sicut boni filii honest averunt, conferendo Ecclesiae Dei praedia,
and allodia, seculares honores and dignitates, regalia quoque jura and
insignia, quemadmodum Constantinus caeterique fideles; and cepit Ecclesia
florere tam apud homines, quam apud Deum. Habeat ergo matter and Domina nostra
Ecclesia sibi a Regibus sive Principibus collata, dispenset and tribuat ea
filiis suis, and sicut scit, and sicut vult. Notwithstanding which opposition,
Paschalis privilegium Investiturae, quod in tentoriis concessisse videbatur,
obliterare volens, iterans sententiam Papae Gregorii Septimi, investituram
Ecclesiasticarum rerum a Laica manu rursus excommunicavit sub anathemate dantis
and accipientis; Hereupon Cardinalis vero Dominus Cuno Praenestinus, talem
Papae fecit inductionem Legationis suae, and contra disturbatores praesentis
negotii competentem; Domine Pater, si tuae placet Majestati, si vere tuus fui
Legatus, and quae feci tibi placent esse rata, in auribus Sancti hujus
praesentis Concilii ore tuo edicito, and Legationem meam tua Authoritate
corrobora, ut sciant omnes, quia tu me misisti. Ad haec Apostolicus respondens,
ait; Vere Legatus ex latere nostro missusfuisti, and quicquid tu caeterique
fratres nostri, Cardinales, Episcopi, Legati Dei and Apostolorum Petri and
Pauli hujus sedis, and nostra Authoritate fecerunt, confirmaverunt,
probaverunt, ego quoque probo and confirmo, quicquid damnaverunt damno. Et
Dominus Praenestinus consequenter subjunxit, qualiter pro sedis illius
Legatione Hierosolymis audierit, Regem Heinricum post Sacramenta, obsides and
oscula, in ipsa beati Petri Ecclesia Dominum Papam tenuisse captum, indigne
tractatum, potiora Ecclesiae membra, Cardinales videlicet, exutos, tractos, et
male tractatos, Nobiles quoque Romanos occisos et captivos, et populorum
stragem factam, audiens, ingemuerit, et pro hujusmodi facinoribus Ecclesiae
Hierosolymitanae consilio et zelo Dei animatus, excommunicationis sententiam in
Regem dictarit, et eandem in Graecia, Vngaria, Saxonia, Lotharingia, Francia,
in quinque Conciliis, consilio praedictarum Ecclesiarum, renovando confirmarit.
Orare se demum, ut sicut Dominus Papa Legationem suam confirmasset, ita
praesentes Concilii Patres and Episcopi concorditer annuerent. Ad eundem modum
Legati, and literae Domini Viennensis postulabant. Dum tali ratione et ordine,
tam variae and dissonae multitudinis assensus exquiritur, a saniori part
veritati and apertae rationi nihil contradictum, a paucis submurmuratum, ab
Episcopis vel Abbatibus nullo modo reclamatum.

The Emperors Excommunications being thus ratified by the Pope and Council, the
sad consequences thereof are thus recorded by Chronicon. Anno 1116, 1117,

conditionis and aetatis, praeter solos Ecclesiasticae professionis homines,
quibus jam pene nihil praeter miseram restabat vitam, caeteri hoc tempore
belluino furore bacchantur.

The Emperor thus still vexed, excommunicated by this Luciferian Pope and his
Prelates, without any hopes of reconciliation by all his amicable Treaties,
being tired out with Papal delays, and exasperated by new affronts, resolved
to recover his right, and work out his peace by force of arms. Aventinus,
Balaeus, and others forecited.
In pursuit whereof, Heinricus tantam inclementiam Papae aegerrime ferens,
exercitu conscripto, ipsemet Romam contendit, armis discreturus quod summa
subjectione, and quotidianis precibus obtinere non poterat. Sed Papa id
animadvertens, sese in pedes conjecit, atque in Apuliam fugiens, ibi Rogerium
contra Imperatorem impellit. Dum itaque Romae Imperator est, in Apulia denuo
suos convocat, quieti non assuefactus Paschalis; and primum quidem fulminibus
suis Acheronta movet, deinde Rogerium hastis atque gladiis cruentis in
Heinricum armat; who thought to surprise the Emperor at unawares; but being
prevented by the Emperors sudden collecting of his forces, resolving to give
him battle, he retreated with the Pope into Apulia. The Emperor often
petitioned the Pope to absolve him from his Excommunications, but he still
affirmed he could not do it without the consent of the Bishops who concurred
with him in the sentence, and that in a Synod, where both parties might be
heard, the Bishops by their Letters urging him to continue it. During these
delays, the Emperor retyring with his forces from Rome into Germany, to
suppress the Insurrections there raised against him by the Archbishop of Mentz
and other Prelates and Confederates of the Pope; Paschal thereupon returned to
Rome, and repossessed himself of St. Peter's Church; whither the Emperor
marching with a great Army to chastise him, Paschal soon after breathed forth
his seditious Antichristian spirit.

During these contests between the Emperor and Paschal concerning Investitures,
Yvo Carnotensis Epistola 196, 238, 239. Morney Historia Papatus, p. 286, 287.
Richardus de Vassemburg in Chronico.
there fell out this Quarrel between the King of France and him. About the year
1108. Pope Paschal presiding in the Synod of Treca in France, therein published
some Decrees against the Kings ancient rights of Investitures, and Bishops
Oaths, Homages, Fealty to him. In pursuance whereof, he presumed to make
Richard Archdeacon of Virodune, Archbishop of Rhemes, to withdraw him from the
Emperors party, and confirm his usurped Papal authority in France: which
preferment Richard refusing, being made Bishop of Verdune by the Emperor,
Paschal thereupon constitured Rudolphus Archbishop of Rhemes, by his own Papal
authority, without the consent of King Lewis the Gross, then newly come to the
Crown, and involved in wars with his Barons: who thereupon taking possession of
the Archbishopric, King Jews on the contrary, created Gervasius Archbishop,
Et Archiepiscopatu Rhemensi pro suo jure investit: The City hereupon receiving
Gervasius for their Archbishop, was interdicted and excommunicated by Paschal,
who employed Yvo Carnotensis, to mediate with King Jews, to remove Gervasius
as an intruder, receive Rudolphus into his royal favor, and grant him leave to
enjoy the Archbishopric. The King at last, upon Yvo his solicitation,
concessit ut eum ad Curiam suam, quae Aurelianis in Natali Domini congreganda
erat, Rudolphum secure adduceremus, and ibi cum eo and Principibus regni de hoc
negotio, quantum fieri posset, salva Regni integritate, tractaremus. But what
the issue of this Treaty was, Yvo himself thus relates in his Epistle to Pope
Paschal. Sed reclamante Curia, plenariam pacem impetrare nequivimus, nisi
praedictus Metropolitanus per manus et Sacramentum eam fidelitatem Regi
faceret, quam praedecessoribus suis Regibus Francorum antea fecerant omnes
Rhemorum Archiepiscopi, et caeteri Regni Francorum, quamlibet Religiosi et
sancti Episcopi: Whereupon Yvo made this request to Paschal; Petimus ergo
flexis genubus, ut hoc eodem intuitu charitatis and pacis veniale habeat
paterna moderatio, quod illicitum facit non aeterna lex (Dei) sed intention
acquirendae libertatis praesidentium (Pontificum) sola Prohibitio. So that this
great Bishop and Canonist Yvo, deemed Kings investing of Bishops, and Bishops
Oaths, Fealty made to Princes, constantly practiced ever before and at that
time by all the holy and religious Archbishops and Bishops of France, no ways
unlawful by Gods Law, but by Popes mere prohibitions: Which he likewise Yvo
Carnotensis Epist. 238, 239
asserted against John Bishop of Lions, and Hugo the Popes Legate in France,
who expostulating, that this King had invested the Archbp. of Sienna against
the Popes Decretals; Ivo declared it to be no Heresy nor crime (as Popes
deemed it) cum hoc nullam vim Sacramenti in constituendo Episcopo, vel
admissum, vel omissum, quod fidei and religioni officiat, habeat, cum Reges
nihil spirituale se dare intendant, sed tantum votis petentium annuere, and
bona exteriora, quae de munificentia Regum obtinent Eccl^siae, ipsis electis
conceder, etc. Whereupon he made this supplication and gave this good advise to
Pope Paschal, (who attempted, Hermanensem Episcopatum a Noviodunensi
distrahere, without the Kings royal assent:) Epistola 238.
Nos sicut filii and fideles, rogamus and consul^^^s, ut statum Ecclesiarum
Galliae, quae quadringentis ferme annis duravit, inconcu^^um manner concedatis;
ne hac occasion Schisma, quod est in Germa^eo Regiis adversus sedem
Apostolicam, in Galliarum regno susciter^s. (...) enim Paternitas vestra, quod
cum Regnum and Sacerdotium inter (...) convenient, been regitur mundus, floret
and fructificat Ecclesia: Cum vero inter se discordant, non tantum parvae res
non crescunt, sed etiam maximae res miserabiliter dilabuntur; whereupon this
Pope made no further progress in these Usurpations.

This Epist. 62. and 171. Decretalium, pars 16. c. 344.
Yvo Carnotensis asserts the Supremacy of Kings as well in Ecclesiasticals as
Temporals; That they ought not to be excommunicated; That if they receive any
Excommunicate persons into their royal favor and protection, the Bishops,
Priests and people ought to absolve and receive them into their Communion;
Dispositiones rerum temporalium Regibus attributa sunt, and Basilei, id est,
fundamentum populi et caput existunt; Si aliquando potestate sibi concessa
abutuntur, non sunt a Nobis graviter exasperandi, sed ubi Sacerdotum
admonitionibus non acquieverint, divino judicio sunt reservandi, (not to the
Popes tribunal) ubi tanto districtius sunt puniendi, quanto minus fuerint
divinis admonitionibus obnoxii; unde habetur in libro Capitularia Ca^oli Magni

Capitulorum Regalium auctoritate Episcoporum constitutorum. Si quos culpatorum
Regia potestas aut in gratiam benignitatis receperit, aut mensae suae
participes effecerit, his etiam Sacerdotum et populorum conventus suscipere in
Ecclesiastica communione debebit, ut quod principalis pietas recipit, nec a
Sacerdotibus Dei alienum habeatur. Upon which account Yvo thus justified his
reception of Gervasius, an Excommunicated person, ad communionem in Paschali
Curia: Pro regia honorificentia hoc feci, fretus auctoritate Legis praedictae,
which he there recites; thus ratified and prefaced in his Decretals, and in the
12. Council of Toledo. Vidimus quosdam and flevimus ex numero culpatorum
receptos in gratiam Principum, extorres extitisse a Collegio Sacerdotum; quod
notabile malum illa res agit, quia Licentia principalis, in qua se solvi
licentius curat, ibi alios alligat, and quos in suam communionem videtur
suscipere, a communione and pace Ecclesiae eligit separare, and qui cum illa
convescant, sola Sacerdotum communione priventur. Et ideo quia remissio talium
qui contra Regem, gentem vel patriam agunt, per definitiones Canonum antiquorum
in potestate solum regia ponitur, cui et peccasse noscuntur, ideo.
adeo nulla se deinceps a talibus abstinebit Sacerdotum communio; Sed quos
regia potestas aut in gratiam benignitatis receperit, aut participes mensae
suae effecerit, hos etiam sacerdotum ac populorum conventus suscipere in
Ecclesiasticam communionem debebit; ut quod Principalis pietas habet acceptum,
neque a Sacerdotibus Dei habeatur extraneum. This was the received practice
both of the Churches, Realms of France, Spain, and of England too, (as the
learned French Advocate Pierre Pithou proves at large, by several Histories,
Presidents, Authorities;) before and under Pope Gregory, Urban, and Paschal the
2. whose excommunications of the Emperors Henry 3. and 4. and their adherents,
by all these resolutions, were merely uncanonical, and void, by this approved
ancient Law, which gave Emperors and Kings power to absolve their
Excommunicated Subjects, and exempted themselves much more from
Excommunications, which Privilege the French Kings Clergy strenuously
maintained against this usurping Pope Paschal; who though he miscarried in his
Design of stripping the Emperor and King of France of their right of
Investitures, yet he so terrified the King of Hungary with his Thunderbolts,
that after a great Schism and contention between them, Literis graviter
scriptis renunciavit Pontifici Investituras Episcoporum and aliorum
Praelatorum; as the Cent: Magd. 12. c. 8. col. 1133.
Century Writers inform us out of Martinus Capel. But these Letters being not
extant, we cannot resolve upon what terms, or how far he quitted this his
ancient indubitable Prerogative royal, to this Pope.

Before I proceed to the next Popes Contests with the Emperor, I cannot but
inform you what censure Chronicon Editione Francofurti 1566. f. 133, 134.
Sigebertus Gemblacensis Monachus (living and dying under Pope Paschal, in the
year of Christ, 1112.) has given in his Chronicle of this Controversy between
the Emperors and Popes about the right of Investitures.

Anno 1111. Henricus Rex Romam vadit propter sedandam discordiam quae erat
inter Regnum and Sacerdotium, quae caepit a Papa Gregorio septimo, qui and
Hildebrandus nominatus est, et exagitata a successoribus ejus Victory and
Urbano, et prae omnibus a Paschali, magno scandalo erat toto mundo. Rex autem
uti misprinted nolens.
volens authoritate et consuetudine et authoralibus privilegiis Imperatorum,
qui a Carolo Magno, qui post de Regibus Francorum imperavit Romany; jamque per
trecentos et eo amplius annos imperaverant sub 63 Apostolicis, dabat licite
Episcopatus et Abbatias, et per Annulum et per Virgam. Contra hanc majorum
authoritatem censebant Papae Synodali judicio, non posse nec debere dari per
Virgam vel per Annuium Episcopatum, aut aliquam Ecclesiasticam Investituram a
Laicali manu, et quicunque ita Episcopatum, aut aliam Ecclesiastici juris
Investituram accipiebant, excommunicabantur; Propter hanc praecipue causam Rex
Romam tendebat. After which he recites the Here, p. 330.
forementioned Charter and Oath of Pope Paschal and his Cardinals, confirming
this ancient right of Investitures to the Emperor, and their perfidious
violations thereof, upon which many prodigies and calamities ensued. I shall
hereunto subjoyn these passages out of Annalium Boiorum, l. 6. p. 480, 485,
486, 490.
Joannes Aventinus, relating the original and progress of the Contests between
this Emperor, Pope Paschal and his predecessors touching Investitures.

Per triginta tres annos a Gregorio and Urbano continenter sanguine ovium
belligratum est, etc. donec Augustum Paschalis per filium Henricum e fastigio
rerum in privatum statum deturbavit, pollicitus se in Germaniam ad Conventum
solennem Augustam Rhaetiae venturum. Dumque eo contendit, certior fit de morte
Augusti (Henr. 4.) ad Padum ergo substitit, atque coacto suae partis Coetu,
acta Gregorii Urbanique comprobat, Clementis tertii, caeterorum Episcoporum
atque Augusti rescindit; pollui Religionem, si quispiam sacrificus suffragio
prophano cooptatus fuerit, fidemve principi dederit. Necesse est cuivis
Christiano in Romani Pontificis leges jurare, decernit, See here, p. 325.
etc. Proinde debere homines consideratius jam loqui cum illo, atque pro
legibus habere quae dicat. Quicquid adversus Romanum Senatum Pontificalemve se
extulerit, contundendum esse decernit. Conventu peracto ad Caesarem Legatos cum
mandatis mittit, se in Germaniam venturum, ubi de summis utriusque rebus
colloquatur, promittit. Inde Romam ipse, at Caesar Reginoburgum ad hyemandum
petit, adventum Paschalis praestolatur, Verum is se in Gallias Cluniacum
confert. Postea Augustobonae in Trecassiorum, and Galliae Lugdunensis Vrbe,
conciliato sibi Galliae Episcoporum favore, ad captandum plebis auram, leges
turbulentissimas rogat atque perfert. Caesarem de creandis Pontificibus ad
disquisitionem vocat: ipsum Pontificalibus Comitiis excludit; ea ad Plebem
transfert, nempe communem omnium Pastorem, communiter omnium suffragio
capiendum esse statuit; pollui religionem, si quispiam sacris addictus
caelestis atque immortalis Imperatoris Caeremoniarum consors sit, terreno atque

Episcopis jusjurandum exactum, futuros in potestate Romani Pont. Hereupon the
Emperor Henry the 5. in defense of his ancient Imperial Rights and Jurisdiction
against these Papal encroachments, by his public Proclamations declared, and
per Edicta ita obnunciat; Non licere Gallis curiosis, aliena, quae nihil ad eos
attinent, curare; cuilibet facile esse de alieno largiri. Christiani orbis
Imperium sibi a Deo Opt. Max. impositum esse; proinde se de veteri more, et

daturumque jure suo operam, ne quid Respublica detrimenti capiat. Extare
vetustissimam Sanctissimorum Patrum Legem tempore Caroli Magni perlatam, quae
Paschalis, atque cum eo sentientes, per omnium Sacerdotum religiones
devoventur, atque proscribuntur. Nullo pacto fas jusque esse fastuoso
Pontifici, levissimis Gallis, magis superstitiosis, quam Religiosis, tot divos,
tot pientissimos Pontifices maximos, minores Mystas, Monachos, Reges,
Imperatores, Superos atque Caelites impietatis condemnare; se quoad vita
suppetat, non passurum, ut instituta a majoribus accepta, per tot annos
hactenus observata, fraud et astu paucorum, cum maximo Christianorum morum
pernicie, obliterentur, Pontifices, Episcopos, mystas, Monachos ab
Imperatoribus, atque Regibus collocupletatos esse; Ubi his pares opibus facti
sunt, more perditorum, quo plura donata fuerint, plura concupiscere, illi^que

paulatim etiam populum, Sacerdotes, Episcopos alios in ordinem atque servitutem

pacto repeti queant, vertant. Pontifices Romanos orbis Imperium animo cogitare,

tandem pro Deo adoraturos, exigant. In hanc sententiam multae ultro citroque
datae sunt Epistolae. Novissime Caesar rescripsit: Quamvis veterem
consuetudinem atque ritum a tot sanctissimis Patribus per tot annos observatum,
jure atque armis retinere possit, nihil tamen sua refer, si Pontificalibus
Comitiis excidat; modo Episcopi, mystae, Monachi praedia stipendiaria, fiscos,

Atque ad hanc legem promulgandam jam Paschalis Romam ex Galliis redierat; where
forgetting, rescinding all his premised Promises, Charter, Oaths, Obligations
to the Emperor, (recited by Aventinus) he stirrs up all the G^rman Prelates,
(whereof the Archbishop of Mentz was the ringleader) to conspire and rebel
against him, when he expected nothing but Peace and Unity.

stupra, incestus, sacrilegia passim committuntur; caedes, incendia impune
fiunt. Augustus se quoque tutaturus Agrippinam Coloniam petit, agris circa

the Emperors Patrimony, not Peter's) tuncque vox caelitus audita (uti a
gravissimis accepi Theologis) Venenum melle litum foeminam propinasse. The Pope
seizing on her pretended Legacy, the Emperor hereupon to recover his right, and
chastise him for his premised Conspiracies and Rebellion, Augustus cum exereitu
Italiam intrat, Machtyldae opes jure hereditario (nam cognata fuerit) possedit;
but before his arrival at Rome Pope Paschal died. This Papal Usurper (as Annal.
Boiorum l. 6. p. 491
Aventinus observes) was the first Pope who set the year and date of his Papacy
to his Letters and Bulls instead of the Emperors, and granted immunities to
Colleges built by others. Priores Pontifices Romani ad diplomata, Epistolas,
libellos omnes hactenus Imperatoris annos addiderunt, primus Paschalis hisce
tacitis, suae potestatis numerum adscripsit, (which other Bishops since
usurped) huncque primum immunitate donasse Collegia, licet ab aliis extructa,
reperio.

Joannes Cajetanus, styled Gelasius Secundus, was chosen Pope by some of the
Romans and Cardinals, without the Emperors privity, yet with great dissension.
Nam cum sine Imperatoris consensu eligeretur Cincius quidam Fregepanis dictus,
Patricius Vrbis potentissimus, illius injuriam non ferens, ad Palladii
Monasterium, ubi Cardinales erant congregati, cum satellibus armatis venit,
Imperatoris injuriam ulturus; Cupiebant enim hac in part tum authoritatem
Imperatoris conservare, sicuti fidem ei dedissent, tum Ecclesiae patriaeque
suae consulere. Cum autem monitionibus precibusque nullus daretur locus, impetu
in Coventiculum Cardinalium facta, Cincius in eos irrumpens, refractis foribus,
obvium quemque percussit; Pontificem obtorto ejus collo in terram dejectum
calcibus contrivit, in vinculaque protrusit, ne sedem ascendat, donec Imp. ea
de re certior factus esset. Cardinales autem fugam parantes ex mulis et equis
dejecit, nullumque genus contumeliae praetermisit, quo affici tantus Senatus
posset. Sed non tulit tantam injuriam populus Romanus, quin auxilio Normannorum
eum tandem liberaverit, and hosts ad pedum oscula compulerit. Hinc Imperator
Henricus (to vindicate his Imperial Jurisdiction and right in the Popes
election and removal of this Intruder) Exercitum magnum ex Germania Romam
misit. Gelasius hereupon, conscious of his guilt and inability to resist, cum
suis Cajetam navigio mox petiit, ibique Sacerdos factus est, cum solum Diaconus
ante creatus fuisset Pontifex. Henricus Romam veniens absente Gelasio (by his
Imperial Sovereignty and Privilege) Mauritium Burdinum Bracharensem
Archiepiscopum pontificem creavit, ac Gregorium octavum vocavit, eumque
familiae Frangepanum commendans tuendum, inde abiit. Quo audito Gelasius clam
redit, and sumpto animo prodit in aedem Praxedis, Missam facturus. Ubi ab
adversaria part ita fuit impetitus, ut aegre fuga suae incolumitati
consuleret. Animadvertens igitur Pontifex se imparem iis quos Caesar jusserat
Burdini parts defendere, gravi concitata seditione, quasi faetore suo relicto,
ipse iterum in fugam dilabitur. Elapsus difficulter manibus suorum hostium,
Pisas navigavit, atque inde in Galliam solvit, ad portum S Aegidii, and
consecratis in via inter eundum aliquot Ecclesiis, scilicet S. Caeciliae in
Stagello, S. Sylvestri in Tullano, and S. Stephani in Tornaco. (Christum
nullibi praedicabat) lapidibus earum terminos notabat. Chron. Ann. 1118. p. 262.
Abbas Uspergensis relates, that this Pope in contempt of the Emperor and
Magistracy, assembled a kind of Synod at Capua of his conjured Prelates,
wherein Caesarem cum Antipapa Burdino (quem vocat idolum Caesaris) damnavit,
inde in Galliam iter facit. Ab Abbate demum Cluniacensi peramice exceptu^ est,
ac pleurifi correptus Anno Domini 1119. post unum sui Pontificatus annum and
aliquot dies, obiic mortem, in eodem sepultus Caenobio.

Abbas Chronicon, Anno 1119. Cent. Magd. 12 p. 1269.
Uspergensis, Onuphrius, and others inform us, that after the death of Pope
Paschal the 2d, the Emperor Henry hastening to Rome to provide a Pope to
succeed him, primo quidem in electione Domini Johannis, qui and Gelasius 2.
dictus est assensum praebens, postea vero eodem se a communione subtrahente,
cum noluisset Investituram Praelatorum Heinrico confirmare, ideo sede dejectus
est ab Imperatore, qui non sine quorundam Romanorum favore, quendam Burdinum ex
Hispania supervenientem, Apostolicae sedi imposuit, sicque scisma quod jam
sperabatur emortuum, crudeliter revixit.

Annalium, l. 6. p. 491.
Joannes Aventinus relates, that Paschali vita defuncto, Romani certiorem
faciunt Imperatorem, petunt ut Romam veniat, atque Comitia Pontificalia cum
Sacerdotibus Senatu populoque, more majorum habeat. Inter haec quidem Joannem
Cajetanum Magistrum Epistolarum Pontificem designant, Gelasium adpellant, is
ubi adventare ad Vrbem Imperatorem accepit in Galliam aufugit, tertio ab
Augusto et Romany revocatus rediere ad ovile noluit, Cluniaci obiit. Tum
quintus Romani veteri consuetudine Mauritium Burdinum Archiepiscopum Braccensem
Hispanum pontificem legunt, Gregorium Octavum adpellant. Profugi dissimulata
hujus consecratione, Vidonem Archiepiscopum Viennensem Germanum, Stephani
Burgundionum Tetrarcha, Avunculum Baldovini Flandrini Consanguineum
Imperatoris, Pontificatui Maximo imponunt, Calistum vocant. Is a sociis

atque in vincula conjectus est. Quintus impar factioni Pontificum Romanorum,
Anno 1119.
diffidens rebus suis, atque eventum causae desperans, cum Calisto in gratiam
rediit, ex summaque discordia Principes Romani reconciliati sunt. Augustus
Comitiis Pontificalibus, clientela Episcoporum destitutus, arbitrio Coetus
Ecclesiastici excidit Pontificatus universi, sacerdotiaque beneficia Romani
Pontificis facta sunt. Thus Aventinus in brief. Abbas Uspergensis, Sigebertus,
Platina, Martinus Polonus, Stella, Hermannus Schedel, Barns, Balaeus,
Onuphrius, and Centur. Magd. 12. in Calixto 2. Krantzius Saxoniae. l. 5. c. 40,

Abbas Vspergensis, Albertus Krantzius, Platina, and others quoted in the
margin, render us this larger Narrative of the election and proceedings, of
Calistus. Pope Gelasius deceasing in the Abbey of Cluny, Anno 1119. the
fugitive Cardinals of his faction assembling in that Abbey in opposition to the
Emperor, and support of the Hildebrandian Faction, created Calixtus the 2d.
Pope, in the life of Burdinus whom the Emperor had made Pope, and styled
Gregory the 8. Contra Burdinum igitur Calixtus non prius capit arma, quam
Caesarem sua Excommunicatione compulisset, ut sibi praeberet suffragium et
extorsisset Investiturae Episcoporum privilegium; To which end Calixtus sent
Conon his Legate into Germany to excommunicate the Emperor, in order to deprive
him of his Crown. This Excommunication being publicly denounced first at
Colen, and then at Friburgh in a German Synod of Bishops, thereupon coactus est
Imperator (to post out of Italy into Germany) apud Triburiam Conventum
Episcoporum and Principum agere, ut concordia inter ipsum and Papam statim
procuraretur. Et ne Pontificum art regno (ut ejus piissimus Pater) exueretur,
conditiones Pacis valde iniquas admisit. Missis Triburiam Oratoribus, Calixti
hujus electionem ad summum sui dedecus confirmare cogitur, (vivo ad huc
Gregorio seu Burdino, quem ipse pontificem prius fecerat) ne velit a dignitate
sui Imperii excidere. Hoc scilicet erat caput rei, and causa cur regnum Romanum
concuteretur. The Pope and his Confederates not satisfied with this his great
condescension in the Council at Friburg, Pontificis Legati and Episcopi deinde
perurgentes eum, ut de jure suo investiendi Praelatos cederet, atque tradat
Romano Praesuli, id enim postulare ipsum securissime et strictissime. Thereupon
the Emperor, who in a former Council at Aventinus Annal. Bo^orum, l. 6. Here p.
341, 342. Morney Hist. Papatus, p. 283, 284.
Mentz asserted, Christiani orbis Imperium sibi a Deo Opt. Max. impositum esse,
proinde se de veteri more et ritu priscae religionis, sacris Supremae
Magistratus placitis non defuturum, etc. insisting upon his ancient undoubted
right, multa ultro citroque de hac re disputantur: Sed velle Pontificis
praeponderat. In tantas igitur angustias Caesar redactus, et aut cedendum suo
veteri jure, aut regnum amittendum esset; petit inducias and potestatem cum
Principibus conferendi; Sed illi perterriti atque examinati paene tam potentis
Praesulis Romani fulmine, ad unum omnes suadent, cedendum esse voluntati Papae,
ni velit sese universamque Germaniam in extremum discrimen adducere. Consulit
porro amicos atque adversarios, verum nihil solatii uspiam audit. Expugnatus
itaque Caesar; quasi supplices manus porrigit, necessitatique, tanquam
durissimo telo, parendum esse dicernit; (Sic ejus tandem Dominus retaliabat
proditiones in pientissimum patrem suum, as Balaus and others observe.)
Hereupon, Percepta illa grata fama, Caesarem voluntati Papae, seujugo, sese
submittere, non sibi celandum putat Calixtus, sed absque mora, ad S. Lucam
Conventum indicit ad 13. Calend. Novembris. Promiserant autem qui Triburiae
fuerant se ad eum locum venturos, quem Papa designasset. Vicinum quoque Caesar
sese praebet, sicut Catalaudensis Episcopus, and Cluniacensis Abbas cum Henrico
Argentinae transegerant. Adfuerunt autem ipsi Calixto circiter 426. Patres,
innumera Clericorum and populi multitudo. Vlcus erat Investiturae negotium quam
tenebant Laici, inter quos princeps erat Caesar Romanus. Legati Imperatoris
Henrici sua proferunt privilegia antiqua a Pontificibus obsignata, et diuturnam
possessionem, et jus ipsum atque aequitatem; sed eis se Papa Calixtus cum suis
creaturis pro Authoritate opponit, omnia antiqua jura repudians, et mandans, se
velle id dignitatis sibi attribui. Legati singulari reverentia, inducias
ulterius petunt, et vix extorquent. Papa autem nihilominus Synodalia suorum
antecessorum decreta confirmat, hoc est, decernit jus investiendi Episcopos
penes Episcopos Romanos, et non penes Caesarem esse: (being against all rules
of Law, reason, justice, the sole Judge in his own cause, and pronouncing
sentence for himself): and sic omnem suam potentiam adversus Caesarem dirigit.
Hoc pacto diebus duodecim Synodus ista finitur. In Italiam deinde Papa reversus
maxima pompa, ut Papam Caesarem decebat excipitur. And here we may behold the
proper Genius of the Popes and Popish Prelates, when ever they were in
distress, and needed the Emperors and other Princes aid to assist and defend
them against their Potent adversaries, they would then cry up, ratify and
confirm their Sovereign Power and Patronage over themselves, and all other
Churches, and ratify their right of electing, confirming Popes, and of
Investitures, by Canons, Councils, Oaths, Instruments, but no sooner were they
reestablished in their Chairs by them, but presently upon the first advantage
they violated, abjured, revoked all their former Oaths, Canons, Engagements,
and excommunicated, dethroned, and trampled them under their feet, with highest
scorn, contempt, like most perfidious ungrateful Traitors. Anno sequenti, hoc
est Vigesimo, in Germania Episcopis Papa literis praecipit, ut vacantibus
Cathedris Canonice, uti loquebatur, Pastores eligerent. Hac ratione and
decretis, and ipsa praxi, licet inducias verbis dedisset, ne tamen ipsa Papa
Caesari jus investiendi Episcopos eripit. Moguntinus Praesul Albertus (seu
Adelbertus) Romano Papae Caesari addictus omnem Romano Imperatori Reverentiam
detrectabat. Itaque Henricus eum persequitur. Pelluntur and Spirensis and
Wormatiensis Episcopi suis sedibus, quia in gratiam Papae nolebant Imperatori
communicare. Sed Moguntinus Duces Saxoniae extimulat, ut arma contra Caesarem
sumant, et hisce facibus accensi Saxones ante Moguntiam exercitui Caesaris suas
opponunt copias, neque procul aberat res a cruento praelio. Sed Sapientum
quorundam interventu duodecim Primates ex utraque part deliguntur, qui de
rebus inter Regnum and Sacerdotium, uti loquuntur Scriptores, componendis,
consultarent, atque statuerent. Locus denominatur Herbipolis, seu Wirtzburg ad
diem Michaelis, Anno Domini 1121. Veniunt autem eo armati utraque pars, ac
consultatio inchoatur. Tandem Septimana integra controversiis agitatis,
sancitur pax tali pacto, ut regalia vel fiscalia regno, Ecclesiastica Ecclesiis
praedia spoliatis, Haereditates haeredibus manerent, and cuilibet personae sua
tribueretur justitia. Praedones ac fures edictis Imperialibus, and juxta leges
antiquas cohercendo^. Scandala and perturbationes excitatas in Germania, omni
ratione sedandus and extirpandas. Excommunicatione unde ista mala omnia
scaturirent, ad Apostolici regiminis audientiam esse rejiciendam. Denominati
etiam sunt Legati Bruno Episcopus Spirensis, and Arnulfus Abbas Fuldensis, qui
Romam istam concordiae rationem perferrent, ac Papam de Generali Concilio in
Germania instituendo sollicitarent. Anno sequenti mortuo Herbipolensi,
Imperator Gebhardum constituit Episcopum; Sed alii Ruggerum diligunt, ac
Moguntinus quidem contra Imperatorem eum confirmat instigantibus Legatis
Pontificiis qui venerant, ut contra Imperatorem facerent omnia.

Redeuntes Spirensis and Fuldensis ex Italia, secum adaucunt Papae Caesaris
Legatos, plenissima instructos potestate ad transigendum omnia, quae ad
Caesarem Papamque pertinerent: nempe Lambertum Ostiensem, Saxonem, Sancti
Stephani, and Gregorium Sancti Angeli Cardinales. Hi vultures Romani mox
Wormatiae indicunt Conventum Principibus and Episcopis, Caesare adstipulante.
Nam ille nunc se passive quidem habebat, prostratus ictu Pontificio, ac cermens
se necessitatem praesentem nulla vi effugere posse. Caput disputationis est
Investitura Episcoporum, quam e manibus Laicorum omni Authoritate et vi
extorquendum esse, Papa Romanus decreverat. Etsi autem plurima de jure
Caesaris, et usu diuturno antecessorum, deque plurium Pontificum permissione,
et comprobatione in medium afferrentur, tamen vicit,

Sic volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas.

Nam Magistratus Politicus debebat (juxta ipsius 2 Pet. 2. 10.
Petri vaticinium, ab hususmodi hominibus summa ignominia affici, atque egregie
pedibus conculcari. Caesar licet aegerrime ferret, tantam sibi plagam a Papa
infl^gi. tamen excommunicationis terrore, et quod Papa omnes suos Principes
fascinasset, atque ad horribilem defectionem permo vislet, Patrisque metuens
exemplum (after an whole weeks contest, and more) fractus, cedit invitus tantae
violentiae; Imperiique tranquillitatem suis commodis ac dignitati propriae
anteponit, Pontificique suum jus investiendi tradit: Et Legato Apostolicae
sedis (qui postea et Summus Pontifex factus) resignavit, per eumque ab
anthematis vinculo solutus est; Haec praedaistis retibus capta, Legati eum
nodis anathematis exolvunt, atque potestatem faciunt, ad Ecclesiae coetum, unde
eum excluserant, redeundi. Vt autem nihilominus istam aviculam arctissime
constrictam tenerent, catissiimeque ut illi monebat ducerent, Nota.
formulam concordiae utrinque datis Literis sigillisque appensis corroborant,
atque ut omnibus quam notissima esset victoria et Caesaris probrum, eas literas
in loco campestri spaciosissimo prope Rhenum, clara voce proclamant ac
denunciant.

Formulae vero sunt ejusmodi: Ego Heinricus, Dei gratia Imperator Augustus, pro
amore Dei, et Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae, et Domini Papae Calixti, et pro
remedio animae meae, dimitto Deo, et Sanctis ejus Apostolis Petro et Paulo,
Sanctaeque Catholicae Ecclesiae, omnem Investituram per Annulum et Baculum: et
concedo in omnibus Ecclesiis fieri electionem et liberam consecrationem.
Possessiones et regalia beati Petri, quae a Principio hujus discordiae usque ad
hodiernum diem, sive tempore Patris mei, sive etiam meo ablata sunt, quae
habeo, eidem Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae restituo; quae autem non habeo, ut
restituantur fideliter juvabo. Et do veram pacem Calixto, Sanctaeque Romanae
Ecclesiae, et omnibus qui in part ipsius sunt vel fuerunt, et in quibus Sancta
Romana Ecclesia aurilium postulaverit, fideliter juvabo.

Literae a Pontifice Imperatori vicissim datae hae sunt. Ego Calixtus Servus
Servorum Dei, Dilecto filio Heinrico, Dei Gratia Romanorum Imperatori Augusto,
Which he ever did, and might do, without this Papal grant.
Concedo Electionem Episcoporum et Abbatum Tentonici Regni, qui ad regnum
pertinent, in praesentia tua fieri, absque Simonia, et aliqua violentia. Et si
quae inter parts discordia emerserit, Metropolitani, and comprovincialium
Concilo vel Iudicio, saniori parti assensum and auxilium praebeas. Electus
autem regalia per sceptrum a te recipiat, (exceptis omnibus quae ad Romanam
Ecclesiam pertinere noscuntur) et quae ex iis jure tibi debet, faciat. Ex aliis
vero partibus Imperii consecratus, infra sex menses regalia per sceptrum a te
recipiat. De quibus vero si querimoniam feceris, secundum officii mei debitum
auxilium praestabo. Doque tibi veram pacem, and omnibus qui in part tua sunt
vel fuerunt tempore hujus discordiae. Datae Anno 2122. 9 Calendas Octobris.
Estque observatione dignissimum, quod Otto Frisingensis annotat. Hoc pro bono
pacis Henrico soli concessum esse, et non successoribus ipsius. Attend igitur
quam honest, and candide illi homines agant!

Haec diplomata ubi Romam perlata sunt, incredibilem excitaverunt laetitiam et
tripudium. Vt autem triumphus ille de manubiis Caesari ereptis Communis et
illustrior esset, Sanctissimus Papa Caesar Calixtus 2. eas literas de extorta
resignatione et renunciatione Iuris Caesarei de Investitura Episcoporum, in
Ecclesia Lateranensi public suspendit, ut omnibus et risum et insultationem,
more scilicet vere Apostolico, moverent.

Pope Calixtus having thus publicly triumphed over the Emperor, and forcibly
wrested out of his hands the right of Investitures, after above 46 years hot
contests, and bloody wars about it, between the Imperial Scepter, and Papal
Myter, he next addressed himself to vanquish his Competitor Gregory the 8. by
the Temporal, as he had conquered the Emperor by the Spiritual sword; whereupon

conspiratione suorum facta, more Romuleo, non Petrino, maximas copias mittit
Sutrium, ubi Gregorius se continebat, addito divo Joanne Cremensi, Sancti
Chrysogoni Diacono Cardinali, milite (ut decebat Ecclesiasticum virum) strenuo,
ad oppugnandam Civitatem. Ipse Pontifex ad visitationum, scilicet
Ecclesiasticam, praemisse exercitu cum gladiis, lanceis and tormentis,
pedetentim subsequitur, quia Burdinus adhuc nomen Pontificium arrogabat, quod
electione habebat, Romanos incursionibus infestabat; and ut qui contra se
latrocinia exercebat, peregrinos religionis and suorum negotiorum causa cum
turgida crumena Romam adventantes pecuniis spoliabat, quas Papa, Cardinales,
and sacrifici avide expectabant. Quid fit? Sutrium expugnatione Petrinorum
capitur, Burdinus in potestatem Calixti traditur. Jam attend, quanta clementia
mitissimus Papa erga hunc suum rivalem, usus sit; Burdinum (non sine summa
Caesaris, et Papatus ignominia) crudis and sanguinolentis pellibus caprinis
amictus, per mediam Civitatis, via Regia, ut magis publicaretur educitur, and
imperante Domin^ Papa Calixto, imponitur camelo, capite ad caudam verso,
candamque manu tenentem, publiceque omnibus deridendum and conspuendum
exponitur; tandemque monasterio eum tanquam in carcerem intrudit, and ad tantae
ultionis memoriae conservationem, in camera palacii sub pedibus Calixti
conculcatum depinxerunt. Calixtus by these triumphant conquests of the Emperor
and Antipope, made the Church of Rome to increase into a Great mountain, as
Otto Frisingensis and others observe, unde de eo Romae scriptum, Otto Frising.

By these Canons, this Pope and his Successors since engrossed into their own
hands the disposal of most Archbishopricks, Bishoprics, and other preferments,
which they bestowed on their Creatures, or those who would give most money for

Sovereignty against the Emperor and his Successors, and thereby See Mr. Tyndals

monopolized into their hands the Government of the Empire, and all Christian
Realms, all Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, dignities, and the whole Clergy being
thenceforth solely dependant upon the Pope, not Emperor, Kings, Princes; who in
that and subsequent ages were both Legates, sworn Vassals, Homagers to the Pope,
and the Grand swaying Officers of State, Privy Counselors, Chancellors,
Treasurers, Secretaries, as well as Confessors to the Emperor, the Kings of
England, France, Spain, Hungary, Poland, Denmark, Scotland, and other Princes;
siding with the Pope against the Emperor, Kings, Princes, their Crowns and
Interests, whenever they came in competition with the Popes usurped Supremacy
and Jurisdiction, and betraying their secrets unto him.

Rupertus Tuitiensis Abbas, Anno 1120.
a learned Author flourishing under this Pope, l 9. in Mat. c. 11. writes thus
against these usurpations. Viro spiritualis propositi non conceditur evaginare
gladium. Rupertus in Matthew. l. 8.
Virga Discipulorum Christi, est virga Pastoralis Officii, super curam animarum
solicit vigilantis; Illam namque virgam quae Dominationis est non esse
concessam Ministris Evangelii Pacis (much less then the swords) interdici imo
hic, etc. Idem l. 11. c. 13. in Johan.
Christi Ministri sciant Apostolatum non esse Dominium, sed summae Humilitatis
Ministerium, ut ponant animas pro fratribus suis. And if this be not
sufficient, he thus quite subverts the foundation of Peter's and the Popes
Supremacy. Idem l. 2. c. 2. in Johan.
Christus super seipsum, videlicet firmam petram, suam aedificat Ecclesiam. Et
mutato nomine, Petrus a petra denominatum, per quod significatum est, quia
cunctis super illud fundamentum (quod est Christus) aedificantur, juxta
Prophetam vocandum sit nomen novum quod os Domini nunciavit. And what that name
is, St. Peter himself defines, 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5. Ad quem accedentes quasi ad
lapidem vivum, and ipsi tanquam lapides vivi, (the same with Peter)
superaedificamini domus spiritualis, etc.

Omnibus enim terribiles erant Romani Pontifices excommunication^s fulminae, qui

though the Emperor having quitted the right of Investitures as aforesaid, durst
not to claim or assert, yet the Kings of England and France did strenuously
exercise, assert Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over Bishops and their Churches,
and collated to all Ecclesiastical Dignities, notwithstanding Calixtus Decrees:
as is evident by these memorable Passages in the Epistles of Hildebertus
Caenomanensis Episcopus flourishing in that age: Hildeberti Caenoman. Episcopi

taking upon him to dispose of the Deanery Archdeaconry, and Prebendaries

75 Epistle he complains, That not so much as one of his Friends defended his
or his Churches cause with the King of France, to procure their peace. Silent
amici, silent Sacerdotes Jesu Christi, denique silent and illi, quorum
suffragio credidi Regem mecum in gratiam rediturum, etc. ne sagittas suas in
seen compleret Sacerdote, ne sanctiones Canonicas evacuaret, ne persequeretur

Although this Bishop complained thus of these Kings to this Pope and others,
yet he declaimed more bitterly against the Corruptions of the Pope and Court of
Rome, in one of his Epistles, omitted in the Jesuits Edition of their
Bibliotheca Patrum, Cent. Magd. 12. col. 42, 43. Morney Hist. Papatus, p. 291.
Romani sunt quos timent and qui timentur; Hi sunt quos haec peculiariter

adhibiti, impediunt praetermissi, fastidiunt admoniti, obliviscuntur
locupletati. Hi sunt, qui emunt lites, vendunt intercessiones, deputant
arbitros, judicanda dictant, dictata convellunt, attrahunt litigaturos,
protrahunt audiendos: trahunt addictos, retrahunt transigentes. Hi sunt, quod
si petas, and nullo adulante beneficium promittunt, pudet negare, paenitet
praestitisse. Hi sunt, qui negant reverentiam Clericis, originem Nobilibus,

hominum, ordinum, temporum cordi est. In foro Scythae, in cubiculo viperae, in
convivio scurrae, in exactionibus harpyae, in collocutionibus statuae, in
questionibus bestiae, in tractatibus cochleae, in contratibus trapezitae. Ad
intelligendum saxei, ad judicandum lignei, ad succensendum flammei, ad
ignoscendum ferrei, ad amicitias pardi, ad facetias Vrsi, ad fallendum Vulpes,
ad superbiendum Tauri, ad consumendum Minotauri. Spes firmas in rerum motibus

ne discutiantur, bella ne pugnent. Quorum si nares afflaverit rubiginosi aura
marsupii, confestim videbis illic, and occulos Argi, and manus Briarei, and

In his 82 Epistle to Pope Honorius the 2. he thus declaimes against Appeals
to Rome. Bibliotheca Patrum, Tom. 12. pars 1. p. 346, 347.
Honorio Deigratia Excellentissimo and Reverendissimo Patri suo Sanctaeque
Romanae Ecclesiae Summo Pontifici, H. humilis Turonum Minister, debitae
integritatem obedientiae. Philosophus, ait, colere officis, non exasperare
verbis oportet potestatem. Ideo cumulatis precibus exoro, ne vos Reverende
Pater, scriptum praesens exasperet, aut velitis de necessitate praesumptionem
figurare. Etenim necessitate scripsi, eodem quo sum laesus jaculo, laedi
metuens Ecclesiae sospitatem. Bonam spem in sinu meo gero, quia scribens pro
justitia, gratiam Patris non avertam. Quaslibet igitur Appellationes in Romana
vigere et suscipi Ecclesia, cis Alps auditum non est, nec ex sacris traditum
institutis. Quod si forte hujusmodi emersit Appeals to Rome from this side the
Alps, a Novelty then first introduced, and thus oppugned.
novitas, ut placeat omnem indifferenter admittere Appellationem, Pontificalis
censura peribit et omnino conteretur Ecclesiasticae robur disciplinae. Quis
enim raptor ad solam Anathematis comminatinem non statim Appellabit? Quis
Clericus aut Presbyter, frustratoriae Appellationis refugio non putrebit, aut
etiam sepelietur in stercore suo? Quis Episcopus habebit in promptu, non omnem
dico, sed aliquam ulcisci inobedientiam? Ejus virgam quaevis Appellatio
quassabit, solvet constantiam, severitatem emolliet, adducens et illi
silentium, et reis impunitatem delictorum? sic fiet ut sacrilegia ac rapinae,
fornicationes ac adulteria pernicioso inundent incremento, cum Praesul ad
superfluas Appellationes clauserit ora, et desierit persequi piorum
persecutores locorum, cum viduarum injurias desierit ulcisci et Orphanorum.
Dilatione nimirum censurae facinora fovebuntur, et venient in profundum
iniquitatis impune delinquentes; super quos Evangelicum illud implebitur
praeceptum, Luke 14.
Exi cito in plateas, and vicos Civitatis, and pauperes ac debiles and caecos,
and claudos introduc huc. Quis vel caecum vel claudum intrare compellat, si
caecus, cum compelletur, appellet? Denique pro delicto Heli, nullus Pontificum
punietur, quoniam Appellationis excusatione suam quisque defenderet offensam.
Exempla quaedam censurae semper vivent, aemulatores autem ejus, quaelibet
Appellatio sepelicet and vivos. Sane parva est materia, and exilis scientia,
quae si (juxta Job 39.
Job) Inter aquilas in praeruptis lusitantes cum pullis earum sanguinem lambit,
satis est. Non erubesco meam and attendere and profiteri mensuram. Inter
caeteros tamen Sacerdotes ad me pervenit, quas Appellationes Cisalpina
susceperit Ecclesia, quas et sine offensione, sedis Apostolicae renuit et
abjecit. Accepi enim, and universitas Ecclesiae praedicat, quod gravatis
judicio, subventus Appellationis debeatur. Accepi, quod suspectos habens
judices aut infestos, aut formidans vim temerariae multitudinis, eodem remedio
possit and debeat relevari. Vnde etiam in Gratian, Cause. 2. qu. 6.
Decretis Cornelii Papae, taliter Ecclesiae traditum est: Si quis Judicem
adversum sibi senserit, vocem Appellationis exhibeat, quod nulli oportet
negari. Item in eodem, Nullus Sacerdotum causam suam alieno committat judicio
nisi ad sedem Apostolicam fuerit Appellatum, sed unusquisque comprovinciales
Judices and notos habeat, nisi aliquem vim temerariae multitudinis illic
timuerit, aut infestos vel suspectos Judices ibi habuerit; pro quibus causis ad
majoris authoritatis Judices, and ad alias provincias appellare and venire
concessum est. Andivi etiam alias quoque Appellationes esse, sed moratorias nec
aliquando recipiendas, de quibus in sacris legibus his legimus verbis.
Quicunque non confidentia justae causae, sed causa afferendae morae ne contra
eum sententia proferatur Appellaverit, and si de facto suo confessus ne
addicatur Appellare voluerit, hujusmodi Appellationes non recipiuntur. Et
quidem videri mihi plures talium Appellationum species, quas prudens Judex ita
necesse est discernat, ut circa Judicandos debitam in omnibus servat aequitatem
Porro ea quae Praerogativam obtinent, sicut parvitati meae ministravit
authoritat, perstrinxerit, quae si plura sunt; etiam usque ad ipsius Cathedrae
vestrae sedem Apostolicam incurrere vigilantia: confiteor non transgrediendos
esse terminos quos posuerunt Patres nostri; Moratorias autem Appellationes
omnino a vestra relegandas esse audientia, nec sustinendum in horto Domini
plantari toxicum mortis; toxicum quo subventus afflictorum morietur, quo
justitia in nihilum reverteretur, incrementum suscipiat ubertas delictorum.

thereupon writ this Epistola 40. Bibliotheca Patrum, Tom. 12. pars 1. p. 325.

Arguam te, et statuam contra faciem tuam. In which passage, it is remarkable;
1. That this famous Bishop and Archbishop, (one of the first who wrested the
two swords in Luke 22. to typifie only the temporal and ecclesiastical Swords
of Jurisdiction) directly resolves, the sword that Peter used in cutting off
Malchus his ear, to be the Temporal sword, belonging to the King, not
Spiritual, which was then hid amongst the other Apostles, but not drawn forth
by Peter or Christ against those who laid violent hands upon, and crucified
him. How then this later sword can belong to Peter, Popes, or Prelates alone,
by divine right, let Pontificians resolve the world when they are able. 2ly.
That he asserts, the King to be the Supreme Member in the body of Christ, to
whom St. Peter's sword appertains; not the Pope, Bishops, or Priests, who have
only that sheathed sword which Peter and the other Apostles did not then draw
forth. 3ly. That so long as the Kings sword is drawn, exercised in and for the
Church, or its Members; the Spiritual sword of Excommunication ought not to be
drawn or used. 4ly. That the Ecclesiastical Sword equally belongs to every
Bishop, Angel, Priest of God, as much as to St. Peter, or the Pope, who may
lawfully draw it out, when ever there is occasion, without the Popes
Commission, License, Permission. 5ly. You may hence observe, how much this Text
has been See Baronius Annal. Ann. 1053. Sect. 10. Bellarmin de Romano Pont. l.
5. c. 5.
perverted by Popes and their Advocates, to maintain the Popes title to the
Supreme Temporal and Spiritual swords of Authority and Jurisdiction in and
over all Christian Kings, Kingdoms, which (as I have Here, p. 63, to 67.
formerly evidenced) make nothing at all for these two Metaphorical Swords,
Jurisdictions, or St. Peter's, or his pretended successors Title to them. For if
we believe In Luc l. 5. See Hill in Mat. Can. 32. In Luc. l. 10. Augustine,
Cassiodorus, Bruno in Psalm. 44. and 49. Dr. Beard Antichrist the Pope of Rome,
p. 197, 198. Marlorat, in Luc. 22.
St. Ambrose, and others, these two swords, which the Apostles then had, and
Christ resolved to be enough, were only the Old and New Testament, which Saint
Peter and the other Apostles were to draw forth, open, explain, and preach to
all Nations for their instruction, the slaying of their sins, errors,
corruptions, pricking them at their hearts, arming them against all the
assaults of the Devil, and for the edification, conversion, defense and
salvation of their souls: Which exposition of theirs is warranted by Luke 24.

Sermo Domini Servatoris; ideo anceps, quoniam duo contineat Testamenta, is the
general and genuine resolution of St. Ambrose, Augustine, Chrysostom, Jerome,
Beda, Cassiodor, Bruno, Lyra, Hugo de Sancto Victore, the Ordinary Gloss, most
Orthodox Interpreters Old and New, on these Texts; This is the only sword
proceeding out of Christ's mouth, which he came to send into the world: which
himself brandished or made use of whilst on earth, and committed to his
Apostles, Ministers, Peter, (or the Roman Pontiffs, admitting them to be his
genuine Successors) after his death and resurrection: not the Supreme Spiritual
or Temporal Coercive Sword of Jurisdiction in and over all Persons, Churches,
Kingdoms, causes whatsoever, as Popes and Pontificians most blindly infer from
hence, against the Letter, true scope of this Text, Exposition of the Fathers,
and their own learned Expositors. 6ly. These words Lu. 22. 36, 38
But now, he that has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one, etc. And
they said, Lord, Behold here are two swords; And he said, they are enough, are
thus interpreted by the Fathers. St. In Lucae Evangel. l. 10.
Ambrose has this Meditation on these words in St. Peter's name; O Domine, cur
emere nos jubes gladium, qui ferrire me prohibes? Cur habere praecipis, cum
vetas promi? nisi forte ut parata sit defensio, non ultio necessaria, and
videar potuisse vindicari, sed noluisse. Lex tamen referire me non vetat: and
ideo fortasse Petro duos gladios offerenti, sat est, dicit; quasi licuerit
usque ad Evangelium; ut sit, in Lege aequitatis eruditio, in Evangelio
bonitatis perfectio. Multis hoc iniquum videtur, sed non iniquus Dominus, qui
cum se possit ulcisci, maluit immolari. Hom. 85. in Mat. Tom. 2. Opera.
St. Chrysostom has the like; Cum illi dixissent, Duos se gladios habere,
Christus satis esse respondit: Cur igitur habere permisit? ut facilius
crederent, quod tradetur: Propterea dixit eis, emat gladium; non ut percutiant
animat, sed ut proditionem per hoc declararet. Propterea Petrus gladio usus
comminatione, and quidem vehementi repraehenditur: Which Beda, Theophylact,
Hugo de Sancto Victore, Lyra, Erasmus, Aretius, Calvin, Beza, Marlorat,
Heinsius, Walaeus, and others on this Text recite, yea second; and Origin
before them, Tract. 35. in Matthew. gives the like interpretation thereof. The
sum, scope of which words they resolve to be this; 1. To give a further check
to the Disciples ambitious spirit and contest for precedence or worldly
grandeur (which he had reprehended immediately before) by minding them of the
persecutions and hardships they should suffer after his passion, ascension, and
thereby advising them to provide against them. 2ly. To instruct them, that in
times of persecution, they might lawfully buy a sword to defend their persons
against private violence; but Mat. 5. 39. c. 10, 17, to 32. Romans 13. 1, to 7. 1
Pet. 2. 12. to 22.
not to resist the public Authority of persecuting Princes, or revenge
themselves. 3ly. That the Disciples misapprehending Christ's meaning, imagining
he commanded each of them personally to buy a sword to defend him from the band
of men armed with swords, staves, that should apprehend and put him to death,
they in their simplicity thought two swords sufficient to effect it, when as
not twelve, nor two hundred swords, much less two, would be sufficient for
that purpose; Whereupon he replied, It is enough: either by way of Ironie, as
some hold; Dominus ironia dixit; Quia duo gladii sunt, omnino multi sunt, and
sufficient nobis contra multitudinem quae venit super nos: Or else rather by
way of diversion to some other discourse, as Theophylacti in Lucam Enarratio,
c. 22. p. 203, 204. Tho. Aquinas Catena in Locum
Theophylact thinks! Haec enim opinor aenigmatice propterea dicebat, ut postea
recordantes and intelligentes, utilitate^ capiant, quoniam tunc adeo
insipientes erant, ut dicunt: Domine hic duo gladii, at ipse quia vidit ipsos
non intellexisse, inquit, Satis est: tametsi nequaquam sufficerent, si humano
auxilio contra honicidas illos uti oportuisset; neque omnium gladii
sufficissent: si autem hoc ^oluissent, and diviniore subsidio opus erat,
superstui fuissent and duo. Veruntamen Dominus noluit eos arguere, utpote nihil
intelligentes, sed dixit, satis est: and processit. Sic igitur etiam nos quando
cum quodam conversantes vidimus cum non intellexisse quid diximus, dicimus;
Been, dimitte; quamvis non sit bonum; sed ne conturbaremus, remittimus. Facit
hic Dominus quando videt discipulos non intelligere dictum; transit, and
eventum rerum explicare dictorum intelligentiam, etc. 4ly. That Christ by this
reply, It is enough, expressed his own willingness to suffer death, without
the least resistance by his Apostles swords, or Compared with Mat. 26. 48, to
59. Isay 53. 7. Acts 8. 32.
any other human or angelical power, and that he would make use of neither of
them to prevent his apprehension or crucifixion. Duo gladii sufficient ad
testimonium sponte passi Salvatoris: Vnus qui and Apostolis audaciam pro Domino
certandi, and avulsaictu ejus auricula (Malchi) Domino etiam morituro pietatem
virtutemque doceret inesse medicandi. Alter qui nequaqam vagina exemptus,
ostenderet eos, ne totum quod potuere pro ejus defe^sione facere permissos; as
our Venerable w Beda expounds these words, living about 750 years after Christ,
and Hugo Cardinalis, Stella, besides others since: 5ly. In Evang. Lucae, l. 6.
c. 22. Tom. 5. p. 428. Chrysostom, Hom. 85. in Mat.
Origin, Hom. 7. in Mat. Lyra in Lucam l. 10.
Ambrose, Aquinatis Catena in Locum.
St. Chrysostom, with other Ancients, Erasmus in his Paraphrase on Luke 22. and
Oecolampadius in Mat. c. 26 conclude from hence, and from Christ's command to
Peter, Put up thy sword into its place, etc. That it is unlawful for
Christians under the Gospel to wage war; since two swords are enough for
Christ's disciples to defend themselves withal, even in times of persecution,
without an offensive or defensive army, which requires thousands of swords, not
two: Yea Sixtus Senensis Bibl. l. 6. Annot. 156, to 158.
Sixtus Senensis himself, who differs from them in opinion, confesses, that
exordio nascentis Ecclesiae, armorumusus minime conveniret. Whence Christ
prohibited his Apostles so much as to take Luke 9. 2. Mat. 10. 10.
two staves, much less two swords, to defend themselves, or offend others.
Finally In Lu. 22. v. 38.
Maldonat, and Cardinal De Romano Pontifice l. 5. c. 5.
Bellarmine in this our age are forced to confess, That these two swords and
the Popes Titles to them cannot be literally deduced from this Text; and Mr.
Calvin concludes, In Luc. 22. and Marlorat ibidem.
Quod hinc eliciunt Canonistae, cornutos suos Episcopos duplici Jurisdictione
esse praeditos, non solum putida est allegoria, sed protervum ludibrium quo
verbo Dei insultant Antichristi mancipia. Wherefore let Here p. 63.
Popes and their Parasites for the future evince their pretended divine Right

Emperors, Kings, Princes, Churches, and Pope Hildebrands and his Successors

Arnulphus a devout, zealous, famous Preacher, coming to Rome whilst Honorius
the 2d sat there in his Pontificalibus, and observing the Roman Clergies
vices, Presbyter Arnolphus, vir doctissimus, magnae devotionis, and praedicator
egregius, qui cum inter annunciandum verbum Dei, Claricorum lasciviam,
libidinem, avaritiam, pompam, divitias, and nimium fastum reprehenderet, and
paupertatem Christi and Apostolorum ejus, integerrimamque vitam ad imitationem
omnibus proponeret, a Romana quidem Nobilitate, ut verus Christi discipulus
laudatus est; sed Cardinalium et Clericorum odio nimium est habitus, a quibus
and noctu captus, occul^e est interfectus. Haec suum Martyrium, antea cum adhuc
esset in Eremo, divinitus sibi fuit revelatum, cum per Angelum, ad praedicandum
Romam mitteretur. Vnde and public dixit, Scio quod animam meam quaeritis, scio
quod me brevi jam occidetis. Sed quare? Veritatem vobis dice; fastum,
superbiam, avaritiam, luxuriam, nimiumque studium quod comparandis divitiis
miseri impenditis, reprehendo; propterea vobis non placeo. Ego testem invoco
coelum and terram, quod annunciaverim vobis ea, quae mihi Dominus praecepit:
vos autem contemnitis and me, and Creatorem vestrum, qui vos per unigenitum
suum filium rede^^it. Nec mirum si hominem me peccatorem, vobis veritatem
annunciantem, morti tralituri estis: Cum etiam si Sanctus Petrus hodie
resurgeret, and vitia vestra, quae minus multiplicata sunt reprehenderet, Nota.
ei minime parceretis. Cum haec alta voce clamasset, subjunxit; Ego quidem
morte^ subire pro veritate non timeo, vobis autem in verbo Domini praedico,
quod omnipotens Deus non parcet impuritatibus vestris. Vos enim omni spurcitia
pleni, plebem vos commissam praeceditis ad infernum. Deus vindex est. Cumque
odium Cleri propter veritatem in eum saevire capisset, eoru^ insidiis captus
and submersus (or as others suspensus) est. Coccius Sabellicus styles this
Foedum facmus a Clero perpetratum: id flagitium totum ordinem infamia aspersit,
culpa tamen paucorum; quam plerique ex iis turpiter viverent, eoque licentiae
processissent, ut ne salubria quidem remedia pati possent. Arnolphum qui magna
nominis celebritate, magnoque mortalium concursa divinam praedicabat legem,
quia eorum vitam increpabat, impie necarunt. He subjoynes, Tulit id facinus
Honorius iniquo animo, caeterum quaestione abstinuit. Therefore doubtless he
assented to it; qui tacet consentire videtur.

St. Bernard Abbot of Clarevall flourishing in that age, Anno 1130.
upon this occasion (as I suppose) thus declaimed against the Prelates
persecution, Tyranny, De Conversione Pauli, Sermo 1. 1. 20.
Videatur jam Ecclesiae persecutionis tempus, sed ut palam factum est, nunquam
deest persecutio Christianis, sed neque Christo: and nunc, quod gravins est,
ipsum Christum persequuntur, qui ab eo utique Christiani dicuntur. Amici tui
Deus and proximi adversum te appropinquaverunt and steterunt. Conjurasse
videtur contra te Vniversitas populi Christiani a minimo usque ad maximum; a
planta pedis usque ad verticem, non est sanitas ulla: egressus est iniquitas a
Senioribus, Iudicibus et Vicarus tuis, qui videntur regere populu^ tuu^. Non
est jam dicere, ut populus, sic sacerdos, quia nec sic populus ut sacerdos.
Heu, heu, Domine Deus quia ipsi sunt in persecutione tua primi, qui videntur in
Ecclesia tua Primatum diligere, gerere Principatum. Arcem Syon apprehenderunt;
munitiones and universam deinceps libere and potestative tradunt incendio
Civitatem (He alludes to Pope Calixtus conquest of the Emperor, and wresting
Investitures and Ecclesiastical preferment out of his hands, under pretext of
Simony, that he and his successors might bestow them gratis on the best
deserving Clergymen; but it fell out quite contrary, as his next words import)
Misera eorum conversatio plebis tuae miserabilis subversio est, atque utinam
hac part sola nocerent. Esset forte qui Dominica praemonitus and praemunitus
exhortatione, daret operam ipsorum non exempla imitari, sed observare
praecepta, Mat. 24.
juxta illud; Quae dicunt facite, and ad opera eorum nolite respicere. Nunc
autem dati sunt sacri Gradus in occasionem turpis lucri, et quaestum aestimant
pietatem. Copiosissimae si quidem pietatis inveniuntur in suscipienda, immo
accipienda magis animarum Cura, sed haec apud eos cura minor, et de animarum
salute novissima cogitatio est; An vero Salvatori animarum gravior ulla esse
poterat persecutio? Inique agunt and caeteri contra Christum; multique sunt
nostris temporidus Antichristi. Meri^o tamea and crudeliorem eam censct
persecutionem, pro acceptis beneficiis, and graviorem sentit pro potestate quam
propriis sustinet a Ministris: licet alii quoque multi contra proximorum
salutem multipharie multisque modis and variis occasionibus agere videantur:
Agnoscite dilectissimi and expavescite consortia eorum qui suggestione maligna,
exemplo pernicioso, scandali occasion salutem impediunt animarum. Horrendum
penitus This is the (...) Sacrilege, which the Popes, Bishops, Priests were
most guilty of;
Sacrilegium, quod and ipsorum videtur excedere facinus quo Domino Majestatis
manus Sacrilegos injecerunt. Haec videt Christus, and silet: Haec Salvator
patitur, and dissimulat. Proptere^ dissimulemus nos quoque necesse est and
sileamus interim, maximeque de Praelatis nostris magistris Ecclesiarum. Sic
nimirum, sic placet, et impiis ut evadant nunc humana judicia, veniatque semel
ejudicium grave his qui praesunt, et potentes patiantur tormenta potenter.

How corrupt, unjust, and dishonorable this Pope Honorius and the Court of
Rome were in their proceedings, St. Bernard thus informed both himself and the
world in several of his Epistles to him and Haimericus Chancellor of the Roman
See. Epistola 46.
Summo Pontifici Honorio, pauperum Christi Abbates, Hugo de Pontiniaco, and
Bernardus de Claravalle, quicquid potest peccatorum oration. Lachrymabilem
Episcoporum, imo totius Ecclesiae querimoniam, nos quoque ejus filii, si tamen
digni, dissimulare non possumus. Quae vidimus, loquimur: magna siquidem nos
necessitas de claustris ad publicum traxit, ubi and quod loquimur vidimus.
Tristes vidimus, tristes eloquimur; honorem Ecclesiae Honorii tempore non
minime laesum. Jam Regis flexerat iram humilitas, vel potius constantia
Episcoporum, cum ecce a Summo Pontifice summa superveniens auctoritas, heu
dejecit constantiam, superbiam statuit. Scimus quidem id vobis per mendacium
fuisse surreptum, quod ex vestris literis palam datur adverti, ut everti tam
justum, tamque necessarium interdictum juberetis. Sed nunquid non vel tandem
deprehenso mendacio, mentitum se sentiret iniquitas sibi, and non tantae utique
Majestati? Est autem quod miramur; qua nam ratione judicatum sit de part,
abjudicatum absenti. Quod tamen non temeraria praesumptione reprehendimus, sed
filiali amore, paterno cordi suggerimus, quantum ex hoc et superbit impius, et
incenditur pauper. Caeterum quamdiu illum pati, quantumve huic compati
debeatis, non est nostrum praescribere vobis. Vos vestra hinc potius dulcissime
Pater viscera consulite, Valete. The cause of which complaint is thus related
in his next Epistle to this Pope, written Epistola 47.
ex persona Gaufridi Carnotensis; King Jews of France, for some pretended
misdemeanor, or just cause had seized the Temporalties of the Bishop of Paris,
who complaining thereof to the Archbishop of Sienna, and his Suffragans;
excepta siquidem tam modesta praedicti Episcopi querimonia, Senonensis Diocesis
universi Episcopi, una cum venerabili Metropolitano nostro, ascitis etiam
nobiscum quibusdam aliis Religiosis personis, Regem super gravi injuria per
nosipsos humiliter, prout debuimus, convenimus, ut Episcopo, nil quidem tale
merito, su^ quae tulerat restitueret, rogavimus, nec impetravimus. Sentiens
tandem nos ad arma Ecclesiae pro Ecclesia velle confugere, (they interdicting
his Land, and threatening to excommunicate him) timuit, annuitque (se omnia
redditurum. Sed in eadem forte hora supervenientibus Literis vestris, quibus
ejus terram ab interdicto absolvi praecepistis, male in maium confortatus, quod
been promiserat minime executus est. Die tamen nominata qua id se rursum
promisit executurum, ejus nobis conspectui praesentantes, sustinuimus pacem,
and non venit, quae sivimus bona, and ecce turbatio. Hoc denique literis
vestris factam est, ut male ablata pejus teneantur, et reliqua passim indies
rapiantur, eo utique secure quo impune; illa retinentur; Soluto nempe ad
vestrum imperium Episcopi justo (ut putamus) interdicto, nostroque, quando
parabamus, and quo sperabamus pacem consequi, vestro aeque timore uspenso;
interim facti sumus opprobrium vicinis nostris. Quousque, vestrae viderit
pietatis compassio.

In Epistola 48. 51.
two other Epistles he complains how much he was slandered, misrepresented to
this Pope and his Court at Rome, yea persecuted for writing truth to them and
doing well; Etiamne pauperi and inopi veritas odium parit, and ne ipsa quidem
miseria declinare invidiam potest? Sed hoc viderint fratres vestri, qui contra
legem, maledicunt surdo; and maledictum propheticum non verentes, dicunt bonum
malum, and malum bonum: Quid in me o boni viri displicuit Paternitati vestrae?
Esa. 5
etc. Quousque durat illa sententia, 2 Timothy 3.
Omnes qui pie volunt vivere in Christo, persecutionem patiuntur? Quousque
relinquitur virga peccatoris super sortem justorum? Vtinam nuper non es^em, ubi
vidiisem adversum Ecclesiam Apostolica (proh dolor) auctoritate violentam
armari tyrannidem, quasi non satis per se insanisset. Tuns demum sensi juxta
Prophetam adhaerescere linguam meam palato meo, cum subito pondus superjectum
est nostris cervicibus, Psalm. 38.
atque irrefragabilis auctoritas literarum: Isay 26.
Obmutui and humiliatus sum, and dolor meus renovatus est, quoniam vidi repent
ad illas literas, impleri facies innocentium ignominia, et laetari amplius
impios quod male fecerint, et exultare in his rebus pessimis: Misertum est
impio, ut juxta dictum propheticum, non disceret facere justitiam; and quae in
terra sanctorum injusta gessit, ipsius terra justissimo quo tenebatur absoluta
est interdicto, etc. Non tamen me latente et tacente cessare puto murmur
Ecclesiarum, si non cesset Romana Curia pro voluntate assistentium facere
praejudicium in absentes. Valete. Which he further prosecutes Epist. 49, 50,
51, 52.

This holy zealous Abbot St. Bernard, writ, preached, declaimed more frequently
and largely against the Usurpations, Temporal, Spiritual Domination, Ambition,
Pomp, Pride, Simony, Sacrilege, Laziness, Uncleanness, Sodomy, Bribery,
Corruptions of the Popes, Prelates, Clergy, Court and Church of Rome, then

forecited Passages, (on which you may reflect) and in his Homilia 4.
Supermissus est, De Conversatione ad Clericos, parvi Sermones; Super Cantica
Sermo 10, 23, 24, 32, 33, 76, 77. Epistola 42. ad Henricum Senonensem
Archiepiscopum, Epist. 48, 51, 78, 87, 91, 125, 126, 132, 152, 164, 168, 169,

Consideratione to Pope Eugenius; in his Sermo ad Clerum in Concilio Rhemensi,
ad Pastores Sermo, in Synodo, and other his works. I shall transcribe some
Passages of his, that all the world may thereby discover the sad effects of
Popes wresting Investitures out of the Emperors and Laymens hands, to engross
the disposition of all Ecclesiastical dignities, preferments into their own and
Clergies, and their inhibiting Priests marriages produced; and what ill
Bishops, Clergymen they preferred. Sermo 10. and 77. super Can^ic^ and in
Concilio Rh^^ensi 1 Psalm. ^1. Sermon. 6, and 7. Quatuor his qu^ praesunt
necessaria.
Si reddanda est ratio de his quod quisque gessit in corpore suo: heu quid fiet
de his quae quisque gessit in corpore Christi, quod est Ecclesia; Ecclesia Dei
vobis commissa est, et dicimini Pastores, cum sitis Raptores. Et paucos habemus
heu Pastores, multos autem Excommunicatores. Et utinam sufficeret vobis lana et
lac, sititis enim sanguinem. Quatuor tamen in his qui praesunt in Ecclesia Dei
necessaria esse prae omnibus reor: videlicet ut perostium intrent, ut in
humilitate se contineant, avaritiam declinent: mundiciam tam cord quam corpore
servare studeant. Sed quid prodest si canonice eligantur (quod est per ostium
intrare) and non canonice vivant? Joh. 6.
Dixit dominus, ad duodecim, Nonne ego vos duodecim eligi, and unus ex vobis
Diabolus est? Domine Jesu cum esset electio illa in manu tua, and non haberes
aliquem contradicentem, and reclamantem tibi, Quare eligisti Diabolum
Episcopum? Cur bone Jesu non eligisti bonum, and justum, and sanctum, sicut
Petrus bonus, justus, and sanctus fuit? Vel si eligisti Diabolum, cur te jactas
eligisse? Fratres, sic facit Jesus hodie, eligens sibi multos Diabolos
Episcopos. Vbi proh dolor! reperiemus Episcopos qui post adeptam dignitatem in
humilitate se contineant? Nempe superbia eis occasio est ut ad tantam
dignitatem aspirent, ut in ovile Christi impudenter irrumpant: Psalm. 100.
cum tamen per Psalmistam Dominus dicat, Non habitabit in medio domus meae qui
facit superbiam. Jesus autem in medio est, Matthew. 18
non in angulo. Vnde ipse in Evangelio; Ubi duo, inquit, vel tres congregati
fuerint in nomine meo, in medio eorum sum. Et iterum, Jesus autem transiens per
medium illorum ibat. Luc. 4.
Et in Libro Sapientiae, In medio, inquit, Ecclesiae aperuit os ejus. Eccl. 15.
Et rursus in Evangelio dicitur; Stetit Jesus in medio Discipulorum suorum.
Luc. 24.
Ve mihi Domine Jesu si tecum ero in domo tua, and non in medio domus tuae. At
isti non sic, sunt quidam cum Jesu; sed non in medio domus ejus, quia amant and
faciunt superbiam; Parents suos extollentes, Pauperes autem negligentes, and
deprimentes. Male vivunt, Esa. 14.
et subjectos male vivere volunt. Et idcirco comparantur Apostati Angelo qui
dixii in cord suo, Ponam sedem meam ad aquilonem, etc. Tales fuerunt Scribae
and Pharisaei, Mat. 23.
contra quos ait Dominus, Vae vobis Scribae and Pharisaei qui clauditis regnum
coelorum ante homines, vos enim non intratis and intrountes non sinitis
introire. Porro Episcopi hujus temporis avaritiam quomodo declinent? Quod enim
sine miserabili gemitu dicendum non est, Christi opprobria, sputa, flagelia,
clavos, lanceam, crucem, haec omnia furnace avaritiae conflant, et profligant
in acquisitionem turpis quaestus, et precium Vniversitatis suis marsupiis
includere festinant, hoc solo sane a Juda Ischariote differentes, quod ille
horum omne emolumentum denariorum numero compensavit: isti voraciori ingluvie
lucrorum infinitas exigunt pecunias. His insatiabili desiderio inhiant, pro his
ne amittant, timent; and cum amit: unt dolent. Haru^ in amore quantum quiescunt
duntaxat lib rum est eis arbitriu^ acervandi vel augmentandi, cura. Animarum
nec casus reputatur, nec salus: non sunt profecto matres, qui cum sint de
curcifixi Patrimonio nimium incrassati, impinguati, dilatati, non compatiuntur
super contritione Joseph. Archipresbyter circuit obedientiam sibi creditam and
ut impleat saccum suum, tradit sanguinem justum. Vendit nempe homicidia,
adulteria, incestus, fornicationes, sacrilegia, perjuria, et usque ad summum
implet manticam suam. Fama igitur volante innotescit Episcopo, talis quaestus,
and accersito Archipresbytero, Da mihi (inqit) partem meam. At illi nihil dabo
tibi: e contra Episcopus; si non dederis mihi (inquit) partem meam, auferam
tibi omnia. Fitque altercatio maxima, and propter dvaritiam fit discordia,
Postea vero Archipresbyter revolvens secum, quod Authoritate Episcopi fungatur
potestate ista; and quod sine gratia ipsius nihil possit (perverse conversus)
poenitet inquit me, accipe partem tuam, Luc. 2^.
and insuper de mea quod beneplacitum fuerit, and reconcilantur. Heu sicut
Herodes and Pilatus reconciliati sunt; et Christus crucifixus est: sic
nihilominus isti reconciliantur; and pauperes Christi spoliati sunt. En tempora
ista plane foeda a negotio perambulante in tenebris: Quapropter Vae generationi
huic a fermento Pharisaeorum, quod est Hypocrisis: si tamen hypocrisis dici
debet, quae jam latere prae abundantia non valet, and prae impudentia non
querit. Et sic serpit hodie putrida tabes per omne corpus Ecclesiae, quo
latius, eo desperatius: eoque periculosius quo intestinius. Nam si insurgeret
apertus Haereticus, mitteretur for as and aresceret; si violentus inimicus,
absconderet se quis for sitan ab eo. Nunc quomodo ejiciet, aut quomodo
abscondet se? Omnes amici and Inimiciomnes necessarii, omnes domestici and
nulli pacifici. Et quae sua sunt quaerunt omnes. Phil. 2. 21.
Ministri Christi sunt, et serviunt Antichristo; honorati incedunt de bonis
Domini, cut honorem non deferunt. Unde hic est eis quem quotidie videmus
meritricius nitor, Histrionicus habitus, regius apparatus. Inde aurum in
froenis, aurum in sellis, and in calcaribus: plus nitent calcaria quam altaria.
Psalm. 143.
Inde mensae splendidae, and Cibis and Cyphis; Inde commessationes and
ebrietates, Inde Cithara and lyra and tibia: redundantia torcularia, and
promptuaria plena, erustantia ex hoc in illud. Inde dolia pigmentaria, inde
referta marsupia. Hujusmodi sunt et volunt esse, Ecclesiarum Praepositi,
Decani, Episcopi, et Archiepiscopi. Nec enim haec merito cedunt, sed negotio
illi, quod perambulat in tenebris. Olim praedictum est, Esa 21.
and nunc tempus impletionis advenit, Ecce in pace amaritudo mea amarissima.
Amara prius in nece Martyrum, amarior post in conflictu Haereticorum,
amarissima nunc in moribus Domesticorum. Non fugari, non exterminari possunt,
ita invaluorunt, Esa. 21.
ita multiplicati sunt super numerum. Intestina, and insanabilis enim plaga
Ecclesiae, Psalm. 39.
and ideo in pace amaritudo mea amarissima. Sed in qua pace? Pax est, and non
est Pax: Isa. 1^
Pax a Paganis, Pax ab Haereticis, sed non profecto a filiis. Vox plangentis in
tempore Israel, Job 40.
Filios enutrivi and exaltavi, ipsi aut spreverunt me. Spreverunt et
invaluerunt a turpi vita, a turpi quaestu, a turpi commercio, a negotio
perambulante in tenebris: Superest ut jam de medio fiat demonium meridianum ad
seducendos si qui in Christo residui sunt, adhuc persistentes in simplicitate
sua, siquidem absorbuit fluvios sapientum, and torrentes potentum, Et habet
fiduciam quod influat Jordanis in os ejus, i. humiles and simplices qui sunt in
Ecclesia, Ipse enim est Antichristus, 2 Thessalonians. 2.
qui non solum se diem, sed and meridiem mentitur, and extollitur supra id quod
colitur, ut Deus, quem dominus Jesus interficiet Spiritu oris sui, and destruet
illum illustratione adventus sui. Ecce diximus quales habemus Pastores in via
hac qua ambulamus, non quales habere opus. Non sunt omnes amici sponsi, qui
hodie sponsi sunt Ecclesiae. Hinc inde assist^re cernuntur, Phil. 2.
and vulgo aiunt eam quasi addrextrare videntur. Pauci admodum sunt qui quae
sua sunt, non quaerunt, ex omnibus Charis ejus. Diligunt munera, nec possunt
pariter diligere Christum, quia manus dederunt Mammonae, Intuere quommodo
incedunt, nitidi and ornati, circumamicti varietate tanquam sponsa procedens de
thalamo suo. Nonne si quempiam talium repent eminus procedentem assexeris,
sponsam potius putabis quam sponsae custodem? Unde vero hanc illis, exuberare
aestimes rerum affluentiam, vestium splendorem, mensarum luxuriam, congeriem
vasorum argenteorum and aureorum, nisi de bonis sponsi? Inter haec est quod
illa pauper, et inops, et nuda relinquitur facie miseranda, inculta, hispida et
exanguis: propter hoc non est hoc tempore ornare sponsam, sed spoliare; non est
custodire, sed perdere; non est defendere, sed exponere; Psalm 5^.
non est instruere, sed prostituere; non est pascere gregem Domini, Psalm 78.
sed mactare, et devorare; dicente Domino de illis, qui devorant plebem meam ut
cibum panis: Ose 4.
and iterum, quia commederunt Jacob and locum ejus desolverunt, peccata populi
commedent, quasi dicat; peccatorum precia exigunt, et peccantibus
sollicitudinem non impendunt. Quem dabis mihi de numero Episcoporum, qui non
plus invigilet subditorum evacuandis marsupiis, quam vitiis extipandis? Vbi est
qui flectat iram? Vbi est qui praedicet annum placabilem domino? Propterea
restnquamus istos, qui non sunt Pastores sed Traditores, et imitemur illos qui
viventes in Carne, plantaverunt Ecclesiam sanguine suo. Et quidem isti sortiti
sunt Ministerii locum, sed non Zelum; successores omnes cupiunt esse,
imitatores pauci; utinam tam vigiles reperirentur ad Curam, quam alacres
currunt ad Cathedram; vigilarent utique solicit servantes sibi creditam
Ecclesiam. Immo vero vigilarent pro semetipsis nec sinerent de se dici, amici
mei and proximi mei adversum me appropinquaverunt and steterunt. Iusta omnino
querimonia, nec ad ullum justius quam ad nostram referenda aetatem; Parum est
nostris Pastoribus quod non servant nos, nisi et perdant: Graviter quippe
dimersi oblivionis somnio ad nullum dominicae comminationis tonitruum
expergiscuntur, ut vel suum ipsorum periculum expavescant: inde est quod non
parcant suis, qui non parcunt sibi: perimentes pariter and pereuntes. After
which he relates their unclean, Sodomitical practices, which I Here, p. 290,
291, 292, 293.
formerly touched, and shall not here repeat.

In another place he thus complains of the ambition, avarice, depravation of
the Clergy, and Court of Rome in that age. Epistola. 42.
Nunc vero quia sola attenditur gloria, and non poena, purum esse clericum
erubescitur in Ecclesia, seque viles aestimant and inglorii, qui quocunque
eminentiori in loco non fuerint sublimati: Scholares pueri, and impuberes
adolescentuli ob sanguinis dignitatem, and de sub ferula transferuntur ad
principandum Presbyteris, laetiores interim quod virgas evaserint, quam quod
meruerint principatum, nec tam illis blanditur adeptum, quam ademptum
Magisterium: Et hoc quidem in initio. Processu vero temporis paulatim
insolescentes, docti sunt in brevi vendicare altaria, subditorum marsupia
vacuare, Magistris nimirum in hac disciplina utentes idoncis, ambitione et
avaritia. Verum quantavis industria tua tibi lucra conquirere cautulus
videaris, quantalibet vigilantia rem possis servaretuam, quantecunque studio
Regum tibi ac Pincipum gratiam captare cures, Ecci. 10.
dicimus tamen, Vae terrae cujus Rex est puer, and cujus Principes mane
comedunt: Caeterum curritur in Clero, passim ab omni aetate and ordine, a
doctis pariter and indectis, ad Ecclesiasticas Curas, tanquam sine curis jam
quisque victurus sit, cum ad curas pervenerit. Nec mirum de his qui necdum in
semetipsis experti sunt. Videntes quippe illos qui jam proprios humeros cupitae
sarcinae summiserunt, non solum non gemere tanquam sub onere, sed insuper
appetere plus onerari, non deterrentur periculis, qui cupiditate caecati non
vid^nt, sed favoribus amplius quos illis invident provocantur. O Infinita
semper Ambitio, et insatiabilis avaritia! Cum primos honorum gradus meruerint
in Ecclesia, meruerint, autem vel vitae merito vel pecunicae, sive etiam carnis
et sangunis, quae regnum Dei non possidebunt, praerogativa, non ideo Corda
quiescunt, duplici semper aestuantia desiderio, quo utique magis ac magis et
dilatentur Is not this their Genius, Practice ever since, and now?
in plura, et ad celsiora sublimentur. Verbi gratia, cum factus quis fuerit in
quacunque Ecclesia Decanus, Praepositus, Archidiaconus, aut aliquid hujusmodi,
non contentus uno in una, plures sibi immo quotquot valet conquirere honores
satagit, tam in una quam in pluribus. Quibus tamen omnibus si locus evenerit,
libenter unius praeferet Episcopi dignitatem; Sed nunquid sic satiabitur?
Factus Episcopus, Archiepiscopus esse desiderat. Quo forte adepto, rursum
nescio quid altius somnians, laboriosis itineribus, et sumptuosis
familiaritatibus Romanum statuit frequentare palatium, questuosas sibi quasdam
exinde comparans amicitias. Si Lucri Spiritualis gratia haec faciunt, laudandus
est zelus, sed praesumptio corrigenda. Nonnulli cum ista non possint, vertunt
se ad aliud ambiendi genus, in quo nihilominus aperiunt eam quam habent
dominaudi libidinem. Nam cum praesident Vrbibus valde populosis, and totas, ut
ita dicam patrias propriae Diocasis ambitu cincumcludunt, occasion inventa, ex
quocunque veteri privilegio, satis agunt, ut et vicinas sibi subjiciant.
Civitates, quatenus duae, quibus duo vix praesules sufficiebant, sub uno
redigantur Antistite. Regi quae haec tam odiosa praesumptio? Quis hic tantus
ardor dominandi super terram? quae principandi, tam effrenis cupiditas? Certe
cum primum tractus es ad Cathedram, flebas, refugiebas, vim querebaris: multum
ad te, and omnino supra te esse dicens, miserum clamitans and indignum, qui non
esse idoneus tam Sancto Ministerio, tantis non sufficeres curis: Quid igitur
nunc verecunda depulsa formidine, sponte ambis ad ampliora, immo irreverenti
audacia, propriis non contentus invadis aliena? Cur hoc? Forte ut plures
populos salves? Sed in alienam messem tuam mittere falcem injuriosum est. Vt
tuae praestes Ecclesiae? Sed Ecclesiarum sponso non placet tale unius
incrementum quod sit detrimentum alterius. Crudelis ambitio, and incredibilis,
si fidem oculi non astruerent: Vix tenent manus quin illud ad literam impleant,
quod logitur in Propheta, Secuerunt pregnantes Galaad, Esai. 5.
ad dilatandum terminos suos. Vbi est illa terrifica comminatio, Vae qui
conjungitis domum ad domum, and agrum agro copulatis: Nunquid in his duntaxat
exiguis, vae istud metuendum est, non autem cum Vrbes Vrbibus, aut Provinciae
Provinciis continuantur? Immo, etiam respondeant si imitari Dominum Christum;
facientes and ipsi utraque unum adducentes, and ipsi ex diversis pascuis
greges, Ephesians. 2.

non quod valde Romani curent, quo fine res terminetur; sed quia valde diligunt
munera, sequuntur retributiones. Nude nuda loquor, nec retego verecunda, sed
inverecunda confuto. Utinam privatim and in Cameris haec sierent, Utinam soli
viderimus and audierin us, Utinam nec loquentibus crederetur, Utinam nobis
reliquerint moderni Noae unde a Nobis possent aliquaetenus operiri. Nunc vero
cernente Orb mundi fabulam soli tacebimus?

He elsewhere thus seconds this complaint, In Psalm. 91. Sermo 6.
Ipsa quoque Ecclesiasticae dignitatis officia in turpem quaestum and
tenebrarum negotium transiere, nec in his salus animarum, sed luxus qua ritur
divitnarum. Propter hoc tondentur, propter hoc frequentant Ecclesias, Missas
celebrant, Psalmos decantant. Pro Episcopatibus et Archidiaconatibus et
Abbatiis, aliisque dignitatibus hodie impudenter decertatur, ut Ecclesiarum
redditus in superfluitatis et vanitatis usus dissipentur. ^perest ut reveletur
homo peccati, filius perditionis, daemonium non modo diurnum sed and
meridianum; quod non solum transfiguretur in Angelorum lucis, 2 Thessalonians. 2.
sed extollitur super omne quod dicitur Deus, aut quod colitur. Nimirum
insidiatur crudelius calcaneo matris Ecclesiae, a qua dolet caput suum esse
contritum. Hic plane gravissimus erit incursus, sed ob hoc quoque Ecclesiam
Electorum veritas liberabit propter eos brevians dies. Epistola 42. ad Henricum
Senonensem Archiepiscopum ^ Tim. 2.
Cernitur in nonnullis Sacerdotibus vestium cultus plurimus, virtutum aut
nullus, aut exiguus. Quibus ego si rememorarem illud Apostolicum, non in vest
preciosa, vereor ne indignentur: dum nimirum indignum ducant in se assu^^ptam
sententiam, quam prius in viliorem sexum and ordinem prolata fuisse,
recognoverint, Quasi vero non eodem utantur medici ferro secandis regibus quo
and popularibus hominibus, aut capiti fiat injuria, si ipsis forcipibus capilli
excrescentes detondeantur, quibus and unguium fuer intresecata superflua.
Attamen si dedignantur pari cum mulierculis, non quidem a me, sed ab Apostolo
feriri sententia; dedignentur and cum ipsis eadem involvi culpa. Despiciant jam
textricum sive pellificum, and non propriis operibus gloriari. Horreant et
murium rubricatas pelliculas, quas gulas vocant, manibus circundare sacratis,
and sacrantibus tremenda mysteria. Respuant and apponere pectori quod decentius
ornat gemma sapientiae, Pudeat and Collo circumtexere quod honestius atque
suavius Christi jugo submittitur: Non Christi stigmata sunt haec, quae isti
Martyrum exemplo circumferant in corpore suo. Muliebria potius esse noscuntur
insignia: quae utique curiosius, and sumptuosius ille sibi praeparare
consueverunt, cogitantes nimirum, quae sunt mundi, quomodo placeant viris.
Verum tu Sacerdos Dei altissimi, cui ex his placere gestis, mundo, an Deo? Si
mundo, cur Sacerdos? Si Deo, cur qualis populus talis et Sacerdos? Nam si
placere vis mundo, quid tibi prodest Sacerdotium? Mat. 6. 24.

hominibus, Deo non places. Sinon places, non placas. Cur ergo, ut dixi,

populus and Sacerdos? Enimvero si Sacerdos Pastor est, and populus Oves dignum
est ut in nullo appareat Ovibus Pastor dissimilis, si instar mei qui ovis sum,

juvenes and nobiles: adjutores esse deberent, et utinam non adversarentur. Sed
supersedeo: Dico tamen Ius, fas, honestas, religio in nostris Episcopatibus
perierunt; to wit, among the Bishops and Clergy, of whom he thus complained to
the Pope, without any hopes of redress. I pretermit his See Epist. 158, 164,

After the death of Pope Honorius (to whom St. Bernard writ several Epist. 13,
14, 46, 47, 49, 50.
Epistles) Anno Dom. 1130. there arose a Great Schism in the Church about the
election of a New Pope; some of the Cardinals electing Gregory Cardinal of St.
Angelo, who assumed the name of Innocent the 2. against the Romans consents:
who presently taking up arms against Rogerius Duke of Sicily and Normandy
(stiling Sigeberti Continuator Otto Frisingensis, l. 7. c. 27 28. Chronicon

himself King of Sicily) to suppress him, was together with his Cardinals
taken and detained Prisoner by him, till he granted him all his demands, except
only the Title of King of Sicily: In the mean time the Romans chose the son
of Peter Leo Pope, and sti^ed him Anacletus. He to establish himself in St.
Peter's Chair, seized upon the gold or silver Crowns, Crosses, Crucifixes,
Vessels, Ornaments of the Church, and melting them into coin distributed the
money among the Romans, whereby he so obliged them to him, that Innocent after
his release out of prison, thought it not safe to stay at Rome, but taking ship
with his Cardinals passed over to Pisa, and there excommunicated Anacletus.
From thence sending a Legate to Ludovicus Crassus King of France, to relate the
equity of his cause, desired he might be there received as Pope; the French
Bishops being doubtful, to which of these Popes they should adhere, some of
them siding with Anacletus against Innocent; thereupon a Council was held at
Stamps, where (by St. Bernards means, who stickled for Innocent, and writ many
Bernardi Epist. 124, to 133, 139, 140, 150, ^76. Bernardi Vita l. 2. c. 1, 2.
Epistles to Kings, Princes, Bishops in his behalf) Innocent was received as
Pope. After which he posted into Germany to Lotharius, where a Council of
Bishops was called at Leodium, which received him as Pope; engaging Lotharius
the Emperor by Oath to restore him, if he would crown him Emperor. After which
returning into France, having by St. Bernards Epistles, travel, mediation,
engaged the Kings of Germany, England, Scotland, Spain, Jerusalem, to receive
him as lawful Pope, he held several Councils at Rhemes, Placentia, Pisa, and
Claremount, wherein he Cent. Magd. 12. col. 1032.
solemnly excommunicated, anathematized Anacletus and all his adherents with
horrible execrations.

St. Bernard in his 125. Epistle renders this account of these two Popes
elections and proceedings, ad Magistrum Galfridum de Loratorio; Tu tibi
quiescis, and matter tua Ecclesia graviter conturbatur: habuit sua tempora
quies, and sanctum otium hactenus sua negotia licenter, libenterque exercuit:

Altera quoque bestia penes vos subsibilat, sicut catulus in ^bditis. Illa
ferocior, ista callidor pariter convenerunt in unum adversus Dominum and

est, nimirum eligentium and numero vincens, and merito. At tu frater quid adhuc
negligis? quousque vicino serpenti tua male secura dormitat industria. Scimus
quidem te filium pacis nulla posse ratione induci deserere unitatem; sed
profecto non sufficit, nisi and defensare, atque ipsius quoque turbatores totis
viribus debellare studueris. Nec quietis timeas detrimentum, quod non parvo
tuae gloriae incremento compensabitur, si fera illa vicina vobis tuo studio
mansuescat, vel obmutescat, and tantam Ecclesiae praedam (Comitem dico
Pictaviensem) in man tua Dei pietas de ore Leonis eripiat. In his Epistola 124.

expressions: Quidam juxta Esaiam vidi foedus percussisse cum morte, Lu. 2.

positus est in ruinam and in resurrectionem multorum: Nam qui Dei sunt libenter
junguntur ei; qui autem ex adverso stat, aut Antichristi est, aut Antichristus:
Cernitur abominatio stare in loco sancto, quam ut obtineat incendit igni

Epist. 176
Fugit ille nimiram a facie Leonis: sicut dicit Propheta, Leo rugiet, Amos. 3.

fugite in aliam. Fugit and in hoc vere virum se Apostolicum probans: quod

His Epistola 239.
Epistle ad Lotharium Imperatorem, in this Popes behalf, is very observable;
Lothario Dei Gratia Romano Imperatori Augusto, B. Abbas Claravallae, si quid
potest peccatoris oration. Benedictus Deus qui vos elegit, et erexit cornu
salutis nobis, ad laudem et gloriam nominis sui, et reparandum Imperii decus:
ad subveniendum Ecclesiae suae in tempore malo: postremo ad operandum etiam
nunc salutem in medio terrae. Ipsius est enim opus quod Corona Gloriae vestrae
ita indies ampliatur, and sublimatur, mirabiliter crescens ac proficiens in
omni decore, and magnificentia apud Deum and homines. Ipsius profecto nuper
opus and virtus fuit, quod iter satis laboriosum and meticulosum pro pace
Regni, and Ecclesiae liberatione susceptum in tanta prosperitate peregistis.
Romae siquidem Imperialis culminis plenitudinem gloriosissime assecutus. Idque
quod majus fuit in manu non magna, ut animi fideique magnitudo clarius
emineret. Quod si ante tantillum exercicum terra tremit and quievit: quantus
patamus horror hostium corda invadere habeat, cum coeperit Rex procedere in
magnitudine brachii sui? Animabit insuper honestas causae, immo duplex
provocabit necessitas. Non est meum hortari ad pugnam, est tamen (securus dico)
advocati Ecclesiae, ab Ecclesiae infestatione schismaticorum rabiem, est
Caesaris proprium vendicare Coronam ab usurpatore Siculo. Vt enim constat
Iudaicam sobolem sedem Petri in Christi occupasse injuriam; sic proculdubio
omnis qui in Sicilia Regem se facit, contradicit Caesari. Si autem utrumque
incumbit Caesari, restituere scilicet Caesari quae sunt Caesaris, and quae sunt
Dei Deo; (Therefore by St. Bernards Verdict, Siciliy is the Emperors, not St.
Peter's or the Popes Patrimony.) Cur apud Tullum res Dei minuitur, cum Caesar
nihil ibi lucretur? Verendum est ne minimorum neglectus, impedimentum sit
maximorum. Hoc est quod dico, Ecclesia Sancti Gegulfi graviter injusteque (ut
dicitur) in illa Civitate opprimitur, and aiunt vestrae prudentiae nescio qua
fraud subreptum, ut Domino Papae per justitiam subvenire paranti vestrae
interventu precis obviaretis, obsecro and consulo consultius agi, noxiam
revocari precem; dari locum justitiae, antequam Ecclesia illa funditus
destruatur. Pauper sum ego, fidelis tamen vester. Et si video Importunus,

large to Posterity by Carolus Sigonius, more exactly than by any other
Historian.

Mortuo Honorio postridie Cardinales cum Clero convenerunt, ac relatione de
novo substituendo Pontifice facta, alii alio sua studia contulerunt. Major
pars, eaque integrior, Gregorium Johannis Vidonis filium ex Canonico regulari
Cardinalem, vitae, aetatis, ut prudentiae gravitate, illo honor dignissimum
legit, eumque Innocentium secundum vocavit; minor eaque corruptior Petrum,
Petri Leonis filium, ex Clerico Cardinalem, omnibus his laudibus omnium judicio
inferiorem renunciavit, ac Superioribus fustra renitentibus, festinanter atque
astute consecratum, Anacleti secundi nomine insignivit. Innocentius per
Ostioensem Episcopum legitime consecratus ac moderate a suis per omnia loca, in
quibus ex antiquo instituto Sessiones ipsi habent Pontifices, circumductus,
demum, legitimam Lateram sedem inivit. Uterque Civis Romanus erat; verum
Nobilitas in Petro major and spes pramiorum uberior, multo plures ad eum
venerandum illexit. Itaque Petri sive Anacleti part in urbe fuerente, atque
Innocentio, and fautoribus ejus terrorem ac periculum intentante, Innocentius
timuit, atque una cum Cardinalibus suis ad Fragipanes amicos accestit, homines
tum in urbe insigni potentia ac nobilitate florentes, and in eorum turribus
salutem tueri suam contendit. Anacletus ad pecumam, quam ex Patrimonii
magnitudine, and negotiis Domini Ecclesiae gestis coacervatam habebat, simul
etiam quoque nefarie comparavit; Nota
Siquidem occupata Vaticana D. Petri Basilica coronas, calices and crucifixos
aureos, ac ciborium, quod Leo construxerat, sustulit, itemque alia opulenta
urbis Tempia donariis pretiosissimis spoliavit, atque auro conflato ingentem in
pecuniae summam redegit, quam cum plebi distribuisset, facile quod reliquum
populi erat, ab Innocentio avocavit. Itaque Populus Romanus pravis illebris
Anacleti corruptus, Innocentium ac Cardinales partemque ejus non solum probris
and convitiis petere, sed etiam manu, telisque incessere institit. Quibus malis
cum resistere se non posse Innocentius cerneret, sibi urbe cedendum
existimavit, ac relicto in Laterano Conrado Sabinensi Episcopo, paratis occulte
navigiis secundo Tiberi cum Cardinalibus suis ad mare, atque inde duabus
Pisanorum triremibus Pisas accessit. Exceptus a Pisanis tantis studiis, quantis
verum excipi Pontificem decuit. Ibi proximorum Episcoporum conventu habito
Anacletum partemque ejus devovit, atque Henricum Patriarcham Gradensem
designatum consecravit, ac pallio insignivit. Interim Legati ab eo in Franciam
missi Ludovicum Regem, ac populos Francorum de jusstis ipsius Comitiis
docuerunt, eosque ad complectendum Innocentium adhortati sunt. Haerente autem
consilio, Ludovicus, and Episcopi, Concilium Stampis habuere, atque eo
praecipue Bernardum Abbatem Cluravallensem maxim tunc propter creditam
sanctitatem authoritatis hominem accivere. Ibi utriusque Pontificis comitia
accuratissime sunt discussa. Bernardo vero Innocentii causam graviter ac
copiose agente, haud aegre and Rex, and Episcopi omnes Innocentio subscripsere,
ac missis ad Innocentium nunciis ipsum in Franciam vocavere. Ita Innocentius
rebus satis in Etruria constitutis, gratiis Pisanis actis Franciam versus
accessit. Ex itinere cum Genuam attigisset a Civitate honorifice exceptus Syrum
Novum urbis Episcopum consecravit, atque inter eos and Pisanos inducias usque
ad suam reversionem composuit. Profectus inde Genua ad littus Provinciae
accessit, and per Decembrem mensem alterum Claramonte conventum habuit, atque
iterum Anacletum et fautores ejus damnavit. Dum haec ab Innocenti
administrantur, Anacletus, qui solus in urbe remanserat, et ipse partem
adversam infligendis Anathematis institit premere, et ad causam suam amicos
quam plurimos potuit aggregare. Praecipue autem Anselmus Mediolonensis
Archiepiscopus, ab Honorio Conradi causa devotus, ei se tradidit, atque una
secum populum Mediolanensem, ac plerosque Lombardiae Episcopos traxit. Quin
etiam Rogerius Siciliae Comes, atque Apuliae and Calubriae, cum Roberto
Principe Capuano ad Innocentium Pisas profecto, per arma Principatum eripuisset
omnes ditionis suae Proceres ad Anacletum traduxit. Ejus vero facti haec ratio
fuit. Rogerius cum Sicilia, Calabria, Apuleaque potitus, se opibus ad tuendam
regiae Majestatis titulum satis instructum videret, nec tam late patentem
potentiam, exiguitate nominis coarctandam existimaret, ultro se Regem Siciliae
nuper appellare nulla Pontificia authoritate inceperat. Quod cum vulgo
improbari sentiret, occasionem idoneam nactus ad Anacletum accessit, and se cum
suis Episcopis complexurum, si se Regem appellaret, ostendit. Anacletus
optatissimam occasionem adeptus, avide arripuit, ac re composita, Beneventum
profectus 5. Calendas October. ipsum praesentem Siliciae Regem, Apuliae,

ita populis, perlustrare. Itaque praesente Ludovico 14 Kalend. Novembris
Concilium Remis frequentissimum habuit in quo Anacletum deintegro condemnavit,
ac Ludovicum juvenem Ludovici filium, Anno 2132,
Regia Franciae Corona 7 Kalendas ornavit. Sequenti Anno Innocentius Leodium
prodiit. Atque eodem quoque Lotharius cum omnibus Sacris, and profanis Regni
sui proceribus, and universa Germaniae nobilitate occurrit. Ibi Innocentius a
Rege, caeterisque eximii cultus Conventum celeberrimum habuit; in quo sacras
adversus Anacletum detestationes redintegravit, ac Lotharium ad se Ecclesiamque
tuendam honesto Othonis Magni, and posterorum ejus exemplo hortatus est.
Lotharius se nullo ei tempore defuturum respondit, si ipse sibi antiquum jus
conferendorum sacerdotiorum, cui nuper Henricus renunciarat, concederet; Nam
Imperium plurimum eo vectigali subtracto ad gravia pro Ecclesia sustinenda
bella detrimenti caepisse. Qua voce audita graviter perculsi Cardinalium animi
sunt, ut qui se tristiorem in Germania ipsis Ecclesiae rebus fortunam reperisse
viderentur, quam Romae reliquissent, si eo sibi jure cedendum esset, quod ipsi
nuper tanto sudore ac sanguine vix tandem Ecclesiae peperissent. Tum Bernardus
qui ab Innocentii latere nunquam discessit, Petitionem ejus iniquam, atque
alienam esse docere, neque ipsum petisse sed Was not this true of the Popes
Predecessors, who had wrested it from the Emperors by force?
extorsisse tempore iniquioris fortunae captato, judicaturos homines esse
oportere eum, ut genere, sic studio a Gebellinis differ, qui pravum exemplum
ut vendendorum sacerdotiorum, sic oppugnandae Ecclesiae induxissent, eundem
omnem dissidii inter Imperium, atque Ecclesiam tollere occasionem debere, ne
diuturna concertandi consuetudo Christianorum in duas factiones studia
distrahat. Quod si quando eveniat profecto non sine ingenti pernicie omnium
eventurum. Haec ipsa non aliter atque si ex oraculo edita essent, facile
prudentem piumque Regem de sententia deturbarunt, pollicitusque est, se
Innocentium Romam cum exercitu reducturum, atque Anacleto exacto incolumem in
Laterano collocaturum, si ipse sibi Imperatorium diadema sponderet. Quod cum
Innocentius promisisset, and rei perficiendae consilium satis, ut in
praesentia, constitisset, Leodio abiit; ac Monasterio Bernardi Claravallae
lustrato sese in Italiam retulit, ac Genuam reversus ibi Lotharii adventum sibi
expectandum esse constituit. Eodem Anno Mediolanenses (in defense of Anacletus
his title against Innocent) iterum adversus Papienses moverunt, ac Praelio
magno ad Martinengum facto eos ita fuderunt, ut prope ad internecionem
afflixerint. Agro inde rursus long lateque vastato, domum est reditum.
Imolenses castri Sancti Cassiani, quod ex Diaecesi sua cum Bononiensibus
sentiebat, iruerunt. Erat tum in Germania Conradus ex Italia nuper post varios
excitatos tumultus reversus. Is licet magna pecunia rerumque omnium
difficultate oppressus, tamen partium studio multos adhuc causae suae studiosos
habebat. Ea res fecit, ut manentibus adhuc seditionibus Lotharius exercitum
conficere haud magnum potuerit. Cum iis igitur quas parare potuit, copiis
sequenti anno in Italiam per vallem Tridentinam, Othone and Sigeberto
authoribus, transiit, atque a Bononiensibus, and Aemiliensibus cum Conradi
studio, tum copiarum exiguitate contemptus, recta ad Appenninum accessit, ac
Pisas ad sumendum Innocentium properavit. Caeterum Innocentius a Genuensibus
comiter and honorifice jam bis acceptus, hanc eis gratiam retulit, quod
Episcopum eorum, obedientia Archiepiscopi Mediolanensis exemptum Archiepiscopum
fecit, atque ei dimidiam Episcoporum Corsicae partem subjecit. Syrus primus ea
dignitate est usus. Genua inde Placentiam terrestri itinere profectus novo
Anacletum, and fautores ejus concilo jugulavit. Via inde Aemilia ingressus 17
Calendar Junias Bononiam venit, mox superato Apennino Pisas progressus, pacem
inter Pisanos and Genuenses composuit, eorumque Ecclesiam perinde ac Genuensem
Metropolitanam effecit; part altera Episcoporum Corsicae, contributa, quae res
adhuc discordiam inter eas Civitates aluerat. Haec vero illo, cum ad vetera
earum Civitatum erga se beneficia persolvenda, tum ad nova duris his temporibus
provocanda studiose agente, Lotharius supervenit, atque ipso ut dixi assumpto
Viterbiam, atque inde Romam perrexit. Ibi castris ad portam S. Agnetis locatis,
Genuenses and Pisanos Classes suas littoribus admovere Romany jussit, ac,
tantum Anacleto, and fautoribus ejus qui Urbem tenebant, terroris injecit, ut
in editas se turres salutis suae tuendae causa referrent. Qua re animadversa ab
amicis receptus, ipse cum Innocentio Urbem pacato agmine in^it: cumque illum in
Laterano reposuisset, ipse Aventinum insedit. Rebus in hunc modum habentibus
duo inde sibi expedienda putavit, unum, ut praesentem controversiam cum
Anacleto aliqua ratione finiret; alteram, ut Coronam ab Innocentio Augustalem
acciperet. Ubi vero se dissidium tollere non posse sensit, quod Anacletus ad id
neque Colloquii neque Praelii facere Copiam vellet, omne studium ad insignia
recipienda convertit. Huic rei cum illud obstaret, quod Anacletus basilicam
Vaticanam operibus, praesidioque firmatam tenebat, in qua moris fuerat Diadema
Imperatorium tradi, Innocentius, ne qua ei solemni mora injiceretur, Lotharium
in Lateranum vocavit, atque ibi pridie Nonas Junias ipsi Coronam imposuit, ac
protenus ad prodendam rei novo exemplo actae memoriam, hujus facti seriem
regiae in pariete pingi, atque hos Versus subscribi mandavit: Rex venit ante
fores, jurans prius Vrbis honores,
Post homo fit Papae, sumit quo dante Coronam.
This Emperor Lotharius departing soon after from Rome into Germany, Eo urbe
profecto Anacleti factio e turribus exiit, ac per urbem volitans caedem amicis
Innocentii intentare, ac novo omnia tumultu permiscere instituit. Vita
Bernardi, l. 2. c. 2.
Quare Innocentius intelligens manisionem suam in urbe rationibus Ecclesiae
parum conducere, ne praesentia sua rabiem, ac furorem adversariorum accenderet,
Pisas, Civium erga se benignitatem expertus repetiit, eoque novum Concilium ex
toto Occidente indixit. Quod ubi Bernardus Claravallensis audivit Bernardi
Epistola 130.
Epistolam, quae extat, ad Pisanos scripsit, adhortans eos ut singulari studio
Pontificem cum Cardinalibus custodirent, atque honoris accepti magnitudinem
assiduitate Officii compensarent. Assumitur, inquit, Pisa in locum Therefore
the Popes Claim to Saint Peter's Chair at Rome was totally annihilated by divine
providence, and translated to Pisa.
Romae, et de cunctis urbibus terrae ad Apostolicae sedis culmen eligitur, nec

reddit illustrem, gloriosam, famosam. Alioquin si ignoras te, O pulchra inter
Civitates, ingredires post greges fidelium tuorum pascere haedos tuos. At the
same time Epistola 131.
St. Bernard writ an Epistle to the Clergy and People of Millain, (whose
Archbishop Anselmus, Innocentius had degraded, and erected two Archbishopricks
in lieu thereof, for siding with Anacletus;) informing them by his
intercession, mediation, that Pope Innocent was ready to receive them into his
favor, to confirm their new-elected Bishop Robaldus, restore their
Archbishopric to them, and send them a Pall without delay, if they would
consent and adhere to Innocent and Lotharius, and desert Anacletus. Been
vobiscum facit Deus, Been vobiscum facit Romana Ecclesia. Facit ille quod
Pater, facit illa quod Matter. Et revera quid vobis debuit facere and non fecit?
Si postulastis mitti vobis de Curia honorabiles personas ad honorem Dei and
vestrum, factum est: si postulastis confirmari quod unanimitas vestra
venerabilis Patris vestri electione firmaverat, factum est. Si voluistis
licuisse vobis quod illicitum, nisi pro magna quidem necessitate Sacri Canones
judicant, translationem Episcopi scilicet in Archiepiscopum, concessum est. Si
rogastis erui Cives vestros de Vinculis Placentinorum quod utique ego
praetermittere nec volo, nec valeo, Et hoc factum est. In quo postremo
quocunque rationabili^ petitio filiae, non dico repulsam, sed vel moram passa
est, apud p^am matrem? En ad complementum pallium praesto est, plenitudo
honoris. Nunc vero audi me inclytplebs, Gens Nobilis, Civitas gloriosa. Audi
inquam, me (veritatem dico; non mentior) dilectorem tui, zelatorem salutis
tuae. Romana Ecclesia valde clemens est, sed nihilominus potens. Fidele
Consilium, and omni acceptione dignum, noli abuti clementia, ne potentia
opprimaris. Sed dicit aliquis debitam ei reverentiam exhibebo, and nihil
amplius. Esto, fac quod dicis; quod si exhibeas debitam, and omnimodam;
Plenitudo siquidem potestatis super universas Orbis Ecclesias, singulari
Prerogativa Apostolicae Sedi donata est. Qui igitur huic potestati resistit,
Dei ordinationi resistit. And cannot the Emperor and every King do as much
without the Pope? but the Pope could not justly do this without their assent.
Potest eos qui sunt altos deprimere, alios sublimare prout ratio sibi
dictaverit, ita ut de Episcopis creare Archiepiscopos liceat, and e converso si
necesse visum fuerit. Potest a finibus terrae sublimes quascunque personas
Ecclesiasticas evocare, and cogere ad suam praesentiam non semel aut bis, sed
quotiens expedire videbit. Porro in promptu est ei omnem ulcisci inobedientiam
si quis forte reluctari conatus fuerit. Denique, probasti and tu, quid enim
contulit tibi, vetus tua rebellio, and recalcitratio male suasa a
pseudo-Propheris tuis? Quem fructum habuisti, in quibus nunc erubescis? Agnosce
potius in qua potestate, Gloria and Honor suffraganeorum tuorum tam diu
privata extitisti. Quis pro te valuit obviare Apostolicae authoritatis
justissimae severitati, cum provocata tuis excessibus; decrevit te tuis illis
antiquis ac praeclaris ornamentis nudare, mutilare membris; and hodie confusa
and truncata jaceres, si non benignius quam potentius tecum actum fuisset. Quis
eam prohibere valebit etiam a gravioribus, si rursum (quod absit) adjeceris
provocare? Vide ne patiaris recidivum quia pro certo (nisi fallor) non tam
facile denuo poterit inveniri remedium. Si quis itaque dixerit tibi, partim
oportet obedire cum in te experta sis plentitudinem Apostolicae potestatis,
authoritatis integritatem; nonne hujusmodi aut seductus, aut seducere vult? Sed
fac quod dico, nam ego te non seduco, etc.

Not long after this Epistle St. Bernard and Pope Innocents Legate repairing to
Millain, they submitted themselves to Pope Innocent and renounced Anacletus.
After which by Pope Innocents command, S. Bernard was sent to Papia and Cremona
to reconcile them by a Parley; but those of Cremona would by no means receive
him. Lotharius having pacified Germany, at the Popes Importunity, Anno 1136.
entered into Italy with two great Armies to restore Pope Innocent, Anno 1136.
expel Anacletus out of Rome, and reduce all parts of Italy adhering to him.
Having reduced Millain, Cremona and other Cities to his obedience; Henry Duke
of Bavaria the Emperors General with part of his Army conducted Innocent to
Rome: Anno 1537.
Ibi tertio nonas Maii Conventus omnium Episcoporum Abbatumque qui adesse
potuerunt est habitus, ac rursus Anacletus Rogeriusque devotus: Eo post triduum
Henricus urbe cum Innocentio egressus, Sigonius, l. 2.
Albam, quae cum Anacleto sentiebat, invasit, ac suburbiis disiectis infestum
inde in Campaniam ducere exercitum instituit. Ac statim Richardum Monachum qui
idem Innocentii erat Sacerdos ad Cassinas Monasterium misit, qui moneret
Rinaldum (whom they had elected Abbot, adhering to the contrary party) se si
Innocentio obtemperare, and Lotharium recipere in animum induxisset,
Monasterium ab omni maleficio, atque injuria servaturum. Qua re audita,
Rinaldus Monachos advocavit, atque ut in fide Anacleti, Rogeriique persisterent
obsecravit, se enim Monasterium quod ab eis acceperit, in eorum retinere
potestate constituisse, subitoque auxilia nova ac civit, quibus se Monasterium
tueri posse confidit. Quae ubi Richardus vidit, ex loco decessit ac Civitatem
quae Monasterio continens est, Sacramentum dicere Innocentio jussit. Diebus
inde undecim interiectis Henricus Rinaldum ad se vocavit, acceptoque aureo
calice, and quadraginta libris, contraque obsidibus aliquot datis, Abbatiam
illi nomine Imperatoris firmavit, si in ejus fide mansisset, and vexillum
Imperatoris in arce quae aedi S. Benedicti, imminet, statuit. After many Sieges
and Battles all or most of the Cities in Capua, Campania, and Apulia being
taken by Lotharius his forces, and reduced to Pope Innocent, (recorded at large
by Sigonius) he thus proceeds in the Story of Rinaldus and his Monks, and Pope
Innocents deportment toward them, and Lotharius. Sigonius, ^. 11. p. 267, etc.

Jampridem ab Italiam ingrediens Senioreum Abbatam Cassinatem monuerat, ut si
cujus metu Romana Ecclesia defecisset se auctore in fidem ejus redire studeret,
quem universa Ecclesia Patrem agnosceret, se Monasterii jura exemplo superiorum
Imperatorum conservare paratum esse: eadem etiam a Richiza ad Monachos scripta
erant. Senioreto inde mortuo eadem renunciari, Rinaldo jussit, adjiciens, ut
quoniam infesto Sancti Petri Conventum Melfiam edixisset, ipse quoque Monachis
secum prudentissimis ductis eo veniret, omniaque Monasterii privilegia secum
ferret. Quibus Literis Rinaldus sibi obtemperandum ratus, Melfiam ad lacum
pensilem, ubi universus Lotharii exercitus cum Innocentio Pontifice confidebat,
accessit. Adventanti ei Innocentius nunciis obvian^ missis mandavit, ut prius,
quam castra iniret, ipse cum Monachis suis sibi nudis pedibus satisfaceret, ac
pro obedientia Anacleto exhibita, piaculum quod imponeretur, acciperet, ac
jurejurando omnia sua se mandata facturum, et Anacletum repudiaturum, sanciret:
Rinaldus subica re perturbatus An Appeal from the Pope to the Emperor himself.
Lotharium appellavit, and se ex ejus sententia deliberaturum respondit, atque
ita castra ingressus Lotharii jussu tabernaculum suum prope illius tabernaculum
posuit. Ea res animum haud mediocriter Innocentii perculit. Itaque missis
Cardinalibus, a Lothario postulavit, ut Rinaldum cum Monachis Anacleti
obedientiae renunciare, et sibi dicere sacramentum juberet, Monachis autem sibi
per Majorum suorum instituta, jurare fas esse negantibus, jussit, ut ab eorum
qui absentes essent, consuetudine abstineret. Qua re motus Lotharius diem 7
Idus Julias ad causam cognoscendam, constituit, atque utriusque partis patronos
in consilio, ad illam diem adesse praecepit. Ea ubi dies venit ipse cum
peregrino Patriarcha Aquileiense, Archiepiscopis, Episcopis, and Abbatibus
plurimis assidens ad Consilium, retulit, number Monachi Cassinates, quod Anacletum
recipissent, inpaenam Anathematis incurrissent? et number salvis legibus cogi ad
jurandum Innocentio obsequium possent? Res per multos dies magna altercatione
peracta est.

Emperor, who with so much pains and expense had twice restored him to his See,
from whence he twice fled and was ejected by Anacletus; and likewise the
Emperors Jurisdiction to be paramount the Popes, in calling, presiding, ruling
judging in Councils, even in Appeals, cases between the Pope, Church of Rome,
and other Ecclesiastical persons and Churches.

In nomine Domini Salvatoris nostri Jesu Christi, Anno ab incarnatione ejus
1138. indictione prima, septimo Idus Julii, Anno Imperii Domini Lotharii
Caesaris septimo, residente eodem invictissimo Principe ad aquas Pensiles,
consedente etiam Peregrino Patriarcha Aquilegiensi, cum Archiepiscopis,
Abbatibus quampluribus, Causidicus pro Romana Ecclesia directus est Gerardus
Cardinalis, titulo Sanctae Crucis, and Guido Cadinalis, qui ambo postea Romani
fuere Pontifices: Aimericus Cancellarius, and Diaconus Cardinalis Presbyter,
Baldwinus Cardinalis, qui post Pisanus Archiepiscopus fuit, and Misprinted
Robertus.
Bernardus Clarevallensis Abbas, and alii plurimi Romanae Vrbis Nobiles. Ex
part Casinensis Ecclesiae auditores fuere Henricus Dux, Imperatoris gener;
Conradus Dux, qui post imperii Sceptra tenuit, Otto Imperatoris consobrinus,
Fridericus Marchio Anconitanus, Mala Spina Marchio Liguriae, Henricus Episcopus
Ratisponensis, Hanno Episcopus Basiliensis, Hanno Abbas Luneburgensis,
Galfridus Palatinus, Romani Imperii Judex. Facto itaque silentio Imperator
dixit: Non modo praesentium, et temporalium, verum futurarum aeternarum rerum
in hoc conventu discussio erit. Constat enim, Sanctos Patres, dum unius rei
gratia Concilia saepe celebrarent, plurima unius occasion definiisse. Ita et
h^c Romanae quidem et Cassinensis Ecclesiae causa cum specialiter agi videatur,
variae tamen agente Deo, solventur quaestiones, fiet que unius Ecclesiae causa
salus omnium per orbem constitutarum. Nos quoque vestigia Praedecessorum
nostrorum sequentes, dignum duximus huic interesse Concilio, et eorum quae
dicentur librare monumenta. Defensores utriusque disceptantium partis
magnificos a nostro latere dedimus viros, qui violentiam omnem prohibeant.
Igitur in Domini nomine sedeant, quibus Romanae non displicent leges, taciteque
rerum exitum expectent, ne dum omnes confuse vel dicunt, vel obstrepunt,
veritas obnubiletur. Hac and alia plura dum praefatus esset Augustus, Conradus
ab Imperatore defensor datus, inquit, Copia Imperiasium verborum me fecit fandi

Gerardus Cardinalis Sanctae Crucis, qui pro Romana, and Petrus Diaconus, qui
pro Casinensi responderet Ecclesia. Interpretes dati sunt Bertulfus Imperatoris
Cancellarius, Anfredus Vestiarius, and Bertulphus Masionarius. Traditur autem
Gerardo locus ante Imperatoris faciem. Ad pides vero ejus constituitur Petrus
Diaconus. Renuit Girardus Monachum ad suos sedere pedes, dicent, nequaquam
oportere sive licere excommunicatum cum filio sedere Ecclesis. At Imperator
finem litigio imponens, Petrum Diaconum extunc and doinceps sedere ad pedes
suos jussit. Tum taliter Gerardus Cardinalis loqui orsus est. Sancta and
universalis Eccles^^, invictissime Imperator, quae and vos and praedecessores
vestros orbis totius dominatores effecit, mirari non desinit, cur
excommunicatores, and a laminibus Ecclesiae separatos receperitis. Ad haec
Imperator, Imperii quidem nostri nos ab Apostolica sede gaudemus accepisse
coronam, excommunicatos nullo pacto suscepisse putainus; hoc tamen ex conflictu
vestro constabit. Pandulphus Theanensis Episcopus Casinensis Monachus dixit,
Quomodo Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalis Cannenses Monachis excommunicatos asserat,
videre non possumu^. Girardus Cardinalis dixit; Quid mihi and tibi bone Tit?
Alienus nobis es. O mirum, O novum inauditumque prodigium, ut truncus ramis
praecisis, and a radicibus evulsus novas contra Ecclesiam erigat Machinas. Ad
haec The Emperor rules and moderates in this Council.
Imperator; Cesset, inquit, omnis violentia: hic enim non inferendae vel
referendae injuriae, sed ferendae potius aequanimiter sunt. Quocirca statuimus,
ut neutra pars utatur in alteram contumeliis, ne quod ad laudem Domini, et
posterorum utilitatem statuatur, in litigium riramque vertatur. Tunc Girardus
resumpto sermon, sic ait, Decrevit Sancta and Universalis Ecclesia, ut
Casinesis Coenabii Monachi voluntatem Domini nostri Innocentii pii and
universaliae Papae, se in omnibus impleturos Sacramento confirment. Jam enim
Innocentis ipse hos Casinenses Monachos dispergere per diversa loca statu rat,
nisi Lotharius Clementissi^^s Imperator, nolens Casinensem Ecclesiam destrui
pro ipsa Ecclesia contra Papae voluntatem se objecusset. Cumitaque Girardus
Cardinalis de Sacramento Monachorum sermonem fecisset, Petrus Diaconus
respondit, Non parum miramur, cur Dominus Cardinalis Monachos Sacramento velit
astringi, cum Dominus in Evengelio, See here, Book 4. chapter ^. p. 706, 707, 708.
Jusjurandum omnino (...) Girardus Candinalis dixit, Quod Monachus ait,
prob^mus; sed Romana Ecclesia Casinenses Monachos sine Sacramento recipien los
non esse dicernit. Patrus Diaconus ait, In regula Sanctissimi Patris nostri
Benedicti jurare omnino interdicitur Monachis. Quod non modo divinae, verum
humanae quoque prohibent leges. Quippe inter Imperatorum praecepta Caroli,
Ludovici, Hugonis, Lotharii, Berengarii, Alberti, trium Othonum, quinque
Heinricorum et Conradi, sic invenitur: statuimus, ut Monachi ad Sacramentum non
compellantur. Et haec dicens, pracepta ipsorum Imperatorum, Casinensi collata
Monasterio, auro, plumbo, ceraque signata, Imperatori caeterisque monstravit.
Ea Imperator praecepta excipiens deosculatus est, moxque in haec verba
prorupit: Magnorum Sanctorumque Principum haec esse praecepta, ex sigillis
agnovimus: Convenit Majestati nostrae, cuncta praedecessorum nostrorum servare
praecepta. Quare Dominum Apostolicum vos qui hic illius adestis vice, ex nobis
Regum Preces sun^ Imperiae.
orate, ut sanctissimorum Imperatorum praecepta nobiscum protegere, suaque
authoritate confirmare dignetur: Quis enim jam Imperatorem observaret si ab
Apostolico contemnatur? Omnia membra sequuntur caput, neque ab eo nisi magno
suo detrimento separari queunt. Certes itaque pro membris caput, pronatis
Pater, pro ovibus Pastor: quia nullo modo Lupirabies praevalet, ubi cura
sollicita pastoris invigilat. Sit igitur hodierno consensui finis, et hospitia
sua singuli repetant. Cardinales vota nostra Pontifici referant, Casinenseque
Caenobium ut mecum foveat nostra vice precentur, Monachi Electo suo quae dicta
sunt referant, et crastina die quid respondere objectis debeant, parent. Tertia
diei hora hic adesse singuli curent, hodiernusque tractatus, adhibitis
notariis, literis mandetur, ne oblivion^ tradantur, quae posteris quoque
profutura praevidimus. His dictis in sua quique disecssere. Imperator ad ea
quae sibi imminebant, negotia tractanda resedit.

Postera die utraeque convenient disceptantium parts. At ubi ingressis data
copia est fandi, Girardus Cardinalis dixit, Mandato pietatis vestrae,
Sanctissime Imperator, Note his Papal Pride, Obstinacy, malice.
retulimus summae Sedis Antistiti: Sed haec nullo modo implere se posse
respondit, asserens, facilius se Pontificalia vestimenta deponere, ac pedibus
subjecta calcare, quam quae abs te rogantur efficere. Ad haec Imperator
paulisper obticuit, De tunc reliquas disputationes hesternas concludere jussit.
Girardus dixit, Memini nos die hesterno de Sacramento Casinensium Monachorum
tractavisse, nihilque inde fuisse definitum: De eadem igitur denuo tractaturi,
denuo proponere debemus ex part Domini nostri, quae heri quoque proposuimus,
fidem, scilicet Apostolico a Casinensibus Sacramento promittendam, perpetuamque
obedientiam, alioquin nunquam illos patietur Domini corporis ac sanguinis
participes fieri. Ad haec Petrus, Constat inquit Dominum Cardinalem hesterni
tractatus renovasse conflictum, nostrosque terminos ad rediviva reparasse
certamina. Nobis contra satis superque videtur huic sententiae Dominicis
obivisse praeceptis, quibus See here Book 4. c. 2. p. 706, 707.
omnino jurare prohibemur: fidem autem a nobis Sacramento exigi profecto
otiosum est, cum hanc sponte simus exhibere consueti. Girardus inquit, Non est
veritus Monachus coram invictissimo Principe mendosa proferre, dicens
Casinenses Monachos Romanae Ecclesiae semper servasse fidem, cum constat
omnibus, eos hactenus schismaticos esse, Abbatemque a schismatico ordinatum
praefecisse. Petrus Prudentius inquit, Viri est, non ante quempiam falsitatis
arguere quam ipsum omnibus mendacium in conspectum dederit, and cum nihil
contra possit opponi a conscientia sua, qui mentitus est, ipse accusetur.
Inique igitur and oblique me petit Dominus Cardinalis, qui tacito mendacio me
falsitatis insimulat, proponaetur causa, aperiantur mendacia: tunc me fallacem
asserat, tunc mendacii arguat. Girardus, facile id quidem probare est. Nam cum
relicto Innocentio, schismatico adestis, quid nisi infideles fuistis? Petrus,
Deum ero, inquit, illum nos, an potius nos ille demisit? Girardus, Ecclesia,
inquit, a schismaticis capta, piissimus de sua sede est pulsus Episcopus:
sicque Italia relicta, properavit ad Gallias. Petrus; Nonne Pastor bonus
Christus Jesus cum diversitatem, imo unitatem in se unitam ostenderet: Joan. 10.
Bonus pastor, inquit, animam suam dat pro ovibus suis? Girardus, Haec, inquit,
non solum verbis, verum and factis ostendit. Petrus, Rursus ipse Dominus, cum
descripsisset optimi facta Pastoris, Mercenarii quoque mores adjunxit, dicens,
Mercenarius, and qui non est Pastor, cujus non sunt oves propriae, videt lupum
venientem, and dimittit oves, et fugit. Agnoscis profecto Evangelii verba.
Girardus: Ita sane. Petrus, Hocne Romanum agere Pontificem decet? Girardus;
Tanto, inquit, magis ab Apostolicae sedis sunt observanda Pontifice, quanto
peculiarius suscepit aliis praedicanda. Petrus, Quid igitur? Ovibus ne
imputabitur, si quid pastor amisit? Girardus, minime, inquit. Petrus, Ergo
Monachis imputandum non est, si Pastore destituti, morsibus lupi patuerunt.
Debuit enim Apostolicus (ut ait Dominus) oves suas non modo non dimittere,
verum pro eis quoque mortem libenter amplecti. Ad haec Imperator, Patet, inquit
ex assertione, Monachi si quid peccaverunt, Pastoris culpa contigisse, non
ovium. Vnde rogan^a adhuc est Domini Apostolici pietas, ut nobiscum, quae
contra nos gessere, dimittat. Quare hodiernae quaestioni finem placet imponi.
Occupati enim Reipublicae curis, diutius his interesse non possumus; quisque
igitur revertatur ad propria. Cras idem certamen rursum ineundum est. Hoc dicto
cum omnium favore discessum est.

Altera die, cum piissimus Imperator, memoratique Proceres, audituri quae
residua erant, consedissent, hac voce incipit; Cum exercitui, tum omnibus qui
intra Romanum orbem sunt, notissimum credimus, quanta in reverentia and
observatione Casinensem Ecclesiam, ut suam scilicet peculiarem Cameram, majores
nostri habuerunt; and super omnia Monasteria Imperii Romani dilexerunt,
honoribusque and privilegiis eximis exaltarunt. Deceret itaque dominum quoque
Apostolicum mecum eandem fovere Ecclesiam quod auxiliante Domino in posterum
fiet. Non est autem ista quae agitatur controversia, dicenda lis, 1 Cor. 12.
cum constet, membra secum litigare non posse, neque Caput dicere manui,
Necessarium te non habeo; neque oculus pedi; viliora saepe nostra utiliora
sunt. Nullus igitur, nos indecens aliquid existimet facere, quod Casinense
Monasterium quasi tueri videmur. Nam neque cum vel matter filiam, vel conjugem
vir, aut filium pater ira stimulante caeciderit, si quis se inter saevientem
patrem and paventem filium ob^iciat medium, natumque ab immoderata caede patris
eripiat, cum mansueverit, pater homini illi indignabitur, sed contra maximas
hab^bit gratias, quod filium e fuis subtraxerit manibus: ita et universalis
matter Ecclesia cum posita ira requieverit, gratias aget Imperio nostro, quod
ipsius irae subdurimus. Agantur ergo quae agenda restant: quia nunquam
desistam, quin compleam desiderium meum. His dictis, Girardus Cardinalis dixit,
Vestrae magnitudinis verba, sacratissime Imperator, and semper Auguste,
precesque Domino Innocentio Papae retulimus, sed nullo pacto, sine sacramento
Casinenses ut recipiat, induci potest. Petrus Diaconus dixit, Satis nos fecisse
his, and ex praecepto Domini, and ex Imperialibus edictis existimamus. Alia si
quae habes, edicito. Girardus, Ignoras, Invictissime Imperator, hos quos vestra
magnitudo defendit, cu^ Rogerio Siculorum Comite, contra Romanam Ecclesiam
vestrumque conjurasse Imperium, neque non solum conjurasse, verun
anathematizasse and damnasse? O Rem inauditam, ut ligati and ligent solutos,
and solvant ligatos! Ad haec Caesar indicto silentio dixit, Quod in me
Casinenses admisere libens tolero, grateque remitto. Exemplo itaque nostro,
quod in Romanum Pontificem commiserunt, et ipse dimittat. Girardus, Et si
Domini nostri Innocentii pii universalis Papae agimus vices, hujusmodi tamen
sine illo definire non possumus. His dictis favente Imperatore discessum est.
Nocte insecuta cum Imperator duraret pervigil, Petrus Diaconus genu flexo ante
illum ita pro Casinensi orabat Ecclesia, Cum omnes mortales vobis militent, ut
Domino rerum atque principi, Vos autem ipsi Imperatori Coelesti pacis, pietatis
atque justitiae autori, humiliamini: Aliter enim utriusque vitae salus tuta
esse non poterit, nisi talibus ministratoribus gubernetur. Itaque, Imperator
invicte, cum Majestatem vestram cunctas per orbem tueri Ecclesias deceat,
Casinensi tamen Ecclesiae ideo magis te exhibere convenit, quia magis opus
habet, cum nobis et loqui licitum non sit, et indulta ab Imperatoribus
privilegia pro nihilo habeantur. Nam Romano Pontifici obtemperandum et ipse
censeo: sed Deum illi quoque praeferendum, libera voce profiteor, neque enim
illi irrogatur injuria si sibi praeferatur Deus. Totus in Casinensis Ecclesiae
dejectione Monasticus ordo vacillat. Te ergo Imperatore, Monachis sua jura
tollentur? Te Imperatore a Monachis Sacramentum extorquebitur? Te tuamque
clementiam deprecamur, Imperator Invicte, ne hoc decernas, ne statuas, ne
hujusce decreto subscribas. Indignum profecto est, ut te agente abrogetur
Casinensis Ecclesiae dignitas, ut Cardinalibus proveniat malae voluntatis
affectus. Nihil majus est religione, nihil sanctius ordine Monastico, nihilique
sublimius Patre Benedicto. Quid respondebit Carolomannus pius Imperator
Augustus? Nonne tibi dicet, Imperium me dimisisse non credidi, quia Lotharium
justum and sanctum Imperatorem habebam, Imperium me deposuisse non dolui, quia
Imperia mea praesertim de religione Monastica inconvulsa perpetuo manner
credebam. Titulos ego pietatis, justitiae atque mansuetudinis in Casino
exexeram, has de mundi pressuris manubias referebam. Quid mihi plus potuit meus
hostis auferre? modo inquam, modo abrogantur decreta mea. Nunc gravius telum
excipio corpore cum a Romano Pontifice mea decreta damnantur. Nunc mihi
abrogatur Imperium, et quod est gravius, a Pontificibus Romany, et hoc
praesente fratre meo Imperatore Lothario. Cui enim magis quam sibi praestat
Imperator, si instituta majorum, si Casinensis Coenobii conservat? Nulli ergo
grave vidiatur, si defendimus religionis Monasticae siatum. Certe a beato
Benedicto ad Innocentium Papam, 113 Romani Pontifices nume rantur, ii omnes
Casinense Coenobium dilexerunt, coluerunt, auxerunt, nullus Religionem
violavit. Jam vero si quid meretur veneranda canities, beatum Benedictum
introducamus loquentem; Optime Imperator, Pater Patriae, Caesar Auguste,
reverere canos meos, in quos aetas me longa provexit. Utantur licite filii mei
legibus suis, a me sibi salubriter traditis. Decet enim ut vivant meo more. Per
hos occiduum Orbem in mea redegi jura, per hos Anglia, multaeque Nationes ad
Christum conversae sunt. Mea est horum salus, tutela, juvamen. Cum haec and his
similia Petrus orasset, ad Bertulfi Cancellarii tentorium, Imperatore jubente,
regressus est. Cum igitur evocati Cardinales ad Imperatorem egressi essent,
Girardus ait, Quae heri vestra sublimitas jussit Domino nostro retulimus:
benign vestra postulata suscepit. Causam tamen permolestam sibi a vobis
injungi conquestus est. Ius enim Episcopale, quod sui habuerunt majores, nullo
se pacto, nulla ratione posse dimittere. Lotharius ad haec: Nos, inquit,
Casmensem Ecclesiam eo magis honorare decet, quo majoribus nostris in honor ac
reverentia habitam scimus atque ditatam. Nam sciat Dominus Apostolicus, castra,
praedia, villas, omnemque Monasterii possessionem juris nostri esse. Episcopale
autem jus suum in nullo violamus. Bertulfus Cancellarius dixit: Nil juris sui
Apostolicus in Casinense debet habere Coenobium, quod Romani Imperii specialis
Camera esse decernitur, nisi Abbatis consecrationem, quam Heinrico Imperatore
concedente, habuisse, dignoscitur. Girardus, Placeat ergo consilium meum vestro
Imperio, Caesar invicte, ut vobis quibus Secularium, Apostolico vero
spiritualium rerum fidem sacramento confirment. Lotharius; Nostro valde
inhonestum videtur Imperio, Majorum nostrorum non servare mandata, eorumque
Sanctissimis non obedire praeceptis. Nam si nos illa negligimus atque no^umus,
quis ea servabit? Quo pacto alios haec servare compellimus, si nos ea
convellimus? Lex itaque Imperatorum non plus aliis, quam Imperatoribus ipsis
constituitur. Imo illos hanc magis servare convenit, ne a seipsis descivisse
videantur. Girardus Cardinalis dixit, Non parum quoque Dominus Papa miratur,
cum te Ecclesia in Caesarem orbis dominatorem consecraverit, cur contra eum
niti pro Casinensi Ecclesia videaris, quam non ad te ut asseris, sed ad se, ut
caeteras Ecclesias, pertinere testatur. Tum Imperator iratus: Immo (inquit) nos
valde miramur, cur nostris precibus annuere nolit, cum nos ipsius gratia annum
jam dimidium in Papilionibus commorati cum Romano exercitu, pecunias in usus
publicos deputatas, in ipsius obsequium converterimus, omnesque ultramontanos
populos illi obtemperare fecerimus. Quid ergo mirum, si Casinensem tuemur
Ecclesiam, cum constet, id a majoribus nostris gloriose actum? and illi quidem
eam tanti fecerunt, ut ibi magis quam domi sepeliri delegerint. Quid de
Sanctissimo and omni honor nominando Augusto Carolo dicam, qui relicto Imperii
sceptris, Monasticam ibi transegit vitam? Quid de ipsius Caroli fratre Pipino
loquar, qui defunctum apud se Monachum fratrem Casinum, ibi tumulandum, cum
honor remisit? Raches quoque Longobardorum Rex, relicto regno, ad ipsum
venerabile Monasterium venit, monasticamque ibi exercuit vitam. Quid de
Imperatoribus Justiniano, Justino, Theodorico, Pipino, Carolo, Pipino, Carolo,
Magno, binis Ludovicis, Hugone, duobus Lothariis, Alberto, tribus Othonibus,
quinque Heinricis? Quid de Constantinopolitano and Alexio referam? Qui omnes
Casinensem Ecclesiam et summo affectu dilexerunt, et magnis illustrabere
muneribus. Adeo Casinensis Ecclesia Imperatoribus extitit grata, ut ad ejus
liberationem Romani Imperatores cum omni exercitu venerint. Heinricus enim
^ius, invictissimus, Christanissimusque Imperator ad eam tuendam cum Centum
Octoginta millibus Militum Italiam ingressus est, eaqu^ a Capuam Principis
ditione sublatam pristinae restituit dignitati. Conradus autem Imperator
Augultus, and Heinricus ipsi iis filius cum Centum Sexaginta Millibus
pugnatorum ea, defensurus Ecclesiam venit, cum Pandulphi nequissimi, non aicam
Principis sed Tyranni jugo premeretur. Omittimus nova and nostra gesta memoria.
Antiquiora repetamus locique situ, cujus proprie fuerit videa^us. Varro nempe
(ut legimus) Romanorum nobilissimus ac doctissimus hanc sibi sedem eligisse,
extruxisse, multisque illustrem monumentis reddidisse, cognoscitur. Ipsum
Casinatem fundum (ut M. Tullius in Philippicis refert) Caesar Antonio tradidit.
At fortassis objicitur, Benedictum Patrem Romanae Ecclesiae alumnum, illud
instruxisse Coenobium. Quis id nesciat? Sed Romanorum nobilium sustultus
auxilio id eum fecisse cognoscimus. Beatissimo namque Papa Gregorio referente
d^dicimus, Beatum Benedictum una cum Mauro Senatoris equitii Placido ^ue
Tertulli patricii filio, ad Monasterium Casinense construendum divinitus fuisse
directum. Alibi quoque expressimus, Casinum cum finibus suis a Tertullo
pa^ricio jure suo haereditarso praecisum, Patrique Benedicto traditum legimus.
Quid plura? aut Romana Ecclesia Romani Imperii Cameram Casinense Coenobium
decenter accipiat, aut ab ea Romanum Imperium irrevocabiliter separabitur.
Girardus Cardinalis ait, Nequaquam, invictissime Caesar, vestra indignetur
mansuetudo, nec super Domini Apostolici indignetur mandatis, neque Domini
Innocentii pii and universalis Papae mandata videantur injusta. Verum siquid in
his displicet, ad eum referatur. His dictis, quarti diei est solutus conventus.

Mane facto, cum utraeque parts ante Imperatoris praesentiam constitissent,
Girardus qui vicem Romanae gerebat Ecclesiae, dixit. Noverit vestra Celsitudo,
Caesar invicte, haec Dominum Apostolicum vestris ita annuisse mandatis, ut
vestri causa, fidelitate omissa, Sacramentum solummodo obedientiamque requirat.
Interim quoque de electione Abbatis nobis injunxit disputandum; qua ratione
Excommunicatum, et quod gravius est, Schismaticum (Rinardum) Ecclesiae Christi
praetulerunt? In which debate Petrus Diaconus proved the right of electing the
Abbot to belong only to the Monks by several instances, without the Popes
concurrence; justified their election of Rinaldus to be lawful, answering all
Girardus his objections to the contrary, who insisted principally on the
Excommunication and schism of Rinaldus. Ad haec Imperator respondit, Et quae
injuse hactenus gere Casinenses Monachi, eis per omnia impetranda censuimus:
haec petitionis mea summa, quam a Domino Apostolico rego, ut eis quae usque in
praesens incautius admiserunt, remittantur* Sit ergo finis hodierni conflictus.
Nostra iterum rogata ad Papam referantur and pos^ diem quintam quid jubeat
audiemus. Has autem indicias idcirco damus; ut definire melius ac stature
possit. His dictis quique ad sua rediere. Petrus vero Diaconus in Curia
remansit Imperatoris. Cardinales itaque ad Apostolicum redenutes, quae dicta
fuerunt ei retulere, dicentes; quendam Romanum esse Casinensis Ecclesiae, qui
solus pro suo Monasterio contra Romanam disceptaret Ecclesiam. Hunc si quo
constrinxeris vinculo, alios omnes pro nihilo reputabis. His Innocentius
auditis, interrogat, quod illi genus patriaque sit? Et illi, Pater (inquit)
ejus Gregorii filius fuit, Romanorum Ducis and Consulis. Tunc Papa, auxiliante
Deo, et illum, et alios tali praepedivit compede ut contra ipsum mutire non
auderent: vehementique ira concitatus, cum post quartam diem referri Imperatori
verba praecepit, Dominium Casinensis Ecclesiae non ad illum, sed ad se
pertinere, sicuti et Ecclesiarum reliquarum. Decreveramus, inquit, vestra
interventione infidelitatem dimittere Monachis, verum quia nituntur contra nos,
et haec, et alia ab eis inquirenda consulimus. Mandat deinde Pontifex per
Benedictum Capellanum suum Petro Diacono, ut ab Imperatoris famulatu recedens,
a Casinensium quoque fratrum societate se separaret: indignum esse ut Romano
genere exortus, exteros praeferat contribulibus, Romanam Ecclesiam linquens:
Proinde si Casinensibus dimissis, illos impugnare omnibus modis mallet, se
illum inter Capellanos suos habiturum. Ad quem ille talem remisit responsum,
Gratiam agens, quod se tanti aestimasset, ut obsequio suo dignum judicaret.
Caeterum non posse se Socios in tali articulo constitutos deserere. Post
peractum negotium, se in servitio Sedis Apostolicae and Romani in fide
Pontificis, quod vixerit, si ille vellet, permansurum. Post haec decernit Papa
per omnia loca Casinensi Ecclesiae subdita literas mittere, ut Casinensi Abbati
and Monachis non obedirent, omniaque Coenobia quae sub praepositis erant, sibi
Abbates eligerent. Sed omnipotens Deus consilium Pontificis, voluntatemque
impedivit. After this a Cistercian Monk scoffing at the Monks for adhering to
Anacletus, and asserting their election of Raincrus to be void, forged and
reprobate: Ad haec Lotharius, De omnibus (inquit) quae contra nostram Cameram
Casinensem Ecclesiam Cistellensis objecerat, Petrus Diaconus lucide satis
aperteque respondit. Sed hujus altercationis iste sit finis. Singuli ad
hospitium redeant, mane rursum ad conflictum redituri.

Die altera, ubi lux est reddita terris, Imperator accersitis Magnatibus suis
in Consistorio resedit, and utrasque disceptantium parts coram se ingredi
jussit: Et dum venisset Cistellensis, hujusmodi disputationis initium dedit,
etc.

Die altera Girardus Cardinalis ex part Sedis Apostolicae veniens, Imperatore
pro tribunali residente, ait; Romana Ecclesia, sacratissime Imperator, and
semper Auguste, non ab hominibus, neque per hominem, sed per Iesum Christum
fundata est, qui Petrum Apostolorum Principem illuc direxit, cui etiam claves
regni coelorum tradidit: and idcirco nullum illius gratia violari debere
Apostolicus censet. Petro autem respondente, Nunquam Romanum Pontificem a
Casinensibus Monachis Sacramentum exegisse. Girardus ait, Ideirco eos non haec
quaesisse, quia usque ad illa tempora in Ecclesiae unitate mansissent; sed
postquam schisma incurrissent, absque Sacramento recipiendos non esse:
protulitque jussu Papae Innocentii, Capitulum Niceni Concilii, ut revertentes a
schismate absque Sacramento non reciperentur. Lotharius Imperator dixit, Non
vos idcirco congregavi, ut Canonum jura servetis, sed ut benign, ut leniter
cum Ecclesia Casinensi ageretis; Meminisse debetis, quae in Romana Ecclesia
beneficia ipse contulerim, quot et quanta pericula pro vobis cum exercitu
perpessus sim, qualiter annum integrum, ac menses duos in tentoriis egerim,
quot propinquos et amicissimos inter bellorum amiserim fremitus. Non enim
Casinenses fratres, ad inimicum Pontificis, sed ad Romanum Imperatorem
Ecclesiae propugnatorem confugere. Postremo, si me ea spe frustratum esse
vultis, contestor hodie, schisma inter me et Pontificem futurum, et pro amico
obsequentissimo infestissimum fore inimicum. Cumque ad hanc Imperatoris vocem
exercitus omnis acclamasset, rectaque prosecutum, fremens diceret: Primo, per
omnes Episcopos; Secundo, per Archiepiscopos; Tertio, per Aquilegiensem
Patriarcham; Quarro, per Abbates; Quinto, per Comites; Sexto, per Marchiones
and Principes; Septimo, per Richizam Augustam; Octavo, per seipsum Imperator
Pontificem hac de causa rogavit. Mandat dehinc Pontifex Imperatori, de
Casinensi Ecclesia consilium ejus voluntatemque se facturum. Caesar hoc nuncio
laetior factus, rursum per seipsum Pontificem adiit. Supplicanti itidem pro
Casinensi Monasterio: Miror, ait Pontifex, cur tanta pro illis oras instantia,
qui te ac me anathematizarunt; qui Petri Leonis filium pro Papa receperunt; qui
Coronae alteri obtemperarunt, hactenusque in priori nequitia durarunt. Tunc
Imperator Clementissimus totus solutus in lachrymas, dixit; Scio equidem illos
haec omnia ideo egisse, ut integer ad nos Ecclesiae ipsius status perveniret.
Nam si secus egissent, Ecclesia illa ab hostibus nostris eversa jaceret. Unde
oro, ut censuram, qua plectendi illi erant, in me retorqueatis. Si caedendi
sunt, ego pro eis dorsum submitto; si deponendi, deponi pro eis volo. Tunc
Papa, Canonicae severitatis rigorem vestri causa temperamus. Jure enim
deponendi erant, qui participarunt excommunicatis, qui Pontificem suum
Anathematizarunt. Sed nos lenitate usi atque clementia, vestri amoris gratia
(not for Christ's sake, or command) cuncta dimittimus. Ita tamen, ut Filium
Petri Leonis ejusque accomplices anathematizent, mihique ac successoribus meis
obedientiam promittant. Ista dum Imperatori placuissent, beatae Martyris
Simphorosae die misit Imperator Rainerum cum electo and fratribus Heinricum
Ducem generum suum, Conradum Ducem, nepotem Henrici 5. Imperatoris, Ottonem
Consobrinum suum, omnesque Archiepiscopos, Episcopos, Comites, Duces, ac Romani
Imperii Proceres. Cumque Papae tentorium appropinquassent, Cardinales
occurrentes interrogabant, Sifilium Petri Leonis renuere paratus esset? Quo sum
ille annuisset, protinus electum in hac verba jurare fecerunt. Ego Rainaldus
refuto et anathematizo Schisma omne, et omnem Haeresim extollentem se adversus
Sanctam et Apostolicam Ecclesiam. Anathematizo etiam filium Petri Leonis, et
Rogerium Siciliae Comitem, omnesque illorum accomplices, et obediens ero Domino
Papae Innocentio, et Successoribus suis canonice intrantibus. Cumque Rainaldus
in haec verba jurasset, reliquos (Monachos) similiter jurare cogebant. Illi
autem Patri Benedicto ejusque successoribus se jurasse, atque ideo Sacramentum
se exhibere non posse dicebant. Tunc Rainaldus, ex part Patris Benedicti, ac
sua praecepit, ut obedientiam, quam B. Benedicto ejusque successoribus sibique
exhibuerant, in manu Papae promitterent. Sicque constricti fratres, quod
electus ad Evangelia, hoc illi juxta tenorem Chartulae in manu Episcopi
Hostiensis juraverunt, adjectoque hoc insuper, Quod si Casinensis a Romana
Ecclesia divisa fuerit, ego in Monasterio non remanebo, neque Abbati obediam,
salva Romani Imperii fidelitate. Haec ubi ad Papae libitum impleta sunt, ab
excommunicationis nexu absoluti, nudis pedibus ad Papae vestigia, deinde ad
osculum recepti sunt. Petrum vero Draconum Innocentius ad se evocans dixit:
Praecipio tibi in virtute Spiritus Sancti, and per Sacramentum, quod hodie mihi
and successoribus meis praestitisti, te a^juro, ut quacunque hora literas vel
nuncium meum acceperis; non habes licentias ultra remorandi: sed quamprimum
poteris vestigiis sedis Apostolicae and Pontificis, qui pro tempore fuerit, te
representare studeas. Nolo enim ut pia Romana Ecclesia inquietetur. Post haec
Rainaldus ad Imperatorem deductus, and ab eo magno cum honor susceptus, cum
fratribus inter Imperii Capellanos constitutus est. Nam usque ad eam diem
Imperatoris obtutibus praesentatus non fuerat. A^^^al^volis tamen post^a in
suspicionem adductus, singulari Papae livore depositus est. Such was this Popes
Christian candor, charity, fidelity toward him, after this solemn
reconciliation, notwithstanding the Emperors mediation. And to demonstrate his
unparalled ingratitude to the Emperor, who with extraordinary expense and
travel had twice by force of Arms suppressed his Competitor, and restored him
to his Papal Authority, Chronicon Casinense, l. 4. c. 118. Cent. Magd. 12. c.

exoritur (non de Doctrina, de qua nihil erant sollici^^) quam quidem solus
Imperator Lotharius potuit dirimere: Res ad Imperatorem delata est, et ejus

Sanctae Mariae (quam Christo aedificaverat) sepultus est.

How corrupt, unjust, this Pope, his Cardinals, and the Court of Rome were, and
how ungrateful they proved even to St. Bernard himself, after all his travel
and pains for them; his Epistles to them thus relate to posterity. Bernardi
Epist. 158, 159. ad Dominum Papam Innocentium.
Thomas Prior S. Victoris in France; Vir religiosus, in itinere quod induxerat
pietas, in opere sancto, in sanctorum Comitatu, in Dominico die, certe in sinu
Episcopi Parisiensis, and inter manus ejus, crudeliter ab impiis excerebratus
est, by the instigation of another Clergyman of Noble extraction; who to secure
himself from legal proceedings in France for this murder, appealed to Pope
Innocent, and there found favor and protection; Of which St. Bernard thus
complained to this Pope; In quantam misera devenit amentiam, ut fera pessima
quae devoravit Joseph, vaga and profuga, and tremens super terram, illuc
potissimum fugam inerit, ubi plus timere oportuit? Sceleratissime, tu summae
aequitatis sedem, putas esse speluncam latronum, aut cubile leonum, etc. S^^^s
inquam impune ferat, quod utique mira impudentia de vestra Apostolica
Authoritate praesumit, quanta putamus impunitas ista in Ecclesia parturiet
punienda unum de duobus fore, necesse est, aut nullos ex nobilibus sive
potentibus secundum hoc seculum, admitti deinceps ad honores Ecclesiasticos;
aut passim ad omne illicitum permitti libere Clericos sacris abuti officiis, ne
forte si quispiam Zelo Dei accensus prohibere tentaverit, ferro illico militari
reus justitiae trucidetur. Atque ita quid spirituali gladio, quid censurae
Ecclesiasticae, quid Christianae legis and disciplinae, quid reverentiae
sacerdotali, quid denique divino timori relinquitur, si metu potentiae
secularis nullus mutire jam audeat contra insolentiam Clericorum? Quid enim
insolentius, quidve indignius in Ecclesia esse potest, quam ut sibi quisque
Ecclesiasticas vendicet dignitates seritate armorum, non morum probitate?
Quamobrem Domine Pater, aliquid ut videtis prorsus decernendum in hominem quod
Ecclesiae prosit, ut salus facta hoc tempore per vos transfundatur in posteros,
and cognoscat generatio altera non solum quod fuit praesumptum, sed and
qualiter ultum. Alioquin si serpat venenum, nec sequatur pariter antidotum,
multos (quod absit) habeat perimere. Yet his 160, 161, 162, and 163 Epistles
prove, that contra jus et fas this murderer found protection at Rome, and so
escaped unpunished.

In his Epist. 166. ad Dominum Papam Innocentium (to whom he had complained at
large in his 164. Epistle, of the fraud, rashness, injustice of the election
and consecration of the unworthy Bishop of Lingon, against the Archbishops,
Deans and Canons promises to him, and this Popes command, without the least
redress upon several Appeals to him against his election) he writes thus;
Iterum clamo, iterum pulso, and si non clamosis vocibus, certe lachrymosis
gemitibus; cogit iterare clamores, iterata in nos injuria perditorum and
prolongantium iniquitatem suam. Confortati sunt addentes praevaricationem.
Apponunt iniquitatem super iniquitatem, and superbia eorum ascendit semper.
Invaluit furor, pudor evanuit, and timor Dei. Quem contra tuam, Pater, castam
justamque dispositionem non timuerunt eligere, etiam post Appellationem tui
nominis ausi sunt execrare. Et hoc praesumpserunt Lugdunensis, Edunensis,
Matisconsis, ac amici Cluniacensis. In fraud and temeritate istorum heu quam
ingens multitudo sanctorum turbabitur, si angariati fuerint tali portare jugum
taliterque impositum. Proh nefas, hoc ita accepturi sunt, ac si cogantur genua
curvare Baal, Esaias 28
aut certe juxta prophetam, pactum facere cum morte, and cum inferno fedus
inire. Rogo ubijus, ubi lex, ubi sacrorum auctoritas Canonum, ubi denique
reverentia Majestati? Illa, illa, quae nulli negatur oppresso, soli mihi non
profuit Appellatio, Vbi nimirum imperabat aurum, judicabat argentum, leges
Canonesque silebant, locum ratio et aequitas non habebant. Eisdem telis (quod
intollerabilius est) arcem quoque Apostolici culminis oppugnare minantur. Id
vero ridiculum; Fundaeta est enim supra firmam Petram. Sed quid ago? Excessi
fateor; non est meum accusare quemquam aut reprehendere; sufficit mihi ut
plangam dolorem meum Post longam moram multosque labores quos pro servitio
Romanae Ecclesiae pertuli, cum tandem placuit Serenitati vestrae reditum
annuere ad fratres meos, etsi fractus viribus Corporis tanquam male operans,
laetus tamen ob manipulos pacis, quos reportabam, ad Monasterium cum
prosperitate perveni. Credidi me de labor evasisse ad requiem, licere mihi
utcunque resarcire spiritualium damna studiorum, ac sanctae quietis detrimenta
quae foris incurreram; et ecce tribulatio et angustia invenerunt me: En lectulo
recubantem plus Cordis quam corporis dolor excruciat. Nec enim Ego deploro
temporale incommodum ullum; Anima mea in manibus meis, salus ejus in causa est.
Placet vobis, ut illi homini credam animam meam, qui perdidit suam? Scio quod
non placet. Quamobrem dixi animae meae, expedire magis inire fugam quam and
maerore consumere residuum dierum meorum, and nihilominus in periculum solertis
incidere. At Deus vobis potius inspiret, quod potius est, reducere (viz.) ad
memoriam (si dignum judicatis) qualiter vobiscum egerim, and ponere oculos
pietatis super puerum vestrum, and liberare afflictum de angustia; quin potius
non oblivisci, quanta Deus ipse fecerit vobis, and in quantulecunque vicem
recompensationis, ad ipsius gloriam, quod tam perperam factum est, revocare.
This business he again pressed to this Pope, Epist. 167. concluding it thus,
Nisi isti a tam scelerato, tamque temerario ausu deficiant (ut meipsum nunc
sentio) deficiet in dolor vita mea; and anni mei in gemitibus: Which he thus
backed with an Epist. 168.
Epistle Ad Episcopos and Cardinales Romanae Curiae; Vos scitis, si dignum
ducitis recordari, qualiter vobiscum in tempore malo conversatus sim, egrediens
and regrediens, and pergens ad imperium Regis: Ps. 114.
persistens ac permanens vobiscum in tentationibus vestris, ita ut consumptis
pene viribur corporis, vix post redditam caelitus pacem Ecclesiae repatriare
potuerim. Et recolo hoc non glorians, aut improperans, sed provocans and
efflagitans, monens and reposcens debitum vestrae miserationis affectum. Urget
necessitas modo omnes repetere debitores. Ego vero si feci quod facere debui,
haud aliud me ex eo quam servum inutilem reputo, juxta sermonem Domini.
Veruntamen si feci quod oportuit, aut quod faciendum fuit, nunquid merui
vapulare? Et ecce rediens a vobis tribulationem et dolorem inveni, et nomen
Domini (to wit, Innocentii Papae) invocavi, sed non profuit. Invocavi et
vestrum, et non valuit. Siquidem Dii fortes terrae vehementer elevati sunt, Ps.
49. 6.
Lugdunensis scilicet Achiepiscopus, and Cluniacensis Abbas. Hi confidentes in
virtute sua, and in multitudine divitiarum suarum gloriantes, adversum me
appropinquaverunt and steterunt: Et non adversum me tantum, sed adversum magnam
multitudinem servorum Dei, adversum vos, quoque adversum seipsos, contra Deum,
contra omnem aequitatem et honestatem. Denique imposuerunt hominem super capita
nostra, quem, proh pudor! and boni horrent, and mali rident. Quo ordine, imo
quam extraordinary, videat Deus and judicet: Videat, et doleat Romana Curia:
Videat, misereatur et accingatur ad vindictam malefactorum, laudem vero
honorum. Quid enim? Placet tibi, domina mundi universitati constituta est,
vindex in iram, judex in miseriam, placet inquam, tibi quod dum superbit
impius, incenditur pauper, and ille pauper qui pro tuo servitio, cum non
haberet Censum quam effunderet, sanguini non pepercit? Dignum ne tibi videtur
tua perfrui pace, and nostram non curare, nec recipere in sortem consolationis
quos habuisti consortes laboris? Si inveni gratiam in oculis vestris, Ps. 35:
10.
eripite inopem de manu fortiorum ejus, egenum and pauperem, ab eripientibus
eum. Alioquin ego quidem ut potero laborabo in gemitu meo, and erunt mihi
lachrymae meae panes die ac nocte, Job 6.
vobis autem legem illum versiculum, Qui tollit ab amico miseriam, Psalm. 37.
timorem Domini derelinquit. Et illud, omnes necessarii mei recesserunt a me.
Illud quoque, Qui juxta me erant de long steterunt, and vim faciebant, qui
quaerebant animam meam.

In his 178 Epistle ad Dominum Papam Innocentium, pro Alberone Treverensi
Archiepiscopo, he writes thus; Querimonia Domini Treverensis non est ejus
solius, sed communis multurum, eorumque praecipue qui sinceriori affectu vos
diligunt; Vor una omnium qui fideli apud nos cura populis praesunt, justiciam
in Ecclesia deperire; Annullari Ecclesiae Claves; Episcopalem omnino vilescere
authoritatem, dum nemo Episcoporum in promptu habeat ulcisci injurias Dei;
nulli liceat illicita quaevis, ne in propria quidem Parochia castigare. Causam
referunt in vos, Curiamque Romanam. Recte gesta ab ipsis, (ut aiunt)
destruitis: just destructa, statuitis; Quique flagitiosi et contentiosi de
populo, sive de Clero, aut etiam ex Monasteriis pulsati currunt ad vos,
redeuntes jactant et gestiunt se obtinuisse tutores, quos magis ultores
sensisse debuerunt; An non gladius Phinees promptissime atque justissime
eductus fuerat, ad condemnandum incestuosum concubitum Drogonis and Milis? sed
confusis atque retusus abiit retrorsum: Scuto nimirum Apostolicae defensionis
opposito. Proh pudor! quos Cachinnos res ista movit, et movet Ecclesiae
inimicis, eisque etiam ipsis quorum fortasse metu aut favore a recto tramite
abducti sumus? Amici confunduntur, fidelibus insultatur, Episcopi ubique in
opprobrium veniunt et contemptum, quorum dum recta judicia contemnuntur,
vestrae quoque plurimum derogatur Auctoritati. Ipsi sunt enim qui honorem
vestrum zelant, qui vestra pro pace, and exaltatione laborant fideliter quidem,
sed vereor ne inefficaciter. Quid vobis vires minuitis? quid robur vestrum
deprimitis? Quousque retunditis arma fidelia militantia vobis; humiliatis
cornua erecta vestrae virtutis, and salutis? Plorans plorat desolationem suam
apud Tullum Ecclesia Sancti Gengulsi, nec est qui consoletur eam. Quis enim se
opponat brachio excelso, torrentis impetui, summae arbitrio potestatis? etc.
Which he thus aggravates in his 179 Epistle to him. Quomodo malitia vincit
sapientiam? Nosti pie Domine, nosti Treverensem Archiepiscopum? Scio quod
nosti. Nosti and illum Sancti Maximini non sanctum Abbatem? Puto quia non
nosti. Quis dignior honor illo priori? Sic nemo confusione digmor isto
sequenti, and tamen iste honoratus est, ille opprobriodatus. Quid peccavit
Archiepiscopus, praedam Ecclesiae suae recuperavit, captivam Ecclesiam de manu
Laica liberavit, etc.

In his 180 Epistle to him, he shows how Popes and the Court of Rome did often
times err in their determinations by misinformations. Iterum supplicatio,
iterum preces, and decies repetitae te non desinent. Non desistimus, quia non
diffidimus. Bonam causam habemus, et aequum judicem qui non cunctabitur
evacuare quod subreptum est, cum apparebit quod verum est: nec poterit inde
ridere qui voluit irridere, sed ut scriptum est, Mentita est iniquitas sibi.
Hoc solet habere praecipuum Apostolica seeds, ut non pigeat revocare quod a se
forte deprehenderit fraud elicitum, non veritate promeritum. Res plena
aequitate, and laud digna, ut de mendacio nemo lucretur, praesertim apud
Sanctam and summam Sedem. But notwithstanding all St. Bernards importunate
successive Letters, Merits, Piety, the Justice of his own and others causes he
recommended to this Pope Innocent, his Cardinals and Chancellor, the heavier
purse overballanced them, and carried the cause, though never so unjust or
irregular, during this Popes domination, as well as his predecessors; as these
Epistles and other Testimonies evidence.

In his 213 Epistle ad Dominum Papam Innocentium, he thus expostulates with him
for his Injustice, in styling him a Traitor to him; Quis mihi faciat Justitiam
de vobis? Si haberem judicem ad quem vos trahere possem, jam nunc ostenderem
vobis quid meremini: Extat quidem Tribunal Christi; sed absit, ut ad illud
appellem vos, quia illic si vobis necessarium, and mihi possibile esset, vellem
magis totis viribus stare, and respondere pro vobis. Itaque recurro ad cum cui
in praesenti datum est judicare de Vniversis; hoc est, ad vos: Vos appello ad
vos; vos judicate inter me and vos. In quo quaeso puer vester tam male meruit
de vestra Paternitate, ut eum inurere et insignire placeret nota et nomine
proditoris? etc. Quisnam ergo constantiae vestrae, suo consilio, vel magis suo
dolo subripuit, indulta repetere, and quae processere de labiis vestris facere
irrita? Epist. 216, 217. he writes to this Pope, Scriptum est, Quod Deus
conjunxit, homo ne separet. Mat. 19.
Surrexerunt viri audaces qui non timuerunt conjunctos a Deo contra Deum
disjungere: Neque id solum, insuper and adjecerunt conjungere non conjungendos,
addentes praevaricationem. Lacerantur sacra Ecclesiae, scinduntur proh dolor
vestes Jesus Christi, idque ad cumulum doloris ab his a quibus resarciri
debuerint: Amici tui Deus, and proximi tui adversum te appropinquaverunt and
steterunt, etc. Comitem Radulphum and unxorem ejus, Deus conjunxerat per
Ministros Ecclesiae, and Ecclesia per Deum, Psalm. 37,
qui dedit talem potestatem hominibus: Quomodo quos Deus conjunxit, disjunxit
camera? In quo facto illud solum convenienter provisum est quod in tenebris
facta sunt opera tenebrarum. Joan. 3. 20.
Qui enim male agit odit lucem, and non venit ad lucem, ut non arguantur opera
ejus a luce. Quid meruit Comes Theobaldus? Quid peccavit homo ille? Si peccatum
est, quod diligit justitiam, and odit iniquitatem, non potest excusari. Si
peccatum est, quod reddit Regi quae Regis sunt, and quae sunt Dei, Deo; non
potest excusari. Si See here, p. 28.
Archiepiscopum Bituricensem suscepit ad Imperium vestrum, hoc est maximum and
primum peccatum: En sanguis iste de manu ejus exquicitur, etc. Tribulatio and
angustia invenerunt nos: Ipsa religio venit in opprobrium and contemptum.
Probro ducitur apud nos saltem mentionem facere pacis: Nusquam fides, nusquam
innocentia tuta. Amator innocentiae, pietatis cultor Comes Theobaldus pene
traditus in animam inimicorum ejus: And in his excusatory last Epistle to this
Pope he thus complains he was fallen quite out of his favor (only for his just
reprehensions of his Injustice, abuses, and disobeying his unjust commands.)
Domino and Patri Reverendissimo Innocento B. nihilum id quod est. Epistola 218.
Putabam me aliquando aliquid vel modicum esse; Sed nunc ut sentio prorsus ad
nihilum redactus sum, dum nescivi. Nec enim me dixerim omnino nihilum tunc
fuisse, cum oculi Domini mei super puerum suum essent, and aures ejus ad preces
meas; cum omne quod scriberem obviis manibus accepisset, and vultu hilari
perlegisset, benignissime atque plenissime ad omnia postulata respondens. Modo
autem me merito non modicum dico, sed nihilum, quoniam ab heri and
nudiustertius avertit faciem suam a me. Cur hoc? Quid peccavi? Multum fateor,
si pecunia Cardinalis Yvonis bonae memoriae meo arbitrio distributa fuit, and
non ad nutum ipsius, quod utique ad aures Domini mei fuisse perlatum, mihi
relatum est which act he justified, referring the Pope to his forecited Epistle
written to his four Cardinals: In fine, he thus complains of Epistola 182.
Henry the Archbishop of Sienna his proceedings, just like the Popes and Court
of Rome, Multiplicatis vobis accusatores, defensatores subtrahitis; Provocatis
adversarios, patronos offenditis: Vbique apud vos pro ratione voluntas; totum
pro imperio, nihil pro timore Dei. Qui de vobis non rident inimici, non
conqueruntur amici? Quomodo devestitis hominem, non dico judicio non convictum,
sed nec verbo conventum? Quantus hoc verbum scandalizabit? quot ora ad
subsannandum? quot corda ad succendendum movebit? Itane putatis periisse
justitiam de toto orb, sicut de vestro cord, et homo sic ablatum perdat
Archidiaconatum? etc. Haec vobis mordacius audaciusque quam velletis audire
scripsi, sed non ad insipientiam vobis si velietis corrigere.

That the Kings of France maintained, exercised their ancient right of
Investing of Bishops and Abbots by a Ring and Pastoral Staff, and usually gave
their Royal assents to and confirmed their elections, under Pope Innocent and
his Predecessors, notwithstanding all their Canons to the contrary, is evident
by these Passages in St. Bernard, (no Friend to Investitures) who informs us in
general: In caena Domini, De Baptismo, etc. Sermon. 2. f. 31. L. M.
Multa siquidem facta propter se tantum; alia vero propter alia designanda, and
ipsa dicuntur signa, and sunt; ut enim de usualibus sumamus exemplum; datur
annulus absolute propter annulum, and nulla est significatio: datur ad
investiendum de haereditate aliqua, and signum est, ita ut jam dicere posset
quid accepit: Anulus non valet quicquam, sed haereditas est quam quaerebam.
Variae sunt investiturae secundum ea dequibus investimur: Verbi gratia:
investitur Canonicus per Librum; Abbas per Baculum, Episcopus per Annulum and
Baculum. In his 164. Epistle to Pope Innocent concerning the Cause of the
Bishopric of Lingon pending by Appeal before him he informs him, that the
Bishop of Lingon being elected, against the consent of the Dean and others, yea
against the Popes Order and Electors promise to him; the Archbp. of Lions upon
St. Bernards importunity refusing to consecrate him; he thereupon privily
procured an Investiture from the King, and then was ordered to be consecrated
at another day and place: Interim nempe homo qui and consecrationem fugerat and
electionem refutat, festinavit ad Regem; Regalium investituram obtinuit, quibus
meritis ipse viderit: Mox directis Epistolis, and locus qui assignatus fuerat,
est mutatus, and dies anticipatus, ut loci temporisque opportunitate
substracta, and copia agendi pariter, subtrahatur contradicturis, and
consecrationis dies subripiatur appellaturis. Caeterum non est consilium contra
consilium Domini, cujus providentia factum est ut nec contradictores defuerint
nec appellatores. Appellatum est a Falcone Decano Lugdunensis Ecclesiae, etc.
and others to the Pope against his Consecration. St. Bernard, as he writ
several Epistles to the Pope in favor of the Appellants, so he sent an Epist.
170.
Epistle ad Ludovicum juniorem Francorum Regem, desiring him to revoke his
Investiture granted to this Bishop being unduly elected, and unfit for that
Charge, and to invest the Bishop duly elected by the contrary Party; Which
begins thus: Si totus orbis adversum me conjuraret, ut quippiam moliter
adversus Regiam majestatem, ego tamen Deum timerem, ac ordinatum ab eo Regem
offendere temere non auderem: Nec enim ignaro ubi legerim; qui potestati
resistit, Dei ordinationi resistit, etc. Non imminuetur honor Regis, regnique
utilitas per nos: Nam in quo alio regia majestas; recte in eo quod factum est
imminuta dicatur? Electio rite celebrata est; electus fidelis est; Non esset
fidelis si vestra autem et non per vos habere vellet. Necdum ad vestra manum
extendit, necdum civitatem vestram ingressus est, necdum prorsus se intrusit de
aliquo, quanquam invitatio Cleri and Populi, and oppressorum afflictio, and
vota bonorum id ab eo vehementissime flagitarint, etc. Quae cum ita sint, opus
est, ut videtis, maturatione consilii, non minus vestro honori, quam nostrae
necessitati: and nisi per praesentes nuncios expectanti populo, qui vester est,
Serenitas vestra pro voto responderit, multorum religiosorum adversum vos (quod
non expedit) devota vobis nunc corda turbabitis, et regalibus vestris ipsis,
quae ad Ecclesiam pertinent, non parvum, ut veremur, incommodum acquiretis. c
Romans 19.


In another Epistle Ludovico Regi Francorum pro electo Antisiodorensi, Epistola
282.
he writes thus of the usual Elections of Bps. in France, the Kings Prerogative
to grant Licenses and approve elections when made, and differences likely to
arise between the King and Pope in case of a Provision by the Pope without the
King Volui ego unquam in aliquo imminui honorem Regis, dignitatem regni? Deus
scit, nec vestra ut confido conscientia id vobis respondet. Videte ne illi
magis contra vos faciant qui electiones disturbant, ne sint in Ecclesiis qui
serviant Regi, sed ipsis de Ecclesiarum redditibus serviatur. Ego, ego
electioni Antisiodorensi interfu^; concors fuit: quia Clerici qui ante hac in
parts dissilierant, six contradictione nunc tandem, Deo miserante
convenerunt. Electum been novimus, testimonium ei perhibemus, quoniam bonus
est. Neminem prorsus arbitror affuisse illi celebritati qui de assensu vestro
dubitaret, cum jam idem assensus vestris literis teneretur. Quis enim hoc vel
cogitare posset, repetendum alterum assensum, nec sufficere unum; praesertim
ubi nulla extunc intervenit altera electio? Nunquid quociens dissenserint
Clerici, totiens erit requirendus favor Regis? Nec ratio, nec consuetudo hoc
habet. Denique nuper, si recordamini, in S^^essionensi Ecclesia quotiens ad
eligendum Clerici convenerunt, quotiens disserserunt, and infecto negotio
discesserunt, nec tamen existimo totiens repetisse assensum vestrum quem semel
promeruerant. Ita est Dominus Rex, non est quod debeatis reprobare factas
electiones quibus ut fierent semel vos assensisse constiterit. Sed sunt aliqui
qui vos conturbant, and conturbaremtuntur Ecclesias, sua lucra sectantes;
quodque gravius est, summi Pontificis et Serenissimi Regis mutuam gratiam et
amorem Diabolico studio dirumpere molientes. Absit hoc: judicium portabunt
quicunque sunt illi, et Rex semper faciet quod bonus Rex sicut hactenus fecit.
Itaque cito mandentur jocundiora, ne diutius sedeat in tristitia Ecclesia
tamdiu jam vexata and afflicta. De persona nulla subeat suspicio, aut ego
nimium fallor, aut fidelis erit, et Regi beneplacitum superea. Consido in
Domino quod non contristabitis multitudinem Sanctorum qui sunt in illo
Episcopatu, nec me servum vestrum, qui, ut verum fatear, nihil aeque unquam a
vobis molestum pertuli, quam si in hoc consilio quod non eveniat,
praestiteritis.

The Continuator of Sigeberts Chronicle (Robertus de Monte) informs us; Anno
1241. f. 139. b. and An. 1243. f. 140. Centur. Magd. 12. c. 10. col. 1248.
that Anno 1241. there arose a great difference between this Pope and the King
of France, by reason of his making and consecrating one Peter Archbishop of
Bituris by his Provision, without the Kings consent. Orta dissensione inter
Papam Romanum, and Francorum Regem Ludovicum Ecclesia Gallicana turbatur.
Defuncto enim Alberico Bituricensi Archiepiscopo, missus est Petrus a Papa
Innocentio eidem Ecclesiae Pastor consecratus, sed a Rege Ludovico repudiatus,
eo quod sine ejus assensu fuerit ordinatus, in Civitatem minime recipitur;
cujus parts quia propter reverentiam seu voluntatem Papae Comes Theobaldus
fovere videbatur, simultas quae sopita putabatur inter Regem et ipsum coepit
repullulare: The King besieging his Castles, and raising War against him as a
Traitor, for receiving and assisting this Pseudo-Archbishop Peter, by the Popes
command, burning a Church and no less then 1300 souls therein in his Castle
of Vitriacum, which he took by force; for which he was sharply reprehended by
St. See Bernardi Epist. 216, 217. 219, 220, 221, and here, p. 378.
Bernard, Hist. Angl. Ann. 1146. p. 77. Philip de Mornay, Hist. Papatus, p. 300
and excommunicated by Pope Innocent. After this (as Rex Francorum Lodowicus a
Papa Eugenio excommunicatus.
Mat. Paris informs us) An. 1146. Eodem Anno Papa Eugenius Parisiis veniens,
consecravit Petrum quendam Aimerici Ecclesiae Romanae Cancellarii nepotem, in
Archiepiscopum Bituricensem. contra Lodowici Regis Franciae voluntatem. Quod
Rex injuria suae dignitatis factum vehementer indignans, propositis public
sacrosanctis reliquiis, in praesentia multorum juravit, quod Archiepiscopus
praefatus, quamdiu ipse viveret, Civitatem Bituricam non intraret. Sic per
triennium Regis persona subjacuit interdicto. In quamcunque civitatem, vicum
vel castellum intrabat, suspendebatur celebratio divinorum. (Such was the
atheism of these Popes to prefer every punctilio of their own absolute wills
and usurpations, before the Sacred public Worship of God himself, and the
peoples salvation) Tandem Bernardi Abbate Claravallensi persuadente ad hoc, est
Cor Regis inclinatum, ut Archiepiscopum reciperet, et pro transgressione
perjurii, Hierosolymam se promitteret profecturum. Igitur per totam Galliam,
fit exactio generalis, nec genus, vel ordo, aut dignitas, quempiam excusavit,
quin auxilium Regi conferret. Vnde factum est, ut ejus peregrinatio multis
imprecationibus persequeretur. A remedy far worse then the disease, and an
over-dear compensation for his perjury in departing with an ancient royal
indisputable prerogative, against his solemn Oath.

The Letter of St Bernard to the Church of Rome in the behalf of this young
King, is very remarkable; wherein he excuses the rashness and temerity of his
forecited Oath, by the custom, generosity of the French Nation, the youth and
courage of the King; Epist. Bernardi 219. fol. 220. Number. 16.
thereby in a manner betraying the rights of the Crown of France, to the
usurpations of this tyrannizing Pope. Quantum malum schisma in Ecclesia, and
quam sit detestandum, and omnimodis devitandum, evidenter quondam ostendit
fam^sae and horrenda mors virorum illorum quos ob istiusmodi pestem terra
deglutiens, vivos transmisit ad inferos; ostendit and illa persecutio
Guibertina, sive Burdini temeritas quae nostrae jam tempora experta sunt, inter
Regnum and Sacerdotium dividentes, plaga pene incurabili, and castigatione
crudeli. Ostendit and illa quae nuper adhuc post multam and multifariam
Ecclesiae vexationem, Mat. 18. 7.
and vastationem, tandem Deo miserante ^^nem accepit, rabies Leonina. Merito
proinde Salvater in Evangelio, Vae (inquit) homi^ illi, per quem scandalum
venit; Vae vobis qui vivimus plangere quae pertulimus, dolcre quae sentimus,
timere quae expectamus. Et quod pejus est, ad tam malum habitum humanae res
devenerunt, ut nec rei humiliari velint, nec Judices misereri. Dicimus,
iniquis, nolite inique agere, Psalm. 74.
and delinquintibus, Nolite exaltare cornu, and non audiunt nos quia domus
exasperans est. Luke 17.
Supplicamus his quorum est peccata arguere, peccantes servare, Ne calamum
quassatum conterant, and linum fumigans non extinguant, and magis in Spiritu
vehementi conterunt Naves Tharsis. Isay 42.
Si denunciamus filiis cum Apostolo, ut obediant patribus per omnia, quasi
acrem verberamus; Ephesians. 6.
Si Patribus loquimur, ne ad indignationem provocent filios, in nos potius
eorum indignationem provocamus. Nec delinquentes satisfacere, nec Rectores seu
correctores condescendere ullatenus acquiescunt. Omnes suum stomachum sequuntur
and totis viribus funem in diversa trahentes, rumpunt. Heu nec dum recenti
Ecclesiae plagae cicatrix occalluit, and rursum scindere parant, rursus Corpus
Christi assigere cruci, rursus fodere latus innoxium, rursus vestimenta
dividere atque ipsam quod in ipsis est tunicam inconsutilem (quamvis frustra)
dirumpere satagunt. Si qua in vobis sunt viscerae pietatis, tantis vos opponite
malis, ne in illa praecipue terra scissura fiat in qua solent sicut optime
nostis scissurae aliae resarciri. Nam si author scandali, ore singulariter
judicis tremendo addicitur maledicto, quibus putamus benedictionibus dignos
hujus nequitiae fugatores and propugnatores? De duobus non excusamus Regem, nam
et juravit illicite, et perseverat injuste. Verum id non voluntate, sed vere
cundia. Nam probro ducitur, sicut optime nostis, apud Francigenas juramentum
solvere quamlibet male public juratum sit, quamvis nemo sapiens dubitet
illicita juramenta non esse tenenda. Veruntamen ne in hoc quidem excusari posse
fatemur, neque enim excusare nos, sed veniam postulare suscepimus. Vos videte
an excusare aliquatinus eum possit ita, aetas, et Majestas. Poterit sine dubio,
si misericordiam judicio superexaltandam decernatis, quatinus videlicet, talis
aliqua consideratio in Rege et puero habeatur, ut hac ei vice tali quidem
tenore parcatur, quo tale aliquid de caetero non praesumat. Parcatur sane
dixerim, si fieri possit (salva in omnibus Ecclesiae liberate) simul and
Archiepiscopo debita veneratione servata, quae manus Apostolica consecravit.
Hoc ipse Rex humiliter petit, hoc nostra universa citramontana nimium jam
afflicta Ecclesia suppliciter deprecatur. Alioquin damus manus morti,
tabescentes and arescentes prae timore and expectatione quae supervenerunt
universo Orbi. Siquidem deprecatio mea super hoc ab anno priore, and peccatis
meis exigentibus deprecationem meam non exauditio, sed indignatio,
indignationem autem desolatio pene universae terrae secuta est. Siquid Zelo
urgente erupit, quod non fuit, aut secus quam fuit dicendum, sit quaeso apud
vos quasi non dictum. Vbi vero dixi, quod oportuit, and ubi oportuit dici, sit
non frustra dictum.

As for Kings Supremacy over Archbishops, Bishops, Clergymen, their due
Subjection, and paying Tribute to them, as well as Abbots Subjection to their
Diocaesan Bishop in that age, St. Bernard thus notably proves it from Christ's
own Precept, President, and the Centurions in the Gospel; Bernardi Ep. 42. ad
Henric^ Senonensem Archiepiscopu^.
Nolite illorum acquiescere consiliis, qui cum sint Christiani, Christi tamen
vel sequi facta vel obsequi dictis opprobrio ducunt. Ipsi sunt qui vobis dicere
solent, Servate vestrae sedis honorem. Decebat quidem ex vobis, vobis commissam
Ecclesiam crescere, nunc vero saltem in illa quam suscepistis maneat dignitate.
Si non crescit per vos, non decrescat per vos. Christus aliter jussit, et
gessit; Reddite, ait, quae sunt Caesaris Caesari, and quae sunt Dei Deo. Marc.
22.
Quod ore locutus est, mox opere implere uravit: Conditor Caesaris, Mat. 17.
25, 28.
Caesari non cunctatus est reddere censum, ex^mplum enim dedit vobis, ut et vos
ita faciatis. Quomodo vero Di Sacerdotibus debitum negaret reverentiam, qui
hanc secularibus quoque potestatibus exhibere curavit? Porro vos si Caesaris
successori, i.e. Regi, sedulo in suis Curiis, consiliis, negotiis,
exercitibusque adestis, indignum erit vobis cuicunque Christi Vicario taliter
exhibere, qualiter ab antiquo inter Ecclesias ordinatum est? Sed quae sunt
(inquit Apostolus) potestates, Romans 13.
a Deo ordinatae sunt. Viderint ergo hujus ignominiae dissuasores, quale sit
Dei ordinationi resistere. Valde ignominiosum servo si sit sicut Dominus ejus.
aut discipulo si sit sicut magister ejus. Plurimum se vobis defer putant, cum
vos Christo praeferre conantur, ipso reclamante ac dicente, ^ohn 13.
Non est servus major Domino suo, neque Apostolus eo qui misit cum. Quod non
dedignatus est Magister et Dominus, talisque et Magister et Dominus, indignum
sibi judicabit servus bonus devotusque discipulus? Quam pulchre locutus est
beatus ille Centurio, cujus fidei nulla par inventa est in Israel; Et ego
(inquit) homo sum sub potestate, habens sub me Milites. (...). 7. 8.
Non jactabat potestatem quam nec solam protulit, nec priorem. Dicturus quippe,
habens sub me Milites, praemisit, homo sum, and homo sub potestate. Praemissa
siquidem est humilitas, ne altitudo praecipitet. Dedit prius honorem prae
positis, ut jam a subjectis just reciperet, sciers se a supertoribus accipere
quod impenderet inferioribus, and quia melius propriae subjectionis disceret
experimento sua ipse moderari imperia, etc. Miror quosdam in nostro ordine
Monasteriorum Abbates hanc humilitatis regulam odiosa contentione infringere,
and sub humili (quod pejus est) habitu and tonsura, tam superbe sapere, ut cum
ne unum quidem verbulum de suis imperiis subditos praetergredi patiantur, ipsi
propriis obedire contemnant Episcopis: (yea Regibus and Principibus suis, of
which he formerly discoursed;) spoliant Ecclesias ^t emancipentur; redimunt se
ne obediant. Non ita Christus: Ille siquidem dedit vitam ne perderet
obedientiam, quam illi, ut careant, totum fere suum, suorumque victum
expendunt. And did not Popes, Popish Prelates, Abbots then do so likewise,
spending their own, and others revenues to exempt themselves from due
obedience, taxes to their own Emperors and Christian Kings?

Pope Innocent Anno 1143. having by the forces and valor of the Romans reduced
the Rebellious Tiburtes, Anno 1143.
punished them far less then they demerited, Carolus Sigonius de Regno
Italiae, l. 11. p. 275.
and the Romans expected; whereupon, Romani, qui a parta victoria ferociores
evaserant, and irati, ac^rbiore poena Tiburtes afficiendos putabant, a
Pontifice flagitarunt, ne tantam defectionem tam molli vindicasse condition
vellet; Tiburtes mernisse, ut muris disjectis e Latii finibus truderentur,
neque ipsum a defectionibus esse tutum futurum, nisi in auctores eorum atrocius
esse foret animadversum. Contra vero innocentius, postulationem eorum iniquam
esse contendit, neque in dedititios, ac veniam pacemque petentes, tam acerbe
consulere convenire, ab Ecclesia certe, quae communis omnium matter esset, tam
acre vindicandae contumaciae studium abhorrere. Quod ubi Romani audiverunt, ira
vehementius exarserunt, quod neque hosts a quibus laesi essent, puniri pro
libidine possent, neque aequi aliquid a Papa impetrarent, cui operam magno suo
detrimento navassent. Itaque tumultu in urbe concitato, ac Civitate antiquo
seditionis morbo furente, Concionem extemplo in Capitolio convocarunt. Ibi pro
se quisque ferocissime ac superbissime est loquntus, atque antiquam Romanorum
animorum opemque magnitudinem ipsa verborum magnificentia, atque orationis
granditate est facile consecutus. Ad extremum multis dictis sententiis, omnes
in eam quae maxim popularis, and splendida visa est, descenderunt. Veterem
Romanae libertatis statum restituendum; (being all weary of the Popes Tyranny,
Vassallage, and resolving to shake off his usurped power over them) pristinos
ordines, magistratusque Reipublicae reponendos, Pontifici unam sacrorum
curationem relinquendam in urbe esse. Hoc decus, hanc speciem dignitatis
majores saepe, sed irrito incaepto tentasse; id eo sibi apud posteros
splendidius ac magnificentius for^e, si ipsi tantam urbi laudem, majestatemque
pepererint; pro certo autem parituros, si viribus suis agnitis parem ad caussam
animum, constantiamque attulerint. Ad hanc itaque opinionem venisse See p. 35^.
Arnoldi haeretici potissimum auctoritate videntur, cujus ejusmodi tum adversus
Pontificem decreta vulgari hominum sermon celebrabantur. Itaque inita
defectione, ordinem Senatorium jampridem extinctum popularibus suffragiis
revocarunt, ac bellum cum Tiburtibus renovarunt. Innocentius his rebus
cognitis, primum per amicos summa auctoritate praeditos Romanos redigere ad
sanitatem contendit; dein^e ubi se incassum labornare animadverterit, ad
infesta edicta confugit, ac populum Romanum a sacris amovet, eumque
Pontificiorum jure Comitiorum, cujus a primis temporibus ad eum usque diem
particeps fuerat, spoliavit. Verum ne ita quidem furorem sanare eorum potuit.
Itaque in timorem Romani amittendi Dominatus adductus, tantum ex ea re
sollicitudinis hausit, ut langore confectus 8. Ralendas Octobris pericrit. Haec
cum Innocentio instituta contentio tanti momenti fuit (as Sigonius observes) ut
omnes deinde Pontifices usque ad Clementem tertium exercuerit.

Cardinales excluso populo ad Comitia convenerunt, ac postridie ejus diei
(imperante Conrado) Vidonem Civem, Castellanum, ex Cardinaliiu^ collegio,
Pontificem sublegerunt, ac mox consecratum Caelestinum secundum vocarunt, Vir
grandaevus, supervires quaedam animo concipiens adversus Rogerium Regem
Siciliae, propter eandem Siciliam quae juri Apostolico competebat. Fuerat autem
alumpnus Andegavensium, eorumque manus corroborare in depressionem Regis
St^phani Angliae proposuerat, (such was his treachery) had he not suddenly been
cut off by the Plague (then raging in Italy) 5 months and 13. days after he
was elected Pope; his short life hindering him from doing so much mischief as
his predecessors to the Crowns of Emperors, Kings and the Church of Christ. I
shall only transcribe 2. Epistles of St. Bernard, the one to this Pope
Caelestine himself, the other to the whole Court of Rome, in behalf of Henry
Murdas the intruded Archbishop of York, setting forth their gross corruption,
Injustice, and Pope Innocents too, with the mischief, and vexation of Appeals
from foreign parts. Bernardi Epist. 234. See Godwins Catalogue of Bishops, p.
456. Henry Murdac:
Ad Dominum Papam Caelestinum, pro intruso Eboransi, Epist. 234. Oportet vos
secundum justitiam quae ex lege est suscitare semen fratris vestri defuncti,
quod digne implebitur, si Papae Innocentio cui in haereditate Domini
successistis, and defenditis been gesta and minus adimpleta perficitis. Prae
manibus est, in quo id liceat experiri. Causam Eboracensis Ecclesiae per eum
fuisse decisam quis nesciat? At quomodo executioni mandatum sit quod egressum
est de labitis tanti viri? utinam nesciretur. Quis det ut non annuncietur in
Geth, neque in compitis Ascalonis! Sed ut verbum abbrevia^um faciam auribus
occupatis, audiat paucis Dominus meus quid dictum fuerit, and quid factum tu
neamus. Cum in multis accusaretur is qui sili vendicare electionem in praefata
Ecclesia impie cupiebat, tandem omnis controversia ad testimonium viri
illustris Willielmi ipsius Ecclesiae tunc Decani conquiescere jussa est, ut
nisi capitulum intrusionis quod huic inter caetera impingebatur ille propriae
manus juramento amoveret, suis omnino cona^ibus tanta frustraretur ambitio. Hoc
autem non ex ju licio, sed ex misericordia. Sic enim rogaverat ipse. Mitissima
plane sententia, quippe cum de plurimis and pessimis pulsaretur qua nullatenus
propulsare valebat, sed utinam vel ipsa stet. Quid enim si non sufficit Iuri,
dummodo sufficiat Ecclesiae liberationi? Non causamur sententiae remissionem
quae nil nocuit. 2 Reg. 1.
Neque enm proficit adversario etsi largior indulgentia, qui ne ipsum quod
ultro spoponderat implere praevaluit. Nam de quo praesumere visus est defecit
ei ne sibi ipsi desiceret, ^ejerans. Quando enim vir bonus attestaretur homini,
quem rumor publicae opinionis and operis veritas detestatur? Quid ergo? Ille
non juravit, and iste Episcopus est? O rem ignorantia omnium dignam, et
perpetuo si fieri poset silentio comprimendam: Verum id sero, Heu notus est
orbi triumphus Diaboli, ubique personat plausus incircumcisorum et planctus
bonorum, pro eo quod videatur sapientiam vicisse malicia. Monstratur digito
matris Ecclesiae turpitudo, Patris Innocentii verenda irridentur denudata a
servo nequam, quoniam mortuum putat, sed vivit in vobis. Si is exitus imminebat
cur e longinquo Romam est pertractata causa spurcissima, umbra magis ex angulo
digna? Cur tanta mari terraque a multis assumpta fatigatio? Cur a finibus
terrae evocati viri religiosi qui eum accusarent, et pauperum Christi marsupia
longi itineris expensis exhausta sunt? Non poterat Episcopari turpis infamisque
persona (quod invitus dolensque loquor) nisi quam in illo horrebat Anglia,
Francia abominabatur, etiam Roma cognosceret? Quanto melius in Romana Curia
causa ejus minime ventilata fuisset: et non tangeret vel sacra limina generalis
atque horribilis faetor? Quanto tolerabilius ignorasset Apostolica seeds tam
intolerabile malum, quam tolerat manifestum? Quid istud temeritatis fuit?
public infamatus, ante indicem accusatus, nec purgatus, imo et convictus, et
sic consecratus est? Viderit qui huic manum post ista imposuit, an magis
execratus dicere debuerim. Non enim negabit sic se ista habere, non negabit si
se er literis Apostolicis ad se pro hoc ipso directis eadem comperisse. Dicat
forte aliquis quod non est datum judicium, non fuisse convictum. Ego dico and
confessum. Nam qui ut judicium evaderet, ultro elegit ad testimonium Wilhelmi
Decani confugere, illo sibi deficiente, quid risi suo judicio a causa decidit
ore proprio condemnatus? Quae cum ita sint, Vide Domine Pater ne declinet cor
vestrum in opus malitiae, Psalm. 124.
quoniam secundum Prophetam, declinantes in obligatione adducet Dominus cum
operantibus iniquitatem. Alioquin quod consilium datis missis Abbatibus illis
quos ad accusandum eum vocatio Apostolica Romana traxit, sed and aliis
quampluribus ex illo Episcopatu viris religiosis, sint ne obedituri huic, and
Sacramenta accepturi ab homine bis intruso? primo quidem per Regem, deinde per
Legatum. Quippe qui illum in Sanctuarium Dei contra jus et fas, contra mandatum
Summi Pontificis in injuriam summae Sedis, et totius Romanae Curiae, cum non
potuit per ostium, fodit argenteo (ut aiunt) sarculo, unde impudenter intrusit.
Ante (nisi fallor) suis sedibus exulabunt, quam dare acquiescant manus Idolo
huic, nisi vestra violenta authoritas obviarit. Caeterum quam Sanctiori
vestroque Apostolatu digniori zelo gladium Phinees in confusione duorum tam
turpiter fornicantium stringeretis, quam tot sanctos aut de suis fugere locis
permittitis, aut contra conscientias suas cogit remanere.

His other Epistle Ad totam Curiam Romanam, Bernardi Epist. 235. fol. 222.
runs thus; Dominis and Patribus reverendis, Episcopis and Cardinalibus Curiae
Romanae, frater B. Claravallis vocatus Abbas salutem, and nostras qualescunque
orationes. Omnibus scribendum fuit de eo quod spectat ad omnes. Nec vereor ne
forte praesumptionis arguar, quippe qui licet omnium minimus, tamen Romanae
Curiae injuriam, a me non judico alienam. Vrimur assidue dico vobis, urimur
graviter nimis, ita ut nos taedeat etiam vivere. In domo Dei videmus horrenda,
et quod corrigere nos non possumus, saltem suggerimus his ad quos spectat.
Siquidem emendaverint been; sin autem, nos animas nostras liberavimus, vos
excusationem non habetis de peccato; Non ignoratis, prolatam esse sententiam a
Domiao Papa bonae memoriae Innocentio, cum vestro and Romanae Curiae generali
assensu, irritam esse Wilhelmi Eboracensis electionem, immo intrusionem, nisi
Wilhelmus alter, tunc Decanus, quod objectum ei fuerat, propriae manus
juramento repelleret. Nec vos latuit quam plena esset sententia, non judicii
sed misericordiae, nimirum cum hoc Wilhelmus ipse quaesisset. Sed utinam vel
ipsa stet, and quod adversus eam factum est stare non possit. Quid enim, Non
juravit ille, et iste in Cathedra pestilentiae sedit? Quis tribuat ut adversus
fornicationem hanc, Phinees cum pugione procedat, aut vivat in sede sua Petrus,
qui Spiritu labiorum suorum interficiat impios? Multi clamant ad nos in toto
cord suo: ut sacrilegium hoc digna animadversione vindicare studeatis.
Alioquin dico vobis scandalum magnum nimis erit in Ecclesia De^, et timen ne
Romanae sedis authoritas gravem admodum jacturam et detrimentum grande
suscipiat, nisi in eum qui pervertit generalem ejus sententiam vindicta
processerit, et taliter ut caeteri metum habeant. Quid enim de eo dicam, quam
occultas, et vere tenebrosas literas habuisse se gloriatur Wilbelmus ille;
utinam a Principibus terrarum, non a Principibus Apostolorum. Et ecce audierunt
filii incircumcisorum, subsannant Romanam Curiam, a qua post datam tam
manifestam sententiam furtim datas esse aiunt contrarias literas. Quid dicam
vobis? Si non vos urit scandalum grave quo scandalizantur, non pusilli, sed
magni et perfecti viri, si non compatimini pauperibus Abbatibus quos a finibus
terrae vocatio Apostolica Romam traxit: si non miseremini magnis et religiosis
Monasteriis quibus omnino sub incubatore illo destruction imminet, si (quod
primum dicere debui) Zelus domus Dei non comedit vos. Nunquid usque adeo
inimici hominis versutia praevalebi^, ut proprium quoque contemptum, et
infamiam hanc pessiman Ecclesiae Principes aequanimiter ferant? Quid enim si
sacrile gam homo ille consecrationem recepit? Profecto long gloriosius, erit
jam elevatum d^jicere Simonem, quam prohibere conantem. Alioquin, quid facietis
religiosis viris, qui omnino non inveniunt salva Conscientia; vel ipsa communia
Sacramenta de leprosa manu suscipere? Ante (nisi fallor) eligent fug^re, quam
dare manus morti, and exulare priusquam vesci idoloticis. Quod si contra
conscientias suas coegerit eos Romana Curia curvare genua ante Baal, videat
Deus et Iudicet, videat Curia illa caelestis, in qua nulla poterit ambitione
subverti judicium. In fine omnium obsecrat vos puer vester, per viscera
misericordiae Dei nostri, si quis in vobis est Zelus Dei, miseremini Ecclesiae
Sanctae saltem vos amici ejus, and quantum potestis date operam, ne tam
detestabili facto detur assensus. But this Pope and the whole Court of Rome
turning the deaf ear to these his Epistles; he thereupon (some years after)
backed them with two other Epistles to Pope Eugenius, his Scholar, and familiar
friend, which I shall here insert.

Ad Dominum Papam Eugenium, Bernardi Epist, 238.
de Ebor^censi intruso, Epistola 238. Importunut sum, and habeo excusationem
Eugenii Apostolatus excusat me. Aiunt non vos esse Papam, sed me, and undique
ad me confluunt qui habent negotia. Nec desunt in tanta multitudine amicorum,
quibus officium negare non possum, non solum absque scandalo, sed etiam aebsque
peccato; Et nunc est etiam alia excusatio non minus idonea, quia causa
honestissima est, contra Idolum illud Eboracensi iterato stylus dirigitur, ea
scilicet necessitate, quod saepenumero hoc telo impetitum a nobis necdum
confossum est. Cur hoc? Quia nil forte a nobis tale directum est, qualis fuit
Gladius Jonathae qui nunquam rediit retrorsum; Nec sane fuit culpa jaculi, sed
dirigentis jaculum, Patet enim quod non in ea qua oportuit fortitudine missum
est; Nec mirum, Quis enim in manu forti sagittas mittere potest; nisi filius
excussorum? Qui locum Petri tenet, potest uno ictu extinguere Ananiam, uno
Simonem Magum, and ut planius quod loquimur fiat, peremptoriam dare sententiam
ad depositionem Episcoporum solius Romani Pontificis non scitur esse, pro eo
nimirum quod and si alii multi vocati sunt in partem sollicitudinis, solus ipse
plenitudinem habeat potestatis. Solus perinde si dicere audeam in culpa est, si
culpa non feritur, qua ferienda est, et eo impetu quo fuerit ferienda. Quo
autem impetu non dico ferienda sed fulminanda fuerit, praedicti Eboracensis
culpa, vestrae conscientiae derelinquo. Caeterum quod factum non est vobis
credimus reservatum, ut in eo experiatur Ecclesia Dei, cui ipso auctore
praestis, fervorem Zeli vestri, potentiam brachii vestri, and animi sapientiam,
and timeat omnis populus Sacerdotem Domini, audiens sapientiam Dei esse in illo
ad faciendum judicium.

Ad eundem pro eodem. Epistola 239. Quam cupio semper illa de vobis audire, in
quibus glorificetur Deus, honoretur Ministerium (vestrum, and anima mea
letificetur. Inde est quod audita responsione vestra, de quibusdam qui ad
officium legationis nimium videbantur, and ambitio^e ^spirare, and impudenter
sperare, supra quam dicere possumus facti (...) laetantes, Non autem nos
tantum, sed and omnes qui diligunt nomen vestrum, gavisi sunt gaudio magno.
Porro visis literis vestris quas pro causa Rutinensis Ecclesiae de^^nastis;
tunc prorsus, tunc repletum est gaudio os nostrum, and lingua nostra
exultatione, etc. Age ergo transeat ^am Sanctus hic pietatis zelus, and ad
miseram illam Ecclesiam transmarinam quia tempus mi^erendi ejus Vin^a Domin:
Sabbath est, vinea electa, vinea speciosissime, sed heu in desertum pene
redacta, quod singularis ferus depascitur eam; Cur dicunt inter gentes, Vbi est
Deus ejus? Vbi quem posuerunt custodem in vineis? Vbi manus putans? Vbi
sarculus excolentis? Quousque sarmento inutili occupatur tellus, suffocatur
fructus? Et certe tempus putationis advenit. Siquidem homo pacis ejus in quo
speravit, quod se purgare deberet, non purgatione ^ed amputatione opus esse
testatur. Extant denique literae ipsius de eo ad Apostolicae sedis legatum, in
quibus manifest manifestam asserit intrusiorem, electionem negat. Ita ergo
quem sibi paraverat defensorem, accusatorem sustinet. Ad haec quae ubique de co
publica fama concelebrat, etiam virum militarem possent omni jure spoliare
Cingulo Militar^. Quamodo ^am poterit stare ubi multiplex vobis sub est ratio
de^^ciendi, and voluntas non deest? Legi siquidem Zelum vestrum pro Ecclesia
illa in Literis vestris and jam exigo de manibus vestris. Quanam via
procedendum sit ad ejus dejectionem (neque enim una (...) esse videtur) non est
meum dictare sapienti. Nec multum nostra interest in qua part arbor i^
fructuosa cadat, dummodo cadat. Dico tamen, qui sibi possessionem vendicat
furtivarum commertio literarum, Nonne fur est and latro? Denique ubi asserit
habuisse se clandestinas literas execrationis suae, aut verum est aut falsum
quod loquitur; Si verum, reus est furti, et Summi Pontificis criminator. Si
falsum, debet audire, occidisti et possedisti. Sap. 1.
Os enim quod mentitur occidit animom. Sed absit ut tanta de tali viro credatur
duplicitas, quanta ab ipso ei imponitur. Nempe Innocentius hic erat, cui si pro
se respondere liceret, proculdubio diceret huic, quia ego palam in te dedi
sententiam, and in occulto locutus sum nihil. At last, to satisfy St. Bernards
importunity, Thom^s Stubbs, Acta Pontificum ^horacensium, col. 1721, 1722
Godwins Catalogue of Bishops
Eugenius removed William by his Papal power, and presently consecrated Henry
Murdac Archbishop, sending him into England with his Pall, to the great offense
of our King Stephen, who was much grieved with the disgrace of William (being
his Cosen) which all men judged undeserved. The King thereupon denied to admit
him, unless he would swear fealty to him in an extraordinary manner; which he
refusing, the King detained his Temporalities, and the Citizens of York shut
their gates against him, for which resistance he interdicted the City;
whereupon diverse seditions and tumults were raised for the space of 3. years,
till his submission and reconciliation to the King. Upon the death of Pope
Eugenius and St. Bernard, (Williams heavy adversaries) he repairing to Rome
complained to Pope Anastatius his successor, of his unjust deprivation by
Eugenius; upon tyding of the death of Murdac, the Pope sensible of his former
Injuries sustained, without any great suit, restored him unto all his honors
of which he was unjustly deprived; soon after he returned with his Pall to his
Archbishopric, notwithstanding a new Appeal of the Dean and Archdeacon of
York to hinder his installment. Of which more in its due place; being here
inserted only to evidence the gross Injustice, Corruption, Bribery of Pope
Innocent, Caelestine, Eugenius, and the Court of Rome in cases of Appeals, by
St. Bernards testimony, and Pope Anastatius his resolution, particularly in
this case of William Archbishop of York, relating to England; I now return to

After the death of Pope Caelestine the 2d. Anno 1144. post triduum Cardinales
convocati, Gerardum Caccianimicum, Civem Bononensem, quem Honorius ex canonico
regulari Cardinalem Sancti Crucis in Jerusalem coaptaverat, sublegere, eoque
cons^crato, Lucium secundum edidere nomen: in omnia superbi Pontifex creabatur
(writes Balaeus) Interim novum Romani tumultum excitaverunt, in opposition to
the Popes Supremacy; etenim Senatoribus quos instituerant, non contenti,
Patricium Celsioris magistratum fastigii adjecerunt, ac vectigalia omnia tam
urbana, quam peregrina Pontifici erepta ei attribuerunt. Pontificemque sacris
decimis et largitionibus dignitatem tueri suam jusserunt, Ea dignitas delata
trimum est ad Jordanem Petri Leonis filium, hominem in urbe vetere nobilitate
ac populari gratia potentissimum. Quas actiones Lucius primum blanditiis
impedire contendit, deinde inanes eas expertus vim adhibendam putavit. Itaque
postero ineunte Anno (1145.) Lucius a Romany propter hoc vehementer
exagitatus, supplex per Legatos Conradum Imperatorem in Italiam vocabat, sed
Conradus aliunde impeditus, illuc venire non poterat, nec ejus tunc inservire
tyrannidi. Lucius ergo ex alia via rem comparandam ratus, exp^ctabat donec
semel essent Senatores omnes cum Patricio in Capitolio congregati ut de rebus
suis consultarent, tunc exercitu co^ parato Senatores in Capitolio obsedit
(Papaliter factum) ordinem illum, qui libertatis Romanae erat fundamentum
cupiens vel omnino^ per^ere, vel saltem expellere. Quo apparatu cognito
Jordanes Patricius cum majori manu occurrit, populusque ad arma cucurrit,
commissoque praelio ipsum Pontificem cum suis a Capitolio repulit. Lucius
militio i^^mixtus lapidibus and ^axis ita est quassatus (so little did the
people esteem his Papacy or Sanctity) ut neque amplius usque ad diem obitus
sui, qui proxime consecutus est, in ^olio Pontificio consedisset, primo nondum

obtain the name and office of a Legate, which some write he missed, but William
Thorn assures us he obtained from Pope Lacius, who by his special Bull
confirmed the agreement made between H^gh Abbot of St. Augustine and his
brethren, and Theobald Archbishop of Canterbury, concerning an annual rent due
to the Archbishop from the Monastery, which was composed at Rome, by this Pope,
who ratified the Liberties of the Monastery and Church of Canterbury.

exp^dire, ut ex suo coll^gio quisquam in Pontificem eligeretur, cum ita jus
Libertatis a Romany civibus quaeratur. Bernardi quoque cr^brescentem famam,
multum (...) suam facere putabant; atque si ejus di^cipulum elig^rint,
praeceptoris authoritatem, auxilium and consil^um nunquam defuturum suis
desideriis sperabant. Nec eos feseliit spes subdola; auxit enim Bernardus
quantum potuit Romani Pontifics authoritatem. As soon as St. Bernard heard of
this elect on, being a plain-hearted man, he writ this chiding Epistle to the
Cardinals and Bishops for making such an unfitting choice. Epist. 236. ad Omnem
Curiam Romanam quando eligerunt Abbatem Sancti Anastasii in Papam Eugenium.
Dominis and Patribus venerandis, Cardinalibus and Episcopis omnibus qui sunt de
Curia, puer Sanctit itis eorum. Parcat vobis Deus; quid fecistis? Sepultum
hominem revocastis ad homines; fugitantem curas et turbas, cur denuo
implicuistis, et immiscuistis turbis? fecistis novissimum primum, et ecce
novissima illius periculosiora prioribus: Crucifixus mundo, per vos revirit
mundo; and qui elegerat abjectus esse in domo Dei sui, ipsum vos in Dominum
omnium elegistis. Cur consilium inopis corfudistis? Cur pauperis hominis and
mendici and compuncti cord judicium perturbastis? Currebat been: Quid vobis
visum est sepire vias ejus, avertere semitas, gressus involvere? Quasi
descenderet de Jerusalem, et non magis ascenderet de Hiericho, sic incidit in
latrones: et qui se (tanquam violentis quibusdam) Diaboli manibus, carnis
illecebris, et gloriae seculi potenter excusserat, non tamen valuit effugere
manus vestras. Number idcirco Pisam deseruit ut reciperet Romam? Number qui in una
Ecclesia non sustinuit Vicedominatum, dominatum in omni Ecclesia requirebat?
Quid igitur rationis vel consilii habuit defuncto summo Pontifice, repent
irruere in hominem rusticanum, latenti injicere manus, et excussa e manibus
securi et ascia, vel ligone, in Palatium trabere, levare in Cathedram, induere
purpura et bysso; accingere gladio ad faciendam vindictam in nationibus,
increpationes in populis; Psalm. 149
ad alligandos Reges eorum in compedibus, and Nobiles eorum in manicis ferreis?
Sic non erat inter vos sapiens et exercitatus cui potius ista convenirent?
Ridiculum profecto videtur, pannosum homuncionem, assumi ad praesidendum
Principibus, ad imperandum Episcopis, ad regna et imperia disponenda. Ridiculum
an miraculum? Plane unum horum. Non nego, non diffido posse fuisse hoc etiam
opus Dei, Psalm. 118
qui facit ni^abilia magna solus; praesertim cum audiam usquequaque ex ore
multorum, quoniam a Domino factum est istud. Sed nec ego oblitus sum judiciorum
Dei antiquorum, and Scripturae plurimos recensentis, ex privata seu etiam
rusticana vita olim assumptos in voluntatem Domini ad regendum populum ejus.
Denique, nonne (ut unum e pluribus memorem) taliquodammodo elegit David servum
suum, and suscepit eum de gregibus ovium, de post fetantes accepit eum? Ita
inquam, ita and de nostro Eugemo in beneplacito Domini potuit contigisse: Non
sum securus tamen, quoniam filius delicatus est, and tenera verecundia ejus
assueta potius ocio and quieti, quam tractandis quae foris sunt; tremendumque
ne non ea auctoritate qua oportuerit, sui Apostolatus officia exequatur. Quid
putatis gerere animi nunc hominem illum, qui de secreto internae
contemplationis, and amica sollicitudine cordis, tanquam infans e gremio and
sinu matris subito perturbatus, tractum se ad medium videt, and quasi ovem ad
victimam ductum ad tam insueta et insuavia? Nisi Dominus supponat manum suam,
heu necesse est obruatur, et opprimatur onere insueto et nimio; quod et
gygantinis (ut aiunt) vel ipsis quoque angelicis humeris formidabile videatur.
Veruntamen quia sic factum est, and sicut multi dicunt, a Domino sactum est;
vestra interest carissimi vestris ferventibus studiis fidelibusque obsequiis
solicit confoveri, quod vestris manibus constat elaboratum. Si qua ergo
consolatio in vobis, si qua virtus charitatis in Domino, si qua miseratio
pietatis, si qua compassionis viscera, assistite and collaborate illi in opere
in quo assumptus est per vos a Domino. Quaecunque sunt vera, quaecunque pudica,
Phil. 4. 8.
quaecunque justa, quaecunque sancta, quaecunque amabilia, quaecunque bonae
famae, haec ei suggerite, haec suadete, haec agite; and Deus pacis erit
vobiscum.

He likewise writ another elegant Epistle to Pope Eugenius himself; Epistola
237.
Amantissimo Patri and Domino Dei gratia Summo Pontifici Eugenio, etc. Quia
tamen semel coepi lequor ad Dominum meum: jam enim filium dicere non audeo,
quia filius in patrem, pater mutatus est in filium: Qui post me venit, ante me
factus est; sed non invidio, quia quod mihi deerat in eo me habere confido, qui
non solum post me, sed etiam per me venit. Nam si dignaris quodammodo per
Evangelium ego te genui. 1 Cor. 4. 14.
Quae est ergo spes nostra, Psalm. 76.
and gaudium nostrum, and corona gloriae? Nonne vos ante Deum? Denique, filius
sapiens gloria est patris. Genesis 17.
Amodo tamen non vocaberis filius, Mar. 3.
sed vocabitur tibi nomen novum, Acts 13.
quod os Domini nominavit. Haec est mutatio dexterae excelsi, and multi in
mutatione ista gaudebunt. Nam quemadmodum olim Abram in Abraham, Jacob in
Israel, and ut de tuis magis praedecessoribus tibi proponam: sicut Simon in
Caepham, Saulus in Paulum: sic filius meus Bernardus in patrem meum Eugenium,
laeta prorsus, and utili, 1 Reg. 2.
ut speramus, translatione promotus est. Digitus Dei est iste, suscitans de
pulvere Egenum, Psalm. 110.
and de stercore erigens pauperem, ut sedeat cum Principibus, and solium
gloriae teneat. 2 Cor. 2.
Superest ut facta hac mutatione tui, ipsa quoque quae tibi commissa est Domini
tui sponsa mutetur in melius, and jam nequaquam Sarai sed Sara de caetero
nominetur. Intellige quae dico. Dabit enim tibi Dominus intellectum. Si amicus
Sponsies, ne dixeris, dilectam ejus Principem meam, sed Principem, nil tuum in
ea vendicans, Mat. 20.
nisi quod pro ea si oportuerit etiam animam dare debes. Joan. 10.
Si Christus te misit, aestimabis te non ministrari, sed ministrare venisse,
and ministrare non solum substantiam, sed ipsam quoque animam, 2 Cor. 1. 24.
sicut praefatus sum. Verus Successor Pauli dicet cum Paulo; Non quia dominamur
fidei vestrae, sed adjutores sumus gaudii vestri; Petri haeres, audiet Petrum
dicentem, 1 Pet. 5. 3.
Neque ut dominantes in Clerum, sed forma facti gregis; sic enim jam non
ancilla, sed libera etiam and formosa speciosissimi sponsi per te in
desideratos asciscetur amplexus. Alioquin per quem alium haec tam debita
libertas sperabitur, si and tu (quod absit) in Christi haereditate quaeras quae
tua sunt, qui jam and ante ediceras non dico tua non retinere, sed nec tuus
esse? Ergo fiduciam talem habens in te, qualem in nullo praedecessorum tuorum,
a multis retro temporibus visa est habuisse, exultat merito ubique and
gloriatur in Domino Omnis Ecclesia Sanctorum, and specialiter illa cujus
uternus te portavit, and cujus ubera tu suxisti. Quid ergo, Nonne and mihi
licet gaudere cum gaudentibus? Nunquid non ero unus de numero laetantium? Psalm.
2.
Exaltavi fateor, sed cum tremore. Exultavi, sed in ipsa exultationis meae
articulo, tunor et tremor venerunt super me. Ego enim et si nomen patris
deposui, sed non timorem, sed non axietatem, postremo nec affeclum, nec viscera
patris. Considero gradum, et casum vereor: Considero fastigium dignitatis, et
intueor faciem abyssi jacentis deorsum. Attendo celsitudinem honoris, et e
vicino periculum reformido, pro eo quod scriptum est; Psalm. 48.
Homo cum in honor esset non intellexit. Quod quidem ad causam magis quam ad
tempus arbitror esse referendum, ut sic intelligatur dictum, Cum in honor
esset non intellexit; ac si diceretur, honor aborbuit intellectum: Et quidem
elegeras abjectus esse in domo Dei tui, and recumbere in novissimo loco in
convivio ejus; sed placuit dicere ei qui te invitavit, Lu. 14.
Amice ascend superius. Itaque ascendisti in altum, Noli altum sapere, sed
time, ne forte contingat sero miserabilem illam emittere vocem, Romans 11.
A facie irae and indignationis tuae, elevans allisi^ii me. Altiorem quippe
locum sortitus es, sed non tutiorem; sublimiorem, non securiorem; Psalm. 101.
Teribilis prorsus, Exodus 3.
terribilis est locus istae. Locus, inquam, in quo stas, terra sancta est;
locus Petri est, locus Principis Apostolorum, ubi steterunt pedes ejus. Locus
illius est quem constituit Dominu Dominum domus suae, and principem omnis
possessionis suae. Si forte declinaveris a via Domini, sepultus est in eodem
loco, ut sit ibi contra te in testimonium. Merito tali Pastori, tali nutritio
commissa est Ecclesia cum adhuc tenera, adhuc in cunabilis esset, cujus docta
magisterio, and exemplo educata omnia terrena calcaret, utpote qui excusserat
manus suas ob omni munere, qui dicebat de cord puro et conscientia bona, Acts
3. 6.
Argentum and autum non est mihi. Haec hactenus. Caeterum causa quare ante
tempus scripserim vobis, haec est. Wintoninesis Episcopus, and Eboracensis
Archiepiscopus non gradiuntur uno Spiritu cum Cantuariensi Archiepiscopo, sed
incedunt sibi ex adverso, and haec vetus est de legatione quarela. Veruntamen
quis est ille, and qui sunt illi? Nonne Eboracensis ipse est cui te praesente
cum adhuc esses quasi unus ex nobis fratres tui restiterunt in faciem, eo quod
reprehensibilis erat? Gal. 2.
Sed speravit in multitudine divitiarum suarum, and praevaluit in vanitate sua.
Certum est tamen, quod non intravit per ostium in ovile ovium, sed ascendit
aliunde: Joan. 10.
si Pastor fuisset, diligendus erat; si mercenarius, tolerandus; Nunc autem
cavendus and repellendus utpote fur and latro. Quid dicam de Domino
Wintoniensi? Opera quae ipse facit testimonium perhibent de eo. Porro
Archiepiscopus Cantuariensis cui adversantur vir religiosus est, and
suaveoentis opinionis. Pro ipso petimus ut respondeat ei Justitia sua. Ezech.
18.
Verum illorum iniquitas super eos, ut sit sicut scriptum est, Justitia justi
super eum erit, and impietas impii erit super eum. Cum acceperis tempus
secundum opera manuum illorum retribues illis, ut sciant Prophetam esse in
Israel. Quis mihi det antequam moriar videre Ecclesiam Dei sicut in diebus
antiquis, quando Apostoli laxabant retia in capturam; non in capturam argenti
vel auri, sed in capturam animarum? Quam cupio illius te haereditare vocem,
Acts 8.
cujus adeptus es sedem, Pecunia, inquit, tua, tecum sit in perditionem. O vox
tonitrui! O vox magnificentiae et virtutis! ad cujus terrorem confundantur et
convertantur retrorsum omnes qui oderunt Syon. Hoc vehementer expectat, et
omnino expetit a te matter tua; hoc filii matris tuae pusilli cum majoribus
desiderant, hoc suspirant, ut omnis plantatio quam non plantavit Pater
coelestius tuis manibus eradicetur. Ad hoc enim constitutus es super gentes and
regna, Jer. 1. 10.
ut evellas, and destruas, and aedifices, and plantas. Multi audito hoc verbo,
dixerunt apud se, Jam securis ad radicem arborum posita est; Multi dicunt in
cord suo, Mat. 3. 10.
Flores apparuerunt in terra nostra, tempus amputationis advenit, in quo
sarmenta sterilia recidentur, ut ea quae praevalent uberius fructum afferant.
Confortare igitur and esto robustus, manus tuae in cervicilus inimicorum
tuo^um. Vindica tibi a^mi constantia, and vigore spiritus partem quam dedit
extra fratres tuos tibi omni^^ eus Pater, quam and tulit de manu Amorei in
gladio and arcu suo. In omnibus tamen operibus tuis memento te esse hominem, et
timor ejus qui aufert Spiritum principum semper sit ante oculos tuos, Three of
them dying within the space of one year.
Quantorum in brevi Romanorum Pontificum mortes tuis oculis asperisti? Ipsi te
praedecessores tui, tuae certissimae et citissimae decessionis admoncant, et
modicum tempus dominationis ^^rum paucitatem dierum tuorum nunciet tibi. Iugi
proinde medi^^tione inter transcuntis gloriae blandimenta, memorare novil^ma
tua, quia quibus successisti in sedem ipsos sine dubio sequeris ad mortem.

This Epistle of St. Bernard was seconded with sundry others, but especially
with 5. sever^ elegant Books De Consideratione, dedicated to Pope Eugenius,
wherein he earnestly pressed him to the serious consideration and discharge of
his Pastoral duty, which was not a Domination or Dignity, but a work and
Ministry, wherein he should ^^udy to profit, not to preside over others;
discovering unto him the manifold abuses, corruptions of the Popes, Court of
Rome, their Officers and proceedings under former Popes, which he exhorted him
diligently to reform.

Anno 1145, 1146, and 1147. upon sad tidings from the Holy I and, that the
Saracens on the night of Christ's Nativity, (...)
by the treachery of some Christians, had entered the Temple of Jerusalem,
sla^n the Archbishop and Clergy ministering in the Temple, subdued all
Mesopotamia, and endangered the loss of all the Holy ^and and Kingdom of
Jerusalem; Pope Eugenius by his Bulls, and Saint Bernard by his Epistles and
Sermons, excited the Emperor and most Christian Kings and Kingdoms to take up
the Cross and arms against them, granting him the same large indulgences for
this service, as Pope Urban had done before them; Omnibus inde rebus, quae a^
causam orientalem pertinebant, satis, ut tum potuit, constitutis; the Romans
mutining against the Pope to recover their ancient Liberties, he thereupon
being greatly incensed, resolved to be avenged of them; atque armis (a Popelike
argument) ad pristinum Ecclesiae studium^ obsequiumque reducere statuit. Itaque
Lucii exemplo, hand molli rem agendem brachioratus, Tiburtes, caeterosque Latii
populus, quorum caussa adeum furorem Romani venerant, ad arma sollicitavit,
atque ipso; little open Romanos invasit. Romani cum per aliquot dies acerrime
restitissent, tandem tectorum eversionem, patriae fortunarumque amissionem
extimescentes, pacem petierunt, ea^que demum his conditionibus impetrarunt, ut
Patricium abrogarent, Praefectum restituerent, Senatores ex Pontificia
authoritate tencrent, et Arnoldum turbarum concitatorem urbe ejicerent.
Hisrebus transactis Eugenius in Vrbem revertit, populo, Cleroque faullis
vocibus, Benedictum esse, qui veniret in nomine Domini, Sigonius l. 11. See
Abbas Uspergensis, and Cent. Magd. 12 c. 9. col. 1174, 1175.
concinente. After which, Anno 1246. Romani seditionem redintegrantes, rursus
ab Engenio ut Tibur everteret, postularunt. Quare diserte negata, usque adeo
exasperati animis sunt, ut se ni quod peterent i^ petrarent, vim adhibituros
o^tenderent. Itaque Eugenius consilio cum Cardinalibus habito rursus Urbe cum
eis cedere statuit, ac pedum pulvere ad terrorem injiciendum in eos excusso
trans Tyberim, una cum Cardinalibus, populo ipso telis missilibusque eos
hostiliter incessente, atque inde Tybur contendit. Hac re audita Bernardus ad
populum Romae literas ob^urgationis plenas has scripsit.

Nobilibus and Optimatibus, Bernardi Epist. 242 f. 224 Ad Romanos quande
discesse^unt a Domino Papa Eugenio.
atque Vniverso populo Romano frater B. Clarevallis vocatus Abbas, Declinare a
malo, and facere quod bonum est. Sermo mihi est ad te popule sublimis and
illustris cum sim vilis exiguaque persona, ac nullius pene momenti homuntio. Id
quidem verecundum atque onerosum mihi consideranti, quis quibus scribam,
simulqu^ quam aliter hoc alius indicare possit, sed levius reor verecundia apud
homines periclitari, quam condemnari apud Deum silentio, very taciturnitate and
absconsione justitiae, etc. Communis est causa, and non est distinctio pusilli
and magni. Dolor nempe in capite est, ac per hoc minime alienus, ne a minimis
quidem vel extremis quibusque corporis partibus, nec a me. Pervenit profecto
usque ad me, quamvis omnium minimum dolor maximus istesqui maximus est) and
quod cum sit capitis non potest non esse and corporis, cujus membrum sum ego:
Nunquid non dolente capite clamat lingua pro omnibus corporis membris, in
capite se dolere; omnia per ipsam suum caput suumque capitis fatetur
incommodum. Dimittite proinde, quaeso dimittite, ut plangam paululum apud vos
dolorem meum, nec meum tantum, sed and totius Ecclesiae. Nonne ipsius vox est
hodie per universum mundum, Caput meum doleo, caput meum doleo? Quis namque vel
novissimus Christianorum in toto sit orb qui non glorietur hoc capite, quod
ambo illi gloriosi principes terrae alter amisso, alter submisso in cruce
capite, suo t^iumpho extulerunt, suo sanguine ornaverunt? Ad omnem itaque
spectat Christianum injuria Apostolorum, and sicut in omnem terram exivit sonus
eorum, sic laesio eorundem ab omnibus usquequaque sentitur, usquequaque
plangitur, and doletur. Quid vobis visum est, O Romani, offendere Principes
Mundi: Psalm. 1^.
vestros autem speciales patronos? Cur Regem terrae, cur Dominum coeli, furor
tam intollerabili, quam irrationabili in vos pariter provocatis, dum Sacram and
Apostolicam sedem divinis regalibusque privilegis singulariter sublimatum, au^u
sacrilego incessere, suoque minuere honor contenditis, quam vel soli contra
omnes si oportuisset defendere debuistis? Sic fatui Romani non judicantes,
neque quod honestum est di cernentes, caput vestrum atque omnium, quod in vobis
est, detur^atis, pro quo magis nec vesiris ipsis cervicibus parcendum a vobis
foret, si necessitao exegisset. Patres vestri urbi orbem subjugaverunt, vos
urbem properatis orbi facere fabulam. En Petri haeres, Petri sede, et urbe a
vobis expulsus est: en rebus et domibus suis vestris manibus spoliati sunt
Cardinales atque Episcopi Ministri Domini. O popule stulte et insipiens! O
Columba seducta non habens cor! Nonne ille Caput, Osee 7.
et illi oculi tui erant? Quid ergo nunc Roma nisi sine Capite truncum corpus,
sine oculis frons effossa, facies tenebrosa? Aperi Gens misera, aperi oculos
tuos, and vide desolationem tuam iam^amque imminentem. Quomodo in brevi mutatus
est color optimus, facta est quasi vidua domina Gentium, Princeps Provinciarum:
Verum initia malorum sunt haec graviora timemus. Nunquid non prope interritum
es si persistis; Revertere, Revertere Sunamitis, revertere ad cor tuum; agnosce
jam vel sero quae quanta, a quibus patiaris vel passa sis. Recordare qua causa,
quo fine, per quos and in quos usus, non long ante hos dies cunct^rum quae in
te sunt Ecclesiarum, omnis ornatus et census profligatus est, quicquid in
Altaribus et in Altarium vasis, quicquid in ipsis sacris imaginibus Auri et
Argenti reperiri nunc potuit, manibus impiorum direprum et asportatum est. Quid
ex his omnibus tu in tuis nunc marsupiis invenis? Porro decor domus Domini
irr^cuperabiliter periit, and nunc quid tibi visum est iterare malitiam,
innovare denuo super te dies malos? Quid modo vel lucri amplioris vel certioris
spei arridet tibi? nisi quod in eo novissima tua cernuntur incautiora
prioribus, quod tunc quidem non solum multi de pl^be, sed etiam de Clero and
Principibus nonulli per orbem in Schismate illo faverunt tibi. Nunc vero sicut
manus tuae contra omnis, sic manus omnium contra te. Mundus est a sanguine tue
mundus omnis praeter te sol^m, and filios tuot qui in te sunt. Vae ergo nunc
tibi popule miserande, and vae duplo quam ante, non ab exteris nationibus, non
feritate Barbarorum, non a millibus armatorum. Vae tantum a facie tuorum, tibi
vae a domesticis and amicis, a clade intestina, a cruciatu praecordiorum, a
tortionibus viscerum. Agnoscis ne jam, quod (...) omnes pacifici qui domestici,
nec omnes amici qui videntur? Et si alias noveramus, sed nunc part manifestius
edocemur omnem veritatem illius sermonis Domini quam dixit, quoniam inimici
hominis domestici ejus. Mich. 7.
Vae fratri a fratre in medio tui, and filiis a parentibus. Vae non a gladiis
sed a labiis iniquis, Mat. 10. 36, 37.
and a lingua dolosa. Usquequo male in malo vos alterutrum confortatis, and
Gladiis labiorum invicem sternitis, invicem perditis, ut ab invice consumamini.
Congregamini oves dispersae, redite ad pascua, redite ad Pastorem et Episcopum
animarum vestrarum. Redite pravaricatores ad cor; quod loquor non quasi hostis
convicians, sed quasi amicut objurgans. Habet vera amicitia nor nunquam
objurgationem, adulationem nunquam, sed iungimus and obsecrationem. Obsecramus
pro Christo reconciliamini Deo, 2 Cor. 5. 1^.
reconciliamini Principibus vestris (Petrum loquor and Paulum) quos utique in
Vicario et Successore suo Eugenio suis sedibus et aedibus effugastis;
Reconciliamini inquam orbis Principibus, ne forte incipiat pro eis pugnare
orbis terrae contra insensatos. An nescitis quia his offensis nihil omnino
valetis; his propitiis, nihil omnino timetis. Non, inquam, non timebis sub
horum tutela millia populi circumdantis te, Urbs inclyta, Civitas fortium.
Reconciliare proinde illis simul and millibus martyrum, qui quidem apud te, sed
contra te sunt propter grande peccatum quod peccasti, inquo and persistis.
Reconciliare etiam omni Ecclesiae Sancterum qui ubique terrarum aeudito hoc
verbo scandalizati sunt. Alioquin pagina ista contra te, in testimonium erit,
sed and ipsi Apostoli and Martyrs tui stabunt in magna constantia adversus eos
qui se angusti verunt, Sap. 1.
and qui abstulerunt labores eorum, Sed jam finem loquendi omnes pariter
audiamus. Annunciavi justitiam praenunciavi periculum, veritatem non tacui,
hortatus sum ad meliora; superest ut aut de vestra citius correctione laetemur,
aut de justa imminenti damnatione certi inconsolabiliter lugeamus arescentes
and tabescentes prae timore and expectatione quae supervenient universae Vrbi.

The Romans notwithstanding this Letter persisting obstinately in their
Oppositisition against Eugenius, Sigonius, l. 11 p. 279.
to cast off his Papal Usurpation over them; this Pope thereupon, veterum
Pontificum exemplo, in Franciam ire constitutit, ut absentia desiderium sui
Romany efficeret; accordingly he retired into France to avoid the fury and
treachery of the Romans, and that principally by St. Bernards persuasion, who
gave him this black Character of them. Bernardus de Consideratione lib. 4. f.
242, 243.
Quid de populo loquar? Populus Romanus est. Nec brevius potui, nec expressius
tamen aperire de tuis Parochianis quod sentio. Quid tam notum seculis, quam
protervia et fastus Romanorum? Gens insueta paci, tumultui assueta; Gens
incivilis et intractabilis usque, adhuc subdi nescia, nisi cum non valet
resistere. En plaga; tibi incumbit cura haec; dissimulare non licet; Rides me,
forsitan fore incurabilem persuasus; Noli diffidere, curam exegeris, non
curationem. Denique audisti, curam illius hab; and non cura vel sana illum.
Verum dixit quidam, Non est in medico semper relevetur ut aeger, etc. Quem
dabis mihi de tota maxima urbe, qui te in Papam receperit precio, seu spe
precii non interveniente? Et tunc potissimum volunt dominari, cum professi
fuerint servitutem. Fideles se spondent, ut oportunius fidentibus noceant. Ex
hoc non erit consilium tibi, a quo se arcendos putent, non secretum, quo se non
ingerant, Si stante prae foribus, quoquam illorum moram vel modicam fecerit
ostiarius; ego tunc pro illo esse nolo. Et nunc experire paeuci^; noverim ne
and ego vel aliquatenus mores gentis. Ante omnia sapientes sunt ut faciant
mala, bonum ante facere nesciunt. Hi invisi terra and coelo, utrique iniec^ere
manus, impii in Deum, temerarii in Sancta, seditiosi in invicem, aemuli in
vicinos, inhumani in extraneos, quos neminem amantes amat nemo; and cum timeri
affectant ab omnibus, omnes timeant necesse est; Hi sunt qui subesse non
sustinent, praesse non norunt, superioribus infideles, inferioribus
importabiles. Hi inverecundi ad petendum, ad negandum frontosi. Hi importuni ut
accipiant, inquieti donec accipiant, ingrati ubi acceperint. Docuerunt linguam
suam grandia loqui cum operentur exigua. Largissimi promissores, and parcissimi
exhibitores. Blandissimi adulatores, and mordacissimi detractores,
simplicissimi dissimulatores, and malignissimi proditores, Excurrimus usque
huc, before te atque expressius ad monendum putantes horum quae circa te sunt
in hac part; jam ad ordinem recurramus.

St. Bernard perceiving the Romans to persist obstinately in their Rebellion
against Eugenius, whom they forcibly expelled, without hopes of any amicable
reception of him by Letters or mediation, endeavored to stir up the French
King and other Princes to restore him, and reduce the Romans by force of arms
to obedience both to the Pope and Emperor; to which end he writ this memorable
Epistle to Conrade King of the Romans, evidencing the Emperors and Kings
Supremacy in causes Ecclesiastical, that the defense, care of the Church and
Religion, belongs primarily to them, not the Pope, and that Rome was the head,
Inheritance of the Empire, though the Sea of the Papacy.

Bernardi Epistola, 243. f. 225.
Ad Conradum Regem Romanorum. Nec dulcius, nec amicabilius, sed nec artius
omnino Regnum Sacerdotiumque conjungi, seu complantari in invicem poterunt,
quam ut in persona Domini ambo haec pariter convenirent, utpote qui factus est
nobis ex utraque tribu secundum carnem, Summus and Sacerdos and Rex; non solum
autem, sed et commiscuit ea nihilominus, ac confederavit in sue corpore, quod
est populus Christianus, ipse caput illius, ita ut hoc genus hominum Apostolica
voce, 1 Pet. 2.
genus electum, regale Sacerdotium appelletur. In alia quoque scriptura, Apoc.
1.
quotquot sunt praedestinati ad vitam, No^ne omnes Reges and Sacerdotes
nominantur? Ergo, Matthew. 1^
quae Deus conjunxit, Homo non separet: Magis autem quod divina sanxit
authoritas, humana studeat adimplere voluntas, and jungant se animis, qui
juncti sunt institutis. Invicem se foveant, invicem se defendant, invicem onera
sua portent. Ait Sapiens, Eccles. 4. 9. 11
Frater ad^uvans fratrem, ambo consolabuntur. Gal. ^. 25.
Quod si alterutrum se (quod absit) corroserint and momorderint, nonne ambo
desolabuntur? Non veniat anima mea in consilia eorum qui dicunt, vel Imperio
pacem et libertatem Ecclesiarum, vel Ecclesiis prosperitatem et exaltationem
Imperii nocituram; Non enim utriusque institutor Deus in destructionem ea
connexuit, sed in aedificationem. Si hoc s^^is, quousque vos communem
contumeliam, communem dissimulatis injuriam? Nonne ut Apostolica seeds, ita et
caput Imperii Roma est? Ut ergo de Ecclesia taceam, number honor Regi est truncum
in manibus tenere Imperium? Et quidem ignoro quid vobis super hoc consulent
Sapientes vestri and Principes Regni; sed ego in insipientia mea loquens quod
sentio, non tacebo. Ecclesia Dei ab exortu su^, usque ad haec tempora pluri^s
tribulata est, and pluries liberata est, Psalm. 128.
(to wit, by Christian Kings an^ Emperors) Denique, audite quid ipsa de se
loquatur in Psalmo; Ipsius enim vox est; Saepe expugnaverunt me a juventu^e
mea, etenim non potuerunt mihi: supra dorsum meum fabricaverunt peccatores,
prolo^ gaverunt iniquitatem suam. Psalm. 124.
Certus esto, O Rex, quod nec nunc qu^que relinquet Dominus Virgam peccatorum
super sortem justorum. Esa. 59.
Non est abbreviata manus Domini, nec facta impotens ad salvandum. Acts 20.
Liberabit and hoc tempore absque dublo sponsam suam qui suo sanguine redemit
eam, suo spiritu dotavit, donis caelestibus exornavit, ditavit nichilominus and
terrenis. Liberabit inquam, Liberabit; sed si in manus alterius, viderint Regni
Principes, id ne honor Regis, regnive utilitas sit; non est utique. Quamobrem
accingere gladio tuo super femur tuum potentissime, et restituat sibi Caesar
quae Caesaris sunt, Nota.
et quae sunt Dei Deo, Vtrumque interesse Caesaris constat, et propriam tueri
Coronam, et Ecclesiam defensare; Alterum Regi, alterum convenit Ecclesiae
advocato. Victoria sicut in Domino con^idimus prae manibus est; Superbia and
arrogantia Romanorum plus quam fortitudo eorum. Quid enim? Nunquid quispiam
magnus vel potens verbi gratia, Imperator aut Rex, faedam Rem istam in Imperium
pariter Sacerdotiumque praesumit? Sed Populus hic maledictus, and tumultuosus;
qui suas nescit metiri vires, cogitare sinem, considerare proventum,
insipientia sua, furore suo ausus est hoc grande sacrilegium attentare. Absit
ut vel ad momentum stare possit ante faciem Regis popularis manus, vulgi
temeritas. Factus sum insipiens, qui cum sim vilis ignobilisque persona,
tanquam aliquis magnus consiliis tantae magnitudinis, tantaeque Sapientiae me
ingessi, and de re magna. At quo ignobilior, atque objectior, tanto liberior
sum ad loquendum quod Charitas suggerit: Unde and adhuc, addo in eadem
ins^pientia mea; Si quis aliud quam locutus sum vobis, quod non credimus,
suadere conabitur is profecto, aut non diligit Regem, aut parum intelligit quid
Regiam deceat Majestatem, aut certe quae sua sunt quaerit, et non valde quae
vel Dei vei Regis sunt curare convincitur. This Pope at last by St. Bernards
solicitation and the assistance of Conrade, and Ludovicus King of France, was
restored to the possession of his See at Rome.

In the mean time whiles Engenius remained in France, the Emperor Conrade
apprehended that St. Bernard had done something in derogation of the Empire and
his Prerogative; whereupon he writ this short Epistle to him, to acquit
himself from this accusation.

Querimoniae Regis nostrae sunt, Ad Con^adum Regem Romanorum, Epist. 183.
and maxim illa quam dignanter exprimitis de invasione Imperii; Regis dedecus,
Regni diminutionem nunquam volui; Volentes odit anima mea: Legi quippe, Omnis
anima potestatibus sublimioribus subdita sit, Romans 13.
Et qui potestati resistit, Dei ordinationi resistit. Quam tamen sententiam,
cupio vos and omnimodis moneo custodire, in exhibenda reverentia Summae and
Apostolicae Sedi, and beati Petri Vicario, sicut ipsam vobis vultis ab universo
servari Imperio.

Pope Eugenius intending to hold a General Council at Rhemes in France, the
French King conceiving it might derogate something from his Prerogative and
right of his Crown, intended to prohibit it: hereupon St. Bernard writ this
Epistle to persuade him to permit this Council to sit; promising that the Pope
should correct and reform any thing wherein he had exceeded his Jurisdiction,
to his prejudice, wherein he would assist him.

est; quasi nos glacilia corpora habeamus; An corda nobis magis congelata sunt,
and nemo est qui juxta Prophetam, Compatiatur super contritione Joseph. Amos 6.
Sed haec alias. Nunc autem ego minimus in regno vestro sed dignitate, non
fidelitate, dico vobis, non expe^it velle impedire tantum and tam necessarium
bonum. Nec desunt evidentes causae quibus id manifestum facere possem, quas and
nunc proferre in medium ad manum mihi est; nisi quod sat arbitror dictum
Sapienti. Tamen si quid ex Apostolicae auctoritatis rigore processit, unde se
merito esse turbatam Celsitudinis vestrae Serenitas arbitratur; qualiter hoc
ipsum revocetur, aut temperetur, prout oportet ad honorem vestrum, fideles
vestri qui adherent totis viribus enitentur. Inter nos quoque, si quid
possumus, non dissimulabimus. The design of this whole Epistle imports; 1. That
the Pope himself could not then summon any Council in France, without the Kings
special royal license, authority, and conviction of the grounds and necessity
thereof. 2ly. That he had power to prohibit any Council to assemble in his
Realm, if held by the Pope himself without his license and approbation. 3ly.
That if the Pope did or had done any thing by his Decrees, or Papal authority,
to the Kings offense, or prejudice of his honor, all his loyal Subjects and
Clergy were obliged to endeavor to revoke and moderate it.

Regno Italiae, lib. 11. p. 277.
beyond expectation of all men, became more courageous, Papal, and apt to
govern the Sea of Rome then was imagined, whence Sigonius observes; Eugenius
ubi primum est designatus, contra opinionem omnium ingentem animi indolem prae
se tulit. Nam cum a Romany ad remittenda urbis vectigalia urgeretur, eos ita
aspernatus est, ut ne dignos quidem, queis cum habitaret, putarit. Itaque urbe
statim egressus ad Monasterium Farfense se contulit, eoque Cardinalibus
evocatis novo instituto, ibi consecrationem accepit, atque inde aspectum
pervicacis populi devitans, arce S. Angeli Petri Leonibus tradita, Viterbium se
recepit. Sub eosdem dies Arnoldus Haereticus ex Germania in Italiam reversus,
captato Romanae seditionis and Pontificiae absentiae tempore, in Urbem se
conjecit, ac seditioni per se satis ardenti majores quoque faces admovit,
populum ad vetera majorum instituta, factaque imitanda gravi inprimis, ac
praesentibus temporibus oportuna oratione adhor^ans, qui senum consilio, et
juvenum manu totum sibi terrarum orbem subjecissent, reaedificandum Capitolium
ac Senatores, Equitesque Romanos renovandos, inclamans administrationem urbis

homines and amici Siculi, excepto Jordano nostro vestri studiosissimo,
Ptolemaeus quoque and alii plures nos oppugnant, ne vobis Imperialem Coronam,
ut convenit imponainus. Quare oramus ne iniquis de Senatoribus, nobisque
sermonibus credatis, vestrumque nobis auxilium denegetis, sed primo quoque

respuit, sic contra Guid^^em Pi^^num Cardinalem, aliosque qui a Pontifice missi

then appealed to the Emperor Conrade, as their superior Lord.

How much the Popes, Bernardus de Consideratione ad Eugeninium, l. 4. f. f. 242.
Cardinals, and Court of Rome were degenerated from their pristine Usage of
preaching and seeking the salvation of the peoples souls, through worldly Pomp,
Pride, Ambition, St. Bernard thus complained to Eugenius himself, without hopes
of reformation, Quia non placebit Satrapis, plus Majestati, quam veritati
faventibus. 2 (...). 12.

Non quaerentes quae sua sunt, sed impendentes; impendere curam, impendere
substantiam, Luke 1.
impendere and seipsos. Unde unus illorum, Et ego (ait) superimpendar pro

Et tanquam dicerent, non venimus ministrari sed ministrare, ponebant quotiens
opportuisset sine sumptu evangelium. Vnus erat de Subditis quaestus, una pompa,
unaque voluptas, si quomodo eos possent parare Domino plebem perfectam. In
omnimodis satagebant, etiam in multa contritione cordis and corporis, in labor
and aerumna, in fame and siti, in frigore and nuditate. Vbi nunc quaeso
consuetudo haec? subiit dissimilis valde, long in aliud mutata sunt studia, et
utinam non in pejus. Cura tamen and anxietas, and aemulatio and sollicitudo
fateor perseverant. Translata haec, non imminuta. Testimonium vobis perhibeo,
quod nec substantiae parcitis, non magis quam ante. Diversa autem locatio
dissimilitudinem facit. Magna abusio, pauci ad os Legislatoris, ad manus omnes
ressiciunt, etc. Quale est quod de spoliis Ecclesiarum emuntur, qui dicunt tibi
Euge, euge? Pauperum vita in plateis divitum seminatur, Argentum micat in luto,
accurritur undique, tollit illud non pauperior sed sortior, aut qui forte
citius pr^currit. Ate tamen ^os iste, vel potius mors ista non cepit, in te

In his 3d. Book, he has this memorable discourse concerning the great abuse,
grievance, vexation of Appeals to the Court of Rome, which he pressed Eugenius
seriously to consider and redress.

Bernardus de Consideratione l. 3. f. 240, 241.
Annon limina Apostolorum plus jam ambitio, quam devotio terit? An non vocibus
ejus vestrum toto die resultat Palatium? Annon quaestibus ejus tota legum
Canonumque disciplina insudat? Annon spoliis ejus omnis Italica inhiat
inexplebili aviditate rapacitas? Quid ita tua ipsius spiritualia studia non
saltem intercidit, sed abscidit, quotiens sancta and faecunda tua abortiri otia
fecit inquietum, and inquietans malum? Aliud est quod ab oppressis appellatur
ad te, aliud autem quod ambitio in Ecclesia per te regnare molitur. Nec de esse
illis, nec huic aliquatenus assentire opus. Quam vero inique fovetur illa,
spernuntur illi, utrisque tamen debtor es; illis ut erigas, istis ut reprimas.
Et quoniam incidit de Appellationibus, prosequi aliquatenus non erit ab re.
Magno in his and pio opus intuitu est, ne quod magna fuit necessitate provisum,
male utendo reddatur inutile. Michi videtur and in multam posse eas devenire
perniciem, si non summo moderamine actitentur. Appellatur de toto mundo, ad te
quidem in testimonium singularis primatus tui. At si tu sapis, non primatu
gaudebis, Luc. 4.
sed fructu. Apostolis dictum est, In hoc nolite gaudere quod Spiritus
subjiciuntur vobis. Appellatur ad te, ut dixi, et utinam tam f^uctuose, quam
necessary. Vtinam cum oppress us clamat, sentiat oppressor, et non superbiat
impius unde incenditur pauper. Quia e regione tam perversum, tam recti alienum,
ut laetatur qui malum fecit, et qui tulit inaniter fatigetur? Inhumanissime non
moveris erga hominem cui illatae injuriae cumulavere dolorem, and labor
itineris, and damna expensarum. Sed nichilomunus ignavissime in illum non
moveris, qui huic tot calamitatum partim author, partim extitit causa. Evigilia
homo Dei, cum haec contingunt, moveatur miseratio, moveatur and indignatio tua;
Alteram laeso, alteram laedenti debes. Consoletur ille damnorum resarcitu
suorum, satisfactione injuriarum, fine calumniarum. Cum isto ita agatur ut
poeniteat fecisse, quod non timuit facere, and non de poenis innocentis rideat.
Arbitror idem debere p^ti illum qui sine causa forte appellavit. Formulam hanc
justitia praefigit tibi, and divinae incommutabilis ratio aequitatis, and ni
fallor ipsa Appellationum lex, ut illicite usurpata appellatio, nec prosit
appellanti, nec appellato obsit: ut quid enim frustra fatigatus sit homo? Quam
plenum justitiae, ut sese potius ^aeserit qui voluit proximum? Appellasse
inique iniquum est, inique et impune iniquarum Appellationum fomes. Iniqua
autem omnis appellatio, ad quam Iustitiae inopia non coegit. Appellare non ut
graves, sed si graveris licet. Appellandum a sententia: ante sententiam improve
omnino, nisi ob manifestum gravamen praesumitur appellatio. Qui igitur non
gravatus, appellat, liquet, quod aut gravare intendit, aut tempus redimere. Non
est autem suffragium appellatio, sed refugio^. Quantos novimus appellasse
pulsatos, quo interim liceret quod nunqua^ licet? Nonnullis etiam quod vixerunt
licuisse appellationis suffragio nefaria scimus; Verbi gratia, incestum,
adulterium. Quale est hoc turpitudini patrocinari, quod vel maxim formidari a
turpibus oportebat? Quousque murmur universae terrae aut dissimulas, Nota.
aut non advertis? Quousque dormitas? quousque non evigilat consideratio tua ad
tantam appellationum confusionem, atque abusionem? Praeter jus et fas, propter
morem et ordinem fiunt. Non locus, non modus, non tempus, non causa
discernitur, aut persona. Praesumuntur leviter passim, plerunque et nequiter.
Vole^tes malignari nonne his potissimum terreri solebant? Nunc terrori ipsi er
his magis fiunt atque id bonis. Antidotum versum in venenum: non mutatio
dexterae excelsi haec. Appellantur boni a malis, ut non faciant bona; et
supersedent a voce tonitrui tui formidantes. Denique, appellantur Episcopi, ne
illicita audeant Matrimonia solvere, vel prohibere. Appellantur, ne rapinas, ne
furta, ne sacrilegia et quae ejusmodi sunt punire ullatenus, vel cohibere
praesumant. Appellantur, ne indignas et infames personas a sacris officiis
beneficiisve repellere, seu amovere queant. Quod tu invenis remedium morbo
huic, ne quod repertum ad remedium fuit, reperiatur ad mortem? zelatus est
Dominus domum orationis factam speluncam latronum; Tu ejus Minister dissimulas
miserorum refugium; datum arma iniquitati. Videas praeripi passim parts
oppressorum, et prorumpere ad appellandum, non tam gravatos, quam gravare
volentes: Quid hoc mysterii? Tuum est considerare, non meum commentari istud.
Et eur, inquis, male appellati non veniunt ostensuri suam innocentiam, malitiam
convicturi? Dico quod dicere ad hoc solent. Nolumus vexari frustra; In curia
esse qui proclivius faveant appellantibus, fovean^ appellationes. Cessuris
Romae domi cedere satius. Fateor me non omnino decredere his. Quem das mihi in
tam crebris appellationibus quae hodie fiunt, qui pro expensis itineris, vel
nummum restituerit illi quem forte appellarit? Mirum vero si ita omnes et
appellantes justi, et appellati rei vestro examine inventi sunt. Sap. 1.
Diligite, inquit, justitiam qui judicatis terram. Parum est justitiam tenere,
nisi et diligas. Qui tenent, tenent, qui diligunt zelantur, Mich. 6. 8.
Amator Justitiae inquirit (...), and prosiquitur eam. Porro omnem justitiam
prosequitur. Nihil tibi et illis, qui appellationes venationes putant. Pudet
Elogii, quod apud Ethnicos jam vertitur in Parabolam, duos movimus cervo^.
servos pingues, ut mitius loquar, plus facetiae quam justitiae hic; Tu si amas
justitiam, appellationes non affectas, sed sustines. Veruntamen quid emolumenti
affert Ecclesiis Dei tua unius hominis justitia, ubi sententia praevalet aliter
affectorum? At istud loci illius erit cum coeperint versari qui circa te sunt.
Nunc vero non te existimes ociose vacare considerationi huic, qua appellationes
ad legitimum si fieri potest revoces usum. Et si hinc mea quaeratur vel potius
curetur sententia, dico Appellationes ut non contemnendas, sic nec usurpandas
omnino. Porro horum quid insolentius censeam haud facile dixerim, nisi quod
usurpatio quandam videtur inducere contemptus necessitatem, ac per hoc forte
acrius insectanda quia amplius noceat: Aut non vere nocentior est mala in se,
in partu pejor? Nonne ipsa est quae ipsum jus quoque naturae, aut extenuat at
exterminat? Nam saepe rebus etiam preciocissimis, precii gratiam non modo
demit, sed adimit. Quid Sacramentis acceptius? usurpata tamen ab indignis,
indigneve tractata, minime acceptantur. Magis habent damnationem, quia debitam
venerationem non habent. Fateor, grande et generale mundo bonum esse
appellationes; idque tam necessarium, quam solemn ipsum mortalibus. Revera
quidam sol Justitiae est, procedens ac redarguens opera tenebrarum; prorsus,
fovendae and manutenendae sunt; sed quas extorsit necessitas, non calliditas
adinvenit: Vsurpatoriae sunt hujusmodi omnes, non subvenientes in necessitate,
sed opitulantes iniquitati. Quid ni veniant in contemptum? Quanti ut talibus
quoque deferrent etiam de proprio cessere jure ne longo et casso itinere
fatigarentur? Plures tamen sua amittere, non ferentes Appellationes minus
oportunas, et celsa nomina importunius contemserunt. Dico aliquid quod ad rem
pertinet, exempli causa* Quidam sibi public desponsaverat uxorem, adest dies
celebris nuptiarum, (...) omnia, invitati multi, and (...) concupiscens uxorem
proximi sui (...) appellationis inopinatae prorumpit affirmans, sibi traditam

progredi: (...) omnes apparatus ille, descendit quisque in donum suam coenam
manducaturus; Sponsa a mensa et thalamo sponsi suspenditur, quousque Roma
reditum est; Parisiis contigit hoc nobili Galliarum Civitate sede Regia. Rursum
in Civitate eadem, quidam sibi desponsata Uxore diem, (...): Interim emergit
calumnia, dicentibus quibusdam, non de bear conjungi. Ad judicium Ecclesiae

sine gravamine, solo frustratoriae disationis (...) perdere quae pararat, sive
dilectae camdiu frustrari consortio (...) quod proposuerat, contempta sive
dissimulata Appellatione peregit. Quid illud quod in Antisiodorensi Ecclesia
nuper a quodam adolescentulo praesumptuim est? Nempe defuncto Sancto Episcopo
volentibus Clericis alium, ut (...) est eligere sibi, intervenit ille
appellens, et vetans ne sieret quousque isset et redisset ab urbe: Cui tamen
Appellationi nec ipse detulit. Number cum videret se contemni tanquam qui
irrationabiliter appellasset, accitis qu^s (...) die post factam ab aliis
electionem, fecit suam. Cum itaque ex his and innumeris talibus liqueat, Nota.
non ex contemptu gigni usurpationem, sed ex usurpatione contemptum, videris tu
quid sibi velit quod Zelus vester assid^e pere vindicat illum, istam
dissimulat. Vis perfeciicus co^rcere contemptum? Cura in ipso utero pessimae
matris praefocari Germen nequam, quod ita siet si usurpatio digna
animadversione mulctetur. Toll usurpationem et contemptus excusationem non
habet. Porro inexcusabilitas ausunm explodet. Non sit proinde Vsurpator, et
contemptor nullus erit, aut admodum rarus. Been facis tu, quod appellationum
negato suffragio, imo suffugio, multa remittis negotia ad cognoscentes, vel qui
noscere citius possunt. Ubi enim certior ac facilior notio, ibi decisio tutior
expeditiorque esse potest. Quam plenum Gratiae, quam multorum quoque per hoc
and laboribus parcis and sumptibus? At quibus sic credas id tibi omnimodis
attendendum. Poteram multa de eodem utiliter addere his, sed memor praepositi
mei contentus interim occasionem dedisse.

After this he thus censures the Avarice and Bribery of the Pope and Court of
Rome, (...) Et primum quod occurrit minime transeundum reor; Praees, et

I shall add his Notable passage of complaint against this and other Popes
frequent exemptions of Abbots, Bishops and others (for money) from subjection
and obedience to their Superiors; by subjecting them immediately to the Pope
himself: because his arguments against them hold as firmly in cases of Popes
exempting themselves, and absolving Bishops, Clergymen, or Lay-subjects from
allegiance and obedience to their Princes: and gives a notable check to the
pretented plenitude and absoluteness of the Popes will and power to do what he
pleases.

Christiana utique Philosophia, non decere nisi quod licet; non expedire, nisi
quod decet, and licet; non tamen omne quod licet dicere aut expedire consequens
erit. Age, aptemus si possumus tria ipsa aperae huic. At quomodo non indecens

exercere, negligere rationem? Tunc major Domino tuo qui ait; Non veni facere

Quanquam non minus dejecti quam clati animi est veluti rationis expertem, non
pro ratione, sed pro libitu agere, nec judicio agi sed appetitu. Quid tam
bestiale? et si indignum cuivis utenti ratione vivere ut pecus, quis in te
rectore omnium tantam contumeliam naturae, honoris injuriam ferat? Sic
