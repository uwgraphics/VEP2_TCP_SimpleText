AN ODE UPON HIS Majesty's Birthday, Set to Music by Dr. Staggins; and
Performed before Their MAJESTY'S, November the 4th. 1693.
The Words by N. Tate, Servant to Their Majesty's.
SOund a Call, the Tritons sing,
Summoned by their Vocal Shells,
From Coral Beds and Crystal Cells,
Up the joyful Nereids spring;
Sound a Call the Tritons sing.
What makes Neptune's Court appear,
Circled on a dancing Wave?
The Day's arrived, it is come, it is here,
That Birth to CAESAR, Joy to Europe gave.
See the Sacred Quire descending,
Earth and Sea your Song attending;
Crown the Day that Crowns the Year.
'Twas NOW, the threatening Tempest past,
We saw his Welcome Anchors cast,
Flags displayed, and Streamers free
As what they brought us, Liberty.
Liberty the Sailors cried,
Liberty the Shores replied.
Successor of Great Hercules,
When will thy Labors, when thy Dangers cease?
Thy Courage and thy Toils
Have long deserved Nemaean Spoils.
Why are Thy Triumphs then retarded?
Why such Virtue Unrewarded?
Chor.
The Promised Blessing's but Delayed,
With greater Interest to be Paid.
Mighty Births, in Teeming longest,
Make amends for their Delay:
Shades of Night are ever strongest,
Just before the Break of Day.
Gallick Force in vain is striving,
Gallick Fraud in vain contriving,
Hope and CAESAR still surviving.
Drooping Europe's State to Raise,
And yet assure Successful Days,
Undaunted CAESAR Fights, Devout MARIA Prays.
CHORUS.
'Twas Constancy could only prove
Alcides the true Son of Jove;
Heads of Hydra still Renewing,
And the Hero still Subduing;
Till with Unwearied Valor pressed,
At last the Monster fell, the World at last had Rest.
