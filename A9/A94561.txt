TO THE MEMORY OF THOMAS HENEAGE ESQUIRE.
An Expostulation with DEATH.
IS there no remedy, must wise men die
As well as fools? has perfect Piety
No privilege beyond Impiety?
Impartial Death, when will thy poisoned dart
Learn to distinguish 'twixt the Nobler part
Of living men, and those whose vulgar breath
Were far a fitter sacrifice for death?
Why are the Stars immortal more than they?
They shine by night, these glister night and day.
Stars borrow all their light, but wisemen lend:
In each of them the world enjoyes a friend.
How is it then that senseless creatures be
Exempted from this general tyranny,
And fixed within their Orbs, survive to light
So many Worthies to eternal night?
Is it because Stars are above the Spheere,
Wherein thou art allowed to domineere?
Or is thy arm too short, or will thou say
The night revives them that depart by day;
That every Even beholds a dying Sun,
And every Morn a Resurrection?
Oh happy world, if wise and virtuous men,
Since they must die, might die to live again
After some hours like Sol, or with the Moon
After some days; if that be thought too soon,
That like the fragrant flowers they might appear
To beautify the Earth but once a year;
Then happily we might our selves inure
His death with some more patience to endure,
Whose grace and wisdom did trascend by far
The light and influence of the Morning Star.
But this vain wish the Great and only Wise
Controller of the Universe denies,
And 'twill become us better, reverently
To mourn in silence, rather than reply.
The Epitaph.
HEre lies interred under this fat all Stone
A world of men epitomis'd in one.
London, printed for Edward Blackmore, 1642.
