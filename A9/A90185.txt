LONDON. Printed in the Year, M.DC.XL.IX.

A DECLARATION Of his Excellency, the Right Honorable, JAMES, Marquess of
Ormond, Earl of Ormond, and Ossary, etc.
IT has always been the observed practice of wicked Men, (as skillful
Physicians guild over their most bitter Pills, and deliver their unpleasantest
Potions in a delightful Cup) to lay a fair outside, upon their foulest
actions, and make a plausible entrance into their most execrable designs;
writing the sense of their black resolutions in golden Characters, wrapping
their most nefarious Plots in mantles of Innocence; and traducing others,
transfer their own guile, to make it become their guiltiness: whilst good
men knowing innocence, to have so fair a face, that she needs no painting; and
a good Cause, when plainly told, to be sufficiently pleaded; in confidence of
their own integrity and honesty, commit their Cause (in a plain dress,
without any other ornament than truth) to the view of the world; presuming
their Resolutions to be grounded on so good reason, that they cannot want the
equity of a candid and charitable construction; which, their malicious
Adversaries with cunning sophistry endeavor to asperse by wounding their
reputations with scandalous slanders, and charging their honors with heinous
accusations; casting false fires before the eyes of the Vulgar, benighted with
ignorance, depraving the senses with unjust suspicions of ancient and approved
Government, and charm them to a cheerful embracing of their garish novelties:
whereby at length themselves become Lords of their Persons and judgments, and
enslave both to the pleasures of their tyrannical wills, making themselves
perfect Observers of the first part of that good advise, Be wise as Serpents,
and leaving the innocence of Doves to the only practice and portion of their
injured Adversaries.

Such was the condition of His late sacred Majesty of ever blessed memory, who
in the beginning of these unhappy differences, being sufficiently satisfied of
the candor of His own heart, and justice of His Cause, freely Declared His
resolutions for the satisfaction of all His People; neglecting nothing that
might beget and preserve a good understanding between Him and His Subjects; in
giving many Princely testimonies of His grace and favor, in passing several
Acts, to the abridging of His Royal Prerogative for the enlargement of their
Liberties: Notwithstanding which, these bloody Catalines, His Enemies, as if
they had put on a resolution not to be satisfied with any thing but His
Majesty's destruction; did by secret and subtle practices, bespatter His
Majesty's reputation, possessing the People with feigned Fears and Jealousies,
whispering to their abused senses, strange imaginations, that His Majesty did
exdeavour to alter the Religion established, and introduce Popery; to subvert
the fundamental Laws of the Land, and to alienate the Peoples Liberties into
the French bondage; whereby their Estates should become liable to His Will and
pleasure: by which, they begot a misunderstanding between the KING and His
People; which having fully effected, for the further advancing of their own
ambitious ends, they plunged the People into a most barbarous and bloody
Rebellion against the KING'S Sacred Person, His Crown and Dignities, and for
the better color of their mischievous intentions, they make a show of
Reformation, and under pretense to abolish Superstition, they have banished all
decency out of the Church; using the reverence of Religion, as a mantle to
cover their impiety, blasphemy, Treason, Sacrilege and Rebellion, and that
they might show themselves Graduates in Machiavel's Politiques, and with better
skill delude His Majesty's wel-meaning Subjects, besides their Oath of
Allegiance, Protestation, and several Declarations, they cause a Solemn
League and Covenant to be generally taken within their Quarters, whereby with
hands lifted up to the most high God, they bind themselves to maintain the
true Protestant Religion, to preserve His Majesty's Royal Person, Queen, and
Posterity, in the fullness of their glory and splendour, with the continuance of
His Majesty's just and Royal Prerogatives, that they would always maintain
the Privileges of Parliament, and the Liberty of the Subject; by which fair
and specious pretenses they won the People, (who usually fathom the mysteries
of State by their own shallow capacities) to a ready compliance with them; who
thought neither Life nor Estate too precious to be hazarded in their service:
by whose assistance, having got the grand Treasury of the Kingdom into their
custody, wanting neither Men nor Money, they prosecute their Design with all
rage and violence, to the plunder and ruin of all that did oppose them, not
sparing the lives of any who seemed to stand as screens between them and their
purposes: but at length, having subdued the Loyal Party, and got His Majesty's
Royal Person into their possession, after a long and tedious Imprisonment,
wherein all the common comforts of this life were withheld from Him, (save the
peace of a good Conscience, which they could not sequester:) In the time of a
Treaty, the Faith of the Kingdom being passed for His security, when He had
granted the perfection of their desires, and given them all possible
satisfaction, when the hopes of peace, and the general conceit of His
Majesty's safe return had swollen the Peoples hearts to an hyperbole of
happiness, even then to show, that nothing would satisfy them but Blood and
Dominion, they abruptly break off the Treaty, and by Force of Arms, hurry Him
from one Prison to another, till at length they bring Him before the Judgment
Seat, where having laden Him with scorn and contempt, and upbraided with the
infamous brands of Tyrant, Traitor, and Murderer; they dismissed Him with the
Sentence of Death: And that they might justify the Gun-powder-Traytors, who
having some tincture of Grace, contrived their Treason to be secretly acted in
a Cellar, as blushing, that the light should be a witness of their prodigious
deeds: These, as an addition of His sorrow, in a triumphant manner, with Drums
beating, and Colors flying, on the 30. Jan. 1649. (a black and dismal day!)
they bring his sacred Majesty to the Scaffold, where without respect of Place
or Person, either of the Repres^ntor, or Represented, at mid day, in the face
of the Sun, and general view of His People, they execute their grim, and
bloody Sentence by the common Executioner, who to the terror of the Beholders,
with his Instrument of death, separated His Royal Head from His Body; whom
malice it self could not justly stain with any notorious personal fault,
being a King of high and ancient descent, full of all Imperial virtues,
Religion, Justice, clemency, patience, learning, wisdom, memory, affability,
magnanimity, and all other high and glorious endowments that are requisite for
the perfect accomplishment of an absolute KING. And albeit, that Princes hold
their Crowns immediately of, and from God, by right of lawful Succession and
Inheritance, inherent by Royal Blood; yet by force of Arms they keep His
present Majesty from His undoubted Right, and absolve the People from their due
Allegiance and fealty to their lawful Sovereign, Declaring, and solemnly
proclaiming throughout the Kingdom, That they will absolutely abolish
Monarchy, and perpetuate the Government to themselves and their posterity in a
confused Anarchy.

And now I cannot but declare, that from my soul I do abhor, and utterly
detest, that execrable and prodigious murder which was executed upon the Person
of my late dread Sovereign; which was a Treason of that horror, and monstrous
nature, (as was excellently expressed by a learned Lawyer in case of the
Gunpowder Treason) that before now, the tongue of Man never delivered, the ear
of Man never heard, the heart of Man never conceited, nor the malice of hellish
or earthly Devil ever practiced: For, if it be abominable to murder the least,
if to touch Gods Anointed be to oppose themselves against God, if by blood to
subvert Princes, States, and Kingdoms be hateful to God and Man, as all true
Christians must acknowledge; then how much more than monstrous must all Men
judge the horror of this Treason, to murder and subvert such a KING; to race
out such a Progeny, to overthrow such a Government, so complete and absolute,
that God approves, the world admires, all true English hearts honor and
reverence, and only the Pope and his Adherents, themselves and their Abettors
envy and malign.

Nor can I leave hear, having to do with offenses so exorbitant and
transcendent, and aggregated of so many bloody and fearful crimes, as they
cannot be aggravated by any inference, argument, or circumstance whatsoever,
being of the first impression, and therefore without any Name, which might be
adaequate sufficient to express it, given by any Legist, that ever made, or
writ of any Laws: For, the highest Treason, that all they could imagine, they
called it only, Crimen laesae Majestatis, the violating of the Majesty of the
Prince: but this Treason does want an apt name, as tending not only to the
hurt, but to the death of the KING, and not to the death of the KING only, but
of His whole Kingdoms, that is, to the destruction and dissolution of the
whole frame and fabric of the ancient, famous, and ever-flourishing Monarchy;
even the deletion of our whole Name and Nation.

For repairing and restoring the honor whereof, for bringing these high and
capital Delinquents to due and impartial justice, for the restoring the true
Protestant Religion to its ancient splendor, the establishing His Majesty's
Thrones in power and peace; for the maintenance of the ancient Privileges of
Parliament, the Law of the Land, and Liberty of the People, and (I take God to
witness) for no other end, by virtue of His Majesty's Commission I have taken
up Arms, and do solemnly protest in the presence of Almighty God, that I will
never lay them down, while God shall enable me to hold them up; till I have
fully finished my intended work, and reduced all in rebellion to His Majesty's
obedience.

Nor shall any prosperous success in my Adversaries, or adverse, in my self,
discourage me, in prosecution of my resolved enterprise; not being any thing
amated at my late unhappy fortune before Dublin; (where I was betrayed by my
new modelled Soldiers; which Defeat, was not yet so great as my Enemies
pretend, nor their loss so small, as themselves would persuade) but shall
speedily return to that Siege, from whence I resolve not to depart, till it
shall please God to deliver that City up into my hands; not doubting but by
Gods assistance in a small time, to turn their triumphant Festival of
Thanksgiving, into a day of Humiliation.

And for as much as mercy, is the surest foundation whereon a King can
establish his Throne, I declare, that I shall always become an importunate
Intercessour, to His Majesty, to receive all such to mercy, as shall humbly
submit themselves, and acknowledge their offenses, and that all convenient
Liberty may be granted to the ease of Tender Consciences; and that all such may
be received to pardon, who have been deluded, and drawn away by the subtle
insinuations of the crafty Adversary, and have been only Spectators or Abettors
of that horrible Murder; and that indemnity may be granted to all save those
that have been principal and grand Actors in that monstrous and prodigious
Treason, who can expect no pardon.

And whereas by credible information I am given to understand, that OLIVER
CROMWELL, with a numerous Army, lies now at Milford, intending to make a speedy
entrance into this Kingdom, to join with those, now in rebellion against His
Majesty; to the dissipation of this Army under my command, and promotion of the
Rebels interest here: Wherefore I declare, that I am so far from being any
whit daunted at the noise of their numbers, that my encouragement is swollen to
a full measure, not only with the sense of my ability to encounter them; but
my assured confidence, that (by Gods assistance) we shall utterly destroy them
and their rebellious Host.

And I do further declare, that I am fully resolved, and do hereby command
all Officers and Commanders, both in Field and Garrison, not to capitulate with
any of them, upon any terms save in the language of the Sword: but upon all
occasions to fight it out, to the last Man. Nor do I make any doubt, but that
I shall be able to give a speedy account of this City and Kingdom, which I hope
shortly to reduce to His Majesty's obedience: And I am confident, that the God
in who^ we trust, will be the Tower of our defense, and as we own his Cause,
so he will own us for his own; and as from nothing he gave us a beginning,
and from a small beginning, has made us a powerful Army, and given almost all
the strong Garrisons in the Kingdom into our possession, causing our Enemies
to become our Friends, so he will now deliver up these our proud and implacable
enemies into our hands, making them and the world to know, that he is our God,
and we his People. And now with this comfort I shall conclude, that maugre the
malice, power, and fury of those insolent Regicides our Enemies, this present
design, in which I am engaged, shall altogether tend to the glory of God, the
honor of our Religion, the Safety of his most Excellent Majesty, and the
Royal Family, the security of His Kingdoms, the extirpation of Errors, and
suppression of Rebellion; and I doubt not but my progress herein shall be
continually attended with the blessing of God, and the prayers of the Church.

From our Rendezvous near Dublin, August the 11th. 1649.
