The Resolution of the Gentry of Lincoln, in setting forth 168. Horse, whose
names are subscribed.
WHereas both the Houses of Parliament have Voted a necessity of putting the
Kingdom into a posture of War, for the suppressing of any Insurrection
within, or Foces from without; and have (by their example and acceptance of
others offers to maintain Horse and Foot armed for that purpose) given us,
whose Names are here under written, occasion (considering the present
distractions amongst us) to undertake to maintain and have in readiness such
number of Horse furnished fit for War, as we do here subscribe to, for the
maintenance and defdnce of his Majesty's just Prerogative, the Protestant
Religion, as it is now estab^ished; the Laws of the Realm, the just
privileges of Parliament, and the public peace, against all opposition
whatsoever: And the said Horse to be disposed of within the County for three
months after the 20. of this instant July; at suchtime, and in such way as his
Majesty shall by his Commission direct.
