To the Reader.
Christian Reader,
THis Industrious and Judicious Author, does here present thee with two
distinct Tractates concerning the Christian Sabbath, or Lords Day: In the
former, the Divine Institution of it is clearly proved; In the latter, the time
of its beginning is particularly determined. In the former, the erroneous
conscience, which denies the morality of the fourth Commandment, is strongly
convinced: In the latter, the scrupulous conscience, which doubts of the time
when the Sabbath begins, is fully satisfied.

In both, the serious Reader will find great profit and delight; The whole
Discourse being illaborate and perspicuous, wherein besides the main points
intended in it, diverse other matters of important Cognizance are occasionally
decided, and discussed, and many obscure Scriptures are excellently explained
according to the genuine sense thereof.

And this learned Discourse has its birth in a very seasonable time, in
respect of that woeful defection and Apostasy that is among us, as from the
truth and ways of God in general, so in a special manner from the Religious
esteem and observation of the Lords day.

For never since the light of the blessed and glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ
shined upon this our Goshen, was the Sabbath Day so wickedly neglected and
profaned by the generality of people, and the Divine Institution thereof so
shamefully denied, and decried by many pretenders to Religion, as it is at this
day.

And therefore (Good Reader) we heartily commend this necessary and useful
work to thy diligent perusal, and thy self, and thy humble and sincere
inquiries after Truth, unto the guidance and blessing of the God of all Truth.

To the Reader.
IF our Testimony be of any weight with the Judicious Reader, and may
contribute any thing to encourage his perusal of this Book, we have to signify
upon that acquaintance we have had with it, that we judge it very worthy the
publishing and perusing: both for that in the former part it does strenuously
plead for the morality of the Sabbath; and in the latter part gives occasion to
learned Brethren of a contrary apprehension to consider whether they have not
reason to captivate their judgments to the Authors, as touching the beginning
and ending of the Sabbath.

A Table of the chief Heads.
CHAP. I. PRoving by five Reasons, That Adam fell on the day of his Creation.
Reason 1. Because Moses joyneth man's Creation, Trial, Judgment, and Promise,
to the same day Page 1 R. 2. Because he fell at the very first instant that
ever he eat any thing p. 5 R 3. Because Adam being created after God in
wisdom, would not in wisdom have omitted to have eaten of the Tree of Life in
the very day of his creation, if the Devil had not first circumvented him by
the unseen subtilty of his Temptation p. 6 R. 4. Because the Devil had not
deserved the name of a subtle Serpent if he had left Adam at liberty to eat of
the Tree of life but one whole day together p. 8 R. 5. Because the Woman fell
while she was a Virgin p. 21 The time of the Fall of the Angels (now called the
Devil) was when they were commanded to attend upon Adam and Eve, at their first
entrance into Paradise p. 10 The true nature of the first Covenant stood in
obedience, or disobedience, not to a moral, but to a positive command p. 12 The
Devil knew the operation of the forbidden fruit better than Adam and Eve could
do as long as they stood in their unconfirmed Innocence p. 15
CHAP. II. Proving by three Reasons that Adam was Re-created in the same day in
which he was created and fell p. 23 Reason 1. From the order of Gods dealing
with him immediately after his Fall p. 23 R. 2. From the now name Hevah, Life,
which he gave to his wife p. 26 R. 3. From the word Enmity which God put into
her as a holy qualification against the Serpent that had deceived her p. 28 The
cool of the day in Genesis 3. when God came to examine Adam, was about Mid* day*
p. 23
CHAP. III. Proving, by a double Inference, that Adam and Eve were Re-created
before the seventh day p. 30 1 Drawn from the word Host and Finished, in Genesis
2. 1. p. 34 For if all the Host of Heaven and Earth were finished before the
seventh day, then it follows that Adam and Eve were Re-created before the
seventh day p. 34 2 Drawn from the word Had made, in Genesis 2. 2. p. 35 For if
God had made something in the sixth day that needed a new finishing act before
the seventh day, as the Text speaks, then what can that finishing act else be
but Adams Re-creation by the Promised Seed? p. 35 Adam in his Innocence could
not so well honor all his Creators as after his Fall and Re-creation p. 37 The
Mystical, as well as the Natural Creation was made and finished before the
seventh day, and therefore Adam and Eve were Re-created before the seventh day
p. 39 The Creation of the Humane Nature of Christ, was the perfection of the
whole Creation, in the latter part of the sixth day p. 39. 46
CHAP. IV. God could not said to keep a perfect Rest on the seventh day, until
he had put out sundry opperations of his Eternal Providence for the finishing
or perfecting of that work which he had made but mutably perfect in the
forepart of the sixth day p. 42
CHAP. V. This term [which he had made] in Genesis 2. 2. has relation to the
Creation of the Mediator, in two particulars. 1 In regard of his office, God
created him to be a Mediatorial Priest, before he could keep a perfect rest on
the seventh day p. 46 2 In regard of his Humane Nature, he was virtually made
flesh of the Seed of the Woman before God could keep a perfect Rest on the
seventh day p. 46* 39

CHAP. VI. Proving, that the whole World was made for the honor of the
Mediator, as the right Heir of it all p. 50 And hence it follows. 1 That God
could not keep a perfect Rest on the seventh day, until he had put the
Mediator as the right Heir of all into his possession. 2 Hence it follows, that
Adam must fall, and be Re-created also on the day of his Creation, before the
Lord could keep a perfect Rest on the seventh day. p. 50

CHAP. VII. Proving, that Gods Rest on the seventh day was such a perfect Rest,
that nothing could happen afterward that could any whit lessen, or d^sturb the
perfection of his Rest on the seventh day, as it would have happened, if God
had kept a Sabbath of Rest whiles Adam stood in a mutable condition p. 54
CHAP. VIII. That the true nature of Gods Rest on the seventh day was his sweet
content in the Mediator p. 55, 56 All the Trinity rested, and were refreshed on
the seventh day, because they had perfected man's happiness by a Re-creation p.
57
CHAP. IX. Proving, that God blessed the first seventh day with many sorts of
spiritual Ordinances, such as were apt to convey spiritual and eternal
blessedness to fallen man p. 59 God would never have blessed the seventh day
with spiritual Ordinances, if the Mediator had not been declared to fallen man
before the seventh day p. 60 God did not leave Adam and Eve to spend the first
seventh* day in private speculations, but he blessed the first seventh day with
variety of Ordinances, both for public and private use, for their best
spiritual good p. 60 God commanded Adam to preach every seventh day, either
upon his miserable Fall, or else upon the riches of Gods grace for his recovery
by the Promised Seed* p. 62 God commanded Adam to join the duty of Prayer to
the duty of Preaching p. 63 Jesus Christ taught Adam by the Sacrifice of a
Lamb, how he should be the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world p. 65
Two persons, where no more can be had, may be called a true Church of Christ,
and may exercise Gods Ordinances after a public manner p. 68 The dis-regarding
of the Sabbath, and the Ordinances thereof is the high way to all Profaneness
and Apostasy* p. 70 Private duties are commanded on the Sabbath days, as
necessary Handmaids to the public p. 72
CHAP. X. Showing after what manner God did sanctify the first* seventh day p.
73 1 By ordaming it to be the separated time of his public and private
worship. 2 By ordaining it to be as a sanctified sign of his Rest, and of man's
resting on the Seed of the Woman for the breaking of the Devils Head-plot, by
the work of his Redemption and Reconciliation p 73 When ever God did sanctify
any thing for man's use, he did by that act command man to separate that thing
to the Lords use p. 74 When God did sanctify the first seventh day, he did
thereby command Adam to prepare himself for the better sanctifying of the said
seventh day p. 75
CHAP. XI. Showing that God did sanctify the outward Rest of the seventh day
to be a typical sign both of his own Rest, and of man's Resting on the Seed of
the Woman, for the breaking of the Devils Head-plot for man's Redemption* p 78
Our Redemption from Satan's Head-plot was the finishing act* of the whole
Creation; and therefore it was the true reason of Gods Rest, and of hi^
commanding Adam to rest on the first seventh day p. 82
CHAP. XII. Showing that God did make the first seventh day famous by honoring
the number Seven ever after with famous respects p. 85 1 By contriving the
Typical Ceremonies of our Redemption very often into the number of Seven,
doubtless in an honorable memorial of the first famous seventh day p. 86 2 By
marking out diverse rare and eminent holy persons by the number Seven p. 89 3 By
contriving several parcels of the Scripture Chronology into the number Seven,
doubtless in an honorable remembrance of the first famous seventh day p. 93
CHAP. XIII. Proving, That though Christ has abolished the Seventh Day by his
death, yet he has not left the day of his public worship Arbitrary to
particular Churches, to appoint what day they please in the place of the
seventh day, as some unadvised Protestants do affirm* p. 94 And that Christ
Jesus has made three main changes in the ten Commandments, p. 99
CHAP. XIV. Proving by several other particular grounds that Christ himself did
appoint the day of his Resurrection for the exercise of his public worship in
the place of the seventh day, p. 101 Things Remarkable. 1 Touching the number
eight, three things are remarkable, p. 113 2 That four Sabbaths did meet
together* and succeed each other at the Death and Resurrection of Christ, ibid.
3 The Resurrection of Christ was made famous by three remarkable days, p. 114

CHAP. XV. Propounding some reasons why the Apostles did allow of the
Jewish-Sabbath, or seventh day in their Synagogues for a time after it was
abolished by the Death of Christ, as well as of the Lords day in Christian
Churches, p. 116 The opposition which some believing Jews made in Christian
Churches for their not obs^rving the Jewish Sabbath, does fully prove that the
Christian Churches had cast off the Jewish Sabbath, and that they observed the
Lords Day in the place of it* p. 118
CHAP. XVI. Being an Answer to several Questions. Q. 1. Whether Christians
under the Gospel are bound to observe the Lords Day as strictly from all work*
and as holily in the practice of all duties of Religion as the Jews were to
observe the Sabbath day? p. 129 Hence this Question is moved, Whether it be
lawful to begin to solemnize a Marriage upon the Sabbath? Answered no. p. 130
Q. 2. Might not the Jews kindle afire on the Sabbath day to dress necessary
food? Answered Yes. p. ibid. Q. 3. To the same purpose; Answered p. 132 Q. 4.
To the same purpose; Answered p. 134 Q. 5. Are Christians bound to rest as
strictly from all Works, and Re-creations on the Lords day, as the Jews were on
the Sabbath day? Answered, Yes. p. 135 Q. 6. Were Re-creations on the Sabbath
day punished by the Magistrates among the Jews with the same kind of
punishments that working on the Sabbath was? Answered No. They used differing
kind of punishments p. 136 Also that Magistrates are bound to punish the
profanation of any part of the Lords day (whether it be by work, or re*
creation) either by scourging, or else by some Mulct that is equivalent p. 137
Q* 7. Did not the Jews hold it lawful to do works of mercy* or of present
necessity upon the Sabbath day? Answered* Yes p. 139

THE PREFACE.
MAny do affirm that the Sabbath was ordained in the time of Adams Innocence:
But I shall endeavor to prove that it was not ordained till after Adams Fall
and Recovery.

And this I shall endeavor to make evident by proving these two points.

I That Adam disobeyed and fell in the same sixth day in which he was created
and made. II That God did recover Adam by a new creation, even in the same
sixth day in which he was created, and fell.


CHAP. I.
Proving, by five Reasons, that Adam Fell in the day of his Creation.

Reason 1.

MOses does manifestly declare that Adam fell in the day of his Creation,
because he joyneth Because Moses joyneth Adams creation, trial, judgment, and
promise, to the same day.
the story of his Temptation and Fall in Chapter 3. close to his Creation, and
seating in Paradise, in Chapter 2. without mentioning of any other matter to
come between.

Object. Here it may be objected, that Moses does first set down the story of
Adams creation, in Genesis 1. and then he does set down the Institution of the
Sabbath in the beginning of Genesis 2. 2, 3. which is in order of time before the
story of Adams Temptation and Fall, in Chap. 3.

Answ. Though Moses does place the Institution of the Sabbath, in Genesis 2. 2* 3*
before the story of Adams fall; yet it is evident that he does place it there
only by the figure Hysteron Proteron (not because he had done with the story
of the Sixth day in the first Chapter, but because that story being large) he
would first in a brief sort lay down the story of all the seven days of the
week together, which he does from the beginning of Genesis to the end of the
third verse of the second Chapter, and then he returns again to speak of the
story of the sixth day more at large, and makes a larger Narration of the
Creation, and Fall of Adam, from the seventh verse of the second Chapter, to
the end of the third Chapter, with variety of inlargements more than was in the
first Chapter; for repetitions have usually many new additions* and so in true
Chronology, and in the order of story, the Institution of the Sabbath in Genesis
2. 2, 3. must be placed at the end of Genesis 3. as I have after discussed the
matter in that Text.

And the method of Moses in this large story of the sixth day, is very
observable, and lies thus.

1 He shows the Matter and Form of Adams Creation, in Chap. 2. verse. 7. but
this he had omitted in Chap. 1.

2 He shows Adams Lordship over the creatures, for God commanded all the
beasts of the field, and all the fowls of the air, to present themselves before
Adam as their Lord, that he might name them with names defining their nature,
and that they might wait upon him as their Lord and Master into Paradise, verse.
19, 20. but in a part of his Lordship he was restrained, because God did
prohibit him the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

3 He shows the matter and manner of the Woman's creation, of Adams Rib, verse.
18. which he had omitted in Chap. 1. and it is placed in Chap. 2. verse. 18. by
the figure Hysteron Proteron, because there was not to be found among all the
other creatures that were brought before Adam, a meet helper for Adam, verse.
20. she was the last sort of all the visible creatures of this world.

4 God brings the woman to the man, and joins them together in Marriage, as a
meet helper for him, verse. 22. This was omitted in Chap. 1.

5 He shows that the place of their creation was without the borders of
Paradise, verse. 8. 15. compared with Chap. 3. 23.

6 He describes the situation of that pleasant Garden of Paradise, which God
made for the place of their habitation, as an addition to their happy condition
by creation, verse. 8. etc. but this is to be marked, that Moses does by the
figure Hyst^ron Proteron, place their abode in Paradise, verse. 8. etc. before
the creation of the woman; which figure he uses very often in this Chapter,
and in the third Chapter.

7 He shows the special use of two Trees above the rest, by special names,
verse. 9.

8 He shows that God gave Adam and Eve a twofold command concerning these two
Trees: The first was a positive command, saying unto them in the singular
number (because of their Mariage-union) Of every Tree of the Garden thou may
eat, but of that Tree which does most concern the good of thy present condition
(I have named the Tree of life) therefore in the first place eat of the Tree of
life, and thou shall live for ever, for by the name of it, God did not only
show the use of it, but also he showed them their duty concerning it, verse 9.
compared with Chapter 3. 22. Secondly, By way of prohibition and commination,
God commanded them saying, Eat not of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil,
for in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shall surely dye the death, Genesis 2. 17.

9 Unto all these particulars in this order connexed together, Moses does
immediately proceed to speak of Adams temptation by the Serpent, Genesis 3. 1. and
of his Fall, Genesis 3. 6. And thus after this sort, Moses does adjoyn Adams fall
fast to his Creation, and seating in Paradise, without making mention of any
other matter that came between.

This Reason is further strengthened by the consent of sundry good Authors both
ancient and latter.

Calvin says in Genesis 3. 6. It may be gathered by the Narration of Moses, That
Adam and Eve did not long keep their Dignity which they had received, for as
soon as he had but said they were made, making no mention of any other matter,
he passes to show the Fall.

Mr. Ainsworth also observes in Genesis 3. 1. That man's fall and misery is
immediately joined to his creation, and seating in Paradise.

Mr. Broughton also observes (in his Sinai-sight Tab. 1.) That Moses joyneth
man's Creation, Trial, Judgment, and Promise, to the same day before the woman
was called Eve.

M. Broughton also in his showing of corruptions in Religion p. 85. says, The
first day, in which Adam was made, he disobeyed, as all may see by the
continued narration for Eve, and for the Serpents Speech, and Temptation, and
Judgment for Curse upon all the Earth.

The Hebrew Doctors also do generally hold that Adam fell on the day of his
creation; Mr. Broughton says, in Consent of Scripture, that he never heard of
any one of them that was of a contrary judgment, and Mr. Ainsworth says in
Genesis 3. that the Hebrew Doctors hold that nothing (in that Chapter) was done
after the sixth day of Creation, and says Maymony, All our wise men do agree,
that this whole matter (in Genesis 3.) was done in the sixth day.

Rabbi Nathan does make the story of the sixth day remarkable, by joining many
things to the story of that day in sundry Rhetorical expressions, saying thus,
The same day that Adam was formed, the same day that he was created, the same
day that his fashion was fashioned, the same day that his mould was made, the
same day that his members were knit, the same day that his veins were opened,
the same day that life was put into him, the same day that he stood first upon
his feet, the same day that Eve was married to him, the same day that he gave
names, the same day that he entered into Paradise, the same day that God gave
him the Commandment, the same day he disobeyed, the same day he was driven out
of Paradise.

Perkins on the Creed, touching the time of Adams Fall, says, The received
opinion in former ages has been, that our first Parents fell the same day in
which they were created, and therefore Augustine writes, That they stood but
six hours; and though we cannot determine the certain time, yet in all
likelihood (says he) it was very short, for after that Moses had set down the
creation of man, he presently without the interposition of any thing else,
comes immediately to the fall.

Irenaeus Contra Haere. Lib. 1. speaking of the day of Adams Creation and Fall,
says, It is evident, that the Lord obeying his Father, suffered death in that
day wherein Adam being disobedient unto God dyed; for on the sixth day, the day
before the Sabbath, was his Passion, which was the sixth day of the Creation of
the world when man was formed.

Chrysostom on Matthew. says, That Adam and Eve in the sixth day of the first
week, which was the very same day of their creation, were cast out of Paradise.

Diverse other Divines both Greeks and Latins are concurrent in the same
opinion, many of which are also cited by Mr. Broughton in his Consent of
Scripture, where he cites this as a common saying among them, That in one day
Adam was formed, and deformed.

And so consequently from this Reason it follows, that the Sabbath was not
instituted in the time of Adams Innocence, but after his Fall.

Reason 2. Adam fell the very first time that ever he eat any thing, Adam fell
in the day of his creation, because he fell the very first time of his eating.
and therefore he fell on the day of his creation; for in reason he would not
abstain from eating longer than that day, seeing variety of meat was created
ready for him to eat, and an appetite created to desire food.

And that he fell the very first time of eating, it is evident, First, By the
Devils Question; and secondly, By the Woman's Answer.

1 The Devil in the Serpent, demands this Question of the woman, Has God
said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the Garden? Genesis 3. 1. mark how the
Devils demand, by way of Query, is of a thing to come: And indeed the Devil
had not deserved the name of a subtle Serpent, if he had demanded whether that
might be done, which had been done already.

2 The Woman's Answer to the Serpents Question runs still of a thing to come:
For the Woman said to the Serpent in Genesis 3. 2. We may eat, or we shall eat (so
the Hebrew is) of the fruit of the Trees of the Garden, except of the fruit of
the Tree which is in the midst of the Garden; intimating, says Mr. Perkins on
the Creed, that as yet she had not eaten when the Devil tempted her; and thus
the Devils Question, and the Woman's Answer of a thing to come, do both imply,
that as yet they had not tasted any part of the fruit of the Garden; and
doubtless Adam having variety of food set before him, and a created appetite
to eat, he would not abstain from eating longer than the day of his creation,
seeing the purest nature craves daily food, as we may see by our Saviors
hungring, and by all newborn creatures; neither was Adam necessitated to fast
for want of food, for variety of food was set before him* and free liberty to
eat thereof, verse. 16. neither was Adams appetite hindered through any infirmity
of nature, for as God had created variety of food for their eating, so
doubtless he created a true natural appetite in them to desire food (at the
first convenient opportunity) though their appetite was not irregular and
painful to them as ours is to us.

And doubtless the devil was not ignorant that Adam and Eve had a true
natural appetite to desire food, and therefore without any delay he fitted his
temptation suitable to their natural appetite, and the like crafty policy he
used to our Savior when he was an hungry, and because there was no meat
prepared for him in a readiness as there was for Adam, he fitted his
temptation thereafter, saying, If thou be the Son of God, make this stone
bread, Mat. 4. So then it appears by this reason, that Adam would not forbear
eating longer than the day of his creation; and it appears by the Devils
Question, and the Woman's Answer, that as yet they had eaten no fruit till they
had eaten of the forbidden fruit, and therefore it follows, First, That Adam
fell in the day of his creation; And secondly, that the Sabbath was not
ordained in the time of Adams innocence but after his fall. Because Adam being
created after God in wisdom, would not in wisdom have omi^ted to have eaten of
the tree of life in the very day of his creation, if the devil had not first
circum vented him by the unseen subtilty of his temptation.


Reason 3. Adam and Eve being created after the image of God in Wisdom, had not
deserved the description of being made wise according to Gods Image, (if the
devil had left them but one day to the freedom of their own will) if they had
not made choice to eat of the Tree of life in the first place; First, seeing
God had commanded them to eat freely of every Tree of the Garden, verse 16. And
secondly, seeing God had commended unto them the Tree of life by name (for by
the special name of it God did teach them to prefer it) before all the other
trees in the Garden, for their best good: And it is evident from Gods
threatening in Genesis 2. 17. that seeing man must dye if he disobeyed by eating
the forbidden fruit, that Gods See Mr. Ball on the Covenant, p. 6.
Covenant was with Adam for life, if he had but first eaten of the Tree of
life, and this is manifest by the name of the Tree, in verse. 9. compared with
Gods Irony in Chapter 3. 22. for by the name of it God showed him what
operation it had by virtue of his Covenant And Mr. Burges in Vindicialegis
lect. 13. and vindic^ae faederis, by Mr. Blake.
and Ordinance.

Therefore if the Devil had let Adam and Eve alone but one whole day to the
liberty and freedom of their own created wisdom, doubtless they would both
in wisdom, and in obedience to Gods command, and to Gods commendation of the
Tree of life for their best good, have eaten of the Tree of life in the first
place, as the chiefest and best food, for it tended directly to the
confirmation of them, not only in their present, but also in their future
happy condition.

And this the Devil knew right well, and therefore he knew that unless he
could by his subtle head-plot circumvent Adam and Eve, by enticing them to eat
of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, before they did eat of the Tree of
life, that he could never afterward beguile them by any temptation whatsoever.

And it is also evident, that Adam did well enough know the excellent use of
the Tree of life by the name of it, verse. 9. as it appears by the speech of the
blessed Trinity, in Genesis 3. 22. Behold say they, the man is become as one of
US, to know good and evil, and now lest he put forth his hand, and take also
of the Tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.

This speech of the blessed Trinity, though it be spoken by way of Irony to
Adam after his fall, yet it implies that Adam and Eve knew that if they had
but eaten of the Tree of life in their innocence, they had been confirmed in
their present perfect condition for ever, but now being fallen, God does mock
their conceit as vain to think so; for a modest Irony has always a contrary
meaning to that which is spoken, and the scope of such an Irony is to express
a just reprehension of some sin, as it may be observed in Judges 10. 14. 1
King. 22. 15. 1 King. 8. 27.

And because the Tree of life had that virtue in it at first by Gods Covenant
and Ordinance; Therefore by way of comparison thereto, Christ is now called the
Tree of Life, Rev. 2. 7. That whosoever believes on him, or feeds by faith
on his death, and expiatory sacrifice, or sacrifices of Atonement (by which he
has broken the Devils head-plot) he shall never perish, but have everlasting
life.

Reason 4. The Devil had not deserved or merited the name of a Because the
Devil had not deserved the name of a subtle Serpent, if he had left Adam at
liberty to eat of the Tree of life, but one whole day together.
subtle Serpent, if he had not by his subtle and guileful head-plot,
circumvented Adam, to make him eat of the forbidden fruit, in the very first
place, even in the day of his creation, before he left him at liberty to eat of
any other fruit of the Garden.

For the cralty Devil in the subtle Serpent knew well enough that if he had but
left Adam and Eve to the liberty of their own choice, but one whole day
together, they would in wisdom, and in obedience to Gods command (that had
commanded them to eat of every Tree, and in relation to Gods commendation of
the Tree of life above the rest of the fruit of the Garden) have eaten of that
Tree in the first place; and then the Devil knew well enough by the name of
that Tree, that if Adam and Eve had but first eaten of that fruit he had been
confirmed in his happy condition for ever, and that he could not have been
circumvented by any temptation whatsoever afterward.

This subtle and guileful head-plot of the Devil, lay not only in the
hiddennesse and unseen danger of his temptation, but also in the speediness of
the execution of it, for if it had not been speedily put in execution, the then
unseen danger had been prevented by Adams wisdom in eating of the Tree of life
in the first place.

But the Devil was so speedy in the transaction of this temptation that he gave
Adam no opportunity of time to go first to the Tree of life; and this may
further be demonstrated from the antecedent Preposition in Genesis 3. 1. Now, or
Then, or And; this word of connection does conjoyn and knit together sundry
actions.

1 This word Now has relation to the woman's creation and marriage with Adam,
because among all the other creatures he found not a meet helper for Adam. 2.
It has relation to the time of their entrance into Paradise. 3 To the time of
the Devils fall. 4 To the time of the Devils entrance into the Serpent. 5 To
the time of their first eating.
All these things fell out together, even in the neck one of another, and all
of them as I conceive in the same order as I have ranked them*

1 God brought the woman to the man that he might name with a name defining her
nature, and that he might mary them her together as one flesh; and this time of
Adams marriage with Eve was just before his entrance into Paradise; but some
unadvised Expositors do confound this order, for they place the time of Adams
marriage (not before, but) after he came into Paradise; First, Because it is
said that Adam in the singular number was put therein, Genesis 2. 8. 15. Secondly,
Because the woman's creation and marriage is not recorded till after mention of
Adams seating in Paradise, verse 22, 23.

But a sensible reason may be given to both these; first, Under the name of
Adam in the singular number the woman is included, because God had made them
but one flesh by marriage immediately before their entrance into Paradise, and
in that respect the Seventy translate Ye, for Thou, in Genesis 2. 17. because
they understood both of them to be comprehended under the term Thou.

And therefore those Mariage-Books, says Mr. Broughton, have an oversight,
that say, The woman was formed in Paradise; for the Commandment Thou shall not
eat thereof, in verse. 17. went not before the creation of the woman (nor before
her marriage to Alam) but after; she had the Commandment as well as Adam, in
the same term Thou, as being but one flesh by marriage. See Bro. in principal
Positions Page 10. and the matter is out of controversy, for the woman does
testify that the Commadement was given to them both jointly; for thus says
she to the Serpent, God has said, ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye
touch it lest ye dye, Genesis 3. 3. in this sentence she does three times over
affirm that Gods prohibition was given to them both jointly.

The story of the time of Adams marriage lies thus: First, God in the sixth day
created all sorts of Beasts of the Earth, and all sorts of the Fowls of the
air: Secondly, Then he created Adam after his own Image, as the glory of all
his creation; And thirdly, then he brought all the said creatures before him,
that he might put suitable names upon them as their Lord, and that they might
wait upon him as their Lord, Genesis 2. 19, 20. But fourthly, Because among them
all, God did not find out a meet helper for Adams society, thereupon God as a
most expert Surgeon, did cast Adam into a deep sleep, and took out one of his
Ribs, and of that Rib, as a most mighty Creator, he made a woman; and this was
the last sort of visible creatures that God made. Fifthly, Then God brought her
unto Adam, to see what Adam would call her, and he being exquisite in
understanding said, This now is bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh, she
shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man. And sixthly, At this
instant, God gave her in marriage to Adam, to be as one flesh, and to be a meet
helper to him. And therefore secondly, the only reason why the woman's
creation, and marriage, is not recorded till after the mention of Adams seating
in Paradise, is, because by the figure Hysteron Proteron, he would show the
close joining of the Devils temptation, and of their Fall, to their marriage.

2 This word of connection [ And or Now] has relation to the time of Adam and
Eves entrance into Paradise, it was [ Now] namely as soon as God had joined
them together as one flesh by marriage (which was done without the borders of
Paradise) he did without delay carry them both into Paradise, as to the place
of pleasure that he had in a special manner prepared for their delight and
comfort during the time of their innocence; There he put the man that he had
formed, Genesis 2. 8. And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the Garden
of Eden, Genesis 2. 15. and after his fall, thence, God sent him forth to till the
ground whence he was taken, Genesis 3. 23. From these Scriptures it is evident,
that as soon as God had given the woman in marriage to Adam, he presently
brought them both into Paradise, and commanded all sorts of creatures to attend
on them into Paradise, as on their Sovereign Lord, Genesis 1. 26, 28. Genesis 2. 19.
and this is also evident, because the Serpent was there ready among the other
Beasts of the field to do service to them, Genesis 3. 1. And because God had made
man to be the glory of his whole creation, he did command, not only his
earthly creatures, but his heavenly Angels also, to attend upon them into
Paradise, as it may be gathered, because God does still command his Angels to
attend upon such as he has The time of the fall of the Angels, n^w called the
Devil, was when they were commanded to attend upon Adam and Eve in Paradise.
dignified to be heirs of salvation, Heb. 1. 14, Psalm. 91.

3 This word of connection [ Now] has reference to the time of the Devils Fall;
For the heavenly Angels (that rejoiced at the hanging of the Globe of the Earth
upon nothing, Job 38. 7.) were now commanded to attend upon Adam and Eve into
Paradise, as well as the Beasts of the field; But many legions of these
heavenly Angels disobeyed that charge, for they saw that man's body was but an
earthly substance, and that themselves were heavenly See H. ^ro. in Ecc. his
Chief Mark.
spirits, thereupon they not knowing the glory of man's Election in Christ,
refused to attend upon Adam and Eve into Paradise, and for that disobedience,
God deprived them of their pure qualities, and so they became dead in corrupt
and sinful qualities, and ever since they have continued to be an envious
company against the good of man: But it seems there was diversity of judgment
among them touching that service in attending upon our first parents, for there
were many legions of those Angels that despised man in comparison of themselves
(because God did not support them by his assisting grace) and there were many
legions that continued to do service to them, because God did support them in
their obedience by his assisting grace, but the millions of them that fell for
refusing to serve man, did without delay conspire together in one Head-plot as
soon as ever they were fallen to destroy mankind, and in that respect they are
collectively called Satan, the Adversary, by which name it is evident that
from the very first they were adverse to serve man.

Our minds (says Mr. Bro. in Req. of Consent. page 75.) cannot once think of
any other subject in God (who dwells in terrible light) against which the
Devil durst spurn, neither deals he but to hurt man; as still showing that
from hatred to man was his Fall.

Envy (says Lanquet) came first of Satan, for envying the felicity of man
whom God had created and set in Paradise, he changed himself into an Angel of
light, abusing the wisdom of the Serpent to deceive man. See Marbek's
Common-places, page 339.

At the creation of the woman (which was the last particular kind of all Gods
creation) the Angels were not fallen; for at the end of Gods visible creation
on the sixth day* It is said, That God saw all that he had made, and lo it was
very good, Genesis 1. 31.

From this Text it may certainly be gathered, that no creature was yet become
bad; and therefore that the Angels were not fallen when the woman was created;
but their fall was presently after the woman was created and given in marriage
to Adam; all which was done without the borders of Paradise, but then God
intending to bring them into Paradise, all creatures whom Adam had named as
their Lord were to attend upon him, and then God gave his Angels charge also to
atend upon them (as I have formerly noted it to be a chief part of their
office, from Heb. 1. 14. because God intended to dignifie man's nature, not
only above all his visible creatures, but even above Angels also, Heb. 2. 10.
But the Angels not knowing Gods eternal Counsel concerning man's dignity, which
should be so much advanced through Christ, dis-esteemed man (as being made but
of the basest element) in comparison of themselves that were spirits invisible,
and of a heavenly nature, and in that respect they refused to obey Gods
positive command, in refusing to attend upon Adam, and then as many of them as
refused that service and station in which God had set them, were by Gods
justice deprived of their moral perfections, and are ever since become an
envious company to man's good.

No other time I think can be found for the time of the Angels fall, but this,
as I have formerly noted; And therefore as soon as God had brought Adam and Eve
into Paradise, and all creatures both visible and invisible to attend him, then
that number of the Angels that fell for refusing to serve man, took special
notice of Gods Command and Covenant with Adam concerning the two Trees, and
concerning the condition of his nature The true nature of the first Covenant
stood in obedience, or in disobedience, to a positive, and not to a moral
command. See Bucan. in his 10 Com. place, and in his 15. Com. pl.
what it was, and what it should be, in case he did first eat of the Tree of
life, or what it should be, in case he did first eat of the Tree of knowledge
of good and evil; namely, that his nature should be confirmed in his created
perfections for ever, in case he did first eat of the Tree of life; but in case
he did first eat of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, then his nature
should dye the death (that is to say) he should be deprived of his natural
perfections wherein he was created.

Adams Righteousness (says Bucanus) was the Righteousness of man's nature,
and not the Righteousness of a private person; If Adam (says he) had stood in
his original Righteousness, it had been derived to all his posterity; and
says he in his fifteenth Common place; Adams Righteousness was not so much
personal and proper to him, as natural, namely, as it was common to all men's
nature which were originally and naturally in the loins of Adam, and therefore
truly original, and so consequently in case of disobedience he should lose his
original righteousness, namely his natural perfections, and instead of it
should be possessed with a corrupt and sinful nature to all posterity.

I say the fallen Angels did take special notice of the true nature of this
first Covenant with Adam; and therefore without delay they did presently join
together in one head or headplot to beguile the woman, by enticing her to eat
of the forbidden fruit before she might have the opportunity to eat first of
the tree of life; and the better to effect this head-plot of theirs, they did
first reason with God against the nature of Adam (as they did afterward
against Job) saying, That his nature was not more perfect than theirs was by
creation; and therefore that Adam would disobey Gods positive command as they
had done, if they might have but leave to try him. Now God being a cunning and
complete Workman would not be out-bidden by Satan's brags, and therefore he
gave Satan leave to do his worst (as he did afterward give him leave to do
his worst to Christ) for he knew that if his workmanship should fail upon the
trial, he could tell how to mend it, and how to make it better able to endure
the trial for time to come.

4 This Adverb [ Now, in Genesis 3. 1.] has relation to the time when the devil
did first enter into the body of the subtle Serpent, and that was now
presently without any delay; and therefore though this Serpent was but a bru^e
creature without any natural power, to speak, discourse, and reason with an
intelligible voice about what was good or evil, yet the devil had received
such a power and commission from God, that he did make this Serpent to be his
lively oracle (as the Angel made Balaams Ass to be his) and therefore in as
much as the Serpent did speak and discourse with Eve, it is an infallible proof
that God had given the devil leave to tempt and to try Adams obedience to the
first positive Covenant by any slight he could devise (as he did after give
the devil the like leave to tempt Christ for forty days together) and
therefore the devils head-plot was now instantly put in execution without any
delay of time (even as soon as the Conmandment and Covenant concerning the two
Trees was given) he did enter into the body of the Serpent, and did actuate the
tongue of the Serpent to speak his mind: And therefore in the first place, he
did most cunningly preoccupy the woman's objection; yea Moreover (said he) Has
God indeed said ye shall nor eat of every Tree of the Garden? This word
Moreover shows that some other speech of the woman's, in opposition to the
Serpent, had gone before which the devil did now answer, by persuading her
that the forbidden fruit was therefore detained from them, because it was
better for their future good than the Tree of life was; For, says the Serpent,
it will make you excel in all kind of knowledge like God.

To this infinuating Interrogation (which doubtless the woman thought to be no
other but the voice of some good Angel or servant) she makes this reply, Of
the fruit of the Trees of the Garden we may eat; but of the fruit of the Tree
which is in the midst of the Garden, God has said, ye shall net eat of it,
neither shall ye touch it, lest ye dye.

Then the good Angel in the Serpent (for the woman knew not that any of the
Angels were fallen as yet) said to the woman, Ye shall not dye at all: for God
does know that in the day ye shall eat thereof your eyes shall be opened and
you shall be as This term Gods, was such an Equivocal term that it might well
deceive the woman, for she could not conceive it to have an evil sense from a
good Angel as she thought this to be; but she was deceived, for it was a fallen
Angel that spoke this to her, and meant that she should be as Gods, namely like
themselves (for the devils are called Gods, 1 Samuel 28. 13. 2 Cor. 4. 4. 1 Cor.
8. 5.) and that they should know by experience (as they did) what good they
should ^ofe, and what ^vill they should get, by eating the forbidden fruit; but
the woman taking this voice of the Serpent, for the voice and counsel of a good
Angel or Servant, was persuaded that her eating of the Tree of knowledge of
good and evil, would better her condition, for the woman knew that their state
and condition might be bettered, for she knew that her eating of the Tree of
life would better their estate, because it was ordained to confirm them in
their created perfections; and in that respect the seeing the Tree of knowledge
to be good, for meat, and a desire to the eyes, and a tree to be coveted to
make one wife, did take and eat, Gen 3. 6. and she was the more easily
begulled, because she knew not that any of the Angels were fallen; Adam could
not know (says P. Martyr) by reason in his mind that the Devil was fallen at
first; or else (says he) his will had been governed by his mind; and in this
respect Adams disobedience is called but a stumble, which may happen to the
wisest men, when they discern not the block that lies hid in their way; and so
the first offense in Romans 5. 15. is translated the inco^siderate stumble (by
good Linguists) Adams integrity of nature was such by creation, that he was not
ignorant of any moral duty, and therefore he could not will any moral evil, but
he might will to eat any fruit that was good by creation; It was not a sin
against the law of his nature so to will, and therefore in case he had forborne
the act of eating the forbidden f^uit, he had not sinned by his desire to eat;
but because he knew not that any of the Angels were fallen, he could not but
think that the Angel that spoke in the erpent, had received* some new
Commission from God to persuade him to eat of the forbidden fruit for his best
good; and after this sort the devil in the old Prophet persuaded the young
Prophet to eat and to drink in his house, though the young Prophet knew that
Gods positive command was to the contrary; It is likely he thought that the old
Prophet had received some n^w commission from God to persuade him and so he was
deceived to his utter ruin and death, 1 King. 13.
Gods, knowing good and evil. And thus the fallen Angels did persuade the
woman that she should excel in the Theory of all kind of knowledge more than
she had by creation, if she did but once taste of the Tree of knowledge of good
and evil.

Now mark the Devils dexterity, how cunningly, and how speedily he ^^tted his
temptation to the woman's liking: First, It was most suitable to her natural
appetite of eating. Secondly, It was most suitable to her natural desire of
attaining a further degree of knowledge, which she might desire, and she knew
that she might also attain it, if she had but first eaten of the Tree of life;
The Devil knew the operation of the forbidden fruit, better than Adam and Eve
could do as long as they stood in their unconfirmed condition*
but the devil under the pretense of being an Angel of light, and of being her
faithful servant (in wishing her to eat of this fruit for her good) deceived
her, for he knew the operation of the forbidden fruit by his own spiritual
death, better than Adam and Eve could do as yet, namely as long as they stood
unconfirmed; for the Devil knew what that evil was by experience, which Adam
and Eve could not so well know until they had eaten; they knew that the Tree
of knowledge was called the Tree of evil death, and that it was death to eat of
it; and this they might have known more fully in the Theory of it, had they but
known of the fall of the Angels before they had eaten, but God was pleased to
conceal the fall of the Angels from them, and to let them do their worst to
make Adam fall, because he knew how to bring a greater good out of it at last,
than if they had stood still in their integrity.

5 The Adverb [ Now] has relation to the time when the woman disobeyed, namely
it was now before she had tasted any other fruit in the Garden: This time of
her eating I have at large explained in my second Reason, and therefore do
refer the Reader thither.

But there are several things to be marked in the dexterity of the Devil in
taking hold of the very first opportunity of time to speed his temptation.

1 He beguiled the woman's apprehension on the sudden, by The Devil was
exceeding nimble to speed his temptation, and therefore he comprised many acts
together to hasten the act of Adams disobedient eating.
his specious, though deceitful persuasions, for he persuaded her it was for
her greatest good to eat of the Tree of knowledge, and thereby he presented the
greatest amity to her that might be in a faithful servant.

2 He did at the same instant climb the tree (for Serpents have a nimble
faculty to climb trees) and made choice of the fairest fruit, and then he
presented it to the woman that she might view it, and look upon it.

3 By this means he gained her natural appetite to it; for the Text says, She
saw it was good for meat, and that it was a desire to her eyes, and that it was
a tree to be coveted to make one wise. And thus by this means her deceitful
servant got in upon her.

4 Upon this advice of her faithful servant she took thereof and did eat.

5 As soon as she was gained to the will of Satan, then at the same time he
made her his instrument to gain her husband, as soon therefore as she had
tasted of the forbidden fruit she reached out her hands, and gave some of it to
her husband, and he did eat without any suspicion of hurt from her that was
given to him to be a meet helper; and her act of giving was prevalent with him,
because instead of telling him that death was in her eating, she used words of
persuasion, as it is most evident, because he is said to hearken unto the voice
of his wife, Genesis 3. 17. and then the eyes of them both were opened, and then
they knew that they were naked; before this they knew that they were naked
without clothes, and yet they were not ashamed, because their created
nakedness was covered and adorned with pure created qualities, Genesis 3 7. Genesis
2. 25. But now the case of their nakedness was altered by the justice of God,
for Gods determinate sentence was, In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shall
dye the death; and this death was formally executed upon them, according to the
time and manner threatened; and now Adam knew what evil was, and what death was,
experimentally, as the fallen Angels did, for now they were made naked and bare
of their pure created qualities.

A digression to show that the death threatened in Genesis 2. 17. was executed The
death threatened in Genesis 2. 17. was executed on man's nature in three degrees.
on man's nature in three degrees.

Consider that the first Covenant was made with Adam concerning man's nature in
general, as I have formerly noted, and accordingly did God execute that death
upon Adams nature, as it was the original of man's nature in general.

I Therefore as Paul speaks, They were deprived of the glorious Image of God,
Romans 3. 23. And this deprivation, says M. Perkins, was inflicted by God as a
deserved punshment for the sin of Adam; and See Perkins on the Creed. p. 162.
See P. Martyr in Rom 5. and Bucan in his Com. pl. p. 104.
this loss of Gods Image says Peter Martyr, was from the justice of God; and
I find it commonly held by other eminent Divines, that God for the sin of Adam
took away his created perfections from Adam (as he took away his spirit of
Government from Soul, because he spared Agag, against Gods positive Command, 1 Samuel 16. 14.) for they were not yet confirmed, and therefore they were but lent
him in case he disobeyed; but the Graces of Gods Spirit, which Christ has
purchased for the Re-creation of the Elect after Gods Image, cannot now be
utterly lost by the commission of many sins, because they are purchased to be
confirmed to them, and not to fail until they come to the fruition of an
eternal Paradise in heaven.

The Image of God wherewith Adams Nature was adorned, would have kept him, and
all his Posterity for ever from death, if he had but first eaten of the Tree of
Life; but because he did first eat of the forbidden Fruit, he was deprived of
Gods Image; And then secondly, Death in Sin fell upon his Nature.

When the Souls of men are Created and placed in their Bodies, (says Mr.
Perkins) God forsakes them not in regard of their See Perkins on the Creed, p.
162.
substance, or faculties of their Soul, but only in respect of his own Image,
whereof the Soul is deprived.

And he asks this question, How can the Soul dye the second Death? His answer
is, That the Soul dies not by being utterly abolished, but because it is as
though it were not; and because it cease to be in respect of Righteousness,
and Fellowship with God; and indeed (says he) this is the death of all deaths,
when the Creature has subsisting and being, and yet is deprived of all
comfortable fellowship with God.

2 The second degree of that Death threatened in Genesis 2. 17. was death in sin,
and this death fell upon Adams nature at the very See Perkins in the right way
of dying well.
instant, as soon as God had subtracted his Image from him; for we see by
experience, that as soon as the God of Nature has subtracted the light of the
Sun from our Horizon, there remains nothing but obscure darkness, and then no
Artificers, nor Scholars can work, or write after their Masters perfect Copy,
but instead thereof, they work, and act irregularly, and transgress against
their Masters copy; Even so, as soon as God in Justice had subtracted the
Light and Life of his Image from Adam, what remained but obscure darkness in
his mind, and then what could he do else but think and act irregularly, and
that continually, as long as he did continue in that darkness? and this
darkness after the light it self is mystically applied to man's corrupt estate,
Ephesians. 4. 18. Ephesians. 5. 8. being alienated from the life of God, Ephesians. 2. 1.

When the Soul is deprived of Gods Image, says Mr. Perkins, then follows a
defect, or want of righteousness, and I may also say, then follows a natural
proness to all kind of iniquity, so that the very thoughts and imaginations of
the heart are only evil, and that continually, and this frame is called
Original sin to us, though Adams Original sin was his actual eating of the
forbid-Fruit; and this is the second degree of that death threatened in Genesis 2.
17.

3 A third degree of that death was, that Adam was now under the power and
slavery of Satan (which had the power of death, Heb. 2. 14.) to do his will and
pleasure in all things to the full, and to be under the power of a Tyrant is
death, Psalm. 18. 4. But it pleased God in his eternal Counsel and Providence to
provide Jesus Christ to take possession of the world as the right Heir of it,
as soon as Adam fell, and so to uphold all things by the word of his power, Heb.
1. 2, 3. by which means both Satan's power, tyranny, and malice, and man's
corrupt desires and endeavors are restrained, and ordered so, that now they
cannot See Capel on Tempt p. 55, 56. and see mere in chapter 3. in R. 2.
do that wickedness which else they would do; and were it not for this
Government of Christ at the instant of Adams fall, no man can imagine what
destructive mischiefs would have fallen at that very instant upon the whole
Creation, which was the very thing that Satan aimed at in his temptation; but
blessed be God that provided Jesus Christ against that time of need.

But after this digression in setting out the degrees of the first Spiritual
death, as it must be understood, in Genesis 2. 17. I will now return to speak a
little more of the Devils speech and subtilty, in deceiving the Woman, and in
making her his instrument to deceive Adam; The Devil did not deal with the
Woman about any Moral disobedience (as he did with Christ, after he had tried
him with many other temptations for forty days together) for he knew that Adams
nature was framed after Gods Image in respect of Moral perfection, but he deals
with her about positive commands only, for he knew that she was not so perfect
in the knowledge of those things by Creation, as she was in all Moral things;
he knew that the Woman was ignorant as yet of the positive Law that was given
to the Angels to attend upon them, (as the visible Creatures were,) for they
being Spirits, their motions and actions were not subject to be discerned by
bodily senses, and in that respect also Eve was ignorant of their disobedience
and fall, and she was also ignorant that they had obtained leave of God to
tempt her about the Tree of Knowledge (which was a thing indifferent in its own
nature to be eaten, or refused) but if the Woman had but known of these things,
then her Moral and Natural wisdom would have fortified her will against all
Satan's temptations whatsoever; for we see by the example of Christ, that when
the Devil did persuade him by Peter's tongue to pity himself, and not to go to
Jerusalem to suffer, then Christ could not be deceived by his persuasions,
because he knew that Peter's tongue was acted by Satan, and therefore he said
unto Peter, Get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offense unto me, Mat. 16. 23.
but for the manner of this knowledge, the Woman could not call this Angel
Satan, and therefore she could not resist so steadfastly, as else doubtless she
would have done; yea, if the Angels that fell had but known of Man's glory by
Gods election in Christ, they would not have refused to serve man, for in this
manner the Apostle does reason about the Sin of the Princes of this World, had
they but known (says he) of the hidden Wisdom of God, which he ordained before
the world unto our glory, they would not have Crucified the Lord of glory, 2
Cor. 2. 7, 8. so I may say of the Woman's Fall, if she had but known of the fall
of Angels, she would not have been deceived by the Serpent.

But because the Woman was ignorant of those positive Secrets (and God was
pleased not to reveal them to her as yet) she was deceived, and then she was
easily made Satan's Instrument to deceive her Husband; and then they did
experimentally know that some of the Angels were fallen, and that they had leave
of God to tempt them, and that the Devil was a Liar, and a Murderer from the
beginning, Joh. 8. 44. The Syriack on the word Beginning, is Men Bresbith, that
is, by all Rabbis, within the days of Creation, and says Mr. Perkins, Our
Savior calls See Perkins on the Creed.
the Devil a Manslayer from the beginning, not from the beginning of the
Creation, or of Time, but of Man; and seeing (says he) it is the nature of the
Devil to show his malice (against Man) without ceasing, no doubt but he took
the first occasion that might possible be had to bring man to the same
Damnation with himself.

And why is the Devil said to go up and down, or to walk about, seeking whom he
may devour, like a roaring Lion? but to express his speedy diligence in his
first temptation, as well as in his after temptations? 1 Pet. 5. 8.

And why is the Devil called the Old Serpent, Revel. 12. but from his ancient
deceiving of the understanding and will of our first Parents? And why is he
said to have the power of Death? Heb. 2. 14. but from his first prevailing
temptation, in prevailing with our first Parents to eat of the forbidden Fruit.
Why is he called the subtle Serpent? Genesis 3. 1. but from his subtilty in
deceiving Eve, while she was a Virgin, 2 Cor. 11. 3.

And thus Adam in Honor (Created after Gods Image) understood not (for as yet
he understood not that any of the Angels were become Devils, or that they spoke
with the tongue of the Serpent) he was like the Beasts that perish, Psalm. 49.
20.

Adam did not lodge a night in Honor, Psalm. 49. 12. for he was deprived of
the glorious Image of God, namely, of his Moral and Natural perfections, before
night came.

Theophilact says, As man was formed the sixth day, and did eat of the
forbidden Fruit at the sixth hour; so Christ healing the Fall, was fastened to
the Tree the sixth day, and the sixth hour.

Austin also is of opinion, that Adam stood in his innocence but six hours only.

From all this Discourse in this reason, though it be long, because I have
interlaced several collateral considerations, yet (I hope profitable to the
understanding of the weaker sort) this Conclusion follows, That the Devil had
not deserved the name of a subtle Serpent, if he had not presently, and
without delay, (namely as soon as Adam had received the Commandment, to eat of
all the Trees in the Garden, and of the Tree of Life above the rest) brought
him by his subtilty to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of good and Evil in the
first place, before he had so much liberty as to go first to the Tree of Life;
for the Devil knew that if Adam had had but a little time free from his
temptation, his created Wisdom was such, that he would have eaten of the Tree
of Life in the first place, and then the Devil had not deserved the name of a
subtle Serpent; but because the Devil by his speedy subtilty brought our first
Parents to eat of the forbidden Fruit in the first place, before they had
liberty in the day of their Creation, to eat of the Tree of Life, therefore it
follows,

1 That the Devil has justly deserved the name of a subtle Serpent.

2 Hence it also follows, that the Sabbath was not ordained in the time of
Adams innocence, but after his Fall.

Reas. 5. Adam fell in the day of his Creation, because he fell The Woman fell
while she was a Virgin, therefore Adam fell in the day of his Creation.
while the Woman was a Virgin, namely before he knew her after the manner of
all flesh.

If Adam and Eve had slept but one night together in their innocence,
doubtless in wisdom they would not have omitted the act of Generation.

1 Because the desire of begetting Children to increase the kind is not only
something Natural, but it is the most natural thing in the world.

2 And more especially, because it was laid upon him by God as a necessary
duty; for God enforced his obedience to that act by an express command,
saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, Genesis 1. 28. Hence it
follows,

1 That they would not have omitted the act of Generation as soon as they had a
fit opportunity, which they should have had if they had slept but one night
together in their innocence.

2 If they had but once done the act it would doubtless have taken effect, for
God had promised to bless it, and to make it powerful, (there cannot be any
barreness in innocence) and then Adam should have begotten, and Eve should have
conceived their firstborn Cain without sin; But the Scripture does tell us,
that never any man was so conceived and born but Jesus Christ alone, (whose
conception was not by the ordinary way of generation between Man and Woman, but
by the mighty power of the Holy Ghost) hence it follows,

1. That the Serpent had seduced the Woman before she knew her Husband after
the manner of all flesh. And

2. Hence it follows, That she was seduced in the very day of her creation.

Master Calvin says, If they had stood but a short time, the Sea Calv. on Genesis
3. 6.
Blessing of God had not been in vain for propagation.

And Paul may well allude to Eves being deceived by the Serpent, even whiles she
was a Virgin, for he writes thus to the Corinthians, I have espoused you to
one Husband, that I might present you a chaste Virgin to Christ; but I fear,
lest by any means, that as the Serpent beguiled Eve, so your minds should be
corrupted, 2 Corinthians. 11. 1, 2.

The Apostle compares the guiles of false Teachers to the guiles of Satan, and
he compares their sincere minds, as long as they kept fast to the Truth, to
the Virgin Eve, for so long as they kept their minds unpolluted with false
Doctrine, they were Virgin-like; but as Eve the Virgin was beguiled, and defiled
by Satan's fair but false Doctrine; so the Apostle feared lest their minds should
be corrupted, by the fair though false Doctrine of their false Teachers, from
that plainness that is toward Christ, for the Tempter did tempt them by many
seducing Teachers, 1 Thessal. 3. 5. and the Spirit (says the Apostle) speaks
evidently, that in the latter days, (namely in the days of the Gospel) some
should depart from the Faith, giving heed to seducing Spirits, and Doctrins of
Devils, 1 Timothy 4. 1. as the Virgin Eve once did.

Erasmus makes this Comparison; As Evah a Virgin married and undefiled,
believed the speech of the Serpent, brought forth Disobedience and Death; so
many a Virgin married and undefiled, believed the Angle, brought forth
Obedience and Life.

Conclusion.
Having proved hitherto by five Reasons, that Adam fell in the day of his
Creation, it follows by good consequence, That the Sabbath was not ordained in
the time of Adams Innocence, but after his Fall.

CHAP. II.
Proving by three Reasons that Adam was Re-created in the very same day in
which he was Created and Fell.

1. IT is evident to me that Adam was Re-created in the very selfsame Reason 1.
day in which he was created and fell, by the order of Gods dealing with him
immediately after his Fall.

For immediately after he had bitten of the forbidden fruit, and was thereby
dead in corruption and sin from the life of Gods Image in which he was created,
Then God of his rich mercy came to him in the The cool (or wind) of the day
means the Even tide as the Seventy translate it, which begins at Midday, for
the Evening begins when the Sun begins to decline, and then there does usually
arise a cooling wind (called a Seaturn) which the God of nature has ordained
to cool the air in hot Countries.
cool (or in the wind) of the same day, Genesis 3. 8. to confer with him, and to
enquire of him into what state and condition he had brought himself by eating
of the forbidden fruit, saying unto him by way of Query, Adam, Where art thou?
not in what particular place art thou? (as some ignorant persons do understand
it, for God was come to the very place where Adam was;) But into what case have
thou brought thy self by eating of the forbidden fruit? And unto this searching
Query, Adam made a plain Answer, saying in ver. 10. I heard thy voice walking
in the Garden, and I was afraid; and because I was naked of thy Image in which
I was created, I hid my self.

This plain Answer of Adam does imply two things; 1 His fear of Gods wrath. 2
The Reason of it.

1 His fear of Gods wrath in these words, I heard thy voice walking in the
Garden; the word implies, That it walked along by him like roaring Thunder
among the trees of the Garden. And with such a dreadful voice Christ
manifested himself to the Israelites, when he gave the Law at Mount Sinai to
awaken and over-aw their sinful consciences, as Genesis 3. 8. compared with Ex.
19. 16. does manifest and explain the matter; and in this respect the dreadful
voice of Thunder is called Gods voice, Psalm. 29. 3. And this dreadful voice of
God did so terrify his guilty conscience, that it forced Adam to say, I heard
thy voice walking like Thunder in the Garden, and I was afraid; for the guilt
of his conscience told him that he had grievously transgressed against Gods
positive command in eating of the forbidden fruit.

2 He gives another reason why he hid himself among the trees of the Garden,
namely because I was naked both in body and soul of my created qualities, and
therefore I hid my self among the trees of the Garden.

And thus Adams conscience was convinced of his sin, and terrified with Gods
dreadful voice of inquiry concerning his sin and guilt, and thereupon he made
a plain confession, That he was afraid, and that he hid himself because he was
naked.

The Text runs thus, in Genesis 3. 8. They heard the voice of the Lord God walking
in the Garden in the cool (or in the wind) of the day: And Adam and his wife
hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the Garden,
verse. 9. And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where are thou?
verse. 10. And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Have thou eaten of
the Tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should not eat?

And by this searching Query, Adam, Where art thou? Adam was convinced, and
terrified with the sense of his sin, and with the dread of Gods wrath; and when
he saw that he could by no means escape it, he made a plain confession of his
sin and misery, and that he hid himself, because he was naked of Gods Image,
and subject to inordinate lusts, and thereupon to shame and horror of
conscience; and in like sort it is said that Aaron made the people naked to
their shame when he made a Molten Calf for them to worship as a God, Exodus 32.
25. for by that sin God was departed from them, and so they were made naked
both of Gods graces, and of Gods protection, and the like is expressed in Rev.
3. 18. Rev. 16. 15. Ezekiel. 16. 22. Hos. 2. 3. 2. Cor. 5. 3.

God did purposely enter into a parley and communication with Adam, that thereby
he might prepare him for a Reconciliation, saying to him in ver. 11. Who told
thee that thou art naked? By this and the former searching Queries, God was
pleased to help Adam to search himself the more deeply, and to affect him the
more thoroughly with the sight of his sin, and with the sense of his miserable
spiritual death in sin, because he intended to show him mercy; but the Lord did
not propound any such searching Queries to the fallen Angels, because he
intended not to show any merciful Atonement or Reconciliation to them, though
notwithstanding he has showed some common mercy to them in that he has not
sunk them into the lowest hell as yet, Mat. 8. 29. But judgment without Mercy
to them he has deferred till the Day of Judgment, 2 Pet. 2. 4. 2 These. 1. 9.

And these searching queres made Adam and Eve to answer (as those that are
deeply convinced, and humbled in the sight and sense of their Spiritual
nakedness and misery) that they had eaten of the forbidden Fruit; and they
freely confessed (without any extenuation) after what manner they were brought
unto it; The woman (says Adam, in verse. 12.) which thou gave to be with me,
she gave me of the tree, and I did eat; even she that was made of my Rib, and
she that thou gave to be a meet Helper unto me, Genesis 3. 12. Genesis 3. 13.
she gave it unto me, and therefore I took it from her hand* (from whom I could
suspect no hurt) and did eat.

And the Lord said unto the Woman, what is this that thou have done? or, why
have thou done this? And the Woman said, The Serpent (whom thou gave to
attend upon us, as a diligent and faithful servant) beguiled me, and I did eat,
ver. 13. I thought the Serpent had been acted by a good Angel, that could not
persuade to sin; and by this word Beguiled the woman comprehended the whole
manner and order of the Devils deceitful temptation.

Some Interpreters I grant do conceive, That Adam and Eve in their several
answers, did not make a plain confession, but did rather labor to extenuate
their sin, by posting it off from themselves to others, but all circumstances
considered, their answers and confessions must needs be plain and naked, or
else they had not been fit to embrace the means of Reconciliation which God was
now pleased to manifest unto them.

And therefore without delay God did first curse the Serpent, as it was the
Devils instrument, in verse. 14. and then secondly, he curses the Devil
himself, in ver. 15. saying, I will put enmity between thee and the Woman, and
between thy seed and her seed; He, even He, shall break thy head, and thou
shall pierce Him in the footsoals. Thus God did threaten the Devil in the
Serpent, namely, to break in pieces his subtle Head-plot by the work of
Redemption and Reconciliation, which should be wrought by the Seed of this
Woman, which the Devil had poisoned and corrupted, thinking thereby to destroy
all Mankind that should come of her to the end of the World; but God
threatened the Devil to break this Head-plot of his, and that he would put such
an enmity in the Seed of the Woman against him and his seed, as should prevail,
and bring them all to a deeper ruin at last; and as God did thus curse the
Devils Head-plot to ruinate it by the Seed of the Woman, in the hearing and
presence of Adam and Eve (to whom it was a Prophetical Prediction and a
Promise) so questionless he did not fail to instruct them more fully herein,
and after what manner this Seed of the Woman should break the Devils Head-plot,
namely, that through Death he should destroy him that had the power of Death,
that is the Devil, Hebr. 2. 14. and that he should spoil Principalities and
Powers, and make a show of them openly, triumphing over them in his Death on
the Cross, Col. 2. 15. for he overcame him that had the power of Death by
Death, for his Soul was not separated from his Body by the power of Satan, and
his instruments, and by the power of their tortures, but by his own power, and
in that respect his death was accepted of God as a propitiatory Sacrifice of
Atonement, and reconciliation. This good news of a Reconciliation by this
means was no doubt heartily welcome to poor dejected Adam and Eve; they being
fully lost and condemned in their own Consciences, did out of doubt receive
this Prophetical demonstration of their Redemption, and Reconciliation, with
all gladness and joyfulness of Spirit, for true humbled sinners are fit to take
down such Cordials with joyfulness, and God was pleased to open their minds and
hearts to believe in this Seed of the Woman, and to embrace this blessed means
of their Reconciliation by his Death and Sacrifice, which he should accomplish
in due time, even then when the Devil should pierce him in the Foot-soals upon
the Cross, and by this means God was pleased to Re-create Adam and Eve in the
cool of the same day wherein they were created and fell.

Reas. 2. Secondly, it is evident that Adam and Eve were re-created Adam does
testify that he was Recreated in the day* of his Creation and Fall, by giving
his wife the new name Hevah, life.
in the day of their Creation and Fall, because Adam did testify both his
Wifes faith, and his own faith, by calling her Hevah, Life; for Adam gave this
new Name to his Wife as soon as God had manifested the destroying of Satan's
Head-plot through the work of Reconciliation by the Seed of the Woman.

Before the said threatening to break the Devils Head-plot by the Seed of the
Woman, Adam called his Wifes name Isha, Woman, or of Man, because she was taken
out of man, Genesis 2. 23. but after the said threatening to ruinate the Devils
Head-plot, by reconciling Man by the Seed of the Woman, Genesis 3. 15. then in
verse. 20. Adam called his Wife Hevah, that is to say, Life, because she was the
Mother of Life, Genesis 3. 20. or the Mother of that Seed that gives life from the
death of sin, and in this respect she is also the Mother of all that are
elected to live the life of faith; and from this president it is usual in
Scripture to give new names upon new occasions, especially upon the
manifestation of some new work of Grace upon any, as Genesis 17. 5. Es. 62. 2.
Revel. 3. 12.

Adam was not so senceless to give his Wise the new Name Hevah, because she was
the first living Woman, or the first Mother of Natural life to others, for all
men know that it cannot be otherwise; and therefore it follows by good
consequence, that Adam did give her that new Name by way of excellency, namely,
because she had now received the new life of Faith in that seed of hers, that
should break the Devils Head-plot. And secondly, because she was the first
Woman that did live by faith, therefore she must needs be the Mother of all
that should after live by faith in her Seed Christ, and in that respect she, as
well, or rather more fully than Sara, may well be called the Mother of all that
do live by faith, 1 Pet. 3. 6. Gal. 4. 22. 28. 31.

2 As Adam does testify his Wives faith, so also he does fully testify his
own faith in giving her the new name Hevah; his faith is fully evident by this,
because by this new name he did so clearly distinguish her present new
Spiritual condition from her corrupted condition.

Immediately before this, not only the Woman, but Adam also were Spiritually
dead in corruption and sin; but it pleased God to take such a speedy course for
their humiliation and conviction, and for their reconciliation and conversion
by the Seed of the Woman, that Adam thereupon, in testimony both of his own
faith and of his Wifes faith, did by way of excellency call her Hevah, and so
he changed her name from Isha to Hevah, that is to say, from woman to life.

And thus we have seen how the Seed of the Woman, Christ Jesus, did honor his
first Parents with the life of faith, and as he did honor them, so doubtless
he did continue to honor all his Natural Parents after the flesh (sooner or
latter) with the like honor of the life of faith, and therefore they do ill
that make the several wicked Kings of Solomon's house, in Matthew. 1. to be his
Fathers after the flesh; Christ came not of Solomon's house, as the Apostate
Jews, and some unadvised Christians do hold, but he comes of Solomon's brother
called Nathan (and all his Natural Fathers are laid down in Luke 3.) and I make
no question but he did honor every one of them with the grace of true faith,
according to his first example; and this may teach all good children to honor
their Parents with their best abilities.

Reas. 3. It is evident that Adam and Eve were re-created in The conversion of
our first Parents is recorded in the Woman's enmity against the Serpent and his
Seed.
the day of their Creation and Fall, by the word enmity against the Serpent; I
will (says God) put enmity between thee and the Woman.

At the first the Woman looked upon the Serpent as a faithful and diligent
servant for her good, and that the Angel that gave it speech was a good Angel,
and therefore the Woman was in great amity with them, and with the Serpents
fair and specious persuasions; but now God told the Devil in the Serpent, that
he would from this time forth put enmity instead ^f amity betwixt him and the
Woman* and betwixt both their Seed^* This enmity between the D^vil and the
Woman arises from two contrary Principles:

1 The D^vils enmity against the Woman is, because by her re-creation, and
reconciliation, which was effected by her Seed C^^ist, he was disappointed of
his Head-plot, which was to bring the whole race of Man under his power and
dominion.

2 The Woman's enmity against Satan is manifest^d by seeking the ruin of his
dominion, by advancing the Kingdom and power of Christ in her Soul, by getting
an assurance of her Redemption from Satan's H^ad-plot, reconciliation with God,
pardon of sin, and power against corrupt affections for time to come.

This holy qualification of enmity, which God by his Spirit had now put into
Eves Soul against Satan's Head-plot, is another sure note of her sound
conversion* which was eff^cted and brought to pass in the cool of the
self-same day in which Adam was created, and fell.

D^ubtlesse the Woman did now say in her heart as David once said in Psalm 139.
Do not I (O Jehovah) hate them that hate thee? and am not I grieved for those
that rise up against thee? with perfection of hatred do I hate them, they are
to me for enemies, Psalm. 139. 21, 22.

But though the woman was now converted, reconciled (and justified from the
condemning power of her sins) yet she was not freed from temporal afflictions
and chastisements; and therefore it pleased God to lay upon her certain degrees
of punishment for her humiliation, and upon all her sex for her sake; First,
because she was first in the Transgression, God made her desires subject to her
husband, Genesis 3. 16. Secondly, God made her, and all her Sex, to bring forth
children in pain and sorrow: But notwithstanding these degrees of her
humiliation, God has honored the woman with a certain special honor above
the man, because Jesus Christ the Mediator was conceived, and born of the seed
of the woman alone, without the help of man, and therefore Adam might not
reproach his wise, because she was first in the Transgression; but he must* and
did honor her, because she was to be the chief outwa^d instrument of Christ's
Incarnation. And secondly, because she was made an heir as well as Adam of the
promise of life by faith, 1 Pet. 3. 7. and in that respect there is now no
difference between the male, and the female, but all are one in Christ Jesus,
Gal. 3. 28.

And the woman also may comfort her self in Christ, notwithstanding her painful
travel in Childbirth, that she shall be saved by the promised seed of the
woman, if she continue in faith and love, and sanctification, 2 Timothy 2. 15.

Conclusion.
Having in this Chapter made it evident by three Reasons (as I conceive) that
Adam and Eve were Re-created and effectually converted from Satan to God, in
the day of their Creation and Fall: It follows by good consequence, That God
did not ordain the Sabbath in the time of Adams Innocence* but after his Fall
and Re-creation by the Promised Seed.

CHAP. III.
Proving that Adam and Eve were Re-created before the seventh day, namely, in
the latter part of the sixth day.

I Will labor to make this evident by a double inference:

1 From the word Host, and Finished, Genesis 2. 1. 2 From the word Had made, and
Finished, Genesis 2. 2.
But for the better discerning of the said Inferences, I will first labor to
explain the text in Genesis 2. 1, 2, 3.

Verse. 1. And the Heavens and the Earth were Finished, and all the Host of them.

Verse. 2. And before the seventh day, God had finished the work that he had
made; And he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had made.

Verse 3. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it, because in it he
had rested from all his works which God had created and made.

Two things must be marked for the better understanding of these words.

1 Touching the translation of the word Before, in verse. 2.

2 Touching the circumstance of time: namely, after how much time, or
Chronology of story, the second and third verses concerning the Institution of
the Sabbath must be placed.

1 Touching the translation of the word [ Before] the seventh day, verse. 2.

1 The Seventy Translators translate it thus; In the sixth day God ended all
his works, they put the sixth day into the Text instead of the seventh day, and
this they did, lest the Heathens, at whose request that Translation was made,
should think that God ended his works in the seventh day.

2 Therefore, to prevent this, and such like gross mistakes, I have made
choice to follow Mr. Broughtons correction of the Geneva Translation, where
instead of In the seventh day, he reads Before the seventh day, God had
finished the work that he had made.

He says that the Hebrew Preposition may be translated, sometimes In,
sometimes After, and sometimes Before, as the true sense of each place where it
is used, will best bear it; and accordingly in this place he does translate it,
Before the seventh day, and not In the seventh day* as most suitable to the
sense of this place, For God had finished all his works, namely, all the
several sorts and kinds of creatures, Before the end of the sixth day, Exodus
20. 11. Exodus 31. 17. visible and invisible, Col. 1. 16. And he rested on the
seventh day* (namely from the making of any other new kinds or sorts of
creatures) Exodus 20. 11. Exodus 31. 17. Heb. 44. Therefore it is most agre^able
to the true scope o^ t^is T^xt, to read it Before, rather than In the seventh
day.

2 The word [ Before] is better than the word [ In] because it is more
agreeable to the sense of the words adjoining; for the frame of the next words
are delivered in the Pretertense, Had finished, Had made* etc. These terms do
carry the work of the Creation to have been Finished, not In, but Before the
seventh day; as if Moses in more words had said thus,

That work which God had made but mutably perfect in the former part of the
sixth day* he had also finished it by a Re-creation most certainly perfect,
Before the seventh day; That is to say, in the latter part of the sixth day*

3* Mr. Ainsworth shows that the Preposition In* ought sometimes to be
translated Before, as in Exodus 176. In the eyes of the Elders of Israel, is
better read thus, Before the eyes of the Elders of Israel, likewise in Deuteronomy.
25. 9. She shall spit in his face, is better read thus, She shall spit Before
his face, namely, Before the face of her husbands brother, in way of reproach
to him, because he refused to raise up seed to his brother and so the Hebrew
Doctors do understand her spitting to be, not In, but Before his face upon the
ground, as asign of Reproach to him.

I grant that the letter of this Preposition does differ from that in Genesis 2.
2. but yet by the rules of Grammar they must suffer the like variation, when
there is the like cause, the difference of the letter does nothing alter the
case.

So in the eyes of Jehovah, Deuteronomy. 4. 25* Deuteronomy. 31. 29. is better read thus,
Before the eyes of Jehovah; So in the New Testament it is said, See Ains also
in Genesis 366. and ^. Martyrs Com. pl. p 2. c* 7. on Gen* 2. 2.
In or within the Ark was put the golden p^t of Manna, and Aarons Rod, Heb. 94.
This place may better be translated thus, Before, or By the Ark [not in i^] for
there was nothing put into the A^k but the two Tables of stone only, 1 King*
8. 9.

So then from all these considerations, it is clear that the Hebrew Preposition
ought sometimes to be translated Before, and sometimes After, as well as In,
not only in respect of person and place, but also in respect of time; and
therefore this Text of Genesis 2. 2. ought to be translated thus, Before the
seventh day, God had finished (namely by a Re-creation) the work that he had
made; the Greek translate the work which God had begun to make, for at first it
was made but mutably perfect in the former part of the sixth day.

2 The next considerable Rule of direction for the right understanding of these
three verses, is the circumstance of time, namely after how much of the History
of Adam must these three verses succeed, according to the rule of true
Chronology.

This consideration is a Rule of great importance to find out the true sense of
these three verses.

Answ. My Answer to this Query is this, namely that these three verses must in
order of time be placed at the end of the third Chapter; As it has been well
observed, both by the Hebrew Doctors, and by sundry Christian Writers, as I
have noted it in R. 1. and p. 1. And see also Dr. Leightfoots Chronolgy for
this; and Samuel Torsh^l in his Design about disposing the Bible into an
Harmony, he does in p. 10. direct us to place the three first verses of Genesis 2.
1, 2, 3. at the end of the third Chapter, and so does Mr. Bro. also.

I have also noted in Chap. 18. that the only reason why Moses does place these
three verses at the beginning of the second Chapter is this; namely, because he
had begun to set down the story of all the six working days in Genesis 1.
therefore he thought it meet to set down the story of the seventh day in the
next place; and so he has placed the brief story of all the seven days of the
week together, that so he might take the more liberty afterward to return
again unto the large story of Adams Creation, Fall, and Redemption, from the
seventh verse of the second Chapter to the end of the third Chapter: All which
story fell out upon the sixth day, and therefore the ordination* of the
Sabbath, though it be set in Genesis 2. 2, 3. yet in the order of Chronology, it
must be set after the third Chapter of Genesis.

This consideration may serve as a necessary Rule to guide us in the right
apprehending, and understanding of sundry words in the said three verses, which
else cannot be fully and rightly understood; for we must expound these three
verses as if they had been placed at the end of the third Chapter.

And this is no new device of man's brain, but it is an usual thing for the
Penmen of the holy Scriptures, to make such like dislocations of Chapters and
verses; and in that respect the Hebrew Doctors do say, that there is no Order
of former and latter in the Law, for oftentimes the Penmen of the holy
Scriptures do set that which is after, Before; and so consequently we must by
the rule of Chronology place the Institution of the Sabbath after the third
Chapter, though Moses for the reason aforesaid, has set it in the beginning of
the second Chapter.

So then by this rule of direction, I hope it will be easy to discern that
these* three verses must be expounded with relation to the story of Adams Fall,
Re-creation, and Reconciliation by the Promised-Seed. And therefore it follows
by necessary consequence, that Adams Re-creation by the Seed of the woman, must
be considered as the finishing act of the six days creation, before the
seventh day was ordained to be a Sabbath.

And by this Rule of Exposition, many words also in the said three verses must
be so expounded, as having a holy equivocation in them, namely, as having a
mystical sense, as well as a literal.

As for example, under this word Made and Created, must be understood the
mystical and spiritual Creation, as well as the literal and visible Creation:
And under the word Finished must be understood not only the finishing of the
visible Creation, but of the mystical and spiritual Creation also; which must
be finished, I mean some of that kind, by the Seed of the woman, before the
Host of Heaven can be said to be finished (for the Host of the third heavens
must be finished, as well as the Host of the visible heavens) before the end of
the sixth day.

The like mystical interpretation I shall give of the word Rested, Blessed,
etc. when I come at them.

In brief, I apprehend that there are ten several words in the said three
verses that must be expounded in a mystical sense as well as in a literal.

1 The word Heavens, 2 The word Earth, 3 The word Finished, 4 The word Host, 5
The word Made, 6 The word Rested, 7 The word Blessed, 8 The word Sanctified, 9
The word Sabbath, 10 The word Seventh.
But my work in this Chapter, is only to prove that Adam and Reason 1. Drawn
from Genesis 2. 1. If all the Host of Heaven and Earth were finished before the
seventh day, ^hen it must needs follow that Adam and Eve were Re-created before
the seventh day.
Eve were Re-created before the seventh day; that is to say, in the latter part
of the sixth day; and this I will endeavor to prove by a necessary consequence
drawn from the first verse, which runs thus, And the heavens and the earth were
finished, and all the Host of them.

Hence I reason thus,

If all the several sorts and kinds of creatures which appertained to the Host
of Heaven and Earth were finished before the seventh day; then Adam and Eve
were Re-created before the seventh day: for Gods Host was not finished until
some of that sort of creatures were finished, which did appertain to the Host
of the Church Militant here upon earth, and to the Host of the Church
Triumphant in heaven.

But all the several sorts and kinds of creatures which appertained to the
Host of heaven and earth were finished before the seventh day, as the text does
plainly speak.

Therefore Adam and Eve were Re-created before the seventh day, and did
appertain to the Host of the Church Militant here on earth, and to the Host of
the Church Triumphant in heaven before the seventh day, or else God did not
finish all the Host of heaven and earth before the seventh day, which is to
deny and contradict the words of the Holy Ghost.

It is out of question therefore that the souls of Adam and Eve were Re-created,
and made perfect by the Redemption of the Promised Seed before the seventh day
for that sort of creature does appertain to the heavenly Host as well as the
Angels, and to Gods spiritual Host and Church here upon earth, and in that
respect the godly converts are called (by the Figure Continent for the for the
thing contained) The new Heavens, and the new Earth, in which dwells
Righteousness, 2 Pet. 3. 13.

And it i^ further evident that such redeemed persons are a true part of Gods
Host here upon earth, because the Scripture calls the Church of Israel when it
was redeemed out of Egypt, the Lords Host, Exodus 12. 41. Exodus 38. 8. Number. 1.
3. And wicked Antiochus is said to tread down Gods Host or Army underfoot when
he persecuted the Church, Dan. 8. 14. yea all, and every part of Gods Militant
Church here upon earth is called Gods Host or Army, Psalm. 110. 3.

Adam and Eve therefore must not only fall into the spiritual death of sin, in
the day of their creation, but they must also be Re-created the same day, as a
principal sort of those creatures, which God did create and provide, both for
his earthly, and also for his heavenly Host; for the Text says, That the
Heavens and the Earth were finished, and all the Host of them: which must be
understood of every several sort of Host, not numerically of the whole number,
but specifically of the several kinds of each Host, for no new thing of a new
kind was created after the sixth day.

Therefore seeing God did finish all the Host of heaven and earth before the
seventh day, he must needs Re-create Adam and Eve before the seventh day, that
so they might be a part of his Militant Church, Host, or Army, here upon earth,
to maintain an utter enmity against Satan and his seed, Genesis 3. 15. and so
from the first sixth day, and forwards, God will have a Militant Church to
continue here upon earth to fight the warfare of Christ against Satan and his
seed to the end of the world.

Reason* 2. It is further evident that Adam was Re-created by the Promised Seed
in the day of his creation, by another Inference, Reason 2. If God had made
something in the former part of the sixth day that needed a new act of
finishing before the seventh day, then wh^t else can that finishing act be, but
Adams Recreation by the Promised Seed
taken from the word Had finished, as it is joined to the word Had made, verse.
2.

From the frame of these words as they are laid down in the Pretertense it is
evident, that before the seventh day, namely in the latter part of the sixth
day, God had finished some of that work which he had made but mutably perfect
in the former part of the sixth day; Hence I reason thus,

God had made some of his works so mutably perfect in the former part of the
sixth day, that there needed a new act of finishing, or perfecting the same
before the seventh day; and what else can that finishing act be, but Adams
Re-creation by the Promised Seed, and the putting of all the re rest of the
Creation at the very instant of Adams fall under the Dominion and Lordship of
the Promised Seed?

And this must needs be so, because God had made, appointed, or fore ordained
Christ to be the right Heir of all his Creation, and uphold all things by the
word of his powerful providence, Heb. 1. 2, 3. and in that respect, Adam must
fall and be Re-created on the day of his creation, that so the right Heir
Christ Jesus might come into actual possession of all the Creation, by means
whereof, the Heavens and the Earth, and all their Host, was finished, before
the seventh day; and in this respect Christ is eminently styled Jehovah
Sabbath, that is to say, The Lord of all Hosts, Ps. 24. 10. because they were
made for his service, that he as their proper Lord might rule them, and govern
them all, for it is said, See also chapter 4 and chapter 6 at Sixthly.
That by him all things consist, Col. 1. 17. and in this respect also, he is
called The Lord of all the whole world, and of all things therein, Jos. 3. 11.
Act. 10. 36. Phi. 2. 11. Ps. 24. 1. Neh. 9. 6. To him also does appertain the
Dominion of the Heavens, and of the heaven of heavens, the earth, and all that
is in them, Deuteronomy. 10. 14, 15. And because all Government is his, therefore it
is from him that Kings do reign and rule, Prove. 8. 15, 16.

It follows therefore that God ordained Christ to be the right Heir, and sole
Governor of all the Hosts both of heaven and earth, on the sixth day, and
before God could be said to rest on the seventh day.

1 God made Adam in the former part of the sixth day after his own Image, as
the glory of all his Creation, and gave him Dominion over all his visible
creatures, Genesis 1. 26. 28. But it pleased God in his divine Wisdom, to make
Adam but mutably happy, that so he might fall by the sleight of Satan, and
lose his pure qualities wherein he was created after Gods Image, and that he
might thereby also lose his Dominion over all the visible Creation, that so
Christ the right Heir might have the possession of all, for as soon as Adam
fell by his disobedience in eating the forbidden fruit, both Adam, and all the
Creation did presently fall into confusion and disorder: And thereupon Satan
might well triumph, and boast as he did in the days of Job, that he had walked
to and sro in the earth as the Lord and Conqueror of it, because he had not
only brought Adam and Eve into Captivity under the spiritual death of sin, and
the whole Creation into confusion and disorder, but also because he had robbed
the holy Trinity of all the glory of their glorious Creation.

2 God was pleased in his infinite Wisdom and Providence to let all this come
to pass, that so the holy Trinity might take occasion thereby to declare unto
fallen Man, how wonderful they were in Counsel, and how excellent in working,
in that they could tell how to make Man mutably perfect, and how to let Man
fall by the sleight of Satan, and how to break the Devils Head-plot by the
promised Seed, and how to reconcile and recreate Man, and how to make fallen
Man know, and honor his Creators, more than otherwise he could ever have done,
if he had stood still in his first integrity of Nature; for if Adam had still
continued in his Created perfections, he could not have honored the Mediator
(so as he did after his Fall) seeing he needed not a Mediator in that
condition; neither could he have so much honored Gods Mercy in the Mediator as
he did after his Fall and Re-creation.

3 By this time I think any man may easily see the reason why all the three
Persons in the Godhead had a hand in the Creation of the World, and more
eminently in the Creation of Man, Genesis 1. 26. surely the chief reason was, That
God might make Adam in his Innocence could not so well honor all his Creators
as after his Fall and Re-creation.
Adam by his Fall and Recreation the better able to know, and honor all the
three Persons in the Godhead as his Creators, for Adam could not honor all
his Creators so well in his Innocence as after his Fall and Re-creation, and in
this respect all the three Persons in the Godhead are called our Creators,
Eccles. 12. 1. Psalm. 149. 2. and our Makers, Job 35. 10. Es. 54. 5. and truly
such Creators could not rest on the Seventh Day from all the Works which they
had Created and made, until they had made man to know them to be their Creators
by a Re-creation, which Adam could not do as long as he stood in his Innocence;
but as soon as his Creation was finished and made perfect by a Re-creation,
then fallen man both knew and honored all his Creators; and the Mediator in
special to be the Mediator of his Re-creation, of his Reconciliation, and
eternal Redemption, and then God rested on the Seventh Day, because he had
finished his Creation by the promised Seed.

4 After Adams fall it pleased God so to question with Adam about his miserable
condition by his Fall, that he made him sensible of his misery; and then it
pleased God to make his Mercy known to him in the Mediator. It was a terror to
the Devil to hear, that the Seed of the Woman should break his head, Genesis 3.
15. but because it was a great comfort to fallen Adam, for God declared the
Mediator both in his Person and Office to fallen Adam, and by Gods description
Adam could not choose but know that his Person must needs be both God and Man;
he could not choose but know, that he that must break the Devils Head-plot must
needs be God, and that he that must be born of the Seed of the Woman must needs
be Man, and then for his Office he could not choose but know, that it must be a
Mediatorial office of reconciliation, or else such a miserable sinner as be
could never be restored again into Gods favor.

In all these respects fallen Adam could not choose but know, and honor the
Father for his great Mercy, in propounding such a Mediator; and he could not
choose but know, and honor the Mediator of his Redemption more than if he had
stood still in his innocence; and he could not choose but know and honor the
Holy Ghost, because his heart and mind was recreated, and made new by the
sanctifying work of the Holy Ghost for the sake of the Mediator, 1 Pet. 1, 2.
Fallen Adam of himself had no skill, nor will, to find out a Mediator, till
the Holy Ghost did enable him to believe that the Seed of the Woman should one
day give his Soul as a Mediatorial Sacrifice of atonement (even then when the
Devil should pierce him in the foot-soals) for the procuring of his Fathers
reconciliation, by which he should be eternally redeemed from the Curse due to
his disobedience, and from the guilt of his sin, and so be received into Gods
favor as his adopted son.

O the infinite Wisdom of God, that could tell how to augment man's happiness,
and his own praise, by Adams sinful disobedience! if Adam had continued still
in his innocence he should have been continued only in his Natural perfections,
and have been a Lord above all the rest of the visible Creation; but in that
condition he could not have so much honored all his Creators as he did after
his recreation; neither should he have attained to that degree of happiness as
after his Fall, by the Mediator; neither could the Holy Trinity have been so
glorious is his Soul as they were after his Fall and recreation.

5 This sentence, before the seventh day God had finished the work that he had
made, is a remarkable sentence, full of Spiritual weight and worth, because it
imports, that though Adam and Eve were created but mutably perfect in the
former part of the sixth day, yet that they were recreated and made perfect by
the promised Seed in the latter part of that day, namely before the seventh
day, and that this finishing act of Gods Creation by a Recreation was the
perfection of the whole Creation, so that nothing could be added to it
afterward, to make the Creation The Creation of the Human Nature of Christ in
the latter part of the sixth day, was the perfection of the whole Creation.
more perfect to the worlds end; for by the Creation of the Human nature of
Christ, of the Seed of the Woman (which must be created in the sixth day) for
it is a Creature, and therefore it was truly existing in that Prophetical
declaration of it, Genesis 3. 15. I say, this addition to the Creation in the cool
of the sixth day, made the whole Creation perfect and entire, lacking nothing,
and so much the word had made, and had finished, must import; namely, it must
import such a finishing act and perfection of all the Creation, as must have as
full and as large a The Mystical as well as the Natural Creation was finished,
and made, before the Seventh day, and therefore Adam and Eve were re-created
before the seventh day.
sense as can be contained in the Scriptures; namely, it must have a Mystical
sense as well as a Literal, John says, Chap. 1. 3. All things were made by
him, even all things without exception that were made, were made by him in six
days, therefore we must not leave any sort of Creature out of the Work of those
six days, excepting him that did create them; so that whatever Mystical thing
is found in any part of the Scripture to be Created by God, in relation to Man,
or to the Mediator, it must be included as a particular Commentary, or
Exposition of these terms, had finished, had made, had created Before the
seventh day.

Arius denied Christ to be of the same nature with his Father, See the Sum of
Divinity, by Jo. Dowuham, p. 35. See also more here in chapter 5.
and made him only a Creature, yet he held him to be an excellent Creature (and
as it were a secondary God) Created before the World, and by whom God Created
the World, and saved Mankind, and therefore as a God in Office to be adored,
not in Essence. The like he says of the Holy Ghost.

But seeing it is plain that God made all Creatures in six days, both the Son
and the Spirit (if they were Creatures) must have been comprehended in that
work. Hence I infer, that seeing the Human nature of Christ was a Creature
(and differing much from fallen man, because he was conceived by the Holy
Ghost) it must be comprehended in the Creation of the sixth day; and therefore
his Human nature did exist in that Prophetical declaration of being made of the
Seed of the Woman to break the Serpents head.

John says, All things were made by him, (even his own Human nature) and
without him was nothing made that was made, John 1. 3. and the Apostle makes
Christ as Mediator to be the first of all things, that he might be the Head of
his Body the Church, that in all things he might have the pre-eminence,
therefore Adam and Eve must be Re-created in the day of their Creation, that so
from that day forward Christ might be the Head of his Body the Church, that in
all things he might have the pre-eminence, Col. 1. 15. to 19. and in this
respect also Christ is said to save us, and to call us by a holy Calling before
the world was, 2 Timothy 1. 9. because he was ordained to his Office before the
world was.

6 The very frame of the words in Genesis 22. (being delivered so often in the
pretertence) may assure us, that not only the first natural being, or existing
of the Creation is meant, but that the very best supernatural being thereof is
also meant; for if the adding of some Common gifts to Nature be called a
Creation, Eze. 28. 14, 15. then the super-adding of saving gifts to fallen man,
must needs be esteemed as the highest degree of all Gods Creation, as these
Scriptures do testify, Ier. 33. 26. Ezekiel. 43. 1. 7. 15. 21. Es. 44. 2. Ephesians.
2. 10. Psalm. 100. 3. Psalm. 102. 18. Hence it follows, that seeing the Heavens
and the Earth were finished after they had been made, it must be understood
that they were finished by the Redemption and Gubernation of the promised Seed*
before the seventh Day, and therefore that Adam and Eve must necessarily be
recreated on the sixth day, and so (by the Figure Synedoche, and also by the
figure Continent for the thing contained) they must be a part of the New
Heavens, and of the New Earth, as well as all other re-created Souls are, Es.
51. 16. Es. 65. 17* 18. Es. 66. 22. Es. 41. 20. Psalm. 96. 11. 2 Pet. 3. 13.
Rev. 21. 1.

The finishing act of that which God had created in the end of the sixth day by
the promised Seed, may well be resembled to the finishing act of the Temple by
Joash and Jehoiada, they employed faithful Workmen to repair it, after that
wicked Athaliah had destroyed it, and then it is said, That a Healing went up
upon the work, 1 Chro. 24. 13. that is to say, the breaches and decays thereof
were healed, repaired, and amended; for to heal a thing is to repair it, or to
make it perfect and sound again, 2 Chro. 7. 14. Psalm. 60. 2. 2 Chro. 34. 10.
and thus the Temple which had been made was re-created, finished, and perfected
by those faithful men, ver. 14.

In like sort, after that Satan by his malicious Head-plot had ruinated, and
broken down that glorious Temple-work of Gods Creation, by enticing Adam and
Eve to eat the forbidden Fruit, then God laid help upon one that was able and
faithful to repair it, for in the end of the sixth day God told the Devil by
way of threatening, and Adam and Eve by way of Promise, That the Seed of the
Woman should break this Head-plot of the Devil, by his Mediatorial obedience,
when he should make his Soul a propitiatory Sacrifice for his sin, even at the
same time when the Devil should pierce him in the foot-soals as a sinful
Malefactor; now God could not declare this but by his Sons pre-consent,
contract, and Covenant, upon his undertaking Gods Atonement, or Reconciliation
was procured, and the holy Spirit was procured thereby also for Adams
re-creation, and so a Healing went up upon the Creation by this faithful
Workman, and blessed Mediator Christ Jesus, the strong Rock, whose work is
perfect, Deuteronomy. 32. 4. and in this respect the Apostle Peter calls the Mediator
the faithful Creator, 1 Pet. 4. 19. whose work is perfect, but Peter's Greek
(Ctistes) is borrowed from the seventy, on 1 Samuel 22. and Psalm. 18. 2. where
the Hebrew is Rock, and there it is the attribute of the Mediator; and Christ
told his Apostles, that he would build his Church upon that Rock, and that the
gates of Hell should not overcome it, Mat. 16. 18.

Master Perkins on the Creed, page 154. says, God is called the faithful
Creator, 1 Pet. 4. 19. because he did not leave his Works of Creation without
his faithful care and providence, as Masons and Carpenters leave their Houses
as soon as they are built, without any further care what becomes of them, for
God is a faithful Creator, that will not let his Creation go to ruin.

Thus we see that Adam and Eve were twice Created in one day; 1. They were made
perfect, but yet mutable in the former part of the sixth day (as it appeared)
for presently by the sleight of Satan they lost their first Created
perfections. 2. God did Re-create them with supernatural perfections by the
promised Seed, in the end of the same day; and this Creation was permanent,
because it was a Creation of God in Christ Jesus, Ephesians. 2. 10. and because
Christ undertook to make all perfect, therefore God rewarded Christ for this
his work, for at the same time the Lord put the whole Creation in subjection
under the feet of Christ; and when all this was done, then the whole Creation
was perfect, and entire, lacking nothing, and therefore Gods rest on the
Seventh Day was a perfect rest; But if God had kept his rest on the Seventh day
whiles Adam had stood in his mutable condition, as some Expositors would have
him to do, then Gods rest (especially on the first Sabbath) had stood but upon
a ticklish and litigious foundation.

CHAP. IV.
That this Sentence [Before the Seventh Day God had finished the Work that he
had made] does imply, That God, by his Eternal Counsel and Providence (as the
efficient cause) had contrived to put out sundry opperations of his Eternal
Providence in the sixth day, for the finishing, or perfect se^ling of all that
Work which he had made but mutably perfect at first, before he could keep a
perfect rest on the Seventh Day.

God did put out sundry operations of his eternal providence in the sixth day,
for the finishing of that work which he had created but mutably perfect, before
he could be said to keep a perfect rest on the seventh day, The reason why God
made Angels but mutably perfect at first was, that they might fall, and so
might become the instrument of Man's fall.
BY the event of things now made known unto us, we may in some sort see into the
Platform of Gods eternal Providence, how he had contrived to finish or perfect
that Work that at the first he had made, and created, but mutably perfect,
before he could keep the Seventh Day as a day of perfect rest.

If God by his eternal Counsel and Providence had not contrived to make Angels
mutably perfect as well as Man, then Angels had not despised to attend upon
Adam and Eve into Paradise (as their charge was) and then Angels had not become
Devils, and then Man had not been tempted by Satan, and then man had not
fallen, and then God had foreordained a Mediator in vain.

Therefore that God might make his Free grace glorious to fallen Man, and that
he might make the Mediator glorious to the Souls of the Elect, he made Adam at
the first but mutably perfect, that so he might fall, and that so he might take
occasion thereby to convince him, and humble him in the fight of his sin and
misery, and that so he might take occasion thereby to reveal unto his Soul the
way of eternal Salvation by the Seed of the Woman.

And for the more speedy effecting of all this, he did by his eternal Counsel
and Providence appoint his heavenly Angels, as well as his terrestrial
Creatures, to attend upon Adam and Eve into Paradise, for he fore-knew that if
he did but give his heavenly Angels charge to attend upon earthly Man, with
other earthly Creatures into Paradise, that many Legions of them would despise
Man in comparison of themselves, and would neglect their charge, that so in
Justice God might deprive them of their pure Natural qualities, and then he
knew that they would become an envious company against the glory of Man, and
that they would agree together in one deep Head-plot (altogether unseen to Man)
to seduce him, and persuade him to eat of the forbidden Fruit, that so they
might be brought into the same Spiritual death with themselves; and by this
speedy Headplot of theirs they made account not only to corrupt Adam and Eve,
but also to destroy the whole Generation of all Mankind.

But God that was wise in Counsel, and wonderful in Working, who works all
things after the Counsel of his own Will, Ephesians. 1. 11. had contrived how to break
this Head-plot of the Devil in pieces by the Seed of the Woman; this Divine
Headplot the Angels that fell knew not of, for if they had but known it, then
they would not have refused to attend upon Adam and Eve into Paradise; and thus
God by his eternal Counsel and Providence had contrived how to make this
Head-plot of the Devil to be an occasion to declare his goodness to fallen Man,
both the goodness of Justice, and the goodness of Mercy, by making the Person
and office of the Mediator better known, and more admired and honored of
fallen Man, than if Adam had stood still in his innocence.

As soon therefore as Adam was fallen, God took occasion thereby to introduce
the Mediator into his Priestly Office virtually, that so he might reconcile and
redeem Man, and put him into a better estate again than he had by his first
Creation, and that thereby God might put all the rest of his Creation under the
Government of Christ, as the true Lord, and proper Heir of all things, for all
things were created for him, Col. I. 16. or else if he had not restrained sin,
and been pre-ordained to be the Heir of all things, and to be ready at hand to
take the Government of all upon him at Adams Fall, the whole Creation had been
instantly confounded by a general Rebellion, and by a total Disorder, which was
the main thing that the Devil aimed at in his Head-plot, but it was prevented,
because he had ordained Christ to be the right Heir of all, to undertake the
Government of all at the very instant of Adams Fall, and so his Mercy is over
all his Works, as the Hen is over her Chickens, Psa. 145.

From the Premises I reason thus:

The whole Creation was made at first for that very end for which it now
serves, Psalm. 119. 91.

But now all the whole Creation serves to the honor of the Mediator, for God
has laid the Government of the whole Creation upon his Shoulders, Es. 9. 6, 7.
and has given him dominion over the Works of his hands, and has put all
things under his feet, Psalm. 8. 6. 1 Cor. 15. 24. to 28. and in that he has
put all things in subjection under him, he left nothing that should not be
subject to him, Hebr. 2. 8.

Therefore God had foreordained the Mediator, to restrain the violence of
corrupted Nature, and to take upon him the right of Government, as the right
Heir of all things, even from the first moment of Man's Fall, for all things
were created for him, Col. 1. 16. and therefore God could not keep a Sabbath of
rest until he had put the right Heir into actual possession, and in that
respect Christ is styled the Lord of all Hosts, Psalm. 24. 10. because all the
Hosts of Heaven and Earth were put under his Dominion, even from the day of
Man's creation; and in that respect als^ Christ is styled and called, The
beginning of the creation of God, Rev. 3. 14, Col. 1. 15. Psalm. 102. 26. Heb.
2. 10. for he was ordained before all things, and by him all things do
consist, Col. 1. 17. Heb. 2. 10. 1 Cor. 8. 6.

And this Dominion of the Mediator all creatures do, and have acknowledged ever
since the fall of Adam; and therefore the four and twenty Elders do cast down
their Crowns before him, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and
honor, and power, for thou have created all things, and for thy pleasures sake
they are, and were created, Rev. 5. 11, 12, 13. Psalm. 145, 10, 11, 12. Pla. 89.
5. and Rev 5. 11, 12, 13. See also chapter 6 at Sixthly.
our Savior Christ does still comfort his afflicted people with the constancy
of his providence, for their good, saying, I have made thee (namely by a
Re-creation) and I will bear thee (namely by my constant fatherly providence)
Es. 64. 4. yea Christ by his overruling providence does create, and make the
wicked to serve for his glory, and for his Churches good, by limitting and
ord^ring all their wicked actions; Behold (says Christ) I have created the
Smith, and I have created the Destroyer to destroy, Es. 64. 16. yea Christ does
order the very devils by his overruling providence, so that they cannot be so
malicious, as else they would be against man, as we may see in the case of Job.
So then, both Deceivers, and Deceived, all are from Him, and by Him, and for
Him, Romans 11. 35. Job 12. 16. And thus we see that God has put all things
under the feet of Christ according to the purpose of him who works all things
after the counsel of his own will, Ephesians. 1. 11. Act. 2. 23. And therefore it
follows, that God by his eternal Providence did ordain a Mediator against the
day of Adams fall, Ephesians. 1. 4. 1 Pet. 1. 20. 2 Timothy 1. 9. by whose Redemption
and Gubernation, the whole Creation was finished, perfected, settled, and
ordered before the seventh day; and therefore these terms (he had finished, and
had made before the 7th* day) do imply, that Christ the Mediator did put out
sundry operations of his eternal Providence in the sixth day for the finishing
and perfect settling of all the Creation (which at first he had made but mutably
perfect) before he could keep a contented settled rest on the seventh day. Mr.
Perkins on the Creed, Page 159. says, One of the greatest works of Gods
providence that can be, is about man's Fall and Restoration; First, by the just
permission of his Fall, Romans 11. 32. And secondly, by destroying this head-plot
of the Devil, Gal. 322.

CHAP. V.
That this term [which he had made, Genesis 2. 2.] has relation to the Creation
of the Mediator, in two particulars; 1 In regard of his Office as a Mediatorial
Priest. 2 In regard of his Humane nature.

GOD having provided a Mediator, by his eternal Providence, God created or
installed the Mediator into his Priestly office before he could keep a perfect
rest on the seventh day.
against the day of Adams fall, for his Reconciliation, and Re-creation, was
pleased accordingly to exhibit the said Mediator to Adam in a gracious
declaration thereof to him, but yet it was in a way of threatening to the
Serpent, that this Mediator should be the seed of that deceived Woman, and that
he should break his head-plot, Genesis 3. 15. namely by his propitiatory
sacrifice, or sacrifice of Atonement, even at the same time when the Devil by
his instruments should put him to death by peircing him in the foot-soals as a
sinful Malefactor on the Cross; and now God did not only threaten the Devil
to break his headplot, and not only comfort Adam with the assurance of his
Redemption, but also he said to his Son, This day have I begotten thee, or
created thee into the office of a Priestly Mediator, Heb. 5. 5. with Psalm. 2.
7. 8. and in this sense God is said to make or create Moses and Aaron when he
installed them into the office of deliverers, The humane nature of Christ was
created and virtually made flesh of the s^ed of the wom^n before God could be
said to keep a perfect rest on the seventh day. See John Frith against Sir Tho.
Moor p. 109.
1 Samuel 12. 6. and in this sense God could not keep a perfect rest on the
seventh day until he had created the Mediator into his Priestly office.

2 The humane nature of Christ was created, and exhibited in a gracious
declaration of Adams redemption (from the Devils Head-plot by the seed of the
Woman) as the perfection of all the Creation on the sixth day, his humane
nature is a creature, and therefore it was virtually made flesh of the seed of
the woman, before it could be said, That God had finished all his works which
he had created and made; and therefore before he could keep a perfect rest on
the seventh day.

Christ was as truly made flesh of the seed of the Virgin Eve on the sixth day,
as he was made flesh of the seed of David, Romans 1. 3. and his flesh was as
truly eaten by faith of Adam and Eve, and of all the godly Fathers that offered
Sacrifices of Atonement by faith, as it is eaten by us now; for this
Proposition is general, and belongs to the godly in all ages from the first
Promise, That unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, ye can have no life
in you, Joh. 6. 53. And for the confirmation of this first Promise (that Christ
should be made flesh of the seed of the woman) Christ did often appear to the
Fathers in the shape of a man, Genesis 32. 24. Prove. 8. 31. to assure them, that
as he was truly exhibited in a gracious promise to our first Parents, so he
would in due time take our nature upon him; and in this respect the humane
nature of Christ was called by the Prophet Jeremy, A new created thing in the
Earth, A Virgin shall compass a man, Jer. 31. 22.

This whole Chapter is a Prophecy of the days of the Messiah (as any
considerate Reader may easily discern) I put in the term Virgin, instead of our
translated term Woman, and yet I find no fault with the term Woman, provided
the interpretation be of a Virgin-Woman; but if the term Woman be taken for one
that has a Husband, in that sense I dislike the term, for it is no new cre^ted
thing for a woman that has a husband to compass a man-child in her womb.

2 I dissent from them that think the word Compass does mean the crafty
fetches of an immodest woman, seeking as an agent to circumvent some man or
other into the bond of marriage; This Interpretation cannot stand, because this
is no new created thing.

3 I dissent from them that make this Woman to be the generality of the Jews
that shall conquer the great Empire of the Turks, for this new device does not
make this new created thing.

But to me it is most evident that this new created thing is nothing else but
the humane nature of Christ encompassed in the womb of a Virgin; First, of the
Virgin Eve; And secondly, of the Virgin Mary: And at this new created thing, no
doubt but Adam and Eve did as much wonder, as the Angels did at the hanging of
the earth upon nothing, Job 38. 7. yea this new created thing may justly ravish
both Men and Angels with wonderment, as it does, 1 Timothy 3. 16. 1 Pet. 1. 12.
Exodus 25. 20.

By this Vision the Prophet Jeremy did call backsliding Israel to consider this
new created thing (saying, by way of wonderment at their unbeleef) How long
will thou ga about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the Lord has created a
new thing in the earth, A Vi^gin-woman shall compass a man.

Hence it is evident, that if this backsliding Daughter had but duly considered
this new created thing, it would have wrought true conversion in them as well
as it did in Adam and Eve (But who has believed our report, says the Prophet
in the like case, Es. 53. 1. Isaiah would have cured wicked Ahaz his unbeleef
with this sign, Es. 7. 14, but this new created thing did not work admiration
in his affections, as it did in Adam and Eve, and therefore it did him no good.

After Jeremy had propounded this new created thing for the conversion of
backsliding Israel, he said, I awaked, and behold my sleep was sweet unto me,
Jer. 31. 26. it wrought sweet affections of joy in the consideration of it; But
if Jeremy had conceived as some Interpreters do, that this woman had been a
subtle immodest woman, then I marvel how he could have had any sweet content
in that consideration when he awoke.

By this woman therefore I do not only understand the Virgin Mary, that did
actually compass the Humane nature of Christ in her womb, but I do also
understand the Virgin Eve that did virtually compass him in her womb by faith,
for God did exhibit the Messiah to her in a gracious Proposition in the cool of
the sixth day while she was a Virgin; And it is remarkable that the Prophet
Jeremy does speak of this new created thing both in the time past, and also in
the time to come; Behold, says he, the Lord has created a new thing in the
earth (and in the next clause he speaks of it as of a thing to come) A Virgin
shall compass a man, or a man-child (for a man-child is called A man, Job 3.
2. Joh. 16. 21.)

So then this phrase, Ged had finished his work which he had made before the
seventh day, includes all this that I have spoken of the Humane nature of
Christ, as I have also noted it in Chap. 3. R. 2.

Also the extent of this term created and made is very large, for it is often
applied to things that are new, mavelous, and glorious, Es. 65. 18. Ex. 34.
10. Number. 16. 30. also it is applied to Gods powerful acts, Deuteronomy 3 24. and to
things that are done in a miraculous manner above nature, Joh. 2. 9. In all
which regards the humane nature of Christ, (as it was compassed in the womb of
a Virgin that never knew man) may well be called a glorious, powerful, and
miraculous new created thing in the earth to the sound conversion of a true
considerate heart.

2 This new created thing the Prophet Agur does make to be the greatest wonder
of all the four which he does name, and compare together, in Prove. 30. 18, 19.

Three things (says he) are too wonderful for me, yea four that I know not; 1
The way of an Eagle in the air. 2 The way of a Serpent from a Rock. 3 The way
of a ship in the midst of the Sea. And 4 The way of a man in a Virgin. The
Hebrew word which is translated Woman in this place, does properly signify
such a woman as never knew man by carnal generation. This Hebrew word is never
used for a polluted Adultresse as some would have it to mean in this place. 2
Neither is this Hebrew word used for a married woman, but always for a Virgin
that never knew man: Examine the several places where this Hebrew word is used,
and that will confirm the truth of my observation; It is used but six times
only in Scripture, Genesis 24. 43 Ps. 68. 25. Cant. 1. 2. Cant. 6. 7. Es. 7. 14.
Prove. 30. 19. in the first five places no question is made by any to the
contrary; all the question is about this last place in Prove. 30. 19. and yet if
the scope of the Prophet Agur in this Chapter be well marked, there is no more
question of this place, than of the rest; for in this Chapter the Prophet Agur
does speak of Christ in our nature, and calls him Ithiel and Vcall, verse. 1.
Mr. Broughton in Ecclesiastes, page 11. says, that Agur speaks of Gods
dwelling in Christ named Ithiel and Vcall, which signifies God with me, even
the mighty; so that we see the Prophet Agur does call the Mediator Ithiel and
Vcall in the very same sense that Esaias calls him Immanuel; the notation is much
alike in both places.

Therefore seeing the Prophet Agur does speak of Christ in our nature in the
forefront of this Prophecy, what lets but that he may speak also of his
wonderful strange conception in the womb of a Virgin? the wonderfulnesse
whereof he does illustrate by way of comparison to three other things that are
beyond the power of humane reason to find out; For first, who can find out the
pathway where a ship has gone in the midst of the Sea? Or secondly, the
pathway where an Eagle has flown in the midst of the air? Or thirdly, the
pathway of a Serpent from the Rock: Put fourthly, who can find out how a Man
child can be conceived in the womb of a Virgin that never knew man? the Prophet
Agur makes this fourth thing a greater wonder than the other three. And this
last the Prophet Jeremy calls a new created thing in the earth; and seeing all
sorts of creatures were created in six days, it follows, that this new created
thing of the humane nature of Christ in the womb of a Virgin, was created and
exhibited to fallen Adam and Eve in a gracious Propetical D^claration on the
sixth day, before that God could keep a perfect rest on the seventh day.

CHAP. VI.
Proving, that the whole world was made for the Honor of the Mediator, as the
right Heir of all; 1 Hence it follows, That God could not keep a perfect Rest
on the seventh day, until he had put the Mediator, as the right Heir of all,
into his possession. 2 Hence follows, That Adam must fall, and be Re-created on
the day of his Creation. This is proved by an induction of some pariiculars.

1 THe Angels were made to serve the Mediator even at he was ordained to be the
seed of the woman, Psalm. 91. 11, 12. Heb. 1. 6. and therefore they did sing for
joy, not only at the birth of Christ when he was born of the Virgin Mary,
Luke. 2. 14. But doubtl^sse, they did as much rejoice to hear that joyful news
to fallen Adam and Eve, that he should be the seed of the woman to break the
Devils Head-plot; and ever since that day they desire to pry into that joyful
and glorious mystery, 1 Timothy 3. 16. 1 Pet. 1. 12.

2 The woman was in a special manner made for the Honor of the Mediator, as
well as for Admas Society, and Posterity; for without the woman's seed, Christ
could not have been promised to be the seed of the woman that was fallen, and
that her seed should break the Devils Head plot, Genesis 3. 15.

3 The Sabbath was made for the Honor of the Mediator, for he was Lord of the
Sabbath, even as he was the Son of Man, Mar. 2. 28

4 The distinction of the natural day into Morning and Evening was so contrived
by Gods providence for the Honor of the Mediator, for the glad tidings of his
Propitiatory Sacrifice was constantly remembered, and typified by the Morning
and Evening, Sacrifices; for that division of the day into morning and evening
is a differing division from day and night (as I have showed at large in my
book of Holy Time) and therefore according to the usual time of the Evening
Sacrifice Christ performed his Propitiatory Sacrifice of Atonement, about the
midst of the first Evening, for the first natural Evening begins at Midday at
the first declining of the Sun, and continues till Sunset, where the night
begins, and in the midst of this evening, namely about three a clock in the
afternoon, Christ made his soul an Evening Sacrifice of man's Redemption.

5 The several sorts of Beasts and Fowls were made for the Honor of the
Mediator; and though some of them were by Gods Providence to be of a ravenous
kind, namely as soon as Adam fell, yet they could not destory fallen man from
the face of the earth, neither could they wholly destory their fellowcreatures
that were of a tame kind, because the Lord God had ordained a Mediator to be
the right Heir of them all, and to rule them all (by restraining their corrupt
desires, and guiding them) as soon as Adam fell, so that the hungry Lions could
not devour Daniel without his license; and as for the rest of the creatures
which were ordained to be of a more quiet and harmless kind, God called them
clean Beasts, and some of them he ordained for the use of Sacrifices, as the
fittest to typifie the innocence of Christ's humane nature, and the perfection
of his Sacrifice.

6 All sorts of creatures were made for the Honor of the Mediator; and
therefore as soon as Adam fell, God put all things in subjection under his
feet, And there was nothing that was not made subject un^o him, Heb. 2. 8.
Psalm. 8. 6. Col. 1. 16. Ephesians. 1. 22.

Yea, God made him the head over the spirits of just men made perfect by the
Fathers forgiveness, that is to say, by the Fathers justification, Heb. 12.
23. and that Dominion is called the first or the chief^st Dominion, Mic. 4. 8.
and this Dominion God gave him in the day of Adams Fall and Re-creation.

Yea all creatures in general do yield obedience unto the Mediator as their
proper Lord and Governor, Rev. 5. 13. as I have noted more at large in Chap.
3. R. 2. and in Chap. 4.

Yea when the Mediator was here upon earth in his humane nature, all creatures
obeyed him as their Lord; for he rebuked the boisterous winds, and the raging
sea, and they obeyed him; He commanded the liquid waters to bear him as the dry
land, and they obeyed him; He commanded a hundred fifty three great fishes to
come into Peter's Net, and not to break it, and they obeyed him, Job. 21. He
commanded that fish that had swallowed a Stater to come to Peter's Angle to pay
his tribute, and that obeyed him; He commanded the Asse-colt whereon never man
sat to carry him with all gentleness to Jerusalem, as if it had been tamed by
former riding, and it obeyed him; He commanded diseases of all sorts to depart
from the sick, and they obeyed him: Yea he commanded the Devils to come out of
certain men and women, and they obeyed him; Yea at the time of Noabs flood, He
commanded all sorts of creatures, as well the wild ravenous kind, as the tame
kind, to come of their own accord into Noabs Ark, and to live quietly together,
and they obeyed him, Genesis 7. 89. But the wicked world, because they despised
the Spirit of Christ in Noab, therefore Christ commanded a deluge of water to
seize upon their bodies, and their souls he sent to the prison of Hell, I Pet.
319.

7 God gave the Mediator an absolute Dominion over all Tyrants, so that they
cannot do as much mischief to his people as they desire, For Christ rules even
in the midst of his enemies, Psalm. 110. 2, 5, 6, 7. Psalm. 29. 10, 11, 12. Prove.
8. 15, 16. And therefore the Father has commilled all judgment to his Son,
because all men should boner the Son, as they honor the Father, Joh. 5. 22, 23.
And has given him Authority to execute judgment because he is the Son of Man,
Joh. 5. 27. And if he had not been declared to be the Son of Man just upon
Adams Fall, the Devil would have made a hellish confusion of the Creation at
that instant, but he was prevented by the right Heir that stood ready to take
the Government of all upon him, as soon as ever Adam fell.

From these, and the like considerations it is evident, that God created the
world for the Honor of the Mediator, and that he might rule it as the right
Heir of it; And the Hebrew Doctors have a common saying agreeing with this,
That the world had not been created, but for the Messiab; And therefore hence
it follows, That God could not keep a perfect Rest on the seventh day, until
he had put all things in subjection under the feet of Christ, as the proper
Lord, and right Heir of all the Creation; and therefore Adam must fall, and
also be Re-created before the seventh day.

Conclusion.
God did perfect the whole Creation on the sixth day, by ordering all things
according to the Platform of his eternal Counsel and Providence.

1 By ordering the Devils Fall.

2 By ordering Adams Fall.

3 By ordaining a Mediator, and instating of him into his Priestly Office.

4 By creating a humane nature for the Mediator, of the seed of Eve.

5 By his Office of Mediation he purchased the Spirit of his Father for the
Re-creating of fallen Adam and Eve.

6

6 By this means they were made a part of Gods heavenly Host.

7 By this means they were made the chiefest part of Gods Host here on earth.

8 When all this was done, then Christ was Heir of all things.

9 When all this was done, then Satan's Head-plot was broken.

10 When all this was done, then, and not till then, God could keep a perfect
Rest on the seventh day from all his works, because by this means he had
finished that work that at first he had made but mutably perfect in the former
part of the sixth day: And therefore it follows by good consequence, That the
Sabbath was not ordained in the time of Adams Innocence, But after his Fall and
Re^creation by the Promised Seed.

CHAP. VII.
Proving that Gods rest on the soventh Day was such a perfect rest, that
nothing could happen afterward that could any whit lessen or disturb the
perfection of his rest on the Seventh Day, as it would have happened if God had
kept a sabbath of rest whiles Adam stood in a mutable condition.

The Text says in the latter clause of Genesis 2. 2. That God rested the Seventh
day from all his Works which he had made.

But God could not be said to keep a perfect rest from all his Works which he
had made, as long as Adam stood in a mutable condition, for God knew from
Eternity that Adam and Eve would presently fall from their Created perfections,
through the temptation of Satan, and that thereupon the whole Creation would
fall into utter confusion, and that then God must either suffer Satan to take
the Dominion of the whole Creation, or else that he must begin again to make it
more perfect than it was before, by a new Creation.

Seeing therefore that one of these two things must necessarily follow upon
Adams fall, God could not keep a perfect rest on the Seventh Day from all his
Works, until he had installed the Mediator into his Office, and settled the
whole government of all things upon his shoulders, as upon our mighty God and
Prince of peace, Es. 9. 6, 7.

If God had rested on the Seventh Day, before he had settled the whole Creation
upon the Mediator, then the Devil might have rejoiced more upon the first
seventh day than God.

1 Because the Devil had made frustrate the glory of God in Man's Creation.

2 Because he had spoiled the glory of Gods order in the residue of the
Creation.

But God could not suffer this, and therefore it follows, that God could not
keep a perfect rest as long as Adam stood in mutable condition; neither could
he keep a day of rest after Adams fall, until he had made Adam and Eve perfect
again by a Recreation, and until he had establised all the residue of the
Creation upon that sure Rock whose work is perfect, Deuteronomy. 32. 4. But as soon as
God had re-created fallen Adam and Eve, as the first fruits of his Holy
Militant Church here on earth, and of his Church Triumphant in Heaven; then,
and not till then, God rested on the seventh day from all his Work which he had
made, and then his rest was a most perfect rest, so that nothing was lacking to
the perfection thereof, and therefore nothing could happen afterward that
could any way lessen or disturb his rest, because he rested upon that sure
Mediator, who had Covenanted to break the Devils Head-plot by his propitiatory
Sacrifice, or Sacrifice of atonement for fallen Adam and Eve, and for all the
Elect to the end of the world.

CHAP. VIII.
Of the true nature of Gods rest on the Seventh Day.

First, It must be remembered, That Gods rest on the seventh day was not a
Natural rest, after the labor of his six Days Work; for the Creator of all the
ends of the earth faints not, neither is weary, Esa. 40. 28.

Secondly, Neither was Gods rest on the seventh day a bare cessation from
Creating any other sorts of Creatures, though some inconsiderate Professors
would have it to be no more, thinking thereby to warrant their Carnal ease, and
their careless keeping of the Lords Day; but such kind of rest as this is
Gods Soul does hate.

Thirdly, Neither was Gods rest upon the seventh day a bare contemplation of
his visible Creation, as others would have it, thinking thereby to warrant
their pleasant Re-creations, and Contemplations upon the Lords Day, by walking
out into the Fields to be hold the Works of God, and to behold his eternal
Power and God head in the Creation; this is not the true rest of the Sabbath,
for such duties as these a Heathen Philosopher may do upon the Sabbath Day, and
yet not observe the true rest of the Sabbath; but this sort of Persons are
misled by a false supposition, that the Sabbath was first ordained as a day of
rest in the time of Adams innocence for contemplation on the visible Creation
only.

Fourthly, The true nature of Gods rest on the seventh day That the true nature
of Gods rest on the seventh day was his sweet content in the Medi^tor.
was his sweet content in the Mediator, because he had made all his Creation
perfect in the Mediator, and because he had established Adams happiness upon
the promised Seed, as upon a sure Rock, and firm Foundation, and because he had
put all the rest of the Creation under his feet.

As soon as God had thus renewed the face of the earth, Psalm. 104. 30. and
settled the government of all his Works upon the Person and Office of the
Mediator, then God rested on the seventh day, with infinite content, and sweet
satisfaction, rejoicing in the Works of his hands, Psalm. 104. 31. but the
thirtieth verse makes Gods Creation to be Spiritual as well as earthly, and so
does Psalm. 100. 3. Psalm. 102. 18. Es. 54. 5. Es. 65. 18.

This sweet satisfying rest which God took in settling all the works of his
hands upon the Mediator, is thus expressed by Moses, In six days Jehovah made
the Heavens and the Earth, and in the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed,
Exodus 31. 17. Gods resting was not from his weariness of labor in the work of
Creation, but from the heavy burden of Adams sin, which had spoiled all his
Creation till he had re-created Adam, and settled him and all the rest of the
Creation upon the Rock Christ, and in this respect God does often complain of
Man's sin as a heavy burden to his Soul, Amos 5. 2, 13, Es. 1. 14. And as the
sin of the old, World did grieve God to the heart, Genesis 6. 6. so no doubt but
Adams sin above any other sin did grieve him to his heart, until God had
re-created Adam and Eve by the promised Seed, and put the whole Creation under
his government, and then God rested the seventh day, and was refreshed; that is
to say, the grief of his heart which fell upon him in the sixth day by reason
of Adams sin, was removed from him, by the Mediators undertaking to make a
reconciliation by his propitiatory Sacrifice of Atonement in the cool of the
sixth day, and from that day forwards God instructed Adam how to offer
Sacrifices of Atonement as a lively memorial thereof; and thenceforth all
Sacrifices of Atonement are called sacrifices of rest to Jehovah, and sweet
sacrifices of rest, Genesis 8. 21. because Christ's Sacrifice does quiet and
pacify Gods Soul, that was so exceedingly displeased and grieved for Adams
sin, and therefore the Seventy call sacrifices of rest sweet Sacrifices, which
phrase of theirs Paul does approve and use, Ephesians. 5. 2. they are also called
sacrifices of Atonement, or propitiatory Sacrifices.

Upon this new settlement of the Creation upon the Mediator, All the Trinity
rested, and were refreshed on the seventh day, because they had perfected man's
happiness by a Re-creation.
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost were refreshed; now all
the blessed Trinity, our blessed Creators and Makers, did rejoice in the works
of their hands.

1 The Father was refreshed with great joy of heart, because he had found out a
Reconciler, and because his lost Son was found again, Luke 15.

2 The Son rejoiced, and was refreshed, because he had taken upon him the
Person and Office of a Mediator, that so he might seek and save that which was
lost, Matthew. 18. 11, 12, 13, 14.

3 The Holy Ghost rejoiced, and was refreshed, because he had re-created the
heart of Adam and Eve, and filled their Souls with joy unspeakable, and
glorious, by inabling them to believe in the promised Seed, as the Procurator
of the Fathers Atonement by his propitiatory sacrifice.

And truly this work of Re-creation must needs be a ground of perfect rest, and
of joyful refreshing to such blessed Creators, that could tell how to find out
such a mysterious way to create anew that glorious work, that was so
confounded and spoiled by Satan's Head-plot.

The Angels also rejoiced at the conversion of Adam and Eve, saying, Glory to
God in the highest, and on the earth peace, and good will toward men, Luke 2.
14. and this must needs be so, because they rejoice at the conversion of every
sinner that repents, Luke 15. 7.

Adam and Eve did also keep a blessed rest upon the Sabbath; for their Souls
were rejoiced and refreshed, because they did by faith rest on the Seed of the
Woman for the breaking of the Devils Head-plot.

And thus the first seventh day was a joyful day of rest, and refreshing, both
to all the Trinity, to all the Elect Angels, and to repenting Adam and Eve; and
so it is to all true repenting, and believing sinners. Amen.

And it is further evident that Gods rest on the seventh day, was nothing else
but the quieting of his mind in Christ's Sacrifice of Atonement, because God is
said to rest in several types of Christ as well as in the seventh day, in
relation to his resting on the Mediator for man's Redemption from Satan's
Headplot.

1 The Land of Canaan is called Gods Rest, Exodus 33. 14. Psalm. 95. 11. Heb. 4.
1. because God had appointed that Land to be the resting place of his
Tabernacle, and Temple, Jos. 22. 19. 2 Samuel 7. which did typifie the humane
nature of Christ, Joh. 2. 19. Heb. 8. 2. Heb. 11. where his Sacrifices of Rest
might only be offered.

2 The Tabernacle is called Gods Rest, Psalm. 132. 8.

3 Zion is called Gods Rest, Psalm. 132. 13, 14.

4 The Temple is called Gods Rest, 2 Chronicles. 6. 41. and the house of his Rest
for the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, 1 Chronicles. 28. 2.

5 All Sacrifices of Atonement are called Sacrifices of Rest, because they
have a sweet savor that gives rest to the disquieted senses, Genesis 8. 21. Exodus
29. 18. Number. 15. 3. Ez. 20. 14.

But no man, I think, will say, that God did rest in any of these things
otherwise than as they were types of the Mediators Person and Sacrifice,
wherein only Gods soul does rest as in the only Mediatorial procuring cause
of his Atonement for man's Redemption from Satan's Head-plot.

The Tabernacle wherein God did dwell among the Son^ of Israel was three times
over most carefully described by Moses. 1 In Exodus 25. 2 In Exodus 36. 3 In
Exodus 39. 32 to 43. This threefold telling of the Tabernacle, which God did
after cast off, says one of the Hebrew Doctors, was not to show, that God did
so highly rest in it for it self, but to show that he only rested in the
Tabernacle of the Messiah; and because the blessed Martyr Stephen knew that the
High Sanedrim did rest after an outward hypocritical manner in the Temple, he
did upbraid their foolish confidence, saying, The most High dwells not (or
rests not) in Temples made with hands, Act 7. 48. implying, that the most
High did only rest in Christ that was typified by the Temple.

So then the place of Gods rest, and of fallen man's rest, lies only in the
work of Reconciliation by the Mediators Sacrifice of Atonement.

Conclusion.
From all the Premises I conclude, That Gods rest on the seventh day, was his
satisfying delight, and his sweet content in Christ, because he was ordained to
be the Seed of the Woman to break the Devils Head-plot by his Propitiatory
Sacrifice of Atonement, and because God had settled the whole Creation upon the
Mediator, whose work was so perfect that nothing was lacking to the perfection
thereof; And therefore it follows, that God ordained the Sabbath, not in the
time of Adams Innocence, but after his Fall and Re-creation.

CHAP. IX.
Proving, that God blessed the first seventh day with many Spiritual
Ordinances, such as were apt to convey Spiritual, and Eternal blessedness to
fallen man.

THis sentence, God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it, Genesis 2. 3. does
contain in it a full description how God did bless the seventh day for the
good of fallen man.

1 I will speak of the word Blessed in this Chapter.

2 I will speak of the word Sanctified in the next Chapter.

1 It is meet to inquire how God did bless the first seventh* day; Did he
bless it with any natural blessing above the other six days? Has he bestowed
a greater blessing of fairer Weather, or the like, upon that daymore than upon
any other day in the week? no, but on the contrary he restrained his Manna from
falling on that day, and bestowed it upon the Jews on all the other six days
of the week.

Therefore the blessing wherewith God did bless the seventh day was not a
common natural blessing* but doubtless it was a spiritual blessing in relation
to the good of fallen man. Hence then we may conclude, that God did bl^sse that
day with diverse spiritual Ordinances, ^uch as tended to make fallen man blessed,
by opening the manner how the Seed of the Woman should break Satan's Head-plot
for man's R^demption.

Adam in his Innocence had no need of any such spiritual God would never have
blessed the seventh day with spiritual Ordinances, so as he did, if the
Mediator had not been declared to fallen Adam before the 7 day.
Ordinances as God did bl^sse ^he seventh day withal; neither could Adam in
his Innocence sanctify one day more perfectly than another, for by nature he
was pure without imperf^ction.

I^ there had been no other Argument in all the Scripture to prove that Adam
fell, and was Re-created on the sixth day by the Promised Seed, This sentence,
He blessed and sanctified the seventh day, had been sufficience to prove it;
for God would never have blessed the seventh day with such spiritual Ordinances
as he did, nor yet have sanctified that day for the time of his spiritual
Ordinances, if the Mediator had not been declared to fallen Adam before the
seventh day.

And this is further proved by some other Scriptures.

1 God does command us fallen men in the fourth Commandment to remember the
Sabbath day to sanctify it (and the reason is added) because in it he rested
from all the works that he had made: And (for that reason) J^hovah did bless
the seventh day, and sanctify it, Exodus 20. 8, 9, 10, 11.

2 The Prophet Isaiah says, That God did bless the Sabbath day (namely for
the good of fallen man) For (says he) Blessed is the man that keeps the
Sabbath, and polluteth i^ nol, Es. 56. 2.

3 Our Savior does t^llus, that the Sabbath was made for man, Mar. 2. 27.
namely for the good of man in misery; but Adam in God did not leave Adam and
Eve to spend the seventh day in private speculations, but he blessed the first
7 day with variety of Ordinances both for public and private use, for their
best spiritual good*
his Innocence was not in misery, therefore the Sabbath was not then made; but
as soon as he had ^aten of the forbidden fruit he was in misery, for then his
soul was dead in sin, and his body full of corruption, and then the Sabbath was
made for man. Hence it follows by necessary consequence, that God did not
bless the seventh day in Adams Innocence, but after his Fall and Recreation.

2 God did not leave Adam to himself after his Fall and Recreation, to spend
the seventh day in his own private meditations as he thought best, but God
blessed the seventh day with several public Ordinances for the good of fallen
Adam, and instructed him in the right use of those Ordinances; if God had left
Adam to spend ^he Sabbath in his own private speculations as he thought best
doubtless his Religion would soon have been no better than a S^maritan
Religion, for Adam by his fall was become so corrupt in his affections, and so
blind in his understanding of Gods will, that he would not, nor could not have
spent the Sabbath to his spiritual good.

It is a dangerous thing therefore to prefer a man's own private meditations,
and speculations, to public Ordinances upon the Sabbath; God would not leave
Adam to such a liberty to do as he thought best, such a liberty will soon open
a wide gap to Satan's delusions: But God blessed the seventh day with his own
public Ordinances, not excluding private meditations; God blessed the seventh
day both with public and private Ordinances; for public Ordinances are not so
much blessed as when they are attended with private preparation before, with
reverent attention at, and with careful rumination and application afterward*
If there be not this care added to the public Ordinances, the Devil will soon
steal away the seed that is sown, out of our hearts and souls.

Now the manner how God was pleased to instruct Adam and Eve in the exercise of
his public Ordinances, was by the lively Oracles of the Mediator, and
therefore doubtless as he was promised to be the Seed of the woman, so he
appeared to Adam in his humane shape, as he did to Jacob, Genesis 32. 24. And in
this regard, he is called, The word of the Father, even from the beginning,
Joh. 1. 1, 2. And the Father gave him a Commandment what to say, Joh. 12. 49,
50. And he it was that did instruct all the Fathers; And therefore Stephen
says, That he the God of glory appeared to Abraham in Ur of the ^aldes, Act.
7. 2. and his apparition to Abraham was in such a familiar manner, that it did
work in him an inward regard and attention to his words, whereby his soul was
convinced and converted. In some such manner did he appear to Adam and Eve when
he did instruct them in the knowledge of his Person and Office, and of the use
of his public Ordinances wherewith he was pleased to bless the seventh day.

Now the several Ordinances wherewith God was pleased to bless the seventh
day, I will distinguish into two sorts, or ranks.

1 Into such Ordinances as were plain and manifest.

2 Into such as were Typical and Mystical.

1 I will speak of the plain and manifest Ordinances; These were often used
without the typical, but the typical could not well be used without some of
these were added thereto; By these plain and manifest Ordinances God appointed
Adam as a Prophet, by the exercise of them, to instruct himself, his wife, and
posterity, by opening the misery of his fall, and the remedy by the Promised
Seed.

1 The first sort of these manifest Ordinances, was in preaching and proclaming
his own miserable condition by his disobedience God commanded Adam to preach
every seventh day either upon his miserable fall, or else upon the riche^ of
Gods grace, for his recovery by the Promised Seed.
in eating of the forbidden fruit; how he had lost Gods Image by Gods just hand
of punishment, and how he was corrupted in all the parts and powers of his soul
and body by the poysonful counsel that Satan breathed into Eves soul.

2 Adam must preach, open, and declare to himself, and his wife (till they were
increased in number) the riches of Gods grace for his recovery by the Seed of
the Woman, which God had ordained to break the Devils Head-plot for their
Redemption; and in opening this, he could not choose but open and declare the
personal union of both the natures of the Mediator, and the excellent dignity
of his Office.

This blessed Doctrine Adam was commanded to study to explain and enlarge
(every seventh day) in all the branches thereof, and in all the several
benefits thereof to fallen man, according to the full extent of Gods Declaration
in Genesis 3. 15. and therefore he must open and explain how Christ should be the
Seed of the Woman, and how he should break the Devils Head-plot by his Priestly
Office, and by his Propitiatory Sacrifice of Atonement, at the very sametime
when the Devil should endeavor to prevent it, by putting him to death, and by
peircing his foot-soals as a sinful Malefactor upon the Cross; and how he
being God as well as man, should destroy through death him that had the power
of death, that is the Devil, and how he should by that death (which he
performed as a Mediatorial Sacrifice) reconcile God to fallen man, and so procure
the Fathers Justification from the sentence of Condemnation, and his favor for
their adoption, and for their enjoying of his heavenly inheritance.

These and such like points as these, God instructed Adam to study and to
preach to himself, wife, and posterity, in season and out of season, but
especially upon every seventh day. God commanded Adam to join the duty of
Prayer to the duty of Preaching.


3 To this necessary duty of preaching, whereby God does speak unto sinners,
Adam was commanded to join the necessary duty of Prayer and supplication,
whereby sinners do speak unto God, and he must branch out this duty of Prayer
into all the several parts of it; as,

1 Into Confession of his miserable condition by his sin and disobedience, and
of the sinful corruption of our nature, together with our daily actual
rebellions, for the deeper abasing of our natural Pride, and self-conceited
righteousness.

2 Into Petition for several graces of Sanctification, but especially for the
inward testimonyof our Reconciliation and Adoption.

3 Deprecation of evil, according to that Petition, Lead us not into temptation.

4 Thanksgiving for all favors received, but especially for those Spiritual
favors by the promised seed.

5 Singing of Psalms also must be added (sometimes at least) as an act of
Spiritual joy for Gods manifold favors, but especially for that Grand Mercy of
our Reconciliation, procured by the Mediators propitiatory sacrifice of
atonement; for by that means the Devils Head-plot is broken, and fallen Man
redeemed, and set free from the power of Satan.

These several sorts of Ordinances I call by the name of plain and manifest
Ordinances, because they often were and might be used without any addition of
Typical sacrifices, or ceremonies of cleaness.

And this is evident by Gods Command afterward to the Sea my Discourse
touching the Jews Synagogues order on this text.
Church of Israel, in Lev. 23. 3. The seventh day shall be a Sabbath of
Sabbatism, a Convocation of Holiness; it shall be a Sabbath to Jehovah in all
your dwellings.

This sentence [in All your dwellings] proves that God commanded them to
observe the Sabbath, not only at the Tabernacle where Sacrifices must be only
offered, but it must be kept in all their dwellings where no Sacrifices might
be offered, and yet by dwellings we must not understand every man's private
Tent, for God commands a Convocation of Holiness, and a Convocation agrees not
to every man's private Tent; therefore the meaning of these words, A Convocation
in all your dwellings means a Convocation of Holiness in all their several
Synagogues, which were to be conveniently placed in or among all their
dwellings, both during the time of their abode in the Wilderness, and also
wherever they dwelt afterward.

This commanded convocation was not given to the Jews in regard of their
Festival Sabbaths, which were observed with the solemnity of Sacrifices, and
other rites of Holiness, for their Festival Sabbaths were commanded to be
observed only in the Land of Canaan, at the particular place that God should
choose to place his Tabernacle or Temple in, after they should be settled in rest
therein; and indeed they could not observe their festival Sabbaths in the
Wilderness, neither could they every seventh day offer Sacrifices in the
Wilderness, for during the time of their travels in the Wilderness the Holy
things were folded up.

But yet notwithstanding their travels in the Wilderness, they were commanded
to observe every seventh day wi^h a convocation of holiness, in or among all
their dwellings, namely in their several Synagogues, which must be placed for
their best convenience in or among all their dwellings.

And it is evident, that the Jews did observe the Sabbath with Holy
convocations in all their Synagogues, because our Savior did usually preach
every seventh day in their Synagogues, either in Galile, or in Judea, where
none of Aarons Ceremonies had any use at all.

By this command of God to the Jews, it is manifest, That God commanded Adam to
observe every seventh day with his plain and manifest Ordinances, and
doubtless oftentimes also with his Typiral and Mystical Ordinances, which at
the first were not tied to one special place.

2 The second sort of Gods public Ordinances were Typical, and Mystical, the
chiefest of all this kind of Worship was by propitiatory Sacrifices, or
Sacrifices of Atonement, which were of several sorts.

1 Burnt-offerings, Levit. 1. 2 Peace Offerings, Levit. 3. 3 Sin Offerings,
Levit. 4. 3. 4 Trespasse-offerings, Levit. 5. 6.
All these several sorts of Sacrifices did typifie and represent the Mediators
Propitiatory Sacrifice of Atonement, by which he procured the Fathers
Atonement for fallen man's Reconciliation, Justification, and Adoption, and so
consequently for man's Redemption from Satan's Head-plot.

This blessed Doctrine of Salvation, Christ represented to Adams faith in the
very first seventh day, by causing Adam as a Priest to sacrifice some Lamb, or
some such like beast, and then doubtless he said unto him, Behold the Lamb of
God that takes away the sin of the world, Joh. 1. 29. for Christ was typically
slain from the beginning of the world, Rev. 8. 13.

Adam of himself could not tell how to offer sacrifice, and Christ Jesus taught
Adam by the Sacrifice of a Lamb how he should be the Lamb of God to take away
the sin of the world.
therefore doubtless Jesus Christ appeared to him in the shape of his humane
nature, and did instruct him by a lively Oracle, what the Office of a Priest
was, and how to build an Altar of earth (for that kind of Altar was first in
use, Exodus 20 24.) and that all those places where such Altars were builded,
were holy places, as long as such places were in use for sacrifice, and
therefore Christ Jesus did usually sanctify such places, either by his
glorious apparition, or by fire from heaven to*consume the Sacrifice, or by
both.

The Altar was holy in another respect, namely because it was ordained to be a
type of the Godhead of Christ, whereon he would one day offer his humane
nature, as a sacrifice of Atonement, Exodus 29. 37. Mat. 23. 19. Heb. 9. 14.

And doubtless Christ Jesus did kindle Adams sacrifice at first with fire from
heaven, for he did usually kindle the sacrifices of the Fathers with fire from
Heaven, as a sign and token to them, that his death was a propitiatory
sacrifice of Atonement, and that their persons were thereby received into full
favor, Lev. 9. 23. Judge. 13. 19, 20, 23. 1 King. 18. 38, 39. 2 Chronicles. 7. 1, 2,
3. Psalm. 20. 3.

And doubtless Christ Jesus told Adam that this fire from heaven did represent
his Eternal Spirit, by which his humane nature should one day be offered up
unto God without spot, as a propitiatory sacrifice for his eternal Redemption,
Heb. 9. 14.

But after wards when Cain came to offer his sacrifice upon the same Altar,
Christ Jesus did not kindle his sacrifice from heaven as he kindled Adams and
Abels sacrifice; and by that Cain knew that God did not accept his person, as
he did his brother Abel, and thereupon he hated his brother Abel* because his
works were good, and his own evil, for Cain wanted says in the Seed of the
woman, which was promised to break the Devils Head-plot by his propitiatory
sacrifice, which was taught, and typified by sacrifices: This mystery God kept
secret in types from such as wanted faith, even from the beginning of the
world, Romans 16. 25. and therefore it was kept secret from the Heathen Nations:
But in the fullness of time Christ Jesus sent his Apostles to publish the
unsearchable riches of this mystery, which from the beginning of the world has
been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ, Ephesians. 3. 8 9. Col. 1.
26. Col. 2. 3.

3 God instructed Adam in sundry other kinds of Ceremonial types that tended to
sanctification, before he came to present his person and sacrifice before the
Lord. As for example, Christ Jesus taught him, 1 How to purify his person by
washing his body, and his garments, in clean water, just like as he taught
Moses afterward, Exodus 3. 5. Exodus 19. 10. or else by changing his foul
garments for fair, as Jacob being first taught, did also teach his hous-hold to
do, when he went into Gods presence to worship, Genesis 35. 2.

2 God instructed Adam how to put a difference between beasts for sacrifice,
how he should refuse the unclean, and offer the clean, just as he instructed
Noah before he entered into the Ark, Genesis 7. 2.

It is absurd to think that God did bless the first Sabbath with differing
Ordinances from those in Moses, or that God did instruct Adam to worship him in
a differing way from that which he did after establish by Moses and the
Prophets. Doubtless therefore when God instructed Adam after what manner he
must offer sacrifices of Atonement, he also instructed him how to understand,
and how to open the plain meaning of all, and how he should preach it to
others, and how to pray either by way of confession of his sinfulness, or
petition for some special grace, or thanksgiving, or singing of Psalms, as he
did after instruct and appoint by Moses and the Prophets.

1 When God appointed sacrifices of Atonement, he appointed to join preaching
therewith (sometimes at least) and therefore he appointed the Levites to join
pr^aching to their sacrifices, for they are commanded to teach his judgments
unto Jacob, and his Law unto Israel, Deuteronomy. 33. 10. Lev. 10. 11. Mal. 2. 6. 7.

2 When they offered Burnt-offerings, Christ Jesus taught them to make Petition
and Supplication to the Lord for his favor in Christ, 1 Samuel 13. 12. Job 42.
8. Ezra 6 9, 10. and doubtless Job 42. 8.
Christ Jesus taught Adam to do so; for this kind of sacrifice was chiefest,
and it was first in use, even from the beginning of the world; for Noah did
offer his Burnt-offering, Genesis 8. 20. and Christ Jesus did appoint it as the
first and chief sacrifice in Moses, Genesis 8. 20.
Lev. 1. 2

3 When they offered Sin Offerings, or Trespass-offerings, they mustlay both
their hands with all their might upon the head of their sacrifice; and confess
their sin to God over the head of their Sin-offering, and their trespasses to
God over the head of their Trepass Offering. But why must they impose both
their hands with all their might upon the head of these Sacrifices? The Answer
is, because by this Imposition, they were taught and instructed to rest and
repose their souls by a strong faith upon the propitiatory Sacrifice of Christ,
for the full Atonement of all their sins and trespasses of which they made
confession, as I have See the meritorious price of man's Redemption on Lev. 4.
opened the point more at large in the Meritorious price of man's Redemption on
Lev. 4. And touching the point of Confession, the Hebrew Doctors have a
sentence that is worthy of due observation, they say, That without particular
confession of their known sins, no Atonement is made for them by their
Sin Offerings, or by their Trespass-offerings. And this is just according to
the rule in Prove. 28. 13. He that hides his Prove. 28. 13.
sin shall not prosper, but be that confesses and for saketh them shall find
mercy; and no question but Jesus Christ taught Adam thus to* do when he offered
his sin, or his Trespass-offerings.

4 When they offered Peace Offerings, they imposed their hands on the head of
their Peace Offerings; And secondly, then they made confession of their peace,
but especially they blessed God for their peace with God in breaking the devils
Head*plot by the Seed of the Woman, Lev. 3.

With these, and such like spiritual Ordinances God did bless the first
seventh day. And these blessed Ordinances could not choose but fill the souls of
Adam and Eve, with joy unspeakable and glorious, causing them to break out into
songs of praise, as Zachary did, Luke 1. 68. saying (in effect as he did)
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people,
and has raised up a horn of salvation for us, etc. as he spoke by the mouth of
all his holy Prophets ever since the world began, Luke 1. 69. In these words
Luke 1 69, 70. Act. 3* 21.
Zachary does affirm these two things; First, That there have been holy
Prophets ever since the world began, and therefore Adam was a Prophet.
Secondly, That all the Prophets* even from the beginning of the world, have
spoken and rejoiced in this Horn of salvation, therefore Adam did speak with
joy of heart of this Horn of salvation* and made many Psalms of praise for the
Seed of the Woman that should break the Serpents head for his Redemption.

And doubtless God made these Ordinances to be a rich blessing to the souls of
Adam and Eve, for by them they were more fully instructed and confirmed in
their blessed condition by the Promised Seed.

And God is pleased still to bless his people all the world over by his plain
and manifest Ordinances, as the Conduit-pipes of his spiritual blessings in
Christ Jesus, Epb. 1. 3. for by these Ordinances it is published to the world
that Christ is the Seed of the Woman, in whom all Nations of the earth are
blessed, Genesis 12. 3* Act. 3 26. Gal. 3. 14.

O^ject. But here it may be objected, That in likelihood, God did not ordain
any public Ordinances in the first seventh day, nor in many other Sabbaths
after, because for a long time there was no competent number of persons, to
make a public meeting; and after that Adam and Eve had children, yet for many
years they could not be able to understand the use and benefit of Ordinances;
and Ordinances cannot be called Public, where there is no more but two persons
to meet together; two persons cannot be called a public Church-Ass^mbly. Two
persons where no more can be had, may be called a true Church of Christ, and
may exercise Gods Ordinance, after a public manner* Rev. 11 3.


Answ. Two persons, where no more can be had, may be called a true Church of
Christ, and may exercise Gods Ordinances in a true public manner, for the
Church of Christ under the persecutions of Antichrist is called by the name of
Two Witnesses, Rev. 11. 3. though the Church of Christ were many thousands in
those times, yet it is called by the name of Two Witnesses, because by Moses
Law two Witnesses were accounted sufficient to confirm any truth, Deuteronomy. 17.
Hence I infer, that if no more but two can be had to testify the truth against
An^ichrist, they are to be esteemed as a true Church of Christ, and therefore
they may be called a true Church of Christ as well as two thousand* and our
Savior says, That where two or three are gathered together in his name, there
he will be present in the midst of them. Matthew. 18. Mat. 18. 19, 20*
19, 20.

Simeon and Levy made a Church when they agreed together to Genesis 49. 6*
destroy the Sichemites, for Jacob says of them thus, My glory, be thou not
joined with their (Kahal, that is to say with their*) Church, Genesis 49. 6. Their
Church, I grant, was a Church of evil doers, but yet they were a sufficient
number to make a Church (though at this time overcome with the temptation of
revenge) then why might not Re-created Adam and Eve make a Church of Christ
much more, and so consequently enjoy Gods Ordinances as public Ordinances,
seeing God did bless the seventh day with Ordinances, and sanctify it, that
is to say, God did command them to sanctify it by the use of the said
ordinances?

I conclude therefore, that Christ Jesus did command Adam and Eve, to exercise
those Ordinances (wherewith he was pleased to bless the Sabbath) as a Church
of Christ, and from thenceforth he has and will continue his Church upon the
face of the earth to the worlds end, though it may, and has oftentimes been
brought to a very small number, as it was at the Flood, and at the building of
Babel, and in the days of Abraham, when God called him to come away from his
Country, and from his Idolatrous kindred, Genesis 12. and in the days of Job, and
in the days of Enosh, for after Seth had lived a hundred and five years, which
was G^n. 4. 2^*
two hundred thirty five years from the Creation of Adam* then many of Adams
children did not abide in the Truth, they did not regard the Sabbath, nor the
Sabbath Ordinances, but they regarded the Daughters of Cain more than the
children of God, and took them wifes of all that they liked. And then grew
profaneness instead of calling upon the name of Lord, Genesis 4. 26. Godly Seth
for very grief of this profane generation called his son Enosh, that is to say
Sorrowful. So Tremelius in his Elder Editions does read the text (though Junius
has since altered him to a clean contrary sense) and so does Mr. Broughton
read it, and all the Hebrew Doctors in general, and Mr. Ainsworth comes near
them.

But if the children of the Church had but continued to regard the holy
Sabbath, and the Ordinances thereof, as they did in The disregarding of the
Sabbath, and the Ordinances thereof, is the high way to all profaneness and
Apostasy.
Adams first days before A^el was killed for Religion, they could not have
fallen into so deep an Apostasy as they did in the days of Enoch; for if men
will but reverently attend unto the exercise of those spiritual Ordinances
wherewith God did first bless the seventh day, they should doubtless be made
partakers of the spiritual blessing that Christ Jesus has annexed thereto; for
the good Shepherd Christ Jesus has promised to all his Sheep that will be
guided and governned by his Ordinances, That he will make them, and the places
round about his Hill, and to be a blessing, and that there shall be showers of
blessing upon them, Ezekiel. 34. 26. and so the Prophet Isaiah Ezekiel. 34. 26.
testifies, saying, Blessed is the man that keeps the Sabbath, and p^luteth
it not, and that takes hold of my Covenant (as Adam did when he believed that
the Seed of the Woman should break the Serpents head) them will I bring to my
holy Mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their
Burnt-offerings, and their Sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine Altar, Es.
56. 2, 6, 7. Hence it is manifest, that those that regard the Sabbath, and the
Sabbath Ordinances, shall be blessed with spiritual blessings in heavenly
things; And if God bless, who shall curse? for his blessing makes rich, Prove.
10. 22. it makes them rich with temporal blessings that diligently attend upon
their Civil employments, and so it also makes them rich with spiritual
blessings that diligently attend upon Gods Sabbath Ordinances; Gods blessing
did increase the Widows oil, and the five loaves, and two fishes; and therefore
his blessing is called Multiplication, Genesis 1. 22. and sometimes it is called A
rich reward* 2 King. 5. 15. and sometimes it is called ( Gods) Liberality,
Prove. 11. 25. compared with 2 Cor. 9. 5. Yea Gods blessing is so plentiful,
and so powerful upon his Sabbath Ordinances, that he is said to Command his
blessing upon Sion, and life for evermore, Psalm. 133. therefore his blessing
wherewith he blessed the first seventh day must needs be mighty in operation,
even to the Re-creation and Conversion of many ten thousand souls, Heb. 4* 12.
Luke 11. 28. and therefore David does by way of Exclamation cry out, O blessed
are they that dwell in thy house, Psalm. 84* 4. namely they are thus blessed
that do as it were dwell there by their frequent and constant resort to his
Ordinances, for his Ordinances are apt to convey blessings to the diligent
soul. And therefore Paul told the Romans, that when he should come unto them*
He should come with abundance of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ, Romans 15.
29. The Apostle made account that the preaching of the Gospel would in rich
them with abundance of spiritual blessings* and this blessing does arise from
Gods blessing of the first seventh day with Sabbath-Ordinances.

And therefore as soon as Christ Jesus had given order about his
Sabbath-Worship at Mount Sinai, and had in special commanded them to observe
the seventh day, by a holy convocation in or among all their dwellings (namely
in their Synagogues* as I have before expounded it) then he made a gracious
promise to his people, saying, In all places where I shall record my name, I
will come unto thee, and bless thee, Exodus 20. 24. and in this respect Christ
Jesus did appoint the Priests in the Sanctuary, and Zeliach Tzibbur in the
several Synagogues to pronounce a gracious blessing upon the assembly (that had
attended Gods Ordinances) at their departure, Numb* 6. 24. and to this blessing
the Lord was also pleased to add a gracious promise, in verse. 27. saying* They
shall put my name upon the Sons of Israel, and I will bless Numb. 6. 24* 27*
them; and this blessing is often remembered and repeated, as an encouragement
to all the godly to attend his Sabbath-Ordinances, Psalm. 115. 13. Psalm. 134. 3.
Psalm. 147. 13.

Object. You seem to apply Gods blessing to his Sabbath-Ordinan^es only, but
experience does tell us, that God does often bless the preaching of the Word
upon the Weekdays, to the conversion of many souls.

Ans. I answer, It is most true, that God does often bless the preaching of
his Word on the Weekdays* as well as upon the Sabbath days, to the conversion
of many thousand Souls; but that lets not, but that preaching must still be
accounted as one of his Sabbath-Ordinances, because God did first appoint it
for the Sabbath day, and it is now but borrowed to the Weekdays by the good
hand of God upon men's Spirits, as a furtherance to faith and holiness.

And I believe there are many thousand Souls that will readily witness to the
truth of this Doctrine, who by Gods blessing on the Word preached on the
Weekdays, have been turned from Darkness to Light, and from the power of
Satan to God; and such persons doubtless will with Nehemiah account the
Sabbath Day among the number of those special blessings that God bestowed* upon
his people, as a sign of his special grace in Christ, Nehem. 9. 13, 14.

Hitherto I have spoken of Gods blessing the seventh day with public
Ordinances; now I shall speak something of private Ordinances, wherewith God
has also blessed the seventh day.

Gods blessing of the Sabbath, is his blessing at large, even his Private
duties are commanded on the Sabbath days, as necessary handmaids to the
public.
blessing upon the whole day, he blessed the seventh day with as large a
blessing as may be, namely, not only with public, but also with private
Ordinances, and therefore he sanctified the whole day to his service, he did
not sanctify that part only wherein his public Ordinances were dispensed,
but the whole day, and therefore the whole day must be set apart to his
service; and therefore when the public Ordinances are ended, private duties
must take place, that the whole day may be blessed to our souls, and sanctified
to the Lords service.

Let no man therefore mistake me, for though I do not make private duties to be
commanded in the first place, yet I believe that private duties are commanded,
and blessed of God, as necessary handmaids to the public, and there are good
reasons for it.

1 Our barren hearts, our stony hearts, our thorny hearts, will not suffer the
blessed seed of the Word the take root, and to thrive there, unless we do
prepare them like to well-manured ground.

2 In hearing, Christ gives this caution, * Take heed how you hear; and the
Hebrew Doctors say, When any go to hear the Law read See Ains. in De^t. 31. 11.
or expounded, they must prepare their hearts, and make their ears attentive to
hear with fear and reverence, and with joy and trembling, as in the day when
the Law was given on Mount Sinai; though they were great wise men, which knew
the whole Law every whit, they were bound to hear with great attentiveness,
and so God required a careful preparation of his people at the hearing of the
Law, Ex. 19.

3 After hearing, our Savior does exhort his hearers saying, Take heed what
you hear, Mar. 4. 24. Mar. 8. 15. and in this respect, the men of Berea are
commended by the Holy Ghost, because they seached whether those things which
Paul preached were so or no, Act. 17. 11. And of four sorts of hearers our
Savior makes but one good, Mat. 13. And Christ Jesus does exhort us by Moses,
saying, Toese words which I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart, and
thou shall whet them upon thy children and shall speak of them when thou
fittest in thy house, and when thou walk by the way, and when thon lie
down, and when thou risest up, Deu. 6. 6, 7. Now if God required such diligence
as this every day, then much more upon the Sabbath day, and especially after
the public Ordinances are ended. And all this did Adam well understand, when
God is said to bless and sanctify the seventh day, as I shall further show on
the word Sanctify in the next Chapter.

CHAP. X.
Showing how God did Sanctify the seventh day.

1 GOD did not sanctify the seventh day, by putting any inherent sanctity into
that day more than into the other six days of the week, for God does not put
inherent sanctity into any earthly creature, but into the Elect number only, 1
Pet. 1. 12.

2 How then did God sanctify the seventh day?

Answ. In a twofold respect.

1 As the separated time of his public and private worship.

2 As a sanctified sign of Rest in the Seed of the Woman for the breaking of
the Devils Head-plot.

1 God did sanctify the seventh day for the separated time of his public
worship; and in this sense the word Sanctified does imply a double command of
God to fallen man.

1 It implies that God commanded Adam to set apart the seventh day from all
worldly uses, and to attend upon those spiritual Ordinances wherewith he had
blessed the seventh day.

2 It implies that God commanded fallen Adam to prepare his soul and body, to
come with all due care and reverence into the presence of God, to be partakers
of his Sabbath-Ordinances.

1 I will speak of the word Sanctify, as it implies the command of God to Adam
to set apart the seventh day from all worldly uses, and to attend upon those
spiritual Ordinances wherewith God had blessed the seventh day. And this is
evident,

1 Because God did never sanctify any thing for the use of fallen man, but he
did thereby command fallen man to sanctify When God did sanctify any thing
for man, he did by that act command man to s^nctifie that thing, by separating
it to the Lords use. Number. 8. 17.
it to the Lords use: As for example, when God did sanctify any persons to his
service, he did by that act command man to sanctify such persons to the Lord:
Every firstborn of the Sons of Israel (says the Lord) are mine, both of Man
and Beast; for in the day that I smote every firstborn in the Land of Egypt I
sanctified them unto me, Numb. 8. 17. that is, I commanded my people to
sanctify them to my service, which they did perform; First, By setting apart
some of the clean kind for Sacrifice; And secondly, by redeeming the rest with
money, which money God commanded to be employed to his service, either by
buying some Sacrifices of Atonement therewith for the public, or else it must
be for the repairing of Gods Sanctuary, as Exodus 13. does explain it.

2 When God did sanctify the Temple for the public place of his Typical
worship, 2 Chr. 7. 16. 2 Chr. 30. 8. he did thereby command man to sanctify
it, by performing every particular just as he commanded. Solomon might not
build the Temple after the fashion that he thought best, but he must do it in
all particulars as God commanded, 1 King. 9. 3. God did not leave any
sanctified thing that did any way appertain either to the service of the
Tabernacle, or of the Temple, neither to Moses discretion, nor to Solomon's
wisdom, but when God sanctified these places for his worship, he commanded
how, and after what manner Heb. 9. 19. 21.
every thing should be done, Ex. 25. 8, 9, 10. Exodus 39. 42, 43. Heb. 9. 19, 21.

3 When God sanctified Cities of Refuge, he did thereby command his people to
sanctify them; it is said, that they sanctified Kedesh in Galilee for a place
of refuge, Jos. 20. 7. they did sanctify it, because God had commanded them to
sanctify it, Deuteronomy. 19. 2. they might not sanctify any City, but by virtue of
Gods command, as it is expressed in Number. 35. 6, 11.

4 When God sanctified Festival days, or Festival Sabbaths, he did thereby
command the Sons of Israel to sanctify them, Lev. 23. and Jeroboam is branded
as a wicked opposer of Gods sanctified Sabbaths, because he commanded a
standing Holy Day to the Lord of his own head, 1 King. 12. 32, 33.

From these, and such like examples, it follows, that when God sanctified the
seventh day, he commanded Adam and Eve to sanctify the seventh day in the use
of such Ordinances as he was pleased to bless the seventh day withal; Jesus
Christ did not leave the sanctifying of the seventh day to Adams discretion in
an arbitrary way how much time he would set apart for Gods service, but by
sanctifying the seventh day God commanded Adam to set apart the whole day for
his service in such public and private duties he had blessed the Sabbath
withal.

2 The word Sanctified implies another command to fallen When God sanctified the
seventh day, he did thereby command Adam to prepare himself for the better
sanctifying of the seventh day. Joel 2. 15.
Adam, namely to prepare himself to the sanctification of the Sabbath; First,
By an outward; And secondly, By an inward preparation: Sanctify a Fast, call a
solemn Assembly, Joel 1. 14. that is to say, Prepare your selves to meet me in
a day of public Fasting, as it is explained in Joel, 2. 15. Blow the Trumpet
in Zion, Sanctify a Fast, Calla solemn Assembly; that is to say, Warn the
people by a Trumpet to prepare themselves to sanctify a Fast, Joels three
terms in verse. 5. are all Synonima, and do all imply that Gods people must
prepare themselves for a day of Fasting; First, Outwardly, by sanctifying, or
washing their bodies and garments; And secondly, Inwardly, by true humiliation
of soul; and in this sense also God commanded Joshua to sanctify the people
against they came into his presence on the morrow, Jos. 7. 13. Now all that
Joshua did, to sanctify the people, was no more but to warn them by a
Proclamation through the Camp (which usually was attended with the sound of a
Trumpet) saying, Sanctify your selves, it is as much as if he had said, God
has commanded you to sanctify your selves; First, Outwardly, by washing; And
secondly, by inward repentance, against you come into his presence on the
morrow.

So when God commanded Moses to sanctify the people to hear the Law delivered
at Mount Sinai, Moses did no otherwise sanctify them but by commanding the
people to prepare themselves in a sanctified manner; First, By inward fear and
reverence; And secondly, by outward washing, and by abstinence from their wives
two days together, for their more reverent attention of Gods Law, Exodus* 19.
10. Jos. 3. 5. Exodus 3. 5. 1 Samuel 16. 5. Number. 11. 18. Exodus 19. 10. Jer* 6 4.
So in like sort, when God said, Sanctify War, it is a command to prepare for
War, Jer. 6. 4. Jer. 51. 28.

From these, and such like instances, it follows, That when God sanctified the
first seventh day, he commanded Adam and Eve (for the more solemnity) to
prepare themselves for the sanctifying of the seventh day; God having made a
promise to them in the end of the sixth day, that the Seed of the Woman should
break the head of the Serpent, he sanctified the next day for a Sabbath of
rest, because he had blessed it with Ordinances, and thereby he did command
Adam and Eve to prepare themselves against they came into his holy presence on
the morrow, for sin had desiled them, and therefore they needed to prepare
themselves, not only by outward washing, but also inwardly by true repentance,
Act. 22. 16. 1 Pet. 3. 15. Es. 29. 23. or else instead of receiving good by
that blessing wherewith God had blessed the seventh day, they might expect a
curse, at least an outward curse upon their bodies, as it fell out upon Aarons
Sons, when they did not sanctify the Lord in his worship according to his
command, the Lord struck them with present death, saying, I will be sanctified
in all that come near me, Lev. 10. 3. and when some of Ephraim and Manasses did
come to the sanctified Passover in the days of Hezekiah, God was displeased
with them, because they had not prepared themselves thereto according to the
sanctified, or commanded preparation of the Sanctuary; but Hezekiah prayed for
them, and the Lord heard him, and healed the people, 2 Chr. 30, 18, 19, 20.

2 I will speak a little more of the word Sanctified, as it implies a command
to fallen man to prepare himself to sanctify the seventh day, for all
sanctified things must be remembered by way of preparation before hand, that so
they may be done in due time and order, or else God that is jealous of his
sanctified things, will be displeased.

And therefore one Reason why the word Remember was after added to the fourth
Commadement was (not to add a new sense to that Command more than it had to
Adam under the word Sanctified) but to increase the charge of preparation, with
more vehemence, which at the first was co^ched under the word Sanctified; for
now the people of God had forgotten the charge that was contained in the word
Sanctified; and therefore when Jesus Christ did give the fourth Commandment at
Mount Sinai by the Ministry of Moses, he added the word Remember, saying,
Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it, Exodus 20. 8. for about three Exodus
20. ^.
weeks before this (as the time may be calculated by comparing Exodus 16. 1.
with Exodus 19. 1.) Christ Jesus (by Moses) had said thus to the people,
Tomorrow is the Rest of the Holy Sabbath unto the Exodus 16. 23*
Lord, Exodus 16. 23. Christ Jesus did not now speak these words to them by way
of a first Institution of the Sabbath, but by way of admonition to prepare
themselves to observe it as a holy or sanctified day already commanded; for how
else did the seventh day come to be now called the Holy Sabbath, but by a
former command? for every holy thing is first commanded of God; and therefore
that they might the better remember the holy Sabbath to sanctify it, Christ
Jesus restrained the falling of Manna, so that there was no Manna rained upon
that day, as there was upon all the other six days; by which wonder God did
charge the people to remember the Sabbath day, and to prepare themselves for it
by preparing the food of the Sabbath on the sixth day; and yet for all this, it
came to pass, that there went out some of the people to gather (Manna) and
they found none; thereupon the Lord Jesus said thus unto Moses, How long refuse
you to keep my Commandments* and my Laws, Exodus 16. 27, 28. Hence it is
evident, that Jesus Christ had made a Law for the keeping of the Sabbath,
before he Exodus 16. 27, 28.
gave the fourth Commandment at Mount Sinai, and no other time for that Command
can be found in all the Scripture, but Genesis 2. 3. and there it is couched under
the word Sanctified, therefore when God did sanctify the first seventh day, he
did under that word, not only command Adam to sanctify the seventh day* but
under that word he did also command him to prepare himself to sanctify it, for
that word contains as much, as if he had said to Adam, Remember to sanctify it
by the practice of such public and private Ordinances, as I have blessed the
seventh day withal* for thy good, and prepare thy self thereto with all
carfulness.

From all these considerations it is evident, that Jesus Christ has ever been
uniform in his command touching the sanctified use of the seventh day, even
from the very first institution of it, in Genesis 2. 3. until he had finished the
typical rest of it by his Death and Resurrection, and the Hebrew Doctors agree
thus ^ar* for they say, That all the Fathers observed the Sabbath before Moses
time. See Rambam in Genesis 26. fol. 46. and Aben Ezra in Exodus 20.

Conclusion.
The word Sanctified in Genesis 2. 3. implies, 1 A Command to sanctify the
seventh day, in the practice of such Ordinances both public and private, as it
pleased Jesus Christ to bless the seventh day withal.

2 It implies a Command to prepare themselves for Gods presence, and so it
contains as much as the preface to the fourth Command does, Remember the
seventh day to sanctify it, for all sanctified things must be remembered by way
of preparation, or else God that is jealous of his sanctified time, will
destroy such as come unpreparedly into his holy presence.

CHAP. XI.
Showing how God sanctified the outward Rest of the seventh Day to be a typical
sign, both of his own Rest, and of man's Rest in the Seed of the Woman for the
breaking of the Devils Headplot for man's Redemption.

GOd did not sanctify the outward rest of the seventh day as a typical sign of
his Resting from the labor of his visible Creation, as I have elsewhere noted.

But God Rested the seventh day, and sanctified that day of Rest, because his
soul did now rest upon the Rock Christ, who had undertaken man's Re-creation,
and the government of the whole Creation in opposition to Satan's Head-plot,
then Gods Soul rested on the seventh day, and was refreshed: If God had rested
on the seventh day whiles Adam stood in a mutable condition, his rest had been
but an imperfect and uncertain rest, because of Adams speedy fall, God did not
therefore rest, nor sanctify that rest as a typical sign of his rest, and of
man's rest in the Seed of the Woman, till after Adams Fall and Re-creation, as I
have noted formerly.

And it is evident* that God did not ordain the holy Rest of the seventh day,
nor any other thing to be a sanctified sign of his grace in Christ, as long as
any of those things did lack any thing to the perfection thereof. As for
example.

1 When God sanctified the Tabernacle as a type of the humane nature of Christ,
he did not sanctify it, that is to say* he did not command it to be sanctified
as long as it lacked any thing to the perfection thereof, but as soon as it had
its perfection of being finished and reared up, he sanctified it* Number. 7* 1.

2 They did not sanctify the Altar until it was finish^d and made perfect,
neither might they offer any offering upon the Altar after it was made, until
it was sanctified by the holy anointing oil, etc.

3 God did not sanctify Aaron and his Sons, as a type of the Priestly Person
of Christ, until they had completely fulfilled all the typical Ceremonies that
did appertain to their Priestly Office, Ex. 28. 3. 41. Ex. 29. 1. 9. L^v. 8. 10.

4 God did not sanctify the firstborn of Israel to his service, until he had
perfectly redeemed them from the destruction that fell upon all the Firstborn
of Egypt, Number. 8. 17. but then after they were perfectly delivered, he
commanded Moses to speak to all Israel to sanctifi^ them to the Lord, Exodus 13.
2. namely* after a new Moon had gone over them, for until a new Moon had gone
over them, they lacked of the time that God had appointed for their redemption,
and then their price was given to the Lord, Lev. 27. 6.

5 God did not command the Holy City to be sanctified until the wall was
finished, and the doors thereof set up, but as soon as all this was finished,
and perfected, then it was sanctified, and the Dedication thereof kept with
great joy, Neh. 3. 1. with Neh. 12. 27. etc.

Now from these, and such like I^stances, It follows, that God, could not be
said to sanctify the outward rest of the seventh day to be a typical sign of
his Rest, and of man's Rest in the Mediator, as long as Adam stood in a mutable,
or unconfirmed condition: But as soon as God had perfected his Creation by a
Re-creation, and had established the Government of all upon the Rock Christ,
whose work is perfect, then God blessed and sanctified the seventh day, because
in it he had rested from all his Work which God had created and made.

But I shall yet a little further endeavor to make this point more evident,
namely, that the sanctified rest of the seventh day was ordained to be as a
sanctified sign of fallen man's resting on the promised seed by faith, for the
breaking of the Devils Headplot for Man's redemption, and so consequently as a
sign of man's eternal rest in Heaven hereafter.

Reas. 1. Because the Sabbath (in respect of the strict rest of it) is called a
sign of the everlasting Covenant, Exodus 31. 13. 17. Exodus 31. 13 ^7 Heb. 4. 3,
9, 10
Heb. 4. 3, 9, 10. now there is no everlasting Covenant but that which is made
in the Blood of Christ, and this Covenant of bringing man to Life thereby, is
the only sure thing to rest upon, but this Covenant was not made with Man in
innocence, but after his Fall, therefore the Sabbath was not ordained to be a
sign of this everlasting Covenant, till after Adam fell, and therefore Adam
fell, and before the seventh day.

Reas. 2. Because God ordained sundry other things to be sanctified types and
signs of man's resting on Christ by faith, as Synonima to the rest of the
seventh day, as any that have their understandings well exercised in the
Scriptures may easily discern.

1 Consider this, that God sanctified the outward rest of all the Festival
Sabbaths, as the type of our resting on the Seed of the Woman by faith, for the
breaking of the Devils head-plot; and this is evident by Moses description of
them in Levit. 23. there he reckons up eight several Festival Sabbaths in
order, but he puts the seventh day first, because it is the chiefest of them
all, for it is the ground and foundation of all the rest; and it is to be
specially noted, that Moses does call the seventh day a Festival Sabbath, ver.
2. as well as all the rest, and yet it was no Feasting Sabbath in respect of
Belly-cheer, as the rest were, except in a Spiritual sense, and in that sense
the Holy Rest of them all did typifie the same spiritual resting on the seed of
the Woman, and the same spiritual feasting on the propitiatory Sacrifice of
Christ for Man's redemption, which was typified by their feasting on their
Peace Offerings on their Festival Sabbaths, and so the day of Atonement though
it were a day of strict fasting, yet it was a day of Spiritual feasting, and
resting on the promised Seed, as the seventh day was.

2 The sanctified rest of the seventh day did typifie the same things that
Josuahs rest did, for in six years War he conquered the Canaanites, and in the
seventh year the Land rested. The Apostle does make this rest, and the rest of
the seventh day to be both alike, Heb. 4. for he does first make them to
typifie our Spiritual rest on Christ by faith, and secondly to typifie our
eternal rest in Heaven at last, Heb. 4. 3. 9, 10. Heb. 4. 3, 9, 10


3 The Sabbatical years of rest in Lev. 25. and the Sabbatical Jubilee of rest
(which is also called a great Sabbath, in Levit. 25. 4.) did alike typifie our
resting on Christ by faith, for our full deliverance from the servitude of
Satan; just answerable to the typical rest of the seventh day, and in that
respect Moses does Exodus 23. 10, 11, 12.
compare the typical rest of them all together, in Exodus 23. 10, 11, 12.

None can be ignorant of the manifold great troubles that did often fall out
upon Gods people in the Land of Canaan, soon after the rest which it had in
Joshuahs seventh year; but yet notwithstanding so sweet was that rest which
Joshua obtained for them after six years War, that God was pleased to make that
year of rest to begin the Chronology of all their Sabbatical years of rest
from thence, till all ended in the Death and Sacrifice of Christ, who is the
true rest of all believing sinners; and by allusion to this typical rest, our
Savior does invite all poor and heavy laden sinners to come unto him, and
they shall find rest to their souls, Matthew. 11. 29. Es. 11. 10. Eze. 34. 15,
25, 27, 28, Jer. Mat. 11. 29
33. 15, 16. Jer. 30. 10.

And our Savior in Luke 4. 19. does expound the true nature of Luke 4. 18, 19
that spiritual rest that was typified by the Sabbatical rest of the Jubilee,

1 By calling it the acceptable year of the Lord; and

2 By telling us in verse. 18, that God had anointed him to preach the Gospel
to the poor, to heal the Brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the Captives,
and recovering of Sight to the Blind, and that he should set at liberty them
that are bruised; this opens the sweet rest and refreshing of Soul, that every
poor humbled sinner does find by the seed of the Woman in breaking the Devils
Head-plot for their deliverance, help, and healing.

And this famous deliverance by the seed of the Woman was accomplished by his
propitiatory sacrifice in a Sabbatical year of Jubilee, namely in the twenty
eighth Jubilee, as may be seen in Broug^tons Consent.

4 The redemption of Israel out of Egypt (by the Typical sign of the Blood of
the Paschal Lamb) is laid down as the main reason why God did sanctify the
rest of the seventh day, in Deuteronomy* Deuteronomy. 5. 14, 15
5. 14, 15. and that shows, that not the Visible, but the Spiritual Creation
was the true ground and reason why God blessed and sanctified the first seventh
day. Hence it follows from the Premises, that the Holy Rest of the seventh day
was a typical sign of our resting on Christ by faith for our redemption from
Satan's Head-plot.

Object. Why does God in Exodus 20. 11, command man to rest on the Exodus 20. 11
Sabbath Day from all bis Works, because he rested on the seventh day from
Creating, the Heavens and the Earth, and all things therein, visible and
invisible, Col. 1. 16. seeing in Deuteronomy. 5. 15. he gives another differing
reason, as the only ground of commanding man to rest on the Sabbath Day, Deuteronomy.
5. 15
because Jehovah thy God brought thee out of Egypt by a strong hand, namely by
killing all their first born, but delivering the first born of Israel by the
blood of the Lamb sprinkled on their door posts, as a sign of their redemption?
etc.

Answ. I answer, that the true ground and reason of Gods rest, and of his
commanding man to rest, in both places is alike, there is no difference at all
if the true sense of both places be rightly understood; for God rested not
from the works of Creaation Our Redempt^on from Satan's Head-plot was the last
finishing act of the whole Creation, therefore it must needs be the only true
reason of Gods rest, and of his commanding man to rest on the first seventh day.
until he had made the Heavens and the Earth, and all things therein, as
Christ does testify, Exodus 20. 11. now if all things in Heaven and Earth were
made in six days, then were the Souls of Adam and Eve Re-created in the said
six days, as a true part of that sort of Creature which appertains to the
spiritual Heavens, and to the spiritual Earth, and to the Church triumphant in
Heaven hereafter, and therefore seeing God made all things both in Heaven and
Earth in six days, he rested not on the seventh day till he had perfected Man's
Creation by a Recreation procured by the redemption of the promised Seed, which
doubtless was the finishing work of Gods Creation on the sixth day; so then,
our redemption from Satan's Head-plot was the last finishing act of the whole
Creation, and therefore it was the only true reason of Gods rest on the first
Sabbath Day, and of his command, why man should keep a holy rest on that day,
as it is also typified by the Redemption from Egypt, as in Deuteronomy. 5. 15.

Hence it follows by necessary consequence, that God ordained the sanctified
rest of the seventh day to be a typical sign unto fallen Man of his resting
upon Christ by faith, to break the Devils Head-plot, for his Redemption, by his
propitiatory sacrifice in the fullness of time, and then upon the performance
thereof the typical use of the rest of the seventh day must cease, and yet such
a way must be found out by the Wisdom of God, as that the seventh part of time
according to the account of the days of the Week must not cease, but it must
still be preserved for the exercise of Gods public Worship: for seeing it has
pleased God to continue his plain and manifest Worship still to the end of the
world, it has pleased him also to continue the seventh day for the exercise of
his public Worship to the end of the world; and no other way can be found out
to accomplish both these, namely the ceasing of the seventh day as it was a
typical sign, and the continuance of the seventh day without any intermission,
as it is the sanctified time of Gods public Worship, but by changing the
seventh day into the first day of the Week, as I shall hereafter show more at
large God willing.

And this answer to the abovesaid Objection is the rather to be credited,
because the Redemption from Egypt by the typical blood of the Lamb, is alleged
by Christ as the general reason to enforce his people to the observation of all
the Commandments, for the Angel of the Covenant says thus in Exodus 20. 2. I
Exodus 20. 2 Deuteronomy. 5. 14, 15.
am the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt (namely by
the typical blood of the Paschal Lamb) therefore remember the Sabbath Day to
sanctify it; and so it must be applied as a reason to observe all the other
Commandments; and this sense is yet further enforced, because all the precepts
of the Law were sprinkled with the typical blood of Christ's sacrifice of
Atton^ment, Exodus 24. 8. which does plainly tell us, that he by his sacrifice
Exodus 24. 8.
of Atonement has procured his Fathers atonement for all our sins, against
all his holy Law.

5 God does account the violation of the Holy Rest of the seventh day by any
man's work to be an exceeding great profaneness in every place of their abode,
for whiles his people were in their travels in the Wilderness, he did as
deeply blame them for polluting the typical rest of the seventh day, as he did
after they were in a settled resting place in Canaan, Eze. 20. 13.

Esau was branded with the title of Profaneness, for contemning his
Birthright in the Land of Canaan, because it was a type of the holy militant
Church here on earth, and of the holy triumphant Church in Heaven; and the Jews
were no less guilty of profaneness, for despising the Typical rest on the
seventh day, by doing their own works therein, for by doing their own works
they committed a double sin on that day; First, They profaned it as it was a
sanctified sign; and, Secondly, They abused it as it was the sanctified time of
Gods Worship, and therefore for this double sin God provided as it were a
double death, namely, 1. Stoning to death, Exodus 31. 14, 15. (for he that Exodus
31. 14, 15.
gathered sticks upon the Sabbath Day was stoned to death, Number. 15.) and 2.
After they were stoned to death, their dead Carcas was hanged upon a Tree, for
their deeper punishment, and for the greater detestation of their sin, as I
have showed elsewhere from the instance of the rebellious Son in Deuteronomy. 21.

Yea, God was so jealous for the holy rest of his Sabbath, that he would not
permit them to do any work at all about the promoting of the work of the
Tabernacle, though he had commanded that work to be done with all diligence,
Exodus 31. 13. as the Exodus 31. 13
place of his holy presence and residence among his people, Exodus 25. 8, 22.
yet notwithstanding all this, they might not do any work (to further the
building of it) upon the Sabbath Day, and the reason is added, because I (says
the Lord) have ordained it to be a sign between me and you, that you may know
that I am the Lord that do sanctify you; that is to say, I am the Lord that do
command you to sanctify the Sabbath Day (as a sign of resting on Christ) for
when God does sanctify any thing for man's use, he does thereby impose a
command upon man to sanctify that thing, or to use it as a sanctified thing,
as I have erewhile noted in the beginning of this Chapter, and therefore in
this respect the Lord does in Exodus 31. again and again enforce the observation
of the Sabbath Day; First, By a fresh charge, Ye shall keep the Sabbath; and
Secondly, by a fresh reason, It is holiness to you; namely, it is a sign of
Sanctification to you, ver. 14. yea it is Holiness to Jehovah, ver. 15. and
therefore in Exodus 16. 23. it is called the rest of Holiness to Jehovah, or an
exact holy rest to Jehovah; and in Exodus 31. 17. It is called a sign of the
Everlasting Covenant between Exodus 31. 17
Jehovah, and the Sons of Israel, because Jehovah rested on the seventh day,
and was refreshed.

Conclusion.
It follows from all the Premises, that God sanctified the rest of the seventh
day, not only as the sanctified time of Gods worship, both in public, and in
private, but also as a sanctified sign of Gods resting, and of man's resting on
the Seed of the Woman for the breaking of the Devils Head-plot by his
propitiatory Sacrifice of Atonement, which he should accomplish at the very
same time when the Devil by his instruments should pierce him in the
foot-soals; and therefore as soon as the Seed of the Woman had finished that
sacrifice, the Holy-rest of the seventh day ceased (as well as all the other
types of Moses Law, 2 Cor. 3. 7.) namely, so far forth as it was a typical sign
of the said resting on the Seed of the Woman: But yet still, as the seventh day
was the sanctified time of Gods worship, so it must still continue for the
exercise of those Spiritual Ordinances, wherewith God has blessed the seventh
day for the use of all Nations to the end of the world, and because there must
not be any intermission of the seventh part of time according to the days of
the week, therefore the seventh day could not be changed to any other day than
the first day of the week wherein the Seed of the Woman arose from the dead as
an absolute Lord and Conqueror of Satan's Head-plot.

CHAP. XII.
Showing how God did make the first seventh day famous, by honoring the number
Seven ever after with famous respects.

I GOD has made the first seventh day famous in three regards.

1 Because God did bless it with many Spiritual Ordinances, above all the
other fix days, for man's best good.

2 Because God did sanctify it as so much time for the solemnity of his
public worship for ever.

3 Because God did ordain it as a sanctified type, or sign of fallen man's
resting on the Seed of the Woman for the breaking of the Devils Head-plot.

Il. God does often use the number seven in an honorable memo^ial of the first
famous seventh day.

1 God has contrived many of the Typical Ceremonies of our Redemption to be
numbered by seven, in an honorable respect to the first famous seventh day.

2 He has marked out many holy men of special note by the number seven, in an
honorable remembrance of the first famous seventh day.

3 He has framed many parts of the Scripture Chronology to the number seven,
in an honorable remembrance of the first famous seventh day.

1 I will begin to open the first, touching the Typical Ceremonies 1 The
typical Ceremonies of our Redemption are often numbered by Seven in an
honorable memorial of the first famous seventh day. Lev 8. 33. 35. Lev. 29. 30.
of our Redemption.

Seven days were appointed for the consecration of the Priests into their
Priestly office, Exodus 29. 30. in all which seven days they must abide at the
door of the Tabernacle night and day, to keep the watches of the Lord, that no
defilement might befall them, or the Sanctuary, Lev. 8. 33, 35.

And the chief reason why their Consecration must last seven days, was because
the Sabbath (which was ordained as a typical sign of our sanctification by
Christ) might pass over them in that space; and therefore the Hebrew Doctors
say of this action, Great is the Sabbath, for the High Priest enters not upon
his service after he is anointed, until the Sabbath do pass over him.

And also from these seven days of their Consecration, the Hebrew Dectors did
gather, That the High Priest must be separated from his house before he might
do the service of the day of Atonement seven days every year. See Ains. in
the said places.

2 The Altar was seven times sprinkled with oil when it was consecrated to be a
type of the Mediators anointing, When he should make his soul a sacrifice for
our sins, Lev. 8. 11. Lev. 8. 11.


3 The blood of the Sin-offering, which the High Priest offered must be
sprinkled seven times before Jehovah for Atonement, Lev. 4. 6.
Lev. 4. 6. And on the day of Atonement he sprinkled the blood of Atonement
seven times before the Mercy-seat, Lev. 16. 14. Lev. 16. 14.
and seven times upon the Altar, Lev. 16. 19. This sevenfold sprinkling of the
blood of Atonement did type out the perfect Atonement that the Seed of the
Woman should one day make for all the true Israel of God by his propitiatory
Sacrifice of Atonement, and therefore it was offered but once for all, because
Heb. 10. 10, 12, 14.
it was perfect at once. Heb. 10. 10, 12, 14.

4 The number of seven Sacrifices, was often used as a typical number that God
did much delight in; no doubt in relation to the first famous seventh day. As
for example, When David did fetch the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from the
house of Ob^d Edom they offered seven Bullocks, and seven Rams, because the
Lord enabled the Levites to bear the Ark, 1 Chr. 15. 26.

And when Hezekiah caused the Levites to cleanse the Temple, then he (together
with the Princes) brought seven Bullocks, and seven Rams, and seven Lambs, and
seven He-goats for a Sin-offering, 2 Chr. 29. 21.

In like manner Jobs three friends brought unto Job (as the Priest in those
days) seven Bullocks, and seven Rams for a Burnt-offering, Job 42. 8. Job 42.
8.


And in the New Jerusalem the Prince shall offer in the days of
unleavened-bread, seven Ballocks, and seven Rams without blemish, daily at the
time of the seven days, Ezekiel. 45. 23.

And Balaam in imitation of such customs, and in imitation of the first famous
seventh day (which doubtless was famous a long time among the Heathens) he
caused Balack to build seven Altars, and to prepare seven Bullocks, Number. 23. 1.

5 In cleansing of Lepers, the Priest must sprinkle them seven times with
water, wherein the blood of the Bird that was slain was mixed, Lev. 14. 7. and
seven times with oil, before the Lord, verse. 16. 51.

6 Elisha the Prophet bad Naaman to wash seven times in Jordan, and then he
should be cleansed of his Leprosy, 1 King. 5. 10, 14.

7 God allotted seven days for the time of Purification from sundry kinds of
uncleanesse.

1 The Woman in childbed must be seven days separated from the company of her
husband, for a Man-child (just as long as she was separated in the time of her
menstruousnesse) and twice seven days for a female, Lev. 12, 2. Lev. 15. 19.

2 He that touched a dead man must be unclean seven days before he could be
purified.

8 God ordained every seventh year to be a Sabbath of Rest in the land of
Canaan, after that Joshua had given the people rest in the seventh year of his
reign; and when seven times seven years were complete, then began the Jubilee
with the fiftieth year, Lev. 25. 4, 8. 20.

9. The Lord ordained seven sorts of Festivial Sabbaths, besides the seventh
day, as they may be counted in Lev, 23. and the Feast of Unleavened bread, was
a Feast of seven days; and the seventh month was famous above other months,
because it had most Festival Sabbaths in it, and in the seventh month Solomon
kept the Feast of the Dedication of the Temple seven days, and seven days, I
King. 8. 2. 65. and Hezekiah took order, because of the general uncleanness of
the Priests, and of the greater number of the people, in the first month, that
the Feast of Unleavened bread should be put off unto the fourteenth day of the
second month, and then after they had kept the Feast seven days, the whole
assembly took counsel to keep it other seven days not with another Paschal
Lamb, but only with voluntary Peace Offerings; and by this means they kept
that Feast of Unleavened-bread seven days, and seven days, with joy, 2 Chr.
30. 22, 23. 2 Chr. 30. 22, 23.


10 God honored the seventh day by instructing Joshua how to subdue the City
Jericho by the divine art of Seven, he directed him to compass about the City
seven days with the Ark of Gods presence, and seven Priests must go before the
Ark, having seven Trumpets made of seven Rams horns; and on the seventh day
they must compass the City seven times; and at the seventh time the seven
Priests must blow with their seven Trumpets, and then the wall of the City
should fall down flat, Jos. 6, 4, 5.

This divine Miracle by the number seven, was doubtless so done, in honor of
the first famous seventh day, wherein God rested from all his works, when he
had made the Creation perfect and entire, lacking nothing, by the Redemption
and Gubernation of the Promised Seed.

11 It is not without a divine Allusion to the seventh day that the Golden
Candlestick was framed into seven branches, yea all the particulars of it were
so contrived, that when they are exactly counted, they do amount to just six
sevens, as the Hebrew Doctors have cast them; and they say that this number is
so necessary, that if it did but fail in one particular, it failed in all. See
Ains. in Exodus 25. 31.

And accordingly, if it be but regarded, the sixth day and the seventh day have
the most famous stories belonging unto them that are in all the Bible.

12 The number seven is made famous by the Holy Ghost in the Mystical
Revelation (which Christ commanded the Apostle John to write for the use and
benefit of his Redeemed seryan^s) to the end of the world.

There the Vision of the seven Golden Caandlesticks represented the seven
Churches of Asia, and to the said seven Churches there does belong seven Stars,
and seven Angels; there are also seven Angels with seven Trumpets, and seven
Angels with seven Incense cups of wrath, pouring out seven plagues; there are
also seven Thunders uttering seven voices, and a Book with seven Seals; there
are also seven Spirits, seven Horns, and seven Eyes, Rev. 5. On the contrary,
there is given to the Dragon seven Heads, and seven Crowns, Rev. 12* 3. and the
seven Heads are the seven Mountains, Rev. 17. 9. and there are also seven
Kings, etc. Can all these particulars be without any allusion to the first
famous seventh day? I suppose that no advised Expositor dares affirm the
contrary.

2 I come now to the second thing to be marked touching the 2 Diverse ho^^
persons of rare eminency in Sc^ipture are marked out by the number 7. in an
honorable remembrance of the first famous seventh day
number Seven, namely, that God has marked out many holy men of special note
by the number seven in an honorable remembrance of the first famous seventh
day.

1 Henoc is noted by the Holy Ghost, to be a Prophet, and to be the seventh
from Adam, Jude v. 14. He was rare in the faith of Christ, Heb. 11. 5. and he
was by the mighty power of God taken away from the wicked Apostate world
(because they were not worthy of him) when he was Three hundred sixty five
years old, Genesis 5. 23. just answerable to the days of the year (according to
the course of the Sun) and as he was the seventh Patriarch, so when he was
taken away, there remained seven Patriarchs alive as witnesses of his
Translation: And by his name it is evident that his Father did at his Birth
dedicate him to God, in opposition to those Apostate times; for the impiety of
those days is noted out to our hand by the Prophecy of Enoch in Jude v. 14,
15. Behold (says he) the Lord comes with thousands of his Saints, to give
Jude 14, 15
judgment upon all men, and to rebuke all the ungodly among them of all their
wicked deeds which they have impiously committed, and of all their wicked
speakings which wicked sinners have spoken against him. The horrible impiety of
those days is also noted out unto us by the wicked tyrannical speeches of
Lamech and Cain in Genesis 4. 23, 24. and Genesis 4. 23, 24 Job 22. 15 2 Pet. 2. 5
their impiety and wicked speakings is also noted out unto us by Job 22. 15.
and by Peter, for he calls them the world of the ungodly, 2 Pet. 2. 5.

Obj. Here it may be demanded, how it can be proved that Enoch did Prophesy,
that the wicked world should be drowned by a deluge?

Ans. Jude says, that Enoch did Prophesy, saying, Behold, the Lord comes with
thousands of his Saints, to give judgment upon all men; and what other
Judgment did come in general upon all men, but the flood?

Secondly, His Prophecy that God would destroy the wicked World by a Flood, is
briefly, and yet plainly enough declared in the name which he gave to his Son
at his birth, for he called him, Meth-u-shelach, which in English sounds thus;
Meth he dies (or when this Child dies) [ u] then, Shelah he sends, or,
God sends; and what else did God send but the Judgment threatened upon all
men in general (as I noted above) and what judgment was that, but the flood?

This famous Prophet is called the seventh from Adam, doubtless in an
Honorable remembrance of the first famous seventh Genesis 5. 24 Heb. 11. 5
day; Moses says, He walked with God, Genesis 5. 24. but the Apostle does thus
expound it, He pleased God, Heb. 11. 5, 6. for when he offered sacrifice he
looked to Christ the true Sacrifice which only p^easeth God, Mat. 3. 17. and in
the course of his life he walked in obedience to Gods will.

Secondly, Eber was the seventh from Enoch, he was another rare man for grace
and godliness, for he kept the faith at the building of the Tower of Babel,
when all the other Families of Noah did Apostatise, therefore God has honored
his memorial in a double respect.

1 In communicating unto him the spirit of Prophecy as well as he had done to
Enoch, as we may gather by the name which he gave his Son at the building of
Babel, for it is said, that he called his Son Peleg, and the reason is added*
because in his days the earth was divided, Genesis 10. 25. Now he that could give
his Son Genesis 10. 2^
such a name as to declare such an event, must needs be a Prophet; and by this
we may certainly know that he preached to the builders of Babel, that though
they had high imaginations to build a Tower whose top might reach unto Heaven,
that they might in a near distance worship the Sun, Moon, and Stars, thinking
thereby to get themselves another Sem, or name, for now they had rejected Sems
Tents, and had removed themselves (from Canaan where Sem and Eber lived) into
Babylon, in despite of Sem, who had the promise of the blessed Seed to come
from his Ioyns; therefore the Prophet Eber did tell them, that for that impiety
and Apostasy God would confound their Language, and scatter them upon the face
of the earth, and in memory of that Prophecy he called his Son Peleg, and
truly he must needs be a rare Sabbath-keeper, that kept the faith when all the
rest of Noah's family fell away.

2 God has honored Ebers memorial in another respect, namely in that all the
Nations of the Jews are called Ebrews after his name, Genesis 14. 13. Genesis 39. 14,
17. and it seems to me that his constant abode was in the Land of Canaan,
because the Land of Canaan is called the Land of the Ebrews long before the
Jews came out of Egypt to dwell there, Genesis 40. 15. And secondly, because his
great Grandfather Sem (who was the King of Salem in the Land of Canaan) is
called the Father of all the Sons of Eber, Genesis 10. 21. Sem was the Father of
many other Families Genesis 10. 21
besides Ebers, but for some special reason (namely, of their Co-habitation)
Ebers Sons are called Sems Sons, for Sem is called the father of them; which I
conceive is to note out unto us that Eber was a close cohabiter and familiar
with Sem in the faith of Christ, when all the other Families did Apostatise,
and depart from them to Babylon to worship new gods.

Master Broughton says, That the Hebrew Tongue remained only in the faithful
of Ebers House after the building of Babel, and in them is continued the name
of Ebrews, as perpetually opposite to the builders of Babel, to whom Eber
preached, that their tongues should be divided, Prin. Posit. p. 3.

3 Isaac was the seventh from Eb^r; his faith is famous, in his ready obedience
to be sacrificed, for he was at that time in the prime of his strength, because
he carried all the Wood for the Burnt-offering up the Hill, Genesis 22. 6. and
therefore he might well be about thirty three years of age when he went with his
Father Abraham up to the Mount of Moriah to be sacrifised, and therefore also
he was able by strength of Nature, if he had been unwilling to be bound, to
have withstood his aged Father, who was now one hundred and thirty three years
old, and therefore he was in the declining of his Natural strength; and he
might the more easily have withstood his aged Father, because they two were
alone, and none there to help Abraham.

And now seeing Abraham's faith is recorded to be famous, in that he did so
readily obey Gods command, not sparing to sacrifise his only Son at his
command, Isaacks faith is therewithal recorded to be no less famous, in that
he was so cheerfully willing to be bound, and to be sacrifised; they both knew
that God was able to raise him up again from the dead, Heb. 11. 19. Heb. 11. 19
and thus God made his obedience to be a sweet typical resemblance, not only of
the free and voluntary, but also of the actual obedience of Jesus Christ, to
make his Soul a sacrifice for our sins, Es. 53. 10. Es. 53. 10


4 Moses was the seventh from Abraham, by no less rare Providence of God than
Enoch was the seventh from Adam.

5 Joshua was the seventh from his Grandfather Ephraim, and David was the
seventh son of Jesse.

6 Judah was the seventh Patriarch, as the Hebrew Doctors do in this order
count him.

First, Abraham; second, Isaac; third, Jacob; fourth, Ruben; fifth, Simeon;
sixth, Levy; seventh, Judah; and in this respect the Hebrew Doctors do compare
him to the first seventh day.

Secondly, In another respect they do compare him to the fourth Commandment,
namely, as he was the fourth Son of Israel, and so both these ways they do make
his memorial Honorable by their allusion to the first famous seventh day. See
Ains. in Genesis 49. 12.

7 Bazaliel the Master-work-man of the Lords Tabernacle was the seventh from
Judah, as it is evident by his Genealogy in 2 Chro. 2. 5, 9, 18, 19, 20.

In all these holy Persons the providence of God ought to be sweetly
considered; for it does manifestly call to our remembrance the famousnesse of
the first seventh day, by his disposing of great matters, and gracious, most
often by sevens.

3 God has framed many parts and parcels of the Scripture 3 There are several
parcels of the Scripture Chronology that are f^amed to the number seven, in an
Honorable remembrance of the first famous seventh day. Levit. 25 4
Chronology to the number seven, doubtless in an Honorable remembrance of
the first famous seventh day.

1 When Gods people neglected the holy Sabbath, and profaned the holy Rest of
it, then God did threaten to punish them with Sabbatical years of punishment,
as in the Captivity of Babylon with ten times seven years Captivity, that the
Land might rest and enjoy her Sabbaths all the time it lay desolate, 2 Chronicles.
36. with Ier. 25. and Levit. 26. and is it not a manifest allusion to the first
famous seventh day, in that God does call sevens of years Sabbaths of years,
Levit. 25. 4. and threaten them with Sabbatical years of punishment, for
profaning the rest of the holy Sabbath?

2 At the just end of these seventy years Daniel has annexed a Sabbatical
Chronicle, which does notably lead on, not only the Sabbatical year: of rest,
but even the weekly Sabbaths also unto the death and burial of Christ, Dan. 9.
24. for,

1 Christ dyed for our Redemption, and rose again for our Justification in a
Sabbatical Jubilee, even in the twenty eighth Jubilee, and from the liberties
of the Jubilee the ancient Hebrew Doctors did foresee, and know, and say, That
the Divine Majesty will be to Israel in a Iubilee, Freedom, Redemption, and
Finisher of Sabbaths. See H. Bro. in Sinai Sight, 2560. and in Req. of Consent,
p. 13.

2 Daniel by his Sabbatical Chronicle does also lead on the weekly Sabbaths to
the death and bu^ial of Christ; for First, Christ dyed on the first day of the
f^ast of unleavened Bread, which John calls a High Sabbath, Ioh. 19. 31. and
Secondly, on the next day, which was the weekly Sabbath, or seventh day, his
Body rested all that day in his Grave, and his Soul in Heaven, for as soon as
he had finished the Work that God gave him to do, he Heb. 4. 10.
rested from all his Works on the seventh day, as God did from his own on the
first seventh day.

3 He rose again from the dead on the third day, for Christ did fore-tel this
to his Disciples, that on the third day he Luke 13. 32 Mat. 12. 40.
should be perfected, Luke 13. 32. for as soon as he had performed his
propitiatory Sacrifice, or his sacrifice of Atonement, by which the Devils
Head-plot was broken, he was declared by his Resurrection to have made a
perfect Conquest over Satan, and a perfect Atonement with God his Father for
man's Redemption; and this day of his Resurrection was the first day of the week
by Paul, but John calls it, the Lords Day, because in it Christ rose from the
Dead, as an absolute Lord and Conqueror of Satan's Head-plot; and therefore now
seeing his Death was declared to be a perfect sacrifice of Atonement, God made
him both Lord and Christ, and thereupon Christ has ordained that day to be
the day of his public Worship in the place of the seventh day, to the end of
the world.

Thus have I declared the first seventh day to be made famous and honorable by
three several sorts of instances that have relation to Gods resting, and to
Man's resting on the seventh day, in relation to the work of our Redemption by
the promised Seed.

CHAP. XIII.
Proving, That though Christ has abolished the seventh day by his death, yet
that he has not left the day of his public Worship Arbitrary to particular
Churches, to appoint what day they please in the place of the seventh day, as
some unadvised Protestants do affirm.

I Have already showed you, that God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it,
because that in it he rested from all his works that belonged either to the
heavenly or the earthly Host, and that his finishing Act lay in this, namely,
in ordaining the Seed of the Woman to break the Devils Head-plot, and when that
Headplot was broken then God rested, and was refreshed, and then also he
sanctified the outward rest of the seventh day, to be a sign both of Gods rest,
and of Man's rest on the Seed of the Woman; as soon therefore as the Seed of the
Woman had broken the Devils Head-plot, by his propitiatory sacrifice of
Atonement, the holy rest of the seventh day must cease, as it was a type or
sign of that which is now performed.

But yet withal I pray remember what I have said upon the word Sanctified,
namely, that thereby God commanded fallen Man to set apart the seventh day for
a double use; 1. As the sanctified time of that Worship wherewith he had
blessed the seventh day; and, 2. As a sanctified sign; in this last respect the
seventh day is abolished by the death of Christ; but in the first respect,
namely as it was set apart for so much time to be employed in the exercise of
such Ordinances both public and private, as God had blessed the seventh day
withal, so it must continue, namely, the seventh part of time according to the
days of the Week, in a constant succession to the first seventh day to the end
of the world.

And indeed the seventh part of time cannot be translated to any other day of
the Week, but to the next day after the seventh day; for if it had been
translated to any other day, God should have been a loser of his seventh part
of sanctified time, there would have been a vacuum in the revolution of the
seventh part of time, at least in the first translation of it to any other day
but the first day of the Week, and so the roundnesse of the seventh part of
time would have been spoiled, which must not be admitted; for as God did not
allow less than six parts of the Week for Man's civil employments, so neither
will he have less time for his public worship than he appointed at first.

Therefore it would have been a great dishonor to Christ, who is made of God
to be both the Lord of his Church, and the Lord of the Sabbath, if he had left
the day of his public Worship arbitrary to each particular Church, to
transfer it to what day they pleased; A man may with as good reason affirm,
That Christ has left the outward Form of his public Worship arbitrary to each
particular Church, as affirm, That he has left the day of his public Worship
arbitrary; there is as much reason for the one as for the other; for Jesus
Christ by his death has made as much alteration in the second Commandment, in
respect of his outward Worship, as in the fourth Commandment, in respect of
the change of the day.

Secondly, the very order of the Ten Commandments does plainly tell us, that
all Gods public Worship (which is fully comprehended in the second
Commandment) must have a public day appointed by God himself, for the
constant exercise of his said public Worship; and consequently it follows,
that as soon as Christ had abolished the seventh day by his death, he being the
Lord of his Church, and the Lord of the Sabbath, must establish another certain
day in the place of the seventh day to the end of the world, without any
intermission or loss of time.

The order of the four Commandments of the first Table, lies thus.

1 The first Commandment does enjoin us to worship the true God alone, in
Unity and Trinity, with the whole inward man.

2 The second Commandment does enjoin us to worship the true God with all such
outward worship as he had commanded at that present, or should command
afterward.

3 The third Commandment does enjoin us to worship God in a holy manner, both
publicly and privately, and with outward reverence, as well as inward.

4 The fourth Commandment does enjoin us to observe the seventh day, not only
as a sanctified sign, but also as the sanctified time of that worship wherewith
God had blessed the seventh day; as soon therefore as Christ the Seed of the
Woman had accomplished that work of breaking the Devils Head* plot* by his
Propitiatory Sacrifice, the seventh day, in regard it was a sanctified sign,
must cease; but as it was the sanctified time of Gods public worship, so it
must not cease, but it must still be continued, or else Gods public worship
must suffer loss and confusion, no other way can be found out, by which the
constant solemnity of Gods established worship may be continued, but by
translating the seventh day to the next day; for by that means only, God shall
still have the seventh part of time for his public worship, without
interruption; and by this means only the twofold manner of sanctifying the
seventh day, does attain its several ends.

2 Let it be a little further inquired into, To what end did God command all
his public worship in the second Command? and to what end did he command all
his public worship to be reverently performed in the third Command, if the day
of his public worship in the fourth Command be wholly obliturated?

3 Consider, that the command of Christ is that all his public worship must be
done decently and in order, 1 Cor. 14. and seeing he does require that the
meanest circumstances of his worship be done decently and in order, no doubt
but he has taken order that the main things of his public worship should be
done decently and in order, and that cannot be without some public day be
uniform. But if Christ Jesus has left the day of his public worship arbitrary
to his particular Churches, they will hardly agree upon a way of decency,
especially in respect of the solemnity of time, doubtless they will appoint
several days of the week as every Church shall think best for their own
conveniences; yea it may be that some particular Churches may grow so corrupt,
that they may think one day in a month sufficient, and others may think one day
in two or three months sufficient for Gods public worship; and who can prevent
such disorders a^ these* if Jesus Christ has not established a standing day?

There are some that profess Christianity that think that Jesus Christ has
not established a certain public day in place of the seventh day; and
therefore they do still hold the Jewish Sabbath, together with the Lords day;
As for example, The Melchites or Syrians (who are esteemed for number to be the
greatest Sect of Christians in the Orient) these do confound the day of Gods
public worship; for they, and the Maronites their neighbors, do observe the
Jewish Sabbath, as solemnly as the Lords day. See Brerewood in his Inquiries,
p. 129.

And the Habbissines of Ethiopia, who are another large Territory of
Christians, they also do reverence the Jewish Sabbath equal to the Lords day.
See Brerewood, p. 155. But blessed be God that has given the Churches of
Europe a cleerer understanding of his will touching the day of his public
worship, and yet notwithstanding, it is also much to be lamented, that some
Christians do not only hold the seventh day to be abolished, but also that
Christ Jesus has not established any public day in the place of the old.

But let me reason a little further, Can any man that is well acquainted with
the order of the Commandments of the first Table, think that Christ (who
blessed the seventh day with several Ordinances for the good of fallen man, and
that sanctified that day for the exercise of the said Ordinances) should now
obliturate that Commandment, and sanctify no day at all for the exercise of
his said Ordinances? Can any man think that Christ should now after his death,
be so far unlike to his first pattern? Surely me thinks none should be so
inconsiderate. The holy Rest of the seventh day as it was a typical sign, so I
grant it to be abolished, but not without any other in the place of it, but by
way of exchange for the next day; And this the blessed Martyr Stephen does
explain to be the truth; for when he was accused for affirming that Jesus of
Nazareth should destroy the holy place, and change the Customs that Moses had
delivered Act 6. 14.
unto them, Act. 6. 14. his false witnesses did affirm this word Change against
Stephen, as if it had been an odious herefie to say so; but how does Stephen
answer to this Accusation? Does he deny it? No, he does acknowledge it to be a
truth in it self, and therefore in his Oration to the High Synedrion, he does
confirm this to be a truth, by saying thus to them; Solomon built him a house,
Howbeit the most High dwells not in Temples made with hands, as says the
Prophet (in Es. 66. 1.) What house will ye build for me, says the Lord, or
what place is it that I should rest in, Has not my hand made all these things?
Act. 7. 47. to 50. with these words Stephen does Act. 7. 47.
conclude his Oration. In these words he does reprove the High Synedrion,
because of their obstinate opposing the former Doctrine; for his Doctrine
tended to prove that God would not rest locally in a Temple made with man's
hands, and so consequently, not in any other outward signs, implying, that God
would only rest in Christ the true Temple, whom they had slain.

His false accusers did repeat (though at unawares) and as it D^n. 9. 26, 27.
were translate the words of the Angel Gabriel in Dan. 9. 26, 27. namely, that
the Messiah should by his death destroy the City and Sanctuary, and cause
Sacrifice and Oblation to cease; and this very thing in true effect Stephen had
taught, namely, that Jesus of Nazareth should destroy the holy place, and
change the Customs that Moses had delivered, and so consequently change the
Sabbath; and the Lord from heaven did justify Stephen for this speech, even in
the face of the High Synedrion; for as he looked steadfastly into heaven, he saw
the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; And as he
avouched this before them all, Act. 7. 55, 56. they that sat in the Council
looked Act. 6 15. Act. 7 55.
steadfastly on him, and saw his face as the face of an Angel, Act. 6. 15. And
this does evince, that as Stephen did justify his Doctrine by the words of the
Angel Gabriel, so God did justify him by making his face to shine before the
Council, as the countenance of the Angel Gabriel, by which miraculous glory in
his countenance the Council might have seen that his Doctrine was warranted by
the words of the Angel Gabriel.

Stephen affirmed that which his false witnesses affirmed against him as a
blasphemous thing, that Jesus of Nazaret should change the Customs of Moses:
Hence I reason thus, If Jesus should do it, then he did not leave it to be done
in an arbitrary way by the discretion of particular Churches; But Jesus himself
did it.

Mark the phrase of speaking; Jesus of Nazaret shall change the That Christ
Jesus made three main changes in the ten Commandments.
Customs of Moses: And it is also observable, that Jesus of Nazaret did make
three main changes in the ten Commandments, two in the outward form of his
public worship contained in the second Commandment, and one touching the day
of his public worship in the fourth Commandment.

1 He changed Circumcision and all typical purifyings (which were commanded in
the second Commandment) into the Sacramental Seal of Baptism.

2 He changed the Passover, and all typical Sacrifices, which were also
commanded in the second Commandment, into the Sacramental Seal of the Lords
Supper.

3 He changed the seventh day as it was a typical sign, by translating it to
the first day of the week, wherein Christ rose as a Lord and Conqueror of
Satan's Head-plot, for the day of his public worship, as the seventh day was at
first.

And the Apostle Paul does reason much after the same manner as Stephen did; If
(says he) the Priesthood be changed, there must Heb. 7. 12.
of necessity be a change of the Law, Heb. 7. 12. but the Priesthood is changed
(for Christ was not of the Tribe of Levy, but of Judah, neither was he made a
High Priest by man according to the Law of the carnal Commandment, but (by
God) after the power of endless life) therefore Christ did not leave it to the
power of his particular Churches to change the Ordinances of Moses, but he had
power from God to do it; He takes away the first, that he Heb. 9. 10.
might establish the second, Heb. 9. 10. that is to say, Christ only had power
to take away Sacrifices, and all the other Customs of Moses, that so he might
ratify his own Sacrifice in the place of them all, and therefore for the
memorial of his Sacrifice, he has now ordained two Sacramental Seals, which he
has annexed to the preaching of his Gospel; the one he has appointed as a
Sacrament of initiation to his Church, and the other as a Sacrament of
confirmation to all believers: And therefore Christ Jesus has not now tied his
public worship* neither to typical persons, nor to typical places, nor to
typical days and times, for by his death he has ended all the Types of his
Death; and he has changed the Priesthood of Levy into the number of* the
Elect, Jer. 33. 18, 21, 22. and the typical place of his worship into
particular Churches, and into godly hearts, saying, In every place Incense Mal.
1. 11.
shall b^ offered to my Name, Mal. 1. 11. Joh. 4. 23. Act. 10. 35. And thirdly,
he has changed all the typical Sabbaths of Moses into the Lords day; for
though the Sabbath was first given to Adam, the very next day after his
Creation and Fall; yet as the holy rest of it was a typical sign, so it must be
reckoned among the Customs of Moses, as well as Circumcision was, for (though
at the first, Circumcision was given to Abraham long before Moses, yet) it is
reckoned among the Customs of Moses, because he wrote first of it as it was a
typical sign; So in like fort, though the Sabbath was first given to Adam as a
typical sign, yet it is reckoned among the Customs of Moses, because he first
wrote of it as a typical sign, Exodus 31. 13. etc. and also Moses does reckon it
among all the other Festival Sabbaths, in Lev* 23. therefore it must be
abolished by the death of Christ, as well as all the other typical Customs of
Moses, by changing it into the Lords day, Col. 2. 16, 17. Gal. 4. 10. Act. 21.
21.

Conclusion from the Premises.
That it is not in the power of any particular Church, or Churches, to make
this change; Christ only has power to do it, and he has done it, as he is
the Lord of the Sabbath, and the Lord of his Church, and that day cannot be
altered by any Church or State to the worlds end.

CHAP. XIV.
Proving by several other particular grounds, That Christ himself did appoint
the day of his Resurrection* in the place of the seventh day, for the exercise
of his public worship.

1 I Do not mean that Christ left the day of his public worship Reason 1.
to the discretion of his Apostles, to appoint what day they thought good in
place of the seventh day, though their appointment had been a sufficient
warrant for us, knowing by* what spirit they were guided; but my meaning is,
that Christ himself did appoint the day, and therefore in the day of his
Resurrection he did use means to assemble his Disciples together, that he might
meet with them, and declare unto them the things that app^rtained to the
Kingdom of God; he first appeared to Mary Magdalen, and at her second coming
to his Sepulcher, he bid her tell his Disciples, that He was risen from the
dead, Joh. 20. 17. 18.

Then he appeared unto two of his Disciples as they went from Jerusalem to
Emaus, Luke 24. and he proved his Resurrection to them from the Scriptures, and
opened their understandings to understand what he said; and this he did to draw
them back again to the rest of the Disciples, partly that they might testify
the certainty of his Resurrection, and partly that they might not be absent
from the Assembly when he should come unto them, to instruct them further
concerning his Death and Resurrection. And at that Assembly he also opened
their understandings that they might understand the Scriptures which he
alleged, for he said unto them* Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ
to suffer, and to rise again from the dead the third day, Luke 24* 45, 46.

I grant it was somewhat late in the evening ere Christ came unto their
Assembly; but yet that time of the evening is plainly* called the same first
day of the week, Joh. 20. 19. But the particular Joh. 20. 19.
Scriptures, which he alleged to prove his* Resurrection, are not recorded*
neither by Luke nor John; but yet we may gather by consequence, that when he
spoke of his Death and Resurrection* he might well speak how he had ended all
Moses Ceremonies, and so consequently how he had ended the typical use of the
Sabbath by his death, and then doubtless he would nominate some other day in
the place of it, for the use of his public Worship; or else he had le^t it to
disorder and confusion, if he had lest it arbitrary to particular Churches.

2 As soon as Christ had ended all his instructions concerning Reas. 2.
his Death and Resurrection, he appointed another Joh. 20. 26
meeting on that day seven-night, Joh. 20. 26. and it is evident that this was
the second time of his appearing to their Assembly, because the next time after
this is called the third time, Ioh. 21. 14. I confess, if it can be proved,
that Christ had appeared to them on any other day between the day of his
Resurrection and that day seven-night, then his appearing on that day
seven-night had not been so remarkable; but seeing he did not appear any more
unto them till that day seven-night, it strongly argues, that he did purposely
abstain from them the whole week, to declare his election of that day in the
place of the seventh day; and I am the more confirmed in the truth of this,
because this second time of his meeting was not occasioned by any Sabbatical
feast of the Jews, for the last day of the feast of Unleavened bread (which was
a chief festival Sabbath) was past two days before this second meeting, and
none of the festival days (which doubtl^sse his Apostles kept) was any occasion
of his meeting with them sooner than the same day sevennight after his
Resurrection; it argues therefore that this Assembly of the Apostles and
Disciples was done by Christ's directions; and Luke does testify, that Christ
did give certain Commandments to his Apostles after his Resurrection, being
seen of them at times forty days, and speaking that which appertained to the
Kingdom of God, Acts 1. 2, 3. now what those Commandments were, and what
those things were which he spoke concerning the Kingdom of God, is not
recorded; but yet it may be collected from the practice of the Apostles, in
that they used the first day of the week for Gods public Worship in Christian*
Churches, that Christ did command them to observe that day in place of the
seventh day* as soon as they were separat^d from the Jews Synagogues into
particular Christian Churches; and we may the rather conceive this to be a true
collection, because he did at this present give unto his Apostles a new
Commission to preach the Gospel, Ioh. 20. 21, 22. and the Gospel Joh. 20. 21
was preached not only in Synagogues on the seventh day, but also in Christian
Churches on the Lords Day; yea and before his Ascension he did again command
them, to Preach and Baptize through all the world, Matthew. 28. doubtless
therefore seeing he ordained Baptism as an appendix to the preaching of the
Gospel, and as a badge of the Christian Faith in Christian Churches, he would
not fail to appoint a solemn day* (seeing he had abolished the seventh day by
his death) in which day his command of Preaching and Baptising was ordinarily
to be performed.

And why does John say, That Christ did many other Signs in the presence of his
Disciples, which are not written? Joh. 21. 25. but to teach us that these two
times of his miraculous appearing to his Disciples on the first day of the
week, when the Doors were shut, are written, that we might believe that Jesus
is the Christ the Son of God, Ioh. 20* 30, 31. and that he has not only
abolished the seventh day by his Death, but that he has also established his
Resurrection-day in the place thereof, in which he arose from the Dead, as the
Lord and Conqueror of Satan's Head-plot.

Obj. You say, That the second time of Christ's appearing was the same day
seven-night after his Resurrection; but that cannot be, because John says it
was eight days after, Joh. 20. 26.

Ans. I answer, When John's eight days come to be rightly Joh. 20. 26*
understood, it will appear to be no more but seven nights, and this may the
better be believed, because the Evangelist Luke does make such a kind of
reckoning of days as this is, in Luke 9. 28. Luke 9. 28*
there he says, that the day of Christ's transfiguration was eight days after
his former Miracle, but yet in proper speaking it was no more but seven nights;
and this is evident, because Matthew does make the said space of time to be but
six days, Mat. 17. 1. Mat. 17. ^*
This difference must thus be reconciled; Luke counts into the number of his
eight days the day of the former Miracle, and the day of the latter Miracle,
wherein Christ was transformed; but Matthew does not reckon, neither the day of
the first Miracle, nor the day of the latter Miracle, but only the six whole
days that came between them; so that if you will account Lukes eight days by
nights, then there will be found no more but seven nights; but if you will
reckon by days Artificial, then if you take a part of the day wherein the first
Miracle was wrought, and a part of the day in which Christ was Transfigured,
then it was eight days, but still it was but seven nights.

In like sort, it was eight days from Christ's first appearing to his next
appearing, as John speaks, if you count a part of the former, and a part of
the latter day into the number, but if you account it by nights, then it was no
more but seven nights; so that after a sort it was eight days, but yet in true
account of days natural, which is according to the account of the days of the
week, it was no more but seven nights. This Interpretation and Reconciliation
has the approbation of diverse learned Divines, both Ancient and Modern, and
none will oppose it but peevish persons that love to seek a knot in a Bulrush.

3 A third Reason that does persuade me that Christ has ordained Reason 3.
his Resurrection-day, as the day of his public worship in the place of the
seventh day, is this, namely, because he made choice of the first day of the
week, in which he did send the promise of the Father unto his Disciples, Luke
24. 49. Joh. 15. 26. Luke 24* 49.
Act. 1. 4. Act. 2. 33. For when the day of Pen^icost was come (they being all
as one together) there appeared unto them cloven Tongues like fire, and it sa^e
upon each of them, Act. 2. 1. This day of Penticost was the first day of the
week, in which he arose from the dead, as it may be calculated by the account
of fifty days which must take their beginning from the second Sabbath* that is
to say from the* second day of the Feast of Unleavened-bread (or from the
morrow after the first Festival day, Lev. 23. 15, 16.) to the day of Penticost*
Lev. 23. 15, 16. Act. 2. 1.
so named of fifty days, Act. 2. 1. In the first Festival Sabbath Christ was
crucified, the morrow after was the Sabbath, o^ seventh day, in which he lay in
his grave; thence begins the reckoning to the day of Penticost.

Object. It may be objected, that Christ appeared with the promise of the
Father to his Apostles on this day, because it was the Festival day of
Penticost, rather than because it was the first day of the week.

Ans. I answer, That Christ had abolished the Command for the use of all
Festival Sabbaths by his death, and therefore his appearing now was not in
honor of that Festival Sabbath, but it was purposely because this day was the
first day of the week i^ which he arose as a Lord and Conqueror of Satan's
Head-plo^* and because he had now ordained it as the day* of his public
worship in the place of the seventh day, and in that respect also he made
choice of this day to gift them with the immediate gift of Tongues, for the
more speedy spreading of the Gospel all the world over, on the first day of the
week, as the constant standing day of his public worship.

I conclude therefore, that the same wonderful providence that did order the
Resurrection of Christ to fall out upon the first day of the week, did order
the day of Penticost to fall out at this time on the first day of the week.

And by this Miracle of fiery cloven tong^es on this day, Christ did not only
testify that it was he that gave the Fiery Law at first, when he sounded out
the Law in fire at Mount Sinai (which time has ever since been called
Penticost) for the instruction of his people in faith and holiness, but also
that it was he that would sound out his Law of the glad tidings of the Gospel
to all Nations, by this new gift of fiery tongues which he bestowed upon his
Apostles whilst they were in a Church Assembly, for the more effectual, and
more speedy spreading of the Gospel in all Christian Churches in every first
day of the week; and as an earnest thereof there were three thousand souls
converted at this meeting.

4 A fourth Reason that does persuade me that Christ himself Reason 4.
has ordained his Resurrection-day for the day of his public Worship in the
place of the seventh day, is this, namely because the Apostle did cause the
Christian Churches of Corinth to assemble together on this first day of the
week, 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2. 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2*


The Apostle Paul did not now by this Epistle first begin to appoint this
Church to meet together every first day of the week; for he says, Upon the
first day of the week when ye are met together, (namely according to your usual
custom) Let every one of you lay by him in store as God has prospered him,
that there may be no gathering when I come, 1 Cor. 16. 2.

Hence it is evident, that the first day of the week, when Christians met
together, (or as the Apostles phrase is, when they are met, namely, according
to their usual and constant custom) to worship God, then he did exhort them to
lay aside something for the poor, for that day was a good day for their souls,
and therefore that season was a good season to lay aside something for the poor
Saints that were at Jerusalem.

I grant that the word, Every first day, is not fully expressed in the Greek
Text, but yet it must necessarily be understood, as it appears by the
consequence, for the Apostle did glory of their willing mind to them of
Ma^edonia, saying, that Achaia (in which Country the City of Corinth was
seated) was prepared A year ago* and that their zeal provoked many, 2 Cor. 9.
2. But how could the 2 Cor. 9. 2.
Apostle have thus gloried of their zeal, and of their willing mind to them of
Macedonia, if they had laid up something but once only upon some one first day
of the week, and no more? (as some would have the Text to speak) doubtless
therefore they did lay aside something, either every first day of the week (or
at least usually) when they were met together for the exercise of Gods worship,
and in so doing, their zeal was exemplary to provoke them of Macedonia to
imitate their example; and this is the rather to be believed, because the
Apostle does still exhort them to perform that duty, 2 Cor. 8. 10, 11, 12.

I conclude therefore, that though the word Every be not fully expressed in the
Greek Text, yet that it must necessarily be understood, and therefore the
Geneva Translation that puts it in, is to be justified, because it is according
to the true sense of the place.

2 Touching this phrase, Let every one of you lay by him in store, I dare not
affirm that this is meant of laying up by the Deacons Collection, but I rather
think it was done by separating something by way of Vow for the use of the said
poor in every ones own hand, (which was as sure a course, as if it had been put
into the Box of the poor) for in this phrase [ Let every one of you lay by him
in store.] The Apostle does Thalmudize, as relating therein to a certain
custom of the Jews in vowing something to the poor; for the Hebrew Doctors
say, That Alms is comprehended in the general of Vows; and therefore he that
says thus, Lo this Shekel (or this Shilling) is an Alms, he is bound to give
it to the poor out of hand; But if there be no poor present, he is bound to
separate it, and to lay it Up till he find some poor. See Ains. in Deuteronomy. 23 21.
The Apost^e Paul did lay this duty of Vowing upon the Churches of Galatia,
Corinth and Macedonia, namely, That every one of them should separate something
for the poor, and lay it up on the first day of the week when they were met
together, for that day was a fitter day for that duty, than any other day of
the week: And the Hebrew Doctors do add this to their former speech, That if a
man had purposed (to give such a quantity to the poor) but in his heart only,
he was bound to pay it.

3 Hence it is evident, That the first day of the week, was by Christ's
Institution the day of public Worship in place of the seventh day, or else the
Apostle would never have given direction to the Churches to separate something
for the poor when they were met together on that day, for the Apostle does
profess that in such matters he ordained nothing in the Church, but what he
received from the Lord, 1 Cor. 11. 23. And that the things which he wrote unto
them were the Commandments of the Lord, 1 Cor. 14. 37. and therefore it
follows, that the Church of Corinth and 1 Cor. 11. 23.
all other Christian Churches did usually meet together on this day by the
special Command of Jesus Christ; And seeing the Churches of Macedonia did
contribute to the poor Saints of Jerusalem, as well as the Churches of Achaia,
no doubt but Paul did order them to do it on every first day of the week,
answerable to the Romans 15. 25, 26*
Churches of Galatia and Achaia, Romans 15. 25, 26, 27.

And seeing Paul did observe the first day of the week to administer Act. 20. 7*
the Lords Supper to the Church at Troas in Phrigia, Act. 20. 7. It does
evidence that he was uniform in ordering all Christian Assemblies to be kept on
that day, for Troas was a neighbor Church to them of Galatia, and therefore
they kept the same day for Gods public worship as they of Galatia and Achaia
did, Act. 16. 6* with Act. 18. 27.

5 A fi^th Reason that does persuade me, that Christ himself Reason 5.
has ordained his Resurrection-day for the day of his public worship in the
place of the seventh day, is the hot contention that many believing Jews did
make in Christian Churches about the observation of the Jewish Sabbath, for
many of the believing Jews were still zealous for the observation of Moses
Laws, and this contention of theirs does strongly persuade me that all
Christian Churches had laid aside the observation of the Jewish Sabbath, and
that they did now observe the first day of the week in the place of it, as I
shall more fully explain the matter in Chap. 15.

My sixth Reason, is taken from the title of the Lords day in Reason 6.
Rev. 1. 10. This title is an evident proof to all men that Jesus Christ
himself did ordain the day of his Resurrection in the place of the seventh day;
for John in his Epistle to the seven Churches of Asia, does name it the Lords
day, as if it were a day that was familiarly known to the said Churches, though
they were many miles distant from each other.

But if it had been a new title of a new day, not yet familiarly known to them,
John would have described it to them by some circumstantial demonstration, but
in as much as he does no more but barely name it the Lords day, without any
further description of it, It argues that this day (by this time at least) was
familiarly known, and grown into frequent use and practice among all the
Christian Churches of Asia (for at this time John wrote to the seven Churches
of Asia, in the reign of Domitian the Emperor, which was about four and fifty
years after the death of Christ) by this time I say, the name of the Lords day
was familiarly known among all the Churches of Asia, even as the first day of
the week was familiarly known long before this to the Churches of Achaia,
Galatia, Phrigia, and Macedonia; and doubtless as these parts of the world, so
many others did know that Christ Jesus had ordained the first day of the week
for his public worship in the place of the seventh day.

And truly John might well call it the Lords day in a double respect.

1 In relation to the day of his Resurrection, because in it he arose from the
dead as the Lord and Conqueror of Satan's Headplot, Romans 149.

2 Because He as the Lord of his Church, and as the Lord of the Sabbath, did
ordain this day, to be the day of his Public Worship in the place of the
seventh day, to the end of the world.

And in both these senses David might well say, This is the day Psalm. 118. 24.
which the Lord has made, let us be glad and rejoice in it, Psalm. 118. 24. The
Builders, the Scribes and the Pharisees, put christ to death as an outcast
Malefactor; But this stone which the Builders resused, is become the head of
the corner; for by his Resurrection he is become the Lord and Conqueror of
Satan's Head-plot, Now this is the day that the Lord has made, let us be glad
and rejoice in it. Compare with this Psalm, our Saviors Exposition in Mat. 21.

3 Why should not the title of the Lords day, be as good an evidence that
Christ was the Institutor of it in the place of the seventh day, as the title
of the Lords Supper is, That Christ was the Institutor of it in the place of
the Passover?

A seventh Reason that does persuade me that Christ himself Reason 7.
has ordained his Resurrection-day in the place of the seventh day, is,
because God had determined beforehand (as it appears by the Predictions of the
Old Testament) that he would in the days of the Gospel sanctify some standing
day for his public worship in the place of the seventh day.

1 It was Prophesied that in the days of Christ, his people should come
willingly at the time of assembling in holy beauty, Psalm. 110. 3. I think none
will deny these words to be uttered as a Psalm. 110. 3.
plain Prophecy that the Christians of the New Testament must observe a
certain day for the exercise of Gods public worship in the place of the
seventh day, and of all their other Sabbaths.

2 God calls the Worship of the New Testament by the name of the Sabbath, Es.
56. 2, 4, 6. implying thereby, that we Christians Es. 56. 2. 4. 6.
shall not only have a certain form of outward worship according to the second
Commandment, but also that we shall have a certain known day for the exercise
of the said worship according to the fourth Commandment.

3 It is Prophesied that Christians shall have more Sacrifices in their
Sabbath, than the Jews had under Moses Law, Ez^k. 46. 4, 5. Ezekiel. 46.4, 5.
compared with Numb. 29. 9, 10. This mystical speech does imply, First, that
Christians shall observe a certain form of public worship: And secondly, that
they shall observe a certain day for the exercise of that public worship.

And truly it argues to me that God has given over such men to a senseless
mind, that though they are forced to grant that Christ has ordained a certain
form of public worship, yet do deny that Christ has ordained a certain day
for the exercise of that public worship: I cannot see how they can be
separated, without apparent hazard of barbarous confusion to Gods public
worship.

4 It is Prophesied that the peoples shall be gathered together, and the
Kingdoms, to serve the Lord, Psalm. 102. 22. And that from month to month, and
from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me says the
Lord, Es. 66. 23. Es. 66. 230.


These Scriptures do plainly teach us these two Doctrines.

1 The utter abrogating of all Moses typical worship in the days of Christ,
because it is not possible for all Peoples, and Nations to come to Jerusalem
from month to month, and from Sabbath to Sabbath, to worship before the Lord
there.

2 These words imply, that the Christians of the New Testament shall be very
active in Gods worship, and in the observing of some known public day for the
exercise thereof.

An eighth Reason that does much persuade me that Christ has Reason 8.
ordained his Resurrection-day, for the day of his public worship in the place
of the seventh day, is taken from the Mystical number Eight; for the day of
Christ's Resurrection in a continued reckoning of days, is the Eighth day; For
he rested all the seventh day in his Grave; and the next day being the Eighth
day in order of days, he arose as an absolute Conqueror, and the Mystical
number of Eight is a day of perfection in the Law, and therefore a fit type of
the perfection of Christ by his Resurrection on the Eighth day.

1 No creature by the Levitical Law was allowable for sacrifice Reason 1. Lev.
22. 27. Exodus 22. 30.
until it was eight days old, Lev. 22. 27. Exodus 22. 30.

I cannot but wonder why the Lord did refuse it as seven days old, seeing the
seventh day was the day of Gods perfect rest from all his works, for then he
rested in Christ that had made all perfect again after Adams fall by his
Propitiatory Sacrifice of Atonement.

But when I consider again that his Propitiatory Sacrifice was not evident to
be perfect until he rose again from the dead, as the Lord and alone Conqueror
of Satan's Head-plot on the first day of the week, which day is also called the
Eighth day by John, Joh. 20. 26.
Joh. 20. 26.

I say by this consideration, my wondering is staid, and I do rather wonder at
Gods wise Providence that would not accept any young beast as a perfect beast
for Sacrifice until the eighth day, doubtless it was in relation to the
manifestation of the perfection of Christ his Sacrifice by his Resurrection on
the eighth day. For though the number seven be a perfect number in some
respects, yet in other respects, the number eight is a more perfect number.

The Youngling must continue under the Dam seven days; during which space of
time the Hebrew Doctors did call it Lacking Time, because in that space it was
not perfect for Sacrifice, Although the Sabbath had passed over the head of it;
But on the eighth day it was accounted perfect, and then, and not till then, it
was accepted in Sacrifice. Therefore in the case of Sacrifices of Atonement
the number seven was not so perfect as the number eighth; And what can this
degree of perfection on the eighth day resemble fitter than the manifestation
of the perfection of Christ's propitiatory Sacrifice by his Resurrection on the
eighth day: And truly, if he had not risen from death to life the next day
after the seventh day, his Sacrifice of Atonement by his death had been lost
and vain, 1 Cor. 15. 17. And answerable to the said eighth day, John does call
the day of Christ his Resurrection, the eighth day, Joh. 20. 26. The Providence
of God so guiding his Pen, as pointing out unto us backward, to the perfection
of the mystical number eight in Moses Law.

My second Reason why the number eight did typisie the day Reason 2.
of Christ's Resurrection, as more eminent than the seventh day, is taken from
the Law of Circumcision which was so strictly tied to the eighth day, that
though the eighth day did fall out upon the Sabbath day, yet they must prefer
the doing of the act of Circumcision, because it was the eighth day, rather
than the act of rest, because it was the seventh day, Joh. 7. 22. And the
Hebrew Doctors do affirm that Circumcision in the time thereof Joh. 7. 22.
drives away the Sabbath; that is to say, A man must omit to keep the rest of
the Holy Sabbath to circumcise his child on the eighth day; if the Sabbath be
the eighth day, seven days together the young Infant was in his blood of
uncleanness, but on the eighth day it must be circumcised for the full
cleansing of it from all the pollution that did accompany it in the birth.

And Rab. Menachem on Genesis 17. says, Circumcision was therefore done on the
eigth day, that the Sabbath might pass over it, for there is no eighth day
without a Sabbath; and then as soon as it was circumcised, it was accounted as
a new creature, as if it were risen again from death to life, and this did
typifie our first resurrection from the death of sin, to the life of grace, by
virtue of Christa Resurrection, whose Resurrection-day is called the eighth
day, as I have ere-while noted from Joh. 20. 26.

A third Reason is taken from the consecration of the Priests, Reason 3.
their persons were not perfectly consecrated to minister in their office
until the eighth day, Lev. 8. 33. 35. Lev. 9. 1. Ezekiel. 43. Lev. 8. 33. 45.
26, 27. In like sort, the Person and Sacrifice of the Mediator was not
declared to be fully accepted until his Resurrection on the eighth day.

A fourth Reason is taken from the perfect cleansing of the Reason 4.
Leper on the eighth day, Lev. 14. 8, 9, 10. And from the cleansing Lev. 15.
13, 14.
of unclean Issues, Lev. 15. 13, 14. And from the cleansing of the polluted
Nazarite, Number. 6. 9, 10. And from sundry such like Instances, where no perfect
cleansing was made until the eighth day; then, and not till then, their
persons and sacrifices were acceptable unto God, as persons that were newly
risen from death to life; doubtless this full acceptance of them and of their
Sacrifices on the 8th day, did typifie the full acceptance of Christ's Person,
and Sacrifice, which was declared by his Resurrection on the eighth day, for he
rose from the dead on the next day after the seventh day.

A fifth Reason is taken from that special eighth day of the Feast Reas. 5.
of Tabernacles which was called also a Sabbath day: This day was called the
last day of the Feast of Tabernacles; and it had a Commandment by it self
above the other seven days, because it was a greater Sabbath than any of the
rest, and in that respect John does call it the great and last day of the
Feast, Joh. 7. 37. Joh 7. 37.
And all the Tribes of Israel were bound to observe this day with a general
Assembly above the other seven days, Deuteronomy. 31. 10, 11. 2 Chr. 7. 9. Neh. 8.
18. And that Assembly is called a General Assembly Neh. 8. 18.
by the Seventy, in Amos 5. 21. And by allusion to that term the Apostle Paul
calls all the Israel of God, The General Assembly of the firstborn, Heb. 12.
23. Amos 5. 21. Heb. 12. 23.


And why was this eighth day made more eminent than all the other seven days?
but to type out unto us the eminency of the Resurrection-day of Christ above
the seventh day for the exercise of Gods public worship to the worlds end; and
the New Testament does tell us of a great number of Christians that were
gathered into a great Church Assembly on this day at Jerusalem Act. 2. 41. And
this great Assembly was from diverse parts, and quarters of the world, for many
of the dispersed Jews that did believe, resorted to Jerusalem from remote
Countries at Festival times, and many that were converted to the faith did
there continue, until they were dispersed again at the death of Stephen, which
dispersion God turned to the further enlargement of his Church for many of
these dispersed Disciples preached the Gospel in sundry parts of the world
where they traveled, and by that means a multitude, both of Jews and Heathens,
became Christians, and these Christians, in time made many Christian
Church Assemblies, and they all used to meet together on the first day of the
week, which was the next day after the seventh, and so it was the eighth day,
which was typified by the eighth and last day of the Feast of Tabernacles.

A sixth Reason is borrowed from the Jubilee Year which by Reason 6.
Gods special Providence was ordained to be in the eighth year after the
seventh seven, and this sabbatical year was ordained to be a greater Sabbath
than the seventh seven, because it was ordained to give a more full deliverance
to Gods people than the seventh seven, Lev. 25. 4, 8, 20. Lev. 25. 4.


The seventh seven was the forty and ninth year, and the next year after the
seventh seven was the eighth year, and it was also the fiftieth year, or the
Jubilee year.

And both these Sabbatical years thus succeeding each other do most lively
point out unto us, how the Lords Resurrection-day (by which we have a full
J^bilee of deliverance from Satan's Head-plot) should succeed the Sabbath, or
seventh day.

Three things are remarkable touching the number Eight. 1 That the number Eight
was mystical as well as the number Seven. 2 That the number Eight was a number
of perfection as well as the number Seven. 3 That the number Eight was a
Sabbatical number as well as the number Seven.


Now seeing these things have been made clear, and cannot be denied, how can it
be denied, but that the number eight must needs have relation not only to the
Resurrection of Christ on the eighth day (that is to say on the next day after
the seventh day) but also that the said day must be established as a Sabbatical
day among Christians in the New Testament in the place of the seventh day?

II It is no less wonderful that four Sabbaths did meet together and succeed
each other at the death and Resurrection of Christ.

1 Christ did make his soul a P^op^^^atory Sacrifice of Atonement for our full
Redemption from Satan's Head* plot on a Festival Sabbath (namely on the first
day of the Feast of Unleavened-bread) and this day John calls a High Sabbath,
Joh. Joh. 19. 31.
19. 31.

2 Christ rested all the Sabbath or seventh day, namely, his body rested in his
grave, and his soul in Paradise.

3 On the first* day of the week he ^rose again from the dead as the Lord and
Conqueror of Satan's Head-plot; and in this respect, he being the Lord of his
Church, and the Lord of the Sabbath, did ordain it for the day of his public
worship in place of the seventh day to the end of the world.

4 God by his eternal Counsel ordained, and Christ in obedience to his Fathers
will accomplished his Death and Resurrection in a Sabbatical Year of Jubilee.

And this Sabbatical Jubilee is also called, The acceptable Year of the Lord,
Luke 4. 19. And from the typical signification of the Luke 4. 19.
Jubilee-deliverance, the Hebrew Doctors did foresee and foresay, to the
admiration of con^iderate Christians, That the Divine Majesty would be to
Israel in a Jubilee, Freedom, Redemption, and Finisher of Sabbaths. See Zehar
on Lev. 25. Col. 2. 10. fol. 53. And to admiration also Kimchi upon Ezekiel 40.
says, That the Messiah Redeems in a Jubilee. See H. Bro. in Req. p. 13. and in
Sinai-sight, Year of the World, 2560.

III Who can but admire also at the wonderful Providence of God, 3 The
Resurrection of Christ fell out so, that it was made famous by three remarkable
days.
that the day of Christ's Resurrection should fall out so, as that it should be
remarkable by three famous days?

1 It fell out upon the first day of the week.

2 It fell out upon the eighth day.

3 It fell out upon the third day.

1 Christ's Resurrection fell out upon the first day of the week wherein God
created light out of darkn^sse, and on that day Christ did arise out of his
darksome grave to give light to the world, Joh. 1. 9. Joh. 8 12. and so he made
that day which was first in order in the Creation, to be first in dignity by
the work of his Resurrection; he made that day which was the first fruits of
time, to be the first fruits from the dead, 1 Cor. 15. Col. 1. 16.

2 Christ's Resurrection fell out upon the eighth day, namely, on the next day
after the seventh day, which is the eighth day, the eighth day was ordained by
Moses Law, to be a day of perfection, above the perfection of the number seven,
which I have noted, might well be to typifie the day of Christ's Resurrection to
come in the place of the seventh day.

3 Christ's Resurrection fell out on the third day after his death, and so
Christ opened and alleged from the Scriptures that he must rise again from the
dead on the third day, Luke 24. 45, 46. and doubtless the Resurrection of
Isaac on the third day, was a rare type of the Resurrection of Christ upon the
third day, for Isaac is said to have been offered, Jam. 2. 21. and to have been
raised Jam. 2. 21.
up again from the dead after a sort on the third day, Heb. 11. 19. for it was
the third day from their coming out to sacrifice, Heb. 11. 19.
when he and his Father Abraham came to the place of performance, and from that
action the Hebrew Doctors do gather that the third day is mysterious in
Scripture. There are many a three days say they in Scripture, of which one is
the Resurrection of the Messiah. See Ains. in Genesis 22. 4. See also H. Bro. in
his Reduction in Genesis 22. 4.
Dan. 9. and Christ himself did fore-tel that On the third day he should be
perfected, Luke 13. 32. his meaning must needs be that Mediatorial Luke 13. 32.
Sacrifice of Atonement should be declared to be perfect by his Resurrection
on the third day.

Conclusion.
From all the Premises it appears, that the day of Christ's Resurrection, was
the most glorious day that God had honored, and the most glorious day that
could be thought on among true Christians, and therefore it may persuade our
consciences, that if Christ has ordained any day for his public Worship in
the place of the seventh day, it must needs be that day of perfection, wherein
he arose as Lord and Conqueror of Satan's Head-plot, and therefore the
observation of it ought to be honored of all good Christians for evermore.

Amen.
CHAP. XV.
Propounding some Reasons why the Apostles did allow of the Jewish Sabbath, or
seventh day, in their Synagogues, for a time after it was abolished by the
death of Christ, as well as of the Lords Day in Christian Churches.

THe Apostles knew well enough that Christ had ordained his Resurrection-day as
the day of his public Worship, in place of the seventh day, and therefore in
that respect they appointed all Christian Churches to observe that day for Gods
public Worship, and yet notwithstanding they still resorted to Gods public
Worship on the seventh day in the Jews Synagogues, for a certain space of years
after the death of Christ; I say, for some space of time the Apostles did allow
by way of permission the use of the Sabbath, or seventh day, yea they did allow
of the use of Sacrifices also in the Temple for a time, for they knew that as
long as Christ was willing to suffer the Temple to stand undestroyed, that he
was willing to suffer and permit the use of Sacrifices and Sabbaths, and
therefore for the weakness sake of many believing Jews, that did as yet remain
in their old Synagogues, the Apostles did see it convenient to allow of the use
of the seventh day for Gods public Worship in their Synagogues, according to
their ancient known custom; yea moreover the Apostles did see it convenient to
allow of the use of Circumcision, and of all the other Customs of Moses also
for a time, for the weakness sake of many ten thousand Jews that did believe
in Christ, because that many of these believing Jews did still continue to be
zealous assertors of the customs of Moses Law, Act. 21. 20. for many of these
believing Jews were Acts 21. 20
not only eminent for faith in Christ, but also they were eminent for zeal in
Moses Law, as we may see in the example of Ananias that opened Paul's eyes; It
is recorded of him, that he was a godly man, as pertaining to the Law, Act. 22.
12, and it is also recorded, that there were diverse other Jews that did believe
in Christ, and yet they still continued zealous not only for Circumcision, but
also for all the other customs of Moses, Act. 15. 5. Act. 15. 5. 24
and it was for the sake of these believing Jews that as yet remained in
Synagogues, that the Apostles did by way of permission allow of the use of the
Sabbath day in their Synagogues till a convenient time of Reformation.

And out of this consideration it was that the Apostles in their Decrees at
Jerusalem, did not absolutely forbid the use of Circumcision, Acts 15. and out
of this consideration it was, that Paul took liberty to Circumcise Timothy,
that so he might thereby win the affection of the said Synagogues where some
believing Jews were, to his person and Ministry, Act. 16. 3. Acts 16. 3


Yea a long space after the death of Christ, he did by the advice of the
Apostle James take upon him to be a Consort with four men, that took upon them
a Levitical vow, namely, the Nazarites Vow; and Paul did well-nigh observe all
the days of Purification according to the custom of Moses Law; and he was also
ready prepared to pay his part and share of their Sacrifice to be See Ainsw. in
Numb. 6, 18
offered in the Temple, had not the Malignant Jews hindered him, by
apprehending his Person, in a sudden rage against him for polluting the holy
Temple, as they surmised, Act. 21. 24. And for Acts 21. 24
this very reason the Apostles made no scruple at all to preach on the Sabbath,
or seventh day, in the Jews Synagogues, for in the Synagogues the Jews observed
no other day but the seventh day, as it is evident by Acts 13. Acts 16. Acts
17. Acts 18, etc. The Apostles therefore made no scruple, but did gladly take
the opportunity of their old Sabbath, to preach unto them in their Synagogues,
by the means whereof they converted many ten thousand Jews unto Christ; and
after conversion the Apostles left them to continue still in their
Synagogue-Assemblies, until the malignant Jews did persecute them, and then
the Apostles did advise them to separate from the Synagogue, and so to join
themselves into particular Christian Churches, where they were directed to
observe the Lords Day in the place of the Jewish Sabbath, for in those Heathen
Countries where Paul preached in the Jews Synagogues, the Heathen Governors
(by Gods special providence) left the Jews to the free liberty of their own
Consciences, to use what Worship, and what day of Worship they pleased, and in
that respect the Christians had as much liberty to observe the Lords Day in
their Church Assemblies, as the Jews had to observe their Sabbath in their
Synagogues; and therefore as soon as the believing Jews and Proselites of
Thessalonica were persecuted by the malignant Synagogue, they joined into a
Christian Church-Assembly by themselves, Acts 17. 4. and so Acts 17. 4 Acts 18.
17 Acts 19. 9
the believing Jews and Proselites of the Synagogue of Corinth did the like as
soon as they were persecuted, Act. 18. 17. and the Christian Jews and
Proselites of Ephesus did the like, Act. 19. 9. These, and all the other
believing Jews of the other Synagogues, did separate themselves from the
malignant Synagogue as soon as they were persecuted, and joined themselves into
several Christian Churches, and then they kept their Church-meetings on the
Lords Day, and not on the Sabbath Day; for the Apostles did open and allege
unto them, that the Jewish Sabbath was abolished by the death of Christ, and
that Christ had instituted his Resurrection-day in the place of it, for the day
of his public Worship.

Obj. Here it may be demanded, How can it be proved, that the Apostles did
instruct the believing Jews and Proselites in the observation of the Lords Day.

Ans. It is evident enough by the opposition which some of The opposition which
some of the believing Jews made in Christian Churches or their not observing of
the Jewish S^bbath *does fully p^ove, that the Christian Church had c^st off
the Jewish S^bba^h* and that they observed the Lords Day in the place of it.
the said believing Jews did make against the Apostles, and the Christian
Churches, for the not observing of the Jewish Sabbath, for it is evident that
many of the said believing Jews did still earnestly contend, not only for the
observation of the Jewish Sabbath, but also for the observation of all the
other customs of Moses; but if the said Christian Churches had not altered the
day of their public Worship, the said believing Jews had not had any occasion
at all to contend for the observation of their wonted Sabbath Day; therefore by
their earnest contending for the observation of the Jewish Sabbath, it appears,
That the Christian Churches did by the Apostles directions observe the Lords
Day for Gods public Worship; I say, the earnest contention that some certain
Jews which did believe, did make against the Christian Churches for their not
observing of the Jewish Sabbath, does fully prove to my understanding, that the
said Christian Churches h^d laid aside the use of the Jewish Sabbath, and did
make use of the Lords Day only for the use of Gods public Worshi^* a^ I shall
explain i^ by and by.

B^^ y^^ I have also affirmed* that the Apostles did allow of the observation
of the Jewish Sabbath in the Jews Synagogues, and that they did gladly embrace
the opportunity of that day, to preach unto them for their conversion to the
faith of Christ.

And so for a time the Apostles did observe two Sabbaths together, namely, the
Jewish Sabbaths, in preaching to them in their Synagogues, and the Lords Day,
in preaching to the converted Jews and Proselites in their Christian assemblies.

And this their practice was as allowable for a time as John's Baptism was with
Circumcision for a time; for Apelles was Baptized with the Baptism of John
after he had been Circumcised, Acts 19. 3. and Christ himself was Baptized of
John in Jordan after he had been Circumcised; yea which is more, it was after
that Christ had ordained John's Baptism, as a Sacrament of ini^iation into the
Christian Church; and Paul did Circumcise Timothy, who doubtless had been
formerly Baptized into the Church of Christ.

Obj. Why did the Apostle Paul circumcise Timothy, seeing he had formerly been
baptized into the Church of Christ?

Ans. Doubtless he did not Circumcise Timothy out of any Conscience to the
necessary use of Circumcision, as the Jews Synagogues did, but because Paul and
Timothy were to be conversant in the Synagogues, where they observed the
Sabbath, and Circumcision, therefore Paul did it merely out of Christian Wisdom
and Providence, that he might thereby win the Jews the more to respect his
Person and Ministry, Act. 16. 3. for Paul desired to be conversant in the Jews
Synagogues as much as might be, but he knew he could not be admitted to
converse with them in their Synagogue* Worship, having Timothy an uncircumcised
Grecian for his companion, unless he was Circumcised, for uncircumcised
Persons might not be admitted to ^amiliar converse with them in the exercise of
Religion, Acts 10. 28.

Therefore seeing the Apostles saw cause to allow of the use of Circumcision by
way of permission for a time, after that Christ had ordained Baptism, as the
only Sacrament of initiation into his Church, they might by the same reason
allow of the Jewish Sabbath in their Synagogues, though not in their Christian
Churches, no more than they might allow of the use of Circumcision in their
Christian Churches, for Paul would not C^rcomcise Titus to please some zealous
Jews in the Christian Church, though he did Circumcise Timothy for the
Synagogues sake, Gal. 2. 3, 4. And in this respect (though the observation of
the Sabbath was fully ended virtually by the Death of Christ, and not permitted
in the Christian Churches, yet) Christ was pleased to permit the use of it to
his Apostles in the I^ws Synagogue^ for a time, namely, as long as they had
opportunity to preach to the Jews in their Synagogues, and in that respect it
pleased Christ Jesus to bless the preaching of the Apostles and Disciples in
their Synagogues upon their Sabbath Day, to the conversion of many thousand
Jews, though many of them after their conversion did still continue ze^lous for
the Law, even after separation Acts 21. 20 Acts 15. 5. 24. Jam. 1. 1
into Christian Churches, Acts 21. 20. Acts 15. 5. 24. Jam. 1. 1. 1 Pet. 1. 1.
and their zeal to Moses Law, they did witness to all men, in that many of them
did still resort to Jerusalem, to observe the festival Sabbaths, as some of
them did in Acts 2. 5. and in this respect it was that Paul in relation to the
Synagogue chiefly did tender their weak Consciences, saying, To the Jews I
became a Jew, that I might win the Jews, and to them that were under the Law as
though I were under the Law, 1 Cor. 9. 20. but in 1 Cor. 9. 20 Gal. 2. 5
the Christian Churches Paul would not allow of any Jewish customs, Gal. 2. 5.

Now this practice of the Apostles in observing the Jewish Sabbath for a time
in their Synagogues* does no more dis-approve the changing of the Sabbath into
the Lords Day, than it dis-approves the changing of Circumcision into Baptism;
for after that Christ had ordained the Sacrament of Baptism as one of the Seals
of the New Covenant, the Apostles did still allow of the practice of
Circumcision (namely in relation to their Synagogues, but not in relation to
Christian Churches) and of all the other customs of Moses also by way of
permission, for a time.

But as soon as the Apostles did but once perceive that many of the said
believing Jews grew stiff and sturdy, for the observation of Moses Ceremonies
in Christian Churches, much like unto the malignant Jews in the Synagogues,
then Paul and the other Apostles also grew resolute to oppose the practice, not
only of Circumcision in the Christian Churches, but of the use of the Sabbath,
and of all the other customs of Moses also, Gal. 2. 5. and thereupon many
believing Jews did oppos^ Paul, but yet the other Jews of the malignant
Synagogues did hate Paul much more for his D^ctrin, for they sought opportunity
to lay hands on him that they might put him to death, and therefore they
accused him to Felix, saying, Certai^ly we have found this man a pestilent
fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the World, and a
chief maintainer of the Sect of the Nazarites, Acts 24. 5. Acts 24. 5


In like sort Stephens Accusers testified against him, saying, that he had
affirmed, That Jesus of Nazaret should destroy their holy place, and change the
customs of Moses, Act. 6. 14. And when Paul came Acts 6. 14
to Rome, the Jews told him there, That this Sect was every where spoken
against, Acts 28. 22. and when Paul came to Jerusalem, Acts 28. 22
James told him, That the Jews were informed that he taught the Jews which
were among the Gentiles, namely the Christian Churches, that they should
forsake Moses, and not live after the customs, Acts 21. 21. and the Jews of
Asia said, This Act. 21. 21, 28
man teaches all men every where against the People, and the Law, and this
place, Acts 21. 28. By these, and such like testimonies it is evident, that
Paul did mightily cry down the observation of all Moses customs in all
Christian Churches.

And this is further evident also by Paul's downright reproofs to the Churches
of Galatia, Gal. 2. 3, etc. Gal. 3. 1. etc. Gal. 4. 9, etc. Gal. 5. 1, 2. but
especially mark the manner of his phrase in his reproof in Gal. 4. 9, 10, 11.
There he calls all the customs Gal 4. 9, 10, 11
of Moses but weak, and poor rudiments, whereunto as from the beginning ye
will be in bondage again (as from the beginning of your conversion, when you
lived in the Synagogues) Ye observe days, and months, and times, an^ years, I
am in fear of you* lest I have bestowed on you labor in vain. The Apostle by
four Phrases does enumerate all the solemn Holy Days that were commanded by
Moses, the observation of all which he opposes in Christian Churches.

1 Ye observe days; by Days he means, That some of the believing Jews among
them had persuaded the Churches of Galati^ to observe their old weekly Sabbath*
Days for the exercise of their public Worship.

2 By Months he means, That some of the believing Jews among them had persuaded
them to make conscience in observing the first day of every new Moon for the
public Worship of God.

3 By Times he means, That they contended for the observation of the three
solemn Festival Sabbaths, by resorting if they could to Jerusalem, where those
three Festival Sabbaths were to be observed. And,

4 By Years he means, That they contended for the observation of that solemn
Fasting-day, called the day of Atonement, which always fell out upon the tenth
day of the seventh Month. These were all the set Days, and solemn Times which
were commanded in Moses Law, in Levi^. 23.

I do not mean that the said believing Jews did contend for the observation of
the two last* named Sabbaths, by offering sacrifices upon the days appointed by
Moses, in their Christian Churches, for all the Jews in general did hold it
utterly unlawful, yea they held it to be death to offer any sacrifice after the
Temple was built, in any Synagogue, or in any other place save in the Temple it
self.

But my meaning is, That the said believing Jews did contend for the
observation of the two first sorts of days in their Christian Churches, as the
only lawful and commanded day^ for Gods public Worship; for the manner of the
Jews was to observe every Acts 15. 21
seventh day in their Synagogues, Acts 15. 21. and their manner was to observe
every first day of their New Moons, not only at the Temple, but also in their
Synagogues, and places of public Worship, where the Word of God was used to be
preached, 2 King. 4. 23. but the Apostle Paul does oppose the observation of
these days in Christian Churches as much as he does the other, and therefore he
wrote to the dispersed Hebrews, that professed Christianity, that the former
Covenant which stood in the outward observation of Moses ceremonies waxed old,
and was Heb. 8. 13
ready to vanish away, Heb. 8. 13. and also in Heb. 13. 9. He exhorts them, not
to be carried abut with diverse and strange Doctrins, (namely, not to be
carried about to the observation of Moses Ceremonies) for (says he) it is a
good thing that the heart be established with Grace, and not with Meats, which
have not profi^ed them that have been exercised therein; and in chap. 9. 10. he
calls the observation of Meats and Drinks, and diverse Washings, carnal
Ordinances, imposed unto them, until the time of Reformation, which time of
Reformation was already come.

And also he exhorts the Colossians, saying thus; Let no man therefore judge
you in meat or drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the New Moon, ^r of
the Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the Body is Christ,
Col. 2. 16, 17. Col. 2. 16, 17


In these words the Apostle does exhort them, not to let any man to rule over
them as Judges of their Christian liberty, by enforcing and persuading their
Consciences to the observation of Moses ceremonies, seeing they were but
shadows of something to come, namely, they were but shadows of something to be
fulfilled by Christ; for Christ the Body was already come in the place of them
all; yea says the Apostle, Let no man beguile you of your prize, Col. 2. 18* 20
namely, of that precious liberty which Christ by his Death has purchased for
you, from the bondage of Moses ceremonies, v. 18. and then he passes his
sentence against the Authors of their disturbance, saying, They are but
self-willed in humbleness, etc. and then in ve. 20. the Apostles conclude
thus, If ye be dead with Christ from the decrees of the world (if you believe
that Christ by his death has ended decrees) why as though ye lived in the
world (namely in the observation of Moses ceremonies, which were composed but
of worldly things, and in that respect the Sanctuary is called a worldly
Sanctuary, Heb. 9. 1.) Follow ye decrees, etc.

That which I aim at by this discourse is this, namely, to declare, that there
were some believing Jews in the Church of Colosse that did earnestly contend
(not only for the observation of Moses ceremonies in general, but also that did
in particular contend) for the observation of the Jewish Sabbath, as the only
commanded day of Gods public Worship in Christian Churches; and hence I infer,
that these believing Jews needed not to have contended so earnestly for the
observation of the Jewish Sabbath, if the Apostles had not laid the observation
of it aside, and required Christian Churches to observe the Lords Day for their
Christian assemblies, in the place of the seventh day.

Obj. 2. I conceive these believing Jews did not contend for the observation of
the Jewish Sabbath, as you think, but for the observation of the other Festival
Sabbaths; against which only the Apostle does speak.

Ans. 1. If you will grant, That the Apostle does exhort the Church of Colosse
not to submit their Consciences to the observation of their Festival Sabbaths,
then much more does he exhort them not to submit their Consciences to the
observation of their weekly Sabbaths, or seventh day; for the weekly Sabbath
was a typical sign as well as their other Festival Sabbaths, and therefore the
death of Christ does abolish them all alike.

2 And more particularly I answer, That Paul's meaning by the word Sabbaths, in
Col. 2. 16. does not (as I conceive) point out Col. 2. 16
any other Sabbath but the seventh day only; for Paul does enumerate all the
several sorts of their Holy Days under these three several expressions; First,
says he, Let no man judge you in respect of a Holy Day; Secondly, Or of the
New Moon; Thirdly; Or of the Sabbaths.

1 Under the term Holy Day the Apostle does comprehend their three yearly
Holy Day Feasts; for there are no other solemn commanded Holy Days in Moses,
except the New Moon, and the ordinary Sabbath days, and these are not included
in the term Holy Day, because they are distinguished, and sorted out from them
by other distinct terms; neither does the Apostle comprehend any human
Holy Days in this number, such as were sometimes commanded by their Sanedrim
(upon some special occasions) as the days of Purim were, Est. 9. and as the day
of Dedication was, Job. 10. 22. for these temporary Holy Days must Joh. 10. 22
not be Copartners with the said yearly standing Holy Days of Moses; neither
do I think that the Apostle does now forbid the observation of such occasional
temporary Holy Days in Christian Churches; but the Apostle does out of all
doubt dehort them from the observation of their three Festival Holy Days;
therefore by the term Holy Day, which the Apostle distinguishes from the two
other sorts of Holy Days, namely from the New Moon, and from the Sabbath, he
must needs mean no other but the said three yearly Festival Holy Days.

2 By the New Moon the Apostle means the first day of every New Moon, which the
Jews observed in all their Synagogues, as a constant Holy Day for the hearing
of Gods Word preached in all the costs of Israel, Numb. 28. 11. 2 King. 4. 23.

3 Therefore the term Sabbaths must needs mean their weekly Sabbaths, which
some Christian Jews that still remained zealous for the Law, did labor tooth
and nayl to persuade the Church of Colosse to observe for the day of their
public Worship; but the Apostle told them, that all this Bill of Decrees
Christ had wiped away by his death, Col. 2. 14. Col. 2. 14


3 It is yet further evident that these three terms in Col. 2. 16. do fully
comprehend all the Holy Days that are in Moses, because Moses does comprehend
them all in three the like terms in Number. 10. 10. Ye shall sound an Alarm, (1)
In the day of your Gladness; Number. 10. 10.
And (2) In your Solemn Feasts; And (3) In the beginning of your months.

Though these three terms are not placed in the same order that Paul does his
in Col. 2. 16. yet they must needs comprehend all the Ceremonial Sabbaths, or
Holy Days of Moses: For first, by the day of their Gladness, Moses does mean
such a day of gladness, as he does distinguish from their Solemn Feasts, and
from their New Moons; which distinction ought not to be slighted; And
therefore Baal Hattarim understands it of the Sabbath day. And indeed no day
has the pre-eminence of gladness to this day, for it was first ordained to be
a day of rest to God, because he had established Adams happiness, and the
Government of the whole Creation on the Promised Seed, who had undertaken to
break the Devils Head-plot, and therefore he rested in the Mediator, and was
refreshed, and it was a typical sign of fallen man's resting on the Mediator for
his Redemption from Satan's Headplot, and therefore it was the first great day
of gladness to fallen Adam, and therefore as I have formerly noted, the seventh
day is placed among the Festival Sabbaths in the first place, as the chiefest
day of gladness, Lev. 23. 3. Lev. 23. 3.


And indeed no other day can be meant by the day of gladness, but the Sabbath
or seventh day, and the reason is plain, because all the other Holy Days in
Moses are fully comprehended in the other two terms.

4 Solomon in 2 Chronicles. 2. 4. does expound the said three terms, 2 Chronicles. 2. 4.
by showing the solemnity of all the sorts of Holy Days in the Temple-service,
for he built a Temple to the Lord, namely, To burn sweet incense before Him,
and for the continual Shewbread, and for the Burnt-offerings of the morning
and evening, (1) On the Sabbath days. (2) In the New Moons. And (3) In the
Solemn Feasts of the Lord. This is a perpetual thing for Israel. And moreover
the Hebrew Doctors say, That they did blow with the silver Trumpets in the
Sanctuary, (1) Over the Burnt-offerings of the Sabbaths. (2) In the New Moons.
And (3) in the Solemn Feasts.

By these two Scriptures compared together with Col. 2. 16. and with Gal. 4 9,
10, 11. It is evident that all the solemn Holy Days in Moses are comprehended
under the said three terms; And therefore by the term Sabbaths in Col. 2. 16.
as it is distinguished from the New Moon, and a Holy Day, must needs be meant
the weekly Sabbaths only, which some Christian Jews contended to have observed
in their Christian Churches in opposition to the Lords day.

Object. 3. It seems to me that our Savior did not ordain his Resurrection day
in place of the seventh day, because our Savior in Mat. 24. 20. Mat. 24. 20.
does warn his Disciples to pray (at the time of their destruction by the
Romans) that their flight might not be, neither in the Winter, nor upon the
Sabbath day: Now if Christ had abolished the Sabbath by his death, as you
affirm, then he would not have given this caution of praying that their flight
might not be on the Sabbath day, so long after his death, for it was about
forty years after his death ere the City was destroyed by the Romans.

Ans. Christ did not give this caution to his Disciples in the nature of a
Command, or forbidding, but in the nature of a dis-allowing of the Jews
superstitious opinion of the outward rest of the Sabbath, so long after his
death: They might in that space have been better taught and instructed, if they
had not been enemies to the Gospel of Christ, but because they would not be
instructed, therefore our Savior told his Disciples, that the Jews of Judea in
general would hold such a superstitious opinion, both of the holiness of the
Temple, and of the outward rest of the Sabbath day, that it would be a grievous
calamity to them if they were forced to fly for their lives upon the Sabbath
day, more than upon any other day in the week: But yet this must be marked,
that our Savior speaks this to his Disciples, but as a Prophetical Historian,
foretelling them what would be the common opinion of the Nation of the Jews in
those days, namely, that they would be infected with such a superstitious
opinion of the holiness of the outward rest of the Sabbath, that they would
neither stir hand or foot to break the outward rest of the Sabbath by flight to
save their lives. This caution of our Savior to his Disciples must needs be
understood in this sense, because the whole frame of his speech is fetched (by
way of allusion) to a former like sad calamity, which fell upon them under
Antiochus Epiphanes, who did purposely molest them upon the Sabbath day, as
also in the Winter time, and then they suffered extreme miseries by reason of
their superstitious opinion of the outward rest of the Sabbath day, which they
might have prevented, if they had held it lawful at first, as they did at last,
that in case of necessity they might either fight or fly for their lives upon
the Sabbath day.

Our Savior in this his speech to his Disciples does allude to the times of
Antiochus, and therefore he does mention the Winter as well as the Sabbath day,
for Judas Maccabeus did cleanse the Temple and the Altar in the Winter, Joh.
10. 22. and three years before it was polluted in the Winter, 1 Mac. 1. 54. And
secondly, it was also polluted upon the Sabbath day, 1 Mac. 2. 38. and now it
was a time of grievous calamity to the Jews, and therefore by way of allusion
to this calamitous time, our Savior bad them pray. That their flight might
neither be in the Winter, nor yet upon the Sabbath day, for then they would do
as they had done, neither fight nor fly to save their lives. This their blind
zeal our Savior reproves, 1 Mac. 2, 34. 36. 38. 41. and 2 Mac. 6. 11.

It follows therefore by good consequence, that our Savior did not now in
sadness teach his Disciples the continuance of the Sabbath so long after his
death, no more than he taught them the continuance of the service of the
Temple, by calling the Temple The Holy Place, verse. 15. But no man, I think,
will say, that Christ did then esteem the Temple to be the Holy Place, but he
names it so Docastic^s, because the Jews of Judea in general would then esteem
it and call it the Holy place, and in that respect also our Savior does call
the Romans that should enter into the Temple, The Abomination of Desolation,
just as Daniel had done, Dan. 9. 27. By this it is evident that Christ spoke by
allusion to former times: But he knew well enough that the holiness of the
Temple, as well as the typical Rest of the Holy Sabbath, were fully ended by
his death.

I grant, that the Temple was once truly called the Holy Temple, because it was
ordained to be a type of the holy humane nature of Christ wherein his Godhead
dwelt, Joh. 2: But yet this typical holiness of the Temple must needs have an
end, as soon as the Holy of Holies did but enter through the vail of his flesh
into heaven to appear before God for us, Dan. 9. 24. with Mat. 27. 50, 51. Heb.
9. 14. and the goodlinesse also of the Temple must have an end as soon as he
that was greater than the Temple had finished his Oblation, Mat. 12. 26. and by
the like reason also the Sabbath, as it was a type of our resting on the Seed
of the Woman to break the Devils Head-plot, must end as soon as Christ had
finished his Sacrifice of Atonement.

I will therefore conclude my answer to this Objection, That Christ by this
speech of his to his Disciples did but tell them what would be the common
opinion of the Nation of the Jews at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem,
as I have already declared it; but he intended no more to teach them the
continuance of the Sabbath, than the continuance of the Holiness of the
Temple; neither did he by this Caution to his Disciples intend to prefer the
Sabbath above the Lords day, no more than he intended to prefer the Winter
above the Summer, of all which things he spoke by way of caution to his
Disciples what would be the common opinion of the Jews at the destruction of
Jerusalem.

Object. 4. If Christ had ordained his Resurrection-day as the day of his
public Worship in place of the Sabbath or seventh day, then me thinks the
Apostles in their Writings should have recorded it, with the Circumstances of
it, namely, the time when, and how he did ordain it; if this had been done, the
matter had been out of question to all men.

Ans. The Wisdom of God did not see it good to make all his Ordinances clear
to all men at the first fight; when our Savior was here upon the earth, he did
oftentimes open his mouth in Parables, that they which see not might not
perceive, and that his best servants might dig for his hidden Treasures: But I
may say also it is not recorded that Christ did instruct any of his Apostles of
the time when, nor of the manner how he did first ordain John to baptize, but
because all men generally held John to be a Prophet, therefore they concluded
that he had received some authority from heaven to baptize subjects for Christ,
against he came into his Kingdom, which he proclaimed to be at hand; and by the
like authority, we may conclude that the Apostles did command the observation
of the Lords day for Gods public Worship in the place of the seventh day,
because it was in frequent use in their days, as I have proved, and they being
Prophets, had special direction from Christ the Lord of the Sabbath so to
direct his Churches, which directions in all probability they received from him
at his first coming to their Assembly in the evening of his Resurrection-day,
or else in the evening of his second coming to their Assembly, on that day
seven-night, Joh. 19. 20. 26. for then he opened their understandings to
understand such Scriptures as he alleged concerning his Joh. 19. 20, 26.
Death and Resurrection, Luke 23. 54. 47. and then also he gave them a new
Commission to preach the Doctrine of the forgiveness of sins in his name, Joh,
20. 21, 22, 23. and then he gave Commandments unto them, and spoke of such
things as appertained to the Kingdom of God, Act. 1. 2, 3. doubtless
therefore he did then instruct them concerning the day of his public worship
wherein *they must preach forgiveness of sins in his name to all the world; and
this Commission he did again renew unto them before his ascension, saying, Go
and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son, and holy
Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you, and
Io I am with you always to the end of the world. Whatsoever therefore the
Apostles commanded the Christian Churches to observe, they did it by virtue of
Christ's former command; and therefore Paul says, I have received of the Lord
that which I have delivered unto you, 1 Cor. 11. 23. The Commandments
therefore which the Apostles gave unto the Christian Churches, they were the
Commandments of Christ, among which Commandments, the observation of the
Lords day must needs be one in place of the Sabbath, which was fully abolished
by the death of Christ.

CHAP. XVI.
Being an Answer to several Questions, I Whether Christians Quest. 1.
now under the Gospel are bound to observe the Lords day as strictly from all
work, and as holily in all the duties of Religion, as the Jews were to observe
the Sabbath day.

THe Sabbath, or seventh day, must be considered, either as it Ans. 1.
was a holy sign; Or secondly, as it was the holy time of Gods worship; in the
first sense the Lords day is not like the Sabbath; for our Lords day is not a
sign of a thing to be performed by Christ, as the Sabbath was, but now our
Lords day must be observed as a memorial that Christ has fully broken the
Devils Head-plot by his Mediatorial Sacrifice; and this he has declared to his
Church by his Resurrection from the dead on the first day of the week, and in
remembrance thereof, he has now ordained that day to be employed as the
sanctified time of his worship in attending upon his Ordinances both public
and private, as strictly from all work, and as holily in all Christian duties,
as the Jews were to observe the Sabbath day under the Law, and in remembrance
thereof, John does style it the Lords day, Rev. 1. 10.

Quest. 2. Might not the Jews so much as kindle a fire upon the Sabbath day to
dress necessary food? As Mr. Ainsworth seems to understand the Exodus 16. 5.
Exodus 35. 3.
Scriptures with the consent of the Hebrew Doctors in Exodus 16. 5. and in Exodus
35. 3.

Ans. I grant, that Mr. Ainsworth does so understand the Scriptures, and so do
some of the Hebrew Doctors: But yet withal, I say, that the Scriptures rightly
understood, did always allow the Jews as much liberty to kindle a fire for the
dressing of necessary food upon the Sabbath day, as it allows Christians on the
Lords day, as it is evident by the example of our Savior himself, for he went
to a Feast upon the Sabbath day into the house Luke 14. 1.
of a chief Pharisee, Luke 14. 1. and at the same time the Pharisee had many
other guests present, for our Savior marked them how they chose out the
chiefest rooms at this Feast, v. 7, 8. And this Feast I conceive was a Wedding
Feast, though I also believe that the It is unlawful to begin a Marriage upon
the Sabbath day. Lev. 23 8.
new married parties were married before this day, and not on this day, for the
Jews held it utterly unlawful to begin their Marriage upon the Sabbath day. See
Ains. in Lev. 23. 8. But yet they held it lawful to keep a Wedding Feast upon
the Sabbath day, and the reason is plain, because they held it to be a lawful
custom to keep a Wedding Feast for seven days together, of which number the
Sabbath day must needs be one, Judge. 14. 10, 12. Genesis 29. 27, 28. And this is a
common rule among the Jews, That whosoever marieth a Maid, he shall rejoice
with her seven days, not doing any work, but eating, drinking, and making
merry. See Ains. in Genesis 29. 27.

And none could keep such a Feast of many persons in the cold Winter without
the use of a fire to make their food comfortable to nature, according to the
nature of a Feast. And it is further to be noted, that whiles our Savior was
present at this Feast, he found no fault with the act of Feasting, but only
with some corrupt circumstances which did accompany this Feast. 1 He found
fault with some of the guests, because they chose out the uppermost seats. 2 He
seemed to reprove the Governor of the Feast, because he invited his rich
friends only, verse. 12. But Christ told him it had been more suitable to the
Sabbath day if he had invited the poor to his Feast: And yet I believe it was
not sinful to bid the rich; for if it had been sinful, Christ would either
have declined the invitation, or else he would have born witness against it a^
a sinful practice; but he did neither of these, therefore it was not sinful to
invite the rich to a Feast upon the Sabbath day, where the Feast must last
seven days together.

2 I answer, That it was as lawful for the Jews to kindle a fire upon the
Sabbath day to prepare warm food for infirm and weak stomachs (which are almost
in every family) as it was to do any other work of mercy: And it was lawful to
do works of mercy upon the Sabbath days, as it is evident by our Saviors
often showing of compassion to weak and sickly persons upon the Sabbath day.

3 I answer, that the Priests did hold it lawful to kindle new fires on the
Sabbath days for the use of their Sacrifices; I grant they had one constant
and continual fire that was always maintained by the side of the Altar; but
from this fire they used to kindle other fires for the burning of such parts of
their Sacrifices as they offered on the Sabbath days. Hence I infer, that
seeing Christ Jesus has told us that he does prefer mercy before Sacrifice, no
question but he allowed the Jews to kindle a fire for works of mercy, as well
as for the use of Sacrifices, on the Sabbath day, and therefore out of doubt
they might kindle a fire on the Sabbath day to prepare necessary food for such
as are infirm of nature. See Mat. 12. 5, 6. Mat. 12* 5, 6.


4 I answer, That the Priests did kindle new fires every Sabbath day to boil or
roast their portion of meat which was due unto them from each Sacrifice by Gods
allowance; for God commanded them to eat their part and portion in the same day
wherein the Sacrifice was offered, Lev. 7. 15. but they could not eat this
portion, unless they kindled a fire, either to boil it, or roast it.

5 On the day of Atonement (which was a Sabbath of Sabbatism, and therefore
every way as strict for rest as the Sabbath or seventh day was, yet) then the
High Priest (which must of necessity often wash his Body for the several
services of that day) might, in case he were an old man, or sickly, have his
water wherein he bathed his body made warm by the use of Fire; the Hebrew
Doctors say, They took off the cold from the water either by Irons made hot in
the Fire, or else by mixing of hot water with the cold. See Ains. in Lev. 16.
24.

By these and sundry such like instances it is evident, That the Jews might
lawfully kindle a Fire upon the Sabbath Day to prepare warm meat for the
comfort of the infirm, the aged, or sickly persons.

Q^est. 3. is it not plainly said in Exodus 35. 3. Ye shall not kindle a Exodus
35. 3
fire in your Habitations upon the Sabbath Day?

Ans. Though some that are both godly and learned Christians, as well as some
later Jews, do hold it unlawful to kindle a Fire on the Sabbath Day to dress
any meat, yet the more ancient Rabbis, and many learned Christians also, do
restrain this Prohibition of kindling a Fire to Artificers only.

But for the better understanding of the true sense of this text, it is
necessary to compare it with the like prohibition in Exodus 31. 1, etc. where
the Lord commanded Moses to command Bezaliel to make the Tabernacle, and all
the appurtenances thereof, with all diligence; that is to say, with all
possible speed, without any delay, because it was to be for the place of the
Lords residence among them, Exodus 25. 8. 22. but yet notwithstanding this
careful diligence, the Lord commanded Moses, saying in ver. 13. Speak unto the
Sons of Israel, and say, Verily (or notwithstanding, Exodus 31. 13
as the Seventy read it) my Sabbaths ye shall keep, for it is a sign between
me and you, throughout your Generations, to know that I am Jehovah that
sanctifies you.

In these words God gave a double reason why they might not do any work about
the making of the Tabernacle upon the Sabbath Day.

1 Because the Sabbath was the sanctified time for his public Worship, in
these words, Verily (or notwithstanding my command of your diligence) my
Sabbaths ye shall keep.

2 Because the Sabbath was a sanctified sign between me and you throughout your
Generations, etc. ver. 13.

3 Unto all this, a threatening is added, in case any man did presume to do any
work about the Tabernacle, Every one that prophaneth Exodus 31. 14, 5
it shall be put to dye the death, ver. 14, 15.

This phrase implies, That for their double sin in profaning Gods sanctified
Time, and Gods sanctified Sign, they should be put to dye such a kind of
death, as was after a sort a double death; for 1. He must be stoned to death;
and 2. His dead body must be after his death hanged upon a Tree till Sunset,
for the greater detestation of that Sin, and for the greater terror of others;
for this is a thing upon Record in the Hebrew Doctors, That all such
Malefactors as deserved stoning to death must be hanged up afterward upon a
Tree, as it is manifest also by the instance of the rebellious Son, in Deuteronomy.
21. as I have opened the matter more at large elsewhere.

But if it be conceived by any, that if any man will now presume to gather
sticks upon the Lords Day, he should be punished with stoning to death, as the
man that gathered sticks on the Sabbath Day was;

I answer, There is not the like reason, because the Lords Day is not ordained
to be a sanctified sign of Gods resting, and of Man's resting in the Seed of the
Woman to break the Devils Headplot, as the Sabbath was.

I conclude therefore, by comparing the work of the Tabernacle in Exodus 31.
with the work of the Tabernacle, as it is repeated in Exodus 35. that the only
reason why they might not kindle a fire in their Habitations on the Sabbath Day
was, to restrain them from their eager desire, from their rash or superstitious
zeal to prosecute the work of the Tabernacle, which was commanded to be done
with such careful diligence for the place of Gods residence among them; the
Lord does prefix a prohibition to restrain them from kindling any fire for that
work, and to prevent their rash and heady zeal a threatening is annexed;
W^osoever does any work (namely of his particular Calling) upon the Sabbath
Day, shall be put to death, Exodus 35. 2. therefore ye shall kindle no fire for
that business, ver. 3.

And as it was unlawful for them to kindle a fire for such works as belonged to
their particular Callings on the Weekdays, so out of all doubt it is as
unlawful for Christians to kindle a fire on the Lords*Day to do any such
servile works as that was; but wherein can you find a prohibition wherein the
Jews are forbidden to kindle a fire on the Sabbath Day for the dressing of
necessary food for infirm or crasie bodies?

Quest. 4. It seems to me, that the Jews might not kindle a fire on the Sabbath
Day to dress any meat at all therewith; for Moses says thus, To morrow is the
Sabbath of Holiness to Jehovah, Bake that which ye will bake, and sees that
which ye will sees ( namely in the sixth day, as it is in ^er. 5.) and all
that remains over, lay it up for you as a reservation until the morrow, Exodus
16. 23. Exodus 16 23
From this Scripture I think it is evident, That the Jews were prohibited to
kindle a fire upon the Sabbath Day, neither to bake or boil any of their Manna,
but all must ^^ done on the sixth day, that so they might not kindle a fire for
it on the Sabbath Day.

Ans. This baking and boiling of their Manna before the Sabbath Day, does not
forbid them to heat their Manna with fire in the Sabbath, to make it fit for
infirm and weak stomachs; but the baking and boiling forbidden by Moses upon
the Sabbath Day, was such a baking and boiling as was accompanied with
laborious work, such as might and ought to have been done on the sixth day, as
it appears by Numb. 11. 8. there, after the people Numb. 11. 8
had gathered their Manna, they did prepare it (with laborious work) several
ways suitable to every ones taste or liking, and therefore they did* First
grind it in Mills, or beat it in Morters. Secondly, Then they baked it in
Pans, and made Cakes of it. Thirdly, Othersome did boyl^ it; and thus it was
several ways prepared and Cooked (according to every ones taste and liking)
with laborious work on the sixth day; now such kind of laborious works as these
were forbidden to be done in the Sabbath Day, because they might be done on the
sixth day; and in that respect the Hebrew Doctors say, Whosoever labors in the
evening of the Sabbath, he shall eat in the Sabbath. See Ains. in Levit. 16.
26. And truly I think there is no conscientious Christian that does hold it
lawful to defer, or put off such like laborious works as these to the Lords
Day, for it is all one as if a man should defer the grinding of his Corn, the
baking of his Bread, or the making of his Pies unto the Lords Day; but no
conscientious Christian that is judicious (I think) does hold it unlawful to
temper a P^dding of the Meal that was ground on the sixth day, or to heat a Pie
that was made on the sixth day, or to boil a necessary quantity of meat that was
killed and quartered on the sixth day, or to use that wood for fire that was
ca^ted home, and cut ready for the fire on the sixth day, or to use Water that
was fetched home to the door on the sixth day; all these, and such like things
might as lawfully be done by the Jews on the Sabbath Day, as by godly
Christians on the Lords Day; and this is fully evident by our Savior, in that
he did justify his Apostles for their work, in gathering of certain ears of
Corn in other men's fields, and rubbing the said ears, to prepare it for food,
on the Sabbath Day, and doubtless after the said rubbing it was either parched
in the Fire, or boiled in Water, fit for the digesture of the stomach, or else
if they had eaten it raw it had been but course and hard food. Now if it had
been unlawful to prepare such a small quantity of food, as was fit for the
present support of nature, on the Sabbath Day, doubtless Christ would have
commanded his Apostles beforehand, to provide their Scrip full of Victuals,
namely on the sixth day; but in as much as he had not made such provision on the
sixth day, but did justify his Apostles for this work in the Sabbath Day, by
alleging the example of David in eating the Show* bread in case of hunger, he
did thereby confute and reprove the Jews superstitious opinion of the outward
rest of the Sabbath; alleging also, That the Sabbath was made for man, and not
man for the Sabbath, Mar. 2. 27. as if Christ had said Mar. 2. 27*
thus, If man had been made for the Sabbath, then man must have served the
Sabbath before his own necessity, but seeing man was not made for the Sabbath,
but the Sabbath for man, namely to serve man's necessity, therefore it follows,
that the Sabbath was made, ordained, or instituted, after man was in necessity,
and in misery, namely after Adams Fall, chiefly for the good of his sick and
sinful Soul (and therefore God did bless it with suitable Ordinances, and did
sanctify that day for the use of those Ordinances) but yet withal the Sabbath
was made to serve man in misery, in respect of his Body, that it might rest and
be refreshed with convenient food, Physic, and the like, and therefore godly
Wisdom will make all the godly careful to improve the Lords Day so, as that it
may serve to the best good both of their sinful Soul^, and of their weak and
frail bodies also.

Quest. 5. Are Christians bound to rest on the Lords Day, as strictly from
bodily recreations, and from all things that are not work, a^ the Jews were on
the Sabbath Day for the Hebrew Doctors say? That the Jews must rest on the
Sabbath Day from things that are not work; as from climbing on a Tree, riding
on a Beast (or the like;) from the judging of Civil causes, putting off the
shoce, and taking the Brothers Wife (spoken of in Deuteronomy. 25.) separating of
Tithes, first Fruits (and the like;) valuing of things (spoken of in Levit.
27.) and from speaking with a man's partner on the Sabbath Day, what he will
buy, or how he will build his house, and the like, as it is noted by Mr. Ains.
in Exodus 20. 10. and in Exodus 31. 17.

Ans. I have showed you on the word Sanctified in Chap. 10. That God sanctified
the whole seventh day for his service, not only the time of the public
Ordinances, but the whole day, and therefore it was sanctified for the use of
private Ordinances as well as for the public, and therefore no time may be
exempted from these holy Duties but in cases of necessary food, Physic, or the
like cases of necessity; and therefore before we address our selves to Gods
public Ordinances, we must be careful to prepare our Souls to come with fear
and reverence, and so in our Hearing, in our Praying, Singing, etc. we must
take heed how we Hear, how we Pray, and Sing; so likewise afterward we must
examine our selves, how our Souls have profited by the public Ordinances, or
else we may look for a Curse, rather than a Blessing from the said Ordinances.
Hence it follows by necessary consequence, That no good Christian can allow
himself liberty to do such kind of exercises as you have named, but they will
interrupt the efficacy of those blessed and commanded Ordinances wherewith God
has blessed the seventh day, and therefore such kind of exercises must needs
be as sinful to be done by Christians upon the Lords Day, as they were by the
Jews upon the Sabbath days.

Quest. 6. Were Recreations on the Sabbath punished among the Jews by the
Magistrates, with the same kind of punishments that working on the Sabbath was?

Ans. They did not punish all sins alike, but they made a difference, for they
punished the sin of working servile works (on the Sabbath) namely such kind of
works as belonged to men's particular Callings on the Weekdays, with the
heaviest kind of death that was in use among them, namely with stoning to death
(as I have noted it in Chap. 10. and 11.) But the said Recreations or things
that were not properly work they punished only with scourging, for Maymony
speaking of the day of Atonement (which was a Sabbath of Sabbatism, and
therefore in all respects it must be observed with as strict a rest as the
seventh day was) says thus; All work for which men are to be stoned if they do
it on the Sabbath Day, they are to be cut off if they do it on the day of
Atonement; and whatsoever is unlawful to be done on the Sabbath which is not
work, is unlawful to be done on this day, and if he do it, he is to be
scourged, as he is to be scourged for doing it upon the Sabbath Day. See Ainsw.
in Levit. 23. 20.

Thus we see that the Hebrew Doctors do make a difference of Sins and
Punishments, according to the difference of days and times.

1 They held, That servile working on the seventh day was to be punished with
stoning to death.

2 They held, That servile working on the day of Atonement For cutting off,
see Ainsw. in Exodus 22. 20. Lev. 20. 10. 17* 18. Number. 9. 13
was to be punished with cutting off (which is several ways to be considered.)

3 They held, That servile working on their other festival Sabbaths was to be
punished with Scourging, or with Excommunication. See Ains. in Lev. 23. 5, and
7. But,

4 All other things that were done on the seventh day which were not work
(though in some Recreations, etc. are like work) the Magistrates punished with
Scourging only, or with Excommunication for a time, for these two were esteemed
among the Jews to be much alike equal punishments, as I have showed in the Jews
Synagogues Discipline.

And truly such kind of Recreations are as sinful to be used by Magistrates are
bound to punish the profanation of any part of the Lords Day, (whether it be
by Work, or by Recreations) either by Scou^ging, or by some Mulct that is
equivalent.
Christians on the Lords Days, as they were to the Jews on the Sabbath Day,
because they take off the Heart from the advantage of improving the public
Ordinances to the Spiritual good of the Soul, which God intended, when he
blessed and sanctified the seventh day for man's best good; I say therefore,
that no conscientious Christian ought to take liberty to do such things on the
Lords Day, neither will any conscientious Magistrate permit such things to be
done on that day, though it be after all public exercises are ended; yea I do
believe that godly Magistrates will not only be grieved at the practice of such
sins, but they will be forward and ready to put out their power to suppress
such sinful practices, by punishing such Malefactors, either with scourging, or
with some mulct that is equivalent thereto.

Six days thou sha^t labor, and in the seventh day thou shall cease in Earing
time, and in Harvest thou shall cease, Exodus 34. 21. Exodus 34. 21.


Under these two words Earing time and Harvest, All, or any other works of a
man's particular Calling, are comprehended.

Hence I reason thus:

If the Plownan (by whom the King is maintained, Eccles. 5. 9.) must cease not
only from plowing, but also from the Inning of his harvest upon the Sabbath
day, yea though all the six days had been rainy weather, and that day fair,
then it follows, that works of less consequence, and of less necessity (as
civil Recreations, and the like) ought not to be done on the Lords day,
because it is the sanctified time of Gods public worship, as the seventh day
was; and therefore Christians are bound to have the like tender regard, and the
like tender care of it as Gods sanctified time (though it be not a sanctified
sign, as the seventh day was) and seeing God is pleased to give unto us six
whole days for our necessary works, and for our necessary recreations, he may
well require Christians to give unto him the full improvement of the seventh
day for the bettering of our souls by his public and private Ordinances, or
else we may expect a curse rather than a blessing* from the careless
observation of that day.

God is jealous of the profanation of any part of his sanctified time; for
when the greedy Earthworms among the Jews did but wish in secret in their
hearts, that the Sabbath were gone that they might set out their corn to sell,
Amos 8. 5. Amos 8. 5.


God took notice of their inward profaning of his holy time, and he was so
displeased with them for their inward earthly wishes, that he Swear by the
Excellency of Jacob, saying, Surely I will never forget any of their works;
Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwells therein?
verse. 7, 8.

Now seeing God was so displeased with them for their secret profanation of
the sanctified time of his worship by their worldly thoughts and desires (yea
though it were but after Gods public worship was ended) then doubtless
seeing* Jesus Christ has still reserved the seventh part of time for his
public worship, he will not allow Christians now more liberty than the Jews
had, either to profane thoughts, or to sport and recreate themselves on the
Lords day; no, though it should be after the public exercise is ended: God
requires the heart on that day, as well as the body, to be employed on
spiritual things only. The promise in Es. 58. 13. (to such as make conscience
of sanctifying the Sabbath in the inward man) I confess, is made to that
Sabbath of Sabbatism called the day of Atonement, but yet this day of
Atonement must be considered as it was a Sabbath of equal respect in regard of
the sanctified time of Gods worship to the seventh day, and therefore that
which is unlawful to be done in the one, is unlawful to be done in the other
also, both in respect of the outward, and also in respect of the inward man.

Quest. 7. Did not the Jews hold it lawful to do works of mercy and works of
present necessity on the Sabbath day?

Ans. 1. In the days of our Savior, some of the Jews were so supestitious of
the outward rest of the Sabbath, that they were often offended with our
Savior, because he did works of mercy, and works of necessity on the Sabbath
day; but it was not so with the Jews from elder times; Maymony says, If a
Thief dig through a house upon the Sabbath day, it is free for any to kill him
with any death they can put him to. See Ains. in Exodus 22. 2. This they allowed
Exodus 22. 2.
as a case of present necessity, it could not be deferred, as a Magistrate may
defer the putting off a Malefactor to death, until any one of the six days,
because the Magistrate has the Malefactor in safe custody in some sure prison;
and therefore they say, It is not lawful to put a Malefactor to death on the
Sabbath day, because it is written that no fire shall be kindled upon the
Sabbath day, Exodus 35. 3. namely not for the use of any man's particular Calling
(as I have already opened this Text) therefore no fire may be kindled upon the
Sabbath day for the execution of a Malefactor, for that was but the work of the
Magistrates civil See Ains. in Exodus 35. 3.
Calling. See Ains. in Exodus 18. 22. and yet notwithstanding they held it
lawful for the Magistrate to put a Malefactor to death upon a Festival Sabbath
(as it appears by their practice in Joh. 19. 31.
putting our Savior to death on a Festival Sabbath, for they did not hold
those Sabbaths to be equal to the seventh day) but if a Thief came to steal on
the Seventh day, and was taken in diging through an house, they held it lawful
for a private man to kill him on the Sabbath day (though they did not hold it
lawful for a Magistrate to kill a Thief then) because it was a case of present
necessity, for he might escape unless he were killed at that instant.

And truly Christians may do as much as this on the Lords day, and no more,
without sin.

2 Our Savior confuted the Jews superstitious conceit of the outward rest of
the Sabbath, by examples from their own practice; for when they took offense at
his miraculous cures upon the Sabbath day, he asked them why they held it
lawful to untie their Cattle, and lead them to the water upon the Sabbath day,
and so to give them Hay and Provender, and to pull a Sheep out of the pit upon
the Sabbath day; and therefore said he, Why may not I show mercy to a Daughter
of Abraham that is in misery upon the Sabbath day? And seeing they held it
lawful for Abiathar to give the Shewbread to hungry David, he asked them, Why
it was not as lawful for his hungry Disciples to pluck ears of corn and to rub
them, and prepare them for the sustenance of their present hunger upon the
Sabbath day; and after Christ had cured the Criple, he bad him take up his bed
and walk, to save it from spoiling, and from loss, upon the Sabbath day; and
when he cured blind eyes upon the Sabbath day with clay tempered into a salve,
he did it to warrant Surgeons, and Physicians, that they might lawfully
temper their Potions and Plasters upon the Sabbath day to cure the sick and
weak.

By these, and such like examples in the New Testament, our Savior declared
what liberty God gave unto the Jews, to do works of mercy, or of present
necessity, upon the Sabbath day; and truly those Christians that will contend
for more liberty than this upon the Lords day, do in effect deny, that the
Lords day was ordained with any solemn sanctity.

3 Though the present Apostate Jews did malign our Savior for doing many works
of mercy, and in present necessity, upon the Sabbath day; yet the ancient
Hebrew Doctors, recorded by their later Doctors, held otherwise: They say, that
the peril of life puts away the Sabbath, and therefore to a sick person that
is in danger of death, they do all things needful for him upon the Sabbath
day. See Ains. in Exodus 20. 10. And though the Hebrew Doctors do affirm that
Circumcision in the time thereof does drive away the Sabbath, because there was
a necessity of doing it on the eighth day, (See Ains. in Genesis 17. 12.) yet say
the Hebrew Doctors, in case of sickness they do not circumcise him that is
sick, until he be well; (and again) they circumcise none but children that are
without sickness, for peril of life puts away all. See Ains. on Genesis 17.
13. And on the day of Atonement which was a Sabbath of Sabbatism for strict
rest, yet then they made ready provision of food for him that lead the
Scapegoat into the Wilderness, yea though that Sabbath was also an exceeding
strict Fasting-day; yet then at the end of every mile they said unto him that
lead the Scapegoat, Lo here is meat, and here is water, and if his strength
failed him, and if he had need to eat, he might eat. See Ains. in Lev. 16. 21.
The Hebrew Doctors also say, That if the High Priest were an old man, or
sickly, he might have the water made warm, wherein he washed his body on that
strict Sabbath of Atonement, either by Irons made hot in the fire, or else by
the mixture of some hot water with the cold. See Ains. in Lev. 16. 24. By
these, and the like testimonies, we see that the ancient Hebrew Doctors held
that the Sabbath was made for man in misery, not only for the curing of his
sick and sinful soul by those blessed Ordinances wherewith God did at first
bless the seventh day, but even for the curing and comforting of his weak and
sickly body; and these are the chief ends for which the Sabbath was ordained
from the very first Institution of it.

And the Hebrew Doctors were very careful to provide a remedy against
immoderate toil and labor to men's bodies in traveling to the public
Ordinances which were dispensed every Sabbath day in their Synagogues: For by
virtue of Gods Command, there was a necessity laid upon all the Jews to resort
to some holy Convocation in all their dwellings, Lev. 23. 3. namely, in all
their Lev. 23. 3.
Synagogues, which must be placed in the midst of their dwellings. Hence the
Hebrew Doctors knowing the Command of God for such holy Convocations in all
their dwellings; (and knowing the Command of God to rest on the seventh day
from all their works) did appoint a certain distance how far men might travel
on the Sabbath day to the Synagogue, and they thought good to restrain it to an
English mile, to prevent the labor of travel, and the weariness of men's
bodies which might unfit them for the reverend attention to Gods Ordinances;
and from this limited space, it is that we read of a Sabbath days journey,
Act. 1. 12. They did not ordain this Sabbath days Acts 1. 12.
journey for any Civil businesses of men's particular Callings, but for the use
of Religious duties, and for works of mercy on the Sabbath day.

And this proportion of a mile they took from the example of Gods limits which
he allowed to the Suburbs of their Cities, for the Suburbs of their Cities
might not exceed two thousand Cubits by measure, Number. 35. 5. The like distance
God appointed between the Camp of Israel and the Ark of the Lords Covenant when
they passed over the River Jordan, Jos. 3. 4. From these eminent examples the
Hebrew Doctors ordained that no Tent should be pitched in the Wilderness, nor
no House in the Land of Canaan, above two thousand Cubits from their
Synagogue-assemblies, which is an English mile; and this distance they usually
called A Sabbath days journey.

And this order was a provident provision both for the propagation of the Word
(for by such short distances from their Synagogues they must have many
Synagogues) and in order to a work of Mercy to their bodies, that they might
not weary their bodies by long travel, when they came unto Gods presence to be
partakers of his holy Ordinances; but in cases of necessity (they not
withstanding this restraint to a mile) when the means of Grace did by any
occasion fail in any of their Synagogues at home, then they held it without
scruple lawful to go further, as we may s^e by the liberty that the People took
in the days of Christ, for then they did leave their Synagogues to follow his
preaching from place to place; and if Christ had held their practice to be
unlawful, doubtless he would have reproved them, and bid them keep their own
Synagogues, and not follow him from place to place as they did; and for the
attaining of such excellent means of Grace, the people also held it lawful to
leave their own Synagogues, and to break the outward rest of the Sabbath by
longer Journies, and greater Bodily labor; and so we see that the Priests in
the Law did break the outward rest of the Sabbath by their laborious killing
and dressing of Sacrifices, and yet they were blameless, Man. 12. 5. 1 Chro.
23. 31. and so also for their Bodily food, they did kindle Fires to Roast and
Boil the portion of their Sacrifices ^it for their stomachs every Sabbath Day;
for their portions must be eaten in the same day in which the Sacrifice was
offered, nothing thereof must remain until the morning; but in case any part of
their portions did remain until the morning, it must be burnt, Levit. 7. 15.
Exodus 12. 10.

I conclude therefore, That the Jews had as much liberty in all respects to do
any thing on the Sabbath Day, tending to the good of their Souls, or to their
Bodies, either in cases of necessity or mercy, as Christians have upon the
Lords Day; but both sorts have corrupt hearts alike, and have alike need to
watch unto the sanctified improvement of the whole day; and both sorts have the
same Adversary the Devil to deal withal, and therefore both sorts have need
alike to keep a good watch over Satan, and over their own corrupt hearts, or
else the spiritual efficacy of Gods Holy Ordinances will be lost and vain,
which is the only thing that the Devil desires to effect, that he may rejoice
in the ruin of our Souls.

O that Christians therefore would submit their Consciences to the command of
Christ, to keep the Lords Day as strictly from outward works, and as holily in
all Christian duties, as ever the Jews did, or ought to have kept the Sabbath
Day.

And so Jehovah cause his face to shine upon every Soul that truly honors the
sanctified time of the Lords Day, and the solemnity of all public and private
holy duties.

Amen, Amen.
The end of the First Part.
