AN ALARM Sounded forth from the Lord God of Vengeance unto England's Rulers,
Mayors, Magistrates, and Unjust Judges, who are found Oppressors of the Seed
and Heritage of God: For whose sakes the Lord God is risen to plead, and
suddenly will bring Destruction on them all, if they repent not; and this I
publish in God's Authority.
HOwl, howl, howl, ye Inhabitants of the Earth; for the voice of God's thunders
are gone forth against you, and the Lord God is risen in Jealousy to plead by
the Sword of his Eternal Power, and all must know the fire of the Lord God's
Indignation to pass over them, who are found this day opposing the work of the
Lord God, who will work and none shall let him, who shall work and none shall
hinder him; And blessed are all who are found clear of oppressing the work of
the Lord; for verily on whom the Stone falls on, it shall grind him to powder;
and whosoever falls upon it shall be broken in pieces. And God has determined
the deliverance of his own Seed, which trusts in his name; and for their
sakes the Lord God, who is a consuming fire, will break forth suddenly, to the
utter ruin and destruction of all his enemies, and all shall burn as an Oven;
for God is kindling of a fire among the Briers and Brambles of the Earth, an
utter consumption is coming upon them all: As God brought the Flood in Noah's
days upon the world for the wickedness thereof, even so is the Lord bringing
of an overflowing scourge, which shall sweep away the Wicked by the Besom of
his own destruction.

Woe unto the World, and all that are found therein, Judgment is begun already
at the House of God, and who shall abide the day of his coming, wherein he will
set as with Finers fire; then shall the heavens pass away as a scrowl, with
lightning, with thundering, and with earthquakes; then shall the elements melt
with fervent heat; then shall every man's works be tried by fire; and this the
Trumpet of the Lord of Hosts which is blown to you all, dread, fear and tremble
before the terrible God, who will shake both heaven and earth, who removes the
foundations thereof; and verify the Lord God will roar out of Sion with a voice
of terrible thunder, and at the sound thereof all the beasts of the field shall
tremble; For this is the day of the Lord God, wherein he will shake the
kingdoms of darkness, and the powers thereof shall fall, and the Lord only shall
be exalted over all: and again will he dash the potshards of the earth to
pieces; and this day is at hand wherein Overturning, Overturning shall come from
the mighty hand of the Lord, and such a down fall is near, as never was the
like in the Nation of England; this is the Lord's bringing to pass, that all
may know, that only he alone reigns over all, who has power to do
whatsoever he will; then shall all know that God is in the midst of the most
contemptible, despised remnant, who are not counted worthy to live upon the
earth; but blessed are they from the Lord God, and they shall be blessed,
although all the enchanters of Egypt study mischief against the Israel of God,
yet their divinations shall not hurt Jacob, nor the enchantments prosper against
Israel the called of God, none shall be like unto them; yea, they shall shine in
glory, to the tormenting of Egypts Dogs, who are barking and biting, who are
like Wolves, tearing and renting the Lambs of the Fold of God's everlasting
rest, but they cannot rent them from the rest, not pluck them from the Fold,
neither can they take any of them out of the hands of the good Shepherd, who
watches over his both night and day; for the Wolf comes in the night, so the
Wolves are in the night. The Dogs are in the darkness, and for mad they bite,
being set on fire from hell, who are subjects of the Prince of Darkness, which
is the Captain whom they follow, who is the King of the bottomless pit, who
has now sent forth his messengers, with all the wise men of Egypt, who are
seeking for the Man-child to destroy it; but it is hidden from them all, so all
that they shall slay and destroy is but the Firstborn of Egypt, which is the
son of perdition, which is to be drawn in the gulf of misery. And this is the
day when God's work does prosper, and his truth shall spread and increase, and
thousands shall be gathered unto it, and many shall come from the East and from
the West, and shall walk in the Light of the Lord God, whose day shall be
glorious, to the astonishment of the Nations, and never did the sons of Adam
since the beginning ever see the like glory which the Lord God is now revealing,
shall shine over all, at whose bright appearance mountains shall fall, and the
hills shall melt at the dreadful presence of the living God, whose glory shall
burn through all the clouds, and the rising of the Sun shall make them all to
vanish; so glorious, so excellent shall be the day of God, that none shall be
able to abide it, but they that can dwell with everlasting burnings; then shall
Gods enemies fall, then shall his power and his glory shine over all; then shall
his throne be established on the tops of the Mountains, and all shall cast down
their Crowns before him; then shall the Kingdoms of the World become the
Kingdoms of God, then shall Halelujahs be sung over all by the redeemed of the
Lord; and now is the shout of a King gone forth, founding this Alarm unto all
Englands Rulers, Mayors, and Magistrates, Justices and Judges, proclaiming the
day of the Lord which is coming on them all: Fear, tremble and dread the living
God from whom this is sent, and published

By me Dorothy White.
