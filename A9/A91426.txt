THE Poet's Blind man's bough, OR Have among you my blind Harpers:

BEING A pretty medicine to cure the Dim, Double, Envious, Partial, and
Diabolical eyesight and Judgment OF Those Dogmaticall, Schismatic,
Aenigmaticall, and nou Gramaticall Authors who Lycentiously, without either
Name, License, Wit or Charity, have raylingly, falsely, and foolishly written a
numerous rabble of pesteferous Pamphelets in this present (and the precedent
year, justly observed and charitably censured,

By Martine Parker.

Printed at London by F. Lea^h, for Henry Marsh, and are to be sold at his
shop over against the golden Lion Tavern in Princes street. 1641.

TO THE TRVLY JUDICIOUS, IMPARTIAL CHARITABLE, AND IMPREIVDICATED CHRIstian
Reader of what quality, age or sex soever, the Author dedicates his poor
endevors and referrs himself with the same.
1.
RIigh Honorable, Worshipful, and right
Iuditious Chrian Readers be content,
Kindly t'accept what (to give all delight,
And vindicate my self) I did invent,
For to no other end this time I spent
But in this small compendium to frame
Something thae's short and true; Liars to shame.
2.
Here Is matter both for modesty and sport,
With charitable reprehentions for
Those who have filled both Country, City, Court
And Camp with Lybells void of reason, or
The fear of Heaven (who does such things abhor)
Buy, Read, and Judge, then questionless you will say,
That I have shown fair (for their base) foul play
3.
Still I hope good men will contented be,
With what is Published by (abused) M. P.
Who never wrote but in the Just defense,
Of's King and Country; now is own innocence.
THE POET'S BLIND MAN'S BOVGH.
COme Niminsis lend me little twigge,
Though these delinquents faults are very big,
Yet I (though much exasperared) will
Mix mercy with revenge; do good for ill.
My work may now be termed a demi Satir,
My muse hates Railing, as she Scorns to Flatter,
Though Justice hold her scales with equal poyse,
Charity sways the beam; she none destroyse,
Some she will check, and tell them of their deeds,
From which rebuke if happily proceeds,
Any amendment, she will be like the nurse,
That whipps a child whom she loves never the worse,
Should I but give them their deserved due,
Whom though I know not that most shameless crew
Ofn melesse Authers, Authors all of lies,
Of slanderous Pasquills railing falicies,
I might my pen dip in that learnean Sink,
Which the infernal furies use for ink,
Or with Iambean rimes Ironicall,
Make lines should serve for ropes to hang them all
But noe such cruelty is in my breast,
All my abuses I can take in Jest,
And give such Idiots leave to write or speak.
Eagles slight notice take when crows do creake
You cankers of the state, nay rather you.
Vulters; when law and death have said their due,
Do even gnaw the heart of him that is dead,
In this regard may't not be truly so said,
That you are Pluto's fiddlers; that for pay,
Upon the guts oath dead do play and pray,
Presumptious, Petulent, flagitious, dolts do,
Untrue, unserviceable, unback'd cotes,
Durst you beyond the letter of the Law,
Presume among your selves to hang and draw
You do asume the place, to say the troth,
Of Aprehender, Judge, and hangman both,
When any has offended against the state
Must such as you the fact exagerate,
Have you such clear eyes that you can esp'y,
The little moate that is in your brothers eye,
Making a mountain of each molehill when
You do not see the beams (O senseless men)
That in your own eyes so prevents your Sight
And Judgment that you dare (be it wrong or right)
Save or condemn at pleasure; can your pates,
Determine more then Law or Magistrates,
Of these your facts he who will censure best,
Cannot but say that you intend to wrest,
The sword of Justice from the hand of them
To whom it is due by Justice to condemn,
Or save with mercy; heaven forbid I should,
Excuse the faults of those whom Law does hold,
Worthy of punishment, or death, or bonds,
My very Soul most aptly Coresponds,
With this; and so it ever shall that those,
Whom Law does prove my King or countries foes,
That they have their demerits, cursed be him,
(For my part) that where Justice does condemn,
Will wish to save; especially Such men,
Whose deeds deserves worse then a vulgar pen.
Upon them can confer; yet (take my word)
More danger comes bith'quill then by the Sword,
Let those delinquents of the higher strain,
Alone with what is said; and now again,
My muse returns unto her task: which is
To tell these Libellers what deep abuse,
Of hellish skill, they have sounded to compose,
Such fond invectives both in rhyme and prose.
Nay come along never shrink or blush for shame,
Their none knows either of you by your name;
Those you were 'sham'd to show, there is reason for it,
Least after ages a deserved sport
Might make of you (or your posterity,)
Unnamed the Authors sh^me with his lines will die.
But my desire and whole intent is that,
Your folly being in general aimed at
Each on may take his share of shame and say,
In doing this I have not showed fair play:
For what is either more or less set forth
against persons in particular; what worth
Or same among the vulgar it may win
Without the Authors name't has ever bin
Held as a Lybell both in Law and sense,
Then he who writes (what e're be his pretense)
His name should justify what he has done,
This maxim I have always thought upon
What ever yet was published by me,
Was known by Martin Parker, or M.P.
All Poets (as adition to their sames)
Have by their Works eternized their names,
As Chaucer, Spencer, and that noble earl,
Of Surriet ought it the most precious pearl,
That dick'd his honor, to Subscribe to what
His high engenue ever amed at
Sydney and Shaksspire, Drayton, Withers and
Renowned Ionson glory of our Land:
Deker, Learned Chapman, Haywood althought good,
To have their names in public understood,
And that sweet Seraph of our Nation, Quarles
(In spite of each planatick cur that snarles)
Subscribes to his Celestial harmony,
While Angels chant his Dulcid melody.
And honest John from the water to the land
Makes us all know and honor him by's hand;
And many more whose names I should have told
In their due place, in famous record inrould.
Have thought it honest honor to set down
Their names or letters to what is their own:
But you a litter of blind whelps begot
By Cerberus, the scumme of natur's pot,
Suborned by malice and a little gains,
Invent and publish what your frothy brains,
Envaporate some prose and some in rimes,
Only to please the fancy of the times
Idle Chemeras, structurs seeming fair,
Which vew'd, are proved mere castles in the air.
Almanake Makers, were they of your mind,
(In stead of Saints to every day a signed)
Might make a transmutation, and name all
By your quotiadian Pamphlets critical,
And days caniculer should last all the year,
If curish writers they may domineere;
The Press is overprest, and (justly) groans
Under the burden of those heavy tones
Of Scritch-oule music, threatening death and hell,
One striving all in malice to excel;
And he who can best rail, scoff, and invent,
The greatest lies, shall give the most content:
Is this the age that does most truth profess,
Are these the days of zeal and righteousness;
Are these the times that has more light discovered
Revealing secrets that in darkness er'd
Why then, O why are lies and falshhoods spread,
Shall men by lying earne their daily bread:
Shall truth thus suffer paper persecution,
Shall things well ordered hazard a confusion
By those unsanctified pens which write
Nothing but what to mischief may incite,
Inventing still the theory of plots
Which none to practice ever thought these sots
Bewray their folly; for they want both wit
And judgment, for their fables do not fit
The last of probability, which should,
Produce such reasons for the tale that is told,
That they who hear it may conjecture that
It may be true; but these men care not what
They write, be it contradictory or not,
So they can get the silver by the plot;
But (as friends) I friendly them advise,
That if hereafter they write any lies
Let them mote likely be then that which was
Composed by some short hayr'd, long eared Ass,
Of a strange plot (beyond immagination
To give the Archbishop his free relaxation
Out of the Tower by Necromantick spells,
Themselves did only know it, but none else.
Note how that ancient liar (most accursed,)
A liar even from the very first
Beginning of the world, by's instruments,
With subtilty men's judgments circumvents,
Making the fabric of his building all
Of lies, which fools esteem Authentical;
Yet power divine so boundeth him and his,
That of there envious aims they often mis,
Shaming themselves (by over reaching) so,
That even to fools, their shame they freely sho,
As well appears in this immagin'd plot,
Making the world believe that which was not
Had such a thing (being 'twas known a fiction,
And might at hom expect a contradiction)
Bin feigned to be in Cornwall or in Wales,
Cumberland, or Yorkshire; then such tales
Perhaps might win belief; but here in the city
Where every child of eight years old that is witty,
Knows there was no such thing, oh what disgrace
Is this toth' Author durst he show his face,
Or set his name toth' fable, stay there sir,
We Will not be known so palpably to er;
The aim the Author shot at is to bring
Papists in hatred; it is a pious thing.
But tell me brother (how orby what chance)
Came thou to play on peoples ignorance,
Think thou the worlds all wild and all men mad,
That they will condeme those whom thou countest bad,
Has not the Honorable Parliament,
(That hopeful Senate) wisdom to prevent,
Such machinations (if there any were)
But who must dictate to them, do not fear,
Future examinations for such crimes
Or do thou mean ever to trust these times:
What is th'archbishop to the Papists that
They should adventure life and frrtune at
So dear a rate, he never was their friend,
Arminians never did on Room depend;
It Is known apparently what sad report,
Papists may give the High commission Court;
'Twas high indeed for them, two high a rate
Poor men did pay: which might exact a hate
Rather then love; but charity says no,
Let law take place, it is fit it should be so,
Heaven grant his Grace from the well spring of grace,
And that he may return while he has space
Unto the thrown of grace; by penetence,
Let us not agravate what is his offense:
Nor whiles I Am speaking of th'Archbishops case,
Let me examine that malicious base,
And senseless Libell Mercuries Message named,
Whom the Author to recognize was ashamed.
And well he might, for amongst his lies unholy
One thing ath' first does most bewray his folly,
And that is the Cronagram which he to make
Upon the Archbishops name does undertake;
And by the numegall letters there express
He would denote the number of the beast
Mentioned in the Apocalips which is,
Six hundred sixty six, now censure his,
Deduction and doubt not but you will find
(As I have done) the beast lay's beastly mind,
How like a monstrous beast 'twixt dog and ass
He enviously and simply does pass,
His verdiction the man, for thus writes he
It Is WILL: LAWD,
Two V's he numbers ten J one, three L's,
Seven score and ten, (thus he his lesson speles)
V for five more, D for five hundred, thus
He makes six hundred sixty sixth, let us
Confess it is true so far, but to condem
The Prisoner, he omits both I and M,
Which is the name, and makes the number even,
One thousand six hundred sixty seven.
See now this envious Cynick, how to win,
Credit amongst fools commits a deadly sin,
For surely malice was predominant.
Nor can I think the fool so Ignorant;
As that he would or could assume to frame;
A Chronagram and knew not the right name,
Or else his spite was so toth' Bishops that,
He would deprive him oth' most part of what,
His Godfather did give him at the Font.
Is this your calculation, out upon it;
But should this envious Author undertake,
A Chronagram or Anagram to make;
For any one of whom he is a lover,
Were an unlern'd Translator or a Glover;
A Currier or a Weaver, then no doubt,
Rather then he would leave leter out,
He Would venture to exchange or else to add,
So he could make a good sense of a bad:
He would (perhaps) But M. In the N's place,
To make it answer to the year of grace.
But the Archbishop (whom few now applaud)
Must be contented to be called Will Laud.
But one thing I much marvel at; which is,
That he who answered it, with the cimphasis,
Of wit and sense; who stoutly did defend,
the Archbishop as his Champion and true friend,
Exacting praise from some, from others blame,
Yet never censured this false chronagram
Which negligence and monsterous over-fight,
Extenuats his credit who did write,
That Vindication; passed as the rest,
Without the Authors name: though it is guest,
That Thomas Herbert wrote it, but that fame,
Rose from th'Acrostick known to be his name,
Written by him ath' end oth' book, that is all,
The reason which indeed's irationall.
For no man that is the author of a book
But sets his name whereon all easly look
Upon the frontispeece (or title page)
Unless he be proposterous (like the age,)
But let that pass; for I must pass from this
To other things, wherein are more amiss;
More malice; more absurdity, and more
Nonsense then any mentioned before,
A plot discovered of an army good,
Secretly lurking in a private wood.
If any such be in Northhamptonshire
Where Soldiers, all unknown to the neighbors near
Could lie in ambush such a multitude,
And be maintained with quotidian-food,
With other necessaries fit for men
Let any of indifferent judgment scan
Each circumstance of this pretended plot,
And they will find the Author out a Sot:
One that so far beyond all dissability
Does stretch his lies (which shows his imbiscility)
That even to children he bewraies his shame,
One man's the Author of both plots, his name John Thomas.

I since have understood, who on no ground
But his pesteferous fancy to confound,
Those who never meant him harm
That this his poisonous venim spits a broad,
Bewraying envy, Ignorance, and spleen
And all in vain, for not one in fifteen
Gives credit to's narrations; and those few,
That are so confident to think all tru^,
Are some whose judgments are p^^^^^^cated
With malice; people so consop^
In mischife; must by ignorance that they
Believe what any one can write or say,
So't be against those whom they do affect
But any of well governed intelect
(Whose judgments are with reason regulated)
Will say of Knave and fool naught can be bated,
So let him rest till heaven turn his heart,
To mix more charity with his small art,
That he and all the rest oth' Pamphletees,
May use more fervent prayers, and fewer Ieeres,
To practice truth (which all of them pretend,
And not their precious time so lewdly spend
In sowing tears of Schismie and debate,
By devilish means falsehood to propogate;
Shaming themselves, not whom they seek to shame,
Blaming of other people, when the blame
Upon their own heads justly may be laid
I do admire that they are not afraid,
Of divine Judgment which on them might fall,
When against conscience and law rational,
They do invent such execrable lies,
To make men odious in the peoples eyes,
Contrary to all charity, and grace
Making their fond Chemeras to take place,
In stead of solid truth, these are the men
Who make a show of zeal, and conscience when
Their deeds and writings against the public weal
Prove they have neither conscience, truth nor zeal;
Charity bids us pray one for another,
But brother here vituperates his brother:
But why (may some men say) should this man be
The only Censurer; could none but he
Epsy these (...) must he be the only man
The works (...) men to search and scan,
Yes reader whosoev'r thou be I this
Must tell thee freely, there good reason is
For what is done or to be done, and more
Then charity will suffer; which in store,
The author ever keeps to regulate
His words and deeds against all who do him hate,
For he 'bove all the rest has wronged been
Tasting the bitter gall of hellish spleen,
Which these malignant serpents could eiect
To make the world his innocence suspect,
In diverse pamphlets, what e're currish barker
The author was, he snarl'd at Martin Parter.
Nor Borealist by some brother pen,
Yet fathered on asect to this end,
To bring me in disgrace; as though I had,
Bin punished heretofore for writing bad,
Calling me th'Prelats Poet and such terms,
Which nothing but his spite at all confirms,
For I never wrote in the Bishops cause so much,
As now I have on this occasion touch.
Another foolish idle defamation
That is intitl'd the Popish Proclamation,
The unnam'd Author (as in all a raylor)
Ocasion takes to abuse me and John Tailor
With Herbert, but wherefore I cannot tell,
Nor he himself that wrote it very well;
For he one whom though his will were bent,
Wants ability for his intent:
And yet he could in his bare garden stuff,
(Which with Tobaco I do take in snuff)
Take liberty to name me in his Ieeres,
But in his works such plain nonsense appears,
That I accout his pen to be no slander,
From true method he so far does wander,
That all who read may judge (if they have wit)
That what he writes although his name's to it,
Deserves no approbation; yet this lad
I malice not, but rather should be glad,
To know him change his envy for more skill
He can'ot disgrace me, writing what he will.
Thus much for him, and indeed all the rest
To none I am angry an enemy protest,
But wish them more good then themselves will do,
I will be patient and Physician too.
FINIS.
Postscript.
PErhaps the Reader may expect I should,
More of these slaunderus, envious sleights unfold,
Because they more deserve; indeed it is true
Write what I can I shall not give them their due:
This little therefore serves for a taste,
By which more may be guest there is too much waste
Of paper made alread, in two years:
By these calumnious idle pamphleteeres,
Should this diurnall Lavish, two years more
Continue; we may fear (there is cause wherefore)
That we should scarce get paper for good use,
If we persevere in this great abuse,
I have but broke the Ice, some coadiuters
Will help to scourge these paper-persecuters.
FINIS.
