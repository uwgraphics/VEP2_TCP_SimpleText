A DECLARATION of the Committee of Estates concerning their Proceedings in
opposition to the late unlawful Engagement against England.
THe manifold dangers to Religion, to the Kings Majesty, to our Laws and
Liberties, and to the Peace of these Kingdoms, are so manifest, that they
cannot be hid from any, who will not wilfully shut their eyes against a clear
light: and the remedies which we have taken in this extremity, will (we doubt
not) be judged by all men of common equity and understanding, to have been most
necessary for preserving Religion from ruin, and our selves from slavery and
oppression: Yet, to prevent m sinformation and misconstructions, we have
thought fit to publish a short narration of the Causes of our late undertaking
to rise in arms, of our proceedings by way of Treaty with those that joined in
arms for the late Engagement against England, and of our resolutions for
settling Religion, and the Peace of this distracted Kingdom, and strengthening
the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, which are the best foundations of Honor and
Happiness to the King; whose Throne we desire may be established in
Righteousness.

When we look back upon some proceedings in our neighbor Nation, though there
we see that the work of Reformation has been much obstructed, and many things
have been done, of which we cannot approve, and wherewith God was highly
displeased; yet we find the Fountain and Spring of all our troubles mainly to
arise at home, from the craft and malice of our Natives and Countrymen. For,
notwithstanding the Right Honorable Houses of the Parliament of England had
offered by their Commissioners to remove all differences which had arisen
betwixt them and us, and to do whatever was just and Honorable for the
satisfaction of this Kingdom: And further, had declared their readiness to
join with this Kingdom in the Propositions agreed on by both Kingdoms,
presented to the King at Hampton Court, for the making such further proceedings
thereupon as should be thought fit, for the speedy settlement of the Peace of
both Kingdoms, and preservation of the Union according to the Covenant and
Treaties. And further, to give satisfaction in all things which should be
judged necessary for the Peace of both Kingdoms, not intrenching upon the
particular Interest of the Kingdom, and Privileges of the Parliament of
England: yet many of this Nation having entered into a sinful Association and
wicked Combination, did join together in Arms under the command of the Duke of
Hamiltoun, for pursuance of an unlawful Engagement against our neighbor
Nation of England, contrary to the ends of the solemn League and Covenant, the
manifold admonitions and exhortations of all the faithful Ministers of the
Gospel, the warnings and Declarations of Commissioners of the General
Assembly, 1647. As likewise against the unanimous proceedings of the late
General Assembly in this year 1648; against the Judgment and Protestations of
many Members of Parliament, who have been most constant in the Cause, and to
preserve the Union betwixt the Kingdoms; and generally against the minds and
judgments of all the well-affected in the Kingdom: And further, brought over
from Ireland some Regiments of the Scots Army to join with them in this
Engagement, contrary to the Treaty betwixt the Kingdoms of the 7 of July 1642.
And having joined in an unlawful Association with the Malignants of England,
did employ some of them to surprise and take the Garrisons of Berwick and
Carlisle (and yet professed openly before the World, they were ignorant who had
done it) contrary to the large Treaty betwixt the Kingdoms, and the Treaty of
the 29 of November 1643. And when by miserable and cruel oppression of the
people of God in this Kingdom they had gathered together a numerous Army, they
took possession of the Garrisons of Berwick and Carlisle, and in an hostile
manner entered into our Neighbor Nation; where the Lord of Hosts poured forth
his Wrath and Indignation upon them for their lies and hypocrisy, as was
before threatened by many of the faithful servants of God in this Kingdom.

While these men were invading England, the Earl of Lanerick and others engaged
in the same Design, stayed at home to oppress this Kingdom; and under a
pretense of raising a Guard for the Prince, did begin a new Levy of Forces,
whereby they might be able to send supply to their Army in England, if need
were; but principally to bear down the godly and well-affected in this Kingdom,
and force upon them unlawful Bands and Oaths, which they devised to be
engines and snares to compel men to make Shipwreck of their Consciences, by
joining with all their wicked ways, or in case they refused to take those
accursed Oaths, and subscribe their Bands, that then they might not only be
incapable of all public Trust, but be esteemed and used as Enemies to
Religion, King and Kingdom; and so every way to oppress all honest men in
their Persons, Estates and Consciences, as nothing was to be expected from
their Government to these who desired to fear the Lord, and adhere to their
first Principles, but slavery and ruin: for they having adjourned the
Parliament till March 1650, had assumed to themselves an Arbitrary Power, that
in the mean time they might rule at their pleasure, and make such alterations
in the Kingdom as they thought fit. Upon news of the defeat of their Army, they
did give out Commissions to prime Incendiaries, and encouraged such as were
eminent and active in Rebellion, under the conduct of James Graham late Earl of
Montrose, to rise in Arms; and sent directions to the Forces under the command
of George Monro, which had invaded England, but were not present at the Fight,
and other Officers and Soldiers who escaped from it, to return to this
Kingdom, that so by their conjunction with the Forces lately raised, they might
have a new Army on foot to prosecute their former design, and to tyrannize
over this Kingdom, as is evident from their Letters of the 28 of August, sent
to the Earl of Marshall Vicount of Dudhope, Clerk Register, and George Monro,
(ten days after the defeat of their Army in England) wherein speaking of the
Engagement, they declare their resolution to recruit their Regiments, and to
hazard their Lives and Fortunes, and all that was dearest unto them for
carrying on against all opposition whatsoever that pious and loyal Service,
and that they and many others of this Kingdom did intend not to live and
outlive it: By all which, and many other their like proceedings expressed in
the Declarations of the General Assembly and their Commissioners, it is
sufficiently evident that Religion has not only been endangered, but the whole
work of Reformation in these Kingdoms for these ten years past has been very
near to be wholly overturned, our Laws and Liberties almost destroyed,
Authority weakened, the person of the King put in hazard, and his restitution
(which they pretended) rendered more difficult, and endeavors used to break the
Union and Peace betwixt the Kingdoms, and to continue (so far as was in their
power) a lasting War betwixt this Kingdom and our neighbor Nation with whom we
are joined in Covenant.

This being the true estate of affairs, We did find it most necessary for us to
join in Arms together against these Covenant breakers and their Adherents who
had invaded England, and were disturbing the Peace of this Kingdom (and who
under a specious pretense of seeking the Kings Honor, Freedom and Safety, were
seeking their own Honor and base private ends, and have made the Kings
condition harder then ever it was before) this course being the only means
which was left us whreeby to endeavor the preservation of Religion, our native
Country, and the Peace and Union betwixt the Kingdoms, and our own Consciences
being ready to condemn us if we should sit still and suffer Religion to be
ruined, England to be further provoked (by detaining their Garrisons) and this
Kingdom to be enslaved and brought under the yoke of a perpetual bondage.

When we had put our selves in a posture for our own defense near Edinburgh,
the Earl of Crawford, the Earl of Lanerik, George Monro, and other Commanders
of the Forces joined with them, having marched to Inneresk, sent us some
Articles upon which they desired to Treat, for removeing all differences
betwixt us; but these Demands being very unreasonable and inconsistent with
Religion, the Covenant and Treaties betwixt the Kingdoms, We refused to admit
them to be the subject of a Treaty; yet were content if they had any other
thing to propound which might conduce to the settling of Truth and Peace
according to the Covenant, to appoint some from us to Treat with the like
number authorized by them, at any place equally distant from both Armies.
Whereupon they professed a readiness to have all differences ended by a
Treaty, that an intestine war might be prevented; but they assigned so short
Dyets for us to return our Answers about the necessary circumstances to be
agreed on before a Treaty could begin, as the time was elapsed before we could
be well conveened; and then they took the advantage of marching away, whilst
we continued in our Quarters in expectation of a Treaty, by which means they
gained the pass at Sterling, and surprised our Forces there, killing some, and
taking others Prisoners when they were in security being advertised that there
was a Treaty betwixt us; All this notwithstanding, so desirous were we of the
peace of this almost ruined Kingdom, as passing over all the provocations given
unto us, we readily entertained all proffers to Treat, and upon the 14. of
September, Commissioners on both sides met at Woodside, together with some
Ministers and Elders from the Commission of the Kirk; but after three days
debate that Treaty (during which their Army was grievously plundering the
Country) produced little else but delays, they refusing to accept of any
conditions without rewards for their service, Liberty to transport the Irish
Forces in a body to Ireland, security for their Lives, Estates, Honors,
Fortunes and places, and assurance that none who had been accessory to the late
Engagement should be questioned either by us, or by the Kingdom of England for
any thing done by them in relation thereunto, which was impossible for us to
grant without involving our selves in the guilt of the Engagement, and giving
occasion of quarrel against us to our neighbor Nation, in whose names we
could promise nothing without their advice and consent. And here we cannot but
remark, that these Lords and others, who in Parliament and otherwise, pretended
so great a zeal for his Majesty's Honor, Freedom and Safety, yet in all their
demands to us in this Treaty, they never made the least desire of any thing for
the King, but were ready to close an agreement with us when ever they could get
satisfaction in what concerned their own Honor, Freedom and Interest.

So soon as we understood that the Forces of the Parliament of England were
come to the Borders, for pursuit of the common Enemy, and reducing the
Garrisons of Berwick and Carlisle, We wrote a Letter from Falkirk to the
Commander in chief of these Forces, and sent two from us with Instructions to
acquaint him with the estate of our affairs, particularly our proceedings in
the Treaty, and to assure them that we would contribute our utmost endeavors
for the restitution of the Towns of Berwick and Carlisle to the Parliament of
England to whom they do of right belong: In return whereunto we received from
Lieut. General Cromwell a Letter to this purpose, That upon the defeat of the
Forces of the Duke of Hamilton they had received in command that they should
prosecute the Victory, until the Enemy were put out of a condition of growing
into a new Army, and the Garrisons of Berwick and Carlisle were reduced, in
pursuance of which commands they had resolved to advance into Scotland with
their Army for obtaining their Garrisons, and that the common Enemy might be
the sooner brought to a submission to reasonable conditions, withal engaging
themselves that so soon as they should know from us that the Enemy should yield
to these things we had proposed to them, and the Garrisons of Berwick and
Carlisle were delivered, they should forthwith depart out of this Kingdom: after
the receipt of this Letter, We sent some of our number with power and
instructions to do their utmost endeavor for obtaining the Towns of Berwick
and Carlisle to be surrendered to him for the use of the Honorable Houses of the
Parliament of England, and to represent our earnest desire and firm resolution
to preserve inviolable the Union betwixt the Kingdoms according to the Covenant
and Treaties; and since they had resolved in obedience to the Commands laid
upon them, to send Forces into this Kingdom for pursuing the common Enemy;
therefore to desire that those which should be sent might be such as would give
no offense or scandal to the Ministry and well-affected in this Kingdom.

Upon the 18. of September some Propositions were sent unto us from those at
Sterling, to which we returned an Answer upon the 20. And after a new meeting
at Kirklistoun with Commissioners from them, Articles of Agreement were drawn
up and subscribed by the Commissioners on both sides, which are now published
in print: In all which proceedings we have studied to set before our eyes the
Honor of God, and the good of Religion, the preservation of our Laws and
Liberties, and of the Union betwixt the Kingdoms. And to the end it may further
appear to this Kingdom and to all the World, that no sinister end or worldly
design for self-interest, has stirred us up to this course, we do declare.

First of all, that we have both matter of deep humiliation before God, and
thanksgiving to him when we consider his gracious dispensation toward us, in
preserving a remnant from following the evil courses of the time, and that he
was pleased so soon after a great defection and backsliding in the Land, to put
us into a condition to resist the force and fury of our Enemies, whom neither
Christian duty in so dear a Sunshine of the Gospel, nor natural affection to
their native Country, could restrain from horrid impieties and intolerable
oppressions. And we do freely acknowledge that it had bin just with the Lord to
suffer us to lie still under that yoke of bondage, which we had wreathed upon
our necks with our own hands, by compliance with Malignants and Malignant
courses, not trusting the Lord with his own work, and resting on his strength,
but following the rules of carnal policy, when ever we were brought into
straights. It is the desire of our Souls that for the future we may amend, and
it shall be our constant study, with Gods assistance, to avoid the rocks on
which we were ready to split, that we may neither upon the one hand put
confidence in the arm of flesh, and other wordly advantages when things are
prosperous, nor upon the other, comply with the Enemies of the cause when we
are low, but in all estates and conditions to put our trust in God Almighty,
the Lord of Host, who also is only wise to give Counsel.

Secondly, That whatsoever Power God has already, or shall hereafter put into
our hands, we shall improve it for settling and propagating Religion, and
promoting the work of Reformation according to the Covenant, and in particular,
to have the Liberties of the Kirk ratified, which have bin many ways incroached
upon and violated, as is particularly instanced in the Declaration of the
General Assembly.

Thirdly, To vindicate and establish the liberty and property of the Subjects,
who have bin most grievously oppressed in their Consciences, Persons and
Estates.

Fourthly, That we shall endeavor the Kings Majesty's Restitution to the
exercise of his Royal Power, as soon as he shall give security for settling
Religion in the manner expressed in the desires of the late Commission of the
Kirk, and shall give satisfaction in such other things as shall be found
necessary for the peace and safety of the Kingdoms.

Fifthly, That the late unlawful Engagement against our Neighbor Nation of
England, with whom we are joined in League and Covenant, may be disclaimed and
disavowed by the Supreme Authority of this Kingdom, it being most destructive
to Religion, and to the Peace and Happiness of these Kingdoms.

Sixthly, To strengthen and confirm the Peace and Union between the Kingdoms,
which the Malignant Party has so much endeavored to break and dissolve.

Seventhly, That we shall endeavor to purge out of all the Judicatories in the
Land, Malignancy and Profaneness, and use all other good means that Justice may
be equally and impartially administered to all the Subjects in the Kingdom, and
that a more effectual course may be taken throughout the whole Kingdom then
heretofore, for punishing and suppressing all Profaneness, Malignancy and
Impiety.

Eighthly, All means having bin used with great industry, to get Malignants
chosen to be Commissioners to the last Parliament, and to prepossess men's minds
when they came to the Parliament, from which as a Fountain have issued all our
troubles and distractions. That we will faithfully endeavor to have a free
Parliament, consisting of such persons as have not bin accessory to, and
furtherers of the late Engagement, for which end we do again hereby require
that in the Election of Commissioners from Buroughs and Shires to the
Parliament, the rules and directions set down in our Acts of the 22. September
last, and the fourth of this instant month of October, may be punctually
observed throughout the Kingdom.

And we call the searcher of hearts to record, that these are our real and true
intentions, and that we do not, nor shall by the Grace of God pursue any
private ends or interests of our own. And we trust, the Lord our God who
knows the sincerity of our resolutions, who has also had mercy upon us, and
has begun to do so graciously for us, will assist us herein until his work
shall be accomplished.

And now last of all, since it is agreed upon in the Treaty, that all questions
and differences about Religion be referred to the determination of the General
Assembly or their Commissioners, and that all Civil questions and differences
be referred to the determination of a Parliament, which is to sit down before
the 10. of January next: We do exhort and require all and every one of the
Subjects within this Kingdom, to live peaceable and quietly, and to wait
patiently for the determination aforesaid, but in case any shall not rest
satisfied with, or shall re^^le from the said agreement, and shall continue, or
rise in Arms, or levy any Forces without Warrant from the Committee of Estates
as it is now constituted, consisting of persons not accessory to the late
Engagement. We do declare that they shall be esteemed Enemies to Religion, the
King and Kingdom, and punished as wilful disturbers of the Peace of the Kingdom.

M. Thomas Henderson.

A short Declaration to the whole Kirk and Kingdom, concerning present Dangers
and Duties.
Edinb. 9. September 1648. Ante meridiem.
ALbeit the sad and dangerous condition wherein this Kirk and Kingdom is now
cast, by the public Resolutions and practiced of these who have engaged in War
against the Kingdom of England, do proclaim unto all the lowers of Religion and
the Country, what is needful to be done in this day of distress: Yet for the
better information of the Lords people, we conceive it necessary, shortly for
the present sent to declare what we hold incombent in duty to all these who
would not betray the cause of God, and render themselves slaves to the tyranny
and lust of ungodly and Malignant men, hoping in a short time to make known our
thoughts of these particulars more fully.

When the disaffected and prevailing party in the Parliament of this Kingdom
did manifest headstrong resolutions to make War upon England, under a pretext
of suppressing Sectaries; But in effect, to dissolve the Union betwixt the
Kingdoms, and to restore the King to the exercise of his Arbitrary Government,
and make way for promoving of the Designs of the Malignant party in both
Nations, just and necessary desires relating unto the grounds of an engagement,
and unto the securing of Religion, were presented unto their Lordships by the
Commission of the former General Assembly: But these desires were altogether
slighted, and an engagement resolved upon such grounds as are contrary to the
Word of God, and do infer the breach of all the Articles of the Solemn League
and Covenant, as is clearly holden forth in the Declaration of the last General
Assembly; wherein also may be seen the great encroachments that are made upon
the Liberties of the Kirk: Neither was there any regard had unto the dissent
and Protestation of a considerable number of Members of Parliament, who had bin
most active and straight in the Cause from the beginning; nor unto the
Petitions and Supplications of many Synods and Presbyteries, and of the well
affected people of the Land, who were seeking satisfaction to their
consciences: But instead of a satisfactory answer, the engagement which was
wickedly resolved, was violently carried on by most strange plundering and
cruel oppression, especially of these who did it upon no other ground then out
of fear to sin against God: And as though it had bin too little to force
obedience unto their unlawful Resolutions and Acts; the Committee of Estates
have urged and pressed the subscribing of a Band and Declaration of Parliament,
wherein men are obliged to acknowledge the justice and equity of all the Acts,
Conclusions and Resolutions thereof, or if they refuse, are to be esteemed
Eenemies to Religion and their Country: And after that the Committee of Estates
had sent such an Army unto England, as by the leaders thereof, was professed to
be so considerable, as was sufficient to prosecute their Resolutions in that
Kingdom, without any further supply of Forces from this: Yet they have resolved
upon, and prosecuted a new levy, with no less violence then the former, that
they may wreith the yoke of their oppression upon the necks of the Lords
people, and bring the whole Kingdom in flavery and bondage: And though the Lord
has declared his wrath from heaven aginst these their resolutions and
proceedings, by bringing their Army to so sudden and shameful on overthrow; yet
do they still adhere unto, and pursue the same designs, and have not only
brought within the bowels of this Kingdom the remnant of that godless and
profane Army, but have given Commission also to classed incendiaries and
Rebels who served under the conduct of James Grahame to raise Forces, and by
the whole tenure of their carriage, do make it appear to all who have eyes to
see, that they do intend rather to involve the Kingdom in blood, then to be
restrained in the persuit of their former wicked resolutions.

Therefore albeit the thoughts of peace be precious unto us, and that we wish
and exhort every one to follow peace with all men as much as is possible; yet
looking upon the eminent dangers that threaten Religion, the grievous
oppressions that lies upon the Lords people in their Consciences, Persons and
Estates, and the many fearful evils, that threaten both Kirk and Kingdom, if
the remnant of these men's wrath be not restrained: We conceive that all the
people of God are obliged and engaged by Covenant, with their Lives and
Estates, to endeavor and pursue these following ends, and to oppose all the
Enemies and Adversaries thereof; First, Because Religion is of all things the
most excellent and precious, the securing thereof is to be most in our
thoughts, and in the endeavors of all men, that it may be preserved unto us,
and transmitted unto our posterity, in purity. Secondly, All are bound to
defend and maintain the Liberties of the Kirk, which is the House of God, and
the ground and Pillar of Truth. Thirdly, All are bound to vindicate the
Liberties of the Subjects, in all these things which concern their Consciences,
Persons and Estates. Fourthly, There is no less obligation, carefully to
maintain the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, and to avoid every thing that may
weaken the same, or involve us in any measure of accession unto the guilt of
these who have invaded the Kingdom of England. Fifthly, All are to endeavor the
Kings Majesty's Restitution to the exercise of his Royal Power, as soon as he
shall give security for Religion, in the manner expressed in the desires of the
late Commission of the Kirk, and shall give satisfaction in such other things
as are necessary for the peace and safety of the Kingdom. Sixthly, All are to
take a more effectual course then heretofore, for punishing and suppressing of
all Malignancy, injustice, iniquity, profaneness and impiety, and to endeavor,
that the best and fittest remedies be applied for taking away the causes of
these evils, and advancing Religion and Righteousness in the ^^nd, and that
those men who have been formerly instrumental in our present miseries and
calamities, be not again admitted unto any such trust or power as may enable
them to involve the Land in the same or the like Evils.

These things are of such importance and consequence as that we know not what
can be expected without them but a continuance and increase of our present
miseries and calamities; And therefore seeing the Lord has now put into the
hands of his people such an opportunity, and made many willing in this day of
his power: We do exhort and beseech all men, throughout the Land, by the
mercies of God who has not given us over unto death, but left us a nail in his
holy place, that they would seriously mind, and to the utmost of their power
prefer these ends against all lets and impediments whatsoever, and oppose all
these who stand for the engagement. In the beginning of this work the Lord
stirred up the spirits of his people to join together and defend themselves
against tyranny and oppression in these things which concerned their
consciences and liberties; and albeit their power was but small, and the
strength of adversaries great, yet because they did their duty in the
simplicity of their hearts, and trusted in the name of the Lord, he was pleased
to make the enemies melt as wax before the fire, and to vanish as smoke before
the wind: And if after so many rich experiences of his assistance and rare
testimonies of his loving kindness, and great deliverances out of troubles and
solemn engagements by vows and Covenants, we should sit still, or comply with
those who have carried on the engagement in a time that threatens so much
danger unto Religion, and so iminent ruin to our liberties, persons, and
estates, we could not but be exceedingly guilty before the Lord, and deserve to
be plagued as betrayers of the cause of God, and of the safety both of Kirk and
State: Let us therefore arise, and do our duty, and the Lord of hosts, who has
already broken the power, and pride of our adversaries, shall be with us.

A Ker.

Articles concluded upon by the Officers and Soldiers, now in Arms by authority
of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland.
WE being servants to the State, and unwilling to engage in a civil War, do
conceive our selves obliged to remit the ways of prosecuting of all duties to
Religion, and to our King, to the determination of Church and State: And let
them move in it as they will be answerable to God: Our lives shall ever be
ready to be exposed to all hazards for the good of both; and if all duties for
them, and for our friends release in England, shall now be deserted, let the
blame before God and men lie upon the obstructors of it: And if no further use
be made of our service, We do demand,

1. That security be given to all, who are or have been engaged in this
service, for their Persons, Honors, and Estates, whereby they may be free from
all dangers, prejudices, and censures whatsoever, whether Ecclesiastical or
Civil, for their accession to the late Engagement, or any thing done by them
relating thereunto, or to this service for our own defense: And this to be
confirmed by Parliament, or the lawful Authority of the Kingdom.

II. That in regard of our extraordinary charges and loss; one Months pay be
instantly delivered unto us, for payment of the Irish Forces, and that Boats
and Ships presently be provided for their transportation into Ireland: And for
preventing all disorders upon their march through the West-Country by
Free-quartering, We do desire that a regular course may be taken for their
entertainment during their abode there, which shall be no longer then wind and
weather shall serve, and Boats be provided to transport them.

III. That one Months means be provided for the Scottish Forces* and that they
be not disbanded until the Irish Forces be transported; and that sufficient
pledges be delivered for performance of what is desired. And that our
disbanding and transportation be done by Authority of the Committee of Estates.

These reasonable demands being performed, We the Irish are ready instantly to
march toward any part of the West coast which shall be thought most fit for
our transportation into Ireland, and we of the Scottish, instantly to disband:
Otherwise, rather then expose our Lives and Fortunes to the mercy of any, by
the want of fitting assurances for what is past, or the loss of our Honors by
deserting the interest of those commanded by, or joined with us, We are
resolved to sacrifice our selves at the dearest rates we can; And take God to
witness how free we are of the guilt and consequences that may follow thereupon.

Stirling 18. September. 1648. We have appointed our Commissioners to stay no
longer then six o clock at night, to morrow the 19. and that the Treaty shall
then end; and that the Cessation shall expire eight hours thereafter, unless
the Desires beforementioned be fully granted.


Signed by Warrant and Command of the Officers now in Arms by the Authority of
Parliament, Jo: SPALDGUGE.

The Answer of the Noblemen and Gentlemen now in Arms for the Covenant, to the
Articles of the Officers and Soldiers that joined in the late unlawful
Engagement against England, and now continue in Arms to disturb the peace of
this Kingdom.
WE have considered the desires of the Officers and Soldiers at Sterlin, and
do return this answer; That the Imputation of neglecting duties to Religion and
to the King mentioned in the Preface to the Articles cannot be charged on Us,
who have never been wanting in the use of all lawful means, to prosecute the
ends of our solemn League and Covenant: But upon those who joined in
prosecution of the late unlawful Engagement against our neighbor Nation of
England, which has been destructive to all these ends.

Touching the first article, We referr you to the answer given in our former
papers, and do here again declare, that we shall not challenge, nor incite any
other to challenge any of your number for their lives and estates, but shall
endeavor to secure them so far as we can without approbation of their actions,
or the breach of Covenant and Treaties. As for that which concerns exemption
from Church Censures, we cannot meddle therein without breach of Covenant, but
must referr you to the Iudicatories of the Kirk, to whom you may make your own
address, and receive their answer.

Concerning the second and third articles, we refer you to the answer given by
our Commissioners to the Commissioners on your side, which was, that we held it
unreasonable that they should desire any thing from us, or any other who adhere
to us, for satisfaction of their Officers and Soldiers, because we will not
involve our selves in any thing which may import an accession to the late
engagement or may be the ground of a quarrel to England against this Kingdom;
but if they had real inclinations to Peace, they and their adherents might
without our accession thereunto take course amongst themselves for giving
satisfaction to their Officers and Soldiers, and therefore did desire (and do
now again renew the same) that all their forces, and the forces of these who
adhere unto them, may be disbanded betwixt and the twenty fifth, or at furthest
the twenty eight day of this month of September, and that none of them be
found together after that time, in Troops, Companies, or Regiments; and we
shall betwixt and the said day, disband all our Forces, and none of them after
that time shall, be found in Troops Companyes, or Regiments; for the
punctual performance whereof on both sides, mutual pledges are to be given;
and further we cannot say in answer to these articles.

If you shall not agree to the Desires made in our last papers of the 16 of
this instant, and not rest satisfied with these Answers, but shall continue in
Arms to the disturbance of the Peace of this Kingdom, and persist in the
courses in which you are now engaged, contrary to the Declarations of the
General Assembly and their Commissioners, we do hereby certify unto you, that
all who have been active in the late Engagement, as well chose in England as
those in this Kingdom, and all such as have or shall hereafter join with you,
are to be declared enemies to both Kingdoms; and that this Kingdom will be
necessitated to concur with the Kingdom of England for punishing them
accordingly as breakers of the Covenant and Treaties; and we leave it to you
seriously to consider whether the ways and courses you are upon, be really
for the good of the King and this Kingdom, or a safe way for the releef of your
friends that are prisoners in England.

We do declare that unless the Desires contained in our papers of the 16 of
this instant, and in this paper, be clearly and positively agreed unto, and we
advertised thereof before Friday the 22 of this instant, at twelve of the clock
in the day, that then the Treaty shall end, and that the Cessation from acts of
hostility and marching of forces shall expire eight hours thereafter.

September 20. 1648: Subscribed by command of the Noblemen and Gentlemen now in
Arms for the Covenant. Mr Tho: Henderson.

Edinburgh 22 September 1648.
Whereas many within this kingdom have joined in Arms for prosecuting an
unlawful Engagement against our Neighbor Nation of England, contrary to the
Solemn League and Covenant, and Treaties between the Kingdoms; the Warnings and
Declarations of the Commission of the General Assembly 1647. And likewise
against the unanimous proceedings and Declaritions of the late General
Assembly and their Commissioners. And whereas God has evidently manifested his
displeasure and wrath against their sinful ways and proceedings, in
oppressing the well-affected in this Kingdom, invading the Kingdom of England,
by Routing and Defeating their Army there: and now some of their Army have
returned to this Kingdom, and joined with others their associate to disturb the
peace thereof: By which their proceeding* and actions, the work of Reformation
of Religion has been almost wholly overturned, the Liberty of the Subject very
near destroyed, Authority weakened, the Person of the King put in hazard, the
union betwixt the Kingdoms endeavored o be broken, occasion of quarrel given
to our neighbor Nation, and this Kingdom b ought to so sad and deplorable
condition, as (if the Lord in mercy prevent not) Famine and Desolation is like
to be added to all our troubles and miseries. Therefore to prevent the

Edinburgh, 22. September, 1648.
THe Committee of Estates considering that the putting of the disaffected and
Malignant Persons in places of trust and power in the several Shires and
Burghs of this Kingdom, has been one of the greatest causes which has brought
all these evils upon this Kingdom; and for the reasons contained in the former
act, do therefore find it necessary to require; And do hereby Command and
require the several Shires in the Election of their Commissioners to
Parliament, and Burghs in election of their Commissioners to Parliament,
Magistrates and Counsel, that they make choice of none, but such as have
continued constant and faithful in this Cause: And that they will not admit
any to be in the former places of Trust, Commissions, Magistracy or Counsels
who have concurred in Arms or Counsel for the late unlawful engagement, or
who have subscribed the Bond, or sworn, or subscribed any Oath or Declaration
for prosecuting that engagement. And further that they will admit none who have
been aiding, or shall be aiding, or assisting to, or abetting and agenting for
these who are now joined in arms with the Earls of Crawford, Earl of
Glencairn Earl of Lanerk Lord Sinclair, Lord Register, George Monro, and their
adherents, nor any such as have, or shall declare their judgment against the
cause and our proceedings in pursuance thereof. And we ordain these Presents
to be published at the Merkat Cross of Edinburgh and other places needful:
