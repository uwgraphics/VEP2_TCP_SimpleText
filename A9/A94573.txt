TO THE PARLIAMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF ENGLAND London.
SHOWS,
THat whereas after a long Contest in this Poor Island against Tyranny and
Injustice (wherein the treasure of the Nation has been exhausted, and the
precious Blood of many thousands spilt, the Parliament being Necessitated to
spend their Time for many Years in maintaining the War, and providing for the
Defense of themselves, and such who Engaged with them in that quarrel) God
has been pleased (we hope in Mercy to the Nation) to bring You once again
together in a time of Peace, to heal our Breaches, to Establish firmly the
Ancient Rights and Freedoms of England, which were the subject of this great
quarrel (which God decided on our side) and to settle such ways of dispensing
impartial Justice, that the Name of God may be exalted in Righteousness, and
no man in the end have cause to repent of the Blood and Treasure expended in
the pursuance of the same.

Your Petitioners therefore humbly crave leave to present to Your Honors their
senfe of some of the principal things wherein that Tyranny consisted, against
which we did then in Judgment and Conscience Engage, which were

1. The late Kings Usurpation over Parliaments, Committing and keeping diverse
of their Members in Prison, as long as he thought good, without bringing them
to trial; In preventing their Meeting, and Dissolving them when they were met,
at Pleasure: His Denial and opposition of their Supreme Trust, to provide in
all things for the safety and welfare of the People, under pretense of a
Negative Voice.

II. The Challenging of such an Interest in the Militia, as to Command the same
at his Pleasure, without the Parliament, and to place the Subordinate Commands
of the same in whom he pleased: whereby he claimed a Power to enforce Obedience
to any of his illegal commands, both in matters Religious and Civil; which
directly tended to the razing out the very Name and Being of Parliaments,
which have been the Ancient Preservers of the Nations Freedom.

III. His Introducing and exercising of an Arbitrary Power by his Council and
others, over men's Persons and Estates, when they ought to have been tried by
the Laws of the Land.

IV. His assuming a Right (under pretense of Necessity for the Nations good,
and to secure it from future Attempts, whereof he only would be Judge) to
Leavy Money upon the People without their Consent in Parliament; wherein (as in
the Particulars aforesaid) he pretended he was unaccountable for what he did,
either to the Parliament, or any earthly Power whatsoever.

And your Petitioners do humbly crave leave to mind your Honors of the many
Signal Testimonies, which God has given of his displeasure against all who
have endeavored to support the aforesaid Tyranny, or have espoused it as their
quarrel, under any notion whatsoever: And of the price now put into your hands
to secure the Nation, from fu^ure attempts and dangers of the like Nature: And
not only the Armies Declarations, and the Agreement of the People, proposed by
them (remaining upon Record in your House) but the Ruins and Spoils of the
Land, and of the many thousand families therein: The expense of many Millions
of Treasure, the wounds and scars, and lost members of very many, and (above
all) the precious blood of such, who were slain in the quarrel, together with
the long waiting, earnest and patient expectation of many good people
(retaining in their hearts affection to the good old Cause) cry aloud to you to
call upon God with us for Wisdom, that you may be taught, and enabled to
establish such a sure foundation of Right, Freedom and Justice, that the
People of the Nation may not be put again upon such hazards of their Lives, and
expense of their Estates for the desence of the same.

Therefore Your Petitioners Humbly pray,

That together with the constant succession of Free Parliaments duly Chosen,
the Supreme Power and Trust, which the People (the Original of all just Power)
commit unto them, to make Laws, Constitutions and Offices for the Government of
the whole, and to call all Officers of Justice, and Ministers of State
whatsoever to account, may be so clearly Declared and Secured against all
attempts to the contrary, that no question may henceforth arise concerning the
same.

That the Militia may be settled with such Wisdom and full Security, that it
may not be in the power of any to make use thereof against the People, or their
Successive Parliaments either to destroy their Being, or their Freedom.

That no Money may be Leavied upon the People (on any pretense whatsoever) but
by their common Consent in Parliament.

That our Civil Wars being long since ended, the Peoples Persons and Estates
may be only subject to be disposed of according to the Laws of the Land; and
that henceforth none may be reputed Offenders, or proceeded against by
imprisonment, or otherwise, but such who shall be really found transgressors of
the Law: And that there may be speedy consideration had of the long
Imprisonment of many Persons well-affected (and some in remote places) without
any due prosecution: And we the rather press this, because it has been the
practice of former Parliaments, and in particular of the late Memorable
Long-Parliament, to take notice of, and redress the grievances of the People,
to relieve those who were illegally oppressed, and to restore them to the
enjoyment of Liberty, their common Birthright by the Law of the Land; which
the Lord has signally owned, and blessed from Heaven, and the good People have
abundantly rejoiced in.

That so long as it shall be judged Necessary to keep up an Army for the
preservation of the People from the attempts of the common Enemy, Domestic or
Foraign, the Officers and Soldiers who have hazarded their Lives for the
Nations Liberty, may not be turned out-of their respective employments without
a legal Trial at a Court-Martiall, that so the Military Power may be
preserved in the hands of such, who are not merely Mercenary, Newters, or
disaffected.

And that as the safety of our Religion is concerned in the Defense of our
Civil Rights, so such provision may now be made for the encouragement of the
sincere Professors of the same; that no tender Conscience may be oppressed.
And in doing these things you will be glorious Instruments in the hand of God,
and Honorable in your Country, And the Lives and Estates of your Petitioners
shall be freely exposed to hazard in your just Defense.

And Your Petitioners, etc.
