THat the Petitioners do with joy and humble thankfulness, acknowledge the
good correspondence and concurrence, which (by the blessing of God) this
Honorable House has held with the worthy House of Commons, in passing the
Bill, to take away the Votes of the Prelates in this Honorable House, and
disabling them from Temporal employments, and for setting the Kingdom into a
Posture of War for its Defense.

And the Petitioners do in like manner most humbly and heartily profess, that
they will ever honor this Honorable House, and to the utmost of their power
defend the same, so far as their Lordships shall continue to hold
correspondence and concurrence with the said House of Commons, in all their
just desires and endeavors, upon which, the Petitioners do humbly conceive,
greatly depends the peace and welfare of this Kingdom.

And the Petitioners most humbly pray, that this Honorable House, (declaring
therein your Noble Resolution for the public good) would be pleased to go on
with the said House of Commons to a through Reformation, especially of the
Church, according to the Word of God; to press dispatch of the Aid of Ireland,
to expedite proceedings against delinquents; to vindicate Parliament
Privileges; to discover, remove, and punish evil Counsels; to deprive the
Popish Lords of their Votes; to disarme and search out Papists, and put them
into safe custody; to suppress Mass, both in public and private; to cast out
scandalous Ministers; plant painful Preachers every where, and discover who
are Church Papists, as well as known Recusants.

And the Petitioners shall daily pray, etc.
