To The Right Honorable, the House of PEERS, now assembled in PARLIAMENT.
The Humble Petition of JAMES Archbishop of ARMAGH.
Humbly shows,
THat whereas your Lordships were pleased to employ your Petitioner in
preaching before you on the Fast Day, the 22. of December last: (which service,
according to his mean ability, he was careful to perform:) so it is, that one
John Nicholson, having got into his hands a collection of some rude and
incoherent Notes of that Sermon, took the boldness to publish the same (under
the Title of Vox Hiberniae) as a true Relation of that which was uttered before
your Lordships that day, Which being in many places void of common sense, and
in the whole every way unanswerable unto what was fit to have been delivered
before so Honorable and judicious an Audience, etc.

Die Veneris, 11. Februarii, 1641.
Ordered by the Lords in Parliament, That a Book concerning the L. Archbishop
of Armagh, being published and printed by John Nicholson, shall be called in
and suppressed.

JO. BROWN. Cleric. Parliam.
