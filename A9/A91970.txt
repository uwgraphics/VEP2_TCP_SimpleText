ROOM FOR CUCKOLDS: OR MY LORD LAMBERT'S ENTRANCE INTO SODOM and GOMORRAH.
To the Tune, Is there no more Cuckolds but I.
YOu Cowd-hearted Citizens,
What is your Damned pretense
To keep your selves within your Beds,
and not Fight for your Prince;
Whose Majesty should you behold.
your shames would breed your woe;
And then (like Fools) you will cry out,
Cuckolds all-a-Row.
There Is some of you have Bishops Lands,
do so much Clogg your Heels,
That now you cannot sturr, where as
else, you would Run on Wheels:
But yet I hope a time will come,
When you shall be made know,
And told unto your Faces, that you are
Cuckolds all-a-Row.
But yet for one most Reverend Act,
you are to be Commended;
That through your Rams-head Zeal you have
your Brother RVMP befriended.
To set them in the Parliament House,
Their Wisdoms for to show;
But they and you are all a like
Cuckolds all-a-Row.
Yet I advise you, set this Rump,
in Salt, for fear of Stinking?
'Twill fall unto the DEVILS share,
because it is his by drinking:
In spite of all their ACTS, and LAWS,
He Will carry them down below
Then HELL, and CITY like to like,
Cuckolds all-a-Row.
I doubt, your LAMBERT is undone,
and now he may go Preach;
For'ts the English all-a-moade,
For every Rogue to Teach:
He Will Nose it bravely in a Tub,
to let the CITY know
That they will be Damned unless they Dip,
Couckoldb all-a-Row.
But where is your mighty Fleetwood now,
His Honor's worn to the Stump;
He Will serve Ambassador to HELL,
to make way for the RVMP.
And thus KING-killers one by one
will to the Devil go,
Upon the CITY Asses backs, like
Cuckolds all-a-Row.
And now now Cow-hearts, look to your Shops,
the RED-COATS will you Fright,
And Plunder you, because they know
your HORNS hang in your Light:
No matter, for YOU have been the cause
of all the Kingdoms Woe,
And do deserve still to be called
Cuckolds all-a-Row.
But if that you will Honest grow,
and do a glorious thing;
Which is, to Rowse and take your ARMS
and Fight for CHARLES your KING:
Which ACT your Credits will regain,
and all the World shall know
That you no more shall, then be called
Cuckolds all-a-Row.
