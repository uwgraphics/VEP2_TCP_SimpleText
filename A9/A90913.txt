THE DECLARATION OF Col. POYER, and Col. POVVEL, and the Officers and Soldiers
under their Command, which they desired to be published to the whole Kingdom.

Wherein they declare their Intentions for Restoring His Majesty to His just
Prerogative, and the Laws to their due Course, for the maintenance of the
Protestant Religion, and the Liberty of the Subject:

Which was the Ground of their first taking up Arms, and for which they are
resolved to Live and Die.

April 10. 1648.

Printed in the Year 1648.

The Declaration of Colonel POYER, etc.
IT is notorious enough upon what grounds this War was by us undertaken; how
the faults of Government precedent were laid open and reformation promised,
wherein the true Religion should be advanced, the King made great and glorious,
and the just Privileges of Parliament, the Laws of the Land, and the Liberty
of the People maintained: But now how much our expectations have failed us, and
how we have run into those evils which we fought against, is at last too
apparent unto us, who would not at the first believe the things we now see,
insomuch that the Errors of the former Government, are now so far exceeded
both in Church and Commonwealth; that they are either justified, or at least so
much excused, as that it is desired by the most and best of men, rather to
enjoy the former again, then to suffer such a Reformation, wherein the
Public good is pretended, and the particular ends of the Reformers intended.

For although our Party have prevailed almost these three years, and the King
in the power of the Reformers almost these two years; yet the things promised
to be reformed, and which we fought for, are scarce so much as entered into, or
debated, but clean contrary things now acted.

The King instead of coming to his Parliament to treat personally with his
two Houses, imprisoned; instead of being made Great and Glorious, is become the
most unfortunate in the World, and great and glorious only in Piety, Patience,
and Pity: our Religion, Laws, and Liberties so much trampled upon, and
destroyed, and the greatest Tyranny, and Arbitrary Power set over us, that the
wit of man, or malice of the Devil can invent, and all this but to satisfy the
Avarice and Ambition of a few men, who by accusing their Brethren have already
gotten too much power into their hands, and do^ now labor to disband u^, not
to ease the Country (as is pretended) but as we are able to prove by their
own Letters and words to bring in other Forces, such as may execute their
Walls, and make the Gentry subject to Sequestration, inslawe the People, and (to
use their own words) Roll the Country before them: and to establish Excise,
Taxes. and other intolerable charges, not to be avoided, without the effusion
of more blood, then has yet been shed in this Quarrel, unless God of his
infinite mercy please to direct it by some means not appearing to us: And that
they might (as much as in them ^es) destroy our Souls as well as our bodies;
They go about to put down the Book of Common Prayer in these parts, as they
have already done in the rest of the Kingdom, which will be more wanted here,
then in other parts; because the Book of Common Prayer is the sole comfort of
the people here, and their way to attain the knowledge of the Principles of
Religion, and coser^^ God: these things though evidentin themselves, yet we
shat be ready to make pro^fe of, as occasion shall require: And therefore that
the whole world may see our integrity, as well in the undertaking this War in
the beginning, and our Carriage hitherto, as of our intentions for the future,
we do now declare:

That we do still continue to our first Principles, to bring the King to a
Personal Treaty with his Parliament with Honor, Freedom, and Safety, that so
the just Prerogative of the King, Privileges of Parliament, Laws of the Land,
and Liberties of the people, may be all established and preserved in their
proper bounds, that we will as much as in us lies protect the people from
Injury, and maintain the Protestant Religion, and the Common Prayer as it is
established by Law in this Land, and therefore crave the Assistance of the whole
Kingdom therein.

FINIS.
