TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE L. General Cromwell, AND The rest of the Council of
the Army OF THE Comonwealth of ENGLAND;
The humble and faithful advice of diverse affectionate Friends to the
Parliament, Army and Commonwealth of England.
HEaring of your especial meetings in Council in order to the settling of the
Nation in Peace and Freedom* as persons always engaged with you in affection
and endeavors to the same just ends, and alike concerned in the issue and
success thereof; and knowing by sad experience how prone the wisest have been
to mistakings in affairs of this nature, we have deemed our selves bound in
conscience to contribute what we conceive requisite, o^ may be of use for the
steering of your course aright, and for the avoiding of those rocks upon which
many have fallen for want of due and timely consideration: which cannot be
avoided but by a clear knowledge of the Fundamental Laws and Lib^^ties of
England, and by a firm resolution to restore every of them without pa^tiality
unto their primitive power and efficacy throughout the Land; notwithstanding
any corrupt interest, built upon their ruins or abuses.

So that waving all things of innovation (let pretenses be never so specious)
the first thing necessary to the work you have undertaken, is to satisfy your
understandings, what are those Fundamental Laws and Liberties, and in the
next place by all lawful means to endeavor their restoration. For, as you
once well argued, you are not a mercenary Army, hired to serve any arbitrary
power of State (such was the late Kings Army, fighting against the Fundamental
Laws, to erect his will or corrupt Laws by former Kings procured subservient
to will and power) but called forth and conjured by the several Declarations
of Parliament to the defense of your own and the Peoples just Rights and
Liberties, which our Ancestors of famous memory have endeavored to preserve
with the price of their blood, and you by that, and the late blood of your
dear friends and fellow soldiers (with the hazard of your own) do now lay
claim to; these are your own reasonings when first you disputed the Authority
of Parliament, they having first declined the Fundamental Laws, which was the
only just ground of declining them.

And as you rightly understood, that being no mercenary Army, but called forth
to the defense of your own and the Peoples just Rights and Liberties, you were
not bound to obey commands, though of a Parliament, contrary to the
Fundamental Laws, so much more now are you to understand, That of any men in
the world it would worst become you, to be either advisers or procurers of
other things then those very true ancient fundamental Rights and Liberties.

And you see likewise, that not withstanding the many professions and
Protestations of this Army, to maintain the Fundamental Laws and Liberties of
this Nation, it yet remains under a greater degree of bondage, and fuller of
just complaints then ever, because you have slackened your zeal, and there
has not been that diligent perseverance in all lawful endeavors until their
plenary restoration and firm establishment: Your study ought not to be like
Conquerors, to make things new, or innovate upon the Fundamental Laws (that
never-failing means of trouble and confusion) but to clear them from those
many encroachments, violations and abuses both upon the Laws themselves, and
the execution of them, which have almost rendered them of no benefit, and full
of vexation to the people of this Nation.

You may please to observe, it is not the being of a Parliament that makes the
Nation happy, but their maintaining of the fundamental Rights and Liberties,
nor that in words only and Declarations, but in the real and effectual
establishment of them; and when they either neglect those, or set up other
things contrary, or oppose the establishing of them, they prove themselves
enemies, and reduce this Nation into a condition of bondage.

Be pleased to review your Remonstrances and Declarations which in all parts of
them have held forth the clearing, settling and securing of the Rights,
Liberties, and peace of the Nation, the only justifiable end of all your
public motions and endeavors, appealing to the whole Nation, to the world,
and to Almighty God, for the justness, reasonableness, and common concernment
of your desires and intentions therein, yea so wisely careful were ye over the
common Rights and Liberties of the people, and of their safety, that you
proposed that in things clearly destructive to those Rights, there might be for
the future a liberty for dissenting Members in the Parliament to enter their
dissent, and thereby to acquit themselves from the guilt or blame of what
evils might ensue, that so the people might regularly come to know who they
are that perform their trust faithfully, and who not, an argument amongst
others then urged by the Army, importing the greatest zeal and sincerity, to
the restoring of the Fundamental Laws, that could possibly be expressed.

Nor is there (as we verily believe) any just objection, that should stagger
you in perseverance accordingly, although we cannot deny, but that all the old
and new Sophisms and delusive arguments devised by corrupt interests, in
defense of themselves against the Fundamental Laws and Liberties of the
people, have been so diligently blown abroad, that we find they have captivated
many good men's understandings, and are ready and uppermost almost in all
discourses, urging that if you now endeavor the restoration of the ancient
Fundamental Laws and Liberties of England, you seek to re-edifie the things
you have thrown down, as Kingly government, which the Parliament, not without
sufficient grounds, voted to be useless, burdensome, and dangerous; for what,
say they, has been more ancient in England, unto which even by the very Laws
were annexed large revenues, and extraordinary trusts, as the Militia, and the
like? what more ancient authority then the House of Lords, which by the very
Laws of England had Jurisdiction in appeals after Judgment, and both Kings
and Peers ever esteemed an essential part of Parliaments; the Bishops likewise
of long continuance, and very many Laws extant in favor of them.

But as truth is more ancient then error, and righteousness was before sin,
though error and sin have much to say for their antiquity, so is it answered
in these and the like cases; though Kings, and Lords, and Bishops have been of
long continuance, and have procured many Laws to be made in several times, by
Parliaments in favor of them, yet upon due examination it will appear, that
they are not of Fundamental Institution, no more then many other corrupt
interests, yet extant, which time after time have one made way for another,
until at length they got the sway of all things, sat themselves upmost in all
places, often times filled the seats in Parliament, and then made Laws in favor
of themselves, and each others interest, and in subversion of the Fundamental
Laws, endeavoring all they could utterly to root them up, and to b^ot the
knowledge of them out of all remembrance.

And therefore to find out what are truly Fundamental Institutions, you may
please to look beyond Kings, and as you pass them, you will perceive that
their original was either by force from without, or from confederacy within
the Land, that of their confederates they made Lords and Masters over the
people, created offices, and made their creatures officers for life, whereas
the true mark of a Fundamental Institution is only one years continuance in an
office, by which mark it is evident, that neither Kings nor House of Lords are
of Fundamental Institution, all true Fundamental Institutions ordaining
election to every office, which is another mark, and that by the Inhabitants of
the place where the office is to be exercised; and another special mark is,
that the main scope and intent of the office and business thereof, is of
equal concernment to the general good of all the people, and not pointed to
make men great, wealthy and powerful, all which undoubted marks exclude not
only Kings, and Lords, and Bishops, but many other interests of men in this
long enslaved and deluded Nation.

So that in removing these useless, burdensome and dangerous interests of
Kings, Lords, and Bishops, no violence at all has been done to the
Fundamental Laws and Liberties of England, but they are so far cleared and
secured from innovation, and many oppressions which attended them.

No^ (...) there ground for any to suppose, that in restoring the true ancient
fundamental Rights of England, there will be a necessity of maintaining any
the Courts in Westminster, or their tedious, burdensome or destructive way of
proceeding in trial of Canses, both Chancety, and the rest being in all things
(except the use of Juries) all of them of Regal institution except the Common
Pleas, which is so also, as to its being seated in Westminster: These have
sometimes been strengthened by Laws made in Parliaments, which were ever to
give place to Fundamentals, being indeed null and void, wherein any particular
they innovate upon, or are contrary unto then: All causes by the fundamental
Laws being to be decided and finally ended, past all appeal, in the Hundreds,
or County Courts, where parties reside, or where the complaint is made by
Juries, without more charge or time then is necessary, so that until the
Norman Conquest, the Nation never knew or felt the charge, trouble, or
intanglements of Judges, Lawyers, Attorneys, Solicitors, Filors, and the rest
of that sort of men, which get great estates by the too frequent ruins of
industrious people, which is another mark to know that all such are not of
fundamental institution, but Regal, and erected for the increase and defense
of that interest.

As for those defects which are many times observed in Juries, and some
inconveniences which ensue in some cases under other fundamental
Constitutions; it is to be noted, that there is not perfection to be expected
in any Government in this world, it being impossible for the wisest men that
ever were to compose such Constitutions, as should in every case warrant a just
event. Yet so careful have our Forefathers been, that the Laws of England are
as preventive of evil, and as effective for good, as any Laws in the world.

And for Juries, whatever just complaint lies against them, it does not relate
to the Constitution it self, (which Kings have often attempted to destroy, as
the main fortress of the peoples liberty) but against such abuses, in the
packing and framing of Juries, in their byassing or over-awing, by the servile
and partial Officers about the Courts, by the Kings Sheriff, or Undersheriff,
and other, by-ways, that others have found out; all which abuses are matters
of just complaint, and require rectification, and ought not to be made use of
as a ground of Innovation, or an argument against your fundamental
Constitution.

Others there are, who finding the great importance of Juries to preserve the
people's Liberties, and that through the sense that the people have thereof, it
will be but a vain thing to attempt the total taking them away, have invented
a stratagem that will render them instead of being a fountain of equal Justice
to the people, the means only of advancing the rich, and an awe upon the middle
and meanersort of men, which they would do upon the middle and meanersort of
men, which they would do upon the common pretense of Prerogative, that only
men of estate and quality ought to be entrusted with the determination and
decision of causes, and therefore have contrived that such only as are worth
one hundred mark per annum, should be capable of being chosen Jury men, which
if obtained, we cannot from thence but make these conclusions.

1. That the Fundamental Constitution is thereby violated, which gives equal
respect to all men, paying Scot and Lot in the places they inhabit.

2. By the same liberty they alter the Constitution in this particular at this
time, they may at another time totally take it away.

3. That it is a policy agreeable to that of Kings, in reducing the power of
Judgment into the hands of a few, and the rich, who may with much more ease be
corrupted, then the generality: It being also a bringing of this Nation to the
condition of the French, and making it consist only of Gentleman and Pesants.

You may be pleased in the next place to consider the particular of Pressing,
or forcing men to serve in the wars against their consents, then which
nothing is more contrary to fundamental liberty; the King did always make use
of it, and such abroad, whose government has not that goodness and freedom
in it, as to invite men voluntarily to its defense; a good government cannot
need it, since in that it would be the interest of every man to hazard his life
and fortunes for its conservation, and therefore we desire that this ancient
liberty may be tenderly preserved.

For Tithes, they may (we conceive) be taken away, without violence to any
fundamental Law; the institution there of being Popish at first, and partly
Regal, afterward changed solely into the Regal Interest, to maintain a
numerous sort of ble Sophisters, under pretense of being Ministers of Christ
(which they were not) having no qualifications agreeable unto those which were
so indeed, to preach up the Regal Interest with their own: Fundamental
institution imposes no charge upon the people, but for maintenance of the
impotent and poor, or for such as are restrained until time of trial for want
of Sureties: All which the Neigabourhood is to levy, or for public defense
against enemies, which is referred by Fundamental Constitution unto annual
chosen Trustees in the Grand Council of the people, called from the Norman
Parliament, upon whom the continued labors and policies of the Conquerors
successors have had great influence, by whose endeavors this burden of Tithes
came to have the color of Law set upon it, though in this, as in all things
else, Parliament of Law was ever to give way to Fundamental, being null and
void in it self, where it innovates upon the ancient Rights of the people, and
has been so acknowledged, enacted, and declared by most Parliaments; of so
Supreme Authority in this Nation have fundamentalls ever been, where of
Annual new elected Parliaments is one and a chief, being instituted for
preservation, and not for destruction of fundamentalls, for then it might null
Parliaments themselves, which could never be within the trust of Parliaments.

But yet so unhappy have Parliaments been in mosttimes since the Conquest, that
waving their care of the fundamental Liberties of the Nation, they have so
multiplied Laws upon Laws to their prejudice, that the whole voluminous bulk of
the book of Statutes serves but as a witness of their defection, and of the
prevalence of the Regal interest and his adherents; of which deviation from
their rule (the Fundamental Law) not any one thing is more remarkably
pernicious to industrious people, then this of tithes, or enforced maintenance
for Ministers, or any other sort of men, except such as are aforementioned; so
that tithes being utterly abolished, the people are delivered from a most heavy
and grinding oppression, and therein restored to Fundamental Liberty.

And as for those Laws which have been, touching men's Judgments, opinions and
practice in matters of Religion, with the proceedings thereupon, and
punishments annexed, there is no ground at all for them, the Fundamental Law
of England being as free and clear from any such persecuting spirit, as the
Word of God is; questioning none, nor permitting that they should be
questioned, or otherwise molested, much leise punished, but for such things
only, as whereby some other person is injured, in person, goods, or good name,
or in wife, children, or servant; and therein also it provides, that none be
tortured upon any occation whatsoever, and that no less then two lawful
Witnesses are sufficient to prove every fact: Also, that where any accused
person ^a^ Procure Sureties, there be no restraint of the body in person; what
is in common practice contrary hereunto, has been innovat^d contrary to
Fundamental Right, and may lawfully be reformed and reduced to its original
state again, and thereby also the people restored to ancient right therein, and
freed from abundance of mischief and inconvenience.

And so extremely does the Fundamental Constitutions of England regard true
freedom, that it allows of Bail in any case, without exception, where it can
be obtained, and admits no imprisonment of the persons of any for debt,
choosing rather that one man should sufter in his estate, then that the bodies
of men and women should be, as it were, buried alive in goales and prisons, as
thousands have been, and still are, to the hearts grief of all tender hearted
people.

But then the fundamental Law provides, that where there is any estate, there
satisfaction is to be made, as far as it will reach, leaving still some
necessaries for life, otherwise it were more grievous for poor debtors, then
for many sorts of wilful malefactors; for however the present practice is, and
long has been, by the fundamental Law, the estate even of a capital offender
that suffers death for his offense, is not forfeited, but descends to his
family, as other men's, after satisfaction made to the parties damnified: These
forfeitures no doubt have been the principal cause that many an innocent man's
life has been unjustly taken away, and many a worthy honestman come to be
burned in the hand; and however Parliaments have been drawn in to countenance
such practices, it was the invention of Kings to turn families apside down at
pleasure, for to them their forfeitures went, and they gave them to their
creatures and Sickovants, so that here you see is work enough for a well-minded
Parliament to remove these evils, and to restore our rights in these and many
other ^d particulars, without interchanging or innovating upon the true Law of
England.

The most unreasonable descent of inheritances to the eldest son only, is
also no part of the Fundamental Law, but quite contrary thereunto, that
honestly and conscionably provided, that all inheritances should descend to all
the children alike, choosing rather that some ill-deserving children should have
where they deserve not, then that it should be at the will of parents, or in
the power of the Law, to expose many to such inconveniences, and destructive
courses, which younger brothers for the most part has been cast upon: Diverse
other branches there are of the Fundamental Law, as is that concerning Juries,
the Liberty of Exception against thirty five, without showing cause, and of as
many more as cause can be justly alleged against, until the party does
evidently see an indifferency in his Tryers, As also to admit no examination of
any against themselves, nor punishment for refusing to answer to questions, Nor
conviction without two lawful Witnesses at the least; and that it is the duty
of the Officer of the Court to declare to every person these his Rights, and to
bring them to remembrance, if neglected to be demanded; all this shows that
the Fundamental Law of England is a Law of Wisdom, Justice and much mercy,
such as God will bless, chosing in all cases rather that some guilty persons
should sometimes escape, then that one innocent person should causlesly be
condemned.

And whereas it has been supposed, that the punishment of theft by death is
fundamental, it is a mere mistake, it, as most other like things, being an
innovation, and no way tending to the lessening of offenders, but rather to
their increase, and indeed necessitating, or strongly tempting every one that
robs, to murder also: For as the practice long time has been, one witness
even of the party himself that is robbed suffices for proof, and casts the
thief for his life, what way then is more safe for the thief, then to murder
whom he robs, to prevent his testimony against his life, seeing he dies, if
proved a thief, and can do no more if proved a murderer? Besides, when the
Fundamental Constitution was in force, it punished offenders according to the
nature of their theft, some by pecuniary inulcts, others by corporal
punishments, with laborious workings and open shame, at which time it is
testified, that a man with much money, or moneys worth, might have traveled in
safety all over England with but a wh^ ^d in his hand; besides, the Law of
death for theft is many times the means why robbers escape, for that many good
and tenderhearted people, either upon the consideration abovementioned,
decline prosecution, because if they should prosecute, they must either swear
falsely, and undervalue what they lost, or take away life, where in conscience
they judge they ought not; all which would not be, were the punishment
proportioned to the offense, as in the Fundamental Law it is.

As much likewise may be said concerning the servile tenures of Copyholds, how
long soever they have been, they are the slavish remains of conquest,
inconsistent with true freedom, or the Fundamental Law of England, and may,
and as the rest forenamed, ought to be reduced to the true state of ancient
right, and the people thereby freed from abundance of torment, and vexation of
Spirit.

All Monopolies at home, and all restraint of trade abroad to distinct
companies of men, are all opposite to the ancient rights of the people, and may
justly be reduced to a universal freedom to every Englishman, which will make
trade in time to flourish, and wealth and plenty of all necessaries to abound,
especially if the way of raising money by custom and Excize were laid aside,
being utterly destructive to trade, and rendering the lives of tradesmen tedious
and irksome to them, and has no consistence with Fundamental right; for
according to that rule, no imposition ought to be laid upon trade, but what
moneys are at any time found needful by Parliament, ought to be levied by way
of Subsidy, or an equal proportion upon all men's estates, real and personal,
in which course the whole, within two pence or three pence in the pound, is
brought into the public treasury, whereas in the other way, vast sums go to
the maintenance of Officers, so as you perceive in this and all other
particulars hitherto recited, the most ancient right is not only due, but most
for the case and good of the people, you may perceive by what has been
expressed what are our ancient rights, and what, how many, and how great have
been our almost as ancient wrongs and oppressions.

Some of our ancient rights remain alive to this day, as Parliaments and Juries
the first of which ought annually to be chosen, which annual choice has for
many years been intermitted, and that inherent right withheld, which should
have some special thing for its excuse, and happy were the people, and
doubtless happy would it be for this present Parliament also, that it may
truly be said they held the Parliamentary power so long, that they might
restore the people to their ancient native rights, the Fundamental Laws, to
their full force and power, for which end it was, as you declared, that you
reserved these, when you excluded the rest; and therefore surely in this and
many more respects you are obliged to persevere in putting them in mind
thereof, and if you find that they are not able to agree in the performance of
this, the proper work of Parliaments then to move them in some short time, to
order a new Parliament to be chosen, that they may take place of them, it being
in no wise safe for the Parliament to dissolve, until the new immediately
ready to sit when they rise; nor would we for any thing in the world, that
Parliaments should be accustomed to be forced, nothing being of more dangerous
consequence to Government it self.

Which endeavors and desires we shall be ready to second you in, and we trust
you will not omit to do it by way of Petition with all possible speed, that the
desires of good men may be satisfied, in seeing this Parliament yet honor
themselves, and bless the Nation with the proper fruit of their so many years
labor, hardship and misery, the re-injoyment of their birthright; Or if that
cannot be obtained, you and your friends desiring it, they will not defer to
give up their trust into the hands of another Parliament, which when you
understand, we shall then desire you to acquaint the people what their ancient
rights are, and how and by what interests of men they have been withheld from
them, that so they may at length beware, and not choose such men to make them
free, whose interest, advantage, and way of living, binds to keep them in
perpetual bondage: And to inform them likewise, that it is not Statute Law,
nor the opinion of Judges, and book-cases, nor the Prerogative of Princes,
Lords, and great ones, nor anything but their Fundamental Rights that can
render them free or happy, and to persuade them no longer to give ear to such
charming as has been to their bondage and misery: And that you will be as
strongly provided against all motions of Innovation, as against the worst of
enemies, though they should assail you with seeming arguments from Scripture,
the Scripture giving no particular rules for the Government of Nations, the
Government of the Israelites being only intended for them, and either binds
nor, or else it binds in all and every part; so as those who require tithes by
that Law, or punish some offenses according to that Law, are bound also to
circumcise, and to offer Sacrifice, and indeed to fulfill the whole Law, none
having power to make choice of one part, and refuse another.

If they urge from the Gospel, that indeed gives most blessed rules for faith
and conversation, but as to Government, it is apparent from those words of our
Savior, ( who made me a divider of inheritances) that the Gospel intends not
so much earthly, as heavenly things; but both old and new Covenants agree in
this, that all just agreements and contracts amongst men, (such are our
Fundamental Laws) ought inviolably to be kept and observed.

The sense of the Law of God is clear in this, that it is a cursed thing to
remove the landmarks of forefathers; nor are any more highly approved of by
God himself then the Rechabites, for walking sted fastly in the laws and
constitutions of their forefathers.

Nor can any thing be more destructive to Government or humane Society, then
for men to admit that they are not obliged to observe the Fundamental just
Institutions of the country wherein they were born, there being nothing that
tends so readily to the shaking of a well-bounded society of men into anarchy
and confusion: For, what is it that gives any man propriety in what he has but
Fundamental Law? What is it else that defends propriety, but Fundamental
Legal Power? Why have you, and we, and thousands more so cried out upon such
as pretended a Prerogative above Fundamental Law, and above Parliaments, but
that it was in subversion thereof? Why did our Forefathers and all their
posterity, down to our selves, so heavily complain against the withholding of
Parliaments, and against trial of Causes by any other way but by Juries, but
that they are both Fundamental? Why was it always noted as a mark of regal
prevalencie in Parliaments when any thing passed there contrary to those
ancient Rules? Why upon all complaints of oppression are the amendments always
made by that Rule, as that when Parliaments had been deferred, and complaint
made, the remedy runs thus: For remedy of grievances and mischiefs which daily
happen, a Parliament shall be chosen once every year according to Law: where
it is evident, the Law was more ancient then the Act of Parliament or amendment.

Also after abuse and innovation in trial of Causes the amendment comes and
says, That no man shall be attached, fined, imprisoned, exiled or deprived of
life, limb, liberty or estate, but by Iuries, according to the Law of the Land:
Which shows the Fundamental Law to have been time out of mind before Magna
Charta or any Statute Law. Why when after judgment in the legal Courts, the
Chancery and Parliament had taken cognizance of the same Causes by way of
appeal, does the amendment come and say, henceforth after judgment in the
legal Courts the parties shall be in quiet and free from being called either
into Chancery or into Parliament, according to the Law of the Land, but in
respect to the supremacy of Fundamentalls? Why were Petitioners in former times
so careful not to insert the least syllable contrary to the Fundamental Law,
but that they knew Parliaments were chiefly ordained for their preservation?
And it will not be thoroughly well in England, till Parliaments make answer to
Petitioners according to the Rule of the Fundamental Law. The late
Worcestershire Petitioners for Tithes may then know what they may justly expect
from them, viz. that they are at liberty either to give or pay tithes, or any
other proportion of their incombs, to such whom they will contract with for
their labors in teaching divine things, or any other kind of learning, but
those that approve not of paying, are not to be enforced; and thus in all
things are the English free, wherein their neighbor is not violated.

Had this rule been observed of late years, it had e're this stopped the mouths
of many Petitioners, and begot a better understanding amongst the people, who
have been shattered into shivers for want of this principle to unite them,
every man stirring and contending as for life for his own opinion; one will
have the Parliament do this, another that; others gathering themselves together
in knots, and boasting how many hands they had to their petition; a second sort
of men to theirs, and so of the rest, how many friends they had in the House
for this thing, how many for that; and thus like the builders of Babel, they
have been divided for want of knowledge, and fixednesse in and upon the
Fundamentalls, which only can give rest to the spirits of the English, the
goodness whereof having been once tasted, would soon beget a reconcilement;
and doubtless this way or none must come the true and lasting peace amongst
our selves, and by this means only can we ever be made considerable, either
against obstinate corrupt interest at home, or against foraign pretenders and
enemies abroad, who otherwise observing us to be a floating unbalanced people,
and consequently divided and subdivided within our selves, will never cease to
disturb this Nation; whereas were we once again bound and knit together with
this just and pleasant ligament of fundamental Law, divide and reign, would
not be so frequent in their vanquished mouths, which indeed is the main ground
of the hopes.

Consider we beseech you, how uncertain the rule of prudence and discretion is
amongst the wisest and best of men, how unstable that people were that should
be every year to make their Laws, or to stablish them, have we not found the
Proverb verified, So many men, so many minds; this thing voted by one sort of
men as most just and necessary, yea men's estates, and lives, and consciences
cast upon it, and those the best of men, when in short time after the same
voted down as most unjust and pernicious; infinite instances of this kind we
doubt not will come to your remembrance, and therefore not without good cause
have our Predecessors given such dear respect to their Fundamental Rights,
that unless men's understandings were even bewitched with the sallaries of
corrupt interest, they would choose rather to lose their lives, then to part
with one of them, esteeming every man, though born in England, no more a true
Englishman, then as he maintained the Fundamental Liberties of his Country.

To conclude, none ever yet denied that we had Fundamental standing Laws, and
such as against which no Statute Law ought to be obeyed; but endeavors you
will find have been in all ages for powers to establish themselves, and govern
by discretion; upon a pretense of more easy and speedy dispatch of justice, as
the late King did, when he by power brake up the short Parliament; before this,
he publicly declared, that he and his Lords would with more speed and better
justice redress the grievances of the people, then the Parliament could do.

And though this has been a disease incident to the strongest to give Laws,
and enforce them upon the people, yet as it is manifestly against the
Fundamental Rights of the people or England, which you have professedly fought
to restore, and not to destroy, having conquered their enemies, not their
friends, so have you by declarations laid grounds against such temptations; and
as abhorring all such wicked and unjust intentions, would not have any
entertain any such suspicion of you; we have very great hopes, that as you will
carefully preserve your hands. your strength, and power from being defiled, by
imposing Innovations, or continuing such as have been brought upon us, or yet
by being isntrumental to such as would, so we trust, and earnestly entreat
that you would lay the premises to heart, and by wisdom and perseverance,
procure the ancient good Laws of England to be re-established amongst us, they
being so just, so merciful, so preservative to all peaceable minded people, so
unburthensome to the industrious, so opposite to all self-interest so
corrective of any manner of wrong, so quick in dispatching, so equal in the
means, so righteous in their judgments, proportioning punishments to
offenders, so tender of the innocent, so consonant to right reason, and having
no disproportion to all true Christian doctrine, that the goodness of them, as
well as because they are the ties, the Bonds and Ligaments of the people, and
both your and our Rights and chief inheritance, we trust will cause you, like
the true sons of your worthy and valiant Ancestor, to be enamored of them, and
to be now much more of the same mind, then when you professed that you esteemed
neither life nor livelihood, nor your nearest relations, a price sufficient to
the purchase of so rich a blessing, that you, and all the freeborn people of
England might sit down in quiet, under the glorious administration of justice
and righteousness, and in full possession of those Fundamental Rights and
Liberties, without which we cannot be secure of any comfort of life, or so much
as life it self, but at the pleasure of some men, ruling merely according to
will and power.

And may the integrity of your hearts so appear in all your actions, as may
render you well pleasing in the sight of God, who has registered all your Vows
(of freeing this Nation from all kinds of bondages) in the days of your
distress: Keep therefore your hearts faithful; As Moses, who when he was to
lead the Israelites out of Egypt, would not leave a hoof in bondage: and in so
doing only, will you be the rejoicing of this Nation to all generations.
