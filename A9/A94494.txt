To the Honorable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, in this present
Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the High Sheriff, Knights,
Esquires, Gentlemen, Ministers, Freeholders, and Inhabitants of the County of
Sussex.
Humbly Shows,
THat your Petitioners having suffered in as deep a nature, both in our
Religion, Laws, Estates, and Liberties, as the many thousands of our Brethren,
who have already made known their condition to this honorable Assembly:
Notwithstanding we cannot but thankfully acknowledge the benefits which we have
received already by your unwearied labors, faithful endeavors, and undaunted
resolutions against all delays, desperate plots upon your Persons, Estates,
and Liberties; many heavy takes we are eased of; much freedom we enjoy in our
consciences and livelihood; defending us from the violent cruel^ies, and
sormidable power of the Prelates and their Courts, making good our Laws
against Treasons and evil Counsels, maintaining the true Religion and the
glory of it, maugre the endeavors of Arminians, Bishops, ill affected Clergy
and others, and the distructive plots of Papists, and the power of Popish
Lords; opening the mouths of faithful Ministers long since silenced,
enlarging those who were in prison and exile; appointing Lievtenants of trust;
providing relief for distressed Ireland, the crying object of Pity, and
subject of our enemies cruelty, our humble desires are above all,

That the Laws of God be truly maintained; Government and Discipline so
settled, that we may conform therein, to the perfect rule of Gods Word; able,
learned, and painful Ministers may be encouraged, scandalous speedily
displaced; Pluralities and unwarranted orders and dignities of the Clergy taken
away; that the probates of Wills and Testaments, may be reserved to the
cognizance of the Temporal Courts; that places of concernment in the Kingdom,
may be in the hands of Persons of integrity and good conversation; Papists may
be totally disarmed, the Persons confined, the subtle conveyances of their
estates discovered, and prevented; secret evil Counsels and Counselors taken
away from His Majesty; Delinquents punished; sail of Honor, and Offices
restrained: That our County more then seventy miles, naked to the Sea, may
speedily be put into a posture of warlike defense by Sea and Land; Seamen
encouraged; fishing maintained; Ireland farther relieved; the Clergy, and
others disobeying your late Orders in our Cathedral, and other Churches
questioned; the Universities thoroughly purged; the Mass utterly abolished.

For the perfecting of which, and all other your Honorable endeavors, that
the glory of God may be by your zealous and loyal intentions propogated, The
honor and safety of His Majesty and His Kingdoms advanced, the Privileges
of Parliament, and every Member thereof maintained, we shall never be wanting
with our prayers, lives, and Estates, according to our Protestation to give you
our uttermost assistance.
