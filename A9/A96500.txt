Mr SERGEANT WILD His Speech in the Honorable House of Commons, the 32. of
May, in the Cause of Mercurius Britanicus.
WE related unto you in our last work, the two, (or both) the Houses were
totally or wholly busied all day, (or from Morning till Night) concerning what
rewards Mercurius Britannicus was worthy to have, for his serviceable,
laudable, and indefatigable paines-taking, in his weekly writings for the
Parliament, where many of the House of Commons, were of opinion, that the
Gentleman had deserved well, but there was no resolved or settled resolution
amongst them, what to determine of him; where contrary to the wisdom, wit,
sense, reason, and inclination of the House, the Grave and Ancient Knight (Sir
Benjamin Ruddyard) only opposing, and bitterly inveighing against him, (as we
have truly related in our former occurrences of the 31. of April last) where
that important business was left to the discretion and censure of the House.
So that this day the matter being again renewed and debated on, Mr Sergeant
Wild, was appointed to plead in the ease of Britanicus, who like a second
Cicero, or a double demie Demosthenes, declared himself both a Learned
Advocate, and an Eloquent Orator as follows.

RIght Honorable, and most constant Conscript Patriots, if the worth and
merits of the Gentleman in whose cause I speak at this time, be well weighed
and considered, the speech of an Advocate would be superfluous, and time being
so precious as it is, this Honorable Assembly might employ it in more
necessary and urgent occasions. But when a person so high deserving, is
malignantly traduced, and the Magnificent Beneficence of your unparalled
gratitude to noble endeavourers, and studious paines-takers, so transcendently
calumniated, it is then high time to speak, if his own deserts were tonguetied,
dumb, mute, silent or speechless.

I have read in he voluminous collections of Mr Samuel Purchase, (entitled
Purchase his Pilgrimage) of the Kingdom of Bornea in the East India: The King of
that vast Region (although he be a Prince of mighty unlimitable Potency, for
Territories, Men, Arms, Ammunition, Artillery and Money) yet the safest and
chiefest trusty guard for his person, is a Regiment of Dogs, those Dogs are
his only Lifeguard, in whose serviceable fidelity, his Majesticall sequrity
does totally consist. This Canicular allusion, is not impertinent to my
following, or subsequent interlocution. For though a man has not the shape or
appetite of a Dog, yet no man has cause to be ashamed to imitate a Dog in
fidelity to his Master. Call to your remembrance (I humbly beseech you) that
the Reverend Preachers, and Learned writers of eloquent persuasive Pamphlets,
and weekly news have not played the parts of dumb Dogs, but with their
vigilant and violent barking, snarling and byteing, they have (with an Vlissean
emulation and imitation, been more powerful, then the strongest Ajaxian Army
or Sword in the gaining of the seavenfold shield, and divine tempor'd Armor of
the most valiant Achilles with his multitude of Mirmidons.

It is apparent that had it not been for the perpetual supportation, that this
Parliament has had, by the happy means of those famous Lecturers, and Learned
Writers, the Kings party had long since prevailed, and the Protestant Religion
had flourished and been maintained amongst us, in spite of our teethes. But
they, (and none but they are the chief Propps, Pillars, Ministers, and
Instruments, that have both built, framed, erected, and upheld, the
unparalled Geometrical fabric of all the Mighty unexampled achievements,
which (to our lasting renown) we have accomplished, and may happily proceed
in: for these men, have not only fully engrafted the People, with a constant
belief of us, that our consultations are unerrible, our judgments infallible,
our decrees unalterable, our opinions immutable, our power impregnable, our
force invincible, and all our Actions unquestionable; by which means, they
have continually furnished us, with means and maintenance defensive and
offensive, of Men, Money, Shipping, of all the Kings Houses, Strengths,
fortresses, and Revenues, and finally of any thing, and all things whereby we
subsist.

Amongst the many and numerous Multiplicity of those famous Authors, the
industrious and acute Mercurius Britanicus, has bin, and is the Atlas of our
foundation, and the Top-galiant of our felicity. Who has so vehemently reviled
the King, who has more contumeliously railed against the Queen, who has more
Learnedly scandalized the Peers, who has more Religiously abused the
Protestant Religion, who has more piously scandall'd the Common-prayer-booke,
who has so Reverendly vilified the Clergy, who has more violently slandered
the Kings Servants, who has more Wittily bejeer'd the Cavaliers, and who has
more prettily run the hazard of a Gregorian danger then he? And all these
services he has done for us, for which my opinion is, that we cannot do too
much for him.

I must confess the rest have done well, but as there are degrees (as our
Logicians say) of Good, Better, and Best, so that though Mr Booker, M. Nigh, and
M. Lilly, have done most Excellent-ly, Astronomical-lye, Astrological-lye,
Mathematical-lye, and Chronological lie, in their infusing into the Peoples
credulity, the predictions and pretendings, of Auspitious and Parliamentall
Proditorious Events; wherein if the Stars and Planets have either not kept
touch (or promise with them) or that betwixt the Constellations, Revolutions,
and Influences of the Celestial Orbs, Spheres, and Hemispheare^, and the
Terrestrial Globe there is such distance, that intelligence may fail,
messengers may meet with some Malevolent disasters, Letters may be intercepted,
and many impediments may chance to alter and change the conclusions, that such
Astronomers do ground upon, as it did with M. Booker, when his pretenses failed
in the taking of Oxford, with two Armies the 29. of May last 1644. although all
our Labor was not then lost, for with the dropping down of no more then 700
of our men, we saw Oxford, and Conquered a Mill four miles from thence, and we
also took two Carts, laden with Bedsteads, joyn'd-stooles, Washing-bolles, and
Bucking-tubbs. Concerning Captain George Wither, it cannot be denied, but he
has approved himself to be the Cream of Wisdom, the Lees of Wit, the Pith,
Marrow, and Marrow-bone of Invention, for our sakes, cause, and defense, he
has mounted the two top'd Pernassus, pumped at Hellicon, and drained the
Thespian fountain, he has Ransacked the Muses, rifl'd the Furies, Plundered
the Devil, and Raked Hell, and all this he has done for our services (as his
Learned volumne called Campo-Musae will testify. As for the Scowte, the
Scottish Dove, the Post, Mercurius Civicus, the Diurnalls, Occurrences, Weekly
News Books, and other Aids, Helps, and Assistants, It must be gratefully
acknowledged, that their Labors have bin prevalent, against the Malevolent,
though not Equivalent to the most meritorious Mercurius Britanicus.

What though Tailor the Thamesissian Aquatican, Humidian, Hydromantian and
Hidropican Poet, has smatteringly sputter'd at his fame, and most
Amaritudanically dissected and Embowell'd his Reputation; Though many of our
Malignants, have mounted their Penns against him, as we have done our Cannons
(or the Kings) against we know (and know not) whom: yet nevertheless, Hopes
Anchor has Moar'd him, Fortitudes Pillar has supported him, Perseverance has
spurred him forward, Opportunity has been his Handmaide, and old Time
(himself) has not disdained to wait on him, as a Page, or (as the Proverb
says) a TO Anthony Pigge. So that for our Service, Honor, and dignity, he
has been more violent and vigilant, then all the rest of the Pack; Therefore
to put an end, to finish, to make a conclusion, to come to a full point, to
shut up all with a Period, and briefly (to avoid Tautology) in a word, to speak
faithfully and fully, as I said before, of the King of Bonea's Guard of Dogs,
so all those forementioned Worthies, have been, and are a diligent, watchful,
and strong guard, for the defense and support of all that we have attempted or
accomplished against the King, the Queen, the Nobility, Gentry, Commons, and
all that do either adhere, affect, aid, assist, serve, honor or obey, any of
the Malignants cause, Person or Party, amongst which Mercurius Britanicus has
been the most unmatchable, bold, brave, barking, brauling, biting Bandogge, and
deserves to be held as Captain of all our Guards of Writers, Speakers,
Preachers, either for Palpit, Pen, Press, Print, or, (as a man may say) and so
forth.

I will not derogate from the Learned, or detract, diminish, or extenuate, the
worths of other famous men in this kind, especially Mr Henry Burton, and Mr
William Prinne, they have acted their parts Tragicomically, and have (for the
propogation of our matchless and unexemplified Herculean Labors) most
Lawfully and Worthily, ascended to fames Pillor, I, but though these grave
Solons, and Reverend Renowned Annaxagor-Asses, have unanimously, jointly, and
severally done us services, beyond all Guerdon, yet for as much as they are in
a disconcordance, a disunion betwixt themselves, a disparitie of opinions, or
(to avoid tediousness) a kind of a contention.

For the much more then nine times most Reverend Mr Burton, he is elevated into
the Heroic Humor, and inspired with the all commanding spirit of Pompeius
Magnus, who would have no Equal; and Mr Prinne, is of the milder Majestic
opinion of Caesar, to allow equals, but no superiors. The one will be Dominus
Fac-totum, a Nowne Substantive, or a Substantial Independent, to command, and
not to be countermanded; The other is possessed, that the Parochial Presbytery
is more justly equal, and may better spinne out these our gainful
distractions, and weave out the War many a fair year (that we be not forced
to a Peace against our wills.) Thus these two, or this Brace of our Maine
Pillars, can neither agree, nor fall together by the Ears.

To Return from whence I have digres'd (Mercurius Britanicus) whose merits I
have partly showed, how he was vilified in this Honorable Assembly, I need not
to repeat, for his services I think him worthy of 2000 l per annum out of the
Public Faith's next Edition, or else (your grave wisdom's, may take into your
considerations, that he is an able Gentleman, and as capable to be made Lord
keeper of our new Great Seal as my self, or else he can perform and execute
the office of the Master of the Rolls, as sufficiently as Mr Speaker (without
disparagement) and so I leave him and his deserts to your wisdoms Honorable
disposal, and I also leave Sir Benjamin Ruddyard (who so bodily affronted and
calumniated Mercurius Britanicus) to your just and unerring censures.

At the end, conclusion, or Catastrophe of this speech, the whole house was in
a general pawse or silence, each of them Raped, or (as it were transported
with an ecstasy) struck with a sudden Admiration, at the composure, delivery,
accant, cadence, emphasis, utterance, volubility, eloquence, elocution, and
ornated phrase or style, of the Learned Sergeant, that at last, they all were
pleased (after some particular favorable coughs and hums) to applaud him with
a respective venerable general Hum, (in token of Approbation) and withal
clapping their hands (with an unanimous acclamation) they gave such a shout
that the noise was heard, from Westminster to Wapping, and Saint Thomas a
waterings, and when all was ended, the old Knight (Sir Ben. Rud.) was confined
to his Chamber, and Mercurius Britanicus his cause, was referred to an
afternoon-Committee.

FINIS.
