Wife of JOHN HVLL Esquire deceased.
A Diligent, Constant, Fruitful Reader and Hearer of the Word of GOD, Rested
from her Labors, June, 22. 1695. being the seventh day of the Week, a little
before Sunset; just about the time She used to begin the Sabbath.

Anno Aetatis suae 69.

Epitaph
GReat Sarah's Faith; joind with Good Hannah's Prayer;
For Hearing of the Word, glad Marles Care;
Aged Elizabeth's Just Walk; To dwell
Nigh Prophets, a true Shunamitish Zeal;
An Humble Soul, Trimmed with an High Neglect
Of Gay Things, but with Ancient Glories decked;
All these Expired at once! Arrayed with Them,
Our HULDAH's gone to Gods Jerusalem,
Without a Figure so, with her Last Breath
She Triumphed over that Holophernes, DEATH.
