Justitiarius justificatus. The Justice justified.
Being, an Apologeticall Remonstrance, delivered to the Honorable
Commissioners, of the Great Seal, by George Wither Esquire; and occasioned by
Sir Richard Onslow Knight, with some others, who moved to have him put out of
the Commission of the Peace, in Surrey: In which private-Defence, many things
are expressed, very pertinent to publike-consideration; and, to the
vindication of the Liberties of the Subject, in general, and of Magistrates,
in particular.
Honorable Lords, and Gentlemen, to whose custody and dispensation, the great
Seal and Conscience of this Kingdom is committed; suffer, I beseech you, with
patience, that, an humble Servant to the Muses, may, for a few minutes, make
his defense before you, against those who have lately abused both Him, and You,
by an impertinent Information. In the noblest Ages, and most glorious
Commonwealths, they, who were reputed Retainers to Apollo, were ever heard (in
making their defenses) with good respect; yea, even in those times and places,
wherein generositie, and civilitie, were least regarded, men had so much wit,
that though they secretly hated them, yet, for their own honor, they usually
kept fair quarter, with that Generation: and, it is a symptom of much
sottishness, when men do needlessely engage themselves by provoking others to
the hazzarding of their credit, and quiet. Mistake me not, I pray you, as if I
thus began, my Apology, to intimate some such imprudencie in you, my most
honorable Judges; for, I unfainedly profess, that, I neither have any
purpose, nor know any just cause, so to do: but, have made this preamble,
only, to hint unto those against whom I plead, what danger they might have
incurred, if I had been one of those Wits, whose Iambicks, can (...) make men
their own executioners; or, if I should have raged-out, an Invective, in
blustering Numbers, instead of this Apology, which I now, calmely, deliver in
Prose. But, to the matter.

It was my ill fortune (without my own seeking, desire, or foreknowledge
thereof, until it was done) to be made a Commissioner for the Peace and
Goale-Delivery in Surrey, since the beginning of this war; and, I foreseeing
the troubles which I might thereby bring upon my self, by reason of the
factiousnesse and malignancie of these times (and the small estate, which the
fury of the Common-enemy had left me) thought it good discretion not to accept
thereof; and was so resolved, until that resolution was unhappily changed by
the persuasion of Friends, who made me believe, that God, by my unsought-for
admittance, evidenced his calling of me, to serve him and my Country, in her
great necessities; and that, honesty and good affections joined with an
ordinary understanding, might make me as servicecable, as some other, who had
abler Faculties, and larger Estates. Thereupon, I accepted thereof, because my
education in the University and Innes of Court, made me, as I thought, no less
capable of that Office then some other of my Fellow-Commissioners; and,
because, also, my known conversation, my fashion of living, and my being ever
since my youth, an acceptable companion to many noble and honorable persons,
would render me (as I conceived) a Commissioner without contempt; though most
part of my estate was taken away: which, I thank God, I have hitherto been,
except among some of those, creatures without understanding, who usually value
themselves, and others, according to their Trappings: But, I chiefly accepted
thereof, because I saw many poor souls grievously oppressed by their
tyrannous neighbors, and hoped, God would by that Authority, enable me to
relieve some of them.

But, instead of what I then hoped, that, which I feared not, came to pass:
For, Sir Richard Onslow, and some other of his Friends in the County of
Surrey, have as it seems found it pertinent to the establing of their Designs
or Government there, that I should be thrust out of the Commission of the
Peace, as I have been, out of some Committees, and out of my habitation, for no
other causes, but such as are concealed in the breast of the said Sir Richard;
who, having got (as it were) the Supremacy over all Causes, and all Persons
Ecclesiastical and Civil, within his Dominions, disposes of Elections,
prefers Deputie-Lievtenants, makes and unmaketh Justices of the Peace,
Committee Men, Colonells, and all other inferior Military Officers,
Marshalls, Treasurers, and Collectors, as he pleases; yea, favors and
dis-favours, imposes and takes off, imprisons and sets at liberty, builds up
and pulls down, armeth and dis-armeth, ordreth and dis-ordreth, according to
his discretion, with little or no contradiction. And that his pleasure may be
fulfilled in all things, your Honors (as I am informed) have been lately
solicited, by him, to cashiere me from the Bench.

At first hearing thereof, I slighted it as a thing not worthy my regard; and
within my self, laughed to scorn the poor vanity of mine Adversary, who
thinks all my honor lies, as his does, about Guildford, and the West-Division
of Surrey; or, that, my contentment consists in having authority and power
over others, upon such terms, and to such frivolous ends, as most men desire,
and assume it for: and, thereupon, I thought to pass it over with perpetual
neglect. But, having better considered thereof, and what encouragement it might
give mine enemies, to improve their malice, in matters of more concernment, to
my self, and perhaps, to the disheartening, and enslaving of others, by his
prevailing against me; I saw it very necessary, to take speedy notice of the
wrong done: not only, lest my Oppressors should be encouraged to oppress me
the more; but, lest they might, also, foolishly conceive, that because I do
not, therefore I could not vindicate my self.

Upon this consideration, I have humbly presumed to make an Apologeticall
Remonstrance against them and their proceedings, who have appeared before you,
to do me such an affront, as had been too much, when Tyranny reigned; and is
therefore, much less to be endured now the Sword is drawn for the Rights, and
Liberties, of a Free People. And, though the honor which I care for, and
chiefly aim at, is not such as may be added, unto me, or taken from me, at
other men's discretions; yet (I being a little sensible of that Disgrace and
Reputation, which men of my constitution and frailty are usually affected
withal) have a mind to prevent the scorn of Fools, if I may, by preserving
my credit (through your favor and justice) in keeping that authority, which
my Adversaries endeavor to take from me; or, else, by making them and their
Favorers to see, that, I know how to honor my self, twice as much, another
way; and, how to hew Stairs, out of their Affronts, whereby I may ascend
highest, when they think they have brought me to the lowest condition.

I need not tell your Honors, how great a disgrace it is thought, to be put
out of that Commission: For, you very well know, it is not usually permitted,
save for very gross and apparent misdemeanors; and never upon any
clandestine, or slight informations; except, Will stood for Law, and when they
kept the Seal, who did arbitrarily put men in, and out, according as they were
swayed by their own, or by other men's corruptions: of which, I am not jealous
at this time; because, I have good hopes of your Equity, many evidences of
mine own Integrity, and, no fear of my greatest Enemies; except it be, that,
they will not desist from causelessly, and foolishly troubling and provoking me,
till they compel me to make all the Kingdom know them by name, and
understand their purposes, and condition, as well as I do. I cannot, therefore,
believe that persons so honorable, and so wise as your Lordships, will permit
me to be (as if were) kicked off like a football without hearing; I, having
been once reputed worthy to supply the room of a Judge upon Record; seeing, if
such an indignity should be offered, no man of merit, or of a right
understanding, would adventure himself upon such a tottering seat as the
Sessions-Bench; or, be much encouraged to relieve, and deliver the oppressed,
from their injurious and tyrannous neighbors; lest, when he was doing his
duty, and thought himself sufficiently authorized to be a comfort to others,
he might be secretly disabled, from securing his own person, from disgrace and
ruin.

Nay, my Lords, it honest men shall be (as it were) purposely set up, to be
pulled suddenly down again, to their disparagement, without hearing; upon the
motion of an Adversary; yea, and when their conversations and deportments (who
are traduced, or solicited against) have been such, that they dare ab^^e and
challenge trial, as I do: Or, if the Office of a Justice of Peace be but a
complement of respect, which you, of higher place, shall think fit to show us;
a thing to be played withal; or, an Ornament to be put upon us, and torn from
us again, at pleasure, according to the humors, and changeable inclinations
of others; let them take it, who are pleased with such toies; yea, let the
greatest fools of the Kingdom monopolize it to themselves: for, I shall be so
far from desiring to be continued in it, on those terms, that, I shall scorn
it, as fitting for none, but sneaking, baffel'd, and poore-spirited Fellows.

But, the Dignity of that Trust and employment, is indeed so honorable, and
the due execution thereof is of so much consequence, that it ought to be
preserved from contempt, by being conferred on persons deliberately chosen, and
eminent where they live, for their understanding and uprightness, having,
also, estates competently sufficient, to bear the charge of their Magistracy,
and to be answerable for their over-sights: And, when such are once authorized,
it is fitting that their reputation should be preserved, so long as they
continue in their integrity, and that they stand not in hazard of a
disgraceful removal, by the dis-favour, or secret supplantings of other men, so
long as they are able and willing to serve their Country. For to confer that,
or any other Office of Judicature (for an uncertain term) Duranti been
placito, expressively or implicitly intended, rather than with this clause,
Quam diu se been gesserit, was the practice of Tyrants, who intended, thereby,
to make their Officers the more serviceable to their Arbitrarie Designs; and,
therefore, it ought not to be endured in a free and well-governed Commonwealth:
especially, in a time when Reformation is intended, and by us, who have had
experience often, and lately, to our cost and smart, that, when men were
conscionable of their duties, and active in the execution of Justice, according
to the letter and equity of the Laws, (without fear or respect of persons) it
was usual to remove them with disgrace; and to supply their places, with such
as would be conformable to the corrupt will and pleasure of tyrannous Princes,
and their Parasiticall Favorites and Counselors, to the public detriment,
and dishonor. And, doubtless, when a man (which is my case) who never sought
for it, or desired it, shall be called to an Office of trust, and made to pay
great fees for being admitted, and for accepting to do the public service, to
his own trouble, and further cost, without profit; if then, and, even, after he
has faithfully executed the same (to the accumulating of hatred to himself,
for doing justice) he shall be disgracefully cast out, before hearing, or any
Cause shown, be left a cashiered Officer upon record; it is an injury justly
to be complained of, and fit to be remedied, and provided against.

I cannot imagine, that, the Gentlemen who took pains to appear, and solicit
your Honors against me, brought any considerable argument to prove reasonable
that which they desired; or, that the displacing of me, was any thing pertinent
to the well-governing of Surrey; nor have I yet any certainty of what they
alleged, because nothing is upon record. But, what moved some of them against
me, I do very well know; yea, and why they are so desirous to be rid of my
fellowship, and neighborhood in Surrey: which, I will forbear now to mention;
and, that I may be the more sure to take off all those just exceptions, which,
in my understanding, may seem helpful to accomplish their purpose, I will
suppose objections, and make distinct answers unto them, for my vindication.

All Objections, which I think can justly be made against thee, or any other,
to render him incapable or unworthy to be continued a Commissioner of Peace,
must either concern his manners, his Religion, his knowledge or judgment, his
faithfulness to Supreme Authority, his uprightness in the execution of his
Office, or the Competencie of his estate; and I will make it apparent, that in
all these respects, I am as little to be excepted against, as some of those,
who are, yet, to be continued in Commission, with their good liking, who have
excepted against me: yea, I presume I shall approve my self free from any just
exception, (notwithstanding the Statute) the times, and the present condition
of this Realm, being rightly considered.

As touching my manners, my life, and conversation, (though I am a great sinner
to God) I think no man has impudence enough to lay any thing to my charge;
no, not Sir Richard Onslow, who I am confident would not spare to discover any
thing, whereby he might safely, and justly, disparage and undo me; and,
therefore, I will apologize for my self no further in that respect, until he,
or some other, shall accuse me. My Religion teaches me to renounce the Popes
Supremacy, and, that is Religion enough, to keep me still in the Commission
of the Peace, though I professed no more; therefore, I shall not need to
catechize my self, or to make a larger Confession of my faith, upon this
Occasion. My knowledge and judgment, has, hitherto, been as seldom, and as
little questioned as any of my neighbors: and, if it be but sufficient (as I
hope it is) to enable me to speak, and discharge my duty, without the
control or advice of my Clerk, I am persuaded, it is more sufficiency, then
all my Fellow-Justices, throughout this Kingdom, may truly boast of. My
faithfulness to the State, is so overmuch evidenced to my damage at this
present, and so generally known, by my expressions and sufferings, heretofore,
as well as by my great losses, disbursements, endeavors, and the hazarding of
my life, in this War, that, most men of quality in these parts, do repute me
a man, to be unquestionably confided in, by the State; and in my conscience, if
it had been otherwise, some who are now mine Eenemies, would have been my very
good Friends.

In the execution of my Office, I have neither denied, delayed, or perverted
Justice, since my admission thereunto; nor put any man to so much cost for it,
as the expense of one Clerks-Fee; because, I have hitherto dispatched all
businesses with my one hand, and am loath to put any man to more charge then
need requires. I confess, I have not acted so much in the duties of that
place, as the many disorders, and the profaneness of many among us requires;
by reason, that, some of those, who now labor to put me out of the Commission,
have done what in them lies to drive me out of the County also, and have made
my residence, there, to be of late very seldom and uncertain: yea, and as far
as they dared, they have done me disrespects, and discourtesies (if I may term
them no worse) in the execution of all my Warrants, which have come to their
knowledge; and labored to make me vile, and contemptible, among my neighbors,
without cause.

For, when I had sent my Warrant for a dangerous Knave and a Whore, who had
traveled together out of Surrey, into the Kings Quarters (perhaps, employed to
conveigh intelligence) and, who lived in manifest uncleanness, at their
return; these (refusing contemptuously to be obedient to my Authority) were
countenanced therein, to my disgrace; and to the encouragement of such varlets,
and base people, in their contempts, and filthiness. And, whereas I had lately
committed two suspicious fellows, upon very strong probabilities of
horse-stealing, and had signified what evidence I had of their being dangerous
persons, and not fit to be bailed, but by very good sureties; some of these
Gentlemen, having the Prisoners carried afterward before them, by the
Constable, (who was to have conveyed them immediately to the Goal, according
to his duty, and my Warrant) the matter was (as it seems) so slighted, that
the said Constable suffered one of them, negligently, or wilfully, to escape
that night: and, for the other, a few weeks after, mean Bail was taken, by
one, or more of the said Gentlemen; not without scandalous intimations (as I
have heard) that the poor fellow was not, by me, proceeded against, so much
for being a suspicious person, as for that I thought thereby to get his horse;
he being apprehended, in a Manor where the Felons goods belong unto me: of
which intimation, if any of them were guilty, it implies an inveterate malice,
much to be taken heed of: and if my reputation stood in need to be cleared from
such a base aspersion, it will be vindicated at the next Goale-deliverie in
Surrey: For, the same party whom they so bailed, as a man whom I suspected,
not without evident cause, has (since he was let forth upon Bail) committed
diverse other Felonies; and, is now, reapprehended, and, a prisoner again, by
my diligence.

Now, if the exception made against me, be grounded upon that obsolete Statute
which requires every Justice of Peace to have Land of inheritance, of such, or
such an yearly value, in the County (which, I am certain is all that can be
reasonably objected to have me put out of Commission) then, there is a
coulerable exception against me: For, indeed, I have no inheritance there, but
only a hundred pounds per annum for a term to come, and some possibilities of
more hereafter. And, if I shall be removed for that only; then, my removal is
without any fault of mine: For, it is not merely my fault, (and I think your
Honors will believe it) that I have not land enough to be a Justice of Peace,
in every County of the Kingdom: nor does, indeed, either the practice, or
constitution of the times require the strict observance of that Statue, but
permits, and necessitates a dispensation thereof: And, some, even in that
County, who have not estates there answerable to the Letter of the Law, are,
nevertheless, kept still in Commission; and were first admitted (as I am
informed) by means of some, or one of those, who seek to have me cast out, for
the same inconsiderable defect. Amongst which persons, there are two very
observeable; one of them (who has but a little plot of Osiers in that County)
is so well befriended at Oxford, that (as I am credibly informed) he had lately
a Warrant for Venisen out the walled park near Kingston, under the Kings own
hand: the other, who, seems to be either Advocate or Solicitor General for
Delinquents, at Kingston-Committee, has no more but a poor Potters cottage
near Chertsey in that County, of about eight pounds per annum. There, is
otherwhile, as much need of wit and honesty, in the execution of that Office,
as of a Landed-man. Men of large fortunes, and little conscience, have so long
engrossed places of Power, and Trust, and made such use of Magistracy, for
private and sinister ends, that, they have destroyed our Peace, and endangered
all our Freedoms: and, therefore, it is now requisite (and, God, in justice,
will so have it) that, the stout, faithful, and prudent Citizens, and the men
of midling-Fortunes, who were heretofore scorned and oppressed, should be
called into Office and employment, that (if it be possible) their courage,
wisdom, piety, and integrity, might help our honorable Senators, to redeem
us from those miseries, and slaveries, into which the Canibals of the Court,
and the Sagamores of the Country* have by their pride, and perfidiousnesse,
lately brought us. And, doubtless, though this temporary cause of dispensing
with the Statute were removed, it were no intrenchment upon the true intent and
equity of the Law (according to which your Court ought to judge) if a Justice
of Peace be continued, who has a personal estate, sufficient to keep his
Authority from contempt; and, to enable the discharge of his duty: especially,
if the Kingdom be so much indebted unto him (as it is now to me, even in the
same County where I am a Commissioner) that, it may suffice to repair, all
public, and private damages also, which may be sustained by the Justices
Imprudence, neglect, or corruption. Sure I am, if none should be Commissioners
of the Peace, in some Counties, as our affairs now stand, but great Landlords;
there would be little hope of equity, in many places.

Having thus pleaded to every exception, which may be colourably made against
me; I could say somewhat else, lying now at my torgues end, which if it were
plainly expressed, and could be as well proved to others, as it is manifest to
my self, would, perhaps, both continue me in the Commission of the Peace, and
make me of the Quorum also, if it were uttered in a good hour: But, because
good days, and hours, are very rare and uncertain with me; and, lest a
worse thing may befall me, than putting out of Commission (if it be ill timed)
I will silence my present thoughts, for ever; or until I see such a day, as
may give them a happy birth, without hazard: and, I will now express
somewhat, to take away that rigid opinion of me, which may, perhaps, be
entertained, by reason, so many Gentlemen of Surrey have appeared with Sir
Richard Onslow, to solicit your Honors to put me out of Commission. For,
doubtless, it could not but make the whole Court, and all there present, who
knew me not, to conceive unworthily of me; and therefore, though not for mine
own sake, yet for the sake of that which God has heretofore enabled me to
express, concerning this Nation, and the judgments now upon us (which may,
else, be made the less regarded, and the less effectual to those who read
me) it seems necessary, that I should apologize, a little, to that purpose.

If I did not know, that to be an honest man, and a professed enemy to corruption
and oppressions, were enough to make me hated and persecuted of some men; or,
if experience had not acquainted me, how cunningly some can draw in others, to
make their presence a countenance to their designs, who know not why they are
called (as, by their own confession to me, it fared with some who accompanied
Sir Richard Onslow to your Honors) I should have much wondered, that, so many
Gentlemen should have concurred in so discourteous an office, considering, most
of them have seemed to respect me, and are men whom I love and honor; and,
considering also, how civilly I have ever behaved my self toward them, and all
other of that County, not withstanding many provocations to the contrary.

For, I solemnly protest before God, that, to my remembrance, I do not know any
person in Surrey, with whom I had any quarrel, or unkind contestation, before
this War, or since it began, but, with respects, merely to the Public Cause;
neither any one, whom I have, wittingly, wronged so much, in deed or word, but,
that, one penny will make satisfaction, for the whole injury, sevenfold. Nay,
I have not done to any one of those Gentlemen so much as a seeming injury, or
dis-respect, except, it seems a disrespect, to have refused to join with
some of them in the erecting of Alc-houses, or in such like concurrences, which
I thought unfitting to be assented unto: Or, except it may seem a dis-respect
to Sir Richard Onslow, that I lately set at liberty a poor man, whom (as I
conceive) he had arbitrarily, and wrongfully committed, without cause shown,
to the infringement of the just Freedoms of the people, and the Laws of the
Land: Or, except he thinks it a dis-respect unto him (as I have heard he takes
it to be, with an imputation of ingratitude unto me) that, I will not
acknowledge my self to have been made Captain of the Horse first raised in
Surrey, for the Parliament, merely, by his friendship; whereas, he, and the
County knows, I was made choice of, by the Well-affected, before he had any
thought of me to that purpose; yea, and in opposition to his election: For
(till he saw it would be in vain) he labored to bring in the son in Law of
Mr. Muschamp, then, reputed a violent Malignant; and the Gentleman whom he
would have made Captain, was not, at that time, barely suspected, but so
really a Malignant, that he became, soon after, a Commander for the King;
where (I verily believe) he did him worse service, than he might have done,
had he commanded those Horse in Surrey. Or, except it seems a dis-respect to
Sir Richard, that I would not re-admit upon his Letter, (and upon his
engagement unto me for him) the natural son of the said Mr. Muscamp, to be
Cornet of my Troop; out of which place (the said Sir Richard having preferred
him thereto) I cashiered him, because he behaved himself mutinously, and
sought to allure away my Troopers, and my Lieutenant to serve the King; unto
whom the said Cornet went, shortly after, and was made a Captain also. My
Lieutenant, being likewise of Sir Richard Onslow's own choice, I was forced to
cashiere, as well because he leaned the same way, as for other misdemeanors.
Or, except it seems a dis-respect, to Sir Richard, that, before his consent
thereunto, I was (without my seeking or knowledge thereof, until it was
determined) freely, and unanimously nominated for Colonel, by the Committee of
the Militia for Surrey, (being a very full Committee sitting at Kingston) and
was (by the same Committee) August 7. 1644. ordered to take charge of all
Forces, then raised, and to be raised, in the East, and middle Divisions of
Surrey; and, that, I presumed to accept thereof, without Sir Richard Onslowes
consent; who, indeed, was much out of patitience there with, and could never
after be at quiet, until he had contrived the new modelling of the Militia,
there, according to his own fancy; For, thereupon he procured the reducement
thereof under the Lievtenancie again, by which etc. Or, except it seem a
dis-respect, unto the said Sir Richard, that when he offered to be Commander in
chief, over the whole Militia in Surrey, and to make me his
Lievtenant-Colonell, I refused the same, thinking it no discretion to quit a
superior, for an inferior Command; or, to hazard the being twice deceived, by
one man; or, to subject my self, to him, who (I thought) regarded neither my
profit, nor my credit, nor my life: and, I partly refused it, because I was
loath to be sharer with him in the honor gotten (if I may so call it) at the
siege of Basing; which was famous, at that time, through the whole Kingdom.

Or, except it seem a dis-respect unto him, that I seldom concurred with him,
in his designs; especially, in his opposition to the Association; in his
arming Malignants, and others promiscuously; and, in his putting the County
into those postures, and to those excessive-impertinent charges, and troubles,
which, in my judgment, were more likely (by weakening, and discontening the
people) to endanger, then to secure, those parts. Or, unless he conceive it a
dis-respect unto him, that, when in my Se-Defendendo, I publicly vindicated my
self, from being any way blameable, that, Farnham-Castle (whereof I had
command at the beginning of this war) was left imprudently (if not
treacherously) to the Enemy; and so cleared my self, that, I thereby gave
those who were unsatisfied, occasion to seek further, and lay the fault where
it was. Or, except it seem a dis-respect to Sir Richard Onslow, that I should
say, I thought, his procuring me to be put into the foresaid Castle, was not
for that end which he first pretended: For, when I consider the series, and
concatenation of his proceedings in Surrey, and his continuing-endeavours, from
time, to time, in prosecutions, with reference to that Castle, (with the
manifold charges, disturbances, and divisions, which have been occasioned, by
his restless seeking to accommplish some secret design of his own, which, I
conceive he has, or has had, upon that Place) I am still, so persuaded, my
thoughts have therein done him no wrong; that, I profess again, I do verily
believe, he has aimed at some establishment there, for his own advantage, ever
since the war began: and, that he has thereby occasioned most of the
miseries which have wasted Hampshire, and Surrey; and, because this belief
shall not appear to be without a Foundation, I will, out of a long chain of
reasons, linked into each other, present you with a few.

The reason why I do believe, that he, the said Sir Richard, occasioned much
of the spoil made in Hamp-shire and Surrey; is, for that, it seems unto me,
to be chiefly (if not altogether) his fault, that a strong Garrison was not
established at Farnham, when the command thereof was first given unto me: For,
had that Southern passage to London been strongly guarded, by well fortifying
of Farnham, for the present, and by removing the Garrison afterward to Basing
(according to my design then proposed) we should have so comforted, and
increased, the Well-affected; and so discouraged, and suppressed Malignants,
that, many of those occasions would have been prevented, which drew both
Parties, so often, that way, to the impoverishing, and discontenting of those
Counties; yea, and a little charge (in respect of what was afterward
necessitated) would, at first, have kept out the flood, which made the first
breach, and spoil; and which, being once made, could never since be stopped so
strongly up, but that every little Torrent broke in upon us; to the
increasing, or prolonging, of our afflictions.

The reasons, why I believe it his fault, that, for preventing these mischiefs,
a strong Garrison was not timely completed at Farnham, are these: Upon due
examination, of his beginning and his proceedings, I could perceive no
assurance, that he intended to fortify it; unles it might be for such ends as
he secretly purposed: For, the Commission, whereby I was made Governor (though
procured, by Sir Richard, in my Name, and delivered to me) was so drawn up,
that, what I seemed to be, I was not. He himself, and another, had a
superintendencie over me, and I was, from them, to expect Orders, Ammunition,
Provisions, Arms, and all the Forces, which I was likely to have; and, nothing
was left in my power, but the disciplining of my Horse, (of Foot, when I could
get them) and the guarding of undefensible, and bare walls, without works, or
so much as strong gates; which, to make the place more tenable, ought speedily
to have been looked unto, and provided for, in time; as might have been, and,
as the opinion, which I then had of Sir Richard Onflow made me hope it should
be. But, after many messages, visits, (and the keeping of Dawes, and Crows,
there, till I was ashamed of my command) Sir Richard himself came unto me,
and, in stead of what I expected, persuaded me to quit my Government of the
Castle, and to betake my self to my Troop only, as likely to be of longest
continuance: For, (said he) though I procured you this command, for the
present, and, to avovd surprisall by the Enemy; it is not purposed, it shall be
long held for a Garrison; and, that if it should be so continued, yet, I could
not then command both. Upon which overture, if (as perhaps was expected) I had
persuaded him, to assume the government upon himself, and, so complied with
him, that he might commendably have taken, thereby, occasion also, to have so
contrived it; I am persuaded, I had, then, answered his expectation: But, I
bluntly replied to this effect: That I knew the place of such concernment, as
would make it of ill consequence, if it were not speedily fortified, and
continued defensible; that, to have the keeping of an Inland-Garrison, without
Horse (an Enemy being in the field) was a kind of imprisonment; that, I,
having taken upon me the trust, and profession of a Soldier, it would be
dishonorable to me, to give up the best part of my Command, to mine own
disadvantage, without any security, or benefit to the Public; and, that
therefore, I would not assent thereunuo, until I saw no remedy: which, gave
him so little contentment, that, with some faint promises of supply, he
departed; and, never sent me any thing afterward, but words, and
discouragements; until I, and my Troop, were called thence, to the undoing of
the County, and to the plundring of my estate, by leaving the Castle to the
possession of the Enemy: And, from that time till this, he has never been my
friend, but sometimes from the teeth outward; and apparently injurious to me,
oftentimes. Other reasons I have, moving me to believe what is before said,
which I will omit till further occasion.

If the said Sir Richard conceive, that such thoughts, and such a belief of
him, as is before expressed, are a wrong unto him; or, if it be injurious unto
him, for me to think (as, I confess, I do, upon vetie good grounds, in my
opinion) that he is the greatest Favourer of Delinquents, and the most bitter,
and implacable Enemy to them, who are eminently Well-affected to the
Parliament, of any man in Surrey, so much pretending the contrary, as he has
done; Verily, he himself, and not I, is cause of the injury (if any be) by
giving many occasions of such thoughts, and belief of him, as make it
impossible for me, yea, and (as I hear) for many hundreds, to believe
otherwise. It had been possible for me, to have concealed this belief, if his
provocations, and the perpetuity of his malice, had not necessitated an
expression thereof; as well, heretofore, for the Public Security; as now, for
my private vindication; and he had sooner heard of it, but that we knew not
how to make approaches, for defense of the safety, and privileges belonging
to the Whole Body of the Commonaltie, without endangering our ruin, by seeming
to violate the Sanctuary of personal privileges, though we did but break
through their encroachments, to do our duties.

These particulars considered, Sir Richard Onslow might have manifested more
prudence, by forbearing, to provoke me beyond all moderation; for, the patient
creature, who can pass by scorns, and injuries, or let a Fool ride him,
three or four years together, without kicking, or hurling his Rider into
dirt, may be pinched in such a place, or Wither-gall'd in such a hot season,
that his wronged patience may, perchance, turn into madness, and so, both the
Fool, and the Ass, mischief each other. The heaving of me from the Seat of
Magistracy, is not that which now moves me to make this Vindication, though
it occasions it; but, the consequences, which are expected, should follow: For,
I was once before put into authority, and out again, ere I knew either the
one, or the other; or, without so much as asking, or caring, who did it, or why
it was done: For, I can be as merry, and as wise, when I am out of authority,
as when I am a Justice of the Peace; my Friends love me as well, my Companions
think I am as good company, and (if I have not too high an opinion of mine own
good dispossition) the Gentlemen, who have taken so much pains, to put me out
of their Fellowship, may have a worse Companion, than I have hitherto been.

For, I am not such a Cynick, as many, who know me not, have supposed me to
be; but, can sit at a Sessions, or Weekly-meeting, and hear some of my
worshipful Associates, make long speeches, to the Countrey-people, without
envying the wisdom, which is attributed unto them, for it: and, whether they
speak sense, or, nonsense; impertinencies, or, to the purpose, it never much
troubles me, so businesses be timely dispatched, and, our duties honestly
performed, at the last. I could, also, very contentedly, continue silent by
them, upon the Bench, and permit them to have all the talk, and the mannaging
of every business, without interruption; yea, and suffer them to reprove, or
encourage, as there was cause; or, to the advancement of their own repute,
without striving to put in my word, or my opinion, when it seemed needless;
except it were, that, the people might take notice of me, and know me to be
a man in authority, as well as they: And when the merit of the Cause, the
furtherance of Justice, or the prevention of an injury, likely to befall any
man, shall move me to speak, I love to do it, in as few words, as I can; that,
they whose custom it is, may have time to hear themselves speak, if any such
be present. I hope (though I have heard so) there is no man among them so
foolish, as to think me a disparagement to the Commission, because I have the
title of a Poet; for, King James was so ambitious to be so called, that he
preferred a Wreath of Laurel (the Poets Crown) before his Golden Diadem, as
appears by some of his coins, and medalls: yea, that title, has been, by the
learned, reputed an honor, even to Solomon, and David; the translation of
whose holy Songs, and Psalms, by me, into Lyrick numbers, has been a means,
so to sanctify my Poesy, for divine uses; that, this Faculty will not now
render me despicable, but among Barbarians; and, how they esteem of me, I care
not.

My Lords, I perceive, this pursuit of my slipperie Iustice-ship, has made my
pen outrun the Constable, before I am aware: I will therefore, add a concluding
dash or two, and make an end. I dote not so upon sitting upon the Bench, with
Sir Richard Onslow, as to be sollicitous, for mine own sake, whether I am in,
or out of the Commission, for ever: But, for my Countrey-sake, and for the
preservation of the Privileges, due to a Free-Subject, I could not permit your
candor, and credulity, to be abused, by remaining misinformed; nor will my
pen to be at rest, until I shall be fairly heard, to the repair of my credit,
(if any be lost) and, to the repossessing of that respect which is due to a
faithful Officer: Nor will I be silent (if a patch of Freehold be so
considerable, that no worth or desert is to be regarded without it) till I
have, at least, such a proportion of my Losses, Disbursements, and Arreares,
paid unto me, as will buy me so much land of inheritance, as may make me a more
considerable man in that County, where they have sought to disgrace me. No,
nor will I then be silent, until I see the Law, by which my Justice-ship is
questioned, to be executed, or dispensed, equally, to all men, without
partiality; and, until the election, and continuance, of all such Officers,
as are, or were, ordained for preservation of Peace, the distribution, or
execution of Justice, and the safety of the Peoples lives, and Liberties,
reduced to what (by Law, or equity) they ought to be.

My hope, to see that effected, makes me endure, the more patiently, the scorn
now cast upon me, in requital of all my losses, sufferings, hazzards, and the
forbearance of my Arrears. And, I doubt not but there will come a day, in which
I shall not be thought so impertinent, as some of my neighbors, in Surrey, now
think me to be: but, may perhaps (without fawning, or bribing for it) be
thought as fit to serve in my own Country, in some place of profit, and
credit, as to govern in the Summer-Islands, whither I should have been sent,
last year, (and whither I would willingly have gone, if my losses, and
arrears, might have been first obtained, to fit me for the voyage) upon hope
whereof, though that which is due to me for my Service, and by the Public
Faith, is enough (beside my long forbearance thereof) to purchase more then ten
times so much land in any County of this Kingdom, at this day, as a Justice
of Peace is required to have; And, though I cannot yet be dispensed withal, as
well as my neighbors, I will, nevertheless, attend patiently, till that day of
favor comes; and until the Stars, both of the greater, and lesser
magnitudes, in our English Firmament, shall meet in a Constellation, which will
be more favorable to me; and, make my inconsiderable defects, as little liable
to exceptions, as other men's.

I perceive, many other, as well as my self, exposed to such usages, who are
weary of complaining; or, who dare not complain, least they may be used
worse, by those, who have the advantages of Time, and Place, openly, to
illustrate their own praise, and, secretly, to disparage other men. I see,
daily, that they, who were generally reputed the most dangerous Malignants,
and, who never showed themselves for the Parliament, but by compulsion, (or,
until it began, evidently, to prevail) are, now, become powerful among us:
yea, they are politikely ingratiated, indeered, and brought insensibly in, to
strengthen a Party against those, who (from the beginning) have acted
faithfully, and freely, for the public; and, for the discovery of their
neutralitie, and dis-affection, who, by now seeming to be with us, will more
undo us, and more dis-advantage the Common-safety, then all our open-Enemies;
yea, and make our habitations unsecure, and our lives, for ever, miserable unto
us, if their combinations, and purposes, be not timely prevented, by some
Ordinance, forbidding the admission of any such to be in Authority. For, some
of them are already in Surrey (as I hear) and elsewhere, in spite of the
well-affected, made Committee Men, Commissioners of the Peace,
Deputy-Lievtenants, Colonells, Captains, and other Military Officers, (I will
not, yet, say Parliament Men, though I think I might) to the grievance, and
oppression of many, who dare not seek Remedy lest it prove worse to them then
the Disease. Insomuch, that it is evident to me (and, as I believe, plain to
many thousands) that, some have an intention, to discountenance, and disgrace,
by degrees, those who have been eminently zealous, and freely bountiful of
their blood, and estates, for the Common-liberty, and safety; and, are putting
themselves and their Confederates, into such a posture, as may probably, enable
them, to continue the people in slaverie to their pride, and arbitrarie
pleasure, when advantages may be securely taken: which advantages, may, no way,
be more safely gained, then by putting those out of Authority, who have been a
comfort to the well-affected from the beginning; and, placing in their stead,
those, who may discountenance them, and encourage their malignant neighbors,
as they do in Surrey, and elsewhere, also, as I am informed.

Your Lordships will, perhaps, think me tedious, over-bold, and somewhat
impertinent, in this Apology, and Remonstrance; but, you would excuse my
tediousness, if you knew experimentally, how hard it is for a man to be
silent, when he has once gotten an opportunity to speak (of those things
which are grievous unto him) before Persons, whom he thinks able to give him
some ease; and, you will, I hope, pardon also, my bluntness, and digressions,
when you see (as in my Cause) what near relations the publike-grievances, and
the private-sufferings of honest men, have one to another, justly occasioning
some transitions from private, to public, and from public, to private
considerations, to the lengthening of discourses, beyond our intentions.

It may be thought, likewise, at first apprehension (and to my disavantage, if
it be so taken) that, I have scandalized a Member of the Honorable House of
Commons, by nominating Sir R. Onslow, in this Apology; but, I desire it may be
seriously considered, how essential it was unto my effectual justification,
that I should nominate him; and, in what manner, and, with what circumstances I
have done it; for, I think it will then appear, to the wisdom of the rest of
the Members, that I have done my self right, without wronging Them, or Him: If
it prove otherwise, I shall repent, and acknowledge my error, with much
contrition. For, I prefer the preservation of their just Privileges, and
Honor, so far before mine own reputation (though I prefer that before my
life) that, I would expose my self to any hazard, rather than to prosecute
mine own vindication, by wilful intrenching upon their
Essentiall-Priviledges. And, I am persuaded, I so well know, how to distinguish
between Scandalum datum, and Scandalum acceptum, that, I doubt not, but to make
it evident (if it be any way questionable) that, I have kept within the Sphere
of mine own Privileges; and, that it is possible, to pursue such an
Adversary, even to the Horns of the Altar, and, yet, not pollute the
Sanctuary.

The Commonwealth is more endangered by Mutes, then by Vowells; by Flatterers,
then Free-speakers; and more dishonored, by some of their own Members, who
are over-violently zealous for personal Privileges, then by any of those,
who, out of care, to preserve the whole Body, may wring a part of it, for a
while, by mistake, or misinformation. There was an Ananias among the
Disciples, without any disparagement to the rest; and as there have been
False-Brethren, among the Lords, and Commons, heretofore, so there may be, now,
and hereafter, notwithstanding any assurance we have to the contrary.
Therefore, to those who are upright in the Houses, and unto the whole
Commen-wealth, we do more wrong, in being afraid to speak freely, and plainly,
of those corruptions, and of those Persons, whom we think in our consciences,
may occasion public detriments and dangers, then we can do injury, by
disclosing of them, according to our Covenant, and duty; though it should be
done with some indiscretion, and circumstances, to the disparagement of a
particular Member; seeing, it were better that one should suffer, then, that,
all should be endangered, by our silence.

This, is my judgment; and, my practice has been accordingly, all my life;
yet, I have not, either directly, or personally, charged any one hitherto;
partly, because, I apparently know many things to be true, which I cannot
prove legally, to other men: but, principally, because, I love not to be an
Accuser of my brethren, or, a prosecutor of other men's infirmities, to their
open personal suffering, so long as I may have hope to do it secretly, for
their reformation, and without doing wrong, to the public. But, if I find not
the Insolences of some men to be speedily reformed; and the good Affections,
losses, and services, of those, who have borne, and forborne, for
publike-respects, to be better represented to the Parliament, (who, being
overburthened by the multiplicitie of emergent affairs, daily renewing, and
pressing upon them, cannot discover some things by sitting in the House, which
we see, too often, by walking abroad) I shall be more particular in my reproofs
hereafter, then I have been heretofore, whatever come on it: and, though I
cannot, perhaps, deliver my self, from disgrace, and that undoing, which my
Adversaries threaten; yet, I will perish to some purpose (if I must perish) by
sacrificing my endeavors (and life, if need be) for the relief of my
Fellow Sufferers, whose patience is almost quite lost by their practices, who,
by pretending to act with, and for the Parliament, do secretly, and cunningly,
what they can, to bring dis-honour, and contempt thereupon, by their
hypocrisy, and injustice, which, I pray God to prevent: and, to let me live no
longer, then I shall purpose, and endeavor (according to my understanding) to
preserve the power and reputation, of that Supreme Court, in whatsoever I
publish, or speak; though some Members thereof, do, now, and may hereafter,
forget their duties, as others have done heretofore; and, may thereby force me
to express somewhat, for the purging of a corrupt-part, that the health and
life, of the whole, may be preserved.

If, therefore, my Tongue, or my Pen, shall now, or, at any time, slip through
indiscretion, or frailty, let me be considered, according to the probability
of my good intention, and the sorrow which I shall express for my oversights:
For, I desire to preserve a good opinion with your Honors, and, with all men,
if it may be, in the performance of my duties; and, that those, whom I love and
honor, as I do your Lordships, and the two Houses, (whereof you are Members)
may not, at this time, be made Instruments of my disparagement, without cause:
Seeing, if my heart were as legible as my words, it would be no contentment
unto you, that I should be sentenced, before you had heard as well what might
be spoken for me, as against me; neither would you think it added any thing
to your honor, if when your short term of Authority is expired. I should be
left in worse repute, by your Act, then I was at the late renewing of your own
Commission. But. Fiat voluntas Dei, I have discharged my conscience, and, am
assured, that God, who has many times heretofore delivered me from powerful,
and malicious Enemies, to my reputation, and their shame, will be as merciful
unto me, now, and hereafter.

GEO. WITHER.
