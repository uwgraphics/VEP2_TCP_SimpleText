OVID'S INVECTIVE or CURSE AGAINST IBIS, Faithfully and familiarly Translated
into English Verse.

And the Histories therein contained, being in number two hundred and fifty (at
the least) briefly explained, one by one; With Natural, Moral, Poetical,
Political, Mathematical, and some few Theological Applications.

Whereunto is prefixed a double INDEX: One of the Proper Names herein
mentioned; Another of the Common Heads from thence deduced.

Both pleasant and profitable for each sort, Sex and Age, and very useful for
Grammar Schools.

By John Jones M. A. Teacher of a private School in the City of HEREFORD.

IBIS, peribis? nec Liber tuam potest
Redimere vitam? ut Clericus quamvis legas,
Latin, and Anglice; novo, and veteri stylo,
Suspender, eheu, Furcifer caput Tuum?
Potius premaris, opto: Cur jugum ferant
Hoc liberi Homines, jure quod Liber ferat?
At, Te cremari, non premi velim, Liber;
Modo, qui premuntur, liberi forent jugo:
IBIS, peribis, omine hoc, silentio.
To Captain Anonymus Anargyrus.
What Captain can a common Soldier press
For public service, lawfully, unless
Press-Money first he claps into his hand?
Man without Money will have poor command.
Such is my Book, no private promise may
Press it, nor Public Faith, but present Pay.

I knew a Cobbler once had skill in Awll,
Whom most of us did John Translator call,
So may thou me: my Cobling has no End,
Yet where I Cobble thou will not com-mend.

To all his worthy Friends in ENGLAND, J.J. Dedicates this his Translation of
IBIS.
PLease read Mercurius Poeticus
Of Naso Englished: Politicus,
Nor Aulicus, nor large Britannicus,
Nor any of that Gang, e're brought to us
Such general News from all parts; Africa,
And Europe, Asia, and America.
How Machiavell has plotted Treachery,
Under the reverend Mask of Piety:
How Kings are killed that do their subjects vex;
How Phaeton^ick spirits break their necks:
Such news are hither fled, though not so new,
Such Plots are practiced; Would it were not true.
Yet in this Book are more prodigious things
Sent over by Ovid upon Ibis wings:
Believed who will, I cannot; He Is a Poet:
Yet better trust him, then rake Hell to know it.
Heavens bless you English, that read Ibis Curse,
Grudge not that time; it is spent in News-books worse.
Deign Ibis roost, she has renewed her Age;
Vncleaner Birds, in Europe, have a Cage.
Her good old Master's dead, her new one's dying,
And she for shelter throughout England flying.
To all his worthy Friends in the Dominion of WALES, J. J. Dedicates this his
Translation of OVID'S Invective against IBIS.
ON Parnasse hill rose the Nectarian Font,
Where sisters nine, the Poets Mothers, wont
To fill themselves as public Cisterns, and
Derive by Conduits, throughout every land,
Their influence: Thus Art will quickly bring
Waters so high in ascent as they spring:
Thus the Inanimate Messenger will straight
Convey from hill to h^ll, of equal height,
Though far remote. When I in Wales do pass,
Methinks some hills show level to Parnasse,
The air no less acute: If any vein
Within my body does a drop contein
Of purer blood, that to the Welsh I ow,
Whence my fore fathers sprung; and who does know,
But my Poetic ve^ne, if such thing be,
From that instinct of Nature came to me?
Philosophers are made so, Poets are
So born; but Nature void of Art looks bare.
As grateful Rivers tribute do return
Unto the pregnant Springs where they were born:
So does my Muse these First Fruits offer you,
And when she is more able more will vow.
To the READER.
THis Youthful study, (thus some Novellists have childishly nicknamed Poetry)
for a man who have already lived more years then Ovid, who am almost worn out
in Body and Spirits, by that unexpressible labor of Teaching School, not much
less then forty years, might seem rather to condemn me of an affected Frenzy,
then commend me for any ingenious Fancy. But the indefatigable and real Love
which I have, do, and ever will bear to Scholars, past, present and future, as
well in others as my own Tuition, (backed with animation of many good friends)
has induced me to adventure on this elaborate, though little Poem: A work I
thought too hard for my greener, and find not easy for my riper age. A work so
difficult, that the pa^e of Oedipus, or a Sybill, might sweat in the unridling
of some pieces of it; so compendious and complete, that I may truly say, here
is not only Homer's Iliads in a Nut-shell, as it was once presented to the
greatest of Emperors; but a mere Epitome of the most and the best of the Works
of Homer, Virgil, and other Poets; of Plutarch, Diodorus, and other Historians;
yea of all the Works of Ovid himself. This Enchiridion will prove, I hope, not
a Pamphlet, but a Panoply, or Pandora's basket. Hence may Scholars, under the
Ferula, find help for composing of a Theme, both in Prose and Verse. Hence may
young Gentlemen find help for discourse in History and Poetry. Hence may the
Aged, if learned, recall to memory what they read in youth; if otherwise, they
are not so old but they may hence learn somewhat. In a word, out of this Curse
of Ovid, each sort, Sex and Age may pick a blessing, as Sampson did swe^t out
of the strong, honey out of the Lion. If any of my English verses seem rugged,
and to run like a bowl upon a rock, a civil and smooth censurer, without wrong
to his judgment, may lawfully excuse me, for these ensuing reasons.

First, In the whole Poem I was as much bound to conclude each sentence in the
narrow compass of one Distich, as each Distich is bound to the strict number of
so many and no moor Feet.

Secondly, I have endeavored, not Paraphrastically, as some have done in many
Authors, but punctually, (as near as sense and verse could bear it) to render
my Poet in English word for word.

Thirdly, and lastly, Most of the Distichs in this book do comprehend Histories
so narrowly couched, and chained together, that in the one Distich you will
find sometimes fewer, sometimes three, or two, at the least one. So that I may
boldly say, there are not so many histories of so few verses of any Poet now
extant whatsoever. All these histories I have one by one, briefly and fully
illustrated and explained, by collecting and comparing the several conjectures
of the choicest Authors that have walked in that path. The most that I have
stolen in composing this small piece of Illustration, was many hours snatched
from night, and my own repose: For the day was not mine, but dedicated to that
Sisyphon-toil of the Education of Youth. And to add, as it were a M^nd to the
Body, for the benefit of old and young, I have brought home each history to our
own selves by Application. First Physical; for under the shadowing names of
fictitious Heathen Deities is covered the Body and Substance of Natural
Philosophy; Poets under Allegories expressing the wonderful works of Nature.
Secondly, Ethicall; For the utmost scope the Poets aimed at, was not Fables,
but Morality. Here be Precepts that will inform the Understanding, reform the
Affection, and direct the Will: Here are noble examples, inflaming the mind
with candid emulation; leading, as it were by the hand, through the temple of
Virtue, to the temple of Honor. H^re be more perfect Rules then those of Men
or Fortune, in the exalting of Virtue and suppression of Vice; showing the
Beauty of the one and Deformity of the other. Thirdly, Theological: For let a
skilful hand modestly draw aside the curtain of Poetry, there will fairly
appear the sovereign face of the Queen of all Arts, Divinity. Tertullian is
plain and pithy; Many of the Poetical fictions, says the Father, had their
original from the Scriptures. And without all question, as before Letters the
Ancients expressed their conceptions in Hieroglyphics, so did the Poets their
Divinity under Fables and Parables. In Poetry you may discern an Unity and a
Trinity. One God under several attributes and effects; Three persons all
Brothers, Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto. Their Ensigns a three-forked Thunderbolt, a
threeforked Mace, a three-headed Dog. Three Graces, three Fates, three Furies.
In Poetry are described the Joys of Heaven charactred by the Elysian fields,
the Torments of Hell deciphred in the burning lake of Phlegeton, and the
Tortures of damned ^xion and the rest. In this little Manual of IBIS is enough
to furnish you with Political and Mathematical observations, as far as so small
a bulk can hold. My Illustration may afford you a Key and a Clew, to guide you
through every intricate room of this darksome labyrinth: But first and
principally please to take in your hand this grand Key of the Porch or Entry;
the Author and the Argument.

Publius Ovidius Naso, a Roman Knight, of an ancient Family, one of the
completest Gentlemen in Augustus Caesar's Court; a great admirer, and as much
admired of the excellent Poets in that learned Age: He had an ample Patrimony
at Sulmo, an house and Temple in the City, and another house near the Capital,
with pleasant Gardens and plentiful Orchards. But in this so happy condition,
in the one and fiftieth year of his age, he was banished, or rather confined to
Tomos, a City in Sarmatia, bordering upon the Euxin Sea, by Augustus Caesar.
The cause of this so cruel and deplored Exile is guest at more then known. Some
do conjecture that it was for his too much familiarity with Julia the Emperors
daughter; Others that he had unfortunately seen the incest of Caesar. But the
pretended occasion was, for the composing the Art of Love; and the Emperor to
salve his own and his daughters honor, would have it thought so among the
people. Having spent few years in this cold and comfortless Climate, he was
possessed (to add to his misery) with this unwelcome news, That one of Rome whom
Caelius Rhodiginus calls Corvinus, Suetonius calls Hyginus, but the most
Cornificus; (a fit name for a Horn-maker) had in his absence solicited his
wife, labored against the Repeal of his Banishment, and being a great
favorite of Augustus, endeavored to gain the whole estate of the Banished
Knight unto himself. Our smooth and gentle Poet, that never writ a virulent
verse before, being half horn-mad hereupon, in a jealous apprehension, lips his
Quill in bitterest Gall, and pens this last and least, but best of all his
Poems; Masking his Enemy (as the Greek Poet Callimachus did Apollonius that
stole his Verses, and published them for his own) under the ambiguous name of
IBIS; a name more ugly then that D^lphical SMECTYMNUUS. This IBIS was a
spurcitious unclean Bird of Egypt, hanting the River Nilus, feeding upon
nothing but stinking carcases, spued thence upon the land by Inundations: She
used to purge her gorged panch by sucking up salt water, and injecting it with
her long Stork-like beak, into her narrow posterior orifice. Many more things
of this Bird are recorded by Aristotle, Herodotus, Aelian, Pliny, Tully,
Strabo, Mela, and diverse others. Pisidas in a Greek Epigram merrily concludes,
that she is more learned then Galen himself. Perhaps that Physicians from this
Birds uncleanly conveyance, were taught the use of a Clyster-pipe. To which
purpose facetious Alciat has composed an Emblem, which I here will
transcribe, and translate, and submit all to your candid interpretation.

Alciati Emblema 87. Quae rostro, Clystere velut, sibi proluit alvum
Ibis, Niliacis cognita littoribus,
Transiit opprobii in nomen, quo Publius hostem
Naso suum appellat, Battiadesque suum.
Ibis of Nile, that with her beak as't were
A Clyster-pipe, her fundament does clear,
Is an opprobrious name; for Ovid thus
Does call his Foe; so does Callimachus.
J. J.

To his Friend Mr John Jones, Translator of OVIDS IBIS.
MUst I turn Poet too? and dress my lines
To measured feet, and Rythmes in Tropes and signs?
Well, wonder on, I thus should venture on it,
Who n'ere could Poem write, nor juggling sonet;
It seems far worse then madness now in me,
Verses to write in times of scrutiny.
Methinks I see some Mome has with his eye,
Caught these poor lines, and with his fingers try
Whether they hold proportion with their feet;
Not caring much whether with sense they greet:
Searches for Bombast, squeezed Epithites,
And in Seraphick nonsense much delights.
Friend, it is well for thee, my lines do make
Thee forlorn, and the shock of fury take
From off thy work; for else they would rant^ng spend
Their malice all on thee before they would end.
'Twas well thou met'st with such a subject too,
By which thy carelessness thou't fully show,
In case they show their rancour; do not care,
Just as your Poet Ibis spared, them spare.
'Twas Ovid gave the Theme, give him the praise;
But Jones that made the Comment, reach the bays.
'Twas he that made the Roman Eagle air
With his sweet Lure in Albions Isle, the fair,
And made ingenious Ovid speak a tongue,
That he did never so much as think upon.
'Twas not condoling Tristibus thou took'st,
Nor on his waggish Ars Amandi look;
But it is his crabbed Ibis, that in Rythmes
Thou English taught'st in these detracting times;
And do not fear to let detractors see
Themselves in ancient Ibis destiny.
This thy Translation is not Paraphrase;
Nor do thy words his meaning ought disgrace.
Thou do not aim at blustering eloquence,
Rhombissian words, with peaking piteous sense;
But as the Original is pure and clear
So is the Copy, they do close so near;
Where it before sounded all mystery,
Thou Have beautified it with plain history.
Thanks to thy pains and care, I can no more:
Pardon my Muse, it never had guilt before.
Had Ovid heard what I had wrote on's Ibis,
Like Delphian Oracle, he would say Peribis.
Silas Tailor.

To the Author of the Translation of OVID'S Book in IBIN.
AT the first sight your pains did seem to me
A sullen rudeness to Civility:
Bringing by bold attempt, that book to light,
Which was in sable robes condemned to night.
But having read your sober Illustrations,
Moral, Divine, Poetical relations;
I handsomely saw couched what might in short,
Please both the learned and the vulgar sort.
The names of Phasis, Strymon, Hebrus, make
My Muse in Autumn, chilled with cold to quake:
Yours broke muchice, since first you undertook,
To level precipices in this book;
And make aenigma's plain, that all the Nation
Might read a mystery in your Revelation.
Reece Morrys.

To Mr Jo. Jones, Translator, Illustrator and Commentator of Ovids Ibis.
NOr do I weigh what any Mome may think,
(Only I wish his Gall to make me Ink
When I a Satyr write) but now my quill
I Would wish to dip, where Ovids self did fill
His versing pen; for he who had the wit
To teach the art of Love, would practice it;
He, who what e're he thought on to rehearse,
Like Metal in a mould would run to verse;
He Would show himself as grateful unto thee,
As e're to Ibis he could spiteful be;
For thou have enammell'd his cast Poetry,
Making him, Heathen, speak Divinity;
And with choice Jewels ne^^ cut and enchac'd,
His Muse and thine, have jointly, richly graced.
Thou have redeemed him from his long Exile,
And made him Denizon of our English Isle.
The Act is past, but not by public stealth,
He Is Naturalized in our Commonwealth.
But stay, let us see; ( Apollo be my guide)
How many Gordian knots are here untied?
And if the young King, when he cut but one
With His sword, 'twas destiny'd that he alone
Should the World's Monarch be; what honor's fit
For him, who hundreds loosed with sharper wit?
But that this Iron age does wisely afford
Less honor to the Pen, then to the Sword.
Yet stand again, what have I now espied?
After these ravell'd knots thou have untied,
Thou knitt'st again their ends, (an endless pain)
Weav'st them with wists of thine own studious brain;
Then in fresh colors, lively to the eye,
Like Arras work, describ'st each History;
Thus fram'st a piece of curious Tapistry,
May any students study beautify.
Yours still JO. HILL.

To his much honored Mr John Jones, Master of Arts, and Schoolmaster in the
City of Hereford; upon his Translation, Comment, and Observations upon Ovid his
Ibis.
SO Phospher wakes the morn, with grateful light,
Translated from the obscure arms of night;
So Phoebus from a cloud rescues a ray,
At once to lighten and adorn the day.
This Book of all that is Ovid, I do think
Was like the Cuttle, hid in it is own ink;
Each line an History, and as it stood,
Then Ibis self less known or understood.
Thus a fair room in building, where no way
Is left by window to let in the day,
Conceals it is beauty, and by that abuse
Rich to it self, is Poor to every use;
But when the Artist's hand shall let in light,
At once we see with wonder and delight,
Embroideries, Arras, Tissues, we behold
Rich Persian carpets, fringed with pearl and gold;
Then we first praise the riches, when once shown,
Before not understood, because not known.
Here you remove the veil, and let us see
The now known wealth of concealed history;
So fully does your Comment clear your rhimes
By Observations, to our use and times;
That while we suck these flowers, like Bees we do
At once draw pleasure thence and profit too.
While some men leave the Reader more perplexed
With Comments far more hard then is the Text;
Or with a safer ignorance pass by
The ravell'd mysteries it cannot unty.
Others too full of fancy, (while their brain
Runs riot) still decline their proper aim;
So a rank Hobby with unbounded wing,
Wantons in the air, and stoops at every thing.
Your Muse here flies not at so loose a rate,
Whiles others Paraphrase, it is you Translate.
No flyings out, your Muse though free, is bound
To word for word, to render, not confound
The Genuine sense so justly, that we might
Say Ovid's self did dictate, you did write.
No rack here shown to make a word confess
Then what it signifies or more or less:
No virgin Muse here forced, no violence,
Or rape committed upon word or sense;
Each word so fitly married, as if meant
To show you wooed well first, then had consent.
So Adam tranc'd in sleep, did wake from it,
And found an helper for him meet and fit;
Even so, exactly so, we see a face
Translated in a glass, whose every grace,
Each air, each line, each glance, each motion, all
Agree in one, the same Original.
Henceforth it is no more Ibis; you in this
Have made it Ovid's Metamorphosis,
More strange then all his changes, while you frame
A total change, which wholly is the same.
Ed. Bosworth.

OVID'S INVECTIVE, OR CURSE AGAINST IBIS, Faithfully translated, and the
Histories therein contained briefly explained, and variously applied.
NOw fifty of my years are past and gone,
And of my Muse be armed verses none:
Nor, of so many thousands penned by me,
One bloody verse of Naso's could you see,
5. Not one did my book hurt, but me alone,
When the Artist by his Art was overthrown.
One man (and that one thing is mighty wrong)
Cannot endure my Title should live long.
Who e're he be, his name I Will spare; my Muse
10. He has compelled strange weapons now to use.
He does me grudge, exiled to Northern cold,
My banishment in quietness to hold.
My half-cur'd wounds he cruelly does pierce,
And openly my small offense rehearse.
15. He stops her that is my own by Nuptials,
From wailing her poor husbands Funerals.
He, that should first the sudden flames allay,
From midst the fire this Robber seeks a prey.
Of my torn ship few pieces could I save,
20. Yet he, the plank whereon I stand, would have.
He works my banished age may want supply,
Oh! he is more worthy of this misery.
Gods were more kind, of which he is far the chief,
That lets me not, though banished, want relief.
25. Therefore deserved thanks to him I Will give,
For so great favor, where, and whilst I live.
Pontus shall hear this, and perhaps I may
Vow by a nearer place to him, one day.
But thou, that kick'st me being down, against thee,
30. Unto my power a mortal foe I Will be.
Between the fire and water shall be love;
The Sun and Moon shall both in one Sphere move;
One coast shall East and West-winds too send forth,
The Lukewarm South shall blow from freezing North;
New love shall to the brothers flame return,
Which old wrath severed, while their corpse did burn.
E^eocles son of Oedipus king of Thebes by his own mother Jocasta, contracted
with his brother Polynices, that each should yearly reign by course; the first
year ended, Polynices being denied his turn, made war, wherein both were slain,
and the flame of their bodies being burned together, parted.

Wrath once kindled among neighbors is hardly reconciled, but among brothers
scarcely extinguished by death it self, chiefly when a kingdom lies at stake.
Tanta est discordia fratrum ^ yet the brood of incestuous parents are more
bloody then any other.

Spring shall be Autumn, and the Summer shall
Be Winter; Rising of the Sun, the Fall;
E're I Will disarm me, or renew old league
40. Which thou by thy offenses do reneague;
E're this my wrath shall vanish, or my hate,
While time and hours do last, one jot abate.
Such peace between us, while I breathe, I Will keep,
That is between the ravenous wolves and sheep.
45. First I Will by verse encounter, though these feet
For penning martial things are not so meet.
A Champion first on yellow sand makes bright
His spear, before he lists into the fight:
So, sharpened weapons, yet, I will not use,
50. Nor shall my spear thy hateful body bruise;
My book shall not thy name or deeds reveal,
And, who thou art, I will as yet conceal:
But cease, else shall my keen Iambick dart
Shafts dipped in blood of false Lycambes heart.
Lycambes not performing his promise, to marry his daughter Niobole to
Archilochus, the Poet so bitterly inveyed against the father and daughter, in
Iambick verses, that they both hanged themselves.

Critics derive fides from fio, because whatsoever is faithfully promised by
word, should be fully performed in deed. B. Hall Med.
Some promise what they cannot do, as Satan to Christ; Some what they could,
but mean not to do, as the sons of Jacob to the Shechemites: Some what they
meant for the time, but after retreat, as Laban to Jacob, and Lycambes to
Archilochus; so great distrust is there in man, either by impotency, or
unfaithfulness. But let wilful promise-breakers take heed lest they break their
own necks, Dabit Deus his quoque funem.

55. Now as Callimachus did curse his foe,
Ibis, so curse both thee and thine I do;
In stories dark I Will wrap my book, as he;
Although that method's seldom used by me:
His form I Will follow in his Ibis now,
60. And my own wonted fashion disavow:
And of thy name 'cause I Will no mention make,
Do thou the name of Ibis also take.
And, as something of night my verses have,
So let thy life prove black unto thy grave.
65. On New Years day, and on thy birthday, let
All with true lips this book to thee repeat.
Ye Gods of Sea and Earth, and ye with Jove
That better Kingdoms do enjoy above,
Gods of the Sea are Neptune, Castor, Pollux, etc. Gods of Heaven that drink of
Nectar, are Jupiter God of power, to help; Mars God of war, to fight; Apollo
God of wisdom, to counsel; Liber God of wine, to comfort.

To us Christians there is but one God, represented under those fictious names:
He is All in All, our Help, Wisdom, Captain and Comfort.

To me, to me with ears and hearts attend,
And let my prayers have their weight and end.
Hear me O Earth, hear me O boisterous Main,
Hear me O sky, let me your favors gain
O Stars, O Sun most glorious in thy rays,
O Moon, appearing not alike always,
75. O Night renowned for shade, O Triple Fate,
That spin our lives to the appointed rate.
The Gentiles made Night a Goddess, but gave her no Temple, nor sacrifice. She
is painted like a woman, because that sex is more fearful; and so are men by
night more then day: She bears a white child in the right hand, that is Sleep;
and a black one in the left, that is Death.

The three fatal Sisters are Clotho that holds the distaff; Lachesis that spins
the thread of man's life; and Atropos that cuts it off.

(1) There is a threefold estate of man, Birth, Life, Death. Hence the first
Fate is called Nona, because man is born in the ninth month: the second
Decima, because man lives ten times ten years: the third Morta, Death. They
are called Parcae, because Death spares none: They are the daughters of Jupiter
and Themis, God of Heaven, and Goddess of Justice: for Death is Gods just
decree for sin.

Styx, whom the Gods do swear by, that do glide
With murmuring noise through valleys by Hell side.
Styx indeed is a Well in Arcadia, whose water is strong poison, so cold that
nothing can contain it but a Mules hoof; with this Alexander is thought to be
made away by Antipater, not without some aspersion upon Aristotle. The Poets
feign, that this is a river in Hell, and that the Gods did swear by it, which
oath if any brake he was for certain years debarred from Nectar and Ambrosia
the food of Deities.

1. Styx signifies Hate, because men dying begin to hate their former sins.
Heathens durst not take the name of Styx in vain: but Christians take the name
of God in vain; what then may such sinners expect, but to be debarred from
Nectar and Ambrosia, life and immortality?

Furies, whose tresses winding snakes do tie,
80. Who at the gates of that dark prison lie.
The three Furies, Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone, daughters of Pluto and
Proserpina, were called in heaven Dirae, in earth Harpyae, in hell Furiae.

(1) These are taken for the tortures of a guilty conscience, where the
torments of hell begin; or for the commotions of the mind, Covetousness, Envy,
Discord; or for Gods three judgments; Megaera, Plague, sweeping all away;
Alecto, Famine, never satisfied; Tisiphone, Sword, a murderer, and revenger of
sin. These are worshipped, not because they can do good, but lest they should
do hurt.

Fawnes, Satyrs, Lares, Gods of low degree,
Rivers, and Nymphs, and you that half-Gods be.
1. Faunus king of the Latins had a wife called Fauna or Fatua from
prophesying, she read fortunes. Hence foretellers of things are called
Fatuarii, and inconsiderate speakers Fatui. The Faunes are thought to have sent
the disease called Ephialtes, or Nightmare, which Pliny terms Faunorum
ludibria.

Faunus was worshipped as a God for teaching Tillage and Religion; much more
should we worship the true God, that gives all good things. These Gods had
horns to fright men to religion whom reason would not draw, Primus in orb
Deum fecit timor.

2. Satyrs were lascivious creatures, their descent I find not, they were like
the Faunes, with a m^ns head horned, all hairy, with Goats feet; they were
Deified because they should not hurt the catel.

(1) These are but rude rustic clownes, given to drinking, wenching, and
dancing; ^acchus is said to be their companion, because ^ine provokes lust.
This conception of Satyes may proceed from savage men, discovere^ in woods by
the civil, wearing beasts skins on their tawny bodies, with the tail hanging
do^n behind, and horns on their heads, either for ornament, or terror, such
are yet among the West-Indians: Mr Sandys.
to these ignorance and ^ar ascribed a celestial Deity.

3. Lares ^ere begot of Mercury and Lara: Some think, the L^rvae and Lemures to
be the same; they are as Penates Gods of houses, and Lar is painted like a dog,
a good housekeeper, which is kind to the household, fie^e to strangers. Men
sacrificed to him in the ch^ney, hence the house, and so the fire is called La.

(1) Th^se were Gods of low degree among the ancient Romans, and what higher
have the new?

4. Nymphae quasi Lymphae, were Deities of the Waters; if sprung from
Mountains, they were called Oreades; if from Woods and Trees, Dryades and
Hamadryades; if from moisture of flowers, Napeae; if from the Sea, Nereides; if
from Rivers, Naiades.

(1) These Nymphs were daughters of Oceanus, because Rivers return into the Sea
from whence they came: So should we return thanks to God from whence comes all.
These Nymphs are painted spinning; It is no sh^me for a Lady to be a Spinster
or a ^uswife.

(2) In Poets there be Gods of Haven, Earth, Hell, Woods, Waters, etc. T^ show
that Gods power and providence d^ reach unto every place. If I climb to
^eaven, thou art there; if to Hell, thou art t^ere also. Enter, presenter, Deus
hic and ubiq potenter.

Gods old and new, that do remain till now
From the first Chaos, listen to my vow:
85. While against this hateful wretch with c^^rms I pray,
While grief and wrath their several parts di^play.
Gods of each rank, let power my wish att^in,
And let no jot nor point of it prove vain
As I do wish, Gods do; that all may be
90. Thought by Pasiphaes step-son said, ot me.
Theseus son of Aegeus, that took ^ wife Ariadne daughter of Pasiphae, whom
Bacch^ after married, being too credulous to the false acusation of his son
Hippolitus, made by Phoedra ^s Mother-law, prayed Neptune to destroy him; ^e
caused a Sea-calf to startle his Coach-horses, they threw him, dragged him, and
killed him.

(1) If Theseus his curse prevailed against his own son, why not Ovids against
his foe? 2. Note the malice of a Stepmother. 3. Take heed of a parents curse.

Let him endure those pains which I omit,
And let his torments far exceed my wit:
I feign his name, but let my vote no less
Vex him, or with the Gods find less success.
95. He whom I curse goes now on Ibis score,
That knows he has deserved these plagues, and more.
I Will not delay, but speedily proceed
To sacred Rites: all people hear and heed:
Utter such doleful words become a Hearse,
100. And let your faces overflow with tears,
Come to him with bad Omens, and left feet,
Put on such robes as be for Mourners meet.
Ibis put on thy sacrificing weed:*
Here stands the altar for thy death, make speed.
105. The pomp's prepared for thy Obsequies;
Hasten, lay down thy throat, cursed sacrifice.
Earth thee no food, no water streams allow,
A prosperous gale wind on thee never blow;
Let neither Sun nor Moon on thee shine clear,
110. Let no propitious Star to thee appear.
Let Fire and Air deny thee common use,
To yield thee passage Sea and Land refuse.
Wander thou poor and banished, haunt the door
Of strangers, crusts with trembling mouth implore.
115. From grievous pain be soul nor body free;
Be night than day, day worse than night to thee.
Be fit for pity, but still pitiless;
Let man and woman laugh at thy distress.
Let tears gain hate: be thou thought worthy mo^e
120. To suffer, having suffered much before.
And (which is rare) instead of favor, let
The view of thy sad fortune envy get.
Of pain want store, not cause: let panting breath
Of thy tired life, miss long desired death.
125. Then, let thy soul thy tortured corpse forsake,
Yet no great haste in her departure make.
'Twill be: by signs Apollo lately said,
And an unlucky bird on left hand fled.
That day shall ease me which takes thee away,
130. That day shall ease me, though it long delay.
First, this my life much envied by thee,
Shall death cut off, which comes too slow to me;
Before my kindled anger shall decrease,
Or my deserved hate against thee cease.
135. While darts shall Thracians, and while bows shall arm
Jazigs, while Ister's cold, while Ganges warm.
Thracians and Scythians were of old one nation, and were taught by Scythus
Apollo to fight with darts.

Jaziges, people near bordering to Scythia, fought with bows and arrows.

Ister is a river in Germany called Danubius, it runs into the Northern
seas, therefore cold.

Ganges, a river in Scythia, it runs from the East, therefore it is
lukewarm.

While Oak in Woods, while Grass in Medows grow,
While Thuscan Tibris shall with water flow,
I Will fight, nor shall thy death conclude my rage,
140. But with thy ghost fierce skirmishes I Will wage:
And when my breath to air is changed by fate,
Then my revenging ghost thy ghost shall hate;
Yea, then remembering thy old wrongs, I Will dare
A bony shape into thy face to stare.
145. If I by age, which Jove forbid, shall die,
If to be murdered be my destiny,
If ship wracked in the Ocean I shall perish;
And my drowned carcass foreign fish shall cherish,
If ravenous birds shall make my flesh their food,
150. And greedy wolves shall glut them with my blood:
If earth I be vouchsafed, or if some friend
Shall to a simple grave my bones commend:
What e're I be, from Styx I Will break away
And on thy guilty face my cold hands lay.
155. Awake thou shall me see in silent night,
A ghastly shade I will thy sleep affright.
Do what thou will, before thy face I Will fly,
And shreek: in no place shall thou quiet be.
Smart stripes shall sound, before thee hell-brands smoke
160. Tw^sted with snakes, thy damned soul to choke.
These Furies thee alive and dead shall tear:
Thy life's too short all thy deserts to bear.
May thou of burial and of mourning fail,
Cast out with scorn let no man thee bewail.
165. The people shouting, by the hangmans hand
Thou shall be dragged, hooks in thy bones shall stand.
The fire that all consumes shall thee defy,
Just earth to thy base corpse shall room deny.
Vultures but slow, thy guts with beak and claw
170. Shall pluck out, dogs thy perjured heart shall gnaw.
And (though this honor mak^s thee proud) I wish
That wolves may strive who first shall taste thy flesh.
In parts far distant from the Elysian coast,
With damned shades shall dwell thy horrid ghost.
Elysium, or the Elysian fields, was a pleasant place, as some report, between
Britan and Thule, or in the Fortunate Islands; here the souls of good men are
feigned to converse, enjoying all delights, whereof the chief was a fruitful
tree; the way to it was through Acheron, Phlegeton, and other Hell-rivers.

(1) The ancient being ignorant of true bliss, conceived, as the Mahometans do
now, that reward after death consisted in the fruition of sensual delights:
therefore to incite the mind to virtue, invented this fiction of happy fields;
perhaps derived from the Terrestrial Paradise. (2) In Jerusalem above, our
heavenly Paradise, is the tree of life, and pleasures for evermore. Hither we
must pass through fire and water, persecutions and tribulations.

175. There Is Sisyphus, whose stone no ease does feel;
Ixion bound unto a restless wheel.
1. Sisyphus, son of Aeolus, Secretary to Jupiter, a great Robber near the
Corinthian Isthmos, for his treachery in divulging his Lords secrets, and
oppression of men, was killed by Theseus, and cast into hell, where he rolls a
stone up a hill that still tumbles down again.

1. Learn by Sisyphus his torments to keep close the secrets of friends,
chiefly of Princes. 2. Oppress not now on earth, lest you be punished in hell
hereafter. 3. Trust not in wealth and honor; they roll as Sisyphus stone. To
day a high King, to morrow a low Beggar.

2. Ixion, son of Phlegias King of Thessaly, killed his father-in-law, and
after was a vagabond; Jupiter pitied his misery, expiated his crime, and
received him in heaven to his own table; but hearing that he had tempted his
Queen Juno, presented to him a cloud, of which he begat the Centaurs: after he
was thrown to the earth, thence, because he boasted that he lay with Juno, he
was cast into hell, where he was bound to a wheel that still is whirled about.

(1) Though God the true Jupiter has pardoned our sins, and received us to
mercy, we still offend him with spiritual fornication. (2) Covetous and
ambitious men, when they think to enjoy real happiness, they find all like
Ixions cloud. (3) The spirits of Tyrants as Ixion are wracked on the wheel of
restless cares. (4) The Heathens persuaded themselves the soul was immortal.
(5) Ixion having tasted of Nectar could not dye. (6) To what insolences and
preposterous humors does drunkenness provoke? Ixion being drunk presently
lusts for Juno.

And Belides, that husband-killing crew,
That pour and pour, and still their work renew.
Belides, the fifty daughters of Danaus, son of Belus, by the command of their
father were married to fifty sons of their uncle Aegyptus, all whom they killed
in one night, but Hypermnestra saved her husband Lynceus: those murderers in
hell draw water in a sieve which is never filled.

(1) Marriage with too near of kin is both incestuous and unfortunate. (2) What
trust can we repose in others, when friends in our own bosoms shall prove
treacherous, as these wives unto their husbands? (3) Children should obey their
Parents, but not in evil. (4) Covetous, voluptuous, yea, and learned men, the
more they draw, the more they desire. (5) Unthankful and hollow-hearted men are
like these sieves: benefits are lost, secrets do run out of them. (6)
Schoolmasters too often find boys like sieves: they retain nothing which they
learn. (7) All humane endeavors are done, and demolished like water, leaving
no impression behind.

There Tantalus, though apples be at hand,
180. Does starve and in a river thirsty stand.
Tantalus son of Jupiter and Plote, being admitted to the council of the Gods,
revealed their secrets, he was therefore condemned to hell, where in plenty he
is hungry and thirsty, up to the chin in a river, and with apples at his nose:
for the water declines, and the apples fly from him.

(1) See by Tantalus, how dangerous it is to be acquainted with, and how fatal
it is to divulge the secrets of Princes. (2) A serious student, in
contemplation can as willingly abstain from corporal food, as Tantalus against
his will. (3) A rich miser in midst of plenty wants, not only what he has
not, but what he has: I cannot be said to have more then I use, the rest of a
world of wealth can please me no otherwise then by looking on, and so I can
solace my self in the wealth of others.

There Is Tytius that giant long and great,
Whose unconsumed heart is Vultures meat.
Tytius son of Jupiter and Elara was hidden in the earth for fear of Juno,
therefore he was called the son of the earth; he offering violence to Latona,
was tumbled into hell, where his body covers nine acres of ground, and his
heart though eaten by a Vulture grows still.

(1) Corn, like Tytius by Jupiter, that is, the air and the earth, is fomented
and produced, this covers many acres; by the arrows of Apollo, that is, the
Suns beams it is ripened for the Mower, to cut it down; it is eaten by the
Vulture, that is, putrified by moisture, Mr Sandys.
in the heart of the earth, and then grows again. (2) The envious man's heart
is eaten, and grows again, and may be well said to be hell. (3) No man of how
many acres of land soever, of how great power soever, can avoid the hand of
divine justice. (4) The conception of that fable was indeed translated from the
fire of hell, that ever feeds upon the damned, that suffer without diminution.
(5) All these forementioned punishments are Allegorically referred to the
perturbations of the mind. The cares of Love which proceed from the liver,
whose expense is daily repaired; is the Vulture of Tytius. The famine of
Tantalus may be Covetousness. Ixions wheel the circular afflictions of the
guilty for sin past. Sisyphus stone, still toyling ambition: and the Belides
sieve, the unexpliable desires of the soul.

One fury shall thy flesh whip to the bone,
While thou thy faults confessest one by one.
185. One shall thy mangled limbs among Hell-snakes scatter,
The third shall boil thy ugly face in water.
Thy Ghost shall suffer thousand torments; yet
For new supplies shall Aeacus strain his wit.
Aeacus, Rhadamanthus, and Minos, sons of Jupiter, are feigned to be Judges in
hell.

(1) These may signify the three Effects of Conscience, to accuse, condemn,
torment. (2) All Judges are called the Sons of God, as these three were Sons of
Jupiter. (3) Before these three Judges none appeared but naked souls; here we
have something about us that may corrupt an earthly Judge. And it is great
shame that there is more justice in hell then is in earth. (4) Aeacus and
Rhadamanthus were both mild, Minos only cruel. To show that Mercy should
triumph above Justice. Two for one.

Torments of ancient souls he will lay on thee,
190. Ease to old damned spirits thou will be.
Sisyphus thy rolling stone to Ibis give;
Now shall the wheel a new Ixion drive.
He Is that in vain shall catch at streams and fruit,
His heart shall feed the bird, and still recruit.
195. Another shall succeed when one death's past;
Unto thy pains no hour shall be last.
Some few I Will touch, as if from Ida's top
I take a leaf, or from the Sea a drop.
Of Hybla flowers can I the number know;
200. Or Saffron crooks that in Cilicia grow?
Or when sharp winter on the North wings fly,
How many Hailstones upon Athos lie.
Nor can my words count all thy torments now,
Could thou a thousand tongues on me bestow.
205. Such, and so many woes shall thee invade,
That me (I think) to tears they may persuade.
Those tears shall prove long happiness to me,
Sweeter then laughter will that weeping be.
Unluckie wast thou born (so Gods designed)
210. And at thy birth no lucky Planet shined.
Nor Venus, nor did Jupiter appear,
Nor Sun, nor Moon moved in their proper sphere.
Neither did he whom Maia bare to Jove
Smile, with least influence or aspect of love.
215. But those ill-promising and disastrous Stars,
Old crabbed Saturn, and Bloodthirsty Mars.
These are seven Planets: Saturn and Mars, always very bad: Jupiter and Venus
always very good: Sol, Mercury, and Luna ind^fferent, as they are in
conjunction, or aspect with others.

(1) Astra regunt homines, sed regit astra Deus: Stars govern men, but God the
Stars. I think we parents were born under the first two; I hope our children
were born under some of the last.

And thy birthday, lest comfort thou might see,
Was black with clouds, and foul as foul may be.
This day our Calendar did Allia call
220. That brought forth Ibis common plague to all.
The Romans at the River Allia received a bloody blow by Brennus: therefore
they put this day being the 16. of July, in their Calendar among the unluckie.

Too many such Allian days have happene^ within few years past in Europe.

When he from's filthy mothers womb did fall,
First in Cyniphia did this monster crall.
Cynips, or Cyniphos, is a river in Africa, near which are many tall goats:
thither diverse kinds of beasts do come for water, and ingendring together, do
beget monsters.

Such a monster Ovid calls Ibis; he has many kindred in the world.

Near to the place there sat a screetching Owl,
That grievous notes with hideous voice did howl.
225. The Furies him in muddy water dipped,
That from the swarfie lake of Styx had slipped.
His breast smeared over with hellish serpents gall,
Thrice their bloud-stained hands they clapped all.
They season with a Bitches milk his throat,
230. This food they first had for the baby got.
From this dams teat this whelp has fierceness drawn,
Therefore, with dogged words, does bark and yawn.
With iron-coloured clouts they wrap the chit,
Took from base corpse late thrown into a pit.
235. Departing, they a fire of green wood make,
And at his nose the smoky firebrarnds shake:
He wept, when once his tender eyes felt smoke,
And thus one of the Furies to him spoke:
Such tears as now we have provoked, shall,
240. And not without just cause, for ever fall.
Clotho gave her assent this doom should stand,
And spun a cole-black thread with her left hand.
I list not now, quoth she, sum all thy fate,
Ere long a Prophet shall the whole relate.
245. I am that Prophet, I thy destiny
Will read: the Gods fulfill my Prophecy:
Let real weight unto my words accrue,
That by thy torments thou may find them true.
And, lest thy sorrows may example need,
250. Let thine the Trojan miseries exceed.
Troy was a city in Asia the less. Paris, son of Primus King of Troy, took away
Helena wife of Menelaus a Grecian King, and kept her in Troy, therefore the
Grecians besieged the city, and in the tenth year of their siege burned it.

(1) Woeful experience has taught us, by too many a short siege, what
lamentable effects a long one will produce. Lord defend our Troynovant. In wars
without send us peace within.

As Paeans son club'd Hercules his heir,
So in thy thigh a poisoned ulcer bear.
Philoctetes, son of Paean, swore to Hercules, dying on the hill Oe^e, that he
would never reveal his grave; to bind which trust, Hercules gave him his
arrows. Without these arrows Troy could not be stormed. Philoctetes, earnestly
solicited by Ulysses, would not express by words, but gave signs with his
foot, where Hercules was buried. Philoctetes carrying those arrows toward
Troy, was wounded by one of them in that part which divulged the secret.

(1) In trust be just; if thou be executor, perform the will of the Testator:
Much more let Christians keep the covenant in the Testament of Christ, on their
part. (2) Without the arrows of Hercules Troy could not be taken: without the
arrows of Gods judgment for sin, soldiers besiege us in vain, (3) Equivocate
not (as Philoctetes did, and Papists do) by words, nor by signs or tokens. (4)
Though treason prevail, the Traitor is punished. (5) God punishes the member
that sins, as Dives tongue and Philoctetes foot.

Be vexed no less then he that Hind did suck,
Who by an unarmed man, being armed was struck.
Telephus, son of Hercules and Auge, King of Mysia, was nursed by an Hind;
hindering the Grecians army to pass through his Country toward Troy, he was
wounded by Achilles in his thigh: nothing could cure the wound but the rust of
the same spear that gave it, which Telephus desired, and obtained. But some
conjecture that he was cured by the Magnetical ointment applied to the spear.

(1) It is no piece of safe policy in a Prince, to suffer a foreign Prince to
enter into his territories: For give him an inch and he will take an ell. (2)
If an army be terrible to a great kingdom, what may it be to a small Country?
(3) They say the love of a Lady that wounded the heart can cure it, as Achilles
his spear did Telephus; doubtless our offended God can wound by his darts of
judgments, and cure us by his salve of mercy.

255. Or who in foreign parts from horse fell dead,
Whose beauty had his life endangered.
Bellerophon, a comely person, being falsely accused of Antaea or Stenobaea,
wife to King Praetus, for tempting her chastity, was sent by Praetus with
Letters to Jobas, desiring that he would kill him; he employs him against the
Solymi, Chimaera and Amazons: by the help of the winged horse Pegasus, he
overcomes them all. For which noble acts Jobas gave him his second daughter,
and half his kingdom. Antaea hearing of this hanged her self. Bellerophon
proudly mounting his horse toward heaven, fell off and died.

(1) Note the malice of an harlot, missing her aim she will plo^ thy undoing:
Thus Potiphars wicked wife abused honest Joseph; but providence will always
preserve the innocent, and bring to a shameful end their persecutors. A good
Conscience like a brazen wall retorteth all false accusation upon the head of
the enemy. (2) Christians must fight against Solymi, Chimaera and Amazons, the
world, the flesh, and the Devil; and raise their souls on the wings of
meditation, as a Pegasus up to heaven. (3) The Proverb is fully verified in
Stenobaea, Harm watch, harm catch. Envy not prevailing, turns fiercely upon
it self. (4) Some do physically take Bellerophon for the moisture of the earth,
exhaled by the Sun, and falling down again: but the morality of this story may
be this; Pride will have a fall.

Or like Amyntors son, be thou struck blind,
And trembling grope with staff thy way to find.
Phoenix, son of Amyntor, by his Mothers advice, lay with his Fathers
Concubine: for which bold attempt his Father cursed him: he flying to Peleus,
was made Tutor of his son Achilles: he is reported to have first invented the
Greek Letters; but at last he was struck blind.

(1) Climb not thy fathers bed, with Phoenix, and Reuben, lest a curse befall
thee. (2) Follow not thy own mothers counsel to do evil. (3) Take heed to thy
ways, and incur not a parents imprecation: for it happens too often very
fatal.

See thou no more, then whom his daughter led,
260. That killed his Father, did his Mother wed.
Oedipus, son of Laius King of Thebes, and Jocasta, whom the Oracle foretold
should kill his Father, and marry his Mother, as soon as he was born was by his
Father delivered to his shepherd to be killed; the shepherd pitying him, bored
two holes in his feet (whence, he gained the name of Oedipus, that is
swollen-foot) and hanged him on a tree. Phorbas the King of Corinths shepherd
found him, and gave him to his Queen being then childless; when he came to man's
estate, he unawares killed his Father, and married his Mother, which when he
once knew, he plucked out both his eyes, and was led by his own daughter
Antigone.

(1) Let not childless parents repine, or be impatient: better want, then have
a son like Oedipus. (2) Too many, by ill courses, bring their fathers gray
hairs with sorrow to the grave. Therefore Augustus Caesar wished, that he never
had been married, or never been a father. (3) Oedipus repenting, plucked out
his eyes. Eyes are the holes through which sin enters into the soul, yet we
must not follow his example: when our Savior bids us pluck out the offending
eye, the meaning is, that it is better lose an eye, then a soul, better to part
with a sin as dear as thy eye, then lose heaven.

Or that old Judge in the merry case of Jove,
That famous in Apollo's art did prove.
Tiresias, son of Udaeus, one of the five captains that survived the unnatural
war of Cadmus, killing of a female Serpent, was turned to a woman; long after,
killing a male, was turned into a man again Being a fit and elected Judge
between Jupiter and Juno, he gave this sentence, That the woman had nine ounces
in the vigor of Love, and the man but three; therefore Juno deprived him of his
sight, which Jupiter supplies with the gift of Prophecy.

(1) Histories (if we may believe them) tell us, that some women have been
turned to men, not men to women. (2) Tiresias judgment between Jupiter and
Juno, was in this kind just; as Jupiter is taken for the element of fire, and
Juno for the air: For the air confers thrice as much as the fire to the
generation of vegetables; moisture yielding the chiefest part of the materials,
and heat producing form and maturity. Nor, without cause, among Grammarians,
are the two superior elements, Fire and Air, of the masculine gender, and the
two inferior, Earth and Water, Feminine; because the superior have
predominancy over the inferior, as the husband has or should have over his
wife. (3) As Tiresias was both male and female: so are turn-coats, hodie mihi,
cras tibi, to day mine, to morrow thine; So is the multitude, Neutrum modo, Mas
modo vulgus. (4) Many that are blind in body are quick-sighted in their mind,
as Tiresias. (5) When a great power, as Juno, does oppress us, a greater, as
Jupiter, may relieve us. Saepe premente Deo, fert Deus alter opem. Lucian
reports that Tiresias is feigned to be male and female, among the Grecians,
because he divided the wandering stars into male and female.

Or he be whose devise a Dove was guide,
Where Pallas ship should on the Ocean ride.
Phineus, son of Agenor, had by Cleopatra two sons, Orythus and Crambus, whose
eyes by the counsel of his second wife Idaea he plucked out; in revenge whereof
the Gods plucked out his. He advised the Argonauts to follow the Dove which
Pallas should send, and so avoid the rocks called Symplegades.

(1) Phineus may be feigned to have lost his sight, because he was so blind
with avarice, that he could not look unto himself, nor afford necessaries unto
life, which is contented with a little. (2) Stepmothers, like Idaea, seldom
love the children of a former wife: Injusta noverca. (3) Retaliation is a just
judgment of God, an eye for an eye. (4) Parents that blind their Children with
ignorance, not allowing them education, God will punish; so that the blind
shall lead the blind. (5) Let every Elymas that blind men's souls and draw them
from the faith, expect not only corporal blindness, but utter darkness. (6)
If you will avoid the offensive rocks of schism and heresy, follow the true
Pallas, Christ, the wisdom and the Dove which he has sent, the spirit of
truth, so will you safely arrive at the haven of heaven: Mean time, from
blindness of heart good Lord deliver us.

265. Or he whose eyes, the infants Gold surpised,
Which to her son the mother sacrificed.
Polymnestor, King of Thracia, received into his Guardianship (with a vast
sum of money) Polydorus son of Priamus King of Troy; whom when Troy was
sacked, coveting the money he inhumanely killed. Hecuba, mother of the child,
sent for Polymnestor, pretending to deliver him another sum, when he came,
she scratched out both his eyes.

(1) Guardians should be defenders, not destroyers of their Pupils. (2)
Covetousness is the root of all evil. (3) No sin comes single, Robbery and
Murder will hang together. (4) The natural, much more the violent death of a
child moves a mother to impatience.

As Aetna's shepherd whose blind fate of old,
One Telamus Eurymons son foretold.
Polyphemus was a shepherd on the hill Aetna, and chief of the Cyclopes, he had
one eye in his forehead, which Ulysses put out with a firebrand, when he had
besotted him with wine, after he had eaten four of his men, that came to lodge
in his cave. One Telamus prophesied his misery. These Cyclopes made
thunderbolts for Jupiter, and chariots for Mars.

(1) Injustice armed with power is most outrageous and bloody; but Polyphemus
was more savage then the West Indians, these eat but their enemies only, he
his guests. (2) These Cyclopes may be evil spirits, whose service God sometimes
does use in raising thunder and storms, to punish the wicked; Polyphemus, or
Beelzebub is the chief, he devoured Ulysses men, that is, mankind; but the
true Ulysses, Christ, pouring into him the red wine of his wrath, thrust out
his eye, restrained his power. When Polyphemus the shepherds eye is blind, what
a blind guide has the sheep? (3) When there was no King in Israel, the light
was quenched, the Eye was out, then followed intestine wars, and Vulcans sons
did work for Mars.

Like Phineus sons, whose eyes one gave and took,
270. Like Thamyras, and Demodocus look.
Orythus and Crambus their eyes by their Stepmothers counsel were plucked out
by their own father Phineus, whom divine vengeance after blinded for his
unnatural cruelty, and sent Harpyes to eat his meat, and defile his table.

(1) Mark the just judgment of God upon an unmerciful father, provoked by the
false suggestions of a femal night-crow. (2) These Harpyes might be covetous
desires, not suffering him to eat what was set before him; himself polluting it
with his own sordid disposition.

2. Thamyras, or Thamyris, a Poet, and Musician, comparing himself with the
Muses for skill, was deprived of his harp and sight.

(1) Boldness puts men forth before their time, they run before they are sent,
like Lapwings, with some part of the shell upon their heads: so it follows, as
they began presumptuously, they proceed unprofitably, and end not without
shame; every man condemning them of arrogance and ignorance: and indeed these
are inseparable twins, for, who is bolder then blind Bayard? as the proverb
passes.

3. Demodocus was an admirable harper, but he was blind.

(1) No man is so happy to have all gifts, no man is so miserable but to have
some: Of the two I had rather be blind Homer, with his acute mind, then
nimble-eyed Lynceus with his obtuse capacity. (2) Note that Ovid wishes to
Ibis, not any of these men's good qualities, but blindness.

Let one thy members crop, as Saturn that
Wherewith his ancient father him begat.
Saturn son of Coelum and Thetis, cut off his fathers testicle^, the blood
whereof engendered the Furies.

(1) Saturn, that is Time, cut off the genitals of Caelum, that is heaven;
because the heavens at last shall grow old, and by time shall lose the power of
generation. (2) Gelders of ancient Records, Fathers and Scripture, rebel
against heaven like Saturn; and hence proceed those Furies of Heresy,
Dissension and Schism.

To thee let swelling Neptune prove the same,
As him whose wife and brother birds became.
Caeyx King of Thracinia, son of Lucifer, his brother Daedalion being turned to
a hawke, went to the Oracle, promising his wife Halcione, to return with speed;
She seeing his dead body in the sea, would have drowned herself, but the Gods
turned her into a Kings-fisher, and him into a Sea-mew.

(1) When the Halcions lay eggs, the sea is calm; hence peaceable days are
called Halcionian, or Alcian days. (2) Alcione was the daughter of Aeolus that
could imprison the winds; and a dead Kings-fisher hanged up by the beak will
turn her belly to the wind. (3) The Male and Female accompany all the year, not
for lust but love. I wish no less modesty and love in all married people. (4)
Moderate sorrow for friends is comely; immoderate dangerous; it made Halcione
desperate. (5) These Halcions were begot of the Morning Star Lucifer, and
calmed the sea, but some soul birds in the world, begot of hellish Lucifer, do
raise storms and disturb the sea of the State, laying eggs of dissension, and
fishing in troubled waters.

275. Or the wise man on shipwrack'd plank that sat,
Whom Semele's sister did compassionate.
Ino sister of Semele, advised Ulysses to leave the ship and trust to swimming,
offering him an immortal ribband to gird his paps; he refused her counsel, but
at last being shipwrack'd, he betook himself to a plank, and so was saved.

(1) Ino was called Matuta, Goddess of the sea and the morning, perhaps
because the morning seems to rise out of the sea; she is feign^d to appease the
sea, because winds that rage by night use to fall in the morning. (2) The World
is a sea; the Church is a ship, if we leave this ship, we may be drowned
eternally; when the Church is torn in pieces by schisms and heresy, we must
not leave it so, but hold fast to one plank, where two or three are gathered
together in the name of Christ, keeping the ribband, the bond of love and unity.

And left this kind of death but one should know,
At two horse tails in pieces drawn be thou.
Metius Suffetius, General of the Albans, stood with his army, expecting the
event of the battle between the Romans, with whom he was in league, and the
Fidenates; on purpose to incline to the prevailing party. Tulbus Hostilius
having got the day, condemned Metius to be drawn in pieces between two horses.

(1) True valor does more respect and honor a professed constant foe, then an
unconstant ambodexter friend: Pietas and in host probatur. (2) As Metius being
alive was in mind between two, so is he in body being dead. Thus commonly
Jack-on both-sides come to an untimely, untoward end. (3) Pretend not God, and
intend the Devil; serve not God for Baalams wages of iniquity. (4) Too many
have fought, not so much for the Cross of Christ, as of the Coin. Cruxillos
maneat.

Die thou as he whom Carthage soldiers caught,
280. That seorn'd a Roman should be changed or bought.
Marcus Attilius Regulus Consul of Rome, was in battle taken captive by the
Carthaginians, and sent to Rome to return their captives in exchange for him;
he disswadeth the Romans, and returns to the enemy, they cut off his
eyelids, that he might not sleep, and put him in an hollow tree full of sharp
nails; there he died.

(1) One pearl is of more value then Millions of barley corns. One Sun more
glorious then a numerous company of Stars. One wise and magnanimous Leader is
of greater price then a numberless army of common-souldiers: such an one will
rather endure a torturing death, then live, that his Country may thereby
suffer disgrace or damage. (2) Heroic valor is more expressed by dying
honorably, in a good cause, then saving his life, by a base submission, upon
dishonorable terms. (3) A mature final battle has been accounted less
disadvantagious then frivolous delay by exchange of captives. (4) When our
enemies take off our eyelids, our eyes are made the more open to behold the
heavens. (5) Persecutors are as pricks in our sides: Lord prick their hearts to
repentance.

Gods thee assist, no more, then the Altar did
Of Jove Hyrcaeus him that there was hid.
Priamus King of Troy fled to the Altar of Jupiter Hyrcaeus; whence Pyrrhus
dragged him by the hair of the head, and slew him.

(1) Princes are subject to mutability and misfortunes, as much, if not more,
then subjects. (2) Bloodthirsty Ravilliacks fear neither God, nor Man, respect
a Prince no more then a Peasant, regard a Temple as little as a Tavern (3)
Smite the Shepherd and the sheep will be scattered. Fight not against small or
great, but against the King, 2 Chronicles. 18.30. An Helmet is safer then a Crown to
defend the head.

As from mount Ossa Thessalus was thrown,
So headlong from a rock be thou cast down.
Thessalus, King of Thessala, most courteously entertained a stranger called
Euryalus: Walking together on the hill Ossa, Euryalus thence cast him down and
killed him, and so possessed his kingdom.

(1) Some heretofore in the shape of strangers have entertained Angels, but
some, since, have in the form of Angels of light entertained worse then
Euryalus. (2) Cherish not a snake in thy bosom, lest it sting thee to death.
(3) Ambition does think Aceldama the nearest way to a throne. (4) Ingratitude
was the first of sins, and is the worst. Call a man unthankful, and then tell
him what you will. Si ingratum dixeris, omnia dixeris.

285. As of Euryalus th'Usurper, let
The flesh of thee to greedy snakes be meat.
Euryalus, that killed King Thessalus, had his head eaten with Snakes.

(1) Divine justice will not suffer murder, chiefly of a kind and noble
Thessalus, to be unrevenged. (2) These snakes may be torments of the soul for
sin. What joy is it, with Damocles to enjoy all things, that may content all my
senses, when the point of a naked sword lies at my throat, or which is far
worse, a sting in my conscience* A good conscience is a continual feast, and a
bad one a perpetual hell. From bloud-guiltiness good Lord deliver us.

Let scalding water poured on thy pate,
As Minos, hasten thy appointed sat.
Minos King of Crete married Pasiphae: a Bull by means of a wooden Cow made by
Daedalus, had carnal commerce with the Queen. Daedalus fearing the Kings
revenge, flies to Cocalus King of Cilicia; Minos pursues him, and is kindly
entertained by Cocalus: The daughters of Cocalus, pouring water upon his head
in the Bath, killed him.

(1) Though Minos, for his equity and strict life on earth be feigned to be
Judge in hell, he had a loose Queen to his wife on earth. And indeed the
Proverb is as true as trivial; The honester man the worse his luck. (2) The
history of Pasiphae runs thus. A captain named Bull, incontinently used the
Queen: Mars affects Venus: A soldier aims at the fairest mark (that is no
Bull.) (2) Many pats have been scalded with the daughters of Venus, and live
longer then Minos, but it was hot service. (3) Be not so unhospitable to
entertain a stranger and kill him; that is the part of a Crocodile.

Or as Prometheus fierce, not free, thy blood
290. To lofty Eagles be continual food.
Prometheus son of Iapetus and Themis, because he made a man of clay, and stole
fire from heaven to put life into him, was by Jupiter bound to a pillar on the
hill Caucasus, where an Eagle eats his heart, which daily renews, and
Pandora's basket of miseries do afflict him.

(1) Prometheus might be an Astronomer, that upon the hill Caucasus continually
looked on the Celestial fires, that is the Stars, and observed the motion of
the Sun, and so his heart was eaten with cares and studies. (2) Man may be
called Promethus, for of all sublunary creatures Man is most prudent, and
provident; yet none more subject to Pandora's box of miseries then Man, none
more eaten with the Eagle of cares then Man. (3) Prometheus is said to have
first found out the use of fire among men, therefore after death, is honored
with Festivals; as Vulcan the God of Fire, and Ceres the Goddess of Corn. To
this (me thinks) alludeth that simple (I wish not sinful) Ceremony in some
parts of England, upon St Clements night, among Brewers, Bakers, Smiths, and
such hot artificers. But Morally, Prometheus as the word imports, is the Mind
foreseeing things to come, with prevention of evil. Epimetheus is Knowledge
after events, whose daughter is Repentance. Hence came the Proverb, Praestat
esse Prometheum, quam Epimetheum. Better beforehand to prevent, then after to
repent.

Be slain and drowned like Etracides,
The fifteenth by descent from Hercules.
Etracides (concerning whose right name many cavil) lovingly entertained one
Cleba, son of Dorus, affording him all things necessary; but in the end this
unthankful guest slew his so courteous friend.

(1) It is most horrid and devilish ingratitude to take life from him that
preserved ours. Jupiter, the feigned God of heaven is called Hospitalis. It was
a heinous offense to the Gods for the host to kill his guest, how much more
heinous for the guest to kill his host?

As to Amantus son, a boy with hate
And sword, thy lustful love remunerate.
Archelaus the twelfth King of Macedonia, was slain by a boy called Cratera,
whom he too lasciviously affected.

(1) The least offense or transgression in a Prince, is like a great Mole in
the face, more conspicuous then in any other part; much more is open
Lasciviousness, most of all that unnatural sin of man with man, called Sodomy.
To this abominable vice the people of Hispaniola were addicted. Purchase.
But this loathsome sin had among the Turks this loathsome punishment; they cut a
hole in the panch of a new killed beast, and thrusting the offenders head into
this dung-wallet, they carried him about the towns in pomp. Dignum patella
operculum.

295. Let treacherous cups be mingled unto thee,
As him that son of horned Jove would be.
Alexander the great Monarch of the word, became so proud by his victories,
that he affected to be called the son of Jupiter Hyrcaeus, or Hammon; he was
excessively given to wine; at last he was poisoned by his own butler Iola.

(1) Jupiter is horned, because in a Rams shape he procured water for thirsty
Bacchus, therefore Bacchus built him a Temple and an Image like a Ram. But
proud men may better be called the sons of Lucifer the Devil, then of Jupiter a
God. Pride is a worm that eats down the tallest gourds of honor; one dram of
it poisons a great measure of virtues. Let us not be more afraid of doing good
things, then of pride when we have done them well. (2) A drunkard is worse then
a beast, for a beast will drink no more then will do him good; and how can he
be a ruler of men, that is not his own man, nay scarce a man? It is not for
kings to drink wine, it is not for Princes to drink strong drink, Prove. 30.4.

Die as Achaeus whom his subjects took,
And hanged him headlong in the golden brook.
Achaeus King of Lydia, because he exacted more then ordinary tributes, was by
his subjects hanged with his head downward, in the river Pactolus, whose
streams are feigned to be golden. Now Midas having obtained of Bacchus, that
all he touched might be gold, was almost famished; for his food became gold; by
Bacchus counsel he washed himself in this river and was restored; Since the
streams are feigned to be golden.

(1) Pactolus may be called golden, because it enriched the Country by
watering it; or because Midas spent much money in cutting it into small
streams. (2) Nothing can quench the flame of the high hill Chymera but only
earth, nothing can satisfy the muddy thoughts of the covetous mind but the
grave; like a hog, he is never good till he be hanged by the heels. The
unsati^fied disease of this dropsy of covetousness drives a man on beyond
reason or justice to cover more and more, till this man of metal, like a Tinker
breaks his back with his own budget. (3) If any Publican has exacted or
extorted, better for him, with Zacheus, restore it fourfold, then with Dives
hang in the lake of fire.

As once Achilles Nephew whom they call
300. Famous, a foe thee with a tilestone mall.
Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, at the siege of Argos, was wounded by a tilestone off
the wall, thrown by a woman's hand upon his head. He was s^rnamed Clarus, for
his valor.

(1) It is foolhardy rashness, chiefly for a General, to venture too nigh a
besieged wall, for he is not sure of a safe retreat and to come scot-free to
his tent; witness Hereford. (2) Providence may guide a Woman's hand to do more
then a whole Army; as Judith to Holophernes; Jael to Sisera. (3) When thy
spiritual enemies shall besiege thy soul, take up Christ the cornerstone, the
seed of the woman, he will bruise the serpents head.

Thy bones (like Pyrrhus) shall have rest no where,
That on the Ambracian coast dispersed were.
Pyrrhus son of Achilles, was slain by Orestes, Virgil. 3. Aen.
and his bones were scattered in Ambracia, a coast of Epirus.

(1) It is a most noble act in a conqueror to vouchsafe his conquered foe an
honorable grave, if not a monument; For the glory will be his as much, yea
more then the dead persons. So it is most sordid cowardice to tear a carcass,
or abuse the dead in word or deed.

Defuncti tumulum turpis Hyaena fodit.
Hyaena that most filthy beast
Digs up the graves of men at rest.
Or as Achilles Niece let darts thee kill,
This sacrifice will pease Dame Ceres well.
The last of Pyrrhus blood was Nereis and Laodamia; the younger in a tumult,
though she fled to the Altar of Ceres, was slain by one Milo, for which the
Goddess plagued that Country; the murderer fell mad, cut his flesh, and within
few days died.

(1) It was forbidden the Jews by the law of Moses, to prosecute him that was
unwillingly guilty of killing his neighbor, if he fled to a city of Refuge;
how heinous then is it to murder the guiltless even at the Altar? (2) For one
man's offense a whole Country may be punished, but the offender manifold. (3)
In tumults and troubles fly unto God, the best sanctuary and refuge in
distress. (4) If I must be slain, let me be slain in my prayers.

305. As Nephew to that King of whom I spoke,
Thy Mothers hand thee with Cantarides choke.
Nereis wife of Gelon King of Cilicia, with green venomous worms, named
Cantarides, poisoned her own son Magnates, because he would not yield to her
horrid provocation to lust.

(1) Covetousness and lust admit of no bounds or limits; the one will rob a
father of money, the other a son of chastity. (2) In all carnal temptations,
resolve upon the question with honest Joseph; How can I do this great
wickedness and sin against God?

A whore by stabbing thee may honor gain,
As she by whom was faithless Leucon slain.
Leucon committed adultery with the wife of Oxilocus, who was his own brother,
and in hope to enjoy the kingdom, killed the King; in revenge the Queen killed
him; for which fact she was called Pia.

(1) Hunters knowing that the Panther much desires the poysonful Aconite,
Dallington. Aph.
do hang it up in vessels above their reach, they g^eedily leap and strain
themselves, and so are taken; so do ambitious men that aim at honor too high
for their reach, and too great for their merit. For a heart overgrown with
this r^nk poison, neither admits the beams of grace to mollify the hardness,
nor the bounds of nature to restrain the swelling, but is unnaturally carried
on to wrong those of his own blood. (2) Unchaste love does justly turn to
revenging hate.

Thee and thy best things int' a bone-fire send:
310. Sardanapalus so his life did end.
Sardanapalus the last King of Assyria, was so effeminate that he blushed not
to spin with Harlots, in a woman's habit; being conquered in battle, he fled to
his Palace, where he made a fire, and therein burnt himself and all that he had.

(1) Venery is the mother of Misery. (2) When the head is weak, the body cannot
be strong; Like King like People. (3) Sardanapalus lived basely, died nobly;
but Furor est, ne moriare, mori. It is a desperate madness to avoid death by
killing my self. (4) Many as Balaam would gladly die the death of the
righteous, but live not the life of the righteous. Qualis vita, finis ita.
Those that live ill, seldom die well; A good life seldom meets a bad death.

Let whirlwind sands thee suffocate, as those
That Hammons Temple to pluck down arose.
Cambyses King of the Medes, sent an army to demolish the temple of Jupiter
Hammon; but all the soldiers were destroyed by storms and sands.

(1) Jupiter Hammon may be the same with Ham, Sandys Met.
son of Noah, who was the original of Idolatry, he on his helmet wore the
carved head of a Ram. Or Hamon may be the Sun, from Hamah, which in Hebrew
signifies heat; and because the year begins in March, when the Sun enters into
Aries, he is painted with Rams horns. (2) If so fearful judgments fell upon
those that sought to destroy the temple of a false God, how will those be
plagued that demolish the temples of the true God? Nay what may they expect
that pluck down the Living temples of the holy Ghost, their own bodies and
souls by riot?

Hot ashes thee consume, as them who thus
Died, by the fraud of second Darius.
Ochus, who was also called Darius secundus, feasted all those that had
assisted him in his faction, in a room wherein was a trap-door, under which
were hot ashes; the guests being drunk, the trap was opened, and they all fell
into the ashes and were smothered.

(1) The treason is loved, not the Traitor. When accomplices have acted their
part, and the design is accomplished, they smell like a close stool in the
nostrils of the projector. (2) Sweet meat has sour sauce. Feast-makers do
oftentimes invite their guests to trap them in their words, sometimes to
undermine their livelihood, perhaps their lives.

315. As upon Olive-bearing Sycions King,
Let cold and hunger death upon thee bring.
Neocles King of Sycion, a city in Laconia, abounding with Olive trees, for
cruelty, exaction and oppression was deposed, and not long after died with cold
and hunger.

(1) Golden was that Symbol of the prudent Emperor. A good shepherd will
rather fleece then fley his sheep: By the first he will have wool every year,
by the other but once. Silly was the plot of that covetous woman, that in hope
of a great treasure, killed her hen that laid her every day a golden egg. (2)
Milk-purse Lawyers (so Erasmus terms them) are far more tolerable then
Cutpurse tyrants. (3) Pharisaical oppressors seldom miss their just reward
alive: after death their souls are feigned to enter into Asses, so to be
crushed with such burdens as they laid on others.

As Acarnides that in Bulls-hide lay;
Be thou so brought unto thy Lord a prey.
Hermias son of Acarnus, taken captive by Memnon, was sewed in the hide of a
new-slain Bullock, and fed under his table till vermin killed him.

(1) A noble conquest may be too much blemished by ignoble deportment toward
the conquered. (2) The All-seeing Eye, not blind Fortune, gives the victory,
the Lord of Hosts the All-able hand is stronger then Reason or Means. Hodie
mihi, cras tibi, To day mine, to morrow thine. Do therefore to others as thou
would be done to. Renowned Caesar wept on the dead body of Pompey. It is
inhumane, sarcasmically to insult over a captive, as a Cat over a Mouse.
Advancement shows the man; the higher the Ape climbs, the more she shows her
naked parts.

Or as Pheraeus, be thou stabbed in bed,
320. Whom with a sword his new wife murdered.
Alexander Pheraeus loved his wife Thebe very well, yet before he would go in
unto her, he commanded some of his guard to search if any weapon were in the
chamber, fearing she would slay him. Afterward suspecting him of Adultery she
killed him.

(1) Jealousy is the daughter of extreme love, and mother of extreme hate. (2)
A wife is an earthly heaven or hell. (3) Fear of death is worse then death it
self. (4) More danger is in an homebred conspirator, then a foreign enemy.
Injury from a bosome-friend strikes deeper then from any other. That stab from
Brutus cut Caesar to the heart. (...); what thou my son?

Let those thou think faithful, by a wound,
As to Alebas, false to thee be found.
Alebas King of Larissa, ruled with much cruelty, and for his safety chose a
guard of valiant men, who at length slew the King.

(1) The strongest and safest guard for a Prince (next to a good conscience) is
the free and faithful love of loyal subjects. (2) Divine justice so abominates
a cruel King, that he makes the best defense wherein he trusted to become most
offensive to him, and the spils of the staff on which he leaned to run into his
hands. (3) Man was made to be as a God to man, but he becomes a Wolf, a Devil;
so was Judas to his Lord and Master. Pernicies homini quae pessima? solus homo
alter.

As Milo that did Pisa long torment,
Alive into the sea be headlong sent.
Milo King of Pisa, showed himself most unmerciful in exactions; wherefore the
people rebelling, tied a stone about his neck and drowned him.

(1) It is a more Princely thing to enrich then to be rich. (2) Free subjects
are like smooth streams running in their ancient channel, if any dam or
obstacle stop them from enjoying their wonted liberties and immunities, they
swell the higher, at last they break down, carry away and drown all the
opposing matter.

325. As Adimantus the Philesian King,
So Jove his thunderbolts upon thee fling.
Adimantus King of Philesia, scorning to offer sacrifice to Jupiter, but
braging that he was mightier then he, was struck with a thunderbolt.

(1) For a man to make comparison with another man is odious, with God impious
and damnable. Give unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the
things that are Gods. Give him the honor due unto his name. Omne sub regno
graviore regnum. The highest earthly King is under a higher, and to him he
owes service and homage. His service is perfect freedom, he that denies
this, will be a reprobate slave to sin and Satan. Better submit to his golden
Scepter, then be bruised by his iron rod. It is a fearful thing to fall into
the hands of the living God.

As Dionysius from Amastrix gone,
Thou in Achilles course be left alone.
Dionysius (or Lerneus) King of Heraclia, being banished by Mithridates from
Amastrix, a city built by his wife Amastrix, fled to a place called Achilles
course, whither Achilles had pursued Iphigenia, and there forsaken by his
friends, was slain.

(1) Princes exiled may expect more danger and less comfort then a private
person. Pliny reports that the river Novanus in Lumbardy runs over the banks at
Midsummer, and is dry in Winter. Prosperity finds too many friends, Adversity
few or none. Whosoever revolts was never a friend.

Thrice with Eurydamas 'bout Thrafill's urne,
330. Let Larissean wheels thy carcas turn.
Eurydamas that slew Thrasillus King of Larissa, in a tumult, was afterward
killed by Simo the Kings brother, and three times dragged about Thrasillus
grave.

(1) In a rabble of the giddy multitude, a sovereign Prince is sooner destroyed
then a sturdy peasant. (2) One viol set in tune, and hanged in a room with
others, being touched, the rest do smpathize with a grumbling sound. Thus the
sensitive tree, if ye touch one leaf the whole tree will quake. Injury offered
to a brother will move compassion, and revenge. We may-seek retaliation of
blood for blood; that in a right way is warrantable. But insultation upon a
dead foe is most ignoble. Instant morientibus ursi. The magnanimous Lion scorns
to touch a liveless creature.

Like him whose corpse we dragged about Troy's wall,
Which he long kept, which after him did fall.
Hector son of Priamus and Hecuba, the most valiant Captain of all the Trojans,
slew Patroclus, and the best of the Grecian Captains; at last he was slain by
Achilles, and dragged about the walls of Troy, shortly after his death Troy was
taken.

(1) Cut off the head, how can the body move? Smite the shepherd and the sheep
will be scattered. A thousand of soldiers amount not to the value of one wise
valiant Chief, a trusty Trojan. The loss of an heroic Hector is the fall of a
kingdom. Except the Lord keep the city, the watchmen watch in vain. When the
Lord of hosts leaves Jericho, rams horns may blow it down.

Strange death Hippomedes daughter suffered,
Horses through Athens hale th'adulterer dead.
335. When tired life thy limbs forsake, a nag
Along the ground thy loathsome carcass drag.
Hippomenes King of Athens, having found his daughter Limone guilty of
adultery, shut her up with an hungry horse, which at last devoured her; and the
adulterer was dragged at the horse tail along the streets: for which horrid
fact the King was banished.

(1) Adultery is a beastly sin, and capital among Jews and Heathen, but among
some Christians it is more often threatened then punished; because perhaps the
executioner of justice cannot without fear of a recoil, cast the first stone.
(2) Children have covered the nakedness of their father (witness Noah, Genesis
19.) why may not a father do so to his child? though in conscience he cannot
cover the sin, he may for his credit cover the shame; and upon hopeful signs of
conversion, endeavor a pardon from God and Man. (3) The love of parents is
extreme, too indulgent, or too impatient. A passionate father is no competent
judge upon an offending child. Parents provoke not your children to wrath, Ephesians.
6.4. much less, in your proeoved wrath destroy a child, lest your father which
is in heaven destroy you for it.

Be split upon a rock as many a Greek,
Upon Caphareus in the Eubaean Creek.
Nauplias in revenge of his son Palamedes, who by the false accusation of
Ulysses was put to death, made great lights on the promontory Caphareus in
Euboea, whither the Grecians returning from Troy struck sail, taking it for a
haven, and there perished.

(1) A spring naturally descends, not ascends, so is love between the ancestors
and posterity. No child or grandchild can so dearly love their progenitors as
they do them. It appears by Nauplias. (2) The new ignis fatuus of false lights
have shipwracked the tender consciences of too many silly women and men laden
with sin, upon the offensive rocks of Schism and Heresy, more then Caphareus.

As Ajax died by thunderbolt and Sea,
340. Let fire assist the water to drown thee.
Ajax Oileus after the siege of Troy, returning home, lustfully and profanely
forced Cassandra in the Temple of Pallas, and was therefore justly shot to
death by a thunderbolt, and drowned in the Sea.

(1) When a soldier is unbraced of the arms of Mars, he is quickly embraced
in the arms of Venus: Of idleness comes no goodness. A Bird sitting, not
flying, is shot by the fowler. Water standing, not running, gathers filth. By
doing naught we learn to do naught. (2) Gods presence is every where, but more
perpendicularly in his Temple. Holiness becomes his house for ever. (3)
Spiritual fornication consenting to Satan, in a wandering or a wicked thought
is sinful any where, but in that holy place it is all one as if the woman
should act the filthy sin before her husbands face. But corporal fornication
under that sacred roof, is not only heathenish but devilish. For it does at
once defile both the Material and spiritual temple of that jealous God. And
double sin, double punishment.

Let Furies wrack thy mind, be thou as mad
As he that one wound in his body had.
Marcyas son of Hyagnis the Musician, was so proud of his skill, that he
presumed to challenge Apollo, and scorning to yield, had his skin plucked over
his ears.

(1) The Frog in the fable, stretching to be as great as the Ox, burst to
pieces. Thrasonian prodigals, that wear whole Lordships on their backs, at once
straining to be Lords, leap out of their skins, like puddings, and at last
become scarce worth a pudding. If thou have learning and art proud, I suspect
thy learning; what have thou that thou have not received? and if thou have
received it, why boastest thou?

As Dryas son that Rhodopes kingdom held,
Who cut his legs when harmless vines he felled.
Lycurgus King of Thrasia, son of Dryas, perceiving that some of his subjects
were too much given to wine, commanded all vines in Thracia to be cut down.
Hence the Poet feign that Lycurgus, because he envied Bacchus Wine for his
sacrifice, fell mad, and cut his own shins.

(1) Harm watch, harm catch. Vinum immodice haustum est venenum, modice
divinum, (especially to a Poet.) (2) God saw all things which he made to be
very good, Genesis 1. and gave wine to make glad the heart of man, Psalm. 104. why
then should an abuse by one or few, extirpate the use of a creature? shall wine
be a sin because Noah was drunk? One of the first and best Saints was advised
by his Ghostly Father to drink a little wine, 1 Timothy 5. Why then should the dry
Goatly Fathers of his Holiness rob their Lay-children of their due share in
that cup of blessing in the Sacrament? They may as well make them vow with the
Reckabites not to drink wine for ever.

345. Oetous and Dragons son in law be thy fate,
Tissamens Father and Callirhoes mate.
1. Hercules suspected by his wife Dejanira that he loved Iole more then her,
sacrificing on the hill Oete, in a garment dipped in the blood of the Centaur
Nessus, sent as a token by his wife, fell mad and burned himself.

(1) Women's Jealousy is like their Lust, and both like the fire of hell,
unquenchable. Some think that Dejanira sent her husband that token, not in
revenging hate, but to gain his love. So often an ill event follows a good
intent. Thus a cockering mother kills her best beloved child with kindness.
Thus the Ape by hugging strangles her dearest darling.

2. Athamas husband of Ino, daughter of Cadmus, that was turned to a Serpent,
having in his madness killed his son Learchus, at last killed himself.

(1) Unreasonable creatures do not only procreate, but preserve their issue,
why then should man be so mad with reason, to murder his own child? (2) Let us
strive to give deadly wounds to our sins, those bastards begot by the Devil
upon our flesh. Happy is he that can dash these Babylonish brats against the
stones.

3. Senec. Trag.
Orestes father of Tissamenus, son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, having killed
his mother that committed adultery with Aegysthus, fell mad.

(1) If a parent sins, how dare a child or any private person take up the
public sword to punish? This Matricide Orestes ran mad after the fact:
Parricides voluntarily are mad before. The end of such is by their own or by
another hand.

4. Alcmeon husband of Calirhoe, going to his other wife Alphesthaea, whom he
had deceived, for a jewel, was slain by her brothers.

(1) Polygamie is double Misery. One may as easy serve two maste^s as please
two wives. One at once is enough, if not too much. (2) Achans golden wedge
procured his untimely death. Covetousness endangereth body and soul.

Thy wife to thee no chaster prove then she,
Of whom old Tydaeus might ashamed be.
Diomedes son of Tydaeus, married Aegiale, whom Venus caused to make her body
common, because her husband happened to hurt Venus when she defended Aeneas.

(1) An adulterous wise is Acteons park dispal'd; a whole pound of Hartshorn
infused in Nectar will scarcely cure her husband of the headache. The urine
cast by scolding Zantippe upon the head of her husband Socrates was less
dangerous then an harder thing. A loose wife makes her husband horn-mad and
heart-sad. Faelix quem faciunt aliorum cornua cautum.

Or Locris lass that with her husbands brother
350. Lay; and killed her maid the fact to smother.
Hypermnestra of Locris lay with her husbands brother, and killed her maid, to
make the world think that she, not the mistress was guilty of the offense.

(1) Sin scorns to go alone, Adultery has Murder waiting at her heels: she
that dares destroy her own soul by Adultery, will not stick to destroy another
body by Murder. (2) Committing a second sin to cover the first, is to take a
remedy worse then the disease. Boys will excuse the fault of Treuantnes by the
sin of lying* Adam to quit himself, will lay the fault on God. The woman Thou
gave me, etc.

Gods grant thy life be faithless, and so bad,
As Talaus and Tyndar's son in law had.
1. Amphiaraus husband to Eriphele, daughter of Talaus, one of the seven Kings
that besieged Thebes at first, for fear of the war hid himself, his wife for
jewels discovered him; he went to the siege and there was slain.

(1) An army of valiant Lions led by a cowardly Heart, is not so prevalent as an
army of Hearts led by a Lion. Like Captain, like company. (2) God made husband
and wife one flesh. No man ever yet hated his own flesh, but woman does hers.
The Philistines could not plough without Sampsons Heifer. He was never taken
but by means of a wife. Neither can the Devil tempt us to evil without the
Dalilah of our own flesh. We have good cause then to pray in the sense of the
Spanish proverb, O Lord deliver me from my self.

2. Agamemnon husband of Clytemnestra, daughter of Tyndarus, returning from
Troy, was killed by his own wife and her Adulterer Aegysthus.

(1) My own house should be my castle of defense, not offense. Women, chiefly a
wife, should be not woe to man, but a helper. (2) A sheep shunning a storm,
shelters under a bush, where he loses his fleece, perhaps his life. So the
foolish fish leaped out of the drying pan into the fire. A window wholly opened
brings in less dangerous cold then a small chink. Open enemies abroad overcame
not this royal Agamemnon, but that bitter-sweeting his wife at home.

Or Belus Neeces that did dare to kill
Their Husbands: Therefore carry water still.
Fifty daughters of Danaus son of B^lus, marr^ed to fifty sons of their uncle
Aegyptus, Ovid. Met.
in the first night killed all their new husbands but one, wherefore they are
condemned to draw water in hell, till they fill a sieve or a pitcher full of
holes.

(1) Husband-mens toil is like these wenches, their work is never at an end.
(2) Learn with the one sister Hypermnestro, rather to obey the command of your
Heavenly, then Natural or Civil fathers.

355. With lust of thee thy sister burn, and be
True but in vice, as Biblis, Canace.
1. Biblis daughter of Miletus and Canace, lustfully loved her brother Caunus,
Natal. Comes.
traveling many Countries, and not finding him, she dissolved into a fountain,
the monument of her punishment and perpetual sorrow.

(1) Here we may observe the impotency of passion and wicked affection, Woman
is naturally of a more cold complexion, and tempered with less impudency then
Man, yet that devilish Cupid finds the weaker vessel to be the fittest
instrument to kindle his fiery darts. (2) It is true that Cain and his sons out
of necessity married their own sisters, which was afterward forbidden by the
law of Nature, acknowledged by all Nations. Justin.
But Cambyses persuaded by his sycophants that a King was liable to no law,
durst infringe it. Nay among the Romans Claudius was the first that married his
Niece. Tacitus.


2. Canace daughter of Aeolus, brought forth a child begotten by her own
brother Macareus; her father discovering the child by the crying going to
nurse, killed it with his dogs.

(1) All kinds of sin by the law of Heathens, so by the law of God, were
accounted equal; yet by the laws of Man, Fornication is a great sin, Adultery
greater, Incest greatest of all in that kind. A great folly was committed in
Israel when Judah lay with Thamar his daughter in law, Genesis 38. A greater when
Ammon defiled his sister Tamar, 2 Samuel 13. (2) God will visit the sins of the
fathers upon the children of them that hate him; yet not unless the children
hate him as their fathers did. Why then should unmerciful murdering man punish
a guiltless infant for the guilty parents sin? As Aeolus did the child of his
daughter Canace.

If thou have daughter, may she prove to thee,
As Pelope, Myrrha, and Nyctimene.
1. Pelope daughter of Thyestes lay with her own father; the child by them
begotten, as soon as it was born was cast into the woods to be devoured of
beasts; a shepherd finds it and does nurse it with Goats milk, whence he is
called Aegysthus.

(1) Lot cannot so properly be said to lie with his own daughters as they with
him, for he knew not when they lay down or when they rose up. Neither can his
drunkenness mitigate, but aggravate the sin. When blood touches blood in this
kind, it is abominable out of kind. From such bloud-guiltiness and
bloud-thirstiness good Lord deliver us.

2. Myrrha daughter of Cynaras King of Cipria, by the means of the old witch
her nurse, lay with her own father, being drunk; the child begot was Adonis;
the father discovering his daughter, furiously pursued her; she fled to Arabia,
there fearing to die, and not desirous to live, she is turned into a tree of
her own name.

(1) Bodin observes, that there is an hundred women Witches for one man Witch,
as more easily seduced by the Devil, in regard of their Melancholy and Envy.

Non audet Stygius Pluto tentare, quod audet
Effraenis Monachus, plenaque fraudis anus.
Not Stygian Pluto ever durst pursue,
What a bold Monk or cozening Hag durst do.
(2) Where Bacchus is Porter Venus seldom fails of entrance. Prodigal cups
besot the understanding, drunkenness confounds the Memory, and so bemists the
eye, that things appear not the same as they are.

3. Nyctimene daughter of Nycteus, by the help of her Nurse, enjoyed her
fathers bed; after she living in woods, was turned by Pallas into an Owl.

(1) Ugly was the shape of Nyct^mene being now an Owl, but more ugly her crime
of filthy incest. She is wondered at like a prodigy in nature, driven from the
society of others, ashamed of her self, and stalking in the dark, when virtue
though unfortunate shuns not the light, being a reward and praise to it self.
(2) The Crow and the Owl express two deadly enemies; the Crow breaking the
eggs of the Owl by day: Mr Sandys Met.
and the Owl the eggs of the Crow by night. The Owl is the hieroglyphick of
death, and the Crow of long life. The Owl was sacred to Minerva, and therefore
Homer calls her Glaucopis, either for her gray eyes; for that colored eye has
acutest sight: or from her faculty of watching and musing, the mind in silent
night being more recollected and vigorous; or because the Athenians had many
Owls, or that they stamped their Coin with that figure.

And no more faithful to her fathers hair,
360. Then Pterela's or Nisus daughters were.
1. Clitvetho (whom Servius calls Polidice) knowing all her fathers secrets,
being much taken with the beauty of Amphitrio an enemy; in hope to obtain his
love, cut off her father Pterela King of Thebes his golden hair, which as long
as he kept, Neptune promised he should never be conquered. This hair she gave
Amphitrio, who afterward killed her father, and rejected her.

(1) Dionysius, that would not trust his daughters to cut his hair, but taught
them to singe it off with burning shells of Wall-nuts, was more prudent then
Pterela, or Sampson that discovered to his concubine the lock wherein his
strength did lie. (2) Affection breaks the strongest tie of relation, as we
find in Polidice. Omnia vincit amor. (3) Let not thine enemy know one of thy
secrets, let thy friend know some, let not thy child, no not thy wife know all.
Hezechias disclosing his treasure lost it. Isa. 39.

2. Scylla daughter of Nysus King of Megara, cut off her fathers purple hair,
and gave it Minos then besieging Megara, whose destiny lay in that hair, and so
betrayed her father and city.

(1) Vespasians head without hair did more handsomely become a Crown, then
Absalons hair without a head. (2) Torte^ing is that kingdom whose fate depends
like Damocles sword upon an hair. Unless the supreme head of the Mystical body
do govern the politic, the power of an arm of flesh is not worth an hair. (3)
Happy are true believers, for the very hairs of their head be numbered. Though
we are but as small hairs, no principalities nor power of earth or hell, can
pluck away or separate us from Christ our head.

Or she whose bloody act defamed the place,
That rid in charet over her fathers face.
Tullia daughter of Servius the sixth King of the Romans, wife to Tarquinius
Superbus, to congratulate her husband being new made King, commanded her Coach
to be driven over her dead fathers face, then killed by Tarquin.

(1) Ambition tramples Natural and Civil Fathers under foot, making such
opportunities a stirrup to mount into a throne, swimming through Aceldama to a
Crown. But such puffed bladders when they are swollen to the fullest, one prick
will empty them of all their windy honor.

Perish like those young men whose dismal fate
Was, limbs and head to hang on Pisa 's gate.
Oenomaus King of Pisa, ordained that whosoever conquered him, Not. Com.
by running with horses in a Charet, should marry his daughter Hippodamia, and
that the conquered should die. Thirteen were overcome and put to death, and for
terror were hanged on the gate of Pisa. At last Pelops won the race by the
help of Myrtilus the Coachman, who for a bribe, omitted to put the pin into the
Axle-tree, so the King fell to the ground, and his daughter and the kingdom
fell to Pelops.

(1) Our life is a race, our Antagonists worldly pleasures and carnal
affections, which are like furious horses. (2) Thirteen are conquered, only
one does conquer; Many are called, few chosen, and few there be that shall be
saved; he that conquers shall gain the glory of victory and the crown of
glory. So run therefore that ye may obtain. But the race is not to him that
runs; call for the help of God, he will weaken your adversary, and make you
more then conquerours.

365. Or he that colored with his own that land,
Which with the poor woers blood he first had stained.
That cruel Oenomaus, Natal. Com.
after he had hanged up the heads of so many, at last broke his own neck.

(1) The pitcher that comes too often to the water, in the end is cracked.

-- Neque enim lex justior ulla est,
Quam necis artifices art perire sua.
Nor any juster law find I,
Then death-inventors by their art to die.
So Oenomaus by his own invention was destroyed. (2) Fate can and will effect
its end, without any assistance, against all resistance, yet commonly it
works not alone, Dallington Aph.
but is attended with second and subalterne causes, concurring in the party
himself whose ruin is destined. (3) If a Lions skin will not do it, sew a
Foxes tail unto it. When force prevails not, policy is of force. (4) Divine
justice does often pay the wicked in their own coin, and trap them in their own
snare.

Or the Kings faithless Coachman in that game,
Who to Myrtoan sea did give his name.
Myrtilus the coachman of Oenomaus, demanding of Pelops his promised reward for
betraying his Lord, was thrown into the sea, whence that part of the sea is
called Myrtoum Mare.

(1) Woe unto those that like Myrtilus and Judas, for the wages of iniquity do
betray their own Lord and master. Myrtilus was drowned, Judas burst asunder and
went to his own place, which is thought to be Hell. Let all that aim at such
ends, beware of such an end.

Like those who would the nimble lass in vain,
370. Whose pace three golden apples did retain.
Atalanta daughter of Scheneus, was so swift in running, that he only should
have her, that could outrun her; Ovid Met.
which Hippomenes did, slackning her pace by three golden apples which he cast
one by one in the way, so he won the race and the maid; but Hippomenes proving
unthankful to Venus, was instigated in the temple of Cybele, to his
unseasonable using of his wife, and so were both turned to Lions.

(1) Art, like Atalanta, by her own virtue, if not interrupted, is swifter then
Nature or Hippomenes. Clay long ere it generate a stone, is by fire soon
changed to brick; but all Arts and Sciences are hindered by Lucre, therefore Art
obeys the commands of Nature, as a wife her husband. (2) Here is deciphered
the unconstant mind of a woman, diverted by gold from obedience to the heavenly
Oracle. (3) Ingratitude to Man is an hateful vice, but to God flagitious; it is
seconded with impudence, and impudence is the conductor of uncleanness and
profaneness. (4) As Atalanta, so is Astrea, justice too often stopped in her
course by Gold.

Or those that entered the new Monsters room,
In that blind house whence none could ever come.
Pasiphae in the absence of her husband Minos, King of Crete, fell in love with
a Bull, who enclosed by the art of Daedalus, in a Cow of wood, enjoyed her
infamy, and brought forth a Monster; in his upper parts resembling a Man, in
his nether a Beast: which of her husband and the brutish Adulterer, was called
Minotaure, Herodotus.
whom Minos enclosed in a Labyrinth invented by Daedalus, which was a prison
under the earth, contrived with intricate windings, whence none that were cast
in could ever come out. To this Monster was thrown the ninth year Tribute of
seven youths, and so many virgins to be devoured, in satisfaction of the murder
of Minos his son Androgeus.

(1) Though like prodigious lusts are forbidden by the laws of Moses, as by
ours, which argues a possibility of the prohibited offense, yet it is by the
best and most believed that this Taurus was Minos Secretary, or a Captain of
his army, who with the privacy of Daedalus in his house, dishonored Pasiphae.
(2) By a Labyrinth the Ancient decyphred the perplexed condition of Man,
cumbred and entangled with many and innumerable mischiefs, through which it is
impossible to pass, without the conduct of Wisdom, and exercise of unfainting
fortitude. (3) Pasiphae is the soul married to Minos, (Justice or integrity)
but carried away with sensual delights, is said to commit with a Bull; so
brutish are the affections revolting from virtue, producing monsters of vice.

Or whom Achilles in his grief and ire,
Threw six and six into the solemn fire.
Achilles much grieved for Patroclus, slain by Hector, cast twelve Trojans into
the fire wherein Patroclus was burned.

(1) Why should the loss of a friend make us lose our reason too? Passions are
good servants, bad masters. Let anger have leave to rule but one day, it will
not only with Patroclus kill subjects, but with Semiramis cut off his
Sovereigne; Revenge, Avarice and Ambition, are unreasonable, unsatiable. Let
Christians be merciful, as their heavenly Father is merciful, and leave
vengeance to him that can and will repay it.

375 Or those whom Sphinx with riddles did put down,
And after headlong from a rock were thrown.
Sphinx daughter of Tiphon and Echidna, had the face of a Virgin, wings of a
Bird, and the rest a Lion or Dog: upon a Promontory near Thebes she proposed to
passengers a riddle, which they that could not resolve were cast down the rock:
when Oedipus had resolved it, she brake her own neck. Diodor. Sicul.
But Diodorus does believe that Sphinx was a mere docible Ape. Her Riddle out
of the Greek I English thus. Not. Com. Mythol.


What thing can four-foot, two-foot, three-foot be,
At Morning four, Noon two, at Evening three?
Oedipus his resolve.
A child does creep on four, a man does stand
On two feet, old folk have a staff in hand.
(1) By the fable of Sphinx we are taught to bear all changes and chances with
an undaunted upright mind. Fortune, as Sphinx, has wings, she is unconstant,
claws fit for prey, she can take all away when she will: a face like a woman or
man; for women and men are subject to vicissitudes of fortune, which we ought
to suffer with hearts like Lions. (2) Satan like Sphinx has a face like a
Woman to entice; claws like a Lion to tear us; wings like a bird nimbly to
assault us; and riddles sophistically to deceive us; Let us, like Oedipus, ask
counsel of that true Minerva, Christ, the wisdom of God, to conquer him.

Or who in Bistons Church by sword did die,
Which made the Goddess turn her face awry.
People called Bistones, decreed and vowed to sacrifice all strangers to their
Goddess Pallas; so with others, they used the people of Lemnos, although they
fled to her Temple; which fact did much displease the Goddess.

(1) Offer unto God, not other men's, but thine own; That vow and act of Jephte
Judge. 11. in offering his daughter, was rather an incomparable paroxysme of his
thankful zeal to God, then a warrantable pattern for imitation to us. Much
less should these barbarous Bistons offer strangers in whom they had no
interest. (2) Christ sacrificed his own life for us, being strangers from the
covenant, it is Heathenish then for Christians to make a covenant to sacrifice
strangers or any others life, to their own wrongful wrath.

Or who on crutches weltring in their blood,
380. To horses of the Thracian King were food.
Diomedes King of Thracia, fed his horses with man's flesh, whom Hercules fed
with the flesh of the Tyrant.

(1) This is a punishment agreeable both to the law of God and man, That
offenders should suffer what themselves inflicted. (2) Some think that Diomedes
was one that had wasted his estate, by keeping of horses, therefore Diomedes
friends called his horses Man-eaters. (3) Others conceive that these horses
were his lascivious daughters, who consumed the substance and strength of their
lovers; horses being the Hieroglyphick of lust and foul desires, compared by
holy writ to their neighings; for no creature is so prone to Venus as a Mare;
and is therefore feigned to conceive with the wind. (4) Some do conclude these
horses to be his followers, maintained by exactions, feeding on the bowels, as
it were, of his miserable subjects. But the horses and Master are slain by
Hercules: Covetousness, cruelty and uncleanness corrected and subdued by the
zeal of virtue.

Or who the Lions of Therodomas fed,
Or were to Thoas Goddess offered.
1. Therodomas, a King of Scythia, fearing that his people would rebel, fed
Lions with man's flesh, that so they might become the more fierce to defend his
person, and offend the people, if cause were given.

(1) Wicked rulers do more fear others, then others do fear them. A guard of
simple men is more then enough for a conscientious King, a guard of savage
Lions too little for a conscious Tyrant. Lions by nature are noble creatures,
and sometimes more merciful then their ignoble masters, so those civil beasts
of that cruel King to the patient Prophet, Dan. 5. (2) Except the Lion of the
Tribe of Judah, the King of kings, be his tutelary God, no King can be saved by
a multitude of horses, nor safely guarded by an host of men, and roaring Lions
of hell.

2. Thoas King of Taurica vowed to sacrifice to his Goddess Diana, all
shipwrack'd men and strangers that came into his territories.

(1) Dido was not so extremely courteous to shipwrack'd Aeneas, by recruiting
his wasted livelihood, as Thoas extremely cruel, by taking away shipwrack'd men
and strangers lives, when their livelihood was gone: And which is most
abominable, pretending, forsooth, a sacrifice to his Goddess. Thus persecutors,
as Christ did prophecy, by killing his Ministers, shall think they do God
service, Ioh. 16.2. Simulata sanctitas duplex iniquitas.

Or those with whom Dulichian ships were fraught,
Whom swallowing Scylla and Caribd's caught.
Scylla daughter of Phorchus, was beloved of Glaucus; Circe the famous
inchantress, diverts his affection to her self, and infects the bay frequented
by the Nymph, wherein she bathing, contracts that monstrous deformity, her
loins environed with howling wolves and barking dogs, destroying all that come
near her; as six of Ulysses ships.

(1) Scylla, so a virgin, while chaste, attracts by her beauty the affection of
all, once polluted by the sorceries of Circe rendering her maiden-honour to be
deflowred by bewitching pleasures, she is transformed into an horrid monster,
endeavoring to shipwreck others on the same rocks of vice and misery, (such is
the envy of infamous women.) Scylla was soon after turned into a rock: So is
the impudence of lascivious women hardened by custom. Near the Promontory of
Pelorus, a sharp clift shuts out like a woman, this they call Scylla, full of
holes, the enraged sea here making a noise, are the imagined dogs; on this many
ships too fearfully avoiding the gulf Charibdis, have been split. Sailing
between these two is safe, in the mean between two extremes, Prosperity and
Adversity. Med^o tutissimus ibis. Give me neither poverty nor riches, Lord keep
me below envy and above pity.

385. Or int'his his pa^ch whom Polyphemus sent,
Or to the King of Lestrigonia went.
Of Polyphemus see before.

While Ulysses slept, his companions peeping into the bladder or bag wherein
Aeolus had given Ulysses the winds, lost both the winds and the greater part of
the company, for they were carried to Lestrigonia, where Antiphates a Giant
being their King, ate one of the messengers that were sent for victualing;
Ulysses escaping thence lost eleven ships, and scarcely saved his own. After
twenty years travel, and innumerable crosses he arrived home.

(1) The Sun shines brighter through a vapor dispersed, Dalling. Aph.
and shows the best luster upon an encounter. So virtue. Behold in Ulysses a
wise and good man drawn to life. He was wise, in not making haste to war; he
was wise in joining Achilles strength with h^s policy; he was wise in refusing
the enchanting cups of Circe, etc. but no man ever was under pressures more
then he, yet still supported and relieved by virtue. (2) Providence does
vouchsafe us helps, as the winds to Ulysses, to guide us to our haven; if we
sleep as he, and neglect the means, we shall find our voyage very dangerous.
But through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of heaven.

Or whom in ditch the Carthage Lord did drown,
And made the waters white by stones in thrown.
Amilcar drowned the Councillors of the Acerranii in a ditch, and threw in
stones upon them. Some rather think here is meant Hannibal, Amilcars son, that
made a bridge of dead bodies over the river Gella.

(1) Rather then try what an enemy can do, when thou see what he would do,
make him a bridge of silver to go his way. Rather then stay till they come on
ours, let us pass though over a bridge of dead bodies, and sight him on his own
ground. Turpius ejicitur quam non admittitur hostis. An enemy is easier kept
out then thrust out.

As maids and wooers of Ulysses wife,
390. And who to kill his master lent a knife.
Ulysses when he came to his house he was not known to any: By the help of his
son Telemachus, he slew the lascivious wooers of his Queen, hanged her unchaste
maidservants, and mangled to death Melant^ius his manservant, that lent a
knife to kill his Lord.

(1) Visit not a friend too often, lest thou seem troublesome; not too seldom,
lest thou be forgotten. (2) As Ulysses killed the impetuous Wooers, let us
subdue our affections, that would seduce our souls to vice, that should be as
chaste Penelope. (3) Melanthius, that lent his knife had been as guilty as he
that used it. In murder there is no accessory, the abettor and actor be all
one. The Jews were as guilty as Pilate and the executioner. Just judgment
overtook the Judge, and the blood of their King still lies upon the Jews.

Or the Wrestler that the Aonian guest did kill,
That when he fell ('it is strange) was victor still.
Antaeus a Giant of Lybia 64 Cubits high, begotten of Neptune and the Earth: in
wrestling, Not. Com.
when he was thrown down by Hercules upon the ground, his strength increased,
which Hercules perceiving, lift him from the ground, and squeezing him to his
breast stiffed him.

(1) Hercules, that is, the heat of the Sun, overthrows Antaeus, which
signifies the contrary with his too much heat: according to the Axiom.
Contraries are cured by their contraries. A Fever is not cured by hot things,
nor a Hydropsie by cold and moist. (2) Hercules ^s the symbol of the soul,
Antaeus the body, between Reason the essence of the one, and Pleasure the
essence of the other, is a perpetual conflict. Reason cannot prevail, unless
it so raise the body, that it receive no force from the earth, and that the
desires and affections, which are the sons of the earth, be strangled. The
covetous, the more their affections cling to earthly things, the more strongly
covetous they are. (3) Prosperity by lifting up, chokes; adversity by casting
down, does strengthen.

Or whom Antaeus arms pressed out of breath,
Or L^mnian wives did put to cruel death.
1. Antaeus compelled foreigners to wrestle with him, and so strangled them
with his matchless strength.

(1) Thus the mighty oppress the weak, as the greater fish devour the less: The
brass pot with one touch will crack the earthen; let the brittler then keep
off, with a Noli me tangere. If the Frog swells at the Ox he will burst, so a
Peasant meddling with a Potentate.

2. The women of Lemnos for despising the sacrifice of Venus, were by the
Goddess made so loathsome, that their husbands left them, and lived with new
wives abroad; at last coming home, the old slew the new wives and their
husbands, with all the male-children, save one.

(1) If no relation, no Religion, no other motive can persuade, methinks women
should serve and love God, that the God of love may not permit their husbands
instead of love to loathe them.

395. Or he that by inhumane sacrifice
Got rain, but suffered by his own device.
Thraseas or Thraseus a soothsayer, in a great drought, told Busiris the Tyrant
of Egypt, that rain would fall if he sacrificed strangers to Jupiter. Busiris
finding him to be a stranger, replied, Then thou shall first bring Egypt rain,
and so offered him first.

(1) Drought in Egypt is rare, Herodotus.
for the river Nilus does overflow it. (2) 'H (...). Evil counsel proves worst
to the counselor, as to Thraseus and Achitophel. (3). Let us, wanting rain,
fall to the earth as Elias, and ascend to heaven with prayer; let us with David
water our couch with tears for our sins, which make the heavens like brass.

Or like Antaeus brother that did stain
Altars with blood, whereon himself was slain.
Some take the brother of Antaeus to be Pigmalion, but I think more properly,
it was Busiris (for he and Autaeus were sons of Neptune.) As he sacrificed men
to Jupiter, so did Hercules him.

(1) Were that primordial Law of Nature well ponde^ed, applied and practiced
[Do as thou would be done to] who would steal? who would murder? Now because
men will not do to others as they would have others do to them, they suffer by
others as others did by them. (2) Busiris is held to be the King of Egypt,
Sandys Met.
that so heavily oppessed the Israelites, the author of that inhumane Edict of
drowning their male-children; hence he is said to have sacrificed strangers:
his daughter is supposed to be the same that fostered Moses. Reinesius proves
that he was a King of a new family, who usurped that crown, intimated by that
text in Exodus. There arose a new King in Egypt that knew not Joseph.

Or who his cruel horses, did instead
400. Of grass and hay, with humane bodies feed.
Of Diomedes you may read before.

Like two by one revenger singly killed,
Diximanus son in law and Nessus stilled.
1. Diximanus of Olenum, was forced by Euricion to promise him his daughter
Mnesimache, and to make him his son in law; on the appointed day of marriage,
Hercules requested by Diximanus, came and cut off his head.

(1) Ingens telum necessitas. Fear makes a man promise what he is not only
unable, but unwilling to perform. (2) By one pin drive out another, force by
force, plot by plot. (3) Involuntary love is like a Mushroome that has no
root, the least puff will blow it down. (4) Hercules better deserved a Deity
then all the rest of the Heroes, he conquered nothing for himself, but ranged
all over the world, not to oppress it, but to free it from oppressors, and by
killing of Tyrants, and monsters, preserved it in tranquillity. He got immortal
glory by Juno's mortal envy; before called Alcides, strong, he gained the name
Hercules, compounded of Juno and honor.

2. Nessus a Centaure, promised to carry Deianira the wife of Hercules, over
the river Evenus, while himself did swim: the perfidious Centaure (he being
landed) attempts to ravish her, but is prevented by a mortal wound from his
arrow.

(1) It is not safe trusting a stranger with my goods, much less with a good
wife. The counsel is general, Fide, sed cui, vide. Try before you trust. For in
this monstrous age, too many Centaures of two several natures do survive, that
pretend one courtesy to their neighbor, and thereby intend two unto
themselves: as these double creatures inherit Nessus his condition, I wish they
were inhabiting in his country. Mel in ore, verba lactis, fell in cord, fraus
in factis. Words of milk, honey in mouth, gall in heart, no deeds of truth. (2)
The arrows of vengeance will overtake the adulterer as Nessus. (3) Fear
judgment and thou will forbear sin.

Like Saturnes Nephew whom Coronis son,
Saw yielding up the ghost from his own town.
Aesculapius son of Coronis and Apollo, from Epidaurus, a town which he had
built, saw that famous thief Periphaltes, or Periphetes, who was son of Vulcan,
the son of Saturn, killed by Theseus, and his club taken from him, as the Lions
skin by Hercules, whose example in most things Theseus followed. And now our
Poet having past over the most remarkable acts of Hercules, begins with those
of Theseus.

(1) Heathen Gods are feigned to have leaden feet and iron hands, in that
divine vengeance, though slow, is sure and sore, and pays offenders home in
their own coin. Those that killed with the club, have perished by the club. So
it was foretold by the Lord of the Prophets* He that takes the sword, shall
perish by the sword. These knockers and cutters, my ever honored friend, that
reverend Divine, Dr Hoskins, in his Lecture upon the eighth Commandment, does
call St Nicholas Clerks. I know that some of those Clerks have been well
content with so much of the Latin tongue, as Legit ut Clericus: others have
aspired so high as the Greek Alphabet, and when they came to II, they made an
end. (2) From Jericho to our heavenly Jerusalem, we often fall among thieves;
Lord give us complete armor of the Spirit to conquer them.

405. As Sinis, Sciron, Poliphemon and
His son, with him that was half bull half man.
Plutarch in Theseus.
1. Sinis, which is by Plutarch called also Pityocamtes, that is, a wreather of
Pine-trees, tied men to branches of trees bended down, so the cords or withes
being cut, the strangers being jerked up were killed. So Theseus used him; for
both Theseus and Hercules made Tyrants undergo their own cruelties.

(1) The Eagle in the Fable, mounted the Tortoise aloft, on purpose to break
it. Many Kings have advanced ambitious subjects, not in love but envy, not to
prefer and raise them, but to precipitate and ruin them: the higher they
climb, the lower they fall.

2. Theseus threw Scyron down a clift, who in cruel pastime caused those whom
he robbed to wash his feet and kiss his toe, and while they were about it
spurned them into the sea.

(1) Many Kings have kissed the Popes toe, yet he has kicked the Crowns off
their heads. (2) Too low submission unto a lofty Tyrant does heighten his
insolence, and hastens the peoples downfall. Asperius nihil est humili cum
surgit in altum.

3. Theseus put Polipemon and his son Damastres or Procrustes to the same
death, which they had inflicted on others, who rackt out or cut short to the
length of their bed, such strangers as came to Harmonia.

(1) Thus Levellers, by Apocope, would pare off the superfluities of long
Estates; and by Paragoge, add to the extremities of the short, so make both
even to their own ends. Thus in some parts the Tax of strongest and longest
means is shortened, and the lowest and weakest lengthened. But,

Deuce Ace non possunt, and Sice Sink solvere nolunt.
Omnibus est notum Cater Tray solvere totum.
Deuce Ace cannot pay scot and lot, and Sice Sink will not pay:
Be it known to all, what payments fall must light on Cater Tray.
4. The Minotaure in the Labyrinth, who was half Bull half man, wat slain by
Theseus. Read of this before.

(1) The Romans bear a Minotaure in their Ensigns, to declare that the Counsels
and Stratagems of a General should be muffled in the unsearchable blackness of
secrecy (like a Labyrinth) not to be traced by the enemy, yea often to be
concealed from dearest friends, according to the saying of Metellus, If I
thought my shirt knew my purpose, I would tear it off my back. (2) Sensual and
worldly people are like the Minotaure, like Men in Soul, like Beasts in Body.
If sin kills the first, the other suffers alike. (3) The greatest Bulls of
Basan, the stoutest Potentates, were they as strong as Minotaures, will be
overtaken by death, violent or natural: No place so intricate, or so strongly
fenced a Labyrinth, can secure the highest person. Nullo fata loco possis
excludere.

As he that men from boughs to the air up threw,
And billows did of this and that sea view.
Pityocamptes dwelt between the Io^nian and Aegean sea, he is the same with
Sinis, of whom I spoke before.

Or like to savage Cercyons corpse whose slaughter
410. By Theseus hand moved Ceres unto laughter.
Cercyon, as some report, was a notable strong th^ef; near Eleusis, he bowed
the stoutest trees, and binding men unto them, tote them in pieces. But
Plutarch relates that Theseus killed him as he others, Plutarch in Theseus.
by murdering those whom he conquered; he first devised the sleights of
wrestling, which was carried only by strength before: Ceres laughed to see him
die, because he spoiled her country Eleusis.

(1) His own iniquity shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with
the cords of his own sin, Prove. 11.10. Adoni-besech was punished himself as he
had punished others, Judge. 2. (2) As there is joy in heaven for Gods mercy upon
a repenting sinner: so may in some sort be on earth, for his judgment upon
impenitent reprobates, as they are enemies to the commonwealth of Israel. (3)
The surviving Horatius in Florus, killed his own sister, Florus l. 1.
because she wept on the slain body of an enemy to the Romans.

All plagues implored by my just wrath on thee
Befall, let none thou suffer lighter be.
As Achimenides in Sicily
Was left, the Trojan Navy being nigh.
Achimenedes son of Adamantus, one of Ulysses soldiers, was left in Polyphemus
den, till Aeneas, three months after relieved him.

(1) When a jade is tired, and overworn, give one his skin, to knock him in the
head. When a silkworm has done his work let him fly or die: when the war is
off, and the Generals design and aim attained, let the soldier after sink or
swim: the Amalekite howsoever was too blame, that left his servant (or
soldier) sick in the field, 2 Samuel 30.23. much more is he that leaves him in a
dungeon.

415. Be thou as double-named Irus poor;
Of beggars on the bridge make thou one more.
Irus was first named Arnaeus, afterward Irus, from Iris; for as Iris the
Rainbow is the messenger or servant to Juno, that is, the Air, so was Irus to
the Woers of Penelope; he had a singular art in begging, and hence came the
Adage, Iro pauperior, Poorer then Irus: Ulysses with his fist cuffed him and
killed him. Beggars commonly sit on a bridge, where most passengers do resort.

(1) Poverty is to any ingenious spirit the extremest misery. (2) A serving-man
young, a beggar old, chiefly if his master be luxurious or lascivious; for when
he has consumed his revenue, himself and his retinue must beg or steal. When
the prodigal feeds upon husks, what reversion falls to his needy greedy
servants share? (3) Roman masters in their manumission by a cuff on the ear,
put their slaves free into the world; but Ulysses freely cuffed Irus out of the
world.

Pray still to Ceres son, but still in vain.
Call still upon him, yet no riches gain.
Plutus son of Ceres, is feigned to be the God of riches, and to lie in the
subtreranean parts of Spain, which coast abounds with Minerals; but many
Authors conclude, that Plutus is the same with Pluto, the God of hell, son in
law to Ceres.

(1) In the division of the world between the three sons of Saturn, the
heavens were allotted to Jupiter, the seas to Neptune, and hell to Pluto; that
is, Jupiter reigned in the Orient, called the superior part, whence light
ascends, Sandys.
as the occident the inferior, assigned to Pluto. This tradition is derived
from the partition of the earth between the three sons of Noah, Sem, Ham and
Japhet; And because the Western Climats, where Pluto reigned, abounded with
gold and silver, wrapped in the secret bowels of the earth, he was called the
infernal Deity, or the God of riches, as his name imports: Nor unaptly were
riches feigned to proceed from hell, which have carried such a number thither:
This God is painted lame, and winged, for wealth comes halting to the honest,
but gallops on Pluto's black horses unto others.

Because the waters ebb and flow, the sand
Is slippy; on it no foot can steadfast stand:
So let thy mean estate still melt away,
And slip between thy fingers day by day,
As he whose girl a thousands shapes did try,
So be thou full, and yet with famine die.
Erisichthon, a Thessalian, despising the Gods, cut down a grove dedicated to
Ceres, and was therefore punished with unsatiable hunger, so eating his own
flesh, notwithstanding Metra his daughter, that could change her self into
diverse shapes, was contented often to be sold, to gain whereby to feed her
father.

(1) Groves were consecrated to some Deity or other, because such shady and
delightful places affected the mind, and reduced it to sequestered
contemplations, composing the thoughts, and inspiring a secret propensity to
devotion, begetting an apprehension of some latent or hidden power. But what
being well applied might nourish devotion, was converted by abuse unto
Idolatry. The Jews were often guilty of this superstition. (2) Erisichthon
perhaps was a prodigal glutton, who by wast expenses, was reduced to such
extreme beggary, that he was glad to prostitute his own daughter for his
sustenance, who had Oxen, Sheep and other provisions given her by her lovers:
Therefore Metra was scoffingly said to be changed into many shapes; for the
Ancients cattle was their Money ( Pecunia from Pecus) Judah sent such a reward
to Thamar; Misery is the companion of impiety. (3) Perhaps Erisichthon had a
wolf in his breast, or had a dog-like appetite, ever hungry, never thriving; of
which disease, Eusebius reports the Murderers of the Innocents died.

425. Let man's flesh prove delicious unto thee,
So of our time a Tydeus thou shall be.
Tydeus son of Oeneus King of Calidonia, when he was mortally wounded by
Menalippus, desired and had brought unto him, the head of his enemy, which he
gnawed like a dog, and so died.

(1) The biting of a dying serpent is deep. (2) That man's hate is almost
immortal, that is not satisfied with the head of his mortal foe. Heroic Caesar
wept over Pompey dead, whom he could not endure alive. A Coward, like Dametas,
will fearfully abuse that person dead, whose face without trembling fear he
durst not look upon alive.

Act that which may the Horses of the Sun
Affright, and make to the East from West to run.
Thyestes adulterously used the wife of his brother Atreus: he in revenge,
killed the children of Thyestes, and made of them a feast for their father: at
sight of which horrid fact, the Sun is storied to run back.

(1) Jealousy and abuse of the marriage bed, burns like fire, and is seldom
quenched without some blood. Pelopis domus ruat vel in me, dummodo in fratrem
ruat, Senec. Thyest.
says Atreus. Let Pelops house fall on me too, so it falls upon Thyestes.
Revenge is delicious, malicious, ingenious, and ambitious. Thyestes was wicked
in wronging Atreus wife; Atreus was more wicked, in slaying Thyestes innocent
children. We blame the heathen for killing other men's children, and we more
cruelly kill our own, either in giving them that we should not, by Indulgence,
or not giving them that we should, by Education. Yea, some devour them alive,
if not in persons, yet in their portions, by luxury and lust. Virgil. 2 Aen.
(2) Atreus (as Servius notes) was the first that found out the Eclipse of the
Sun, therefore the Sun is said to hide his face. (3) When the Son of God
suffered, the Sun of the Sky did hide his face. The Sun of righteousness is of
purer eyes then to behold iniquity.

Do thou revive Lycaons bloody feast,
430. And seek by guile to cozen Jove thy guest.
Lycaon the Arcadian King with roast and sod limbs of a Molossian, entertained
Jupiter walking on the earth in the shape of a man, on purpose to kill him; the
God burned his house, and turned him into a Wolf.

(1) Pontanus thinks this to be derived from the eighth chapter of Genesis.
Thus many Poetical fables (says Tertullian) had their original from the
Scriptures. (2) Lycaon an inhumane Prince feasted the Cretan Jupiter (then with
him on an embasie) with the flesh of a stranger, which discovered he overthrew
the table, and raised the citizens, who by Joves conduct drove him out into the
woods, where living like an outlaw, he committed many robberies; hence arose
this fable. Men infected with the Melancholy disease or rather madness, called
Lycanthropia, think themselves Wolves and lurk in woods. This fable deterreth
us from impiety, treachery and inhospitality; and exciteth us to the contrary
virtues, seeing the Gods, though disguised, are always present, punishing and
rewarding according to our actions. In all affections our Poet proportioneth
the transformation, according to the quality of the transformed; as this of
Lycaon.

Let one tempt God and make a meal of thee,
Thou Tantalus and Tereus boy shall be.
Tantalus cut his son in pieces, and set it before the Gods in a feast, either
to see if they could discern it, or for the greater magnificence, in
sacrificing unto them that which was most in estimation: None was eaten but the
shoulder, by Ceres. The Gods pitying Pelops, supplied the want with Ivory, and
revoked his soul to the body.

(1) This sacrificing of children is thought to be derived from the immolation
of Isaac; A wretched custom, not only among the Heathens but Jews, who
offered their sons and daughters unto Moloch. Tantalus offering his son to the
Gods, allegorically declares that nothing should be so near and dear to us
which we would not sacrifice to God and Religion, who restores what we give
with greater perfection. For Tantalus being rich, despised all wealth and
pleasure, to attend the Gods service, and thence is said to starve in plenty.
For the History: It is conjectured, that Pelops was inhumanely handled by his
father, therefore feigned to be cut in pieces and served to the Gods, who
recompensed his sufferings with future plenty, reputation and power; for Ivory
signifies riches, and shoulder strength. (2) Though Ceres, that is, the Earth
shall consume our flesh, it shall be restored stronger, our bodies sown in
weakness shall be raised in power.

2. Tereus son of Mars, ravished Philomela, sister of his own wife Progne, and
fearing discovery, cut out her tongue. Progne being certified of it by lines
written in the blood of Philomela, killed her son Itis, gotten by Tereus, and
boiled him, for her husbands supper; which being discovered, he drew a sword to
kill her, but she was turned into a Swallow, and escaped; he into a Lapwing,
and Philomela into a Nightingall.

(1) Lustful Kings resemble Lapwings, they have Crowns, as these have tuffs on
their heads, they take delight in sensual pleasure, as these birds in filthy
dung. (2) By Progne and Philomela may be meant Oratory and Poetry. Oratory
delights in Towns as the Swallow in houses; Poetry as the Nightingall in woods.
Ovid. Trist.
Carmina secessum scribentis and otia quaerunt. And as far as the Nightingal
exceeds the Swallow, so does the Poet excel the Orator: for the Poet adds
delight unto persuasion. (3) Learning by sons of Mars, as Tereus, is made
tengue tied. Scholars like the Nightingall, have a prick at their heart; if
they sing, the burden must be Lachrymae or Lamentation.

So let thy limbs be scattered in the way,
As his that did his fathers pursuit stay.
Medea flying after Jason, takes her young brother Absyrtus with her, to
retard the violence of her pursuing father, she kills the child, and straweth
his mangled limbs in the fathers way.

(1) The Devil is not so black as he is painted, nor Medea so bad as she is
feigned. Medea signifies Counsel, daughter of Iduia, that is, Knowledge; she
follows Jason, that is, a Physician; this declares, that he is no Physician,
but a Fool, that wants counsel and understanding: She was begotten of the
Sun, for all Counsel and Understanding comes from Heaven. (2) Let us kill out
inordinate affections, our bosome-sins, though so near and dear as a brother,
to follow Christ the Physician of our souls. If thine eye offend thee pluck it
out.

435. Let that of old Perillus be thy fate,
Bulls voice in brazen bull to imitate,
Perillus in hope of a reward, taught Phalaris King of Agrigentum to fry men to
death in an Engine of Brass made like a Bull, which Perillus first seasoned
with his own death.

(1) The Water is commonly even, till he undermining wind does force it into
surging billows: A small sparkle of severity in a Prince has not seldom been
kindled into unexpected flames of Tyranny, by the ominous breath of ambitious
and covetous spirits; but the sparks have often retorted into the faces of
those incendiary Boanerges. Self-end Timists have brought upon themselves
untimely ends. When Achitophel saw that his counsel turned to foolishness, he
foolishly saved the Hangman a labor.

As cruel Phalaris let thy tongue be cut,
Then Bull-like rore in brass of Paphos shut.
Phalaris long practiced the torture that Perillus taught, and at last suffered
the same death in his own Bull.

(1) A free horse being pricked runs on till he break his own neck. Ill
counsel, like the Basilisk, kills the object with its pestiferous influence. (2)
Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare. Princes that have acted what they
would, have suffered what they would not. The wicked fall themselves into the
same pit which they dug for others. Hamon shall be hanged on the same
gallows he made for Mordecai.

Or like Admetus father-law that would,
440. Return to youthful years when he was old.
Pelias (whose daughter Alceste was married to Admetus) in hope by the
medicines of Medea, to renew his old age, was cut in pieces, and sod in a
Caldron, mean time Medea upon her winged serpents fled in the air away.

(1) Medea was the first that invented Physical baths, whereby she cured many
diseases, especially Consumptions, and restored men to their former alacrity;
and because her Composition was called a decoction, she was feigned to effect
her cures by boiling of her Patients. But Peleas being old and weak, is said to
have died in the bath, through extreme imbecility. That is the ground of that
fable. (2) Thus many are seduced by vain hopes to attempt things impossible,
with fruitless labor and irrepairable loss So those that by the cuning of
impostors, are seduced to study that foolish art of Alchymy, hoping to turn all
metals into gold and silver, turn themselves out of all. (3) We all desire old
age, but when we have it, we are weary of it. Ubi ad metam perveneris, ne velis
reverti. When thou art come to thy journeys end, it is madness to return on
purpose to begin again. I have been young and now am old, and would not be
young again; for I have suffered already enough of misery, and acted too much
sin.

Leap into the earth alive, like that stout Roman,
But let thy act be Chronicled by no man.
Marcus Curtius when he heard that a great cleft in the midst of Rome,
presaging the ruin of all, could not be shut, unless some noble man leaped
into it, he armed on horsback rid into it, so presently the gap was closed, and
the city saved from sinking: hence that place was called Curtius lake.

(1) Why should Christians tremble at death, by which they hope to gain a
better life, when a Pagan meets and embraces death, whereby he thought his
life and all future hopes were lost? (2) A good man is a common good: The
heathen accounted it the greatest honor to sink, that so their Country might
swim in honor. What then is that Christian who cares not if his country sink
so that himself may swim in wealth and pleasure? (3) Christ willingly submitted
his ^ody to death and the grave, that Christians souls might not be swallowed
up in hell.

Perish like those that in the Grecian land,
Sprung up of teeth sown by Sydonian hand.
Cadmus that ruled in Sydon, sent by his father Agenor, to seek his lost
daughter Europa, killed a Serpent, whose teeth being sowed in the earth
produced armed soldiers, which presently killed each other. Cadmus himself was
turned into a Serpent, and at last sent by Jupiter to the Elysian fields.

(1) Agenor by interpretation is a valiant man, Cadmus his son does confirm it.
Europa is immortal glory, carried away by Jupiter, whom to find is a labor of
excessive difficulty, therefore Cadmus consulteth with Apollo: for divine
advice is the best Philosophy, and only guide to noble endeavors: By thi^ we
shall be enabled to kill the serpent of hell, and those snakes in our own
bosoms, Intemperance and all evil desires. (2) This history or fable, gives me
hint of civil war; but I dare not touch that string (Infandum renovare dolorem)
lest I drop more tears then ink: But to our comfort Christ was the true Cadmus,
who was sent by his father to seek that which was lost, he was the destroyer of
the great Dragon, the Devil and all his armed teeth, his associats the
Heretics and Sch^smaticks.

445. As Pentheus Nephew and Medusa 's brother,
For cross misfortunes, be thou such another.
Menaecius a Theban, son of Creon, who was grandchild to Pentheus, when he
heard that the Oracle answered, If the last of the posterity of Cadmus were
sacrificed to Mars, the city Thebes then besieged by the Argives should be
saved, thinking the matter concerned him, with his own sword killed himself. As
for Medusa's brother, I return ignoramus, for Medusa one of the Gorgons had no
brother; perhaps Ovid means Archilochus: of whose death read before.

(1) Pro patria sit dulce mori licet atque decorum; Vivere pro patria dulcius
esse puto.

Though for my country sweet it is to die:
To live for it it is sweeter far say I.
I cannot much condemn him, that living by the dim candle of Nature did
sacrifice himself to Mars, by sword, to the honor of his God, himself, and his
country; as him that under the clear sunshine of the Gospel, does sacrifice
himself unto Bacchus by riot, to the dishonor of God, himself, and his
country. Plures n^cat gula quam gladius.

Such as the bird was doomed to that did chatter
Small secrets, and does wash her plumes in water.
Coronis informs of the infidelity of Aglauros, Pandrosus, and concerning
Erichthonius given them to keep in secret: she is therefore banished the
service of Minerva, and of a white Nymph turned to a black Crow.

(1) The Crow is the symbol of Garrulity, and therefore rejected by Minerva;
because much talking interrupts the meditation of the mind, and is offensive to
wisdom. And no Crow comes near Athens, (called so from Athena, the Greek name
of Minerva) of which city Minerva was Patroness; That perhaps may be the ground
of this fable. (2) Silence is secure, when speaking truth is often obnoxious
unto danger. We have given us by nature two Eyes, two Ears, and but one tongue
to inform us, that we should hear and see twice so much as speak. The Eyes and
Ears are Receivers, the Mind the Treasurer, B. Hall Med.
and the Tongue the Steward; if the Steward disburseth more then, or as much as
is brought in, there will be but a poor treasury: Therefore let thy mouth be
shut with fidelity, nor to blab secrets, and let thine ear not be too open to
receive them. (3) One justly wished, that Tale-bearers should be hanged by the
Tongue, Tale-hearers by the Ears.

So many wounds may thou endure as he,
450. At whose great sacrifice no knife must be.
Osiris was cut in pieces by his brother Typhon, therefore his Priests in
remembrance of that, do use no knife at their sacrifice. After his death, they
thought an Ox which they met, had been the soul of Osyris, this therefore the
Egyptians did worship for a God, calling him Serapis, that is, an Ox head, and
Apis, that is, an Ox face.

(1) That is the very name whereby the Fathers used to express Idolatry,
derived from the Egyptians to the Israelites, first set up in the wilderness,
and after at Dan and Bethel by Jeroboam; Some say the first institution was in
memory of Joseph: for what fitter Emblem to continue the remembrance of Joseph
(had it not proved an Idol) then an Ox, the lively Hieroglyphick of an
industrious husbandman, by whose care the Egyptians in the famine were
(preserved. (2) Diodorus Siculus thinks that the Egyptians worshipped an Ox for
the Sun, that is strong like a Giant to run his course. Typhon, that is, the
Earth, does seem to kill the Sun, by cutting off his light three hundred sixty
six times in the year. (3) As those Priests did in their sacrifice, commemorate
their slain Osiris; So (with reverence be it sp^^^^) we celebrate the Sacrament
of the supper, in remembrance of the Lamb slain before the foundation of the
world.

As those, whom mother Cybele forced to dance
To Phrygian notes, thy privy-members lance.
The great mother was called Rhoa, from (...), to flow; because the Earth
thereby signified, does flow and abound with all good things: and Ops, because
it affords all kind of wealth: and Vesta, because it is clothed with all
sorts of fruits and flowers; and Cybele from Cymballs or from Cybelus, a hill
in Phrygia. Her Priests were called Galli, or Corybantes. At their sacrifice
they daunced with drums and timbrels, being possessed with madness; they gelt
themselves and ran about, shaking their bodies and their heads.

(1) The Earth is the mother of all, why then should Grandees boast of their
Pedigree? The King and the beggar came out of the same Earth, and the one shall
enjoy no more of the Earth then the other, when they are dead.

(2) The same Cybele, which was mother of the Gods, was mother also of the
Giants: the same earth produces food and poison, the same Church affords
sons of God and children of Satan. (3) These new Quakers do much resemble those
old Priests for their madness, shaking, and many other giddy qualities, but
('it is pity) they want castration.

Of man, as Atys be nor man nor mad,
Harsh tymbrels by thy lustful hand be played.
Atys, a beautiful boy, was beloved of Cybele, and made chief of all her
Priests, upon condition that he should live chaste; but he defloured a Nymph
called Samgarit, therefore the Goddess struck him with madness, wherein he gelt
himself, and by his example, all her Priests after were gelt: But many authors
do report, that Atys, not willing to yield to Cybeles lustful fuits, to
preserve his much tempted chastity, gelt himself.

(1) Atys is said to be turned into a Pinetree, by reason of that trees
infertility, therefore said to be gelt; beloved of Cybele, because the Pine is
consecrated to that Goddess. (2) It is less damage, far less disgrace, to lose
my coat with honest Joseph, yea my privy members with Atys, then to lose my
soul by making my body, which is the member of Christ, the member of an Harlot.
The Beaver perceiving that the hunter pursues him for his testicles, cuts them
off, and so does save his life.

455. Of that great mothers beast assume the face,
As she that lost, and he that won the race.
Cybele the mother of the Gods, was drawn in a charet by Lions, into which kind
of creatures she turned Hippomenes and Atalanta, for their unreasonable lust in
her Temple.

(1) See here the dignity of the Earth, meant by Cybele, the mother of All, she
is drawn by Lions, the most noble of all creatures. Those children therefore be
worse then beasts that do not submit themselves to their parents, when Lions
bow their necks to their common Mother the Earth. (2) In regard of the savage
fury of lust, Hippomenes and Atalanta are said to be turned into furious Lions.

And left Limone thus should die alone,
Let Horses gnaw thy flesh unto the bone.
Of Limone read before.

Or as Cassandra's King, thou worse then he,
460. With clods of eath may thou over whelmed be.
Cassandrus King of Cassandra, for his cruelty and his covetousness, was by his
subjects quelled with Earth.

(1) It is no paradox to be rich with a little, and to be poor with much;
because content is the poor man's riches, and desire the rich man's poverty, for
it is never satisfied. That head of Cyrus that so much thirsted after blood, at
the last was drowned in a barrel of blood by Tomyris. covetous earthly
Muckwormes have never enough till their mouths are full of earth.

As Abas Heir, as Lyrness King be slain,
And headlong cast into the restless main.
Acrisius the Argive King, being told by Oracle, that he should be slain by the
son of his daughter Danae, enclosed her to prevent his destiny, together with
her Nurse, in a tower of brass, where Jupiter descending in a golden shower,
was received into her embracements. Perseus, the child of them begotten, was
shut up by Acrisius with his mother in an Art, and exposed to the fortune of
the Sea: Ovid wishes Ibis not only to be cast into the sea, as Perseus, who
was saved, and became after King of Lerna, but to be killed and drowned.

(1) Jupiter, says Lactantius, endeavoring to violate Danae with store of
gold, corrupted her chastity. Gold conquers Virginity, Towers, Castles, easier
than the Sword. Let a golden Ass come to Athens he may reverently proceed Quid
non? Perseus is feigned to be born of Jupiter, for his noble achievements and
felicity; he had the wings of Mercury, which signify celerity, tied to his
feet and not to his shoulders, to declare, that in warlike affairs men should
deliberate in the beginning, but be swift in the prosecution: He had Mars his
Fauchion, which expresses policy and circumvention; Pluto's Headpiece a
concealment of Councels, and Pallas Shield a provident Preservation; being all
the necessary accomplishments of a Soldier. (2) No place can secure us from
temptations and sin: Angels fell in Heaven, Adam in Paradise, as Danae in the
tower of brass. Therefore I say unto all, Watch.

At Phoebus altar sacrifice thy breath,
Conquered Theodotus suffered such a death.
Theodotus presuming to be called King of Bactrians, was overcome by Arsaces
King of Persia, and after sacrificed by him to Apollo the God of Learning.

(1) Were all the enemies to Apollo and Learning sacrified upon altars, revived
Muses would again ascend their own Parnassus, pluck down their harps from the
mournful willows, and be re-adorned with their wonted joyful bays. Knowledge
has no worse enemy then impudent ignorance. Ahab was punished for sparing
Benhadad the enemy of God. Amici (much more inimici) vitia fi feras facis tua.
Connivance at sin is compliance with sin.

465. Thee let Abdera one day vote to dye,
Let stones upon thy head like hailstones fly.
People of Abdera a town in Thracia, the native place of Democritus the
Philosopher, and Protagoras, at the beginning of each year were wont to vote
one man for the Commonwealth to dye, and he was stoned.

(1) The ancient Jews, at the Feast of Expiation used to offer two Goats,
Godwins Moses and Aaron.
whereof one was sacrificed; on the head of the other, called the Scapegoat,
the Priest disburdened the sins of the whole congregation, and let him escape
into the wilderness. By the escape Goat is shadowed the impassibility of Ch^ists
divine nature, by the other his sufferings in his manhood. The modern Jews upon
the same day, the Men take a white Cock, and the Women a Hen, and thrice
swinging it about the Priests head, do thus speak: This Cock shall be a
propitiation for me. And why a Cock? because (say they) Gibher has sinned,
therefore Gibher shall make satisfaction; Now Gibher in Hebrew signifies a man,
in their Talmud a Cock: Hence I conceive came that common saying, oftener read
then understood. Albo Gallo ne manum admoliaris, Lay not thy hand upon a white
Cock, that is, Rob not God of his offering. The Grecians at the yearly
expiation of their Cities, tumbled down condemned persons into the sea, saying,
(...). Be thou a propitiation for us. So in a great infection, they sacrificed
men, and called them (...). The Apostle uses both these words, 1 Cor. 4.13. We
are (...). Filth and offscouring. We are as odious, and laden with cursing and
reviling, as those persons who were offered up by way of public expiation.
Christ was made a sin for us sinners, and freely offered himself for us, the
just for the unjust.

Or l^ke Hippomenes son, Jove in his ire
With bolts thee kill, or like Dosithoes sire.
1. Prester, son of Hippomenes, railed at Jupiter, for that he had justly
thrown his father out of his kingdom for his cruelty, and was therefore killed
with a thunderbolt; but Vegetius reports this of Capaneus, son of Hipponous.

(1) To make and not execute laws, is to make a private man's offense the sin of
the public: For to omit the punishment of it, Dal. Aph.
is to commit it. (2) To take offense at the just punishment of the offender,
is to disapprove justice, and approve the offense. Such a reviler should be
whipped into good manners and obedience, for example; lest he breaks forth into
like enormities, and draw more after him: Caesar when his Nobles could not come
to his royal Feast for tempests, commanded his Archers to shoot up arrows at
Jupiter in heaven, but they turned back on their own heads. No sin of Israel
was so grievous to to God as Murmuring. Repine not when God does punish the
sins of thy friend, lest he dip his arrows in thy blood too.

2. Atrax was slain by a thunderbolt for destroying his own daughter
Dofithoae, because she ^ay with Jupiter.

(1) In the hands of a Parent is the power of correction, not destruction of
their children. Parents should pray that God would give their sinful children
grace, and time to repent, not ungraciously to cut off their time of repentance
by untimely death. The Magistrate bears the sword in vain, if a private
person may execute public justice. (2) Divine vengeance will not leave cruelty
unrevenged: Therefore if thy brother offend, forgive him seventy times seven
times, considering that if God should call thee to an account, thou can not
answer one of a thousand.

Si quoties homines peccant, sua fulmina mittat
Jupiter, etc. --
When the child falls into a gross offense, put thy hand into thy own bosom
and ask, What have I done?

Autonoes sister Maia's sisters son,
470. Or that unskilful Coachman Phaeton.
1. Semele sister of Autonoe, daughter of Cadmus, having too often enjoyed the
company of Jupiter, at last denied him any further approach, unless he came to
her as to Juno, with the ensigns of his deity, he embracing her with lightning
and thunder, killed her.

(1) Those who too curiously and boldly search into Divine Majesty, shall be
oppressed with the brightness of his glory. (2) Jupiter and Juno are said to
couple with thunder and lightning, because lightning and thunder proceed from
the conjunction of the etherial heat and acrial cold. Jupiter had a
three-forked thunderbolt, so there be three sorts of lightning, the drier
dissipates, the moister blasts, the other melts money in bags, and swords in
scabbards, instantly lifting up liquor in vessels, without breach or impair to
the thing contained, slaying Infants in the womb without mortal prejudice to
the mother. By the variety of lightning, learn that God does not equally punish
all offenders. (3) Be not unequally yoked. Semele is an unfit match for Jupiter
Si qua velis apt nubere, Ovid.
nube pari. If the Earthen pot swims with the Brazen, one touch will break it.
Pry not, peep not into the Ark; The Satyr kissing the lightning burned his
lips. The Fly busy with the Candle burns her wings. The common people must
not come nigh the Hill, where was lightning and thunder, lest they die. Exodus
19. Be content with things revealed, thinking thy self happy that God has made
thee of his court, though not of his counsel. B. Hall.


2. Porphyrion son of Sisyphus by Ops, following the wicked example of his
father, was slain by a thunderbolt.

(1) Patris ad exemplum soboles componitur omnis. Though original sin be
derived by propagation, yet actual sins are for the most part committed by
imitation and example. Patterns work upon us more th^n precepts. A good father
is like a sweet ointment, perfuming all the house, but a wicked one is worse
then the fiery serpent, he stings the children to death of body and soul.
Follow not a multitude to sin, much less a single person; though he be thy
father; lest like sin draw on like judgment.

3. Phaeton son of Sol and Clymene, obtained of his father leave to rule his
chariot one day; but for want of strength and skill, the Horses ran so near
they had almost burned the earth, had not Jupiter struck him down with a
Thunderbolt.

(1) God could not punish a man more sometimes, then in granting him his
desires. The father here grants what an enemy would have wished: thus ruin
comes by indulgence. For History: Phaeton King of the The sports is feigned to
be son of Phoebus, and to fall from his chariot, in that he first assayed to
find out the course of the Sun, but was prevented by death. Not. Com.
In that time abundance of fire fell from heaven, therefore he is said to burn
the world. Physically, Phaeton, as his name signifies, is a bright and burning
inflammation, which proceeds from the Sun. Clymene his mother, is water, from
whom the Sun attracts those exhalations; these set on fire produce a vehement
heat, which thunder and lightning follow; hence he is said to be struck with
lightning by Jupiter. For Morality; Behold here a rash and ambitious Prince,
presented to the life, inflamed with desire of rule. The horses of the Sun are
the common people, unruly and prone to innovation; who finding the weakness of
their Prince, fly into all exorbitances, so to a general confusion.

As Aeolus son, and one of that fierce strain,
Whence Arctos came that seldom threatens rain.
1. Salmonius son of Aeolus (not the King of the winds) was King of Elis, where
he built a City; not so contented, he gave out that he was Jupiter, and to gain
credit to his report, he feigned thunder and lightning, by rattling of brass
pans, and drums in his coach, and casting up squibs into the air: at last
Jupiter by true thunder killed him.

(1) Content is a lesson too hard for the headst of the highest form, a King.
We seldom see an humble Prince, but we commonly see proud beggars. (2)
Tempests beat at lofty Cedars, and thunder smites the highest mountains, when
humble shrubs, and lowest valleys be in safety. (3) We may and must imitate our
Redeemer, as he is Man, in Mercy and Humility; not as he is God, in Miracles
and Majesty.

2. Menius son of Lycaon, brother of Calistho, that was turned into a dry Star
in the North, called Arctos, seeing his father turned into a Wolf, and his
house on fire, railed against Jupiter, and was therefore slain with a
thunderbolt.

(1) The voice of a King is like the roaring of a Lion, but the voice of God
like thunder. A King will do what pleases him, and who dare say, what do
thou? Eccles. 8.3. Who art thou then that contendest with thy Maker, who is
just in all his works and holy in all his ways? A swine will cry, a Lamb is
dumb at the slaughter: so is the good Christian and the bad under the hand of
affliction. Better with Eli say, It is the Lord, let him do what he pleases;
or with the Church to tremble at the judgment of God upon Ananias, etc. then as
Jobs wife bid her husband curse God and die. If we kick against the pricks, we
shall like stubborn Jades be kicked and pricked the more.

As Macedon, by lightning, and her mate,
Were burned, on thee fall like avenging fate.
Macedon a Queen of Macedonia, with her husband, for their impiety were both
burned to death with lightning.

(1) It is dangerous when subjects in a kingdom do give themselves over to
impiety: for when the Body Natural or Politic is diseased, it will affect or
infect the Head. More dangerous when the sickness begins in the head, for all
the members are apt to sympathize. Regis ad exemplum; Therefore Jeroboam in
holy Writ is so often famed with this infamous addition, ( Jeroboam the son of
Nebat that caused Israel to sin.) Though virtue seems more amiable, vice seems
more imitable, chiefly in a Prince. Therefore the strumpet Lais boasted that
she had a greater company at her school, then Socrates at his.

475. Those tear thee whom Latona has exiled
From Delos, 'cause young Thrasus they had killed.
Thrasus a young man coming to offer sacrifice in Diana's Temple, was killed by
dogs, therefore she commanded that no dogs should ever after come near that
place, and sent a plague among them.

(1) Thus the Devil, that hellish Cerberus, who is like a dog in a manger, is
most busy in tempting us, when we are most busy in serving God. So Pharaoh
was never so violent against Israel, as when they were departing from Egypt
toward Canaan; And have not later ages afforded some snarling curres to bite,
and blind whelps to bark at us, when we offer to serve the true God in his holy
Temple? God sent Lions among the Assyrians for hindering devotion, 2 Kings 17.
and plagues upon the Egyptians. Beware of the concision, beware of dogs.

Or those tore him that spied Diana bare,
Or Linus who was King Crotopus heir.
1. Diana bathing her self in the valley of Gergaphia, Acteon by chance beheld
her naked; the blushing and angry Goddess transformes him into the shape of a
long-lived Heart, and his dogs tore him in pieces.

(1) Some Authors report that Diana possessed his dogs with an imagination that
their master was a Heart. And perhaps they ran mad in the Canicular days,
Sandys.
through the power of the Moon, that is Diana, augmented by the entrance of the
Sun into Leo: and what force then could resist the worrying of their master?
Some do aver, that Lucian the Apostata and Atheist came to the like end. But
this Fable may teach us, what dangerous curiosity it is, to search into the
secrets of Princes, or by chance to discover their nakedness, who thereby
incurring their hatred, ever after live the life of an Heart, full of fear and
suspic^on, often accused by their own servants, to their utter ruin. Let us
therefore guard our eyes and ears, nor desire to know or see more then concern
us. Acteon may be said to cast off the mind of a man, and degenerate into a
beast, when he neglected the pursuit of virtue and heroic actions. Some
imagine that he is said to be devoured of his hounds, because he was
impoverished by maintaining them; but what was that expense unto a Prince? I
rather agree with those that think it was by maintaining ravenous and riotous
scycophants, who have too often exhausted the Exchequers of wealthy Princes, and
reduced them to extreme necessity. Those whom we feed at our own tables, will
first seek to cut our throats.

2. Linus son of Apollo and Psammate, daughter of Crotopus King of the Argives,
in fear of her fathers wrath, was hidden among sedge, where dogs came and
devoured him.

(1) Indulgence of too kind mothers, has I confess, undone more children, but
severity of unkind fathers has destroyed too many. Some flying the fury of a
dogged father, have desperately dispatched themselves by a dogs death. Art thou
a father? take heed lest by cruelty to thy own child, thou prove to thy own
self as Menedemus, Heautontimorumenos, thy own tormentor.

Be stung of venomous Snakes no less then she,
480. Oeagrus daughter by Calliope.
Euridice wife to Orpheus, son of Oeagrus and Calliope, sporting among the
herbs and flowers, was stung by a Serpent to death, and was brought to hell,
whither her husband went to redeem her by his Music; by which he drew tears
and consent from Pluto and Proserpina; provided that he looked not behind him
to behold her, before they had past the confines of Styx; but he could not
forbear, so lost her again.

(1) This Fable invites us to moderation in our desires, lest we lose what we
affect, by too much affecting. Hell may seem but mere perturbations of Orpheus
mind, for the death of his beloved, which was pacified by the harmony of
reason, when looking back, that is, recalling her to his remembrance, he falls
into a desperate relapse, and seems to lose her a second time. (2) Justice,
that is, Euridice, and a Prince, that is Orpheus, should be married together.
If this be stung to death by the Serpent of war, the prince by the melodious
harmony of peace should revive it. Orpheus in love ventured to hell to redeem
his wife: Some christians will rather wish their Wives in hell, then strive to
keep, much less to fetch them thence. (3) The soul of man like Euridice,
delighting her self among the flowers of pleasure, was stung by that old
Serpent the Devil, and delivered from the nethermost hell, by the true Orpheus,
Jesus Christ.

Or like Hypsiphiles boy, or who by force,
And point of sword did pierce the wooden horse.
1. Hypsiphile Queen of Lemnos, being condemned for saving her father, when all
the men of the Isle were slain, fled to Nemea, where Lycurgus made her Nurse of
his son Opheltes or Achimorus, who being left by her in a Meadow, was killed by
a Serpent, for which she was sentenced to die, but was preserved by the Argives.

(1) Note here the unconstancy of worldly honor, To day a Queen, to morrow a
Nurse; to day as rich as Croesus, to morrow as poor as Irus. Crowns and
Scepters are slippery things. (2) See how Providence protects and prolongs the
life of those that like Hypsiphile do honor and preserve their parents. (3)
Lycurgus sons name was not only Opheltes, because he was killed by a Serpent,
but Archimorus, from (...) beginning, and (...) death, because he died an
infant; Death loves green fruit as well as ripe, yea green has lately tasted
sweeter then any other, for more Infants died this year (by small pox) then in
any one of this last age.

2. Laocoon son of Priamus King of Troy, was Priest to Apollo, he with the
point of a spear or a sword, pierced the Trojan horse, for which the Gods were
offended, and sent Serpents to kill him, as a despiser of the gift of Pallas.

(1) The Evangelical Prophet Esaias was son of Amos, who (as the best writers
do conceive) was brother to King Azariah. In those times then it seems that
Laocoon the son of a King, and the best of men, thought not themselves too good
to be Priests; but in Jeroboams time, and later days, the worst of men are
made Priests, and Priests are made the worst of men. (2) As sacred things
should not be touched with unwashed hands, so State matters should admit no
vulgar handling. In business of War the Church-mans only weapon should be
prayer, he must not lift up his hand to reform, or his voice to reprove, much
less take up a sword, as Laocoon. (3) Seditious Preachers against the Politic,
and scandalous inveighers against the state Ecclesiastical, have brought
distraction to the State, and destruction to themselves. Dal. Aph.
A Minister should not intrude into the office or place of a Soldier or
Mechanic, nor they into his. Ne suitor ultra crepidam.

No safer then Elpenor climb a ladder,
Let strength of wine make thee so mad or madder.
Elpenor one of Ulysses mates, being drunk with wine, in the house of the
Enchantress Circe, climbed a ladder and broke his neck.

(1) Circe turned many of Ulysses followers into swine, by making them drink of
her charmed cup, and moving her rod over them; wherein perhaps the Devil Aped
Moses rod, with which he wrought such wonders. Circe is so called from mixture,
because the mixture of the Elements is necessary to generation: Sandys.
She turned men into several sorts of beasts, because corruption of the one
begets a form far different from it self. Ulysses could not lose his shape, who
being fortified with immortal power of wisdom, was not subject to mutation.
The body composed of the four Elements is like Ulysses mates, obnoxious to
change, by diseases and corruption, the Soul like Ulysses can by no assault of
nature be converted into a beast, so highly participating of Reason.
Drunkenness breaks the neck of a man's estate, sometimes of his body, as here of
Elpenor. But a man bewitched to a whore shall be brought to a morsel of bread,
and so go down to the chamber of death by famine, if he comes not sooner to his
ladder end.

485. Do thou like each foolhardy Dryops fall,
Whom rash Theodomas to war did call.
Theodomas denies Hylas son of Hercules provision of victuals, Hercules
kills some of his Oxen; Theodomas raises an army against him; Hercules
conquers him, and the people called the Dryopes, that came to aid him.

(1) It is good sleeping (they say) in a whole skin; A man being near drowning
in a river, sinks himself and the party that comes to help him, if he once
catch hold. (2) The Pelican to save her young ones from the fire, which the
shepherds make to catch them, seeks to blow it out with her wings, and so burns
her self. I had rather bewail the fire of dissension afar off, then stir in the
coals, lest I fire my own wings, B. Hall.
before I quench that. In Church-division, I will not meddle more, then by
prayers to God, and entreaties to men, seeking my own safety and the peace of
the Church, in freedom of my thought, and silence of my tongue. (3) That
foolish churlish Nabal, 1 Samuel 25. like Theodomas, denying David some
provision, endangered himself and his whole family.

Or in thy den some valiant man thee slay,
As Cacus whom stoll'n oxen did bewray.
Cacus a mighty Giant, son of Vulcan, depopulated part of Italy that lies about
mount Aventine, with his robberies; he is said to vomit fire, in that he burnt
the corn on the ground, and enviously destroyed what he could not reap. He,
while Hercules slept, took away the best of his oxen, and drew them into his
cave by the tails, that no impression might be seen of any feet going thither,
but they were discovered by their bellowing: So Hercules with his club killed
Cacus.

(1) The she Bear retires backward into her den, that she might not be traced
by the hunter. A cunning thief to avoid susp^cion, turns the shoes of his
stolen horse backward: Such is the Delphick language of ambiguous Turn-coats.
(2) Cacus by interpretation is Evil, which lurkes in Caves, because never
secure, when Hercules or virtue vindicates his own by the destruction of the
other, although with hypocrisy and fraudulent mists he endeavors to conceal
himself.

Who brought, with Lernian poison di'd the gift,
430. And di'd with his blood the Euboean sea and clift.
Licas servant unto Hercules, brought his master a garment dipped in the
poisonous blood of Nessus, for which cause Hercules being enraged, threw him
down a clift into the Euboean sea, where he was turned into a rock.

(1) This rock lying against the Caenean Promontory, resembles a Man, which
perhaps gave an argument to this fiction. (2) It is almost the highest pitch of
Fortune, to be a favorite to a Prince, but it ofttimes proves unfortunate, not
by any guilty intent of the servant, but innocent ignorance of his masters
intention. (3) Rash Kings in an hasty passion, have killed their dearest
friends, as Alexander did Clitus, and Hercules Lycas: It is Hallifax law, first
to condemn and execute, and afterward examine the cause.

Or into Tartar from a rock fall dead,
As he that Platoes book of death had read.
Cleombrotus a Philosopher of the Academick sect, as soon as he had read the
book called Phaedon, concerning the immortality of the soul, compiled by Plato,
who was scholar of Socrates, cast himself down from a rock into the sea,
hastening to enjoy the happiness he had read of.

(1) Summum nec metuas diem, nec optes. No fear, nor wish thy latter end. Be
not ashamed to live, nor afraid to die, nor hasten thy death in hope of a
better life. The soldier ought not to move unless the Commander give the word.
(2) Although our light afflictions are not to be compared to the eternal we^ght
of glory immortal, though we have a crown of righteousness laid up for us, it
is rather with patience to be expected, then preposterously to be snatched. The
kingdom of heaven is not to be caught with such kind of violence. (3) Those
heathen Philosophers may rise up in judgment against these modern Heretics,
that do hold that the body and soul die together.

Or he that Theseus guileful sail did view,
Or as the boy that one from Troyes wall threw.
1. Aegaeus standing on the shore, and seeing the black sail on his son Theseus
ship, at his return from conquering the Minotaure, contrary to his sons
promise to put forth a white one, threw himself down into the sea, which ever
since is called by his name, the Aegaean sea.

(1) As well Joy as Fear distracts the faculties. (2) Prosperity makes a man
forget his own father, many times himself. (3) Parents are not more carefully
mindful of their children, then children are carelessly forgetful of their
Parents. Virgil. Aen.
Omnis in Ascanio chari stat cura parentis. Rivers never return a stream up to
the spring from whence they flow, nor children like love unto their parents.
Wise and true was the ancient saying; To the Gods, Parents, and Teachers,
equivalent recompense cannot be rendered.

2. Astyanax only son of valiant Prince Hector, was by Ulysses thrown headlong
from a Turret of Troy, lest he might afterward claim the kingdom, and take
revenge upon the Greeks.

(1) A Conqueror, if he would securely enjoy what he has won, must pluck up
both branch and root of the former stock. Caesar will endure no superior, nor
Pompey admit an equal: Herod therefore would not only have killed Christ, whom
he heard to be King of the Jews, but burnt the ancient Records of the Kings.
That government whose foundation is laid in blood, and oppression is like a
building, whose groundsels are rotten, it may for a time be under-propped and
kept up, but once falling, no possible means can stay it.

495. Or Bacchus Nurse and Aunt, or who was sent
Headlong, because the saw he did invent.
1. Ino sister of Semele, mother of Bacchus, was his Aunt and Nurse, she being
second wife to Athamas, whom Juno did infuriate, flying her husbands rage, that
would have killed her for a Lioness, and her son Melicertes for a whelp, threw
her self and her son into the sea.

(1) Ino is called among the Greeks Leucothea, among Latins Matuta, or the
Morning. Melicertes is in Greek called Palemon, in Latin Portunus, which
signifies the driving force of storms; he is son of Matuta, the Morning,
because a red morning brings forth tempests. (2) Learn by the pride of Ino, to
be moderate in prosperity; No man knows what, where, or when, shall be his
death. (3) Ino, a Heathen, disdained not to nurse her sisters child, but (the
more shame and pity) some Christians refuse to nurse their own; thus they show
themselves but half-mothers, yea more unnatural to their young ones, then
savage beasts.

2. Perdix, cousin and pupil to Daedalus, rejoicing at the death of Icarus, and
because he was very ingenious (for at twelve years of age he invented the saw)
was in envy thrown down by Daedalus from the top of Minerva's tower in Athens,
but he was supported by the Goddess, and turned to a Partridge, a bird of his
own name.

(1) There is no envy so great and deadly as that between men of the same
profession, as Daedalus and Perdix. Figulus Figulo invidet. Nay some will
violate all obligations to remove the rivals of their praise; wishing their
necks broke that they may not stand in their light. But Minerva or admirable
Art sustains, and gives life to happy endeavors.

Or as the Lydian girl whose neck was broke,
'Cause against Mars reviling words she spoke.
Ilice daughter of Ibicus a Lydian, being lustfully beloved of Mars, by the
help of Diana was kept from his violence, yet she reviled against him,
wherewith Mars being much incensed, killed her father, with which Ilice being
much grieved, fell mad, and threw her self from a rock into the sea.

(1) Innocent virginity had been too often a prey to the impetuous soldiery of
Mars, had not preserving providence made a rescue. (2) A railing and reviling
tongue bespeaketh destruction to it self and friends. But why should Ibicus the
father suffer when the child offends? Perhaps the offense came by him, for want
of due correction, restriction and instruction. The Mother in the fable rather
deserved to be hanged then her son, for that she connived and not whipped him,
being a boy, for stealing a book at school. (3) Grief for loss of friends
deceased is a sign of love, not to them but our selves. It is misery enough to
lose a father, why should I double it, in losing my self too?

Meet in thy field a whelping Lioness,
500. Let her thee kill as one did Paphages.
Paphages King of Ambracia, in his walk meeting a Lioness with whelp, was
killed by her.

(1) Paphages may be a fat rich Prince, the Lioness with her whelps may be a
numerous army invading his plenteous kingdom. (2) In natural bodies the longer
they subsist in perfect health, Dal. Aph.
the more dangerous is the disease, when it comes, and the longer in curing,
as having none of these humors spent, which by distemper give foment and force
to the approaching malady: So it is in the body Politic, when war once seiseth
upon a Country, rich in the plenties of a long peace, and full with the
surfeit of continual ease, it never leaves purging those superfluities till all
be wasted and consumed. Thus the roaring Lion of hell falls upon a soul being
full and secure.

As to Lycurgus son that climbed a tree,
And Idmon bold, a Bore thy ruin be.
(1) Butes (whom some authors call Ancaus, or Angaeus) son of Lycurgus King of
Thrasia, being fiercely pursued by a Bore, climbed a tree, but before he was
up, the Bore pulled him down again and slew him.

(1) This when we are climbing the tree of knowledge and sublime understanding
of divine truth, that Bore of the wilderness, the Heretic, labors to pluck us
back into errors. Thus when we are ascending the tree of life toward heaven,
that Serpentine Satan endeavors to draw us back, into deadly sin, and damned
Hell.

2. Idmon a southsayer, among the Argonauts, was in Bythinia slain by a Bore.

(1) Southsayers and Astrologers can foreshew to others what evils they may
shun, but cannot prevent what hangs over their own heads; Thales gazing on
the Stars fell into a ditch. Nequicquam sapit, qui sibi non sapit. If thou be
wise, be wise unto thy self. The Bell rolls in others to sermon, but hears not
a word it self. Moses brought the Israelites to Canaan, but entered not in
himself. Many (I fear) show others the way to heaven, and come short
themselves. Sic vos non vobis mellificatis Apes.

A Bore thy deaths wound give, when he is dead,
As upon whom fell such a creatures head.
Thoas a famous hunter in Andragathia, was wont to hang on a tree the head and
feet of all he caught, as a sacrifice to Diana; at last having got a mighty
Bore, he kept the feet and hanged up only the head by a string, which fell
upon him, being a sleep under the tree.

(1) Although the Priests were allowed part of the Jewish sacrifice, the whole
was offered unto God. (2) If so fearful and sudden death befell Ananias and
Saphira, because they detained part of their own gift devoted to the Church,
Acts 5. what may sacrilegious latrons expect, who never gave to the Church as
much as one of the widows mites, yet take from it to their own use, the most
part of that was given to others? (3) Offer not to God the blind or the lame,
serve not God by halfes, but give him the honor due unto his name; being
Holocausts, whole presents to him the^ ought to be feared. God might justly
require all, yet he accepts the tenths of our means, and the seventh of our
time, shall we grudge him that? God forbid.

505. Like them be thou, whom fruit of Pine Tree killed,
As Phrygia's hunter, and Berentius child.
Atys a Phrygian hunter, and Nauclus son of Berentius, sleeping under a
Pine Tree, were both slain by apples falling from the same tree.

(1) Mill modis morimur mortales, nascimur uno. By one way we are born, by
thousands we die. As God can save by small means, so he can destroy. Death is a
long sleep, and sleep a short death; some have fallen into such a deadly sleep
they never waked. Lie down therefore with the Prophet David's petition in thy
mouth or heart; Lord lighten mine eyes that I sleep not in death, Psalm. 13.

And if to Minos sands thou voyage make,
Let Cretians thee for a Sicilian take.
For the death of Minos King of Crete, killed in Sicilia by King Cocalus or his
daughter, in the pursuit after Daedalus, the Cretians ever since so hate that
people, that they put all to death that arrive in those coasts.

(1) The Aspick pursues him which has hurt or killed his mate, and knows him
among a multitude; him he still hunteth and lays for his life, breaking
through all difficulties and dangers to come unto him: Dall. Aph.
So is revenge furiously out-ragious, and out-ragiously furious. Yea for the
cause of one single person, families, cities, kingdoms fall at variance, and
hardly or never be reconciled. In revenge of one Dinah, Simeon and Levi
destroyed all the Sichemits, Genesis 34. but cursed was their wrath, Genesis 49.7.

510. As to Alebas daughter it befell,
And to her husband, let a house thee quell.
Alcidice daughter of Alebas, a Larissean, with her husband Lycoris, by the
fall of their house were slain.

(1) Whether these persons suffered this punishment for any offense to the Gods
(for the father Alebas was an oppressor) or their house fell by chance, I read
not. But holy Writ reports, that while Jobs children were rioting, the house
fell down and killed them. I will wind up this ap^lication with our Saviors
caveat unto the Jews, and in them to all; Think ye that those on whom the
tower of Shilo fell, were greater sinners more then you? verily, I say unto
you, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish, Luke 13.

As Tiberinus and Evenus named
The streams, where they were drowned, be thou so famed.
Tiberinus or Tiberius King of the Albans, was drowned in the river Albiola,
which since is called Tibris, or Tiberis, after his name. So Evenus, son of
Mars and Marpesse was drowned in the river Lycormas, and gave that river his
name Evenus.

(1) The noblest honor the ancients could invent for the dead, was a glorious
Monument, with their Names, Titles, and Deserts: but,

Auson.
Mors etiam faxis, nominibusque venit. Death as well seizes upon Monuments as
Men. (2) Immortal fame was the utmost hope of the Heathen after death* And what
more does that Christian expect, who takes more care to have houses called of
his name, then his soul in an heavenly mansion? The Lord be pleased to write my
name in the book of life, then let my fame on earth be as mortal as my body.

As Hyrtacus his son one fix thee dead
Upon a stake, let man's food be thy head.
Nisus son of Hyrtacus, adventuring to redeem his friend Eurialus, being caught
by the army of the Kutilians, willingly endured the same death with him, their
bodies were cast to be eaten by men, and their heads put upon stakes.

(1) He that is a friend to all, is a friend to none; he that sincerely is a
friend to one, is truly a friend to himself: for a friend is second self. Let
no man therefore, like Janus, bear two faces under one hood, nor blow hot and
cold out of one mouth. Let friends like Harpocrates twins, laugh and cry
together, partake and sympathize in every estate. Learn of our voluntary
friend, and undeserved Savior, that freely died, not with us, but for us, not
for his friends, but enemies.

515. As Brotheus did, when death was his desire
Thy body cast into a flaming fire.
Brotheus, son of Minerva by Vulcan, because he was jeered for his deformed
body, cast himself into the fire and died.

(1) Vasius that deformed Roman, to prevent others, would, first jeer himself.
(2) What nature fails in one, is recompensed in another part. Who more ugly
shapen then Aesop? who more ingenious? Better have the Foxes soul body and
witty mind, then like the Leopard to be fair and foolish. Siqua latent meliora
puto. Let no man call his brother Racha or fool, mocking him for deformity of
his body, or infirmity of mind; lest he incur the judgment, Mat. 5. But why,
because others deride me should I destroy what God has formed? It is he that
made us, not we our selves. Praised be his name that he made me a Man, not a
Toad. The Potter might have made me a vessel of dishonor as well as honor.

Or suffer death shut in a Cave, as he
That did compile the gainless Tragedy.
Cherilus wrote the acts of Alexander the great: For every good verse in his
Poem, he was promised a crown of gold, and for every bad one a lash: of all his
verses only seven were allowed, the number of the bad was so great that he was
lashed to death in a secret room. Hereupon Alexander was wont to say, that he
had rather be, in Homer, deformed Thersites, then, in Cherilus, the valiant
Achilles.

(1) The Muses are the daughters of Apollo and Mnemosyne, to express Poetry
that divine inspiration nourished by memory. Eupheme was their nurse, for
praise does cherish noble endowments. Their habitation was Parnassus and
Helicon, pleasant places; For Poetry is a most delightful study. The Muses were
crowned with green and bitter leaves of Laurel; for the pains of Poets are
bitter, and constant: They are Women for their pregnancy in knowledge: They are
Nine; of the tripple Trine, which flows from the perfection of number: from
these premises I may conclude; That Dull-man Cherilus, that ventures on Poetry,
and Dominus Mechanic, that leaps from the panel to the pulpit, deserves as
much a whip as the dull Ass that presumed to the Harp.

Or as he perished that Iambicks penned,
520. So let thy saucy tongue procure thy end.
Archilochus, who first invented the Iambick verse, was banished by the
Lacedaemonians, and afterward slain by Crocalus a soldier; and his books
condemned.

(1) Sometimes wit becomes a Woe, and Books a bane; Non hunc quaesitum munus in
usum. Thus banishment was the bitter doom of my sweet Poet Ovid. The pen and
the tongue be the gates as well of death as life: Dip not therefore thy pen in
gall, lest it prove to thee like the writing on the wall unto Belshazzar.
Rather then so,

Scinde leves calamos, and frange Thalia libellos. Break thy pens and tear thy
books my Muse. (2) Let thy speech be seasoned with salt, that it may minister
grace to the hearers* (3) If thou speak what thou should not, thou will
hear what thou would not.

As who with halting verse against Athens railed,
And hateful di'd after his victua's sailed.
Aristophanes reviling against the praise of Athens, which the Orators before
had so highly extolled, was by public command famished to death. This is
reported by Alcyat of Hipponactes, that railed against one Athenis in verses
called Seazons, which are lame or halting Iambicks.

(1) When Fame is once fled out, Pegasus will hadly overtake it. If thou art
cried up by a st^ong opinion of the Grandees; the rabble of the vulgar will
never cry thee down. What is one malapert Aristophanes against all Athens?
That Is but an Owl who thinks with his single note to drown the warble of an
hundred Nightingals. He deserves to feed upon the Commons like an Ass that
brayes out his simple No, when the general vote of the whole house has
pronounced I.

As that harsh Lyrick Poet died, so may
Thy hand prove false, and be thy own decay.
Alcaeus the Lyrick Poet brake his promise which he made to Pittacus, by
joining right hands, and after railed also against him with bitter jeers and
mocks, for which at last he was banished.

(1) A man's eye and his honor are two tender pieces, Dall. Aph.
the one cannot abide the rough touch of the hand, nor the other endure the
smart jerk of the tongue. As therefore by the owners they are carefully
preserved, so by others that deal with them, they should be tenderly used. (2)
Such pregnant wits as had rather lose their friend then their jest, must learn
the lesson that is taught a soldier, to take heed while they level and
discharge upon others, they lie not so open that they be hit themselves.

525. To Agamemnons son a Serpent gave
Deaths wound, so Poison bring thee to thy grave.
Orestes son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, for killing his mother and Aegystus
the Adulterer, as also for murdering Pyrrhus King of Epirus, was so haunted
with Furies, that he could not be expiated till he had sacrificed on the Altar
of Diana Taurica, at last by divine justice he was stung to death by a Serpent.

(1) Furies are the stings and torments of a guilty conscience, which are the
rudiments of the pains of hell, therefore some are of opinion that there is no
hell but in the conscience. (2) What those Barbarians rashly said of Paul when
the viper fastened on his hand, Acts 28. (surely this man is a murderer, whom
thought he escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffers not to live) may be truly
said of Orestes, He escaped the sentence of the judges, and the torments of the
Furies, yet the venomous serpent suffered him not to live, but killed him.

Thy marriage first night be thy last of life,
So di'd Eupolis, and his new 'spous'd wife.
Eupolis an Athenian (there was also a Poet of that name) the first night he
lay with his wife Medulla (or Glycerium) they were both struck dead. Of which
subject there is an Epigram 3 Antholog. So Quintas Sertullius a Roman, with his
wife, were strangled the first night they lay in bed together. Servius on the
first of Virgils Aeneids reports, that Hymenaeus with his wife were quelled the
first night of their marriage; therefore at Nuptials for expiation he is
invocated as a God.

(1) If such untimely death happened to man and wife in their lawful marriage
bed, what may those impudent wretches that commit fornication and adultery look
for? Me thinks they should fear that judgment would surprise them in the very
act, as Zimri and Cosbi whom Phineas slew both together, and the execution was
allowed by God himself. (2) Dionysius died laughing: Attalus King of the Hunnes
died of Euexia, excess of health; so in the midst of jollity, mirth and
pleasure, death may be in the pot.

As Lycophron that buskin-Poets heart,
530. So let in thine be stuck a fatal dart.
Lycophron, one of the seven ancient Poets, that were called Pleiades (the
other six were Theocritus, Aratus, Nicander, Apollonius, Philetus, Homerus
Junior) wrote an obscure Poem called Alexandria, containing the prophecy of
Cassandra, from Hercules to Alexander; at last contending about priority, he
was by an adversary slain with an arrow.

(1) Ambition is torment enough for an Enemy; for it affords as much
coffeehouse in enjoying as want, making men like poisoned Rats, which when
they have tasted of their ban^, cannot rest till they drink, and then can much
less rest till they die. It is a fools paradise, and wilful unquietness. (2)
Ambition is still climbing, but not on Jacobs ladder, for the higher it mounts,
the farther it is from heaven: yet this sin does ambitiously insinuat among the
best, as Satan among the children of God, Joh 1. It crept into the very hearts
of Christ's own disciples, they strove as Lycophron, who should be the greatest.

Let kinsfolks through a wood thy torn limbs rake,
As him at Thebes, whose grandsire was a snake.
Pentheus grandchild of Cadmus, that was turned into a Snake, despising the
religion in Thebes, established by Bacchus the God of wine, notwithstanding the
counsel and requests of Cadmus and Athamas, with all speed would alter it; His
mother, with his Aunts Ino and Autonoe, all distracted with the fury of
Bacchus, supposing Pentheus to be a Bore, transfixed him with Javelins, and
tore him in pieces.

(1) Noah was first after the flood that planted vineyards, and taught men the
use of wine; therefore some write, that of Noachus, he was called Boachus,
Sandys.
and afterward by the Heathens Bacchus, by contraction or ignorance of
Etymology. (2) Nothing, as King Pentheus well perceived, can more please the
vulgar, then Innovation of government and religion: to this they do throng in
multitudes. (3) Wise Princes should rather endeavor to pacify then violently
oppose a popular fury, which like a torrent breaks all before it, but being let
alone exhausteth it self, and is easily suppressed. Reformation is therefore to
be wrought by degrees, lest through their too forward zeal they encounter too
strong opposition, and ruin themselves and the cause, as this Pentheus did.
(3) The blind rage of superstition extinguisheth all affection. Agave murders
her own son, and their Aunt their Nephew; Nor have the latter ages been
unacquainted with such horrors.

Or as the imperious wife of Lycas, thou
Be dragged by Bulls along a mountain brow.
Lycas King of Boeotia first married Antiopa, she was got with child by Epopus,
and was brought to bed of Zethus and Amphion, whom she fathered upon Jupiter.
Dirce second wife to Lycas, caused Antiopa to be bound with chains; by prayer
to Jupiter her chains are loosed and she freed, her sons drag Dirce at Bulls
tails, the Gods turn her into a fountain.

(1) Many sin willingly as Antiopa, and lay the blame on God, whereas God
tempts no man to that which he hates, forbids and punishes, but every
man is tempted of his own lust. (2) Adultery overthrows whole families. Antiopa
was the cause of her own divorce and imprisonment, or her husbands death, and
the murder of Dirce. (3) In distress, as Antiopa, pray unto God, he will not
only loose thy chains and open the prison gate, as to Paul and Sylas, but in
the end he will loose the chains of death, and open the prison of the grave.

535. As the Harlots to her sisters husband let,
Thy tongue cut out, fall down before thy feet.
Tereus ravished Philomela his wises sister, and cut out her tongue. Progne
revengeth it by killing their son Itys. Tereus is turned into a Lapwing,
Philomela into a Nightingall, and Progne to a Swallow; of this read more before.

(1) Pausanias observes, that no Nightingall does sing, nor Swallow build in
Thracia, as hating the country of Tereus. But where Swallows build the
Archietecture of their nest is admirable, and to rob it or pull it down was
among some people held not only unfortunate, but sacrilegious. When cold
weather comes, and Flies which are their chiefest food be gone, they creep into
the clefts of rocks, or sink to the bottom of a water. Mr Burton and Mr Sandys
do report, that it is not extraordinary to draw Swallows out of some ponds with
the fish, which do seem dead, but being put in a stove, or to the fire, they
revive and take them to their wing.

As Blesus that knew Myrrha dulled to a tree,
So childless found may thou in all parts be.
Blesus it seems first knew the virtue of the Myrrh tree, for he was
childless. And Dioscorides says, that Myrrh opens the Matrix, and helps
childbirth, and why not child-begetting? Ovid here wishes Ibis, that though
he should change many climats, and many wives, yet he should still be
childless. Which doubtless is an heavy curse and reproach to man, as Barrenness
among the Jews was to a woman: For he heapeth up riches and cannot tell who
shall gather them. See more of Myrrha before.

(1) Myrrha is feigned to be turned into a tree, because after that horrid fact
in the fruition of her own fathers bed, she ever after hid her self, and though
unsensibly, she shed bitter tears for her transgression, signified by the gum
distilled from that tree. (2) This tree does prosper the better when the root
is boared, and distills most juice in blustering winds: So an upright settled
mind remains immovable, and I bears most fruits of virtue in the storms of
envy and affliction, appearing more comfortable and glorious, being oppressed.
Virescit vulnere virtus.

Let busy Bees fix in thine eyes their stings,
540. Such creatures to Achaeus did like things.
Achaeus devising a Poem in his garden, was stung in the eyes with bees, and so
made blind.

(1) Thus envious enemies of the Gospel of peace, as busy bees (or rather
wasps) put pricks in our eyes to blind us, that we might not see the truth. But
behold and taste that honey-like comfort of the sweet singer of Israel; They
came about me like bees, yet they are extinct, as the fire among the thorns,
for in the name of the Lord will I destroy them. Nay they will destroy
themselves; As wheresoever a be stings, she leaves her sting behind, and then
turns a buzzing idle drone, despicable to all ingenious, industrious bees.

Fixed to a rock, gnawed be thy bowels, as
He to whom Pyrrha brothers daughter was.
Prometheus, brother to Epimetheus, that was father of Pyrrha, for his bringing
fire out of heaven unto earth, was bound on the hill Caucasus, where an Eagle
fed upon his heart.

(1) Menander the Greek Poet thinks that Prometheus was thus tormented, not
because he brought fire from heaven, but because he bought woman (which is
worse) into the earth. (2) Our daily labors be refreshed by sleep at night, as
Prometheus heart. Cura cor urit.

Renew the pattern of Thyestes meat,
Thee like Harpagus son thy father eat.
Harpagus, because he killed not Cyrus, as his grand father King Astyages had
commanded him, was invited by the King to a feast, where Harpagus own son was
the chiefest dish, being killed, and his limbs sod and roast. Read this history
at large in Justin. l. 1. So was Thyestes served by his brother Atreus. Good
Authors do relate this of Harpalice, who being forced by her father Clymenus,
when she was delivered, killed the child, and made it for her fathers table. Of
Thyestes read before.

(1) Maugre all the bloody malice, and preventing plots of Astyages, Cyrus his
grandchild and right heir is preserved, and proves the best of all the Kings
that ever ruled the Medes and Persians. The Prophet Esaias calls him the servant
of God; it was he that caused the Temple of Jerusalem to be reedified. Thus
Moses was saved from drowning. Paul from killing If God be with us, who can be
against us?

545. Be hacked in pieces by the sword of foes,
So was Mamerthes, as the story goes.
Mamerthes, brother of Sisapon, King of Corinth, desiring to be King, killed
the young Prince, for which bloody ambitious fact, Sisapon caused him to be
torn in pieces. Some copies of this part of Ovid, for Mamerthes read Nycernus
and Mycernus.

(1) See in Mamerthes the bloody means and the end of ambition. How more noble
was that conscientious Heathen Lycurgus, though Eunomus, his brother, the king
of Sparta was dead, himself by election in his place, solicited by the Queen
to marry with her, yet when he perceived that she was with child by the King,
he put her off with sweet delays until the birth; when she was delivered, he
presented the young Prince unto the Nobles, saying, This is your King, not I.
So by common consent the child was, named Charilaus, that is, the grace, honor
or love of the people. Hence it is thought came the renowned name of Carolus.
This is the heir, said the Jews, come let us kill him, and the inheritance
shall be ours; but by killing Christ, they like the dog in the fable, lost both
what they had and what they hoped for.

As Syracusa 's Poet be thou rop'd,
So let the passage of thy breath be stopped.
Theocritus the worthiest of all the pastoral Poets, whom Virgil does imitate,
lived at Syracusae, where for railing against King Hiero, he was brought to the
gallows, and fixed in a halter; in this posture, being asked if he would recant
and forbear, he railed the more; so by the Kings command, though he were
brought thither in jest, he was hanged at last in earnest.

(1) Poetical license has been allowed for quantity of Syllables, not for rash
liberty of speech against persons of quality and power. Saint Jude that forbids
to have any persons in admiration, forbids also to despise the powers, or speak
evil of dignities. Nero the worst of Emperors ruled, when Saint Paul exhorted
every soul to be subject to the higher powers. Therefore thou shall not revile
the governor of Gods people, though he were a Jeroboam; for we must obey him
for conscience sake. Michael the Archangel, one of the best creatures, in a
very good cause, against the worst enemy of us all, the very Devil, would use
no railing words, but said, The Lord rebuke thee, Jud. 9.

Thy skin plucked off, let naked flesh appear,
500. Like his whose name a Phrygian brook does bear.
Marsyas, a man very skilful in wind-instruments, called a Satyr, for his rude
and lascivious composures, presumed to challenge Apollo with his harp; being
overcome, he had his skin stripped over his ears. The rural deplore their pipers
death, and raise a river of his own name with their tears. The Phrygians did
believe that the stream sprung from his blood. See more before.

(1) Marsyas is feigned to have the tail of a Swine, because audacious attempts
have shameful ends: Curtius reports, that the river Marsyas falls from the top
of a Mountain on subjacent rocks, with a mighty murmur, and passing thence,
glides on in a quiet current: feigned a piper to have his skin stripped off, and
dissolved into water, because murmur of water renders a kind of harmony; the
river suddenly changed by his abated violence, as if uncased of his skin,
assuming another color, and becoming more Chrystallin. (2) Marsyas the
Inventer of wind instruments may resemble ambition and vainglory, which
delights in shouts and loud applauses, but virtue and wisdom have a sweeter
touch, though they make not so great a noise in popular opinion.

Look on Medusa's face that turns to stone
Men, and did many Cipheus kill alone.
Medusa, daughter of Phorcus, transformed all that looked upon her into Marble.
Perseus furnished with the shield of Pallas, and falchion of Mercury, having
got from the Graeae the other two Gorgons, the one eye which they both used in
common, cuts off Medusa's head, yet looks not on her, but only sees her
deformity, in the shield of Pallas.

(1) We are taught by this fable, that no great action should be taken in hand
without the advice of Pallas, that is, wisdom. (2) Perseus attempts her alone,
that of all the rest was mortal. So we should pursue such designs that are
feisible, not vast and endless. He striking, looks on the shield of Pallas; so
must we by providence prevent instant dangers. (3) Perseus may be the
reasonable soul, the Graeae knowledge and wisdom, got by old experience,
without whose eye or conduction, Medusa, Lust, and the enchantment of bodily
beauty stupifies our senses, making us unuseful, and converts us as it were
into stone. (4) Perseus killed Medusa; so Reason corporal pleasure: he looks
not on her but only in the shield of Pallas (as we may safely look upon the
Eclipse of the Sun in water) It is not safe to behold what our hearts are prone
to consent to. Therefore Job wisely made a covenant with his eyes. Perseus with
the sight of Medusa's head, killed Cypheus and all his mates, that came to take
from him his new married wife Andromeda.

The bite of Potnia Mares with Glaucus feel,
Into the Sea with the other Glaucus reel.
1. Glaucus a man of Potnia, hindered his Mares from the use of Horses; they in
their madness tore him to pieces.

(1) Naturam expellas furca licet, usque recurret. Cross nature with a fork,
'twill have recourse. Art and Education may correct and qualify nature, not
confound and nullify it. (2) Custom is another nature. When ancient liberties
and accustomed immunities are denied and debarred; the brutish multitude will
use their utmost force and violence against the infringer. Naturae sequitur
semina quodque suae.

2. Glaucus, a second of that name, a man of Boeotia, an excellent swimmer, and
a fisher, coming with a burden of fish to the city Anthedon, he sat on the
grass to rest, and laid his fish by him, seeing one of the fishes, by biting of
an herb revive, he ate of the same herb, and leaped into the sea, and was made
a sea-God.

(1) There is none of so low and mean condition, whom extraordinary eminency in
commendable arts and faculties cannot make immortal. Barbarossa a fisher-mans
son made King of Tunis. Massinello a fisherman, in few years past, was, though
for no long time, commander of all Naples. Columbus by his glorious discoveries
more justly deserved a place for his ship among the Southern Constellations,
then ever the Argonauts by their so much honored Argo. Peter and James and
John, of fishermen were called to be Apostles here, and Saints in Heaven.

555. Let Gnossian honey choke thy soul, as his
Whose name like those two lastly mentioned is.
Glaucus a third of that name, son of Mino^ and Pasiphae, playing with a
tennis-ball, fell into a barrel of honey, and there died. Polyidus a Physician,
was shut up with the dead body in a room, that he might restore him to life:
Seeing a Serpent coming toward the body, he provoked him on purpose to be
killed by him, but by chance he killed the Serpent: Another Serpent comes to
the dead Serpent, and with an herb revives it; Polyidus with the same herb
restores to life the dead body of young Glaucus.

(1) If by playing with the unconstant ball of the world we are drowned in
mellifluous pleasures, whereby our souls are dead in sins and trespasses: none
but Polyidus, our knowing Physician, Christ, by the sovereign herb of grace can
revive us to evarlasting life.

Or guilty drink with trembling hand that cup
Which Socrates undauntedly sucked up.
Socrates, though by the Oracle of Apollo he was accounted the wisest, and by
the vote of all men the honestest, yet by three envious neighbors Anytus,
Lycon, and Melytus, being falsely accused, he was by the Judges condemned: so
drunk to his enemy Anytus a cup of poison wherewith he died.

(1) There are sons of Belial, knights of the post, knaves that be-lie-all by
false accusation, will soon hang one true honest man. And what will not malice
and envy act, chiefly being backed with power? rather then not see his
neighbors two eyes out, the envious man will gladly pluck out one of his own.
Those persecuting prosecutors of Socrates, some were banished, someslain. Pilat
though he knew that the Jews had delivered Jesus only for envy, yet condemned
him; He having drank of gall and vinegar, a health to his enemies, died upon
the Cross; but the Traitor suffered a more dishonorable death.

If thou do love, the steps of Haemon tread,
560. As Macareus, do thou thy sister wed.
Haemon married his own sister Rhodope, therefore the Gods revenging so foul a
fact, turned them both into mountains.

(1) Peruse the histories of all the ancient authors, and you will scarce find
one among an hundred of that unlucky brood, sprung from incestuous parents, but
was monstrously inhumane and bloody: and the end of the parents ominous. Haemon
and Rhodope were turned into mountains: In mountains and hills brute beasts do
promiscuously couple without distinction or relation of brother, sister, dam or
sire; I hope this beastly heathenish vice is not so much as named among
Christians, therefore it shall not defile my pen, nor offend my readers eyes or
ears, for me.

Concerning Macareus and Canace read before.

See thou as when the fire burned all things down,
What Hectors son did from his fathers town.
How Ulysses cast down Astyanax son of Hector from the walls of Troy, read
before.

Perish like him whose grand-sire was his sire,
His sister, mother, by incestuous fire.
Adonis, begotten by Cynaras on his own daughter Myrrha, was slain by a bore,
whose death Venus lamented with bitter tears, and converted him into a flower,
which some call Anemony.

(1) Men of excellent beauties have been subject to miserable destinies. Raro
forma viris impunita fuit. (2) This lamentation for Adonis is mentioned under
the name Tammuz, which Jerome takes for Adonis; but Tremelius, for Osyris,
Ezech. 8. Allegorically both are one. Now Adonis was no other then the Sun,
adored under that name by the Phoenicians, Sandys.
as Venus by the name Astarten: for the Naturalists call the upper Hemisphere
of the earth which we inhabit, Venus, and the lower part Proserpina: Venus wept
when Adonis was dead; so when the Sun enters into the six Winter-signs of the
Zodiac, the widdowed earth weeps, overflowed with rain. Adonis in the Hebrew
signifies Lord, [(...)]
and the Sun is Lord of all the Planets. Adonis was killed by a bore; so the
savage horrid winter delighting in mire and cold, like a bore, unfit for Venus,
does as it were kill the Sun, diminishing his heat and luster. Thus not only
the factious little foxes of schism do pluck off her grapes, but the wild bore
of Heresy endeavors to root up and kill the vineyard, the Church of Christ.

565. Let such a kind of dart in thy bones stick,
As Icarus son-in-law to death did prick.
Ulysses, husband of Penelope, who was Icarus daughter, was slain by a dart
thrown unawares from the hand of his own son Telegonus, near his Palace in
Ithaca, after that he had returned safe from Troy.

(1) No General, though so wise, valiant and triumphant as Ulysses, having
passed the pikes, pistols and swords of the enemy, can escape the dart of the
last enemy, which is death; and that if providence so permit, by the hand of
one that is most near and dear. Alexander that conquered all the world, was
killed by a cup of wine from his own Butlers hand. (2) The time, manner and
place of death is as much uncertain as death it self is certain. Let us
therefore, with the Poet, think everyday the last; let us with Job, expect
every hour, till our change come; let us still pray with the Church; From
sudden death good Lord deliver us.

Like Anaxarchus be in mortar pound,
Thy scattered bones like common grain resound.
Anaxarchus, a Philosopher of Abdera, being condemned by Nicocrean, Tyrant of
Cyprus, to be pound with iron pestels in a mortar, suffered that torment so
undauntedly, that he often repeated this memorable speech, Pound Tyrant, pound
Anaxarchus his wind-bag, thou poundest not Anaxarchus. Being threatened that his
tongue should be cut out, he bit it off in pieces, and spit it in the Tyrants
face.

(1) I do confess that this Heathen was an unparalleled piece of Heroic
valor, but it merits the title of an effect of revengeful active malice,
rather then a testimony of patient passive martyrdom, in comparison of
Christians. Hear the language of Saint Laurence, who being laid naked on a
burning gridiron, is reported to have said thus; Tyrant, turn the other side,
this is broyl'd enough. Those glorious Martyrs in Queen Mary's fierce
persecution, kissed the flame, and clipped the stake, being fully assured that
upon the wheels of faith, in that fiery chariot with Elijah, they should be
carried into heaven.

And as the pratler off his horse fell dumb,
570. The passage of thy throat choke with thy thumb.
Agenor, a pratler, not sparing Jupiter himself in his reviling talk, fell off
his horse and choked himself with his own thumb.

(1) Nature it self has bound the tongue to the good behavior, and shut it
within the outward prison of the lips, and the inward of the teeth, yet the
unruly member is always apt to break out: But for so little a creature to fly
out against Jupiter her Creator, deserves death, not only sudden, but eternal.

Like Psamate's father, thee let Phoebus throw
To deepest hell; he used his daughter so.
Orchamus King of Babylon, perceiving that his daughter Leucotho^e had lain
with Apollo, buried her alive. Apollo not able to revive her, sprinkled Nectar
upon her grave, whence a Frankincense tree ascended; and used her father as he
had used his daughter.

(1) See here the disposition of a cruel father; though the offense of a child
be great, the punishment of a father should be gentle. Pro peccato magno
paululum supplicii satis est patri. It is unnatural for a man to be cruel,
Terence.
whose name should mind him of pity; Homo ab humanitate: but for a father to be
cruel, is hard and barbarous.

(2) Frankincense serves for many uses in Physic, whereof Apollo is the God.
It grows in Sabaea, as naturally loving heat; therefore Apollo and Leucotho^e
are feigned reciprocal lovers. (2) Frankincense smells not sweet, unless it be
melted by the Sun or fire: so prayers in themselves have no savor, unless
inflamed with zeal and devotion, expressed in the Ceremonial Law, by the Censer.

Such monster spoil Thine, as Chroraebus killed,
That ease unto poor Grecians did yield.
Linus begot by Apollo upon Psamathe, daughter of Crotopus King of Argives, was
killed by his grandfathers dog: In revenge whereof, Apollo sent a monster to
plague the Country called Paena, that would pull the Infants from the mothers
breast, and kill them before their faces: This monster was slain by Choraebus.

(1) A trivial saying there is, that Wine, Women and Dogs be the occasions of
most part of mischiefs. (2) For a personal offense, though suffered, not acted,
comes a National punishment, as here for Crotopus dogs. This Monster may be
some filthy catching disease, as the small Pox, that plucks away and destroys
Infants. Choraebus the skilful Physician Conquers and kills it.

575. As Aethra's Nephew slain by Venus wrath,
Let scared horses drag thee unto death.
Hippolitus, son of Theseus by Antiope, who had denied Venus a courtesy, upon
false accusation of his stepmother Phaedra, that he should tempt her chastity,
was by his credulous father abjured, and cursed to death: which Neptune
accomplished; for the horses of Hippolitus, affrighted with a sea calf, threw
him down and dragged him to pieces on the ^ock. Aesculapius restores him to
life, and changes his ominous name Hippolitus, to Virbius, signifying twice a
Man.

(1) Curses of parents fall heavy upon children, though undeserved. (2) Rash
belief is the author of much mischief, and unsuspended wrath of too late
repentance: The chaste youth suffers for another inchastity; but virtue, though
for a time afflicted, cannot be finally suppressed. (3) This Virbius by some is
thought to be a cunning impostor, suborned by the Priests of Diana Aricina, to
draw a greater concourse to that grove, that their gain may increase by more
frequent devotion. And have not others in later days used such incredible
forgeries, to serve their own turn?

One host for his great wealth his guest did slay;
For thy small wealth thy host make thee away.
Polymnestor, to enjoy the gold sent by King Priamus to him, with his son
Polydorus, killed the young Prince his pupil. Read more before.

(1) The wisest Creator has placed the basest part of his creatures as gold
and silver under our feet, the noblest over our heads, on purpose that we
should neglect and scorn the one, admire and love the other; yet we by a simple
conversion, or Hysteron Proteron, embrace the worst, and slight the best,
trampling under foot affinity, consanguinity, fidelity, yea Christianity, and
humanity it self, for filthy lucres sake, losing the crown of glory to gain a
crown in gold. Virgil.
Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, Auri sacra fames?

With Damasicthon were six brothers slain,
580. So of thy kin let none alive remain.
Amphion King of Thebes, had by Niobe seven daughters, and seven sons, whose
names were Ismenus, Siphus, Phedinus, Tantalus, Alphenor, Damasicthon, and
Ilioneus. The daughters were slain by Diana, and the sons by Apollo's arrows,
because Niobe presumed to prefer her self before Latona, and Niobe was turned
into a Marble.

(1) Wealth and honor engender pride in the hearts of Mortals, whence proceeds
the contempt of God and man, and insolent forgetfulness of humane instability.
Thus from the height of glory, by divine vengeance they are made spectacles of
calamity, and subject to their pity, whom they formerly despised; so wanting
valor to support, and virtue to make use of afflictions, with immoderate
sorrow they are besotted and stupefied like stones. (2) A raging plague in
Boeotia swept away the children of Niobe, with other people, which is caused by
extreme heat, and contagious vapors, signified by Apollo's arrows, and Diana.
Niobe is said to be turned into a stone, because excessive sorrow made her
senseless.

Senec.
Curae leves loquuntur, ingentes stupent.

The Harper to his children joined his death,
So be thou justly weary of thy breath.
Amphion, husband of Niobe, son of Jupiter and Antiopa, was brought up among
shepherds, and taught Music by Mercury; he built the walls of Thebes with
stones, drawn thither by playing on his instrument; Afterward outbraving
Apollo and Diana, he was killed.

(1) Amphion the Musician, is son of Jupiter, because that Music is from God:
Or Jupiter is the air, because as Jupiter gave life to Amphion, so does air
unto Music: Amphion was bred among shepherds; for these people leading an idle
life, were invited to invent Music, by singing of birds, whistling of winds,
and running of waters; he was taught by Mercu^y, to show that Eloquence and
Music have equal power upon the affections: Eloquence is a musical speech, and
Music a speechless Eloquence. He built Thebes by Music, that is, Eloquence;
by it rude people are drawn to Religion, Policy and Civility. He out-braving
Apollo and Diana, the Sun and the Moon, shows that Music does as much affect
the soul by the Ear, as light does the Eye. (2) Christ, the heavenly Amphion,
by the harmony of his word, has made us being dead and scattered, to become
living stones toward the building of his Church: Amphion civilized senseless
creatures, but could not charm his own wifes pride: Christ could not cure the
pride of the Jews whom he had married to himself. He piped to them in the
music of the Gospel, but they would not dance unto it by obedience.

Like Pelops sister, hardened stone become,
Or Battus- like, whose tongue did make him dumb.
Niobe sister of Pelops, was turned into Marble. Battus a shepherd, was turned
into a Touchstone by Mercury; because when Mercury had stolen from Apollo
some of the Cattle of Admetus, he gave Battus a Cow to conceal the business,
which he vowed to do; but Mercury having changed his habit, promising Battus a
cow and a bull, he revealed to him where the cattle were, therefore he was so
punished.

(1) Mercury it seems was a very early thief, for Homer reports that he stole
those cattle the first day he was born. Not long after he stole Apollo's
arrows, Vulcans tools, Venus girdle, Joves scepter, when he was yet a child;
nay he had stole his lightning too, but that he was afraid to burn his fingers.
(2) This fiction shows that Eloquence has a bewitching power to deceive; and
that those in whose Horoscope Mercury does predominate, are crafty and
thievish, that hot and dry Planet having such variety of motions. (3) In Battus
see the just reward of Covetousness and Perjury. (4) Perhaps Ovid here meant
and intended the foolish Poet Battus, that redounded in vain and tedious
repetitions, like this shepherd; hence such kind of speech is called Battologia.

585. If Queit thou cast into the open air,
Let Queit thee kill, like Hyacinth the fair.
Hyacinthus was a very beautiful youth, with whom Apollo and Zephyrus were at
once in love. Zephyrus in revenge that the youth inclined to Apollo more then
to him, while he was playing at Queits with Apollo, by a sudden blast turned
the Queit upon his head, and killed him. Apollo grieved at this loss, was
comforted by Tellus, which drank up his blood, and turned it to a flower of his
own name: Some call it Crow-toes.

(1) Flowers are begot by Moisture and Heat, cherished by the Sun. (2) Beauty
is like a flower, soon killed by a sharp blast, as Hyacinthus was. Zephyrus
quasi (...), has its name from bringing life, yet killed this youth; the same
Wind that does cherish animalls and vegetables, does sometimes blast and
destroy, according to the quality assumed from the earth and water, Sandys.
from whence they are exhaled. (3) The Hyacinth expresses Apollo's grief, Ai,
Ai, an afflicted Ingemination charactred in the leaves, into which he
prophesied that Ajax should be converted, as Ai the two first letters of his
name did present, whereof Virgil aenigmatically.

Dic quibus in terris incripti nomina regum
Nascuntur flores; and Phyllida solus habebis.
Tell me where grow the flowers whose leaves enshrine
The names of Kings; and Phillis shall be thine.
(4) The Poets that shadowed under fables, Philosophical and Theological
Instructions, by the love of Gods unto Boys, do express the graciousness of
simplicity and innocence; and like little children, or not at all, we must
enter into celestial habitations.

If thou with nimble arms shall water move,
Let every stream worse then Abydus prove.
Leander a famous youth of Abydus, being in love with Hero, a fair maid of
Sestus, upon the opposite shore, used to swim over to her by night, many times
with good success, but one night a storm arose and drowned him.

(1) Behold in Leander the violence of Love, which all the water in the sea
could scarcely quench, nor roaring waves, nor mingling sea with heaven could
terrify. In Hero see the nature of many women, she was (...); a maiden by day,
a wife by night. Many seem modest and chaste by day, which may be notorious
whores by night; they may delude the eyes of the world, but not his eyes to
whom the night is as clear as the day. Fulgentius observes that Hero
signifies love, from (...), and Leander the dissolution of manhood, from
(...): for Love causes men to undergo any danger, though by night, and makes
them loose and dissolute.

As the Comaedian perished in a brook,
590. So let thy soul the Stygian water choke.
Menander the Comic Poet of Athens, who (as Suidas does report) wrote eighty
Comedies in Greek, swimming in a shallow water was drowned; So was Terence, his
imitator, drowned in the sea.

(1) No soldier with his sharpest weapon, could ever yet repel the foil of
death; no Physician with his strongest antidotes prevent it; no Orator with the
most insinuating rhetoric persuade it; no Poet with the most Nectarian verses
charm it to a pardon, or reprieve: yet though the body of Menander and others
be drowned, their fame will never sink in the lake of oblivion, but live as
long as rivers run into the sea. This perpetual honor, due unto deserving
Poets, was emblemized by their Bays, which grows still green, and by their God
Apollo's face, and hair still young.

Dignum laud virum Musa vetat mori. Hor. Od.

When shipwrack'd thou shall 'scape the boistrous main,
Safely arrived, thou on the land be slain.
Palinurus Pilot of Aenaeas his ship, being in a deep heavy sleep, fell into
the sea, where being for three days tossed, on the fourth he swam to the shore
of Veliae; where the inhabitants in hope of pillage, killed him, and having
robbed him, threw him into the sea again.

(1) Sleep could never seize upon great Jupiter as it did upon Palinurus.
Princes and governors should not slumber in supine negligence; for so they may
drop into an Ocean of danger, and be taken napping. Alectrion, which signifies
a Cock, was once a youth, beloved of Mars, and because he being put to watch
while Mars* lay with Venus, fell asleep, he was converted into that Fowl, with
a crest on his head, representing his Helmet; being mindful of that former
neglect, he does often crow every night. The Swisses going to war, carry with
them a Cock, to mind them both of Vigilance and courage. (2) Souls security is
Satan's opportunity: While the Crocodile sleeps with open mouth, the Indian Rat
shoots himself into his belly, and gnaws his guts asunder. While the husbandman
slept, the envious man sowed tares. Mischief enters at the open gates of
security, but watchful providence preventeth imminent danger. Watch therefore
and pray, lest ye enter into temptation, or temptation into you.

Diana's guard the Tragic Poet slew,
So be thou torn by a watchful dogged crew.
Euripides that famous Greek Tragic Poet, was in great honor with Archelaus
King of Macedonia, he returning one night from supper from a Kings palace, the
Dogs that kept Diana's Temple, put on by his enemy Lysimachus the Kings
servant, tore him in pieces, but afterward that currish Courtier killed
himself. The Grecians and Macedonians strove who should enjoy the bones of
Euripides.

(1) Poets in former ages have been the greatest favorites of the greatest
Kings and Emperors, as Virgil, Horace, and Ovid to Augustus, and Euripides to
Archelaus; And why not now? Sint Mecaenates, non deerunt, Flacce, Marones. Yet
a Welsh Bard has been in a happier and safer condition, in a mountain-cottage,
with whey and oaten cake, then the Greek Poet in a mighty Court, with sweet
meat and sower sauce. But the enemies of Learning, as Lysimachus, have no great
cause to boast, in the end Lysimachus laid dogged hands upon himself, and what
better end can such envious puppies expect, that wrong ingenious Scholars?

595. On the Trinacrian Giants face leap thou,
Where the Sicilian Aetna flames does spue.
Empedocles a Philosopher, and a Poet of Agrigentum, a city in Sicilia, which
is called Trinacria, from the three Promontories near adjacent, secretly
forsaking his companions, in the night leaped into the burning mouth of the
hill Aetna, that he might be accounted among men an immortal God, but his Iron
pantofles cast up by the flame, showed what was become of their Master. Under
Aetna was Tiphoeus buried.

(1) It is a most desperate devilish madness to leap really into the mouth of
Hell, in a fond imaginary hope to be called immortal in the mouth of poor
credulous mortals. But these Impostors have some odd slip or other, that
bewrayes their juggling; as Empedocles shoes discovered him. The Egyptian
Sorcerers, Exodus 8. could imitate Moses in the hardest miracles, but failed in
the lowest, they could not make Lice. The Swan is comely white in body, but his
feet are ugly black. Hypocritical professors appear like Angels of light, yet
the feet of their souls run not the narrow milky way of Gods Commandments, but
the broad black way of the prince of darkness; for they are not soundly shod
with the preparation of the Gospel of peace.

Thinking thee Orpheus, let the wives of Thrace,
With mad nails tear thy limbs place after place.
Orpheus having lost his wife Euridice, determined to marry no other, but lived
a single life, and dissuaded others from marriage, at last he fell to the
devilish use of boys, and therefore the wives of Thrace by scratching killed
him.

(1) A shipwrack'd mariner being once arrived home with his tattered vessel,
hangs up his tacklings in Neptunes Temple, and fears to adventure to sea again;
I could not blame perplexed Socrates, had he been so happy as to have buried
his cursed wise Xantippe, if he had vowed perpetual abstinence. And were I a
widdower, should I marry a worse wife then the former, I should grieve at her
life; if as good, I should grieve at her death. Yet better it is (says the
Apostle) to marry then to burn. Nay, in such an extreme, the Devil with his
fiery darts may kindle an obstinate Votary, as he did Orpheus, with those
filthy men, Romans 1. to leave the natural use of women, and burn in lust of one
toward another.

600. Althea 's son was burned by flames not nigh,
So by a fatal brand live thou, and dye.
Meleager son of Oeneus, King of Calidonia, by Althea, was to live as long as
the stick which the Fates gave his mother, should last. Diana being angry that
Oeneus offered not sacrifice unto her, sent a Bore to devour the Country:
Meleager accompanied with his Uncles Plexippus and Toxus, and fair Atalanta,
killed the Bore, and presented the head unto the Lady, which his Uncles took
from her, and were therefore both slain by Meleager. In revenge of her brothers
blood, his mother cast the fatal stick into the fire, which being burnt out,
Meleager died.

(1) No evil happens to a man but it proceeds either from omission of divine
worship, or actual impiety, Sandys.
and though it seems to proceed from natural causes, as concealed from our
understanding; it is inflicted by supreme appointment. (2) Dishonor to a
mistress is an injury to the Lover implacable and immortal, as Atalanta's to
Meleager: But which the brand in the fire his life was extinguished. This is
thought to have been effected by witchcraft, his image being carved upon the
brand. Pliny speaks of wax^n Images made by Magicians. And Bucanan relates
that Duff, the eig^teenth King of Scotland, p^ned away with perpetual sweat;
but when a witch that was ^o^^d rosting the Kings Image in wax at a ^oft fire,
was taken and executed, and the Image broken, the King recovered in a moment.
From the crafts and assaults of the Devil, good Lord deliver us.

Or as the Phasian chaplet burnt the spouse,
With her, her father, and her fathers house.
Medea of Colchos (by which place the river Phasis runs) drawn through the
air by her Dragons, arrived at Corinth, where her husband Jason was married to
Creusa daughter of King C^eon, whence being condemned to banishment, she
obtained a days respite; in the interim, she sends a crown and robe to Creusa,
which being put on, set her on fire, with her father that came to rescue her,
and at last the whole house.

(1) All creatures and plants do increase to a period, and then do incline and
decay, except the Crocodile, Dal. Aph.
which grows bigger and bigger to her death. All perturbations of mind have
their intentions and remissions, except malicious revenge, chiefly of alienated
love; the longer it lasts, the stronger it waxes, as we may see by Medea.
(2) That wherewith she anointed the garment sent to Creusa, is by Plutarch
called Naptha, which is a slimie chalk engendered among the rocks in Parthia;
between this chalk and the fire is so great sympathy, that it draws the fire
unto it, as the lodestone does iron, and is incensed with the natural heat of
the body, enraged rather then subdued by water. Alexander for sport sake,
caused his boys garment to be anointed with it, which being set on fire, burned
him to death, though all means possible was used to quench it, and preserve the
youth.

As blood like poison Hercules limbs did fill,
So let rank poison all thy vitals kill.
Hercules swom over the river Evenus, and trusted the half-horse Nessus, to
carry over his wife Dejanira, but the perfidious Centaure attempting mean time
on the bank to ravish her, was prevented by a mortal wound from Hercules arrow;
Dying Nessus persuaded her to give Hercules a garment dipped in his blood, saying
it would revive her husbands decayed affection; Hercules wearing it, broyls
with extreme heat, and miserably dies.

(1) Nessus was one of those that fled from the battle between the Centaures
and the Lapithits, whom Hercules helped to subdue, yet contrary to humane
policy, Hercules gives credit to a reconciled enemy. But credulity proceeds
from a man's own Integrity, a vice more honest then safe. Thus Dejanira, like a
woman that is either too affectionate, or too jealous, acc^pts the gift, not
considering that it came from an enemy, which ever tends to mischief. More
circumspect was the Trojan, Timeo Danaos and dona ferentes. The Greeks though
bringing gifts I fear. Thus noble and worthy Heroes have been ruined by too
much confidence in perfidious cowards.

605. And as his heir revenged Pentheus son
Lycurgus, with like dart be thou undone.
Lycurgus son of Pentheus, that was son of Dryas, because he cut down the vines
in Thracia, was infuriated by Bacchus Priests, and so cut his own shins, Buthes
(or Bethes) son of Lycurgus, in his fathers revenge, slew them.

(1) It is too much like Bacchus Priests to be drunk alone, but to provoke
others, does aggravate the offense. Thus persons sick of the plague take
delight to infect others. And as it was lawful in former times to kill a
pestilent person, that presumed to go abroad upon that design; so was it
natural in Butes, the son, to destroy the pestiferous Priests that did
intoxicate his father to his ruin.

As Milo stout, to cleave an Oak assay,
But fail to pluck thy fastened hand away.
Milo of Crotonia, a man of incomparable strength, carried an Ox on his back
over the Olympian stage in one breath, then knocked him in the head with his
fist, and in one day eat him every bit; being too confident of his strength, he
took upon him to pluck out the wedges that the clevers had stuck fast in an
oak, which he did perform, but the gaping oak suddenly returned to its place,
and held his hands so fast that he could not pluck them out, so he became a
prey to the ravenous wolves.

(1) As it is a sorry horse that will not carry his own provender; so that man
is worse then a beast that will in one day put so much in his belly as he can
carry on his back; such an one is fitter to be h^nged then kept, for he robs
many an honest man of his v^ctuals. (2) Attempt nothing but what may be
accomplished with dexterity and honor. He is neither a wise nor a valiant
soldier that desperately adventures upon a design before he is sure of a safe
retreat, otherwise he may become a prey to his wolf-like enemy.

Be thou as Icarus, by thy own gift harmed,
610. A drunken rabble fall upon thee armed;
As his kind daughter for her fathers death,
Knit to thy throat a cord, and stop thy breath.
Icarius (not Icarus) son of Oebalus, and father of E^igon^, was a guest to
Bacchus, who gave him a Borachio of wine, and bad him communicate it to others.
He gave it to certain shepherds in his return to Attica, who immoderately
drinking thereof, fell on the earth, and imagining that Icarius had poisoned
them, with their staves they killed him. His Dog Nerea, by running before and
howling, showed Erigone the place where her father lay unburied, who after she
had interred him, hanged her self; but Jupiter changed them both into a
constellation, calling Erigone, Virgo, one of the six Northern signs, and her
father Boots; between whose legs shines the eminent Arcturus, which in revenge
of his murder, rises in tempests. But Icarius his Dog, that died at his
hanging Mistress feet, was called Astricion, by us the Dog star; his
malignancy, as they feign, proceeding from the former occasion, causing burning
fevers, frenzies, and other infections, whose reign determines with the rising
of Arcturus, the season then suffering an alteration.

(1) Wine comforts the heart, strengthens the body, cherishes the spirits, and
helps the stomach, if used with moderation: there is no such poison as wine,
nor the cause of more mischief, both in the body Politic and Natural. (2) See
in Erigone the preposterous passion of a Woman. We should be patient at the
loss of friends, not like those that be void of hope. (3) The fidelity and
thankfulness of this Dog Nerea, and many other I have read of, may condemn the
treachery and ingratitude from man to man. Icarius was slain for his own
courtesies. And who is worse rewarded then he that does most good to the
Commonwealth?

Be famished, shut up in a room, as he,
To whom his mother did his pain decree.
Euristhenes after an overthrow at war, returning home, was so hated among the
people, that his own mother shut him up in a chamber, and there famished him to
death. Alciat, and many others do interpret this of Pausanias, Captain of the
Lacedaemonians, who for treason was shut up in the Temple of Minerva by the
Edict of the Ephori, and his own mother put the first stone to fasten the door.

(1) The planks of ancient ships were made of Pine Tree, because heavy weight
caused them not to bend down, but to rise upwards; such is the undaunted heart
of a magnanimous soldier; therefore victorious Generals riding home in
triumph, wore a Pine branch in their Helmets, and were honored of all men,
alive and dead. But a timorous Coward not only dishonours himself and his
Country, but is rendered odious even to his own ingenuous parents that begat
him. (2) Let us fight the good fight of faith, and resist to blood: so shall we
be more then conquerours, and receive the Crown of Glory.

615. Minerva's Temple do thou so annoy,
As he that turned his course away from Troy.
Ajax Oileus coming out of his way, in his return from Toy, deflowred Cassandra
in the Temple of Pallas, so Jupiter killed him with a thunderbolt.

(1) Heathen Gods suffered not the profaners of their Idolatrous Temples to
escape unpunished; how much less will our true and jealous God the polluters of
that Sanctuary, wherein his Name is called upon* Christ whipped out of the Jewish
material Temple the profaners of it, so let us whip sin out of our spiritual
temple, the soul. Cast back an eye on some foregoing ages, and you will find
that sacrilegious persons did not long enjoy themselves. Vix gaudet tertius
haeres.

With Nauplias suffer death for no desert,
And not escape it, though thou guiltless art.
Palamedes son of Nauplus, King of Eubaea, because he discovered Ulysses, and
forced him to come with other Grecians to the siege of Troy, was ever envied by
him; for revenge Ulysses in the leager caused a sum of gold to be hid in the
Tent of Palamedes, and counterfeited Letters from Priamus King of Troy, to
Palamedes, containing thanks for betraying the Grecians at his request,
intimating that he had sent him so much gold for his pains and care: Hereupon
Palamedes is accused of treason by Ulysses, the gold is found in his Tent, he
is condemned and stoned.

(1) Poison is of such a force that it corrupts both blood and spirit,
besieging, seizing and infecting the heart with its venomous contagion, quite
altering the complexion and disposition of the man that drinks it: So the
pestiferous desire of revenge, though it seizes on a prudent mind, and a mild,
and a mansuete disposition, it is of such a forcible operation, that it not
only alters man's nature, but makes men unnatural; that truth is plainly
proved by the example of Ulysses. (2) It is the only valor in a Christian to
remit an injury, and it is right noble, that we might hurt, and will not. B.
Hall.
Let us so remit wrongs, that we encourage not others to offer them, and so
retain them, that we induce not God to retain ours to him.

As Isis Priest killed Ethalus, his guest,
620. Whose service angered Io does detest.
Io, daughter of the river Inachus, was beloved of Jupiter, which that Juno
might not suspect, he turned her into a Cow, which Juno begs and delivers to
hundred-eyed Argus to be kept, him Mercury kills: Juno sends a breeze which
made Io run mad up and down the world, till she came to Egypt, where she
recovers her former shape, and being called Isis, she was married to Osyris:
being dead she was deified and honored with a Temple, Priests and Sacrifice.
One of her Priests had killed Ethalus whom he entertained as a guest: the
people to appease the Goddess being offended with the fact, deposed him out of
his Priesthood, and decreed, that neither he nor any of his kindred should ever
be admitted to that office.

(1) Io is feigned to be the daughter of a river, because her father Inachus,
the first that reigned in Argos, was accidentally drowned in Carmanor, which
after bare his name. Diodorus writes, that Io was a most beautiful woman, and
married to Osyris, and that he was called Jupiter, and she Isis; thus Jupiter
loved Isis: Certainly the Egyptians worshipped Osyris under the shape of an Ox,
and why not Isis in the form of a Cow? for she taught them husbandry and many
arts. Nor do some of the learned doubt, but that the Israelites long sojourning
in Egypt, brought thence their superstition of the golden calf, made after two
by Jeroboam, Sandys.
that lived an exile in that country. So much for History. But, Naturally,
Jupiter lay with Io, that is, the aetheriall heat draws up vapors from the
earth perpetually, and is delivered to Argus, that is, the starry heaven, Not.
Com.
to be kept. Morally thus. Io was turned to a Cow, and delivered to Argus: so
many by Gods permission degenerate into beastly affections, whereby they are
made slaves to wealth, and are subject to watching and continual cares, like
Argus his eyes.

Or as Melanthius son that guilty lay
In dark, by light his mother did bewray:
So let thy body he with weapons cut,
And of all friendly succor destitute.
Codrus son of Melanthius (not the King nor the Poet) having killed his father,
hid himself; his mother alone knowing where he lay, with a candle found him
out, and delivered him to the Athenians to suffer death.

(1) That famous Greek Lawgiver being asked why among other Laws he made none
against him that killed his father; gave this worthy answer; I thought no man
could be so wicked. Wickedness it is of a deep die, to kill a natural father,
but it was a crime in grain for Ravilliack to kill his civil father, That is
but a private, This a public person, and a common parent: The blood of a
murdered st^anger will cry aloud to heaven for vengeance, of a brother louder,
but of a father louder yet. If Cain shall be avenged seven times, Lamech shall
be avenged seven times seven, Genesis 4.24.

Such as the desperate Trojan that did vow
To steal Achilles horses, rest have thou.
Dolon, a nimble-footed soldier of Troy, for a sum of money, promised to fetch
away two of Achilles horses, but he was prevented by Ulysses and Diomedes, by
whom he was all night examined concerning the affairs of Troy, and in the
morning killed.

(1) Who can blame Dolon, a poor Pedee, for adventuring his life for Gold? What
else, next to honor, is the highest aim of the chiefest soldier? The first
was the happiest of all ages, it was golden, not from money but manners; for
then was no gold nor silver known, no war nor soldier used. This last and
worst of Ages, though it be called the Iron age, because so much arms and
weapons are made, it may indeed more properly be called the golden age, for
never was gold in more esteem.

Aurea nunc vere sunt secula, plurimus auro
Venit honos, auro conciliatur Amor.
Now is the golden age indeed, for gold
Honor is bought, and love it self is sold.
Such sleep as Rhesus and his company,
May thou enjoy the night before thou die.
Rhesus King of Thracia had horses of whom it was destined, that if they drank
of the river Xanthus, and tasted of the pastures of Troy, that Troy should not
be taken (such was the fond conceit of the besieged) he approached very nigh
unto his fatal steeds, but was taken by night of Ulysses, and both he and his
company slain.

(1) Whatsoever Providence has decreed concerning person or Nation cannot be
avoided. All humane policy, plots, and stratagems crossing this, are but labor
in vain; sublunary and secundary causes are but subordinate instruments. The
divine power is the first mover and director of all. (2) Man may purpose, God
must dispose. But if God be for us who can be against us? (...).

If God thee aid, no force can thee assail:
If God helps not, no labor can prevail.
Or with Rutilian Rhamnes whom the son
630. Of Hyrtacus slew, and his companion.
Rhamnes a King and Southsayer, an auxiliary of Turnus, being a sleep in his
Tent with many soldiers, was taken napping, and slain by Nysus son of
Hyrtacus, and his companion Euryalus.

(1) Augustus Caesar would gladly have bought that man's pillow whereon he could
sleep, being in debt, not fearing a Catch-poll at the door to apprehend him.
Desperate is the condition of that Mariner that falls asleep on the top of a
mast-pole; and who will pity that soldiers death, that s^orts in his tent,
not dreaming that the enemy is still watching to surprise him? (2) Let us keep
a continual guard over our souls. Be sober and watch, for your enemy the Devil
walks about, like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devour, 1 Pet. 5.8.

As Clysias son hemmed in with stifling fire,
Members half burned bring to the Stygian mire.
Alcibiades an Athenian, could frame himself to all manners, customs, and
fashions. Plutarch in his life, bestows upon him this character. He could more
easily transform himself to all manner of shapes, then a Chamelion; so that all
people did wonder that in one man could be so diverse natures. At the last by
the means of Lysander, he was banished into Phrygia, whither Pharnabazus sent
executioners to kill him: They set the house on fire, which Alcibiades espying,
ran through the fire somewhat sing^d; the Murderers shot him with darts, and
killed him.

(1) The Chamelion is a small beast, much like a Frog or a Toad; it can change
it self to all colors but white, so can Hypocrites to any thing but honesty.
The Polypus in Lucian, is a small kind of fish, that can turn it self to the
color of any rock she swim^ to. So Timists and Hypocrites change their
opinion, and swim with the tide like Alcibiades, to day a^ holy as a Monk, to
morrow as wicked as a Devil: like Materia prima, omaium formarum capax; apt to
entertain any form: Omnium horarum homo; turned up and down, like, and as often
as an hourglass. But such All-no-noth^ngs, though they may not, perhaps, with
Alcibiades, suffer the fire and sword here, must expect their portion among
their brother-hypocrites in the lake hereafter.

As Rhemus that upon th'unfinish'd wall
Presumed to leap, thy pate rude weapons mall.
When Rome was building, Romulus the Founder and Namer of the City, made an
Edict, that upon pain of death none should climb the walls, before they were
finished: his brother Rhemus, not regarding the Kings command, ascended, but
was killed for his pains by the workmen.

(1) Fortune and Justice are both painted blind; the one bestows without
respect of persons, so should the other punish, not conniving at friends, or a
brother as dear as Rhemus. Qui non vetat peccare cum potest, jubet. Sen. Trag.
An ill executioner of Laws is worse in a State, then a great breaker of them.
Therefore Zaleucus, when his own son for Adultery should according to Law, have
lost both his eyes, he plucked out one of his own eyes first, and then one of
his sons; thus showing himself a tender father, not only to his child, but
country, in preserving the Laws entire.

635. Lastly among the Sauromatick fry,
And darting Getes, here may thou live and die.
Sarmates are fierce and cruel people, inhabiting near the Euxin Sea, in the
utmost part of Scythia; they feed upon horseflesh, and man's flesh, and are
therefore called Anthropophagi; by reason of the extreme cold of that Climat
they lie in Caves under ground* they fight with darts, never knowing p^^ce. The
Greeks call them Sauromates from (...), that is a L^zard, and (...) an Eye.

G^es are a people in Europe, near Scythia, sometimes called Daci, or D^vi:
therefore slaves among the Athenians were named Davi, or Ge^ae. To this cold
and comfortless nook of the world was most unseasonably transplanted the
choicest flower of Poetry, our most ingenious author Ovid.

(1) This one Distick is the acutest, and smartest in all this little and
learned Poem: for it is not only most of all Satirical, but succinctly
Rhetorical. Ovid after many grievous miseries and mischiefs imprecated against
Ibis, sums up all particulars in this one Total, and comprehends all curses
that he has or could repeat, in this brief Corollary (for worse he thought he
could not invent) To live and die in that accursed coas^ where he was banished.
And Oratorically herein he does closely intimate to Augustus, that of all the
punishments he could possibly inflict upon the most grievous offender, none
could be more grievous then his banishment into Scythia.

These lines in brief, and in post-hast I wrote,
That thou might not complain I thee forgot.
(1) Surely he must have a memory brittler then Messala Corvinus, that forgot
his own name, and a judgment shallower then a Baeotian, that having thoroughly
perused this Book, will imagine that Ovid had forgotten Ibis.

My votes are few, Gods add unto the score,
640. And multiply thy tortures more and more.
More shall thou read, which thy right name shall hit,
And in such feet as bloody wars be writ.
FINIS.
