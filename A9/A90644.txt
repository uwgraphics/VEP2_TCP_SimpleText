To the Reader.
WHosoever is versed in the knowledge of Merchandising, specially in the
mystery of Foreign Trade, must confess what extraordinary advantages accrue
to this Kingdom by Commerce with Spain, and the Dominions annexed to that
Crown, as well for the Exportation of our own Manufactures and Commodities,
as for the importation of theirs, especially that of Treasure, else how could
our Mint find matter enough to work upon? Nor is ours alone, but most of the
Mints of Europ beholden to the Mines of Mexico and Peru; Nor Christian Mints
only, but the Turk makes his aspers, the Russe makes his Rubbles of Spanish
Rialls, Insomuch that one may say, the Coin of Spain is more Catholic then
her King. And as our trade and amity with Spain is gainful, so is it very
ancient; For the Spaniards to this day respect the English, as much as any
other foreign Nation, and there are many inducements thereunto. The Chronicle
tell us how our Black Prince restored one of their Kings to his Crown; the
Alliance 'twixt the Duke of Lancaster and Portugal, is yet fresh amongst them;
Some of our Kings sent them Auxiliaries against the Moors, besides diverse
other Alliances; And the story tells us what excellent Queens the Infanta's of
Spain have proved with us. Add hereunto our ancient and famous League with the
House of Burgundy, whereof this King is the chiefest branch; All these are
obligations for Spain to esteem us, and us them interchangeably, which we did,
till the difference of Religion happened, and our assisting the Hollanders,
with the Invasion intended in the year 1588. And though we have been at
distance with the Spaniard ever since, yet he seems to retain still the
National esteem he had always of us; It being one of his maine maxims of
policy; Con todo el mundo guerra, y paz con Ingalatierra; War with all the
world, and peace with England.

The English Merchants have obtained from time to time diverse privileges in
the King of Spaines Dominions which have been but loosely observed; This
following Declaration or Royal grant, is not only a confirmation, but an
enlargement of those Privileges, for hereby they are exempted from all oaths
and questions touching their Religion, which before they were subject unto in
some cases. Their Corn is not to be anticipated or taken away from them by any
Officer for supply of the Kings Armies or Magazins, till they have made their
market; They shall not be molested, much less imprisoned for any putrified or
ill conditioned fish, but it must be only thrown oreboard. Their books of
Accounts are not to be seized upon, or meddled with by any Officer; There shall
be no rate as heretofore imposed upon their fish, or any preemption forced upon
them, but they shall be left free to set their own prices. And lastly, they
are permitted to choose and nominate a Judge to be their Conservator, who shall
have power to determine all suites and differences 'twixt them and any other,
so that they shall not need hereafter to be tossed from one Court to another,
but make their address only to their own Judge, whom they may change when
they please, and there is no appeal from him to any other Court, unless it be
to the High Counsel of State. Besides, they have privilege now to search for
any old Record that may concern their immunities, which before they could not.

And if our Merchants trading into Spain, and there resident, were so careful
as they ought to be, they would make better use of that Kings indulgence
toward them; for those of Sivill, had of late a Royal grant to purchase and
enclose a piece of ground, for a Cymitrey or burial place, but they slighting
this favor of grace, immodestly expose their dead bodies unto the scorn and
outrage of the rude multitude, but I hope, and heartily wish, That the
propensitie of that King to do our Nation good, may encourage those whom it
may concern to be as provident to obtain some immunities for the good of
their souls and bodies, as for their estates.

These Compliances of the Spaniard with the English Nation, I thought expedient
to publish unto the world, that we by way of civil correspondence should
respect the Merchants and Subjects of that Crown accordingly.

Your loving Friend, I. B.

The Copy of a Patent, containing several gracious Privileges lately granted
by the High and Mighty Philip the Fourth, King of Spain, etc.
DOn Philip by the grace of God, King of Castile, Leon, Aragon, the two
Sicilies, Jerusalem, Portugal, Navarre, Granado, Toledo, Valencia, Galisia,
Maliorca, Sivill, Sardonia, Cordova, Corsega, Murica, Iaen, the Algarues,
Algesira Gibraltar, the Islands of the Canaries, the East and West Indies,
Islands and firm Land of the Ocean Sea, Archduke of Austria, Duke of
Burgundy, Brabant and Milan, Earl of Haspurg, Handers, Tiroll and Barselona,
Lord of Biscay and Molina, etc,

Whereas on the behalf of you Richard Anthony, Consul of the English Nation,
for your self, and in the name of the Subjects of the King of Great Britain,
it has been showed unto me, that by virtue of the peace, which is concluded in
this and that Realm, you do reside and trade in Andalusia, and specially in
the Cities of Sivill, St. Lucar. Cadiz, and Malaga, Desiring me to be pleased
to confirm unto you the Privileges, exemptions and faculties, which do belong
unto you, as well by the Articles of the said Peace, as by the confirmations
thereof, and other favors and graces, which my Lord and Father of Glorious
memory, did grant unto you, and all such others, which have been given you by
the Crowns of my Realms of Castile and Portugal, and to command, that they
may be in, and for all things observed and accomplished unto you, without any
limitation; And for fuller assurance to grant them anew unto you, with the
qualities, amplitudes, conditions, and declarations, which shall be most
convenient for you, and to set penalties upon such as shall contradict, and not
observe them unto you. And to the end it may be known, what they are, to grant
them Copies thereof, or of that which my favor shall be; And I taking the
premises into consideration, and because for the occasions which I have for my
wars, you have offered to serve me, with two thousand and five hundred
Duccats of silver, to be paid one thousand ready money, and the remaining one
thousand and five hundred in the month of April, of this year (whereof the
Licenciate Francis Moreno, with in reversion of Don Anthony de Campo Redondo y
Rio, Knight of the order of Santiago, one of my Council and Chamber, and of
the Treasury, in your name, and by virtue of your power did acknowledge a
writing of obligation in form before John Cortez de la Cruz, my Notary) I do
hold it for good; And by these presents of my own motion and certain knowledge,
and Royal and absolute power, which I in this behalf will make use of, and do
use as an absolute King and Lord, not acknowledging any superior in matters
Temporal, do confirm and approve the Privileges, exemptions and faculties,
which do belong unto you, as well by the Articles of the said peace, as by the
confirmation thereof, and also the other favors and graces, which my Lord and
Father did grant unto you, and others whatsoever which have been given, by my
Crowns of Castile and Portugal unto the said Subjects, in and for all things,
as therein, and every thing and part thereof is specified, contained and
declared, to the end they may be firm, stable, and of value, and be observed,
kept, and accomplished unto you. For my deliberate intent and will is, that all
those of the said Nation, shall enjoy thereof, without any limitation, in such
manner, that, during the time the said Englishmen shall reside in Andalusia,
neither you, nor they, may be charged with any Office nor public charge, nor
Counsel, Tutorship, Curatorship, Receivers, or Treasurers, although they be of
Customs and Millions, or other Services which concern my Royal Treasury; And
much less they may demand of you any Loans or Donations, or take from you any
rights, or your rents, horses, or slaves. And to do you the more favor or
grace, according to that which is agreed by the said Peace, I do will and
promise, that you shall and may deal and trade freely, and sell your
Merchandises and Fruits, and buy those of my Realms, and carry them forth,
observing that which is ordained and commanded by the Laws and Statutes, which
make mention thereof; and paying to my Royal Treasury the Duties or Customs
which ought to be paid; Prohibiting, as I do prohibit and command, not to take
from you by force, any Merchandises, Wheat nor Barley, although it be for the
making ready, or furnishing of my Armies, Fleets, or Gallions, nor for
purveyors or Stewards, and the privileges are to be concerning the Wheat and
Barley, according to the Tax, and concerning the other things and Merchandises,
as you shall conclude and agree, but they may not take them out of your
possession, until they shall have paid for them, unless for the same there be
leave given, that they do not molest or trouble you. And forasmuch as many of
you do treat to bring into the Ports of Andalusia, the City of Sivill, and
other places, great quantity of Newfoundland fish, and other sorts of dry and
salted fish, because they are victuals which are very necessary, and that you
have been, and are put to great charges, and are much troubled; I do will and
command, to be kept, the Ordinance of the City of Sivill, whereby it is
ordained, that those which come in with dry or salted Fish, there shall not be
any price or rate set upon them, but they shall be permitted to sell at such a
price as they shall think good, and it shall not be necessary to manifest them
any more, then unto my Officers which receive my Royal rents, and if the ships
wherein the said Fish is brought be great ships, that they cannot go up the
River, and that the same be put into Barks or Lighters, the ludge of the
Admiralty, nor any other person, may not put any Weighters or keepers into the
Barks or Lighters, at the charge of the owners of them.

And I do also command, that if the said Fish shall appear to be rotten, and
that it cannot be spent, that it be burnt, or thrown into the Sea, and that for
this cause, there shall not be any cause or action commenced against the owners
thereof, or persons which shall sell it, nor they shall not be imprisoned nor
informed against. And forasmuch as the Administrator of the Customs and
others, of diverse duties which are received for the Fruits and Merchandises, do
use when any body does inform, to have the person imprisoned, which shows
himself to be party, whereby happens to the men of Trade, great discredit,
charges, and vexations. My will is, and I do command, that in the said
Informations there shall be only proceeded against the Merchandises, and not
against the persons, but they shall be permitted (as I do permit them) to
make, and they shall make their defenses in the said vexations. And forasmuch
also as according to an Article of the said Peace, which makes mention of
matter in Religion, notwithstanding that in some suites, they should declare
whether they be Roman Catholics or not, excusing themselves to give faith to
the oaths which they take, as parties or as witnesses.

I do also command, that concerning this matter, there be not done, nor there
shall not be done any thing with those which are borne in the said Realm, but
only, that the said Condition be kept, and accomplished, and that no such
questions be put unto them, giving, unto the Oaths which they shall take in
Judgment Court, and without, the same faith and credit, which should be given
in case they were Spaniards, and herein you shall not receive any trouble or
molestation, nor there shall not be any grievance done unto you; And whereas
for the Justification of some Causes, the Judges and Justices do pretend, that
the Merchants of the said Nation, should exhibit the Books of their
Contractations or dealings, and are for this matter troubled and molested, I
do will and Command, that the Books of the Merchants of the said Nation,
shall not be taken out of their hands for any cause whatsoever, but they shall
keep and show them in their houses, to take out the parcel which shall be
appointed, and others shall not be demanded of them, nor there shall not be any
other papers taken from them, upon penalty, that he which shall do
here-against, shall be punished according to law.

And forasmuch as the Merchants do dispatch the Merchandise from the
Custom House of the said City of Sivill of all duties; and because they are
many, do make up a sheet, which is subscribed and signed by all the officers,
and remains in the hand of the Alcayde of the Custom House, for that by
virtue thereof, the Merchandises are permitted to go forth, which are in
Fardells, Packs, Trunks, and Cases, and afterward when they have taken them
forth, and put them into their Houses, and Warehouses, the chief keeper of the
Customhouse, and the Officers of the half per cent, do visit the houses and
the goods, troubling and molesting them, demanding of them the disparches, it
seeming unto them, that they may detain them, because they left the dispatches
in the hands of the said Alcayde of the Customehouse, I do prohibit and
command, that the houses of the said Merchants, shall not be visited, nor the
dispatches shall not, nor may not be demanded of them, in regard they have them
not in their hands, and this is to be understood, and is understood, of houses
which are within the walls of the said City, And to the end it may be known to
you, which are of the said English Nation, there is to be delivered unto you
Copies of the said Privileges and exemptions, which do concern you, and
which were granted unto you, as well by the Articles of the peace, as in any
other manner, And for execution and accomplishment of all the Premises, I do
command those of my Counsel, and those of my Counsels, Assemblies, and
Tribunalls of my Court, and the Presidents and Judges of my Audiences,
Alcaldes, and Officers of my House, and Court, and Chanceries, and the Regent
and ludge of the Court of Degrees of the City of Sivill, and chief Alcaldes of
the Precincts thereof, and all the Corrigedors, Assistants, and Governors,
chief Justices, and Ordinaries, as well in the said Cities of Sivil, Cadiz,
Malaga, and St. Lucar de Barameda, as of all other Cities, Towns, and places
of these my Realms and Dominions, and all other Judges and Justices
whatsoever, of what quality or condition soever they may be, whom principally
or incedentally may concern in any manner the accomplishment or performance of
that which is contained in this Patent, that presently so soon as they shall
be, by virtue thereof, required, or the Copy thereof signed by a Notary
public, that there be thereunto given, as much faith as unto the original,
and that every one in the place, where it shall concern him, do observe and
accomplish; and cause the same to be observed, accomplished and executed, in
and for all things as therein is contained, and they shall not in all, or in
part, put upon you any impediments, nor any other difficulties or doubt, nor
do any thing against the tenor and form thereof, nor consent or give way,
that it be interpreted, limited or suspended in all, or in part, or that to the
contrary be given any Sedulas provisions or other dispatches, but for
observation thereof, in the place which shall concern every one, they shall
give order and ordain, to deliver unto you those which shall be necessary; And
for more firmness or validity of the favor or grace, which by this my Patent
I do grant you, and that at all times this favor may be certain and sure
unto you, you are to keep or have a Judge Conservator in Andalusia, especially
in the said Cities of Sivill, Malaga, Cadiz, and St. Lucar de Barameda, unto
whom I am to give sufficient Commission, for the keeping and accomplishing of
the said Privileges, Liberties, and exemptions, who shall constrain and compel
all and whatsoever, persons, of what sort or quality they may be, that shall
concern the said Nation, as well those which shall be Defendants, accused, as
those which shall be Plaintiffs, although the persons which shall accuse them,
and which shall be accused by them, have private Judges, as well by consent as
agreement, which they may have made by pre-eminence or privilege, which they
hold, to the end the said Judge Conservator, may only take knowledge privately
of the said Causes, and not any other Judge or tribunal, although it be by way
of Excess, or notorious Justice, or in any other manner or form. Which Judge
Conservator is now Doctor Don Francisco de Vergara, Judge of my Court de los
Grados of the City of Sivill, the time that he shall assist therein, and in his
absence the Licenciate Don Francisco de Medrano, Judge of the same Court, who
for the suites which shall be commenced in the said Cities of Cadiz, Malaga,
and St. Lucar, is to Subdelegate his Conservatorship, in the person which by
the said Nation shall be propounded or named, that he may affect the same, to
the conclusion, and they shall be referred unto him, to be determined, and of
that which he shall determine; the appeal is to be made to my Council, and
not to any other Court.

And forasmuch as my will is, that every one in his time, shall have primative
Commission and Jurisdiction, to protect and defend you, concerning all the
contents of this my Patent, that all the same may be kept and accomplished in
the form which I do offer the same unto you, I have found good to charge, as
by these presents I do charge them, with the protection, and defense hereof,
and I do command them, to see or peruse this my Patent, and the qualities,
conditions, preheminences, and amplifications therein contained, and to cause
all the same to be kept, accomplished and executed, in such form and manner,
and according as therein is contained and declared, without consenting, or
giving way, that in all or in part, there be made unto you any doubt or
difficulty, and before the said Don Franciscode Vergara, or in his absence
before the said Don Francis de Medrano (and not before any other Judge)
privately in the First instance, are to pass, and be followed all the causes
and suites, which concerning the Premises, or any thing or part thereof shall
be moved and caused, and the execution and punishment of those which shall not
be obedient; For my will is, that the knowledge and determination of all the
contents in this my Patent, is in all things privately to concern, and shall
concern them; proceeding in all things against those which shall be culpable,
and executing for the same, the penalties which are mentioned by Law, reserving
as I do reserve, the appellations which shall be put in upon their Acts and
Sentences, to my Council, and not any other Court, without that any of my
other Counsels, Tribunalls, Courts, Chanceries, or any other Judges or
Justices of my Realms or Dominions, of whatsoever quality they be, may meddle,
or shall meddle therewith, or in the use or exercise of the Jurisdiction
privative in the said first instance, which by this my Patent I do grant unto
them, by way of excess appellation or any other recourse or manner, the which
and every of them, I do inhibit and hold for inhibited the knowledge thereof
and do declare them for incompetent Judges thereof, for which and every thing,
and part thereof, I do give them the most sufficient power, and most ample
Commission, which according to Law is required and necessary, with the
incidences and dependencies annexities, and after them the said English nation
of the said city of Sivill, may name in the said Commission, one of the Judges
of the said Audience, which the said Nation shall choose; And I do command the
President and those of my Counsel of the Chamber, that presenting before them
their nomination (the case happening) to make void the said Commission, by
promotion or vacation of the said Don Francis de Vergara, and Don Francis de
Medrano, or to dispatch it, in any other manner, by ordinary to him that shall
be therein nominated, in the form according, and as by this my Patent is
declared; And that it may be the better accomplished, I do from this time give
them power and authority, that they may subdeligate, and they shall subdeligate
this Commission for the business and suites, which shall be offered in the
said Cities of Cadiz Malaga, and St. Lucar de Barameda, in the person which by
you shall be propounded unto them, that they may substantiate them for a
conclusion, and remit the Suites and Causes, unto them to be determined, in
such manner, as they shall find good and convenient, for the security of that
which is contained in this my Patent; And I do charge the most Excellent
Prince, Don Balthazar Charles, my most dear, and most beloved Son, and do
command the Infants, Prelates, Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Richmen, Commanders,
and under-Commanders, Governors of Castles, Counsel, Presidents Plains, and
those of my Counsel, Presidents and Judges of my Courts, Alcaydes, and
Officers of my House, Court and Chanceries, and all the Corigidors, Assistants,
Governors, Alcaldes, Mayors, and Ordinaries, and whatsoever Judges and
Justices of these my Realms and Dominions, to observe and accomplish, and
cause to be observed and accompished, this my Patent, and the favor or grace
