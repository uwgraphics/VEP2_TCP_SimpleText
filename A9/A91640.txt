A REMONSTRANCE Showing the occasion of the ARMING of the County of KENT.
BEing reduced to this Choice, whether to deliver up our Lives and Li^erties
together, or to dye free; We are resolved to act the last Scene of this Tragedy
with our Swords in our hands. Which we shall sooner turn upon our own hearts,
then upon the Public Peace. By what necessities exasperated to this Resolve,
let the World determine. And understand that a Petition consonant to Religion
and Honor (if the Parliament may be judge) is by some persons, neither
warranted by any Authority from the two Houses, nor pretending to it; upon
their own score, audaciously affronted. The Petitioners menaced and persecuted
into this extremity, by spirits so implacably distempered, that Sir Anthony
Weldon vowed he would not cross the Street of Rochester to save one soul that
subscribed the Petition. And it was a Proposition of Baals, to hang two of the
Petitioners in every Parish. If this be not enough to admonish others, let it
suffice that it awakens us, into a just sense and scorn of these Indignities.
We have lost all with Patience, and if at last, it be accounted a Crime to
beg, we shall prefer to perish.

WE do solemnly and Religiously oblige our selves, with our Lives and
Fortunes, to oppose effectually* what Person or Persons soever shall presume to
interrupt us in the just and Legal presentment of our humble desires to the
two Houses of Parliament; and to the utmost of our endeavors to save
harmless, and protect each the other in a privilege so undoubtedly our own,
and so not only adjudged, but practiced and encouraged by this present
Parliament. And further, in Case any single person shall be for this Engagement
prosecuted, All of us to rise as one Man to the rescue. This, so help us God,
as we shall respectively perform and resolutely.
