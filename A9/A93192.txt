A Short and True State of the Case, relating to the Election for the Borough
of Corffe Castle, in the Isle of Purbeck, and County of Dorset, which was on
the 4th of August, School.
William Culliford and Edward Clauell Esqs; stood against John Banks and
Richard Fownes Esqs;
Mr Culliford and Mr Banks Were Returned, and are the Sitting Members. Mr
Clauell and Mr Fownes are the Petitioners.
BY the Mayors Poll (who as chief Magistrate is Judge of the Election) after
the strictest Scrutiny imaginable, and a good deal of partiality showed by the
Mayor in favor of Mr Banks and Mr Fownes, Mr Culliford had 85 Votes, Mr
Banks 70 Votes; Mr Clauell (who Petitions against Mr Banks) 63 Votes, and Mr
Fownes (who Petitions against Mr Culliford) but 52 Votes, whereupon the Mayor
proclaimed Mr Culliford and Mr Banks duly Elected.

Mr Fownes in his Petition allows the Majority to be on Mr Culliford's side
upon the Poll; But says that Mr Culliford, by Treating, and several indirect
Practices, at and before the Election, did procure several Votes to his
prejudice; otherwise he had been Chosen and Returned; alleging he can prove
the same.

Mr Culliford denies the fact absolutely, and believes that no person, who has
either Credit or Reputation in his Country, or can be trusted there for
sixpence, will pretend to prove any such thing.

Mr Clauell in his Petition against Mr Banks Insists to prove, that the Mayor
did allow 5 persons to Vote for a Charity, contrary to all former useage, and
against Law; and also 13 persons more, that pretended to have purchased several
small Tenements of one Mr Dackombe, just before the Election; which, as is
conceived, is expressly against the late Act of Parliament, for preventing the
splitting and dividing of interest in Houses or Lands, in order to multiply
Votes: for that the same was not known in the Borough above a week before the
Election, and the Leases were dated all of one day, and some of the persons
that bought the said Tenements never had seen them, or took possession of the
same, until the day of Election. Which said 5 Trustees, and 13 new made Votes,
voted all for Mr Banks and Mr Fownes. Which, if set aside, then the Poll will
stand, for Mr Culliford 85, for Mr Clauell 63, for Mr Banks 52, and for Mr
Fownes but 34 Votes.
