A RELATION OF The Surrender of LIMERICK.
Published by Authority.
Whitehall, October 12. 1691.
THis Evening arrived here Monsieur de Medac, being sent to the Queen by his
Father, the Baron de Ginkle, General of Their Majesty's Forces in Ireland, with
the welcome News of the actual Surrender of Limericke. The Articles of
Capitulation were finally agreed on, and Signed on the 3d of this Month, and in
pursuance of them, a Gate was delivered up that Evening, it being too late then
to march into the Town, which might have occasioned some Confusion; and on the
4th the whole Irish Town was Surrendered, the Lord Cutts marching in with 7
Regiments of Foot. The Articles are in two Parts; those that relate to Civil
Affairs are Signed by the Lords Justices, the General, and the persons deputed
by the Garrison, and the other, which relates to the Military, by the Generals
on both sides. The French and Irish that have a mind to pass beyond Sea, are,
for their accommodation to continue in the English Town and the Island, till
such time as they can be Shipped. The Castles of Ross and Clare, and all other
Castles and Places that still remain in the hands of the Irish, are to be
forthwith delivered up. Sarsfield, and some others design for France, and
endeavor to pick up some Men; but the ill usage they have had from the French
in Ireland, makes very few willing to go with them.
