A Worthy example of a Virtuous Wife, who fed her Father with her own Milk,
being condemned to be starved to death, and afterward pardoned by the
Emperor. The tune is Flying Fame.
IN Rome, I read, a Noble man,
the Emperor did offend.
And for that fact he was adjudg'd
unto a cruel end.
That he should be in Prison cast,
with Irons many one,
And there be famisht unto death,
and brought to skin and bone.
And more, if any one were known,
by night or yet by day,
To bring him any kind of food,
his hunger to allay.
The Emperor swore a mighty Oath,
without remorse quoth he,
They should sustain the cruelst death,
that could devised be.
This cruel sentence once pronounced
the Noble man was cast,
Into a Dungeon dark and deep,
with Irons fettered fast.
Where when he had with hunger great,
remained ten days space,
And neither tasted meat nor drink,
in this most woeful case.
The tears along his Aged Face,
most plentiously did fall,
And grievously he did begin,
for to complain withal.
O Lord quoth he what shall I do,
so hungry Lord am I,
For want of bread one bit of bread,
I famish starve and dye.
How precious is (...) grain of W^^^^
unto my hungry (...),
One crust, one crumb one little (...)
my hunger to contr^^^.
Had I this Dungeon heaped with gold,
I would forgo it all,
To buy and purchase one brown Loaf,
yea were it never so small.
O that I had but every day,
one bit of it bread to eat,
Though never so moldy, black or brown,
my comfort would be great.
Yea albeit I took it up,
trod down in dirt and mire,
It would be pleasing to my taste,
and sweet to my desire.
Good haw happy is the Hind,
that labors all the day,
Thed rudging the Peasant poor,
that at command does stay:
They have their ordinary meals,
they take no heed at all,
Of those sweet crumbs and crust that they
do carelessly let fall.
How happy is the little chick,
that without fear may go,
And pick up those most precious crumbs,
which they away do throw,
O that some pretty little mouse,
so much my friend would be,
To bring some old forsaken crust,
into this Place to me.
BUT oh, my heart, it is in vain,
no succor can I have,
No meat, no drink, nor water eke,
my loathed life to save.
O bring some bread for Christ's his sake,
some bread, some bread for me,
I dye, I dye for lack of Food,
naught but stone walls I see.
Thus da^e and night he cried out,
in most outrageous sort.
That all the Country far and near,
were grieved at his report,
And though that many friends he had,
and daughters in the Town,
Yet none durst come to succor him,
fearing the Emperors frown.
Yet now behold one daughter dear,
he had as I do find,
Who lived in his displeasure great,
for matching against his mind.
Although he lived in mean estate,
she was a virtuous wife;
And for to help her Father dear,
she ventured thus her life.
She quickly to her sisters went,
and did of them entreat.
That by some secret means they would,
convey their Father meat.
Our Father dear does starve she said,
the Emperors wrath is such,
He dies alas for want of Food,
whereof we have too much.
Sweet sisters therefore use some means,
his life for to preserve,
And suffer not our Father dear,
in prison for to starve.
Alas quoth they what shall we do,
his hunger to sustain,
You know it is death to any one,
that would his life maintain.
And though we wish him well quoth they.
we never will agree
To spoil our selves, we had as leef,
that he should die as we:
And sister if you love your self,
let this attempt alone,
Though you do never so secret work,
at length it will be known.
O has our Father brought us up,
and nourisht us quoth she.
And shall we now forsake him quite
in his extremity:
No, I will venture life and limb,
to do my Father good;
The worst that is I can but die,
to fit a Tirants mood.
With that away in have she hies,
and to the Iaile she goes,
But with her woeful Father dear,
she might not speak God knows;
Except the Emperor would grant,
her favor in that case
This keeper would admit no wight,
to enter in that place.
Then she unto the Emperor hies,
and falling on her knee,
With wringing hands and bitter tears,
these words pronounced she.
My hopeless Father gracious Lord,
offending of your Grace,
Is judged unto a pining death,
within a woeful place.
Which I confess he has deserved,
yet mighty Prince quoth she,
Vouchsafe in gracious sort to grant
one simple boon to me.
It chanced so I matched my self
against my Fathers mind,
Whereby I did procure his wrath,
at Fortune has assigned.
And seeing now the time is come,
he must resign his breath,
Vouchsafe that I may speak with him,
before his hour of death,
And reconcile my se^fe to him,
his favor to obtain;
That when he dies I may not then
under his curse remain.
The Emperor granted her request,
conditionally that she,
Each time unto her Father came
should thorowlie searched be,
No bread nor meat she with her brought
to help him there distressed,
But every day she nourished him,
with her most tender breast.
Thus by her milk he was preserved
a twelve month and day,
And was most fair and fat to see,
yet no man knew which way,
The Emperor musing much thereat
at length did understand.
How he was fed and yet his Law,
not broke at any hand.
And much admiring at the same,
and her great virtue shown,
He pardoned him and honored her,
with great preferment known,
Her Father ever after that
did love her as his life,
And blessed the time that she was made
a loving wedded wife.
