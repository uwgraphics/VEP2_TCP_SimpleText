A Weeks Loving, Wooing, and Wedding: OR, Happy is that Wooing that is not long
a Doing.
Here was a nimble Bridegroom, and a Bride,
In Eight short days the long fast Knot was tied.
To the Tune of Billy and Molly.
Licensed according to Order.




ON Sunday Johnny went to Church
so sprute, and neat, and finey,
Cupid lay for John at lurch,
and showed him pretty Jinny,
Johnny was shot to the heart,
and proved a zealous Lover,
That Jenny she might cure his smart,
he was resolved to move her.
Johnny was a stitching Blade,
and he could not work a Monday;
Jinny loved the stitching Trade,
but minded John a Sunday:
He to her did make Address,
but she received it shiely,
The loving truth he did confess,
but Jinny she was wily.
Thesday came, and Johnny then
professed to her profoundly,
He loved her more than any Man,
and spoke his Passion roundly;
Jinny she did love to spin,
as pretty Maids do often,
She fancied John could put it in,
and that did Jinny soften.


On Wednesday then the Lovers met,
and Johnny pressed her home to it;
he said his Love was on her set,
but she said naught but mum to it:
Jinny was a coming Lass,
her Silence was consenting,
When John had brought it to that pass,
he then fell to presenting.
On Thursday then he brought her store,
what Maid could have forsook 'em?
Of Ribbons, Gloves, with sundry more,
and she said No, and took 'em:
Johnny was a Lover free,
though bound in Jinny's Fetters,
Jinny loved as well as he,
though she might a had his Betters.
On Friday Johnny asked her what
she had to say against it;
She said there was two words to that,
for fear she should repent it:
But John he did her so persuade,
that she gave no denial,
But said he should be her own Blade,
and put it to the Trial.
On Saturday there never was seen
such Billing, and such Cooing;
Jinny and her John between,
such Kissing and such Wooing.
Thus both agreed in Love to speed,
concluded on the Morrow,
That they would Wed, and so to Bed,
and sport away all Sorrow.
On Sunday they to Church did go,
where Love first had beginning,
The Parson he made one of two,
so the Business had an ending:
John and Jinny married were,
O! merry night of Sunday!
Pretty Maids do not Despair,
'twill be your own case one day.
