TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE LORDS, THE PEERS In the High Court of PARLIAMENT
assembled. The humble Petition of the Majors, Bayliffes, Jurats, Freemen, and
others Inhabitants of the Cinque Ports, two ancient Towns, and their Members,
Shows,
THAT your Petitioners have just and great cause, with all thankfulness,
humbly and heartily to acknowledge your Honors exceeding labor and pains
taken in this present Parliament, and the agreement of your Lordships with the
Honorable house of Commons, which tends to the glory of God, the Honor and
safety of his Majesty, the good of this State and Kingdom; which by your
great wisdoms and noble endeavors have been effected, and by us your
Petitioners obtained and enjoyed, in the reducing the government of this
Kingdom to the ancient and pristine government of the inheritable Laws
thereof, vindicating the Rights and Prerogative of his Majesty, and Liberty of
the Subjects, securing of our lives and estates in your zealous ejection and
eradicating of the formidable power of the Prelates in their Civil
authorities: And we humbly beg of your Lordships, that this happy union may
ever continue, and more especially at this present, for the accomplishing of
what is already begun, and for a full and absolute reformation of the
government and grieveances both in the State, Church and Commonwealth: And we,
with the utmost of our lives and estates, are fully determined to defend his
Majesty's Royal Person and State, and your Lordships in your joint, happy and
honorable resolutions and proceedings. And further our most humble and earnest
suit is, that your Lordships, out of your great care and wisdoms, will by
some good ways and means obtain his Majesty's Royal Person and presence
near the Parliament, with the Prince his Highness, for the better effecting
of all your worthy intents and purposes, and for the happiness and flourishing
estate of King and Kingdom. And we (according to the Protestation by us
already taken) will readily expose our selves and fortunes for the maintenance
of the same.

And your humble Petitioners shall ever pray, etc.

TO THE HONORABLE, THE KNIGHTS, CITIZENS, AND BURGESSES in the Commons House
of PARLIAMENT assembled. The humble Petition of the Majors, Bayliffes, Jurats,
Freemen, and others Inhabitants of the Cinque Ports, two ancient Towns, and
their Members,
Shows,
THAT your Petitioners (with the body of this Kingdom) do with all
thankfulness acknowledge your indefatigable pains and cares (besides the
several attempts that have been offered against your persons and Privileges)
in your pious and politic endeavors for the glory of God, and settling of
the peace of this Kingdom: Which although it have not hitherto performed the
desired ends and effects expected, yet our thankfulness is unto you never the
less, your Petitioners conceiving the causes of such distractions and slow
proceedings in matters of greatest consequence, as also those distempers in the
State and City to proceed from evil Councillors, too near his Majesty's
Sacred Person, and such their Councels fomented by ill affected instruments
both in Court and City; yet nevertheless your Petitioners, and all others
well affected to true Religion, the honor of his Majesty, and good of his
Kingdom, to Gods glory do confess and testify the great good that has
succeeded and been effected by you, in subverting the power and rule of
Antichrist, in supporting and maintaining his Majesty's Honor and right of
Prerogative in things obvious to all the world, and also in achievement of the
lawful liberties of the Subject, and vindicating the government to the rule
of the inheritable Laws of this Land, from all those forced illegal
pressures, under which your Petitioners were heavily burdened, contrary to the
ancient privileges of their Charter, confirmed by his Majesty and his Noble
Progenitors, and has inviolably continued unto them near six hundred years
past, till of late time. For which privileges your Petitioners are obliged to
great and considerable services, and have duly performed them, as may be made
apparent. And also humbly praying that this Honorable Assembly will seriously
consider the situation of our Towns, being seated upon the breast of the
Kingdom, and thereby necessitated to bear the brunt and first onset of any
invasion of Foreign enemies; and therefore for defense of the whole Kingdom,
we are treblely charged with Arms and Ammunition to what the Counties are,
besides the mentenance of many great Ordnance, with provision for them, at our
own cost, with many other charges and burdens, too heavy for us alone to
bear, most of which has been by some already made known unto this Honorable
House, although many more might be added thereunto.

All which considered, our Petitions are, that (notwithstanding all disgusts,
threats and affronts that have bin offered, or that may be) you will
courageously go on in the reformation and settling of the pure worship of God,
according to his word, both in Doctrine and Discipline, wholly casting out all
the dregs and remains of Popery and Superstition, that Jesus Christ by his
word may alone rule and govern his Church in purity; Removing ignorant,
superstitious and scandalous Ministers, and placing of painful and pious
Preachers in their places with competent mentenance; Providing for his
Majesty, and the Kingdoms safety, by going on in your resolutions for a
Posture of Warlike defense throughout the same; In which we humbly pray, the
Cinque Ports, Towns and members may be in time provided for with sufficient
means for their Fortifications; and especially that a defense may be made upon
the Roades of Dungen-nasse, the only dangerous and most easy landing place
for any invasive enemies; And that the unlawful and destructive manner of
fishing of the French upon the English Coast may be restrained: That the Fees
of his Majesty's Custom House in the Ports may be regulated; That this
Honorable house will be further pleased to endeavor, by all good ways and
means, to procure the presence and residence of his Majesty and the Prince to
be near unto the Parliament, for the effectual speeding the aids and
supplies of distressed IRELAND, where our Brethrens blood cries loud to Heaven
for pity and relief; That the Fundamental and Parliamentary Laws of this
Kingdom, the Privileges of Parliament, His Majesty's Rights and Prerogative,
our native Rights and Privileges be mentained, our lives and estates secured;
And that all the wisdoms and endeavors of this Honorable Assembly may
conduce to the happiness both of Church, State and Commonwealth, in
establishing of a faithful Magistracy, a pious and faithful Ministry; And
that this Honorable House be pleased to put the government of the Forts into
such hands as his Majesty and the Parliament shall see fit, and may confide
in. Toward which (according to the Protestation taken by us) we are ready to
expose (as his Majesty and the Parliament shall command) the utmost of our
lives and fortunes; And your Petitioners with all duty and respect, shall ever
pray for you all in general, and every one of you in particular.
