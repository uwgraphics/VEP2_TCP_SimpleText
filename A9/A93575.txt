AN EPISTLE TO THE CHURCHES OF THE ANABAPTISTS SO CALLED. Written by a Member
of the CHVRCH, and sent abroad in pursuance of a printed paper from TIVERTON,
directed to all the CHVRCHES of JESUS CHRIST.
Friends,
I Am constrained with compassion to the opprossed seed in you, which groans to
be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the sons of
God, and likewise enjoined as a member of the Church of Christ, in bowels of
love and tenderness, to write unto you, which I hope will be profitable to such
as are earnestly coveting after the best things, though for the present many of
you are scattered upon the barren mountains as sheep without a Shepherd, and
wandering in the wilderness in a dark and solitary way; He that has an care
to hear, let him hear what the Spirit says unto the Churches; and to the
Pastors and Teachers of your Churches write I these things, in the name and
fear of the Lord, before whom your works have not been found perfect; for you
have had a name to live, while death has reigned over many of you; the day is
far spent, and the shadows of the evening are stretched forth, and the night
comes wherein no man can work; therefore repent, and while you have the light,
believe in the light, and bring all your deeds to the light, to be proved and
tried, that they may be wrought in God; and neglect not the great salvation
which now is begun to be spoken of in these last days, wherein iniquity has
abounded, and the man of sin has been exalted, and the love of many has waxen
cold, who in words profess they know God, and in works deny him; the Spirit of
the Lord strives with you as it did with the children of disobedience in the
days of Noah; and the baptism that now saves us is not only the putting away
of the filth of the flesh, (and carnal washings) but the answer of a good
conscience toward God, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is come a
Light into the world, and by the brightness of his rising (in the hearts of
his people) does he reveal the man of sin, and the mystery of iniquity, with
the abomination that was spoken of by the Prophet, which has been exalted
among you, and yet stands where it ought not: And now the Law is changed, and
the Priesthood changed, and the carnal Ordinances are to cease, and the
Covenant, which made not the comers thereunto perfect; for the weakness and
unprofitablenesse of it is done away, and the Handwriting of Ordinances
blotted out, and Christ Jesus the Mediator of the new Covenant witnessed, who
is the Head of the Church, the everlasting Teacher of his people, the
High Priest and Apostle of our profession, the chief Shepherd and Bishop of our
souls, and they that are with him, are called, and chosen, and faithful, and
circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, by the putting off the
body of the sins of the flesh, buried with him in baptism, and quickened
together with him by the faith of the opperation of that eternal Spirit that
raised up Jesus from the dead: And they only are Members of his Church that
are thus made conformable to him in his death, and quickened together with him,
and raised up by the power of his resurrection, and such cannot be subject to
the worlds worships, customs and fashions, nor to its Ordinances, as those are
who lives in the world. Therefore touch not, taste not, handle not those things
which perishes with the using, and does not make the comers thereunto perfect:
Seek not the living among the dead and carnal Ordinances, and
bodily-exercises, which are altogether unprofitable, and according to the
tradition received from men, for the kingdom of God comes not with
observations. Arise, arise, for this is not your rest because it is poluted:
God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts to
give us the knowledge of his glorious Gospel in the face of Jesus Christ, whom
he has sent forth in these last days for a light unto the Gentiles, a Leader
of his people, and for salvation to all the ends of the earth; who comes to be
glorified in his Saints, and who (...) to be worshipped in the spirit, and in
the truth, and they that do not worship him in the spirit and in the truth,
they worship they know not what, even the unknown. God ignorantly, and such are
not the Church of Christ, what ever they profess.

Lately I saw printed Epistle, signed by Thomas Collier and others, wherein
your condition in some measure was expressed and confessed; and truly, mine eye
affects my heart at the consideration thereof; I cannot but bewail those great
abominations by which the Lord God Almighry, of power and purity, is provoked
to jealousy, and even to give you up to strong delusions, to observe lying
vanities, because you like not to retain God in your knowledge, since that
which may be known of him is manifested in you, as has (both in word and
writing) been freely declared to many of you; and yet this seat of the Image of
jealousy remains among you, and the accursed thing which makes you fall before
your enemies, and renders you uncomely in the sight of men, as you have confessed.

Now friends I must deal plainly with you, that a separation may be made
between the precious and the vile, the holy and the profane, that they who are
of the Synagogue of Satan, may be delivered unto Satan; for as their blasphemy
was known that said they were Jews and were not, so their presumption is now
seen that calls themselves the Church of Christ, and are not: Being moved of
the Lord, I cannot but give in my Testimony as a Mite into his everlasting
treasury, by declaring plainly unto you, That you are not in reality and truth
what you profess to be, and as the Direction or Preface to that Epistle
bespeak^ you; for the Church is as a Lilly among Thorns, (in relation to your
condition therein expressed) or as an Apple Tree among the Trees of the Wood, and
is builded upon the foundation of many Generations, being living Stones, elect,
and precious; and with the love of Christ, who is the Head of his Church, his
members are constrained to follow him, as the Captain of their salvation, in
honor, and dishonor; in good report, and evil report; liberty, and bonds,
persecutions, and tribulations; and because of the savor of his good
Ointments, the Virgins, his followers, loves him dearly, yea above all the
worlds glory and friendship, and the love of the world has not, nor never can
be able, (like a Canker) to eat out their affections to the Lord Jesus, as you
have confessed in your Epistle, concerning them to whom it was sent, with whom
you say, it is on your hearts to live and dye.

You say you have been arraigning the abominations of Zion before the Bar of
the Most high: But upon search it is found to be your own, and your Churches
abominations, for you say iniquity has been apparently written upon their
foreheads; but the daughters of Zion are redeemed with judgment, and her
Converts with righteousness, and they that stand with the Lamb upon Mount
Zion, has the Fathers Name written in their foreheads, and they are redeemed
from the earth, and in their mouths no guile is found, neither are they defiled
with women, nor with the pollutions of the world; but have washed their
Garments, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, having come through
great tribulations, and through the washing of regenerations. Also you say you
have made confession of these reigning abominations in your selves, and in the
Churches, that light spirit, that wretched worldly spirit, that coldness and
deadness, that Laodicean spirit that is fallen in upon you.

Oh friends! charge not these iniquities upon Zion, nor upon the Members of the
Church of Christ, who are one Spirit with him; nor put not these things afar
off, but repent, and humble your selves before the Lord, and lay not these
things to the Saints charge: For Zions sake, and for the Churches sake I cannot
be silent, for they are not guilty of these things charged upon them; its your
own condition, by your own confession; and therefore I counsel you to buy Gold
tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white raiment, that you may be
clothed; and Eye Salve, that you may come to see the things which concerns your
eternal peace, which has been long hid from your eyes whilst you have been
crying up your selves as the Church of Christ, and thought you were rich, and
said you saw, when indeed you were poor and miserable, blind and naked; And
these things are justly fallen upon you, since you set your selves to oppose
and contend against the light of Christ in the conscience, which makes manifest
and reproves all things which is contrary to the will and mind of God, where it
is believed in and loved. Truly your wound is almost incurable, its your
iniquities that makes the separation between you and your God, and your sins
that withholds good things from you, as you are in part sensible, and have
herein confessed, that the worlds glory has bewitched you, and alienated you
from the Lord. And further, That this iniquity has been apparently written
upon your foreheads, (to wit) personal-iniquity, Congregational-iniquity,
Family-iniquity, Closset-iniquity, etc. Oh what bruises and putrefying sores is
found among you! What a shattered building is this! no soundness, no zeal,
without hope, without God in the world, affections to Christ eaten up, with the
love thereof, rebelling against the light, cruel to servants and children,
exacting all their labors; formal in holy duties, having the shadow, but not
the substance; the form of godliness, but not the power thereof; the sign, but
not the seal of the Covenant. Arise ye that sit in dust, awake ye that are
asleep in this condition, least your Candle be put out, and the day of your
visitation pass over: Light has long shined in a dark place, and the
darkness comprehended it not: And the blind Watchmen have said, Lo here is
Christ, and lo there is Christ, and have deceived many that have been inquiring
after the good old way, and have told them that the light within is natural,
and that the Scriptures was the Word of God: But I say unto you, Go not forth,
believe them not, for they that made known the power and coming of the Lord
Jesus, who were eyewitnesses of his Glory, and of his Majesty, were sent to
turn people from the darkness to the light, and from under Satan's power, unto
God, and declared that which they had heard, and seen, tasted of, and handled
of the Word of life, which was nigh them, even in their hearts, and in their
mouths, and this is the Word of Faith which we preach: And this I declare unto
you by the same spirit, That we have a more sure Word of Prophecy then that
which was seen in the Mount, unto which ye do well to take heed, as unto a
light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise
in your hearts, that you may come to see the salvation of God.

Likewise they complain of your neglect of the poor Saints, which is indeed an
evil, for he that has this worlds good, and sees his brother have need, and
shuts up his compassion against him, how dwells the love of God in that man?
He cannot be by us owned as a Member of the Church of Christ: Also of your
neglect of the Ministers, and remissness in Meetings, which may be excused, for
the Ministers of Christ does not murmr nor cry out of wants, nor complain in
the streets, though they be sent forth many times as sheep among wolves, and
persecuted ^^om city to city, and some of them cast into prison, as it is at
this day witnessed, neither need they murmr or complain, for the Lord
provides food and raiment for them, and they are therewith content, and they
have no Letters of recommendation, but does in the sight of God commend
themselves to that of God in every man's conscience, unto which they are made
manifest. And as for your remissness in Meetings, I cannot much blame you, in
regard you have profited so little by their Ministry; for had they stood in
Gods counsel, your Meetings would have been for the better, and not for the
worse; and that desire which has appeared in many of you after the Lord, would
have been strengthened, and your thirsty souls satisfied and refreshed, for
where ever two or three are gathered together in the Name of the Lord, his
presence is witnessed among them: and they that wait upon the Lord, does daily
renew their strength, and as their eyes comes to be opened that have heaped up
Teachers to themselves in the time of ignorance, they cannot but withdraw from
them, though they suffer affliction with the people of God, who are all the day
long accounted as sheep for the slaughter, or as men not fit to live upon the
earth.

The Authors of the Epistle sent to you, has left things therein contained, to
be farther opened by those whom the Lord has entrusted with his Oracles: And I
am enjoined, and it lies upon me as a duty (being a Member of the Church of
Christ) to deal plainly with you; for all you that are found guilty of the
abominable iniquities, Laodicean spirit, pride and cruelty, deadness, and
earthly-mindedness, etc. are by the Elders of our Church (in the behalf of all
the Members thereof) utterly denied to be of us.

Neither can you be owned by us, nor received into fellowship with us, till you
cleanse your hands, and purify your hearts, till you wash you, and make you
clean from all the pollutions of Idols, and until you repent and be baptized,
for its not every one that says, The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the
Lord, that are the children of Abraham: Neither is it circumcision, nor
uncircumcision that avails any thing, but a new creature, and faith which
works by love, and whosoever believes, and is baptized, shall be saved: But
all that are dipped once or twice in the water, are not baptized with the
baptism of Christ, to wit, the circumcision of the heart, which is the Seal of
the righteousness of faith, He that can receive it, let him, and whosoever
cannot receive the things of the spirit of God, are none of the Church of
Christ, neither may they be permitted to break bread with us before they be
baptized with the baptism a of Christ, for such does not discern the Lords body
before they own and believe in the light which was in the beginning with God,
by which Enoch saw him who is invisible, and by which Abraham saw the Sons day,
and rejoiced; and by which we behold his glory, as the glory of the only
begotten of the Father, who is full of grace and truth: And this is the Message
that we have to declare, and which I here declare unto you, That God is light,
and in him is no darkness at all; and if you return to the light, and believe
in the light, and love the light, and bring all your deeds to the light, and
walk in obedience, then have you fellowship with us, and we can own you, and
receive you into the Church without any Letters of Recommendation from men, and
have union with you in the spirit, and so you may eat with us in our Fathers
House of the Bread of Life which came down from Heaven: For the Cup of Blessing
which we bless, is the Communion of the blood of Christ; and the Bread which
we break is the Communion of the Body of Christ; for we being many, are one
Bread and one Body, and they that are not baptized by one spirit into one body,
are not of the Church of Christ, neither can we own them as Members thereof.

This may let you know, that by diligent search we have found you out to be one
with the world in many things, as also is in your Epistle expressed, wherein
you have brought forth the dry bones of your Congregations, and even spread
them before the Sun in the open valley, that he that runs may read what birth
is brought forth, and what image is born: Your Teachers complains of formality
in holy duties, and yet confesses themselves to be guilty of the same thing:
Alas! How can it be otherwise with you so long as you own such for your
Teachers who has the form of godliness, and not the power of it? Is not the
Scripture here in full filled, They ran, I never sent them, says the Lord,
therefore they shall not profit this people at all: The Leaders of my people
cause them to err, and they that are led of them are destroyed for want of
knowledge; the Pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the Lord,
therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flock shall be scattered

Surely the Husbandmen begins to be ashamed of their work, and the
Vine-deessers begins to weep and howl, as if the Seed were rotten ununder the
Clods, and little fruit is brought forth to perfection, witness their
complaint in the forementioned Epistle, wherein they confess they have labored
in vain, and that which has been brought forth has been to so little
purpose: Let not these things be declared in Gath, nor published in the Streets
of Askelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines should pejoice over you, for
the Church of Christ does deny such a Testimony, and such Teachers.

Therefore all you that are simple-hearted, and hungers and thirsts after
righteousness, come out from amongst them, and be ye separate, lest you perish
in their gain-sayings; spend not your money for that which is no bread, and
your labor for that which does not profit, but come to the waters freely, and
drink without money and without price; incline your ears, and come hearken
diligently, and hear, that your souls may live, that you may eat that which is
good, and be abundantly satisfied therewith; for though you played the Harlot,
and destroyed your selves with many Lovers, and have been as the degenerate
plant of a strange Vine to God, yet there is mercy with him that he may be
feared; and he spreads forth his hands all the day long, saying, Yet return
unto me, and I will heal your back slidings, and receive you, and love you
freely, and you shall be my Sons and Daughters, says the Lord, who is faithful
and just to forgive, and to blot out all your iniquities, transgressions and
sins, and to cleanse you from all filthiness both of the flesh and spirit.

And now friends in your Fasts and solemn Assemblies, in order (as you say) to
the purging out of sin and sinners, beware of smiting with the fist of
wickedness, and take heed of judging any thing before the time; for the
Pharisees fasted often, and the unbelieving Jews agreed together to cast such
out of their Synagogues as confessed Christ, and they cast him out whose eyes
Christ had opened.

Now there is need of found discerning in this great work of binding and
loosing, receiving in, and casting out; for the Lord is working a wonderful
work, and creating a new thing in the earth, and opening the eyes of many who
comes to see the end of the worlds Ordinances and will-worships, (so highly
esteemed among men) and such you need not cast out, nor bring under dealing,
but leave them to their freedom, to worship God in the spirit and in the truth;
but let sin and sinners be plainly dealt with, and declared against, till
they confess and forsake; and let all who are in the transgression keep
silence in the Church, for we permit none to speak but as they are moved by the
Holy Ghost, and take heed of despising prophecy, or quenching the spirit
either in sons or daughters, servants or handmaids, for the spirits of the
Prophets are subject to the Prophets, and they may all speak one by one, and if
any thing be revealed to another that sits by, let the first hold his peace,
that in the Church all things may be done decently and in order. And let this
Epistle be read among you with the spirit, and with the understanding, and
receive it with meekness, from a Member of the Church of Christ, a Companion to
all that loves truth in the inward parts, who suffers persecution for the
Testimony of Jesus, and the Word of God,

The third day of the tenth Month, 1657. THOMAS SALTHOVSE.
