may no Surgeon hear your mones; and all your joys be fighs and groans, may the
running of the Reins, or the Quinsie ceaze your brains; May the toothach, and
the f^aver, to plague you still do their endeavor; May the Strangullion be
your best friend, and nere forsake you till your end; May you be the peoples
scorn, and curse the hour that you were borne; May Bedlam or Bridewell be all
the house you have to dwell; May your childrens children beg from door to
door, and all their kindred, may they still be poor; May a guilty Conscience
still affright ye, and no earthly joys delight ye; May you have aches in your
rotten bones, and gravel in your kidneys and your stones; May your Daughters
all turn Whores, and their Fathers keep the doors, May they never sleep in
quiet, and fear poison in their diet; May they never sorrow lack, and so the
peddler shuts his pack. Only when they dye (cause they were never true) when
that their souls dedepart, Devil claim thy due.
