Humble PETITION of the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London,

of the City of LONDON.

LONDON, Printed by Richard Cotes. 1646.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE LORDS Assembled in High Court of PARLIAMENT; The
Humble Petition of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London,
in Common Council Assembled,
SHOWS;
THat the loud and unanimous cry of many thousands of our fellow-Citizens, as
well as our own sense and fellow-feeling, has obliged us to make this present
Interposition, amongst other your public and weighty Affairs; We do in the
annexed, humbly offer unto your Lp their own words and expressions, with some
omissions and few alterations, as they were delivered unto us by a great number
of considerable Citizens of known worth, and of approved integrity to the
Parliament; that your Lordships may the more clearly see the deep sense they
have of the growing miseries and increasing distractions of these times; The
chief matter thereof is the same with our late addresses, unto which we humbly
hope your Lps will still find the same reasons to give your favorable
acceptance and noble regard, as we humbly and thankfully acknowledge you
readily showed unto the same when we rendered them unto your Lordships, as the
representative Body of the City alone. The obligation that lies upon us to
them, the duty we owe to the Parliament, and the interest this City has in the
Peace of the whole Kingdom, would not permit us either to reject their
Petitions, or to conceal their Grievances from your Lordships, neither yet can
we our selves but both own their griefs and fears, and so humbly join with them
in the same desires.

But to those Reasons in which we have concurred with our said Fellow-Citizens,
for the more speedy disbanding of that Army among others, which has in the
sight of the Kingdom by Gods blessing obtained so many signal Victories; We
humbly crave leave, that as we detract not from their merit, so we may also
add thus much, which is daily complained of, That there are some Officers, and
many common Soldiers of that Army, who either have never taken the Covenant, or
are disaffected to the Church Government held forth by the Parliament; That the
Pulpits of diverse godly Ministers are often usurped by Preaching Soldiers, and
others, who infect their Flock, and all places where they come, with strange
and dangerous Errrours; And then we humbly submit it to your Lordships to
consider, what security or settlement can be expected while they are Masters of
such a power; and what example, if not encouragement, the people may take from
them, to refuse the Covenant; or if they have taken it, to contemn the same, to
the great derogation of that Church Government, which the Parliament has
declared. We humbly hope, that although such were dismissed, the Parliament by
their authority may otherwise, if occasion shall require, sufficiently provide
for the safety of the Kingdom.

But this great work, as also that which is of so high concernment to the
establishing of a perfect and well grounded Peace, (The bringing home of his
Majesty) we do humbly and wholly submit, and commit next to the Almighty hand
of Gods Providence, unto the Wisdom of both Houses of Parliament, being
confident that they will preserve and defend His Majesty's Royal Person, and
Authority, in the preservation and defense of the true Religion and Liberties
of the Kingdom, according to the Covenant.

To that also which concerns the Estates of Delinquents which are under
Sequestration, or are or shall be either wholly confiscated, or else compounded
for, We humbly desire leave to add this Petition in behalf of our selves, and
many thousands of our fellow-Citizens and all others who have adhered to the
Parliament, That all just Debts may be first paid and satisfied, and to that
end that no Committees of Sequestration or Sequestrators may interrupt just
proceedings at Law for recovery of such Debts. And that the Heirs and Estates
of those who have died since these Wars on the Enemies Part, may be yet
liable to pay just Debts, notwithstanding any Entailes or Deeds in Trust, made
since the beginning of these general Distractions, which are conceived to have
been made purposely to defeat the Creditor. And because of the long continuance
of these Wars and Divisions, that the Statute may not be pleaded to any Book
Debt for not being demanded within six years since the beginning of the
Parliament, otherwise there are none in the Kingdom like to suffer more then
the well-affected, and such as have adhered to the Parliament.

Lastly, We humbly conclude with this Petition in behalf of this City, That as
this Court as the Representative Body of the City, has hitherto by Authority
of Parliament had the nomination of the Persons entrusted with their Militia,
so now also we may by Ordinance of Parliament be authorized to elect and choose
fit Persons for that Charge once every year, agreeable to the Practice and
Custom of the City in all other chief Offices and Trusts concerning their
Government.

And now whatsoever Expressions or Desires our Cares and Fears have led us
unto, or what ever we or our fellow-Citizens have presumed to take notice of,
or touch upon, We humbly pray both for our selves and them, That your
Lordships will remit all to our and their great ze^le for Gods Glory and the
Peace of the Kingdom. And that it may be remembered, That we and they are
those whom you have with your selves engaged in one Covenant, to whom God has
given Hearts as well to adventure all for your Service and preservation, as to
be ever thankful for the continual protection and great deliverances they
have received by Gods blessing through your constant Endeavors, and whose
hands God has strengthened to fight his and your Battles; We do humbly assure
your Lps that we and they have still the same dutiful hearts, and in the
sincere pursuance of our solemn League and Covenant, no Interest or influence
shall (with the blessing of God) be ever able to withdraw our obedience, or
divert our affections from the Parliament of England.

We humbly submit all to your L^ great Wisdoms, and shall daily pray, etc.
