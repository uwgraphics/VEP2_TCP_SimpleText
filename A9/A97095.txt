Good counsel to all those that heartily desire the glory of God, the freedom
of the Commonwealth, and the good of all virtuous men.
YOu are most earnestly entreated to take notice, and to be warned of a most
pestilent and dangerous design lately practiced by some hellish Politicians,
tending to the dividing of the honest party amongst themselves, thereby to
weaken them, and to give advantages to the Common Enemies.

The ground of their design is, The difference of judgment in matters of
Religion amongst conscientious well minded people, occasion being taken from
thence to make them not only to despise and hate one another, but as odious to
the generality of good men as are thieves, murderers and harlots.

The means they use to promote their design, is principally to broach some
gross and foolish errors; and then to father them on all those that are
called Anabaptists, Antinomians, Brownists, Separatists or Independents:

Persuading and possessing the people:

First, concerning the Anabaptists, That they hold all government in the
Commonweal to be unlawful; which you are to know is most pernicious
delusion, for they approve of, and do submit unto all government that is
agreed on by common consent in Parliament; and disapprove only of arbitrary and
tyrannical government, usurpations and exorbitances in Magistrates and
Officers; and have disbursed their moneys and hazarded their lives as freely
for their just government, and liberties of this Nation, as any condition of
men whatsoever.

Secondly, That the Antinomians do hold, that a Believer may live as he list!
even in all licentiousness: which is most grossly false: there being no
Scripture more frequent in their mouths then this, namely, The love of God
bringing salvation to all men has appeared, teaching us to deny all
ungodliness and wordly lusts, and to live righteously and godly, and soberly
in this present world.

Thirdly, That the Brownists, Separation and Independents do hold that all
other Protestants are in a damnable condition, who do hold fellowship, Church
society, and communion with grossly, vicious and wicked persons: which also is
most notoriously false: for they do not so judge of any; but do judge that
themselves having (to their apprehensions) grounds in Scripture, proving the
unlawfulness of such mixed communions, may not, nor dare not so communicate:
And as concerning others they judge (as themselves would be judged) that they
exercise their Religion in that way which appears to them most agreeable to
the Word of God.

When these sowers of division have possessed the people, that these and the like
absurdities are held by them: Then they advise them to fly from them as from
Serpents, and not to hear them or discourse with them, as they tender the
safety of their souls; and make them glad and rejoice when they hear any of
them are imprisoned or silenced; or their books (though slightly and absurdly)
answered: and when they hear that many of them are forsaking the Kingdom, and
betaking themselves to the West Indies and other places for Liberty of their
Consciences (as void of all remorse) they cry out, Let them go, a good
riddance, it will never be well in England (say they) so long as these Sects
are permitted to live amongst us; nor until the Parliament do set up one
express way for exercise of Religion, and compel all men to submit thereunto,
and most severely to punish all such as will not.

But you will find that this is the very voice of Prelacie, and the authors
thereof to be the very same in heart, what ever they are in clothes and
outside -- And that it is not the voice of the Apostles, who required that
every man should be fully persuaded in his own mind of the lawfulness of
that way wherein he served the Lord; and that upon such a ground as no
authority on earth can ever dispense withal, namely, That whatsoever is not of
faith (or full assurance of mind) is sin.

Our Savior Christ did not use the Sadduces in so unkind a manner, and yet
they held more dangerous opinions then any that are accused in our times; for
they believed that there was no resurrection, and that there was neither Angel
nor Spirit; though they came to him in a kind of insolent confidence in these
their opinions, which he knew sufficiently, He, nevertheless both heard and
answered them gently; he did not revile them with reproachful language,
telling them that they were not worthy to live in a Commonwealth; nor did he
warn others to discourse with them; he did not command their persons to be
imprisoned, nor declare their lives to be forfeited: It is likely they lived
quietly, and (in all civil respects) according to the loves of the Country,
and were honester men then the Scribes and Pharisees who were hypocrites: and
so, as the true author of his Apostles doctrine, he allowed them to be fully
persuaded in their own minds, using no means but argument and persuasion to
alter or control their judgments: He knew that men might live peaceably and
lovingly together, though they differ in judgment one from another: Himself
was composed of love, and esteemed nothing so precious as love; His servant and
Apostle Paul was of the same mind also, affirming that though he had all
faith and al knowledge, and understood all mysteries, though he could speak
with the tongues of men and of Angels, and have not love, he is nothing, a
mere sounding brass or tinckling symball: he desires that who are strong in
the faith, should bear with those that are weak, advises him that eats that
he should not condemn him that eats not: where one observed a day to the
Lord, and others not (though a matter of great moment) yet he allows every
one to be fully persuaded in his own mind: Now if our Savior and his
Apostle, that could infallibly determine what was truth, and what was error,
did nevertheless allow every man to be fully persuaded in his own mind, and
did not command any man upon their authority to do any thing against judgment
and conscience -- What spirit are they of, whose Ministers are they, that would
have all men compelled to submit to their probabilities and doubtful
determinations?

The Apostle persuades those who^ he instructed to try all things: These allow
not things to be compared, they take liberty to speak what they please in
public against opinions and judgments, under what nicknames they think
fittest to make them odious, and write and Print, and license the same,
wresting and misapplying the Scriptures to prove their false assertions; but
stop all men's mouths from speaking, and prohibit the Printing of any thing
that might be produced in way of defense and vindication; and if any thing be
attempted, spoken or published without authority or license, Pursuivants, fines
and imprisonments, are sure to wait the Authors, Printers and publishers.

And though experience of all times under Popery and Prelacie, have proved this
a vain way to bring all men to be of one mind, yet these men are not yet made
wiser by the folly of others, but suffer themselves to be outwitted by the
devilish policies of those that put them on in those compulsive and
restrictive courses, as knowing it to be the only means to obstruct the truth,
to multiply opinions, and cause divisions, without which they know they should
in vain attempt the bondage or destruction of the honest party.

Be you therefore wise in time, and speedily and freely unite your selves to
those your brethren, though reproached with never so many nicknames, and use
all lawful means for their ease and freedom, and for protection from
reproach, injury or violence, that they may be encouraged to abide in, and
return unto this our distressed country, and to contribute their utmost
assistance to free the same from the bloody intentions of the common enemies,
and give them assurance of a comfortable freedom of conscience when a happy
end shall be given to these woeful times: you cannot deny but that they are to
be trusted in any employment equal to any condition of men, not one of them
having proved false hearted or treacherous in any public employment: stick
you therefore close to them, they will most certainly stick close to you;
which if you do, all the Popish and malignant party in the world will not be
able to circumvent you: but if you suffer your selves to be so grossly deluded
as to despise or renounce their assistance and association, you shall soon
perceive your selves to be over-growne with malignants (the taking of a
Covenant will not change a blackamore) your bondage will be speedy and
certain: The ground upon which you renounce them is so unjust and contrary to
the word of God, that God cannot prosper you; you have therefore no choice at
all; but if you join not; you perish: Your destruction is of your selves.
(complain of none else) your pride and disdain of them will be your ruin.

Thus have you the faithful advice of him who is neither Anabaptist,
Antinomian, Brownist, Separatist or Independent: But of one that upon good
ground (as he conceives) holds fellowship and communion with the Parochial
congregations, who observing with a ^ad he^^^ the manifold distractions and
divisions amongst his brethren about difference of judgment in matters of
Religion; and finding the same fomented and made use of to the destruction of
the common freedom of his dear Country: He could not forbear to give warning
there of to all sorts of well-affected persons, hoping that they will labor to
inform themselves more truly of the opinions and dispositions of those their
too much despised Brethren; and (as himself has done) resolve henceforward to
join heart and hand with them in all offices of love and mutual assistance of
the Commonwealth.

FINIS.
