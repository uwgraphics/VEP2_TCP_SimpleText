To the Honorable William Lenthall Esquire Speaker of the House of COMMONS, these.
Haste. Present.
Honorable Sir,
THe beaten Enemy flying out of Lancashire into these Parts, we (having put
the County into a posture) fell upon them with what strength we could possible
raise, have taken about 1500. some of which (considerable Persons) tendered
themselves prisoners to me the night before, to wit, the Earl of Traquaire,
Lord Carnagey, Lord Lunton, Lord Ramsey, Sir James Lesley Sir Michael Mismish,
Lieutenant Colonel Graham and many of their Servants, besides many Gentlemen
now at Namptwick, whose Persons and Habit declares them of Quality. The meaner
sort (both men and women,) very Ragged and Poor; The burden of which lies so
heavily upon the poor Country (wanting bread;) that we cannot provide them of
necessaries for life. Duke Hamilton, Sir Marmaduke Langdale, and (...)
Middleton, past through this County with about 5000. few of them Foot, and the
Horse tired with an incessant March, upon whose Rear we gleaned many. We have
taken a P^quet of Papers, which we have sent up to your view; Their March was
into Shropshire, so to Stone in Staffordshire, yesternight to V^^xitor, and (as
we conceive by their motions) to the North. W^ (...) not but you will take a
speedy course for the dispos^ll (...) ^^^mon-Souldiers to ease the Country. No
more at pre^^^^ (...) I am,

Sir Your Humble Servant, Roger VVitbraham, (...)
Namptwich, 22. August, 1648. We intend in regard of the Obstruction (...)
respit the sending of the Paquet of (...) the next Post.



To Lieutenant General Cromwell.
Honorable Sir,
IN p^^tuance of those, you so happily dispersed my, Lord Traquaire, and some
of quality rendered themselves prisoners of their own accord, others we took,
yesternight twelve a clock Duke Hamilton sent a Trumpet (but without writing)
to render himself and the whole Army upon conditions; This enclosed we
returned him by two Gentlemen who are not yet returned, we shall pray your
directions, which in this and other things shall be observed by.

21. August, 1648. Your most humble servants Roger VVilbraham. James Lothian.

Sir,
We shall desire to hear where you are, and how you are, and wherein we may
serve you, and in what condition Warrington is.

We have 1000. of the meanest condition of prisoners who have nothing to
maintain them, nor our Country by reason of the scarcity of Bread able to do
it, we shall desire to know how to dispose of them.



A Copy of the enclosed.
My Lord,
THe Earl of Traquaire and other Lords, etc. Persons of quality, have
voluntarily surrendered themselves to avoid the insolency of the Soldiers, and
understanding by your Trumpeter of your dispofition to do the like, we do
engage that you shall find all noble and civil respects and entertainment.
Lieutenant General Cromwell and the Counties adjacent are resolved upon a
speedy pursuit; This we submit to your Honors consideration and remain

August, 20. 1648. Your Excellencies humble Servants, Roger VVilbraham. James
Lothian.
