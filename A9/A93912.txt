To the READER.
Courteous Reader,
I Have here presented to thy view, the description and use of an Instrument,
which for its excellent and general use, is called the Universal Quadrat, for
by it (being of a portable size) is performed with incredible expedition,
plainness, facility, and pleasure; the whole Doctrine trigonometrical, as well
plain as sphericall; and that two several ways; from whence an innumerable
sort of conclusions Mathematical may be resolved, more then I have here
written, for hereby is resolved as many Propositions, as by any Quadrant,
Circle, Cylinder, Dial, Horoscope, Astrolabe, Globe, Sector, Cross-staff, or
any such like Instrument heretofore devised; and that generally for all
Latitudes: yea, and if you fit Sights accordingly to the planisphere on the
backside, (as I was intended to have showed, had not time called me so fast
away) so as they move about with the Planisphere, the Horizon will show upon
the limb the quantity of any angle taken in the field, as well as the
Theodolite, Plain Table, Circumferentor, or Peractor, or any other such like
Instrument; so that hereby it does appear to be an excellent Companion for most
sorts of men; but especially for Navigators or Travelers. For hereby they may
find Altitude and Declination of Sun or Stars, and thereby the latitude of the
place where they are; where also they may find the Amplitude and Azimuth, and
such like conclusions; whereby they may find the variation of their Compass;
so likewise may they readily find the time of Sunrising and setting, with the
beginning and ending of twilight; the hour of the day by the Sun, and the hour
of the Night by the fixed Stars and Planets; with the time of their Rising,
Southing and Setting, and that very easily and speedily: with the Resolution of
such Nautical Propositions, as are of most frequent use amongst them.

The whole Treatise consists of three Books; the first whereof, shows the
construction and general use of the Instrument; and how thereby to resolve all
such Propositions as may be applied to right lines only; as the proportioning
of lines and superficies, the measuring of all manner of Land, Board, Glass,
Timbet, Stone and such like.

The Second, shows the most plentiful, easy, and speedy Resolution of the
whole Doctrine Trigonometrical, both plain and Spherical, and that two several
ways, with surpassing facility.

The Third, shows how to resolve all such Propositions Astronomical, as are
of most frequent use in the Art of Navigation and Dialling, with the resolution
of all such Nautical Propositions, as are of ordinary use amongst Seamen,
concerning Longitude, Latitude, Rumbe, and Distance.

All which I very well know, may more exactly be performed by the Canon of
Sines, Tangents, and Logarithmes, yet nothing so speedily as on the Instrument:
but for observation an Instrument must be had, wherewith (if thou likest it)
thou art here fitted, both for observation and operation.

Thus desiring thee to accept of this Instrument from me, as I here freely
present it to thee, which I wish even so to further thee, as I know it
sufficient for the performance of much more then I have spoken of it. Farewell.

The First Book.
Showing the description and general use of the Universal Quadrat; and how
thereby to resolve all such Propositions as may be applied unto right lines; as
the proportioning of Lines and Superficies, the measuring of all manner of
Land, Board, Glass, Timber, Stone, and such like.
CHAP. I. The description and making of the Universal Quadrat.
A Quadrat or Square Geometrical is a figure of four equal sides, whose
angles are all right angles, within the limits of which figure, we intend to
describe an Universal Instrument, for the speedy performance of most
Mathematical concusions; and that generally for all Latitudes.

First, therefore, prepare a piece of Box or Brass, and after you have made it
very smooth and plain, cut it directly four square, with four equal sides, and
angles all right. Your Wood or Brass being thus prepared, draw thereupon four
right lines, equally distant or parallel to the edges, all of them cutting one
the other at right angles: let the parallel distance of these lines from the
edges be so much as that you may place the figures to the divisions limb, like
as you may perceive by the figure. This being done, divide each side of the
Square into 100 equal parts, or rather 1000, if quantity will give leave, for
the larger the Instrument is, the more exactly will the conclusions wrought
thereby be performed, but the Instrument not so portable. Then from each
division of the one side, draw parallel lines to the like division on the
opposite side, the like do by the other two sides; so shall the whole face of
the Instrument be filled with parallel lines both ways, and crossing each
other at right angles, according to the common Sinicall Quadrant, and for the
better distinction of these parallels, you may prick every fifth, so may you
guide your eye along upon them the better.

This being done, make choice of one of the angles for a center, as here we
have done at A, from which you shall number the two next sides by 10, 20, 30,
etc. unto 100, and place figures to them in the margin, as you see in the
figure.

Then setting one foot of your Compasses in the center A, with the other opened
to the full length of one of the sides, draw the Quadrant BC over all the
parallels, this Quadrant divide into 90 equal degrees, and subdivide each
degree into as many parts as quantity will give leave, and let them be numbered
with 10, 20, 30, etc. unto 90, both ways, as there you see: and if upon the
center A with any convenient distance you describe another Quadrant, and divide
it into six equal parts as in my other Quadrat set down, and draw slope lines
to each 15th. degrees. in the Quadrant BC, and number them backward, then these
slope lines may be accounted as hours in the art of dialling, and will be
sufficient to perform the whole Art of Dialling, as I have at large taught in
my Book lately published, called the Complete Diallist.

This done, by laying a Ruler upon the center A, and each degree in the
Quadrant. BC, you may divide the two opposite sides from the center, each into
45 unequal degrees called Tangents, let these be numbered by 10, 20 30, etc.
unto 90 degrees, from B at the left hand, to 45 in the opposite angle, and so
on to 90 at C the right hand of the Quadrant, and back again as in the
Quadrant, and as you see in the figure; draw also the diagonal line AD. To this
Instrument, as to all other of this kind, in their use, is added Sights with a
thread, bead, and plummet according to the usual manner.

The fore-side of this Quadrat is of it self (being of a portable size, and
exactly drawn) an absolute Instrument for the speedy resolution of both kinds
of Trigonometria; as well spherical as plain; as shall be made manifest in the
ensuing Treatise, by applying it in several kinds.

But seeing the backside of this Universal Instrument stands yet blank, we
will make use thereof in fixing a moveable Planisphere of Brass thereon; on
which Planisphere, we may project the Sphere in plano with straight lines; and
so by help of a fixed Horizontal line and fixed Almicanters, we shall make this
side also become Universal to perform most Spherical conclusions, and that
most demonstratively, and generally for all Latitudes. The description whereof
is after this manner.

CHAP. II. The description of the backside of the Universrl Quadrat.
FIrst, upon the backside draw four straight lines near to the edges, and
parallel thereto, all cutting one the other at right angles as here in the
figure you may behold; upon which lines you shall insert the degrees of
Altitude, as you shall be showed hereafter; within these degrees draw four
other parallel lines, all cutting one the other at right angles, unto which you
shall draw every tenth degree and set his number thereto as here you see.

This being done inscribe a circle as large as you can within this Square,
within which circle, inscribe two other Concentrical Circles representing the
Ecliptique, the dividing whereof shall hereafter appear.

Then upon the same Radius with this inwardmost circle, describe another Circle
upon some thin smooth plate, this Circle divide into equal 24 parts or hours,
and let every hour be divided into halfs and quarters, or rather minutes if
quantity will give leave and let them be numbered toward the right hand as
here you see.

That done, draw another Concentrical Circle, upon the margin of the hour
Circle, representing the plane of the general Meridian; which divide into four
equal parts in 00, 90: 00, 90: and draw the two Diameters 00, 00: 90, 90,
crossing one the other at right Angles in the Center of the Planisphere; so
shall the Diameter 00. 00, Represent the Equator; and the Diameter 90. 90. the
Circle of the hour of Six; and it is also the Axis of the World; wherein 90 at
the hour of 18, stands for the North pole, and 90 at the hour of 6, stands
for the South pole; then let each Quarter of the Meridian be divided into 90
degrees and numbered from the Equator toward the Poles.

The Meridian being thus divided, lay a Ruler upon each degree thereof counted
from the Equator, and thereby draw parallel lines to the Equator; these
parallels shall represent the Declination of the Sun Moon and Stars; and the
Latitude of Towns, Cities and Countries: and shall divide the Axis according to
the line of Sines.

If again we divide the Equator and each of his Parallels, in the like sort as
the Axes of the World is divided, and then carefully through each degree draw a
line, so as it makes no angles; the lines so drawn shall be Elliptical, and
represent the hour Circles, the Meridian Circle the hour of 12 at Noon and
midnight, and that 15 degrees next unto it drawn through 75 degrees from the
Center, the hours of 11 and 1, and that which is drawn through 60 degrees from
the Center, the hours of 10 and 2; and so of the rest: let these hour Circles
be pricked to know them from the other Meridians. Then in the Meridian number 23
degrees. 30 minutes, the greatest Declination of the Sun, from the Equator to,
Northward, and to Southward, and draw the line, for the Ecliptique, then
numbering 23 degrees 30 minutes from the North Pole Northward, and from the
South pole Southward, draw the Axes of the Ecliptique, which let be divided in
like sort as the Axis of the World is divided; and through each degree or each
fifth degree, draw-lines parallel to the Ecliptique; these lines so drawn shall
represent the Latitude of the planets, and fixed stars: and for distinction
sake prick every fifth or tenth as before: now if we divide the Ecliptic and
his parallels, as the Equator and his parallels are divided; and then carefully
draw a line through each 30th. degree, so as it makes no Angles; the lines so
drawn shall represent the signs, the first 30 degrees from the Center toward,
shall stand for the sign; the 30 degrees next following for, and so of the
rest, as you may see by the figure.

The Sphere being thus projected in plain, let us resort to the back of our
Quadrat again, and draw a line through the Center, cuiting two of the sides
just in the middle, so shall this Diameter make right Angles with the sides,
and represent the Horizontal line for any Region, then take the just length of
the Semidiameter of your Plainisphere and set it above and below the Horizon at
both ends thereof, in the side of the Quadrat as here you see; and let this
line be divided in like sort as the Equator and his Axis is divided, and
numbered with 10, 20, 30, etc. unto 90 from the Horizon both ways, these are
the degrees of Altitude.

All this being done, let us come to the dividing of the Ecliptique which
incompasseth the Sphere, which may be done out of a Table of Right Ascensions;
for placeing your Sphere upon the Center of the Quadration the back side,
putting some pin through both their Centers, so that they may be kept both at a
stay for slipping one besides the other, then turning the Sphere about, until
the beginning of the hours come to the place where you would have the beginnng
of, and there make stay of it, and mark the beginning of, at the beginning of
the hours: then looking into your Table of Right Ascensions, and see what hour
stands against the beginning of, and you shall find 1 hour 51 min. therefore
number 1 hour 51 min. amongst the hours back-wards toward the left hand, and
there place the beginning of, the like may you do with the rest of the Signs,
and every degree thereof; remembering, that as you numbered the hours toward
the right hand, so must you number the signs toward the left.

Then last of all, prepare a thin narrow slip of Brass, and rivet it on with
the Sphere upon the Quadrat, so that the Sphere may turn about at all times
when need shall require, so likewise let it be riveted to the Quadrat at both
ends, so that the upper edge may be just with the beginning of the degrees of
Altitude; this being thus fastened, shall serve for a Horizon generally for all
Latitudes.

This Horizontall line, must be divided as the Equator and his Axis; so shall
it natural show the Amplitude in all Latitudes.

CHAP. III. How to place the fixed Stars in the Sphere, and also in the outward
Eclipticall Circle, for the speedy finding of the hour of the night in all
Latitudes.
FIrst, you must get both the Right Ascension and Declination, of such Stars as
you intend to place in your Instrument; the finding whereof shall hereafter
appear: these being known; upon the Stars parallel of Declination, seek his
Right Ascension, amongst the Meridians or hour Circles; and at the point of
intersection, betwixt the stars Declination, and Right Ascension, there place
the Star.

As for Example, suppose I would place Arcturus in the Sphere, first, I inquire
his Right Ascension and Declination, either by the propositions hereafter for
that purpose, or by this ensuing Table; and so find his Right Ascension to be
13 hours 59 minutes and his Declination to be 21 degrees 10 minutes North;
therefore upon the 21 parallel and 10 minutes I number 14 hours from unto, and
so back again unto 14, and there I place Arcturus; the like may be done with
any other Star.

Now what Stars you place in the Sphere, the same place in the outward
Ecliptique; which may be done after this manner: enter your Table of Right
Ascensions, with the Right Ascension of the Star, and see what degree of the
Ecliptique answers thereto, and place the Star upon the same.

As for example, the Right Ascension of Arcturus being 14 hours, I enter the
Table of right Ascensions therewith, and I find 2 degrees of, answer
thereunto; therefore Arcturus must be placed at 2 degrees of in the outward
Ecliptique; the like may be done with any other of the fixed Stars.

For readiness sake, I have here inserted a Table of Right Ascensions in
hours and minutes, whereby the outward Ecliptic may be divided, and the stars
therein placed: and also a Table of the Right Ascension, and Declination, and
magnitude, of most of the principal fixed Stars, Rectified for this present
year, 1652

Minutes.

CHAP. IV. To show the General Use of the universal Quadrat.
IN the Use of this Quadrat, let us, for distinction sake, call those Parallels
which make Right Angles with the line whereon the sights stand, Right
Parallels; and the other which Run parallel to the same line, Contrary
Parallels; the one signifying Right shadow, the other Contrary shadow: the
General Use whereof consists in the solution of the Golden Rule, where three
lines or numbers being given of a known denomination, a fourth proportional is
to be found, and this solution is diverse in regard of the signification of
these parallel lines, and also of the entrance into the work.

The signification of these Parallels is sometimes simple, and sometimes
compound, sometimes they signify right lines or numbers only, such as they are
simple in themselves, and sometimes they signify natural sines, which is
half the Chord of the double Arch, and sometimes natural Tangents, which are
perpendiculars at the end of the Diameter: sometimes the work may be begun with
one kind of signification, and ended with another, it may be begun with the
lines as they are in themselves, and ended as they are sines, it may begin as
they are sines, and end as they are Tangents.

The solution in regard of the entrance into the work, may be either right or
contrary. I call that right entrance, or entrance on the Right Parallels, when
the two lines or numbers of the first denomination are applied or found in the
Right parallels, and the third line or number, and that which is sought for, on
the contrary parallels; and on the contrary, I call that contrary entrance,
when the two lines or numbers of the first denomination, are applied or found
on the parallels of contrary shadow, and the third line or number, and that
which is to be found out, in the parallels of right shadow.

As for example, let there be given three numbers 50. 60, and 70. unto which I
am to find a fourth proportional. Let the Question be this, if 50 pounds,
gain 60 shillings what shall 70 pounds gain? here are numbers of two
denominations, one of pounds the other of shillings, and the first with which I
am to enter must be that of 50. pounds. If then I would enter my Question upon
a parallel of right shadow, see where the right Parallel of my first number
which is 50, cutteth the contrary parallel of the second which is 60, and upon
the point of intersection there lay the thread, the thread lying in this
position, look along upon the right Parallel of the third number, which is 70,
and see what contrary parallel cutteth it directly under the thread, for that
is the fourth proportional number required, which here is found to be 84,
wherefore I conclude, that if 50 pounds gain 60 shillings, 70 pounds will
gain 84 shillings; for as 50 is to 60, so is 70 to 84: the like will apeare if
you enter your work upon the contrary parallels, for it mattereth not on which
kind of Parallels you enter, so be it you enter your first and third number on
the same kind of Parallels, so shall the third and fourth be of the other
kind. Thus much for the General Use of this fore-side of the universal
Quadrat, which being considered and well understood, there is nothing hard in
that which follows.

CHAP. V. To divide a line given, into any number of equal parts.
LEt the line given be AB, and let it be required to divide the same into 5
equal parts.

Take with your compasses the given line AB, and lay it down upon any parallel,
whose number may be equally divided into five parts without any remainder; as
lay it upon the fifth parallel, and at the point where the line ends, there
lay the thread; the thread lying in this position, and in regard that 10 is
part of 50, therefore the segment of the tenth parallel which is cut by the
thread, shall be the distance which shall divide the given line into 5 equal
parts.

As for example, take the given line AB, and lay it upon the fiftieth contrary
parallel, as from A to B, and seeing the given line ends in B, lay the thread
upon the same point, as here you see in the following figure; then in regard
that 10 is of 50, therefore I take the segment cut by the thread upon the tenth
parallel, viz. CD, and with it I divide the given line AB, into 5 equal parts
as here you see.

CHAP. VI. To increase a line in a given proportion.
TAke the line given with a pair of Compasses, and lay it one the parallel of
the number given, and upon the point where the given lines ends, there lay
the thread, which being kept in this position, the segment of the parallel, of
the number required, intercepted by the thread, shall give the line required.

diagram of the measurement of proportional lines (A and B)

Let A be a line given to be increased in the proportion of 3 to 5. First, I
take the given line A with my compasses; and in regard that 30 and 50, is the
same with 3 and 5, if from them you give o, therefore I take the given line A,
and lay it upon the thirtieth parallel, as from F to G, in the last Chapter,
and upon I, the point where the line ends, there I lay the thread, which
lying in this position, cutteth the parallel of 50 in the point B; so shall AB,
be the length of the line B, which was required.

CHAP. VII. To diminish a line in a given proportion.
TO diminish a line in a given proportion, is no other then that which was
showed in the last Chapter, but only whereas there you entered with the lesser
line which was to be increased, upon the lesser parallel number; and so the
line required, was found upon the greater parallel number; so here you must
enter with the greater line which is to be diminished, upon the greater
parallel number; and that which is required shall be found upon the lesser
parallel number.

diagram of the measurement of proportional lines (A and B)

Let A be a line given to be diminished in the proportion of 5 to 3, I take the
given line B, and lay it upon the fiftieth parallel, and at the point where the
line ends I lay the thread, as at the point B in the figure of the fifth
Chapter, the thread lying in this position, I see it cut the thirtieth parallel
in the point G, so shall the distance FG, give me the line A, which was
required, and is of the given line B.

Here note that you may use other numbers to work your proportion upon besides
these: for you may multiply or divide the proportional numbers given, either
by 2. 3, or 4, etc. and so work by their numbers: as for 3 and 5 we may work
by 6 and 10, or else by 9 and 15, or by 12 and 20, or 15 and 25, or 18 and 30,
or 24 and 40, or 30 and 50, as here we have done.

CHAP. VIII. To find a proportion betwixt two or more Right lines.
TAke the greater line betwixt your Compasses, and extend it upon that
parallel, whose number you intend to make the denominator of the fraction; at
the end of which extent place the thread; the thread resting in this position,
take the lesser line betwixt your Compasses, and (keeping one foot in the side
of your Quadrat,) carry it parallel unto tthe greater line, until the other
foot touch the thread, which you may very well do by help of the parallels; so
shall the number of that parallel whereon the Compasses shall stay, be the
Numerator to the former Denominator.

diagram of the measurement of proportional lines (AB and CD)

Let the lines given be AB, and CD, first, I take the line CD, and place it
upon the fiftieth parallel, as from A to B, upon which point B, I lay the
thread; which being kept in this position, I take the lesser line AB betwixt my
Compasses, and keeping one foot in the side of the Quadrat EH, I carry them
parallel to the greater line, until the other foot touches the thread at G;
so shall the fixed foot rest in the parallel of 30, which is the Numerator to
the former Denominator, wherefore I conclude that the line AB is 30/50 or of
the line CD, or the line AB, is in such proportion to the line CD, as 30 to 50,
which was required.

But if the line CD, be greater then these parallels can contain, take thereof,
and enter with the same as before you did with the whole line; so likewise take
the lesser line and carry it parallel as before you did the whole line, and you
shall produce the same proportion as before.

CHAP. IX. To lay down suddenly 2, 3, or more Right lines in any proportion
required.
FIrst, lay your thread by chance upon the Quadrat, so as it may cut the
parallels of all the numbers given: so shall the thread cut off from each
parallel, the proportional lines required: which may be taken with your
Compasses, and laid down presently.

As for Example, let it be required to lay down four straight lines, which
shall bear such proportion one to the other as four given numbers; which let
be these 60, 50, 30, 10. then opening the thread by chance, so as it may cut
the parallels of all these given numbers: so shall the thread cut from each
parallel, the proportional line required; which you may take from your
Quadrat, and lay them down as here you see; viz. from the parallel of 60, the
line KL, from the parallel of 50, the line AB, from the parallel of 30, the
line FG; and from the parallel 10, the line CD.

diagram of the measurement of proportional lines (CD, FG, AB, and KL)

CHAP. X. Having two lines given, to find a third proportional line to them.
FIrst, place both the lines given on the contrary side of the Quadrat, and
mark how many parallels of contrary shadow they do extend unto; then take the
second line again, and place it upon the right side of the Quadrat, and note
the extension amongst the parallels of right shadow; now see where the contrary
parallel of the first line, cutteth the right parallel of the second line, and
there lay the thread; the thread lying in this position, see what right
parallel is cut by the contrary parallel of the second line, directly under the
thread, for that is the third proportional line required.

diagram of the measurement of proportional lines (EO, OF, and FG)

Let the two lines given be EO, and OF, and it is required to find a third
line, which shall be in such proportion to OF, as OF is to EO: first, place the
two lines upon the contrary side of the Quadrat, and you shall find the line
EO, to extend unto 20, and OF unto 30, now extend OF on the right parallels
also, which will be likewise unto 30; therefore where the contrary parallel of
EO 20, cutteth the right parallel of OF 30, there lay the thread as at P, the
thread lying still in this position I see where the contrary parallel of OF 30,
cutteth the thread, which is at G, upon the right parallel of 45: therefore FG
shall be the third proportional line required: and shall be 45 of such
divisions as EO is 20, and OF 30.

To perform the same more speedily with the numbers, for as 20, is to 30; so
is 30, to a third number.

Therefore, at the intersection of the twentieth contrary parallel, with the
thirtieth right parallel, there lay the thread, which being kept in this
position, see where the thirtieth contrary parallel cutteth the thread, which
will be at G, upon the 45 parallel of right shadow, which 45. is the third
proportional number as before.

CHAP. XI. Having three lines given to find a fourth proportional to them.
HEre the first line and the third, are to be placed on the contrary parallels;
and the second on the right parallels: therefore, at the intersection of the
contrary parallel of the first line, with the right parallel of the second,
there lay the thread; the thread lying still in this position, whese the
contrary parallel of the third line cutteth the thread, there is the right
parallel of the fourth proportional line.

diagram of the measurement of proportional lines (EO, OP, EK, and KL)

Let the three lines given be EO, OP, and EK, and let it be required to find a
fourth line, which shall have such proportion to EK, as OP, has to EO. First,
therefore I place EO, upon the contrary parallels, and it extends unto 20, so
likewise EK; being extended upon the same parallels reaches unto 60, now OP,
being extended upon the right parallels gives 30, therefore at the
intersection of the twentieth contrary parallel, with the right parallel of 30,
I lay the thread, as at P; the thread lying in this position, I see where the
60 contrary parallel cutteth it, and I find it to be at L, upon the right
parallel of 90; so shall the distance KL, be the fourth proportionaull line
required; and will be found to be 90 such parts, as EK is 60, or OP, 30.

If at any time your lines or numbers; out run the limits of your Quadrat; you
may take,,, or 1/10, or any other parts of your first and third lines or
numbers; and keeping the second whole; you shall have the fourth number whole
also, or you may keep your first and third numbers whole, and take,,, or 1/10,
or any other parts, of your second; so shall you have the like part of your
fourth number, or if this will not please, you may take what part you please,
of all three of your given lines or numbers; so shall you have the like part of
your fourth number.

Or if your numbers or lines be too small, that they fall to near the center,
you may increase them in the like manner.

This is in effect, to alter the number of parallels upon the Quadrat,
according as need shall require, for they being actually divided into 100 equal
parts; if you shall take away (by supposition) the cipher from each tenth
parallel, they will become only 10 parallels, and if you shall (by supposition)
add a cipher to each tenth parallel, you shall make each parallel to signify
10, and every tenth to signify 100, and so the whole side to be 1000. thus you
see you may either increase them, or diminish them, according to any proportion
required which being well considered, will be a great help in this work of
right lines: and for the rest which follows we shall have no such need.

CHAP. XII. To find a mean proportional line between two right lines given.
A mean proportional line is that, whose square is equal to the long square,
contained under his two extremes.

First, join the two given lines together, so as they may make both one right
line; the which divide into two equal parts; then take the distance between
the point of meeting, and the middle of the line; and place it from the center
of your Quadrat, a long upon one of the sides; then take one half of the line
betwixt your Compasses, and setting one foot thereof in the point where the
former line ended, with the other touch the other side of the Quadrat; from
which point to the center, shall be the length of the mean proportional line
required.

diagram of the measurement of lines A, B, CE, and D

Let A and B be be two lines given, between which it is required to find a
mean proportional line: first join the two lines togther in F, so as they may
make the right line CE, which divide into two equal parts in the point G; then
take with your Compasses the distance FG, and place it upon the side of the
Quadrat, from the center E unto N, as in the figure of the fifth Chapter; then
take one half of the former joined line, and setting one foot in the point N,
with the other, touch the other side of the Quadrat, as at m: so shall the
distance betwixt the center E and the point m, be the line D, which is the
mean proportional line required, betwixt the two extremes A and B.

To perform the some with numbers.
Let 48 and 27, be two given numbers, between which it is required to find a
mean proportional number: first, add the two given numbers together, and
they will make 75, then take the half thereof which is 37, out of which half
take the lesser extreme, and there will remain 10, now therefore take 37
divisions betwixt your Compasses, and setting one foot in 10 counted on the
right side of the Quadrat, as at n, with the other foot touch the contrary
side, as at m, which will be at 36, so shall 36 be the mean proportional
number between 48 and 27, as was required.

Or in stead of the Compasses you may make use of the bead, for if you lay the
thread upon the side of the Quadrat, and set the bead to 37 of the contrary
parallels, which being fixed, open the thread until the bead falls upon 10
of the right parallel, and there it shall show amongst the contrary parallels,
the mean proportional number to be 36, as before.

CHAP. XIII. To find the square Root of a number given.
FOr the performing of this, it were best to divide the given number, by some
other number as you shall see cause, or like best of; but if it may be, let it
be such a number as may divide your given number without leaving a fraction, so
shall your divisor be your lesser extreme, and your quotient the greater; this
being done, you may find a mean between these two extremes, by the last
Chapter, which mean proportional number, shall be the square root of your
given number.

As for example, let the number given be 1296, and let it be required to find
the square root thereof, first, divide the given number by some other number,
that will divide it equally without a fraction if you can; as here we will
divide the given number 1296 by 9, the quotient will be 144, for the greater
extreme, and 9 shall be the lesser; now add the two extremes together and
they will make 153, the half whereof is 76, unto which number (counted on the
side of the Quadrat) place the bead; then take 9 the lesser extreme, out of 76,
and there will rest 67, therefore open the thread until the bead falls upon
the right parallel of 67, and there you shall see it cut the contrary parallel
of 36; wherefore I conclude the root of 1296 is 36, the thing which was
required.

CHAP. XIV. To divide a line by extreme and mean proportion.
LEt the line AB be a line given to be so divided, first, take the given line
AB betwixt your Compasses, and setting one foot in the Center E, of the fifth
Chapter, extend the other upon the side of the Quadrat, and see what parallel
it reaches unto, as here unto 60 at K; and mark the intersection of this
parallel with his like, as at S; then take half the given line, and place it
on the same side of the Quadrat, from the point where the whole line ended at
K, unto R; then in the point R set one foot of your Compasses, and with the
distance RS, make a mark in the side of your Quadrat, as at O; so shall your
given line AB, be divided in the point O, by extreme and mean proportion;
which proportion is after this manner.

As the lesser segment thereof, is to the greater; so is the greater, to the
whole line; and thus OB the lesser segment of the given line AB, is to the
greater segment OA, as the greater segment OA is to the whole line AB, which
was required

diagram of the division of lines (AB, C, D, and FG)

CHAP. XV. Having either the greater or lesser segment, of a line divided by
extreme and mean proportion, to find the other segment, and so consequently
the whole line.
FIrst by the last Chapter, divide any line by extreme and mean proportion,
as here the line AB; then let the line C be the greater segment of a line so
divided, and it is required to find the lesser segment thereof;

Therefore having divided the line AB in the same manner, the proportion will
hold. As the greater segment OA, To the lesser segment OB; So is the greater
segment the line C, To his lesser segment the line D.
Which two segments C and D, being joined together in the point E, shall make
up the whole line FG, whereof OF is the lesser segment, and EG the greater,
which was required; and in the like manner, having the lesser segment of a line
divided by extreme and mean proportion, you may find the greater, behold the
lines in the foregoing Chapter.

CHAP. XVI. To divide a right line given in power, according to any proportion
required.
TO divide a line in power, is to find two other lines, whose squares together
shall be equal to the square of the given line; but the square of the one, to
the square of the other, to be in any proportion required.

First by the seventh Chapter divide the given line according to the proportion
given; and then by the twelfth Chapter find two mean proportionalls between
each part and the whole line; which two proportionalls together shall be equal
in power to the given line; and the power of the one, to the power of the
other, according to the proportion given, shall be proportional.

diagram of the division of lines (AB, C, and D)

Let the line AB be a line to be so divided, as the side of some square which
is 75; and let the proportion given be as 16 to 9. First by the eleventh
Chapter divide the given line AB, proportionally as 16 to 9, which will be in
the point E, making AE, 48, and BE 27: now by the twelfth Chapter finding a
mean proportional number between 48, the segment AE, and 75 the whole line,
you shall produce 60 the line C: so likewise a mean proportional between 27
the segment BE, and 75 the whole line, shall be 45 the line D.

Wherefore the square of 60, the line C; put to the square of 45, the line D;
shall be equal to the square of 75, the given line AB; and yet the square of
C, shall be in such proportion to the square of D, as 16 is to 9, which was
required.

CHAP. XVII. To augment a superficies in a given proportion.
TO augment a superficies in a proportion given, is to find a line; upon which
if you make a superficies like unto that which was given, they shall be in such
proportion one to the other, like unto the proportion given.

First, therefore by the sixth Chapter increase the side of the given
superficies, according to the proportion given; then find a mean
proportional line (by the twelfth Chapter) between the given side of the
superficies, and the line so increased; upon which if you make the like
superficies, it shall be in such proportion to the given superficies, as was
required.

diagram of the measurement of a superficies (A, B, and C)

Let the line A, be the side of a square to be augmented in the proportion of
16 to 25. First, by the sixth Chapter increase 48 the given side A, in the
proportion of 16 to 25; so shall you find 75 for the length of the line B: now
between 48 the given side A, and 75 the increased line B, find a mean
proportional, which will be 60 the line C: upon which if you make a square, it
shall bear such proportion to the square of A, as 25 to 16, as was required.
For as 16, is to 25: So is 2384 the square of 48, the given side A, To the
square of 60 which is 3600, the required square made upon the line B.


CHAP. XVIII. To diminish a superficies in a given proportion.
TO diminish a superficies in a proportion given, is to find out a line, upon
which if you make a superficies like unto that which was given, it shall be
less then it according to the proportion given.

First, therefore by the seventh Chapter diminish the side of the given
superficies, according to the proportion given; then by the twelfth Chapter
find a mean proportional between the side of the given superficies, and the
line so diminished, which shall be the like side of the superficies required.

As for example, let the line B in the foregoing Chapter be the Diameter of a
circle to be diminished in the proportion of 25 unto 16. First, by the seventh
Chapter, diminish 75 the given diameter B, in the proportion of 25 unto 16, so
shall you produce 48 for the length of the diminished line A: now between 75
the given diameter B, and 48 the diminished line A, find a mean
proportional, which will be 60 the length of the line C: upon which diameter
if you describe a circle it will be less then the Circle made upon the
diameter B, in such proportion as 16 is less then 25, which was required.

For as 25 is to 16; so is 4419 9/14 the content of the given circle whose
diameter is the line B, to the content of the circle required (whose Diameter
is the line C,) which is 2828 4/7

CHAP. XIX. To find the perpendicular of an equilater Triangle, the sides
thereof being given.
AN equilater Triangle is that, which has all his three sides equal; for I
need not stand to define what a Triangle is, seeing it is so well known to be
a figure made of three lines, either Right or Sphericall, but here I speak of
Right lined Triangles. Now to find the length of the perpendicular, which is a
line falling from the opposite angle to the base, making Right Angles
therewith; lay the thread upon the side of the Quadrat, and rectify the bead
to the length of one of the sides; then opening the thread, until the bead
fall upon the right parallel of half the base; so shall it show the contrary
parallel of the perpendicular.

diagram of the measurement of an equilateral triangle (ABC)

Let the Triangle ABC, be given, wherein it is required to since the length of
the perpendicular AD: First, lay the thread upon the side of the Quadrat, and
rectify the bead to 8 the length of the side AB, or AC; then open the thread,
until the bead falls upon the Right parallel of 4, the one half of the base
BC, which is BD, or CD; so shall the bead cut the contrary parallel of 6 9/10
which is the length of the perpendicular AD, which was required.

Thus may you likewise find the perpendicular of an Isoscheles Triangle, which
is a Triangle of two equal sides; for, first placing the bead to one of the
sides, then opening the thread until the bead fall on the Right parallel of
one half of the base; so shall it show the contrary parallel of the
perpendicular.

CHAP. XX. How speedily to find the perpendicular of a Right Angled Triangle,
the sides being given; as also to find the segments of the base, cut by the
perpendicular.
A Right angled Triangle, is that whose sides comprehending the Right angle
falls square or perpendicularly one upon the other, thereby making the Angle
contained betwixt them a Right Angle, or an Angle of 90 degrees.

To find the perpendicular of such a Triangle, lay the thread upon the side of
the Quadrat, and rectify the bead to the lesser side of the Triangle given,
then open the thread to the intersection of the contrary parallel of the
greater side, with the Right Parallel of the lesser side; so shall the bead
show the contrary parallel of the perpendicular required.

diagram of the measurement of a right-angled triangle (ABC)

Let the Triangle ABC, be a right angled Triangle given, whose perpendicular is
required. First, laying the thread upon the side of the Quadrat, rectify the
bead to 45 the lesser side BC, of the given Triangle ABC; then opening the
thread to the point of intersection, betwixt the contrary parallel of 60 the
greater side AB, and the Right Parallel of 45 the lesser side BC; the thread
lying upon this point you shall see it cut the contrary parallel of 36, which
is the length of the perpendicular BD, which was required.

Or the bead being fixed as before, if you open the thread to the point of
intersection, betwixt the contrary parallel of the lesser side BC, 45, and the
right parallel of the greater side AB, 60; the bead shall fall upon the right
parallel of 36, which is the length of the perpendicular BD as before: or
having two beads upon your thread, if you place the one to 45 the lesser side,
and the other to 60 the greater side; and opening the thread as before, unto
the point of intersection, betwixt the contrary parallel of 60 the greater
side, and the right parallel of 45 the lesser side; the thread lying in this
position, the bead which signifies the greater side, shall show the right
parallel of 36, and the other bead shall show the contrary parallel of the
same, which is the perpendicular BD, as before.

And farther, the thread and beads lying still in this position, the bead which
signifies the greater side 60, shall cut the contrary parallel of 48, which
shall be the greater segment of the base divided by the perpendicular, viz. AD;
and the bead which signifies the lesser side 45, shall cut the right parallel
of 27, which is the lesser segment of the base, viz. CD.

CHAP. XXI. To find the perpendicular of any Triangle, the three sides being
given.
FIrst, for this purpose lay the thread upon the side of the Quadrat, and
rectify the bead to the first side, then take the second side with your
Compasses, and setting one foot in the end of the third side, open the three
until the moving foot of your Compasses, and the bead rest directly both at a
point; so shall that parallel, which passes by the point where the Compass
foot, and the bead meets, (parallel to the side wherein the other foot of the
Compasses stands) be the perpendicular required. As for Example; let it be
required to find the perpendicular of the Triangle in the last Chapter. First,
lay the thread to the side of the quadrat, and rectify the bead to the greater
side AB, which is 60; then take 45 betwixt your Compasses, which is the lesser
side BC, and setting one foot in the side of the Quadrat in 75, which is the
base AC, with the other open the thread, until the point of the Compasses and
the bead meet both in one point; so shall the parallel distance, betwixt the
bead and that side of the Quadrat wherein the foot of the Compasses stands,
be 36, the perpendicular required.

CHAP. XXII. To find a proportion between two or more like superficies.
FIrst, place the thread upon the side of the Quadrat, then rectify the beads,
one to the one given side, and the other to the other given side, then at the
point of intersection betwixt the greater sides contrary parallel, with the
right parallel of the lesser side, there lay the thread; the thread lying in
this position, the bead which signifies the greater side, shall cut the
contrary parallel of the greater terms required, and the other bead which
signifies the lesser side given, shall cut the right parallel of the lesser
term required, which two terms or numbers shall bear such proportion the one
to the other as the two given sides, which was required.

diagram of the measurement of proportional lines (A and B)

Let A and B, be two sides of like superficies, as the sides of two squares, or
the Diameters of two Circles; the side A being 45, and the side B 60; First
therefore, lay the thread upon the side of the Quadrat, and rectify the beads
one to 45, and the other to 60, then at the point where the contrary parallel
of 60, intersecteth the right parallel of 45, there lay the thread, the thread
lying in this position, the bead for 60, shall cut the contrary parallel of 48,
and the bead for 45 shall cut the right parallel of 27, these two numbers viz.
48, and 27, shall be in such proportion one to the other, as the two given
superficies, wherefore the proportion of the superficies, whose side is B, to
that whose side is A, is as 48 to 27, which is in lesser terms, as 16 to 9.

CHAP. XXIII. Two Geometrical Squares being given, to add them together into
one Square, and also to add two circles together into one circle.
FIrst, from the center of your Quadrat, lay or count the two sides of the
given squares, one upon the one side, and the other upon the other side of the
Quadrat; then setting one foot of your Compasses, in the extreme point of one
of the given sides extend the other foot to the extreme point of the other
given side; so shall you have betwixt your Compasses, a third side which shall
make a square, equal to both the given squares. Note, what is said here of
the sides of squares, the like may be understood of the Diameters of Circles.

diagram of the measurement of proportional lines (A, B, and C)

Let the two lines A and B be the sides of two given squares, and let it be
required to add them together into one square, or to make a third square
equal to them both: seeing the side A is 45, and the side B 60, therefore I
set one foot of my Compasses in 60 upon one side of my Quadrat, and extend the
other unto 45 upon the other side of my Quadrat, so shall I have betwixt my
Compasses the line C, which being applied to the side of the Quadrat gives 75,
upon which line C, if I make a square, it will be equal to both the squares of
A and B, which was required.

And what is said here of the sides of squares may be understood of the
Diameters of circles: for if these three lines A, B and C, shall be the
Diameters of three circles, the circle described upon the Diameter C, shall be
equal to the two other circles, described upon the Diameters A and B.

And thus you may add diverse squares or circles together into one square or
circle; if you add first two into one, and then unto that a third, and then
unto the total a fourth, and so on at pleasure.

CHAP. XXIIII. Two squares or Circles being given, to substract the one out of
the other, and to produce the remainder in a third square.
FIrst, take betwixt your Compasses the side of the greater square given, and
setting one foot in the side of the lesser given square, (counted on the side
of the Quadrat) with the other foot cut the other side of the Quadrat; and
where the Compasses so cutteth, there is the side of the remaining square,
counted, from the center.

diagram of the measurement of proportional lines (A, B, and C)

Let the two lines B and C be the sides of two squares, or the Diameters of two
circles; and it is required to substract the square of B, out of the square of
C, and to make a square equal to the remainder. First, I take 75 the line C
(which is the side of the greater square,) betwixt my Compasses, and setting
one foot in 60 the side of the lesser square, (counted on the side of the
Quadrat) the other foot will reach unto 45, upon the other side of the Quadrat;
which 45 is the length of the line A, the side of the remaining square upon
which if you make a square, it shall be equal to the remainder of the greater
given square, when the lesser is taken out of the same, as was required.

CHAP. XXV. To make a square equal to any superficies given.
IF the superficies given be a rectangle parallelogram, a mean proportional
line betwixt the two unequal sides, shall be the side of his equal square.

If it shall be a Triangle, a mean proportional between the perpendicular
and half the base, shall be the side of his equal square.

If it be a Rombus, or Romboydes, a mean proportional between one of his
sides, and the parallel distance of the same sides, shall be the side of his
equal square

If it shall be any other right-lined figure, it may be resolved into
Triangles, and so a side of a square found equal to every Triangle; and these
being reduced into one equal square it shall be equal to the whole
right-lined figure given.

And if the superficies given be a circle, a mean proportional between the
semidiameter and semi-circumference, or betwixt the diameter and of the
circumference, shall be the side of his equal square.

CHAP. XVI. Having the length and breadth of an oblong superficies given in
perches, to find the content in acres.
IN every parallelogram right angled, the length in perches, multiplied by the
breadth in perches, and the product divided by 160, the number of perches in an
acre, produces the content; therefore, As 160, to the breadth in perches: So
the length in perches, to the content in acres.


Here and in such like propositions, you may suppose one side of your Quadrat
to be 1000; so shall every parallel signify 10, and the other side may rest as
it is actually divided into 100; as you may perceive by the 11th, Chapter.

This being presupposed, at the intersection of the contrary parallel of 160,
with the right parallel of the breadth, there lay the thread; so shall the
contrary parallel of the length, cut the thread at the right parallel of the
content.

diagram of the measurement of an oblong or rectangle (ABCD)

Let the plane given to be measured be ABCD, the length thereof being 50
perches, and the breadth 25 perches: now lay the thread upon the intersection
of the contrary parallel of 160, with the right parallel of 25 so shall it cut
the contrary parallel of 50, at the right parallel of 8, which is the number of
acres contained in the long square ABCD, as was required.

CHAP. XXVII. Having the length and breadth of an oblong superficies given in
Chains, to find the content in acres,
HEre we will suppose each Chain to contain four perches in length, and the
whole Chain to be divided into 100 equal links, according to Gunters
description: and this Chain as it is most easy by Arithmetique, so is it also
by this Instrument, for whereas by perches we turned one side of our Quadrat
into 1000, we may here for the most part turn each side into 20, so shall every
(...) parallel signify an unite, and the proportion will be this. As 10, to
the breadth in Chains; So the length in Chains, To the content in acres.


And thus in the former plane ABCD, the breadth being 6 Chains 40 links, and
the length 12 Chains 50 links; if I lay the thread upon the contrary parallel
of 10, at the intersection with the right parallel of 6 Chains 40 links; it
shall cut the contrary parallel of 12 Chains 50 links, at the right parallel of
8 the content in acres, as before.

CHAP. XXVIII. The perpendicplar and base of a Triangle being given in perches,
to find the content in acres.
ALL Triangles of what kind soever, are equal in their superficial content,
unto half that right angled parallelogram, whose length and breadth is equal
to the perpendicular, and the side whereon it falls, as the Triangle CED, in
the 26 th. Chapter is one half of the long square ABCD, whose content was
found as before. Or thus without halfing. As 320, to the perpendicular in
perches: So the base in perches to the content in acres.


Thus in the former Triangle CED, the perpendicular being 25 perches, and the
base 50 perches, if you lay the thread upon the intersection of the contrary
parallel of 320, with the right parallel of 25, you shall see it cut the
contrary parallel of 50 at the right parallel of 4, and so many acres is in the
Triangle CED, the thing required.

CHAP. XXIX. Having the perpendicular and base of a Triangle, given in Chains,
to find the content in acres
AS 20, to the perpendicular in Chains: So the base in chains, to the content
in acres.
And so in the former Triangle CED, in the 26th. Chapter the perpendicular OF
being 6 Chains 40 links, and the base CD 12 Chains 50 links; if I place the
thread upon the intersection of the right parallel of 6 Chains 40 links with
the contrary parallel of 20, it shall cut the contrary parallel of 12 Chains 50
links, at the right parallel of 4, the content of the Triangle CED, as before.

CHAP. XXX. Having the content of a superficies after one kind of perch, to
find the content of the same superficies according to another kind of perch.
AS the length of the second perch, To the content in acres: So the length of
the first perch, To a fourth number; And that fourth number, To the content in
acres required.
Suppose the plane ABCD measured with a Statute perch of 16 feet, contained 8
acres; and it were demanded how many acres it would contain if it were measured
with a Chain of 18 foot to the perch: these kind of propositions are wrought
by the backward Rule of three, after a duplicated proportion. But by exchanging
the places of the first and third numbers, by putting each in others place, it
will become the forward Rule of three, and may be resolved after this manner.
Place the thread upon the intersection of the contrary parallel of 18, with the
right parallel of 8, and it will cut the contrary parallel of 16 at the right
parallel of 7 33/100, now where this right parallel of 7 33/100, crosses the
former contrary parallel of 18, there lay the thread again, so shall it cut
the contrary parallel of 16 at the right parallel of 6 72/100, which shows the
content to be 6 acres 72 parts (such as 100 makes an acre) measured by an 18
foot pole.

CHAP. XXXI. Having the plot of a plain with the content in acres, to find the
scale by which it was plotted.
SUppose the plane ABCD in the twenty sixth Chapter contained just 8 acres, if I
should measure it with a scale of 12 in an inch; the length AB would be 60
pole, and the breadth AD 30 18/25 pole; and the content would be found by the
16 Chapter to be about 11 acres where it should be but 8 acres. Therefore by
the twelfth Chapter find a mean proportional number between 8 and 11, which
will be about 9 and something better. Then will the proportion hold. As this
mean proportional, To the scale you measured by; So the content of the plot,
To the scale by which it was plotted.


Wherefore I place the thread upon the intersection of the contrary parallel of
9, with the right parallel of 12; so shall I see it cut the contrary parallel
of 8, at the right parallel of 10; which 10 is the scale by which it was
plotted.

CHAP. XXXII. Having the length of the furlong given in perches, to find the
breadth of the acre in perches.
AS the length in perches unto 40: So is 4, to the breadth in perches.
So the length of the furlong being 20 perches, I lay the thread at the
intersection of the contrary parallel of 20, with the right parallel of 40, so
will it cut the contrary parallel of 4; at the right parallel of 8, which is
the breadth of the acre given, if the length had been 30, the breadth would
have been 5, and so of the rest.

CHAP. XXXIV. Having the length of the furlong given in Chains, to find the
breadth of the acre in Chains.
AS the length in Chains unto 5; So is 2, to the breadth in Chain measure.
So the length of the furlong being 4 Chains, lay the thread upon the
intersection of the contrary parallel of 4, with the right parallel of 5, so
shall it cut the contrary parallel of 2, at the right parallel of 2 Chains 50
links, and such is the breadth required.

CHAP. XXXIV. Having the breadth of any Board given in inches, and the length in
feet, to find the content in feet.
AS 12 inches, to the breadth in inches: So the length in feet, to the content
in feet.
Thus in the figure A, the length being 10 foot, and the breadth 16 inches; If
I place the thread at the intersection of the contrary parallel of 12, with the
right parallel of 16, it will cut the contrary parallel of 10, at the right
parallel of 13, and so many square feet is in that board noted with the let A.

diagram of the measurement of a board

CHAP. XXXV. Having the breadth of any board given in inches, to find the
length of a foot superficial in inch measure.
AS the breadth of the board given in inches, Is to 12 inches: So is 12 inches,
To the length of a foot in inch measure.
Thus in the figure A of the last Chapter, being a board whose breadth is 16
inches; if I place the thread at the intersection of the contrary parallel of
16, with the right parallel of 12, it will cut the contrary parallel of 12, at
the right parallel of 9, and such is the length of a foot of that board, whose
breadth is 16 inches.

CHAP. XXXVI. How to measure board which is taper grown, or wider at one end
then at the other.
FIrst, add the breadth at both ends together, and take the one half thereof
for a mean breadth; then say as in the 35 Chapter. As 12 inches, to this mean
breadth in inches: So the length in feet, to the content in feet.


As for example, let this figure B be a tapering board to be measured, whose
length is 21 foot, and let the breadth at one end be 18 inches, and at the
other 14, now adding 14 to 18, the sum will be 32, the half whereof is 16
inches for a mean breadth; then if you apply the thread to the contrary
parallel of 12, with the right parallel of 16; it will cut the contrary
parallel of 21, at the right parallel of 28, and so many square feet of flat
measure, is contained in this tapering board.

diagram of the measurement of a board

CHAP. XXXVII. Having the Circumference of a circle, to find the Diameter.
AS 22 is to 7, So is the circumference to the Diameter.
Thus in the following Circle A, the Circumference being 81 5/7, if I place the
thread at the intersection of the contrary parallel of 22, with the right
parallel of 81 5/7, it will cut the contrary parallel of 7, at the right
parallel of 26, and such is the Diameter BC as was required.

CHAP. XXXVIII. Having the Diameter of a circle, to find the circumference.
AS 7 is to 22: So is the Diameter to the Circumference.
Thus in this circle A, the Diameter being 26, if I place the thread to the
intersection of the contrary parallel of 7, with the right parallel of 26, it
will cut the contrary parallel of 22, at the right parallel of 81 5/7, and such
is the circumference required.

diagram of the measurement of a circle

CHAP. XXXIX. Having the chord of any arch, with the perpendicular falling from
the middle of the said arch to the chord, to find the Diameter.
AS the perpendicular, to half the chord line: So is half the said chord, to
a fourth line or number.
Which being added to the aforesaid perpendicular, gives the Diameter required.

Thus in the segment FEGH in the former circle, having the perpendicular or
versed sine EH, 8, and the chord FG, 24, the half whereof is 12, the line GH,
we may find the Diameter: for if we place the thread upon the intersection of
the contrary parallel of 8, with the right parallel of 12; it will cut the
contrary parallel of 12, at the right parallel of 18, unto which if you add 8,
you shall have 26 for the whole Diameter DE as was required.

CHAP. XL. Having the circumference and Diameter of a circle given in inches,
to find the superficial content in feet.
EVery circle is near equal to that right angled Triangle, of whose
containing sides the one is equal to the Semidiameter, the other to the
Circumference.

Or to that right angled parallelogram, whose breadth is equal to the
Semidiameter, and length to the Semicircumference.

Or else to that right angled parallelogram, whose breadth is equal to the
Diameter, and length to the one quarter of the Circumference. Or breadth equal
to the one quarter of the circumference, and length to the Diameter; which is
all one. Wherefore, As 144 inches, to the Diameter in inches: So one quarter of
the circumference in inches, To the content in feet.


Thus in the former circle BECD, having the Diameter BC 26 inches, and one
quarter of the circumference BD or CD 20 3/7 inches, we may find the content
in feet; for if we place the thread at the intersection of the contrary
parallel of 144, with the right parallel of 26; it will cut the contrary
parallel of 20 ^, at the right parallel of 3 5/8 and something more, and such
is the content superficial in foot measure, as was required.

CHAP. XLI. To find the superficial content of any part or segment of a
circle:
EVery part of a circle, whether it be semicircle, Quadrant, or any other
sector of a circle, is near equal to that right angled parallelogram or long
square, whose length and breadth is, the one equal to the semidiameter, the
other to the one half of the arch line, or to the whole Diameter, and one
quarter of the arch line. And therefore may be measured by the 26, or 27, or by
this last Chapter.

For if you would measure the semicircle ABDC in the 39 Chapter you may take
the semidiameter AB, or AC for your breadth, and the one half of his arch line
BDC, which is BD, or CD 20 3/7 for your length.

Or if you would measure the Quadrant ABD, you may take the semidiameter 13 for
your length, and half the arch BD 10 3/14 for your breadth: the like holds
for any sector of a circle whatsoever.

But if you would measure the segment FDGH, you must first measure the plain of
AFDGA, by the former rules, and then the Triangle AGF by the 28 or 29 Chapter
or by the 41 Chapter, taking the perpendicular for the breadth, and half the
base for the length of a right angled parallelogram; the content of which
Triangle being added to the content of AFDGA, gives the content of the segment
FDGH.

And if you would measure the segment FGE, you must first measure the sector
EGAF, and from the content take the content of the Triangle AFG, so shall the
remainder be the content of the segment FGE, as was required.

CHAP. XLII. Having the circumference of a circle, to find the side of a square
equal to the same circle.
AS 1000 to the circumference: So is 282 to the side of the square.
Thus in the circle of the 38 Chapter, having the circumference 81 5/7, we may
find the side of a square equal thereunto.

For if we apply the thread to the intersection of the contrary parallel of
1000, with the right parallel of 282, it will cut the contrary parallel of 81
5/7, at the right parallel of 23 43/1000, and such is the side of that square,
which is equal to the same circle.

CHAP. LXIII. Having the diameter of a circle, to find the side of a square
equal to the same circle.
AS 1000, to the diameter; So is 886, to the side of the square
Thus in the circle of the 38 Chapter, having the Diameter 26 inches, we may
find the side of a square equal thereunto.

For if we place the thread upon the intersection of the contrary parallel of
1000, with the right parallel of 886; it will cut the contrary parallel of 26,
at the right parallel of 23 43/100, and such is the side of the square required.

CHAP. XLIV. Having the breadth and depth of a squared solid given in inches,
and the length in feet, to find the content in feet.
AS 12 inches, is to the breadth in inches: So is the length in feet, to the
superficial content of that same side in feet.
Then again, As 12 inches, is to the depth in inches: So is this superficial
content, to the solid content in feet.


As for example, let the figure A be a squared piece of timber to be measured;
whose breadth is 18 inches, and depth 14, and let the length thereof be 10
foot, then for to find the solid content.

diagram of the measurement of a block

First place the thread to the intersection of the contrary parallel of 12,
with the right parallel of 18; and it shall cut the contrary parallel of 10, at
the right parallel of 15, and so many feet of flat measure is contained in the
broadest side.

Then look where this right parallel of 15, intersecteth the contrary parallel
of 12, and there place the thread again, so shall it cut the contrary parallel
of 14, at the right parallel of 17 feet, and so many Cubicall feet is contained
in this piece of squared Timber, noted with the letter A.

CHAP. XLV. Having the breadth and depth of a squared solid given in inches, to
find the length of a foot solid in inch measure.
AS the breadth in inches, Is to 12 inches; So is 12 inches, To a fourth number.
Which is the length of a foot superficial at the breadth given then. As the
depth in inches, Is to 12 inches: So is this fourth number, To the length of a
foot solid.


Thus in the squared piece of Timber in the last Chapter having the breadth 18
inches, and the depth 14 inches, we may find how many inches in length will
make a foot solid of that piece.

For if we place the thread to the intersection of the contrary parallel of 18,
with the right parallel of 12; it will cut the contrary parallel of 12, at the
right parallel of 8: and such is the length of a foot superficial, the breadth
being 18 inches. Then again place the thread to the intersection of the
contrary parallel of 14, with the right parallel of 12; and it will cut the
contrary parallel of this 8, at the right parallel of 6 ^; and so many inches
in length will make a foot solid, of that piece whose breadth is 18 inches, and
depth 14.

Having in this Chapter showed how you may by the Universal Quadrat, measure
any squared solid or prisma, whose bases or ends are equal, like and parallel:
I will now in some Chapters following, show how to reduce any prisma (of what
fashion soever the base or end thereof be,) into a squared solid, and so by
this Chapter to measure all manner of prisma's, or all manner of Timber and
Stone, whose bases or ends are equal, like and parallel.

CHAP. XLVI How that prisma or piece of Timber, whose base or end is a
Triangle, may be measured.
ALL Triangles being equal in their superficial content, to half that right
angled parallelogram, whose length and breadth is the one equal to the
perpendicular, and the other to the side whereon it falls, as was showed in
the 28 Chapter; therefore if we take either half the perpendicular and the
whole base, or the whole perpendicular and half the base whereon it falls,
the one for the breadth, and the other for the depth of a squared solid, we may
measure it in all respects according to the 44 Chapter and that to any length
required.

diagram of the measurement of a triangle (BCD)

As for example, let the Triangle BCD be the base of a prisma or piece of
Timber to be measured, now taking 10 the whole perpendicular AB for the
breadth, and 8 the half base CD for the depth of a squared prisma or piece of
Timber, we may find the solid content thereof by the 44 Chapter, and that
according to any length required.

CHAP. XLVII. How that prisma or piece of Timber, whose base or end is a
Rhombus, (or Diamond form) may be measured.
A Rhombus (or Diamond) is a figure of 4 equal sides, but no right angles,
such as is the figure ABCD.

Now seeing every Rhombus, is equal in their superficial content, to that
right angled parallelogram (or long square) whose length is one of the sides,
and breadth equal to the parallel distance of the same sides.

If we take one of the sides for the breadth, and the length of the
perpendicular falling thereon from the opposite angle, for the depth of a
squared solid, we may find the solid content thereof by the 44 Chapter.

As for example, let the Rhombus ABCD be the base or end of some piece of
timber to be measured: now taking one of the sides which is 10 for the breadth
of a squared solid, and the perpendicular which is something better then 8 for
the depth of the same solid, we may find the solid content thereof for any
length required by the 44 Chapter.

diagram of the measurement of a rhombus (ABCD)

CHAP. XLVIII. How that prisma or piece of Timber whose base or end is a
Rhomboides (or Diamond like) may be measured.
A Rhomboides (or Diamond like) is a figure, whose opposite sides, and opposite
angles, are only equal, and it has no right angles. Such as is the figure
EFGH.

Now seeing that the Rhomboides is also equal in his superficial content, to
that right angled parallelogram whose length is one of the sides, and breadth
equal to the parallel distance of the same sides.

If we take one of the sides for the breadth of a squared solid, and the length
of the perpendicular falling thereon from the opposite angle for the depth of
the same solid, we may find the solid content thereof by the 45 Chapter.

diagram of the measurement of a rhomboid (EFGH)

Let this Rhomboides EFGH be the base of a piece of Timber to be measured. Now
if you take 16 the side GH or OF for the breadth of a squared solid, and 10 the
length of the perpendicular EL for the depth of the same solid; you may find
the solid content thereof by the 45 Chapter for any length required.

CHAP. XLIX. How that prisma or piece of Timber, whose base or end is a
trapeziam may be measured.
A Trapeziam, is any irregular fouresided figure of what fashion soever, as
this figure ABCD is a trapeziam, and may be cast into two Triangles, by drawing
the diagonall line AC, and so each Triangle measured as is before showed; which
being done, add the contents of them both together, and you shall have the
content of the whole trapeziam. Or when you have drawn the diagonall line, and
from the two opposite angles let down the perpendiculars thereon, join the two
perpendiculars together, and take the sum thereof for the breadth of a squared
solid, and take one half, the diagonall line, for the depth of the same solid,
with which breadth and depth proceed by the 44 Chapter, according to your
length given; and you shall thereby find the solid content required.

diagram of the measurement of a trapezium (ABCD)

Let the trapeziam ABCD be the base or end of a piece of Timber: now if you
take the two perpendiculars BF, and DE, and join them together they will make
10 for the breadth of a squared solid, and then take one half the diagonall
AC, which will be 8 for the depth of the same solid, you may by the 44 Chapter
find the solid content thereof according to any length given.

CHAP. L. How that prisma or piece of Timber, whose base or end has many
sides, (as 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more, so they be equal) may be measured.
MAny sided figures are those which have more sides then four; and are
generally called polygons; as this figure A, having equal sides and Angles, is
called a polygon.

Every regular polygon, being equal in the superficial content, to that long
square whose length is equal to one half the perimiter, and breadth to a
perpendicular drawn from the Center to the middle of any side thereof.

diagram of the measurement of a polygon (regular pentagon)

If we add all the sides together, and take half the sum for the breadth of
a squared solid and then take the perpendicular for the depth of the same
solid, we may by the 44 Chapter find the solid content thereof.

Let the figure A be the base or end of a piece of Timber to be measured,
consisting of 5 equal sides, and each side containing 12 inches, which being
added together into one sum makes 60, the half whereof is 30 for the
breadth of your piece: then take the length of the perpendicular (falling from
the Center A to the midst of one of the sides,) which is 8 inches; for the
depth of the same piece, with which breadth and depth, you may proceed to find
the solid content by the 44 Chapter, acording to any length given.

A note to find the centers of those equiangle figures.
If the sides be even, the Center is found by drawing lines from one angle to
his opposite angle; but if they be odd, it is found by drawing lines from the
middle of a side to his opposite angle; so shall the cutting or intersection of
those straight lines show the place of the center.

CHAP. LI. Having the circumference and Diameter of a Cylinder given in inches,
and the length in feet, to find the content in feet.
As 12 inches, to the Diameter in inches: So is the length in feet, to a fourth
number.
Then, As 12 inches, to one quarter of the circumference: So is this fourth
number, to the solid content in feet.


As for example, let the figure A be a cylinder, or some round piece of Timber
to be measured, whose circumference is 44 inches, and Diameter 14 inches; and
let the length thereof be 10 foot, now for to find the solid content.

First, place the thread to the intersection of the contrary parallel of 12,
with the right parallel of 14; and it will cut the contrary parallel of 10, at
the right parallel of 11; now where this right parallel of 11, cutteth the
contrary parallel of 12, there place the thread again, so shall it cut the
contrary parallel of 11, at the right parallel of 10 7/10, and so many solid
feet is contained in this cylinder or round piece of Timber.

CHAP. LII. Having the circumference and Diameter of a cylinder or round piece
of Timber, in inches, to find the length of a foot solid in inches.
AS the Diameter in inches, Is to 12 inches: So is 12 inches, To a fourth
number.
Then As one quarter of the Circumference, Is to 12 inches: So is this fourth
number, To the length of a foot solid.


Thus in the cylinder in the last Chapter, having the circumference 44 inches,
and the Diameter 14 inches, we may find how many inches in length will make a
foot solid of that round piece of Timber.

For if we place the thread to the intersection of the contrary parallel of 14
inches, with the right parallel of 12 inches; it will cut the contrary parallel
of 12 inches, at the right parallel of 10 2/7; then again I place the thread at
the intersection of the contrary parallel of one quarter of the circumference
(which is 11 inches,) with the right parallel of 12 inches; and that will cut
the contrary parallel of 30 2/7 (which was the fourth number,) at the right
parallel of 11 17/77, and so many inches in length will make a foot solid, of
that round piece of Timber, whose circumference is 44 inches.

CHAP. LIII. Having the circumference of a cylinder given in inches, and the
length in feet, to find the content in feet.
As 42 55/100, to the circumference in inches: So is the length in feet, to a
fourth number.
Then as 42 55/100, to the circumference in inches, So is this fourth number,
to the content in fect.


Thus in the cylinder of the 51 Chapter, having the circumference 44 inches,
and the length 10 foot, we may find the solid content.

For if we place the thread at the intersection of the contrary parallel of 42
55/100, with the right parallel of 44; it will cut the contrary parallel of 10,
at the right parallel of 10 34/100, then keeping the thread in the some
position, it will cut the contrary parallel of this 10 34/100, at the right
parallel of 10 ^, and so many solid feet is in that round piece of Timber.

CHAP. LIVE. Having the circumference of a cylinder given in inches, to find
the length of a foot solid in inch measure.
As the circumference in inches, is to 42 55/100; So is 12 inches, to a fourth
number.
Then As the circumference in inches, is to 42 55/100: So is this fourth
number, to the length of a foot solid in inches.


Thus in the round piece of Timber of the 51 Chapter, having the circumference
44 inches, we may find the length of a foot solid in inches.

For if we place the thread at the intersection of the contrary parallel of 44
inches; with the right parallel of 42 55/100: it will cut the contrary parallel
of 12, at the right parallel of 11 6/10: now the thread lying in the same
position, you shall see it cut the contrary parallel of this 11 6/10, at the
right parallel of 11 22/100; and so many inches in length will make a foot
solid of that round piece of Timber, whose circumference is 44 inches.

CHAP. LV. Having the Diameter of a cylinder given in inches, and the length in
feet, to find the content in feet.
AS 13 54/100, to the Diameter in inches: So is the length in feet, to a fourth
number.
Then, As 13 54/100, to the Diameter in inches: So is this fourth number, to
the content in feet,


Thus in the cylinder of the 52 Chapter, having the Diameter 14 inches, and the
length 10 foot, we may find the content in feet.

For if we place the thread at the intersection of the contrary parallel of 13
54/100, with the right parallel of 14 inches; it will cut the contrary parallel
of 10 foot, at the right parallel of 10 34/100; then keeping the thread in the
same position, it will cut the contrary parallel of this 10 34/100, at the
right parallel of 10 7/10, and such is the solid content of that cylinder,
whose Diameter is 14 inches.

CHAP. LVI. Having the Diameter of a cylinder given in inches, to find the
length of a foot solid.
AS the Diameter in inches, is to 13 54/100; So is 12 inches, to a fourth
number:
Then, As the Diameter in inches, is to 13 54/100: So is this fourth number, to
the length of a foot solid in inches.


Thus in the cylinder of the 51 Chapter, having the Diameter 14 inches, we may
find how many inches in length will make a foot solid.

For if we place the thread to the intersection of the contrary parallel of 14
inches, with the right parallel of 13 54/100; it will cut the contrary parallel
of 12 inches, at the right parallel of 11 6/10; now the thread lying still in
the same position, you shall see it cut the contrary parallel of this 11 6/10,
at the right parallel of 11 22/100, and such is the length of a foot of that
cylinder, whose Diameter is 14 inches.

CHAP. LVII. Having the circumference and Diameter of the base of a cone given
in inches, with the altitude thereof in feet, to find the solid content in
feet.
AS 12 inches, To the Diameter in inches: So is the third part of his altitude
in feet, To a fourth number.
Then, As 12 inches, To one quarter of his circumference in inches: So is this
fourth number, To the solid content in feet.


As for example, let the figure ABC be a cone, or some round tapering piece of
Timber or stone, which runs tapering from the base thereof BC, to a very
point at A like a piked Steeple.

Let the circumference of the base BC be 132 inches, and the Diameter 42
inches, and let the altitude be 9 foot, which is the line AD, the axis or
perpendicular falling from the highest point at A, to the very center of the
base at D.

Now for to find the content, if you place the thread to the intersection of
the contrary parallel of 12 inches, with the right parallel of 42 inches, it
will cut the contrary parallel of 3 foot, (which is the third part of the
Altitude given,) at the right parallel of 10 ^;

diagram of the measurement of a cone (ABC)

Then again, if you place the thread to the intersection of the contrary
parallel of 12 inches, with the right parallel of 33, (which is one quarter of
the circumference,) it will cut the contrary parallel of 10, at the right
parallel of 28, and so many foot solid is in this cone, whose circumference is
132 inches, and Diameter 42 inches, and altitude 9 foot.

CHAP. LVIII. Having the circumference of the base of a cone given in inches,
and his altitude in feet, to find the solid content in feet.
AS 42 55/100 inches. To the circumference in inches: So is the third part of
his altitude in inches, To a fourth number.
Then As 42 55/100 inches, To the circumference in inches; So is this fourth
uumber, To the content in feet.


Thus in the cone of the last Chapter having the circumference of the base 132
inches, and his altitude 9 foot we may find his solid content in feet.

For if we place the the thread to the intersection of the contrary parallel of
42 55/100, with the right parallel of 132; it will cut the contrary parallel of
3, (which is the third part of his altitude) at the right parallel of 9 3/10;
then keeping the thread in the same position, it will cut the contrary parallel
of this 9 3/10, at the right parallel of 28 and so many solid feet is in that
cone, whose bases circumference is 132 inches, and altitude 9 foot.

CHAP. LIX. Having the Diameter of the base of a cone given in inches, and his
altitude in feet, to find the solid content in feet.
AS 13 54/100 inches, To the Diameter in inches: So is the third part of his
altitude in feet, To a fourth number.
Then, As 13 54/100 inches, To the diameter in inches: So is this fourth
number, To the solid content in feet.


Thus in the cone of the 57 Chapter, having the Diameter of his base 42 inches,
and his altitude 9 foot, we may find his solid content in feet.

For if we place the thread to the intersection of the contrary parallel of 13
54/100, with the right parallel of 42 inches; it will cut the contrary parallel
of 3 foot, at the right parallel of 9 3/10; and lying in this same position it
shall cut the contrary parallel of this 9 3/10, at the right parallel of 28,
the solid content of the cone, as before.

CHAP. LX. Having the side and semidiameter of a cone, to find his altitude or
perpendicular falling from the top thereof, perpendicularly upon his base.
FIrst, place the bead to the side of the cone given upon the side of the
Quadrat, and then open the thread till the bead fall directly upon the right
parallel of the semidiameter of the base, so shall the bead cut the contrary
parallel of the altitude required.

Thus in the cone of the 57 Chapter having the semidiameter of his base 21
inches, and his side 9 foot and something better then 2 inches, that is 110
inches; if you place the bead to 110 inches, counted on the side of the
quadrat, and then open the thread till the bead fall directly upon the right
parallel of 21 inches, it shall cut the contrary parallel of 108 inches, which
is just 9 foot for the altitude of the cone, which was required.

CHAP. LXI. Having the side of a segment of a cone, with the semidiameter of
each base or end thereof, to find the altitude of the whole cone, as it were
before it was cut off, with the altitude of the lesser cone which was cut off.
FIrst, take the lesser semidiameter out of the greater and note the
difference, then say, As this difference, To the side of the segment of the
cone: So is the greater semidiameter; To the altitude of the whole cone. And
the less semidiameter, To the altitude of the lesser cone which was cut off.


Thus in the cone of the 57 Chapter, although it should be cut off by the plane
OF equidistantly to the base BC, yet having the side of the segment BEFC, of
the cone ABC, which is BE or CF 6 foot and one inch, or 73 38/100 inches, with
the semidiameter of the greater base 21 inches, and the lesser 7 inches, we may
find the perpendicular of the whole greater cone as it were before it was cut
off, and also of the lesser which was cut off.

For if you take 7 inches out of 21, there will remain 14 inches; and then if
you place the thread to the intersection of the contrary parallel of 14 inches,
with the right parallel of 73 38/100 inches, it will cut the contrary parallel
of 21 inches, (the semidiameter of the base of the greater cone) at the right
parallel of 108 inches, which is 9 foot, the altitude of the whole greater
cone, as if it had not been cut off. The thread lying still in the same
position, does likewise cut the contrary parallel of 7 inches, (which is the
semidiameter of the base of the lesser cone which was cut off) at the right
parallel of 36 inches, or 3 foot, the altitude of the lesser cone, which was
required.

CHAP. LXII. How the segment cut off from any cone may be measured.
THe segment of a cone is no other then a round tapering piece of Timber cut
off before it comes to a point, and may be measured by that which before is
delivered: when therefore at any time you meet with any such solid piece,
(which will be more ordinarily then with any other) first get the length of his
side, and then his semidiameter at each end, and so by the last Chapter, the
altitude of the whole greater cone, and also of the lesser, which is supposed
to be added to the segment to make it a perfect cone; this being done, by the
59, or 60 Chapters, measure the content of the whole greater cone, and also of
the lesser; and taking the content of the lesser out of the greater, the
remainder without out doubt must be the content of the segment given.

As for example, let the segment BEFC of the cone in the 57 Chapter, be given
to be measured, let the side thereof be 73 38/100 inches, and the semidiameter
of the greater base BD 21 inches, and the semidiameter of the lesser base EK 7
inches, and so by the last Chapter, the altitude of the whole greater cone AD 9
foot, and the altitude of the lesser added cone AK 3 foot, and then by the 59
Chapter, the content of the whole greater cone will be 28 feet, and the lesser
added cone 1 foot and something better, or 1 5/72 foot, the which if you take
out of 28 feet, the content of the whole greater cone, there will remain 27
29/36 feet, for the content of the segment BEFC which was required.

CHAP. LXIII. To find the solid content of any pyramid.
LEt the base of the pyramid be of what manner it will, you need do no more but
take one third part of his altitude, and then suppose it to be a prisma (having
equal bases, like, and parallel) whose length is equal to the third part of the
pyramid, you may find the solid content by one or other of the former Chapters
concerning prisma's.

As for example, let the following quadrangular pyramid be given to be
measured, the side of whose base is 36 inches, and the side of the pyramid 76
36/100 inches, with the semidiameter of the circle enclosing the base, which is
AB 25 45/100 inches, by which, and the side given, with the help of the 60
Chapter, we may find the altitude AD to be 72 inches or 6 foot; now having the
side of the base in inches, and the altitude in feet, we may find the content
in fect.

For As 12 inches, to the side of the base in inches: So is the third part of
the altitude in feet, To a fourth number. And this fourth number, To the solid
content in feet.


Wherefore, if you apply the thread to the intersection of the contrary
parallel of 12, with the right parallel of 2 foot, the third part of the
altitude; it will cut the contrary parallel of 36 inches the side of the base,
at the right parallel of 6; the thread lying still in the same position, will
cut the contrary parallel of this 6, at the right parallel of 18, and such is
the solid content of this pyramid in feet which was required.

diagram of the measurement of a pyramid

Now if you would measure any segment of a pyramid being cut off, observe the
former rules given for the measuring of the segment of a cone, and you shall
soon have your desire.

For having the side of the segment of the pyramid, with the semidiameters of
the circumscribing circles at each base, you may by the 61 Chapter, find the
altitude of the whole greater pyramid, as if it had not been cut off, and also
of the lesser pyramid which is supposed to be added to the segment, to make it
a perfect pyramid; this being done, you may by the rules delivered, first get
the content of the whole greater pyramid, and then of the lesser added pyramid,
and taking the lesser out of the greater, the remainder will be the content of
the given segment, as was required.

The end of the first Book.
The Second Book.
Showing the most plentiful, easy, and speedy use of the Universal Quadrat,
in the Resolution of the whole Doctrine Trigonometrical, as well plain as
sphericall, and that two several ways upon the Instrument, with surpassing
facility, and with the least intricacie that may be.
CHAP. I. To find the chord of any arch, the radius being given, not exceeding
the side of the quadrat.
THe radius of a circle, is the semidiameter of the same circle, or the total
sine or sine of 90 degrees; so AE is the semidiameter or radius upon which the
divided arch EG was dramn; and AB is the radius upon which the arch BFC was
drawn.

And a Chord is a right line subtending an arch; so BC is the chord of the arch
BFC, for the finding of which chord for any arch required, place the radius
given upon the side of the quadrat from the center, and note the point where
the same ends, and there place the bead; then opening the thread to the arch
given, counted in the quadrant, the distance between the point noted in the
side of the quadrat, and the head shall be the chord required.

diagram of the measurement of an arch

As for example, let AB be the radius of a circle placed upon the side of the
quadrat, and let it be required to find a chord of 40 degrees. First I place
the bead at the point B where the given radius ended, and opening the thread to
40 degrees, in the quadrant, I take the distance betwixt the point B, and the
bead; which is the chord of 40 degrees, viz. the chord of the arch BFC, drawn
upon the given radius AB, as was required, and thus may you find the chord of
any arch as well as upon the sector.

CHAP. II. To find the right sine of any arch given, the radius being put 1000.
HAving showed the use of these parallel lines as they stand in their own
proper signification; it rests now to show the use of them, as they signify
right fines and tangents: and first to find the right fine of any arch, seek
the degree given upon the quadrant counted from any side of the quadrant; but
here let it be from the beginning of the degrees at E, so shall the right
parallel running through the degree given in the quadrant; give the number of
the fine required; but if you would have the fine in a right line, take the
length of the contrary parallel from the side of the quadrat AE, to the degree
given in the quadrat; and that shall be your desired sine; whereof the whole
side is radius.

As for example, let it be required to find the right sine of 53 degrees 8
minutes I look 53 degrees 8 minutes in the quadrant, counted from the beginning
of the degree at E, unto O, through which point O runeth the right parallel of
800, this 800 is the right sine of 53 degrees 8 minutes, 100 being radius.

But if you would have this sine in a right line, take the length of the
contrary paaallel from the point O unto N, for the right sine of 53 degrees 8
minutes which was required.

CHAP. III. To find the arch of any sine given, the radius being put 1000.
IF your sine be given in numbers, seek the right parallel of the number
given, for where that parallel cutteth the quadrant, there is the arch
required, counted from the beginning of the degrees at E as before.

But if your sine be given in a right line, then from the side of your quadrat
AE, extend your given sine upon any of the contrary parallels; and that right
parallel that shall cut through the extreme point thereof, shall cut the
quadrant in the required arch.

As for example, let 800 be a sine given, unto which it is required to find
the arch belonging thereto; I seek 800 in the right parallels, and finding it,
I follow it to the quadrant, and there I see it cut the arch of 53 degrees 8
minutes, counted from E, which 53 degrees 8 minutes is the arch belonging to
the sine 800, the radius being 1000.

But if the sine be given in a right line, take it betwixt your compasses, and
setting one foot in the side of the quadrat AE, extend the other upon any of
the contrary parallels, as here I set one foot in the point N, and extend the
other unto O, through which point the right parallel of 800 runs, and
cutteth the quadrant in 53 degrees 8 minutes counted from E as before.

CHAP. IV. Any radius not exceeding the side of the quadrat being given, to
find the right sine of any arch or angle thereunto belonging.
FIrst, take the given radius and place it upon the contrary parallel of 100,
which is the total sine; and where it shall end there place the thread, which
being so placed; see where it cutteth the contrary parallel that passes
through the given arch, counted in the quadrant from G: for the segment so cut,
which lies between the thread and the side AE, is the fine required.

diagram of the measurement of an arch (lines A and B)

Let the line A be the radius given, and let it be required to find the sine
of 36 degrees 53 minutes.

First, I take the line A, and place it upon the contrary parallel of 100, as
from E to D, upon which point D, I place the thread; this done I count the
given arch viz. 36 degrees 33 minutes from the end of the quadrant at G unto O,
and see what contrary parallel there I find, which is 60 intersecting the
thread at M; so shall the distance NM be the line B the sine of 36 degrees 53
minutes, as was required.

CHAP. V. The right sine of any arch being given, to find the radius.
FIrst, take the given sine, and place it from the side AE of your quadrat,
along upon that contrary parallel which cutteth the degrees of the sine given,
counted in the quadrant from G, and where the sine ends there place the
thread; so shall it show upon the contrary parallel of 100, the radius required.

Let the line B in the foregoing Chapter, be a given sine of 36 degrees 53
minutes. First, place it from N to M, upon that parallel which runs through
the degrees of 36 and 53 minutes as at O, then upon the point M, I place the
thread; so does it cut the contrary parallel of 100, in the point D; making DE
the radius, which is the line A in the foregoing Chapter, as was required.

CHAP. VI. The radius being given, with a straight line resembling a sine, to
find the quantity of that unknown sine.
FIrst, place the given radius upon the contrary parallel of 100, and thereto
apply the thread; then take the right sine given, and setting one foot of your
compasses in the side of the quadrat, carry it parallel to the former, till the
other foot cut the thread, and there stay; for the parallel where the compasses
so rests, shall cut the quadrant in the degrees answering to that unknown
sine given.

As if the line A in the fourth Chapter, were the radius given, and B the
straight line resembling a sine: First, I place the line A from E to D, upon
the contrary parallel of 100, and apply the thread thereto; the thread lying in
this position, I take the line B, and fixing one foot in the side of the
quadrat AE, I carry it parallel to the former, until the other foot touch the
thread, so will one foot rest in the point N, and the other in M, upon the
parallel of 60, which parallel cutteth the quadrat in the point O at 36 degrees
53 minutes, counted from G, this 36 degrees 53 minutes, is the arch, of which
the given line B is the sine, the line A being radius.

CHAP. VII. The use of these parallels, as they signifienaturall sines.
I Told you in the fourth Chapter, of the foregoing Book, that these lines did
sometimes signify themselves alone, sometimes sines, and sometimes tangents, and
now for (distinction sake) when I call them parallels, I would have you to
understand them as they are in their own proper signification; and when I call
them Sines, I would have them understood as the Sines of those arches through
which they run; and when I call them Tangents, I would have them understood as
the Tangent of those degrees, against which they butt in the sides of the
quadrant.

And further for distincton, whereas in their own signification I call them
right and contrary parallels, so now I call them right and contrary sines, and
right and contrary tangents.

These lines as they signify sines, has like use in finding a fourth
proportional sine, as the ordinary Canon of Natural sines: and the manner of
finding it, is always such as in this example. As the sine of 90 degrees unto
the sine of 30 degree: So is the sine of 23 degrees 30 minutes unto a fourth
sine.


Wherefore place the thread at the intersection of the contrary Sine of 90
degrees, with the right Sine of 30 degrees, and it will cut the contrary Sine
of 23 degres 30 minutes, at the right Sine of 11 degrees 30 minutes, and such
is the fourth proportional Sine required.

Or you may place the thread at the intersection of the contrary Sine of 90
degrees with the right Sine of 23 degrees 30 minutes, and it shall cut the
contrary Sine of 30 degrees, at the right sine of 11 degrees 30 minutes, as
before.

And thus may all the rest of the sinical propositions be wrought both ways.

CHAP. VIII. The use of these parallels, as they signify both Sines and
Tangents.
HEre the work is in a manner the same as before, as will appear by this
example. As the Sine of 90 degrees, to the Sine of 51 degr. 30 min. So is the
Tangent of 30 degrees, to a fourth Tangent.


Thus placeing the thread upon the intersection of the contrary Sine of 90
degrees, with the right Sine of 51 degrees 30 minutes, it will cut the contrary
Tangent of 30 degrees, at the right Tangent of 24 degrees 20 minutes.

Or if you place the thread at the intersection of the contrary Sine of 90
degrees, with the right Tangent of 30 degrees, it will cut the contrary Sine of
51 degrees 30 minutes, at the right Tangent of 24 degrees 20 minutes, which is
the fourth proportional Tangent required.

And this manner of work will hold, until the Tangents be greater then 45
degrees the side of the quadrat. But when the given tangent or tangents exceed
45 degrees the side of the quadrat, if the two first given numbers be Sines and
the third a Tangent; set the second Sine in the place of the first, and the
first Sine in the place of the second; and in steed of the given Tangent, take
his complement unto a quadrant; so shall the fourth proportional, be the
complement of the Tangent required. As for example, in this proportion. As the
Sine of 90 degrees, To the Sine of 20 degrees; So the Tangent of 70 degrees, To
a fourth Tangent.


And because the Tangent of 70 degrees is greater then 45 degrees, the side of
the quadrat, therefore I turn the proportion thus. As the Sine of 20 degrees,
To the Sine of 90 degrees; So the Co-tangent of 70 degrees, To the Co-tangent
of the sum required.


Thus placing the thread upon the intersection of the contrary sine of 20
degrees, with the right Tangent of 20 degrees, (the complement of 70 degrees,)
it should cut the contrary Sine of 90 degrees, at the right Tangent of the
complement of the arch required, but the thread intersecteth not the said
contrary Sine of 90 degrees upon the quadrat, but besides it; which never
happens but when the one Tangent is greater then 45 degrees, and the other
less. Wherefore you are to note, that at any such time, though the thread
cutteth not the contrary Sine of 90 degrees upon the quadrat, yet is the thread
(by the former position) placed at the true angle of the Tangent required;
which is 46 degrees 47 minutes, the complement whereof 43 degrees 13 minutes,
is the arch required. And if the first given numbers be Tangents, and the third
a Sine; take the complements of the two Tangents and exchange their places, as
in the examples following. But if one be more and the others less, as in this
proportion. As the Tangent of 70 degrees, To the Tangent of 43 degrees 13
minutes; So the Sine of 90 degrees: To a fourth Sine.


Herein regard the Tangent of 70 degrees is more then 45 degrees, and the
Tangent of 43 degrees less then the same, if you open the thread to the
greater Tangents angle, viz. to the angle of 70 degrees, it shall cut the right
Tangent of the lesser, viz. the right Tangent of 43 degrees 13 minutes at the
contrary Sine of 20 degrees, and such is the fourth proportional Sine required.

I have been the larger in this, to prevent mistakes in the rest.

CHAP. IX. The use of these parallels, as they are in their own signification,
joined with their signification of Sines and Tangents.
THis manner of work is the same with the former, only you must know when the
lines signify themselves alone, and when Sines and Tangents; the which you may
know by the proportions given, as here in this example. As the Sine of 53
degrees 8 minutes, unto 80: So is the Sine of 36 degrees. 52 min. unto a fourth
number.


Here if you place the thread at the intersection of the contrary Sine of 53
degrees 8 minutes with the right parallel of 80; it shall cut the contrary Sine
of 36 degrees 52 minutes at the right parallel of 60, and such is the fourth
proportional number required.

Of the resolution of right lined Triangles
CHAP. X. Having three angles and one side to find the other two sides.
IN all Triangles there being six parts viz. three Angles and three Sides, any
three whereof being known in a sphericall Triangle, the other three may be
found by the universal quadrat; but in a right lined Triangle, one of the three
given terms must be a Side in the finding of the other parts.

Thus having three angles and one Side, you may find the other two Sides by
this proportion. As the Sine of the angle opposite to the given Side, To the
number belonging to the same Side: So is the Sine of the angle opposite to the
Side required, To the number belonging to the Side required.


Let the following Triangle ABC be given, whereof the three angles and the Side
AB is known; viz. the angle ACB 53 degrees 8 minutes, the angle CAB 36 degrees
52 minutes, and the angle ABC 90 degrees, the given side AB being 80, it is
required to find the other two sides viz. AC and BC.

Knowing the angle ACB opposite to the given side AB to be 53 degrees 8
minutes, and the angle opposite to the required side BC to be 36 degrees 52
minutes, I place the thread upon the intersection of the contrary Sine of 53
degrees 8 minutes with the right parallel of 80 his opposite side; the thread
lying in this position I see it cut the contrary Sine of 36 degrees 52 minutes,
at the right parallel of 60 his opposite side; therefore I conclude the side BC
to be 60 such parts as AB is 80.

The thread lying still in the former position see where it cutteth the
contrary Sine of the third angle, for there is the right parallel of the third
side: so here the thread cutteth the contrary Sine of 90 degrees, (which is the
third angle) at the right parallel of 100, which is the side AC, as was
required.

So here you see the thread once placed, gives both the sides required, and
that right speedily in all Triangles; as well in oblique angled as right angled
triangles.

CHAP. XI. Having two sides given, and one angle opposite to either of them; to
find the other two angles, and the third side.
AS the side opposite to the angle given, Is to the Sine of the angle given: So
is the other side given, To the sine of that angle to which it is opposite.
diagram of the measurement of a triangle (ABC)

Thus in the Triangle ADC, having the two sides AD 35, and CD 75, with the
angle ACD 16 degrees 16 minutes, being opposite to the side AD; I may find the
angle CAD which is opposite to the other side CD, for if I place the thread
upon the intersection of the contrary parallel of 35, with the right Sine of 16
degrees 16 minutes, it shall cut the contrary parallel of 75, at the right sine
of 36 degrees 52 minutes, his opposite angle, the angle CAD.

Then keeping the thread in the former position, add these two known angles
together, and they will give you the outward angle ADC 53 degrees 8 minutes,
now where the right Sine of 53 degrees 8 minutes, cutteth the thread, there is
the contrary parallel of 100, which is the third side AC, as was required.

CHAP. XII. Having two sides and the angle between them, to find the two other
angles and the third side.
IF the angle contained between the two sides be a right angle, the other two
angles will be found readily by this proportion As the greater side given, Is
to the lesser side; So is the Tangent of 45 degrees, To the Tangent of the
lesser angle.


So in the rectangle Triangle ABC, knowing the side AB to be 80, and the side
BC to be 60. If I place the thread upon the intersection of the contrary
parallel of 80, with the right parallel of 60; it shall cut the contrary
Tangent of 45 degrees at the right Tangent of 36 degrees 52 minutes, and such
is the lesser angle CAB; the complement whereof unto a quadrant is the greater
angle ACB 53 degrees 8 minutes, the angles being known, the third side AC may
be found by the 10 Chapter.

But if it be an oblique angle that is between the two sides given; the
Triangle may be reduced into two rectangles and then resolved as before.

As in the Triangle ADC, where the side AC is 100, and the side AD 35, and the
angle CAD 36 degrees 52 minutes, if you let down the perpendicular DE, upon the
side AC, you shall have two rectangle Triangles, AED, DEC; and in the rectangle
AED, the angle at A being 36 degrees 52 minutes, the other angle ADE will be 53
degrees 8 minutes, by complement: and with these angles and the side AD, you
may find both AE and DE, by the tenth Chapter.

Then taking AE out of AC, there remains EC for the side of the rectangle DEC;
and therefore with this side EC and the other DE, you may find both the angle
at C, and the third side CD, by the former part of this Chapter.

Or you may find the angles required, without letting down any perpendicular.

For As the sum of the sides, Is to the difference of the sides: So the Tangent
of the half sum of the opposite angles, To the Tangent of half the difference
between those angles,


As in the former Triangle ADC, the sum of the sides AC and AD, is 135, and the
difference between them 65; the angle contained 36 degrees 52 minutes; and
therefore the sum of the two opposite angles 143 degrees 8 minutes, and the
half sum 71 degrees 34 minutes, and because the half sum 71 degrees 34
minutes, is greater then the side of the quadrat 45 degrees, therefore I turn
the proportion after this manner. As the difference of the sides 65, Is to the
sum of the sides 135: So is the co-tangent of the half sum of the opposite
angles 71 degrees 34 minutes. To the co-tangent of half the difference between
those angles.


Therefore if you place the thread upon the intersection of the contrary
parallel of 65, with the right parallel of 135, you shall see it cut the
contrary Tangent of 18 degrees 26 minutes, (which is the complement of 71
degrees 34 minutes,) at the right Tangent of 34 degrees 42 minutes, the
complement whereof is 55 degrees 18 minutes, and such is the half difference
between the opposite angles at B and D, this half difference being added to
the half sum, gives 126 degrees 52 minutes, for the greater angle ADC, and
being subtracted, leaves 16 degrees 16 minutes for the lesser angle ACD, the
three angles being thus found, you may find the third side CD by the tenth
Chapter.

CHAP. XIII. Having the three sides of a right lined Triangle, to find the
three angles.
LEt one of the three sides given be the base, but rather the greater side,
that the perpendicular may fall within the Triangle; then gather the sum and
difference of the two other sides, which being done the proportion will be. As
the base of the Triangle, Is to the sum of the sides; So the difference of the
sides To the alternate base.


This alternate base being taken out of the true base, if we let down the
perpendicular from the opposite angle, it shall fall upon the middle of the
remainder.

As in the former Triangle ADC, where the base AC is 100, the sum of the sides
AD and CD is 110, and the difference of them 40.

Therefore if you place the thread upon the intersection of the contrary
parallel of 100, with the right parallel of 110, it will cut the contrary
parallel of 40, at the right parallel of 44, for the alternate base; this
alternate base take out of 100 the true base, and the remainder will be 56, the
half whereof is 28, and shows the distance from A unto E, where the
perpendicular shall fall, from the angle D, upon the base AC, dividing the
former Triangle ACD into two right angled Triangles, viz. AED and DEC, in which
the angles may be found by the 11th. Chapter.

Thus you may see how by this universal quadrat, we have resolved the four
propositions of Mr. Gunters upon his Crosse-staffe; whereby you may perceive
the agreement betwixt this quadrat and his staff.

And now I will show how they may be otherwise resolved upon this uniuersal
quadrat, agreeing nearer with the Sector; but more spendily performed, then by
either Sector or Cross-staffe.

CHAP. XIIII. In a rectangle Triangle having the angles and one of the sides
given, to find the other side and the base.
OPen the thread to the angle opposite to the side given, so shall it intersect
the right parallel of the side given, at the contrary parallel of the side
required; and if to the intersection you place the bead, and apply the thread
to the side of the quadrat, it shall there show you the length of the base.

As in the right angled Triangle ABC in the 11 Chapter, the Side BC being
given, opposite to the angle BAC 36 degrees 52 minutes, it is required to find
the other Side AB, and the base AC.

First, open the thread to the angle of 36 degrees 52 minutes, so shall it cut
the right parallel of 60, at the contrary parallel of 80, and such is the side
AB, which was required.

The thread lying in the same position, if you place the bead to this
intersection, and then apply the thread to the side of the quadrat, it shall
there give you 100, for the base AC as was required.

CHAP. XV. Having both sides of a rectangle Triangle, to find the two angles
and the base.
AT the intersection of the contrary parallel of the greater side, with the
right parallel of the lesser side, there place the thread; which being so
placed gives the lesser angle required. And if to the intersection you place
the bead and then apply the thread to the side of the quadrat, it shall there
show the base required.

As in the rectangled Triangle ABC in the 11 Chapter, where the two given sides
is AB 80, and BC 60: Wherefore I place the thread at the intersection of the
contrary parallel of 80, with the right parallel of 60, so does the thread give
me the lesser angle at A, which is 36 degrees 52 minutes, which being known,
the angle ACB will be found by complement, to be 53 degrees 8 minutes, thus
have I both the angles required.

The thread lying in the former position, I place the bead to the intersection
of the two sides; and then applying the thread to the side of the quadrat, it
gives me 100 for the base AC, which was required.

CHAP. XVI To find a side and both the angles, by having the base and the
other side given.
FIrst, lay the thread upon the side of the quadrat, and apply the bead to the
length of the base; then open the thread until the bead fall directly upon the
contrary parallel of the side given, and it shall likewise lie upon the right
parallel of the side required, and the thread shall also show the angle
opposite to the required side.

As in the former rectangle Triangle ABC in the 11th. Chapter, having the base
AC 100, and the side AB 80; if you apply the thread to the side of the quadrat,
and place the bead to 100, and then open the thread until the bead fall
directly upon the contrary parallel of 80, so shall the same bead so posited,
cut the right parallel of 60 the side required. And further, the thread lying
in this constitution, gives the angle opposite to the required side to be 36
degrees 52 minutes, which being known, the other is soon found out by
complement unto 90 degrees.

CHAP. XVII. To find the sides by having the base, and the angles given.
FIrst, place the bead to the base given on the side of the quadrat, then open
the thread to any of the two angles, and the bead shall fall upon the right
parallel of that side which is opposite to the angle, unto which the thread was
opened; and also upon the contrary parallel of the other side.

As for example, in the right angled Triangle ABC in the 11th. Chapter, the
angles at A and C are given, viz. the angle ACB 53 degrees 8 minutes, and the
angle BAC 36 degrees 52 minutes, with the base AC 100, and it is required to
find the two sides AB, and BC.

First, therefore I place the bead unto 100 upon the side of the quadrat, and
opening the thread to the angle of 36 degrees 52 minutes, I find the bead to
fall upon the right parallel of 60, which is the side CB subtending the said
angle; through which intersection does pass the contrary parallel of 80, which
is the other side AB subtending the other angle ACB, which was required.

CHAP. XVIII. In any right lined Triangle whatsoever, to find a side by
knowing the other two sides, and the angle contained by them.
FIrst, place the bead to the shorter side given, and open the thread to the
given angle, then setting one foot of your Compasses in the other side given
upon the side of the quadrat, with the other foot extended to the bead, you
shall have the third side betwixt your compasses.

Thus in the triangle ADC in the 11th. Chapter, having the sides AC 100, and BC
75, and the angle between them ACD 16 degrees 16 minutes if you place the bead
to 75, and open the thread to the angle of 16 degrees 16 minutes, then setting
one foot of your compasses in 100 and extending the other unto the bead, you
shall have 35 betwixt your compasses for the third side AD, which was required.

CHAP. XIX. To find an angle by knowing the three sides.
FIrst, place the bead to the shortest of the sides containing the angle
required; then take the side subtending the same angle betwixt your compasses,
and setting one foot thereof in the third side counted in the side of the
quadrat, with the other foot open or shut the thread, until the bead and the
movable foot of the compasses meet both in one point, so shall the thread show
the angle required.

Thus having the three sides of the Triangle ADC in the 11th. Chapter. First, I
place the bead to 75 the side CD, then I take 35 betwixt my compasses for the
side AD, (which is opposite to the required angle ACD) and setting one foot in
100 (upon the side of the quadrat) for the side AC, I turn the other foot
toward the thread, moving it to and fro until the compass point fall just upon
the bead, so shall the thread cut 16 degrees 16 minutes for the angle ACD, as
was required.

And this may suffice for right lined Triangles, whereby you may perceive the
agreement of this Universal quadrat, both with Sector and Cros-staff. I will
set down only two or three Chapters more, for the ready reducing of
hypothenusal to horizontal lines in the art of Surveying. And for the speedy
searching out of all perpendicular altitudes.

CHAP. XX. Of the ready reducing of hypothenusal to horizontal lines.
FIrst, measure the hypothenusal line with your chain, then place your bead to
the length thereof counted on the side of your quadrat; this being done,
observe by your instrument the angle either ascending or descending, the thread
and plummet having free liberty to play; So shall the bead fall upon the
contrary parallel of the horizontal line required.

Suppose ABCD be a hill or mountain to be protracted, and laid down in your
plot amongst your other grounds.

diagram of the measurement of a triangle (ABC)

It is apparent by the figure, that the hypothenusal lines AB, and C cannot be
laid down exactly in a right line, between the other grounds which bounder on
this hill at the point A and C: wherefore we are to find the true level and
horizontal distance between A and C, which is a right line extending
overthwart the ground whereon the hill stands, which to do first measure the
hypothenusal line BC, which in this example will be found to be 60 pole, unto
which 60 place the bead; then planting your instrument at C, and observing the
ascent from C to B, (by lifting up your Instrument toward B) you shall find
the thread to fall upon 36 degrees 52 minutes, for the angle of the ascent BCD;
and the bead to fall upon the contrary parallel of 48, which is the horizontal
distance CD, which was required.

So likewise, the thread hanging at the former angle the bead as before fixed
shall fall upon the right parallel of 36, which is the length of the
perpendicular BD, being let down from the top of the hill at B through the,
same, unto the horizontal line AC whereon the hill stands. And what is said
here of the ascent CB, the same may be understood of the descent BA.

CHAP. XXI. To find the height of an object accessible at one obsenvation. or
the distance betwixt the top of the object and that point thereof which is
level with your eye.
FIrst, lift up the quadrat looking through both the sights to the top of the
object, going nearer or farther from it, till the thread fall directly on the
opposite angle of the quadrat, which is at the intersection of the right and
contrary parallels of 100, or at 45 degrees, in the quadrant; then letting down
the quadrat still looking through the sights, until the thread fall directly
upon the side of the quadrat; then what point soever you see in the object
through the sights, is level with your eye; then measure the distance betwixt
your eye and the level point in the object, for that is equal to the height
required, above the point level with your eye, this needs no example.

But more readily thus, take a station at any convenient distance, which
distance measure and count the number thereof amongst the contrary parallels;
then lifting up your quadrant looking through the sights to the top of the
object, the thread shall cut the contrary parallel of the measured distance, at
the right parallel of the height required.

Let BC be the height of some Steeple or Tower whose height is required; first,
I measure out any convenient distance; as here I measure from the base of the
object at B, 80 paces unto A, and at AI take my station; and lifting up my
quadrat until I can see the very top of the object at C, through both the
sights, I find the thread to cut the contrary parallel of 80 at the right
parallel of 60, which is the number of places contained in the height BC, as
was required. And this of all others I hold the speediest way for attaining of
all altitudes accessible: and if to this intersection you place the bead, it
shall give you the length of the hypothenusal or scaling ladder AC.

And you may also speedily search out any perpendicular heights by the rules of
proportion after this manner.

diagram of the measurement of a triangle (ABC)

Having made choice of a convenient station as at A, observe the angle at A
made between the hypothenusal line AC, and the level line with your eye AB,
the complement whereof is the angle at the top of the object at C, made between
the hypothenusal line AC, and the line CB, the height required. These being
known, with the distance AB: Say, As the sine of the angle ACB, To the measured
distance AB: So the sine of the angle BAC, To the required height BC.


Thus having found the distance AB to be 80 yards or paces, and the angle at A
to be 36 degrees 52 minutes, the complement whereof is 53 degrees 8 minutes,
for the angle at C; I place the thread at the intersection of the contrary Sine
of 53 degrees 8 minutes with the right parallel of 80; so does the thread cut
the contrary Sine of 36 degrees 52 minutes, at the right parallel of 60,
wherefore I conclude the height BC, to be 60 such parts as AB is 80, which is
the thing required.

CHAP. XXII. To find the height of an object inaccessible, at two observations.
FIrst, as far off your object as conveniently you may, make choice of your
first station; and observe the angle of your eye, made between the visual line
to the top of the object, and the level line with your eye, this being done,
measure forward in a right line toward the object, approaching as near
thereunto as you may, and there make choice of your second station where
observe the angle at your eye as before: now take the complement of this second
angle, out of the complement of the first angle, and note the difference, then,
say, As the sine of the difference of the complements, To the measured
distance; So the Sine of the first angle observed, To the second hypothenusa.
Then again, As the Sine of 90 degrees, To the second hypothenusa: So is the
Sine of the second observed angle, To the height required


As for example, let BC in the former Chapter, be the height of some Tower or
Steeple to be measured, unto which I may not approach, by reason of some River
or other obstacle betwixt the object and me; and yet it is required to find
the altitude BC, and also the breadth of the river BD, with the length of the
scaling ladder CD.

First, therefore I make choice of a station with the best convenience I can,
as at A, where I make observation, and find the angle at my eye to be 36
degrees 52 minutes, the complement whereof is 53 degrees 8 minutes, then
measuring in a right line toward the object, I approach as near as I may,
which is at the point D, finding AD to be 35 paces; and now at D, I make a
second observation, and find the angle at my eye to be 53 degrees 8 minutes,
the complement whereof is 36 degrees 52 minutes, this 36 degrees 52 minutes I
take out of the former complement 53 degrees 8 minutes, and the difference is
16 degrees 16 minutes, the angle ACD, wherefore I place the thread at the
intersection of the contrary Sine of 16 degrees 16 minutes, with the right
parallel of 35, and I find the thread to cut the contrary Sine of 36 degrees
52 minutes (which is the angle at A) at the right Parallel of 75, and such is
the scalling ladder, or hypothenusal line CD.

Then again, I place the thread at the intersection of the contrary Sine of 90
degrees, with the right parallel of 75, and it cutteth the contrary Sine of 53
degrees 8 minutes, (which is the angle at D) at the right parallel of 60, and
such is the line BC, the height required. And the thread in the same position,
cutteth the contrary Sine of the complement of the second angle observed, viz.
36 degrees 52 minutes, at the right parallel of 45, and such is the breadth of
the River or other obstacle BD.

Or having found the length of the second hypothenusal line to be 75, if you
place the bead thereto, and then open the thread to the second observed angle,
viz. 53 degrees 8 minutes, the bead shall fall upon the right parallel of 60,
which is the height BC; and also upon the contrary parallel of 45, which is the
breadth BD, as before, and as was required.

Or more speedily thus, at two observations and one opperation.

First, make choice of your stations as before, then make choice of some one of
your right parallels, that the number thereof may signify the height required;
then at your first station make observation as before, and note the parts cut
by the thread upon the said right parallel; this being done, measure your
stationary distance, as before; and at the second station, make observation, as
you did at the first station; noting likewise the parts cut by the thread upon
the said right parallel; now taking these latter parts out of the former, or
the lesser out of the greater, the difference shall signify the stationary
distance: wherefore, As the distance upon the parallel, To the measured
distance: So the number of the said parallel, To the height required.


Thus in the figure of the foregoing Chapter, I take my first station at A, and
making choice of some one of the right parallels, (as here of the right
parallel of 45) to signify the height required, I make observation toward C,
and I find the thread to cut the said parallel at 60: then measuring the
stationary distance AD, I find it to be 35, and at D, I make a second
observation, and I find the thread to cut the foresaid parallel at about 33
which being taken out of 60, leaves 26 for to signify the stationary
distance; wherefore I place the thread at the intersection of the contrary
parallel of 26, with the right parallel of 35, and it will cut the contrary
parallel of 45, at the right parallel of 60, which is the height BC, as was
required.

Many propositions to this purpose might be framed, but these may suffice for a
taste of the use of this universal quadrat.

And if an index with sights were fitted to turn upon the center it would
serve then by the same reason, for the findeing of all other distances.

Of the resolution of spherical Triangles; and first of those which be right
angled.
CHAP. XXIII. To find a side by knowing the base, and the angle opposite to
the required side.
A Spherical Triangle, is a figure included by three arches of great circles;
the angles whereof are measured by the arch of a great circle subtending the
angle, and intercepted between the containing sides continued to quadrants.

Now in every Triangle there being six parts, viz. three angles and three
sides, any three of them being given in a spherical Triangle, the other three
may be found by the Uniuersal quadrat, and that two several ways, and as it
were by two several Instruments; the former part agreeing nearest with the
sector, the latter part (performed by the Planisphere on the back of the
quadrat) agreeing nearest to the Mathematical Jewel of Master Blagraves; but
the working hereby will appear more clear then through the thick rete of the
Jewel.

First, to find a side by knowing the base, and the angle opposite to the
required side. As the radius, is to the sine of the base: So is the sine of the
opposite angle, To the sine of the side required.


diagram of the measurement of a spherical triangle (ABC)

Let the Triangle ABC be given, wherein let A stand for the point of East or
West; AB an arch of the Horizon representing the azimuth of the Sun from the
East or West points; BC an arch of an azimuth or vertical circle, making right
angles with the Horizon AB, in the point B, representing the Suns altitude; and
AC an arch of the Equator representing the hour from Sun rising or setting
when he has no declination. and further, let the angle at A be the complement
of the latitude, and the angle at C the vertical angle, made between the
equator and the vertical circle passing by the Sun at C, perpendicularly to the
horizon AB, wherefore knowing the base AC to be 65 degrees 23 minutes, and the
angle at A to be 37 degrees 30 minutes, I may find the side BC, for if I place
the thread to the intersection of the contrary Sine of 90 degrees with the
right Sine of 65 degrees 22 minutes it will cut the contrary Sine of 37 degrees
30 minutes, at the right Sine of 33 degrees 36 minutes, and such is the side
BC, which was required.

CHAP. XXIV. To find a side by knowing the base, and the other side.
AS the Sine of the complement of the side given, To the sine of the complement
of the base: So is the radius, To the Sine of the complement of the side
required.
Thus in the rectangle ABC, having AC 65 degrees 23 minutes, and AB, 60
degrees, let it be required to find the side BC, place the thread at the
intersection of the contrary Sine of 30 degrees, (the complement of AB) with
the right Sine of 24 degrees 37 minutes, (the complement of AC) and it shall
cut the contrary Sine of 90 degrees, at the right sine of 56 degrees 24
minutes, the complement whereof is 33 degrees 36 minutes, the side BC, which
was required.

CHAP. XXV. To find a side, by knowing the two oblique angles.
AS the Sine of either angle, To the cosine of the other angle: So is the sine
of 90 degrees, To the cosine of the side opposite to the second angle.
So in the rectangle ABC, having ACB for the first angle 72 degrees 16 minutes,
and BAC for the second 37 degrees 30 minutes, it is required to find the side
BC, wherefore I place the the thread at the intersection of the contrary Sine
of 72 degrees 16 minutes, with the right Sine of 52 degrees 30 minutes, (the
complement of the angle at A) and I find it cut the contrary Sine of 90
degrees, at the right Sine of 56 degrees 24 minutes, whose complement is 33
degrees 36 minutes, the side BC, as was required.

CHAP. XXVI To find the base, by knowing both the sides.
AS the radius, to the cosine of the one side: So the cosine of the other side,
To the cosine of the base.
Thus in the rectangle ABC, knowing the latitude of the place, with the
altitude of the Sun having no declination, we may find the hour of the day;
as having BC the altitude of the Sun 33 degrees 36 minutes and the angle BAC
the complement of the latitude 37 degrees 30 minutes, the base AC which is the
hour of the day counted from Sun rising or setting, will be found by the
quadrat. For if you apply the thread to the intersection of the contrary Sine
of 37 degrees 30 minutes with the right Sine of 33 degrees 36 minutes, it will
cut the contrary Sine of 90 degrees, at the right Sine of 65 degrees 23 minutes
and such is the base AC, which being reduced into time (by allowing 15 degrees
to an hour, and for every 4 minutes a degree) gives 4 hours 22 minutes for
the time after Sun rise, or before Sun set: so that if it be in the forenoon it
is 10 a clock and 22 minutes, the Sun then rising at 6; and if it be in the
afternoon it is 38 minutes past one.

CHAP. XXVIII. To find an angle, by knowing the other oblique angle, and the
side opposite to the inquired angle.
A the radius, To the sine of the angle given: So the cosine of the side, To
the cosine of the angle required.
Thus in the Rectangle ABC, having the angle BAC 37 degrees 30 minutes, with
the side AB 60 degrees, to find the angle ACB: I place the thread at the
intersection of the contrary Sine of 90 degrees with the right Sine of 37
degrees 30 minutes, so will it cut the contrary sine of 30 degrees, (the
complement of the side AB) at the right Sine of 17 degrees 44 minutes, the
complement whereof is 72 degrees 16 minutes, the angle ACB, which was required.

CHAP. XXIX. To find an angle, by knowing the other oblique angle, and the
side opposite to the angle given.
As the cosine of the side, To the cosine of the angle given: So is the radius,
To the Sine of the angle required.
So in the rectangle ABC, having the angle BAC 37 degrees 30 minutes, and the
side BC 33 degrees 36 minutes, to find the angle ACB: place the thread at the
intersection of the contrary Sine of 56 degrees 24 minutes, (the complement of
BC) with the right sine of 52 degrees 30 minutes (the complement of the angle
BAC) and it will cut the contrary sine of 90 degrees, at the right sine of 72
degrees 16 minutes, the angle ACB, which was required.

CHAP. XXX. To find an angle, hy knowing the base, and the side opposite to
the inquired angle.
AS the sine of the base, To the sine of 90 degrees: So the sine of the side
given, To the sine of the angle required.
Thus in the rectangle ABC, having the base AC 65 degrees 23 minutes, and the
side BC 33 degrees 36 minutes, to find the angle BAC: I place the thread to
the intersection of the contrary sine of 65 degrees 23 minutes, with the right
sine of 90 degrees, and I find it cut the contrary sine of 33 degrees 36
minutes, at the right sine of 37 degrees 30 minutes, the angle BAC which was
required.

Thus far by sines alone; but now we must require joint help of Tangents.

And forasmuch as the Tangents extend but to 45 degrees, which is equal to the
side of the quadrat. I shall set down the two ways for the resolution of each
proposition, delivered by Master Gunter; and if one will not hold, the other
will; observing the rules given to this purpose in the 8 Chapter.

CHAP. XXXI. To find a side, by knowing the other side, and the angle opposite
to the inquired side.
AS the radius, To the sine of the side given: So is the Tangent of the angle,
To the Tangent of the side required.
Or As the sine of the side given, Is to the radius: So the cotangent of the
angle, To the cotangent of the side required.


Thus in the rectangle ABC, having the side AB 60 degrees, and the angle BAC 37
degrees 30 minutes, to find the side BC; I place the thread at the
intersection of the contrary sine of 90 degrees, with the right sine of 60
degrees, and it does cut the contrary Tangent of 37 degrees 30 minutes, at the
right Tangent of 33 degrees 36 minutes, the side BC, which was required.

CHAP. XXXII. To find a side, by knowing the other side, and the angle next to
the inquired side.
AS the Tangent of the angle given, To the Tangent of the side given: So is the
radius, To the sine of the side required.
Or, As the cotangent of the side given, To the cotangent of the angle given;
So is the radius, To the Sine of the side required.


Thus in the rectangle ABC having the side AB 60 degrees, and the angle ACB 72
degrees 16 minutes, it is required to find the side BC. Now here in regard the
given Tangents exceed the side of the quadrat; I let pass the first
proportion, and make use of the second: and opening the thread to the angle of
30 degrees, or which is all one, if I place the thread at the intersection of
the contrary Sine of 90 degrees, with the right Tangent of 30 degrees, (which
is the complement of the side AB) it will cut the right Tangent of 17 degrees
44 minutes, (the complement of the angle ACB) at the contrary (...) 33 degrees
36 minutes, the side BC, or placing the thread at the intersection of the
contrary Tangent of 30 degrees, (the complement of the side AB) with the right
Sine of 90 degrees, it will cut the contrary Tangent of 17 degrees 44 minutes,
(the complement of the angle ACB) at the right sine of 33 degrees 36 minutes,
the side BC. Or if the thread be placed at the intersection of the contrary
Tangent of 30 degrees, with the right Tangent of 17 degrees 44 minutes, it will
cut the contrary Sine of 90 degrees, at the right Sine of 33 degrees 36
minutes, for the side BC, as before, which was required.

CHAP. XXXIII. To find a side by knowing the base, and the angle next to the
inquired side.
AS the radius, To the cosine of the angle given: So is the Tangent of the
base, To the Tangent of the side required.
Or, As the cosine of the angle given, Is to the radius: So is the cotangent of
the base, To the cotangent of the side required.


So in the rectangle ABC, having the base AC 65 degrees 23 minutes, for the
hour from Sunrise; (he having no declination) and the angle BAC 37 degrees 30
minutes, for the complement of the latitude; we may find the Azimuth from the
East, which is the side AB: for if the thread be applied to the intersection of
the contrary Sine of 52 degrees 30 minutes, (which is the complement of the
angle BAC,) with the right Tangent of 24 degrees 37 minutes, (the complement of
the base AC) it shall cut the contrary Sine of 90 degrees at the right Tangent
of 30 degrees, the complement whereof is 60 degrees, the side AB, or the
Azimuth from the East, which was required.

CHAP. XXXIV. To find the base by knowing the oblique angles.
As the Tangent of the one angle, To the cotangent of the other angle: So is
the radius, To the cosine of the base.
Thus in the rectangle ACB, having the angle BAC 37. degrees 30 minutes, and
the angle ACB 72 degrees 16 minutes, to find the base AC: I place the thread
at the intersection of the contrary Tangent of 37 degrees 30 minutes with the
right Sine of 90 degrees, and it will cut the contrary Tangent of 17 degrees 44
minutes, (the complement of the angle ACB) at the right Sine of 24 degrees 37
minutes, the complement whereof is 65 degrees 23 minutes, the base AC, as was
required.

CHAP. XXXV. To find the base, by knowing one of the sides, and the angle next
the same side.

side given, To the cotangent of the base.
Or As the cosine of the angle given, Is to the radius: So the tangent of the
side given, To the tangent of the base required.


Thus in the rectangle ABC, having AB 60 degrees, and the angle BAC 37 degrees
30 minutes, to find the base AC; I place the thread at the intersection of the
contrary Sine of 90 degrees, with the right tangent of 30 degrees, (the
complement of the side AB) and it cutteth the contrary Sine of 52 degrees 30
minutes, (the complement of the angle BAC) at the right tangent of 24 degrees
37 minutes, the complement whereof 56 degrees 23 minutes, is the base AC, which
was required.

CHAP. XXXVI. To find an angle by knowing both the sides.
As the radius, To the Sine of the side next the inquired angle: So is the
cotangent of the opposite side, To the cotangent of the angle required.
Or, As the sine of the side next the inquired angle, Is to the radius: So is
the tangent of the opposite side, To the tangent of the angle required.


Thus in the rectangle ABC, having the side BC 33 degrees 36 minutes, and the
side AB 60 degrees, to find the angle BAC; place the thread upon the
intersection of the contrary Sine of 60 degrees, with the right tangent of 33
degrees 36 minutes, and it shall cut the contrary Sine of 90 degrees, at the
right tangent of 37 degrees 30 minutes, and such is the angle BAC, as was
required.

CHAP. XXXVII. To find an angle, by knowing the base, and the side next to the
inquired angle.
AS the cotangent of the side given, To the cotangent of the base: So is the
radius, To the cosine of the angle required.
Or As the tangent of the base, To the tangent of the side: So is the radius,
To the cosine of the angle required.


Thus in the rectangle ABC, having the base AC 65 degrees 23 minutes, and the
side BC 33 degrees 36 minutes, it is required to find the angle ACB.

Now in regard the tangent of the base is greater then the side of the quadrat,
and the side BC is lesser then the same; I open the thread to an angle equal
with the base, viz. to an angle of 65 degrees 23 minutes, and it will cut the
right tangent of 33 degrees 36 minutes, at the contrary Sine of 17 degrees 44
minutes, the complement whereof being 72 degrees 16 minutes, is the angle ACB
which was required.

CHAP. XXXVIII. To find an angle, by knowing the other oblique angle, and the
base.
AS the radius, To the cosine of the base: So the Tangent of the angle given,
To the cotangent of the angle required.
Or, As the cosine of the base, Is to the radius: So is the cotangent of the
angle given, To the tangent of the angle required.


Thus in the rectangle ABC, having the base AC 65 degrees 23 minutes and the
angle BAC 37 degrees 30 minutes, to find the angle ACB; place the thread at
the intersection of the contrary Sine of 90 degrees, with the right Sine of 24
degrees 37 minutes, (the complement of the base) and it will cut the contrary
tangent of 37 degrees 30 minutes, at the right tangent of 17 degrees 44
minutes, the complement whereof being 72 degrees 16 minutes, is the angle ACB,
which was required.

Thus have we by the Universal quadrat, resolved all the 16 cases of a
rectangle spherical triangle. Now follows the resolution of all manner of
spherical triangles whatsoever.

In any Spherical Triangle whatsoever.
CHAP. XLI. To find a side opposite to an angle given, by knowing one side,
and two angles, the one opposite to the given side, the other to the side
required.
AS the sine of the opposite angle to the side given, Is to the sine of that
side given: So is the sine of the angle opposite to the side required, To the
sine of the side required.
Thus in the following triangle PZS, having the side PZ 37 degrees 30 minutes,
and the angle ZPS 53 degrees 40 minutes with the angle ZSP 34 degrees 47
minutes, we may find the side ZS; for if you apply the thread to the
intersection of the contrary Sine of 34 degrees 47 minutes, with the right Sine
of 37 degrees 30 minutes, it shall cut the contrary Sine of 53 degrees 40
minutes, at the right Sine of 59 degrees 15 minutes, and such is the side ZS,
which was required.

CHAP. XL. To find an angle opposite to a side given, by knowing one angle and
two sides, the one opposite to the given angle, the other to the angle required.
AS the sine of the side opposite to the angle given, Is to the sine of that
angle given: So is the sine of the side opposite to the angle required, To the
sine of the angle required.
Thus in the triangle PZS, having the angle PZS 113 degrees 17 minutes, the
Azimuth from the North; and the side PS 78 degrees 30 minutes, the complement
of the Suns declination; with the side ZS 59 degrees 15 minutes, the complement
of the Suns altitude; we may find the angle ZPS which is the hour from the
meridian: for if we place the thread at the intersection of the contrary sine
of 78 degrees 30 minutes, with the right sine of 66 degrees 43 minutes the
outward angle at Z, (because the inward angle exceeds a quadrant) it will cut
the contrary sine of 59 degrees 15 minutes, at the right sine of 53 degrees 40
minutes, which is the hour from the meridian as was required.

CHAP. XLI. To find an angle by knowing the three sides.
IN respect of the three sides of a not right angled spherical triangle, let
that which subtendeth the angle required be called the base; and the other two
the containing sides.

Then, first, take the sum and difference, of the lesser side and the
complement or excess of the greater side; and add the sines of the said sum
and difference together, the half whereof shall be the first found sine: then
out of the sine of the sum take this first found sine, and note the remainder.

Now if every of the three sides be less then a quadrant, take the difference
between the remainder noted, and the cosine of the base: but if any of the
three sides be greater then a quadrant, add the remainder noted to the cosine
or excess of the base; so shall the sum or difference be the second found
sine. Then say, As the first found sine, To the second sound sine: So is the
radius, To a fourth fine.


Now when every side of the triangle is less then a quadrant; if the remainder
noted be less then the cosine of the base, the arch of this fourth sine must
be taken out of 90 degrees but if the remainder noted, be greater then the
cosine of the base, then add the arch of this fourth sine to 90 degrees, so
shall the sum or difference be the angle required.

But when one side is greater then a quadrant, and that side be made the base;
then always add this fourth arch to 90 degrees, to make up your angle required.

And if the side exceeding a quadrant be one of the containing sides, then
always take this fourth arch out of 90 degeees, and the remainder shall be the
angle required.

As in the triangle ZPS, having the side ZP, the complement of the latitude 37
degrees 30 minutes, and the side PS the complement of the declination 78
degrees 30 minutes with the base ZS the complement of the Suns altitude 59
degrees 15 minutes, we may find the angle ZPS, the hour of the day.

For the side ZP, the complement of the latitude being 37 degrees 30 minutes,
and the complement of the side PS, the declination of the Sun, being 11 degrees
30 minutes, their sum is 49 degrees 00 minutes, and their difference 26 degrees
00 minutes, and if we put the side of the quadrat 1000, the sine of the sum 49
degrees 00 minutes, is 754, and the sine of the difference 26 degrees 00
minutes, is 438, these two sines joined together is 1192, the half whereof is
596 for the first found sine, which taken out of the sine of the sum leaves
158, which remainder I note, and because either of these sides is less then a
quadrant, I take the difference between this remainder noted and the sine of
the complement of the base ZS being 30 degrees 45 minutes, the sine whereof is
511, out of which I take the remainder noted, and the remainder is 353, for the
second found sine; then placing the thread at the intersection of the contrary
parallel of 596, with the right parallel of 353, it will cut the contrary sine
of 90 degrees, at the right sine of 36 degrees 20 minutes, and in regard the
sides are all less then quadrants, and the remainder noted, less then the
cosine of the base, I take this 36 degrees 20 minutes, out of 90 degrees, and
there rests 53 degrees 40 minutes, for the hour from the meridian which was
required. The like may you do with any of the other angles, as to find the
Azimuth, or the angle of the Suns position in regard of Pole and Zenith.

But you shall have a more speedy way to perform this problem, by the
Planisphere on the back of the quadrat; for by knowing the three sides of any
spherical Triangle, you shall find an angle as spedily as if you had the other
two angles also.

CHAP. XLII. To find a side by knowing the three angles.
IN any spherical Triangle the sides may be changed into angles, and the angles
into sides: by taking first for any one angle and his subtending side, the
remainder to a semicircle: then shall the operation be the same, as in the
former Chapter.

Thus in the Triangle ZPS, having the angle ZPS 53 degrees 40 minutes, and ZSP
34 degrees 47 minutes, with S ZP 113 degrees 17 minutes, if you take the
greater angle of 113 degrees 17 minutes, out of 180 degrees, there will remain
66 degrees 43 minutes, then as if you had a Triangle of three known sides, one
of 53 degrees 40 minutes, another of 34 degrees 47 minutes, and a third of 66
degrees 43 minutes, you may find an angle opposite to any one of these sides
by the last Chapter. So shall the angle thus found, be the side required, if it
be not the angle opposite to that side which was made by substraction from 180
degrees, if it shall be that angle, then take it likewise from 180 degrees, and
the remainder shall be the side required.

CHAP. XLIII. To find a side, by knowing the other two sides, and the angle
contained by them.
HEre, first, let down a perpendicular, the which you may perform by the 23
Chapter, so shall the Triangle angle given be reduced into two right angled
triangles Thus in the Triangle ZPS, having ZP the complemen of the latitude,
and PS the complement of declination with ZPS the angle of the hour from the
meridian, we may find S Z the complement of the Suns altitude.

For having let down the perpendicular Z X by the 23 Chapter: we have two
Triangles ZXP, and ZXS, both right angled at X, then may we find the side PX,
either by the 24, 32, or 33, Chapters, which taken out of PS, leaves the side
XS: now with this side XS, and the perpendicular ZX, we may find the base ZS
by the 26 Chapter.

Or if you let down the perpendicular SA, you shall have two right angled
Triangles, viz. SA Z, and SAP, then having the base PS, and the perpendicular
SA you may by the 24, or 32 or 33 Chapters find the side AP, from which if you
take ZP, there will remain ZA: then with the sides AZ, and AS, you may by the
26 Chapter, find the base ZS.

CHAP. XLIV. To find a side by knowing the other two sides, and one angle next
the inquired side.
THus in the Triangle ZPS, having the side ZP the complement of the latitude,
and PS the complement of the declination, with P ZS the angle of the Azimuth,
we may find the side ZS the complement of the Suns altitude. For having ZP,
and the angle at Z, we may to S Z produced, let down the perpendicular PB by
the 23 Chapter: then have we two right angled Triangles, PB Z, and PBS, then by
the 24 Chapter, having the base PS of the Triangle PBS, and the perpendicular
PB, we may find the side BS; and by the base P Z, of the Triangle PBZ, and the
same perpendicular PB, we may find the side B Z which being taken out of BS
leaves ZS for the side required.

CHAP. XLV. To find a side, by knowing one side, and the two angles next the
inquired side.
THus in the Triangle PZS, having PS the declination of the Sun, and PZS, the
angle of the Azimuth, and ZP S the angle of the hour from the meridian, we may
find the side ZP the complement of the latitude.

For if by the 23 Chapter, we let down the perpendicular SA, we shall have two
right angled Triangles, SA Z, and SA P, then by the 24 Chapter, having the base
PS, of the Triangle SAP, with the perpendicular SA, we may find the side AP;
and by the angle SZA, of the triangle SA Z, and the same perpendicular SA, we
may find the side A Z by the 32 Chapter, which being taken out of AP leaves
ZP the side required.

CHAP. XLVI. To find a side by knowing two angles, and the side enclosed by
them.
THus in the triangle ZPS, having the angles at Z and P, with the side
intercepted ZP, we may find the side PS, for having by the 23 Chap. let down
the perpendicular PB, we have two right angles PBZ, and PBS, then may we by the
29, or 37, or 38, Chap. find the angle BPZ, which added to the angle ZPS
gives the angle BPS, then with this angle BPS, and the perpendicular BP, we
may find the base PS, according to the 35 Chapter.

CHAP. XLVII. To find an angle by knowing the other two angles, and the side
enclosed by them.
THus in the triangle ZPS, having the angles at Z and P with the side
intercepted ZP, we may find the other angle ZSP, for having by the 23 Chapter,
let down the perpendicular ZX, we have two right angled triangles ZXP, and ZXS;
then may we find the angle PZX, by the 37 or 38 Chapter, and that taken out of
the angle PZS leaves the angle SZX: then with the angle SZX, and the
perpendicular ZX, we may find the angle required ZSX, according to the 28
Chapter.

CHAP. XLVIII. To find an angle, by knowing the other two angles, and one of
the sides next the inquired angle.
THus in the triangle ZPS, having the angles at P, and S, with the side ZP, we
may find the angle PZS, for by the 23 Chapter having let down the
perpendicular ZX we have two right angled triangles, PXZ, and SXZ, then may we
by the 37 or 38 Chapter, find the angles PZX, and SXZ, which being both added
together makes the angle PZS which was required.

CHAP. XLIX. To find an angle, by knowing two sides, and the angle contained
by them.
THus having the sides ZP, and P S, in the triangle ZPS, with the angle
comprehended ZPS, we may find the angle PZS, for having let down the
perpendicular AS, by the 23 Chapter, we have two right angled triangles SAZ,
and SAP; then may we by the 14, or 32, or 33 Chapters, find the side AP, out
of which if we take ZP, there will remain AZ: with which side AZ, and the
perpendicular SA, we may find the angle AZS, by the 36 Chapter, this angle
AZS, taken out of 180 degrees, leaves the angle PZS, which was required.

CHAP. L. To find an angle, by knowing the two sides next it, and one of ahe
other angles.
THus in the triangle ZPS, having the sides ZP, and PS, with the angle PZS, we
may find the angle ZPS for having let down the perpendicular PB by the 23
Chapter, we have two right angled triangles PBZ, and PBS; then may we by the
37, or 38 Chapter find the angles BPZ, and BPS; and taking B PZ, out of B PS,
there remains the angle Z PS, which was required.

Thus you may see Master Gunters 28 cases of a spherical triangles, which he
applied to his sector, all resolved by the foreside of ray Universal quadrat.
And now you she see them more speedily performed, by the moveable planisphere
on the back of the Quadrat; coming something near to that of Mr. Blagraves
Jewel. But whereas he for the making up of his triangles, uses his dark and
intricate reete, (which is no small let to to the eye, for beholding of the
true intersections upon the Jewel,) I shall only use a fine thread, which may
always hang in the center on the foreside, to serve redily for the aforesaid
work, and being of a reasonable length, will be as useful for this side too.

CHAP. LI. In a right angled triangle, having the base and one of the oblique
angles, to find the two sides, and the other angle.
LEt the triangle ABC be given again, being the same right angled triangle as
was given in the 23 Chapter, wherein knowing the base AC to be 65 degrees. 23 min.
and the angle BAC, to be 37 degrees. 30 min. let it be required to find the sides
AB, and BC, with the angle ACB.

First move the sphere about, until the horizon cut the degrees. of the angle given
upon the limb, counted from the equinoctial point, viz. 37 degrees. 30 min. which
resting in this position, count the base AC 65 degrees. 23 min. from the center
upon the horizon; and where this sum ends, there the horizon cutteth the
parallel of 33 degrees. 36 min. which is the side BC subtending the given angle
BAC, and farther, at this intersection of 65 degrees. 23 min. on the Horizon, with
the parallel of 33 degrees. 36 min. does meet the sixtieth meridian, which is the
side AC next to the given angle at A, and here you may see your whole triangle
upon your Instrument, as plainly as on the sphere it self, included by these
three arches, viz. 65 degrees. 23 min. on the Horizon, and 60 degrees. in the
Equinoctial, and 33 degrees. 36 min. upon the said sixtieth meridian, and for the
angles, that at the intersection of the meridians with the Equator must needs
be right, the given angle is placed id the center, and denominated by the
Horizon upon the limb; the other rests to be found. And thus of the six parts
of a right angled triangle, five is in open view.

diagram of the measurement of a spherical triangle (ABC)

But now to find the other angle subtended by the side AB, exchange the places
of the sides, and let that which was counted upon the Equator amongst the
meridians, be counted amongst the parallels; then moving the planisphere until
the base 65 degrees. 23 min. counted on the Horizon, meet with the parallel of 60
degrees. the side AB subgnidnet rending the angle required: so shall the Horizon
cut the limb at the angle required, counted from the Equator. And here is your
triangle made up as before, viz. The base 65 degrees. 23 min. on the Horizon, the
side BC 33 degrees. 36 min. on the Equator, and 60 degrees. the side AB amongst the
parallels.

CHAP. LII. By knowing the base and one of the sides, to find the other side,
with both the oblique angles.
THus in the right angled triangle ABC, having the base AC 65 degrees. 23 min. and
the side BC 33 degrees-36 min. we may find the other side AB, and the two oblique
angles at A and C.

For if you count the base AC 65 degrees. 23 min. upon the Horizon, and the side BC
33 degrees. 36 min. among the parallels; and then move the planisphere to and fro,
until the 65 degrees. 23 min. do cut the parallel of 33 degrees. 36 min. counted from
the Equinoctial, and there shall meet you the 60 meridian to make up your
triangle; which 60 degrees is the required side AB, and now at this very
instant you may see the Horizon cut the limb at 37 degrees. 30 min. which is one
of the angles required, viz. the angle BAC. And now for to find the other
angle you must shift the sides as in the last Chap. for the side subtending the
angle required, must be counted among the parallels.

Thus moving about the planisphere til the intersection of the sixtieth
parallel and meridian of 33 degrees. 36 min. do cut the Horizon, which will be at
65 degrees. 23 min. the base AC as before, and now does the horizon cut the limb
at 72 degrees. 16 min. which is the angle ACB as was required.

CHAP. LIII. Having one side, and one of the oblique angles of a right angled
triangle, to find the base, the other side, and the other oblique angle
AS in the right angled triangle ABC, having the angle BAC 37 degrees. 30 min. and
the side AB 60 degrees. we may find the base AC, and the side BC, with the angle
ACB.

For if you move about the planisphere, until the Horizon cut upon the limb,
the degrees of the angle given, viz. 37 degrees. 30 min. and then reckon the side
given viz. 60 degrees. upon the Equator among the meridians; you shall upon the
same 60 meridian, find 33 degrees. 36 min. intercepted between the equator and
horizon; which 33 degrees. 36 min. is the side BC subtending the given angle BAC.

Now for to find the base, mark where the said sixtieth meridian cutteth the
horizon, which is at 65 degrees. 23 min. and such is the base AC. As was required.
And for to find the other oblique angle, you may shift the sides, as was
showed in the two last Chapters.

CHAP. LIVE. Having the two sides of a right angled triangle, to find the base,
and the two oblique angles
AS in the right angled triangle ABC, having the two sides AB 60 degrees. and BC 33
degrees. 36 min. we may find the base AC, and the two oblique angles A and C.

For if we count the two sides one among the meridians, and the other amongst
the parallels; as here 60 degrees. among the meridians, and 33 degrees. 36 min. amongst
the parallels; and then turn the planisphere about, until their intersection
cut the Horizon, we shall have thereon cut 65 degrees. 23 min. for the base AC. and
the Horizon also cutting 37 degrees 30 min. on the limb which is the angle BAC,
subtended by the side BC, which was counted amongst the parallels.

Thus have you the base, and one of the angles required, and the other is soon
found by shifting the sides as in the 51 and 52 Chapters.

CHAP. LV. Having the two oblique angles, of a right angled Triangle, to find
a side opposite to either of them.
LEt the right angled Triangle ABC be given, wherein the two oblique angles A
and C are known, viz. the angle BAC 37 degrees 30 minutes, and the angle ACB 72
degrees 16 minutes, and let it be required to find the two sides AB and BC.

First, place the planisphere so that the two poles thereof may both lie in the
Horizon, so shall the Equator be in the zenith. This done, count the angle next
the side required, amongst the parallels to the Equator, from any of the poles
inward, and the angle subtended by the side required, among the almicanters,
counted from the zenithward downward on both sides, upon which points place the
thread, which by this means lies parallel to the Horizon. Now where the thread
crosses the former parallel, there passes by the meridian which gives you
the angle required, counted from the limb.

As for example, both poles being in the Horizon, I count the angle ACB 72 degrees.
16 min. among the parallels, and the angle BAC 37 degrees. 30 min. among the
Almicanters, being both counted from the limb, then applying the thread to the
said Almicanter, I find it cut the aforesaid parallel, at the meridian of 33
degrees. 36 min. which is the side BC which was required.

Now for to find the other side, let the poles remain in the Horizon, and
apply the thread to the Almicanter of 72 degrees. 16 min. counted from the zenith,
and you shall see it cut the parallel of 37 degrees. 30 min. counted from the
poles, as the sixtieth meridian counted from the limb, and such is the side AB
as was required.

CHAP. LVI. Having the three sides of any spherical Triangle, to find an angle
opposite to any of them.
LEt the Triangle ZPS be given, whereof the three sides are all known, and the
three angles all unknown. First, therefore let the planisphere be so placed,
that one of the sides next the angle required, be contained between the pole
and zenith. Or place the sphere so that the Horizon may cut upon the limb, the
degrees of one of the sides containing the angle required, which is all one
thing, this being done count the other containing side from the pole among the
parallels; and the side subtending the angle required, always from the zenith
amongst the almicanters, and thereto place the thread now where the thread
cutteth the parallel of the second containing side, there passes by the
meridian which gives you the angle required, counted from the limb.

Thus in the Triangle Z PS, having ZP the complement of the latitude, and PS
the complement of the Suns declination, with ZS the complement of the Suns
altitude, we may find the angle of the hour from the meridian ZPS.

For having placed the Horizon to the complement of the latitude 37 degrees. 30
min. the side ZP, and counted the complement of declination 78 degrees. 30 min.
from the pole among the parallels of declination, or the declination it self
from the Equator 11 degrees. 30 min. and also 59 degrees. 15 min. amongst the
almicanters from the zenith which is the side ZS, or the complement of the Suns
altitude from the Horizon, and, thereto applied the thread parallel to the
Horizon; it shall cut the parallel of declination at the meridian or hour
circle of 53 degrees. 40 min. from the limb or general meridian, and such is the
angle ZPS, which was required.

In like manner may we find the angle PZS which is the Azimuth from the North,
for letting the sphere rest as before, with the side ZP at the Horizon; if we
count the side ZS 59 degrees. 15 min. among the parallels counted from the pole,
and the side PS 78 degrees. 30 min. from the zenith amongst the almicanters, and
thereto apply the thread parallel to the Horizon, it shall cut the said
parallel of 59 degrees. 15 min. at the meridian of 113 degrees. 17 min. for in this
manner of work, the angles are all counted from the South part of the limb.
This 113 degrees. 17 min. is the angle PZS, which was required.

Then for to find the third angle, you may shift the sides, placing one of the
other sides at the Horizon, and then proceed as before.

Thus you may see this proposition which is most useful, but withal most
difficult of all others, (as in Arithmetique, so by the Sector and
Crosse-staffe, and also by the fore-side of this Universal Quadrat) speedily
performed by the planisphere on the back of this quadrat.

CHAP. LVII. To find a side, by knowing the other two sides, and the angle
comprehended.
FIrst, set the Horizon to one of the given sides, counted on the limb from the
Equator, and count the other side from the pole among the parallels, then count
the given angle amongst the meridians from the limb; and at the point of
intersection between that meridian and the parallel, there place the thread
parallel to the Horizon; which you may do by help of the almicanters, and note
what almicanter the thread so cutteth, for that is the third side counted from
the zenith.

As in the Triangle ZPS, having the sides ZP 37 degrees. 30 min. ZS 59 degrees. 15 min.
with the angle PZS 113 degrees 17 min. we may find the side PS, for first I
place the Horizon at 37 degrees. 30 min. and count the other side ZS 59 degrees. 15
min. from the pole among the parallels, and the angle PZS 113 degrees. 17 min.
among the meridians from the south part of the limb, and where this meridian of
113 degrees. 17 min. cutteth the parallel of 59 degrees. 15 min. there I place the
thread parallel to the Horizon, and I find it to cut the Almicanters at 78
degrees. 30 min. from the zenith, and such is the side SP, which was required.

Thus having all three sides, you may find any of the other two angles by the
last Chapter.

CHAP. LVIII. To find a side, by knowing the other two sides, and one of the
angles next the inquired side.
FIrst, set the Horizon to that side given, which is next the given angle,
counting on the limb from the Equator; then place the thread (parallel to the
Horizon) upon the other side counted from the zenith amongst the Almicanters;
now where the thread intersecteth the angle given counted among the meridians
from the limb, there passes by the parallel of the side required counted from
the pole.

As in the Triangle ZPS, having the side ZP the complement of the latitude 37
degrees. 30 min. and the side PS the complement of the declination 78 degrees. 30 min.
with the angle PZS, the azimuth from the North 113 degrees. 17 min. we may find
the side ZS the complement of latitude.

For if we place the Horizon to the side ZP 37 degrees. 30 min. from the Equator in
the limb, and then place the thread to the almicanter of 78 degrees. 30 min.
counted from the zenith, it shall cut the meridian of 113 degrees. 17 min. from the
limb, at the parallel of 59 degrees. 15 min. counted from the pole, and such is the
side ZS, which was required.

CHAP. LIX. Having two sides and one angle, to find any of the other two
angles.
FIrst, find the third side by one of the two last Chap. then having all three
sides you may by the 56 Chap. find any angle required.

Here needs no example more then what those Chapters affords.

CHAP. LX. Having either all three angles to find a side, or having two angles
and one side, to find any of the other two sides.
TO find a side by knowing the three angles, you must first convert the angles
into sides by the 42 Chap. which being done, you may by the 56 Chap. find an
angle opposite to any one of these sides; so shall the angle which is thus
found, be the side which is here required. As in the said 42 Chap. so likewise
having two angles and one side, you may by the said 42 Chap. convert these
angles into sides, and the sides into angles; so shall you have two sides and
one angle, by which and the 57 or 58 Chapters, you may find a third side, then
having all three sides, you may by the 56 Chap. find an angle opposite to any
of them, which angle thus found, shall be the side required

The end of the second Book.
The Third Book.
Showing how by the Universal Quadrat, to resolve all such Astronomical
propositions, as are of ordinary use, as well in the art of Navigation, as in
the art of Dialling, with the resolution of such nautical propositions, as are
of ordinary use amongst Seamen, concerning Longitude, Latitude, Rumb, and
distance.
CHAP. I. To find the Suns altitude, by the shadow of a Gnomon set
perpendicular to the Horizon.
TO perform this Conclusion, place the thread upon the intersection of the
contrary parallel of the shadow, with the right parallel of the Gnomon, so
shall it show in the quadrant, the Suns altitude required.

As for example, let AB in the following diagram, be the Gnomon or substance
yielding shadow, which we will suppose to be 60, and let AC be the length of
the shadow, here found to be 45 such parts as the Gnomon is 60. Now placing the
thread upon the intersection of the contrary parallel of 45, with the right
parallel of 60, it will cut in the Quadrant 53 degrees. 8 min. and such is the
angle ACB, the Altitude of the Sun required.

Or if the shadow had been AD which here is found to be 80, if you place the
thread at the intersection of the right parallel of 60, with the contrary
parallel of 80, it will cut in the Quadrant 36 degrees. 52 min. and such is the
angle ADB the altitude of the Sun required.

CHAP. II. The height of the Sun being given, to find the length of the right
shadow.
BY right shadow is meant the shadow of any Staff, Post, Steeple, or any
Gnomon whatsoever, that stands at right angles with the Horizon, the one end
thereof respecting the Zenith of the place, and the other the Nadir.

Wherefore place the thread to the height of the Sun given in the Quadrant, and
it shall cut the right parallel of the Gnomon, at the contrary parallel of the
shadow.

Let the Suns height given be 53 degrees. 8 min. and the length of the Gnomon 60
wherefore if you place the thread at 53 degrees. 8 min. in the Quadrant, it will
cut the right parallel of 60, at the contrary parallel of 45, and such is the
length of the right shadow AC, which was required.

Or if the Suns height be but 36 degrees. 52 min. if you place the thread to 36
degrees. 52 min. in the Quadrant, it will cut the right parallel of 60, at the
contrary parallel of 80, and such is the length of the right shadow AD which
was required.

CHAP. III. To find the Altitude of the Sun by the shadow of a Gnomon,
standing at right angles with any perpendicular wall; in such manner that it
may lie parallel to the Horizon.
HEre if you place the thread to the intersection of the contrary parallel of
the Gnomon, with the right parallel of the shadow, it shall cut the quadrant at
the Suns altitude required.

As for example, let AB in the next Chapter be some perpendicular wall, AC a
Gnomon making right angles therewith, whose length is 60, and let AD be the
length of the shadow which is here found to be 80: now if you place the thread
to the intersection of the contrary parallel of 60, with the right parallel of
80, it will cut in the Quadrant 5; degrees. 8 min. and such is the angle ACD the
altitude of the Sun required.

CHAP. IV. The Height of the Sun being given, to find the length of the
contrary shadow.
BY the contrary shadow is understood the length of any shadow that is made by
a Staff or Gnomon, standing at right angles against any perpendicular wall, in
such a manner that it may lie parallel to the Horizon; the length of the
contrary shadow does increase as the Sun rises in height; whereas the right
shadow does decrease in length, as the Sun does increase in height.

Wherefore to find the length of the versed shadow, place the thread upon the
height of the Sun given in the Quadrant, and it will cut the contrary parallel
of the Gnomon, at the right parallel of the shadow.

diagram of the measurement of length of the sun's shadow

Let AB be a perpendicular wall, AC a Gnomon making right angles there with,
the length whereof is 60, and the Suns Altitude 53 degrees. 8 min. the angle ACD;
now if you place the thread at 53 degrees. 8 min. in the quadrant, it will cut the
contrary parallel of 60, at the right parallel of 80, and such is the length of
the contrary shadow AD which was required.

CHAP. V. Having the distance of the Sun from the next Equinoctial point, to
find his declination.
AS the Radius is in proportion, To the sine of the Suns greatest declination:
So the Sine of the Suns distance from the next equinoctial point, To the sine
of the declination required.
Thus in the right angled spherical triangle X in the following Diagram, having
the base 30 degrees. (which is the Suns distance from the Equinoctial point, he
being in the beginning of;) and the angle X 23 degrees 30 minutes (the angle of
the Suns greatest declination) with the right angle at X, we may find the side
X, the declination required.

For if we place the thread at the intersection of the contrary sine of 90
degrees, with the right sine of 23 degrees 30 minutes, it will cut the contrary
sine of 30 degrees. at the right sineof of 11 degrees. 30 minutes.

Or if we place the thread at the intersection of the contrary sine of 90 degrees.
with the right sine of 30 degrees. it will cut the contrary sine of 23 degrees. 30 min.
at the right sine of 11 degrees. 30 min. and so much is the side X, the declination
of the Sun in the beginning of, which was required. The like declination has
the beginning of,, and, all being of equal distance from their next equinoctial
points; the like holds of all the other points of the Ecliptic; so that
having the declination of every degree in one quarter all the rest are known.

CHAP. VI. How to find the latitude of a place, or the Poles elevation above
the Horizon, the declination of the Sun being given.
FIrst, you must get the Suns meridian altitude, the which you may very well do
by this Instrument after this manner; hold the superficies of your Instrument
perpendicular to the Horizon, and the center where the thread and plummet
hangs toward the Sun; then lifting up the quadrat toward the Sun, until his
beams pass through both his sights at once, the thread will cut in the quadrant
the degrees of the Suns altitude. This observation you must begin a little
before noon, still diligently observing until you perceive the Sun to begin to
fall again, then marking what was his greatest altitude, will serve for this
our present purpose.

Having gotten the meridian altitude by this, and the declination by the last
Chapter, you may find the elevation of the Pole above the Horizon as
follows. If the Sun have North declination, then substract the declination
out of the meridian altitude; but if the Sun has South declination, then add
the declination to the meridian altitude, so shall the sum or difference be the
height of the Equinoctial; which being taken out of the quadrant or 90 degrees,
leaves the elevation of the Pole above the Horizon.

As for example, upon the ninth of April 1652, the meridian altitude of the
Sun, was observed to be AG 49 degrees, upon which day I find the Sun by my
Ephemeris to be in the beginning of, and so his declination by diagram of the
measurement of latitude and polar elevation the last Chapter, to be 11 degrees
30 minutes, the arch X, or EG equal to it; and in regard his declination is
North, I take EG 11 degrees 30 minutes out of AG 49 degrees, the meridian
altitude, and there remains 37 degrees 30 minutes, the arch AE for the height
of the Equinoctial; the complement whereof is EZ 52 degrees 30 minutes, the
latitude of the place, or BP, which is equal to it, being the elevation of the
Pole above the Horizon.

CHAP. VII. How to get the Declination of the Sun, or any Star, Planet, or
Comet by observation in a known latitude.
FIrst, take the latitude out of 90 degrees, and the remainder will be the
height of the Equinoctial, this being known, take the meridian altitude of the
Sun or any Star, or Planet by the last Chapter, which if it be found greater
then the Equinoctials height, then to us that live on this side the
Equinoctial, the Sun or Star shall have North Declination, if less, it shall be
South: therefore take the lesser height out of the greater, the remainder is
your desire.

As for example, our latitude ZE, or Poles elevation BP, is 52 degrees 30
minutes, the complement whereof is AE 37 degrees 30 minutes, the height of the
Equinoctial, now the meridian altitude of the Sun being found to be 49 degrees,
as in the last Chapter, if you take AE 37 degrees 30 minutes, out of AG 49
degrees, there will rest EG 10 degrees 30 minutes, and so much is the
declination of the Sun from the Equinoctial, and that Northwards, because his
height was greater then the Equinoctial; and so you may do with any Star, to
get his declination, if he comes upon the Meridian on the South side of the
Zenith.

But if it be such a Star as comes not on the South side of the Zenith, by
reason of his great North declination, his Meridian altitude may be Northwards
twice taken, once above the Pole, and again under it. For the declination of
these Stars, take the latitude out of the greatest meridian altitude, or the
lesser meridian altitude out of the latitude, and the remainder out of 90
degrees, there rests then the declination sought for.

CHAP. VIII. The Declination of the Sun, and the quarter of the Ecliptique
which he possesses being given, to find his true place.
AS the Sine of the Suns greatest Declination, to the sine of the Declination
given: So is the Radius, To the sine of the Suns distance from the next
Equinoctial point.
Thus in the Spherical triangle, X,, in the the Diagram of the 6th. Chapter,
having the side X 11 degrees. 30 minutes, the declination given, and the angle X,
the angle of the Suns greatest declination 23 degrees. 30 minutes with the right
angle at X, we may find the base,, the distance of the Sun from the
Equinoctial point, by the 27 Chapter of the last Book.

For if you place the thread upon the intersection of the contrary sine of 23
degrees 30 minutes, with the right sine of 11 degrees 30 minutes, it will cut
the contrary sine of 90 degrees at the right sine of 30 degrees, and so much is
the base,, the distance of the Sun from the Equinoctial point, which was
required.

CHAP. IX. Having the latitude of the place, and the distance of the Sun from
the next Equinoctial point, to find his Amplitude.
AS the Cosine of the latitude, To the sine of the Suns greatest declination:
So the sine of the place of the Sun, To the sine of the amplitude.
Thus in the right lined Triangle T, in the diagram of the 6 Chap. having the
complement of the latitude the angle T, 37 degrees. 30 min. and the Suns greatest
declination the angle T, 23 degrees. 30 min. with the Suns distance from the
Equinoctial point the side, 30 degrees. we may find the side T, the Amplitude by
the 39 Chap. of the foregoing Book.

For if we place the thread to the intersection of the contrary sine of 37 degrees.
30 min. with the right sine of 23 degrees. 30 min. it will cut the contrary sine of
30 degrees. at the right sine of 19 degrees. 7 min. and such is the side T, the
Amplitude required.

CHAP. X. Having the Latitude of the place, and the declination of the Sun or
Star to find his Amplitude.
AS the cosine of the Latitude, To the sine of the declination: So is the
radius, To the sine of the Amplitude.
Thus in the right Triangle QT, in the diagram of the 6 Chap. having the
complement of the Latitude, the angle TRQ, 37 degrees, 30 min. and the side TQ, the
Suns declination 11 degrees. 30 min. with the right angle at Q, we may find the
base, T, the Suns amplitude by the 27 Chap. of the second Book.

For if we place the thread to the intersection of the contrary sine of 37 degrees.
30 min. with the right sine of 11 degrees. 30 min. it will cut the contrary sine of
90 degrees. at the right sine of 19 degrees. 7 min. and such is the base T, the Suns
Amplitude required. The like may you do with any star whose declination you
know.

As for example, the declination of Arcturus this present year 1652 is known to
be 21 degrees. 10 min. North; wherefore I place the thread to the intersection of
the contrary sine of 37 degrees. 30 min. with the right sine of 21 degrees. 10 min. and
I find it to cut the contrary sine of 90 degrees. at the right sine of 36 degrees. 23
min. and such is the Amplitude of Arcturus, and that Northward, because his
declination is to wards the North pole.

CHAP. XI. Having the amplitude and declination of the Sun, to find the
elevation of the Pole above the Horizon.
AS the sine of the Amplitude, To the sine of the declination: So is the
radius, To the cosine of the latitude.
Thus in the right angled Triangle QT, in the Diagram of the 6 Chap. having the
Amplitude the base T, 19 degrees. 7 min. and the side TQ, the declination of the
Sun 11 degrees. 30 min. with the right angle at Q, we may find the complement of
the Latitude the angle TQ, by the 30 Chap. of the second Book.

For if we place the thread at the intersection of the contrary sine of 19 degrees.
7 min. with the right sine of 11 degrees. 30 min. it will cut the contrary sine of
90 degrees. at the right sine of 37 degrees. 30 min. and such is the complement of the
Latitude the angle TQ, which being taken out of 90 degrees. leaves 52 degrees. 30 min.
for the angle PB, the elevation of the pole above the horizon which was
required.

CHAP. XII. The elevation of the Pole, and the amplitude of the Sun being
given, to find his declination.
AS the radius, To the sine of the Amplitud: So is the cosine of the Latitude,
To the sine of the declination.
Thus in the right angled Triangle QT, having the angle TQ the complement of
the Latitude 37 degrees. 30 min. and the base T the Suns Amplitude 19 degrees. 7 min.
with the right angle at Q, we may find the side TQ the declination by the 23
Chap. of the second Book.

For if we place the thread upon the intersection of the contrary sine of 90
degrees. with the right sine of 19 degrees. 7 min. it will cut the contrary sine of 37
degrees. 30 min. at the right sine of 11 degrees. 30 min. and so much is the side TQ
the declination required.

The like may be done by any Star whose Amplitude is known.

CHAP. XIII. Having the Latitude of the place, and the declination of the Sun,
to find his height in the vertical circle, or when he shall come to be due
East or West.
AS the sine of the Latitude, To the sine of the declination: So is the radius,
To the sine of the Altitude.
Thus in the right angled Triangle CD, in the diagram of the 6 Chap. having the
angle CD the Latitude of the place 52 degrees. 30 min. and the side CD the
declination of the Sun 11 degrees. 30 min. with the right angle at D, we may find
the base C the Suns height in the East or West points by the 27 Chap. of the
second Book. For if we apply the thread to the intersection of the contrary
sine of 52 degrees. 30 min. with the right sine of 11 degrees. 30 min. it will cut the
contrary sine of 90 degrees. at the right sine of 14 degrees. 33 min. and such is the
base C the Suns height when he comes to be due East or West as was required.

CHAP. XIV. Having the latitude of the place, and the distance of the Sun from
the Equinoctial point, to find his height in the vertical circle.
AS the sine of the Latitude, To the sine of the Suns greatest declination: So
the sine of his distance from the Equinoctial point, To the sine of his
Altitude.
Thus in the Triangle C, having the outward angle C the latitude of the place
52 degrees. 30 min. and the angle C the angle of the Suns greatest declination 23
degrees 30 min. with the side the Suns distance from the Equinoctial point 30 degrees.
we may find the Suns height in the Vertical circle, the side C by the 39 Chap.
of the second Book.

For if we place the thread upon the intersection of the contrary sine of 52
degrees. 30 min. with the right sine of 23 degrees. 30 min. it will cut the contrary
sine of 30 degrees. at the right sine of 14 degrees. 33 min. and so much is the side C
the Suns height when he comes to be due East or West as was required.

CHAP. XV. Having the Latitude of the place, and the declination of the Sun, to
find the time when the Sun comes to be due East or West.
AS the Tangent of the latitude, To the Tangent of the declination: So is the
radius, To the sine of the time from the hour of six.
Thus in the right angled Triangle CD in the Diagram of the 6 Chap. having the
angle CD the latitude of the place 52 degrees. 30 min. and the side CD the
declination of the Sun 11 degrees. 30 min. with the right angle at D, we may find
the side D, which denominateth the angle PD, (and is the distance of time
betwixt the hour of six, and the Suns coming to the East or West points) by
the 32 Chap. of the second Book, compared with the 8 Chap of the same, For if
we place the thread to the angle of 52 degrees 30 min. it shall cut the right
Tangent of 11 degrees. 30 min. at the contrary sine of about 9 degrees. and such is the
side D which was required.

CHAP. XVI. Having the Latitude of the place, and the declination of the Sun,
to find what altitude the Sun shall have at the hour of six.
AS the sine of 90 degrees, To the sine of the declination: So is the sine of
the Latitude, To the sine of the altitude.
Thus in the right angled Triangle TO in the Diagram of the 6 Chap. having the
base O the declination of the Sun 11 degrees. 30 min. and the angle OR the latitude
of the place 52 degrees. 30 min. with the right angle at R, we may find the side
OR the Suns Altitude at six by the 23 Chap. of the second Book.

For if we place the thread to the intersection of the contrary sine of 90 degrees.
with the right sine of 11 degrees. 30 min. it will cut the contrary sine of 52 degrees.
30 min. at the right sine of 9 degrees. 6 min. and such is the side TO the Suns
altitude at the hour of six which was required.

CHAP. XVII. Having the latitude of the place, and the declination of the Sun,
to find what Azimuth the Sun shall have at the hour of six.
AS the radius, To the cosine of the Latitude: So is the tangent of
declination, To the Tangent of the Azimuth from the East or West points
Northwards.
Thus in the triangle TO in the diagram of the 6 Chap. having the angle OR the
latitude of the place 52 degrees. 30 min. and the base O the declination of the Snn
11 degrees. 30 min. with the right angle R, we may find the side R the Azimuth by
the 33 Chap. of the second Book.

For if we place the thread upon the intersection of the contrary sine of 90
degrees, with the right Tangent of 11 degrees. 30 min. it will cut the contrary sine of
37 degrees. 30 min. at the right Tangent of 7 degrees. 4 min. and such is the side R,
the Azimuth from the East or West points Northward at the hour of six which
was required.

CHAP. XVIII. Having the Latitude of the place, and the declination of the Sun,
to find the Ascensional difference; and thereby the Time of Sunrising and
setting, with the diurnal and nocturnal arches.
AS the cotangent of the Latitude, To the Tangent of the declination: So is the
radius, To the sine of the Ascensional difference.
Thus in the right angled Triangle QT in the diagram of the 6 Chap. having the
angle TQ the complement of the latitude 37 degrees. 30 min. and the side QT the
declination of the Sun 11 degrees. 30 min. with the right angle at Q, we may find
the side Q by the 32 Chap. of the second Book.

For if we place the thread at the intersection of the contrary tangent of 37
degrees. 30 min. with the right sine of 90 degrees. it will cut the contrary Tangent of
11 degrees. 30 min. at the right sine of 15 degrees. 22 min. and such is the side Q the
difference of ascensions required: which being converted into time gives one
hour and one minute. now for to find the time of Sunrising and setting with
the diurnal and nocturnal arches, do thus.

When the Sun has North declination add this Ascensional difference to 90 degrees
or 6 hours, so shall you have the semidiurnal arch or the time of Suns
setting, as here the ascensional difference 1 hour 1 minute added to 6 hours
makes 7 hours 1 minute, the semidiurnal arch or the time of Sun setting;
which being doubled gives 14 hours 2 minutes for the Diurnal arch; this being
taken out of 24 hours leaves 9 hours 58 minutes, for the Nocturnal arch; the
half of which 9 hours 58 minutes is 4 hours 59 minutes the time of Sun
rising, or 7 hours 1 minute, taken out of 12 hours, leaves 4 hours 59
minutes, the time of Sun rising.

But if the declination be Southwards, then take this 1 hour 1 minute the
ascensional difference, out of 6 hours and there will rest 4 hours 59
minutes, for the semidiurnal arch; which being doubled gives 9 hours 58
minutes for the length of the day; the complement unto 24 hours, is 14 hours
2 minutes the length of the night, the half of which is 7 hours 1 min. the time
of Sunrising.

CHAP. XIX. Having the latitude of the place, and the declination of the Sun,
to find the time of the beginning or ending of twilight.
THe beginning of twilight is when the Sun approaches within 18 degrees of the
Horizon in the East, and the ending of the same at 18 degrees. depression in the
West, wherefore to find the same work thus.

First, by the 16 Chap. get the height of the Sun at the hour of six, if the
declination be North; but if it be South take his depression at six, for all is
one thing, if his quantity of declination be alike, the height or depression at
six being known, if the declination be North add the sine of this height to
the sine of 18 degrees. but if the declination be south, take the difference
betwixt the sine of his depression and the sine of 18 degrees. so shall the sum of
difference be the second proportional number, then say, As the cosine of the
Latitude, To this second proportional So is the radius, To a fourth
proportional sine.
Then, As the cosine of the declination, To this fourth sine: So is the radius,
To the sine of the quantity of time between the beginning or ending of
twilight, and the hour of six.


Thus in the Diagram of the 6 Chap. having the declination of the Sun O 11 degrees.
30 min. North, and thereby the Suns height at six TO 9 degrees. 6 min. we have
given us in the Triangle byO, first, the angle ybO the complement of the
latitude 37 degrees. 30 min. and then the side O y 467 the radius being 1000, this
side is made up of the sine of the Suns height at six 158, and the sine of 18
degrees. 309, or by adding of OR 158, to R y 309, we have O y 467 for the second
proportional, these being known with the right angle at y, we may find the
base bO by the 10 Chapter or 27 Chap. of the second Book.

For if we place the thread upon the intersection of the contrary sine of 37
degrees. 30 min. with the right parallel of 467, it will cut the contrary sine of
90 degrees. at the right sine of 50 degrees. 7 min. which is the base bO. But seeing
the Radius of this sine bO, is but the cosine of the declination OH 78 degrees. 30
min. therefore I place the thread again at the intersection of the contrary
sine of 78 degrees. 30 min. with the right sine of this 50 degr. 7 min. and it will
cut the contrary sine of 90 degrees. at the right sine of 51 degrees. 33 min. and such
is the distance of time between the hour of six and the beginning or ending of
twilight, being 3 hours 26 min.

Now at all times, if you take this distance out of six hours, your remainder
shall be the beginning of twilight, and if you add this distance found unto 6
hours, the sum will be the ending of the same.

Except it be in those latitudes, where the depression of 6 is greater then 18
degrees. and then you must (in that Latitude and South declination, whose
depression at six is more then 18 degrees.) work by the contrary rule.

And when the Sun has North declination, if you take the ascensional
difference out of the distance of time between the hour of six, and the
beginning or ending of twilight, you shall have the distance of time between
Snn rising or setting, and the beginning or ending of twilight.

And when the declination is South, add the ascensional difference to the
distance of time found, and you shall have the quantity of twilight as before.

As for example, let the distance of time between the beginning or ending of
twilight and the hour of six being found to be 3 hours 26 min. if I take this
3 hours 26 min. out of 6 hours, there will remain 2 hours 34 min for the
beginning of twilight: and if I add this 3 hours 26 min. to six hours, it will
make 9 hours 26 min. for the ending of twilight.

And now being the Sun has North declination, if I take the difference of
ascensions 1 hour 1 min. (as it was found by the last Chapter,) out of 3
hours 26 min. there will remain 2 hours 25 min. for the quantity of twilight
before or after Sun rising or setting.

CHAP. XX. Having the distance of the Sun from the next Equinoctial point, to
find his right ascension.
AS the radius, To the cosine of the greatest declination: So is the Tangent of
the distance, To the Tangent of the right ascension.
Thus in the right angled Triangle X in the Diagram of the 6 Chap. having the
angle X the Suns greatest declination 23 degrees. 30 min. and the base the distance
of the Sun from the equinoctial point 30 degrees. with the right angle at X, we may
find the side X the Suns right ascension by the 33 Chap. of the second Book.

For if we place the thread at the intersection of the contrary sine of 90 degrees.
with the right tangent of 30 degrees. it will cut the contrary sine of 66 degrees
30 minutes, at the right tangent of 27 degrees 54 minutes, and so much is the
side X the right ascension required,

CHAP. XXI. Having the right ascension of the Sun or Star, together with the
difference of their Ascensions, to find the oblique Ascension and descension.
IF the declination of the Sun or Star be North, substract the ascensional
difference from the right Ascension, and the residue will be the oblique
Ascension; but if you add them together, the sum will be the oblique
descension.

But if the declination be South, add the Ascensional difference and right
ascension together, so will the sum thereof be the oblique ascension; but if
you take the Ascensional difference out of the right ascension, the remainder
will be the oblique descension.

As for Example, the right ascension of the Sun in the beginning of being found
by the last Chapter, to be 27 degrees 54 minutes and the Ascensional difference
of the same point by the 18 Chap. to be 15 degrees. 22 min. if I take 15 degrees. 22
min. out of 27 degrees. 54 min. (because the declination is North) there will
remain 12 degrees. 32 min. for the oblique ascension: likewise if I add 15 degrees. 22
min. to 27 degrees 54 minutes, the sum will be 43 degrees 16 minutes for the
oblique descension.

CHAP. XXII. Having the Azimuth, the Suns Altitude, and the declination, to
find the hour of the day.
AS the cosine of the declination, To the sine of the Azimuth: So is the cosine
of the Altitude, To the sine of the hour.
Thus in the triangle ZP in the Diagram of the 6 Chapter, having the side P the
complement of declination 78 degrees 30 min. and the side Z the complement of
the Suns Altitude 64 degrees 4 minutes with the outward angle ZP the Azimuth 74
degrees 22 min. we may find the angle ZP the hour from the meridian by the 40
Chapter of the second Book.

For if we place the thread to the intersection of the contrary sine of 78
degrees 30 minutes with the right sine of 74 degrees 22 minutes it will cut the
contrary sine of 64 degrees 4 minutes at the right sine of 62 degrees 6 minutes
and such is the angle ZP the hour from the meridian, or in time 4 hours 8
minutes which was required

CHAP. XXIII. Having the hour of the day, the Suns Altitude, and the
declination, to find the Azimuth.
AS the cosine of the Suns altitude, To the sine of the hour from the
meridian: So is the cosine of the declination, To the sine of the Azimuth.
Thus in the Triangle ZP of the diagram in the 6 Chapter having the side Z the
complement of the Suns Altitude 64 degrees 4 minutes, and the side P the
complement of declination 78 degrees 30 minutes with the angle ZP the hour
from the meridian 62 degrees 6 minutes we may find the angle PZ the Azimuth by
the 40 Chapter of the second Book.

For if we place the thread upon the intersection of the contrary sine of 64
degrees 4 minutes, with the right sine of 62 degrees 6 minutes it will cut the
contrary sine of 78 degrees 30 minutes at the right sine of 74 degrees 22
minutes and such is the outward angle PZ the Suns Azimuth from the South which
was required.

CHAP. XXIV. The Latitude of the place, the Altitude and declination of the Sun
being given, to find the hour of the day,
THus in the oblique spherical Triangle ZP in the Diagram of the 6 Chapter
having the three sides, viz. ZP the complement of the Latitude 37 degrees 30
minutes and Z the complement of the Suns Altitude 64 degrees 4 minutes with P
the complement of declination 78 degrees 30 minutes we may find the angle ZP
the hour from the meridian by the 41 Chapter of the second Book, but by this
Instrument more readily thus,

First, by the 16 Chapter, get the Suns height or depression at the hour of 6,
and if the declination be North take the distance betwixt this sine and the
sine of the Altitude given, either by substraction, or with your compasses,
this distance either count or place upon the contrary sine of the complement of
the latitude, and thereto place the thread; the thread being thus placed, will
cut the contrary sine of 90 degrees, at a right sine or parallel, which follow
to the contrary sine of the Complement of declination, and thereto place the
thread, so shall it cut the contrary sine of 90 degrees at the right sine of
the hour from six. For, As the cosine of the Latitude, To the distance betwixt
the sine of the height at six, and the sine of the Altitude given: So is the
radius, To a fourth sine.
Then, As the cosine of declination, To this fourth sine: So is the radius, To
the sine of the hour from six.


Thus in the Diagram of the 6 Chapter, having the Suns declination EG or O 11
degrees 30 minutes and the angle PB the latitude of the place 52 degrees 30
minutes, we have by the 16 Chapter the Suns height at 6 TO 9 degrees. 6 min. the
sine whereof is 158, the radius being 1000; this sine being compared with the
sine of 25 degrees. 56 min. 437 the sine of the Suns altitude R a; and taking TO
158, out of R a 437, there will remain O a 279; by which and the angle a o the
complement of the Latitude, with the right angle at a, we may find O the hour
from six.

For if we apply the thread to the intersection of the contrary sine of 37 degrees.
30 min. with the right parallel of 279, it will cut the contrary sine of 90
degrees at the right sine of about 27 degrees, but seeing this 27 degrees which
is O, is but upon the parallel of declination GO, therefore I place the thread
again at the intersection of this 27 with the contrary sine of 78 degrees. 30 min.
the complement of declination GO, and it will cut the contrary sine of 90 degrees.
at the right sine of 27 degrees. 54 min. and so much is X or the angle PX, the
hour from six, which was required.

And here note that if the Altitude given be greater then the Altitude at six,
then is the time found to the southward of six; but if it be lesser, then is it
to the northward.

But if the declination be Southward, then add the sine of his depression at
six, to the sine of the Altitude given, and with the same proceed in all
respects as before, and you shall have your desire.

All these kind of propositions upon this Instrument, when you are well
acquainted therewith, are sooner wrought then spoken.

CHAP. XXV. The Latitude of the place, the Declination and Altitude of the Sun
being given, to find the Azimuth.
THus in the obliquespherical Triang. ZP in the diagram of the 6 Chapter,
having the three sides, viz. ZP, the complement of Latitude 37 degrees 30
minutes and Z the complement of the Suns Altitude 64 degrees 4 minutes with the
side P the complement of the declination 78 degrees 30 minutes, we may find
the angle PZ by the 41 Chapter of the second Book. But we will proceed as
follows little differing from the former Chapter.

First, therefore if the Sun have North declination, get his height in the
vertical circle by the 13 or 14 Chapters, and comparing the sine thereof with
the sine of the Altitude given, take the lesser out of the greater and note the
remainder, Then say, As the cosine of the Latitude, To this remainder: So is
the sine of the Latitude, To a fourth sine.
Then, As the cosine of the Suns Altitude, To this fourth sine: So is the
radius, To the sine of the Azimuth from the East or West points, either
Northward or Southward.


For whereas when the Altitude of the Sun given, and his height in the vertical
circle is equal, he is directly in the East or West points; so when his
Altitude given is greatest, then is the Azimth toward the South; and when his
altitude given is the least, then is the azimuth toward the North.

Thus in the Diagram of the 6 Chapter, having by the 13 or 14 Chapter found the
height of the Sun in the vertical circle C 14 degrees. 33 min. the sine whereof
251, I take out of 437 the sine of 25 degrees. 56 min. W, the height of the Sun
given, and there remains CW 186; by which, and the angles WC the latitude 52
degrees. 30 min. and WC the complement of the latitude 37 degrees. 30 min. we may find
the side W by the 10th. or 25th. Chapter of the second Book.

For if we place the thread to the intersection of the contrary sine of 37 degrees.
30 min. with the right parallel or sine 186, it will cut the contrary sine of
52 degrees. 30 min. at the right sine of 14 degrees. which is the side W, but seeing
the Radius of this 14 degrees. is but the cosine of the altitude IW, therefore I
place the thread again at the intersection of the contrary sine of 64 degrees. 4
min. (the complement of the altitude) with this right sine of 14 degrees. and it
cutteth the contrary sine of 90 degrees. at the right sine of 15 degrees. 38 min. and
such is Y, or the angle ZY, the Azimuth from the East or West, and that
Southward, because the given altitude of the Sun were more then his altitude in
the vertical Circle?

But if the declination be Southward, first, get the amplitude by the ninth or
tenth Chapter, then say. As the cosine of the Latitude, To the sine of the Suns
Altitude: So is the sine of the Latitude, To a fourth sine.


Unto which fourth Sine add the Sine of the Amplitude and note the sum
thereof, then say again, As the cosine of the Altitude, To this sum last found:
So is the radius, To the sine of the Azimuth from the East or West southward.


As for example, in the Latitude of 52 degrees. 30 min. the Suns place given being
in the beginning of m, we may by the 9 Chapter find his Amplitude to be 19
degrees 7 minutes the sine whereof is 327, and let the Suns Altitude be 23
degrees 20 minutes; now placing the thread to the intersection of the contrary
Sine of 37 degrees. 30 min. with the right sine of 13 degrees. 20 min. it will cut the
contrary sine of 52 degrees. 30 minutes, at the right parallel of 301; unto which
301, put 327 the sine of the Amplitude, and the sum will be 628.

Wherefore place the thread again at the intersection of the contrary sine of
76 degrees 40 minutes, (the complement of the Suns Altitude) with the right
parallel of this sum 628, and it will cut the contrary Sine of 90 degrees. at the
right Sine of 40 degrees. 11 min. which is the Azimuth from the East or West points
Southward.

And thus have I by the fore-side of this Universal Quadrat, showed the working
of some of the most useful propositions, both for Navigation and Dialling; yet
very many more might be resolved by the same side, as the ingenuous may
perceive by considering well of that which is written in the second Book, which
of it self, is able to resolve all propositions of this nature. And now we will
proceed to show a more speedy resolution, by the moveable Planisphere on the
backside of the Quadrat.

CHAP. XXVI. The place of the Sun being given, to find his declination.
HEre you have nothing to do but only to seek the Suns place given in the
Ecliptique line, for the parallel passing thereby shows both at the limb and
also at the Axletree-line the declination required.

As for example, let the Suns place given be the beginning of, now if you seek
the beginning of on the Ecliptique line you shall find the parallel of 11
degrees 30 minutes, to pass thereby, and such is the declination required.

Thus may you speedily find the Suns declination for any day in the year his
true place being given, or the declination of any point in the Ecliptique by
the inspection of the instrument.

CHAP. XXVII. The declination of the Sun being given, to find his place in the
Ecliptique.
SEek his declination upon the Axletree-line or hour of six, and follow the
parallel thereof to the Ecliptique; so shall it there show you the place of the
Sun required.

As for example, let the declination of the Sun be 11 degrees. 30 min. which I seek
upon the Axletree-line, and finding it, I follow the parallel thereof to the
Ecliptique, and there I find it cut the beginning of, which is the Suns place
required, in regard he possesses that quarter of the Ecliptique, betwixt the
head of and. But if the Sun had been in that quarter, betwixt and, then had his
place been in the beginning of, or if it had been the quarter betwixt and, then
had his place been in the beginning of, or had he been between and, then his
place had been in the beginning of.

CHAP. XXVIII. The place of the Sun being given, to find his Right Ascension.
Seek the Suns place given in the Ecliptic, and note what Meridian Circle
passes thereby, for that Meridian followed to the Equator, shows the Right
Ascension required.

As for example: let the Suns place given be in the beginning of, the which if
you seek upon the Ecliptic, you shall findepass thereby a Meridian, which
followed to the Equator, gives 27 degrees 54 min. for the Right Ascension
which was required, counted from the beginning of.

CHAP. XXIX. Having the latitude of the place, with the place of the Sun in the
Ecliptic, to find his Amplitude.
HEre you must first place the planisphere to the latitude of the place
proposed, the which you may do, by turning the Sphere about until the North
part of the Horizon, cut the limb at the quantity of the latitude counted from
the North Pole; or rather (for readiness sake of the numbers set to the limb)
till the South end of the Horizon cut the limb at the quantity of the
Equinoctials height, counted from the said Equinoctial, which is always to the
complement of the latitude. This being done, your Instrument is ready fixed to
perform a number of Conclusions in that latitude. But now for the Amplitude,
seek the Suns place in the Ecliptic line, and look what parallel meets you
there, the same follow to the Horizon, whereon it cutteth the Amplitude counted
from the Center; showing you by the way the Declination also.

As for example, let the place of the Sun given be in the beginning of, which
point I seek in the Ecliptic, and following the parallel that passes thereby
to the Horizon, I find it there to cut 19 degrees. 7 min. counted from the Center,
and such is the Amplitude required, the Sphere being set to the latitude of 52
degrees. 30 min.

CHAP. XXX. Having the latitude of the place, with the declination of any Star,
to find his Amplitude.
FIrst, the Sphere to the latitude being set, if the star be therein placed,
follow the parallel of Declination whereon he stands to the Horizon, and if
he be not in the Instrument, get his Declination by the seventh Chap. or
otherwise by some Table for that purpose, which found, seek it in the
Axletree-line among the parallels of declination, and follow the parallel
thereof to the Horizon, and if it cutteth the Horizon, it there shows the
Amplitude; but if it cutteth it not, then does not that star set or go down
under our Horizon.

As for example, let it be required to find the Amplitude of Arcturus, I look
in my Instrument for Arcturus, and I find him placed upon the parallel of 21
d. 10 min. of North Declination, as it were just in the Horizon at 36 degrees. 23
min. from the Center, and such is his Amplitude.

And if you would have the Amplitude of the Lions Heart, look in your
Instrument and you shall find him placed upon the parallel of 13 degrees. 42 min.
of North Declination, which if you follow to the Horizon, you shall find it
there cut 22 degrees. 54 min. and such is the Amplitude of the Lions Heart, in the
latitude of 52 degrees. 30 min.

But if you would seek the Amplitude of the Bright Star, called the Harp; you
shall find him placed upon the parallel of 38 degrees. 30 min. North Declination,
but this parallel cutteth not the Horizon, therefore he goes not under our
Horizon at all, in the aforesaid latitude of 52 degrees. 30 min. but when he is in
his lowest, directly in the North, he is just one degree of height.

CHAP. XXXII. Having the Declination and Amplitude of the Sun, to find the
latitude of the place.
COunt the Declination upon the Axletree-line among the parallels of
Declination, and the Amplitude upon the Horizon from the Center, the same way
with the declination; then moving the Sphere to and fro, until the Amplitude,
and the parallel of Declination, meet both in one point; the South end of the
Horizon shall cut the Meridian, at the complement of the latitude required.

As for example, let the Suns Declination be 11 degrees. 30 min. and his amplitude
19 degrees. 7 min. if you move the Sphere until the 19th. degrees, 7 min. one the
Horizon, fall directly on the parallel of 11 degrees. 30 min. the South end of the
Horizon will cut the limb at 37 degrees. 30. min. and such is the height of the
Equinoctial, which being taken out of 90 degrees. leaves 52 degrees. 30 min. for the
latitude of the place which was required.

CHAP. XXXII. The latitude of the place, and the amplitude of the Sun being
given, to find his Declination.
FIrst, set the Sphere to the latitude proposed, then count the amplitude upon
the Horizon, and where it shall end, shall meet you a parallel; which being
followed to the Axletree-line, will there show you the Declination required.

As in the latitude of 52 degrees. 30 min. the Amplitude being 19 degrees. 7 min. if
you first place the Sphere to the latitude, and then count 19 degrees. 7 min. upon
the Horizon, there shall meet you a parallel, which being followed to the
Axle-tree line, shall there give you 11 degrees. 30 min. the Declination required.

CHAP. XXXIII. Having the latitude of the place, and the Declination of the
Sun, to find his height in the vertical Circle.
FIrst, set the Sphere to the latitude given, then count the Declination given
among the Almicanters from both ends of the Horizon toward the Zenith, and
thereto place the thread parallel to the Horizon, and where the thread so
placed cutteth the Axletree-line, or six a clock hour-line, there is the
altitude required.

As in the latitude of 52 degrees. 30 min. the Declination of the Sun being 11 degrees.
30 min. if you count this 11. degrees. 30 min. from both ends of the Horizon among
the Almicanters, and place the thread thereto, it shall lie parallel to the
Horizon, and cut the Axle-tree-line at 14 degrees. 33 min. and such is the Suns
height, when he is directly in the East or West points which was required.

Or if you place the Horizon to 52 degrees. 30 min. in the limb counted from the
Equator, and count the Declination upon the Axletree-line, viz. 11 degrees. 30 min.
the parallel thereof shall cut the Horizon at 14 degrees. 33 min. for the height of
the Sun in the vertical Circle, the same as before.

CHAP. XXXIV. Having the latitude of the place, and the Declination of the Sun,
to find the time of his coming to the East or West Points.
FIrst, set the Planisphere, to the latitude given, then place the thread upon
the Zenith and the Nadir, so shall it cut the Horizon at right angles in the
Center, and the parallel of Declination at the time from six, counted among the
Meridians.

As for example, let the latitude given be 52 degrees. 30 min. and the Suns
Declination 11 degrees. 30 min. First, place the Horizon to 37 degrees. 30 min. the
complement of the latitude below the South end of the Equator, then place the
thread to the Zenith and Nadir, that is to 52 degrees. 30 min. above the South end
of the Equator, and as much below the North end thereof; the thread being
sixed, shall cut the Horizon at right angles in the Center, and also the
parallel of 11 degrees. 30 min at the Meridian of 9 degrees. or in time, at 36 minutes
from the hour of six, and such is the distance of time betwixt the hour of six,
and the Suns coming to the East or West points, which was required.

CHAP. XXXV. Having the latitude of the place, and the Declination of the Sun,
to find his height at the hour of six.
FIrst, set the Horizon to the complement of the latititude below the South end
of the Equator, or the Equator to the complement of the latitude above the
South end of the Horizon which is all one; then seek the Declination upon the
Axletree-line, and place the thread thereunto parallel to the Horizon, by help
of the Almicanters at both ends thereof; so shall the thread show among those
Almicanters, the height of the Sun required.

Thus in the latitude of 52 degrees. 30 min. the Suns declination being 11 degrees. 30
min. I first set the Equator 37 degrees. 30 min. above the Horizon, and then place
the thread to 11 degrees. 30 min. counted in the Axletree-line, and moving the ends
thereof to and fro until the thread lie parallel to the Horizon, which will be
when both ends of the thread cut like degrees from the Horizon upon the
Almicanters; the thread being thus placed upon the 11 degrees. 30 min. in the
Axletree-line, and parallel to the Horizon, will cut at each end thereof 9 degrees.
6 min. among the Almicanters, and such is the height of the Sun at the hour of
six.

Or if you place the Equator 52 degrees. 30 min. above the South end of the
Horizon, and then count 11 degrees. 30 min. upon the Horizon, where you shall find
meet you a parallel, which being followed to the Axletree-line, shall there
give you 9 degrees. 6 min. for the altitude of the Sun at six as before.

CHAP. XXXVI. Having the latitude of the place, and the Declination of the Sun,
to find his Azimuth at the hour of six.
FIrst, set the Sphere according to the latitude given, and count the
Declination upon the horizon, and look what parallel there meets you, the
same follow to the Axtree-line, where it will show you the Azimuth desired.

As in the latitude of 52 degrees. 30 min. the declination of the Sun being 11 degrees.
30 min. First, I place the Equator at 37 degrees. 30 min. above the South end of
the horizon, and count the Declination 11 degrees. 30 min upon the horizon, where I
find to meet me the parallel of 7 degrees. 4 min. and such is the Azimuth from the
East or West points Northwards.

CHAP. XXXVII. Having the latitude of the place, and the Declination of the
Sun, to find the Ascensional difference, and consequently the time of
Sunrising and setting, with the Diurnal and Nocturnal arches.
FIrst, set the Planisphere to the latitude given, and reckoning the
declination upon the Axletree-line, follow low the parallel thereof to the
Horizon, where you shall find meet you the meridian of the ascensional
difference, counted from the hour of six: and this same meridian gives you
the time of Sun setting counted from the South part of the limb or general
meridian, and likewise the time of his rising counted from the North part of
the limb: and now if you still note this intersection of the Horizon and Suns
parallel, and count the hours thereupon between the South part of the limb
and the Horizon, you shall have the Suns semidiurnal arch, and from the Horizon
to the North part of the limb his seminocturnal arch, both which being
doubled, gives you both the diurnal and nocturnal arches.

As for example, let the latitude given be 52 degrees 30 minutes, and the
declination 11 degrees 30 minutes first, I set the Equator 37 degrees 30
minutes, above the Horizon, then counting 11 degrees 30 minutes upon the
Axtree-line, I follow the parallel thereof to the Horizon, where I find meet
me the meridian of 15 degrees. 22 min. and such is the difference of Ascensionals
required.

Now upon the same parallel of declination, I seek how many hours I can find
betweeene the South part of the limb and the Horizon, which is 7 hours 1
minute and so much is the semidiurnal arch, and the time of Sun setting; which
being doubled makes 14 hours 2 minutes, the diurnal arch; so likewise
counting the hours between the North part of the limb and the horizon, I
find them 4 hours 59 minutes and such is the seminocturnal arch, and the time
of sunrising; which being doubled gives 9 hours 58 min. for the Nocturnal
arch, the semidiurual and seminocturnal arches, of any Star, whose declination
is known, may be found in the self same manner.

CHAP. XXXVIII. Having the latitude of the place, and the declination of the
Sun, to find the time of the beginning and ending of twilight.
FIrst, set the sphere to the latitude given, then count the declination upon
the axtree-line either Northward or Southward according as it is, and then
place the thread (parallel to the Horizon) to the 18 degrees. of depression below
the same, and note where it cutteth the parallel of declination, for those
hours to the Southward of the thread gives the time of twilight ending; and
the other to the Northward the time of its beginning.

As for example, let the latitude given be 52 degrees 30 minutes, and the
declination of the Sun 11 degrees. 30 min. first, I set the Equator 37 degrees. 30 min.
above the horizon, and counting 11 degrees. 30 min. upon the axletree-line
Northward, (because his declination is toward that pole;) I place the thread
parallel to the horizon 18 degrees. below the same, and I find it cut the said
parallel of 11 degrees. 30 min. at 2 hours 34 minutes, from the North part of the
limb, and such is the time of the beginning of twilight; so does it likewise
cut the same parallel at 9 hours 26 minutes from the South part of the
meridian, and such is the time of the ending of twilight, which was required.

CHAP. XXXIX. The latitude of the place, the altitude and declination of the
Sun being given, to find the hour of the day.
FIrst, place the planisphere to the latitude given, and seek his declination
on the axletree-line among the parallels of Declination, then place the thread
(parallel to the horizon) to the degree of the Suns altitude counted from the
horizon among the Almicanters, and where the thread so placed shall cut the
parallel of Declination, there passes by the Meridian which gives you the
hour of the day.

As for example, in the latitude of 52 degrees. 30 min. the Declination of the Sun
being 11 degrees. 30 min. and his altitude 25 degrees. 56 min. I set the Equator 37
degrees. 30 min. above the horizon, and count 11 degrees. 30 min. upon the
Axletree-line; then placing the thread to 25 degrees. 56 min. among the
Almicanters, I find it cut the parallel of 11 degrees. 30 min. at four hours 8
minutes from the Meridian, and so much was the hour of the day if the
observation was made in the afternoon, but if the observation was made before
noon, then was it 7 a clock, and 52 min. in the forenoon.

Again, let the latitude and declination be the same, as before, and the
altitude given 42 degrees. 26 min. now if I place the thread to 42 degrees. 26 min.
among the Almicanters, it will cut the parallel of 11 degrees. 30 min. at just two
hours from the Meridian, so shall it be either ten a clock in the morning, or
two afternoon, according to the observation.

CHAP. XL. The latitude of the place, the Suns altitude and Declination being
given, to find his Azimuth.
FIrst, set the Sphere to the latitude given, and then count your altitude
among the parallels of Declination, and your Declination among the Almicanters,
so shall your Meridians become Azimuths, and the work will be the same as in
the former Chapter. Only here by the way, I would have you note, that as your
parallels and Almicanters changed offices, so must your North and South part of
the general Meridian change names, so that when your thread cutteth any
parallel at any Azimuth, if you count that Azimuth from the South part of the
limb, it shall be the Azimuth from the North; and if you count it from the
North part of the limb, it shall be the Azimuth from the South.

And here also note, that your altitude given must be always counted among the
parallels of North Declination; and when the Declination is South, the thread
must lie below the horizon, and when the declination is North, it must lie
above the same.

As for example, in the latitude of 52 degrees. 30 min. let the Declination of the
Sun be 11 degrees. 30 min. and his altitude 25 degrees. 56 min. First, I set the
Equator 37 degrees. 30 min. above the South end of the horizon, and count 25 degrees.
56 min. among the parallels of Declination, then I place the thread to 11 degrees.
30 min. above the horizon, because the Declination is North, and I find it cut
the parallel of 25 degrees. 56 min. at the Azimuth of 74 degrees. 22 minutes, counted
from the North part of the limb, and such is the Azimuth from the South, and
if you count the Azimuths from the South part of the limb, you shall find the
thread cut the Azimuth of 105 degrees. 38 min. which is the Azimuth from the North.

Again, let the latitude and the declination be the same as before, and the
altitude of the Sun 30 degrees. 45 min. now the thread being placed to 11 degrees. 30
min. counted among the Almicanters above the Horizon, will cut the parallel of
30 degrees. 45 min. at the Azimuth of 66 degrees. 30 min. counted from the North part
of the limb, and such is the Azimuth from the South.

A third example, let the latitude be the same, and the Suns declination 11
degrees. 30 min. South, and his Altitude 13 degrees. 20 min. now if you place the
thread 11 degrees. 30 min. below the Horizon, it will cut the parallel of 13 degrees.
20 min. at the Azimuth of 49 degrees. 49 min. counted from the North part of the
limb, and such is the Azimuth from the south, as was required.

CHAP. XLI. The longitude and latitude of any planet or fixed star being given,
to sinde his Declination and right Ascension.
FIrst, seek the stars latitude among the parallels of latitude, and upon the
parallel of latitude count his longitude, and where this count ends, there is
the true place of the Star, both in respect of longitude and latitude, this
point being found, look what parallel of declination passes thereby, for that
is the declination of the Star from the Equinoctial; and also look what
meridian meets you there, for that is the right ascension of the star
counted from the equinoctial point Aries.

As for example, let the declination and right ascension of the bright Star
Arcturus be required, whose latitude from the ecliptique is 31 degrees North,
and longitude in the 19 degrees 22 minutes, now looking the 19 degrees 22
minutes upon the parallel of 31 degrees, North latitude, I find there to meet
me the parallel of 21 degrees. 10 min. North declination, and also the meridian of
just 14 hours of time from the equinoctial point Aries, and such is the
declination and right ascension of Arcturus, which was required.

CHAP. XLII. Having the declination and right ascension of any fixed Star, to
find his longitude and latitude.
FIrst, seek the Stars declination among the parallels of declination, upon
which count his right ascension, and where this count ends, shall meet you
both the circle of his longitude, and the parallel of his latitude.

As for example, let the longitude and latitude of Acturus be required, whose
declination is 21 degrees 10 North, and right ascension 14 hours now upon the
parallel of 21 degrees 10 minutes North declination, I count 14 hours from the
equinoctial point Aries, and there I find to meet me the parallel of 31
degrees North latitude, and also the circle of longitude for 19 degrees 22
minutes, and such is the longitude and latitude of Arcturus, which was required.

CHAP. XLIII. To find the culmination, or southing, of any of the fixed Stars,
as also of the Moon and other Planets. First, for the fixed Stars.
IF it be a Star which is placed in your Instrument, his culmination is
speedily to be found after this manner, at the estimate time of the Stars
culmination, seck the Suns place in some Ephemeris; then seek the Star whose
culmination you desire in the outward Ecliptic which encompasseth the
Planisphere, and bring the South point of the hour Circle (which is the point
where the hours both begin and end, at 24, for I count the hours from the noon
of the one day, to 24 at the noon of the day following) directly to the Star;
so shall the place of the Sun in the same Ecliptic, point out the time of
culmination upon the hour circle.

As for example, upon the 20th. of September 1652, it is required to find the
time of the 7 Stars coming to the South, which I guess will be about two a
clock in the morning, at which time the Sun is about 7 degrees. 20 min., now
finding the 7 Stars in the instrument, I move about the hour circle, until the
South point thereof, or 24 hours stand directly against the 7 Stars, and then
looking for 7 degrees. 20 min., I find it stand directly against 15 hours in the
hour circle, wherefore I conclude, that the 7 Stars comes to the South that
morning at three of the clock.

Again, upon the 20th. of December, I would know the time of the 7 Stars
culmination, which I suppose may be about 8 at night; at which time I find the
Sun in 10 degrees., now the South point of the hour-circle being set against the 7
Stars as before, I find 10 degrees. of to stand against 8 hours 45 min. in the
hour-circle, whereby it does appear, that the 7 Stars comes to the South that
afternoon at 8 of the clock, and 45 minutes.

But if you would have the culmination, of any of the Planets, or of any other
Star not placed in your instrument, you must first get their right Ascension by
the 41 Chap. which being found, follow the circle thereof to the ecliptique
line, and it will there show you the sine and degree whereunto you must set the
South point of the hour circle, which being done; the place of the Sun will
point out the hour required.

As for example, let it be required to find the time of the Moons coming to
the South upon the 30 of December 1652, which I suppose may be about 8 of the
clock at night; at which time I find the Moon in 1 degrees. 47 min., with latitude
4 degrees. 36 min. North, and so by the 41 Chapter her right Ascension is 58 degrees 40
min. which circle of 58 degrees. 40 min. right ascension, I follow to the
ecliptique line, and there I find it cut 00 degrees. 50 min., therefore I set the
South point of the hour circle; to 00 degrees. 50 min., and then looking for the
Suns place, (which at the estimate time was in 20 degrees. 12 min.) I find it to
stand against 8 hours 30 min. wherefore I conclude that the Moon comes to the
South that night at 8 of the clock and 30 min.

CHAP. XLIV. To find the time of the rising or setting, of any of the fixed
Stars, and also of the moon or other planets.
WHen you would find the time of any Stars rising, first get his seminocturnal
arch according to the 37 Chap. which put unto 12 hours, and if the Star be
placed in the Instrument, bring that number of hours to the Star; but if the
Star be not in the Instrument, find his place by the last Chap. and bring this
Sum of 12 hours and the Stars seminocturnal arch thereto, so shall the place
of the Sun point out the the time of his rising.

As for example, the 30 of December 1652, let the rising of Arcturus be
required, which I suppose may be about 10 of the clock in the night, at which
time the Sun is in 20 degrees. 22 min. of, first, by the 37 Chap. I find his
seminocturnal arch to be 4 hours 3 min. which put unto 12 hours makes 16 hours
3 min. and in regard Arcturus is placed in the Instrument, I bring 16 hours 3
minunto him, so shall the Sun in 20 degrees. 22 min., point-out 10 hours for the
time of Arcturus rising the said 30 of December in the night.

And if you would have the time of his setting, bring unto him his semidiurnal
arch, which you may find to be 7 hours 59 min. so shall the Sun in 19 degrees. 56
min., (which is his place of the estimate time of the Stars setting) point to 2
hours 32 min. in the hour circle, for the time of Arcturus setting afternoon,
in the day and year aforesaid.

And thus may you find the time of any other Star, or Planets rising or
setting, if you first get his declination by the 41 Chap. and then his
semidiurnal and seminocturnal arches by the 37 Chap. and then by the last Chap.
find the place whereunto you must bring his semidiurnal or seminocturnal arch,
as you there did the South point for his culmination, so shall the Suns place
at the estimate time, point out the time required.

CHAP. XLV. To find the exact hour of the night speedily by the Stars.
FIrst, with your instrument observe the Stars horary distance from the
meridian, that is, first take his height, and then find his hour from the
meridian, as you did for the Sun in the 39 Chap. in all respects. but here I
would have you note, that in taking the height of a Star by the common sights,
the holes are so small that you cannot perceive a Star through them; and
therefore for this purpose you may have two great sight holes for the Stars,
and two lesser ones for the Sun, or rather as I use to make them for my self
and my friends in all my night dials, which is thus: in the sight next my eye I
make a great hole, and for the sight by the center, I set up a flat pin of
brass perpendicular to the plate, the breadth of this pin would be such, that
the shadow thereof may not fully fill the hole of the other sight, so that when
the Sun shines, and the shadow of the pin fall upon the hole of the other
sight, there may some small light of the Sun pass through the hole, on both
sides of the shadow: by which means you may take the height of the Sun as
exactly as by fine holes; and you may take the height of a Star better with
this pin, then with great sight holes. But now to the matter in hand, the
horary distance of the Star from the meridian being found, seek it in the
hour circle, if the Star be to the Westward of the Meridian; but if the Star
be to the Eastward, take the complement of his horary distance to 24 hours and
seek that in the hour circle; which being found, bring it to the Star or to
his place found as in 43 Chap. so shall the place of the Sun point out the
hour required.

As for example, upon the 16 of November 1652, it being serene air, I desired
to see what time of the morning it were; for which purpose I made use of
Arcturus, and by observation I sound his height to be 27 degrees. 12 min. toward
the East; now his declination being 21 degrees. 10 min. North, I find by the 39
Chap. that he was 4 hours 50 min. from the South, and in regard he is on the
East side of the meridian I take the complement of 4 hours 50 min. to 24 hours,
which is 19 hours 10 min. this 19 hours 10 min. I seek in the hour circle and
bring it to Arcturus; now the Sun at the estimate timebeing in 4 degrees. 40 min.,
points to 17 hours in the hour circle, which is directly 5 of the clock in
the morning, the like may be done by any of the planets, as I will make appear
by these two examples following, which I made in the day time by the glittering
planet Venus.

The 16 of November 1652, I made these two following observations by the planet
Venus in the day time, as to the finding of the hour by the Stars, she being
about her greatest distance from the Sun.
The said 16 day being serene, and I being abroad, and in a convenient place
where I might see a clear Horizon, and seeing Venus shining so bright directly
at the Suns rising, I could do no less then make observation by her, to see
how her longitude, latitude, right ascension, declination and likewise the
hour found by her would agree with the time of Sun rising wherefore first, I
observed her altitude by my Instrument which being but small I could not make
so exact observation as otherwise Imight have done; but as it were I found her
altitude just 30 degrees. Now the estimate time being Sun rising, (which was that
morning at 8 a clock and 1 min. in our latitude of 52 degrees. 30 min.) I looked in
my Almanac for the longitude and latitude of, which I found according to Mr.
Vincent Wings Ephemeris, to be in 18 degrees., with 2 degrees. North latitude; then by
the 41 Chap. I find her declination to be 5 degrees. 14 min. South, and so by the
39 Chap. her hour from the meridian to be no more but 57 min. so likewise by
the 41 Chap. I find her right Ascension to be 13 hours 9 min. which circle I
follow to the Ecliptique line, where it gives me 18 degrees. 45 min., for the
place of in the outward ecliptique; unto which 18 degrees. 45 min., I bring the
complement of 0 hours 57 min. which is 23 hours 3 min. so does the Sun in 4
degrees. 47 min. being his place at the time of his rising, point out 20 hours 1
min. for the time required, agreeing exactly with the time of Sun rising: being
also a good proof, that was then in the aforesaid place, both in respect of
longitude and latitude.

A second example, the same day a while after noon I observed the altitude of
again, which I found to be 16 degrees. 56 min. the Sun being then in 5 degrees, and in
18 degrees. 10 min., which 2 degrees. North latitude, wherefore by the 41 Chap. I found
her declination to be 5 degrees. 18 min. South, and so by the 39 Chap. her distance
from the meridian 3 hours 32 min. so likewise by the said 41 Chap. her right
ascension was 13 hours 10 min. which circle of right ascension I follow to the
ecliptique line, where it gives me the 19th degrees. of for the place of in the
outward ecliptique; unto which 19 degrees., I bring 3 hours 32 min. of the hour
circle, so did the Sun in 5 degrees., point to 0 hours 30 min. in the hour
circle; whereby it does appear, that it was then half an hour past 12 of the
clock in the day time; and in deed so it was by my fixed Sun Dial, being an
exact Dial of a yeard square. perhaps some will think it strange, that the
hour of the day should be found by this Star, or that this Star should appear
so bright at the noon time of the day, that the hour should thereby be found,
there being no Eclips of the Sun at that time; but indeed it is not so strange
as its true, as some of my friends can testify.

Thus having showed on both sides of the Universal Quadrat, how to resolve such
Propositions Astronomical, as are most useful for Seamen and Diallers and such
like Artists; I will now show likewise how to resolve such Nautical
propositions, as are of ordinary use, concerning longitude. latitude rumb, and
distance.

CHAP. XLVI. To find how many minutes or miles, answer to one degree of
longitude, in any latitude required.
IN sailing by the compass, the course holds sometime upon a great circle,
sometime upon a parallel to the Equator; but most commonly upon crooked lines
winding toward one of the Poles, which lines are well known by the name of
Rombs.

If the course hold upon a great circle, it is either North or South, under
some one of the meridians, or else East or West under the Equator: and in these
cases, every degree requires an allowance of 20 leagues or 60 miles, every 20
leagues making a degree difference in sailing upon those circles; so that here
needs no further precept then this, divide your leagues sailed by 20, and you
shall have the degrees of distance; and contrarily, multiply the degrees of
distance by 20, so shall you have the number of leagues sailed.

But if the course hold East or West, upon any of the parallels to the Equator,
to find how many miles do answer to one degree of the Equinoctial take this
proportion. As the radius, To the cosine of the latitude: So is 60 miles the
measure of one degree at the equator, To the number of miles answering to one
degree of longitude in the given latitude.


Thus in the latitude of 50 degrees. if I place the thread upon the intersection of
the contrary sine of 90 degrees. with the right sine of 40 degrees. (which is the
complement to 50 degrees.) it will cut the contrary parallel of 60, at the right
parallel of 38 34/60, and so many miles do answer to one degree of longitude,
in the latitude of 50 degrees.

Again, in the latitude of 52 degrees. 30 min. I place the thread to the
intersection of the contrary sine of 90 degrees. with the right sine of 37 degrees. 30
min. and it cutteth the contrary parallel of 60, at the right parallel of 36
31/60, and so many miles do answer to one degree of longitude, in the latitude
of 52 degrees 30 min. as was required.

Or if you place the bead to 60 on the side of the quadrat, and then open the
thread to the angle of the latitude, as here to 50 degrees. the bead will cut the
contrary parallel of 38 34/60, as in the first example.

And if you open the thread to the angle of 52 degrees 30 min. the bead will cut
the contrary parallel of 36 31/60, as in the latter example.

CHAP. XLVII. To find what difference of longitude be longs to one degree or
20 leagues of distance, upon any parallel of latitude.
AS the cosine of the latitude, To the sine of 90 degrees. So is the distance
of 20 leagues on the parallel, To the difference of longitude required.
Thus in the latitude of 50 degrees. if you place the thread to the intersection of
the contrary sine of 40 degrees. with the right sine of 90 degrees. it will cut the
contrary parallel of 20 leagues, at the right parallel of 31 leagues and
something better, or 1 degrees. 33 min. and such is the difference of longitude at
the Equator, answering to 20 leagues of distance on the parallel of 50 degrees. of
latitude.

Again in the latitude of 52 degrees. 30 min. if you place the thread to the
intersection of the contrary sine of the complement of the latitude 37 degrees. 30
min. with the right sine of 90 degrees. it will cut the contrary parallel of 20
leagues, at the right parallel of almost 33 leagues, or 1 degrees. 39 min. and such
is the difference of longitude, answering to 20 leagues of distance in the
parallel of 52 degrees 30 min.

CHAP. XLVIII. To find how many leagues do answer to one degree of latitude,
upon any Romb required.
AS the Cosine of the Romb from the Meridian, To 20 leagues, or one degree upon
the Meridian: So is the Radius, To the leagues answering to one degree upon the
Romb.
Sailing from the North parallel of 40 degrees upon a course Northeast and by
East, which is the fifth Romb from the Meridian, or 56 degrees. 15 min. the
complement whereof is 33 degrees. 45 min. it is required how many leagues the ship
should run, before it should raise the Pole one degree.

Wherefore I place the thread at the intersection of the contrary sine of 33
degrees: 45 min: with the right sine of 90 degrees: and it will cut the contrary
parallel of 20 leagues, at at the right parallel of 36 leagues; and so much way
must the Ship make upon the fifth Rumb from the Meridian, before she can raise
or lay the Pole one degree.

CHAP. XLIX. To find how much any ship has raised or depressed the Pole,
knowing the course she has made, and the leagues she has sailed.
AS the sine of 90 degrees, To the cosine of the Rumb from the Meridian. So is
the distance upon the Rumb, To the difference between both latitudes.
Thus knowing the course to be on the fifth Rumb or 56 degr. 15 min. from the
Meridian, the complement whereof is 33 degrees. 45 min. and the leagues sailed 120,
we may find the difference of latitude.

For if we place the thread upon the intersection of the contrary sine of 90
degrees. with the right sine of 33 degrees. 45 min: it will cut the contrary parallel
of 120, at the right parallel of 66 leagues, or 3 degrees. 20 min. and so much have
you altered your latitude.

Or if you lay the thread upon the side of the quadrat and apply the bead to
the leagues sailed which is 120, and then open the thread to the angle of the
Rumb, which here is the fifth, or 56 degrees 15 min. from the Meridian, so will the
bead cut the contrary parallel of 66 leagues and 2 miles, or 3 degrees. 20 min. as
before, which is the difference of latitude here required.

CHAP. L. By the Rumb and both latitudes to find the distance upon the Rumb.
AS the cosine of the Rumb from the Meridian, To the sine of 90 degrees. So the
difference between both latitudes, To the distance upon the rumb.
Let the Latitude of the first place be 50 degrees. and the latitude of the second
53 degrees 20 min. and the Rumb the fifth from the Meridian, the complement whereof
is 33 degrees. 45 min. then taking the lesser latitude out of the greater, there
will remain 3 degrees. 20 min. or 66 leagues 2 miles; now for to find the distance
upon the Rumb or the leagues the Ship has sailed, place the thread to the
intersection of the contrary sine of 33 degrees. 45 min. with the right sine of 90
degrees. and it will cut the contrary parallel of 66 leagues 2 miles, at the right
parallel of 120 leagues.

Or if you place the thread to the angle of the fifth Rumb from the Meridian 56
degrees. 15 min. and to the intersection of the thread with the contrary parallel
of 66 leagues place the bead, then moving the thread to the side of the
quadrat, the bead will there give you 120 for the leagues sailed as before.

CHAP. LI. By the distance and both latitudes, to find the rumb.
AS the distance on the rumb, To the difference between both latitudes: So is
the sine of 90 degrees, To the cosine of the Rumb from the Meridian.
Thus the one place being in 50 degrees. of latitude, and the other in the latitude
of 53 degrees. 20 min. the difference of latitude will be 3 degrees. 20 min. or 66
leagues, and the distance between them being 120 leagues, we may find the
Rumb.

For if we place the thread to the intersection of the contrary parallel of
120, with the right parallel of 66; it will cut the contrary sine of 90 degrees. at
the right sine of 33 degrees. 45 min. the complement whereof being 56 degrees. 15 min.
is the inclination of the Rumb to the Meridian as was required. And if you
allow 11 degrees. 15 min. to each Rumb, you shall find it to be the fifth from the
Meridian.

Or if you place the bead to 120, and then open the thread until the bead cut
the contrary porallel of 66 so shall the thread cut in the quadrant 56 degrees. 15
min. for the inclination of the Rumb to the Meridian as before.

CHAP. LII. By the Rumb and difference of latitudes, to find the difference of
longitude.
AS the cosine of the Rumb from the Meridian, To the difference of latitudes:
So is the sine of the Rumb from the Meridian, To the difference of longitude in
the commor Sea-chart.
Then, As the cosine of the middle latitude, Is to the radius: So is the
difference of longitude in the common Sea-chard. To the difference of longitude
required.


Thus sailing upon the third rumb or 33 degrees. 45 min. from the Meridian, from
the North parallel of 50 degrees. until the Pole was raised 4 degrees. 10 min. the
difference of longitude is desired.

First, therefore place the thread to the angle of 33 degrees. 45 min. and it will
cut the contrary parallel of 4 degrees. 10 min. which is 83 leagues, at the right
parallel of 55 leagues, which makes 2 degrees 47 minutes, and such is the
difference of longitude according to the common Sea-card, the which the
foreside of this quadrat does lively represent. But this difference of
longitude so found, is always lesser then it should be, and therefore to be
enlarged after this manner; put one half of the difference of latitude, to the
lesser latitude, or take it out of the greater, so shall the sum or difference
be the middle latitude.

As here the difference of latitude being 4 degrees 10 min: the half thereof 2
degrees: 55 min: put to 50 degrees: makes 52 degrees: 5 min: for the middle latitude, the
complement whereof is 37 degrees. 55 min:

Wherefore if you place the thread to the intersection of the contrary sine of
37 degrees: 55 min: with the right sine of 90 degrees: it will cut the contrary
parallel of 55, at the right parallel of 90 leagues, or 4 degrees: 31 min: and such
is the difference of longitude required:

CHAP. LIII. By the distance of latitude and leagues sailed, to find the
difference of longitude.
SAiling 100 leagues between the North and the East, from the North parallel
of 50 degrees: until the Pole be raised 4 degrees: 10 min: the difference of longitude
is required:

First place the bead to 100 leagues on the side of the quadrant, then open the
thread til the bead cutteth the contrary parallel of the difference of
latitudes 4 degrees: 10 min: or 83 leagues, so shall the thread cut in the
quadrant, the degrees of the Rumb from the Meridian, which is 33 degrees: 45 min:
and the bead shall cut the right parallel of 55 leagues, which is the
difference of meridians according to the common Sea-card: now this difference
being always too little, I place the thread again to the intersection of the
contrary sine of the complement of the middle latitude 52 degrees: 5 min: that is
to the contrary sine of 37 degrees: 55 min: with the right sine of 90 degrees: and it
will cut the contrary parallel of 55 leagues, at the right parallel of 90
leagues, or 4 degrees: 31 min: and such is the difference of longitude required:

CHAP. LIVE. By the difference of latitude, and difference of longitude, to
find the Rumb leading from the one to the other.
AS the sine of 90 degrees, To the difference of Meridians: So the cosine of the
middle latitude, To the difference of longitude in the common Sea-card.
Then, As the difference of latitudes, To the difference of longitude in the
common Sea-card So is the Tangent of 45 degrees, To the Tangent of the Rumb
from the meridian.


Sailing from the North parallel of 50 degrees. betwixt the North and the East,
until the Pole be raised 4 degrees. 10 min. and altered the Meridian 4 degrees. 31 min.

Now the course the ship has run from the first place to the second, is
demanded.

First, turn the degrees of difference into leagues, so shall you have 83
leagues for the difference of latitude, and 90 leagues for the difference of
longitude.

Now placing the thread to the intersection of the contrary sine of 90 degrees.
with the right parallel of 90 leagues it will cut the contrary sine of 37 degrees.
55 min. the complement of the middle latitude, at the right parallel of 55
leagues, and such is the difference of longitude in the common Sea-card.

Then again I place the thread to the intersection of the contrary parallel of
83 leagues, with the right parallel of 55 leagues; and it will cut the contrary
tangent of 45 degrees. at the right tangent of 33 degrees. 45 min. and such is the
inclination of the rumb to the Meridian which was required.

Or if you place the bead to 90 leagues on the side of the quadrat, and then
open the thread to the angle of 37 degrees. 55 min. the bead will cut the right
parallel of 55 leagues; now where this parallel cutteth the contrary parallel
of 83 leagues, there place the thread; so shall it give in the quadrant 33 degrees.
45 min: for the inclination of the rumbe to the Meridian, as before, whereby it
does appear that the Ships course was Northeast and by North the thing
required.

CHAP. LV. By one latitude, Rumb, and distance, to find the difference of
latitude, and also of longitude.
AS the sine of 90 degrees, To the cosine of the Rumb from the Meridian: So is
the distance on the Rumb, To the difference of latitudes.
Then, As the cosine of the Rumb from the Meridian, To the difference of
latitudes: So is the sine of the Rumb from the Meridian, To the difference of
longitude in the common Sea-card.
Then again, As the cosine of the middle latitude, Is to the radius: So is the
difference of longitude in the common Sea-card, To the difference of longitude
required.


Sailing from the North parallel of 50 degrees. 100 leagues, upon the course
Northeast and by North, the difference of latitude, and also of longitude is
required.

First, by the first proportion according to the 49 Chap. you shall find the
difference of latitudes to be 83 leagues, or 4 degrees: 10 min: and then by the two
latter proportions according to the 52 Chapter, you shall find the difference
of longitude to be 90 leagues, or 4 degrees: 31 min. as was required.

Or more speedily thus, place the bead to 100 leagues on the side of the
quadrat, and then open the thread to 33 degrees: 45 min: the Rumb from the
Merician, so shall the bead cut the contrary parallel of 83 leagues, or 4 degrees:
10 min: and such is the difference of latitude required

The thread lying still in this position, the bead shall likewise cut the right
parallel of 55 leagues, for the difference of longitude according to the common
Sea-card: now where this right parallel of 55 leagues, intersecteth the
contrary sine of 37 degrees: 55 min: (which is the complement of the middle) there
place the thread again, so shall it cut the contrary sine of 90 degrees. at the
right parallel of 90 leagues, or 4 degrees. 31 min. as before.

CHAP. LVI. By the longitude and latitude of two places, to find their
distance upon the Rumb.
FIrst, place the thread to the intersection of the contrary sine of 90 degrees.
with the right sine of the complement of the middle latitude; and it shall cut
the contrary parallel of the difference of longitude, at the right parallel of
of the difference of longitude in the common Sea-card: then at the intersection
of this last right parallel, with the contrary parallel of the difference of
latitudes, there place the Bead; which being applied to the side of the Quadrat
shall give you the distance upon the Rumb as was required.

Let two Cities be given, one in the latitude of 50 degrees. and the other in the
latitude of 54 degrees. 10 min. and let the difference of longitude be 4 degrees. 31
min. now to find their distance, first turn their difference of longitude, and
also of latitude into leagues, so will their difference of longitude be 90
leagues, and their difference of latitude 83 leagues; now if you place the
thread to the intersection of the contrary sine of 90 degrees. with the right sine
of 37 degrees. 55 min. (which is the complement of the middle latitude,) it will
cut the contrary parallel of 90 leagues, at the right parallel of 55 leagues,
for the difference of longitude in the common Sea-card: now where this right
parallel of 55 leagues, cutteth the contrary parallel of 83 leagues there place
the bead, which being applied to the side of the Quadrat, gives 100 leagues
for the distance of the two Cities which was required.

And if you mind this last position of the theed, you shall see it cut in the
Quadrant, 33 degrees. 45 min. for the Rumb from the Meridian, which leads from
the one to the other, which is more then was required.

CHAP. LVII. By the way of the Ship, and two angles of position, to find the
distance between the ship and the land.
SUppose being at A, I had sight of some land at B, the Ship going from A
toward C; and observing the first angle of the Ships position BAC, I find it
to be 18 degrees. 26 min. and when the Ship had made 3 leagues or 10 miles of way
from A unto D, I observed again, and I found the second angle of the ships
position BDC to be 36 degrees. 52 min. now may I find the third angle ABD to be 18
degrees. 26 min. either by substraction, or by complement unto 180 degrees, diagram
of the measurement of distance

In this and the like cases, I have a righ tlined triangle, in which there is
one side with the three angles known, and it is required to find the other two
sides, the which you may do by this proportion. As the sine of the angle
opposite to the known side, Is to that known side: So is the sine of the angle
opposite to the side required, To the side required.
Wherefore I place the thread to the intersection of the contrary sine of 18
degrees. 26 min. with the right parallel of 10; and it will cut the contrary sine
of 36 degrees: 52 min. at the right parallel of very near 19; and such is the
distance AB, which is the distance between the place of your first observation
at A, and the land at B. The thread lying in the same position, does likewise
cut the contrary sine of 18 degrees: 26 min: the angle BAC, at the right parallel
of 10; and such is the distance from the place of the second observation at D,
unto the land at B, which is equal to the Ships way AD, because the angles at A
and B happened to be equal.

CHAP. LVIII. To find the distance of any Ship from you, your self standing
upon some high clift or platform by the Sea coast, the height of the said
platform above the water being known.
TO perform this conclusion and such like, turn the center of your quadrat
toward your eye, and then looking through the sights thereof, til you can see
the very lower part of the hull of the Ship next the Water, note where the
thread cutteth the right parallel of the height of the platform above the
Water, for there passes by the contrary parallel of the distance of the ship
from the base of the platform, and if you place the bead to that intersection,
and then apply it to the side of the Quadrat, it shall there give you the
length of the visual line running from your eye to the ship. As for example,

Let B be the top of some high platform by the Sea coast, whose height is
known to be 60 paces or any other measure; and let it be required from B, to
find the distance of a ship lying at Road at A: first, therefore I turn the
Center toward my eye, and looking through the sights toward the ship at A,
moving it up and down till I can through the sights epsy the very lowest part
of the hull of the ship next the Water, I find the thread to cut the right
parallel of 60, at the contrary parallel of 180; and so much is AC the distance
of the ship at A, from the base of the clift or platform, lying
perpendicularly under the Center of your instrument at C: and if to this
intersection of the parallel of 60, with the parallel of 180, you place the
bead, and then apply it to the side of the Quadrat, it shall there give you
very near 190, and such is the length of the visual line, passing from your
eye at B, to the ship at A as was required.

This conclusion serves most co^modiously for all such as shall have committed
to their charge any platform with ordnance, for hereby you may exactly at the
first view, tell the distance of any ship or other mark from you; so that no
Vessel can pass by your platform, but you may with your Ordnance at the first
bough her, and never bestow vain shot, this Instrument serves also (and is no
less commodious) for all such as shall keep amount within any Town of War,
whence you desire with shot to beat enemy aloof of, before he shall approach
nigh, with many more such like conclusions, which the ingenious will soon
conceive.

CHAP. LIX. How by this Instrument, from a high Platform, to measure the
distance of any two ships on the sea, or other marks on the land, howsoever
they be situated, and that right speedily.
FOr this purpose and the like, let there be an Index with sights fitted to
turn upon the center, and let it be divided into such equal divisions as the
side of the Quadrat is. This index being in a readiness, get the distance of
each ship from your station, by the last Chap. and if they be both in a right
line from you, take the lesser distance out of the greater, and the remainder
will be their distance.

But if they be otherwise situate, find the angle between them by help of your
Index, which being found, count the lesser distance upon the side of the
Quadrat, and the greater on the Index, so shall the distance taken with a pair
of Compasses, give you the distance of the two ships required.

FINIS.
