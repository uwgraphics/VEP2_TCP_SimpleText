SOME CONSIDERATIONS Relating to the WOOLLEN-MANUFACTORY, Humbly offered To the
great Council of PARLIAMENT, BY SOME Merchants and others of the City of
London, and elsewhere.
WHereas the Woollen-Manufactory is well known to be the richest Treasure in
his Majesty's Dominions, the Strength and Sinews of this Nation; and the
maintaining and encouragement thereof is of such absolute necessity, that it
cannot be reasonably expected the Nation should flourish or prosper without the
same:

There is hereby humbly offered to the consideration of this honorable House,
the great ruin and decay of the said Manufactory, especially as relating to
the foreign Exportation thereof, for France, Flanders, Holland, and other
neighboring parts; that unless timely prevented, the same will necessarily
more decrease, and at length be wholly destroyed.

The chief and greatest cause of such decay, being the private Exportation of
our own and Irish Wool to the aforesaid foreign parts, in such great and
considerable quantities, that the same may be purchased there near as cheap as
we can have it brought to several of our own Markets: the Exporter, according
to computation, not gaining thereby (after running all the hazard) above 6 or 7
per Cent. By which plentiful supply, together with those excellent methods
practicable amongst them, especially in Holland and Zealand, for setting their
Poor on work, they have their Goods made much the cheaper. And also the great
Duties they impose on the Importation of our Woollen Manufactories, epsecially
in the French Dominions, thereby they not only beat us out of trade in most of
their own Markets which before we supplied, but may also be suspected in short
time (if they continue to improve themselves so much as of late years, and
having such plentiful supplies of our Wool) to be able to dispute with us for
great part of our other foreign Trade in the said Manufactory.

It being undeniable that the French take off few or none of our middle and
low-pric'd Clothes, Stuffs, or Druggets, because with the easy supply of our
English and Irish Wool, they themselves make the same or other sorts
answerable thereto, which without the said Wool they cannot reasonably effect
to the least of their own advantage, or prejudice to ours; and albeit they take
from us some small quantity of our finer sort of Broad Cloth, yet that is the
less considerable, the same Cloth being composed the most of Spanish, and the
least part of our own Wool.

And as for the French Conquests, as Lille, Armentiers, Valenciennes, and other
parts adjacent, it is well known that of late years they are so much improved in
the Woollen-Manufactory, being chiefly encouraged thereto by the frequent
supplies of our English and Irish Wool, that they not alone supply their own
and neighboring Markets with the same, but others also at a considerable
distance.

The like proves also true of the Inhabitants in and about Liege, whom being
plentifully supplied with Irish Wool from Holland and Zealand, have of late
years so much increased in the manufacturing of Woollen, especially of a sort
of low-pric'd Cloth in imitation of our Northern Dozens, that they maintain
their Factors in many other parts for vending the same, which they also do at
as (if not more) reasonable rates than can be afforded from hence.

And as for Holland and Zealand, etc. we are under much the same cimcumstances
with them as relating to the Woollen-Manufactory; it being observable, that
what they take from us is chiefly some Stuffs, together with some few Northern
Dozens, Kerseys, and other low-pric'd goods, whereon is the least advantage,
and wherewith they can be furnished from Hull and other out-Ports at such low
rates, that they think it not worth their while to make the same, as finding a
greater advantage to themselves in the finer sort of Woollen-Manufactories,
with which they not only supply their own, but also many foreign Markets, to
our great detriment, there being nothing that can make them capable of so
doing, but their industry, and methods of keeping their Poor at work, together
with their frequent supplies of our English, Scotch, and Irish Wool, and
Fullers-earth.

Much more might be offered to consideration, not only in respect of the
forementioned parts, but also of several others which lie under the same
circumstances; as also there might without much digression be sufficiently
demonstrated, the great loss that accrews to our Nation through the Exportation
of Wool, so that each Pack to the value of about Ten Pound, has been computed
at near two Hundred Pound damage to the King and Kingdom, but the chief intent
hereof is, by making evident in some degree the declining condition of the said
Manufactory, thereby to enforce the great necessity of some convenient method
for the Re-establishment and encouraging of the same; to which end the
following Attempt is humbly proposed, always with submission to better
Judgments.

It being very observable that the former Act of Parliament whereby the
Exportation of Wool is made Felony, has very little contributed to the
preventing the same, for that no provision is made thereby for the
encouragement of the Informer; which if it were, yet few or none would be
willing to inform against or prosecute another (especially in such cases) where
their lives are concerned: It is therefore humbly proposed, that the said
Clause in that Act may be repealed, and in stead thereof some others inserted
which may be more effectual for its intended end.

The which is humbly conceived to be, by providing a sufficient encouragement
for the Informer, and that no Wool shall be permitted to be lodged but at a
convenient distance from the Seashore; and that if any Wool shall be
discovered within that distance, especially after Sunsetting, to be carried
either by Cart, Horse, or otherwise, that the same shall not only be
forfeited, together with the said Cart, Horse, etc. but also the Owners whole
Estates; and the Driver of the said Cart or Horse to endure a years
Imprisonment. And that if any Wool shall be found in small Package, or
Screw-pack'd, that the same shall not only be forfeited, but the person with
whom it is found shall forfeit four double the value. And if it shall be proved
that Wool has been carried by Cart, Horse, or other ways within such a
distance of the Seacoast as before proposed, or that it shall be proved that
any Wool has been conveyed on board, or Exported from any of the said Coasts,
if the said Carriers, Owners, or Exporters have no Estate to forfeit, or are
not apprehended to receive due punishment, the Division or Hundred (as in cases
of Robberies) shall have a considerable Fine laid upon them for the same. And
that if any Wool be found privately conveying or conveyed on board any Vessel,
the same shall be forfeit; the Owner or Exporter thereof, if found, shall not
only forfeit his whole Estate, but also be transported to serve on board the
Galleys, together with the Master of the said Vessel, and his said Company; or
else to endure imprisonment proportionably. And that if any Wool be proved to
be exported, the Owner or Exporter thereof being made known within a year and a
day after such Fact committed, the said Owner or Exporter shall not only
forfeit their whole Estates, but also be transported, as aforesaid: which is
yet more favorable than Felony. And that for the greater encouragement of the
Informer, although he was a person concerned or employed in the exportation of
Wool, he shall not only receive his Pardon for the same, but also the
proposed Reward for his said Information. And for what relates to Ireland, it is
humbly proposed, That whereas it is there customary, when Wool is shipped off
for England, to give Security it shall be delivered accordingly; yet
afterward, by procuring a Certificate, in bribing of the Officers, at some of
the Ports of this Nation, as if the Wool were delivered there, they get the
said security in Ireland to be discharged, notwithstanding they carry the said
Wool to foreign parts: That therefore if the Master of the said Ship, or any
of his Company, or other persons whatsoever, shall within a year and a day
after such Fact committed, make the same appear to such Officers as shall be
appointed to that end, so as that the said Owner, Exporter, or Officers so
corrupted may be secured, the Informer shall be immediately paid for his said
Information 200 l. The Owner, Exporter, or Officers so corrupted, shall forfeit
their whole Estates, be made incapable of ever bearing after any Office; and
moreover, they shall (be confined to Prison for a considerable time, or) be
transported, as beforementioned.

It is also conceived to be very necessary, that any Discoverer, or other
single Witness, though he has profit thereby, ought to be sufficient Evidence;
it being better for us to run the hazard that one man in seven years be injured
by the perjury of an Informer, than that so many vile Offenders escape for want
of Witness, who have no benefit by the seizure and evidence.

Now whereas it may be alleged, that our Wool so prevented from exportation
will increase so much in quantity, and be brought so low in price at home, that
the Owners, Grasiers, Farmers, etc. will be thereby impoverished.

Against which it is humbly offered, that there are two ways to prevent the
said inconveniencie: The first and best being to manufacture all the Wool at
home; the Method for which has been already made public by Mr. Richard
Haines, and approved of by many Honorable Members of the House, as well as
Merchants and others.

The other is, That the Wool of the Nation increasing too much, it may be once
in three or four years wholly destroyed, and the value made good by a public
Contribution: but the many and great inconveniences that will consequently
follow this latter, and can sufficiently be demonstrated, will, as is humbly
conceived, render the same altogether unpracticable.

The Consideration of all which, is humbly represented to this Honorable
House, to the intent, that when they have settled the Peace and Security of the
Nation, care may be taken for its Welfare and Prosperity; which (as at any time
shall be sufficiently demonstrated) consists in nothing mroe than the
Improvement and Encouragement of the Woollen-Manufactury.

FINIS.
