The Resolution, Vow, and Covenant of 4736 Persons in and about the City of
London.
WHereas by the Votes of both Houses of Parliament, that no Addresses be made
to the King, his Majesty is totally outed of his Government, and by his
imprisonment the reverence and high esteem due to his Royal Person is much
lessened, if not (with some) totally withdrawn, his Person with more
opportunity and secrecy exposed to private Murder and Poison (as appears by
late experience) and his Majesty's Attendants being only such as the Faction of
Independents (opposite to Kingly Government) have against his Majesty's liking,
placed about his Person, there cannot want Executioners for any secret and
bloody design.

And for that the many Petitions to both Houses of Parliament, for his
Majesty's freedom and return to Parliament, have received only dilatory and
fruitless answers: We cannot esteem the Houses of Parliament so careful of
the honor and safety of his Majesty's Person, as they have often pretended.

We therefore do hereby publish to the World that we have solemnly
promised and vowed to God, that if our Sovereign Lord the King shall by
Murder, Poison, or otherwise depart this life (which God forbid) before his
enlargement and freedom from Prison, we shall esteem it (as all good
Subjects will) the effect of his restraint and hard usage, and them (detaining
his inlargment) as the abetters thereof, and shall accordingly (though with the
hazard and loss of our own lives) stricktly and severely require his blood at
the hands of all such who denied or delayed (upon what pretenses soever) his
and their voice or assistance for his Majesty's enlargement, and doubt not but
we shall herein find aid and assistance from very many thousands of Loyal
Subjects.

God bless King CHARLES.
