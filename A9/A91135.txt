Shall the King pay so much Interest, because he did not give the money sooner,
or pay it so soon as it was promised?

A Copy of the Paper with the Kings Hand to it, of such monyes as he allowed
the Lord Treasurer Portland to receive.
When your most Excellent Majesty was pleased to Conferr upon your most humble
Servant, the place of Treasurer of England, he made your Majesty acquainted,
how unable he was to support that Estate, and how unwilling to draw any of your
profits or revennew pertaining to your Majesty; you were pleased to give him
leave to acquire some Means to himself, by such suits and businesses which
passed through his Hands; which without your Majesty's knowledge he would not
have done, and has from time to time acquainted your Majesty therewith, but
does now for your Majesty's better satisfaction make remembrances of such
monyes as he has had, to be subject to your Majesty's veiw.

1. When your Majesty made a grant of your preemption of Tin, though the
present Farmers pay more yearly then the former would give, yet they freely
gave your humble Servant. 1000. L. 2. Within a while after you were pleased to
bestow of your Majesty's abundant Grace on your Servant for his present
support. 10000. 3. James Maxwell gave him for the Office of the Clark of the
Court of Wards 1000. 4. Sir W. Withypoole for pardoning his burning in the Hand
500. 5. The E. of Cork at his departure, presented your Servant as a mere
gift 1000. 6. The Duches of Buckingham gave him 1000. 7. Sir Sackvile Crow
1000* 8. Sir Philip Caryes Office 1000. 9. A great debt was owing to
Burlemachie for which he was willing to accept of a Lease of the Sugars, for
satisfaction of above 50000. l. which though it was thought a hard bargain to
him, yet he well knowing how to manage it, of his own accord after the
bargain made, without contract or demand proferred your Servant 10000. l.
wherewith he acquainted your Majesty, and by your approbation accepted it, and
there was paid unto him 9000. L. 10. Mr. Fanshew for the Office of Clerk of the
Crown 1000. 11. Sir Allen Apslye at several times 4000. 12. Of the Earl of
Barkeshire for the Green-wax. 1000. 13. Of Sir Arthur Ingram for the changing
of his lives* for his Pattent of the Secretaryship of York. 2000. 14. Of Sir
Corn: Vermuden for my part of adventure in the Leadmynes, which he allowed, and
afterward redeemed of me 6000. 15. Of Mrs. Bagnall for her Ward. 500. 16. The
third part of the Imposition upon Coals 4000.


I have taken all these several particulars into my Consideration, and do
acknowledge your clear and true dealing with me in the matters and sums
above mentioned, and in acquainting me with them, from time to time, and
weighing with my self the good service you have done me in the Treasurership,
and the great charge you have and must be at in the sustaining of that place, I
do approve and allow of all these monyes by you, to your own use, in all
amounting to 44500. l. sterling.

At Hampton Court the 21. of October, 1634. CHARLES R.

This Paper was Copied out by the Archbishops own hand, with this
Endorsement: Rece. April 5. 1635. by which you may discern; that Lord
Treasurers knew how to enrich themselves by suits and bribes.
