London, Printed in the Year 1647.

REASONS why the House of Commons ought In Justice forthwith to suspend the
Members charged by the Army, from sitting in the House, and to proceed in
Judgment against them, Or else the City is obliged by way of requital to help
the Army to Justice upon them.
WHerein to speak with all due Reverence to the Honorable House, the question
rightly stated will be thus; Whether it be any breach of privilege to require
such a present suspention for such reasons and matters which are already fully
known to the House, having been acted in the House, or there examined and fully
proved? Or whether those other high misdemeanors charged against them ought
first to be proved, which will require some time, and I conceive that there
ought to be an immediate and present Sequestration of their persons from that
great Counsel; and that I may make forth this truth for the satisfaction of the
intelligent Reader, in point of rational conviction, grounded upon the Laws of
this Kingdom; I shall premise a few Considerations and argue the point as in
quiet times upon the Law of the Land, which is the only rule of justice in
times of peace.

1. That it has ever been the course of all arbitrary Courts, not to suffer
their privileges to be questioned, nor to be known to any, but to themselves;
that so when they are minded to oppress any Clyent, if they be non-plust in
point of reason, they may fly to the course of the Court, and say it is but the
privilege of the Court, as King James in his speech in the Star Chamber says
that the privileges of that Court were so transcendent that they were not to
be disputed by common Lawyers, and charged the Chancellor to check the
presumptuous boldness of such Lawyers as durst argue and dispute of the limits
and extents of his Prerogative, and the decapitated Archbishop in the high
Commission Court made an express Inhibition that no Minster should preach of
Predestination and matters of such high concernment; and formerly in the Court
of Wards, he that argued for the King, to finda Tonure to fetter and clog the
subjects Lands, could never want a reason; for if neither Common Law; nor
Statute law, not Custom, not the Kings Prcrogativo could carry it, then it was
the privilege of the Coure so to do; that if the Counsel should say, give my
Client what is his due by the Common Law, then says the Court give us what is
our due by the privilege of the Court, the Honor and Rites whereof we sit here
to maintain; and upon that ground the Papists made marriage a Sacrament, that
if Caesar should say give me my due, marriage belongs to the Civil Magistrate;
the Answer is, give God his due, Sacraments belong to the Church; and so it was
in our Spiritual (or rather Carnal) Courts, when the unreasonableness of
Excommunication for trifles was objected, oh tis' the privilege of the Court so
to do.

But blessed be God the subject is well infranchised in these Particulars, and
yet King Charles must have his due, the Army have declared their desires
therein, and his Majesty says he desires no more, and certainly he deserves no
less: I cannot but observe what plotting there is to make the Kings late party
believe that his Majesty dislikes the Armies proceedings; one B. Rheymes
informing the Right Honorable the House of Peers thereof; a Relation was
printed by Order, as was but just for every Court gives indubitate credence to
informations, (...) the contrary appear, or (...); (...) every (...) to
consider of the improbability of it; that the King should desire private
conference with (...) stronger (for the (...) was never any Courtier nor so
much as known to the King) is very strange to me, and the Relation indeed is
repugnant in it self, for my own part I think it is something like the Romish
Translation, and not a word of (...) true, for I find the Areny expressing the
contrary, and where his Majesty's best interest and hopes lie, I refer the
Reader to the Kingdoms (...) lately printed, with this, that King Charles shall
be King of Pree men governing according to just and whole some Laws, by which
to command one man is more honorable in the Judgment of men that are truly so,
then to have absolute power of life and death over ten thousand Galley slaves.

2. Concerning the Pavliament privileges, there are very few Cases printed in
any Law books, the Houses have always been the proper Judges of their own
Proviledges: the Journal books and books of Remembrances and Orders in both
Houses being matters of Record and Registers of their Privileges and
Proceedings, and when a special case happen for which there is no President
then right Reason must be judge.

For the Honerable House of Commons, the represenvdtive body of the Kingdom,
the privileges of that House are great, for Parliament are must being the
greatest (...) in the Kingdom; the Trustees must have inswrabld Privileges;
now a Privilege is private (...), an Exemption from some general Law for the
ease and benefit of the privileged party, and a private Law must be (...) as
well as a public Law, but the power of the House is far above the privilege of
the House, they being empowered for the common good; and themselves privileged
for the better carrying on of the same.

The first day of Parliament M. Speaker in his speech to the King always
concludes with a prayer in the name of the House that they may enjoy their
ancient and undoubted privileges, the essentials whereof are Three.

First, freedom from Ar^es^^ for themselves their necessary servants.

2. Freedom of debate, the very life of Counsels

3. That they may not be drawn (...), but ^yed by themselves, unless for
Treasons or Felonies, which are apparently so, as if a Member should kill a man
there is no question but he ought to be tried by the Common Law, which is the
common arbiter of life and death.

This being laid as a substratum and groundwork, I conceive thereby that if
any considerable number of men, free from all faction and conspiracy, shall by
Petition or Remonstrance, which is an humble way, make a complaint to the House
of Ten or Twenty of the Members, charging them with high misdemeanors, and
amongst the rest that they by artisicial practices seduce the House and poison
the very fountain of Justice, that they cause divisions between the Parliament
and the Kingdom, and such men as have given most large testimonies of their
cordial affections to the Parliament and Kingdom, and are ready to aver and
make good their Charge, praying that the parties may be suspended from voting
in the House for the present; this Petition ought to be granted for these
Reasons.

1. Because the suspension is but in order to the trial; A Petition to the
House is equivalent to an original writ; upon every action or accusation
something by the Law must be done in order to the trial: a man is arrested for
money, possibly there is nothing due; yet bail must be given or the party
imprisoned before the right of the matter appears: If the Charge be for treason
the party is not bailable, the punishment is so heinous, unless in some special
case, or that malice is evident; if for felony, in some cases the Judges will
take bayl, if the party be not taken in committing the crym; if for other
offenses and misdemeanors, the matter, nature, and rise of the Charge is
principally considerable; but always something must be done in order to the
trial; As for any bayl or caution to answer the Charge it is improper, but the
first thing properly to be don is suspension from the House, that they may do no
more hurt in the House, and this is but in the nature of an Injunction to
prevent further mischief; which is granted in ordinary Courts of Justice, upon
a bare suggestion that a man has Committed waste and spoil upon the ground
before the title be tried, an injunction is granted to stay any further wastes.
The writ called de leproso amovendo, to remove a Leper is granted upon a bare
suggestion, before it be tried, whether the party be a Laper^^ not, that the
healths of others may not be endangered.

2. This can be no prejudice to the Members, for if the Honst please to hear
the proofs, the matter may be ended in a short time; but if they sit there, it
cannot be imagined (whatsoever they may pretend) that they desire a speedy
trial, if the House please to suspend them, but for a month, and hear the
proofs in that time, what prejudice can it be in right reason? The matter of
every Charge where no malice is apparent, is presumed to be true, and that is
the reason that the Law favors the Plaintiff, presuming the cause of Action to
be just; for though the most confident Accusation, is not the least proof to
condemn, for then none should be Innocent, yet it is a violent presumption that
it is true, and the party to be seoured, for the Law says that a Common fame
that says a man is guilty of felony is sufficient cause for a Justice of peace
to Restrain a man's Liberty, a thing in law most precious. Now no malice can be
presumed in the Army toward the Members accused, they which have ventured
their lives for the Parliament and Kingdom, can be supposed to intend nothing
but the Common good. what they do is for the pure love of Justice, they and the
whole Kingdom desire peaee, and speedy Justice; which only can cure the
Consumption of this Kingdom; these are the principal obstructers of Justice,
and hinderers of poor Irelands releif, and these men to accomplish their
ambitious ends, study to imbroyl this poor Kingdom in a second and more bloody
war; and care not to set all on fire; so as they may Nerelike warm themselves:
and so great is their influence in the Honorable House, that so long as they
sit there, no Reformation can be expected, and therefore they ought to be
suspended.

But it may be demanded, Object.
why may not these men sit in the House and vote in other matters, till the
whole Charge be proved against them?

By no means for so the matter will be endless, men that have cunning wits will
drive every Vote to their own ends: Respon.
when the House or Committee should sit to hear the complants against them,
they shall procure an order to put it off for ten days, or bring on other
businesses, and pretend absence of witnesses; besides, as upon every Summons at
Law there are fifteen days given, so is it in Committees, Tediens protractions,
and dangerous delays, which the Condition of the Army cannot admit, to go a
Circular course of Law against them, by way of Bil, Answer, and Replication;
but if they were not guilty of the matters Charged against them they would not
fear being suspended: some of them can be out of the House months together,
for their own ease or profit, why should not the House do right to the Army in
this particular?

Obs. But must not the House preserve it self? if Ten Members may be suspended
in this manner, why not as well Twenty or a Hundred, and so the whole House might
be dissolved, and so a failer of Justice.

Resp. No suchmatter, every Court has an intrinsecal power, by the Rules of
Law to conserve it self: if the chief Justice of the Kings bench or common
Pleas be liable to any action, the writ may be taken out against him in the
name of the Secondary Judgs and so against Three Judges, in the name of the
Fourth. But if the four Judges be all bound in one bound jointly, this Bond
cannot be sued against them all in this Court, for then there would be a failer
of Justice; they may not be Judges in their own case, but one or two of the
Judges may be sued in their own Court, and they are to be Removed from off the
bench, and sit below amongst the officers of the Court, uncovered; and
therefore one of the Judges, in the Queens time, being sued in an action of
Debt, because he might not sit in the Court while the Action against him was
depending, by consent came to a speedy trial, and the matter was ended in a day
or two; what a happy thing would it be for this Kingdom, if every man's cause
might be ended so soon, or at least in a month or two, the Lord grant it may
be so.

But out the case, that there was a Law that no Member of the House of Commons
should be suspended, nor accused, but by the Oaths of Twenty witnesses, as the
Cardinals are not to be Impeached but by Twenty Accusers, shall an Army of such
gallant faithful men that have been Instruments to save the Kingdom, be subject
to a dead Letter? the Kingdom now entreats them to see Iustine done, shall the
Houses to gratify those few Incendiaries endanger the ruin of the whole
Kingdom? or shall the Army to preserve an unnecessary privilege, neglect to see
the Common Rights, and Libertys of the people settled, which they have fought for
all this while? must we to prevent a small inconvenience enforce a greater?
there is no previledge of the House of Commons that must stand in competition
with the safety of the people: the Law is Lord of particular cases and persons,
but the universal good is Lord over it: what Law was there to restrain any man
from going between Oxford and London, but the safety of the people? and what
schism is it in the body, to pull out an aching tooth, though seated in the
head? This is a far stronger case then Straffords or Canterburies, who yet
lay long in prison before they were tried: the Army are so far from the
least face of revenge, that though these men have voted them enemies to the
State, for that which the Parliament since acknowledge to be just, that they do
not so much as desire to have them imprisoned, which in justice they might well
expect, but they desire only their absence from the House, that their hands
and tongues may be tied from doing further hurt to the Kingdom.

If the case of the five Members should be objected, there is no comparison
between them; for the King cannot accuse any subject; and they were demanded in
a hostile manner, because they voted for the liberty of the people; but these
Members of late have voted nothing in the House, but merely to inslave the
people: he that was one of the five, is as a star fallen from heaven, which was
no star, but a Comet: it is pity good parts should be employed to make slaves
of those that entrusted them.

But still it will be said, can words make any man guilty? I answer, their
actions clearly bespeake their intentions, which is the ruin of this Army, to
disgrace and oppress every man that will not conform to their practices, but
stands in the way of their Domination, to Lord it over the Lords inheritance;
all their Votes tend to inslave them whom they should enfranchise; and it is
most apparent that they neither intend to do right to the King nor the people:
This is sufficiently known to the House, that these were the principal actors
in procuring that hasty Declaration against this Army, which is the wonderment
of Heathens, that men who with the venture of their lives had vindicated the
Petitions of Right, should be denied the right and Liberty to present their
grievances to their noble General, and this Declaration to be past in the
House late in the night, contrary to Order of the House, that it should not be
debated till the next day, when the Armies friends were gone away, and so the
House surprised, and abused; and these are the men that afterward of their
own accord, without any warrant from the House, called back those three
Regiments out of Worcestershire, that were going for the relefe of Ireland,
and what plotting there was between some of these Members, and the Reformadoes,
abetting them to come down to the House, and imprison the Members in the House
till some of them by their elegant speeches pacified them; and what high
affronts have been and are daily offered to those that are the Armies friends,
let but every reasonable man seriously consider, Whether the House in justice
has not sufficient clear ground to suspend these men from any longer sitting,
til the other heads of the Charge be clearly united; which if it be denied, if
the Army cannot find justice from the House in the Hundred, how shall they
expect it in the Shire? If these men have such an influence and power in the
House, that they may not be suspended in Order to a trial, what hopes has the
Army, that the House should inflict condign punishment upon them according to
their demerits, though I believe the Army desires they should be more
mercifully dealt withal then they intended toward the Army, had they been
disbanded?

If one strike a man in Westminster Hall, in the face of the Court, he shall
lose his hand without any further proof; and if the Court adjudge an Infant of
sixteen to be of full age, by inspection, there is no averment against it; now
not only the House, but every man that walks in Westminster Hall, knows that
these men are the principal firebrands in the House.

But come you worthy Citizens, what if the honorable House of Commons will not
do justice upon them, for my part I know no other way to the safety of this
Kingdom, (...) by the present suspending of these Members; for as sure as the
Lord is in heaven, if they continue in the House, they will imbroyle this
Kingdom in a new war, by private listings, inviting the Scots, or rather
then fail, to make a peace with the Irish Rebels, and bring them over,
calumniating the Army, or otherwise, what will you do in this case? pray let
me give you counsel without a fee; if it taste bitter, as I hope it will not,
to any found palate, swallow it down, for it is wholesome; do not I beseech
you (upon any pretenses) raise any Forces against this Army; do not allege you
must defend the City, of whom are you afraid? Is not the Army the best friend
that ever the City had, have they not been your strongest walls and Bulwarks?
will you be briars and thorns to them? had not your enemies long since
deflowred your Virgin City, had not they stood in the gap? Rejoice rather,
never such true cause of ringing the bells, and making bonefires, gallant Sir
Thomas Fairfax, and his Army, under God, preservers of your City, is coming;
now keep holyday, and write over your dooers, Victoria: this is the second
nativity of London, every thing shall be settled for the good of us, and this
Kingdom, as well as heart can wish; let us give them our best wine to drink,
that have ventured their lives for us; truly it is but justice so to do; it is
no charity to relieve that poor man that has saved my life; all the wealth in
the City is not sufficient to requite this Army: But me thinks I hear a poor
honest heart say, this would do well, if there were not a difference between
the Parliament and Army; good friend do not mistake, the Charge is not against
the Parliament, but some corrupt worms in the body, that are to be purged out,
that the Body Politic may be the sounder: but what if we be commanded to our
Arms? Oh consider what you do, and ask counsel from heaven! a war is
quickly begun but not easily ended, the first blow is like leaping into a deep
pit, or as opening the floud-gates; if there should be a breach between
Parliament and Army, which God forbid, who made it? who gives the first blow?
what had the Army done to be declared enemies, for presenting a Petition to the
noble General, which (by the Law of Arms, all soldiers have liberty to do)
in case they should persist in it? which since the Parliament has acknowledged
to be but just; and though that Declaration be since retracted, the unbending
of the bow does not heal the hurt made by the arrow; when the wound is cured
(though I think all sober men counted it at the best, but an impolitike and
hasty Declaration, full of ingratitude; to say no more of it) yet the scar
remains so far, as that it was a sufficient Declaration how the chief
promoters of it intended to deal with the Army when disbanded, Rebels,
Traitors Heretics, and Schismatics, men not worthy to have a mouthfull of
air in the Kingdom, though under God they had saved it; but when by their
means a blessed Reformation (for the good of this poor Kingdom) shall be
effected, and justice and common honesty shall be highly exalted; how will the
world then stand and admire, and say with David, mirabilis Deus in sanctis
suis, God is greatly to be admired in his Saints. Do but consider seriously of
it, for which of the Armies good works at Naesby, Bristow etc. must they in all
haste be stoned? Weigh their proceedings in an equal balance, since the
Charge sent up against the eleven Members, they have kept at a distance,
expecting justice to be done upon them, it cannot be obtained; they approach
the City for that purpose only: Oh bid them welcome, the sword is but the
servant of justice, and servants of justice are the Kingdoms best friends;
take heed you do them no wrong, my life on it they will do you none; you know
they are no cowards, when their cause is good, the justice of heaven is for
them, they have assisted you against those who had designed the ruin of your
famous City: It is but justice and common equity, that you should assist them
against those that had designed theirs, and in them the ruin of the whole
Kingdom; for believe it, under the specious pretenses of government, order,
and uniformity, the design of these men and their Accomplices, was no other
but to get the Kings power into their own hands, to monopolize all the great
places to themselves and their Adherents, to continue Grandees of Parliament
during their lives, and to make us the most absolute slaves that ever were in
this Kingdom, both for souls, bodies, and estates: consider further, what can
you get by opposing this Army, for though the Commanders and Officers be not
Soldiers of fortune, but Gentlemen of worth and quality, and few of the
soldiery but know how to live comfortably; for you see it is not money they
aim at, being acted by more noble principles, the love of justice, and virtue,
for which they first engaged, yet if they find resistance, nature justifies
selfe-defence, and justice must be done; you may lose much, and in the loss of
this Army, you and yours are likely to be inslaved for ever, you know God has
owned this Army as those that are holy, faithful, and chosen, and all Counties
where they come own them and love them, and fear nothing but their disbanding
before the peace of this Kingdom be settled, and the Liberties of the Subject
vindicated: pray read the 8. of Numbers, the Lord is with them, and the shout
of a King is amongst them.

Therefore as you love this Kingdom, make not the least head, nor face of
resistance against them; you and they are as two vessels at sea, if you clash
upon one another, you are broken: he that gives the first blow ingages the
Justice of Heaven against him, set open your gates, if you have no intestine
troublers, you may throw down your works; the Army under God, will be your
sufficient defense: do not object that to require justice in this manner is to
enforce the Parliament, force and right are opposed; force being properly of
things unlawful, it is no force to make a man to be honest; these Members
accused, might have acted and voted freely for the infranchisement of the
people, but they are not free to vote for our inslavement; it is a common
Argument, that by this means the Houses are overawed, and not in a free
capacity; but it bears not the weight of a feather: For;

1. God, and nature, law, and reason all command the execution of justice, and
he that ordaines the end, always appoints some means or other conducing to
that end: therefore, when the Liberty of a people cannot be settled but by a
defensive war, that must needs be lawful: but this is the case, there happens
an unhappy difference between the Houses, and the Army, the Parliament say,
they will make the Kingdom happy; the Army fears it, and says it will not be
done unless these Incendiaries be removed: Now the Question is, Whether the
Army ought not in Law and conscience to continue in arms till this difference
be ended, and there is nothing more clear, then that they ought; for it is a
rule in Law, and universal reason, that when a suit is begun all things must
rest as they then are till the matter be ended and adjudged, for to deliver up
the sword, is to release the right.

2. Here is no force unlawfully raised, but commissionated by the Parliament
for the freedom of themselves, and the whole Kindome, not to fight with an
implicit faith, but for justice, and common Liberties, and properties; and
there can no Argument be used against the Army, for whetting their glistering
swords, against the injustice of these men, and keeping them unsheathed until
the King and Kingdom be settled in Honor, and safty, but what may be
improved against the Parliament, for the first raiseing of this Army?

Let not these and such like Incendiaryes, nor their accomplices in pulpits nor
elsewhere, abuse you into any prejudices or jealousies, as that the Army was
raised and paid by the Parliament, and that the servants oppose their Masters;
just as the Bishops argued, we are the shepherds, ye are the sheep, shall
the sheep oppose the shepherds? it is the Kingdom that pays the Army, and
they contribute thereunto out of their own estates, but the Parliament are so
wise in all their declarations, to exempt themselves from payments; the Army
fight for themselves, and for the good of the Kingdom, and are true to their
first principles, Justice and Lawful Liberties, for the love whereof they will
adventure ten thousand lives a piece, if they had them: For my part, if they
should willingly disband, before our Liberties be settled and secured, I should
proclaim it to all the world, that they had betrayed us. Have honest men laid
out themselves to their very shirts, and must they now be trampled upon, and
made at the best hewers of wood and drawers of water, if so much favor may be
granted them, to breath in the Land of their nativity? How is justice vinegar
at the best, and gall to the most? Protestants by a new trick made Papists, and
indicted upon the Statutes of Recusants, honest men imprisoned every where, as
if it were no more to imprison a man then to whip a Schoole-boy; Petitions
burnt, a thing never heard of amongst Heathen Magistrates, that dries up the
fountain of all relief; and these persons are the chief incendiaries and
promoters of all these mischiefs; these are the Phaetons that would set all on
fire before the general conflagration at the day of judgment; for I have a
most reverent and honorable esteem of many in both Houses, who in my
conscience, really and sincerely, without those unworthy and base ends of
enriching themselves upon the ruins of others, intend the glory of God, and
the good of this Kingdom, but are over-voted and silenced, as wheat lies
buried amongst the chafe.

Therefore, this being no time to write much; All you honest Citizens, go down
to the Parliament, and cry Justice, Justice, against these men; take your
Bibles, and mark well the 20. Chapter of the second Book of Samuel, let these
Sheba's be but suspended the House and justice done upon them, and the Army, if
you desire it, will make an honorable retreat, so as they may have moneys not
to be chargeable to the almost quite exhausted Countries: The Army desires an
account of the many millions of money that have been raised for the Kingdoms
service: In the name of God, let the Treasurers, Committee Men, and those that
have swallowed down the money, vomit it up again; why should they not? let
quick and cheap justice be done to rich and poor; I assure you, the work will
be glorious if you hinder it not; if you make any opposition against this Army,
you are undone. Farewell the glory of London-Towne: the Lord give you wisdom
to know your friends from your foes: In this will Gods love be manifest to the
city: I hope your unthankful Remonstrance may be forgotten, because you were
at the first a Sanctuary for honest men; I trust God will inspire you to
foresee and prevent your ruin, which can only be by complying with this Army,
for which I shall pray and conclude my self an unfeigned well-wisher of peace
and truth, of the honor of the King, and just Rights and Liberties of the
Parliament and Kingdom.

FINIS.
