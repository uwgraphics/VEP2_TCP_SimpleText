A Letter of Advice, From a secluded Member of the House of Commons, To his
Excellency, Thomas Lord Fairfax, TO Admonish him of the Kings danger, his own
duty, and the sad consequence of Oppression and Tyranny.

All whose extremes are only to be avoided by His Majesty's Safety, and the
defense of his Royal Person and Honor.

Delivered on Saturday December. 30.

Printed in the Year 1649.

SIR,
IT is not only rumor'd but remonstrated (you, as is supposed, forbidding it)
that the Kings life must shortly pass upon a dangerous unequal trial; that
being (it seems) the hallowed prey which these unsanctified sons of the earth,
reprobate to all Faith and Government, but what they pile up in their own
wicked Imaginations, run greedily to seize upon: it is true this Land has been
twice polluted already with the blood of her Princes, but how the first
violence was visited upon the actors with an implacable vengeance, and 200000.
lives sacrificed by offended Justice, for a revenge of the second, our
Chronicles have sufficiently witnessed.

To kill a King the Lords Anointed, by private conspiracy, and for particular
interests, is questionless an impiety deserving the extremes of hate and
punishment, to be inflicted upon the Confederates; but for Subjects to
solemnize their Sovereigns murder with a pretended legality, and usurp the
power to be themselves his Judges, (then which nothing can be more rediculous
in sense, a greater enemy to reason, or more opposite to divine and humane
Laws) must needs appear a very monstrous prodigy, and affrightfull to every
loyal contemplation: and the rather, because the act being by order, consent
or connivency, made a national crime, will hardly be expiated without a
national ruin.

The power is now yours, you will be certain of the hearts of thousands, and
the assurance of their hands to justify your resolutions if they be fervent,
as is hoped, for the Kings safety: and the means is likewise not wanting to
make a timely prevention of the most execrable villainy that ever tainted any
Christian Kingdom: Let not therefore so general an expectation relying (under
God) upon your self alone, be beguiled, but rowze your self my Lord, to
suppress these blasphemers, your design (in this particular) being
encompassed with the Ordinances of God to guard it: His Angels to be your
guide, and a just cause to make you triumphant, by which religious undertaking,
your life will be made honorable, your memory renowned; whereas,

If you slight this opportunity (whereof heaven and men invite you to so
glorious a trial) and fashion your self to behold your Sovereigns fall, with
commanding, or indifferent eyes, what can you then expect, when the next danger
shall look black upon your self like a doomes day, but trembling from a divine
wrath, and judgments that are due to such a guilty Aspirer: for though you
strip Majesty naked, and rob him of all his regal State, and Ornaments, yet
that will be your Epithere.

Make (my Lord) Quintus Curtius your companion, but for a few hours, and he
will offer you the full view of a famous Traitor, called Bessus, whose story be
pleased to make so far your own, as by a wise anticipation of Loyalty, to
decline both his fault and fortune: That Bactrian General would have no pity
upon his woeful Lord, distressed Darius, a Prince whom for mer misfortunes had
disarmed of all defense, and humbled him to the disdaines and oppression of
that his most wicked servant; who first finished his Lords Tragedy with
dishonorable wounds, saw himself next made King of Bactria, by a military
Election. And lastly, in chains, within few months at the mercy of a just
Alexander, who not only designed him to a deserved death, but appointed him
the way to it by most exquisite torments for his presumption and treachery:
Believe it my Lord, the Throne that was temperate to King Charles, will be (to
you) a burning one.

The rents in the Church; the Divisions among the People, with the violation of
Laws, Liberties and Government, all carry your name, and you the burden of a
general dislike, for allowing protection to such outrageous insolences as are
acted daily; your self not marking (so blind is Ambition) what loose earth the
state of your own fortune stands upon; ready, by the removing of a few weak
props, to sink under you at the pleasure only of your underminers, who (it is
strongly fancied) are now digging your Lordships grave.

If any Peter's live about you, which having finally denied their Master, would
tempt you Sir to the same infidelity, upon peril of your soul my Lord, bid
that Satan avoid, and cast his charms behind you, it being certain that if his
Majesty die by the means, as is projected, not only Religion, and the ancient
honor of the Noble English Nation, (whereof your Lordship pretends to be the
selected Champion) but your own peace of Conscience, and hope of heaven for
ever, must die with him: for could Judas repent, after he had betrayed the
innocent blood? you see it was impossible: yet Judas was an Apostle, who it is
believed wrought more miracles in a few months by the Word, then your Lordship
shall ever be able to do by your sword, though the years of your life might be
ten times doubled.

The Message of Pilates wife to her husband, in the behalf of Gods most holy
Son, will be the best conclusion and advertisement to your Lordship touching
his Royal Lieutenant, and your dread Sovereign Charles: Have thou nothing to
do with that just man: suffer any thing, sleeping or waking for his
preservation, but let his life be the Jewel of your care, from that infallible
and grounded Principle of David: Destroy him not, for who can stretch forth his
hand against the Lords Anointed, and be innocent!

Which is the humble Prayer not only of your Lordships servant, but of all
honest men, whose eyes now look upon you for the Kings deliverance, E.S.

FINIS.
