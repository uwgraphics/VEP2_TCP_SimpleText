Salutem and Officia in Christo Jesu.
Good Brother,
FInding my self obliged by his MAJESTY's most Gracious Letters Patents, for
the Relief of the French that have lately taken Refuge in this Kingdom, to give
a particular Recommendation to the Clergy of my Diocese, for the Advancement of
so Pious and Charitable a Work, I do with all the willingness and earnestness
imaginable Recommend it to your most effectual and speedy Care, That you will
press for a Bountiful Contribution, by your making such a Christian
Representation of their Deplorable Wants as is set forth in his MAJESTY's said
Royal Letters; and that you will concern your self in the management of this
Affair, with all the Compassion and Tenderness due to Strangers, and to great
Numbers of Strangers in extreme necessity; and lastly, to Protestant Strangers,
which is another Qualification mightily to endear them to you, especially they
bringing along with them so good Inclinations as they do of Conformity to the
Church of England; to promote this very seasonable and most Noble Charity,
nothing is like to be more conducive on your part, than your own leading good
Example added to your Exhortations, this being indeed a Case so extraordinary,
as calls for our Assistance to the utmost of our Abilities. I beseech God (in
the words of our Churches most excellent Collect) to stir up the Wills of his
Faithful People, that they plenteously bringing forth the Fruit of Good Works,
may of Him be plenteously rewarded. So prays

Your most assured Friend, and most Affectionate Brother in Christ, FRANCIS
ELY, Almoner to his Majesty.
