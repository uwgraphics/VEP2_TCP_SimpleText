TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE LORDS AND COMMONS NOW ASSEMBLED IN THIS PRESENT
PARLIAMENT.
The humble Petition of the Inhabitants in the County of ESSEX,
SHOWS:
THat We your Petitioners, true members of this Church and State, being
sensible of the present Distractions and bloody Miseries wherein this Nation is
most unhappily involved, whereby the ruin of our Religion, Estates, Lives and
Liberties, is inevitably threatened, in a most unnatural and unchristian
manner; the nearest and dearest relations Plotting and Acting Destruction each
to other: Neither is this our so great Misery bounded within our selves, but it
extends it self to our poor Brethren of bleeding- Ireland, not only to the
ruin of their Persons and Estates, but even to the utter extirpation of the
Protestant Religion it self in that miserable Kingdom, by disabling us to
afford them that timely aid and assistance which in truth was due unto them.
The tender consideration of the Premises does enforce us humbly to address our
selves to the favor and wisdom of this Honorable Court for relief; not
doubting, but that the blessing of GOD meeting with your grave and timely
endeavors, may yet put a Period to these our miserable Distractions. And to
that end, we have addressed our selves by Petition to His sacred MAJESTY.

And therefore do in all humility beg, you would be pleased seriously to
consider of our present approaching Calamities; and before any more blood be
shed, to tender (with all possible convenient speed) unto our gracious
SOVEREIGN, such Propositions for Accommodation, as may be for the Preservation
of the true Protestant Religion, his Majesty's safety and Honor, the peace
and prosperity of all his Subjects.

And we shall pray, etc.
