TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL Sir WILLIAM LYTTON One of the Knights in Parliament,
for the County of Hertford.
SIR,
IT is a fault sometimes in good men, when they write to great men, to be too
large in their praises, far beyond their deserts; but Jobs rule shall be my
guide, not to give flattering titles unto man. Your Father, Sir Rowland Lytton,
being long dead, yet speaks, there being in St. Hieromes phrase, concerning
Asella, Sermo silens, and Silentium loquens; a silent speech, and a speaking
silence: his works of love to God, godliness, and good men, speak aloud in
the ears of his Country, his name being very precious among them; Your self
to my knowledge did express your love to God and your Country, and that in the
hardest times, to the hazarding of your own Liberty, and Fortunes, if not
more: And all this while you have, with that Honorable Court, borne the
burden and heat of the day: yet they and you are not without some that are
ready to murmr against you; It puts me in mind of Africanus Superior, who as
Valor. Maxim. lib. 5. cap. 3. reports, made the City of Rome, (being in a
Consumption, and ready to give up the Ghost) Lady of Afrique; but see his
requital: Afterward, being Banished into a poor Country Town, his will was,
that his Tomb should have this Inscription upon it; Ingrata Patria ne ossa
quidem mea, unthankefull Country, thou have not so much as my bones. I know You
have had a tender care, with others, to recover Englands consumption. And while
with laboring for your Countries good, you bring your self to the Cineres ei
suos negavit, quam in Cineres Collabi pastus non fuerat, Valor. ibid.
dust, I desire you may not (through the misapprehension of some, and
indiscretion of others) have cause to cry out, Ingrata Patria! O unthankefull
Country! God still make you constant to him, loyal to your Prince, loving to
your Country. Thus asking pardon for my boldness, and Patronage for these
poor lines, I shall always rest,

Your humble servant for your Souls good, though unworthy Kinsman. THO.

TO MY NEIGHBOVRS and BRETHREN, THE MINISTERS IN THE COVNtie of Bedford and
Hertford.
Worthy Brethren,
THat which woved me to undertake this work, was not out of the least thought
of any ability in my self above others, (I speak not by way of humble pride)
but I had a challenge given me, with many a jeere and mock behind my back,
when my extreme sorrows called for better usage: The Apostles counsel is,
that we should endeavor to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of
peace; but this Diotrephes loving the preeminence has been always
undervaluing his neighbor Ministers, to set up himself: and at In the County
of Bedford.
Shefford Lecture his course has been after the Sermon to go whispering up
and down against something delivered; still finding fault with every man: yet
not daring to Non enmi dispatare amant haeretici, sed quoquo modo superare
impudentissima pervicacia, ut congregent quae non pepe rerunt. August. Tom. 6.
Contra Faustum Manichdib. 13. cap. 12. col 237.
dispute the point before the Ministers with any of them: He has to my
knowledge accused all the Lecturers in that combination for preaching Popery,
because they did press the people to Sanctity. I speak unfainedly, it has
much grieved me to hear them so falsely accused, from whom I have heard so
many excellent Sermons delivered with tender compassion and sweet expressions
to the comforting of my distressed soul, of whom I may say in the Apostles
words, God be merciful to them, for they have often refreshed me. Dear
brethren let not this Momus discourage you: God will blast his stinking breath:
and (maugre his malice) bless you with the sweet breathings of his holy
Spirit. Do but consider how the Devil does unmaske himself in moving this
man in these times, when Gods sore judgments are upon the Land to preach down
tears of repentance and Humiliation; without which you cannot read in all the
Book of God, that the Lord ever removed any one judgment from a Land, unless
it were to bring a greater in the room: Let the Scripture judge, whether it
be not our duty to preach to our people to weep; And our selves, in the
Prophet Ioels expression, to weep between the Porch and the Altar: And to say,
Spare thy people O Lord. Go on courageously, and the Lord give you his
gracious assistance in the work of your ministry; So prays

Your loving Brother and Fellow Laborer, THO. ROTHERHAM.

TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL Sr. JOHN WOLLASTON Alderman, Mr. Richard Morrell:
And the rest of my loving Parishioners of Saint John Zacharies LONDON.
Beloved in the blood of Jesus Christ,
THe Apostle tells you, 2 Pet. 2.1. That there shall be false teachers among
you, who privily shall bring in damnable Heresies: but now; some are so
impudent, they bring them in openly. Beware of such doctrine as tends to the
undervaluing of the Law of God, which the Apostle says, Romans 7.12. is holy,
just, and good: Take heed of such as go about to vilify, or rather nullify
the duties of sanctification. Consider Saint Hieroms advise, Epist. ad
Paulinum; who wished Paulinus, verba vertere in opera, to turn his words into
works; that so you may be doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving
your own souls. Saint Bernard ( de conversione ad Clericos cap. 15.) says of
good works, that they are Temporalia aeternitatis semina, seeds temporal, but
their fruit is eternal; Christ at the last will welcome none with a Well said,
but Well done good servant, enter thou into thy masters joy: If any shall
preach to you, that because you believe you need no repentance; neither to be
sorrowful in confessing your sins, nor to ask pardon: Tell them you have
not so learned Christ, who himself has taught you that as duly as you ask
for your daily bread, you should likewise ask for the forgiveness of sin;
let me warn you in the Apostles words, 2 Pet. 3.17. Ye therefore beloved,
seeing ye know these things, beware lest ye also being led away with the
error of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness: And the very God of
peace sanctify you wholly: And I pray God your whole spirit, and soul, and
body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: And so
I rest

Your careful Watchman for your souls good, who seeks not yours but you;

To my Loving Friends, and sometimes Parishioners of Ickleford, in the County
of Hertford.
Dear Friends,
I Know this Book in Answer to Master Den, was expected a year ago, and it
has been almost so long finished: But I have been hindered, by the great
distractions of the times: And my sickly and crazy body, besides other deep
sorrows which since have befalne me; As the parting with a Son of no small
hopes; And the death of my truly religious and tenderhearted Mother: of whom
I may say, as Saint Augustine of his Mother, Confess. lib. 1. cap. 11. Et
conturbata matter carnis meae, quoniam and sempiternam salutem meam charius
parturiebat: She suffered sorer pangs that I might be borne again, then She
did at my first Birth; when in sorrow she brought me forth into the world:
Witness her last dying words; which at her last farewell, at the point of her
death, she did with dear affection express, looking upon me steadfastly, and
saying: O Son, take heed how thou sinnest against God at any time: And I may
truly say of her as the same Father speaks in the first of his Confessions:
An dicam vitam mortalem, an mortem vitalem, nescio? Whether her whole life, was
a dying life, or a living death, I cannot tell: but this I can tell (to my
hearts grief) her gray hairs were brought down with sorrow to the grave.
Thus you see my hindrances, yet at last, (Post varios casus, post tot
discrimina rerum) I have here presented my answer to the Printed Sermon: And
that I undertake this work, is not out of hatred to the man, but love to the
truth, and to your souls: let me advise you in our Saviors words, to take
heed what you hear: and be not tossed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine.
He gives his book this Title: The Doctrine of John Baptist. And yet every one
may see, he does throughout his Sermon Preach down John's Doctrine; as if of
purpose he did intend to confute it: Take heed of woolves in Sheep clothing.
Aul. Gellius, lib. 2. Noct. Attic. reports, that the habit of Philosophers was
once had in great esteem: and it happened that a man infamous, clothed himself
in the habit of a Philosopher, and this man asking a gift at the hands of
Herodes Atticus one of the Consuls for the Commonwealth of Athens; he
questioned him who he was: but he with indignation answered him he was a
Philosopher, he might know him by his habit: to whom the Consul replied, I see
(says he) the face and clothing of a Philosopher, but no Philosopher: I apply
this to this Sermon. Here is Christ pretended, and Christianity, but Faith, and
Repentance, and Charity cried down, which are the inside of a Christian: And
men may pretend the Preaching of Free Grace, and Christ, and this may make a
fair show: but unless you see Faith working by love and repentance, you
cannot see a Christian, but an Antichristian. I am glad I have this love-token
to leave with you, whom I always did, and ever shall wish well: I had, while I
lived with you a trembling care for your Souls good: And I can speak it with
a safe conscience: I never willingly grieved any in the Town. If from some I
had hatred for my good will: I leave all to God, who in time will lay every
man's sin at his own door: I desire it may be in mercy to their Souls. At
my remove from you some imbittered Spirits did invenom their tongues against
me; (and yet would appear to the world as Angels of light) at whose hands I
have deserved better: I may take up the Prophets complaint; They said, Let us
smite him with the tongue, and then we will regard none of his words: And it is
the Devils policy to raise an evil report against our persons: that so he
might take away the power of our Ministry from the hearts of men that are our
hearers; but I thank God, who has wrought otherwise in the hearts of most of
my people with whom now I live, whom I desire to be followers of me, so far
forth as I am a follower of Christ: I speak not out of pride, or singularity,
in regard of my self: I thank God I have learned quietly to pass by evil
report: but in respect of my Minstery, Let my accusers be brought to my face:
if I cannot make a Christian answer, to what any man can lay to my charge, then
let me be blamed: I can truly say I have coveted no man's Silver, Gold, or
Apparel. And God knows my heart, my care has been more to enrich my self
with inward abilities for my place, than to get outward ability by my place: I
ever took more care for the state of my peoples souls, than for my outward
estate: And now Brethren, I commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace,
which is able to build you up; and to give you an inheritance among all them
which are sanctified: And thus I rest

Your true Friend, and sometimes careful Minister, THO. ROTHERHAM.

To the Assembly of Divines now sitting concerning matters of Religion, by
Order from the High Court of PARLIAMENT.
THOMAS-ATVVOOD ROTHERHAM wishes increase of Gods graces in JESUS CHRIST.
Reverend Sirs,
I Have here presented to your view, the Confutation of a Pamphlet, entitled
The Doctrine and conversation of John Baptist, wherein you have Christ and Free
Grace pretended; and yet the power of grace in the Souls of Christians
contemned, and the Kingly Office of Christ rejected, and under color of Faith
and believing, the Law of God made void, which the Apostle Romans 3.31. cries
down with an Absit: and God forbid such doctrins should be suffered, standing
so much in opposition to Scripture. Those of this Sect pretend, great
knowledge, great zeal, great holiness; so did the Pharisees in Jerusalem; the
Donatists in Afrique; the Electi amongst the Manichees: but their knowledge is
ignorance; their zeal madness; their holiness hypocrisy: Their writings,
speeches, behavior, are clear demonstrations of this: It is high time to
look unto, and to meet with such mischievous Doctrines as these: Claudenda
Cavea, antequam aves Evolaverint; the cage had need be shut, before such
unclean birds as these be flowne: God make you famous instruments for his
glory, the good of your King and Country: To the beating down of Superstition,
Heresies and Schism, and send you favor with God and man: and thus I humbly
take leave, desiring your favorable acceptance of my poor endeavors.

Et Postquam nos alma Ceres meliore beavit
Fruge: dabo vobis quam dedit illa Ceres.
A DEN OF THIEVES DISCOVERED.
IN the eleventh page of his Book: He lays down this conclusion (That John
did no Miracle; is but an opinion of the people;) I say this is his false
opinion; for it is really true that John did no Miracle: And not an opinion of
the people only: First, let us see what the Papists say, who affirm, it
cannot be, but that wheresoever the power of working Undecima nota ecclesiae
est gloria miraculorum. Bellarm. Controv. Tom. 2. c. 14.
Miracles is found, there should be the true Church. But as much as they make
of Miracles; I read not in Surius Tom. 3. June 24.
Surius (who was very careful in setting down the Miracles of the Saints) any
mention made, so much as of one Miracle that John Baptist wrought. It is clear
by Scripture that he did no Miracle, Joh. 10.41. Bellarmin in express terms
upon this place, affirms that John Etsi quanquam Ioanues ipse non secit
miracula, Bellarnan. contr. Tom. 2. cap. 14. fol. mihi 297.
wrought no Miracles: Malldonate Duplex argumentum implicat: Alterum est,
leaures nullum unquam miraculum fecit and tamen illi credidimus; multo ergo
magis huic credere debemus. Mald. in loc.
a learned Jesuit upon the Text, says, there is a double argument infolded in
the words, to move the people to believe that Christ was the true Messiah; and
the argument runs thus, First, John wrought no Miracle at any time, yet we
believed him: much more therefore ought we to believe this man who has done so
many Miracles. Secondly, All things that John foretold of this man are true,
therefore we ought to believe in him.

Jansenius Quod autem significare voluit eos dixisse Evangelisla, tale est: Si
Joanni credidimus qui nullu^ fecit signu^, multo magis huic: Jans^n. Com. in
concord. Evan. cap. 4^.
sets down the same argument with him; affirming from the Text, that John
wrought no Miracle: If we believed John who did no Miracle, much more ought we
to believe this man: Chrysostom (...): Chrysostom. hom. 60. in Joan.
backs their Exposition; setting down the same argument: Augustine Non
daemonia jugavit, non expusit sebrem non caecos illam^navir, non mortuos
suscitavit, etc. nihil horum fecit Joannes, Aug. tom. 9. Tract. 48. in Evang.
Joan. Col. mihi, 355.
concludes as much from the Text: They say (says the Father) John showed no
Miracle; He did not cast out devils, and so reckons up diverse miracles; and
concludes, John did none of these.

I have in the Marginall notes set down the Expositions of diverse Protestant
Writers, upon this Scripture, (to which I refer the learned Reader) and all
conclude, John wrought no Miracle, throughout the whole course of his
Ministry. But it is plain from the Scripture it self: Who were they that
said John did no Miracle? They were John's hearers, such as were wrought upon by
John's Ministry; such as would not have detracted any thing from John's
excellency, believers: for so the Text says, John 10.42. And many believed on
him there: so then it was the confession of believers; and certainly they
would not have spoken so gross an untruth: neither would the Spirit of God
have suffered it to be set down upon Record without reprehending of it: And
thus you see it proved as clear as the Sun [that it was not only an opinion
of the people] but that really, and in truth, John did no miracle: You may read
Mat. 11.2, 3, 4, 5. When John had heard in prison of the works of Christ, he
sent two of his Disciples, and said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or
do we look for another? Jesus answered, Go show John those things which ye
do hear and see: The Cum Salvator, corporum sanatione, externisque Symbolis,
se ad sanandas animas spiritualem venisse medicum ostensurus esset, Luc.
Brugens. in loc. Ip^a opera tanquam divina testimonia obsicit, Musculus, com.
in loc.
blind receive their sight, etc. First, What news was this to John if he
could have done the like? Secondly, or how could this have confirmed the
Disciples of John, that Christ was the true Messiah rather than John, if John
had wrought miracles? I Jesum cum Joanne conserendo, college^^nt Jesum Joanne
ma^orem and proinde Messiam esse: ^^obus in eo colligendo utuntur argumentis,
i. Joannes quidem signum nullum edidit. Volunt dicere Joannes eximius fuit
doctor, quem omnes magni fecimus, and plerique pro Messia eum habere voluerunt.
Sed nullis claruit miraculis: Hic autem doctrinam suam confirmat miraculis
stupendis qualia a nemine mortalium unquam sunt edita. Dubium est ergo nullum,
ipsum Joanne and omnibus Prophetis esse superiorem, hcut etiam Esaias id
praedixit, cap. 35. ver. 5. Chemnit. Harm. cap. 117. Ex signis colligunt
Christum long Joanne esse superiorem, cum ille nu la ministetii sut rempore
miracula ediderit: Pelargus 2. part. cap. q. 5. Colligunt Christum Joanne
praestantiorem esse, qu^a tot miraculis fuit insignis, quum Joannes nullum
miraculum edidisser. Calvin in loc. Ioannes quidem magnas and eximius fuit
doctor; sed miraculis nullis claruit, Gualter. in Evang. Joan. hom. 101.
Confessio fidelium est ex pressa, fatentur quod nullum secerit fignum. nec enim
pertinebant ad doctrinam: sed vis signorum Christo and Apostolis reservata
suit, singulari Dei consilio, Aretius in loc.
beseech you consider seriously, and compare this place with Esa. 35.4.6. He
will come and save you, Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened: Aretius, a
Protestant Writer, says; They (meaning John's hearers) confess he did no
Miracle, Qui crediderunt Ioanni Baptistae praedicanti: sed nulla miracula
sacienti. Polanus Syntagm. fol. 510.
neither did they belong to John's doctrine: But the power of working Miracles
was in the singular Counsel of God reserved for Christ and his Apostles. It
seems strange to me a man should dare so boldly to contradict so many famous
Expositors; and the Scripture it self.

In that he says he will not speak of John's miraculous Quanquam Ioannes ipse
non fecit miracula; tamen in co facta sunt multa and magna: quod natus de anu
and sterili: quod pater ejus obmutuit: postea soluta est lingua eju: in
nativitate filii; quod in u ero exultavit. Bellar. de not. ecclesiae. lib 4
cap. 14. fol. 297.
springing in the womb of his Mother, at the salutation of the Virgin Mary,
the Mother of our Lord: who so shallow as knows not? that was a miraculous
work, wrought upon John, and no miracle done by John. But to uphold his false
opinion, he propounds this question: Is it not the greatest Miracle to convert
many to God?

To this I answer, look upon the miracles set down in Scripture as done by
Christ and his Apostles; and see in the whole Catalogue whether conversion of
souls be set down as one of them: There is no Scripture to prove, that when a
Minister of the Gospel converts a soul, he works a miracle: and to speak
logically and properly, this cannot be true: It Is a Mirum and miraculum
differunt.
wonderful work; yet not a miracle. But how can he prove from John 14.12. The
works that I do, shall he do also, and greater: can he make it appear by
this place, that to covert souls, is to work miracles: for page 12. these are
his words, [ Thus John works miracles] Let us see in this place what is meant
by works: All Expositors that I read, understand two sorts of Hoc patet primo
in doctrina: secundo patet in miraculis, Lyranus in loc.

1. In Evangelii praedicatione.

2. In miraculorum operatione, Gerhard. Harm. Evang, c. 176. fol. mihi 453.


works, the one distinct from the other: First, the work of Christ's
Ministry: Secondly, his working of miracles. The one in the predication of the
Gospel, the other in the operation of miracles. So that you see the conversion
of Souls in the work of the Ministry, is distinguished from the working of
miracles; and he cannot prove from hence that John's converting of Souls to
God, was working of miracles; or miracles done by John: Learned Sed probamus

Gerhard is of opinion that Christ spoke here of those works which the
Apostles, and other believers should do in the primitive Church; both in the
preaching of the Gospel, and in the working of miracles: And that this promise
in the literal and proper sense does not belong to all believers living in all
times, but only to the Apostles, and certain other believers who lived in the
primitive time: He sets down diverse weighty reasons to prove this exposition
good, which I have set down in the Margent: (to which I refer the learned
Reader) They being not so pertinent to the matter in hand, though proper for
the exposition of the text. I may seem to digress, but give me leave to
answer one difficulty in this place: that is this: How the Apostles and other
believers in the primitive Church may be said to do greater works then Christ
did, either in the work of their ministry, or in the working of miracles.
First, They may be said to be greater, not in regard of their excellency and
original; for they were done not by their own Ut ostenderet sua eos
auctoritate, non propria ipsorum fasturos esse. Maldonat. in loc.
power and virtue, but by the power of Christ, and the plentiful effusion of
the holy Ghost which afterward they received: and our Savior intimates as
much when he says, He that believes on me, etc. They may be said to be
greater in number, numerically, greater fruits they had of their ministry:
they converted more souls in Opera majora non dignitate vel origin, cum a
Christo profluxerint in Apostolos: sed numero plura, fructu and usu. Aretius in
loc.
number then Christ: for he preached only to the Jews, Mat. 15.24. and if at
any time by the bye as it were he met with the Gentiles, he gave them only
Praedicavit rantum in Judaea; micas solummodo distribuit gentibus, quando ad
eas excursum instituit.

Christus una tantum lingua praedicavit, Syriaca scil. Apostoli per Spiritum
instructi ut in omnibus linguis Evangelium praedicarent.

Christus nondum per integrum quadriennium docendi ministerio immediate in sua
persona sunctus est, Apostoli diutius. Per praedicationem Christi pauci Judaei;
per praedicat: Apostolorum multitudo gentium. Gerhard. Harm. cap. 176 Page 453.


Crummes, Mat. 15.27. When he sent his Apostles before his passion to preach
the Gospel he gave them a special charge, Mat. 10.5. Go not into the way of
the Gentiles; but after his ascension and the sending of the holy Ghost they
were Mat. 28.19. to go and teach all Nations: Now Christ preaching in Judea
only, which was but a narrow compass in regard of the world beside, they are
said to do greater works in their Ministry then Christ did in his: The
meaning is, they converted a greater number of Souls: Christ preached only in
the Syriac tongue, but the Apostles by the gift of the Spirit in all languages,
Act. 2.4.7, 8, 9. Christ did not execute the office of his Ministry
immediately in his own person, full out four years the; Apostles had a great
deal longer time: by the preaching of Christ a few Jews only were converted
and here and there one besides; but by the preaching of the Apostles multitudes
of the Gentiles: Romans 15.18, 19. For I will not dare to speak of any of those
things which Christ has wrought by me to make the Gentiles obedient by word
and deed through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the Spirit of God,
so that from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum I have fully preached the
Gospel of Christ. Thus you see how they did greater works then Christ in
their Ministry.

How are they said to do greater miracles? I follow not some of the Ancient,
who seem to hold, that the Apostles did miracles of greater excellency, and of
a higher nature then Christ did; as Chrysostom, Lyranus, Augustine, and
others, who think it was a greater miracle for Majus est enim, ut sanet umbra,
quam fimbria Aug. in Evang. Joan. Tract. 70. in fine.
Peter, Act. 5.15. by his shadow to heal the sick, then for Christ by the
hemme of his garment to heal the woman of the bloody issue: The Apostles
preaching in more places then Christ did, had occasion to do more miracles, so
by greater miracles is meant a greater number: Pardon this digression.

To return to the matter in hand, page 12. he says upon Joh. 14.12. What are
these greater things but the conversion of the peoples: And the plentiful gift
of the holy Ghost through their preaching?

answer, as before, by greater works is not meant only the gift of preaching,
but the gift of working miracles, which is a gift distinguished from preaching,
as the Apostle proves, 1 Cor. 12.4. Now there are diversity of gifts, but the
same Spirit, ver. 10. To another the working of miracles. To clear all, If the
conversion of souls by the Ministry of the word were the gift of miracles;
then the power of working miracles in the Church should never cease: but that
is already ceased, and now taken away: being necessary only at the first
planting of the Gospel: but the Gospel being already planted, they are not
now necessary, and therefore miracles now cease.

In the latter end of the 12. page he confesses Moses his office was glorious:
but page 13. he has these expressions, Let Saint Paul speak more plain, 2
Cor. 3.9. If the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more shall the
Ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. From this place he concludes
that Moses is the Minister of condemnation, John of Righteousness; Moses of
death, John of life. He is beside the particular intent of this Scripture: That
which the Apostle aims at, is not to compare John's Ministry and Moses
together, but his own Ministry with his adversaries, as I shall show at large
when I come to expound the place. Let me ask one question, Was not God the
Author of that, which Moses was the Minister? no man can deny it; but lest I
should be thought too captious, let me show you how the want of the true
interpretation of this chapter, and the right meaning of the Apostle has been
the occasion of great Haeresie. There was an Haeretique thirteen hundred
years ago called Manes Co^veniunt rebus nomina saepe suis.

; Saint Augustine calls him Manichaeus: He did reject the old Testament: I
tremble to write down what he said concerning the Prophets.

Magdeburgenses set down this as one of Manichaeus his errors: that he did
hold and affirm the Testament of the law (by which he means the Old
Testament) to be the Testament of death, or condemnation; and he labored to
maintain his Haeresie, from this Scripture which he alleges, to prove Moses
to be the Minister of death: to wit, this which now we are upon; namely, 2 Cor.
3.7. If the ministration of death, etc. This Haeretique does likewise affirm,
That he which spoke with Moses, the people of the Jews, and the Priests in the
Old Testament, was the Prince of darkness: And what does he differ, in making
Moses the Minister of death, and so of darkness? He likewise did hold this
damnable opinion, that there was one God of the Old Testament, another of the
New; and that the Old and New are contrary the one to the other: Men must take
heed how they handle a point of so high a Nature so rawly; as I am sure he did
when he preached.

Now let us see the scope of the Apostle in this chapter, 2 Cor. 3.9. The
Apostle had to do with Impostores perst^^ngit qui cum legis doctrinam
importunius urgerent se non novi, sedpotius veteris restamenti ministros esse
declarabant; idque non sine ignominia Christi qui umbras istas abolere debuit.
Gualter. in I. Epist. ad Cor. hom. 12.
false teachers, who were exceeding earnest in pressing the doctrine of the
Law, and that in opposition, and to the undervaluing of Jesus Christ, by whose
coming those shadows were and ought to be abolished and given over: So that
the opposition stands between Paul's doctrine and the doctrine of his
adversaries, the false Apostles.

Let us see first, 2 Cor. 3.6. how the Law is called the letter, and so
kills, and how it is the ministration of death and condemnation. The Apostle
does often use the word letter in opposition to the word Spirit, because that
which is called the Law of Moses, was written Exodus 31.18. in Tables of stone
with the finger of God: to wit, the Decalogue, and therefore called the letter
Optima fuit ratio cur lex d^ceretur (...) per antonomasiam; quod rectius
converreris scriptum quam literam. and tamen volumus ex more [literam]
interpretari. Beza. Annota^. in Epistad Romans cap 2. ver. 27.
. But the Apostle looks at somewhat more: for because not only the
Ceremonial Law, but also the Moral (which we call the Ten Commandments)
did lead to Christ who is every way made Righteousness unto true believers;
this use of the law many of the people of the Jews partly through ignorance,
and partly through obstinacy did contemn. From whence it comes to pass that
the Apostle speaking concerning the law, only from the Modo ex Judaeorum
hypothesi. Beza. in loc.
supposition of the Jews, who did apply the Law to themselves, considered
severally, and apart and separated from Christ: And from hence the Apostle
calls it the letter: and so the naked Law by it self, separated from Christ,
is in Scripture called the letter, which is nothing profitable to salvation.
(and this comes to pass through the corruption of man's nature) Sometimes this
opposition between the letter and the Spirit, has respect in particular to
the Ceremonial Law: Then the Apostle calls it the letter Tunc Paulus (...)
vocat externum signum ab ipsius signi fine sive a virtute sejunctum, quam vocat
Spiritum. Beza.
when the outward sign is considered apart from the thing signified, then it
is a dead thing; unprofitable, and of no use. For what is the shadow without
the body?

Who knows not? but that in disputation many things are laid down under some
condition, which otherwise cannot be affirmed? The Apostle in this chapter is
in a dispute in which he lays down the difference between the Ministry of
the Law, and of the Gospel, by comparing Effert suam doctrinam contra
calumniatorum doctrinam, and Argumentum sumit a co^paratis. Areti. in loc.
the one with the other, as they were by Paul's adversaries (the false teachers)
set in opposition the one against the other, who holding to the bare letter of
the law, did preach justification by the works of the Law without Jesus
Christ, in opposition to the Gospel, so that Moses is called the Minister of
death Abusive.
Abusively: Because these false teachers did abuse the law of Moses in resting
upon it according to the literal sense; and so by excluding Christ, who is the
Men's egis est Christus lex in lapidibus insculpta suit: ideoque literal^^ erat
doctrina hic legis desectus corrigendus suit per Evangelium: quia fragilem esse
oportuit; quamdiu rabulis lapideis tanrum erat consignata. Calvin. in loc.
life of the Law; make it to be to themselves (by their false interpretation
and misapplication) a dead letter; and so it is, so long as it is written in
tables of stone only, and not in the tables of our hearts.

Now let us see how the Law is said to be the ministration of condemnation, as
the Apostle calls it, 2 Cor. 3.9. It is called so accidentally Accidenter
Dyonys. Carthus. in loc.
as is plain, Romans 7.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. For sin taking Non dicit, occasion
autem data, quoniam lex non dat occasionem pecandi, sed dicir occasion
accepta. Cajeta. romans 5 in loc.
occasion by the Commandment deceived me, and by it slew me: in this chapter
it is plain that the law is the ministration of death by accident, not
causally, but occasionally. The occasion is not given by the Commandment, but
taken through the corruption of man's nature: for the mind of man endeavoring
to maintain its own liberty in sinning; cannot endure to be kept in by the
Commandment, and restrained, and so sins the more eagerly, according to the
Proverb, Nitimur in vetitum: we are exceeding earnest to do that which is
forbidden us, (such is our corruption) the more ready we are to run into it: So
likewise the Gospel may be said to be the ministration of condemnation
occasionally, Luke 2.34. Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising
again of many in Israel, 1 Pet. 2.8. A stone of stumbling; a Rock of offense.
No fault in Christ or the Gospel, whose proper office is, to build us up to be
spiritual Temples for God to dwell in; The fault is in man, who through the
corruption that is in him, takes occasion to stumble at this stone; It Is
accidental Quum nobis in sundamentum datus sit, illiac. identale esse Petram
Scandali. Calv. in loc.
to Christ, to be a Rock of offense: But it being accidental as well to the
Law, as to the Gospel, to be the Ministry of death, wherein lies the
difference? There is a wide difference, It is a perpetual and inseparable
accident in regard of the Law: not so in regard of the Gospel. But to wind up
this bottom: If by Moses we understand the writings of Scripta M^sis sunt
ipsum ve^us Testamonrum: adjunctis prophetis. Cajetan.
Moses; which are the Old Testament together with the Prophets, that is to say,
Moses and the Prophets, the Prophets were extraordinary Ministers of the Old
Testament, ordained for the Instruction of the Church, by interpreting and
applying the Law: and foreshewing the sufferings, and glory of Christ, Act.
3.24. Yea and all the Prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after, as
many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days; That is, of the
days of the Messiah; of those things, which in these days are fulfilled by
Jesus Christ; The days Quae his temporibus per Jesus Christum impleta sunt,
Brentius in Act. Apost. hom. 15.
of Christ's Flesh, so the Apostle calls them, Heb. 5.7. Who in the days of his
Flesh; All the Prophets did declare one and the same Christ to come in the
flesh. And the Apostle confirms this Facit hoc ad Evangelii commendationem,
and confirmatione^, quod jam olim a Deo per prophetas ab ipso inspiratos,
quorum oracula litetis consignata haberentur, promissum esset; ne videretur res
nova and commentitia, Estius, Com. in loc.
Romans 1.1, 2, 3. Paul a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an Apostle,
separated unto the Gospel of God, which he had promised before by his holy
Prophets in the holy Scriptures concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord; which
was made of the seed of David, according to the flesh. The Apostle uses these
words to prove that the Doctrine of the Gospel, was not a new Occupatio est qua
declinat invidiam novitatis: nam Evangelium putabatur doctrina recens, Pet.
Martyr. Com. in loc.

Ut Novitatis depelleret invidia^, seque non novarum retu^ praedicatorem; and
Apostolum ostenderet, Evangeliumque ab antiquitate commendaret, Tolet. in loc.


Doctrine: Some of Paul's hearers reasoned thus with themselves. The ancient
Patriarchs and Prophets were saved, and had the true Church of God amongst
them: and yet they wanted your Gospel. Therefore, the Doctrine of the Gospel
is not necessary; but superfluous. Here the Apostle confesses those in the old
Testament were saved, but not without the Gospel. And so convinces them, that
the Preaching of the Gospel was no innovation, seeing it was preached
throughout the whole Church of God in the old Testament: And as Theophylact
observes, the word Gospel, was used in David's time, Psalm 68. ver. 11. The
Lord gave the word, great was the company of those that published it. What did
they publish? Why, the Gospel: ((...)) (...), Theophylact. Chrysostom. ad Roman
hom 1. Evangelizantibus, Hieron.
Preachers of the Gospel: the Gospel was then preached plentifully: for great
was the company of Preachers: and the Septuagint, Chrysostom, and St. Hierom
agree with Theophylact: And Scriptures agree, First, that from Singulis illis
temporibus Evangelicam promissionem de semine mulicris repetitam; and subinde
clarius Expositam esse dicit, Chemn. lccor. part. 2. page 579.
the fall of Adam to the Flood: Secondly, from the Flood to Moses: Thirdly,
from Moses to the Prophets: Fourthly, from the Prophets to Christ: The Gospel
and the promises of it, were made known: And applied by believers: in all
several ages, to their everlasting Salvation, by Jesus Christ, in whom they
believed.

Theophylact proves the word Gospel to be used in the old Testament from Isay
52.7. How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that brings
[good tidings!] That is, the Gospel; for so the word signifies (...)
Septuagint
; And the Apostle alleging this place of the Prophet, Romans 15.10. Paulus de
Evangelica prae. dicatione haec verba affert. Marian. Schol.
expounds it to be the Preaching of the Gospel: How beautiful are the feet
of them that preach the Gospel of Peace! The same Gospel (according as he
distinguishes the time in his Book, page 19.) was preached from Moses to John
Baptist, yea, the very same which the Apostles preached.

conclude, if by the Law we understand the Doctrine of Moses, and the Prophets;
the benefit of Gods free grace is in no wise to be separated from the Law. For
the grace of God concerning the free remission of sins for Christ's sake the
Mediator, was Preached as well in the Old Testament as in the New: by which no
less in the time of the Old Testament, than in the time of the New, all the
Saints were justified and saved, as is fully confirmed, Act. 15.11. But we
believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved
[even as they,] That is, even as our Fathers; who lived in the time of the old
Testament: Therefore, there was one and the same Gospel, teaching that the

Apost. hom. 102. in fine.
grace and favor of God is to be looked for in Christ the Mediator; in whom
all the Saints in all times from the beginning of the world, were and are
justified and saved. I ask this question: Did Moses ever go about to Preach
Justification by the works of the Law; Neither did God ever make any Covenant
of works with man since the Fall: Well then, consider Moses not abusively, and
the Law of Moses, not mis-interpreted, and misapplyed, by false teachers and
wicked men. And by the Law understand the Doctrine of Moses: and so Moses was
the Minister of life, and the Law the Ministration of Salvation: This is
plain, Act. 15.21. For Moses of old has in every City them that Preach him,
being read in the Synagogue every Sabbath day; And no question but by the
blessing of God upon it, many thousand souls were converted to God by that
Preaching. Else would not our Savior in the Parable, Sententia haec

Luke 16.29.31. have laid it down as a thing so necessary to hear Moses and
the Prophets, had not their Doctrine, by the power of God accompanying it,
been effectual to the conversion of Souls. I have been the larger, because
such preaching as this, does with the error of the Manichees, cast a blemish
upon the old Testament, and makes way to that false Doctrine, which afterward
he preached, and has Printed in his Book.

Whereas Page 22. He that shall search into the most material Controversies,
between the Protestant and the Papist, he shall find the error of the Papist,
chiefly to arise from hence: The want of Distinction between Law and Gospel.
Sure this is that which makes him to cavil, and differ from other Ministers, if
any Ministers in their Sermons, do (but as they are bound) press the duties
of sanctification: he presently cries out to his injudicious applauders, they
Preach flat Popery: Nay, though they use the same exhortations the Scripture
does, in the selfsame words, we must not Preach to our people as Peter did, 2
Pet. 3.11. Seeing all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons
ought ye to be, in all holy conversation and godliness? If we preach the
terrors of God; then we are legal preachers: If we press them to duties and
a holy life, then we Preach Popery: And yet thus Christ and his Apostles
Preached: Whereas, if he were not wilfully ignorant; and like the deaf Adder
stop his ears, he might hear Ministers cry down all merit, and popery, even
when they are a pressing them to holy duties; showing them, that nothing can
stand between the Meritum Christi unicum est pretium redemptionis nostrae, quo
solo a peccato and morte aeterna redimimur, and Deo reconciliati, in filios,
and haeredes vitae aeternae adoptamur, Cassand. consultat. page mihi 968.
wrath of God, and a poor Creature, but the merit of Christ alone: confessing
all our righteousness to be as a polluted cloth: Do I speak of confessing?
He will have none of that; no confession of sin; when we press men to pray,
we do not persuade them they shall merit eternal life by prayer, neither do
we wish them to rest in the duty done, but wholly upon the merits of Christ:
Neither do we think that Christ does infuse his Nec ita intelligendum est quod
Christus infundat meritum suum nostrae orationi, ut ipsa sit placatio coelestis
irae and expiatio pro peccatis, sed quia exerit sese per preces; intuetur
promissiones Dei, quibus roboratur and confirmatur apprehendir Christum propter
quem solum Deus nobis in vocantibus est propitius: and quia Deus invenir in
nobis Christum per fidem, ideo in nos ipsum invocantes essundit omne genus
beneficiorum, non propter invocationis meritum, sed propter Christi meritum,
Gerbard, locor. tom 3. Col. mihi 368.
merit into our prayer that it should become the pacification of the wrath of
God, or an expiation for our sins: but because faith does manifest it self
by prayer, does behold the promises of God, with which it is strengthened and
confirmed, and it does apprehend Christ, for whose sake alone God is merciful
to us, when we call upon him. And because God finds Christ in us by Faith,
therefore when we pray to him, he does bestow upon us every good thing; not for
the merit of our prayer, but for the merit of Christ. Let men take heed lest
under the color of Preaching free Grace, they do not turn the grace of God
into wantonness: and give men such a liberty to live as they lust; which is
indeed the greatest bondage: let them take heed, lest while they pretend to
advance the Kingdom of Christ, they do not overthrow his Kingly Office, and
pluck, as much as in them lies, the Crown from off his head. If Christ be a
King, certain his Subjects must yield obedience to him: And we his Ministers
must preach obedience to them: Could not the Apostle distinguish between Law
and Gospel? and do we preach popery, when in our Sermons we follow the rule
of the Apostle, Romans 2.6, 7. and tell the people; God will render to every man
according to his deeds. To them who by patient continuance in well-doing, seek
for glory, and honor, immortality, eternal life, ver. 10. Glory, honor and
peace to every one that works: The Apostle does not say, God will render to
every man [for] his deeds: that so he may exclude merit; in regard of our best
performances: but [according] to his deeds: that so he may extol free grace.
That Quod Deus aeterna gloria, and felicitate eos donare vult, qui ex fide been
operati sunt, id nihil gratuitae justificationi nostrae derogat: justificamur
enim gratis fide; deinde ex fide, bona, and Deo placentia opera facimus, Osian.
in loc.
God will bestow glory and eternal life upon those who by faith continue in
well-doing: that derogates nothing from our free justification: and being
justified gratis, or freely through Faith: Then by Faith we do good works
pleasing to God: Consider these two places, first, Ephesians. 2.8. For by grace ye
are saved through Faith; and that not of your selves, it is the gift of God.

Whereas page 22. he wishes us to look into the most material controversies
between the Papists and us, I do not think he is much seen into them: for I
did hear him peremptorily affirm that the Council of Trent did hold Bishops

not to be (Jure Divino) by divine right: being asked what Session and Canon,
could not tell, and afterward confessed he had not read it in the Council of
Trent; and indeed the Council is clean contrary in extolling Bishops.

In the 23. page of his book he says, There is this day a complaint in our
Country, that our Sermons are full of contradictions: the Multitude observe
them, and grievously complain of them: and this is not the complaint of
unlettered men. What a lewd slander is this laid upon all the Ministers? And
whom does he bring to proveit? The Vulgus, (...), Graece, usurpatur a Latinis

venere, pro illo qui certae mulieris amore non capitur, sed popularem venerem
sectaturus.
Multitude: It wonder where this multitude is: but grant it were so, it is a
credit to have such accusers: The multitude called the vulgar, from volving,
rolling, or tumbling, in constant, unsettled, foolishly carried about this way,
and that way, with every wind of Doctrine.

But how comes the Multitude to understand what the word Contradictoria sunt,
quae affirmationi and negationi subjacent: Duplex contradictionis genus
Simplicis and complexae.
[Contradiction] means, how come they to be so cloquent? how come they by so
much Logic? I dare say if they be examined they cannot render the
signification of the word: whether it be in the praedicaments or
post-praedicaments, they understand not: surely if they did, they would not so
grossly belly their Ministers. The multitude laid many grievous complaints
against Paul which they could not prove, Act. 25.7. It argues a great deal of
indiscretion, if not of pride, and arrogance, and selfe-conceitednesse, for a
man to cast such an aspersion to the blasting of so many godly Ministers, and
the extolling of himself, especially at a visitation Sermon, where he
pretended to preach Christ, but did altogether preach himself, as is plain by
his own expressions, If we do bid the Letany farewell, yet for once upon such
a special occasion as this, Let me say from pride, vain glory, and
hypocrisy, good Lord deliver us.

In the latter end of page 23. and the beginning of the 24. he has this
passage: It was Prophesied by Luther that after his time the difference
between the Law and the Gospel should be neglected: Our age has proved him
to be too true a Prophet, for it is a thing not ordinarily observed: The fault
is; the Law is not rightly applied: As when we apply it to troubled Consciences
to give satisfaction. This is a mere false invention of his own, He dares not
challenge any one Minister for this, if he should, he would withstand him to
his face, and prove him false. The Apostle, 2 Timothy 2.14. Contentiosa hujusinodi
disputatio non modo nullam afferr utilitate^, sed detr^menti plurimum, non
aedificat, sed destruit auditores minus veritate^ penetrantes; putantenim
plerumque sunplices qui assistunt, magis loquaces, magisque clamosos, magis
esse sapientes, and intelligentes, Espencaeus, in loc.
charge that we strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of
the hearers: I am sure he does a great deal of wrong to some poor ignorant
people, who discern not the truth, but are ready to think him to be the most
able man that can word it most, and set up his own credit by disgracing
others, but this is an unsound foundation to build upon; for not he that
commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends, 2 Cor. 10.18. Is
any Minister that has the charge of Souls upon him (especially in these
knowing times) so grossly ignorant, that when he sees a man in distress of
conscience, through the apprehension of the wrath of God due to him for his
sins, to apply the terrors of the Law, to comfort him; And when we hear men
that are troubled in their consciences; to cry out of their unworthiness; and
of the great imperfections which accompany their best actions: saying as it is
Agnoscen da estgrati^, sed non ignoranda natura, Ambr. Com. in Evang. Luc. lib.
8. c. 17.
Luke 17.10. We are unprofitable Servants: Now in this case, is any Minister
so shallow or unworthy as to apply the Law to give satisfaction? This were to
deal as cruelly as the bloody Soldiers did with Christ in his extremity who
gave him gall and vinegar to drink, Mat. 27.34. The Elders Scribitur in libro
quodam Hebraico qui, a pud eos intitulatur liber judicum ordinatiorum, quon iam
Solomon dixerat Proverb. 31.6. Ideo ex occasion hujus vetbi, Senio^es
Judaeorum natuerant ut condemnatis ad more^m daretur vin^m aromaticum ad
b^bendam, it facilius tolerarent passionem: In Jerusalem autem erant Matronae
devotae, and compassi^ae, quae ho^v^n^m dabant ex devotione: Ju laei eigo ex
nimia crudelltate moti tale vinum datum pro Christo, and allis duobas cum eo
crucifi^^, acceperuntfibi, secundum quod dict. (...), Amos. 2. and loco e^ns.
posuerunt acctum cum fell mixtum, Lyrau, p 5 fol. nuhi. 85.
among the Jews (from that of Solomon, Prove. 31.6. Give strong drink unto him
that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of a heavy heart.) made a
Statute that those who were condemned to dye, should have wine given them to
drink in their sufferings, (the death of the Cross being most bitter) mixed
with comfortable and sweet spices; that they might in the time of their
extremity, more easily undergo their pains: I have read that in Jerusalem
there were certain devoute Matrons, who out of compassion, did at their own
charges provide this wine for those that were to be crucified: Now the
Soldiers moved with bloody cruelty drank that Aromaticall wine whith was
provided for our Lord, in the time of his suffering, according to that of Amos
2.8. They drink the wine of the Condemned, and in stead thereof gave him gall
and vinegar to drink. O bloody cruelty! no less cruel is that Minister that
does apply the law separated, and in opposition to the promises of the Gospel;
to give satisfaction to a troubled conscience.

The Apostle, 2 Timothy 2.15. lays this charge upon a Minister, to study to show
himself approved a workman that need not be ashamed: It Is one thing to Preach,
another to be a workman in Preaching: I speak not against much, and often
Preaching, I honor it with my heart, but such as are longer in Preaching of a
Sermon, then in studying of it, more frequent and longer time in the Pulpit
then in their study; they are not workmen, not laborers, but loiterers, to
whom woe belongs for doing the work of the Lord negligently. What is it for a
man to give his Servants three meals a day, and set nothing but bones, husks,
and shells before them; when men come up into the Pulpit without
praemeditation, they do but vent their own Ex Tempore frothy expressions: And
this is not preaching; but to lavish out the precious time of grace: And this
is the cause of so many fond, new upstart opinions. Preaching is no such easy
work, what ever ignorant men think, Who is sufficient for these things? 2
Cor. 2.16. Not Cobblers, and Tradesmen, who to the dishonor of God and the
ruin of this Nation, pollute Gods Ordinances: And would if they could, trample
Gods faithful Ministers under foot; and this flows from a little, ungrounded,
smattering knowledge they have gotten: we must study to be workmen that need
not be ashamed; rightly (...), Beza.
dividing the word of truth; rightly cutting the word of Truth: There is a
four foldexposition of this place.

First, that it is a Metaphor taken from a sword or sharp instrument wherewith
things unprofitable, superfluous and corrupt are cut off: as the dead member
from the living: Ministers must be able to distinguish between the living and
the dead, and in their Sermons to divide the one from the other.

Secondly, a Metaphor taken from husbandmen who cut straight furrows, or
rather from men that are sawers of Timber who cut by a line, not declining to
the right hand or to the left, but keeping to the rule: so must the Ministers
of God do.

Thirdly, from the Master of a Family that cuts bread for his children: and
distributes to every one as he sees need.

Fourthly, from the Priests in the old Testament, whose office was to cut the
Sacrifices, and to divide; certain pieces, were to be offered to God in
Sacrifice; certain to be for the Priest. All these expositions are good: and
we learn from hence, that it is the duty of every Minister according as his
Juxta singulotum (ut cu^ glossa interlineati loquar) co^petentiam and secundum
uniuscujusque qualitatem, Espencaeus in loc.
hearers are, to instruct, exhort, rebuke, comfort. But how miserably is the
word of God mangled by a company of unlettered, unskilful Laics, who never
had authority either from God or man; neither ability; to take upon them, so
high and sacred an office!

We must distribute the word to every one according to their capacity, to Babes
milk, to men of riper years stronger meat; Taking heed how we give holy
things to dogs, or cast pearls among Swine: our Sermons being like David's
song of Mercy and Judgment, lest that complaint come against us, Deus non
territat suos rebus inanibus: sed legis praedicatione, co^minationeque paenarum
a peccaris little deterret, paenitentibus remissionem peccatorum promittit:
Ludovic. Lavat. in Ezekiel. hom. 47.
Ezekiel. 13.22. Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad,
whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he
should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life. Judgment must
be applied to whom it belongs, and mercy to whom mercy belongs.

Lucas Pollo a German divine, a man of eminent parts, was wont to preach the
law exceeding earnestly; inveighing against the common sins of the times in
which he lived very ^^arpely, That he left a sting in the consciences and
minds of men: insomuch that sparing none he gave offense to some, which he
regarded not: having Gods command, and the examples of the Prophets, and
Apostles, to back him: Again he Preached the Gospel most sweetly, laboring
to lift up such as were cast down, and sensible of the wrath of God due to
them for their sins, and to bring them to the hope of Gods free grace, and
Eternal salvation: And in his last sickness he desired, that when he should
be in an Agony and lie a dying to be put in mind of four things.

First, of Consolations concerning the remission of sins.

Secondly, of Consolations concerning Gods gracious presence in afflictions and
death it self.

Thirdly, concerning final conservation, that God will conserve and keep his
elect against sin, death, Satan, and hell, to Eternal life.

Fourthly, of those words of Christ; The Righteous shall go into life
Eternal. And did tell the Minister to whom he had committed this charge: that
in doing thus he should execute the office of a true Pastor. And is not this
the care of all Gods faithful Ministers? who have had experience of the work
of God upon their own consciences: Quis infirmatur non aegritudine corporls
sedanimi, qualitatem cu^ae suaedeseribit ab effectibus internis, Cajetan in
loc. Quis infirmatur in fide, and ego non infirmor. Si enim aliquem in fide

vix subsistere queat ita ego certe afficior, ac si ipse eas tentationes
sustinerem: neque conquiescere possum, donce tales iterum erigam, and
confirme^, Luc. Osiard. in loc.
2 Cor. 5.11. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men: And
when we see men in distress of Conscience, may we not say with the Apostle:
Who is weak and I am not weak? 2 Cor. 11.29. Who is offended, and I burn not?
I know there are in these parts of the Country many able Preachers, who in
their Sermons do rightly and truly distinguish between Law and Gospel: to
the beating down of the Kingdom of Satan, and setting up the Kingdom of
Jesus Christ in their several Parishes: whose bowels do yearne over the
souls of their people. Witness their constant, pious, and painful Preaching
in such times, when Preaching was most opposed: whose tender bleeding
Consciences, having a hand of Iron held over them, could not swallow down that
which this man did: although their lively-hoods and liberties lay at Stake,
being threatened with suspension, deprivation, imprisonment: witness the
reading of the book of Liberties, and other innovations which he yielded to
without making question: nay pleaded for them: let him not go about to cast
dirt in their faces, whose upright conversation, and dear affection, they
express: to the Souls committed to their charge, makes them lovely, and
honorable in the sight of God, and all that truly fear God.

In the beginning of page 27. This question is propounded: Did not Moses preach
grace? The answer is No, Moses preaches the law of works. This is answered
before, only I propound two questions. First, whether did Moses ever preach
justification by the works of the Law? in plain terms: whether did he ever
lay this down for a doctrine; That a man may be justified by the works of the
Law in the sight of God? Moses did preach the righteousness of faith, and so
he did preach grace. Secondly, Whether is not the Foedus gratiae afferens; and
applicans remissionem peccatorum, justitiam and vitam aetema^, omnibus in
Christum mediatore^ credentibus, ed perpetuum, aeternum ac immutabile, omnibus
mundi temporibus unum arque ide^, nulli abrogationi obnoxium; omne^ verustatis

to^. 3. col. mihi. 292.
Covenant of grace one and the same? preached in all ages, by which all
believers, have been, are and shall be saved? but we shall speak more fully
of this hereafter.

I come to the next question propounded, page 27. Did not Moses speak truth?
In the Pulpit he made this Answer: that he did speak the truth, and he did not
speak the truth. I meeting him on the morrow by accident, told him that Moses
was to be commended in that he spoke the truth: but he was blame worthy in that
he did not speak the truth: he made no answer for the present: but writes to
me afterward (Nimirum tacuisse) that he did conceal the truth: And so makes
him guilty of that which the Apostle pleads for his discharge, Act. 20.27. I
have not shunned to declare unto you all the Counsel of God. And how it can
stand with Heb. 3.5. Summa vero est, Mosen scilicet fideliter tradi disse
populo quae illi Dominus mandaverat, Calvin in loc.
And Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a Testimony
of those things which were to be spoken after: Moses did deliver all things
which were commanded him of God, faithfully; to the people for a Testimony of
those things which were to be spoken: these words are truly to be understood
of the Gospel of Christ, of which Moses was a witness: so that here is set
down the Sic consensus doctrinae M^sis atque Apostoli, in hac Epistola ex
plicatae, non obs^^^e explicabitur, Paraeus in loc.
Agreement between the doctrine of Moses and the Apostle expressed in this
Epistle: so that they were both witnesses of one and the same Christ, of one
and the same Gospel, and did Preach one and the same Doctrine: Certainly,
then Moses did not hold his peace concerning any Truth, he was to deliver from
God to the people. But in Print he sets down this answer to the question, [Did
not Moses speak Truth? yes, according to Law and Conscience: But not according
as the Truth is, and was, in Christ.] Let us see how he could speak the truth
according to Law and Conscience, but not according as the truth is, and was in
Christ Jesus: look upon the Scripture spoken by way of anticipation in the end
of page 26. John. 1.17. The Law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by
Jesus Christ. And he setting down the opposition, concludes, That Moses did
not Preach Grace: Look into the true sense and meaning of that place, and you
shall see that from thence, to say in general terms, Moses did not preach
Grace, is false Doctrine: And if we can prove he did preach Grace, we make it
plain: for to say he did, and he did not, one of these must of necessity be
false: The Proposition being laid down absolutely without condition, as his
is: Let us take his advise and mark the opposition in this place.

The Est prolepsis in qua praevenit contratia^ exceptione^: tanti enim erat
apud Judaeos Moses, ut aegre quicqua^, ab eo diversum admittere^t: docet ergo
Evangelista quantu^ inferius fuit Mosis ministeriu^ Christi potesta^e unde
sequitur, si legem a Christo; separes, nihil restare praeter inanes figuras,
Calvin in loc.
Evangelist speaks by way of prevention, of what exception might be made to
the contrary: the Jews had such a high esteem of Moses, that they could
hardly admit of any thing different from him; holding themselves to the bare
Letter of the Law, in opposition to Christ: The Evangelist therefore puts them
in mind, how little Moses does benefit, compared in opposition with the Grace
that comes by Jesus Christ: and how the Law does avail nothing without Christ,
but is an obstacle and hinderance from obtaining the grace of God: They had
always Moses in their mouth, and did boast of his authority against Christ, so
that here his Ministry, and the benefit we have by Christ (according to their
misconstruction) are set in opposition the one to the other.

For the further clearing of this place, [the Non hoc accipiendum est
exclusive, quasi solam legem Moses docuerit: sed Antithesis insti uitur inter
ministerium Mosis, and beneficium Christi: Distinguendum igitur inter Mosen
doctorem and Legislatorem five pacti legalis Mediatorem Moses, ut doctor de
Christo praedicavit and scripsit, Gerhard locor. Tom. 3. Col mihi. 231.
Law came by Moses, but Grace and Truth by Jesus Christ] this is not to be
taken exclusively: as though Moses did teach the Law only: we must distinguish
between him as he was a Doctor, and Teacher: and as he was a Lawgiver, and
Mediator of the legal Covenant, but setting aside the opposition which is
made in Scripture, betwixt Moses and Christ, which comes to pass in regard of
the Adversaries, who did extol him to the end they might oppose the Grace
which comes by Jesus Christ. Consider Moses as a Teacher of Gods People, and so
he did preach Grace and Truth to all believers by Jesus Christ, and this is
proved, Job. 1.45. We have found him of whom Moses did write in the Law, and
the Prophets, In venimus Jesum, quasi dicat, hoc nomen congruam est prophetis,
quoniam promittunt Messiam salvatorem, Lyran. in loc.
Jesus of Nazareth: and thus it is false Doctrine for him to teach that Moses
did not preach grace.

Truth Veritas hoc loco non opponitur falsitati, neque enim falsitas fuit lex
Mosaica, sed opponitur, 1. Legi monstranti quidem viam justitiae; non autem
praebenti vires and facultatem: atque ita significat veritas, restaurationem
naturae, hoc est, renovationem mentis, and novitatem vitae, quam Christus per
Spiritum Sanctum operatur, atque ita usurpatur vocabulum illud, Ephesians. 4.21.
in this place, is not to be understood in opposition to falsehood, neither was
there any falsehood in the Law of Moses, but it is opposed; First, To the Law,
showing us indeed the way of Righteousness, but not giving strength and
ability to keep it. So that Truth signifies the restoration of our nature:
that is, the renewing of our mind, and newness of life, which is wrought in
us by the Holy Ghost, as the Apostle makes it plain, Ephesians. 4.21, 22. As the
Truth is in Jesus, that ye put off concerning the former Secundo opponitur
umbris, and figuris, quod scilicet Evangelium illa exhibeat, quae lex per
umbras figurav^^, Chemn. Harm ca. 20. col. mihi. 218.
conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts,
and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; And that ye put on the new man.
Secondly, Truth is opposed to shadows and figures; to wit, that the Gospel
should exhibit those things which the Law set forth in shadows: So that
Christ by his coming in the flesh, fulfilling those things which the Law
foretold, and did foreshew in shadows, and figures, [concerning him] has
manifested, that to be true which the Law foretold: and is the substance of
those shadows: And thus Truth is said to come by Jesus Christ.

Whereas he says: Moses spoke the Truth according to Law and Conscience, but
not according as the Truth is and was in Christ Jesus: (He shows himself in
this, to be a man void both of Science, and Conscience) if he did speak the
truth according to Law, is not Christ the truth, the Law pointed at, and set
forth? (may I not say) is not Christ the truth of the law? Gal. 3.24. The Law
was our Schoolmasters to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by
Faith. The precepts of the Law did convince the people of unrighteousness:
because they showed how far they came short of that obedience the law
required, and so they were put in mind to seek for righteousness elsewhere.
The legal promises did propound life upon condition of perfect obedience. He
that does these things shall live in them: but the Fathers seeing it impossible
for them to perform this condition, were thereby put in mind to seek for
Righteousness out of themselves: namely in Christ: The whole Law was a
Schoolmasters leading those in the Old Testament by the hand to Christ. As
there was a Cum triplex lex suerit, triplex paedagogica disciplina fuit.

1 Moralis ducebat ad Christum accidentali directione.

2. Lex ceremonialisdirecta significatione; and duratione.

3. Forensis seu politia, distinctione gent is a reliquis populis, and
duratione. ad Christum usque, Parcus, Com. in. loc.


Threefold Law, so a Threefold Paedagogicall discipline.

First, the Moral Law did lead to Christ by Accidental direction.

Secondly, the Ceremonial by direct signification and duration; the Ceremonies
did shadow forth Christ, and were to end at his coming.

Thirdly, the judicial Law or polity by distinguishing the Nation of the Jews
from other people and continuing unto Christ.

Thus Christ being the truth and substance of the Law, Moses speaking truth
according to Law, spoke the truth as it was in Christ Jesus, who was ever to
all believers as it is, Joh. 14.6. The way, the truth, and the life; No man
comes to the Father but by me: Moses could never come to the Father but by
this way and this truth: it is blasphemy therefore to say he did not speak
according as the truth was in Christ Jesus, who was ever that one truth in all
ages of the world to all the people of God. Again had not Moses a Conscience
sprinkled with the blood of Christ? and did he not in Christ apprehend Gods
reconciled face to him, in the full pardon and free remission of all his
sins? Why then, if Moses spoke truth according to conscience, shadowing forth
the blood of Christ by the blood of Bulls and Goats to be that which did
sprinkle the Conscience from dead works to serve the living God: it must needs
be that he spoke the truth as it is in Christ Jesus: Christ being ever the
same in all Ages to the Consciences of all believers: and certainly Moses
spoke nothing but what did accord with the truth as it was and is in Christ
Jesus, he being always that same Truth: But to prove this, page 27. he says,
this was the hidden mystery kept secret since the world began, but now is made
manifest, Romans 16.25. as though this was hidden all the time from Moses to John
the Baptist. It is strange a man should thus apply Scripture without unfolding
the sense of it: but it is his course throughout his Book. The scope Quasi

of this place, if you consider the connection with the 26. verse. (but now is
made manifest, and by the Scriptures of the Prophets, according to the
commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all Nations for the
obedience of faith) is quite contrary to his application of it, and makes
against him. (And by the Scriptures of the Prophets) The Apostle makes mention
of this (if any should make doubt of his Preaching) as a sufficient evidence to
prove that the Doctrine of the Gospel, was no new or fained Doctrine. And that
he did deliver nothing but what of old the Prophets did foretell, should come
to pass: And therefore it could not be a mystery, hidden and kept secret from
Moses and the Prophets; (as he affirms falsely) for then they should have
foretold that which they knew not, which no man well in his wits will speak or
think. They did foreknow and foresee all those things concerning Christ, which
afterward were accomplished: This you may see proved, Luke 18.31. Then he
took unto him the twelve and said unto them, Behold we go up to Jerusalem,
and all things that are written by the Prophets, concerning the Son of man
shall be accomplished.

mystery is understood, First, the calling of the Gentiles. Secondly, Christ's
incarnation: This was the hidden mystery in regard of the Gentiles, who before
the coming of Christ did sit in darkness and in the shadow of death. And now
is made manifest, and how could the De gentibus nulla quaestio est, quiante
adventum Christi sedebant in umbra mortis, nee vitam hanc aeternam, quain
Christus suis artulit, aut intelligebant, aut expetebant: Qui poterant, cum

Gentiles know this seeing the predictions of the Messiah to come, were set
down and contained in the holy Scriptures? And these divine oracles were
peculiar to the Jews only, Psalm. 147.19.20. He shows his word unto Jacob,
his Statutes and his judgments unto Israel; he has not dealt so with any
Nation. The Gospel was hid from the Gentiles simply: Not so from the Jews,
but comparatively, in comparison of the clear light and manifestation of it
since the incarnation of Christ, as the Apostle himself expounds it, Ephesians.
3.5. which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now
revealed unto his holy Apostles and Prophets by the Spirit: So by this it is
plain it was in other ages made known: To use then this Scripture: (namely
Perpende totu^ progressum mysterii, suit quidem ab aeterno dispos^u^, and in
Deo absconditum, suit postea perprophetas patefactu^ in tempore hominibus, ut
crederent, postremo agnitum and revelatu^ gentibus, Cadinal. Tol. com. in loc.
Romans 16.25.) to prove that this mystery was kept secret and hidden from the
people of the Jews, from Moses to John Baptists time, is a false
interpretation; and misse-application of it, if he looks into the 26. verse he
may see this mystery is made manifest by the Scriptures of the Prophets: thus
you see his exposition is a contradiction, if made manifest by their writings,
then manifested to them. Again he uses 1 Pet. 1.10, 11, 12. The mystery the
Prophets searched after, as if he could prove by this place, that this mystery
was hid, and kept secret from Moses and the Prophets: but this Scripture makes
altogether against his absurdity, and plainly proves the contrary. The
Apostles Scopus Apostoli est removere calumniam illam, qua etiam tum temporis
doctrina Christiana gravabatur, esse eam doctrinam novam, atque hactenus
inauditam, atque incognitam; contrarium ergo hic asserit Petrus, declarans
etiam ab ipsis pro phetis eam esse testificatam, ac praedicatam, Jacobus
Lauren. com. in loc.
aim here, is to take off an aspersion which some at that time cast upon the
Doctrine of the Gospel, saying, as it is, Act. 17.19. May we know what this
new Doctrine whereof thou speak is? They did account it a new, unknown,
unheard of Doctrine: the Apostle affirms the contrary, declaring that it is
the same which was testified, and Preached by the Prophets themselves; who
prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: Searching what or what
manner of time, the Spirit of Christ, which was in them did signify; when it
testisied beforehand, the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should
follow. So that from this place it is evident the Prophets did not only
declare the time, but the particular time when the Messiah should come. They
Non modo scrutati sunt and praedixe^ ut modum redemptionis, sed etiam
investigare deside^ant, tempus and temporis articulum, quo seculo, post quot
annos mundi, in quem diem and momentum, vel etiam cujusmodi populi Judaici

Com. in loc. fol. mihi 1032.
did not in vain search what or what manner of time, for they found out the
very point of time; Jacob the Patriarch sets down the express time, Genesis
49.10. The Scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a Lawgiver from between
his feet, until Shilo come. And so the Prophet Daniel, 9.24, 25. sets down
the particular time of his coming, namely, seventy weeks: And is it not set
down plainly, that he should come presently after the birth and coming of
John Baptist, his forerunner? Malach. 3.1. Behold I will send my Messenger,
and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord whom ye seek, shall
suddenly come to his Temple. And Isaiah prophesied most manifestly, and in
special of Salvation from the free grace of God, through Jesus Christ, Isa.
53.11. By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many, for he shall
bear their iniquities, Habak. 2.4. The Prophets did not only declare his
sufferings, but the particular manner, Psalm. 22.16. They pierced my hands and
my feet: And the like concerning his burial, Isa. 5.9. likewise his
Resurrection and Ascension: Did the Prophets tell of the particular time, and
particular passages; and could this mystery be hid and kept secret from them?
how could they then speak so distinctly, and plainly of it? But let us go on
still with the Scripture, he applies for his purpose to prove it hidden, 1
Pet. 1.12. Unto whom it was revealed: What was Mysterium enim Christi quod suit
eis revelatum, non fuit eorum tempotibus, impletum, sed tempore Christianorum,
Lyranus in loc.
revealed? why, the Mystery of the Grace of God by Christ: the Prophets in

searching were not deluded, but did know the manner, and the time of the grace
to be revealed: And that not unto themselves, but unto us: the meaning is, that
those things which they spoke of, concerning the Birth, Passions, and
Resurrection of Christ, should not be fulfilled in their time, but in our
times: the benefit and fruit of which, did no less belong to them then to us;
See how he does wrest and mis-aply the Scripture. One question, and I have done
with this. The Text says, The Prophets searched: who were those Prophets? by
Hic nunc intellige Prophetas Testamenu veteris, Isa^am, Jeremia^, and cae^eros,
sub quibus tamen etiam M^ses. and Patriarchae co^prehenden^ur, Laurent. com. in
loc.
Prophets understand the Prophets of the old Testament, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and
others, under whom also Moses and the Patriarchs are comprehended, Luke 24, 27.
Beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, See ver. 44. the words following in
the Text prove this exposition; (who prophesied of the grace that should come
unto you) if by Prophets here we are to understand Moses for one, how does this
Scripture prove that Moses did not speak according as the Truth was, and is,
in Christ Jesus; because this was the hidden Mystery, kept secret from him?
Nay, it proves the contrary, to wit, That he did speak according as the Truth
was, and now is in Christ Jesus, because as the Apostle says, he prophesied of
the Grace that should come, which prophecy accordingly is now fulfilled.

At the latter end of page 27. he makes an objection which came into his head
since he preached the Sermon, for then he did not mention it. (his words are
these) But you will say, Moses wrote of me? (he answers) True, so did all the
Prophets write of Christ to come, but not present. Christ, I say, was ever by
faith present to believers: but mark how plainly he contradicts himself: Our
Lords Argument stands thus, Joh. 5.46. Had you believed Moses ye would have
believed me, for he wrote of me. First, by his conclusion; our Saviors
Argument, and what he necessarily inferres, falls to the ground; for if Moses
did not speak according as the truth was, and now is in Christ Jesus; how
could they by believing him have believed Christ? Secondly, the ground of
Christ's Argument is overthrown: if this mystery was hidden and kept secret,
how could Moses have wrote of him in such plain terms; Asserit Mosen de se
scripsisse non solum disertis vaticinus, sed etiam ^y porum umbris, Gerhard.
locor. com. 3. col. mihi 229.
Insomuch that Christ says, If ye had believed what Moses wrote, yea would
have believed me. It is then concluded from our Saviors own argument, that
Moses did write so plainly of him, that if they had believed him, they could
not but have believed Christ: All that Moses spoke was concerning Christ and in
reference to him, whether that he did foretell him in the figures of things
done or spoken: or whether that he did commend, and set forth the grace, and
glory of Jesus Christ: observe still how he does contradict himself and
blaspheme Moses: He confesses he wrote of Christ to come, not present: Well
then, if Moses spoke of Christ to come, at that time when he spoke it, he spoke
according as the Truth was in Christ Jesus; for he was to come. And now Christ
being come, it is plain he spoke according as the truth now is in Christ Jesus;
for that which he said should come to pass concerning Christ is now fulfilled,
and our Savior confirms this, Omne quod scripsit Moses de Christo est, id
est, ad Christum omnino pertinet, sive; quod cum figuris rerum vel gestarum,
vel dictarum prae nunciet, sive quod ejus gratram, gloria^^que commender, Aug.
tom. 6. contra Faust. li. 16. cap. 9.
Luke 24, 25, 26, 27. Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to
believe all that the Prophets have spoken, ought not Christ to have suffered
these things, and to enter into his glory? and beginning at Moses and all the
Prophets, etc. Where he concludes, that what Moses had spoken concerning him,
must be fulfilled, and was, and is fulfilled, see Luke 18.31. and thus it is
evident that Moses spoke then according as the Truth now is in Christ Jesus.

Again, he says, Moses spoke of Grace and Truth hereafter to be Modus
Parefactionis ac respectus temporis non mutant tem^psam, Romans 16.26. Nunc
manifestatum, hoc est tempore, N.T. ergo sub V. T. ignotum; tesp^ibidem d^serte

revealed: but not for the present manifested: This plaster is too little to
heal the sore, whosoever has the laying of it on: he cannot hide and keep
secret his own mystery of iniquity thus: I mean his false Doctrine: Grace and
Truth was then revealed and manifested as sufficiently to the salvation of
believers as now it is. Whereas he says, hereafter to be revealed, I say
again, it was then revealed, and was for substance one and the same then, as
it is now, though not manifested in so high a degree and measure.

Page 31. at the latter end, and at the beginning of page 32. he says, there
are two things requisite: First, That we lay a sure foundation. Secondly, That
we build rightly thereon, and make right application of this foundation; I
speak not these things holy brethren, (says he) to Hoc est ingenium
humilitatis, in seintueri sna mala, in aliis eorum bona, L^ssius de virt. Temp.
anne x. lib. 4. c. 4. n. 48.
teach you, by whom I desire rather to be taught: Why should a man lie against
his own conscience? he came not to be taught, but to tax, and to build his
own praises, upon the foundation of false aspersions, cast by himself upon
other men's Ministry. And what he is that will raise a false report, and vent
it in a Pulpi^, judge you: He desires to be taught; Away with this humble
pride, and proud humility! his own words following show his mind: He says,
He came to communicate his Doctrine, and to give satisfaction the rather,
because it has seldom or never been free from cavillations, (as he calls it)
and exceptions: by his own confession, his Doctrine has been always
excepted against: it is because it has been always false, and erroneous. And
whereas he says, It was an unjust report, that he would never dare to speak
those things in public before the learned, which he taught his people at
home. This is a true report, for he could never be brought to dispute before
the Ministers, though he has been earnestly challenged and urged thereunto:
He goes on still to praise Cont^a natural est humilitatis lauds proprias
praedicare, Gulielm. Parisien. de morib. cap. 10.
himself: He says, it has been his care to lay a sure, and sound
foundation: What need he take care to lay a sure and sound foundation, that is
already laid, according to that Scripture, 1 Cor. 3.11. which he names in the
beginning of page 33. From whence observe this; that if no Quia aliud
fundamentum poni minime potest, jam constab^t patres qui fuerunt ante legem,
and sub lege vixerunt, in Christo haesisse: alioqui ad salutem and regnum
coelorum non suissent aedificati, Pet. Mart. in loc.
other foundation can be laid, it is evident, that the Fathers who were before
the Law, and those who lived under the Law, did stay themselves upon Christ, as
upon a sure foundation. Otherwise they could not have been built up to
Salvation, and to the Kingdom of Heaven. From hence we may gather, what the
state of the Church was from Adam to Moses, which he professes himself to be
ignorant of, Page 19. Os^and. Epi^om. cent. 2. cap. 9.
Marcion the heretic does affirm, that all the Patriarchs and Prophets from
M^ses to John the Baptist, were not partakers of Salvation: Surely they will
be all hard put to it: if, as he affirms, That the knowledge of actual and
eternal remission of sins was no Article of their Cre^d: or, as he delivered
it in the Pulpit, That the People of the Jews had not Actual knowledge of
eternal remission of sins. Marcion and he dispose of the Fathers both alike.
Iren^us calls Marcion (justly) the mouth of the Devil. And when men should
stand in Gods stead, let them take heed they do not deliver the Devils
message: and while they Multi sunt qui nomen Christi quum obtendunt, radicitus
evellunt universam Dei veritatem, Calvin Com. in Epist. ad 1 Corin. cap. 3.11.
pretend to lay a sure foundation, do as much as in them lies, to raze the
true foundation. The foundation is Supra fundamentum Apostolorum and
Prophetarum, id est, super doctrinam eorum; vel aliter; id est, supra Christum
qui est fundamentum Apostolorum and Prophetartun, Aquin. com. in loc. lect. 6.

laid, namely Christ; and the Doctrine of Christ; which Doctrine is contained
in the Old and New Testament, in the writings of the Apostles and Prophets,
Ephesians. 2.20. And are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets,
Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; By foundation we may
understand the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, because their Doctrine
had respect altogether to Christ the Foundation: Observe here, that although
the Apostles and Prophets were many; yet it is not said in the plural number,
foundations; but in the singular, foundation Quamvis Apostoli and prophetae
multi fuerint, non tamen hic dicuntur plurali numero fundanaenta, sed
sundametnu^, quasi unum, ut per hoc consensus, and concordia doctrinae cum ca
quam olim tradiderant propherae significaretur, Estus com. in loc
as of one; to signify unto us that the Doctrine of the Apostles was one and
the same; and agreed in one, namely Christ: it being the whole work of both to
set forth Christ unto us, and to settle us upon him the Foundation; our work
then is not about laying the Foundation; but the saving and true application of
it.

Page 33. in the latter end are these words, I find that the greatest
difference between the Papist and the Protestant, is not about the foundation,
who it is, but about the true and right application of this foundation. But
stay a little, 1 Timothy 2.5. For there is one God and one Mediator between God
and man, the man Christ Jesus. This is the Foundation, the Papists deny this.
The greatest difference then betwixt them and us will appear plainly to be
about the Foundation.

Papisticall Transubstantiation, is repugnant to the humane nature of Christ,
and does altogether destroy it. The reason is plain, for by that they do
affirm the body of Christ to be invisible, inpalpable, incircumscript, and
illocall: All which is against the essential properties of a true humane body,
such a one as Christ had, and now has, and does retain after his
resurrection, and glorification; as is manifest, Luke 24.28. Mark, 16.6. The
School Duobus modis dicitur in Scripturis aliquid locale, sive
circumscriptibile and e converso, vel quia dimensionemeapiens longitudinis,
altitudinis, and latitudinis, distantiam facirin loco, ut corpus; vel quia loco

Toll spacia locorum corporibus, nusquam erunt, and quia nusquam erunt,

affirms, that it is the property of a body, to be so limited and determined
to one place, that it cannot be in every place: but the Papists do by their
real presence affirm, the body of Christ to be omnipresent, and thereby do
utterly overthrow his humane nature. Take away the spaces or dimensions of
places from bodies, and then they shall be no where; And because they shall be
no where, they shall not be at all: Take away the bodies themselves from the
qualities of bodies, and there shall be no place where they are. And therefore
it follows necessarily that they be not at all. And thus you see the Papists
do quite take away the foundation.

We hold Christ, as he is set forth to us in the doctrine of the Apostles, and
Prophets, to be the only foundation. Do not the Papists in making their
Council. Trident. Sess. 4.
Traditionsof equal Authority with Scripture, go about to lay another
foundation? is not this a wide difference? I might instance in other
fundamentalls: but he does plainly confute, and contradict himself, when he
says, the Papists do deny Christ coming in the flesh. And this is a
misfoundation.

Page 34. He propounds this question. I will therefore ask the wise Jesuit,
how we come to be partakers of Christ's Righteousness, and I am sure I shall
have this answer; by Sacraments, by Penance, Faith and other good works, which
are a means to apply Christ unto us. I believe he is a man that has not much
troubled himself in reading controversies between the Papists and us, neither
has any insight into the Jesuits: If he ask some of the learned Papists, how
we come to be justified in the sight of God, Causa efficiens primaria est
honitas, and miscricordia Dei, Bellar. Tom. 4. de Justificat. cap. 2.

Prima justiria, per quam ex impiis reddimur justi, non ex merito, sed ex
misericordia Dei, Bellar. de Justif. tom. 4. lib. 4. cap. 21.


Bellarmine will answer; that the primary, and efficient cause, is the
goodness, and mercy of God: And according to his distinction of first and
second Justification, he will tell you that in the first Justification, whereby
a wicked man becomes Just in the sight of God, it is not from merit, but from
Gods free mercy. And Cardinal Quoniam diximus ad justitiam nos pervenire per
fidem; and justitiam Christi nobis donatuam: Inde est quod experimento videmus
vitos sanctos, qui quanto majus in veritate proficiunt, tanto minus hbi
placent, ac proprerea tanto magis intelligunt, se indigere Christo, and
Justitia Christi sibi donata, ideoque se relinquunt, and soli Christo
incumbunt, Rivet. Cathol. Orth. tom. 2. page mihi 243. vide plura ibid.
Contarenus says, we are justified by Faith, and that the righteousness of
Christ given unto us whereby we are inserted into Christ, and have put on
Christ, is that certain, solid foundation, upon which we must stay our
selves, and believe, that for that alone we are justified before God: that is,
to be accounted just, and to be just; and he does plainly show that we are
not justified by the works of Sanctification, or by any inherent
righteousness in our selves; but by the righteousness of Christ, freely
given, and communicated unto us; Thus this Papist tells us, that we are made
partakers of Christ's Righteousness, not by penance or any works of ours, but
from the free gift of God.

That of wicked men we are made just in the sight of God, is by being made
partakers of Christ's righteousness: now whereas he says, Page 34. That the
Jesuit will say, by Sacraments, penance, faith, and other good works, we are
made partakers of Christ's Righteousness, and that they are a means to apply
Christ unto us; The Papists will deny this to his face. Bellarmin upon Romans,
cap. 4, 5. (where the Apostle makes it plain, That we are not justified by
works) says, Paul Paulus ad R^m. 4. dicit non ex operibus justiheari, etc.
Nos igntur di^mus Paulum loqui de prima justificatione, qua homo ex impio fir
justus, and ideo recte Paulu^ dicere hominem justificari sine operibus.
Quemadmodum enim nemo po est opere suo seips. procreate, aut a morte revocare:
procreatus autem, vel a morte revocatus, ipse se comedendo, and bibendo,
nutrit, and auget. sic etiam homo per peccatum mortuus, non potest merito
opetum suotum, se justificare, Bellarm. de Justif. tom. 4. lib. 4. cap. 18.
col. mihi 267.
speaks here of the first Justification; whereby a man of wicked is made just,
in the sight of God, and therefore Paul says rightly, that a man is justified
without works: He uses this illustration: As no man is able by his own work
to procreate himself, or to recall himself from death; but being procreated,
and made alive, from the dead, then he does by eating and drinking nourish
himself, and grows: So a man that is dead in sin, cannot by the merit of
his own works justify himself, but after God has justified him; he is able
by living well, to cherish and increase righteousness in himself, and of just,
to become more just; which the Papists call the second Justification; and so
they labor to bring in merit, and justification by works; We deny this second
justification; And concerning the first justification he says, we are made
partakers of that righteousness, not from merit, but from the mercy of God.

The Apostle tells us how we come to be made partakers of Christ's
Righteousness, Romans 3.24. Being justified freely by his grace through the
redemption that is in Jesus Christ: Ask the Council of Trent Cum vero
Apostolus dicir homini^m justificari, perhdem and gratis; ea verba in eo sensu
intelligenda sunt, quem perpetuus Ecclesiae Carholicae consensus tenuit, and
expressit, ut scilicer ignitur per fidem justincari dicamur, qua fides est
human^ salntis initium, fundamentum, and radix, omnis justineationis, line qua
imp^ssibile est placere Deo, and ad filiorum ejus confortium pervenire: gratis
autem justificari ide^^ d^^auaut, quia nihil comm quae justificationem
pracedunt, five ^des, sive opera, ipsam justification S^tatiam promeretur; si
enim gratia est, jam non e^ ope^^bus, alioquin ut idem Apostolus inqu^^, pratia
jam non est gratia, Council. Trildent. Sess. (...) 8.
and they will tell you in their exposition upon this place, that we are
justified (that is to say, made partaker of Christ's Righteousness) freely,
because none of those things which precede, or go before justification,
whether faith, or works, do deserve, or merit the grace of justification,
according as the Apostle says, If by grace, then it is no more of works,
otherwise grace is no more grace, Romans 11.6.

Again, ask Cardinal Gratiam appel at Dei donum nobis gratuitum, quod nos
nullis nostris meritis, nulla nostra virtute, justos facit, Tolet. com. in loc.
Tolet, who was a wise Jesuit, and he will answer, that when the Apostle
says, We are justified freely by his grace, he calls grace the free gift of
God given to us. And that God does make us just without any of our own merits;
without any excellency in us.

Ask Quod sequitur, per gratiam ipsius, (...) additum est, ac si dica, gratis,
id est, per gratiam ipsius; nam sensus est, homines peccatores justificari
absque ullo suorum operum merito, persolam gratuitam Dei bonitatem, Estius,
com. in loc.
Estius the learned Jesuit; and he will answer, that when the Apostle says,
We are justified freely by his grace, his meaning is, that sinful men are
justified without any merit of their own works, by the alone free grace of
God; And Nunc satis sit dicere; hic agi de prima justificatione, per quam ex
injusto hamo fit justus; quaeque non fit merito bonorum operum heminis,
Pererius in cap. 3. ad Romans Disput. 13.
Pererius the Jesuit upon this place of the Apostle says, that it does
concern the first Justification, by which, of unjust, a man is made just;
which is not done by the merit of the good works of man. I go not about to
justify the Papists: but to show you how this Pamphletour does out of
ignorance (in this particular) falsely charge them.

Whereas he speaks so confidently, page 34. at the latter end in these words:
And I know you are not ignorant that there is no small difference between the
Protestants themselves: How we come to be made partakers of Christ's
Righteousness. He should have done well, to have showed wherein they differ;
and not to make a fault where he can find none: to make way for his false
accusation, he goes on: I appeal to your Judgments: (he means his own
judgment, in his misinformed hearers) How they differ from Papists, who say
that Christ's righteousness is made ours before God by faith, and true
repentance, which is by them defined to be a sorrow for sin and amendment of
life, as though our Protestant Divines should make faith and repentance joined
together to be the material and meritorious cause of our justification before
God. It is a wonder a man should dare to be so impudent, to invent such a false
slander against our Church: he shows himself to be a man little read in
Protestant writers; and less conversant with our Protestant Divines: I dare
say he cannot name one. It will appear by the Articles of Religion which we
Protestants here in England are bound to read (when we come to any Church
living to be possessed of it) and subscribe to; with an acknowledgement of our
full consent, and approbation to, and of them; that the Protestants hold the
clean contrary: I will here set down the very words of the In the 39. Article.
Article for that purpose: And they are these: We are accounted righteous
before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, by faith,
and not for our own works or deservings. Wherefore that we are justified by
faith only, is a most wholesome Doctrine and very full of comfort. Now I
appeal to the Judgment of those that can but read English, and are able to
understand it, whether he has not deeply wronged the Protestants, and showed
himself ignorant in a fundamental point of our Religion: He would, if any
will be so simple as to believe him, make us worse then some Papists Firma and

: who hold it to be true, and sound Doctrine: that sinners are justified by a
true and lively faith, whereby they apprehend the mercy of God promised in
Christ, and are sensible that of Gods free bounty, and goodness they have
received remission of their sins, and Reconciliation, for the merit of
Christ: and do cry Abba Father. What Protestant ever joined faith and
repentance together in point of Justification before God? we say faith only
does justify in the sight of God, in opposition to works yet this faith is
not without an inward change of the heart, and true repentance: we must
distinguish between the formal Fidei (...) scrmalis distinguenda est ab ejus
(...) effectiva mortihcare carnem, testistere concupiscentiis catnis est (...)
fidei non formalis, sed effectiva, formalia autem hdej justincanris (...), est

Disp. Theof part 2. disp. 3. page mihi. 319.
Energy, or efficacy of faith and the effective: faith does not justify so
far forth as it does mortify the flesh in us, and bring forth the fruits of
good works; but as it does embrace the promise offered in the Gospel,
concerning the free remission of sins through Christ: or which is all one,
because that by faith the Righteousness of Christ is imputed unto us. Every
child that has learned his Catechism will, and is able to contradict him in
this divised falsehood against the Protestants.

Whereas he says: Repentance is by the Protestants defined to be a sorrow for
sin: I pass it by, till I come to speak of that Subject.

Page 35. He frames an argument thus: That which makes Christ's Righteousness
ours in the fight of God, may be said truly to justify us before God, or at
least to concur actively to our justification: but faith and sorrow for
sin, with amendment of life, make Christ's righteousness ours in the sight of
God: Therefore fearful will be the conclusion, faith and sorrow for sin
with amendment of life concur actively to our justification: It must needs be
fearful for him, thus lewdly to accuse the Protestants: Oh horrid malice! Do
but view his Argument well, and see whether this be a Protestant Doctrine, That
faith and sorrow for sin, with amendment of life, make Christ's Righteousness
ours in the sight of God, according as he lays it down, in his fearful
conclusion: We say that we are justified in the sight of God by Non tantum
fidem justificare, sed etiam solam justificare, neque admittere in came
societatem ullam aliam virtutem, ulla opera quaecunque sint, quocunque
censeantur nomine, quocunque comprehendantur genere, id est, non spe, non
charitate, non poenitentia, non receptione Sacramentorum, non castitate, non
justitia, non pietatte sua quenquam posse justificari, sed tantum fide,
Chamier, Paustrat. Cathol. Tom. 3. de Justific. lib. 22. cap. 1 fol. mihi 923.
17.
faith alone, without the works of the Law: and so we are made partakers of
Christ's righteousness: and that becomes ours in the sight of God, Gal. 2.16.
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but by the faith
of Jesus Christ, etc. We hold that Faith does justify alone, and does not
admit into its society any other virtue, any other work whatsoever; neither
can any man be justified by his hope, charity, Repentance, receiving the
Sacraments, chastity, righteousness, piety, but only by Faith. True faith
absolutely considered, cannot be separated from works, it is not without
charity and repentance, but considered relatively in its relation, it
justifies without works: So that although true Faith cannot be without good
works, (as Saint James says) Faith without works is dead: nor good works
rightly considered, cannot be without faith; yet in regard of justification,
they are manifestly in opposition the one against the other. And such is the
nature of opposites, that they cannot stand together: if one be laid down, the
other of necessity must be taken away: Lay this down for a ground, that we are
justified by Faith, then justification by works must needs be denied. We
cannot conceive any moment of time wherein Justifying Faith is without good
works, in regard of their Particula sola, removet opera, non ab actu
praes^n^iae, sed a communicatione efficientiae; hoc est, non ut adesse fidei,
and justificatis, sed fidei in a^^^ justification^, ^o op^^a^i n^g^^ tur,
Ge^hard. locor. t^m. 3. de Justi^. Sent. 6 fol. mihi 607.
presence: but they do not communicate, or do any thing; neither have they
any hand in Justifying of a sinner in the sight of God, but are only standers
by: And thus we deny that sorrow for sin with amendment of life justify us
before God: neither do we join them with f^^h in point of justification of a
sinner in the sight of God: let ^^m but name any one Protestant W^^er, or any
Divine in all (...) Country, that is guilty of that which he here lays to
th^^ charge: I persuade my self he cannot. To tax the Protestants with a
thing contrary to their Doctrine: which they openly profess, and have with
their own hand subscribed to: he shows himself most injurious, and
unchristian. When he preached his Sermon, his aim was to blemish the
Ministers; and now he has done it in Print: but let him produce any man, if he
can; That he may recant his false Doctrine (if he have delivered it) and be
brought to the knowledge of the truth: or if not, that he may recant his false
aspersion, and be taught hereafter to speak the truth.

Whereas, in his conclusion, he says, Faith and sorrow for sin with
amendment of life, justify us before God, or at least concur actively to our
justification. Oh fearful conclusion, in regard of the false inventour! The
Protestants conclude no such thing. They hold that faith it self alone,
justifyeth only passively, as it receives Propterea in stam controversiae
dictum, fidem justificare, non quatenus opus est, five per se, sed relative, id
est, quatenus siguificat applicationem justitiae Christi, id est, non nostrae,
sed alienae, Chamier. Tom 3. de fide, Justif. lib. 22. cap. 11. fol. 957.
Christ, not actively in respect of the work, and merit thereof. For we are
justified by the Righteousness of God, which is by Faith of Jesus Christ, Romans
3.22. but the Act and work of Faith, is a part of man's Righteousness (not of
Gods) therefore so faith Quatenus fides est opus and pars quaedam inhaerentis
renovationis, River. Catholic. Orthod. Tom. 2. fol. 260.

Non privamus came bonis operibus, sed duntaxat excludimus bona opera a causis
efficientibus justificationis: bona opera non praecedunt justificandum, sed
sequuntur justificatum, Polanus Syntagm. fol. mihi 456.


justifyeth not, but as it apprehends the righteousness of God in Christ:
faith whereby we are justified is to be considered, partly as it is passive;
partly, as it is active: It is passive in apprehending the promises of God in
Christ, and applying Christ with all his benefits, in which respect, faith
only justifyeth. It is also active in bringing forth good fruits, and
quickening of us unto every good work, but so it justifyeth not: faith then is
inseparably joined with hope and love, and necessarily yields in us good
fruits, but none of all these do concur with Faith in the Act of
Justification, but it is the office only of Faith, to apply unto us the
Righteousness of Christ, whereby only we are made righteous before God: So
that you see we do hold that faith it self does not concur actively to our
justification: much less then sorrow for sin, and amendment of life. Faith
is considered sometime as a quality and gift of God inherent in us: but
hitherto and in this respect it justifies not; but as it is in the predicament
of Relation, because it apprehends Christ in the Gospel. If it be objected that
apprehension is an action; Faith therefore to be a work. It is answered, that
although according to Grammar, apprehension is a word active: yet in
signication it is truly passive: For to apprehend, is to receive good things
offered, as the Apostle uses the phrase, Phil. 3.12. If I may apprehend that
for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Faith receives those good
things offered in the Gospel, and Fides non exhibet aliquid Deo sicut

loquitur Lutherus) and est velut spiritualis manus, quae oblatum thesaurum

Gerhard (speaking in Luthers words) says, Faith suffers it self to be well
done to, and benefited: and is the Spiritual hand which receives the Treasure
offered, and so is only passive.

Page 35. he confesses some Protestants, holy men, d^e say, that Christ is
made ours, in the sight of God by faith alone: Christ being the garment, our
faith the hand that puts this garment on. Yet (says he) me thinks that
here is Christ set forth upon some Conditions, and not so freely given. You see
he cannot agree with these holy men: as though Christ in the Covenant of grace
may not be set forth upon some condition, and yet freely given: Can a Covenant
bemade without any condition: is it not against the nature of a Covenant. The
word Covenant in the Hebrew (...) strictly taken is a league Pactum est quod
int^r aliquos convenit, nam ut fiat pactum requiritur ut duae voluntates in
idem conveniant reciproco consensu, Bierlir. Magn. Theatr. lib. 14. fol. 1.
or agreement made between parties that are at variance, containing in it a
mutual obligation: And the Hebrew word has the signification of friendly
parting, and of explaining the conditions of Agreement that a Covenant may be
made, it is required, that two wills do by a reciprocal consent agree in one
and the same thing: The Covenant of works is a league touching the saving of
some, on condition of their perfect obedience, Gal. 3.12. And the Law is not of
faith, but the man that does them, shall live in them: see Levit. 18.5. It is
plain that perfect obedience is the condition of the Covenant of works: The
Covenant of Grace is an agreement concerning men to be freely saved through
faith in Christ, Gal. 3.11. The just shall live by Faith: May not Faith be said
to be the condition required in this Covenant? And is not Christ here set forth
upon this condition? and yet Christ and the condition too, freely given to us
of God; as is fully made plain Fides hic consideratur non ut opus quoddam
nostrum a Deo in nobis exci atum, sed ut instrumentum quo recipimus, and
amplectimur salutem ac gratiam; est autem necesse ut accipias salutem, ac
gratiam si servari velis: Itaque fides quatenus est instrumentum recipiens
salutem, nihil impedit quin salus tota sit gratuita, Zanc. in loc. qu. 2.
Ephesians. 2.8. For by grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of our
selves, it is the gift of God: The Lord resolving to give us Christ, does
require at our hands that we should receive him and to this end gives us
faith, that we might be enabled thereunto: and therefore faith, as it is an
instrument receiving Christ with all his benefits: does not at all hinder, but
that Christ is freely given, because that in our justification, and salvation,
Faith does not merit; or do any thing, but only receive Christ: Whereas he
says: He does here profess his ignorance, and that he cannot conceive how
faith should put on Christ, apply Christ, or make Christ ours, in the sight of
God, I believe him: but because he has not as yet had experience of such a
work of grace upon his own soul, must it therefore necessarily follow, that
no soul else has had it? because the fool has said in his heart there is no
God; and he says true, for in his heart there is no God: must it therefore
follow, that there is no God in any man's heart? I profess my self (says he)
to lean unto them, that say that Christ's righteousness is made ours before
God, by Gods imputation, before the act of our faith, and therefore necessarily
without it.

By the Act of faith which does consist in believing and receiving Christ's
righteousness imputed, we do not understand the work of faith; but the

work of God; for so faith is called, not our work, but the work of God, Joh.
6.29. This is the work of God that ye believe on him, whom he has sent:
therefore the Act of believing is the work of God; which none of the godly
will deny, and it is plain by the Apostles words, Romans 12.3. According as God
has dealt every man the measure of faith: Musculus upon this place says, that
the act of believing is also our work: for it is not said here, this is the
work of God that he should believe; but that ye believe in him: but yet this
Act of believing this work of ours (as he calls it) stands in absolute
opposition to justification by works in the sight of God: as is plain by our
Saviors intent in this place: wherein he does labor to confute those who held
justification by the works of the Law: He does not say, this is the work of
God: that ye should be circumcised, purified, keep the Sabbath, and observe
legal Rites and Ceremomies: Neither does he say, these are the works of God:
That ye repent, that ye fear and love God above all and your neighbor as
your self: not but that these works are necessary, and commanded in Scripture
and are the Quae omnia non nisi piorum sunt et in Scripturis magno serio
praecipiuntur, nisique operante deo in nobis fieti nequeunt. Tacitis his
omnibus unum tantum fidei opus adducit, dicens, Hoc est opus dei. etc. Non quod
reliqua pietatis opera non sint opera dei, sed quod soli fid^i^ cibus vitae

works of God: but to show that faith alone is required for the justification
of a sinner in the sight of God: that so he might plainly overthrow
Justification by Works, which they altogether insisted upon, and therefore
tells them that all their works though never so holy and good avail nothing
in the matter of justification: but that they must be justified by faith alone:
This is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he has sent. Musculus
upon this place to illustrate how this work of faith is Gods work, and our
work, has this comparison: As the writing of the child, whose hand the
Schoolmasters does guide, while he is a writing; this is called the Boys
work, and his Masters: Now consider the Master takes his Pen and places it in
his hand, he frames and fashioneth every Letter, the boy must not stir his
hand in the writing one jot, or tittle, but as his master does stir and move
it. It Is true the boy has a hand in the writing, but his hand is merely
Passivum opus est (ut ita loquar) Calvin in loc.
passive, the master does all. To apply this: consider faith as a work in
regard of justification: Calvin upon this place takes that liberty to call it
a passive work, and that it is so is plain, John 1.12. But to as many as
received him, to them gave he power to bocome the Sons of God, even to them
that believe on his name: You see then, to believe is to receive Christ; and
though (To Credere) that is, to believe, be a Verb active in regard of
Nomination, yet it is passive in regard of signification; for that we call the
act of faith in In nomen Christi credere est illum recipere, tanquam filium
dei, and salvatorem mundi, ergo quinon credunt, Christum non recipient: Nam
sine fide non recipitur: Muscul. com. in loc.
justification, which is to believe, signifies nothing but to receive Christ:
therefore the act of faith considered as I have here set it down: To say that
Christ's righteousness is made ours before God, by Gods imputation before the
Act of our faith; and therefore necessarily without it: This is blasphemy, and
false Doctrine. The Scripture says, We are justified by Faith; Here is a
Doctrine quite contrary, namely, That we are justified without faith.

B^t Page 36. You see evidently that he labors to prove that we are justified
by Gods imputation of Christ's righteousness without faith; to which purpose he
argues thus: Even as our sins were made Christ's, so Christ's righteousness is
made ours; now how our sins were made Christ's, let the Prophet Esaias Id nunc
repetit quod nimuum paenam quam nos exol vere debeamus, deus ipsi imposuent,
candem vero ipse in se receperit tanquam voluntarius Gualter in Isa Hom. 267.
speak, Cap. 53.6. And the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all:
(that is, the guilt and punishment of our iniquities;) well then, the Lord laid
it upon Christ, and he willingly received it, 1 Pet. 2.24. Who his own self
bare our sins in his own body: God laid them on him, Christ by his passive
obedience received this burden, as Heb. 5.8. He learned obedience by the
things which he suffered: So then according to his conclusion, God lays our
sins upon Christ; and Saint Ambrose upon this Scripture, says, that he did
willingly receive those things which he suffered: So God lays Christ's
righteousness upon us by imputation; and we by the passive obedience of Faith
receive it: And by this it is plain that God imputes Christ's righteousness
to none but such as do believe; for Imputation is an action of God freely
accounting the righteousness of Christ to be his righteousness who believes
in Christ, Romans 4.3.4. and it was imputed (or accounted) to him for
righteousness, that is, Faith was imputed. Faith here must be considered two
ways; first, as a quality in it self, and thus it is imperfect, and
consequently, cannot be imputed unto us for our justification: Again, faith
must be considered as an instrument, or hand receiving Christ: and in this
regard believing is put for the thing believed: and faith is imputed for right
ousnesse; because by it we do Paulus addit^n ^rptetationem, quod fide gratuita
impu atio accip^atu, Melanc^ par. 3. fol. mi^^ 958.
receive imputed righteousness, Romans 5.17. They which receive abundance of grace
and of the gift of righteousness (to wit, by faith) shall reign in life by one
Jesus Christ: These phrases of Speech; Faith is imputed for righteousness; Faith
justifies, of Faith, or through Faith; are Aequipollent, and of like force,
and signification: When we say, We are justified by faith, or faith is imputed
for righteousness, it is to be understood correlatively; the Ostendimus sidem
justificare non habitualiter, ut est qualitas, sed relate, quia cortelatum
fidei, satisfactio and meritum Christi fide apprehensum, justificat. Item
organ^c^, quia fides justitiam imputa^am accipit, instar dext^ae Pareus in cap.
3. ad Romans dub. 8.
correlate of faith is the imputed righteousness of Christ: Faith then being
the relate, Christ's righteousness the correlate, the one cannot be without the
other; for the Logician will tell you that relate and correlate considered as
such, that is, according to relation, they have their being together; so that
grant one, you must needs grant the other to be; take away the being of the
one, and he other cannot be: For we cannot conceive so much as one individed
instant of time wherein the one can have a being without the other: but they
have their being together at one and the same instant of time; not one before
or after the other: As a father, considered as a man, so he has the being of a
man before his son, but consider him as a father according to the relation
added; namely according to paternitie and filiation; and so, and in such
manner, the being of father and son is at one and the same instant. To
conclude, Faith being the relate, Christ's righteousness made ours by Gods Hoc
lo^o, sc Romans 4.34. fides non potest sumi eo sensu, ut imputetur ad justitiam
quatenus est opus aliquod justitiae, et virtutis in nobis, sed (quod nos
dicimus) quatenus fides sumitur pro correlato suomempe re credita, and fide
apprehen. sa, justitia Christi. Rivit. Or^hod. Cathol. Tom. 2. page 260.
imputation, the correlate, it cannot be but where there is righteousness
imputed, there must needs be Faith: for imputed righteousness and Faith of
necessity have their being together, for where no Faith is, there is no imputed
righteousness: And it is a contradiction of an high nature; not only in
Relatum and correlatum, qua ralia, simul sunt natura and cognitione, ideoque se
mu^uo ponunt and tollunt tam in essendo, quam in cognoscendo, Kekerman, System.
log. in praedicam. Relati. Can. 4.
Logic, but in the Scripture it self: In this fourth Chap. to the Romans this
word (imputed) is diverse times repeated in the Doctrine of justification, and
is joined unto Faith; without which there is no imputation of Christ's
righteousness to us: Imputation of righteousness and Faith have their being
together, grant one, you must grant the other, take away one, you must take
away the other, Romans 4.23.24. Now it was not written for his sake alone (namely
Abraham) that it was imputed to him; but for us also to whom it shall be
imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead: So
that without believing, Christ's righteousness cannot be made ours before God.

There is no space of time between justification and justifying Faith: for so
soon as a man believes, he is justified; and so soon as he is justified he
believes. Again, the Apostle opposes the Act of believing, to justification by
works; for the Act of believing is not our righteousness: The proper action
of Faith is apprehension: and the Act of Faith in justification is believing or
receiving Christ's righteousness: Now giving and receiving in regard of their
relation stand or fall together: Justification is Justificatio solet distingui
in Activam and passivam: Activailla dicitur quando deus justificat; passiva,
quando justificatur peccator. Distingui posse hic Justificationem, patet ex
ipsa ^erum natura, si enim est quidam qui justificat, quidam qui justificatur,
ergo est and Activa, and Passiva justificatio, Machowius, Disput. 17.
active and passive; Active in regard of God that justifyeth, Passive in regard
of man who is justified, passive in regard of us who do by faith receive
Christ, without which we cannot be justified. Thus you see how destructive his
Doctrine is to the maine fundamental point of our Religion: to wit,
justification by faith; So much pressed upon us by Christ, and his Apostles,
and by him denied. And justification without Faith, in the sight of God, is
such a justification as I never read of in Scripture.

We come to his objection and his answer to it, Page 36. at the latter end, But
it will be objected, How then is faith said to justify? I answer (says he) if
we take faith for the object of our faith (That is, Christ) then faith is
properly said to justify us: for by him we are justified, he being our
Righteousness: Mark here how he contradicts himself: He says before, he
cannot conceive how faith should put on Christ, and apply Christ, and that
Christ's righteousness is made ours before God, by Gods imputation before the
Act of our Faith, and therefore necessarily without it: And now confesses that
Faith being taken for the object of our Faith (Christ) then it is properly said
to justify us: and thus it is properly said to justify: Christ being
apprehended by Faith, Romans 3.28. Therefore we conclude a man is justified by
Faith without the works of the Law. So it is taken in the Treatise of
Justification; wheresoever Faith is written without express mention of Christ,
we are to understand the righteousness of Christ, received by Faith, Heb.
10.38. Now the just shall live by Faith: And does he not overthrow his Doctrine
before delivered? when he concludes, That Faith taken for the object of our
Faith does properly justify? and how can that be without Faiths apprehension
of the object? We will make this more plain if it may be, Romans 3.22. Even
the righteousness of God which is by Faith of Jesus Christ: The Ea est fides
Jesu Christi, non active quam ipse Christus habet, sed passive qua ipse
Christus habetur, seu posside^ur: Affert haec fides justitiam, non effective,
quasi habitualiter, aut form^li ^r, justos efficiat: nec materialiter, quasi
ipsa sit illud quo justi cens^n^ur; sed objective, quatenu^ fertur in Christum
qui est justitia nost^a^ et organice, quat^nus instar manus donum ^^^^itiae
gratis prop^er Christi meri^um credentib. imputatae apprehendit. Pare. Com. in
loc.
Faith of Christ is not here taken actively for the Faith which Christ had, but
passively for the Faith whereby Christ is had and possessed: This Faith does
not justify effectively, as working an habitual justice or righteousness in
us: nor materially, as though Faith it self were that whereby we are
justified; but it justifies objectively, as it apprehends Christ; and
instrumentally, as it applies the righteousness of Christ.

Object. How are we said to be justified freely; seeing Faith is required,
which is an act in the believer? This Objection may be urged further thus:
That is freely bestowed which is conferred without any help or work in the
receiver: seeing then a man must bring Faith, which is a work of the will: how
is he said to be justified freely?

The Answer is, that we are Si fides, qua ratione actus quidam est, et ex se
justitiam saceret, gratis justitia non daretur: at id non habet: Ego pauperi
scutum gratis porrigo, quod ille extensa manua me accipit, si quis mihi
objiceret, tu gratis non dedisti; nam et pauper manum extendit, nec
acciperetnisi id faceret, ridicula prosecto esset objectio: extensio en im
manus non habet ex se scutum adferre extendenti, si enins id esset; quoties
manum extenderet scutum haberet: A virtute potius et liberalitate dantis est
scutum: quamvis illi per manuum extensionem applicetur, ita defide; Tolet. ad
Romans cap. 3. Annot. 20

Deus imputans nobis justitiam Christi, dat nobis fidem qua illam applicate
valeamus Machowius, quae de stat. primi hominis, Disput. 7.


justified freely, although the condition of Faith be required, because Faith
does not justify as it is an act of ours, but all the virtue thereof
proceeds from the object; as the Israelites being healed by looking upon the
Brazen Serpent, obtained not their health, by the very act of opening their
eyes; but by the object which they beheld, which was the Serpent: And like as
when a rich man gives his Alms unto the poor, though he stretches out his
hand to receive it, yet it is said notwithstanding to be a free gift: but add
here further, that as when a blind man puts forth his hand, but he that
gives is feign to direct it, to receive the alms; or if a man have a weak
and withered hand, which he is not able to stretch out unless the other that
gives does lift it up: in this case every way the gift is free: So our will is
not of it self apt to believe or will any thing aright, unless the Lord
direct it: Faith then being both the work of God in inclining our will, and
Faith receiving all the virtue from the object which it apprehends, namely
Christ: it remains, that Faith notwithstanding, we are justified freely: And
the act of faith thus taken, as we have set it down, does according to
Scripture stand in opposition to justification by works: And thus Christ in
the Covenant of grace is set forth upon some condition, to wit, that we believe
in him; which condition, God does not only require at our hand, but does by
his Spirit freely give us, and enable us to perform it: And Christ freely
given, and all is done of Gods free grace and mercy.

It may be objected, men may be justified before they do believe, and so
without Faith, for they are justified in Gods decree from all eternity.

I answer, God has decreed before all time to justify some men in time, but
not without Faith; that being an effect of Gods decree, and believing being
that way, by which God has ordained to justify and save men, Docet autem hic
locus fidem ab election Dei dependere: Calvin in loc.
Act. 13.48. And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed, Gal. 3.24.
that we might be justified by Faith; and in the 26. Verse, for ye are all the
children of God by Faith in Christ Jesus: it is plain by these places of
Scripture, that God never made any such decree: as to justify any man before
he does believe; and it is blasphemy to charge such an Act upon God: For to
justify a man before he does believe; is to justify him in his Id est
impietatem impi^, Lapid. Com. in loc.
sinful ways, which God abhors, and is contrary to his proclamation, Exodus
34.7. that he will by no means clear the Nempe impoenitentem and in peccatis
suis sibi placentem, Rive^ Com. in loc.
guilty: Again, it is plain Ratio quasi a priori est quod deus per
essentiam, sit ipsa justitia increata, immensa, and fontalis, ab ^a ergovelut a
sonte manat omnis justitia creata, angelorum, and hominum, quam proinde ut suam
amat, ac vice versa, odit, and abominatur omnem injustitiam, quasi sibi
essentialiter contrariam, et a daemone prosectam, Cornel. a Lap. Com. in loc.
Prove. 17.15. He that justifies the wicked, and he that condemns the just,
even they both are abomination to the Lord: will God, who is the fountain of
justice, do that himself which he hates in others? if that place be
alleged, Romans 4.5. But to him that works not, but believes on him that
justifies the ungodly; and therefore a man is justified before he believes:
the meaning is expounded in these words of the Verse, his faith is counted for
righteousness: so that this must be understood (in sensu diviso) in a divided
sense; That God justifies the wicked, not him that remains wicked, but was
so before he was justified: And the School does briefly resolve this, God
justifies the ungodly (Antecedenter) antecedently, that is, him who before
justification was ungodly; not (consequenter) consequently, that is, him who
after justification remains ungodly.

Page 36. toward the latter end (says he) if we take Faith for the Act of our
Faith, apprehending this object, then we are justified by it declaratively in
our consciences; and concludes (that Faith does only justify declaratively)
speaking to our consciences that we are the children of God in Christ Jesus:
Thus you see he does exclude faith altogether from justifying a sinner in the
sight of God: And that it is only said to justify, because by it we come to
be certain, and to have assurance in our consciences that we are justified in
the sight of God; and as it does declare unto us our justification in the court
of conscience: Two gross absurdities will follow upon Faiths declarative
justification only (as he calls it.) The first is, that Faith does not at all
justify; (which is point black contrary to the Doctrine of Christ and his
Apostles) for it is one thing to be, and another thing, to appear to be: Faith
having no hand at all in the being of Justification, but in the making of it
appear to be: So that I am first justified in the sight of God, by Gods
imputation without Faith, and afterward Faith comes and makes it appear to me
that I am justified: And by it I come to have assurance in my conscience that
it is so: The second absurdity will be this, That where there is not assurance,
there is no faith: Faith being as he concludes, only an assurance that I am
justified: What will a distressed Conscience in case of spiritual desertion
do? this doctrine makes him desperate, for by this he argues the case thus:
Faith is nothing but an assurance to me in my conscience, that I am justified
in the sight of God; but I want this assurance; therefore I am without Faith,
and consequently in a damned condition, as the case now stands with me. Is this
preaching Christ and free grace? but I say, a man may want in his own
apprehension this assurance; and yet he may have Faith; Gods people sometimes
are in such a condition, that they cannot see so much as a glimpse of Gods
favor; Nay the contrary: They conclude themselves forsaken of God, and
cast-awayes; what is become now of assurance? but for all this, dare any man say
that men in this condition have no Faith? Nay, they are upheld by the secret
support of Faith; otherwise, in such a condition they would despair as Judas
did: but it is plain by Scripture, that a child of God may want assurance,
and yet by Faith stay himself upon God, Isay 50.10. Who is among you that
fears the Lord, that obeys the voice of his servant, that walks in
darkness, and has no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay
himself upon his God.

Take faith for the act of Faith, apprehending the object, and so we are
justified by faith only in the sight of God: in regard whereof the salvation
of all that truly believe is sure and certain, though they perhaps be not
assured thereof, for this is the promise of the Gospel, that whosoever
believes on him should not perish, but have life everlasting.

Take faith in reference to the Subject, for that which does declare our
justification to our consciences, and herein Fides illa proprie dicitur
justificans, qua incumbimus in Christum, ad remissionem pecca orum and salutem.
Christus enim est adaequatu^ objectu^ fidei quatenus fides justificat: fides
enim non alia ratione justificat, nisi quatenus a^prehendit illam justitiam,
propter quam justificamur; illa autem justitia non est, in veritate alicujus
axiomat^s, cui assensum p^aebemus; s^^ in Christo solo, qui factus est pro
nobis peccatum, ut nos essemus in ipso justitia, 2 Cor. 5 21. fides ista
justificans s^a natura producit atque adeo conjunctam secum habet specia^em ac
certam persuasionem de gratia, ac misericordia Dei in Christo, Ames. Medul.
Theol. lib. 1 cap. 27. de Just.
faith cannot not be said properly to justify, for this is an effect of
justifying faith. There are two degrees of justifying Faith, the one being a
lively assent to the promise of the Gospel; the other a sound application
thereof to our selves: by the former, as being the condition of the promise, we
are justified in the Court of Heaven, by the latter, in the Court of our own
conscience: which is not (properly) called justification, but the application
of justification; for a man must first be justified in the sight of God, before
he can be persuaded in his conscience of his justification, otherwise his
persuasion is a false persuasion, and a mere delusion: By the former we are
justified before God: by the latter we are persuaded in our conscience, and in
some measure assured of our justification. For the further clearing of this
distinction of Faith, let us consider the differences between the two degrees;
by the former, as I have said, we are justified before God in the Court of
heaven, by the latter we are justified in the Court of our own Conscience: by
the former we are justified properly, by the latter we are assured of our
justification: (I take this assurance to be an act of experience flowing from
justifying Faith.) Of the justification, which we have by the first degree,
(which is properly so called) there are no degrees Justitia nobis imputata,
persecta, and aequalis est in omnibus credentibus, Wolleb. Compend. Theol. lib.
l.c. 30.
; but of that which we have by the second degree, which is not justification,
but the assurance of it, there are degrees according to the measure of Faith:
of necessity we must hold this distinction of faith, viz. that there is one
degree of justifying faith, which in order of nature goes before Fides
justificans praecedit justificationem ipsam, ut causa suum effectum, sed fides
justificationem apprehendens prehenssatio praesupponit, ac sequitur
justificationem, ut actus objectum suum circa quod versatur, Ames. Medul. page
119.

Quod objicitur: vim justificandi non esse fidei ex seipsa, sed quatenus
Christum recipit, libenter admitto: nam si per se vel intrinseca virtute (ut
loquuntur) justificatet fides; ut est semper debilis, ac imperfecta, non
efficeret hoc nisi ex part, sic manca esset justitia, quae frustulum salutis
nobis conserret: Nos quidem nihil tale imaginamur, sed proprie loquendo Deum
unum justificare dicimus; deinde hoc idem transferimus ad Chrislum; quia datus
est nobis in justitiam. Fidem vero quasi visi conferimus, quia nisi exinaniti,
ad expetendam Christi gratiam, aperto animae ore accedimus, non sumus Christi
capaces; unde colligitur non detrahere nos Christi vim justificandi, dum prius
cum recipi fide docemus, quam illius justitiam, Calvin. Institut. lib. 3. cap.
11. Sect. 7.


remission of sins, by which we obtain forgiveness of sins, and by which we
are justified before God, Act. 26.18. That they may receive forgiveness of
sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified, by faith that is in
me, Act. 13.38, 39. Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of
sins; and by him all that believe are justified: and there is another degree
of justifying Faith, which follows after justification; and remission of
sins; whereby we being persuaded, and in some measure assured of the
remission of our sins, we are justified in the Court of Conscience, this
being an effect of justifying faith. And this may be proved by that Scripture,
he makes use of to prove his declarative justification by Faith, Romans 5.1.
Therefore being justified by Faith, we have peace with God through our Lord
Jesus Christ: The Apostle Ex hoc eti^a leco certissimo a^gumento colligi
potest, justificationem ex sola fide: Id autem constat ex effecto, ad hunc
modum, Id per quod justificamur, opo^ter ut nos pacatos reddat erga Dcum, Pet.
Mar. Com. in loc.
showing that we are justified by Faith alone, in the sight of God; sets down
peace with God; as an effect of justifying Faith: which peace may be called the
assurance of faith, so that you see this declarative justification is no more
but an effect of that faith, without which we cannot be justified before God: if
he had proved by Scripture, that faith is only declarative, in regard of
justification, it had been something: but its altogether against the Word of
God: but to inform us the better, I will set down what justification is:
Justification is an action of God, freely of his own mercy and favor
absolving a believing sinner from the whole curse due to his sins, and
accounting him perfectly just in his fight, unto eternal life in heaven,
through the perfect obedience and sufferings of Christ imputed to his Faith,
unto the everlasting praise and glory of Gods justice, mercy, and truth, Romans
3.24, 25. and chap. 4, 5 and chap. 5.19. 2 Cor. 5.19. Romans 4.4. Now judge by
this, whether a man can be justified by Gods imputation of Christ's
righteousness without Faith, Faith and justification according to Scripture,
being inseparable.

Page 37. He sets down the causes of justification.

First, says he, it is God that justifyeth, Romans 8.33. efficienter, as being
the efficient cause, of our justification.

Secondly, it is the blood of Christ that justifies, Romans 5.9. here is the
material cause of our Justification.

Thirdly, it is Faith that justifies Declaratively: I never read in Divinity
amongst the causes Est certus causarum ordo, nec datur in iis processus in
insinitum, Kekerman, Systemat. Logic-lib. 1. c. 14.
of justification, the declarative cause to be one; never I think, did any man
hear a subject of so great concernment, so lamely handled: especially this
Sermon, as he confesses in his Epistle, being the quintessence of ten years
Sermons: let us see the causes of Justification.

The Causa efficiens justificationis active intellectae, est tota ^S. Triniras,
causa ejus (...) est mera gratta, sive gratui^^s Dei favoricausa (...) est
Christus. (...).
efficient cause of Justification understood actively, is the whole blessed
Trinity. 2 Cor. 5.19. 1 Cor. 6.21. that which inwardly moves God, is the
meeregrace, and free favor of God, Romans 3.14. Ephesians. 2.8. Tit. 3.4, 5. the
outward moving cause, herein, is Christ as God-man, our Mediator, because we
obtain this gift from his merit.

The Causa eius inst^umentalis est verbum evangelii^ justifica tonis passive
sumprae respeclu homini^ qui justificatur, nulla causa est nisi instrumental^,
^des.
isntrumental is the word of the Gospel, Romans 1.16. Justification taken
passively, in respect of man who is justified, there is no cause but
isntrumental, and that is faith alone, which (as Logicians speak) is a
Passive instrument.

The Materia justincationis active sumprae, est Christi satisfactio, qua and
peccatis nostris paenas debitas persolvit, and o bedientiam legi perfectam
praestitir: Materit ejus paslive acceptae, est homo quidem in se miser.
Material cause of Justification, taken actively, is the satisfaction of
Christ: whereby he did undergo the punishment due to our sins, and did
perform perfect obedience to the law; for our Divines generally understand by
Christ's satisfaction, his active and passive obedience: The material cause
taken passively is man in his natural condition.

The Forma ejus active intelle ctae, est totius satisfaction is Christi
imputatio, qua tota quoque nostra est, non secus ac si ipsi eam praestitisemus.
Forma justificationis passive acceptae, est qua credences, fide, velat animae
manu, Christum cum roto merito suo apprehendun^, sibique applicant.
formal, understood actively, is the imputation of the whole satisfaction of
Christ: whereby it is wholly made ours; even as if we our selves in our own
persons had made this satisfaction: Phil. 3.8.9. The formal, being taken
passively, is when men believing, do by faith, which is as the hand of the
Soul, apply unto themselves, and apprehend Christ with all his merits.

The Finis istius beneficii est dei gloria et salus nostra: Welleb. Christ.
Theol. Compend lib. 1. cap. 30.
final, is the glory of God and our Salvation: or if you will take them more
briefly, thus. First, the efficient cause of Justification, is the grace of
God. Secondly, the material is Christ our redeemer. Thirdly, the formal, is
Imputation of our sins to him, and his Justice to us. Fourthly, the
Isntrumental cause is faith within: (which as I said before in the
Instrumentum passivum est, quod in productione effectus sese non commovet.
Kekerm. Syst. log. lib. 1. cap. 15.
Logicians phrase is a passive Instrument) and the Gospel without: Romans 5.9. 1 Timothy 2.6. Fifthly, the final cause, is Gods glory, the utmost, our Salvation
the nearest end thereof. All this while, where is the Declarative cause of
Justification? but he that will go about to coin a new justification never
before heard of, may adventure to make a new cause, never before read of.

Page 37. toward the latter end, he comes to resolve a question: How Children
can be saved, that do not believe. Some say, (says he) by the habit of faith;
some by the faith of their Parents; some say by an unknown way: (he resolves
the Question thus) But I say they are saved the same way that all flesh is
saved, that is saved: that is to say, by the righteousness of Christ imputed:
Grant what he says to be true; Can he prove by any one place of Scripture,
that the righteousness of Christ was ever imputed to any without Faith?
(especially those of riper years) Concerning the Faith of Infants (as our
learned Bishop Ad infantes autem quod attiner, quia peccatores sunt non proprio
actu, sed haereditatio habitu, sufficit quod peccati mortincationem, and fidem
habeant; non proprio actu sese exerentem, sed in habituali principio gratiae
inclusam, Davenant, Com. in Coloss. Cap. 2 page 263.
Davenant says) because they are not sinners by their own proper act, but by
a haereditary habit, it suffices that they have mortification of sin, and
Faith; not manifesting themselves by their own proper act, but included in the
habitual beginning of grace; but that the Spirit of Christ is able and wont to
effect this habitual beginning of grace in them, no man of sound judgment
will deny; Some think Infants have Faith as they have regeneration; that is,
the inclination or seed of Faith.

As touching this present controversy, ( to boleeve) is taken two ways:
Actively, when they which are of years have Faith in Christ by the hearing of
the Word: Passively and by imputation, when for the covenant and Gods promise,
the righteousness of faith is imputed unto Infants.

There is a Infantes fidem non secus ac rationem habent, eisi non in fructu,
tamen in semine and radice, etsi non actu secundo, tamenactu primo, ersi non
operis externademonstratione, tamen Spir. Sinterna virture Wolleb. Christ.
Theol. Compend. page 176.
twofold act of Faith: the first, and the second; That, whereby Faith is; This,
whereby Faith works: Infants have Faith in the first act, not in the second;
in the seed, and not in the harvest; by imputation of justice, not by
operation; by a hidden virtue of the Spirit, and not by outward demonstration:
The diverse circumstances of ages, break not the unity of Faith, and the
nature of the promise, Ephesians. 4.5. one faith, one Lord, one baptism; for the
one and the self same righteousness of Faith is sealed in the parents and in
the Infants.

Infants have faith no otherwise then they have reason; no man can deny but
that Infants have reason, so likewise they have Faith; although not in the
fruit, yet in the seed and root: Is God the God only of men of An Adultorum
Deus tantum? an non et infantum, certe and infantium, non est autem Deus
infidelium. sed tantum fidelium, infantes igitur inter, fideles ponendi sunt
Cassand. de Baptism. Infant. page mihi. 741.
riper years, and not of Infants? certainly of Infants, but he is not the God
of unbeleevers, but of the faithful only; Infants therefore must needs be
accounted amongst the number of believers: That the Kingdom of heaven belongs
to them, and salvation, is plain by the Word of God; but how and after what
manner God reveals himself unto them, is not so fully known to us.

Whereas he says Page 38. at the beginning: That here is the difference, men
of riper years are not only saved, but also know their salvation; children
are saved but know not of it before: To this I answer, that Infants dying in
their Infancy and being saved, there is no question to be made, but God does
make known their salvation to them: The safest way is to leave them to God,
who does and will dispose of them that belong to the election of grace
according to his free Quia salurem aeternam obtinent: here in infan^a mo^^anum,
etiam in utero materno jam vero certum est, neminem salutem aeternam consequi
nisi per fidem: Polan. Syntag. lib. 9. cap. 6. de fide Salvif.
mercy, yet so that none attain salvation without Faith.

Page 39. is this passage, far be it from us to think the duty of a Minister
is discharged by crying out against sin, drunkenness, adultery, and the
rest. To this I answer, What Minister so ignorant, but knows these things must
be done in their order? though this is not all; yet without this a Minister
cannot discharge his duty, this of necessity must be done, Isa. 58.1. Cry
aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a Quasi ruba exalta vocem tuam,
manifesle docendo, hoc enim modo praedicavit Chri^^^s, ut pater in Evangelio:
Lyran. in loc.
Trumpet; and show my people their transgression and the house of Jacob their
sins: it was our Saviors course, that he took in his Ministry; witness
his thundering out so many woes against wicked men, and threatening them with
hell and damnation; but this was spoken in disgraee of those Ministers, who in
their Sermons press the Law of God upon men's consciences: to the end they
might reform their wicked lives, knowing likewise that although the persons of
believers are freed from the condemning power of the Law; yet the Law has a
condemning power over their sins, and sharp rebukes make sound Christians.

Page 39. in the latter end says, he, we must know there is a difference
between a Minister of the Gospel and a moral Philosopher; Is any Minister so
heathenish as to build his Sermons upon Philosophicali maxims; and not upon
canonical Scriptures? We have (as the Apostle calls it, Act. 20.33.) the word
of his grace which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among
all them which are sanctified, we have also a more sure word whereunto ye do
well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place, 2 Pet.
1.19.

Page 39. at the end, and at the beginning of Page 40. there is this passage:
Alas! what profits it to salvation if we have reclaimed men from sin to
virtue, from drunkenness to temperance, not having laid before a sure
foundation; have we brought them any whit nearer the Kingdom of heaven?

To this: I wonder what foundation can be laid in the soul of that man that
lives in sin and drunkenness, and is not reclaimed; sure this rubbish must
first be cast out before. Christ the foundation can be laid: he sets down a
way contrary to Christ's own rule, Matthew 12.29. How can one enter into a
strong man's house and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man?
Sin being the strong man must first be bound and cast out before Christ will
enter; and till we can bring men to reclaim and get power over their
corruptions; no sure foundation can be laid: What communion has light with
darkness, and what concord has Christ with Nullus potest esse consensus
Christo cum Belial, id est cum Diabolo: venit enim Christus ut destruat opera
Diaboli, Estius in loc.
Belial? 2 Cor. 6.14, 15. in preaching against these gross sins we show our
selves Ministers of the Gospel, Titus 2.11, 12, 13. The Grace of God that
brings salvation; teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we
should live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world: but he
concludes; if we have reclaimed men from these sins, they are not any whit
nearer the Kingdom of heaven: Our Savior is of a contrary mind, who said to
the Scribe, Mark. 12.34. Thou art not Longior namque ignorantia est a regno dei
quam scientia^ Hier^nym. in loc. Ideo non fuit long a regno Dei, quia
sententiae illius quae novi Testamenti, and evangelicae perfectionis est
propria, fauror extitisse probatus est: Aquin. aur. caten.
far from the Kingdom of heaven: In regard of his knowledge, his discreet
answer, and that he was a favourer of Christ, he was nearer the Kingdom of
heaven then those that were without that knowledge and respect to Christ which
he had, and lived in more gross sins then he did; and it is probable that Ex
quo judicamus hunc tandem ad numerum credentium accessisse, Aretius, Com in
loc. Parum adhuc abes a vera Dei agnitione, quae progressu tem poris tibi
contingere potest, jam enim quasi in via es: Ac verifimile est hunc Scribam,
post resatrectionem, ad Christum redemptorem suisse conversum; been erga
Christum affectus discessir, and si enim quidam curiositate impulsi,
Evangelicas conciones audiunt, non ut discant, sed ut novi aliquid audiant:
^amen fieri potest ut meliores discedant, and aliquando Christum agnoscant,
quare sic formandae sunt conciones, ut dociles and sanabiles non repellan ut:
Luc. Osiand. in loc.
afterward he did believe, and of nearer came to be within the kingdom of
heaven So men that are by the Ministry of the Word brought to leave their
sins they formerly lived in, may be said to be, and indeed are nearer the
Kingdom of God then those which go on obstinately in their sinful courses.

Page 40. he uses this desperate expression, Nay have we not made them seven
times more the children of hell? when we do by the blessing of God upon our
preaching reclaim men from their former evil life: which is the only way, and
without which we cannot lay a sure foundation; do we by this make them more
the children of hell? this is contrary to Christ's way, Mark. 10.19, 20, 21.
When the man told him, he had observed the Commandments from his youth: Then
Jesus beholding him loved him; Sure he did not count him seven fold more the
child of the Devil for being reclaimed; and there was no sure foundation laid;
our Lord tells him, One thing thou lackest, he was in a fair way to the
Kingdom; but to add venom to his expressions he concludes, Publicans and Har
lots shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven before such as are thus reclaimed:
and leaves it barely without expounding it the meaning is not; such as now
Di^untur igitur publicani and meretrices praecedere sacerdotes in regno Dei,
quia praedicationi Joannis sidem babentus paenitentiam egerunt; Intelliguntur,
ejusmodi publicani and meretrices, non qui tales adhuc sunt: sed qui tales olim
suerunt. Gerbard. Haim. Evang. par. 1. cap. 151. page 834.
are Publicans and Harlots, but those who in times past were such, but now
believe, and repent of their former evil life. For to be Publicans and
sinners, and to enter into heaven is impossible, Matthew. 11.15. It is said the
lame walk, the dease hear; that is, those that were before lame and deaf,
do now walk and hear: So those that were before harlots, are by John's
preaching true penitents and believers. O desperate Doctrine tending to the
undervaluing of sanctification and a holy reformation in the souls of men; and
to the ruinating of Christ's kingly office, who reigns in the hearts of his
people subjecting them, and brings under every high thought, to the obedience
of his will set down in his word: we are not of that mind that Sanctification
is the foundation: but where that is not, there can be no sure foundation.

Page 40. at the end and the beginning of the 41. far be it from us to spend
the time in profane and vain bablings: Sure if his conference between a sick
man and his pastor (as himself confesses in his Epistle to his neighbors of
Pirton) was the substance of ten years Sermons, those must needs be stuffed
with Tautologies, and vain repetitions over and over: The peoples case is to
be pitied, and their patience to be admired who have lived so long time under a
ministry that had so little substance ministering, questions that tend not to
the edifying, but subverting of the hearers. Whereas he says the Schoolmen
spent themselves in frivolous disputations: he does in this betray his own
ignorance of their worth and learning, for we have good experience of the
wholesome use Protestant Divines have made of the School men.

Page 43. at the beginning, he propounds this question, How did John's doctrine
burn and shine more then the Law? I answer (says he) The Law sanctifies to
the purifying of the flesh, Hic locus multis errandi occasionem praebuit quia
non reputabant de Sacramentis tractari, quorum spiritualis est significatio,
carnis emundationem exponumt, quae^antum inter homines (...), ficut prosani
homines habebant sua piacula quibus scelerum infamiam delenent: haec rero
expositio nimis prosana est, nam injuria fit Dei promissionibus si earum
effectum restringineus ad poliuam duntaxat, Calvin in loc.
Heb. 9.13. John's doctrine purifieth the conscience.

To this I answer, This place has reference to Number. 19. The Apostles argument
is from the lesser, and the argument runs thus: If the ashes of an Heifer
sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh, how much
more shall the blood of Christ purge your consciences? etc. This ashes did
sanctify the unclean, to the purifying of the flesh, because those who for
their outward uncleanness, were excluded from the Congregation, by the
sprinkling of the water of cleansing were ceremonially made clean so that it
was lawful for them to come to the Sanctuary of the Lord: Not for that this
purifying did only extend it self to the flesh, and was merely carnal, for
then the people of the Jews should no whit differ from the heathens: who had
their sacrifices merely carnal; by which they might blot out the infamy of
their heinous crimes: And to expound this place as he does, is (in Calvin's
phrase) an exposition too much profane: If their daily sacrifices did not
prefigure the Messiah, and were not done out of spiritual respects, what was
their Temple, but a Butchers shambles? In this that the Law sanctifyeth to the
purifying of the flesh, there was a spiritual signification: for as the
outward uncleanness did admonish the people of their inward impurity before
God; so the sprinkling by the water of separation, and the receiving of those
that were sprinkled, into the congregation, did signify to believers their
spiritual sprinkling, and cleansing by the blood of Christ, by which alone
there is a way laid wide open for sinners to come into the sight of God; and
with boldness to have access to the Throne of Grace. To limit therefore, and
bound the legal rites only to the purifying of the flesh, (as he does by his
false exposition) and to restrain the effect of them only to civil and
politic Government, is injurious to the promises of God, made to his people,
who lived in the time of the Law. Sacraments and signs have a spiritual
signification, so that this purifying of the flesh by the water of separation,
(so called because such as were separated for any uncleanness were sprinkled
with it) did signify unto the people of the Jews, the purifying of the
conscience by the blood of Christ; now then join the Nihil extra usum habere
rationem Sacramenti, and ad usum oportere ac^edere fide: unde tum in veteri,
tum in novo Testamento extra illum usum, Sacramenta nobis inania esse dicuntur.
Tossan. ad Hebraeos praelect. cap. 10.
sign, and the thing signified together, and the Law sanctifyeth to the
purifying of the conscience. Whereas he says, Secondly, the Law perfects
nothing as pertaining to the Conscience, Heb. 10.1. but John's doctrine is a
perfecting doctrine, insomuch that believers herein have no more conscience of
sins.

To this, let us see the meaning of the Apostle, Heb. 10.1. in this place he
speaks Non hic agi proprie de Sacramentis, sed de toto tabernaculo, and
sacerdotio Levitico: Demde vocari umbras ritus externos, non simpliciter, sed
quatenus opponuntur Christo, in quo est veritas; and ad quem in tecto usu
respicientes Patres, eundem cibum spiritualem comederunt nobiscum and vere
justificati sunt, Tossan. ibid.
not properly concerning the Sacraments, but of the whole Tabernacle and
Leviticall Priesthood: Again, these external rites are called shadows not
simply, but as they are opposed to Christ, in whom is the Truth, and to whom
the Fathers looking, in the right use of them, did eat the same spiritual
meat with us; and were truly justified in the sight of God. The Law, you will
say, perfects nothing: The meaning is, the unbeleeving Jews cleaving to the
Ceremonies and external rites, and looking ( ex opere operato) that is, from
the work done to be justified by them without Christ; and thus considered,
they are, as Gal. 4.9. Weak and beggarly Egena autem elementa Apostolus ad
Gal. appellat ceremonias, respectu Judaeorum, qui excluso Christo per illas,
justificari volebant, Tossan. ibid.
elements: The Apostle here does in few words most excellently set forth unto
us the difference and agreement of the Old and New Testament, of the Law and
Gospel, of the Doctrine and Sacraments of both; The agreement consists in
this, the Old as well as the New had Christ with his own oblation of himself,
and eternal redemption: Again, of both Testaments, in regard of the Utriusque
enim Testamenti quoad substantiam, ut unus est Deus, ita unus Mediator, una
Ecclesia, una fides, una salus, Pareils in loc.
substance; as there is one God, so there is one Mediator, one Church, one
Faith, one Salvation: The Doctrine of the Old did lead to Christ: The
Sacraments and ceremonies did show and point at Christ: whom the Doctrine of
the Gospel, and our Sacraments do declare to us. The difference is in this:
They did represent Christ to the Fathers more obscurely, and darkly: these do
more clearly set him forth to us; to conclude this, The Law then considered,
not in opposition, but in reference to Christ, did perfect something pertaining
to the Conscience.

In that the Apostle says the worshippers once purged, should have had no more
conscience of sins: By Nam etiam per hoc semel purga is non tollitur omnis
peccatorum conscientia, quandoquidem etiam sanguine Christi justificati nondum
in hac vita efficimur (...), sed perpetuo manemus multorum peccato rum nobis
conscii, Pareus com. in loc.
conscience is meant the guilt of sin; from which our consciences once purged
by the blood of Christ, and our hearts purified by faith: There is no
condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus: although all conscience of sin
is not taken away; which men justified and purged by the blood of Christ, out
of humane frailty daily do commit. And we do remain sinners, but by the
blood of Christ, the guilt of all our sins is blotted out; though in regard
of the filth, and the many falls we have, our consciences are many times
afflicted, and we do continually remain conscious to our selves of many
sins. And believers in the time of the Law, by their Sacrifices, which they
were commanded of God to offer, were put in mind of the blood of Christ, which
by faith they did apply to their Consciences, and were thereby freed from the
guilt of sin; and so had no more conscience of sins: their Consciences
being by faith sprinkled with the blood of Christ, as well as our Consciences
who live now in the time of the Gospel. To conclude, we must distinguish
between Ceremonies merely legal, and rites, to which the promise of grace was
annexed. And those rites are to be considered either before the coming of
Christ, or after: Before his coming they were commanded of God, and
profitable: Afterward the body being present, they are unprofitable and of no
use: Again they are considered as they were in thmeselves, and as they were in
regard of their typical signification: considered in their own nature and (
ex opere operato) from the work done; without faith in those that used them,
they had no spiritual effect: Notwithstanding to believers, they were the
exercise, and sealing of faith, in the Messiah to come, whom in regard of their
typical signification they did prefigure: when the Law Heb. 10. Lex dicitur
umbram habuisse non ipsam rerum imaginem, nec potuisse accedentes perfectos
facere, non portuisse auferre peccata and mundare conscientiam; and Deum
hostias and oblationes noluisse, nec ei placuisse: quod intelligi debet
inordine ad justificatione^, ex opere operato; na^ alioquin negari non potest,
quin ei placut rint ex obedientia, and devotione offerentis; nam vocanntr odor
suavissimus, Gerhard locor. tom. 4. col. mihi. 302.
( Heb. 10.1.8.) is said, not to make the comers thereunto perfect; and not to
take away the conscience of sins; or to purge the conscience: and that
Sacrifices and offerings he would not, neither had pleasure therein: God in the
Law did command them, Levit. 1.2, 3, 4. and they were oftentimes a sweet
savor unto him: but this place is to be understood in order to justification
from the works done: God approving of them as they were done in faith as
Types, until the coming of the Messiah: but he could not away with them, when
they were done without faith: and when men looked for Justification by the bare
external performance of them.

Whereas Page 43. he says John's Doctrine is the bringing in of a better hope,
Adhuc enim in eo verfatur auctor hujus Epistolae, ut doceat Loviticum
Sacetdorium, posteriore abrogatum: neque de prioris usu vel ullum adhuc verbum
fecit. Beza in loc.
Heb. 7.19. the meaning of this place may be understood by what has been said
before. Mark the opposition. The Apostle speaks to those who looked for
perfection by the Law in opposition to Christ; and did hold to the shadows of
the Law after the coming of Christ he compares Christ's Priesthood and the
Levitical together, showing the perfection of the one above the other, speaking
here of the Leviticall Priesthood abrogated; and not of the former use of it:
and out of question, for substance, the Fathers had the same hope with us
(neither better nor worse) of eternal life; Bellar. Tom. 3. de Sacrament.
Contr. 1.
Bellarmin would have the Law to have had only unprofitable Ceremonies, from
which he labors to prove that the Fathers could not be justified; and received
into Heaven before Christ's coming in the flesh: The Caeremomae (...) perfe
crant mutiles, sed superinducta in eis spes Missue, non sui^ses man is, por
fidemenim in Chustiun ve^mrum, justificabantur; ut nos per fidem in Christum
exhibitum, Tossan. in loc.
Ceremonies by themselves, were unprofitable; but the hope of the Messiah
shadowed in them was not a vain thing: for the fathers were justified by faith
in Christ to come; as we are by faith in Christ exhibited.

Page 43. We will consider (says he) the difference of that repentance which
was taught by the Prophets from that repentance which was taught by John.
First, for the repentance preached by the Prephets there is a Definition of
repentance, which is reprehended by some; and justly, as coming short of that
repentance which is preached under the Gospel; it is this, to bewail sins
that we have committed or emitted, to for sake those that we have bewailed:
This definition seems to me to express to the full, that repentance which
was taught by the Prophets: these are his words at the beginning of page 44.
let us look a little into them: this definition is given by the Paenitere est
ante acta peccata de flere, and flenda non committere Magist lib 4. did. 14.
Master of the Sentences: but mark his words, he says this definition is
justly to be reprehended, and yet it seems to him (as he says) to express to
the full that repentance which was taught by the Prophets: Now judge whether
the Prophets taught such a repentance as may upon any terms be justly
reprehended: Did not these holy men of God speak as they were moved by the
holy Ghost? 2 Pet. 1.21. What will follow then, but that he does in plain
terms affirm that the Holy Ghost may justly be reprehended? Oh blasphemy! but
let us see how the repentance the Prophets taught, and John's repentance differ;
how John's repentance was more then the Prophets, how John's goes one step
higher. He sets down John's repentance to be this, Luke 3.3. The baptism of
repentance for remission (for his appeal) whether it be not better rendered
unto remission of sins, then for remission of sins: I let it pass as not
worth the while; did not the Prophets preach the washing of repentance for
remission of sins? neither did they place repentance in the external
washing, but in the inward purifying of the heart by Faith, Continuo praedicat
paenitentiam and conversionem ad Dominum. Pelican. in loc.
Jer. 4.14. O Jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou may be
saved.

The question will be whether the repentance John preached was a Quid novi
ergo? a novo hoc allatum doctorevel protangelo? Sane doctrinam si spectes ipsam
resipiscentiae, quae apud propheras nominatur, recessus a malo, and reditus ad
meliora, and (...), five reditus est quidam ad Deam, quem a nobis peccata
nostra se junxetant: eadem est Joannis quae et Mosis er aliorum propherarun,
seria ad conversionem exhortatio: Pelarg. quae. Evang in ca. 3. Mart. quae. 2.
new repentance, and different from that repentance which was preached by Moses
and the Prophers, it was Moses his whole study how he might bring the
Israelites to true repentance; and this is evident in the ninth and tenth
Chapters of Deuteronomie: And how often; nay continually did the Prophets call
upon the people to repent, witness these Scriptures: Isa. 45.22. Jer. 14.22.
Ezekiel. 18.30. Hose. 14.1. Joel 2.12. Therefore also now says the Lord, Turn
ye even to me with all your heart: what repentance could John preach more then
this? Certainly John's and theirs was one and the same Doctrine of repentance:
there was a difference in the manner of preaching; but the doctrine was the
same: Repentance is a conversion or turning: Now every conversion is conversant
between two terms: The one is called the term from which, the other to which:
And so in repentance, that from which, is our sins and evil life, from the
consideration whereof arises grief and forrow, and contrition: That to which,
is God, toward whom the contrite and drooping heart does lift and raise up it
self in confidence of mercy promised, and by believing the remission of sins
for Christ his sake the Mediator; from which it is manifest, that contrition
and faith are two proper essential parts of repentance, Act. 14.15. And preach
unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God: How can
we turn to God but by Faith? Act. 20.21. Testifying both to the Jews and also
to the Gentiles repentance toward God, and Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ:
was not Cum autem paenuentia seu conversio ad Deum tres parts continear,
con^ritionem, fidem, and novam obedientiam, Meluct. part. 3. page mihi. 99.
contrition and Faith two essential parts of that repentance Moses and the
Prophets preached, and new obedience a consequent? What could John's repentance
be more then this? how could the repentance he preached go one step higher?
That had Faith to go to Christ, and higher John's could not go: But John makes
low the Mountains: did not the Prophets? John cuts off legal praeregatives:
did not the Prophets by their preaching repentance do so? did they not drive
men from resting in outward Caeremoniae externaea Deo institutae, quamvis
pertineant ad Dei landem and honorem; neque per se tamen, neque in comparatione
ad piam orationem laudis, sunt Deo gra^ae: Ames. in. loc. docum. 31.
performances, and in the work done? Psalm. 51.16, 17. For thou desire not
sacrifie, else would I give it; thou delightest not in burnt offering: The
Sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart o God thou will not despise. John brings down every high thought that exalts it self
against God: did not the Prophets do so? Jer. 4.14. How long shall thy vain
thoughts lodge within thee? Psalm. 139.23, 24. Search me O God and know my
heart: try me and know my thoughts, and see if there be any wicked way in me,
etc. You see here must not be a thought left to exalt it self against God: It
is blasphemy to lay such a charge upon the Prophets Doctrine: For if they did
not by it labor to bring down every high thought that did exalt it self
against God; their doctrine must needs cause them which were guided by it to
come short of the glory of God, which no man that understands himself dare
affirm.

Page 48. he has this passage I have observed some to confine repentance,
within the bounds of our conversation; and make no difference between the
repentance which was taught by the Prophets, and that repentance which was
taught by the Son of God and his Ministers: What he means by the bounds of our
conversation he sets down himself, pa. 49. li. 9. where he opposes
conversation to conscience: The difference then which he makes between the
repentance taught by the Prophets, and that which was taught by the Son of God
and his Ministers, is this; namely, that the Prophets repentance, was confined
within the bounds of men's conversation, and did not extend it self to the
conscience, but only to their outward carriages and behaviors: This must needs
be an hypocritical repentance, clean contrary to that which the Prophets
preached, which did as nearly concern the conscience as the conversation; and
in preaching of it they principally aimed at the conscience, and the inner man;
without which, outward performances were as nothing: and the outward
conversation no whit acceptable to God, who looks at the heart: I dare affirm
that the repentance which the Prophets preached was acceptable to God; not
bounded within the conversation; but extending it self to the conscience;
witness, Loquitur primum de interiore conversione ut animum renovent; si enim
sons fuerit infectus, paenitentia nulla crit, sed hypocrisis Lavat in Ezech.
18. hom. 82.
Ezekiel. 18.30, 31. Repent and turn your selves from all your transgressions,
and make you a new heart and a new Spirit: And it is plain that the doctrine
of repentance taught by the Prophets and by the Son of God and his Ministers,
is for sum and substance one and the same: And thus to charge the Prophets
doctrine with hypocrisy, is false doctrine in a high degree. And this does
further appear, in that he makes their repentance to be (...), rather then
(...); for then the repentance taught by the Prophets should not differ from
Judas his repentance, which was without Faith: which makes the difference
between the repentance of Godly, and wicked men.

Page 48. at the latter end (he says) It is a doctrine often heard of in your
Pulpits: That repentance does wash away sin: And Page 49. in the latter end
he has these words: To preach that tears do wash away sins out of the
sight of God which (says he) I have heard some testify that they have heard
preached) is a blaspemy against the blood of Christ: It is very uncivil to
charge blasphemy upon any Minister in public, and not to bring his accusers
first to him in private; they it may be through ignorance may mis-understand;
and I question not but if the Minister might be named, he would maintain what
he had preached: But grant it to be true that some have preached, That
repentance washes away sin; And that tears do wash away sins out of the
sight of God; it is blasphemy to say this is blasphemy, for it is no other then
the Scripture phrase, Exhortationis an em fumma est, primum seria resipiscentia
abslinens a malo; Junius in loc. Hortatur Judaeos ad paenitentiam Call vin. in
loc.
Isa. 1.16. Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from
before mine eyes; by washing in this place is meant serious and true
repentance, for the Prophet does exhort the Jews thereunto: and by washing
here is not to be understood the washing of the pollutions of the bodies of
men, but of their sins: By [make you cleane] is not meant the cleanness of
their hands, but of their life and conversation: The Apostle James has the
like phrase Chap. 4.8, 9. Ipsa salutaris paenitentia ac vera refipiscentia per
lotionem and mundationem exprinitur: ut Isa. 1.16. Atque earenus hoc in loco
Jacobus: Mundate, adhortans scil. cos ad veram seriamque paenitentiam, vitaeque
pravae emendationem: Laurentius, Com. in loc.
Cleanse your hands you sinners, and purify your hearts you double minded: By
cleansing and washing is meant true repentance, as in Isa. 1.16. by hands we
are to understand our sinful actions, and by hearts our corrupt affections;
Now how should our hearts, and hands be cleansed and washed from sin? the
Apostle bids us be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; by weeping is meant tears
of repentance: So that to say, tears of repentance do wash away sins in the
sight of God, (which is all one with the words of the Prophet Esaias, put away
the evil of your doings from before mine eyes) is warranted by these two
places of Scripture compared together: It is no blasphemy then to speak as the
Scripture speaks; This saying has been used often amongst some of the
Ancient; and had it been blasphemy, some Council or other, in all this time,
would have condemned them for it. Saint Flevit ergo amatissime Petrus, flevit
ut lachrymis suum posser lavare delictum. and tust veniam vis mereri, dilue
culpam lachrymis tuam. Ambr. lib. 10. in Luc. cap 22 col. mihi. 216.
Ambrose upon these words [Peter went out and wept bitterly] has this passage:
Peter therefore wept bitterly, he wept that he might with tears wash away his
sin: If thou will obtain pardon, wash away thy offense with tears; thus the
Father. Tria sunt genera Baptismi. quorum primum, quo sordes peccatorum per
regenerationis lavacrum abluuntur.

Secondum quo quis sanguine suo per Martyrium baptizatur.

Est autemtertium baptisina lachrymarum. Isidor. de offic. eccle. lib. cap. 22.
sol. mihi. 411.


Isidor Hispalensis who lived a thousand years ago, says there are three
kinds of baptism or washing: The first whereby the defilements of sin are
washed away by the laver of regeneration: The second when one is baptized in
his own blood by Martyrdom, with which baptism Christ was like wise
baptized: The third is the baptism or washing of tears. To preach then that
tears of repentance wash away sin is no new Doctrine, and is not injurious to,
but does magnify the blood of Christ: Tears being an effect flowing from the
conscience sprinkled with the blood of Christ; Musculus upon the first of Esaias
propounds this question: How the Prophet exhorts men to wash and cleanse
themselves, seeing it is not in their power. And 1 John 1. The blood of Jesus
Christ washes us from all sin: He answers it thus: That this Hujusmodi
resipiscentia, causa est repurgationis, non per quam, sed sine qua non: Muscul,
com in loc.
repentance here required, is the cause of our washing or cleansing, not the
cause by which, but the cause without which our sins cannot be washed away:
And they are said to wash away our sins, not considered in Non in reipsa and
intrinseca bonitate actus, sed in divina acceptatione, pactione, and
ordinatione, Cassand. Ep. 19 page mihi. 1110.
themselves or in regard of intrinsecall goodness in the Act of shedding them;
but in regard of Gods acceptance who does in and through Christ accept of
them, in regard of Gods covenant and promise, in regard of his ordination, who
has ordained that such as shall be saved shall weep for their sins: There
is a washing of Sanctification and Regeneration, as well as to Justification:
By true repentance these benefits do redound of believers.

First, remission of sins, Mark 1.4. John did preach the baptism of
repentance for the remission of sins: Thus while he intitles his book [
John's doctrine] he labors as much as in him lies, to overthrow John's
Doctrine, Act. 3.19. Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may
be blotted out.

Secondly, the favor of God, Luke 4.18. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
because he has anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor; he has sent
me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the Captives, and
recovering of sight to the blind: to set at liberty those that are bruised; to
preach the acceptable year of the Lord: Luke 15.7. Joy shall be in heaven
over one sinner that repents: as you may see in the parable of the Prodigal.

The third benefit is righteousness before God, Luke 18.14. The Publican
bewailing his condition, in true repentance, our Lord says, he went down to
his house justified rather than the other: by [ Uterque descendit domum, sed
impari fructu, Publicanus vere justificatus, Pharisaeus coram hominibus ranrum,
Areti. in loc.
rather] is meant, the Publican was truly justified; the Pharisee before men
only: The Publican in the sight of God: they had both their Righteousness,
the one hypocritical, the other real, who was justified of God: So that
[rather] must not be understood of one and the same Righteousness, as though
the difference consisted only in this: That the Publican was more justified,
the Pharisee less: the Pharisee, he justified himself before men
hypocritically; the other was justified of God, which is much rather to be
chosen.

Fourthly, The gift and inhabitation of the Holy Ghost, Act. 2.38. Repent and
be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of
sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

Fifthly, The hearing of our prayers, 1 John 3.21, 22. If our heart condemn us
not, then we have confidence toward God. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of
him.

The Sixth, is Salvation and life eternal, Act. 11.18. Then has God also to
the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.

The seventh, is Freedom from temporal punishments, or to be sure, a
mitigation of them, Jonah 3.10. And God saw their works, that they turned from
their evil ways, and God repented of the evil that he had said, 2 Chronicles.
12.12. And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord turned from him,
that he would not destroy him altogether.

This is contrary to what he taught on a Fast day, (as I was credibly informed)
That we did not Fast and humble our selves, for the turning away of Gods
Judgments: Look well upon these particulars, and consider the places of
Scripture, and you shall find it no blasphemy to say, repentance washes away
sin; Now let us see how all these benefits are attributed to repentance; and
how they may be said to be the fruits of it? Not Observandum est paenitentiae
haec tribui, non ratione contritionis, quasi illa sit meritum quoddam, ac causa
remissionis peccatorum; sed ratione hdei, quae est essentialis pars
paenitentiae. Quod ergo partis and quidem primatiae, pro prium est; illud
usitata Scripturae phrasi, toti tribuitur, Gerhard, locor. Tom. 3. col. mihi.
428.
in regard of contrition, as if that were a certain merit and cause of
remission of sins, I mean the meritorious cause (though, as I said, it is
Causa sine qua non:) the cause without which we cannot receive them: but in
regard of Faith, which is an essential part of repentance, which does
apprehend Christ, and in Christ does freely receive the grace of God; remission
of sins, righteousness, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and life eternal: That
therefore, which is proper to a part, it being the principal part; That is by
the usual phrase of Scripture, attributed to the whole; Especially, when as
true and saving Faith, and true contrition, and the study of new obedience are
inseparably joined together: I hope then we may use Scripture phrase without
blasphemy.

Page 49. The latter end (he says) This doctrine works hideous effects in the
Church of God; The simple people being asked, how they think to make
satisfaction to God for sin: have answered, by lamenting and amending. Are not
these simple people, those that have lived the ten years under his Ministry?
they are simple indeed: Ask a Child that can say the Church Catechism (which
in teaching repentance, tells us, We must have a lively Faith in Gods mercy
through Christ, with a thankful remembrance of his death) and he will tell
you; he hopes to make satisfaction by the merits of Jesus Christ. We do not
teach Idololatrica est paenite^tia papistarum, quam ponunt, 1. in contritione,
2. in confessione, 3 satisfactione, quaque peccata expiari putant, Wolleb.
Compend. Theol. lib. 2, cap. 3. p. 291.
repentance consists, first, in contrition; secondly confession; thirdly,
satisfaction; whereby our sins are expiated.

Page 50. At the beginning, he goes on thus: God people, it is dying, not
crying, will give satisfaction for sins.

I answer, did Christ's dying exclude his crying? who as the Apostle says, Heb.
5.7. In the days of his flesh, when he had offered up Prayers and
supplications with strong crying and tears. Was this crying, and these tears,
excluded in point of satisfaction for sins? Again, we do not say that tears
of repentance, make or give satisfaction, but this satisfaction of Christ, is
given to no man but to him in whom are tears of repentance, and crying tears
in true repentance; is dying to sin: else what becomes of Christian
mortification? and therefore this crying is dying: We make not tears the
cause, but an effect flowing from the satisfaction of Christ: (by Faith applied
to the soul) Zach. 12.10. And they shall Quis enim vere fidelium non plangit?
peccatis suiscausam se dedisse occisioni and crucifixioni Christi hlii Dei and
hominis, ideoque amarissime semper pii Judaei and gentes Domini passionem
plangunt, Pelican in loc.
look upon him whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him. They
that by Faith look at Christ crucified for their sins, cannot but shed tears
of repentance.

Page 50. At the latter end, he propounds this question: Did not the Prophets
also Preach remission of sins upon true repentance? If we should hold him close
to his own phrase of speech strictly taken, as he does others; we may conclude
out of his own mouth (To preach remission of sins upon true repentance) that
he speaks blasphemy against the blood of Christ; without which there is no
remission; for as satisfaction, so remission of sins is only by the blood of
Christ: but of this by the way. He goes on in these words: I answer, the
Prophets must be considered, preaching either the New Covenant or the Old, for
they preached the New also, (They did never Preach the Old and New Covenant in
opposition to one another;) The Law (says he) did not, could not disanull the
Covenant that was made to Abraham 430. years before: (this place overthrowes
and confutes him to his face) and he alleges it against himself: In the new
Covenant (says he) the Prophets preached eternal remission; in the Old, they
preached actual remission by legal services; but not eternal, which
remission is called by the Apostle a fleshly purifying: This place concerning
the Covenant made to Abraham Conjungi and misccri nulla ratione queunt: quod
non ita est a cipiendum quasi doctrina legis and doctrina Evangel^i mutuo
repugnent: ita enim Dous sibi in suo verbo repugnater; (quod absit, sed quod
justihcationis modus in lege and Evangelio monstratus contratie se haber, aut
ut nec simul stare, anc misceri in unum possunt, magis quam aqua and ignis
simul consistere in unum elemontum possunt, Pareus com. in loc.
Gal. 3.17. is not so to be understood, as if the Doctrine of the Law and of
the Gospel were mutually repugnant, and contrary to each other: for so God
should be repungant and contrary to himself in his own Word; (which God
forbid in the least thought) but in regard of the manner of justification, set
forth in the Law, and in the Gospel: So they are contrary, and cannot be mixed
together, be made one, or stand together, no more than fire and water can
consist together, or be made one and the same element. We must here again
mark the opposition between the Law and the promise, The false Apostles did
attribute the effect of Proinde alrius quiddam in caeremoniis considerat, nempe
effectum justincationis, quem illis tribuchant pseudoapostol^ and
conscientiarum obligationem, Calvin in loc.
Justification to legal ceremonies, and so did lay a yoke upon men's
consciences, the yoke of ceremonies: but what is the meaning of the Apostle when
he says; The Law cannot disanull, and make the promise of none effect? why,
the Impostors did deny salvation promised, to be freely given to men and
obtained by Faith, and did urge the Ceremonies of the Law, as necessary cessary
for the obtaining thereof. And so did set the Law in opposition to the Promise
to disanull it, which the Apostle affirms cannot be; well then, the Law did
not, nor could not disanull the promise made to Abraham, but the false Apostles
in Paul's time would have had it so: And the Prophets should have been no less
than false prophets, if they had Preached the Old Covenant in opposition to the
New: And whereas he says, They did in the Old Covenant, Preach Actual
remission by legal scrvices, but not eternal: now he sets down what he
means by actual remission, (namely) a fleshly purifying: for (so he says)
the Apostle calls it. First, I answer, that where there is actual remission of
sins in the sight of God, there must needs be eternal: Otherwise a man may be
a Child of God to day, and to morrow a castaway; which is Arminianisme in the
highest degree, if not Popery: and contrary to what himself has delivered (to
wit) that God has pardoned all the sins of believers, past, present, and to
come; I would see, how he can prove this actual remission, by legal services;
The Scripture makes mention of no such remission; And the Prophets did Preach
against remission by legal services, consisting only in a fleshly purifying:
nay they did abhor, and cry down the legal services of the people, when
they did perform them to the purifying of the flesh, not having respect to the
inward purifying of the heart by Faith, Isa. 1.11, 12. To what purpose is the
multitude of your sacrifices unto me? says the Lord I am full of the burnt
offerings of Rams, and the fat of fed beasts, I delight not in the blood of
Bullockes or of Lambs or of He Goats, ver. 13. Bring no more vain
oblations, incense is an abomination unto me: by this place you may see the
Prophet Preached against legal services, as restrained to the purification of
the flesh only; and did by them press the people to look farther, to wit, to
the spiritual purification, as ver. 16. Wash ye, make you clean, etc. They
did not preach in the old Covenant actual remission by legal services, but in
reference to Christ, else they should stand guilty of that which the Apostle
speaks, Romans 9.31, 32. But Israel which followed after the Law of
righteousness, has not attained to the Law of righteousness: wherefore?
because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law.
Certainly the Prophets never preached any righteousness or remission by
legal services, unless they were done in faith: and that by them the people
did look at the righteousness of faith: aiming altogether at Jesus Christ: in
whom, and by whom, there was, and ever is eternal remission: who was, Quia ut
primum caepit humani generis reparatio per justificationem hominum in Christo,
caepit Agni illius sanguis operari, Estius in diffic. Script. loc.
Revel. 13.8. The Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the World.

But let us see what actual remission, which he calls a fleshly purifying, is:
Why it is this: when any of the people had outwardly defiled their bodies by
touching any unclean thing: as for one, the touching of a dead body: they were
to be excluded the congregation: now by some legal service, this uncleanness
was remitted, namely by the act of sprinkling the water of separation: and by
this they had actual remission of their uncleanness, which gave them
admission into the Congregation again: The Prophets never had any Commission
to preach the old Covenant, separated and apart from the New: neither is this
actual remission by legal services set down but in reference to eternal
remission by Christ: neither did the Prophets ever preach it otherwise: for if
they had, they had Preached Justification by works, and the righteousness of
the Law, and so they and their hearers must needs come short of the
righteousness of God which is by Faith, and so perish everlastingly: Oh damned
Doctrine!

Page 51. About the middle, To make these things more plain (says he) Take
this proposition: which I know will tingle in the ears of many) happily it may
tingle in his own ears, for it is pity but he should hear of it: his
proposition is this: The knowledge of both actual and eternal remission was
no Article of the Jewish Creed: but a part of that mystery which was kept
secret from the giving of the Law, until the time of John Baptist: his meaning
is, that all that time, the Jews had not knowledge of actual and eternal
remission, as he lays it down, page 52. line 17. his reason is, They differed
nothing from servants, so line the 20. he concludes, they were in bondage, and
being so, had not knowledge of actual and eternal remission. Mark, and see
if he does not contradict his own proposition: page 51. line 6. he says, in
the New Covenant the Prophet Preached eternal remission: why, then he had
knowledge of it, and by Preaching made it known to others: So then they had
knowledge of that before the time of John Baptist, as himself confesses.
Again, he confesses, They Preached actual remission by legal services.
Again, look, Page 53. line 3. he confesses, They had knowledge of actual
remission to come by the promised seed: And herein he contradicts himself, in
saying, It was a part of that mystery, kept secret from the giving of the Law,
until the time of John Baptist. For then they could not have known it to
come. Scientia est habitus demo^strativus, Aristot. 6. Ethic.
Knowledge is a Demonstrative habit, and does determine the Intellect to one
side with certainty. No question but the Jews had so much knowledge whereby
they did certainly and assuredly believe, and were persuaded, and did
understand that their sins were really, actually, and eternally remitted in
Christ. By his actual remission to come, does he understand Christ's actual
coming in the flesh: we must know that all true believers, who lived before
Christ's coming in the flesh, had actual and eternal remission, without which
they could not be saved, nor enter into Heaven: He was up with Patres sub lege
non fuisse consortes aetornae vitae, Osiand. Epit. hist. eccle. Cent. 16. lib,
2. cap. 21.
Servetus in his Sermon, but makes no mention of him in Print: This Heretic
held that the Fathers under the Law were not partakers of eternal life, and
according to his proposition, this heretic speaks the truth.

To prove this proposition he brings in this place of Scripture, Joh. 1.18. No
man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the
bosom of the Father, he has declared him: Will he prove by this place that
none of the Fathers and people of the Jews did see God, in regard of Actual
and eternal remission, before Christ's coming in the flesh? Remission of
sins is an Article of our Faith: And did not they believe the same remission
of sins which we do? To make things plain, I will here set down what
remission of sins is.

Remission of sins, is forgiveness of sin, when both the guilt and punishment
are freely pardoned for Christ alone to such as believe in him: Now if the
Fathers did believe eternal remission, they must needs know it; For in true
saving Faith there are three things Forma fidei docendi causa tribus partibus
describi folet, Notiria, Assensu, and fiducia, 1. Notiria est little cognitio
quae ad sa^utem necessaria sunt, 2. Assensus est quo firmiter credirut vera
esse, quae verbo Dei traduntur, 3. hiducia est qua quisque fidelium fibi
promissiones Evangelicas applicat. Wolleb. Theol. compend. lib. 1. cap. 29.
page 231.
required, Knowledge, Assent, and Application. By Knowledge I mean the right
conceiving of the necessary Doctrines of true Religion, especially those which
concern Christ our Redeemer: Assent is when a man knowing this Doctrine, does
further approve of the same as whole some doctrine; and the Truth of God
directing us aright unto salvation. Application is, when we conceive in our
hearts a true persuasion of Gods mercy toward us particularly in the free
pardon of all our sins, and for the salvation of our Souls; The Jews living
in the time of the Law, having true saving Faith, must needs then have
knowledge of Actual and eternal remission, having these three things which
must needs be in all that did ever truly believe: but it is proved by
Scripture, Act. 10.43. To him give all the Prophets witness, that through his
Name whosoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins. Three things
observable in the Text.

First, That it is the proper Office of Christ by blotting out their sins to
reconcile men to God.

Secondly, That by Faith we obtain remission of sins.

Thirdly, That this Quod haec doctrina non nova, aut nuper fabricata sit, sed
jam olim ab ultimis seculis, testes habuerit omnes Dei Prophetas, Calvin in loc.
Doctrine of remission is no new Doctrine lately framed: But of old from the
beginnings of the world, had all the Prophets of God witnesses to it, and
therefore they must of necessity know it. But we will open the meaning of this
place, Joh. 1.18. No man has seen God at any time, etc. God is said to be
seen in Scripture diverse ways.

First, he is Plures modi sunt videndi Deum, 1. primus. quo non in se sed in
operibus suis videtur. 2. Altera vi^io est qua Deus in aliqua specie and
corporea figura videtur: 3. Tertia est qua videtur per fidem, vel aliquod lumen
spirituale revelatum, and sine specie and imagine ulla. 4. Quarta qua videtur
per humanitarem assumptam: qui enim Christum hominem vid ebant, Deum dicebantur
videre; qui erat unitus illi humanitati. 5. Quinta est omnium suprema qua Deus
in suamet essentia aperte and clare videtur, sicut homo hominem vider: haec est
visio beatorum, quae est visio Dei, in essentia and substantia propria, Tolet
in Evang. Joan. cap. 1. Annot. 53.

Quod Deum nemo vidit un quam praeter Christum testem oculatum, in fallibilis
est sententia: plures modi suut videndi Deum: 1. Per speculum creatutarum: 2.
Per simulachra and imagines: 3. Per Angelos: 4. Per fidem: 5. Per carnem;
concluditur and non videri ipsum, nempe per essentiam, and videri tamen per
apparitiones, perque modos alios; Pelargus, in loc. quae. 2.


seen not in himself, but in his works, in the creatures; for in them many of
the perfections of God are known; as his wisdom, prudence, virtue,
immortality and eternity, Romans 1.20, 21. Again, God is said to be seen in
some bodily shape and likeness, and that either in regard of the outward
sense, or in regard of the imagination; for sometimes God used some likeness
in which he would appear to men; whether it were the likeness of a man, or
of fire, or of any other body, or creature whatsoever, and in regard of this
vision God is said to be seen in the old Testament of the Prophets not only
with the inward, but with the outward eyes, Isa. 6.1. Genesis 32.30. Thirdly, God
is said to be seen by Faith alone without any likeness. Fourthly, by his
humane nature assumed, his flesh; for they which see Christ man are said to see
God united to his humanity, John 14.9. He that has seen me has seen the
Father. Fifthly, God is said to be seen in his own essence, manifestly and
plainly, as one man sees another; and thus he is seen by the intellect, or
understanding; not by the eye of the body, because God is a Spirit: This is the
vision of the blessed in heaven which is spoken of Matthew. 18.10. In heaven
their Angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven, 1
Cor. 13.12. Now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face: And thus
it is concluded, no man has seen God at any time, in regard of his essence,
and being, and proper substance as he is in himself; as an eye witness but
Christ: There is a Comprehensio duobus modis sumitur, Primo, pro consecutione
alicujus rei quam quis desiderat: hoc modo omnes beati in caelis dicuntur
comprehensores, quia jam confecuti sunt; quod in hac vita quaerebant. Secundo,
pro perfecta and adaequata cognitione alicujus rei: Becan. Tom. 1. de vis. Dei
quae. 11.

Sic intelligendo, res dicitur comprehendi, quando ita perfect cognoscitur,
quod nihil amplius de re cognosci potest: nec absolutum nec comparatum: Durand.
lib. 1. did. 35. quae. 2 col. 214. in fine. A liud enim est videre; aliud est
totum videndo comprehendere: Totum autem comprehenditur videndo, quod ita
videtur ut nihil lateat videntem. Aug. ep. 1 12. cap. 9.


comprehensive vision whereby God is not only in his proper essence and
substance seen manifestly and clearly, but also fully comprehended:
Comprehension is taken two ways; first, for the obtaining of that which any
one desires: And so all the blessed in heaven are said to comprehend, because
they have obtained that which in this life they sought after; and in this sense
the Apostle speaks, 1 Cor. 9.24. So run that ye may obtain; that ye may
comprehend as judicious Beza, and the common translation read it. Again,
comprehension is taken for the perfect and adequate knowledge of any thing; and
so a thing is said to be comprehended by our understanding of it, when it is so
perfectly known, that nothing more concerning it can be known. That is
perfectly known, which is known so far forth as it is cognoscible, or
knowable. Again, that is said to be comprehended which is so seen that nothing
of it lies hid to the party seeing, when he sees all that is in it: Now there
can be no Nunquam est comprehensio objecti a potentia, nifi quando tanta est
intellectivitas potentiae intelligentis, quanta est intelligibilitas objecti
intellecti, aliter enim actus non potest esse adaequatus objecto; and propter
hoc porentia talis non comprehendit objectum Scot. quae. reportat. lib. 3 did.
14. quae. 2.
comprehension of the object, in regard of the faculty, unless when the
Intellectivitie (as the School phrase has it) of the intelligent faculty, be
such as the intelligibilitie of the object that is to be understood; otherwise
the act cannot be adequate to the object, and in this regard such a faculty
cannot comprehend the object: To make this plain, the act I mean of the
intellect, the intellect being taken for the intellective, or understanding
faculty, must be as vastly extensive in knowing as the object is cognoscible,
or knowable: So that to see God by this comprehensive vision is so fully to
know God, that nothing whatsoever is in God is hid; but is openly, clearly,
fully, and manifestly known: and thus no man has seen God at any time, but
the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father (the Spirit not
excepted.) The words taken in this sense it is true, that no created nature has,
or ever shall see God; neither the Angels nor Saints in heaven can see him so
far as to comprehend him: Because an Insinitum objectuin, ut infin itum,
comprehendi non potest, nisi aliquo actu infinito, ut infinicto. Scotus,
quodlib. quae. 1.
infinite object, as infinite, cannot be comprehended by any but an infinite
act, considered as infinite.

The question now will be of the fourth way of seeing God; whether the Fathers
and the people of the Jews did not see Christ according to his flesh, his
humane nature: I answer, they did see him so by Faith, which makes things to
come as already present; and this is proved, John 8.56. Your father Abraham
rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it and was glad: Here is a Metonymia est
adjuncti pro subjecto: nam diei nomine intelligendus est ipse Christus
incarnatus, in tempore five die illo manifestatus. Rolloc. in loc.
Metonymie of the Adjunct for the Subject; for by the day we are to understand
Christ incarnate, the time of Christ's manifestation in the flesh: And thus
Abraham saw him and all that were the children of Abraham by Faith; Christ was
(...), God-man, according to both natures, a mediator to the Fathers and the
people of the Jews who lived in the time of the Law: before he did assume his
humane nature, he was a Mediator according to both natures; because then he
was the Mediator of men as he was to be incarnate, he is now a Mediator as he
is incarnate. Saint Unus est Deus and unus Mediator Dei and hominum, homo
Christus Jesus: quoniam non est aliud nomen sub caelo datum hominibus in quo
oporteat nos salvos fieri; and in illo definivit Deus fidem omnibus, suscitans
illum a mortuis: itaque sine ista side, hoc est, sine fide unius mediator is
Dei and hominum, hominis Christi Jesu, sine fide inquam resurrection is ejus,
quam Deus hominibus definivit, quae utique sine incarnatione ejus ac morte, non
potest veraciter credi, fine fide ergo incarnation is and mortis, and
resurrectionis Christi: nec antiquos justos, ut justi essent a peccatis,
potuisse mundari, and Dei gratia justificari, veritas Christiana non dubitat.
Aug. de peccat. Origin. lib. 2. cap. 24. to 7.
Augustine makes this plain from the 1 Timothy 2.5. For there is one God, and one
Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus: From whence he
concludes, that without Faith or believing this one Mediator of God and men,
the man Christ Jesus: And that without believing the incarnation, death, and
resurrection of Christ, the holy Fathers could not be made clean, and
justified by the Grace of God, that they should be justified from their sins:
And this (says the Father) the Christian verity does not doubt: So then it is
plain that the people of the Jews having Christ their Mediator, according to
both natures, and believing his incarnation, death, and resurrection, (without
which they could not be justified before God) had knowledge both of Actual and
eternal remission: And did believe Actual and Eternal remission of sins
present, their sins being in Jesus Christ Actually and Eternally remitted
unto them. For the meaning of this place, John 1.18. The Jews did depend
altogether upon the authority of Moses, in regard he spoke with God face to
face; the Evangelist to the intent he might bring them off from that
overvaluing esteem they had of Moses, in opposition to Christ: denies that
any man has seen God at any time, but the only begotten Son which is in
the bosom of the Father, one with him who knows all his secrets, he has
declared him. By him Moses had those things which he delivered to the people,
Per hunc; gratiam achdem: voluntas Patris exposita est Mosi, per hunc datae
sunt faederis tabulae, factae sunt promissiones, and quicquid aliud
beneficiorum Dei isti populo concessum est. Muscul. in loc.
by him the will of the Father was made known to Moses, by him the Tables of
the Covenant were given, the promises were made, and whatsoever other benefits
were granted to that people of God: And it is true that no man considered in
his natural condition has seen God at any time, 1 Cor. 2.14. The natural
man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, Matthew. 11, 27. No man
knows the Son but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the
Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him: The Sensus igitur est
quod absque revelatione per Filium in verbo Evangelii exterins, and per S. 8.
illuminationem interius factam, nec essentiae, nec voluntatis divinae,
salutatis and salvifica cognitio, cuiquam hominum in hac vita obtingere possit.
Ger^ard. loc. Tom 9. col. mihi, 719.
meaning is, that without revelation by the Son in the Word of the Gospel
outwardly, and by the illumination of the holy Ghost inwardly: it is impossible
for any man to attain to the saving knowledge of God: And by this way did all
believers in all times come to know God savingly, without which it was
impossible for them to be saved. As for that place, 2 Cor. 4.6. For God who
has commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts:
to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
Christ: If we consider these words in Alludit perpetuo in toto hoc sermon
Apostolus ad Mosis faciem, laciem illam non apertam, (utclara esset Dei imago)
sed opertam. Beza in loc.
allusion to Moses; they do not exclude the people of the Jews, from having
the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, but they include
thus much, that we under the Gospel have a clearer light, the veil being done
away.

Page 52. He makes use of Gal. 4.1. The Heir, as long as he is a Child,
differs nothing from a servant, though he be Lord of all: Who are the Heirs
under age? even the Jews, until the time came that God sent forth his Son,
etc. They were the Heirs under age that differed not from servants, Now I say
(says he) They that had knowledge of actual and Eternal remission differed
from servants: They that differed nothing from servants, had not knowledge of
actual, and eternal remission: You see his Argument and what he concludes,
let us see how he can make it good from the words rightly expounded: The Apostle
says, the Heir as long as he is a Child differs nothing from a servant:
The word [ nothing Quod nihil differat a servo, particula (...) nihil,
intelligatur (...), non absolute, sed quoad (...) and subjectionem, Par^us in
loc.
] is not to be understood absolutely, but in regard of Subjection, as is
expounded in the second verse: but is under Tutours and Governors: as a
servant is not at his own liberty, but under the command of his Master. So the
Heir while he is a Child is under Tutors, etc. and differs nothing from a
servant, in regard of his present subjection; yet this Subjection does not make
him of a Son to become a servant; for his Sonship remains for all that:
neither does his differing nothing from a servant, (which is to be restrained
to his present subjection) take away his right of inheritance, for the Apostle
says, He is Lord of all; And in this he differs from a Servant, who is no
ways Lord; neither does remain in the house always, as it is, Jah. 8.35. Well
then, according to the Metaphor, take the Church of the Jews, for the Heirs
under age, differing nothing from Servants; Notwithstanding this servitude
Neque tamen haec servitus haereditati, and adoptioni little derogabat, crant
nihilominus filii, haeredes, domini omnium; sub externa servitute conscientias
liberas habentes, spiritu filiali intus Deo libere servientes; certi enim de
grathita remissione pec^atorum, per fidem venturi Christi, conscientias a
mortis and peccati Tyrann de liberas habebant quantum saluti suae satisesset,
Parcus in loc.
did not derogate from their inheritance, and adoption. They were nevertheless
Sons, Heirs, Lords of all; under this outward servitude they had their
consciences free, serving God freely in the inner man, with a filial spirit;
for they were certain of free remission of sins by Faith in Christ, and had
their consciences freed from the tyranny of death, and sin, so far forth as
was sufficient for their Salvation: So that this place of Scripture, rightly
understood, makes altogether against him; for from hence we may gather, that
the Itaque hic verborum Apostoli sensus est; nemo puter me quae hactenus dixi,
in Patrum ant gentis Judaicae contumeliam dixisse: sueru^t enim hi quo que
filii Dei, and promissionum haeredes; neque me latet quod olim pronuntiavit
Deus, Israel est filius meus primogenitus: Item, ex Aegypto vocavi filium meum,
Exodus 4. Hose. 11. Gualter in Gal. hom. 31
Fathers under the Old Testament, had hope of the same inheritance which we
have at this very day, because they were partakers of the same adoption: and
they were chosen of God to this end, that they should be the sons of God
together with us, as well as we. Again, we gather from this place that in
external servitude (which to them was no servitude, but as it is compared with
our condition since the coming of Christ) they had freedom of conscience;
neither did the strict observation of the Law, hinder Moses, Daniel, all the
godly Kings, Priests, and Prophets, and the whole company of believers, but
that they were free in spirit: Therefore they did so bear the yoke of the Law
upon their shoulders (which, I say again, was not to them a yoke, but
comparatively to the Christian liberty by the coming of Christ) that they did
serve God with a free spirit; and were principally and especially Praesertim
vero de gratuita peccatorum remissione edocti, ut conscientias haberent a
peccati and mortis Tyrannide solutas. Inde constituendum est, candem semper
suisse doctrinam, and vera fidei unitate nobiscum fuisse conjunctos, unius
etiam Mediatoris fiducia nobisctan fretos. Calvin in loc.
taught, and instructed concerning free remission of sins; and had their
consciences loosed from the Tyranny and slavery of sin and death; From whence
it is concluded that there was always one and the same Doctrine, and that they
were joined with us in the true unity of Faith, and that they did enjoy with us
affiance and hope in one and the same Mediator, in whom they had boldness and
access with confidence by the Faith of him, Ephesians. 3.12. and therefore it must
necessarily follow that they had not an overly, but an experimental knowledge
of actual and eternal remission, having assurance in their consciences, that
their sins were at that present time wherein they lived, actually and eternally
remitted in Christ; Otherwise we must conclude that the sins of believers in
the time of the Law, were not remitted till Christ's manifestation and coming
in the flesh, which is most absurd and contradictory to Scripture; They had
Christ in Spirit, They believed in Christ, and were saved by him as we are; as
it is, Heb. 13.8. Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
Yesterday to our Fathers, to day to us, for ever to ours: all that ever were
saved, were saved by one and the same Christ, who is the way, being Quia igitur
haereditas caelestis non est nisi una, (...) una ejus parandae via, ac ratio,
perspicuum est unam substantia esse veteris and novi Testaments Ecclesiam, and
salutis doctrinam, contra quam ^ana^ici and papistae contendunt, Pareus com. in
Gal. cap. 4. 1.
ever the same; yesterday, before the time of his coming in the flesh, to day,
when he did come in the flesh; at the time before appointed; now and for ever
the same Christ, to all believers in all times, all believers in all ages,
being for substance, one and the same Church of God; Christ was Exhibitus
Patribus in promissione ita ut eorum fider non minus praesen: fue; it sanguis
Christi sun dendus; quam sidei nost^ae praefens est jamolim effusus, Tessan in
Epist. ad Hebr. praelect. cap. 13.8.
exhibited in the promise to the Fathers; and the blood of Christ to be shed,
was no less present to their Faith, then the blood of Christ long ago shed,
is present to our Faith, Heb. 9.22. Without shedding of blood is no remission:
and it was by the shedding of the same blood, that all Gods people from the
beginning of the world, ever had remission.

Pareus Unde commentum pontificium de limbo, in quem Patres fideles, crudeliter
detruferunt; ubi nulla salute fruerentur, eminus tancum sururam intuerontur,
firmiter destruitur, Pareus in loc.
that godly and learned man, from his place, Gal. 4.1. concludes that if the
Fathers were Heirs, and Lords of the inheritance with us, they were therefore
saved by Faith no less than we, whereby he condemns the Papists concerning
their Altis debetur sola paenadamni, solum temporalis, absque ulla paena
sensus, and isti dicebantur esse in limbo Patrum, qui prohibebantur an
e^passionem Christi a visione divina, eo quod non crat satisfactum pro peccato
totius naturae, quan^vis hi non essent obnoxii alicur panae, pro peccatis suis
personalibus, Durand. lib. 3. did. 22 quae. 4.
limbus, wherein they have cruelly shut up the Fathers, where they enjoy not
salvation, but behold it afar off only to come: and this is just according to
his proposition as he defends it, that they had knowledge of actual and
eternal remission to come, not present, but afar off: His proposition is
far more cruel and injurious to the Fathers, than the opinion of the Papists
is about the limbus: They have devised and imagined in their wandering conceit,
four infernal and subterrestriall places. First, Hell. Secondly, Purgatory.
Thirdly, Limbus infantum, where Children remain dying without baptisime.
Fourthly, Limbus Patrum, where all the Fathers were before Christ's coming in
the flesh: And their opinion is, that they were kept in an infernal place, or
dungeon of darkness, yet without pain, they did suffer the punishment of
loss only, and that but for a time, for this Limbus did endure but till the
coming of Christ: and Constituunt Scholastici communi consensu, intra terram
quatuor sinus, five unum in quatuor parts divisum, unum pro damnatis; alterum
pro purgandis: tertium pro Infantibus, sine baptismo abeuntibus: quartum pro
justis qui moriebantur ante Christi passionem, qui nunc vacuus remanet,
Bellarm. Tom 2. de Purgator. lib. 2. cap. 6. page mihi. 410.
Bellarmin himself speaking of the Limbus says, this place now remains
empty: So that the Papists you see shut the Fathers out of Heaven but for a
time, and that not to suffer the torments of hell, but the punishment of loss
only: But according to his proposition, if the knowledge of actual and
eternal remission, was no Article of the Jews Creed, they must needs suffer
the loss of Heaven, and the torments of hell, and that not for a time, but to
eternity: O fearful consequence!

Remission Necessaria est doctrina de remission peccatorum in Ecclesia: nam
haec porta est per quam ingredimur in coetum electorum and vitam aeternam,
Aretius, loc. Com. de Remiss. Peccat. col. mihi. 191.
of sins is the gate through which we enter into the company of the Elect,
and eternal life; shut up this gate, no getting into Heaven.

Now look Page 51. In the New Covenant (says he) the Prophet Preached
eternal remission, but not yet actual, as though Gods people of old had not
remission of sins in act, before Christ's coming in the flesh: a man may as
well say with the Papists, they went not into heaven before Christ's coming in
his humane nature, nay, by this opinion they must never go at all. The Prophet
David in preaching the new Covenant, preached actual remission, Psalm. 32.1,
2. Blessed is the man whose transgression is forgiven (that is, remitted)
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not iniquity, and ver. 5. Thou
forgavest the iniquity of my sin (that is, thou did remit) as Saint Beati
quorum remissae sunt iniquitates^ Tu remisisti impieratem peccati mei, H^eron.
Descriptio beatitudinis, petitur a causa efficiente, and continente, quae est
remissio peccatorum, vel justificatio cum ejus effectis. Ames Lect. in loc.
Hierome reads it: this must needs beactuall remission, and by consequent,
eternal, in regard remission once had, can never be lost, and there is, and
ever was, the same Numericall remission of sins to all believers; All the Elect
having always Non semper omnes electi eam habent actu, sed omnes Credentes eam
actu habent semper, ergo electitum demum habent actu, cum convertuntur, and
fide donantur, quoad propositum vero Dei eam habent. Denique remissio seinel
facta in hac vita, semper and in omnem aeternitarem durabit, sic ut in aeternum
non sunt imputandanohis peccata semel remissa, Polan. Syntag. lib. 6. cap. 36
page mihi, 466.
remission of sins in regard of Gods purpose: and so it may be said to be
eternal remission, a part ante (as we use to say) for time past and before;
it being in Gods eternal purpose: but all the elect have not this remission
always in act: when they do believe and are converted, then they have it in
act, and this is actual remission. Again, remission once granted, does
remain to all eternity; for sins once remitted shall not be imputed to us
for ever, and thus it is eternal (a part post) that is, for time to come.

The second place he uses to prove his proposition page 52. is Gal. 4.25. Ne
enim videretur Jerosolymam a regibus, patribus ingenuis, liberis Abrahae filiis
olim habitatam injuria comparate ancillae Hagar, adstringit nominatim ad
Jerosolymam praesentem, ubi tunc Sacerdotes, Scribae, Pharisaei, nomodidascali,
dominabantur in Synagoga. Pareus in loc.
Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children; his argument from
this place is this: They that were in bondage had not knowledge of actual and
eternal remission: He does abuse this Text and wrests it contrary to the
intent of the Scripture: The Apostle by Jerusalem does not understand the Jews
in the time of the old Testament: but of Jerusalem that now is, of the state of
Jerusalem after Christ was manifested in the flesh; as it was at that time when
the Apostle spoke these words. And lest he should seem injuriously to compare
Non considerat vetus Testamentum in se, sed ostendit Hagar and Ismaelem typum
fuisse little, qui etiam manifestato Evangelio, in serviture legis manner
malunt, quam amplecti veritatem: Tossan. in loc.
Jerusalem once inhabited of the Kings, Patriarchs, and free borne Sons of
Abraham, to Agar the bondwoman; he does restrain his speech to Jerusalem as
it is now, the present condition of it, where the Priests, Scribes, Pharisees,
and the Teachers of the Law did rule in the Synagogue. The Fathers before
Christ did observe the Law by right, because God did then command and approve
of legal services; but now these were abolished by Christ. Yet these
unbeleeving Jews at this present would be under the Law in opposition to
Christ and the freedom they might have by him, and so bring themselves into
bondage. So that this place is not spoken of the Jews in the time of the Law;
but of those who lived in the time of the Gospel. For his answer page 53. That
this was acknowledged that they should hereafter differ from servants, but for
the present they did not: If they were for the present servants, so far forth
that they lived and died without knowledge of actual and eternal remission
present; they must needs perish; and what benefit had they that the Church of
the Jews in after time should differ from servants, who for the present lived
and died in such a miserable condition?

But further to prove the people of the Jews to be in bondage, and so not to
have knowledge of actual and eternal remission, he^ goes on page 53. in these
words; If any say that the bondage of the Jews was not a bondage of
conscience, but a yoke of ceremonies: I answer, Yes, (says he) even a bondage
of conscience, which stung their hearts; for besides the authority of
interpreters, it is said that the children through fear of death were subject
to bondage all their lives long. Heb. 2.25. I would gladly know whom these
interpreters are, that hold that all the believing Jews before Christ's
incarnation, were under that bondage of conscience which stung their hearts:
Godly Satan per peccatum, in tristissima serviture sub jugo suo tenebar genus
humanum ita ut non modo in continuo mortis meru essent, verum etiam nihil aliud
expectare possent miserrimi homines, nisi ut per corporalem mortem, in aeternam
mortem seu damnationem praecipitarentur. Osiand. in loc. Mors hic non
separationem modo animae a corpore significat, sed paenam, quae ab irato deo
infligitu^ut aeternum exitium comprehendat Calvin, in loc.
Interpreters expound it thus: That Satan by sin, did hold all mankind in a
sorrowful servitude, and bondage under his yoke, that they were not only in
continual fear of death, but by corporal death did fear the falling down
headlong into eternal death; By death in this place is to be understood, not
only the separation of the soul from the body, but the punishment which is
inflicted upon us from an angry God; so that it comprehends eternal
destruction; and thus every wicked man that is out of Christ, is through the
fear of death temporal, as being the gate to eternal death, all his life
time subject to bondage. The believing Jews were not subject to this bondage,
they were the Sons of God, and did receive the spirit of adoption; and this
slavish fear and bondage was taken away from them by Christ, for they were the
sons of God by adoption as well as we.

Pa. 54. To prove that this was a bondage of conscience (says he) What is it
that makes death bitter but the sting of death? and what is the sting of death
but sin? Wherefore they had conscience of sin: This is a doctrine most
injurious to the people of God in those times, and against the blood of Christ:
certainly the sting of death, and so of conscience, was by Christ taken from
them: and they could say as well as believers now; as it is, Nec quicquam
obstabit, quin olim corpora nostra resuscitentur; and fiat quod olim per
propheras and Apo^^olos praedictum est: Gual. in loc. hom. 87. Verba Prophetae;
vel Apostoli laetantis, Hos. 13.14. Glo. Ordin.
1 Cor. 15.55, 56, 57. O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy
victory: The sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the Law, but
thanks be to God who has given us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

Page 55. he argues thus: If the Jews between Moses time and John Baptist,
were under the Law, then under the curse: that they were under the Law, is
proved, Gal. 3.23.24. But if under the Law, then under the curse, Gal. 3.10.
Can he prove that because the Apostle says, Before faith came, we were kept
under the Law: therefore the Jews were under the curse; and from Moses to John
Baptists time lived and died under the curse, which must of necessity follow?
Never did any man mis-apply, and mis-interpret-Scripture more grossly; for
this place will prove clearly, that their being kept under the Law, was not a
curse, but a blessing upon them; and that in a high degree; (...): Erat lex
quoddam (...), munimentum, quo circumse ptus populus ille, conspicuus,
inexpugnabilis, impermixtus, usque ad Christum conservabatur, ab aliis populis
separatus permanebat, Pareus in loc.
(...), signifies to be fenced about with a garrison of men; God did give unto
this nation many particular privileges, they being a peculiar people unto
himself; as the moral Law written, the Priesthood, Rites, Ceremonies, and
form of government; now the Law was quoddam [(...)] that is, a wall of
defense, with which the people were hedged in round about, and were
conspicuous, inexpugnable, and kept separated from other nations until the
coming of Christ: and thus to be kept under the Law was a peculiar favor of
God to the^ above al other nations in the world, as God himself witnesses,
Deuteronomy. 4.7, 8. For what nation is there so great, who has God so nigh unto
them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for? And what
nation is there so great, that has statutes and judgments so righteous, as
all this Law, which I set before you this day? This place does confute him: the
Dicturi erant pscudoapostoli, Etiamsi co^cedamus justitiam non manare ex lege,
sed ex gratuita in Christo promissione, quum tamen Deus, quem semper unum and
sui similem esse testatus est, oeconomiam istam Mosaicam constituerit, etc. quo
jure vis illam abo^ere? Responder Apostolus temporariam fuisse istam
oeconomiam, Beza, in loc.
scope and design of the Apostle is to confute the false Apostles, who were
ready to say; Although we grant righteousness not to come by the Law; but from
the free promise in Christ: Notwithstanding God who is unchangeable, did give
the Mosaicall Law and oeconomie, as you confess, to bring us to Christ: how
then can this stand with the unchangeablenesse of God that this Law should be
abolished? The Apostle makes answer, that by Gods appointment, this was but
Temporary: and to endure but till faith came, that is, till Christ's coming in
the flesh; for Faith is taken metonymically for the principal object of Faith;
and it were fearfully desperate to think that all the people from Moses to
John Baptist lived so under the Law, as that they were without faith in Jesus
Christ: Thus you see this place makes against him, and in stead of a curse
pronounces a blessing: it being the blessing of God upon the Jews to be kept
under the Law till Faith came; that is, till Christ's incarnation: The believing
Jews before the coming of Christ were under the Law in respect of Ceremonies,
but not in respect of the malediction and curse thereof. To conclude this, if
by the Law of Moses we understand the Mosaicall Polity, so the Law by the
coming of Christ was abolished; if by the Law we understand the moral Law,
or ten Commandments, the curse of the Law is, and was ever taken away in
regard of all true believers living in all ages of the world: Causa
abrogationis manifesta haec est, Deus singulari beneficio constituit politiam
Mosaicam, ut esser certa fedes, and certa gens, and quali Schola in qua
servatetur doctrina de Filio Dei, and repeterentur promissiones, and adderentur
illustrissima testimonia, and in qua certum esset Filium assumpta natura
humana, concionaturum esse, and fururum victimam, and resurrecturum esse, and
editurum testimonia doctrinae, quia Deus de his tantis rebus, vult nos certos
esse, voluit autem postea finem esse hujus politiae. Melancthon. par 2. de leg.
page mihi. 251.
And likewise consider it as a guard whereby the Jews were fenced in, and
separated from all other nations, so it is by Christ's coming abolished:
Consider it as a rule of life; Thus Angels are under the Law, and Adam before
his fall, and the Saints now in heaven. And none yield more subjection to it
then they; and this subjection is their liberty: and thus the Law considered
as a rule of life, is the will of God, and is eternal as God himself.

Let us go on, and see how he can prove from Gal. 3.10. That the people being
under the Law were under the curse: The intent of the Apostle in this place is,
to prove justification by Faith in opposition to the works of the Law, as
Verse. 8, 9. And the Scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen
through Faith, preached before the Gospel unto Abraham; saying, In thee shall
all Nations be blessed. So then, they which be of Faith are blessed with
faithful Abraham; for as many as be of the Ex operibus legis cos vocat, qui in
illis constituunt salutis fiduciam, Calvin. in loc.
works of the Law are under the curse. In this 10. Verse Paul sets down a
reason whereby he proves that not only the Jews, but also the Gentiles are
blessed, as Abraham typus, and pater est omnium justificatoru^, deinde faedus
cum illo, and cum semine ejus factum est, ipse autem non operibus legis, sed
per fidem and imputatam justitiam, justus pronunciatus est. Ergo intelligitis
inquit Apostolus, and patrem and filios per fidem justificari Tossan. praelect.
in loc.
Abraham was by Faith; and the reason is drawn from the contraries, thus: They
that are of the works; that is, that look to be justified by the works of
the Law, are under the curse: Therefore they that are of Faith are blessed, and
justified with Abraham: So then it is plain, that not they who lived under the
Law were cursed, and under the curse, (which he most blasphemously affirms of
all the Jews between Moses and John Baptist, and so pronounces them damned)
but those who looked to be justified by the works of the Law, but so the
believing Jews did not: mark well the 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Verses of this third
Chapter to the Galatians, and you shall see this place makes against him in
other things as well as this. To this (says he) we may add, Heb. 11.39. And
these all having obtained a good report through faith, received not the
promise: Can he conclude from these words, that because they received not the
promise, therefore they were under the curse? Then the Apostle should seem to
derogate from and to diminish, nay to abolish the faith and felicity of the
Fathers: and indeed not to be constant to himself, but to deny that in this
Verse and in the 13. which he does affirm in the 33. where he says, they
obtained promises: This seeming contradiction may easily be reconciled if we
distinguish between the promises the Apostle here speaks of; we must observe
the Homonymie of the word [promise] which signifies diverse things: as Quantum
ad promissionem primam, negat ver. 13. patres ante Josuam consecuros esse
promissa.

2. Quantum ad alteram, negat hoc loco patres universos eam consecutos esse,
qui Messiam promissum incarne videre quidem deliderarunt, sed non viderunt.

Quantum ad tertiam, affirmat, ver. 33. omnes nobiscum consecutos promissionem
fuisse; omnes enim fide per gratiam Jesu Christi servati suerunt, sicut and
nos. Pareus, in loc.


first, the promised land of Canaan, and so in the 13. Verse, the Apostle
denies the Fathers who lived before Joshua, to have obtained the promises:
Secondly, by promise we are to understand the complement or fulfilling of the
promise concerning the Messiah to be revealed in the flesh; and so the Apostle
in the 39. verse denies the Fathers to have received the promise, because they
were not eyewitnesses of the promised Messiah come in the flesh: Thirdly, by
promise is to be understood the blessing of salvation promised in Christ; and
so the Apostle affirms in the 33. Verse that the fathers obtained the promise
together with us: all of them being saved by Faith through the grace of Jesus
Christ as well as we; so that it is plain, they were not under the curse, but
under the blessing, their estate and condition being blessed of God through
Jesus Christ. And whereas the Apostle in the 40. verse. says, God having
provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made
perfect: The Apostles meaning Non est hic sensus, nos alia ratione servati,
quam Patres in V. T. vel dilaram suisse Patrum salutem usque ad Christi
adventum; verum hic est sensus, licet tam excellentes viti suerint, and tam
illustri fide praediti, and subducti ex his terris; Non tamen cum ipsis
def^^sse Ecclefiam; aut idec minus honorifice sentiendum de populo N. T. cui
allquid melius providebatur: non quidem si fundamentum salutis spectes, sed
propter exhibitionem Messiae, per quem illi nobiscum, and nos cum illis, vere
perficimur and sanctificamur, unica. sc. illa oblatione corporis ipsius.
Tossan. in loc:
is, not that we under the New Testament are saved by another way, different
from that by which the Fathers were saved in the Old Testament; or that the
Salvation of the Fathers was deferred till Christ's coming in the flesh: (as
the Papists would have it) but the meaning of this place is, that although they
were such excellent men endued with such famous and precious Faith, and they
being taken out of this life, yet notwithstanding the Church did not end in
them, or that we should have a less honorable esteem of the people of the
New Testament, for whom God has provided some better things: Not better, if we
consider the foundation of salvation, but in regard of the exhibition and
manifestation of the Messiah in the flesh, by whom they and we are made perfect
and sanctified, by that one oblation of his body, as it is, Heb. 10.10. Through
the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all, even for the Fathers as
well as for us. Those places which he uses concerning the difference of the
promulgation of the New Covenant, Page 54. First, In the time of Adam, Genesis
3.15. Secondly, To Abraham: Thirdly, In Isaiahs time, Isa. 53. Fourthly, In
Moses time: Fifthly, In Daniels time; make against him altogether: as that in
Genesis, The seed of the Woman shall break the Serpents head: In this place
Tria itaque hic habes descripta, 1. Adami and Hevae peccatum, 2. Deinde spem
per Christum, 3. Tunc nostri hostis Satanae accuratam descriptionem sub
serpentis figuta, Pet. Mart. in loc.
is described the sin of Adam, and hope of pardon through Christ. By the seed
of the Woman, is meant Christ, and thus he proves that the New Covenant was
preached from Adam to Christ: and that all believers in all those ages were
under grace, and had the Covenant of grace preached to them.

But Page 55. Says he, The Prophets speak of a thing to come far off, yet
says he, They speak sometimes in the present and preterperfect tense, (again
in this he contradicts himself) and it is true, Isa. 6.9. The Prophet speaks
there in the present tense, Unto us a child is borne: he does not say, a
child shall be borne: Now the word [Nobis, us] does comprehend not only the
ancestors, which lived before; nor those which lived at that time, but the
successors and posterity of this people: for the change of times, and humane
mortality, does not take away the unity of the people of God; and several Ages
and Alia atque alia secula, morientiumque and nascent^um alterationes, non
constituunt alium atque alium populum; nec terminant gratiam Dei, ab aeterno

alterations of some men dying, and others being borne, do not constitute
another and another people; neither do they terminate the grace of God
(destinated to his people from eternity) to this or that particular generation
of believers, seeing that all the several generations of believers are but one
people of God; and Christ is the gift of this people of God, The same
yesterday, and to day, and for ever. And though Christ was to be borne in time
to Quamvis enim futurum hoc esset, post aliquot secula, ipsa tamen gratiae
hujus communicatio, non erar tempori nativitatis Christi alligata: sed toti
Ecclesiae electorum inde a principio illius ad finem usque destinata, Muscul.
in loc.
come, many Ages after; yet the communication of this grace, was not tied to
the time of Christ's Nativity, but was destinated and appointed to the whole
Church of God, from the beginning to the end, who (as I said before) though
they consist of diverse Generations of men, and lived in several ages of the
world; yet make but one Church and people of God. Consider the objection, Page
55. line 8. If any man say they speak sometime in the present, and
preterperfect tense: I answer, (says he) with Saint Peter, That not unto
themselves, but unto us they did minister those things, 1 Pet. 1.12. Let us
look into the true meaning of this place, it may be understood these ways:
First, The Prophets prophesied not unto themselves, that is, to the Jews; but
to us Christians: for they did Praedixerunt enim Christi adventu^, vocationem,
grat^a^ and salutem obventuram Christanis, non Judae^^, Cornel. a Lapide, in
loc.
foretell the coming of Christ, vocation, grace, and salvation to come, to
Christians, not to Jews; according to that of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 10.11. These
are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come.
Secondly, they did minister, not unto themselves; The Apostle means, that
those things which they prophesied, did not belong unto themselves, as is
plain, Act. 15.11. But the sufferings and glory of Christ were revealed to
them, not so much for their Non ta^ ip soru^ causa qua^ vestri, qu^^ratis co^um
lib^os lectu^i, Est^us in loc.
sakes (who did already believe) as for ours, who were to read their books;
that so our Faith likewise might be confirmed concerning him; considering the
Doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles to be one and the same, concerning his
incarnation. Thirdly, Not unto Non suo tempore, sed nostro, Lawren. in loc.
themselves, but unto us: that is, they did minister those things, and did
foretell that which was to be fulfilled, not in their times, but in our times.
Look then upon this, 1 Pet. 1.10, 11, 12. You shall see that the Prophets were
not Ministers of the Letter, but of the Spirit, ver. 11. The Spirit of Christ
was in them. They were Ministers likewise of the Gospel, ver. 10. Prophesied
of the Grace that should come. They were Evangelicall Prophets, and
Prophetical Evangelists: and no question they did not want the fruit and
benefit of their own Prophesies; neither were they excluded from the grace of
Christ, and the fruition and enjoyment of Christ; being made partakers of the
same salvation with us: though they did not see the Complement, and fulfilling
of the promise, in regard of Christ's apparition, Quibus etiam ait pa^esactum,
ver. 12. Eos non sibi, sed nobis illa administrate, non quantum ad fruitionem,
illi enim ejusdem salutis participes fiunt, sed quoad Christi apparitionem,
Tossan. praelect. in loc.
and exhibition in the flesh, with their bodily eyes, yet by they eye of Faith,
they did see and enjoy the present benefit of Christ's Incarnation, and
Manifestation in the flesh.

Whereas he says, Page 55. line 14. John speaks of the time hard at hand, or
present: We confess that this manner of speaking has respect to the
predictions concerning the Messiah, but yet it does not deny, but that the
Kingdom of God (as Kingdom is here taken; for the Kingdom of Regnum coelorum
regnu^ gratiae vocat, and misericordiae Dei in Christo, Pareus in loc.
Grace) was always at hand to true penitents; and that Christ was nearer to
them that lived many ages before John, who saw him with the eyes of Faith in
his incarnation many years before, than to them who lived in John's time, and
saw him in his humane nature, only with the eyes of the body.

Page. 55. The three last lines, there are these words, The Apostle after our
Saviors Ascension, speaks as of a thing actually past and done, showing
plainly the way and means whereby the Son of God has purged and sanctified
his Church: he proves this, Heb. 10.14. By one offering he has ever perfected
them that are Comprehendit hoc nomine omnes Dei Filios, Calvin. Christus, qui
nun^ ad dextram Dei sede^, ^nico suo sacrificio omnibus, quorquot salvandi
sunt, remissionem plen^ssimam omnium peccatorum unpetravit, Luc. Osiand. in loc.
sanctified.

I answer, That Christ's one offering, was ever the way to perfect such as were
sanctified; Believers in all times of the world, having no other way; and this
offering did extend it self to all believers, in regard of time past, present,
and to come. Dare any man conclude from this place, that Believers were not
actually sanctified, purged and perfected; and their sins actually remitted,
before Christ's Ascension into Heaven? if they do, it is popery: if not worse.

Page 56. at the latter end, (says he) There are I confess many difficulties
in the way, but I have not now leisure to remove them: The greatest is, that
the Jews are said to eat the same spiritual meat, and drink the same
spiritual drink, 1 Cor. 10.3, 4.

This objection was not made when he Preached; but was put to him since, and he
could not answer it: It Is strange, that having so long time, before he Printed
his Sermon, that he should in Print say, he had not leisure to remove it: But I
believe him, for this place does tell him to his face, that his Doctrine is
false: and this he will never be able to remove.

But to open this Scripture, They did eat the same spiritual meat, and
drank the same spiritual drink, to wit, the body and blood of Christ: (it is
plain then that they were not under the curse) The Apostle in this place
proves that the Fathers had the Sacrament of the Eucharistia est Communio
corporis, and sanguinis Christi: At Manna and aqua ex rupe fuerunt Israelitis
Eucharistia. Ergo Manna and Aqua ex rupe suerunt Israelitis Communio corporis
and sanguirus Christi: non potest ergo negati Sacramenta veteribus fuisse, quod
ad rem attinet, paria novis, Chamier. de Sacram. V. T. lib. 3. cap. 2.
Eucharist, (which we call the Lords Supper) as well as we: The Argument runs
thus: The Eucharist is the Communion of the body and blood of Christ: but Manna
and water out of the Rock, were to the Israelites the Eucharist: Therefore,
Manna, and water out of the Rock, were to the Israelites the Communion of the
body and blood of Christ: It cannot therefore be denied but the Sacraments were
to the Fathers, in regard of the thing signified, the same, and equal to the
Sacraments in the New Testament. Saint Aliud illi, aliud nos, sed specie
visibili, quod tamen hoe idem significaret, virtute Spiritali, Augustine. in
Evang. Joan. Tract. 26. Col. mihi. 228.
Augustine says, The Sacraments of the Fathers in regard of the outward signs
differ from ours: but in regard of the substance and the thing signified, they
are the same: This place then does absolutely prove, that they were not under
the curse, but had actual remission, and the knowledge of it present.

Page 56. At the latter end, his Answer is: They did cate the same meat, but
not after the same manner, for they did eat Christ to come, not present.

This is a new manner of eating Christ in the Sacrament, which cannot be proved
by Scripture: There is in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, a threefold Ad ipsum
Sacramentum Eucharistiae quod attinet, est ibi mandacatio, and bibitio triplex:
1, Oralis five corporalis: 2, Spiritualis: 3, Sacramentalis, Lawrent. Dialog.
Encharist. page 460.
eating. First, Orall or corporal: Secondly, Spiritual: Thirdly,
Sacramental. Now all true believers do spiritually eat the body and blood of
Christ, which really and indeed is taken and received, not with the mouth of
the body corporally, but with the mouth of Faith spiritually: The manner of
their eating was by Faith, ours is the same: To say a man eats a thing to come,
(is a gross piece of nonsense) How can that be? can one eat that which he
has not? can he eat bread to come? Christ was as really present to the
Fathers, in their Sacrament of the Eucharist, as he is to us in the Sacrament
of the Lords Supper: (But that I may not be mistaken, I will set down what I
mean by Christ's real presence in the Sacrament) though we hold a real
presence of Christ's body and blood in the Sacrament, yet do we not take it to
be local, bodily or substantial, but spiritual and mystical. First, to the
signs by Sacramental relation: Secondly, to the Communicants by Faith alone.
The first stands in this: That when the elements of Bread and Wine are present
to the hand, and to the mouth of the receiver; at the very same time, the body
and blood of Christ, are presented to the mind: thus, and no otherwise, is
Christ present with the signs. The second presence, in respect of the
Communicants, is, that Christ is really present to their believing hearts: They
by Faith applying when God gives Christ with his benefits, and man for his part
by Faith receives the same as they are given: There arises that union which is
between every good receiver and Christ himself; which union is not forged,
but a real, true, and near conjunction, nearer then which none is or can be,
because it is made by a solemn giving and receiving, that passes between God
and Man; as also by the bond of one and the same Spirit.

To come then to the point, considering there is a real union, and
consequently, a real communion between us and Christ; there must needs be
such a kind of presence wherein Christ is truly, and really present, to the
heart of him that receives the Sacrament in Faith: And such a real Communion
was there between the Fathers and Christ: and such a presence wherein Christ
was really present to them in the Old Testament, who received the Sacraments in
Faith. We conclude then, they did cate Christ present. If it be objected,
Christ was not in their time come in the flesh. The Apostle makes answer, Est
etiam fides, and praeteritarum rerum, and praesentium, and suturarum, Aug.
Ench^rid on, cap. 8.

Exhibitus patribus in promissione, ita ut eorum fidei non minus praesens
suerit sanguis Christi fundendus, quam fidci nostrae praesens est jam ol^m

Heb. 11.1. Now Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen. This place concerns the Worthies in the Old Testament, as
appears in the following part of the chapter; and stands in opposition to
those who think things not to be truly present, which are present by Faith:
So that Christ was present in his incarnation to the Fathers, not in opinion,
or imaginarily, but truly, and really, not potentially, but actually. God
freely giving, and they by Faith receiving whole Christ, God and Man, together
with all his benefits, were (in eodem instanti) in that very present point of
time, justified, and their sins pardoned, and actually remitted, and did
believe actual and eternal remission of sins present, to their souls, for
their everlasting salvation: The blood of Christ being by Faith instantaneally
and efficaciously present to them before his coming, as it is to us now since
his coming in the flesh. But as he would have it, the Fathers ate him to come,
we eat him gone and past; and what will follow? That neither they nor we, but
only they who lived in the days of his flesh eat him present; what is become
of Faith all this while?

Page 67. Do you not (says he) remember what was Parcius ista memento.
whispered at the Assize some years past: That the great malefactors
condemned the little ones? This it may be was true.

To this I answer, there was a whispering at the Assize some years past: That
there was a great Malefactor (as it seemed probable) to cloak his own guilt,
would have condemned, and did accuse the innocent.

Page 73. Who would have thought (says he) but that zeal for the Sabbath, and
God, had been an undoubted mark of Salvation? but (he concludes) you see the
contrary. To this I answer, had it been true zeal, it had been an undoubted
mark of a true Christian: bat his words were when he preached; That people
might make a strict conscience of the observation of the Sabbath, and yet stone
Christ out of the Church: which to me seems to be a lewd speech; strictness
implying sincerity; besides they that questioned our Savior did it not so
much out of conscience as humor.

Page 74. He propounds this question: First, whether a desire to be saved be an
infallible note of salvation? (he says) the safest way is to say no. Secondly,
whether a desire to believe be Faith it self?

To this I answer, if he speaks of every defire of salvation, the question is
needless; and to propound a question of so great consequence without further
expressing himself, is but to set a Trap to ensnare weak consciences; and to
handle the word deceitfully; But I answer, an unfeigned desire of salvation in a
sanctified use of the means, is an infallible note of salvation. Give me
leave to explain my self thus. The difference and degrees of Faith are two.
First, A weak Faith. Secondly, A strong Faith. Concerning the first. The weak
Faith shows it self by this grace of God, namely, an unfeigned desire, not
only of salvation, (for that a wicked and graceless man may have) but of
reconciliation with God in Christ. This is a sure sign of Faith in every
touched and humbled heart: and it is peculiar to the elect; and they which have
this, have in them also the ground and substance of true saving Faith. Reason
to prove this; First, the promise of life everlasting is made to the desire of
reconciliation. Est autem valde cemphatica metaphora, famis and sitis, qua non
levis expetitio, sed vehemens, serium, and ardens desiderium g^atiae and
donorum, per gratiam describitur: Gerhard. Harm. cap. 15. col. mih^ 535.
Matthew. 5.6. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness,
for they shall be filled: by hungring and thirsting here is meant an ardent and
earnest desire after grace, which our Savior lays down as an infallible note
of salvation: Psalm. 145.19. He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him,
he will also hear their cry, and will save them: and Desiderium efficax and
pietati congruens, certissima est nota homin^s pii.

Usus, Consolationis erga Christianos, qui infirmitatibus and tentationibus
nonnunquam pressi and vexari nihil in semetipsis salu i affine sentire possunt:
praeter desideria pia. Ames. lect. in Psalm.


Doctor Ames upon Psalm. 42.1.2. As the Heart pants after the water brooks, so
pants my soul after thee O. God: my soul thirsts for God: lays down this
point of doctrine: Aneffectuall desire congruent to piety, is a most certain
note of a godly man from which he draws an use of consolation to Christians,
who are sometimes so pressed and disquieted with infirmities and tentations,
that they have no evidence in themselves of their salvation, but only godly
desires.

Secondly, the hungring desire after grace is a sanctified affection; where one
affection is sanctified, all are sanctified; where all are sanctified, the
whole man is sanctified; and he that is sanctified, is justified and believes,
and shall infallibly be saved.

Thirdly, God accepts the will and desire to believe for repenting and
believing indeed: wherefore this desire of reconciliation (if it be soundly
wrought in the heart) is in acceptance with God as true faith indeed. It Is
confessed that there be many and sundry fleeting motions and desires to do
good things; which grow to no issue or head, but in time vanish as they come:
Now these are not true desires after salvation, but rather flashing humors,
and sudden passions. Such have no soundness in them; and must be distinguished
from the true desire of reconciliation with God, that comes from a bruised
heart, and brings always reformation of life: And thus I have answered both
his questions.

Whereas in his conference, Page 3. he has this comparison: The poor man can
tell you, that to be rich, and to desire to be rich are two things; even so is
Faith, and a desire to believe: as all that desire to be rich are not rich, so
all that desire to believe do not believe: I answer, (non cadem est ratio) his
comparison holds not, but is as poor as the poor man in it: A man may
seriously and in good earnest have a hungring desire after riches, and yet be
a stark beggar, and have no riches at all; but it is not so in the desire of
grace: I argue thus, he that desires grace must needs have the Spirit, for
this desire cannot come of Voluntas est animi motus, cogente nullo ad aliquid
non admittendum, vel adipiscendum Haec autem ut non admittat malum, and
adipiscatur bonum, praeven^tur and praeparatur Dei gra^ia and ipsa bona
volun^as pedisse qua est granae, non praevia, Magist lib 2. did 20.
nature, Phil. 2.13. It is God that works in you both to will and to do
acccrding to his good pleasure: So that to will or desire good is from grace
wrought in the soul by the Spirit of God; yea this is a singular grace: Tee
have begun (says the Apostle) not only to do, but also to be forward or
willing, 2 Cor. 8.10, 11. making it a greater grace to be willing and desirous
to do well, then it is to do the thing that is good: and thereupon infers,
Verse. 12. If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a
man has, and not according to that he has not: Yea this is almost all, that
the faithful have many times to comfort themselves withal, that they find in
themselves an unfeigned desire to please God: This was all that Nehemiah could
say of himself, and the rest of his brethren, Nehem. 1.11. That they did
desire to fear Gods Name: Isa. 26.8. The desire of our soul is to thy Name.
This was Paul's comfort, Romans 7.18. To will is present with me. From these
places, that godly, reverend Divine Master Hildersam John 4. page mihi 9. in
the beginning.
Arthur Hildersam concludes: They must needs be sure therefore of Grace, that
have an unfeigned desire of it, for they have it already; No man can desire
Faith that has not Faith: the desire then of Grace is Grace, and the desire of
Faith is Faith; and he that has any one Grace in truth and soundness in him,
he may be certain that his heart is upright, and that he is truly regenerate:
thus Master Hildersam upon the fourth of John page (in my edition) 425. And the
Omnes virtutes sibi haerent, ut qui una carn^rit, omnibus careat: qui ergo unam
habet, omnes haber, Magist. lib. 3 did. 36.

Omnes in hoc conveniun, quod qui habet unam virtutem Theologicam, habet omnes.
Henric. de Vrimaria. Add. in lib. Senten.


School affirms; That all the graces of God are so conjoined, and together;
that he that wants one grace in truth, wants all; and he that has any one
grace in truth, has al other graces. Thus then you see, though his comparison
holds good in things temporal; that a desire to be rich is not to be rich: yet
it falls to the ground in things spiritual; for the poor humbled soul that
desires grace is rich in grace. And Master Perkins Cases of Conscience, page
mihi 24 col. 1. Sect.
Perkins concludes that a desire to repent and believe in a touched conscience
and heart, is Faith and repentance it self, though not in nature, yet in Gods
acceptance. O poor souls, you that complain of the want of Faith and Grace,
out of a hungering desire you have after them, comfort your drooping spirits
against such desperate disconsolate doctrine as this, merely contrary to the
doctrine of the Gospel, and the true way of preaching Free Grace by Christ, who
will not break a bruised Reed, nor quench smoking Flax; if an an Angel from
heaven preach any other doctrine believe him not. I say again, cheer up your
hearts; The gates of Hell shall never prevail against you, you are rich in
grace and all the precious promises of the Gospel belong to you; and all the
riches of Gods mercy in Christ Jesus are yours; what shall I say more? I
conclude, God is yours, Christ is yours, and all is yours.

Now we are come to the third question laid down in Page the 74. at the latter
end: Whether when Faith lies hid, that we cannot see that we believe by the
inward Testimony of our conscience, that it is possible our works of piety or
charity can assure us of salvation? his answer is: I say no; and my reasons
are these.

1. That which makes me doubt of my Faith, will make me doubt of the sincerity
of my work.

2. How is it possible I should judge my work sincere, when I cannot see I
believe? Whatsoever is not of Faith is sin.

I answer, there are diverse grounds which make a man doubt of his Faith,
different from those which make him doubt of the sincerit^e of his work; as
through the want of apprehension, whereby he can say from his conscience that
he is justified and at peace with God: And in regard of spiritual desertions:
There is a twofold inward testimony of conscience: The first is an immediate
knowledge that a man does believe, which is by the prime and next efficient
cause; namely the Spirit of God; called the Id est eandem fidem, ex ejusdem
Spiritus afflatu, and dono Beza in loc.
Spirit of Faith, 2 Cor. 4.13. and this is more fully set down down, 1 Cor.
2.12. Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is
of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.

The second inward testimony of conscience is the sincerity of a man's work,
whereby a Christian knows he does believe; and concerning the sincerity of
the work none can judge but a man's own conscience, whose proper office it is;
and this the Apostle sets down, 2 Cor. 1.12. For our rejoicing is this, the
testimony of our Certebonam conscientiam habemus quod candide, and ca an
misinceritate quam Dominus in nobis requiri^, un sumus. Luc. Ostand. in loc.
conscience: that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly
wisdom, but by the grace of God we have had our conversation in the world.
Conscience being that privitie which the soul has to things known to none
but God and it self, is able to judge of the intention of every action: So
that as a tree is known by the fruits; in like manner Faith is certainly
known by its fruits, as the cause is known by the effect. And the Apostle
Insallibile est signam vere r^natorum: organm a postenori valor. Arett. com. in
loc.
1 John 3.14. makes love to the brethren an infallible sign of a regenerate
man; We know that we have passed from death to life because we love the
brethren. So that although we cannot immediately see that we do believe, yet
if we find in our conscience that we love the brethren, we know by this that
we do believe; for as breath is a certain sign and evidence of present
life, so love to the brethren of present Faith; even as we see that when the
Sun is eclipsed, though the earth wants the light of it, yet not the real
influence; and though men see not the Sun in the light of it, they do see it
in its real influence and virtue; So although Faith may be hid in regard of
the souls immediate seeing it, yet it may evidently see it does believe in
regard of Faiths real influences, and effects; love to the brethren being one:
and thus though Faith lies hid, Charity does and can assure us of our
salvation.

Page 75. What works are done in Faith (says he) that the same acts may not
be done in the spirit of bondage? If you say indeed that the actions are the
same, but they differ in the end; I grant it, and in the efficient also: but as
I cannot discern the efficient, so neither can I discern the end of my work.

To this I answer, I discern the efficient by the end; he that has a
discursive intellect and can make use of that reason which God bath given him,
can easily tell to what end he undertakes such and such an action; The end
being the first thing in the Finis qui ultimus est executione, primus est
intention; omnis intellectus operativus incipit a fine. Keckerm. System. lib.
1. page 165.
intention, and that which first sets the mind on work about this or that:
thus in temporalls, so likewise in spiritualls. The Christian being able to
make use of his sanctified reason, can easily tell the intent of his heart, and
the end he aims at, especially having the word of God as a sure rule to go
by; he can tell whether he loves the brethren out of any by end he has, or
only as brethren, setting all other respects aside; And finding this holy
affection in himself, must needs conclude it cannot be in a man that does not
believe. I have heard of a very godly Minister, who (as I take it) being sick
to death was much troubled about his evidence, and doubted whether he did
belong to God or no? at the last, Well, says he, the devil shall never gull
me; I have one evidence will assure me without fail, I am certain I love Gods
people, and so gathered comfort: Upon these grounds I am bold to determine the
question affirmatively; That although Faith lies hid for the present, yet a man
from works of piety, and charity, which he finds in himself, may have
assurance that he does believe, and so is in the state of salvation.

In his conference, page 12. he does confess: Where unfeigned love to the
brethren is found, it may be a testimony of grace received; but he objects How
shall I know? (his answer is) That unless we believe truly, we cannot know we
love unfainedly, therefore though our love hear witness to our Faith before
men, yet our Faith bears witness to our love in the secrets of our heart;
neither can it ever appear to be true love, that proceeds not from a heart
first embracing Christ by Faith.

To this I answer, by my loving unfainedly I know I believe truly; the truth
of my work being an infallible evidence of the truth of my Faith; and I can
try my work by the sure rule of the Word which will not fail: and thus
though I cannot see my Faith formally, yet I can see it effectively, I mean in
its effective energie and efficacy. Again, our love does not only bear
witness to our Faith before men, but also to our selves, that we do believe;
our consciences telling us that it is such a love that must needs flow from
Faith, and be a fruit and effect of it. Good Opera bona tripliciter veniunt
consideranda: 1. Ratione materiae sive objecti circa quod versantur: 2. Ratione
originis ex qua procedunt. 3. Ratione finis, in quem fiunt. Laurent. com. in

works are to be considered; 1. In regard of the matter or object, about which
they are conversant. 2. In regard of the original, from which they do
proceed. 3. In regard of the end, for which they are done: Now who can judge of
the proper and formal object of a man's love to the brethren, whether grace be
it or no? or who can tell whether it flows from a sincere affection to grace
or no? or whether there be any by end or not? another man cannot judge, 1 Cor.
2.11. For what man knows the things of man, save the spirit of man which is
in him? by the Spiritus hominis significar substantialem hominis pattem, animum
seu intellectum, and conscientiam hominis, quae cuique certissime dictat, quid
in intimis cordis recessibus lateat, and quisque in sinu gerat. Pare. com. in
loc.
spirit we are to understand the substantial part of man, the mind, or
intellect, and conscience, which does certainly dictate and tell to every one,
what lies hid in the secret passages of his heart, and every thing that he
carries in his bosom; for the mind of man does not only understand those
things which are abroad, or man's outward actions; but his very inwards: And by
reflection upon it self, knows and understands that it understands it self.
And thus its plain, that no other can judge of a man's true love to the
brethren but his conscience and spirit; and the spirit sanctified, can by the
Word judge certainly, another but conjecturally. And thus you see our love
bears witness to our faith in the secrets of our heart, and does infallibly
evidence to us that we do believe: And my conscience evidences to me, that
this love could not be in my heart unless I had Faith, and our Savior tells
us, Mat. 25.40. Eleemosyna haec est quae Christum pascit esurientem in paupere,
Prosper. De promis. and praedict. Dei. par. 2. cap. 7.
Inasmuch as we embrace his Brethren, by acts of love, we embrace him in our
arms, which none can do without Faith.

In his conference, Page 13. he lays down this as a Note of love to the
brethren; If they be in poverty, to sell the whole or half of our possessions
and divide among them: The sick man propounds this question: Can I not love
them unless I sell my possessions, and divide among them? The Minister makes
answer, Verily no, for true love binds us not only to lay down our goods, but
our lives also where need requires. The sick man says, He has not loved
them thus: The Minister tells him, then he has loved them in word, not in deed;
in tongue, not in truth: And concludes, that few can by this mark be assured
of their salvation, because they come so far short of the precept and example
of our Lord. To this I answer, Cannot a man love the Brethren, unless he
actually sell the whole or half of his possessions; and divide among them? its
enough if he carry a mind to sell them if need require, which every good
Christian does, and will in case of necessity part with his estate and life too:

Page 14. In his conference he says, I do for the present believe, until I
shall see ground to the contrary, that Saint John does principally speak of
our assurance, whereby we know Nos scimus; quid nos scimus? quia transivimus de
morte ad vitam; undescimus? quia diligimus fratres Nemo. interroget hominem,
redeat unusquifque ad cor suum; si ibi invenerit Charitatem sraternam, securus
sit, quia transiit de motte ad vitam, Jam in dextra est. Aug. Expos. in Epist.
Joan. tract. 5. col. mihi 613. in fine.
one another to be the children of God: this shows he understands not the
meaning of this place, it being chiefly to be understood of the evidence we
have in our selves.

Page 15. I do affirm (says he) that he that has no greater witness in
himself, than love to the brethren, shall never attain to assurance of
Salvation: Mark how within the compass of three leaves he does say and unsay:
for Page 12. He does confess, unfeigned love to the brethren is a testimony of
grace received. Now whosoever has a testimony, that he has received Grace,
has assurance by this of his Salvation; it makes no matter whether the
Testimony he has be greater or less, so it be sound and true; and a Christian
in this case may argue (a minore ad majus) from the lesser to the greater, for
he that in Truth has this witness, is infallibly certain of the greater, and
may by this, know that he has that: I mean Faith: if by it, he understands
the greater. They are cursed speeches of the sick man, to say, Hell gapes for
him; he shall be damned; And cursed be the time that ever I laid a foundation
upon the sands. As though to affirm, that unfeigned love to the brethren is an
infallible note of true believers, were to lay a foundation upon the sands,
whereas the Apostle affirms as much.

Master Perkins speaking of the right way of ministering comfort to a party
distressed, lays this down for one ground, Namely, to love any man because he
is a Christian, and a child of God, is a sensible and certain note of a man
that is partaker of the true love of God in Christ: and he proves it by this
place we are upon, 1 John 3.14. Having laid down this ground, (says he) The
way whereby the party in distress, may be brought within the compass of the
promise of Salvation, stands in two things, in making trial, and applying of
the promise. First, when a man is in the fit of Tentation, he will say
resolutely, he is sure to be damned: Ask him in this fit, of his love to God,
he will answer, he has none at all: but ask him further; whether he love a
man because he is a Christian and a Child of God? then he will say, he does
indeed. In the second place, the applying of the promise of life everlasting to
the party distressed; And that is done by a kind of reasoning: The first part
whereof is taken from the Word of God: The second, from the testimony of the
distressed conscience; And the conclusion is the applying of the promise on
this manner: Major, Minor.
He that loves a man because he is a Christian and a child of God, is
certainly himself a true child of God. But thou love a man because he is a
Christian and a child of God: Therefore thou art a child of God, Conclus.
and art translated from death to life, as the Apostle speaks.

Another ground of comfort for a party distressed, Master Perkins lays down
from the unfaigned desire after grace, which he in his Conference, Page 3. and
in his Book, Page 74. does utterly reject. First (says Master Perkins) let
the comforter ask the party in distress, whether he believe, and repent? The
distressed party answers no, he cannot repent, nor believe: Then we must
further ask, whether he does desire to believe and repent? To this he will
answer, he does desire it with all his heart: Now for applying the promise to
the distressed, the Argument will run thus: He that has an unfeigned desire to
repent and believe, has remission of sins and life everlasting: Major. Minor.
Conelus.
But thou have an earnest desire to repent and believe in Christ: Therefore,
remission of sins and life everlasting is thine. Thus Master Perkins. But
that I may comfort the poor weak Christian against such Doctrine as this,
That such as do desire to believe, do not believe; I will conclude with an
Example I have read in the works of that famous Divine Master Greenham, who
tells of one Master Chambers of Leycester, who in his sickness grievously
despaired, and cried out that he was damned, and after dyed: yet it is not for
any to note him (says he) with the black mark of a reprobate. One thing
which he spoke in his extremity (O that I had but one drop of Faith!) must move
all men to conceive well of him: for by this it seems he had an heart, which
desired to repent and believe: And therefore, a repentant and believing heart
indeed. Blame me not for having a second bout at such Doctrine as this, so
destructive to poor distressed Consciences, so contrary to the Word of God,
and against the experience of every true broken hearted Christian. What
Doctrine soever tends to the vilifying of a sanctified life, is a Doctrine of
devils, though it appear as an Angel of light: And such as labor to make the
Law of God of no use (not so much as a rule of life) to a believer, do deny
the Kingly Office of Christ, and they are Antichrist: Now the Lord give us
broken hearts, that we may be low in our own eyes, and not be led by our own
humors: but that we may be guided by the Spirit of truth, according to the
word of Truth. I will present you with the golden chain of Salvation, and I
have done.

1. God has ordained. 2. Christ has merited. 3. The Word does promise. 4. The
Sacraments do seal. 5. Faith does receive. 6. The mouth does confess. 7.
Works do testify.
Now to God only wise, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be all praise, as is
most due, for evermore.

FINIS.
