THE SCOTCH SOLDIERS SPEECH CONCERNING THE KINGS Coronation Oath.



Printed in the Year, 1647.

THE Scotch Soldiers Speech, concerning the Kings Coronation Oath.
GEntlemen, and fellow Soldiers, though as a Scotchman I may be plain, and a
Soldier blunt, yet (I hope) as a Christian I shall be honest, and as a Subject
loyal in the expression of that duty, which by the Laws of God, of nature, of
the Kingdom, of gratitude, and of humanity is due to one, who is by Sovereign
Majesty our King, by birth our Countryman, by education a Protestant, by
profession, and actions a most pious Prince, and by his gracious compliance
with us confident in our loyalty; the confluence of which obligements has made
all the powers of heaven, and earth to stand as it were in amaze, being big
with expectations to see how well or ill we deport our selves in this business
of such high concernment. Who knows but that the divine providence has sent
his Majesty to us, that we might be made the happy instruments of a well
grounded peace, and of restoring Religion to its purity, the Church to its
Rights, the King to his Prerogative, and Laws to their channel, the Nobility,
and Gentry to their honors and estates, and the people to their Liberties: if
we resolve upon these things, we may crown our Nation with honor, but if
unworthy thoughts possess our souls, we may justly fear, that (although
salvation may come some other way,) yet we, and our party shall perish. It is
true that we have an hard game to play, but having the chief triumph trump in
our own hands, besides so many honors, we shall prove but ill Gamesters, if
we be not gainers by the deal, and give Religion and Justice their due,
besides the saving of our own stakes: but for the effecting hereof it
behooveth us to look with our own eyes, and not through those spectacles, or
prospectives through which others present matters unto us: we have hitherto
been made believe, that the end, and design of all this war was to fetch the
King from his evil Counselor to his Parliament of England; his Majesty very
often, (yea even beneath the dignity of so great a Prince) desired to comply
with them, but they instead of accepting his Majesty, voted him a prisoner; his
Majesty having honored us with his Royal presence, there are now no evil
Councillors about his, there are no Armies to animate his noncompliance: what
is now the rock of offense* believe it (all the circumstances of this War
considered) we may justly fear that we have been made but a stale to the
designs of those seditious Schismatics, who are now the obstacles of the
Kingdoms peace, and that they (like the Ape) made use of the Cats foot to
pluck those Chestnuts out of the fire, which themselves had designed for their
own palate; It behooves us now duly to examine the business, and we are bound
(according to the trust reposed in us by his Majesty) to vindicate his
Majesty's Rights, and to see her restored to all his legal Prerogatives: but
shall I tell you the true causes of this present difference, and that which we
may upon good grounds suspect to be the true occasion of this most horrid, and
unnatural War? His Majesty at his Coronation in England took an Oath in these
words: I will maintain, and preserve to you (the Bishops) and to the Churches
committed to your charges, all Canonical privileges, and I will be your
protector, and defender to my power, by the assistance of God, as every good
King in his Kingdom in right ought to defend the Bishops, and Churches under
their government: then (laying his hand on the book on the Communion Table) He
says, these things I have before promised I shall perform and keep, so help
me God, and the contents of this book. Here is an Oath able to strike terror
and amazement into the hearts of all, (the due circumstances there of being
considered) as well as fear and reverence in his Majesty about the performance
of the same: it is taken by Gods Anointed, in Gods House, at Gods Table, upon
Gods Book, tendered by Gods Ministers, to defend Gods Rights, in the presence
of Gods people, and that with the imprecation of Gods curses, and forfeiture of
Gods blessings; so that if ever any Oath could properly, by way of eminency, be
called the Oath of God, this is it: His Majesty therefore out of his Princely
piety (conceiving himself bound in duty to God, in honor to the Church, in
Justice to His Subjects, and in obedience to Christian principles to maintain
his Oath,) refuses to consent to the root and branch bills against the
Episcopacy: but some (whom I will not name) forgetful of his Majesty's honor,
and conscience, and resolving to execute their own designs in altring the
government of the Church, have raised a Militia, and called us into their aid,
thereby to force a compliance from his Majesty, and the Royal Party, with
them. And now what soul is not astonished? what heart does not bleed? whose
ears do not tingle? to hear that we (unhappy we) should, under the pretense
of holy Covenants, be made the instruments of such horrid impieties? What could
the devil, and all the fiends of hell have thought on more impious then
perjury? what more obnoxious to the Church of God then Sacrilege? what more
rebellious then by force of Arms to compel the King to both? what more
blasphemous to God, and scandalous to Christianity, then to do all these things
under the name and pretense of Religion? what, was God the God of truth when he
gave us the Precept of performing all our Vows, and is he now become the God of
Perjurie? did God detest the withholding of Tithes, and Offerings as robbery
done to himself, and is he now become a Patron of Sacrilege? did he enjoin
subjection to Superiors as to his own Ordinances, and that upon pain of
damnation, and is he now become a General to Rebels, whereby to force the King
against his Oath, and conscience? Hear o heavens, and hearken o earth, if ever
any such thing were committed, that a great Council of a Kingdom, of
Christians, of Protestants, of Subjects, of those that were sworn to defend the
Kings rights, should countenance tumults, connive at assaults upon his Majesty,
examine the circumstances of his birth to prove Bastardy in him, that thereby
they might remove him, and his Royal Posterity, from the Crown, raise a
Militia against him, vote him that he was seduced by evil Counsel, that he
sought the destruction of the Parliament, to bring in Popery, and to rule by an
arbitrary way, vote his Royal Consort to be guilty of high Treason for her
loyalty, murder his Nobility, destroy his Gentry, oppress his Subjects, wincke
at the blasphemous hew-and-cties of Britannicus, and vote his Majesty to
prison, because out of a pious, and princely resolution, he is fully bent to
maintain his Oath, rather to part from his life, and Crown, then from that
Religion, and Government, both in Church and State, which he is sworn, and
has so often deeply protested, and declared to maintain. Good God! what shall
we say to this? whether shall we cause our shame to slye? to whom shall we
appeal for excuses? shall we ascend up into heaven for them? Lo there we
shall find all the Saints, and Angels of God, who continually behold the face
of their heavenly Father, detesting those new doctrines of forcing the Kings
conscience contrary to his Oath; as such whereof all the Patriarchs, and
Prophets, and Martyrs of God were formerly ignorant. Shall we appeal unto men?
behold Ireland conquered, our own Country up in Arms, the greatest part of
the Nobility, and Gentry, and all the heads of the Universities, together with
the learned part of the Clergy of England, detesting our actions with as much
abomination, as ever the Egyptians hated the profession of Shepherds: and if we
had put the case at the election of the Parliament members, if the King will
not, contrary to his Oath taken at his Coronation, consent to the pulling down
of Episcopacy, and alteration of the Church Government, whether or no it be the
Subjects minds by force of Arms to compel him thereunto, contrary to his Oath
and conscience, all people would have been ready to stone us, as not thinking
it possible that such horrid impieties should enter into the hearts, or
thoughts of the great Council of the kingdom; and certainly if we had
ingenuously confessed the truth at first, without the cloak of a thorough
Reformation, or of fetching evil Councellers from the King, we should never
have raised so great a power: and if we look beyond the Seas, we are accounted
the shame of Christians, and the scorn of Christianity, yea even all Protestant
Churches (when they are really informed, against what principles we have
proceeded) will hate, and detest our actions: shall we ransacke the sacred
Scriptures? I have showed you before against what divine precepts we have
proceeded, but behold there indeed the pure fountains of living water
blundred, and abused for the justification of our cause; when one shall tell
us, that we may fight against our King, because it is written, Thou shall bind
their Kings in chains, and their Nobles with linckes of Iron: Another
(blaspheming the King with horrid slanders) shall conclude that Tophet was
prepared of old, yea for the King it was prepared: And a third (as though he
would fore-prophecye of the Kings destruction) says, though Jeconiah were the
signet upon my right hand, yet will I pluck him from thence: Are not these
horrid things, such as would make a dumb man speak, and a wise man dumb with
horror and amazement? If (fellow Soldiers) you intend to be ruled by the
Scripture, let me put you a Scripture-case; in Saul's seeking to make havocke of
the Gibeonites, contrary to the Oath given them, you may observe, how this Oath
was obtained by fraud, and a lie; that it was expressly against the Covenant of
Promise given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and afterward to Moses, Aaron, and
the people; that it was given rashly without asking counsel of God, and to a
people by Nation heathens, by Religion Idolaters, and by condition vassals, to
be drawers of water and hewers of wood; that what Saul did was at the least 300
years after the Oath given, in which time that Oath may seem to some to be
antiquated; and that he did it in zeal to the people of Israel; But what the
success? the blood of the men shed by reason of this perjury cried aloud to
heaven for vengeance; Gods ears were opened to their cries, he punishes the
whole Land with Famine, and would not be paci^ied but with the hanging up of
almost all Saul's Posterity: are not these things written for our instruction?
and what judgments (think we) shall attend us if we force the King to violate
that Oath, which his Majesty took by the Laws of the Kingdom, for the
preservation of Gods, and the Churches Rights, shall we then look within us,
and there make boasts of the Spirit? but if Gods Word be the trial of the
Spirit, that Spirit which is repugnant to the Word of God cannot be the Spirit
of God; Gods Spirit comes to us in Truth not in Perjury, in meekness, in the
form of a Dove, not of an Eagle, or with Vultures tallons to steal flesh from
the Altar; and we know this to be the difference between the spirit of Truth,
and the spirit of Error, that Truth desires nothing but the arms of
righteousness, the arms of Prayer, and tears, and the Sword of the Spirit,
which is the Word of God: to fight for the profession: hereof against their
lawful Kings, the Doctrines of setting Kingdom against Kingdom, and Nation
against Nation, by foreign Wars, and of setting the Father against the Son,
and the Son against the Father by civil dissentions, are the Doctrines of
those false Christ's, who shall deceive many, and are reserved for the worst of
times, to be maintained by the worst of men, who by their boasting of the
Spirit, fill the Church with Heresies, and Schisms, the Kingdom with
Rebellion, and the world with confusion: shall we plead the Votes, and Orders
of the Parliament of England, or the National Covenant? what were this, but
under pretense of pulling down Popery to set up Idolatry, and to lay aside all
the Laws of God for the Covenant, and for the Votes and Orders of the Houses?
but if the Covenant be to maintain Religion, and the Kings honor, we shall
then truly perform the Covenant in both, when we detest those Doctrines, and
actions, that dishonor God, and the King, by accursed Perjury; and that were a
Covenant with hell that should covenant to force the King to forswear
himself. But tell me, (I pray you) is it the Votes, and Orders of the Houses,
and the Covenant, or the Commandments of God that shall justify or condemn
us the last day? shall we plead the Laws of England? but (I pray you) what
Laws can be of force to mate themselves against the Laws of God? and what
Laws of the Kingdom were ever produced to justify the raising of a Militia,
and the calling in of Foreign aid, and joining in Covenants, thereby to force
the Kings violation of his Coronation Oath? Again (if we believe them that are
professed in those Laws) they lay this as a maxim, that no Law, Statute, or
Custom, which is either against the Law of God, or Principles of Nature, can
be of any validity, or force, but are void, and null in Law; they say further,
that therefore this Oath was by the Fundamental Laws and constitutions of the
Kingdom presented to his Majesty of purpose to bind his conscience to preserve
the Ecclesiastical Rights, for the comfort, and encouragement of true Piety,
and Learning: that as the Laws, and Statutes of Articuli Cleri, and other
records should bind the hands of the subjects, so this Oath should bind the
conscience of the King from violating the Churches Rights: and therefore it is
expressed as a several Article in the Coronation Oath, that the King should
never assent to any Act, that should trench upon their Rights, and that
howsoever the Kings conscience was at liberty to consent to the alteration of
any other of the municipall laws, yet it should be bound as to this by the
especial and direct words of the Oath; as likewise his Majesty is bound by the
words of that Oath, to do justice to all: and therefore by virtue of this
Oath, as well as of honor and Justice, if the Houses tender any Bills which
his Majesty conceives to be against common right, or Justice, his Majesty is
bound not to give his Majesty's Royal assent thereunto, which cannot but
strike amazement in all knowing men, that any should be so impudently wicked,
as against all the lights of God, of Nature, and the Kingdom to try the King
with perjury, because he will not consent to the root and branch bills against
Episcopacy; and the Royal party desires no other happiness then to be
admitted to a full and free disputation upon that point; and that their reasons
might be published in all Churches, and declared to all the world, for the
justification of his Majesty's and their innocencies in this cause. Against
this shall we plead the pride and arrogancy of the Bishops and Clergy? but I
fear this will be with greater pride; suppose some Bishops and Clergy exalt
themselves against some of Gods people, must we therefore exalt our selves
against God, and Gods Anointed? because some Bishops are proud, must ye
subjects therefore take up Arms to force the King to perjury, and sacrilege?
let their insolences be punished, but let Gods and the Churches Rights
remain. It is granted that some of the Clergy by the irregularitie of their
actions, and laying clogges upon men's consciences, gave a great scandal to the
Church, but these might be legally proceeded against; and what innovations they
had brought in contrary to law might have been reformed; but must therefore the
function, contrary to all the principles of Religion, Law, and reason, be
rooted out? because there was a Judas amongst the Apostles, did Christ take
away the Apostleship? because many Angels did rebel against God, did God
destroy the whole Hierarchy? Suppose some Bishops sought to set themselves the
one at the right hand of the King, the other at his left, as James and John did
at Christ's; must their ambition cause all to be despised? If God should root
out all mankind, because some are most refractory wicked persons, what would
become of us? the doctrines of rooting out all for the abuses of some, are
agreeable neither to the precept, nor pattern of him, who will have the wheat
and ta^es grow together till the harvest: and it has formerly been accounted
the wisdom of Parliaments to reform abuses by regulating, not by
extirparton. But yet what has the righteous done? whose eyes are so swelled
with pride, or blinded with malice, that do not see how many Saints of God
there were both of the Bishops, Doctors, and other Clergy, who willingly laid
down their lives for that Cause, and Religion, which his Majesty does now
maintain* and for us to say, that if they had lived in these days, they would
have ended with us, is a speech as full of arrogancy, as ignorance, and
expressly against all their actions; and how many are there of their successors,
who, before this unhappy difference, were men famous in their generations, and
have now none other fault but their constancy to their Religion, and their
loyalty to their King? shall we then justice our Cause, for that God has gone
along with our Armies? o poor miserable creatures if we have no better then
such fig leaves to cover our nakedness! because God does often bless the
adulterous seed, is he therefore either the cause, or lover of adultery? if we
have nothing but the power of the sword for the justification of our Cause, by
this title, the blasphemies of Mahomet in the Alcoran, and the dotages of the
Popish superstitions in the Legend may lay claim to heaven as well as we: but
what if God out of the heat of his wrathful indignation toward us, have (as
he uses to do to those whom he gives over to a reprobate sense) given us the
victory, thereby to obdurate us in our rebellion, that through pride of heart,
and vain conceit of a just Cause, we might be made more incapable of
repentance, and pardon? It is true, that God has had a controversy with the
English, and we for their sins may be made the rod of Gods anger in punishing
the King, and all his Royal party; but we know not how soon for our own
sins God may throw this rod into the fire. Perchance you will say, that the
King in taking away the Churches Rights should do no more, then what he
himself in part, and his Royal Predecessors have formerly consented unto: but
who knows not, that his Majesty never willingly agreed to the abrogation of
any of the Churches dues; and if his pious heart smite him for cutting off the
lap of their skirts, must he be forced to strip them as naked as the young man
that left his linen garment behind him? and who knows not that all those
Kings, who have been regardlesse of their Oaths in taking away the Churches
Rights, have been pursued by the hand of Justice, so that there is not so much
as the name, or posterity of any of them remaining? and who knows but that
those acts of impiety might be amongst those crowdes of sins, which have
cried so loud for judgment against these Kingdoms? But shall we say that this
Oath is an evil Oath, and so evil in the taking, and worse in the keeping?
this were to cast dirt upon the face of the whole constitution of that Church,
and State of that kingdom which appointed the tenure of this Oath to his
Majesty. But wherein (I pray you) does the malignity of this Oath consist?
suppose that there were now a Parliament of Papists, who would take up arms
under pretense of a through Reformation, and of voting all Protestants that
should side with the King, as evil Counselors, and of fetching the King from
them to his great Council, should not we that are Protestants stand up in his
Majesty's justification? should not we abominate the violating of these laws
of God, of nature, and of the Kingdom, under the pretense of the power of the
great Council, as Jesuiticall impostures? is it unlawful for the King to
break his Oath for any Votes, Orders, or Ordinances of Popish Parliaments and
shall Protestants now do that which they so much detest in Papists? but if
there be any that will plead for Baal let them stand up, and produce their
strong reasons, let the case be truly stated to the Assembly of Divines, and if
they have any new Directories for the regulating of the Kings conscience
against his Oath, as well as for thrusting the Apostles Creed out of the
Church, let them be published to the world, that all Christians may judge how
Orthodoxe they are. First let them resolve whether or no the King (not
withstanding the taking of this oath) be bound to take away the Churches
rights? and whether or no (like so many Popes) they or the Houses have power to
dispense with Oaths, and to nullify them at their pleasure. Secondly, if the
King will not bend his conscience to be warped into Perjury, by the scorching
heat of their zeal, whether or no it be lawful for the Subjects to raise a
Militia, and to call us in to their aid to force the King thereunto, and
whether or no it be rebellion so to do? Thirdly, where the King is pursued
because he will not commit Perjury, whether or no the Subjects by that account
which they are to give to God, by the duty which they owe to the King, and by
the Oaths of Allegiance which they have taken, be not bound to stand up in his
Majesty's aid, for the vindication of his Majesty's honor, and conscience?
Fourthly, where the Subjects do upon these grounds engage themselves in his
Majesty's service, whether or no it be according to the rules of Religion, or
Justice, to vote, or publish them to be enemies to God, and all Godliness,
Papists, popishly affected, Traitors to the King, enemies to their Country,
disturbers of the Peace, and such like? Fifthly, whether or no all those
Clergymen that have taken the Oaths of Canonical obedience, and to maintain
the discipline, and government of the Church; all those of the Laity that have
taken the Oaths of Offices, of trusts and of allegiance, can justify the
violation of those Oaths, to comply with the two Houses, in forcing his
Majesty to violate this? Sixthly, whether or no all the laws of God, and man,
which justify, and vindicate the Kings Rights, and conscience, are to be
esteemed as void and null in Law; And whether or no all the blood shed in this
most horrid and unnatural war shall be imputed to them, who seek to vindicate
his Majesty's honor, and conscience, or to those, who (under pretense of a
through Reformation, and of fighting against evil Counselors) give the King so
many battles, and turn these Kingdoms into so many Acheldama's, filling them
not only (as Manasses did Jerusalem) with blood from one end to the other, but
also with so many Perjuries, Sacriledges, and horrid Blasphemies? If the
Assembly of Divines be ashamed to own these accursed impieties, why should not
we be ashamed to defend those things by our Swords, which they are ashamed to
justify with their Pens? I think impiety is not yet grown to that height of
impudency, that any man dare dispute these questions, in the discussing whereof
it will appear, that, if all the Precepts of Divinity were taken out of the
Word of God, all the dictates of reason blotted out of the Book of nature, and
all the maxims spunged out of the Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom, which
have been violated in the justification of this War against the King, there
would be neither Scripture, Reason, nor Law left us how to walk as Christians,
Men, or Subjects: but if there be any whose desperate condition has sold him
(like Ahab) to work wickedness before the Lord, and to plead for the violation
of the Kings Oath, that were not only to sharpen the Tongues and Pens of men,
but even the Arrows of Gods judgments against us, and our cause, and to make
the enemies of God to blaspheme Religion, yea to expose our selves, our
Kingdoms, our Religion, and all that we have, to the contempt and scorn of all
nations, and Religions whatsoever. What Kingdom can with safety, enter into a
League, or confederacy with our King; what foreign Nation can with security
rely upon the honesty of our Merchants; what Religion will not fear to hold
Communion with such a Religion, or Nation, whose Principles, either in
Religion, or State, maintain, that the Subjects may take up arms to force the
King contrary to his Oath, yea his Coronation Oath? how often have our Pulpits
rung, that faith is to be kept with Heretics, and shall now the Subjects take
up arms to force the King to Perjury? Lord, what shall I say? Is the Council
of Trent now removed into Henry the Sevenths Chapel? Is the Popes Chair at
Rome changed into the Speakers Chair at Westminster? must our new reformed
Religion be founded upon the four corner stones of Blasphemy, Perjury,
Sacrilege, and Rebellion? and shall we temper the mortar thereof with the
blood; and tears of his Majesty's loyal people, of our fellow Subjects, of
our Brethren, and of those, who live, and dye in the same faith of Christ with
our selves? I tremble to think what the event of these things may be though we
have hitherto escaped the sword, I pray God that a Serpent out of the wall do
not bite us: If it were taken so ill that the late Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury, and some other Counselors of State should alter the Kings Oath in
some circumstances (the substance of the Oath still remaining) how ill will it
be taken that we should rise in arms to force the Kings conscience against
this Oath? but admitting it had been but a private Oath, nay if a wicked Oath,
and his Majesty's conscience had led him to take and defend the same, what
Doctrine is there in the Scripture that inables the subjects to rise in
rebellion against him for it? we may now see the Scaene of the Churches stage
strangely altered; the Church, and true Religion formerly suffered persecution
by the tyranny of Kings; but now Kings (yea pious Kings) suffer persecution by
the tyranny of Religion: these these and such like arguments are those rocks
upon which the Royal party has built their judgment; who, although they be
overcome by the sword, are not yet vanquished in their cause; for which they
make their appeals to heaven, and call God and man to witness their
innocence, rejoicing in nothing more, then that there will be a day of
Judgment, when the righteous, and impartial Judge shall judge both them, and
us according to the justice and innocence of the cause: in the mean time, now
that God has done with them, who knows (...) he may begin with us, and call
us to an account? Let us therefore hasten on the peace, thereby to prevent
those clouds of blood, which threaten to dissolve themselves upon us in fire,
and haile-stones; let us lay the foundation thereof in heaven, by rooting out
those accursed doctrines of sedition, which have watered our furrows with so
much blood; let us by a general Council chosen out of all the Provinces
within his Majesty's dominions, according to the ancient, and known Laws of the
3 several Kingdoms, restore religion to its purity of doctrine, and the
Church to its unity of discipline: but for us to think of a Reformation by
faction and rebellion, and to talk of Religion whilst we hold up our swords to
force the Kings conscience to perjury, is to blaspheme, not to maintain
Religion: and yet, as one absurdity opens the door to a thousand more, and one
sin makes way for another, I have heard some of our leven, (finding that they
have done what they could by the sword, and all to no purpose) think to cover
the shame of this tenent with a worse; and (as David thought to cover his
adultery by murder,) so these would cover their murder by adulterating the
Church of God, and would cloak the forcing of the Kings conscience by arms,
with proceeding against him by Ecclesiastical censure; but was ever any
heretic so blasphemously impudent, as to talk of a tradatur Satanae against
their King, because he will not perjure himself to commit sacrilege and
Apostasy: this were to deliver our selves not the King to Satan, and to burn
our selves in hell for thus blaspheming God, and the King, whilst his Majesty
signs his Halelujahs in heaven; the curse causeless shall not come, and the
arrows that we shall shoot against him will fall upon our own heads: this was
not it for which his Majesty put himself upon our loyalty: If the King would
have been forced against his conscience, he needed not to have hazarded either
his life, or Crown, or to have committed himself to our trust, he could have
forsworn himself without our counsel, or compulsion; let us take heed that
we make not a prey of that dear, which flies to us for succor from the
Hunts-mans hounds. Let us pour balm into the wound of the three Kingdoms, by
vindicating his Majesty's honor, and conscience, and by restoring the King,
his Royal Consort, the Prince, the Church, and the other subjects to their
lawful Rights; so shall we by giving unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's,
and unto God the things that are Gods, truly make a covenant with heaven by our
Religion, and Justice; and we may make up all the breaches of dissension by an
happy union; God may be pacified toward us; we may prevent the plots of future
designs; obtain honor with all Christian Princes; and be restored to our
own homes, with the plentiful reward of Religion, Justice, and Loialty.

Finis coronat Opus.
