TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE Isaac Pennington, Lord Major of the most Famous City
of London.
Right Honorable,
YOur Honor being the chiefest Treasurer of the Weal-publicke of this City, I
amongst the subscriptions and contributions of well affected persons, have in
this Book, like the Widow, offered into your Treasury but only two mites of
Service and Duty, and for it do most humbly pray your gracious favor, and
your Honors good acceptance. I know it will appear strange unto some, who if
they dislike my industry, and distaste my zeal, I esteem them only tanquam
pedarios sensores, trampling on the truth of the Cause, and carrying their eyes
in their heels, and not in their heads, kicking and spurning at all zealous
and well affected Patriots. But those malignant humors are so far from me,
and my intents, that in publishing this book, I have scattered abroad the fire
of my zeal to show it self in its own shine, and placed my happiness in
your Honors approving my endeavors. I have verily cast into your Treasury as
much as I could, and for my part do judge it every man's part to depart from
all where he owes all that is for the good and safety of the Commonwealth and
the City, which to advance your Honor has, and does most Religiously and
stoutly endeavor. To this I can only add my daily prayers, and will still
power them forth to the God of all glory and mercy, that his manifold and daily
blessings may be multiplied upon your Honor, for your great viligilancy and
care over this great City in these imminent times of Danger, while I desire
your approbation of this testimony of my zeal to your Honor, and presume to
subscribe myself, your Honors most humble servant,

W. S.

My Lord,
THE happy maintaining of truth in His Majesty's Dominions, is the great and
most honorable employment of all Subjects, but especially of those unto whom
the good of the Subject is in a more peculiar manner entrusted, that are so
many Patres Patriae, so many Fathers of their Country to dispose and defend
the Rights, Privileges, and Interests of their Country, and the liberties of
the Subject; such are the two honorable Houses of Parliament, and all
Magistrates who ought to comply with His Majesty, so far as His Majesty does
comply with truth; and truth is defined to be conformitas rei cum intellectu,
the conformity of any thing with the understanding. Now in matters of Religion,
the will of God is the object of the understanding, so that if the intellect or
understanding be not rightly informed and conformed to Gods revealed will and
word, that Religion is false and erroneous, and such are the Idolatrous
opinions of the Papists, being conformed only to the will of humane traditions
and inventions, altogether repugnant to the Doctrine of Christ, and his
Apostles.

And if the Delinquents who now swarm in Arms about the King, have by force
and evil counsel raised an unhappy division under fair pretenses of Religion,
which they intend to overthrow, and will maintain Idolatry to be truth, the
violation of all Laws divine and humane to be truth, sint omnia protinus alba,
let all things, even black it self be called white. But if these Delinquents,
and Malignants did in the first place sow private seeds of dissension between
the King and His Parliament, and in vulgus spargere semina, and afterward
dispersed them amongst the vulgar people; if they by pernicious counsel drew
first His Majesty's affection, then His Person away from the Parliament, then
banded themselves into a great Army against the Parliament, against the
Subject, and most especially against the Protestant Religion, whose ruin they
had formerly contrived; and finding that all their intentions were by divine
providence blown away, like the venomous work of the Spider, in publicum
exitiosi, nihil spei, nisi per discordias habent, tamen, Deus and Rex, and
pretiosa nomina praet exuntur, they are Tacitus his words with little
alteration; these men destructive to the Commonwealth, had no hope to bring
about their Idolatrous and wicked intents, but by pretending those precious
names of God and the King, as standing in their defense, when indeed they
oppose both, seeing none can stand for God and the King truly and lawfully,
unless he stand also for the good of the Subject, of the maintenance of the
Protestant Religion.

Truth does not consist in any duality of good and evil, of right and wrong,
of real and counterfeit, of verbal and substantial, but like a dye thrown
by the hand of adversity, or powerful opposition does always set upon a
square, it is one and the same still like it self, and therefore indeed it is
good, because it is always one; thus with God who is all goodness, there is
no shadow of alteration or changing; but the Devil and his works are
multiplicia, fallacia, and therefore malignantia, so the malignants of these
times give out that they fight for God, but indeed their meaning is fallacious,
for they intend being delinquents to keep themselves from the censure of the
Law, they would erect again their superstitious Idolatry, and make the land
groan again under monopolies and arbitrary taxations, they would enjoy the
liberty of their own wicked dissoluteness, and would have no reformation of
Religion, lest they should be compelled to a conformation thereunto, and
therefore stand neither for God nor the King, but for their own manifold
private ends, and are malignants to God, the King, and the whole State of the
Kingdom.

The question being thus stated between the malignants, and those who stand for
the maintenance of the true Gospel, and the King, as far as he stands for the
truth, and is conformable thereunto, it does appear how and by whom the
Kingdom is now distracted, the truth shows it self, we are conformable to
God, first seeking his glory, and then the honor of the King, who cannot be
the Kinst of malignants and true Protestants, and therefore we are true
obedient subjects unto his Majesty, in endeavoring to divide those evil
counselors from him, and to bring the King and his Subjects to a religious
unity consisting of many parts, as the Laws divine and humane, the just
privilege of the Subject, by a free and legal government, together with the
privileges of Parliament, all which these malignants endeavor utterly to
subvert and destroy.

Et si hoc in arido, quid in vindi? If this be done (ex facto) by the children
of this world unto an evil and malignant end, may not his Majesty's great
Council the Parliament (fas est ab host doceri) (ex jure) for the undoubted
good of the children of light, and the honor of his Majesty, defend the true
Protestant Religion, the Kings lawful Power, the just liberties of the
Subject, and the privileges of Parliament, and may not Magistrates (your
Honor being the chief moderator and governor of this honorable City) comply
with the Parliament, in standing for the glory of God, the defense of the King,
and the maintenance of divine and humane Rights.

It is most certain, that this honorable City of London, though much
distracted and disquieted, has in her greatest fears and jealousies, Anchora
fluctuanti Civitati, the Anchor of your Honors wisdom to keep the City,
though tossed on the waves of dissension, fast to the faith of Christ, alter and
optimus Tiphis, another and an excellent governor, and chief Master of the
Cities ship; so that as Lelius for wisdom, Metellus for piety, Aristides for
justice, were all commended in Roman Histories: so the ancient images of
excellent men, were but paternes and resemblances of man's contracted and
complete virtues united in your Honor, being the Atlas of the City, bearing
the weight and management of all civil affairs on your Honors shoulders: And
therefore, though magnanimity only was attributed to Cyrus, only modesty to
Agesilaus, only wisdom to Themistocles, skill to Philip, and boldness to
Brasidus; yet Alexander, as Plutarch reports, was furnished and full fraught
with all these: So your honorable Lordship is known to be magnanimous, in
standing for the defense of the true religion, modest and courteous toward
delinquents and offenders, merciful and compassionate to the distressed, wise
and judicious both in politic and divine matters, and courageously bold,
maugre all opposition, to stand in defense of the true Protestant Religion, and
the policy of the City whereof you are the governor, and not only Major, but
Optimus; and yet such is your Honors magnanimous patience, that you are put or
diverted from your resolutions, by the left handed and popular voice, your
honor can, as Tacitus says, aequo animo laceratam far existimationem, your
Honor can oppose the malignitie of the times with an invincible patience and
magnanimity, knowing that the aim of your desires is the truth and glory of God.

But what do I speak of passive virtue? Your actions carry in them the most
lively portraiture of an able, honest mind: and though your Honor may think,
nec ille te novit, qui laudavit, nec tu illum, yet we should be all ashamed,
quasi canes, latratu accipere quem non agnoscimus, to bark at those we do not
know; yet what Scholar, nay, what Plebeian can be ignorant of your great care
and vigilancie for the City: for though they watch in vain, if God keep not
the City, yet the eyes of the Cities have been infallible witnesses of your
good propension and inclination to the safety of the City; so that we may
say, Come and see the legible characters of the honorable Majors fidelity,
love and loyalty to the City, in taking order, by direction from the great
Council of the Honorable Parliament, for the building of those great, strong,
and serviceable fortifications near and about the City of London, Speque,
fideque inquit Majora videbis. The Protestant faith, and the goodness of the
cause now undertaken, promises greater works: For,

Causa jubet superos meliora sperare secundas. And here I wish that I had as
many eyes as Argus, to discover the great cost bestowed upon these works; they
are raised to a great height, according to the best advantages of Geometrical
proportions, there is earth heaped upon earth, compacted together according to
the dimensions of Art: so that every Fortification, pondere tuta suo est, is
strong by the weight and worth of the work. My Lord, I will not here set before
you the absolute Model of these fortifications, which are well enough known
unto your Lordship, and how many emergent reasons to magnify and praise your
Lordship for your fidelious care of the City. My Lord, actions are acknowledged
to be the essence of virtue wherein it consists, these works proceed from the
mighty working of Gods Spirit in your heart, from your piety and constant
resolution to defend the Protestant Religion, and your constancy in opposing
those malignants that would destroy the King, the Kingdom, and the Parliament,
your Honor, nay all the City, if they could get access, or make an in rode
thereinto.

But your Honor has in these dangerous times, when ruin and destruction does
threaten the Kingdom, and especially the City, when the true Protestant
Religion is deserted by many, and scandalized by other Malignants, your Honor
does not respect the opposition of Man, though dressed with the flourish and
pomp of Majesticall words; and yet herein lies your greatest, that you ascribe
all praise unto God the Lord of Hoasts, which works with wonderful wisdom,
and brings excellent things to pass. Religion is not unlike the soul in the
body of man: for in the whole Commonwealth it is or should be wholly and every
part thereof, tota in toto and tota in qualibet part: it has showed your
Honor the way for common good, and it should direct all the parts of the
Commonwealth to be compliable for the good of the Commonwealth, and not to
hang backward when any matter of cost or charge propounded for the defense and
fortification of the City: for all such are Hosts intra muros, enemies within
the walls.

Every Magistrate, especially Majors of Cities, are to reduce the City into
one Monarchical government, to take care of it, pace quam bello, for a wise
man is a rich man, a very King and an Emperor, and ought to take care of the
people under his charge, as if the King himself were present: For Monarchy
has several parts subordinate thereunto, whose ends are the same, namely, to
distribute justice, both in reward and punishment, unto the deserving; to see
the Laws executed, and by them to keep the subject from wrong or molestation:
But if Laws are silent, and a City, as this of London, be threatened by a
malignant party, as it is now, so that En and ecce venit Rex cum siccariis,
behold the King and his Cavaliers are coming, is the daily voice and
imagination of the people: then the Mayor, as your Honor has most piously
done, ought to fortify the walls of Jerusalem, to look that strength may be
provided to oppose the enemy: And herein your care and vigilance have declared
themselves. Your Honor has heard how other Cities and great Towns have been
plundered by the malignant party, and how earnestly they demonstrate their
cruelty upon the famous City of London; but your Honor has taken advice of
the Parliament, a way to oblige posterity unto your Honor: For though we have
indeed none that fights for us, but thou, O God, yet these Bulworkes and
Fortifications made round about the City, shall glorify your Name to
posterity, shall make your honor to be accounted the Defender of true
Religion, and the preserver of the whole body of this City; Men, women and
children, shall and are glad to see such fortifications raised for the defense
of the City, and do bless your Honor for your great care of the City.

The Sleepers in Sardos (Arist. Phys.) when they awaked, thought they had
passed no time; but we shall be more drowsy and sottish then they, if we now
open not our eyes to acknowledge how happy we are in your Lordships care and
vigilance over the City; and therefore I may say by a British Palingenesia, as
Hypolitus was called Virbius, so your Honor may be styled, Londini civitatis
Ulysses, Themistocles, or by any other name famous for loving and providing for
the security and safety of the City wherein they were governors. The City
does acknowledge it self to have been happy in many great Benefactors, some
whereof have erected Schools, and endowed them for the propagation of good
literature: Others have made their bounty flow out of Aquaducts and Conduits.
Some have founded Hospitalls for maimed impotent people, and given them large
revenews; but what has their ends of their actions been? To be accounted
famous and munificent, hiding their sins under the roof of an hospital; and it
may be, these great and glorious works were but splendida peccata, shining
sins. But your Lordship moved only with a right godly affection to the cause
of Religion, has provided for the safety and protection of this honorable
City of London: These out-workes speak your love to the Cities good and
preservation, to the true essence of Religion, to the Parliament and the whole
Kingdom and Estate, so that it may be said:

Major es quam cui pos^it maligna n^cere,
Turba --
Xenophon calls Magistrates the Kings eyes, the Kings cares, shoulders, feet
and hands; not because they should see nothing but what the King pleases, and
like and approve of that, or that they should hear nothing but the evil
counsel of malignants, or that they should catch and snatch one from the
other, or carry fire in the one hand, and water in the other; or with the one
to offer a gift, and with the other a stab to whom the King pleases, altera
manu panem, altera lapidem; but that Magistrates eyes, ears, shoulders, feet
and hands, should be mutual helpers one to the other, for the common good and
public service of the whole State; and herein your Honor has showed your
self an excellent Magistrate, complying with the Parliament in all matters
that concern the public administration of the Commonweal; so that you have
looked upon the present state of this City and Religion, with the clear eye of
justice; you have heard of the great pressures which the country has endured
by the cruelty of the Cavaliers; you have to the discouragement of malignants,
on the shoulders of fortitude, bore and suffered their false aspersions, and
aequo animo lacer atam far existimationens, is as Tacitus says, the true
note and property of a wise man; and your honor has in your present
Magistracy walked uprightly, having clean and pure hands; nay, strong hands:
for your Honor has been the chiefest raiser and promoter of the works and
fortifications round about the City of London; you saw the times were
dangerous, and that the Kings Cavaliers g^ped after nothing more then to get
London, and make it a prey to the supplying of their necessities. This made the
Parliament and your Lordship to take order for the fortification of the City,
to prevent the malice of our enemies, who marching under the name of the King,
would destroy both the City and the Kingdom.

Nature witty in policy, has given to all creatures a natural instinct to
fortify and preserve themselves, ad conservationem specierum, the earth has
mountains to keep off the fierce invasions of the North wind, the Heavens are
fortified (...), so that no malignant vapors can ascend higher then the middle
region, and man is fortified by his inward virtues and spiritual graces, nurus
adherens esto uil consoire sibi, your Lordship is thus fortified in your own
person, but this City which is the heart of the Kingdom is by your Lordships
care and vigilance fortified with warlike works, whereby your great care and
love to the City does most evidently appear.

Even from the beginning of this cruel Civil War, your Honor being armed
with the complete armor of Righteousness, have cheerfully stood in defense of
the City, and the true Protestant Religion, and the whole State, wherein the
Parliament and your Honor have procceded with an invincible constancy and
magnanimity, for in magnis rebus (...) nunquam tents aut perfice, matters of
State are not slightly to be intended but perfected, and I believe that all the
honorable Members of the Houses think every one of themselves are employed,
consulere de Religione, and incommunem (...) salutem, and how can this be
better manifested then by fortifying the City on every side with Bulwarks and
fortifications? and it is the Cities happiness now it these great times of
danger, that the Parliament and your Honor have so carefully provided for the
Cities safety, which thing pleased well Marcus Furius Camillus Dictator of Rome,
who seeing all the Senate and Subjects of Rome, not only accord in the common
execution of each office for common good of all, but willingly and lovingly
both highest and meanest to provide for the security of the City, which he said
was happy; si tales vires in Magistratu habeat in salutem Civitatis tam
concordibus junctos animis: the saying of Camillus is now verified concerning
the City of London; the Parliament and your Honor, together with all well
affected Subjects in the City, have complied together to fortify this famous
City from the imminent danger of the enemy, and more especially the City must
look on your Honor as the rationale propugnaculum Civitatis, who by counsel,
advice and wisdom, are a rational fortification to this City, defending it by
your piety, and true profession of the Gospel, for God often passes over the
punishment of the wicked for the righteous sake; and moreover you have,
together with the Parliament, provided for the general security of the City,
that children which shall be borne hereafter, may as soon as they get their
tongues pray for your Honor: for should the enemy get entrance into this City,
there would be nothing but ruin and desolation in the streets thereof, while
men, women and children were sacrificed to the fury of the sword: your Honor
therefore deserves the Cities unfeigned approbation and praise for raising and
advancing those praiseworthy works, and fortifications round about the City
of London; if they regard their children, wives, or any thing that is dear
unto them, they must bless your Lordship, who by your pious provision for the
City, and your pious profession of the true Protestant Religion, do shine like
the Sun in his sphere of the City, and are therein the high treasurer of the
Weale-publicke, your authority being beautified with justice in executing
Laws, with wisdom for determining right, with mercy and compassion for
releeving the distressed, and this is the glorious abundant treasure of your
honorable mind, which God has fortified with graces, and illuminated with
understanding for the common good and benefit of this honorable City.

FINIS.
