A SPEECH Spoken to his Excellency the LORD GENERAL MONK, BY ONE Representing
the Genius of ENGLAND at Drapers-Hall, Wednesday the 28. of March.
NOW almost twenty years have roul'd about
Since first the flames of our late Wars broke out;
And Britain fainting with the loss of blood
Under a lawless Yoke subjected stood,
When now at last her groans by Heaven are heard
Her fainting Soul and dying Hopes uprear'd;
Her sable night of sorrow done away
By the new dauning of a Royal day,
As from the North her first distemper grew,
Thence flows the Sovereign Medicine to renew
Her joys again: She hop^s secure to stand
Upheld by her brave Generall's Warlike hand.
Over the British Seas flies his great Name
Bor^ on the swift wings of no common fame,
Our Enemies tremble, and our friends are glad
To these it is joyful news, to those it is sad
The mighty shouts and the Stentorian voice
Of the glad multitude that now rejoice
Awak's the drowsy Genius, if this I Will,
Who wept so long over Charles's Funeral pyle
Till his swollen eyes with a Lethargic sleep
Were sealed up, having no more tears to weep.
He understands the cause of Englands joy
And least Ambition should their hopes destroy
He boldly does his mind to Monk express
And shows how he may Britains ills redress.
The Genius Speech.
GReat man by blood, by virtue greater made,
Whose presence Banishes the gloomy shade
O^ Britains night; the fair Aurora too
The Royal Phoebus ushered in by you:
Thy Sword has cut our Chains of slavery
Thy hands the Gordian knots of Tyranny
Untied; thy strenuous Arms unhinged our Gates
To show thy streng^h, the greatest pride abates,
To show what thou could do, that we thereby
Might on thy more than Samson's strength rely:
But what thou did was at another frown,
Thou hung'st them up, that kindness was thy own.
Great Hercules of our I Will at last thou'st slain
That Hydra never more to rise again,
Though often crushed, that Monstrous Tail, (which bit
Her own head off) did resurrection git,
But now she is dead, and never more shall rise,
Tryumps, not tears attend her Obsequies.
And now but one stop more and thy great name
Registered stand shall in the book of Fame
In so great Characters the world may read
Thy marchlesse story when that thou art dead:
The World too little for thy fame shall be
And Princes honor shall thy name and thee.
See then great General, Britains Genius now
Before thee stands, and willing is to owe
A happiness to thee, wherein thou may
Raise honor to thy self; if thou delay'st,
Time and necessity will thee prevent
And spoil the luster of thy great intent.
Now drooping Britain raises up her head,
Inspired by thee she arises from the dead,
Her War-made breaches now are cured again,
And joys and ease succeed her grief and pain,
Her spotless Virgin Chores begin to sing
Jo Paeans in honor to their King*
Fail not her now-bigg hopes but be content
To raise an everlasting Nonument
To thee and thy posterity; that bays
May Crown thy Brows and Ages speak thy praise
Thou see our wants, and what it is we would have
It is a King of Charles's race we crave;
Since all the people in one voice agree,
God's Oracle, it is God that asks it thee,
Who having scourged poor Britain for her sin,
Returns her Baulme to cure her wounds again,
We 'ave tried, and too too long, a Common wealth,
Such as it was, a Bane to Englands Health,
Where fifty Tyrants with one mouth agree,
To eat up Law, Religion, Liberty.
Monsters that Kings and Bishops Lands devour,
Kept by extorted sums the Nation poor;
Philosophers that changed all to gold,
And let go nothing that their gripes could hold;
Yet these were they that needs would styled be
The Keepers of our England's Liberty;
But by thy power great Monk wee'r freed again,
And George most bravely has the Dragon slain.
Ambitious Cromwell put the purple on,
And having slain the Father, robbed the Son
Of right and title, to a royal Crown,
To set himself up, pulled another down,
And what he got by rapine, he made good,
Though by Religion cloak'd, by force and blood,
All what our Heroes once contended for,
With the sad tempest of a civil War
Himself usurped; and gloryed in his pride
To have with peace what was to Kings denied,
But yet you see the Nation scourged, that God
Renews his mercy and has burned his rod,
And Cromwell's name grows odious every where,
Which was obeyed not out of Love, but fear.
Let his example your ambition curb,
Do not our growing happiness disturb,
By mounting of a Throne is none of yours,
For be assured that the sacred powers,
Will blast the first fruits of thy tyranny,
Fraud must preserve what is got by policy
And now our people used to subtleties,
To be deceived by crafts are grown too wise,
So that the fates deny thy Regiment,
And people to obey no more are bent,
Till he arises in the British sphere,
Whom all desire the royal Crown to wear.
Thou see our griefs and know the ways to cure,
Our Maladies, thy Faith we knows too pure
For to be tempted to betray our hopes,
Who doubts thy loyalty to treason opes
Away; no though thou say thou wilt us deceive,
Such is our confidence we will not believe,
Since one so good and great as Monk must be,
The only Man can give us liberty.
Britain in sackcloth has mourned long enough,
It Is time to lay aside the Sword, and Buff,
It Is time to pull those Puny-nobles down,
Who speak against, and yet affect a Crown,
That those by blood and virtue truly great,
May be enstaled in their long-left seat,
These shining in their ermin gallantry,
Beget a reverence due to Majesty,
Now I have done, and you have this to do,
To bring him in for whom the Nation sue,
Great Charles, who more then by seav'n twelve Months tried,
And in afflictions Furnace purified,
Must come forth brighter then tried gold, more bright
Then lustrous Sol after a dark some night;
Whose brighter beams of Love shall raise the slain,
And make our Halcyon days to live again;
England shall bless thy name when this is done,
And style the Phospher to the rising Sun,
To thee shall Britain pay her anuall vows,
Whilst Ducall diadems crown thy Princely brows.
FINIS.
