These and many other sorts of Printed Maps and Copy-Books, are Printed and
sold by John Overton Stationer, at the sign of the White Horse without Newgate
who scorns to sell any thing pitifully done, and he has more then ten times
the choice and stock that R. W. has, though he vapors that he is the oldest
man. It was formerly Mr. Peter Stents shop the Antientest and Chiefest of that
way in England. If any Booksellers or others in the Country desires to have
any of these things to sell, If they send but a line to John Overton dwelling
as above expressed, he will take as exact care to furnish them as if they were
themselves present, and at as cheap Prises.
