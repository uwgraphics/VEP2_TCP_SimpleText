LONDON, Printed in the Year, 1672.

A Short Sermon Preached at a Short Warning, upon a Short Subject, ( viz.
Malt,) etc.
Beloved,
LET me crave your Reverent Attention, for I am come at a Short Warning, to
Preach a Short Sermon upon a Small Subject, to a Thin Congregation:

Beloved,

My Text is Malt, now I cannot divide it into Sentences, because it has none;
nor into Syllables, because (upon the whole Matter) it is but a Monosyllable;
therefore I must (as necessity enforces me) divide it into Letters, which I
find in my Text to be four MALT.

My Beloved, M is Moral, A is Allegorical, L is Literal, and T is Theological.
The Moral is well set forth to teach you Drunkards good Manners; wherefore M my
Masters, A All of you L Listen T to my Text. The Theological is when one thing
is spoken of, and another thing is meant; the thing spoken of is Malt; the
thing meant is the Oil of Malt, Strong Beer, which you Rusticks make M Meat, A
Apparel, L Liberty, and T Treasure. The Literal is according to the Letter M
Much, A Ale, L Little, T Thrift, Much Ale, Little Thrift. The Theological is
according to the Effects that it works, which I find in my Text to be of two
kinds, First in this World. Secondly, in the World to come. In this World, the
Effects which it works are in some M Murder, in others, A Adultery, in some L
Looseness of Life, in others T Treason. The Effects which it works in the World
to come, are, M Misery, A Anguish, L Lamentation, and T Torment.

Wherefore my First Use shall be a Use of Exhortation: M My Masters, A All of
you, L Leave, T Tippling; or else by way of Commination, M My Masters, A All of
you, L Look for, T Torments.

And so much shall suffice for this Time and Text; only by way of Caution take
this

Character of a Drunkard.
THat He is the Annoyance of Modesty, the Trouble of Civility, the Spoil of
Wealth, the Destruction of Reason, the Brewer's Agent, the Ale-house's
Benefactour, the Beggar's Companion, the Constable's Trouble, his Wife's Woe,
his Children's Sorrow, his Neighbor's Scoff, his own Shame, a walking
Swill-Tub, a Picture of a Beast, and a Monster of a Man.

Say-well and Doe-well end both with a Letter,
Say-well is good, but Doe-well is better.

FINIS.
