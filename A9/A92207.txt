AN Evening SACRIFICE OR PRAYER for a FAMILY; Necessary for these calamitous
times.
O Lord God Almighty, protector, and preserver of all thy Creatures, thy glory
covers the Heavens, and the Earth is full of thy praise; than art gracious,
and of great mercy in pardoning those who confess, and forsake their sins; but
dreadful in the execution of thy judgments on all those who hide them, and
obsturately go on in their rebellions against thy sacred Majesty: their
judgment sleeps n^^, and the day hastes on wherein the Heavens shall 2 Pet.

pass away with a noise, the Elements melt with heat, and the Earth with all
the works therein, shall be burnt up, and Christ the Judge of the living and
the dead, shall show himself from Heaven, with millions of Angels in flaming
fire, to render vengeance to the wicked, and to recompense every man according
to his deservings. Remembering the terror of that day, the severity of thy
Justice, how impossible it is to fly from thee, how dreadful to fall into
thine hands when thou art angry; and finding no ground of comfort out of thee,
and thy Christ no way to escape thy Justice, but by flying to thy free grace;
we appeal from thy tribunal of Judgment, unto the sanctuary of thy Mercy, let
open unto us in that only living way thy Son our Savior Jesus Christ, humbly
acknowledging, that so many and so grievous have our sins, and transgressions
continually been, in the contempt of thy Word, careless neglect of our souls
health, impious pursuance of our own vile desires, omission of holy duties,
for the prosecution of our own vain and sinful purposes, as that never durst
we lift up an eye to Heaven, nor could we an heart to Prayer; did not thou
whose mercy pulls us like brands out of the fire, help our infirmities by thy
holy Spirit, endite our Petitions when we know not what Romans 8. Matthew. 11.
Psalm. 50. 15. Zeph. 1. 12.
to pray, as we ought, and invite us to call upon thee by promising to hear and
help us. We know O Lord, that if thou who searchedst Jerusalem with lights, and
punishedst them who settled on their lees, should now examine our lives and
conversations in our customary living, nakedness, and destitution of grace, we
could not but be ashamed and confounded at thy presence, having no excuse for
our vileness, no pretense for our justification left us: Thou have nourished
and brought up children, but we have continually rebelled against thee, and
followed our own unhappy ways; thou have revealed thy will concerning our
salvation, but we have prodigally spent that portion of knowledge, wherewith
thou have not once, but continually furnished us by thy Word preached to beget
faith and obedience in us, and to open unto us the inestimable riches of thy
grace and mercy in Christ Jesus; thou have ever been a tender and gracious
Father unto us, but we have sinned against Heaven and against thee, and are no
more worthy to be called thy sons: we have consulted shame to our families, and
confusion to our own souls, and if we would hide our iniquities, the Hab. 2. 11.
stone should cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber witness
against it: if thou whose allseeing eve of Justice runs to and fro through
the whole Earth, shall be extreme to mark what is done amiss, thou need no
witness, because the evidence of every fact cries unto thee, nor further
examination of the Book of Remembrance, then concerning the sins of this day
sufficient to condemn us, to make our houses desolation, and our souls examples
of thy just judgments on transgressors: we have by our heardnesse of heart,
and secure impenitency stored up to our selves, wrath against the day of thy
fierce wrath, and revelation of thy righteous judgments: O Lord we confess,
that we deserve to be smitten with blasting and mildews in all the labors of
our hands; that the Heavens over us should either pour down drowning floods,
or be stayed from dew, and the Earth from her fruit, and that after this
dreadful execution of thy wrath, by the spirit of division sent amongst us,
and the sword in mutual slaughters, drunken with the native blood of this
Lands Inhabitants, thou should also call for a foreign enemy, or a famine
and pestilence to consume the residue: But O Lord, our wounds are already
dolorous, our afflictions grievous, and our cries doleful from Dan to
Beersheba, from one end of the Land to the other, such as may move an enemy to
pity, such as do make us a wonder and astonishment, not only to those
neighboring Nations (who have lately envyed our happy peace and plenty) but
also to our selves, for as much as this whole destruction is of our selves, who
sufficiently feel the judgment, and yet cannot stay our own wretched hands
from a desperate pursuit and execution thereof upon our selves. Yet when we
consider our many provocations of thy justice by our unthankfulness for all
thy blessings, abase of thy good Creatures, wilful stopping our ears to thy
Prophets, whose messages we have not laid to heart, nor hearkened to them when
they cried to us to turn from our evil ways, our vain confidence in the
counsels of men, and in arm of flesh, we cannot so much wonder at the present
curse which is upon us, and that thou have been sore displeased with us, as
that thou did not long since destroy us, or do not utterly now; seeing we
have not yet profited by thy fatherly corrections, Nehem. 1. 6, 7.
nor turned to the Hand that smites us. But O Lord, who can stand before thine
indignation and endure the fierceness of thine anger? Spare us, good Lord,
miserable Creatures, but the work of thine own hands: who is God like unto
thee, that pardons iniquity, and passes by transgression? Have mercy on us,
wretched sinners, but the people whom thou have redeemed: Lord retain not thine
anger for ever: thou who delightest in mercy, turn again, and have compassion
on us: subdue our iniquities, cast all our sins into the depth of the Sea, that
they may no more appear in judgment against us, to provoke thine anger to our
destruction: perform thy truth, and thy mercy to us: revive thy work, and in
judgment show mercy: thou delightest not in the misery, nor desire the death
of wretched sinners, but that they may be converted and live: O Lord, it is too
much misery to be sinners, let not thy justice press upon the wounds of our
afflicted soul, nor follow us with the bitter fruits of our sins, the guilt
and dreadful punishment due to the same in the final desolation which now
threatens this Land: Lord consider to whom thou have done this; thou have
given us the Seals of thy Covenant, whereby we are called thine: Lord destroy
not the work of thine own mercy; thou reconciledst us when we were enemies;
cast us not away, seeing thou have made us thy Sons: though thou afflict us
with grief, and fill us with bitterness, to make us consider our waves, and to
return unto thee; yet thou have not forgotten to be gracious, nor is thy mercy
come to an end for ever: Therefore have compassion on us: we have rebelled, and
thou have not spared: fear and snare, destruction and desolation are come upon
us: we hope, and attain not, we cry unto thee, but yet, O holy one of Israel,
it appears not that thou hear us: yet we believe (Lord help our unbelief)
and are assured of the truth of thy promise once to hear us: But Lord how long
shall we mourn, and find no comfort in our souls? We know we cannot be
deceived in our confidence, for thou have never failed them that trust in thee:
Lord try us not above that patience which thou will give us, and so thy holy
will be done: Reject us not finally, and so give us patience to expect thy
saving health: Blessed Jesus, who after many sharp repulses, gave a gracious
answer to that importunate Canaanites intercession, now at last answer our
Petitions with comfort: Lord look down from Heaven, and behold how we labor
and have no rest: Where our Prayers want fervency, pour out upon us thy Spirit
of grace and supplications: where our sins hinder thy mercy, in mercy turn us
unto thee, and we shall be turned: where our hardness of heart holds us in
impenitency, take away our stony hearts, and give us hearts of flesh: give us
unfeigned repentance, who will assuredly show mercy to the penitent: renew our
days as of old: thou art our portion, give us not over unto the will of our
destroyers: we resign our selves wholly into thy hands, O Lord our Maker, make
us such as thou would have be, that thou may be pleased to show mercy unto
us in our deliverance: give us rest from our days of trouble, that we may
again rejoice in thee, before we go hence into the silent grave, where none can
praise thee: let the end of all our sufferings be thy glory, and our amendment,
not our destruction.

Neither are we mindful of our selves alone, but we humbly pray thee also for
thy universal Church: Lord bless her with the Spirit of Truth and Unity:
Suppress all those unhappy Schisms, Heresies, and Factions, which any ways,
or any where, distract, or disquiet thy little flock: Lord God of Unity, grant
that all we who profess one truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ may by our
mutual love approve our selves his Disciples; and being united by his good
Spirit, may all hold that unity in the hand of peace, to the glory of thy great
Name, who art the God of peace; to the adorning of the Gospel, which is the
doctrine of peace: to the good example of our Brethren who are the sons of
peace: to the silencing them who are the enemies of peace, and to the endless
peace, and comfort of our souls and consciences, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Bless our Sovereign Lord the King; save and defend Him, that He may defend
the Faith and faithful People: Keep Him from all Treasons and Conspiracies,
confound the Counsels of all mischievous Ahithophels: give Him the Spirit of
Wisdom and Counsel to govern this people in peace and godliness: Bless Him
with abundance of peace, a prosperous Reign, Faithful subjection of His
People, length of days, and eternal happiness in the world to come. Bless
the Queen, and the Royal Issue: Lord so season their tender years, with grace
and truth, that in their riper Age, they may become nursing Fathers, and
nursing Mothers to thy Church: Bless all the Counselors, Judges, and
Ministers of State, with Wisdom, Fidelity, and Equity: be with them in the
Cause, and direct them in the sentence so, as that they may Council prudently,
and Judge equally, ever remembering that themselves must ere long stand before
thy more dreadful tribunal, where there is no respect of Persons: Bless all
the faithful Ministers of thy holy Word and Sacraments, with sincerity of
life, and soundness of doctrine, that they may faithfully and powerfully
dispense thy saving Mysteries, and lead thy People in the strait paths of Life
everlasting: show thy mercy on all the afflicted Servants of Christ Jesus:
apply thy Comforts to them according to their several wants and necessities:
speak peace unto their souls, and assure them of thy saving health, that they
faint not under their burden.

Bless and keep this Family, and all that thou have given us: set thy fear in
every one of our hearts, and make us all thy faithful Servants: preserve us
from all noisome contagion and infection of bodies and souls from all the
snares of sin, Satan, the World, and the Flesh; from the power of the
adversary; from robbers, spoilers, and oppressions, and from all dangers,
spiritual or temporal; forgive us all our neglects, and failings this day
past.

And now that the night and darkness are upon us, wherein thou have appointed
that we shall rest; we humbly pray thee, whose providence, neither sleeps,
nor can be prevented by any sudden evil, to watch over us, and preserve us so,
as that our sleep may be comfortable for the refreshidg our weary bodies, that
our souls resting in thee, we may awake enabled to thy service, and the works
of our callings: Into thy hands, O Lord, we commend, and commit our selves,
bodies, and souls, and all that which thou have given us, and made near and
dear unto us, whether we sleep or wake, live, or die, have us ever in thy
gracious keeping this night, and ever more. Amen.

FINIS.
