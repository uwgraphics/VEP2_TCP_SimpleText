A TRUE DECLARATION OF The bloody Proceedings OF The Men in Maidstone in the
County OF KENT: Who write themselves, John Allen, Mayor, Lambert Godfrey,
Recorder, John Chantler, Constable, against John Stubs, William Caton, who by
the scornful generation of men are called QUAKERS.
AFter nine or ten weeks travel and labor of William Caton, and John Stubs,
into several towns and villages in the County of Kent, we came into Maidstone
upon the 27 day of the third month, being the first day of the week, about the
third hour in the after-part of the day, having bin at a Baptist-meeting the
former part, at a place called Bauton Green, 2 or 3 miles distant from the said
Maidstone, and coming thither as aforesaid, we went to one VVhetstones house,
tho unknown to him or any man outwardly in the town; and continuing there about
half an hour, one of us went to the Steeplehouse, where a people called
Presbyterians meets, and the other went to a place where a people called
Independants were, and when they that were set up to teach amongst them had
done, and all silent, we spoke; but with scorn and contempt I who were at the
Steeplehouse was put forth, but in the Steeplehouse-yard I spoke something to
the people, til that one John Chantler, Constable, came to me in sury, and put
me away, and gave another Constable charge with me, and by him carried to the
Stocks, where I was kept awhile, and then brought me forth, and was had before
one who writes himself Lambert Godfrey, call d a Justice of Peace and Recorder,
and there by him was e^amined what I was, and from whence I came; my education
in my youth, and what vocation I had followed from my youth up unto this
present, and many subtle and needless queries not worth mentioning; but what I
was free in the Lord to answer to, I did notwithstanding his malicious
intentions against me, as afterward appeared; I told him for the most part,
from a child I was kept at the School, until I was seve^teen or eighteen years
of age; and some years after I was banished forth of my own Country, in the
Bishops and Prelates time, for the testimony of a good conscience, because I
could not bow to that image, which was by them set up, and maintained by that
power then in being, and afterward I was a Soldier near from the beginning of
the wars in the Northern parts, and told him when I came off the Soldiery,
and the cause wherefore; then he asked what employment I followed since, and
how I lived: I told him I lived with my wife and children in Bishopric,
nameing the place where, but still he urged upon me again and again to know
what I wrought, and how I lived, and who maintained me, I told him the Lord
maintained me, and in him I lived, moved, and had my being; but that would not
satisfy him, I must tell him what I followed for an outward livelihood, then I
told him, that I had a Tenement of Land, which did afford me a sufficiency in
the outward; then says he, you are a Husbandman, I replied that I was little
brought up with it, but thou may write me what thou will, and he said, he would
set me on work tomorrow, and get me a Master; so he writes a Mittimus, and
sends me to prison to a place in the town called the Brambles, and the next day
I was called before him the said Godfrey, and John Allen, Mayor, and there
examined again, part of which I have already related, in his former
examination, which he again quired; in the second examination they demanded
further, the month and year I came off the wars, and many other foolish and
needless questions, which were tedious to relate; and he asked me the time
when I came from my outward being, and when I came to London, and my
continuance and employment there; I told him my employment and work was there
to wait upon the Lord, to write and speak as I was moved of the Lord, against
the deceit of Priests and People; then they examined about our coming into
Kent, the time when we came from London, the way we came, the places we came
to, the continuance in every place; all which was told them accordingly; and
what we did in D^ver and the Towns and Villages thereabouts, and how we were
employed; I told him we were employed in the work of the Lord, in declaring as
we were moved, against the unjust dealings of men, false ways and worships, and
when I would have spoken further, they interrupted me; I told him, if thou do
write, take all my words, and not some few only what thou will, and as thou will, but take my words as I speak them; so scoffingly he said, they are pure
words, they must not want setting down, then they dimissed me from their
Court, and sent me to hold again, and shortly after sent for me, and told me
they had provided a Master for me; and they brought forth a Statute, and told
me my wages was four pounds a year, and meat and drink; I answered, Will thou
compel me to serve this man against my w^ll? Here thou will exercise the
office of a Tyrant, produce one Sentence and clause of Law which I have broken,
if I have let me suffer accordingly, and make it appear before this people
wherein I have transgressed, or wherein thou have power to make me a Slave in
thy will co become another man's servant, and to limit me wages and time, what
Law have thou for this? O man fear the Lord, and plead the cause of innocent,
and know that one day thou shall find God will judge thee, and that justly;
and therefore beware what thou do, see that thou act not against me in thy
own will, one sentence and clause of Law bring forth against me, let not thy
will be a Law, I am no Child that thou needs to tender any such thing to me
as a Master, I deny it, and I spoke to him that they called my Master; Friend,
thou will get no service of me against my will, yet idleness I deny in my self,
and declares against it in others, in my calling and work I am, and he that
called me and sets me on work is the Lord, which you know not, then they
sent me to prison again; all this while my deer fellow laborer, and fellow
sufferer was absent from me, being not then had to prison by those people
called Independants, but was at liberty is his Lodging, where he was all night
at an Inn in the Town; but soon after they had done with me, they sent for
him, the manner of his Examination is as follows.

I. VV. C. being at an Inn at the sign of the Bell in Maidstone, (there
waiting for an opportunity to speak with my dear Brother) was sent for by the
Magistrate, and being brought before him, was by him examined where I dwelt,
and how long it was since I came from my outward being, and which way, and many
more frivolous questions which is not worth mentioning; unto some I answered,
as that I came by London, and he asked me what I did there while I continued in
the City? I told him, in making known the everlasting truth, as I was moved of
the Lord, in whose work and service I was employed: Furthermore, he quired of
me concerning my employment since I came into this County, what it was, if it
were the same that I followed at London? I told him, Yea: my labor and work
was to turn people from the darkness to the light, that with the light they
might see themselves and their ways, and with it be brought to repentance from
under the power of darkness: so then he said, he had now gotten a Master for
me, and that I might now be set on work, and be bound unto him for so much a
year; which I refused to be bound to any man, or to be in bondage to any, for
I told him, that I was called into the work of the Lord, whose Truth as it was
made manifest in me, I freely declared, for the testimony of which I saw then a
calling to suffer to bear witness to it, and not when the time of trial came
to fall away; after that the children of Israel were brought forth of Egypt by
the mighty power of the Lord, they were no longer under Pharaoh, to bow to him;
neither could I, being formerly servant to man, and made free by the power of
the Lord, could not go out of my calling into which I was called by the Lord
into his Vineyard to leave that work, and so to turn from the Lord out of my
own freedom to be a slave to man; whereupon their wills being crossed, and
they seeing that to them I could not bow nor yield, but in the power of the
LORD I was kept, in which power I was made willing to suffer for the testimony
of his EVERLASTING TRUTH, which shall testify against them his ENEMIES, who
could not charge me with the breach of any LAW, neither was there any to accuse
me, their rage and cruelty was so much toward the appearance of Truth in me,
that from them my reward was correction at Bridewel.

When they had thus examined us severally, they put us together, where I the
said I. S. had been all night, and shortly after the Jailer came and told us we
had our liberty for paying our Fees, we told him we could pay none, he said we
must be paid, so he took us forth, and the said Chauntler and another Constable
took us away by Warrant with their black Staves of power, to conduct us to
another prison, called the Bridewell, coming thither we were committed into
the hands of the keeper of the said place, and many people, men and women did
accompany us, few or no friends we knew amongst them, only they came to see
what was to be done to us in that place, the Magistrates nor none of the
Officers told us what fact we had done, what Law we had broken, though we
desired them to instance one Sentence or one Clause, neither did we hear the
Mittimus, neither did any man accuse us, nor lay any thing to our charge, but
thus we were carried as aforesaid, to that place where the man took us into
custody, and then searched us narrowly, and took our money, our Bibles,
Gloves, Ink-horns, Knives, Papers, and such things as we had in our Pockets
from us, and then had into a Room where we were stripped naked, and our Legs
and Arms put in the Stocks, and there whipped with Cords in the sight of many,
which forced tears from our adversaries, and they that were to see execution
done, desired him several times to hold his hand before he did, but he was as
partial in executing his office as the Recorder, and the Mayor was unjust in
their bloody proceedings against us, without any just color of Law, for he
gave my dearer fellow VV. C. more Stripes than I got, though by their own
Sentence a lesser offender.

When they had thus done they fastened Irons upon us with great Clogs of Wood,
and put us in amongst other two, which were committed and were working, so
after we had been in a little while, being about the second hour of the second
day of the week, the Executioner commanded us to work, and set forth work for
us, but we standing out of his will and the will of man, could not answer his
order, nevertheless he labored much that afternoon and the next day, both by
threatenings and fair speeches to bring us in subjection to his will, and to
the order of the place, as he said, which was, that all that came thither
might work, or else not eat, so we seeing their tyranny and oppression, could
not be subject to their wills, but was made willing to undergo what they had
power to infflict upon us, which we saw to be a trial for us, and that it
would but continue but a season, though that then their threatenings and cruelty
were exceeding great, for they would not let us have any thing for our money
only a little water once a day we had, by the persuasion of some soldiers,
and some others; so he continued with us the second and third day, sometimes by
fair speeches and sometimes by threatenings, to work if it were never so little,
and we should want nothing, if not, we might not expect to eat, then the fourth
day of the week, about the eleventh hour, the said John Chauntler brought a
discharge, with two several Warrants to convey us from Officer to Officer, to
our own Country, and when he came to bring us our books and other things
which they had taken from us, he the said Chauntler kept our papers and
letters, which was given forth and sent to us from several friends and did not
give us them again, but brunt them before our eyes which were precious papers,
which tended to the destruction of sin: To the advancement of Holiness: That
Satan's Kingdom might be defaced, and the Kingdom of Christ renewed, that
people might be brought from Darkness to Light, from under the Dominion of
Satan unto God: From under the teachings of men unto God, the Teacher of his
people: From under the teachings of Hirelings which Jeremy cried against: And
from the teaching of Dumb-Dogs, and Greedy Dogs, which can never have enough:
And from such as eat the fat and Cloth with the Wool, and makes a prey upon
the people, which Isajah, and Ezekiel testified against: And from such as cries
peace, peace to such whom the Lord has not spoken peace to, which persecutors
of the innocent holds up, in which state you are, Godfrey Allen, and Chauntler,
persecuting them who with the same Light, as the Prophets of the Lord saw them
then withal, does see them now who you uphold, to be in the same steps that
they were in, whom the Prophets of the Lord testified against, and therefore do
we, as we are moved of the Lord, declare against them now, and lays open their
deceits in writing now, so the same portion do we receive of you, as the
Prophets of the Lord did of them, who upheld such then; Oh horrible! how can
you call your selves Christians, and such heathenish practices seen amongst
you, you exceed the tyranny of the Bishops and Prelates, and Justices, and
Mayors, and Recorders which were in power then, so as you exceed your fathers
in cruelty and violence toward the innocent, if your punishment exceed theirs,
say not God is unjust, when it comes you may remember you have been warned by
one who have felt and born the Bishops and Prelates rigor over the Conscience
by them then, suffered the loss of Liberty, Friends, Means, and all outward,
dear and near Relations whatsoever, not only so, but traveled many years in
the Parliaments Army, through much Scarcity, Watchfulness, Dangers, Perils,
many cold Stormy Nights and Days; for several Years past over my Head, much
precious time spent, WIFE and small CHILDREN forsaken, and LIFE Engaged many
times in the WAR, yet in the midst of the greatest straits and extremities
still hoping a DAY of FREEDOM would come, and now to be thus rewarded by this
POWER which is now in being, for which I have been made willing for many
YEARS by past, to sustain the loss of all to do him good to my utmost against
HIS and the NATIONS ENEMIES, and now to be thus served a poor REQUITAL, what
EVIL have I done, let that in the CONSCIENCE speak.

Lambert Godfrey, Recorder; John Allen, Major, John Chauntler, you are recorded
to be persecutors of the Just, and worse then your forefathers (who bare rule
in the Kings days) that persecuted the Innocent without cause: In your Precept
(as you call it) you charge us to be wandering, idle, and disorderly persons,
idleness and disorder we do deny; and because our work and travel is to turn
people from their false ways, false worships, heathenish Customs, from the
Power of Darkness, and all unrighteousness, and does direct people unto the
Light, which does discover unto them their works of Darkness, and lets them see
their disorder and confusion, and lets them see the wickedness which all the
world lies in, that so with this they may be turned from the evil of their
doings, toward Christ Jesus from whence it comes, who is the way to the
Father: and when the Lord moves us to go to declare against his Enemies, such
as he cried woe against, whether it be in Towns, Cities, or Villages, because
we are obedient unto his command, which is contrary to man's will so your wills
being crossed, you invented these three terms against us, upon which you
grounded your cruelty, in saying we were idle, wandering, and disorderly
persons, because we declare against the hirelings and false Shepherds of
England, of which number you three are recorded to be Enemies to Christ, and
upholders of Antichrist, but know assuredly, that the just judgments of our
God will you pursue, and them you cannot escape, for that in all your
Consciences shall (for the living God and us) bear witness, but against you
eternally when the day of account comes, you shall witness what we speak to be
true.

And whereas we were seized upon and apprehended, the one at an Inn, the other
at the Steeplehouse, neither of us had any Law transgressed; wherein it does
plain-appear, that it was only your wills that were crossed, and so exercised
your cruelty upon us; he that were at the Steeplehouse after that all was
ended, speaking a few words to the Priest which you called a disturbance; now
let the Children of Light judge, whether this were disturbance or disorder, but
order in the Church of Christ, which makes it clearly manifest that yours is no
Church of Christ, but an Idolls-Temple, for in Christ's Church if any thing be
revealed to him that sits by, the first is to hold his peace; now your Priest
had finished his glass, and said his Prayer, and his blessing before I spoke,
and after I had spoken a few words, they said, take him away, which was done
accordingly.

Therefore let all people judge (whose understandings are opened) betwixt us
two that were imprisoned and whipped at Maidstone, and the Priests and Teachers
of this Nation, who are the most idle, wandering, and walks disorderly, whether
they who are out of the practice, and out of the life of the Prophets, Christ,
and the Apostles, who wanders and turns from the Light in their Conscience,
which brings the children of Light from the wandering state to be stayed upon
the Lord, out of negligence and idleness into diligence, and to labor in the
work of the Lord, and in his Vinyard, that all sloathfull servants may be bound
hand and foot and cast into utter darkness, for cursed is he that does the work
of the Lord negligently; therefore be awarned all ye Hirelings every where in
the Nation, the woe lies near you, those three crimes which we are charged
withal, take them to your selves, persecutors, Priest, and people, wanderers,
idle, and disorderly you are, who walks contrary to the Light in your
consciences, which comes from him who is a God of order, so acting contrary to
this you wander from the pure commands of the Lord, and neglect his work, which
is to labor in his Vinyard, why stand ye idle, yet making your selves a cloak
to cover your filthiness withal? taking the Prophets words, Christ and the
Apostles words, and Preaches them for hire, which were spoken forth freely,
here you are thieves, and we charge it upon you, for stealing the Saints words,
and selling them to people for so much a year, but they that spoke these words
which you make a trade of, they were such as came through great tribulation,
they followed the Lamb whithersoever he went; there was no guile found in their
mouths, the Epistles were written to the Saints, for the perfecting of the Man
of God, for Holy Men spoke them forth as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,
they were not written for proud men to trade withal but they test^fie against
pride and all manner of filthiness, which are now practiced among Priests, and
People, and Professors in this Nation, who have gotten the Saints words, which
was redeemed from their vain conversation, but cannot agree about the meaning
thereof, they are in such confusion among themselves, that one cannot
understand another Language though all English men: therefore, O England,
England, it is time for thy towers to fall, when thy builders are thus
confounded among themselves, the pride of Priests and Teaches, and people in
thee, is come into remembrance before the Lord, and thou cannot escape.

Therefore all Magistrates and other Officers, who do this read, take warning
and beware upon whom you lay your Law, for if you make your wills your Law, and
exersise your cruelty and tyranny upon the innocent; then that which is
according to the Law of God in all your consciences will you condemn, and
better it had been for you, that you never had been born, than to have
persecuted and abused the Servants of the most high God; whose eternal power
is made manifest in them, by which power he does them preserve and keep in the
time of trial: Therefore to that in all your Consciences do we speak, that
with the Light in you the unjust may come to judgment; and so you may learn to
judge according to that, and that will bring you to lay the Law in its place
upon the transgressors, for the which end it was added because of
transgression, and here them that do well will be praised and encouraged by
you, and the evil doers terrified, and this will be acceptable with God, and
such a power we honor in our souls, and are subject to for Conscience sake, so
we have cleared our Consciences to you persecutors at Maidstone, in laying open
your cruelty against us without cause, that herein you may see the evil of
your doings and be ashamed, and so come to repentance, that for the time to
come you may be awarned, how you exercise your cruelty upon the innocent, to
that which is just in you all we speak, which is your condemnation for your
unjust proceedings.

John Stubs, William Caton.


CAIN was the Vagabond and the fugitive who had no habitation in God, but woe
from God proceeded against him, for said God to him, if thou do well shall thou
not be accepted, if not, sin lies at thy door, and he did not well, and he was
wrath, and his countenance fell, and he was a persecutor of him that was in the
faith, and a Murderer: and you be the Vagabonds and the Fugitives who persecute
them that be in the faith, though you may Sacrifice as Cain did, your Sacrifice
God does not accept, but woe from God does proceed against you that are in Cains
way persecutors, envyers, and Murderers, full of wrath, whose countenance
falls, as your fruits has made appear, and the Vagabond fellows would have
murdered Paul, and the wandering Stars spoken of in Jude went in Cains way,
which is Envy, Murder, and Persecution, which Abel is not which was in the
faith, and the faith is one; the Apostles which were in the faith, they saw the
Vagabond fellows, they saw the wandering Stars which went in Cains way, and
Balaams way, from the Spirit of God, with which Spirit we see such who are born
not of the Spirit, but of the flesh, persecuting them who are not of the flesh,
but of the Spirit, whose Sacrifice God accepts.

The Son of Man was no Vagabond, he had no place to lay his head; and the
Apostles were no Vagabonds, who had no certain dwell^ng place, and such who are
spoken of in the Hebrews, who were in the Faith, which were imprisoned, and in
Bonds, with scourgings, and tempted, and afflicted, and tormented, and
destitute, but these were so at the Town called Maidstone, through the Faith
obtained a good report, who are such as the world is not worthy, looking unto
Jesus who is the author and finisher of their Faith, running their race with
patience, enduring the cross, and despising the shame, and knowing and seeing
Jesus, him that endured such speakings against of sinners, in him we have faith
from whom we have received it, which gives us victory over the world, which
brings to inherit the promise.

And you at Maidstone, who have showed your unworthiness in not receiving the
Servants of the Lord, but by cruelty and persecution, shaming your Religion,
Teachers and Church: Now the folly of it is manifest, to that in all your
Consciences I speak, the Light which comes from Christ Jesus, who says, I am
the Light of the world, and lights every man that comes into the world,
there is your teacher to let you see what you have done, there is your
condemnation, for this is the condemnation, the Light says Christ, and
remember in the day of your calamity and condemnation, that in your life time
you were warned, and that the messengers of God were amongst you.
