The Sense of the HOUSE, or the Opinion of some LORDS and COMMONS.
Concerning the LONDONERS Petition for PEACE.
GIve ear, beloved Londoners,
Fie, fie, you shame us all.
Your Rising up for Peace will make
The close Committee fall:
I Wonder you should ask for that,
which they, must needs, deny,
Here Is 30. swears the'le have no Peace,
And bid me tell you why.
First I Will noe Peace, says Essex,
For my Chaplin says it is sin,
To Loose 100. l. a day,
Just when my wife lies inn:
They cry, God Bless your Excellence,
But if I loose my Place,
The'le call me Rebel Popular*Asse,
And Cuckold to my Face.
Ye Citizen fools, said Warwick,
Do ye talk to me of Peace,
Who not only stole His Majesty's Ships,
But Robbed him of his Seas;
No, no, I Will keep the water still
And have my Ships well manned,
For I have Leasd and sold so much,
I know not where to Land.
Do, Brother do, says Holland then,
For Peace breeds us noe quiet,
Besides my Places both are lost,
With 16. dishes Diet;
I played the Judas with the King,
which makes the World detest me?
Nay should His Majesty pardon me,
A hundred would Arrest me.
Kimbolton Says those Londoners
Deserve to loose their ears,
For now they will all Obey the King,
Like Citizen Cavaliers:
Lets Vote the Peace a dangerous Plot,
And send them a denial,
For if they save the Kingdom, then,
they will give us a Legal trial.
The Welsh-men rage, quoth Stamford,
And call me villainous Goat
For I plunderd Hereford Aldermens Gowns,
To make my Besse a Coat,
It Is true, the Town did feed me well,
From which I took good Fleeces,
But if Peace come they will rear both me,
And all my whores in pieces.
Fight, fight, quoth Say, now, now hold up,
Their Iealosies and fears;
The work will thrive, I Plotted it,
Above these Seventeene years,
It Is I that am your Engenere,
But if for Peace you Vote,
Oh then they will make me come to church,
Or else will cut my throat.
My father Goodwin, quoth Wharton,
Calls me asilly lad
And wonders you will ask Peace of me,
Who have been lately mad,
Ye chose me I^sh General,
And I chose to stay here,
For should I Fight amongst the b^gs,
their's nere a Sawpi^ there,
These heathen Prentices, quoth Brook,
Did make my Coach man stay*
Bid me be bare, although I spoke,
But 13. Bulls that day,
If Peace knock of my Learned Scull,
Then at my House you will see,
The swoard of Guy, the dunn Cow^ Rib,
The Asses tooth, and me.
I made the Speech quoth Roberts,
When his Excellence first began,
For which he swore by a potle of sack,
To make me a Gentleman.
But if the King get to VVhithall,
Then all my Hopes are past,
I am the first Lord of my house,
And would not be the the last.
COMMONS,
Keep Silence quoth the Speaker,
But do not hold your Peace,
Let Us fit and Vote and hold them to it,
For I Will do what you please:
I'have but poor 6000* pounds,
besides some spoones and bowls,
Nay grant a Peace, and how shall I,
Be Master of the Roles.
Then spoke five members all at once,
And for an Army cried,
Last year say they, they rescued us,
Or else we had been tried.
What though you are almost undone,
Ye shall Contribute still
We will convey our Truncks away,
And then do what you will.
My venum swells, quoth Hollis,
And that his Majesty knows,
And I quoth Hambden fe^^h the Scots,
When^ all this mischeife grows.
I am an Ass quoth Haslerig,
But yet I Am deep in the plot,
And I quoth Stroud can ly, as fast,
As master Pym can trott.
But I quoth Pym your hackney am,
And all your drudgery do,
Have made good Speeches for my self,
And privileges for you:
I sit and can look down on men,
Whilst others bleed and fight;
I eat their Lordships meat by day,
And give it their Wives by night.
Then Vane grew black 'ith Face, and swears,
Their's none so deep as I,
The Staff and Signet slipped my hand,
My Son can tell you why.
The name of Peace men say is sweet,
But oh it makes me stink,
For Straffords Ghost does haunt me so,
I cannot sleep a wink.
Were Starfford living Mildmay said,
He would do me none ill;
For I bid my self in the privy,
When 'th house did pass his Bill:
But oh my gold and silver thread,
That Gregory calls his own;
Though in a Ship I made my will,
I was not borne to drown.
You found me, quoth Sir Robert Pie,
I have bin long a knave;
And promise I should be so still,
So you my Vote should have.
And I* (quoth Lawrence Whitaker,)
Agree to do so too;
And if you leave old Courtiers thus,
They Will do as much for you.
This Peace (quoth Michaell Olsworth,
Will bring no fee to me;
And yet my Lord has sworn for it,
And will not follow me.
Fie, down with Bishops Wheeler said,
For I have Robbed the Church;
Oh base, will you conclude of Peace,
And leave us in the lurch,
Who talks of Peace, quoth Ludlow?
Has neither Sense, nor Reason;
For I never spoke in the house but once,
And then I spoke high Treason:
Your meaning was as bad as mine,
You must defend my Speech;
Or else you will make my Mouth as famed,
As was my Fathers breetch.
I Will Plunder him, (quoth Bainton)
That mentions Peace to me;
The last Bishop would not grant my Lease,
But now I have it free.
A Gunpowder Monopoly,
Quoth Eveling, raised my Father;
And if you let the Peace go on,
They Will call me Powder Traitor.
Foh, said Sir John Hotham,
Is this a time to Treat,
When New Castle, and Cumberland,
Me to the Walls have bear:
Ye base obedient Citizens,
Do ye think to save your Lives;
My Son and I will serve you all,
As I have served five Wives.
Indeed, quoth Sir Hugh Cholmely,
Sir John, you say most true;
For I have Sold and Morgaged,
Even all my Land to you.
My Brother would have served the KING,
But was forbidd to stay;
The King foresaw at Keinton Field,
Sir Harry would run a way.
I went down, (quoth Sir Stapleton)
With Musket, Pike, and Drum;
To fetch Sir Francis Wortley up,
But truly, he will not come.
Oh Lord, Sir Robert Harlowe said,
How do our foes increase;
I wonder who the Devil it was,
That first invented Peace!
Treason, treason, treason,
Sir Walter Earl cried out;
Far worse then blowing up the Thames,
The Dagger, or the Clout.
Damm it, said Miles Corbet,
Or we are all confounded;
And Cavaliers will Cuckold me,
As well as did the Round head.
Zounds said Henry Martin,
We Will have no Accommodation;
Do You not know, 'twas I that tore,
His Majesty's Proclamation.
In the House I spoke high treason,
I Have sold both Land and Lease;
Nay, I shall then have but three Whores,
A pox upon this Peace.
Ye^ see, (beloved Londoners*)
Your Peace is out of season;
For which you have the sense of'th House,
And every Members Reason.
Oh do not stand for Peace then,
For trust me if you do;
Each County of the Kingdom will,
Rise up, and do so too.
FINIS.
OXFORD.
