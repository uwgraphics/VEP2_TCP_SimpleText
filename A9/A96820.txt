A Plain, and Good ADVICE to the Parliament Men, and Officers of the Army, Of
the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland.
Given forth in the Name, and Authority, and by the Command of the Lord of
Host, for them to Read, and consider in the (...) of the Day.
O YE PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND! by whom I most Unjustly suffer, because it is in
your Hands, but not in your Hearts to this very day to let the Oppressed go
free: And though the Lord God has (by putting this power into your Hands)
tried you once more, to see whether ye would do as ye have often said; and
perform the Vows which ye have uttered before the Almighty God and good Men,
when ye were in trouble. But alas! in this case ye have not dealt faithfully,
but like Ephraim, ye have turned back in the Lords Battle, and turned aside
like a deceitful Bow: Therefore is the Lord arising in his Jealousy, and in
his Anger against you, as he has done against yours, and his Enemies. And will
the Lord disown one Persecuting Government, and save another which are walking
in their steps? Nay, he will not. And though he has wonderfully been with you,
and in your Lo condition has he many a time remembered you, and saved you out
of their hands that have been too strong for you: And if ever Israel had cause
to say, (You much more) Had not the Lord been on our side, We, and our little
Ones should have been a Prey, and utterly perished by our Enemies. Moreover,
the Lord has saved you; and ye are not only a People saved by the Lord from
outward Enemies; and your Lives, and the lives of your Wives, and your little
Ones given you for a prey; but he has given you also the Necks of your
Enemies, and those that hated you, come Bending before you; and he has given
you goodly Houses which ye did not build, and Fields for which ye did not
labor; not because ye were better than others, but because ye should be a
shelter to his People, and let his Outcast dwell with you: But thus says the
Lord, the Lord God Almighty, Ye also have wasted my heritage: and instead of
breaking the Jaws of the Wicked, and delivering the Island of the Innocent, and
saving the afflicted; and delivering them that were appointed for Destruction
instead hereof, says the Lord Almighty: Ye are setting up them that are
smiting at you, and such as God would have had you to have thrown down, rather
than strengthen them by your oppressing Laws which are yet by you maintained,
and not thrown down. And though ye have done well in delivering some out of
Prison, that for Conscience toward God, could not maintain a false and
deceitful Ministry; yet ye have not (like Caleb, and Joshua) gone through with
the work; but ye (like Israel of old) have been afraid of the People whom the
Shield, and strength of the Lord is departed: And ye have not in this thing
done wisely, but very foolishly, and your hearts have not been upright; neither
have ye wholly followed the Lord God of Israel; and many Popish Laws are yet in
force, and not Repealed by you; by which Laws, them whom ye have set at
liberty, may by their persecutors suffer again when they please. And so
Friends, this is not to do the Lords work faithfully, but deceitfully; so We
(by You) are not preserved in the liberty of a pure Conscience, but rather
reserved for a day of Destruction at our Enemies pleasures. And what have we
done? or wherein have we been Treacherous against this, or any Government? but
that we, who have been, of all people of this Nation Faithful, and have done
you good, (that of God in you shall bear us witness) for this your Evil dealing
toward us, that we, of all men, can have little Justice from you: And this ye
have done against the Lord, and against his People: and after all Gods goodness
to you, (in Hypocrisy) ye Proclaimed a day of Feasting, and Thanksgiving, and
there you hearkened to one of your Teachers, that falsely accused the Lords
People to you, and cries to the Magistrate, as the old Persecutors did in the
days of the Apostles, Help men of Israel, these men turn the world upside down.
And so your Feasting is not much better than Ahabs Fasting: for ye suffered
three of us (at your THANKSGIVING-SERMON) to be Beaten, only for speaking a few
words, in the Name and Authority of the Lord; and two of us lie in Newgate now,
and ye were Eyewitnesses of this thing; who of all others should not suffer
such things to be; yet ye suffered us to be beaten before your Eyes, and none
of you so Valiant for the Lord, as to stand up, and desire to understand this
thing: but after we were beaten (contrary to all Law) we were violently carried
to Newgate, and not so much as Queen Mary's Law broken by me; by which Law so
many of us have lost both our lives and liberties, being Imprisoned till Death:
as if this were not enough, but your Teachers are still stirring you up to turn
the Sword against the Innocent.

And will ye call this a Day of Thanksgiving, or a day Acceptable to the Lord?
Nay, nay, God will find you out; and as for Us, we are in Gods hand; and if he
command us to cry in the Kings Chapel, or against the Heads and Mountains of
Israel, we love not our lives to the Death: and whether we ought to obey God or
Man, judge ye, with the spirit of the Lord in your Consciences? And though we
are rejected, and our necks under Bondage; and our lives, liberties, and goods
Spoiled by you, it being in your power to break in pieces all Persecution: Yet
know, the Lord is Our strength, and Our shield; and the Voice of a King is
amongst Us, though ye have with Feasting, and Fullness, shut both your hearts
and ears against him, and we know the Rock of Ages: and though our lives (by
you) may be made bitter to us, yet against the tried Stone shall ye never
prevail; and though ye are building your own Houses, and Honoring one another,
and rejecting him that receives not honor of Men, yet the Lord will honor
him, when all your honor lies in the dust: for the Lord will yet overturn,
overturn, until he Reign, whose right it is to Reign: for Righteousness (of a
truth) does not yet reign among you; neither is the Name of the Lord exalted in
England to this very day, after all your large Engagements for a
GOSPEL-REFORMATION.

And who that fears the Lord can be silent, to see what grievous Oppression,
and wicked Tyranny is found in your Prisons; for within this three weeks, there
is three poor debtors in Newgate perished for want of Bread; while you, after
all your Vows and Promises to ease Oppression, are consuming many hundreds in
Feasting: And in this Prison, where men are cast, pretending that they shall
pay their Debts; which thing ought to be done, but the Lord has a Controversy
with you: for these things are done, and ye suffer them, which ought not to be
suffered among you, who have before the Lord Engaged to take off all
Oppression, which was in your Power.

They are most grievously oppressed, being constrained to pay ten shillings and
six pence a week for a poor bed; so that the By-fees, and such things are
utterly ruined, and made altogether unable either to pay depts, or to redeem
themselves out of perpetual slavery, and this is suffered by you, in whose
days we had cause given us, by your large promises to hope that true Judgment,
and Justices should have streamed down our streets: Therefore Friends, before
it be too late, consider whether this is to perform that which your mouths
have uttered when ye were in trouble and distress: But if you do not thoroughly
amend your ways, and your doings, the Lord will not long suffer you, who will
not suffer the Lamb to rule amongst you; yet the Lord stands in the
Congregation of the Mighty, yea, he judges amongst the Gods.

Therefore, thus says the Lord God, to you that rule this oppressed people,
break all oppressing Laws, and fears not the faces of man, But let my Son come
out of Spiritual Egypt, and let him rule in your hearts, and let every Soul in
AUTHORITY be subject to the Higher Power, and so in Christ: Gods Power, and
Gods Wisdom, ye shall rule and prevail as Princes with God and men, and so
when Christ the King of Righteousness raines in you, he shall scatter the
wicked, and as chaff shall they be before you, and your memorial shall not
rott, but your names shall be had in everlasting remembrance; and you shall be
as ointment poured out, and the Lord shall command his Strength for you, and
your hearts shall be as the heart of a Lion; and the everlasting God shall be
your refuge, and you shall be strengthened by the Arm of the Mighty God of
Jacob.

But friends, this is the plain truth to you all, that so long as the spirit in
you is grieved, ye will grieve it in others; and so long as he is oppressed in
you, ye will oppress his heritage, and make the heart of the righteous sad:
Therefore ye must all come to the measure of his Spirit, which he has given
every one of you to profit withal, and ye shall with it see, and truly
discern, how many Popish unprofitable, and wicked Laws are yet in force: and
how do ye grant liberty, when we and our goods are spoiled to repair an
Idol-Temple, and maintain a false Ministry which God never sent, but were made
at Oxford and Cambridge in the wills of men? therefore, how long shall the Lord
warn you, that ye do not compel us to drink any longer of the Whors Cup, Rev.
17. which has made all Nations, Multitudes, and all the Kings of the earth
Drunk with the wine of her Fornication.

To you this is the word of the Lord, Hate the Whore, the Beast, and the false
Prophet, and lay her desolate; and give not your strength to them any longer,
for if ye go on thus, to turn the Sword against his people, your strength
which he has commanded for you he will Speedily take away, and ye shall be
weak as water; ye your mighty men shall be as women, and fear in your hearts
shall surprise you, and God shall confound you, as he has done the persecutors
that went before you; and all your wisdom and strength shall be to destroy one
another, and you that have been warned so often by the Lord in his people: but
like Pharoh to this day have not broken the bands of oppression,
notwithstanding all Gods goodness to you, and your promises of reformation to
him: O friends! with my soul I desire you do not forget him days without
number, that has in your lo condition so often remembered you: there is a
witness in you, that the Lord stood by you; ye Commanders of the Army, remember
who stood by you in Scotland, and many a time in England has the Lord raised
up his power in you, and your Souls have trodden down strength; and a secret
hand, and inward confidence ye have felt, and deliverance has come ye knew not
how your selves. Thus the Lord has been a Father to you when ye were
fatherless, and comfortless, yea, when almost all the Priests in England and
Scotland were preaching you down, and as one man joining together against you,
these flatterers are now fed by you with the bread of others that did never
thus act; and like Baals Prophets which did eat at Jesabells Table, they are
crying persecute, and prosper.

Therefore, in the Name, and Athority of the Lord God of Host, this is a charge
to you all, let Jesabells Priests eat at Jesabells Table; or, who will set meat
before them, but do not force, impison, and compel my people to maintain them
any longer, as ye have long done, but let them be left free in their spirits,
and consciences, to maintain whom they in their hearts do believe it is their
Duty.

And again, in the name and fear of the Lord I lay it upon you, that ye break
all wicked Laws, and customs in your prisons, and let no more perish for want
of bread, or not paying of fees when they have nothing to pay. And when I
consider how many of the Lords Servants have been moved of the Lord to write to
you, to warn you of these things, and of all the persecution that has been,
and still is in England, and all parts of your dominions, yea, this very day of
your Thanksgiving, how violently we were abused before your eyes, and none
stood up amongst you in the Lords behalf, to say so much as Pilate did, What
evil has these men done? and though we were moved of the Lord, and came in his
name and Authority to speak, yet ye suffer us to be beaten, and carried to
Newgate before your eyes; and few so moderate as to hearken, but cry, away with
them after, I had spoken a few words; and so condemned me, being Innocent in
the sight of God, and good men: I say, considering this, I was unwilling to
write, nevertheless, I being moved of the Lord to write, I am obedient; and I
told you Magistrates then, that unless ye would quiet the people which pulled
me down while I was speaking, I could not be clear of you in the sight of the
Lord.

H. Wollrich
From Newgate, the 6 day of the 8 Month.
