The Welch-mans public Recantation, or his hearty sorrow for taking up of
Arms against her Parliament.
MAy it please all and every one that shall cast her good and favorable eyes
upon this sheets of papers, to know and believe that all her Countrymen of
Wales by whatsoever appellations they be called are wonderfully sorry for her
late temerities and rashness, whereunto the Devil owing her a spite led her
blindfold, for her do with tears overflowing her cheeks, and drowning her
hearts inward and outward acknowledge and confess, (which her will not do at a
Sessions, for fear of hanging) that her was very strangly deceived by
politic jeeres, flaterries, and temtations, to make walks and preambulations
out of her Countries of Wales, to kill and fight with her know not whom, and
her have cursed her self many days together in Welsh for being such simple
puppyes, to be carried away by witchcrafts as her thinks, and as it will
appear in her lamentable and pitiful recantations, which her do now intend
to make, out of the goodness of her British blood, and valiant disposition a
great while ago, her was persuaded to put on her arms, and to march with
great courage and magnanimesties upon great business, and matters of high and
generous consequences as her conceived to conduct and bring her good and
gracious King to her Parliament, and that his person might be secured from all
indignities and injuries, for which her will spend her best blood in her
bellies, her being true Britain and love her King, and prince with all
integrities, and all her hearts, but after her had consented to go in warlike
fashions, her was led away in a fools paradizes, to fall by the swords of her
enemies, and to make her appearances in Kenton Battles, where there was
nothing but killing and slaying of all persons, without respect of degrees and
petidegrees, and ancient Gentlemen and Lords were in as much pericles and
dangers as her poorest Countrymen; Lord bless us, Guns went off like a
clutter of hail stumbling down from her old Regiments in Wales, when her
cosen Boreas swagges and domineers on her Mountains, and was great deluges
and overflowings of blood which was spilt, to make the ground blush for
inhumanities and merciless cruelty, and bullets flew about her ears as
commonly as if her should have told her some tale and bid her beware, but her
could not take heed of her coming, but those round pellots hit her in
invisible miraculous manners her know not how, but her Countrymen was killed
and slain and died like rotten Muttons, before her could make her Inventories
and Wills to all her loving Cosens, her was struck dead without giving her
leave to send commendations of her self and her valor to her Countrymen: and
Saint Winifreds Well could not flow in greater big streams then her saw blood
run in streams mingled with vulgars and Shentlemens blood, her could not know
her consanguinity nor her Cusen gentle blood, but was all running out of her
veins and bellies, her cannot make terrible descriptions of awle these cruel
fights, and horible Battles, which her was spectators and beholders of, but
her can tell, that her was never put into such astonishmen's, and amazements,
in all her days, for her cannot with all her fancyes, and imaginations set out
her Pictures, and deadly representations of this hot skirmish, her know not
about what, but mere piples, and papiles, and words, such as her never knew
about Pregorgatives, and Commissiones of Array, her do not know, but her was
ready to her breeches, bewray herself, without authorities, but upon plain
necessities, and fears and frights; but her is now in all humility and
submision ready and desirous to crave pardon for her following and obeying the
Commission of Array; her thought like the poor dog, that her was going to a
breake-fast, when her was going to hanging, her thought to have marched out of
her Country, only so bring the King and Parliament to meet lovingly, but by
the way, many thousand Devils met us, and spet fire against us, and sent us
such hot answers, as bounce bounce, that her was almost deaf, and was lamed in
all her senses, so that her thought her should never hear her Welsh Harps more
melodiously playing: and besides the smoke of gunpowder spoiled her stomach,
that her did wish her had been tosting Cheese by the fire side in her own
Country, there her could fight at country Machets, and crack her Cosens crown,
and he rook it for good payment for a Welsh Runt: but here at Kinton, our
Crowns were cracked, and yet they would be content; but we must pay our own
dear lives, and keep us from running home to Wales, though our legs was as
good and better than their hearts. Her was truly conformed before her went out
of her Country, that her should get honor, and great store of pillage, and
good pay for her labor, By Gods plutra nails, her had such good pay, that her
desire never to be so paid again; the Redcoats did so pay her, that her was
fain to run from her pay, mark her that now, her could have found better
occupying at home, and better payment made there, then her did at this Kynton
battle, for her lost one arm, and almost one leg, in so much that her shall
never deal truly, nor go uprightly with her best friends; Yet her do much
thank her Fates in that her has but one hand, for now her can pilfer and
stease but half so much with one, as her could before with two; and so her
shall not be hanged so soon as her should, if her had 2 hands. Her was likely
drilled to Coventry, and it was told her that it was a very rich town, and good
store of pillage was therein, and that he should have fine shirts and fine
sheets, her must confess that put her into some heart to get some shirts, for
her had never a one of her back, but a couple of borrowed napkins tacked
together, and so put upon her shoulders, and with never a sleeve, and those her
wore 4. months, in so much that her had near threescore and two Moabites
about her, besides Nitites and Jebusites, which leapt like our Welsh goat over
the pales and over the mountains, when we hunt her for Venison.

And for her running away, her think is very good wisdoms, for her do remember
her welsh proverb, de huma Comrade, bo in daneth Whee, that is, one pair of
heels is worth two pair of hands: yet her can shustifie that her Countrymen
did not face about and run away the first, but did stoutely stand to it, and
for her part, her did but wink twice in shooting thrice her gun off with a
pellet in it, but her was in such a sweat with it, as if it had bin Saint
Taffies day when all her cheeses are set to the fire to roast for joy.

And her tell her that for her own credit, that it was the English man that
first run away; and it does much rejoice her heart to hear, that not only some
of her Countrymen run away, but that diverse English Captains not being content
to run away on foot, but rode away like cowards upon their horse backs, and
with the Parliaments money also, bidding their soldiers shift for themselves,
for they were all lost men. Nay her do caknow them very well, there was one
Captain Ramsey and Captain Frith, and another Captain called Richard Parker,
who looks like Bul-beefe, and would have frighted her with her looks, her do
warrant her, but her like a coward run away, and did not like an honest man go
throgh-stich with his work; such a rascal would be hanged if her was in our
Country, yet her would not have him hanged, for that would spoil his
whistling, for if all run-aways should be hanged, what would become of her none
self: But her would have him marked for a white-liver'd slave, and where her
had a horse of 12. l. price; her should have one of 12. s. the next time, and
her Lord General should serve the soldiers as her cozen Julius Caesar did when
her first entered England, brought all his men in ships, and when he had landed
them, commanded the ships to be sent home again, so that they had no hope left
of running away, but to stand to it, and fight like men, or dye like cowards;
So her would have her Parliament let none of her Captains have horses above 10.
s. price, that if they offer to fly or run away, they may soon be overtaken
and punished: or so branded that they may be taken notice of for fugitives: for
her own part (alas poor Taffie) all that her could get for guarding up her K.
to the Parliament was the loss of one of her arms, and almost one of her
legs, the Tivell rake her commission of Array, and her also, if ever her fight
again for the Array, for it made her in a woeful case; I would I had her stones
between her anvill at home, that first invented or found out the commission of
Array, but I will conclude, as her cozen Sir Francis Jones did upon the
Sessions house bench when her cozen was condemned to be hanged, he starting up
hearing her Counteyman cry for mercy, said it is well you escape so too, so say
I it is well I escaped so too, and so her will march home to his own Country.

The welsh men's new Oath
IN considerations therefore of the premizes bloody and cruel, beyond all
comparrisons and stories of all ancient fights, we the old Britains do
here, from the bottom and top of our hearts, which do trouble her yet to
think on that Battle, do here promise and take an hundred Oaths upon
books, that we will never hereafter be so mad, as to go a gathering of wool,
or wealth, or moneys, upon the ways of pillaging and plundering, and getting
good estates, and apparel, by the commission of Array, her will rather go in
her country habit, rather then to venture for the good apparel and get nothing
but knocks, nay and loose her life, and march bare footed, against her good
friends, the Parliaments forces; and her desire that the Parliament would not
take their forwardness to assist these Commissioners of Array, as a contempt
against all their honors and urships, for her will hang her self, if ever her
be seduced and led away to look our Army in the face again, or to fall to
blows in open field, where her blood was like to have been shed, had not her
being wiser then the rest, run away, and so having escaped with her life, has
made this Recantation, and does desire all the worships of the parliament, to
pardon her great temerities and erours in standing for the Commission of Array,
and her do vow and make protestation, that hereafter her will be wise and
discreet in the effusion of her true british plood, and will upon all
occasions handle her arms and legs in defending the Protestant Religion, be
they what they will, and her King and Country, this is her true Resolution and
Recantation.

The Welchmans doleful ditty,
to the tune of Ohone, Ohone.
IN Kinton Green
Poor Taffy was seen,
O Taffy, O Taffy;
Taffy her stood
To the knees in blood,
O do not laugh ye;
But her was led on
With false Commission,
To her unknown;
That poor Taffy her self
Might live in health,
But her got blows for her wealth
O Taffy poor Taffy.
Their crievous fight
Did make day night
O Taffy Taffye;
Her would be flying,
Likt not dying;
'Twas bad Epitaphe,
Her sword and spear
Did smell for fear
And her hearts were
In a cold plight;
Made Taffy outright
His poor Britches beshite,
O Taffy O Taffye.
To Guns did so fart
Made poor Taffy start
O Taffy O Taffye.
Her go barefoot,
Then so go trot,
O do not laugh ye:
For her was banged
Because her had gang'd
Under the command
Of Array,
Who had for her pay
Many a sound creat knock that day.
O Taffy Taffye.
Her go in freeze,
Eat bread and cheese,
O Taffy O Taffye.
Feed with Goats
Without old Groates,
O do not laugh ye,
Had you bin there
Where her did appear
With cold cheer
In knapsack,
You would then alack
For fear have turned her back
O Taffy O Taffye.
Her will now invent
How to repent,
O Taffy O Taffey,
And for want
Of words her recant,
O do not laugh ye:
For her will be swore
Her will do no more
Though her be poor
And too true
Valor her will show
To more in such create crew
O Taffy O poor Taffye.
Her do conclude
In doleful mood,
O Taffy O Taffye.
Her will weep
To Goats and Sheep
O do not laugh ye,
For her be anger,
And then hang her,
If in danger,
Her come.
Pox upon a Gun,
Has spoiled her going home,
O Taffie poor Taffie.
FINIS.
