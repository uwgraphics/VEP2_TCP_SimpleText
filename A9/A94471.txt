To the Honorable the Commons of ENGLAND in Parliament assembled. The humble
Petition of many well-affected Citizens, and other the freeborn People of
ENGLAND,
Shows,
THat as Your Petitioners conceive it to be far beneath the Authority and
Honor of this House to be the Executors of the Law; so likewise we apprehend
it to be contrary to the clear fundamental Laws of England, for the Lords
(in criminal Cases) to exercise any jurisdiction over Commoners.

That we collect from the Common and Statute Law, that no Freeman ought to be
taken, and imprisoned, passed upon, censured or condemned, but by the Lawful
judgment of his Equals, and whatsoever judgment shall be otherwise given is
to be holden for naught.

That nevertheless Sir John Maynard, Sir John Gayre, Alderman Bunce, Alderman
Langham, Alderman Adams, Com. Copley, Master John Wildman, and many other
Commoners have been and are imprisoned, and the Lords have assumed to
themselves a jurisdiction over Sir John Maynard, and many other Commoners.

Your Petitioners therefore most humbly pray, That no Commoner be henceforth
imprisoned during pleasure; but only until the time of a Legal Trial. That
the Lords do not henceforth exercise any jurisdiction over Commoners in
matters criminal; but that Sir John Maynard, and all other Commoners may enjoy
our Ancient Freedom of indifferent Trials by our Equals: And that all Cases
elsewhere determinable (according to the Declaration of this Honorable House)
be left to the ordinary courts of Justice unto which they legally appertain.

And we shall daily pray, etc.
