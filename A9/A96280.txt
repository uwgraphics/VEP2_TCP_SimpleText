In Memory of that Lively Pattern of true Piety, and unstained Loyalty, Mrs
SUSANNA HARRIS, The Virtuous Wife of Capt. JOHN HARRIS, who dyed the last day
of October, 1649.
WIthin this sacred Dust SUSANNA lies
Obscured from false-accusing-Elders eyes:
Once Independent, as are they that be
The Servants of One-God, and none but He.
A Leveller in Folio, such an one
As Loved to Level an Vsurped-Throne
A Royallist besides, (and here is all
The Sable that attends her Funeral.)
For, She her Crown, her Country, and her Mate,
Preferred and Fancied more then Earthly State.
But now she is gone: it is meant her Better-part;
The rest lies here, to Crucify His Heart
Who Wounded Hers; Death has dissolved the band
Which Life and Love had knit 'twixt heart and hand.
"Happy those Husbands thus in Women blessed!
"Thrice happy Wives, which merit such a Test!
Rest Glorious Saint! and may her virtuous life
Last the Choice Emblem of the Rarest Wife:
Until the Trumpet sound, and bid, Arise,
T'imbrace that Blessed union never dies.
Good Lives and Actions usher us to Bliss,
And not Culled Language, or Rich vanities:
So that Vain Praises were an useless sound,
A sprinkling Water upon Holier Ground.
Let such whose ill-spent-Lives have rendered cause
Of just Suspicion, lean on frail Applause,
She needs no Gawdy-Fictions: Nor is it fit
Her Graces be Profaned in Home-spun-wit.
Since fair SUSANNA in her Garden-Bowrs
Was not more Pious, or more Chaste than Ours.
W. G.
