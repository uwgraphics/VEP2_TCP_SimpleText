To the Reader.
MAny Writers do make doubt whether this Land had, ever any King called Bruce:
same do utterly deny that any such man was but the most Authors do off me
that when Troy was spoyted and burnt by the Greeks, the (...), and there was
married to a daughter of L^inu^ King of Fulcany, (now the Dukedom of Florence)
by which Lady he had a son named Ascanius, who was the Father of Silvous
Posthumus; that Silvin was the Father of Brute. Brute being but fifteen years
old in fortunatly (as he in a forest was hunting) slow his Father Silvius with
an arrow as he shot into a thicket, thinking he had shot is a Deer: for which
he was banished from that Country, and shipping himself wish a good (or
great) number of his followers be land d here and was the first King of this
Land. This is the opinion of many ancient and learned men, and diverse Writers
do oppose those authors: but I am resolved that ane King or other had Reign
here when it was first a Kingdom and because this Land bears the ancient name
of Britain (or Brutaine) I do hold with such Authors as for Brute do hold
with me.
