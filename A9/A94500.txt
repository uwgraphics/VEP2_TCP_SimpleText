TO The honorable, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of the House of
COMMONS Assembled In the High Court of PARLIAMENT.
The humble PETITION Of the Mariners and Seafaring-men and other Inhabitants
of STEPNY, and some other adjacent parts.
Humbly showing,
THat the Petitioners cannot but be sensible of the present great distractions
of this Kingdom, the Religion of our Church so well approved by this
representative body in former times, and established by Law in Parliament,
being now in danger of being supplanted and ruined by the cunning and violence
of Papists and Sectaries, the peace of our state so necessary to the enjoyment
of all temporal blessings changed into an unnatural civil War, which
induces a confluence of all miseries, the honor of our Nation impaired, the
wealth and treasure exhausted, and our late flourishing Trade and Traffic
upon the Sea (by which most of the Petitioners have their livelihood) so much
decayed, that most of the Merchants Ships ride at Anchor in the River, neither
now employed, nor (without sudden redress of these mischiefs) likely to be
employed in merchandise again, the EXCHANGE less frequented, many Shopps
already shut up, the men for want of Commerce giving over their Trades, and the
Petitioners constrained to remain at home without any employment, spending
upon their small Stocks, and having no use of that Credit which they were wont
to have, both with the abler Merchants at home, and with strangers abroad; So
as without speedy Remedy (by your tender care and compassion) they are likely
to be soon overtaken with extreme poverty, or enforced to follow the council
of necessity for their Subsistence.

And therefore they humbly pray (the premises considered) that this honorable
Assembly will be pleased seriously to weigh their distressed condition, and to
make, or accept, such Propositions as may, with the true Reformed Protestant
Religion, His Majesty's honor, and the Peoples safety, effectually and really
conduce to a timely composure of the present distractions; And to settle again
the Peace of this Kingdom, without which no Right or Liberty can be enjoyed,
no Truth determined, no Law have any force or vigor, nor the declining and
almost lost Trade of the Land ever be restored.

And the Petitioners shall pray etc.
