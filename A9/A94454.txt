TO THE HONORABLE House of Commons assembled in Parliament. The humble
Petition of many thousands of Citizens, and Inhabitants in and about London.
In all humility showing,
THat Mr. William Trigg Practitioner of Physic, the last great sickness did
by Gods blessing upon his Physic and Chyrurgeries, cure many that are still
living; and did abundance of good to all sorts of people in and about this
City: when most of the College Doctors deserted us, since which time your
Petitioners have for above twenty years, in their several times of
sicknesses, and infirmities taken Physic from him; for whom they have great
reason to bless the Lord, who has made him the instrument to restore us, and
many of our several Families, to our former healths; and in which time, we do
verily believe in our consciences, that he has done good to above thirty
thousand Persons; and that he makes all his Compositions himself, not taking
any thing for his Physic from poor people; but rather releiving their
necessities, nor any money from any of us for his advice; and but moderately
for his Physic: his custom being to take from the middle sort of Patients,
12d. 18d. 2s 2s. 6d. as they please to give, very seldom five shillings,
unless from such as take much Physic with them together into the Country:
Having done many wonderful cures of diverse of your Petitioners, and others who
had long languished, and spent great sums of money upon other Physicians and
left by them as incurable

That there is a good and wholesome law made in the 34th. year of King Hen 8.
c. 8. Permitting every man that has knowledge, and experience in the nature of
Herbs, Roots, and waters, to improve his Talent for the common good and health
of the people; the Copy whereof your Petitioners have humbly presented, to be
as a glass to represent the faces, and conditions, of things to be such now,
as formerly they were.

WHerein the Parliament holden at Westminster, in the third year of the Kings
most gracious reign, amongst other things for the avoiding of Sorceries,
Wichcraft, and other inconveniences, it was enacted that no person within the
City of London, nor within seven miles of the same; should take upon him to
exercise and occupy as Physician, or Chyrurgion, except he be first examined,
approved and admitted by the Bishop of London, and others, under and upon
certain pains and penalties in the same Act mentioned. Since the making of
which said Act, the Company and Fellowship of Chyrurgions of London, minding
only their own lucres, and nothing the profit of the diseased, or patient,
have sued, troubled, and vexed diverse honest Persons, as well men as women,
whom God has endowed with the knowledge of the nature, kind, and operation of
certain herbs, roots, and waters, and the using and ministering of them, to
such as are pained with customable diseases: As women's breasts being sore, a
pin and a web in the eye, uncomes of hands, scaldings, burnings, sore mouths,
the stone, strangury, saucelim, and morfew, and such other like diseases. And
yet the said persons have not taken any thing for their pains, or cunning; but
have ministered the same to the poor people, only for neighborhood and Gods
sake, and of pity and charity. And it is now well known, that the Chyrurgions
admitted will do no cure to any person, but where they shall know to be
rewarded with a greater sum, or reward, then the cure extends unto; for in
case they would minister their cunning to poor people unrewarded, there should
not so many rotte and perish to death, for lack of help of Chyrurgery, as
daily do; but the greatest part of Chyrurgeons admitted be much more to be
blamed, then those Persons that they trouble: For although the most part of the
Persons of the said craft of Chyrurgeons have small cunning; yet they will take
great sums of money, and do little therefore, and by reason thereof they do
oftentimes impair and hurt their patients, rather then do them good. In
consideration whereof, and for the ease, comfort, succor, help, relief and
health, of the Kings poor Subjects, Inhabitants of this his Realm, now pained,
or diseased, or that hereafter shall be pained, or diseased. Be it ordained,
established, and enacted, by the authority of this present Parliament, that all
time henceforth it shall be lawful to every person being the Kings subject,
having knowledge and experience, of the nature of herbs, roots, and waters: or
of the operation of the same by speculation, or practice, within any part of
the Realm of England, or within any other of the Kings Dominions, to practice,
use, and minister, in and to any outward sore; uncombe, wound, appostumacions,
outward swelling, or diseases; any herb, or herbs, ointments, bathes, pultes,
and emplasters, according to their cunning experience and knowledge, in any of
the diseases, sores, and maladies before said, and all other like to the same;
or drinks of the stone, and strangury, or agues; without suit, vexation,
trouble, penalty, or loss of their goods, the foresaid statute in the
aforesaid third year of the Kings most gracious reign, or any other Act,
Ordinance, or Statute to the contrary hereof, heretofore made in any wise
notwithstanding,

Yet notwithstanding the President, and College of Physicians in London,
envying the happy success of his Physic; endeavor by all means possible to
suppress the said Mr. William Triggs Practice, and have maliciously preferred
several Inditements against him at the common law, and have brought an
information, and an action of debt upon him, etc. Prohibiting all men from
practicing Physic, which are not by them licensed; which was made to suppress
Mountebanks, who then cozoned and deluded the people; and not to be put in
execution against him, who is the poor peoples honest Doctor, as may appear by
thousands of our hands hereunto annexed: Endeavoring to make him odious in the
sight of all men; who under God has preserved thousands of our lives; whom God
has endowed with the knowledge of the nature, and operation of Herbs, Roots,
and many wonderful secrets in Physic, and Chyrurgerie; wherein if the said
College shall prevail, many poor people must of necessity perish to death,
for want of help in time of sickness, from which there is no exemption, for
they are not able to pay great fees to Doctors, and Apothecaries bills which
cost more then his advice and Physic: Nor can we have access unto them when
we desire, which we familiarly have to Doctor Trigg to ourgreat ease and
comfort.

Forasmuch as your Honors have declared, that the health of the people, is the
supreme law; and that he who in the great plague, adventured himself for our
good, ought to be encouraged in his practice in times of health. Your
Petitioners hope that if there be any penal law in force, that is distructive
to the health and welfare of the people: Your Honors will be pleased in your
great wisdoms, to suspend the execution thereof; rather then to suffer many
poor people to perish to death, for want of help; and your Petitioners
therefore most humbly beseech this Honorable House, who has done such great
things for the saftie of this Kingdom, for the sakes of so many poor people,
in and about this City, who are deeply concerned herein, as much as their lives
are worth; to Order that the said D. Trigg, shall and may quietly, and without
any disturbance, or penalty, practice and administer Physic, in and about this
City, notwithstanding any Charter, or law to the contrary. And that your
Honors would be pleased, that such moneys as have been recovered against the
said William Trigg, may be remitted unto him; For why should any man suffer for
saving his neighbors life.

And your Petitioners, who have faithfully adhered to your Honors in this
great cause, shall have reason to magnify your Honors Justice in the care and
preservation of our health, a thing most dear unto us; And shall ever pray for
the Prosperity of this Honorable House.
