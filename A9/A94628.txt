To the Right Honorable, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of
London in Common Council assembled.
The humble Petition of diverse Citizens of London, who earnestly desire the
peace and happiness of the Parliament, City and Kingdom.
SHOWS,
THAT your Petitioners being deeply sensible of the misery brought by the late
unnatural War, and of the general distractions, fears, and iealosies of the
City and Kingdom at present; do with all thankefullnesse accknowledge the
great care, wisdom, and fidelity of this honorable Court, in your late
transactions between the City and the Army, your endeavors to prevent all face
of Hostility, and surmises of opposition against them; your prudent choice and
seasonable sending so worthy a Committee to preserve Peace, and beget a right
understanding, between the Parliament, City, and Army.

Your Petitioners do most humbly pray, that this honorable Court will still
effectually proceed in so good and necessary a work, and for the preventing of
the scarcity of provisions, with many other inconveniences by so near
approach of the Army, you would be pleased to redouble your endeavors with the
high Court of Parliament; for the granting of the Armies just, and lawful
defiers, so far as they may stand with the honor and safety of the Parliament
and Kingdom; and to use all possible means, to hinder any further differences
which may arise, that we be not destroyed by the clashings of them by whom we
hope to be delivered.

And your Petitioners do further most humble pray, that as your wisdoms have
thought fit that this City be put into a posture of defense, for the prevention
of unlawful vilolence and intestine tumults; so care may (according to your
own resolutions) be taken, that no extraordinary forces be listed or employed,
whereby any appearance, much less reallity of opposition may be against the
Army, whereby this City and Kingdom should become engaged in a second and more
bloody War, which we pray God in mercy to divert, all which your Petitioners
leave to the wise consideration of this honorable Court.

And shall ever pray, etc.
This Petition was delivered the 17 day of June, 1647. and the Petitioners had
extraordinary thanks for the same, by the honorable Court.
