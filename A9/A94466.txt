TO THE Honorable the Commons Assembled in PARLIAMENT, The Humble Petition of
diverse Freeborn Englishmen, inhabiting in the Cities of London and
Westminster, the Borough of Southwark, Hamblets, and places adjacent.
SHOWS,
AMidst our continual griefs and anguish of Spirit, wherewith we have been
long time afflicted, through our sense of pressing burthenous necessities,
which lie upon us, and iminent dangers which perpetually threaten us,
occasioned by the omission of settling the Government of this Nation, upon
those foundations of equity and freedom, which were made the only justifiable
grounds and ends of the late violent bloody consuming and chargable War, and of
all the extraordinary actings and proceedings of the present Parliament and
Army, out griefs have been often mittigated, with remembrance of the many,
full, ample and zealous promises and Protestations, made by both unto the
people of restoring them, to all their Rights and Liberties, and of delivering
them from all kinds of oppression, usurpation, and Arbitrary Proceedings; for
how was it possible for us, but to hope real performances thereof, when they
avouch, that the complete settlement of the Liberties and peace of the Nation
is that blessing of God, then which of all worldly things, nothing is more dear
or precious in their thoughts.

That they esteemed all present enjoyments (whether of life or livelihood, or
nearest relation) a price but sufficient to the purchase of so rich a blessing,
that they, and all the freeborn People of England, might sit down in quiet
under their own Vines under the glorious administration of Justice and
Righteousness, and in full possession of those Fundamental Rights and
Liberties, without which (they say) they could have little hopes to enjoy
either any comforts of life, or so much as life it self, but at the pleasures
of some men ruling merely according to Will and Power.

Avouching also, that they were not a mere mercinary Army, hired to serve any
Arbitrary power of a State, but called forth and conjured, by the several
Declarations of Parliament, to the defense of their own, and the Peoples just
Rights and Liberties, and so they took up Arms in Judgment and Conscience to
those ends, and have so continued them, and are resolved according to your
first just desires in your Declarations, and such principles received from your
frequent informations, and common sense concerning those fundamental Rights
and Liberties, to asert and vindicate the just Power and Rights of this Nation
in Parliaments, for those common ends promised, against all Arbitrary Power,
violence and oppression, and against all particular parties or interest
whatsoever.

And that none might mistake them herein, they manifest a most deep sense of
the necessity, that the Members of the house themselves (by frequent elections)
might be capable of subjection as well as rule; and thereby be in a capacity to
consider other men's Cases, as what might come to be their own: also how unfit
and dangerous it was, that the supreme Power of the Commonwealth should be
fixed in the persons of the same men, during their own pleasures; That neither
by their original constitution of this State, was it, or ought it to continue
so, nor does it wherever it is and continues so, render that state (say they)
any better then a tyranny, or the People subjected to it any better then
Vassals: But in all States (say they) where there is any face of common
freedom, and particularly in this State of England, (as is most evident, both
by many positive Laws, and ancient constant Customs) The People have a right
to new and successive Elections, into that great and supreme Trust, at certain
periods of time (which say they) is so essential and fundamental to their
freedom, as it is, cannot, or ought not to be denied to them, or withheld from
them, and without which the house of Commons is of very little concernment to
the Commons of England.

These and the like full and clear expressions concerning our Liberties for a
long season, supported our often fainting hopes, as being willing to believe it
was not possible for them to be uttered in vain, at least that they would
never terminate in things contrary.

And after long and tedious expectation, we were much revived, when as no
sooner had the Authors of those large Promises and Protestations, by
extraordinary proceedings against the other Members invested you with Power,
(which they then also said, they did only in order to new successive
Parliaments to be speedily chosen) but imediately you likewise declare in
behalf thereof, and for the Petition of Right, stiling it that most excellent
Law: and that you would maintain inviolable the ancient just Rights and
Liberties of the People, in all things touching Life, Liberty, Estate and
Property, with all things incident thereunto.

But so it is, that now after more irksome expectations, our hopes dye daily
within us, and our griefs increase so fast, as like to overwhelm us; for what
place for hope have we left? or how is it possible for us not to grieve without
ceasing, whilst notwithstanding all those precious Promises, Declarations and
Engagements, for, and in behalf of the ancient just Rights and Liberties (and
upon which promises, and for which Liberties we with others have adventured all
we could in this life) new and succesfull Elections to that supreme trust of
Parliament, is not only withheld from the People, and so as that men dare
hardly affirm it to be their Rights; but whilst it is retained and fixed in the
persons of the same men, during their own pleasures, Laws are made of so
dangerous a nature, as men can scarce speak or do any thing for fear of losle
of Life, or Liberty or Estate.

How can we choose but bewail our own and the Nations sad condition, when
notwithstanding all those zealous ardent expressions for just Liberty,
acknowledged to be due to the People: That yet it should be frequent to
imprison Englishmen upon extrajudicial Prerogative-like Warrants, and that too
in such places, and remote Castles, whereunto belongs no legal
Goale-delivery, but where they are detained during pleasure, examined against
themselves search to find matter against them, and some are used in a more
barbarous manner, then those were called Puritans in the Bishops time.

Wh^lst Englishmen are made liable to attachments, by Messengers and
Pursevants. To have their goods destrained without legal Proceedings, and by
Persons not authorized by Law, to be tried in matters of property and estate,
by Committees; and in cases of life, by an extraordinary Commission of Oyer and
Terminer, or which is worse and far transcending all strain of the old
Prerogative by a High Court of Justice, and Trials by Jury, of twelve sworn
men, shall be withheld from any Englishman; how in the least is Magna Charta,
or the Petition of Right, those ancient fundamental Rights, either in
circumstance or substance made good.

Whilst Conscience is enforced to an Engagement, or to the refuser to forgo
all the comforts of life, and as an Outlaw, exposed to the wills of men, and
that Excise, Custom, and Taxes, are exacted as they are upon all sorts of
industrious People: Alas, what Liberty is left us? who is he that walks not
in Ieopardy all his life long, if these things be continued (which God defend)
enjoying neither any comforts of life, nor so much as life it self, but at the
pleasures of Men.) And therefore in Conscience to God (whose holy and dreadful
name has been often invocated to be a Witness of tbe reality of those Promises
and Declarations we are constrained at this time in most humble manner,
earnestly to beseech you, even by the mercies and forbearance of God) who yet
vouchsafes time and means to perform all your Vows.

1. That you will be pleased to render unto the People their essential Freedom
in new successive Elections unto the supreme trust of Parliaments, and that you
will review and repeal all such Laws, as make men Capital offenders for
words, or actions not Capital in nature.

2. That all persons imprisoned in any place, not subject to a Legal
Goale-Delivery, may be at least removed, Legally to Legal Prisons; to be
preceeded withal in due course according to Law, that they may be freed from
those dangers of Life and distraction of mind, occasioned by tedious
imprisonment, or sad examples by Trials, by extraordinary Commissions of Oyer
and Terminer, or which is far worse, by a High Court of Justice (which we pray
God may be never more heard of in England, as not knowing, any thing of greater
danger, or more expressly repugnant to our Laws and Liberties) upon pretenses
of crimes against the State, or of any other Prerogative-like suggestions.

3. That henceforth no man, may be attached, sentenced, fined or imprisoned, or
otherwise adjudged of Life, Limb, Liberty or Estate, by any other Authority,
but by lawful unanimous Judgment of twelve sworn men of the Neighborhood, by
Legal Officers and due process of Law, according to the true intent of those
ancient Fundamental Liberties contained in Magna Charta, and the Petition of
Right.

4. That you will suspend all further enforcement of the Engagement upon any,
as which exceedingly ensnareth the Consciences of the People; and that you will
dis-burthen all industrious People from those perplexities that lie upon them
by Excise and Customs: and raise all public moneys by way of Subsidies,
according to the ancient constant custom of Parliaments.

These things would you be pleased speedily to effect, all the Freeborn
People of the Land would then magnify the goodness of God for those rich
blessings; because, then they might securely sit down in quiet under their own
Vines, under the glorious administration of Justice and Righteousness, and in
the full possession of those Fundamental Rights and Liberties, without which
they have no comfort of Life; and for want whereof, and until they are firmly
established, the whole Land is likely to become a prey to Foreign
Confederates, presuming to find nothing here, but divisions, distractions, and
disatisfactions; and therefore we can never cease to Petition for them, and for
which as bound in Conscience,

We shall ever pray.
