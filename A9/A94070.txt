Good Reader,
THere is a double way of edification now in use in the Church of God, either
by long Tracts, or by short and pithy discourses: It Is not for us to determine
which is most profitable: Treatises have their use, and so have single Sermons:
sometimes it is good to see truths, not by piecemeal, but in their dependence
and frame, that the whole Doctrine may be brought together, and digested into a
method: On the other side, to say all that may be said in an argument, is a
burden and a prejudice to the common sort of hearers, who when they find one
point so much dilated and insisted upon, think that the knowledge of divine
truths will be so long and tedious a work, that in a despair of attaining
thereunto, they sit down with any slight apprehensions in the things of God,
and such thoughts as rather come upon them, then are found and searched out by
them. It concerns the ministers of the Gospel then, to use all methods to
gain souls to God: Sometimes to launch out into the commonplace, and larger
discussion of truths, that they may at once see the whole latitude and breadth
of them in one entire draught and delineation; at other times to consine
themselves to the express scope of that particular place which they have in
hand, that the point and branch of Doctrine proper thereunto may be more
earnestly and industriously enforced: In the first method we may discern both
the harmony and rich Adoro plenitudinem Scripturae. Tertull.
fullness of Scripture, whilst we see how much God has spoken in a little; and
how a few words of His, (like a small piece of gold) may without any forcing
and violence, be beaten out into so large an explication: in the other method,
truths many times come in fresher and sweeter upon the soul, as being drawn
more immediately from the fountain, and without the intervention of our Logic
and discourse, evidencing their deduction to the consciences of men.

In both these methods, did that worthy servant of the Lord Mr. Strong excel:
In a Treatise, who more copious and full? In shorter discourses, who more quick
and sinewy? Of his excellency in the former kind, the world has had a taste in
what of his has been already divulged, more of which kind also is intended for
the Press: now thou have presented to thy view, a collection of several choice
Sermons upon special occasions, some more public, others more private, and
therefore though in that respect there may be some difference between them in
beauty and freshness of color, yet they all have the character and impress of
Mr. Strongs spirit in them, and do plainly discover what hand has passed upon
them: the exceeding usefulness of the particular subjects, and that piety and
judgment that shines forth in the management of them, cannot but recommend
them to the respects of the godly wise, and therefore without any longer
detaining thee, (only to assure thee that these are from his own notes) we
commend thee to God, and the word of his grace, which is able to build us up,
and give us an inheritance among them that are sanctified.

Thy servants in the Lords work, Thomas Manton. John Row. George Griffith.


To the Reader.
THE Learned Author of these Sermons had he lived to have put the last hand to
his own elaborate works, they would have been better commended to the world,
then any care or diligence of Friends is able to perform. These Sermons and
some other Tracts formerly set forth, were left by the Author under his own
hand in such a character as none was acquainted with but only that Lady (of
whom I could speak as great things with as much truth, as of any, did not my
own nearness of Relation, and her own modesty forbid me) who made it her
business to learn his character before his death, and since to transcribe them,
by which means those (...) left by the Author under lock and key (as it were)
of an unknown hand, are brought forth and exposed to public view, for common
benefit. Those that knew him must needs say, that these Tracts were his own,
they are so like the Father; for as Seneca says of such as write books, they
present to the World morum suorum and ingenii Chrirographum: and our Author
has left his own picture drawn with his own hand, to the life, by which,
though dead, he yet speaks. His Sermons and tracts are not such, of which we
may say as (...). Pharmaca multa quidem bona mixta and noxia multa. Praetereat
si quid non facit ad stomachum. Martial.
Homer did of Egypt, and which may be too truly affirmed of many writings that
are published to the world: A miscellany of drugs, good and bad: We have
Antidotes in him, but no poison: and as Putean Sine periculo ullo electionis
decerpere omnia and libere liceat.
says of Cicero, we may more truly say of our reverend Author; you need not
use any great caution and care to pick and choose, you cannot choose amiss. He
has an excellent vein in his Sermons, as one says in the like kind, before
responsura fodienti, the farther you search, the richer treasure you are like
to find. It was the great infelicity of diverse of the Ancients, that though
they had magna ingenia, yet they had mixturam -- I will not add the other word:
they had magnas virtutes, and they had magna vitia also; Their raised Parts
were attended with such gross infirmities, as rendered them very obnoxious to
censure. And therefore Hierom speaking of Origin, writes thus. Epist. 72. ad
Tranq. Ego originem propter eruditionem sic Interdum legendum arbitror, quomodo
Tertullianum, Novatum, Arnobium, Apollinarem, and nonnullos Ecclesiasticos
Scriptores, Graecos pariter and Latinos ut bona eorum eligamus, vitemusque
contraria.
I think Origin may for his learning be sometimes read as other Ecclesiastic
Writers, so that we cull out what is good in them, and avoid the contrary; and
he Epist. 13. ad Paulin.
passes a smart censure on Cyprian, Lactantius, Arnobius, etc. And Hierom
himself which has censured others, is by several paid home in the same coin:
For Bellarmine Lib. 3. c. 6. de Romans Pontif.
observes several contradictions in Hierom, and Alphonsus a Castro Lib. 6.
adversus haereses tit. Episcopus; Apparet. ^. Hieronymum sibi ipsi minime
constare.
says, that in the business about a Bishop and a Presbyter, Hierom does not at
all agree with himself; nay, Bellarmine Lib. 4. de Euch. c. 10. art. 9. Non
possumus ex Patrum sententiis aliquid certi colligere quando inter se non
convenient.
says thus, We can gather no certainty out of the Opinions of the Fathers,
when as they themselves are not of one mind. And Joseph Scaliger Lib 6. de
Emend. Temp. sed cum delectu ejus scripta legenda esse non dubitabit quisquis
attentius legit, quam ipse Scripta veterum.
speaking of the most learned Eusebius, passes this sentence, without doubt a
choice is to be made in the reading of him. But I am very much mistaken, if
this our Author may not pass without any such censures, and may be read now in
print, as he might have been heard when he was in the Pulpit, without such
proviso's and cautions as are usually given in reading of many of the Ancients.
That which made his Sermons pass with so great approbation of the most
judicious hearers when he was alive, and will be a passport to his writings
though posthumous, was, he did follow the advice of the Apostle Paul to Tim. 2
ep. 2.15. he did study to show himself approved to God, a workman that need not
be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth: he made preaching his work and
business: he did not go to that (...) or as a (...), but he counted it his
greatest (...), the work God gave him to do, as Christ speaks, John 17.4. He
was of Melancthons mind, who had wont to Tres labore^ esse difficillimos;
Regentis, Docentis, Parturientis.
say, Three sorts of labor are most difficult: that of a Governor, of a
Teacher, and of a Woman in travel. He was often in travel to be delivered of
his Sermons, and he made that good, qui alios docere velit suo sudore Auditores
irrigare contendat; An instructor ought to spend himself upon his Auditory. He
was so much taken up in this work, that (to my knowledge) he was often in
watchings a great part of the night, besides his pains in his day-studies. What
Seneca reports Epist. 8. Nu^lus mi^ per otium dies exit, partem noctium studiis
vendico; non vaco somno, sed succumbo; and oculos vigilia fatigatos,
cadentesque in opere detineo.
of himself, may be affirmed of this our Author; I spend all the day and much
of the night in study, not setting my self to sleep, but only falling into it;
and he goes on, and Volup^ati^ some, vitae de^xerunt summ^ Illi Viri quod nobis
impenderunt, posteris nat^ and occupati.
adds, Great men of old bestowed the best part of their life upon us, as if
born for posterity: But besides that very great diligence and travel of head
and heart, and that intempestivum and pertinax studium that he laid out in his
Sermons, he had a special faculty of keeping close to his Text and business in
hand; which as it is very requisite in a Preacher, so it is very advantageous
to commend a discourse to the most judicious car. What Plinius secundus ^ci^t,
si materiae immoratur, non esse longum; longissimum, si aliquid accersit, atque
attrahit. Vides, quot versibus Homerus, quot Virgilius, arma hic Aeneae,
Achillis ille describat; brevis tamen uterque est, quia facit quod instituit.
said to Apollinaris in his Epistle to him concerning a Writer, is true of a
Preacher, that he should often veiw his title, I say, his Text; That which did
surther there contribute to his excellency in preaching, was his skill which he
had, and his deep insight into the mystery of Godlin^ss, and the Doctrine of
the free Grace of God; and as to the mystery of Iniquity within us, he was
well studied in the souls Anatomy, and could dexterously dissect the old man:
Then there is the mystery of Iniquity without us, of Satan and Antichrist,
which he understood very well, and by his knowledge in these mysteries, he was
able to advance the Kingdom and Honor of our Lord Christ in the hearts and
lives of his Hearers; and to discover the (...) Rev. 2.24. Satan's depths, and
to disappoint his (...) 2 Cor. 2.11. His plots and devices; as also to unvail
the Whore of Babylon, and to render her vile and contemptible in the eyes of
all. There was one thing more which did add very much unto him, and to his
labors in preaching, and make him successful in clearing many dark places, and
searching further into the deep Mines of the Word, and piercing into the secret
Oracles of God, and that was his constant recourse to the Originals, in which
he had good skill. By these means he went beyond most of his brethren in the
work of the Ministry; so that his Sermons had always something above the rdi
nary reach and pitch: and a certain strain, which did sapere saeculi sui
foelicitatem, answering the advantages and happiness of the age in which he
lived, which was more then Casaubon could say of Exercit. 34. in Baron. Vulgat^
sunt in his, nihi quod saeculi sul foelicitatem sap^at.
Baronius his Annals. The want of some or any of these Particulars render
Preachers very lame, and their Sermons thin and lean: of many of which, it may
be said as of Anaximenes when he began to speak, that there was (...), a flood
of words, a drop of sense; and in like manner Clem. Alexandrinus complains of
such, that they utter (...) a flood of insignificant words: Such Preachers
multa locuti parum dixisse videntur, talk much and say little; There was so
great weight both of words and sense in this our reverend Authors Sermons, and
so much of worth, that they did appear as good upon a narrow disquisition, as
they did seem to be when they were delivered: whereas the Sermons of many are
like the Orations of Cuju^ cum in dicendo copla speciesque aur^bus pla^e^
oculorum judicio spernebatur: multumque legentibus desideratum q^d audlentibus
placuisset.
Hortensius, Many tickle the fancy, whilst plausibly, and with some Pomp and
Ostenation delivered, but being scanned by a severer repetition, they prove to
have been vox and praeterea nihil, they vanish into a notion or nothing. The
ignorance, or at least the not so clear knowledge of the Doctrine of the
Covenant of Grace, Gods rich and free Grace, in the business of our salvation
was the cause anciently, and is still, of many errors in the Church. The
Author of these Sermons had arrived to an excellency and height in this
doctrine, beyond the most that ever I read or knew; Had he lived to have
perfected his labors about the Covenant of grace, I presume I may say they had
surpassed all that went before. Herein was the great defect of many of the
ancients: Casaubon Non negari posse videtur doctrinam de justificatione
peccatoris and causa meritoria salutis primis Eccle^ae temporibus and fere ante
Augustinum, vix satis dilucide fuisse expositam; constat sane apud
ve^ustissimos Patrum and nonnulles etiam posteriorum ^jusmedi sententias
interdum occurrere, quae nisi benigna interpretatione molliantur, ser^i non
p^ssunt, Exerc^in Baron. 1.
attributes the gross errors in the first times of the Church about the
meritorious cause of salvation, to arise from the ignorance of the Doctrine of
the free Grace of God in the Justification of a sinner. Nay, Concord. 159.
Graecos nisi caute legantur and intelligantur praebere p^sse eccasionem errori
Pelagiano.
Iansenius goes further; and Espencaeus Epist. 2. Tim. 2. d^g^ess 10.
speaks to the very same purpose, that diverse of the Greek Fathers from this
ignorance, gave occasion to the Pelagian heresy. What Chrysostom and Cassianus
his scholar thought and wrote of the grace of God, and also Cyril of Jerusalem,
may appear out of their writings: Cassianus Nos inquit primum bona ^ligere
oporter, and ^unc offert Deus quae sua sunt.
speaks their sense, We first choose what is good, and then God offers the help
of his grace, and determines our will upon the motion of it first. Nay, Vossius
speaks out indeed to this purpose: if any think that some who lived before the
breaking forth of Pelagianism, did attribute faith or the beginning of it to
the strength of nature, we will not contend with him. Lib. 4. Histor. Pelag. Si
quis putet allquos eorum qui ante exortam Pelagii ^aeresin vixerunt fidem vel
inltium sidei, conversion^s desiderium, certum spel and poenitentiae gradum
naturae viribus tribuisse; nolumus cum co ducere contentionis funem.
All this was to be imputed chiefly to that little knowledge which those
Ancients had in the Doctrine of the free Grace of God. If a Divine be lame in
this point, it is no wonder though he halts into Arminianism, and falls into
those Popish errors of the merit of good works, the corner stone of the Babel
of Rome. There is another defect which has brought much prejudice to the
Church, and that is ignorance in the Originals, the Mother of errors. Lud.
Vives De causis Corrupt. Art l. 7. de corrupto Iure. Magnam causam
corrupt^larum manasse ex imperitia Linguarum, quibus ipsum inscriptum est.
says, The reason of the corruption of the Law, and the same may be said of
Divinity, is, because those that were Students and Practitioners in it, did not
understand the Languages in which it was written. D. Reynolds, speaking of this
passage of Lud. Vives, adds: Apocryph. lect. 3. Sine dubio si scripsisset Lud.
Vives de causis Theologiae corruptae, notare potuisset hoe in Theologia saepe
usu venisse ut haliucinarentur, quoniam Graecum id esset in quo versabatur.
Doubtless if L. Vives had written the Causes of Corruption in Divinity, he
might have observed the occasion of errors herein, was the handling of it in
Greek: And Espencaeus speaking of the ignorance of former times, complains how
that Tim. Circa reformationis initia eam inter Clericos grassatam fuisse
linguarum originalium ignorantiam and barbariem ut in latinis authoribus Graece
nosse suspectum fuerit, Hebarice prope haereticum.
it was ^eemed as a fault in the Latin Writers, if they understood Greek; and
if Hebrew, a haeresie. What mischiefs have come upon the Church, upon the
unskilfulness of diverse of the Ancients in Original languages, would be too
long to set down. Thus I have endeavored to show wherein the strength of this
Author did lie; as also the sad consequents that follow upon the defects and
want of those particulars forementioned. There be diverse other things which I
might mention concerning this Author, but these were the chief, which out of my
observation and my intimate acquaintance I took notice of in him; by which he
came to be of very great note, and cried up beyond his brethren; by reason
whereof, had not God given him much grace, he might have been puffed up. For it
is most true, non minus periculum ex magna fama quam ex mala, great fame is no
less dangerous then a bad one: and perhaps this might be one great reason, why
the Lord was pleased to let loose the slanderous tongues against him: for
Quint. Dialog. Nemo codem tempore assequi potest magnam famam and magnam
quietem.
no man can enjoy a great fame quietly. It was a great affliction to him, and
so much the greater, by how much the nearer they were to him, which were at the
greatest defiance against him, as Tac. Hist. 1. Cui deer^ inimicus, per amicos
opp: essus.
says, He that wanted an enemy suffered by his own friends. My own familiar
friend -- that was the sharpest dagger and wounded deepest Whatever Tha^s in
Terent. Si ego digna hac contumelia sim maxim, at tu indignus qui s^ceris
tamen.
one may deserve, yet a friend should not be the executioner. But however his
Adversaries did very much endeavor to asperse him, yet he proved them to be
false and unjust (...); by the brightness of his conversation he did live down
those evil reports. It was not with him, as it was Prosper^ eloquentia quam
morum fama.
said of Domitius Afer, That he was a better Speaker then Liver: he was as
happy in the purity and innocence of his life, as he was for the power that
through Grace he erected in his preaching. What Simul fuls virtutibus simul
vitils aliorum in ipsam gloriam praeceps agebatur.
Tacitus said of Agricola, being under some calumnies, is true of him; he was
carried with much more speed toward glory, both by the malignity of others,
and his own excellencies. Thus I fear I have detained thee, Reader, too long in
the entrance; but I hope thou will have a keener edge to the dainties, that
thou shall meet with in the book. Farewell.

in the University of Oxford.

THey are great things which the Lord has spoken of the latter days, which are
called by the Apostle, 1 Cor. 10.11. (...). The ends of the world, so you
render it: but Grotius renders it (...), Ephesians. 1.10. The fullness and perfection
of times. Grotius.
Deus in omnibus actionibus prisci seculi semper ob oculos habebat temp^r a
Messiae, etc.

In which there shall be a perfection of Ordinances, and of Churches, and of
Prophesies; for the mystery of God is in the latter days to be finished, Rev.
10.7. There is a Kingdom of God which the Lord will set up (or cause to arise)
Dan. 2.44. Which though it shall begin in the days of those Kings, in the times
of the Roman Monarchies; yet it shall be the great Instrument in the hand of
God to destroy the Monarchies: for Jacob is in the hand of the Lord as a
threshing instrument in the middle of the Nations; either as dew from the Lord;
or as a Lion amongst the Beasts of the Forest; the Angels they poured out the
seven vials full of the wrath of God, which are the seven last plagues, they
came out of the Temple, Rev. 15.6. And this Kingdom of God shall not come to
perfection, it shall not arise unto its greatness, till judgment sit, and
dominion be taken away from the fourth beast, to consume and destroy it unto
the end, Dan 7.26,27.

Its true that the Church of Christ has a mighty efficacy upon the world, but
it is secret, invisible, and comes not under humane observation. Nisi oratione
and doctrina sustentaret Ecclesia mundum, uno momento perirent omnia. Luther on
Genesis 30


But there will come a time when the power and glory of the Church shall be
visible; The mountain of the Lords house shall be exalted on the top of the
mountains: Lactantius.
when the prophecy of Lactan. p. 579. shall be fulfilled, Confundetur omne
jus, and leges interibunt: non fides in hominibus, non pax, non pudor; neque
securitas, neque Regimen; and hujus confusionis haec erit causa, quod Romanum
nomen quo nunc regitur orbis, de terr a tolletur: And it is the duty of the
people of God to eye the prophesies, and to look out for their accomplishment;
for the day of the Lord draws nigh; then shall the Lord be King over all the
Earth, and Jehovah shall be one, and his name one, Zach. 14.9. The most
glorious and perfect prophecy of this Kingdom of God, which he shall set up in
the latter days, we have, Rev. 21.22. So in the last eight chapters of Ezekiel;
which that I may give you a little light into, There are three things mainly to
be explained: First, what is meant by the City and Temple, here spoken of? 2.
Unto what time this prophecy does belong? 3. What the waters are which issue
out of the sanctuary? which being explained, will be as a key to open all the
rest of the mysteries that are therein contained.

First, unto what time is this prophecy to be referred? for its a great part
of a Saints skill to be able rightly to discern and judge of times, that they
may know what to pray for, and what to expect, and when to cooperate and work
together with God: Now the times to which this prophecy relates, are the times
of the calling of the Jews, when their coming in shall be as life from the
dead; and a new Resurrection in the world, which will appear to us by four
Arguments.

First, it shall be after the Jews shall be converted; for it is said, The
house of Israel, shall defile my holy name no more as they have done by their
abominations, setting their threshold by my threshold, and their post by my
post: and by this means there was a wall of separation between me and them, and
in my anger I consum^d them, chap. 43.7,8,9.

Secondly, It shall be after the Tribes shall be united. After the sticks of
Joseph and of Judah shall become one in the Lords hand, Ezekiel. 37.19,20,23. And
therefore the Land is now divided amongst all the twelve Tribes of Israel,
Chapter 48.

3. It shall be after the glory of the Lord is returned; for the name of the
City shall be Jehovah Shammah, the Lord is there, chap. 48. ult. and he says,
I will dwell in the midst of them for ever, chap. 43.9. I will set my sanctuary
in the middle of them for evermore, chap. 37.26. For when he does return in to
them again, he will never forsake them; he did indeed hide his face in a little
wrath, and for a moment; but with everlasting kindness he will have mercy on
them, Isa. 44.8. Ezck. 39.29. Neither will I hide my face any more from them,
etc.

4. It shall be before Gog shall be destroyed; for he shall come up against the
people of Israel when they are planted in their own land, and when they dwell
safely, chap. 38.14,15. Then he shall come against them as a cloud, and cover
the land, and the Lord shall give unto Gog a place of graves in Israel, etc.
Therefore Israel must be planted first in their own land, and dwell there
safely: therefore I conceive it to be the same time with that Rev. 21.22. when
Jerusalem shall come down from God out of heaven; and when the glory of the
Lord shall be in the middle of them: the Tabernacle of God shall be with men,
and he will dwell with them: And after they are settled in their own land, and
the people of God have rest for a thousand years, then shall Satan be loosed,
who before was not bound from temptation, but from persecution; that he could
not stir up men to persecute the Saints; but as soon as he is loosed he stirs
up this last and great enemy, and he does compass the Tents of the Saints, and
this holy City; and then the Lord shows himself eminent and glorious in his
destruction: So that after Antichrist shall be destroyed, Satan shall be bound,
so that the persecution of the Saints shall cease; then shall this City and
Temple be built, which shall continue till the second coming of the Lord, till
the Heavens be no more: the time therefore is to come; do you long for it, and
pray for it.

Secondly, What is meant by the City and the Temple prophesied of Here? first,
it cannot be understood literally of a material City or Temple. Peter Galatinus.
Peter Galatinus tells us, that the Jews do commonly speak of a threefold
Temple. First the Temple of Solomon. 2. The Temple of Zerubbabel. 3. The Temple
of Jacob, which they say God showed unto Jacob when he had the vision of the
Ladder. Now it cannot be spoken of the Temple of Solomon; for that was
destroyed before the captivity, and therefore before this prophecy was
revealed, that was burnt with ^re: and for the Temple of Zerubbabel, the
measures and dimensions do no way agree thereunto: for the glory of the latter
house was inferior to the former, Ezra 3.12. in many particulars, as that the
waters issue out of the Sanctuary, and the trees that grow upon the River side,
and fishes in the River, etc. quae in secundi Templi instauratione nunquam
fuerunt: under the second Temple these things were not. The materials shall not
be in the Letter: Foundations of Saphirs, windows of Agats, gates of
Carbuncles, Isa. 54.11. and for the dimensions also, Rev. 21.16. the height of
the city shall be a thousand furlongs, which could not be in the letter
fulfilled: and for the Temple, there shall never be a restitution of the Jewish
worship; only the Lord does, as it is usual, express Gospel Ordinances and
Worship, according unto the Ancient pattern.

Secondly, it cannot be understood of heaven, for these Reasons. 1. It is new
Jerusalem that comes down from God out of heaven, Rev. 21.2. There is no Prince
in Heaven: but here the prince shall oppress the people no more. 3. There is no
priest in Heaven, nor no Ordinances, nor set times of worship, which is plain:
here there is the Priest, and their several portions, and set times of worship,
that when the people go in, the Priest must go in; and when the people go
forth, he must go forth. 4. There is no measuring in heaven: a city and a
temple that is measured, because its built, chap. 40.12. but this is a house
not made with hands, that cannot be meafured. 5. They shall in this City be
ashamed of all their former abominations, but in Heaven there is neither sin
nor shame, chap. 43.11. 6. This City shall have enemies that shall encompass
it, as we see, Rev. 20.9. They shall compass the Tents of the Saints, and of
the holy city, etc. 7. And the waters that do issue out of the sanctuary are
healing waters, and the fruit of the Tree of life is for meat, and the leaves
of it is for medicine; now there will be no healing at the last day; in Heaven,
there are the souls of just men made perfect, and they need no healing.

Thirdly, seeing it cannot be understood literally of a material Temple, nor
spiritually of heaven, it must then be understood mystically, of the Church of
Christ made up of Jews and Gentiles, when they shall be one fold under one
shepherd: Agnoscunt and Haebrei, quod ad futurum seculum, hoc est, ad Regnum
Messiae haec pertineant: Oecolamp. I^m.
Nos ad Christi referimus Ecclesiam, and quotidie in Sanctis aedificari
cernimus. St. Jerome.

But it is not a Temple that is always building, and a City: but its a City
that shall be built after such a time: and therefore I conceive it not to be
the Church of the whole New Testament, but barely the Church in the latter days
of the world, which is commonly called The city of our God: but this in a
special manner, Rev. 3.12. is called so, because of an Almighty hand of God in
raising it, and a glorious and special presence of God dwelling in it: and by
the Temple is meant those glorious ordinances of worship, which should be
exercised in this Church in the latter days: which is set forth by expressions
according to the Jewish pattern: as the manner of the presence of Christ
amongst the people under the Gospel is set forth by his presence amongst his
people of Israel in the Tabernacle, Rev. 4. so all the worship of God is set
forth to us according unto that Standard, pro ritu Templi; there is a Temple,
and Altars and incense, etc.

And that Ordinances of worship, the institutions of Christ, shall continue in
this glorious Church unto the worlds end, that's plain: for,

First, it is said, that the tabernacle of the Lord is with men, Rev. 21.3. and
that was a place for worship: if the Lord will have a Tabernacle amongst men,
he will have amongst men instituted worship still.

Secondly, the presence of God amongst men in this City is but (...), a Lamp,
Rev. 21.23. therefore it shines in a dark place, it is not such a presence as
makes it a perfect day as it shall be in Heaven; there will be no more the
light of the candle, etc. And therefore it is a light in Ordinances: for in
them as in a Lamp, the Lord gives unto his people light, 2 Pet. 1.10.

Thirdly, there shall be all manner of Ordinances in this City of God. First,
there shall be preaching; for there shall be abundance of fishers, chap. 47.
Secondly, there shall be the Sacraments; for the Lord is with them baptizing to
the end of the world: and they are to show forth the Lords death till he come.
Thirdly, there shall be discipline; for without are dogs, and they that love
and make (...), that lie, or do incline to it; and there shall be a greater
Spirit of discerning poured out this way, then upon any of the former Churches
of the Saints. Fourthly, there shall be Officers in this Church; for fishers
there are the Ministry, Ephesians. 4. and they are to last till all the Saints be
gathered and perfected; and there is a right and a privilege that belongs to
them, and not to others: they that have a right to the Tree of life, and may
enter in at the gates of this city; which every one had not a right to do; for
the dogs are without, as having no right to enter, Rev. 22.14,15.

3. What is meant by waters that issue out of the Sanctuary, which flow from
the presence of God in the middle of his people? it is to be understood first
of truths; A river of the water of life clear as Crystal, Rev. 21.2. Hic
fluvius uberrima doctrina Christi. So Brightman, Zach. 14.8. in that day,
Brightman. Zac. 14 8.
Living waters shall go out of Jerusalem; that is, Evangelii doctrina; so Drus.
Rev. 12.15. Drus. Rev. 12.15.
The Dragon is said to cast out of his mouth a flood after the woman: what is
this flood? his doctrine; Mede.
he cast out Doctrinam pestiferam, Arianismum scilicet, and sobolem ejus: Mede.

2. Because the effects that are here attributed to these waters, cannot belong
unto the waters alone; therefore I do not only understand the truths of the
Gospel, but the graces of the Gospel, and the gifts there bestowed, Joh.
7.38,39. Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living waters, etc. Joh. 4.14.
Whosoever drinks of this water shall thirst again; but he that drinks of the
water that I shall give him, shall never thirst, but it shall be a well of
water springing in him into everlasting life: its true, that there is not a
healing virtue, nor a quickening virtue in the word of it self: Wheresoever the
waters did come, they were healed, and every thing did live: but yet it is by
the word, that the Lord does work these great effects, and by which the healing
and quickening virtue of the Spirit is conveyed: for it is a good rule that of
Luther, All things in the Church are to be measured by the word; Florente verbo
omnia florent in Ecclesia, etc. Luther.


But if all places where the waters come are not healed, the Truths of God have
not the same power and effect upon all; there are some myrie and marish places;
First, what is meant by these myrie and marish places? the word (...) does
signify dirt or mire, such as man sinks into, that is, can neither go forward
nor backward, Ier. 38.22. thy feet are sunk in the mire; and it is such a place
where waters stand and have not a free passage, Job 8.11. Can the rush grow
without mire? and the other word (...) signifies a ditch, lacuna, a sink, or a
pit for dirty and foul water, Isa. 30,14. There is not a sheard to take water
out of the pit: and the resemblance between men that live under Ordinances
unfruitfully, and marish and myrie places, is very plain in three things.
First, in a marish place the water has not a free passage, but it stands, and
setles there: it has not affluxus and resuxus, it meets with many a stop, and
a dam: so it is with such a soul also: therefore the Apostle prays, that the
Gospel may run and be glorified, 2 These. 3.1. Now when is the word said to run?
First, when it meets with no stop, no opposition, but it has a free passage,
Cum libere propagatur: Secondly, when it goes through the whole man, and the
will of God commanded is subjected unto, Psalm. 47.15. when the word runs very
swiftly, that is, Glass.
Cum voluntas Dei peragitur, etc. Glass.

So that when it has no stop either in the mouth of the Ministers, or in the
hearts of the Hearers, then the word is said to run and be glorified: but when
there are some truths of God that men cannot receive, the heart makes up a
stop, a dam against them, they pass not through the whole man, to bring into
subjection every thought, 2 Cor. 10.6. but men imprison truth in
unrighteonsness, Romans 1.18. and will not suffer it to pass through the whole
man, through the whole soul, this is a marish place, etc.

Secondly, when the waters and the earth do mix together; this makes the mire;
when the Truths of God do mix with the corruptions of men; that either men can
hold some Truths, and yet keep their lusts: they can stand for truths, and yet
they live in their sins; and so shine as lights, and have their lamps, and yet
be unclean all the while; or else when men do make use of the Truths of God to
justify their sins, and they do plead the word of God to maintain their lusts;
they can stand for the Truths of God, yet will not leave their lusts, but seek
to cover them under it, Clem. Alex.
(...). Clem. Alex. for^ing the Scriptures to their lusts: Voluptatem sequi,
non quam audit, sed quam attulit. Aust. (...), Austin.
2 Pet. 3.16. They do wrest the Scriptures, and make them to speak that which
the Spirit of God never intended in them; and all is to favor some lust or
other; following the hidden things of dishonesty, they do handle the word of
God deceitfully, and make it speak peace when the Lord in the word does speak
terror, etc.

Thirdly, the longer men continue, the more filthy they grow; the longer the
Truths of God lie upon the heart of a man, and if they reform not, they make
him grow the more filthy and the more polluted: it makes a man's lusts the more
hateful, and the more defiling; for Ordinances do ripen men's sins as well as
their graces; and in this respect they may the more fitly be called myrie
places.

N^w the judgment is, They shall not be healed, they shall be given unto salt.

First, They shall not be healed; they had the waters flowing in upon them, and
by them many were healed, but they were not healed under them; and now in
judgment the Lord says, that they shall not be healed: those healing
Ordinances which work a very great change upon other men, and restore their
souls, they shall take no place upon them; that which was their sin shall be
their plague: they would not be healed, they shall not be healed; they would
not be purged, they shall not be purged: they will not come when they are
invited, they shall not taste of my Supper. A man cannot have a greater plague
befall him, then to be given up unto his own sin, and that which is the natural
fruit there of: Men that have lived under the Truths of God, and have not been
healed by them, the Lord gives them up as incorrigible in judgment: they shall
not be healed; that makes the Anathema Maranatha; reserved they are as
incorrigible for the judgment of the Lord at his coming; for this is that
curse upon them which is denounced by God most properly: its Gods ordinary way
to deal with sinners; that shall be their punishment which they chose to
themselves as their way of sinning; He that is ignorant shall be ignorant
still: and he that is filthy shall be filthy still; he that will not be healed,
the Lord says, he shall not be healed, etc.

Secondly, They shall be given to salt, which has a double interpretation
given of it: First, they shall be given up unto a perpetual barrenness, Deuteronomy.
29,23. The whole land is brimstone and salt; it is not sown, and neither grass
nor any thing grows therein. So Abimelech dealt with Shechem, he beat down the
city and sowed it with salt, Judge. 9.45. Psalm. 107.34. a fruitful land he
turned (...) into saltness, that is barrenness: and so Jerome, given to salt, Ut
in perpetuum frugibus careant, that they may not bear fruit for ever.

Secondly, Given to salt, ut alios condiant exemplorum sale: that is, he shall
be given up unto some exemplary judgment, that may teach all other men to
beware: For he that built his house, and not upon a rock, when the rain falls,
and the winds blow, he will fall, and the fall of that house will be great.

Doctrine. Some men that live under the purest and the most powerful
Ordinances, are in judgment given up unto a perpetual barrenness.

For the explication of this, there are these sour particulars. First, that God
does by the Gospel execute spiritual Judgments, as well as confer spiritual
blessings: Secondly, that of all judgments those that are spiritual are the
most dreadful. Thirdly, why the Lord does in Judgment give men up to a
barrenness under the Gospel. Fourthly, the manner how the Lord does this, and
how these Judgments are executed in an ordinary way.

First, the Lord does by the Ordinances of the Gospel execute spiritual
Judgments, as well as confer spiritual blessings: there are the greatest
curses as well as the greatest mercies come out of Zion: all Judgments both
temporal and spiritual, come out of Ordinances: for as they have the promises
of this life that now is, and that which is to come: so there belongs to them
also the threatenings of the life that now is, and that which is to come:
temporal Judgments come out of ordinances, Ezekiel. 10.2. Take fire from off the
Altar, and scatter over the city: they thought that the fire of the Altar had
served for nothing else but ad expianda scelera: Calvin. To expiate their sins;
but the Lord does let them see, that it will burn their City also, 1 Cor.
11.30. for this cause many are sick, and many weak, and many are fallen asleep;
and when the day of Revelation shall come, that the Counsels of God and the
hearts of men shall be made manisest, we shall then see that many of the
Judgments that now we complain of, will be found to be fire taken off the
Altar, and to be inflicted for the neglect and abuse of the Gospel, which now
we do very commonly attribute unto other causes, every man according as his own
fancy or party leads him: and also spiritual Judgments, as Rev. 4.5. there are
before the throne the seven spirits of God: all spiritual gifts and graces are
poured out in Ordinances: and there are out of the throne thundrings, and
lightnings, and voices, which note the terrible ways that the Lord has of
punishing wicked men for their contempt and neglect of the Gospel; Fulgura and
tonitrua terribilia supplicia significant, nec ullo modo vitanda. Br^ghtman.
Judgments from Heaven shall be poured out immediately upon the spirits of men,
and that from Heaven, Isa. 28.13. The word of the Lord was unto them precept
upon precept, and line upon line, here a little, and there a little, that is,
summacum industria and indulgentia. He did it daily, and he did it with a great
deal of meekness and forbearance, etc. but what was this for? to what end did
the Lord do all this? was it for their spiritual good? no, it was in Judgment,
that they might fall ba^kward, be broken and ensnared: there are no people
liable unto such terrible Judgments as they that live under Ordinances, and
whose plagues flow from them, Heb. 6.6,7,8.

There are many that live under the Gospel, and by the grace of it they come
unto the highest pitch of common works, they are enlightened and taste of the
heavenly gift, and are made partakers of the holy Ghost, taste of the good word
of God, and the powers of the world to come, yet afterward they fall away, and
that with a malicious and final Apostasy, with despite and revenge: the
reason is given of it: For the ground that drinks in the rain, and brings not
forth fruit answerable, is nigh unto cursing: for the curse is answerable unto
the blessing; and therefore they that live under the offers of the greatest
spiritual blessings, if they be neglected, and are unfruitful under them, they
are nearer to cursing then other men; which is the reason why in judgment they
are given up after such great and common works to apostasy and final
impenitency; because they have drunk in the rain of Ordinances and influences,
and have not brought forth fruit meet for him that dressed it; as its said of
Christ, Luke 2. it is true of the Gospel also; it is set (...), for the fall as
well as the rising of many in Israel: and let me tell you, the more spiritual
Ordinances are, the more spiritual shall the judgments be, as we see it in the
Ordinances of the Gospel; as they were more spiritual, so were the judgments
that were executed by them more spiritual: as the more spiritual any man's light
grows, the more spiritual will his temptations grow: so the more spiritual
Truths grow in any Age, the more spiritual Judgments grow; for answerable to
the measure of spiritual blessings, such shall be the measure of spiritual
plagues: and as the more spiritual Ordinances are, the more desirable; so the
more spiritual they are, if abused, the more dangerous.

Secondly, there are no Judgments of God like unto spiritual Judgments: those
are of all other the most dreadful, Isa. 13. Why should you be smitten any
more? ye will revolt more and more. Hos. 4.14. I will not punish your daughters
when they commit whoredom, nor your Spouses when they commit adultery, etc.
Impunity in sinning is the greatest punishment that can befall a sinner; but
the people that do not understand shall fall; that is, shall sin without
restraint, without control. Drusius.
He that is filthy, let him be so. Drusius. And the grounds of it are these.

First, because every spiritual Judgment is in it self a sin; it is a
judgment as from God, but in us they are sins also: now as there is not a
worse evil then sin, for sin is the greatest evil, so it cannot be punished
with any thing worse then it self: the Apostle cannot call it by a worse name
then it self, Romans 13.7. sinful sin; and God cannot inflict a greater
punishment then it self; and therefore after this life though the demerit of
sin shall cease, the obligation of the Law ceasing, as binding unto further
punishment, when a man is actually under the sentence of condemnation; yet
there is an obligation to the precept of the Law still: for thou art bound to
the precept as thou art a creature, and to the curse only as thou art a sinner;
now the nature of sin shall remain, though the demerit of sin has an end after
this life, and yet in Hell, pertinet ad damnationis poenam: As all holiness and
obedience in heaven, pertinet ad beatitudinis praemium. The one is a part of a
man's torment, as the other is part of a man's reward.

Secondly, because of the subject on which it lights, is the soul; the soul is
far more precious then the body; and as any mercy to the soul is far beyond any
blessing unto the body; so if the soul prosper, and the inward man be renewed,
it is no great matter what become of the outward man: though there be crus in
nervo, si animus in coelo: for it is in the soul that the Lord dwells, and in
the excellency of the soul that he does delight: therefore let the hidden man
of the heart be adorned: there is no adorning like it. Tertul. Bernard.
Aliter pigmentatae sunt vestes: Indutus purpura, cum conscientia pannosa. And
if the beauty of the inward man be so glorious, then there is no defilement
like to that of the inward man, nor no punishment I ke to that upon the soul:
as the Schoolmen say of Spiritual it is to be preferred before corporal:
Aquinas.
Eleemosyna cordis major quam corporis; spirituales Elcemosynae sunt
corporalibus simpliciter praeferendae: So may we say of Spiritual Judgments;
there are no judgments of God so much to be feared as Spiritual Judgments; as
there are no mercies so much to be desired as spiritual mercies: the prosperity
of the soul should be unto a Saint the measure of all prosperity; and the
misery of the soul and judgments upon it, should be the measure of all
miseries and Judgments whatsoever.

Thirdly, Spiritual Judgments are an argument of the greatest wrath and
displeasure of God: its true its a judgment that God does sometimes inflict
upon his own people, Isa. 63.17. Why have thou caused us to err from thy ways,
and hardened our hearts from thy fear? but yet it is a greater testimony of his
displeasure, then God does show toward the men of his good will; there is no
such evidence of his wrath in the world, as this is; and so it is to wicked men
also; for God to give them up unto their own hearts lust, and to deliver them
to Satan, as we see Christ did Judas: Austin.
Parcit iratus: and iratus Deus dat amanti quod male amat. Austin. Jerome.
Magna est ira Dei, quando peccantibus non irascitur Deus. Jerome. In the
afflictions of his people, Emendationi instat Deus. It is to restrain us, and
reclaim us, etc. But in spiritual Judgments the Lord does give a man up to
sin, and leave him in the power of sin, and under the dominion of sin, as if he
did never intend to do him good more.

Fourthly, its the saddest evidence of a man's reprobation, and a most dreadful
earnest of a man's damnation.

First, its a sad evidence of a man's reprobation; for there are three
consequents of reprobation, and both of them are spiritual Judgments.

1. Permissio peccati: the permission of sin.

2. In peccato derelictio: the being left in sin.

3. Traditio Satanae, to leave a man in the power of Satan, to give him over
unto Satan, to carry him captive at his will; and all these are spiritual
Judgments, Rev 13.8. and Rev. 17.8.

How came men to be ensnared with the Doctrine of Popery? and carried away with
that doctrine of devils? they were given up in Judgment to it, as an evidence
of their reprobation; for they worshipped the Beast, and received his mark and
his image, whose names are not written in the Lambs book of life, etc. for as
Spiritual blessings are pledges of election, so spiritual Judgments are
dangerous signs of a man's reprobation.

Secondly, they are a fearful earnest of a man's damnation, 2 These. 2.12. He
gave them up to believe that lie, that all they might be damned, who believed
not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness, Heb. 10.27. We read of an
(...), A receiving of a sentence, an eternal judgment in a man's own soul; when
a man carries in his own heart the sentence of his own condemnation; and there
is not a greater earnest of it in the world, then for a man to be given over by
God unto spiritual Judgments: for that is the portion that all the Heirs of
Hell have from the Lord; and as by the works of the spirit of adoption upon the
soul, there is an earnest of Heaven; so by the work of the Spirit of Bondage on
the soul in judgment, there is an earnest of Hell: the approaches of God are
in the one, and the desertions of God are in the other.

Thirdly, consider what a great evil it is to be given up unto this judgment
of a perpetual barrenness: the sins against the Gospel must be especially
requited by such judgments; for the Lord will have the judgment hold a
proportion unto the sin; now the more spiritual sins are, and the more
spiritual Ordinances are, the more spiritual must the judgment needs be: now
as there are no sins, nor no Ordinances so spiritual as those under the Gospel,
so there are no judgments that are so spiritual: and therefore, as God is a
spirit, and hates spiritual sins most, so it is most agreeable unto him, the
soul being a spirit, and having the main hand in the sin, to load that with
spiritual judgments.

But why will the Lord punish the neglect of the Gospel with a perpetual
Barrenness? Why shall the marish places be given to salt? The grounds are these.

First, consider of all Spiritual Judgments this is the greatest; of all
judgments the greatest are spiritual judgments; and of all spiritual
judgments, to be given up to barrenness is the greatest: for it is that unto
which all other Judgments tend, and in which they all end and center. There
are many other spiritual Judgments, as there is a Judicial blindness and
hardness of heart, a seared conscience, a reprobate sense; but what is all this
for? it is that we might bring forth no fruit to God; and that nothing that is
good might grow thereupon; and therefore it is that the Devil does catch away
the good seed, Matthew. 13.19. That we might be as the highway ground,
unfruitful: we complain of a barren earth by reason of the curse, Cursed be the
ground for thy sake; when thou tillest it, it shall not yield thee fruit; but
there are three sorts of Spiritual Barrennesses, which are far beyond this, and
are the fruits of a far greater curse; and they are barren Churches, barren
Ordinances, and barren hearts; there was never a more terrible monument of
temporal wrath, then the Lord showed upon Sodom and Gomerrah, and those Cities
of the plain which are now turned into the salt sea, and their smoke ascends
continually, where nothing lives, where nothing grows, neither fruit nor grass,
Deuteronomy. 29.23. and therefore called the dead Sea, as Jerome says, Jerome.
Quia nihil in se vitale habet: unde nomen mortis sortitumest. And if a fish be
at any time carried out of Jordan into it, Statim moriuntur: nth^l utilitatis
in se habet: ut simplex sermo testatur: the fishes presently die therein. Now
take an unregenerate man a barren soul, and he is compared here unto the dead
sea: for it is said that fishers shall stand from Engedi to Eneglaim: Eneglaim
in principio est maris mortui, ubi Iordanum ingreditur: Engedivero, ubi
finitur, atque consumitur: As great, yea a far greater monument of Judgment,
God gives unto a barren heart, then is that of the dead sea: which is nothing
else but a barren land, and barren waters, as they bring forth nothing that is
good of themselves: so neither is there any thing that can live or thrive or
grow in them: but if it come into it, it immediately dies: and so it is with any
thing of God or the Spirit of God that comes into the barren heart, it is like
unto the dead sea; what truths or motions soever are cast in, they die
immedi^tly.

Secondly, This is the greatest judgment, because hereby thou losest the fruit
of thy union with Christ, and the comfort of it: for the end of union with
Christ is fruitfulness; and it is a plain argument that he that brings forth no
fruits to God, was never married unto Christ: for Romans 7.4. We are said to be
married unto Christ, that we may bring forth fruit to God: There is a double
end of Marriage, convictus and proles: Cohabitation and propagation; and
therefore there cannot be a greater evidence that thou art not yet married unto
Christ, then this, thou art barren; for the Spouse of Christ is fruitful, and
he has no further a delight in them then as they bring forth fruit; for it was
the very end of his coming, That they might bring forth fruit, and that more
abundantly, and that their fruit might remain. Now to be much in fruitfulness,
to be rich in good works, is a great mercy. Si mihi daretur eptio, eligerem
unius Christiani rustici opus sordidissimum, prae omnibus victoriis and
triumphis Alexandri Caesaris, etc. Quando fidelis es, Deo placent etiam
Physica, corporalia, and animalia officia.

And how great a comfort is it, to bring forth fruit to God? because it is
fruit abounding unto our accounts, at the last and the great day; now as
fruitfulness is a certain evidence of our marriage to Christ: so barrenness is
a certain evidence that thou art not yet married unto Christ: and to be given
up in judgment to barrenness, is an earnest thou shall never be married to
him; and fruitfulness is an argument and a pledge unto a man's heart that Christ
will delight in him, as Leah said, when she had born a son, Now my husband will
love me; now he will be joined to me, now I have born him this son also. So may
a soul reason it out with Christ: Now I shall have his love, he will love me, he
will delight in me, he will dwell with me* ^ow I have yielded him fruit; for he
does delight in the fruits of his pleasant things, Cant. 5.12.

Thirdly, there is nothing that stands between such a soul and wrath: for Ioh.
15.2. Every branch in me that bears no fruit, my father takes away, that is, he
is cast out of the vine, of which he did seem to be a branch: and he withers,
and is thereby prepared for to be fuel for the fire: its true, if there were
the least fruit, or the least hope and expectation of it, it would be
reprieved: for, if there be but a cluster, Isa. 65 8. the Lord says, spare it,
for there is a blessing in it: but when Christ comes to expect fruit, and
finds nothing but leaves, no fruits thereon, then there is a curse near,
Never fruit grow on thee henceforth for ever. And by such a curse the man
withers at the root immediately. Chrysostom. de poenit. does allude to the manner
of men. Chrysostom.
Romanae leges poenam praegnanti deferunt: (...), If the Laws of men spare for
the fruits sake, how much more will the goodness and the mercy of God do it, if
there be but a cluster? but where there is no fruit, there is nothing now
between that and the fire: there is nothing so much as to defer the judgment.

There is a double curse upon a barren tree: not only the original curse which
is the ground and cause of barrenness: but there is a particular curse, when
the Lord pronounces a sentence of perpetual barrenness to this very end, that
the soul being cut off may wither, and may thereby be prepared for the fire:
and it is said, they are withered, and men gather them: they are cast into the
fire, and they burn: the fire of Hell burns so fiercely upon none as upon them
that are cast out as withered branches in judgment for their unfruitfulness.

Fourthly, why will the Lord give men over to a perpetual barrenness, that they
shall never more bear fruit, but as it is said, Jude 12. They are without
fruit, twice dead, and plucked up by the roots: as there is no fruit for the
present, so there is no hope of fruit for the future: for the Tree is plucked up
by the roots; these are men given up to perpetual barrenness; and the grounds
of it are such as these.

First, if any thing would make them fruitful, the gospel would: for we see
that if the waters that issue out of the sanctuary, run out into the dead sea,
the waters shall not be healed: and that there is as little hope of fruit from
such, as there is of the dead Sea, that it should be yet fruitful, and
therefore Zach 14.8. Living waters shall go out from Jerusalem toward the
first sea: this mare primum is nothing else but mare mortuum, or the dead sea:
and why are they called living waters? not only formaliter, or as they are
aquae perennes, such as do always flow; but effective, because they do beget
life where they come: and all things where the waters come do live; and there
are trees for fruit on every side, because the waters do come thither: yea,
even when there was as little hope either of life, or fruit as there it now in
respect of the dead sea.

Secondly, there is no other use to be made of them: they must be either for
fruit, or else for fuel: for men that live unprofitably under the Ordinances,
are good for nothing: as it is with a vine, if it be not fruitful, it is
useful for nothing else in the world: for a man cannot take a pin from it,
Ezekiel. 15.3. those that are branches in the vine: fruitfulness does prepare it
for pruning and soiling: for every branch in me that bears fruit, the father
purges that it may bring forth more fruit: so barrennes and unfruitfulnes does
prepare it for lopping, that it be cut down, that it may be profitable one way;
for all the garden of Paradise the Lord has reserved for one of these ends:
some of them, because he would not have them all perish, he has reserved for
fruit; and some when he has a long time expected fruit, and endured with much
long patience and suffering the vessels of wrath, prepared for destruct^on, now
he cuts them down, and lays them up for fuel; for Prove. 16.4. he made all
things for himself; and he will make some advantage of all the creatures to his
own glory; they shall be some way or other serviceable, either as vessels of
mercy, or as vessels of wrath, either to honor or to dishonor.

Thirdly, the Lord does this because therein are several provocations, that
they are unto him.

First, he has bestowed much labor upon them: for the father is the
husbandman; and his eye is in reference unto fruit, Isa. 49 45. I have
labored in vain, and spent my strength in vain: When he has dunged and dug
about it, not only the barrenness, but the loss of his labor then is a
provocation: then the Lord lays a man out of his hand: Ier. 6.29.
Then reprobate silver shall men call them, when the Lord has rejected them: I
would have formed you, I would have purged you, but now you shall never be
formed or purged.

Secondly, the Lord expects fruit, Isa. 5. I looked for grapes: for though
nothing is hid from God, yet he speaks after the manner of men, through his
patience, and long suffering, waiting upon them, that never bring forth fruit;
now it is a dangerous provocation to deceive his expectation, Isa. 5.12. I
looked for mourning, but there was rejoicing with the harps, etc. This iniquity
shall not be purged from you till you die.

Thirdly, they dishonor the Lords vineyard, that there should be found
fruitless trees; and therefore the Lord is provoked against them to take them
away, which he does by giving them up to perpetual barrenness: this Judgment
is that which the Saints fear and bewail, as Beza says, Beza.
Tanquam monstrum inter filios Dei sto: inutile lignum: to serve for nothing
but to fill up a room to the dishonor of the vineyard, and that is very
dreadful: Culcate me salem insipidum: good for nothing, neither for the land,
nor for the dunghill; and upon these grounds, the Lord gives up men to live
under the Ordinances of the Gospel unprofitably, that they have no saving
effect upon them; he gives them up a perpetual barrenness; they are given to
salt.

Use.
Use. Ye that live under the Gospel, and glory in it as the Jews did under the
Law, fear lest the Lord give you over to this Judgment; for many are called,
but few are chosen: A very dangerous thing it is to live under spiritual
Ordinances and influences with carnal hearts: and to this end, let me exhort
you to fear the several steps and degrees by which commonly God does give men
up to it; and they are such as these.

First, men miss of Christ, who is the only fruitful Root: for it is in him
only that you bring forth fruits, Joh. 15.5. without him you can do nothing;
when men begin their Religion with duties and performances, without a work of
regeneration, which tends unto Union with Christ, for the term of vocation is
union; they were never cut off from their old root, and never had experience of
an ingrafting work, never knew what it was to be translated, Col. 1.13. (...),
Verbum deductum ab iis qui colonias transferunt e natali solo: Its a Metaphor
taken from transplanting of Colonies: They are in him by profession only,
without any real implantation; for Christ as he is a vine upon earth, has in
him many unfruitful branches, though as he is a head in Heaven, so he has no
dead members; and this is the great ground of all barrenness, and so all that a
man does is but building upon the sand when it flows not from Christ, through
the union of faith, which is the ground of all fruitfulness: Non semper ore,
non semper meditor, sed vestio, dormio, bibo, comedo, etc. Haec omnia si in
fide fiant, tanquam recte facta divino judicio approbantur: As are my prayers,
so my eating, drinking, sleeping, and clothing my self; they are all Luther.
fruit abounding to my account in Christ; Luther, Genesis 33.

Secondly, he gives them up unto a heedless spirit in the things of God; so
much of Religion as shall uphold a form they take up, but they regard not the
keeping of their hearts, and the approving of themselves unto God in secret;
there is a cultus conscientiae, that is wholly neglected, 2 Kin. 10.31. But
Jehn took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord God of Israel with all his
heart: what show so ever they make of Religion, and how great so ever their
pretenses are, yet (...), Heb. 2.3. They neglect, or they care not for the
salvation that is offered therein. Bernard.
Vita uniuscujusque non cognoscitur nisi in conscientia. Bernard. A man's life
may seem as fair in a hypocrite, and as fruitful as in a godly man; but it is
the inward frame of the heart, and the constant care of that, in which Religion
does consist; and if a man do duties with a Spirit of inadvertency, they are
none of them fruits but leaves, and make way for a judicial barrenness.

Thirdly, he gives them up unto new opinions, and these do ingross the heart,
and take up the strength of the man, by contests of this nature; whereas the
kingdom of God consists not in meat and drink, Romans 14.17. and when men are
given up to this, then Hylar.
quas volumus doctrinas coaptamus: Hylar. That must go for true doctrine which
is agreeable to their apprehensions; and there is more pains taken in
contending for, and in maintaining of such opinions and things which we have
made our own, then there is about knowing or practicing all the Truths of
Christ, and the duties of godliness besides: and so the whole practice of
godliness is neglected, while the man is sinfully busied in novelties and
unpractical curiosities; and so urbem produnt dum castella defendunt: when as
in absoluto and facili stat aternitas. The things necessary to salvation are
easy; and as for lesser disputes, be not much in them; say, Elias cum veniet:
Let us leave this unto the day of Resurrection, which will declare of what sort
every man's work is, whither it be gold, or silver, hay or stubble; and the
truth is, this is a grave in which Satan has buried many a soul, causing men
to fall in love with their own births and apprehensions, and thereby to take
them off from the things which are of eternal concernment in the things of God,
which turn men commonly from Idolatry to Heresy.

Fourthly, the Lord gives them up to have their thoughts set much upon other
things, as it was with the thorny ground: the thorns sucking in the strength of
the soil choked the seed, Matthew. 13.

One is taken up about getting an estate; and another about raising a building
of honor; and another he is busied in the great affairs of a Commonwealth, and
he talks of making of Laws, defeating of enemies, saving of Kingdoms, etc. and
in the mean while he himself is lost, Matthew. 7 22. There is a man busy
preaching to others, whilst he himself is a castaway; and casting out devils
out of other men's bodies, when he himself is all the while in his inward man
possessed of the devil; and so while he is made a keeper of the vineyard, he
neglect to keep his own vine, Cant. 1.6. And so many a great Statesman gives
the same account at his death, as Luther brings in Cicero complaining: Luther.
Olim frustra me sapientem putatum: vocem indignationis and desperationis
pleniss^mam, etc. So that men never consider, by their gifts, and places, and
powers, they bear fruit among men, and be useful to a Civil State; they never
think of being useful to the people of God, and saving of their own souls: but
its one thing to live fruitful toward God, and another to be thought so by
men: as its said of Jeroboams son: There was found some good thing in him
toward the Lord God of Israel: Therefore consider, that may be good among men,
which is not good toward the Lord God of Israel.

Fifthly, After this the oath of God passes on the man: there is a swearing in
his wrath against men now, as there was against Israel of old, Hebrews 3. and
therefore we also must take heed; for this is the most dreadful Judgment can
come among men: and this oath though it be secret, yet it has this effect,
that the Spirit of God in the common works and gifts is by degrees withdrawn:
for though there be a decree that passes upon every man's eternal estate, as an
act of the Sovereignty of God: Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated: and
the foundation of God remains sure, the Lord knows who are his: yet there are
many strivings of the spirit of God about a man's eternal estate, before the
Lord swear in his wrath he shall never enter into his rest: for my spirit shall
strive with that man no more, Genesis 6.3. for as the Lord will not always suffer
his Ministers to speak in vain: therefore sometimes he says, they shall be a
reprover unto such a people no more: and therefore he will change the orb in
which the stars sometimes shine; he that has them in his right hand; and so he
will not always suffer his spirit to strive in vain: and therefore he does call
home this Spirit as his extraordinary Ambassador, when he prepares open war
against that man; and all Treaties of peace are at an end; the Lord will treat
with him about the matter of reconciliation no more.

Sixthly, after this there comes upon a man from the Lord as a fruit of this
oath, a spirit of slumber, and a heart that cannot repent, Isa. 29.10. the word
in the Hebrew is (...) the same that's used of Adam when the Lord took out his
rib, that though the man be in never so great danger himself, he is not
apprehensive of it; nothing does awaken him: and by this means he is put into
the condition of the devil; for he is made perfectly like unto the devil, and
is delivered over into his power; for 2 Timothy 2.26. (...), the word is properly
to return to himself after drunkenness; but now the Devil has not only a power
to make that man drunk, but to keep him so, that he never return to himself
again to his dying day: and as the devil sins without remorse, so shall he.
Bernard.
Peccare humanum est, sed in peccato perseverare Diabolicum est. He that
perseveres in sin, is as the Devil himself. As the fire of hell is unquenchable
fire, so is the sin of Hell unquenchable sin; and the Repentance of a man so
given over by God is not medicinalis but paenalis: its a Repentance in respect
of Judgment, not of sin: and as it has judgment its cause, so shall judgment
be its companion; that very repentance shall be an aggravation and part of his
greater plague. By such dreadful steps as these (which a wise heart will
tremble to hear) are men given to falt.

HOLINESS The only WAY to HAPPINESS.
HEB. 12.14. And Holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.


THE times in which we live are truly styled doubtful times: full of doubtful
expectations, and doubtful disputations; incerta sunt omnia.

Of doubtful expectations; there is no man looks upon himself as safe; but
different parties unite themselves, and different plots are laid, and different
interests carried on: and by this men think to be established; but men of the
strongest parts, and that have the highest power, do not many times attain
their hopes and ends; The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the
strong: because times and changes come upon all: there are changes of
condition, which the most High appointed unto all men, who rules in the
kingdoms of mortal men, which are unto them contingent, casual and unexpected;
and by this means men are made like unto a wheel; that which is now uppermost,
becomes suddenly the lowest: Summa cito fiunt ima, Eccles. 9.11. And by this
means the misery of man, by reason of this uncertainty is great upon him, that
he eats his meat in darkness, and his heart takes no rest in the night: seeing
this is the state of things, my aim is to put you upon that which is the only
security: Nulla satis magna securitas dum periclitatur aeternitas, there is no
security unto any man, whilst his eternity is in danger: therefore secure
eternity, and you secure all; its only holiness that's the way to see the Lord,
and will surely attain that end, and thereby make us everlastingly happy.

And our times are doubfull, because of doubtful dispu atations; it is with us
as the Apostle speaks, 1 Cor. 14.26. Every one has his Psalm, his Doctrine, his
Revelation, his Interpretation: and by this means their minds are busied, and
their judgments puzzled, whilst their fancies are stupefied with some novel and
unpractical curiosity; and so whilst men spend their whole strength about
Mint, Annice and Comin, the great and the weighty things of the Law are
neglected: therefore my aim is to call you off: Ne diversitas praeceptorum
rectum iter impediat. Lactan.
Lactan. The way to eternal life is not in curious disputations, but in a holy
walking: in absoluto and facili stat aeternitas: Hilar.
as Hilary says: therefore let us all pitch upon that in which all concur, and
which all must grant, that it is holiness only that is the way to happiness:
and that without holiness, no man shall ever see the Lord.

Here are two things to be opened.

First, what this holiness is which the Text speaks of, without which no man
shall see the Lord.

Secondly, what it is to see the Lord, and what this vision of God is, that's
here spoken of.

First, what holiness is, (...), without which, etc. holiness in the creature,
as well as truth, is, Conformitas cum Archetypo: as there is a principle from
which it is derived, so there is a nature unto which it is conformed: and in
this conformity holiness does consist.

There is a twofold holiness.

1. There is a legal holiness, which was a perfect conformity in heart and life
unto the will and holiness of God manifested in his Law: and this was the
holiness that was in Adam in his innocence, and is the holiness that is now to
be seen in the holy Angels in glory: an exact and perfect conformity unto the
will of God, as manifested to them, or to be manifested: for they were
conformable unto the will of God in revelatis and inrevelandis: This holiness,
as it was immediately derived from God without a Mediator, so it was perfect:
they knew the will of God perfectly, and had in them a principle of perfect
conformity thereunto: but if this be the holiness here spoken of, no man shall
ever see the Lord: for by one man sin entered into the world; this holiness was
lost in Adam. Greg. Prosper. p. 349. Omnes queal Adam perdid^t, perdiderunt.
Totum genus humanum in radice stat. There is therefore an Evangelical
holiness, which is not barely a conformity unto the will of God in his law, but
also unto the image of God in his Son as Mediator; he is the principle from
which our holiness is derived: it is from his fullness: and he is the pattern
unto which it is to be conformed: for Romans 8.29. He has predestined us to be
conformable unto the image of his Son: so that the holiness now required, is
the Law written in the heart: its not a conformity to the Law immediately, but
as the Law of the spirit of life is found in Jesus Christ: and its not derived
from God immediately: for we can, being fallen, receive nothing from him but by a
Mediator: and its not a perfect conformity in all things unto Christ:
sincerity is Gospel perfection; a full conformity we expect and pray for, and
tend to, that we may be like him, but that we shall never attain till we shall
see him as he is. So that the holiness that's here spoken of, is a sincere
conformity to the Image of God, and of the Law that is to be found in Jesus the
Mediator, though it be here but in part, and but begun, and shall never be
perfect till we see God: yet this is the holiness that will bring us to that
vision, and without which no man shall see him.

Secondly, What is it to see God? Some expound this of Christ; it is (...).
Christ is made of the Father Lord and Christ. For the Learned do make the word
to be of the same extent with Adonai in the Hebrew, which they do generally
interpret of Christ. Par. Christi visionem videtur Sanctis promittere.
Adonai dominationem denotat, and plane filio congruit, per quem Deus pater ut
fecit mundum, sic mundum moderatur. And. Masius.
Andr. Masius in Josh. 7. There shall be vision of Christ in glory: and in the
vision of him, and full communion with him, our holiness shall consist, 1 John
3.3. When he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is:
Austin.
it was Austins wish to have seen Christum in carne: if it were so desirable to
have seen Christ in the flesh, in his humbled estate, how much more desirable
to see him in his glorified: to see the King in his glory: Christ glorified,
and our selves as partaking with him in the same glory? for we shall enter into
our Masters Joy: Enter into the Joy of our Lord. That as he sat down with the
Father upon his Throne, so we should sit with him upon his throne: and this was
the happiness that Job expected, I know that my Redeemer lives, and that I
shall see him with these eyes: or else we may understand it of the vision of
God: for it is that only that is the beatifical vision, for God being the
ultimate object of our faith, Christ is but the intermediate object: through
Christ we believe in God: he must be the ultimate object of our happiness, and
so to See is an Hebraeism, and implies both vision and fru^tion: in vision; for
to know a thing in the most perfect way, is called seeing in the Scripture, 1
Pet. 1.12. The Angels desire to look into: that is, to have a through and a
perfect knowledge of them; and it implies fruition, Isa. 53.11. He shall see of
the travel of his soul and be satisfied, Isa. 66.14. Ye shall see and your
hearts shall rejoice (that is) of this you shall have experience; and so to see
the Kingdom of God, is to possess it, to enjoy it, to have a part and a portion
in it, etc. And this vision of God is double: First fiducial, which is by faith
here, for every believer must be first a Seer, John 6.40. He that sees the son
and believes in him. So Mat. 5.8. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall
see God, Heb. 11.27. He seeing him that was invisible. This is a fiducial
vision; and the truth is, without holiness no man can thus see God; But that I
shall not restrain the text to: Secondly, beatifical, that is, to see God
immediately, and that with such a perfect vision as the creature is capable of:
First to see God as he is in himself. Secondly to see God as he is in your
selves: for our happiness consists in both these: first to see God as he is in
himself, for, we shall see him as he is: this is called seeing him face to
face: here we see God but by Negatives, via negationis, as he is not, denying
unto God the imperfections you see in the creature: I say, this is rather to
see him as he is not, then as he is: and by shadows and resemblances from the
creatures, via causalitatis; and neither of these is to see God as he is, but
rather what God is not, but as he is pleased to represent himself unto our
faith, its by way of reflection not intuition: But we shall see him then as he
is: that is, by these helps and means, and through this glass no more, but
immediately face to face; it is true that the infiniteness of the divine
nature, no created understanding is able to comprehend: none can know God to
perfection but God himself: No not the Angels in Heaven: nor the man Christ
Jesus; but yet all the Saints shall know God, and see him unto their
perfection, so as to make themselves perfectly happy, though they can never
know him to his perfection: for even a glorified understanding shall be finite,
and that cannot be capable of an infinite object; we shall see him, etc. that
is infinite: but not modo infinito: and this is that which is commonly called
beatitudo objectiva, blessedness in the object: Secondly, there is a seeing of
God in themselves, when the Saints shall see such a perfect image of the glory
of God stamped upon them, that they shall see more of God manifested in
themselves of all his Attributes, then they can see in the best of the
creatures here below: more then in all the works of creation and providence
beside: some weak appearances there are of the divine nature revealed in the
Saints here: but then they shall be full and glorious; they shall shine as the
Sun in the Kingdom of my Father: there shall be more of the glory of God stamped
upon their souls and bodies then there is brightness in the Sun; and this is
another thing wherein the happiness of the Saints shall consist; the perfection
of the image of God in themselves; and this is commonly called beatitudo
formalis: to see God in themselves, and to see God in himself: in this does the
fruition of God consist: and the happiness of the creature for ever: and
holiness is the means to attain to this vision: there is no salvation without
it: it is only the holy man shall see God: and they that think to attain it any
other way, deceive themselves: for the expression is exclusive; No man, be he
what he will be; of what estate and condition soever, high or low, rich or
poor; be his authority never so great; be his profession never so glorious: let
him make never so fair a show amongst men; let him be of never so great fame
and repute, let him be never so just amongst men, and of a moral carriage and a
good behavior, that no man can blemish him; yet is he a holy man? if there be
no holiness in him, there is no vision of God for him: he can never see God by
a vision of faith here, neither shall he ever see him (that is) enjoy him in a
vision of glory hereafter; here there are great shows of holiness and shadows
which are not so, that men do count holiness; and many are cried up for Saints
in their generation: or (as is the foolery of this age) because other men will
not, they will canonize themselves for Saints: but there is a holiness of truth
that the Apostle speaks of, Ephesians. 4. and such a holiness it must be, not in name
only, but in truth, not in word, but in power; and it is observable that the
Apostle here makes it exclusive, but only to the last particle; he exhorts you
to follow peace and holiness, but he adds (...), without which there may be a
seeing of God without peace (that is) a man may follow peace and not attain it,
and yet see God, but without holiness none can see him; it is commonly by
Interpreters restrained unto the vision of God in glory, and therefore so I
shall consider it only at this time, and the observation that it does give us,
is this:

Doctrine.
Holiness is the only way to happiness: there is no seeing of God in glory
without it; none shall see God but the holy man: And here for the right
understanding of it, we are to consider holiness three ways.

First quoad principium, according unto the principle of it, and that is
Regeneration, when the seeds of holiness (that is) holy principles are sown, a
new image is begun:

Secondly, quoad incrementum, according to the increase of it: which is
sanctification, by which he that is new born to God grows up to the perfection
of those habits received in the fear of God:

Thirdly, quoad exercitium, for the putting forth of those inward improved
principles in a way of holy walking: and this is in Scripture called obedience:
without holiness in all these, suitable to the time and means that God does
vouchsafe man in a measure of truth and sincerity, there is no hope to see the
Lord.

First Holiness quoad principium, which is commonly called regeneration, and
without this there is no salvation, John 3.3. Jesus said, verily verily, etc.
except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God; we have first the
manner of the assertion: first, nota dignitatis, there is no truth but is a
beam from the father of light; but there are some truths more precious and of
greater worth then others. Secondly, not a certitudinis, all his words are
true, yet he does set a special impress of truth for to be observed upon some
words more then upon others:

Secondly, the thing asserted, except a man be born from above, non unius
partis correctionem, sed totius naturae renovationem designat. Calvin.
Calv. It Is not the understanding is blind, Labor to get it illightned: the
morals are ill, Labor to reform them: it is not the change of a man's way, or
his leaving some sins, and taking up the practice of some duties, but it must
be A new nature; as if he were new born into the world, 2 Cor. 5.17. thou must
have a divine nature: a new creature, there is nothing of the old building will
serve, all things must become new: it is called therefore, the new creation of
God.

Thirdly, the universality of the assertion, aequivalet universali: what age,
or calling, or condition soever, though this man were one that lived in the
Church, a Pharisee, civil in his Conversation, a Saint in his generation, he
was a man that had attained a more then ordinary pitch of knowledge, a teacher,
and of a good disposition, a man not bitter against Christ, as the rest of his
sect were, and yet Christ says to him, he must be born again: a man may be a
member of a Church, of a loving and ingenuous disposition, a fair and
unblamable conversation, and a man of that eminency in knowledge that he may be
a teacher of others, and yet this man must be born again, or he cannot see the
Kingdom of God.

Fourthly, the necessity he puts upon it also; the Kingdom of God is both the
Kingdom of grace here, and hereafter of glory; and to see it, is frui to enjoy
it, participem fieri, as ver. 5. he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God; so
that to see it, is to enter into, or to have a man's own part and portion in it,
with the rest of the Saints; so that let a man be never so great in the world,
never so eminent for profession, let his outward carriage be never so upright,
nay, Angelical, yet if he has no birth but his first birth, he is not in Gods
account a member of this Kingdom of grace, nor has any right to the
privileges of it here, or of the Kingdom of glory hereafter: he has no part
or portion therein. There are two parables by which Christ does hold this forth
to us clearly: first that of the marriage of the Kings son, Matthew. 22. there is
a guest that comes without a wedding garment, it is not a slight thing to come
to the ordinances in the Gospel in an unregenerate state; if there be but one,
the King will come in to see the guests; this wedding garment is -- Christ put
on by faith, in a work of vocation: and the image of Christ begins in a man in
the work of regeneration: and he shall be cast out from the wedding, that is so
in the day when the Lord shall come and visit the guests: so that parable of
the foolish Virgins. Math. 25.
First, Virgins they were, and kept their garments from gross pollutions.
Secondly, they were Professors, and they joined in society wih the wise.
Thirdly, in high esteem they were, for they had oil in their Lamps: they did
shine as Lights in the world. Fourthly, they held out with great expectation
unto the coming of the Lord, for they went out to meet the Bride; and yet they
were shut out when the Bridegroom came: because they had oil in their Lamps,
but none in their Vessels: the gifts of the Spirit of God are of two sorts,
some qualifying, as the Spirit is forma assistens, and works upon them in acts;
and this is oil enough to cause them to make a profession, and to shine as
Lights in the world: but some are renewing, as the Spirit is forma informans, A
spirit dwelling in the Saints, as a fountain of living Waters, springing up to
Everlasting life. Now they that had the one without the other, were shut out
with I know you not, etc. And we have one famous instance in the Scripture, and
that is of Timothy; he was born in the Church, of godly Parents, there was
faith unfeigned in his grandmother Lois, etc. he was one Religiously educated,
for he knew the Scripture from a child, and he was a child of a great deal of
forwardness, in so much that the People of God had great hopes of him; there
were many Prophesies that forespake him, that he would be an eminent and a
blessed instrument in the Church of God: Paul says, according to the Prophecy
forespoken that went of thee: and yet for all this there had been no Salvation
for Timothy, but that he was begotten by Paul through the Gospel, He is my own
son in the faith, 1 Timothy 1.2.

And the reasons of it are two;

First it is in Regeneration that a man receives a new and another spirit, 1
Cor. 2.12. We have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which
is of God. My servant Caleb has another spirit, says God, Numb 14.24. There
is a double spirit that acts all Mankind; all unregenerate men are under the
power of the devil, who is the spirit of the world: the world lies (...) 1 Ioh.
5.19. In aliquo posicum esse, est sub ejus esse potestate. Camer.
And this spirit acts and effects works in all the children of disobedience:
yea even in the elect before their conversion: before their regeneration the
strong man armed keeps the house, till a stronger then he comes: but when the
time comes that is appointed by the Father, that the soul shall be actually
given unto Christ, who was in his purpose and in his covenant given to him
before the world was, for there was grace given us in Christ before the world
began, 2 Timothy 1.9. Now he sends forth the spirit of his son into their hearts,
and he takes possession of them for the Lord: and the strong man that formerly
kept the house, is cast out: that he that was before the devils house, he is
now the Temple of the Holy ghost, and the habitation of God through the spirit:
now there are none for whom the house in heaven is prepared, but they that have
been the habitation of God here: none shall dwell with God hereafter, in whom
the Spirit did not dwell here: the same spirit, that as a spirit of holiness
dwells in them here, it is the same spirit that is in them as a spirit of
adoption and glory hereafter: therefore the great change in a man, the first
change as the first fruit of electing love, is in the receiving of another
spirit, and that is only in regeneration: then is the spirit of Christ sent
forth into the hearts of the Saints.

Secondly, in regeneration a man receives a new Principle: for by nature a man
has not in him a Principle of communion with God, or of obedience to him, Ioh
3.6. that is Christ's Reason, That which is born of the flesh is flesh: it is
wholly corrupt, and that by which the soul is no way fitted to walk with God:
therefore marvel not that I say unto you, that thou must be born again: grace
is a new creature, 2 Cor. 5.17. Ephesians. 2.10. We are created in Christ, to good
works: it is a new man, an inward man: and it is from this created infused
habit that all holy actions flow: let a man's duties be never so many, and his
outward behavior be never so Saint like, if it does not flow from a new man,
an inward man, it can no ways please God, or be accepted of him: its a Law
written in the heart, spiritually enlightening the understanding, and
effectually determining the will unto Objects spiritual and supernaturally
good: and before this be wrought in a man, there are no duties that are looked
upon as duties by him. Behold he prays, Acts 9. says the Lord to Ananias
concerning Paul: he was a Pharisee, and they were much in prayer: but it was
never looked upon and reckoned as a prayer by God, till he had a new principle,
a new man: for the Lord looks to the heart; that is, he sees actions in their
principles: men can judge of principles only by their actions: but God does
judge of actions according to the principles from whence they flow. The tree
must be good, or else to God the fruit can never be good, but as the apples of
Sodom: they must be good things that must be brought forth from an inward
Treasury. And take a godly man that is converted, when he does not stir up the
grace of God that he has received, and acts it in duty, he does perform it but
barely as a natural man; and it does not stand upon account before God as a
duty; no further then there is an exercise of the regenerate part, is any
service accepted of God; for it is the good work that is begun in us, that the
Lord will perfect, Phil. 1.6. therefore grace is a good work in us: a principle
in the soul, fitting it for service and communion; and it is this that is
ordained unto perfection in glory. If there be not a new principle, a good work
begun, never look to have it perfected in the day of the Lord.

I see I am much prevented; I shall but touch the rest.

Secondly, Let us look upon holiness quoad incrementum; and so its commonly
called in Scripture Sanctification, that is, the growth and improvement of that
seed, and those principles that were wrought in a man at his first conversion,
2 Pet. 3 18. Grow in grace. 2 Pet. 1.5. Add to your faith virtue; non quoad
habitum, sed actum and gradum; add to the acts, and thereby add to the degrees
of the habit; for acts do perfect habits: And Col. 1.12. it is not barely the
having of grace, that is required unto Salvation, but it is the growth of it,
and the improvement of it, that a man may be made meet for glory: I say, growth
in grace is a duty, that is of necessity to Salvation as well as truth in
grace, where God gives light and means; I speak not now of Infants, or such as
dye as soon as they are converted, Col. 1.12. We are made meet Inheriters with
the Satuts in light. There is a double right that the Saints have to heaven.

First, Jus haereditarium, an hereditary right, and that is at Regenration,
when they are put into Christ, and so are made Coheirs with him of his
inheritance, having grace begun in them, the same Image of God which shall be
perfected in glory, and was given as a principle ordained to such a perfection.

Secondly, Jus aptitudinarium, and that is a right of fitness, whereby we are
qualified to receive such a mercy, and that is as an heir has a right of
Inheritance in his nonage, but he has not a right of fitness till he comes to
years, and be able to manage his Estate, when he has received it: And there is
required in the Saints as well a right of fitness unto Heaven, as a right of
inheritance, without which, I may say (after a sort) they cannot be saved, and
that upon a double ground.

First, there is no grace that is ordained unto glory, but growing grace; and
if grace be true, there is a natural tendency in it unto growth: as there is in
seed that is cast into the earth; and so much the more, because they are
planted by the rivers of water: the Trees of righteousness they grow upon the
bank of the River, Ezekiel. 47.10. They shall grow as Willows, they shall grow as
Calves of the stall, Mal. 4.2. There is a great measure of growth promised unto
them: and if true grace be necessary to salvation, then growth of grace must
be; for there is no true grace but growing grace, and there is no grace that
shall come to Heaven else: I forget that which is behind, not that I have
already attained: Grace is not only donum, but depositum, and it must be
improved; it is a Talent that more must be gained by, by Trading, etc. it is a
spark from Heaven that will never cease aspiring till it be joined with the
flame of glory Eternal in the Heavens.

Secondly, there is a pitch of grace that the Lord has appointed unto his
People that they shall fill up whilst they live here, before they be
translated unto glory: there is a (...), Ephesians. 4.13. A fullness of the age of
the stature of Christ, a measure that Christ has appointed unto them, and with
which he will fill and enrich them that are the body of Christ, of which every
member is a part, and which he by the increase of his grace does fill up: which
is in this respect as it were imperfect, till the measure of his Saints be
filled, not only in suffering, Col. 1.24. but in graces also. Now the Lord
having appointed them a measure which they are all in this life to fulfill; as
he will not destroy wicked men till they have fulfilled their measure; fill up
(says Christ to the Pharisees) the measure of your fathers iniquities: so
neither will he translate the Saints, till they have fulfilled their measure,
which is done by some sooner, and some later: and when the measure is full, as
then Rev. 19. He does tread the wine press of his Fathers vengeance upon the
wicked: So when the Corn is ripe, he does put in his Sicle and reap, and
gathers it into his barn, etc. therefore Job 5.26. Thou shall come to thy grave
in a good full age, as a shock of Corn in his season: God will not reap till
his harvest be ripe; therefore the Lord has appointed a measure, and what it
is we know not; we should set no bounds to our selves, but strive unto the
uttermost, adding one degree of grace unto another: so be sure of this, till
thou attain thy measure, thou shall never be received unto glory; and therefore
unto the actual possession of grace, growth in grace is as necessary in some
respects, as truth of grace is. What is the reason that a wicked man does
commit iniquity an hundred times, and his days are prolonged? it is because he
has not filled up his measure, Joel 3.13,14. So, what is the reason that some
of the Saints are taken up betimes into Heaven, and others of the People of God
are a long time in the world? Why it is because they have not fulfilled their
measure; for the Lord would not stay a day beyond his time in the one as well
as in the other: the one is ripe for wrath, and the other is made meet for
glory.

Thirdly, look upon Holiness quoad exercitium, and so its called Obedience: and
this also is necessary to salvation; that unto men grown, strong Christians;
without the exercise of Holiness in ways of Obedience they can never see the
Lord: A man must run before he can receive the prize, 1 Cor. 9.24. And he must
fight the good fight of faith, and finish his course, before he shall receive
the Crown of righteousness, 2 Timothy 4.8. To him that overcomes I will grant to
sit upon my Throne, as I overcame, and am sat down with my Father upon his
Throne, etc. Rev. 3.21. Its called The Laborers are worthy of their hire: the
hire is for the Laborers, and for none else; Opera non sunt minus necessaria,
quam sides ipsa, Luther: Obedience and good works are in some sense as
necessary to Salvation as Faith; I say as necessary, though not in the same
kind, as the Instrument of Justification.

And there is also a double ground for it:

First, because there is a measure of Obedience which the Lord has appointed
unto all the Saints before they shall be translated; it shall not be till their
Obedience is fulfilled, 2 Cor. 10.6. as men shall not take them away, The
Witnesses shall not be slain till they have finished their testimony, Rev. 11.
So God will not take them away till they have finished their course, Joh. 17.2.
says Christ, Father, I have glorified thee on earth, I have finished the work
that thou gave me to do: and a Saint shall not be taken from hence till he be
perfected: I work to day, and to morrow, and the third day I shall be
perfected: that is, in respect of the work that was given him to do: and the
perfection of the service, is the perfection of the man: the same is true of
all the Saints, when they have brought forth their uttermost fruit unto God,
and their work is ended, they shall never till then be translated.

Secondly, all men that are received into glory, they are received unto the
degrees of glory unto which they are appointed; and though its true, that by
Conversion they are put into a right of glory; but degrees of glory are
answerable unto degrees of service which men are in this life drawn forth for:
though God will not reward men for their works, as if they were the meritorious
cause; yet he will for degrees reward them according unto their works; and so
good works are a good foundation, by which men lay hold of eternal life, 1 Timothy
6.19. As Christ has upon his head many Crowns, suitable to the multitude of his
Victories, Rev. 19.7.

Amongst the Romans there was a common Crown, and some Crowns that were more
special and peculiar; Corona Civica, and Navalis, etc. So there is a common
Crown too belongs to the Saints, as they are in Christ, and so enter into their
Masters joy; but there are some peculiar Crowns, which belong unto some more
then to others, answerable to the special services that they have performed
upon Earth: As the Apostles shall sit upon twelve Thrones, judging the twelve
Tribes of Israel: There are stars primae magnitudinis, though all the righteous
shall shine as the stars; yet it is observed by our Divines in the Angels
themselves, that though there be no difference betwixt them in natura Angelica;
the Angelical nature is alike in all: Yet in of ficio, in office, there is a
great deal of difference in the glory of the Angels, as the Lord does employ
them, some in more high and excellent services then others; and answerable to
that shall their reward be; the essential glory shall be all alike: but there is
an additional glory that shall be made out unto them answerable unto the
services that they have performed; therefore its true of holiness in this large
extent of it, That without it no man shall see the Lord.

There is but one Use I will make of it, which is of mavelous concernment
unto every one of you.

Use.
The Use shall be of Examination; prove your selves, for without holiness there
is no salvation; it is that in which men are apt to deceive their own souls,
Job 34.30. (...) an hypocrite: that the hypocrite reign not, least the people
be ensnared; the word signifies nubilus, a man in a cloud, or velatus pallio,
Aven.
Av^ a man that covers himself with a cloa^; men find out oftentimes
artificial coverings for themselves, and thereby deceive their own souls: it is
not holding some opinions in matters of Religion, or going zealously with some
one party; its not barely appearing for truth, for thou may do all this and
be unholy, a worker of iniquity, and if so, there is no vision of God for thee:
But how shall a man know whether or no he be holy according to the sense of the
Gospel? I will give you six rules briefly. I beseech you carry the^ home with
you, and the Lord carry them to your hearts.

First, a man that i; truly holy according to the sense of the Gospel, is truly
affected with the honor and dishonor of God: for holiness exalts God. I say,
holiness exalts God; in Joshua 7.9. Israel had fallen before the men of At
their enemies; what is it now that troubles Joshuah most? Israel flies before
their enemies; Lord, what will thou do for thy great name? truly, though we
should perish, and our names be rooted out from under heaven, our names rot in
the earth, it were no great matter; but thy name, Lord, says he, I am not able
to bear the thought of it, what will thou do to thy great name? so likewise
David, The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me; he could
have born any thing better, then that God should have been dishonored; my cyes
gush out with Rivers of water, because men keep not thy Law; malo in nos murmur
hominum quam in Deum, Bernard.
I remember it is Bernards expression; rather says he, let men vent their
displeasure against us then against God: bonum est mihi si dignetur Deus me uti
pro clypeo: if the Lord would please to make use of me to keep off reproaches,
and injuries from himself, it would be satisfaction enough to me; let my name
be blotted never so much, if Gods name be not spotted: if his name be not
profaned, it is enough: Now if I should put you to examine your hearts by this:
Is Gods glory dear to you, and do you say, profaned be my name, so as Gods name
be honored; is there nothing better to you in this world like to this? my
conscience answers in the presence of God to such a question as this: Truly (my
Brethren) I am afraid few of you can say in truth, that the Lord is thus
exalted in your souls; how is it that the dishonors done to God, either we make
matter of scoff, or otherwise it does but draw out our envies, and invectives,
but it is not matter of drooping continually upon our Spirits: there are few
Ages that you shall read of, wherein the name of God has been higher, in a
more impudent way dishonored, then in this Age, (I may say it with boldness)
with more open face, a Whores forehead that cannot blush; and yet
notwithstanding, where be the morners in Sion? where be those that do say, My
estate does me no good, and my honor does me no good, nor never will while I
enjoy it without God, while I see God dishonored? Well, certainly, suitable to
the measure of holiness that is in any man, so will his affections be to the
honor of God; and where this affection is not in truth, there is no holiness in
truth. This is the first thing.

The second sign that I shall give you to examine your selves by, is this.
Where holiness is in truth, there the heart is mightily affected unto the truth
of God, which is the foundation of boliness; sanctify them by thy truth: it is
the expression in Joh. 17. then Truth is the foundation of sanctification:
whenever holiness is in truth, then the man is mightily affected to truth:
and I do reu^ember it was an excellent rule that Virenencius gave long ago,
Virenenc.
quo quis sanctior, co promptior novellis contraire: the more holy any man is,
says he, the more his heart goes against all humane inventions, contrary to
the truths of God. Why now, should I put you upon the trial by this; have not
you all Truths corrupt, even to the very foundation? those in this City, that
dispute whether there be a God or no, to the very foundation: that deny the
Godhead of Christ, and of the Spirit: deny the truth of the Scriptures: why
now, how I pray you does this sit upon your spirits? how are you affected with
truth? for truth is the mother of holiness; and I say unto you, it will bear a
child-like affection thereunto: my Brethren, will you give me leave a little to
speak plainly to you; the great design that Satan has (I conceive) in this
present age; the great design (for he has many) but I say, the Great design, I
look upon to be this: So to dispute all things, as that in matters of Religion
men might look upon nothing as certain: dispute all things, that so you may be
certain of nothing: for this has been the great business: and truly I must
(though some of them go under the name of Saints) I must say, they are highly
the instruments of the Devil in it: I fay, the great business of these latter
years has been this, it has been to dispute principles, and overthrow
foundations. Augustine.
Augustine says, there are two ways by which the Devil draws men from Christ:
one in a time of peace: and another in a time of persecution: in a time of
persecution, coget homines negare Christum, he compels men to deny Christ, in
the time of persecution: But in the time of prosperity, docet, he teaches men
then to deny Christ, he finds out such Doctrines as shall teach men handsomely
to deny Christ, and to defend it when he has done; O my Brethren, how does
this sit upon your Spirits? It was Luthers saying, Luther.
Spiritus sanctus Scepticus non est, the holy Spirit is not a Skeptical Spirit,
there is little of that Spirit in this Land; Christianism is turned to
Sceptism, question every thing, and dispute every thing; and men look upon it
as a great piece of Religion, to maintain that there is no certainty in
Religion; and truly this is the way of the wise men of our times: Why, now
consider two things are added hereunto. One is to prosecute this design, the
Ministry must first be undervalued, that by that means there may be way made
that they may be suppressed; for while these men live, they do say in their own
bosoms so much as Saul did of David to Jonathan, while the son of Iesse lives,
says he, thy Kingdom will never be established: they do say so, that these new
ways of Religion will never be established, so long as some of these men
continue: they do say, that this is the Heir, let us kill him, and the
inheritance will be ours; we shall never be the great Preachers till then; nor
our lights, and opinions will never be entertained for Gospel till then; for so
what was the advice of Consenus the Jesuit a great while ago; and truly this
is the very truth; for as it is justly to be feared you have a great many among
you, so those that are acted among you, are acted very much by a Jesuitical
principle; and what was his advice? he wishes them by all means to take away
the Ministry; but says, do it not all at once, but take away some first, and
disgrace the rest: and so by that means a way will be mace that you may lay
them aside when you will; and he gives them his reason for it; take away those
that are able to maintain those Doctrines once, and then the Doctrines will
fall of themselves: Haeresis (for so he calls the truth) cui patrocinium decrit,
sine pugna concidet: alas, take a poor upstart fellow now, that looks upon
himself as a great Preacher, understanding not what he says, it is an easy
matter to make this man leave this truth, or that truth; but take another man
that is able to assert it: and alas, before such a man these men dare not
appear: and therefore I say, that these Doctrines they cry down will never
fall, so long as they live to maintain them, therefore down with them.

Another way that is effectual to further this great design is this, which you
cannot but see: who must be embraced, countenanced: I wish it be not so with
those in authority here among you, I wish it be not so; who must be received as
the men of their Council, entertained at their table, why, who must they be?
truly, such as do maintain some abominable Doctrine in matters of Religion:
that by this means such men being countenanced by men in place and authority,
truly their ware may vent the better; that is the way I say, the ware may vent
the better: and whereas, oh that the Lord would be pleased but to let men
consider that in the 2 Ep. of John v. 10. He that brings not this Doctrine,
receive him not into your houses, bid him not God speed: have no converse, no
communion with him; there is not so much as common civility to be showed to
him; a stranger you are to take in, but an heretic you are not. Now I entreat
you to consider seriously with your selves; if truth be the mother of holiness,
and you see truth is so much in danger, and so much laid at, and the great
designs of the times run this way, how are your hearts affected with it?
Certainly, if thou have holiness in truth, thou will be mightily affected with
truth that is the mother of holiness. This is a second Rule. There are two or
three more; but I am very fearful of trespassing upon you.

One is; where there is holiness in truth, that man is affected with spiritual
sins: that man is most affected with spiritual sins: you shall find the Apostle
says, Cleanse your selves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit: that is the
aim of the holy man, the Godly man, in 2 Cor. 7.1. but the great thing that
does affect his soul, is spiritual sins; that which no eye takes notice of, but
the eye of God only; so you shall find in Psalm 42.11. there the base dejection
of spirit, how David is troubled at i^; why art thou cast down O my soul? so
likewise carnal confidence; in Psalm. 80.7. he says, I saidthon have made my
mountain to stand strong: grudging at the prosperity of the wicked; so foolish
was I, and ignorant, I was as a Beast before thee: all my ways are brutish; I
am more brutish then any man. Paul the rebellion to the Law that was in his
members. Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart: thus the people
of God, they are more affected with spiritual sins committed in the eye of God,
then they are in reference unto outward sins committed before the eyes of men:
they are more ashamed before God, then they can be before men. Mr. Bradford,
though he were a man had attained to a great measure of holiness, that Doctor
Tailor calls him, That Saint of God John Bradford, yet how does he bewail his
hypocrisy!

Now do you examine your hearts by thy:if you be holy, you be not affected only
with sins before men, but that which sits sadliest upon your spirits, is,
that your hearts are defiled before God: you are more ashamed before him, then
you are before all the men in the world. That is a third Rule, which I do but
name.

Secondly, where there is holiness in truth, there the man sets before him as
his mark, the most difficult duties in Religion: he does not take up the
easiest dut ies; but I say, though he fall short in performance many times, yet
he sets before him as a mark to aim at, the most difficult duties of Religion.
I press hard to the mark, says Paul; a mark of an enlightened understanding
which I conceive as well as that goal of glory: now as there are in the
cripture some things that are (...), hard to be understood, as the Apostle
says: so there are some duties too in Scripture that are (...), hard to be put
in practice, very hard: now the holy man, he has an eye unto the most
difficult duties in Religion; for he knows that all these lie upon him as
duties, and he sets them before him as a mark that he aims at; and I will name
some of them to you, that I may draw to a conclusion.

As first: It is a hard thing, and yet a duty, to have a man's obedience at
highest, when his comforts are at lowest: it was one of the great difficulties
that Luther found; Luther.
there were three things he found very hard, he professed, in Religion. One
was, to believe that which was impossible: and another was, to hope for that
which was delayed: and another was: to love God when God showed himself an
enemy, says he, that my obedience should be highest when my comforts are at
lowest ebb: for a man to obey his voice, and serve him, and yet all the while
to walk in darkness, and have no light; as it is in Isa. 50.10. truly my
Brethren, this is a hard thing to say, I will love him though he kill me: I
will trust in him though he kill me: this you will say is a hard duty: O, such
things as these now, the holy man has in his eyes, these are the marks he sets
himself to aim at.

Secondly, for a man's soul to be lowest when his employment is highest: for a
man to be like a Spire-Steeple, minimus in summo, to have his spirit lowest
when his employment is at the highest; it was so with Paul, in the 1 Cor.
15.10. I have labored more abundantly then they all: chiefest in service, the
greatest of servants, but the least of Saints, the least of Saints: why this is
a hard thing: O, we do find, there is not a poor creature employed in a
business, if he be honored above his Brethren, but presently how does his
spirit rise with his employment! he grows so proud presently, the earth cannot
bear him: we see examples of it every day: but here is holiness, my Brethren,
that sets him this pattern, his spirit to be low, when his employment is high.

Thirdly, holiness sets a man this pattern, to be contented with the things
that are present; that is the Apostles exhortation, Heb. 13.5. be contented
with things that are present, or be sufficient with them: let the things that
are present be sufficient to thee: whether I have much or little, honor or
disgrace, it is that that is present: Now for a man to subscribe to the dealing
of God, and to lay his hand upon his mouth, and to say, This is the disposing
of a wise Father, it is but in viaticum, it is not in praemium, it is but for
my passage, it is not for my reward: then I say for a man to say truly,
Whatsoever I have here, if it be but enough to land me sase in an other world,
it is all I care for: O my Brethren, this is the pitch that the Saints of God
now set to themselves: where there is holiness, I say, these difficult duties
the soul propounds unto itself. But,

Further yet, Where there is holiness, it propounds this, To look upon
suffering as a gift: in Phil. 1.29. to you it is given, not only to believe,
but to suffer for the name of the Lord Jesus. Men can look upon employment as a
gift sometimes, if God will set them in honorable service: O but to look upon
sufferings as honorable, as if a man by that were to fill up that which is
behind of the sufferings of Christ: this is that pitch which the Saints set to
themselves: the mark they aim at, is such difficult duties as these are, to
look upon suffering as a gift, to say as in Jam. 1.9. Let the brother of low
degree rejoice that he is exalied; I, there is reason for that; I, but shall
the brother of high degree rejoice that he is made low? Yes, that God has
called thee to any condition to do good: O that is a spiritual heart indeed,
that is a holy heart indeed.

Besides, there is yet another great truth, and that is, to have such a spirit,
willing to go alone in duties, and not to be turned out of the way: that if I
am brought to duty, though I am left alone, yet notwithstanding the duty is
mine, the special assistance is Gods. Man is a sociable Creature indeed, and he
is in a great measure like a drop emptyed into the Sea, he is mightily apt to
swim down with the tide: O it is a hard matter for a man to be willing in duty to
go alone: yet so it was with Paul. At my first Answer all men for sook me, no
man stood by me: for a man to say, One God is sufficient, as Mr Calvin I
remember has it upon Zach. 9.12. Go to the strong holds ye prisoners of hope.
Strong holds! they had no strong hold, the City was burnt, and the Temple
destroyed, and they had no strong hold to betake themselves to, turn to your
strong holds: Satis praesidii in uno Deo: but yet notwithstanding says he,
there was succor enough in one God. So says the soul, There is society and
communion enough in one God: if no man stand by me in duty, yet notwithstanding
the Lord will: for a man to go alone, and not to balk nor to be turned out of
the way, because he is deserted by men, either by a principle of falsehood or
Cowardice: truly this is one of the difficultest duties of Religion.

There is one thing more (I see I must break off) I will but name this one
thing; and that is, To have a man's spirit raised by opposition, that the more
he does meet with opposition, in a way of duty, the more resolute he is for it:
so far is he from being afraid of the threatenings of men, of the frowns of men,
he shall lose this man's favor, incur such a man's displeasure, and lose such an
advantage and opportunity: no, his spirit rises far more for it: it is with
such a man as it is with the fire in winter: the fire burns the hotter because
of the coldness of the air; so it is with such a soul that is truly inflamed.
Come to David and tell him, O there is a Goliath, and he is come out with a
spear like a Weavers beam, and there is one that bears his target goes before
him; where is he? says David: I will fight with him, says he; his spirit does
not fall by difficulties, but rises: I am not afraid of any uncircumcised
Philistim; my Brethren, this is a true noble spirit; holy greatness of mind
lies in this; when a man's spirit is born up upon the greatness of his God, and
the goodness of his Cause: it is a base spirit that is born up by the strength
of his party, I have so many men on my side; alas my Brethren, that is a base
spirit; but I say, here is a true noble spirit, the greatness of his God, and
the goodness of his Cause: and if that will not bear me out, says the soul,
let me sink in it, I am content to perish. I remember a godly man; the Lord,
says he, will make Jeremiahs face like an Adamant: says he, like an Adamant,
the hardest of stones? truly then let the storm come, and the Adamant that
shrinks not, it fears not, it changes not its hue: no not a jot, the Adamant
is the same. Certainly, my Beloved, this is the Motio of every truly noble
spirit; Nec spe, nec timore, it is neither hope, nor fear that acts me; I can
neither hope for any thing, ne there truly am I afraid of any thing that man can
do unto me; and he does neither fear, nor faint, nor fly, but the more
difficulties rise, the more does his spirit rise: I say grounded upon the
greatness of his God, and the goodness of his cause; Now it ye be holy men, you
do not pick and choose duties, but the more difficult duties are, the more you
strive to rise to bring up your spirits to them; I that is holiness, not to
bring down the duty to you, but to keep up the Law, as Paul says, the Law is
holy, and just, and good; only labor you to bring up your spirits to the rule
of it. If you are holy men now, it will be thus with you.

Thirdly, a holy man hates every false way, and fears it, and recovers out of
it, Psalm. 119.128. Romans 12.9. the word is (...), its to hate it as Hell it
self. Secondly, he fears it, Eccl. 9.2. he that fears an oath, etc. I fear
nothing but sin, says the holy man. Thridly, he recovers himself; he does not
lie in his sin; Peter sinned, but Peter sorrowed for his sin; a good man is a
living fountain, will never be drawn dry; grace is a living principle, it does
work out the mudd in the heart by degrees, as the Sun does labor for some time
with the mist, but dispels it at the last, the longer any man lies in sin after
a fall, the more unholy his heart is; to sin presently after duty, is a sign
there has been little communion with God in the duty: and to rise presently
after sin, is a sign that God has hold on the man, and that the root of the
matter is in him.

Fourthly, try it by this, if you hate your own iniquity, if that be your great
care, Psalm. 18.23. Ezech. 7.19. they shall not satisfy their souls because it
is the slumbling block of their iniquity, etc. 13. neither shall any strengthen
himself in the iniquity of his life; that is, the whole comfort and delight of
their lives does come in by it: it is all the pleasure and the joy they have;
men looking upon the vanity of the world, every man has his Treasure something
that he does choose to himself, either in his age, Psalm. 119.9. or in his
calling, or in his acquaintance, in his custom; and if ever a man do meet with
an opportunity of temptation (...), it is then; he is to take heed to himself,
as the exhortation is in Luke 8.13. you have been Conquerers, take heed now you
be not overcome with the Devil: and you have fought for liberty, take heed you
be not the worst of slaves, as that man is that is a servant to his lust: You
have asserted the liberty of others, maintain your own liberty also, and be not
the servants to sin.

Fifthly, if you be holy, you will have respect unto all the commandments,
Psalm. 119.6. he that does despise any one Commandment, makes conscience of
none; it is universality that is the great note of sincerity; now to live in
the willing neglect of any known duty, and the Law of God comes in against a
man, and the man is afraid to hear of such a duty, because his guilt arises,
and his trouble is renewed thereby, and therefore the man would shift it off,
and would disburden himself of the sens of it; surely then that soul has cause
to fear, holiness is not his aim: but now when the commandment comes, and the
man is a co-worker with God as it were, and is willing it should be set on upon
his soul, and is not willing to give himself a dispensation from it, but he
says, I must walk up to the extremity of the rule, and observe it to the
uttermost extent of it, for I must be Judged by it, God will lay Judgment to
the line, etc. this is the sense of a holy heart.

Sixthly, if you are holy, your holiness will answer the Law of God; for it is
the Law written in the heart, that you must come up to; you have obeyed from
the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered to you; we are cast into
it, as into a mold, and therefore it must be a perfect form; there are the
great things of the Law, Romans 11.17. Heb. 13.8,9. and it was the sin of the
Pharisees that they only regarded lesser things, and left the great things of
the Law undone: and its the great sin of hypocrites whether it be in point of
sin, or in point of duty, to be only zealous against lesser things: therefore
try your selves by these rules, for it is a matter of the greatest concernment
of your lives, etc.

By these may you know if you are in the way to the Beatifical vision; by these
may you judge of your holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.

Babylons utter ruin, THE SAINTS Triumph.
At a Thanksgiving for the victory of Ireland, against the Irish, Aug. 29.
1649.
REVEL. 18.2. Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, etc.


THE great works of the Saints in this life, are to believe Gods promises, and
to serve his providence, and reflect his praises; and it is the great thing
that God does expect as the fruit of all his mavelous works, that when his
works do praise him (that is) give matter of praise, his Saints should bless
him, Psalm. 145.10. and for this cause there are three titles given unto the
Saints in the Scripture.

First, they are said to be (...) those that take delight in the works of the
Lord: they being all of them wonderful and glorious, and only to be admired:
whereas other men only study the works of men, and be taken with them, but they
only take pleasure in studying the works of God.

Secondly, they are called (...) taking pleasure in them, they study them and
search into them, that they may find out all the excellency and glory that is
in them; which at first sight no man is able to find out, Psalm 111.2.

Thirdly, they are called, (...) the Lords Recorders, Isa. 62.6. they received
the promises of God, and their accomplishment; and of these things the hearts
of the Saints are a faithful Register; his mercies are written in their hearts
as well as his Laws: the one that they may serve him; and the other that they
may rejoice in him.

Now you that have pleasure in the works of God, ye are come before the Lord
this day to enter an eminent National mercy upon public record; and if ye
search into it, after a diligent scrutiny ye will find there are these six
things specially to be observed therein.

First; it is a return not only of late, but of ancient prayers: It is one of
the great Questions that the Saints of God have as matter to dispute in all the
mercies that they receive, whether they have them as effects of providence, or
as the heirs of the promise: whether they have of them only a jus Politicum, or
Evangelicum? the one indeed non fundatur in Gratia; but the other is: now if it
be given in answer to prayers, it is a birth of the promise, which the prayers
of the Saints help to deliver, Isa. 37.3. but specially when mercies have been
long delayed, and the answers of prayers have been long deserr'd: when Abraham
had prayed for a child twenty years then to have the promise speak: and when
thechildren of Israel had prayed 70. year, then when they were even out of
hopes, and gave their prayers for lost, now to be answered in them, made them
to be like them that dream; to recover an old debt, and to receive a ship safe
home and richly laden that has been long at Sea, and we know not what was
become of it, it comes home with the greater joy: Why does the Lord delay the
answers of the prayers of his people? not that he does not intend to grant
them; for Bernard, Bernard.
Priusquam engr^ssa est oratto ex ore tuo, ipse scribi jubet in libro suo.

But he does wait to be gracious. Now delaying of the mercy does raise the
price of it; now ye come to reap of the harvest of many of your prayers that
are past and gone, that you even now gave for lost: there is a twofold joy that
the Scripture speaks of as transcendent; the joy of harvest, and the joy of
soldiers when they divide the spoil: and truly there is matter of both these
joys in this mercy administered to you; for you divide the spoil of the enemy,
and with all you reap to your selves the harvest of all your former prayers and
petitions: Oh how did the pulpits in times past sound with such words as these,
Lord, remember bleeding and dying Ireland; Lord, this is Ireland that is a
cast-out people, hat none cares for; but when thou make inquisition for blood
remember them, etc. and those prayers which were put up from many a gracious
heart, which are now answered, though now many of them happily are displeased and
discontented with the return of their own prayers.

Secondly, it is a mercy given in when all things were desperate, and even all
hope of a deliverance was gone: Now is God a help found in the needful time of
trouble: when the enemies power and confidence was high, and they said Ireland
is our own: we will pursue them, even take them and satisfy our lusts upon
them: we will surely root out the English name from amongst us, and we will try
if they can swim into England: it may be their faith will bear them up, as that
party has always scoffed at godliness in all their successes; but be no more
mockers least your bonds increase.

Now when you had not an Army in the field, the whole Kingdom was their own,
and not a Garrison left in the whole Kingdom but one and that brought to the
very brink of destruction also, and must have been surrendered speedily after
they made their approaches to it; Now God gives in the mercy, now does the Lord
judge his people, and repent him concerning his servants: when he sees that
their power is gone, and that there is none shut up or left, Deuteronomy 32.36. when
there is no Army in the field, no soldiers in garrison: now is the time that
the Lord does appear, and take to himself his great power and reign.

Thirdly, when the Lord does therein exceed the expectations of his servants; a
deliverance they hoped for, but not so great, not so sudden, so that when it
came they seemed as men that dream, and they can scarce believe that God would
do so great things for them, when the Lord is come to do them: when the son of
man comes, shall he find faith upon earth? its a faith in reference to the
coming of Christ for to take vengeance on the Churches adversaries, Isa. 64.3.
thou did great things for us which we looked not for; for God does not answer
prayers according unto our hopes, but according to his own mercies; as he does
not reward our services according to the measure of our duty, but in the mouth
of mercy, Hos. 10.12. a man does sow in duty, but he does reap -- in ore --
misericordiae.

Fourthly, when it is by the hand of those whom they have oppressed; when the
witnesses that were slain shall rise again, and they shall destroy their
persecutors by the sword that comes out of their mouths, then it is the
greater mercy, and far the greater confusion unto the enemy; Isa. 41.15. When
the worm Jacob shall thresh the mountains, and when the arm of the Lord should
be made bare in it, and his hand more immediately seen, beyond the purpose,
courage and intention of men, they are engaged before they are aware, and
victory is won before they know they are engaged in a Battle: when the Lord
shall bend Judah for him, and fill his bow with Ephraim, and they shall have
the honor of the conquest, that have had their great share in their Torments,
and were by the enemies designed for destruction, and they shall fall by their
hand, it makes the mercy far the greater.

Fifthly, when it is such a mercy as lets us see still that God owns the same
cause, and however men warp and turn too and fro, yet the good old cause in
which the people of God were engaged against the Antichristian party, the Lord
owns that cause still, and gives unto his people hereby hopes of a settlement:
For the Lord Christ when he rides forth in the conquest of the Gospel, he does
ride forth conquering and to conquer (not all at once) but by degrees, and does
give to his people yet a ground of their faith to see, if they be of the seed
of the Jews before whom they have begun to fall, they shall surely fall; God
has given us therein, Hos. 2.15. the valley of Achor for a door of hope; it is
true that Achor was a pleasant valley, and it was sweet in it self; therefore it
was joined with Carmel and Bashan; but yet it was much more sweet in reference
to the hope: for it was at the first entrance into the Land of Canaan, and as
the first fruits gives them possession of the whole.

Sixthly, it is still a carrying on of the grand design that the Lord Christ
has to do in the world in the latter days; for Christ in glory has not only
Saints to gather home to himself, and to bind them all up in a bundle of life,
and he does reign for their sakes, for he is the head over all things for the
Churches sake: but the Lord has also enemies to be subdued; he must reign till
he has put all his enemies under his feet, and he will be faithful as the
Fathers servant in the one, as well as in the other: therefore, Rev. 14. there
is a harvest of all the Saints to be reaped, and there is a wine press of
wicked men at the same time to be trodden, etc. Now the great enemy unto Christ
in the latter days of the world is, that wicked one (...) that Baylon the
great, the Mother of Harlots. Now so far as this tends to the promoting of that
great design (as it does exceedingly) so far should the Saints of God rejoice
therein: for they must by degrees go into p^rdition: and though all the former
subjects would be fit matter for our meditation throughout this day, and might
have given us several Considerations of very public concernment in reference
to the mercy of the day, yet at present I have chosen this rather to draw out
your praises thereby: concerning which I shall present you but with these three
considerations.

First, the least return that you can make of a mercy, is praise to God for it;
and it is all that the Lord does expect of you. Hos. 14. and we will give thee
the calves of our lips: it is all the promise, that the Lord would have his
people make to him in the time of their straits. Afflictions they are
stupefactive and of a confounding nature, and they close the mouth, J^r. 8.14.
let us enter into our fenced Cities, and let us be silent there, for the Lord
our God has put us to silence: but mercies they are of an expansive and
dilating nature, and they open the mouth: as Hannah, not only her heart, 1 Samuel
2.1. was filled, but her mouth was enlarged also.

Secondly, if you do not return praises for mercies, God will surely add
Judgments unto mercies, and will turn his hand against you, do you evil after
he has done you good: Hezekiah received a mercy, but he did not render
according to the mercy: and this brought a Judgment upon him and upon the
whole land, 2 Chronicles. for let me tell you, of all things God can least bear the
despising and contempt of his mercies: there are two things that are very
terrible to the Saints, and that they are afraid of, and would be preserved
from. First that they reap not curses from the Ordinances of God, which are
usually the great means of blessing. Secondly, that they have not Judgments
grow out of mercies, because of their unanswerable walking under their present
enjoyments.

Thirdly the praises of the Saints are as terrible unto the Churches enemies as
their prayers: you think it is your duty to pray often: truly it is your duty
to praise God also: for Psalm. 8.2. out of the mouth of Babes and sucklings he
has ordained strength to still the enemy and the avenger: it is spoken of
Satan, and of all spiritual enemies. So the children of Israel, 2 Chronicles. when
they praised God in the beauty of Holiness, God set ambushments, and they
destroyed their enemies with the sword that proceeded out of their mouths,
Orabilibus telis, and that is as much by their praises as by their prayers:
therefore if you would not have the present mercy prove a future judgment, and
if you would have the work go on, let me exhort you as you did give in your
assistance in prayer for this beginning of mercy, so let not your praises be
wanting: withold not them for the perfection of it: So let all thy enemies
perish oh Lord, but let them that love thy name be as the Sun going forth in
its strength.

And now I address my self unto the words: out of which I would speak something
as matter of your thankfulness and meditation suitable unto this present
occasion. Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen: there are in the words four
things to be opened.

First who it is that speaks?

Secondly who this Babylon is of whom it is spoken?

Thirdly why called Babylon the great?

Fourthly why its put in praeterito pro futuro? is fallen: and why its set down
by way of ingemination? is fallen, is fallen, etc.

First who it is that speaks it, ver. 1. it is an Angel that came down from
Heaven, having great power, etc. By Angels some do expound the heavenly hosts,
those ministering spirits, that are sent forth for the good of the Elect: which
are therefore called principalities and powers, because of that great and that
glorious government that the Lord has committed unto them, during the Mediator
Kingdom of Christ, Ezech. 1. the spirit of the living creatures is in the
wheels: so that they have a great hand in the government and the administration
of all things below: and in this does their degrees of glory consist, in
officio, in the office in which the Lord Jesus does employ them: they differ
not in their nature at all, but only in their office, as Zanch. observes:
answerable unto what the Lord Jesus will employ them in: for they are the great
instruments and officers in the ordering of all things; and when Christ shall
give up his Kingdom, then shall they lay down theirs: for Cor. 1.15,28. he
shall put down all rule, authority and power, Calvin.
de principatu Angelico etiam intelligitur; all power and authority that was
set up by the oeconomical Kingdom of Christ, shall at the giving up of that
Kingdom be laid down: and therefore according unto the particular services, in
which God does employ the Angels, such a great work is committed unto one
Angel, and another great work is committed unto another, 2 Dan. 10,21. Zach.
6.8. the Instrument of Vengeance went forth into the North: So Rev. 7. there
are four Angels that held the four winds, that they must not blow upon the
earth: that is, motus bellicos, and Impetus hostiles: and some there are that
sound the Trumpet unto war, and then if the Angel go out before them, he stirs
up all the Instruments amongst men, and all things shall succeed accordingly to
that saying of Opera divinae providentiae Angelico administerio geruntur,
answerable unto the work; so there is an Angel to whom the great care of it is
by Christ committed; for they are ministering spirits sent forth for the good of
the Elect.

Some by Angels understand messengers and Instruments raised up amongst men,
whether Magistrates or Ministers; and so Brightman, Brightman
vir aliquis praestans and egregius, qui subito, nec expectatus adveniet,
quemadmodum res quae coelitus delabuntur. Suddenly and unexpectedly, as if he
had descended from heaven, some great instrument that the Lord would
unexpectedly raise up* which I should not understand of any individual persons,
and bring it down to this man and the other, as the seven Angels full of vials
unto Rome: not to seven individual persons, but for seven sorts of Instruments,
and officers, that God would successively raise up for to finish that work,
which should though they be many, all concur as one person to effect that
about which they are employed. Now I shall choose to put both these together,
and to understand it of heavenly Angels, which the Lord Christ imploys in these
administrations, which have the first hand in the work: and also all men, all
sorts of instruments and officers, that those Angels do stir up and employ; for
the Spirit of the living creatures is in the wheels; and when I am gone forth
the Prince of grace shall come: therefore the Angels, and the Instruments
stirrd up, and acted by the Angels, the Lord looks upon as but one person, etc.
So that first the ruin of Rome and all the Roman power is committed unto an
Angel; and therefore if all the power of the earth were engaged for it to
support Rome, yet this Angel is a mighty Angel, and he will surely destroy it:
and if an Angel has undertaken it, he will not want instruments, those that he
will surely in all ages stir up to effect it.

Secondly, Romes ruin as it is the work and office of the Angel, so it is unto
the Angels matter of joy and triumph: for as the conversion of the Saints is
joy to the Angels, so is the destruction of the enemies also; but especially
unto those Angels that are employed as officers therein, as Ezech. 9.1. there
are (...) unto the Angels the ordering of that great work was committed; and
therefore they are said to have the charge of it; the Babylonish Army did the
work, but the Angel that had the charge of it ordered it.

Secondly, of whom is this spoken? it is spoken of Babylon, Rev. 17.12.3. there
is a woman seen riding upon a scarlet-colored Beast, full of names of
blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns; and this woman has written upon
her forchead, mystery, Babylon the great the mother of Harlots: who is it?
ver. last, its that great City that reigns over the Kings of the Earth: Now
this could not be literally Babylon; for that was destroyed many hundred years
before John's time; but this is Babylon in a mystery; the City that now rules
over the Kings of the earth, and that was only Rome; a woman that did sit upon
many waters; (that is reigned over Kingdoms and Nations and people, etc) and
this woman is brought in riding, which is an Emblem and expression of power and
authority throughout this whole book: Now what is the Beast that the woman
rides upon? it is regnum sive imperium Romanum, which because of its blood and
its cruelty, has been always expressed by a Beast with a scarlet color, etc.
and this has three names given to it throughout this book: for all the old
enemies, that were ever any of the ancient persecutors of the Church, is to be
found in her, the blood of all the Saints; therefore is said to be found in
her, because in her was the cruelty of all former persecutors to be found, Rev.
11.8. spiritually Egypt, and Sodom: not literally Sodom; for their filthiness
called Sodom, and for their Idolatry Egypt and Babylon: for there is all
Idolatry, Sorcery and Cruelty; so that the evils that have been in all former
persecutors, is to be found in them: and therefore it is called Babylon by way
of allusion, as the Churches of Christ are called Zion and Jerusalem, and the
Israel of God, Rev. 7. the Lord keeping to the old names: so the enemies also
are called Egypt and Babylon, the Lord keeping unto the old names and ancient
resemblances: So then Rome and the power thereof, is here meant by Babylon: for
it is to be understood in a mystery, or in a spiritual sense.

Thirdly, why is it called Babylon the great? I answer it is called so upon a
double ground.

First, because of the greatness of its strength, and glory; it was the
strongest and the most fortified place in the world; in so much that when the
Lord did employ Cyrus in the work, it was thirteen years siege, that they were
fain to cut the River Euphrates into channels, and draw it dry, and enter the
City by the channels of the River; in that pit where Beltshazer the King and
the inhabitants of the City were found to be all of them buried: and she was
the original of the Nations unto which they did all bring their glory: and so
it is with this City, the merchants and the great men of the earth trade with
her, as Rev. 18.3. so that to see Romam in slore is one of the gloriousest
sights that this lower world could afford, which Fulgentius admiring, raised up
his heart higher by this consideration, Fulgentius
Quantum splendeat coelestis Jerusalem, cum adeo fulgeat terrestis Roma? etc.

Secondly, it is also Babylon the great, because of the greatness of their
power, and dominion: She did set upon many waters, and did rule all the Kings
of the earth, as Babylon did say of old, Are not my Princes altogether Kings?
and therefore, because of their dominion, they are called the great City, and
the great City that rules over the Kings of the Earth; and yet this great
Lucifer, son of the morning, must fall from Heaven and be brought down unto the
dust.

Fourthly how is it said, is fallen? put in praeterito;

First it is put in the Preterperfect; and that is ordinary with the Hebrews.

Secondly by way of Ingemination: and they do imply, First certainly: for it is
a speech of faith, speaking of things to come as if they were already past.
Secondly it notes the suddenness of it; it was at hand; as Christ said, it is
finished, that is, it was now near to be ended; and so, it is fallen: that is,
subito ruitura.

Thirdly it notes an utter ruin and destruction in the fall; for it is fallen,
it is fallen; (that is) it is greatly, eminently, utterly fallen.

Fourthly, it is a destruction generally published over all the world, and with
a great deal of joy spoken of by the Saints, as appears afterward, when they
give God the glory of taking vengeance of the great whore, etc. for the
repetitions in Scripture do really note great affection, Psalm. 22.1. My God, my
God, why have thou forsaken me? Psalm. 137.7, Down with it, down with it to the
ground: as Sam. 18.23. Absalom my Son, my Son: and Isa. 28.10. precept upon
precept, line upon line, etc. the expression is taken from Isa. 21.9. Babylon
is fallen, is fallen, etc. its spoken of ancient and litteral Babylon, and it
is applied unto mystical Babylon, Rev. 14.8. there we have a threefold
discovery of Antichrist. First, there is an Angel flies with the everlasting
Gospel; and they do publish the Doctrine of the grace of God in Christ, openly
against all the inventions of men: and denounce Judgments against all
Idolatry, etc. Secondly, Rome not repenting thereof, now the Lord declares it
to be Babylon, and a Church of God no more, and now it is fallen. Jam Ruinae
Babylonis jaciuntur fundamenta: and now the Lord having declared it to be
Babylon, does begin to prepare war against it. Thirdly, then the people of God
rise higher, and declare no communion with her, and that whoever does receive
her mark and Image, he shall drink of the pure wine of the wrath of God,
without mixture: Luther.
efficiam brevi ut Anathema sit esse Papistam: Luther.

But now the work is at hand; there is none of the enemies of Christ so great
as mystery Babylon: and there is none of his enemies toward whom he has used
so much patience and long suffering, bringing them to destruction but by
degrees: several vials have been pouring out upon her; degrees of wrath poured
out upon them, and yet every one of these degrees is a fall of Babylon: but yet
the last and utter ruin of it is to come: but it have ens, for the word is
gone forth of the mouth of the Lord, that he will have war with this Romish
Amaleck, and never have peace with it, till it be destroyed: He has said,
Great Babylon is fallen, etc.

Hence the Observations are Three:

First, Rome, mystery Babylon shall certainly fall.

Secondly, It shall utterly fall, and be broken with breach upon breach, and
destroyed with a double destruction.

Thirdly, The fall of it the Saints of God look upon as matter of the greatesl
joy and Triumph; Babylon is fallen, is fallen; it is a joyful voice to be heard
in Sion by the inhabitants thereof, and they that stand with the Lamb thereupon.

Doctrine.
The Doctrine from hence is: Rome, that is, mystical Babylon shall certainly
fall: which will appear if you consider these particulars:

First, consider the enemy that has set himself against Rome; is one that is
able to effect it, and that is the great and the Almighty God: and if he lift
up his hand to reap, if he whet his glittering sword, he will surely make a
slaughter, Rev. 18.8. strong is the Lord God who judges her: it is true,
Babylon has all the strength of the earth on her party, the Kings of the earth
do bring their glory to her, and give their power and strength to the Beast; it
is (...), all their natural power and strength is given to her, and all their
civil power and strength or authority: and therefore a man would think it
impossible for any to make war with the Beast: But they have a strong God
against them, and he has undertaken it, and the Lord will never make peace
with Rome: this is that spiritual Amalek with whom God will never make peace
from Generation to Generation: there be some of the enemies of God that shall
be converted in the latter days: and many of those Kings the Lamb shall
overcome, not by their destruction, but by their conversion: for he will uphold
them afterward, though they had been his enemies: but with Rome he will never
have peace, but will be a professed enemy unto them for ever: the enmity
between God and them is like the enmity between the seed of the woman and of
the Serpent, that shall never be reconciled, never have an end.

Secondly, look upon the causes of their destruction: and they are mainly four,
and all of them will bring eminent destruction with them:

First, because they corrupted Religion, and that both in doctrine and worship:
they have made all the Nations of the earth drunk with the wine of her
fornication; and this they have done in a golden cup: they make fair and
specious pretenses, and call themselves the Church of God: Romae venduntur
omnia: nihil tamen agas sine lege and formula sanctissimi moris: Lud. Viv.
Ludov. Vives. Religion in Doctrine and worship is very dear to God, and he
will not have it to be corrupted: and therefore he is an utter enemy unto
corrupters; but this is the mother of Harlots; and of all the abominations of
the earth.

Secondly, because the Kings of the earth have committed fornication with her;
Rome has been the great corrupter of Kings, and of all men that have been
eminent in authority; and this is their last refuge, Rev. 16.14. they send
forth their Emissaries unto the Kings of the Earth, and of the whole world: it
is a great influence that they have had upon the authority of the world: Now
Kings they stand in the place of God, and bear his Image in respect of
government: to have them corrupted is a great provocation unto God, and a great
occasion of destruction unto the world.

Thirdly, by reason of her merchandise, the merchants of the earth are waxed
rich through her delicacies: what is this merchandise? it cannot be meant of
merchandises in a litteral and proper sense: where it is said, ver. 11.12. the
merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her, etc. not that men shall
merchandise no more for gold, and pearl, and precious things, which ordinarily
merchants trade about: the merchandise of them shall not cease when Rome shall
be destroyed: for the world shall continue, and trading shall still be. In the
13. ver. we read part of their merchandise to be the souls of men: Brightman
quae nullo modo in propria vocum natura haerere, scimus nos. It is spoken of
spiritual merchandise, making sale of the things of God, and the Ordinances of
God, and the souls of men for their own gain and advantage: which is unto the
Lord a great provocation: Rome is another Tire: as Tire was the Mart of the
earth for temporal things so is this City nobile emporium rerum spiritualium,
and men grow great and are advanced by this merchandise, etc.

Fourthly, for her cruelty, Chap. 18.24. in her was found the blood of the
Prophets, and of all the Saints that were slain upon the earth; and God will
not suffer the blood of his Sains to lie unrevenged the cry of blood the Lord
cannot deny to hear, though it be but the blood of men: but much more the blood
of Saints: for precious in his sight is their blood; he has a bottle for their
tears, much more will he make inquisition for blood: and if the blood of any
one of his Saints be such a burden that God cannot bear it at the hands of
men; how much more when the blood of all the Saints shall be shed, the Prophets
and Martyrs of Jesus? Specially considering that their cruelty shall grow, and
they shall be mo^e bloody toward their end; for whereas, the witnesses before
did but prophesies in Sackcloth and ashes: now they must have a time to be
killed, and that with the greatest cruelty and revenge: they shall rejoice over
them, and keep their dead bodies upon the earth, and no man shall bury them.

Thirdly, it is the great design that Christ has in the latter days of the
world, to destroy this Beast; the last enemy, Dan. 7. is the fourth Beast: and
in the fourth Beast there is a little horn that shall be more sierce then his
fellows: and ver. 11. before that the words that the horn spoke, I beheld till
the Beast was destroyed: all the Roman power does perish in the little horn: in
the destruction of Antichrist, all the Roman power shall be utterly broken:
there were ten horns that did arise upon the rise of the Beast, and there was
government given them, and power successively: but when this little horn shall
be destroyed: never a horn shall stand up in the place thereof any more; and
therefore, Rev. 16. we see the vials that are poured out are but degrees of
wrath upon Rome Antichristian, and we have seen many of them in a very glorious
and unexpected way already accomplished, and therefore we have great cause to
trust Christ for the effecting of the rest; and he will turn the heart of the
Kings against them that they shall hate the whore; they that did support her,
they shall become the greatest instruments to destroy her; as the seals have
had their effect upon Rome Pagan, and the Trumpets upon Rome Christian, so
shall the vials upon Rome Antichristian; for this book of the Revelations does
mainly concern Rome: for there is a double prophecy; fata Ecclesiae and
Imperii: and they are the two great works Christ has in design after his
ascension.

Fourthly, it shall surely be destroyed, because they shall never repent, Rev.
16.9,11. When the vial is poured out upon the world, they were scorched with
sire; exceedingly enraged, and they blasphemed the name of God which had power
over these plagues, but they repented not to give glory: and upon the seat of
the Beast, they Blasphemed God because of their pain, but repented not of their
evil deeds; and the ground of it is, because most of them generally, they that
embrace the Doctrine and worship, are reprobates: and the Scripture does make
it a dangerous sign of reprobation, Chap. 13.8.17.8. They that wonder, who are
they? such whose names are not wrote in the Book of life from the foundation of
the world: Now if men be under the hand of God in wrath, and one judgment does
make way for another, God will punish them seven times more: surely they must
be utterly destroyed at the last: so it was with Rome, one Judgment makes way
for another: and one vial does prepare and fit the subject for another: So that
as unto the Saints one mercy does but prepare the subject, and open the door
unto another, so also to ungodly men one judgment makes way for another, and
their hearts are hardened unto their own destruction.

Fifthly, it is the expectation of Christ, and all the Saints, and all their
prayers have been poured out this way. First it is the expectation of Christ,
he is sat down at the right hand of God, (...), expecting the rest, which God
has promised him, that all his enemies shall be made his footstool; and
Christ's prayers shall be heard, and his expectation shall not be frustrated,
nor made void; and all the Saints have laid up prayers for it, for Rev. 16.1.
the vials come out of the Temple: there is a double voice in this book, a voice
from the throne, quod immediate a deo prosiciscitur; and out of the Temple, cum
precibus sanctorum Impetratur, Brightman
Brightman. Therefore all the degrees of wrath that Rome has had upon her,
has been from the prayers of the Saints, and not by their Power, and it has
been their expectation long ago, that Rome should be utterly ruined: Lactantius
Horreo dicere, dicam tamen, quia futurum est, Romanum nomen de terra
amovebitur.

Now God that has raised this expectation in the hearts of his people, and
drawn out this supplication, he will not frustrate their expectations, he will
fulfill their petitions.

Doct. 2.
All the Roman Power shall utterly fall: they shall be destroyed with double
destruction, Jer. 17.18. and the sword shall be double upon them, Ezekiel. 21.14.
Babylon is fallen, is fallen:

First the destruction of Babylon as from God, it shall be pure wrath, without
mixture, Rev. 14.10. they had a cup of fornication with which they made all
Nations to drink; Now God has a cup of indignation also, that which they must
all drink, and it is poured out without mixture; if water be mixed with wine,
it breaks the force of the wine, so that it does not so soon bring a man to
drunkenness as pure wine does: this notes summum poenae severitatem, judgment
without mercy. Here the judgments of God that he executes upon men, have mercy
mixed with them; there is a mixture of light with all their darkness, non
dantur puraetenebrae: but in Hell there shall be judgment without mercy, and
fury without compassion: and truly the judgment that shall come upon Rome
shall have a great resemblance of the Torments of Hell with it: and therefore
their judgment is very terrible.

Secondly, it shall be an utter destruction, which shall be the more Tormenting
because it shall be in the height of their hopes, Rev. 18.7. when she shall
say, I set as a Queen, and am no widd^w, and shall see no sorrow: the thoughts
of Babylon have been and still are high, and are eminently confident of
victories and successes, and yet ver. 8. her plagues come in one day, as Sodoms
with fire and brimstone, Rev. 14.10. they shall be tormented with fire and
brimstone; God will as it were rain Hell out of Heaven upon them: he has fire
and brimstone for this spiritual Sodom, that they shall not know it till it
comes upon them: when they think themselves safe, then shall judgment come,
and Babylon shall fall into the Sea like a millstone suddenly and
irrecoverably.

Thirdly, the judgment shall come upon all parties, and upon all degrees and
conditions of men that join with them; all those that do partake of their sins,
shall have a share of the plagues: there is a vial upon the earth, that is upon
the common people.

Secondly upon the Sea also there is a vial, the jurisdiction of Rome.

Thirdly, upon the rivers, their ministers and Instruments that advance this
authority, all the ministry of Rome that carry abroad this power over the
world.

Fourthly, upon the Sun, all Princes and Magistrates, and all powers so far as
they hold of Rome.

Fifthly, there will be a vial also upon Rome it self, the throne of the Beast;
in the Lords time, all this will be accomplished, and the day hastens apace,
and there is no degree from the highest to the lowest that shall escape: no
place shall protect a man; for the vial is poured out by the Lord, and there is
no escaping.

Fourthly, there is an utter desolation described; it shall become an
habitationfor Devils, which love to be in solitary and desolate places, and it
shall be a cage for every unclean and hateful bird; as Sodom was, it shall be a
monument of wrath unto all the world, Isa. 13.19,20. Rev. 18.22,23. The voice
of Harpers and Trumpeters shall be heard no more in thee, etc. and the light of
a candle shall shine no more at all in thee, etc.

Fifthly, God will stir up the Instruments of vengeance to do their utmost to
destroy them; as he had before put it in the hearts of the 10. Kings to set her
up: so shall he also put it into their hearts to cast her down, they shall make
her desolate and naked, and eat her flesh, and burn her with fire, Rev. 17.16.
and Rev. 18.6. reward her as she rewarded you, double upon her double: and if
the Lord put a principle of vengeance into the hearts of men, and command them
to do it, surely the destruction may be exceeding fearful, when the Lord does
bid and command men to be cruel.

Lastly, it shall make way for their eternal destruction. For a man to undergo
Temporal afflictions, though they be grievous, yet it were not so much, so his
soul might be saved in the day of the Lord: but when death goes before, and
Hell follows after, this is the greatest misery: Now this is the condition of
all that follow the Beast, and receive his mark, whose names are not written in
the Book of the Lamb; and therefore Rev. 19.20. the Beast was taken and the
false Prophet, and they were cast alive into a Lake that did burn with fire and
brimstone: Truly then it is terrible when judgments do make way for a man's
everlasting destruction, and eternal ruin.

Doct. 3.
The destruction of Rome, and every degree of it, the Saints of God do look
upon as matter of joy and triumph: the righteous shall be glad when he sees the
vengeance that shall come upon Rome, and shall with a holy scorn say, as they
do upon the fall of litteral Babylon, Isa. 14. How art thou fallen from Heaven,
O Lucifer, son of the morning: Rev. 19.1. There is a voice of much people in
Heaven: Heaven that is put for the Church, saying, Amen Hallelujah, because the
Lord had judged the great whore, etc.

But, what is there in their destruction that is such matter of joy? to hear of
the shedding of blood, and the destruction of many thousands, and those many of
them poor souls very unfit to dye? to see them in garments rouled in blood, is
this matter of joy? a man would rather think you should rather sit down and
sigh, to the breaking of your loins. There are many things in it matter of joy
and triumph unto the Saints; as first they rejoice in the Judgments of God,
Rev. 19 2. True and righteous are thy judgments; for thou have judged the
great whore; they do taste a sweetness even in the judgments of God, as Ezekiel.
3.1. it was in my belly as honey; even that roll which contained nothing but
bitter lamentations, yet it was very sweet to him: the Saints love to see
Christ with his sword girt upon his thigh: and clothed with a vesture dipped in
blood, and treading the wine press alone, traveling in the greatness of his
strength, Isa. 63.1,2.

Secondly, because God has appeared for the Churches cause, and has owned
their quarrel, and has avenged the blood of his servants at their hands, Rev.
19.2. when God does appear for them, and does not leave them unto the will of
their enemies, but does awake as a Giant in the behalf of his people, this has
always occasioned songs and rejoicing in his people; the Lord has triumphed
gloriously over the horse and his rider, Exo. 15. not that they do triumph
merely upon the account of their own safety: but they triumph because God has
triumphed over his enemies: else to see so many drowned in the mercyless grave,
who would not have pittyed them?

Thirdly, of all the Churches enemies that ever were, this is the cruelest
enemy; the fourth beast is worse then any of the former; and in the fourth
beast the little horn was more fierce then his fellows; they have been always
drunk with blood, and their endeavor was to wear out the Saints of the most
High.

Fourthly, it shall be the last enemy; for as soon as they shall be destroyed,
the seventh Trumpet sounds, and then shall the mystery of God be finished: it
has been an enemy to the Church of longest continuance of any: their
oppressions have lain longest upon the Church of God; and the longer a burden
does lie and has been complained of, the greater mercy you would count it to
have it taken off: if to be 430. years in Egypt, and 70. years in Babylon, be a
long time for the people of God to endure: yet this is a bondage that lasts
1260. days in the greatest tyranny and rage that can be: they Tread down the
Temple, Rev. 11.1,2.

Fifthly, when this enemy shall be destroyed, the cup of her fornication shall
be removed, by which the men of the earth, but specially the Kings of the earth
have been made drunken, Rev. 18.11. Now there is no man shall be their
merchants more: they had Chap-men abundantly before, but now there shall be a
dealing in that trade no more: the same God that did cast out Satan in the
Pagan way of Idolatry, will also cast out Satan in the Antichristian way of
Idolatry: but they shall not deceive the earth by such sorceries any more: for
there is by this means a cloud that has filled the house, and no man could
enter into the Temple, Rev. 15.8. there was no considerable number of
menconverted, there was such a darkness and a smoke upon the ordinances of God
and all his dispensations: but all shall be removed.

Sixthly, Lastly from the glorious fruit and consequences that shall follow
upon the destruction of Antichrist, the people of God will have great cause to
rejoice and praise God: I Will name only these four.

First then the Kingdoms of the world shall become the Kingdom of the Lord and
of his Christ, Rev. 11.15. there shall be multitudes converted unto the Lord.

Secondly it shall be the inlet of all the promises: now Christ shall be
called, the word of God: he was so before, but now he is called so for the
accomplishment of it: as Exodus 3.6. by the name Jehovah God was not known unto
them.

Thirdly, then all persecutions shall cease, Rev. 20. Satan shall be bound, so
that he shall not stir up the world to the persecution of the Saints, as he had
done in times past.

Fourthly, New Jerusalm shall come down from God out of Heaven; there shall be
that glory of the Church that the Kingdom and dominion under the whole Heavens
shall be given up to it, and they shall possess it for ever and ever, Dan. 7.
the mountain of the Lords house shall be exalted on the top of the mountains;
there is a triumphant state of the Church that is yet to come in this life:
when all the glory of the world shall be brought unto the Church and people of
God.

Use.
Seeing God has in a degree accomplished this in this late mercy, do you
rejoice with Triumph, and say great Babylon is fallen; for they are some of the
most blind and Jesuited Papists in the world, and those that profess o^herwise,
yet they do enter upon the Popish interest, and engage in the same quarrel with
them; and take heed you be not deceived with vain words; we see how not only
this, but the neighbor Nations do declare against them that seek to promote
that cause of tyranny and oppression which you have hitherto fought against:
let not your discontents carry you to the quite contrary point of the compass:
and your zeal against sects and heresies, make you to succor their profaneness,
and to enter upon their interest, and thereby to destroy that which you have
endeavored to build, and to pluck down with your own hands, that which you
have so much with your purses and prayers labored to set up. I Will only speak
briefly to these five particulars, to quicken you in this duty of praising God.

First it is a command that God does give to all his Saints to rejoice at
Babylons downfall, Rev. 18.20. rejoice over her thou heaven; universa sanctorum
multitudo, all the Saints, but specially the Prophets and the Apostles, the
saithful Preachers of the word of God, let not them be last in their joy and
praises, that had the great hand and were first in praying for it: it is your
duty, and it lies as a command upon you, and if you make conscience of other
commands, do not for fancies dispense with this.

Secondly, they be Romes merchants only that be sad at it; let them say, Rev.
18.10. Alas alas that great City Babylon, that mighty City: this does not befit
the Sons of Zion, but the merchants of Babylon; and truly let me tell you, a
man may receive the mark of the beast in his right hand, and may strongly
promote the Popish interest, that does never wear^t by profession in his
forehead.

Thirdly, if Babylon shall fall, then come out of her my people, says your
God: when Rome does fall, now is the time to preach that Doctrine: there may be
many of the Elect of God that may delitescere, and be ensnared by Rome some way
or other, that do not wholly follow the Beast, and receive his Image: but how
ever now God goes forth in Judgment, come out of her: let me exhort you in the
name of the Lord, do not cleave to Rome: now you will surely partake in her
plagues, if you do join with her in her sins: and if you take part with her
now, you come in at the worst time when it is falling, when Popery is falling:
now ye that have been against it, prayed against it, fought against it, and now
by a wile to be brought into it to support it, when it is falling, now its
Judgment is at hand, it is the greatest vanity that can be.

Fourthly: then a man were better with patience suffer with Sion, and the
Churches party a while: rather then join with the Romish party and be ruined
with them in his end, Rev. 14.12. here is the patience of the Saints; ye shall
suffer a while and be trodden down by them, and you must stay for the full
accomplishment of this promise for your deliverance; but I will surely come and
will recompense all your patience; and therefore be nor discouraged and faint
in your minds, let not your hearts turn back unto Egypt, and hanker after Rome,
and those remnants of Baal, which God will surely destroy.

Fifthly, how abundant should you be now in prayer for these two reasons?

First, because the time draws near, now your prayers shall not be long
unanswered, Dan. 2.19. and ye shall be sure of a gracious answer.

Secondly, the Lord does let you see, that he has begun the work; now follow
him: the Promises do begin to bring forth, let us not be wanting to assist them
in the birth: if ever you would pray, do it now, when God is doing the mercy:
and you may expect a present return: the Judgments of God upon his enemies and
yours do invite your prayers.

Lastly, beg of God for your Governors, that they may never comply with Rome:
which has brought so great miseries upon all Christian Princes and estates,
complying with Rome upon Politic respects, thoug not upon Religious: O let us
abhor it, and desire God to keep their hearts from it: for Rome shall perish
Babylon shall fall; and truly there is no party be the what they will be, and
let his respect be what it will, that do comply with them, but they will fall
with them; for they are the people of Gods curse, with whom God will never make
peace, and therefore neither should we: Queen Elizabeth's Motto was, No peace
with Spain: So I say, No peace with Rome: and truly that is the way to have
peace amongst your selves, and to have your work carried on strongly, when you
do firmly stand with the Lamb upon mount Sion; and be not shaken sometimes this
way and sometimes that way: savouring this way, and then another, as it serves
our Politic ends: God is with you whilst you be with him; and if you be
through for him he will be so for you; if you be not, the Lord will surely
leave you to perish by that hand with whom you sinfully comply: as the people
of Israel did when they complied with Assyria: if they will go to King Jareb,
or go to Egypt for help they shall surely by the same hand perish, and the
Judgment came upon them from their helpers in the end.

Gospel Order, A CHURCHES Beauty.
Preached when Mr. Strong was chosen Pastor, Dec. 9. 1650.
Col. 2.5. For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the
spirit, joying and beholding your order, etc.


CAlvin upon this place says, that the Churches perfection does stand in these
two things, in their faith, and in their order: and indeed all things that are
necessary to its glory, that it may be presented without spot to God, are to be
reduced to these heads: It is your perfection that I earnestly desire, 2 Cor.
13.9. Therefore I shall endeavor to instruct you in both these: that you may
be led on to perfection by it. As for matters of faith, it has been the
constant course of my ministry amongst you; Now I shall speak something to
matters of order; that so there may be no part of the council of God that
concerns your duty hid from you.

Now the order of a Church does consist in three things: and so I find the word
(...) used in the Scripture. First it is put for the holy and orderly walking
of every particular member, when they do all walk by rule, 1 These. 5.14. Warn
them that are unruly, disorderly, 2 These. 3.6. Withdraw from every brother that
walks disorderly: (that is) that does not walk with a right foot toward the
Gospel: whose conversation is not holy as becomes the Gospel of Christ: and so
order belongs unto men's conversion.

Secondly, it is put for the right administration of all the Ordinances of God,
according to the rules and Institutions of God, Heb. 1.5,6. The order of
Melchizedeck, is nothing else but the Institutions, or prescribed rules given
unto Melchizedeck; and the order of Aaron, are the rules prescribed by God for
the Priesthood of Aaron: and so Bezaon Hebrews, cap. 7.15. makes the word (...)
and (...), to be all one: and so we use it, 1 Chronicles. 15.13. We sought him not
after the due order: that is, according to the rule, and to the institutions of
God: so that when all ordinances are administered according to the Lords
Institution, that is the order of the Church; for then the order of God is
observed.

Thirdly, it notes the due subordination that is appointed by Christ to be
observed in the Church: for that also is order, 1 Cor. 15.23. All shall arise,
but every man in his own order: First Christ, and then they that are Christ's at
his coming: and so order is opposed to confusion, when no man knows nor keeps
his own place and station in the body: When they that rule, keep their place,
and they that are to be ruled keep their place: and they do it with subjection
to Christ, as being concluded under the Power of an Institution, that is
properly order: for the word (...), is military, and taken from the order of an
Army: Now there are three things that make an orderly army.

First, that every soldier walks honestly, and does not oppress and run out of
their rank.

Secondly, that the Governors and Commanders do keep their places and do their
duty in them.

Thirdly, that all that is to be done, be done according unto the rule of the
Commanders; and by their the Soldiers do nothing of themselves, and by their
own appointments; and this is properly the order of an Army: when every one
does keep his own rank, does his own duty, etc.

I should speak of the orderly administering of ordinances. Secondly, the
orderly walking of members: Thirdly, the orderly carriage that should be
between officers, and members: each of them keeping their place, and unto each
other performing the duty of their relation: and it is this last on which I
shall speak of at this time.

You are met here at this time for the election of a Pastor; for no man is to
take upon himself an office in the Church, but one that is set apart by God
thereunto: and the way by which God does set men apart for this office, is, by
the election of the people: whose power or whose privilege it is to choose
their own officers that shall be over them: as appears in that instance of the
Deacons the lowest officers, Acts 6.5. they choose them, and the Apostles ordain
them unto the office; and when the people choose those persons that are
qualified according unto the rules prescribed in the word, then they may
conclude these are the officers that God has so^ over us: and the Holy Ghost
has made us over seers, and the officers are to take it as a call from God,
unto the employment: and being chosen, it is not to be looked upon as a humane,
but as a divine institution, and he that is chosen is to be looked upon as an
officer unto Christ: and to have his power from Christ, according to the rules
of the word, over that people: It is necessary therefore in so weighty a
business, that you should know the grounds upon which you go: and what the
office is unto which you are now to elect a person: and what the Order is which
the Lord has set down to be observed between the Pastor and the people: that
so you may know what to expect from him in way of duty: and what he in a way of
duty is to expect from you; that so the order of God between both may be
observed.

First, what is the office of a Pastor? The office of a Pastor is an
Institution of Christ: all that rule in the Church do rule under Christ, and
therefore they must have their office from him; it is not for men to make a new
officer in the Church any more then it is for them to make new ordinances in
the Church; as all offices in a State are appointed by the supreme power, and
there is no man is to take an office upon him that they do not authorize: so
also it is with the Church, 1 Cor. 12.28. he has set over them in the Church.
Ephesians. 4.11. he gave gifts to men: that is, the office, and the gifts that did
qualify for the office: officers that are set in the Church are of two sorts:
some temporary, as Aposiles, Prophets and Evangelists: and their gifts were but
for a time: the gifts did cease with the office: but there are some officers
that are standing, and are to continue in the Church until the end of the
world: for there is a work of the ministry that must continue till we all come
to the unity of the faith, for the gathering and the perfecting of the Saints;
till we all come to the unity of the faith: that is, till all the Saints of God
that are scattered abroad all the world over, be gathered together to the unity
of the faith: that is, if they be converted, and do all believe: For there is
but one faith which all the Elect of God must have, and till that be begun and
their sanctification be perfected, till they all do become a perfect man, and
attain to the fullness of the stature of Christ, that he has himself appointed
them in this life to attain to before they be translated to glory; therefore
such officers in the Church Christ has instituted, and and he will continue
them till the end of the world: so long as there are any Saints to be gathered,
or graces in them to be perfected.

Secondly, the election of a Pastor is the privilege of the people; and in
that the will of Christ is made manifest, and the call of Christ is to both the
person chosen, and the people: its given them by Christ, and they are
thankfully to accept it, and carefully to improve it, and preserve it, and not
suffer them to be taken from them; the Saints of God are to look upon
privileges to be saved as well as promises, and they must not part with any of
them.

First, the Apostles, Acts 6.5. that had the highest authority under Christ,
yet they did not take upon them to impose any officers upon the Churches, but
they must look them out, and they must choose them, then the Apostles will
ordain them; and surely they that would not impose a Deacon, which is the
meanest officer, they will not impose any higher officer: and it is the rule
that the Apostle gives, 1 Timothy 3.10. (...), they must be proved first: and also
approved by the people: for the word signifies both to try a thing, and upon
trial to approve it.

Secondly, the ordering all things in a Church state does plainly argue it: for
every thing there is done by mutual consent; and there can be no union in the
body, but by their own consent; for as consent does unite us unto Christ, so it
does also amongst our selves: for in all things, as it is in the Church
invisible, faith and holiness in Truth makes a man a member of the Church
invisible; so the profession of that faith and holiness makes a man a member of
the visible Church: consent of the heart makes a man a member of the Church
invisible; and this consent professed makes a man a member of the Church
visible: and as it is between the members, so also it is between members and
officers: for all power is of three sorts: either it is natural, or voluntary,
or tyrannical: now all Church power cannot be natural; and it must not be
tyrannical; therefore it must be voluntary, and by the consent of parties; 1
Cor. 5.12. Do not ye Judge those that are within, says the Apostle? therefore
they that were within came under this power of judgment, because they had
given consent unto that power to live under it, and to be ruled by it: whereas
they that were without, and did not consent to it, they were not subject to it,
or bound by it.

Thirdly, from this election of the people, there does arise a voluntary
relation between the Pastor and the people, Acts 20.28. The Elders of Ephesus
came to Paul, and he commands them to take heed unto themselves, and to all the
flock over which the holy Ghost has made you overseers: and Col. 4.12. it is
said of Epaphras, that he is one of you: for he was Pastor of the Church of
Coloss. and so, the Angels of the seven Churches: there were some general
officers over all the Churches as the Apostles were, and so were Evangelists,
and those that planted Churches: but there are particular Church Officers that
have a relation to such a people by virtue of their election, and their own
acceptance: and they stand in the relation of an officer unto that people
only, and unto none other; so that though by virtue of their commission from
Christ they preach as the ministers of the Gospel unto any people; yet by
virtue of the election of the people they have the relation of Pastors to none
but those that chose them so to be.

Fourthly, the office of a Pastor is to be reduced to two heads: First the
duties that he does owe to the people. Secondly, the dispositions with which
those duties are to be performed.

First the duties that he does owe to the people, and which he is by virtue of
his calling bound to perform; and these duties are,

First he is bound to instruct them: Christ is the great Shephard of the Sheep;
they are but Shepherds under him: Christ feeds the flock, and so they must do:
Jer. 3.15. the promise is, I will give them Pastors after my own heart, that
shall feed them with knowledge and understanding: therefore, 1 Timothy 3.2. He
that is a Pastor, he must be able and apt to teach: he that is not able to feed
a people with knowledge and understanding, he is not qualified for this office;
feeding you know is a constant and a daily thing; he must supply them with new
food from day to day, bring out of his Treasury things new and old, Mat. 13.52.

First he must be one that has a Treasury, a stock to spend upon, that will
not be spent or drawn dry. Secondly he must have all sorts of knowledge, things
new and old: what ever may be either profitable, or taking to the people, he
must be furnished with: it is an allusion, Par. observes of new and old wine:
some are taken with old wine, and some desire new; and some say, Give us both
new and old: that is the knowledge of the Law, and of the Gospel; or else it
may be their meaning in new notions, and old experiences, and he must bring
them forth also for the people (silk wormlike) weave it out of themselves
continually.

And the Pastors duty in point of teaching is reduced to three heads.

First, it is the duty of the Pastor to catechize them, and instruct them in
principles, in the foundations of the Doctrine of Christ; they that are
unskilful in the word of righteousness must have milk, Heb. 5.13. and so the
Pastors office is set forth, Gal. 6.6. (...) and (...), he that is catechized
in the word: and so he is to take care of the weak ones in the Church, and of
the children of the Church Members, that they be instructed also.

Secondly, he is to lead them to perfection: Heb. 6.1. for their care must be
to build them up further, Acts 20.32. not that they should stand at a stay in
knowledge, but grow in knowledge, that the whole connsel of God may be known to
them, and the word of God may dwell richly in them; their knowledge praised,
and thereby their graces improved; for the Pastors are debtors unto men for
meat, as well as unto babes for milk.

Thirdly, they are to convince the gainsayers, Tit. 1.9. that if there be
corrupt tenants, and wicked Doctrines vented, the Pastor should take care to
strengthen, and stablish the people against them, that they may not be as
children carried away with every wind of Doctrine, Ephesians. 4.14. For it is whilst
men slept, through the carelessness and negligence of the Pastors it is, that
the enemies have such power and opportunity of sowing tares, as they have, Acts
20.30. he bids them watch against the Wolves.

Secondly, he is to pray for the people, Romans 1.9. God is my witness, that I
make mention of you always in my prayers: Col. 1.3. praying always for you:
and in this, though Paul was an extraordinary officer; yet he is a standard and
an example for our duty; we are to pray for the people; and to do all that does
belong to them to do for the Church; and here consider three things.

First, they are to acquaint themselves with the state of the flocks, that so
they may know their particular necessities and wants, that they may go to God
for them for suitable supplies: he that is a Shepherd, must know the state of
his flock.

Secondly, they are to pray for them not only ex charitate ut fratres, but, ex
officio: the brethren are to pray for one another as brethren, it is their
duty; but the Pastors they are to do it as men in office, and as those that God
has appointed, and has instituted unto that work: and therefore they may
expect to be answered for them, in what ever petition they put up to God: they
may look for a gracious return of their prayers; as we see under the Law it was
enjoined, Joel 2.17. Let the Priests, the Ministers of the Lord weep between
the Porch and the Altar, and let them say, Spare thy people O Lord, etc.

Thirdly, they must pray for particular persons according to their necessities,
and engage their interest unto God for them: James 5. Is any sick amongst you?
let them call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray, etc. Laboring
to keep the Judgment off from the body of any particular member of it; if any
man be sick, the Elders of the Church may pray over him, and they shall save
the sick, and labor to attain the pardon of the sins that occasioned the
sickness, etc.

Thirdly, he must watch over them, Act. 20.28. Take heed of all the flock; not
in a careless and a formal manner; for the Lord says, Son of man, I have made
thee a VVatch-man, and thou shall watch over this people, Ezech. For I will
require their blood at thy hands; But how must he watch over them? First he
must observe diligently that they be not corrupted in Doctrine, and he must
contend carnestly for the faith, that they be not turned away from the Truths
of the Gospel. Secondly, he must watch over them that they be not defiled in
their conversations, that there do no root of bitterness spring up amongst
them, that he neither suffer the Doctrine of the Nicolaitans, or the woman
Jezebel: one by Doctrine, and the other by practice, to corrupt the Church.

Thirdly, he is to observe and watch that their graces do not decay: and that
they do not fall from their first ^ve; but he is to quicken them in duty, and
stir them (...) from day to day, Eccl. 12.11. He is to fasten the goads and
nails given by one Shepherd. Fourthly, if any be sick he is to visit them; the
Elders of the Church are to be sent to them. Fifthly, if any of them be
offended, or misled he is to labor to reduce them; the wandering sheep he is
to bring home upon his shoulders; if any be going astray, he shall seek that
sheep and bring him back again to the fold. Sixthly, if any be weak he is to
comfort them; he is to bear the Lambs in his bosom, to mourn with them, and
have compassion over them: and this he is to do not only for some of the great
ones, but he is to do it impartially over all the flock: For God makes no
difference in respect of any man's title, or place, but he that has the best
heart, is the best man in Gods account, and in Church members those should be
esteemed by us, that have the greatest graces, not the greatest places.

Fourthly, it is the Pastors duty, if any man in the Church walk disorderly or
inordinately, he is to mourn for them, Jer. 13.17. My soul shall weep in secret
for your pride: and Phil. 3.18. Now I tell you weeping, etc. Their miscarriage
should be to him as the errors of a child unto a tender Father; he should
bewail them with bitterness; to consider how they thereby go about to destroy
themselves, should exceedingly affect the Pastor; as Christ when he beheld
Ierusalems sins he wept over it; and many times there is nothing left for a
minister to do for a person but to shed tears.

Secondly, he is to admonish them, and that authoritatively, ^ These. 5.12. Know
them which labor amongst you, and are over you, and admonish you in the Lord
(that is) by virtue of the authority that is committed unto me by Christ, I do
admonish you in the Lord: and this is to do a thing in the name of the Lord
Jesus Christ, 1 Cor. 5.4. Yea reprove them sharply: and so Paul does propose it
unto the Corinthians, Whither he should come to them with the rod or in the
spirit of meckness.

Thirdly, if nothing else will do, they must together with the Church, in which
they are, have the main hand, they are to stir them up to cast out such a
person, and to represent it to the Church according to the power that is
committed unto them by Christ for the Churches edification, Rev. 2.3. they must
not bear them that be evil, they must be cast out; they should look upon it as
their Burden, that any amongst them should deserve to be cast out from the
Church, yet they must do their duty: this is the rule that they have over you
in the Lord, Heb. 13.17.

Fifthly, they must walk as examples to the flock, 1 Pet. 5.3. Go before them
in a holy life; 2 John 10. it is said, Christ is the Shepherd, and he goes
before the sheep, and his sheep do follow him; the meaning is, he went before
them in a holy conversation; for he has in all things given us an example: a
Copy to write after, that we should walk as he has walked; Pastors should be a
living Scripture, and walking Bibles, more then any other men; and yet ye are
to take this as a rule, be you followers of us, as we are of Christ: and mark
them who so walks as they have us for an example, Philip. 3.17.

Secondly, for the dispositions with which all these duties are to be done,
which I will lay down in six particulars.

First, from a tender love and care; God does put this care of the flock unto
those whom he calls to be their Overseers in mercy, and he does give them
graces suitable, Pastors graces, 2 Cor. 8.16. God did put the same care into the
heart of Titus, Phil. 2.26. Epaphroditus, that was their Pastor, he does long
for them exceedingly, and his love was so great, that he would not have them so
much as grieved, and therefore he was sorry that they had heard that he had
been sick: there was in the heart of our Lord Christ a Law of love written; thy
Law is in the middle of my bowels; as there should be a love amongst the
members, so in a special manner in those that are Pastors and Fathers to a
people, their bowels should yern over them.

Secondly, all this is to be done with the spirit of meekness; in a way of
Ministry, and not in a way of Majesty: For we are but your servants for Christ's
sake: and we are not to rule as Lords over Gods heritage, 1 Pet. 5.3. and
therefore pride, and imperiousness, must be avoided; for all that we have to do
is by the word, and we can rule no other way.

Thirdly, all things must be done without self-respects, and to make a gain of
the people; we must feed the flock not for filthy lucres sake; that though the
Pastor is to eat of the milk of the flocks and though it be the peoples duty: 1
Cor. 9.14. God has ordained that they should: yet this is not to be the end
propounded by the Minister or Pastor unto themselves: for them to have such a
low end as this, put me into the Priests office, that I may eat a piece of
bread; no we are to seek you, and not yours: and to expect our crown of glory,
at the appearing of the great Shepherd of the sheep, 1 Pet. 5.9.

Fourthly, it must be with faith: and an expectation that God will in a special
manner bless their endeavors and labors unto that people over which God has
put them: over which the holy Ghost has made them overseers: for with the call
of God there does go the blessing of God: and if God do put a man into any
office, he may expect a blessing upon him in that employment: he does call
Christ, and he does promise him, the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his
hand: and Christ sends forth the Apostles, and he promises to be with them to
the end of the world Math. 28.19. the people are to expect a greater blessing
by them because God has put them over them, Heb. 13.17. they watch for your
souls: So the Ministers also that go forth with faith to preach the Gospel, the
Lord will make them a blessing to the people where he sends them.

Fifthly, it must be done as those that give an account for your souls, that
are the people committed to his care, Heb. 13.17. there are great accounts that
men have to give for talents, and opportunities of doing good; and of Riches
that God has entrusted them with, and Honors, and the day of grace: but the
greatest account is that of souls, which are precious unto all those to whom
their own souls are precious: and as the Lord Jesus himself comes in at the
last day before the Father, Here am I and the children that thou have given me,
Heb. 2.13. So also this will be the work of the Ministry at the last day, they
will give an account of your souls: O what a great thing is it for a Minister
to be able to say, I prayed for such a soul: I instructed such a soul; he was
blind before, and God used me as an Instrument to convey light to him: I
watched over such a soul; for it is your souls only that we have to do with
all: and its only with reference to your souls that we watch over you.

Sixthly, the Pastors of a people do their duty, as those whose crown of glory
it will be at the last day, for us to deliver our flock well into the hands of
the great Shepherd at the last day that he has betrusted them with, 1 These.
2.19.20. This is our glory and Crown of rejoicing: yea in the presence of our
Lord Jesus Christ at his coming, etc. to see their graces thrive, their souls
prosper, Christ gloried in it, he sees the Travel of his soul and is satisfied:
and it is a great satisfaction unto poor Ministers in this particular also; and
having given their charge safe into the hands of Christ, they shall then lay
down the burden of their office, and they and their flock shall be made happy
together; and though the particular relation shall cease between them, yet
shall they take more special comfort and communion one with another as Saints
in glory for ever: their relation that they had to each other here, will
sweeten their glory hereafter.

Secondly, Now to make up this Order of the Gospel, also there is a duty that
the Members do owe unto their Pastors that are in this manner chosen by them:
and they are these.

First, it is the peoples duty to pray for them, as those that God sets in
authority over them: if your Pastor prays for you as being over you, you should
also pray for him as being over you.

First, pray for their gifts and abilities, to go through their duty the whole
compass of it. Ephesians. 6.10. and for me, says the Apostle, that utterance may be
given unto me.

Secondly, for their preservation. Romans 15.30. That you strive together in
prayers, that I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judea.

Thirdly, pray that they may have a sanctified use of all their afflictions,
and of all Gods dispensations, Phil. 1.19. I know that this also shall turn to
my salvation through your prayers: when the prayers of Pastor and people meet
together at the Throne of grace each for other, it is exceeding acceptable to
God.

Secondly, honor them in your hearts; let it be answerable to the honor
Christ has given them in the Congregation, 1 These. 5.13. Know them and esteem
them highly in love for their works sake: they are to look upon themselves as
your servants; and to look upon you as the Lords heritage, and that they are
not Lords of the flock: they are not to know in that respect their own honor,
as Moses his face did shine; it was seen of others, but not of himself: but yet
there is an honor that is due from you unto them also.

Thirdly, submit unto them, or be persuaded by them, Heb. 13.17. Attend upon
their ministry, as those from whom you may expect a special blessing; though
it may be they may not have such great parts and gifts as others, yet they are
those that God has set over you; and do you submit to them: though they be in
outward respects far inferior unto you, yet as they are Pastors, so they stand
in Christ's stead; for remember they are so by an Institution; and so
disobedience unto them speaking in the name of Christ, is a disobedience unto
Christ; he that hears you, hears me; and he that despises you, despises me;
it is a very dangerous thing for a people to have their Minister go to God
against them, and bewail the contempt that is put upon them, and say, Lord,
thou have sent me to a rebellious and gain saying people: Christ says to such a
one, Thou shall kick the dust of thy feet against them; it will be easier for
Sodom, then it will be for that man in the day of Judgment.

Fourthly, encourage his labors: strengthen his hands: stand by him, look upon
your selves as concerned in all things that befall him, Phil. 2.26.
Epaphroditus was sick, and they were very sensible of it, though he were absent
from them; and he was willing to venture his life for the Churches service; and
indeed the labor is burdensome, and continual; do what you may to make it easy
to him, that he may undergo it with cheerfulness; For if he give up his account
with grief, it will be unprofitable for you, Heb. 13.17. So if he do his work
with grief also, it will be as unprofitable to you, as uncomfortable to him.

Fifthly, admonish him of what evil so ever you see in him; if he do not walk
with a right foot toward the Gospel: or be negligent in the performing of his
office: say to him, Take heed to thy Ministry, Col. 4.17. It were a misery for
the greatest officer to be exempted from that ordinance of admonition, which is
a mercy to the meanest member: and yet be careful, do not take up every flying
report against him: for there are no men so subject to the scourge of the
Tongue as they are: but God as he will wipe all tears from their eyes, will
also wipe off all blots from their name.

Sixthly, there is a supply which you are to make to their wants, and it is
your duty to administer unto them of your substance, according to your ability,
Gal. 6.6. You must make him partaker of all good things: First you must do it
in obedience as an Ordinance of God. Secondly, it must be given proportionably
to a man's ability, for it must be in all good things. Thirdly, not to think
much of what you give them: if the ministers of the Gospel sow spiritual
things, why should we count it a great matter if we let them reap of our carnal
things? these things which are the truths that the Gospel holds forth, as the
Lord has enabled me, I have endeavored to give every one their portion, both
Pastor and people: what remains further in relation to both, as God gives
opportunity I shall by his assistance set before you: I shall now beg your
prayers that the Lord would teach me how to go in and out before you, that so I
may be given you in mercy and not in Judgment.

Church Officers, According to Institution.
Preached at the Churches choosing of Officers.
HEB. 13.17. Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit your selves: for
they watch for your souls, as they that must give an account, that they may do
it with joy and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.


THE Church of Christ is sometimes called The Tabernacle, Rev. 11.1. etc. And
as in the Tabernacle all was by Institution done according to a pattern, both
Ordinances, and Officers, so it must be in the Church of God the spiritual
Tabernacle of God amongst men, 1 Cor. 12.4,5,6. There are three things that are
by the Lord exceedingly differenced in the Church: first there are (...), all
have not the same gifts, but the Lord divides them according as he will
Secondly, (...), there are diversities of Offices: all the members in a Church
have not one and the same office, or ministry, or labor. Thirdly, there are
(...), different effects of those offices and gifts: men labor in them with a
different fruit and success: Some more, and some less, according as the Lord is
pleased to use them or bless them: and as suitable to the Churches necessities;
so he does give gifts, so he^ does give Officers also: for no men are to
minister in the things of God, without a call from God: therefore such
Ordinances, and Officers as the Church does stand in need of, he has
appointed: and with these they ought to rest satisfied, and to fancy or create
no more to themselves: which was the error of the first Churches when they
began to degenerate and corrupt themselves; when they brought in new
Ordinances, then did they begin to set up new officers immediately: and they
that will lay aside the Ordinances of God, will bring in multitudes of their
own, as we see it in Israel, they multiplied their Idols: and also they that
will lay aside the Officers of Christ, wilmultiply Officers of their own.

Ambrose says of the Church of God at first, Amb^ose.
It did nothing without the approbation of certain Elders thereunto appointed;
but that being neglected, doctorum desidia, vel potius superbia, dum soli
voluerunt aliquid videri, now they brought in all manner of new Officers to the
great burden of the Church that under Popery they are as much burdened with
officers as they are with Ordinances: therefore it must be our care to have an
eye to the pattern in the one as well as the other: for what ever is not of the
Lords appointment, that he will neither own, nor bless; it is of such that
Christ speaks of in Ioh, Every plant that my Heavenly Father has not planted
shall be rooted up: it is those that did place themselves in Offices in the
Church, never planted by the Father. Here are in the words two things. First
the Officers duty, and that is, first to rule, and then to watch. Secondly, the
object or subject of this authority, it is not over the bodies and estates of
men, but their souls only. Thirdly, the great engagement and obligation that
lies upon them so to do, because they must give an account. Fourthly, here are
the different accounts that Church Officers will give to God, and that is some
with joy, and some with grief. Secondly, here is the duty of the people that
are under their power. First, they are to obey. Secondly, to submit themselves.
Thirdly, upon this ground, because they are such as watch for their souls, and
must give an account. Fourthly, as knowing if it be with grief, it will be
unprofitable unto them. And hence there are several propositions very useful to
our present occasion, which I will set down in their order. First, that the
Lord Christ as head of the Church, has appointed that there shall be Officers
in all the Churches: there is as well an Institution of Officers and offices,
as there is of Ordinances; and it is in a man's power to constitute the one no
more then he may the other: and the neglect of one, is a neglect of the
Institution, and so of the authority of Christ, as well as the other; it will
appear that there has gone some great hands unto this, and to manifest this
appointment.

First Christ, Ephesians. 4.11. it is counted there as one of his gifts, which Christ
gave upon his Ascension: for he does not only say that he gave the gifts that
qualified men for that work; and that is a mercy when the Church is enriched
with gifts, and the Lord does pour out his spirit upon many of them, that they
be fitted for office if they be called to it, 1 Cor. 1.7. 2. in a Commonwealth
though there be but a few Magistrates, yet there be many that are fitted to be
Magistrates: as in an Army when the soldiers are valiant, yet its not
expedient that every one is able to command a party, or be an Officer, etc. But
it is not the gifts only, but the Officers also that Christ has given his
Church, and they are to be looked upon as a special gift of Christ, as a
special fruit of his taking possession of the Kingdom, when he sat down at his
Fathers right hand; and though they were all given for the gathering and the
perfecting of the Saints, yet some were but temporary, others were to abide to
the end of the world, till all the Saints were gathered and perfected; and
therefore it is said that he has set them in his Church, 1 Cor. 12.28. (...),
the word notes a constitution, a firm stablishment, that cannot be changed,
Act. 17. the times and seasons which the Father has put in his own power,
(...), by a firm appointment and decree, etc. 1 These 5.9. God has not
appointed us to wrath, but to attain salvation: its the same word. So that the
word signifies to appoint by a firm and a sure decree, which cannot be changed;
he has set them there, and therefore none shall or can remove them.

Secondly, the Holy Ghost he also has a hand in this Constitution, Acts 20.28.
Over whom the Holy Ghost has made you overseers; it is spoken unto Officers
when they meet with the Apostles, etc. and for the understanding of it, we must
consider, That the Spirit is the Mediatory Kingdom has undertaken to be as it
were a Prorex, to rule for Christ: therefore, before the Throne there are seven
Lamps of fire, that is, the seven spirits of God, Rev. 4.5. for in the gifts
and graces the Spirit is given, the Gospel its Preached by the Holy Ghost sent
down from heaven, etc. Now there are two things mainly that the Holy Ghost does
in this constitution.

First, the Spirit does gift the men, and qualify them for the work; for
though there be diversity of gifts, yet it is the same spirit that works in
every man even as he will: to one man the gifts of wisdom, to another the word
of knowledge, but by the same spirit, 1 Cor. 12.7,8,9,11. that as before
Bezaleel and Aholiab did set upon the work of the Tabernacle, he was filled
with all wisdom by the spirit of God, understanding and knowledge in all manner
of work-man-ship: and when Saul was called unto the Kingdom, the spirit of the
Lord came upon him, and he was turned into another man, 1 Samuel 10. Whether we
do look unto the providential, or spiritual Kingdom, it is now in the hands of
the Spirit, and he knowing what works he has to accomplish in both, he does
gift men for the work in which he will employ them: for though the gifts be
common, yet they proceed from the spirit as well as graces.

Secondly, when a man is gifted, and by the furniture of the man there is a
ground to conceive God has done it that he may employ him, yet it is not
enough by and by for any man to say, I am gifted, and therefore I will employ
my self; but there is another work of the spirit, and that is, he does stir up
the hearts of men, to choose men, and to call them forth unto the works whom he
has gifted, and qualified for it: and this drawing out of the spirits of men,
in that way that the Lord would have them, is a special work of the spirit of
God, 1 Samuel 10.26. God having gifted Saul, he does draw out the spirits of men
to call him to the office of a King, and to join with him in it, whose heart
God had touched; and the finger of God, is the spirit of God, by whom the
hearts of men are touched: and therefore Zach. 4.6,7. Not by power and might,
but by my Spirit, that is, his spirit that is working upon the spirits of men,
both in instruments, and opposites, raising and elevating the one, and subduing
the other: so that the spirit inclining and ordering, and overruling of the
hearts of men in such a work, it is an evident testimony of a call from the
spirit; for their hearts God had touched, etc.

Thirdly, there is yet something more, and that is persons being thus chosen,
there is a sanction, and a stablishment from the Holy Ghost, that does come
upon them: that as all the duties of the office lie upon their consciences, by
the command of God, that whatsoever is required in that office, the Lord
expects it of them; so all the honor and dignity of the office is due to them,
and that by a command from the Holy Ghost: and men are to be subject for
conscience sake, as an act of obedience unto God; as a wowan before she has
chose a husband is at liberty to marry whom she will, only in the Lord; but
having once chosen a husband, all the duties that belong to a husband, she is
to perform unto him, by virtue of the Covenant of God, and in obedience unto
God: and as it is with a people in the point of the Magistracy, its true that
civil government is appointed by God; but that it shall be in this or in that
form, he has not appointed: and therefore though there be several forms of
government, yet all are lawful, and may according to the rules of prudence be
made use of in any state, as shall be most for the public good: therefore all
forms of civil government are called, (...), 1 Pet. 2.13. but having made
choice of Magistracy in what form so ever, the authority of God then comes upon
it, and ye are to obey as unto God, and to be subject for conscience sake, Romans
13.5. and so it is here also; and upon these three grounds it is that the
Holy Ghost is brought in for the Constitution and establishment of
Church Officers; and therefore it is that he has set, (...). Act. 20.28. He
did constitute them in that particular place where they should be.

Thirdly, for this cause the Apostles they took special care to set up all the
Institutions of Christ, as well offices as ordinances: as the state and
condition of the Church did require, and therefore they did not only gather
them into bodies, but they did also set Officers over them: Acts 2.14,23. They
ordained Elders in every Church, and the same charge and employment they gave
to the Evangelists, who were appointed to this purpose, to confirm the
Churches, and to ordain Officers in every Church.

Fourthly, and we see that all the Churches of Christ accepted of Officers, and
acknowledged them as such; as there were Elders in the Church of Ephesus, Acts
20.28. and the Church of Jerusalem had not only Apostles but Elders also, Acts
15.2,22 and therefore the whole Church is brought under these two heads, them
that rule over you, and all the Saints, Heb. 13.24. They are not all Rulers,
all are not men in office, there be Rulers that are distinguished from Saints.

To what end are officers appointed in the Church? what need is there of them?
they are appointed by Christ for these ends: First for the Churches perfection,
in the Constitution thereof: for though a Church without officers be a true
Church in respect of the Essence of it, when there is a society of visible
Saints, united into one body by mutual consent, in the profession of the faith
of the Gospel, as appears Acts 6. there was a Church at Jerusalem, before there
were Deacons: and a Church at Antioch, before there were Elders, Acts 14.23.
but yet it is nor a complete Church in all the parts of it, as an Organical
body: therefore it has officers superadded, and therefore as soon as the
Apostle had converted a people to the faith, first they did embody them, and
then for their perfection they set officers over them: they did not look upon
them as complete, whilst they were as sheep without a Shepherd: till there be
some to rule, and to order them in the ways of a Church, and according to the
Institutions of Christ: and therefore in all ages the officers have been in a
special manner the glory of the Churches, as the Apostles were, Rev. 12.1. Upon
their heads is a Crown of twelve stars: and therefore Cant. 8.8. We have a
little Sister, and she has no breasts, that is a stablished ministry, and
settled officers, from whom the sincere milk of the word might be sucked:
breasts of consolation, whereby they might be supported: Now this tends to the
perfection of a Church, as we see it described, Ezekiel. 16.7,8. Thy breasts were
fashioned, and thy hair was grown: it notes coming unto maturity, and ripeness
of age: whereas a Church wanting officers, is but a little sister yet in her
infancy or minority, etc.

Secondly, Officers are appointed in the Church, to avoid confusion; therefore
the Lord saw officers to be necessary, 1 Cor. 14.33. God is not the author of
Confusion but of Peace, in all the Churches of the Saints: and Col. 1.2.5.
rejoicing and beholding your order, according unto Gods order, when every man
keeps his place, and rank: that is, they that rule keep their place, and they
that are to be subject keep their place: for the Greek word (...), is a
military term: and if either of these be wanting, there will be confusion in
the Church: therefore he will have some to rule, and others to obey, that there
may be no disorder: and by this means no differences: for its disorder that is
the ground of all differences, as it is order that is the ground of peace:
break order in a Church, and you break the peace of it immediately.

Thirdly, the Lord does it for the Churches edification: that as he does give
diversity of gifts, and all of them to profit withal, 1 Cor. 12.7. It is not
that any of them should lie idle, and be used barely for a man's self, and his
own advantage, as an ornament to himself, but for the good of the Church; so
the Lord does also appoint diversities of administrations to officers in the
Church, that according unto men's gifts, so they may have suitable employments
in the Church, in which they may increase their gifts, and thereby having
public occasions, they may be more publicly useful, then otherwise ever their
gifts could have been, had they continued only as private Christians: therefore
the Lord having gifted men, and thereby fitted them for the public good, he
does give unto them a call unto a public office, that thereby they may have
opportunity to exercise these gifts, that he has given them: which else in a
private condition must needs in a great measure lie idle, the man wanting
opportunity to draw them forth as in an office he may do, and thereby improve
them: so then officers there are by the appointment of Christ, and we may not
neglect them least we despise any institution, and least we run into confusion,
and be enemies to our own perfection and edification; and therefore it is a
great fault in some Christians that they are without them; sometimes they are
without a Preaching Officer, sometimes they are without Ruling Officers, and
all upon some curiosities: they cannot have a man so qualified as they desire,
a man that has eminent gifts, or a great name, an honorable repute: there is
a great deal of pride and vanity that men do manifest even in such things as
these are, that are spiritual pride: as men glory in officers, in Paul, in
Apollo, etc. They are said to be puffed up one against another, 1 Cor. 4.6.
that is, they were puffed up for their Teachers, and they grow proud, and
boast, one against another, because we have higher and more eminent officers
then you: therefore they despise one another, and so they were in their
boastings and glorying carnal: there is a great deal of pride and vanity in
men's glorying in them carnally, when they have them; and its manifested in
many, that because their pride this way cannot be satisfied, therefore they
will choose rather to be without them.

Secondly, These officers have an office: there is an employment, and a power
which is put into their hands by Christ, for the good of the Church: we read in
Scripture of the power of the keys, Math. 16.18. which is an Ensin of
Authority, put for the Authority it self: as to give a man a sword, is to put
the power, of the sword into his hand: to commit authority to him, of which
this is the Ensign: and so it notes a Commission given by Christ, unto some
persons to rule in his house, according to the order, and the rules prescribed
in the word: and this power in Scripture is threefold: First it is Monarchical
in respect of Christ the head: Secondly, it is Democratical in respect of the
body of believers. Thirdly, Aristocratical in respect of the officers: So Dr.
Whitaker, p. 2. page 519. there is a threefold power that belongs unto the
members of a Church; first a power of admission of members, and of ejection of
them: therefore the people are taxed, that they did not cast out the man; there
is a virtus expulsiva belongs to the body, 1 Cor. 5.13. Take away from amongst
you that wicked person: and the same is the Judgment of Peter Martyr, loc.
com. p. 886. sect. 9, 10. where he does peremptorily deny, Absque Ecclesiae
consensu quempiam excommunicari posse, etc. and if so, ejusdem potestatis, the
same power that can cast out, they only can admit; for if the officers may
admit without the body, they may cast out without them also. Secondly, there is
a power of Election, they have a power given them by Christ to choose their own
Officers, that the Apostles would not interpose, but Acts 6. the Church do
choose their Deacons, choose out amongst your selves. Thirdly, there is a power
also of admonition, Math. 18.15. Take two or three with thee and admonish them;
and it is an authorative act, for it is in a way of process, after a private
admonition has been refused; and if there were not such a power given unto the
Church, then, First if Officers abuse their power, they have no remedy against
them, they must lie under it for ever; the Church having power to withdraw from
any particular man, may also do the same to an Officer. Secondly, then that
Officer is without any remedy himself, and he has not the privilege of the
meanest member; for if excomunication be an Ordinance, and is for edification,
and to reclaim, if an officer go astray and persevere in it, it is a misery to
be deprived of it; but yet there is a power and authority that belongs to the
Officers, which must not be entrenched upon by the Community; as to preach the
word, administer the seals, observe the ways of the Church, to visit the sick,
etc. These are the acts of the Elders, which the whole Congregation are not to
meddle withal: and though it is true that a private Christian may watch over
his brother, and visit the sick, they are to do it, yet he does it not as an
act of office, but of brotherly love and Christianity only: and there is a
great deal of difference: as it is one thing for a man to give an alms, and
another thing as a Deacon, to communicate to the Necessities of the Saints, as
every one has need; the Church may choose the Deacon, but they cannot execute
the office of a Deacon: they must not give all of them their own alms, because
it is not the way into which Christ has put it: there is a great deal of
difference between these two, as it will appear in this; we pray one for
another ex charitate ut fratres, non ex officio ut mediatores: out of Love, not
out of office. It is very different to do the same thing as a brother, and as
an officer: these two powers must be kept distinct, that as the Church must not
meddle with the authority and power of the officers, so neither must the
officers ingross and take to themselves the whole power of the Church; for in
the primitive times it was not so.

Now these Officers have a power committed to them; they are as the Churches
servants, and so they are to acknowledge themselves: We preach our selves your
servants for Christ's sake: and they are to manage it with all humility:
therefore not as Lords over Gods heritage, for all is for the good of the
Church, and so the Angels are ministering Spirits, because it is for the good of
the Church, though the greatest power and authority under Christ, is committed
unto them, in ordering of all things here below: but yet there is an authority
committed unto them by Christ, 2 Cor. 10.8. there is an (...), an authority
given them, for edification of the body, etc. though to keep in, and cast out,
belong to the body, yet they have a special hand in it, and the managing of all
the business of the body belongs to them wholly, and therefore the names that
they have, do note a great deal of power, and great authority, they are not
only called (...), 1 These. 5.13. men set before other men, and exalted above
them: for in Church societies, it is not outward honors, or wealth that exalts
men; men may be great men, yet have but mean gifts, and of little honor and
esteem in the Church of God: but also they are called by terms of authority,
they are (...), in this place, and v. 7. they are your Guides, Leaders and
Commanders: and therefore, -- it is taken from the Master or Pilot in a Ship,
that turns it about to steer it in its right course, and therefore they were of
old called The Masters of Assemblies, Eccl. 12. and this appears so much the
greater, if you do consider also that they speak to you in the name of Christ:
for 1 These. 5.12. They are over you in the Lord; and what they do require by
virtue of their office, they can do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ; as
an Ambassador has great power because he speaks in the name of the King: and
they can enjoin you as you owe obedience to Christ, in whose name we speak, and
whose work we do: therefore he that rejects you rejects me, 1 Cor. 5.4. In
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ deliver such a man to Satan: if they did it
in their own name, there were little power in it indeed, but in the name of
Christ there is great authority: and there is this the more to be added,
because as it is a power given them by Christ, and Christ is despised in them,
so it is a power given them by your own consent: now for a man to give consent
to put power into a man's hand, and afterward he denies him the exercise of
that power which he has given him, it is for a man to Judge and condemn
himself in the thing which he himself allows: therefore it lays a necessity
upon you of subjection to this power, both for conscience sake, and as a thing
that was done by your own free election and consent: and so there is not only
an authority that commands it, but a Law of love also: as a woman subjects her
self to her husband, not only as God has commanded it, and given him authority
over her, but also from a principle of love, because this is the man that I did
choose to my self to obey, and to be subject unto all my days: therefore a
double Law is broken in this respect: and this still argues the greatness of an
Officers power in the Church: Its called the power of the keys, which does
note a very great authority and office; Isa. 22.22. power in the house, the
ordering of governing of all the affairs in a family, shall go through their
hands: as it is said of Joseph, what ever was done in all the land of Egypt, he
was the doer of it; so it is true of them, what ever is done in the Church of
God, it must go through their hands, they must also be the doers of it: and
Math. 16.19. it is the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, which is meant both of
grace, and glory, a power to bind and loose in the Church, by virtue of the
Institution of Christ and what they do bind and loose, or they remit or retain,
shall be so done in the world to come, in the Kingdom of Heaven: so that they
shall open Heaven to the Church, and if they shut them out, heaven shall be
shut out: if they bind upon their consciences, so will the Lord also in the
world to come in Heaven: and in this respect, it is a far greater power, then
if a man had the keys of the authority and Government of all the Kingdoms of
the Earth.

Thirdly, the subjects of this authority, it is not the bodies, lives of men,
or their estates, but the authority is spiritual, and it relates unto the soul
only and this will appear: First because it is managed only by spiritual means:
as the Kingdom of Christ is not of this world, the management of things in the
Church of Christ are not to be done in the way of the world; it is not by any
outward power and greatness, or by authority and force of arms, etc. but all is
ordered by the word, 2 Cor. 10.5. The weapons of our warfare are mighty through
God; for it is this that is the Scepter of the power of Christ, and all the
authority that he does exercise by his Ministers, and Officers under him, it is
by the word only; and if they will not hear the word, let such a man be unto
thee a Heathen man, let him be Anathema Maranatha to the coming of the Lord: we
must leave him as a man incurable: we can do no more to him, 1 Cor. 16.22. if
the word will not reclaim him, we have no way to deal with him, but to set
before him the Judgment that is written, which if he despise, then
Church Officers have no more to do, but as they when they refused the Gospel,
did shake off the dust of their feet: it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah
in the day of Judgment: they have no power either to imprison, or afflict
their bodies, or seize upon their estates, if they obey not: they can only
leave men to the Judgment of the Lord. Secondly, answerable unto the power,
such are the censures, and they are all spiritual, they relate unto the soul:
they can inflict no corporal punishment upon men, but the Punishment in
Scripture, and first a binding of their sins, Joh. 20.21. as they pardon sin in
the conscience and in regard of their Church State by receiving them after
sinning upon their repentance; So there is a binding of sin upon the
conscience, convincing a man of the guilt of sin, and also the putting him out
of the society, so that the man's sin is bound in his own conscience, and before
the Church, and the Lord says, It shall be bound in heaven, and shall not be
pardoned to him; or if he be godly, he shall not have the sense of pardon till
by this ordinance of Christ he be again received.

Secondly, they withdraw communion with him, 2 These. 3.14. If any man obey not
our word, note that man, and have no fellowship with him, that he may be
ashamed; all this is in reference to the soul, that the man may be reclaimed;
it is only, Mingle not with him, that when he shall see all godly men to avoid
him as a Pest, and his communion as some filthyness, he may thereby take shame
to himself.

Thirdly, deliver him to Satan, 1 Cor. 5.4,5. Ordinances are means to inflict
spiritual Judgments, as well as to convey spiritual Blessings: cast him out by
a Judicial act from the Assemblies of the Saints; and so being cast out, he is
in the world where Satan rules: he shall have nothing to do with Ordinances
more; and yet all this is with special respect unto his soul: it is for the
destruction of the flesh, that the soul may be saved in the day of the Lord;
therefore all power is for the good of the soul, that is committed to the
Officers of the Church.

Thirdly, all their power is for spiritual ends, all with relation to the soul:
First, for preservation, they do watch over them, that they be not deceived
with corrupt Doctrines, lest being led away with the error of the wicked, they
should fall from their stedfastness; and because Wolves will come in, watch
therefore, take heed to your selves and to all the flock, Act. 20.30. and also
lest they be corrupted in their practices, for a little leaven will leaven a
whole lump, therefore Church Officers are made watchmen to discover the danger
that is coming upon them, and to prevent it.

Secondly, for their edification, therefore S Paul says, The power was given
for edification; that he had authority in the Church, it was that he might have
the greater opportunity to edify the Church of God: and 1 These. 5.12. They
labor amongst you, and admonish and instruct you: all is for the edification
of the body of Christ, till we all come to the unity of the faith, and to a
perfect man.

Thirdly, for their salvation; all is done, that the spirit may be saved in the
day of the Lord, 1 Cor. 5.5. and therefore the great care of all the Officers
mentioned in Scripture, has been of the souls of men, and to see their souls
prosper, and their graces thrive; how ever it was with them in outward things,
if they were rich in faith, and abounding in hope, and full of good works,
though it went never so mean with them in outward things, they were not
afflicted with it; and therefore Paul is mightily troubled when they are turned
away from the Truths of the Gospel, and when any of them do walk scandalously,
to the endangering of the souls of the rest of the body, etc.

Fourthly, Officers must give an account of souls that are committed unto them:
Here first, every man must give an account to God for his own soul, and his own
ways, for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ, to this end,
2 Cor. 5.10. Secondly, every man shall give an account of the souls of others,
so far as either they have been under his power, or he has had a hand or been
instrumental in their destruction: as the destruction of Israel will be charged
upon Ieroboham, who made Israel to sin: and Lev. 19.17 Thou shall not bear sin
for him. Ab alienis meis, Austin.
Austin: and it is a terrible thing to be Instrumental in any man's destruction.
Thirdly, but Officers in a special manner, that do take the charge of souls,
they shall give an account for them, that is, according to the terms of the
Prophet, Ezekiel. 3.17,18. If thou give him warning, he shall dye in his sin: the
blood shall be upon his own head, thou have delivered thy own soul: but if thou
do not give him warning, he does perish, but his blood shall be charged upon
thee, it shall be required at thy hands: it is the guilt of blood that is the
greatest guilt, and of all bloods, the blood of souls; yet this is that which
lies upon you, which Erasmus says, Erasmus.
are fulmina non verba; its a terrible thing to consider such a charge upon him
with such a danger: A man that considers what account he has to give of his
own sins, he would not be willing to take upon him also the guilt of other men's
sins, and give account for them. Fourthly, all that are employed by God, there
will come a time when they must come unto God, and deliver up their charge for
the talents that they have received; I had five Talents, here they are, and are
improved to five more: the unprofitable servant must come also, that hid his
Talent in a Napkin, and conscience shall give up its charge, when it lays down
its viatory office, delivering the man up perfectly unto the grace of God; and
Christ the Kingdom (which some (as Chrysostom) do understand of the Church of
the Saints, and that fitly, and truly) unto the Father: I have kept them
through thy name: take them now to thy self, that they may be with me where I
am; and so for a man to lie down in the dust with this account, and to appear
before God with this truth, Of all the souls that thou have given me, this is
my account, that I have brought them unto thee safe: here am I and the children
thou have given me: Fifthly, of all trusts in the world, that of souls is the
greatest: First, it is the great thing in the man, and the man is lost when his
soul is lost: and therefore in one place it is said loose thy soul, and in
another loose thy self; it is eternal destruction, when the soul is lost; it is
more worth then a world: it will not profit a man to gain the world if he loose
his soul. Secondly, it is the great thing that Christ betrusts us with, he does
prize it above all things else; all other Talents that he gives us are but for
the good of the soul; and it was in love to the soul, that Christ did, and
suffered all that he did for poor lost man; it was merely for the redemption of
his soul, the great thing that Christ has an eye to is the soul, the which he
has most glory, and about which he has laid out most grace. Thirdly, it is
that which Satan does most of all oppose, and desire to destroy: he is indeed
Abadon, he hates all mankind, but his chief aim is at the soul; he is a
murderer, but he will murder the soul if he can: that is it which he does
charge all his volleys at, he cares not for men's estates and for their honors,
it is their souls that is the great thing in his eye, therefore there is
nothing is in so much danger, and there is no such trust committed unto a man
as the souls of men; it is a greater trust then to have the charge of all the
Kingdoms of the world. Sixthly, surely then they had need know the souls well
that are under their charge, they had need of a very exact account of them, and
to keep an account of them, that shall give this account before Christ at the
last day; and therefore all that are heedless in this office, and that for low
and poor ends undertake such a charge, and are negligent, and are wanting in
that labor and diligence in it, it does plainly argue, that men do judge the
account of souls to be but a small thing, and that which may be easily passed
over; and truly as he that has no care of his own soul, will never take care
of an others, so he that makes no matter of giving up an account to Christ of
his own soul, it is no wonder if it be a small thing to him if he had the
burden of all other men's souls upon him also: but he to whom the account of his
own soul is dreadful, he that has known the terror of the Lord in himself, it
is a terrible thing unto him to give an account of other men's souls also.
Fifthly, there is a different account that Officers will give at the last day,
some will give an account with joy, and some with grief: there is a double
connection. First, they watch for your souls, obey that they may do their work
with comfort, watch for your souls with comfort. Secondly, that they may give
up their account with joy; for the obedience of a people is a ground of both;
the greatest joy of a faithful Minister of God is in this, which was the great
satisfaction of Christ, Isa. 53.10. To see the Travel of his soul: the joy of
harvest is the greatest joy; one sows and another reaps; to receive the fruit
of a man's labor, is as it were reaping it brings great joy, 1 These. 3.8. Now
we live if you stand fast; the great comfort of our lives comes in by it; for
it is a comfortable living to see the souls of men committed to our charge
prosper, 1 These. 2.19. Ye are our glory and joy, our Crown of rejoicing in the
presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, at his coming; ye are our glory and joy;
next unto a man's interest in Christ, and the joy that he has at his
appearance, are the souls that he has brought unto him: on the contrary what
they do, if the people profit not, they do it, (...) suspirantes: its true,
that there shall be no sorrow of the Saints at the last day: for there shall be
no more sighing; ou^ tears shall be all wiped away, but yet there will be
something that will be even matter of sorrow to them.

First, that they have lost their labor, Isa. 49.45. I have labored in vain,
and the labor of the officers is great, it is the greatest labor, 1 These.
5.12. it is (...), wearisom cutting labor, and to look upon all this as lost
in reference to the main end of it, is a grievous thing.

Secondly, that the souls of the people are lost, which was the greatest care,
that they should dye in their sins, though their blood be not required a^ their
hands; Oh it is sad: for there is a great love in the Officers that are
faithful unto the souls of the people: and they ought to walk in a high degree
of love toward them; now to see those souls lost for whom I put up so many
prayers, and about whom I took so much pains; it is grieving the Spirit of God
to see men turn his grace into wantonness, Ephesians. 4.30. And it will also
exceedingly grieve them that are acted by the same Spirit.

Thirdly that I should be instrumental in their Condemnation, and be a means to
heighten it: for it will be casier for Sodom in that day; and the greater means
men have had, the greater will their condemnation be; the greater pains any
Minister has taken with a people, the greater will their Judgment be; they
that have been exalted up to heaven, shall be brought down to Hell, and in the
day of Revelation, when the secrets of God as well as the hearts of men shall
be made manifest, it shall appear how Ordinances did ripen sins, and how God
did make use of them to pour out spiritual Judgments by them: the greatest
curses come out of Sion, as well as the greatest blessings.

Fourthly, that I should be brought in as a witness against them at the last
day: Satan shall be the accuser; but there will be three very dreadful
witnesses against them. First, Christ: then shall the King say, etc. Secondly,
Conscience: a man's own thoughts will accuse him in the day that God shall judge
the secrets of men. Thirdly, the Ministers, when they that have been laboring
for their good all their life time, shall witness against them. There is one
that accuses you, even Moses in whom you trust; when a man shall bring in his
accusation against a disobedient and a rebellious people, Mark 6.11. Shake off
the dust of your feet for a testimony against them; it will be easier for Sodom
and Gomorrah, then for them, etc.

Sixthly, From all that has been opened we may plainly by way of use gather,
what manner of men Church Officers ought to be: First, they must be gifted: and
it is this must be the ground of the Churches choice: for as grace fits a man
for communion with God, so do gifts fit a man for the edification of the
Church: and who ever is chosen that is not gifted, was never appointed by
Christ; for the Holy Ghost does gift men, before he does set them over any
people: therefore you are not to look only at the grace, but at the gists of
Officers: every godly man is not fit for an office. Secondly, they must be
humble men: for they have a power put into their hands, and an honor put upon
them: now it will be a snare to a proud man to be in honor, and he will never
use power well that is not humble: the great care of officers should be that
they might so walk as not to Lord it over Gods heritage: they must not exercise
a Lord-like authority, but carry themselves in all manner of meekness and
humility, or else it is dangerous to put such a snare upon them: it is a
temptation for them to be in place. Thirdly, they must also be holy men, such
as have a care of their own souls, and rightly judge of the price of a soul;
for they that have no care of their own souls, will never have a care of yours.
Fourthly, they must be faithful men, that is faithful in labor: Laying out
themselves to the utmost without any respect to themselves, or to their own
ease: for the business which they are to do, concerns souls, and they must be
faithful in their account, those that shall do all things that their office
requires of them upon this consideration, that we must give an account for the
souls that are committed to us: it is not an account unto the Church that will
serve, but our account must be unto him that shall Judge quick and dead.
Fifthly, he must be a man eminent in holiness, for he must be a Leader: Now
there are many Saints that are not fit to lead: their Officers are to walk
holily before them, that they may follow their example; and he must also be
courageous, or else he will never dare venture in dangers, to go before them,
and if he be not so, he will be a man apt to mis-lead and pervert; there is
nothing more dangerous then to have a man of great parts and eminent place in
the Church, if he be a leader in an evil way: men will be ready to follow him:
and therefore above all take heed of this, that he be a man eminent in holiness
and of an exemplary conversation. Sixthly, that he be well known and acquainted
with you, etc. if he have not all these qualifications, see the evil of it in
these particulars; I will but name them. First, you abuse a Gospel-priviledge, a
power of Election that is put into your hands. Secondly, in the end you will
find the misery of it by putting your selves into the power of men, who shall
not use their power for your edification, but for their own honor and
advantage, making Church Power to serve their pride and lusts, which has been
the common abuse of it in all ages of the Church.

Communion with GOD, Good in Bad Times.
Preached at Paul's, October. 14. 1647. before the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen.
PSALM. 73. ver. the last; the former part. But it is good for me to draw near
to God.


WHen dangers are eminent, all men begin to look out for a refuge, that they
may be able to make a certain and an honorable retreat: that they may in an
universal deluge provide an Ark; in a common conflagration, a Zoar: and in a
common Shipwreck that they may have tabulam post naufragium, that they may have
something, that when danger has done its worst, they may be able to lift up
their heads and say, Terram video: I yet see an Haven to anchor in; I yet see
an Haven to make to a safe harbor. All natural and unregenerate men, they have
their refuges to which they retreat: the rich man's wealth is his strong Tower:
and his high wall is his own conceit. But the Holy Ghost has told us, that
when God shall lay judgment to the line, and righteousness to the Plumet, the
hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the storm shall overflow their
hiding place, Isa. 28.17. But a godly man he has his refuge also: grace makes
a man partaker of the divine nature, (...), as Athen. Nazianzen expresses it:
it does wholly resolve the creature into God: God is to him allin all. God is
his provision, for he is a Sun. His protection is from him, for he is a Shield.
His perfection lies in him: for he himself is his exceeding great reward. Thus
the name of the Lord is a strong Tower, and the righteous fly thither and are
safe; when the Branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low: specially if
we consider the time into which God has cast us. As I know there is no duty,
so I know not of any Doctrine more necessary then for the people of God, those
that have an interest in him, to be stirred up at this time in a special manner
to keep close to him, that they may put on David's resolution in the Text, It is
good for me to draw near to God.

In this Psalm you shall find David lie under a great affliction, and a great
temptation: an affliction, for he says, that he was plagued every day, and
chastened every morning: and the temptation rose from his observation of the
contrary prosperity of the wicked. Here was a dispensation of Providence that
David could notunderstand; here was a Temptation of Satan, that David could not
overcome; thereupon he goes into the Sanctuary of God. Truly, whatsoever men
may think, the holiest men, and the ablest men will sometimes stand in need of
the Ministry of the word: David went into the Sanctuary of God, and then the
passage of Providence was clear to him, his mind was quiet, there is a
pacifying virtue in the word, and the temptation vanished: and this the Lord
did by discovering unto David the ground of this differencing dispensations in
outward things, in regard of the different Covenants under which men stand; and
that both toward unregenerate men, and toward his own people: Toward
unregenerate men, the Lord in his Sanctuary did discover to David these Three
things;

First of all, their outward prosperity was but like a dream, but an Image, an
appearance an outside, (...), and does please men no longer then while they are
asleep: it was but as a dream, when a man waketh, that all their outward
prosperity would certainly die.

Secondly, the Lord discovered to him, all this glory should end in their utter
destruction in time; and that this Jordan of content did but carry them down to
the dead Sea; the Lord will say, they had their portion in this life: Son,
remember that in thy life time thou had thy good things.

In the third place; the Lord discovered to him, that this common love should
end in an eternal hatred: so in these outward mercies there was a judgment:
their Table was made a snare, and to ripen their sins, and by this means
highten their judgment; and so all the prosperity of the wicked to be an act
of wrath, and not of mercy; and the Lord did advance them, that they stand upon
slippery places. In all Gods dispensations toward unregenerate men there is a
judgment, even in those things that are mercies: outward blessings in
themselves, but curses to the men; because this is a rule, Sine summo bono nil
bonum: there is nothing good to a man that has not an interest in God that is
the chiefest good. These things being discovered unto David, he understood the
end of these men; but in the Sanctuary also God taught David something of his
own people; and they were these three things.

First, that notwithstanding their sufferings. yet they had Gods presence in
them: though the Lord be present with his people at all times, yet especially
in the worst times: when the Bush is in the fire, then in an especial manner is
the good pleasure of him that dwells in the Bush there: Thou art with me (says
David) thou hold me with thy right hand. And as he had Gods presence: So he
learned in the Sanctuary, that they had Gods guidance: as he did not bear the
affliction alone by his own power, so he did not go through it with his own
wisdom: thou shall guide me with thy counsel. And,

Lastly, he had Gods glory; for these light afflictions work for us a more
exceeding excessive eternal weight of glory: thou shall guide me with thy
counsel, and afterward receive me to glory: and this sowing in tears shall
make way for a joyful harvest. Now David having understood these things in the
Sanctuary, hence he begins again to lay claim to God, and that he had made the
best choice. Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and who do I desire upon earth in
comparison of thee? surely it is good for me to draw near to God. Thus Gods
people are gainers by all their afflictions, and they grow the stronger by all
their temptations: This being the Connection, The Observation then that I shall
desire to handle without any division of the words, is plainly in the Text.

Doctrine.
In evil times it is good for the people of God to draw near to God: The best
course a godly man can take in calamitious times, is to keep close to God.

In the handling of this truth, there are two things that I shall desire to
clear for Explication, and then we shall come to Application.

First, I desire to show you what it is for a man to draw near to God; by sin
every man he is departed from God; the first design of sin is to draw a man
away, 1 Iam. 14. (...), and the further a man goes in a way of sinning, the
further he does depart from God. Inde 18. and all the lustings of their heart
are ungodly lusts. In this respect it is said, the Prodigal went into a far
Country. Ephesians. 2.17. Now there is by reason of sin a double distance of enmity
and estrangement; The Apostle in Col. 1.21. puts them both together: We are
strangers and enemies in our minds through evil works: now answerable to this
double distance, so must our returning to God be: there must be a returning by
reconciliation to take away your enmity: and by Communion, to take away your
estrangement: for Christ's business is, to bring us back unto God again, 1 Pet.
3.18

First, for Reconciliation, that is not in Scripture called drawing near so
much as being made near, Ephesians. 2.17. You are made near that were a far off, by
the blood of Christ: so that by Reconciliation a man is put into a state of
neerness and proquinquity. That is the first thing whereby the creature returns
to God; but now being made near, being put into a state of union, then

Secondly, The soul comes to draw near, that is, the estrangement must be
removed, which is done by communion, to exercise acts of communion; observe it
I pray. I say a man must first be put into a state of neerness, and made near,
before ever he can exercise acts of communion, and then draw near. Now this
drawing near, is for a soul to come to God from day to day, to improve his
interest in him, grow into more and more acquaintance and familiarity with him:
and you shall find, that when a man is once brought into a state of union, then
the Lord calls him always unto fellowship. Open unto me my Love, my Sister,
and my Spouse: there are continual knockings of the Lord as for a further
entrance; there is a principle in us always drawing back to perdition: and you
shall find that there is a Spirit within always calling to draw near unto God:
the Bride says come, and the Spirit says come: the Spirit in the Bride. There
is a great deal of distance between God and the best of the Saints; for 2 Cor.
5. while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. So Ignatius
of old, he says, Aqua viva in me intrinsecus dicit, veni ad Patrem: that there
was a living voice within him, that always called upon him. And I beseech you
consider, a soul that is once put into a state of communion, and has tasted
what it is to draw near to God, he desires a daily communion, he is never near
enough, he does continually set it as a seal upon the heart. When a man is once
by reconciliation put into a state of neerness; then in all Ordinances, in all
ways of obedience, in his exercise of all graces, the soul is said to draw
near; that is, to act, and increase his fellowship and communion with God. This
I conceive to be the meaning of that expression, Ioh 22.21. Acquaint thy self
with God and be at peace, so goodness shall come unto thee: acquaint thy self
with him, (...) assuesce te cum illo; it is in the Hebrew, and is rendered by
some, accustom thy self to be with him: a daily commerce with God, and an
accustoming of a man's self with fellowship and communion with him; this is
properly to draw near. So that as Reconciliation takes away your enmity, so
communion takes away your estrangement.

But you will say to me, Can a creature draw near to God? if you look upon man
in his natural distance, God is in heaven, you are upon earth: can there be a
drawing near between finite and infinite? cna finite and infinite have
fellowship? nay, look upon man in his moral distance, as a sinner, and so, can
there be agreement between light and darkness? can righteousness and
unrighteousness have fellowship? Surely, God is a consuming fire: and who can
dwell, who can engage his heart to draw near to him? Now give me leave (I
beseech you) to clear this to you, by proposing to you this consideration.

There is a twofold state of a sinner. There are some sinners that are in a
state of estrangement unto God: and whosoever you be that are here present, the
enmity of whose nature is not yet taken away, and destroyed by a work of
Reconciliation: I say to you, whatsoever you be, you cannot draw near to God:
you may have communion with duties, you may pray, you may hear, but you can
never have fellowship with God in those duties, and that upon a double ground.

First, because the enmity of your nature remains; and two cannot walk together
unless they be agreed: and surely the nearer such a soul comes to God in any
duty wherein Gods people approach to him, the more God is provoked against him,
and the more he is estranged from him: a strange expression, that of the
Prophet, I saw him in Gilgal, and there I held my peace; Gilgal was the place
of worship: the nearer any man comes, the more a man's heart rises against him,
and the more enmity does increase: I saw him in Gilgal, and there I held my
peace: you cannot draw near to God, the enmity of your natures still remains.
You cannot draw near to God also

Secondly, because you have another society: your fellowship is with unfruitful
works of darkness; and the fellowship, the amity, and love of the world, is
enmity unto God. I remember, Augustine complains concerning himself in the
days of his unregenerate condition, speaking of the pride of the lusts of his
Spirit: Ecce, hi sunt amici quibus consului, quibus credidi: these were the
companions that I conversed with, these were my friends, and these were my
Counselors. Now, my Beloved, whosoever he be that has Communion with the
unfruitful works of darkness, it is no wonder if that man cannot draw near to
God. I have told you already, and I desire you would lay it to heart, you must
be made near, or else you can never draw near: you must be in a state of
communion, or else you can never have fellowship with God. That is the first
thing.

But there are a second sort of sinners, that are made near by the blood of
Christ: and these, though God be in heaven, and they are upon earth: though
they be sinners, and the Lord be holiness it self: nay, though they in their
own apprehensions shall say as Hooper once did, Lord thou art Heaven, I am
Hell: yet they may draw near to him, and that upon these six grounds: I beseech
you observe them. A sinner put into a state of communion may upon these grounds
draw near to God.

The first is, Gods electing love: the Lord has separated unto himself the man
that is Godly, Psalm. 4.3. (...), it is in the Hebrew, he has gloriously, and
miraculously, wonderfully, separated to himself into fellowship: not only to
himself for service, but to himself for communion: and what is the ground?
because you are predestined unto followship, (...). My Beloved, when you all
fell from God as well as the Apostate Angels, might not the Lord have left you
in the same condition with them? and your doom should have been cursed, and
therefore cursed, because you must depart; but if the Lord had been pleased to
have been reconciled; if he had said to you as David did concerning Absalom,
bring the young man home, but let him return to his own house, and let him
never see my face: if the Lord should have said, I will not remember their evil
against them to destroy them, but they shall never see my face more, they shall
be estranged to me for ever: you would have said, this had been a mercy, even
your preservation; but this does not satisfy Electing love: there is a double
end that electing-love aims at, 2 Luke 14. it is, peace and good will; not only
Reconciliation, but Communion: that God may take the creature into fellowship
with himself, and empty himself (as I may so speak with reverence) into the
bosom of the creature. Be pleased now to consider, you may then draw near to
God upon this ground of Gods electing love.

Secondly, you may draw near to God, grounded upon the nature of the Covenant
of grace under which you stand. My Beloved, God deals with all mankind in a
Covenant-way; and according unto the Covenant under which he stands, so are
all Gods dispensations toward him: and to that end the Lord has made a double
Covenant with a double head. The first Covenant was made with the first Adam,
the second Covenant with the second Adam; and therefore God looks upon all
mankind, as if there were but two men in the world. 1 Cor. 15.47. The first man
was of the earth earthly: the second man is the Lord from Heaven Heavenly: God
looks upon all mankind as coming under these two heads, the first Adam, and the
second Adam. Now the Covenant of grace which the Lord has established, it has
a double property. First, it is faedus amicitiae, a Covenant of friendship;
the Lord does take Abram as his friend. Abram my friend: James 2.23. Now the
Schoolmen tell us of two sorts of relations; relatio disquiparantiae connotat
dominium: that notes subjection and dominion, as between a King and a subject,
a master and a servant; there is not so properly communion: and relatio
aequiparantiae quae denotat Communionem: now the proper end of friendship, is
fellowship: for a man's friend is as his own soul, and the Covenant of grace is
a Covenant of fellowship and therefore they may draw near unto him, being taken
by God into a Covenant of friendship.

2ly. the Covenant of grace is a matrimonial Covenant: faedus Conjugale: I
betrothed her: in Hos. 2.9. you knowin this is the nearest Communion, and the
surest oneness in this relation beyond al other in the world the greatest
friendship by virtue of an Ordinance two made one. One that was heretofore a
stranger, shall be dearer then Father or Mother, and this voluntary relation by
consent, shall by virtue of the Ordinance of God be more powerful then a
natural relation, and a man shall leave Father and Mother, and cleave to his
wife: and if there be this power in an Ordinance of God that is but civil, what
efficacy shall divine Ordinances and this spiritual Covenant have? Surely, thou
shall lie in his bosom, and have the more intimate and full communion with him
for ever. Now when the Lord will set forth the near Communion that his people
may have with him by this Covenant this he calls a Matrimonial Covenant.

Thirdly, you may draw near to God grounded upon your union with the Lord Jesus
Christ. The Apostle tells us, 1 Cor. 6.17. that he that is joined to the Lord,
is one Spirit: and by that Spriit we have access to the Father, Ephesians. 3.12.
(...), the Apostle tells, that our way to God is through him; we have by Jesus
Christ our manuduction: he is the great Favorite that leads us in by the hand
into the presence of the Father, Ephesians. 2.18. through him we have an entrance to
the Father, by one Spirit. Christ is not only medium reconciliationis, but he
is medium communionis also: by his satisfaction the one; by his intercession
the other: Jesus Christ (my Beloved) has a double reference to us: in the work
of satisfaction, he is the means of Reconciliation: but in all our approaches
unto God, being reconciled, Christ is the medium, he it is by whom we have
Communion with the Lord. Besides,

In the fourth place, you may draw near to God because of your conformity to
him: for we are made partakers of the divine nature, 1 Pet. 1.4. and we live
the life of God, Ephesians. 4.18. and we have his Image restored, 1 Cor. 15.49.
Conformity is the ground of communion wheresoever it is. Joh. 3.6. and the more
Conformity, the more Communion we have: and when your Conformity shall be
perfected, so shall your communion be. Take that place (and it is a choice
Scripture) in that Zach. 3.7. If thou will obey my words, keep my charge, I
will give thee places to walk in among those that stand by; (...) inter stantes
illos: who are these? Those, interpreters conceive to be Angels: So Drusius,
Post mortem anima tua in chorum recipietur, etc. the Angels and the Saints they
are taken into nearest communion. So Calvin; so that the more Conformity there
is, the more a man obeys God; and the more he keeps Gods charges, the more
the Lord will delight to give him places to walk in amongst those that stand
by. Nay,

In the fifth place, you may draw near to God; for though God be in Heaven you
may ascend, and the soul may be above in Heaven when the body is walking here
below: there is a double way of the souls assent: either in contemplation, or
affection. In contemplation, the soul may ascend. John in Rev. 4. said, I saw a
door opened in Heaven, and a voice said, Come up hither: John in his body
ascended not, but John in contemplation of his heart was above, Col. 3 4. A man
is worth as much as his love is worth. Ezekiel, when he was in Babylon by the
River Chebar, yet he says, the Spirit of God carried him in the visions of God
to Jerusalem, Ezekiel. 8.3. in his contemplation at Jerusalem, and yet
notwithstanding in his body in Babylon by the River Chebar: And the soul may
ascend in its affection; Mat. 6.21. Where a man's treasure is, there will his
heart be: and surely where a man's heart is, there is his happiness: and where
his happiness is, there is the man; mira sublimitate transit amor in amatum.
Niremb. Observe it, Augustine says concerning himself, his soul ascended up,
and frequently ran and saluted the Prophets, and visited the Patriarchs, etc.
Anima ascendit frequenter and currit familiariter per plateas coelestis
Jerusalem. Thus (my Beloved) may a man's soul be in heaven, even while his body
is here below, feeding upon the hidden manna, and bathing himself in those
rivers of pleasures, that the Lord has prepared at his right hand for those
that love him; then, though you be upon earth, you may ascend, and therein draw
nigh to God.

In the last place (I must hasten) you may draw near to God; for if you cannot
ascend to God, God will be pleased to come down to you, Isa. 51.15. Heaven is
my Throne, I inhabit eternity, I dwell in the high and holy place, yet will I
dwell with the humble and the contrite heart; Luke 13.15. If the Prodigal do
but say I will go to my Father; the lost Son comes in, the compassionate father
runs: God deals with his people in this, in a way of reatliation; and when a
man has but a motion to return to God, why the Lord is ready to meet him, and
embrace him: he has to this end appointed Ordinances, and in them he tells
you, he will meet you, Exodus 20.24. you need but come half way as it were; God
says, he will meet you. My Beloved, it is true indeed, it is an imperfect, yet
notwithstanding it is a real communion: we do but see him indeed behind a
wall; and through the lattice: but yet we do reasly see. And it is such a
Communion that the Lord is himself exceedingly delighted with; the King is held
in the Galleries; it is that mighty expression of the Spirit, Cant 7.5. the
King is held in the Galleries: there is a double Gallerie wherein Gods people
take their walks with God, he, and they alone: the upper Gallerie is reserved
for the souls of just men made perfect: but there is a lower Gallerie wherein
Gods people walk with him here: Jesus Christ is said so to delight himself in
this converse, that he is held there, and that by nothing, but by the cords of
love; The King is held in the Galleries. Thus then let this serve for the
opening of the first Branch; what it is to draw near to God; and upon what
ground, though God be in Heaven and you upon earth: though God be a consuming
fire, and thou as a sinner, but stubble before him, being put into a state of
communion, thou may draw near to him.

Now let us come to the second Branch of the opening of the Doctrine; and that
is, why it is good for the people of God, yea best for them in calamitous
times, then to draw near, to keep a close and a constant communion with him;
truly the grounds of it are very weighty; take it in these particulars, as
briefly as I am able.

In the first place, this is the only means to preserve a man from the sin of
evil fellow-ship; therefore it is good to draw near to God; you shall always
find times of suffering to be also great times of sinning: and men in them,
they are not Tam miseri quam mali, as Salmon compares them. When God pours out
his wrath, then does Satan pour out his rage: then because iniquity does
abound, the love of many waxes cold, and men prove Apostates and fall away.
Now at such times there is the greatest Apostasies, and backslidings manifested
then at any time: men fall from their former apprehensions into erroneous
opinions: men fall from their former affections, and they lose their first
love. Men fall from their former conversations, and they glory in their shame,
and because iniquity abounds, the love of many waxes cold; and it is not
strange (I beseech you mark it, for I speak to you that fear God, that are put
into a state of Communion, I say it is not strange) that even the Godly should
backslide, and deny, and fall from the glory of their former conversation.
David had his first and his latter ways. It is the expression in Chro. 17.3.
Iehosaphat walked according to the first ways of David his father. A David may
have his first and his latter ways; and in such times as these for a man not
to fall from his stedfastness (my Beloved) it is a mighty thing: when the
Dragons tail shall sweep down the third part of the stars, for you to abide
fixed; there has been in all ages a course of the world: the world is a Sea,
and every man is a drop emptied into that Sea, and he swimeth in it; he is apt
to run with the tide: there is a course of the world, Ephesians. 2.2. and in every
age of the world there is a several form of it: (...), Gal. 1.4. delivered from
the present evil world: that is the redemption of the Saints to be delivered
from the evil world that is present, and that way of wickedness that is common
in their age, etc. Ye shall observe this in the first three hundred years: then
the generality of the world, they were the Dragons Angels that made war against
the woman: but when the woman had brought forth a man-child, and he was
advanced into the Throne of God, into the state of the Empire, then presently
the world becomes Christians. In Constantines time then Satan pours out a
flood after the woman, the flood of the Arrian heresy, and then the world
became an Arrian, Jerome.
totus mundus factus est Arrianus, as Jerome complains. This flood being in some
measure dried up, and afterward settled in the Sea of Rome, then all the world
wonders after Rome: a new Beast arises that had two horns like a Lamb, and
speaks like a Dragon, and reserves all the cruelty of the Dragon, but only
under a more promising, under a more harmless and promising shape; by and by, I
say, all the world wonders after Rome. And thus you shall find men that mind
nothing but earthly things, and that usually that they may enjoy the world,
they are thus carried on by the course of the world, in all ages; (...): Just.
Mart.
Justin Mart. Now what shall preserve us? Oh, there is nothing now but keeping
close to God, that will keep you unspotted: In Genesis 6.9,10. Noah walked with
God; semper incedebat, eratque cum Deo perinde ut homo cum homine amico, Aust.
Aust. The Schoolmen put the question how it comes to pass, that the Angels and
the souls of men in Heaven are impeccant, and without sin. They answer: that it
is the Beatifical vision, they have always God in their eye: visio Beatifica
impotentes reddit ad peccandum: truly, there is nothing in the world that will
stay the soul like to it. If you will be preserved from the evil of the times,
and be upright in a crooked generation, then take heed to walk close with God.
It is good for you to draw near to God. But

Secondly, it is good for you to draw near to God, when all things else
withdraw themselves from you: My Beloved, it is good for a Christian to make
such a supposition as the Prophet Habbakuck does in Chap. 3.17,18. Though the
Fig Tree should notblossom, though there be no fruit in the Vine, though the
labor of the Olive should fail, and the fields should yield no meat: the
flocks should be cut off from the folds, and the Herds from the stalls: yet I
will rejoice in the Lord, and I will triumph in the God of my salvation. Mark,
he does not only pitch upon those comforts that are rather for complement then
necessity, but the choicest provision (as I may so speak) of the worlds making;
here is the Fig Tree, the Vine, the Olive, the Field, the flock: and he says
not, If any of these should fail, then they might be recompensed with the
labor of the other; but if all these should fail together, and conspire to
make man miserable: and not only to fail in hope, but even what you have
already in possession. When does a man think his flocks to be certainer, then
in his folds; and his herds, then in his stalls? but though the flocks, and the
herds should fail; what now will bear up his soul? I will rejoice in God: Oh,
it is time to keep close to God; let me tell you, the Land reels to and fro
like a Drunkard; sometimes leanes this way, you know it, and sometimes that
way: truly, when the Land begins to sink under a man's feet once, foundations
shake, then it is time for a man to lift up his hands, and to take hold of
heaven; restat iter coelo: for this will be the great cut to a man's heart when
he shall be shut out of all things here below, as it was with Saul in his
agony: the Philistines made war against him, and God hides his head; the
Philistines made war: so they did many times before, and Saul got the better;
Saul had now an Army in the field. I, but though he had an Army; Saul had lost
his God, the Lord is departed from me, and answers me no more. This is the best
way indeed to keep close to God, it is time to draw near to God, when all
things else withdraw themselves from you.

Thirdly, it is best, because if you draw near to God, God will certainly draw
near to you: he has promised it, in Jam. 4.8. Draw near to God, and he will
draw near to you: and the approach of God sums up all, Gen 15.1. for in his
presence is fullness of joy. It is a mighty expression, Rev. 21.7. that he that
overcomes shall inherit all things. I, and that of our Savtour, Mark 10.30. If
a man forsake father and mother, house or lands, he shall have a hundred fold
more in this life: a hundred fold in some respect, he cannot have an hundred
Fathers, or an hundred Mothers, but Interpreters say, it is not to be
understood formaliter, but eminenter: he shall have all the comforts in God
that these could afford him, if they were a hundred times more: Oh then draw
near to God, and God will certainly draw near to you. But, I but name things.

Fourthly, to draw near to God is best; for by this means you shall be
preserved from the evil that other men suffer, the evil of suffering: The
promise is in Psalm. 91.10. He that dwells under the shadow of the most high;
no plague shall come nigh him: he will give his Angels charge over thee; it
notes a constant fellowship: thou shall be the special charge that the Angels
have I shall desire you but to consider, the Lord has projects of providence
for his peoples preservation, as well as for his enemies destruction. Noah
walked with God, and had an Ark, when the rest of the world of ungodly men
perished in the waters; David a man that kept constant communion, and we see
how the Lord owns him in all his trials and appears for him: upon all the glory
there shall be a covering; and there are projects of providence beyond the
wisdom of men or Angels; for, the Lord knows how to deliver the just from all
their trouble, and how to reserve the wicked to the day of Judgment. These
things now I am forced to pass over.

Lastly, (and so we will hasten to the Application) It is best for men to draw
near to God, because a close communion keeps up in a man's soul those
qualifications as shall make every afliction comfortable and easy, be the
times never so bad: for the drawing near of the soul to God, is like the Sun to
the earth, which by its heat and perfect influence puts life, vigor, and
beauty into things dead and withered before, Cant. 1.12. Communion with God is
the springtime of all grace: and therefore I will but name them.

First, Communion with God will keep a man's soul in a silent humble frame: that
was the fruit of Aarons Communion in Levit. 10.3. a great cross be fell him, he
lost two Sons taken away by an immediate act of Gods hand, even in an act of
sin; yet Aaron held his peace: Aaron held his peace: fellowship with God will
certainly keep the soul in a peaceable submissive frame, that be the affliction
what it will be, the soul shall say, Gods will is the rule of goodness: when
Judgment was pronounced against Hezekiah, good is the word of the Lord: and
Job, the Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away.

Secondly, fellowship with God will keep a man's soul in a holy independency
upon the things below: there is nothing (my Beloved) puts a man's soul out of
band with the creature like communion: this is the way to have the Moon under
your feet, as the expression is: for that in fellowship with God, a man that
knows what it is to have close communion, knows that he does really set his
feet where other men set their hearts: it puts the mouth out of taste to all
creature comforts to him; Chrysostom (...), Chrysostom.
though the world were on fire about his ears, yet he has lost nothing, for
his portion is enough.

In the third place, as a holy independency, so a holy magnanimity of spirit;
he shall not think those things great that other men think insupportable. Jesus
Christ endured the Cross, and despised the shame; and the shame of the cross
was the greatest suffering. Why do you weep and break my heart? I am ready not
only to be bound, but to die for him. Luther.
And Luther (I remember) when the enemies gave out that he had recanted, he
writes in a Letter of his, that I will never recant: think that I will do any
thing rather then recant, be the dangers and threatenings what they will be;
they are not careful to answer thee in this matter: omnia de me praesumes
praeter fugam, qui odium and impetum totius orbis sustinui: Communion with God
keeps up a man's Spirit in this magnanimity.

Lastly, fellowship with God keeps up a man's soul in a holy self-sufficiency:
if it be in prison, God is his enlargement; a good man is satisfied from
himself, Solomon says; so as he may enjoy God truly, he is able to stand upon
the ruins of the world, and say, that he has lost nothing. August.
I remember it is Augustines expression of the Bishop of Nola. The City was
taken and sacked by the Goths, that he did reason with himself, having lost all
his estate, should he vex himself for the loss of silver and gold? domine, ubi
omnia mea tu scis. Lord, thou know where all my treasure is laid up: there
is a holy self-sufficiency in regard of a man's fellowship with God. Now this
noble disposition, communion with God will always keep alive, and active in
the soul. Let this serve for the Explication of the point. I shall borrow but a
little time for application, I shall not hold you long.

Use.
I would make but one Use of it and no more. To exhort every one to put on
David's resolutions in the times in which you live, It is good for me to draw
near to God: make it your business, to keep close, and constant to him: truly,
I fear many a man in public employments (I beseech you lay it to your own
hearts, I say, I fear many a man) many a godly man in public employments his
heart runs out so much upon the things without him, that he has cause to
complain as the Spouse does, the Church does, they made me keeper of the
Vine-yards, but my own Vine I have not kept. I am afraid, many in public
employments do much remit their private duties. My Beloved, there is a cloud
that hangs over all the Reformed Churches, and we have cause to fear, that the
sword is already bathed in their blood, and that great a consumption is
determined upon them all, whether we consider our fullness of sin, or our
fearlesness of Judgment.

First, fullness of sin; for we have certainly, after pruning brought forth
grapes of Sodom, and clusters of Gomorrah: truly, I know whatsoever we may
suppose of our selves, I know no terms that God offers to creatures but this:
if you will not be chastised of me, I will punish you seven times more, and
seven times more till I have destroyed you: in decretis sapientum nulla est
Litura: And if Gomer begins once to bear, in Hos. 1. (you see the pedigree of
judgment) she will never leave bearing till she has brought forth Loammi,
perfect destruction: therefore if you look to the ful-ness of sin;

Secondly, If you look to the fullness of judgment: truly I may say, (though it
be sad to say it) Ephraim, England, is a silly Dove without a heart; gray haris
are here and there, and she knows it not. Consider (I beseech you) but the
juncture of time into which God has cast us. The time of the Witnesses
prophesying in Sackcloth and ashes draws near to an end, and they do think by
and by to put of their Sackcloth; and so some render that expression, when
they are about to finish their testimony: and they thought they should by and
by have put off their sackcloth and ashes, and have put on the garments of
praise and glory; then comes the killing of the Witnesses This I desire you to
consider; the killing of the Witnesses shall be shortly before Romes ruin,
Rev. 11. When they rise, the tenth part of the City falls, which is whole
Rome: that which now remains being but the tenth part of what it was
anciently, and therefore does syncronize with Rev. 18. Babylon being cast in
the Sea as a mil-stone: We have great reason to expect this to be coming on;
and then who are they that shall escape that great tribulation, such as never
befell the Christian Churches, forrunning their great delivery: that shall
stand with the Lord, with Palms in their hands, as tokens of victory? none but
those that having gone through great tribulation, have washed their garments
white in the blood of the Lamb: and that is immediately before the seventh
Trumpet sounds: and certainly whosoever shall observe both the course of the
History, and the course of Gods dispensation of providence, must needs
conclude, it is not yet come. Now in this consideration, how good is it for to
take this counsel of the Prophet? It is good for a people to draw near to God.

But you will say to me: how should we draw near?

A few directions with a word of Exhortation, and I conclude.

There are these five Rules that I earnestly desire the Lord may write in your
hearts, that you may know how the soul ought to draw near to God.

First, be much in the use of all Ordinances, for in them you do draw near,
Lev. 10.3,4. God will be sanctified in those that come near unto him; you do
draw near in Ordinances: this is the Bed wherein Christ and his Spouse do
solace themselves, and enjoy the sweetest of pleasures: and it is of
flourishing Ordinances that the Holy Ghost speaks when he says in Cant. 1.16.
But yet in all your Ordinances, pray observe to take heed that you do mark the
special presence or absence of God in them; else you may have communion with a
duty, when God withdraws himself: and know, that Gods withdrawing of himself
from an Ordinance is a great judgment, when the glory of the Lord departs:
for then our Ordinances will be Wells without water; Breasts without milk: there
is a vanity in Ordinances as well as in creatures, if God leave them. But as it
is a great judgment; so it is the forerunner of Judgment. Oh that the Lord
would set on that place upon your hearts, Ezekiel. 10.2. the Lord says to the
Angel, Go take fire from off the Altar, and scatter over this City; take fire
from off the Altar. If the glory of the Lord depart from the Temple, then the
fire of the Altar that before would serve to expiate their sins, will now burn
the City, and there is no fire burns so hotly as that which is taken from off
the Altar. Nay, I desire you to take this with you, That as you must use the
Ordinances, and observe the spiritual presence or absence of God in them: See

That your Ordinances be pure Ordinances, or else they will do you no good: See
that they be without humane mixture and sophistication: there is a great deal
of vanity and pride in men: for truly, vain man would be wise, though he be
born like a wild Asses colt, and men love to exercise their wisdom in nothing
more then in the things of God, and therefore for matter of Ordinances they
will pick and choose. I desire you to consider, and you will find this Rule: The
less of Gods Order you have, the less of Gods presence, and the less of Gods
blessing. That is the first Rule for your drawing near. Be much in the use of
all Ordinances. But yet observe the spiritual presence, or absence of God in
them.

Secondly, if you will draw near to God, Walk in a continual fear that God
should withdraw himself from you. That is another Rule of Communion. Truly, all
people that know what belongs to walking with God, and drawing near to him,
know they must be acquainted with such spiritual truths: walk in a continual
fear of Gods withdrawing of himself from you. It was the Churches misery in
Cant. 5. I opened, and my Beloved had withdrawn himself: my Beloved had
withdrawn himself. August.
Augustine I remember speaks of a chaste and of whorish fear, a sinful fear, and
he expresses it by the disposition of a Wife, and a Harlot; both stand in awe
of the Husband, of the man: but (says he) Haec virum timet ne veniat, illa ne
descedat: one fears least the Hushand will come, the other fears least the
Husband will depart; these are the dispositions (certainly) of a soul that
knows what belongs to Communion with God; a man that has once obtained
Communion with God to approach, but afterward the Lord departs, it is
uncertain whether ever he shall obtain that approach of Communion again, or no.
Bernard.
I remember it was Bernards observation (and truly it is a sad one) speaking of
those that did fall from their Communion; says he, Perpaucos invenimus qui
unquam redeunt ad gradum pristinum: we shall find very few of those that ever
obtained their former approach of fellowship again: make this your business,
walk in continual fears least the Lord withdraw himself.

In the third place; If you would grow in Communion, and draw near to God, you
must grow in conformity unto him: for I have told you already, that according
as our Conformity is, so shall our Communion be; so I beseech you observe it in
John 15.10. Christ says to his Disciples, Keep my Commandments (says he) and
abide in my love, as I have kept my Fathers Commandments, and abide in his
love: abide in his love; does our abiding in the love of Christ stand upon our
keeping his Commandments? it is spoken here of abiding in the sense and the
apprehension of his love, walking in the light of his countenance: there is a
double love of Christ unto the Saints: there is amor benevolentiae and amor
complacentiae; there is a love of benovelence, and that is the ground indeed;
it is free grace is the ground of all grace whatsoever: this is not grounded
upon our conformity to Christ, for he loved us when we were enemies. But there
is a love of delight, and that is grounded upon the image of God in us, and our
conformity unto his: and the Lord so much the more delights in the creature,
as he sees the more of his image in it. So then, if you would draw near to God,
grow into conformity, and your communion shall grow.

In the fourth place; Observe the times of fellowship: I beseech you remember
this: There are peculiar times when God draws near to you; mollissima tempora
sandi: do you then draw near to God: call upon him while he is near: that is
the expression: the Spirit of God ( Tertullian observes, Tertullian.
res delicata spiritus Christi) is a delicate thing, a delicate Spirit, easily
provoked to depart when the Lord knocks, and offers love, and men will not
entertain it. Courtiers have their peculiar times of speaking, when they may
have Communion in all their requests with grace: Observe these times, the Lord
thus draws near you; cherish as your life these seasons of times, and these
sweet warblings of the Spirit of grace: observe when God draws near to you.
That is a fourth Direction.

And in the last place, Take heed of all those sins that may interrupt your
fellowship: it is true indeed, every sin separateth between us and God: and the
smallest sin, the smallest body has its shadow: but yet notwithstanding there
are some sins that in a more peculiar manner break a man's Communion, and hinder
a man's comfort. And here let me give you to understand, there is a sin that the
Scripture calls a man's iniquity, the sweet morsel that a man hides under his
tongue, and will not forsake: a man's darling, his minion lust: for as in the
new man though there be all grace wrought in a man's heart, yet there be some
graces that are a man's peculiar excellency, that art more then others. Abrams
peculiar excellency was his faith: in Joseph, his chastity: in Job, his
patience: in David, his spirituality: Now so it is in the old man, though there
be all sins, yet notwithstanding some lusts act more then others: and the
uprightness of a man's heart (as David observes) lies in this; in Psalm. 18.23. I
was upright before thee, and I kept my self from mine iniquity. Now there is no
sin that ingrosseth the heart like to this; therefore there is no sin keeps the
heart so much from Communion with God as this; therefore above all evils, as
you do desire to draw near to God, so take heed above all sins, keep down the
darling corruption: for there is no sin (I say) that ingrosseth the heart so
much: there is no sin that casts so much shame in the face, and takes off the
Spirit in all his approaches to God, as this: Then these be the Rules that I
commend to your consideration, if you would keep close Communion with God. Be
much in the use of all Ordinances, walk in a continual fear least God should
withdraw himself from them. Grow in your conformity, and you shall grow in your
Communion. Observe especially those times when God draws near to you. And in
a special manner take care to keep your selves from your own iniquity.

To enforce this exhortation, take these few considerations:

First, you may draw near to God by reason of the near Relations in which you
stand to him: the great promises of the Gospel be personal promises, I will be
thy God, and give thee my Son and my Spirit. Now when God makes over himself by
Covenant unto the creature, its a great ground of our coming to him: had he
said I will be to thee a Father or a Husband, etc. it would have but carried
with it all the comforts that could have been in such a relation: but when he
says, I will be thy God, that is, tant us quantus est: what ever there is in
God shall be as truly thine for thy good, as it is his for his own glory: my
mercy to pardon thee, my power to perfect thee, my wisdom to direct thee: my
grace to heal thee, my glory to crown thee, and therefore David called him the
God of my mercy, and the God of my life: and your interest in him may be a
great encouragement to you to draw near to him.

Secondly, the more a man draws near to God, the more communion he has with
him, the more he shall be acquainted with the secrets of God: for communion
lies much in imparting of secrets. Abraham is called the friend of God: and he
had gotten such an interest in him, that God can do nothing that he will hide
from Abraham, Genesis 18. And Moses, God will speak to him as a man with his
friend sace to face. 1 Samuel 9.15. The Lord told Samuel in his ear. In this
respect it may be truly said, the secret of the Lord is with them that fear
him: and his Urim and Thumim, with his holy ones; these lean upon the Lords
bosom from day to day, and that is the seat of secrets as well as of love.

Thirdly, the more a man draws near to God, the more acceptable will all his
services be; and therefore the more Moses appeared before God, and stood in the
gap, the more God delighted in him, and he turned away the wrath of God from
his people. Job must pray for his friends, and the Lord will hear him; though
they were godly men, yet they were not contented that it should be only well
with them, but they wrestled with God for others, and God will honor them with
the answer of prayers, for they that draw most near to God, and God draws near
to them, are the men of his good will; God will say unto them, Concerning my
sons, and the works of my hands, command ye me, etc. and therefore Bernard
speaking of such times of Communion, Bernard.
Dulce commercium, sed Breve momentum, says he; when it is so with a man, then
pray for me; cum talis fueris memento mei; for then his prayers will surely
prevail. Moses prays, Exodus 32. Lord pardon them, etc. and God repented of the
evil he thought to have done to his people, etc. My presence shall go before
thee, and I will give thee rest; Lord show me thy glory; Thou can not see my
face and live, but I will cause my goodness to pass before thee: God can in
such approaches unto the soul deny them nothing.

Fourthly, the more a man shall prosper in whatever he does undertake; Joseph
was a successful man in all his undertakings; and the ground of it was, because
the Lord was with him, Genesis 39. last: he kept constant Communion with God: and
so David in all things that he did he prospered, for the Lord was with him, 1 Chronicles. 11.9. Josh. 5. the ground of all Joshua's success in war was, because
the Lord was with him; I know a godly man does prize his services above his
comforts, his work above his wages: as one of the Martyrs said when he came to
dye, Nothing did grieve him more, then that he was now going to a place where
he should be for ever receiving wages, and never do any more work. Now if you
would be employed by God, and would have the Lord to delight to use you, and
prosper you in your undertakings, keep close to him.

Fifthly, the more fellowship you have with God, the more friendship you shall
find among men: Indeed the people of God are commonly the persons that are most
evil spoken of in the world; the evil eyes of vain men are set against them and
they will do what they can, to render them unsavory; and they learn from their
father the Devil, to cast aspersions on them: But yet notwithstanding, they are
the Lords darlings, and are precious in his sight: the world may throw dirt on
them, but it shall not stick or fasten there: and if it be good for them, they
shall be delivered from the strife of evil tongues: and in evil times, when
dangers come, when the enemy encamps the City, God will give them favor in the
sight of their enemies. God gave Joseph favor in the sight of the Keeper of
the prison, Genesis 39.21. and Ier. 3.9,11. Nebuchadnezar gave charge concerning
Jeremiah, a poor man in a danger, when the rest of the great Princes were not
considered: and among the godly, they have the highest place in their hearts:
All my delight is in the Saints, says David. Zach. 8. ten men shall lay hold
of the skirt of a Jew, because God is with him; Communion with God here is the
highest pitch of happiness, next to the beatifical Vision in glory.

Sixthly: Lastly, it is the highest pitch of happiness for any people to have
God for their God: the People of God make this their great Boast, Who is a God
like unto our God? and the nearer they come to God, the more they have of him,
the fuller is their happiness: and they are thereby encouraged, because they
know that God delights in Communion with them: he calls upon them for it: he
proclaims it, to let the world see, that he that is God blessed for ever, will
have his Tabernacle among men: he will walk amongst them, Rev. 21.4. he calls
them Hephzibah, my delight is in them: Communion is the first fruit of
fruition: therefore the people of God should labor for it: every act of
fellowship is the morning star, Rev. 2.21. (...), and does assuredly tell that
the day is approaching: if it be so great a matter to have the first fruits of
glory, what must the possession be? Consider what has been said, and the Lord
give you understanding in all things.

THE SAINTS INHERITANCE.
At Mr Carryl's Church at London Bridge.
1 COR. 3.22. -- Or things to come.


OMitting the Context; The words contain in them, the Inheritance of a
Christian, with the Tenure thereof: The Inheritance is, all things; the Tenure
is, ye are Christ's, and Christ is Gods.

First, the Saints have an Inheritance; Christ is by the Father appointed heir
of all things, Heb. 1.13. As he is the Son, he is haeres natus; as he is the
Mediator, he is haeres constitutus: The one by Generation, which was an act of
his Nature; and the other Designation, which was an act of his Will. Now the
Saints being made Sons by the Sonship of Christ, they are also made coheirs
with him in his Inheritance, Romans 8.17.

And his Inheritance being all things, so must theirs be.

There are two things in Christ to be distinguished.

First, (...), a price paid, and thereby a satisfaction given unto provoked
Justice; and so Christ did fulfill the righteousness of the Law, and paid the
curse thereof.

Secondly, there is Meritum, which is a purchase made as it was performed by a
person that was not bound unto the Law. The Law indeed required it of Men, but
not of him that was God and Man; and so the excellency of the person is the
ground of the Merit, and of the Purchase, and the Inheritance; for though it be
true, Meritum Christi habet in se gratiam invisceratam, there is the free grace
of God in all the merit of Christ: Yet there is nothing that is so pure grace,
but that there is a purchase also therein: That the Father may be truly said to
give it, and Christ truly said to purchase it also. And this Inheritance is as
full and large as could be desired; for it is all things, Rev. 21.7. He that
ouercomes shall inherit all things: All things are yours; (...): our gifts are
benefits given for your good. It Is said of Christ, Psalm 86. That God has put
all things under his feet, that is, has given all things into his power and
dominion; In potestate tradere, so as all shall be his servants at his command,
and their utmost end shall be his glory, and so he has put all things under
the feet of the Saints; they are all subjected to them as their servants; so
that the highest end, next unto the glory of Christ, is for their good; All
things shall work together for their good, (...).

First, all things are for their use. 2 Cor. 6.10. As having nothing, and yet
possessing all things. So that though the Saints do not ingross all things unto
themselves by way of a Monopoly, yet as far as their necessity shall require
they may expect the use and the service of them all; so that whatsoever
extraordinary experiment any of the ancient Saints have had of the service of
the creatures when they have needed them, that they also may expect, as their
exigencies and necessities shall require: The Heavens to rain bread, and Rocks
to give water, and the Sun to stand still, and the Moon to go badk; for the
Saints are the Lords of all the creatures, and all things shall be for their
use, because they have an interest in him that is the Lord of Hosts. Fidelibus
est totus mundus. Aug.


Secondly, all things are the Saints for their comfort, and they can taste a
goodness, and a sweetness in them all; 1 Timothy 6.17. He gives us all things
richly to enjoy, (...): And indeed in this respect, we must only, mundo uti
and frui Deo; for he is only to be the rest and delight of the soul: So the
Schoolmen tell us, fruitio est finis.
In the utmost end attained, we have the greatest comfort that a soul can be
capable of; it is noblissima voluntatis actio, and so as Heb. 11.25. Enjoy the
pleasures of sin: Other pleasures enjoyed, become pleasures of sin; all
creatures enjoyed, become the baits and the snares to sin; but here, fruition,
as one has well observed, signifies nothing else but cum laetitia rem aliquam
perci pere, and so God has given a godly man the creatures, and all things,
that he may take comfort in them: And this is the Saints portion, that they may
have all these things as a Viaticum in their way to heaven: Though their
happiness lies not in these things; these things are not the peculiar gifts of
God to them; even unregenerate men may have the creatures; For God gives the
Kingdoms of the earth to the basest of men, but they have no comfort in them;
they have only the sting, the gall and the wormwood that is in them, all his
days he eats his meat in darkness, Eccles. And he has sorrow with his
dainties.

Thirdly, a godly man has a spiritual fruit and benefit by them; all of them
tend to his blessing, and to the prosperity of his inward man: They are scala
caeli, and the soul climbs to heaven by them, as it is said of King Jehoshahat,
2 Chronicles. 17.5,6.
he had riches and honor in abundance, and his heart was encouraged in the
ways of the Lord, etc. whereas to other men their Table becomes a snare to
their soul; it is to them as lime to their wings, that they cannot ascend up to
heaven: They are pondus, the weight that keeps the soul grovelling here below:
There Is a double evil befallen the creatures since that curse came upon them,
Genesis 3.17. it is deceiving, and it is defiling.

1. They deceive; they are themselves empty, yet raise men's expectations from
them: He that depends on them, seeds on ashes, Isa. 44.20. and comes under the
Serpents curse, Dust shall thou eat: and when he depends most thereon, is as he
that worshippeth an Idol, who has a lie in his right hand.

2. They defile; Tit. 1.15. to the unclean all things are unclean. Now in the
covenant that the Lord made with the creatures, Hos. 2.19,20, etc. God promises
not only that they shall not be hurting, but that they shall not be poluting
to the souls of the people of God Grace shall make advantage by them all, and
they shall all of them work together unto a man's spiritual good, that the soul
shall shine, and prosper by them.

Fourthly they shall all of them have an influence into eternity, and all of
them shall add to a man's eternal account, and a man shall have the fruit of
them in his eternal inheritance; A man makes friends of the unrighteous Mammon,
and therein makes himself bags that wax not old, Luke 12.23. and thereby lays
up a good foundation for time to come, that he may lay hold of eternal life;
for we are but Stewards of what we enjoy, and we must one day give an account
answerable to the improvement of those Talents committed to us by God, such
will our honor be at the last, thou have been faithful in the Mammon of
unrighteousness, and therefore the Lord will not fail to give unto thee the
true Treasure.

Secondly, the Tenure is, ye are Christ's; for we hold all in Capite, all by
virtue of Union; Omnes communio fundatur in unione; our communion with him is
in his graces, in his privileges, in his victories, in his sufferings, in his
inheritance, etc. But what is the ground of it? It Is from our union. It Is the
highest glory of a man, next the glory of God, that such a glorious creature as
a woman should be made for his comfort and service; for the man was not created
for the woman, but the woman for the man: So the highest glory of God is
Christ, as God-Man, that he should become subject to him: That he that was the
Lord of the Law, should be made under the Law; he that was God equal with the
Fother, 2 Cor. 11.3,4.
and thought it no robbery so to be. So Christ holds his right to all things
from God, and we hold ours from Christ by virtue of union with him.

There is a double dominion; There is dominium politicum, and that is grounded
upon the providential Kingdom, that Christ as the Lord has bestowed upon him
by God all the services of the creatures; for he has bought all the creatures,
even all the world of God; not only the Saints, but ungodly men also; for,
there are some deny the Lord that bought them. But he buys them not all alike;
but some as servants, others as sons, some their persons, and others their
services only; and as servants he does give unto them a reward; and they have
a right to it, but its only a right of Providence, as they are servants: But
now there is another right, which is dominium Evangelicum, a right as sons, as
they be pledges of a man's eternal inheritance, and flow from a Fathers love, a
right of the promise: and so its only union with Christ that gives such a
right; fundatur in gratia, and can belong to none but unto the Saints; for, its
the Covenant that is the ground of all our claim unto any of the creatures in a
spiritual sense; for that is the root and the center of all the promises; and
its our union with Christ that brings us under the Covenant, and therefore
makes us heirs of all the promises; and by this means the Inheritance of the
Saints is theirs, because, they are Christ's, and Christ is Gods.

We have here also an Inventory of the Saints, a particular enumeration of this
all things, etc.

That which I am engaged in at present, is this (things to come.)

Man being a creature both prudent, and provident, cannot be satisfied that
it is well with him for the present, but his mind is taken up about what shall
be hereafter, and concerning either the good, or evil things to come; does
raise up to himself vast hopes or fears; for in both these the soul goes out to
things to come: The soul is apt to say, I know how it is with me for the
present, but my mind is taken up with what shall be hereafter; my Mountain may
prove but a mountain of snow, it may melt; what changes there may be I know
not: All things here are compared to Wheels, Ezekiel. 1. that which was upmost one
minute, is down the next; Wheels are in perpetuo motu, in perpetual motion;
sometimes compared to the sea, Dan. 7.3. which is in perpetuo fluxu, in a
continual flowing, and therefore how it may be with me hereafrer, I know not:
Now to secure the soul against any distractions for the future, the Lord
assures the soul of things to come: Job.
The thing that I feared is come upon me: I had not rest, neither was I quiet,
and yet trouble came. The heads of men are apt to frame strange suppositions to
it self; and indeed it is a man's duty so to do in reference to a preparation,
that so evil do not come upon him unawares; for, mala praevisa minus sentimus:
Though as it is matter of dejection, it is a man's sin: Hab. 3.18.
Though the Fig Tree should not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the Vines;
the labor of the olives shall fail, etc. Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, etc.
Psalm 46.1.
Though the earth be moved, and the mountains be cast into the depths of the
sea. What if the Sun be darkened, and if the Stars fall from Heaven? What if the
foundations be cast down? We know how things are for the present, and what our
Inheritance in them is, but what if the face of things change? What may be my
Inheritance for time to come, and in things to come, I know not: Therefore the
Lord assures the Saints, that they have not only a present Inheritance, but
also in things to come, that they are theirs also: Things to come are yours.

Doctrine.
The Saints of God have an Inheritance in things to come; Things to come are
yours. For the proof of it.

First, God has made over unto them things to come. The substance of all the
promises, is things to come, whether they do refer unto the life that now is,
or that which shall be hereafter; 1 Timothy 4.8. Now, the Saints Inherit the
promises, Heb. 6.12. The Word of God is in scripture sometimes compared unto a
Traveling woman, and there is a time of the birth of the threatening, and of
the promise: Zeph. 2.1,2,3. It is (...) which is decretum scriptum and
promulgatum,, non occultum, etc.
The threatening, traveling with Judgment to come; and the promises,
traveling with Mercies to come; and therefore Acts 7.17. We read of the time
of the promises, that is, when the children are come to the birth, Isa. 37.3.
Both Promises and Threatenings lie in the womb of the purpose, and appointment
of God a long time, but there is a birth time; and then the Vision will speak,
and not lie, it will come, and will not tarry. And sometimes it is compared
unto one in pursuit of another, Zach. 1.6. Did not my word overtake your
Fathers, Psalm 140.11. Evil shall hunt the wicked. (...)
It Is a metaphor taken from beasts for which men lay snares, and then hunt
them, that they may be driven into those snares, and so take them. There is a
pursuit of the threatening of God upon ungodly men; and there is also a pursuit
of the promises of God upon the Saints.

Secondly, upon this ground it is that the Saints are the only men that have
hope, and therefore they are called the prisoners of hope in the greatest
calamity that is upon them, Zach. 9.12. Those that have not only a hope in
this life, but in that also which is to come. Ungodly men do fancy unto
themselves hope, but its but kindling a fire of their own, Isa. 50.11. and they
compass themselves about with their own sparks, when they lie down in sorrow:
It Is not a living hope, it dies with the man; but the Saints are begotten to a
lively hope, 1 Pet. 1.3. Now hope is conversant about things to come, as fear
is; but the one about good things to come, as the other is about evil things;
there is this difference between. Faith and Hope, in eying of the promise,
Faith gives a kind of (...), and presentiality unto the thing in the promise,
and looks upon it as present, though they be things not seen, Heb. 11.1.

But hope looks upon it in the thing; and that looks upon it as to come: now if
things to come were not theirs, there were no ground of the hope of the Saints,
they were altogether vain hopes.

3. The Saints of God assure themselves it shall be well with them in reference
to things to come, Psalm. 23. last verse. Surely Mercy and Truth shall follow me
all my days. (...)
The word does signify, to follow one; sammo studio and diligentia, etc. it is
the same word that is used Ps. 34.15. Seek peace and pursue it: Mercy shall be
to them as the Rock that followed them, 1 Cor. 10. not only to releeve them at
the present, but also for time to come; and therefore in the lowest condition,
the Church of God do promise themselves that the Lord will appear for them;
they have yet an interest in things to come: The Lord will not hide his Face
for ever, Mich. 7,7,8. Psalm. 94.5.
I will look to the Lord, and I will wait for the God of my Salvation, my God
will hear me Rejoice not against me O mine Enemy: when I fall, I shall rise:
When I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me, etc. He was in an
afflicted condition: He went mourning all the day long for the oppression of
his enemies: and the Lord hid his Face, And his soul was dejected within him;
but yet he had hope in God: For I shall yet praise him who is the health of my
Countenance, and my God: The Saints do comfort themselves in their saddest
condition, with their Interest in things to come; that the Lord will wait on
them, and be gracious, and will not keep his anger for ever.

Consider these Eight things.
Secondly, But how shall things to come become the Saints? In respect of good
and evil things to come.

1. They are delivered from temptations to come: A man shall be delivered from
them, and not left unto them; and there is a great deal of mercy in the
preventing grace of God this way, in being freed from temptations: The Lord
will not lead his People through the Land of the Philistines, Exodus
though it was the nearest way to the Land of Canaan, lest the people see it,
and their hearts turn back again into Egypt, etc. And indeed, the Lord does
strangely order things in his Providence, that temptations may be hid from his
Peoples Eyes. Satan desires continually to winnow the Saints; but the Lord
rebukes him and all his temptations.

2. If Temptations sometimes assault them, yet he does make provision for them
against Temptation: Satan has desired to winnow thee, says our Lord to Peter;
Luke 23.31.
but I have prayed for thee: The Lord lays in consolation for the future trials
of the Saints; and as the Temptation was fore-appointed, so also is the
Consolation, Jer. 10.11. When the children of Israel were in Babylon, and
should have temptations to worship other Gods, they were bid to make this
Answer. The Gods that have not made the Heavens and the Earth, shall perish
from the Earth, and from under these Heavens: And it is very observable, that
one Answer God puts into their mouths, is wrote in the Chaldee Tongue, etc. So
the Saints shall be able to withstand them by virtue of the Intercession of
Christ, etc.

3. Afflictions to come, either they shall be delivered from them, as Hezekiah;
thou shall, says God, be gathered into thy grave in peace: God had an Ark for
Noah, and a Grave for Methusalah: The Flood was appointed to come upon all the
Earth, well, at the time appointed it comes: But first, Methusalah must be
delivered, for he lived until that very Year the Flood came, and God provides
him a Grave; takes him away from the evil to come: him does God deliver from
it: But Noah he must abide the trial; for him God provides an Ark, and safely
carries him through it, Isa. 4.5. Upon all the glory there shall be a defense:
The great water Floods shall not come nigh unto thee; or else, if they be
afflicted, they shall be graciously supported under them: The grace of God
shall be sufficient; for he has promised, When thou go through the fire, I
will be with thee, Isai. 43.2.

There is gratia perveniens and assisteus, in suffering, as well as in sins and
duties. Psalm. 43.46. We will not fear, though the earth be removed; for there
is a River, the streams whereof shall make glad the City of God.

4. Mercies to come to the Saints shall prove Mercies indeed: Saul has a
Kingdom as well as David, but it was a mercy to David, and therefore the Lord
did qualify him for it, and gave him Kingly graces, and weaned hii soul from
the Mercy before he had; Bernard.
Bern. Ecce paratum est cor meum; vis me constituere pastorem ovium, aut regem
populorum: My heart is as a weaned child, Psalm. 131.2,3. And therefore it is
said, Isa. 30.18. that the Lord waits to be gracious; he does not defer because
he is unwilling to bestow mercies upon us, but because we are not prepared to
receive Mercy; for Mercies to unprepared souls, are like unto Cordials unto
foul stomachs, the which do but increase the peccant humors; and therefore the
Lord never gives them till the season of them, and till he has prepared the
soul to receive them. There is a double right that the people of God have to
Mercy. First, there is jus haereditarium, a right of Inheritance, and that they
have as soon as they are converted; but yet they are but then as a child in its
nonage. Secondly, there is a jus aptitudinarium, a right of fitness that is
wanting; and the Lord does not give any Mercy, in Mercy, till both be found in
the soul; till there is a right of fitness as well as an hereditary right.

Fifthly, Sins to come. If God leaves under any temptation, that we are foiled
by it (as that the best of Gods people may; for I know no sin but may overtake
such but final impenitency, and the sin against the Holy Ghost) yet all things
shall work together for good to them that fear God. Et si omnia, qui ni etiam
peccata; Aug.
Aug. If all things, then sin it self is not excluded. God makes a strange use
of sin, to his peoples good and benefit; either to discover unto a man what is
in his heart, and so to abate his carnal confidence, as the Lord did let
Hezekiah fall to that end, that the work of Mortification may be perfected, and
the Sword of Godly sorrow may go the wider, and the Plough of Repentance the
deeper; and that shall be the fruit of it, that the man may be more vile in his
own sight; or else to make him the more instrumental in that kind to do good
unto others, being able to comfort them with the same consolation with which he
himself was comforted of God: And being himself converted, he may be the better
able to convert, and strengthen the brethren, Luke 22.32. And the Saints of God
do see great Mercy even in their sins to come, as well as in their suffering;
that as some of the Ancients have blessed God for the Falls of the Saints,
those Horrenda naufragia; by reason of the comfort, and support, and
admonitions that they had from them: So they do see cause many times to bless
God for that Grace that brings so much good out of their sins also; and so much
they may promise themselves from a principle of Faith, in regard of sinning as
well as suffering.

Sixthly, in respect of the happy and glorious condition of the Church that is
promised in the latter days; there is a time coming, when all the kingdoms of
the earth shall become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Christ. Rev.
11.16,17. and unto the holy people of the most high, Dan 17.27. And when the
smoke out of the Temple shall vantsh, and the Temple shall be opened in heaven,
and a man may see into the Court of the Testament which is within the vayl. The
darkness of the pre^ent dispensation of God shall be done away; and new
Jerusalem shall come down from God out of heaven. When that Sea of glass Rev.
15.2. shall be pure as Crystal, as it was in the Primitive times; now mingled
with fire of contention and disaffection, then shall Jehovah be one, and his
name one. These promises are all for the Saints; if they dye, and never see
them fulfilled, yet they dye in the Faith of them, Heb. 11.13. and Rev. 3. I
will write upon him, the name of the City of my God, new Jerusa^em: That when
the Lord shall reckon up his people at the last day, and put every man with
those of his own rank, all they that dyed in the faith of it shall be reckoned
as truly to belong thereunto, as they that lived in the time thereof that
enjoyed it.

Seventhly, in reference to the destruction of the Enemies of the Church: Rev.
14.
The Lord Jesus Christ has a Winepresse to tread, and a Vintage to gather.
It Is the Winepress of the fierce wrath of God, who is almighty, when the blood
shall be up to the briales of the horses, etc. which is in the times of the
third Angel, and it has a more special and peculiar aspect upon the times in
which we live; then the Saints shall rejoice when they see the vengeance and
wrath of God upon the ungodly; and they shall sing Hallelujah, praise, and
glory, and honor be unto thee (O Lord) for thou have judged the great whore,
and avenged the blood of thy Saints, etc. Rev. 19.2.

Eighthly, the glory of Heaven is to come, but the Saints do rejoice here in
the hope of it, and do bathe themselves in th^se Rivers of pleasures which
shall be for evermore, etc. By this hope, Anima ascendit frequenter, and currit
plateas caelest is Jerusalem. By this do they see God in a fiducial, though
not in the beatifical vision. And a man having this hope he does purify
himself that he way be made a meet partaker of the blessed hope that is set
before him. So that all things to come do make for the good of the Saints;
surely things to come are theirs.

But what are the grounds of the interest that the people of God have in things
to come? Consider these five.

First, the Lord has ordered his eternal decrees concerning things to come; so
that they shall not only make for his own glory, but also for the good of his
people; Ephesians. 1.11.
for he does work all things according to the counsel of his own will. He did
not only from all eternity choose his peoples eternal estates, and choose them
to glory, but he has a decree that passes upon all things to come, in the
government of this world, as may conduce unto this end, and as may further this
great decree and grand design of God: For though in the decrees of God, some
Divines do observe, that there are not priora and posteriora, because they are
eternal, and in aeternitate non est prius and posterius, yet there are
subordinata, one thing may be subordinated to another, as the means are to the
end; for he has chosen us to glory and virtue, the one as the end, the other
as the means, 2 Pet. 1.3. And so the grand design of God, is the glory, and
eternal good of all the Saints; and he has subordinated all things in the
government of the whole creation of God unto this great and principal end, all
things to come shall work together for their good.

Secondly, it is for their sakes, that he has committed the world unto the
government of Christ; Isa. 9.8.
for it is by their Covenant that the world stands; and it is for their sakes
that he has undertaken the Government of the world, Ephesians. 1. last. He has
made him the head over all things to the Church. Christ is not a head over all
things, as he is the head of the Church. He is a head of guidance unto all
things; but he is a head of influence unto the Church also; and he did
undertake the government of all things for the Elect sake, That he might gather
them all together under one head, even in him, Ephesians. 1.10. And he that does rule
all things for their sakes, they need not fear but he will overruled all things
for their good; and therefore all things which are in the government of Christ
do belong wholly unto the good of the Saints.

Thirdly, hence Christ does exercise a peculiar providence over his own people;
which is a great mercy. There is a common providence which does extend unto the
meanest creatures; not a sparrow does fall to the ground, not a hair from off
your head, without it. But there is a special providence over all the Saints,
he is the Savior of all men, but especially of them that believe. 1 Timothy 4.10.
It Is spoken of a temporal salvation, and there is a special providence over
the Saints in reference to temporal things: Yet how apt are the people pie of
God many times to distrust the providence of God even in these: O ye of little
Faith, are you not much better then many sparrows, etc. Consider but the
projects of this providence for the Saints good in reference unto things to
come; it is exceeding remarkable how they have been overshaddowed by a special
providence, whilst they live in this world: When the Saints shall come to
Heaven, and shall understand all the dealings of God toward them whilst they
lived here below, and the grounds thereof, that they may give God the glory of
it. Suarez.
Beatus in Deo videt res omnes accommodas ad se pertinentes, and omnes
circumstantias accommodatas, Suarez. Then when all things shall be opened and
laid together, then it will appear how gloriously God watched over them for
their good by all, things to come.

Fourthly, hence it is, that in the oeconomical Kingdom of Christ the Angels
have their government, and they do order things to come strangely for the
Saints good; for though no creature can know things to come of themselves, yet
by Revelation they do; for they receive from Christ, Rev. 19.10.
a spirit of Prophecy, and they are employed as Officers under him in the
government of all things, Ezekiel. 1. The spirit of the living creatures is in the
wheels, and that was the Angels, chap. 10.20. and ver. 19. When the living
creatures went, the wheels went by them, and when they were lifted up, the
wheels were lifted up; for the spirit of the living creatures is in the wheels:
and this is, because they are sent forth as Ministering spirits for the good of
the Elect, Heb. 1.14. And when Christ gives up his kingdom to the Father, he
will put down theirs; for he will put down all rule, and all authority, and
power, for they were made principalities and powers, only under the kingdom of
Christ; and so long their principality shall last, and no longer, as we see
Dan. 10.20. I go forth and fight against the King of Persia, and then the
Prince of Grecia shall come, etc.

Fifthly, God has subjected things to come unto the prayers of his people, and
thereby joined them, as it were in the same commission with his Son, the Lord
Christ, in the government of the world: Isa. 45.11. Ask me concerning things to
come, concerning my sons, and concerning the works of my hands command you me,
etc.

There are two things that the providence of God is extended to; and they are
either matters of common providence, and they are concerning the works of his
hands: And also matters Ecclesiastical, which concern his Church, and all
things to come; concerning both, he has subjected unto the prayers of his
people, and therefore ye that are the Lords remembrancers, keep not silence:
And therefore Revel. 4.5. it is said, out of the Throne proceeded thunder, and
lightning, and voices: Out of the prayers of his people are the great Mercies
and Judgments; the great turns of the world are brought about and
accomplished by this, the Saints working together with God; and therefore at
the last day, when the causes of all things shall be laid open, it will appear,
all these great things that are dispenst either in a way of Mercy, or in a way
of Judgment, were attained by Prayer.

Use of exhortation.
Exercise Faith about things to come; for this promise, that things to come are
the Saints, as it is a ground of Faith, so also it should be a ground of Hope,
and a rule of Prayer: Therefore let me exhort you in the name of the Lord, be
not sinfully dejected about things to come. I would not have you ignorant of
the signs of the times, nor secure: I would have you know the Judgment of your
God; for he that is wise shall know times and judgment; but yet I would not
have you distrust, and walk dejectedly; for what if the Witnesses be not yet
slain? that ultima clades ad huc metuenda? What if the Enemies of God prevail
once more, to ripen them for their greatest and final ruin? What if such a
temptation should befall a poor soul, that he thinks he should not be able to
withstand? What if I be left by God unto such a sin? What if such a miscry and
calamity should befall me, that GOD should take away my Friend, which is as my
own soul? and such a Relation that I took comfort in? etc. What will become of
the Church of GOD? What will become of the Ordinances of GOD? What will become
of my Posterity when I am gone, now the Enemy is sowing Tares amongst the
Wheat? I have Friends few; where can a man find a faithful man? Let these be
the Queries of ungodly men, whose enjoyments are only present, and have no
ground of hope for time to come.

I should have given you a few directions; I can now only name two or three.

First, Roll thy self upon the promise, Psalm 10.14. Jerem. 49.11. Leave thy
fatherless children with me.

Secondly, the same Fountain of Love and Goodness that was extended to the
Saints of old, is extended also to thee. There Is Mercy for the future as well
as at present: As Faith will purify the heart, so also it will pacify it,
that it shall not be afraid of evil tidings: But the consideration of the
great Goodness of God will support the spirit of a man in any calamity
whatsoever.

THE GREAT DAY.
At a private Fast.
JER. 30.7. Alas! for that day is great, etc.


GOD has subjected all the works of his Providence unto the Prayers of the
Saints; ^sa. 45.11.
and therefore though we are met hereupon a particular occasion, and that
private, yet I hope it is with general intentions to seek God for the Public
also: Which persuasion put me upon the choice of this Scripture, at this time.
I shall not detain you in the Context, though there may be many weighty
observations drawn from thence.

The words are, the words of the Lord; Verse 5.
we have heard a voice of trembling, and not of peace; and is there a voice of
trembling unto Jehovah, at whose presence the earth trembles, and before whom
the everlasting hills do bow?

There is a double apprehension of the speech.

First, that the Lord speaks it in the person of his people, as taking part
with them, being affected after the manner of men: as it is said, Isaiah.
In all their afslictions he was afflicted: So in their trembling, he may be
said to travel also, to show that he was like affected toward them.

2. The Lord speaks in the Person of his People, reproving them, and
instructing them: reproving them, that though the Lord says, we heard a voice
of trembling, socordiam exprobrat: It was in it self a voice of trembling, but
the people trembled not: I and the people that foresaw the calamity; yet they
were so unwise as not to tremble: A wise man foresees the evil, and he
trembles; all that were wise hearted did tremble, but the generality of the
people did not tremble; and to instruct them the Lord directs them what they
should say, and how they should be affected with the calamities that were
coming upon them: We have heard a voice of trembling, and the Lord would at the
last extort that acknowledgment and confession from them, how secure and
senceless so ever they were under his present hand: and when they were brought
into the sense of it, they should cry out, Alas! for the day is great, etc.

Here is first Jacobs Affliction: It Is the time of Jacobs trouble.

Secondly, His Consolation; But he shall be saved out of it: Here first we are
to consider what is meant by Jacob: Jacob is commonly put for all the Tribes,
they being all called by their Fathers Name, sometimes Jacob, and sometimes
Israel. We see it put so, Mich. 1.5. For the Transgression of Jacob is all
this, and for the sin of Israel: Deuteronomy. 32.9.
What is the Transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria, etc? The Lords portion
is his People; Jacob is the Lot of his Inheritance; But Israel was before these
times carried into Captivity, and God had by Salmanasar, removed them out of
his sight; only Judah did yet rule with God, and was faithful with the Saints:
There was a Remnant of the faithful of Israel, that rather then they would join
in worship with Jeroboam, some of the Levites, and the people, 2 Chronicles,
11.14,16. they left their possessions, and in the desolation of the ten Tribes,
they were preserved; but when they had peace, what the Lord had done, they were
neither moved by his Mercy unto themselves, nor by his Judgments upon their
brethren: But, They provoked the Lord, and they justified their Sister by their
evil doings: Therefore those that were preserved in the former calamity,
there is a Judgment also remains for them; there is a rhyme of trial that yet is
reserved for Jacob: and these were the people amongst whom the Prophet lived;
For he was in the Court of the Prison when Jerusalem was taken: and this is
called Jacobs trouble, Lam. 1.17. The Lord has commanded concerning Jacob,
that the Adversaries shall be round about, etc. therefore by Jacob here, is
meant only Judah, that is, the two Tribes that did not depart from God in the
Revolt and Apostasy of the ten Tribes: and that those of Israel that for
conscience sake, did leave their Habitations, and went and dwelt in Judah and
Jerusalem; yet there is a time of trouble for them also.

2. What Is meant by the time of trouble? It Is in the Original, Hab. 3.16.
tempus augustiae, a time of straits; which is called a day of straits, when
the Lord did come up upon them and invade them with his Troops: for so the Army
of the Babylonians is called: when they should be led into Captivity by the
will and command of others, for their Persons and Estates to be made use of as
a prey, to serve the wills and ends of strangers and servants: For strangers,
Jer. 30.8. Strangers shall no more serve themselves of them: And for servants,
Lam. 5.8. Servants rule over us, and there is none to deliver us out of their
hands. Now when the walls of the City were broken down, the Temple destroyed,
the Worship of God profaned, and all the Ordinances of God trampled under
foot, all Order and Authority deposed, and all things subjected unto the will
and lusts of a conquering Army, now it was a time of straits, great straits in
point of conscience; for they would now be working them about to their way, and
persuading them to worship their Gods, Jer. 10.11. Now to be under the power of
men, and not to be subjected to their lusts, and serve the lusts of men, it is a
great strait; and straits also in respect of the affliction, having their lives
always hanging in doubt; having their bread by weight, and their water by
measure; and in respect of succor, in a great strait also, for there was no
deliverer: Lam. 1.3. All her Persecutors overtook her, between the streights,
that there was no escaping, no way to avoid them; and therefore, 2 Timothy 3.5.
These shall be difficult times, in which men should meet with great and variety
of straits, that they should not know which way to turn themselves, etc.

Thirdly; it is called a great day, magnum pro formidabile, Call. Terribilis aut
mire calamitosa, a magnitudine supplicii, magnus nominatur. Theodor. And we do
read of five Great Days in the Scripture.

First, the day of the Lord, spoken of in Malach. 4.6. I will send you Elijah
the Prophet before the great and terrible day ^f the Lord: that is interpreted,
Luke 1.17. of John Baptist, who was to be the forerunner of Christ's coming: And
this is called a great day, for the great manifestations of God, wherein life
and immortality should be brought to light by the Gospel; the great changes of
Ordinances, and the great destruction of the Enemies, the terrible Judgments
that should then be poured out; for Mal. 4.1. The day comes that shall burn as
an Oven, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble; that is, when the Sun of
Righteousness does arise with healing in his wings, etc. And for the terrible
Judgments that under the Gospel the Lord would pour out upon the world, and
that is meant, Acts 2.28. Joel 2.3. The Sun shall be turned into darkness, the
Moon into blood, before that great day of the Lord come. It Is spoken of the
great Judgments that the Lord Christ would pour out upon the world, and
thereby make way for the receiving the Gospel publicly; for he does shake
Heaven and Earth, and thereby makes way for the coming of the desire of all
Nations; for out of the Throne, when Christ is exalted, comes thunderings, and
lightnings, and voices, Rev. 4.5.

Secondly, there is the great day of Jezreel, Hos. 1. last. That is, when the
Lord shall call home his ancient people; and gather together the outcasts of
Israel: Which shall be a day in which the Lord shall appear in his glory; for
when he does build Zion, he does appear in his glory; a day of the restitution
of all things, a day of enriching of the world, a day when new Jerusalem shall
come down from God out of heaven; and a day in which the kingdoms of the earth
shall be given to the Lord and his Christ; and there shall not be any more any
pricking bryer, or any grieving thorn in all the land: there shall be no more a
Canaanite in the land forever; all persecuting Powers shall be subdued.

Thirdly, there is a great day, when the battle Armageddon shall be fought, Rev.
16.14. When all the Powers of the earth shall rally and gather together their
broken Troops against the Church of God; they shall be the greatest combination
that ever has been, and in which all the opposite Powers shall be utterly and
finally broken; and thereby way shall be made for the vial poured upon the air,
which brings in the binding of Satan, chap. 20. Now this battle, with the issue
of it, we have chap. 19.19,20,21. Now from the great preparations that the
enemies do make, and the great destruction which then they shall be sure to
find, and the great things which shall follow upon this, and that in this day
the Lord will make way for, therefore it is called, the great day of God
Almighty; when the Lord shall fulfill all his promises, and prophecies, and
Christ shall be clothed with a garment dipped in blood, and his name shall be
called the Word of God.

Fourthly, the day of Judgment is a great day also, the Angels are said to be
reserved in chains of darkness unto the Judgment of the great day; for then
shall the son of man sit upon the throne of his glory, and all Nations shall be
gathered together before him; and he shall separate them one from another, as a
Shepherd divides his Sheep from the Goats, etc. and he shall then pass a
final sentence, an eternal judgment upon the eternal estates of men, and set
a gulf between them for ever, which they shall never pass; and when he has so
done, he shall resign, or give up his kingdom unto God the Father, and then all
the present ways of administration shall cease.

Fifthly, when the Lord brings any special judgment or affliction upon his
people, that also is called a great day, Zeph. 1.14. the great day of the Lord
is near, it is a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick
darkness, that Trumpet and Alarm against the fenced Cities, and against the
high Towers; it is a threatening of the same Judgment there which here the
Prophet speaks of, the captivity of Babylon; and its called the great day of
the Lord, and so it is here called also.

Fourthly, it is said that it is such a day that there is none like to it; that
is,

First, it is the greatest evil that ever befell that people, they had been
smitten with Pestilence, with scarcity of bread, cleaness of teeth, invasions
of Enemies, but never any like unto this, and therefore does the Prophet call
it, an only evil, Ezekiel. 7.5,6,7. it is come; and it is not a high sound, the
echo of the mountains, but it shall be so in truth, and in reality, in which
the fury of the Lord shall be poured out upon them; he would give the dearly
beloved of his soul into the hand of his enemies.

Secondly, there is none like it, if we also compare Gods dealing with them, and
with other people: The Lord has not dealt so with any Nation, as he has done
with Jerusalem, and therefore they are afflicted, and in captivity with the
heathen Nations, who are at ease and sit still, Zach. 1.13.14. For judgment
must begin at the House of God; and there is at the last a worse end remaining,
for them that obey not the Gospel, etc.

Secondly, here is a consolation also, Jacob shall have his time of trouble, but
it is yet but a time; the people of God never enter into affliction without a
promise, and therefore they are prisoners of hope, when they are in a pit in
which there is no water, Zach. 9.11,12. There are three great promises that the
Saints have under all their afflictions.

First, they are promised support in the affliction, I will be with you; and,
there is a River, the streams whereof do make glad the City of God; Genesis 15.
there is a light that goes between the pieces, in the middle of the darkness:
the bush in the fire is not burnt: a peculiar providence watches over them, to
keep them from fainting under the affliction.

Secondly, they are promised Sanctification: This is the fruit of the
affliction, to take away their sins: by this shall the iniquity of Jacob be
purged; they shall be made partakers of his holiness; and of his glory; for
these light afflictions that are but for a moment, shall work for us a more
exceeding, and eternal weight of glory.

Thirdly, there is a promise of deliverance out of affliction: Israel shall not
dye in A^gypt, though it be four hundred years before they come forth; though
the Temple be trodden down of the Gentiles, and the woman be in the wilderness
1260. days, yet she shall not always be in a wilderness estate; and though
they be in Babylon, yet the Lord by the blood of the Covenant will send them
forth out of the pit, and he will break the yoke from off the neck of the
anointing, etc. And some think (as Calvin) that to be the meaning of Is. 9.1.
Her dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when he first lightly
afflicted the land of Zabulon, etc. that was, in the inroads formerly made upon
them by Tiglah Pileser, and was that greater then the captivity when the City
should be destroyed, and the Temple burnt with fire, and there was no
comparison in the affliction, but yet the darkness should not be such; and the
reason is this, huic certa permissionem esse additam, cum in prioribus nulla
esset, better be as low as Hell with a promise, then in Paradise without it; the
darkness of the bottomless pit would not be utter darkness, if there were but
the light of a promise, for the soul to look upon, for there is a time of the
pro nise Acts 7.17. when it will truly speak, and not lie.

But what are the grounds why God will not spare his own people?

Hence the grounds are these two.

First, God will not spare his own people; there is a time of Jacoh's trouble,
when even Gods own people shall be reduced to extremity, and there shall come
upon them a time of straits.

Secondly, Jacobs trouble is but for a time; there is a day of deliverance for
them, they shall be saved out of it.

The Doctrine is this.

Doctrine.
There is a time of Jacobs trouble: Gods own dearest: people are many times
brought into a time of straits.

It Is true, that through a man's whole life, Christianus must be crucianus, he
must take up his cross that will follow the Lord: There Is no son that he
receives but he chvstises. Affliction is a Child's portion in the ways of
holiness; their correction is as truly from the hand of their father, as their
provision is. But my purpose at present is to speak of some special times of
Jacobs trouble; a great day, a day of straits: And God does many times bring
his own people unto this: It will appear to be true from all the dealings of
God with the Saints; the children of Israel were in bondage in Egypt long, and
their affliction was great, but there was a time when the bricks were doubled,
and the opposition heightened, so that they were as dead carrion cast out to the
Ravens, Genesis 15. And though Israel were hated of all the Nations, which God
called their evil neighbors, yet there were some special straits that befell
them, as in the days of Asa, 2 Chronicles. 14.9,10. When there came an Army of the
Ethiopians, an host of a thousand thousand men; and in the days of Hezckiah,
when Senacherib besieged Jerusalem, its a day of trouble, of rebuke, and of
blasphemy, Isa. 37.3. But yet there was a time of greater straits, when they
must be carried into captivity, and the glory of the Lord removed from his own
habitation. And the Gospel was no sooner placed in the world, but the great Red
Dragon raised a persecution; the Heathen Emperors, and all the Powers of their
Empire, Rev. 12.1,3. And that Power was no sooner broken, and the Church
obtained of God a Manchild, but immediately there was a flood cast out after
the woman; the Arrian Heresy, and they persecuted the Church more then the
Pagans had done before; and then the Earth helped the Woman, etc. Then does
Antichrist arise, and the people of God do prophecy in sackcloth and ashes:
Witnesses they are, and two Witnesses, for their paucity, and for their
sufficiency^ and yet there is a time of greater straights that remains for
them; there is the time of their fulfilling, and of their killing: so that God
does reserve a time of straits for his own people; there is a time of Jacobs
trouble, etc.

First, because the Lord will give unto them some eminent experiences of his
providence, under which they walk; it is true that he is the Savior of all men,
but especially of them that believe; and upon all the glory there is a covering
at all times, Isa. 4.5. but the greater the straits are, the more eminent shall
the protection be; if Daniel be in the Lions den, and the three children in the
fiery furnace: the wonder had not been so great, if the bnsh had not been in
the fire, but to see it in the fire, and yet not to consume, that was the
greatest sight that ever Moses saw before. When the Earth is removed, and the
Mountains cast into the midst of the sea, then there is need of a Song upon
Alamoth, pro occultis, for Gods hidden ones, Psalm. 46.1. If the Saints are in
the pit in which there is nowater, now turn to your strong holds ye prisoners
of hope, satis praesidii in uno Deo.

Secondly, Satan being the God of this world, he does always rule the present
world, which God has redeemed the Saints from, Gal. 1.4. And the children of
disobedience walk in the course of the present world: The world is cast into
variety of shapes, but into what form soever the present evil world is cast
into, Satan is the god of the world, and he does apply himself to rule the
world under all the forms into which the Lord does cast it. And therefore Hier
om says well, Erras, mi frater, erras, si putas unquam Christum persecutione
non pati, etc. If the world be Pagan, Satan rules in the great Red Dragon, and
so brings the Saints into their time of straits. If the face of the world
change, and it turn Christian, then Satan rules also in that, and casts out a
flood after the woman. If that Flood be dried up, then Antichrist does arise,
and he rules in him as a false Prophet; and afterward, 2 Timothy 3.1,2. If a form
of godliness be brought in, under that he will rule, and men be lovers of their
own selves, proud, boasters, treacherous, high minded, and despisers of those
that are good; and therefore there must needs be straits in all estates that
shall await the Saints of God.

Thirdly, the more spiritual light grows, the greater are the straits that the
people of God are brought into.

First, because the more are their consciences seared, 1 Timothy 4.2. It is not a
cold Iron that will sear the Conscience, but when there is evident, clear
convincing light, and men be told of it, and yet will go against it, their
Consciences are seared by it, and in Judgment they are given over unto a
reprobate mind.

Secondly, the more they are exasperated against the Truths of God, because
they do come nearer unto the sin against the Holy Ghost, which is the Devils
sin; and it does consist in malice upon a high and a raised light. No men were
so cruel as the Pharisees, that did sin against the Holy Ghost; and therefore
if prophesying in sackcloth and ashes would satisfy the lusts of men in times
past, now killing is not sufficient, but their dead bodies shall not be buried,
to express their former malice and rage against them; and therefore in the
latter times, the straits of the people of God must needs be greater then ever
they have been in times past.

Fourthly, God will by this make way for an utter ruin of the Churches Enemies;
the greater straits they do bring the Saints into, the nearer is their
destruction, and the sooner will God arise. I have seen the affliction of my
people that are in Egypt, and I have heard their cry: For the Churches Enemies
must perish by the Churches hand, and therefore they are said to be, a cup of
trembling, and a burthe some stone: The Church brought that mighty people into
a condition fit to be consumed: Jerusalem was to them a cup of trembling; now
they think to drink it off, and it proves their poison; and when they have
brought them to extremity, that they thought all had been sure, then they
themselves perish: It Is by the Churches straits that the Enemies are ruin^d:
When the ploughers plowd upon their backs, and made long their furrows, then
will the Lord cut the cords of the wicked, Psalm. 129.3.

The Use is for Consolation to all the people of God; and this I will reduce
unto three Questions.

First, with what mind God does bring his people into straits? What the
thoughts of God are toward them when he does it? And here we shall see that
God thinks thoughts of peace to them all the while, and not of evil, Jer. 29.11.

Secondly, in what measure will the Lord do it?

Thirdly, unto what end?

For the first: With what mind does the Lord bring his people into straits?
What are the thoughts of God toward them when he does it?

First, he does it from a principle of Love, and their Afflictions are grounded
on the Second Covenant, as their Mercies are; other men's afflictions are from
the First Covenant, as a fruit of the Curse, Mich. 7.9. the Church says there,
I will bear the indignation of the Lord, etc. Why is God in indignation with
his own people? indeed he is angry with the wicked every day. There is a double
anger of God, simplex and redundans in personam; he is angry at his peoples
sins, but yet he loves their persons; and he afflicts them from a principle of
faithfulness. Psalm. 119.75. For he has covenanted to keep them from the evil
of the world; he is to preserve them unto his heavenly Kingdom; and he does, as
I may say, sometimetimes preserve them in Salt, and sometimes in Sugar, as we
use to do with some things that we would preserve.

Secondly, God looks upon your suffering as the suffering of Christ; the Saints
being one with him, their services are Christ's, and their sufferings are
Christ's, they bear fruit in him, they live in him, Col. 1.24. So they fill up
what is behind of the sufferings of Christ.

Thirdly, whilst he does smite them he is afflicted with them; in all their
afflictions he is afflicted; though Christ be in heaven, yet he has the same
nature there that he had here; and he stands in the same relation to us now he
is in glory, that he did here, he is not ashamed to call us brethren; and
therefore his compassion still remains: Jer. 31.22 Since I spoke against him, I
remembered him still: my bowels are troubled for him. The heart of God goes out
unto all the Saints in their afflictions.

Fourthly, whilst he does afflict them, he does wait to be gracious, Isa.
30.18. He does not defer deliverance because he is not willing to bestow it,
but because his people are not prepared for it, that is the reason they are so
long out of glory, Col. 1.12. because they are not yet meet to be partakers of
the Inheritance with the Saints in life; and to make them so, he does sit by,
as a Refiner, and he will only purge away their dross by their afflictions.

Fifthly, all the while they are in straits, he does take special notice of
their sufferings, and he is deeply displeased with the Instruments that afflict
his people, and he is preparing for their ruin all the while; for he takes
special notice of their wrong, Rev. 2.2. I know thy work, and thy labor, and
thy patience, etc. Exo. 3.7. I know their sorrows: He has a bottle for their
tears.

Secondly, he is deeply displeased with the Instruments: Zach. 1.15. He sent
his people into Babylon, but yet, I am sore displeased with the heathen; I was
but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction. So that whilst
God does use them as the rod of his anger, he is angry with them.

Thirdly, he is all the while the Enemies are afflicting of his people,
preparing for their overthrow, Zac. 1.21,23. When he does raise up horns, he
does provide Carpenters also. And Jesus Christ all the while is preparing for
to be his peoples rescue, though they see him not, yet he is behind the
Mirtle-trees at the bottom, Zach. 1.8.

Sixthly, he will make their affliction to be the great means of their
exaltation; Jacob shall arise when he is small: The killing of the Witnesses
made way for their Resurrection, the more glorious. These are the thoughts and
the mind of God toward Jacob in the day of his trouble.

Secondly, in what measure will he do this? Jer. 30.11. I will correct thee in
measure, but not leave thee altogether unpunished: And here consider these five
particulars.

First, it shall not be according to the desert of your sins, Ezra 9.13. I have
punished you less then your iniquities deserve: He will not stir up all his
wrath, Psalm 28.38. It Is the Lords mercy we are not consumed. We might have
been in Hell as well as in Babylon.

Secondly, it shall be but according to the measure of your necessities: He
does afflict but when need is, 1 Pet. 1.6. And it shall be no farther than need
is, Isa. 28.24. He will not always be ploughing; there is a sowing time, so
much breaking of the ground as will prepare it for the seed, and no more.

Thirdly, it shall be proportionable to a man's place in the mystical body of
Christ: There are some vessels of Gold, and some of Silver, 2 Timothy 2.20,21.
Christ the head was the first born amongst many brethren, Romans 8.29. And as all
the brethren are not called forth to the like eminent services, so all are not
called to the like eminent sufferings.

Fourthly, it shall be proportionable to their strength, 1 Cor. 10.13. He will
not suffer us to be tempted above what we are able: and he will give in
supplies of graces suitable unto the suffering, 2 Cor. 12.9. My grace is
sufficient, etc. Isa. 28.27. He does not turn the cart wheel on all the Corn,
but he has a staff for the fitches, and a rod for the cummin, etc. He takes
measure of your graces, of your spirits, and of your strength, and he does give
it unto you proportionable to your need.

Fifthly, there are always some mitigating circumstances, that do abate and
sweeten the affliction; non dantur purae tenebrae, there is a light between the
pieces, Genesis 15.17.

First, God does sometimes give them favor in the eyes of their enemies, Psalm.
10.6.96. he made them to pity them that carried them captive. Joseph shall
find favor with the Keeper of the prison, and Daniel with the chiefest of the
Eunuchs.

Secondly, what is wanting in outward blessings, he will make up to them
inspiritual ordinances; Isa. 20.20. Though he does feed them with the bread of
affliction, and the water of trouble, yet their eyes shall see their Teachers.

Thirdly, if they have none of these yet they shall have his gracious presence
with them enlarging of their hearts; that with Paul and Silas they shall sing
in a prison, and be able to say, it was good for me that I was afflicted: As
one of the Martyrs said, I was in prison till I came into prison; nil crus
sentit in nervo, dum animus est in coelo.

Thirdly, unto what end does the Lord do this? Every wise Agent works for an
end, and the more wisdom he has, the higher ends he aims at in every action,
and the more ends he does make to meet in every thing that he does, Isa. 30.18.
The Lord is a God of Judgment: It Is there put for Wisdom: He orders and
moderates all things, in reference unto the end that he does aim at; and as the
Lord in all his ways is wonderful in wisdom and counsel; so he is in all the
afflictions of the Saints; there is much wisdom seen in his high ends, that he
has in afflicting his people, and in making many ends to meet. I Will name four
great ends.

First, the Lord does bring his people to straits, to prevent sin.

1. In the rising of lust, 2 Cor. 12.9. that I might not be exalted, etc.

2. The acting of lust if it does arise, Job 33.17. He does chastise a man with
strong pain, it is to keep man from his purpose, and to hide pride from his
eyes: When he has taken up an evil purpose, there is a cross interposeth,
interactum primum and secundum.

3. For the finishing of sin, Hos. 2.6,7. He hedged up their way; they were
going on in it, but God does put a stop in their way, as men do to beasts,
their way is hedged up.

Secondly, the Lord does bring his people to straits for their Instruction,
Mich. 6.9. There Is not a rod but it has a voice. Beasts feel the rod, but the
Saints they hear it.

1. God does it, to let them see the evil of sin; for a man is held with the
cords of his own sin, Prove. 5.22. Ezekiel. 7.10. As pride does bud, so does the
rod blossom.

2. God does it to let them see the emptiness of the creature, Gal. 6.14. I
rejoice in the cross of Christ, for by it the world is crucified unto me, and I
unto the world: He was thereby enabled to look upon the world as a crucified
thing, that they may see they are but strangers and pilgrims, and therefore
should seek a country, and hasten home.

3. To let them know what it is to have fellowship with the suffering of
Christ, Phil. 3.10. There Is a fellowship of the sufferings of Christ, that the
Saints desire to know experimentally in themselves; that as Christ was
supported under suffering, so may they; and as he was perfected by suffering,
so may they also be; for he did in suffering leave himself an example, 1 Pet.
2.21. as well as in dying.

Thirdly, for their sanctification.

1. To purge their corruption; the bundle of folly the rod of correction must
drive out, Zach. 13,8,9. Two parts shall be cut off and dye, and the third part
shall pass through the fire, to refine them as silver, and they shall call
upon my name, and I will hear them.

2. To improve their Graces; for he does it to make them partakers of his
holiness, Heb. 12.10. And he will do it in a higher way, by a cross sometimes,
then by an ordinance he will make the way foul, and the soul fruitful, Jam.
1.3.4. Tribulation works patience, and patience experience, and experience
hope, etc. There Is a sweet influence in these showers of affliction that ripen
the graces of the Saints.

Thirdly, it is to prepare them for services, 1 Cor. 1.5,6. He comforted us in
all our tribulation, that we might be able to comfort others with the same
consolation. 1 King. 4.31. Heman is counted one of the wisest men of the world,
and in Psalm 88. we see how he attained it, by being trained up in the school
of affliction; and God does cast some men into great afflictions, that thereby
he may fit them for high and eminent services afterward: Joseph had never been
so fit to have been a Governor in Egypt, if his foot had not been hurt in the
stocks; nor Moses to have been a leader of the people of Israel, if he had not
been banshed forty years in the Wilderness; and David his Crown had never sat
so well, if he had not been hunted as a Partridge upon the mountains.

Fourthly, that the Lord may have some to give their testimonies unto his
truth; that it may appear, that there are some that do stand for God, and dare
appear for him; when the world wondered after the Beast, there are some that
stand with the Lamb upon mount Zion, Rev. 14.2. There are two Witnesses. The
Witnesses of God are but a few, yet some there are that God will raise up in
all Ages, so that corruption in Doctrine and Worship shall not go untestified
against; for the Lord will not leave the world without witness; and hereby the
Lord will endear his Witnesses, and raise them up in the hearts of the Saints,
it will make them dear, and their names precious in the Churches, for none have
been so precious in their names as they that did not count their blood
precious, they thought not their lives dear to them, they loved not their lives
to the death: How precious was Peter in his suffering? When all the Church
engaged their interest unto God for him, Acts 12. As Roses are sweeter in the
Still then upon the stalk, so it is with the Saints in all their sufferings in
the apprehension of the Churches.

Use 2.
Is it so, that there is a day of trouble to Jacob? Then do you look for a day
of trouble also, and to that end it is your wisdom to discern the signs of the
times, Mat. 16.3. God has stretched the expansum of his Word over the rational
world, and as by the heavens a man may discern in the natural world, so by the
Word, if a man be skilful in it, a man may discern the signs of the times in
the rational world also. In the Word there are two sorts of rules.

First, ancient Predictions.

Secondly, present Dispensations.

1. Ancient Predictions, Rev. 10.7. cum finituis sint, when they were about to
finish: The 1260 days are not years fulfilled; therefore the killing time is
to come; for the Beast receives his Kingdom with the seven Kings since the
(...) was removed.

2. There was never yet that perfect Victory, that they did say, they are dead;
there were none that did visibly appear to bear witness against them, therefore
it is yet to come.

Secondly, present dispensations compared with the rules of the Word.

First when there is a general decay of Wisdom in Rulers, and children and babes
rule over a people, Isa. 27.14. I will do a mavelous work, the wisdom of the
wise men shall perish, and now I will distress Ariel.

Secondly, when there is poured out upon a people the spirit of a deep sleep,
as Isa. 29.10. that nothing could awaken them, but as men sleeping upon the top
of a Mast, though the Sea roar, and the Wind make a noise, yet they sleep still;
when men are secure, then the distress of Ariel is near; I will search
Jerusalem with candles, and the men that are settled upon their Lees, etc.

Thirdly, when there is a general oppression and mercilesness in the Rulers,
Zac. 11.5. When a people become the flock of the slaughter, Mic. 7.3,4. the
Judge asks for a reward: now shall be their perplexity.

Fourthly, when there are general neglects of Government and order amongst a
people, every one does what is right in his own eyes, when the base does presume
against the honorable, and the children against the ancient, Isa. 3.5. then
presently there is a ruin coming, ver. 8. Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is
fallen: Judge. 18.7. When there was no master of restraint in Laish, their ruin
was near.

Fifthly, when there are bitter envyings and parties, the people shall be as
fuel for the fire, Isa. 9.19,20. No man spares his brother, but every man eats
the flesh of his own arm, etc. Jer. 8.7. My people know not the judgment of
the Lord.

Doctrine 2
Yet Jacobs trouble is but for a time, then shall deliverance be, Mich. 7.9.
Though I fall, I shall arise, and the Lord will be light about me; the rod of
the wicked shall not always lie upon the lot of the righteous. The Witnesses
though they be killed, yet they shall not always lie dead, but they shall rise
again, etc. I cannot now stand to prove this Doctrine, but spend the remainder
of the time I have to speak in a short use to all the people of God.

Use.
First, live by faith in this time of trial; the Lord does but wait to be
gracious, and he says, blessed be those that wait for him, Hab. 2.4. The just
shall live by his Faith. The meaning is, he shall live comfortably under the
cross; for it is an expression like that of the Apostle, Now we live if ye
stand fast. And the acts of Faith that we should now exercise should be these:
I Will name two or three.

First, commit your selves to him quietly; leave your selves with him, Psalm.
114.14. As you have committed your souls to him, so to him also commit your
way, Dan. 3.17. Be not careful in this matter, he that has cast me into the
fire, will assuredly watch over me in it, because he has promised to bring me
out of it.

Secondly, wait for him till he be gracious, and do not make have; he that
believes does not make have. Do not use unlawful means out of pride of
passion, because you will not wait Gods leisure, nor do not use compliance with
carnal men to deliver thee, for that is not the way of faith.

Thirdly, look toward God in thy prayers, under this consideration; that he
has undertaken deliverance, 2 Chronicles 22.12. We have no might, neither know we
what to do, but our eyes are toward thee; for it is the exercise of Faith that
does procure deliverance, Genesis 49 21. His bow abode i^ ^re g^; that is invictum
robur; it is by this that the (...) of God prove victorious in their sufferings.

But how may a man know when deliverance is near? Are there not rules for that
as well as the other. I will only name there three rules.

First, when the people of God look toward him and return; if not, Lev.
26.24,25. ^e will punish them seven times more, till he has destrey'd them;
for there is a pedigree of judgment, Hos 1. Jeel 2.14. Rent your hearts, and
no your garments, etc. Prepare to m^et thy God, O Israel. There is no going to
God in the way of his judgment, but by meeting of him, and that is not in a
way of opposition, but in a way of submission.

Secondly, when the hearts of the enemies and their sins are grown unto a
height, Rev. 14.18. when the grapes are fully ripe, when men do add unto al
their sins contempt of God, and say, Who is the Lord? it is an argument they
are not like to stand long, that do stretch their mouths out against heaven,
and their tongues run through the earth: When Instruments do rise against
their maker, and the axe is against him that hews with it, then I will send
amongst the fat ones says the Lord, and kindle a burning under their glory.

Thirdly, when the hearts of the people of God are low, and their spirits do
fail, and they say our bones are dry, our hope is past, and we are cut off,
Ezekiel. 37.12. When the Son of man comes shall he find faith upon earth? Men will
not believe it, Luke 18 8. And though ye see no ways or means of deliverance,
yet remember, It is not by power, nor by might, but by my spirit, Zach. 4.7.
And the earth did help the woman. The Lord can make use of any Instruments for
the Redemption of his servants: The barborous Nations came in for their
succor, which I fear will be the Judgment upon this Nation.

GRACE ABUSED.
At a Fast for abused Liberty, Febr. 28th.
JUDE 4. Turning the Grace of God into wantonness, etc.


THE word propounded for this days humiliation is, that we may take shame to
our selves before God, for that horrible abuse of that Gospel liberty which God
has given us, which is the fruit of the Prayers, the Tears, and the Blood of
the ancient Saints of God amongst us: Rara quisquam circa bona sua satis
cautus; it is a very rare thing for men to walk worthily under Mercies that they
have earnestly desired, when they are enjoyed.

There are two things that most men desire, and they are, Power and Liberty;
and when they have attained them, I may say they are unto men, as they describe
waters, suis terminis difficile continentur. They are easily apt to run over in
what vessels soever you put them in. I can my self remember, when Arminianism
did first invade this Nation, how much the old Puritans (for that was then the
term of reproach) were affected with it; how the Ministers preached against it,
and writ against it, and the Saints fasted, and prayed against it, as that
which they looked upon as the inlet of Popery; for if you will receive it first
in its doctrine, the same persons will quickly begin to set it up in its
worship also: And it was so much laid to heart by the godly Patriots of the
Nation, that I have been assured from good hands, that they drew up an Act of
Parliament to be past against it in the Parliament at Oxford, which they did
intend to have stood upon, and by an Act of the Civil Authority to have
suppressed it, had not the Parliament been in a sudden, and in an untimely manner
broken up; and yet now we can cry out against Popery, and yet maintain with
open face the Doctrines of Popery, and that under the notion or name of the
greatest liberty that can be, and I can remember also that in the Bishops time,
when the people of God could not have liberty to meet without danger, or the
name of a Conventicle, though it cross Tertullians notion; for he says, cum
boni coeunt, non est factio dicenda sed curia, etc. and in danger of a High
Commission: How would the people of God have rejoiced at the Liberty that now
they may enjoy? and how sad it is to see how they are neglected by some, and
strangely profaned by others they cannot be liberi unless they be Sacrile^i,
as Augustine against the Pelagians, etc. And this being the work of the day, to
humble our souls for the^e corrupt opinions, and abominable practices, that
under the notion and conceit of abused Liberty, are broken forth amongst us;
that which the Lord requires of us, is this, That we should not only cry out
against it as many of us do, but have our hearts seriously affected with it,
and desire the same for our Governors also, that do enjoin this Fast, that
they may be humbled for that, for which they do enjoin upon us a day of
Humiliation; for every new Fast is a new obligation both to them, and to us;
against this evil; not only to speak against it, and pray against it, but also
to endeavor to reform it in our places, to the utmost of our power; for there
is not any thing that is a greater provocation unto God, then a cloak of
Religious duties drawn over any corrupt intention: Of a Jezebels Fast, and a
Pharisees long Prayers; the one to shed innocent blood, and the other to
devour the estate of an innocent person; and both are an abomination to the
Lord. And this being that which is appointed for the humiliation of this day to
help you therein, and to administer something unto your thoughts, I have made
choice of this Scripture now read unto you.

The grand exhortation in this Epistle, is set down ver. 3. Contend earnestly
for the faith once given unto the Saints. The thing that you must strive for,
is the Faith, the Doctrine of Faith, the Doctrine of the Gospel, which ye cannot
keep without contention; (...), the word signifies, pro viribus, it is to
strive with all their might; or (as some render the word) it is to strive one
after another, in your places, and successive Generations; in super certare; or
certamen repet^re: It Is not enough to strive once, and to assert the Truths,
but ye must do it again, and again, after one another, as often as the Truth of
God is opposed

And he gives the reason of this exhortation.

First, because it is a depositum, that the Lord has in mercy delivered unto
the Saints, Romans 3.2.
which the Lord requires them to keep: You are but Stewards of it, it is
committed unto you, that you should transmit it unto posterity.

Secondly, it was but once given, and therefore you cannot expect, that if you
part with it, the Lord will again bestow it unto you: It Is like the fire upon
the Altar, that was at first kindled from heaven, and was there by the industry
of the Priests to be kept alive, and was never to go out; it was but once
given, it was Gods free Grace to bestow it, and he does expect that it should
be our care and work to preserve it.

Thirdly, he does press this from the danger of it, in regard that the enemies
lie in wait, there are certain men crept in unawares, etc.

First false Teachers; they do not rush in, for then they would be observed,
but they creep in secretly, and in an unobserved manner, Rev. 13. A beast
rising out of the earth: There Is a temporal power of the Pope; for he is
represented under a double vision, of two Beasts.

First, a Beast with seven heads, and ten horns, that is, he did claim a power
over the ten Kings to depose them, and release their subjects from obedience
unto them; and this was a power that the ten Kings did give unto him, and this
did arise out of the Sea, from the wars, and trouble, and commotions that were
in the world: But there is another description of the Pope, as he is the false
Prophet, which relates unto the Ecclesiastical power, that he takes to himself;
and so he has two horns, one as a Lamb, an emblem of Meekness and Innocence,
and he arises out of the earth, that is, stirpium more, as things do grow out
of the earth in a secret and unobserved way.

Secondly, the thing that they trade in, is the Truths of God, and the souls of
men; therefore contend earnestly for the Faith; for when false Teachers come,
it is the Faith that they do mainly aim at, and Satan is the grand deceiver in
them.

And the Apostle comes also to a description of the persons with whom your
contention was to be.

First, they are described by the act of God upon them, what they are in Gods
Predetermination.

Secondly, by the act of sin within them, and what they are by their own
corruptions.

First, by the act of God upon them; they were of old ordained to destruction.
The Greek word is, (...), praescripti, they are prescribed, fore-written,
because there is an act of God in revealing of them, that is passed upon them
from all eternity. It is unto this damnation that they are appointed: And some
read the words, (...), ad hoc judicium; for to be given over into such a way of
sinning, it is the greatest spiritual judgment that can befall a man in this
life, and does flow from a sentence and a decree passed upon him by God; for he
that has ordained men unto damnation, has by a permissive (though not an
effective will) appointed also the means by which he shall come unto that end,
that so he is ordained to be damned.

Secondly, by the power of sin within them: All ungodly men, pretend what they
will, they have no fear of God in them, nor any respect unto God, they are men
that are strangers unto God, and live without him in the world, that is their
general description; they are ungodly men that have no fear of God in their
hearts, and that do whatsoever they do, without any respect unto God, though
they are many times great pretenders, yet of them all it is said, that their God
is their beily, and all that they do is for some low end; it is with no respect
unto God.

Secondly, they are more particularly described.

First, by their desperate opinions; they turn the grace of God into wantonness.

Secondly, by their devilish conversations; They deny the Lord God, and the
Lord Jesus Christ: it is spoken in respect of their lives and ways: 2 Tit.
1.16. They profess they know God, but in works they deny him, etc. And we shall
ever find, that monstrous opinions are ever accompanied with monstrous
corruptions.

It Is the description of these men according unto their wicked opinions that I
am to speak of at present, and there are in the words three things to be
explained.

First, what is meant by the Grace of God?

Secondly, what is meant by Wantonness?

Thirdly, what it is to turn this Grace into Wantonness? etc.

First, what is meant by the Grace of God? As given unto us, Grace is taken two
ways in Scripture, either for the Gospel, the Word of his Grace, as it is
called Acts 20.32. and so it is taken 2 Cor. 6.1. We as workers together with
him, do beseech you not to receive the grace of God in vain. It Is spoken of
the Doctrine of the Gospel, which the Lord had sent amongst them; and Tit.
2.11. The Grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, etc.
It Is spoken of the Doctrine of the Gospel, the Word of his grace.

Secondly, it is put for the impress of this Word upon the heart; for it is the
word writ in the heart; they are the habits of Grace in us, it is into this
mould we are cast, Rom 6.17. and it is by looking into this Glass that we are
transformed, etc. 2 Cor. 3. last v. It Is the Word ingrafted that does change
the man: Jam. 1.21.
And so we are said to receive from Christ Grace for Grace, Joh. 1.16. The
unction in us being answerable to that of those that are in Christ; and that
gratia habitualis in us, answering that which was in Christ's humane nature; for
he had the same spirit^ dwelling in him, and working habits in his humane
nature, that we also have; but it is not this latter that is meant here; for the
Devil himself cannot turn Grace into Wantonness though corruption will
endeavor to m^ke advantage of Grace, but Faith it self is the new creature,
the devine nature, it is that which is born of God which cannot sin, Joh. 1^ And
therefore it must here be meant of the Word of his Grace, the Doctrine of the
Gospel.

Secondly, what is m^ant by Wantonness? the word (...), signifies a wanton,
vam, licentious, and unruly disposi^ion of heart: It is by Zanch. described to
be effraenis quae^am peccandi libido: ^eing past feeling they gave themselves
over unto lasciviousn^ss 1 Pet. 4.3. it is said, Whilst they were Gentiles they
did walk in lasciviousness, excess of wine, etc. It notes all manner of lust
and filthiness, etc. Ephesians. 4.19.
For all men do not sin with the same lewdness, nor with the same resolution
of spirit, that other men do, Ezekiel. 29.13. (...) cogita^o, consilium,
machinatio, etc. The more thought rulness that there is in sinning, and upon
the greater grounds men's lusts are bottomed, with the more confidence, and
fearlesness, and resolution of spirit they do commit them; and this looseness of
spirit and resolution in any way of sinning, without any check, or reluctance
of spirit, this is called Wantonness.

Thirdly, what is it to turn the Grace of God into Wantonness? The word is
(...), it signifies to transpose a thing, and put it out of its place; to turn
away a thing or a person, and puts it out of its forformer condition, as Heb.
11.5. it is said of Enoch, that the Lord tran slated him; put him out of his
present earthly condition in which he was, and removed him out of his place to
heaven, Gal. 1.6. Why are you so s^on carried away by another Gospel? The false
Teachers had translated them, and put them from their station, in which belief
they stood before they removed them from it; and so when the doctrine of the
Grace of God, that did teach men to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and was
given to make the man of perfect unto every good work, when this grace is by
the lusts of men perverted to a quite contrary end, this is to translate the
grace of God to another end, then that for which the Lord appointed it, when
men do father their lusts upon the Word of God, and bear them up by it; and
this has always been the custom of a I fal^e Teachers; 2 Pet. 3.16. the word
is, (...), they do put the Scripture upon the Rack, and bending them unto
their own bow, they shall serve their turn which way soever their lusts work;
there shall be found something in Scripture that they can lay hold of for it:
And when men do make use of the Doctrines of the Gospel to serve their own
lust, and do grow more loose and licentious under them, this is to pervert the
Gospel of Grace unto an end for which it was never appointed; (...). Justin M.

Hence there are two things to be observed.

First, that there is a Wantonness that goes with corrupt Teachers; wheresoever
they are, corrupt doctrines and wicked practices go together. There are no men
that sin with so much wantonness, that is, with so much licentiousness, liberty
and impudency, as corrupt Teachers do.

Secondly, they will wrest the Word of God, and of his grace unto this end, they
will strengthen their lusts by the word, and so pervert it to an end unto which
it was never appointed.

Doct.
There is a wantonness in corrupt Teachers; there is both wicked doctrines and
wicked practices, for they both go together in the same men.

First, this will appear by the descriptions every where given of them in the
Scripture, they are described and placed in the highest rank of wicked men,
Phil. 3.2.19. Degs they are; that is unclean creatures that return unto their
vomit; and they are joined with evil workers, their God is their belly, they
merely serve their own lusts in all that they do; and they do it with a great
deal of impudency, which is the highest pitch of sinning, they glory in that
which should be looked upon as their shame: The Apostle had said, 2 Peter
2.14.18,19. That there should be false Teachers amongst them, that should
privily bring in damnable, (or destructive) Heresies; and he describes the
men, having eyes full of Adultery, and cannot cease to sin, having their hearts
exercised with covetous practices, cursed children; and they allure through the
lusts of the flesh, and much wantonness: It is this that is the bait, for it is
(...): They do allure as with a bait, 2 Timothy 3.13. Evil men and deceivers grow
worse and worse: There is no stay, when men once are deceived themselves, and
do become deceivers and seducers of others, the Lord does commonly give them up
in judgment unto all excess of Riot, and they sall to all manner of
lasciviousness, etc.

Secondly, it must needs be so, if we consider from whence does Heresy come.
We have the rise of it, Revel. 9.1,2. And I saw a Star fall from Heaven unto
the Earth, and to him was given the Key of the bottomless pit, and he op^ed
the bottomless pit, and there arose a smoke out of the pit, etc. It Is spoken of
the Judgment of GOD poured out upon R^me, Antichristian in the Eastern part
of the Empire. And the bottomless pit is opened, and that by a Star that.
fell from Heaven: For Mahomet was at first a Christian, and did prosesse the
Christian Religion, till at last meeting with Sergius, a wicked and corrupt
Monk, they made up between them this fardle of Heresies and Follies, by which
they have deceived the world: Now this Star falling, opened the bottomless
pit: That is, it was the Instrument to let out the smoke thereof. And so the
Armies of Mahomet are called, Re^el. 12.15. The Serpent cast out of his mouth a
flood after the woman; that is meant of the Arrian Heresy. Now consider what
can come out of Hell: And what can come out as smoke out of the bottomless
pit, but it must needs be full of filthiness and uncleanness; but hence it is
that all false Doctrines come out of the mouth of the old Serpent, who is
uncleanness it self.

Thirdly, they are in Scripture re^embled unto the wickedest men that ever
were, 2 Pet. 2.15. as Balaam, it is said they followed the way of Balaam, who
was himself a Witch, and one that would be easily hired to curse the people of
God for a reward, and they are Jannes and Jambres, 2 Timothy 3.8. who were two
famous Egyptians of Egypt. There are not a more wicked generation of men in
the world, nor men given up to wantonness and looseness more then they.

Fourthly, no men are so industriously wicked as they are, and they will
compass Sea and Land to make a proselite, and make him tenfold the child of
hell when they have done, more then he was before: Revel. 9.10,18,19. They had
tails like to Scorpions; of these were the third part of men killed; that is,
of the fire, and smoke, and brimstone that came out of their mouths: For their
power is in their mouths, and in their tayls: It Is spoken of the Mahumetans,
who as they did conquer, used their utmost power to promote their Religion, and
the corrupt principles thereof by which they have wholly defiled even all the
Eastern Chuches, they had the Heads of Lions, but they had a st^ng in their
tail, wheresoever they came, they left a sting behind them, and they did kill
not only by their hands, but by the smoke that came out of their mouths:
Their power was not only in their mouths, but in their tails also; they did
a greater mischief by their corrupt Doctrines then they did by all their power
and force of arms, and the men were in better condition that were killed by
their hands, then they that surviving were destroyed hy their tails.

Fifthly, the people of God have abhorred them as the wickedest men that ever
were in the world, and therefore there is no sort of sinners that the Spirit of
God has so set himself, and the Spirit of his Saints so much against, as
these; Tit. 3.10. A heretic reject, etc. And we are exhorted, to beware of
false Teachers; for they come in Sheeps clothing, but they were ravening
Wolves: By their fruits ye shall know them: They be thistles, and ye shall never
gather grapes off them they are thorns, and therefore you shall never gather figs
off them, 3 John 10. We are charged not to receive them into our houses, not
communicate a word with them, not to bid them, God speed: It was the title that
John gave to Cerinthus, I know thee to be primogenitus Satanae, the first born
of the devil: Heretics are they that have received a double portion of this
spirit.

Sixthly, they are such sort of sinners as most immediately acted by the Devil,
of any men in the world; they have the most immediate influences from Hell; and
therefore Revel. 16.13,14. The unclean spirit came out of the mouth of the
D^agon. They are sent forth by his command, and they do receive a commission
from him in another manner than any other sinners do, being as Officers
employed under him: As it is in persecution, it is the Devil that does act
persecutors immediately, Revel. 2.10. The devil shall cast some of you into
prison. So also it is in Heresy, for it is a flood out of the mouth of the
Serpent, Rev. 12.15. And it appears to be a highway of wickedness, and that
which brings all others with it, because Satan did put more confidence in it,
then by any other way to carry on his design; and when he was not able to
uphold his power any longer in a way of persecution, as he did in the first
three hundred years, now he thinks to repair all by a way of Heresy; for
let Christ cast the world into what shape he will, Satan applies himself unto
that shape, that so he may be the ruler of the darkness of it, etc. Now there
being a great influence from Hell upon this; and Satan putting a greater
confidence in it, it does plainly show, that there are more depths of
wickedness in this than in any other way of sinning whatsoever, and it must
needs be, if we consider with our selves these three things.

First, the Understanding is the leading faculty, and therein are laid down the
rules for the whole life. In the practical understanding that is the common
treasury of all the rules of practice, and according unto these a man's whole
life is formed; corrupt but the principals of a man, and his whole life will
quickly be corrupt; for no man is better than his principles, neither can he
be: There Is many a man would be better if he had higher principles; and
therefore the Lord when he shows mercy to a man, and does increase his Grace,
he does usually raise his principles, and then as a man's light does rise, his
Graces will increase; for it is claritas in intellectu parit, and every man
will strive to live up to his principles; a godly man does, and he blaming
himself that he does fall short; and a wicked man shall daily be put upon it,
and therefore many of them, they cannot be so wicked as their principles would
lead them to; they see there is so much flesh in them, that they cannot yet
bring themselves to be persuaded, that there is no Resurrection of the dead,
nor no life after this life, no punishments nor rewards; but if the eye be
darkness, how great is that darkness? By the Eye is meant the Understanding,
or the practical Judgment, which is the guide of a man's way, as the Eye in the
body is, and if that be darkened in the principles of it, the whole body, the
whole life must needs be full of darkness; the blindness in the Eye causes a
darkness all the body over.

Secondly, it must needs be so, because this takes away whatever should
restrain the lusts of men; for there is a sea of corruption in the heart, Isa.
57.20. As the raging Sea, only there are bounds set to it, and what is that
but the light that God does put into their consciences; and men are overawed by
it, they cannot be so wicked as they would; now if lust can once by a corrupt
Doctrine cast off this bridle, what kind of evil can they be withheld from?
What is it they dare not do? Rev. 92. The Su^ne and he air were darkened by
the smoke, luce vintatis prersus extinera. Neither in the Sun, nor in the
Air is there any light, now all light being taken away that should discover
the way of death to a man, and there is an impulse of lust within, that puts
the man upon acting: And whither will not that man run, that has no principle
within to restrain him? He will commit all iniquity with greediness.

Thirdly, There is a just judgment of God upon them in it, that they do
dishonor God in his Truths, God should give them up, (...), Romans 1.26. to that
lust which should bring that dishonor upon them that should make them vile and
abominable, and hateful before men; Satan comes with the deceivableness of
Unrighteousness, because they had pleasure in Unrighteousness: 2 Thessalonians. 2.10.
they were such Doctrines as did in judgment draw out their lusts; for God
does many times in judgment send men Teachers according to their lusts: Micha.
If any man will prophecy of Wine, and strong Drink, he shall be a Prophet to
this people: So the Lord does fit them with Doctrines according to their lusts,
that shall be a means to draw them forth, Ezekiel. 20. I gave them Statutes that
were not good: It Is spoken of the statutes of Omri, and all their Idolatrous
commands, which God gave them in judgment, and their lusts were drawn forth by
them, and they perished in them: For there is a reciprocation between the head
and the heart, and a constant communion. An evil heart commonly makes an evil
head, and then an evil head does very much add unto the ro^enness of the heart:
And by this means Deceivers in Judgment grow worse and worse; 1 Timothy 1.9.
Faith and a good Conscience must be kept together; and there is no hope of
keeping the one without the other; for a good Conscience is the vessel wherein
Faith is preserved, and if that be once split, Faith (that is the lading) will
suffer wrack; There must be a mutual preservation of both, for they must be
kept together, or they will surely be lost together.

Doct. 2.
Men take special care that the Word of God should be brought in to patronize
their lusts. They will be wanton, but they would also wrest and pervert the
word of God the Father, and have that countenance it.

First, Carnal Reason is lusts Councellor, and the strong Holds of sin lies
therein; (...)
It is a great Pleader for sin; Men sought out Inventions, Eccles. 7.29. 2 Cor.
10.5. there is a great contribution that corrupt reason gives to lust.

Secondly, But never so much as when it is from the Word of God, that being the
rule of a man's actions; let lust have something from it to satisfy it, and then
the man sins securely; it is true that of Romans 10.18. the Lord has stretched
forth the Expansum of his Word, and many men (it may be) will not dare to sin
with freedom against the aspects of it, etc. but if the Word do seem to
countenance it, and they can catch at any thing, it shall suffice; They wrost
the Scriptures to their own damnation, 2 Pet. 3.16. The Devil himself will come
with, It Is written: and the false Prophets, with Thus says the Lord, and then
men can sin securely, and without fear, because the Word does justify them,
and bear them out; and therefore the first, the most continued heresies that
can never be stubb'd up, but there are fibrae of them do appear in all ages; as
we see it in Arminianisme, Pelagisme; it is because they have much Scripture
that they can allege to defend it; the greatest plot that ever the Devil had:
and so it is with Popery, they will allege the same Scriptures together with us.

Secondly, The bitterest enemies that ever the Church of God had, have been
those that have owned the same Scriptures with themselves; as the Samaritans
and the Jews, and the Papists unto us; for hereby wickedness comes under the
title of a Duty, John 16.2. They shall suppose that they do good service: and
Paul says, I verily thought that I ought to do many things against the name of
the Lord Jesus; he did it in Duty, and did Sin conscientiously as I may say,
etc.

Use.
The Lord has given you Liberty in many things, such as we could not have
expected that ever our eyes should have seen done: Now let me exhort you, Do
not turn this Grace of God into vantonness: Use not your Liberty as an occasion
^o the flesh: Take heed of this way of sinning above all other, to make the
Word of the holy God a Patron of Lust, abhor those men above all other men,
next the Devil, that are best skilled in Scripture to this end, that they may
justify an evil way; Truly I shall say, better our old bondage or suffering
again, if this be the use we make of it, if our new liberty be a liberty in
sinning: One disputes for Free Will, and Universal Grace, and he has Scripture
for it; another he disputes against the regulating power of the Law, and he
has Scripture; another against Prayers but when the Spirit moves him, and he
has Scripture, another against the Sabbath; and others for all manner of
wickedness; for they say, we live in God: and others plead for swearing, for
it is an Ordinance of God; Thou shall swear by his Name: and others plead for
mixed multitudes in Ordinances, and they have Scripture; and others act for
every ignorant and confident fellow to preach in our public Congregations; for
say they, the Scripture says, as every man has received the gift, so let him
minister, etc. whereas we know the public ministry is an Office, and it is
committed unto some, and not to all, 2 Cor. 5.17.

Consider but these four things, and I have done.

First, Is this the return you make for all the goodness of God toward you?

Consider the evil of it; First, hereby you do dishonor God, in that which is
highest to him, and which he has most exalted next to his Son; Psalm 138.2. His
Word is exalted above all his Name: Now to lay the Word of God aside, and to
count it as a strange thing, Hos. 8.12. is a great evil; much more to turn it
against the Lord, and gather rules from the Word, to justify that which the
Lord himself abhors.

Secondly, Hereby you do gratify the Devil for that has been his great
Design: First, when the Lord has at any time powered out a higher measure of
light, as in Luthers time, then rose up abundance of heresies, and so in the
days immediately succeeding the Apostles, and when the Lord works any great
changes tending to Reformation, for cast Satan down in one kind, and he will
rise in another; as when Rome Pagan was cast down; now there is a flood upon
Rome Christian, etc. and by degrees, to be at last gathered together into the Sea of Rome.

Thirdly, No men brings on themselves greater destruction, then these men do,
who turn the grace of God into wantonness, by bringing into the Church damnable
heresies; 2 Pet. 2.3. (...), they are men ripe for destruction: and as I have
told you, the Lord will make it eminently appear, that they are the greatest
enemies to his glory, and his Churches good; and therefore God reserves them
for worse punishment then other wicked men shall have: God looks on them as men
of Blood, Bloody men, that are drunk with the blood of souls; the sons of
perdition, men of sin; it is an Hebraism that signifies an eminency in every one
of those kinds of sin, that wicked men are guilty of; and it is not only
reserved for them hereafter, God will not stay till he gives punishments and
rewards at the day of Judgment, as he will do to all men, both good and bad,
but they shall receive an earnest of damnation here in a special manner, as
well as hereafter; God will exalt their damnation above other men's;
Primogenitus Sathanae. Heretics are the first born of the Devil, and they
shall have a double portion with the Devil in his Inheritance.

Fourthly, This is a dangerous forerunner of destruction to any Nation or
Church: Truly if if you bear with the woman Jezabel, God will not bear with
you, for he is tender of his Truths, and prizeth them above all the world;
Heaven and Earth shall fail, before one tittle of that shall fall to the
ground; Christ made that the great sign of the destruction of Jerusalem, that
it was near, There shall arise false Christ's, and false Prophets many; and so 1
John 2.18. There are many Antichrists, and hereby we know it, is: (...): and
its not spoken of the end of the world, but of the destruction of the Jewish
state; and it drew very near upon this ground, because many Antichrists had
turned the grace of God into wantonness, and made use of the Word of Christ, to
the dishonor of Christ, in opprobrium Christi: and it was the over-spreading
of heresy that did give the Sarasins footing in the Eastern Empire; and seeing
they are willing to be deceived, the Lord let out that flood upon them;
therefore, oh all you that fear God, that desire to serve him as he has
revealed himself in his Word; whose spirits God has drawn forth to prize the
truth of the Gospel; Take heed of false Teachers: Hold fast the Faith that was
once delivered to the Saints. For if damnable heresies do creep in amongst you.
Consider nothing threatens destruction so much as they do.

THE Just Man's End:
AT THE Funeral of William Ball Esquire, a Member of the House of Commons.
ESAIAS 57.1. The Righteous perish, and no Man lays it to heart.


IN these words are four things to be considered. First here is a godly man
described in his life, and that either in respect of his inward disposition, or
his outward conversation. In his disposition of soul, he is a Righteous man
and a merciful man also. A Righteous man] he had need have good eyes that
finds out such a one; for Psalm. 53.4. The Lord looked down from Heaven upon the
children of men, and he found none righteous. Indeed in a legal sense there is
none, but has an allay in a Gospel sense, there is arighteousness that is
imputed upon justification, and there is a new image infused upon
sanctification; and both these must concur in the righteous man, and the
merciful man, (...) the man of mercy who has attained mercy himself, and who
is ready to show mercy unto others. The spirit of God came down in the likeness
of a Dove. A Dove as it is without guile, so is it without gall also; and a
righteous man is not only thus within, but in his conversation, his light
shines before men, he is always walking in his uprightness.

Secondly, In his death, and so he is said to perish, (...) the word in the
Hebrew is either put for temporal or eternal death. John 3.16. that they
should not perish but have everlas;ting life, but here it is meant of temporal
death, the disunion between the Soul and the Body, and so to perish is to dye,
Matthew 8.25. Master save us, else we perish. And it is said also they are taken
away, (...) in unum colligere: They are gathered unto their Fathers: here in
this world they are scattered, and some live in one place, and some in another,
but death is a gathering; and there is fasciculus viventium even a bundle of
the living: as the tares are bound in bundles so is the wheat also.

Thirdly, After his death: the Soul in this life is full of trouble: here in
this life but a little peace enters into him, my peace I give unto you, but,
then after this life he shall enter into peace; here, a little joy enters into
him, but then he shall enter into the Masters joy, for ever: and for their
bodies, they shall rest in their beds, as the grave is commonly called: it being
the sweet sleeping place, as 2 Chronicles. 16.14. it is said of Asa that he slept
with his Fathers; and they buried him in his own Sepulcher, and laid him in a
bed which was filled with sweet odors etc.

Secondly, Here is a public loss bewailed, the righteous perish, and there is
no man that does apponere cor. Mich. 7.1. woe is me for I am as the
Summer-gatherings; the good man is perished out of the Earth, the taking away
of the godly is the great loss and matter of great mourning unto those that
survive.

Thirdly, Here is a public and a common evil reproved, the foolish and
unthankful world is no whit affected with the loss of those of whom the Lord
says, the world was not worthy of: and this want of affection is grounded upon
the want of consideration, no man lays it to heart, no man understood that they
were taken away from the evil to come.

Fourthly, Here is a secret of providence discovered: godly men are taken away,
(...) a faciebus mali, from the evil to come: there being a storm coming, the
Lord does hasten to gather in the Corn into the barn, beforehand.

That I should speak unto al these, cannot be expected at this time; there are
only three points that I shall pick out of them all.

First, Godly men dye not as other men do: it is peculiar unto them, to enter
into peace, and rest in their bed, etc.

Secondly, Godly men are usually taken away in mercy, before an evil come.

Thirdly, When they are taken away, it should be unto them that survive, matter
of serious Consideration, Affliction, and Lamentation.

First, This is made the peculiar portion of the righteous and merciful men,
at their death, they shall enter into peace.

Doctrine.
Godly men dye not as others do; there is a great difference between them, and
others in their death.

There is indeed a great deal of difference between men in their lives: they
are men of another spirit, of another generation, they walk by other
principles, they aim at other ends, they live upon other comforts then others
do, and therefore they are men of another value, and esteem, they are the
excellent ones; when the greatest amongst men (if they be wicked) are vile
persons, they are amongst men, as gold amongst the dust of the Earth, and as
diamonds amongst the common pebles in the streets.

But the great and the grand difference between them is in their deaths, there
is something in a special manner in death peculiar to the Saints, and this we
are specially to observe. Psalm. 37.37. the end of that man is peace: this
Balaam could observe Numb. 23.10. There is a death peculi^r to the righteous,
Proverbs 14.32. The wicked shall be cast away in his wickedness, but the
righteous has hope in his death: The opposition shows the difference. When a
godly man shall be gathered, a wicked man shall be destroyed, cast away; and
when the godly man dies, he dies in hope, but the wicked man at death he
breaths out his soul, his life, and hope together.

But seeing they do both dye, the righteous man as well as the wicked; we see
also that wise men dye as well as those that are foolish: and for the manner of
their death, to outward view there is a great resemblance: Eccles. 2.16. as
dies the fool, so also dies the wise man: yet there is a great difference;
Ahab, and Josiah, a wicked, and a gracious King, they both dyed and for the
manner of their deaths, it was much alike, they dyed both in War, with the same
words in their mouths, turn thy hand for I am wounded; and yet its said of the
one, he dyed and was gathered to his fathers in peace, though he dyed in War.
What is therefore in death that is peculiar to the Saints? how dies the wise
man? this will be seen in three things. First, in respect of the persons dying,
Secondly in respect of death it self, Thirdly in respect of the fruit and the
consequence of death.

First, In reference unto the person dying, for a godly man dies in the Lord.
Rev. 14.13. he does sleep in Jesus, 1. Cor. 15.18. which implies two things.
First an union with him, a being in him,

Secondly, A dying in him, by the power and efficacy of the same union: now we
do not only read in Scripture of our being in Christ, but also living in him,
working in him, bearing fruit in him etc. Now a man does live in Christ, when
by the Almighty working of the Spirit of Christ the Graces of Christ appear in
him, and he lives no more, according to Men in the Flesh, but according to God
in the Spirit: so we are said to die in him, when by the Power of the Spirit of
Christ, by virtue of our union with him, we do exercise these dying graces that
were in Christ; for their be in him living, and dying, doing, and suffering
graces; and when by virtue of our Union living by the faith of the son of God,
a man does exercise these Graces, then is a man said to dye in Christ, work in
him, suffer in him, live in him; so that a godly man dies in the Lord, he is
one with him, and even in death, the Mystical union is not dissolved, and the
dying graces that were in Christ, and which a Saint does receive by virtue of
union with him, those graces he does exercise as Christ does, for he dies in
him.

Secondly, He dies in Faith, First in respect of himself; he believes that
death shall be unto him a blessing, and not a curse: 1. Cor. 3.23. all things
are yours (that is) in ordine ad spiritualia, whether life or death, 2 Timothy
4.8. Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness. 2. Cor. 5.1.
We know, that if this Earthly house of our Tabernacle were disolved, we have a
building with God etc.

And toward the time of a Saints death, Faith commonly puts forth the most
glorious acts, the Sun shines brightest at its setting: so that the soul can
say with Ambrose, nec pudet vivere, nec piget mori, etc.

2 In respect of the Church: though he never lives to receave the promises, nor
to see them accomplished, yet as they have exercised faith upon the great
things promised, and have laid up prayers for after times, so they dye in the
faith of them, that they shall be fulfilled in their season, Heb. 11.23. God
will surely visit you, says Joseph: and therefore what difficulties soever
they see raised against it, yea the Archers shoot at the Church, yet his bow
abode in strength, his faith holds out, and can look through all opposition
whatsoever.

3 For their posterity: Men are commonly troubled, what shall become of the
little ones they leave behind fatherless and friendless Orphans: but his
fatherless children he can leave with God, and the widow that trusts in God
shall not be forsaken: although my house be not so with God, yet he has made
with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure, etc. Luther in
his Will says, Lord thou have given me wife and children. I have neither Land
to bequeath them, nor houses, nor portions to leave them: only tibi reddo,
nutri, doce, serva, ut hactenus me, pater pupillorum, and judex viduarum.

Thirdly, The dye in obedience to God: Obedience is not real, if it be not
universal; a submission to the will of God in doing as well as suffering; in
dying, as well as in living: Romans 14.8. None of us lives to himself, nor none
of us dies to himself: but whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether
we dye, we dye unto the Lord; for grace having made God a man's utmost end, it
is his glory; and a submission unto his will, that is the great th ing in that
man's eye, whether in living, or in dying: if God will further use him, he is
content to live; and if the Lord will translate him, he desires to dye; and so
God may be glorified in him whether in life or death, he passes not: and when
he has honored God in his life, he desires that he may honor God in his death
also.

2 In reference unto death it self: and so there is something peculiar to the
death of the Saints: take these three things:

First, Though death in it self be a fruit of the Curse, yet unto him it is
turned into a blessing; though it be a curse in the thing, yet it is a blessing
to the man; because he having his Covenant changed, he is delivered from the
Curse, Christ being made a curse for him: A Curse has two things in it:

First, something that is evil in it self:

Secondly, The wrath of God therein.

Now unto the Saints death is not evil, and therefore they have desired it: I
long to be dissolved and to be with Christ, neither is it a fruit of Gods
displeasure to them, but it flows from his fatherly, and eternal love, that it
may be a passage unto a better life; whereas all other men dye by virtue of
that ancient Curse; The day thou eatest thereof thou shall dye, and in death
the wrath of God abides upon them.

Secondly, Unto the Saints death has no sting 1 Cor. 15.55. Death is compared
to a Serpent, which by nature we fear, and fly from, and the thing that is
dreadful in it is the sting: but if that be taken out, there is no fear of the
serpent now the sting of death is sin; and this is taken off by the surety, 2
Cor. 5.21. for he has made him to be sin for us; and therefore there is no sin
stands upon our score, that should cause us to fear the serpent for ever: but
other men dye in their sins, Joh. 8.21. and have all their sins to answer for
before the judgment seat of Christ; and not a drop of his blood shall take one
of them off his score.

Thirdly, Over the Saints death has no dominion, Romans 5.14. (...). Now what is
it that does constitute death in dominion? that is, when it can put forth its
utmost power, and there is none to control it, but there comes upon a man,
quicquid mortis est usque ad novissimum, it has a power to keep them under for
ever; but unto the Saints the dominion of death is controlled; for death entered
by sin, and it reigns by it: therefore when the dominion of sin is broken, the
dominion of death is also so; and the Saints are freed from the dominion of him
that (as an executioner) has the power of death, that is, the devil, Heb.
2.15. Psalm. 49.14. but for wicked men, death shall feed on them, and there is
none to deliver them; but for the Saints, the gates of hell shall not prevail
against them. I know that there is a Dalile interpretation commonly given and
received from that scripture, Mat. 16. First, gates is put for the power of
hell, because the strength of Cities was in their gates; but surely, this seems
not to be the meaning, for by gates of hell is meant that power which should
oppose the Church, and surely gates by their strength might be for defense unto
them, but not for offense: unto them without they were propugnacula, non
^ppugnacula, they did not fight with gates. Secondly, Anciently Councils did
usually sit in the gates, and so it signifies all the council and the policy of
hell, but that also seems not well to agree with the word (...) here used,
which signifies to prevail and overcome by power, not by policy; by strength,
and not by art: but that which prevails most with me, is, that our Divines have
commonly asserted against the local distance, that (...) is never put for Hell,
or the place of the damned, but either for the grave, or the state and
condition of the dead: and if that ^e true, then we read of the gates of the
grave, Job 38 17. Isai. 38.10. of the power of the grave; to keep those that
are under its possession, and so Christ does argue from the greatest to the
least; no enemy shall pre^ail, because even when you are brought under the
Dominion of death, and the power of the grave, yet you shall have a glorious
Resurrection, and the grave shall ^ive up its dead: and being risen you shall
dye no more, ^th shall no more have Dominion over you, the gates of ^e grave
shall not be able to prevail against you: and ^erfore no other opposition or
temptation whatsoever; ^meron. --

Lastly, In respect of the Consequences, and Issues of ^ath, so also there is
something in death peculiar to he ^ints: First, by death they are delivered
from the pow^ of Satan^ grace here in this life does free a man from ^e
Dominion of Satan; but it does not free him from ^s temptations, and to be
continually annoyed, with the ^llutions and suggestions of this unclean spirit,
for the ^cked one to touch them, 1 John 5. tactu qualitati^o; is ^e great
affiction of their lives: and it is that wherein ^eir spiritual warfare does
mainly lie: it was not the ^st part of the humiliation of Christ, for Sa^an to
have ^ch an access to him, and to propose such suggestions, ^s, (...) this will
I give thee if thou will fall down and worship (...); when he had but only an
access unto Christ, by representations from without; and not by suggestions
within; but he has by reason of the darkness that is in us, a more immediate
access unto our spirits; but our warfare shall be at an end, and we shall be
for ever freed, not only from the dominion, but the temptation of Satan
forever: Christ makes use of the Angels in Ministerium, and the devils in
exercitium -- but both, but for the time of this life, and no more: and
therefore in the world to come, after death, there shall be no more of either
to the Saints for ever.

2. From the being and in-dwelling of sin: which is the great misery that the
Saints complain of Romans 7.24. but he that is dead is free from sin, that
natural fountain of corruption, original sin, shall be perfectly dried up; and
the soul shall never think a vain thought, never speak an idle word, any more
for ever: nay, they shall not only be freed from sin actually as Adam was; but
even from a possibility of sin also; that as the wicked after death are given
up to sin as part of their torment, and are in malo obfirmati, so the Saints
shall be in bono confirmati: not only they shall not sin; but be freed from
the fear of a possibility to sin for ever.

3 For the perfection of their grace; the Saints have here, the first fruits of
the earnest of glory; and that is so precious to them, that they sell all to
buy it, and count all things loss and dross in comparison of it: and yet still
there are many (...), things wanting in their faith and their love, etc. but 1
Cor. 13.10. then that which is perfect will come, and that which is but in part
shall be done away; and these first fruits shall be swallowed up of glory.

4 They shall be with Christ, and receive the reward that he has prepared for
them; they shall enter into their masters joy: here in this life Christ is said
to be with us, but after this life, we are said to be with him, yea to be ever
with him: he shall never hide his face more; but it shall be communion without
intermission, and without interruption for ever, says Bernard: Christus est cum
Paulo magna securitas; Paulus est cum Christo summa faelicitas. --.

If a little of the presence of Christ be so sweet here, when we have it in his
spirit; O what will his eternal presence in glory be? thus dies the wise man;
thus he enters into peace: thus he rests upon his bed, having walked before God
in uprightness.

2. Doct.
When the righteous man dies, he is taken away from the evil to come: the Lord
had formerly told them, that evil was prepared, a sword was already barhed in
heaven, to make a sore slaught^r; and in verse 9. of the former chapter, the
Lord invites the beasts of the field to come and take their part of the prey;
now these are some, that the Lord will hide in the day of his wrath, Zeph. 2.3.
the Lord has a double hiding place for his people in evil times; sometimes he
hides them in his pavilion, and the secret of his Tabernacle upon the earth;
his chambers of peculiar providence; and sometimes, he hides them in the grave,
even the chambers of death, in which in times of affliction Gods people do
desire to be hid, Job 30.23. and many of them are hid in me^cy from the evil
that is coming on the ear^h. Thus when a flood came upon the world. God
provided an Ark for Noah: and as he had an Ark for Noah, so he had a grave for
Methusalah, who is conceived to be taken away the same year that the flood came
upon the earth. Gods usual course is, either his people shall stand in the gap
to turn away his wrath and his judgments, which sometimes are deferred for the
elects sake and, if the Decree of God be gone forth, and the judgment must
come, then the Lord takes his people out of the way before it come; so the Lord
dealt with Hezekiah, he defers the judgment till after his death, there shall
be peace and truth in his days, and Josiah, the Lord says to him, because thy
heart was tender, Thou shall be gathered to thy grave in peace, and shall not
see the evil that I will bring upon this place and the inhabitants thereof:
therefore the Lord, Rev. 19.13. having described the rise of Antichrist, and
the general pollution and corruption that should follow; all men should worship
the beast and wonder after him; blessed are the dead, (...) from henceforth;
were they not blessed before? yes all that dyed in the Lord are blessed from
the beginning of the world; but now, to be taken away in a time of so great
trial, it is a more special mercy; upon these three accounts chiefly.

1 That they may be preserved from the pollution of the times in which they
live: therefore the Lord takes them away; it is a very hard matter for Gods
people to live in times exceedingly evil, and yet to pass through such times
(...) unspotted, and and not to have a taint and tincture of the present
corruptions upon them, to keep their garments white^ now that the Lord may
preserve his people unspotted from the world, he does translate them before
hand, takes them away from the evil to come.

2 The Lord takes them away, that they may be freed from the vexations that his
people are in, when the abomination of desolation is set up; as Lot when he
lived in Sodom, they vexed his righteous from day to day with their ungodly
deeds. Gods people are mourners in Sion, and they do with that their eyes were
a well of water, to weep for the sins, as well as for the sufferings of the
times: and the Lord sees that their spirits cannot bear such dishonor, as is
done to his great Name; and therefore he takes them away beforehand to better
company: even the souls of just men made perfect.

3. God takes them away from the persecutions, and afflictions of the times:
for he knows our frame, and in all our afflictions he is afflicted; therefore
the Lord does as we our selves would do in the same case; if we had a child
abroad at school, and we did foresee some great evil either of pestilence, or
famine to be near unto that place where the child was; we would send for the
child home beforehand, that he might not partake in the misery with the rest;
so God has put his people to nurse, to school in this world; and if there be
evil near, he does send for his people home, beforehand, and cause them to go
forth out of the world, to pr serve them from the evil of it.

3. Doct.
Therefore, when godly men are so taken away, it is matter of serious
consideration, and high lamentation unto them that survive; and its their sin
if they do it not: it is that which David does complai^ of and bewail, Psalm.
12.1. there is not a godly man left, and the faithful fail amongst the children
of men; and they were wicked ones that were exalted on every side; Mic. 7.1.
the good man is perished out of the earth; the godly men were taken away, so
that when the Prophet did come to seek them, he was as men that did seek grapes
after gleaning, found here and there one; and as one that seeks the first ripe
fruits, but finds none; for the good man is perished, and there is none upright
amongst men; for they all do lie in wait for blood, every man hunts his brother
with a net; and when the world is preparing their nets to catch the Saints,
then God withdraws them from the world; and their loss should mightily assect
us: Consider these three things;

First, The Saints are our glory; as they are Gods Jewels, so they are the
excellent ones of the earth, and so they should be to us: 2 Cor. 8.23. it is
said, they are the messengers of the Churches, and the glory of Christ; and
those that Christ glories in, we should also glory in: and as we should rejoice
in the addition of any one into the number of the Saints amongst us; so we
should look upon it with mourning, and grief of heart, that any of that number
be taken away: and the more useful any man is to the Church, the more honorable
he should be in your eyes: they are vessels of honor, sitted for the masters
use: Now as scandalous professors are spots in your feasts, so sincere ones are
stars; and it is a great abasement, and the ecl^psing of the glory of a Church,
to have an eminent light put out of it.

Secondly, When the Saints are taken away, it is a dangerous sign that wrath is
determined; because, the Lord takes away and withdraws the pillars of the
Earth, from off the earth: it was a sign that Samson intended the fall of the
house, when he plu^kt down the pillars; the Lord does commonly before judgment
come, make way for his indignation; and one special way by which he does it is
by taking away those that stand in the gap to divert it: the Lord may say to
Moses, let me alone; but yet Moses will still wrestle with the Lord: but when
Moses is gone, now who shall strive with God for his people?

Thirdly, All our protection, defense, and blessing depends upon the Saints
that are amongst us; for it is by their Covenant that the world stands, and
that all the Creatures are continued ^n their being: and let me tell you, after
the Lord has gathered in the wheat into his barn, it will not be long ere he
does burn he chaff with unquenchable fire; if he do but once say to his people,
Come ^e blessed; go ye cursed; to the wicked, they will quickly follow after:
and therefore they do so bewail the taking away of Elijah, as the Chariot of
Israel and the horseman thereof: their strength and their fence was gone: for
this is a truth, the strength of a Nation, next to God, lies in the Saints,
they are the shields of the earth: for if it be for their sakes that the world
stands; God will provide a place for them of safety, when the rest of the world
is consuming, as we see in Zoar, a place may be preserved for the sake of the
people of God: and indeed they are the partition wall between wicked men and
temporal wrath, yea and eternal wrath; it is the Saints that keep the wicked so
long out of hell: whatever the world thinks of them, they are a blessing to the
world, Genesis 12.2. Mic. 5.7. as the showers upon the grass are a blessing, so
are the Saints by their prayers, and their Counsels, and their pains, and their
gracious example, and holy conversation, every way a blessing: so that as
Nazianzen says of Julian when he was smitten and had a wound, it was to him
indeed Lethale vulnus; But, (...).

So we may invert it, and say this of a saint that dies, 'twas indeed a happy
wound for him, for to be with Christ is best of all: but though a saint have
advantage by it, yet it is a misery to the place, to the Church, to the
Commonwealth, where such a one lived; ^ea even the whole world is a loser by
the death of a saint, and therefore Judah was so sensible of the loss of
gracious Josiah, that they made a great public mourning, yea a yearly mourning
for a long time after: sine supplicationibus non staret mundus, is the Jews
proverb; the world is upholden by the prayers of the saints.

Use.
Hence learn, that the ways of holiness are the best ways; for that is the best
way that leads a man to the best end: there is a double goodness in holy
walking;

First absoluta: there is a goodness in it self, it being a conformity to the
good will of God.

Secondly, There is a goodness in hol^ness which is respectiva, in respect of
the end unto which a man is thereby brought: and we see, finis dat mediis
bonitatem amabilem. --

I know that the unworthy would have many prejudices against the ways of
holiness; the Saints in their lives, are afflicted and chastised every moment,
and they go mourning all the day long, and they cannot put themselves in the
glory of the world, cannot partake of the jollity of the times; as he says,
spiritus Calvinianus est melancholicus: but look not upon their outside, but
their inside; look not upon them in their life, but in their death; and then
let me tell the greatest gallant of you all, you will give a world to change
estates with them at their death, in whose life thou would by no terms be
conformable unto. What would Dives have given after all his glory, all his
delicacy, to have changed with Lazarus in his death? let it be your work
therefore to dye the death of the righteous: and to set this the more home upon
your spirits, take these four considerations.

1 Consider, the great end why we came into the world was, that we might learn
to dye well, for Heb. 9 27. it is appointed to all men once to dye; but death
comes not presently, and the end of a man's life is, that he may consider his
latter end, Deuteronomy. 32.29. men do not live here to get riches, and enjoy the good
things that are present, and the pleasures of sin are but for a season; this
life is but (...), the school of death, which teaches men how to dye.

2 It is the last act of a man's life, the close of all his actions; and for a
man in his life to burn as a Torch, to shine as a light, and afterward to go
out in a snuff, as the foolish Virgins, and the foolish Builders; in Jobs
affliction there was nothing desirable, but yet there was in the end which God
made with him, that which was very desirable: Julius Caesar when he was taken
in the Senate, he plucked down the robe he wore about him, Ut honest caderet.

It is the night that commends the day; mark the end of the righteous man, his
end is peace.

3 At death all outward excellencies will leave a man, Job 4.21. their
excellency goes away, and they dye without wisdom: for, though there be a
flower in the grass which has a glory in it, yet Psalm. 90.11. it quickly comes
to nothing: so shall all the excellencies that men so pride themselves in,
their learning, parts, wisdom and policy, knowledge in the Scripture, and in
the common works of grace, it is all but flesh, and will take its leave at
death; and it will be said of you, as one of the Ancients said of Caesar, who
was one of the greatest men in the world in his time; Ubi nunc pulchritudo
Caesaris? quo abiit magnificentia tua?

What is become of his glorious magnificence? his Armies, Triumphs, and
Trophies?

4 At death your eternal states are cast; it is aeternitatis ostium, the door
of eternity: there is a Double time set to the sons of men, 1 A time of
working. 2 A time of rewarding. A time of working: here they toil and labo,
urbut at death, the Lord does call the laborers to give them their hire; every
man shall have his penny; but after death comes judgment: there is no more time
of working, for after death remains nothing but judgment then for ever.

But what shall a man do, that he may be blessed in his latter end? I will set
before you these five things, and the Lord teach you to profit by them.

1 Let me exhort you to get union with Christ, and thereby, thou art translated
from death to life: for this is a truth: no man dies well, that does not dye in
the Lord. What a sad thing is it to think, that a second death must follow?
death rides before, and Hell follows after; nihil facit mortem malam, nisi quod
sequitur mortem, -- when death in sin went before, and eternal life is not
begun in thee.

2 Serve thy Generation, and thereby lay up a good foundation against that last
day, Act. 13.36.

Fight the good fight and finish thy course, be abundant in the works of the
Lord; Its said of Saul, Sam. 13.1,2. he reigned two years over Israel; he
reigned twenty years, but after he was rejected of God, no more is counted of
him: nor will it be unto all those that spend their lives unprofitably, that
are but as empty trees, only serve to cumber the ground, are unprofitable both
to God and man: vita fabula est, in qua non refert, quam diu, sed quam been. --

3 Number your days, and consider your latter end, with Joseph of Arimathea:
walk with thy Tomb. A man shall not need much Arithmtick to number his days,
they are so few, and yet he will need a great deal of grace to number them,
they are so evil: and so death shall come upon thee not as a stranger, but as a
friend, that brings peace along with him and rest.

-- 4 Exercise faith much on the dying graces of Christ and the promises the
Lord made, Ioh. 16. to all Christians, dying as well as living; of his fullness
we shall receive grace for grace: it is our business in this world, to be made
conformable unto Christ, not only in our life, but also at our death; and then
the Lord says of his people, they shall be mine, Mal. 3.17. what a glorious
creature will a Saint be in that day when God himself looks on him as a Jewel?
1 Cor. 3.21. all things are yours, then a Saint enjoys perfection enough when
he has a full possession of God, Psa. 16.11. in thy presence are fullness of
joys, and on thy right hand are rivers of pleasures for evermore: -- and then
when a Saint has such a glorious advantage by death shall not we say, blessed
are the dead which dye in the Lord? --

-- 5. Lay up a treasury of prayers, that thou may be fitted for this great
change: if a man be in any straight or any sad condition, nature will prompt
him to seek relief, and he will take any course that may deliver him out of it;
especially since God has made such a promise, Call upon me in a time of
trouble, and I will hear you: and if a man be so careful to avoid and prevent
these lesser changes, that they may not do him harm; how much more should he be
industriously careful touching this great change? Psalm. 34. the Psalmist begs
that he may know his latter end: Psa. 90.12. so teach us to number our days,
that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom: -- and therefore a man should lay up
a treasury of prayers in his life time, and they will be as so many comforts to
him on his death bed: he shall then have a gracious answer of all those prayers.

Use. 2.
-- Let us lay to heart the loss of the righteous man; that we be not guilty of
that sin condemned in the Text. I know it has been a thing condemned or at
least always suspected, funeral Panegyricks, as being a badge of the false
Prophet; and by a funeral Oration, we do as the Papists do, think to send souls
to heaven, after their death, even those that have been posting to hell all
their life: but yet, seeing the name of the righteous is as a precious ointment
poured out, and that precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of all his
Saints: -- and seeing it was an Ancient custom to do the Saints of God honor at
their death; I think it but our duty, to consider of our loss, in this brother
at this time, though it be but to carry a torch after him to his long home;
first, he was a man of a gracious spirit, in whom the Lord had wrought the good
work, and a through work of Regeneration: he was one, that feared God above
many; that had truly given up his name to Christ; one that had oil in his
vessel, and did not only shine by profession before men; one that was not
indulgent to himself in his own iniquity; did not hide a sweet morsel, but had
respect to all the Commandments, and hated every false way: Secondly, he was a
friend to Reformation, in the purity and spirituality of it; which consists,
not only in casting out the old rubbish of corruption in doctrine and worship,
but laying a new foundation; not only an outward Reformation of Ordinances,
but an inward reformation of members, Re. 11.1. The corruption of the Church is
so expressed;

There are many when God is about to reform his Church will bear the name of
Christians, Isa. 54.11,12. I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and thy
foundations with Saphyrs; when the Church of God sparkles in the eyes of the
world, as many times it does; it shall have many followers. There is says
Calvin, a double foundation: a foundation of doctrine on which the Church is
built; and of members of which the Church is constituted, and this he says, is
meant here: -- the Church shall not be built of every ordinary and
Common-stone, but new-Jerusalem shall be built with precious stones; and
without shall be dogs, and every one that loves and makes a lie; and in
comparison of what now it is, they shall be all eminent Saints then; as it is
said, thy people shall be all righteous, every one of them: and this will
distinguish in an eminent manner the Saints from the men of the world; and
therefore no wonder if godliness has so few friends in the world, Color omnibus
unus. --

-- 3 He was a man in all his relations of a very publik spirit; he was far
from making those private advantages to himself, that many do of kindred and
friends; he was one had impoverisht himself for the public service, to my
knowledge, and never sought, and professed never would, recompense from the
State. -- Many men will serve the kingdom whilst they serve themselves upon it;
and the while they serve the State, they have wrought well for themselves:
dives potestas pauperem facit Rem-publicam.

'Twill be an honor in after ages, that a man has made no advantage of his
public trust: -- when every man is making gain from his interest, to promote
himself and his family thereby.

4 He was a man very humble, of a meek, and a sweet temper; free from the
common bitterness that is in men; he had much of the Dove, and of dovelike
simplicity; and much of the wisdom, though very free from the craft of the
Serpent; a man full of sweetness and love: of an amiable and a winning
conversation, which surely are things, in the sight of God in great price.

5 He was a man of a very faithful spirit; which truly now is very hard to
find. We may well say, the faithful man is perished; falsehood is now grown the
wisdom, and the policy of the times; for men to pretend grace, and intend
nothing less; to look one way, and row another; to speak words smoother then
butter, when they have war in their hearts, and to betray his brother with a
kiss, and with Ioab stab him in an imbracement: and he that can carry it with
the greatest fairness and smoothness, is the wisest man; and this is the great
policy of our times.

6 Lastly, He was (and I wish all that are in places of trust would consider
this) exceeding industrious and active in the care of the public: much lay
upon him, he did not spare his pains, and his time, even to the neglect of his
own necessary affairs; yea, the necessity of nature, for a support of nature
many a time, as I can witness; and the sad condition of the kingdom lay very
heavy upon him; he was willing to his power, to put men a work, ere he had
wages for them, from the public: Many men are active, but it is, when there is
something to be gotten, that does oil their Chariot wheels; they love to tread
out the Corn, but to plow in hope; and to labor barely for the public good. I
fear there are but few such in the kingdom: I Will appeal now to you that knew
him: you know these things to be true; I doubt not but God has rewarded him
according to his works.

God with Us, whilst We are with Him.
At a public Fast before the Parliament. June 9. 1652.
2 Chronicles. 15.2. But if ye forsake Him, He will also forsake you.


THe Lord having rent the kingdom from Rehoboam, according unto the word that
he had spoken, and left him only two Tribes, that his servant David might have
always a light before the Lord in Jerusalem; this remainder of the kingdom did
he seek to establish and to strengthen himself in: but as Luther observes, qui
regit, signum est in quod Satan omnia jacula dirigit: therefore as he does of
men, endeavor to corrupt the first, the prime of their years; so he does also
to Magistrates, the prime of their Government, that he may lay corruption in
the foundation, and therefore he forsook the Law of the Lord, chapter 12.1. and men
in Authority sin not alone, principum delicta sunt plano diabolica. -- they
have many that fall with them: therefore it is said, that he did not only
forsake the Law of the Lord; but all I srael with him: having thus departed
from the Lord, they now betake themselves unto other Laws, having chosen unto
themselves other Gods; for they forsake God, that forsake his Law; and they
build high places, and Images, and groves upon every high hill, and under every
green tree, and there were Sodomites in the land also, who did according unto
all the abominations of the Nations, permittente Rehoboam: so also he did give
them a toleration: its true that he did not set them up by authority, but he
did connive at them, and let them alone: he did not look upon it as his duty to
use his Authority, and turn the edge of it against them; but there was
something else in it, for it was done nomine and praetextu religionis, Pet.
Mart. it being the way that the heathens did worship their Gods, and who shall
limit the Consciences of men? that way of worship which they shall think fit
that they are to use, and who shall control them? and so set themselves in the
place of God: if men, as Sodomites or Ranters, will worship God, who has power
to gainsay them? for uncleanness in opinion will soon bring in uncleanness in
conversation: and Abijam succeeded his father in all these abominations, for he
walked in all the sins of his father, that he had done before him; as Rehoboam
did in the abominations of the heathens, which the Lord had cast out before
them: for men may be the sons of those per imitationem, to whom by generation
they have no relation: and they that cast others out of authority, and yet be
their successors in the same abominations, they are in Gods account their sons,
though their posterity be disinherited by them: and this was the state and
condition of the kingdom when Asa came to the Crown; and he being a gracious
man, did turn from all the abominations of his fathers; and the land having
peace for the first ten years of his reign, he spent that whole time in
reformation: in reforming the corruptions of Religion, and thought himself as a
Magistrate so highly concerned in it, that he used his power to take away the
Altars of the strange Gods, etc. and his Authority was not only destructive,
as some would allow the Magistrates to destroy what they will, so they build
nothing; but it was astrictive also, for he commanded Jacob to seek the Lord
God of their fathers, and to do his Law and his commandments. This glorious
work of Reformation being begun, and for about ten years carried on (never was
any great work so begun in this world, but mighty mountains of opposition have
been raised against it): nowhere is an Army of Ethiopians raised against him,
the greatest that we read of in any story, of a thousand thousand; chap. 14.9
and though it may be it was not their direct aim to hinder the work of
Reformation, yet this (doubtless) was Satan's aim in stirring them up: for as
the aim of the good Angels is beyond that of the Instruments, which many times
they use, Dan 10. last, and when I am gone forth, lo, the Prince of Graecia
shall come, He shall fight with the Prince of Persia; but is overruled therein
to another end then himself intended; So is the aim of the evil Angels also;
but the Lord who delights in Reformation, and loves to see Temple-work go on,
will not suffer this good work to perish under so great an opposition; and
therefore this mighty Army shall not stand before a Reforming Prince, and a
praying people, but they were all smitten before the men of Judah, and they
returned home to Jerusalem laden with the spoil in great abundance. At this
time the Lord stirred up the spirit of Azariah the son of Obed, who went forth
to meet them, he preached this Sermon unto the King, and unto the victorious
Army: and he says, hear me O Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin. Gods Messengers
may require audience and obedience in the Name of God, from the greatest men
upon earth: and that, when they were in the height of their prosperity and
glory: for the Lord has exalted his word over Nations and kingdoms, to root
out, and to destroy, and to build, and to plant; and it is not the least charge
given against Zedechiah, that he humbled not himself before Jeremiah, the
Prophet speaking from the mouth of the Lord: for though the men dye, yet their
words will live: and it will asuredly overtake men, though they may seem for a
while to escape it; Zach. 1.6. Did not my words take hold of the fathers? the
sum of the Prophets Sermon is here laid down in three Doctrinal Propositions.

First, That the Lord is with You, whilst you are with Him.

Secondly, If you seek Him, He will be found of you.

Thirdly, If you forsake Him, He will forsake you.

Here is a Doctrinal Proposition, with a particular Application; the
Proposition is this, That they that do forsake God shall be forsaken of God. 2
The Application is, that if ye forsake God, he will also forsake you, that he
has so gloriously delivered, and for whom he has so eminently appeared,
riding upon the heavens, and his excellency on the sky, yet if he will turn
his hand and consume you after he has done you good; this is ^o perish with a
double destruction: as, for a man to dye after he has had some quickening works
upon him, is to be twice dead: so, for a man or a people to perish or be
destroyed after the Lord has done them good, and seemed to rejoice over them,
this is to perish with a double destruction.

For the opening of this Doctrine, there are four things in the Text, which are
to be considered. First we see, that the desertion of a people never begins in
God; the Lord does not forsake them, till they forsake him. There are two sorts
of acts that God exercises over men; some Actus dominii, acts of sovereignty:
Secondly, Actus justitiae: the one respects men as creatures, the other
respects men as sinners.

Preterition, is an act of sovereignty, and that begins in God: but desertion
is an act of Justice; and therefore must begin in us: for the cause of all
punishment, the meritorious cause, is to be found in the creature; and does
begin in us, and not in him. Its true, that all acts of mercy do begin in God;
and they have no ground in the creature: he loves us first, he shows mercy
freely, and what ever he does it is for his own sake, there is nothing in the
creature that procures it. The rise and foundation of mercy is in himself; but
acts of Justice have their rise from us: for he does in all judgments clear
this unto the creature, that he does not without cause any thing that he has
done: and the Lord says of all judgments, have thou not procured it to thy
self? is not this the wages that you have wrought, and labored for? is not
this the harvest which answers the seed that you have sown? for they that sow
to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption, etc. So that the Lord does
never reject us till we reject him; he does never forsake us till we forsake
him, Romans 6.23. the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life:
but acts of grace begin in God, and they are mere gifts, but all acts of
Justice begin in us, and are but the fruits of our own deservings: he rejects
us because we reject him first, etc. Secondly it may be supposed that they that
have had the Lord much with them, and have had great and eminent experience of
his presence going with them, yet they may forsake the Lord and depart from
him; Israel did so, they forgot God their savior who had done great things for
them in Egypt, wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the
Red sea, as Psalm. 10.6,21,22. and they that forget God will quickly forsake
God: a people may arise unto that foolish confidence in their own present
condition, that they may say, Ier. 2.31. We are Lords, we will come no more at
thee: a strange expression! and they may walk toward God, as if they were put
into such an estate, that they should now need God no more; but that they could
live without him: we have now no more need of fasting and praying; days of
humiliation may now be intermitted, for not only months, but years together.
What is this but for a people to say. We are Lords, we will come no more at
thee; we have not now the same need of God that we had in times past: 2 Chronicles.
26.15. Vzziah was marvellously helped till he was strong: but when he was
strong, his heart was lifted up unto his own destruction, Isa. 29.1. there is a
woe for Ariel, the City where David dwelt, which Mr. Calvin renders, the Altar
of God, because the Sacrifices and Ordinances of God were there; but others,
(and so in the Margent it is rendered,) the Lion of God, quia tanquam Leo Gentes
alienas subjugasset: -- None could stand before them; -- There is a woe for
them, because they had in the greatness of their strength and power, and
victories, forsaken the Lord; and therefore the Lord says he would bring
distresses upon them, that he had formerly been with, and they had conquered by
his power and presence: and they that in their pride did speak loftily as if
they had spoken from Heaven, the Lord says they should be brought down to the
ground, and their speech should be low as out of the dust.

Thirdly, Former duties, nor former mercies shall not serve men, but if they do
forsake the Lord, they shall be forsaken of him: first former duties will not
secure men: here is a gracious Prince that had labored ten years in the
Reformation of Religion, and that with great success, and had met with great
opposition, and yet with resolution gone through all, yet the Lord tells them,
that for all this, if after this they did forsake the Lord, he would forsake
them. There was in the days of Josiah, the most glorious Reformation of
Religion, that ever we read of in Judah, he was such a King as like unto him
was none before him, nor after him should arise the like: the people entering
into a solemn Covenant before God, that they would be the Lords people; and the
Reformation went farther, for it was the taking away of the High places also,
which other Reformers left standing: and they kept the Passover unto the Lord,
such a one as had not been since the time of the Judges, and yet 2 King.
23.26,27. notwithstanding the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his wrath.
Here is a sad and unexpected close of this famous story, and that not only for
old sins; but Zeph. 1. the Land continued in the same evils still, and
therefore the Lords controversy continued against them: there were the
remnants of Baal in the hearts of the people still, and there were those that
did swear by God, and by Malchom, that did endeavor so to keep up a mixture in
Religion; and those that were Apostates, and were turned back from the Lord,
and men that were settled upon their lees, that did say, the Lord will neither
do good nor evil, and for this cause will the Lord search Jerusalem with
Candles, etc.

2 Former mercies will not secure you, if you forsake the Lord. Its true that
former mercies are of a great engagement unto us to keep close to God: the
cords of love lay upon men the strongest bonds; but yet if they do not oblige
us, they are not binding unto God. Its true, that faith may make use of former
mercies, as an argument to a repenting and returning people, as Number. 14.19.
Pardon the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy,
as thou have forgiven this people from Egypt even until now, but it is no
prevailing Argument for a backsliding people; but the Lord will say, how long
shall I bear this evil Congregation? and therefore the word is gone out of his
mouth, and judgment shall the sooner and with the greater fury plead the cause
of abused mercy in former deliverances, Deuteronomy. 28.63. It shall come to pass that
as the Lord has rejoiced over you to do you good, so also the Lord will
rejoice over you to destroy you and to bring you to naught; the word (...) does
signify to rejoice, summo gaudio and incredibili laetitia. Answerable unto the
joy and delight which the Lord seem^d to take in blessing a people, and in
building them up; such will the delight be which he will seem to take in
ruining that people and destroying them. If you be not bound by the cords of
his law; let me tell you, he himself will never look upon himself as bound by
the cords of his law: if they be no engagement upon you, they will be found
none upon him in the end. Psalm. 120.4. it is by some understood of the slanders
of men; but it is by others understood of the judgments of God; there shall be
mighty and sharp Arrows, with coals of juniper, that is such as burn with
greatest fierceness, and longest lasting, and such as yield a sweet savor in
the burning; there is no destruction like unto that, when God shall delight to
destroy a people, he shall laugh at their destruction, and mock when their fear
comes. Fourthly, The Lord delights to deal with sinners in a way of proportion
and retaliation; according to their dealing with him; and there shall be the
Image of the sin in the judgment that shall be executed upon them: that the
Lord will but deal with them so, as they deal with him: if they forsake him;
this shall be their judgment, he will also forsake them. If men be invited to
the marriage feast of the Kings son, and they make excuses they will not come;
their judgment is, they that were ^idden shall not taste of my supper. If the
people of Israel will not (at the command of God) go up unto the land of Canaan
to take possession, they will not enter into Gods rest; the Lord says, nay, he
does swear in his wrath, that they shall not enter: and if in the days of their
prosperity, men will say to the Almighty, depart from us; in the same
proportion will the Lord say unto them in the day of their judgment, Depart
from me, I know you not. In those things wherein the sons of men are, and their
lusts acted and more drawn forth, in those the Lord does delight that their
judgment should be. The people of Israel were formerly weary of the Prophets,
as we now are of Ordinances, and they did say to them, prophecy not, and cause
the holy one of Israel to cease from us; therefore the Lord says, he will
cause the Sun to go down upon the Prophets, and he makes the day to be dark
about them, that there should be none that should understand or be able to tell
them how long: and when they desired Teachers according to their lust, and did
say, Speak to us smooth things, and prophecy deceit; these rough-spirited men
we cannot away with them: -- The Lord says, if any man will prophecy of wine
or strong drink, he shall be a Prophet unto this people; yea even in hell the
sins of men shall be their torment; and the Lord delights to make them so; it is
true, sin ceases there, as it is paenae demeritum: for judgment passes only
on men, for what is the flesh: but, not and paenae damnatio: for damnati
blasphemant Deum and in hoc peccant, sed peccata pertinent ad damnationis
poenam, etc. for what the Lord does, he does in high displeasure and
indignation, and that does delight him, (...) to retaliate, that men may
abundantly eat the fruit of their own ways, and be filled with their own
devices; and the Lord makes in this retaliation a greater speed with some men,
then he does with others, answerable to the Mercies bestowed, and abused: some
men's sins are as a basket of Summer-fruit: quia maturitatem suam sunt assecuti
-- Am. 8.12
Drusius: -- they that have stood long under mercies, and under Ordinances,
they do ripen the sooner, and the Lord will surely hasten his work upon such a
people: habet sapientia justitiae sua compendia; the Lord knows how to finish
the work, and to cut it short in righteousness: for a short work does the Lord
intend to make in the land, Romans 9.28. How long soever the work be that God
makes with any other people, yet with an unthankful people, that lives in high
abuses of goodness, he will surely make a short work with them. Fifthly, At the
same time when we begin to forsake God, he does begin to forsake us; for so
much must be taken from the beginning of the verse, the Lord is with you,
whiles you are with him: so we and some others render it, dum fuistis --
Therefore the same date that our departing bears unto God, the same also does
the Lords departing bear unto us; at the same time when the Prodigal did but
set the first step to return to his father, the father did set forth to meet
him: and at the same time that any man departs and turns away from God, at the
same time does the Lord turn away from him also, and though it be not presently
visible; for our Apostasy from God is first in the inward man, our souls draw
back from him; Jer. 6.8.
at the same time also his soul departs or is dis-joynted from such a people:
and in such cases the Lord is very exact in observing of the time, he keeps an
account of it unto a day, as we see it in Saul, 1 Samuel 13 13,14.
Now would the Lord have established the kingdom upon Israel for ever, but now
thy kingdom shall not continue; now Saul departed from the Lord, and from this
time forth the Lord did forsake him: and therefore 1 Samuel 13.2. it is said that
he reigned but two years over Israel, that is, Legitime and non rejectus a Deo,
so Jun^post biennium a Shemuele fuit: so that though the kingdom did continue
so many years after, or he continued in the kingdom, yet he reigned as King but
two years, now he rejected God, and now the Lord re^ected him from being King
over Israel: and though men discern it not, yet there are symbolical precepts,
by which the Lord does try men even at this day; the Lord puts them upon such a
business, puts such power, and such authority into their hands, which they
abusing, and their heart, departing from God in it, they are under an evil
aspect from God from that time forward; that though their lives may continue,
and though they may for a time continue in their authority, yet from that time,
he Lord departs from them, and they do by degrees wither and decay insensibly;
degenerate in their zeal for God and his people. Sad are the Records and the
aspects of God upon great men in this kind; such a day I tried a man's integrity
and his fai^hfulness, I put power into his hand to honor me with it, and yet
his spirit departed from me, his heart was false and unstable with me;
therefore, from that day my soul is disjoynted from such a man, will honor him
no more: Saul reigned long after before the people; but, from that time, no
longer in Gods account.

Sixthly, In the same degree that a people do forsake the Lord, will the Lord
also forsake them: and so much the Hebrew word also does seem to import in
existendo vos cum eo, in your being with him, he will also be with you, and in
your forsaking of him, he will also forsake you. The Lord departs from a people
gradatim by several removes, to see if there be any that will stir up
themselves to take hold of God. As the glory of the Lord departed from the
Temple, Ezekiel. 10.11. first he goes up from the Cherubins unto the threshold,
and from thence to the middle of the City, and from the City unto the Mountain:
and these removes of God from us are answerable unto the degrees of our
departing from him: for in these things the Lord does exactly observe a
proportion. As it is in the matter of outward afflictions, so it shall be also
in spiritual desertions: Ezekiel. 7.16. as pride does bud, so the rod does
blossom; violence does rise up unto a rod of wickedness: their rod is taken out
of their own sins: their own wickedness does correct them: and answerable to
the growth of sin in them, so does the rod grow for them, that it may be
corrected. And so it is in desertion also; with the upright the Lord will show
himself upright: if men's hearts be wholly with him, he will be perfect and
entire with them: but if men be for God only in show, he will be for them and
with them only in show: if they give unto him only outward obedience, he will
give unto them only a temporal reward: if they do offer unto God but external
service, and that which is seemingly service, but really a sin; he will bestow
upon them outward blessings, that is, that which shall be seemingly a blessing,
but really a curse: a blessing in the thing, but a curse to the man. For the
Lord will hold a proportion: as we forsake him, so he will in the same measure
and degree, forsake us also. All the children of destruction, are not born at
once, Hos. 1.
the first is Iezreel, and the last Loammi; yea and Gods own people answerable
unto their departing from God, so they shall find the Lords withdrawment from
them; David had his first ways, 2 Chr. 17
and the people of God have their first, Rev. 2.4. and they that do decline
from God in holy obedience, they shall find the Lord will depart from them in
reference to a gracious presence: it shall not be with them as it has been in
times past: they shall remember with bitterness after their departure from
their former husband, that it was better with them then it is now.

2. Let us now look upon the grounds of this Doctrine, that upon our forsaking
of God he will forsake us; and they are different, according unto a double
state of men in this life: some are in a state of Nature; and some are in a
state of grace.

First they that are in a state of nature forsaking God, shall be utterly
forsaken by him, and that for ever; for the Lord does deal with men according
to the tenor of the Covenant, under which he stands; in all his
administrations, he is always mindful of his Covenant. Now all men in a state
of Nature, are under a Covenant of works; for though this Covenant were broken
in the fall, yet it was not abolished, but stands in force still unto all
unregenerate men, to the end of the world; its true, that being become weak
through the flesh, it can give life no more, Romans 8^3. but it commands duty as
perfectly as it did unto Adam in the state of innocence; and so far as a man
falls short of perfect and personal obedience, so far he sins, and it threatens
a Curse as dreadfully now, as it did in the state of innocence: and it is by
virtue of this Covenant that sin is bound upon the Consciences of ungodly men
for ever: and by virtue of this Covenant the Curse comes upon them in this
life, in a degree, and hereafter in the perfection thereof. Neither is that
Arminian Doctrine to be received, Lex prima cessabat primo foedere rupto per
inobedientiam primi hominis; that men being constituted under the Curse, the
first Covenant being broken, all the debt of legal obedience which the
creatures did owe unto God, did immediately cease; for then, there should have
been no sin after the first sin; for if the Law ceased, there could be no
transgression: neither is it any way answerable unto Reason or Scripture, that
because man had lost his ability to obey, therefore God should lose his
authority to command. Now in the first Covenant God dealt with man by way of
retaliation, Genesis 4.7. if thou do well, shall thou not be accepted? the best
services must needs be rejected for the least failing; therefore in the
creatures departing from God, he will also depart from him: and by the terms of
the Covenant he is bound, if they forsake him, he must also forsake them: his
Justice and truth do bind him unto it: and according to that Covenant, it is,
bonum ex integro constat; malum ex quolibet defectu.

2 There are some men in a state of Grace, and the change of their estate
depends upon the change of their Covenant: such a man's state is as is his
Covenant under which he stands. He that is in a state of Grace, is therefore
translated into the Covenant of Grace; and then all the dealings of God with
him are answerable unto the tenor of the same Covenant: and this Covenant is an
everlasting Covenant, for he will write the law in their hearts, and put his
fear so into them, that they shall not depart from him, Jer. 32.20. and
therefore he will never forsake them utterly: for he has said, he will never
turn away from them to do them good. We are far from that Doctrine as to
conclude from hence, that the interchange of members between Christ and Satan,
is frequent and ordinary; and that as Christ takes members from Satan, so does
Satan also take members from Christ; that a man may be a member of Christ to
day, and a child of the devil to morrow; now in a state of Grace, and by and by
in a state of sin; beloved of God to day, and forsaken of God to morrow; for we
read, that whom he loved once he loved unto the end; for he loves them not with
a temporal, but with an everlasting love: and as in reference unto a man's
eternal condition, there is a gulf fixed, which notes Calv.
aeternitatem status; so there is in reference to the change of a man's
Covenant, a gulf fixed; and it is as possible for the creature to pass from
Heaven to hell; as it is for a man according to the rules of the word of God,
who is under the Covenant of Grace to pass afterward, or ever to return into
the Covenant of works: yet, under the second Covenant, though there be not a
final forsaking, yet there may be a real, and a gradual desertion: as well as
affliction, is compatible with the state of a son. I will visit their offenses
with the rod, but my loving kindness I will never take from them, nor suffer my
faithfulness to fail: I was wroth and smote him, and hid my face, etc. my
beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone, etc. and there is a real
displeasure, though it be Cant. 5.
Ira paterna, non hostilis; and there is a desertion not only in point of
consolation, but in point of sanctification also; that when a man comes to
resist sin, or to perform duty, he shall not find the same presence, nor the
same assistance, that he formerly had: men may go forth in the strength of
Grace received, and they may with Samson think to do as in times past; but if
they turn aside from the Lord, they shall find that the Lord is departed from
them: for it is not being in a state of Grace, that carries the actual presence
of God with a man, but it is acting those graces that he has received, and
walking answerable unto that estate: Joh. 14.23.
If a man love me and keep my words; my father will love him, and we will come
to him and make our abode with him; he will love him; we cannot love him unless
he love us first; there is a love of benevolence which begins in God, and has
respect unto nothing in the creature; but there is a Love of complacence, which
though it flow from free Grace, yet it is acted answerable unto the Image of
God in the creature, and as the creature walks with God, and is serviceable
unto his great ends; there is a presence of God with us answerable to our care
of keeping Communion with him: if a Godly Magistrate shall with Solomon, have
his heart departing from the Lord, though the Lord have appeared to him twice,
and has given him formerly very gracious and signal testimonies of his
presence with him, if he shall turn aside unto crooked ways, he will surely
fail of his former presence, and assistance in his Government: a man's right Arm
will wither, and his right eye will be put out: he shall neither have that
wisdom in his Government, neither shall he have that Authority and ruling power
in the hearts of the people; and the reason is, because God is not with him as
in times past: but he having forsaken God, he is forsaken of God: and if a
Godly man whose soul is become an habitation of God through the spirit, shall
now forsake the fountain of living waters, and shall dig to himself broken
Cisterns, shall let his heart go out to the Creatures, and shall forget the
Lord, and his heart sit loose from him; he shall find that the Lord will
withdraw himself, that he shall not have that assistance in services, nor that
comfortable and fruitful presence in all his ways, but he shall in a measure
walk without God in the world, even as the men of the world do: and if a state
that have had a glorious presence of God with them, that the Lord has made
bare his Arm in the sight of the Nations, so that the fear of them has fallen
upon all the Nations round about, because they saw that God did fight for them,
the Lord has gone before them, and the God of Israel was their rereward; and
therefore he has given them the necks of their enemies, and no weapon formed
against them has prospered; every tongue that did rise up in judgment against
them has he condemned: but if this state shall now fall in love with her own
beauty and greatness, and shall say this is Babel that I have built, and my
hands have gathered the riches of the Nations, if this state shall now trust in
an arm of flesh and say we will have no more care of the truths of God, and the
Ordinances of God, they are upon Civil and Politic respects that we stand; the
Lord will surely depart from them: if they shall say, we are Lords, we will
come no more at thee; their Rock will sell them: their wonted presence will
depart from them, and the Lord will take pleasure to bring them down whom he
has before exalted, and to destroy them after he has done them good.

3 Yet for the further opening of this point, it is necessary that we discover,
what it is for a person or people to forsake the Lord, and what it is for God
to forsake them, and when he is said in Scripture so to do?

First, What it is to forsake God, and when the Lord is said to be forsaken.
First, they that forsake the Law and truths of God, forsake God; wicked men
that live without God are described by Psa. 119 5^.
forsaking the Law of God, the wicked that forsake thy Law, Jer. 9.13. they
have forsaken my Law which I set before them, and have walked after the
imaginations of their own hearts, and after Baalim which their fathers taught
them, etc. For it is God that we have to do with in the word: the word is
mighty, Heb. 9.12 13.
and all things are open and naked before him with whom we have to do;
therefore the word has (as it were) the properties of God attributed unto it,
it is (...), a discerner of the secret thoughts and intents of the heart, which
belong unto God only: but it is not from the power of the word alone, but from
the presence of God therein; for in the word it is, him with whom we have to
do: therefore if in the word we have to do with God, then they that do forsake
the word of God, forsake God: and men do forsake the Law of God; first when
they depart from the foundation: there is a twofold foundation that the
S^ripture holds forth; fundamentum doctrinae, and personae. -- its true, a
personal foundation can no man lay, any other then what is laid, Jesus Christ:
but there is also a doctrinal foundation, which is called the foundation of the
Apostles and Prophets, Ephesians. 2.20.
and this is that pattern of wholesome words that (...). that form of Doctrine,
and that which the Apostle mentions of the foundation which he himself has
laid, Heb. 6.1. and this the Church of Christ in the purest times shall not
depart from, for Rev. 21.14. the walls of the City shall have twelve
foundations, and upon them written the names of the twelve Apostles of the
Lamb, etc. that Ancient standing of Truth, let it be preserved, and all
superstructures, let them tend to the clearing and establishment, and not to
the subverting of them; let men build as high as they can, so as they hold the
foundation; sit vere profectus fidei, non permutatio: Lyren. And in this the
people of God have been always fearful; quo quis sanctior, eo promtior novellis
adinventionibus contraire, etc. we are now quite contrary: the more holy any
man seems to be, the more open h^s ears are, and the more ready he is to close
with every novelty, or call all into question; Satan's great design in this age,
is, to keep all men in uncertainties: two ways Satan has, one way in the time
of peace, and another in the time of persecution; in the one cogit homines
negare Christum, in the other docet, Austin; he does force them in the one, he
does teach them in the other: but his great aim is at fundamentals; for there
is such a connection of these, that a man cannot deny one, but he overthrows all
the rest. It was the rule that Luther gave, Spiritus Sanctus scepticus non est,
and therefore it is to be feared, that under these great pretenses of the
Spirit, there is very little of the Spirit of Christ in men; when it tends to
Skepticism, not to Christianity.

Secondly, Men forsake the Law by putting false interpretations; for he that
has not the spiritual and true sense of the Law, is without the Law, Romans 7.9.
Psalm. 11^
and so men are said to make void the Law of God; (...) it is not Palam and ex
professo, but it is fecretly and under hand, (...) ye have unlorded the Law by
your traditions: -- and they that take away the mind of the Law they do destroy
the Law; and this is the greatest sacrilege in the world; men are called, by
Nazianzen, (...),

They that do steal away the sense of the Scripture from the words of the
Scripture, and take them not according to the scope of the place, or the
intention of the spirit of God in them, but in Allegories and mystical senses;
now this way, and then another, as it chimes into their fancies. We blame the
Papists for making of the Scripture a nose of wax; if ever it were so, it is so
made by many of our Teachers at this day: and by this means, it shall serve to
usher in and to patronage any invention that our own hearts can present unto
us; there are great pretenses of love now held forth, that men should love one
another, though they differ in opinion, upon the point of saintship, etc. the
same thing we also say and press, that we love one another, but let it be with
the Apostles assertion, 2 Ioh. 6. This is love, that we walk after his
Commandments: and let it be also with the Apostles Injunction (...), truth it
in love: Ephesians. 4.15
-- steal not away Truth from us under the shows and pretenses of love: in vain
have the endeavors of Conciliators, been that have sought to unite men, whose
principles in respect of Truth were contrary. It is a great honor to be as
Nazian. of Athanasius, he was dissentientibus magnes, etc. but yet so as we are
to consider, that Truth is primo-primum in Religione: without which all motives
unto union though in a moral construction good, and coming from a good
intention, will never prove in any measure effectual: it is speaking Truth in
love, that will only make men grow up into one body in the Lord; and it was
the dishonor of that great power, Rev. 9. that though they had faces like men,
and the teeth of Lions, a great show of meekness, and yet abundance of
stoutness and courage joined with success in all their undertakings, for they
were crowned Locusts; yet they had a sting in their tails, diabolicam and
pseudo-Propheticam propaginem denotat: all the power of their Conquest was used
to no other end, but to leaven and poison all places where they came and
conquered with their corrupt opinions: whoever they be that use their power in
this manner, be their success what it will be, they are in judgment, and for
the Torment of all where they come, and such Locusts proceed out of the smoke
of the bottomless pit.

Secondly, They forsake God that forsake his worship: ye are they that forsake
the Lord, that forget his holy Mountain, to prepare a Table for that host, etc.
Isa. 65.11.
Some expound it of the host of heaven, and there is a great number of them;
for they that forsake the way of the Lord, they do find out many inventions, in
Gods worship. There is a double worship of God, natural, and instituted; the
one following upon the nature of God, and the other flowing from the will of
God; and the latter the Lord did see necessary in all ages, as medium cultus
naturalis, it was necessary unto Adam when he was in Paradise; the Sabbath, and
the tree of life, and the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, were then
instituted; it was so for the honor of God, that the Lord Jesus himself
observed it in the days of the flesh, and did thereby fulfill all righteousness,
and worshipped God according unto the institution of the Jewish Church, and he
has left such Institutions to be observed in his Church to the end of the
world: the Saints continued in the Apostles Dectrine and fellowship, in
breaking of bread and prayer; and now men are grown so Religious, as they cry
down instituted worship, and say that they are but forms: it is true, that
rested in they are no more, as the Ceremonies of the Jews were not: but as they
are Forms, so they are Duties; therefore to say men may use them or not use
them, and that Christians are sometimes for seeking under Forms, but there is
yet a higher way; some that are unwedded unto any Form, that reserve
themselves single for the immedi^te embraces of their love: What is this but to
forsake the Lord; because it is to forget his holy Mountain? to worship God in
any other way then he has appointed, that is Idolatry; and to neglect that way
of Worship that he has appointed his people to walk with Him in, that is
profaneness. We complain of the profaneness of the people throughout the
Nation; they are such Principles as these that are the great Grounds of
profaneness: and from hence it goes forth into all the Land; for how ready
will all they that were weary of Ordinances, and looked upon them as a burden
long ago, how greedily will they embrace such a Doctrine as this is; that may
be a bribe unto their Consciences in their profaneness, and utter neglect of
God; surely it is a good rule, qui non est Religiosus, Christianus non est:
that man does very much forfeit his Christianity, that does either in Doctrine
or Practice in this manner decry the instituted Worship of Christ: I am not
willing to speak much of Officers now, which is an Institution, as well as that
of Ordinances; for the Lord has set them in the Church, 1 Cor. 12.28. and he
has appointed their term of continuance, till we all come unto the unity of
the Faith, unto a perfect man; till the whole body of Christ be gathered, and
perfected; and the end, Ephesians. 12.14. why he has appointed them is, that we
may not be carried away with every wind of Doctrine; that was the end why God
appointed them, and this is the main reason why men oppose them; because they
cannot carry men away as they would, by this means; and theresore it is a true
observation, that never any man did begin to overthrow and corrupt Religion,
but he began with the Ministry first. It is that which Adam Contzen. directs
to the Ministers and those that give their Testimony to the Truths of God,
specially suppress them, and error cui patrocinium deerit, sine pugna concidet:
so calls he Truth; and there is a promise made to them, that God will be
present with them to the end of the world; and a provision is made for them to
the end of the world; for the Lord has ordered, that they that serve of the
Altar should live at the Altar; Cor. 1.9,14. though now a great part of the
Religion of the times is to cry down a Ministry, and so as Luther has
observed, Satan has had two ways to put out the light of the Gospel mendaciis,
and Inopia: And he says men do profess, Ministris nihil opus est: they were
things not much to be regarded, though there is a justice to be exercised unto
them as men, how much soever they are despised as Ministers: but it were not
much to be regarded, though you look upon them as men of all others the least
considerable, if God were not forsaken in it; but to forsake Gods Worship, is
in the Scriptures account to forsake God.

Thirdly, we forsake God by carnal confidence. The Lord says, Jer. 2.13. they
have forsaken me, and they have dug to themselves broken Cisterns. Jer.
17.5. Cursed is he that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and his heart
departs from the Lord: if the Lord be not exalted alone in the soul, either
sub ratione boni, aut auxilii, the heart of man forsakes him, and leans on
something else that is not God. Now if it be Counsels of men, the power of
Armies, the Assistances of Confederates, so far a man forsakes the Lord:
therefore the Lord does way lay all humane succors, that they shall prove vain
and unsuccessful; and men shall be ashamed of their Confederacies: thou shall
be ashamed of Assyria, as thou have been ashamed of Egypt thy considence; yea
destruction comes out of it; they that sit down under the shadow of a creature,
it is but under the shelter of a bramble: fire will surely come out of it to
consume the C^dars of Lebanen; when men turn to God, they are taken off from
carnal confidence, they shall then say, Ashur shall not save us: therefore men
turn to the creature when they do forsake and depart from God.

Fourthly, men forsake God in their conversation: when they neither walk with
God, or worthy of God: the ways of sin are departing from God: going into a
far Country, it is communion with Belial: and walking in ways of pride,
oppression and uncleanness, it is living without God and therefore surely it is
a forsaking of him, a departing from him; and forsaking of his Truth and
Worship; is the only and special means thereunto; our Savior says John 17.
Sanctify them by thy Truth, etc. Take away Truth, and ye destroy Holiness at
the root: Let men pretend holiness whilst they will, unclean opinions will
ever be accompanied with unclean practices; and therefore it is a vain thing
for men to hope that a holy conversation can be maintained without truth, which
is the instrument which the Lord uses of men's sanctification, Job 6.14. he
forsakes God, that forsakes the fear of the Lord.

Secondly, What is it for a people to be forsaken of God? First, when God
withdraws the influence of his Spirit from the Ordinances, that though the
Ordinances continue, yet the influences are gone; it is the first step of the
Lords removing from a people, and this is properly the removing or departing of
his glory from off the Temple; though the Lord is everywhere present, yet there
was a gracious presence there; Deus ubique est, sed non eadem ubique praestat.
And therefore there is a darkness that fills the house, when the glory of the
Lord was departed; its true, that the Temple, and the Sacrifices did continue,
but it was but barely an outside, for the presence of God in glory and mercy
was not among them; and therefore when the Lord returns to a people in mercy,
the glory of the Lord does in this manner return unto their Ordinances, Ezekiel.
43.4. while he may be found, seek the Lord; the time of the Spirits working in
the means, is the day of salvation, Heb. 6. unto that people; there is a ground
that drinks in the rain, not only of Ordinances, but of Influences: and the
Lord will say, My Spirit shall not always strive; there is an oath that may go
forth against a people, and then they are undone for ever: for the Lord is not
as a man, that he should repent: and this is the greatest Judgment that can
befall a person or a people in this life: for if the Spirit of the Lord depart
from them, and evil Spirit from God in Judgment comes upon them: a Spirit of
giddiness, a vertiginous Spirit, which does cause them to err in all the works
of their hands: there is by some a great talk of conversion, that abundance
have been lately converted: it is true, if turning unto a new opinion, or being
brought off from such a party be conversion, there are abundance of such
turnings in this Nation: but such a general conversion, that if we look into
the conversation of men, yea even of them that do profess Religion and the
power of godliness, and the good old way of holiness in the practice of it, is
even wholly forgotten amongst us.

Secondly, he takes away the Ordinances also: the presence of God is in them:
he is by these said to dwell amongst us: now when God departs from a people, he
is said to take away the Ordinances, which are the visible tokens of his
presence, Ier. 23.33. they say, the burden of the Lord: and they were weary of
the Ordinances of God amongst them, says God, this shall be your burden, I
will forsake you: Nulla posthac erit Prophetia, Calvin.
Calvin. But what if it be so? its that in a special manner that we desire: but
consider, 2 Chronicles. 7.20. I will cast this house which I have sanctified for my
name out of my sight, and I will pluck you up by the roots out of my Land which
I have given you: when God once forsakes his Ordinances, he will the Land too.

Thirdly, the Lord does forsake a people, by taking away the former assistances
that they have had, and denying of them to his people: therefore the promise is
Isa. 62.4. thou shall be no more termed forsaken: whilst they were under the
power of the enemy, and given up into the hands of their oppressors, so long
they were a people forsaken of the Lord, Josh. 1.5. I will not leave thee, nor
forsake thee: when God forsakes them, they shall not have the wonted presence
of God amongst them: the Lord will neither bless their counsels, nor go forth
with their Armies: but he will delight to make that people vile, that all their
enemies should take encouragement thereby, and say, God has forsaken them:
persecute them, and take them, for there is none to deliver them; as the
presence of God is the great terror unto all that are round about, he being a
wall of sire about them, and the glory in the middle of them; so the greatest
encouragement to the enemies, is, when they shall see that Gods people have not
the wonted presence or assistance of God with them: and they shall be a
derision to all the Nations round about: ha, ha, so would we have it.

Fourthly, God does forsake a people in respect of his returns of their
prayers, Psalm. 22.1,2. My God, why have thou forsaken me? and why art thou so
far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? O my God, I cry in the
day time, and thou hear not: and in the night season am not silent; and this
is the true greatness and the glory of a people, Deuteronomy. 4.7. that they have God
nigh them in all that they call upon him for; and this has been your glory in
former times in the sight of your adversaries: that you could say, Tertullian.
Caelum tundimus, and misericordiam extorquemus.

And the prayers of the people of God have been the fire that has gone out of
the mouths of the people of God that has consumed your enemies on every side:
as Rev. 11 5. We did no sooner make our prayers, but we might as it were, with
Stephen, lift up our eyes to heaven, and see Jesus standing at the right hand
of God: tanquam causae suae Judex and vindex: But if God forsake a people, they
may cry, but the Lord will not hear them; he will shut out their prayers in
displeasure, and will cover himself with a cloud, that they shall not pass
through: when God takes away the spirit of prayer from his people, there is not
a greater Argument that I know, that God does intend to forsake them, and to
shut out their prayers.

Use.
Having thus spoken of the Doctrinal proposition, let us take the particular
application to our selves: If you forsake him, he will also forsake you: our
own hearts cannot but testify against us, that there is a great forsaking of
God in the middle of us: look but upon the generality of the Nation, and for
all manner of profaneness we go beyond the worst of times: and under a pretense
of liberty, every man does that which is right in his own eyes; and there is no
master of restraint to put them to shame; It may be the fault is immediately to
be laid upon inferior officers, but ye know their neglects, and yet you do not
force your own Laws: misera vis est valere ad nocendum; it is woeful liberty, a
liberty of sinning, the horrible oppressions, such as have not been heard of:
you have made an act against it, and what has been done upon it? is it only to
quiet the spirts of the people? and to stop their mouths for a time only? The
oppressions amongst you are horrible: the delays of Justice, putting things
out of one hand into another: So that men know not when to have an end, that
they rather choose to sit down in despair, and loose all, then follow businesses
of the greatest concernment to them. And which of you in authority that have
abundance of outward beings, in comparison of many of your Brethren, can abate
any thing of what you can exact for any place or employment that you have,
because of the cry that is amongst us, as Nehemiah did? Nehem. 5.15. where is
Nehemiahs spirit? Former governors were chargeable to the people, and had
taken of them bread and wine, besides forty shekles of silver, etc. but so did
not I, because of the fear of God: what abatement is there of men's sallaries
and pays? they that have abundance otherwise, that formerly never had, and
could scarce ever have hoped for so much as now they have, and yet they cannot
for the necessity of their brethren abate any of it; and how strangely carnally
confident are we? and ready to sacrifice to our own nets, and to say, Our own
hand has wrought these deliverances for us: and we think we have an Army, and
a Navy, that is able to defend against all our enemies; but let me tell you, if
you live upon these, though they be as the breath of your nostrils, yet it
shall be as fire to consume you, etc. Isa. 33.11. Now as for the truths of God
and his Ordinances, how are they forsaken? all the world do witness against us
at this day: and though much has been pressed that way unto a settlement, yet
nothing is done: there are some that are enemies unto this building: all
establishment in the things of God avoided: and industriously its observed by
some (I hope it will not prove a Prophecy) that in this Age only, the
destructive work has prospered in the hand of those that sit at the stern: but
for the destructive work, let it be undertaken by whom it will, yet it has
never prospered in any hand: therefore its feared, that Gods intention in this
thing is only to destroy, and that he reserves the glory of the building unto
the generations to come: But it will be objected, is there not power enough in
Religion to avenge it self? Religio contenta est viribus suis; nec spoliata est
vi sua, etiamsi nullum habeat vindicem. 2 Cor. 10.6. our weapons are in a
readiness to avenge all disobedience; and it will be said, have not we made
Laws against them? Laws against heresy, Laws against Blasphemy? but what are
dead Laws to living examples? we are exhorted Ioh. 3. not to receive them into
our houses, and not to bid them God speed, etc. Yet you know they bring not
this Doctrine: and yet who are the men of your counsels? who are admitted to
your houses? received at your tables as your chiefest friends but such men? and
those that you know to be such men, that oppose and are professed enemies to
the truths of God, in such things that you your selves know to be truths: And
will that maxim of Mariana bear you out? Princeps nil statuat de Religione:
its true, Conscience will seek a bribe, if the mind be upon any thing, it will
color it over with fair pretenses: but it is but a fig-leafe, and will appear
so before God: surely you should walk in the ways of Godly Magistrates who
have gone before you. Now to which of the Saints will you turn? When did ever
any good Magistrate plead, that in the things of God, as a Magistrate, he was
not concerned?

But it will be said; All this is but begging the Question. For this supposes
that the Magistrate is concerned in matters of Religion, which is the thing in
doubt: I look not on it as seasonable to dispute the thing now; only crave
leave to offer a sew considerations to you about it.

First, that which may provoke God to forsake a Nation, that certainly
Magistrates are concerned in: But the things of Religion are the great things
that provoke God to forsake a Nation, in Ezekiel. 8.5. the Prophet says, they
have set up an Image of jealousy to provoke me to depart from my sanctuary:
And the next news you hear is, God departs from the City.

Secondly, that which lays the foundation for the overthrow of Governors and
Government, that Magistrates are concerned in; but corruption in Religion does
so: take but the example of a heathen, in Ezr. 7.23. Whatsoever is commanded by
the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of
heaven; for why should there be wrath upon the Realm of the King and his son?
Nay consider but one man, its a strange instance that Lachish should be called
the Beginning of sin, in Mich. 1.13. Why, Lachish the Kenite carried away
Michals Gods; they conquered Lachish, and set up the Idols there: this began in
one man, and never ceased till it had destroyed the whole Nation, brought the
Captivity at last.

Nay I should desire to add one thing more; the neglects in this kind has
brought the greatest Judgments upon the Church and people of God in the world:
two or three instances I shall give: What brought the Goths and Vandals upon
the Western Empire? the neglect of the Arrian Heresy. Because the woman was
not relieved, the Lord brought in those barbarous Nations for her succor: What
brought in the Saracens upon the Eastern part of the Empire? why corruption in
Religion: they worshipped Images, and they repented not; What brought in
Antichrist, the temple of God becoming an outer Court? there was a general
neglect of the things of God: and by this means Antichrist arose: And Austin
says, this year Austin.
Libertatem perditionis promisit. Julian did suffer all men to use their own
Religion with freedom: leaving every one freely to destroy themselves: Let
these things be considered, and I doubt not but it will appear that Magistrates
are somewhat concerned in the things of God: if you were pressed to any thing
that did not savor of truth, or were any way unsuitable to the Gospel, happily
somewhat might be said: But that which has been pressed upon you, is only this:
Give testimony for those truths that you your selves profess, and
discountenance the contrary errors: And I am sure they that are most tender in
these things and speak least in it, say, Igne charitatis haeretici sunt
comburendi, we must burn the heretic with the fire of Charity: Love the man,
but hate the error: but not to countenance the error by countenancing the man.

I should now press you to consider the misery that will come upon you by Gods
forsaking us. I will only now speak briefly to three things concerning it.

First, if God forsake us, all the creatures will forsake us: as when God
became an enemy at first to mankind, all the creatures also did become their
enemy: it were no matter for the desertion of all the neighboring Nations,
though we were as a speckled Bird unto them and they all hate us: yet, if God
be with us, who can be against us? but, Toll Deum and nullus ero; if the glory
of the Lord departed, then the Cherubims lifted up their wings, and are gone:
as the voice that was heard to say in the Temple the night before Jerusalem was
taken, Migremus hinc, etc.

Secondly; if God forsake us, all the creatures will break in upon us: God has
forsaken him, pursue him and take him: for his hedge, his fence is taken away:
I will take away the hedge thereof, shall the Lord say, and then a poor
creature may comfort himself as Saul did in the creatures, honor me before the
people, when the Lord had rejected him; but it is but cold comfort for a man so
to do; for thy own servants will then become thy enemies.

Thirdly, there is no one thing that afflicts and affects a gracious heart more
then desertions; either in Church or state, or his own soul, he fears nothing
else; all that David still prays for, is O Lord, forsake me not: Oh forsake me
not utterly; Lord be not thou far from me: there is this difference commonly
between a godly man and a wicked man: the one fears Gods punishments: but the
other fears Gods departure: and therefore Austin, It is as with a chaste wife
and a harlot: Austin.
they both fear their husbands; Haec ne veniat; illa ne decedat: And the reason
is, because the one seeks only blessings from God; and the other only seeks
communion with God; and if he had never so much from God, yetif he be denied to
seek his face denied fellowship with him, and if the Lord do so forsake him,
all things are bitter unto him, because the joy of his heart is gone; surely,
if you go on to forsake the Lord, he will forsake you; but the desertion begins
on your part; if you do not forsake him, he will not forsake you; therefore so
far as you have backslided from God, return to him, and you have this promise,
I will heal your backslidings.

THE DOCTRINE Of the Jews Vocation.
Preached at Gregory's Lecture.
ROMANS 11.26. And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written, etc.


THe Apostle having spoken in the close of the former Chapter of the vocation of
the Gentiles, I was found of them that sought me not; and of the rebellious,
under which is employed the rejection of the Jews, all the day long have I
stretched out my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people: he closes the
Discourse in this Chapter, and makes of this Chapter three parts; first,
Consolatoria; he has not cast off his people, (...), e conspectu amovere: he
has cast them off, but not so as he will never look after them again; he has
not so cast them off: for there is even amongst them, and to come out of their
loins, who are at present rejected, a seed according to the election of grace,
though those four great Judgments threatened are come upon them: there is
poured upon them the Spirit of a deep sleep unto this day: their table is made
a snare: and their eyes are darkened that they see not: and they do always bow
down their backs; but these Judgments shall not always lie upon them, because
they are dear unto God, according to the election of grace: the Lord has not
cast off his people whom he knew before.

Secondly, Hortatoria: If the Jews were broken off, that were the natural
branches, yet let not the Gentiles boast against the branches broken off: be
not highminded but fear: for if God spared not the natural branches, take heed
lest he spare not thee also: behold therefore the goodness, and severity of
God; toward thee goodness, if thou continue in his goodness; if not, thou
shall also be cut off.

Thirdly, Prophetica: and that is of the grafting in of the Jews again, the
natural branches, if they continue not in their unbelief of what the state of
the Jews should be when the Lord again shall return to them in mercy, and build
up the Tabernacle of David that is fallen down: and this he does Usher in with
a praemium, as being a great truth, and that which he would have specially
observed, I would not have you ignorant of this mystery: What is a mystery? a
mystery is something made known by Revelation, and can be known no other way:
it is from the word (...), Phil. 4.12. I am instructed from heaven: a truth
which the Apostle had been taught by divine Revelation: and though much of this
is spoken of and foretold in the Scripture, yet there is a spirit of Revelation
that must go to the opening thereof, or else he could never have understood it
himself, nor been able to reveal it or discover it to others: its true, it was
abundantly revealed in the Scriptures: and when it was discovered to the
Apostles, they could see clear Scripture for it, but not till then: they are
mysteries till the Lord please to enlighten the understanding to know these
mysteries: and therefore as the calling of the Gentiles is said to be a
mystery hid in God from Ages and from Generations, and made known only by
Revelation, Ephesians. 3.4,5,6. sc. that the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs with the
same body, and partakers of the Promise of Christ by the Gospel; the calling of
the Gentiles, though abundantly foretold in the Scripture, was a mystery unto
the Jews, that they understood it not; and so the calling of the Jews may seem
also a mystery unto the Gentiles, till the Lord reveal it unto them; (...),
Chrysostom so calls the Doctrine of the Jews calling, Chrysostom
a paradox, and strange thing; A strange and a wonderful thing, and he that
does publish it, shall seem at first to preach a paradox and a new Doctrine:
But what is this mystery? Blindness in spirit is happened unto Israel, until the
fullness of the Gentiles shall come in: that is the mystery: Blindness is in
part come upon them, (...). There are three Interpretations, and all true.
First, non omnibus, it is not come upon all Israel, but upon a part; and so it
is to speak as the Apostles manner is, molli locutione, though it came upon a
great part of them, and in comparison, there were but a few converted unto the
faith of Christ, yet he says it came not upon all, but upon part of them only,
the whole Nation were not cast away, (...), Chrysostom. there are many of them
now do believe, and many of them hereafter shall believe: and therefore it is
not come upon all the Jews, for God had mercy on many in those primitive times;
Insomuch that the first glorious Christian Church, was a Jewish Church:
Blindness is therefore but in part. Secondly, non omnino: it is not a blindness
in all things, but in respect of this one particular, to see Jesus Christ to be
the Messiah, and the Savior of the world, the consolation of I srael which
they expected and waited for; in this respect they were under a judicial
blindness: they that were otherwise, Ieshuron, the seeing people, and they that
had lived in the valley of Vision, and knew more of the mind of God then all
the Nations of the earth besides, for in Judah is God known and his name is
great in Israel, etc. so that there is a particular blindness in Judgment;
that as God may and does hide some objects from a people, as he did Lots door
from the Sodomites, and so the Disciples that conferred with Christ, their eyes
were held that they might not know him; so the Lord does in Judgment hide some
Truths and some Doctrines from men, that they shall not see them; 2 Cor. 3.15.
to this day when Moses is read, there is a vail upon their hearts, that is, in
reference unto Christ, and the things of Christ, which are foretold and spoken
of in the Old Testament; but when they shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall
be taken away, etc. and so, though they know much of the Law and the mind of
God, in respect of moral duties, and the worship of the Lord required of them,
yet the intent of these, either as Christ was hid in the one, or as the other
was a Schoolmaster to bring unto Christ, so they had a blindness upon their
hearts: a blindness so in part was come upon them in respect of the object:
thus we may often note; men may be knowing in some things, and yet have on them
particular blindness in others. Thirdly, in respect of the time, it shall be
but in part, not a continual, or everlasting blindness; though it has been a
long and dreadful desertion as ever came upon any people, never was any the
like, therefore the Apostle says, wrath is come upon them ^wordE the
uttermost, 1 These. 2.^6. (...) which may be either understood of those
particular persons, as Beza says, who did oppose the present ministry, and
so wra^ might come upon them for ever to eternity: an everlasting destruction,
referred unto the particular persons who did maliciously oppose the preaching of
the Gospel; or else it may be understood de atrocitate paenae; and so the word
is used, 1 Pet. 1.13. Hope to the end, or hope perfectly; but the end is
commonly put for the finishing of any particular dispensation; so the end of
judgment upon the Jews, Dan. 9.24,26. and Luke 21.9. the end is not by and by;
and so the end of any Judgment or dispensation; the end of the administration
of the Kingdom of Christ: 1 Cor. 15.24. then comes the end; Dan 12.9. Seal the
Book till the time of the end; till the time that God has appointed for the
calling of the Jews, and the fulfilling of this mystery, 1 Pet. 4.7. the end
of all things is at hand; the total desolation of the Jewish state and worship,
not of the end of the world is it spoken; So 1 John 2.18. This is the last
time; we read, This is the last hour; of what? of the world? no, but of this
dispensation to the Jewish state, before their utter ruin; So, wrath is come
upon them to the end; till the time that the Lord has appointed when they
shall be called, and then the Lord will cause his fury to depart from them; and
that shall be, when the fullness of the Gentiles shall come in, then the wrath
upon the Jews shall end, and continue no longer; but when the fullness of the
Gentiles is come in, then shall the blindness of the Jews be taken off: and
they shall be again ingrafted into their own Olive Tree, that is, they that
were called Loammi, and were not a Church unto God, but were cast off and
termed desolate and forsaken, they shall become a Church unto God again, and so
all Israel shall be saved. By all Israel, there is a double sense of it.

First, some refer it only to the Jews, and so all Israel, is as much as tota
gens Israelitica, that whereas before, even in the time they were broken off,
and the Gentiles grafted in, and surrogated in their place, there were many
particular persons converted of the Jews, and they were brought home unto
Christ, and added unto the true Church of Christ, but yet the Nation still
remained under blindness, as rejected by Christ still; but now, that mercy
which was before showed unto particular persons, shall now become National, and
it shall take in the body of the Jewish Nation, which is yet preserved in their
dispersions in great multitudes, unto this great day of Jesreel; So Beza. Par.
etc.
and they say, Else the Apostle had revealed no such great mystery, to say,
that when as blindness was removed from the Jews, then the fullness of the
Gentiles that come in to the faith, shall be saved, and a great number of the
Jews; for it was plain that the Gentiles were converted and brought home
daily; but the subject the Apostle had in the words, is to speak of the coming
in of the Jews which should be as a new resurrection, and therefore they
understood it not of spiritual Israel, but of Israel according to the flesh;
others do understand it of the whole Israel of God, that is, of the whole
Church of God; which shall be made up of Jews and Gentiles, when it shall be
presented by Christ unto the Father, without spot or wrincle, etc. And it is a
speech like unto that John 10. Other sheep I have which are not of this fold,
them I must bring in, and these shall be one fold, and have one shepherd. What
is there spoken of the conversion of the Gentiles, is here spoken of the
conversion of the Jews, etc. and yet there is a mystery revealed in it also,
not to say that the Gentiles converted shall be saved, that was a thing
commonly known, but that at the coming in of the Jews, there shall be a
greater fulness of the Gentiles brought in, and that the Gentile Church shall
be great gains by the Jewish convertion; that as their casting off was the
enriching of the world, so their coming in should be life from the dead; and
that there should be a great addition to the coming in of the Gentiles, and a
second fullness of them brought in at the conversion of the Jews and so all
Israel shall be saved, not only natural Israel, and those that were surrogated
and ingraffed into their Room, but also those that are supperaded unto both
these; For as is said, Esa. 60 3.
the Gentiles shall come unto thy light, and Kings to the brightness of thy
rising. I will send those that escape of them unto the Nations unto Ta^shish,
Pull, and Lud to Tubal, and Javan, to the Isles a far off, that have not heard
my fame, nor seen my glory, and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles,
Esa. 66.19. So that when the fulness of the Gentiles that God had appointed
before their call shall come in; then blindness shall be take off from Israel,
and they shall be converted to the Lord in a great multitude, A national way,
that they shall become a Church unto Christ, being ingraffed into their own
Olive tree; and then shall there come in a greater fullness of the Gentiles,
even of many that never heard of the name of the Lord, and so all Israel shall
be saved; but indeed the ensuing promise does seem to restrain it only into
natural Israel; For it is a Redeemer shall come to Sion, and he that turns
away the iniquity from Jacob, Esa. 59.20. And this is the Covenant that I will
make with them, when I shall pardon their sins; and so it refers all unto
Israel, that is, unto the Jews; and all Israel is meant not a sprinkling, and
some few first fruits but the whole crop; and whereas before he had said that
blindness came but in part upon them, (...), Now he says when their
deliverance shall come, it shall come unto all Israel, even unto the whole
Nation, for their iniquities shall be turned away by God, and they also shall
turn from their iniquities: All Israel shall be saved: not every particular
person, but a National conversion. All Israel, etc.

Being to treat of the coming in of the Jews, when all Israel shall be
brought in; there are many heads unto which all may be reduced, which orderly
the Scripture speaks there, which I shall briefly in a sum (...), set before
you at this time; that I may be at least an occasion of enquiry into each of
them, and thereby happily light may be increased.

First, there shall be National conversion of the Jews, wherein a great, if
not the greatest part of the Nation of the Jews that are reserved, shall be
turned unto the Lord. This some oppose, a Conversion they grant, but a National
Conversion it must not be.

Secondly, this Conversion shall be in the height of their misery, when there
shall be the greatest misery and affliction upon them, that ever was since their
dispersion; There shall be a time of trouble, such as there never was since
they were a Nation unto the same time; and at that time, Daniels people shall
be delivered, as many as are found written in the book, Dan. 12.1. when they
shall be dry bones, and all hope shall be past with them, that they shall say,
our bones are dry bones, our hope is past, and we are cut off for our part;
then the dry bones shall live, and they that sleep in the dust shall awake,
Ezekiel. 37.11.12. Behold, Oh my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to
come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. That Is the
Lords time of love above all other times, when men lie wallowing in their
blood; when their hopes shall be lowest, their Redemption shall be near.

Thirdly, when they are converted, they shall return unto Christ, and embrace
him whom they formerly crucified and rejected, saying, we will not have this
man to rule over us, and his blood be upon us and our Children; but there shall
come a time, when Israel and Judah shall be gathered together, (which never yet
was since their rejection) and they shall appoint to themselves one head, Hos.
1.11. and this head can be no other then Christ, whom they shall then by their
own election appoint to be as a Head or a King over them: its true that he was
appointed by the Father in his eternal decree, and in the covenant made between
the Father and the Son before the World was, as he himself says, I was set up
from everlasting: it cannot be spoken of him as he is God, for it is (...) I
was appointed, Prove 8.2.3.
whch must refer into the office into which he was designed from eternity by
the Father, it is the same word used Ps. 26. I have set my King upon my holy
hill of Sion; but now their hearts shall be brought about, and they that
rejected the counsel of God against themselves, and would not have him to be
their head, whom the Lord had appointed; now they shall also choose the same,
and consent unto him; they shall appoint unto themselves o^e head, etc. In that
day shall there be a Fountain open unto the house of David, and the inhabitants
of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness, Zach. 13.1. it is spoken of the day
of their conversion, as appears by what goes before in the former Chapter;
then shall Christ become the glory of his people Israel; he was their glory,
because that of them, according to the flesh Christ came, Romans 9. But now they
shall choose him as their glory, and they shall rejoice and glory in him, and
they shall in their return seek the Lord and David their King, Hos. 3.5. that
is, they shall seek God aright, according to the way of the Gospel, and with
Gospel apprehensions, they shall not only seek the Lord from whom they have
grievously revolted; but they shall seek him in Christ, and they shall come to
him in the way that he has appointed; that is, in Christ, and unto Christ
shall they come.

Fourthly, at their conversion, there shall be wrought in them a great and a
national humiliation Jer. 31.18.19. I was ashamed and confounded because I did
bear the reproach of my youth, Hos. 14.8. Ephraim shall say, What have I do
any more with Idols? I have heard him and observed him, etc. Zach. 12.10. I
will pour upon the house of David, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit
of Grace and supplication, and they shall look upon him whom they have pierced;
and they shall mourn for him, and be in bitterness for him, as for an only son,
as he that mourns for his first b^rn: There shall be a great mourning, as the
mourning of Hadadrimmon, etc. Jer. 31.8,9. Behold I will bring them from the
North country, and will gather them from the ends of the Earth, and they shall
come with weeping, and with supplication: I will lead them to Sion, they shall
come, but with weeping and supplications, etc. But is not this spoken of their
return from Babylon? How can it? did they come out of Captivity weeping? It
cannot be meant fully of that return, though there are different degrees of the
accomplishment of prophesies; but if we look to verse 1. At the same time,
says the Lord, I will be the God of all the Tribes of Israel; and they shall be
my people; Which can hardly be imagined unto the ten Tribes, in that return to
be fulfilled; for they did never return from the land of their Captivity unto
this day. There were but two Tribes returned from Babylon, we never read of the
return of the ten Tribes. They went into Captivity with weeping, and with
weeping shall they return. But if so it shall be sorrow under suffering in the
one, and under the sight and apprehension of their sin in the other.

Fifthly, the Scripture seems to speak, as if the great means of their
Conversion, should not be by the preaching of the Gospel, as the Gentile
Churches are brought home unto the Lord, but that it shall be by sight, and by
a visible appearance of the Lord Jesus unto them. I shall assert nothing
possitively in it, only give me leave to set before you some Scriptures that
seem fully to speak so much, Zach. 12.10. They shall look upon him whom they
have pierced, and mourn. And that it is not barely a spiritual looking upon him
with an eye of faith, such as the holy Ghost calls, Joh. 6.40. Seeing the Son,
and believing on him, but that it is a bodily vision, and to see him with
bodily eyes; for Dan. 7.13. there is the Son of man coming in the clouds of
heaven brought to the ancient of days, to receive a Kingdom. What Kingdom;
sure his Davidical Kingdom, when he shall sit on the throne of his Father
David. When Christ receives this Kingdom, it is not as he receives the
spiritual Kingdom, and entered upon the administration of the providential
Kingdom that was by his sitting down at the right hand of his Father, and so
enter as man actually, upon the administration of all things: for its plain,
that to receive this Kingdom which shall be after the four beasts are
destroyed, He shall come in the Clouds of Heaven, and they shall bring him unto
the ancient of days: he comes attended with the Angels, and they bring him
unto the ancient of days; its true, that Gods coming in the Clouds, his riding
upon the Clouds; its that which notes out the eminent, visible, glorious
appearance, of his Majesty: but its the appearance here of Christ, as he is the
Son of man, which I conceive is never found to be so used in the Scripture, but
at the last day, the Lord Jesus shall appear in the clouds when he comes to
judgment. As spoken of a visible appearance; so this also shall be, and so
much happily is meant, Mat. 4.30.31. Then shall appear the sigh of the Son of man
in Heaven, and then shall ye see the Son of man coming in the clouds of
Heaven: I know its a perplexing Scripture, yet happily is meant this appearance
of the Son of man, not to judgment, but as a sign that the judgment is near:
that which they may be as truly assured of, as the husbandman can be, that the
summer is near, when he sees the figtree put forth leaves, etc. and therefore I
should rather conceive there is meant the appearance of Christ in the clouds
for the conversion of the Jews, and to receive a Kingdom, rather then his
appearance at the day of judgment, when he must shortly give up the Kingdom;
and I am induced rather to think so, because it follows, and he will send the
Angels with a great sound of a Trumpet, and they shall gather together the
elect from the four winds. Which is, I do not conceive to be restreined unto
the day of judgment, though the Apostle does so speak also of the general
Resurrection, 1 Cor. 15.52. The Trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be
raised, the Lord shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
Archangel, and the trumpet of God, 1 These. 4.16. But when this Trumpet shall
sound, all the Nations shall be raised, bad as well as good, Elect as well as
Reprobate, and they shall all awake unto judgment; but this is a Trumpet, that
gathers only the Elect from the four winds: therefore it seems that none
shall hear this trumpet but the Elect; and that it shall sound unto them as
such, and shall never reach unto the Reprobate, and that instruments of mercy
or judgment are called Angels is ordinary, and that what the Lord does
eminently, and publicly and dreadfully make known his glory to them, with the
sound of a Trumpet, is clear, Rev. 1.10. and 4.1. and therefore it may be
spoken of the Lords gathering in the Elect of the Jews, having not cast off
whom he knew before, who are now scattered, even into the four winds of
Heaven: and therefore there is that which seems to incline unto this, of the
conversion of the Jews at first, shall be by sight and by appearance of the
Lord Jesus Christ visibly in the clouds of Heaven, and so Paul's conversion
should be as the first fruits, the Lord setting forth him as a pattern to the
whole Nation; his conversion was by a sight of Christ from Heaven: and a
glorious light that shone round about him: and so its probable there shall also
be, but yet not all of them so converted, but the Lord will take some of them,
and make them to be as Priests unto the Lord, and they shall declare his glory
amongst the Gentiles, and shall be instrumental in gathering of them, and they
shall also bring in their brethren, (that is) say some, the unconverted
Gentiles, which shall be as brethren, then all the differences between them,
being taken away. Others more properly refer it unto the Jews, the remainder
of them not brought in the first grand conversion of the Nation: for it is
said, They shall bring all their brethren for an offering unto the Lord out of
all Nations, upon Horses and Charriots, and upon wild beasts unto my holy
mountain; So that it may be some of them shall be converted by the appearance
of Christ, and others of them by the preaching of the Gospel, by those that are
amongst them converted: that their brethren going forth to them, and declaring
to them the returning of God in ways of grace unto their Nation, and the great
things that he has done for them, and so they having a spirit of grace poured
out upon them, shall also be brought as an offering to the Lord.

Sixthly, The manner of their calling shall be exceeding eminent and glorious,
unto the admiration of all Nations, that they shall all see how the Lord has
honored them, Esa. 60.1. The glory of the Lord is risen upon them, Hos. 1.11.
Great shall be the day of Jisreel, it shall be a glorious day, that which shall
make them honorable in the eyes of all the Nations of the Earth: that ten men
out of every Nation under Heaven shall lay hold of the scirt of a Jew, and
shall say, we will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you. Ps.
10.2.16. When the Lord shall build up Sion, he will appear in Glory; they shall
have glorious appearances of him, such as no people ever had, and this shall
make them to be the desire of all people, as they have had a great day of
misery, so a great and glorious day of their deliverance shall come, to the
astonishment and amazement of the Nations: and there are many great reasons
that it must be a great day; but I cannot insist upon them.

Seventhly, the time of their calling shall be when the fullness of the Gentiles
is come in, blindness so long is happened unto them: when the four Monarchs are
cast down to dust in the period of them, Dan. 7.12.13.14. after the destruction
of Antichrist, when the little horn is slain, and his body given unto the
burning flame; now he comes to receive a Kingdom of the ancient of days; and it
shall be when the seventh Angels Trumpet shall sound, then the Kingdoms and
Nations under the whole Earth, become the Kingdoms of the Lord and his Christ,
Rev. 11.16. which is from the setting up, the abomination of desolation, the
1290. days, which shall be the year of the Jews redemption, Dan. 12.11. which is
to be finished four thousand year after which is 1335. days, but these are
times that I cannot now speak to.

Eighthly, then shall be amongst them a glorious Church, in which the presence
of the Lord shall dwell, Ezekiel. 37.27. I will set my Tabernacle among them for
ever more. And elsewhere, Ezekiel. 48. ult
the name of the City shall be, Jehovah shammah, the Lord is there. Rev. 21.3.
The Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them; and it is not
in Heaven, for it is new Jerusalem that comes down from God out of Heaven: and
the Kings of the earth shall bring their glory to it, and the glory of the Lord
and of the Lamb shall be (...) the light of it, and Rev. 21.12.
twelve Angels at the gates: and there shall be no use of the service of the
Angels in Heaven, they are sent forth as ministering spirits for the good of the
Elect. But when they are gathered in, as their Kindom begins with the Kingdom
of Christ, so shall it end also; for he will put down all rule, authority and
power: it is to be understood, Etiam de principatu Angelico, as well as of any
other. And they shall have the purest Ordinances, Rivers of water of Life, that
is clear as Crystal, not running blood, not mixed with fire, Rev. 22.1. Not
blood, as is the Doctrine of Antichrist: nor mixed with Fire, either of
affliction or contention, as are the doctrines of the reformed Churches, and
then shall be the exactest discipline, all that love and make a lie shall be
without: and the more of Gods order, the more of his presence, and his
blessing: for they shall see his face, and his name shall be written upon
their foreheads, etc.

Ninthly, this Church of the converted Jews shall be the Mother Church, and
shall be exalted above all the Gentile Churches; the mountain of the Lords
house exalted above the tops of the mountains, Ezekiel. 16.61. then shall thou be
ashamed when I shall give thee thy sisters for daughters: all the Gentile
Churches shall know that they do receive, as the Law from them at the first, so
now abundance of light and nourishment; great discoveries, of God and of his
grace; for the light of the Moon shall be as that of the Sun, and the light of
the Sun sevenfold: and the Temple shall be opened in Heaven, and you may see
into the Ark of the Testament: all vailes shall be taken away, both from the
hearts of men, and the mysteries of God and the Abdita, the hidden things of
God revealed, the which should then be made fully manifest. For he did not
write the Word for the World to come, but for the Life that now is: and
therefore there is nothing there hid, that shall not be made manifest; it shall
appear unto the world, that he wrote none of those divine mysteries in the word
in vain.

Tenthly, Then shall follow great peace and prosperity in the world; all
persecutions, either from Enemies without, or Tyrants within, shall come to an
end, Ezekiel. 34.25.26. I will make with them a Covenant of peace, and will cause
evil beasts to cease out of the Land, they shall dwell safely in the wilderness
and sleep in the woods, Esa. 66.12. I will extend peace to her like a River
that shall never be dried up: that when the enemies shall look when it will be
dry, it may be expected in vain, Labitur and labetur: Zach. 14.11.
Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited, persecutions from without for the four
Monarchs shall be destroyed, and Satan shall be bound, that he shall not stir
them up to make war against the Saints, Rev. 20. Ezekiel. 45.8.
because their Princes before did slay them, and not hold themselves guilty,
make nothing of oppression, but now he says, my Princes shall oppress my
people no more: a wall 12000 furlongs high, Rev. 21.16. and for prosperity,
Esa. 60.16.17. etc, she shall suck the milk of the Gentiles, and the breasts of
Kings.

Eleventhly, Over this people Jesus Christ shall in a glorious manner reign,
and that in a more eminent manner then he has done over the Churches of the
Gentiles; for it is the Kingdom of David his Father which he is to sit on, a
Kingdom which he is yet to receive, Ezekiel. 34.23.24. ^zek. 37.25 Ezekiel. 21.26
David my servant he shall feed them, and rule over them: I will be their God,
and David my servant as a Prince amongst them: when the dry bones are risen,
David my servant shall be their Prince for ever, remove the Diadem, etc, he
will overturn, overturn, overturne, and then will he come whose right it is.
The Scepter shall depart from Judah, and they shall be many days without a King:
Any form of government of their own, Hos. 34. and what then? they shall seek
the Lord, and David their King. unto whom the Father has committed all
judgment, Joh. 5.22. and in a special manner the Kingdoms and Nations over
this people, that from his presence their judgment is to go forth, and
therefore he shall in a more special manner be be King of the Jews, as being
his own people, unto whom he has a right of inheritance, more then he has over
any people of the world besides, and yet I do confess, I do not see light from
the Scripture to assert the personal reign of Christ upon Earth over them, and
the Saints reigning with him in his person; I know Aliud est Christu^ regnare
in Sanctis; Aliud Sanctos regnare cum Christo: both shall be in this life in
some sense; but yet whether Christ shall rule them by a personal residence upon
earth, is unto me still a doubt; but this I say, the Lord Jesus Christ has a
peculiar right unto the Kingdom of the Jews, as he is of the seed of David: And
God will give him the Throne of his father David.

Twelfthly, The people shall be exceeding holy in this Church, walking in truth
and sincerity; there is a form of Godliness, but there is little of the power
now, there shall be much of the power of Godliness, of the life of Christ
manifested in them; thy people shall be all righteous, the branch of my
planting that I may be glorified, Esaias 60.21. It is the Bride, the Lambs wife
having the glory of the Lord upon her, Rev. 21.10,11. its true there shall not
be perfect holiness in the Saints, for there is a Tree of life for medicine as
well as for meat, Rev. 22.2. and they shall not be without Hypocrites, those
that shall cleave unto them by flattery, but yet there shall be a glorious
spirit of discerning even of them also, and they shall be without, not only
that make, but they that do love a lie.

Thirteenthly, This Church shall have abundance of converts, and their
Ordinances shall be exceeding fruitful, to bring in souls into the Lord, Ezekiel.
37.9,10,11. Where the Waters come, every thing shall live, and there shall be a
multitude of fish, even as that of the great Sea exceeding many, thy Gates
shall be open continually not shut day nor night, that they may bring the
riches of the Gentiles and their Kings shall be brought, and they shall fly as
a Cloud, and as Doves unto their Windows, because of the glorious Majesty of
the Lord that is seen amongst them, etc.

Fourteenthly, They shall be brought home into their own land, and they shall
dwell there, they shall dwell in their own City as in the days of old, and
Ezekiel. 12. Ezekiel. 37.25.
Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place even in Jerusalem: they
shall dwell in the land that I gave to Jacob their father, wherein their
fathers dwelt, they shall dwell there even they and their Children, and
Childrens Children for ever.

Fifteenthly, There shall be a perfect union between the ten Tribes, and the
two Tribes, and the hatred shall depart, that breach was never yet made up, But
then the sticks shall become one, Ezekiel. 37.19. The envy of Judah shall depart,
and Ephraim shall vex Judah no more: I will gather them out of all Countries,
whither I have driven them in my anger, and I will give them one heart, and one
way, and then Jehovah shall be one, and his name one, etc. Jer. 32.39.


Sixteenthly, They shall be the great instrument in the hand of the Lord, for
to ruin and destroy the Turkish Empire, when the Lord shall bend Judah for
him, and fill his bow with Ephraim, Dan. 11.40.44. We read of the King of the
South, whom tidings out of the North, and out of the East shall trouble. There
are several reasons, why by the King of the South, I conceive to be meant the
Turkish Empire, as that which had the next power, and exercised the next
Tyranny over the Jews; and being come to a height, there is tidings from the
East and North, troubling the gathering together of the Jews, Ezekiel. 37.7. when
the bones came together, there was a great noise, and a shaking, and standing
up, they became an exceeding great and formidable Army; and he says, that
these bones are the house of Israel returning into their own land; here is the
tidings that trouble the King of the South; there the Turk invadeth the
glorious holy Mountain, and then he comes to an end, and none shall help him:
it is Euphrates must be dried up to prepare the way for the Kings of the East,
Rev. 16.12. that they may join themselves with the Western Christians.

Seventeenthly, At their returning to the Lord, there shall be by them a
wonderful blessing upon all the Gentile Churches, their gain shall be much by
it, they were gainers by the Jews rejection, their casting off was the
enriching of the World, their diminishing the riches of the Gentiles, how much
more their fullness, Romans 11.12.15. it shall be as life from the dead, it is
not I conceive spoken of the Jews, that there coming in should be suddenly and
by an act of almighty power as a resurrection, as it is resembled, Ezekiel. 37.
but it shall be unto the Gentiles, as life from the dead; that is, as misery is
expressed by death, so all joy and happiness is expressed by life, it shall be as
it were a resurrection, put a new face upon the world, that as it shall be a
glorious condition upon earth, when all the Saints shall arise and stand upon
the earth with joy, being perfected in their graces, and in their faculties, so
shall this be even unto the Gentiles, as well as unto the Jews, a resurrection.

Eighteenthly, With the calling of the Jews, the Kingdom of the God of heaven
shall be set up; that which is now so commonly called the fifth Monarchy, shall
begin when the four Monarchies are destroyed, which shall be with the drying up
the River Euphrates, that is, the Turkish Empire: Its true that Christ has a
Kingdom, during the rule of the Monarchies, in the days of those Kings God
does set up a Kingdom, but it is a little stone and it breaks the Image by
degrees, and then afterward becomes a Mountain, and the Kingdom given unto the
Saints of the most high: Which in the Book of Dan. 7.27. its meant the Jews.
who are every where called the holy people, not of the Gentile Saints, Dan.
8.24. and 12.7. and therefore it is they must take the Kingdom and possess it,
and it shall be given to them, which is not well applied by all that will call
themselves Saints and holy people, as if they were to take to themselves the
rule of all the Kingdoms of the world.

Nineteenthly, Unto this time the perfect fulfilling of all the prophecy of
God does belong: there are degrees of fulfilling the prophecies more or less
in all times; but its unto this that the perfections of the World are reserved,
Rev. 10.7. its never before the 7th Trumpet sound, that the mystery of God is
finished; that is, all those secrets that were in the bosom of God to perform,
and which he revealed unto his servants the Prophets, all those do not receive
their full accomplishment; all that God does intend to do for his people in the
advancement of his son in this World, is now fulfilled and accomplished.

Lastly, And this glorious condition shall continue unto this people unto the
day of judgment; that they shall suffer no more, the Sun shall no more go
down, nor the Moon withdraw it self: Esaias 60.20. I will set my Tabernacle in
the middle of them for evermore, Ezekiel. 37.26. by an everlasting covenant, and I
will plant them in their own land with my whole heart, and my whole soul: and I
will never turn away from them to do them good; there shall be no more sorrow,
nor crying, all tears from their eyes shall be wiped away, and no more curse as
they formerly had, Rev. 22.4. they shall be cast out of the land no more, etc.
There Sun did rise and set, but now shall go down no more: These things require
further discussing then one hour permits: But having laid down these things in
the general, I hope it will engage others to look further into them.

The first by way of Doctrine on this time, There shall be a great and a national
conversion of the Jews unto the Lord; not here and there a man, but even
multitudes of them, a whole Nation, all Israel, the whole house of Israel shall
live, they that went before, were but as the first fruits, Romans 11.16. if the
first fruit be holy, so is the lump, the harvest, therefore all that have been
converted is but as the first fruits, in comparison of the lump, the harvest of
that people are yet to come into God, Is. 66.8. the Earth brings forth in a
day, and a Nation born at once, Esaias, 49.21. I was desolate and left alone, who
has begotten me all these, where have they been? etc. And the grounds are;
First, they do many of them belong to the election of grace, God will not cast
off his People whom he knew before; and though we can see none, yet the Lord
looks not as men look, he has 7000 in Israel, etc. when a man cannot see one,
and the Elect shall attain mercy, for electing love will follow a man til it
overcome him, and prevail with him, and will overcome.

2dly. Austrium Predestinatio electos ad gloriam usque producit.
By reason of the covenant made with their fathers, they are beloved for their
fathers sake; its true God does take children into their Parents covenant, but
they first in the outward privileges of the covenant, then God breaks them off
from this also, but the Lord has a time when the covenant shall take place
again, and it is by virtue of this covenant that they do attain mercy; the Lord
remembering the covenant made with Abraham and with his seed; and therefore he
will not cast away the whole society in the latter days, he will return unto
them again, and a redeemer shall come unto them there is a seed of election runs
through their fathers loins, and when this seed is brought forth, then for
their fathers sake they shall be called.

Use.
Such a conversion we should help forward by faith and prayer, and so much the
rather, because the time approaches, the promises are even come unto the birth,
and they do draw on apace: Consider these six things, first how sweet will the
presence of God then be: 2. The Sun shall be ashamed and the Moon confounded,
when the Lord shall reign in Mount Sion, and in Jerusalem and before his
ancients gloriously, Esaias 24. last. Then shall it be said, the Tabernacle of God
is with men. 2dly How glorious will it be to see abundance of Souls converted
every one bearing twins, and not one barren amongst them, Rev. 15.8. No man was
able to, enter into the Temple during the time of the Vials, now the smoke
being gene many enter in. 3dly To see Grace acted in the life and in the glory
of it, which is but little in the Christian Church to see men walk in the
power of the holy Ghost, being as Justin Martyr calls them, (...), how lovely
and amiable would the lives of Christians be, it shall be as life from the dead,
as they that have known, nay, had experience in themselves of another
resurrection, etc. 4thly To see so many lie as dead, withered branches, upon
whom the heart of God was set, and were dear unto him, they pitied you, how
much more should you pity them, that through your mercy they might attain
mercy, Romans 11.31. that is, by the sight and the apprehension of the mercy that
God has showed unto you, they may be provoked for to look out for a part in
the same mercy that was shevved toward you, when you were lost, the same will
the Lord extend unto them also, etc. 5thly Consider that their coming in shall
be without your loss, your coming in was with their rejection, the natural
branches were broken off, that tho^ might be grafted in; we can know no
reason for it, but admire the Wisdom of God; as Christ's spirit was not given,
because Christ's spirit was not glorified, etc. but now you may be of the same
Olive Tree, and you may be in the same fold, etc. 6thly You have great benefits
by it, you have much profit by their rejection, you shall have more by their
restoration, even life from the dead to you, an enriching of the Gentiles with
greater riches, then the Gentiles can enrich them, for the Lord Jesus will in a
special manner exalt the Kings of the East.

Some Objections are to be answered when God gives another opportunity. As then
suffer them to live among us, that they may have the Gospel preached to them,
that is the way to their conversion, to bring them into our land.

Ans. First, if they be here, in providence we should not cast them out. 2. If
the Jews did live among you, they were to have by the Law of God, no other
liberty among Christians, then the Jevvish Magistrates were to give the
Heathens among the Jews: if they were here, as they were not, to suffer the
Gentiles amongst them, upon the account of aiming at their good, neither might
we suffer these among us, not to abuse their worship, or set up a false
worship, profane their Sabbath, or blaspheme their God. This the Jews
permitted not to the Gentiles, nor should the Gentiles now permit the Jews. 3.
The stage and place of their conversion shall not be in the Western parts of the
world, where few of the^ are, but in the East and North, etc. Dan. 11.44. its
said, tidings out of the East and North shall trouble them, as indeed their main
residence is in those parts. 4. It shall not be by the preaching of the Gospel,
which is the ordinary way for the Gentiles, but the Lord will do it in an
extraordinary way, A Nation shall be born at once; therefore these are but the
weak plots or charitable mis-apprehensions of men (in this) ignorant of the
Scripture, and all Labors this way will be to no purpose, but let thy
compassion run out in faith and prayer, to bring the promise to the birth, etc.

FINIS.
Heedless SERVICE Unacceptable.
2 KINGS 10.31. But Jehu took no heed to walk in the way of the Lord God of
Israel with his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam which made
Israel to sin.


IN the Text are three things principally contained. First, a great service
performed by Iehu, both against the house of Ahab. and the house of Baal, with
the Lords commendation of the same, ver. 30. that he had done well in executing
that which was right in his eyes, and had done according to all that was in his
heart.

Secondly, a great reward promised by God in Recompense of this service; not ex
precio operis, but ex largitate donantis; thy children to the fourth Generation
shall sit upon the throne of Israel: whoever is a labourer in Gods Vineyard,
shall not go away without his penny, Mat. 20. God will say, Call the laborers
and give them their hire: yea to show that he loves righteousness, the unholy
services of unsanctified men shall not go unrewarded; only, indeed, as their
heart is not perfect with God in the service, so neither is his perfect with
them in his reward: ( for with the perfect only he will show himself perfect,
Psa. 18.) but the reward shall hold proportion to the service: the service
unsanctified, seemingly a service, but really a sin: so the reward shall be in
it self a blessing, but unto them a curse: the service temporal only: so shall
the reward be.

Thirdly, the person censured by the Lord: though God approve, and reward that
which is good; yet he does not justify that which is evil: neither can his
love to the one, blind his eyes toward the other: his eyes behold, and his
eyelids try the children of men. And therefore though he had done this great
service, yet in all that he had done, the Lord says to him, he did that which
was right in the eyes of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart: he took no
heed, etc.

Grace is the Law written in the heart, Jer. 3.33. the Table fleshly, the
heart: the Ministers the pen, the Spirit the Ink, and Christ the Scribe, which
is the Apostles Metaphor, 2 Cor. 3.2,3. the word is a mould, Romans 6.17. (...),
or into which you were delivered; therefore answerable to the cutts in the
mould, such must be the impression of the thing molded by it. Now in the Law,
the mould, there are two things: Precepts enjoining duty: and Prohibitions
forbidding sin: now Jehu had not the Law written in his heart, and therefore
his heart was not right with God in either of these.

First, for the Precept, his heart was not right; for he took no heed, etc.

Secondly, for the Prohibition, his heart was not right: for he departed not
from the sins of, etc. The first part of the censure is upon the unsoundness of
Jehu, in respect of the Precept: but Jehu took no heed: and therein are four
things setting forth his unsoundness.

First, his inadvertency and inconsideracy, he took no heed.

Secondly, his partiality, he took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord:
integritas objecti.

Thirdly, his inconstancy some steps he did set in this way, but it was not his
walk.

Fourthly, his insincerity; he took no heed to walk with his whole heart; Many
duties that his conscience was convinced of, he neglected; there was his
partiality: The duties which he did were perfunctorily performed, therein he
was heedless; in the best duties that he did, he had self ends, his whole heart
was not in them, there was his insincerity: and the duties that he did set up,
he did take them up and lay them down as might stand with his own worldly and
by respects: he did not walk in them, therein is his inconstancy: and in them
all his hypocrisy.

Before I come to these particulars, I will speak a word to the particle, (...)
It may be rendered, And Iehu: but because it sets forth the unsuitableness
between Gods dealing with Iehu, and his toward God, therefore our Translators
have fitly made choice to render it here by the discretive particle, but: God
had of an obscure Captain taken Iehu from amongst his brethren, and set him
upon the Throne of Israel: admitted him to the highest earthly honor: neither
was this honor personal barely as some of the Kings of Israel was, but
hereditary: God had as it were intailed it to his posterity, and spoke of his
house for a long time to come, to the fourth Generation: for which David was so
thankful: but yet Iehu took no heed.

Doctrine. All the outward blessings in the world will never allure an
unsanctified heart to serve God in sincerity, unless Gods grace and Almighty
Power go with them.

Doctrine. Not to serve God with a perfect heart, after a man has had
experience of the Profitableness of the service, is a wonderful aggravation of
his sin. Who would not have reasoned, God has for one service raised me from a
mere man to be the head of all the Tribes of Israel; what will he do for me if
I go on to serve him? if a temporal reward be so sweet, what is an eternal if
he so far rewards an unsound, what will he do a sincere service, wherein my
heart should be perfect with him? surely the Holy Ghost has not said in vain,
the merchandise of wisdom is better then silver, etc. Prove. 3.15. and all thou
can desire cannot be compared to it; and what cannot a man desire? Mountains
of Gold, Alps of Gold, sholes of pearl: but yet the trading in it, and the
returns by it, are more profitable then any temporal thing a man can employ
himself in: yet so blind is the heart of a natural man, that he cannot deduce
out of such premises such a plain inference, such an easy connection.

Behold, first a great engagement: we hold our selves bound to all services
that are lawful unto our benefactors; God had set Iehu in the Throne, and then
he took no heed, etc.

Secondly, behold a great encouragement: he that has found one way gainful,
will be encouraged to the same again: and he that has found a service
profitable, will afterward in the same service be more abundant: and though he
had found one service so gainful to him as a Kingdom, yet he took no heed
either he took no care at all to do the service, or else, which is more
probable, he took no heed to do it acceptably, to serve him acceptably with a
reverent and godly fear, as the Apostle speaks, Heb. 12.28.

But I come to the words themselves, and in them to the first part of Iehus
censure, his inadvertency: he took no heed: in the original, (...) the word
signifies to keep or observe with exactness, or the greatest diligence, that
may be, Josh. 6.18. and ye in any wise keep your selves from the cursed thing,
Psalm. 30.3. (...) If thou should observe, or straightly mark what is done
amiss, who shall stand? and the Septuagent puts (...), which is commonly used
by Christ in the New Testament, for all manner of heedfulness, diligence, and
exact observation: Iehu did not take heed, he did not observe, he did not
strictly and carefully mark what he did in the service of God, that so he might
walk before him with a perfect heart: Here is therefore, First, an evil thing
he di^ take no heed, and that was his sin. Secondly, an evil sign, he took no
heed, and therein did manifest his hypocrisy and unsoundness of his heart.

First, it is an evil thing, he took no heed, and that was his sin: now because
omnis negatio fundatur in affirmatione, and therefore here is the neglected
duty supposed also.

And so we have in this first particular three things considerable.

First, here is a duty employed, and that is heedsulness in walking toward God.

Secondly, a sin reproved, heedlesness.

Thirdly, a sign proposed, and that is, this is made a dan gerous sign and note
of hypocrisy: A false and unsound heart.

First, the duty employed is heedfulness, carefulness, exact observation in all
a man's dealing with the Lord.

The first thing that the Text presents to our view is this;

Doctoine. He that will serve God acceptably, must serve him heedfully: we may
observe it enjoined in the two great Ordinances of Hearing and Prayer: in the
one God speaks to us, and in the other we speak to God. Eccl 5.1. the wise man
directs us in the performance of all manner of services toward God, specially
those that concern his own immediate worship: and the rule is, look to thy
feet, or keep thy feet, observe thy feet; for the same word is there used,
(...) considerthy way, be well advised in what thou do. Ponder the path of
thy feet, Prove. 4.26. when thou come to perform a service unto God; this is
the general rule: then in particular he descends to the duty of prayer, and
says, be not rash with thy mouth; weigh well thy petitions and the nature of
them and grounds of them, before thou venture to put up any in the name of the
Lord: and do not utter a rash raw indigested prayer before the Lord: and to
this end, look well to thy heart, that is, be not hasty; for it is a hasty
Spirit that causes a man to be rash with his mouth: therefore let thy
watchfulness begin there; for out of it are the issues of life: heedfulness in
the heart will prove a door to thy lips, and a bridle to thy tongue: So that
here is all heed required, keep thy feet, be not rash with thy mouth, let not
thy heart be hasty, let not thy mouth cause thy flesh to err. The like
direction is given concerning hearing, by him that is greater then Solomon,
Mark. 9.23. Luke 24.8.18. take heed how and what you hear: he that has ears to
hear let him hear: that is, seeing God has given his word, and great is the
company of his Preachers, seeing also he has given you ears to hear, and
understanding to profit by it, and seeing your ears are allowd to hear such
things, let your utmost diligence be seen in it; come not to hear unless you
bring your ear with you: take heed that you hear; let not the duty be
neglected; and when you hear, take heed both to the matter, and to the manner,
take heed what, and take heed how you hear; and this heed the Apostle
expresses (...), or more excessive heed, more abundant, least at any time
(...), we prove leaking vessels, and so spill such precious liquor, Heb. 2.1.
therefore to press upon you the necessity of this duty: First, the right and
serious consideration of the nature of that God with whom we have to do, Heb.
4.13. will much enforce it, if a man's heart were but balanced with it when he
comes to perform the duty.

First, if we consider his greantess and majest; where greatness is amongst men
(who if compared to him, are less then nothing and vanity, yet) they expect in
services exactness answerable; which is given by Solomon as a ground of it,
Eccl. 5.2. he is in heaven, and thou art upon earth: therefore look to thy
feet, and let thy words be few: Consider therefore, he is the high and lofty
one that inhabits eternity, that dwells in the high and holy place, Isa.
5.7,15. Mat. 18.10. Ezekiel. 1. Job 16. therefore Christ directs us in prayer to
look upon God in heaven, Mat. 6.9. that beholding him in his greatness and
glory, our hearts may be overawed, when we come before him in his Ordinances,
Rev. 4.2,3.

Secondly, if we consider his holiness, therefore the Angels are said to be
full of eyes round about, (that is) as it were made up of nothing but
heedfulness and watchfulness in all the services that they perform unto the
Lord: and what makes them so to be? it is because they behold God in his
holiness and purity, Isa 6 21.

Thirdly, as a Judge, Romans 2.14. Joh. 12.48. Genesis 9.15. and that for this cause
he puts no considence in his Saints, he charges his Angels with folly, Job
4.18. Ezekiel. 2.13.

Fourthly, if we consider his special Presence; it is true, that because he is
everywhere present, therefore a man should walk before him and be upright, Genesis
17.1. but, when we come do to him service, he has promised a more special
presence: he walks in the middle of the Golden Candlesticks, Rev. 2.1. in the
Temple, it is said, the glory of the Lord was there, Ezekiel. 8.3,4. there he will
meet, and there he will bless, Exodus, 20.24. and to note his special presence,
it is said, 2 Cor. 6 16. (...), I dwell in them, and that is not at once and no
more, but at all times: Gods special presence: he says, I will set them before
my face for ever, Psalm. 41.12. Now to neglect God when he is present, and to
provoke him to his face, that is made a great aggravation, Isa. 65.3. that
shows a man has cast off all fear.

Fifthly, if you consider the jealousy of God, which is the argument used by
that good man Joshua, 24.19. you cannot serve the Lord, for he is a jealous
God: his scope is not to deterr them from service, for he exhorts them
thereunto, as we see ver. 15. but he says, ye cannot serve the Lord; to show
the difficulty, how hard it is to serve him acceptably, that they might do it
with the more fear, care, and heedfulness: and the ground of it is, for he is a
jealous God; Now jealousy is exceeding observant and quick-sighted, takes
notice of the least neglects, not only from a Corrival, but also from the
person on whom God has set his love; soon takes notice of the least slight and
neglect, and having once taken notice of it, we know that it does make deep
impression upon the heart; for jealousy is cruel as the grave, and is as the
rage of a man; Pro. 6.34 Cant. 8.6.

Secondly, yet to press it further, Consider the rule of this service; for as a
Christians service must be spiritual, so it must be regular, Gal. 6 10. (...),
according to this rule: it must be canonical obedience in a spiritual sense; as
the whole service must be reasonable service, so it must be word-service, Romans
12.1. therefore (...) it may be rendered, either reasonable service, or
word-service: and so the same word is rendered by our Translations so in 1 Pet.
2.2. (...), Not the reasonable sincere milk, but the sincere milk of the word,
that we may grow thereby; Now Aquina; tells us, that if the Carpenters hand
were the rule, he could never strike awry; but because it is not, but he has a
rule without, according to which every stroke must be regulated, therefore unto
that he must take heed: specially, if we consider in this rule these four
particulars.

First, it is a straight rule; there is no turning, no defect: for the Law is
holy, Rom 7.12. perfect, Psa. 19.7. it omits no duty, it bears with no sin, it
is a straight gate, a narrow way, Mat. 7.13,14. there is no rule that ever man
made, but it has still been too short, and there has been something in
particular not determined by that rule: its not so here, neither in the
actions, words, or thoughts of the heart: therefore David says, I have seen a^
end of all perfection: look upon the most perfect and exact Laws of men, and
there be defects in them; a man may be able to look to the end of them, and see
where they do fail; but thy commandment is exceeding broad; it reaches to all
persons, places, times, actions and thoughts; he could see no end thereof
wherein it was defective, it had such a latitude, Psalm. 119.96. and the more
straight the rule is, the more we ought to take heed least we strike aside to
the right or lest hand: therefore in respect of this rule, if in any thing,
that counsel of Solomon is to be taken, let thine eyes look right on, and let
thine eye lids look straight before thee, Prove 4.25.

Secondly, it is also a spiritual rule, the Law is spiritual, Romans 7.12.
directs not only the motions of the body, but also of the Spirit; it is the
candle of the Lord: the Spirit enlightened by this rule, searching the inward
parts of the belly, Prove. 20.27. opening the treasures of darkness, discovering
(...), the hidden things of darkness, and the counsels of the Lord, 1 Cor. 4.5.
dividing between the soul and the Spirit, the joints and the marrow, and is a
discerner of the secret purposes and intents of the heart, Heb. 4.12. Now the
soul of man being the act of the body, is far more active then the body, and
the thoughts and motions of it are infinitely more in number, and more suddenly
and unobservedly break forth then those of the body; therefore he that will
keep close unto the rule, had need as the Apostle exhorts, give heed to it 1
Pet. 1.19.

Thirdly, Consider also the universality, and reality of the Law; the
Holy Ghost calls it therefore (...), Jam. 2.8. that which is in all things the
highest Judge: from whence, though quatenus habet rationem foederis, there is,
yet quatenus habet rationem regulae, there is no appeal; from the Law in the
point of the Covenant and curse there is: but in point of obedience there is no
appeal: So that there is now but one Law, one God, and one Judge, and one Hell,
to the highest as well as to the lowest: and there is no appeal from it; this
Law binds Kings in chains, and Nobles in fetters as well as the meanest, Psa.
149.8. Now had not a man need to give heed to such a Law, from whence there is
no appeal, but if a man be cast, to the same Law he must still stand?

Fourthly, Consider further the harmony and coherence of this rule; they are
like Ezekils wheels, they do one involve and include another, Jam. 2.10. he
that breaks one, is gu^y of all: the whole Law, and the same authority is
wronged; and the same disposition of heart manifested in one, that would be in
the breach of them all: and would surely show it self if there were occasion,
and opportunity to draw it out: and it is the want of this right knowledge of
the rule, that makes men set light by many sins, and count them small, because
they look not upon the Law broken in respect of its harmony, and dependence,
and so see not themselves guilty of all but that man that sees the greatest
transgression in the least, and sees the whole Law broken in every deviation,
will say that he had need take heed that he transgress not in one, least he
make himself guilty of all.

Thirdly, yet to press it farther, Consider the person who thou art, that do
perform the service, and if thou be but well-acquainted with thy self, thou
shall see great reason to be exceeding heedful when thou come before the
Lord, and that in these particulars.

First, Consider, by sin we are become unprofitable, Romans 3.12. dross and
chaff, fit for nothing; and unto this add our enmity unto God; we are naturally
enemies in our minds, through evil works, Col. 1.21. and this takes off a man's
heart: that as by sin he is made unprofitable, so he has no mind to do God
service: for he is an enemy in his mind: now what a man's mind is not on, unless
he give diligent heed, he will quickly vanish in his own thoughts, and tender
to God but his labor and bodily exercise, and no more.

Secondly, in all our services unto God we are full of ignorance: we know not
how to pray, or what to ask, Romans 8.26 therefore Christ offers daily (...),
Heb. 9.7. for the ignorance of the people in the services that they do perform.
Now the less acquaintance a man has with any thing, the more heed he had need
to take; else immediately he is like to miscarry: for ignorance is the mother
of error: no man wonders to see the blind go out of the way.

Thirdly, there is in all our services much forgetfulness in respect of the
things we do know: ye have forgotten the exhortation, says the Apostle, Heb.
12.5. I thought good to put you in remembrance: though you have known and been
established in the present truth, as 2 Pet. 1.12. therefore a man had need
recollect his thoughts, and take in the whole rule, that so he may not
afterward say, it was an oversight; and his conscience condemn him in his own
account.

Fourthly, even in those things that we do remember, and actually Consider, yet
there is much dullness, and deadness, and unmoveableness in the affections
toward them: ye are dull of hearing, Heb. 5.11. therefore a man had need take
the more heed to stir up himself, and to awaken these, as Deborah does, Awake,
awake, Judge. 5.12. and as David, Awake my glory awake lute and harp, etc. Psalm.
57.8. therefore a man had need to whet and sharpen the rule upon himself as
well as upon others. See Deuteronomy. 6.7. the word signifies to whet, sharpen, to
repeat often, and with intention.

Fifthly, there is much rashness and inconsideracy in all things that a man
puts his hand unto; specially in the service of God: and therefore Solomon well
saw it to be an evil, and our nature was prone to evil; for he would never have
given that preventing Physic, Eccl. 5.2. be not rash with thy mouth. Whereas
he says, the heart of of the Righteous teaches his mouth, Prove. 16.2,3. he
speaks that specially, because Gods word in his heart he has well digested:
there is in the best men much precipitancy, many oversights, much inadvertency:
there is folly and madness in the heart of a man whilst he lives; Eccl. 9.3.
and both are hasty: therefore a man had need take heed to himself.

Lastly, there is much looseness and vanity in a man's thoughts, Ier. 4.14. how
long shall thy vain empty thoughts, that have nothing in them, lodge within
thee! that when a man sets about any duty, his thoughts will not keep to the
thing in hand, he likes not to retain God in his knowledge, Romans 1.28. the mind
of man will never leave tossing from one thing to another, till it shift out
thoughts of God, and of the spiritual part of duty: also man's mind in a duty
conversing with God, is like one that looks through an Optick-glass upon a
star, with a palsy hand: it is long before he can ken and discern it, and as
soon as he has found it, so unsteady is his hand that he loses it again; and
such is the unsteadiness of our thoughts in the most serious services. Now
seeing it is so, if ever a man will serve God acceptably, he had need serve him
heedfully: take heed how you hear, watch unto prayer, Mar. 13.33.

Secondly, here is also a sin reproved, and that is heedlesness; but Iehu took
no heed, or did not diligently observe to walk, etc. hence,

Heedlesness in a man's converse with God, is a provoking evil.

First, It is so by the Lords own sentence and censure, Isa. 29.13. This people
draw nigh to me with their lips, but their hearts are removed far from me.
Ezekiel. 33.31.

Secondly, it is so by the Saints own confession, Isa. 64.67. Our
righteousnesses are as filthy rags; there is none to call upon thy name, and
that stirs up himself to take hold of thee.

Thirdly, It is so by Gods just Judgment, as in 2 Samuel 6.7. where Uzzah
without due consideration did touch the Ark, not being thereunto called, it is
said, the Lord smote him for his error, or as the word, (...) for his rashness
and forgetfulness, and he dyed before the Lord, Now to press this upon you
also, I desire that these particulars may be well considered.

First, ordinarily, according to your care and heed in the duty, so will God
measure to you grace, and profit by the duty, Mar. 4.24. Look with what measure
you meet, shall be measured to you again: that is, look what measure of care
and preparation you bring to the ordinance, such a measure of fruit and profit
shall you carry from it.

Secondly, when either Judgment shall come, or God thus open thy conscience in
sickness or death, all these services that thou have heedlesly performed, thy
spirit in them will fade away as leaves nipped with the wind, and a man shall
have no comfort in them at all, Isa. 64.6. we fade away as a leaf in our
iniquity: that is, the iniquity of our righteousness, the iniquity of our holy
things: whereas the duties of godly men that have life, and care, and substance
in them, their leaves shall not fade, and their fruit shall not be consumed,
Ezekiel. 47.12.

Thirdly, Consider the oftener a man does perform duties in a heedless manner,
the worse he will daily grow; and what good soever he had in him before, will
surely decay, Luke 8.18. Take heed how you hear; for to him that has shall be
given; and from him that has not, shall be taken away; he that stirs not up
the measure of grace that he has in the duty, he will surely grow worse after
his performance: for in the Scripture sense, idem est non habere and non uti.

Fourthly, there is no service that thou performest heedlessly but thou art in
danger of some temporal Judgment; we see Nadab and Abihu were consumed with
fire from heaven, Lev. 16.2. And Uzzah 2 Samuel 6.7. and who can promise himself
security from the same punishment that does go on in the same sin?

Fifthly, hereby thou sinnest against a cloud of witnesses, the blessed example
of all the Saints: and it is in some respect a greater Aggravation of sin, to
sin against Example then against Precept, because the one has a stronger hand
upon a man then the other; praecepta ducunt, exempla trahunt; look to Abraham
the Father of the faithful, see how heedfully he walks with God, Genesis 18.27,30.
Seeing I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord that am but dust and ashes:
and then by and by, Oh let not my Lord be angry, and I will speak, etc. Jacob
is humbled that he was not so aware of the presence of God, as he ought to have
been, Genesis 28.16. and David was afraid when the Lord had made a breach upon
them, and cries, Oh shall the Ark of the Lord come to me! and durst not remove
the Ark till he had enquired of the mind of the Lord, 2 Samuel 6.8,9.

Lastly, it is a sin against great mercy; thou should be a vessel of honor
fitted for the masters use; and in this respect godly men prize their services
above their comforts; And amongst the glorious promises, Psalm. 10 17. Consider
this, he prepares the heart to pray, and causes his ear to hear: he will
accept the heedful service, and will give much grace: to them that hear shall
more be given, Mark. 4.24. else Mar. 1.14. Cursed be that deceiver that has in
his flock a male, and offers to the Lord a corrupt thing, etc.

Thirdly, this is not only an evil thing, but an evil sign also: and so here
made by the Holy Ghost a sign of hypocrisy and unsoundness of the heart of
Iehu: hence this Doctrine.

A constant heedlesness in a man's converse with God, is a dangerous sign of an
unsound heart, Isa. 29.13. they draw near to me with their lips; but even while
they did so, they took no care to bring their hearts with them, but they were
removed from the Lord: and this heedless performance was a sign of their
hollowness and unsoundness: So Christ says of the Pharisees, their care was
wholly about the outside of the duty, making clean the outside of the cup:
Christ made this a sign of their hypocrisy; for hypocrisy is but an outside:
like cloth of Arras, fair and beautiful without, but look to the inside,
nothing but rags and ends: now when a man's constant care is only for the
outward performance, and never looks whether the heart answer within, that is
an unsound heart: but yet I say, constant heedlesness; for the best of Gods
people are many times too rash, and hasty, and inconsiderate in their
approaches unto the Lord but it is not constantly so: neither do they rest
therein: but that man with whom it is so, surely he has nothing but a form, 2 Timothy 3.5.

Now to apply this briefly, there are in it three Directions.

First, Be humbled for the hypocrisy past: so does the Church, Isa 6.4,6. they
were ashamed of their righteousness: Hypocrisy is so exceeding hateful to God,
that he makes all their punishments to be measured out by that; they shall have
their portion with Hypocrites, Mat. 24.51. they shall have their portion with
the Devil, and his Angels: to show none so near to the Devil as they: no man so
hateful unto God or creatures but the Devil: and this is a most common and
ordinary way of hypocrisy that can be: this makes the Saints groan in
themselves, therefore Bradford did write in his Letters to his friends, John
Bradford, a very hypocrite, a very painted hypocrite: look back with how little
preparation, how vain thy thoughts, how thy eyes have wandered, etc.

Secondly, Apply the righteousness of Christ for the pardon of this amongst
other evils, Exodus 28.38. Christ must have upon his forehead holiness to the
Lord, that he may bear the iniquity of your holy things; a great part of the
holiness of Christ is appointed for this, for the pardon of your unholiness in
service.

Thirdly, be more heedful for the time to come; and to stir you up to it,
consider but only this, how heedful you have been in the ways of sin, Prove.
16.30 He shuts his eyes that devises mischief; a man that will study and be
intent upon a thing, will shut his eyes, that so objects from without do not
distract his mind, so intent is this man in a way of deceiving, Job 17.11. the
thoughts of man are called the possessions of the heart, whereupon a man's heart
does dwell; now we know upon any sinful projects and thoughts of evil, a man's
thoughts are so settled upon them, that a man cannot remove them, but there
they dwell; but as for the things of God, a man's heart dwells in them as one
does that is in another man's house, he is always going and taking his leave.

Now let this heed be seen, First, in thy Preparation: prepare with all thy
might, as David did for the material Temple, 1 Chronicles. 29.2. and say in thy
heart, as Solomon did, the house must be great and magnificent, for it is for
the Lord, 2 Chronicles. 26.6. Isa. 12.3. Come to the Ordinances as wells of
salvation, as breasts of consolation, Isa. 66.11. to see the face of Christ,
and the goings of the Lord: Come to them as the ministration of the spirit and
a Doal of spiritual gifts, Romans 1.12.

Secondly, when thou art come, take heed in the performance, be not rash with
thy mouth, let not thy heart be hasty, Eccl. 5.1,2. when thou do, do it with
all thy might, as David did, 1 Chronicles. 29.17. act all graces, stir up all thy
affections, awake my glory, etc. else when thou have done, there will be an
outside of service, but yet they will not be (...). They will be empty works,
hollow, no inward grace, or strength, or affection to fill them out.

Thirdly, to show that thou can never take heed enough, after every service
go and humble thy self before God for thy want of heed and watchfulness; say
with Abraham, I that was dust and ashes did take upon me to speak to the Lord:
and with Jacob, How dreadful is this place, it is the house of God, the gate of
Heaven: God was here, and I was not aware, etc.

Lastly, and to enable thee so to do, get the fear of the Majesty of God
thoroughly planted in thy heart, and whenever thou come before God, stir up
thy fear, and all those awful considerations that may be; for fear is the
watchman of the soul, exceeding heedful and vigilant that is appointed as the
remedy; be not rash with thy mouth, but fear thou God. Eccl. 5.7. and to this
end, walk in the fear of the Lord all the day long: walk with God in his fear
at other times: a special cause why men are no more heedful in Gods worship is,
because they give liberty to themselves, and have no eye to his presence at
other times, therefore, be thou in it all the day long.

GOSPEL EXALTATION.
MATTHEW. 11.23. And thou Capernaum which art exalted up to heaven, shall be
brought down to hell: for if the mighty works which have been done in thee, had
been done in Sodom, it would have remained unto this day.


THE Lord has not chosen one fixed place for the Gospel to reside in, unto
which all Nations that expected any benefit thereby were to resort, as he did
for the Jews at Jerusalem: that only was the valley of Vision; but now its
sound is gone forth into all lands, and there is beauty in the feet of those
that bring those glad tidings, Isa. 52.7. the Lord has now made it an
ambulatory, an itinerary Gospel, it walks from place to place, and comes home
to the doors of those who will scarce go out of their doors to it.

And wheresoever it comes, it brings with it, (...), A fullness of blessing,
Romans 15.29. It is to a place as the Sun to the world, a beam of the sun of
righteousness, Mal. 4.2. It is the rain of the earth, Heb. 6.8. it is a feast
of fat things, of fat things full of marrow, of wine on the lees, well-refined
Isa. 25.6. it is the glory of God, and the glass wherein we behold it, 2 Cor.
3.18. it is the face of Christ. 2 Cor. 4.6. the ministration of righteousness 2
Cor. 3.9. it is the dole of spiritual gifts, Romans 1.11. it is eternal salvation
it self, yea, great salvation, Heb. 2.3. Here are garments to cover your
nakedness, meat to satisfy your hunger, medicine to cure your diseases, armor
to protect your persons, and a Treasure of precious promises and sure mercies
to provide for your posterity, that so there may be nothing wanting to make it
up, a fullness of blessing.

But wherever the Lord sends this Gospel and the Ordinances thereof, he does
send it with a threefold reference.

First as donum, with reference to our thankfulness.

Secondly, as depositum, which respects our faithfulness.

Thirdly, as talentum, which respects our fruitfulness, that we may bring forth
fruit meet for him of whom we have received it, that we fall not into the sin,
and so become liable unto the censure of the unprofitable servant; now the
fruit which the Lord expects where he sends these Gospel Ordinances, is,
Repentance, and Conversion; Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand, Matthew.
3.2. The Lord lights not up this can^le, but it is to find the lost groats; he
goes not abroad in this, but it is to find the lost sheep, or to meet some
prodigal son: And though there may be fruit of an inferior nature, civility
and formality which men may bring forth, yet the Lord counts this nothing
unless repentance and conversion go before them; as ciphers they be that stand
for naught, if set alone; though they add to the Number, if the figure of
conversion go before. Christ says not unto them, Auditores, Spectatores,
Administratores ni fuissent, virtutem ejus divinam non laudavissent, and^ says
Brugens. plainly manifesting unto us, that all the rest without this is nothing
worth in Gods account; because this people was like unto the ground that had
drunk in the rain that came often upon it, and brought not forth herbs meet for
him that dressed it, not fruit meet for repentance, but rather bare thorns and
briars; therefore Christ shows that they were nigh to cursing and their end was
to be burnt, Heb. 6.8.

The words are the Exprobation of Caparnaum, and the sentence which the Lord
Christ did denounce thereupon, because they had neither answered the Lords
mercy nor expectation. First, he looked for fruit, and there was nothing but
leaves; he looked for grapes, and they brought forth wild grapes: he looked for
repentance, and behold impenitency; no man repented of his wickedness, saying,
what have I done, but they held fast deceit and refused to return, Ier. 8.5,6.
Therefore he that upbraids none propter inopiam and necessitatem, Iam. 1.5.
before they do receive mercy, yet he does upbraid them propter ingratitudinem,
after they have received: he upbraids none respectu Dei dantis, as if he did it
out of unwillingness to give; but respectu hominis accipientis, to shame and
fear the man who desires to receive. And to this end is this Exprobation used
by Christ in this place. In them we may consider, first a concession, something
is confessed and acknowledged, which was that Capernaum was lifted up to
Heaven: Secondly, a Commination; in them we may consider this place, First, in
its exaltation, and that is the highest, they were exalted up to heaven.
Secondly, in its humiliation and abasement, and that is, they shall be brought
down to hell. Thirdly, the cause of both, the cause or means of their
exaltation was the ministry of Christ, and his mighty works, ver. 20 and the
cause of their depression, their impenitency under such a powerful ministry,
and such glorious means, which is amplified by a comparison by which Christ
makes them to be more incurable then the worst of sinners, humani generis
opprobrium, the Sodomites; for if the mighty works that have been done in you,
had been done in Sodom, they would have repented and remained to this day; for
that must needs be employed, though it be not expressed.

We have first, Capernaums exaltation, and therein we are to consider the
place, Capernaum. Secondly, the glory thereof, thou art exalted up to heaven.
Thirdly, the means of this exaltation, the ministry of Christ and his mighty
works.

First, the place was Capernaum, situate in Galile, a maritine Town near to the
lake of Genezareth, and as Andriconius conceives, in the half Tribe of
Manasseh, and bordering upon the Tribes of Zebulon and Napthaly; and so that
place seems to be understood, Math. 4.14. (...), in the borders: Not in either
of those Tribes, but bordering upon them, and in the Tribe of Manasseh: The
Lord Jesus was born at Bethlehem, and then in his infancy for fear of Herod, by
Gods direction he was carried by Joseph into Egypt; there he spent as is
conceived some years; then returning for fear of Archelaus the Son of Herod,
Joseph took up his habitation in Nazereth, Mat. 2.23. and there Christ abode
till the time that he was to show himself unto Israel in the public execution
of his ministry; but when he began to preach, though he made choice of that
Contry Galilee, and not of Jerusalem and Judea, for to exercise his ministry,
and there he spent most of his time and labor, yet he passed by Nazareth, and
resolves not to make choice thereof as the place either to preach or live in;
he leaving it made choice of Capernaum, Mat. 4.13 and if you ask the reason why
Christ passed by, and showed so little respect to the place of his education
the true cause is given, John 4.44. because he knew he could have no honor
there in his own Country; therefore leaving it he takes up Capernaum for the
place of his chief residence and abode, there for to exercise his ministry,
and to manifest his power in mighty works unto the world, so that during the
time of his ministry, here he lived most, and here he preached most, and
manifested forth his glory.

Secondly, this place though in that dark Country Galilee of the Gent^les, yet
I say this place was exalted up to heaven: which expression in Scripture notes
the higest degree of Honor and Exaltation, as Deuteronomy. 9.1. Their Cities are
fenced up to heaven; that is, exceeding high: A rage that reaches up to
heaven, that is the height and extremity of fury, 2 Chronicles. 28.9. Ezra 9.6. So
Isa. 14.12. how art thou fallen from heaven O great Lucifer? Its spoken of the
fall of the King of Babylon from the top of all earthly honor, in that day
when Judgment should overtake him, and he is said to fall from heaven. So that
his meaning is, that Caparnaum was exalted to a transcendent and a superlative
degree of honor.

Thirdly, by what means was it thus advanced? How came this Town in this
obscure Country of Galilee, to be so highly honored, rather then Jerusalem? it
was only as the glory of the second Temple was greater then the former, the
Temple of Solomon, Hag. 2.9. not in the frame and fabric, not in the curious
stones and goodly building thereof; in this the glory was of Solomon's Temple,
which made the old men to mourn, who had seen the beauty of the former House;
yet the Lord says it should be greater, that is, greater by reason of his
Presence that is King of glory, Mal. 3.1. The Lord shall speedily come into his
Temple: So here it is true that Jerusalem was the joy of the whole earth:
Babylon the Lady of the world. Rome (...), yet Capernaum an obscure Town in
Galilee, which very name was a reproach, advanced above them all, by the
presence, ministry, and miracles of the King of glory; so much is intimated in
the two former verses. Christ did upbraid those Cities, because in them most of
his mighty works were wrought, that is, there he had mainly exercised his
ministry; for though the miracles only are named, yet the ministry also in
them is included, and this was the ground of their honor, by this means it was
exalted up to heaven.

Doctrine.
The Ordinances of the Gospel being set up in their Power and Purity, are a
great honor and advancement unto the meanest people and the obscurest places.

For this cause Gods Ark is called the glory of Israel, 1 Samuel 4. ult. and the
Land of Juda therefore called, Dan. 11.16. the glorious Land, and this is made
one end why God did set up the Temple and the Ordinances therein amongst the
Jews (as some interpret it) Ezekiel. 7.20. the beauty of his Ornament, he set it
up in Majesty, (...) ad excellentiam, ad magnificentiam. etc that is, not only
that there God might manifest his own glory, and there he might be glorified by
the Church, but also for the glory, honor, and advancement of that people
above all other Nations under Heaven: but where the Ordinances were corrupted,
the place is polluted, Ier 32.34. and when they were removed, the Land was
defiled, Ezekiel. 7.22. And if it were so amongst the Jews, who had only Typical
Prefigurations of Evangelical Ordinances, we may safely conclude it with the
Apostle with a (...). How much more must these needs exceed in glory? 2 Cor. 3
9. Romans 1.8. Their faith was spoken of throughout the world: there seems to be
as one has observed, tacita antithesis fidei and imperii: and the Apostle
seems to intimate that they were never so honored by their Nation, as they
were by their faith, throughout the world: as this is the wisdom, so this also
is the glory and honor of a people in the sight of the Nations, Deuteronomy. 4.7,8.

If you ask me wherein does this advancement consist that a people have by
Ordinances? I answer, it does consist in these six particulars, all of them
matters of great honor to a people.

First, it is a great honor to any people for the Lord to avouch them
publicly to be his people; this is the honor of the Sts at the last day; when
the Lord breaks up the House keeping of this great world, he will leave the
lumber of it, take it who will, but the Lord will himself own his Jewels, and
he will take them and avouch them for his own before the world, Mal. 3.17. and
this is the advancement of a people by the Ordinances; I entered into Covenant
with thee, and thou becamest mine, Ezekiel. 16.8. upon this ground the Lord is
pleased to speak of them as a people that he did specially own: and of them as
a people that had special interest in him; therefore he is pleased to style
himself the God of Israel, the Rock of Israel, the hope of Israel, and all by
reason of the Covenant that he had made with them, and the Ordinances that he
had stablished amongst them: But when once by sin the Ordinances are either
corrupted, or removed, the Lord owns that people no longer; Call them Loammi,
for they are not my people, I will not be their God, Hos. 1.9. In a common
calamity it is said, Isa. 4 1. that seven women shall lay hold upon one man,
and say, we will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothes, only let us be
called by thy name to take away our reproach: if it were a reproach amongst men
not to be called by the name of a Husband, what is it when the Lord shall as it
were give a people a bill of divorce and say, call them Loammi, they are not my
people, I will be styled their God no more.

Secondly, it is a great honor and advancement unto a people to have God
present with them, and as it were to reside amongst them; this was the
advancement of the Jews, What Nation is there so great who have God so nigh
them, as the Lord our God is in all that we call upon him for? Deuteronomy. 4.7. there
the Lord does promise his presence, and his divine blessing: In the place where
I record my name, I will come unto you, and there I will bless you, Exodus
20.34. And the Lord did never manifest his presence so gloriously as he has
done in the Ordinances of the Gospel, 2 Cor. 6.16. Therein we behold as in a
glass the glory of the Lord. 2 Cor. 3.18. What is this glass but the spiritual
administration of the Gospel, and the Ordinances thereof, the vail of carnal
stupidity being taken from the heart, and we know Quod videtur in speculo imago
non est; they are the reverberated species of the thing it self, and therefore
seeing in a glass is the clearest way of vision, next to face to face: yet thus
God vouchsafes his presence to a people in Gospel Ordinances. And in these we
have the presence of Christ also; he walks in the middle of the Golden
Candlesticks, Rev. 2. whenever you seek him, be sure he is gone down to the
Gardens of the beds of spices, to feed in the Gardens, and to gather Lillies,
Cant. 6.2. insomuch that the Gospel and the Gospel Ordinances thereof are
called the face of Christ, 2 Cor 4 6. that is, that which does as lively
represent his presence unto us, as if he were present with us in the flesh: so
that when a man shall come to behold him in glory, and to see him as he is, he
shall be able truly to say, this is the face that long since has in the Gospel
been exhibited unto my faith. What shall be the advancement of all the
Christians in glory? it shall be only the beatifical Vision, when they awake to
be satisfied with his likeness, to see him as he is; now if this be begun here
in the Ordinances, that may be well counted the advancement of a people; that
is unto them as it were the beginning of eternal glory.

Thirdly, fruitfulness also is unto a people great advancement; and on the
contrary, barrenness is a reproach, Genesis 30.23. The Lord has taken away my
reproach; but they were never so much honored by the fruit of their bodies,
though in that God made good his promise to increase them as the stars of
heaven, and as the sand upon the Sea shore, yet I say they were never so much
honored by the fruit of their bodies, as they were by the fruitfulness of
their Ordinances: They are therefore called the Bed wherein Christ does embrace
his Church, and wherein souls are begotten to the Lord, Cant. 2.16. Our bed is
green; glorious things are spoken of Zion the City of God: what be they? I will
make mention of Rahab, Babylon, Philistin, Tire with Ethiopia, it shall be said
this and that man was born in her, etc. that is, though they were strangers
unto Zion in their first birth, and so children of other Contries; but yet for
their second birth, their new birth, they shall know it to be in Zion, by means
of the Ordinances, and she shall be called the mother of them all: and this is
made the glory of a Church under the Gospel; the dew of thy birth is of the
womb of the morning, Psalm. 110.3. that is, multitudes shall be born unto it as
the drops of the dew that are begotten in the womb of the morning. But when the
Ordinances are either corrupted, or removed, Christ meets his Spouse in this
bed no more; when the son of righteousness withholds his beams, this dew is not
exhaled and a man shall not find a drop falling from the womb of the morning;
this is a great reproach unto a people: Cant. 4.2. Thy teeth are like a flock
of sheep coming up from the washing; they bear twins, and not one is barren
amongst them: by the teeth of the Church some understand the Ministers, quos
aliis erudiendis Christus praefecit; for the office of the teeth is to chew and
to prepare the meat that it may be fit nourishment for the rest of the members,
so do these. Brightman, Brightman
Dividendo, distinguendo, nodos solvendo, obscura illustrando, dentium
funguntur munere, etc. These for their purity are like a flock of sheep newly
washed, and for their fruitfulness, they bear twins, and not one is barren
amongst them, but by their labors they bring forth much fruit, and they bring
home many a soul to the Lord; but if once God withdraw his Ordinances, his
people become barren: as it is in the Church of the Jews; and it is true of the
seven Asian Churches, and many other forsaken Churches of the Gentiles; the
barren has born seven, and she that had many children is waxen feeble, Isa.
5.4.

Fourthly its a glory to a people to have store of all things in it, so that
they may be able to communicate to others in their necessities, but need not
borrow of any: this was the advancement that the Lord promised unto his people,
Deuteronomy. 28.12. you shall lend unto other Nations and shall not borrow; this is
that wherewith God has exceedingly honored this Nation of ours, and when that
we many times vainly boast that we need not for outward things be beholding to
any people; but much greater is this glory in things spiritual, and all this is
by the Ordinances; if the embryos in the womb of the Church want nourishment,
her Navil is like a round Goblet that wants not liquor: and by it the children
in the womb are nourished unto life, Cant 7.2 if babes want milk, they may suck
and be satisfied with these breasts of Consolation, Isa. 66.11. if the children
want bread, the belly of the Church, the Sacrament of the Lords supper, the
belly which receives the sustenance for the rest of the body, is like a heap of
wheat set about with Lillies, Cant. 7.2. if strong men want meat, it is to be
had in them, Heb. 5.12. and if they need water for their spiritual refreshment,
here are the wells of salvation, Isa. 12.3. and that you may not think that in
the days of drowth these will be dry, the Lord tells you, that there are
springs to feed them; all my springs are in thee, Psalm. 87. ult.

But when the Lord takes away the Ordinances, then the tongue of the sucking
child cleaves to the mouth for thirst; then the children cry for bread, and
there is none to break it to them; then they that fed delicately upon the
purest Ordinances, they are desolate in the streets, and they that were brought
up in scarlet embrace dunghills; it is spoken by the Prophet of a bodily
famine, Lam. 4.5,6. it is much more true of a spiritual famine, when men shall
run from Sea to Sea to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it, Amos
8.12. this is not only a misery, but also a dishonor unto any people.

Fifthly, its a great advancement when the Lord makes a people flourish in
outward things, making them the head and not the tail, as the Lord promised,
Deuteronomy. 28.13 and how comes it to pass that a people do not flourish? all the
outward prosperity that we have, in which we so much glory, it is only by the
Ordinances, 2 Chronicles. 7.19,20. the Lord threatens that if they did forsake his
Ordinances, and serve other Gods, then he would remove his Ordinances from
them; and the House that I have sanctified for my name, I will cast out of my
sight, etc. And what follows? then says the Lord, I will pluck them up by the
roots out of the land that I have given them: when the Ordinances were removed,
and the Lord called them Loammi, all their outward prosperity did quickly
vanish, Hos. 2.9. I will take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in
the season thereof, and I will recover my wool and my flax given to cover thy
nakedness, etc. Ezekiel. 16.39. I will break down thine eminent place: that is,
the Temple, where they did play the Harlot, and set up the Image of jealousy
before the Lord, Cap. 8. therefore the Lord will remove the Ordinances; and
what then? then they shall strip thee of all thy clothes, and leave thee naked
and bare: we therefore that count our outward prosperity our glory, consider we
hold it by the Ordinances.

Sixthly, its a great advancement to a people to be well fortified, so as to be
able in danger, both for defense and offense to secure themselves, not to fear
their enemies; this was the glory that God did vouchsafe the Jewish Nation, and
was sometime the glory of the English also, the fear of thee shall fall upon
all Nations round about, Deuteronomy. 2.25. These are spiritually the Towers of Zion,
Psa. 48.12,13. that we are bid to tell, and the bulwarks that we are wished to
mark: it is because of this that the Church is described to be terrible as an
Army with banners. Cant. 6.10. that is, because the weapons of our warfare in
them are not carnal, but mighty through God: therefore they are as great a
dread unto the enemies, as an Army set in battle-array. But as they are either
corrupted by a people, or removed from them, so does their defense depart, as
the Lord threatens, Isa. 5.5. I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall
be eaten up; I will break down the wall thereof and it shall be trodden down.
Now what was this hedge and this wall? nothing else, Musculus.
as Musculus interprets it, but the Ordinances, the Word, and Sacraments, etc.
which did serve for two ends, as a hedge and a wall ad separationem and ad
munitionem: therefore when the Lord took away the Ordinances, their defense
departed from them; and as men corrupt them, so they break the Hedge and pluck
down the wall of our protection; it is true, it may not fall at once, but one
picks out one thing, and another another, till at last they make a plain way
for the Beasts of the field to break in upon the Vineyard of the Lord: In all
these respects, and in many more, the Ordinances of the Gospel in their purity
and power are a great advancement to a people.

Surely then they are in an error that esteem the Ordinances in their power to
be a matter of disgrace, a note of indignity upon any place or person. First,
make it your glory. Secondly, walk toward it as your glory: for that which is
so great an advancement to a people, must needs be an honor to a person also;
yet such is the enmity and the folly of our nature, that we are apt to glory in
any thing (yea many times in those things that are our shame) the wise man in
his wisdom, the strong man in his strength, and the rich man in his riches,
etc. Jer. 9. and pass by that as an aspersion, which indeed would make us truly
honorable, and in comparison of others advance us up to heaven: for any thing
else to be pointed at, men count an honor, pulchrum est digito monstrari, etc.
there goes a rich man, a wise man, a great Scholar, etc. but to be pointed at,
there goes a holy man, a diligent hearer, a constant frequenter of the
Ordinances in the place where Gods honor dwells: this is an imputation, and
a matter of disgrace: and this especially in any of the higher and the greater
sort: Salvian.
It is that which Salvian in his time did complain of, p. 113. that if any
Noble man or great man begun to be religious, statim honorem nobilitatis
amittit; quantus in Christiano populo honor Christi, ubireligio ignobilem
facit. The same is the disease of the present times, that dishonor some men
for no cause but because they do honor God, of whom the world may truly say,
Thy God has kept thee from honor.

It will appear in the consideration of these things: First, what a man counts
a matter of honor, he will not be ashamed to appear to be: Paul was not
ashamed to preach the Gospel, but was abundant in it, labored more then they
all: why? because he counted it the matter of his glory, Romans 15.20. (...) it
was so his labor, that he counted it his honor too, and that made him so
abundant in it, he was willing to appear so to be: the Martyrs in the Primitive
times counted Christianity their honor, and therefore they were not ashamed to
profess with triumph before their cruellest persecutors, Christiani sumus, etc.
but amongst us we find men are loath to be taken notice of for constant
preachers, for diligent hearers, etc. because they count it will be a blemish
to their names, and may be a stop to their honor, and preferment in the world,
etc. Thus many a man is by this means kept off from the Ordinances which would
be his glory, and quodammodo mali esse coguntur, ne viles habeantur: they must
be evil, or else they say they shall be vile: if they be not wicked, they say
they shall be men of no esteem: Surely, all those that are ashamed to appear,
or to be thought holy, they count the Ordinances of God their disgrace, and not
their honor: for a good man is that Seneca, Epist. 81. Seneca.
boni viri famam perdidit ne perdiret Constantinus: let every man look into his
own heart whether it be so with him. I accuse none, but as Salvian says,
Salvian.
Si quis in se esse novit quae loquor non a mea sihi haec lingua dici aestimet:
sed a conscientia sua: not my tongue, but his own heart is his accuser.

Secondly, what a man counts his honor, that he will have recourse to, or
setch comfort or encouragement from it in disgrace, or any other calamity
whatsoever. When Mordecay refused to bow to Haman, unto what did his heart
recoyl in this contempt, as he conceived? Hest. 5.10. it is said, that he told
his friends of his glory, riches, multitude of children, and all the things
wherein the King had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the
Princes, etc. and with this he bore up his own Spirit. So it will be with the
Ordinances; if a man make them his glory, as the Lord himself tells his people,
Isa 30.20. though they were not freed from outward afflictions, though they
were fed with the bread of affliction, and the water of trouble, yet their
Teachers should be removed into corners no more, but their eyes should see
their Teachers, etc. and with this the Lord strives to uphold their hearts
against all their outward calamities; they should be sure of plenty of the
bread of life, though they did want the staff of bread; when a soul is able to
turn in upon himself, and in any calamity uphold his spirit herewith; It is
true God feeds me with the bread of affliction, but yet my eyes do see my
Teachers; and can he be hungry that is fed with the bread of life? can he fare
meanly that is always at a feast of fat things? No surely; brown bread and the
Gospel is rich provision. Can he thirst that may at pleasure draw water with
joy out of the wells of salvation? Can he be poor unto whom is daily offered
the unsearchable riches of Christ? Can he be sick to whom the Sun of
righteousness does arise with healing in his wings? and can he be alone, who is
come to the innumerable company of Angels, or the general assembly and Church
of the first born which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all?
etc. Thus we are by Gospel Ordinances, Heb. 12.22,23. Matthew. 9.2. Christ says
unto the poor man sick of the Palsy, Son, be of good cheer, thy sins are
forgiven thee: A poor man in sickness and in pain, how could he be of good
cheer? yea there is sufficient in the Gospel, and the Comforts and Ordinances
thereof, to cheer a man's heart, and to bear him up against all the outward
sorrows, and calamities in the world; if a man do make the Ordinances of the
Gospel the matter of his honor, then they will be his chiefest joy in the best
times, and his only joy in the worst.

Thirdly, a man's honor, and that which he glories in, he will lay all at stake
to defend; the people of Israel counted David a great honor to his Nation as
indeed he was, and therefore they called him the light of Israel, 2 Samuel 21.17.
and being in battle, there came Ishbebenob the Giant, and would have slain
David; but Abishai the son of Zerviah interposed himself, rescued the King, and
slew the Philistine. Now when the Giants of the world strike sometimes at one
Ordinance, sometimes at another, and think surely to quench the light of
Israel; Where is the man that has interposed himself, and born the blow that
he might succor the Ordinances? Where is the man that is of Saint Bernards
mind, Bernard.
Malo in nos murmur hominum quam in Deum; bonum est mihi, si Deus dignetur me
uti pro clypeo.

Objection But when you have said all, the world will never count these
Ordinances an honor, nor those that do frequent them to be honorable men, but
either men of mean parts, or mean fortunes, the instable multitude, etc. or
what ever a man was before, he shall never be so esteemed afterward, Si
honoratior quispiam religio ni se applicuerit: Salvian.
illico honoratus esse desistit, Salvian. p. 113.

Answer. But consider, First, though the world will not so count it, yet there
is an honor that comes from God only, John 5.44. and there is circumcision in
the heart, and in the Spirit, whose praise is not of men, but of God, Romans 2.
ult. There are indeed two great rate Books, or counts in which all the persons
and actions of men be valued; Go^s book, and the worlds; and they set upon
persons and actions different rates, for that which is highly esteemed amongst
men, is an abomination in the sight of the Lord, Luke 16.15. and there is many
a man's person and actions when they are weighed by the world, are conceived to
be great weight, and yet when the Lord comes to weigh them, are found too
light, and it is his Sentence must stand: he is praiseworthy, and that man is
honorable, not whom himself, nor whom the world, but whom the Lord commends, 2
Cor. 10.18.

Secondly, for the world, we know it is unacquainted with, and therefore unable
to esteem either the comforts or the honors of the Ordinances: for they are
men of another Generation, Luke 16.8. In estimation a great deal of wisdom and
art is seen, and that cannot be expected in those whom the Scripture does every
where brand for folly: every man may see a precious stone, but he must be a
Lapidary that knows how to value it; every man sees the Sun but he must be an
Astronomer that shall be able to measure it, and take the quantity thereof:
they that know no honor but the praise of men, its no wonder if they be not
able to judge of the praise of God, Act. 17.11. whatever the world counts of
honor and descent, the Lord says, they of Berea (...), they were better
descended then the rest of Thessalonica, in that they received the word with
readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, etc.

Thirdly, though they should count it a disgrace, yet look upon the Ordinances
always as thy honor, and value not the Judgment of such men; say, its a
small thing to me to be judged of you or of man's day: let it appear that you as
much undervalue their Judgment, as they do your ways; this was Luthers
resolution, Luther.
Non ego opprobrium Bohemi cinominis metuo quae gloria est coram Deo. Ita
concurrimus utrinque; illi extremo furore, ego summo contemptu; and vincit mea
audacia in Christo: for that thing and that person is honorable, and none
else, who is precious in Gods eyes; since thou wast precious in my eyes, thou
have been honorable, but never till then.

Use 2.
Strive so to walk toward the Gospel and all the Ordinances thereof, that you
may make it appear to the world you count it your honor, glory, and highest
advancement in the world: This concerns, First those that have it not.
Secondly, those that have it.

First, you that have it not, strive to get it at any rate, for your self, for
the place in which you live: for it is a pearl of great price, and therefore
you may do well to sell all that thou have to buy it: in other things men will
spare no cost to satisfy their ambition, give any thing for their honor, but
in this men have no ambition. Infelix prorsus ambitio quae ambire magna non
novit, Bernard.
Bernard.

You that live in the dark places of the earth, and are like to Jerico, where
it may be the Land is pleasant, but the waters bitter, count it now not only
the matter of your misery, but also of your dishonor; stir up your ambition in
this respect, to have the Ordinances of the Gospel, that may exalt you up to
heaven, and what difficulty so ever may seem to stand in the way, let them not
deterr you, anime magno nihil est magnum.

What? God will bless your riches, honor and advancement in outward things: do
not you live without this; it was the complaint of Bernard of some, Bernard.
purpura induunturcum conscientia pannosa* fulgent monilibus, and moribus
sordent: it is the very condition of many places in this Kingdom: a special
ground of it is want of the Ordinances in their power: Nay if you have good
hearts, all these outward things will do you no good if this be wanting: the
poor woman, 1 Samuel 4. ult. though they told her, Be of good comfort, thou have
born a Son; yet she answered not, neither did she set her mind upon it, but
called his name Ichabod, the glory is departed from Israel: the Ark of God, a
type of Evangelical Ordinances, Evangelium sub velo, the Ark of God is taken.
And not only for the places you your selves live in, but strive to propagate
the Gospel unto others also. Not only your duty to God and to the Gospel, your
love to the souls of your brethren, but your reference to the Land it self
calls for it: it is every Christians duty to raise the Age, and as much as in
him lies to ennoble and honor the Land and Nation where he lives: this is the
only way to make this Land to become the glorious Land, and to name it Jehovah
Shammah, the Lord is there, Ezekiel. 48. ult. You will say herein, what shall we
do^

First, Consider and strive to be seriously affected with the misery and
dishonor of those that want these Ordinances, Cant. 8.8. we have a little
sister, and she has no breasts.

Secondly, Enquire, study, set your thoughts on work about it, whether you may
relieve her; What shall we do for our sister in the day that she shall be
spoken for? Can we do nothing by our pains, by our purses, by our friends? etc.

Thirdly, resolve thou will do thy utmost as they do: if she be a wall, we will
build upon her a Palace of silver; if a door, enclose her, etc.

Fourthly, when you have done all, pray to the Lord of the Harvest to send
forth Laborers, Mat. 9.37. pray that the Gospel may run and be glorified, as
it will: that it may go forth with speed and strength, prevailing over
difficulties, and conquering all opposition; that it may go forth, as the Sun
when it goes forth in its strength.

Secondly, you that enjoy the Ordinances of the Gospel, and by them are exalted
up to heaven,

First, prize it as highly as you do your highest honor, it is worthy of all
acceptance to be received, (...), 1 Timothy 1.15. Acts 17.11. Say as St
Chrysostoms hearers, Satius esse ut sol non luceat quem ut non doceat
Chrysostomus, etc.

Secondly, preserve it and defend it as you will do your honor: if men seek to
take it away, or to hinder the Gospel in any kind contend earnestly for the
faith that was once given to the Saints, Jude 3. for the Gospel is committed to
the custody of the Pastors of the Church to preach it, but to the Princes and
people of the earth to defend it, to be a guard about it against all the
opposition and malice of the enemies: little do they consider what the cost of
our poor Forefathers was to transmit the Gospel, and the Ordinances thereof
unto us; the blood of Martyrs spilt, the blood of Ministers spent, and all was
to transmit it to your hands; Romans 3.2. Rev. 13.16,17. take heed through
carelessness and cowardliness we betray not the trust committed unto us: but
that we also by a public profession, and an earnest contention, in its purity,
convey it unto our posterity; you take care that they shall inherit their
Fathers Liberties and Honors, be as careful that they inherit their Fathers
Ordinances also; else contend by prayers, put in thy stock for them there also,
Romans 15.20. say not that it is too late now, 1 Kings 8.42.

Thirdly, honor it, Adorn the Doctrine of God and our Savior in all, Titus
2.16. it is but reason that we should honor, it which does so highly honor
us. First by studying it, despise all other knowledge in comparison of it; with
the Angels stoop down to pry into it. Secondly, prefer it above all your own
counsels, set it up in your hearts as the only rule to walk by. Thirdly, have
recourse to it upon all occasions as your only refuge, as the Anchor of the
soul in every spiritual Tempest, as a staff to lean upon in your greatest
darkness, as the ministration of righteousness, for thy Justification, the
Instrument to convey grace for sanctification, as the Golden pipes to convey
the oil of grace from the two anointed ones, Zac. 4.14. by looking into which
glass thou art transformed from glory to glory, 2 Cor. 3 ult.

Fourthly, walk worthy of your honor, as it becomes the Gospel, Phil. 1.27.
great honors stand not with base courses; seeds prima, vitaima: dignitas in
indigno, quid est nisi ornamentum in luto? Salvian.
Salvian. It is not agreeable to your honor who are exalted up to heaven, that
you should walk as if you lived in hell: not for you that are honored as
Christians, to live as Heathens: for know, the Lord is now come nigh unto you;
for his truth, his Gospel, and the honor thereof, if you walk not answerable,
will make your sins more filthy: it is like a Taper in the hand of a Ghost,
which makes him appear the more ghastly: it will ripen them the sooner, they are
like to summer fruit, Amos 8.1. and all the glory of it will be unto you but as
pitch to the barrel, it will make you burn more fiercely in those eternal
flames.

Fifthly, strive to have the excellency of every Ordinance; there is a special
power in every one: powerful preaching, 1 Cor. 2.4. Iam. 5.16. Content not thy
self with the Letter without the Spirit; be of Elisha's mind, here is the
mantle, but where is the God of Elijah? they are wells that must be drawn, Isa.
12.3. breasts that must be sucked, Isa. 66.11.

Sixthly, be sensible of the spiritual absence of God: the Ordinances
continued, and they saw nothing, but the Prophet saw the glory of the Lord
departing, and he departed not all at once, but by degrees; a soul should
strive to be sensible of each degree of his removal; when the waters increase,
a soul should take notice, and so when they decrease and grow low amongst a
people, Ezekiel. 47.34.

Seventhly, Lastly take heed of those sins that may cause your glory to depart,
and may provoke God to remove the Candlestick; take heed of all; but there are
some sins in a special manner, That cause God to go far from his Sanctuary,
Ezekiel. 8.8.

First, when men corrupt the Ordinances with humane inventions, Ezekiel. 10.4. set
up the Image of jealousy.

Secondly, when the Ordinances become a burden to a people; this is the burden
of the Lord, Jer. 33.33.

Thirdly, when men set up their lust against them, Psalm 78.58,59. The Lord was
wrath, so that he greatly abhorred Israel, and forsook his Tabernacle in Shilo.

Fourthly, unprofitableness and unfruitfulness under Ordinances: even that
ground that drinks in the rain, and brings not forth fruit answerable, is nigh
to cursing, Heb. 6.8. even those sins which may seem small in men's account for
them, God will come and remove the Candlestick except you repent, Rev. 2.5. for
know this in Conclusion, The foundation of all true peace and tranquillity in a
Commonwealth, is from the Gospel, and from them that show forth the power
thereof; and therefore if by sin you provoke the Lord in the Gospel to depart
from you, you must expect it will not depart alone, but all prosperity with it,
Rev. 4.5. Out of the Temple proceeded Lightening, Thundering and Voices; the
Lord says, Ezekiel. 10.2. before the destruction of Jerusalem, sill thy hand with
coals from between the Cheruhims, and scatter them over the City. the Jews
gloried in their Temple, and they thought Ignem Sacrum tantum valere ad scelera
expianda, that it did serve for nothing but to expiate their sins, but the Lord
will manifest also that it will serve to burn the City.

The two COVENANTS.
Preached in Bartholomew Lane, June 22. 1652.
GAL. 4.21,22. Tell me you that desire to be under the Law, do you not hear the
Law? For it is written, Abraham had two sons, the one by a bond-maid, and the
other by a freewoman; which things are an Allegory, etc.


IT was sometime the complaint of one Drex, de cultu. consc. that this is a
misery that befalls us in the Ministry above all other callings whatsoever,
that we can never find our work as we leave it: let a Plowman sow his seed, and
as he leaves his field, so he finds it after; dolabra semel dedolares, etc. let
a Joyner plain a board, and when he returns he sees the fruit of his former
labors; but if a Minister sow the seed of the word, after his departure the
enemy comes and sows Tares; let him take never so much pains to plain and
fashion a people, yet after a while he finds a rough-cast of corruption over
them: let him take never so much care to lay firm the principles of the
Doctrine of Christ, yet he shall find them soon moved away from the truths of
the Gospel.

It was the Apostles case here; he had with much labor and many traveling
pains planted this Church, but after his departure, there arose men of corrupt
minds, speaking perverse things, defaming his ministry, and opposing his
Doctrine: In this Epistle the Apostle justifies his person against their
calumnies, Chap. 1.2. and confirms his Doctrine against all their Cavils, Chap.
3.4,5.

The principle that they oppose, is, Justification by the righteousness of
Christ, without an addition of the works of the Law: for it has ever been the
manner of false Teachers, they have loved mixture: This principle the Apostle
labors to confirm them in, in these words, by setting before them the
miserable condition that they must needs be in that are under the Law in matter
of Justification; they thereby become subject to bondage, children of the
bondwoman, and forsake the liberty wherein Christ has made them free: and
this he proves by setting before them an ancient and known history, wherein he
tells them a spiritual mystery was contained: the history this; Abraham had in
a manner two wives of different conditions, the one bond, and the other free,
and by these he had two sons of like condition with their mothers; for the rule
is, partus sequitur ventrem; the son of the freewoman was a freeman, and the
son of the bondwoman was a bondman. This, the Apostle says, is not to be
taken barely as the letter sounds and no more, but there is something else
meant then the words themselves do represent unto a man (...) that is,
continuata, or perpetua Metaphora, that is, this is more then a bare historical
narration: but here the Holy Ghost had an intent to make these things in nature
types and resemblances of something answerable in the work of grace.

And the mystery is this, the two mothers are types of the two Covenants the
Covenant of works, and of grace, (...), doctrina non est matter: the two sons
are a type of two sorts of men living in the Church, the one proceeding from
the first, and the other from the second Covenant; the one born after the
flesh, and the other born by promise: the one regenerate, and the other
unregenerate mon.

The condition of these sons answerable to the condition of their mothers; the
one bond, and the other free; that is, all unregenerate men, being the children
of the first Covenant, they are bondmen, in a state of bondage; for since the
fall this mother has ever gend^red to bondage, that is, who ever were begotten
and born by this Doctrine, they were always in a state of bondage.

But all regenerate men that are born of the Covenant of grace, and are under
it, they are freemen, and in a state of freedom, because born of a free
mother: for all a man's freedom or bondage does flow from, and depend upon the
Covenant under which he stands.

Would you see an example of both these sons, the bond and the free? if you
would see an example of Ismael the son of the bondwoman, look upon Jerusalem
that now is, that is, the people of the Jews as they then stood affected, who
did seek Justification by their own righteousness, and expected eternal life by
the works of the Law, and therefore they being under the first Covenant, which
genders to bondage, they were in bondage also: see an example of Isaac the son
of the freewoman; look upon the Church planted by Christ and the Apostles, in
the dares of the Gospel, which dare not stand upon the righteonsness of the Law
for Justification, but embrace the righteousness of Christ alone, and trust
perfectly in the grace that God has revealed in his Son; and this is called
Jerusalem that is above; as Heb. 12.22. because begotten from above, and have
above their conversation; and of all free men, all regenerate men, this is
acknowledged to be the mother, and they sons of this Church in Jerusalem that
is above.

Some Interpreters I know say, that these two Covenants are not two in
substance, but that it is meant of the Covenant of grace diversely administered
under the Old Testament and under the New: in the one they were under Tutors
and Governors, and so in bondage till the time of liberty came that was
appointed by the Father.

I confess that this bondage is also spoke of in the beginning of this Chapter,
v. 2, 3, 4. under the ceremonies of the Law, the rudiments of the world, and in
comparison of the Ordinances and liberties of the Gospel, beggarly Elements;
but here the Apostle cannot speak either that those sons, or those mothers
signify the Covenant of grace diversely administered for these two reasons.

First, he speaks of men under the Law as a Covenant under the same Covenant
that Ismael was, being as he was the son of the bondwoman, that did seek
Justification by the works of the Law, according to the promise of this
Covenant, This do and live: But the people of God under the Old Testament, sons
under Tutors and Governors in their minority, and under the pedagogy of Moses,
did not seek to be Justified by the Law, nor desire to be under it, neither
were they under the same Covenant that Ismael was, therefore it cannot be meant
of the sons of God under the Old Testament. And this forces Calvin to reject
this interpretation, and to say, Calvin.
Fateor Paulum hic de talibus siliis non loqui: therefore it is spoken of two
distinct Covenants, the Covenant of Ismael, which was a Covenant of works, and
the Covenant of Isaac, which was the Covenant of grace.

Secondly, the Apostle speaks of such as being in the condition of Ismael, were
to expect no inheritance, but to be cast out at last: Cast out the bondwoman
and her son, verse. 30. Now this is not true of those that were under the
Covenant of grace under the Old Testament; for though they were for a time
under Tutors and Governors, yet they were children of the free woman, as well
as we under the Gospel, the Church of the first born written in Heaven, Heb.
12.23 and therefore were to abide in the house for ever: and though not without
us, yet together with us they were to be made perfect, H^b 1^ ult. taking the
two mothers therefore, not for the Covenant of grace diversely administered; but
for the two several Covenants that God has made with mankind, the Covenant of
works, and the Covenant of grace: the purpose of the Holy Ghost here I will set
down in these propositions, worthy to be studied and enquired into.

First, there are two several Covenants that God has made with mankind, one of
works, before the fall; and the other of grace, which since the fall God has
established and revealed to the Church.

Secondly, all those that live in the Church are the children of one of these
Covenants (that is) they be under them; for Abraham's family was a Type of the
Church, and there were two mothers and two sons. All carnal unregenerate
persons are scoffing I smaels, are the children of Hagar, they are under the
first Covenant, the Covenant of works: all godly and regenerate men are the
children of Sarah, that is, born of the promise, and under the Covenant of
grace.

Thirdly, all the liberty and bondage that a man stands in, proceeds from the
Covenant under which he stands; he that is born of the bondwoman, whatever his
pretenses and privileges be, he is a bondman; and he that is born of the
freewoman is a freeman.

Fourthly, the Covenant of works, though it was at first given as a Covenant of
liberty, and Adam under it was a freeman, yet unto man fallen it is a Covenant
of bondage: and all unregenerate men that be under it are bondmen; but on the
contrary, the Covenant of grace is a Covenant of freedom, and they that are
under it are freemen.

Fifthly, to stand under the Covenant of works which genders to bondage, is
unto all unregenerate men a desirable condition: they desire to be under the
Law.

Sixthly, the Law it self which God delivered upon Mount Sinai, though God did
publish it there with Evangelical purposes, and had no intention to set it up
as a Covenant of works, but only as a handmaid, an appendix unto the Covenant
of grace: and therefore the Apostle says, whereto serves the Law, if it were
not set forth as a Covenant by which man should attain life? Gal. 3.19. he
answers, (...), it was added, or put to, not set up by it self alone, as a
distinct Covenant, but added as a handmaid to advance the glory, and to
further the ends of the second Covenant; yet even this Law unregenerate men in
the Church make unto themselves to be nothing else but a Covenant of works, and
so though it were not given for bondage, yet in them it genders unto bondage.

Seventhly, no man can stand under both Covenants: no more then he can be born
of two mothers; he that is born of Hagar, cannot be naturally the Son of Sarah;
and therefore if a man be under the first Covenant, there must be a
translation, and that supernatural, or else a man can never be a son of the
freewoman, can never be under the second Covenant.

Doctrine.
All unregenerate men, men in a state of nature wherein they were born, are all
under the first Covenant, the Covenant of works; they be all the sons of Hagar
the bondwoman: Ismael is a Type of all unregenerate men.

A Covenant is a mutual agreement between two, voluntarily binding themselves
upon certain conditions each to other.

Man is bound unto God by a double bond: First, by the bond of Creation.
Secondly, by the bond of stipulation; the one natural, and the other voluntary,
that so the Lord may bind the creature to him by all imaginable engagements to
prevent future apostasy: for the Lord knows our frame and whereof we were made:
by the former we are only bound unto God; but by the latter God also is bound
unto us, and as before I said, he did it to engage the creature: so he does
this to encourage the creature to obedience: The Lord has, as Creator,
absolute and unlimited authority, and therefore might have commanded duty
without reward: for when we have done all that is commanded, we are but
unprofitable servants: or if he had intended a reward, he might have reserved
that unto himself, and have told the creature, you shall trust unto me: if I
think fit, I will reward you: but however I will be free: But the Lord does
not: but that man might not think much to be bound unto obedience, God himself
is pleased to be bound to recompense: Have thou served God for naught?

Now this agreement between God and man is twofold, answerable unto the
twofold state of man; First, in the state of integrity God made with man a
Covenant expressing man's duty, and promising a reward unto his obedience, and
this was faedus amicitiae: because God and man were not at variance, like that
between David and Jonathan for the confirmation of their mutual loves.

Secondly, in a state of corruption after the fall, God entered into a new
Covenant to take man into friendship again, after God and man had by sin been
set at variance, and this was faedus misericordiae, a Covenant of
reconciliation.

Thirdly, these two Covenants were made with two several heads: with the first
and with the second Adam; for under these all mankind are included; and in them
the Lord looks upon the whole nature of man; therefore the Apostle speaks as if
there were but two men in the world, 1 Cor. 15.47. the first man, and the
second man: because they are as the two common heads of all mankind.

The first Covenant was made with the first Adam, Genesis 2.9. God gave Adam all
the Trees of the Garden for meat: but one was given as pabulum animae: called
therefore non ab effectu, the tree of life: not because of any natural power in
it, either to beget or continue life: but, a significatione qua erat
Sacramentum and Symbolum vitae: as a sign signifying, as a seal ratifying and
confirming to him the assurance of that life which God had promised unto his
obedience: Now this was not a seal set to a blank: therefore it must needs be
given upon supposition, and for confirmation of a foregoing Covenant.

The second Covenant was made with the second Adam; he says not unto seeds, as
speaking of many; but unto one, which is Christ, Gal 3.16,19. he is called the
seed unto whom the promise, and with whom the Covenant was made: for as Adam
was Caput cum faedere; so is Christ also, therefore the Lord promises that he
will give him as a Covenant to the Nations, Isa. 4.2,6. for in this Adam was a
Type of him that was to come, Romans 5.14.

Thirdly, the first Covenant was a Covenant of works, so called from the
condition of the Covenant which did require personal and perfect obedience;
this do and thou shall live, Ezekiel. 20.13. and that under a penalty of a curse
for the least deviation; cursed is every one that continues not in all things
written in the book of the Law to do them, Gal. 3.10.

Fourthly, this Covenant was made not only with Adam, but with the whole nature
of man in him, for Adam was a public person, a representative head; and the
tree of life was not a personal Sacrament, but a natural, which did belong unto
the nature, and therefore the Covenant was made with the nature, and not with
any particular person only; which does appear plainly, because the Covenant
being broken, the curse of the Covenant does seize upon the nature, Gal. 3.10.
for the duty of the Covenant must needs be as large as the curse of the
Covenant; therefore upon whomsoever the curse does come, unto them the duty did
belong, and none were bound unto the obedience of the Covenant, but they that
were foederati, persons with whom the Covenant was made.

Fifthly, this Covenant is not abolished by the fall, but remains and stands in
force. Not to give life and salvation; that indeed it cannot do, because it is
become weak through the flesh, Romans 8.3. but it commands duty now, as perfectly
as it did of Adam, and that must be personal and perfect obedience: And if a
man fail in the least degree, it threatens the curse also. God speaks unto Cain
according to the tenure of this Covenant after the fall, Genesis 4.7. if thou do
well, shall thou not be accepted? etc. It is by virtue of this Covenant that
the curse comes upon men here in a degree, and in perfection hereafter. there
is no reason, that because we have lost power to obey, therefore God should
lose his power to command.

Sixthly, Lastly all unregenerate men since the fall, do stand under this
Covenant with the Lord: it must needs follow from the principles already laid:
for if this Covenant were made with Adam, with the whole nature of man, and if
it stand in force since the fall, then wheresoever the nature of man is,
because every man is a Son of the first Adam, he must needs become bound unto
the terms and condition of this Covenant; for it was made with the nature of
man, and therefore it must be universal; yet that since the fall all
unregenerate men are under this Covenant, I will further prove it by these
Arguments

First, it will appear from the conveyance of the guilt of Adams sin, Romans
5.12. As by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin, so death came
upon all; because sin came upon all: how so, seeing there be many dye that do
never sin? The Apostle answers, though they have never sinned in their own
persons, yet in him as a public person they did sin (...) in whom all have
sinned: we were all in him, and therefore we all sinned in him: now how were
men in Adam? they were in him two ways.

First, legally by virtue of the Covenant which God made with him, we were
parties therein; we were as well bound to the duty, had as true an interest in
the mercy and life promised, and were as liable unto the curse that should
follow upon the breach of the Covenant as he, and therefore all mankind fell at
once.

The Covenant it seems, that God made with the Angels, he did not make it with
the whole Angelical nature, and therefore some of them fell and others stood,
but ours being made with the whole humane nature, and we being all involved in
one Covenant, when in Adam our Covenant was broken, we all fell in him, and
therefore speaking of this Covenant, Saint Chrysostom tells us, Chrysostom
(...), the hand writing of Adams Covenant was ours, as truly as it was his.

Secondly, naturally, and so we bear the Image of the earthly, receiving from
him the same nature that he had, 1 Cor. 15.49. if he had stood, he had conveyed
unto us an undefiled nature, and we have from him a corrupt nature by the fall:
so that whatever is born of the flesh, is flesh, Joh. 3.6. now seeing his sin
is conveyed unto us, because we stood under the same Covenant with him, it must
needs follow, that so long as a man stands guilty of Adams sin, so long he
stands under Adams Covenant, and that must needs be till this sin be done away
in Christ.

Secondly, to be freed from the Law as a Covenant of works, is in Scripture
made a special favor, vouchsafed unto none but them that are in Christ, Romans
6.14. we are not under the Law, but under grace, Romans 7.1,2,3. the Law is
brought in as a dead husband, that has command over a man no more, but it is
Christ that cancels this handwriting, Col. 2.14. it is a liberty wherein
Christ has made us free, Gal. 5.1. Now how has Christ made us free from the
Law? how is it done? and how are we not under the Law? the Law has in
Scripture diverse uses; Est instar Paedagogi, regulae, fraeni and speculi, now
in all these respects believers are under the Law: it is not a handwriting
cancelled in either of them, but sub ratione pacti: so they that are in Christ,
are not under the Law, but under grace, that is, either for righteousness, or
life, for Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every one that
believes, Romans 10 4. If none are freed from the Law as a Covenant, but they
that are in Christ, then all unregenerate men who are without Christ, they
stand under the Law as a Coevnant still.

Thirdly, God deals with all unregenerate men according to the terms of the
first Covenant: for God deals with and dispenses himself unto men according
unto the Covenant under which they stand: and therefore we shall find the
dealing with those, and with believers is exceeding different, according as
they stand under different Covenants.

First, he expects perfect obedience in their own persons: indeed the Lord
requires perfect obedience still, and wherein we come short in the least
degree, we sin: but yet because the perfection is not to be found in us, it is
made up in the second Adam in the obedience of the beloved: for there is
commutatio personae, but not Justitiae: but this is not vouchsafed unto any
unregenerate man: neither a change of his right ousness, it must be perfect:
nor of his person, for it must be personal righteousness: for this Covenant
admits no Mediator: so that of all the obedience of Christ, not any goes to
perfect their obedience, and of all his sufferings not a drop of his blood goes
to take away one of their sins off the score, for they are without Christ, Ephesians.
2.12. and it is in him alone that God is well pleased, Math. 3.17.

Secondly, he rejects their most glorious works for the least failing in them;
See it in Jehu, 2 King. 10.30. God says of him: He had diligently executed
what was right in mine eyes: and has done unto the house of Ahab according to
all that was in my heart: and yet in Hos. 1.4. he says, I will visit the blood
of Iezreel on the house of Jehu: and in them, Isa. 1,11,12. though they were
things commended by God, yet he abhors them; if thou do evil, sin lies at thy
door, Genesis 4.7. whereas it is not so with them that are under the Covenant of
grace: I persuade my self many of their works are rewarded that have had (if
you look upon the thing it self) as great imperfections as there have been in
those works that unregenerate men have been punished for; if there be a willing
mind, though the work be not answerable, yet it shall be accepted, 2 Cor. 8.12.
and the good Lord will pardon a man though he be not cleansed according to the
purification of the Sanctuary, 2 Chronicles. 30.18,19.

Thirdly, he hates their persons for their works sake, Genesis 4.7. if thou do
well, shall thou not be accepted: the person's cursed for the works sake, Gal.
3.10. but under the new Covenant it is the love of the persons that makes their
Services be accepted: Abels offering was offered with sin as well as Cains, yet
Genesis 4.4. God had respect to Abel, and then to his offering: but he respected
not Cains offering because he had no respect unto his person: the weakness of
Abels person made not his services rejected, but so it did Cains: God is angry
indeed at the sins of the one: but there is ira simplex, and ira redundans in
personam: he does never hate their persons when he is angry with their works:
but he deals with the wicked under the first Covenant, hates their services for
their persons sake.

Fourthly, all things are turned into a curse to them that are under the first
Covenant; for this Covenant deserves nothing for the breakers thereof but the
curse, Genesis 2.17. and they are cursed in the Basket and in the store Deuteronomy.
28.7. their Table made a snare. Psalm. 69.22. curse their blessings, Mal. 2.2.
That Covenant being broken brings forth death: And these temporal Judgments
are but the praeludia judicii futuri: but under the Covenant of grace, unto
them all things are turned into a blessing, Romans 8.28. all things work together
for good, by their Covenant; all things are yours, whether life or death, etc.
1 Cor. 3.22. Now this dealing of God with men living in the Church under the
same Ordinances, and enjoying the same privileges being so different, there
can be no reason given of it, but merely the different Covenants under which
they stand: for God has been and is always mindful of his Covenant, and
according to it, does always dispense himself to the creature.

Use.
Let it awaken every natural man to seek for a translation: Thy misery by sin
stands in two things: First, that thou art under Adams Covenant. Secondly, that
thou bear his Image: now we many times see our misery by the one, the evil
of our ways: but few are sensible of the other, the evil of our state; and
that is the greatest: for this makes thee a bondman whilst thou live: for
the Covenant genders unto bondage, and it cuts thee off from all hope of an
inheritance hereafter: for the bondwoman must be cast out with her children.

This is the translation which the Apostle speaks of, being translated into the
Kingdom of his dear son, Col. 1.1. this is the passage from death to life, John
5.24. In this passage a of man there must be a double change. First, mutatio
moralis: a Relative change, as when of a bondman, a man is made a freeman: of
a servant he becomes a son. Secondly, Physica: a natural change: that is, when
of a sick man he is made sound; the first is the change of a man's Covenant, and
the second a change of his Image: the one is done in Justification; and the
other in Sanctification: and by both these, old things are past away, all
things do become new, 1 Cor 5.17. This translation all the people of God that
ever went to heaven had experience of; and this is that I desire all men in a
natural state may be awakened to seek after. But you will say, who be the men
that stand under this first Covenant? I hope there be none such amongst us. You
may judge your selves by these two rules.

First, he that is under the second Covenant, has an interest in him who is
the prince of the Covenant; he that was given as a Covenant to the Nations,
Isa. 42.6. for we heard before that the two Covenants were made with two
different heads; and it is union with them that brings a man under either
Covenant; it is being in Adam that makes a man stand under the one: and being
in Christ, that gives a man interest in the other: for a man must be in Christ
as he was in Adam (that is) in him legally standing under his Covenant: and in
him naturally, that is bearing his Image.

Now if a man would know whether he has an Interest in Christ or no, let him
take the Apostles rule, and lay it unto his own soul impartially, 2 Cor. 5.17.
he that is in Christ, is a new creature: he is not barely new dressed, or has
gotten a new outside, but he is within renewed in the Spirit of his mind: he
has a new understanding, new apprehensions of persons and things; and those
things which before he counted foolishness, now he does know them to be his
only wisdom; and those persons that he looked upon as the scum and offscouring
of all things, these they judge to be the excellent ones of the earth; and
those dark and carnal apprehensions of the ways of God, and the mysteries of
Godliness, that he had before, they are now done and past away, they have no
affection to them: for it is not enough for a man to have new words, and new
actions: there is many a man abstains from the practice of many sins that their
hearts love: and many a man for some respects takes up the practice of some
duties that his heart hates: but such a man now loves that which before he
hated, and he now hates that which before he did love: that which before was to
him the only matter of his joy, now becomes the only object of his sorrow: thus
he that is in Christ, is a new creature.

If so, then surely they cannot take themselves to be new creatures, that have
not so much as renewed their actions: that were drunkards and so continue: were
Sabbath Breakers, and Swearers, and Userers, and Scoffers, and so continue
still, the comfort of whose lives comes in by evil: it is their meat and drink:
they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence, Prove. 4.27.
Its their clothing: Pride compasses them as a chain, violence covers them as
a Garment, Psalm. 73.6. and it is their recreation: it is a pastime for a fool
to do wickedly, Prove. 10.23 and there be no recreations that have any pleasure
in them unless they be sweetened by sin: surely thus walking in their old ways,
it is impossible they should be new creatures; and not being new creatures,
they are not in Christ; and not being in Christ, the Prince of the Covenant,
they have no interest in the new Covenant.

Secondly, he that is under the first Covenant, is a bondman as Ismael;
whereas he that is under the second Covenant is the son of the freewoman, and
receives from the Lord by that Covenant a free Spirit, Psalm. 51.12.

First, he is in bondage by earthly engagements, he can have no engagement but
it is a snare to him: The false Prophets were honored by some of the Kings of
Israel: therefore they could not speak the truth to him, neither to reprove his
sin, nor to discover the mind of God. I must do such a thing though it be
against my conscience, to give such a man content: I must not reprove such a
sin, because it will displease, etc. the Prophet Michaiah had a dis-engaged
Spirit in this respect.

Secondly, in bondage unto sin and under the power of their own lusts, that
though they may see many evils in themselves, and confess it, yet when occasion
and opportunity serves, and the lust represents it self, they are no more their
own, thy cannot resist Eyes full of Adultery that cannot cease to sin. 2 Pet.
2.14. and as men use to say, they cannot choose, etc.

Thirdly, in bondage unto the creatures under the power of them, 1 Cor. 6.12.
one man cannot live without his honor, another without his minion, another
without such an estate: and all the thoughts of their hearts run out about such
things, and are wholly busied about meat, and drink, and clothes, and money,
and play, and this wholly drinks up their spirits.

Fourthly, in bondage under the guilt of sin, and slavish and servile fears;
they go all their life long with a galled conscience, filled with fearful
apprehensions of death and Judgment: for they all their life long for fear of
death are subject to bondage, Heb. 2.15.

Consider seriously of these particulars: and unto such men I speak, as being
as yet under the first Covenant; and I exhort them to seek to be translated.

I speak not this to make the first Covenant which God made with Adam, vile in
your eyes.

For first, it was a great favor that God would be pleased to make a Covenant
with the creature: for we did owe him service, though he had never promised a
reward.

Secondly, the person with whom this Covenant was made, was the most excellent
of any mere man: never any so full of perfections as he: so fit to be head, and
so likely to convey grace unto us, as Adam was; and therefore the Lord made the
best choice for us for the establishing of this Covenant: for had we our selves
been to choose, seeing his perfections, we would rather have put the keeping of
our happiness into his hands, then have kept it in our own.

Thirdly, there were great things promised by this Covenant, Genesis 2.9. all the
good things of this life, and eternal happiness with God in the life to come.

Fourthly, it was the same Covenant that God made with the best of the
creatures, even the glorious Angels: they stood by it, and owe their happiness
to it at this day: which appears by Gods dealing with the Angels that fell: he
cast them off for one transgression, Jude 6. and they that stood, stood by
virtue of the same Covenant which they broke that fell: and by virtue of that
Covenant being now confirmed in their estate, they daily behold the face of
your Father which is in Heaven.

Fifthly, to put an end to all: it is the same Covenant that the Lord Christ
himself stood under: for he was made under the Law, Gal. 4.4. that is, not only
the Ceremonial and Judicial Law, as a Jew, but as a man also under the moral
Law, Gal. 4.4. being bound to his obedience, and to suffer the curse thereof:
for he was our surety, Heb. 7.22. and the surety is bound in the same bond with
the principal; and therefore he was made a curse for us: which is the proper
fruit of the Law as a Covenant of works, Gal. 3.13. in all these respects it
was a glorious Covenant.

But men should be awakened to seek to be translated, whether we look upon this
Covenant, and man's standing under it in his state of innocence, or in the state
of sin.

First, in the state of innocence, so if he had stood, he might well have
desired to have been transl^ted out of this Covenant, if we consider it and
compare it with the Covenant of grace.

Secondly, this was a Covenant made with a mutable head; Adam, though he were
an excellent creature, yet he was but a creature: and it is true of all men,
that they were given to change, Prove. 24.21. now for a man to have all his
happiness inbarked in a creature daily subject unto change, must needs imply an
imperfection in their condition: but the Covenant of grace is made with Christ
an unchangable head, and therefore because he lives, we shall live also, Ioh.
14.19.

Thirdly, the Covenant it self was a changeable Covenant, and therefore by
reason of sin there is a change thereof unto all that believe: and the Lord
has introduced a second and a better Covenant; but the Covenant of grace is an
everlasting Covenant, Genesis 17.7. a sure Covenant, 2 Samuel 23.1,2. so that
nothing can arise de novo, to disannul it.

Fourthly, the promises of this Covenant were far in feriour unto those in the
Covenant of grace: it is a Covenant established upon better promises, Heb. 8.6.
in this indeed God did promise life here and hereafter, but he did not promise,
I will be thy God: I will give thee my Son: and I will give thee my Spirit; I
will be thy God: that is, all the Attributes that be in me, shall be as truly
thine for thy good, as they be mine for my own glory: thou shall have my wisdom
to direct thee, my power to protect thee; if thou sin, thou shall have my mercy
to pardon, my grace to rule, and my glory to crown thee.

Fifthly, the righteousness of this Covenant was a far less glorious
righteousness; for it should have been the works of righteousness that we had
done, Tit. 3.5. but the righteousness of a creature: but the righteousness of
the second Covenant is the righteousness of God himself, 2 Cor. 5.21. not the
essential righteousness of God; but a righteousness answerable unto the Law,
unto which the Godhead gave both efficacy and excellency, Heb. 9.14

Sixthly, the Condition of this Covenant was less glorious: for it was Doing;
but the Condition of the 2d was believing; and this is most glorious, because
it sets a man upon the highest way of glorifying God; for all acts of obedience
in Adam did but glorify God in his Law; but this is glorifying of God in his
Son; which is the highest glory, Ioh. 6.29.

Seventhly, Lastly, the power of performance was far inferior: for that was to
be done by man alone, by the strength of grace received without any further
supply; and grace unassisted, what can it do? but under the second Covenant,
though the work be to be performed by us, yet the supply of strength is Gods;
it is God that works in us both to w^ll and to do, Phil 2.13.

Thus if we look upon man in his integrity under this Covenant, he has reason,
seeing the new Covenant is offered, to desire to be translated.

Secondly, but if we look upon man as fallen, then all those that stand under
this Covenant have reason to be awakened, to be transplanted.

First, by virtue of this Covenant, sin is imputed and laid upon a man's own
score; Noxa sequitur caput; the soul that sins shall dye, Genesis 4.7. Sin lies at
thy door; so that thou though have heard talk of the death and suffering of
Christ yet, not a drop of his blood shall go to take off one sin, or one
torment from thee: for thy Covenant admits no commutation.

Secondly, it is a Covenant without a Mediator: for then there needed no middle
person; no daies-man to lay hold upon both, Job 5.9. so now since man is
fallen, all that stand under this Covenant converse with God immediately, they
have no Mediator to bear their sins, or to offer their sacrifices.

First, to offer their sacrifices, so that in all their services they come unto
God immediately; First, thou have none to bring thee into the presence of God,
whereas by the second Covenant we have (...), boldness and access, Ephesians. 3.12.
we have a manuduction to the Father by him.

Secondly, when we come to God we have no Priest to offer our sacrifices, and
so they can never be acceptable unto the Lord; for whosoever should offer a
sacrifice of himself without a Priest, that soul was to be cut off from his
people. Yet this is your condition under the second Covenant.

Thirdly, there is none to perfume them, and take away the failings of them; to
bear the iniquity of your holy things, Exodus 28.38. to perfume your prayers, to
wash your tears: Lava lachrymas meas Domine.

Fourthly, if Satan object any thing against thee, thou have none to make
answer for thee, for thy Covenant admits no advocate.

Lastly, if any services be required, thou have none to help thee, but thy own
might; no Christ to strengthen thee; no Spirit to help thy infirmities, Romans
8.26. as it is with the people of God in the Covenant of grace.

Secondly, none to bear thy sins, or sufferings; and so wrath must needs come
upon thee immediately; it comes upon the godly under the second Covenant, and
Christ the Mediator stepped between, and he bare the curse, being made a curse
for us, Gal. 3.13. but when the Lord shall come to pour out his wrath upon
thee, thou may rather hope to prevail with the Rocks and the Mountains, then
with Christ; he will not appear for thee, but thou must wrestle it out with the
wrath of the great God for ever; and it is a fearful thing to fall into the
hands of the living God, Heb. 10.30,31. there must needs be Judgment without
mercy, and fury without compassion, when the Lord will stir up all his wrath,
and none step in to bear one drop of this storm for thee; for thy Covenant
admits no Mediator.

Thirdly, it is a Covenant under which unto man fallen there is no hope of
reparation; First, it promises no repentance after sinning: it belon^s to the
second Covenant, that Christ shall give repentance unto Israel, Acts 5.31.

Secondly, it promises no space to repent, but Genesis 2.17. the day thou eatest
thou shall dye; and so they had, had not Christ stepped in, Rev. 2.21. space to
repent is not from the first Covenant.

Thirdly, if a man did repent, this Covenant promises no acceptance upon
repentance; it says indeed, Genesis 4.7. if thou do well thou shall be
accepted: but it faith not, if thou do evil thou shall upon after repentance
be accepted: therefore this is a man's miserable condition, and this it must be
by this Covenant for ever therefore the Devils are in a hopeless Condition,
because the Covenant under which they stand offers them no mercy after sinning:
and God has not revealed unto them any other Covenant; and the same is the
condition of every man by this first Covenant: only men have this privilege,
that they have a second Covenant offered unto them, upon which they may lay
hold with hope of mercy: therefore neglect not these glorious offers: seek the
Lord while he may be found: close with the grace in the new Covenant; know the
day of thy visitation; for if thou be found at the last day under Adams
Covenant and untranslated, thou must expect no other, but to bear thy own sin
and shame for ever.

Let this awaken you to seek, first for a change of thy Covenant; and then
afterward for a change of thine Image: many men labor to change their ways,
and to abstain from many sins: but whilst thou art under this first Covenant,
thy Covenant promises no grace to perform duties; thy Covenant promises no
acceptance; therefore the first thing that a soul should set upon, is to seek
to God to be translated out of that Covenant, that bondage under which by
nature he stands.

FLESH SILENCED BY Gods arising.
A Sermon Preached before the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of London, on a
Thanksgiving day at Christ-Church London, July 26. 1651.
ZACH. 2. ver. ult. Be silent, O all flesh, before the Lord, for he is raised
up out of his holy habitation.


IT is the great honor of the Saints, that they are made the Temples of the
Holy Ghost, and the Priests of the most high God, that they may offer to him
spiritual sacrifices acceptable to him through Jesus Christ. The sacrifices of
the Jews were of two sorts. Some were (...), Propitiatory Sacrifices, for the
obtaining of pardon, and peace, and reconciliation after sins committed: there
were other sacrifices that were (...) peace offerings, a returning unto God of
thanks, and praises for blessings received. When God did put into the hands of
his people a cup of consolation, for that is the Prophets expression in Ier.
16. then did they take the cup of salvation, the cup of benediction, and
returned unto God again, Psalm. 116.13. You have both these sacrifices in the
spiritual sense of them under the Gospel; and the Lord delights in each of them
in their seasons: Sometimes the Lord calls his people to mourning, and it is
dangerous to deceive the expectation of God. Sometimes he calls them to
rejoice: Consider in Heb. 12.23. you are by the Gospel taken into Communion
with Angels, and your Communion with the Angels in a great measure does consist
in bearing a part with them in your praises; it is the action of heaven, and
requires hearts in heaven to join with it: therefore the hearts of the Saints
are so described, Rev. 19.1. I heard a voice of much people in Heaven, saying,
Amen, Hallelujah; it is spoken of the Saints upon earth: it is usually in that
book styled the Church of God in heaven: but how? when they praise God, they
are a great multitude in Heaven. The Countries that have most staple
commodities in them for exchange, you know they have the freest and the fullest
traffic: The most glorious intercourses between heaven and earth, is in
mercy: and the most glorious return between earth and heaven, is in grace,
praises, and the returning of mercies into themselves: ad locum unde exeunt
gratiae revertantur, Bernard.
says Bernard: it is a returning of mercy into the same fountain, the same
bosom of love from whence it flows: it is indeed the habitation of God, that
next to heaven he delights to dwell in: he inhabiteth the praises of Israel.
These considerations I desire to premse, that you may a little observe of what
weight and importance the services that you now go about are.

For the words that I have read to you, that you may find out the meaning and
scope of the Holy Ghost in them, it is necessary that we look into the story,
the context, and the connection of the verse, which I shall briefly give you,
and I entreat you diligently to mark: The Babylonian Monarchy having trodden
down the City of God, the holy City, and laid wast the Temple, and worship of
God for seventy years: that time being expired, the Lord according to his
promise, delivers his prisoners out of the pit in which there was no water.
Deliverance was proclaimed by Cyrus the first King of Persia: this liberty some
of the Jews undervlaued, and they still chose rather to abide in the Land of
their captivity: to them is the speech directed in the 6. ver. of this Chapter,
Ho, says God, come forth, and stie from the Land of the North: they might have
had liberty, but they embraced their former bondage: those that did accept of
deliverance, and returned into their own Country, they were no sooner
returned, but there rose a Samaritan faction, their neighbors, those that were
neither Gentiles by profession, nor Jews by religion: these did labor to their
utmost to retard the settlement of this people newly returned into their own
Land again, labored to keep the City and Temple in their ruins, and to that
end by their interest and power in foreign Nations, they had engaged against
them, even the whole authority of the Persian Monarchy. Now, when the hopes of
the enemy grew high, and when the hearts of the Saints fell low: what is the
way God takes to remove them now? why now a Prophet must go to them, he sends
Zachariah the Prophet, and bids them, Return to your strong holds ye prisoners
of hope: your strong holds? why, their City was laid wast, their Temple burnt
with fire: strong holds they had none: satis praesidii, in un Deo, Calvin.
Calvin. There is enough strength in one God, even then when walls and
fortifications fall. Why now, that the Lord might bear up their Spirits in this
condition, he reveals his mind (as the manner of the Lord was in those times)
unto his Prophet by several Visions: in an especial manner in this Chap. and
the latter end of the former Chap. he does it in a double vision. In one, the
Lord tells him, that be the powers of the enemy what they would be, though they
saw no help, none to oppose them: yet the Lord would raise up an adverse power
that should break them, though they knew not whence it should come: And he tells
them in the 21. ver. of the former Chap. there were four horns that did push
Jerusalem: and the Lord says, I will raise up four Carpenters, and they shall
beat them in pieces: equal to the horns, so shall the Carpenters be.

In the next place, in this Chapter, the Lord shows him another vision, a man
with a line in his hand taking me asure of the City Jerusalem, and of the
Temple, as the manner of Builders and Artificers is to do. Jesus Christ does
usually appear to his people according to those great things that he is about
to effect for them: when the people were to be carried into Captivity, Jesus
Christ then appears clothed in linnon, with a writers Inkhorn by his side,
Ezekiel. 9.1,2. and when the instruments of vengeance come, Jesus Christ comes in
the midst of them: the man with a writers Inkhorn was in the midst of them:
what to do? to mark those that were written to life in Jerusalem. First, before
the instruments of vengeance can stretch out their hands against any, the man
with a writers Inkhorn will set his mark upon those that are written for life:
But when the people returned out of captivity, now Jesus Christ appears with a
line in his hand, for he it is that must build the Church: so you have it in
the 6. Chap. 12. ver. Behold the man whose name is the Branch, he shall build
thee, he shall build the Temple of the Lord: no wonder then, that when the
Temple and City is to be built, Jesus Christ appears with a line in his hand.
This is the Vision.

Now observe in this Chapter three things, that I may bring you home to the
words read to you.

First, you have the Vision it self: the man with a line in his hand.

Secondly, you have the interpretation of the Vision: Jerusalem shall be built,
and the City shall be inhabited.

Thirdly, you have a threefold Apostrophe that the Lord infers from this.

First, directed unto the Jews that yet continued in Babylon, the Lord calls
them; deliver thy self Oh Sion, that dwell with the daughter of Babylon.: It
is barrenness and lowness of spirit not to accept deliverance: it is pity but
those men that say they love their Taskmasters, they should have their ears
bored, as a token of perpetual service. The Lord calls upon them, Oh Sion that
dwell with the daughter of Babylon, deliver thy self.

Secondly, the next is to the enemies that were their neighbors: the truth is
my Brethren, it was a good observation that of Tertullian unto the Church;
Tertul.
there are tot hosts quot extranei; all that be strangers, be enemies; now the
Lord speaks unto these, and tells them, I will shake my hand against you, and
they that spoil you, they shall be a spoil to their servants; their own
servants shall spoil them.

The third and last branch of this Apostrophe is in the words that I have read
unto you; the words of the Text, and it referrs partly to the enemies; and
partly to the people of God that were returned out of captivity: be silent Oh
all flesh; for the Lord is raised up out of his holy habitation: Let the
enemies silence their murmurings, silence their slanders: Be silent Oh all
people. Let the Saints silence their frettings, silence their doubtings, for
the Lord is raised up out of his boly habitation.

You have then in the words two things.

First a Proposition; The Lord is raised up out of his holy habitation.

Secondly, an inference by way of Exhortation, or Command thereupon: Be silent
before the Lord, Oh all flesh.

The Proposition is first in nature, though it be last in place: and therefore
I must first speak of that, and then afterward of the Application.

First then, the Proposition is this: the Lord is raised up out of the
habitation of his holiness.

Here are two things to be explained before I can come unto those points that I
purposed to commend to you.

First, I must show you what is meant by the habitation of his holiness: And,

Secondly, I must show you how the Lord is said to be raised up.

The habitation of his holiness is used two ways in the Scripture. It is
sometimes put for heaven; in 2 Chronicles. 30. ult. it is said, their prayer came up
to his holy habitation, even unto heaven. So in Isa. 63 15. look down from the
habitation of thy holiness, and thy glory: why then the habitation of the
holiness of God, is Heaven.

Secondly, it is many times put for the Temple, the place of Gods presence
amongst his people, manifested in Ordinances: so the Tabernacle is called Gods
habitation, in 1 Samuel 2.29. And the Lord is said to be at Jerusalem. Brusius.
Brusius interprets it of the former. Calvin.
Mr. Calvin of the latter; we may very well by way of subordination take in
both, for I conceive the sense will be made up with both: all the Churches
deliverances, as well as all the enemies destructions, they come out of heaven:
the sword is bathed in heaven before it comes down upon the people of Gods
curse in Judgment, in Isa. 34.3. and yet all these, whether deliverances, or
destructions, are obtained by the prayers of the Saints in the Temple: so that
you may well ascribe it to both. Observe I beseech you, and it is a mighty
truth: the Saints have as glorious a hand in the Government of the world, as
they shall have an eminent hand in the Judgment of the world. There is a
threefold Authority that was erected by Christ when the government was taken
into the hand of the Son as Mediator. First, a Government of Angels: the spirit
of the living creatures is in the wheels, Ezekiel. 1.20. Had not Jesus Christ had
the Government in his hand, the Angels should never have been principalities
and powers; their authority came in with the Government of Christ.

Secondly, the Authority and Government of Magistrates and Ministers came in
with the second Covenant: August.
istud nomen culpa meruit non natura: so Augustine. But there is, another kind
of Government.

And that is, the Saints being taken into Covenant with Christ, they have a
great hand with him in the Government of Christ: in Romans 10.18. the Apostle
says, their sound is gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the
ends of the world. This is spoken of the Sun, in Psalm. 19. how can this be
applied to the preaching of the Gospel? I conceive the accommodation runs thus:
As the great God has stretched out the Expansum caeli super mundum naturalem,
the heaven over the natural world, so he has stretched forth the glorious
Expansum verbi super mundum rationalem, the word over the rational world: Now
be pleased to consider, when the people of God put Prophesies and Promises in
suit, beholding the several conjunctions and aspects of them in the world,
truly, those things that are done by Gods power, they are done also by their
prayers: they have a strange hand in the Government of all things. There is a
double voice in the Book of the Rev. vox e throno: vox e templo: You read of a
voice out of the Throne: and a voice out of the Temple: Bright.
Mr. Brightman I remember puts this difference, and has this hint, vox e
throno, says he, is that, quando immediate aliquid a Deo proficiscitur, when
any thing comes from God immediately: But vox e Templo, quando precibus
sanctorum aliquid Impetratur: that is, when any thing is obtained by the
prayers of the Saints, that is a voice in the Temple. Now I entreat you to
observe, this is the first thing: This holy habitation is heaven, in the Text.
The Lord sets so high a price upon the services of the Saints, that they
have a very great hand with him in the Government of all things. It is
Augistines speech that I have met withal sometimes in Luther: August.
he professes, aliquid bonum opus licet agreste and sordidissimum est
pretiosius caelo and terra: the meanst good work of the Saints, be it never so
poor, never so ordinary, he says, it is more precious then Heaven and Earth^
there is more in it, because it has so great a power with God: it is no
wonder: then if the Lord be said to be raised up in his Temple. Well, that is
the first thing.

Secondly, but how is God said to be raised up? how can it be said that God
should rise? the word in the Original that is here used (...) it signifies
E^somno excitari, for a man to be raised up out of sleep; the very same word
that you have used in Psalm. 44.23. (...), Awake Lord, why sleep thou? awake
Lord, or arise Lord: for it is such a rising as is after an awaking out of
sleep. How can God be said to sleep? and how should God be said to awake and
rise? The cessation of acts of providence is Gods sleep: the putting of them
forth is Gods arising, Gods awaking: as when a man sleeps, sleep binds up
his senses in reference to their proper objects, that they cannot act: why so?
when the Lord does not act, does not appear for his people, then is the Lord
said to sleep: when he does act for them, and providence puts forth it self
gloriously, now the Lord is said to be raised up, God is awake. Now observe I
pray you: when the Lord breaks the designs of the Churches enemies, when he
blows upon their counsels, smites them in the hinder parts, puts them to a
perpetual shame, why then does the Lord arise as a Giant refreshed with wine,
Psalm. 78.65. So that now the meaning is this; When the Lord does appear for his
people as a return of their prayers, when the Lord arises gloriously for them
for their deliverances, and their enemies overthrow, then it is said, the Lord
is raised up out of his holy habitation. But I must hasten.

The Observations that I shall give you from hence, are two.

Doct. 1. The first is this, The great comfort of the Saints in all their
straits and difficulties lies in this, when they see God arises for them; for
here is that now that they have pitched upon to comfort themselves with. I say,
the great comfort of the Saints in all their straits and oppositions, and
difficulties, is in this, when they see God arise for them in his providential
actings.

Doct. 2: Secondly, Experiments of Gods rising in acts of Providence are great
grounds to his people to stay their fait^h^, that God will go on, he will bring
his work to perfection: for both these, (I conceive) are intended in the Text:
God is raised up, therefore fear not, though you have no men rising; God
already has manifested that he is raised up; do not doubt but he will carry on
the work. These two things I conceive the Lord intends in the words: And this
I mean to make the Doctrinal part of this Sermon. I pray observe them.

I will begin with the first: It is the great comfort of the Saints in the
midst of all their difficulties and oppositions, to see God arise for them in
his providential actings. In the opening of it I shall speak to three heads.

First, there is a time when God seems to sleep: when the Lord seems to set
still as a mighty man that cannot save; you know in Zach. 3.9. the vigilance of
providence is compared to seven cyes: and sometimes the Saints of God do even
think that all these seven eyes are asleep together: but yet you must know, he
that keeps Israel never slumbereth nor sleeps: but as it is said of the
Saints (I sleep, but my heart waketh) in their spiritual failings; So likewise
it is true of the Lord in his providential actings, his heart awaketh toward
his people, even then when every eye seems to be asleep. There is a time when
God will bring his people low, and he does it in design. Observe it, Jerusalem
is sometimes put into a cup ready to be drunk off, that the enemy should think,
it is no more to devour them then it is to drink, as you use to say to a
proverb, I can do it as easy as to drink, The state of the Church is brought
unto that low ebb: But now mark, then says the Lord it shall be a cup of
trembling: there is a time when God seems to lay all his power aside, Rev
11.16,17. he has taken unto himself his great power; God is always
omnipotent; but for a great while the power did seem to be in the enemies
hands, as if God had put all power out of his hand: I, but he can reassume it
when he will: he takes to himself his own great power, and rai^eth himself: it
is a most glorious Scripture, and full of all consolation, that in Zach. 1.8
Jesus Christ was on horseback, he had an Army following him in battle array all
in a readiness; the Church saw no succor all this while: the enemy came on:
none appeared but the enemy: he was behind the myrtle trees in the bottom,
says the text: the Lord many times seems to sleep, appears not, when yet
notwithstanding his heart is on the business: as I say the Saints sleep, but
their hearts wake in their spiritual failings, so does the Lord toward his
people in his providential actings. Well, that is the first thing for the
opening of the Doctrine.

Secondly, The great labor of the Saints in all their straits is to awaken
God, that God may arise; their business is not to raise armies, and forces,
powers of men; no my Beloved; their great business therefore is to raise up
God, Psalm, 68.1. Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: whether any
body else rise or no, that is nothing: Let God arise; in Psalm. 44.23. Awake
Lord, why sleep thou? stand up for my help, lay hold of the spear: (I, God
must do it) and stop the ways: O, stand up for my help: the great business of
the Saints has always been to raise up God; Awake, awake, put on strength, O
arm of the Lord, that is the Churches prayer. Art not thou he that did cut
Rahab, and wound the Dragon? it is spoken of the destruction of the King of
Egypt: the great business of Saints has been always to get God to arise.
There are two things commonly awaken God: two things cause him to rise up
presently. The one is the prayers of the Saints; Because of the cry of the
poor, and of the sighing of the needy, I will rise, says the Lord, Psalm. 12.5.
the truth is my Brethren, God cannot sleep when you pray: it was a golden
speech that of Tertullian, Tertul.
Deum orationibus ambimus, caelum tundimus, and misericordiam extorquemus:
(...), Basil.
Basil. We knock at Heaven gates, we environ God, beleguer God by our prayers,
we as it were wrest mercy out of his hands. Be pleased to consider this is one
means: when the Disciples were in the storm at Sea, what was their great
business? their great business was to awaken Christ, and then immediately the
storm was over, and there followed a great calm, and they were at the Haven
where they would be: God is awakened with the prayers of the Saints.

Secondly, the Lord he is awakened likewise by the blasphemies of the enemies:
truly, you have many times, even my Brethren, beheld how that the very end of
Gods rising for you, was because of the rage of the enemy; I will awake and set
him at rest from him that puffs at him, because of the rage of the enemy: the
enemies cruelty does cry loud in the ears of God, as well as the Saints
prayers: Now this being the great end that the people of God propound, truly
when God arises they are satisfied: let God arise, and they can sit down
secure, be the difficulties and oppositions what they will be: in fine
acquiescit appetitus efficientis. It was a strange spirit that possessed Steven
you will say, that he was able to lie down to sleep when the stones flew about
his ears: having so said, he fell asleep: what is the reason? why, I see heaven
opened, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God: Christ was up for him:
Christ standing; why, Christ is said to sit at the right hand of God; how does
Steven see him standing? standing tanquam sui sudex, and vindex, as one that
would judge, and one that would avenge his quarrel; and truly he could lie down
and sleep securely. Lord Jesus receive my Spirit; and when he had so said he
fell asleep. The great business of the Saints then in all their difficulties is
to get God to arise: that is the second thing.

In the third place: The consolations of the Saints must needs be very great
from the arisings of God for them in his providential actings; though men do
not rise, though Armies do not rise, yet I say, they are mighty consolations to
see God arise. And that upon these three grounds, Observe them I pray you.

In the first place: When the Lord does arise, whatsoever stands in
opposition must fall: God will rise up alone, that assure your selves;
whatsoever stands in opposition I say, must fall; yet many times poor creatures
we look upon Armies, and multitudes of men, and we think now, Oh alas, here is
now no hope, but the Church will presently be overwhelmed: mark; you have seen
sometimes a black smoke arise out of a Chimney, that you would think it would
threaten even to darken the Sun in its orb: but mark, in Isa. 13.3. I
wilscatter them says God, as smoke out of a chimney when you see Nations and
multitudes combine, they are confederate as thorns: when you see them
confident, drunk with confidence as the Drunkard, then shall they be consumed
like stubble fully dry, Nahum 1.10. it was a good intimation that of Cyprian,
Cyprian.
ne attendas numerum: never observe the number: they be so many thousands, and
so many thousands: certainly when God arises, whatsoever stands in opposition
must fall, for God will rise alone; that is the first ground of the Saints
consolation.

Secondly, when God arises, he over-ruleth the spirits of men, over-ruleth the
malignity of the spirits of men, so as they shall effect and accomplish his
end: ^ou may see, Psalm. 76.9,10. When God shall arise to Judgment, the wrath of
man shall praise him: verily, and the mainder of wrath thou shall restrain; my
Brethren, though we consider little of it, yet we owe very much to restraining
grace; I say we owe very much to restraining grace^ in the Saints indeed I
conceive restraining grace and renewing grace to be one and the same habit, as
Justifying faith and Historical faith is; the Saints owe very much to
restraining grace; that in their own persons; but they owe much to restraining
grace in reference unto others. This is exercised two ways.

There are restraints upon men's actions, and there are restraints upon men's
lusts: God restrains not the Devils lusts, he lets them out to the utmost, but
he restrains his actings: but for men, the Lord sometimes restrains their acts,
and sometimes their lusts: No man shall desire thy Land: God would lay a
restraint upon their lusts: now when God arises, then I say, he so orders the
spirits of men, that so much of their rage shall be let out as shall accomplish
his ends, and the remainder he will restrain.

In the third place, the Saints have a great comfort in Gods rising for them
upon this ground; when God arises, he has abundance rise with him: I say, if
the Lord old rise alone, he is able to do it; but whenever he arises, he
has abundance rise with him: When the Lion roars, all the Beasts of the
forest trembl^: Observe I pray you: when the Lord comes to Judgment against a
people, if he does but say, cause the instruments of vengeance to draw near,
they come every man with a slaughter weapon in his hand immediately; Ezekiel. 9.1.
so when the Lord rises up to execute vengeance upon an enemy: I will give you
but one place; but it is a very glorious Scripture, observe it I pray you, Dan.
10.20. there is an Angel come to comfort Daniel, and instruct him, and he tells
you: now says he, I go forth against the King of Persia, and when I am gone
forth, the Prince of Grecia shall come: mark, God rises up, as the Text tells
you (for it referrs to the same) when God rises up once, then truly there is
an Angel up, and together with him, all the power of the Grecian Monarchy;
When I am gone forth (says he) then the Prince of Grecia shall come; mighty
wars there were between the Grecian and the Persian, until the Persian were
subdued before him: Now, how came it to pass? the Angel went out first to fight
against the King of Persia: when God rises up, then I say there be abundance
rise with him. These are the grounds of the consolation that the people of God
did take from the rising of God in his providential actings for them. There is
a word more that I would speak to. A question will rise now in every one of
your mouths.

Oh, But how should a people know? when by his spiritual eyes can he discern
that God is raised up? we see men rise, an arm of flesh: but how shall we be
able to say, God is raised up out of his holy habitation; that were comfort
indeed, if we could conclude that: but what if men rise without God?

Why now, in answer to that, I entreat you give me leave a little. When God is
raised up for a people, he uses to cause magnam conjunctionem, a great
combination as it were, and a joining together of these five things (observe
them, I beseech you) and truly I think we may speak it with thankfulness to the
glorious praise of our God they have very far concurred in the Lords rising
among his people in England.

In the first place, When the Lord is awakened by prayer, that is the first
thing; prayer is Gods way by which he is raised up, Job 8.5,6. If thou make thy
supplication to him, he will surely awake for thee: If thou make thy
supplication to him: what is the reason that God was raised up for his people
here? he was raised up by prayer: look into Zach. 11.12,13. the Lord Christ he
comes, and prays, how long will it be ere thou have compassion upon
Jerusalem, against whom thou have had indignation these threescore and ten
years? why now what is the return? The Lord answers the Angel with good
words, with comfortable words, I am jealous for Sion: as soon as ever Christ
prays, my Brethren, he prays your prayers: if ever prayer arise, God
arises: I am jealous for my people. That is the first. You shall know when God
arises, if he be awakened by prayer: and truly, we had cause to hope in the
beginning of our troubles, that the Lord did pour a large measure, a plentiful
measure of the Spirit of prayer upon his people.

Secondly, when the Lord defeateth the counsels of the enemy, turns their plots
upon their heads: I beseech you observe; the Lord is known by the judgments
that he executes, when the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands; when
the Lord takes men, and burns them like Bees in their own Hive: truly that is
an argument God is up; men could not do that: God brings men's ways eminently
upon their own heads: you have a Scripture very remarkable, Micah 4. (for I
dare speak nothing to you but what I have a word for I the enemy say, that they
would come together, and they would thresh Sion; why now says God, they know
not the thoughts of the Lord; these are their thoughts: I bu^ they do not know
mine; why, what were (...) thoughts? Gods thoughts were to make their (...)
against the people of God, to be the means of their own ruin: their own
counsels should destoy them; for so he says; they shall be ga^hered toge^er as
sheaves in a flore: arise and thresh O daughter of Son^ they thought to come
together to thresh the Church: I, but says God, they themselves shall be
threshed; they shall be gathered together as sheaves to be threshed; it would
be horrible ingratitude for any of us to overlook the manifold appearances of
God in this kind in these latter days, and not confess the Truth. That is a
second ground, how we may know whether God arise for his people.

In the third place; when the Lord takes away the hearts of his enemies; truly,
my Brethren, the discipline of Spirits is not in men, but in the Father of
Spirits; when it shall be truly said, the men of might have not found their
hands when that shall befall them that the Lord threatens in Nahum 3.17. their
Captains shall be like the great Grass hoppers in a Sunny day: the Sun arises
and they are gone; when their strong holds shall be like ripe figgs falling
into the mouths of the Eaters; when God shall make the very names of men
terrible to the enemies, certainly God has the Discipline of Spirits: when it
shall be said, the sword of the Lord, and the sword of Gideon; and that as it
is said, a Barley Cake shall overthrow the Tent, this is the Lords doings.

Certainly, God does arise, In the fourth place, when the Lord acts the
Spirits of his people unto high, and noble and invincible resolutions; draws
them out to resolutions more then men; when he guides their strength, when he
girds up their spirits to the busine^s: in Zach. 4 6. Not by power, nor by
might, but by my Spirit: how did the Spirit of God do it? truly, it is the
Spirit of God working in the hearts of men, raising up their hearts to
encounter with the greatest difficulties, to look a thousand deaths in the face
with boldness, and elevating the spirits of men beyond what or linarily is in
men, this is the Lord, the Lord rises when it is so.

And then in the last place, when the Lord goes on in ways of mercy, and draws
out his loving kindness, sometimes the Lord may step forth for his people; and
he may withdraw himself again, and then the misgivings of their hearts will be
ready to say, it is the Lord is upon us: but when the Lord holds on a continual
tenor of mercies, when it shall be said as it was to Joshua there is no man
shall stand before thee all the days of thy life, I am with thee: Is it so my
Brethren? then all men must conclude, surely the Lord is raised up out of his
holy habitation: And this is the first point.

The second I shall speak a little to, but very briefly, that I may come to the
second general in the Text: I am loath to trespass, or to straighten him that
succeeds in the service* The second Doctrine that I propounded to you was this,
Dostrine.
That the experiments that the Saints* have of the rising of God for them in
some Providential actings, are a sure pledge to their faith that he will go on
the will not leave the work till he has brought it to perfection: so observe:
I will give you but one Scripture, Psalm. 74.14. he smote the head of Leviathan
in the water, and he gave him to be meat to the people inhabiting the
wilderness: the Lord here does encourage them against those great difficulties
that they were to meet withal in the wilderness after they came out of Egypt:
why now what is the use that they must make of the affliction of Pharaoh, and
his Army called the head of Leviathan there, his power, his policy, his
strength? the Lord brake the enemy: Why, the text says he gave it to be meat
to the people: Why, did the people of Israel in the wilderness feed upon the
dead bodies of the Egyptians? No, that is not the meaning of it: but this; he
gave it to be food to their faith, not to their bodies; for their faith to feed
upon in all those ensuing difficulties that they were to meet withal in a
howling wilderness: in decretis sapientium nulla est Litura, Wise men make no
blots: when the Lord has begun, he uses to go on: if he open the first seal
against Rome Pagan, he never leaves till he comes to the seventh seal. If he
sounds the first Trumpet against Rome Christian, he goes on to the seventh. So
having begun to pour out some of the Vials against Antichristian Rome, surely
the Lord will never leave till the last vial be poured out. So it is a great
encouragement to the Saints, the great experiments they have had of the Lords
rising for them in his providential actings, that the Lord certainly will go on.

Oh but will you say to me, If we could be assured of that: but what if the
times should turn? there are changes in the right hand of the most high: what
if we should see a new face upon things? I know these are the suppositions of
every heart here: Now I entreat you consider: I confess there is an ultima
clades adhuc metuenda: there is a great cloud that yet hangs over all the
European Churches: pray observe what I say: the killing of the witnesses I
cannot look upon as past, because I cannot find the time of the prophesying in
sackcloth and ashes to be expired; and Rome Antichristian, as well as Rome
Pagan under Julian, shall have its three years and a half; but yet for your
comfort let me tell you, the experiments that you have had of Gods providential
actings may secure your hearts that they shall never prevail, so as to put out
that l^ght of the glorious Gospel that God has set up among you, they shall
never prevail so far. Rome has a time of seduction, and a time of persecution:
the time of Romes seduction is over, though it is true, the grand persecution
is to come. Angustine (I remember) tells us that there is a threefold
persecution that the Church of God should undergo. August.


The first is violenta, by force.

The second is fraudulenta, that is in a way of heresy.

A third should be and violenta, and fraudulenta; there should be a deceit mixed
with force. Now I entreat you be pleased to consider: there be these three
arguments that I have looked upon as a great stay to my own thoughts in this
respect; I shall crave leave to propose them to you.

In the first place, the Apostle Heb. 12.27. tells us, that the Lord does shake
the things that are made, that the things that cannot be shaken may remain: he
shakes the things that are made, that they may be removed, that the things
that cannot be shaken may remain: then the end why the Lord has shaken in
Church and State whatsoever is of man, what the Lord will not have to continue,
it is that he may remove it. Why now this is the great end then that the Lord
has, that things that cannot be shaken should remain: Whatsoever Jesus Christ
has removed, all the power of men shall never exalt: for he did shake it to
that very end, that he might remove it: I say, what the Lord has removed, as a
thing made moveable, all the powers of men shall never be able to establish
again. Jesus Christ will maintain the ground he has won. That is the first
Argument. Yea,

In the second place: when Christ rides forth for to Conquer, he conquers not
at once, but he will go on to conquer: that is another argument: you may see
him going forth, Rev. 6.1,2. he rides forth conquering and to conquer: he did
not conquer all at once, but he carries on the victory. Luther (I remember)
said when he began, Luther.
brevi efficiam ut Anathema sit esse Papistam: it shall not be long says he,
but by the grace of Christ I shall bring it about that it shall be looked upon
as a cursed thing to be a Papist: God has carried on the work still; and I
remember it was the speech of Latimer one of our Martyrs when he came to be
burnt, I hope I shall kindle a fire this day in England shall never be put out;
Romanum nomen de terra tolletur: Certainly, the Lord Christ will carry on his
work for he conquers not all at once, he goes on conquering, and to conquer.

In the third place: Consider I beseech you, the ten Kingdoms shall destroy the
whore: that is my third argument: the ten Kingdoms are the Instruments God will
use. Antichrist rises in a double beast, Rev. 13. in his civil power; so he
makes up one beast with the ten Kingdoms. In his Ecclesiastical he makes up his
ten Kingdoms in the Clergy: that is the Beast that has two horns like a Lamb:
he speaks like a Dragon. Now observe I beseech you; these ten Kingdoms the Lord
will make use of to destroy the Whore: therefore he must reserve a considerable
party: Nay, a major party, that shall hate the Whore: who shall become chosen,
and faithful: the Lord has been pleased to make this one of the ten Kingdoms:
certainly the Lord will uphold a major party here: those that shall keep
themselves, that be Virgins, not defile themselves with the fornications of
Antichrist: and the Lord will raise them up for this great service: and they
shall stand with the Lamb upon Mount Sion. Consider I beseech you this: and
then when you look about upon those glorious providential acts of God for you,
truly, you may comfort your selves with this, the Lord is raised up out of his
holy habitation: he has begun, and he will carry on the work. And so much now
for the first branch of the Text; the Proposition: the Lord is raised up out of
his holy habitation. The inference that follows upon it, I shall speak but
briefly to: only I pray you lend me your diligent ear, and with that I shall
conclude. I would be loath to trespass in respect of time.

The Lord is raised up out of his holy habitation: what then? be silent Oh all
flesh before him. That is the inference: be silent O all flesh before the Lord.
These words Interpretets referr both to the Churches enemies, and to the people
of God who were returned from the Land of their captivity. The particle,
Interjectio est silentium Imperans, Jerome.
Ierom. Oh, that is here used, is a kind of Interjection by which the Lord
commands silence, and not a silence of the tongue only, but silence of the
soul: My soul keep silence unto God: There is a double silence in the world.

Some men keep silence in policy, because they would not discover themselves
till a convenient time. But all the people of God that will approve themselves,
they must keep silence in duty: Well,

First then: Let us look upon enemies, and as it is a direction to them, a
command laid upon them, Oh all flesh be silent before the Lord. I here is a
double ground of all ungodly men's silence; and I find it used so in Scripture.

First, there is a silence from shame, Psalm. 31.19. let the lying lips be put
to silence, that cruelly and despightfully speak against the righteous;
silencing may be by shame.

Secondly, there is a silencing of men wi^h fear, and astonishment, Psalm
107.41. he sets the poor on high with Princes; the righteous shall see this
and rejoice, and all wickedness shall stop their mouth; men shall be amazed to
see it. There is a silence from shame, there is a silence from fear: then it is
as if so be the Lord should have said, unto all the Churchs enemies, for shame,
or if not for shame, for fear suppress your murmurings; away with your
boastings, your censurings, your slanderings. Keep silence Oh all flesh before
the Lord; why now, give me leave to enforce it a little. All those that are
enemies unto Gods actings among his people, give me leave to speak a word to
you, if any such are here, as in most of our Congregations it is like there are.

When the Lord is raised up out of his holy habitation, does gloriously appear
in providential actings for his people, then see that you keep silence; I say,
away with your murmurings, your disputings, your censurings, your slanderings;
and let me enforce it upon these four grounds; remember them.

First know, the Lord hears all your murmurings; the Lord takes notice of all
your censurings; sometimes men in design keep silence, because they dare not
speak out; But remember what the Lord told his people when they murmured
against Moses, Exodus 16. the Lord tells them, that they have not murmured
against thee, at the 7. ver. they have not murmured against thee, but they have
murmured against me. When God appears in Instruments, and you evidently see the
hand of God with them: then, when you murmur at these Instruments, you murmur
against God: remember that, and the Lord takes notice.

In the second place: It is a far greater Judgment for a man to be given over
to a froward fretful spirit under an affliction, then any affliction that can
befall him: I desire that it may sink deep into all your hearts: I say, to be
given over under an affliction, to a froward, and a fretful spirit, is a
greater judgment then any affliction can befall him: for a man to be like a
wild Bull in a Net, full of the fury of the Lord; the cross he cannot bear, and
yet he cannot avoid it. I entreat you consider, it is worse then any other
judgment can befall you; it is the Devils sin, and it is the Devils
punishment: mark this I say, it is the Devils sin, and it is the Devils
punishment: the Lord crosses him in all his designs, and yet notwithstanding
for all that, still his spirit risseth up against all his acting: and so, envy
is his sin, and his plague: now do you mark; it is true all sins are from the
Devil, but yet some are from him per modum servitutis: others per modum
Imagini: in some sins you do the Devils work, but in some sins you bear the
Devils image: and I beseech you consider: this is the condition of every man,
so far as he is given over to a froward, fretful, perverse, discontented spirit
under the providential actings of God toward his people: Consider I beseech
you, it is this that makes Hell: this makes Hell, when a man is under the hand
of God, that yet he cannot bear it, nor he cannot avoid it. It was a good
speech of Bernard, Bernard.
Ubi non est propria voluntas, non erit infernum: take away a man's self-will,
and truly you take away hell: this is that my Brethren makes it be so: when an
affliction lies upon a man, all that while his will continually rises against
the dealings of God, and he frets against the hand of God upon him, it is the
greatest Judgment could befall him.

In the third place: This will certainly hinder your repentance. It is a sad
Scripture that, and so much the more sad, because it has an aspect upon the
times in which we live, Rev. 16.9. you read of the Vial poured out upon the
Sun: the highest authority in Church and State: so far as it holds to Rome. Now
the Text says, that men should be scorched; the same Vial that was poured out
upon the Sun: I say now, that men should be scorched, exceedingly fretful,
perplexed in spirit: and what follows? why, the text says, they blasphemed God
that had power over these plagues, and they repented not to give God the glory.
My Brethren, there is not a greater Judgment befalls men in these days, then
through a fretful spirit against the instrument, to neglect the hand of God,
and not repent and turn.

Yea, in the last place: that I may draw to wards a conclusion: This will
provoke the Lord (I assure you) for to bring greater plagues upon you:
therefore take heed to it, to keep silence before him when you see Gods hand
upon you, Isa. 26.11. When the hand of the Lord is lifted up, they will not
see, but they shall see, and be ashamed, for their envy at the people, says
the Text. My Brethren, God works Judgments in lesser characters at first;
and truly if men cannot read it, he will write them in more eminent and capital
Letters: small judgments, they will not open wicked men's eyes: truly, neither
will they stop wicked men's mouths; and if they will not do so, assuredly God
will have a way for all wicked men to stop their mouths: therefore if you
would not have Judgments increased take heed when you see the Lord appearing
for his Church providentially acting, the Lord is up then; Say to thy own soul,
Let all flesh be silent before him: That is the first: looking upon these words
as referring to the Churches enemies.

A word I shall add, looking upon these words as referring to the poor
distressed Jews who were now returned out of the Land of their Captivity; but
there was a mighty power of the enemy against them: why yet says the Lord, do
you keep silence: silence your doubtings, silence your frettings.

Silence your doubtings. It it said of Abraham, Romans 4.20. (...) he did not
dispute the business, pro and con; and truly, neither must you; if God be up,
leave the work in his hand: leave off your doubtings, leave off your doubtings
upon conjectures and suppositions. That is the first: Let all flesh keep
silence; silence your doubtings

Secondly, Let all flesh keep silence: silence your frettings: says David,
Psalm. 39. I kept silence, I was dumb says he, for it was thy doings. A
terrible Judgment befell Aaron; two sons were taken away by an immediate
stroke from Gods hand, and Aaron held his peace: his spirit did not rise, and
discontentedly fret at the present dispensation; Oh, ye that fear God, take
heed, when the Lord arises for his people; keep silence before him: silence
your doubtings, silence your fret tings. That I press by four considerations,
and so I shall conclude; I beseech you mark them You that fear God, that know
his name, that expect an interest in all that mercy that the Lord intends for
his people in the latter days, take heed I say, that ye keep silence before
the Lord.

First, Consider but this: will you contend with God? will you I say, contend
with God in Judgment? the Lord challenges that; Who will appoint me a time?
who will contend with me in Judgment? Will you dispute the business out with
God? Consider, Gods Judgment is the last Judgment: and his Judgment is an
eternal Judgment: from his Sentence there is no appeal: it is the worst course
that a man could take, that is to be Judged, to undertake to contend with his
Judgment before God: therefore take heed of it you cannot contend with God in
Judgment, Job 9.32.

Secondly, should not the Sove^aignty of God put you to silence? though it may
be all the actings of God be not according to your will, should not the
Sovereignty of God (I say) stop your mouths ^ has not the Lord reserved to
himself the power of Kingdoms? Depoint Reges, disponit Regna: he it is that
disposes Kings, he it is that disposes Kingdoms: now I beseech you observe
this seriously; this did silence David; I was dumb, and opened not my mouth, it
was thy doings: truly, had I looked barely upon man, it was such a thing I
could not have born, if I had looked only upon instruments; but when I looked
upon him as my Sovereign and absolute Lord, then (says he) I was silent before
him.

In the third place, consider this, A fretful spirit, even in Gods own people,
does strangely blind their eyes that they cannot see the goodness of God in the
mercy, but take many times that which is a high and glorious mercy, they take
it to be a cross and an affliction: My Brethren observe, envy will strangely
hoodwink a man: when the hand of the Lord is lifted up, they will not see: why?
for their envy at the people, they text says; it is an evil frame of spirit in
a Christian; a froward, discontented, fretful spirit, a spirit ill becoming a
Saint: your wisdom should hinder it: Solomon tells you, a man of understanding
is of an excellent Spirit, (...) frigidus spiritu, he is a man of a cool
spirit, a man of understanding: a great many men will speak of their
understandings, and their zeal many times: but know, that a man of
understanding is of a cool spirit. Consider, the Spirit of Christ comes in the
form of a Dove; be innocent as Doves, without gall, (...), sine fell, and sine
dolo: so the word signifies; the Dove is without gall, as well as without guil;
and truly that is a spirit becoming a Christian; and the want of this my
Brethren, makes many deny the most glorious actings of God toward his people:
when many times, even an Heathen man, a stranger standing by, is ready to cry
out as he did: truly, it is a glorious God, the God of the Christians. Alas,
they will not look upon it, they cannot see it: envy I say, strangely bleareth
the eyes, take heed of it therefore.

In the last place, and so I have done: Consider, does the wrath of, man work
the righteousness of God? the Apostle S. James tells you clearly the contrary:
certainly, you that will maintain Gods cause, you must do it by Gods means; the
Lord needs no carnal weapons, no help of any body, no fleshly interest to
maintain his spiritual cause; no: I entreat you consider it: when if ever you
will carry on the cause of God, let it be done by the means, and with that
spirit that God requires. I dare undertake you shall find that of Nazianzen a
good rule, Nazian.
Let us be weak, that we may overcome; I, that is the way, the way to overcome
men, or to manage a cause, though you say it is the cause of God: I say it is
not to be done by humane heats, and fleshly animosities; therefore this is that
I shall leave with you for the present, in these five considerations farther,
and so have done. First, God has never set up any authority, or way of
government, but he has reserved to himself in his providence a power to change
it at his pleasure, Zach. 21.10. Remove the Diadem, take away the Crown: God
will show himself to be King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. Secondly, it is his
ordinance that there should be a Magistracy; they are called the shields of
the earth: the stay of your tribes; the foundations of the earth: and it is not
good there should be an Anarchie: for God has set Rulers over men: some by
providence, some by promise. But yet God sets them over them: that should be
enough to restrain men of giddy spirits, who are like the children of Belial,
without a yoke: therefore let us not go about to pluck up our own bedge, and
destroy our own foundations, Hab. 1.13. The fishes of the Sea have no Ruler
over them, but devour one another: The Persians at the death of their Kings,
have (...), on purpose that men might find the evil of it: therefore be not
unruly, boisterous spirits, like the raging Sea. But be content to submit to
the bounds that God has set you. Thirdly, though this Government be an
Ordinance of God: yet the extent, and specification of it is but an humane
creation, 1. Pet. 2.13, (...), and does arise merely from the compacts and
agreements betwixt men: Rex debet esse sub Deo, and sub lege, quia Rex Regem
facit, Bracton.
Bracton. 4ly. It is a Judgment God threatens on Magistrates, Zach. 11.16.
that their right arm shall wither: they may lose their ruling power amongst
men; and that justly, both in reference to God, and men. Fifthly, in all
difficult cases it is best to go the safest way, that a whole Nation perish not
through their own wilfulness: I shall add no more. When the Lord rises, when
the Lord is raised out of his holy habitation; then as all unregenerate men,
let them silence their murmurings, silence their slanderings, and censurings:
So all you that fear God (for you are but flesh) silence your doubtings,
silence your srettings before the Lord. And so much now shall serve for this
Text: The Lord give you understanding in all things.

THE Duty and Dignity OF Magistrates.
A Sermon Preached at Laurence Jury, Sep. 29. 1651. at the Election of the Lord
Mayor.
ZACH. 10. ver. 4. Out of him shall come forth the Corner: Out of him the Nail:
Out of him the Battle bow: Out of him every Oppressor together.


LAws are in Scripture called the foundations of the Commonwealth, Psalm. 11.3.
Magistrates also they are the Pillars: when the Lord intends to go fotth in
Judgment against any people, he goes forth against them in both these: he
gives them Laws that are not good; and ^udgements by which they shall not live,
Ezekiel. 20.25. And he does send them Magistrates also that shall establish
iniquity by these Laws, Psalm. 94.20. But when the Lord returns unto a people in
mercy, he does give them righteous Laws, and gracious Rulers. In this Chapter
you have the Lord returning unto his own people in mercy. There is a double
visitation of God: One of his enemies in wrath; the other of his people in
mercy. His enemies in wrath, in the former verse before the Text. I was angry
with the Shepherds, and I did punish the Goats; it is spoken of those former
tyrannical Governors that ruled over them; sometimes called Shepherds, in the
11. Chap. ver. 5. their possessors slay them, and hold not themselves guilty;
and their own Shepherds pity them not. Sometimes styled Goats: oppressing
Governors are commonly so called in the Scripture, Isa. 14.9. All the Rulers of
the earth: it is the same word in the Original, all the Goats of the earth: for
Goats feed high: they are of all creatures most lustful: and yet amongst the
creatures very unuseful: nec ad bellum prosunt, nec ad aratrum: a fit
resemblance of Oppressors. This was the Lords visitation now of his enemies in
wrath.

Secondly, he visits his people in mercy: and though the appearances of God
in this visitation were glorious: for he was mightily seen in their
deliverance: yet he makes themselves to be the instruments to effect it: God
does it, but he does it by themselves: I will make Judah as a goodly horse in
the battle: the excellency of the horse is in the battle, Job 39.21. he meets,
he goes forth to meet the armed man: he does mock at fear, and he turns not
back from the sword, for thou have clothed his neck with thunder; such a goodly
horse now does the Lord make his own people to be in the battle: it is ordinary
in Scripture for God to resemble his people to all sorts of warlike
instruments, Zach. 9.13. I will bend Judah for me: and fill the bow with
Ephraim: Judah is the bow, Ephraim the arrows: as there they are resembled to a
bow in the battle, so here they are Gods charging horses, they are my goodly
horses. It is true indeed, the Lord is the rider, the motions of these horses
are ordered by him: and when the victory is, now it is not the horse wins, it
is not the horse conquers, but the rider: yet notwithstanding they are my
goodly horses for the battle. Thus you see the Visitation of God. First, of his
enemies in displeasure. Secondly, of his people in mercy.

Now the words that I have read to you, set forth a glorious promise that God
makes unto his people when they were delivered; Out of Judah shall come forth
the corner: for I should not read it as it is in your books: out of Judah came
forth (...) the word in the original is in futuro, out of Judah shall come
forth: this is the promise, when God has delivered them. Out of Judah shall
come forth the Corner: Out of him the Nail. Let us look into the meaning, and
the difference of these words a little: surely, all Scripture was written for
our learning.

First then, the promise is, Out of him shall come forth the Corner: what is
that? (...) the word in the original is, and is commonly a Metaphor used for
Magistrates and Governors: I shall give you several places. Look into Judge. 20
2. and all the chief of the peeople came together: (...) All the corners of the
people came together, 1 Samuel 14.38. draw near hither all the Corners of the
people; all the chief of the people; that is, all the corners of the people.
Isa. 19.13. the Princes of Zoan are become fools, they have seduced Egypt; even
they that are the stay of their tribes, you read; it is in the original, they
that are the corners of the Tribes: Then by the Corner is here meant
Magistrates. And there are three great Reasons thereof, or three things wherein
the Analogy does lie: why the Magistrates should be called the corners of the
people.

First, the cornerstone laid in the foundation, aedificium sustinet, it
upholds the building: the main weight of the building lies in the cornerstone:
so you shall find it used, Isa. 28.16. behold I will lay in Sion a precious
Cornerstone; (...) a foundation: the Lord Jesus Christ is made the foundation
upon which the building of the Church stands: and there is the main stress in
the cornerstone, 1 Pet. 2.6.

Secondly, the cornerstone does not uphold the building only, but parietes
conjungit: the cornerstone joins and coupleth the wall; it is a uniting stone:
so you shall see the Metaphor used, Ephesians. 2.20,21. Christ is said to be the
Cornerstone, in which all the building is fitly framed together, (...), fitly
framed together.

Thirdly, and lastly, the cornerstone aedificium ornat, it adorneth the
building: so you shall find the Metaphor used, Psalm. 144.12. Your daughters
shall be as cornerstones, polished after the similitude of a Palace; because
there is more labor spent in polishing the cornerstone, then in the ordinary
stones of the building; Anguli prae aliis aedificiorum partibus exornari
solent. Meller.
Meller. Now in all these respects see how fitly Magistrates are called the
corner: the weight of the building they uphold. The several parts of the
building they unite. And the whole building in both these they adorn. Then this
is the first, Out of him shall come forth the corner.

Secondly, Out of him shall come forth the Nail: What is that? It is a Metaphor
used likewise for Governors. You have that clear place in Isa. 23.23,25. there
is the removing of one bad Governor and the setting up of a good: Shebnah is
removed: Eliakim is exalted: the Lord says of them both, they are a Nail
fastened in a sure place. A Nail fastened in a sure place shall be removed, says
the Lord, speaking of the displacing of Shebnah; and I will fasten him as a
Nail in a sure place, speaking of the exalting of Elikaim. There is a double
Analogy, or proposition in that Metaphor.

First, Clavibus connectuntur, and compinguntur inter se trabes: the beams of
the building are fastened, and united by Nails one to another: so that the
Cornerstone does not only unite the foundation: but the Nails they unite the
roof.

Secondly, vasa suspensa pendent; upon the Nails all the Vessels hang, that is
the Metaphor used there; I will fasten him as a Nail in a sure place; and you
shall hang upon him all the glory of his Fathers house; the offspring, and the
issue; all the Vessels, even from cups to flaggons; all the necessary Utensils
of the house, they all hang upon this Nail: so then the meaning is this; That
out of Judah shall come forth a Magistrate, who shall be as a cornerstone to
support; to unite; to adorn the Commonwealth of Israel. And he shall be as a
Nail; he shall be for union above, as well as a Cornerstone below; and upon him
all the building of the Commonwealth shall hang, even from the highest to the
lowest; all sorts of Vessels, even from flaggons to cups.

Thirdly, Out of him shall come forth the Battle Bow; the Bow was an Instrument
of war, much in use in ancient times, and therefore is here put for all the
weapons of war all their ammunition for and all their discipline of war: now
the Lord had said before, Hos. 1.5. I will break the bow of Israel: and then
there should be no success in any of their undertakings there should not be any
instrument of war, nor any success in the use of them; and so that Zach. 9.10.
its said, the Battle-Bow should be cut off from Jerusalem; whereas formerly
they had no strength for war, but fell before their enemies continually, and
were given to them as a prey; it was the Lord had broken the battle-Bow, and
therefore they did hire in the neighbor Nations for to be their strength; and
sometimes they are found in the way of Egypt, sometimes of Assyria; but when
the Lord returns unto them in mercy for their deliverance, they should have
strength of their own against all the neighbor Nations; so that out of
themselves should come forth the Battle-Bow: and they should be successful in
war, and tread down their enemies as mire in the streets; because the Lord is
with them: So, that when the Lord did return to them in mercy, he would give
them power for, and success in war also.

Fourthly, Out of him every Oppressor, or Exactor, which I put both together,
(...) the word properly signifies an Exactor, or one that gathers taxes or
tribute of others, Isa. 60.17. I will make thy officers peace, and thy Exactors
righteousness: or else the word signifies to exact a man's work; as is used of
Pharoh, taskmasters, Exodus 3.7. I have heard their cry because of their
tack-masters: an Exactor of labor, and of tribute, are both fitly to be
understood here: for God does not only deliver his people from the power of the
enemy, but does also put the enemies into their power, so that they rule over
them: for, that is the promise, Isa. 14.2. They shall take them for servants
and for handmaids; they shall take them Captive, whose Captives they were: and
they shall rule over their Oppressors, Isa. 60.5,6. The Rulers of the Gentiles
shall come unto thee: the Dromedaries of Midian, and the gold of Shebnah: They
shall bring Gold and Incense. The sons of strangers shall build the walls;
their Kings shall minister unto thee: and the Nations that serve thee not shall
perish; so that they shall not only subdue their enemies, but rule over the
Nations: this shall be the glorious condition of the Church when the Lord shall
arise and have mercy on Sion: the fullness of which time is not yet come,
because the whole mystery of God is not yet finished: but it is Lactantius his
observation, Lactan.
de divin. praem. l. 7. cap. 19 Cadet repent gladius e coelo, ut sciant Justi,
ducem sanctae militiae descensurum. There is a great sword fallen from heaven
amongst all the Nations of Europe, yea even of all the world: which shall be a
signal to the Saints, that the Captain of the Lords host shall surely come unto
their full and perfect deliverance; and therefore they are to lift up their
heads, for their redemption draws nigh. Bellum saepe renovabit Antichristus,
and saepe vincet, donec consectis omnibus Impiis, debellatus: it is he has
drawn in all the wicked of the earth in his quarrel: But that is now the work
of the Lord that he is doing, making preparation for that great and last
battle, the battle Armageddon: and you will find a confederacy of all those of
the Popish Interest, and that have received the mark, either in the right hand
or in the forehead: and they shall some on one account, and some on another be
engaged, that they may perish together: and, then the Kingdoms and Dominions
under the whole earth, shall be given to the Saints of the most high: But that
is not until the fourth Beast be destroyed: The God of heaven shall set up a
Kingdom by it self, and after the destruction of the fourth monarchy: and
therefore that which now does hinder the setting up the Kingdom of God in the
world, shall be destroyed with an utter destruction. This I conceive to be the
meaning of the words.

You have then in these words the state of the people set forth after their
deliverance, what it shall be, and that is double.

Look upon them first in statu Politico: and afterward in statu Polemico.

First, in reference to their Politic state: so (says the Lord) they shall
never want a Governor, a (faithful Magistrate: but he shall be to them as the
Corner, and as the Nail: their enemies shall rule over them no more, the
Scepter shall no more depart from Judah: they shall have those of their own
that shall be able to uphold the Government, and unite the Commonwealth.

Secondly, look upon them in statu Polemico: so he says: Out of him shall go
forth the Battle-Bow: they shall have all sotts of warlike provisions in
themselves: and they shall be very successful in war: they shall tread down
their enemies, and they shall rule over their oppressors. These are the
promises that the Lord makes of a glorious estate unto his people after their
deliverance. But it is the first only that I am to speak to, as being only
proper for the present occasion: Out of him shall come forth the corner.

Doct.
The Observation that I shall deliver to you from thence is this; When the Lord
returns to his people in mercy, he will give unto them Governors that shall
support them: that shall be for the supporting, for the uniting, and for the
adorning of the Common wealth: I say, when the Lord returns to a people in
mercy, he will give unto them Governors that shall be for the support, the
uniting, and adorning of the Commonwealth. Here are but two things that the
time will give me leave to speak to; Therefore I shall omit the third.

I shall show you, that when the Lord returns to a people in mercy, he gives
them such Governors as support the Commonwealth; they shall be as the
Cornerstone upon which the weight of the building may lie.

Secondly, he does give them such Governors as shall be as the Corner stone,
that may unite the Commonwealth.

I shall begin with the first. First, good Magistrates are as the Cornerstone
to support the Commonwealth; it is true, all the stones in the building do
conduce to the upholding thereof; for as it is in the spiritual building, so it
is in the Politic, men are built as living stones; but I say, the main weight
of it lies upon the Cornerstone, because the weight of the building, the burden
of all lies upon the Magistrate; therefore I say, he is here resembled to a
Cornerstone. Now, that a Magistrates business is to uphold the Commonwealth,
take notice of these four denominations in the Scripture.

First, Magistrates are called the foundations of the earth, Psalm. 82.5. and
Mich. 6.2. where he speaks of the oppression of Magistrates, he says, all the
foundations of the earth are out of course: I have said ye are Gods: why? you
that are the foundations of the earth: to pull up Magistracy, is to pluck up
all by the foundation: (...) est quasi (...).

Secondly they are called the breath of your Nostrils, Lam. 4.20. the breath of
our Nostrils: it is spoken of Zedekiah who was an evil Prince, yet he has this
honorable title given him by the Prophet: it is as possible for a man to live
without breath, as it is for a Commonwealth to subsist without Magistracy.

Thirdly, they are called the shoulders upon which all the weight is born, Isa.
22. I will give him the key of the house of David: I will lay the key of the
house of David upon his shoulders: a key is Symbolum potestatis, an emblem of
Government: Now says the Lord, I will not put the key in his hand, but I will
lay it upon his shoulders, Isa. 9.6. Unto us a child is born; the Government is
upon his shoulder: Principes mundani onus gubernandi reji^iunt in humeros
servorum: it is but to let you see the weight of Government: therefore it must
be laid upon the shoulder, and men must lay their shoulders to it.

In the last place, Magistrates are called the Arms of the people; the Arms of
Moab are broken, Ier. 48.25. I am not able to bear this people alone, says
Moses: Moses had not Arms sufficient to bear such a weight. My beloved, the
great burden of all, I say, lies upon the Governors; they are the Arms by which
the people are born up. Unus tantum subditus in Civitate Magistratus est,
Luther.
says Luther: there was but one subject in a City, and that is the Magistrate:
the weight of all yes upon him And it must needs be so if you take his reason:
for he says, Ante peccatum Politia nulla fuit, politia est remedium
necessarium naturae corruptae: all civil Government was but a necessary remedy,
that was brought in for corrupt nature: Now if it be a remedy against corrupt
nature, the burdens of corrupt nature are exceeding many: in so much as the
Lord himself complains in Amos 2.13. I am pressed under your abominations as a
Cart that is full of Sheaves: therefore I say, the weight of all, the
supporting of all lies upon the Magistracy, they are the cornerstone upon whom
the weight of the building lies.

But the great enquiry will be: how are Magistrates the cornerstone of the
Commonwealth? how do they, or how must they support the Commonwealth, that
their duty may answer their dignity? that they may indeed prove corner-stones?
I shall give you five directions as briefly as I may.

First, that the Magistrate may be a cornerstone to support the building: he
must take care that he uphold Religion: that must be his first, that must be
his great care; that which should be mainly in our eye in praying for them,
should be chiefly in their eye in practicing, 1 Timothy 2.2. Pray for Kings, and
those that are in Authority, that you may lead a peaceable, and a quiet life in
godliness and honesty; peace without godliness, is but a vain, and a
mock-peace: but because now this is made a controversy, I shall offer three
considerations, which truly are to me unanswerable, that the Magistrate is to
take care of Religion: Nay, his great care, his first care is to be of that:
pray observe them well, because you are every where told now, Magistrates have
nothing to do with matters of Religion.

In the first place; every Magistrate ought to rule with God, Hosea 11. ver.
ult. Judah rules with God; the throne of the Magistrate is therefore called,
the throne of God. When Constantine was exalted to the seat of the Empire; it
is said, he was taken up into the throne of God, Rev. 12.5. then the great care
of Magistrates must be, that they do not rule alone: but that they have God to
rule with them: it is true, the most high rules in the Kingdoms of mortal men,
Dan. 4.17. but he rules but as he does rule in the Kingdom of the Devils; he
rules but by a way of providence; but you that fear God, should endeavor that
God should rule among you as he rules among his Saints, in ways of grace; in
ways of grace I say: Now I beseech you consider; let Religion be neglected or
corrupted, presently God forsakes that people. Look but into the 10. and 11.
Chapters of the prophecy of Ezekiel; it is true, the Lord does not remove all
at once: but the glory of the Lord goes up first from the Cherubims to the
threshold of the house, from the threshold of the house to the midst of the
City, and from ^he City to the Mountains; my Brethren, if the glory of God
leave your Ordinances once, be well assured, he will leave your City next; the
next move is that: therefore whatsover you do, if you would rule with God, take
heed that by this means he be not provoked to depart; for a Magistrate ruling
alone, and a Minister preaching alone is much alike: the one will never convert
a soul: and truly the other will never subdue a people: Nay mark what the Lord
says; to convert souls, and to subdue hearts is his work. David acknowledges
it, Psalm. 18.47. Thou art he that subdueth the people under me, says he; truly
if a man in his person neglect Religion, he lives without God in the world; and
if a Magistrate in his Government neglects Religion, he rules without God in
the world. That is the first argument: and I never expect to have it answered,
I look upon it as an unanswerable consideration.

The second is this, and pray mark it, for you had need endeavor to strengthen
your thoughts against such delusions as these are, that are everywhere
suggested: I wish it were not in men in high places. In the second place. A
Magistrate ought so to rule, as that God may not break in, in Judgment upon a
people: Pray mark it: you ought to rule so, as God may rule with you. Secondly,
you ought so to rule as that God may not in Judgment break in upon the people:
my beloved, you that are Magistrates, you are the shields of the earth, called
so, Psalm. 47. ult. the shields of the earth: Now consider, I humbly pray you: a
Shield is a defensive weapon, that the main protection of the people lies in:
you are not only to protect them from injuries among men, but you are to
protect them also from Judgments from God: and therefore when wrath goes out
from the Lord, Moses stands in the gap; when a plague is gone forth from the
Lord, David intercedeth: Hezekiah prays for the people: the Magistrate is to
be a Shield to them. But let the Magistrate in his Government neglect Religion:
what then? the Judgment of God breaks in upon the people immediately: look into
Ezekiel. 10.2. Go, says the Lord, take fire from between the Cherubims, and
scatter over the City: here is a fire now to burn the City; whence comes it?
out of what? Ordinances neglected; the fire is taken from between the
Cherubims, it is taken from off the Incense Altar: it will not only serve to
offer the sacrifices, but the same fire will serve to burn the City too; that
is a Scripture that I desire you much to observe, 2 Chronicles. 7.19,20. If you
forsake my statutes, and serve other Gods, says he; be negligent in matters of
Religion once: and what then? says the Lord, I will pluck you up by the roots
out of the Land that I have given you: there be some men now that think to root
you by the neglect of godliness, and to root you by the neglect of Religion;
this it not the way to establish you: no, consider, this is the way to pluck
you up by the roots, even your Commonwealth before it has scarce taken root.

In the third place, I beseech you consider: Magistrates ought so to rule as
they destroy not the foundations of their authority. You will say he is a
foolish man that pulls down his own house with his own hands: then certainly
Magistrates must so rule as that they destroy not the foundations of their own
Authority. My Beloved, if you uphold not Religion, you do so, Romans 13.5. you
must be subject, says the Apostle, not only for fear of wrath, but for
conscience sake: why all Divines give this as a rule, conscientia immediate Deo
tantum subsicitur: Conscience is subjected immediately to God only: then we are
to obey the Magistrates, only because it is an Ordinance of God: can any man
rationally imagine, that men will obey the Magistrate for conscience sake, who
is an Ordinance of God, and to be obeyed immediately, that neglects this
Ordinance of God in which this authority immediately is; can any man rationally
imagine, I say, that men will obey the Magistrate for God, that do not obey God
for himself? my Beloved, this is the way to destroy, and to pluck up by the
roots, I say, all authority: it destroies the foundation of all authority: it
is the most destructive opinion to Government that ever came into the world:
and yet notwithstanding, it is observable too, see how the Jesuits and some
others meet in this thing, though upon different grounds: Mariana he says,
Mariana.
Princeps nihil statuat de Religione; Princes and Magistrates have nothing to
do with matters of Religion, says he: why? because there he would establish
the authority of the Pope: now say some others; the Magistrate he has nothing
to do in matters of Religion, because though he will cry out against the Pope,
yet notwithstanding he will make himself one, he will take such a
licentiousness, that he will take to himself the Papal authority: thus I
entreat you then to Consider: this is the first thing wherein the Magistrate
should show himself the corner indeed, to support the Commonwealth, let him
uphold Religion. That is the first. I shall be more brief in the rest.

Secondly, the Magistrate is to be the corner to support the Commonwealth, in
upholding the Laws: the Laws are the foundations of the earth; they be so
called, Psa. 11.3. if the foundations be cast down, what can the righteous do?
the Laws are the foundations; it is a note of ignominy set upon Oppressors,
Dan. 7.25. that they labor to change times and Laws: they labor to change the
times and Laws: the Law is the Rule between the Subject and the Magistrate,
that the one may know how to rule, and the other know how to obey: it is the
standard between a man and his neighbor, by which all differences are to be
tried: therefore they that are in supreme authority, they ought to take special
care to observe the Laws: and they that are in subordinate authority, they
ought to take special care to execute the Laws; for this cause Magistrates they
ought to be well acquainted, make it their business to study the Laws by which
they are to rule; the truth is, my Beloved, a Magistrate without the Law, and a
Minister without the Bible, they are equal absurdities: a Magistrate unskilful
in the Law, and a Minister ignorant in the Scripture. Job says, I was an eye
to the blind, and feet to the lame, and a father to the poor; I diligently
searched out the cause, says he, Job 29.15: I diligently searched out the
cause; it may be he had more sense to complain, then he had skill to explain;
but I searched it out says he; he that shall do so, must be skilled in the
Laws; there are in ways of sin many cunning conveyances. David tells us, Psalm.
58.2. that there are men that weigh violence in the earth; that weigh violence,
that commit sin by measure; they know how far they may go, and yet how far they
incurr danger; by this means an unskilful Magistrate many times justifies the
guilty, and condemns the innocent: therefore its your duty I say, to preserve
the Laws: it is your duty to be well skilled in those Laws; this is certain, an
ignorant Ministry wrongeth many a soul, and an ignorant Magistracy undoeth
many a cause; Therefore that is the second. It would be very honorable unto
the Governors of this honorable and populous City that they would apply
themselves much these ways, that they may know the rules of their own
judgments, and not be acted barely by those that plead the cause; God will
judge by Law my Brethren, when he comes to judge; and so should you; he will
judge the secrets of all men according to my Gospel; he will not judge by
prerogative, he will judge by Law, Romans 2.16. That is the second; uphold the
Laws, and you uphold the Commonwealth.

Thirdly, Magistrates are to uphold their own authority, and in so doing they
uphold the Commonwealth: I say, you are to uphold your own authority: to what
purpose is the Legislative power, if there be not an executive power? the
Magistrate is to be the living Law; (...). If once the authority of God fall in
the heart of a man, the authority of his Law will quickly fall down: So if once
the authority of the Magistracy fall before men, truly the authority of the Law
executed by it will quickly come to nothing: therefore it should be your
business to uphold your own authority. In Prove. 20.8. it is said, that a wise
Ruler scatters the wicked with his eye. It is the Magistrates duty to uphold
their authority in the highest, to scatter the wicked with their eyes. There is
a generation of men that are enemies to authority, and they talk of Levelling
all every day: I desire that you would be pleased to consider, support your
authority in the execution of Laws; for if you cannot do that, if you cannot
support your own authority, you will hardly be able to support the Law, which
is in it self a dead letter: true indeed, it is no wonder that the men of
Belial should be willing to be sine jugo, without a yoke. It is said, 1 Samuel
10. there were Sons of Belial that brought him no presents; it is no wonder I
say: for consider seriously, this is that which comes to pass sometimes by the
Sons of men, and sometimes by the just Judgment of God. Zach. 11 ult. it is
said, the sword shall be upon the right hand of the Magistrate; his ruling
power shall be taken away, he shall have no authority, his authority shall come
to nothing, the sword shall be upon his right hand: my Beloved, if the Lord
engage your hearts to uphold holiness among you, there is nothing will strike
that awe into the hearts of offenders, of the proudest oppressors, as that
will, when Magistrates bear a double image, the image of God in them as men,
and the image of God upon them as Magistrates. Uphold your authority; that is
the third.

Fourthly, the Magistrate is to uphold the peoples liberty, and in so doing he
upholds the Commonwealth: uphold the peoples liberties: the liberties among the
Romans, were looked upon as sacred things, and of very high esteem, Acts 22.28
with a great price bought I this freedom: but I was freeborn, says Paul: your
liberties my Beloved, have cost much more then his could cost: what expense
both of treasure and blood? and therefore how great care, what great care
should the Magistrate take? those that are Custodes libertatis: it is your
honors to be Keepers of the Liberties of your City: it is your honor; aliud
est obedire, aliud servire: it is one thing to obey as a subject, it is another
thing to serve as a slave: therefore I say, the liberty of the people, that in
an especial manner should be preserved; you must draw them with the cords of a
man, drawn from Law and Love: or otherwise, whosoever he be that thinks to ride
a people as a Beast, that Beast will with the first opportunity cast his rider:
and this is the true reason why so many stars have fallen from heaven; this is
the true reason why you see at this very day so many Princes walking like
servants upon the earth; for surely that Authority which entrenches on the
peoples liberty, is not lasting; nullum violentum est perpetuum; its the
liberty of the people that equal Justice be toward all, and that all have
equal access to it: and that it be administered (...), without respect of
persons, or to servants, or friends: do not put a difference in the case, out
of partiality to any man: for all men should have the same interest in the
Magistrate as a Magistrate: and all particular respects in Judgments should be
put far away: the most upright and wary Magistrates may sometimes distribute
unevenly: for the Balances do seldom hang even, when some personal respects
are put into one end: Consider that I beseech you. That is the fourth
particular.

In the last place, and so I have done with this first Branch, (I am sorry the
time hastneth so.) The Magistrate must uphold the propriety of the people, and
in so doing he upholds the Commonwealth: he must uphold their propriety, that
every man may sit down under his own Vine, and under his own figg tree, Mica
4.4. That men may have something that they may call their own: not only their
own in reference to the Subjects, but their own in reference to the Magistrate:
for we are to consider, universa sunt in Regis imperio, non in patrimonio;
though you come under the Magistrates command, yet all is not the Magistrates
patrimony; he may not dispose of the subjects estates at his pleasure: it is a
dangerous thing when Magistrates prove Nimrods, mighty Hunters before God, when
they hunt many for the estates of the people: it was a sad complaint, Hab.
1.14. Lord, says he, why have thou made men like fishes of the Sea that have
no Ruler? where the great ones shall devour the less without control. These
are sad complaints when they come up before God: this is that that has buried
many a State in its own ashes, that the propriety of the people has not been
preserved; for Augustine complains of old, August.
that mundi regna, what were they says he, sed magna latrocinia, the
governments of the world what be they? why truly, but great Robberies. Now I
humbly desire you to consider: then is the Nation, then is a Commonwealth
supported, then do Magistrates prove the Corner, when the Liberties, when the
Religion, I say, the Law, the Authorities, the Liberties, the Proprieties of
the people are preserved: and remember the promise: and we may look out for the
time, in Ezekiel. 45.8. My Princes (says God) shall oppress my people no more: my
Princes they shall give unto their people their portion in my Land: says he,
they shall not take all to themselves, but they shall be contented with their
own portion: and they shall be contented that their Brethren shall take their
portion; My Princes shall oppress my people no more: Now, my Beloved, then shall
you that are Magistrates prove the cornerstone to a Nation, or to a Common
wealth, or to a Ci^y, when you do thus uphold them. And that is the first
thing: The Cornerstone, aedificium sustinet; it upholds the building.

I would speak something of the second, the Cornerstone aedificium continet,
it unites it: Magistrates are not only to sustain, and to uphold, but they are
to unite: Magistrates be called Healers, Isa. 3.7. they must bind up the wounds
of the people. The Lord Jesus Christ, it is his glory and work, (...), he does
unite them all under one Head: things in Heaven and things in earth, Ephesians.
2.20,21. in Adamo nos omnes uni sumus, Prosp. that as in the first Adam, so it
is true in the second Adam, it is in him they are made one and united: The
Corner stone is to unite as well as to support.

Oh, But you will say to me: It is union that we all long for: we are a divided
people; shall we always eat the flesh of our own arms? shall Ephraim be
against Manasseh, and Manasseh against Ephraim, and both against Judah still?
The staff of bonds is broken amongst us: shall it always remain broken? what
way is there that there might be a healing in this, that this breach might be
made up?

Why truly, the hand of the Ruler must be first in this thing, that the mercy
may be called by his name, the hand of the Ruler must be first in it: you that
are the Corner stones must unite the building: you talk of persuading the
people to unite; I say the hand of the Ruler must be first in the union.

I, but you will say: how can that be?

I beseech you, let me give you a few directions, and then I shall from all
make a short Application, and conclude. The ways of union are these five: and
I desire you that are in Authority to lay them to heart.

In the first place: Religion is the great bond of union: therefore I say, let
it be your great care that there be a unity in Religion; the greatest breach is
in that, Odia-religionum sunt accrbissima: no breach like that. You shall see
what began a breach between Israel and Judah: it was Religion upon a Politic
respect, when God rent the Kingdom from the house of Rehoboam; but observe, the
Politic difference might have been made up, and Jeroboam out of his Devilish
subtilty foresaw it, 1 King. 12.17. he says, if the people go up to Jerusalem
to worship, their hearts will turn again to the house of David, says he. The
Politic difference would have been made up: therefore says he, I will make
them two Calves, one in Dan, and the other in Bethel; and this shall set them
at a perpetual distance: the difference, the Politic difference might have
been made up, the State difference; but the difference in Religion would never:
therefore this was the way to divide them perpetually. If ever you will unite
the people, there must be your foundation: So the Lord begins when he will
unite his people, Zach. 14.9. Jehovah shall be one, and his name one: you shall
have but one God, and you shall worship him one way, by one name: Now you have
many Gods, and many names: Ichovah shall be one and his name one, Ier. 32.39. I
will give them one heart, and one way; one way: in what one way? in Religion,
that is the main thing he speaks of: or as the Prophet says, Zeph. 3.9. They
shall serve the Lord with one shoulder. I desire therefore, that no man would
take delight in keeping up differences in matters of Religion; take heed of it,
either upon this ground, because you look upon it as policy to uphold parties,
or else it may be, because you dare not displease either party: take heed of it
I say; be valiant for the truth upon earth: in this, contend earnestly for the
faith once given to the Saints: usually a girdle was an ornament belonging to
the Magistrates in former times: it is fit for those that are Rulers to wear it
still: have your loins girt about with truth, Ephesians. 6.14. Beloved, it is true, I
expect not that all men shall be of one mind, one judgment. I know men see
with different light: and I know, that while the smoke of the Temple lasts,
as it shall be during the pouring out of the Vials, Rev 15. I know the Sea of
glass will be mingled with fire: but in this you should be of one mind: you
must be in the fundamentals, that without which there can be no Religion, no
Christianity; he that speaks against these, opens his mouth wide against
Heaven. Neither say I, that the Magistrates judgment in this should be the
rule, as some men suggest, then you will have the Magistrates judgment to rule
in matters of Religion? No, we have a sure word of prophecy: and we know this
sure word of prophecy is not dark in that, in things necessary. The Apostle
tells us plainly, there is a pattern of wholesome words, to which we must keep:
(...) and though it is true, the grossest errors in the world would shroud
themselves under Scripture, and fly thither for a refuge: says Iustine
Martyr, Justine M^r.
(...) such a man expounds the Scripture secundum sensum non quem legit, sed
quem Attulit, August.
August. they would offer violence to the Scripture: they would fly thither
for refuge; but upon examination it would appear that the Scripture gives no
such shelter. Well, that is the first thing, if you would unite the great body,
unite in Religion; Let Ichovah be one, and his name one.

Secondly, if Magistrates would unite the people, then take heed: agree amongst
your selves, if you would have union amongst the people; I say, agree amongst
your selves: if the Corner-stones once fall asunder, you may easily expect many
cracks in the building: differences amongst Governors must needs cause strange
distractions among the people, for they are generally led by parties and
personal respects: therefore if you would heal this breach now which you all
seem to complain of, begin with your selves, Physician heal thy self: heal your
own differences first, all divisions amongst your selves; this is the way the
Lord takes in Hos. 1. ult. he says, they shall appoint to themselves one Head:
they should have many Governors united all under the Lord Jesus Christ, they
should be all under one head: I beseech you consider it: how comes it to pass
then, Governors in their Politic meetings meet with as great confusion, as
they did in their Church, Ecclesiastical meetings, 1 Cor. 14.26. how is it
(says the Apostle) that every one has a Psalm, and every one a Doctrine, and
every one has a Revelation, and every one has an Interpretation: let all be
done to edifying: every man did seek to show his gifts, and to lay out his own
parts, without all respect to the edification of the Church: So many times it
proves in Politic meetings too. It is good advice to Magistrates, though it
be given generally to Christians; My Brethren be not many masters, says the
Apostle, in Iam. 3.1. When a masterless disposition bears sway in Rulers, truly
then if their paths in every thing be not trodden, they are so far from being
Counselors, that they are themselves uncounsellable. My desire therefore to
you is this; that such Breaches amongst your selves may be made up, that
amongst you there may be none such, if it may be. But I should further desire,
that if any such be, you would with more wisdom keep them amongst your selves
then you do: if such differences and breaches, whatsoever they be amongst you
in counsels, come abroad, they cause great divisions amongst the people, and
great animosities in the hearts of the people, some one way, and some another,
as their party, or their fancy leads them.

In the third place labor for union amongst the Ministers; that should be one
thing that the Magistrate should take special care for: endeavor a union among
the Ministers of the Gospel: they will have still, and God would have them have
a great influence upon the people. If there be jarrs between Paul and Barnabas,
it is no wonder then, if one be for Paul, and another for Apollo: people
presently fall to parties: therefore I desire you to consider, in a special
manner, let it be your care that the Ministers be united: far be it that they
should be men to stir up strife: and that they should cause divisions, or
nourish them amongst the people: surely, it is your duty, Romans 14.19 to follow
after the things that make for peace; and those that will edify one another.
It is an observation that Bullinger has, Bullinger.
I remember in a Tract that he has written de persecutionibus Christianae
Ecclesiae, be says: that whenever the Church had peace, auctae sunt
dissentiones praecipue inter Episcopos and Doctores quibus populus nihil
aedificabatur: by and by there arose differences amongst the Ministers, and by
this means the people were not edified but destracted: and what then? then the
Lord gave them to such a persecution, and then to such a persecution, ad
abstergendam aeruginem: and those of us now that cannot pray together, nor give
thanks together; no, by no means, we can neither pray for the same mercy, nor
give thanks for the same deliverances: truly then we may go together in the
same prison, and it may be die at the same stake; far be it therefore from the
Minister of the Gospel, I say, that they should cause division or uphold it:
but if such a thing be, it was Nazianzens last request to the Emperor before
he left the Court, Nazianz.
that he would use all the Authority he had to reconcile the Ministers, (...),
Cause that dissension, cause that war to cease.

Oh, But you will say, how is it possible we should do it, how can it be?

Truly, the Apostle has a Rule, if it were we I understood, and as well
practiced, would reach very far in it: you have it in 1 Cor. 14.32. the Spirit
of the Prophets is subject to the Prophets: the Spirit of the Prophets is
subject to the Prophets: the Spirit of the Prophets, that is, the Doctrine
which they did profess to speak by the Spirit, this Doctrine is subject to the
Prophets; how? prophetarum censuris, to their examination, and to their
censure; they were to try it by the rule of the word, whether it were the word
of God or no; Now, if the Spirit of the Prophets be subject to the Prophets,
then certainly if men were to undergo such a trial of Doctrine, they would not
be so ventrous both in the Press and in the Pulpit, as now every where they
are; but it is for want of this rule not being observed, the spirit of the
Prophets is subject to the Prophets. That is the third direction. Reconcile the
Ministers, and you will unite the Nation.

In the fourth place. I will but add a word of the rest. Take away all
oppression, and all partiality in judgment; there will never be a union till
then; while there is oppression there will be division: it is a sure rule; Ubi
desinit judicium, ibi incipit bellum; war begins where judgment ends: a sure
rule; hold the reins of Government with an even hand: I say do not hold them
strait upon some, and loose off upon others: for if you do, there will be a
heart-division that will arise: take but that Scripture (but mark) it is a
notable Scripture, Job 34.17. Shall be that hates right Govern? says he: the
word is (...) shall he that hates right bind up? so it is in the Original,
shall he that hates right bind up? truly that man that does not administer
judgment righteously in his Government, that man will never bind up the
breaches of a Nation: he that hates right will never bind up the sore.

In the last place: pray for this mercy, you that are Magistrates, pray for it:
it is not only your duty to rule the people, but to pray for them. Hezekiah
prayed for the people; and you find upon every occasion, Moses his hands were
up: and Samuel says, God forbid I should cease to pray for you, says he. And
God has promised to hear the prayers of the Magistrates in an especial manner;
you pray ex osficio; you pray as men in office: their prayers are more then the
prayers of any private and particular man, if they be godly. Consider, I humbly
beseech you: as it is in Church Officers, James 5.14, 15. says the Apostle, If
any man be sick, let him send for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray
over him: why not for the Brethren as well as for the Elders? The Lord has
special respect to men in office: and in an especial manner let your prayers be
by strength of arguments of faith drawn from those great promises, I will give
them one heart, and one way: the two sticks shall become one in my hand: and by
this means the Lord may make you the healers of the breach: the Cornerstone to
unite, as well as to uphold the people. This is the dignity and this is the
duty of Magistrates, that as Cornerstones they uphold the building; and that as
Cornerstones they unite the building.

Now I have a word of Application suitable to the present occasion, and I have
done. The Use that I shall make of it is unto you, my Beloved, that are to vote
in this Election: it is a great trust that the Lord has committed to you: the
good, and the public welfare of this great, rich, and populous City: I say it
is a great trust that the Lord has committed to you. You are now to make choice
of a Cornerstone, to rest the weight of the building upon; a Cornerstone in
whom the several parts of the building be united. You see what manner of person
he ought to be. You see what the office is to which he is called. I shall now
in the Apostles words give you a charge before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ,
who shall judge quick and dead at his appearing, and in his Kingdom, that you
do this without partiality, without respect of persons: making choice of such a
one, of such persons as may be fit, and best suitable in your consciences unto
those great ends that have been named, to support and unite the building.

I, but you will say, What manner of persons must they be, what manner of men
must they be now that will be fit for this great work?

Truly, I shall but make choice barely of that direction laid clearly down,
Exodus 18.21. the common rule for Magistrates which I shall briefly offer to
your consideration, and conclude. They were to choose Governors under Moses,
because he could not bear the people alone: now says he, choose you able men,
fearing God; men of truth, hating covetousness: mark ye: First, I say, make
choice of men fearing God; have not respect to riches so much, or to seniority
so much, where there is not piety: Let that be the great thing you have in your
eye: For I beseech you consider, they that have not given themselves unto God,
they will never govern for God; they will never give up themselves to the
public good, who have not in that great work of Regeneration denied
themselves; they can never do it: and therefore I say, it is the greatest wrong
you could do such a man to choose him to an eminent place: for what do you do?
You do but put into his hands a far greater occasion, an opportunity of
sinning. Besides (I beseech you consider) if they have not the fear of of God
in their hearts, they will not have the presence of God in their Government: I
say, if they have not the fear of God in their hearts, they will not have the
presence of God in their Government: and surely they will never rule well, that
rule without God: in stead of being a Corner to support the Commonwealth,
truly they will be a means to destroy it. Therefore that is the first thing;
have respect unto godliness; let them be men fearing God; those that have first
given themselves to God, and then when they have given themselves to Gods
service, they will give themselves to yours: but never else.

Secondly, The second direction that is there given, is, they must be men of
courage; able men, you read it; it is (...) in the Original, it signifies
strength either of body or mind; they must be men of stout and resolute
Spirits. Magistrates meet many times with matters of great difficulty:
sometimes they be ill looked upon by them that are above them: sometimes they
are ill spoken of by them that are below them. Now I say, this will require a
stoutness, and resolution of spirit, that a man shall not flatter the one, nor
he shall not strive to please the other, but go on in his duty, and not turn
aside neither to the right nor to the left hand. I told you, Magistrates are
called the Shields of the earth; a Shield is a venterous weapon, receives all
the Darts: and I say he had need be a stout-spirited man that must undertake
such an employment: he must be a man of courage, that he may not for fear of
them above him, nor that he may please them below him, he may not step by, or
beyond his duty. He may despise the murmurs of the multitude, and he man say,
Been facere and male audire, regium est, Seneca.
Seneca. It is the property indeed of a noble Spirit: for if you should choose
now a weakhearted man, one that is not able to encounter with difficulties, but
is afraid of the appearance of every danger, when any opposition presents it
self, his heart fails, and he will be ready to turn with every wind; you have
seen woeful experience thereof: therefore I say, the next thing, as to be a man
fearing God, so in the next place, let him be a man of courage, a man of
strength and resolution of Spirit.

In the third place; let him be a man of truth: choose men of truth: that is,
not only men that love the truths of God, and are valiant for the truth upon
earth in that respect, but men that love truth in judgment: men that love to
execute true judgment, as the expression is. My Beloved, a false Judgment is
a lie to Authority, and therefore the greater transgression: I say a wrong
Judgment is a lie to Authority, and therefore the greater transgression: there
is a great deal of Art not only in sinning, but in concealing, Micah 7.3. So
they wrap it up; sometimes the forgery of a witness; sometimes the subtilty of
a pleader, there is a mist cast before the eye of the Magistrate: and truly by
this means many times wrong judgment proceeds from him: which now if he be
not a man that loves truth, he will never be diligent to search out the cause;
and therefore that is the third thing: Choose men of Truth.

And then in the last place, Let them be men hating covetousness: hating
covetousness; not only he must not be a covetous man, but must be a man that
hates covetousness: Certainly my Beloved, that man that is greedy of gain,
will transgress for a morsel of bread; the poorest circumstances will turn this
man out of the way of Judgment; a gift blinds the eyes, Deuteronomy. 16.19. truly,
the man cannot see with his own eyes, he cannot see with the eyes of the Law,
nor he cannot pronounce the Sentence of the Law: surely men will never take
care for the public profit, so long as their eyes are set upon their own
private gain; it was an old observation of Salvian: Salvian.
Dives potestas pauperem facit Rempublicam; a rich Magistrate commonly makes a
poor Commonwealth; who make it their business to serve themselves upon it.
Therefore in an especial manner these are the directions I give you, and I lay
it upon your consciences in the name of the Lord, that you make choice of such
a one, and that will serve for those high and glorious ends that has been
mentioned to us, to support and to unite the building: by this means (my
Beloved) the Lord shall be with them, and with you in their Government: and by
this means, your City shall be called a City of righteousness, a faithful City.
And so much now shall serve for the opening to you this first branch of the
Text, how to support, and unite. Let us look up to God for a blessing.

Perfect CLEANSING.
2 COR. 7.1. Having therefore these Promises (dearly Beloved) let us cleanse
our selves from all filthyness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in
the fear of God.


THE Apostle having in the former Chapter exhorted the believing Corinthians to
abstain from all Communion and fellowship with Idolaters: and having pressed
the Exhortation with diverse Arguments, he comes at last to mention those
exceeding great and precious promises, of which by their holy calling they did
partake in, ver. 16.17,18. having therefore these, he exhorts them to look upon
them either as me^ of holiness, or as motives to perfecting holiness (...) the
fear of God. First, as means of holiness; the whole word of God is operative,
and does produce real effects: I speak the word says Christ; but my Father in
heaven does the works, Ioh. 14.10. therefore not a word spoken, but the word
written, Heb. 3.8,9. leaving upon the soul answerable dispositions, not barely
an informing, but a transforming word, 2 Cor. 3.13. a word ingrafted: the
change of the stock into its own nature: not a transient, James 1.21. but an
abiding word, 1 Pet. 1.25. if you receive these promises aright, they will thus
make you partakers of the Divine Nature, 2 Pet. 4.4.

Holiness here, as Cameron has interpreted, Cameron.
ad modum creaturae, etc. in blessedness hereafter, having such promises that
will transform you, Matthew. 11.5. the blind receive their sight, etc. and the
Gospel is preached to the poor: (...), the poor are Evangelized: that is both
to the poor is the Gospelpreached, and the poor receive the Gospel, and be
transformed thereinto, the poor are Evangelized; therefore cleanse your selves,
perfecting holiness.

Secondly, As motives to holiness, and that considered three ways: either,
First, As an honor put upon a man; and dignity should engage a man to duty:
monstrosa res est gradus summus, and animus Infimus: Nehem. 6.11. Dan. 4.17.
therefore having such promises, let us cleanse our selves, and stand upon our
dignity, as they did. Secondly, as an assurance that whatsoever God promised
he will also accomplish; for omne promissum cadit in debitum; therefore, Matthew.
10.7. it is said there, he will perform his truth to Jacob, and his mercy to
Abraham: The promises (it is true) their ground is now in fieri: but it is
truth in facto ^sse: surely therefore faithful is he that has promised and
will also do it. Having therefore such promises, let us cleanse our selves,
etc. Thirdly, as rewards; for so it is true, most of the promises are rewards
for services going before: and as the Lord in his punishments does usually
punish sin with sin: so in the ways of mercy he does usually reward grace with
grace: to him that has shall given: for recte fecisse merce est; and knowing
that a godly man desires no greater reward, but even that which comes in
keeping the Commandment: and the Lord does proportion the reward unto the work:
he will reward every one according to the works here: For as hereafter in
glory, so he does it in the life that now is: answerable to a man's service in
reference to the promises, such shall the reward from the promise be: For he
will not forget any of the works and labor of Love, it shall not be in vain in
the Lord. Having therefore such promises, let us cleanse our selves, etc.

Here then is first a duty pressed, which is perfect sanctification, which
consists of two parts. 1. Perfect cleansing. 2. Perfect holiness.

Secondly, here is the means and motive unto both; sanctifying truths, Having
such promises; secondly; sanctifying graces; in the fear of God.

The Observations that might be gathered are diverse, as;

Observe. 1. First, Sin is filthyness; that is, First it includes in it all
loathsome evil; there is malum turpe, as well as malum triste. Secondly, it is
so in its essence, for it is in the abstract: and abstractum denot at essentiam.

Observe. 2. Secondly, it is an universal defilement both of life and spirit: it
is an over-spreading leprosy, so that men have not only fleshly members, but
also fleshly minds, 2 Col 18. Vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind.

Observe. 3. Thirdly, this universal defilement remains in a great measure, even
in those that have believed through grace; they must cleanse themselves also;
they have not already attained, neither are they also perfect, Phil. 3.12. the
Apostle says, Not as though I had already attained, neither was already
perfect, etc. But I shall pass these by, and pitch only on those things which
the Apostle does in these words mainly intend: which is to press them to
perfect sanctification, having promises made unto them of the great perfection:
the Doctrine which we shall therefore speak is this.

Doctrine.
As perfect holiness hereafter shall be the Christians Crown, so striving to
perfection here is the Christians duty: perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

Here I will show you two things. First, what holiness is: Secondly, what
perfection of holiness is, and so come to prove this point. First, to begin
with the first: What holiness is? The holiness of God being absolute and
independent as all his other Excellencies are, cannot as I conceive consist in
relation, but must be an absolute and positive thing: which I conceive to be
nothing else but the purity of the divine nature: but now holiness in the
creature being a dependent excellency, having its principle from another, and
its pattern in another, that is in God, and in the Law: it must consist in
conformity unto another, as the truth and goodness of the creature does: so
that the holiness of the creature is nothing else but a conformity of the
creature unto the purity of God, manifested in his Law. I do not say the
holiness of God as in himself, but the holiness of God as in the Law: in
conformity whereto the holiness of the creature does consist. Before the fall,
the holiness required was only positive, consisting in a conformity to the duty
commanded: but since sin, there must be a cleansing from the sins forbid: it
was before only a conformity to the precept, but since it is a conformity to
the holiness of God in the prohibition also: so that as in the Justification of
a sinner, there is more required then was required to justify the Angels, or
Adam in innocence; not only a doing the duty, but a suffering the curse: so in
the sanctification of a sinner also, there is more required to make us holy,
then there was to make Adam holy: It is not now barely a creation of the new
man; but also a mortification of the old, and a destroying of the body of sin;
not only sanctification and dedication to what is holy, but a purification and
separation from what is unclean: therefore here the Apostle sets down both
parts of holiness; purification and dedication, a cleansing of a man's self from
all filthyness, and then a perfecting holiness in the fear of God. Secondly,
the perfection of holiness therefore consists in three things. 1. Perfectio
gradus; when corruption is perfectly cleansed, and all filthiness, and in all
degrees, and in all faculties, both of the flesh and of the spirit. 2.
Perfectio essentin: when grace has attained its full pitch unto which it is
appointed; the measure of the age of the stature of Christ's fullness to all
might in every grace and every faculty. 3. Perfectio operationis: when those
perfect graces have their perfect works as the Apostle speaks, James 1.4. Let
patience have its perfect work; that you may be perfect and entire, wanting
nothing: so that the point has in it those three branches.

First, perfect purification, which shall be hereafter our glory is in this
life our duty: in that every one that is an heir of the promise, is to purge
himself from all filthyness: and this perfection of purification consists in
three particulars. First, in being purged from all kinds of sin, all
filthiness, Col. 3.5. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth
fornication, uncleanness, etc. Now the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the
eye, or the pride of life, can be dispensed with; neither sins of ignorance, or
sins of knowlede; sins of omission, or sins of commission; neither in thought,
word or deed: nay it shall rise so high, that a man should strive not only that
sin might not rise, but that sin might not be; answerable to that prayer of the
Apostle, I pray God that you do no evil, 2 Cor. 13.7. When a man's labor in
purging holds correspondency with the purity of the Law: and is of equal
latitude: thy Law says David, is very pure, thy Commandment is exceeding
broad, Psalm. 19.40. and v. 96. when a man has an inward principle of purity
answerable to the exact purity of the Law, and as broad as the Law, that a man
hates every false way: I was also upright before him, and I kept my self from
mine iniquity: because it is the stumbling block of their iniquity, Psalm.
19.28. Psalm. 18.23. Ezekiel. 7.19. Secondly, from all degrees of those kinds of
sin: so to be cleansed, as that he may be presented not having spot or wrinkle,
or any such thing, but that he may be holy and without blemish, Ephesians. 5.26,27.
when a man does strive, (...), not only to purge, but to pull out the old
Leaven, that a man may be in all things a new lump, 1 Cor. 5.7. and this is
required not only that a man should not lie in wickedness as the word does, 1 John 5.19. that is to be wholly in the power of the wicked one, as that phrase,
(...), does import: but also that a man keep himself unspotted of the world;
not a spot of sin shall be upon him: sin shall not seize on him in any degeee,
James 1.27. he keeps himself unspotted from the world. Ephesians 5.3. but
fornication, uncleanness and covetousness, let it not be once named among you
as becomes Saints. And see how a godly man is described in reference to the
least defilement of sin, Isa. 33.15. he despises the gain of oppression, he
shakes his hands from holding bribes, and stops his ears from hearing
blood, and shuts his eyes from seeing evil; he keeps himself that the wicked
one touches him not; 1 Ioh. 5.18. he may, tactu simplici: and so he did Adam,
and so Christ also, and a man cannot avoid it; but not tactu qualitativo, as a
lodestone touches a knife to leave an impression of its nature, to enable it
to draw iron: as it does to leave an impression of the same evil and
devilishness that is in him: so he that is born of God, keeps himself that
the wicked one touches him not. Thirdly, and that in the whole man, when a
man's purging reaches to all filthyness of the flesh and spirit, when a man
makes it his business to have his heart cleansed as well as his hands, James
5.8. hate a corrupt mind as well as an unclean conversation: the wills of the
fle^h, as well as the lusts of the flesh: to have a man's conscience purged from
dead works, as well as his ways, Heb. 9.14. And put off the old man together
with his deeds. Col. 3.9. When a man puts off all his filthy garments; will not
leave a rag behind upon any part, Zach. 3.4. when a man's care is that his
Spirit and soul, as well as his body, may be preserved blameless unto the
coming of the Lord Jesus, 1 These. 5.23. this is the perfection of purification,
and we see it enjoined in all these particulars; and he that strives unto this,
he does purify himself, even as God is pure, 1 John 3.3.

Reasons.
Now the reasons of the point, to mention some of many that might be brought.

First, because of the filthyness and spreading nature of all sin. 1. Because
of its filthy nature, it is an open Sepulcher, and the stink thereof, Romans
3.13. Ezekiel. 24.11. it is ascum, it is a vomit. 2 Pet. 2.20. it is dung: Nay to
express it to the highest, it is, (...), the very excrements of naughtiness; so
that if there could be any thing worse and more filthy then naughtiness it
self, that is sin: Iam. 1.21. Wherefore lay apart all filthyness and
superfluity of naughtiness, etc. What ever is loathsome in the world, it is all
too little to give names to sin: and if sin be so in it self, if filthyness in
its essence, then all the parts of it is filthyness: and though there be but
the remainders of sin in the godly, yet this is their nature; for every spark
is of the same nature with the sire: and every drop with the water, because it
is corpus homogeneum, so is the body of sin also. Secondly, and it is not more
filthy then it is spreading: therefore it is rottenness, Isa. 1.6. from the
sole of the foot to the head, there is no soundness in it; it is a leprosy, a
gangrene, 2 Timothy 3.8. it is the plague: the most infectious disease, 1 King.
8.38. it is a poison, Romans 3.13. and therefore so long as any remains, so long
there will be a continual infection: if a man has but one lust in his soul,
this will speedily conceive and bring forth all sin: for the birth of sin is
monstrous, it will not only bring forth lusts after its kind, but lusts of
diverse, nay of a contrary kind, covetousness is the root of all evil, 1 Timothy
6.10. if there were but that one lust in the soul, all sins would grow out of
it, even its contrary corruptions.

Secondly, Because Christ has perfectly bought off all sin, in every kind and
degree, and he is as well a fountain for the filthiness of sin to wash it,
Zach. 13.1. as a Sea for the guilt of sin to drown it, Mich. 7.19. And to this
end, he gave himself that thou might be without spot or wrinkle, or any such
thing, Ephesians. 5.25,27. And should not a man strive to have all the price out of
the blood of Christ? consider the perfect cleansing was the price of blood: it
is a great undervaluing of the blood of Christ, and not the least pitch of
profaneness, not to seek after that which our high Priest has purchased at so
dear a rate; should it not grieve man to see lust possessing that which he so
dearly bought? Impius has segetes? Nay let the Spirit of Christ come and take a
full possession of what he has purchased. I might mention diverse other reasons
which will be brought in to the answering of this Objection.

Objection. This is to put men upon seeking impossibilities, which was never
promised, never attained, but as we know in part, and prophecy in part, so our
grace is but in part, and our purification in a measure: Who can say, I have
made my heart clean? I am pure from my sin? Nay the best men have those sores
running upon them, and therefore have need of the balm of Gilead: the best are
clad with filthy Garments: and need that the Lord should say, Take away the
filthy Garments, and I will cloth you with change of raiment, as in Zach.
3.4,5.

Answer. First, perfect purity is commanded both in nature and life: the Law
condemns each uncleanness with a curse To him that continues not in all things,
Gal. 3.10. which are written in the book of the Law to do them; neither did
Christ come to abolish the Law; but a justified person is as strictly bound to
the Law for duty as Adam was, though not with such evil consequences: he is
bound under danger of contracting sin, though not under danger of concurring
death: he that came to redeem men from sin, did never come to privilege men to
commit sin: he that was made a curse for sin, never came to be a cloak for sin:
therefore, Mat. 5.18. Christ says, not a title of the Law shall pass. One
observes, that the expression notes Absolutissimum legis complementum: the Jews
superstitiously conceived, that there were strange mysteries in every point and
prick in the letter of the Law: Christ says, I am so far from destroying the
Law in regard of duty, that if the smallest letter, and the least tittle of the
Law had such hidden mysteries in it as you teach and conceit, yet every such
title, and the mysteries therein shall be fulfilled and perfectly accomplished:
for this perfect purity we had in Adam, Eccl. 7.29. God made man upright, but
he sought out many inventions; our inability to obey, does not take away Gods
authority to command: and therefore he requires not the same duty only, but the
same power. Luke 10.27. Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy might:
that is not, thou shall love him with all the strength thou have: and thou
shall resist sin withal the strength thou have: but with all the strength that
I have given thee, and which thou wast to have: so that the ability comes under
the commandment, as well as the duty; and therefore want of ability to resist
sin perfectly, is both thy sin and thy punishment. Secondly, Because God has
commanded absolute perfection, to be perfectly freed from sin: therefore the
godly have prayed for it: Christ taught them so to do, Matthew. 6.13. And deliver
us from evil. And Paul, 2 Cor. 13.7. I pray God that you do no evil. Heb.
13.21. The God of peace make you perfect in every good work to do his will; the
God of peace sanctify you throughout; and I pray God that your whole spirit,
soul and body, may be kept blameless, etc. 1 These. 5.23. for I conceive, that
the whole will of God is the ground of prayer, if we ask any thing according to
his will, he hears us, Joh. 5.14. therefore the precept is as well as the
promise; only the precept requires perfection, because it is the rule of
obedience required under the first Covenant, though not made subservient to the
second: but the promise is not of perfection here, because it answers only to
the grace which the Lord intends to bestow in the second Covenant. I know that
these prayers of the Saints were never fulfilled here, but the best men have
departed hence have souls imperfect, much wanting of this purification:
perfection is reserved for time to come, Heb. 12.23. And to the spirits of just
men made perfect, that is only in heaven: yet such prayers and endeavors be
not vain, and all such strivings after perfection is not to no purpose. First,
because here a man manifests his displeasure against sin, and his love to the
Commandment: and though he has brought upon himself a miserable necessity of
sinning, yet notwithstanding the evil that he does he hates, and therefore
cries out, Oh miserable man: Who shall deliver me from this body of death? Romans
7.15.24. Secondly, hereby a man manifests the abundant sincerity of his heart
toward the Lord Christ: That he would not only not have sin to reign, but also
that it should not be; that not only his ways, but his nature also should be
conformable to the Law in all things: and not only that Christ should rule, but
also that he should rule in him without resistance and control: he would not
have the Kingdom of Christ amongst his enemies here, but over his enemies: that
every thing might be brought into subjection, 2 Cor. 10.5. That he might tread
every enemy under foot, 1 Cor. 15.25. Thirdly, hereby a man does his duty in
striving to perfection, Phil. 3.12. Work out your salvation Phil. 2.12. (...),
rem rudem and informem expolire: and so by doing his duty he makes his heart
perfect with the Law, even in the imperfection of his obedience: for the Lord
accepts the will for the deed: the duty belongs to us, the success to God: and
he takes it exceeding kindly that men should be willing, not only to, but,
beyond their power, 2 Cor. 8.3. Abraham did his duty in praying for Ismael, and
the Lord did graciously manifest the acceptance of his person and prayer, when
he did deny the particular request he asked of him. Fourthly, Though such
prayers and endeavors be not answered in perfection, yet they shall be
answered in degrees; and if God add but a further degree, it is not lost; for
Gods usual manner is to make one mercy to his people an answer to a former
prayer, and an encouragement to beg a further mercy: and it is not in vain if
God in any degree give a man his hearts desire, and do not deny him the request
of his lips, Psalm. 22.2,3. for as formerly Prophesies were truly fulfilled,
though by degrees: so prayers and endeavors are truly answered, though but by
degrees, yet so as still an answer in a degree is a sure pledge that God will
in his due time fulfill all our petitions. Fifthly, those prayers and endeavors
are not lost, which are for things not to be accomplished in this life: for as
Christ's righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, because it is offered
unto God by an eternal Spirit, Heb. 9.14. so I conceive the prayers of the
Saints being sacrifices unto God, because they be offered with public
intentions, and by a public and eternal spirit, are eternally accepted, and of
an everlasting efficacy, though after a man's death to be accomplished in this
world, or in that which is to come. David puts up a prayer by the spirit
against Judas, Psalm. 69.8,9. and it took effect upon him many hundred years
after he was dead, and had seen corruption. God has promised to bring forth
Judgment to victory, and to present you without spot or wrinkle: your prayers
and endeavors; for this shall add to your glory: and these promises shall be
accomplished in the Lords time: and then your names shall be recorded in those
mercies, as those that were co-workers with God, and preparing your own glory
here for hereafter: and then you shall rejoice in them not only as Gods
mercies, but also as an answer to your prayers: all the prayers of the godly
are not for present fruit, yet so as they bring a harvest many years after; and
then when it comes, a man has the sweetness of the mercy, and the answer of
the prayer, all come in together: if the Spirit that indites prayers does so
here in this life, how will it do hereafter when he shall dwell in a man for
ever without grievance? how will a man's joy be great, when his joy shall be as
the joy of harvest? oh how full will a man's joy be then!

V^
Let it therefore stir us up to the practice of this duty, which is here
exhorted, and that is perfect cleansing: And now to awaken us to it the more, I
will give some Rules by which men may judge, that they have great need of this
exhortation, and that the work of cleansing is very imperfect in them: Consider
these six particulars.

First, To sin much against knowledge, is an argument of a very unclean spirit,
whether it be against principles, as Romans 1. ult. Who knowing the Judgment of
God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the
same, but have pleasure in them that do them: or against repeated admonitions,
as Judas and Pilate did: or against the secret instructions of a man's own
conscience, the chastisement of his reins, as Darius and Herod did against John
the Baptist, Mark. 6.22. or against truths professed, as Saul against Witches:
and truths glorified in us; the Apostle says, Thou art called a Jew, and
make thy boast of God, and gloriest in the Law; through breaking the Law
dishonourest thou God?

Secondly, The more speedily lust takes away the man, the more unclean that man
is; therefore the expression is, A man soon angry, Prove. 14 17. A man of a
hasty spirit, Eccl. 7.9. but on the other side, a man of understanding, that
is, a holy mortified man, is of a cold spirit: so that though the fire of
corruption blown long by Satan may kindle at last, yet it does not speedily,
because he has a cold spirit, not a Gunpowder disposition unto evil, Prove.
7.22. as soon as the harlot made the motion, it is said, he went after her
strait-way: or immediately without any more ado, etc. And as it argues a heart
the more perfectly sanctified, when it is sitted for a very good work, Tit. 3.1
for any honorable use; so it argues a heart more exceedingly unclean when it
is fited to be used by Satan in any evil work, when the heart is prepared as an
Oven fit for any Batch, Hos. 7.6. fit to be led captive at the will of Satan, 2 Timothy 2.26. And the truth is, that makes a man stubble to judgment, because he
has been stubble to sin first: and therefore lust in a man's heart is not only
compared to fire amongst men that must be fed with fuel, and so it sooner
burns: but it is a fire that feeds it self without fuel, and therefore called
the fire of hell, James 3.6.

Thirdly, the more sin passes through the whole man without control, the more
unclean the heart is; as in the performance of duty, the more the soul is
subdued to the duty, and every thought brought into subjection, 2 Cor. 10.2.
the more sanctified it is: so on the contrary, the more the heart is subdued by
a lust, and the less resistance it finds, Jude 11. (...) v. So Ezekiel. 16.36. Thy
filthyness was poured out to all thy Lovers: when shame which is a doom to some
men's lusts prevails not: when checks of conscience, thoughts of death and
Judgment, keep not men's lusts from overflowing, 2 Pet. 3.4. it shows a heart
exceedingly defiled.

Fourthly, the more unsatiable men's desires are in the commission of any sin,
the more unclean the man is: Hab. 2.5,6. Nebuchadnezar for his covetousness is
compared to a Drunkard for his unsatiableness; for none call faster for wine
usually then they that have had too much before: it is with greediness. Ephesians.
4.19. who being past feeling have given themselves over to work all
uncleanness, 1 Pet. 4.4. with greediness, excess of riot, wherein they think it
strange that you run not with them to the same excess of riot. Isa. 5.14. As
the grave, and as hell they weary themselves, Ierem. 9.5 the members are weary
in obeying, when the Law of the members is never weary exacting: Balaams lust
was too swift for the very beast, and men's lusts are often too vast for their
weakened and tired ability to act them: therefore they load themselves with
thick clay, Hab. 2.4,5. enough to load them, but not to satisfy them.

Fifthly, the more provision a man makes for lusts before, and the more plots
he has going to accomplish his lusts, the more unclean that man is, Romans
13.14. As Judas sought opportunity to betray Christ, Mat. 26.16. And some do
provide themselves of nets and draggs before hand to catch men, as Hab. 1.16.
Hos. 7.5. and 6.7. They have made ready their heart as an Oven: it is conceived
to be spoken of the Princes of Israel under some Idolatrous King: the hearts of
the Princes and the Counselors were ready as an Oven: they had prepared
themselves to receive and bring in any wickedness, or any Idolatry, and they
were ready to bring the people into it, and they had their Agents went about to
leaven the people that were not all of that mind: presently, in the mean time
it is said, the saker, the King some say, or else they that had the special
hand in this, he sleeps not at night, but he observes how the plots take, and
where the lump is leavened, and the people prepared to entertain the
innovations that he did intend to bring in, and if they miss an opportunity of
sinning they be sorry for it, 2 King. 5.20.

Sixthly, and lastly, The more lust does disturb a man in holy duties: it did
show indeed that Elyes sons were sons of Belial, that lay with the women at the
door of the Tabernacle, 1 Samuel 2.22. It argued that Zimry was desperately set
upon evil, when in a day of humiliation he durst bring a woman where all the
Congregation were humbling themselves before the Lord. So for a man to lead a
lust through the whole soul in the special presence of God in his Ordinances,
shows a very unclean spirit; if the heart of the people go after covetousness
when they are hearing, Ezekiel. 33.31. and after vain glory in prayer, Mat. 6.5.
for if ever grace have the advantage, it is then when a man stands before the
Lord; and that sin bear it down at best duties, it argues that lust is
exceeding powerful in a man, and he is exceedingly unclean.

Now for some rules to judge of the perfection of this work, how a man comes
nearer to it, take these five.

First, The more clearly a man discerns, and the more fully his heart is
affected with spiritual sins, the more clearly he can discern them: for as all
sins proceed from darkness so every sin increases darkness: the more unclean
any man is, the more blind he is: therefore Paul could not only see Satan's
pitched battles against him, but (...); 2 Cor. 2 11. the stratagems and
ambushes that he used: not only the temptation: it self, but Satan's plots and
purposes in tempting: the depths of Satan, Rev. 2.24. And the more he is
affected with them, the more bitterly he does condemn them, and mourn for them,
as David for his base dejection, Psalm. 42.11. his carnal confidence in the
creature, Psalm. 30.6,7. his secret grudging at the prosperity of the wicked;
Psalm. 73.21,22. Agur for his brutishness, in regard of spiritual things, Prove.
30.2. Surely I am more brutish then any man, and have not the understanding of
a man: Hezekiah for the pride of his heart, 2 Chronicles. 32.26. for as a man's
graces grow more and more in the new man inward, in the old man so will his
lusts and temptations be: and therefore they that be still exercised about
outward and bodily lusts, it argues a small cleansing in them: but the more a
man considers that God is a Spirit, and his eye is most upon the Spirits of
men, and that these defiling lusts before God make him most like unto the
Devil, who is spiritual wickedness, and he says, My house, and land, and
estate is worth so much, but my heart is nothing worth, Prove. 10.20. for
consider if it were with me as with Maximenius and some of those Roman
Emperors; through their exceeding gluttony their bodies bred vermin
continually; how loathsome should it be for you to think, and to have reason so
to do? but I am a man of a corrupt mind, 1 Timothy 6.5. and that continually
breeds vermin, and will at last the worm that never dies; and this makes a man
loath and abhor himself; it is a good sign of a clean heart.

Secondly, The more a man hates and is afflicted, and gos mourning for not only
the reigning but the being of sin, as it was with the Apostle, that sin had
never rebelled, that it had never led him captive, yet his body of death makes
him miserable, Romans 7.24. the very being of it: when it is with a man in regard
of sin, as it was with leprosy the Type, Lev. 14.44,45. When they had scrapt
about it, and carried out the dust, then they shall sweep it again; then if it
break forth again the house must be plucked down: So when a man has done all he
can by removing the dust, and by carrying out the rubbish, and yet lust will
spread, then to be contented, and desire to have the house dissolved, the house
of nature, that the building of sin might be destroyed, 2 Cor. 5.2. it is an
Argument of a great measure of purity.

Thirdly, The more speedily a man's heart is awakned to turn to God after
sinning: it was a sign that David's heart was in a clean frame, when his heart
smote him, as soon as he had cut off the lap of Saul's garment, 1 Samuel 24.5,6.
and of Peter that immediately he went out and wept bitterly, Math. 26. ult. The
first note was, that a pure heart keeps it self, that the wicked one touches
him not: but the second is speedily to return and cleanse a man's self after
falling: David's heart was in a defiled frame, that he could lie well nigh a
year in the sins of Adultery and Murder, without repentance: the heart of a man
is a fountain, Mat. 12.35. that preserves it self pure and in its first glory
as a fountain does; but if mudd do at any time enter into it, it will be
continually working of it out: and it is as truly an argument of purity as the
other: and when a man repents, that will also afflict him, that God was forced
to use so many means with him before he could be brought to repentance; that
Ephraim bemoans, Ier. 31.18.

Fourthly, The more jealous a man is of himself upon every occasion, Mat.
26.22. How far am I guilty in this sin? Is it I Lord?

Fifthly, The less a man's heart is affected, and the less he is taken with
worldly things, Genesis 15.1. Rev. 12.1. Hem Germana illa Bestia: and as Moses and
Joseph, prefer the good of the people of God before any worldly advantage of
their own.

Sixthly, The more truly glad a man is, and can bless the Lord that he has
been pleased to cross him in a way of sinning; let God cross Ahab and he is in
a rage; better meet a Bear robbed of her whelps, then meet a wicked man God
has crossed in a way of sinning, Pro. 17.12. cross David in a way of sinning,
and he blesses the Lord. And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the Lord God of
Israel which sent thee this day to meet me; and blessed be thy advice, and
blessed be thou which have kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from
avenging myself with my own hand.

The Motives thereunto are these five.

First, this fits a man for communion with the Lord, and makes his communion
more clear; for what communion has light with darkness, Christ with Belial?
and though a man be godly, and so has fellowship with the Father, and with his
son Christ, 1 John 1.6 yet if we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in
darkness, we lie: if therefore walking in darkness take away all fellowship,
then the more a man walks in darkness, the less fellowship he has; therefore
the promise to a clear communion, is unto such as separate themselves; for then
God says, I will receive you, (...) I will dwell in you, 2 Cor. 6.16,17. which
notes clear and near communion.

Secondly, It is a special means to be employed, that God should use a man, 2 Timothy 2.21. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to
honor, san^tified and meet for the Masters use, etc. and so Mal. 3.3. and
Godly men be as happy in their services as in their rewards: on the contrary,
it is a Judgment to be despised of God, so as not to be used; a vessel wherein
he takes no pleasure, Ier. 22.28. The earthen vessels leprous must be broken,
they are of no use.

Thirdly, this will make a man ready and willing to do service; for it is
corruption that is the clog that hinders from service, Heb. 12.1. Let us lay
aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us. Isa. 6.6. and
7.8. when the Lord says, Whom shall I send? the Prophet says, send me: non
tardat uncta rota; but see the contrary in Moses and Jonah; and this makes men
in all the duties God calls them unto, no longer then corruption is bribed, to
drive heavily.

Fourthly, This makes all our services the more sweet unto God, the more clean
the heart is in them, Mal. 3.4. Then shall the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem
be pleasant unto the Lord, etc. Psalm. 66.18. But if I regard iniquity in my
heart, God will not hear me; the duty would be more valuable in Gods account.
Luke 21.3. The poor widow cast in more then they all; because her mite came
from a purer spirit then their great gifts: therefore such services of the
Saints, Christ calls them the honey and the honey-combe, wine and milk: to show
how acceptable they are, Cant. 5.1.

Lastly, consider the glorious motives and encouragements we have therein; as
First the promises, Ezekiel, 47.8. and Zach. 13.2. Secondly, the Spirit of Christ
to be a spirit of burning, Isa. 4.4. and when the Church is in the purest
condition, yet always this spirit is leading her on to perfection still; the
spirit and the Bride says come, Rev. 22.17. and Christ and the Father love the
purity as well as the prosperity of his people: and if we would set faith on
work, he has promised to manifest it, John 14.20,21. In that day ye all know
that I am in my Father: in his counsel, in his ^osom; one with him in Majesty
and in power; and we have the same purposes and intentions toward sinners; and
you in me; your nature and your infirmities, you are in my bosom and in my
heart, clothed with me, and living with me: and while I live, you shall live;
I dyed your death, and you rose my resurrection; I bear your in firmities, and
you are filled with my fullness; I pray your prayers, and you wear my
righteousness; and I in you, not only by my righteousness to justify you, but
by my Spirit to purify you: by my wisdom to guide you: and by my power to keep
you; and by my glory to Crown you: You unto whom I will say, Enter into the joy
of your Lord: these are the better promises of the Gospel; and it is the
lowness of men's spirits, want of Christian greatness of mind, grounded upon the
consideration of this, that is the true cause why Christians lie fettered with
their old failings, and out-grow their infirmities no more then they do.

A Set Time FOR Judgment.
JER. 8.7. The Stork in the heaven knows her appointed times, and the Turtle
and the Crane, and the Swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people
know not the Judgment of the Lord.


EVery faithful Minister of God has a double reference.

First, unto the particular Flock over which God has made him an Over-seer,
Acts 20.28.

Secondly, unto the Land in general where he lives, unto whom God has made him
a watchman to foresee danger, Ezekiel. 3.17. and a Trumpeter to discover it,
Numb. 10.8.

For first, every private Officer in the Church is to have a public spirit,
and so to perform his particular duty, as to have respect unto the general
good; a Minister is so limited to a particular Flock, as he must also remember
that he is the servant of the whole Church; and as every particular Church has
an interest in the gifts of all, 1 Cor. 3.21. so every particular Minister is
to have a care of the good of all: though in a more peculiar manner of the
Flock committed unto his own charge.

Secondly, there are not only Congregational and Personal sins, and mercies,
but there are National also; and there are times when God calls a people to be
humbled for the one, and to be thankful for the other: and in both these, the
Ministers of the Gospel must be employed as Trumpeters to sound forth the
praise of God, and as watchmen to give warning of Gods displeasure, and of the
time and approach of Judgment.

Being thus debtors unto both, we must pay both debts in their season, and be
so far careful of our particular charge, that also we forget not to be faithful
to the Nation, and Church wherein we are: for this is the common Ship in which
we are all embarked, and if this in Judgment be cast away, whether dashed
against the Rock of any foreign power, or swallowed up in the quicksands of
domestic divisions, it must needs hazard all the passengers.

Or if you were sure that for your parts you might be safe, would it not be a
bitter thing to you to stand upon the shore, and to see so glorious a Vessel as
this Nation is to be cast away: to see this glorions Land defaced, the blessed
Gospel polluted, the golden Candlestick removed, it cannot but affect men that
have any bowels.

Or if this move you not, yet to see a stranger to Lord it in thy habitation,
and thy dwelling to cast thee out; for your delightsom dwellings, your pleasant
and welltilled fields to be made a prey, and for you to sow, and another to
reap, Impius has segetes, etc. for the delicate woman upon whom the wind must
not blow, and that scarce dares venture to set the sole of her foot upon the
ground for tenderness, Deuteronomy. 28.26. to be exposed to the lusts and cruelty of
an enemy, and to be glad to fly away naked to prolong a miserable life: which
they would be glad to part with for death, were it not for fear of the
exchange; for the tender mother to look upon the child of her womb, and
consider, Must this child in whom I have placed the hope of my age (for omnis
in Ascanio^stat chari cura parentis) he that has been so tenderly bred up,
must he fall into the rough hands of a bloody soldier, skilful to destroy? it
had been well for me if God had given me a miscarrying womb and dry breasts,
rather then to bring forth children unto murderers: if you might be safe, how
could you endure thus to see the evil that should come upon your people, and
the destruction of your kindred? as it was her expression, Hest. 8 6. I do not
Rhetorize and fawn to draw your affections: your Brethren are a sad Comment
upon what I have spoken, and Ireland the stage upon which you may see this
Tragedy acted before your eyes.

And is this nothing unto all you that pass by, are you nothing concerned in
the misery of your Brethren? is not the Lord come near un to you? and may not
you be consumed by the same fire? tunc tua res agitur. etc. is not Judah nearly
concerned in the desolation of Israel? can we see the dealing of the Lord with
our Brethren, and say, I shall sit down as a Ladyfor ever, and I shall see no
forrow? shall we say, when the overflowing scourge shall pass over, it shall
not come at us? Isa. 28.15. shall we imagine that when the cup of fury that is
in the Lords right hand has gone round, and all nations have tasted of it, and
yet that we shall not drink thereof? Ier. 25.15. may it not be as truly said of
us, as of our brethren, Ezekiel. 12.4. thou have caused thy days to draw near,
thou art come even unto thy years: there is a time for Judgment, the text tells
you, upon a Nation; and he that is wise shall know and discern both time and
Judgment, Eccl. 8.5.

Now as I have before showed you the Ministers are Servants, so also they are
the Prophets of the Nation, and therefore preaching is called prophesying; and
the Ministers of the Gospel are called Prophets 1 Cor. 4.32. though not in so
full and complete a sense as the Prophets anciently were, yet (...), quadam, by
a true resemblance and analogy, though not a foretelling, yet a fore-speaking
things to come, for that God that had made all things by his word, does uphold
all things by the word of his power, Heb, 1.3. governing all things by the
rules of the same, exactly dispensing punishments and rewards according to the
tenor of the promises and threatenings therein recorded, so that as he has
appointed the Sun Moon and Stars to rule by day and by night over this natural
world, Psalm. 19. so he has stretched forth the Expansum of the Law over the
rational world, Romans 10.18. all things being ordered according to the precepts,
promises and threatenings thereof: Now as a man that is skilful in the one by
observing and calculating the influences, and aspects, and conjunctions of the
one, can foretell in many things what is to come in the natural world; So the
other by observing the promises and threatenings, and the special aspects that
is in them both, can in a great measure fore speak what is like to come to pass
in the rational world also: suitable hereunto the Prophet here tells ^s that
there is, First, a time for Judgment. Secondly, that this time may be known.
Thirdly, the ignorance of this time makes a man more brutish then the
unreasonable creatures.

For the scope of the place seems to be this, that such is the wisdom of
unreasonable creatures, the Stork, Crane and Swallow, that in winter they fly
from cold and hard places, unto those where there is a more temperate and
moderate air, they knowing the seasons and the appointed times, for this they
fly away before, and by the instinct of nature to make provision for a natural
life: Now God had made man wiser then the Beasts that perish, above the beasts
of the field, and he has appointed a time for Judgment, and he has foretold
it shall come; and yet man is not so wife for himself, as either to prepare for
it, or to fly from it; and this is meant by not knowing the Judgment of
Jehovah, (...) The Judgment of God is either Directive, as the Law written in
the Book, or the Law written in the heart, as Mat. 12.20. bring forth
Judgementto Victory.

Secondly, Corrective.

Thirdly Destructive; and this last is meant here; it is spoken of the
Judgment of utter ruin and desolation upon whom the former Judgments,
neither the directions of the word, nor corrections of Gods rod had taken its
due effect, its proper work.

Neither is it meant of the Judgment it self only, that it should be utter
destruction, the fatal blow, the last and utter ruin of that people, but also
the time of this Judgment which was at hand, and this the people knew not, and
so much the word in the Hebrew (...) signifies, tempus certum and constitutum;
a certain and an appointed time. Genesis 17.21. My Covenant will I stablish with
Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee (...) at this set time in the next
year: and this seems to be intimated by the subjects; the Stork and the Crane
know their times, but my people know not the Judgment: that is, not only the
Judgment it self, but not the time of Judgment that is at hand: that which
the Prophet had so often told them, and that which they were continually
admonished that it was near, cum in re tam clara and dilucida coecutirent;
therefore here the Prophet does justly complain that they were more brutish
then these unreasonable creatures, (...) they know not; verba sensus
significant cum affectu and effectu; In the count of the Holy Ghost in
Scripture, a man knows no more then he believes, and is affected with, and
makes use of: they knew not, they considered not, believed not, were not
affected with, neither did they make use of it, either the Judgment it self,
nor the time of the Judgment, either to fear it, or to fly from it: so that
the Judgment and the time of Judgment was appointed; this they should, and
they might have known, believed and been affected with, but they were more
unwise for themselves, and for their temporal and eternal safety, then the
unreasonable creatures; they knew not the Judgment of the Lord.

Hence the observations that I purpose to insist upon, are these two. First
that there is unto a sinful Nation, a set and an appointed time of Judgment.
Secondly, that this time may and should be known or else in vain are they
blamed for not knowing it.

First Doctrine.
Doctrine. There is unto a sinful Nation a set and an appointed time for
Judgment: a time when Judgment shall infallibly come, and God will bear with
them no longer: God being the ancient of days, he is the Lord of time, and the
great Landlord of the world, and he has set unto every thing a season, or an
appointed time to every thing under Heaven, Eccl. 3 1. but in reference to the
point in hand, it will be requisite that we consider of a six-fold time
appointed by him that is Lord of time.

First, there is a time of sinning, a set and an appointed time; for there is,
First a fullness of sin, appointed by God that it shall have its period, it
shall not grow in infinitum, Genesis 15.16 The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet
full: and as there was a fullness, so there is a time appointed to fill up this
measure, to fill the Ephah, Zach. 5.6. where the measure of the sin of the
people of Israel is set out for the greatness of it by an Ephah, the greatest
dry measure amongst the Jews: and there was a time for the filling up of the
Ephah, before it was carried into the Land of Shinar.

Secondly, there is a measure of wrath which every vessel of wrath shall
treasure up (for all shall not have the same measure) and the Reason is,
because all do not treasure up the same measure unto themselves, Romans 2.4,5.
Now seeing it is a Treasure that does grow by degrees and several additions,
there must be a time for the filling and the gathering of this Treasure; some
Exchequer days when this Treasure is brought in; so that the time in which men
fill up the measures of sin, and the treasure of wrath, this is that which I
call an appointed time of sinning.

Now as some men, and some Nations measures and treasures are greater then
others, so God gives them an appointed time to fill it up; and being considered
in it self, the greatest Judgment that can befall a man is for the Lord to
give unto a man or a Nation a long time of sinning: as the time that man has
to sin is but small, only during the time of the body, for he shall only give
an account of the things done in the body, not those that are done in statu
separato, 2 Cor. 5.10. and to a man in the body, there is an appointed time
under heaven, Job. 7.1. a short time appointed for his being, and therefore a
short time for his sinning. But the Devil has a large time, from the beginning
of the world, unto the end of it, to the day of Judgment, which argues that
there is much wrath reserved and prepared for him, that must have so long time
to enlarge the vessel, and fit it to receive it; for as gray hairs are a Crown
if they be found in the way of righteousness, Pro. 16.31. that is, it is a
special mercy to live long to add to a man's Crown. so it is a special curse for
a man to go on in evil, and yet his days to be prolonged, Eccl. 8.12.

Secondly, a time of patience, when the Lord holds his peace and reproves not,
Psalm. 50.21. indeed God is angry with the wicked every morning, Psalm. 7.11.
there is not a day that he rises, but a cloud of Gods displeasure rises over
him, but yet he deferrs his Judgment, holds his hand; there is a time, when he
is pressed under their abominations as a Cart is pressed under sheavs, Amos 2.13.
for to have men go on to sin against him, and because Judgment is not executed
speedily, therefore to have their hearts fully set in them to do evil, and the
patience of God to be made the ground and the encouragement of sinning, cannot
be but a great and a heavy burden to the patience of God; and yet there is a
time when the Lord bears, and does not by and by ease himself of his
adversaries, as he says in Judgment he does, Isa. 1.24. and it is an ease to
him, Ier. 32.31. the City of Jerusalem, the Lord says, had been a provocation
to him from the day that it was built, which was many hundred years, and yet
the Lord had born it, and had not removed it out of his sight according as he
threatened for to do; for there is a season for God to glorify all his
attributes; he will make them all exceeding glorious in their time; now after
this life there shall be time to glorify Justice, Mercy and Truth; but the
patience of God can have no place in heaven, nothing that shall burden Gods
patience: and in hell he will show forth no patience: nothing but wrath to the
vessels of wrath: it is the breath, the fury of the Lord that is a River of
Brimstone burning in it, (...) Isa. 30. ult. therefore there must be a time for
the Lord to glorify his patience, and a time for Christ to rule in the midst
of his enemies; and a time for him to rule over them, when they shall be made
his footstool: there must be a time for the decree to conceive and to bear
before it bring forth, Zeph. 2.1. The truth is, we consider not what a precious
time even the time of patience is; to have a poor soul that expects to be
executed at last, but to have two or three years added to his life by way of a
reprival, how great a favor does he esteem it? So for a man or a people to
have deserved death, for the Lord to cut ten or twenty years out of eternity,
but to respit the Judgment, and give a man but so much time of ease, it is a
special and extraordinary favor. It is not time of slackness, but time of
patience, 2 Pet. 3.9.

Thirdly, there is a time of repentance, when God does defer and respit the
Judgment after sinning, of purpose that man may return and come in, Rev. 2.21.
I gave her space to repent, and she repented not: the words are Emphatical,
(...); he gave it, and the principal and proper intent that God had in it, was
this, that they might have time to repent, come in and make their peace in a
time wherein the Lord calls men to repentance, by the ministry of the word,
stretching out his hands all the day long, Ier. 32.33. when the Lord calls to
weeping, mourning, baldness and sackcloth, Isa. 22.7. a time when the Lord
strives inwardly with the spirit of a man, to bring him to a sight of sins and
sorrow for them: a time when, if men seek him he will be found, Isa. 55.6. and
when though the Lord do threaten never so severely, it is but with condition of
repentance; and if then they will come forth and take hold of his strength, and
make peace with him, they shall make peace according to his promise, Isa. 27 5.
when though there be a cloud of blood hang over a people, and grievously
threaten danger, but yet it is but conditional, and if they return and repent
they shall make their peace and God will be again reconciled, and the judgment
shall not come, as we see in Nineveh: for that only I call time of repentance,
when there is hope of mercy; else repentance will not profit; for it comes too
late.

Fourthly, the time of patience and repentance have their periods; indeed these
times are not of the same length to all: to some God shew^ but a little
patience, and to others a great deal, riches of patience, and forbearance, that
though they do evil a hundred times, yet their days are prolonged: so for
repentance, some have but a winters, and others a summers day: but when these
are longest, yet there is a time when they will expire, and time shall be no
more: they have their fixed and set bounds, that they cannot pass.

First, time of repentance; for though the spirit may strive and strive long,
yet he says, he shall not always strive, Genesis 6.3. and though if in the day
of repentance men do come in, he will turn from his fierce wrath, Isa. 55.6.
Yet if this time be past there is a time when the Lord will not be found.
Jerusalem had the day of her visitation, wherein she might have known the
things belonging to her peace; but a great while before the Judgment came,
they were hid from her eyes, Luke 19.42.

Secondly, it is true, the time of patience may last longer then the time of
repentance: for God may withold his hand, even when Judgment is determined
against a people, but yet the time of patience will not always last; the
longest day has its evening: there is indeed a long time sometimes of whetting
the sword, and bending the bow, and making it ready, Psalm. 7.12,3. But there
will be a time of smiting also; no soldier does always whet his sword, but
because he has a purpose to cut at last; though the decree bear long in its
womb yet it will not bear always: there is a time when it will bring forth,
Zeph. 2.1. so that the time of patience has its period.

Fifthly, when the time of patience is expired, there is then a time for
Judgment, a day of recompense, a year of vengeance, a time for the expending
of those Treasures of wrath that have been so long laying in; because there was
by sinning a time of treasuring: and so there shall also come a time of
spending, Romans 2.4,5. a time for the wall that is swelled out to hang, but
there will come a time also when it will fall, Isa. 30.13. husbandmen expect
with much patience the ripening of the grapes; there is a time of ripening, and
there is a time of pressing and treading the winepress, Rev. 14.10. The Butcher
stays till the cattle be fat; there is a fatting-time, and there is a killing
time: and then they shall be plucked out as sheep for the slaughter, Ier. 12.3.

Lastly, when this time does come, the Lord will forbear a people no longer:
this determinating of Judgment in the time of it is exceedingly set before us
in the word, and that under diverse expressions.

First, the Lord does express it by a full and a peremptory resolution that he
will do it, Ezekiel. 21.27. I will over-turn, over-turn, over-turn, and it shall
be no more, I the Lord have spoken it, Chap. 24.14. It shall come to pass, I
will do it, I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent,
but according to thy ways and according to thy doings shall they judge thee,
says the Lord God; they are the expressions of a great, and a full, and
peremptory resolution that will not be turned.

Secondly, it is called a decree, or the bringing forth the decree, Zeph. 2.2.
(...) properly signifies decretum or statutum scriptum, from the root (...)
scripsit: and so it is commonly used in the Scripture, and so I conceive it to
be understood, non de occulto consilio, sed de decreto promulgato. Its true in
that the word of God by the ministry of the Prophets, there were many
threatenings and judgments denounced, but faetus adhuc in utero latet: there is
a time when all these threatenings will take place, for they shall not be in
vain, there is not a word that goes forth, but it shall accomplish the thing
that I speak, Isa. 55.11.

Now it is called a decree in a double respect.

First decrees are acts of authority.

Secondly, they are established and firm, they shall not be altered or
disannulled; therefore every judgment is a decree, and though it may be long
hid, that a man does not know what is in the womb of it, yet there will come a
time for the Decree of God to be delivered, and then there is no hope: men
shall be as chaff, and pass away in that day.

Thirdly, it is called swearing in his wrath, Psalm. 9.11. It is true that the
word of God is as firm and sure as his oath; for Heaven and Earth shall pass
away, rather then one jot of it shall pass away: but yet in the word there may
be, and commonly is, an implicit and a tacit condition; as we see, Ier. 18.18.
If I speak concerning a a Nation or a Kingdom, to pluck it up and destroy it,
if that Nation turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought
to do unto them: but the oath of God shuts out all secret and tacit conditions
whatsoever, that nothing shall arise de novo, that shall hinder the
accomplishment thereof; which must not be conceived, as if it were peculiar
unto that time, or unto this people, but that the Lord does constantly the same
against other people, and in other times also, as the Apostle plainly manifests
to us, Heb. 3.11,12.

Fourthly, those means that do usually prevail with God, and turn away
Judgment when it is threatened, In the time of Judgment they prevail nothing
with the Lord: and they are these.

First, repentance comes too late; so much the Prophet does intimate, Zeph.
2.1,2. gather your selves, that is, by repentance and public humiliation, but
what is the season? it must be before the decree come forth implying otherwise
it would not avail; many there were no doubt in Judah, that were the Basket of
good figs, that did repent and humble themselves but yet it came too late to
keep off the Judgment, they must be carried into captivity as well as the bad:
indeed repentance never comes too late, if it be true, to prevent the curse:
but many times it may come too late to keep off the cross

Secondly, but if that to their repentance they add prayers, will not the Lord
hear them? Prove. 1.28. they shall call, but I will not answer: for there is a
time when that the Lord will not be found, Isa. 55.6.

Thirdly, but what if to their prayers they add fasting, will not the Lord hear
them then? No, Ier. 14.12. When they fast I will not hear their cry, but I will
consume them by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.

Fourthly, but if God will not do it for their own sakes, yet it may be he may
for some other godly man's sake, if the godly pray for them; they may stand in
the gap, as we know Moses did, and did hinder the breaking in of Judgment upon
the people: No, then the Lord will not hear them, Jer. 7.16. Pray not for this
people, neither lift up a cry or a prayer for them, for I will not hear thee.

Fifthly, but yet if he will not hear one of the Saints apart, yet the united
prayers of the godly may prevail far with him, and that may overcome; but the
Lord names the most powerful men with God that ever were, Ezekiel. 14.14. Noah,
Daniel, Job, and Moses, and Samuel, Jer. 15.1. and yet the Lord says, if they
did stand before him (an expression of prayer and intercession) yet his mind
could not be toward that people.

There is therefore a set and appointed time for judgment, and if that be once
come, the Lord will forbear a people no longer; it will be easier to weigh the
fire, to measure the winds, to recall the day that is past, to change the
Ordinances of heaven, and to restore the verdure of the withered grass, then to
reverse the Sentence and Decree gone forth against a sinful Nation; for as
Samuel said to Saul, he is not a man that he should repent.

Doctrine.
This time of Judgment may and must be known: for why are they blamed if they
might not? and how justly could they be blamed if they ought not to have known
it? Mat. 16.3. It is that Christ reproves in the Pharisees, they could discern
the true face of the sky, but could not discern the signs of the times: one
might have been done as well as the other, if they had applied themselves to the
like care and industry.

But may it be known? as the Lord governs the world by the Sun, Psalm. 19.1.
Romans 10.18. and in nature does many times cause Comets and blazing Stars as
tokens of some dangerous and dismal accidents approaching in nature: so has
the Lord set forth by the Book of the Word, some signs also hat are as so many
Comets to the world, if a man does wisely behold them by a spiritual eye and a
right judgment resulting from them: for the ways of God are unchangable; he
is not wearied with process of time, neither can he be ever won to give his
blessing in one age, which he has cursed in another: and therefore that which
has been a sign of Judgment in one age, must needs be so in another: for the
word of God is like to a well-drawn picture, that casts an eye upon every
person and every Nation alike. It is necessary therefore to enquire what be the
signs foregoing Judgment, which the Scripture does set down.

I will only mention these two, which I desire every one that is wise will lay
to heart, that so he may be able a little to discern the signs of the times.

First, a fullness of sin: that is made the sign when Judgment was to come upon
the Amorites, Genesis 15.16. when their iniquity was full: and this is made the
ground of bringing Judgment, put in thy sikle and reap, for the harvest is
ripe, Joel 3.16. So Jer. 1.11,12. An Almond tree has the first ripe fruit of
any tree, and it notes the hastening of them to ripen their sins; and the Lord
says, as they did hasten their sins to a ripeness, so he would hasten to ripen
his Judgments, so that this is a certain sign foregoing Judgment: But when is
sin full? when is it ripe in a Nation? I know Divines commonly and truly set
forth the fullness of sin by its universality, impudency and obstinacy, but I
will not insist upon these.

But let us look into this Nation of Judah, of which our Prophet speaks here,
and see what did ripen their sins, and brought them to that fullness that
brought the Judgment: see what it was amongst them that filled the Epha, and
made way for the women with the wind in their wings to carry them away.

First, when a people seeks to make void the Law: then it is time for God to
work: that is, to execute Judgment; so David says, Psalm. 119.126. the word in
the original is (...) which signifies irritum facere, non palam ex professo,
sed oblique: not by open opposing, but by secret undermining; it is fitly
expressed by our Savior, Mat. 13.6. (...) ye have unlorded, taken away the
ruling power of the Law by your Traditions; how this has been done in this
Nation, in these latter times, is not unknown unto them that know any thing of
the Doctrine of this Church; sometimes by opposing Scripture to Scripture,
sometimes by subtle distinctions, grounded upon Scriptures in a show, by
misinterpretations and frigid expositions put upon Scripture, by false
conclusions and Paralogismes drawn out of Scripture, and by customs and Church
traditions put upon it as the practice of the Primitive Church, the Judgment
of the learned; and all that the wisdom of men, and not the Law of God might
rule; but when men come so far that they dare not only to change the Laws of
men, but to temper with, and un-lord the Law of God, it is time for the people
of God to pray, and then it is time for God to work.

Secondly, corrupting the worship of God by humane inventions, that have a show
of wisdom, and willworship to hold correspondency with Idolaters, Jer. 2.33.
Why trimest thou thy way to seek love? he speaks it of their correspondence
with Idolaters: sometimes with Egypt, and sometimes with Assyria^ they did so
order things in Gods worship as might best further their Politic ends; now
this triming did please, and then another, and all was to please their Lovers.
How much triming has been used in this Nation of late years? we must have
Altars, Crucifixes, Copes, Tapers, Basins: sometimes we have been taken with
the French, sometimes the Spanish, and sometime the Italian fashion; what is
this but to trim our way to seek love?

Thirdly, Confederacy with Idolaters of a contrary Religion. Ier. 2.36. why
gaddest thou about to change thy way? sometimes they went down to Egypt,
sometimes they did sly to Assyria, etc. this is called the fornication of the
Nations Ezekiel. 16. The gadding of this Nation of latter times in this kind, I
need not speak of that; it is too well known unto most Nations in the Christian
world; but all that ever we are like to get by it is the same that was the gain
of this people; Ahaz made a confederacy with the King of Assyria. 2 Chronicles.
28.20. and he came and distressed him, but strengthened him not.

Fourthly, abusing the Messengers of God, 2 Chronicles. 36.16. They mocked his
Messengers, and they mis used his Prophets, till the wrath of God rose up
against them that there was no remedy. How far this has taken place in these
latter days is not unknown to all; many of them imprisoned, disgraced,
deprived: and those that did enjoy their liberty for the most part Prophesied
in Sackcloth, Rev. 11. in much affliction and full of doubts and fears, every
one suspecting whether what he did would please or no.

Fifthly, not laying to heart the afflictions of our Brethren, Amos 6.6.7. They
drink wine in bowls, and stretch themselves upon beds of Ivory; therefore they
shall go into Captivity with the first that go Captive: how far we have been
affected with the distresses of our brethren in France formerly, the
desolations in Germany, and the present unheard of cruelties in Ireland, our
hearts know very well, and it will be well if in the day when the Lord makes in
juisition for blood, some of this blood be not found bound up in our own skirts.

These were the evils that ripened the harvest of sin with them, and moved the
Lord to say unto the Executioner of Judgment, put in thy sickle and reap, oel
3.13. and how can we expect but that it shall be so with us also? for God
measures all Nations with the same line, and the same plumet, Isa. 28.17.

Secondly, the beginnings of Judgment are an evident token that the time of
Judgment draws near: When the Fig Tree puts forth leaves you say summer is
near; so when you se these things come to pass say it is near, even at the
door. Lu 2.30 3 For he says in Judgment, when begin, I will also make an end,
1 Samuel 3.12 as former mercies be pledges of future and meat for the soul to
feed upon in the expectation of mercy; he gave them to be meat to his people in
the wilderness, Psalm 74.14. so former Judgments are meat also for the soul to
feed upon in the expectation of future; for the wrath of God breaking in upon a
people, is like a breach in awall where the enemy will be sure with all
violence to break in if no man stand in the gap to make resistance: impossible
a patente porta iram Dei non procedere. For by a lesser Judgment God makes way
for his anger, for a perfect and an utter ruin, Psaul. 78.50.

Let us see whether the same way be not made with us as it was with them.

First, all Nations about them were against them, Ier. 12.9. Mine inherit^nce
is as a speckled Bird; the Birds round about her are against her as a strange
Bird seldom seen: the Birds usually fall upon and set themselves against her;
and if we did wisely consider the estate of this Kingdom how it is a speckled
bird, and how the Nations about her are against her as a strange bird, it were
easy to conceive, and what expectations most of them have from the present
state of things amongst us it is not hard to guess.

Secondly, the general corruption and decay of truth and wisdom of men in
places of greatest trust: their silver becomes dross, and their wine mixed with
water, Isa. 1.22. their Judges and Officers, and men in authority, growing
daily more and more corrupt: the best of them is a Briar, Mich. 7.4. that is, a
poor man flies to them for shelter as a sheep to a thorny hedge, and instead of
defending, they do fleece him in; and what follows? the day of thy watchmen,
and thy visitation comes; now shall be their perplexity; what has been the
condition of this state we all know; how servants have ruled over us, and there
was none to deliver us out of their hands: men of servile birth and education,
and servile spirits, in so much that there has been no peace either to him
that went out, or to him that came in; for God did vex us with all adversity, 2 Chronicles. 15.6.

Thirdly, the subversion of fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, which the
Scripture calls the foundation upon which a Kindom stands: which was a bitter
complaint of the Church of God in this state; all the foundations of the earth
were out of course, Psalm. 82.5. what invasions have been made upon us, and our
Laws, has been abundantly of late discovered: and Solomon tells us, that he
that breaks a hedge, a Serpent shall bite him, Eccl. 10.8. he speaks it of this
hedge by which a people are defended, and kept several, that all do not become
first a Common, and then a Wilderness.

Lastly, private and intestine divisions amongst us, the fore-running of Gods
last and fiercest wrath upon that people, Ephraim against Manassch, and both
against Judah, Isa. 9. ult which the Lord says is as if one member in the same
body should be injurious to another as if a man should eat the flesh of his
own arm; and how far the wrath of God is at present stretched forth against
this Nation, we all know and complain of; what secret whisperings and
murmurings, what jealousies and fears there are one of another, and what
parties, and how for these divisions there do arise great thoughts of heart, we
can never sufficiently bewail, which does continnally threaten that the Lord
will take us and dash us one against another as Potters Vessels.

These were the forerunners of Judgment with this Nation, which did show them
that the time of Judgment was at hand: and these are now the sins of the
times, which may justly occasion us to conceive that the time of Judgment is
at hand; let it not be our sin which is here reproved as theirs, that we should
not know the time of the Judgment of the Lord.

Use.
Use for direction only in five things.

First, not to know the time is misery enough: therefore men are taken suddenly
and unawares ensnared in an evil time, as birds in an evil share, and as fishes
in an evil net, Eccl. 9.12.

Secondly, that you may know the time to improve this promise. Whosoever
keeps the Commandment shall find no evil; a wise man's heart shall discern
time and Judgment, Eccl. 8 5.

Thirdly, a wise man foresees the evil, and hides himself; but fools pass on,
and are punished, Prove. 22.3.

First, by a work of humiliation; Hab. 3.16. When I heard, my belly trembled;
rottenness entered into my bones, I trembled in my self, that I might rest in
the evil day.

Secondly, a work of reformation, Zeph. 2.3. Seek righteousness, seek meeknes^;
it may be you may be hid in the day of the Lords wrath.

Thirdly, improve all the promises, that perfection to which you are called,
Isa 26 ult come my people, enter into your chambers: the Promises and
Attributes are the chambers of the godly; but you must come into them, else
they will afford no shelter: upon all the glory shall be a defense.

Fourthly, be much in prayer; to lay in for this time, will be profitable for
you; for know, prayer never proves ineffectual to a spiritual end: it never in
this respect comes too late, because God never comes too late. 1 King, 18.45.
Luke 21.36. Watch therefore and pray continually, that you may be accounted
worthy to escape all those things that shall come to pass: fidelibus
orationibus Deum ambimus, coelum tundimus.

Fifthly, betake thy self to the mediation of Christ, Mich. 5.5. for this man
shall be the peace when the enemy comes into the Land: he is a refuge from the
storm, a defense from the wind, a river of water in a dry place: and the
shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land, Isa. 52.2. therefore return you to
your strong holds, you prisoners of hope, Zach. 9.12. Remember his name is
Shilo the peacemaker, and he is so called everywhere; when the Scepter departs
from Judah, Genesis 49.9. there must needs be nothing but trouble: yet then he is
the peacemaker, then does Shilo come.
