between Clerk and Wentworth about 35. Eliz. The Father committed a forfeiture,

Herriot, allows of a dying seized. Bacon contra Thurley, Hillar. 1592.

Decree.
IN the Judgment Roll of 36.37. and 38. H. 8. there is a Decree to be seen to
the ^o effect hereafter mentioned, where Daniel and the rest of the Inhabitants
of Crudworth, in the County of Warwick, exhibibited a Bill against Thomas
Arderne for title of Common, and to have certain enclosed lands open. It was
decreed that Ardern and his heirs should hold the same lands so enclosed,
discharged of the Common, because it seemed that the Inhabitants had Common
enough besides, and that the laying open the lands called Martinmas Leyse,
would be a great decay of Husbandry, Rotulo Judicial' 3. pars.
Rotul' Iudicial' Ed. 6.2. pars, there is a Decree between Dudley and his Wife,
pretending to be Executors of one Morgan, who supposes himself to be
Administrator to that Morgan, And because the Plaintiff had not sufficiently
proved such Will, and for that the Defendant sued forth his Letters of
Administration, therefore all the goods of the Intestate were decreed to the
Defendant, allowing Debts, Legacies, and Funeral charges.

A Decree between Tur^on and Cook Plaintiffs, and Goddard, Defendant, whereby
it appears that the controversy was touching the Messuages or Farm houses,
and three hundred Acres of land in Haughton, in the County of Southamton, which
the Plaintiff supposed to have been Demised to Robert Tanner, and which the
Defendant claims as Executor unto Thomas Goddard, and that because the
Plaintiffs proved not the contents of their Bill, and the Defendant made proof
of his Answer, therefore the premises and the Lease thereof made to the
Defendants Testator, were decreed to the Defendant against the Plaintiff, and
that the Defendant after Midsommer then next, should enter and hold the
premises (without En^^^^ to be made by the Plaintiff) till he should recover
the same by Action at the common Laws and furthermore it was ordered that the
Defendant should be dismissed.

The like Decree in the same Roll between (...) Plaintiff and Gittins
Defendant, whereby it appears, that the Plaintiff had purchased certain lands
of the Kings, whereof he supposed John Brown Clerk (to whom the Plaintiff was
Executor) had an Abbots Lease, and the Defendant pretended that the two
Messuages and one Yard land, was letten unto him by Lease under Covenant and
Seal for fourscore and one years, and traversed the Plaintiffs title and the
Plaintiff proved not his Bill, and therefore the premises were decreed to the
Defendant according to his Lease, for all the years then to come therein, and
the Plaintiff adjudged to pay him sixteen shillings eight pence.

Note that it is decreed to him without any quousq that it should be recovered
at law and without any liberty, to show better matter in this Court.

The like Decree in that Roll, between William Messinger Quer', and the Major
and Burgesses of Gloucester, touching diverse Manors; Forasmuch as upon the
hearing of the matter, the Defendant showed a Tripartite Feoffement of the
premises, from John Cook to the Major and Burgesses, to the use of a
Free-schoole and other purposes, And because the Plaintiff proved not the
matter of his Bill and Replication, therefore the said Manors and lands. etc.
were decreed to the Defendants and their Successors, to their uses, and that
the Plaintiff should by Christmas next deliver them all the Evidences
concerning the same.

The like Decree in that Roll between Thomas Stowell and Anthony Capps,
reciting, that where the Lord William Pawlet, Lord President of the Council,
and Lord Keeper of the great Seal, 22 Oct. Anno 5. Eliz. 6. because the
Plaintiff had not proved his title to the Manors, etc. decreed the said
Manors to the Defendant and his heirs till the Plaintiff should recover the
same at the Common Law, and that the Defendant should also have the Arrerages,
and twenty shillings costs; The Plaintiff being grieved with that Decree, and
exhibiting a new Bill to the Lord Rich, having at the Plaintiffs instance heard
the Cause, and given diverse days to the Plaintiff, to show what he could to
reverse that Decree, did afterward, because no just cause was showed, to
frustrate or alter that Decree, dismiss the Defendant.

Also a like Decree in that Roll, between Richard Lewknor, and Dame Elizabeth
his Wife Plaintiffes, and Robert Barwick Defendant, because the Plaintiffs
proved not the matter of their Bill and Replication, and because the Defendant
proved a Lease to be made to him six years since of the Farm of Elleston, by
one Sir Roger Lewknor, therefore the Defendant was dismissed. And it was
further by the Authority aforesaid decreed, that the Defendant should enjoy his
Lease, without interruption of the Plaintiffs, or either of them, and the
Plaintiffs should pay him forty shillings Costs.

A Decree between Fotheringall and Edsington Defendant, Rotulo Judicial' E. 6
4. pars.
the question was touching certain lands which the Plaintiff claimed by Lease,
and which the Defendant claimed as Copihold; And forasmuch as he failed in the
proof, and the Defendant showed his Copy and ancient Court Rolls, proving it
to be ancient Coppihold, therefore the lands were decreed to the Defendant
according to his Copy, against the Plaintiff his Executors and Assigns, till
the Plaintiff should prove a better title before the Council at York, and
yet if the Plaintiff did trouble the Defendant or his Wife at York, or any
other the Kings Courts, then he should pay five pounds Costs, and the
Defendant was then dismissed with twenty shillings Costs presently.

Another Decree in the same Roll between Gervas and Gawen, to the same effect
aforesaid.

The like decree in the same Roll between Westwood and Westwood.

A Decree between ap-Edward, Rotul' Judicial' Edw. 6.8. pars.

default, did counter feit an absolute Decree, and put the Lord Chancellours

Assignees should enjoy the lands, and take the profits thereof against the
Plaintiff and his heirs, till he or they should prove a better title in this
Court.

he tell him there is a trust.

FINIS.
THE PROCEEDINGS of the High-Court of CHANCERIE.
NOtwithstanding the practice here before this time has been, That no Subpoena
should be sued forth of the court of Chancery without a bil of complaint first
exhibited: yet of late, for the ease of all suitors and subjects, it has been
thought good, that every man may have a Subpoena out of the same Court, without
any Bill first exhibited.

And this is called a Sub poena adrespondendum.

This Sub paena is the leading Process of this Court, by which the party
defendant against whom the complaint is intended, is summoned and required to
appear and make answer to the complainant, under a certain pain, and at a
certain day to come.

The days of Return here are the usual Returns, as in the ordinary
Almanac; or else a Sub poena may be returneable at a certain day, after any
the said usual Returns, or the great Feast days, from whence the Returns
take their denomination: So that you must add (prox') in place where cause
shall require.

As, if the Feast day be to come, then it must be Prox. futur. in unum mensem.

But if the Feast day be past, then it must be die Paschae in unum mensem prox
futur.

And the like to other Returns, before or after other Feast days.

Where, note what time you have for exhibiting of your Bill after the day of
Return prefixed in your writ of Sub-p^na: If it be returneable upon a general
Return day, as Crastin', Octabis, Tres, Men's, etc. after such a Feast, then
you have time to put in your Bill uutill the second day before noone next
following, the fourth day following every of the said Returns: and you must
account the Return day, and the fourth day after it, for two of the said four
days.

But if the Sub-paena be returneable on such a certain day of the month, then
your Bill must be put in the second day after it before dinner.

And howsoever the Sub-paena be returneable, if it be but served on the same
day whereon it is returneable, before noone, and the rising of the Court of
Chancery, it is a good serving, and binds the defendant so served to an
appearance with all convenient speed.

If a Sub paena be returneable on a day certain, as on any day of the month,
the bill not being in, the desendants Attorney may prefer costs the next day
after; and if the bill come not in the next day after costs so preferred before
noone or presently after dinner, the defendant is discharged with such costs as
a Master of the Court taxes him.

And so in the like case for a Sub paena that is returnable on a return day,
the next day after the fourth day is cost day, and if the bill come not in the
next day at noon or presently after dinner, the defendant, having preferred his
costs the day before, is discharged from attendance, with his costs.

When the defendant has so got costs, he may have a Sub paena whereby to
command the complainant presently, upon the sight thereof, to pay the defendant
or the bringer thereof, the said costs, (as aforesaid:) Which Sub-paena must be
served on the Plaintiff personally. And if the complainant do refuse to pay
the said costs accordingly, then the defendant may, upon Affidavit made that
the Sub-paena for cost was served, have an Attachment directed to the Sheriff
of the County, to attach the complainant therefore.

And upon return made by the Sheriff that the complainant cannot be found, an
Attachment with Proclamation may be sued forth against the complainant.

And that Proclamation being likewise returned by the Sheriff (as aforesaid)
then a Commission of Rebellion may be sued forth against the complainant.

But on the contrary, if the complainant do put in his bill, and the defendant
appears not the next day after costs day (which costs day is usually the next
day after the four days upon a return is out, or if the Sub-paena be
returnable on a day certain, then the next day after is costs day) then the
complainant upon oath made that the defendant was served with a Sub-paena, may
have an Attachment, and further Process upon the Sheriffs returns of non est
inventus.

Where note, that the party which makes oath that he served the Sub paena: Or
that the Sub-paena was served, must swear as follows:

That he delivered the Sub paena to the defendant.

Or he showed the Sub paena to the defendant under the seal of the Court, and
delivered to him a note of the day of his appearance, or a labell of the Sub
paena.

Or he left the Sub paena at the defendants dwelling house or lodging, where
the defendant most abides.

Or he must swear that he heard the defendant confess that he was served with
a Sub-paena.

Or he must swear that he saw another serve the defendant with a Sub-paena.

Note, that if the party served with any such Sub-paena do wrong or abuse the
party who served it for the serving thereof, or uses: any words of contempt or
sleighting of his Majesty's said Writ; upon oath made thereof, and motion
thereupon, he is punishable for the same, by imprisonment in the Fleet, or
otherwise at the Lord Keepers discretion.

And if the defendant do appear within the time limited, then the complaynants
Attorney may give unto the defendants Attorney, on the said day after the costs
day, a Rule, that the defendant do make answer to the complainants Bill, by
the same day seven-night then next to come. This Rule and day given, must be
entered into the Register.

And if the defendant do not answer by the prefixed day so entered; or if he
do not otherwise satisfy the Court by sufficient cause, and occasion of the
delay, then the complainants Attorney may take forth an Attachment against the
defendent.

The Causes whereby the defendant may satisfy the Court of the said delay in
answer, are these, for the most part, of which the defendant must make oath,
(viz.)
He cannot make direct answer, without sight of his Evidences or Writings
which are in the Country.

Or he cannot answer without conference had first with some Person named in the
said Bill.

Or with some Person whom the matter touches.

Or if the Bill be against the defendant, to express what goods he has of the
plaintiffes, he may make oath he cannot make perfect answer to the plaintiffes
bill without sight and perusal of the said goods, which are in the country:
And that place in the country, where those goods or writings, or parties live,
must be above twenty miles from London, or else he must answer within eight
days after his appearance, unless he get further time by order: And, if he
do make such oath, then his answer is spared till the first day of the next
Term following.

This oath be made by the Solicitor, or some oother for the defendant.
Or that the defendant is not able to Travel without danger of his life, etc.

And if upon such oath made, the plaintiff refuse to allow the defendant a
Dedimus potestatem for taking his answer in the Country, the Court upon motion
or petition will order it; which order is to be entered in the Register, and the
Affidavit filed in the Affidavit Office.

In case the defendant do not appear, or having appeared does not answer in
his time limited, nor shows any of the aforesaid reasons in excuse, then an
Attachment is awarded against him, which must be entered both in the house-book
in the six Clerks Office, and in the Register, expressing the cause of the
issuing of the said Attachment.

But if no day be given to the defendant to answer, then the defendant has
liberty to answer at any time during the Term.

And if he do it not within that time, hen an attachment may be sued forth
against him of course: and the same, with the cause thereof, must be entered
into the Register: (viz.) That the Defendant appeared, and departed without
answ^r.

If the Sub-paena be returnable so nere the end of the Term, that there cannot
be a day given to the defendant to answer, he must at his peril answer by the
same day sevennight following the day of his appearance, although it be in the
Vacation: For the Chancery is always open. It is Officina semper aperta.

If the Sub paena be returnable on the last return day of the Term it self,
then the defendant is at liberty to apapeare the first Return of the Term
following.

But if it be a day certain, although the same be the last day of the Term,
yet the Defendant must appear and answer by that day sevenight next following
the said appearance.

Note, there are no such Sub-paenas to answer returnable immediately in Term
time.

And if the defendant make Oath that he cannot answer without Writings etc. or
conference with some other person: Or if he have a Dedimus Potestatem, and
Commission to make his answer he must at his peril procure his answer to be
put in before the day after the first Costs day of the next Term following,
unless it be Trinity Term; and then, and in such case, it must be put in the
second day after the second return, else the complainants Attorney may, upon
such default, make an attachment against the defendant, and enter the same into
the Register, For that he has not answered by the day prefixed.

Or in other case, that he appeared and departed without answer; Or otherwise
that he did not return the Dedimus potestatem at the day prefixed, etc. and as
the cause shall require.

If a Defendant living in the Country, having a Dodimus Potestatem granted him
for the taking of his answer to the Plaintiffes Bill, or his Council find
there is cause of Plea or Demurrer, upon a motion or petition, he may have a
special Dedimus Potestatem by Order to answer, plead, or demur; But the
Commissioners upon an ordinary Dedimus have no power to take any thing but an
answer; And if a Demurrer be put in without Commission, the party must put the
same in into the six Clerks Office in his own person: And if the Demurrer or
Plea be not put into the Paper of Pleas and Demurrers in the Register appointed
for that purpose, within eight days after the same is put in Court, to the end
the same be argued before the Lord Keeper, as it shall fall in course after
others; then the said Plea and Demurrer is overruled of course, and the
Plaintiff may take forth a Sub-paena against the Defendant to make a better
answer, and an other for Costs, according to the Lord Keepers late Orders.

This was wont to be the course, but my Lord Keeper of late has declared, that
if a bill have cause of Demurrer he will not a bad bill good.

In case a man be served with a Subpaena wherein his wife is named he being in
London and his wife in the country or elsewhere, if he appear not for her, or
she answer not as well as he, an Attachment is granted against them both
though he appear and answer for himself.

If she do not appear, then the Attachment is against him and her for her
not appearance.

If she do not answer, then against him and her for her not answering.

If a Complainant die depending the suite, his Heir, Executor, or
Administrator, who has the Interest in the thing complained for, may put in a
Bill of Revivor against the Defendant: or if the Defendant die, the Plaintiff
may put in a Bill of Revivor against his Heir, Executor or Administrator.

Also it is to be remembered, that if the Complainant exhibit his Bill against
a man and his wife, for matter which wholly concerns the wife, whereunto they
make answer, and after answer made, the man dies; the Complainant cannot
proceed in that suit against the woman without a Bill of Revivor, because the
woman shall not be constrained to stand to that answer, which she together with
her Husband or solely (as wife unto the man) made to the Complainant, for that
she was the under Coverture.

And after her husbands death (she being seized or possessed of the thing in
Controversy as in her former estate) may (if she please) make a new answer,
and shall never be bound or concluded by the answer which she made in her
Husbands life time, for that she was then under Coverture. And yet (if she so
please) she may stand to that former answer of hers and proceed in that suite
accordingly.

But if the Complainant exhibit a Bill against a Feme sole, whereunto she
makes answer, and afterward marries, the Complainant may proceed against her
husband and her without any Bill of Revivor: and her, husband shall be bound by
that answer which she made before marriage, because she shall not be admitted
to take advantage of her own act.

Where (on the contrary) if a Feme sole exhibit her bill of Complaint,
whereunto the Defendant answers, and afterward she takes an husband, her
husband and she shall not proceed against the Defendant, without a Bill of
Revivor; because her suite is abated by her own act, whereof the Defendant may
take advantage.

And if a Man and his Wife exhite a Bill of Complaint, whereunto the Defendant
answers and the Man dies, the woman shall be at her choice whether she will
exhibit a new Bill, or proceed upon the former.

Note that in Chancery you cannot serve the Wife without her husband, though
the matter in question do only concern her, and not him.

Also, if two seized of joint estate; or two Executors of one Testament; or two
Obligers or Obligees exhibit a Bill of Complaint, whereunto the Defendant
answers, and one of them dies. The Survivor of them may proceed against the
Defendant, without any Bill of Revivor.

And in all cases where a Bill of Revivor is requisite after the said Bill
exhibited, and a Sub-paena served on the Defendant to that purpose: the
Complainant shall be in the same case, as he for his Predecessor was, at the
time when the cause of Revivor accrewed, unless the Defendant shall appear
upon the said Sub-paena, and by way of answer show good cause to the contrary:
which Cause must be, that the Complainant in the Bill of Revivor, is not Heir,
or Executor, nor stands in the like case, nor have the like interest, or the
like cause of Complaint, as before in the former suite.

And no other cause is to be allowed. If the Complaynant exhibit his Bill of
Complaint, for Title of any Lands, not of the yearly value of forty shillings:
And the same be proved by Affidavit, or deposed, the Defendant shall be
dismissed.

Also, if the Defendant demurte to any Bill exhibited against him, or
disclaim: the Complaynant cannot reply:

For if the Defendant be called up by Sub-paena ad Rejungendum, having before
made no other answer but a Demurer or a Disclaimer, he shall have costs for
unjust vexation.

But after the Defendant has answered, the Complaynant has liberty all that
Term, and all the next Term following that; and until the beginning of the
second Term after answer, to put in his Replication.

The next Term after answer put in, the Defendants Attorney may give the
Plaintiff a Rule to Reply, and if he does not Reply, then costs are awarded,
and if he give no Rule and the Plaintiff reply not the second Term after the
Term the Answer was put in, the Bill may be dismissed with costs by morgage or
of course.

But if the Complaynants Replication be put into the Court, the Defendant can
have no costs allowed unto him.

But then the Defendant may, if he^ will, Rejoyne gratis to the Replication,
and enforce the Complainant to go to Commission.

Which if the Complainant refuse, then the Defendant may have Commission to
examine Witnesses on his own part against the Complainant, and shall have the
carriage thereof.

The Commission shall be directed to four such persons as the Defendant shall
name; or to any three or two of them, without any warning to be given to the
Complainant.

But if in this case the Complainant will, he may join in Commission, and have
the carriage of it himself.

And then he must name four Commissioners indifferent men; and the Defendant
four more, and two being struck out on each side the Commission is made up to
the four that remain: and the Complainant having the carriage of the
Commission must give the Defendant fourteen days warning of the day and place
when and where the Commission shall be executed.

This warning must be given, either by himself in person, or else left in
Writing, at the House or place where the Defendant does most reside.

The Complainant in all cases of Commission to examine witnesses, shall have
the first choice of Commissioners, and carriage of the Commission, and if he
fail by not executing it, then the Defendant may renew it and have the
carriage thereof, and give the Complaynant the like notice.

If a Defendant be served with a Sub-paena ad Rejungendum, and Oath be thereof
made; Commissioners names being called for in the Term time to the Defendants
Attorney, and the Defendant refuse to join in Commission the second Seal
after the Term, the Complainants Attorney may make a Commission ex part to
the Complaynants own Commissioners and Interessers must be included in the
Commission

He shall examine Witnesses, in all these cases following: (Viz.)

FIrst, upon a Bill by him preferred to examine Witnesses in perpetual memory
of the matter to command the Defendant either by himself, or by his Attorney
to appear immediately; and within fourteen days to show cause why the
Complaynant should not examine Witnesses ^in perpetual memory.

And if the Defeudant do thereupon appear by himself, or his Attorney, and
show good cause to the contrary, such as the court shall allow, then the
Complaynant shall not examine any witnesses in perpetuam rei memoriam, or
perpetual memory.

But if he do show no sufficient cause, nor join in Commission with the
complainant, then the Complainants Attorney must prefer six Commissioners
names to the Lord Keeper, or the court, etc. Four of the which, or four such
other, as the Lord Keeper or the court shall appoint, shall be set down for
Commissioners; and a Commission for the Complaynant shall be made forth, and
directed to the said four Commissioners, or any three, or two of them, to
examine witnesses, according to certain Articles heretofore set down in
Chancery, which Witnesses are never to be published, during their lives,
unless Oath be made.

That the Complainant has some trial wherein he should give them in evidence

That the witnesses are notable to travel to the place where the trial should
be.

Or the Party Defendant will consent thereunto.

Neither can they be given in Evidence against another, but against the party
which was called, to show cause why the said witnesses should not be examined,
or some other, claiming under him by some interest which accrewed unto them,
after the Bill preferred by the Complainant for the examination of witnesses.

It is also used, that either party, after the Bill is exhibited, add Answer
made thereunto, may examine witnesses in court here before one of the Examiners.

But the Complainant can have no Commission to examine his witnesses, unless,
and before the Defendant be served with a Sub-paena ad Rejungendum: Which
Sub-paena must be served in such manner as is before mentioned:

And then upon Affidavit made of the serving thereof, the Complaynant (if the
Defendant appear not that Term) shall have a Commission directed to four such
Commissioners as himself shall name, or to any three, or two of them, for the
examination of witnesses on his part, against the Defendant, without any
warrant to be given to the Defendant.

Upon the return of the said Sub^pae. na ad Rejungendum, The Complainant may
give to the Defendant a day to Rejoyne (viz.) The same day seven-night.

By which time, if the Defendant do not rejoyne, he shall lose the benefit
thereof.

And when that day so given to rejoyn; is past, the Complainant may give two
ordinary days, (viz.) two Returns, for the Defendant to produce his
witnesses; and then a Peremptory day:

Before which day past, if the Defendant do come in, he may have a Commission
to examine witnesses of course, without any motion; but he shall lose the
benefit of Rejoinder: And the Complainant, if he please to join in the
Commission, shall have the carriage of it, giving to the Defendant fourteen
days warning of the day and place, when and where the said Commission shall be
executed.

In the joining of this Commission, the Complainant must first name one
Commissioner, unto whom the Defendant may give general exception:

The Defendant must name the second; The Complainant the third; And the
Defendant the fourth.

The common exceptions which be given to Commissioners are these, (viz.)
THat the Commissioner named, is of Kindred or Allied to the party, for whom he
is named:

That he is a Master to the party:

That he is a Landlord unto him:

Or a Partner unto him:

Or have suite in Law with the adverse party to him, by and for whom he is
named:

Or is it of Counsel, an Attorney, or a follower of the cause of the one party:

Or to whom the party is indebted:

Or any other apparent cause of partiality, or siding with either party.

And it is commonly used, that either party may give exception to one, and they
seldom give exception to any more then one, on either party.

And yet nevertheless, the Complaynants Attorney may if the Complainant will,
renew the said Commission also and give the like warning also unto the
Defendant, if the Defendant renew it not.

Upon the execution of either of which Commissions and return whereof either of
them may give to the other a Rule for publication, thus, viz. dies dat defend
publicat. super Commis. junct. If the Defendant give the Rule, then thus: dies
dat quer pro public. super Commis. junct.

The day so given, is one week; which being expired, and no cause showed to the
contrary, then Publication is granted; and neither party can examine any
witnesses afterward, unless it be by special order of the Court; which is
never granted without an Oath made, that the party which requires the same,
nor any of them has seen, or been made privy to any examination of any of the
Witnesses formerly examined in this Court by either of the parties: And some
good cause be shown, either by oath, or certificate of Commissioners, why the
party could not get his said witnesses examined within the time limited for
their examination.

In which case, sometimes the Court gives order to examine witnesses by a time
prefixed, with this Proviso; That the party shall not in the mean time see the
said former examination.

And sometimes the Court gives Order that the said party shall examine his
witnesses, to inform the conscience of the Judge only and not otherwise.

These Depositions are never published, but by especial order or consent of the
parties; but delivered to the Judge, sealed up by the Officer, under whose
custody they do remain, to the end he may peruse them.

If any one be called by a Sub paena, to appear in this Court: And upon his
appearance, the Complainant or any other does arrest him in any other court; he
shall have a Supersedeas to discharge the Action, because he must have free
going and free coming.

But it is not so, if the Complainant be arrested, except it be after issue is
joined, and a day is given for the matter to be heard. And the Complaynant
coming to the Court, with evidence to maintain his cause, is arrested: The
Court in this case shall defend him, and set him free to follow his suite.

But this is seldom seen: And he that is Plaintiff in the other Court, may
declare, against him here Praesentem in curia, if he please. See 37. Eliz.

If any one who has Privilege in Chaucery, arrested into another Court, in a
joynt-action with his Wife, for matter concerning her: Notwithstanding the
Coverture, she shall not have any benefit of Privilege here. See Powles case.

The Clerks of Chaucery are to be sued in this Court, either by Latin or
English Plea.

The Order made and ordained by Sir Nicholas Bacon, Knight, Lora Keeper of the
Great Seal, touching the Examination of witnesses (in perpetuam rei memoriam:)
Dated the tenth of December, in the third year of the late Q. Eliz. follow. eth.
FIrst the Commissioners shall examine no Witnesses, but such as be aged and
impotent.

Item, the Complaynant, or party, who sueth forth the Commission, shall give
warning by precept from the Commissioners, unto the party that should take
prejudice by this examination, by the space of fourteen days at the least, of
the time, and place; when, and where the said Commissioners will sit upon this
Commission.

And the same warning being so given, the Commissioners are to be satisfied by
the Oath of the party complainant, or of some other credible person that
warning is given accordingly, before they shall proceed to the execution of
their Commission.

Item, If the party Adversant, or Defendant can show before the Commissioners
good cause of exception, either against the witnesses produced by the
complainant, or any of them, or against the Commissioners themselves; or
otherwise, then they shall cease and forbear any farther execution of the
commission.

And the Commissioners shall certify and return the said causes and
exceptions up with the commission.

Item, If the party adversant cannot show sufficient cause (as aforesaid) then
the commissioners shall proceed to the examination of witnesses; and the party
adversant or defendants shall have liberty to join in the examination of the
same witnesses, or o^ any other likewise upon Interrogatories on his behalf
(if he think good.)

Item, The commissioners shall certify in their return of the commission,
such acceptations as the defendant shall take against the proceeeding in the
same Commission, and whether the De endant did appear or no?

And if the Defendant did not appear, they are likewise to certify and
return, whether Affidavit were made of the giving of warning by precept (as
before. said) or no?

Orders to be observed before the granting of Publication of the said
Commission.
THe party who prays Publication, shall first by himself, or some other,
make Oath that the Depositions of the same witnesses, are necessarily to be
given in evidence on his behalf.

Item, Oath also must be made, that the same Witnesses be either dead, or so
aged, or impotent as they cannot travel to testify (viva voce) without danger
of life.

Item This Oath being so taken, a Master of the Chancery must first open the
Commission, and consider whether this Order before mentioned has been observed
in all points: wherein he being satisfied, Publication is thereupon to be
granted.

Provided always, that no Depositions shall be given in evidence, but against
those persons that were warned by precept (as aforesaid) or against their Heirs
or Assigns.

And provided also, That after examination had, and taken (as a oresaid,) and
after Publication had, and granted of the same examinations: The party
Adversant, or Defendant, shall not be admitted to have any new examination on
his behalf, concerning the same matter.

Item, This Order is to be observed in case where the commission is ex parie
querentis only, and it is to be engrossed in Parchment, and subscribed with the
hand of the Register, and to be annexed to every of the said commissions, but
not otherwise.

Fur if the Defendant join, then these articles shall not need.

The difference used between a Joint. Commission in the aforesaid nature, and
Commission ex part follows.
THe Joynt-Commission is made in form, as all other general commissions to
examine witnesses, Super Interrogator, ministrand, be, Adding to the end of the
same these word (viz.) In perpetuam rei memoriam permansur.

This Commission ex part, is to have these rules inserted under the Registers
hand, and the Commissioners names are specially to be assigned by the Lord
Keeper, or, Lord Chancellor for the time being.

Termino Michaelis, Anno Regni Elizab. Reg. Sext.
MEmorandum, That all Injunctions granted for preservation of possession,
during the suit in the Court of Chancery, shall have this clause and condition
contained in them (viz.) That the party who prays possession, was in
possession at the time of the Bill exhibited, and certain years before; And
that his interest is not determined by forfeiture, surrender, or other lawful
means,

And Bond must be put in by the party who prays the possession, of the
penalty of ten pound, with condition that this Information aforesaid is true.

Item, That all Injunctions granted for the stay of suits at the common Law,
shall have this clause and condition contained in them: (viz.) That the same
suit desired to be stayed, is for and concerning the same matter depending in
this Court, and as were begun at the Common Law, after the Bill exhibited into
this Court; and that Bond be put in (as aforesaid.)

Item, That no special Certiorare do pass without Bond first given, on the
behalf of the party who desires the same; with condition that the Bill
exhibited contains matter sufficient to bear a Certiorare, and that he
shall prove the contents of this Bill to be true, within fifteen days after
the return of the Writ, according to the order and course of this Court.

And that upon the granting of every Procedendo the Bond aforesaid be remembered
to the Lord Keeper.

Termino Trinitatis, Anno Regni Elizab. Reginae Septimo.
The Process now is made returnable but three days before the hoaring.
It is ordered, that all Suits for no more then six acres of Land, or less,
except the same be worth forty shillings by the year.

And all Suites for matter under the value of ten pounds, shall be dismissed
this Court, for such cause only proved. And this Court shall not retain any
such: But the party who brings the same hither, shall pay costs to the
Defeudant, as this Court shall award.

Termino Michaelis, Anno Regni Eliz. Reg. Septimo.
IT is ordered, that all Process to bear Judgment, be returnable six or
seven days before the day of Hearing, and not above, saving in the beginning
of the Term, when the time will not permit so long warning.

And the said Writs must he endorset on the backside, with the very day
appointed for the hearing of Judgment. And so much for that Term.

By the general custom, and ancient usage of this Court, all Bills shall be
retainable here, in case where the Equity of the cause requires and bears
it, and wherein the common Law does afford no relief, but rather pressure and
rigor.

After Publication once had the Complainant may procure a day of Hearing of
course, by such as one of the six Clerks as deals for him. And he may at the
end of the Term, when the Lord Keeper sets down the days of Hearings,
procure his hearing to be set down amongst those assigned for the next
succeeding Term.

This was wont to be ancient course of procuring of Hearings, howsoever it was
lately dis-used and (as I take it) the same is now restored again to the good
contentment of al Suitors in this Court.

The Order of Proceeding against such as refuse to obey His Majesty's
Injunctions, proceeding and issuing out of the Court of Chancery.
FOr the breach of an Injunction, this is the course commonly.

If the Contemptor do not upon sight of the Injunction obey the same, but does
commit some Act in contempt or neglect thereof, then upon an Affidavit made of
the serving of the said Injunction, and of the breach thereof, then an
Attachment is awarded against the said Contemptor, etc. as in the case of
Process, before mentioned and declared, and so further Process to common
Rebellion and Sergeant at arms, etc.

The Modern Orders and Ordinances of Chancery follow.
Affidavits.

NO Affidavit shall be admitted or taken which shall tend to the proof or
dis-proof of the Title or matter in question, or touching the merits of the
cause.

Neither shall any such matter be colourably inserted, in any Affidavit to be
made touching the Serving of Process.

No Affidavit shall be taken against Affidavit so far as the Master of Chancery
can discern, or take knowledge, etc.

If any such be taken, the latter shall not be used or read in Court.

Contempts.
IN case of Contempts, granted upon force, or ill words, used upon serving of
Process, or other words of Scandal, proved by Affidavit, the party forthwith
upon motion will be committed, if the words spoken deserve it.

But for other Contempts, against the Orders or Decrees of the Court.

First, an Attachment goes forth upon Affidavit made.

Then the party being taken is to be examined upon Interrogatories.

His examination is to be referred, upon motion, to one of the Masters of the
Chancery.

And if upon examination, he confess matter of contempt, he is to be committed
upon the like motion.

If he confess it not, the Adverse party may upon like motion and order
examine witnesses to prove the contempt.

And if the contempt appear upon proof, the contemptor is to be committed
therefore, upon motion and order likewise.

But if the adverse party fail to prove the said contempt, or fail to put in
his Interrogatories or other prosecution, then the party charged with the
contempt, is to be discharged upon motion with good costs.

Imprisonment upon Contempts for matters past, may be discharged of grace,
after sufficient punishment: Or it may be otherwise dispensed withal in such
case.

But if the imprisonment be for performance of any Order of the Court in force:
Then the Contemplator ought not to be discharged, except he first obey: Only,
the contempt may be suspended for a time.

Petitions.
NO Injunctions, Sequestration, Dismissions Retainer upon Dismissions, or
Final Orders, shall be granted upon Petitions.

No former Order made in court, is to be altered, crossed or explained upon any
Petition: But such Orders may be only stayed upon Petition for a small time,
till the matter may be moved in court.

No Commissions for examination of Witnesses shall be discharged; Nor any
examinations, or depositions of witnesses shall be suppressed upon Petition,
unless it be first referred, and Certificate be made thereupon.

Injunctions.
INjunctions for possession or for stay of Suits after verdict, are to be
presented to the Lord Keeper, or Lord Chancellor, being together, with the
Orders whereupon they go forth; that his Lordship may take consideration of
the Orders before he sign them.

No Injunction of any nature shall be granted, revived, dissolved, or staid
upon private Petition.

No Injunction to stay Suits at the common Law, shall be granted upon Prioritie
of Suite only:

Or upon the Surmise of the complainants Bill only.

But upon matter confessed in the Answer of the Defendant.

Or matter of Record.

Or writing plainly appearing.

Or when the Defendant is in contempt for not answering.

Or when the debt desired to be staid, appears to be old, and has slept long.

The creditor and the debtor have been dead some good time, before the Suite
brought.

Where the Defendant appears not, but sits an Attachment: Or when he does
appear and departs without answer, and is under attachment for an answering:
Orwhere he takes Oath, that he cannot answer without sight of Evidences in the
Country: Or absenting himself in one private place, or beyond Sea, and cannot
be found to be served with a Sub-paena, upon Oath made, an Injunction is
usually granted.

In all these cases, an Injunction may be granted, for stay of suites at the
Common Law, until the party answer, or appear in person in Court, and the
Court give further order.

An Injunction never is dissolved without motion on the adverse part.

In the case aforesaid, where an Injunction is to be granted, for stay of suits
at the common Law; if the like Suits be in the Chancery, either by Scire facias
or by Privilege or English Bill; then the Suit is to be staid by order of the
Court, as it is in other Courts by Injunction.

An Injunction is usually granted, if the party Defendant be in Contempt, or
matter confessed, though after an arrest or further proceedings at Law without
bringing money in Court.

Injunctions for Possession are not to be granted before a Decree, but where
the Possession has continued by the space of three years past before the Bill
exhibited, and upon the same Title, and not upon any Title by leave or
determined.

In case where the Defendant sits all the process of Contempt, and cannot be
found by the Sergeant at Arms, or resists the Sergeant, or make rescues, a
Sequestration shall be granted of the Land in question, and if the Defendant
do not render himself within the year, then an Injunction shall be granted
for the Possession.

Injunctions against the felling of Timber, or plowing up of ancient Pastures,
or for the maintaining of Enclosures, or the like, shall be granted according
to the circumstances of the case, but not in case, where the Defendant upon his
answer, claims a state of inheritance, except it be where he claims the
Land in trust, or upon some other special ground.

Injunctions shall be enrolled, or the Transcripts thereof be filed.

Order.
WHere any Order shall be made against the general Rules of the Court, there
the Register shall plainly and expressly set down the particular reasons and
grounds, moving the Court to vary from the general rule.

No order of the public Court is al^erable upon Petition: vid. in the Title
Petition.

Register: Order.
THe Registers are to be sworn.

If any Order shall be made, and the Court not informed of the last martial
Order formerly made, no benefit shall be taken by such Order, as being granted
by abuse, and surreption: And to that end, the Register ought duly to mention
the last former Order in the present Order.

No Order shall be explained upon any Petition, but only in Court as they are
made, and the Register is to set down the Orders, as they are pronounced by
the Court, truly, at his peril, without troubling the Lord Keeper, or Lord
Chancellor, by any private attending of him, to explain his meaning; and if
any explanation be desired, it is to be done by public motion, where the other
party may be heard.

No draught of any Order shall be delivered by the Register to either party,
without keeping of a Copy by him: to the end that if the Order be not entered;
nevertheless, the Court may be informed what was formerly done, and not be put
to a new trouble, and to the end also, that knowledge of Orders be not kept
back too long from either party, but may presently appear at the Office.

Where a cause has been debated upon the hearing of both parties: and opinion
has been delivered by the court; and nevertheless, the cause referred to
Treaty: the Registers are not to omit the opinion of the Court in drawing of
the Order of Reference, except the Court do specially declare, that it is to
be entered without any opinion either way.

In which case, nevertheless, the Registers are out of their short Notes to
draw up some more full remembrance of that which passed in Court to inform the
Court if the cause come back, and cannot be agreed.

The Registers upon delivery of the draught of any Order, unto the counsel of
either party, are not to respect the Interlineations, or alterations of the
said Counsel (be the said Counsel never so great) further then as to put them
in remembrance of that which was truly delivered in Court; and so to conceive
the Order upon their Oath and duty, without any other or farther respect.

The Registers are to be careful in the penning and drawing up of Decrees; and
especially in matters of difficulty and weight; and therefore when they present
the same to the Lord Keeper, or Lord Chancellor, they ought to give him
understanding which are such Decrees of weight, that they may be read and
reviewed, before his Lordship sign them.

Decrees.
THe Decrees or dismissions made or granted in the Rolls, and those that are
made in Court at Westminster on Wednesdayes or Fridays, when the Lord Keeper is
not present (being drawn up) are first to be signed by the Master of the Rols,
or the Judge that sat at the hearing of the cause, and then presented to the
Lord Keeper to be likewise signed; which being done, then the same are to he
enrolled.

NO Decrees shall be reversed altered or explained, being once enrolled, but
upon Bill of Review; and no Bill of Review shall be admitted, except it be upon
error in Law, appearing in the body of the Decree, without farther examination
of matters in fact or he shall show some new matter which has risen in time
after the Decree, and not any new proof, which might have been used when the
Decree was made.

Nevertheless, upon new proof which is come to light since, and after the
Decree made, and could not possibly have been used at the time when the Decree
passed, a Bill of Review may be granted by the special License of the Court,
and not otherwise.

Also upon a Bill of Review the party Complaynant is to put in security before
one of the Masters of the Court, to stand to and perform the order of the
Court, upon the hearing upon such Bill of Review,

In case of mis-casting, being a matter Demonstrative, a Decree may be
explained, and reconciled by an Order without Bill of Review.

Where note, that by the word Miscasting, is not intended any pretended
Mis-casting, or mis-valuing, but only error in the Auditing, or numbering.

No Bill of Review shall be admitted, or any other new Bill to change matter
decreed, except the Decree first obtained, be performed: And if it be for Land,
that the possession be yielded: If it be for money, that the money be paid: If
it be for evidence, that the evidence be brought in; and so in other cases
which stand upon the strength of the Decree alone.

But if any Act be desired to be done, which extinguisheth the parties righ at
the Common Law (as making of Assurance and Release, Acknowledging of
Satisfaction, Cancelling of Records or Evidence, and the like) Those parts of
the Decree are to be spared, until the Bill of Review be determined: But such
sparing is to be warranted by public Order made in Court.

No Decree shall be made upon pretense of equity, against the express
provision of an Act of Parliament.

Nevertheless, if the construction of such Act of Parliament, has for a time
gone one way in general opinion and reputation; and after by a latter
judgment has bin controlled: Then Relief may be given upon matter of equity
for cases arising before the said Judgment: because the Subject was in no
default.

Imprisonment for breach of a Decree is in nature of an Execution, and
therefore the custody ought to be straight, and the party not to have any
liberty to go abroad, but by special license of the Lord Keeper or Lord
Chancellor being: But no close imprisonment is to be but by express order for
wilful and extraordinary Contempts and disobedience (as has been used.)

In case of obstinate disobedience, in the breach of a Decree an Injunction is
to be granted Sub-poena of a sum: and upon Affidavit, or other sufficient
proof of persisting in contempt, Fines are to be pronounced by the Lord
Keeper, or Lord Chancellor in open Court, and the same are to be estrated down
into the Hannaper by special order.

In case of a Decree made for the possession of Land, a Writ of Execution goes
forth, and if that be dissobeyed, then Process of Contempt, according to the
course of the Court, is to go forth against the person unto the Commission of
Rebellion; and then a Sergeant at Arms by special Warrant: and in case the
Sergeant at Arms cannot find him, Or he be resisted, Or if he upon his
commitment do persist in his disobedience, an Injunction is to be granted for
the Possession, and in case that it also be disobeyed, then a Commission is to
be made to the Sheriff, to put his adversary into possession.

Where the party is committed for breach of a Decree, he is not to be enlarged,
until the Decree be fully performed in all things which are to be done
presently.

But if there be other parts of the Decree to be performed at days or times to
come: Then he may be enlarged by order of the Court, entering into Recognizance
with Sureties for the performance de futuro but not otherwise.

Where causes come to hearing in Court, no Decree binds any Person, who was
not served with Process ad audiendum judicium, according to the course of the
Court.

No Decree binds any one that comes in bona fide, by Conveyance from the
Defendant before the Bill exhibited; and is made no party either by Bill or by
Order.

But where her comes in Pendente lite, and while the Suit is in full
prosecution, and without any color of allowance, or privity of the Court:
there regularly the Decree binds.

But if there were any intermission of suite, or the Court were made acquainted
with the Conveyance, the Court is to give order upon the special matter
according to Justice.

Where a Decree made for a Rent to be paid out of Land, or a sum of money to
be levied upon the profits of Land; there a Sequestration of the same Land
being in the Defendants hand, may be granted upon the Decree.

Where the Decree of the Provincial counsels, or the Court of Requests or the
like, are by contumacy or other means interrupted: there the Court of
Chancery, upon a Bill preferred for corroboration of the Decrees of that
jurisdiction shall give remedy.

Where any cause come to hearing here which has been formerly decreed in any
other of the Kings Courts of Justice at Westminster; such Decree shall be first
read and then this Court shall proceed to hear the rest of the evidences on
both sides.

Decrees upon Suits brought after Judgment, shall contain no words to make
void or weaken the. Judgment: But shall only correct the corrupt conscience of
the party, and rule him to make Restitution, or to perform other acts,
according to the equity of the cause.

Bill of Review.
Decrees are not to be reversed, altered, or explained, being once enrolled,
but upon Bill of Review.

Bill of Review shall not be admitted, except the Decree be first obeyed and
performed.

No Bill of Review shall be put in, except the party that prefers it, enter
into Recognizance, with sureties for the satisfying of costs and damages for
the Delay, if it be found against him.

Reference, Report.
NO Reference upon a Demurrer, or question touching the Jurisdiction of this
Court, shall be made to the Masters of the Chancery, but such Demurrer shall be
heard and ruled in the Court, or by the Lord Keeper, or Lord Chancellor
himself.

For the confirming or ratifying of any Report, No Order shall be made, without
day to be given by the space of a Seven-night (at least) to speak unto it in
Court.

No Reference shall be made to any Master of the Court, or any other
Commissioner or Commissioners, to he are and determine where the cause is gone
so far as to Examination of witnesses: Except it be in special cases of
parties near in blood, or of extreme poverty, or by consent.

And generally, References of the state of the cause, are to be sparingly
granted; except it be by consent of the parties.

No Report shall be respect in Court, which exceeds the warrant o^ the Order
of reference which leads it.

The Masters of the Court are required, that by Report they do not certify
the estate of the cause; as if they would make Breviates of the Evidence on
both sides, which does little ease the Court; but that they do it with some
opinion: Or otherwise, in case they think it too doubtful, to give opinion
there; And thereupon they are to make such special Certificate, and the cause
is to go on to a judicial hearing, without respect had to the same.

If both parties consent to a Reference for the examination of Accounts to make
the Cause more ready for hearing, it may be granted. But generally matters of
Account, excepting in very weighty Causes, are not fit for the Court, but are
to be prepared by Reference, with this provision nevertheless: That the Causes
come first to hearing, and upon the entrance into a hearing, they may receive
some direction, and be turned over to be considered and prepared.

The like course of Reference is to be taken for the examination of Court
Rolls upon any Customs; and the Copies shall not be referred to any one
Master, but to two Masters at the least.

No Reference shall be made of the Insufficiency of any Answer, without showing
of some particular points of the defects thereof, and not upon surmize of the
Insufficiency generally.

If a Complainant take exception to a Defendants Answer, he must deliver his
exceptions to the Defendants counsel or Attorney; and if the Defendant within
eight days amend his answer, he is to pay no costs; but if he do not, then a
Reference is to be had to a Master of the Court, and if he report the Answer
insufficient, then the Complainant may take out two Subpaena's against the
Defendant, one for twenty shillings costs, and the other to make a better
answer.

Where a Trust is confessed by the Defendants answer, there needs no farther
hearing of the cause, but a Reference presently to be made of the Accounts, and
so they are to go on to the hearing of the Accounts.

Dismission.
WHere Causes are dismissed upon full hearing, and the Dismission signified by the
Lord Keeper or Lord Chancellor, and enrolled, such Causes shall not be retained
again, neither shall any new Bill be admitted, except it be upon new matter,
like unto the case of the Bill of Review.

In case of all other Dismissions, which are not upon hearing of the Cause, if
any new Bill be brought the Dismission is to be pleaded; and after Reference
and Report of the Contents of both Suits, and consideration taken of the Cause
or causes of the former Dismission: the Court shall rule and order the
Retaining or Dismission of the new Bill, according to justice, and the nature
of the Case.

All suits grounded upon wills Nuncupative, Leases paroll, or upon long Leases,
that tend to the defeating of the Kings Tenures, or for the establishing of the
Perpetuities; or granted upon Remainder over unto the Crown, to defeat
purchasers; Or for Brocage, or Rewards to make marriages; Or for bargain at
play; or Wagers for bargains for Offices, contrary to the Statute of the second
of Edward 6. Or upon contracts for usury or Simony, are regularly to be
dismissed upon motion, if they be the whole matter of the Bil; and there be no
special circumstances to move the court to allow them a Proceeding.

And all suits under the value of ten pounds, are Regularly to be dismissed.

Dismissions are properly to be prayed and had, either upon hearing, or upon
Plea unto the Bill, when the cause comes first into the Court.

But Dismissions are not to be prayed after the parties have been at charge of
examination of witnesses, except it be upon special cause.

If the Complainant discontinue prosecution, after all the Defendants have
answered, above the space of one whole Term, the cause is to be dismissed of
course without motion.

But after Replication is put in, the cause is not to be dismissed without
motion and order of the Court: and that motion is not to be made till four
Terms after the Replication put in, and that in case there have been no
proceeding after the Replication, either by Motions, References, examination of
witnesses, or the like.

For double vexation, the cause may be dismissed.

Where causes are Removed by special Certiorare, upon a Bill containing matter
of equity; the Complainant is upon Receipt of his Writ, to put in Bond to prove
his suggestions within fourteen days after the Receipt, which if he do not
prove, then upon certificate from either of the Examiners, presented to the
Lord Keeper or Lord Chancellor, the cause shall be dismissed with costs, and a
Procedendo shall be granted.

Demurrer.
DEmurrers and Pleas which tend to the discharging of any suite, shall be neard
first upon every day of Orders, that the Subject may know, whether he shall
need to give further attendance or no.

A Demurrer is properly upon matter defective contained in the Bill it self:
or foraigne matter.

But a Plea is of foraigne matter, to charge or stay the suit. (as)

That the cause has been formerly dismissed,

That the Complainant is outlawed.

That the Complainant is excommunicate.

That there is another Bill depending for the same cause.

Or the like.

And such Plea may be put in without Oath, in case where the matter of Plea
appears upon Record, but if it be any thing which does not appear upon Record,
then the Plea must be put in upon Oath.

No Outlary shall be allowed, without pleading Record Sub pede Sigilli: Nor
plea of Excommunication without the Seal of the Ordinary.

Where any suite appears upon the Bill to be of the nature of any of those
which are regularly to be dismissed, according to the Order before mentioned
the said Order is to be set forth by way of Demurrer.

Answer.
WHere an Answer shall be certified to be sufficient, the Defendant is to pay
costs.

And if a second Answer be returned insufficient in the points before certified
for insufficient, then he shall pay double costs.

And upon the third like case, treble costs.

And upon the fourth, quadrupile costs, and then to be committed also till he
shall have made a perfect and sufficient Answer and he shall be examined upon
Interrogatories, touching the points defective in his Answer.

But if any Answer be certified to be sufficient, then the Complainant is to
pay costs.

No Insufficiency of Answer can be taken hold of, after Replication put in,
because it is admitted for sufficient by the Replication.

An Answer to a matter charged as the Defendants own fact, must be direct,
without saying that It is to his remembrance, or as he believes, if it be bid
down to be done within seven years before.

And if the Defendant do deny the Fact then he must traverse it directly, and
not by way Negative pregnant.

As if a Fact be laid to be done with diverse circumstances; the Defendant may
not traverse it literally as it is laid in the Bill: But he must traverse the
point of substance.

So as if he be charged with the receipt of an 100. pounds he must traverse
that he has not received an 100. l or any part thereof. And i^ he have received
any part of it, he must set down what part he has received.

If a Hearing be prayed upon Bill and Answer: the Answer must be admitted to be
true in all points.

And a Decree ought not to be made, but upon hearing of the Answer read in
Court.

Where no Counsel appears for the Defendant at the hearing, and the Process
appears to have been served, the Answer of such Defendant is to be read in
Court.

No new matter is to be contained in any Replication except it be to avoid
matter set forth in the Defendants Answer.
