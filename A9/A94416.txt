TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE LORD GENERAL MONCK, THE Humble Address and Thanks of
the Gentry, and other Freeholders in the COUNTY of HARTFORD.
MY LORD,
WE having by your Lordships careful and speedy Progress toward a public
Setlement been prevented in joining our intended Requests with those of other
Countyes, thought it our Duty to be more early against the sin of ingratitude
to God and your Lordship for those beginings of hope which Divine providence
has by your hand sent us; And that with much honor to those secluded Members,
who now being by your just hand restored to a capacity of doing righteous
things, do in earnest prepare to give us no factious engaged Assembly, (as of
late times) but a Legal free and full Parliament, whom (if God see good) we
hope he may have ordained to close up our Breaches, to raise up our Ruins, and
to build us as in the Days of old; Which that they may be the better able to
perform; Our humble request to your Lordship is, That you would be pleased not
by any Qualifications, or other previous Engagements to put upon them any
Necessity, save only of an honest and timely Dissolution, which by woeful
experience we find to be necessary: But as for any other Restrictions which
under color of common safety, may be set up for support of Private Interest,
and to weaken the hands of Honest Men, we hope and pray that they may not be
exacted against our Native freedom of choosing, and being chosen into the House
of Commons; Which if it be not free cannot own that Name to it self, nor give
honor to You, or comfort to Us;

Your Lordships most humble and most obliged Servants.

This Address was subscribed at Hartford by many Knights and Gentlemen, who
for the Delivery thereof to his Excellency appointed Sir HENRY BLOVNT, Sir JOHN
GORE and Colonel ALBAN COXE: Who did accordingly deliver it the 27 Feb.

FINIS.
