THE RVMP ULULANT, OR PENITENCE per FORCE; BEING. The Recantation of the old
rust-roguy-rebellious-rampant, And now ruinous rotten-rosted RUMP.
To the Tune of Gerrards Mistress.
FArewell
False Honors, and usurped Power Farewell,
For the great Bell
Of Justice rings in our affrighted Ears.
The Gripes,
Of wounded Conscience far exceed all Stripes,
Yet are small Types,
Of those sharp Payns Rebellion justly fears,
See how,
The unmasked People hiss us out of Doors,
And call us Knaves,
Because though We, Their Servants be,
We made them but our Slaves.
For since
We laid the Country wast like ravenenous Bores,
They seek our Bloods,
Because we prize, their Liberties,
But to devour their Goods.
Our Hands
We dipped in Royal Blood, to have his Lands
At our Commands,
And made three Kingdoms headless at one Blow,
The Strife
We caused was chiefly to cut off his Life,
With cursed Knife;
He that was Virtues Friend, must be our Foe.
We made
Religion do our Drudgery to base Ends,
But now we find,
They that do sow Pretenses, mow
A Harvest of the Wind.
And now
When clamorous Vengeance Calling for Amends
Begins our Grief,
Our Friend the Devil, with his Evil,
Can give us no Relief.
Go search
All Lands beneath the Suns Star-spangled Perch,
You Will find no Church
Like Ours, whilst reverend BISHOPS held the Chayr.
But those
We knew with our Designs would never close;
And therefore chose
In their steads to set up Extempore Prayer.
Poached Eyes
And words twang'd through a whining Lecturers Nose,
Did fill our Purses,
That many have Rings, and better Things,
Which now give only Curses.
And thus
Hell was our Text, though Heaven were our Gloze,
And Will our Reason,
Religion we made free of Hocus trade,
And voted Loyalty Treason.
Since We
With wicked Arms have made the Crosier flee,
Error is free,
To lay her Nets, to make weak Minds her Prize.
All Sects,
Schisms, cursed Heresies with stubborn Necks,
Corrupt our Texts,
And Crane up Scripture to maintain their Lies.
You see
The Crop-ear'd Anabaptist sowing Tares
In every Ground,
Though the Plagues of War, wherever they Are
The Church and State Confound.
So do
The Roman Noses vend their Popish Wares,
By Twylight still;
And the Quaker halfmad, though he looks so sad,
Grinds in the Jesuits Mill.
Our Drums
Did drown your Process, and your Writes; our Plums,
Bid kiss our Bums,
We sent your Laws and Persons to the Tower:
From whence
To be delivered, 'Twas in vain to Fence
By talking Sense;
No Habeas Corpus in the Court of Power.
The Gown
Did stoop his reverend Velvet to a Crew
In short red Coats,
Who many a Day, Have made you pay,
For cutting your own Throats.
We robbed
The Whole of Food to pamper up the Few,
Excis'd your Wares,
And taxed you round, Six pence the Pound,
And massacred your Bears.
But now
Dispayrs black clouds do hang upon our Brow,
For All do Bow,
Their Hearts, to their true Shepherd, Charles their King.
And We
Their Wolfish Rulers now must Subjects be
To Destiny,
And end our Juncto in a fatal String.
Then learn
All future Traitors by our Tragic Doom,
E're it is too late;
Lest when you make, Kingdoms to shake,
You Copy out our Fate.
We know
Our High Affronts to Church and State make Room
For Us in Hell;
But yet We'll Hope, till the sad Rope
Says, Bid the World Farewell.
Facit Indignatio Versum.
FINIS.
