A WHISPER IN THE EAR of Mr. Thomas Edwards Minister.

By William VValwyn Merchant. Occasioned by his mentioning of him
reproachfully, in his late pernicious book, justly entitled the Gangraena.

Micah. 7.2. The good man is perished out of the earth, and there is none
righteous among men: they all lie in wait for blood: every man hunteth his
brother with a net.


SIR, Your extreme fury in driving on a work wherein no charitable well minded
Christian takes any comfort, but rather an abundance of grief, has made me to
conclude, that you are quite deaf ou the right christian ear; deaf to all that
is good: a man (I fear) altogether without Conscience, or sense of goodness:
and that you have the use of hearing only on the left side of Machiavilian
policy: just as Demetrius the silversmith, that opposed not the doctrine of
Christ out of zeal to the Goddess Diana as he pretended: nor out of any
hatred to that doctrine, but as it tended to the loss of his craft and gain:
even so you, (as I verily fear) do not endeavor to make odious the several
doctrines and practices of consciensoious people, out of true zeal to any thing
you apprehend as truth; or out of hatred to any thing you apprehend as error;
but because the doctrines and practices of those you term independants.
Brownists, Anabaptists, Antinomians, and Seekers: do all tend to the loss of
your craft and gain: in that they all disallow of tithes, as ceremonious and
popish, and all contracted for, or enforced maintenance for ministers under the
Gospel, as disagreeing to the rule thereof: nay you have further cause against
them, for they spoil you not only of your gain, but of your glory and
domination, things dearer to you then your life: of your glory, in denying your
ministry to be successive from the Apostles: of your domination, by denying
unto you any more authority to judge of doctrines or discipline, then any other
sort of Christian men: and to speak truly, these are so^ temptations to such
worldly minds as yours, who in your hopes had made your selves sure of the
greatest part of all that was taken from the Prelates, and thereby of a
foundation of advancing the honor, and splendor, and power, and profit of the
Clergy once more in this Nation: It is confessed that such provocations as these
have not only produced such reviling accusations, as you bring against
conscientious well minded people, but a subversion of the calumniators: as it
befell the late Prelates, whose railing, reviling, and molesting of the
harmless faithful puritan, under pretense of herisie, schism, faction,
sedition, and the like, being all contrary to every man's knowledge and
experience of them: the issue was, the utter extirpation of their calumniators:
and that so lately, as might be a warning to you, and such politic worldly
men as you are; but that it is (through the wisdom and justice of God) the fate
of policy and politic men not to be warned by other men's judgments, but to
trust so much to the strength of their brains, that they fear not to trace
those very steps that gradatim brought the last Archbishop to the block,
making no conscience of vexing, disgraceing and undoing of any man, nay
thousands of men and families, standing twixt them and their unjust ends: and
this too so madly and rashly, as to make themselves adversaries of such, as
really aimed at their good, and to preserve them from those precipitations
their folly and malice labors to hasten. And this is your case with me, for I
am confident and well assured, that amongst all those whom in this your
frantic book you have named, there is not one that opposed your ways more
out of love, and seriously for your good, then I have done: for what ever you
through want of an experimental knowledge of me, or upon mis-report may judge
of me, I am one that do truly and heartily love all mankind, it being the
unfeigned desire of my soul, that all men might be saved, and come to the
knowledge of the truth, it is my extreme grief that any man is afflicted,
molested, or punished, and cannot but most earnestly wish, that all occasion
were taken away: there is no man weak, but I would strengthen; nor ignorant,
but I would inform: not erroneous, but I would rectify, nor vicious, but I
would reclaim, nor cruel, but I would moderate and reduce to clemency: I am as
much grieved that any man should be so unhappy as to be cruel or unjust, as
that any man should suffer by cruelty or injustice: and if I could I would
preserve from both, and however I am mistaken, it is from this disposition in
me, that I have engaged my self in any public affairs, and from no other,
which my manner of proceeding in every particular business wherein I have in any
measure appeared, will sufficiently evince, to all that have without
partiallity observed me: I never proposed any man for my enemy, but injustice,
oppression, innovation, arbitrary power, and cruelty, where ever I found them,
I ever opposed my self against them; but so, as to destroy the evil, but to
preserve the person: and therefore all the war I have made (other then what my
voluntary and necessary contribution has maintained, which I wish ten thousand
times more then my ability, so really am I affected with the Parliaments just
cause for the common freedom of this Nation) I say all the war I have made,
has been to get victory on the understandings of men: accompting it a more
worthy and profitable labor to beget friends to the cause I loved, rather then
to molest men's persons, or confiscate estates: and how many true and through
converts have been made through my endeavors: you tempt me to boast, were I
addicted to such a vanity, or were I not better pleased with the conscience of
so doing. Before this Parliament I was of full years to be sensible of the
oppression of the times, being now forty five years of age, having accustomed
my self to all kinds of good reading, and to the consideration of all things;
but so, as for a long time I took not boldness to judge, but upon the
approbation of some authors and teachers that had captivated my understanding
both in things moral, politic, and religious: in the last of which, being
very serious and sincere in my application of things to my own conscience, my
grounds being bad, though much applauded, I found much disconsolation therein,
great uncertainty, and at last extreme affliction of mind, the law and Gospel
fighting for victory in me, in which conflict, the Scriptures were taken in
more singly, and void of gloss, to my assistance, by the clear light whereof,
I saw the enemies I feared vanquished, which wrought a real thankfulness in me
toward Christ, which increased with the increasings of faith: insomuch as I
set my self daily more and more to do his will and that in a more public way
then formerly: Whereupon an occasion being offered by this honorable
Parliament, our minister and parish (James Garlick-hill London) being quite out
of order: I, with others, moved for reformation, in doing whereof how I
labored to have preserved the continuance and well being of our minister:
himself, and the ancient that, opposed out endeavors, I presume will testify,
but if they should not, there is enough that will, but he was a man that trusted
to policy, which in the end failed him: our next endeavors were for the whole
ward, wherein after much labor, we so prevailed, that the well affected
carried the choice of Alderman and common council men and all other officers
in the Ward: my next public business was with many others, in a remonstrance
to the Common Council, to move the Parliament to confirm certain infallible
maxims of free Government: wherein the power of Parliament was plainly
distinguished from the Kings Office, so plainly, that had it taken effect: few
men after due consideration thereof, would through error of judgment have
taken part against the Parliament, or have befriended arbitrary power, as too
too many did for want of light: but it was stifled in the birth. I was also
interressed in all the proceedings of Salters hall, whence much good issued to
the whole City and Kingdom; where (I believe it will be testified by all, I was
never heard or observed to propose or second a bad motion, nor far short of any
in prosecution of any thing that was good: and when the common enemy was at the
highest, and the Parliaments forces at the lowest, I with many others
petitioned the Parliament for the general raising and arming of all the well
affected in the Kingdom, and though that also took not its proper effect, and
came not to perfection: yet it mated the common enemy, and set all wheels at
work at home, was the spring of more powerful motions and good successes: God
so ordering things that no man moves for good, but good in one kind or other
comes thereof: and in all that I have at any time done, I ever associated my
self with persons of known good affections to Parliament and Commonwealth:
that it is my extreme wonder that any well-affected person should affirm me to
be a man dangerous: I have never shunned the light, all that I have had a hand
in has come to the public view and touch, and truly there has not been a
just thing promoted or endeavored to be promoted, that ever I was absent from,
if I had a call thereunto, and whereas I have addicted my self to know and
understand all the several doctrines and ways of worship that are extant, and
for that end have taken liberty to hear and to observe all: it is that I might
be able to judge rightly of their differences, to vindicate them when they are
wronged: and to advise them for their good: in doing whereof, I have gained
much good, there being not any (how light esteem soever you make of them) but
have something worthy the observation: and this I must testily for all sorts of
them, they are a people the most ready to render love for love, that ever I met
withal: and not apt to render evil for evil: they are all universally
faithful to the Parliament, friends to all just government, and enemies to all
unjust: but yet there is not any thing I have observed that has prevailed with
me to disclaim the public ministry, or the parochial congregations and I have
yet some hopes to see them reduced into such a condition, as that all things
thereunto belonging, may without difficulty be justified: but though I am not
in fellowship with those good people you call sectaries, yet I join heart and
hand with them in any thing that I judge to be right: and tending to the
public good: and love them as heartily as those that are one with me in
judgment: sometimes I contest with them somewhat vehemently in arguing, but it
is as I conceive for truth, and for their good: and they take it so, and bear
with me as I with them: and we meet and part in love, as becomes Christians,
nor does this hinder, but that when any difference befalls between them and
the public ministers, but that I judge as clearly in such cases, as if I had
no difference with them, for I esteem it a high part of true religion to
promote common justice: and not to be a respecter of persons in judgment,
wherein the Scripture is my rule: and that being on their side, I should take
part with them therein against my father, minister, or the dearest friend I
have in the world: and from hence it is, that when the question is about
liberty of Conscience, the Scripture tells me, every one ought to be fully
persuaded in his own mind, and that whatsoever is not of faith, is sin: it
tells me I must do as I would be done unto: I would not be enforced to the
Parish Congregations, then I must not force them to them, or from their own:
God only persuades the heart: compulsion and enforcement may make a confused
mass of dissembling hypocrites, not a Congregation of believers, that seeing
our Savior reproached not those that denied the resurrection, angels and
spirits, nay Joh. 12.47.48. etc. he says plainly (and that by authority from
heaven, v 49.) He that refuses me, and receives not my words, has one that
judges him: the word that I have spoken, it shall judge him in the last day.
Also in Luke the 9.54.55.56. Insomuch as I see no more warrant now to reproach
or punish any man for Religion, but rather that we are all bound in peace and
love to reclaim our brother from what we judge an error in his way: wherein
the best and most knowing amongst men in our days, may be mistaken; being all
liable to take truth for error, and error for truth, and therefore there is no
cause of strife or compulsion, except for mastery: then which (as I conceive)
nothing is more unchristian, nevertheless I may see a necessary use of a
public ministry, and parish Congregations, and it is my work to persuade
others therein, and not to speak reproachfully thereof, as they would not have
their way reproached: but then when the question is concerning a maintenance
for these public ministers: and that any shall insist for tithes, or an
enforced maintenance, truly in this case the Scripture manifesting to my
understanding, tithes to be ceremonial and Jewish, and so to cease at the
coming of Christ: and that to enforce or enioyn a maintenance though under any
other notion, is as I apprehend contrary to the rule and practice of the
Apostles, how is it possible but I must adhere to them therein: but then that
our public ministers should have no maintenance, therein I wholly dissent, and
as it has been my endeavor to assist the one party to avoid the molestation
of their concsciences in tithes, and all enforced contributions so have I often
proposed a way for the maintenance of the public ministers, more certain, more
quiet for themselves, and less itksome to the people, less disturbant to the
Commonwealth: and thus you may see how through misinformation: you have taken
me for an enemy, that have always approved my self your real friend in all
things I apprehended just: and thus you may see how dangerous a man I have been
that in all these public differences have done no man hurt by word or deed:
nay at all the meetings I have frequented, whether at Salters hall, the wind
mill, or elsewhere, I never heard any man named reproachfully, but I openly
showed the unfitnes thereof: always advising that if any man had ought against
any particular person, that he should make it known to those that by law had
aright to take notice thereof, and that we should be very cautious in thinking
evil of any man upon report and hearsay, especially of any in authority: The
truth is, I have been and am of opinion, that it is not good for the
Commonwealth, that the ministers should have any power or jurisdiction put
into their hands, o^ that it were good for the ministers themselves, the same
having so often proved their ruin, and the disturbance of the people, but do
conceive it more safe for them, and more for the quiet of the people, that they
be freed from all other employments, except preaching and administering the
public worship of God, according as the Parliament shall ordain, for I look
upon you as ministers ordained by the State, and so are to do as they conceive
is most agreeable to the word of God, and most beneficial to the generallity
of the people in settling whereof, you may advise, but are not to urge or be
importunate for more power then they see good, and it less beseems you to grow
passionate, and to move others to be importunate, and by preaching and printing
to labor to make their faithful friends odious unto them, and to magnify
your desires, above their own intentions, and so to beget emulations and
parties, threaten judgments and desertions, and turning the scriptures against
them and all others that oppose or fulfill not your will, as if they were
opposers of the will of God, which you take upon you to know, with the same
confidence as the bishops and prelates did, and in the very same manner, and
application of Scripture. No interpretation was good but theirs, no ministers
the ministers of Christ, but whom they ordained by imposition of hands, no
government, discipline, or worship, agreeable to the Scriptures, but theirs, no
opinion sound, but what they allowed, all were sectaries and heretics, whom
they pleased so to denominate: those that opposed them were seditious:
disturbers of the peace, a viperous brood, enemies to the state, and subverters
of all order and government, and by all means to be extirpated: if any pleaded
conscience, they conclude them obstinate, and thus it is with you expressly, so
as Mr. Edwards his Gangraena, is indeed but a new edition of Prelaticall
doctrine, with some additions appliable to the present times, and his Clergies
immediate interest: but trust me, this is extremely prejudicial to your party,
for there is no moderate Presbyterian that can excuse this, and has been a
hindrance to me in arguing for a public ministry, besides you soar so high in
dating expressions, as if you presumed upon some other way of obtaining your
desires, then by allowance of Parliament, which may loose you many friends
there, and occasion them to think they have through a mistaken compassion,
fostered a frozen snake in their bosoms, that no sooner finds heat and
strength, but falls into his serpentine hissing, and stinging his preserver,
you have also lost many of your friends abroad, by this unchristian nominating
men and women in your Gangraena, and many more you will loose, when they shall
consider that you have not taken the known Gospel way of first admonishing of
them, but upon bare report, as it were to post them reproachfully to the view
of the world, they cannot deem this as the proceeding of a minister of Christ,
but rather as a violent have to do your own work: trust me, I cannot but
impute the great abatement of your sect, the falling from you of so many
judicious persons, and the daily great increase of oaths sects, to no one thing
more, then to your inconsiderate rashness, violent railing, and adventuring on
unheard of ways to compass your ends, for when I have prevailed with some
(through debate and argument) to come to out public Churches, and to hear your
sermons, they have found there such abundance of passion, sweat, and labor,
not to beget children unto Christ, by preaching the sincere Gospel of Christ,
but to revile and reproach, and make odious conscientious well affected people,
because of difference in judgment, whereby they have been much discouraged
from frequenting those places, affirming that all the accusations you bring
against others, are expressly and visibly due to your selves if but
indifferently weighed: as where you charge others with pride, ambition,
covetuousnes, effeminacy, obstinacy, cruelty, delicacy of palate, and the
like; they have demanded of me with a positive vehemence, whether these were
not to be found in you, rather then in those you have condemned for those
vices, blaming me very much for going about to excuse the same, insomuch as I
verily believe, you have no enemy like your self, and am persuaded if you would
forsake all corrupt interests, and would consciensciously set your self to do
the work of Christ, to labor in his word and Gospel, out of a pure mind, and
not for filthy lucre, if you would make it evident by your actions, that you
seek not ours, but to win us to God, that you would thereby prevail more in
one half year toward your own comfortable establishment, then you shall in
an age by all your by-waies and policies, therefore leave them, and betake your
self to the work of Christ, whilst it is called to day: the night of ignorance
I presume is past with you: O that truth and this my plain dealing might beget
or awaken Conscience in you, and provoke you to cast of the works of darkness,
and to put on the armor of light, and henceforth to walk honestly and not in
strife and envying, but to walk in love as Christ has loved nor is it meet you
should esteem your self a Christian, until you find your soul possessed with
the spirit of true Christian love, which does no evil to his neighbor, and
therefore is the fullfilling of the Law. What though you could prevail (as you
endeavor) to work the ruin of all that oppose your judgment or ends? Would
it be peace in the latter end? no, assure your self it would be a sulphurious
bitterness and horror of conscience, and therefore sit down and seriously
consider what you are resolved to do, weigh your intentions in the even scales
of love, touch and prove them with the touch stone of love, if you would be
esteemed a disciple of Christ, it must be known by love: now love suffers
long, and is kind; boasts not it self, is not puffed up, does not behave it
self unseemly, seeks not her own, is not provoked to anger, it thinks not
evil, it rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth: bears all
things, believes all things, hops all things, endures all things, this is
that I would ever whisper in your ear, this being a balsame that often, and
well rubbed in, may Cure your Gangraen, and though at first your distermper may
cause you to loath it, yet take a little and a little of it, use inwardly and
outwardly, constantly, and you will find your disposition to alter and change
from one degree unto another, until you come to be a strong and healthful
Christian: of Saul a persecutor, you will become Paul a preacher of peace and
reconciliation by Jesus Christ, and be able to lay down your life for those
Brethren you have so much despised: then will you do as you would be done unto,
and in all things disputable allow every one to be fully persuaded in their own
minds, and then you will be sencible, that whatsoever is not of faith is
sin: you will acknowledge it is God only that can persuade the heart, and
(doing your duty) patiently wait his leisure for the conversion of your
Brethren: the same mind and meeknes will be in you, as was in Christ Jesus,
and you will be merciful as our heavenly Father is merciful: you will not
break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax; then you will see what
pure religion and undefiled before God, even the Father, is: you will feed the
hungry, cloth the naked, visit the sick, relieve the prisoner, deliver the
captive, and set the oppressed free, especially the oppressed for Conscience
sake: you will then see error in judgment or misapprehension in worship, to
be but a mote in your brothers eye, compared to a persecuting or molesting, or
the reproaching beam in your own: in a word, would you seriously set your
self to the studdy and practice of love, you would again fill your Churches,
and without the help of Jewish Tithes, or any unchristian or forced
maintenance, preaching the Gospel, would live comfortably of the Gospel and
draw all men after you.

As for those blemishes you labor by your Gangreen to stick upon me, I
believe your labor will be lost, except in the opinion of such as know me not:
but to acquit my self farther, and to free them from prejudice, to what I have
said I add thus much more.

In your 96. page, you have me in these uncharitable expressions, one Mr.
Walwyn a seeker, and a dangerous man, a strong head: truly in the mind you
were in, when you wrote this Gangreen, I am heartily glad I appeared not worthy
of your Commendations, certainly you have been extremely covetous of
informations, you seem to have sucked them in with greediness, and swallowed
them without chewing; it is pi^y an evil intent should be better served; your
informations to my knowledge of many particulars as that of Mr. Lilburnes and
others, and my self, have been such to you, as if they had been made of purpose
to shame you to all the world, I a seeker good now; whose your author? Am I one
because I know many, and have been amongst them often, that I might know them
fully; so have I been with all other judgments, but I carry with me in all
places a Touchstone that tries all things, and labors to hold nothing but
what upon plain grounds appears good and useful: I abandon all nicities and
useless things: my manner is in all disputes reasonings and discourses, to
enquire what is the use: and if I find it not very material, I abandon it,
there are plain useful doctrines sufficient to give peace to my mind:
direction and comfort to my life: and to draw all men to a consideration of
things evidently useful, has been a special cause that I have applied my
self in a friendly manner unto all: but hence it is that some have said I am a
great Annabaptist, others (upon as good ground) a great Antinomian: and you a
seeker: mistake me not, I do not esteem these as names of reproach, no more
then to be called Presbyterian or Independent; nor do J take upon me
peremptorily to determine what is truth, and what is error, amongst any of
them: all have a possibility of error: I judge all Conscienscious, and to hold
their several judgments upon grounds of scripture: to them appearing, and so
long cannot but hold them: and why any should control another, I cannot
discern: had I all the power or strength in the World at my disposing, in
cases of religion I conceive I should sin, if I should do more then in a
loving way offer my argument, and gently persuade to what I conceive is both
evidently true, and really useful: and thus have I done amongst those my
loving friends, whom you judge seekers: for though I do fully assent with them
that now in these times there is no such ministry as the Apostles were, endowed
with immediate power from on high, by imposition of whose hands, the Holy Ghost
was conferred, enabling to speak with tongues, and do miracles, in a most
wonderful manner, and to speak to all men, the infallible word of God: and
that convincingly to the Consciences of gain sayers: yet am I not thereby of
opinion that we may not make use of those things they have left unto us in the
scriptures of the mind and will of God; or that it is not profitable to follow
their examples so far as we are able in all things, for what though the effects
are now weak, in comparison of theirs, yet are they such as bring great
satisfaction with them: I have often persuaded with them that they should not
reject what they may with much comfort make use of, because they cannot find
what they seek, and for ought I know are not like to find in this world: see
now what a seeker you have found of me: I once heard you at Christ-Church,
which few seekers will do, but never but once, for I was not so blind a seeker,
as to seek for Grapes of thorns, or Figgs of thistles: and why I pray you a
dangerous man? indeed, by some real dangerous men, I have been accounted so,
some whereof are fallen into the snare they laid for all the well affected in
this City; but that ever I was accounted so by any that conversed with me, that
was a knowing well-affected man, I do not believe, and I believe I could
produce thousands of knowing well-affected persons, that if they hear I am
engaged, and do appear in any public business, though they know no tittle
thereof, will adventure odds; it is both just and necessary, and therefore you
incline me to believe that you labor for belief only amongst the weak,
ignorant, rash, or ill affected people, with whom Credit and repute is not
worth the having: well, your last appellation you bestow upon me is a strong
head, and what would you have understood by this? Would you have your disciples
stand aloof and not dare to hold discourse with me, lest I should open your
designs, and make it appear how much it concerns your corrupt interrest to
keep their heads in ignorance and a superstitious weakness: is it because I
know whose maxim, this is Rustica gens, optima Flens, pessima ridens: Is it
because my hearing is so good as not to be perverted by Glosing doctrines, or
because my smelling serves my turn to smell a Fox, or Wolf, though in Sheeps
clothing, or is my seeing so strong that it dispels the magic mists of
sophisticated art: or is it because my taste discerns the brackishnesse of
flattery, from the pure sweetness of plain dealing: or do you mean head
strong, because I am not likely nor could ever be drawn to dance after your
Pipe.

Doubtless these are the causes that any strong head troubles you;
nevertheless, as strong as it is, you see a small knock from your hard hand
has so opened it, that I can hardly shut it again, but I Will shut it presently,
only thus much, I cannot see how authority can pass over this unparaleld use
of the press which you have taken, to name in public so many of their
faithful adherents in so reproachful a manner; to tax their proceedings in
the proceedings of their Committees, to affirm and declare to all the world,
that the victorious successes of the Parliaments forces, is but the increase of
errors and herisies, that sectaries of all sorts get places of profit and
power, and be the men all in request for offices and employments. in the which,
you make your self the judge of what is error and hersie, and who is a sectary:
in all which you are as likely to be mistaken as any man: for none are such in
your calender, but such (as at first I told you) who stand twixt you and your
profit, glory and domination: so as a man may be a real good Christian, and a
most cordial friend to the Parliament, and nevertheless be exploded by you
for a sectary, or an heretic: one thing more, you, and such as you are (if you
be not changed since you wrote your Gangraena, as I heartily wish you were) do
extremely abuse this Nation, in laying the main weight of the reformation
(intended) upon the reduceing of men's judgments and practice in. Religion to
union and uniformity, whereas the main weight of all rests, in extirpating
the popish prelaticall spirit of persecution and molestation for conscience. as
the main thing that oppressed all sorts of conscientious people before the
Parliament, and since; and that which cannot fail to disturb and vex any
nation where it remains, but the truth is, without it you cannot keep your
self alost: without it you cannot compel a maintenance: distinguish a Clergy,
nor have power over men's persons by their consciences, but grant you the power
you desire, and you are master of all, and then see who dares open his mouth,
or move his pen in this argument: your present confidence proceeds from the
mist you have raised, but it is not yet thick enough, nor will our english
brains prove so muddy as to afford matter for thickning, I believe and hope it
is now at thickest, and when your hopes are greatest, you will find your self
in a fogge: to hold men in ignorance or bondage is not a work either for honest
men or good-Christians, but abhorred by both, and believe it, truth is become
too strong to admit of either in this age: and we trust the honorable
Parliament that are chosen to preserve us from both, will not fail to preserve
us, though you should do the worst you can, and whereas you commend them to the
love of God and his truth, and the hating of all sects and schisms, I in all
humility and true love to all that honor God, and desire the welfare of
England, do most heartily pray, that they may hate all persecuting sects with a
perfect hatred: all enforcing and compulsive schismatics, as the only cause
of all trouble and distraction.

To conclude, If you be so ill as your word, and bring forth such evil fruit
once every month, and that we whose names you have blasted, can find a
licencer, (as we hope we shall) that will do but so much for Christ, as yours
has done for B. We shall I doubt not, find a new way of innocculation, and
produce grapes out of your thorns, and figs out of your thistles, and fetch
abundance of good out of your evil: but more happy will it be for you if you
repent, (once a month shall I say) once every hour, and in token thereof, use
your uttermost endeavor to promote this or the like petition to the honorable
Parliament, whereby you will make some amends for the evil you have done by
this your book.

Humbly shows,
THat as with all thankfulness we acknowledge your unwearied labors to remove
the grievances and dangers of the Common wealth, so are we exceedingly grieved
to observe the manifold unexpected difficulties which at several times have
obstructed your proceedings, amongst which we conceive the differences in
Religion to be the greatest, and of most importance.

In your considerations whereof, being an affair of so tender a nature, so apt
to be mis-understood, and such as has miscarried in all former Parliaments, to
the great disturbance of this Nation, and to the great affliction of
conscientious people, we humbly conceive you have not in any thing showed
greater regard to the glory of God or greater care of the welfare of the
people, then in proceeding therein with so cautious and advised a deliberation:
giving time and opportunity to your wisedoms, rightly to understand the word of
God in that point which most concerns tender consciences, to hear, try and
examine all that can or may be said or writ thereof, and we trust you will in
the end produce that which shall be agreeable to the will and mind of God, and
to the quiet of all well-affected people.

And although your progress therein has not been with so much speed, or such
sev^rity toward tender Consciences, as some importunely have desired, yet have
we good cause to believe that you have been guided thoreinby the good hand of
God, who in due time will (we doubt not) bring you to such an issue, as neither
your selves, nor any others (well minded) shall have cause to repent, or ever
to alter.

And therefore we most earnestly entreat that you will not through any
importunity be induced to hasten your proceedings in this weighty cause
(wherein the least error may prove very prejudicial) beyond what upon your
mature deliberation shall appear to be just and necessary: there being as we
humbly conceive, no greater breach of the privilege or abatement of the power
of Parliament, then for any to do more then humbly to inform or advise you in
this, or any other negotiation.

Blessed be God though the differences are many in point of judgment
throughout your quarters, as they have been always throughout the world, and
will be so long as knowledge is imperfect: yet being amongst conscionable,
quiet, well affected people, they are not properly to be called divisions*

And though we cannot but fear there are some wicked Politicians that endeavor
by all means to make them such, and thereby to distemper and distract all your
undertakings, and to make the same advantageous to their unjust ends, yet are
we confident (through Gods protection) their endeavors shall be fruitless
(except to draw confusion on themselves) God having blessed the people in
general with a cooler spirit, and greater wisdom, then by dividing among
themselves, or not adhering unto you, to become a prey to any enemy; and has
produced universally in them, as in us your humble Petitioners, a resolution to
defend the just power and privilege of this honorable House, against all
delusion or opposition whatsoever, to the last penny of our estates, or last
drop of our bloods, beseeching you to go on with the same caution and godly
resolution, to perfect those just works you have undertaken, according as God
shall direct you, both for the manner and the season: for his way is best, and
his time most seasonable.

And as in duty bound, we shall ever pray, etc.
To conclude, if you shall do this conscionably and effectually, I am confident
henceforward you will not be able to do any thing against the truth, but for
the truth which is the unfeigned desire of him who cannot but earnestly desire
your reformation, and eternal happiness:

William Walwyn.

FINJS.
