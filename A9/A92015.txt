The sins of a gainsaying and rebellious people laid before them, that if there
be any tenderness in them, they may repent, and forsake their wickedness, and
return to the Lord, before the grievous storm of the fury of the Lord overtake
them, in which, all the wicked and obstinate ones, shall be overwhelmed.
Also a word to foolish Merchant, loose professors, and ungodly parents, who
train up their children in wickedness: Written at the command of the Lord, by
one of his servants called, John Po^^^
OVer you O ye scattered people in Barbados do I lament; O how have ye refused
to be healed! O how have ye despised healing. O how have ye despised the Love
of God, which has long and often been proffered unto you! O how have ye turned
the grace of God into lafciviousness! and like Swine have delighted in
wallowing in filthiness, your abommable practices have ye gloried in, and have
made a sport of wickedness, sporting in your dallying and wantonness, out of
the fear of the Lord, spending your time in pleasures, and in vain delights,
living as the beasts of the field without the knowledge of God, committing
idolatry, eating and drinking, and rising up to play, which thing is abominable
in the sight of God; O how is the image of the Devil exalted among you! and the
image of God defaced and utterly lost, so that there is no mark of it to be
seen among you, but the image of the Devil how plainly is it discovered among
you, even in all places where you are, the swearer by his swearing shows whose
image he bears, the liar by his lying, shows who is his father, the drunkard by
his drunkenness shows what he delights in, and what God he serves, the
deceitful man by his deceit shows he knows not the image of God, the oppressor
whose life is wicked, and whose end is accursed shows what a diveli^h wicked
spirit he is guided by, who to get to himself cares not what those that are
under him suffers, who to get of the earth into his possession, and increase
his unrighteous Mammon, (which is his God whom he serves) cares not what murder
is committed by him to fulfill his unrighteous and covetous ends, (I speak
concerning you, who like unnatural beasts have been the death of many of your
servants, by withholding from them convenient food, for want of which many have
perished under you, but his Mammon will not save him in the day of the Lord,
for that, for which (like a fool) he has ventured his soul and lost it to get,
will not purchase him one drop of cold water in hell to cool his tongue with:
and truly ye swearers, covetous liars, cozners, deceitful ones, and
oppressors, thither must ye go, except ye repent, the Devil whom ye now serve
cannot deliver you, ye he will rejoice over you when you come thither, as he
does now at your present folly, who follow him in the broad way which leads to
destruction, which ye earnes^y follow, but ye conside not that the end of it is
torment, out of which there shall be no redemption; how have ye despised the
voice of God? how have ye despised the call of the Lord to repentance, and have
hardened your hearts against the loving kindness of God, which has been
proffered to you day after day, and time after time, ye have despitefully used
those who have been sent unto you, and accounted them your friends who have
daubed you up with deceit; you have been bold for your idol-dumb shepherds, who
have been cur, sed examples to you of wickedness and profaneness, in swearing
in drunkenness, in rioting in quar, relling, in lyings in dissembling, these
men who have lived in these wicked practices are those whom ye have accounted
your friends, and for your love to these, the servants of the Lord, who have
been sent to warn you, have ye despitefully used, some with scoffs and
reproaches, some with blows and punches, and some with shedding their blood,
as I am a witness against you, and being wilfully mad, many of you have said
(when ye have taken those who have been sent unto you, and used them according
to your unreasonable wills) hang them, others have said hanging is too good for
them, and this is because they lay before you your wickedness, and declare
against your service, wherewith you mock God and dishonor his name, for if
Turks and Indians should see your violence and madness (as has been declared
to you) into which you fly forth (either before, in or after your service, if
any of the servants of the Lord come among you, would they not cry shame on
you? and think it strange that such should talk of a pure and holy God, who
act so filthily; be ashamed ye wicked ones to take the name of God into your
mouths, who hate to be reformed, who hate to be reproved, who hate to return
from your filthiness, sit down and lament ye careless ones, cast off your
garments of mirth and joy, and take unto you sackloath, humble your selves lest
ye be destroyed; for behold the day is coming and near at hand, that your joy
and rejoicing shall fly far from you, and hovvling and lamenting shall overtake
you, which ye shall not be able to fly from, for behold a storm of thunder and
great hail, and a day of terror and thick darkness shall come upon the
wicked, which none shall be able to deliver them from, neither from it shall
they be able to deliver themselves, but in it shall be overwhelmed, if ye still
continue to go on in wickedness, ye shall perish, none shall be saved but
those who repent, none shall be delivered but those who return to the Lord,
therefore return while you have time, return before the overflovving scourge
does overtake you, which shall svveep away the refuge of lies, with all who
put their trust in it, no such refuge will stand before the Lord, and vvoe
unto you that fly not to him for refuge, no place will be found to hide the
great ones of the earth from the presence of the Lamb though they cry to the
Mountains and hills to fall upon them, yet shall they not be hid, for their
refuge shall be svvept away, though ye fly to your teachers for refuge, yet
shall they not deliver you, for then will their filthiness appear, and they
will have so much need of a hiding place as you, though now they flatter you
and call you Christians, while ye are enemies to God and his ways, and ye
call them Ministers of Christ, and fight for them, yet the deceiver and the
deceived shall perish together, without speedy repentance, the blind leaders,
and the blind that follow them, shall both fall into the ditch together, who
return not, lift up your eyes on high, and behold how your iniquities hang over
your heads, as a black cloud, behold how the vengeance of God is ready to fall
upon you, vengeance in flames of fire you must expect who are wicked, the cup
of the Lords fury is filled for you, who have made your faces as brass, and
hearts as stone against the Lord; ye show by your perverseness what generation
you are of, ye are of that generation which always resisted the holy Ghost,
who always fought against God, who always reproched the truth, who always
were enemies to God, and children of the Devil, ye bear the image of him who
has begotten you, and ye cannot abide to hear his kingdom declared against,
and therefore do ye imagine a vain thing, and are gatherd together against God
and his Christ, but kiss the son lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way,
for if his anger be but a little kindled, blessed are those that put their
trust in him, but woe unto them that trust not in him, save your selves by
speedy repentance, and think not because repentance is proffered unto you,
therefore it may be time enough to repent when ye have served the Devil so long
as ye can, for verily none of you know how soon ye may be cut off, none of you
can say ye shall live a month longer, and how can ye then say ye will repent
half a year or a year hence, or more, this is the way where in the devil leads
you, ye put off repentance till such a time, and think ye will repent then, but
when the time is come, the abominable practices are beloved as much, yea it may
be more then they were before; and none of you are so ignorant but ye know that
except ye repent ye shall all perish, and consider what a sad condition that
will be, would it not make you tremble and quake if you did truly consider of
it though none now are more the objects of your reproach, and scorn, and malice,
then those that tremble at the presence of the Lord, take heed to your selves,
it is better to lose the joye of the world for a time then lose your own souls
for ever: will flattering of your selves save you? will saying that the Lord is
with you and no evil shall befall you (while you live in filthiness and
uncleanness) deliver you? will not the Lord punish you and your shepherds,
together for the abominations of your holy things? will crying Lord Lord, we
have professed thy name, and talked much of the Scriptures, and have spoken
much of thy truth, save you in the day of the righteous judgment of God, from
going into hell with the Devil and his Angels? which is a just reward for all
the wicked, nay be not deceived, ye must be regenerate and born again, or,
cannot inherit the kingdom of God; your proud hearts ye proud ones must come
down, before ye receive Christ who is humble, without whom no salvation ye can
witness, ye envious ones, your envious natures must be abhorred and forsaken,
before he who is the Covenant of God, who is love, is received in you;
drunkards, you must forsake your drunkenness and learn moderation, before Jesus
Christ ye do witness, who teaches moderation in all things, without whom ye
cannot please God; and ye who are covetous, who are griping for the earth, your
idolatry you must come to forsake before ye know Jesus Christ, who is the
Commonwealth of Israel, without whom all is accursed and ye will be left
poor, and naked, and miserable, though by violence you have enlarged your
possessions, and made your selves great in the earth.

O consider ye Merchants, who are selling that which is spiritual for that
which is carnal, who are selling the health of your souls, to satisfy your
covetous minds and are selling the everlasting inheritance to get wealth in the
earth, ye are foolish and not wise; ye have not yet learned the true wisdom,
ye have spent your time in vain, if ye come to cast up your accounts ye will
find it so, ye have lost by your trading and not gained, there is a pearl
whose price ye know not, seek after it for it is precious, and when ye have
found it, sell all ye have as yet got to purchase it, so shall ye have gain
enough, and abundance of riches, yea, the price of that pearl cannot be cast
up, therefore no longer spend your time for that which is not bread, and your
labor for that which satisfies not, but come unto him where ye may have enough
of all things and abundance of riches; for while ye come not to witness the
godly pearl, ye never have enough, though you could purchase the whole world;
but being possessed of this pearl, you will have enough of all things; truly I
cannot but sorrow for you who despise it, and think that a little of the earth
is better then this pearl, it is because you are ignorant and sottish and have
not accounted right, you have overprised that which is not worthy to be
esteemed, and have undervalued that which is alone to be prised, like Esau sell
your birthright for a mess of Pottage, cast up your accounts again, and reckon
rightly, for the Lord is coming to call you to an account then will it be known
whether ye have been faithful servants, who have gained with your Lords money
by trading: consider betimes, for he is near at hand who will call you to an
account, it will not be enough for you to say that the Lord is a hard master,
that will not save you from being cast into utter darkness, who are wicked and
sloathful servants; if there be any among you who is wise, let his wisdom
appear in preparing to meet the Lord by speedy repentance by putting away
drowsiness, and doing that which is just.

And now ye drowsy professors, who are found in the abominable practices
before mentioned, who have tasted of the goodness of God, and have made much
mention of his Name, ye are to be sharply reproved above others, for ye have
known that which others for want of the knowledge of have perished; your sin is
greater then others, your abomination is aggravated in a far higher measure
then others, for others have beenbold to do wickedly, having you for an example
to them, others have said within themselves, may not I be covetous, proud,
wanton, and scornful, for such a one is so, who has more knowledge then I
have, and thus through your looseness have ye caused the name of the Lord to be
blasphemed, yea are to be beaten with many stripes, because ye knew the masters
will out did it not; ye knew that ptide the Lord did abhor, ye knew you should
not be wanton, ye knew that covetousness is idolatry, these things ye knew but
practiced not, therefore your condemnation will be greater; cease from your
dead images which you are seeking to put life into by your subtle inventions,
your images are to be broken and ye are to be scattered, if there be any of
your former honesty, and zeal toward God remaining in you, return before the
fury of the Lord break forth to consume his enemies who trust not in him, be
ash^med of your levvdness and impudence, and take unto you modesty, and talk
not of the condition of the saints no further then you can vvitness them
fulfilled in you; call not God Father, till you can vvitness that which is
begotten of God does rule you, consider how ye have blasphemed the name of
God, while you have called him Father and Lord, but have done the works of
the Devil, consider how the way of truth has been evil spoken of through
your looseness, who have called your selves by the name of God and Christ, yet
now are found talking of and pleading for the liberty of the flesh; O be
ashamed and confounded, is this the end of your profession? is this the end of
your talk? is the liberty of the flesh that which. ye have been contending for
all this while? will God be thus served? will not he be avenged on such a
generation as this? who has thus deceitfully dealt with him; take heed ye are
not stronger then God; what will become of this chafe, when he who is a
consuming fire shall plead with it? will this abide the fire? will this stand
before the Lord? pure is his name, pure is his power, let all that defiles and
works abominations depart from him, for it cannot dwell with him, neither does
he delight in it; therefore O ye professors, who are lifted up in a dead
unsavory, and putrified profession, come down and depart from your filthiness
which ye have long lived in, or for ever you must depart from the presence of
God; ye are like tall Cedars, but your boughs will be lopped, and your
beautiful branches (wherewith you have deceived many who have admited your
beauty) shall be taken from you, then shall the old stump from whence these
branches have grown, be seen to be as wood fit for the fire; your profession is
discovered, and your nakedness is seen, therefore repent while you have time,
and it is a day of visitation to you.

And now O ye parents who have many children, consider what it is children are
given you for; is it to bring them up in pride, and idleness, vvantonness and
luxury? do ye herein discharge the duty of parents? should ye not have sought
the Lord your selves, and have instructed your children in his fear, this ye
should have done, but contrarily, you have forsaken the Lord your selves, and
wrought wickedness, and have brought up your children in your own
abominations, in pride, in wantonness, in disdain, in deceit, and whatsoever is
abominable in the sight of God; must ye not give an account for these things?
must ye not answer for your children, whom ye have caused to go astray, how
has goodness been hated by you? even so that many of you, yea for the most
part, if there has been any tender in any of your children, and if any of them
have turned, abside in any measure from following your wicked steps, then has
it been your work to smother those desires, and have cried out of melancholy,
and say that children should be merry and laugh, and such like; and thus walk
in the broad way your selves, and bring up your children to follow your own
steps; how will ye give an account before the Lord? how will you answer for
these things before him, who will punish you for these things? How many is
there among you who have been forward in teaching their children to curse and
swear, and in hearing them to be ready at it, have been delighted? have not
many of you taught your children to lie and dissemble, and have called them
good children, when they have been expert at it? O horrible wickedness! was
ever any like this? is it not a shame that such a thing should be named, much
less practiced by those who call themselves christians? will not the Heathen
who have not heard of God, rise up in judgment with this generation, and
condemn them for their filthiness.

Now to the light of Christ in all your consciences do I appeal (which does
condemn these wicked practices before mentiond) whether these things be not
so, the testimony of that seek, for that will not lie, though ye will, and is
a teacher to all who follow it, and are guided by it, but is for ever the
condemnation of all who despise and disobey it, and remember that your sins
have been laid before you, ye stubborn ones, who hate to be reformed, and now
the time is past, and ye are in the pit, out of which there is no redemption,
remember that a day was proffered to you, and that there was a time wherein it
was said to you, to day if you will hear his voice, harden not yur hearts, So I
rest.

This written to the uncircumcised in hearts and ears, who go on in the
Stiff-neckedness of their own hearts, despising the Love of the Lord, and doing
despite unto his Spirit. A sufferer for the sake of the seed of God and a
friend of Sions peace, for which I am hated by the inhabitants of Babylon, both
priests, and people prophesors and profane, known by the name, John Rouse.

A Prayer concerning such as are made Ministers by the II of man, and a n^
exhortation to all sober minded people to come out from among them.

Vhat ministry is that which is upheld by a Law given forth in man's will
contray to the Law of God, if it be not Antichristian? and whether or no their
Ministry was from God that haled out of the Synogoues, or those that were
haled? And whether Paul's Ministry was not according to what you now
persecute, who went into the Synagogues to reason with them, after the same
manner as we do now, who received not his Ministry from man, neither had
it by man, though he was brought up at the feet of Gamaliell, he counted that
which he learned there, as dung and dross, in comparison of the excellency of
Jesus Christ; and now with the Same light, your form of prayer, and form off
preaching without the power, it is as dross and dung to me, and to all that
live in the life, who know Christ to be the high Priest over the household of
God, whose Government is on his shoulders, who will not acquit the wicked,
neither shall the evil doer escape his hand; for the hand of the Lord is
streched out, and by the bareing of his arm are we Saved from all our
trang^essions, which by no other means could be done; for when I wallowing in
my blood, and no eye pitied me, nor none could cure my disease, when I went
through the vale of misery, in the cloudy and dark day, when no light appeared,
then was I following men, but darkness was over the whole earth in me, which
was my great sorrow, but sometimes hope was an anchor, that it should not be
always so, but when the flood came I was as one overwhelmed with sorrow, for
all my actings, and my prayers returned in vain; while I was acting for life,
the living suffered in me, which groaned for deliverance, and the groans of
that was heard, and not my prayers, then the Son of Righteousness appeared to
me, with healing under his wings, then he rent the vail, and uncovered all that
I had done, and showed me the book wherein all my actions were set down, that I
had acted against him ever since I was a child, and indeed I could read in it,
and knew what was written there, then was the acceptable year of the Lord God,
and the day of vengeance to the ungodly in me, then was the vials of the wrath
of God powered forth upon me without mixture, and indeed it was given me to
drink deeply but I desired that I might be spared, but it was to let me see
that I had Sinned against God, and I should bear his indignation, until he did
plead my cause, for I was condemned, but the Blood of the Son of God ransomed
me and brought me into freedom, which by no other means could be done; then he
showed me his doctrine, and writ his Law in me, and placed his word in my
heart, which is an everlasting witness for himself, and against all the world,
that their deeds are evil, who by his power has shaken, and caused all my
bones to tremble, and to stagger like a drunken man, but the remainder of
himself could not be Shaken, for he was stricken, and by his stripes were we
healed, and by his light we see all hirelings, and persecutors to be out of his
doctrine; therefore we deny them; So all people who fear God come out from
among them (least yo^ be partakers of their plagues) as I have done. M. F.

The difference between the worlds relation which stands in strife, malice and
wickedness, and the Saints relation which stands in love, life, peace and joy
(...) the Holy ghost.

The Relation which stands in destroying, is by the children of the light
deny, all such who live out of light, and out of it walk, who wear the old
garmet, whose mind is corrupt, and has a wisdom; and with it know not God,
ad has a knowledge and with it corrupt themselves, and has a humility, but
feiged, and has a worship but in the will, and has a righteousness but in
the self; nd speaks the high words but it is in hypocrisy, and has a liberty
but in the (...), where the spirit is in prison, who in Caines way is gone, and
has not a habitaion in God, whose affections are below in the earth, and serve
the lusts and the pleasures, whose conversation is among the wicked, and there
is the worlds relation where lodges the strife and the debate and deceit, and
disdain, and setting up that which God will throw down, now while this is
standing which is contrary to the light, they that in the light do walk, and
be in it, these hey deny, and Sees that which leads nature out of its course,
and what sets the whole course of nature on fire, and there the whole world
are in confusion, and all the tongues are unbridled, where power over them is
not, while that reigns which leads nature out of course, his religion is
vain, and that relation stands out of truth, but all such as to the light are
turned, See with the light (and that does manifest what leads nature out of
course,) the marriage that is honorable, and what sets the whole course of
nature on fire, and what leads nature into course, where the pure relation
and the entrance of it is received, where the self and its righteousness is
denied, and the righteousness of Christ received, where the worship of the
will is denied, and the worship of God in Spirit and Truth received, where
self righteousness is denied, and Christ the righteousness of God received, and
the former conversation put of and the conversation in Heaven witnessed, the
affections below changed, and the affections which are above come to; here is
the pure Religion known without guile, which are out of Cains way, where
the habitation in God is witnessed and seen, where the just lives by his
faith, and honoring in the Lord known, and the true humility Learned of
Christ, who is not of the world, though it by him was made, who lights
every man that comes into the world, who is man's way out of it; which
light is man's condemnation if he do not believe in it; and the relation which
is in the world (who hate the light,) is in the lust, where the perversenes
is in the love of the world, where the envy is, where the invention is,
selfeishness, crossenesse, perve^s^ness, backbiting, maliciousnes, filling
with unrighteousness, yet they have a love, yet they have a relation, now the
light which comes from the beloved Son of God, where the Love of God is
received, the worlds relation is denied, for the relation of the world
destroys and devoures, but the children of the light, which be in the relation
out of the World, live in peace, unity, and fellowship, and comfort enjoyed in
the holy Ghost, so all you that profess relation in words, and envy lodges in
your hearts against one another, and yet flatter one another to your faces, and
backbite one another, behind the back, such relations we deny, and have a
witness in your consciences against it; And all that profess a relation one to
another, and love and friendship with the tongue, and in heart deceive one
another, and cozen, and cheat one another, and lie, and dissemble one with
another, all such relations we deny, and have a witness in your conscience
against it: And such as profess religion, or worship, or humility,
righteousness, and the Scripture, Christ and the Prophets words, and live out
of their life, and live in envy and malice, and yet profess you have a
relation to Christ, and God, whom ye have not seen, and you love him, and do
not love them whom you have seen, such relations we do deny; and all such as
cry up your experiences, high notions, manifestations, as you call them,
dispensations as you call them, and live in pride, strife, and envy, debates,
derision, scorns, loftiness, highmindedness, you be out of the light and out
of the way, in corners, and out of the pure relation, we have a witness in your
conscience against those things, which lets you see what you possess, and will
let you profess no more if to it you hearken, which turns from the world and
the relations therein, for all who believe not the light, and are not to it
come, have a love, but it is in the world; and a relation, but it is in the
world, which is enmity to God, so that relation which is enmity is denied with
the light, that love which is enmity, is denied with the light, which leads to
the pure relation, which envres not, where the destroyer, and devourer is
rebuked.

THe faith of such no better then the faith of the Pharisees who only believe
of a Christ, because the Scriptures declare of him, but the faith of them who
dwell in the life and power of God and follow the Lamb who thersoever he goes,
is that faith which* overcomes the world, to believe of a Christ because the
Scriptures declare of him, is to believe as the Pharisees did believe, who were
the persecutors and murderers of the just, but to believe in the light, the
life that gave forth the Scriptures is seen, and Christ is believed in, and
here he has the witness in himself, and comes to be a child of light and born
of God, which birth overcomes the world, and now says Christ they hate the
light because their deeds are evil, and will not bring their deeds to it,
because the light will reprove them, and this is the condemnation the light
says Christ; and now it does appear them that hate the light, priests,
teachers, people, young and old hate the light, and will not bring their deeds
to the light, because the light will reprove them, neither will they suffer
other that walk in the light, and love the light, and bring their deeds to
the Light and show their dees with the light, and reprove them with the light,
because they hate the light, and them that walk in it, and cast them into
Prison, and so are stumbling at the light all sorts of people, (mark) it is the
light that they hate, says Christ, they hate the light which reproves their
evil deeds, and this light is that which the world and the teachers thereof
cannot endure to be talked off, but hate it and them that walk in it, and it is
the light that is so much stumbled at, so because their deeds are evil, and
they walk in darkness, there is a proof, for they that walk in the light
stumble not, but come to receive the light of life, here Christ's words ^s
fulfilled amongst them that hate the light, and will not bring their deeds to
the light, because the light will reprove them, for that which does make
manifest is light, so that which makes manifest they cannot endure, but would
be in the da^k, and keep their deeds in the dark as it is manifest, and says
Christ the Devil shall cast some of you into prison, he is out of the light out
of the truth, and a liar, and a murderer from the beginning, which now is seen
with the light, and trampled upon, and all that own not the light which comes
from the word, are the wicked feeds men, sowing abroad their tares, their lies,
the evil reports, and them that are gone from the light, that comes from the
word of truth, are given up to believe lies and reports, and may cry up
darkness, if you hate the light what have you to cry up else, if you turn from
the light, pittyful preaching, which hates the light, which manifests all the
works of darkness.
