BY THE LORD LIEUTENANT GENERAL OF IRELAND.
ORMOND,

TO prevent the too frequent prejudices incident through jealousies, distrusts,
and misconstructions to all undertakings, We account it not the least worthy
our labor upon the instant of our Arrival to prepare this people, whose
welfare We contend for, with a right understanding of those intentions in Us,
which in Order to his Majesty's service, We desire may terminate in their good.

To enumerate the several reasons by which We were induced (for preservation
of the Protestant Religion, and the English interest) to leave the City of
Dublin, and other his Majesty's Garrisons then under our power in this Kingdom,
in the hands of those entrusted by his two Houses of Parliament, were to set
forth a Narrative in place of a Manifest. It may suffice to be known, that
those Transactions had for one main ground this Confidence, That by being under
the power of the Houses, they would upon a happy expected Composure of Affairs
in England revert unto, and be revested in his Majesty, as his proper right.

But having found how contrary to the inclinations of the well-affected to his
Majesty's restoration in England, the Power of that Kingdom has unhappily
devolved to hands employed only in the Art and labor of pulling down, and
subverting the fundamentals of Monarchy (with whom a pernicious Party in this
Kingdom do equally Sympathize and Cooperate.) And being filled with a deep
sense of the duty and obligations that are upon Us strictly to embrace all
opportunities of employing our endavours toward the recovery of his Majesty's
just rights in any part of this Dominions. Having observed the Protestant Army
in the Province of Munster (by special providence discovering the Arts and
practizes used to entangle the members thereof, in engagements as directly
contrary to their duties toward God and man, as to their intentions and
resolutions) to have found means to manifest the Candor and Integrity thereof
in a disclaimer of any obedience to, or concurrence with those powers or
persons which have so grossly varyed even their own professed principles of
preserving his Majesty's Person and rights, by confining him under a most
strict Imprisonment, his Majesty also vouchsafing graciously to accept the
declaration of the said Army, as an eminent and seasonable expression of their
fidelity toward him, and in testimony thereof having laid his Commands upon us,
to make our repair unto this Province, to discharge the duties of our place.

We have, as well in obedience there unto, as in pursuance of our own duty, and
desire to advance his Majesty's service, resolved to evidence our approbation
and esteem of the proceedings of the said Army, by publishing unto the world
our like determination in the same ensuing particulars, And accordingly We
profess and declare,

First, to improve our utmost endeavors for the settlement of the Protestant
Religion, according to the example of the best Reformed Churches.

Secondly, to defend the King in his Prerogatives.

Thirdly, to maintain the Privileges and Freedom of Parliament, and the
Liberty of the Subjects, that in Order hereunto, We shall oppose to the hazard
of our lives, those Rebels of this Kingdom who shall refuse their Obedience to
his Majesty, upon such Terms as he has thought fit by us to require it; And
We shall endeavor to the utmost the suppressing of that Independent Party, who
have thus fiercely labored the extirpation of the true Protestant Religion,
the ruin of our Prince, the dishonor of Parliament, and the Vassalage of our
Fellow Subjects, against all those who shall depend upon them, or adhere unto
them: And that this our undertaking might not appear Obnoxious to the Trade of
England, but that We desire a firm Union and Agreement be preserved betwixt
us; We do likewise declare, that we will continue free Traffic and Commerce
with all his Majesty's good Subjects of England: And that We will not in the
least manner prejudice any of them that shall have recourse to our Harbors,
either in their bodies, ships, or goods, nor shall we take any thing from them
without payment of ready money for the same: And now that by his Majesty's said
Command, We have proceeded to re-enter upon the work of his service in this
Province, We conceive no higher Testimony can be given of his Majesty's
acceptance, or of the estimation We bear about Us toward their Proceedings,
then by resorting unto them in person with His Majesty's Authority, and
exhibiting unto them the encouragement and satisfaction they may receive in
this assurance. That as We bear an especial regard to their present
undertakings and performances, accompanied with a real Sense of their former
sufferings. So, least there should any advantage be derived unto those who
endeavor to improve all opportunities of sowing sedition and distrust by this
suggestion, that the former differences in judgment and opinion, which have
induced persons to serve diversely under his Majesty and the Parliament, will
occasion prejudice, or ill resentments to arise toward such persons as have
not formerly concurred in Judgment with others in his Majesty's service. We do
delare, that We are qualified with special Power and Authority from his
Majesty, to assure them, that no distinction shall be made in any such
Consideration, but that all persons now interested and engaged in this Cause,
shall be reflected upon with equal fervor and regard; And that We shall make
it our endeavors so to improve and confirm his Majesty's Gracious disposure
toward them, as that we will never call to memory any past difference in
Opinion, Judgment, Action, or Profession, to the prejudice of any Member of
this Army, or any person relating to it, but on the contrary, shall be very
ready to attest our good Affections toward them in the discharge of such good
Offices as shall be in our power. In return whereof, We shall only expect their
perseverance in their present engagements for his Majesty's service with such
alacrity, constancy and affection, as may suit with their late public
declaration, and professions. To whom We desire this assurance also may be
inculcated. That as We shall in the future use our utmost care and diligence to
provide for their preservation from the like hardships, to those they have
formerly undergone; so We have already employed our best industry and
endeavors for the settlement of such a course as we may (with most reason)
hope will in these uncertain times produce a constant, and competent
Subsistence for them, enabling them to make such a progress in their present
undertakings, as may, with the accomplishment of the great ends thereof,
establish their own Honor and Content. Thus much we have thought fit to
publish to the world, to furnish it with an evidence of strong conviction
against Us, if We ever swerve (to the best of our power) from the just ways of
maintaining the true Protestant Religion, the Honor and Interest of his sacred
Majesty, the just Rights of Parliament, the Liberties of the Subjects, and the
safety, quiet, and welfare of the people entrusted to our care.

FINIS.
