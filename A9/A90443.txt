THE PEOPLE AND SOVLDIERS OBSERVATIONS, ON THE SCOTCH MESSAGE TO THE
PARLIAMENT, CONCERNing the KING; 5. of November 1647.
By the scope whereof, all who will be satisfied with Reason, or with men's
practices more then their words, may have full resolution to this more usual
then doubtful Question: Whether the King, Lords, Commons, Scotts, City,
Clergy, and Officers of the Army, have sought more their own private ends then
the public weal of this Nation?
The words of the Message here follow in order.
Right Honorable,
AS upon the removal of his Majesty from Holdenby, against his will, by a party
of the Army under the command of Sir Shomas Fairfax, we expressed our sense and
the resentment of the Kingdom of Scotland of that violent action, so the
Committee of Estates of the Parliament of Scotland, finding that his Majesty is
still kept within the power of that Army, thought themselves obliged to
endeavor to know the certainty of His condition, in obedience to his commands,
we have applied our selves to His Majesty, that from himself we might know
the truth thereof, who was pleased to show us his usage, ever since he came
from New Castle, but for his present condition he really confesses he cannot,
but referres us to know it, from the two Houses of Parliament, and the Army.

Dear Brethren (we may well say) here ye express (in very patheticall words)
the tenderness of our affections toward this forlorn successor of all the
numerous race of your tyrannical Kings, of which many not being a tenth part
so wicked as this, ye have rewarded otherwise; it is a wonder that such high
minded people as ye, can so undervalue your selves, as still and always to
stoop your stiff necks, rather to the heavy manarchiall yoke of cruel
tyrants, then to pity and free both your selves and your posterities, from all
kind of slavery and misery, having now a fairer occasion and more precious
opportunity, then ever ye had heretofore, or may possibly ever have hereafter.

If ye were as just in your practices, as ye are wise in your conceits, ye
would have long a-goe either alone, when he was under your power, or since, by
advice and assistance of our Parliament and Army, rather called him to a strict
account, impeached him of most high treason, and arraigned him for all his
great abominations, oppressions, murders, and destructions throughout all
these three bleeding Nations (even from the death of his Father, until he was
catched in the midst of his sins, ripe enough for the sickle of Gods
judgments) then anywise to be so zealously affected, and tender hearted
concerning his usage since ye delivered him at New Castle, and how he has
learned the lesson of obedience to the Armies commands, now after he has
forfeited his authority, and lost his tyrannical sting.

Certainly, it may well be deemed by his usual double-dealing, that if he had
you once more under his arbitrary power, as the Army has justly both taken and
kept him all this time, until now that he was conveied away to act more
mischief; he would so remember your taking up arms (though in your own
defense) against him and his forces both at home and here, for all that is come
and gone, and notwithstanding all your kindness and tender care now of him, he
would teach you perfectly to know what he meaned and intended, when he both
proclaimed you all Rebels and Traitors, and levied such strong forces by Sea
and Land against you; and all for your refusing his popish Service Book.

But it seems, that ye (especially unto whom he has either given or
promised great offices and honorable titles) have so well learned some new
court lessons, that ye have quite forgotten your good old fashions, even to
esteem of Kings as of other mortal men, and not to idolize them, nor hide
their heinous faults, as most of our vulgar fort havetoo long foolishly done,
even to our gaeat grief, and both their and our vexation, yea, ye had rather
like the men of Lys^ra, who in their blind and supersticious zealo, both called
Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercurius, and would have offered sacrifice to them,
if those Appostles had not interrupted them, then anywise like discreet men,
who should diseerne between those who ought to be honored and respected, and
such as deserve to be tried and punished.

Have ye so soon forgotten how he made the best and greatest of you, not only
know the news, but feel the smart, that his little finger was heavier then his
Fathers loins (wereof too many of us want not enough of such experience also,
and that by all kind of oruell oppressions, in things both spiritual and
temporal; heavy taxations, persecutions, and neither hearing nor regarding
petitions, but imprisoning, banishing, exiling yea, and intending to execute
your own grand Commissioner, whom he has since preferred to be your Chancella*
(upon what terms they two best know) never observing any agreement, performing
any promise, nor regarding either says, truth or justice more to you then us,
but all in hypocisie, deceit, and King-craft, (always acting and prosecuting
what his Father devised and contrived) even by plotting, conspiring, and all
sort of Machivelian dealing, to extirpate, root-out, undermine, and destroy as
well all kind of goodness, faithfulness and justice, as good peaceable and true
hearted people.

A few instances may suffice, because not only the sight of a great part
thereof is still so clear before our eyes, but the smart of all, is yet so
recent and fresh in our memories and apprehensions, howsoever ye like unthrifty
Scholars, have rubbed and worn both all the remembrance of your lessons, and
marks of your stripes, out of your minds, and from off your backs, with high
titles, great offices, new promises, and lofty hopes: Have ye likewise rubbed
out of your memories, all his cheating of you (by means of Henderson the
great, at first one of your high Priests, and next one of his Chaplins) of all
his royal performance of that agreement which he made wtth you at Dunce-law,
and you; surrendering to him of Edenburgh-Castle, and his planting therein both
a number of our Country Papists* and abundance of our ammunition, by which
instruments and means, he made many of you so sight, sob, weep and groan (yea
and leave Edinburgh town) that ye were ready to curse, both the day of that
agreement, and the birthday of all those that had any hand in it: Have ye also
forgotten how (by his means) our Country Papists blew up with a train of
gunpowder, a Castle full of your Nobility, gentry and Ladies, in the air;
near Barwick where your General narrowly escaped? And do ye not remember how
in your last Parliament when he was present, that the one day he gave you (as
it were, a purse full of gold and jewels in the one hand, even all and
whatsoever ye desired, or at least required, but in the other hand a
Scottish-dagger, whereby he would have killed and devoured you all before ye
was aware? For at his own palace did he not appoint a dozen to kill each one a
man at one appointed hour of your meeting, even a dozen of the chiefest of you,
whom he thought were his greatest opposers, or most able, and politic, to
cross his popish and bloody designs?

Was not this bloody attempt so contrived and ordered, that your General was
the first man to have been thus treacherously stobed, and cowardly murdered,
and then as his Majesty conceved any of you opposite to him in your places to
have proceeded against you, and all the rest as his Majesty should be
Graciously pleased; even as we see Butchers do with their fat Oxen: But it
pleased God, both to discover and prevent that plot for your good, if ye have
so much grace as to make a happy use thereof, now in your great need; which (as
some of our Countrymen report) was only discovered by means of him, who was
employed to kill your General: And also of the like plot at that same time to
have been here against some of our Parliament members, which we thankfully
remember was prevented by some of your Nation, howbeit it took, such a woeful
effect in Ireland, that it still continues almost to the destruction thereof,
besides a greater multitude of other enormities, plots, cruelties and
oppressions, then either tongue or pen can express.

Mess.

Both Houses (by many professions and engagements) have declared to the
Kingdom of Scotland, that they would take care of the preservation of his
person, his just power and greatness, (which both Kingdoms have sworn not to
diminish) and the Parliament of Scotland upon the Kings going to Holdenby, did
declare against all harm, prejudiee, injury, or violence to be done to his
royal person, Therefore in pursuance of the trust committed to us, we make
this address to the Honorable Houses, conceiving it needless to apply our
selves to the Army, who we suppose are and ought to be under their command,
desiring to know from them the certainty of his Majesty's condition: And the
rather that we are informed, their are intentions in the Army of the removing
him from Hampton Court.

Observe. Whatsoever our Parliament has declared to the Kingdom of Scotland,
for taking care of the Kings person, it is in reference to that ensnaring
covenant, which ye (by means of your deceitful Clergy) fastened upon our
corrupt Commissioners, when they agreed with you to assist our forces, and so
they unjustly upon our Parliament, and the Parliament upon the whole Nation;
and yet in the Covenant by virtue of that agreement (we suppose) there is no
absolute promise nor oath to preserve the Kings person, power nor greatness,
whether he be a King or a tyrant, discharge his duty, or betray his trust; but
only a conditional promise and vow of his preservation, whilst he shows his
fidelity by his activity in the defense of our just Laws and Liberties, and no
otherwise: which if he ever did since that time, but rather more cruelly and
tyrannically used his Norman power then ever he did, we even refer the
judgment thereof to God, the world and your own consciences.

But your Parliament and Nation in stead of trying him according to Law and
justice, declare against all harm, prejudice, injury or violence, to be done
to his Majesty's royal person; as if he had been borne a Law-less Libertine,
even to do all kind of mischief to thousands, ten thousands and hundreds of
thousands; and yet never be so much as once questioned himself, or scarce
those who assisted him.

If he urged, threatened and raised cruel wars against you, for refusing
that masse-booke, which he undertoke (with all the rabble of Popery) to plant
amongst both you and us, in that his most vile and flatering Letter to the
Pope, yet extant in print: why then do not ye deal with him, as the only
party with whom ye have to do, and not trouble us with your Covenant,
Reformation nor religion (whether it be good or bad) more then we trouble you
with ours; as ye did both ingeniously prophess and faithfully promise, in your
declaration for assisting our Parliament and Nation. Reas. 6.

Have ye likewise forgotten, what love and respect all of us (whom ye now most
cruelly and unjustly both hate, and stir up our enemies to persecute) did bear
unto you, not only by our former Parliament, who absolutely refused him all kind
of aid and assistance to come against you, but likewise, by our unanimous
choosing rather to undergo his highest displeasure (according to our free and
rational principles) then to take up arms to assist him in that unjust
quarrel.

Besides, in that Declaration, ye acknowledge that we have been your nearest
and dearest friends, being willing and ready to help and assist you in all your
straits and extremities: and therefore if ye either suffer or cause us to sink
in such miseries ye protest there; that ye not only betray our safety but your
own (as standing and falling together) and so ye there conclude, that ye will
do to us herein as ye would be done unto: and in diverse of your other
Remonstrances and Declarations, ye thankfully remember great aid and
assistance which ye have receved of us; chiefly, at the expelling of the French
out of your Nation in the days of your Queen Regent, which favors ye vow
and Imprecate never to forget.

Now, seeing ye thus confess, profess, protest and promise, both to our
great credit and your own great comfort, what Neighbourly kindnesses ye
have received of us, and what respect therefore ye owe unto us: whence then
comes this great change, both of your affections, resolutions, words and
actions? cannot ye rest contented with your own misery and slavery, and not
like Satan to tempt or inslave others? For it seems to us, that ye love such
unworthy conditions better then either your lives or estates, and have almost
these nine years both adventured the one and consumed the other, in pretending
to fight against a a cruel tyrant, and yet all this time intending to fight
for a cruel tyrant (as ye too well taught our deceitful Parliament) and that
ye and your posterity may be still henceforth, as ye have been always
heretofore, not only his and his predicessours slaves, but as he uses you, so
ye may still use (or rather abuse and enslave) all the poor people under you,
after that lamentable and base example of France.

Doubtless, ye are a hundred-fould worse (as well in this respect as in many
others) then the Isralits in the days of Samuel, who lusted to have a King
like other Nations; for they not yet feeling the evils and inconveniences
which would accompany a King, though they had sufficient notice given them
thereof by the Prophet; but ye have enough of such greevous and lamentable
experience already your selves, besides what ye (both as eye and ear
witnesses) well know both we and Ireland have; even that he (who is now your
best beloved Country man) has most cruelly exercised (at least) all the
grevous oppressions which Samuel fore-tould of King Saul; and therefore,
except he repent, as God gave that wicked King in his anger to Israel, and
took him away in his wrath; so doubtless he gave; and will take your King,
whom ye still both respect and endeavor to excuse and defend in all his most
heinous Sins, Abominations, Murders, Injustices, Tyranies and oppressions; far
exceeding either Saul, Jeroboam, Ahab, Ahaz, or Ammon, if not all of them.

Yet notwithstanding all this, ye (like wise merchants who take and keep all
advantages against unskilful customers) still hold so fast and stick so
closse to your bargain, which ye made with our corrupt Parliament, when ye
saw them in such a straight, that they were in fear and danger of both their
lives and estates, by his wicked means, and their own unjust dealings; and
that even besides your hyre and wages, ye (by the device, means and
assistance of the chiefest incendiaries of all these bloody wars, even your
ambitions, covetous and pernicious Clergy, confederating with ours) most
unjustly procured your deceitful Covenant to be both taken by our Parliament,
and forced upon the whole Nation; and consequently your humane religion, under
the color of reformation; though it passes the limits and bounds of all their
Commissions or abilities; seeing thereunto they never had the consent of the
free people of this Nation who both chused and trusted them; yea and are like
to be called to an exact and strict account by them, both for these and many
hundreds more of other wrongs, treacheries and acts of Injustice; especially,
in that they would not call him to an account for all his tirranny and
wickedness, exercised over the free people of this Nation, since the beginning
of his Reign, nor deal with him according to his deserts; neither before
these wars began, nor when they began, nor yet ever since they have been,
(though they might oftentimes) and so to have prevented both the effusion of
much blood and the destruction and wasting of manifold treasures and estates:

And howsoever ye Commissionars, in pursuance of the trust committed to you, by
those that sent you, will make your adresse only to our Parliament, conceiving
it nedlesse to apply your selves to the army, who ye suppose are and ought to
be under the Parliaments command; yet ye are to consider, that the Parliament
are but the Commons of Englands servants, as well as the Army; as ye know
Prophets and Priests of old, or Bishops and Ministers of late, are not
superiors to Kings (in temporal matters at least) though they be employed by
the people, to put the Croun on their heads, and take their Oaths for the
faithful discharging of their Offices; yea and in regard our Parliament have
run themselves over head and ears into so manifould gulfes of injustice, that
they nither deserve the title nor respect which is due to a Just, discreet,
faithful and careful Parliament: and and therefore they now lie (as it were)
prostrate on their knees, as well at the mercy of the Commons of England as
your good King does at this present; so that all their subtle propositions and
treaties with him, nor yet the City, Clergy, nor corrupt Officers of the Army
to help them, will neither avail nor prevent the fearful Interrogatories,
which possibly and speedily may be demanded of either; then ye will have
ocasion to take up such a mourning and lamentation for your good King, who has
so advanced your glorious Reformation, as both Jerem. the Prophet, and all
Judah with the singing women, did for the death of good King Josiah, in the
Valley of Megiddo.

Mess. The Kingdom af Scotland finding that their stability, and happiness
does so much depend upon the safety and preservation of his Majesty's royal
person, etc.

Obser. Now, ye having both expressed your own fervent desires and sincere
affections toward your good King, have also endeavored to make our Parliament
and Nation do the like: ye come in the third place to show the cause of all
this great business; namly, whereupon your stability and happyness does so
much depend; which ye attribute to The safety and preservation of his
Majesty's royal person.

It is a wonder, that ye should either be so ignorant or void of shame, as to
express so impudently and evidently such vile untruths, flatteries and
contrarieties, even against both your own experiences, understandings and
consciences, chiefly in these late and sad days, both of your affliction and
ours, which ye well know has been all by his means; being a most cruel
scourge to plague both you and us for all our heinous sins, as Nebucadnezar was
in punishing Israel for theirs: and therefore ye (upon that sandy ground of
your own humors and conceits,) do run the hazard of the following
resolution.

Mess. And being resolved that no alteration of affairs shall ever separate
them from that duty allegiance they ow unto him, nor from their constant
resolvtions to live in all loyalty and obedience under his government, have
often shown their earnest desires, and contributed their utmost endeavors,
toward the composure of these unhappy differences.

Ob. Here ye would say, if dissimulation would permit you, no wickedness,
oppression nor tyranny that he and all his hellish Cavaliers, bloody papists,
profane Countiers, flattering favorits, and domineering Bishops, can commit,
shall ever separate you from the performance of that duty of Allegiance ye owe
unto him, and constant resolusion ye have to live in all loyalty and obedience
under his government, and that ye have been very active toward the composure
of these unhappy differences.

All which words may perhaps feed the fancy of the simple and ignorant
multitude, who are always ready to be deluded by such means, but they will
never savor nor smell of any goodness, justice, nor integrity to any
impartial discreet, or judicious men: because they proceed either of very
weak or corrupt principles, of a slavish disposition, or blind affection,
without either sense, reason, due, or true satisfaction, though ye make him
(as it were) your joy and your Crown

Mess. And the Houses of Parliament having by their Votes of the 26th. of Oct.
last, intimated to us their resolusions to apply themselves to his Majesty, and
that they are preparing Propositions to be tendered to him; We do desire that
they may be expedited and communicated to us; that according to our many
engagements and relations there may be still a conjunction of councels, in
those things that are for the common peace, and joint interests of both
Kingdoms.

And for the better asserting of them, for clearing his Majesty's doubts, and
for the giving, and receiving muturall satisfaction: We do desire (in the
name of the Kingdom of Scotland) that there may be a personal Treaty with the
King, as the best and rediest means to obtain the joint desires of both
Kingdoms; And for that effect, that the King may be invited to come to London,
with that honor, freedom, and respect due to his Majesty, or (at least)
remain at Hampton Court, and not under the power and constraint of Soldiers,
where both Kingdoms may make their free applications to him, without any
danger of such stop, or affront as has been already committed against a
Commissioner of Scotland: and for which no reparation has bin made, and that
his Majesty be no more carried about with the Army at their pleasures. etc.

Here is still a continued course of great businesses (as well now after, as it
was throughout all the wars) of addressing of Parliaments and states, as well
English as Scots, by Propositions to be tendered to him, with all expedition,
and communicated to you for unity and peace sake; as if judges should present
petitions, and offer conditions* of peace unto such malefactors as stand guilty
at their Bar.

2. Ob. And for the better etc. Here is a great deal of stuff to little
purpose, truly it is a pity ye were not as discreet as ye would appear to
be; by means of your Priestly generation, ye are still of such a strange
disposition, that although ye do resort to all Nations your selves, yet ye
will permit none to dwell among you, who are more able or better principled
then your selves, and might possibly instruct you, both in spiritual and
temporal freedoms, better then all your teachers and Lawyers: witness your
hard usage from time to time, (chiefly in the first three years of your late
troubles) what numbers of our people resorted amongst you, thinking there had
been some hopes to have made you a free-principled, discreet and absolute free
people, and not to be carried away neither by wicked Kings, nor time-serving
Priests; but some of our people, as well as your own, had imprisoning instead
of reasoning, and both of them bad entertainment for endeavoring your good.

And concerning the Kings coming to London, do ye not know, he may come
thither, with that honor, freedom and respect which is due unto him, and yet
with little content either to himself or to you?

Ye make so much of a dissembling Absolon, a cruel murderer, and bloody
tyrant, as we have great cause to be jealous, that ye have left your first
love which ye appeared to have, and that ye have not such a measure of
discretion as to discern between good and evil, nor between those that lash,
whip and scourge you, yea, and both makes you gather straw, and perform your
whole task of bricks too; and those who tell you the truth for your present and
future good, ye both persecute even with a deadly hatrered, and endeavor more
to force your Religion by the sword, then anywise to convince by the word; so
that if neither sword nor pestilence can humble you, God has both famine and
other judgments which doubtless will do it.

Mess. These we conceive to be the most probable and effectual means for
attaining a happy peace, settling of Religion, restoring his Majesty to his
just Rights, and continuing, and strengthening a good understanding betwixt
these Kingdoms, which are most earnestly desired by the Kingdom of Scotland,
and shall be constantly and faithfully endeavored by etc.

Obs. If ye conceive that these corrupt courses, which so tend to justify the
wicked and condeme the just, are the most probable and effectual means, for
obtaining these your ends; yea, and being so contrary to your just
protestations against his proclaimations, and your taking up arms against his
forces; we desire that ye would either show how this can be possible; or how
this your great and sudden change comes, or else, acknowledge your error
herein; seeing there is neither any beginning nor appearance of repentance in
him, notwithstanding all his deceitful Protestations and bloody wars in all
the three Nations: otherwise, ye will both incur blame, and come short of
obtaining a happy peace, restoring him to his just rights, and both continuing
and strengthening a good understanding between these Nations, though it be
never so much both desired by you and endeavored by your Commissioners in your
behalf.

But supposing ye cannot show how such a thing is possible, we will endeavor
therefore to show you, how far ye have both changed your minds, and in our
apprehensions, degenerated from the perfect rules of equity and justice in two
years time, that ye may learn to lay a more solid foundation where upon to
build your stability and happiness, then on the sandy foundation of the safety
and preservation of a wicked man's person, though of never so great a majesty
and royalty (as ye say) and by such corrupt flattering and deceit full means,
yea, and unjust terms and titles, to justify and protect him in all his
wickedness, both against your selves and us: we send you back again, to read
and consider once more, your own general assemblies Remonstrance, published to
the view of the world, June 12. 1645.

Chiefly page 3. line 16, 17, 18, 19. and page 5. line 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 23. and page 6. l. 19, 20, 21, 22. The words are these;

When we call to mind, that God accepts not the persons of men, and that the
greatest are not to be winked at in their sins; we make bold to warn your
Majesty freely, that the guilt which cleaves fast to your Majesty, and to your
Throne is such, as (whatsoever flattering preachers or unfaithful councellers
may say to the contrary) if not timely prevented, cannot but involve your self
and your posterity under the wrath of the ever-living God, for your being
guilty of the shedding of the blood of many thousands of your Majesty's best
subjects, and for what other causes your Majesty is most conscious, and may
best judge and search your own conscience^.

Now having paraleld your present practices with your former judgments, even
of late days, whereof at first we esteemed more highly, then either then or
since, howbeit it does now clearly appear, that ye have not been sound at all
howsoever we as all Christians ought to take every thing' in the best or most
charitable sense, until time discover men's intentions by their actions,
according to our Saviors rule, to know the Tree by the fruit; for instance, it
appears plainly to us now, even by your practices ever since, that in your
little Book called Your lawfulness of coming into Eng! a ad, Reas. 6th. Ye
have either a bloody or (at the best) a compulsive intention, to root out, or
at least to compel all of what soever degree, estate or condition, to be one
with you in Religion, by which unjust resolutions, do ye not presume above what
is meet, and even usurp the work both of Gods word and Spirit?

If this kind of dealing, be any-wise a doing as ye would be done unto, we
refer it both to your aforesaid declaratian, and to your own consciences;
for if ye would not be pleased, that any person or state should urge and beat
you from your Religion, why then dare ye presume to urge or beat either us
from ours, or any others from theirs; but still to do as ye would be done
unto, for whatsoever measure ye give, the like ye shall receive.

And have ye forgoten, is it so out of your minds, that ye began all these
bloody wars, against your good King, in the very same quarrel? was it not
because it was his Majesty's Royal and gracious pleasure, to compel you to
serve God by his Bishopes and Popish book, otherwise then ye were persuaded,
or at least accustomed? And if so (which ye cannot yet deny, because it can be
so abundantly proved) why then will ye be so arrogant and wicked, as still to
prosecute such an un-godly attempt, and persecute honest and peaceable people?
but rather to learn of Christ, to he meek, humble and lowly, endeavoring
always to convince by the word, but never to force by the sword.

Again, it cannot be denied, but even thankfully remembered, that ye not only
lent us your helping hand, even a powerful army, whereby ye forced a
Parliament to be called among us, when our King made it no less then treason
to mention a Parliament (being then in the highest of his norman tyranny and
malice against our birthrights and liberties) but likewise, ye continued your
army a whole year with us, until ye set us in a right Parliamentary posture;
and saw both wicked men punished, and just men advanced before ye departed,
yea and ye went all away with as great honor, credit and respect as (we
suppose) such a great army in any foreign Nation ever did.

Upon which ground, and that ye have been always esteemed a valiant people,
and an unconquered Nation howsoever ye be in bondage to your Kings) and did
carry your selves wisely in all the particulars of your own defense against
the Kings power and forces, we called you into our Nation with an army to help
and assist us against the King; and in the first place ye took in New- Castle
again from his forces, and sent us Coals both of your own and from thence,
for our moneys; when many had begun to burn bed-steeds and tables above the
space of too years, for want thereof:

But herein was your failing, ye began and ran well but who did let you that
ye would not go on to the end of your races, why would ye not be as careful
to assist our forces and discharge your own duties in all other places and
services since, as ye were to exact your arreares, and so to have made a
speedier end of these wars.

Howsoever, upon this view of mutual duties and favors thus given and
received; it is our earnest desire, for a better union between us, then either
such a Covenant or kind of religion can make, that there may be no further
pursuance of us, in a coercive way unto either, more then we endeavor against
you in what we profess or practice, but that LOVE, which is the greatest
Commandment of all, may begin and increase again between us as brethren,
friends and neighbors, and so continue throughout all generations.
