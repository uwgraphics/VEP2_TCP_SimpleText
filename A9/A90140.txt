Oliver Cromwell's GHOST. At St. James's.
My Power once was dreadful to all,
Corruption was not known nor did I fall,
Into the Vices of the present Age
But boldly did my Enemies engage.
Cowards could never have my Approbation,
Nor Villains live on the Spoils of the Nation,
I did not enrich my self or Family,
Although I lived so Great, Poor did I die.
THE Ghost of our once famous Protector, appears on every occasion to frighten
our corrupt M -- s, and has drove them from the Spot whereon they have acted
all their Villainy: The Fox now finds his Cunning no longer of any Avail, the
old Salmon Woman has retired into the Country, so has Bardoiph, and among all
the Caball there is only Lovegold and his Son Aquepulco, that dare visit the
Lion, who unwilling to lose their Places; and to be called to Account for their
past Behavior, endeavor all in their Power to Influence the Lion in their
behalf. But the Ghost of Old Oliver is continually reproaching them with their
Crimes, and Spiriting up all true Britons to revenge their Country's Wrongs, by
telling them how he acted in his Time, that he never ^orgave any one that
behaved ill, that he always having the Interest of the Nation at heart, was
continually seeking every Opportunity to Aggradize her, that he so well
succeeded as to cause her to be respected by all Nations, that although he was
an Usurper, he feared not to put Arms into the Peoples Hands, as knowing well
however they might Quarrel among themselves, yet on an Invasion they would all
unite to oppofe any Invaders. That as the late M -- y had acted in a contrary
Manner, and seemed on every Occasion to endeavovr to enslave their Country, he
hoped to see them brought to Justice for their Villainy, and an Upright set of M
-- rs appointed in their Room, who will behave in a manner Reverse to the
Former. The Great Man who presides over all, has these Lessons every Night from
the Ghost, whose Admonitions, set afide all the evil Impressions Lovegold and
his C^bal infuse in the Day, and it is not doubted the Ghost will succeed in
his honest Endeavors, and that all Delinquents will be brought to Punishment,
and all wrongs redressed within the hope of all true Lovers of their Country.
