ORMONDS CVRTAIN DRAWN: In a short Discourse concerning Ireland; Wherein his
Treasons, and the corruption of his Instruments are laid bare to the stroke of
JUSTICE.
CIVILIS, a person of reputation, having in London met with DECIUS ( a
Gentleman of Ireland, and formerly of his most intimate acquaintance) being not
satisfied with one single sight of him, having long thought he had suffered
with those many thousands of English that were destroyed by that bloody
Rebellion; desired him if his leisure would permit, to go along with him to
his house in Westminster, where he might learn of him, how it had fared with
him, since he had last the happiness to see him, and what occasions drew him
into this Kingdom.

DECIUS accepting of the invitation, and by the way as they went, accusing his
ill fortune that had brought him to the first sight of him by chance: And
CIVILIS (according to his wonted manner) returning his civility with interest;
they arrived at the place which CIVILIS called his own: And being entered, and
having sat some while together, MARCUS a Gentleman of quality, and friend to
CIVILIS, comes in to them; who (thinking they were private) would have as soon
retired, had not his friend called to him, and invited him to sit down by
them, and then spoke to him after this manner.

This Gentleman pointing to Decius, being lately come out of Ireland, Civilis.
and one whom (for the particular friendship between us) I thought I might be
bold with: having done me the favor to come so far out of his way as to this
house; I was curious to enquire of him the condition of affairs in that
Kingdom: And having newly begun to inform me as you came in, I am sure I
shall not wrong you, if I desire you to partake with me; and I hope I shall
trespass as little upon my friend, in desiring him to proceed in his relation,
seeing by your arrival he shall have one witness more of his skill in
Elocution. MARCUS thanking his friend CIVILIS for the favor he had done him:
And both of them strengthening each others persuasions, that DECIUS would take
that pains upon him: He spoke to this purpose.

Though my imperfections might in some measure excuse my disobedience, Decius.
and the sadness of those things I have both seen and suffered, might affright
me from the remembrance of them: I shall readily overlook my self, and apply me
to fulfill your commands, where the pleasure I shall receive in obeying of you,
may counterpoise all inconveniences whatsoever. You may remember CIVILIS (as
this Gentleman came in to us) I was telling of you, How happily the English
were every where seated in Ireland, how they were spread and sown in all parts
of the Kingdom; how the Irish were every day obliged and enriched by them, and
brought by their converse with them to a greater degree of civility then they
were thought capable of; and (to make the happiness of the English seem
complete) what hopes they had conceived, and what sure grounds they had built
their confidence upon, of a lastingnesse and stability in that their good
condition: I doubt not but you will pardon me this fault, if (not to hold you
long) I proceed where I left off, and not go backward to the particulars I then
mentioned. CIVILIS and MARCUS both content to ease him of so much trouble;
DECIUS continued his speech as follows.

At the beginning of that bloody Massacre (which I hope for ever will be
remembered, to the shame of those that were the Authors and contrivers of it, as
well of the actors, and the glory of that God, who by sparing us a remnant, has
kept us from being like Sodom, and being made like unto Gomorrah:) at the
beginning (I say) of that most horrid Rebellion, I was at my own house in the
Country, some threescore miles from Dublin; where (I may say without boasting)
I enjoyed my share of the comfort which God bestowed upon me, in common with
the rest of my brethren over the whole Kingdom.

For seven or eight miles round the place where I lived, the Inhabitants were
all English and good Protestants, so that that place might with more right then
the other, have been called the English Pale; me thought it was the only
place (if any) out of which Saint Patricke had banished all venomous creatures;
for the rest of the Kingdom, we have found he only took the poison out of the
earth to plant it in the Natives (as our Savior gave leave to the Devils
(having cast them out of the man) to enter into the Swine.) Whilst we lived in
this happy condition (as we esteemed it) my little fortune (as generally that
of the whole English over all the Kingdom,) being never in so good a posture,
and with Gods blessing, every day more then other increasing upon our hands. On
that never to be forgotten three and twentieth of October, when we were (as it
were) buried in security, and thought of no ill, either of doing it to others,
or receiving it from them, especially from the Irish, (who we thought were tied
too fast by the many favors and courtesies of the English, constantly and
without weariness done to them) to cast those pleasant cords behind their
backs, and to embrew their hands in the blood of those that had filled those
same hands with so many and good deeds. Truly Sirs, as often as I think of it,
I am almost out of my self, and stand amazed at the depth of that wickedness,
that reached deeper then hell it self, at which the very Prince of the Devils
could not but be astonished, being outdone in his own trade (though he were a
murderer even from the beginning.) Whilst, I say, we were in this pleasant
sleep, we were suddenly awaked with the noise of war, or rather, with the
hideous outcryes of our poor Neighbors, who in vain poured out their breath
to preserve their lives. Alas poor creatures, they thought they had to do
with such as themselves (whose ears were never shut to any that called to them
in their misery) but they were in the paws of Lions and Tygars, or what is
worse, they were in the hands of Wild Men (if I may call them men.) The flesh
of the Protestants might possibly turn the edge of their swords and skeines,
but it was impossible for their prayers or tears to turn their hearts. You
have read of the Savage Canibals in the Indies, that having taken their enemies
in battle, delight to besmeare their bodies and faces in their blood; and
having eaten their flesh, carry about their arms and legs upon their shoulders
in triumph: In that posture (having barbarously Ravaged up and down the
Country) and wearied, rather then satisfied themselves with killing) with their
hands and weapons dropping wet in the blood (not of their enemies taken in
battle, but of their neighbors and friends surprised asleep, or at their
honest labor) they entered my house, and having sacrificed my two sons, who
were the first they met with to their accursed fury, they ransackt every corner
at their pleasure without fear of resistance, having before slain my
menservants in the field, when they expected no such wages: My Wife, three
other children and my self, sought out a place to hide us in, but all in
vain, for we were soon found out, and having stripped us as naked as by this
time they had made every room in the house, they brought us into a field hard
by, and joined us to a great company of other afflicted souls, whom they had
served in the same barbarous manner, and (that there might be variety in their
mischief) reserved for a more lingering end: It was then in the extremity of a
winter, that for sharpnes and cold, had not its like in many years before in
that Kingdom. I shall forbear both for your sakes and my own, to set before
you the lamentable complaints and the dying groans of many a poor soul that
(as we were hurried up and down to be witnesses of their barbarous cruelties
inflicted upon many thousands) through the extremity of the weather, were
starved to death; amongst whom, my three children (the eldest not above eight
years old) gave up their last breath in the arms of their almost dying Mother.

I have so sharp a feeling of the misery which you could not choose but suffer,
Civilis.
being in this condition, that I long impatiently to be freed from the torment
I endure in your particular; I pray you therefore make what haste you can to
bring me out of it, by letting us know how at length you escaped those so great
dangers; for indeed I can hardly yet believe you are safe (though I see you
here) unless you tell me you are so.

I cannot but thank you for your fellow-feeling of my sufferings, Decius.
and to free you from the torment you are pleased to say you endure, I shall
pass over those monstrous, unheard of cruelties which I saw with these eyes,
whilst I was carried about from place to place, with many hundreds more of my
brethren, who drank all of the same cup with me: and I am induced the rather to
do it, in regard there are so many who have given large and true Relations of
them, whose pains therein may appear to after Ages, like so may Night pieces
amongst the Monuments of this Nation: And I hope will be believed by all,
though in themselves almost incredible; and though many do their endeavor to
cast a veil over them.

The evidences of their cruelties are so many and clear, Marcus.
that I think there is none so ignorant that is not acquainted with them, and
none (I presume) will doubt of them, but such as inwardly wish they had been
greater; and yet I confess there are many even amongst our selves, that are
not afraid to tinter their charity, so far as to think they would not have
done what they did but upon urging and pressing necessity: Bishop of ^ssory his
discovery of Mysteries.
That they poor people for fear of their Religion and being driven our of the
Kingdom were forced to do what they did.

That our adversaries should daub over the matter so, Decius.
were a thing only to be admired, by such as think the action so glorious and
beautiful that it needs no art or paint to set it off; but that such as
profess the Protestant Religion should make use of so monstrous and vile a
color, and labor to lay an imputation upon their friends to acquit their
adversaries, is a thing not at first fight to be understood, and may very well
stumble an honest man, did he not look more nearly as well into the men as
their doctrine, I shall not trouble my self or you to confute so malicious an
imputation, being as sufficiently known to be false, as it renders the Authors
corrupt and scandalous.

When I mentioned that saying of those men, Marcus.
I did it not to ground any opinion of my own upon it; when I first heard of
it, (I Will assure you) it moved not so much my belief as my admiration, and
thefore you may well spare your confutation of it, it is enough but to repeat
it. I could not see in my weak reason what fear they could conceive of a
design to root out their Religion by force, when I knew the constant opinion
of all Protestants in all Ages, abjured violence in matter of faith, as a thing
worthy only of the Whore of Rome, who shall be destroyed (if ever) by the
breath of Gods mouth, that is, by the preaching of the Word, and not by drawing
of the Sword: Besides this, I remembered it was a charge against the Governors
of that Kingdom, that they connived too much at the exercise and increase of
Popery there, so that they could have no cause of fear from any thing done
against them at that time: And for the Parliament after, they never (before
that Rebellion) desired more either here or there, then the execution of the
Laws which were already in force against them; from which they ought not to
free themselves by the sword, or a general Massacre: And for that other part
of the excuse, or rather accusation concerning their estates, that they were
forced to take that course, least they might have been rooted out: If there
were any grievances by Ministers, the way for redress was open, and they might
have been their own Judges; the Parliament then sitting at Dublin, wherein
they themselves had the swaying vote, and might have done themselves the
highest right that could be desired; so that I could not see how they had any
thing to fear on this side either: Besides all this, I have heard that
immediately before the breaking out of the Rebellion, they had many graces
afforded to them by the King, which might have secured them for ever from the
thought of the least oppression.

You say right Sir, Decius.
there were many graces (as they called them) bestowed on them, and such, as
(for their largeness) were very much wondered at by all that wished well to the
good of the English in that Kingdom. The Irish in those graces had near upon
a third part of the Kingdom freely granted to them, and the English wholly
excluded from having any Plantations therein: Which Lands (if they had been
managed as was designed, and by right should have been) besides the security
which thereby would have redounded to the English, being the best means under
God to have settled that Kingdom in perpetual Peace, Religion and Civility:
His Majesty's Revenues would have been bettered out of those lands by 90000lib.
per Annum, and that upon a very moderate estimate, allowing about ten pence for
every acre; those Territories being by admeasurement, known to be above two
millions of acres, besides the casual Revenues which would ensue: This you may
well say was a Princely gift indeed. But besides this, there were many other
things granted to them at the same time; for what reason I will not say, but
sure I am to the utter undoing of the English: Which (if they had but stayed
nine days longer from the execution of their Treason, till the Parliament,
according to the prorogation should have met again at Dublin) had been
confirmed to them by a Law: but there was something more in the wind then their
own benefit, that made them hasten it so much.

We understand your meaning, Civilis.
and I for my part am very much of your mind: I have heard all the particulars
of those graces, and do not see how they could think of making better
conditions to themselves by a war, then they had therein already granted to
them, supposing the fortune of the game should lean on their side: This being
so, I cannot see what the least appearance of reason there can be in that
color, That the Irish were necessitated to do what they did. I have always
thought upon what I have heard and read; that if there were at any time any
fault in the government of that Kingdom, it was in the gentleness and
remissness of it, in letting the cursed seed not only live, but increase, even
to an hundred fold: The Irish according to my observation, are a people not to
be ruled but with a rod of iron: Aut serviunt humiliter, aut superbe
dominantur, was of old a good Character of their natures, which they have kept
to this very day, being to be compared to nothing more fitly then to those two
heady elements of fire and water, that are the best servants being kept within
their own bounds; but once masters, lay all waste before them; this the Romans
even of old observed very well of them, when Agricol. in Ta^n.
one of them undertook to maintain that Kingdom in good subjection to the
Roman Empire (which the English could never yet compass) Vna legione and
modicis Auxiliis si Romana ubique Arma and libertas quasie conspectu
Tolleretur: And I cannot find a greater cause of this (I hope the last) and of
those many other insurrections against the English upon all occasions, then the
smoothing of all former Rebellions by Pardons upon fained submissions, whereby
the Irish were encouraged to play childrens play, and run in and out at their
pleasure, and had still opportunity to better and mend their new treasons in
point of execution, as they found they were out, and failed in their old: As if
the English, when they made but one or two of the principal actors examples,
had cut off but so many Hidra's heads which always multiplied upon their
hands; they always skinned over the wound before they had searched and drawn
it to the quick; so that the ill humor brake out continually, not long after
in a worse manner: and that which at first was but the corruption of one
inconsiderable part, for want of cutting that off, grew to a Gangreen, that
often heretofore, but never so apparently as at this day, endangered the whole
body.

CIVILIS had proceeded further, had not his friend MARCUS merrily pulled him by
the sleeve, and told him he forgot himself, since his Adversary had long since
laid down the cudgel, and the only ground of the digression was blown away
with the first breath: CIVILIS thanking his friend for his feasonable
remembrance, desired DECIUS to take up his Relation where he left off: which he
(being loath to deprive himself of the content he received in bearing of him on
that subject) hardly consented to; but MARCUS interposing, he proceeded as
follows.

You left me in very ill company, and so you must find me: Decius.
I and my Wife for many days together, having, as I told you, nothing to cover
our nakedness, but what we could gather up in the way, and as little to fill
our bellies; but (in the condition we were in) hunger was the least part of our
torment, for we were so little used to meat, that we had hardly room to receive
any. We were driven thus, for many days, from place to place, like sheep
appointed for the slaughter; and they that had not the strength to go as fast
as those cruel villains would have them, had the good fortune that many
thousand others wanted, to be buried in the next bogpit or ditch they met with:
When they thought they had sufficiently laden us with sorrow, and indeed
completed their cruelties, being not able to do any more (or rather God not
suffering of them) they permitted us (in their more cruel mercy) to take our
fortunes, believing we could not possibly escape the hands of other their
companions, who would have been glad of such subjects for their cruelty to work
on. Having thus cleared their hands of us, and, as they thought, deceived the
deceiver, we made what shift we could, and having lost much of our company in
the snow, who were able to go no farther, and having overtaken many more that
had set out from other parts, in the same sad journey with us, and not in any
better condition: We at length, by Gods great mercy, arrived safe at the next
strength to us, which at this time was possessed by the English: Where after we
had refreshed our selves as well as the charity of well-affected people would
permit, being divided amongst so many as daily resorted thither in the like
nessity: That place being too little to contain us, we set forward, not
without great danger, to Dublin; where as soon as we were arrived, my Wife, by
reason of the extremity of the cold she had taken, and the grief she conceived
for the loss of her children, and what else could be dear to her in this
world, fell sick and dyed, and multitudes more of those that got safe to
Dublin, having not time, as it were, to dye before; or the varieties of deaths
that stared them in the faces, being not able before now to agree, which should
take possession of them. When they were come thither, and considered the great
misfortunes, but more the heavy hand of God upon the English, their hearts
brake in sunder, and I am confident the blood of many thousands who have dyed
since, and will do for these many years yet to come, in that and other places
of that and this Kingdom, whether they fled for refuge and sanctuary, will be
put upon the same score, and their number I think may amount to as many as fell
by the sword.

CIVILIS and MARCUS being both struck with amazement at the horridness of
these things they had heard, could not readily find the use of their tongues to
express the fullness of their hearts: At length CIVILLS having walked a turn
or two in the room, and being returned to himself, as from a dream, first
vented his thoughts in this manner.

My good friend, Civilis.
though I am unspeakably grieved for your great sufferings, your own safety
does not a little abate my sorrow: I never look upon that damned Masterpiece
of the Devil, but, that in my own thoughts I am ready to excuse all the cursed
trecheries that ever I heard or read of, compared to this, me thinks they look
but like so many Piaefraudes, and the torments of all past ages may be thought
to have proceeded more from the favorable mercies of men, then from their
cruelty: I am confident that God that has so preserved you, has done it partly
for this end, that your own eyes might behold the Vyals of his wrath and
vengeance which he has filled and laid up in store, plentifully poured out uon
them: and I am persuaded if we can but with patience expect his own time, the
time will come, and your eyes shall see it, when those tongues that cried so
loud in the day of Jerusalem, Race it, raee it, even to the foundation, shall
cry as loud (but all in vain) to those same mountains whereon you were
scattered and hunted like Partridges, to fall and cover them; and those hands
that have lain so heavy on the backs of so many thousands of you, shall strike
as hard their own breasts, and cleave as fast to their own loins; and those
feet that have been so swift to shed blood, shall not carry them away so fast,
but that the fierce anger of the Lord shall overtake them.

Though I cannot be so eloquent as my friend CIVILIS, Marcus.
yet my Amen may very well stand at the end of his speech: So let thine enemies
perish, O Lord, and those that hate thee flee before thee.

I perceive MARCUS that the sad Relation which you have newly heard, has not
wrought so kindly with you, Civilis.
as it has done with me, since you can so soon abuse your friend; but I will
bear it for once, if you promise me to be content with our company all this
evening; and you DECIUS will be pleased (I hope) to bear part of his burden.
Both being well satisfied, CIVILIS turning to DECIUS, spoke to this purpose.

Since you have been pleased to trouble your self thus far, give me leave to
disturb you a little more, and to know how long you have been in this Kingdom,
and what occasions brought you out of Ireland: I doubt not but you will excuse
me, knowing how particular an interest my affection gives me in every thing
that concerns you; and I know MARCUS will take it for the best part of his
entertainment in this house, to sit and hear you. MARCUS agreeing to what was
said for him, he sat down by CIVILIS, and DECIUS spoke as follows.

You cannot desire that of me which I shall not be ready to grant you; you must
know then, that at my first coming to Dublin, Decius.
I found the City in great perplexity, the English not knowing which they
should fear first, either the Irish without, or those within amongst
themselves; they were all, as it were, at their wits ends, and no body almost
knew which way to turn himself: The Rebels were infinite for numbers, and
within the City, only a poor company of raw ignorant Townsmen, that for their
number could not be thought able to conquer so often as their enemies might be
overcome: Notwithstanding all these discouragements, though I saw palenesse in
every man's face, each one accounting himself already (as it were) amongst the
dead: I observed so much courage and resolution in those that then sat at the
Helm, that I for my part could not at all fear a shipwreck; and therefore at
that time could not think of quitting the Kidgdome, though I saw many take that
course as the safest, hazarding themselves in a storm at Sea in open Botes, to
escape that they feared on Land, if they should stay behind: Those that only
attended the service, and were careful to discharge their duties, though with
the apparent danger of their lives, by sitting constantly at Counsell-Board,
whither multitudes of such as were then secret, and afterward professed
Rebels, daily resorted, and might (if God had not stayed their hands) have put
their plot in execution for many weeks after their three and twentieth of
October, as well as they could have done at that day. Those, I say, that in all
that foul weather (when the Heavens were all blackk about them, and not so much
as one beam of comfort to be seen) stood still to their tackling, and plied
their work, without ever giving over, were only the two Lords Justices, by
name, Sir William Parions and Sir John Bortase, and Sir Adam Lofius,
Vice-treasurer; Sir John Temple, Master of the Rolls, Sir Charles Coot, from
the time that he arrived at Dublin, and when he was not abroad in the Field;
and Sir Robert Meredith, Chancellor of the Exchequer: Those other
blazing-starres and unlucky meteors that have since hung over our heads, and
have had such ill influence on all the affairs of that Kingdom, and put all
into combustion, being some of them at that time not exhaled from the earth,
and as little known by name of Privy-Counsellours as they deserved it; and
others, some for fear, and some for dis-affection to the service, keeping
themselves at home, and seldom or never coming to Counsel or having fled
into England.

It was the great mercy of God, Civilis.
that a that time of extreme hazard and necessity, sent you such men as were
not afraid to stand for you, and to open their mouths in your defense, when
yours and their enemies fists were ready to enclose them with a blow; and truly
they ought to be had in everlasting remembrance: and those that absenced
themselves in that time of pressing necessity (by my consent) should have had
the Counsell-chamber-doores for ever shut in their faces and I can as little
excuse those that kept themselves away through fear, as those others that did
it through dis-affection, it being a breach of trust in both; and he that
fears even his life, when his Religion and Country calls for, and requires his
help, will to save his life, or perhaps a poorer commodity, betray both.

We have found what you say very true, and could have wished that they that
kept themselves then away, ahd done so still, and not to have come to do the
English the greatest mischief instead of service. But if you please I shall
proceed.

You will do us a special favor in it. Civilis. Decius.


Sir Charles Coot (by a special providence being sent to Dublin when the
English stood in so much need of a man of his spirits (was immediately made
Governor of that City; how he carried himself in that charge, and what
resolution and gallantry he showed in the field against the Rebels, with that
small handful of men which the State put under his command: If I were able to
express to you, I might very well be thought to speak a piece of a Romanse: It
shall suffice that I tell you, that by his courageous execution, and the as
faithful contrivement of those that sat at Counsell-board (the blessing of
God accompanying their endeavors) whereas at first for the English (with all
their strength) to march out of the City as far as Clantarfe, a place not two
miles from them, The Counsel only.
was looked upon as an attempt of great hazard and danger; in a very short time
we were able to seek the Rebels in their own holds, and beat them, as I may
say, on their owue Dunghils. Not long after this, the Army that was sent from
hence by the Parliament, arrived safe at Dublin, which put new life and spirit
into our breasts, and as much terrified the Rebels, having its more then
probable, some pre-assurance, that nothing should be done against them here;
thinking the troubles here, being indeed a thread of the same spinning, would
have followed their needle; but they were somewhat deceived in the time, though
for the matter it fell out as was designed. The affairs of the Protestants
began now to smile upon them, and we perceived already the glimmerings of a
more glorious day then ever we saw before (so that we were brought (if not to
forget our former sufferings, yet) at least not to regard them, in comparison
of those happy times we saw every day drawing nearer and nearer to us; our
Armies always carried victory in their Van, and in their Rear, left the
Country to the peaceable possession of the English, the Rebels running
continually before us; five chasing a hundred, and ten putting a thousand to
flight.

The resolutions of the Counsel were apparently to the good of the English,
and nothing to be seen amongst them that favored of unjust or selfith ends: As
we enjoyed the benefits of their labors and watchings, so we did our
endeavors that they might be the better for our prayers, wherein we were not
wanting, nor in the praises of our God for them, and the blessing, we daily
received by their means that God that had compassion on us in our low estate,
and when we were truly in our blood, said unto us, Live.

CIVIL IS and MARCUS being both as much affected with joy by this last part of
DECIUS his Relation, as before they were with sorrow; MARCUS being not able any
longer to contain himself, interrupted DECIUS, as be was going on, and said:

When I compare the first part of your Relation with this that you are now
upon, Marcus.
and consider that Chaos and confusion, that darkness that was upon the face
of the whole Land, and now again, this light that was divided from that
darkness; me thinks I see the hand of God, like that of a man in it, and
writing, as it did once to Belshazzar, upon the wall; but mercy instead of
judgment: Not as there, Dan. 5. ^ 42.8.
Thy Kingdom is divided, and given to the Meads and Persians; but this, My
glory will I not give to another, nor my praise to graven Images.

Alas Sir, Decius.
this evening and morning that you have seen, make but up the first day; there
are six more behind, all days of labor and sorrow to the English, and no
Sabbath of rest from their sufferings. You have seen us, like a ship tossed and
driven to and fro in a dangerous storm, our masts split, our sails blown
away, our anchors lost, and in a word, left as men without hope in the world:
you have seen us again by the skillful conduct of our Pilots, and the good
providence of our great Master in Heaven, brought within sight of a safe
harbor, and now you must behold us split upon the Bars mouth and every one
like Paul's Passengers, some upon boards, and some upon broken pieces of the
ship, laboring to escape safely to Land.

CIVILIS desiring him to let them partake with him both of the good and had,
DECIUS continued his speech as follows.

The first appearance, and (as I may say) the buds that have since blossomed
and grown into such bitter and uncomfortable fruits, were seen after the death
of that never to be forgotten, incomparable Commander, Sir Charles Coot; a
death that was attended with as much sorrow, and prosecuted with as much misery
to us, as it will be remembered with glory and honor to him.

We in these parts were not a little sensible of your great loss in a man
that was every way so fitted for those times (if it had been Gods will they
should be mended) and though the manner of his fall (being, ^vilie.
as is reported, by one of his Soldiers) did increase the sorrow of some; for
my part, that circumstance did not then work a greater grief (seeing his
enemies had not that happiness they desired) as now (upon what you have told
us) it has raised a suspicion in me, that there was something more then fair
play in the business.

If it were so, Decius.
God in the end will search it out; and when all those loud cries of the
Protestant blood in Ireland shall come before him, he will not turn away his
ear from this: Whether it were so or no, I am sure the party that did the deed
was never questioned or examined concerning the same; and there was so good use
made of his death, as may make a man believe he was taken out of the way; that
the Mystery of that Iniquity which had a secret working in his life time, might
be more fully revealed after his death: From that time every thing began to
look new, and the Counsell-Board to be silled with new Counselors; men that
had lain hid before like Swallows in winter; but now like Tares (sown by the
wicked one) suddenly overtop the good Corn; so that there was to be seen an
universal change in all our Counsels: as before our Counselors looked all
like Cherubims, face to face, you might see them now like Samp^ons Foxes,
drawing several ways: the former being too honest, to hold their tongues and
suffer things, to run on quietly in disorder; and these latter too numerous,
and false to be overruled, from whence arose a slack and unfaithful
prosecution of the War, so well begun against the Rebels; the countenancing
of all manner of unheard of confusions, and the oppression of the small
remainder of the almost heart-broken English, and the bold and open favoring
of the most bloody wretches that ever the Sun beheld. The labors of this Party
and their diligence was so great, that within a short time we were reduced to
our first principles, and brought, as I may say, to a worse condition
(notwithstanding the large and good supplies sent from hence) then we were at
the very beginning of the Rebellion, when we had nothing almost (God knows) to
support us. The place which God of his great mercy reserved for a City of
refuge for the English to find safety and comfort in, was open and free to the
worst of their enemies, and they that had shed and poured out like waters, so
much innocent blood in the Country, had the liberty to come thither, and
profess not their repentance, but their sotrow that they did no more, though
indeed that lay not in their power to commit greater villainies.

As long as I lived in Dublin (I mean since the command of this Party) I could
never learn that ever any true hearted protestant was relieved, or had even
ordinary justice done him, if the case lay between him and an Irish man, or a
Papist. The affliction of my brethren being so great, and the tyranny under
which they lived being so insupportable, I chose (rather then be a daily
witness of it, and in some measure a sufferer, there being none, though never
so poor, that could escape free) to quit all for the present, and bid adieu to
that Kingdom, till it should please God to look upon it in mercy, and settle
justice and truth in the midst of it; and this, I am sure, was the thoughts and
desires of many thousands English more, whose want of accommodation elsewhere
keeps them in that place, and enforces them to live in that intolerable
slavery. And thus, with what brevity I could (fearing to be troublesome) I have
satisfied you concerning the occasion of my coming into this Kingdom, where I
have been these three months, most of which time I have spent in this City.

We must acknowledge our selves much bound to you for the favor you have done
us, Civilis.
and I hope since your coming to this place you are lightened of a good part of
your burden, finding us in a condition, I presume, far beyond what you could
imagine when you were in that Kingdom, and in a good way to a happy end, which
will be (under God) the only means to set you straight again in that
Kingdme, whereof you are yet in capability: the Earl of Ormond having,
notwithstanding his Majesty's Letters, commanding him to conclude a peace there
with the Rebels on any conditions; wisely to this day held off his hand, as it
is thought, from the very beginning, with an intention to give it to the
Parliament. MARCUS observing some confusion in DECIUS his face upon this
speech, told his friend, that he feared he had spoken something distatefull,
and therefore that it concerned him, before be proceeded any further, to give
DECIUS satisfaction, who he saw was suddenly moved with something that fell
from him. CIVILIS thanking his friend, and desiring DECIUS to be free with him,
and to set him straight, if he had failed, as he confessed he might very easily
do, being not so well acquainted with the particulars of that Kingdom: DECIUS
expressing some unwillingnesse, and a kind of anger against himself, that his
countenance had betrayed him, spoke to this purpose.

I should be very 10th CIVILIS to descent from you in any thing but on
necessary grounds, Decius.
especially in such a business as this that we are now fallen upon, which
concerns a particular person, having, as you might have observed from the
beginning of this Conference, baulkt the mentioning of any person, as the
actors in a misery, more then in the general, knowing how subject it is (if we
speak sharply, though accordin gto truth, in every particular) to the judgment
and doom of passion, rancor and invectivenesse; yet fince a special
providence has brought the Earl of Ormond and laid him cross my way, I cannot
pass him by without laboring to undeceive you in the opinion you have
conceived of him, and so far am I from any private spleen or interest to draw
me aside to an obliquity in what I shall lay before you; that I protest I
heartily with I could with truth give my self the lie in what I shall say
concerning him; I perceive by that little you have said of him, how much you
will wonder when I shall tell you, he has been the chief instrument of all the
misery that at this day the Protestants of that Kingdom groan under, and the
most faithful servant to the Irish that ever they had, wherein I must say, he
has done but what his blood and nature required of him; his Family having long
since degenerated into Irish, and for himself in his own inclination, one as
much addicted to their ways (having all his kindred and friends amongst them)
as he that knows the least either of Religion or humanity: And for that
particular of keeping back the peace, I can assure you they deceive themselves
very much, that the Earl of Ormond would leave any thing undone that might
tend to the perfecting of that work he has always so vigorously pursued:
Believe it Sir, that the peace there was not long since concluded (though I
cannot positively say it is not at this day) was not because the Earl of
Ormond was unwilling to consent to whatever the Rebels could demand of him, the
contrary plainly appearing by those Articles formerly consented unto by him,
(which I doubt not you have seen in print) wherein the Rebels have all they can
desire, both toleration of Religion, suspention of Poynings Act, and all other
Laws made for the good of the Protestants: But in truth, the obstruction was
still on the Rebels side, they being unwilling) however they pretended
otherwise) to accept of, or adventure on a peace; knowing how little (in the
condition the King was) it could avail them, but also how thereby they should
be engaged to maintain an Army here in England, whereby their own Country
might be left to the power of the Protestants (being considerable in diverse
parts of the Kingdom;) and besides, I do verily believe they were conscious
to themelves of their own inability to afford the King such considerable
assistance, as (after such large conditions afforded to them) they would have
been strictly tied unto, and his Majesty might expect from them: However the
Earl of Ormond and their other friends have represented them unto him as able
to do great matters.

I cannot but much wonder indeed at what you tell us concerning the Earl of
Ormond; Civilis.
I do remember him here in England under the care of Abbot Archbishop of
Canterbury, and (for what I could discern in his younger years) there appeared
in him the hopes of better performances; and truly sir, I will not dissemble
with you, I have heard from many that are come from Dublin, and are still in
this City, and on whom the Parliament has bestowed some other marks of of their
favor, besides admitting of them to reside here; that he has carried himself
from the beginning with all respect and good conscience to the English, and as
one firmly rooted and resolved in the protestant Religion.

I do not doubt but that you have met with many, Decius.
who for several ends are engaged to speak the best of him: Since my coming
to this place, I happened more then once to be a witness of some high
expressions in his behalf, but I Will assure you Sir, they came only from such
(as upon good grounds I was assured) were employed over hither by the Earl of
Ormond, to work the people into a moderate good opinion of him, that so he
might continue his wicked practices against the English, and that if at length
the Protestant party should prevail in both Kingdoms (when there were no
other remedy to preserve his estate, and to be able in time to come to do
further mischief) he may on easier terms be accepted and make his peace: and
I am persuaded to this belief of these men, not only by the falsnesse of what
ine very place they declaime, but also by the favor, I know, they are in with
the Earl of Ormond, and the protection he still vouchsafes their commands,
offices and interests there, notwithstanding their residing here, on
pretenses; which, if true, would render them extremely odious to him: For the
matter of what they give out, to hinder a harsher judgment of him concerniyg
his education, and his firmness in the Protestant Religion, I shall only say
this; that if you consider the perverseness of the natures of Irish, and more
especially of such as have degenerated into them, Notwithstanding the
carefullest education, it will not seem impossible to you, though the Earl of
Ormond, notwithstanding his breed under Bishop Abbot, should follow his kind,
and prove as notorious as any. The Irish of all people on the earth, are they
that abhor most to be reformed, in whose very being it is to love barbarism;
and though sometimes by peace, and the English dwelling amongst them, they have
seemed to cast off their old skins, and put on some kind of civility upon the
least occasion offered, they have run, like hogs, greedily again to their
vomits, and, like swine, have whet their tusks against such as would only have
kept them from returning to wallow in the mire; and this is the reason that
five or six hundred years have wrought so little upon them, and that the
English have reaped only the fruit of their labors, namely, the experience
(and a very sad one) how impossible a thing it is to make an unwilling Nation
happy. And again, if we look from the nature of the Irish into the effects of
it, and consider this unnatural Rebellion, we shall find that none are more
cruelly bent against the English, and thirst more after their blood, then such
as have the same blood, though corrupted in their veins, and none more eager
followers of their barbarous customs, then such as have had the good fortune
and misery at once to know better, and were bred up with all possible care in
our Schools and Universities, and in the Protestant Religion: Nay, so far
has the corruption proceeded, that many of those Commanders that were sent from
hence, have turned their backs to the English, and have been made the
instruments to undo and ruin them, for whose sakes, they were employed into
that Kingdom; (as if the whole earth had the property that some of its waters
have, to turn all that is cast into it, into stone.) By this time, I believe,
it will be so far from seeming impossible, that the Earl of Ormond should
follow those courses, that it will not in any measure seem strange, since the
very English themselves, who have wanted those allurements of blood and
friendship, temptations which could never be out of the Earl of Ormonds sight,
have been made supporters to the Irish, for whose destruction they were sent
thither.

For what other part concerning the E. of Ormonds religion, though there might
be much said of that subject, touching the gentleness and moderation of it (if
it were my intention to meddle with his person) I shall only say thus much, That
it was the greatest misfortune to the English, that he made profession of the
same religion with them, knowing very well how little he would have been able to
do for his country men, had he not put on sheeps clothing: By this means he
was a thief within the house, and had the keys committed into his hand to
dispose of all at his pleasure: not to hold you long, I shall give you this
short, but truest character of him. He is one whose heart has been as red in
the blood of the Protestants, as any of his Country men's hands; without whom
the English in that Kingdom might have been in a condition, not only to have
cleared all at home, but also to have required you here: whereas by the
treachery of this man htey have been betrayed into that misery, which at this
day makes them the objects of pity in all, but such as have assisted in his
courses, and resolve still to lay more and more weight upon them, till they
have cast them down, never to rise again; which they will not fail to
compass, if God do not speedily put to his almighty hand and make him fall
into the pit which he has dug so deep for them.

I have known you too long Decius, Civilis.
to think you would say any thing but on very good grounds, especially in a
business of this nature, where the honor and life of any is concerned; for
((...) you Sir) if what you say be true, as upon the confidence I have in you,
I shall suspend my belief of any thing I have heard to the contrary; he
deserved so little the thoughts of the Parliament to accept of him, should he
now at last submit to them, that were I to be one of his Judges, I should not
be able to satisfy my conscience in the performance of the duty I owe both to
my Country and Religion, did I not give my vote to make him the severest
example for after Ages, to judge the greatness and heinousness of his treason
by. I desire for our better satisfaction, that you would be pleased to give us
the knowledge of some particulars concerning him, that being convinced our
selves, we may be able upon occasion to stop the mouths of such as open them in
his commendation.

Seeing I shall have my share in the pleasure of your Relation, Marcus.
I should in no wise deserve it, did I not add my prayers to those of my
friend Civilis, that you would be pleased to proceed in it, though I think my
desires will be but superfluous; the subject (being such as concerns the good
of the Public, whereof I believe you sufficiently careful) being argument more
then enough to induce you to it: I shall rather trouble you with a request of
my own, which I know was in Civilis his mind to have remembered you of; however
his impatience till he heard you speak made him omit it: But because I perceive
it is contrary to your disposition, I shall be afraid to propound it to you,
unless Civilis also make use of his power with you to persuade you to consent
to it.

Civilis undertaking for Decius, that he should consent to whatever was
reasonable, whereof if they pleased, he would be judge between them. Decius and
Marcus being both content to cast themselves upon him, Marcus continued.

You remember Civilis (for we must speak to our judge) how not long since, you
gave a wrong judgment of the Earl of Ormond, (I for my part may call it so
already) and yet though the fault were yours, the blame must be Decius his;
seeing his good nature (in his relation of the misery of the Protestants in
Ireland) forbore to name the authors of it, which if he had done, I suppose,
you Civilis, had not run into that error: now to prevent the like hereafter, my
desire is, that Decius (if while he speaks of the Earl of Ormond, the occasion
shall draw him upon others) that he would not be sparing of their names, that
we may know and mark such as have walked disorderedly, and not according to a
straight and just rule: This I suppose is but equal, which if Decius assent
unto, he will oblige us both, if he observe it in his following relation.

Civilis casting the cause upon Marcus his side (notwithstanding all that
Decius could bring to exempt himself from so envious a work; he having tied
himself to submit to what Civilis should detormine, proceeded on as follows.

You may judge (by my readiness to obey you) what power your commands have
over me, Decius.
seeing they unavoidably put me upon the remembrance of what I cannot think of
without the greatest anger and indignation that is possible; with this
encouragement however, that therein I doubt not, but before I have done, you
will both bear your shares with me; and that I may observe some kind of order
in what I shall say, I will begin with the confidence the Rebels from the
beginning reposed in the Earl of Ormond (which were argument sufficient to
prove him false) and then I shall show you how faithfully (if I may misuse that
good word) he answered that trust of theirs in every particular. To prove both
which, I shall not need to squeeze conclusions out of conjectures or
probabilities, but shall give you the naked fact, which sufficiently discovers
it self, and his own speeches, and the results of his own made Counsel, from
the mouths of those of his own party, who were not ashamed to publish what
they had done in the chamber upon the house top.

Civilis and Marcus approving of the Division be had made, and the way he
promised to take in handling of the parts, he went on in this manner.

The first thing that I propounded to clear to you, is the great trust and
confidence the Rebels from the beginning reposed in him. To make good which,
though there be many more then probabilities to induce a reasonable man to
believe he was acquainted with the first design and plot of the Rebellion, and
there be some (that when time serves) can tell what advice and conncell he gave
for the execution of it; having resolved with my self to bring nothing before
you but what carries the light of the Sun along with it: I shall give you as
pregnant a proof as can be desired.

In the beginning of November next after the Rebellion brake out, the
Parliament, according to the prorogation, met again at Dublin, whither many
who were chief plotters and contrivers of that bloody Treason, though at that
time the Castle of Dublis, by Gods great mercy, being secured, they had not
declared themselves; boldly resorted the Lords of the Pale and some others (who
were all, it is well known) the first in that transgression, in whose heads the
business was carried long before it came into the others hands) had the faces
to come and sit in the upper House, to advise forsooth for the safety of the
English, whom before they had voted to destruction. Amongst many other good
motions, it was thought fit by the aforesaid House of Lords, the Earl of
Ormond concurring, that the Lord Costelogh Dillon should be sent to his Majesty
into England, with such propositions as they thought expedient for the settling
of peace again in that Kingdom; and accordingly he was dispatched away with
private Instructions, how he should carry himself, and what chiefly he was to
insist on: and though the honest party at Counsell-board (being at that time in
power) had in their Letters to Court, given a large character of the man and
his errand, and expressed their dislike of both in order to his Majesty's
honor and the good of the Protestants; being taken prisoner here after his
escape, you may perhaps have heard how he was entertained at Oxford: but it
being out of our way, I pass it by. The maine of his Instructions was to work
with the King, that the quieting of the Rebellion might be left wholly to the
Parliament there, and that no forces might be sent over out of England to make
the breach wider, instead of closing of it; and to complete all, he was to
procure the Earl of Ormond to be made Lord Licutenant of Ireland. Behold Sirs,
the same men that would have no assistance from hence, without which the
English (in all humain probability) would have perished, as the next thing they
thought could work to the Rebels advantage, sue that the Earl of Ormond might
be made Governor: And least the name of a Parliament held at Dublin may
stumble you, and make you believe these Lords were honest at that time, and at
the drawing of those Instructions had not engaged themselves to the Rebels
party: You must know (after their going into Rebellion) they still owned the
Lord Dillon as their Agent, and it was ordered at a full Counsel of the Rebels
at Kilkenny, that the profits of the said Lord Dillons Lands should be secured
to him, forasmuch as he was employed to his Majesty by them, for the good of
the Catholic Cause.

Truly Decius, Civilis.
I think you have put your best strength in the Van, for I cannot see what
could prove your first point more clearly, and in the last place, you have
fully answered an objection I was then going to propound to you; that order of
the Counsel of Kilkenny cuts on both sides, and like Janus his face, looks two
several ways. But I wrong my friend Marcus, I pray you therefore say on.

In January 1642. Decius.
when the Rebels were now a formed body, and licked into a State, upon a
Petition of the chief Lords and Gentlemen of the Rebels sent to the Earl of
Ormond, and by him kindly transmitted to his Majesty, his Majesty did by his
Letters, sent by Master Thomas Bourke, an arch-papist and a chief Rebel,
require the Lords Justices to give power to the said Earl to give a meeting to
the chiefest of the Rebels, and to send to his Majesty such grievances and
desires as they should think fit to present to him by his Lordships hands.
Amongst many other grievances and other goodly demands which, no doubt, you
have seen in print (though they were kept dose from the Justices and Counsel
by the Earl of Ormond) for many months after, they were published by the
Rebels in foreign Kingdoms; and when the Book was commonly sold amongst us,
it was not suffered to be answered, but all motions made to that purpose in
Parliament, slighted by Sir Morice Eustace, Speaker of the House of Commons
there, an Irish man (to say no worse of him, and one of the Earl of Ormonds
Cabinet counsel.) Amongst many other, I say, strange desires, at that time,
transmitted by the Earl of Ormond to his Majesty, one was this; The Rebels
Remonstrance at Trym.
That his Majesty would be pleased to grant that they might be governed by one
of their own Nation, a man of estate and repute amongst them.] This you may
easily perceive was the same with the former, contained in the Lord Dillons
Instructiions, though (his Majesty being sufficiently already acquainted with
their meaning, and perhaps the Earl of Ormond himself) the English being now
more formidable, was not willing to be named as before, but his name was left
to be understood. Upon these desires of the Rebels, no doubt the Earl of
Ormond (from the very beginning) had strong assurances of being made Lord
Lieutenant, and that the Earl of Leicester should not stand in his way, who
was purposely long detained at Court; and having at length obtained his
dispatch, and being as far as Chester on his way, was unexpectedly recalled;
and the carriage of the Earl of Ormond toward the Earl of Leceister, and
those that belonged to him, is argument enough to prove, that he well knew he
should never come to any super-intendency over him, to overlook or check his
proceedings.

I do make haste from this first point, because the next is that that will
hold me longer; and by this that you have already heard, you may easily judge
of the truth of what I promised in the first place to prove to you, namely, the
considence the Rebels had in him, which I may boldly swear, they never
intended should prove for the good of the English.

It remains, that I declare to you, how he has not failed in point of
gratitude to the Irish that relied so much upon him: This general head will
fall into sundry particular Treasons and misdemeanors, altogether tending to
this only end, namely, to save and protect his beloved Countrymen from the
just revengefull arms of the English; (and that he might compass that) to
bring the English into that condition, that they might not be able to prosecute
a war, but he glad to accept of such terms of cessation or peace, as he and
the Rebels (I am forced for distinction sake to sever them) should be pleased
to afford them; and when there should be now no more use of the Army in
Ireland, to bring them (with the Rebels, who from the beginning still boasted
they would come over into England) to turn their swords against the Parliament
here, that had employed, paid and entrusted them: And here Sirs, I doubt not
but to make it appear to you, that the necessity (we here so much talk of) was
so far from being a cause of that bloody cessation, that the Earl of Ormonds
design to secure his Countrymen by that cessation was the only cause of that
necessity; which (notwithstanding all his pernicious endeavors to bring it
upon us) was not, by Gods mercy, so great, but that the Army might very well
have subsisted, and that the world might see through it, that the safety of the
Protestants was only pretended by him, when nothing but utter ruin was really
intended.

There was nothing had that power over me, Marcus.
to persuade me to a charitable opinion of that cessation, as the word
Necessity; and (to confeste ingeniously to you) I could not tell what to say,
when in the Kings Declaration touching that business, I found necessity so
much complained of in the Letters from your own Counsel, which I thought they
would not have done if it had been only fictitious, and not real.

Truly Marcus you have prevented me, Civilis.
for I was just then thinking of the same thing; those Letters having (in many
men's apprehensions) done that work to the full, for which they were inserted in
that Declaration, which was the justification of the proceedings in that
cessation.

I shall anon acquaint you at lage with the occasion of those Letters, Decius.
only for the present to remove them somewhat out of our way (in general) I
shall tell you, that part of them which expressed the dispairing condition of the
state, was written always, as you shall plainly see by and by, by reason of
the Earl of Ormonds violent stickling for it, and by the overruling vote of
his accomplices at the Board, and contrary to the opinion and advice of the
honest Party who knew the contary, and that the Army might very well have
subsisted by the means even of those small supplies sent from hence; yea
though they had been less, had not the Earl of Ormond used all the art and
power he could to prevent and hinder it: This Sirs, since I am first fallen
upon it, I shall labor to clear unto you.

Civilis and Marcus expressing their desire to be informed by him, be continued
his speech as follows.

The first and best means that could be used to bring the Army to necessity
and want, was to keep it idle at home in our own quarters; The Earl of Ormond
had heard of that maxim, nihil difficilius est quam exercitum otiosum alere;
and therefore having the sole command of the Army, he always kept it in, and
about the City of Dublin, a place thirty or forty miles most ways from any
considerable enemy; so that there was at all times five or six thousand men fed
upon the public stores of that place, who might have been sent abroad and
lived in the enemies Country; and there were sometimes eight or nine thousand
men maintained out of the Magazine at Dublin, and most commonly there was
victuals delivered out for more men by one third part, then were really to be
found in the Town; and notwithstanding all that the honest party (at
Counsell-board) could do, his Lordship would never be brought to take a view
of the Army to discover the true strength of it; but when (upon the importunity
of the honest Privy Counselors) the men were once carried into the Field to
take the right number of them, he found out an occasion to dismiss them, and
also the business was disappointed; though (which is observable) when upon the
cessation he saw the English would expect that the Army should be supplied by
the contribution of the Rebels (which the Earl of Ormond had talked much of, to
induce the English to consent to that cessation;) he of himself could then give
strict order therein, that the Rebels might not be burdened above what was
necessary in the least measure.

This particular of keeping so many men continually in Dublin, Civilis.
I conceive is that which cannot be answered, if there were any possibility of
maintaining them abroad to do service against the Rebels: I desire therefore
to be satisfied in that point which is all that can be thought of to justify
that action.

Your desire is indeed very material, Decius.
but I shall easily satisfy you in it; for you must know, the Earl of Ormond
did this, not only contrary to many Remonstrances of the honest party at
Counsell-Board (declaring the evil consequences thereof) but also to the
overtures and motions of several Commanders in the Army, who undertook to
maintain the Army abroad, and make them subsist upon the Rebels, if the Earl
of Ormond would suffer it: Sir Arthur Loftus his Examination.
Sir Arthur Loftus Governor of the Naas, undertook to maintain there a
thousand men, without charge to the State, if the Earl of Ormond would also
send him two or three Troops of horse which lay idle about Dublin: Sir Charles
Coot his Examination.
Sir Charles Coote long solicited the Earl of Ormond for a thousand Foot and
two or three Troops to carry into Conogh, where he undertook to maintain them
upon the Rebels during the War. And many the like propositions were made by
others, but the Earl of Ormond knew too well how much it would have prejudiced
his Countrymen and his design, to save them by a peace or cessation, to
consent to any of them; but they were all slighted by him, and notwithstanding
he had still the face to complain of the necessity of the Army, and to the
great disturbance of all debates at Counsel-board for the good of the English,
and the promoting of the Service, to press and cry continually for Letters to
be writ to his Majesty; declaring their lamentable condition, and how they were
not possibly able to subsist, no not for a few days, whereby the Officers and
Soulders were encouraged to all manner of mutinous disorders, being most of
them already wrought to a weariness of the service, and to a desire to come
into England to gain the spoil of the same, whereof his Lordship and his
instruments had given them assurance.

The Lord Lisle being sensible of the Earl of Ormonds proceedings, and how he
labored all that he could on pretense of necessity, to gain for the Rebels
what they desired, to the ruin of the English; to wipe away that color of
necessity, and that it might clearly appear where the fault lay, that the
Protestants were not in a better condition, undertook about January 1642. a
design for the carrying out a great part of our Army to live abroad in the
Country, and do good service against the Rebels; the proposition (as it
deserved) was much magnified by all, being so much for the good of the English,
that indeed it was the only means for their preservation: The Earl of Ormond
upon the Lords Justices and honest Privy-Counsellours motion, gave consent unto
it; whereupon all things were prepared, Iron Mils and other necessaries, not
without great charge, were provided, and all things being now in a readiness
for the Lord Lisle to march: The Earl of Ormond (foreseeing how much this
would ruin his plot, and fearing that he intended for the County of Kilkenny,
a place which he always kept untouched, being the chief seat of the
Rebellion, where their supreme Counsel resided) declared, he would go out
himself in person, and (contrary to the will of the Justices, and the advice
of the honest party at Counsell-Board, saying, he had power of himself without
them, to carry out the Army when and whither he pleased) he overthrew the Lord
Lisles motion, having no other design then to thwart his, which looked too
severely (he thought) upon the Rebels his beloved Countrymen: Sometimes he
declared he would go into the County of Wesimeath, other times into the County
of Longford, but at length (having taken new Counsels, and caused the State to
furnish him with a treble proportion of money to what the Lord Lisle desired for
his expedition, which the Parliament Commissioners then at Dublin were forced
to take up in that necessity upon their own word, otherwise he and some of his
Minions of the Counsel of war, protesting they were the cause of the
disappointment of that so important a service, and having upon his own motion
a general Warrant granted him from the Lords Justices, to command all the
shiping upon the coast of the whole Kingdom, a thing which before was never
given out of the hands of the chief Governor for the time, and having a
Warrant likewise for the putting of the whole Country, wherever he came, to
contribution; and full power given him to protect them, otherwise saying, he
could not be able to keep the Army abroad, as he pretended he would do, for
three months; he marched out of Dublin with about 4000. foot, and four or five
hundred horse.

In their martch through the County of Kildare, they took in three or four
Castles, namely, Timelin, Tullow and Castle-Martin, and therein such quantities
of corn, as would have been sufficient to have fed the Army three months; but
the Earl of Ormond suffered it to be consumed and wasted, and no use made of it
to their benefit: That which was taken in Timelin, was left most of it in the
same condition it was found: and after the Earl of Ormond was martched away,
the Rebels came and possessed themselves again of it, which will be made good
by Colonel Monk and by the parties that surveyed the corn in those Castles: By
which it may appear, he never had any intention to maintain the Army abroad,
or that he took those places to any other end, then to waste the ammunition and
provision which he carried out with him, and which (he knew) was all the store:
Castle Martin, and some other places taken by him, being not long after sold,
and delivered up to the Rebels, and that at very low rates: Castle Martin was
sold to the Rebels by Colonel Hunkes, whose company had the possession of it,
and no notice taken of it by the Earl of Ormond in public; but what thanks he
gave in private for it, we may guess (presuming it was done by his own order.)

I cannot but admire (Decius) at what you have told me, Civilis.
seeing how much hitherto the Earl of Ormonds carriage disagrees from those
expressions I have heard some give of him, upon whom hereafter I shall look as
enemies to the Commonwealth, and as such as deserve to partake in the severest
of his punishments; and truly (by what I have already heard from you, and some
other Relations which I have received of the carriage of the Earl of Thomond
and some others in Munster) I begin plainly to understand the vanity of
employing any of the Irish in considerable command in that service, if we ever
intend to have the work carried on thoroughly and faithfully, and not partially
and by halves.

I have ever in my own thoughts embraced that opinion as the most certain and
safest way for the English, Decius.
and indeed supposing there were such of that Nation as could so far overcome
their own natures, as willingly to undertake so contrary a work, I supposed it
a point of cruelty in man (if there were no more in it) to put humain nature to
so hard a task, as to embrue his hands in the blood of those nearest to him,
which was thought by God a sufficient trial even for such a faith as Abraham's:
But besides this, I ever esteemed it a point of the greatest indiscretion, to
expose the English to the mercy of so many temptations as daily beset such men,
and it being a certain rule, that no man ever hated his own flesh, though
some would be believed, to have attained to that perfection; but if you please
to give me leave, I shall begin where I left off in my Relation.

Civilis praying him to do so, be continued his speech in this manner.

After the taking of those Castles (as you have heard) the Earl of Ormond
carried the Army before the Town of Rose, through a country which he knew
could afford them nothing but streights and wants, whereas if he had gone ten
miles on the other hand into an open Country, he might have been in the heart
of a place untouched by any enemy, where the Army might have subsisted upon the
Rebels as long as they pleased; but the Earl of Ormond had not for that end
preserved that Country from spoil, to be now wasted; And whereas before the
Earl of Ormonds advance toward Rosse, the Rebels might have been at a loss,
not knowing which way our Forces would bend, being equally near Kilkenny,
Wexford and Rosse, to clear them of that doubt, and to free them from the
danger of a surprise, which (if the whole Army' or a party of Foot, with some
Horse, had speedily martched up to either of those places) might easily have
been performed: He commanded the Lord Lisle with some Horse, without either
Foot or Dragoons, to martch before to Rosse, which gave the Country an allarum,
and the body of Foot came up so slowly after, that the Town had time to
prepare it self, and to take in more Forces; whereas if there had been Foot
sent up with the Horse, it might without all question have been taken; they
within being so secure, that some of the Lord Lisles Horse at their first
coming found the gates wide open, whereat they entered, but for want of Voot to
make it good, they were forced to retire.

When the Earl of Ormond supposed the Rebels were prepared to receive him, the
Army was brought before the Town (though he had prepared nothing fit for a
siege, and that it was contrary to the intention of the State, that he should
engage before any place of that strength, till they had first beaten the Rebels
out of the field, being sent abroad merely to live and maintain themselves,
which could not but be known impossible, lying in the midst of an enemies
Country before a Town, the Rebels having a strong Army on foot to cut off all
provision, and forage as they pleased. You may remember I told you before, how
that the Earl of Ormond, before he would stir out of Dublin, must have the
command of all the shiping on the coast of the Kingdom, and (to make some good
use of this power (he calls up two ships that lay near the Fort of Duncannon,
and on pretense to hinder supplies from coming to the Town over the River from
Munster side, they were commanded by him into such a place, that they were both
taken, to the great loss of the owners, and the encouragement of his
Countrymen; and having, with the expense almost of all his ammunition, made a
breach in the wall, wide enough for twenty men to enter a breast, having thereby
let the world see what he could have done, he rises from before it, and sets
his face homewards toward Dublin, and in his way brings the Army upon the
Rebels Forces, commanded be Preston add Cullin; where if Gods mercy had not
overcome his wickedness, the loss of those men had been in humain reason the
ruin of the English through the whole Kingdom.

The Rebels, contrary to their usual manner (being spurred on with other
assurances then they could receive from their own cowardly dispositions) at
this time charged very resolutely, on our side the Earl of Ormond gave out no
orders for the ordering or managing of the battle, but rid up and down
carelessly with one Colonel Barry an Irish Papist, and one very well known by
the Rebels, as if he had not been conterned in the business in hand: by which
means for want of direction, the Rebels had at first gotten advantage over us,
which the Earl of Ormond had a special care to impute to such as he knew most
forward and zealous against his Countrymen, and particularly to the Lord
Lisle, who in truth behaved himself: that day very gallantly, to his great
honor and the advantage of the service.

It pleased God, notwithstanding all the Earl of Ormonds wishes and
endeavors, to give the English the day, with the loss of many of the Rebels
Gentry, and diverse taken prisoners, amongst whom was Cullin, their Lieutenant
general, and some more of their principal Officers, who were brought to
Dublin in such state, that one would have thought they had rid in triumph after
their own victory, and not been prisoners of ours: And when the honest party
at Counsell-board spoke of committing them as Traitors, the Earl of Ormond
took it very hainously, and said, he would be bound for them himself, and the
Lord Chancellor one Sir Richard Bolton, a rotten-hearted man, and one of the
Earl of Ormonds honest instruments on all occasions, desired it might be
considered how the King used the Parliament prisoners here, that so they might
follow that president; to which the Earl of Ormond added, that they in England
were as great Rebels as those in Ireland, though Sir Henry Tichborne (another
faithful Gentleman, whom we shall have occasion anon to mention more at large)
upon another occasion went a note higher, and would prove the Parliament here
the worse Rebels of the two, for these (said he, meaning the Rebels) fight for
the substance of their Religion, but the Parliament merely for ceremonies.

It pleased GOD to bestow upon the FORCES of the Protestants there, Marcus.
very many admirable Victories, and nevertheless (which seemed very strange to
us, not knowing to what cause to impute it) the affairs of the English were
(so far as I could understand) still in the same condition, and not in any
degree bettered, or nearer to an end.

You say very true Sir, Decius.
for though God had put many happy opportunities into our hands, there was
never any use made of any of them, but our Armies having beaten the Rebels
abroad, were presently brought home to feed upon, and indeed devour our selves
at home: I know Sirs, you expect a fter this last victory to hear of a
pursuit, but the E. of Ormond had a care not to break his old custom; whereas
if he had pursued this defeat, as a General ought, and an honest man would
have done, he might have gone either back again to Rosse or to Kilkenny, and
had either or both delivered unto him, or at least he might have commanded the
open field, and maintained the Army upon the country without danger as long as
he pleased: The Lord Esmond (after the battle) offering to bring the Army into
the old English Baronies near Wexford, a place plentifully stored with corn
and cattle, and all manner of provision for them to subsist on: The motion was
rejected by the Earl of Ormond, and as if he had undertaken this, as a journey
only to visit some friends, within a little more then three weeks he returns
to Dublin; the money he received for this expedition (besides what he had in
provision) being sufficient to have fed that proportion of men in Town for
three months; and least the honest party at counsell-board might have disposed
otherwise of those Forces, he never gave the State notice of his intentions
till the Army was far advanced into our own Quarters, and were come within
some few miles of the City, and then he writ, that he could not keep the men
abroad any longer unless he had provisions sent to him, but never stayed for
an answer; so that before what provisions were to be gotten could be dispatched
away to him, he was come with the men to the Town's end; and this he did when
he knew there was not three days subsistence for them in the stores, but they
were all billeted upon the City; of which burden the Irish Papists had the
least share: by the Earl of Ormonds Order many able Irish in and about the
City being wholly spared, and their load laid upon the shoulders of the poor
English families, who had hardly bread for their own mouths, but they must be
brought to the extremest misery that was possible, that they might be the
better fitted and prepared willingly to accept of whatsoever he should be
pleased to do with them: and notwithstanding all this, none seemed more
sensible of the misery of the English then himself: the burden of his song was
continually, Necessity, Necessity, that the Parliament had utterly forsaken us,
and converted the money raised for us to their own uses, and that it behooved
us to provide what way we could for our own safeties, since it was impossible
any longer to hold out a war: All his work at Counsell-board was, to cry like
the two daughters of the Horse leech, Give, Give, and to press the Counsel to
write dispairing Letters to his Majesty, that so his Majesty might have grounds
to command him to conclude a Cessation (as his Majesty has since made use of
those Letters to justify himself therein (as you Marcus observed very righty
in the beginning.)

I had almost forgot one passage which falls in with this place, and may be
worth your hearing. The Lord Lisle having notice (after the Battle) that one of
our Soldiers (being taken by the Rebels upon quarter) was afterward in cold
blood hanged by them, desired the Earl of Ormond (to terrify them from
committing the like villainy upon the rest, if peradventure they had or should
have any more in their hands) that some of their men taken by us at that time,
might be used in the same manner: To which the Earl of Ormond scornfully
replied, that if they were barbarours, he would not be barbarous too: Upon this
confidence that the Rebels had in the Earl of Ormond (though there were many
more prisoners of theirs in our power, then they had of ours, which might have
made them hold their hands) they never failed to execute the worst of their
cruelties, Captain Bret taken by the Rebels, after quarter given, was in cold
blood shot to death by them; Captain Chambers, taken near Carelowe upon
quarter, was afterward delivered by Preston to one Harpoole at Kilkenny, and
by him most barbarously murdered; one young Cornet to the Lord Lisle taken near
Dublin (after long imprisonment) was afterward hanged; Captain Treswell (who
commanded the Lord Lisles Troop) petitioned the Earl of Ormond for reparation
for Young, and an examination upon oath concerning Captain Chambers, of the
inhumain cruelties executed upon him, was presented to the Earl of Ormond and
he moved to require satisfaction, but his Lordship was angry, and nothing was
done in either; and yet though his Lordship were so much out of love with that
barbarous virtue of justice, he delighted as much on the other side in mercy,
and therefore when there was a plot discovered, that a whole company of Irish
men conspired together to run from their Garrison at Rings End to the Rebels,
and but one of them was picked out to suffer for example (the Earl of Ormond
being unwilling that any one should dye for so good a work, whilst he had
power to hinder it,) he was reprieved by him, and afterward saved, and an
Irish Cutler in Dublin being condemned for furnishing the Rebels with arms,
was by the Earl of Ormonds earnest solicitation afterward acquitted; and
there are so many other particular instances of his affection to spare his
Countrymen, that (having so many things to acquaint you with after this taste
that I have already given you) to repeat them would be as unnecessary as
tedious to you.

After this that you have already told us, Civilis.
I do not see what can be further added to make his disaffection and
naughtiness more evident, you have given us in this one business of the
disappointment of the Lord Lisles proposition, and the Earl of Ormonds pursuit
of it; so complete a series and chain of mischief, that I cannot tell how you
will be able to add one link to it.

What you have heard, Decius.
is but a piece of one Act, one scene only of that Tragedy which to this day
is ours, but in the end (I doubt not) but will prove the authors, if our sins
do not keep back his punishment.

Notwithstanding these and many such like carriages of the Earl of Ormond, and
what might have been apprehended by the Parliament, of greatest disaffection in
them; such was their zeal to the service of Ireland, and their preservation of
the remaining English there, and so much care did they express therein, as in
the very height of the distempers of this Kingdom, when all was little enough
for themselves, and though they saw how much of the provisions made for Ireland
was intercepted in its way thither (as at Chester and other places) they
continued still doing good to us, and furnished us, though not so plentifully
as was desired, yet (considering their condition) in such measure, as we had no
cause to complain of them, or despair of our selves; if there had been that
use made of those supplies as might have been, had not the Earl of Ormond
hindered it, who (by this goodness of the Parliament toward the Protestants)
was so far from being raisen to the least joy or thankfulness, that it was
the grief of his soul, that (by showing any care of us) they put back the
work he had in hand to our ruin; and therefore he used all means that could
be invented to waste and squander away what we received from them, and so to
disoblige them, that for the future they might be drawn to desist from sending
any more money or provisions to an army they saw so adverse to them.

About the beginning of July 1643. Captain Thomas Bartlet was sent into
Ireland with his Ship laden with corn and other provisious, and another Ship
stored with three hundred barrels of powder and a great proportion of match;
both which arrived at Dublin about two months before the cessation; at which
time the Earl of Ormond thought the English were reduced to such necessity,
that it was impossible for them to subsist without the cessation; but by the
arrival of this supply, finding himself disappointed, he was not a little
troubled, but he soon found out a way to piece his work up again; and to empty
the stores once more (as he had done often before to as little purpose) he
pretends a journey in all haste toward Castle Jordon, and thereupon hurries up
to Dublin most of the Forces that were garrisoned in Drogheda, alias, Tredagh,
Trym and Dondalke, where they remained feeding upon the stores of that place
many days before his Lordship could be ready to martch out; and having at
length sent out the Lord Lambert before him with a party of the Army (who
either through the Earl of Ormonds command or his own cowardice, durst not
advance further then twelve miles from the City, but kept his men there,
feeding upon what they carried abroad with them;) he himself at last martched
out to him, his whole strength consisting of about five thousand, besides Horse
and a great train of Artillery; and having kept the men abroad till they had
consumed their provision, he brought them home again, without doing any manner
of service against the Rebels, only he took in an ordinary dwelling house,
unfortified, possessed by some fevv of the Rebels: yet before his Lordship
could be ready to martch out and do these brave exploits, all the money that
could be raked from the Excise, and what could be torn from the poor English,
and almost all the provision that Captain Bartlet had brought in was consumed;
and of what remained, part was privately sold to several Bakers and others in
the City of Dublin, and part concealed and removed into private Granaries till
after the cessation, that it might not appear to hinder it, Sir Philip
Percivel was Commissary of the Victuals in Ireland at that time. Sir Philip
Percivel was employed as Clarke or Secretary to write all the passages at the
making of the cessation on the Lord of Ormonds part.
and then some of it was sold, and the money converted to private uses, and the
rest, instead of being useful to send out the Army to fight against the
Rebels, was made into Bisquet, to victual the Regiments sent into England (to
fight against the Parliament) in Captain Weaks Ships: The ways the Earl of
Ormond took to consume our provisions to no purpose, were so many and so
apparent, that the Parliament Commissioners then at Dublin were bold to tell
him plainly, That were the Parliament Masters of the wealth of the Indies, as
things were carried there, it would be all spent, and yet the English not any
thing the better for it. By this taste that I have already given you, you may
see how he labored all that he could to consume what was sent from hence, or
to dispose of it so, that it might not stand in the way between him and his
design, for the preservation of his Countrymen, by necessitating the English
to accept of his cessation or peace.

The next thing which I shall labor to clear to you, is the course the Earl
of Ormond took to alienate the Parliament of England from sending any more
supplies to us, knowing to how little purpose it would be, to dry up the water
in the streams, unless he could stop it at the springhead: But I believe
this will be a work to overcome your patience, having (I presume) wearied it
alrerdy.

Civilis and Marcus protesting they received the greatest contentment and
satisfaction in hearing of him, he went on in this manner.

The Earl of Ormond having been very succesfull in the first part of his game,
and drawn us to the bottom, bethinks himself at the same time, how to free
himself of the Parliament, whom he found more forward to assist us, then would
stand with the work he had in hand, and therefore labors to disoblige them so,
that the English being left wholly to themselves, he might the easier make his
hand of them. From hence arose those many reviling speeches uttered by himself
and his instruments upon all occasions against this Parliament and Kingdom:
himself always having a special care not only to equal them with his
Countrymen, but to put the Parliament above them (as if the Rebellion and
Massacre there were a business to be excused in comparison of their
proceedings here) saying, that those fought only (at the worst) against his
Majesty's subjects, but these against his person, and that the Parliament here
was the cause of all the misery of that Kingdom; and therefore in the preample
