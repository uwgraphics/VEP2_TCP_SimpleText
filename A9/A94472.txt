TO THE Honorable the COMMONS House Of PARLIAMENT: The humble Petition of the
Ministers of the City of London.
Humbly shows;
THat your Petitioners with joyfulnesse have entertained, and with all
thankfulness do acknowledge the frequent and affectionate expressions of your
pious resolutions for the firm settling of this Churches peace, especially in
your first Remonstrance; wherein you are pleased to declare, That it is far
from your thoughts, purpose or desire, to let loose the golden reins of
Discipline and Government in the Church; to leave private persons or
particular Congregations to take up what form of service they please; As
likewise in the late National COVENANT, wherein both Houses of Parliament and
the three Kingdoms stand solemnly engaged to the MOST HIGH GOD, for a full
Reformation and uniformity in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government,
and in Convening an Assembly of godly and Learned Divines for that end.

Yet notwithstanding, sore are the pressures under which we groan; Give us
leave therefore we beseech you (in pursuance of our National COVENANT) to sigh
out our sorrows at the feet of this HONORABLE SENATE.

Through many erroneous opinions, ruinating Schisms and damnable heresies
(unhappily fomented in City and Country) the Orthodox Ministry is neglected;
the people seduced; Congregations torn asunder; families distracted; rights
and duties of relations, National, Civil and Spiritual, scandalously
violated; the power of godliness decayed; Parliamentary Authority undermined;
fearful confusion introduced; imminent destruction threatened, and in part
inflicted upon us lately in the West;

May it therefore please your Wisdoms (as a sovereign remedy for the
removal (as we humbly conceive) of our present miseries and prevention of
their farther progress) to expedite a Directory for public Worship, and to
accelerate the establishment of a pure Discipline and Government (according to
the Word of GOD and the example of the best Reformed Churches) and to take away
all obstructions that may impede and retard our humble desires.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray, etc.
This Petition was by the Ministers of the City of London, presented to the
Honorable House of COMMONS, September. 18, 1644. And received with great
acceptance.
