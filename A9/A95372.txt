A Heavenly Conference for Sions SAINTS, To enlighten themselves, and teach
their Children. Together, With the SAINTS Belief. By John Turner, a prisoner
of Jesus Christ, in Gardiners Lane, Westminster.

Mal. 3. 16. 17. Then spoke they that feared the Lord, every one to his
neighbor, and the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a book of remembrance was
written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his
name. And they shall be to me, says the Lord of hosts, in that day that I
shall do this, for a flock, and I will spare them, as a man spares his own
son that serves him. Deuteronomy. 6. 6. 7. And these words which I command thee
this day, shall be in thine heart. And thou shall rehearse them continually unto
thy children, and shall talk of them when thou tariest in thine house, and as
thou walk by the way, and when thou lie down, and when thou risest up.
Luke 2. 46, 47. And it came to pass three days after, that they found him in
the Temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking
them questions. And all that heard him, were astonished at his understanding and
answers. Printed in the year 1645.

Psalm. 16. 3. Most excellent SAINTS of SION.
Our only Lord has taught, that Light is come into the world, and men loved
darkness rather then light, because Joh. 3. 19.
their deeds were evil, whereby the Book of God has been sealed with seven
seals, that Rev. 5. 1, (...), 9.
none could look into the truth thereof, which has caused people to leave the
foundation of true faith (the written word) and believe as the Church and
Priests believe. But the lion of the tribe of Judah, of the root of David, has
opened the same, to the terror of his enemies, and comfortable refreshing of
his beloved Saints.

And because they could not prevail to hide all Rev. 6. 14.
truth, they rouled up as a scroule Christ's kingdom of power, and
Church Government (denying Luke 9. 1^.
him to reign over them) which has caused Christ's word to be contemned, as
insufficient for prudency in performing Divine Ordinances, and 2 Timothy, 3, 16, 17.
thereby have caused the people to follow that government which the Priests do
appoint them, changing the manner of worship, as gallants change 2 Pet. 5. 15.
Prove. 24, 21.
their fashions, ever now and then in a new shape.

And lest their evil should be espied, they have caused 4 Angels to hold the 4
winds of Christ's Rev. 7. 1.
Church, power and government, that they should not blow upon the Earth, Sea,
or any Trees, by which Locusts do rise out of the smoke of the bottomless
Rev. 9. 3. 17.
pit, and with the fire, smoke, and brimstone, which has proceeded out of
their mouths, they have darkened the third part of the Sun-light of Rev. 8.
12, and 9, 18.
the Gospel, the third part of the inferior moonlight of the Law, and the
third part of the truth of Christ's ministry, and thereby caused the powers of
the Earth to reele to and fro like a Drunkard, and Esaias 24. 20. Rev. 6. 16. 17.
quake, and say, alas, alas we know not what to do; hide us from the presence
of the Lamb, for his wrath (in his regal power and Church Government is come)
and we cannot stand, for he will condem^e (without respect of persons) all
evil^ Government and Governors, Worship and Worshippers; and then you shall be
so borne up on every side with earthen props, that men shall not dare speak
against this Beast, neither teach Jesus Rev. 13.
Christ to be the Savior of the world (what gifts soever God indu^ them with)
without a license from these evil angels, or Patentees of the Gospel.

But the good Angel (notwithstanding these) has sealed the Servants of God in
the fore* lead, Rev. 7, 2. 3.
authorizing them to teach all his truths among all his people in all earthly
dominions, by virtue Only Mark 16. 15.
of his power, and requires them so to do, upon pain of his displeasure: by
whose authority I here Act, 4. 19:
employ my mean talent, (without their license) knowing, that it is better to
obey God them man, and to set forth the whole truth of God revealed unto me
that I may be guiltless of the blood of Act. 20, 26, 27
all men.

And having obtained this honor of the Lord once again, to be a prisoner for
maintaining his truth (this being the seventh time of my imprisonment, and
fifteenth year, no cause having ever being showed) cannot choose but speak by
writing, I (being set of the Lord apart thereunto, and taken Act, 4, 20. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 8.
off from all other employments) that ignorance (whereof God will be revenged
in flames of fire) may be expelled; Faith, steadfastness, and true worship
embraced: these evil angels (by the word of Christ's mouth) prevented in their
mischievous Rev. 9. 6. Exodus 10. 19. Rev. 18. 21.
hiding the truth; and the Locusts (that with their heads and tails make men
weary of their lives) by the West-wind of Gods favor blown into the Sea,
appointed for their destruction.

Beloved, it is for the unfolding of Gods truth, and thy good, that I have
penned the same, following the example of the Lamb, who discovered the
Pharisees iniquity, and unfolded the truth, by Luke 2, 46, 47.
questioning with them, and answering them again, whose practice is my
president: And though the Penman were not a Prophet, (as many call Prophets)
neither the son of a Prophet; yet I Amos. 7. 14.
pray thee, in the fear of God, read it carefully, try it diligenly, judge
unpartially, and embrace it lovingly, and refuse not what thou see appear to
be truths herein, but yield conscionably to practice the same, and teach it
unto thy children faithfully, with all diligence; remembering that God, for the
good of his, will bring (...) Cor. 4, 6. 1 Cor. 1, 27, 28 29.
light out of darkness, making foolish things confound wise, and weak
strong, and has chosen base things, and things that are not, to bring to
naught things that are, lest men should rejoice in their A^ery humane learning,
as in these Rev. 16. 17.
days too much they do.

I humbly beseech you, in the fear of God, Jam 21. Heb. 1^. 6. Heb. 10. 37. 38.
have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, in respect of persons, neither
fear persecution for well doing; look not back, preferring worldly friends
before Christ's truth, God will be a better Mark 10. 19.
friend unto thee, then all thou can lose for his sake, giving thee ^n
hundred fold recompense in this life, and in the world to come life
everlasting.

AMEN.

they received their bodies.

Q. Did man condescend unto this Covenant which God made with him?

A. He went about the covenanted work, Genesis 3. 2, 3. and 17. 10. 23. Math.
21. 28, 29, 30, 31.
which proves agreement.

For if one speak and the other goes about the work, it proves consent.

Q. Did not the Lord force man to this Covenant?

A. By no other means then setting the reward Genesis 2. 9. 16. 17. Esaias 2. 3.
Psalm. 110. 3. 2 Cor. 9. 13. Genesis 2. 15, 17.
before him.

Q. What was the condition God made with man?

For Angels are servants to man in the Paradise estate.

Q. How came man to be greater then Satan who was an Angel of Light?

A. By the covenanted gift, wherein he had Paradise given him.

For man was not created heir of Paradise, Psalm 8, 6, 7, 8. 9. Gal. 4. 23.
but Lord of the Earth, and heir of heaven by promise.

Q. How came the Fishes, Beasts and Birds to lose their right?

A. By the fall of their Lord, and help they Genesis 3. 6. 13. Romans 8. 16.
used to betray him.

16. 10. Levit. ^5. 44. 2 Chr. 8. 7, 8. Jer. 15. 19.
Gibbonites, Hittites, Gargashites, Hivites, unclean Isralites, or any

the mingled seed of worldly power and spiritual jurisdiction.

by Satan, under Gods curse in all external things, both concerning this life,
and that which is to come.

necessity) and all works of worship, required in the written word.

Qu. Why is the word Remember prefixed to this fourth Commandment, and to no
other?

annexed more Eze. 20. 12. Col. 2. 17.
specially to this Commandment then to any other.

Q. What is the residue of the fourth Commandment?

A. Time for Gods worship: for if a God 1 Co^. 2. 4.
be acknowledged and worshipped; there must be a time for it: but this or that
time, or day, knows no man by nature.

Q. What is the Antitipe (or substance) Col. 2. 16, 17. Matthew. 11. 28. 1 Pet
4. 14. Exo. 16 23 and 23. (...), 12. Lev. 23. 36. Acts 9. 31. Acts 20. 7. 4-9.
Heb. 4. 10. 11. Rev. 14. 13
of the shadow, that the seven days holy rest figureth out unto us?

A. Rest in Christ, rest in the Gospel, Church, rest on the first day of the
week, (on which Christ finished our redemption) and our everlasting rest in the
glorious heavens.

Q. Wherefore was the command of keeping holy the seventh day enjoined?

A. That we should rest, and all we have from Exodus 20. 10.
worldly labor.

he the Lord sanctifies us in Christ.

3. To teach us our rest is in Christ, only, and Col. 2. 17.
not in our selves,

4. That there is a rest for us in heaven, where Heb. 4. 10, 11.
Christ is entered, which yet we enjoy not.

Q. Which is the seventh day the Jews kept holy?

A. The day before the first day of the week, Mat 28. (...). John 30. 1. 19
which Christ's Disciples now keep holy.

Q. How comes the 7. days Sabbath altered to the first day of the week?

A. Christ who made it changed it: as he Col. 3. 16. Heb. 4. 8, 9. 1 Cor. 16.
3. Rev. 1. 10
changed the worship, so he did the time: and as the second Commandment is in
force, though the Ordinance be changed: so is the fourth Commandment, though
the time be changed.

Q. Could Christ alter it? was it not Moral?

A. The 7. days Institution was a shadow R vel. 12. 5. (...) Cor. 5. 17. ^say
43. 19.
fulfilled by himself: wherefore he made all new, Ordinances, Order, and Time.
Yet all the ten Commandments are of force, as of old, and every transgression
is a breach of them, and every 1 Timothy 1. 9.
transgressing Israelite to be punished (alike) by them.

Q. Are we bound to keep any day holy, wherein we may not do worldly work?

A. Yes, the first day of the week. Acts 20. 7. 1 Cor. 16. 2.


1. For if the 4. Commandment enjoyne not a set day for Gods worship

matters of the worship of their God.

Q. May not one then join with the Ministers of England, in their Churches?

Masons book, set forth Act. 6. 3. Ezekiel. 33. 2. Act. 14. 23. 1 Cor. 16. 3. Act.
1. 23. 26.
by authority) and the Pope from Satan, themselves affirm in their preaching
commonly.

Whereas Christ's Minister is from the Church he serves in.

Deuteronomy. 5. 32. Rev. 22. 18, 19. and 10. 9, 10. 1 Corin. 11. 2. 1 Chro^. 15. 13.
reading for prayer, a false Article in their Faith, blasphemy in the
administration of the Lords Supper, in that they acknowledge Archangels when
there is but one Archangel Christ Jesus, crossing, kneeling, etc.

Whereas Christ's Church must read only Gods divine word: and according to the
same direction therein, administer, confess, and perform Jer. 1. 7, 8. 2. 2 Timothy 3. 16, 17. Gal. 3. 15. Psalm. 19. 7, 8, 9. Prove. 30. 5.
prayer, not adding to his order in any circumstance in the performance of his
Ordinances.

3. In power, theirs is by a Commissaries Court, or earthly authority in the
new Church model. 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5. 2 Cor. 2. 7, 8, 9, 10. Mat. 18. 17. 20.


Whereas Christ's Church is only by his own Ecclesiastical or divine power
within the same.

4. In place, theirs are holy by their own making and yet stand undemolished.

Pro. 15. 1. 1 Cor. 16. 14. 2 Samuel 12. 1. Romans 16. 17.


6. Use moderate speeches with love and wisdom to persuade him from it.

Q. If I see my brother sin, may I not tell another, before I have told him?

practice, and they cursed that do it.

Q. What is that Church which is mingled with all sorts of people, profane and
wicked?

A. It is a Church of confusion, where the Rev. 18. 1. 4. 2 Cor. 6. 14. 17, 18.
1 Timothy 6. 4, 5. Acts 19. 9.
Lords people may not tarry.

Q. What is that Church which was never contracted or covenanted together to be
a church?

A. An adulterous practiser, and stealer of Prove 9. 13. 17, 18. and 5. 3, 4.
Dan. 11. 22, 23. Ier. 3. 14. Ephesians 5. 23.
that she bestows upon the people.

1. Ephesians. 4. 16. Neh. 9. 38. and 10. 28.
For without a Covenant, many cannot become a body, neither in divine nor
humane things.

2. If they could, the children of Israel need not to have covenanted when they
came out of Babell.

3. Neither a man with a maid to make her Math. 1. 18. Luke 1. 27.
his wife.

Q. What is that particular Church that has not Christ's power among
themselves, (without the help of any) to excommunicate?

1. 18. Romans 1. 13. Matthew. 15. 20.


For Christ will be with that his Church power, where ever his Church is.

As a King will be with his power of judgment where his Assize is held.

Q. what is the matter whereof Antichrists Church is made?

A. A company (externally compelled by civil authority) of visible, profane,
blind zealous Ier. 15. 17. 19. Rev. 13. 16. and 18. 1. Isay 1. 2.
dissemblers, and ignorant persons, which condemn in others, what they practice
themselves and any other that will, if they by threatening and punishing can make
them say and swear as they would have them.

Q. Is none of Gods Elect in Babel, or in a^ Antichristian Church?

A. There is; but they are not of that Church neither is it lawful for them to
continue therein. Revel. 18. 4. 1 John 2. 19.


Q. what is that makes men to be visibly on^ with an Anti-christaan Church?

A. Joining and submitting together under Dan. 11. 23. Romans 6. 16.
their commanded orders.

Q. What is that which makes men contin^^ Antichrists subjects?

A. The fear of punishment, ignorance of the Revel. 13. 15.
truth, and worldly riches gained by that service. Matthew. 23. 34. Revel. 12. 4.


Q. What are the marks whereby we may know Babel, or an Antichristian Church?

A. By altering of Gods Ordinances or order, Isay 24. 5. Dan. 11. 31. Matthew.
24. 15. Mar. 13. 14. 2 Cor. 10. 4. and 1 24. Mat. 24. 9. Act. 12. 4.
and placing of men's inventions in the stead thereof, compulsion to divine
obedience by civil authority, forcing men against their consciences to say as
they would have: and imprisoning those that cannot yield unto them.

Q. What is the power which Antichrist has left unto his Churches?

A. It is wicked Articles, and mischievous Luke 6. 22. Matthew. 23. 15.
tale-telling, is appointed for Courts to open and shut hell therewith, that
Satan servants may be forced in, and they being in shall not get out.

Q. Are the Lords children ever the worse for the Antichristian Churches (or
courts) excommunication, or punishment?

A. No: they are much the better, for they Luke 6. ^2, 23 Ioh. 16. 2. Mat. 5.
10, 11. Mark 10. 29. 30.
have particular promises of Gods favor more then before.

Q. Is not one church of Antichrist inferior to another, and tied to obey
their impositions, or the impositions of some Antichristian assembly of their
Divines?

Answ. They are, as appears by their Lady Whores of Canterbury and York, with
the slavish pandering Churches, they (and their Antichristian assembly of
Divines) reign over.

Q. Does not the giving of the Sacrament, and preaching of the Word make a true
Church?

Ans. No: then one lying in a Jail among Je^em. 7. 10. 1 Kings 13. 2. Amos 4.
4. 5. M^cha 1. and 6. 16. 2. Acts 13. 2, 10. 12.
Thieves and Murderers, preaching the Word, and giving the Sacrament, make
these Thieves a true Church: for the Lord abhorred Shilo for the wickedness of
the Priests: and Dan and Bethel, though they had Gods Ordinances among them.

Q. May not the child of God stand a member of one of the Churches of England,
or Antichrist?

A. He may not: because none of the Churches of England were set up of Christ,
neither are any of them governed by him.

They were not set up of Christ, neither in Matter, Gathering, Joining,
Ministry, Maintenance, Acts, nor Order.

earthly Proclamation.

When Christ's people must freely come together into a Church, (only) by the

3. In Joining: they of the Churches of England Act. 2. 37. 40. and 4. 1. 4.
and 16. 14, 15. 34. and 8. 5, 12,

first together.

Ephesians. 5. 23 Nehem. 9. 38. Genesis 17. 7. 9, 10, 11. Heb. 13. 20 Act. 3. 25. Heb.

Ordinance Act. 6. 3. Eze. 33. 2. Acts 14. 23. 1 Cor. 16. 3. Act. 1. 23. 26.
from an Antichristian Bishop, and a license from him, or the Presbyters.

Church of England live by Tithes, Gleabs, and Offerings, etc.

When Christ's Ministers must live by the free gift of the Church whereof they
are, if they receive for their Ministry any thing.

6. In acts: They of the Churches of England have a false Article in their
Faith, blasphemy Ier. 1 7, 8 and 2. 2. 2 Timothy 3. 16, 17. Gal 3. 15. Psalm. 19.
7, 8, 9. Prove. 30. 5, 6. Deu^ 4. 2. 5, 6. 1 Timothy 6. 3. 4, 5.
in the Administration of the Sacrament, in that they acknowledge Archangels,
when there is but one Archangel, Christ Jesus: and a humane Service or
Directory-booke to read unto the people.

When Christ's Church must read only his divine Word, and according to the same
Word administer, confess, and perform prayer.

7. In Order: they of the Churches of England, Iam. 2 1. Heb. 8. 5. Deuteronomy. 5. 32.

1 Cor. 11 2. 1 Chr. 15. 13.
rich before the poor in the Church, (in respect of this worlds goods) neither
add to his order in any circumstance in the performance of his Ordinances.

In Government:
Theirs of the Churches of England is by the power of a Commissaries Court, or
some other earthly power newly established.

within his own Church.

Q. May not the child of God lawfully pray with the Ministers of the Church of
England, in their Churches?

A. They may not; for they give acknowledgement Hag. 2 12, 13. Isa. 42. 8. Math
23. 9, 10
of making Divine Laws for the order of worship to worldly Magistrates, and
blaspheme in their prayers, in giving Primate, Metropolitan, Lord, Grace,

belongs only to the Lord Jesus, and his Honor he will not give unto any
creature.

17 John 10. 1.


2. For they ought not so long as they so stand to take Gods name in their
mouths.

3. For the Lords servants will not follow them who are strange in office
toward him.

4. For my presence is an encouraging them in their Corasiticall practices.

For if none would hear, they would not preach.

5. If I may hear them who are strange in office Mat. 1. 24, 25. 34. and 3. 1^,
12, Luke 8. 28, 29.
to Christ, I may hear the Pope or devil, if he as Satan will preach Gods
Word unto me. Yet Christ would not permit Satan to say, he was the Son of God.

Q. How can it be unlawful to hear some of the Ministers of the Church of
England, (of the old stamp, or new form) seeing they are very good men?

A. It is impossible for any man to be a good Mat. 23 Number. 16. 1 King. 18. 19,
and 22. 24.
man, holding a wicked office, (more then for a thief to be an honest man
continuing stealing) their goodness is but color, it is not substance (as
proves) if you touch their Honor, or Riches that should maintain the same.

Q. How can so many men of great learning, (being new sealed with the old
stamp) be deceived?

A. There were 450. false Prophets in King 1 King. 13 19: and 22. 6.
Ahabs time, and very few true to stand against them, (and there are far more
learned Papists stamped with the Priesthood then of England) 2 Pet. 2. 1. John
4. 1. 2 Timothy 4. 3.
and as there were false Prophets that did deceive, so there are and shall be.

Q. How can it be unlawful, to be a member, pray, or hear Gods Word taught
in the Churches of England, seeing Conversion is in them?

A. Conversion is not in any of the Churches Gal. 4. 26.
of England, otherwise then the Word of God is among them; which Word converts
or condemns always in all places, and from the Word I acknowledge none may
depart. 1 Timothy 6. 3, 4, 5, 6 Romans 16. 17. Ierem. 15. 17.


But from the Priests and people where the Word of God is taught, and had with
Instituted Ceremonies of men's Inventions, which they will not amend; all that
will have assurance Math 7. 22, 23 Mat. 5. 19, 20, 21, 22.
they are the Lords Children, must depart, and there may not abide.

Because such Priests and People so continuing, are rejected of the Lord.

2. For their doings and themselves in divine Psalm 101. 3. Prove. 29. 27.
worship is abominable unto the Lord and all his Saints.

3. Such people make a worship to themselves. Phil. 3. 19.


4 If it be not so, we need not have refused the Congregated worship in Rome,
but do wickedly in standing against them.

Q. Where were you Converted, seeing you were not converted in the Church of
England?

A. In Jerusalem from above, which is the G^l 4: 16, 27. Psalm. 87. 5, 6. Esaias
54. 1.
mother of all Gods Elect,

Q. What is Jerusalem from above?

A. It is Christ and his Gospel. 1 Cor. 4. 15.


Q. How know you Jerusalem from above to be Christ and his Gospel?

A. Because God the Father preached it. Genesis 3. 15.


The seed of the woman shall break the Serpents Gallat. 38.
head: and there shall be enmity between the woman's seed, and the Serpents.

And in him all Nations shall be blessed. Matthew. 1. 21. Acts 4. 12.


And he shall save his people from their sins.

There being no other name under heaven given, whereby we must be saved.

EZEKIEL 33. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Son of man, speak to the children of thy people,
and say unto them, When I bring the Sword upon a land; if the people of the
land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman,

If when he sees the sword come upon the land, he blow the Trumpet and warn
the people,

Then whosoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and takes not warning, if
the sword come and take him away, his blood shall be upon his ownn head.

He heard the sound of the Trumpet, and took not warning, his blood shall be
upon him: but he that takes warning, shall deliver his soul.

But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the Trumpet, and the
people be not warned: if the sword come and take any person from among them, he
is taken away in his iniquity: but his blood will I require at the watch-mans
hands.

By me JOHN TURNER, Prisoner of our Lord Jesus Christ (committed by the
Bishops) near 14. years, for affirming Christ Jesus has left in his written
Word sufficient direction to order his Church and children in his worship: So
that nothing may be done, over not above, nor besides, what is commanded
therein by a Precept and example, or a true gathered consequence, which I dare
not but affirm, though I dye for the same. And now delivered, (as abusively
imprisoned all this time) by the most Honorable Lords in Parliament, 1641.

Q. May not the English Service-Booke be ^^ad and obeyed in the Church of
Christ?

A. No; the Service-Booke may not, be^use Mark. 8. 15. Isay 29. 13. Math. 15.
8. 9. Amos 6, 5, 13, 14. Jer. 44. 16.
it is invented by man, contrary to the commandments of God, and besides, it
is ^illed with errors, untruths, and blasphemies, yea, and contradictions to
his word.

First, Invented by man, in that the Con^^ocation Isay 66. 3. Rev. 22. 19: 20.
of Bishops and Priests, or Clergy^en made it, contrary to these Scriptures.

Secondly, Errors, in that they pray for the very damned, in these words: All
that ^^vell by land or by water, when they have Joh. 17. 9. 19. 20 Romans 9. 27.
1 John 5. 16.
^rayed for Gods Children before, con^rarie to

Thirdly, Untruths, in that it holds forth, that the Priests or Ministers
have power to Mar. 2. 7. 8. 9.
^^^give sins in their Visitation of the sick, which ^ contrary to

Fourthly, Blasphemy, in that it acknowledg^^^ Jud. 9. Jam. 4. 12. Mat. 23. 9,
10, 11. Luk, 22, 25.
Archangels, and does attribute the ti^les of Primate, Lord, Grace, and
Reverend ^ather in God, to wicked and ungodly men, contrary to

Fifthly, Contradictions to Gods word, in Rev. 13. 17. and 149, 10, and 15. 2
Col. 2. 20, 21, 22, 23. Gal. 2. 4, 5, and 1, 10. Act. 17. 30. 1 Timothy 2. 8. Rev.
22. 17. ^say 55, 1, 2.
that it adds the Cross to Baptism, kneeling to the Lords Supper, holiness
to their Church high places, and purse-penalties for their offenders, contrary
to

Q. May not the Directory-Booke be read and obeyed in the Church of Christ?

A. The Directory-Booke may not, because Christ has made a better, wiser, more
ancient, and more infallible book of direction, 2 Timothy 3. 15. Rev. 22. 18. 19
Joh. 12. 48. Deuteronomy. 5. 32.
for to direct his Church in his written word then that is, by which all shall
be judged at the last day.

1. And they ^^^ bring not the first and best Deuteronomy. 18. ^. Mal. 1. 1 Cor. 12.
13.
to the sacr^fice of God, are accursed.

2. There is no word of God to warrant the making of that Directory-Booke, more
then Jeroboham had for the making of Calves of 1 King. 12.
Gold, which he set up in two high places; one at Dan, the other at Bethel, to
the confusion of himself, and his posterity.

2. This Directory-Booke is newly invented by men and has Error. Untruth, and
Contradictions to the Canonical Scriptures; yea, many directions in it that
has no word of Gods truth to hold forth the same.

First, Newly invented by men, in that the Exodus 2. 4. Romans 1. 30. Amo^ 6. ^.
Psalm, 99. 8. ^^^ 106, 29, 39. Rev. 22. 1*
Assembly of Presbyterian Divines (as they ^all themselves) made it 1644,
contrary to these Scriptures,

Secondly, Errors, in that by Baptism of Nehe. 9. 29. 2 Cor. 8. 5. Mat. 18.
20.
water they make members of their Churches, contrary to

Thirdly, Untruths, in that by receiving the 1 Cor, 11. 26. 30. 2 Cor. 13. 5.
Heb. 8. 10. 11.
Bread and Wine (in the ordinance of the Lords Supper) they say, They receive
Christ Jesus Christ, contrary to

When the exceptable receivers have 1 Cor, 11. 29. Heb. 11. 6. and ^, 11.
Christ before; and those that have not, receive their own dam^ation.

Fourthly, Contradictions to the Canonical Scriptures, in that they add a
Directory-Booke to Christ's Book, of direction in Deuteronomy. 5. 32. Rev. 22. 18. 19
Eze. 43. 8. L^k. 22. 19. Mat. 26. 2^. 27 1 John 3. 9. and 5 16. Mat. 13. 31. 32
Church worship; enjoyne all of every Parish (by earthly power) to come to
their Assemblies: command their Ministers in prayer, to acknowledge, they are
worthy of the heaviest judgment inflicted upon the most rebellious sinners,
page 9. contrary to

When Christ will have none forced (by earthly power) to come to his Churches;
neither can his Children be culpable' of tha^ Psalm. 110. 3. Mat. 13. 25. 30 1 John 5. 16. and 3 6, 9. Jude.
heavy judgment, of being guilty of sin against the holy Ghost, which the
most rebellious sinners are; and the devil sins no deeper, nor has more
judgment on him; then that of the most rebellious sinners, which is
unpardonable, past all repentance, and all prayer.

Printed for the public good of those that desire to know the truth, and that
desire the Lord Jesus Christ should reign alone Lord, Lawgiver, and King in
his Church.
