TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY.
KINGS (Mighty Sovereign) like Planets in their Orbs (under that Primum
Mobile, from whence all beings derive their existence and continuance) are
seated in their several Thrones, to rule and guide the people committed to
their charge by the sweet influence of Love, and unreprovable motion of their
justice; which axiom of State more especially directs it self to your
Majesty's consideration, who (as the Sun in respect of other Luminaries) do
shine* in a sphere of such eminency, as besides the unparalleld luster it
retains at home, does communicate its splendour to foreign parts, as a
pattern for the greatest Potentates.

And hereupon, as according to the propinquity or distance of the Sun in its
annual peregrination, the elementary bodies receive their augmentation, or
diminution accordingly: so are the hearts of all your loyal Subjects
illuminated with the presence of this gracious aspect, and miserably
overshadowed with sorrow in the least absence thereof.

But bleare eyes are no fit objects for such bright rays, nor are mean
conceits allowable subjects for Royal apprehensions; nevertheless, as the
Sun loses nothing of its splendour, when it so far declines in its beams,
to kiss the low shrubs as well as the tall Cedars, and though it be alike
diffusive to all, yet admits no taint in the touch of the vilest creature: So
if your Majesty vouchsafe to cast down a gracious eye on the humble present of
your meanest Subject (as from the hand of a more able giver) your Highness
cannot suffer much in this abasement, but your goodness shall show it self
transparent, and like that glorious mirror of all beautiful perfections.

Howsoever I durst not to have presumed thus high upon any imagination that
your Majesty wanted far better information or advise, especially from so
honorable an Assembly as that of the present Parliament; but as in a general
obstruction of water currents, it is natural for the shallowest Brooks as
deepest Rivers, to seek way for their passage; likewise in a common calamity,
the meanest (who are commonly the first sufferers) cannot be blamed for putting
a finger to the grief, nor justly constrained to express their complaints in
silence only. But if my intentions have faulted in the matter or manner,
(being errors of skill not will) I beseech your Majesty so far to bear with
either, as may pardon the presumption of him that is a daily Orator for your
Majesty's temporal, and eternal happiness;

George Raleigh.

ALBANIA, OR, Certain Concernements of GREAT BRITANNIE.
ALas poor Princess Megala! (a Mirror to show that there is no contentment
to be sought for in earthly transitories) sometimes happy in thy private
fortunes, more happy to have lived by loving Neighbors, in a Country rich in
large Provinces, potent in free States, and Princes; glorious in magnificent
Cities, stately Temples, goodly Palaces, and large Edifices; adorned with
delectable Groves, and Walks for the Muses; fenced with strong Castles,
Cittadells, and Bulwarks; graced with delightsome Gardens, curious Arbours,
Crystal Fountains, artificial Columns, Pyramids, Spires, Obeliskes;
privileged with honorable Liberties, and immunities; famous for great Marts,
inventive Crafts-men; canopyed as it were, in diverse parts, with fair Woods,
and spacious Forests, carpeted (if I may so speak) with flowery Meadows, and
verdant Pastures; hung round about with Vineyards, and Embroydered with
Corne-fields; inlayd with rich minerals; bordered with lofty Mountains,
pleasant Valleys, and Rivers abounding in most sorts of delicate Fish, and for
depth, capable of Vessels of sufficient burden, for the conveyance of its
own, and Foreign Commodity.

Alas! did I say, sometimes so happy, and must now say, ( Sic transit gloria
mundi)

So in the turning of a glass,
All worldly glory soon does pass.
Unfortunate, and most miserable Megala, in this last century of years, having
spent more then an Age in pertinacious encounters, intestine Wars, and
tragical turmoyles; lying as it were all this while, weltring in the blood of
no less then a million of Christian Souls, and Martial spirits; by means
whereof, the Plague, and Famine (seconding the cruelty of the Sword) has
ushered in the massacring and mourning of thy Nobles, the lamentable shrikes
and cries of Widows, and Orphans, the brutish ravishment of grave Matrons,
and fair Virgins, the inhumane dashing in pieces of Infants and sucklings, the
torturing of all sorts of people, by worse diabolical cruelties, then a Turk,
or Inquisition do put in practice: So that

Talia fando quis temperet a lachymis!
To speak of this,
What grief it is!
And of these heavy misfortunes, what end does there yet appear? how many
spectators, how few true compassioners have there been? whiles on one side,
the overweening Aquilinus (whose power makes the justness of his quarrel,
and his quarrel is the cause of all these troubles) strengthened with the
confederacy and aid of potent Allies, especially by that of the Lord of the
silver Mountains, animated thereto by the benediction and encouragement of
that arch-enemy of true Religion, the great Prince of ceremonies, and
Key-keeper of Idolana (a City sometimes very famous for worthy Heroes, and
glorious Martyrs, when virtue and verity were in most request, and now as
notorious for superstitious orders of ignorant and lazy votaries, as infamous
for allowed brothells, of lewd queanes and strumpets.) But of all the rabble
that attends upon their Demi-god Regicida, a ravening Wolf in a Sheep habit,
a subtle pated agent in politic affairs (that common State medlar, never
good till rotten) an Incendiary well known in Princes Courts, and most parts
of the habitable world, that have been hitherto discovered, one that is ever
casting firebrands of Treason, and sedition, wheresoever he comes, or is any
while admitted, though most times the sparks fly about his own ears, and
that whiles he is even ready to put fire to his powder-plots, and is at the
height of his Machinations, whose impudence is such, that the often and
manifest discovery of his treacherous designs, does no whit shame or
discourage him from the like attempts; Upon the first occasion, only intimate
your desires by some large gift, or proffer, and you have him with his
associates (whereof there are swarms in Verana, be the action never so
dangerous or unwarrantable) pressed and serviceable for the execution: and
therefore the Princes of Verana, especially the Monarchs of the blessed
Island, and Lilly fields, have little cause to favor his person, or to trust
to his flatteries.

But by what an ill subject am I carried, from the consideration of what I was
speaking, touching Aquilinus, who looks upon the distresses of Megala, with an
Eagles eye; to prey upon her liberties, and fasten her in the chain of a
perpetual slavery: And whereas that great Prince, who displayes the Queen of
Flowers in his Ensigns, casts an eye toward her at some distance, it is not
so much in compassion of her dejected estate, as of the rising greatness of
his ambitious competitour, who seeks by the ruin of all his Neighbors, to
set up a Throne for himself, and his house of absolute Empiry* over all the
Principalities in Verana, whiles others, which stand in opposition to his
designs, wish well to the disconsolate Princess, but having not power
answerable to their will, must, for their own ease and quiet, of necessity,
sit down as they may, and expect the event with patience.

But that the peerless Albania, of all others, should be so indulgent to her
self contentments, and be a looker on with dry eyes, and not take more to
heart the burning of a Neighbors house, allied to her by more than the ties of
ordinary relations, through a branch issued out of the same stock with her
Sovereign, but lamentably afflicted, through the wrack and loss of her
Rhenish darling, it seems wonderful, and that she is so senseless of the
wound that is given her through the sides of that Princess, and her Royal
offspring. And I fear it is too much her fault, herein common with other
Nations, whom long Peace and Prosperity has cast into a Lethargy of deep
security, to applaud their own happiness, and swelling there with to behold
foreign calamities, (as news not credible, or for a nine days wonder) with
the eyes of contempt and disgrace, nothing concerning their pity, or regard;
making an ill use thereof to justify themselves as more righteous, and
interessed in the favor of the Almighty (committing notwithstanding the same,
or like sins, of a worse nature and higher degree) upon no other ground but
that of Prescription, for the enjoyment of so much pleasure and plenty, so long
without abatement, or interruption, together with immunity and freedom from
the punishment their Neighbors have this while fallen into; whereas they might
with more reason, suspect and fear, and by woeful arguments conclude, that the
dregs of vengeance are reserved in the cup of the Divine justice (such a
sting has sin in it, and so bitter a potion does it compound) for these
wretches to suck out to the last drop, who make light of so gracious examples,
and are regardlesse of such unusual mercies and many warnings afforded to
them, so that there remains nothing but timely repentance, to bar the
draught, which though it relish as an unsavory pill to a dainty palate, yet
to the more confiderate, and such as are sensible of their estate and deserts,
I may not unfitly commend that of the Poet:

Sed and haec meminisse juvabit.
Often to mind on this,
Will not be much amiss.
Ah! careless, forgetful Albania: how is it possible, that a Nation as thine,
surrounded with an Ocean of all delights, and Crowned with a Cornu copia of the
greatest blessings, free from intestine mutinies, and foreign invasions
hitherto (notwithstanding these bold affronts enterprised with better
resolution then followed with success) should be thus unthankeful? Tell me,
can the Records of any people under the son, speak of such a continued
happiness as theirs, without some alteration? Call to mind, Albania, that
incomparable benefit from Heaven was conferred upon thy Land, in its
deliverance from the bondage and slavery of superstitious Idolana, whereby the
light of Gods true Worship has shined upon thee in such clearenesse, as the
Sun at noone day; and if therefore thy body were every day on the Altar of
thankesgiving consumed to ashes, it would be all too little for a gratulatory
sacrifice: for now

Cessant oracula Delphis.
All Pagan trumperies,
Are fled and fained lies.
The blessed Island may with much comfort say, There are no sacrifices in me
for gods, made, or created of mortal seed, such as proceed from the same
mould, live in the same clay, and return into the same dust, my people
attribute no protection of reasonable, or unreasonable creatures; Men, Nations,
Cities, Temples, to created substances; neither Jupiter, Apollo, Mars, Venus,
nor any of the male or female Planets, have any domination over our Worship:
whether Jupiter Hammon, or Jupiter of Creete, Mercury of Athens, Venus of
Paphos, Diana of Ephesus, be the Patrons and Patronesses of such places, comes
not within our Creed: whether Aesoulapius have the governance of Physicians,
Mars of Soldiers, Pan of Shepherds, Ceres of Husbandmen, or Lucina be the
women's goddess Midwife; as we abhor the names, so are we ignorant of the
persons: the Dryades, Hamadryades, Nereides have left our Springs: The
Sylvanes, Fawnes, and Satyrs have forsaken our Woods, ever since the vayled
sisters, and their cowled brethren were turned out of their cloisters: and we
have heard no tales of Elves, Hobgoblins, Fairies, and Robin-good fellows:
Albania is as free of Idolatrous Rites and Ceremonies, as she is of Bears,
Wolves, and other noisome creatures.

But (thanks be to the Almighty) we have the Worship of the only eternal
Deity, in Truth and Spirit, and soundness of Doctrine in the Fundamentalls,
concerning right belief and practice, consenting in a sweet harmony with the
other Churches of Verana, adorned with the decency of Discipline (instituted by
a pious Prince, and Council) according to the purity of the primitive
pattern, (as near as the times would permit) besides dignities, privileges,
and maintenance allotted to the Prelates, and other Ministers of the Sacred
Oracles (although perchance, not with that equal distribution, as admits not a
just complaint, and requires a due consideration for redress) to encourage
them in their studies, and diligences, according to their degrees and callings.
And if any abuse themselves in their demeanours, or duties, (for they are men,
and may err) the fault and penalty ought to reflect upon the persons, and not
the Function.

And farther had this Reformation extended, but that the death of that hopeful
young Prince ( Quo nulla aetas tulit meliorem; without disparagement to any be
it spoken) and therefore fitly paralleld with the good Josias, and by a
Zelotypian of subtle judgment, termed, The Mirror and prodigy of Princes;
hastened (as it is thought) by some treacherous practices, gave a period to
these expectations.

And although, after the decease of this Worthy, in the Reign of his elder
sister (a Lady of a temper mild enough by nature, had it not been wrested by
ill counsel: and a stock good enough to have borne better fruit, had it not
been ill grafted) there arose many black clouds in our Horizon, which
obscured the sky, and through the persuasion of ill advised heads, and her too
flexible yeeldings, dissolved in cataracts of blood, with such violence (the
flashes of Lightning which brake through, menacing to set Religion all on a
flame) that they seemed to bear down the groundwork of all former
proceedings before them: Yet ever blessed be the Omnipotent over-ruler, and
disposer of the greatest Potentates, and their purposes; This sanguis Martyrum,
proved to be but semen Ecclesiae, and the sparks that issued from the
bonefires, in which so many learned and holy men fried for the witnessing of
their Profession, flew into the eyes of their persecutors, and the shafts, they
thus madly darted at Heaven, and the stars, rebounded into their own bosoms
with a vengeance, whiles their Tyranny and lives ended shortly after, most of
them in a fearful and horrible manner.

And yet their incredulous abetters will not be so wise to take warning by such
evident examples, imputing Gods just Judgments, either to second causes, or
wrong ends; branding the relation with the credit of a Fable or Legend: as
hereby willing rather to lose themselves, then foregoe any antiquated error,
from the corruption of former times and ignorance to them conveyed.

But this mist being vanished, the Sun began to shine again, when the Scepter
and true Religion passed under the sway of Leonissa (incomparable Leonissa) a
Princess of an Heroicke spirit, and much differing in disposition and belief
from her sister, so that she might justly be termed, The Mirror of her sex,
and glory of her Kingdom; whose excellencies (says a worthy servant of hers,
without flattery) may well be admired, but cannot be related in any measure,
proportionable to the worth of their perfections. She was endowed with rare
gifts of Nature; and adorned with exquisite ornaments of Art; well skilled in
Languages, and in the Sciences; and could readily and pithily answer
Ambassadors and Orators in their several Dialects. As concerning her
behavior, she was affable, and loving, and therefore highly beloved of all her
good Subjects; she was feared, and envyed of her enemies, respected and
solicited by her Neighbors, whom, in their necessity, she diverse times
relieved, with Men, Moneys, and Munition: she was successful in all her
enterprises, victorious always in her attempts, either by sea or Land; and
safegarded from so many treasons and conspiracies against her person and
profession by the divine providence, that it seemed to work miracles in her
defense, and to point with the finger that she maintained his cause whom he
thus protected; and that as she subjected her actions to his glory, he inclined
her subjects to loyal obedience, and willing supplies; so that her Exchequer
was always well stored, and her people nothing grieved; for no new or
extraordinary taxes were imposed, but by the way of a general Assembly, that
was readily granted, which was reasonably required, and the giver was able
enough, and not the less willing to give again, when occasion required.

In this manner reigned this virtuous Empress, and lived to the years of an
aged Matron, but dyed a religious Virgin, and all good men shed tears at her
Exequies: Her loss was lamented of all, but such as were enemies to truth and
the Religion she professed, and yet maugre the thunderbolts and bug-beares of
Idolana, the malicious practices and endeavors of Gloriosa, the calumnies of
detracting Regicida, darted at her person, purposed against her Kingdom, and
leveld at her birth and actions, those braving censures of the one vanished
into the air, and (as a candle extinguished) left nothing behind them but a
stinking snuff. The invincible actions of the second were shamefully, and
(this was Gods own doing) totally defeated; but the virulency of the last
returned the cup of venom into his own hand, and caused him to drink his
bane therein, either wretchedly in other Countries, as a fugitive, or at home
desperately on the gallows, as a traitor, whilst a name remains to her of
happy memory, and will be in all ages as a precious ointment spread upon the
face of the whole earth.

Soloccubuit, nox nulla sequnta est.
The Sun was gone,
But night came none.
The Prince was changed, the happiness remained. For when the want of issue
seemed to put a mask on all faces, and to compass the Region of all hearts
with a doubtful trembling, and jealousy of the next succession; behold,
(without tumult or delay) a Lion Rampant of the Royal Stock, comes out of the
North, and steps into the Throne with general applause, and (to double the
content) brings along with him another Kingdom, like in complexion and
profession, to the hopes of a perpetual Union (May they never attain their
wishes which seek the discontinuance hereof, to the ruin of either!)

In this Princes person (being nursed at Helicon, and bred on Pernassus) the
Graces and Muses might well be said to meet together, or (if Platoes
Metempsychosis were admitted) that the soul of Palestina's Royal Prophet, and
harmonious Psalmographist had animated it he was a judicious Divine, persuasive
Orator, and ingenious Poet; very well skilled was he in the interpretation of
sacred Oracles, singularly dexterous in the resolution of doubts, and
determination of hard questions, and points of difficulty; powerfully able in
crushing the controversies, and untwisting the Gordian knots of Cardinal
Opposites; and that I feign nothing herein, or flatter in any sort, his
Treatises are sufficient Apologists, and witnesses: ( Let good Princes ever
have the honor of their deserts) He easily bore away the Palm from all other
of his rank, contemporary or of preceding ages. The truth is, he was not
addicted tam Marti, quam Mercurio, he made more use of his pen than of his
sword; neither can this any whit derogate from his commendation, or lessen the
worth of his Judgment.

Nulla salus bello, Pacem te poscimus omnes.
No safety is in War,
For Peace all suitors are.
None but such as are of a turbulent spirit, or ignorant what War is, love to
play the beasts and inhumanely gore each other, for to satisfy some carnal
appetite of ambition, Covetousness, or revenge; The Soldier indeed will fight
valiantly, only in a good cause, being necessitated thereto, either for Gods
glory, or the Kingdoms safety. Otherwise, if the undertaking respect some
private sensual end, the action can be no other then brutish and reasonlesse,
and here it is much better to purchase peace, though at a dear rate, then to
begin a quarrel, though with much advantage. The noblest victory is that which
is gotten without bloodshed; for the policy of the brain more than strength
of arm is requisite in an accomplished Captain, and best deserves the
Coronet: Men were not made to act Tragedies, nor to make the world a shambles
for humane slaughters, says a reverend man, and therefore that Worthy was well
advised, and his consideration merited high Commendation, who had rather save
one of his Subjects lives, then kill a thousand of his enemies: and that
Emperor was far from a bloody disposition, whose use was to hang out a
white, next a black, ere he was forced to put forth the red flagge: signifying
thereby that he was more desirous, and would use all means to save, rather
than destroy his enemy.

And with these or the like Precedents his late Majesty induced, bent all his
endeavors for the composure of those turmoyles and differences which unhappily
fell out betwixt the Princes (allies and confederates with him) in his time,
whose earnestness herein too much led him into the confidence of a strangers
soothings, and somewhat transported him (I confess) beyond his own
inclination, to be more severe in Justice against his own, then otherwise he
would have been: Which afterward (as some Objects are best discerned at a
farther distance) he well perceived with some regret, and much blamed the
foulness of their ingratitude, who abused his favors to the stain of his
other virtues: howsoever his aim was nevertheless praiseworthy, in framing a
silver Bridge for all enmities to pass over, whereby he purchased the blessed
Title of Peacemaker, and therewith in all quiet manner ended a happy reign and
life together.

From whose ashes is sprung the Phoenix, on whose beauty all the eyes of the
blessed Island are now cast, and for whose happiness, all the desires and
prayers of the virtuously minded, are daily sent to the Throne of Grace. A
Prince (not to conceal or palliate the Truth, where so manifest Authority
warrants) as for Temperance, Continence, Justice, Clemency, Bountifullnesse,
and such like virtues, amongst his equals claims the priority: and from his
Subjects the choysest of Obedience with all dutiful affections.

And now whiles under the wings of this unmatched Paragon, sits the glad
Albania secure from fear or danger, and at her leisure contemplates (as not
suspecting any change) on the manifold kinds of happiness, she formerly, and
now is wrapped in; and making a short progress through her Country, in conceit
to view the particular delights thereof, and withal including the Seas round
about, within the circumference of her thoughts; she seemed to see Neptune with
both his arms, hugging and embracing the blessed Island as the darling of his
delights, and on his Mantle of blew (as the favor of his Mistress) he wore a
chain of goodly ships, and such as no Sea within his vast and ample dominions,
could ever make show of the like, either for shape or use, a spectacle
(considering the workmanship and munition) full of pleasure and terror
together: amongst which one Sovereign, as Diana amongst her Nymphs,

Velut inter Stellas
Lima minores,
As to our sight by far
The Moon exceedes each Star,
gave such a luster of worth in her eminency above the rest* to the eye of the
judicious beholder, that she might be reputed well worthy of her name, and fit
to be servant only to her great Master, and not unbeseeming his especial
regard. On which rare object Albania would longer have staid her sight and
wonder, but that the Marine Commander with his Trident, was forcing sundry
sorts of fishes in scoales, to shorewards, where Triton summoned his
shell-subjects to join with them, and in numberless troops (the use nothing
diminishing the increase, oh the goodness of our merciful and bountiful
God!) to attend there for the relief of the inhabitants: and this caused her
to draw the eyes of her meditations thitherwards, and to magnify the Divine
Providence, which had for every season fitting, stored her Coasts with so
great abundance and variety of such delicate sustenance. And notwithstanding
the plenty, she wished the Fisherman (a very profitable member in any
Commonwealth, and one that if he use industry with art, deserves respect)
would not make such spoil of the young Fry, as is too commonly used.

Next, she considered the Harbors, which were many, secure, large, and
capacious; so that a Fleet of numerous ships might anchor in them, without
danger of any storm or damage, and sight each of other: although in some of
them Time began to play the Tyrant, and thrust bones into their mouths, so
that if a bountiful care did not quickly interpose it self for prevention,
they might (not without inconvenience to some prime Towns, and their Princes
profit) be altogether choked.

Into these Havens arrived daily from several parts of the world, Sails of
several molds and burdens, whereof some of the greater sort from the East,
unladed Silk, Spices, Drugs, Indicoes, etc. From the South, Wines, Sugar,
Oil, Fruit, Salt, Lyncloth, etc. From the North, Deals, Hemp, Flax, Furs,
Tallow, etc. None came empty into their Harbors, but (as Bees into their
Hives) with thighs full fraught of precious and delightful commodities,
whiles others were weighing Anchor to set forth with their fine clothes, so
much esteemed in all parts of the world; the Traffic whereof was so great in
the Low Countries, that the value of their Sale yearly at Antwerpe (if Jews
Guichardine misreckon not) amounted to more then four Millions, and the Wool
in his compute which was vented at the Staple in Burges, to 500000. Florens,
(where, by the way, may be easily conjectured how great the quantity of this
commodity is, by the many Families of Spinsters, Weavers, Fullers, that in most
Towns of the blessed Island are set on work for the making hereof; besides
others were fraughted with the purest Tin, Lead, etc. provision of fish
dried, pickled, etc. so that the ordinary Customs which accrued to the Crown
from these Merchandises (truly collected, and faithfully returned) were
Revenues of competency sufficient to maintain the State of more then a petty
Prince.

For the desence of the Havens, there were strong Castles and Bulwarks, raised
in the most advantageous places, for safeguard and offense. And peradventure
the charge would not be superfluous, and the work pay it self, if the Bays
and Creekes were awed by the like command, and that the Forts which in their
outsides presented such a warlike show to the beholder, were within surnished
with able and trusty Governors, with Soldiers and munition answerable,
encouraged by their due pay. And she did hope it was so, for her Eye could not
pierce through the walls to disceme the contrary.

Much taken with these objects of pleasure and delight, was the fortunate
Albania, and the eye of her contemplation could have so journed longer on them,
but that the wealthy, generous, and politic Merchants (the feet and hands of
the Commonwealth, for exporting and taking in of her several necessaries) who
were Owners of the Vessels, and maintainers of the Trade, drew her thoughts to
the place of their residence, which by reason of the former consequences she
conceited to be some glorious and well governed City; neither was she much
deceived in her imagination, which at her entry within the gates presented to
her sight, a large frame and Pile of stately building, no less pleasing in the
diversity, then in the uniformity of their structures; but she had almost lost
her self and forgot where she was, when she beheld the Royal Palace and Court
adorned with so many grave, wise, and loyal spirits (and indeed all that would
be Courtiers should be thus qualified) beautified with modest, native, and
Angelical faces (for Virtue and Beauty, commonly hand together) otherwise, the
fairest visages do but hide the foulest and most deformed souls; Loath was
our glad Lady to remove her gazing from these spectacles, but that the spiring
Temples built, and in reparation, showed a far off, as well the piety as
magnificence of the Prince who had such respect to the structures separated and
dedicated to the use of holy employments, not only in garnishing the walls
with commendable ornaments, but especially supplying the Deskes, and Pulpits
with learned and religious Ministers: (if it be otherwise any where, it is (I
presume) as far from his knowledge as his desire; and the more are those to
blame, that being set in authority for this end, abuse their trust, and are
negligent in a charge of so great importance, committed to them) whereby those
sacred Oratories, and Schools are upon all occasions thronged with the press
of all sorts of people that frequent them, to attend on the several devotions.

From the Church she went to the Senate, and there much rejoiced to behold the
Benches filled with a Prefect and Fraternity (she took them to be in heart as
show, and that the scarlet outside, was not lined with a sackecloth inside) of
a wealthy, Wise, and honorable Magistracy; and the fruits of their justice
did in some measure so bespeake them. Where she saw a Beadle carting a Whore,
and her Knave Baud, (pity the Goatish Whoremaster, by favor or means should
escape the search and punishment so narrowly) where she came by a Constable
stocking the Drunkard, and idle Runnagate. (good were it that all suspected
persons should give an account of their Living and employments, and so
perchance the hangman should not be so often employed to put a halter about the
neck of the Murderer, and Thief as he does: Long happy and peaceable may the
Reign of our gracious Sovereign be, who is so careful that his Land be not
defiled with blood, and that Justice has so free proceeding against capital
offenses!) And though this Kingdom, (a happiness to be wished, too great to
be enjoyed) cannot wholly be rid from lewd persons, and enormous offenders,
(there will be ever lazy droanes to lurk as long as there are busy Bees to
labor) yet the comfort is, there are good Laws enacted, to suppress the
common annoyances: and it is his Majesty's Will that they be put in execution.
I cannot stand to repeat the diversity of observations hereupon, wherewith
Albania stood possessed, nor how contented she was in viewing that Royal
Cittadell and Magazin of munition, and near thereto a goodly rank of
buildings, crossing a River, in which the salt water flows and ebbes more than
a days journey from the Main, whose banks were beset with a row of sumptuous
edifices and Gardens, with other like variety of pleasing objects, that,
wheresoever she directed her eye, took it up with wonder, and this admiration
increased the desire to see still farther, but fearing to surfeit with the
delicacies of this City happiness, she deemed it would be no small comfort and
recreation, to retire in her contemplation some while into the Country.

Where in her travail, ascending the Hills of an easy rising, she beheld the
soil (on both sides of her, transcendently fruitful) bespangled (if I may so
speak) as the Firmament with Stars, with Golden fleeces, of more value than
that the Argonauts of old adventured so boldly to bring from Colchos; and
therefore the Shepherd Swain is as famous as his Pastorals, and not unworthily
have Princes, Captains, and Priests, borrowed their resemblances, and he that
was far above the greatest of men, disdained not to style himself the true
Shepherd: but descending into the Vallyes, she pastalong Green Meadows, lying
by the Rivers, (each River having its store and variety of delicate Fishes) and
replenished with sundry sorts of Cattle for increase and use; and in the
Plains, hard by, she saw the Countryman tugging at the Plough, and thought it
no scorn to look on so mean a person, and work, or to visit his homely
Cottage, the one being so necessary for the being of the State, the other
stored with provision sufficient to welcome and entertain his guest, as well
as the Gentleman of other Countries. Neither did that lofty Poet of his time,
any whit descend beneath himself, or the dignity of his strain, or thought it
any abatement to his Muse, when he wrote that Poem of the Georgicke. But when
she beheld the Gentleman's place, considered his vast, and well contrived
buildings, with the pleasant Arbors, Walks, Ponds, Parkes, Woods, Lawnes,
Chases, that he was Master of, she could not imagine, but, where was such
abundance of all things, to content a worldly desire, there went store of
Hospitality with it. And indeed so it was in diebus illis, but I am sorry to
speak it, Pride and Gaming, two unfruitful bastards of ease and plenty, like
Mothwormes, have of late eaten much into this precious garment, for want of
timely circumspection in the greater part. But Albania, walking aside out of
the Common road, saw the wastes full of goodly timber Trees, but (to her no
little grief) withal saw much felling of the old, and little planting of new,
a neglect, which in time (if not prevented) might turn into a lamentable
inconvenience, but the plenty of what she saw for the present, quickly wiped
off the mistrust, or thought of any future misfortune. And now, though the
sweetness much abated from the length of the Walk, yet (as sometimes, when
we are glutted with pleasure, it breeds a loathing to be at so much ease)
Albania was by degrees tired in her pace; and had rested her self on the next
bank but that she was near by those famous Bathes, so curious for their
composure, so wholesome for the virtue of their waters, the Monument of Princely
Beneficence. In these she bathed her self once, and again, and was quickly
refreshed, so that having heard (and what ingenuous spirit has not heard?) of
those singnalr Academies, so much renowned for the seat, building,
maintenance, and learning, that was as it were appropriated to them, that she
thought, if she had neglected to take some view of them in this perambulation
of her mind, she might have been esteemed of little judgment, in taking so
much delight in things that reached to the outward senses, many whereof were of
use but to please the fancy only, and to have neglected, or undervalued the
Arts and Sciences whereby man was to be differenced from another Creature, and
one reasonable man from another, without which a Prince in his Throne, a
Captain in his Tent, a Governor on his Beach, were but as so many Statues fit
to fill a place, and of little other use: for he that has all the Wealth,
Honor, and Pleasure the World can afford, without the gifts of the mind in
some measure, cannot be said to live like a man; whereas, he that is endued
with knowledge, the more he retires into himself from all carnal respects,
soars the nearer to a Divine Nature, and is out of the reach of the common
miseries of care and fear, with which mere worldings, and ignorant persons
are so often overwhelmed: Upon those considerations she went, she saw, she
heard; but my Oratory is too weak to express the height of her admiration,
and it would require a Treatise, rather then a cursory Observation, to describe
the worth of the Scholar, and the pleasure of the Schools. But whiles here
she roved at pleasure in the Tower of her high Conceits, and reposed her
thoughts in the imagination of a like continual and interrupted happiness, a
deep sleep of security surprised her senses, whiles the fancy (still
laboring upon the former objects) presented in a strange dream, (and dreams
many times fall out too true) how vain and uncertain is the dependancy upon
worldly and temporary felicities; It seemed unto her, that in the midst of a
forward Spring season, in a fair Sunshine day, she was recreating her self in
a pleasant Grove, near the bubling stream of a Crystal Fountain, and saw
how all the banks and Borders thereabouts, were beset with goodly Trees of all
sorts; on the boughs whereof, diverse Birds according to their kinds, warbled
out sundry notes of melodious Harmony, and in the thickets, she saw the Dear
browzing on the tender leaves quietly, and how the ground was all mantled in
green, here and there bestrewed with flowers, white and red, that blushed to
see themselves (naked as they were) exposed to the eye of the beholder; so that
in this place there wanted nothing to content the outward senses, but that on a
sudden (to see the folly of such as spend their wits and time in building
earthly Tabernacles, and purchasing worldly inheritances) the bright Sun
became clouded all over, the Hemisphere darkened, the wind begins to blow, a
storm came on violently, the drops are powered down in abundance, so that the
clear streams grow muddy, the flowers hang down their heads, the Birds take
their flight, the Beasts resort to their shelter: And Albania (all affrighted
at this sudden change, starts, awakes, and looking into the Country round
about her, and considering how things went in those places, her eye had
formerly circuited, she found her fancy in this late vision, to be nothing
mis-enformed, but wondered to see the face of all things, as it were in the
turn of a hand, so strangely altered: for the Shepherd had driven away his
flocks out of the field, and put up his pipe, the Husbandman hadleft his
Plough, and was at a stand, whether he should Till his ground, and how he
should pay his Rent, the Gentleman gave over his sports, and looks after his
goods that were distrained, the Wife and Children cry out they are undone,
because the poor Labourer that should relieve them is wrongfully troubled, and
besides his wearisome travailes and expenses must be content to sustain the
wrong and damages at his own charges; the surety laments his own hard
fortune, and cruelty of the oppressing Usurer, whiles he is constrained to pay
the debt and interest, when the careless principal has wherewithal to
discharge it, and is untouched. One says he is unjustly punished for neglect
of a service whereof (as he ought to have) he had no notice, another exclaimes
against Officers, that they take too large and extraordinary Fees, and in the
mean time no offense committed, nor proved; the Tradesman blames the
Monopolist, for engrossing the sale of commodities for his own particular
advantage to the damage of the general; the Merchant accuses the Projector,
that unusual customs be imposed by his means; that so moneys be raised, it
matters not by what means; that the Princes name is used, and abused for a
color and cloak, and that the general assemblies, which were wont to be the
only means for supplying the Kings wants, and remedying the Countries
grievances, has been so often dissolved, that they did justly suspect that
the authors thereof were no small offenders and much they doubted that their
gracious Sovereign had not been rightly informed of their humble, hearty, and
loyal intentions toward him, the dignity of his Crown, safety of his person,
peace, and welfare of his Commonwealth. Many other complaints she heard, and
grieved to hear, what is not fit to be so publicly related; briefly, there
was murmuring in all sorts, discontent at all sides, and sadness in all
countenances, so that the amazed Albania upon view thereof was terribly taken
with a trembling in all parts of her, so that her members seemed dis-joynted,
and ready to fall asunder, the pain increasing toward her heart made her
look pale, and withal she became so faint, that, no longer able to support
her weak limbs, she fell down, and lay without motion, as one dead, or
entranced with some extreme passion, but long in this agony had she not
continued, when the two Ladies, Agape, and Sympathia came happily to her
relief, taking her into their arms, and carrying her into the next lodging,
they gently laid her on a bed; And now the report, for ill news has large
wings, being spread far abroad, Physicians, like vapors exhaled by the
sun, repair to her from all parts* Porters, Peasants, and Horse-groomes,
give their opinions; Markets, Innes, Tavernes, Barbers shops and Bake-houses,
have their council Tables; Women, and old Wives tell their tales, and
prescribe remedies: but of all the rest, there were three notable Impostors,
that took the cure on them, and that was Empericus a quackesalver, one that
stood much upon experience, and knew effects only, without consideration of
their causes, a man that was skilled more in the terms than the Art of his
Profession, and was of such a plaufible tongue, that by his flatteries he could
scrue, and insinuate himself into the affection of his Patient; his physic
consisted most in oils and plasters, that would draw a skin over the
grief, and make a fair show to the eye, whiles it festered inwardly, and grew
worse. The second was Chymicus, a Paracelsian, that had distilled the little
brain he had in his Lymbecke of folly together with his other metals, whiles
he built Castles in the air, and blowed away his own and other men's silver,
that he might be a beggar in purse and rich in conceit: His Recipes were all
compounded of new projects and inventions, and the drugges he gave were so
loathsome, and ineffectuall, that the sick were forced to vomit them up
again, and his Chrysoposis and Antidotes were like himself, of no virtue, and
worth nothing. The last was Philargyros, a covetous Mountebanke, whose love was
more to his Fee, then knowledge or care was for his Patient. This blood-sucker
was all in the drawing vein, so that with the Horse-leaches, and
Cupping-glasses, he applied to such parts as had more need of supply then
abatement, he so weakened the rest, that he put all in danger. Such were the
Physicians, and by them you might conceive more fear of harm, than hope of
remedy, and so it proved; for these fellows, after much ado to little
purpose, seeing by all symptoms that their medicines did work quite contrary
effects, not knowing what course next to take, give over, and leave the Patient
in worse case then they found her, and as they thought, desperately incurable;
for as yet Albania was without sense of her malady, or remembrance of their
cause: which the good old Chronos perceiving, and much pitying, as one that had
been a constant friend to her for many years, had seen much in his time, and
had overpassed many alterations in himself and others, posts away (for though
he was aged, he was not slow paced) to a solitary grove in a remote Land,
wherein was a cave so deep and obscure, that it was always night there, but
he that was wont to travail no less in the greatest darkness than at
midday, enters undauntedly, and returns with the fair Alitheia in his hand,
whom he brings to see the light, and she (naked though she was) is not ashamed
to be seen; to her he declares in what case he had left Albania, and the cause
of his coming. Alitheia soon conceived, what in truth before she feared, when
she last saw her, and therefore was much grieved at her departure so to leave
her, but seeing the least delay was very dangerous, expostulating no farther
with the old man about cirdumstances, she called to her an old servant of hers,
named Veridicus, whom (intending with all speed, according as she heard or saw
occasion, to follow after) she sent with Chronos, having given him sufficient
instructions what to do; Veridicus was (as his name spoke him) an honest
tell-troth, though plain, yet bold, and though forward, yet respectfull, and
he was so well skild in his Art, and so confident of his undertakings, that if
his prescriptions were carefully observed, he doubted not of such success as
might be justly expected; and in this hope his ability and charity pressing him
onward, he soon arrives with Chronos in a happy season, at the lodging where
the sick Lady was; Veridicus staid and knocked at the gate, Chronos past on,
(as his manner was) when forth comes Philauta a stately dame, and opens, but
casting her eye upon Veridicus, and seeing him in such homely array, judging of
the person by the attire, she disdainefully, without speaking a word, or asking
what he would, retires her self, and shut fast the gate after: but Veridicus
nothing dismayed with this affront well understanding from what subject it
proceeded, knockes again, and with more earnestness, (such are the times for
pooresuters) till that Novata, another of Albania's attendants, more desirous
of novelties, than fearful of her Mistresses disturbances, lets him in
without further question, and then understanding the cause of his coming,
whether for to satisfy her curiosity, or because her Mistress was forsaken of
all others, in this desperate estate she ushers him to her presence, who
presently without more complement or regard of the standers by, takes their
sick Lady by the hand, feels the pulse, which sometimes was very slow in
motion, and then presently as violent in agitation; he takes the Urinall,
viewes her state, finds it to be of a very high sanguine color, and much
troubled; he looks on her visage, beholds it wan and ghastly; he would have
asked her some questions, but she could not answer for want of the use of her
senses, besides that, her tongue was all black and swollen, the which and other
like symptoms, argued the patient to be in a dangerous distemper in all parts
of her body: And hereby he further perceived, that the two prime senses of
sight and hearing, were so ill affected in their isntrumental nerves, that all
objects seemed to exceed or lessen from their due proportion in quantity and
quality, so that discords were taken for unisons, and apparences, for ture
substances, and so on the contrary; and being in this manner presented to the
common sense, were likewise delivered over to the phantasy, which by reason of
diverse fumes, engendered in that cell of the brain, caused the like error in
the judgment and memory, and by reason of the ill affection of these superior
intelligible faculties, he found the inferior, and more sensitive parts to
partak and be oppressed with their particular maladies, as the heart to be much
passionated with the dissimulations and waverings of Liliana, the Lungs to be
obstructed, and breath faintly through the hot and biting distillations of
Idolana, the stomach to be overcharged with the gluttony and surfettings of
Aquilina, the belly tympanized with the windy vapors of Gloriosa, the Loins
impostumatized with the inflammations of lustful Zelotypia, the hands
blistered with the itchings of Argyria, her legs and feet lamed and swollen
with the gout of Argoa, into which loathsome estate she was not so much fallen
by means of native constitution or complexion, but through infection of the
humors, by the corruption of the times, imitation, and too familiar converse
with her Neighbors, the negligence and ignorance of covetous attendants, ill
Counselors, and unskilful Physicians: so that Veridicus considering her
deplorable estate, much grieved thereat, and could not but abruptly in some
short and passionate expostulation, thus express it. Oh Albania! distressed
and pitiful Albania, and the more (said he) to be pittyed in thy distress,
because Albania! There is no time now to think on Megala, thy own misery is
too much to think upon, happy had thou been, if thou could sooner have
thought thy self unhappy; had thou been sensible of thy inward corrasives,
as thou were overjoyed with thy outward felicities, thy sore had not thus
grown to an ulcer, nor the prick brought thee in danger of the Gangrene; thy
too much overweening in prosperity, has humbled thee to this grievous
adversity, thy too much magnifying thy own power, and excellencies above thy
Neighhours, has now dejected thee to their contempt, and conspiracies; thy
exalting thy self in comparison of all others, has almost made thee unworthy
the comparision for any. But I will not add reproach to misery. The occasion
and cause require rather help to draw thee out of the danger thou art
unworthily brought into, then enquiry by what means thou were brought into the
danger: Both since the time is short, and the disease sharp, the cure must be
as quick, and the medicine of the greater virtue and operation, which the more
it smarts, the sooner will heal. Have but the patience to endure, you shall
the sooner find ease, and but pardon the rudeness of the Physician, and let
me not be mistaken in the sincerity of my endeavors, you shall soon perceive,
that in the least flattery is most friendship, and although a sweet bit does
best please a curious pallat, yet that a bitter pill is more profitable, and
that plain dealing has no fellow.

Having thus said, he again took her by the hand, and bid her be of good
cheer, but perceiving that she was insensible of what he spoke or did, he saw
it was high time from the apparent cause, to bethink himself of the
convenient cure; and that first of all it was necessary to use the next means
for restoring her to the use of her senses, that she might come to some feeling
of that deplorable estate she was then in. To which purpose he spouts into her
nostrils that precious water Mnemosyne, with which the obstacles of her memory
were soon cleared, and the passages of her ears unstopped, so that she might
truly distinguish the sounds which she heard; and to her eyes he applied a
Gnosticke Collyrium, by virtue whereof all mists vanished from her sight, so
that she could plainly discern objects presented to them, as they were
indeed, and not as they seemed to be: Then in a potion (as well as he could) he
gave her a Cordial of sincerity for the heart, a cleaning Electuary of
integrity for the Lungs, a diet drink of temperance for the Stomach, a purge
of humble dejections for the belly, a cooling ointment of continence for the
Loins, a pleasing salve of contentment for the hands, and a quicke-working
plaster of Action for the Legs and Feet; and so to each other Malady, he
proportioned a proper medicine: and now that he might further know her mind by
her speech, with a sovereign water, which Alitheia, had given him, and he knew
to be effectual for that purpose, he washed her tongue, and presently she
perceiving, that hereby she recovered free ability of speech, neglecting to
take notice of any that stood about her, in a most pitiful manner, casting her
eyes toward Heaven (a hopeful sign of a perfect recovery to ensue) often
lifting up her hands, and then presently with them smiting her breast, she
signified in the one, the heartinesse of her gratulatory and manifested her
true Repentance, and the sorrowful compunctions of her heart; by the other
whiles sighing, and all the whiles bitterly sobbing (the tears trickling down
her cheeks in great abundance) the first words she spoke were, O Ens Entium
miserere mei! and then turning to Veridicus in all kind and thankful manner,
acknowledged the benefit she had received from him, and promised a future
mindfullnesse, and she requested him upon his former care, not yet to leave her
in that case, for fear of a relapse, and for what course was farther to be
used for perfecting of the cure, she relied upon his care, and would be ruled
by his advise: she bemoaned her great ingratitude toward her Omnipotent
Benefactor, and preserver, whom for his many and extraordinary blessings, she
had requited with multitude of deep unkindnessrs and transgressions: she
bewailed her overgreat neglect of the forlorn Megala, and overmuch credit,
and respect of her cruel and treacherous enemy, foreign and domesticke, and
therefore judged her self worthily rewarded, in seeing the distractions of her
own Country; But whiles she was thus bemoaning her many calamities, the noise
of drums and trumpets that sounded over all the Country, came to her ears
whereby she was stricken with a new terror of fearing some danger toward, by
reason of the precedent evils; but upon demanding the cause, when news was
brought her, that her sister Vnita was proclaimed a rebel, she could not
forbear to cry out, wringing her hands, tearing her hair with other like
extreme passion of dolor, and impatience, till that the prudent Viridicus was
constrained to use force with entreaties to bring her to reason, and he could
not but sharply reprove her weakness, that she would play the Child, and be
so afraid of others harm, whiles she was not yet cured of her own, and that
it was above his Art to effect what only lay in the power and will of her
Prince to do: and therefore he must be sued unto, or else what he could advise
would be to small effect, only his endeavor should never be wanting, and what
wanted of power in him to this effect, should be supplied with the greater
willingness.

Now the truth is, that Vnita upon the report of Albaniaes sickness and her
own discontents, under color of a visit contrary to the will and command of
her Sovereign (as was supposed) had with troops of her Countrymen, marched
beyond her limits, and made way by force of Arms, into the territories of her
Neighbors, and committed Acts which in their first appearance savoured of some
disobedience, and gave suspicion of ill intents, not only toward Albania, but
to the Sovereign of both Kingdoms; and although their promises and
protestations pretend the contrary, and argue mainely for the justness of such
an entry, and though (to speak charitably) we believe their minds to accord
with their words, I cannot see how actions of this nature can be justifyable,
except you will allow extraordinary effects, to extraordinary occasions; In
consideration whereof Albania was so dismayed with her sisters presumption and
oversight in offending her Lord and Master, laying her self open to manifest
contempt, and hazarding the safety of her King and Religion (as she then
supposed by this indiscreet attempt) and hereupon, but more especially in
regard of her own estate, she entreated Veridicus (as he had before advised)
that he would speedily supplicate her gracious Sovereign, in her behalf, to
give way that such course might be speedily taken for the redress of the evils
happened to her, and her sister Vnita; as had been always successefully used by
his Majesty's predecessors, for the preventing and abolishing like mischiefs:
for otherwise there would be small hopes of her absolute recovery, and if she
did miscarry, his Majesty could not promise himself secure safety, upon any
ground that did yet appear.

Veridicus, as well to content the disconsolate Lady, as to discharge his own
duty, which bound him to expose himself to any travail or danger for the
service of his Prince and Country, takes the charge upon him, and without
delay, weighing the danger of relapse in Albania, and mistrusting the purposes
of discontented Vnita, prepares for the Court, from which, pity it is, he had
been so long absent.

But at his departure he wishes Albania to dismiss some of her old
attendants, and commended unto her two of her Ladies kinswomen, Agatha and
Fidelia, to be near unto her, and of her Council, for they had been brought
up from their Infancy with Aletheia, and had learned of her how to speak and
behave themselves, and so carrying themselves according to her instructions,
all things have happily succeeded, which have been committed to their trust
and managing. Farther he wished her to be very wary and circumspect with whom
she did treat, or participate her affairs, not to give the least bearing to
any speech that relished of flattery or vain delight, nor fix her eyes
steadily for any time upon the fairest* carnal objects the world could afford,
nor give countenance to the project of any insinuating Sycophant (under the
pretense of private gain) against the common good; never to murmr at her
Sovereigns Prerogative, nor to question his just commands, nor be unwilling to
pay his lawful impositions; not to utter any thing passionately against his
Officers, or their Commission, but leave them to their competent Judges; and
evermore to be frequent in her Orisons to the supreme governor of all
Creatures, that he would turn all to the best, and so direct the heart of her
Prince, that he would yield a gracious ear, and set a period to all her
troubles: and for her own ease, he wished her to fast often, and when she was
forced by the necessity of nature, to take some repast, she should be sparing
in her delicates, and eat not to the glutting of her appetite, so that these
ill humors, which otherwise would abound, and issued from diverse parts of her
body, might be abated, and the whole better prepared for convenient physic,
to the recovery of her former health, without dismembring any part of the same,
if possibly it might be* and so he left her expecting the Ladies, whom he had
appointed to wait on her.

Veridicus was at the point to be gone, but bethinking himself that the
access to the King for so plain and blunt a fellow as he was, (in a time of
such employment and affairs of so high consequence, whereabouts the most
Honorable and wisest heads of the Kingdom were assembled, to consult and
determine; and that he should come with a tale already told) would not be
easily granted, nor was it fit yet, considering his promise, and that his
Sovereign would not disdain to receive a petition from the meanest Subject,
presented in the way of due respect and loyalty, though he proceeded not in the
journey, he presumed to take pen and write his mind, in a few petitionary
lines; and that they might be as graciously accepted, as they were dutifully
endyted, he directed them to his sacred Majesty, by the hands of two virtuous
and honorable Messengers, Sophia and Sophrosyna, to this effect.

Most high and mighty Prince, as the eternal Majesty does not disdain to cast
down an eye of favor upon the humble supplication of the Royal Potentates on
Earth: so Princes that take this supreme Lord for their pattern, sometimes
think it no disparagement, to reach out a gracious hand, and receive a
petition from their meanest Subject. It is true, that your Majesty is a Prince,
for eminency in graces and honor, far above others of this high calling, and
I am your Subject of the lower rank, called Veridicus, that love to speak the
Truth: I have had my breeding in the Country, my speech is as my self, plain,
and rude, without Rhetoric or other Art. And therefore it may be judged too
great presumption, for a person of so mean degree and parts, to come so near
as the Chamber of such Royal presence; but knowing your Highness to be good,
as well as great, and having heard that your Majesty, out of the gracious
temper of your mild and virtuous disposition, and inclination toward the
content and welfare of all your loyal Subjects, of what degree soever, have
granted free access and audience to their just and reasonable requests, it
has em boldned me (though the meanest) amongst other (none being so bold as
the blind Bayard) to address the desires of your subject and Handmaid the
dejected Albania, to your Princely consideration, hoping that the uprightness
of mind shall excuse the rudeness of the delivery, and that the honesty of the
matter shall beg pardon for the messenger, and where duty is intended, no
misconstruction shall have place, whiles I strive to be brief, that I be not
offensive.

It is not unknown to your sacred Majesty (ill fame has a swift pace) how
that Albania of late has been surprised with so strange and unusual
maladies, that her best Doctors are almost at their wits end, and know not what
to make of the cause or cure, except your Majesty give leave that the free
practice of the skillfull, according to the pattern of former times, be
speedily put in execution, for searching into the root, and drawing forth the
ill humors, that have been the means, and are the maintenance of her
distempered estate.

But Albania, your poor distressed supplicant, is not so much cast down with
the consideration of her present misery, as with the grief she conceives of
your Highness displeasure toward her, for the neglect of duty and ill
services, whereof she knowing her self as guiltless in her endeavors, and
desires, as her accusers are malicious, and groundless in their purposes,
humbly beseeches that she be not condemned before she be heard, and that her
cause may be freely pleaded before your Majesty, in that high Court of the
general Assembly, and discussed in all points fully to the end, without her
adversaries interruption or disturbance.

No Subjects of any Prince (I speak confidently, what I know to be true) ever
more heartily loved their Sovereign, or more desired his Honor and safety,
than Yours: Witness how glad, when there was but mention of a Parliament,
wherein they might show some real expressions of their willingness; then how
cast down were they, when it was so suddenly dissolved, and they mistaken; but
since it has pleased your gracious Majesty, out of your wisdom, and innate
clemency, according to the example of your most Worthy Predecessors, willingly
to give a happy beginning, and loving promises of a fair continuance to
another Assembly, upon the earnest request of your Worthy Nobles, and the
general desire of your true hearted Commons, both for the remedying of all
former misconceites, and prevention of future discontents, and inconveniences,
with what an unanimous acclamation of joy, vows, wishes, has it been
received? The Almighty grant, that no factious or ill-minded spirit to the
general good, may stop or break off the lawful proceedings therein.

And now, as formerly, the hope and desire of all true hearts is, that the
Truth of Religion may be supported, and maintained, and whatsoever makes not
with it, or is against it, (how precious soever it be in show) may be taken
away; Your Majesty has piously given your word already, and shewby your daily
practice, how your affection stands inclined, and it is nothing doubted of your
part, of a firm continuance, but because no good thing can be made too sure,
and for the benefit of succeeding times, it may not be impertinent to confirm
it by some new Act, in such manner as by this Honorable Assembly, with your
Majesty's approbation, shall be thought to sort most with the glory of God, and
the purity of the primitive institutions; next to the honor of God, and
removing of the present grievances, a confirmation of the just Laws and
Liberties of the Kingdom is desired, and in this request, that the welfare and
Honor of your Majesty is included, may be easily proved, as also that those of
your Subjects, which stand up so stoutly for their laws and liberties (so
warrantable as they are) are not the worst welwillers to the dignity of the
Crown, whiles they seek not so much their own advantages herein, as those
which are contrary minded are found to do, but declare themselves impartial
in their designs, and that as fast and faithful vassalles, not to be carried
with the change of time or fortunes, as ill counselors, whose projects, though
at the first sight seem to promise much, yet in the issue do fail commonly.
I suppose your Majesty would not desire to be King of such a base and
slavish-minded people, as were careless observers, or wilful neglecters of
those just Ordinances and Privileges, under which the Kingdom has been so
long time happy and prosperous: for as those Princes are accounted Tyrants,
that rule only by compulsion of the Subjects against the Laws, so may those
Subjects be esteemed no better than Asses that bear any burden is laid upon
their backs, it is much to be suspected, that such as love innovations, and
attempt change of government, may by the same reason be drawn in time to
dislike of the Governors themselves. When we are in a good and sure way, it is
safe keeping in it, for those by-pathes which we conceive to be nearer, are
hard to find, and more dangerous; and the policy is neither commendable nor
profitable, to learn the hurt of ill counsel by experience. Now the way to
maintain the Kings Prerogative, (the greatest Prerogative of a King, is the
preserving of his Justice) and to keep on foot the Liberties of his Subjects,
is by that general Council (as now by your Majesty's gracious favor happily
met together) of the whole Land presented in some particulars for that end, and
that this has been the readiest way of providing convenient supplies for the
Princes occasions, and necessities, for redressing the Countries grievances,
and punishments of capital Offenders; neither can there be any other means
devised, whereby to levy greater sums of money for the Kings use more
speedily, or with like chearefullnesse, and in such manner, that no person
shall have just cause to complain, or be so impoverished, but upon another
occasion shall be able and willing to give again, whereas (whatsoever others
project or persuade to the contrary) taxes and impositions enforced on the
Subject in an extraordinary manner, and way, are (experience too well shows
it) unwillingly, and but in part, with a great deal of murmur and grudging
from those which are least able to bear extorted. For there is not the least
Worm, but being trodden upon will turn tail, though he may not, nor dare
make resistance; and every man in a common tumult will seek to shift his
Collar, and the weaker must of necessity go to the Wall, and men (when they
are driven to extremities) will be swayed more by passion then reason, and
there is hard reclaming of affection by force, when it is once alienated.
Whereupon the common enemy taking, or making occasions, will cast in his hook,
and fish in those troubled waters: all which this general Assembly may happily
prevent, whereby the heart of the Prince and peopleunited in the adamantine
linkes of reciprocal affection, things hereafter will go on in so fair and
loving manner, that each part shall hold it self well satisfied, and no privy
traitor, or open adversary whatsoever dare to practice against such combined
forces. And this, most excellent Prince, is the main end that draws all true
hearts upon their knees, to beg of your Highness, that as you have honored
this Assembly of your subjects with a happy beginning, and profer of much
favor, by the encouragement of your gracious presence, and promises; so you
would be pleased (notwithstanding the importunities of any opposition) to give
it the rights appertaining to the same, and suffer it to have such a peaceable
progress, that your subject may be able to express the true intention of his
desire, and manifest the sincere affection of his heart, in willingly
performing what shall most stand with your Majesty's Honor, and safety of the
Kingdom.

But if under the pretext of loyalty (which cannot be imagined in hearts of
such unstained Religion) there were harbored in any of this Assembly a desire
to bring innovations into Church or Commonwealth, if they did seek to derogate
any thing from your Majesty's honor, or just prerogative, to advance their
own liberties by exemptions from their ancient dues, or to bring in, or allow
of any other kind of government, and authority, Civil, or Ecclesiastical,
that might counterchecke, or diminish from the Royal dignity of the Crown; if
they did seek to monopolize any commodity for their particular advantage, had
any project that did aim at any private end, and not concur with the good of
the general State; if their grievances were fained, or pretended, which they
could not manifestly prove, or were not too sensible of, could they pitch upon
any other course or way, whereby your Majesty's desires might be satisfied,
wants supplied, and their grievances eased, neither the sorrowful Albania,
true meaning Veridicus, or any other subject, that had the least spark of
reason, or were well in his wits, would at this time insist in any needless,
and unjust petition, to so Gracious Majesty, and rejoice to have induced the
means of his Countries misery, together with the certain ruin of himself,
and his posterity.

But when is shall be proved to be otherwise, how much are they in blame, and
what enemies to the State (I would sad experience did not witness it) which
imputing the fault where is none, have been the hinderance of the proceedings,
and causes of the late dissolutions of this Assembly, whereby their actions
might not be brought in question (a child may tumble a stone into a well, which
a multitude of strong men shall hardly be able to draw out) and thereupon the
opportunities of preventing the dangers, and expenses, which have since
followed, have been omitted with other inconveniences, so fast coming on,
that your Majesty is, as it were, now enforced upon this course, in much
strictness of time, and turbulencie of business, that the wisest under
standings tremble to think what will be the issue, if this assembly have no
better success than formerly: In the mean while, if such mean well as are
suspected of this notorious injury done to their King and State (I can accuse
none; but sure there cannot be smoke without fire) me thinks they of all
other should desire the trial of a Parliament, that so they may be cleared
from these foul aspersions, and their innocence manifested by a more general
vote, and their accusers censured; and upon this ground was that worthy
resolution of Leonissa observable, that if any man complained unjustly against
a Magistrate, it were reason he should be severely punished; if justly, she was
Queen of the small, as well as of the great: and hereby also shall the true
authors be the sooner discouraged; and for example, receive their condign
punishment, who although in way of excuse, may pretend your Highness allowance
for their doings, yet while they principally sought the accomplishment of their
own designs, with the dishonor of their Prince, and those (it is a mixime in
Policy) that respect not their Princes honor, cannot be well said to love his
person, their actions can no way be justifiable, since those favorites that
turn Apostates to due obedience, and abuse a favor afforded to them, to the
injury of the Giver, do too much undervalue their Prince, and are of all
ungrateful persons the worst, and deserve the highest of punishments. And by
the discovery of these offenders your Majesty shall reap a double benefit.
First, a freedom from ill counsel, and practices, with the gain of sounder
hearts and advises. Secondly, a reunion of your subjects hearts and affections:
to which for your Majesty's safety, the devises of all the Projectors in the
world are nothing comparable; and in this regard the desire of a learned, and
valiant Prince in his time was no less truly royal, than memorable, in that
he had rather be master of his subjects hearts, than their goods; and Lord of
their affections, rather than a Conqueror of his enemies dominions: and
besides this, your Majesty shall assure all doubting spirits, that you are more
led in your resolutions by judgment than passion: and that you can make use of
ill instruments no farther than to work out good effects by them: that your
favor is swayed according to desert, that your deeds shall be effectual, as
your promise has been gracious, and hereby their gross stupidity, to the
dispiriting, and terror of other like as thought to manage all the affairs of
the State with such an high, and absolute hand, and in the mean time to dance
in a net, undescryed, unpunished, shall more plainly appear, and the
difference will be made evident betwixt such as counsel for their own ends,
and relations, and others that do it merely out of duty, without other
respects. Now what farther benefit will accrue to the Kingdom by demonstration
of your Majesty's regard to the love and desires of your peoples request, and
how your Highness prerogative can be no ways abridged, your Exchequer more
plentifully furnished, your honorable intentions according to your own
expectation accomplished, your friends and well-wishers comforted, your
enemies, domestique, and foreign discouraged, time will shortly bring to light
with most infallible evidences.

But I fear in so far pressing my message, I have forgot to whom I speak,
and the person I was to represent, the distress of Albania (dread Sovereign)
has caused this excess of speech, wherein if I have been impertinent in any
extravagances, or too tedious with needless tautologies, I hope your Majesty
will graciously pardon these errors of love and duty, and your humble vassal
shall ever pray for the prosperity of your long and peaceable Reign on earth,
the enjoyment and felicity of an endless Reign in Heaven: both which he that
is only able, the Lord Almighty, for his Sons sake grant unto you for his
Glory, the Churches good, and your Majesty's eternal comfort.

Veridieus having in this free manner delivered the desires of Albania to her
Sovereign, thought she would not be satisfied, except her sister Vnita, were
somewhat expostulated with by him, concerning her arrival at this time, and in
such manner: but understanding her desire was not to treat with, or deliver the
intentions of her mind to any but the general assembly, he saw his labor
would be needless; yet howsoever, whiles he had pen and paper at hand, he
wrote to her, and her associates briefly and plainly to this effect.

Unconquered Vnita, and ye my brethren of the North (for so I may now presume
to call you) what a joy to all true hearts is it to find, that the report of
sinister affections toward the common good is found a lier; and that your
intentions are hit herto justified by your loyalty, and fidelity toward the
safety of your Prince, and the welfare of both Kingdoms? the enemies whereof,
as they have showed their selves malicious, so much more treacherous in their
designs, than they could with all their inventions impute to others by any of
their forged calumniations. Good Lord! what a plot of mischief had they
hammered out upon the anvill of their subtle devises to make us to
misunderstand, and misconstrue each others words and actions? so that if the
never failing mercy of God had not in the very moment of danger interposed it
selse to the preventing of what was intended, we had barbarously sheathed our
swords in each others bosoms, and bathed them in the blood of our nearest
friends, to the unspeakeable grief of Verana, and long expected joy of Idolana.

Alas it was far from the thought of Albania, ever to conceive that her
sister Vnita would presume to come near the presence of her Sovereign with a
petition in one hand, and a sword in the other, without the extreme necessity
of his Majesty, and his Kingdoms good enforcing it: neither could she believe
that Vnita sought to have the person of their joint Liege under her absolute
power, that his word might be wholly at her command: neither could she endure
to hear with patience, that she would prove so unjust, as to covet some place
of abode for her greater ease in her sisters possessions: but she is yet
confident, and always has been of the mind, that whereas she has surprised
Towns and Castles, fortified them with strong defenses, it is more for the
security of her retreat in safety, than for any enjoyment after her just
desires are satisfied: neither can Albania any ways blame her demand of
reparations for the wrongs and injuries she has sustained, against those that
have been the maine cause thereof, as being now discovered to be the sole
incentives of all the troubles in Church and Commonwealth, that have unhappily
of late, fallen out to the disturbance of the blessed Island in both Kingdoms;
How feign would they have caused the abused parties to fasten upon this
belief, that Vnita by taking up arms, and coming in this warlike manner
(since by their cruel plots there was no other way left open for admittance)
had manifested an open rebellion against her Prince? whiles the event has
hitherto published, that her prime accusers have been the great offenders, by
whose wicked contrivances, both Albania and Vnita were for a time hoodwinked;
and by a way, which they least suspected or dreamed, alike endangered to have
fallen headlong into an inevitable ruin of life, estate, religion, and all
together.

A cunning devil, thus to turn Angel of light, and under the color of
religion and justice, politiquely to undermine the state of the Church, and the
liberty of the subject, by its own means, and instruments, to betray the
Court with insinuations of new projects, to defile the Temple with
superstitious ceremonies, and the pulpit with new doctrines, and strange
opinions, to breed jealousies betwixt a most loving Prince, and his loyal
people, by breach of Parliaments, and perverting of justice: and having thus
put all things into a general confusion (like the fish Sepia that blackes the
water to blind the fisherman) to think to escape undiscerned, unavoided: But
thanks to the Almighty, through his providence the net is broken, and we are
delivered; it is through his great mercy, and not our foresight, that the
common enemy (who stood waiting when the mine for our destruction would be
fired, that he might have blown the coals to maintain the flames of a
misconceived division) cannot yet by any secret or open stratagem of his, take
advantage to do that harm he would, and has long wished.

Had the imagination of these wrongs to Albania been grounded upon mere
suspicions, and no certain evidences, and lamentable experiences: or had there
been cause to mistrust so much injustice and ambition in Vnita, under the
pretext of right, to promote some private ends, could any man be so partial in
his judgment, or senseless to think that the one would have taken up such
bitter complaints, or the other thought to have wrought out her purposes by
force of arms, and open violence against her sister (besides her other
strength) assisted with a right cause, and so powerful a Sovereign; and
suppose she might contest so far with her in an unjust way, as to gain a
victory or two upon great advantages, (the divine jnstice for our sins
permitting her to take such a foil) yet Vnita could not be so ignorant in the
mean while, as not to conceive her own extreme danger in one overthrow, which
in this cause were most likely to fall out, and that in the upshot it had been
far better (it was well thought upon by an experienced Captain of his time)
never to have fought, than thus to overcome; when besides the rebelling against
her Sovereign, the wronging her dearest friends, to the infamy of her name,
there must needs have followed the overthrow of her estate, life, and liberty,
with an exposing of her posterity, friends, and religion it self, to the mercy
of the common adversary, with the general damage to all the reformed Churches
in Verana.

And therefore truly they must be very malicious, and traitorously minded, that
would go about to persuade, and Albania should be very simple to be persuaded
of any such intents, or purposes of her sister thus toward her, who had she
professed her self an enemy, had offered injuries and affronts beyond
sufferance (God forbid our sins should by any enemies practices come to that
height, or that neighbors, speakers of one language, subjects of one
Sovereign, and professors of the same true religion, should so much forget
themselves) yet it cannot enter into my thoughts, that Vnita would presently
thrust herself into such a course of revenge, as thereby to bring her Country
to utter desolation, and poverty, and subjugate her neck and liberties under
the command of any foreign, or Idolatrous tyranny.

But why mention I such impossibilities? O blind spirited Idolanist, and
Machiavilian politic, that loves ever to be making of troubled waters, and
fishing in them, what old fetches are these of thine, out of the treasury of
thy Regicidian Fathers, and Counselors, to raise jealousies, break amities,
if ^^ might be, betwixt all relations, smother truths, palliate falsehoods, to
bring thy pernicious designs to those effects (how prejudicial soever) for
which they were intended; but yet most foolish, unadvised, and desperate
wretch, not to understand and learn, (by so many examples of the strange
discovery, and just punishment of treacherous intendments against Princes and
Religion in all ages) the certain misery and woeful ruin thou throwest thy
self into, whiles God looks on these thy actions with an eye of revenging
justice, the Angels with disdain, the devil with laughter, and all good men
with just indignation! Go on thus to merit, thus to supererogate; A traitors
reward, will be always a traitors concomitant; like offenses will require like
punishments. I could never yet read, or hear of any traitors, but have been
recompensed with hatred by their chief abetters: some Princes may be so unjust
as to love the treason which makes for their ends, but none have been so bad,
either long to trust or love the traitors: and what reason have they to esteem
such brutish and base spirited minds, as to attain a little transitory honor
or pelf, will venture their souls, life, wit, understanding, goods, and what
else they have, or hold dear, to betray their Prince and Country, unto the
cruelty of their ancient, and bloody minded enemy? O how much is every loyal
heart distasted with the thought of such a mischievous brood amongst a people
of so much civility, religion and unstained nobility? Let Vnita pardon and
bear with this passion to which my love and zeal for her welfare has so
far transported me.

And (to conclude) my hope is that I am not deceived of her well-like wishings,
and real intentions of good toward Albania, for the strengthening of their
joint forces against the common enemy, and inseparable uniting of their hearts
in a mutual affection betwixt themselves with a respectfull duty toward God,
and their Prince, in the purest manner of worship toward the one, and duest
kind of obedience toward the other: and therefore my desire is, that both
parties should hereafter meet rather to embrace than to stand in arms, much
less to fight each against other; but jointly set upon their Sovereign with
the weapons of prayers and tears; but upon his enemies, and the enemies of his
allies with the sword and musket; and in the mean time to be importunate with
the Almighty, so to direct the heart of the King, and bless the proceedings of
the Parliaments in both Kingdoms, that all discontents, and grievances on each
side be removed, God glorified, the King satisfied, the good Subject pleased,
and the bad punished, his enemies with those of the sword and musket: and our
joint desire and expectation henceforth shall rest in this, that God will so
direct the heart of the King, and bless the proceedings of this
Honourable*Assembly, that all discontents, and grievances on each side, shall
be happily removed, and a time shortly follow for the manifest discovery, and
just punishment of such as have been the disturbers of the peace, and quiet of
both the Kingdoms; and the Almighty preserve us in this mind without faltring
or dissimulation to promote those actions only which may tend to the
maintenance, and increase of his Glory, in all our counsels and enterprises.

By this time Veridicus imagining he had in some part discharged the office of
a well-wisher, and impartial friend to Vnita, and her well minded Countrymen
(howsoever by some malevolent spirits, it might be slighted, or not well
accepted) sealed his letter, and sent it away, by an old servant of his, named
Plerophoros. And hereupon returning to see how it went with his languishing
patient, and to acquaint her with what he had done; in the way it was his
chance to meet with Calopolites, an old acquaintance of his, and one that was
chosen to be of the number of the general Council that was newly assembled in
the behalf of Albania, and some necessary occurrences that much concerned her,
and her sister Vnita, and therefore was so well imformed how the case stood
betwixt them, that Veridicus needed not to make any new relation: to whom
(though he were in some have by reason of the weight and multitude of
business that did require presence) the plain old man imparted, what came
into his his mind for the present, though briefly, yet with tokens of some
zealous earnestness.

O Calopolites, I know you to be understanding, and honest, (as your name
imports) and that these two virtues are very requisite for the charge you have
undertaken, whereby you need not be instructed in what concerns your duty
therein: yet give me leave to express what is expected of your friends, and
acquaintance, that you would be especially mindful of what shall tend to the
benefit of the Church, and the Glory of God, first by carefully heeding to the
secret plots, and underminings of Idolana, for the excrease of Superstition,
and Idolatry: secondly, by timely suppressing that Luciferian pride of such new
Dogmatilts, as would intrude themselves into the Eternal throne, and dispute
of the extent, and manner of the divine secrets by Election and Reprobation;
and question the equity of Gods Justice in its proceedings according to humane
reason, by loving one and hating another before either good or evil was
committed by either of them; and murmr secretly, that his creatures are in
his hands, as the clay in those of the Potter, to make some vessels of honor,
others of dishonor, according to his good will and pleasure in all things.
Moreover, they would have you to consider how grievously Albania suffers in her
Estate, by the extortion of the Usurer, and griping officer, by pride in the
excess of apparel, by gluttony, and idleness, through the multitude of
Innes, Tavernes, and Gaming houses: But I will not stay you longer with the
inconveniences that grow from hence: you better can conceive of them, and apply
fitting remedies: only let me desire you that since the beesome is put into
your hands by his Majesty's free bounty, that you would neglect no time, but be
courageous (false fires and noyses, are bugbeares only to affright children)
and having cleansed the trash that lies in open view upon the floor, you would
ransacke every little corner of this great house, and sweep down the spiders
with their cob-webs of treachery and oppression from each window therein,
plucking down the nests of all swallow flatterers, from the top of ehe
chimnies, and casting all the filth out of doors, shut them so fast, and lock
them so sure, that no false key may be able to give admittance hereafter to any
that would enter to defile these rooms again.

Thus ended Veridicus, and Calopolites promised to be mindful of what he had
said, and so they lovingly parted, one to the Assembly, and the other to
Albania, whom at his coming he found walking in her chamber, and his Lady
Aletheia with her two kinswomen Agatha, and Fidelia in her company, by whom
she had been much comforted. But when Veridicus (after due salutations to
each of them) had acquainted her with what was past, and of the hopeful
proceedings in the Parliament, and the confideration of her cause, she was
beyond measure cheered with the pleasing news.

But Alethei^ the mean while was schooling Agnoa a simple seduced virgin, which
in her journey toward Idolana (by good chance mistaking the way) fell upon
this place and company, and liked them so well, that she had no mind, seeing
the times begin to alter (so hot was her zeal) to travel farther, but desired
to be entertained for some time in the house, and service of Albania. But
Agnoa, (said the Lady) are you so taken up with this fond conceit, to find more
holiness in Idolana, than in your own Country? Do you think it any way
commendable to take such a long and dangerous journey, to kiss the foot of a
proud Prelate (if that favor may be granted) and receive the benediction from
a man of many infirmities? Silly girl! that can be persuaded to call him thy
Holy Father, who neither cares for God nor man: for he thrusts himself into
the seat of the one, and excommunicateth, and deposes the other, of what
degree soever. If he did fear God, he would not so derogate from his honor,
and attribute so much to nature, Saints, Merits; He would not persecute his
servants under the name of Heretics, for opposing his pride, and avarice,
imputing such errors of doctrine to them, as they neither acknowledge, but
profess the contrary, only to color his actions, and bring them into hatred
with those too credulous ignorants, whose belief is only fastened upon his
elbowes. But what means it to say the Athanasian Creed has as much in it as
is necessary to be believed, and yet to condenme those of Heresy, whose Creed
with that of Athanasius is all one? But truly he does not so much oppose their
tenets, as defend his own errors. It is not so much for any untruth of that
they believe, as that with their Articles of Faith, according to Gods Word,
they receive not alike his traditions (additions) withal, that they are
condemned for Heretics. Now see the equity of the man, and hereby consider
the holiness of your father, humble man, servant of servants, with a triple
Crown, and Princes for his lackies, riding in all pomp, or carried upon men's
shoulders. Chaste Priest, making marriage a Sacrament, but holding it less
sin for a shaveling to lie with a concubine, than to wed a wife* What should
I mention the toleration, and yearly rent of his public stews, or of the
continency of his Votaries, and how salacious in their Covents, witness so
many skulles, and relics of murdered infants. Religious Votary, that have
left the world for a cloister, and renounced the riches thereof to sell
Indulgences, grant Dispensations, give Orders, and Titles, free souls out of
a feigned Purgatory for mere charity, (for Omnia venalia Rome, was the saying
of old) yea to allot so many years of pardon before the sins are committed!
Temperate Saint, who countest it a true fast to abstain from flesh, and the
mean while to feast, and surfeit on greater delicates! Holy Masse-monger, that
speak untruths in an unknown language to the ignorant people, who coming
to see what is spoken, and as little understanding what they see, worship they
know not what! But good Lord! what monsters does he make of thy Saints? How
many heads, arms, legs, and other members have they to be worshipped? how
many garments? how many pieces of the holy Cross? how many nails does he
suffer to be adored? what abundance of milk had the Virgin Mary to be reserved
unto these times, for the increase of Idolana^s treasury? what an extraordinary
work of piety for the Angels to transport her palace from Jerusalem to
Loretto? Christian policy, to get what huge sums of money, by this or other
lying Miracles: But how many Ladies are there? whilst one has her name from
this Church, another from that? what strange Saints does the Pope make? (and he
can canonize so many as he pleases) some of traitors, some of such as were
persecutors of good men, and some of shadows, coined in the Idea of his
imagination, and well suspected never to have been more, than by the fabulous
report of foolish Legends, which are commonly repeated in the Sermons of the
Friars, to withdraw the memories, and minds of their hearers from the love of
the sacred Oracles. But to hear what blasphemies, and absurdities are
contained therein, any modest ear would blush, and the Reader that made
conscience of truth, would be altogether ashamed. But why stir I this filthy
puddle? what does not this pretended undertaker to manage all things in heaven
and earth presume? He can make of a creature a God, as of bread in the
Sacrament of the Eucharist by the virtue of Transubstantiation: He can make
God as a creature, by turning the glory of God into the similitude of a
corruptible creature. This Agnoa is thy holy Father, so omnipotent, and so rare
a wonder worker. And I am not so much ashamed of thy gross ignorance (that may
well be called the mother of such devotion) but of great Potentates and worldly
wise politicians (so well do carnal doctrines agree with great wealth, and
projects) that love to be blindfolded, and stumble in the dark in such a
Sunshine of the Gospel, and light of the truth, as shines round about them*
and yet they (as that silly old woman in Seneca, though she were stark blind,
would not be persuaded that she could see nothing was caused only by the
darkness of the room, and no defect of her eyesight) will make no question
but that they only are in the right, and will maintain the infallibility of
their supreme guider, and defend with tooth and nail, lies and wonders,
treasons and murders, by clipping of Orthodoxe truths with an Index
expurgato^ius, or harsh censure, and clapping in forged inventions, and
manifest falsehoods into many of those learned Authors works, and treasure them
up in the Archives of their Babylonish Vatican* that (according to the belief,
and after the manner of their forefathers) they as the true Catholics of
Verana, are only within the pales of the Church, and that all such as are
otherwise minded are capital heretics, and worthy by sword and fire to be
rooted out from the face of the earth, and the society of mankind. But thanks
be to the Almighty that takes our part, so that (rage how they will) we shall
never be left wholly to their power, although for our sins they may prove
sometimes (as the Canaanites to the children of Israel in those times) thorns
to our sides* It shall be for a trial to bring us to repentance, and cause us
to stick more near unto our God, whom whilst we only serve will against all
enemies tempopall or spiritual mightily defend us: but those which in this
manner strive against him, are worthy in my judgment (I am not so uncharitable
to have them drowned, and so to perish body and soul) to be set up to the chin
in the mad man's poole, till they come to see their folly, and be capable of
some recovery: and thus Agnoa (said thee) must you be dealt with, if you mean
to stay here, or shortly resolve to recant your errors without delay, and
declare your mind plainly without any equivocation* or mental reservation.
Agnoa, who was (as it seems) of a very flexible disposition, and somewhat
easy to be wrought upon, as having neither Sophistry, nor subtle
distinctions, to set a fair color upon a foul matter, nor impudency flatly
to deny, or contradict those apparent truths, which Aletheia had delivered; and
being out of the sight, and advise of any Erra Pater, that might dissuade her,
promised to be ruled by their counsel.

When Astene, one of Albania's faithful servants, and that was very careful
of her Mistresses welfare, and guilty of nothing so much (if tenderness of
conscience in things indifferent be an error) as of too nice restraint of
Christian liberty, when she saw that Agnoa, whose breeding and condition did so
much differ from hers, was like to be admitted for a fellow servant, she could
not brook it upon any terms, and was about in a passionate way, to show some
tokens of her displeasure, but that Aletheia (who well knew her nature)
perceiving, and much misliking, by the way of prevention first began.

Astene (said she) you need not be so much troubled (as by your countenance
appears) in that we have condescended to the request of Agnoa, wherein we do
neither approve, nor mean to bear with her ignorance and error; but hoping
some good may be wrought upon her by reclaiming her from her wrong opinion, and
instructing her in the knowledge of the truth, I am sure you cannot be so much
her enemy as to begrudge her the one, nor so uncharitable, as not to join your
helping hand with ours in the other. Let not her simpleness cause in you
either disdain, or contempt, and consider that no one can presume to know so
much, but that there is a great deal more to learn, neither need you be
ashamed in somethings to be better informed. I confess you are very zealous in
your profession, and (I believe) without dissimulation (and there cannot be too
much zeal in matters that concern immediately the glory of God) but in some
causes zeal must be moderated with discretion, when a circumstance may be used
or not; and the worship of God no ways lessened, or the more furthered
thereby;* in which respect Obedience is better than Sacrifice. Bear you with
Agnoa's infirmities, as those which are stronger bear with your weaknesses.
Consider, we hate no ones person, but their ill qualities; and we judge (...)
to be so bad, as to deny him our prayers, and endeavors for his amendment. His
obstinacy (when there is occasion) shall not diminish our charity. We do not
detest Idolana so much, as not to desire, or be glad of her reformation in
Doctrine and Manners. We depart only from her corruptions, as she is departed
from the purer times, and Primitive Doctors. We go no further from the
falsehood of her traditions, but as we may come nearer to the truth of Gods
Word. I wish her Doctrine were as consonant unto ours, as ours is to the
Scriptures, and so agreeing with Us in Ceremonies, as we are different from it
in superstitions. We do not any good we do the more as in opposition to her,
but because it is commanded: and do not take the contrary of her actions to be
the best rule to square our devotions. Wherein she erres not from the truth,
we may not dissent from her. Who would hate the good conditions of any man for
the rest of the bad qualities in him? Who would fast the rather, or eat f^sh
only upon Fridaies, if the Papist should eat nothing but flesh that day? or
who would make invitations the sooner upon those days designed by our
adversaries to abstinence? Or, what Minister of the Gospel would be the less
scrupulous to say his Service in white, if he did know a Priest of Idolana
without Cope or other like Vestment to say his Mass in black? What
hindrances are decent garments, and gestures of the body to the devotions of
the heart? whilst I pray with understanding, hear for my edification, worship,
and give thanks in spirit and truth? The habit may present it self to my
eyes, it is the Doctrine shall go to mine heart. Outward shows and
ceremonies, have their external respects, and serve as handmaids to wait on,
and not to sit down with Religion their Mistress. Now for these acts of
indifferency, shall not I do what is good and commendable, because the ill
minded abuse the same act to Will Worship and Superstition? The Heathens of old
had their Altars, Sacrifices, Temples, Priests. Did therefore the Patriarchs,
or Gods people of those ages abstain from the worshipping of God by Sacrifices
upon Altars by prayers, and invocations in Temples, by their Priests: But as
we may not leave the use of any lawful thing for the abuse* of it, so we may
use a good thing in the same manner the wicked does without offense, nay we
should offend if we did do it otherwise. And therefore if any Papist make his
Prayer to God only in the name of Christ, I may not pray otherwise. As far
in his Creed as he goes with the Word of God, and Orthodoxe consent, I am to
go hand in hand with him. Nay if the devil himself confess Christ to be the
Son of God, my confession therefore must not be otherwise. Perchance you are
afraid by yielding obedience to these indifferent ceremonies in respect of
Religion you shall give offense to a weak Christian. But is it convenient that
to fancy one you should displease a multitude, or for fear of offending the
Subject, care not to disobey the command of your Magistrate? Shall not I bow or
kneel to God in the performance of holy duties, for fear lest I give
suspicion of Idolatry, because the Heathens use this gesture in their
Idolatrous adorations? Shall I not look toward the East when I pray, because
the Pagans worship the rising of the Sun with their faces t^rned that way?
nor to the West for fear of Judaisme? to the North, lest I seem to respect
the witches of Biarmia? nor to the South, lest I be thought to favor the
imposture of Mahomet? Which way then shall I turn mine eyes when I worship?
God sees every where, his eyes are upon all the quarters of the world alike.
What disorder, Astene, would there be in Religion, to teach and allow obedience
unto Princes, and yet reserve a liberty to our selves of infringing his equal
Laws, and make ceremonies to be of the substance of Religion by denying an
indifferency in them; whilst they trench not upon the rights of our belief,
nor against good order, either in quantity or quality? Suppose the same, as I
said before, to be used by Idolaters, yet was Asa and other Kings of Israel
commended for pious: neither did the Prophets forsake their country or charges,
although the high places were not taken away with the abuses presently. O
Astene, disdain not the Church for her spots. Stumble not at strawes to the
grief and disturbance of Christian peace. If your own Conscience cannot yet
persuade you of the truth of these things, seek not to be master of another
liberty, nor forsake not the society of the Church, where there is agreement in
the chief materials for mere circumstances and forms. And where find you any
precise Text for standing more than kneeling, or for wearing of a black coat
rather than a white surplesse. In these things it is not good to be overwise:
and if any will be contentious (says not the least of the Apostles) we have no
such custom, nor the Churches of God. Be not so curious whilst you view the
Threshold, to neglect the inside of the Temple: and whilst you quarrel at what
seems wanting, you become ungrateful for what you have. Be thankful for the
free enjoyment of the means of salvation in the Word truly preached, and
Sacraments duly administered. Hereabout spend thy thoughts, employ thy
meditations, and accordingly bend all thy endeavors, and practices. Leave the
government of the several Churches to their own Magistrates, to whom it
appertains. Stick not at names and degrees of authority in the Ministry,
according to the eminency of their gifts, and the bounty of their superiors.
If some be Doctors, other Pastors, and Teachers, of a meaner rank; if some be
as Elders to rule and over-see, others but as Deacons and Ministers, to be set
on work in the Lords vineyard; all are but servants alike to their great
Master, who does employ them, and must pay them their wages. A Bishop, and
every Minister have different respects in their functions concerning the
Ceremonies, not the Doctrine of the Church: If they have any dignity above
their fellow Ambassadors, they have the greater charge imposed upon them, and
they exercise not Lordship over the Church, but as brethren rule with all
humbleness and integrity. And as their places are greater, their life and
conversation is more illustrious: for they are as lights set upon the top of
the hill, that they may be seen farthest; they are as ears and eyes, which
members are placed in the highest part of the body, because they are of
chiefest use in the same. If they be not rightly qualified, as they ought, nor
discharge the trust committed unto them, as they should, their title, and
dignity will be more for their condemnation, than their excuse, and when the
time of account comes, that every man shall receive wages according to his
work, their candles shall be put out: when others that have been more
diligent and faithful in the employment of their talents to their Masters best
advantage, for five shall receive ten; and in them the prediction of the
Prophet shall be truly accomplished, They that be wise shall shine as the
brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness, shall
shine as the Stars for ever and ever.

Now Astene, I have been the longer in my speech, not to divert, but to direct
thy zeal. and I must needs commend this in thee, that thou art not lukewarm
in thy profession: but I hope thou art not so much conceited of any perfection
in thy ways, as that thou need not information: nor of so little charity to
construe these instructions in the worst sense, as to be swayed more by the
custom of the times, then the validity of truth and reason.

Aletheia had scarce ended, when Neophytes (who was there attendant, and
desired to be retained for a Chapplaine to Albania) saw that Astene was thus
reproved, who had so often taken exceptions (and not without cause) to some
wild courses of his, and that she could not well reply to the reasons of
Aletheia without cavil, or impertinencie, could not refrain from smiling, and
withal to upbraid the modest virgin (which he of all others had least reason
to do) with the strictness of her opinion; and now over strait laced Astene,
says he, you that are so precise, and such a Puritan, have you nothing to say
in the defense of your own cause, and yet presume to be an instructor of
others? But when Aletheia perceived that Astene was much abashed at his
reproof, and that he triumphed upon her weakness, not for any love to the
truth, but the more to bolster up his own loosnesse, Fie Neophytes (said she)
I am ashamed that a man of your profession and parts should be thus light in
your actions, and uncircumspect in your speeches. I see you do not consider the
dignity of your calling, nor the duty of your charge; the one does require more
gravity in your carriage, the other more charity in your words. Ministers
cannot be too cautious in their speeches, and should be as children and lambs
without offense. A jest or scurrilous word toward the meanest of your
brethren, should be as far from your tongues, as malice from your heart. It
is more uncouth (said one well) to see a Minister wanton, or light in
discourse, or behavior, than it was for Socrates to ride upon a stick with
children, or for old grave Cato to learn to fiddle. If Astene have offended
(and her offense is the more pardonable, because not wilful) it should be your
part to pity her weakness, not to make sport of it; and seek to inform her
judgment better, by mild and loving admonitions, rather than to grieve her, or
make her any way contemptible by your scorn. But why tell I these things to
you that know them so well, and teach them to others? But here Agnoa, who all
this while had been very attentive to what was spoken, could be no longer
silent. The truth is (said she) the common report is such in Idolana, that the
Preachers in Verana have as many Beliefes as Sects, and almost as many Sects as
heads, so that every year they coin some new point of Doctrine, and their
Ministers, which are the setters abroach, and teachers thereof, do least of all
believe what they teach, for the most part are so licentious in their lives,
and given to their ease and liberty, that it cannot be thought that they think
that to be true in their hearts, which they speak with their tongues. And this
is the cause that many in Idolana are deterred from consenting with you in
opinion, or of joining with you in practice. Stay* Agnoa, not too fast, said
Aletheia, the worst spoake in the wheel creakes first: you are too credulous
of reports, as of other your superstitions: and where you have the least hint
of any thing to work upon, you will make of mole hills mountains. I cannot
excuse the courses, nor conditions of many in Verana, that by the manner of
their living lay themselves open to censure and scandal. There is no
Pomegranate wherein there may not be some grains rotten, but what is this to
the sound fruit? But if you will be impartial, and look upon the manners of
the Priests, and fraternities of most orders in Idolana, you shall find them
far to transcend in number, and nature the worst of ours, and in some sort to
justify their actions: but the corruption of manners (that they say and do
not) does not proceed from the purity of Doctrine in any professors, nor the
more prove it, I speak not this to extenuate the faults of our Ministers, or
to aggravate those of the Priests in Idolana. Where there is corn, there will
be some tares in all fields; and for the diversity of Sects, that are imputed
to the disgrace of Verana, whilst our differences are about matters of
circumstance, and not of substance, let the scandal return from whence it
came, and Idolana keep it home to her self; whilst her Doctrines are as many
as her errors, and her errors so many, that it would require more time than I
mean to afford in counting the least part of them.

But Neophytes (said she) I would nevertheless have you to be very careful
of your ways, to be in no wise Cynicall, or surly in your carriage toward the
meanest; that you give no just cause to the enemy to speak ill of the truth by
means of your conversation. Nor you, Astene, to wrangle so much about a
ceremony, that the Doctrine be ill spoken of by your wilful opposition. And I
would have both prefer the Glory of God, and the general good of the Church
before any private pleasure or respects: and so far condescend to comply with
each others weakness, as God be not dishonored, nor the parcel of truth
betrayed to the obloquy of the common enemy. And think not Neophytes, that I
usurp this liberty of speech to disparage your worth or calling: I know it is
the most honorable of all others, and they that employ themselves diligently
therein are worthy of double honor. You are, (if rightly qualified) the
Ambassadors of the most High God, and King of Kings, and cannot be ignorant
what care and circumspection there is required of Ambassadors in their words
and behavior, lest they be disrespected for the one, and their judgment
questioned for the other. You are termed the Lights of the Word, and your light
must not be hidden under a bushel, but so shine before men that they may see
your good works, and glorify your heavenly Father. Your light must be clear
as burning, for the candle must be set on a candlestick, and not have too much
snuff in it. You are called the salt of the earth, and therefore ought to be
seasoned with ability of knowledge to teach, with holiness of life to give
example, that you may be profitable to the Church, both by Doctrine and
Conversation. You are named Shepherds, to lead your flock in the right way,
and to feed them in the best pastures. You are Gods husbandmen to dress his
vineyard, to work in his harvest; ( the harvest is great, the laborers are
few) your time is but short, your diligence must be the more in your study, in
the Church, in visiting the sick, and in all other practices of Piety, and
Charity, that come within the compass, and verge of your charge. But beware
especially of Covetousness, and seek more the gain of your peoples souls to
God, than of their goods to your selves. If they be forgetful of their duties,
be not you therefore of yours. Be not transported with passion, and no
unseemly, or uncharitable surmises in your Doctrine, nor consume your precious
time in invectives against the persons of any, or in disquisition of
impertinent truths, new opinions, school querkes, or needless controversies:
but let the end of your calling always have the chief place in your thoughts,
and endeavors. And when you are in the Pulpit, you must have a grounded
assurance for what you deliver: I would have you strive to speak to the
understanding of the Auditory, rather than to show the strength of your
understanding: to deliver such matter as may be more for their edification,
than your own applause: may more benefit the heart, than fancy the ear, and
show that you seek more to profit, than to please. So whilst you strive to
glorify God, and do good to his Church, you shall find your reward to be
great, and your pains at last thoroughly recompensed: and therefore Neophytes,
I hope you will take this advice in good part, and though you know better, what
belongs to the discharge of your office (I should count him an unworthy
Minister, that is ignorant of that which he has undertaken) it cannot be
displeasing unto you to be put in mind thereof, and to see what a friend thinks
of it. I could say more, but you are of understanding to conceive what I would
by the premises: and I could say no less, such is the love and esteem I bear
toward the increase of religion, and honor of the Church.

But no sooner had Aletheia concluded this speech, when the noise of the people
(hearing of some hopes of Albania's recovery) that were come together to visit
her, was so great, and their desire so earnest to see their Lady on foot, whose
health did so much concern the safety of their estate, that Albania must of
necessity present her self to the sight of all, and therefore she (glad Lady)
descending into the great Hall, where they waited her coming, and having
received their presents in sign of gratulation, she lovingly thanked them all;
and after a short exhortation to them to continue in love and amity amongst
themselves, she dismissed them with great content: but a few of the better sort
she caused to stay, and led them up to the Chamber where Aletheia was, to
whose knowledge and acquaintance she presented and commended them, as some of
her sincere friends, and true well-wishers.

Aletheia who could soon dive into the disposition of each nature, and knew
how to accost each sort with a due respect, giving to every of them a kind
salute, after some pause, when she beheld that they earnestly fixed their eyes
on her, and were silent, and attentive to hear (for Abania had before prepared
them to that purpose, and requested Aletheia in their behalf) what she would
say or command, to give both satisfaction, she thus began.

My Masters and Friends of Albania, happy in the enjoyment of a gracious
Sovereign, and a fertile Country, I must needs commend your love to Albania,
and care of her welfare. And to tell you the truth, she has been of late
afflicted with a great distemper, and though the case be much better with her
than it has been, through her Princes bounty, and the considence she has in
the fair proceedings of a general Assembly: yet the means of a perfect cure
and restitution of her to her former strenght, lies mainely in your care, for
the performance of such duties toward God, and your King, as Religion, and
loyalty binds you to. And give me leave, since you offered me the occasion, to
tell you without flattery, that the chief root of all your miseries is in
your selves; and therefore, I would not have you out of any self-love, or
sinister respect, wholly to lay the burden of this great mis-happe befalne to
Albania, upon foreign or higher causes, (though these may be made instruments
thereof, justly for your punishment) nor for the remedy to depend principally
upon any earthly means, no not the Policy and Honesty of the wisest heads in
your Assembly, (their knowledge and power is but humane, they are men, and may
err) but you must look home, and reflect your thoughts upon the consideration
of your own ways for the one, and with humble minds, lift up your minds
higher, to be made partakers of the other. There is a just God above that has
been, and daily is, offended with your heinous miscarriages, and wherein have
not the best of you, some ways offended his Divine Majesty? Of ill thoughts
and secret transgressions, you are most conscious your selves, but those vices
which walk in public view, and are acted in open face of the Sun, amongst
all sorts of people, more or less, do convince the truth of what I speak,
and to which your own consciences cannot but be witnesses. Is not Idolatry
grown to that height, almost to counterchecke true Religion amongst you by the
increase of Popery. Are not the Articles of our Belief questioned? Is not
Religion minced, and new fashioned by some that take too much liberty, to dally
with matters of conscience? I appeal to those which are learned, which are
like the Sun, whose brightness all admire, but no one can endure to look
upon. Priefely, I cannot stand to make a catalogue of vices; Is there not much
murmuring, distrust, and oppression in your griping Usurer, and covetous
Officers? Is there not excessive Pride, covetousness (which Aristotle in his
Politiques calls the Extremity of Poverty) gluttony (with lust and idleness,
its consequences) in the wealthy? Is there not much malice, envy, and ambition,
in such as so greedily seek after preferment and promotion? Is there not too
much equivocation and falsehood in the Tradesman to sell his wares, and vent his
commodities? Is there not too much blasphemy, cruelty, and rapine in the
Soldier, that follows the war in a desperate mood, only to kill or he
killed? What contention and multitude of Lawsuites for want of Charity, do
abound in every corner? How hard hearted are many, in giving of alms, or
relieving the wants of a distressed Brother? What neglect and formality in Cods
Worship? How unaccustomed and dull are the spirits of most in the performing
their ordinary works of Devotion, and about Religious Exercises? I do touch
at the heads: There are so many instances, and so well known to you of
particulars, that I shall but needlessly trouble you and Albania with their
repetition. But instead of avoiding such and the like abuses, many are come to
this height of impudence, as to shadow their vices under the habit of virtues.
Drunkenness passes with them for good fellowship: Prodigality is termed
bounty: Covetousness misnamed good husbandry: Ambition has the note of a
brave mind and gallant spirit: Revenge is eryed up for the mark of valor and
preservation of Honor: Pride is accounted fashionable handfomnesse and
decency: Extortion and Oppression denote much policy and worldly wisdom.
When, on the contrary, in religious matters, Virtues are commonly dosamed with
the stain of their opposite vidos So be that is Zealous in his Profession, is
counted factious: He that reproves the sins and cnormities of the time, a
busie-body: If a man partake not in lewdness with such as tempt him to bear
them company therein, it is by reason of some self-conceit: If a man put up an
injury, suffer an affront, he is esteemed a Coward, or of a base spirit: If he
be liberal to those that want, heis a waster, and careless spender of his
estate, and may want himself before he dye: If he be temperate, continent, and
spend not his time jovially in merry compauy, and pastime, he is thought to be
proud, singular, or melancholicke: His Devotion is condemned for hypocrisy,
his reproof goes for malice; what is reason in others, in him is but opinions:
Whereas the same man, would he but flatter, and humor men in their conditions,
bear with their manners, and applaud all their courses, this were the only
man, and worthy all respect. I speak not these things, as accusing you to be
guilty, although I know, you are somewhat too conformable to the times, and too
much seek your own ease. The public good is more in your talk, but I doubt
me your private gain is more in your aim. But if it go not well with the
general, your case must needs be lameutable. And there fore, I would have you
timely redress such errors, as you find your selves to be most guilty of, and
reclaim others by your counsel and persuasions. You must not make any arm of
flesh your stay, nor lay any false grounds in your imagination, that if things
succeed according to your fancy, all will be well. Whilst God is offended,
nothing can continue long well: therefore he must in the first place, and at
all times be sought unto, by tears and Prayers. You must meet him with red
eyes, blubbered cheeks, pale visage, pensive soul, protestations of humility,
importunities for mercy. There must be a true humiliation for sins past, a
settled purpose of amendment. You must pinion the wings of all high conceits of
your own worth, and expiate fore-past vices, with a sacrifice of the contrary
virtues: And then I will assure you, that if all the forces of the world were
banded against you for your overthrow; if all the subtle brains, and
politic Machiavilians of Idolana were set together on work, their close or
open plots to subvert your Religion, or endammage your state, should prove but
spiders webbes or twists of hemp with Achitophel and Haman, to choke their
Authors: You shall enjoy your Liberties, Privileges, Religion, Peace, with as
great freedom as heretofore.

And now in the second place, I must advise you, as you be careful to give
unto God those things which are Gods: so to render those things which are
Caesar's, unto Caesar, custom to whom custom, tribute to whom tribute
belongs. You must acknowledge (as loyal Subjects) that your King is Gods
supreme Deputy, set over you to rule and govern you in all matters, Civil
and Ecclesiasticke. You may not prescribe him, in what manner you will be
ruled, nor by what means. You may contest with him, if he offer wrong, by way
of Supplication, and not of Dispute. If his Commands be just, you must
willingly obey them: and herein what he enjoynes strictly, you must, according
to the utmost of your power, readily put in execution. But if he command any
thing directly against the glory of God, the contrary of which God commands,
Whether it be better to obey God or Men, judge you. But in this case, there
must be sufferance of the penalty, and no resistance against the authority of
your Prince. And for the wrong he seeks to do you, you must seek to God, to
set him in the Right, though he take away your Liberties, Goods, and lives,
contrary to all Laws and Equity: Yea, even to those, the performance of which
(though by force he may not be constrained) in Conscience he is bound. Yet you
must not curse him in your heart, nor touch a lap of his garment with such a
thought, for he is the Lords Anointed. But what spend I breath in these things?
You have a Religious and gracious Prince, one that is zealous of Gods Glory,
and will be careful of your good. You need not fear that he will be persuaded
to any thing that shall oppose the one, or hinder the other. He will not wrong
his own Soul, to hurt you in your Estates, or Persons. He well knows, that
though he is not to be accountable to men, he has a wiser, and stricter Judge
(if he do not execute the charge committed unto him, in some sort as he
should) will call him to account at last, because this High place and Authority
over others, was not committed unto him for his own pleasure and ease, but for
his Masters glory, and the benefit of the Church. And therefore, Prayers and
Supplications ought to be made incessantly unto God, for his preservation and
safety above all others: For where the Prince is good, that people of all
others have most cause to rejoice, and bless God for him, and strive to please
him in all his just desires. And in this respect, it must be far from you to
wish him any ill, to speak of him without beseeming respect, much more to
join in any council or confederacy with his enemies, and most of all to take
up arms, except at his Command, and for his defense. You ought not to murmr
against his proceedings, nor speak ill of his Officers, or Commissioners, upon
every slight suspicion.

Charity will counterpoise the distractions of many occurrences: but rashness,
and inconsiderateness in judgment, is an impetuous Passion, which bears
down all Reason. When things go not as they should, and you know not who is
in blame; cry down no man merely upon report, but leave offenders to the
trial of the Laws, by their competent Judges. But when you are required, or
any thing comes to your knowledge, which may prove dangerous to the State, not
to be partial in Affection, to tremble at the sight of a high Tower, or guild
a mudded wall, or fear the countenance of any man; (For time and justice will
wear out the dreams and plots of wicked policy, and strenghten the fair
proceedings of Truth and Honesty) but boldly and impartially to discover what
you know. And whenever it shall be thought fit by the States and Commons, and
that the Kings necessities and occasions so require, to be furnished with a
supply of moneys; that then without further question, you cheerfully
contribute what shall be so imposed: And by your voluntary benevolences, as
time and your abilities shall give you leave to testify that true affection
and love to him, which you pretend.

And these supplies will be with far greater ease disbursed, if you please to
substract but somewhat from your superfluities: turn some of your excessive
and often feastings into fasts, or fewer dishes: take something from the price
and trimming of your garments. Use such as may serve for decency and
convenience: but be not like Antiques or like Apes to follow every new fashion.
Restrain somewhat from your gamings and expenses of idle hours. Your appetite
shall be never the less satisfied, and your bodies more healthy. Your attire
according to your degree and calling shall not a jot be the more indecent, nor
your bodies the less warm.

Besides, the more Velvets and Silks are forborne, our own clothes shall be
in wear, and the poor better set on* work in making of them. You shall find
ways enough of more thrifty recreation, and have more comfort in the redeeming
of your precious time, then in any mispending of it. And now I have showed you
my advise as plainly as I can: and (it being my use, howsoever it be taken, to
do good unto all, as occasion shall be offered) as I held my self in duty
bound. And with this she paused, and they that heard her with great content,
took their leave, with promise for their parts, and in the behalf of the rest
that were absent, to be more careful of their carriage, and respectfull of
their duty toward God and their Sovereign.

Aletheia, likewise would have taken her leave of Albania for some time, seeing
her well onwards on the mending hand, but was interrupted by an occasion, which
was unworthy her stay, or the relation, but that you may see what cruelty there
is in the nature of a covetous wretch.

Thus it happened, Albania's servants hearing a great lamentation and cry at
their Ladies gate, went forth to see what it meant. Where they saw two
Sergeants dragging a poor man to prison for another debt, who desired that
Albania would take some pity on his case, and his Wife, and Children that made
this great moan, with earnest entreaties and tears besought the like.
Whereupon one of the servants called Eleos, ran in presently, and acquainted
his Lady with their request, who beingstill ready to further a work of
Charity, (and the rather because Aletheia was then in place) gave present
command that they should bring the Prisoner, and the party that sought this
extremity against him, to her presence, and she would request Aletheia to be
Judge in the cause: so by virtue of her command, the parties were both brought
where the Ladies were. And truly the covetous wretch would not by any
entreaties have been persuaded to have come of himself, so much did he
abhor the company of such as were charitably minded, and was so afraid to
look Authority in the face: but by the way he could not forbear cursing, and
swearing, with fearful imprecations, that he would not lose a penny by any
man. In the mean while, the poor man had acquainted the Ladies that the debt
was none of his own; but that he had engaged himself by Bond to see him paid:
that the debt was but small at the first, but that it had run on so ^^rre,
that the Use exceeded the Principal: and the Creditour might have had his
money long ere this, but that he was careless to take it in upon his Security,
and intended when he saw time to take his best advantage: and that he now sued
him (whiles the Principal had wherewith to satisfy) who was unable, if he
should fell all he had, to pay so great a sum, and if he were laid in prison,
his Wife, and Children were quite undone. This hard case of the poor man, and
cruelty of the other, drew tears of pity from the eyes of the compassionate
Ladies, and with all anger and disdain, forced a red color in their cheeks.
Thou unnatural wretch (said Aletheia) what moved thee to be so hard hearted
against a poor man that owes thee nothing, nor has any thing to pay?

The cruel Plutos, for so was he named, as wretched in condition, as crooked in
Limbs, and wrinckled in countenance; as miserable in soul and poor in
goodness, as ragged and patched in garments, could not deny what the poor man
said, nor* would make any direct answer, to what was demanded, but still he
insisted upon this tone, Give me my money, I will have the forfeiture of my
Bonds, and Mortgages; I will be paid the Interest of my moneys to a Farthing.
To a farthing! (said Alitheia) is this thy Religion? Religion! (replied he)
tell them of Religion that care for it; Let me have my Money. Vile Atheist
(said she) do thou prefer thy* trash and pelf before the Service of God,
and thy salvation? Yea (said the Idiot) that I do, and before Heaven also.
This* world I know, that other I do not. God grant me to live still on earth,
let him keep Heaven for himself. Speak of me what you will, so I may gain
by it. If you be all hanged or drowned, I care not. Let this poor fool that
had no more wit, but to bring himself within danger of my mercy, rot in
Prison. Let his Wife and Children starve, let all his friends curse me, I shall
thrive never the worse. These, and other like devilish speeches* this
Earthworme uttered, so that Albania paled, Aletheia was sore afrighted, and
both could not endure to hear the Monster any longer, but commanded the poor
man to be set at liberty, and sent him home with some gifts to boot.

Aletheia would have given some counsel to the wretch, but thinking it not fit
at this time to cast Pearl before Swine, she bid them cast him out upon the
Dunghill among his companions, and in the mean while keep him there, till
some other punishment might be devised for him, and such like, by the Honorable
Court of Parliament.

And surely it would draw a great blessing upon this Kingdom, if his Majesty
and Council would take into their consideration the cruel ways of oppression
and vexation used toward the poorer sort, and other by those who, that they may
raise a great estate to themselves, care not how they come by it, though it be
with the ruin of whole Familes.

But whilst the Ladies were thus disquieted by the late event, Chronos was
come in post to fetch Aletheia to the general Assembly, who at this time
greatly needed her presence. Who presently went away with him, having taken
leave of Albania, and left her in the company of Agatha and Fidelia, and many
other of her trusty servants, to whom Albania committing the care of her
affairs, and shutting the doors of her Chamber, lay down upon her Couch a
while to take some repose, and being laid, fell into a sweet sleep. But the
Ladies that staid by her, rejoicing that their Lady took her rest so quietly,
and that a small noise would not awake her, took each her Instrument, and
having played a while thereon, and seeing Albania stirred not the while, began
altogether thus to sing.

COme Sions Singers, sit all round,
And each with voice and instrument,
The sweetest strains of music sound,
That Art, or fancy can invent.
And all together loudly sing
The praises of our Heavenly King.
Likewise ye holy Shepherd swains,
Well skilled in Songs and Temple-^ayes,
Whilst that your flocks graze on the Plains,
Chaunt bymnes unto Jehovahs praise.
And let the Quire with Echoes ring
Of praises of our Heavenly King.
Dear Heralds of our God proclaim,
In those assemblies where you meet,
The joy of our Jerusalem,
With Hallelujahs publish it:
That all which hear the same, may sing
The praises of our heavenly King.
Each age, each sex, and each degree,
That love their King, the Church and State,
Those hopes returned with joy may see,
Were almost gone and lost of late.
Then have not all just cause to sing
The praises of our heavenly King?
Me thought of late mine eyes did mark
A gentle dove fly through the air,
With Olive branch, when the shrill Lark
To heavenward flew chirping, where
Angels and Saints in Anthemes sing
The praises of our heavenly King.
Cheer up sad hearts and you shall see
All storms of fear will shortly cease:
Your sighs to songs shall turned be,
And tales of war to tunes of Peace.
Instead of mourning all shall sing
The praises of our Heavenly King.
The Winter lasts not all the year,
The longest night must yield to day,
When that the Sun begins to clear,
All mists and clouds must pack away.
And now is time for us to sing
The praises of our Heavenly King.
Sleep on Albania, worthy Dame,
And in thy Princes grace be bold;
Those wished thy woes shall find their shame,
Their plots of mischief will not hold.
They now shall wail, but thou shall sing
The praises of our heavenly King.
God bless King, Lords, and Commons all,
With hearts true love, and minds consent.
Let no mischance to them befall,
Whilst that they sit in Parliament.
So shall King, Lords, and Commons sing
The Praises of our Heavenly King.
ANd now Albania, whether satisfied with the sweet repose she had taken, or
wakened with the pleasant music of the voices, start up as from a trance with
this joyful Acclamation.

Ah happy Albania, happy Sovereign, and happy Vnita! and this she uttered with
a most cheerful countenance (the Index of a like heart) and hereupon paused;
when to her Ladies desiring to know the reason of this her exultation, she thus
replied, that she had great cause to speak what she did, finding her state so
well amended in all parts, and she could not in few words express the comfort
she felt, and conceived by this alteration, and thought she should be hardly
able to put a temper to the excess, but that the remembrance of her former
griefs and mishaps, and the danger of relapse, through a careless security,
together with those concernenences toward her Lord and Master, in respect of
her duty and due services in a most exact obedience, required a moderation in
her delights, and a circumspection in her behavior; but fearing she had
somewhat exceeded, and had been too passionate in the expression of her late
complaints (which she imputed to the tenderness of her nature, having not of a
long time been used to such changes) she desired the favor of the best
interpretation, protesting withal, that howsoever her speeches might seem to
savor of too much bitterness against some delinquents, her aim herein was
not to particulars, nor so much against the persons of any, as their offenses,
and therefore deserved the greater pardon; and well considering that Humanum
est errare, she hoped the parties guilty would not be so desperate to proceed
on farther in those wicked courses, so clearly discovered, but speedily
retire, and cast themselves down at the feet of his Majesty's clemency, and
make some recompense to the injuryed parties, by their sincere amendment, and
provident endeavors for the common good: and as for those loyal hearts (the
constant friends and joint pursuers of hers and her sisters welfare) and
un-interrupted happiness (having escaped the storm at home by the miraculous
providence of the Almighty Lord,) she desired them to be nothing the more
secure in their vigilant care of future occurrences, having always a provident
eye, both at shore and to seawards, for the timely prevention of such
inconveniences as might steal on them in their own, or be intended against
them from foreign parts. And now Veridicus was returned from the Assembly, and
upon notice was quickly admitted, where he much rejoiced to see how the cause
stood with Albania, and desiring to have some conference with her in private,
the Ladies gave place, having first demanded how things went and received only
this answer, Good News.

Which the Lord long continue to his glory, the Kings honor, and the Kingdoms
safety.
