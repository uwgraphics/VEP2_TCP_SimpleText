A new Plot against Hull.
Or, A new Design to take Hull, begun and prosecuted by a company of Factious
spirits, but most auspiciously prevented.
SInce his Majesty's going down to York, many troubles and discontents have
molested that part of the Kingdom, from which the Town of Hull has not been
exempted: Since the first and second attempt made against it, there was lately
a new Design hatched and set on foot to take the same, whereby the malignant
party may the better assert their purposes, and bring to ruin the quiet estate
of the whole Kingdom: Now lately a new mischief was set on foot, being begun
by the encouragement and countenance of some factious and disquiet spirits This
design was to have surprised the Town, to have taken possession thereof, and
have gained all into their own possession but before they could accomplish
their wicked purposes, their intentions were discovered, by which means they
did desist from their purpose, so that neither the Plot it self nor the Actors
were brought to light, but in good time the Town was secured, and we hope the
Actors or confederates will be found out.

EDINBURGH the 18. of May, 1642.
THE Lords of the Privy Council of the Kingdom of Scotland, in a frequent
meeting, having according to the importance of matters of so great weight and
concernment, maturely and at length considered the several Declararations,
Messages, Answers and Instructions sent unto them from his Mujesty: As also
what has been represented unto them in the Declaration sent from the
Parliament of England, do find themselves bound in duty to acknowledge that
they esteem it no small happiness to receive true and full information from
the Fountain, and not to be left to the middle and wandering streams of
private mis-reports, which are ready to mislead such as are apt to follow them
from the right understanding of the Truth into the dangerous by-pathes of
Iealousies and Error, the preventing whereof, made the Kingdom in the time of
their late Troubles so frequently to declare themselves and their intentions
both to his Majesty and the Kingdom of England.

They do also receive and embrace with all humble respect and thankfulness
from his Majesty, the large and lively expressions of his Royal and Religious
Resolution, and care to maintain and preserve the true Religion, Liberties and
Laws of his Kingdoms, together with right correspondencie betwixt them, it
being the true and only foundation of greatness, and glory to himself and
his Posterity, and of peace and happiness to his People, for which this whole
Kingdom being straightly bound by their common Allegiance, Natural Obedience,
and National Oath, never to be forgotten, will ever most willingly and readily
spend their lives and Fortunes, and what is dearest unto them.

They do in like manner with reciprocal and Brotherly affection acknowledge
the large testimony of the care and zeal of the Parliament of England, to keep
a right understanding betwixt the two Nations, which both Par^iaments have
obliged themselves by solemn Vows and Protesta^ion, by all good means to
preserve, against which, no sinister information or mis-report shall ever make
this Kingdom to fall into such mis-construction as may be a violation of their
Vow and Protestation made in Parliament.

But in the midst of their joy and gladness, arising upon the Professions
and Protestations both of King and parliament, they cannot but profess the
unfeigned grief and great fears, which they have conceived, upon the
misunderstanding and so long rising distractions betwixt his Majesty and the
Parliament, which unless they be speedily removed, can bring forth no other
fruits, then the rejoicing and triumph of the common Enemies of our Religion
and Peace, and such a world of evils to his Majesty, and his Dominions, as
they are loath to suffer themselves to think upon, and choose rather to wrap up
in silence, wishing that they may be made never more to appear then to the
encouragement of ill-affected persons, and grief of the souls of all good men
to be expressed by words, and therefore on the one part, they are confident
that the honorable Houses of Parliament, in their great wisdom and affection,
will leave no fair and good means unattempted, to induce his Majesty to
return unto them.

That there may be a better understanding betwixt him and his People, and they
honored with his Royal power, and strengthened by his Scepter and Authority,
and although they know, that they now will nor should meddle with the public
actions of any other Kingdom then they are called interessed as fellow
Subjects under one Head or Monarchy, yet since the Honorable Houses of
Parliament have thought meet to draw the practices of the Parliament of
Scotland into Example in the point of Declaration, they are confident that the
affection of the Parliament will lead them also to the practice of this
Kingdom, in composing the unhappie Differences betwixt his Majesty and them,
and so far as may consist with the Religion, Liberties and Laws, in giving
his Majesty satisfaction, especially in the tender care of His Royal Person,
and of His Princely Greatness and Authority, which will be also the most
powerful means of settling the greatness and prosperity of that Kingdom, upon
the other (...) the deep sense of His Majestes trouble, and from the Love and
Loyalty of their hearts, their humble desire is that his Majesty may be
pleased to hearken to the earnest desires and hearty Invitaion of His peoples
entreating to his Parliament, which as it is His greatest so it is his best and
most unparalleld Counse^^, that by the brightness of His Majesty's presence and
Countenance all the Clouds of former Iealousies and fears may be scattered,
and mutual Confidenc may be revived and His people satisfied, as the only
means of Happiness both of the King and Kingdom, the resolution where upon
this Kingdom will also in crease Our happiness.

And since his Majesty has been pleased to make known unto them his
Resolution to go into Ireland in person, they are bold as his Majesty's loving
Subjects and faithful Counselors to give their humble opinions, that as they
do with their hearts acknowlge his Majesty's fatherly compassion of the
sufferings of his good Subjects by the Rebellion there, his princely endeavors
in quickening all means that may serve for their relief, and for the more
speedy and powerful suppression of the Rebels and deliverance of his people,
in offering to hazard his Royal person, then which there can be no greater
Demonstration of princely care and courage, so as by their natural affection
and by their desire of the preservation of his Majesty's person, upon which
depends the safety of these Kingdoms, constrained in all humility to report
that they conceive it to be a matter which requires more mature Deliberation.

Whether his Majesty shall hazard his own Royal Person in such a matter, and
thereby also put his good Subjects in great fears for him.

Whether the great Affairs and dangerous Distractions of the Kingdom of
England, which never did more require his Personal presence, may suffer his
Absence at this time.

Whether his going in person against such base Rebels be not a descending too
low from that high dignity and Royal eminency wherein God has placed him, as
his immediate Vicegerent, and whether it be not more for his Majesty's Honor
and Safety, and for the inward security of his People against their Fears of
danger, to his Majesty's person, and their outward quietness against dangers
to themselves, to command such Forces of his willing Subjects to go in that
expedition as by Gods help and assistance may be more then sufficient to cruse
their Rebellion, and reduce the whole Kingdom to his Majesty's obe^ience, but
concerning this wish and hope that His Majesty may be pleased to he^^e and
consider of the advice and Council of his Parliament of ^ngland, as being more
nearly concerned in the matters of Ireland although none be more in their
interest in his majesty's Royal person. In the end they do numbly entreat
that all means may be forborne which may make the breach wider, and the wound
deeper, and that no place be given to evil Spirit of Division, which at such
times works uncessantly, and rather now that the fairest, the most
expression, and compendious way be taken by so wise a King and parliament, as
may against all malice and opposition make his majesty and his posterity more
glorious, and his Kingdoms more happy then ever for this blessed end and
earnestly wished for Conclusion, according to their manifold obligations and
duty, they do offer their best endeavors, and for the present have sent the
Earl of Lowdon, and Chancellor of the Kingdom, who will give a more full
Declaration of their mind and desires.
