THE PROPHECY OF HUMPHREY TINDAL Vicar of Wellenger.
THE time will come as true as the Creed,
Of Priests and Clerks we shall have no need,
Churches shall fall, it shall be no wonder,
For the Clergy and Laity shall be asunder,
And praying for Founders shall pass away,
And holy Writs shall show us what to say,
The Churches where Images were wonten to be set,
With lively Letters they shall be writ,
To many men's hearts as heavy as lead,
Both young and old may them read,
But God of his Pre-eminence, and of his high Throne,
All honor shall be to him alone;
Foxes shall fall, and rights shall appear,
And thus it shall continue from year, to year,
But at the last, a wonder to tell,
There shall be stirred strife, with many a battle,
For a double danger shall be the cause,
For often changing, and breaking of Laws,
The other if you read arights,
The loss of Lords, Kings, and Knights;
For woe worth the time, and woe worth the sorrow,
Mischief dates end, it shall be no borrow;
A Maiden in tower shall have in hand,
To rule, and govern this her Island;
Her Lords by righteousness rule shall she,
At length of her great Realm discharged she shall be,
For Barons, and Lords a promise shall make,
Of Gods Holy Word a part to take,
But Prelates in pride their lust to fulfill,
Shall cause thereby, much mischeife, and ill,
Which may sley both Priest, and Clarke,
They never heard such a piece of warke,
For happy shall be be then, which is too true,
That bids England farewell, and adue,
For sorrows shall come, both to high, and low,
How one shall trust another none shall know,
For then Ladies with sorrows shall sing,
Widows and Maids their hands shall wring,
Children at their paps, shall die in the street,
All kind of creatures shall mourn or weep,
Woe and alas then may be said,
All kind of pastimes down shall be laid,
Then Castles, and Towns, and pleasant buildings,
Shall be destroyed, and come to their endings,
For who so be in bed over night,
Next morning shall be pressed to fight,
Then great sorrow, hunger, and pain,
To eat dead folks, they shall be feign,
Woe worth the sin that this cause shall be
To cause God thus to show his cruelty,
But a voice shall come both night and day,
Crying to Heaven to call you away;
But sorrow, and pain for our offenses,
With battle, famine, and pestilences,
As a dissolved Land brought shall it be,
Who knows more none but he,
Then a peace there shall be pretended,
That peace may be dissembled,
That peace may be removed,
That peace will folly be proved,
But now greater sights will appear,
great Mars omnipotent
will be very diligent,
His bloody brands of steel to whet upon their side,
that we shall them deride.
This Mars with cruel fauction with Nation utter ruin,
that all England situation, shall be with oppression,
and still read on their passion.
Flaunders shall rise with France,
with Spear, Shield, Bill and Lance,
to fight a double dance,
confedered with alliance,
to offer the defiance,
Spain shall employ the Britains to annoy,
the Scots us to destroy,
the Welchmen to annoy,
the Dane to pluck and pull,
And all this resurrection,
shall put to their full section,
to bring thee to destruction,
England take this admonition,
Be wise and change thy condition,
Doubt not but think it sure
This storm thou shall endure,
With heart confess thee,
And to Heaven adresse thee
For English name shall clear away
Out of this Land for ever and aye,
When Rome is removed into England,
And every Priest the Popes power shall have in hand,
Betwixt six, and three (as I understand)
The Battle shall be in Britain Land.
When pride is most pressed, and lechery most rife, and Knights and knaves clad
both in one clothing the Church awlesse, and the Land lawless, by the year of
Christ to come and gone,
In the Land of Albion shall be much confusion.
Courtiers shall be taxed, and great buffets have with flattering and fearing
their Prince they please, and against the Law they shall rove, and cause the
Commons to be at great discord.
A dreadful Dragon with a red rose of great fame,
A bastard in wedlock borne shall be
The Crown to obtain, shall challenge by name,
Tunc veniet puer vbi nomen ille.
The shortest and longest night, that shall be found in all the whole year,
There shall be challenging to fight, great defeace to see and hear;
Penticost night shall be clothed in white in token of lightning,
For to be at Candlemas when torches be light, a new morning for to be,
Afterward carried out of the North, and for to meet at Ravenspurgh,
S. and P. shall stand in Cosfield haven till such time as the keeper of the
Crown
Shall die upon his brothers sword point, then shall all be turned upside down;
Then a Lion come out of the West, in harness to stir them for to cease,
But there shall be no manner of rest, until twenty hundred steeds run
masterlesse away,
A wet Summer before this shall be;
Thus guessed Humphry Tindale Vicar of Wellenger of his prophesy.
FINIS.
