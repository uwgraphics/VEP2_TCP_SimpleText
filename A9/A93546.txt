A Speech spoken by the right Honorable William Lord Marquess of Hartford, in
the Councell-Chamber at OXFORD.
May it please Your Majesty,
MY long absence from this honorable Board, of which by Your Majesty's favor
I am a member, may privilege me to beg license for a few words: wherein I
shall freely deliver to Your Majesty and these Lords, my opinion concerning
the present affairs of this Your distracted and dis-jointed Kingdom; which is
so far out of frame and order, by the occasion of these long continued civil
wars, that it has need (and very urgent need too it is) of all the means that
can be used to rectify and bring it into its old state and condition. Your
Majesty and these Lords all know, with what integrity I have engaged my self
and fortunes in Your Majesty's service, and in it I did discharge the duty I
was bound in to Your royal Majesty: But as much as I can with my best
judgment gather in all my progress about several parts of this Kingdom,
during the process of these wars, it had been far better they had never been
begun at all; or since heaven for the sins of this land has suffered them to
be begun, it were (in my poor opinion) extremely requisite, for the safety and
tranquillity of Your Majesty, and of all us Your Subjects, that they were
speedily ended; they being justly to be resembled to a violent disease, which
if it be in the beginning of it resisted with wholesome medicines, may be
overcome; if permitted to run too long, is hardly or not at all curable. For
first, if we respect the conditions and affections of the people, especially
those whom I have conversed with in Wales and elsewhere, we shall find them
very difficult to undertake Your Majesty's quarrel against the high Court of
Parliament, the very name whereof is so firmly and with that reverence rooted
in the breasts of the English Nation, nay in the hearts of the very mountainers
of Wales, that with a determined faith they believe and so far, as they dare
affirm that the Parliament is in the right, that Your Majesty is misled and
ill counseled against the Parliaments proceedings, which have always been so
happy to the Kings of this Realm Your ancestors: and with an infallible
confidence they protest they can never be drawn willingly to take up arms
against those honorable and faithful men, that were by their own choice
elected and appointed to look after the affairs of the Kingdom, to treat in
Council for the amendment of the disorders of the Commonwealth, which before
this present Session of Parliament were grown up to a formidable and oppressive
number, to the great prejudice of the liberty and property of the Subject. So
that those few men which I have been able to draw in those parts to your
Majesty's service are for the most part men of mean fortunes, and such too in
whom we may or can repose no great confidence, since they may be imagined to
come to these wars rather for fear then affection, and where men come to
employ their hands against their hearts there can be expected no great
expression of courage, much less of fidelity. For moneys (so please Your
Majesty) I must really inform You, that in all those parts where I have been
conversant there is little or none at all to be procured, at least for Your
Majesty's assistance: The Gentry and people of fashion cry out, they cannot
possibly part with that which they have not, their stores being quite exhausted
by former payments: and if some of them for fear (whom we were sure had money)
were won to part with some small pittance out of it, they as soon as their
backs were turned from us, with much murmur exclaimed, that their money was
extorted and borrowed from them by force; that to prevent taking away the whole
they were glad to forgo part of their estates. So that by these expressions
your Majesty and these Lords may plainly perceive which way the game will go,
when Your necessities shall compel Your Highness to stand in most need of
assistance or supply from their bounties. Besides, an exceeding murmur is rife
in every man's mouth in Wales and the borders thereof, that Your Majesty
(contrary to Your expressions and Declararations) does entertain daily great
store of convicted Popish Recusants into Your service, as they instance in my
Lord Herbert, son to the Earl of Worcester, whose Forces are compounded almost
altogether of such public Delinquents, enemies to the true Protestant
Religion: And the name of Papist is so execrably odious to the People in
general, for their former treacherous practices against the State and
Religion, that they do confidently now believe, since such men are permitted
to fight under your Majesty's Ensigns, that they are displayed merely for the
ruin and subversion of their liberties; that those malevolents to Gods true
Religion, must needs be drawn together, to overthrow the true and sincere
profession of it in your Majesty's Dominions, and so possessed with these
fears, which (considering the persons) are not altogether vain or causeless,
they suggest to themselves a thousand strange chimeraes of dangers, all which,
their imagination leads them to believe, are derivative from your Majesty and
your Counselors, that permit the public foes to Religion and the
Commonwealth to be armed, pay, put swords into their desperate and ill
governed hands.

Nor are these all the inconveniences or disadvantages that my observation has
assured me must wait upon your Majesty in the continuance of these wars (if
we should be so unhappy as to see them continue) your Majesty's forces are
daily impaired and diminished, without any hopes of supplies, unless it were
possible the arteries of your slaughtered soldiers could again take life, and
rise up to your Majesty's service; the Parliaments army on the contrary side
being certain to be reinforced with fresh men whenever any of the old ones
fall, either by the hand of war or sickness, the whole Kingdom being, as it
were, at their devotion, all the able men thereof running with willing hearts
and courageous hands, to sacrifice their lives in the Parliaments quarrel,
which they conceive to be the common quarrel of the Kingdom, the quarrel for
their wives and children, estates and liberties.

In such a variety and labyrinth of disadvantages, walks the army now waiting
on your Majesty; and so securely the other, that by the view of their strength,
we may easily survey our own urgent infirmities. And which is of all the
accidents of this war the most to be lamented, is, that we are engaged
brothers against brothers, friends against friends, nay, parents against their
dearly beloved children, and sons against their fathers, the whole land
fraught with nothing but the horrors of war and bloodshed: true Religion in
the mean time is neglected and trampled upon; the Laws (which are the
Subjects best property, and the Sovereigns largest prerogative) being despised
and villified, and every thing changed from the calmnesse of its own genuine
condition into distraction and fury: the Parliament, which had wont to be the
ablest bulwark of the Kingdom, the Subjects security, and the Kings constant
ayder and supplement in all his necessities, rent from your Majesty, and your
Majesty separated from them; so that that supreme Council (convocated to
settle the distempers of the Commonwealth, to enact good and wholesome Laws
for the defense and advancement of the Subjects liberty) is enforced to spend
all that precious time which might and should have been employed as aforesaid,
upon the composure of these differences, and in agitating means for the Laws
and the Kingdoms defense.

We our selves, who were Peers and fellows in that honorable society, being
voted out of our places and honors; and, so please your Majesty, if your
royal self and these Lords will but seriously consider the nature and
proportion of their gains and losses in these wars, your sacred self, and
all of them shall easily find the loss to be the only thing that can be
gotten by these wars. Loss your Majesty is sure to have of your subjects,
loss in your revenue, loss in your magnificence, and the extent of your
regality being, as it were, circumscribed to this City of Oxford, and deprived
of the possession of your royal Palaces, in and about your City of London,
which would to God your Majesty had never left, and then these fatal
mischiefs had either not happened at all, or at leastwise not been of this
lasting and lamentable continuance. For my part, and so I may affirm of all
these Lords, we lose as much as we have by these wars. First, we lose our
repute with the Parliament, and consequently with the Commonwealth; we lose
the enjoyment of our estates, which are published by the Parliament forfeits to
the use of the Commonwealth; which is dearest of all to mortal men, we lose
the affection and society of all our brethren, friends and allies, diverse of
which in this quarrel are our utter enemies. But I shall transgress my duty,
and tire your Majesty with too tedious amplification of the inconveniences of
these present wars, the zeal I have to your Majesty's service, and the good of
the Commonwealth, renders me beyond my own nature, conscious of this
prolixity, whose only aim is to beseech your Majesty, for the honor you
bear to Gods cause* and for the love you carry in your royal thoughts to us
your dutiful servants, and to all your Subjects in general, to think of some
means for a sudden Accommodation of peace betwixt your self and your high
Court of Parliament: nothing can be more acceptable to God then the bringing
this peace to pass, nor more fortunate and prosperous to your people. So have
I freely, with your Majesty's license, delivered my faithful opinion and
counsel, which I shall hourly pray may suite to as good an effect as I
intended it.

FINIS.
