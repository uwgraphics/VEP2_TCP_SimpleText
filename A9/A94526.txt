TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY,
The humble Petition of many thousand Citizens of great rank and quality in
the City of Westminster: presented to his Majesty at York, May 25. 1642.
Most Humbly shows,
THat whereas your Petitioners weigh with mature consideration, the Diurnall
labors, and indefatigable pains of the Parliament for the security of this
Kingdom, notwithstanding your Majesty's long absence from them, do conceive
it to be no less heart-bleeding grief unto all your loving Subjects, then a
great discouragement unto your Parliament. For while they are wrestling with
the great disturbances, and distractions of this Kingdom, they are opposed by
new, and strange suspicions: while they are breaking the Cockatrice egg,
Wherein the envy of a malignant party is hatching, in the mean time a
prodigious Serpent of growing jealousy does arise: while they are curing the
corrupted wounds of the body with the medicable balsome of the Laws, the Head
seems to be distempered. And whereas your Petitioners understanding, that
your Majesty's continuance at York, will be both disadvantageous to your own
Royal person and preiuditiall to the Epidemicall welfare of this whole
Kingdom, and that your Majesty's intention to take Hull, would not have been
more secure, then to have taken Whit hall, and that your Majesty's supposed
resolution to take Arms against the Parliament (which struck amazement it
self amazed) was so derogatory from the heart of a Prince, and so opposite to
the Laws of the Land, that (your Petitioners must impartially confess) that
they could searce entertain any such suspicion in their minds, having greater
confidence in you their Sovereign, and in your Majesty's more sollicitous care
for the public peace and welfare of your Kingdoms, which by the Law of God,
and man you are to maintain; In the revolution of all which premises your
Petitioners hearts have been deeply wounded with pationate grief, and the
ambiguous fear of imminent danger; Wherefore your Petitioners seriously
considering the manifold dangers inpendent to this Kingdom, and all flowing
from one general fountain in your Majesty's absence, do with all submission
of heart, and ardency of affection, humbly beseech your Sacred Majesty
graciously to vouchsafe to return to your Parliament, to the accomplishment of
the future peace, and safety of the Kingdom, wherein your Petitioners do
acknowledge themselves, and their Posterity to be involved. And withal your
Petitioners do obsequiously implore your Majesty to concur, and comply with
your Parliament, and correspond with them in all their consultations by the
blessed connection of love, that so both all fears, and suspicions, all
griefs, and molestation, which has long poisoned their hearts in your
absence, may be forthwith expelled with the happy Antidote of you Royal
presence.

In humble supplication to your Majesty, we likewise desire that you would
graciously condescend to the disposal of the Militia of the Kingdom, as the
Parliament have already judiciously ordered and appointed: That so we may be
Armed in preparation to mitigate any domesticke Insurrection or Mutany, and
able to withstand the oppositions of any foraigne enemy whatsoever: That your
Majesty would not altogether forget the bloody continuance of the Rebellion in
Ireland, and their still persecution of the British Nation, but that greater
aid and assistance may be speedily sent; And that the fountain of Religion
may flow in a more sanctified, and purer current, to the absolute extirpation
of Popery and Superstition, Heretical faction, and Schism, and to the pious
reformation of the Church of England: But most especially, what the Alpha, and
Omega of our Prayers intimates, is, That your Majesty would be graciously
pleased to return suddenly to the Parliament, and be conjoined to them in a
reciprocal, and coherent unity, and then the perfection of our wishes shall
be consummated, while your Petitioners will maintain and secure your sacred
Majesty from any unjust injury to the utmost of their lives, fortunes,
estates, and liberties.

And for your Majesty's happy return, your Petitioners as in all Loyalty and
Obedience bound, shall for ever pray, etc.
