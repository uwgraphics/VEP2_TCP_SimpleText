Your Honors i^^ the service of the Lord Jesus Christ: JOHN WELLS

To the READER.
READER:
EXpect not that I should say much, the tract it self speaks but little,
though it speak of great things, if thou enquire why the Author shows
himself in the press: I can tell thee, it is out of a desire to do thee good in
print. The matter and subject I know is very seasonable in these evil times
for a good soul to chew upon, that I dare commend unto thee: for the manner of
the handling of it I will say but this, it is according to the talent God has
lent me: If thou gain any light, any growth, any comfort, any quickening in thy
faith; bless God; and think of me, as one, that has obtained mercy at the
hands of Jesus Christ: and as one, that (were he not compast about with such a
weight of infirmities, he would do (through the grace of Christ) most exactly
as he writes. Reader, say what thou will of me, but be sure to speak well of
God of Christ, of his love, of his promises: be ashamed to sown, sink, or
fall, when God, when Christ, puts under so many hands to keep thee up: Live in
God, thou will live no where else: Stay thy self upon this Rock, who purposes
to be such a sure one to ^^ee: Let not thine ears al^aies be filled with the sad
out^^ies, and doleful clamours of ^ood and misery: turn thy ^^res toward
God, listen what (...) says: the voice of misery ^^ings us to bemoan our
selves; (...) to cry, alas what shall we do? ^^ut the voice of the Merciful
^oughts of our God speaks to ^^ch Saint as the Angels to Mary, Why weepest
thou? Or (...) our Savior to that woman, ^e healed of a bloody issue, Ioh.
20.13 Luke 8.48. (...) Ferendum and sperandu^ est: We must bear and yet be

Mercies-Thoughts, For the Vessels of Mercy under Misery.
JEREM. 29.11. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the
Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.


THe words are a piece of a Letter sent from Jerusalem, by the Prophet
Jeremiah, to the Jews, both Elders, Priests and Prophets, all captivated in
Babylon: the same God, that to fallen man vouchsafed to send his scriptures, he
is pleased now by his Prophet to send a Letter to his poor fallen, broken,
people of the Jews: he that permitted them to be in the darkness of
Captivity, could not endure to see them in the darkness of sin: they shall
have light sent after them, though they were removed out of Canaan; our God may
as soon cease to love himself, as cease to bring forth love tokens from
himself, to, and for his people, though in sad afflictions: His people were
now in Babylon, yet they shall be differenced from the Heathens of Babylon.
They may live together in the same place, they shall not enjoy the same mercy:
God will have the desolate Jews written to, whilst the flourishing Babylonians
shall be overlookt: Gods people when they be at worst, at lowest, enjoy such
privileges, as the Wicked Babylonians when they be at highest shall not so
much as taste of. Our God is love, but it is to his own: 1 John. 4.16. Deus noster
in relatione ad fideles est mer^ charitas, sic enim intelligenda est illa
Phrasis, and non de Deo absolute considerato. Ames. de Cons. cas.
toward the world of the wicked ^e is a consuming fire.

This letter was occasioned by ^he dreams, and the lies of the ^lse prophets,
who speaking to ^is captivated people, did go about to deceive them in re^ect
of the continuance of their Captivity, they prophecy lies, ^^d dream dreams
in the ^ame of the Lord, telling them ^^ey should not be long in Babylon: This
is cleared: First by ^^e very voice of the false pro^hets, which was this,
within ^wo full years (says Hananiah ^penly, and it was the vote of all ^he
other false Prophets) Says ^^e Lord of Hosts the God of ^srael, will I bring
again into this (...) lace all the vessels of the Lords House etc. for I will
break the ^oke of the King of Babylon, Ier. (...) 8 1.5.

Secondly, it is cleared, that this was the drift of the false prophets by
Ierimiahs own letter, that he sends to them: and that these particulars
touching the letter will easily discover. First the prophets Charge to the Jews
in Babylon of building houses and dwelling in them; Ier. 29.4, 8.
o^ planting gardens and eating the fruit of them: of taking wive^ and
begetting sons and daughters: of taking wives to their sons: of giving their
daughters t^ husbands, that they may beasons, and daughters: of seeking the
peace of the City, when they were captives; and praying for it, in all which he
give them to know, that their captivity should not be so so soon ended, but it
should last long and they took it so, 28. v.
for thus i^ their writing back to the people and priests at Jerusalem they
testify that Ieremia had se^ unto them in Babylon, saying the captivity was
long, build y^^ houses, etc. Oh this stung them that the prophet Jeremiah
should flatly contradict their false prophets; that he should cry down, what
they cried up; and and so give them the lie:

Secondly, the Prophets caution, 8. and 9.
he gives them warning (from the mouth of the Lord) saying let not your
prophets and your diviners (they be yours, they be none of mine, says God)
that be in the midst of you, deceive you, etc. for they prophecy fa^sly unto
you in my name: I have not sent them says the Lord: no disciaifie, them, he
tells them, by this, thus much plainly, they do not say as I say; they be of
another mind, concerning your captivity, then I am.

says not after two years, but after 70. wherein the Lord proclaims thus
much, that their false prophets knew not his mind, spoke not his will, declared
not his Message, but all was from their own hearts.

Fourthly, Ier. 25.30.
because Jeremiah must be reproved, stockt, and imprisoned for sending such a
message to them in Babylon, this is Shemajabs will, and the rest in captivity,
sent in writing to the people and priests at Jerusalem, especially to Zephaniah
the priest. Truth will not down with them that are given to lies: this is an
hard saying, John 6.60 Doctrina vora est carni a mara aegreque digeritur.
who can hear it: it was spoken of his doctrine, who spoke, as never man spoke.

By this time we may easily see what put Jeremiah upon writing to the Jews in
Babylon: their Prophets deceived them concerning the time of their Captivity,
and he writes to undeceive them again, (if it were possible) true Prophets
will take any pains, use any good means, to preserve a people from erring or
to recall them from their wanderings; Ieremiahs zeal will not let him rest to
see a people (though now in Babylon) to mis-carry.

First, observe; These false Prophets deceived them before they were in
captivity and now they do no better: times and troubles will not mend false
Prophets, they can find the way to lie in Babylon as well as in Judaea Coelu^
non animum mutant. They are in another Country, but not of another mind:
Surely these were resolved concerning lying, as he was concerning
Philosophying, (...).
who said he would never cease as long as he lived.

2 Israel was now in captivity, yet he was ready to be carried away from God
still: nay more, they themselves caused the dreams of the false Pr^phets to be
dreamed, as its said, verse. 8. Corrupt man can easily be naught be deceived, be
carried away from God, yea run after lies even under the afflicting hand o^ God.

3 These false Prophets ha^ caused them to err, and so lea^ them into
captivity; yet they have not done Israel harm enough; they will spoil them
farther in their afflictions: Satan's instruments are ever working, till they
have fully and utterly cast away a people: they will not leave their work a^
halves; and should Gods instruments do so then?

4 These false prophets could no^ but see (one would think) tha^ they had
spoken lies, in speaking of peace, before the war, the judgment, the
captivity cam^ to this people: the Lord had by his divine hand of justice
give^ them the lie; yet these will o^ in their lying trade; and put o^ a bold
and impudent face on i^ too: the Devil himself may (...) soon put off himself,
his lying nature, and lie not; as corrupt man can (of himself) cease from that
sin: even in this regard they may be well styled (...), Di^els they are, 2 Timothy
3.3.
not only in their falsenesse of accusing, but of deceiving and lying.

5 These false Prophets, no que^tion, were in some danger of ^osing their
lives, when the Enemy came so terribly against Je^usalem; yet they are
preserved ^hilst better then themselves are taken off: God has his own ^imes
for the judging of Wicked ^en: they shall escape and live, ^^ill he sees them
fully ripe for judgment, and then woe unto them: these shall dye in Babylon,
though they fall not in Judaea: ^hese are not so much preserved, ^s reserved.

6 Israel had suffered much by ^earkening to these false Prophets: Gods
judgments were ^ut, they were now in captivity; yet these false Prophets are
still loved, and the people are eager to follow them: Ungodly men once
bewitched by fal^^ Prophets, they will after them though they drink nothing but
damage by them: they will stick to them, though they dy^ with them, and by
them, by their poison, dreams, deceits.

The occasion of the words i^ clear, and being so, it gives ligh^ enough to the
drift of the spiri^^ it shows what is aimed at in the Text, and in 4. verses
more (...) namely from the 10. to the 15.

First, the Spirit of God by Jeremiah goes about to pro^^ their Prophets Liars,
of whom they said the Lord had raised them up Prophets in Babylo^^ and that in
a glorying way too verse. 15. However an ungodly seduced people will highly
advance and foolishly ex^oll their seducers; yet God he give them their own,
and will disown those of whom they blindly brag that God had sent them God
loves not that false Prophets should get them a name by false titles, or win
authority from the hearts of others by ^are pretense, of Gods sending them.

2 For the Comforting of those, that were willing to hear^en to God, who, when
they ^ad heard all these false Prophets with one consent, even after two
years, the yoke of ^he King of Babylon should be ^roken, and the Captivity
over, were ready to enquire with the ^ood King, (as being altogether
unsatisfied, and not perwaded, that what they spoke was truth) is their not a
Pro^het more? Jeremiah he comes (...), and tells these, that this is the Word of
the Lord, after 70 years (...) not after two, or a few, that ^as false) be
accomplished, at Ba^^lon he would visit them, and ^erforme his good word toward
^^em, and cause them to return (...) Jerusalem: and was not this a sweet word
too? the Lord himself tells them their captiv^^ shall end, though he is
determined for a longer time then t^^ false Prophets talked off.

These five verses point (...) these four special things: whe^^ in we may see
the very s^^stance and marrow of them.

1 That God would not ce^tainly put an end to their C^^tivity, after seventie
years (...) would visit them to purpo^^ he would so come, that th^^ captivity
should not stay: (...) would draw out his good w^^ of deliverance into act, and
(...) promise should fall into a ble^^^ Performance.

2 The proof of this endi^^ of their captivity, in this (...) verse, and it is
drawn fr^^ Gods thoughts and determi^^tions to do such a thing for (...)
people, he has pitched upon (...) and who can alter him?

3 The means which (...) will have his people use, to (...) delivered by: the
instances in one, and that is prayer, earnest prayer, continued prayer, prayer,
that should hold out, till the thing prayed for be obtained: then (says God in
the 12.13 verse. shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and
ye shall seek me, and search for me, with all your heart: then, that is, when
this 70 years be even out, and the time of the fulfilling of the promise
draws ^igh, this shall be a praying time with them: now their hearts shall be
hot for deliverance, ^ow their spirit shall hunger to be out of captivity, more
then ordinary: now they shall call upon God, nay they shall take pains to do
it, they shall go and ^ray, they shall flock together to pray, they shall go
to heaven by faith, and pray as they that are both restless without this
mercy, and also confident that God would give ^t them: nay they shall seek,
and search after God, with (...) their hearts: none but God w^^ serve their
turn now: they wi^^ have none of Idols: they wi^^ not seek themselves most i^
their prayers, but God mo^^ they will now search after Pr^mises and Gods time
(as Dan^^ did in this case Cap. 9. beg^ their hearts now begin to e^quire after
God, and to ask where is he? How may we fi^^ him? what is it, the parts b^twixt
us and him? now th^^ search after him for communi^^ with him and blessed
enjo^ment of him: here is prayer, a^^ diligence, and self denial, a^^ love and
confidence, and co^stancy of Spirit toward G^^ all meeting in one, all
togeth^^ in these poor souls, now t^^ time of their delivery drew ^neer: the
most wise God th^^ fits his means, his ends m^^ sweetly together, he makes
th^^ to be when he stirs in th^^ hearts at his season, and ro^^ ^^owses up a
dull people, to look after him, for their promised de^iverance: when the
spiritual and blessed means of the Saints ^eliverances are once set on foot
^y the Spirit of God, in the ^eart of his people, insomuch that faith goes out
much and prayer is held up without ceas^ng, and there is great search a^^er
God, know ye that their di^iverance is very near it is even ^t the doors: the
Jews Captivity ^asts not, it is soon off when once they do thus bestir
themselves at Gods throne, misery ^anot stand up long against prayers, it will
vanish like a mist before the Sun: Then, and not ^ill then will deliverance
appear, then and no longer, will God stay, but Salvation shall ^ome unto them.

4. The prevailing of this means, it shall do the deed: God will answer them,
his loving ^eart will pity them, his Gra^ious hand will work for them: this
the spirit delivers in the 12.13, and 14. verses, and h^ speaks it thrice for
failing, h^ will be sure to speak full in the thing: I will hearken unto you
(says God) now they shall have the listening ear of God^ he hears and observes
now^ what they say, as one glad t^ hear them make such request^^ to him: they
shall find me (sai^^ God) I will not hide my self from them now: they shall
find^ me in my mercy, find me in (...) might, find me in my wisdom find
mein my countenance, the^ shall find me to be for the^ to save, to comfort
them: I wi^^ be found of you, says the Lord and will turn away your
Captivity, etc. This is a finding indeed, to some purpose: now the Lord would
be seen in answering them, they should find him, and he would be found (...)
them: that is, look wherein and for what, they did seek ^^to him, God would
answer them, and say, behold, here am I; what is your request, it shall be
granted? You shall have to the full what you beg for, and so desire to have:
however heretofore I have hid my face from you, now I intend to appear for you:
you shall see me again to your joy, you shall find me again to your full
content: What can God say more? how can he speak sweeter and more to the heart
of his people then thus.

In this verse the Lord brings proof of what he had spoken before, concerning
his recovering Israel out of Captivity at the 70. years end: wherein we may
see the Lord guiding of his Saints even to know the great deep of his own
purpose, as touching their coming out of Babylon: his purpose indeed was
revealed in his promise, made in the former verse, but this will not suffice
the Lord to say, I will visit you, I will cause you to return to this place;
but he will give in ground for it: for I know the thoughts that I think toward
you, etc. We seldom read of a promise thus backed: usually God delivers his
promises without such a bottom as this: when God told Abraham he would be his
God, and the God of his seed: Genesis 17 7, 8.
he gives no such reason there as this; he does not say for I know my thoughts
toward thee Abraham: I remember not in all the Scripture the like instance,
that God should give a reason, and such a reason as this, why he would visit
his people with love, with salvation. Certainly there is somewhat in it more
then ordinary, it is not because Gods bare word of promise is not sufficient
for the faith of his people: neither is it because God would now cherish or
satisfy any curiosity o^ niceness, that might be in the hearts of his
people, touching prying into his own secrets (...) but God does this most
freely and lovingly; it is his mercy to his people, that makes him give in this
overplus to his promise, and heaps up to them this great measure, good,
pressed down, and running over into their bosoms. The Lord does this,

1 Because he would the more affront, beat down, and show himself openly and
directly against those lying Prophets, who did belie the Lord, and tell the
people, that this was not Gods mind, that they should stay so long in
captivity, but the Lords thoughts, his mind was for two years only: it is for
more (says God) I know my thoughts, they do not: believe me, not them.

2 Because he would the more ascertain the thing in the eyes and to the hearts
of his people, he brings in an evidence most clear, and that which none else
was able to produce: my thoughts have pitched upon your release, your
deliverance, this I am sure of, says God, for I know the^ do not doubt my
people of you returning back, because you a^^ to abide in Babylon so long, an^
to build and plant there, at su^^ a time I will visit you, believe i^ I have
already concluded upon it, my thoughts are immovable set upon your release;
therefore what ever mountains be in the way, believe, they shall be di^^ down,
rather then their standing shall hinder the accomplishment of my will in this
thing: G^^ shows them here not only (...) promise of salvation under h^^
broad Seal (thus says the Lord but he shows them his very heart and mind,
even the very original and root of the thing and says, thus the Lord think^
thus he purposes toward you did God ever lay open his heart his counsels more?
Did he eve^ more sweetly go to work, t^ prop up the weak faith of hi^ people,
or to stop the mouthe^ of his Enemies, that they might be silent, and leave
objecting.

1 Says God, you shall come out then, for my thoughts are already pitched upon
it, my purposes are for it, and who can alter them?

2 You shall come out then, says God, for my thoughts be toward you, they be
loving, they be full of mercy, they be not against you for evil, they be for
you for good: I love your souls, your persons, your bodies, your peace; you
have my thoughts, my intentions, my considerations at work for you.

3 Says God, you shall come out then, for my thoughts be peaceable and
bountiful thoughts, thoughts of peace, thoughts to give, and to give you an
accepted end: They be not thoughts of will, of pain, of trouble, of adversity:
I think not how to do you an ill turn, how to watch over you for evil; but
how to give, and to give you somewhat that shall be worth receiving, an happy
end of your troubles: to give you that which you so much, so earnestly expect,
an end, and epxectation, both a^ once: you shall have such an end, as you
desire, expect, wish for^ wait for.

4 You shall come out the^ says God, for I know my thoughts are thus toward
you: thus peaceable, thus merciful, thus bountifuull, thus to give, thus to
reward, thus to let you have double, twice as much mercy as ever you had: the
thoughts I have toward you I can easily understand, clearly see, quickly read
them every one: it is impossible for meeither to be unacquainted with my own
vows, with the holy movings of my own mind; or not to approve of my own
thoughts: I cannot either be ignorant of them, or deceived by them: you men
think you know not what sometimes, your thoughts be gone from you as
Nebuchdnezzars dream was gone from him, he could not tell it, no more can ye
many times, but I know every thought of my heart, every motion of my mind? My
thoughts (says God) as they be neither vain, nor light in themselves, so they
be not dark to me: I fully know who I pitch upon, to what end, upon what
grounds: they be not thoughts against, my will, such as I cannot consent to:
the Motions of my heart, as they are guided by the perfection of my Wisdom,
so are they filled with the strength of my affection, of my love: I know my
thoughts toward you: I love you, therefore do I mule, cast in mind, purpose
for your good: and these purposes, these thoughs are also dear unto me, as the
issues of mine own love.

This text speaks thus much, even the blessed language of the tender bowels of
God toward his own, it holds forth m^^^ sweetly the tender thoughts (...) the
merciful God toward hi^ people in evil times: here are the thoughts of God,
set out to open view, in a most lovely way, they are set out to life, and
bespangled with most rare and precious Jewels. God has thoughts, thoughs of
his own thoughts, that he knows, thoughts toward his people, that way their
faces look, thoughts of peace, not of troubles: thoughts to give, not to take
away: thoughts to give out a full good, mercy, full big enough for their
expectation: thoughts of seasonable, speedy, and welcome mercy, to give his an
expected end.

These words we might branch forth particularly, and then, see what fruit every
branch would bear: but we will not take them in sunder: that which we will do,
is, to gather thus much in the gross, as the maine that lies in the text,
under which most of the particulars will kindly come in, and it is thus much.

That our God, Doct.
even when his people be in an evil condition under sore pressures, has
precious purposes full of mercy and good toward them, busy and thinking
thoughts to give out that deliverance and Salvation, his people stand in need
of: or thus: Our God has his thoughts of mercy for vessels of mercy under
misery; Micah. 4.9, 13.
when Zion was in Pangs and cried out, when Israel was in Babylon, when she
dwelt in the fields when she was in the enemies hand, when many nations were
gathered against her to undo her, and longed to see her defiled that their eye
might look upon Zion: God pesently comes in and gives a cooler to the
malicious flame of the enemy: but they know not the thoughts of the Lord,
neither understand they his council: those poor creatures bloody enemies to
Gods People, they knew not how God did think, did devise or purpose, either for
his people o^ against them: what his intentions were, and his purposes in
letting them run on in their malice against his, they looked not at; they knew
not at what God did drive in all their projects against Zion: this wholly takes
them up, how to vnd^ Zion, how to trample her in the dirt: but this takes up
Gods thoughts, how to deliver, to save his, and to pay them.

When a poor soul is in Spiritual distresses, and cannot be persuaded that
God will pardon him, and yet he forsakes his wicked way, and his unrighteous
thoughts (either concerning his own righteousness, as if that would stead him
for his justification: or concerning the righteousness of Christ, as if either
it could not be his, or being his it could not be enough, Isa. 55.7, 8, 9.
and returns to the Lord, and resolves to get the Mercy of God in Christ for a
pardon; But yet still he is beaten back, and knocked down with unbe^eeving
thoughts, and harpes upon this string, I cannot think I shall be pardoned: it
will not enter into my heart yet, it will not sound well with me: Oh says God
of such a one, My thoughts are not like that man's thoughts: He thinks he shall
not be pardoned, my purpose is, he shall: His thoughts are, it is impossible,
mine are; it is easy for me, not only to pardon, but abundantly to parden, to
multibly pardon: his thoughts be ^ow, and base, concerning me: mine be high,
and such as become my self, such as suits with the very nature of a merciful
God: How can God speak more in a few words, to show what his thoughts be
toward a distressed conscience? How does God strive with a poor sin to
bring him out of the snare?

1. He tells him, that he think thoughts against his thoughts and beyond the
poor creature apprehension.

2 He tells the poor broke heart what his whole mind is and what he conceives
toward him in his own bowels.

3 He tells him he must no^ compare his thoughts, wit^ Gods, being there is no
proportion betwixt them; and withal swetly imployes, that he takes (...) as an
infinite disparagement, (...) put his bowels and his thought in the same
balance with man^ as is if there were no such difference, but they might be we
weighed together.

4 He tells him in and by a^ this, the sweetness of his own purposes, the
graciousnesse of h^ own bowels, the unspeakeable tenderness of his heart,
that cannot look on and see a poo^ soul miserable, and yet say nothing, or do
nothing; but he must, he will come in for the rescue; God here speaks of his
thoughts so highly, to kill the thoughts of a poor creature, which were ready
to kill him: the wound was made, is kept fore and widened, by man's own
thoughts: God comes with his thougts, to heal him: ^e sets thoughts against
thoughts, to set man free: God ^ere has a great disease in hand, when he
brings in his own thoughts and purposes, for a ^ure of it: and yet this will
our God do, this secret concerning his own good pleasure will God make known,
rather then see a brokenhearted sinner perish, or pass his days without the
secret or sollid comfort of the Almighty. Hence the faithful soul is a
proclaiming this so freely, after he was brought out of an horrible pit, after
his feet were set upon a Rock, when his soul was strengthened, Psalm. 40.
and his goings established: Psalm. 40.2, 5.
many (says he, and he spakes it, as one wonderfully admiring it) O Lord my
God are thy wonderful worke^ which thou have don, and thy thoughts which are
to us ward, they cannot be reckned up i^ order to thee: if I would declare and
speak of them, they a^^ more then can be numbered, a^ if the soul should say,
what purposes of good had thou toward us, when we were in the mire and clay?
how many thoughts of Good: and how fruitful and effectual have tho^^ thoughts
been, which have brought out so many wonder full works, for our peace, f^^ our
comfort, for our salvation. Oh those thoughts of God (...) these the poor
soul eyes (...) these take up the heart of a believer: how precious are thy
thoughts unto me, O God: how great is the sum of them? if I would count them,
they are more in number then the sand: David's soul did most highly honor
these thoughts of God: Psalm. 139.17.18. (...) Precious Glorious
Oh they were most honorable and glorious in his eyes: of great value, very
sumptuous and stately; he looks upon them with more admiration then ever the
disciples did upon the building of the temple: they cry master, what Godly
stones be here? David cries, O how precious are thy thought O God unto me?
there were three things especially that made David so wonder at these thoughts.

1 In that they were so precious in themselves:

2 So many in their number, the grains of sand upon the Seashore, were not so
many, and all these so precious too:

3 In that all these many precious thoughts of God were so to him toward him,
and for him: there was not one thought amongst all these numerous, yea
numerable thoughts of God that was against him, that was for his hurt, of which
David could say, he was the worse f^^ all these thoughts, thine in David's eye,
are pleasant to David heart, and all bring profit in (...) David's spirit. David
could (...) could not express what the were to him: what they did f^ him; and
therefore he deliver it thus, How precious are t^ thoughts.

In the farther handling of the truth, for the better order, (...) the more
fruit, we must explain the terms in the Text.

2 Bring in the argument rationally to prove the conclu^^ on or Doctrine
observed.

3 Gather up the special Use that arise thence for our spirit^^ learning, and
blessed advantage.

First, for the terms in (...) Text: those that are to be (...) foulded are
these four.

1 What Gods thoughts are. 1 Peaceable thoughts, thoughts of peace. 2 How these
said to be toward his people. 2 Pure thoughts, thoughts of mere mercy, not of
evil. 3 How God is said to know these thoughts of his. 3 Bountiful thoughts,
thoughts, to give. 4 What these thoughts of God pitch upon in regrard of the
people, and these are 4 Satisfying thoughts, thoughts to give an end and
expectation to.

In the laying open of all these we shall see the goodlinesse, the glory of
all these thoughts of our God, how precious they are, as being Gods own
thoughts, as being thoughts toward Gods own people alone: as being so known
and approved of by God himself, that cannot be deceived, that tryes out upon
man's thoughts ^ow vain they be: Precious thoughts, as bearing for^ such
precious fruit of peace, (...) bounty, of satisfaction unto h^^ poor
servants, so that they sha^^ say, they have enough by the time God has brought
for^ all his thoughts of mercy, and put them forth into act for them.

For the first term, what do^^ God mean, when he says, the thoughts I
think: how is God said to think thoughts? T^ this we answer,

First, we must not imagi^^ God thinks thoughts as m^^ does: For,

1. The thoughts of man (...) succescive, he being a finite creature, he
thinks of one thing after another, so as he has ne^ thoughts come into his
hea^ that he never had before, and (...) thoughts increase daily: God thinks
not so, all his thought are at once, they receive no addition by time, or by
the appre^^ hensions of new objects, or (...) any occasion whatever. Gods
thoughts were ever as full as they be now, were ever the same and will be so
still without any ^^teration.

Secondly, man's thoughts be ^^allow: 1 Cor. 2.10. (...). The profundities,
heighths, depths.
he cannot reach high ^^ings: there be deep things of ^^od that he cannot dive
into: (...) an cannot think what glory (...): what it is to be in heaven: that
it is to see God face to ^^ce: there be deep things of the ^^ospel which
teaches the only ^ay to glory which are hidden (...) him: he cannot tell how
to ^^d out this narrow way that ^^ds to life, he thinks any way ^^ll serve as
well as this, and ^^at there be more ways then ^^e, to be saved by, more doors
^^en one to glory: he thinks a ^^ty will save him, or some ^^tward privilege
will stead ^^m, or some moral acts of ^^uity or mercy will do the ^^ed. There
be deep things of ^^n that he cannot behold: another man's thoughts are hidden
to him, another man's hear is as a deep Well to him, he cannot reach the
bottom, there (...) the depths of Satan: Romans 2.24. (...). Rev. 12.9.
these, man cannot discern; with these (...) can deceive the whole wor^^ he can
lead men astray, a^^ they not aware of it: he c^^ turn himself into an Angel
(...) light, and go for one too in t^^ worlds eye. Man's thoughts (...) soon
overmatcht, even as t^^ eye is quickly dazzled, beat^^ out, and blinded, by any
int^^ looking upon the clear a^^ bright body of the Sun: God thoughts can
never be so: (...) Spirit searches all things, 1 Cor. 2.10.
y^^ the deep things of God: th^^ depths, that be depths, beyond all depths, in
comparison (...) which no other deserves (...) name of a depth, these the ^^rit
searches: therefore obse^^ the Apostles gradation: he se^^ cheth all things,
yea more th^^ all things that are or be d^^ here below, more then what Satan,
sin, the world, or the heart of man can do, more then all these depths: he
searches the deep things of God, he has such a reach with him: as this ^he
spirits eye has every thing above and below in view: that which is dark
cannot be hid from him, nor that which is most bright cannot dazzle him

Thirdly, man's thoughts be ^ain, foolish, frothy, the Lord ^nows they be so:
Gods thoughts be most pure, holy, Psa. 139.17.
^ise, heavenly, glorious. David ^ould say of these, how precious ^e they? they
are thoughts, like ^^e pure streams of the fountain ^f life, thoughts that
arise from ^^e purity and holiness of the nature of God, full of beauty, ^^ey
shine with God, as it were: ^^ans thoughts be all vain, and ^^nking, as coming
from the ^^ttennesse of his own sinful ^eart, the Lord said he saw that that
ever went out of the heart of man, Genesis 6.5. (...)
all the imaginations purposes, and desires of the thoughts of his heart, they
we^^ only evil, and every day so^ he had never a good day: these evil
thoughts were not like the tertian or quartan ague, that comes now and then,
and leave^ well days betwixt: but like a^ ill and poisoned fountain tha^ sends
forth her streams continually: man's thoughts are not good now and then, and il
no^ and then, but they be ill, an^ only ill: vain, and only vai^ foolish, and
never wise, the thoughts of man are so vile, and the thoughts of God are as
glorious.

4. Man's thoughts they b^ temporal: man thinks not before he is, before he
lives, before he acts understanding: Psalm. 146.4.
and his thoughts perish when he die^ the thoughts of Gods heart and from
eternity to eternity: from Generation to Generation: the Counsel of the Lord
stands for ever: Psa. 33.11.
the thoughts of his heart to all Generations: to generation and generation (as
the Hebrew has it) never was there a Generation in the world, but Gods
thoughts were either for, or against the men of that Generation, and still all
his thoughts and his Counsels stood: they took place, what ever was thrown
down: they stood, what ever fell.

Secondly, these thoughts that God has toward his people, what are they, but
the eternal movings of Gods mind toward and for the good of his people? To
clear them yet more what they be, consider these five things touching these
thoughts of God:

1. Consider the bottom of them: this we shall find to be the infinitely
loving, gracious, and tender bowels of God: those are they that work upon God,
and make him cast in his mind, what to do for his people, whom he so loves: had
our God no bowels of love toward his, he would think no thoughts toward them.

2. The blessed issue of these movings of Gods mind: and these are his wise,
strong, gracious, immovable purposes and decrees of God, what he will most
certainly do for his people.

3. The fruits of these movings and purposes of God: these are his heavenly
care, his holy plots, his blessed devises, his divine inventions: how, by what
way and means to do his people good: 1 Pet. 5.7.
he cares for you (says Peter) and with such a care that is full and
alsufficient, so that his children need not, must not take up some, and leave
the rest to him: but they must cast all their care upon him: 2 Thessalonians. 3.16.
God gives peace to his people by all means, who is himself the Lord and
Prince of peace.

3. Deuteronomy. 32.20.
He finds his people when they be in a wilderness: he sees them, in all their
desolate conditions: their broken walls, Isa. 49.16.
their cracked estates, their broken power, is continually before their God.

4. He leads them, he takes his people by the hand in the wilderness, Deuteronomy.
32.20.
he will not suffer them to wander out of the way in their straits: these shall
be taught by him, whilst they are chastised by him: these are bettered,
whilst they are scourged.

5. He compasses them about, to be a sure defense to them, he keeps them, and
that in his own hand, and so, as the apple of his own eye.

Fourthly, there are the sweet companions of these blessed thoughts of God
toward his: As,

1. The admirable delight God takes in these thoughts of his, and in the
exercise of them: the Lord had a delight in thy fathers, Deuteronomy. 20.15.
to love them (says Moses to Israel) he took pleasure in loving Israel: in
bestowing his own mercy, he himself tasted as much sweetness in giving, as
they in receiving: if they delighted in enjoying Gods love (as well they might)
so did God himself in giving out his love; the Nurse that gives out the milk to
the child upon the breast, she finds pleasure as well as the child
nourishment. Mercy pleases him (says Micah) he wills, desires, mercy, grace;
he longs (as it were) to show his bounty; Micah. 7.18. (...) Ipse est volens de
amans desiderans benignitatem, misericordiam, gratiam. Isa. 30.18.
he waits to be gracious (says Isaiah) that Phrase implies and couches in it.
1. Gods infinite desire to be gracious: 2. His most perfect wisdom, so as, he
will not bestow his love out of season; he will stay, till he may best do it:
he will wait for the best opportunity in his eye.

2. As there is a blessed delight going along with these thoughts of God
toward his, so there is a most wise, settled, and firm constancy in these
thoughts of God toward his people: he is of one mind (says Job) who can turn
him? God is not as the son of man, that he should repent, Numb. 23.19. Job.
17.7, 11.
(says Balaam) Job complains, that al his thoughts were as a shadow; and that
his purposes were broken off, even the thoughts of his heart: Gods thoughts be
so far from being as a shadow, that they have not so much as a shadow of
turning in them, who can break off Gods purposes? who can unsettle these
thoughts of God? who can part or divide betwixt these thoughts of God, and the
people of God? who shall separate from the love of God (says the Apostle) and
may it not as well be asked, who shall separate from Gods purposes of love? not
man, nor devil; not any sin, nor any unworthiness, in the people of God. The
very nature of the blessed God must be destroyed, the very fountain of love
dried, the most quick and the tender bowels of his grace deadned, before these
purposes of God can be made unconstant that there should be yea, and nay with
them, that they should be for and against in a short space; the Apostle will
not suffer this imputation to be ca^^ upon him, 2 Cor. 1.17.
that the things h^ did purpose, he purposed according to the flesh, that with
him there should be yea, yea, and nay, nay: that he should be ( p^^ and con) as
we use to say: and will our God endure, that thi^ should lie upon him, that
the^ is yea and nay in his purposes no, no: Gods purposes hold o^ and stand,
and never vary, bu^ still show the unchangeablene^^ of that nature, from whence
they flow.

3. There are glorious aim of God, mixed as it were with these thoughts of God
toward his. As, 1. To make himself a glorious name by them: when he lead his
people out of Egypt, compast them about in the wilderness, brought them into
Canaan, the Spirit testifies, it was to make himself a glorious name, a name of
ornament, a name that might become God himself, Isai. 63.14. (...) Nomen
ornatus, gloriae, decoris.
a name of glory (faies the text) a name that might proclaim God to be the
highest, the greatest, the wisest, the fullest of mercy.

2. To give his people rest: the Spirit of the Lord caused Israel to rest
(says the same Prophet in the same place) it was a blessed rest indeed which the
Spirit of God caused: Israel was in many troubles, he went through many brakes,
but at last the Spirit of God set him down, placed him, and planted him in that
land of rest All indeed was not over in a moment, Israel must be in a wasting
and howling wilderness for a time: and all this while the Spirit lead him, and
his purposes were that Israel should rest; let his people but follow him, he
will cause Israel to rest at last: he will prepare a Land for him room for
him, a seat for him an happy possession of the Land of Canaan, and there he
shall feed and rest. Gods thought rest not in pitching upon half mercies: it is
Isreal's rest his thoughts reach unto: and what God determined, he effected by a
mighty hand, and when he saw his time, he gave Israel to sit down, and enjoy
that good Land of rest, purposed and promised long before.

Fifthly, the declaration and manifestation of these thoughts of God in their
visible fruits: When Gods thoughts come abroad, as it were, when they shine
forth in the eye of the world, when Gods decree, bring forth, when that which
lay in the womb of his purposes is born, there is a time, and a set time too,
when the Lords decree brings forth (as the Prophet Zephaniah tells us; Zeph. 2.2.
and thereupon calls upon the people of God to gather themselves together, to
seek meekness and righteousness, ere the decree brings forth, ere the day of
the Lords anger come upon them: These two the Prophet makes to be one, the
coming of the day of Gods anger, and the bringing forth of the Decree: For, as
soon as the decree of justice comes forth, the day of anger is broke, it
appears: so his purposes and thoughts of anger toward the wicked, makes anger
at length to go forth; these send forth his wrath in strokes, terrible
woundings, deadly consumings: These thoughts of wrath, break forth in the face
of God by frowns, in the hand of God by blows. Moreover, this execution of his
thoughts of justices holds proportion with his Decree, is all out as full as
his thoughts were: every blow he determins to strike, hewil strike, he will not
spare them a jot: The anger of the Lord (says Jer.) shall not return till he
has executed, Jer. 23.20.
and till he has performed the thoughts of his heart. In these Divine
purposes, God does, as it were, secretly bind himself, promise to himself, to
his own justice, so much satisfaction upon those that provoke it, according as
it requires: now God performing this to the full, and the anger of the Lord
will not return till it has executed thus far: he will never call back his
anger from the pursuit of such, until it has pursued them long enough, far
enough. So his purposes of good toward his people, they bring forth as
plentifully: look what our God promises to his own grace, to his own bowels,
that he will perform to the full: look what good he purposes concerning his
people, that, to a grain, they shall have from his gracious hand: he works
freely in a way of mercy, till he has performed the thoughts of his heart,
that is, all his thoughts toward them, till there be a thought of God toward
them, but bears his fruit, and brings it forth to them, and for them, till it
be seen that there is not a thought of God barren toward them: never shall the
purposes and thoughts of God return, till all this be done. The thoughts of
God are like Solomon's Flock of Sheep, Sol. Song 4.2.
every one bears twins, and none is barren among them: Our God who hates barren
thoughts in his people, will not, cannot have them in his own heart: his
purposes will all out in their time, and his hand will perform what he has
pitched upon in his own thoughts: if his thoughts be for deliverance of his
people, delivered they shall be, what ever opposes, these purposes of God will
carry it away, these will bear all down before them, and make a plain way even
amongst mountains, for their due and glorious performance.

The second term to be unfolded, is to have the next place, and it is this,
[The thoughts I think toward you] wherein this question must be resolved, How
and why the thoughts of God are said to be toward his people. For satisfaction
in this thing, know first, the Spirit of God means that they were thoughts of
love, of mercy, of peace, of good, as he expresses afterward: In Scripture
sense, this word [towards] when it is referred to Gods will, mind, thoughts,
Jer. 15.1.
it always notes mercy: as in that place, If Moses and Samuel (says God)
stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: that is, I could
not love them, I could not accept of them, I could not forbear them, I could
not hold an hand of Justice from them: And the word (against) joined with Gods
face, or will, notes divine justice: as in that place, Psa. 34.16.
The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the
remembrance of them from the earth: the meaning is, these evil doers shall
have and see and feel the terrible face of Gods justice: God will appear to
them as one against them, as an enemy, and as an enemy most justly enraged by
their sin, whose very nature puts him upon their destruction: Our God is a
consuming fire: Heb. 12.29.
It Is more then to say, Our God consumes and devours up the wicked: For it
notes this, that ^he very nature of God is a consumer of his enemies, he is ^he
fire himself. When the mercy of God is expressed in the highest strain, it is
said, God i^ Love: he is Mercy it self as we^^ as has mercy: It Is infinitely
more then to say, he does love So here, to say God is a consuming fire, is
infinitely more then to say, God does consume so much is the face of the Lord
against his enemies, that hi^ very nature is against them and their consumption
shall be such as the very just nature (...) God shall lay upon them.

Secondly, the Spirit mea^ such thoughts as were toward none but his: these
alo^^ had the smiling face of the thoughts, they were not toward wicked men at
all: the adequate and full object of the^ thoughts were the people (...) God:
It Is as much as if Go^ should say, toward you (...) people, my redeemed ones.

Thirdly, such thoughts (...) naturally and most freely d^^ stream toward his:
God w^^ not compelled by any cause out of himself: who did ever move God, or
counsel him, or bid him think such thoughts toward his: he sets his own
thoughts to work by his own nature. This is for the (How) ^ow for the (Why) the
thoughts of God are said to be toward his.

First, because every thought of Gods heart is full of good will toward his:
it is for their ^dvantage, for their profit: it ^arries in it a full blessing:
it is ^^ke the Cluster of Grapes in Esaias, Isa. 65.8.
^here is new wine in it: new wine found in it, new wine ^ound to be good too:
a bles^ing was in it: So we may say ^f every thought of God toward his people,
there is wine, ^ew wine, and such new wine (...) has a blessing in it: oh, it
^^es down sweetly! it feeds, Sol. Song 7.9.
^^crishes, makes glad the soul (...) a poor creature: These ^oughts being
toward them, they are then for their prosperity, their peace, their
sanctification, their salvation: the^ are toward them for their exaltation,
deliverance, and consolation: Who can name th^^ blessing that these bring not
i^^ when they come and visit a po^^ soul? who ever was in that ev^condition,
strait temptation^ that was not delivered in enjoying the blessed fruits of
the^ thoughts? These they co^^ clothed with salvation: Luke 2.14.
the^ tune out the Angels song in t^^ ears of Gods people, Glory (...) God in
the highest, on earth pea^^ good will toward men: the bless^^^ expressions of
these though^^ what do they prove less to h^^ then mercies, embraceme^^ on
every side? The Lord thi^^ a man good, thinks a man a (...) leever, thinks him
a penite^^ thinks him yielding and ob^dient: for when he manife^^ his thoughts
of good to hi^^ the man is a new creature, he^ thus, he is all this, and more
then this. A man in a sinful condition he has an ill eye toward himself, ill
thoughts against his own soul in all he does: he is a self-destroyer, Psalm.
85.8.
these are the fruits of his own thoughts: but Gods thoughts they are all for
good, for life, for peace to a poor soul: He that speaks peace to his
people, purposes peace first, thinks thoughts of peace toward his before: Gods
good pleasure of his will which he purposes in himself, Ephesians. 1.9.
goes before the saving revelation of the mystery of his will to his.

Secondly, his thoughts may well be said to be toward them, because they tend
so much to advance and honor them: My heart (says Deborah) (...) toward the
Governors of Israel, Judge. 5.9.
that offered themselves willingly among the people: as if she had said, Oh!
how I love and honor such? Oh my heart is much taken with them! Oh^ what
commendations do the^ deserve? Oh these be nob^^ Governors indeed! So wh^^ God
says, My thoughts are toward my people, it is as much as if he should say,
These a^^ they that I intend to honor yea, delight to honor: if a^ my
purposes of good will do i^ they shall have it: if all (...) merciful thoughts
will (...) them up, they shall be advanced: Now they are base, mea^ in
captivity under the hands (...) their cruel enemies, but I wi^^ set them aloft
again: (...) thoughts run for their recovery, for the regaining of their name,
for to make them (...) name, and a praise: they shall be the head, and not the
tail: (...) have set my heart upon them (...) deliver, redeem them, crow^ them.

Thirdly, because in these thoughts of God, there was (...) mixture of the
evil of punishment, they were only, they were purely for good: thoughts not
of evil, not of afflictions, (says the Text) these thoughts were wholly made
up of merry: they be all toward you, (says God) none against you.

Fourthly, because these lo^ing thoughts of God, were ^eer the birth: when few
years (viz. 70.) were over, they would break forth and shine, and scat^er away
the darkness of their condition: these thoughts were coming directly toward
them, and that apace too.

Fifthly, because all these thoughts of God toward his, were united (as it
were) for ^his one thing, even to deliver them: Gods thoughts were not divided,
they did not set themselves one against another: some thoughts were not for
them, and some against them; ^ut all went this one way, and not with a major
vote, but with a general one, cried up the prosperity of Gods people: they all
agreed in one (nemine contradicente) as we use to say, not a thought gainsaying.

Sixthly, because all these thoughts of God toward hi^ people, continue so:
they remain fresh and strong and lively in the breast of God: these are not
like Ephraims goodness which was like the mornin^ deaw: these pass not away,
b^^ they abide in Gods heart, ti^^ they bring forth their good^ My thoughts
toward yo^^ that is, so, as that they will never turn their faces from you:
shall think still toward you, til^ I work fully according to my own thought,
according to the purpose of my own will: they be so toward you, that the^ will
come to you in the fulnes^ of their blessings: my heart i^ so on you, that I
shall not re^^ till I am at work for you.

Seventhly, because in these thoughts God aimed at this, what mercy to give
them: he (that by his own perfect wisdom, knew most exactly, the fittest
mercy to bestowed) now says, my thoughts are toward you: as if he should say,
I am thinking, yea I have already in my thought what mercy, what kind of
mercies, how many mercies, and at what season, I shall bestow them: I will fit
you with right mercies, help you with saving mercies: come to you with
seasonable mercies: fill you with ^atisfactorie mercies.

8. Because that in all these ^houghts, God next unto him-^imselfe aimed at
them, at their ^ood: God thought what merry to give, but that was not all, ^or
the main of all: my thoughts (says God) be toward, you: ^he thing I aim at
is, that you ^ay be blessed, that you may be ^riched, that you may be com^rted:
you are in my thoughts, in my eye, above, more, then all the gifts I give: it is
for your sakes I think thus: my thoughts are toward you: He that thinks
what to give to one he loves, his thoughts be not so much toward the gift, as
toward the person to whom he intends to give, and for whose sake he has such
thought-contrivings: so God he thinks indeed what to do for his own people, but
hi^ thoughts be alone toward these for whom he so thinks, upon thi^ on the
thoughts of God center, and they rest not, thy are not toward any blessing, so
as to wa^^ those whom he loves to bless.

Thirdly, for the unfolding (...) the next term: I know the thoughts I think
toward you the Spirit of God in this Phra^ speaks much, and most excellently
for the consolation of his servants, to make them assured, th^^ this was his
determination, th^^ these were his thoughts indee^ toward them: for I know the
thoughts I think toward, you: That is,

1. No man can tell my thoughts, but my self: Who can search into my decerees,
my ^urposes? Cheer up your selves my people, your own hearts may rise, and
tell you, this is ^ot, this cannot be Gods mind, Gods thoughts toward you: do
^ot you see the sad pressures you ^re under? the cloud over you is ^arke, and
when is the storm ^ke to blow over? Well, well, (says God) comfort your
selves ^oore hearts: flesh and blood ^nowes not my thoughts: Cor^uption is none
of my Counsel^^urs, is not acquainted with my ^inde: a fleshly mind is without
light, it understands not my ^ounsell: it is enough for you; that I know my
own thoughts ^^wards you: tell your corruptions, ye take too much upon ^ou:
cheer up your selves my people: your enemies may in^^t over you, as a lost, an
undone people, and run to gaze upon your misery with joy, yea, to sharpen their
eyes upon you, as such as bless themselves in your sorrows: they may think
we^ shall now have our will upon them, now we shall have o^^ lusts satisfied,
Micah. 4.12.
and our mali^ pleased: no (says God) th^^ shall not: fear not my people
(...) they know not the thoughts (...) the Lord, they understand n^^ his
Counsel: these speak without book: they utter the dream and deceits of their
own hearts I sent them not: they are no^^ of my privy Counsel: I inte^^ not
as as they: I think not (...) they: my thoughts are of another nature, run or
other end^ to other purposes: and I wi^^ make way, and work for (...) own
ends; to shape things persons and actions to my ow^ mind.

Secondly, I know (...) thoughts: that is, I understand my self, my secrets,
and all (...) ways perfectly: I can read in this secret book of my Counsels,
which is sealed up, and to deep for finite creatures to reach unto: I can, not
only enquire after the Consultations, and the determinations of my own
bowels; but I can, and do most fully know what I have there set down to a
tittle: the same Lord that searched David's heart, Psalm. 139.1, 2, 3.
and knew it, and that so, that he understood all his thoughts afar off, and
was acquainted perfectly with all his ways; he is ignorant of none of his
own ways: the Lord writes not in this book of remembrance such strange
Characters, Mal. 31.16.
that he cannot understand himself, that he cannot read them, when he comes
to look them over: God is light, and he that is light it self, what can be
dark to him.

Thirdly, I know my thoughts, that is, I look over them: all I per^se every
leaf of this book, every word, tittle, syllable of this writing: I lay not this
book of mine by me: I let it not ly, and gather dust: I am still a reading
still cying, what I have purposed, what I have promised to do for my people.

Fourthly, I know my thoughts: that is, I acknowledge my thoughts are toward
you: I prove and try them, an^ still I so confess, yea am glad, that this is
my mind: it is unchangeable, it is one and the same toward you: yo^^ thoughts
are so foolish, so variable, you are of so many minds that you do not know you
own minds: but I know my thoughts, they are united, they run one way: you may
be disstracted in your thoughts, I cannot in mine: you may be deceived in
yours, I cannot be (...) in mine.

4. The fourth, thing is what the thoughts of God pitch upon, as they be
toward, and loo^ toward his people: this the spirit of God sets down in four
heads.

1 They are thoughts of peace:

2 They are purely and only so: not of evil: that is, not of such an evil
that is opposed to peace, not of the evil of trouble, war, misery; and
therefore are all peace.

3 They are bountiful thoughts: thoughts to give: and therefore are both
loving and enriching.

4 They are bountiful to satisfaction: satisfying thoughts: thoughts to give
an end, and a most welcome one too: an end, and expectation too, (says the
Text) that is such an end, that shall answer all their longings, and
expectations of good: their desire shall come, as well as an end shall come;
and when that comes it is as a tree of life, for sweetness to the taste; Pro.
13.1.
for beauty to the eye: for joy to the heart: for life to the spirit: O how
sweet ly God does breath out mercy! Here his very thoughts be (as it were)
turned into peace, here be no thoghts of evil, trouble, pain, misery: not of
evil (says God) what then? These thoughts of mine (says God) are all for
mercy: they have no mixture of evil in them.

I am all upon giving good: upon answering prayers; fulfilling desires; sending
deliverances to my people: here is nothing sounded out, but the language of
mercy: never did the bowels of God appear more fruitful, more render, or make
a greater show then now: Our God is now in a few words, teaching his people the
fullness, the tenderness of his own bowels: he calls to the pit to them; and
tells such poor souls now deep in distress, what he thinks toward them,
that they might both mortify their own thoughts, and know how to look upon
Gods.

You think (says God) but you do but think so; thoughts of trouble, of
pain, of punishment: Oh (say you) we shall never see good day more: Object.
nothing but sorrow may we look for: we are in so that we shall never get
out: we think it impossible to be delivered.

Yea, Answ.
but you deceive your selves (says God) I have thoughts of peace toward you.

Yea, Object.
but thou have had thoughts of evil heretofore, and we still lie under the
smart of the fruits of those thoughts.

Yea, Answ.
but I have laid down these thoughts, (says God) they are come to an end, and
I have taken up thoughts of peace toward you.

Yea; but we lack so much, Object.
our wants be unspeakable, our pressures exceeding burdensome, and unless this
and that evil be removed, and our wants supplied, we shall still be in pain.
Answ.


I will give you (says God) do you want this, and want that to make you
prosperous, and your condition comfortable? le^ not that cast you down, yo^
shall have from me, from my fullness: and would you have this and that evil
removed? (...) shall be done, they shall not trouble you long.

Yea; Object.
but we have large expectations, wide desires.

What if you have; Answ.
yet I can I will satisfy you (says the Lord) you shall have your expection to
the full: I will fill you, though your mouths be opened wide.

Yea, Object.
but we have expected (...) great while already, and no good comes: we have
looked for ligh^ and behold darkness; for peace, and behold trouble.

Why yet tarry (says God): Answ.
will come in its appointed time you shall have your end and expectation too:
my thoughts o^ peace will speak at last; nay they will speak by working, by
bringing forth peace unto you: Let a poor soul raise up carnal Objections as
fast as it can for its own disconlation: why here is answer enough to stop
their mouths; water enough to quench their fire; virtue enough to take away
their stings: and reason enough to silence all of them: the very language of
these expressions of the love of God, it carries this voice in it: be silent,
Zac. 2.13
O all flesh, before the Lord: What can flesh and blood speak but here it is
answered, and its mouth stopped: let us take asunder the particular expressions,
wherein God sets forth the beauty and the sweetness of these thoughts of his,
and we shall the more clearly see which way these thoughts tend; and what God
himself intends to do for his own people.

First (says God) they be thoughts of peace: he that said before, he knew
his own thoughts; now he shows that he would have his people to know them:
and for the unfolding of his own thoughts, for the revealing and laying open
of his own bosom, he calls them thoughts of peace.

Phil. 4.7.
for the first, peace is a sweet word, and a sweater thing, (...).
it comes from God; it is the peace of God: it is more sweet, excellent, and
glorious, then man's mind can reach to, it is above the mind, above the
capacity of any man: It has more in it then the largest understanding can
behold: the word used by the Apostle, notes a having more, when a man has gone
farthest, when he has apprehended most, still he comes short in knowing what
this peace is: it denotes all the blessings God gives to his people: He will
bless his people with peace (says the Prophet David) that is, Psa. 29.11
with all that is good: When the Lord Christ is setting out his Name, his Love,
his mercy to his Saints, in a pure Gospel way, (like as God proclaims his
Name to Moses under the Law) he calls himself the Prince of Peace; Isa. 9.6.
(...)
and styles his Government, the government of Peace: and (observe it) this
title of Prince of Peace, is the last title and the sweetest, the very sum
and quintessence of all the rest: in this Title Christ discovers the very life
of his gracious Name: and whither his Name Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty
God, the everlasting Father, do all tend: and what he aims at in all these
Titles he puts upon himself, they even run all at last into this one, the
Prince of Peace; they all set him up upon the throne, as the Prince of Peace,
and proclaim his government to be full of Peace, as flowing from the wisdom
and heart of him that is the wonderful Counselor, the everlasting Father,
the Prince of Peace: for as the Prince is, so is his government: as his heart
is, so is his reign: this peace is that which as it is freely given, so it is
rarely; every one has it not, nor shall have: the voice of God to the wicked
is like Iehues voice to the messenger of that wicked King, What have thou to
do with peace? Let the wicked enquire and ask after peace; there is no peace
for thee (says God) never dream of it, Isa. 5.7.21 Psalm 11.6.
do not deceive thy self; thy portion is fire and brimstone, storm and
tempest, this is thy cup: I will rain down snares: I will rain down
troubles: I will rain down destruction upon thee. This peace is a large
thing, it reaches far. The Hebrew word is wide, yet it is narrower then peace
it self. It notes, first quiet. 2. safety. 3. Liberty. 4. Plenty, Prosperity.
5. Strength, Soundness, entireness, wholenesse. 6. Freshness and
flourishing: put all these together, they will make a brave peace, a full one
indeed: and we shall see what the Lord means by thoughts of peace, that is,
he intended to make them a quiet people, holily secure: a safe people, fully
protected from fears and enemies: a free people, full of liberty: a prosperous
people, full of plenty: an able people, full of strength: a beautiful people,
full of freshness, sweetly flourishing. 1. Inward peace.
This peace it looks two ways; either to the inside, or to the outside of a
man: the first we call peace of Conscience; this is the peace indeed: a peace
full of glory: to make up this peace, the soul must first live in CHRIST:
souls dead in sins cannot have a dram of this peace, which alone is the gift
of Jesus Christ, the Prince of peace. 2. The soul must be set in order by the
spirit of God, ere this peace can come: there must be a frame of holiness, ere
there can be the joy of peace. 3. The soul must have living and
right-grounded apprehensions of the total removal of all the guilt of his
sin, and the full purchase of the favor of God by the blood of Jesus Christ:
the guilt of sin must be taken off from burdening the Conscience ere this can
be: for the guilt of sin will let fly in the face of the soul, and cause such
troubles, such terrors, that there can be no rest till these devils be laid,
till they be cried down in the soul by the loud voice of the blood of Jesus
Christ. Hence the vote and the voice of all the souls that knew peace, is
this, Christ is our peace. Lastly, where this peace is, there is power, and a
ruling power too: Ephesians 2.14 Col. 3.1.
Let the peace of God (says the Apostle) trule in your hearts: The word notes
a chiefdome, (...).
aruling by absolute Conquest: let it carry away the victory, bear away the
Bell: let it overcome all your unbelief, your disquietments, your troubles,
all that party Satan and sin make in you, or raise against you: let this
peace in you be chief, and fit at the stern, all will be well then: things
will go in the soul of a Believer in such a way as may make for the souls
peace, as may feed that, increase that. Hence it is, that when the peace rules,
such a soul cannot sin as he did, he will not, the the seed of God (and this
seed of his peace amongst the rest) remains in him; 1 Ioh. 3.9
and that in such power, This peace ruled in Moses his heart, and put him upon
that blessed choice. Heb. 11.25.
that he will not exchange the sweetness of this peace for all the gain,
pleasures, profits of sin: nay more, this blessed peace always sits Sentinel
in a holy watchfulness, lest the soul should both trouble and grieve both his
Father and himself; dishonor his God, and interrupt his own peace. Now the
Lords thoughts toward his own, are chiefly and mainly for this peace, this
inward, l^ving, ruling, comforting peace. You shall have that peace (say^ God)
that is mine, that peace that suits with my thoughts that goes beyond yo^^
thoughts, the reach of yo^^ minds, of your understanding This peace which is
my peace, think to give to you: nay, o^ Savior says more, Ioh. 14.27
I do gi^^ to you.

Secondly, 2. Outward peace. Ier. 30.21 Is. 33.20. Ier. 30.10 Zech. 1.17
for the outward peace: this is a freedom from oppression: they shall be
(...) themselves, and no slaves to others, says God, a freedom^ from troubles
and disquiet ments: they shall be in a quiet condition, and in peaceable
habitations; a freedom from w^^ and danger, they shall be in safety, they
shall lie down safely, (...) none shall make them afraid: (...) freedom from
want and penury, they shall be in prosperity and enjoy abundance. Th^^ (says
God) shall be the outward portion of my people: it ^s in my thoughts thus to
deal with them, thus to change their condition, and bring them forth unto
light; yea to be a light my self unto them. I do not intend (says God) that
my people shall always be in captivity, always be under oppressing hands; but
I will break those ^oaks and bring them out, I will save, I will deliver them,
they shall flourish by me, and I will be glorified by them: look how far
peace can reach, extend it to the utmost, my people shall enjoy all that, and
more then can be uttered: such a peace God speaks of here.

Secondly, by thoughts of peace, he means the firm and set^ed determination of
God, touching the giving of this peace in its season, to his people, it is as
much, as if God should say, my decree is this, this is my purpose, to bestow
these blessings upon my people after so many years.

Ier. 30.5.
and not of peace amongst them; to increase their troubles, or to continue
them, beyond my appointed time: in this Phrase God does first answer what his
people might object, and lay in against their own Comforts; as thus, why Lord,
might they say, have thou not brought evil upon us all this while? we have
been under sufferings, under enemies, under captivity thus long: thy thoughts,
have been thoughts of evil toward us, and little else these many years. It Is
true (says God) but now I have thoughts not of evil; cheer up your selves
under all your smart; I think for your good, and not not for your evil: for
your good, to save you, and not for your evil to plague you.

Secondly, God does most sweetly set forth what his merciful goings amongst
his people shall be when his time shall come: it imports mercy without
mixture of sorrows: it does (in a sense) exclude afflictions: they shall have
mercy (says God) and nothing but Mercy: peace, and nothing but peace: comfort
and nothing but comfort: there be three special things the spirit points at in
this phrase, all tending to give a glorious luster to this love of God unto his
people.

1 The pureness of his mercy, how clear the stream of love should run from
the fountain of mercy, there should be no mud, but it should be a pure Rive of
water of life, Reve. 22.
clear as Crystal (like that which was showed to John in his Revelation) it
should be mercy of that nature, of that beauty, of that purity, as should show
its originaall, 'its proceeding out of the Throne of God, and of the Lamb.

2 It sets forth the cleerenesse of his mercy: Isa. 33.20.
it is mercy that shall be seen: mercy that a man may see the very face of God
in: Look, says God, Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet Habitation, a
Tabernacle that shall not be taken down, etc. Oh this was mercy indeed! Oh
this was (...) goodly sight! Oh this was visible mercy! 21. v.
Mercy, set upon a hill by the Lords own hand, that could not be hid: now, God
does speak plainly, sweetly (by the workings of his love, by the exercise of
his kindness) that his people, are a people beloved of him, Mich. 7.10 9.
that he is their Judge to plead for them; their Lawgiver, to guide them;
their King to save them: Then they that be the enemies of God, and of his
people shall see the mercies they ^ave; these shall, and do carry ^^ch a light
in with them, and in them, that the faithful ones do ^^ll them by no other
name but ^ight, and Righteousness, so ^^eere, so visible, that they are
^onfident, yea they conclude upon it, that they shall behold it, and the Enemy
shall behold it ^oo.

3 It presents to our view, Ioh. 16.^^
the ^ulnesse of mercy: ye shall have ^our bellies full of peace: you shall
have comforts suting to ^our desires; you shall have ^he exercise of my love
alone, any hand of grace alone stretched ^ut for you, to bring you in all good:
my aim is, that your joy ^ay be full: that your peace ^ay be perfect: that
all storms ^ay be over and you may be ^aved.

For the three things, they are thoughts to give: they are full of bounty: God
opens his hand and gives, and what follows? he fills and satisfies the desire
o^ every living thing: Psalm. 145.16.
the Spirit o^ God couples with an (and) Gods giving, and the creature filling;
yea Every creatures satisfaction: he opens his hand, that is his giving; and
fills, their is the plenty, there is the store^ he fills the desire too, there
is the infiniteness of his good: ye^ of every living thing; there i^ the reach
of his giving, and the blessed fruit of it too: He by his gifts can satisfy
that, which of all, is most hard to be filled the soul of man: He makes this
(though an insatiable thing) say it is enough, I have enough, I am filled, I
have all, I abound^ Thus he gives, and so satisfies: now God has this in his
heart first, He has giving thoughts ere he has a giving hand: h^^ heart is
full of his bounty, ere the expressions of his hands show his bounty; and ever
in this world the thoughts of God toward his people, are richer, are fuller
then his hands: Gods thoughts, be thoughts to give: ^he Devil and sin, they
think too, but it is to take away, it is ^o deceive, it is to kill steal and
to destroy (like the thief in the Gospel) it is how to blind, John 10.10.
how to ^arden, how to make a soul ^oose it self, loose its glory. Man needs
and (though ready ^o perish by them) scarce thinks upon his greatest needs:
God ^ees, and sees all his wants, and thinks to give, and to give a ^ull
supply to all his wants: man most what in his needs has ^carce thoughts to
ask ( hitherto ye have asked nothing, John. 16.24.
you ^now to whom it was spoken) ^et God has thoughts to give: God intends not
that all (nay that any of his love) should be, should live and dye in bare
^ords: He has thoughts to give ^ood, as well as to speak good: God, that would
have man give, and give himself to him: Psalm 84.11.
he has ^houghts in himself toward his to give himself, and then he thinks to
withhold no good: here behold, the reality, and fulness of love (both at once)
Gods thoughts are not to dissenmble with man, to make him believe, to keep him
in hand, and there is all: to make many professions of love, and yet let all
vanish away, and fall to the grouund, without real expressions of any
kindness, but this blessed sap of mercy is God, will bud blossom and bear
forth fruit too: This living spring will always run, and and will not fail:
God delights not only in the thoughts of his mercy, Ier. 9.24.
but in the exercise of his mercy, too.

Secondly, see here the fruitfulness of his love: This is to be noted, the
womb of God^ thoughts never have false Conceptions: Sol. Song. 4.2.
they never prove barren: they all bear twinns ((...) it is said of the sheep of
Christ and none is barren among them: Isa. 62.3.
Gods thoughts run out i^ to gifts, and most rich ones too. all that enjoy
these, are made by these, as a royal Diadem and a Crown of glory in the hand
of their God.

Thirdly, the freeness of these thoughts of God is here noted: God thinks to
give, where he sees no good, before he gives, to those he thinks to give, in
whom he sees no deservings, and from whom he might have withheld his mercy
without wrong to them, had his will and pleasure been so: God, where he
blesses, he blesses by giving: whom he rewards, he rewards by giving: the
soul that is made gracious, that believes, that is patient, Phil. 1.29
it is given to him, he has it this way, and no way else: a soul that is
rewarded it is by way of gift: Revel. 22.12.
Behold my reward is with me (says Christ) to give to every man according as
his work, shall be: when mercy rewards and saves, it is a gift: and when
Justice rewards and damnes, it is a gift of justice, or of debt that is due to
evil workers, and that God dos freely, of his own mind.

For the fourth thing: they are thoughts to give an end, and expectation:
satisfying thoughts: you shall have (says God) what mercy you do, will, or can
expect: God means this:

1 That they should have an end put to all their miseries: the dark cloud
should be blown over: their sufferings should have a blessed end, God himself
would put a full period to them.

2 Such an end, an end so gracious, that it should answer their living and
large expectations: Iam. 5.11.
that it should satisfy all their longings: such an end as blessed, JOB had in
his afflictions: the end of the Lord was gracious to him: the Lord did show
even in him, and by him, that he was very pitiful, and of tender mercy: so as
the Lord might well instance in JOB, for to prove what tender bowels he had: he
might well say to his children, go to JOB and see whether I am not gracious and
of tender mercy: JOBS example may learn us both the graciousnesse, that God
shows, and the patience that Saints should show. JOB had an end, and
expectation too, so gracious was God to him, and so good will God be to his
people now: I can show the like again (says God) I can do as much for you,
and so I purpose, my thought are for to walk in the same way of mercy toward
you: you shall have as much as an end and expectation will come too (that is
as good an end as you can wish, desire, or long for) now to make the mercy
thus complete, there must be in it these in gredients.

First, there must be a powerful bringing them back from their Captivity, and
an happy deliverance of them from all afflictions: Ier. 30.10
God must save his Israel from afar, and his seed from the land of their
captivity: Jacob must return, be in rest, and be quiet, and none make him
afraid.

2 A full performance of all the promises of the Lord to them: God must give
them according to his promises, or else he could not give occording to their
expectations.

3 A blessed giving in of spiritual graces, with spiritual enlargements for
grace received, for the abounding of thanks giving to wards God.

4 The shining of Gods face upon them again, which brings with it sweet and
spiritual peace: This the faithful expected.

5 All this must be done seasonably, in the best, in the fittest time: when
they were ready when the full work of God was done upon their hearts, when
their expectations and wantings were at highest; Zech. 9.1.
when they look most; when their eyes were most intentively pitched upon God:
When comes the burden upon- Hadrach, and the rests, upon Damascus, that is upon
the cruel enemies of Israel, and the inflicters of all their miseries? but
then, when the eyes of all Israel are as one man toward the Lord: and then
comes all other mercies too that they needed, even a full supply from the Lord
their God.

For the second thing, the Arguments to prove the truth now in hand: we may
reason thus.

1 Because God is Love, and this is much more then to say (God loves, 1 John
4.8, 16.
it notes thus much that it is the very Essence and nature of God: Man may
properly be said to love, but cannot be said to be love: God is so, it is
affirmed from his own mouth: when this was said, it was a piece of Gods own
mind, and it is recorded twice in one chapter, it was a sweet argument it seems,
the Apostle was now upon: he is encouraging Saints to love, and love so, as to
dwell in it, and therefore he mentions this, that God is love, Ioh. 3.16. Romans
5.8.
if they would look so high (as it is most fit they should) they might easily
see a most glorious pattere of love, that they could never reach and that was
love it self: we read of Gods so loving the world, etc. And of Gods
commending his love to us: but we read not (as I remember) of this phrase, that
God is love, but in this place: Now the servants of Christ (having not only
heard him, and seen him, and tasted him, but enjoyed abundance of glorious
fellowship with him, wherein by most certain and sweet experience, they had
been so often, so much satisfied with this River of his good pleasure) they come
up to the highest expression that can be to set out the love of God, when they
say, God is love: surely those glorious Saints in heaven, that are at the
Wel-head of happiness (as it were) and enjoy the fullness of love in the
highest degree, could not have spoken more gloriously of this love, then to
say, God is love: now if he be so; God will, First, be pitying his: Secondly,
he will be contriving for his, and Thirdly, he will be overlooking all the
unworthiness of his.

1 He will be full of pity: as a father pities, so the Lord will (says David)
Gods bowels could not but be troubled for his repenting Ephraim, Ier. 31.20.
and so troubled too, that God takes up this resolution, that he will surely
have mercy upon him: God could quickly find bowels, when Ephraim found his
sins, and his mercy says now, Ephraim is a dear son, Ephraim is a pleasant
child all is forgot already, that Ephraim has done his former Idolatry, his
former prophanenes, his former stubbornnes, it is all covered all drowned
already in the sea of his mercy: here behold bowels of compassion indeed: here
is pity that is infinitely tender: shining in the very carriage and language of
God toward poor creatures full of sins, and full of troubles, both at once:
this is the very way of Gods bowels, let his children be in danger, in
troubles, under sorrows and sufferings, the heart of God cannot rest, it will
bubble, it will be hot, it will boil up twill run over to his afflicted
children.

2 This love that is God it self, Gods own nature, twill be a contriving:
thoughts of love will flow from it: God is all act (purus actus) and so is this
love, it is busy, hard at work, plotting for, and pitching upon, some great
good for those whom he delights to choose, to love, to honor: I will surely
have mercy (says God) I will surely do such a poor sovle good: his sold
shall bless me: his conscience shall enjoy me: his spirit shall rejoice in me:
his heart shall be filled with my peac, with my comforts, with my blessings.

3 This love of God can tell how to overlook all the unworthiness of his
people: God stands not upon the poor creatures worthiness: I will have mercy,
upon whom I will have mercy, this is the voice of Gods bowels: to love freely,
this is his way: Romans 9.15 It was spoken to MOSES, yet it was all Gospel.
he will therefore think thoughts of good, because he is good, not because the
creature is good: if God bear good will to a poor soul, he will show it,
though it be to a raging, to a persecuting Saul; whiles he is a killing, God is
a saving, whilst he is making havocke of the church, God is bringing him in:
Who more profane then the Prodigal? who wasted mercies more basely then he?
And yet the Love of the Father can call in such a whretch, can embrace him in
his return, can power out it self most sweetly into his bosom, Give him the
title of this my Son, Luke 15.24.
and he has all the welcome home, that mercy it self can make for him. Who
more Idolatrous then Ephraim? he was joined to Idols (so God testifies) his
case was desperate: let him alone says God: Yet the Love of God darts upon
Epraims heart, and then he bemeanes himself, then he prays, Turn me, thou
art the Lord my God: Hos. 14.17.
then he repents and smites upon his thigh for very shame and indignation: and
what does God now when he sees and hears thus, Ier. 31.18.
of the work of grace upon Ephraims heart? Why, the next news we here is
this, Ephraim is called a dear son, and a pleasant child: who more unworthy:
and yet who wore gladly received, who more surely blessed, then Ephraim was?

2. Because the Lord by these thoughts of his dos so set up his own name: it is
no less then infinite glory that shines forth, and redounds to God by these
purposes of his.

David, Psalm. 33.1, 2, 3.
when he carges the righteous to rejoice in the Lord, and to praise him, mark
upon what grounds and why he would have this duty done: he gives three special
reasons.

1. The word of the Lord is right, 4. v.
therefore rejoice in him and bless him.

2. The works of the Lord they are such, so great, and all done in truth:
therefore bless him. 11. v.


3 The counsel of the Lord stands for ever: the thoughts of his heart to all
generations: 10. v.
He that brings the counsel of the Heathen to naught, that makes the devices
of the people (he means that are against him, his cause and people, for such
were the counsels of the Heathen) of none effect: Yet he makes his own
Counsel to stand, and his own thoughts to endure and take place, none shall
frustrate them: therefore the righteous must to work, to bless the Lord: these
thoughts of his heart must work the same effect in them, as they did upon
himself, when he cried, Psalm 139.17.
How precious are thy thoughts unto me, O God: How great is the sum of them?
These were exceeding honorable in his eyes: these took up his mind: these
drew his heart even up to as high as admiration: and well they might, for what
dos God himself commend to man, so much as his love, and what are these
thoughts, but thoughts of love?

Thirdly, because the Saint stand in such need of these thoughts of love
toward them.

1 Else they should have no mercy to save or comfort them: where there is no
conception there can be no birth looked for: God thinks first, and works
afterward: he never gave any mercy to his, but he thought them that mercy
first: What God does to, and for his, Ephesians. 1.90.
it is according to the good pleasure of his goodness which he purposed in
himself.

2 Else what bottom would there be for the Saints comforts? How could they
read before hand (so as they do) how gracious God will be to them, if there
were no promises made? And where would promises of good be from God, if there
were not purposes of good in God first? What are the Lords promises, but his
speaking thoughts of love, his proclamations of that grace, which is in the
breast and heart of God to poor believers? Now if no promises, no props of
faith, no grounds of encouragement, no not to saints themselves: take away then
these thoughts from God, and what will there remain to support a saint? How
can a soul look either for promises from God, or for faithfulness in those
promises, if God has no thoughts of love toward his?

Thirdly, else what foundation can there be of the Saints waiting? What do
Saints wait for, Lam. 3.26
but to see God bring out these thoughts of his to light (which they call the
Salvation of the Lord, the very fruits that these blessed thoughts of God
bear) if God have no purposes, it is in vine to wait; it is but lost time, and it
could not be good for any man so to do: Now the Lord enjoynes waiting: he
tells his peopls (in the midst of all their troubles) it is good to wait, and
upon this ground too, because there is Salvation of God to come for his people:
Psalm. 130.7.8.
because, with the Lord there is mercy, (that fills his heart, there be his
thoughts of love, that he always poscesses) and with him is plenteous
redemption, and he shall redeem Israel, etc. Psalm. 130.7, 8.
Their is the exercise and blessed fruit of ^is love: if God has not done ^t
as yet, yet he intends to do it: ^^aell is not yet redeemed, that ^s confessed:
God will redeem Is^srael, that is professed: if any man ^^y, Israel is in
trouble: that is ^anted: if any will say, Israel ^all not come out: that is
de^ed: their is ground jnough ^^en for the patient waiting of ^e soul upon

thankful heart: you shall have treading dowe, for treading down: Nay you
shall to the mire, (whereas I when at worst, was upon a Rock) you shall be
trodden as the mire of the streets: Who will pity you, when you fall? Who will
lament when you are destroyed? and you are never in your place till ye be thus
trodden down: Where should mire go but to the mire? and where should mire be,
but under feet? you that dream, wish, and long for, Gods forsaking of his own
servants; what thoughts have you of God, and against God the the while, but
such as deny him such as make him a lier? Woe ^o you when blindness and
deceitfulness thus leads you, you may love it, you shall one day ^^ue for it.

Jam. 1.17. (...).
it is so ^ne and the same, that there is ^ot any color or likeness, not ^o
much as any think obscurely ^^sembling the least variableness in God; with God
there (...) not so much as the rude ^ranght of turning, (so the lord notes) not
so much as ^^y give the least ground for man to say, that God is in any degree
variable or unconstant in this his glorious love, or i^ the blessed gifts and
fruits of it^ When once the face of Gods love is toward a people, it is and
'twill be, ever so: it is like the living creatures in Ezekiel, Ezekiel. 1.12
it turns not, but goes forward in most sweet expressions of it self: it runs
and streams through all the sad conditions of his people: it is as the tree of
life, Rev. 22.
it bears forth fruit, and that of all kinds, and that every month too; upon
every occasion, in every trouble, sorrow, temptation, the love of God is nigh,
his salvation is nigh them that fear him, s^ the Saints profess: and what
saves but the love of God? tha^ is nigh first, and that is the cause that
brings forth salvation: the love of God it f^^ hard at study (as it were) (...)
muses and plots for good, when the people of his love a^^ brought exceeding
low: it is a framing and devising how to save, when the ungodly are plotting
how to kill: Creatures may look strange, they^ may stand a far off (like Jobs
friends) they may prove miserable comforters (as he spoke of them, as much as
if he should have said, increasers of his misery, rather then easers of him)
but yet God will not: therefore is that expostulation of the Prophet, Why
stand thou so far off, O Lord? Psalm. 10.1.
Why bidest thou thy self in times of trouble? This breeds even wonder in a
Saint, to see God a far off; so much as to apprehend God forsaking: as if God
were not now in his place, where he would be, where he uses to be, where he
has promised to be. In times of trouble for God to be far off, for God to
hide his face, it is more then a wonder, since he has promised to be ^^eerest
then: Creatures they do but their kind, when they prove fickle and forsake:
vain things may be allowed to show their vanity: they work but from their own
nature when they fail: but for God to be variable, for this love to change it
is impossible, it is against the very nature of God, and of this love which is no
less then himself: God can tell how to love, respect, and remember his people
in a low estate: An Iron furnace in Egypt cannot put Gods love out of its way,
Egyptian bondage, Pharaos tyranny, Isreal's slavery, drudgery, poverty, quenches
not one spark of this fire of Gods love toward them: God will see for all
this, how they be used: he will pity them, respect and hear them, come down,
Exodus 3.7.8, 9.
deliver them; all their afflictions shall not dam up against his purpose of
love, nor alter his course of kindness toward them, no not when wicked men say,
Zion is cast off: nor when Zion herself says, The Lord, even Jehovah, has
forsaken me, My Lord has forgotten me. Isa. 49.14.
God complains of wrong, pleads with her, draws Arguments from natural
affection, and that in a mother too, (usual the tenderest lover) yet all this
is not high enough, the Lord grants, that a mother may forget her child; yea,
all mothers may do so; for it is possible they may put off nature in that thing
and be without natural affection, as the Lord foretells of some,) but yet God
says, it is impossible he should: he does not, nor cannot, he wills against
forgetting of his people; and can that come to pass, that Gods will is
against? who has, or what can resist his will? Nothing in God will, nothing in
the creature can: When he wills to love, to show mercy to a poor creature; this
will of his will make its way, and have its way, what ever lie in the way, or
opposes: The Prophet might well say, The mercy of the Lord is from everlasting
to everlasting to them that fear him: that is narrow enough, short enough, a
low expression enough for Gods love: time is no fit Channel to take up the
mercy of God, it will not, it cannot hold it: his purposes and thoughts for his,
they must not, they will not be straightened: they will have compass enough,
roomth and length enough, if infiniteness, if from eternity to eternity, will
give it them.

them forth, and shows the good ^n his own season: God never did, nor never
will do any thing for his on a sudden, (as I may say) that never came into his
mind before: new mercies he may give, but what be these, but the bringing forth
of old thoughts, the expressions of his eternal purposes of love? The Lord
thought, yea, declared his mind to Abraham concerning delivering of Abraham's
seed, and his Israel out of Egypt, four hundred years before hand, and many
years before they were born, or in bondage in that Land: How long did the Lord
purpose to send Jesus Christ, ere he was sent into the world? 'Twas in the
Lords thoughts before all time, Christ was a Lamb slain from the foundation of
the world, 1 Pet 1.20.
he was foreordained so, but was manifest (says the Apostle) in these last
times for you. Jesus Christ was foreordained to be a Savior before all time:
he was promised presently after the beginning of time; and yet ere he was
exhibited, 'twas thousands of years, (welnigh four thousand, if not all out:)
'twas in the fullness of time that Christ comes in: the Apostle calls it
((...)) which notes not only the fullness of time, Gal. 4.4.
but the perfection of it too, the accomplishing also, or finishing of time:
the meaning is, Christ came not till such a time, was made up, filled up,
accomplished, which God himself had appointed. Fullness of time then, if we
refer it to God, then the sense is this: A full time, that is, in Gods
account, will, decree, as it was fore-determined of God from all eternity. 2.
Refer it to Scripture, and so 'twas a full time in Scripture account, wherein
those prophesies concerning his coming, must needs be fulfilled. 3. Refer it
to the Saints, and then 'twas a full time, in that the Saints were ready for
this blessing now coming: 'twas the fullness of time in their faith, in their
persuasions, in their waitings, who at that time are said in a special manner,
to wait for redemption, and to wait for the consolation of Israel. Luke 2.25.38.
Now the Saints looked hard for the rising of this Sun, like Travelers tired
out with darkness, (what from themselves and from the times) they long for the
light: And thus even the holy ones of God, by their strong, raised, and raising
expectations, did clearly and strongly point out to the world, the near
approaching of the blessed light of that Sun of righteousness, by whose beams
the blessed day of the Gospel did soon appear, and by the brightness of whose
glory, the hearts of his did shine with heavenly light, and did rejoice with
exceeding joy, and sound consolation. God thought all good for his people ere
he promised any thing, and his promises each one have a fullness of time to
show themselves in: God purposes all at once, he acts not so; he brings out his
purposes by degrees: God determined at once before any time, to make a world;
yet when he does it, he will take six days to do it: he will not finish it
with one word, but will use many; he will not perfect it in one act, but he
will do somewhat in every of the six days: Gods thoughts of sending his
Son, were from all eternity: yet he is not promised till the world and time
are, till man is made, and has made himself a sinner too: and when is this
promise made good? Not till the world is even an aged world: not till thousands
of years were over and gone: he was promised in the first days of the world,
and 'twas the last days ere he was born: Our God loves to show unto his
servants, his unfadomable wisdom in his contrivances, his infinite power in
his workings, his ancient and eternal love in all his compassionate passages
toward his, and all these at once: the Lord intends to make them perfect,
full, complete works of love, he has them so long in the frame: the Lord
intends the patient, earnest, and long waiting of his people upon his bowels,
purposes and promises of love, (although for the present, they are encompassed
with nothing else but straits and miseries: the Lord intends to show what need
his people have of faith and patience, that after they have done the will of
God, they may inherit the promise: the Lord intends to make the fruit of his
own bowels sweet enough, delicate and dainty to the taste of believers: the
Lord intends to show how his mercies shall suit with his childrens conditions,
and how they shall fill up his peoples wants.

Psalm. 46.4.
to the wondrous gladding of the hearts of Saints: we wonder sometimes at all
the mercies Saints be clothed with, and are ready to make holy Elizabeth's
enquiry, Whence is this, and whence is that? Yea, Saints themselves, who
partake of the mercy, who are refreshed with these Rivers of Gods good
pleasure, are often set at a stand, and with holy David, fall down, Psalm. 31.19.
admire, and cry, O how great is thy goonesse! Yea, he may add this, and say,
O how deep is thy goodness! The Prophet tells us in a certain place, that the
judgments of God are as a great deep; the Apostle says more of love, he
speaks of the breadth, length and height, as well as the depth of the love of
Christ: Ephesians. 3.18.
and he speaks of all these dimensions as infinite: of such a length, of such a
breadth, of such a depth, of such an height, as that which is incomprehensible,
no mind able to reach this mystery of love: this is as deep, that it reaches as
low as the grave, as far as hell; as high as heaven; and is every way as
unsearchable as the very heart of God: do thou see a little purling stream
of mercy running to a Saint, an outward deliverance given to a Saint? why this
had its beginning in the very bowels and breast of God: trace it up to the head
to the first rise; thou shall see it first engraven in the breast of God,
concluded upon in his heart, and stamped upon the very thoughts of God, lying
and resting there first, and then bubling out in Gods season to them: do thou
see a soul called, justified, sanctified through grace, conformed to Jesus
Christ by the power of his Spirit; why all this precious love of God lay in his
electing thoughts, it was treasured, Romans 8.29.30.
it was cabinated up there first: he was predestined, and foreordained to
this mercy, to enjoy this love in Christ ere the world was: so the Apostle
witnesses.

Rev. 9.20.
concerning whom the Spirit bears record, that they can neither see, nor hear,
nor walk? can gold, silver, brass, stone, wood, the work of the crafts-man,
decree good for those that trust in them? God, the true God, he is in the
heavens, there he dwells, and there he rules, and there he blesses: Idols they
lie in the bowels of the earth, Joh. 8.23.
from thence they come: they are from beneath as Christ speaks and that every
way, both in their original, spiritual, as being from hell, and natural too,
as being in and from the earth: God he makes man, and does whatsoever pleases
him to man, and to all creatures: Idols, man's hand makes them, and a Devils
heart together; they make nothing, unless it be destruction; God has a mouth
to speak to, and for his people: he can, does, and will speak comfortably to
them: but Idols have speechles mouths: mouths that be very ciphers that
cannot speak. God has eyes, and eyes that can see, and that are open and most
vigilant to see all his peoples wants, and what will supply them: Idols eyes,
they are sightlesse eyes, eyes, and no eyes, eyes without light, and full of
darkness: God, he has ears to hear, Baal has none, though Idolaters cry, O
Baal hear us, and cry aloud, and long, yea cut and lance themselves too: God
has hands that can order his people, govern, protect, bless them: Idols hands
they are withered hands, they can do nothing, they handle not, they have no use
of them, and their followers shall have no comfort of them: they have no life,
no strength, no motion in them: thus the faithful ones in the 115. Psalm. 115.
Psalm do enter the lists with those Idolaters, and take this course to stop
the mouths of these wretches (whose usual language unto the people of God in
their affliction, was in this upbraiding way where is now your God?) by
comparing together their God upbraided, and the Heathenish God served: what be
your gods to our God (say his people) ours is in the heavens; where is yours?
upon the dunghill, earth, dunghill gods, as they are (that answer is intimated
by the faithful) our God, he is all eye, all ear, all power, all mercy, all
act: yours cannot stir, move, see, hear, do ought for you, or for themselves:
thus they lay their Idols flat, and their Dagons on the floor, and will
neither suffer Idols to be praised, nor their God to be contemned: Oh let us
have our eyes opened, and our hearts encouraged to stand up, and both openly
and earnestly to protest for God, and against all false gods, and false ways:
Oh let the consideration of this make our hearts speak truly and freely, and
say, our God, with these holy ones! Let our hearts admire our God, own our God:
plead for our God: stand for our God: let us not be ashamed to claim him: let
us not be backward to exalt him: he is in the heavens, he is worthiest of all:
he purposes good, speaks good, acts good, contrives and does, hears and
delivers his, he is best of all: he lives for ever, and so shall his Saints in
his glorious love, whilst Idols, and they that make them, and they that put
their trust in them, are and shall be dashed one against another, and shall
perish for ever like their own dung, this will be the end of these Gods, and
these slaves; whilst the children of light enjoy for ever that God who dwells
in light, and in that light that none can approach unto, or ever enjoy in any
degree without the salvation of Jesus Christ: 1 Timothy 6.16.
that God that has immortality, has all, and he only has this: Idols have
none, they must perish themselves: they can give none, their followers must to
ruin too.

1 To the bad.
and calls us to do many duties: First it speaks to me^ that are out with God,
out of Christ, and in the rude sinful and dead lump of the world: and first it
calls after them with David's voice, Psalm. 4.2.
O ye sons of men how ^^ng will ye love vanity, and follow after lies? How long
will ye both resist, and brand, the glorious ways of God, and the gracious
ways of his people, with your pride, and with your hellish ^rands of malice?
How long will ye seek after your own lies, your own wills, your own lusts? What
do you mean to forsake a God so gracious, and to cleave ^o your own Idols so
dunghie and so vain? who deserves your ^earts, if God do not? Weigh things in a
right balance; and ^ew your selves men: bring ^^rth your reasons: produce ^our
cause, your case, your way: ^et us see, what can the Idola^er say for his
ways? what ^^eas can Atheists, and drun^ards, or worldlings have? must ^^ey
not needs confess, surely they are fools, what wisdom is in them? If they
could see light, or speak truth; if sin would suffer them to open their mouths
for God; surely they would soon join with the Prophet, and say, Jer. 8.9.
Lo, we have rejected God, lo we have rejected his Word, what wisdom is in us?
How can we say we are wise? our counsels, our purposes, our practices, they all
speak out our extreme folly: there is nothing makes the sinful souls forsaking
of God, so unanswerable, as this infinite grace of God toward his: as Gods
love where it is bestowed, opens the heart, and unlooses the tongue toward
God; so this love where it is refused, is such a stop mouth, that a soul cannot
but be silenc't, it is forced to say, I have nothing to plead for my self:
there is not a wicked man in the world, who hears and refuses this rich grace
of God, i^ his purposes and gifts, but thi^ will cast, and sink him one day,
and would for the present silence him, had he but a right or true apprehension
of what he does: let unbeleevers therefore see, that though they depart from
God, yet they have no cause: they transgress without cause (as David speaks)
and although they follow sin, pursue it, cry it up, and live it up, yet they
have no cause; but unbeleevers be unreasonable, and no marvel, when pride and
blindness sit at the stern to guide the soul: see then this truth puts down
all carnal pleas, plucks up those hellish shifts, whereby sinners usually wave
off all that ^s good: can a sinner now say I shall have no mercy, if I do come
in to God, to Christ? can ^e now say I shall loose all, and ^e undone, if I
hearken; if I ^urn? can he now say I shall suffer so much, it will not be worth
while to be one of Gods? ^an he now say my own choice is best, my own ways are
best let me alone, I am well enough can he now go away sad from the blessed
offers of Jesus Christ and the gracious arms of the love of God stretched out
readi^ to embrace him? can he now say God will leave me, if (...) should follow
him; God will give me up if I should trust him. God will fail, he will forsake!
No, no, what ever souls may speak under sin, or under temptations; there will
be no such language as this, if this blessed truth once take place: all
quarrellings against God, all wranglings, all carnal pleas are now taken away,
and the soul look^ now upon God and his ways as without all exception, an^
upon sinful nature and i^ ways, as without all excuse and when once a soul
comes (...) be convinced and persuaded (...) this; oh how it blames it se^^
cries out upon, condemns (...) self, and not God at all: it (...) now a
find-fault in its own ways, not in Gods: hence it is we never read of a
Saint, as a Saint, picking quarrels against Gods ways, what ever they might do
through infirmity: when grace works, when faith acts, and sends forth its
blessed Scouts, these bring in such a good report of the Land of Promise, of
the way to it, and the giver of it; that a believers heart works another way,
so that his spirit is enlarged, and his mouth is opened in speaking good of
God, of Christ, and ill of himself, and of sin, however he spoke before this
grace was given to him: and now may we not take up David's words to the wicked,
O ye fools, when will ye be wise? when will you learn to know where to pitch,
which way to go, what to choose to bring in good to your selves? do not halt,
be not froward: if Baal be God, follow him; if fin or the world be that God,
that purposes love, shows love, saves by his love, then follow him; but if God
be God; if he be only a rock, if he only do thus, then look after him; it is
not for you to sleep, the Lord awake you: it is not for you to sit still, the
Lord rouse you up out of your base security; it is not for you to love your own,
and your old ways, you have done that too too long already: it is time to be
honest, it is no season to say (with Solomon's sluggard) yet a little while, Prove.
6.10
I would yet be, as I have been, Heb. 10.37.
and do as I have done: God says yet a little while, and he will come: thy
judgment lingers not, and will thou loyter? thy damnation sleeps not, and will thou sleep? 2 Pet. 2.3.
nay will thou be fast asleep, dead asleep, when Divine Justice slumbers not,
takes no nap at all? tell me unbeleevers, is it not for you to know judgment,
to know God in all his ways? Micah 3.
is it not for you (I do not say it is in you to seek after God, after Christ
and grace? do not think to put off God so? the Sun will not be darkened, he
that is light it self will not, Eze. 2 33.11.
cannot be blinded: he that is a most glorious Sovereign will not be bafled he
cries to you, 1 Samuel 24.25.26.27.
why will ye die? why do not you answer him, and say, Lord give us to live, why
do not you melt in your hearts, and with tears say, is this thy voice O our
Father? what have thou so much mercy, such multitudes of bowels? do thou cry
after us why will ye die, when we chose such a death our selves? oh thou have
rewarded us good, whereas we have rewarded thee evil: thou have showed us this
day, in, this voice of mercy, in these thoughts of mercy, how well thou dealest
with all thine, and willest to save those, who have killed themselves: can God
say more, then to cry return, return, my thoughts are toward you; come to
me, my mercies shall be all yours, ah poor souls you have destroyed your
selves, yet there is help in me for destroyed creatures; you have killed your
selves, yet there is life in me for dead creatures; you have damned your selves
yet there is salvation in me, for such damned creatures as you are; you have
sinned, and so have infinitely displeased me yet there is mercy enough in me to
reconcile you to me, say you bring sin, yet I can take it away; say you
multiply sin, yet I can tell how to multiply pardon, and so to forgive you all,
Isa 55.7.
as well as some, is not this Gods voice? does not God say thus much in effect
by this gracious voice, if I did intend that sin should still part betwixt you
and me, why do I call upon you, why do I proclaim this great mercy to you? my
heart (sais Christ) cannot rest, till those I dyed for, enjoy the fruit of my
death: my love (saye^ Father) will not keep in toward those I have purposed
love unto: they shall have it (says God) I will be their God, I will be their
portion, I will become their savior. Oh that sinners had ears to hear his
voice! Oh that they had such hearts in them that would believe! that would make
them restles under all their false gods, and fly to the true.

2. This truth calls upon unbeleevers to come off from glorying over the people
of God, when they are brought into a low condition by tyranny, oppression, or
any sad hand of rebuke from God: it is usual with the world, then to trample
upon the servants of Christ when they be afflicted ones: they will persecute
where God smites, they will grieve those whom God wounds: The Church (in Micah)
was no sooner down, but the world was glad, therefore she thus gives the enemy
a fair warning, she thus puts in a prohibition, Rejoice not over me, O mine
enemy, Micah. 7.8.
When I fall, I shall rise agine, when I sit in darkness the Lord will be a
light unto me: She speaks of rising again on purpose to make her enemy to
know, that he should fall, and never rise, which was not her case, nor never
should; she grants she sits in the dark, but denies that this will be her
condition still, the Lord will be a light unto me: She grants the worst, and
believes the best: It Is as much as if she should say, O mine enemy do I fall,
Oh what a fall will thou have then? Does judgment begin at me, what then will
thy end be? When I sit in the dark I have the Lord to be a light to me, but
what Lord have thou to bring thee into light? He that will raise me, will judge
thee: he that will be a light to me for my comfort, will be a terror to thee
for thy condemnation: She thus replies for herself against the ungodly, giving
them to know of her rise and recovery, as well as fall; and clearly intimating
their fall without recovery, their darkness without light, their judgment
without mercy, which shall fall upon them, and grind them to powder: take heed
then ye Wicked ones, tell not the people of God, they be outcasts, who seeks
after them, who cares for them? they be now down, they shall never up more,
now they be in miseries, there is an end of them, they shall never rise again:
What, cannot Gods Ionahs live under the waves, and in the Whales belly? What,
must his Daniels needs be broken in pieces because they be in the Lions den?
shall an Iron furnace in Egypt consume all the Israel of God? or shall an
oppressig Babylon still keep them under hatches? What, is there no sun rising?
there is no deliverance coming? Be there no thoughts of peace in the heart of
the great God toward his? Yes, yes, ye fools and blind, why then do you thus
push with your horns? Why then do ye thus pride up your selves (like Moab) and
exalt your selves against those whom God will exalt? Ier. 48.26, 27.
you will have for your pride one day, divine justice will see you paid: hear
what it is: make ye him drunken for he magnified himself against the Lord,
etc. For was not Israel a derision to thee? Was he found among thieves? thou
did use him as if he had been so, (even the very est villain upon earth)
since thou spakest of him thou skippest for joy: Oh how glad was Moab that
Israel was broken, Isreal's affliction, was her melody; But Moab shall be broken
for it: the horn of Moab (where with he pusht the people of God so) is cut
off, and his arm is broken, says the Lord: ye spiritual Philistines, ye may
sport your selves with the sorrows of Gods deer ones, it may be your mirth
cannot go well forward, 25. v.
till a blinded, imprisoned Sampson is sent for in, but what will you gain,
unless it be ruin to your selves, the loss of your own souls, of your own
lives, and all that is truly good.

3. This truth may serve to call them in from persecution, from pursuing their
bloody thoughts aginst the Saints: why boastest thou thy self in mischief O
mighty man (says David to bloody Doeg) the goodness of God endures
continually: Psalm. 54.1
Doeg thought he had done such a chare when he had told Saul where David was,
Oh how he boasted! Oh how fast he went on in pursuing him in his mischievous
ways! but David both heartens himself, and checks his enemy, with this, the
goodness of God endures continually: do what thou can, thou have not, thou
can not part either God from his goodness, or his goodness from me, or from
his people: this will endure, this will last, when thy arrows be all spent,
when thy breath is gone, when thy life is lost, and thou art drinking the very
gall of thy most deserved portion: it is as much as if David should say to Doeg,
O thou enemy how art thou besotted that think thy ways will prosper: thy
vain heart persuades thee, and thus thou say in thy self, now I shall have
my lust and my will, I shall get the upper hand: Now now I shall see David and
his fellow stumble shortly: now Saul will meet with him, and he shall never
escape his hands yea but (says David) the goodness of God endures: thou
forgettest thy self Doeg: our God has purposes of love, he has fruits of
love: his goodness endures; in it self it is so constant, that it is
unchangeable: it endures in regard of Gods own people, it is made over to them,
God himself has made it sure to them, it is so his, that it is theirs too in way
of title, and they may challenge challenge the fruits and manifestations of it
in Jesus Christ: do not thou think Doeg, that there is no more ado but kill and
slay Saints at thy pleasure (what ever God has permitted thee to do hitherto)
the goodness of God endures, it is not as yet come to an end toward the
Saints not never will: thou deceivest thy self, yet God is good to Israel; he
is good to David, he is good to all Anointed ones: thus David cooles
persecuting Doeg: and certainly, if those that are thus bad against God and his
people, could, were able, or would see God thus good unchangeably in himself,
relatively toward his people, they would have little heart to persecute: it is
a fond conceit of having the fill of their own desires upon the people of God,
that flushes wicked men so, that puts such wicked motions in life against the
Saints: it is a vain hope of success that claps them on the back, and bids
them go on, and be desperately resolute.

Secondly, let the Saints know, here is a glass for them to see many precious
duties in.

1 Ye that believe, ye that by faith are brought home to Jesus Christ, and have
the blessed fruits of these thoughts of his love powered out upon you, fall a
wondering, let it work you to admiration, and to blessed acknowledgements: such
a view should you take of the sweet ways of Gods love toward you: think not
with your selves we have mercies, and there is an end: Saints must not make
such sinful stops: you must go abroad to see mercy, and neither house up, nor
hood-wink your selves.

1 Does not God mind you when you are in your greate^ straits, under the
heaviest clouds. He has an ear to hear your groaning, when oppression has a^
hand to make you groan: Isra^^ though dis-respected in Egypt, yet has respect
in heaven; when Saints have the harshest, vilest, bloudiest usage from a proud
Pharaoh, they shall have tender mercy from their God: God that heard the voice
of a perishing Ishmael, Genesis 21.17.
the bond-womans son, will much more hear the voice of a living and a
faithful Isaac the son of the freewoman: when tyrants be trampling Saints
under feet, and writing their names in the dust, yet then are they graven upon
the palms of Gods hands, and their broken walls, their broken conditions, Isa
49.16.
are continually before him: there was never a time as long as time has been;
never a strait, as many as Saints have had, wherein God has forgotten them:
God ever yet walked with his children, though in the fiery furnace: he will be
where they be when they be where he would have them to be: he will be with his
mercy and his grace, where they be in their sorrows, and in their troubles: God
has many thoughts, and all precious thoughts of love toward them, what, do
you think that God minds not his Saints in England, that could not, that would
not, that was not unmindfull of his Saints in Egypt? do you think, that these
only are forgotten, or in this age alone God puts his people out of his mind?
or do you think that God minds not the degree of their sufferings, how far
they be gone, how low they be brought, the depth of their miseries; or the
height of their extremities, or the rage of their adversaries? or will God now
content himself with an everly look upon his peoples case, with a cast of an
eye, with a glaunce only toward them? no, no: he has them always in his
heart, upon his breast, he has them always in his eye, he has them always
graven upon his hand: behold and wonder at such love: and yet this is not all:

In the 2. place, he is a forecasting God for them, he purposes deliverances
long before [even from all eternity] his thoughts be a contriving (as it were)
the time, the best time: the way, the sweetest way: the end, the happyest end:
the mercy, the greatest mercy for his own people to have: in this way he is
now walking with his people in this land: his thoughts have been long at work
upon these things, and now is our God a bringing forth his own purposes to
light, a showing his own thoughts, now he is a telling his Saints in England
that he is a God that can love, can contrive, can take care for his people, can
tell how to send them good, to give them mercy, to work for their liberties,
for their peace: bless our God ye Saints: cause the voice of his praise to be
heard: publish and say, Who may be compared to our God? he alone is excellent
in his thoughts, in his purposes, in his bowels, in his workings: there is none
marvelous but him: there is none like unto him:

And therefore yet more in the third place; these thoughts of our God, are they
no full of wonders? do they not deserve to be sought out of all his Saints: see
into this love that passes knowledge, that is so above the reach of the minds
eye; see into the length and depth of this mercy of our God, which is so
unfadomable: these purposes, these thoughts, they are the blessed issues of
Gods own heart toward his: they are those pure and living streams, sweetly and
immediately flowing from the fountain of life it self: and how can mercy be
deeper set, then in the very nature, in the very heart of God? and can these be
any other then mercies of a full length? how can they have less then an
infinite, an eternal reach with them? are these like to end that had never any
beginning in the thoughts of God? shall man give a measure, or time put a
period to such a love? no, no: this mercy endures for ever and ever, and here
is ground enough for Saints to praise; yea, to call upon others too, and say: O
give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endures for ever: yea
to speak it over and over as David did: Psalm. 136.1, 2, 3.26. verses.
who plyes this thing so that he doubles and trebbles it, yea four times he
makes mention of it in that one Psalm: oh this pleads strongly for thanks, it
cries mightily for an high strain of praise: his mercy enduring for ever, the
Lords eternity of mercy puts on Saints hearts, sets them upon this heavenly
tune; O give thanks unto the Lord.

In the 4. and last place see, is not our God waiting to be gracious? is he not
watching over his people for good, even to bestow good? Isa. 30.18.
he will not let one season pass: every mercy he gives shall have his own
time: SOLOMON tells us, man knows not his time, and therefore it is so ill with
him: but God perfectly knows his time, and therefore it shall be well for those
that fear God: we think, O if we had Peace now! O if we had a Reformation now!
O how seasonable would it be? O if God would now send fire from heaven and
consume his enemies! O if he would now put in the sharp shekel of his justice
and reap them down! how well would it be with us? But stay, be not too hasty:
God knows his time better then thou: will thou instruct God? art thou wiser
then him? does not he know when to let out his love, when to bring forth his
purposes, his thoughts? may not God say to thee, have thou known my mind?
can thou instruct me? I tell thee God will not stay one hour too long, or
come one hour too soon with any mercy: Psalm. 1
he will take his own (now) now will I arise (says God) when it may be the
poor oppressed ones thought God exceeding long ere he arose, and were ready to
say God has forgotten us, and so to cast away their confidence: God has his
(now) hundreds of years sometimes, after the beginnings of waitings,
expectations and cries of his own people: Israel groans in Egypt hundreds of
years ere Gods (now) comes, and yet it was not too late; it was soon enough;
it was the best season of all: never then begrudge God his own time; admire
him rather for his own unfadomable depth of wisdom, that so clearly shines
forth in the very time he chooses, to bring forth his own thoughts of love in:
be wise therefore ye Saints of the most high, bless God abundantly in that he
will go his own way: in that he cannot, he will not learn any thing of any
man: he would have men learne^ all from him, and reason good: away then with
those thoughts, now, it is too late: all is past recovery: if God would have
dispatched the work in such an year, in such a month, we might have been
reformed; but now our case is desperate, now our strength is shut up and gone:
and what then? Is not this the^ time that the Lord says he will judge his
people in, and repent himself for his servants: When he sees this that they
have no^ no hand, Deuteronomy. 32.36.
no power, no strength left, but all is shut up and gone, when they are quite
spent, and are (as it were) breathing ou^ their last breath; Now (says God) it
repents me for my servants: I can forbear no longer: I cannot see them in all
this misery, and hold my peace: I cannot see them thus far gone, an^
withold my help: I cannot see them dying, and not revive them: I cannot see
them lost, and not recover them: I cannot see them in the fire, and not pluck
them out: God will never lose one of his own opportunities, wherein he may work
for the glorifying of himself and the comfort of his: O that Saints would see
who is their best friend! he that is your Father knows not only how, and why,
to let blessings fall from him; but when too: Let him ^ull the time, he will
come when it is best: best, for his own glorious name: best for your own
precious comforts.

Secondly, Saints, see your stay, your trust, your Rock, it is the Lord Jehovah
in whose heart are these thoughts of love toward his: he is the Rock, Deu.
32.4.
his work is perfect (says Moses) and what are his thoughts purposes, and
decrees then? are no^ these perfect according to which the Lords work is
framed? when the Lord saves, he saves perfectly, he compleats his Salvation so,
that he brings it up to a full work: he leaves not his work in the midst at
the half: all his ways are judgment, that is more then in judgment: they
are judgment it self, they carry in them such a clear light, such excellency
of order; such beauty and sutablenesse to the hand that works them, there is
such a fullness of an infinite God upon them, Rev. 21.25.
that (as it is said of the new Jerusalem) there is no night there: man when he
works his works are imperfect like himself, they fall from his hands half
shaped or shapelesse: and no marvel, for his very thoughts as well as his
life, are dying things: they can die, they can perish, even under his hands ere
he can finish and accomplsh them: Psa. 146.4
they breath out their last, and so not only the work underhand is left and
fallen, but even forgotten too: man's very thoughts te^ding to it are all dea^
and gone: there is no trust therefore in man (says the Pro^he^^ because his
breath goes ^orth, etc. his body dies, and ^is thoughts dye too (he means ^is
thoughts of love, his advanc^ng and friend-pleasing thoughts, and contrivances)
these perish there is not one of them to be ^een: they are all winged by ^eath,
they are fled and gone: ^ut, is it thus with our God? do ^is thoughts perish?
is all dashed and gone in a moment, what God has been thinking to all ^ternity?
Man indeed in one day ^y one stroke of death looses all ^is contriving thoughts
about ^^e world, that have been work^ng and plotting many years before: but
our God will ever ^old up, and on his own thoughts: ^hee will not lose one of
these. He who will not lose one of ^^is own Sheep, but mercy shall go for^b
from his bowels to save him: will not lose one of his own thoughts, but power
shall go forth from himself to proclaim them what they be: he^^ will never
leave remembering (...) his till he has fulfilld the good pleasure of his
goodness toward them: till he has brough^ all his thoughts of mercy into
acts, and so made his work perfect: He is a Rock indeed to bottom upon,
whose work i^ thus perfect, whose wa^es ar^ thus full of judgment: judgment
is before him (says Eli^^^ to Job) therefore trust thou i^ him: Job 35.14
(as if he should have said) God knows most perfectly what he does, in what
way h^^ goes, how to quit a soul, or how to condemn it: there is n^^ blinding
of God, no daubing up of his eyes, no darkness to him but all is light before
him: therefore trust in him, refer thy self to his mercy, let him honor that
upon thee: Trust in him, he will do thee, no wrong, judgment i^ before him: he
is a God of truth^ there is no iniquity in him. he (...) a God of mercy, there
is no ^ppression in any of his ways, ^e is without iniquity, just and ^ight is
he: O the blessed, the ^trong engagements that lie upon believers to settle
here! to ^^ttome and build upon this ^ock, to get above themselves, ^p to a God
in Christ: Nay be^old yet more, if there is ground ^^ough of a (therefore trust
in him) because judgment is before him; what ground is this ^^en, and how much
faith does ^his call for at our hands, in that mercy is before him; his
thoughts of love are ever coming into his mind, and he is ever mindful of
his Covenant, that his Love and Grace has made: He says to a poor believer,
O what shall I do unto thee? What shall I do for thee? What is thy desire,
what is thy request; it shall be granted? what is thy need, it shall be
suplied? Solomon tells us that the heart of an husband does safely trust in ^
virtuous wife, Pro. 31.11.12, 26.
for she will d^^ him good and not evil and in her tongue is the law of
kindness: and is this enough for such a trust? O then! may we no^ much more
say, the heart of a believer may, must and does trust safely in God through
Christ (...) The heart of God is an heart o^ kindness, as well as in his
tongue is the law of kindness (...) What has not God? What i^ there not in
God? to allure the soul to repose it self in him, to be his disciple, to lie
in his bosom, to lean upon his shoulders, to lie down full of joy in his
love? a poor soul that has such an husband as Christ is, may well (she has
ground enough) may without danger (there is safety enough) trust in him for all
good, for all blessed dispensations of his Grace and power to enhappy it: if
the Husband may well trust, a virtuous wife with family affaieres, how much
more may the believing soul trust Christ with all spiritual affairs: let
that God, that Savior, (will the believing soul say) be my trust, who
purposes such love, such mercy to my soul in evil times; who is a Winters sun
to my frozen heart, and a blessed springing shower to my chapt earth: I will
trust him with my conscience: trust him with my family: trust him with my name:
trust him with my estate: trust him with a Kingdom: trust him with glory, yea
both mine and his own too: he will not fail me, that never failed any: he will
not deceive me that cannot deceive one: he has thoughts of peace toward me
in all my sufferings: he has a gracious end for me out of all my sufferings:
the Lord my God has a fulness of good for me, as well as I absolute need of
his good: and he knows his own thoughts of love, better, infinitely better,
then I the great want of his love: whither should my soul betake her self!
but to this shelter: upon this ground I shall have firm footing: upon this
Rock I shall have good building: in this bosom I shall have glorious
refreshings: under this shade I shall be received: by this hand I shall be
delivered: O how excellent is that of David, who speaks experimentally too
(for how did he stand vnremoved against all Saul's, Psalm 125.1.
and Sata^^ batteries) they that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion,
which cannot be removed, but abides for ever, a believer i^ not removed, nay
cannot (and it is more) for Mount Zion cannot, and such a one is like this
mount: those that believe they be like not the world (alas, that changes every
month (with the moon) it has many new faces, strange changes: 1 John. 2.17.
alas, that passes away) but like mount Zion: and what enemy so much as ever
shook this, much less removed it: believers they are like this ^^ount: they
abide as long as the ^^ove of God himself abides, and ^^ey are as firm as the
strength (...) this love can make them: ^^erefore it is that David puts a
^etternesse upon this trusting in ^^e Lord, and tells us it is better ^^en
trusting in men; yea then ^o put confidence in Princes, Psalm. 118.8.
(a ^^ing so excellent, so precious, (...) practiced in and by the word) and
yet that is as high as our ^ust can go, if it be placed in the world: what
power is above ^^inces power, yea the conjoined power of all the Princes of ^he
world together? and yet all ^his makes no rock at all: it is ^ut as an heap of
sand, there is ^^o building upon it in any case: trusting in God is better: it
is a wise and a sure way whatever the cause be: a man would think, if it were
unsafe in any case, it were so in this: when a poor Soul walks in darkness,
and has no light: is full of terrors, and has no Comforter^ is in great
straits of of spirit, and has no ease: is full of trouble^ within, and has no
peace: thi^ poor creature thinks his case i^ desperate, Isa 50.10.
and that he is a lo^^ man: this is a strait: this is an^ headlong condition
indeed: ye^ (says the Prophet) let that ma^^ trust in the name of the Lord:
let that poor soul stay upon hi^ God: as desperate as his case seems to be;
though in his own eye he is a damned man; though in the worlds eye, he is
irrecoverable; yet (says he) trusting i^ the Lord, Staying upon his God will
perfectly cure that man: he shall not miscarry in this case (as deadly, as it
shows to be) if h^ can cast himself upon his God^ his God has thought of
peace^ promises of peace, a covenant (...) peace, blood of peace for him: God
will raise up that soul; shin^ into that soul: be a light to that soul: a
Prince of peace, a father of mercy, and God of all comforts to him, and
whenever God does this, he does more, ^^en if he should remove our word,
our miseries, our troubles, and make all at peace in the Kingdom: O that God
would ^ay the hearts of Christi^ns here! Sol. Song. 2.14.
O that they were how in the clefts of this Rock (like Christ's Dove) was there
^ver a better time to rest in God ^hen now? O let the name of ^he Lord be
precious to you! do not only try now, or taste what ^one, how good God is; but
be ^onfident what he will be to you: can your case be worse then to be
killed, yea that God himself should do it, an that in anger too (as one would
think) yet Job will trust in him: Job. 13.15.
he cannot trust in a living God, that cannot trust in a killing God; Job had
so learned a God in Christ: and great cause he had, for where he loves, nothing
can remove his Love: he will have thoughts of peace, and he will have a desire
to the work of hi^ hands, Job 14.15
and who shall let him (...) the Enemy would, he shall not (...) What shall be
able to separat^ from this love, or so much as give a stop or check to the
working of it.

Isa. 12.3.
God, even our God he has merciful purposes, he has thoughts of peace
toward you^ believers, behold your Father clothed with his own bowels,
putting on his whole nature of love, conceiving for you, decreeing for you, and
reaching out mercy with both hands (as it were) to you: what must you do? lo
here is for you: it is no time to sit still: you must be doing: your work is
before your eyes: draw out now, these waterpots be full to the bri, and full of
excellent wine too: say what should hinder us, that we should not have the
fruit of these merciful thoughts of our God in these days? shall we starve
when there is bread to be had? shall we have this rock before us, and not suck
any honey out of it? when Ioab perceived that the heart of David was toward
rebellious and banished Absalom; mark, how he lays his train; how he plots,
and projects to fetch out David's heart, to bring it above ground, 2. Sam. 14
to make David's soul (that longed to go forth to Absalom) to go forth indeed:
he fetches a wise woman from Tekoa, and she must insinuate her self, and mask
over the matter with dark sayings, to get within David, and persawade him to
fetch home his banished: and for this end, she has her lesson from him; he
puts words into her mouth, and all to fetch about the thing by such a form of
speech as was like to be most prevailing: believers see a pattern for your
selves in this case: God he longs, and his Soul goes forth by longing, to his
people, in their miseries, in their troubles, in their banishments, in this
rageing time of the sword; his Soul is grieved for their affliction, David's
Ioabs, the Lords anointed are to take special notice of this: they are to
send their Tekoas to their David, to use Gods own instituted means, to draw
out these bowels of God, to make these thoughts visible, and to come abroad,
did not once David long to fetch home his banished, and we not long to have
these longings forth: let not God, let not Christ have cause to say (as he
sometimes spoke in the case of his sufferings) he looked, Isa. 62.5. and 64.7.
and there was none to help; he wondered that there was none to uphold: what
none to stir in such a case? what none to stir up himself to take hold of
Christ? what none to draw out the love of God in Christ toward his people?
what none to power out their hearts, none to utter words before God, none to
fetch this thing about, by the wisdom of the Spirit? where are our bowels of
mercies which he (that has put on such bowels himself toward us) calls us to
put on? what shall we see a blessed treasury of divine love, and never go to
the door or use the key to open it? oh draw out Gods Soul, Christ's heart unto
thee! get out these purposes of love, that they may come abroad, that they may
dwell in thy heart, and in the Saints more plentifully: O yet enough to make
thy Soul an habitation for thee to dwell in! it is the surest, the gloriousest
habitation in the whole world! o if divine love, be a roof over thee, and a
dwelling place for thee, who can enter in at these doors to harm thee? who
can curse thee into woe, or thee from weal, from blessedness? who can cast
thee out of thy house, when thou dwell in God? who can keep thee from thy
treasure of riches, Isa. 58.10
of honor, of Comfort and peace, when the purposes of thy God run for thy
enjoyment of them all? some truths, and some necessities bespeaks us to draw
out our souls toward others: this truth bespeaks our graces, our care, labor,
endeavor, to draw out Gods heart to us: when we do the first we see and hear
the needs of others; when we do the latter, then God will see and hear, and
his thoughts will act forth to the greatest advantage for us: let believers
therefore put forth themselves and their graces for this purpose to draw out
more of God of Christ, they shall be satisfied, the purposes of Gods love will
come, and shine, and shine forth too: see then believers your work in a
storm: what excellent handed creatures, how useful in trying times you shoul
be: how you should put on to work to do, that the thoughts of God toward
you, may not only come to the birth, but may be borne, appear, and come
abroad: and the better to guide you, hearken to a few rules in this case which
are the very high road, the strait way to from out these thoughts of love
draw our God.

First, longing souls after this merciful appearing of God unto his, these
will never miscarry: Psalm. 107.9. Psalm. 141.19.
the Lord will satisfy the desire of every longing soul. God intends not that
his Saints spiritual longings shall kill them: he intends satifaction, not
confusion to them: he that gives these desires, will fulfill them: when the
ways of a soul, is the way of Gods fear, that way cannot do less then
prosper, where God is Alpha, he will be Omega: where he begins, he will end:
where he works to desire, there he will satisfy to delight: 1 Chronicles. 11.17,
18.
When David longed for water from the well of Bethlehem, and said, Oh that one
would give me to drink of it! His friends would rather venture their own
lives, then he should not have his desire: they put their lives in jeopardie,
they break through the host of the Philistines, and fetch him water, not
regarding their own lives to supply him: Oh what will our God do, (may we well
think to give) in the desires of his longing servants? surely he will break
through all, to give them of the waters of the well of life: He will break
through the Host of their unworthiness, through their enemies, through their
lusts, through their unthankfulness, to fill them with good, to give them his
refreshings: it is not a Philistine shall stand in his way of mercy to his
people: nor yet whole hosts of them: Who art thou O great Mountain says God
in this case, when he intends to reform his people and to satifie them: in
this case, Zech. 4.7.
when any thing comes in the way to withstand him, who art (says God) thou
great Moun-great Mountain of unbelief, thou great Mountain of pride, thou
great Mountain of impatiencie? before my people you shall become a plain; you
shall down: you shall be subdued. I will fulfill the desires of my people: I
will replenish every hungry soul: I will satiate every weary soul: this is my
will, Ier. 31.25.
and this shall be done: Believers, long not so for peace, Psa. 101.2.
as for the God of peace: say with holy David: Oh, when will he come unto us?
Oh when will his thoughts of mercy be brought forth? you may have peace with a
Plague: plenty with a Plague; you may have outward mercies sauced (as the
Israelites quails were) with vengeance: but you cannot have your God with a
plague: you cannot have his face shining with such darkness clouding: one
misery may sad, and another (it may be a far worse) may begin, which may
include in it a seven-times more, in respect of sorrow and burden: but if we
long for the appearing of these merciful thoughts of God, and they come; there
will be no such after claps: no such degrees or successions of evil: but this
will be a sight worth seeing: this will be good worth enjoying: this will be
rich mercy where ever it comes. Oh let it never be said, if we had longed for
the gracious commings of our God, they had been ours: our God would have come,
and would not have kept silence: the Gospel would have come, and would not
have been stopped: a Reformation would have come, and that a pure one too: Peace
would have come, and a sweet one too: let not our God long to have us thus to
long, and yet have cause to complain, and say, oh that mine had hearkened! oh
that mine had longed. What shall we not thus love when we may satisfy Gods
desire by our longing, and enjoy all the good we can desire too? The hungry
after Christ shall be satisfied: he fills the hungry with good things (says
Mary) they shall have enough, Luke 1.53
for they shall be filled, and that not with wind neither but but with good
things: she speaks this by blessed experience too: God had filled her hungry
soul with infinite good: insomuch that she proclaims for joy, the usual and
most gracious dealing of God with all that be his; and tells us God fills them
with good that be hungry: and what do these hunger after? Surely for the
coming of Christ: their desires cried: oh when shall our Savior come? when
shall he be born? when shall we see the consolation of Israel? And did these
long in vain? did they hunger without filling? were they empty without
satisfaction? No, no, he that sends the rich empty away, will not send the poor
in spirit empty away: such as are full in themselves, such as have no such
hungring in them, they shall not be filled with Messes from the Lords own
Table, they shall be turned off with a (go to the Gods whom ye have served) let
them fill you, that have had you: you like none of my dainties, and you shall
taste none of my supper: but to the hungry (says God) come ye shall find
food: come ye shall find rest: you shall have your laps full, your bellies
full, your souls full, from the fullness of Jesus Christ: Christ loves to power
his water upon dry ground, to sow his seed upon good ground, to come where he
is wished for, where he is earnestly desired; when the souls cry is, oh when
will Christ come? he will quickly answer him and say, so I come: Isa. 58.9.
behold here am I: poor souls you shall have what you long for, what you are
so earnest for at my hands: O thou longing soul, be it unto thee according to
thy longing: this thou would have, this thou shall have, even my salvation:
it is none of Gods ways to send empty souls, empty away, either from his
presence, from his hand, or from his doors: their longings be his, therefore
his satisfying mercies shall be theirs: Gods promise to such a soul is, open
thy mouth full wide, and I will fill it: let it be never so wide opened, God
knows what he can do: it is not out of his teach: it is in his power: it is
his will: it is his love: it is his mind to fulfill such a soul.

Secondly, ye that would draw waters out of these wels of salvation, ye that
would have these merciful meanings of our God for your selves and his, look to
it that you strongly expect the appearance of these thoughts of his love: oh
let your expectations be true, earnest, large: the Messiah, the Lords Christ,
was long expected ere he was exhibited: and more mighty then ordinary were the
expectations of the faithful, when the time drew nigh: their hearts were much
more carried out after the consolation of Israel: Lu. 2.25.
Simeons heart was not only hot in devotion, but in expectation too: and there
were so many that looked for redemption of Jerusalem in Israel, that they made
up (an all them) for Anna the Prophetess spoke of Christ (when he was brought
to be presented to the Lord in the Temple) to all them that looked for
redemption in Israel: Christ he was the desire of all nations, Hag. 2.7. Zach.
9.1.
as well as the Savior of all that did so desire him: the eyes of all the true
Israelites were waiting eyes this way: they their eyes were toward the Lord: and
it was to behold their King coming unto them: and it was not long after that
God said to the daughter of Zion, behold thy King comes: within the compass
of 8. verses God gives him in to her; so successful, so prosperous does this
way prove to the Saints of God: when does God in the way of his ordinary
providence give unto his creatures? when does he open his hand to them for
their satisfaction, but even then, when the eyes of all things wait upon him?
Psalm. 145.15, 16. and 40.1.
when had Daivd his God so inclined to him, as to hear his cry, but when he
waited patiently for the Lord? when David's soul was so strongly set upon the
gracions answer that he should have from God, that he can wait in waiting,
dwell upon the duty, double his patience, and never look off from the God he
cried to, he shall quickly have the deliverance he cried for and be brought
sweetly out of the miery clay, his feet shall be set upon a rock, and his
goings ordered: as he was ever looking toward the Lord, to give him the thing
he wanted: to deliver him from the thing he felt or feared; so his God came
accordingly: our God not only toward his, purposes an end, but an expectation
too (as it is in the Text) an end in respect of their miseries: an expectation
in respect of faith and his promises: it is as much, as if God should say, I
will then put an end to all the afflictions of my people: I will then give
deliverances, peace, and all good, when my peoples expectations are strong for
it: when they so expect, then I will do: when I give peace it shall be an
expected peace: when I give good, it shall be an expected good: when I give an
end, it shall be an expected end: our God intends to have his mercy welcome
when it comes; and therefore he will make the hearts of Believers work after it,
look for it, settle upon it, ere it comes: our God intends to have his given,
to be kept on foot, to have some springing of that he has already sown, ere
the remainder of mercy laid up in his promises shall come: he will see how his
children will trade with that stock alroady given, ere he will trust them with
more: he that knows when is his season to give out his mercy, will never
bestow it, till he can say, now it is seasonable: now is the right time: now
behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me, etc. come now
therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, Exodus 3.9.10.
that thou may bring forth my people out of Egypt: See God has his now, ere
the cry of the Israelites comes to him: his now, ere he hears their cry: his
now, ere he comes down to deliver: his now, ere he sends Moses to Pharaoh upon
this errand of deliverance: and this his now was not, till they had been under
the Egyptian slavery many years: till all their male children had the black
doom of death upon them: till their sighs and groans broke forth into cries,
and their cries came up to God, which did therefore ascend so high, because they
were mixed with so much faith and expectation, which spoke thus much in Gods
ears, that surely he that dwells in heaven, and was their God, would see their
oppressions with a pitying eye, would hear their groans with a merciful
heart, and come down with his love, and with his power, for to deliver them.

Thirdly, Christians live by faith: put forth, and that to the life, this
living grace: take need of despising promises, of staggering at, or of being
beaten back from these sweet words and precious things of God, made and
ratified, given and performed to us in JESUS CHRIST: has our GOD said it, and
will he not do it? has he spoken any thing that he will let fall, and not
bring to pass? What, are Iehovahs words but as wind? see to it that nothing
beat you off from believing in Gods purposes, in his thoughts, so sweetly
revealed in his promises for you, and to you: if you will have God, (Now) come
for deliverance, for Salvation, let God have his (Now) for believing: our Gods
voice is (Now) if ye can believe; (Now) if ye canrest upon me; Heb. 3.7.
To day if ye hear my voice of mercy, ye shall enter into my rest: the
Israelites were brought into Canaan by faith, and unbelief shut the door
against thousands of them, that they could never enter in: if we stand and say,
Heb. 19. v.
there be Giants in the way to our peace: there be sons of Anack: there be
walls: there be Wars: there be Enemies open and secret, betwixt us and our
good: us and our Gospel: us and our peace: if we suffer our selves to
backslide from Christ (the Captain of our Salvation) to fly off from promises,
to sink with discouragements, and to cry out in the midst we are all undone:
we are past cure: we can never be reformed: We can never have a right, a
blessed peace: what is this, but to say, with the unbeleeving Israelites, we
shall never be able to overcome the Giants, to climb up the walls, to
possess Canaan, and some indeed to shut the door of hope against our selves,
turn the fruitful Valley of Achor (which the Lord would give us into the
stony and barren wilderness of of our own unbeleefe? What is this but to stop
up all, that might never enter in nor enjoy what God purposes for, and promises
to these that do believe? Christians, if we can believe, we may conclude all
things are possible; let us not clip our own wings, our wings of Faith
especially, Isa. 40.41.
how shall we fly then? How shall we mount up as Eagles then, far above all
below things, to Jesus Christ? How shall we be settled then, nay how shall we
choose but hover and flutter up and down, upon the earth of our own hearts, and
of the times? Christians, see to it, unbelief is a bloody thing: it knits
more, it kills worse then any sword: unbelief is the greatest plunderer: it
takes a way all: it leaves nothing, no not a promise of mercy, nor a God that
promises it: do you not think the sword kills enough? do you not think the
enemies of Christ plunder enough waste enough? Oh be not self destoyers by
selfe-unbelieefe! Our greatest danger lies here: if ever we miscary; if ever we
be shut out of Canaan; if ever we be cut off and perish; the enemy and
adversary is this Wicked Haman: this accursed unbelief: it sels us and all we
have, first over to sin, and then to misery: it makes a forfeiture of all we
have into the hands justice, ye and keeps off all good that is coming into
our hands: Oh believe and and we shall prosper! believe, and the stream will
be turned: God will be found: Israel will be saved: the Canaanites will be
bread for us, and God himself will be a portion for us: we are now like to
gain much, or lose much: if faith turn the Scales we are made; if unbelief
turn the Scales, we are destroyed. Our God is now laying a foundation for many
generations, a foundation of such good, that not only his servants in this
present age, but the children that are yet unborne might bless him for these
beginnings of such love, for the first stone laid in our days: Oh! let not us
remove such a foundation, let us not roll away this stone with the accursed
hands of unbeleefe: What, shall we cloud the Sun from our selves, that it may
not shine upon us? Shall we blast the blossoms and buds of mercy by the
East-winde of our unbeleefe? shall we blow away the sweet showers of blessing,
with the rough wind of our own lusts? God forbid: believers this is all the
burden the Spirit of God puts upon you: that which ye have (who have Christ,
graces, light promises) hold fast till Christ comes: the zeal you have for the
Lord God of Hosts, for Christ the Captain of Salvation and the King of Saints,
against Rome, against sin, against the times, hold fast, the faith and
confidence you have in Christ, in his promises, hold fast: the title you have
to Christ to all good in him, hold fast: leave not a promise, no not the least
title in a promise of a thousand worlds: deal with these (as Job resolved and
did with his integrity) hold them fast till ye dye: let no enemy remove you
from these; hold these, when ye cannot hold your estates: when you must leave
creatures, resolve upon it to keep these: let not fears affright thee, or
allurements entice thee to withdraw thy self, and to return from following
after these: but say to promises (yea to Christ, who speaks in, and by them, to
thee) as Ruth said to Naomi: Ruth. 1.16
where thou go I will go: and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: I will be
where Christ is: I will live, where Christ lives: I will walk where he walks:
I will dwell were he dwells: Nothing shall persuade me to return from
following after thee: from resting upon thy word: I will not live in the hopes
of men: I will not live in the success of our Armies: I will not live in the
overthrow of the Enemies: these things may alter, and the scales may soon
turn: but I will live in the love, and in the light of my God: this turns
not: this is unchangeable: Oh! who but he is blessed, who trusts in the Lord,
and whose hope the Lord is? Oh believers! Would you be planted by the waters of
mercy? would you prosper? Would you spread out your viols by the River of his
love? would you be still green, would you be fruitful, and not cease bearing?
would you look well, and thrive in these years of drought? Ier. 17.7, 8.
Why trust in Jehovah: he can and will do all this, yea all things for you:
well might the Apostle say, Heb. 10.38.
the just shall live by faith: and put a (Now) to it too: for it was in such a
(Now) in such a time wherein reproaches, afflictions, and persecutions were so
rife, so hot against the Saints: It Was in such a (Now) wherein the saints were
spoiled of their goods: it was in such a (now) wherein they were in a very fiery
trial, and endured a great fight of afflictions, and wherein in all points
(the Apostle saw) they had more then ordinary need of patience: Now (says he)
when even all things are at such a sad point, thus desperate: Now, when the
world is thus mad, thus up in arms against the people of God: Now live by
faith, this can live, and never better then now: Now this grace drives an
excellent trade: now it has a time of it: faith is up when other things be
down: it lifts up the head, is green and flourishes even in the dead of
Winter: Believers see to it; as you have need of patience to bear your burdens;
so you have need of faith to fetch off your burdens: believe, and you shall see
sunshine through the clouds: liberties, through troubles: light through
darkness: peace, through war: the Gospel, through Rome: unity through divisions:
amity, through envy: and an happy reformation, through an unhappie confusion;
if your faith fail not, God will be with you, he will not fail: blessings will
come, they will not fail: Curses will be removed, they shall not stay.

Fourtly, and lastly you must wrestle, and with a prevailing wrestling too, ere
these thoughts of good of peace be like to come forth to you: God purposed to
deliver Jacob from his brother Esau that he should smile upon upon him, rather
then rage, Genesis 32.9, etc. Hos. 12.4.
and smite the mother with the children; but Jacob must pray, and with God for
it first: he must weep and make supplication; he pleads the Covenant God made
with his fathers, Abraham and Isaac, and say the God of my father Abraham, and
the God of my father Isaac: he pleads the Commission he had from God to return
to his Country, and to his kindred; he pleads that God had said, if he did
return he would deal well with him; yea more, thon said, I will surely do
thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the Sea, which cannot be numbered
for multitude; and now my brother Esau is coming, and I fear him least he
will come and smite me, and the Mother with the children; 12. v.
Jacob by his faith pitching upon the word of Gods promise wrestles hard for
deliverance: and ere he has done, he has a new name given him, and that so
significant as tells him, that as a Prince he has power with God and with men
and has prevailed: and upon this as God gives, Jacob a new name, 28. v.
so Jacob gives the place a new name, and calls it it Peniel (the very face of
God) for (says he) I have seen God face to face, 30. v.
and my life is preferved: Now Iacoh has such an answer; that he can say, he
has seen God: as well as that he has sought God: and that his life is
preserved though he has so seen GOD, and that it shall be preserved when ever
he sees his brother Esau: From the sight of his God he saw preservation, and
did absolutely conclude upon a sweet deliverance from his brothers rage: Genesis
33.4.
Therefore when Esau mets Jacob in such a way of love, when he runs to meet
him: when he embraces him; falls on his neck and kisses him: 10. v.
Oh (says JACOB) I bave seen thy face as though I had seen the face of God;
and thou wast pleased with me: (as if he should say) I read thus much
concerning thy kindness to me, when I saw my God face to face: and now in this
thy brotherly carriage I am put in mind of the fountain and bottom of it:
it is not thy nature brother Esau: it is the face of my God toward me: I have
prevailed with God: and he has prevailed over thee: thy countenance was
clouded, and thy heart enraged: but the face of my God shining upon me has
changed the fierceness of thy countenace against me: and turned it so, as
thou art pleased with me; Believers know if ye can and do wrestle as Jacob,
you shall prevail as he: this you shall be sure of, to see Esaues, as if ye
had seen the face of GOD: this you shall be sure of, to see the face of God in
the sword, in the war: in all the troubles that befall us, and this will
sweeten all, and give you to see your selves, as more then conquerors, thorough
him that loves you. Daniel sets his face to the Lord God, Dan. 9.3.
to seek by prayer and supplication, to have these thoughts of God, of good,
drawn out to the poor captivated Jews: he goes to it with fasting and
sackcloth and ashes, to get off the desolations of Jerusalem. Believers, know
not God will be sought to, enquired, and looked after: if you expect an
expected end; know also the Lord expects the means tending thereunto: what,
have you no tears, no groans, no prayers to present the Lord withal? Have
you no fire upon the Altars of your hearts for Christ, Rev. 8.5.
and against sin? how should Christ come then, and fill his censer, and cast it
into the earth, and so cause voices, and thundrings, and lightnings, and an
earthquake, that may shake, remove and destroy all his Enemies? Stand, ye
Saints, Jer 6.16.
and see, and ask, which is the good old way, and walk therein, and ye shall
find rest for your souls: this has been that good, that old way of drawing
out purposes of love toward his people: believers, know, ye must thresh ere
the end and expectation will come: Mic. 4.13.
the daughter of Zion must not now be delicate: she must plow, and sow, and
break the clods, and expect with patience the former and the latter rain, and
gather in her crop, and thresh too when she has done: and all this too, ere
the end and expectation can, or will come: ye must wrestle, ye must strive, it
will not be else: oh be content, to be in many labors; in many agonyes, to
travail with Zion: be content to endure hardness: much more to be often with
God: to be earnest with him: he has bowels to pity: he has an eye to see: he
has an hand to help: and therefore will have an ear to hear: has our God
given into our hands the blessed key of his own treasury of love, and will you
hide it, or pack it up rather then open the door with it? what shall God, the
same God, (who by his grace and Spirit makes the prayers, and makes them so
prevailing, and perfectly knows that hidden strength of the prayers of faith)
shall he come and tell us they prevail, and prevail much (and that in the
lowest and saddest state of the Saints too) and shall we lay them aside? what,
do we look, that either a Gospel reformation, or a merciful peace should be
so given to us, as to be put into our mouths, whilst we are prayerlesse,
sleeping, slothful? have we wrestled against God, like froward ones, and shall
we not wrestle with God, like believers? have we given our hearts, our hands,
our help, to make a land naked and waste, Col 3.12.
and shall we look after no covering, no clothing, no mercy for it? oh, put on
bowels of mercy, and as the Elect of God too: natural compassions, or some
piece of Spiritual mercyes let not them serve your turn; but put on bowels in
a way of love and tenderness; as you have put on Christ in a way of faith:
Phil. 2.1.
if there be any consolation (yea salvation which is the cause of it) in
Christ; if there be any comfort in love; if there be any fellowship of the
spirit; if there be any bowels and mercies; fulfill the joy of Gods people:
answer their expectations: set in to GOD for them: (yea for your selves) in
these needful times: On let not a Land sink, becasue you will not pray:
because your hearts sink from God! Oh let not Amalek prevail, because you will
not hold up your hand! Oh let not the Goliahs still boast, dare, and defy,
because there be no David's to go forth against them! Why may not the prayers of
Faith save a sick Land, a dying, a bleeding Kingdom, from the hurtful sword?
Why may not God accept of tears in Christ, the powrings out of the soul in
him? Job. 22.30.
Why may not the innocent (so are believers looked upon in Christ) deliver the
Island? Who knows what a spirit of grace, and supplication can do, may do? He
is faithful that has promised, he will do what ever he has said: the Lord
make his people earnest in pleading, and faithful in applying his promises,
faithful in suing to his throne by instant and incessant prayers: in working
up and winding up their hearts to a strong, a patient, a joyful dependence on
him; and then if we perish we perish; we may then lose all lose-able things
with comfort: and find all saving and eternal things in God: oh thou
believing soul, do but think what solid consolation thou shall reapt; when
thou can call the salvation of God (Naphtali) my wrestling: when the soul can
call the downfall of Idolatry; my wrestling: a right Reformation; my wrestling:
an happy execution; my wrestling: a putting up of the sword, and the commings
in of a sweet peace; my wrestling: and can say concerning Gods deliverances,
his salvations (as Rachel said sometimes in another case) with great wrastlings
have I wrastled with my God, and I have prevailed: for this, and for that, and
the other mercy I prayed: 1 Samuel 1.20.
and the Lord has given me my petitions which I asked of him. Oh it will
exceedingly rejoice the heart of a Believer! to see all his mercies: and all
the faithful ones mereies too, to be as (so many Samuels) so many things asked
of God; as well as given of him: Christians let me bespeak you with the words
of the Prophet, Isa 62.6, 7.
and lay it close with the Lords own charge upon you. Ye that make mention of
the Lord keep not silence, and give him no rest, till he establish (for that
our God will do) and till he make Jerusalem a praise (though now it is made a
prey) in the whole earth: You are not to keep silence now: you are not to sit
still, sullen, cast down, or disquieted: you are not now to faint, but to
bestir your selves, to work that God may work: you cannot build Jerusalem, or
establish it when it is built, or make it famous, make a praise whilst it
stands: it is not in your power; but you know a God that can: you love a God
that can: up to him then: wrestle, strive to enter into his bowels of love; get
but him to work: get but his right hand to save: get but the arm of his
strength, of his salvation to be made bare for us, and we shall be saved: Zion
shall be comforted, and all her Enemies trodden down as the mire of the street.

Zechariah) with good words and comfortable words: Zech. 1.13
we now have our ears filled with sad complaints: and how usually and freely, do
men take on for their losses? Thus it is with me (says one) and thus it is
with me (says another) call not me (Naomi) call not me pleasant, but call me
Mara; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me: I was full, Ruth 1.20
but now I am empty: I was worth so much within these few days, but now I have
lost all; oh the Lord has testified against me! oh the Almighty has afflicted
me! well grant all this, let there be even floods of misery abroad; say, man's
day of darkness is begun; what then, is there no hope, no Savior? Psalm. 39.7.
may not the Saints turn themselves toward God, and say Lord our hope is even
in thee? what do we wait for? what is all our hope, besides this hope? states,
names, friends, an arm of flesh, carnal contrivances, worldly dependencies, are
they not all Spiders webs? are they not suddenly and easily swept down? Truly
our hope is in thee: in thy love: in thy fullness: in thy thoughts: in thy
blessed purposes: here we can read peace in trouble: good, in evil, both
things, and times: light in darkness: comfort in sorrows: Oh let us rejoice
in these thoughts of our God: rejoice in the Lord ye righteous: and well they
may, is there not cause? look not upon God through the false glass of the
times: look not upon this Sun, as in an Eclipse: he is ri^ing, he is shining:
he is warming those souls he looks and darts upon: who can make void, who can
empty out Gods purposes of love: who can turn the course of the stream of his
mercy? who can hinder God in the bringing forth of his own thoughts in his own
time? who can make God either ignorant of what he knows, or forgetful of what
he still remembers? he that knows the thoughts of peace he has toward his
people: knows also his people (all his sheep) for whom he has these thoughts
of his peace: rejoice in it ye Saints! it is a portion, a glorious and full one
too; a portion peculiar to your selves; there is not one shall share with you,
but he that is like you; a child of this father as well as your selves:
Rejoice in it, ye Saints, it is as certain as God is; he has as certainly such
thoughts toward you, as he is love and has the nature of a God in himself.
Rejoice ye righteous; ye know not how soon these thoughts of peace may appear
above ground; they have been sown long; yea and they will never dye under the
clod; they have been in the breast of God from all eternity; Here is light
sown for the righteous, and do they not begin to peep forth? do you see no
blade, no sign of such merciful thoughts abroad now? may we not track the
footsteps of these thoughts all along; through a Parliament in their
proceedings; through an Army, in their fightings; through Christ his Messengers
and Members, in their Liberties? Stand up then by faith; lift up your hearts in
the midst of troubles; if wrath be begun, yet mercy is begun too; if wrath be
gone forth, yet thoughts of peace are abroad too: do not say I am under
temptations, I have lost my friends, and my means, have me excused, I cannot
rejoice:

Obj. Who will excuse thee?

Answ. I know none, but I know who will accuse thee, even this truth will, if
thou do not rejoice.

Obj. Yea, but Rome has such bloody thoughts, her instruments are now abroad,
and they are for war, plundering, spoiling, and cruelty.

Answ. What then, look up to heaven, here be thoughts of mercy; here is a
pitying Christ, whilst below here is a raging Antichrist: and although he may
be permitted to make a sea of blood in the earth; yet God has a sea of mercy
in heaven, to drown all the miseries and sins of his servants in.

Obj. Yea, but I do not know what I may suffer.

Answ. What, suppose the worst: can these part betwixt thy God and thee? can
thou suffer the loss of him, or of the thoughts of his mercy? no, no^^ who
shall separate, in this case^^ is the bold challenge of all be^^ lievers? Romans
8.35
why then guird up th^^ loins of thy mind: there i^^ hope and help enough:
thou an^ more happy then the world ca^ make thee: and thou shall never be
miserable, let the world d^ what it can to make thee so^ there is grace to be
revealed and brought to every believer by the hand and at the coming of Jesus
Christ: 1 Pet. 1.13.
this is enough to keep you above water, whatever your present condition be
there be thoughts of peace, and of mercy, the Lord make thy heart close with
himself; these will be brought out for the enriching and thy comfort in this
day, and thy day, of his redemption. Suck in then thy own consolation thou
believing soul, and rejoice in the Lord, whilst thou art sad and troubled in a
sinful and perplexed Kingdom: and say in the Spirit, well all this storm will
be over the Saints shall triumph: Jesus Christ shall be on the throne: his
enemies shall be disthroned and fall: for God has thoughts of peace toward
his people: he knows them all, and will bring them out, for he waits to be
gracious: in the fullness of time then there will be a fullness of mercy: and
in the mean time here remains a rest for the people of God to enter into: a
blessed Sanctuary of merciful thoughts in the bosom of our God, for the
succor of faithful ones: here take up thy rest, enter in, dwell, and delight
for evermore.

FINIS.
