THE NOBLE PAMPHLET, Or, a PIGS HEAD and a POPPET-PLAY, Provided for the Rebels
at WESTMINSTER, against this Bartholmew Fair: A Rattle for the Fool Fairfax,
half a bushel of Nuts for the Synod to crack, a new godly ballad for the
Saints of the Army, and a pair of sharp knives for the City.

By the Author of the winding sheet.

Draw back this leaf, and see discovered,
That which all this while has hovered:
Behind a cloud, here read and see,
The Iuntos, covert Treachery:
Fairfax his frauds, the Synods guile,
The Army's purpose all this while:
The Cities madness, see in short,
All this, and thank the Author for^.
Printed in the year 1648.

A Pigges-Head, and A POPPET-PLAY, Provided for the PARLIAMENT: against this
Bartholmew Fair.
PArdon, ye Rebels of either house, I ask you forgiveness, ere I cut your
throats, do you not wonder at it, i will tell you I intend to hang you in
effigy, till the wished for time arrive, that the substance supply the shadow,
and esteeming it no disparagement to my function, to be your executioner, I
observe the heads-mans custom for form sake, and superficially crave your
remission:

Thus do I kneel, thus beg, o cruel Turks,
Who defy Pluto, yet do all his works:
Most zealous Rebels, whom the whole world curses,
The blessed Reformers of our plate, and purses:
Geneva-Goblins, sent to fright our souls,
And quaffe our purple blood in mazor bowls:
Who love your Prince, so well you wish him dead.
That so a wreath of start might deck his head:
I do obsecrate you, ye fiend in clay,
No crimes upon my innocence to lay:
Not to be angry though J call you kna^es,
Cheaters, and murderers, villains, and slaves:
Not to be moved with ire, you know that I,
Am but the instrument of Destin^^
You had a plot upon the Poppets that should have adorned St. James his fair,
but it took not, for the tap-houses were erected, the mutton-mongers resorted,
the Curtezans were jumbled, the good fellows tipled, and the Ox was roasted,
cum privilegio, it is fair time with you all the year long, and therefore no
marvel if you envy all others profits, but I hope you will permit your
associates of the beloved City to make their mercats this next Bartholmew
Fair, you know the matter is between you and them, as between the letcher and
his whore, what he put in at the mouth goes out at the -- so what they gain by
their trades inricheth your purses, I have a strong faith that you will shut up
shop (...) Westminster for one day, and having laid aside the grand affairs of
cheating, and murdering the people spend some certain hours in recreation, I
am of the opinion, that it will much solace your tired spirits, whet your wits
to invent strange and unheard of stratagems, and quicken your greedy desire of
rule, I am confident you will come, and in certain assurance thereof have
provided you, a Piggs head, and a Poppet-play, hark in your ears.

It Is a Pig of one of these sowes, into whom your patron Pluto got, when he
hurried a whole heard violently into the sea, it shall be roasted before the
hot fire of Ambition, turned about by the Scismatick Sedition, basted by the
Patriarck Hypocrisy, the sauce shall be prepared by the fat cook Sacrilege,
it shall be usherd by the grave verger Policy, and served up by a penitent
Skelleton, called, Too late to Repent, after you have sufficiently eaten to
your content, I have devized a Poppet play, it is thus:

The Scene is England, the Actors are all Parliament Men, you may know them by
their robes, and the fearful characters written in their faces, they are
attended by whole troops of Committee-Cannibals, Excise-men, Messengers or,
Pettifoggers, Rogues, and R^scals, their (...) will be to work upon the giddy
spirits of the people, and to inveigh their floating brains, that the present
Government, burdensome Aristocraticall cruel and tyrannous, they will
underhand deal with them by their agents earnestly to petition, that failing
to threaten the ruin of their King and his posterity, unless he presently
yield his assent, for the satisfaction of their desires, the King beholding the
evils of their intents, for the preservation of his own, his Queen, and
childrens lives, leaves his chief Metropolis, and betakes himself to a place of
safety, his Parliament inwardly glad at his departure, petition the people to
petition them that the Government of the Church be altered that a most
incomparable Statesman, and a most unworthy pillar of the Church be put to
death, which is performed, the one prophesies, and the other preaches at the
scaffold, or place of execution, this bloody business over, they proceed to
take away the fundamental laws of the land, Root and branch, their King
perceiving their treacheries, declares against them, dubbing them with the due
epithites of Rebels and Traitors, the people deluded by their pretenses, cry
up their cause as the cause of Gods, Armies are by them immodiately levied, a
cuckoldly Lord chosen for their General, and all the land turned into a
confusion, their pious Prince (constrained thereto for his own safety) raises
forces to oppose them, the chief gentry of the land side with them, he fights
with the Rebels for the space of seven years, (to the exceeding decay of his
people, and to his great grief of Soul) yet at last might [according to the
proverb] overcomes right, he is totally subdued, and forced to fly for shelter
amongst his own Countrymen, they unworthily desert him, and return him into
his enemies hand for money, they clap him up close prisoner, and like base
villains, make a mock at his misery, he is beaten and receives a black eye,
of his jailor, a slave, (whom ere this play conclude) I present unto you torn
to pieces by dogs, in the mean time the earth is made drunk with the blood of
Innocents prodigally shed by command of the Rebels, all order and discipline is
taken away, the ministers of God are murdered and silenced, and mechanic
Scums, viz. Tailers, weavers, and mopmakers, take upon them the sacred function
of the ministry, and infect the people, with nonsense, blasphemy, and Treason,
while the Rebels squeeze out the hearts bloods of the poor Communality, by
taxations, excise, contributions, loanes, plunders, and free quarter, and
fatten themselves inmischief wallowing in all excess of riot, impoverishing
the nation, and cramming their own bags till they strut again, and in hope to
take away Monarchical Government, and to make themselves (...) State, they
vote they will settle the kingdom without their King, neither make any
addresses to him, or receive any message from him, the people perceiving into
what a bondage they are brought become as zealous haters as before they were
lovers of the Rebels, they begin to cogitate the happy days they enjoyed under
the^r most gracious King, and curse themselves that ere they rebelled against
him, resolving to pull down these tyrants, whom they had advanced, and [if it
be possible] to recover their King, lost laws and liberties, they generally
rise, threatening vengeance against their bloody oppressors, who to defer
their punishment, vote that they will treat with their King, the people see it,
and laugh at their gullery, and perfidious hypocrisy, they fetch their King to
London, with all honor and due respects, ceaze on the Rebels, and clap them in
the dungeon, restore their King to his rights, and surrender them to the
gallows, this is the plot of the play I intend to present you with, the
Poppets are set on screwes, and have their motion by a crabbed fellow, called,
the Crittick observer, they are presented by Fame, and their several morions
explained by truth.

How like you this, this cannot sure affright you,
Alas you know I study to delight you.
I am not without hopes, but Tom Fairfax will make a shift to halt to this
Fair, to make merry with your memberships, I have provided the traiterous
fool a rattle, which I will thus bestow upon him.

Degenerate villain, perjured slave,
Thou monstrous Ass, (yet cunning knave)
Cursed in thy mothers womb, who brought,
A firebrand forth, thou that have sought:
To strike thy King, and nation dead,
Ore them in triumph for to tread:
Who with thy sword do justify,
The Rebels in their Treachery:
Yet at St. Albans once did swear,
To God, thy King, and all were there,
For to supplant the Rebels hopes.
And for to pull out all their props:
To be the thunderbolt of Fate,
And Charles thy Lord, to re-instate,
Thy ruine's near, which all shall see,
Mean time, take this [forc'd gift] of me.
Nor are the Synodicall simplicians (I hope so Stoicall, but they will be
pleased also, to accompany your grand Rebelships in this invitation, come be
not nice, we know, ye hypocrites, that you have fat whores, as well as larded
benefices, and prefer your God belly, before the Almighty Jehovah, you knew
well enough that the outing of the Bishops from their Sees, would prove your
entrance into wealthy livings, while those who formerly enjoyed them, whose
learning and Loyalty pronounces them worthy of honors and profits, wander
about the kingdom like forlorn wretches, languish in prison or beg their
daily bread of men, I have a thing within me, whispers you will come, against
which time, I have provided you half a bushel of such Nuts as these to crack:

The first will prove a terror to your teeth, it is this, whether or no th^r^wout
the whole Book of God, there be any warrant, any one president or colorable
example, that a Subject [without the hazard of Soule] may rise in actual
Rebellion against his Sovereign, upon any pretense, or for the attaining of
any end [tend it nere so much to the glory of God, and his Countries welfare
[and whether the Rebels at Westminster, who have pretended both yet have
performed neither, are not liable, therefore to punishment here, and hereafter?

Whether your selves ought to be censured even to agravation, for convening
your selves together in opposition to the Bishops Government, yea, whether you
ought not to have your ears naild for perjury, in that you have, [contrary to
your oaths taken at the time of your commencement, and when you received
Orders] been the principal authors of the Bishops ejectment, and the stirrers
up of the people against the Book of Co^mon-Prayer, with the decent rites, and
necessary Ceremonies of the Church?

Thirdly, Whether he that fears not God, can honor the King, (I mean
knowingly, and as a Christian ought) and whether he that honors the King [in
order aforesaid] can be other thou a fearer of God.

These are the prime Nuts, pray crack them first;
Then take the rest, and feed until you burst.
But (for that I know) the black Saints of the Army are not at leisure to leave
Colchester as yet, I shall not expect their company at the Fair, but as a
tender of my love, I send them this Ballad, which I would have them sing, to
the tune of a Song, J writ some years since called, I would if I could.

England.
Most blessed knaves,
Who dig the graves:
For Loyalty and reason,
You errant holy Zealots,
Who hug [the varlet] Treason.
Shall virtue suffer still,
England unto your will:
Shall plunderers bear sway,
And Loyalty obey.
Army.
Weel nere assen^, our Parliament
Shall be adjou^^ed quite,
For who shall vote us money,
As it is most requisite,
Weel rule you all by force,
While we are foot and horse:
Your wives, your goods are ours,
Inthral^ into our powers.
England.
Therefore ye goats,
Weel cut your throats,
And ^ead you swift to h^ll:
For a^^ your Base projections,
No age can paral^^^.
Weel mince you to the pot,
And hang you up by lo^:
Your ^^ly hides weel ore.
And kill you, ore and ore.
My tame wittols of the City, I am certainly assured to have store of you at
this Fair, with your Fair wives in your wooden houses, and for you, for that
I find now that you begin somewhat to be reformed clean contrary to the
intents of your Reformers, after you have wearied your selves in iniquity you
are now sat down to count your gains and find you have accrewed nothing but
iron in your wounds and gunpowder in your nostrils, having exchanged your
liberty for slavery, your King for Tyrants, your God for Besial, and your
honor for shame, I say since I see you have now found your error, and resolve
no longer to be ridden and exhausted, I shall bestow upon you these pair of
knives.

They are exceedingly well tempered and of an exquisite form, fashioned by a
most accomplished Artist, called, Self Preservation, with one of them I should
have you to cut holes in the skins of those desperate and bloody Sectaries of
the Army, as also of those under the conduct of the Treacherous Saint Skippon,
all whom are engaged by oath to rob and plunder you, in case you shall not join
with them in their damnable intents, for the deposing the King, for extirpating
the Nobility, for the setting up of a boundles Independency, and for the
attaining a parrity without nomination.

With the other I would have you to salute the Rebels of the lower House, as
Ioab did Abner, and to be of the same mind that Ireton once was of [when the
Army and you were at difference] to purge and purge, and never leave purging
the Houses, till you quite root out all the Regecides, and bloody destroyers
there.

That don, with speed to search the land,
And stab all Traitors out of hand:
Then to bring home your King in Peace,
All hostile actions for to cease:
Place him in throne, the Church restore,
Unto her Pastors as before t
Recover your lost laws age^,
Which don, be happy joyful men.
FINIS.
