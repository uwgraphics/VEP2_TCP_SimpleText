AN ACCOUNT OF THE Decree of the University of Oxford, against some Heretical
Tenets.
At a Meeting of Mr. Vice Chancellor, and the Heads of Colleges and Halls, in
the University of Oxford, the 25th of November, 1695.
UPon occasion of a Sermon lately Preached before the University of Oxford, in
the Church of St. Peter's in the East, on the Feast of St. Simon and Jude last
past, these words amongst others, were publicly spoken and asserted, viz.
[There are Three Infinite distinct Minds and Substances in the Trinity,] Item
[That the Three Persons in the Trinity are Three distinct Infinite Minds or
Spirits, and Three Individual Substances,] which words gave many Persons just
cause of offense and scandal.

Mr. Vice Chancellor, and the Heads of Colleges and Halls, being now met
together in their General Meeting, Judge, Declare, and Decree, that the
foresaid words are false, Impious, and Heretical; disagreeing and contrary to
the Doctrine of the Catholic Church, and especially to the Doctrine of the
Church of England, publicly received.

Wherefore they order, and strictly enjoin, all, and several of the Persons
committed to their Trust and Care, that for the future they do not maintain any
such Positions in their Sermons, or elsewhere.

By the Decree of Mr. Vice Chancellor, and the Heads of Houses.

Ben. Cooper, Notary Public, and Register to the University of Oxford.
It may be noted, That the Propositions abovementioned, are Dr. S -- k's, in
his Discourse of the Trinity, and the Defenders of it; and wrote against by the
Animadverter, etc.
