Jus Regum. OR, A VINDICATION OF THE REGAL POWERS, etc.
IT is not safe to judge another, yet if the tree may be known by the fruit,
and the secret and hidden disposition of the heart, by words which proceed out
of a man's mouth; then my Lord of Canterbury his actions being considered, and
his last Speech examined, he may be judged otherwise, then according to that
verdict which he has pronounced of himself in that his last Speech: but to
pass by his actions, but as they shall only occasionally interveen, we will
examine his Speech, without wresting it to a worse sense then of necessity it
must bear; and as all is not gold that glisters, so upon review and
examination, it will not be found to be so charitable, as by some positive
affirmations it pretends to be, and all along the Reasons enforcing will be
found contradicting those affirmative conclusions expressed therein, whether they
intend himself or others; for of himself, a great deal of humility and charity
is affirmed, when much presumption and want of charity may be collected. For
presumption, his speech is full of it, and chiefly in his comparisons and
instances: for first he compares his Innocence with reference to his
sufferings, to Christ's, in these words, that Jesus despised the shame for him,
God forbid but he should despise the shame for Jesus. In which words, is
employed, that as Christ's sufferings in regard of himself were undeserved, so
were his sufferings without any just cause on his part, but that his ignominy
and shame was no less for Christ's sake, and for his fidelity to Christ, then
Christ's sufferings were for his love to mankind; and from thence concludes,
that his hope was, that God was bringing him to the land of Promise, in regard
he was to pass through the Red sea, alluding to his suffering by the effusion
of his blood: but he could not be ignorant that it was causa non paena that
makes the Martyr; and therefore his argument will only hold if his cause were
just, and that he suffered undeservedly: but if otherwise, his passage through
the Red sea, or his forced passage out of this world by a violent death, will
prove but a weak argument, that God was therefore bringing him to a land of
Promise, for then no death, so desirable as a violent death, if it were a
concluding argument that therefore, he who is forced to suffer, is entering into
a land of Promise. Neither does his next instance conclude better, that because
the Passover was to be eaten with sour herbs, that therefore his present
sufferings (which he confesses that in regard of his weakness and infirmity
of flesh and blood, were unpleasing and unwelcome unto him) should by their
resemblance into sour herbs, prove, his forced submission unto death to be
either a Passover or a willing submission to the will of God: for whosoever
submits only to the will of God when he cannot otherwise choose, submits not
to the will of God, but is compelled by necessity. And by the words following,
it appears plainly, that whatsoever he affirmed to the contrary, yet was he
angry with the hands that gathered those herbs, or brought him to that place to
suffer.

And out of all question had it been as much in his power to have prevented
their purposes, by executing of vengeance, as it had been formerly to inflict
punishment on those who did profess any dislike against his and other the
Prelates unwarrantable usurpations, nothing on his part should have been
referred to the justice of God, but if he himself could not call down fire from
heaven to consume them, he would have raised a persecution upon earth to
scourge them. But the date of his power was now expired, yet did his
indignation remain which he did not conceal, but when he could do no more he
did think it fit to put the good people in mind, that when the servants of God,
old Israel, were in this boisterous Sea and Aaron with them, the Egyptians
which persecuted them, and did in a manner drive them into that Sea, were
drowned in the same waters, while they were in pursuit of them; and he knows,
his God whom be served, is as able to deliver him from this sea of blood, as he
was to deliver the 3 Children from the furnace, Dan. 3. In which words are
employed two things; the first is hope of vengeance from God on those that did
prosecute him. The second is hope of a temporal deliverance to himself. The
first argues want of charity; the second implies want of true faith, or
which is equivalent an erroneous faith.

And what is employed here is evidenced in the words following, by which he most
humbly thanks his Savior, that his resolution was now as theirs was then;
their resolution was, that they would not worship the Image which the King had
set up, nor shall be the imaginations which the people are setting up, nor will
forsake the Temple and truth of God, to follow the bleating of Jeroboams Calves
in Dan and in Bethel. Where nothing is or can be clearer, then the manifest
difference and dissimilitude between the different conditions of the several
parties proposed, and from the result, the grounds of his faith will appear.
For the 3. Children, to whom he does resemble himself, were merely passive,
preferring a passive sufferance before any actual obedience, to unlawful and
prohibited Idolatry: Whereas on the contrary, he was brought to that place of
execution, for his active introducing of real changes in the worship of God,
expressly against the Word of God, and the Laws of the Land. For by the Word of
God, we are taught that we must not make to our selves any graven Image, nor
the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, nor in the earth beneath,
nor in the waters under the earth, to bow down to them, and worship them: and
we are moreover taught by the same Word, that the Judicial and Ceremonial Law
being fulfilled by the death of Christ, all external worshipping of God,
arising from any Commandment either of God or man, is in it self inacceptable
before God, and therefore superfluous and needless: If not first springing
from a true and lively faith, begetting true holiness and inward
sanctification, and by consequence only, external reverence and worship, and
therefore the chief duty of the Ministers of the Gospel, is by information and
instruction to beget in the people true knowledge as a foundation of sound
belief, from whence only springs true faith; and then to incite them to
external duties, as evidences of their faith, but have no commission from the
Word of God to enjoin or command any external duties, but to exhort only to
the performance of those which were commanded and ordained by God himself:
neither had they ever any spiritual authority committed unto them for the
enforcing of obedience unto any thing that should be ordained by themselves:
For the Apostles never had, nor never exercised any such authority. In brief,
the sum of all is briefly thus, that as under the Law, all bowing down to any
graven Image, and the worshipping of God in the likeness of any thing in
heaven or in earth was Idolatry: So under the Gospel, which was the end and
consummation of the Law, all external worship of God that does not spring from
faith, as from the root, is to be accounted Idolatry, as being a counterfeit
worship set up by the imagination of men, not according to the will of God. And
my Lord of Cant. does here in some sort acknowledge this for a truth, but
removes the guilt from himself to lay it upon the people; for here he does
account the worshipping of God according to the imaginations of the people to
be Idolatry; but does not consider that what he esteemed Idolatry in them,
might be in himself. If he could produce no better warrant then his own
imaginations, for with God there is no respect of persons; but then the
question will be, whether he was brought to that place to suffer, for refusing
to submit to that idolatry, which here he affirms was setting up by the
people, or for imposing upon them a will worship according to his own
imaginations only? And if he himself had given the answer, he could not say
that the people did impose any thing upon him in the worship of God, but it was
apparent and undeniable that he did upon the people: for doing whereof he
neglected his Ministerial Office consisting chiefly in Information,
Instruction, and Exhortation; thereby to convince the conscience, which is
incapable of constraint from the authority of man, and usurped an authority
which is only peculiar to God, and cannot be communicated to man: for which
the people notwithstanding were not his Judges, but the Law of the Land,
against which he did no less transgress, for imposing upon the people any
thing by a lawless authority not warranted by the Laws, then he did offend
against the Word of God by usurping a spiritual authority not warranted in the
Word. For the Law of the Land restrains the making of all Laws and
constitutions, and the imposing of any new thiug upon the Subjects of this
Kingdom, to the Authority of Parliaments; And albeit the Clergy might assemble
in Convocation, yet were all their Acts and Constitutions of no force nor
validity, until confirmed and ratified by Parliament: whereas my Lord of
Canterbury did not only innovate many things in the worship of God, but did
introduce and impose many new things in the Church by his own authority, and in
the State by his credit with the King by the Regal Power, directly against the
Laws of the Kingdom, for which he was at that time brought upon the Scaffold to
suffer, not because he did prefer a passive sufferance before an actual
obedience to unlawful and prohibited Idolatry as did the 3. Children; but
because he did exact obedience from others to his lawless commands, without
any warrant from the Word of God, nor from the Laws of the Land, but by an
usurped authority over both: wherefore his case can no ways be compared to the
3. Childrens, but without any injury done to him, he may justly be taxed with
presumption for his paralels or comparisons.

And as his presumptions are notorious, so is his want of charity manifest,
notwithstanding his seeming professions to the contrary, as appears in his
next Section, which he begins with a charitable prayer, That God would
bless all this people, and open their eyes, that they may see the right way.
The which his charity does terminate and end in himself, which is not charity,
for charity extends chiefly to others; and the inference which he makes,
does discover the sum of his desires for a blessing upon this people, for the
opening of their eyes to be chiefly meant, that they might see and acknowledge
his Innocence which he does here present to their consideration, not obscurely
employed, but positively affirmed against all accusation whatsoever by the
attestation of his own conscience: Having upon this occasion ransacked every
corner of his heart, where he has not found any of his sins that are there,
deserving death by the known Laws of the Land. Certainly he was not, nor could
he be so ignorant, as here he pretends to be innocent; for he could not choose
but know that it was death by the known Laws of this Kingdom, for any Subject
to innovate against the established Government. But supposing there had been no
positive Law against it, yet was it to have been esteemed an unpardonable crime
deserving the most rigorous of deaths for any Subject to attempt it; no less
then it had been in an Athenian to murder his own father, when the Laws were
silent for the punishment, as presupposing no such crime would be committed:
nor could his conscience be so seared as not to dictate unto him, that he was
the adviser to the King, needlessly to assume an arbitrary power, for the
introducing of many things, whereof he himself was the chief Author, against
the known Laws of the Land. And if nothing else had been proved, yet one thing
was so manifest, that it needed no proof at all, the assuming of a Legislative
power, by making of Laws and Constitutions in a Provincial Assembly, binding
to the whole Subjects, and Clergy in general, to be enforced by Spiritual
Authority or Ecclesiastical censures; and imposing a general tax upon the
Clergy without any confirmation but of the Kings Letters Patents, which was a
manifest usurpation over the consciences of men, and a breach against the
fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, the King himself having no such power nor
prerogative, and former Kings having never assumed it; besides the cheat which
he did put upon the King in persuading his Majesty to establish that by his
Prerogative, which was not only derogatory, but destructive to his
Prerogative, as shall be opened more pertinently hereafter; and yet he would
here persuade the people he dies innocently, not deserving death. For which
his undeserved sentence, notwithstanding he is so charitable, as to charge
nothing, not in the least degree upon his Judges, for they are to proceed by
proof, by valuable witnesses, and in that way he or any Innocent in the world
may justly be condemned.

If he had ended here, it had been against charity not to believe him; but as
fire cannot long be concealed, after it has taken hold any combustible matter,
but will break forth and appear: So the fire of his indignation against his
Judges, being kindled in his breast, must needs break forth in despite of
dissimulation, and his next words demonstrate clearly what opinion he had of
his Judges, whom he compares to the Danes when Heathens, to the fury of Wat
Tyler, and his fellows, to the malice of a lewd woman, to a persecuting Sword,
and lastly to Herod, and to the persecuting Jews, and makes the charge against
himself to look like that against St. Paul, in the 25. of the Acts, and against
St. Stephen in the 6. of the Acts. To whose cases his had no more resemblance
then it had to the 3. Childrens; for St. Paul and St. Stephen, were persecuted
for opening the kingdom of heaven, by showing a clear way to enter therein, by
a true and lively faith, grounded upon the death and mediation of Jesus Christ
only, without any reference to our selves, and our own merits. But he on the
contrary did what in him lay to shut the kingdom of heaven to such as was
desirous to enter, directing them into false ways, such as could never bring a
man thither. For if the old Israelites, by following after the Law of
righteousness attained not into the Law of righteousness, because they sought
it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law, Romans 9. 31, 32. and
therefore were excluded from the promises; what must become of them, who going
about to establish not the righteousness of the Law, which once was the
ordinance of God, but a righteousness of their own prescription, consisting
for the most part in external rites and ceremonies, commanding the observation
of them as the principal part of Gods worship and of man's duty; when in the
mean time they neglect the ordinance of God which is their Ministerial office,
consisting chiefly in reforming of the will, and informing the understanding,
by the operation of the Word preached, which may be performed by Information
and Instruction; but can never by any authority or command, for there is a vast
difference between him, who endeavors the production of desired effects by
the operation of necessary and appointed means, and him who commands only the
performance of the like effects, without the application of such means as are
necessary: for the one requires an omnipotent power; the other may be
performed by a creature of a finite capacity. What affinity or resemblance then
can my Lord of Canterburies case have with St. Paul's or St. Stephens, who
suffered under the rage of the people for offering their pains, to show them
only, a clear and infallible way for purchasing the kingdom of heaven, which
was left to their own choice to believe or not believe? But my Lord of Cant.
neglecting the ways of St. Paul and St. Stephen, (consisting only in
demonstration and in the efficacy of persuasion for the obtaining of their
purposes and ends) was legally processed and condemned, for making use of
external force, and compulsion for the obtaining of his, which St. Paul nor
St. Stephen never did: and moreover, he having screwed himself into the favor
of the King, did make the Regal Power isntrumental to his ends, and (which
among other things is inexcusable) did endeavor to lay the odium and obloquy
of all upon the King when it could not otherwise be defended; as if that had
been sufficient, that he was only isntrumental to the Kings commands, when it
was too well known that he was the director of those commands. And as his case
differed from theirs in the means, so must it differ likewise in the ends, for
the end of all their labor and pains, was to bring men in subjection to the
will of God, by declaring unto them the power of God and of the Deity, and
manifesting the inexpressible love of God to mankind, in sending his only
begotten Son into the world to take upon him our humane nature, and expounding
unto them the virtue and efficacy of Christ's death and resurrection; but the
end of his labor and pains, was to bring men in subjection to his own will, by
making them sensible how dangerous it was to offend him. For he took more pains
to inflict punishment on such as offended him, then to instruct such as were
ignorant.

But odious is his next comparison, comparing himself with Christ, and his
accusers to the Pharisees, who having accused Christ for fear, that if they did
let him alone, all men would believe on him, and the Romans would come and take
away both their place and Nation. Concluding from thence, with a prayer to God,
that God would not reward this people as then he did the Jews for their
causlesse fears and unjust sentence; but the cases being so different, and the
comparisons so odious, it were a superfluous labor to go about to inform any
man's understanding in the discovery. Nor needs any time be spent in detecting
his vain presumption, and arrogant boasting in applying that deserved triumph
of Saint Paul to himself, as if he could no less truly, then Saint Paul did,
say, by honor and dishonor, by good report, and evil report, as a deceiver
and yet true, he was now passing out of this world, for it is manifest that he
coveted and courted that honor, which Saint Paul accounted but loss and dung,
and did run a clear contrary course to Saint Paul, for Saint Paul accounted
it no shame, To the weak to become as weak, 1 Cor. 9. 28.
that he might gain the weak* nor to be made all things to all men, that he
might by all means save some, but he accounted it not only a shame but an
indignity, to condescend one jot to the weakness of any man, and rather then
he should be crossed in his purpose and will, those gifts and abilities,
which God had bestowed upon him, for other purposes and ends, and that credit
and esteem which he had purchased with his Majesty, by those gifts and
abilities, and in reverence of the holiness of his calling, should be all
employed to engage King and Kingdom in a War, as was evident by the War with
Scotland, especially after the first pacification at the camp near Barwicke.

But having taken all this pains in a general justification of himself to the
people, who were his Auditors at length he thinks of it not amiss to speak of
some particulars, and first is he bold to speak of the King, who he says has
bin much traduced by some for laboring to bring in Popery, which he might
truly affirm, If any such affirmation had been made of His Majesty but the
truth hereof is prevaricated as other truths are by him, and made useof, for
his own justification rather then for the Kings, the King being rather aspersed
then justified by such manner of justification, for no man did ever affirm
that the King was a Papist as is here employed, nor that His Majesty did labor
to bring in Popery as is here affirmed, but that he was overreached by the
subtilty and fraud of some, and he himself esteemed the principal deceiver
and undermyner of the King, and it always has been one of his chiefest
subtilties, so to confound the Kings actions and his own, that they could not
easily be distinguished, that by so doing he might never be reached but by
wounding the King first, building thereby great hopes, if not assured
confidence to escape himself, and here laboring to justify himself to the
People, from having ever had any intention to introduce Popery, he purposly
makes mention of the King, for whose purposes and intentions he might safely
take any deep Protestation, as if that conduced much to clear himself in the
opinion of his Auditors (which was the chief thing he now aimed at) of all
practices tending to that end, as a thing impossible for him to bring about,
without the concurrent consent of the King, which was but a fancy but no solid
argument necessarily concluding what he would have believed, for the work
might be advancing, without any discovery in the King, that it was necessarily
tending to such an end, until such time that it should be too late, if not
impossible to retire, as a Dear may be driving into a toil, not suspecting
any danger, but having leisure at some times to feed by the way, until such
time as seeing and apprehending his own danger, by being unawares reduced to
such a straight as does leave him no variety of choice, but to place his only
safety and means of escape in leapping into that snare which had been prepared
for him, and to which much pains had been taken to drive him; for it is not to
be imagined, that either his Majesty or any other Christian King, should
submit themselves to the bondage of Popery if they rightly understood what they
did, for (to pass by the danger which it brings to their souls, by leading
them into by-pathes of error which can never bring them to heaven,) it
subjects all temporal authority into a vassalage and subordination to its
spiritual, and that not so much by any accident or contingency arising from
the different dispositions of the several persons who sit upon the several
thrones spiritual and temporal (which may be turbulency and ambition in the
one, and infirmity and weakness in the other) as by the very principles and
Fundamental constitution of Popery, by reason of the acknowledgement of, and
submission into a spiritual authority, being once rooted and firmly fixed in
the belief or imagination by all who embrace it, and the natural effects
which do necessarily spring from thence; For when the world was blinded by
ignorance as by darkness, at what time the Popes did sit as God in the Temple
of God and by their spiritual authority in excommunicating and absolving whom
they pleased, and for what they pleased, did uncontrollably oppose and exalt
themselves above all that is called God, that is above all Magistracy and power
in earth: What lamentable and sad effects, did Christendom groan under and
feel from such transcendent and omnipotent a Power, so long as from a general
belief, it was universally submitted unto? But when men's eyes began once to be
opened, and by the clear light of the truth revealed in Scripture, some men did
clearly see and perceive that no such power was ever, nor could be given into
any one man upon earth, yet the apprehension of such a power and authority,
that it was given unto some, being sunk deeply into all men's understandings,
great difference did arise where the same should reside, and all men
acknowledging it to appertain to the Clergy only, did place it amongst them as
it were by a general consent, in some one of those forms which are known to
be best capable to preserve authority, all or the most part of all concluding
that it must be preserved in one of them, each embracing and submiting into
that form, which was preferred and made choice of by those who bare the
greatest sway, or had the greatest esteem and reputation with them, but none of
them foreseeing into all effects and events which might follow, has bin the
chief cause why so much discord and contention has risen and continued, which
will never be wanting so long as the cause remains, that is, until it be
clearly understood what the pow-of the Church, and of Churchmen is, whether any
such thing as spiritual authority does appertain to them, and by what right,
and to what end, whether or no, it be conducing to Religion, or be compatible
with the end of government, for albeit there be no such thing as spiritual
authority acknowledged, yet all power is not thereby taken away from the
Church, but the consequence will only be, that the power of the Church, and of
Churchmen, is no more then opperative, and declarative, not at all
authoritative, and having no authority, they can have no legislative power of
making Laws and constitutions, (call them by what name soever they will)
binding to the conscience, having no penalties to enforce obedience; and why
should any such thing as spiritual authority be admitted to be when it cannot
be evidenced what execution does follow, for authority without execution
cease to be authority by losing its virtue, for if authority say to one go,
he must go, or to another come, he must come, and likewise to a third, do
this, he must do it, but no Clergy man nor Minister of the Gospel can say,
enter thou into heaven, and go thou into hell, all he can say is, thus
believe and do, and thou shall be saved, but if otherwise you will be damned,
but both the doing and believing depends upon the hearers own choice,
nothing is determined by the appointment of the Minister, all that rests in the
power of the Minister is to declare to others, the effectual means of their
salvation, from the revealed will of God, to which whosoever submits by a
voluntary profession testifying his belief, and receiving of baptism which is
the seal of his belief, but brings not forth fruit according to his
Profession, and walks not according to the rules set down in Scripture, and
will not be convinced nor reclaimed by no admonition nor reproof, then may the
Minister safely and boldly pronounce that he is still in the state and
condition of an Infidel and unbeleever, no more capable of any thing that may
accrue unto him by the death and mediation of Christ then a heathen or pagane,
and therefore may debar him from admission into the holy Communion, which is,
or ought to be, the Communion of Saints or true believers, and is Gods
Sacrament to us, that is to say his Covenant and seal unto us, of the fruits
and benefits, that we hope for hereafter, by virtue of Christ's death and
resurrection, but the party offending is not presently cast into hell by that
sentence, and though hell fire may follow upon it hereafter, yet is it not the
Ministers sentence, nor the debarring him srom the Sacrament, that does send
him thither, but his want of faith, which is made evident and nortorious, by no
single act of any declared sin, but by an obstinate perserverance in any one
sin or more that has been judged already by the unappealable judgment of God,
to be an evidence of want of faith in him who commits it, and does take
pleasure and delight into it, which is made manifest and apparent to men by a
perseverance in it only; and therefore it is the sentence of God, and not of
the Minister, the Minister being only Gods Herald or messenger to declare to
others the revealed will of God, and for doing thereof he has an express
warrant from God recorded in Scripture; nor must it be any part of the
Ministers purpose to send any man to hell (but purpose and intention of doing
execution upon the offender is essential to authority and inseparable from it)
but only to prevent (what in him lies) his going thither: for albeit that the
Ministers sentence, being rightly pronounced, be ratified in heaven, (which is
undeniable) yet may it be recalled again, but never at the Ministers will and
pleasure (which at sometimes is incident to authority) but by the contrition
and repentance of the obstinate party publicly promising, and vowing his
amendment, upon which evidence the Minister may pronounce his absolution
receiving him again into the bosom of the Church, and admit him again into
the Communion of Saints, and this sentance is likewise ratifyed in Heaven, If
the parties repentance be unfeigned and sincere, which notwithstanding may be
hypocritical and dissembled in him, albeit he does refrain and forbear from
the performance of that wherein he gave the offense and scandal, and does
moreover proceed to amendment of his life, not only in that particular, but
does walk unblameably and without any deserved reproof from the judgment of
men in all other, howsoever upon a visible purpose of amendment, the Minister
not only may, but must receive him again into the bosom of the Church, and
admit him again into the holy Communion with others, so that nothing is left
to the will of the Minister, nor to the final judgment of the Minister, but
all is referred to the will and knowledge of God, and where will and knowledge
are excluded, their Authority is wanting, and though much may be effected and
brought to pass by them, yet whatsoever is effected deserves not the name as
differing from the nature of Authority: and the Ministers of Christ having no
Authority in those things wherein they cannot ere so long as they follow the
clear light revealed in Scripture, they can much less have any Authority for
such things which flow from their own Invention, nor can they enforce
obedience by any spiritual means or censures of the Church, unto any thing
whereof they themselves are Authors, when no spiritual means are compulsive
in regard of the Instrument that must apply them, and whatsoever efficacy or
virtue they have, yet may they never be applied for the enforcing of any thing
whereof man is Author, for then it would follow that the will of man or
something proceeding from the will of man would be a rule to the Justice of
God, when one man must be as a Publican, or Heathen and consequently incapable
of the fruits of Christ's death, for disobeying only the will, or something
depending upon the will of another, which no man dares to affirm, and having
no compulsive means to enforce obedience, they can have no legislative power
of making of cannons and constitutions binding to the conscience, for a law
without a penalty or power sufficient to enforce it, is no law, nor need they
have any such power, for such a power is not conducible at all to that end of
Religion which is committed to them, and to their care and pains, but is
destructive to the end of government; for Religion has a two fold end, the one
respects God, the other man, the end of religion in respect of God is to
glorify God, that man who was therefore created to glorify his Maker should by
a true knowledge of the true God glorify him aright, and the end of religion in
respect of man, is to bring a man from all confidence in himself or the
creature, to rely upon the Providence and goodness of God who is the Creator,
to the end he may renounce his own righteousness to be made partaker of the
merits and Righteousness of the Son of God, the Redeemer of Mankind, that
by faith in him he may obtain grace and some measure of sanctification in this
life, for the remission of sins, and fruition of Glory hereafter: and for
this end of religion no humane laws do contribute any thing at all, for unto
this the Scriptures are sufficient being complete in themselves, and the
chief duty of the Ministers of the Gospel is to explain and expound the true
meaning of scripture to others, for doing whereof they should be learned in all
necessary learning and skillful, as also have a lawful Calling by a lawful
Ordination, and for which it is very fit that they be set apart from all other
employment, and have a sufficient maintenance that they may the better attend
that to which they are called; but for the other end to glorify God, humane
laws do contribute much, but they are required of Christian Kings and
Magistrates, and not of Christian Ministers, for God did from the beginning put
Authority into the hands of the Magistrate, and endowed them with effectual
means for enforcing of obedience to what should be commanded by them, so did
he never in the hands of the Priests and Levites under the Law, nor of the
Apostles under the Gospel, and by consequence into the hands of no Ministers
whatsoever succeeding them, and God does require of the Magistrate to improve
his Authority (which is the talent that God has given him) for the gaining of
others by force and compulsion, (when no other means will prevail) to the
performance of those duties that are required of them, as he requires of all
who are called to labor in the Ministerial function and office, to employ
their gifts and graces (which are the talents bestowed upon them) painfully and
dilligently for the enlightening of the understanding of others, whereby every
exalted thought and imagination may be brought down, which the Magistrates
Power and Authority can never reach, for the Power of the Magistrate reaches
no further then to the outward life and conversation, when the operation of the
Ministry subdueth the will, and therefore the principal care of the Magistrate
is and ought to be to enforce men to live uprightly and justly as they ought to
do, for by so doing men glorify God, but this is not all, the glory that is to
be performed by man to God, for besides there must be a ready submission to the
Will of God, springing from a perfect love to God, and grounded upon an assured
confidence of Gods love to us, which may be begotten and kindled in a man, but
can never be enforced, and to this duty tends the Ministers pains and
labor, but it is and ought to be the Christian Magistrates care to provide for
all that can only be introduced by force and compulsion in the Service of God,
wherefore the several ends of Magistracy and of the Ministry are different but
not contrary, but the several means by which they attain their ends are not
only different but contrary, and those means which are effectual to the one,
are not only ineffectuall but useless to the other, for the Magistrate can
never attain that end to which his Authority conduces by no perswation nor
information only, nor can the Minister subdue the will nor inform the
understanding by any Authority from or in himself, and both of them have their
Commission immediately from God, and each of them are subject to the other
without any subordination of offices from the one to the other, for the
Magistrate is no less subject to the operation of the word from the mouth of
the Minister then any other man whatsoever, and the Minister again is as much
subject to the Authority of the Magistrate as any other Subject whatsoever, and
therefore though there be no subordination of offices, yet is there of Persons,
the Person of the Minister remaining a Subject, but not the function of the
Ministry, but there needs not two Tribunalls nor Independent Courts be erected
to provide for their several ends and duties required of them, for the
Minister can never attain the end of his labors, by no Judicial process nor
legal proceedings whatsoever, and therefore all Judicial courts are
needelesse and useless to his ends, yet are they not so to himself having
other ends then what are required of him for the discharge of his duty and
function, but it is essential to the Magistrate to have a tribunal and
judicial Courts, for the attaining of his ends and duties required of him,
without which he can never discharge his duty as he ought, but whenever the
like Tribunal is erected in the Church as is necessary in the State, they must
be Independent one of another in regard the several offices governing Church
and State are so, but all that is to be got by Independent Tribunalls, is
either dissension and discord, which is the usual fruit that devision of
Authority bears, or by compliance to provide for one another Interests, or
particular ends differing from their public duties, with the manifest loss of
true religion on both sides, which many times draws down the Judgment of God
upon one or both, as being a third person no less interressed in Justice and
Honor then either, and many times the Justice of God is most greeveous when
least apprehended, as suffering men to wallow in their sins to dye in security,
nor is it a small Judgment to leave men to the necessary effects, which
division of Authority produces: for the end of all government is the
preservation of humane society, the means of doing whereof is by union and
unity, and Authority is the effectual means of producing and propagating
unity? and therefore whenever Authority is divided, Unity may always, and
sometimes must admit of division which destroys it, for unity and division are
destructive one of another, and when two Tribunalls are erected for the
determining of several and different causes and crimes, both armed with a
forcible Authority, weilding swords of a different nature, agreeable to their
different constitutions, and without any dependency and subordination the one
to the other, what lasting concord and agreement can there be beweene these
two, they that manage them must be juster then men are known to be, or
advantages will be taken when given by the one, (as no sublunary substances
which are subject to change can remain long in an equal balance) for
subjecting the other; and therefore it was, when the Christian world did by a
general consent believe that the Church having a sword though invisible, for
the cutting off of all schismatic and refractory Members, no less really
and truly then the State has a visible material sword, which for the
preservation of union and unity, was esteemed necessary to be put into the
hands of one, and therefore willingly submitted their necks, under the
Imaginary stroke thereof, from the sentence of Popes, or Bishops of Rome; How
easy was it for them by reason thereof to subject all Christian Princes and
Magistrates unto a dependency and subordination unto them and their Authority,
and how did they trouble the Christian world, by transferring of rights and
stirring up of rebellion whenever any of those Princes did oppose them, or
contradict their wills by a supposed Intrenching upon their pretended
Prerogatives though usurped* but when the Popes right began to be questioned by
some, whereby his reputation did decline, even amongst those who adhearing
still to the doctrine of the Church of Rome as to that in which they had been
educated and bred, yet did not believe his censures to be so dreadful as
before they apprehended them to be; but the edge of his sword being thereby
blunted, and the edge of the temporal sword being not only visible but
sharp, the advantage returned to Princes, whereby those Princes who continued
in union with the Church of Rome, professing subjection and obedience to the
spiritual Authority thereof, do notwithstanding now reduce that power and
Authority to which they profess subjection, unto a subordination of them and
their Authority to be directed by them, which will be of no longer permanency,
then that Church can ensnare the world again to an apprehension and belief of
the reality of their power, to beget which they continually endeavor and
aspire, and have no small hopes from the differences and divisions amongst
Protestants, for the increasing and fomenting whereof it is not to be imagined
that they are idle; but whatsoever their hopes and practices are, their
greatest strength remains in this, that it is generally believed that the
Church has a spiritual Authority for the cutting off of all schismatic
Members, and that this Authority is to be preserved in some one form or other
without any derivation thereof from any humane power, for then it clearly and
undoubtedly follows, that whosoever by such principles of reason taken from
the end of government does incline to Monarchy, and that this spiritual
Authority can best be preserved by the Supremacy of one man, then the Bishops
of Rome, having had for a long time, and for a long succession, and still
having the possession, besides other advantages of greatness and power which
begets strength and reputation, must and will be acknowledged by all those
to be the only spiritual Monarch in the Church armed with spiritual
Authority; and whosoever out of prejudice against the Church of Rome, taken
against her by reason of either her errors or abuses, or both, does separate
themselves from the Communion of that Church, and by consequence only free
themselves from her subjection, but do notwithstand adheare to and retain the
grounds of those errors and abuses, by acknowledging and believing that the
same spiritual Authority (which was presupposed to have been abused by the
Popes and Bishops of Rome as Usurpers only over the rest of the Clergy, or too
great a power and consequently dangerous in the hands of any one man) is not
only lawful but necessary as being Inherent in the function, and essential
for the preservation of union and unity, to be preserved in some other form
which they agree upon and like better then the incontrollable Supremacy of one
man, then this does necessarily follow, that albeit they free themselves from
all the errors and abuses which were introduced by the Supreamicie of one man,
yet so long as they acknowledge that the same power and Authority is resident
in others, they can never free themselves of all errors and abuses which are
introducible by Authority, but that the property and condition of things in
themselves indifferent will be changed from being indifferent and converted
into the nature and necessity of absolute duties, which ever begets bondage and
subjection, and sense of bondage does ever beget desire of liberty, which can
never be obtained so long as the opinion of a necessity of Authority in some
form or other is retained; and experience has now taught us, what could not
be foreseen by reason alone, without some additionall help from divine
illumination, that in the Church of England which did not only shake off the
Supreamicie of the Pope, but had purged her self of all those errors which
had either crept in, or were introduced by the power of that Supreamicie, by
retaining of Bishops, and giving them a part only of that spiritual
Authority, which formerly was acknowledged to Popes, and though quallifying
that part by restraining it from all legislative power, or a power to inact any
thing, but allowing it a Power of Judicature, the effectual operation and
proper working of that part of spiritual Authority, has now fully manifested
it self to tend to propogate superstition and error* rather then the
sincerity and truth of Religion; and as the natural motions of different
bodies, differing in quality and substance tend to different centers, the
natural motion of Episcopacy, has now discovered it self to endeavor
continually to unite it self to such a head to which it is capable to aspire,
rather then to be in subjection under such a head to which it has no capacity
to aspyre, and that received principle of State, that Episcopacy, is a support
to Monarchy, is now likewise discovered to be fraudulent and deceitefull, for
it is true that it is a support to a spiritual Monarchy or Monarchy in the
Church, as being the basis and foundation thereof, but does undermine and
destroy Monarchy in the State, especially in that State which does trust unto
it as to a supporter, and the reason is clear, for all supporters which have
no solid foundation, do ruinate those buildings, which are erected upon them
being of greater weight and substance then the foundation can bear, and the
foundation of Episcopacy being laid in the engrossing of spiritual Authority
or Ecclesiastical censures; Spiritual Authority it self has no other
existence nor being, but what it has in the Imagination and belief, which is
too slippery a ground to support a solid substance, such as temporal Monarchy
is, but may be sufficient to support an aerie and imaginary bulk, such as
spiritual Monarchy is, which Episcopacy not only supports, but continually
tends toward as to its proper center, and my Lord of Cant. when he obtained
the Kings good will to confirm by his Letters Patents, the late Canons, did
put a direct cheat upon his Majesty, for thereby the Kings Supreamicy in
causes Ecclesiastical was cut off, and from thence forth his Supreamicy over
Ecclesiastical persons should have been rather titular then real, If the
consent of Parliament could as easily have been obtained as his Majesty's own:
But to conclud this part of my Lord of Cant. Speech he might safely protest
upon his conscience, that his Majesty was a sound Protestant, according to the
Religion by law established, yet did it not thereupon follow, that he himself
was guiltles from the sentence of the law, because his actions being all
warranted by his Majesty's consent, they could not be divided from the Kings;
which is the chief thing implied by this particular. His second particular is
concerning the great and populous City, to which he is very kind and prays
God to bless it, but all his prayers for those who he conceives had done him
injury have a sting in them, and this prayer ends reproaching those he prays
for, as if some had subordned witnesses against his life by gathering of hands,
which he affirms to be a way that might endanger many an innocent man, and
may plucks innocent blood upon their own heads, and perhaps upon this City
also, which before he prayed God to bless, and now again to forbid this
Judgment, but his prayers are mixed with threats and all tending to justify
himself to his Auditors, whereof he is never unmindefull upon all occasions,
and having here occasion to mention the Parliament, he bestows glorious and
honorable Titles and epithrates upon it, as if that were sufficient to testify
his respects thereof, but he does contradict his own testimony by his
Inferences and Applications, for by Inference he applies the gathering of
hands, (which he affirms to have been practiced against himself,) to the
stirring up of the people against Saint Stephen, and to Herod's lying in wait
for Saint Peter's death, by observing how the people took the death of Saint
James. By which Instance he must mean that great, honorable, and wise Court
of the Kingdom, the Parliament, (those be the titles he bestows upon them)
for it was they that gave sentence against him, as Herod did against Saint
James, and would have done against Saint Peter, which no Christian thinks was
either honorably or wisely done of him, and therefore what opininion he had of
that great, honorable, and wise Court for sentencing of him may be collected,
and that his esteem of them was not so honorable as his expressions; but
whatsoever his esteem of them was, they were his Judges so will he never be
theirs which he here apprehended, when he did put the City in mind of the
Justice of God, and how fearful a thing it was, to fall into the Hands of the
living God, because God remembers and forgets not the complaynts of the poor,
a lesson which he never remembered when he himself did sit upon the Tribunal,
but is of special comfort unto him upon the Scaffold, for his blood was
innocent blood, and not only innocent blood in his own esteem but he had a
special Commission from God to tell them so, as Jeremiah had, in the 26. Chap.
of Jeremiah, ver. 15. the words were not expressed by him but directions given
to the place, the words be these, But know ye for certain, that if ye put me
to death, you shall surely bring innocent blood upon your selves, and upon this
City, and upon the Inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the Lord has sent me to
you to speak all these words in your ears. The words are so plain they need
no comment.

His third particular is, this poor Church of England, as he calls it, but
from thence no observation is to be drawn, for it is an undeniable truth what
is there affirmed, only it would be inquired after, who has been the
principal and Isntrumental cause of this great change, but he has made no
application and so will I.

His last particular is himself, and that about his religion, in which he is
very brief, choosing to express himself by circumstances which admit of a
latitude that may deceive the hearer or reader, rather then positively and
clearly whereby he leaves the hearer or reader as little satisfied as if he had
said nothing at all, yet does he confess his laboring to keep up an
Uniformity in the external worship of God, but makes no mention at all of what
means he used to do so, for in the ways which he took and in the means
which he used consisted his cheifest guilt, but that he passes over, and so
comes at last to speak of his accusation, which was no less then an
accusation of High treason, and by no meaner persons then by the whole Commons
of England assembled in their representative body in Parliament, and there and
by them proved against him, yet has he the confidence to say it was a crime
his soul ever abhorred, howsoever he proceeds to the parts of his charge being
two, an Endeavor in him to subvert the Law of the Realm, and a like Endeavor
to subvert the true Protestant Religion established by those Laws, both which
he seems to deny, but so mistically as that his meaning is rather to be
collected, then that it can be clearly discerned. For he expresses himself
variously, and answers in another form of words then which were proposed by
him; for having propounded them, that the charge against him was an Endeavor
to subvert the Law of the Realm, and a like Endeavor to overthrow the true
Protestant Religion established by those laws, he answers having first
protested, In the presence of Almighty God, and all his holy and blessed
angels, that he did take it now upon his death, that he never endeavored the
subversion of the Laws of the Realm, nor never any change of the Protestant
Religion, into Popish superstition; the sense of which words does imply a great
change from what they were, when first propounded, for by his first proposition
of them he expresses himself, to have been accused of an endeavor to subvert
the Law of the Realm; by which word Law in the singular number as in the
abstract may be understood the legislative power, or power of law-making,
comprehending the frame of this government, and including King and Parliament,
which he was charged to overthrow, by an Endeavor to introduce an Arbitrary
government, depending upon the will of the King alone, and excluding the
Parliament; and in his answer he makes mention of the subversion of the laws
in the plural number, where they are confined to different subjects, as to so
many individual substances, by which may be meant the particular acts and laws
issued forth and derived from that power, and may comprehend them all, which no
man did ever think or lay to his charge that he endeavored the subversion of
all the whole laws, and of every particular, and therefore here does appear a
fallacy and deceit, which is agreeable to his former practices, so likewise in
the other branch about Religion he first propounds it, of an Endeavor to
overthrow the true Protestant Religion established by those laws, and
answers, of any change of the Prottestant Religion into Popish superstition
which is a manifest difference, whereof hereafter: having occasion to speak
first of his esteem of Parliaments, which he takes occasion to mention here as
having bin accused as an enemy to them, the which he denies expressing a
Reverend esteem of them in the general, as of the greatest Court over which
no other Court can have any Jurisdiction in the Kingdom; but professes his
dislike against some few one or two Parliaments in particular, for some
misgovernments in them as he did conceive, but what those misgovernments were
he does not express, only in stead thereof a general reason is given,
Coruptio optimi est pessima, but from thence he might condemn and destroy all
Parliaments and the best of governments, and of every thing as often as he
pleases, if nothing more be required but that his affirmations must be
admitted for proofs, for there is nothing wherein the frailty of man must be
employed but may admit of error, and corruption, but it does not follow, that
whatsoever may, does; nor does it any where appear that any of those
Parliaments, which he here condemns, were guilty at all of any such
corruption as he lays to their charge, but the contrary is manifest, and if
for no other thing yet for this his esteem of them, for undoubtedly by him they
should have been better esteemed, If really and truly they had been more
corrupted; for Parliaments may be then said to be corrupted, when all or most
part of the members do subject their Votes to the determination and judgment
of others, preferring the particular pleasure, interrest or ends, of some whom
they respect, before the general good of all whom they represent; neither is
it any impossible thing so to pack a Parliament as not only the things to be
proposed and debated, but the greater number of the Members Votes shall depend
upon the pleasure of others, being agreed and united amongst themselves for a
particular and sinister end; for it is no false report but a well known and
undeniable truth, that in the choice of the Members of the lower House of
Parliament which does depend upon a free Election by the Gentry, Communalty,
and freeholders in England, the major number within their several limits and
jurisdictions giving it to whom they please, yet the reputation of some in some
places especially, has been such as to prescribe to those who were to choose,
who should be chosen by them, whereby many have been returned by the favor and
recommendation of others rather then by any merit of their own, and it is
probable that a design of changing Religion and altering the government having
been for a long time pursued by a faction of men who had obtained power and
favor about the King that they were not negligent, in making use of this
advantage for their own ends, and it plainly appears that they were not,
because at diverse times they had recourse to Parliaments in time of prosecution
of the design, before it was finished, which to some might seem a likely
means in all apperance to have overthrown all such design for ever, but the
success of those Parliaments and the conclusion which they made, does clearly
demonstrate what the designers purpose and intention was in calling them: for
the end of calling of all Parliaments, is either a purpose and desire of
releiving the Kings wants, and to supply his necessities or to redress the
grievances of the subjects, or both: for such has been the prudence of our
ancestors, in settling the frame of this government, not only to deny to their
Kings all power of imposing any taxes upon the Subjects with out their own free
consents, by their representative body assembled in Parliament, but did as it
were bind the hands of their Kings, by their own consents signified by diverse
Acts of Parliament, from so doing for ever. For which their Kings were
recompensed, with a special and absolute Prerogative of calling and dissolving
of Parliaments, at their will and pleasure only. The people being thereby
assured, that if a desire to right the peoples grievances, and for providing of
beneficial Laws were not sufficient motives and inducements to the King for
calling of Parliaments; yet the confideration of, and respect to his own
necessities and wants would move him: and diverse Parliaments having been
called, during the prosecution of this design, which have been dissolved
again, by the same Prerogative that called them, without any application of
redress either to the grievances of the Subjects, or to the Kings wan^s, does
manifest that (whatsoever the pretense was) the chief end and purpose of
calling those Parliaments, was never neither for redress of the Subjects
grievauces, nor for relief of the Kings wants; but chiefly to make trial what
strength they could make in the Parliament to finish their design by Authority
of Parliament. For having advanced their design so far at Court by their
prevalencie with His Majesty, that they had obtained the possession of the
greatest places, and places of greatest trust, both about His Majesty and in
the Kingdom: they were thereby of that credit and reputation, that none were
preferred to places of trust, nor to dignities, nor honors, without their
approbation, if not recommendation. Which did so secure them, that they needed
not fear the disappointment of their design by any opposition at Court, and so
far as the Kings power and Prerogative could further it. But the Kings
Prerogative being not absolute, the Laws of this Kingdom, and the Constitution
of this Government, having neither conferred an absolute power nor Prerogative
upon the Kings thereof, they could never finish their design (whatsoever it
was) by the Kings Prerogative alone, without an additionall confirmation by the
Subjects consents assembled in Parliament whereof they were likewise assured;
if by the reputation and strength of their Faction they could procure such a
certain number to be returned Members of the lower House, as they might be
confident of, would suffer their Votes to be directed by them, by which means
they might hope to carry any thing in that House which should be proposed by
His Majesty, or in His Majesty's name, of whose deliberations and
determinations they were the chief disposers.

As for the House of Peers, there was no doubt at that time of a prevalent
party to concur with them, by reason of the Bishops Votes, and Court Lords,
and others who were obliged to them by many favors; they being the chief
disposers of all favors, which did either depend upon or proceed from His
Majesty's gift. For all which causes and considerations there was no danger to
call a Parliament, whenever they pleased: For if the Parliament did not
answer their expectation, it was in the same men's power to persuade the King to
dissolve it, who had the credit to persuade His Ma. to call it. His Majesty
suspecting no ends in them but what was pretended for His Majesty's service.
But the succes of those Parliaments declared, that the credit of the Faction
was not so great in the country as at Court; for which my L. of Cant. does
here tax them with misgovernment, professing his dislike, against them only,
which must be conceived was, because they were not yet molded nor brought to
that frame to condescend to every thing that he and others should project, as
was the late Synod. And the great number of Patentees, and Monopolists chosen
this Parliament, and others who have deserted the Parliament, and have sitten
since in an Anti-parliament at Oxford, does sufficiently demonstrate upon whom
they depended, and for whose Interests their Votes have been devoted from the
beginning, whether for the general benefit of King and Kingdom, or only to
serve the particular ends of such who either in all probability did recommend
them, or otherwise from whom they did expect preferment or some other reward.

But from hence may be collected, that the design for altering Religion, and
the frame of the Government being two different things, that they were not
alike intended by the Designers, but that the design for altering of Religion
was principally intended by them; and that the other design of introducing an
Arbitrary government to the King was but the bait to deceive the King, thereby
to insinuate the better with him, and to engage His Majesty to them, and was
chiefly made use of, as subservient and conducing to the other design of
Religion that was the only design with them: which is made manifest by the
progress of both designs. For as all motions which by their slownesse or
distance seem insensible to the beholder, so as at first view it cannot be
discerned whither they tend, yet are easily perceived by their progress: so
the dark and disguised ends of this design, which could not endure the light
of open profession, is clearly discernable by the progress which it has made.
For albeit that an Arbitrary power in the King has been made use of in many
things, to the great prejudice of the Subject, tending to the manifest
destruction of the Subjects Liberties, and Privileges of Parliament; yet when
a true account shall be taken, what great benefit has returned to the Regal
Authority by all that has been done, the total sum will be found at the end
of the Church-mens bill, but none at all at the Kings; where on the contrary,
manifest detriment and loss will appear, and that the Kings Prerogative has
been stretched upon the tenters beyond its true by as, to set up and settle an
absolute or Independent Prerogative in the Church to Churchmen, which is
inconsistent with the Prerogative of the Crown: for whenever the Prerogative
of Churchmen is advanced to such a height, as that it grows either absolute
or Independent, the Prerogative of the Crown is either subjected or undermined,
and the King parts with a real Authority, depending upon his own reason and
judgment chiefly, to be directed by the will and judgment of another, unless
the smart of his Sword does terrify more nor the apprehension of theirs, which
is all the remedy that will be left him whenever the chief Governor or
Governors of the Church and he do differ. And the remedy which the late Cannons
applied for the securing of all men, against any suspicion of revolt to Popery,
has manifested to all men how far the progress to Popery was advanced, when
it durst appear nothing at all disguised, but under a thin vail of some few
deceitful words, in a Pontifical robe of absolute Authority constituting and
ordaining; and to show how absolute and Independent the Protestant Church of
England was grown, the words; We straightly command all Parsons, Vicars, and
Curates, and we enjoin all Archbishops and Bishops, and We decree and ordain;
are used all along in the several Articles published, which are all words of
absolute Authority and command, and the penalties enforcing obedience to all
those absolute commands, are either suspension and deprivation to the Clergy,
or the dreadful censures of Excommunication, and casting into hell to all
others. For no less punishment does the sentence of Excommunication imply,
because the party excommunicate being cast out of all communion with the
Church, is thereby presupposed to be deprived of all the benefits that he may
hope for by virtue of Christ's death and mediation, so long as he remains in the
state of excommunication, which is a great terror to all them that do not
rightly understand the nature of Excommunication, and what the authority of
Churchmen is, which is ever the much greater part of those who are members of
any Church, besides the great number of others which be in all Churches that
slight the censure of Excommunication, as being a censure from which they feel
no present smart, without which it has no operation with them, for the
enforcing of whom especially, it was by these Cannons enjoined, that every
Bishop shall once every year send into His Majesty's high Court of Chancery a
Significavit of all such who have stood excommunicated beyond the time limited
by the Law, and shall desire that the Writ De Excommunicato capiendo might be
at once sent out against them all, Ex Officio. And for the better execution of
their Decrees, They did most humbly beseech his most sacred Majesty, that the
Officers of the high Court of Chancery, whom it shall concern, may be commanded
to send out the aforesaid Writ from time to time, as is desired, and that the
like command also may be laid upon the Sheriffs and their Deputies, for the
due and faithful execution of the said Writs, as often as they shall be
brought unto them. Which whenever they should obtain, would put the Supremacy
of all Authority into the hands of some of the Clergy, by necessitating the
smarting stroke of the Magistrates Sword to follow of course upon notification
of theirs, whereby all Magistracy and Law should be but executioners of their
sentence, from which there was no appeal, but by submission deserving
absolution, which was ordained by the authority of the foresaid Synod, not to
be given, until the party to be absolved should come as a penitent, humbling
himself upon his knees, and first take an Oath, De parendo Juri, and stando
mandatis Ecclesiae. And for a perpetual subjecting of all men into a vassalage
and subjection to the Authority of Bishops and others of the Clergy, it was
there decreed, That all Clergy men, and all others who should take any degree
of learning in any of the Universities, and all that should be licensed to
practice Physic, all Registers, Actuaryes and Proctors, all Schoolmasters, and
all others that should come to be incorporated in any of the Universities here,
having taken a degree in any foreign University, should take an Oath in a
prescribed and set form of words, before they should be admitted to take their
degrees, Never to give their consent to alter the government of this Church by
Archbishops, Bishops, Deans, and Archdeacons, By which means, an equal
allegiance should have been paid to them as to the King and his Successors for
ever: And all this was presented to the blinded world, and abused King, as a
remedy to secure men against any suspicion of revolt to Popery, which was
nothing else but a public setting up of Popery, though not yet of the Popes
supremacy, which was to follow; and employing the help and assistance of the
Magistrates Sword, and the force and power of the Laws of the Land to that very
use and end; For Popery consists neither in this or that superstition nor
Idolatry, nor in this or that erroneous Doctrine, nor in all-together,
principally and chiefly; but in the absoluteness of spiritual authority
commanding Implicit obedience, to whatsoever Doctrine or Superstition shall be
invented by man, as necessary and essential to the true worship of God, under
the threatened pain and penalty of Excommunication and Interdiction, and
promising the kingdom of heaven to whomsoever it pleases, as a gift or reward
within the power of man: and the assumption of which so divine and incompetent
a power to any man or mankind united together, and the deriving thereof from
one solely to others, as inherent in the person or function of one only, does
necessarily infer and presuppose the gift of Infallibility in him who does so
assume it, that he may become an unappealable Judge, which does exalt him, in
the sight and esteem of those men who do believe in him, and willingly submit
unto him, to the nature and dignity of the incommunicable prerogative of God,
and makes him undeniably the revealed Antichrist to others, by usurping and
possessing the throne of Christ upon earth, for whom only, such dominion and
authority is reserved in heaven.

And the root of Popery or Antichristianity (for so it may be termed, as
tending continually thither by the Doctrine which it teaches, and the
Authority which it usurpeth) lies in this very principle, that a power of
excommunicating and absolving, or sending into heaven or hell, is assumed by
some as depending upon the purpose and will of man, according to the nature of
Authority, and consented to and believed by others; and the danger to temporal
Authority lies in the universality and generality of the belief and assent,
and the difference between the incontrolable supremacy of the Pope, and the
exalted Prelacy of Bishops pretending to the same Authority is but a difference
of degrees, but not of kinds. For, for the settling of this Authority into the
supremacy of any one, there is a necessity of engrossing it into the hands of
some few first; and Popes had never mounted to their omnipotent throne of
Supremacy, if a superiority of some of the Clergy invested with spiritual
authority over others had not been first assented unto. For the same rule,
necessity, and end requires the supremacy of one Bishop over all other
Bishops, that requires the superiority of any Clergy man into the dignity of a
Bishop over many others of the Clergy: and the same danger of spiritual error
indangering the soul lies upon all that are subject to this spiritual
authority, whether it be derived from the supremacy of one, or a superiority
only of others, or from the Democracy of all the Clergy assembled together, or
from the Independencie of everyone within their several Congregations, so long
as it is entertained and received in the belief as a sufficient ground or
warrant for obedience to what shall be ordained by it: and the exercising of
spiritual authority under a different form of external government only,
being a difference rather in form then substance, all of them may divide unity
in the ends and consequences of government, by dividing of Authority which is
the preserver of unity; but each of them does admit of degrees of more and
less, according as the form embraced is more or less absolute. The
superiority therefore of Bishops over the rest of the Clergy, which may be as
Independent as any other form, but can never be so absolute as the supremacy of
the Pope, in regard it can never beget nor enforce so general a dependencie
and subjection of all men unto it, wherein union and strength consists, is
never so dangerous to that State which entertains it, as when it declares its
Independencie, and aspires to be absolute. And albeit that Episcopacy does
continually endeavor and aspire to be united by the Supremacy of one of their
own order, because thereby they arise to a further degree of strength and
perfection, to which all sublunary creatures have a natural propension,
inclination, and desire; yet can they not at all times, nor whenever they
please, attain to their desires. And the Archbishop of Canterbury having
discovered and manifested unto the world how independent the authority of
Churchmen here in England was grown, and how absolute they coveted to be, did
give a clear evidence at the same time how far the progress to the Popes
Supremacy was advanced; which is made more manifest by the concurrence and
joint endeavors of Papists of all sorts, not only agreeing with, but
laboring in the same design with some of our Clergymen and others. For their
indefatigable labors and renewed pains, with so much blood and danger to the
undertakers ever since the Reformation, have all tended to that end chiefly, as
to the only mark at which they have ever aimed. The threatening Bals, and many
dangerous conspiracies and invasions in Queen Elizabeth's time, and the most
damnable Gunpowder Treason in King James his time, are clear proofs how
implacable their malice has been against all Reformation, that did depose the
Pope from his pretended right of Supremacy, and how violently they have been
transported to reinthrone him again, which is but the ultimate end of all such
dangerous and desperate undertakings, but the immediate is always and ever
has been for some particular ends to the undertakers, springing from their own
ambition, and covetous desire of dominion and rule, from which Papists are
excluded by the Laws of this Land establishing the Reformation: for the desire
of authority, and to have a command over others is a natural desire to all
ambitious men; and ambition is an inherent quality in all men, flowing from the
operation and effectual working of the spiritual substance of the soul, which
coveteth to mount and aspire continually, but is predominant only in some. And
no man (that may choose) does hazard his own life, for restitution of another
to his right being lost, but he that hopes to participate and share with him or
under him after the recovery, in some proportion and measure, though not in an
equal degree. And since the Gunpowder Treason, they having not only forborne
all forcible attempts, against either the life and safety of the King, or the
public peace and tranquillity of the Kingdom, until the present Rebellion in
Ireland did break out, upon which the war against the Parliament ensued; but
seeming extraordinarily and strangely converted in their dispositions and
desires, and of deadly and implacable enemies, appearing the most dutiful
Subjects of all others, pretending to be the most zealous instruments for the
enlargement and promotion of that power and authority which was bound by
special interest to suppress them, is an argument of some well studied and
close followed design, rather then any symptom of change of disposition; for
they can never change their dispositions, so long as they retain their wicked
principles and false doctrines, which principally gives life and motion to the
wickedness of their dispositions, and the desire of dominion and rule is
impetuous and incessant, to which they can never have a legal right in this
Kingdom until all those Laws be repealed which disable them; the doing whereof
and not the Kings Prerogative is a principal motive with them in all their
undertakings and designs, and the great potencie and prevalencie of Papists
about His Majesty in all his consultations and actions, do manifest and
declare what their purposes and intentions are; that this Independent authority
of Bishops coveting to be so absolute (which has been set up of late in the
Church of England, and confirmed by the King, and by his Prerogative Royal)
shall acknowledge the Pope for their Head and not the King: for Popes were
never so munificent rewarders of any man's deserts or duties, as to part with
that which they accounted their right, to give it away to another; and Papists
were never so undutifull sons as to labor for the setting up of an Arbitrary
power and unlimited Prerogative to an heretical King: when his Holiness has
given sentence that no Heretic is capable of any Authority at all, and that
all men are to be accounted for Heretics who deny the Popes Supremacy;
wherefore in the conclusion, His Majesty must either part with that Supremacy
which the Law has given him, and submit to the Popes, or be deprived of all
Authority whatsoever, which is all he must expect from them, or by their aid
and assistance. And the great favors which has been always showed to Papists
since the beginning of His Majesty's Reign, but more especially now, the
partial indulgence toward the bloodiest and cruellest of all Rebellions, and
to the most perfideous of all Nations, the Irish, accounting them for good
Subjects after so many barbarous massacres and horrid executions of an infinite
number of English and Scottish Protestants, rather then the King shall agree
with his Parliament in England, for the saving of the lives of his Protestant
Subjects here, and choosing to continue the war in England at the expense of
his English Subjects lives; by whom his Majesty has ever, and must still, if
ever, subsist in power, dignity, and honor; and to the great peril and
manifest hazard of His Majesty's own life, rather then break off that
Cessation, which His Majesty had not power to make with the Irish, from whom
His Majesty never received better fruits then at a great expense of treasure,
and of his other Subjects lives, to reduce and keep them to a forced duty and
allegiance; and the overruling of His Majesty's reason and judgment to
approve and consent to the Popes Supremacy in Ireland, which is known and
acknowledged to be destructive to His Majesty's Supremacy and just Prerogative,
rather then an extirpation of Episcopacy which is the foundation and assent to
the Popes Supremacy shall be consented to in England, upon a bare presupposall
that it is a necessary support to Monarchy; when it has never been yet
examined what Monarchy it supports, whether spiritual or temporal: and
whether that which is a necessary supporter to the one, is compatible with the
other, having shaken off the yoke of spiritual Monarchy, and renounced not
only all subjection to it, but all communion with it; and trusting of Papists
upon their bare words and deceitful professions, against their known unsound
tenets and doctrines, rather then the Parliament and Protestant Subjects shall
be believed upon their solemn Vow and Covenant for the preservation and
defense of His Majesty's person and Authority. And lastly, employing of known
and professed Reeusants, trusting them with Arms and Authority, without any
caution or consideration how they may be disarmed again, rather then that the
Parliament shall be suffered to dispose of the Militia of the Kingdom for the
safety and security thereof for some limited time, are all clear and manifest
proofs what their power and prevalence with the King is; And do all conclude,
that an Arbitrary power and unlimited Prerogative pretending for the King,
having been made use of and exercised by them, yet was never intended for the
King, nor for the improving nor advancing of the Kings Prerogative; but only
to make use of it for erecting and setting up of an Independent Authority in
the Church to Ecclesiastical persons: and by means thereof to introduce the
Popes Supremacy as the chief and ultimate end of their design. And that His
Majesty has been grossly abused, and craftily overreached by disguised
Impostors, and deceitful parasites, pretending one thing when intending the
contrary. Whereof amongst other things my Lord of Canterbury his equivocall
expressions at the hour of his death gives some light; at what time being
desirous to justify himself publicly to the world, of his endeavors for
changing the Religion, he expresses himself of endeavoring only to change
the Protestant Religion to Popish superstition, as if there had been no other
danger from Popery but of introducing of gross and absurd Superstition, to
many of which embraced by them, and set up by Papal Authority, it may be
granted him and believed that he was no real friend, but might condemn them
in his own opinion and judgment; when notwithstanding it was certain and
clear, that he not only befriended, but courted and ambitiously coveted that
honor and authority which did establish that superstition; and which must of
necessity still produce some superstition or other in the worship of God: and
has now sufficiently discovered it self to endeavor continually to introduce
Superstition and Ignorance as the principal means to induce men, by a blind
devotion to submit to an implicit obedience of what shall be required of them,
and imposed upon them. But that was passed over by him as a thing wherein he
was not concerned; yet his practices tending thither was the chief thing
concerning Religion whereof he was accused, and for which he was condemned: and
possibly he might be deceived himself by the fallacy of deceitful grounds and
false principles, the consequences whereof might not appear so clearly to
himself as to others, which might be the cause, why he did endeavor to
justify himself of his intentions only; when the charge against him, was for
his practices and actions chiefly which he acknowledged to have been proved
against him, by acquitting his Judges as having proceeded secundum allegata and
probata. For he might flatter himself with an opinion of good intentions,
thinking all was necessary and good which he went about: but thinking so, he
did but deceive himself as well as others, which is the best charity that can
be allowed him by the most charitable Christians that are not misled by the
same principles and grounds that did deceive him; and the most favorable
construction that can be made of him is, that albeit he was a great Doctor and
Statesman also, yet was he to learn the true principles of the Christian
Religion, when he went out of the world, and that his principles of government
were no better, then his principles of Religion.

By the result of all which two things are demonstrated and declared. The first
is, that they who do believe and are of opinion, that they are the only
assertors and defenders of the Kings Prerogative, and of the Regal power, by
fighting against the Parliament, for the maintaining and defending of all that
is established and approved by the King in this difference between King and
Parliament, do but contribute their help and assistance for the undermining and
destroying of the Regal power, and of the Kings just Prerogative The second
is, that the King is not resisted because his will is opposed by his
Parliament, which is the Kings great Council, and the representative body of
his Kingdom; and the reason of both is, because by the constitution and frame
of this Government Kings of this Kingdom may never give away their rights, and
that power and authority which they themselves have over the Subjects, nor
transfer the same upon any other, without the general consent of the
Subjects; which can never be obtained but by their representative Body
assembled in Parliament. And the obtaining of His Majesty's will in this, would
be of more dangerous consequence to himself, and to the Regal Authority, then
ever yet appeared to himself, or can ever appear, so long as he is separated
and divided from his great Council, where, by a free debate of all
consequences, and by a clear discovery of all sinister ends and fraudulent
practices, the truth of all can only appear; and without whom His Majesty can
determine nothing by himself, nor by his own judgment therein. The question
being of exposing himself, his Successors, all his Subjects, and their
posterity to a bondage, and subjection under a heavy yoke and foreign Head;
usurping a spiritual Authority, and claiming homage and universal obedience
thereunto by Divine right, as being, Christ's Vicar general, and the supreme
Head of the Church upon earth: And the consequences of which being, that the
acknowledgement of this claim, and a general belief thereof only, does
necessarily subject all other power and Authority unto it; by reason that the
faculties of the soul upon which this spiritual authority has the chiefest
influence and operation, do easily subject and subdue all the powers of the
body. And it is now experimentally known, that men being once subdued to the
apprehension and belief of this spiritual Authority, by their intellectuals
and rational parts chiefly, they are kept in obedience as to their duty by
their sensitive parts, and by all manner of forcible means, which makes it a
real power and authority that before was only imaginary; and by means thereof
becomes a power superior, to all humane power, and cannot be contradicted nor
controlled by no power nor authority, that is in man, and can neither be
limited nor confined within any certain bounds, nor be directed by no rule nor
Law whatsoever.

But notwithstanding would suddenly vanish, if the grounds and ends of all
spiritual authority, to be exercised under any form of Ecclesiastical
government, were fully examined, and discovered to be nothing but the
imagination of man, which would infallibly follow if nothing were taken for
granted without evidence and proof, which is the end of all Councels and
Consultations, and the principal duty of every rational man: and reason is in
nature before all the other faculties of the soul, and is the foundation of all
other gifts and graces whatsoever, but not the perfection, and therefore is it
given to all men as a difference and distinction between man and beast: when
other gifts and abilities are given only to some; And the end of Government is
discovered to man by the light of reason, and conduces to the very being of
man, which must be provided for, before any thought or consideration can be had
of well being, or of any other perfection. And therefore unity, which is the
preserver of humane society, must be provided for before any other duty that is
required of man. For the preservation of humane society tends to the
propagation of mankind, in which the being of man consists, as from which it
is derived, without recourse to a new creation; and all Authority, which is the
preserver of Unity, must be derived from one head or fountain which in this
Kingdom is from the Regal Power. For no man denies that the King is the Head
of his people; and all men know and acknowledge that He is never in his
Supremacy nor absolute but by his Parliament. Which as it is the representative
Body of the people; so is it the Supreme Council of the King. And therefore
without it He is neither the head of a complete body (but of a Faction) nor a
complete head; For the Parliament being the representative of the people
becomes thereby their living soul, including the will and desires of all the
people, as comprehending them all: But being the Kings great Council, who is
the head of the people, it does supply the office and nature of all the
external senses which are placed in the head for the use of the body, and
especially to inform and assist the intellectual faculties inhabiting the
head, for the giving of due influence upon the body, without which a body
politic does languish and consume; being fed and nourished by the vigorous
operation of the intellectuals descending from the head, as a body natural does
by sustenance and meat. Wherefore what God has conjoined, let no man separate:
and whosoever wishes well to the prosperity of this Kingdom, let him endeavor
the conjunction of King and Parliament: And whosoever nourishes division
between them, let them be esteemed as the betrayers of their Country, and
enemies to mankind; and let God arise and his enemies will be scattered. But as
my Lord of Canterbury had a legal trial, and just sentence, so may all such
disguised Traitors to the Kingdom, and fraudulent deceivers of the King, in
going about to steal from him his real right and Authority, by a counterfeit
show of making it better, perish and be confounded in their own craft as
public Enemies to King and Parliament, where only the Supremacy of all
Authority in England does rest, with the King, and in the King; but not in the
Kings will, but in his reason: which as it renders him most absolute, so does
it appear most eminent, by concurring with the desires of all his people, when
exhibited to him by them who represents them all; and are likewise his supreme
Council, to which all other Councels and Courts whatsoever are subordinate and
accountable: by doing whereof only he is united with his people, and his
people with him, wherein the strength of both consists, and then may he
confidently say, If God be with us, who can be against us.

FINIS.
