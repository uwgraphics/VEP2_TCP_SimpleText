To the High Court of Parliament of the Commonwealth of England, etc.
The humble Petition of John Wagstaff, Gent. Inhabitant of the County of
Warwick.
Shows:
THat whereas Sir Richard Temple Barronet, was chosen a Member of this present
Parliament, for the County of Warwick, being under the Age of one and twenty
years, until the 28 of April next, as appears by the Registers Book of Saint
Martins in the Fields, it being contrary to the Instrument of Government; And
whereas many of the said County of Warwick did by Petition to the Lord
Protector and his Council make known so much, whereupon the said Sir R. Temple
was rejected by the said Council, as a person incapable to sit in Parliament,
and the Petitioners were promised that a new Writ should issue forth for the
choosing another in his place, which being delayed, the said Sir Richard Temple
has contrary to the said qualification, intruded himself into the House, which
your Petitioner fears may be prejudicial to him in regard of a trial with Sir
Richard Temple by Doctor Denton his Guardian, although his Interest is wholly in
trust, for the Lord Baltinglass is in right of his Lady, the Trial being for
sum 1000 l. per annum, on Monday next in the Upper Bench.

Therefore he humbly prays that the said Sir R: T: (according to the said
qualification, which all other Countries have carefully followed, as the County
of Warwick are desirous to observe;) may not be admitted to sit in the House,
but that a new Writ may be issued for the chosing of another in his place.

And your Petitioner shall ever pray, etc. John Wagstaff.
