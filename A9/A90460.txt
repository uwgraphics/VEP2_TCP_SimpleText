A PERFECT CVRE FOR Atheists, Papists, Arminians, and all other Rebels and
Traitors, both against CHURCH and STATE.
TAke half a months voyage to the Mistaking of Cales; three grains of Salt
brought from the Isle of Ree, where so many brave Gentlemen were murdered,
five Promises for the relief of Rochel, ten flames of the Spanish Ships that
were sent to conquer England, one hundred barrels of powder that was sent from
the Tower for their assistance, one ounce of Sir Thomas Overburies Potion, one
dram of King James his Cordial made by Buckingham, of his Majesty's
Protestations, and Proclamations, of the Cabinate Councels Honesty, of Harry
Jermans Honor Of Prince Ruperts Religion, of Digbyes honest Heart, of Prince
Henry's perfumed Gloves, of each two grains; of the Ashes of all those Towns
the Cavaliers have burned in England, of each an hundred bushells, 400000.
Flourishes of the Cavaliers swords made red with Protestants blood, seven of
the good Purposes they had to demand the five Members, one of her Majesty's
good Intentions to this Kingdom, with one hundred thousand pounds worth of the
Crown Jewels she pawned in Holland, the five famous Battles, of Edghill, York,
Newbury, Cherinton-Down, and Naisby; the Siege of Gloucester, Exceter and Lyme,
the hopeful Promises of Peace, when they fell upon the Redcoats at Branchford,
one hundred thousand cursings of the Parliament pronounced by a damned sort of
Rebels and Traitors, with as many blasphemies from the same cursed crew; the
massacre of Bolton, the plunder of Leicester, thirty five Pattentees, two or
three years payment of Shipmoney, thirty Commissioners of Array for Oppression
and Tyranny, two head fuls of mischief of Bristol and Cottington, thirty three
heartfulls of the Oxford Iunto fears, and three pound of their slavery, half an
ounce of University Oaths, one scruple of Choplogick, three Arguments at Law of
Heaths own making, five gallons of Holy water of the Vicechancellors own
consecrating, one Case of Conscience of Doctor Fern in the behalf of Tyranny,
one of Finches just Judgments, especially that against Thomas Bensted that was
drawn, hanged, and quartered for beating of a drum, two ounces of the Irish
Commission, one ounce and half of the wax that sealed it, three penfulls of the
Ink that wrote it, two Kilderkins of Irish Protestants blood, fifty two
Atheist Commissions to plunder Roundheads, three of the Kings performances at a
Sessions at Oxford, when much was said, but nothing mended, five Subsidies
granted, and the Parliament ended, three quarters of a yard of the Kings
morning cloak he wore when he broke the last Parliament, and three hundred
projects to break this, of Sir Jacob Ashleys fidelity to fight for the
Protestant Religion, of Capels Lordship, and Lunsfords left heel, of each three
pound, three of Sir Marmaduk Langdals intents to relieve Colchester, with three
thousand Scots Rebels to assist him, three of old Harries Letters to the Pope
to assure his Holiness he will live and die in that Faith, three Common Service
Books sent to Scotland to begin Popery there first, three pound of Doctor
Cozens Candles he set up on Candlemas day for to say Mass by, three devout
Congeis to the high Altar by three degrees of comparison, three flames of the
wax Candles that stood upon the Altar in the Kings Chapel at White Hall,
three bricks of the little Popish Chapel built at his Chamber door at
White Hall, where he might lie in bed and hear Mass; three good Notes of the
Cavaliers own writing of a Sermon on a Fast day, and three half penny worth of
their Charity to the relief of the Irish Protestants, three Crowns worth of
Straffords Kingly honors, three thousand scandalous lies made by Cavaliers
against the Parliament and Army, which were as true as their damned swearing,
and laying of wagers to confirm it, that my Lord Fairfax was killed by a
Butcher, and who saw it, and that L. G. Cromwell was killed by his own
Soldiers, and buried in Gloucester, both which I hope shall live to see a
thousand such Rebels and Traitors hanged, if not worse, three half penny worth
of Hollands Chastity, and three half penny worth of Gorings good Conditions, all
the Honesty and Religion both their partakers ever had, three of my Lord
Francis last God-dam-ye when he ran himself headlong into Hell, rather then
take quarter of a Roundhead, in the Rebellion at Kingston, three half penny
worth of the truth and honesty of the two Constables of Putney and Wandsworth,
and the rest of the Inhabitants that aided and assisted the thieves in robbing
Sir Robert Wood and his Kinsman, three farthing worth of the Cavaliers
bounteous Charity given to Christian Protestants, slanderously called
Roundheads and Independants, three dances about a Maypole on a Sunday in the
afternoon, three hundred Tolerations for profaning the Lords Day, three
bushels of ashes of Beaver-hats sacrificed in healths to the King, Queen, and
Black Boy in the Buffe. Put all these in Lucasses Brain-pan that was shot to
death for Treason and Rebellion, with fifteen drops of his Majesty's tears that
he shed for grief when he heard it, and covered with Straffords night cap, and
set it on the Embers of the Suburbs of Colchester, that was burned for the
liberty of the Subject, and make it boil the space of a Masque or Mass at
White Hall; then strain it with one of Canterburies lawne Sleeves when he stood
to see Burton, Pryn, and Bastwicks ears cut off in, and sweeten it with three
thousand three hundred thirty three handfuls of the Surrenian Petitioners bays
they did wear in their hats when they went for Peace, or pull the Parliament
out by the Ears. Give three quarters of an ounce cursing and swearing, made
murtherous hot with the breath of a Jesuit blown through an Organpipe, and
wrap the neck hard with a yard and a half of Tompkins halter, and stop the
breath one hour. If this fail to cure any of them, the Devil mend them all.

FINIS.
