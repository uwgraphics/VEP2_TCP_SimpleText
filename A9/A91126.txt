THE PROTESTATION OF THE ARCHBISHOPS AND BISHOPS OF IRELAND Against the
Toleration of Popery agreed upon, and subscribed by them at DUBLIN, the 26 of
NOVEMBER.

London, Printed, 1641.

The Protestation of the Archbishops and Bishops of IRELAND, against the
toleration of POPERY, agreed upon, and subscribed by them at DUBLIN the 26 of
November. in the year of our Lord 1626.
THe Religion of the Papists is Superstitious and Idolatrous, their faith and
Doctrine erroneous and Heretical; Their Church, in respect of both,
Apostaticall. To give them therefore a Toleration, or to consent that they may
freely exercise their Religion, and confess their Faith and Doctrine, is a
grievous sin: and that in two respects.

First, It is to make our selves accessarie, not only to their Superstitions,
Idolatries, Heresies, and in a word, to all the abominations of Popery; but
also (which is a consequence of the former) to the Perdition of the seduced
people, which perish in the deluge of their Catholic Apostasy.

Secondly, To grant them a Tolleration in respect of any money to be given, or
contribution to be made by them, is to set Religon to sale, and withal, the
souls of the people, whom Christ our Savior has redeemed with his most
precious blood.

And as it is a great Sin, so it is a matter of most dangerous consequence,
the consideration whereof we leave to the wise and judicious: beseeching the
jealous God of truth to make all those who are in Authority zealous of Gods
glory, and the advancement of true Religion, and resolute and courageous
against all Popery, Superstition and Idolatry.

FINIS.
