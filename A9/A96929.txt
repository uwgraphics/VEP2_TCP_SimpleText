A WORD To the Twenty ESSAYS toward a Settlement, etc.
Who under a pretense of a Testimony for God either ignorantly (as charity
persuades) or voluntarily, give forth a perilous one, especially as to the
concernable matter of it.
GENTLEMEN,
HAVING Perused your Essay, I find it as short of it is intent as the Nation is
of a settlement, but I could wish that it came from such a spirit (as it is
swift comprehensions would seem to import) that could at once unite divided
interests, and secure them from the undermining attempts of their hypocritical
professing leaders. I shall as briefly as I can lay open the weightiest part of
your Testimony (waving many honest things therein, though doubtless bottomed
with a great deal of craft) which from your Paper I gather to be this,
suspending the rights of the Nation, you declare for such men to be Rulers that
are qualified and limited according to the word of God, men of courage, fearing
God and hating covetousness.

To this I Object; First, The injustice of your Testimony it being impossible
that any number of men should be imposed and perpetuated Governors of this
Nation without absolute violence offered to the rights thereof, as may be
evinced from the practice of the Commonwealth of Israel, there being also no
reason in nature much less divine, for supremacy or a general subjection,
without the consent of the people first had, to the Legislators, conditions and
laws thereof.

Secondly, If upon Objection (that a great part of the people have by acting
against, forfeited their right hereto, or otherwise through ignorance of
profaneness are incapeable of it, and so we contract the Nation into such
part unanimously owned the quarrel against Royalty (whose divisions are
lamentable and the Land groans under) by what equity can you vindicate your
testimony to exclude the interest of those that hazzarded their lives and goods
equally, if not more then your selves, to purchase this freedom with you, how
will the soul of any impartial man abhor your ingratitude and unchristian-like
dealing to ravish that from others and your brethren too, that you would not to
be taken from your selves, what glorious pretense soever this comes under, as
the reign of Christ and his kingdom, self, ambition, and a Mystery of iniquity
may be as well suspected to be the root, though it may be not intended by the
more simple ones.

Thirdly, The Constitution of Government you mention (I mean not the
qualifications of the persons) must ineritably induce confusion and ruin, the
temper of the Nation being totally unsuitable to it, the minds of most sober
men being big with expectations of a more equal distribution of Government, for
the reuniting of dissenting parties, so much promised and successfully
speculated into of late days, which if again disappointed by the insinuation
of an absolute arbitrary and constant power, will aggravate our annamosities,
inflame hatred, and expose the whole as a prey to the common enemy, besides the
confusion, that naturally must follow your model, is very evident, for where
will you find discerning spirits that shall pick out men so qualified, and
secure the Nation that under a Mask of Religion, they shall not play their own
game and exceed their Teachers, and Predecessors? And how can you promise your
selves that those who shall invest such men with power shall remain their
obedient humble servants and not when their ends shall be served, with your
assistance usher in a single Person again, seeing it may be probable that
those who contributed so freely to advance the former, in reason should as
eagerly pursue it for themselves.

Moreover, Gentlemen, If you reflect upon past providence toward Episcopacie,
and Presbittery, both pretending Divine right, and under it crowding into the
civil Government for which they are sufficiently condemned, you will find
your pretense to be much of that nature, rather worse, for under covert of
Christ's kingdom, you would carry all away, you may well fear your success,
for he does not appear to be a Patron of so much wrong, seeing there are as
many fervent lovers of his kingdom, that are not of your mind in this
settlement, as you can pretend to, and for this reason to loose their rights,
as men will not be owned by that King in the day of his appearing; Neither can
we see men so divinely fortified amongst you as to count them more invincible
then others to the baits of Honors and profits that may be exposed to them in
places of trust. I shall therefore wind up with this advice to you and all
others that desire the peace and prosperity of their Country, that they will
wait with patience the issues of providence, which as we may hope on good
ground, will not long indulge a selfish spirit amongst us, the experience
whereof may make men tremble that harbor it: and let us multiply our
supplications to Heaven, for a spirit of truth in the Parliament, the only
present visible power, to perform their promises to the Nation, to settle them
in a well constituted Commonwealth, so limited as may secure the interest of
the honest, and insinuate to the love of their enemies, and it might be wished,
such provisions might be made for elections to power, by lot that providence
might have a more immediate dispose thereof, for our good or evil, at his
pleasure.

By a friend to peace and unity, but an enemy to strife and sedition.
