A True and Impartial RELATION Of the whole matters concerning the proceedings
of several Councels of War, against W. Tompson, a free Commoner of England,
which may serve for a refutation to a scandalous paper, entitled, The
Vindication of Lieutenant General Cromwell, and Commissary General Ireton, and
the late proceedings against the said William Tompson at White Hall, where he
remains prisoner; now published by him for the better satisfaction of the
Kingdom.
Gentlemen,
FRee Commoners of England, I stand condemned to die, and may in probability in
short time appear in the presence of that just and impartial God, who knows
the secrets of all hearts, to give an account of the truth of all my actions,
and real intentions. And I desire his mercy no otherwise, then according to the
truth of this relation, and therefore I rip up my own infirmities, because I
aim at the truth, rather then justification. To undeceive those whom partial
and untrue discoveries may have beguiled into a belief: not nothing short of
death, can satisfy those unparalled wicked actions of late laid to my
charge. Therefore I shall begin with the discovery of my folly about August
last, 1647. I was at the Ostrich Inn (not in the night, as is falsely
suggested) in Colebrook, by invitation of my Landlord, where with one M Cole I
played at Tables for two pints of wine: And having played for the same wine, we
did agree to play five games at Tick-tack for five shillings, which he won,
and received of me; and then we agreed to play another game, as before: In the
middle of which game M. Cole played foul; upon which I took up the stakes, and
after some discourse he acknowledged his error; I returned his stake to him
again, and he promising to play forth the game, I laid down a twenty shilling
piece of my own, which he immediately took up, and affirmed he had five
shillings in the said piece (I reasoning with him) he called the Vintner, and
told him he had five shillings in the said piece, which the said Vintner
affirmed, though he was ignorant of the whole matter, upon which occasion we
begun the quarrel, but I by force wrested my piece out of his hand, though they
were both against me. Then the Mistres of the house with other servants, came
presently into the room, where we were, which also fell upon me, so that I was
much abused, and thrown down there, being so many upon me; I acknowledge I was
constrained to kick, and use such means I could to free my self, as I say upon
the ground, which the Author of the Vindication was pleased to call kicking
the Mistres of the house on the face, which I am altogether ignorant of, when I
was free, and being enraged, and in the heat of my blood (I confess) fetched my
Rapier, my man, and one of my fellow soldiers to assist me, and went to the
said Inn, and asked for the Vintner, and the said Cole, at which time passion
being on both sides more prevalent then reason, I drew my Rapier, and there
were some blows on both sides, and I think some few drops of blood was drawn,
and one of them showing a little scratch or prick, as if with a pin, out of
which came a drop of blood or two; and it was alleged by them, that I laid
felony to their charges, and that they had taken twenty pound from me; but I
presently answered, That I rather said, or at least intended twenty shillings,
and never declared it to* be any more: Which passion being over, I have here
laid open for truths sake my extreme folly, which I do not so much as in a
thought justify, but condemn, as the evil consequence of so bad exp^nce of
time. But to go on with my Relation, both parties thought themselves abused,
and by a Warrant I brought them before a Justice of peace nigh Colebrook,
before it was fully reconciled, but for your better satisfaction, I shall
insert under the Justices hand, viz.

Bucks. These are to certify all, whom it may concern, That whereas a
controversy was betwixt Corporal William Tompson of Captain Pitchfords Troop
in Colonel Whalies Regiment, and M. Tho. Cole of Wraysborough in the County of
Bucks, Tho. Sill, Will. Woodfind, Will. Moors, Phillip the Ostler, Mistress
Milles, and other servants to the same Mistress Milles in Colebrook in the said
County, who all appeared before me, I have heard fully the allegations and
proofs of both sides, and upon the whole matter did find cause to move the
parties on both sides, to agree the business amongst themselves, and they are
agreed. Accordingly in witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand this second
day of September. 1647.

Tho. Bulstread.


But notwithstanding this my Captain having some prejudice against me, sinc^ he
has declared, in regard I did appear in the prosecuting against Lieutenant
Savage, as a Dissenter at New Market from the engagement of the Army, being it
seems glad of such an opportunity, improved his time to bring the business fresh
upon the stage, and went himself to the house to enquire of it, and though in
my hearing the parties in the house, declared they were agreed before a Justice
of Peace, yet he it may be fearing the want* of such an opportunity to cast me
out, procured a relation of the business, and himself complained of it to a
Council of War, consisting of some of the Officers of that Regiment. At which
Council I did declare being examined of the truth of the peoples relation,
something was true, and some false, and also urge the argument that was between
us, as aforesaid, so I was commanded to withdraw, after the debating of the
business I was called in, where Rob. Swallow Major, being president of the
Council, did a little enlarge himself in expressing the great favor toward me
in consideration of that experience, which they had of my good service to the
Parliament and Kingdom: then a paper was read, to which I was required to set
my hand, which was an acknowledgement of a Scandal to the house, which after I
had perused, I told them, though the difference was ended before, yet if this
might put a full period to the matter, I was willing to subscribe it. The Major
answered, the business was ended, upon consideration whereof, I set my hand to
it: And being thus surprised, then the Major said in these words, M. Tompson,
the Council have further ordered, that for your abuse to the servants of the
said Mistres Mills, you are to be cashiered at the head of the Regiment, the
next Rendezvous. In the mean time you are to be disarmed, and to be committed
into the Marshals hands, I replied, I thought it was hard measure, and the
like. Notwithstanding which I was committed into the Marshals hands by an order
under the Majors hand, which I shall insert, viz.

You are hereby required to receive into your charge and safe custody the body
of. Will. Tompson, who is committed by order from the Council of War, and him
to keep carefully, until further order from the said Council, fail not. Dated
this 14. of September, 1647.

To the Marshall of Colonel Whalies Regiment, or to his man either.
Rob. Swallow.


There was a Rendezvous the next Tuesday following at Ripply in Surrey, at
which Rendezvous there was a Muster, but the Marshall having no order, brought
me not thither, but I was put forth the Muster Roll, and another Mustered in my
place: and my man in actual service in the Troop, was also denied the Muster,
though there were some arguments used by the Troop in my behalf to be Mustered,
yet it could not be granted; yet though they denied me the privilege of a
Soldier, I was continued in the Marshals hands, some sixteen or seventeen
days; after which time the Marshall received an order to dismiss me, under
the Majors hand; upon the receipt of this order, I went to the Troop, and looked
upon my self in the condition of a Soldier, till the sentence was executed upon
me: but having some discourse with the Major, my Captain, and other Officers
about it, they told me I was cashiered the Rendezvous aforesaid; then I
demanded a reason of my imprisonment, since that time, they not being able to
give me any reason, knowing that they had either wronged me in not Mustering me
as a Soldier, or else in keeping me in prison, not being in the condition of a
Soldier; Yet they manifested much bitterness in their hearts against me, by
menacing words; and withal, Capt. Pit^^ord struck me, and they refused to
suffer me to have any Quarters in the comp^sse of the Regiment: yet I told them
I should look upon my self in the condition of a Soldier, until their own
sentence was executed upon me; in which time I received an order from my
Captain, to depart the Quarters of his Troop: but I returned him answer, until
such time as the sentence was executed, I should look upon my self in the
condition of a Soldier, and so subscribe my self to be under his command, to
do my duty in my place: So I continued in the Quarters of the Troop, until
such time as there was a Rendezvous at Odium, in Hampshire, the Colonel being
there, some of the Troop moved him concerning my business, after much debate,
alleging some things in my own behalf, viz. The testation under the Justices
hand, and the Generals own order made at Northampton, and my imprisonment by
them, and denying to muster me: The Colonel told me, I might appeal to the
Council of War, at the Headquarters, if I conceived the Regimentall
Council had done me any wrong: I answered, I thought that remedy would be
worse then the disease, being that I must accuse the whole Council, I could
expect little remedy there: so with other arguments, did press him earnestly
to take it into his serious consideration; after al which discourse, the
Colonel drew forth the Troop, and read a Letter that came from the General, in
the behalf of Lieutenant Savage before mentioned, to be readmitted into the
Troop: but the Troop d^claring their readiness to obey the General in all his
lawful commands; yet they did humbly conceive, That the said Lieutenant was
guilty of being ca^hiered at the least: The Colonel perceiving the Troops
unwillingnesse to accept of the said Lieutenant, he used this as an argument,
that in case they would accept of the Lieutenant, they should have Tompson to
be their Corporal as formerly; in all which time I spoke not a word by way of
appeal to the Regiment, as is falsely suggested in the paper, entitled, The
Vindication, etc. Therefore you may see my offense was not in it self
unpardonable, in case the Troop would have accepted of the said Lieutenant, but
the Troop pressing to have a legal trial for both, and said that was all they
desired. The Colonel being offended with the Troop that they would not accept
of his proffer, went from them, but withal promised a legal trial for both,
these words was spoken in the head of the Troop, by the Colonel: but a
question was asked him, how I should do for Quarters in the mean time? The
Colonel ordered I should Quarter with the Troop, but he departing the Field,
the Major with other Officers of the Regiment, called me unto them in the head
of the Regiment, and commanded me to dismount, I replied my Horse was my own,
and if he pleased he might pull me down, but he went on and caused the sentence
of cashierment to be executed in the head of the Regiment; after the execution
whereof, I did not esteem my self (nor of right was) a Soldier of the Army. Yet
conceiving my self extremely injured in my reputation, I did declare in the
head of the Regiment my integrity to the Liberty and Freedoms of England, and
theirs and my fidelity to the Army, not as is scandalously suggested, to
persuade the Soldiers to resist their Officers, I not speaking any thing to
that effect, but to clear my self of that seeming guilt, which cashierment
might have cast upon me.

After this being no Soldier, I repaired to my own ordinary occasions, leaving
the Army within three or four days at the most: But I dare speak in the face
of the World, That I challenged not the exercise of my Office after that time;
being after this for sundry weeks about my own bu^inesse, as a freeman of
England; but their falling out not long after in the Army, some difference
concerning the Engagements for the Peoples Freedoms, and I freely confess, an
absolute dissatisfaction in me of the ruling part of the Army, which
constrained me to act contrary to their proceedings; and I went down to
Colonel Fleetwoods Regiment, when they were in Suffolk, and carried with me
the Agreement of the People, and some other papers, and declared in the head of
that Regiment (not as Mersenary Soldiers, but as freeborn Englishmen) to
Colonel Fleetwood and the rest of the Officers and Soldiers my full dislike of
the present actions then in the Army, and finding an opposition of the said
Colonel and his Officers, I more particularly applied my self to the
Soldiers and Agitators, as having a Letter directed unto them from some
freemen of England, which was read in the head of the Regiment, but Colonel
Fleetwood and his Officers, did endeavor to dissuade the Soldiers from
hearkening unto any thing that should be spoken, though neversomuch for the
preservation of themselves and the Kingdom, for that only was purely and
simply my end in whatsoever I delivered unto them, yet did not appear amongst
them as an Ad^utator, as falsely laid to my charge: but in our discourse it was
questioned, what I was, and from whence* I came, It was answered by some that
did know me well, That I did belong to Colonel Whalies Regiment, and this was
the sum of what past concerning that particular to my best remembrance. Then
after the Rendezvous at Kingston, I came to Captain Pitchford, and desired of
him a Certificate for the time, how long I had been under his command, but his
answer was he could not until he spoke with the Colonel, so he appointed me
the next day to wait upon him, which I did accordingly, and at Kingston we met
with the Colonel, but when he see me, all that he said unto me, was only this,
He commit thee, with some other menacing words, and would not admit me to
speak one word for my self; The Marshall not being in town, he gave express
command to Captain Pit^^ford (who has since that time laid down his
Commission, and has been questioned by some of his Soldiers, for unjustly
depriving them of their pay, which he has received for them; who lives now at
the Star in Cheap Side) and his Cornet forthwith to carry me to Windsor, to the
Marshall General, which was accordingly done that night without any warrant,
or expressing any cause: within four or five days the Colonel with some other
Officers gave in Depositions against me, which to this day I never see; out of
which Henry Wealey Judge-Advocate, Brother to Colonel Whale, drew up a charge
against me, under this notion, Articles exhibited against William Tompson, now
or lately Corporal in Captain Pitchfords Troop, etc.

A Council of War was called, where Commissary General Ireton was present,
for the trial of my cause? Unto which Articles, I returned an answer, being no
member of the Army, from the place where I lived, declaring my self to be a
free Commoner of England, and no Soldier, according to the Sentence of the
Regimentall Counsel against me: and further I declared, That they had no
legal power of questioning me for any regal or pretended Crime whatsoever;
And I appeal unto the civil Law as my legal and compedent Judge: I
manifested my self to be ready to answer any charge that shall be lawfully
fyled against me, according to the justice of the same Law. But after much
Interrogation to prove me a Soldier, at last it was put to the vote in that
Counsel, but was carried in the negative, That I was no Soldier; yet I was
continued in the Marshals custody still as prisoner, but when they could not
prosecute against me under the notion of a Soldier, they drew up another
Charge against me, under the Notion of a Spy, and a seditious person,
fomenting distractions in the Army; unto which I returned an answer, something
suitable to my answer to their first Charge: and withal declaring, that I
conceiving those Articles were more envious then good, or proceeding from a
sound and Christian judgment, and withal demanded reparation for my unjust
imprisonment: at this Council, Lieut* General Cromwell was President, The
whole business was fully scand and debated with redoubled questions of
interrogatories, but I keeping close to my first principle, they cease to pass
any sentence at all upon me, but only refer the business to the General,
under the notion of their great favor and love toward me, by my Colonels
means and others in the Council, who spoke much in my behalf: their advice to
me was, That there was no way for me, but to cast my self down at the Generals
feet by way of Petition, and to confess my error in appealing to the Civil
Power for the trial of my cause, And the Judge-Advocate Sir Hardres Waller,
with others, told me if they should refer me to the Parliament, it would be my
ruin, but I having much discourse with most of the Officers at the
Headquarters, and could not receive no satisfaction in my conscience, I could
not petition: So I went to the General, and desired to know his Excellencies
pleasure concerning my enlargement, but he giving me no full answer, I went to
the Lieutenant General, declaring the whole nature of the business unto him,
who at that time seemed much to be affected with my relation, and appointed me
to wait upon him the next day, which I did accordingly, but he told me he could
do nothing in my business, so I asked him leave for two or three days to
supply my necessaries, which he granted me, I promising to return again as
prisoner; which accordingly I did, and was with the Judge-Advocate, and the
Marshals deputy; and there rendered up my self as before a prisoner, and lay two
nights in the same bed with my fellow prisoner; in which time, I delivered
enclosed in a letter to Master Rushworth the Generals Secretary to be delivered
to his Excellency, my plea and protest against the proceedings of his Council
of War against me. In which I gave his Excellency to understand therein,
that I acknowledge in them no jurisdiction over me, I being a free Commoner,
and that I would use all means, I could for my freedom Which said plea and
protest is since printed, and also reprinted in the 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51,
52. pages of Lieutenant Colonel John Lilburns late book, called, The peoples
Prerogative.
which the Author of the Vindication was pleased to term a breaking of
prison, and running away, contrary to my engagement, the which censure I leave
to the rational to judge of. After this I went about my lawful occasions, but
within short time, I heard of their exclamations against me, so I went to the
Lieutenant General at Derby house, and acquainted him with what I heard: after
much discourse I parted from him, he then was so far from imprisoning me,
that he was pleased to promise me many courtesies concerning my Arrears and
other things, and appointed me to that end to wait upon him at some other time,
which accordingly I did. And likewise several times met the Marshal General,
and had some discourse with him, and told him, I was ready to answer any thing
that could be legally laid to my charge. I an^ connfdent also, that Commissary
General Ireton was not ignorant of my being thus public for many weeks
together about Westminster Hall, where I spoke with Lieutenant General Cromwell
two or three times, who was seemingly ready to serve me, according to his
former expressions, but upon the 26. of February, I being about my lawful
occasions at the House of Commons door, to speak with a Member of the said
House, Lieutenant General Cromwell, and Commissary General Treton coming forth
of the House, I not giving any occasion either in word or action, was by them
committed prisoner to the Guard, at the said door, I asking the reason of this
my sudden constraint, the Lieutenant General told me, That I was a bold
impudent fellow, and he would pull down my high spirit, adding, he would take a
course with me; and leaving me in the cu^tody of the aforesaid Guard,
commanded an Ensign with a file of Musketeers, who by violence and force of
Arms, carried me prisoner to White Hall, without producing or alleging any
thing against me, but the bare Command of Lieutenant General Cromwell, where I
was continued in the Marshal Generals custody, till Febr. 1. before any thing
was laid to my Charge: upon which day I was called before a Council of War in
White Hall, where the General was present, with several other of the general
Officers, I being called into the Council, I demeaned my self with all
civillity and respect, as they were Gentlemen, but withal declared, that I
could not in the least submit unto them, as a Court having power to take
Cognizance of any real or supposed crime that could be laid to my charge,
being by their own Votes no Member of the Army; but I declared, That if they
had any thing to lay to my Charge, the ordinary Courts of Justice were all open
and free, where I should be ready to answer what could be legally objected
against me: but they not regarding what I said in this nature, went on to
proceed against me, according to Marshall law, though it is now a time of
Peace. They asked me several Questions concerning my letter and my plea, which
at Windsor was delivered to the General, and whether I would own it or no? I
declared, I did own it as my Act, and give it in, as my ultimate resolution;
but Lieutenant General Cromwell, asked me, if I was a Gentleman free Commoner,
which I took as a jeer, and asked him, if that the word free Commoner was
become a derision amongst them that did pretend to be a Court of Justice? Upon
which he called me a mutinous fellow, and began to make an Apology for himself,
concerning taking me from the House of Commens door, who did not scruple to
say, That was the first time he see me since I had run from Windsor; but I
going to make an answer to what he spoke, he bid me hold my tongue: The
Iudge-Advocate began to read my Protest, so at present I was deprived to give
him an answer; but when the Judge-Advocate had made an end of reading, I told
him of his great mistake, as is before mentioned, concerning his first time of
his meeting with me, then he told me, I was not so good as my word, in not
keeping on my Hat according to my protest, I answered there was no time past,
but that I might perform my promise in that particular: then turning to the
General told him, I had nothing more to declare unto them then what I had
already said, so I should humbly take my leave.

So going toward the door, I put on my hat, but Richard Laurence Marshall
General, in the presence of his Excellency and the Council, struck me a box
on the ear, and also struck off my hat, and laid violent hands upon me; after
which I manifested my self more resolvedly, declaring them to be actual
destroyers of the Laws and liberties of England, and so were become the
greatest Apostates in the World; for they had declared to preserve the Laws
and liberties as aforesaid, in all their Engagements and Remonstrances,
published to the view of the Kingdom, upon which I threw Magna-charta and the
Petition of Right upon the Table before them, then presently Lieutenant
General Cromwell commanded I should be taken away and laid in Irons, and I was
presently forced into a little room nearby, where I continued with a guard upon
me; but within some few hours I was called to come into the Court but I denied
to go, saying, That I could not be so much a traitor to my own and the Kingdoms
liberties, as to betray them into the hands of tyrants; and further I said, My
legs should not be so much serviceable to my body as to carry me: But
notwithstanding this, the Marshals men told me, If I would not go, they must
carry me* so I being not able to resist their power by reason of their
strength, I resolved to manifest my integrity to my native Countries Freedom by
being merely passive in their hands, whereupon I set me down, and they carried
me by the legs and arms before the General, and as they brought me, so I lay:
then Commissary General Ireton begun to ask me several questions; but I
replied, I scorned to answer him in the least to betray my liberty as
aforesaid; and withal declared, I was merely in their hands because they were
stronger then I, even in the same nature of Thieves and murderers: But he
continued in asking me questions as I lay upon the floor, I stoping my ears,
and denied to hear them, they carried me back in the same nature as they
brought me in; after some two or three hours, I was called in again to go hear
my sentence, but I being passive, they, carried me in as before mentioned; but
the General then was gone, I was commanded to stand up, but I told them, That I
was unwilling my legs should bear me to stand before them: but by force I was
holden up, then I stopped my ears, they commanded my hands should be pulled from
my ears, then I said unto them, They might murder me if they would, for I was
in their power. And I further said I scorned their mercy, and despised their
cruelty, for it was all one to me to die by a sword, bullet, or halter from
them, as from a common enemy; while I was thus speaking, the Judge-Advocate
read three Articles of War, the first was, That no man shall utter any words of
sedition or uproare, upon pain of death. The second was, That no man should
stay above three days in the Army, except he was actually listed in some Troop
or Company, upon pain of death. The third was, That no man shall contemn the
Court when they are sitting in Court of Justice, upon pain of death: he further
said, The Council had found me guilty of those three Articles, and I must die
for it, and the Council had done me so much favor, as I should be shot to
death. I answered in these words, Be it known unto you that I scorn to beg
favor at your hands, or to petition for my life, I said my blood would be
required at their hands; then the Lieutenant General asked me, by whom, I said
surely the Righteous God will revenge the guilt of innocent blood: but then
they expressed their great sorrow for me, I answered, I did not value their
sorrow, but wished them to be sorrow for themselves, and be careful to keep
their heads on their shoulders; and withal I said unto them, That the God whom
I served, would make me able and also willing to be cast into the hottest
fiery-furnace, that they could provide for me, rather then I should stoop or
kneel in the least, unto that Image which they endeavor to set up; thereby to
betray the Liberties and Freedoms of my dearest Country, in the hands of
Tyrants and oppressors; Then Lieutenant General Cromwell commanded that I
should be kept close prisoner, and that I should not be admitted to have either
pen, ink or paper; which was accordingly obeyed. The Marshal-General gave
command that I should be cast into the low prison, and to be laid in Irons. Yet
they have not allowed one farthing of maintenance since the time of my first
imprisonment.

Thus courteous Reader I have given you a clear and impartial relation of the
substance of all that ever was objected or alleged against me, from the
beginning until this present day; in which I have not in the least endeavored
to clear my self from the fruits of infirmity or passion. But as for the
scandals fixed upon me in the later end of that paper, called, The Vindication,
concerning my communicating of other men's goods and doing what I will, I
conceived arises from my own folly in the quarrel, at the first spoken of; I
desire my life may not be measured by one simple action; for such contentious
as aforesaid, are certainly rather from passion, then solid reason, and yet I
might probably live: if one without sin or folly were to throw the first stone
at me, I have not in the least endeavored to throw dirt upon any, but give a
clear and full relation of the whole business, though in many particulars
against my self; for which if I have deserved punishment, I desire to suffer it
in a lawful way. If any shall question the truth of this relation, I desire my
life should depend upon no surer foundation, then the truth hereof.

And thus taking my leave, whether living or dying, I shall by Gods gracious
assistance, persist in the profession of my integrity to my dearest Countries
Liberty and Freedoms, with faithfulness to those principles, which the Army
under the Command of Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX, (who are now my Judges) once Declared.

Dated at White Hall (the place of my illegal captivity) the 12. day of March,
1647. William Tompson.
