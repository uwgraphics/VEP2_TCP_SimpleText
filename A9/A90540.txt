THE COPY OF A Letter sent from the Right Honorable the Lord PAGET, Lord
Lieutenant of the County of BUCKINGHAM, To the Right Honorable the Earl of
Holland: Showing the great readiness of that County, to obey the Ordinance of
the Parliament, touching the MILITIA.
My Lord,
I Have received so great expressions from my Countrymen of Buckingham-shire,
of their good affections to the Public, and ready Obedience to the Commands
of Parliament, in the present Muster this day begun for a fourth part of this
County, that I held it my duty to make your Lordship acquainted therewith, to
the end an account may be given of it to the Parliament, if your Lordship shall
think fit.

Ten of my Deputy Lieutenants met me this morning at Beckonsfield, where we
called over the Train Band, consisting but of one hundred and fifty men, who
made a very good appearance with their Arms and supplies, and as full as they
have been formerly upon any other summons. Besides these, eight score
Volunteers and upwards within this Division, presented themselves to us very
well armed, and exercised in two Companies; more in number then the Trained
Band, summoned to this place. I am also informed of another Company of an
hundred and fifty Volunteers more within this Division, that intend to show
themselves in our way to the next place of meeting, and of another Company of
an hundred more, who there intend to meet us, besides the Trained Band.

This public testimony of my Countrymens good affections, for the safety of
the King and Kingdom, I thought not unfit to make known. And rest

Your Lops most dutiful son, and humble servant, WILL: PAGET.
Beckonsfield 23. May. 1642.
