Counselor of the Rota, Touching these present Distempers OF ENGLAND, Wherein

With some signal Remarks upon the Nativity of CHARLES the second, etc.

LONDON, Printed in the Year, 1660.

A Letter sent from the City of Florence Written by a Great Counselor there,
touching the present Distempers of England, wherein He, with some of the Prime
Statesmen in Florence pass their Judgments which is the only way to compose
the said Distempers.
My Honored, and most Endeared Patron.
IT is no small diminution to my former happiness that I have not received
your commands any time these two months, which makes me lodge within me certain
apprehensions of fear that some disaster might befall you in those new
Distractions, therefore I pray be pleased to pull this thorn out of my thoughts
as speedily as it may stand with your convenience.

We are not here so barren of Intelligence, but we have weekly advice of your
present Confusions, and truly the severest sort of speculative persons here who
use to observe the method of Providence, do not stick to say, that the hand of
Heaven does visibly stir therein, and that those Distractions in Army, State,
and City are apparent Judgments from above, for if one revolve the Stories of
former Times as I have done many (but you more) he will find that it has bin
always an inevitable Fate which uses to hang over all popular Insurrections
to end in confusion and disorders among the chief Actors themselfs at last; And
we have had diverse examples thereof here among us, which has caused us to be
so long in quietness and peace.

But truly Sir, give me leave to tell you that your Nation has lost much of
their Repute abroad all the World over in statu quo nunc; Some do laugh at you;
Others do scorn, and hate you; And some do pity and comiserat you.

They who laugh at you, think you are no better than Madmen having strange
Magots in your brains bred out of the fat of so long wanton plenty, and peace.

They who scorn and hate you, do it for your Sacrilege, your horrendous
Sacrileges, the like whereof was never committed on Earth since Christianity
had first a hole to put her in.

They who pity you are few, and We are of the number of Them, as well in the
common sense of Humanity, as for the advantages, and improvement of Wealth
which this State has received by your Trading at Ligorne, for that Town does
acknowledge her prosperity, and that she is arrived to this flourishing Estate
of Riches, of Buildings and bravety by the correspondence she has had this
latter Age with England in point of Commerce, which yet we find does insensibly
impair evry day, and I believe you feel it more; Therefore out of the
well-wishes, and true affections we bear unto England, some of the most serious,
and sober'st Persons of this place who are well seasoned in the World, and have
studied men under diverse Climes, and conversed also much with Heavenly Bodies,
had lately a private Junta, or meeting whereunto I was admitted for one, and two
of us had bin in England where we received sundry free Civilities; Our main
business was to discourse, and descant upon these sad confusions, and
calamitous condition wherein England with the adjoining Kingdoms are at present
involved, and what might extricat Her out of this laberinth of Distractions,
and reduce Her to a settled Government; Having long canvas'd the business, and
banded arguments pro and con with much earnestness, all our opinions did
concenter at last in this point, That there was no probable way under Heaven to
settle a fast, and firm Government among you, then for the Men that are now
upon the Stage of power to make a speedy application to their own King, their
own Liege Lord and Soverain, whom God, and Nature has put over them; Let them
beat their brains, scrue up their wits, and put all the Policy they have upon
the tenterhooks as far as possibly they can, yet they will never be able to
establish a durable standing Government otherwise, They do but dance in a
circle all this while, for the Government will turn at last to the same point it
was before, viz. to Monarchy, and this King will be restored to his Royal
Inheritances Maugre all the Cacodaemons of Hell: Our Astrologers here specially
the famous Antonio Fiselli has had notes to look into the horoscope of his
Nativity, and what predictions he has made hitherto of him have proved true to
my knowledge, He now confidently averrs, with the concurrence of the rest, that
the aspect of all the stars, and conjunction of the Planetts much favor him
the next two years; Nam Medium caeli in Genitura Caroli secundi Regis Angliae
juxta axiomata Astrologiae Genethliacae dirigitur ad radios Sextiles Lunae Anno
Dom. 1660. and significat accessum ad Dominium, For the Medium caeli in the
Geniture of Charles the second according to the axioms of Genethliacall
Astrology is directed to the Sextile rays of the Moon and signifies an access
to Dominion. Add herunto that a most lucky conjunction follows the same year,
in the very Center of the said Kings horoscope betwixt Jupiter and Sol in the
month of September.

When I was employed by this State in Paris not many years ago, I had occasion
to make my address to your young King, and when I observed his Physiognomy,
and the Lineaments of his face, I seemed to discern in it something
extraordinary above vulgar countenances, and that he carried a Majesty in his
very looks, and noting besides the goodly procerity, and constitution of his
body he seemed to be cut out for a King.

Now, in point of extraction, and lineage it cannot be denied but he is one of
the greatest born Princes that ever was in the world, for whereas his
Gran-Father, and Father were allied only if you regard Foreign Consanguinity, to
the House of Denmark and the Guyses, this King bears in his veins not only that
blood, but also the bloods of all the great Princes of Christendom, being
nearly linked to the House of Bourbon and France, to the House of Austria, and
consequently to the Emperor, and Spain, as also to the Duke of Savoy, and our
Gran-Duke: Moreover he is nearly allied to all the greatest Princes of Germany,
as the Saxe, Brandenburg, Bavaria, the Palsgrave, and to the Duke of Lorain who
descends in the directest line from Charlemain; Add hereunto that the young
Prince of Orange, is his Nephew, and which is considerable he is a pure
Englishman born, whereas your two former Kings were Forreners. The Queen his
mother is of as glorious an extraction, which makes me admire the frontlesse
impudence of some of your poor Pamphletors who call her ever and anon the Little
Queen notwithstanding that the world knows Her to be the Daughter of Henry
the Great, and Queen of Great Britain, which Title and Character is indelible,
and must die with Her.

Hereunto may be adjoined, that this young King is now mounted to the Meridian
of his Age, and maturity of judgment to govern, and doubtless he is like to
make a rare Governor, having this advantage of all other Soverain Princes in
the world to have been bredd up in the School of Affliction so long, to have
Traveled so many strange Countries, and observed the humors of so many
Nations.

But to come to the Cardinal point of our Communication, after diverse debates,
and alterations how England might be brought to a stable condition of
tranquillity and perfect peace, to her former luster, and glory, the final
result of all, ended in this, that there was no other imaginable means to do it
then for you to make a timely and fitting humble address unto your own King,
and without question it is in his power to grant you such an absolut pardon,
such an abolition of all things passed, such a gracious Amnestia, such Royal
concessions that may extend to the security of every person for the future that
was engaged in these your revolutions, both touching his life and fortunes;
Unless their guilt of conscience be such that like Cain or Judas they think
their Sin is greater then can be forgiven them.

Now the mode of your application to Him may avail much, for if you chopp
Logique with him too far, and stand upon Puntillios, and too rigid terms, if
you show your selfs full of fears, jealousies, and distrusts it will entangle,
and quite mart the business, for in a Soverain Prince there must be an
Implicit, unavoidable necessary trust reposed by his peeple which all the Laws
that man's brain can possibly invent cannot provide against; Therefore if you
proceed in a frank, and confident true English way you may work upon his
affections more powerfully, and overcome him sooner so, then by any outward
Arms, This way will make such tender impressions upon him that he will grant
more then you can possibly expect.

Some Foreign Historians as the French Comines, and our Guicciardin do cry up the
English Nation for using to love their King in a more intense degree then other
peeple, and to regard his honor in a higher strain, to support which they have
bin always so ready, and cheerful both with their persons and purses; There is
now a fair opportunity offered to rake up the embers of these old affections,
and to recover the Reputation of true Englishmen; There is no peeple but may
sometimes stand in their own light, go astray, and err, for Error was one of the
first frailties that were entayl'd upon Man (and his posterity) as soon as he
was thrust out of Paradis; It Is a human thing to err, but to persevere in an
error is diabolical; You shall do well and wisely to follow the example of the
Spanish Mule, who out of a kind of wantoness being gone out of the high beaten
road into a by path, which led her to a dirty narrow lane full of pitts and
holes, at last she came to the top of a huge hideous Rock where she could go no
farther, for before her there was inevitable destruction, and the lane was so
narrow that she could not turn her body back, thereupon in this extremity she
put one foot gently after another, and Crablike went backward until she came
again to the common road; This must be your course, by a gentle retrogradation
to come into the Kings high road again, and there is no question but He will
meet you more than three parts of the way, If you do not, truly in our opinions
you will precipitat your selfs down a Rock of inevitable destruction; For
Heaven and Earth are conspired to restore Him, and though all the Spirits of
the Air should join with you, you shall not be able to oppose it. I presume you
are not ignorant how the two great Monarks of Spain and France (which may be
said to be the main Poles whereon Europe does move) have comprehended him within
the private capitulations of peace, The Emperor has promised to wed his
quarrel, and there is no Prince or State in Christendom but would gladly reach a
friendly hand to restore him, being deprived of his birthright, and his Royal
indubitable Inheritance (as you your selfs confess) for observing the fifth
Commandment, for obeying his Father and Mother; From which Birthright he may
be said to have bin thrust out when he was in the state of Innocence, being but
in a manner a Child, and very young then.

Now touching your selfs I will not flatter you, but plainly tell you that you
have not one friend any where beyond the Seas, nay your great Confederate the
Swed (as I had good intelligence) could upbraid one of your Ambassadors that
are now there, that He had not washed his hands clean since they had bin
embrued in his Princ's blood.

The time that I sojourned in England I was curious to read your Annals, and to
make some inspections into your Laws, and Method of Government, as also into the
Genius of the peeple, and I find there is no species of Government that suits
better with the nature of the Inhabitants, the quality of the Clime, and
relates more directly to the civil constitutions, Laws, and Customs of the Land
then Monarchal; The I Will of Great Britain has bin allways a Royal Island from
her very Creation, from her Infancy, she may be said to have worn a Crown in
her Cradle, and although she had four or five Revolutions and changes of
Masters, yet she still continued Royal, whereunto alludes a saying that I
observed in your old Records, Britannia ab initio mundi semper fuit Regia, and
Regimen Illius simile illi caelorum: Great Britain has bin from the beginning
of the World Royal, and her Government like that of the Heavens.

Therefore, all these premises being weighed in the balance of true judgment you
shall do well, and wisely to recollect your selfs, and call in your hopeful
young King, whose Title your consciences do acknowledge to be unquestionable,
otherwise it is not only improbable but impossible for England to be Herself
again, and to be settled in any stable Government which may reach to posterity;
you may wind up your wits as high as you can, you may consult with your first,
second, and third thoughts, but you will never be able to settle a fixed
Government, you will be still at a loss, your Deputies will be like a skeyn of
ravell'd thread, you will be in a laberinth of confusions, and the end of one,
will be still the beginning of another.

To conclude, the current and concurrent opinion of all Ministers of State here
both Foreign and Florentine is, that if you do not make a timely application to
your King, you will have all the Princes of Christendom about your ears, and
what a sad calamitous Country, what an Akeldama will England be then? Therefore
if there be a true patriot, and public soul amongst you, if there be ever any
drops of true English blood running in your veins, or the least spark of
national fire and affections glowing in your bosoms toward your own dear
Country, prevent these imminent dangers, and invite your King by discreet and
moderat proposals; The gallant Samnit General could tell the Romans who had
over power'd them, that if they gave them easy and gentle capitulations they
would perform them, but if they would tie them to too high and strict terms, they
would observe them no longer then they cold have opportunity to break them.

Touching the affairs of Italy, we are like to have a general blessed peace
this side the Alps, and Lombardy who has bin so pitifully harassed a long
time, and has had her face so often scratched, is in a fair way to recover her
former beuty; Signor Giovanni Palavicino, and D. Lorenzo Minuccio convey their
most affectionat respects unto you, and so does

Your Entire, and Faithful Servant. F. P.
Florence this 12th, of October. 1659.
FINIS.
