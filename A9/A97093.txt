An Antidote AGAINSTMASTER EDWARDS HIS OLD AND NEW POISON.
THough God has given unto Mr. Edwards, parts and abilities, where with a to
acquire a comfortable life, in a just and good way, and wherein he might be
helpefull unto many, and hurtful unto none; nevertheless he seems
unhappily to have placed his contentment in being a Master and Comptrouler of
other men's judgments and practices in the worship of God, (wherein the Word of
God and a man's own conscience is only to govern): and thereupon (necessarily)
finding opposition from al consciensious people, he grows most passionately
impatient, and even violently madd against all such as either plead their
cause, or take their part; plainly manifesting, throughout the whole course of
his preaching and writing, that he would esteem it his greatest felicity, if he
could prevail with authority, or provoke any others to the perpetual
molestation and destruction, of all that will not (though against their
consciences) submit to those rules which he approves.

Now the piety and justice of this Honorable Parliament, having so lately
freed this long oppressed Nation, from this very kind of Tyranny, in the
Bishops and Prelaticall Clergy, and very many judicious, and considerate
persons (through a blessed opportunity, freedom of discourse, and cleerer
search of Scripture then heretofore) being fully satisfied in their
understandings, that to compel or restrain, any peaceable person in matters
of faith, and the worship of God, is as real a sin, and as odious in the
sight of God as murder, theft or adultery, and thereupon engaging themselves
in the just defense of liberty of conscience, Master Edwards his work (of
bowing all to his rule) falls out to be very difficult, and impossible (by any
arguments drawn from the word of God) to be effected, or proved just.

And this also, in steed of qualifying his spirit, or stopping him in his race,
has set him all on fire, that he rages like an Irish, ravenous and hungry
woolfe, deprived of his prey by generous and true English Mastives, that watch
both night and day to save the harmless and benefitiall sheep (the
Independants and Separatists) who from the beginning of these our troubles, to
this very day, have continually without repining contributed their fleece for
clothing, and their limbs and lives for nourishment, and strength, to preserve
not only their own liberties, but the just liberties of this Nation; Yet
nothing abaieth the madness of this prophet; but even (as is to be feared)
against his own conscience, and as if hired thereunto by some politic
Balacks, he flies from one hill to another, from authority to authority, has
his parables and his offerings, and Satan like, would tempt the Lord himself
to fall down and worship him, to go against his own declared will, and to
stir up a persecuting spirit in the Magistrate, against this his beloved
Israel, to compel them to worship him (as do the Hipocrites) against their
minds and consciences, then which nothing could be more abominable in his sight.

And though he cannot but see the hand of God against him, and that
notwithstanding all his opposition, or any others, the numbers of them are
daily increased, and that their faithfulness to the Parliament and
commonwealth, has caused them to grow in favor with all the People; though (if
he would speak his heart) he must as Baalam, perforce acknowledge there is no
enchantment against Jacob, nor any divination against Israel; no prevailing for
a coersive power, against this good people, in a time of refreshment from any
just Authority: Yet persists he in his ungodly resolution, and seeing and
knowing that God will by no means answer his eager desire, of cursing this
part of his people; he seems to grow desperate, and like as Saul when God had
cast him off, and refused to answer him, either by Vrim or Vision, be-tooke
himself to the witch of Endor, even so this most unhappy man, betaketh
himself to Machivillian policy, for execution of his cruel purposes against
them: and finding no just or judicious party that will afford him any
countenance, or assistance, he applies himself to any that hate them, though
enemies to the commonwealth, hazarding the doing of their wrok, so that with
them, and by them, he may but do his own, whereunto the weaknesses of many
well minded heople ministers to gerat an advantage, their rashness and to
easy credulity, being all the foundation which he has now left, to build his
hopes upon, for if these would but a while suspend their belief, and patiently
consider the things he has spoken or is about to publish, and would there upon
with draw themselves from his wicked and delusive counsels, and instead thereof
would fall to councelling of him to forsake his violent Railing, and reviling,
of a people they know to be faithful, it were then impossible for him to
effect his unjust designs, which also (if effected) must necessarily be the
bondage or ruin of all sorts of well minded people, as well Presbiterians as
others (however his charmings may for the present flatter them) that must and
will be the conclusion, if they continue to take in his poisonous counsels,
how pleasing soever they seem to a pallat corrupted by long costome; they are
poisonous, and will in time both swell and destroy them.

And therefore unto this sort of people, do I at this time principally
address this discourse by way of Antidote, to prevent the working of his
banefull Counsels, and to frustrate his accursed ends.

This unjust man, knows all just and judicious men, cannot but oppose his
unjust designs, and therefore it is, he has denounced so many of them by name
in his books, as his enemies, his ablest enenies they are, and the more
powerful, because they are all known to be really faithful to the
Parliament: In this case says Machivel there is but one help, that is. they
must be brought into disgrace, and disrepute, with the people, for if these
remain in credit, the people will give ear unto them, be rightly informed by
them and be in no capacity to be deceived: well says Mr. Edwards, how shall
they be sufficiently reproached: Why says Machivel, seek out unto your aid
honest zealous persons of godly life, and good repure in the world, such as you
know are fiery hot against errors and heresies so called, and unto them sadly
complain of the daily infinite increase thereof, and entreat their assistance
in the extirpation of them, and for that end desire them to collect their
memories, what they have heard in any discourse, what they have any ways
observed or known, to proceed from such and such men, naming divets, that are
taken and reputed to be either grand Heretics, and Schismatiques themselves,
or the defenders and maintainers of them, by word or writing, tell them you
have heard that such and such, hold and such blasphemous opinions, at such and
such a time uttered, such and such horrible speeches, pray them to consider how
exceeding necessary it is such things were known, and made public to all the
world, left through ignorance such blasphemous and heretical persons in time
get into offices of Magistracy, if not into the Parliament it self; lay before
thom the danger if it should be so, and entreat them (for prevention) that they
will thrust themselves into all meetings, companies, and societies, to provoke
discourses, and to take notice of what they observe, or can any ways learn of
any of them or any others, and it shall be your care to divulge them to the
world, in the strongest colors your Art can give them: And (says Machivel) as
they through eagerness, will over-heare and make things worse then they were
either spoken or intended, so it must be your care to make them rather wors
then better, then their relations, you must be sure to cast dirt enough upon
them, some will stick, and a little (amongst those you would pervert) will
suffice to blemish the clearest and most able amongst them, and to deprive them
of all credit and and repute for ever.

If you observe any man to be of a public and active spirit, (though he be no
Independent or Separatist) he can never be friend to you in your work, and
therefore you are to give him out, to be strongly suspected of whoredom, or
drunke^nesse, profaneness, an irreligious person, or an Atheist, and that by
godly and religious persons, he was seen and heard blaspheming the holy
Scriptures, and making a mock of the Ordinaces of Christ, or say he is
suspected to hold inteligence with Oxford, or any thing no matter what,
somewhat will be believed, you cannot be ignorant how much this has prevailed
against diverse able persons.

If you see any such man but once talking with a Papist, or (though not) you
may give out that very honest men suspect him to be a Jesuit: If any one but
demand of you or any others, how you know the Scriptures to be the word of God,
give it out for certain he denies them, or if any put questions concerning God
or Christ, or the Trinity, you have more then enough to lay accusations upon
them, that shall stick by them as long as they live, if you will follow this my
counsel thoroughly says Machivel (as in part you have done) you cannot fail
of your end, you can never want matter, you shall (amongst those you deceive)
be taken for a most zeaous, holy, and religious man, you may write book upon
book, great and large ones, and make good profit (or great renown) by them,
and in after ages, be recorded as a famous Author.

Moreover if you prosecute this course, you may happily hereby not only hold your
friends firm unto you, ready upon all occasions to petition what you would have
them, or to do any thing you shall require them, but you shall be sure to hold
them for ever divided from your adversaries, in all things, they shall not
regard any thing, though never so just or good, if they see they have but a
finger therein, nay if work wisely, you need not despair of dividing your most
powerful adversaries amongst themselves, doubts and jelousies being of great
force:

And you know it is an undoubted truth, a house divided within it self cannot
stand.

This is Machivels way; and this has been Mr. Edwards his way; and in this way
he goes on, but the way of God have they not known, or rather have they not
despised the way of the Lord.

This is the Poison by which he has envenomed the hearts and understandings of
thousands in themselves) honest, religious people, too too easily misse-led,
for want of knowledge or consideration of these Machivelian courses; men that
being sinceare in their own intentions, are easily deluded by the least
pretense of zeal and godliness.

And however his heart may be hardened that he will not regard any thing, that
has been written unto him; you that have been deceived by him, are not so
far gone but you may yet recover, and become untainted, with the least savor
of his spirit, and in time abominate his ways:

But surely then you must consider things more seriously then hitherto you have
done, you must suspect your own ways, and compare them once more with the
ways of God, commended to you in his holy Word; That is the only Antidote that
is able to expel the Poison you have taken, or shall be offered in his next
book; you know the word of God is mighty to the casting down of strong holds,
and to bring into subjection all Machivelian Imaginations.

I shall therefore pray you in reading his next book which (it is to be feared)
is reserved for an accursed purpose, and to second some work of Darkness;
that you will with open eyes see how far, and how plaufible Machivel may go
with colors of religion transforming himself into an Angel of light.

Also that you will not hastily give credit to any thing spoken by him a
professed adversary, lest in so doing, you become guilty of bearing false
witness against your neighbor.

That you will consider and mark those that cause divisions and offenses,
contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them: Romans 16. 17.

That you will mind a special part of that doctrine to be expressed in the
fourteenth Chapter thorow-out, and the beginning of the fifteenth, which I
entreat you to read without prejudice or preoccupation of judgment; and then I
cannot doubt, but liberty of conscience will appear more just in your eyes,
then it has done, and confess that your selves cannot live without it.

That you will lay to heart how dangerous it may prove to the Common wealth,
and to the cause you have hitherto jointly maintained, (God prospering you in
so doing) if by any policies you should stand divided from those your brethren
of other judgments; believe it, the hand of Joab is in all your divisions,
whatever you see or judge, your common enemy, is the fomenter of them; and
under what notion or colors soever they appear, they are a common enemy to
you both, that labor to divide you, and in the end, you will find it to be so
to your cost, if not to your ruin.

An ancient Philosopher (somewhat to this purpose) has a fable, That the
Wolves being at long and deadly war with the sheep, and not prevailing by
force; but contrary to their expectation almost vanquished: Resolved to try
what they could do by policy, and thereupon desired a treaty, which the sheep
simply and easily granted: The principal simply and easily granted: The
principal thing in the treaty, which the Wolves insisted on, was, that the
sheep would but discharge and send away their dogs, and then there would be no
cause of war at all, but they should live quietly one by another, urging
withal, that the dogs were of a quarrelsome disposition, had been the
beginners and continuers of the war, that they were of a different nature and
temper from the sheep, maintained the war only for their own ends, and in
probability were like enough to make a prey of the sheep themselves, and the
like; if they would discharge them, they would give them what security
themselves would desire, for assurance of their peaceable neighborhood. The
poor sheep soon weary of the charge and trouble of war* yielded thereunto, and
discharged their dogs, their strongest help, (whereby they had not only
preserved themselves, but by many battles and maine force had even quite
vanquished the Wolves) which was no sooner done, but the Wolves in short time
muster up their force, (the dogs being out of call) and when the sheep least
suspected, fell upon them and destroyed them utterly.

I conceive this could never have been effected, but that the Wolves had
conveyed some of themselves into sheep clothing, who by flattering and
dissembling carriage, got themselves into credit with the sheeps, and so
persuaded to this goodly treaty, and wrought them to those destructive
conditions.

And (if well considered) this fable (though dogs and Christians hold no fit
comparison) may demonstrate, that whosoever does, or shall endeavor to persuade
the godly and honest Presbyters to abandon, discourage or molest their
faithful, helpful, valiant and assured friends of other judgments (whom Mr.
Edwards would have to be used worse then dogs) they are at best, but Wolves, or
Wolves friends, and seek the destruction of all honest people, of what
judgment soever.

And whether. Master Edwards do expressly aim at so horrid an issue, or not;
for certain, his works and endeavors do mainly tend thereunto, and will help
on the wicked purposes of any that intend the destruction of the sheep.

But, blessed be God, we are not as sheep without a shepherd, we have had,
and still have faithful and resolved shepherds set over us by providence, in a
most just and orderly way, a Parliament (the terror of the wicked, and comfort
of the just) that for these 5. years and upwards, have been a strong Tower of
defense to the sheep of the Lords Pasture, to all the godly party in the Land:
and though many of our froward and weak sheep have many times been tampring
and harkening after offers and conditions as dangerous to the whole flock, as
the discharging of that strength, the Wolves most feared; yet has the wisdom
of those our faithful Shepherds hitherto prevented the same; and according to
the true rules of wisdom have made most use of those whom the Wolves most
feared.

And we trust the same God that endowed them with such a new modelising
wisdom, as has been successful to the astonishment both of their friends
and enemies, will still guide and direct them, when the policies of the
enemies, are most busy and strongly working; and when the weakness and
frowardness of their friends are most troublesome and importunate for
destructive things, yea though some should be wrought upon so far, as to show
a wearisomnesse of these their Shepherds; the same God will then we doubt not,
show his mighty power and wisdom in them, and thereby preserve this whole
Nation, from a most dangerous Relaps, which otherwise were to be feared:

The whole flock is their charge, God has made them Overseers of the whole,
and to our joy and comfort they have hitherto showed, agreater care to preserve
the whole People, then to please any part of them; in unreasonable things: and
in so doing they have been (and cannot but be) blessed and prosperous:

And notwithstanding Mr. Edwards his verlomous poison, blown abroad by his
unhappy quill, to blast and destroy the repute of honest, religious, and
faithful men, yet (the tree being known by his fruit) the Parliaments
wisdom expels his poison and shows no disrepect to any honest religious
person, and every juditious man follows their worthy example therein: and
when you that are weak and have been misled, and tainted with his poison, shall
consider it, your judgments I trust will be rectified, and strengthened so
sufficiently, that you will no longer judge of men according to his malicious
accusations, but according to their works and what you see them do:

Which if you do, we shall have done with his poisonous, and scandalous
books, which serve for nothing but to deceive and destroy the people; great
quientnesse will follow thereupon, and you will soon find a nearer way to a
final end of your troubles, then the wrangling way he has proposed, for if
once you were united you would have no enemies; your war would be at an end;
your peace would be sure, and all the people safe and happy;

Which is my only aim in this work and my most earnest desire: WILLIAM WALWIN

A GRAIN MORE, And no more.
OBserving by some passages and occurrences of late, that all the labor
bestowed toward the conversion and reducing of Master Edwards into a truly,
charitable, and Christian disposition, has proved no other, then as the
washing of a Blackamoore; and thereupon, daily expecting a poisonous issue from
his infectious brain. To prevent the mischief that might ensue: I prepared
this little Antidote, intending to have had it in such a readiness, as that it
should have met his poison in the instant he first spread it, wherein I did my
part, but the Printers mistake hindered it.

Those therefore that have read his new Gangrenous and scandalous book, and do
find themselves any whit tainted with the poison thereof, and have slept upon
it: My friendly advise is, that they take double the quantity of this Antidote:
that they read this little Treatise twice over, and consider every part of it
seriously and deliberately, and if they are any thing far gone, and in
danger: then it will be necessary they add thereunto a good quantity more of
true Christian love, it will be somewhat hard to find, there being abundance
every where of that which is counterfeit, the best of which will do more hurt
then good; and therefore it will be needful you get the help of some that by
experience can distinguish the true from the false, and such a one I can assure
you is also very hard to find: but without it there is no hope, and with it
there is infallible certainty of recovery.

If there were not much false and counterfeit love abroad, this wretched man
with all his cursed diligence could never have been furnished with matter to
have sweld his poisonous bulck to so vast a greatness.

And truly had those whoever they are that gave those malicious informations
concerning me, as he recites them if they had had, but one scruple of true
Christian love in them they never had administered to his (so unmanly) occasion.

I bless God, I have through diligent seeking found this precious liquor, and
have enough to spare upon those his unadvised intelligencers, and through the
power thereof can freely forgive their evil intentions, which my conscience
assures me, I never deserved from any, I ever conversed withal, or that ever
knew me.

As for himself, if passion and fore-judging did not blind men's
understandings, and that most men are transported with flashy fancies, and are
unapt to consider things judiciously, it would evidently appear, that he has
not in any measure auswered, either my Whisper or the Word more both which will
live in despite of his utmost venom, and will concern him, and all such
deceivers as he is, being there set forth in their truest colors, nor is his
neglect of them, any other but a device to keep men's eyes off from reading or
regarding them, wherein he has indeed dealt very pollitiquely, and like one
fully possessed with a true Machivillian spirit, which more evide^tly appears
in laying his charge upon me in such subjects, as wherein he knows the
presses in these times are not admitted the lest measure of freedom, and if I
should insist upon the mistakes, and nullities in the charge, I should be
enforced to use the names of some persons, I much esteem for that public
affection I have seen in them, and for the un-interupted frie^dship I have had
with them, which is no ways suitable to my spirit: insomuch as I am yet
unresolved what course to take, besides, since it concerns only my particular,
and that of necessity it will occasion a bulk in print beyond my temper, the
world being also oppressed with books of particular contest, I believe I shall
incline to forbear, though I am not certain.

As for those who know me, or thoroughly know him, with all those I shall remain
unprejudiced in my repute, though he should have spet al hisvenome at once, and
as for those that neither know him nor me, I shall (and I think may) safely
trust my credit to the operation of my Antidote, and to the most powerful
addition of true Christian love, which were there need in this cause) would cover
abundance of evil: love is the balsome which in my Whisper I really commended
to his use, but either he will not use it, or takes not that pains to rub it
in which I advised, but though I have cast my pearl amiss, and have sped
accordingly; that shall not hinder or abate my esteem of so precious a Jewel,
it is the delight of life, and the joy of Heaven, and whilst I live I trust I
shall live in love, and when I dye, that I shall dye in this love, and Rise and
remain Eternally in love, that is in God (for God is love) in whose presence
there is fullness of joy; at whose wright hand there are pleasures for
evermore; and full amends for all reproaches.
