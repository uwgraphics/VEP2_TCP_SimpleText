THE WORLD IS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN.
To the Tune of, When the King enioys his own again.
LIsten to me and you shall hear,
News has not been this thousand year:
Since Herod, Caesar, and many more,
You never heard the like before.
Holy Days are despised.
New fashions are devised.
Old Christmas is kicked out of Town.
Yet let us be content, and the times lament,
You see the world turned upside down.
The wise men did rejoice to see
Our Savior Christ's Nativity:
The Angels did good tidings bring,
The Sheepheards did rejoice and sing.
Let all honest men,
Take example by them.
Why should we from good Laws be bound?
Yet let us be content, etc.
Command is given, we must obey,
And quite forget old Christmas day:
Kill a thousand men, or a Town regain,
We will give thanks and praise amain.
The wine pot shall clinke,
We will feast and drink.
And then strange motions will abound,
Yet let us be content, etc.
Our Lords and Knights, and Gentry too,
Do mean old fashions to forgo:
They set a porter at the gate,
That none must enter in thereat.
They count it a sin,
When poor people come in.
Hospitality it self is drowned.
Yet let us be content, etc.
The serving men do sit and whine,
And think it long ere dinner time:
The Butler's still out of the way,
Or else my Lady keeps the key,
The poor old cook,
In the larder does look,
Where is no goodness to be found,
Yet let us be content, etc.
To conclude, I Will tell you news that is right,
Christmas was killed at Nasbie fight:
Charity was slain at that same time,
Jack Tell troth too, a friend of mine,
Likewise then did die,
Roast beef and shred pie,
Pig, Goose and Capon no quarter found.
Yet let us be content, and the times lament,
You see the world is quite turned round.
