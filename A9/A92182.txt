A few Words to all People concerning the present and succeeding Times.
Whosoever is wise amongst the People
Consider what I say;
Great things to pass the Lord will bring
In this the later day.
For now out of Captivity
shall little Judah walk,
And poor oppressed Israel,
with all her feeble folk.
Yea, now while Pharaoh does oppress
the Seed, which now must reign;
And Herod kills with distress;
yet all their work is vain:
Though Chaunting Priests with forgeries
poor silly souls delude,
Yet often God's Witness does arise
against what they intrude.
Though many people do backslide
from that which once they knew,
And, with the wicked now deride
God 's servants, who are true.
Though we l^ke sheep appointed are
to suffer at man's will,
Yet dying we the Truth declare,
though men our bodies kill*
It is God's ^^^ness in each man
in secret shall arise
To plead for us, when no man can
for Conscience peace devise.
When we in Prisons are oppressed,
and from the Rulers sent,
God's Witness then does break their rest,
to move them to repent
Oh! happy now dear friends we are,
who have obeyed the Light,
Which does for us our cause declare,
when we are out of sight.
Yea, this I say, for ever blessed,
and none shall take our Crown,
Nor yet deprive us of our rest,
by treading of us down.
Let now Jerusalem rejoice,
her children shall be free.
They now do hear the Bridegrooms voice
and Zions King they see*
Who does the Prison-doors unlock
down in the Dungeon deep,
He pierces through the hardest Rock,
that he our souls may se^k*
Into his bosom now return
all ye that with me weep,
And do in secret with me mourn;
the Lord our soul will keep.
Let no high thought in us be found,
lest it lift up our mind;
But in true humbleness abound,
for here true peace we find.
In Aegypt's darkness wise men talk,
who do the Light despise,
While we in Goshen in it walk,
in whom it does arise.
That which the Prophets did foretell,
and good men prayed should be,
Now in it with the (...) we dwell,
in measure as we see.
Our boldness great, and confidence,
in weakness does arise,
As we do keep in the true sense,
which does the World despise.
When we before the Rulers stand,
none think what then to say;
The Lord our strength is near at hand
to guide us in that day.
Yea, when the Lord does stop our speech,
we waiting in his fear,
Our patience shall God's Witness reach,
when men no words shall hear.
For Christ in silence like a Lamb,
did to the (...) come,
And as a sheep (...) the shearer,
so did he then stand dumb.
False ^udgemens on him wise men gave,
th^^ did his life condemn,
In scorn they brought him to the grave,
and did the Truth contemn.
God's Martyrs dear in every place,
like sufferings under-went,
When they were used with disgrace,
yet they abode content.
Now is the time of suffering
begun in the last day,
Which shall the Beast to ruin (...),
and'^ Kingdom must decay.
Although destruction be in hand
for us a people poor,
It will bring darkness over the Land
in which shall die the Whore.
And Antichrist with all his train
with toil themselves shall vex,
For they shall see their Labor's v^in
God's servants to perplex.
All Babels Rulers sore shall grieve
At that which they shall see,
When none their City can relieve,
destroyed it must be.
Strong is the God that will annoy
thee with his vengeance sore,
And in his fury thee destroy,
where thou shall cry and roar.
The time is short thou have to reign,
though thou sit'st like a Queen,
Yet thou shall perish in disdain;
the like was never seen.
Thy Kingdom now is very dark,
and blackness does abound,
It Is now too late for thee to hark*
repentance cannot be found.
When sentence past, none can reverse,
the King of Heavens Decree,
Thy scoffing cannot make it less,
what he will do with thee.
At his approach thy strength shall fail,
thy stubborn heart shall mourn,
With horror then thy self bewail,
for thou shall be forlorn.
Thy lying mouth shall then be shut,
thy vaunting turned aside;
Thou from thy Lovers shall be cut,
then down shall come thy pride.
Thy wise men and thy Captains all
together so combine,
That ye together all may fall
within a little time.
The Work is such you do oppose,
so weighty and profound;
The like before it never rose,
your wisdoms to confound.
No Weapon forged, now shall stand
against God's chosen One,
Whose iron Rod is in his hand,
For he must reign alone.
Yea, all that will not bow to him,
in shivers must be broke;
For he will shatter every Limb
with his destroying stroke.
The Child is born this Work shall ^^e
eff^cted in this kind,
And suddenly these things shall be;
for little is behind.
Yea many are the Children young
who shall these things behold,
And are the Nations yet among,
but God will all unfold:
And to his little ones reveal
his wonders great and strange;
What he will do, that he may heal
the Nations at their change:
How Kings and Princes shall bow down,
their glory then forsake;
And at their feet shall cast their Crown,
that they may now partake
With him and those who have been poor,
and whom this World despise;
Yet of true Riches they have store,
though they walk in disguise.
The Jews who would Messiah know
and are as yet behind,
In them the Light now dawn will show
where they they the Christ may find.
The Gentiles who in darkness have
been buried in their sin,
Shall now come forth of that dark grave
where long time they have been.
Now is the time for Jews to turn,
and Gentiles to awake;
In many hearts the Light does burn,
which shall all Nations shake.
Yea Kings and Kingdoms they shall reel,
Light shall their Powers rent,
Great strivings in them they shall feel,
to move them to repent.
No Laws man makes can Light arrest,
nor Prisons it contain:
No Banishments can it oppress;
In Conscience Light must reign.
The Gallows, Sword, Faggots and Fire,
these Instruments are vain,
With which man may himself out-tire
yet still the Light remain.
God's Witness true in this last age,
by whom he will contend
With Kings and Rulers in their rage,
that so they may amend,
And set his captive people free,
their Conscience to enjoy,
That they may have their liberty,
and none may them destroy.
Oh happy Nation where thy King
and Rulers shall bow down
Unto the Light which now does spring,
they shall receive the Crown
Of immortality and bless
which never shall away.
Their honor then shall be endless,
and glory not decay.
But England yet into thine ears
this dreadful voice I send,
That thy destruction's very near,
if thou do not amend.
All Sodom's sins in thee are found,
the old world's wicked way;
Iniquity does now abound,
God's people to destroy:
Nothing thou do so much neglect
as truth and righteousness.
God's ways thou wholly do reject,
and love wickedness.
All whoredoms drunkenness and Oaths,
in these are thy delight;
And all that God and good men loathes
is pleasant in thy sight.
Oh! England do not so forget
God's mercies toward thee.
A little time is left thee yet
that happy thou may be;
If thou do suddenly repent,
and from thy sins depart;
Embrace God's truth which he has sent,
and it will change thy heart;
But if thou stubbornly go on,
yet hear what I do say,
The Lord will not let thee alone,
but he will bring a day
Of bitter howling over thee,
in which thou shall lament,
The time which cannot recalled be,
that then thou may repent:
Against thee then God will reveal,
his wrath shall thee destroy,
In his displeasure with thee deal,
then perish shall thy joy.
For with strange plagues, sword and famine
the Lord will with thee plead;
Yea then thus he will examine
thee suddenly with dread.
Oh Land! thou fruitful, thou shall pine,
thy Cities must decay;
Thy people proud, who are so fine,
their glory shall away,
Oh London! great shall be thy woe,
who shall lament thy case?
For in thy streets (...) grow
God will thee so debase:
For thy oppression, and thy pride,
for thy backsliding state;
For that the truth thou do deride,
and goodness thou do hate:
For that thou do God's servants beat,
imprison, and misuse;
The simple-hearted thou do threat,
and innocent abuse:
Religion now with thee is vain,
Idolatry has place;
Lukewarmness is embraced again,
and all that may disgrace
God and his truth, Christ and his Lambs*
it may be found in thee:
And all that can increase truths bands
by wickedness is free:
Who is oppressed save righteous men,
who in vile prisons lie;
Arise, O God, for these things then,
yea loud now is the cry
Of thine Elect in every place,
How long Lord, Holy, True:
Will thou not hasten on thy pace,
against the wicked Crew.
Yea this I say, let all awake,
the day is very near,
In which God will in vengeance shake
the Earth, that all may fear.
Let Kings and Judges now be wise;
let all men soon repent;
Let sinners from their rest arise,
the night is now far spent;
The great day of the Lord's at hand*
who shall abide his ire;
Or who before him then shall stand,
who is devouring fire.
Then Kings and Captains, bond and free
shall at his presence quake;
Then all into dark holes would flee,
when he the Earth shall shake:
Then in the ragged Rocks and Caves
you will seek a place to hide,
Who use God's People worse then slaves,
then they not you will abide.
Even then when Earth in fire shall burn
and Elements melt with heat,
When heavens like scrowls away shall turn
God's anger then shall threat:
Because his patience then shall cease
to all his enemies,
And only judgments shall increase
to all Eternities:
Where gnashing teeth with weeping cries
for evermore shall be
To such as do God's truth despise,
and follow vanities.
Oh now dear suffering friends rejoice!
Redemption will not stay
From us who have made Christ our choice,
before the evil day,
When Prisons, Sword, Gallows and Fire
shall compass us about,
He will help us when in the mire,
and guide us when we doubt.
All tender Friends I dearly greet
you in the Lord of Life;
And in his patience which is sweet,
fare well where is no strife.
Yea in that Love which suffers long,
for ever let us dwell;
And in God's Truth let us be strong,
in this I say farewell.
The last day of the 4th month, 1662. JOHN RAUNCE.
