A true Relation of the Great Victory obtained by Gods Providence, by the
Parliament Forces, etc.
Honored Sir,
That I may give you an account of our proceedings at Thurland, you may
understood that Sir John Girlington having drawn (...) into his Castle of
Thurland, he began to pl^^^^^ the Country, and to commit Robbery and
Murders, and thereupon for the suppression of him and his adherents, I
repaired thither, and after seven weeks straight siege of the Castle, it was
delivered unto me, to be demolished upon agreement, to suffer him and all his
in the Castle, to pass away with their lives, and goods: During most part of
the siege, the greatest part of the Forces of Westmerland lay within our view,
and daily threatened us; but God confined them to their own County, and every
day more, and more inclined the hearts of the Commons of Westmerland to decline
any Attempt upon us, though we then lay in an Out Angle of our County, far from
Sapplies, and whilst these things were in suspense, a Design was set on foot
by all the Malignant Gentry of Westmerland and Cumberland, and by Roger Kirby,
and Alexander Rigby of the Burghe, two Lancashire men, to raise all the Forces
of Cartmell and Fournes, part of Lancashire, to join with Cumberland and
Westmerland, to surprise Lancaster and Hornby Castles, and to assault us on all
sides, and to raise our Siege, and then to proceed further into Lancashire, and
(as upon credible information I believe) to join with Latham house, and all the
ill affected in our County, to our general devastation. And for this end, they
drew together part of Cumberland forces into Fournes, and with them the
Strength of that place, to about the number of sixteen hundred, intending the
next day to March into Cartmell toward us, and there to add to their forces,
and in their way, they took and imprisoned diverse of the best affected, and
caused the rest of them to fly out of the Country, who posting to us, I
forthwith took five hundred foot, two Drakes and three small Troops of Horse,
parcel of my Forces at Thurland, and with them in one day, I Marched almost
thirty miles, over mountains, and through Sea-sands, and waters, within two
miles of the Enemy, and the next morning being the Lords day, we found the
Enemy in the Field, standing with a Body of Horse, and another of Foot, in a
posture to receive us, upon a ground chosen for their own advantage: and when
we were within half a mile of them, we committed our selves to Gods protection,
and began our work with public prayers for his blessing upon us: And those
done, we speeded unto the Enemy, with such Resolution and Courage in all the
Captains, and Common Soldiers, as by their deportment, I might have rather
deemed, that they had made have to have saluted their friends, then to have
encountered their enemies: the enemy, word was ( In with Quecn Mary) ours was (
God with us) and at our first appearance, God so struck the hearts of these our
enemy, with terror, that before a blow given, their Horse begun to retreat,
our foot gave a great shout, our Horse pursued, theirs fled; their foot
dispersed, and fled; they all trusted more to their feet, then their hands;
they threw away their Arms and Colors, deserted their magazin drawn with eight
oxen, and were totally routed in one quarter of an hours time; our horse slew
some few of them in the pursuit, and drove many of them into the Sea; we took
their Colonel Hudleston of Millam, two Captains, and an Ensign, and about four
hundred Prisoners, six foot Colors, and one horse Color; and their Magazin,
and some horses, and more arms then men: and all this without the loss of any
one man of ours; we had only one man hurt by the Enemy, and only another hurt
by himself with his own Pistol, but neither mortally; upon the close of the
business, all our men with a great shout cried out, Glory be to God; and we
all, except one Troop of horse, and one foot Company, which I left to quiet the
Country, returned forthwith toward our siege at Thurland; most of our
Horsemen without alighting from our horses, and most of us all, without eating
or drinking; so that early the next day we came again to Thurland, where we
found our siege continued, within view of more then treble forces from
Westmerland, this work in Fournes had that influence upon all the Castlers,
and all the Gentry of Westmerland, and Cumberland, who then lay within our
fight at Kirby-Loynsdale, that within two days after, the Castle was by the
Negotiation of Sir Philip Musgrave, then commanding in chief in Westmerland
and Cumberland, agreed to be rendered unto me, to be demolished, which is
accordingly done: And though I endeavored to have preserved all the
combustible materials therein from fire, yet I could not therein prevail with
the common soldiers without great displeasure.

My humble suit now is, to have the order of the House of Commons for my
indemp^ity, for demolishing of the Castle: And because Colonel Hudleston (who
yet has a Regiment in Yorkshire, in or near Hallifax) is as I hear Sergeant
Major General of Cumberland; and the most considerable man in Cumberland, and
our next neighbor to Lancashire, and one whom without further danger to the
peace of our county, I cannot conceive can be kept Prisoner here, I have
therefore presumed to send him uno you, under the care and custody of Mr.
Robert Fog, of whose industry and fidelity, both you and we here have had much
experience: Sir, that God may bless, and prosper all your designs, and
proceedings for his glory, and the peace of this Kingdom, is the daily prayer of

Your most humble Servant, ALEX: RIGBY.
Preston in Lancashire, this 17 of Octo: 1643.
