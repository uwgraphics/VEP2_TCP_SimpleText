TO THE Kings Most Excellent MAJESTY CHARLES II.
By the Grace of GOD, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland; Defender
of the Faith, etc. And the Honorable Houses of PARLIAMENT.
May it please Your most Gracious Majesty,
OBserving, by traversing this Island, that diverse Rivers within the same may
be molded into such Form, as will admit of Vessels of thirty Tun burden, or
upwards, to sail in, unto the great Relief of diverse Countries in this Island,
by means of the same, at less then half the Rates now paid for Land carriage,
and near with as speedy return, going both by day and night; and to the Reward
of Your Most Gracious Majesty, if the same were once made so Navigable; and
considering at how easy a Charge (as I humbly conceive) the same may be brought
to pass, in comparison of the Advantages which may be reaped thereby: and the
great encouragement given my endeavors of bringing this design to pass, by
diverse Mayor Towns and Corporations of this Land, that conceive a Relish of the
Sweetness through the great Opinion only they have of it, upon serious
Discourse had with me concerning the same; a Catalogue whereof has been
presented to your Majesty: as by the like means may be had from many more such
Towns which have the like Invitations to the same: I humbly presume, upon this
stock, to become Importunate to Your most Excellent and Royal Majesty for the
enterprise of and ready effecting this Work, being an Undertaking so Heroic,
that it is beyond the Level of any others to attempt: and, seeing that the
longer it is delayed, If your Majesty shall understand that the same may
produce a Profit (which I endeavor by this small Treatise to evince) the
longer is the Profit lost. And after my Travels, Industry and Studies in and
about this great Improvement, and with so great an Expense of my Estate in Your
Majesty's Royal Fathers Service, by the Advance of a Troop of Horse, and the
accommodation of Three Sons, at my own proper Charge in the same, and
otherwise, besides the unhappy Consequence of Imprisonment, Plunder and
Sequestration in the same epidemical Misfortunes which all Your Loyal Subjects
accompanied Your Majesty in, and also a great Misfortune I sustained by Fire:
all which occasioned my Wife and self, during those times, to live at a great
distance from each other, and wholly to rely on our Friends, in so much that at
present, I am neither able to compose my debts, nor preserve my lawful Rights
against undue Encombrances: If Your Majesty shall be pleased to promote this
Work, and bring it to effect within my remnant of days, by Your Majesty's
gracious, favor, without other Expense then what will carry along with it an
advantage to Your Majesty; Your Majesty may relieve me with what may seem so
just, as a Recompense due unto me for my Endeavors about the same, and may
give me Leisure (after the distractions I now sustain) with great alacrity for
the discharge of so good an Office (as the Obteining of Your Majesty to effect
a work of so great a Benefit to my Country) to enjoy the fruits of my Labors,
and express my self

Your MAJESTY'S Most obsequious, faithful, and most obedient Subject and
Servant Francis Matthew.

The Opening of RIVERS FOR Navigation.
THough there be many more Obstructions and Difficulties to be met with, in the
making of the Riverrs within this Island Navigable, then are familiarly in the
Flat Netherlands of Holland, and the rest of the United Provinces of Belgium:
whose benefit may seem to allure us to the like Industry, nevertheless Englands
fair Valleys, and rich Inlets, through which many noble Rivers insinuate
themseves, might, with the Imitation of our ingenious Neighbors, be made in
many places docible of Navigation, to the inestimable comfort, ease and benefit
of the Subject: wherefore, in all Humility, I make this my most Humble Address
unto Your Most Renowned and Emperial Majesty: And show, That yet such an
Enterprise in several places of this Island may with advantage be effected by
diverse and sundry ways, of no less Importance to the whole Nation,

First, Of a Wonderful Improvement to much Trade, and great relief to the Land,
and most remarkably to be perceived, by the supply of many places with the
great Benefit of Coal (which without out this means cannot be had) to the
employment of Your Majesty's Subject in Mining, and otherwise about the same,
and also the advance of many from Low degree, becoming Merchants in the same,
(by that sure Trade of taking in their Commodities at easy rates; ready
returns, and certain gains, the Essentials of all Improvements therein) they
thereby becoming ranked in the highest Capacities to serve their King and
Country; and Excellent President whereof is to be seen in such of the
Merchants of Newcastle, who have traded in that Commodity alone; at much
greater hazard, delay and charge than in such Mediterranean Rivers (as is by
this designed) becoming Navigable, may be effectually brought to pass.
Secondly, To the great Ease of the Subject. for the Rivers so designed, being
Navigable thereby, with lesser Charge, with fewer hands, greater
Transportations from place to place and in shorter time may be made: Armies in
time of War, in their primest Strength, by such Transport, fit for ready
Service (which the hazardous Condition of a Soldiers Calling is daily to
expect) may safely, silently and without harrass of the Country in their goods
and Carriages, be thus conveyed. Thirdly, Hereby a great Increase of His
Majesty's Revenue may be established upon the Crown from such a Public Work,
which the happy experience His Majesty has had of the New Castle Trade of
Coal, were there no other Commodity then Coal to be transported in such Rivers,
may invite him to, and which may be settled with so great Cheerfulness of the
Subject, as that a great abatement of the Rates of the Commodities traffique'd
in may he had thereby; notwithstanding such imposition for His Majesty upon the
same, to the perpetual establishment of the Impost, as a just return to him for
so Public a good Work; to continue to him as one Diadem of his Crown for
ever. The Public proportionably enjoying the benefit thereof accordingly: By
which mutual returns unto each other, His Majsty and Subjects are naturally
interwoven in the Preservation of each other: According to the Maxim, That by
what the People, by the same the Government must grow: and vice versa: each of
them in their several ways and powers being to support each other. Fourthly,
This Island will hereby be the better fortified, because of the Increase of
Watermen, the Walls thereof. Fifthly. By countenancing this work, Horse will be
preserved: forwar, for Merchandise, or other purposes, as Occasion may offer,
and the Wisdom of Your Majesty may think best to approve of. Sixthly, And what
is well worthy of Observing, the Highways hereby will be much preserved, and
become a very acceptable work to the Country, which now notwithstanding their
great cost, is now a grievous Toil as well to man as beast, being now so
unnecessarily plowed up by Wagons of Prodigious Burdens, which in this Island
are daily traveling: And also to the insensible relief of this Island, by many
other ways and means to be discovered by us, as they shall be occasionally
offered to us to understand.
And, indeed, the making of these Rivers Navigable, may be brought to pass,
well nigh, at as easy a cost and charge as the Fenning works have been, though
such great Works seemingly threaten great difficulties, which may not be
foreseen or known till felt: Yet, re vera, the benefits are so innumerable and
considerable which invites unto this Work in many places of this Island, as, at
the very first sight, will show such hazards to be too inconsiderable to put a
Baffle, or occasion so Noble a Work, so feasible, and to so good purposes, and
high ends, (where they are well balanced, and managed by well pondered
resolutions) to be laid aside: there being in this Island, Sufficiency of all
sorts of Provisions for undertaking of the same, which Prince or People, either
are, or may be, unquestionably furnished with, being appointed of Council, in
all ways requisite for such an enterprise of the choicest stamp, and of hands
and means (in this so populous and great trading Nation) so inexpressibly
endless, as must indisputably admit them by a presupposed accord of both, to be
interpreted in an easy capacity, to act unto effect above the Level of such a
work as this: especially being English spirits (who by their high Transactions
almost of all kinds throughout the world) are deemed to admit nothing difficult
but by them with Ceremony to be brought to pass, so it be but fit in Prudence
to be undertaken, and the more the difficulty and greatness of the Work is
apparent, let it be carried on with the greater Cheerfulness, as to the more
achievement of our Honors in the Success thereof, after the manner of Atlas
who is decypher'd to have carried the World upon his Shoulders, without
groaning.

Over and besides the Variety of great and constant charges which are to be
expended in and about the effecting and continued fruition of this great
Improvement, there will be pre-required a Purchase of, or other agreement for
such Mills, and Parcels of Grounds, from the Inheritours of them or from such
as have the same by Lease, or from both; which intervenes in and upon such
Channels or Lands, which are so practicably capable amongst us (by the Industry
of man for good purpose) of being cut, opened, cleansed and otherwise fitted
for Navigation, and shall best accommodate such design: The Banks of such
Channels where there must be Occasion for Towing of the Vessels to be Navigated
with by the Assistance of Horse or man, being so necessary an appurtenant to be
made use of, together with such River to be made Navigable: (as well as the
frequent Occasions, which may be expected to be had of the same Banks, for the
Cleansing and other amendments of such Rivers) must obliege to agreements for
the same, wherein let the Seller departing from his right at another Will,
ever have advantage. All which sort of Purchases or Agreements (in every
several place where the same are to be made) and Sasses therein to be erected,
for the raising of the Water to a convenient depth for the Vessels to ride in,
by the particular skill and prudence of knowing Surveyors in such works, be
directed unto, after a strict Geometrical Survey of the several intervening
Platforms of grounds in and about every such several place where such work is
to be wrought, and Sasses to be planted, as the Nature of the place which
requires such purchase for such Improvement shall direct such Artist unto, ever
regarding (though the Circlings, windings of such Grafts for Rivers, made, or
to be amended for Vessels to sail in, shall thereby much enlarge the work in
measure.)

I. As well to avoid the Injuring of the Neighboring Countries by the
overflowing of the Banks, where such work is wrought, as to wave the
insupportable charge of fitting a passage through craggy Rocks for a shorter
cut, as a serviceable border, occasionally to be made use of for man or beast
to tow in -- And II. To make or appoint such graft (as designed for the safe
and firm erecting or planting of each such Sluice or Sass in, as shall by such
surveying Artist be judged requisite for such work) to be winding in the form
of a Bow. Such a River as is so, to be taught the Use of Navigation, for
diversion of the force of the Main stream, from off such Sass, in avoidance of
rending up or breaking of the same, which by the Natural force and current of
the Stream, especially in floods and Storms (if such Sasses should be planted
upon the most current Streams of the River, which they are to be inservient
unto) must reasonably be expected -- And no other means, ever was, or is
imaginable, for the fitting of a River of great Streams in many places, often
times too shallow for the draught of a Vessel of Convenient Burden, for good
Use upon such River, or for the apting of one River unto another, by cutting a
graft betwixt two Rivers, at such a Level as the Water of the one shall run into
the other, so as a Vessel may sail, or be towed from one of the Rivers unto the
other at arbitrament, except by such Sasses penning up, and thereby raising the
water for use as by so many stairs or steps as is or may be wanting to become
of convenient depth for the transport of Vessels of so good Burden, as may be
to good purpose, fit for the producing of a Comerce by Navigation between any
one Country of this Island and another.
Nor can the pulling up of Corn Mills (the only Obstruction, as being of a
more public service then any other intervening good) be a sufficient pretense
to impede this Enterprise of making such Rivers Navigable, as by consideration
of their Service to the Country, shall be found fit to made Navigable; seeing
that the Necessary Office of such Mills may be performed at an easyer charge by
Horse-mills, by Wind-mills, or by Mills termed River-Mills, which in the
Low-Countryes, and some parts of Italy are familiarly made use of in flat
bottomed Boats, and thereby conveyed to Service (as the Occasion of the
Country may require) from one place unto another, which by reason of the Number
and certainty of the Gryst of Corn at appointed times to be had, wrought by the
Water-mills now in use amongst us; the advantage of which, is little more then
a slight kind of Ceremony to man, an unfit Consideration to lay aside a real
Improvement, as is this, of making apt Rivers in the aptest places Navigable,
and the Right of Soaks belonging to the Inheritours of such Mills, as are so to
be removed, are preadmitted to be retaliated for with good advantage to the
Owner: but if this great Consumption of Timber be still permitted, there will
not be enough to build either Water-mill or Windmill.

Yet, if any Owner be of so morose a Spirit, as to bid a Contradiction to the
worlds and his own advantage, for his supposed unquestionable Vineyards sake,
Its reasonably to be understood a duty incumbent upon His Majesty and
Parliament, in such a case as Guardian to all Subjects goods and rights (as his
Catholic Majesty in his Dominions of Spain, takes charge of all the
Substance, and affairs of persons as are Lunatiques, governing their affairs
sine sine, modo and mensura) that His Majesty and Parliament may dispose of the
Estates of such persons ( will they nill they) as to the Public, shall seem
best, without the concurrence of them.

In every place where the making of a River Navigable is designed to be
enterprized, there is seriously to be considered what improvement may most
probably accrue to the Land or any part of the Land thereby, viz. what charge
may be saved, and what profit may by means thereof be had, which else could not
be had, and a conference of this must be had, with what must be expended for
effecting of such work, a computation sufficiently easy, unto abundant
satisfaction to be made, for where amongst other services, such Rivers shall
become subservient to some certain great Staple Trade, the Profit both to King
and Subject being certain to be always great (admitting the ordinary
Providence of Heavens influence in the preserving of such Trade) And the the
charge being but once, and that to be probably effected by one years profit,
accrewable by such River, or well near thereabouts, reasonably to be computed
by the necessary and great Trade of Coals, etc. unquestionably to be concluded
upon, to be had upon such River by the Countries great want of fuel bordering
upon the same, all other Trades to be had upon such Rivers bearing their proper
share, in the assistance of it, and considering further, that such works are
always to be wrought, where the grounds (which are to be so cut through) are
to be found, or admitted to be so favorable in their Site and nature to the
Work, as that of themselves they much lean to the doing of the same: whereby by
the charge must be esteemed moderate and such River already had or to be made
at, or well nigh, so moderate rates must, primo intuitu, be deemed properly
worthy to be so fitted for Navigation, all other constant immergent charges of
preserving the River, once made so Navigable being too Inconsiderable to
outweigh the Scales in this case.

By this Lesbian Rule, I have surveyed, examined, and found diverse Rivers
within this Island in apt places for such Trade practicable, with ease to be
made thus Navigable, and more particularly,

First, That the River Avon of Bristol, may be, by the prescribed means of Art,
charge and power upon the premised, prudent Balance of Charge and Profit, be
made Navigable from Bristol to Calne, or to Mamsbury in Wiltshire, and by
cutting a Graft of five Miles, or thereabout, in length only, through a ground
which I found favorable by Nature, for such purpose: the same River may take
its Journey for the same use, (planting Sasses also aptly upon the same) from
Mamesbury to Leshlade in Oxfordshire, and there salute the River Isis already
Navigable, which so delivers it self into the Thames, and bring the Trade of
Ireland, the Rich fruits of Cornwall, Devon and Sommerset, Mendip Hills, and
Wales, and any other Portage, as well as of the Intervening Countries, to the
Cittyes of Bristol and London, mentioned; and back again at will; by so much a
shorter and safer cut; (as will appear more plainly by diverse Maps, and other
printed Papers, set forth at my own particular charge) and so much lesser
charge of Portage then else can be (one boat upon the same carrying as much as
an hundred horse) as must exceedingly abate the price, by lessening the Charges
of the Commodities of the same: and more particularly bring an Immeasurable
Trade of Coals from Wales and Bristol, to the employing of many thousand
Subjects in Mines, and also about the River, and the great advance of many a
man by Merchandise, in and about the same; to the incredible Relief of the
bordering Countries of Wiltshire, Glocestershire, Oxfordshire, and others lying
on or near the same, as far as His Majesty shall from time to time think meet
in prudence to admit of; ever regarding the Preserve of His Newcastle Trade,
the great support of His Navy, which by the Supplies of the aforementioned
Countries from Bristol will not be endamaged: This proposed Trade of Coal, not
clashing with the Newcastle Trade at all; so much more may His Maj^sties
Coffers be enriched, then now they are, as well as by other Imposts; by an
Impost upon this Trade of Coals in the River Avon of Bristol becoming
Navigable, as is set forth, Insensible to those Countries, which are to be
supplied by the same, being they now pay thrice the rates for Coal to what the
same may be afforded at by the Merchant, notwithstanding his discharge of such
great Impost upon the same: and all other Commodities may be commerced in, upon
this River, at half the Charge of what is paid for Land carriage or Portage,
much to the Subjects ease and happiness, which also may afford a very
considerable Return to His Majesty for the same, to be squared out, when the
River shall become thus Navigable, as His Majesty and Parliament (by Balance of
the Gain of Portage in each particular Commodity to be thereby had above what
is now had) shall deem most just to both. And its worthy to be considered, how
great a relief of Coal, in times of War at Sea, the City of LONDON may enjoy
by this Achievement, Let the Cities incredible want of Coal, near to the
hazard of an Insurrection, in our late Conflicts with the Dutch, and the great
Ingredient, the Consideration of this want was of, to the Necessary contracting
of that Speedy Peace with them, convince us: Were my Advises of Sufficient
Interest to take place at the Helm, no earlier enterprise should be made, then
this of making Rivers Navigable within this Island, as is above set forth, in
Order to a secure Relief of this most famous City of LONDON, with all sorts of
Commodities, as, Timber, Stone, Lead, Iron, and all other Materials for
reedifying the same, (by a prudent Care) upon Occasion of such distress to be
had, or threatened, by War or otherwise. And its well worthy to be considered of
how great Relief this may be, by the Portage of an Army, as is above set forth.
Secondly, I find, that after the like manner to the like Traffic of
Commodities (when those tempestuous Seas, for want of convenient Harbors upon
the Borders of Lincolnshire, bids denial to all safe Trade there, to the like
great Employment of Miners, and other men, and great enrichment of many a
Merchant thereby: the like relief to His Majesty and Subjects, in the charge of
Portage, as Occasion shall require an abatement of rates through diverse
Countries thereby, and the like Return of Impost upon all Commodities, with the
like amicable respect, by an equal balance of what each Commodity will bear,
by consent of Parliament, to be settled upon His Majesty for the same; as the
River Avon of Bristol: may the River Waveney be made Navigable, by cutting of a
convenient graft near Loppam Bridge, sufficient for Navigation, less then three
Miles (through grounds, in their own Nature favorable for such an Enterprise)
into Little Ouse which carries it self unto Linn in Norfolk, and by Planting
Sasses upon those Rivers, as shall be advised by the prescribed directions: any
Commodities (as occasion shall require) may be hereby conveyed to the Use of
Suffolk, and Norfolk. These two Rivers so dividing those two Countries from
Yarmouth unto Linn, whence there is an open passage already had to Boston, with
such Rivolets shooting out in Arms to Cambridge, the Isle of Ely and other
places, provided by Nature to the convenient supply of those parts, so as any
thing may by that means be transported unto Boston, and thence up the River
Witham unto the City of Lincoln, whence by opening the passage (by neglect shut
up) betwixt that City and York Sea, upon Trent, heretofore made Navigable, as
Cambden reports, by our Henry the first, in a tender of his Subjects ease, in
his Progresses of State which he first begun) a like transport, to the
immediate great service of the Counties of Nottingham, Lincoln and Derby, may
any Commodities be transported there, and thence for York, and all the
Countries adjacent to those Mediterranean passages, as the Maps and Histories
of them, (showing all these Intervening Rivers, then by Nature free for
Navigation, unto York, and other neighboring parts) will best set forth, in
which perhaps a King has sailed. This way may be an interchange of all reliefs
which any of the neighboring Counties may supply each other with, betwixt York
and Yarmouth, and Armies may occasionally, with incredible advantage to
themselves and Country (as was said to be done by the same Prince) be conveyed
upon the same.
But the Country then being Strangers to the Trade of Coal, a Commodity, then
and for several Generations fully prevented by the ready supply of Wood for
fuel, and all other Traffic of these Countries being much short of what now
the same is; This New-cut River of seven miles betwixt Lincoln and Torksea,
for want of Use became sludg'd up and is grown into a Pasture, which the only
Trade of Coals (which it might be accommodated with) from Nottingham-shire,
Derby-shire or Yorkshire, were it now Navigable as then it was, as well to the
great relief of all the aforemen ioned Countries as the enrichment of Your
Majesty would now preserve; And let these observations made on these two
Rivers induce unto an Inquest, and Balance of other Rivers within this Island:
and bring those Parts into a flourishing Condition, all sorts of Commodities
from the Eastern parts of the World being equally distributed to the North and
East of England, (as by the former design of opening the Rivers between London
and Bristol, to the Western parts is exemplifi'd) in and from abroad
communicated to the West and South.

within the Isle of Ely, even up to Cambridg. Designs worthy to be brought
forth under the happy Government and Protection of Your Majesty.
