LONDON, Printed for R. H. in Queens-head Alley.

To the Kings most excellent Majesty.
A Petition presented to the Kings Majesty at York, the 1 of April, by the
Inhabitants of the County of Nottingham, and the County of the Town of
Nottingham, subscribed by 4540 hands of Knights, Esquiers, Gentlemen,
Freeholders, and the Major, Aldermen, and other Inhabitants of the Town of
Nottingham.
We your loyal and peaceful Subjects, Inhabitants of the County of
Nottingham, and the Town of Nottingham, do humbly crave leave to show, and
pray, as follows;
THat whereas after many straight Yoakes, and heavy burdens in the late long
intermission, or interruptions of Parliamentary Justice, by the predominance of
evil councels imposed on us, and with much patience borne by us (though to the
extreme pressure of our persons, consciences and estates) we were in the
midst of many troubles, dangers and extremities, to which this Kingdom was
thereby reduced: at last by Your Majesty's grace, in calling this Parliament,
relieved and eased, and by so happy a constitution of a Parliament, as this in
many blessed effects has appeared, together with the late mutual
correspondence of both Houses, we were revived with fresh and pregnant hopes,
that all our former evils, with the cause of them, should by this Parliament
(with Your Majesty's gracious Assent) be henceforth removed, and greater good
wrought and established to us, than we or our forefathers have seen: Yet now
by Your Majesty's late withdrawing both Your person and former grace to such a
distance from Your Parliament, we feell our hopes fainting, and almost extinct;
new fears raised of the old, and greater evils toward us; and foresee all
ordinary remedy like to be removed, or the timely application thereof to
extreme danger, retarded: Especially, by the advantage which the malignant
persons within us, and our enemies abroad (both in Ireland, and elsewhere) may
make of such Your distance from Your Parliament, and distrust of it, to the
promovall and accomplishment of their mischievous designs (by Your Parliament
faithfully represented) and the overwhelming of this Kingdom in the sad
effects of intestine discord.

We Your poor Subjects therefore, from deep and bleeding sense of miseries of
all sorts, thus growing on Your Self, on Yours, on us, on all, do humbly
presume to beg, That Your Majesty (weighing the the premises in your Princely
Thoughts) would be pleased to vindicate Your Kingdoms from approaching ruin,
Your self to security, and restore us to our now languishing hopes.

1 By rejection of evil counsels and Counselors, as have fomented Iealousies
or differences between Your Majesty and Parliament, and therein, or other ways,
obscure Your Native luster from Your people, making You appearelesse amiable
than (we believe) You are: and next, without which, we can expect no good.

2 By a timely return to some place near Your Parliament, where they may have
such a ready recourse as the exigencies of the times require, and Your Royal
Ancestors have ever vouchsafed their Parliaments; and also to Your good opinion
of them, and trust in them, as the best supporters of Your Wealth, Honor, and
Sovereignty.

And if Your Majesty shall be pleased to renew and continue this Your wonted
gracious regard to, and concurrence, with the best advice of Your Parliament,
for manage and settlement of Your Kingdoms affairs (which their fidelity may
deserve, and Your frequent promises have made Your people expect) the effects
will undoubtedly prove the glory of God, Your Majesty's truest honor, the
terror of Your enemies, safety of Your Kingdoms, and joy of Your good Subjects,
especially of us, who shall so clearly, according to to our Protestation, with
our Lives and Fortunes maintain and defend Your Ma-Majesties Royal Person,
Honor, and Crown; With the Power and Privileges of Parliament, The Rights and
Liberties of Your Subjects, And the Power and Purity of Protestant Religion.

And we shall ever pray, etc.
At the Court at York 31 Martii 1642.
THat this Petition (as some others of this nature) is grounded upon
misinformation; and being grieved and highly offended, to see how his good
people, have been and are abused by false rumors and intelligences (which have
procured causeless fears and apprehensions) refers the Petitioners to the two
answers He has given to His Parliament; viz. to the Declaration presented to
Him at Newmarket; And to the Petition presented to Him the 26 of this month at
York, wherein you will clearly perceive, That His Majesty is not gone* but
driven a way from His Parliament; and therefore His Majesty has reason to
think, that now understanding the love He bears to* and confidence he has of
His Peoples fidelity: As likewise His constant resolution for the maintaining
off, and governing by the Laws of the Land; you may find reason to Petition the
Parliament to comply with his majesty's just desires and gracious offers; This
being the only way safely and speedily, to cure the present distractions of
this Kingdom and (with Gods blessing) to put a happy end to the Irish
rebellion; for the effecting whereof (as His Majesty has often said) He will
neither spare pains nor decline any hazard of His person or fortune.

Oliver Nicholas.

The Letter.
Loving Brother,
I Was this last week at York, with twenty Gentlemen more, and diverse others,
to deliver a Petition to his Majesty, which was done on Thursday last being the
last of March: and Lincolneshire delivered one on Monday before; Yorkshire
delivers one about Tuesday next; and Darbyshire about Wednesday, or Thursday
next, all which are much tending to one effect, that is, humbly to entreat his
Majesty to abide near, and hearken to His Parliament, and to remove evil
Counselors from about him, with some other things. I have Copies of them all,
but they are too long for me to copy out at this time, ours I am confident
John Drewrey showed you the last week, if not Master Fankingham can show it
you, and you may show him this Answer given to us, under the Secretaries hand
with His Majesty's direction, and it is the very same Lincolne-shire Gentlemen
received from His Majesty, to their Petition. Yorke-shire is said, will appear
14 thousand in person to avow theirs, the Sherriffe is a chief man in it:
Darby is said to be 300. at least, the Sherriffe, Baronets, Knights, Esquires,
Gentlemen and others. Lincolneshire, Sir Richard Earl, delivered it with some
twenty Gentlemen of quality, who were scoffed at by the Courties and Citizens,
and called Roundheads, they lay in York on Sunday being Corronation day,
where was bonefiers made, and much disorder; and about midnight that night,
about threescore persons with clubs and bills assalted the house where they lay,
and swore they would have the bloods of them, the Gentlemen being up, and the
Rogues got into the house they were forced to put out their lights, and betake
themselves to their Swords, which done the unknown Rascals departed, giving
threatening speeches, that they would cut the throats of them that came next*
yet I praise God we had reasonable fair quarter with them: the City of York
we perceive offars these abuses to Petitioners on purpose to deter them for
coming to the King, because they would have reside with them; those that are
well affected (which are but few in comparison of the multitude) do join with
us willingly and freely, both in judgment and matter; the Court is very thin
as yet, but increases daily; the latter Declaration mentioned in our Answer,
is not yet in print; the Kings first Answer was (He refers us to the Kentish
Petition) but we prssing for a further and more satisfactory Answer, had as you
may here see, with hopes still of a better. The Kentish Petition was ordered to
be Printed, but speeding so badly at London, it is stopped as yet; much more I
could tell you, but my occasions will not permit me, therefore with our best
affections to you all, I commit you to the Lords protection and rest,

Your ever loving brother while Joseph Widmerpole.

Report this from me to be a true Copy of our Answer there.

His Majesty's Message, sent to the Parliament the eighth of April. 1642.
Concerning His Resolution to go into Ireland for suppressing the Rebels there.
HIs Majesty being grieved at the very soul, for the Calamities of His good
Subjects of Ireland, and being most tenderly sensible of the false and
scandalous Reports dispersed amongst the People, concerning the Rebellion
there, which not only wounds His Majesty in Honor, but likewise greatly
Retards the reducing of that unhappy Kingdom, and multiplies the Distractions
at hom^, by weakening the mutual confidence betwixt Him and His People: Out of
His pious Zeal to the Honor of Almighty God, in establishing the true
Protestant Profession in that Kingdom, and His Princely care for the good of
all his Dominions, has firmly resolved with all convenient speed to go into
Ireland, to chastise those wicked and detestable Rebels (odious to God and all
good men) thereby so to settle the Peace of that Kingdom, and the security of
this, that the very name of Fears and Ielousies may be no more heard of
amongst Us.

As His Majesty doubts not, but that his Parliament will cheerfully give all
possible assistance to this good Work; so he requires them and all his loving
Subjects to believe, that he shall upon those considerations as earnestly
pursue this Design (not declining any hazard of His person, in performing that
Duty which he owes to the defense of Gods true Religion, and His distress^d
Subjects) as for these, and only these ends He undertakes it: to the sincerity
of which profession He calls God to witness, with this further assurance, that
His Majesty will never consent (upon whatsoever pretense) to a toleration of
the Popish profession there, or the abolition of the Laws now in force against
popish Recusants in that Kingdom,

His Majesty has further thought fit, to advertise his Parliament, that
toward this Work He intends to raise forthwith by his Commissions, in the
Counties near Westchester, a Guard for His own person (when he shall come into
Ireland) consisting of two thousand foot, and two hundred Horse, which shall be
Armed at Westchester from His Magazine at Hull: At which time all the Officers
and Soldiers shall take the Oaths of Supremacy, and Allegiance: The charge of
raising and paying whereof His Majesty desires His Parliament to add to their
former Undertakings for that War, which His Majesty will not only well accept;
But if their pay be found too great a burden to His good Subjects, His Majesty
will be willing (by the advice of His Parliament) to sell, or pawn any of His
Parks, Lands, or Houses toward the supplies of the Service of Ireland: With
the Addition of these Levies to the former of English and Scots agreed upon in
Parliament, He hopes so to appear in this Action, that (by the assistance of
Almighty God) in a short time that Kingdom may be wholly reduced and restored
to peace, and some measure of happiness whereby He may cheerfully return, to
be welcomed home with the Affections and blessings of all His good English
people.

Toward this good work, as His Majesty has lately made dispatches into
Scotland, to quicken the Levies there for Vlster; So He heartily wishes that
his Parliament here would give all possible expedition to those which they have
resolved for Munster and Conaught: and hopes the encouragement which the
adventurers (of whose interest his Majesty will be always very careful) will
hereby receive (as likewise by the lately signing of a Commission for the
Affairs of Ireland, to such persons as were recommended to him by both houses
of Parliament) will raise full sums of money for the doing thereof.

His Majesty has been likewise pleased (out of His earnest desire to remove
all occasions, which do unhappily multiply mis-undeestandings between Him and
His Parliament) to prepare a Bill to be offered to them by His Attourny,
concerning the Militia, whereby He hopes the Peace and safety of this Kingdom
may be fully secured, to the general satisfaction of all men, without
violation of His Majesty's just Rights, or prejudice to the Liberty of the
Subject. If this shall be thankfully received; He is glad of it. If refused; He
calls God* and all the world to judge, on whose part the default is. One thing
His Majesty requires, (if this Bill be approved of) That if any Corporation
shall make their lawful rights appear, they may be reserved to them.

Before His Majesty shall part from England, He will take all due care to
entrust such persons with such Authority in His absence, as He shall find to be
requisite for the peace and safety of this Kingdom, and the happy Progress of
this Parliament.

FINIS.
