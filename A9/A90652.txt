Englands sorrow for the loss of their late General: OR, An Epitaph upon his
Excellency ROBERT Earl of Essex, etc. Who died September 15. 1646. with a
perfect Memorial of the particular Services and Battles that he himself was
engaged in Person.
BRing Reader, to this sacred Hearse,
A tear Cemented with a Verse.
First let thy melting fancy be
Thawed to some pious Elegy;
Then to these Relics let thy eyes
Disburse their watrie subsidies,
Which by that Cold our sighs dispense,
Shall into Crystal straight condense,
Which being thus enchas'd, shall shine
Like Pearl congealed upon this Shrine,
But when they find what flame does burn,
Shut up ith Casket of this Urne,
How Palm with Olive interweaves,
And in this Tomb both twist their Leaves,
And that within this Marble Cell
The Ashes of great Essex dwell,
Who under-rating his high blood,
Sought only to be great and good,
And first himself, Exacted then
By just commands too, other men,
That us to virtue he might draw,
More by Example then by Law; --
They Will to resent this loss, I fear,
Resolve into one General tear,
Which being distild into his Tomb,
Shall Balsome unto his dust become;
So shall thy tears this Charter have,
To lie as Leigers in his Grave,
And to these honored Ashes be
A perpetual Obsequie.
Thomas Philipot.

Ferreres of Chartley Boucher and Louains Lord General of all the Parlaments

A List of the several Victories in which his Excellency was engaged in person.
HIs Excellency being made Captain General by the Parliament over all the
Forces in England, as was Voted by both Houses the 12 day of July 1642.
protesting to live and dye with him. And by the first of August following, his
Excellency had raised 10000. men, which he caused to be committed to Officers,
and drawn into Regiments, and so marched immediately into the field.

The 23. of October next after was a very great battle fought between Keynton
and Edgehill by his Excellency and his Army; and that of the Kings led by his
Majesty: At which time his Excellencies Army killed the Kings General, the
Earl of Lindsey, the Lord Auboney, Sir Edmond Varney, and diverse more; and
took prisoners the Lord Willowby, three Colonels, and many hundred more, and
brought away 16 of the Kings Ensigns.

His Excellency was in this battle engaged against a great Army, where was the
King in person, and Princes, Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, Barons,
Knights, and Gentlemen of all orders, who engaged themselves against him; yet
his Excellencies Army fought most cheerfully by the example of their General,
whose undaunted courage put life into every man.

Afterward the Kings Forces being come up to Branford and Henley in November,
his Excellency after several engagements with them, and assistance coming to
him from the City of London, who protested to live and dye with him; he forced
the Kings Army to retreat to Oxford with the loss of above two hundred men.

In April, Anno 1643. his Excellency being recruted, marched again into the
field with his Army, and took the Town and Garrison of Redding from his
Majesty, and after several defeats given to parties of the Kings Army he took
the Town of Cirencester.

After which his Majesty's whole Army being again drawn into the field, his
Excellency marched up to them, the Queen came up to the Kings Army, and a
great party with her to strengthen his Majesty's Army against the Earl of
Essex; But his Excellency fought with them near Nubery, where he killed five
Lords, and diverse others of quality, the King with the loss of 500 men
retreated to Edgehill, whither the Queen came to him.

In May, 1644. his Excellency desired the Parliament to have a Committee to
reside with him in the Army, and his Excellency made preparations to the
field, and presently besieged Oxford where the King then was, and at the
beginning of June got away toward the West, the King and the Prince being gone
to Exeter with the Lord Paulet, and others; his Excellency having taken diverse
prisoners, drew his Army after them; the Queen fled over into France; his
Exellencie took in the West diverse persons in several places, amongst which
many of quality, and diverse Garrisons: In June his Excellency secured
Weymouth, Taunton Deane, Wareham Bavonestable, Mount Stanford near Plymouth,
Plimton, Saltash, and Lanceston. And in July his Excellency gave a defeat to
Greenvill near Lestithiell in Cornwell, and took 100. prisoners, and killed
300. upon the place, and then took Tadcaster, and Foy; and did beat them from
Newbridge, still taking more prisoners daily.

In August his Excellency fell upon the Cornish Brigade near Saltash, and
brake through their Army, slew many of them upon the place, took 300.
prisoners and four Drakes.

Then the Kings whole Army, Maurices and Greenvils were drawn into the field in
Battalia, in number almost 20000 men, near Lestithiell, where his Excellency
daily skirmished with them, killed many, took prisoner Colonel Champernoone,
who was sore wounded, and diverse more, many lying six and eight in an heap,
and upon desire his Excellency granted them leave (at a parley) to bury their
dead.

On Saturday the 24. of August 1644. his Excellency appointed Major General
Whitcot, and Colonel Ware to guard the rear of Lestithiell, and make a damme
to stop provisions from the Kings Army that way; and his Excellency with a
small party of Colonel Gowres Regiment beat off 3000. horse and foot from Blazy
Bridge, appointed by the enemy to stop provisions from Millibilly-Bay, where
his Excellency* killed many, and took prisoners a Colonel, two Captains, and
diverse others.

In the beginning of September, his Excellency notwithstanding that he was so
over-powred by the enemy, yet preserved both himself and his men, forced the
enemy from the Seacoasts, and got safe to the Lord Admiral; his horse not
above 3000. brake thorough the whole body of the Kings Army; and his foot not
above 6000. though encompassed with 20000. of the Kings, from Gromporond,
Enedor, and Foy, even to Blazy Bridge, who were resolved to give no quarter to
our men; yet they fought it out so gallantly, killing two of theirs for every
man that were lost, until at last they got Articles from the Kings party to
have a safe convoy to Lestithiell, Poole, and Wareham, their sick men to
remain at Foy; and none of them be pressed to desert their service to his
Excellency.

And his Excellency being recruited in September from the Parliament, and in
October had his Randezvous at Titchfeild, and falling on the Kings rear, took
almost one hundred prisoners near Kingscleare; and with the assistance of the
Earl of Manchester and Sir William Waller, routed the Kings Army near Newbury,
and took nine pieces of Ordnance, 300. prisoners, and 500. Arms.
