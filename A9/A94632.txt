To the Right-Honourable the Lord Mayor, the Aldermen, and Common Council, in
Common Council assembled.
My Lord, Knights, and Gentlemen,
THe deep sense of our particular miseries, together with a tender fellow
feeling of the sad and distempered condition of this famous City, and also of
the whole Kingdom, has upon diverse serious and mutual debates so far
prevailed with us, a great and considerable part of this County of Essex, as
humbly to make our addresses in a petitionary way to the honorable Houses of
Parliament the fourth of this instant May; The sum of our desire is briefly
thus, That the King our gracious Sovereign may come with honor and safety, to
treat with his two Houses of Parliament, the only probable way now left us,
whereby the true Protestant Religion, and all the just rights and liberties of
the King, Parliament, and Subjects, and the ancient and known Laws of this
Realm and government, may by the blessing of God upon their joint consents in
Parliament, be once more revived and reestablished, to the glory of God, and
comfort of all honest men; and though we cannot doubt of an unanimous
compliance from the greatest part of this City, and of the whole Kingdom in
this our last refuge, yet for the better satisfaction, and to clear our selves
from the mis-interpretation of such as are of a contrary opinion, we do
ingeniously declare. First, that our address shall be with all civility and
respect both to the Parliament and City, free from any intent of disturbing the
peace and quiet of either; but on the contrary, with an hearty desire to
prevent the effusion of so much blood as will probably be shed, if not by a
personal Treaty timely prevented, which all men may discern that look not
through Spectacles of particular interests. Secondly, we do not carelessly pass
by any Ordinance of Parliament* published unto the Kingdom, but do well
remember, and have very seariously considered of that particular Vote against a
personal Treaty, and the reason upon which it is grounded; And we have further
compared it with three former Declarations, where in the first we were told,
That the separation of his Royal Person from his Parliament was the original
of our unhappiness; In the second, when we assisted in so large a proportion
both of men and money, That the chief intent of raising the Army was, To bring
the King from his evil Counsel in honor and safety to his Parliament; in the
third, when we groaned under the burden, That it was impossible ever to have a
safe well grounded peace without his Majesty's personal concurrence in
Parliament: When we looked upon the weighty reasons expressed in the said
Declarations, we are well assured, that whosoever well considers what it has
cost to procure a personal Treaty, cannot justly blame any man for desiring of
it; And upon these considerations we are encouraged to proceed ^ith confidence
that the Honorable Houses will grant our requests, which we conceive
reasonable, whereas to our understanding no apparent prejudice can ensue
thereby. Thus humbly desiring the blessing of Almighty God to assist us in
these our just desires, we commit you to his protection.

Your Honors most humble servant.
Stratford Lancton.
