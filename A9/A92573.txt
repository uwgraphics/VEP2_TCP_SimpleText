A LETTER From the Meeting of the Estates of the Kingdom of Scotland, to the
King of England, In Answer to His Majesty's Letter, Direct to them.
May it please Your Majesty,
AS Religion, Liberty and Law are the dearest Concerns of mankind, so the deep
sense of the extreme Hazards these were exposed to, must produce suitable
Returns from the Kingdom of Scotland to Your Majesty, whom in all Sincerity and
Gratitude, we acknowledge to be under God, our great and seasonable Deliverer;
and we heartily Congratulat, that as God has honored Your Majesty to be an
eminent Instrument for the preservation of His Truth, so he has Rewarded Your
Undertakings with Success, in the considerable Progress which You have made in
Delivering us, and in preserving to us the Protestant Religion.

We return our most dutiful Thanks to Your Majesty, for Your accepting the
Administration of public Affairs, and Conveening the Estates of this Kingdom;
and we shall with all convenient Diligence, take Your gracious Letter into our
ConsIderation, hoping shortly, by the blessing of God, to fall upon such
Resolutions, as may be acceptable to Your Majesty, secure the Protestant
Religion, and Establish the Government, Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom upon
solid Foundations, most agreeable to the general Good and Inclination of the
People.

As to the Proposal of the Union, we doubt not Your Majesty will so Dispose
that Matter, that there may be an equal readiness in the Kingdom of England to
accomplish it, as one of the best means for securing the Happiness of these
Nations, and setting a lasting Peace.

We have hitherto, and still shall endeavor to avoid Animosities or
Prejudice, which might disturb our Councils, that as we design the public
Good, so it may be done with the general Concurrence and Approbation of the
Nation: In the mean time, we desire the continuance of Your Majesty's Care and
Protection toward us in all our Concerns, whereof the kind Expressions in Your
gracious Letter, have given us full assurance,

Signed in Name of us the Estates of this Kingdom of Scotland, by our
President, May it please Your Majesty, Your Majesty's most Humble, most
Faithful and Obedient Servant, HAMILTON P.
