Romes Monster on his monstrous Beast!
To fullness of his foulness (now) encreast!
How He in Papal Pride does ride along,
And how his sons and shauelings thrust and throng
To see his sacred hollow-Holinesse
His Babylonish Blasphemies express.



Wherein Romes Rabble rankly rise and grow.

With ill-got-Gaine, his steps on stylts do guide;
To raise him up aloft, in supreme Seat,
Like Saturnes Son, ruling all Princes great.

The very stars (Gods Saints) does sore assail:
Whereby is shown, Romes bloody Inquisition,
Wasting Gods Saints, hasting their own perdition,
Babels Bishops, Jesuits, Friars bace,
About the Beasts Posteriours flock apace,

Of Romes all-rotten Relics, dear Decrees,

Romes domination,

And in Destruction sleeping, snorting die.
As (thus) proud Babels Baud does prowdly prance,
In Blood and Blasphemy Her-selfe t'aduance

Poures-downe the Vials of dire Desolation
Upon Romes Whore, and with his nosthrils breath,


Who shoots his shaft and reaues and cleaues his heart.
Whom (as She in her hight of Pride did sit)

Of Desolation and Destruction dire,

Thus is proud Babel fallen, and in her fall,
Fallen are her Vassals, Satan's Vessels all:
Even now, this work begins, for, Rome looks sickly,
Even so Lord Jesus come, oh Lord come quickly;
To right the wrongs of thy distressed Saints.
To send an end to all their woes and plaints.
Most humbly, heartily prays, JOHN VICARS.
