TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY.
YOur Majesty's Loyal, and peaceable Subjects, the Barronets, Knights,
Esquires. Freeholders, and other Inhabitants of the County and Town of Derby.
Humbly crave leave, to show and pray, as follows.
Whereas, we are distracted with the general Fears of the Kingdom; that your
Majesty's Removal from Your Parliament, will be a dissolution of your Gracious
Intents, and Pious Endeavors; for the Reformation of this your Grievances,
which had crept both within the Church and Commonwealth. And likewise an
Obstruction to the Relief of these Pressures, under which we groan; And an
absolute hinderance of the Calamities, Distresses of Your Majesty's Subjects of
Ireland.

WIth bleeding hearts, We humbly beseech Your Majesty; That you will be pleased
to return unto, and reside near the Parliament, your supreme Court and
Counsel; Whereby we conceive your Royal Crown established upon your Self and
Posterity; Our Religion, Lives, and Liberties secured unto Us, and Ours. And is
the only Means to expediate Relief to your Majesty's said Protestant Subjects
in Ireland: without which, we can conceive no Possibility of safety to your
sacred Majesty to then, or us; Who shall most readily, according to Our
Protestation, with our Lives and fortunes, maintain, and defend your Majesty's
Royal Person, Honor, and Crown, the Power and Privileges of Parliament, the
Rights and Liberties of the Subject; And the Power and Purity of the Protestant
Religion.

And We shall ever pray, etc.
LONDON. Printed for Andrew Coe. 1642.
