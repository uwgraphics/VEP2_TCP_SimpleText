The Royal Virgin. OR THE DECLARATION OF SEVERAL MAIDENS In and about the
once Honorable City of LONDON,
FOR AS MUCH as, (since that most horrible, unnatural, unrighteous, unjust, and
most heinous murder, committed upon the person of Our most Renowned,
Honorable, Inocent, Harmless, Good dispositioned KING CHARLES ^^e first; And
since the banishing, disowning, disinheriting and dispossessing of Our three
most Illustrious, Virtuous, and inefable Princes) We say, for as much as (since
these abominable, unsufferable Acts) ENGLAND, SCOTLAND and IRELAND, have had
Experience of several Subtle, Covetious, Ambitious, self-seeking Guardians, and
Governors ^ver Them. Who (instead of saving their LIBERTIES, preserving their
TRADE, and upholding the ^ood of these NATIONS) have cheated the People,
stinted their Ttade, spilt mnch Inocent Blood, and have done notbing viewable,
but evil in these Nations.) We do Declare,

FIRST, PARLIAMENT, a full PARLIAMENT, or a Piece of a PARLIAMENT, (We leave
that to the discretion of him) who only has Power to Call a PARLIAMENT) We do
therefore Declare, That the only means, (in Our Judgments) to bring these
NATIONS to out of Bondage; For the preserving of Peace, and the upholding of
every good thing, will be, the speedy Restoration of the Banished, We mean,
that the Government be of these Nations be cast upon the Shoulders of him that
ought to bear it; that the People of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND and IRELAND, may be
obedient to Him, to whom Obedience is due, and that the Crown may be set upon
His head whose Right it is. C. R.

SECONDLY, Rump) We do utterly disown it, accounting it abundantly below our
Sphere, to stoop to that Tail, whence the Head is forced to absent it Self.

THIRDLY, and LASTLY, Lambert did hss Wives, you may repent at your leisure as
he dos and after all, do as Alderman Hoyle did, Hang your selves for madness.

Behold O Men, we aim at Preservation,
Unless you stand unto Our Declaration
Your Aonour is condemned, and you Behold
Are quite undone, Your Fortunes are foretold.
Signed by many thousands of Maidens in the Cities of London and Westminster,
and the Borough of Southwark, and other adjacent parts: which to nominate here,
would be to tedious.

Printed for Virgin Hope-well, and are to be sold at the Maiden-Starre. 1660.
