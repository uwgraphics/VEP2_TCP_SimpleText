THE KERNEL OF Christianity.
Q WHat is every own bound to know that looks to be saved?

A. Two things.

1. Something concerning God. 2 Something concerning Man.
Q What ought you to know and believe concerning God?

A. That there is own most glorious God. Deuteronomy. 6.4. Exodus 33.18.

Q How does it appear that God is so glorious?

A. In four particulars.

1. In his Effence, which is incomprehensible. 2. In his attributes, which are
those divine perfections whereby he makes himself known to us, which
attributes are not qualities in God, but nature. Gods Justice is God himself,
and Gods power is God himself etc. 3. In his persons, which are three. 1. The
Father begetting. 2. The Son begotten. 3. The Holy Ghost proceeding. 1 The
Father is glorious in regard of Election. 2. The Son is glorious in regard of
Redemption. 3. The Holy Ghost is glorious in regard of Application. 1. The
Father is glorious in choosing the house. that is in the heart of a poor
sinner. 2. The Son is glorious in purchasing the house. that is in the heart
of a poor sinner. 3. The Hoy Ghost is glorious in dwelling in the house. that
is in the heart of a poor sinner.
4. In his works.
Q What are those?

A. 1. His decrees of Election. Reprobation
2. His works of Creation. Providence.



Q What ought you to know and believe concerning his work of creation?

A. That this one glorious God made all things of nothing in six days in
excellent order and very good. Heb. 11.3. Exodus 20.11. Gen 1.^1.

Q What ought you to know and believe concerning the work of providence?

A. That this one glorious God vvisely orders, governs, and disposes of
all things, even to the least circumstance, Mat. 6.26. etc. and 10, 29, 30.

Q. What ought you to know and believe concerning man?

A. These six things follovving: 1. What was the glorious, and happy condition
of man by creation. 2. What that miserable, and lamentable estate is, that man
is now fallen into. 3. What Jesus Christ is, the only means of deliverance
out of this estate. 4. What faith is, the only means of applying Christ, and
how it is wrought in the soul. 5. What that happy estate is, that every man
that is in Christ by Faith, is brought unto. 6. What kind of thankfulness, and
life it is, that God requires of all them that be in this estate by Christ.


Q. What are you to know concerning the glorious condition of man by Creation?

A. God created all mankind in his own Image.

Q Wherein did the Image of God consist?

A. In perfect knowledge, righteousness, and holiness. Col. 3.10. Ephesians 4 24.

Q. Man being created in a most happy condition, wherein did his happiness
consist?

A In two things especially: 1. His understanding was full of divine
knowledge of the whole mind of God. 2. His will and affections were fully
conformable to Gods will.


Q Wherein did man's happiness further consist?

A. In five things: 1. He was in favor with God. 2. He had familiar
communion with God. 3. He felt unspeakable joy arising from this communion. 4.
He had dominion over all inferior creatures. 5. He was immortal, and should
never have tasted of death, if he had not fallen by sin.


Q. Does this any way concern us?

A. Yes; his estate was ours in him; we being then in his loins.

Q. What learn you by this?

A. Three things:

1. To lament and bewail the loss of this condition by sin.

2. That I ought to labor to get this jmage of God repaired in me.

3. That I ought not to be ashamed of holiness, nor to content my self with
some small measures of it, much less to hate it, as profane persons and
dissembling hypocrites do.

Q. What is that miserable and lamentable estate that man is now fallen into?

A. His misery now appears in four things.

1. In his birth: he is borne dead in sin and so void of all good, and full
of all evil, and so a child of wrath. Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3, 4. Romans 1.29.

2. In his life, whatsoever he does is sin in Gods sight. Tit. 1.15. God and
all creatures are his enemies. Psalm. 5.5. Job. 5.23. he remains a bondslave of
Satan til God convert him. Acts. 26.18. and hangs by the tvvinethred of life
every moment ready to drop into hell.

3. In his death: then comes an end of all his hopes, and pleasures, and the
beginning of all his vvoes and sorrovves.

4. After death: First comes his particular judgment. Heb. 9.27. after this
follows his general judgment, when that terrible sentence, 25. and the 41.
ver. shall be pressed upon him. After this follows the execution, wherein
the vialls of Gods fierce wrath are povvred out upon his soul and body,
which fire shall never be quenched.

Q. Wherein does the aggravation of this woeful estate of man by nature appear?

A. In three particulars: 1. He knovves not his misery. Rev. 3.17 2. He is not
affected with it, though he should know it. Romans 2.5. 3. He is unable of
himself to come out of it, though he should both know it and be affected
with it. Romans 5.6.


Q. What learn you from hence?

A. I learn that Gods wrath against sin, and sinful man (temaining in
this condion) is very great.

Q. How great is it?

A. So great that nothing (without Christ) but eternal death of body and
soul in the everlasting torments of hell can satisfy Gods just displeasure.
Gal. 3.10.

Q. Is it best now to see your miserable condition by nature, and to seele this
wrath of God, and mourn under it while there is hope, and means to come out
of it; or to stay till the gate of grace be shut; and God snatches the soul
from all hope, and means by death?

A. It Is far better to see it, and to mourn under it now.

Q. How, and why must a man see and feel himself under this wrath and misery?

A. 1. Every man must see that he is under Gods wrath for the present; else he
will never seek to Christ to bear it for him.

2. Man must see what this fearful wrath of God is, that is now piled
against him; else he will never prize Christ to deliver him out of it.

3. All men must see that this wrath is ready to light on them every moment in
the full measure of it; else they will defer their return till hereafter.

4 A man must see he is bound hand and foot in the chains of his sins, and
cannot come from under them, nor lay hold of Christ to help him out of them;
else he will presume he has received Christ when he has not.

Q. What is to be known of every one concerning Jesus Christ, the only means
of deliverance out of this estate?

A. These four things:

1. What his person is, namely, both God and man united into one person, which
is Jesus Christ.

2. What his love is toward man, namely past understanding. Ephesians 3.18, 19.

3. What his offices are, which are these three.

1. His Priestly office, whereby he offered himself for his Church Heb. 7.27.

2. His Prophetical office, whereby he teaches his Church. Acts 3.22.

3. His Kingly office, whereby he rules his Church. Psalm. 2.6.

4. How he delivers those, whom he purposes to save, hamely by being made
sin, and curse and righteousness for them. 2. Cor. 5.21. Gal. 3.13. 1. Cor.
1.30.

Q. What learn you from hence?

A. I learn that all my sinful duties, no nor my death, cannot pacify Gods
wrath, and deliver me from it: It is done only by the perfect righteousness
and death of Jesus Christ.

Q. How may we come to get this Christ to do all for us?

A. By receiving him by Faith. Ioh. 1.12.

Q. When may a man without presumption receive Christ as his own? Mat. 11.28,
29


A. 1 When the poor soul is so weary, and heavy laden with the apprehension
of sin, and wrath that it cannot live without Christ.

2. When the poor sinner is so out of love with himself, that he is content
to part with all sin for Christ. Isa. 55.7.

3. When the poor sinner receives Christ to that end that God the Father
offers him, namely to be his Priest, Prophet, and King.

Q How may a man come to receive Christ? can man create Faith in himself to
receive him, or must the Lord by an infinite almighty power work it in him?

A. The Lord must create faith in him by his almighty power. Ephesians. 1.19.

Q. What is to be known concerning faith, the only means of applying Christ?

A. Two things 1. what Faith is. 2. How it is wrought in the soul.


Q. What is Faith?

A. It is a special grace of God, whereby an humbled sinner feeling himself
unable to believe, Mat. 11.28.
is drawn, and so comes by the help of Gods Spirit to Christ for all good,
and so rests upon him. Job. 6.44, 45. Phil. 3.7, 8, 9.

Q. How does the Lord work this Faith in the soul by his mighty power, and
how comes the soul to know it is wrought?

A. By these nine steps:

1. The Lord gives the soul a listening ear to the word preached, as if God
himself were speaking to it.

2. The Lord makes the soul to understand the word. Mat. 13.23.

3. The Lord savingly vvounds the soul, with the sense and apprehension of
his lost estate; having understood it. Acts. 2.37.

4. Act 5.6.9.
Then the Lord makes the soul poor in spirit, ready to dye for want of
grace, and Christ. Mat. 5.3.

5. John. 3.16.
The Lord reveals unto the soul the freeness of his grace and mercy in
Christ, and then brings the soul to ponder on this mercy, from whence arises
hope of help; hereupon hope comes and waits one Christ for it, seeing now it
is possible that an unvvorthy sinful, lost creature may have it. Joel. 2.14.
Jonah 3.9.

6. Ephesians. 2.7.
The Lord reveals the riches of his mercy in Christ, whereby the soul hungers
after it. Mat. 5.6. and is not quiet without it, hence he desires, and longs,
and beggs for it, with unutterable groans, seeing and knovving (with the
prodigal) that there is enough in his fathers house. Luke. 15.
Romans 8.26.

7. Then the Lord reveals the vvorth and excellency of his mercy in Christ,
Ephesians. 3.7
and hereby makes the soul to love it. Hence love to this mercy comes
secretly, and contents it self with it; hereupon the soul promises if it
may but have this mercy in the Lord Jesus to pity it, and receive it; it will
everlastingly own it, and admire the Lord for it. Lam. 3.24.

8. Psalm. 63.3.
The Lord reveals the sweetness of his mercy in the Lord Jesus, and hereby
gives the soul a satisfying taste of it, and hence the will comes and is
persuaded with joy to leave it self for ever upon it, here to live, or here
to dye. Psalm. 39.7.

9. The soul being thus come up to Christ; the Lord does at last reveal the
property of mercy to him, (thus believing) whereby the soul is now assured,
and persuaded that neither height, nor depth shall separate him from Gods love
in Christ. Romans 8.38, 39.

Q. What is that happy condition that every one does enjoy, who are thus in
Christ by Faith*

A. It consist in two things: 1. Union with Christ. 2. The benefits which the
soul does enjoy hereby.


Q. What is Union with Christ?

A. It is that whereby the Spirit makes the soul one with Christ, and Christ
all to it. 1. Cor. 6.17. Col. 3.11.

Q. What benefits does the soul immediately enjoy by Union with Christ?

A. These four 1. Justification. 2. Reconciliation. 3. Adoption. 4.
Regeneration.


Q. What is Justification?

A. It is a gracious act of God the Father, whereby he imputing the finnes of
a believer to Christ, and Christ's righteousness to him, he accounts him
guiltless, and just before him. Romans 3.26.4.3.5.5.1. 2 Cor. 5.21. Ephesians. 1.7.
Col. 1.14. Psalm. 32.1, 2.

Q. What is reconciliation?

A. It is a most gracious act of God the Father offended, whereby he receives
into his favor a justified sinner. 2 Cor. 5.18, 19. Col. 1.21.

Q. What is Adoption?

A. A gracious act of God the Father, whereby he accounts a reconciled sinner
his son, and so makes him coheire with Christ. Gal. 4.5, 6.

Q. What is Regeneration?

A. It is a gracious act of God in the heart of his sons, whereby in uniting
them unto Christ, he infuseth a most glorious life into them. Ephesians. 2.10. and
4.24.

Q. What follows a believers Union with Christ?

A. Two things. 1. Coalition, or growing up with Christ 2. Glorification.


Q By what means or wherein does a believing soul grow up with Christ?

A. By increase of Faith and sanctification

Q Wherein does sanctification consist?

1. In mortification, or dying daily to sin.

2. In vivification, or living daily to Christ. Romans 6.3, 4, 5. Romans 8.11.

Q How are Faith and sanctification confirmed and increased?

A. By the same means that they are begun by, and also by receiving of the
Sacraments.

Q. How many Sacraments be there?

A. Two 1. Baptism, which confirms our Regeneration, or new birth. 2. The
Lords Supper, which signifies and seals our growth in Christ.


Q What is a believers glorification?

A. When death has svvallovved the bodies of Gods faithful Servants, their
blessed souls are taken up to Christ, and svvallovved up in Glory which never
shall have an end. 1. These. 4.17.

Q. What kind of thankfulness and life is that which God requires of all them
that be in this estate by Jesus Christ?

A. The Lord requires of them to answer his infinite love with their love
again, to the praise of Jesus Christ, testified by obedience to the morral
law, observing it (though not as a covenant of works, yet) as a rule of
life, according to his will. John. 14.15, 21.

Q. What is this called?

A. Serving of God. Luke 1.74, 75.

Q How must this be performed?
