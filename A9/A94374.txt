THE TIMES.
EVROPE afflicted, mournes, an Age it may be accounted when ruin is from time
to time; but great Britain, as the last in the world in reservation of
punishment, is assailed with an Inundation of troubles; a Country found no
danger, therefore sought no remedy, as a Province, when a Comet has no
relation to it, fears not; this caused her make no use of others harms, as
wisdom should have done, when a neighbors house is on fire: therefore either
because God chasteneth more the faults of us he loves, a sign of good will,
or because he punishes our errors, he is most obliged to pay with revenge; the
s^urce of which Malady, if we take the Elevation from the past, inward or
outward causes proceed: First, from our sins, which did cast a Epidemicall
Lethargy of unthankefulnesse for mercies received, the greatest sickness, a
conceit of health when most in danger. The second, because there was not
heretofore a perfect union twixt England and Scotland, incorporating both into
one body and mind, if possible it might have been: a reason has caused
Portugal and Catalonia to revolt from the King of Spain, and Transylvania,
Valachia, and Moldavia, under Vayvodes, and not Bashaes, easily elapsed to
disobedience; in these turbulent, and lachrymable times enter the year 1639.
when two Armies in hostile manner oppose each other, but cured with a
pacification, the ulcer not killed, it revived the year 1640. invenoming the
minds of both Kingdoms, as in a hecticke, or rather a burning fever, with
much corrupt matter ascending: caused a new Parocisme to devour the substance
of the King and people, which was prognosticated by divine anger threatened by
the Ministers, the Church conspurgated with errors, the Commonwealth loaded
with projects, Monopolies, and Impositions, a Tyrannical Government propounded
and assaied, Parliamentary ways denied, the Road, and Highway to justice, the
petitions of the people not heard, nor answered, all which chalked out ruin:
whereupon finding their lawful desires made vain, they do not so willingly
obey the sovereigns edicts and commands, finding the Diadem led with
pernicious counsels, so that the Fever of disobedience growing high, the
Scots invaded, our soldiers had no will to fight, the subjects no desire to
pay to such a war, whereby the precepts of the head were of no avail over
purse and spirit to oppose such invasion, this distemper caused the King summon
the Peerary to York to consult and play Physicians to cure the present malady,
with a purpose King and Lords, might do all things without the Commons; but
they out of a sincere mind petitioned his Majesty for a Parliament, because
they could not accomplish the business without common consent, to set in joint
the factions and fractions of the Kingdom, which appeared by the miserable
condition, the face of the Commonwealth was beheld withal, now better by a
thousand degrees (thanks be given to God) for many wrinckles are worn away,
and I hope it will come to be in good health, since the Parliament cannot be
dissolved till all things desired be accomplished, of which the Trienniall
Parliament will be the touchstone to try the truth. But finding the Episcopal
government, caused diverse distempers in the State by introducing new
innovations in the Church, as Altars removed for adoration, a new unlawful
oath imposed by the Canons, and not confirmed by the Parliament, without which
it was of no validity. Secondly, Service said at the Altar, that the greater
part of the people could not hear, and the Pontifical Divines teaching and
preaching in books, and sermons, that the King might invade our liberties;
this caused a research of the Episcopal power, by whose authority this poison
was infused, that a Bill issued from the Commons to the Lords, and passed their
House, in all but one point, which was putting out of the House; but since some
pride from the Bishops and Petitions from some parts of the Kingdom, finding
Church and republike impostumated, the House of Commons has committed a Bil
for the eradicating of root and branch. (Noble Friend) to satisfy the
appetite of your desires, I will tell you the various opinions of men, some
there are haters of Reformation, and pure forms, like those that live in
corrupt air, cannot breath in pure, or used to brackish water, delight not in
sweet fountains; others there are who adhere to Rome, and would have that
form of Church, which but by a pair of sheeres devides from that Hierarchy,
that they might easily in that path go to the Antichristian way, which if it
were hedged up, had no gap to Babylonian errors, for they found none but the
Bishops, and their followers brought in the Arminian and Socinian errors, the
bridges for Popery. Some they say there are who have sucked in errors at the
University by reading Papisticall books, admitted by the Bishops, and allowed
by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and are so infected in judgment, that they
had need of Spectacles to discern the truth, or of eye salve to cure and
clear their judgments. Likewise others affirm many great Ladies, because
they are esteemed, and flattered of Bishops, would have them in their
Pontificalibus, some Protestants whose knowledge is not great, would have them
without other reason giving them, because they have been bred in that way: And
further, the Papists whose Religion for the most part is in reverence and
devotion, are mightily for them, because by that Hierarchy, they confirm their
opinions in Popery, as an antiquity derived from Popish Bishops, who first
instituted, inducted, and confirmed them in the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's
time, so that all our Pontifical Clergy derive the pedegrees of their rites
and ceremonies from Rome, so that if they are not in the first institution,
there may be a retrogradation to Rome by the same steps, as in a maze go back
again the way they came in. The politic sort finding the predominant
constellation of their aim and pride are carried wit^ other considerations,
that Monarchy had better give a loose to Hierarchy; for there is nothing
Aristocraticall but Parliaments, which consists of Lords Spiritual, Lords
Temporal, and Commons, the three last are Aristocraticall: now if one of these
three be dissolved, the Monarchy will shine cleerer, for that none can oppose
the Supremacy of the King in great Britain and Ireland, but the Bishops, who
would, if they had occasion, draw the power to themselves from Rome and Peter,
and disseize his Majesty; moreover some of the Lords. Spiritual being
Temporal Lords, it may be feared there may be Parliaments without the
Temporal Peers, for some of the Bishops are Temporal and Spiritual, so that
it is possible that the Lords Temporal may be barred (which God forbid.) And
further, it is apparent the Commons shall pass nothing, because the Bishops
will not, who sway the Lords House much with the Catholic party and proxies,
for this cause it were fit the Bishops were hindered of votes. Another Argument
is, there is no reason they should take place of their benefactors, which they
do in the Lords House, which will be, if not excluded.

The third reason, the Nobility and Gentry gave land, and were benefa^tors to
Bishops estates, but the erection of Bishops came from the Pope anciently, as
appears by many records, and therefore their erections being Papisticall, they
may come to owe more service to the Pope then to the King, which I leave to the
consideration of ^he Parliament.

Now to declare the opinion of Lawyers not Catholic, there have been
Parliaments say they without Bishops, F. 1.24. a Parliament held. Ex luso Clero
7. R. ^. cap. 3.7. R. 2. cap 12. No Bishops, and many other Parliaments had no
Bishops, and therefore it is the opinion, of the best Lawyers at this day, that
they ought to be put out of the Lords House.

Lastly, how many upright and sincere men have been put out by them, and
silenced.

Now let us touch the antiquity of Bishops, to see whether they have anciently
meddled with temporalities or no: From Christ's time they were only Overseers of
Churches in the Apostolical function and superintendent Pastors of the Church,
appointed so by the Holy Ghost, Acts 20.28. who by common consent did assemble
together, in which for more orderly proceeding in their charges, they choose
one amongst them to be Moderator and President, this is he whom after the
fathers called Bishop; but not merely from Christ and the Apostles, for the
name of all Elders, and Ministers in the beginning was Bishop, which after by
the usual language of the fathers, was appropriated to the Presidentship of
the Elders and Ministers, therefore it was Saint Cyprian reproved the Elders
for receiving those who were fallen away in time of Persecution; before the
Bishop had advised of it with them and others, because they should make
public satisfaction; and therefore I conceive it an error, that they had not
power given before in general Synods, if any should return to the faith to be
restored in the interim to the Church, upon confession and penitency in the
congregation before a Synod called, who otherwise might despair in the mean
time, or by ill counsel fall away, so that it is apparent that Bishops did
deal in matters of the Church government by the counsel and consent of the
Elders and no further; but it is observed, the Bishops in every succession and
in every City caused all orders for to stand as the law, the Prophets, and our
Lord did preach, as Hegesippus said, but how many an Apostolical ways have
they introduced contrary to the Scriptures, witness the reverence to Altars,
kneeling at the Sacrament, and many more; as silencing Ministers for matters of
conscience, for no authority has power of the conscience but God, and nothing
binds the conscience, semper and ad semper, but the decalogue, so that it was
never in the primitive times heard that the Clergy meddled with Temporal
affairs, as they how do, which superabundancy of power causes such
corruption, impurity of Religion, and hurt to the Commonwealth: therefore they
seek to crop their power, or that they may have no more then in the first
institution, and manage affairs of Church with primitive temper, to the good
of the Commonwealth and glory of God, and felicity of the Church, but they
have commanded what they list without control, and are so insolent as of
late, Land Archbishop of Canterburies vices the more visible were by how much
he was more potent in power, and gracious in the Princes eye to persuade the
sequestration of zealous and pious in the Church, and the Majesty to be aloof
off in matter of state, from Ministers able and sincere, or else to give the
Sovereign over to such as might lo^se his subjects hearts, and cause them fall
into the Malady of disobedience, a thing incident to misguided governments, so
he brought in innovations into the Church, making her of a pure Virgin a very
Strumpet.

Ship, Coat, and Conduct money, and other stern impositions he brought in, not
according to abilities, but what the Judges wickedly affirmed to be Law,
constraining inferiors to be instruments in execution, for hope of
advancement, or over awing them by fear; for acts that fill Princes coffers
with unjust demands of money not due, are ever the ruin of the first founders:
times are not bad, but the wicked that live therein make them so, who are the
futhers of ill counsel as well as those who are the begetters of bad children,
which seasons make the best Ministers oftentimes minister fuel to illegal and
wicked desires of great men, wherein Kings themselves pass not blameless, who
choose not instruments by the balance of merit, but with the sails of will and
passionate affection; for as their minds are large in respect of potency, so
their election is rather to satisfy their various humors then solid
judgment, like those who look for the Philosophers stone, and find out
nothing but fine conceits not worthy the looking for. The Bishop alone manageth
the State under the Diadem, chooses his chief instrument Wentworth into
office of best trust, and both together weave the web, whose woofe was the
mislike of the people; flocks that love no fleaing the skin, can endure the
shearing, this violent deporment bred a great distemper in the hearts of
Scotland, and caused the English murmr, and draw to a defection or mutiny,
but no power gotten by wickedness of Ministers is durable, nor to such is any
stability betwixt mediocrity and precipitation, which cause doubtful and
ambiguous speeches of the Sovereign, when the fault ought to be imposed on the
Ministers: so dangerous are the ways of Majesty, that the folly of great ones
strive for ruin. Suppose those misconstructions the multitude have of the
Diadem force Majesty to seek advice and help from strangers, when he cannot
purchase duty at home, what a lamentable consequence may follow, to invite an
ancient enemy to the funeral obsequies of her liberties, the cure being worse
then the disease? And such is our state now, that the House of Commons are
constrained to be helpers, a Theme most displeasing to Sovereignty, though in
a distracted state a rule infallible; on Wentworth the affection of the
Sovereign was so placed, as his power was boundless in Ireland, and here
unsufferable, though a Gentleman of transcendent parts, and of the highest
rank under the degree of Barony, yet of a swoulne ambition which no republike
can endure, for all preferment passes by him, and all suits address to him,
who finding so full a Moon of favor, thought he could not dye for Treason,
the price of his life: surely I blame not a Prince for taking a reposefull
friend to participate his intimate thoughts, to temper the affairs of state,
so as he infects not the effects of his principality, nor sullieth his
parentall respect to the subject, by hatred or Tyranny; but Strafford sick of
the Kings well governing, studied ways of an arbitrary rule, thinking his high
tide of favor would never come to an ebb of fortune, but she fooled him at
last to the loss of all he held in this life most dear; Great must be the art
of ambition to keep afloat the stream of a power* seeing sublimity changes
as the spoke of the wheel, or as the hand of the Dial, at the highest 12.
comes to one, he affected the honor and service of his Master with the ruin
of the subject, beating down competitors of the worthy Patriotship, and
wrought by pride precipitation, when by humility he might have had a good
station, for he should have made it the operation of others, rather then any
appetite of his own to gormondize the property of subjects goods, and swallow
their liberty, putting fetters on the Law, that nothing could be accomplished
but what he and the Archbishop pleased. And lastly, they bar from the King
always to hear the groans of his people, and wickedness of their ministry.
This fatal deport of both might have proved Tragical to the Kingdom, where
the ingredience of popular humor is mixed as well with armed forces not to be
disbanded without great danger, as with a mighty Schismatic party, as well
Papists, Brownists, Anabaptists, people pleased to fish in troubled waters, and
the maleconten^ed Clergy, who have corrupted the pure fountains rather then
they will be depressed in power (it is to be feared) may all act a busy part
in this Tragic story. In such designs Churchmen are never wanting to add
fuel to popular fires, for though they work it not with the meanest, they
effect it by head and chief causing weaknesses in government, and oppression
of people, for it (...) not the best doctrine a w^rr^ with subjects to advance
their Hierarchy, no Bishop, no King, When the first Church rose by fasting and
praying, therefore they ought not so much teach us rulles of loyalty, as to
know out own duties in difficult points of Religion, nor ought they make the
Sovereign believe the Parliament only breath out their passions in a time of
liberty, and express the poverty of their Master to l^ssen his reputation
abroad and credit at home, when then the State is so festred, it is a pain to
fetch out the dead flesh without cor^sives which they are constrained to, to
keep it from gangrening, when that their whole aim next to religion is to
look into the Kings necessities, to discharge the Armies, take away the
impeachments of the Commonwealth, and provide for the royal sustentation much
weakened by bad Counsels, so that he may be potent at home, and glorious
abroad, beginning to set things in order when so great disorder has chalked
the way to amendment, for a mighty expense ever ends in the rapine and spoil
of subjects: but now if it please the King to follow the counsel of
Machiavill, do as the time permits, and be not weary of the strict enquiry of
the Parliament, he shall accomplish as full a Soveraignity as ever, and
greater. This may cause the King with incomparable wisdom to suite himself
to the necessity of the Time, and expect future good from those mean it so
fervently, and act it so painefully. The King delivered of ill counsels, by
this blessed fortune, freed and obeyed, may begin to search the ground of the
misery, why that virtue and fortune, which had settled and maintained so long
his Ancestors in glory of Empire, seems to be in a trance at this time, as if
the Genious of the State had forsaken her, and found out (the way) the reason
of this mischief, namely a wastfull hand too quick for the fortunes and
persons of his people, the griping avarice of Ministers, lawless liberty of
Martial forces, uncivil actions of the Multitude, and affording too much care
to greedy and unworthy Ministers, whose counsel was more subtle then solid,
seeing moderation, reward and punishment, are the supporters of Crowns, and to
be just of word is required of Subjects from Kings themselves, so shall he
effect a wondrous change in the State, bringing the three Kingdoms home with
wonder to his devotion, and their obedience laying his foundation of government
on religion, quietness and justice, so that peace and tranquillity shall attend
a long life though death be let in at last, and fashion to his successors a
most royal pattern to follow from his experience, and authority to make him
superior to Kings, and as he is the first King of his name in our Empire since
the conquest, so shall he be most worthy to be styled Britains CHARLEMAINE, and
be not only capable to govern these three Realms, but the whole world, so
that the wrongs of fortune sometimes make Princes more then their prosperity
both wise and fortunate.

FINIS.
