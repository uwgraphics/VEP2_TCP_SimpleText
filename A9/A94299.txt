A Tender Salutation to the SEED.
FRom the breathing of my life which I feel opening in the bowels of my
Fathers love flowing forth to you, that we may be refreshed one in another; O
thou Seed, thou Heir, thou beautiful branch and plant of the Lord for the
healing of the Nations which shall fly and flock unto thee, as the Doves unto
the windows; O thou beautiful Bride, embrace thy Beloved, who stands ready to
adorn thee, and to put his Comeliness upon thee to purge and purify, and make
an everlasting Covenant with thee to be espoused to thee for ever: this is the
Lamb, the dread of all Nations, the Lamb of God, oh blessed are they that
receive him in the way of his Coming, it is through the suffering, put it not
afar off from you, prise the day of Sion's visitation; oh my soul! praise
thou the Lord for ever, who has hid these things from the wise and prudent,
and revealed them unto Lambs who love thy Law, and delight in Judgment, O let
it be our delight for ever there to be found, in the fiery trial and furnace
of affliction, till the Rebellious be destroyed, thy wrath and fury pacified,
and thy indignation passed over, and thy seed brought forth through the great
tribulation, where the wicked cannot pass: oh the mournful Seed of the
Kingdom! arise, arise, shake off the dust and clods of the earth, let the
grave clothes fall off which oppress the just; press forward, forget what is
behind, shine forth for the glory of the Lord is arisen upon thee; thou art the
Lady of Kingdoms, and the desire of Nations shall be after thee, and all shall
bow and be wearied out before thee that is not of thee, it is the word of the
Lord God that arises in my heart unto thee; for the banner of Gods
Righteousness shall be displayed through thee, and in patience thou shall
overcome, for thou art the Chosen of the Lord, the burdensome stone; he that
smites at thee shall be broken, he that smites shall be smitten, he that has
led captive is the Lord leading into captivity; for this is the stone cut out
of the mountain without hands, that let us see our enemies to be they of our
own house; oh you spiritual plants feel me, you who know from whence wars and
fightings comes, who are exercised in the spiritual warfare, follow, follow,
follow the Lamb who leads out of strife through death to life, through
judgment to mercy, through the daily Cross to the Crown; this is Jesus
manifested in our mortal bodies, praises for ever, praises for ever, oh feel
the rays and overcomings of his life, that my soul is overcomed with that
which flows to you, for my soul is poured forth in the remembrance of you
which abide in your places; keep in the Cross, dwell in the power, stand in the
Authority of the Lord, a witness living, pure, simple, single hearted before
God and man, so keeping peace with all, in the indwellling life with the Lord,
where none can make you afraid, and keep your meetings in the fear, dread, and
power of the Lord God, be not afraid of the threatening of the wicked, nor
overcome with their flatteries, but stand a witness for the Lord, and he will
plead your Cause in their hearts, and deal with them in his own time, oh let
bowels of pity flow forth to them, for they know not what they do, the Lord
forgive them, if it may stand with thy glory, and bring them into Covenant with
thy self; And

Dear friends abide in the Covenenant, keep in the Fathers house, look not out,
let nothing shake your confidence, keep to your first love, in which you were
gathered, in the light which is eternal and unchangeable, and shall remain and
abide for ever, though Gods enemies may be suffered to remove us into holes and
prisons for the trial of our faith, but the Teacher has manifested his love
unto us, through the anointing, that teaches us, that shall never be removed
into a corner: So dear Lambs learn of him, who cares for you, who will
instruct and direct you by the pourings forth of his holy spirit upon you; And

Dear friends, turn in, see the end for which the Lord has chosen you and your
standing in him, who has all time in his hand, Center not below him, but
follow him, for great is the Call and high, wherewith the Lord has called us,
seek not to be at ease, join not to the oppressor, keep to that which divides
and separates, so shall you be made a blessing in the hand of the Lord, and not
look down, but dwell in the longsufferings, in the patience, and God will give
you the heathen for your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
the possession of the Righteous Seed in you, and you shall be made the praise
of the whole earth, and your enemies shall become your friends, as in some
measure they are seen in this trying day in the hand of the Lord, doing service
for him; so be not troubled at them, for the Lord has the disposing of them,
amd what they have done, the work laid out for them to do, the Lord will
either bring them in, or lay them aside, for all power is in his hand; good is
the name of the Lord, it is as precious ointment poured forth to us who feel
the drawings of the cords of his love, oh let our souls delight to dwell with
him, in whom there is no weariness, nor shadow of turning, but we may run
the race with patience, in the ways of his Commandments, there to delight our
souls in the ocean of his life, to drink of the river of his pleasure, that we
may live and grow and shine forth, serving the Lord in fear, and our generation
in faithfulness, quitting our selves like men walking clear of all, that the
blood of none may be required at our hands, not loving our lives to death to do
his will: This is the desire of your suffering brother, we may all here be
found a sweet savor to the Lord, and one unto another, unto the end, and in
the end.

Amen.
Written in York Castle, by your dear Brother, and lover of your souls, known
unto you by the name of Samuel Thornton.
