To the right Honorable, Our right worthy and grave Senators, the Lord
Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty of the City of London in Common Council
assembled, The most humble Petition and Address of diverse young men, on the
behalf of themselves and the APPRENTICES in and about this honorable City,
Most humbly shows,
IT has pleased the good and only wise GOD for our and the Nations crying
sins to manifest his displeasure for many years together against these our
flourishing, now sadly divided, distracted, and almost ruined Nations: and yet
blessed be God, this Honorable City hitherto has been no proportionable
sharer in the calamities which our Brethren in other parts of these now
miserable Nations have suffered, which are now aggravated by our divisions, and
such a general decay of trading, as does exceed the worst of former times; all
which we look upon, as a most sad presage of some part and dismal judgment very
near at hand, if not our sudden ruin^ together with the destruction and utter
dissolution both of Church and State, which will inevitably ensue as a just
reward upon our multiplied provocations, under the most signal manifestations
of Gods most gracious presence and the most engaging mercies that ever people
did enjoy (unless it please our most gracious GOD whose name has been
exceedingly dishonored by the violation of many sacred and solemn Oaths)
amongst us to work our deliverance out of this contexture of dangerous
mischiefs, into which we have already wound our selves: or which as the
inundations of mighty waters may suddenly break in upon us: and being sadly
sensible of the calamities, under which the three Nations groan for want of a
well ordered and established Government. We being members in the same
political body cannot but sympathize with the rest of our Brethren: and
forasmuch as your endeavors may contribute very much thereto, and the well or
ill management of your Talents, in the discharge of your Trusts may now make
these Nations happy or else leave them irrecoverably miserable. We hold our
selves obliged in conscience to GOD and our Country, both by the Laws of GOD
and the Land, in the behalf of our selves, and all good and peaccable people
in the Land, and the many thousands that know not their right hand from their
left; and in the behalf of the Children unborn who in time to come, may have
cause to bless or curse the day of their birth for your sakes, do make this
humble Address to you, as the only means under GOD now left us to redress
these growing misschiefs which make us and the three Nations in these times of
our great trouble cry unto you (as those of Mac^donia did in the Apostles
Vision) C^e and h^lp us. And we beseech you, our most Grave and Worthy
Senators, as you tender the welfare of these bleeding Nations to stand in the
wide gap of our breaches, with your prayers, improving your Councils, and every
Talent (which God has reposed in you) for the honor of God, and the peace of
his Church by a real reformation, and we question not but our most gracious
GOD will then break through the thick Clouds of these black and dark
providence, and return unto us our Judges as at the first, and our
Counselors as all the beginning, with the abundance of the blessings of peace
that judgment may run down our streets, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
And we humbly desire the two great Pill^rs of the Land Magistry and M^ may be
asserted and encouraged: in order unto which, we humbly present to your Crave
and serious Considerations;

First, the Privileges of the Gospel which we do enjoy at this day in the
faithful preaching and dispensing of Gods holy Word and Sacraments, together
with the labors of so many of his faithful servants in the Ministry, and the
liberty of these sacred Ordinances being the best and choicest of our National
blessings; in respect of which, we may well say (with holy David) God has not
dealt so with any Nation: which with thankfulness we desire to acknowledge as
a great mercy to the Land: And should the Lord remove his Candlestick out of
his place (as we have just cause to fear he will, unless we do repent.) Then
may we indeed complain with Phineas his Wife, the glory is departed from our
Israel, and a dark and dismal night of black and gloomy Ignorance, Error and
Profaneness will invelope our valley of vision. And to the end that this
choice Blessing (which we account more precious th^^ our lives) may be conveyed
to Posterity. We most humbly desire the Ministry may be countenanced and
encouraged, the Universities uphold and maintained, which have nursed many
famous Preachers for piety and learning in this and former ages, and your
Authourity used for the terror of evil doers, but the praise of them that do
well.

Secondly, we esteem and assert as our undoubted birth right, the freedom and
privileges of our Parliaments, as being the great Charter of the people of
England, which we account equally dear with our lives, in the enjoyment of
which we yet hope under GOD to see a happy and lasting settlement both in
Church and State. Therefore we most humbly desire that a new election may be
made, or else that those worthy Gentlemen chosen to serve as members in the
late free Parliament, may be restored to their privileges, and sit without
disturbance or force from the Army. That they may consider in this evil time,
what England, Scotland and Ireland ought to do, which (with submission to your
Grave judgments) we humbly conceive to be the most probable means under GOD to
establish the true Protestant Religion, reform the Laws, secure our Liberties
and preserve our lives and outward concernments, to promote Learning, and
encourage Virtue, whereby peace with our neighbor Nations may be renewed and
established, the Army satisfied, their Arrears paid, and Trading restored. In
all which, most Grave and worthy Senators, your own concernments (as well as
ours) are so deeply engaged, that we persuade our selves you will be
isntrumental to further our desires, by all peaceable and lawful means, and
we hope it will put an end to our divisions, which (if GOD in mercy prevent
not) may soon break out into another civil War, and render us as a prey to a
foreign enemy, For a Kingdom divided against it self cannot stand.

Now we leave it unto you our most grave and worthy Senators, duly to
consider if you part with these our great National blessings, whether you will
not discover a palpable breach of trust, and leave your names for a reproach to
the generations following, who will in the ages to come rise up and call you
blessed, if you be careful to preserve them now, and convey them to Posterity:
And now We beseech the Lord to strengthen both your hearts and hands; and give
you wisdom from on high to direct you in all your Consultations, as may be
most for the honor of God, the peace of his Church throughout the World, and
the settlem^nt, safety, and happiness of these poor Nations; And by his
assistance we resolve to stand by you and with you to the utmost hazard of our
lives and all that is dear unto us, to promote the same.

Monday 5. December.
This day the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Common Council being assembled, the
fore-recited Petition was presented by several young men and Apprentices, in
the behalf of themselves and several thousands which have subscribed the same;
the which being received, was ordered to be read, and thereupon a Committee
chosen to consider thereof, and to give their speedy report unto the next Court
concerning the same.

At the same Court it was likewise Ordered, that the Lord General Fleetwood
should be desired to draw off the Soldiers unto their several quarters; it
being then also Ordered that every Common Council man in his several precinct,
should give notice to the Housekeepers within the same, that they should keep
their Servants and Apprentices at home, thereby to preserve the peace of the
City.
