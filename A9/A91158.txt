The Stationer to the Reader.
Reader.
I Have with much importunity after many denialls obtained a perfect Catalogue
of all Printed Books, written by William Prynne of Lincolnes-Inne, Esquire; and
here published it, not out of any vain glorious Ostentation of the Authors
indefatigable industry, and good service to this Church and Commonwealth, but
principally for these two Reasons.

First, To free the Author from those Spurious Impostures which have been
injuriously fathered on him by Walker the Ironmonger, and others, to his
dishonor, and the Readers delusion.

Secondly, To prevent all Imperfect Catalogues, (intended for the Press
without his privity) and to discover what Copies of his have been published by
Erroneous Manuscripts, varying from the Original, without his knowledge, (by
some who aimed more at their own private benefit, then the public) his only
end in compiling all these ensuing Treatises, was Gods glory, the public good
of our Church and State, not any private gain (he freely giving all his Coppies
to those who Printed them, and never taking penny for any of them:) let it be
thine and thy souls good, only in perusing them. So wishes his Stationer,

Michael Spark, Senior.
