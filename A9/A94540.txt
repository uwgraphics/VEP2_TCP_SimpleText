To the Kings most Excellent Majesty.
The humble Petition of the Gentry, Ministers, Freeholders, and other
Inhabitants of the County of YORK, Assembled by His Majesty's special Summons
at Heworth Moore near the City of YORK, on Friday the third of June, 1642.
Shows,
THat this particular County, most affectionate to your Majesty's service, has
well nigh for these three years last past been the stage, whereon the
Tragical miseries, which necessarily accompany war and Armies, have been
presented and acted, whereby the general wealth and plenty of this County is
exhausted and brought very low: Which weight of miseries are sensibly become
much more heavy, by reason of your Majesty's distance in residence, and
difference in Counsels, from your Great Council the Parliament; begetting
great distempers and distractions throughout the Kingdom, and have specially
amongst us produced factions and divisions, drawing into these parts great
numbers of discontented persons, that may too justly be feared do affect the
public ruin, for their private advantage. All which evils are daily fomented,
and made more formidable, by your Majesty's drawing together (as we conceive
not according to Law) many Companies of the Trained Bands, and others both
Horse and Foot, of this County; and retaining multitudes of Commanders and
Cavaleers from other parts; and by the daily resort of Recusants, and persons
disaffected in Religion, to your Majesty's Court at York; and by the great
preparation of Arms, and other warlike provisions, which begets in us fears of
Wars, to the great ter^our and amazement of us, your Majesty's peaceable
Subjects; and to the great decay of all Commerce and industrious Courses, for
the wealth and prosperity of the Country, especially of Clothing, which is the
maine subsistence of this County, and is since your Majesty's residence amongst
us, and the following distractions thereupon, suddenly obstructed; insomuch
that many thousand families, who are of, and have their livelihood by the Trade
of Clothing, are now at the point of utter undoing; which inevitably will
prove to be of dangerous consequence, and will be the inlet to our approaching
and unavoidable ruin, unless your Majesty please graciously to give redress,
by removing the causes which produce these miserable effects, it being too
true, that very many, in these and other parts of the Kingdom, do wholly
withdraw themselves from their former Commerce and Dealing: and others, both
Merchants and Chapmen, do now generally refuse to make payment for Goods long
since sold and delivered; alleging, that others refuse to pay them for any
Commodity formerly sold, till the fears and distractions of the Land be
settled: Which if not suddenly prevented, will forthwith over-turne all such
ways of advantage and comfort as have formerly made this Kingdom (and this
County in particular) prosperous and happy.

We do therefore in all humility and duty, in the sense of our present
deplorable condition, beseech your Majesty to pardon Us, if We importune Your
Majesty more than others, since We have endured and are in hazard more than
any; and that from these apprehensions, we may offer to Your Majesty our
earnest Petition, for redress and prevention of these evils daily threatening
danger to Your Majesty, and destruction to us; which we conceive is impossible
any other way to be effected, than by Your Majesty's entertaining a right
understanding betwixt Your Self and Parliament, and affording Your Gracious
ear and consent to such counsels and Propositions, as shall be tendered by
them to Your Majesty, for the honor and greatness of Your Majesty and
Posterity, and the good of this Church and Kingdom, and by Your Majesty's
declining all other Counsels whatsoever, and uniting Your confidence to Your
Parliament: and that Your Majesty would in no way think fit to put us upon that
rock of dividing the duty we owe to Your Majesty, Your Parliament, and the
whole Kingdom, to which we are so deeply engaged by our Protestation, which
Your Majesty (to our knowledge) never dissented from, nor declared against; and
that whilst Your Majesty expects our performance in one part thereof, we may
not (being equally engaged) impeach at all, or in the least degree go less
than our duty in the other, (which we stand resolved of) by no means either
of fear or favor to be drawn to do: and that Your Majesty would take into
consideration, that Your Parliament being the supreme Judicatory of Your
Kingdom, the very essence thereof must of very necessity be destroyed, if
their Counsels and determinations be subjected to alteration, or reversall, by
the Counsels or opinions of any private persons, how learned or judicious
soever; and seeing your Majesty has passed an Act, that this Parliament shall
not be dissolved, or adjourned, without consent of your Majesty and both
Houses, We humbly beseech your Majesty to take into your gracious and
provident thoughts, that nothing may be done tending thereunto, and that the
Lords and great Officers now called hither by your Majesty's command, may
speedily return to the high Court of Parliament, whereby it may be evident to
the world, that your Majesty intends not to deciine the Law so enacted; and
that since your Majesty has graciously declared your confidence in the
affections of this County, Your Majesty would not think it fit an
extraordinary Guard should be raised ther^out, and the Cavaliers, and others
of that quality still continued about your Majesty as men most usesull, and as
if kept for some design; they not having (for ought we know) either interest
in, or affections to the public good, their language and behavior speaking
nothing else but division and war, and their advantage consisting in that which
is most destructive to others. And lastly, that since your Majesty has called
in this County to attend your Majesty this day, your Petitioners do most
humbly supplicate, that none either Cavaliers, or others, (who in truth have
not present fortunes in this County) may be admitted into any meeting this
day, concerning the public business thereof, or hereafter into any present
Vote, or Consultation, when any further meeting may be, to prepare and consider
of some fit answer to what your Majesty shall propound; we humbly conceiving it
neither just nor equal (but a thing to be protested against) that any
whosoever should be thrust upon us, as men of this County, that are not either
by their fortune or residence any part of us.

And now your Petitioners do even heartily pray, that the God of Heaven (in
whose hand are the hearts of Kings) would this day incline your Majesty's heart
seriously to consider these present and imminent miseries that this your
Kingdom now groans under; in the peace whereof (visibly under God) consists
the preservation of the Protestant Religion, the redemption of our Brethren in
Ireland, and the establishment of that Kingdom to your Majesty and Posterity,
from those desperate and unparaleld Rebels; that so your Majesty might
graciously grant these your Petitioners humble desires; which (whatsoever will
be said to the contrary) your Petitioners are well assured would abundantly
redound to the glory of God, the honor and safety of your Majesty the good of
your Posterity, and the only probable means, under God, with peace and plenty
to make this your Kingdom happy; besides the acquisition of your peoples
hearts, the greatest treasure of Princes: all which will gloriously represent
your Majesty a lively portraiture of him, who is the fountain of Wisdom and
Piety: To whom we shall ever pray for your Majesty's long and prosperous
Reign.
