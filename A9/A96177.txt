TERRIBLE NEVVES FROM SCOTLAND: OR, A true Declaration of the late Council of
the Kingdom of SCOTLAND, and how far they have proceeded in the raising of
their forces with an exact representation of their Genealogies, lives, and
Manners, WRITTEN, By a Gentleman employed in the Service for the Public, and
dedicated to the Commissioners of SCOTLAND.

LONDON, Printed for T. W. 1647.

A true Declaration of the late Council of the Kingdom of Scotland.
HAving had the fortune (honor I will not say) to be employed in weighty
affairs of the public, between this my native Kingdom of England, and the
neighbor Kingdom of Scotland, and collecting from time to time with the
greatest industry I could, the several most material passages observable,
during the time of my sad employment, at last seeing no end of the case I
undertook, I composed my self to a retired life and began to reflect upon the
Diary of my last five years action, which now seems to me as one in a
continued trance, and often brings to my mind that of the Psalmist, Man walks
in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain. And now as the stopping
of me in that Careere, was a sign of Gods special favor unto me, so I now
publish this relation in testimony of my thankfulness and repentance.

First, for the Country I must confess it is to good for those that possess
it, and too bad for those that will be at charge to conquer it; the air might
be wholesome but for the stinking people that inhabit it,, ^he ground might be
made fruitful, had they wit to measure it; their beasts are generally small,
their weomen only accepted, of which sort the world I think has not greater;
there is store of foul, foul houses, foul linen, foul d^shes, and pots,
foul napkins and trenchers, foul sheets and shirts, with which sort of foul
they have been forced to fare as the children of Israel did with their foul in
the wilderness. They have good store of fish, and good for them that can eat
it raw; for if it but once come in their hands, it is presently worse then if
it were three days old; For their butter and cheese I Will not meddle with them
at this time, nor no man else at any time that loves his life. They ha ve great
store of Dear also, but so far from the places I have seen, that I had
rather believe it then go to disprove it: all the dear I meet withal, was
dear Lodging, dear Horse meat, dear Tobacco, and English beer, as for
fruit, for their Grandmother Eves sake they never planted any, and for other
trees had Christ been betrayed in this land as doubtless he should have
been, had he come a stranger amongst them, Judas had sooner found the grace of
repentance then a tree to hang himself on. They have many H^lls wherein they
say is much Treasure, but they have none of it; nature has only discovered to
them some Mines of Coals to show to what end she created them, I se little
grass but in pottage, and no flowers but such as (modesty forbids me to name)
the Thistle was not given them for naught; for it is the fairest flower in the
Garden: the word Hay is Heathen Greek to them, neither man nor beast knows
what it means, Corn is reasonable plentiful at this time for since they heard
of the Kings coming, it ha^h been as unlawful for the common people to eat
Wheat, as it was in old time for any bu^ Priests to eat Shewbread: they prayed
much for his coming, and fasted longer for his welfare, all his followers was
welcome but the Guard, those they said were like Ph^roes lean Kine, and
threaten a dearth where they come: they would persuade Footmen that Oaten Cakes
would make them long winded, and the Children of the Chapel they have brought
to eat them for the maintenance of their voices: they said our Cooks were too
saucy, and for Grooms and Coachmen they gave their horses no worse then they
might be content to eat themselves: they commend the brave minds of Pentinors,
and the Gentlemen of the Chamber, that choose rather to go to Tavernes, then to
be always eating of the Kings provisions; as likewise the Pages and Yeomen of
the Buttery, for their retiredness and silence, in that they will have 20
knackes, before they will answer one: they persuade the Trumpeters, that
fasting is good for men of their quality; for emptiness causes wind, and wind
makes the Trumpet sound the bringing in of Harralds they think was a
needless Charge, they all know their pedegres well enough, and the Harbingers
might have been spared since they brought so many beds with them, and of two
evils since the least is to be chosen, they wished that the beds might be left
with them, and the poor Harbingers do their Office as they return. His
hangings they desire may remai^e here as Relinques to put them in mind of his
Majesty, and they promised to despence with the wodden Images; but for his
graven ones in his new beautified Chapel* they threaten to pull them down
soon after his departure, and make of them a burnt Off^ring, to appease the
indignation; they conceive the Almighty bears them for suffering such Idolatry
to enter into the Country: the Organs may sound because they say they have some
affinity with Bagg-pipes, the Skiper that brought the singing men with their
Papisticall vestiments, complains that he has been much troubled ever since
with a singing in his head; for remedy whereof the Parson of the Parish has
persuaded him to sell that profane vessel, and to destribute the money among
the frighted brethren; for his Majesty's entertainment, he was received into
the Parish of Edinburgh, for a City I cannot call it, with a great shout and
cry, but no shows of charge; for Pagans they hold Idolatrous things, and not
fit to be received in so reformed a place. From the Castle they gave him some
Pieces of Ordnance which surely he gave them since he was King of England, and
at the entrance of the Town the presented him with a goulden Basin, which was
carried before him on men's shoulders to his palace, from whence I think it
came. They protested if Christ came from heaven, he could not have been much
welcomer, which I believe. Since his Majesty came but to summon them to
Parliament, and Christ would have summoned them to Judgment which they love not
to hear of, he was conveyed by the Yorkers of the town, who were about 200
Halbert bearers, who will rue it in respect of the charge to the Cross^, and so
the high Church, where the only Bell they had, stood on tiptoe to behold his
fair fac^, where I must entreat you to stay for an hour, I confess I left
him. To report the speeches made for his meaner entertainment would be to
tedious for you* as the Sermon was for those that were constrained to endure it
out. After the preachment he was conducted to his palace, which I forbear to
speak of, but it is a place sanctfied to his devine Majesty, only I wish it
had been well walled for my friends sakes that waited on him, to bring the
Major back who all the while attended on his Majesty, were to much to amplyfie
my story, the gentlemen lodged 2 stairs high, I will only faithfully and
briefly spoke of the people, according to their degrees; For the Lords spituall
they may be well so called, being neither fish nor flesh, but what it shall
please their earthly God the King to make them. Obedience they hold to be
better then sacrifice, making a mock of Martyrdom, by saying Christ dyed for
them, and not they for him: they will rather subscribe then surrender, or
rather dispense with small things then trouble themselves with great
imputations, they will rather acknowledge the King to be their head, then want
wherewith to pomper their bodies: they have taken great pain^s and trouble
(...) compass their Bishopticks, and they will leave them for a trifle; For
the Deacons whose desert will not advance them* all they study is to discharge
them as have got the least degree before them. And because they cannot write
Bishop they proclaim they never heard of any in the Scriptures; they spoke of
Deacons and Elders, but not a word of Deacons and Bishops, their words are full
of detraction, their Sermons nothing but railing, and their conclusion^
herresies and treasons, that religion they have I confess is above my reach,
and God willing I will never stretch for it; They Christen without the Cross,
and marry without a Ring, receive thk Sacrament without reverence, die without
repentance, and bury without divine service. They keep no holy days nor
acknowledge no Saint but St. Andrew, who say they got that hononr by presenting
Christ with an eaten cake after his 40 days fast. They say likewise that he
that translated the English Bible was the son of some malter, because he spoke
of a miracle done by barley loaves, where^s they will swear tw^s done by many
thousands. They use no prayer at all, for they say it is needles, God knows
their wants, without their prattling, what he does h^ does freely, Sabbath days
exercise is a preaching in the forenoonc to hear the Law, and to the cragg and
clifts in the afternoon to louze themselves; they hold their nose if you speak
of a beare-baiting and stop their ears if you take of a play, fornic^tion they
hold but a pastime wherein men's abilities are approved, and the fertility of a
woman discovered; adultry they shake the head at, theft they rail at, murder
wink at, and bl^sp^emy they laugh at, they think it impossible to loose the
way to heaven if they can but leave Rome behind, to be opposite to the Pope is
to be present with God, To conclude, I am verily persuaded if God and his
Angels should come down in white garments, they would (...)e aw^y and cry out
the Children of the Chapel are come again, to meet us, let us fly from the
abom^nation of th^se boys, and hide us in the wilderness^* For the Lords
temporal, and temporizing Lords and Gentlemen if I were apt to spea^ of any I
would not say much of them, only I must tell them they are Scottishmen, for as
soon as they fall from the breasts of the beasts their mother, their careful
Siers posts then away for France, where as they pass ^he sea, sucks from them
that which they sucked from their rude dames: there they gather new flesh, new
blood, new manners, there they learn to speak, to stand, to congie with weomen,
and to complement with men, to put on their clothes, and to return them into
the Country to ware them: they have spared no cost to honor the King, no
complementall courtisie to welcome Country men* there followers are there
fellow^* their wives their slaves, their horses their masters, and their
svvords their Judges* Therefore there are but few Lawyers, and those not rich:
their Parliament holds but three dai^s, their Statutes 3 lives, and are
determined in 3 words, the wonders of the buttery are these, the Lord
Chancellor is beloved, the Mr. of the Roules well spoken of, the whole
Council who are judges in all causes free from suspicion of corruption The
Land though it be mountanous affords no monsters but VVeomen* of which the
Countesses and Ladies are ^ept in Cages like our bore franks, through which
peeping sometimes to catch the air, we are almost frghted at the sight of
them. The greatest madness among the men is ^^^o^^ie, making such solicitous
care to ^eep that which none have but 2 of their senses would seek to take
from them. The Ladies are of opinion that Susanna could not be chaste because
she bathed often: pride is a thing breed in their bones and their flesh
naturally abhors cleanliness, their breath commonly stinketh of pottage,
their linn^n of piss their hands of Pigs turds, their whole body of sweat
and their splay feet ever offend, notvvithstanding their stocks to be chained
in marriage with one of them, wear to be tied to a dead carcass and cast
into a stin^ing ditch. Fucus or a Darby frieze, are things that they d^eame not
of, the Ointments among them most frequent are brimstone and butter for the
scald, and oil of baies and stavesa^er for the lice, which lately out of
curiosity is but newly crept into the Kingdom, and I think will not long
continue. I prefesse I had rather be the meanest minnion then the f^i^est
Countess I have yet seen or discovered. To dravv you down from the Citisens
wife to the country common dames vve^e to bring you from Nevvgate to
Bridevvell. The despised dames (...) Seacoale lane are things of immortal
race, every on in Hounsditch that converse in rags and maribones are Hellens
to them, the greasy bauds in turnball-street are Gree(...) Dames in comparison
of them. To conclude the woman of ^ury in old time did out more vvonder that
the great Messiah should be born.
