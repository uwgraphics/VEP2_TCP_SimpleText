TO The Right Honorable and Noble Lord, The EARL of LOVDEN, Chancellor of
Scotland; AND Chancellor of the University of St. Andrews, Grace, Mercy and
Peace.
RIGHT HONORABLE,
AS Jesus Christ the wonderful, the Isa. 9. 6.
Counselor, the mighty God drives on his great State-design in the whole
Earth, and now in these Kingdoms, to to save an afflicted people, to dye his
Garments in the blood of his Enemies, and to build the Tabernacle of God
amongst men, and cause the wilderness blossom as a Rose, that the Isa. 35 1, 2.
glory of Lebanon, and the excellency of Carmel and Sharon may in a spiritual
manner be given to Zion; So he still acts in his own sphere of Righteousness,
and all inferior wheels in their revolutions move toward his most eminent end;
for the Courtiers and Royal Attendants Psalm. 97. 1.
of his Throne are Righteousness and Judgment. And he desires that the motions
and ways of his people may be concentrick to his own heart, and Vel lubentes,
vel vi attracti decreta Dei se quamur necesse est.
move in the same Orb with himself; we must either walk, or be drawn to the end
of Jesus Christ, his end cannot come down and comply with our policy. When men
go with one head, and two faces, and two hearts, Providence can beguil them: we
are then safe, and do sail at the Haven of the Sea when we walk with God, and
our way draws a straight line to the heart of Jesus Christ. These two
Kingdoms have before them an end* the Covenant to be a people to God; this we
did Swear with our Hands lifted up to the most High; the stones of the field
shall witness against us, and the Sword of the Lord avenge the quarrel of his
Covenant, if we dally with the Lord, as if the Vow of God, that the Lord may be
one, and his Name one in both Kingdoms had been on us, when we were low only,
and our Oath had a date only till the Year 1645. and then our Vow must exspire,
as did the Law of shaddows, when the Body Jesus Christ came. As success is a
poor and waxy Calendar for Religion, so the low condition of our Kingdom, I
hope, shall not move us to forsake the Lords cause, or to blame God, because
good causes have sometimes sad events; for beside that Heathens said, that God
cannot err, because Marius ex culpa gloriam reportavit, Marius was made
glorious by ill-doing, and one has a Cross, Ille crucem sceleris pretium
tulit, hic diadema. Iuven. Saty. 10.
another a Kings Crown for a reward of wickedness, we know that God, however
it be, is good to Israel. If that which was intended for Union, shall by men's
wickedness, turn to a sad Division between the Kingdoms, I shall believe, that
the truly Godly of either Kingdoms, can scarce be capable of such bloody
intentions, as shall leave a Legacy of perpetuated blood to the Posterity; and
sure, though for the present guiltiness, strength prevail, yet habent Deum
ultorem, men on Earth cannot long be strong against Vengeance from Heaven. As
success does inebriate, so extremity of a low condition is a wicked
Counselor; and evil Jealousy, as Hell, thinks always evil. All whose
bowels are moved for the Desolation, Graves, multiplied Widows and Orphans of
both Kingdoms will not dare (Judgment from the Almighty being a terror to
them) to add affliction to the people of God already afflicted. Blessed shall
they be of the Lord, who mediate for preventing of National ruptures, and for
the continuance of the Brotherly Covenant. Christ Jesus is a uniting Savior,
one God, one Faith, one Lord Jesus, one Religion should be, and I beseech the
God of Peace, they may be Chains of Gold to tie these tipo Nations and Churches
together in uno tertio, that they may be concentered and united in one Lord
Jesus. O that that precious Dew of Hermon, that showers of Love and Peace may
lie all the night upon the Branches of the two Olive Trees, that the warmness,
heat, and influence of one Sun of Righteousness with healing in his wings, may
make the Lilly amongst the Thorns, the Rose of Sharon, that is planted by the
Lord, the Spouse of Jesus Christ in both Kingdoms to spread its Root, and cast
its Smell, as green and flourishing to all the Nations round about. The Kingdom
of God is Peace. The Lord is about a great work in Britain, why should
Divisions that proceed from the lusts of men* and the enemies of the Lord
retard the wheels of the Chariot of Christ? Let us not water the Lilly with
blood again. The Sons of Babel have shed our blood in great abundance, for the
which does the Church of God in the three Kingdoms stand, and Pray and Prophecy
in sackcloth. The violence Ier. 51. 35.
done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the Inhabitants of Zion say:
And my blood upon the Woman arrayed in Purple and Scarlet, the Mother of
Harlots and Abominations Rev 17. 3. 5.
of the Earth, shall Jerusalem say. Happy we, if we could for the second Temple
builded, and the Lord repairing the old waste places, and the Gentiles Isa. 62.
1, 2*
beholding the Righteousness of the Elder Sister the Church of the Jews, and
both as a Crown of Glory in the hand of the Lord, and as a Royal Diadem in the
hand of our God.

I shall not need, I hope, either of an Apology for Intituling this Piece, such
as it is, (others can, and I hope will add riper Animadversions to Erastus) to
Your Honors Name, or of a word of incitement, that Your Lordship cooperate
with Your serious Endeavors, for a right understanding between both Kingdoms,
and for the carrying on the work of the right arm of the Lord, the Lords
creating of glory on every Assembly on Mount Zion, (for we are witnesses of
Your Honors Travels for both) that glory may dwell in our Land.

Your Honors at all respective observance in the Lord, S. R.

To the Ingenuous and Equitable Reader.
IT lies obvious to any ordinary underderstanding (worthy Reader) that as
always we see a little portion of God; so now, the Lord our God in his acting
on Kingdoms and Churches, makes Darkness his Pavilion, to find out the (...)
and the Demonstrative Causes and true Principles of such bloody conclusions and
horrible vastations, as the Sovereign Majesty of Heaven and Earth has made in
Germany, Bohemiah, and the Palatinate, as if they were greater sinners then we
are; and why the windows of Divine Justice have been opened to send down such a
deluge of blood on Ireland; and why in Scotland the Pestilence has destroyed
in the City, and the Sword of the Lord, not a few in the fields, (their Lovers
and Friends standing aloof from their calamities) is from the Lord who is
wonderful in Counsel; but to find reasons to quiet the understanding, is not
an easy scrutiny: matters are rolled on Job 37. 23. Job 33. 13.
invisible wheels. It is enough to us (...) no Men, no Angels can hunt out the
tracings of Divine Providence; Nor can we set a day of Law, nor erect a Court
to implead this Lord, who is not holden in Law, to answer for any of his
matters: It were our wisdom to acknowledge that the actions of our Lord, ad
extra, are so twisted and interwoven thread over thread, that we can see but
little of the walls and outworks of his unsearchable counsels; sure, Divine
Providence has now many irons in one fire, and with one touch of his finger he
stirt^^h all the wheels in Heaven and Earth.

I speak this, if happily this little piece may cast it self in the eye of the
Noble and Celebrious Judges and Senators who now sit at the ^e^m* for I hope
they consider, it is but a short and sorry Line, or rather a poor Circle, Job
1. 21. Genesis 3. 19. between the Womb and the Grave, between Dust and Dust* and
that they then act most like themselves ( Psalm. 82. 6. I have said ye are Gods)
when they remember they are sinful men, and when they reckon it for gain, that
the King of Ages gives them a Diurnal of 24 hours to build the House of the
Lord, to cause the heart of a Widow Church (though her Husband live for
evermore) to sing for joy, and are eyes to the blind, and legs to the lame;
and withal do mind, that when the Spirit is within half a Cubit, or the sixth
part of a Span to Eternity, and Death cannot adjou^n for six hours* to repent*
or do any more service to Christ in the body, the welcome and testimony of God,
shall be incomparably above the Hosanna's of men. Undeniable it is, that we
destroy again what we have builded, if we behead the Pope, and divest him of
his Vicarious Supremacy, and soader the Man of Sins head, in the Ecclesiastical
Government, to the shoulders of any Man, or Society of men on Earth. It is not
an enriching spoil to pluck a Rose or Flower from the Crown of the Prince of
the Kings of the Earth. Diamonds and Rubi^s picked out of the Royal Diadem of
Jesus Christ, adds but a poor and sorry Luster to Earthly Supremacy; it is
Baldness in stea^ of Beauty.

An Arbitrary power in any, whether in Prince or ^ relats, is intolerable. Now
to cast ou^ Domination in one, and to take it in in another, is not to put away
the Evil of our doings, but to Barter and Exchange one sin with another, and
mockingly to expiate the Obligation of one Arrear to God, by contracting new
Debt. Again, how glorious is it, that Shields of the Earth lay all their
Royalty and Power level with the dust before him that sits on the Throne,
and to make their Highness but a Scaffold to heighten the Throne of the Son of
God? Yea, if Domination by the Sword be the Magistrates Birthright, as the
Word of Truth teaches us, Luke 22. 25, 26. Psalm. 82. 1, 6. Romans 13. 4. and the
Sword can never draw blood of the Conscience; It is evident that the Lord Jesus
allows not Carnal weapons to be used within the walls of his Spiritual
Kingdom; and if Power be an enchanting Witch, and like strong Drink, which is
dolosus luctator, a cosening Wrestler, we are to be the more cautelous and
circumspect, that it incroach not upon Jesus Christ, for fear that we provoke
the eyes of his glory, and cause Jerusalem to be plowed, and Zion become heaps,
and many houses great and fair, desolate.

Let the Appeal be to the Spirit that speaks to the Churches in the Word: The
Golden Reed can measure every Cubit of the Temple; as well the outer Porch, as
the Holy of Holiest, and all the dimensions, the length and breadth of the City
which is named (...)* The Lord is there. If the Scripture be no Rule of Church
Government, but the Magistrates Sword be upon the shoulders of Christ, as the
prime Magistrate; we come too near to the Jewish, Earthly, and Temporary
Mes^iah. And if Excommunication and Censures, and that Ministerial Governing
which was undeniably in the Apostolic Church, be Fictions, we are in the dark.
I confess, we know not whether the Vessels of the House should be of Gold and
Silver, or if they should be but Earthen Pitchers.

It is said, That all this is but a Plea for a Dominion of an higher Nature,
even over the Consciences of men by Censures. But why a Dominion? Because a
power of Censures? Surely, if they were not Spiritual Censures, and such as
has influence on the Conscience, we should yield a Domination were the
business. But this power of Censuring Spiritually, is as strong as
Authoritative in Dispensing Rebukes, Threats, Gospel-charges and Commands in
the Word Preached, as in Censures; The power is Ministerial only in the Word,
not Lordly; and why should it be deemed a Dominion, and an Arbitrary power in
the one, and not in the other?

If the will of the Magistrate may carve out any Government that seems good to
him, and the Word of God in this plea be laid aside, as perfect in Doctrine,
but imperfect and useless in Government, we fall from the Cause. But if the
Word of God stand as a Rule in matters of Church Government; then the Question
is only, on whose shoulders the Ark should be carried; and by whose Ministry
does Jesus the Lord and King of the House punish (if I may use this word)
Scandalous men? And whether does the Head of the Church Christ, in laying
Judgment to the Line, and Righteousness to the Plummet, use the Magistrates
Sword for a Spiritual and Supernatural end of the Service and Ministry of his
Church; or does he send Pastors and Teachers as his Ambassadors for this end?
But if you were not Disputing your self, and not Christ (say some) to make
Preachers the Alpha and Omega of men's Consciences, and the Circle which
begins and ends at it self, you would be satisfied, if Scandals be
punished by the Magistrate: Is not the Magistrate a Christian as you are? Paul
was glad that the Gospel was Preached, he made no account by whom. But I should
be grieved that such a hard conclusion should be drawn out of such innocent
Principles: This were to extract Blood out of Milk, a Domination out of a mere
Ministry; and I confess, Self is a great Sophist in Debates, and that any man
is inclinable to miscount himself, and to think he may stand for an hundred,
when the product is scarce one, if not a cipher. I conceive nothing is here
taught, that may reach a blow to the Honor and Majesty of the Godly
Magistrate. The Magistrate is a Christian as well as the Preacher; and in some
sense, so all the People were holy, as were Moses, Aaron and the Levites.
Uzziah who burned Incense was a Member of the Church of the Jews, and
Circumcised no less then the Sons of Aaron: Yet I hope these stretched
themselves beyond their line, when they usurped what was due to the Priests and
Levites. Its another thing to punish evil doing with the Sword, the Magistrate
is to do this. But there is a Spiritual removing of Scandals, by the saving of
the Spirit in the day of the Lord, 1 Cor. 5. 5. Matthew. 18. 15. 2 Cor. 10. 8.
and a gaining of the Soul of an Offender. This Spiritual removing of Scandals,
does only bring Christ and the Gospel in request, in the hearts of both such as
are within and without the Church; as Scandals raises up an evil report of
Christ and the Truth. Now the Sword can never this way remove Scandals; and
because Christ has appointed Spiritual means, and Spiritual Censures, to
restore the Lord Jesus to his Honor, 2 Cor. 2. It is presumption (with all
submission I speak it) for men to horse out, and decourt such Censures
Spiritual as the Apostles in the Spirit and Wisdom of Christ used as most
suitable to that end, and which the Lord commands in the second Command, and
to substitute in their room, nothing but a Sword void of all activity on the
Conscience.

I do also here plead for the perfection of the Word of God against Humane
Ceremonies, which are deservedly by the Honorable Houses of Parliament, and
Reverend Assembly laid aside; Religion needs not any such Ornaments, except
men would make the Worship of God, when naked, under shame, and so under sin
(for Justice Married shame and sin once.) But as Roses, Lillies, the Sun, and
other glorious Creatures, are most beautiful without Garments, and not capable
of shame; so is the Worship of God. I confess, Ceremonies were the Seas and
Rivers that Prelates delighted to swim in; and if their Element be dried up,
they have the less pleasure to live: But if they would repent of their bloody
Persecution, that their Souls might be saved, no matter. Ceremonies, as they
have nothing of Christ in them, so have they been injurious to Magistrates. It
is but a Ceremony that the Emperor kiss the sole of the Popes foot, because
there is indented on it a curious Crucifix. And when Prelacy was young, and its
beard not grown, a Deacon was sent to Theodosius the Emperor by the Prelates to
chide him, because he presumed to sit in the Chancel, a place too holy for
Laymen.

What I have here said against Erastus, a friend too dear to worthy Bullinger
and Rodolp. Gualther, (often we love both the Friend and his Error) I humbly
submit to the Judgment of the Godly and Learned: But I conceive, I am
unwilling that Error should lodge with me willingly; and I profess I am
afraid, that wrath is gone out from the Lord against the Rulers, if they shall
after a Reformation obtained with the Lives, Blood, Tears and Prayers of so
many of the Saints, whereof a great number are asleep in the Lord, rear up a
building to the Lord so maimed and lame, as Jesus Christ shall say, Offer it
now Mal. 1. 8.
to your Governor, will he be pleased with you, or accept your persons?

But it is a Controversy (say some) whether the Government of the Church of
the New Testament belong to the Magistrate or to the Church? to which I say; 1.
It was a Controversy created by men willing to please Princes, with more power
in the Courts of Christ, then ever the Lawgiver and Apostles gave them, and
that against the mind of glorious Lights, the first Reformers, and the whole
Troops of Protestant Divines, who Studied the Controversy against the usurped
Monarchy of the Man of sin, more exactly then one Physician, who in a cursory
way, diverted off his road of Medicine of which he wrote Learnedly, and broke
in on the By upon the deepest Polemicks of Divinity, and reached a Riders blow
unawares to his friends. 2. In things doubtful, Conscience has refuge to the
surest side: Now its granted by all, and not controverted by any, That in the
Apostolic Church, the Government of the Church of the New Testament was in the
hands of Apostles, Pastors, Teachers; and therefore Conscience would sway to
that in which there can be no Error, except on supposal of abuse; and Christian
Rulers would not do well to venture upon Eternity, Wrath, the Judgment to
come, confiding on the poor Plea of an Erastian Distinction, to incroach upon
the Prerogative Royal of Jesus Christ. This very God of Peace build Zion, and
make her an Habitation of Peace*

Yours in Jesus Christ, S. R.

Question 1.
The negative argument from Scripture valid. p 95 Not to command is to forbid.
p. 96 How far David's purpose to build the Temple was lawful. p. 97 Of additions
to the Word. p. 98 Even perfecting additions of men are unlawful. p. 99 Every
moral action is to be warranted by the Word. p. 102 What is man's, in worship,
is not lawful p. 103 Not all actions in man, as actions of mere nature, of arts
or trades of sciences, but only moral actions are regulated by Scripture. p 104
Helps of faith, and the formal object of faith are different. p 105 What
certitude of says is required in all our actions of our daily conversation. p.
107 The Scripture a Warrant for the morality of our acts, of the second Table.
p. 107 Many actions of the second Table are purely moral, all actions of the
first Table are purely moral. p. 107, 108 What ever is beside the Word of God,
in morals, is contrary to it. p. 109 The vanity of the perfection of Scriptures
in Essentials, not in Accidentals. p. 110 Whatsoever is not of faith, how true,
p. 110, 111 Doubting condemns. p 113 Papists say* the Scripture in general is
perfect, but not in particulars, and so Form lists. p 114 What is only
negative in Gods worship, cannot be commanded. ibid. Opinion of sanctity and
divine necessity, not essential to false-worship. ibid. The distinction of
worship, essential, and accidental, of Gods general and particular will, is to
be rejected. p. 118, 119 The distinction of divine and apostolic traditions
rejected. p. 125, 126 Circumstances not positive, religious observances, as
ceremonies are. p. 127 Ceremonies usurp essential properties of divine
Ordinances. p. 128, 129, 130 We owe subjection of conscience collateral only
to Gods Ordinances. p. 135 The spirit works not with Ceremonies. p. 136 The
place Matthew. 15. concerning the traditions of the Elders, discussed. p 137, 138
Ceremonies Magical. p. 141 If the third command shall enjoin decency in
general, then must it enjoin this special decency, Cross and Surplice. p. 141,
142 Jewish and Popish Ceremonies, are fruitless professions of unlawful
worship. p. 142, 143 Whether the Ceremonies be Idolatry. p 144 Of religious
kneeling. ibid. Four things in adoration. ibid. Intention of worship, not
essential to worship. p. 145 Religious bowing, of its nature, and not by man's
arbitrary and free intention, signifies divine adoration. p. 147, 148
Objections of Swarez contending, that intention of adoration is essential to
adoration, removed. p. 148, 149 Of the Idolatrous worship of the Jews and
Papists. p. 150 The relative expressio^ of God in the creature, is no ground of
adoring the creature, p. 151 The Jews believed not the Golden calt to be really
God. p. 151, 152 The adoring of Images not forbidden by the Ceremonial law, but
by the Moral law. p 154 The evasions of Bellarmine and Swarez answered. p. 155
Papists did of old adore before, or at the presence of the Image, as a
memorative sign and yet were Idolators. p. 158 Two sort of signs. ibid.
Diverse evasions of Papists touching the adoring of Images. p. 161, 162, scq.
Swarez is not content at the hungry expressions of Durandus, Mirandula, Hulcot,
in the worshipping of Images. p. 165, 166 The place ( worship at his footstool)
discussed, Psalm. 99, ibid. Prayer may as lawfully be given to the creature, as
Adoration. p. 169, 170 Diverse Fables touching Images. p. 179, 180 The original
of Images, p. 181 Images not in the ancient Church, neither worshippe^ therein,
p. 182, ^83, 184, etc. Vasquez will have all things to be adored. p. 190 Joan.
d^ Lugo proves the same by four Reasons. p. 191 Whether sitting or kneeling,
be the most convenient and lawful gesture, in the act of receiving the
Sacrament of Christ's Body and Blood. p. 192 Sitting the only convenient and
lawful gesture. p. 193 What is occasional in the first Supper. ibid. Christ
sat at the first Supper. p. 194, 195 Sitting a sign of our coheirship. p. 197,
198, 199 A sign of our coheirship may well consist with our inferiority in
worshipping Christ, p. 198 Ceremonies fail against the Authority of Rulers. p.
201 Whether humane Laws bind the conscience, or not. p. 201, 202, seq. How
civil positive Laws bind not the conscience: p. 202, 203 A twofold goodness.
p. 207 The will of created Authority cannot create goodness in things. p. 204,

commanded to hear, but not to ^ome to the Supper. p. 280 Whether Erastus does

The Introduction.
SECTION I. Certain Introductory Conclusions, tending to clear the perfection
of the Scriptures in all things, as well Ceremonial, as Non-Ceremoniall.
1. Conclusion.
CHrist Jesus has so far forth set down, and stablished Christ has not
instituted a mutable Church Government.
a perfect Plat-forme of Church Government in all Morals, not only both for the
inward, but also for the outward, and external Government of his House, that
he has left no Liberty or Latitude to Magistrates, or Churches whatsoever to
choose and settle such an orderly Form of Church Government or Discipline, as
is most suitable to their particular Civill-Government, Laws, Manners, and
Customs, so this Form be not repugnant to the Word of God.

I shall first explain the Terms of the Conclusion: 2. Confirm it: 3.
Vindicate it from the objections of Adversaries.

1. The Church Government of which I here speak, is a Church Government Some
things Moral, some things natural in Gods worship.
in its Morals: To exclude those things that are merely Physical and Humane in
this Government, as a Pulpit of this or that matter, Stone or Timber, or of
this Timber, or of any other kind; a Communion Table of this, or that form; a
Cup of wood, or of metal, as Silver, Tin, etc. It is a Moral thing, either
Morally good or evil, that there be an Officer in the Church that Christ has
not appointed, or that there be none but such as Christ has appointed: yet is
it not Moral that a Pastor be such or such a Country man, so he be apt to
teach, and holy; Crossing, signifying the dedication of the Baptized Child to
the service of Christ must be Moral, but what sort of River the ^^ter of
Baptism be, is merely Physical, not Moral.

So there be two sort of things in Gods Worship, things either Circumstances
either merely moral, or 2 merely Physical, or 3. mixed.
merely Moral, or merely Natural.

And here also we consider things Circumstantiall, as Time, Place, etc. And
circumstances are either merely Physical, or 2. merely Moral, or 3. mixed,
partly Moral, partly Physical; Circumstances merely Physical are such
adjuncts of divine worship, as are common and unseparable concomitants of both
civil, natural, and Religious or Sacred actions performed by men, and as they
are such, contribute no Moral goodness, or badnesse to the action or Agent in
the performance thereof, such as I take to be the seven individual proprieties
of every man; Forma, figura, locus, tempus strips, patria, nomen, under Form
and figure: The first two, I comprehend, such a proportion of body, a man of a
high stature, or low; a man beautiful, or not beautiful, to which I crave
leave to reduce all external Forms of habites, as clothes, the head covered,
or not covered, the situation of the body, as as they are in themselves, mere
Physical acts; kneeling, sitting, standing; the eyes cast down to the earth,
or lifted up; the hands lifted up, or not lifted up, the knocking on the
breast, or not knocking, motions of the soul, that are natural Time, Place,
Family, Country, Name, as such a person, Thomas, not John: the son of such a
man, not of such a man; 1. All these are common concomitants of Civil,
Natural, and Religious actions, for all actions performed by man of what kind
soever, as natural, to eat, sleep; or civil, to declaime an oration before
the people; or religious, to preach or pray, must be done by some persons, John
or Thomas, men of some Family, in some time, in some place, for they are not
actions eternal, and so must be done in time and place so* the Agents must,
have some habit, some gesture in the doing of all these actions, and they are
unseparable Adjuncts of all these actions because neither actions natural,
civil, nor Religious, can be performed, but by some persons, in some habit
and gesture, in some time, in some place: and lastly, they are mere
circumstantials, and contribute no Moral goodness or badnesse to the actions,
as they are but common and unseparable circumstances; for because he preaches
in time, or in place simply, the preaching is neither Morally good, nor ill,
better or worse, because Thomas prays in Gown or Cloak in this place, rather
then that place (so it be not, Locus ut sic, of intention, such a Religious
place, before the Image of Christ, or the Father, or the Virgin Mary) the
praying is neither the more, or the less acceptable to God because of these
common and unseparable adjuncts: Hence there can be no such force in these
circumstances, as to make the actions indifferent: Such as contend for the
lawfulness of Ceremonies, say our circumstances of time, place and the like,
is nothing but a meerblinde; for we cannot (say they) enumerate all these
circumstances, for habit, gesture, person, are not mere circumstances and they
mustcome in under the lap of this general, etc. or the like: To which I answer,
that to my knowledge all these that are mere Physical circumstances, are
particularly enumerated, such as are, 1. Time: 2. Place, 3. Person, or Agent:
4* Name. 5. Family: 6. Condition, as Country, Family, House: 7. Habits or
Garments: 8. Gestures, as sitting, standing, lifting of the eyes or hands, Our
Physic ^^ Circumstances are all easily known and numbered.
knocking on the breast, kneeling, and there is no blind in this enumeration,
for there be no other particulars that can be enumerated, except this time of
the day, eight or ten of clock, this place, not any other, this person not
another, and these are only considered here as circumstances, not as such and
such circumstances, but the truth is, the enumeration of Symbolicall Rites, as
Cross, Surplice, and the like, is really a blind, and is an enumeration with
a wide belly, and includes species, and not individuals only, as Symbolicall
Ceremonies, such as are Crossing, Bells, Oil, Salt, Spettle, Milk, turning to
the East, toward the people, from the people, toward the Altar, with a high
voice, with a low voice, and a thousand the like; yea, all the old Ceremonies
of Moses with a new face, all the toys of the Mass, of the Dedication of
Churches, which would fill a Volumne like the Rationale of Durandus: 2. Some
Circumstances are merely Moral, for as Divines distinguish Time and Place; in
Time as Time, and as such a Religious Time, the Lords Sabbath, Tempus, and
tempus ut sic, and Place as Place, or such a Religious place, Locus, and locus
ut sic* Circumstances, and such and such circumstances
So we may distinguish here, between circumstances in common or in gross, and
such and such circumstances; As time is a common adjunct of Divine Worship: But
such a time, to wit, the Lordsday, is both the time of Worship, and Worship it
self. So there is place of Worship, and there is such a Religious place, The
holy of holiest, the Temple. A habit is a mere accident of Worship, the person,
John or Thomas, is also an accident; but if God command such an Ephod as Aaron
and the Priests were to wear, this is not a mere circumstance; that the person
who administreth the Lord's Supper, be John or Thomas, is a mere circumstance;
but that this person be a called Pastor, not a private man, is more then a
circumstance. And therefore these circumstances, taken in common and their
Universal nature, are merely Physical circumstances; but taken in their
particular and determinate restrictions, as such circumstances, they may be
merely Moral circumstances, such as are the common adjunct of the time of
Worship, the place, and the Sabbath time and the Temple for Jewish Worship. The
former are circumstances merely Physical, the latter merely Moral; I mean, as
they are restricted other ways: The Temple of Jerusalem served as our meeting
places do, to sense off the injuries of Heaven and Sun; but that is as a place,
not as such a place.

3. There be some mixed circumstances, as these same Physical circumstances,
clothed with their own seasonable conveniences; so time for Worship, and due
and convenient time is required, there may be some Scandalous and Superstitious
time for Worship. A habit in the Preacher is required, and that a grave one; a
place is required for private Worship, and a fit place, such as is not the
Market-street for private Praying; the inconveniency of the circumstance may
vitiate the Worship.

I did say that Christ Jesus has set down in the Word, a perfect Platform of
Church Government, in all Morals; I say in all Morals, The Scripture teaches
not mere circumstances, but supposes them.
because the Word does not teach us any thing of circumstances, Physical as
Physical. Scriptura talia non ponit, sed supponit: The Scripture says not,
That the Worship of God must have a time, a place, when, and where its to be
performed, a person, who is to perform it, a habit, or garments on the person
that Worshippeth; the Scripture teaches none of these, but supposes that they
are and must be; because nature teaches, that without time, place, person,
habit, gesture, its unpossible that these or any humane actions can be; and
therefore Prelaticall Formalists, do without all sense or reason, require that
we should prove by Scripture, the lawfulness of time, place, person, habit,
gesture in Gods Worship; for these are presupposed in all actions, Natural,
Civil, Religious, Private, Public, Lawful, unlawful, in acts of Arts,
Sciences, of Moral conversing and all; yea, there is as good reason, that they
demand Scripture to prove he must be a living man, who has a reasonable soul,
and senses, and is born of a woman, who Preaches and Administrateth
Sacraments, which is presupposed by nature.

When the Heretic wills me to prove from Scripture that Christ is very man;
it is a vain thing he should demand of me beside to prove by Scripture, that
Christ is such a one also as can laugh, weep, admire, sing, sigh, etc. for
these are presupposed to follow man's nature; and if Scripture prove Christ to
be a true man, it presupposes by natures light, that he can laugh, he can
weep, and that in some time, some place, in some habit, in some gesture, so he
be a man; for that is presupposed by the light of nature, and known by the most
Barbarous who never heard of Scripture; and therefore there is no greater
reason to put us to prove all the natural and unseparable circumstances of
Worship, such as time and place, without which it is impossible any action at
all can be performed; then that we should press Prelates to prove by Scripture,
that James Usher is born of English or Irish Parents, for sense and nature can
prove all these without Scripture: But because their Ceremonies of Crossing,
bowing to Altars, Festival days, Oil, Salt, Spittle, Mass* clothes, are
nothing warrantable by natures light, and must have Moral and Symbolicall
influence in Worship, as positive Religious observances, having some spiritual
signification and use, (except they be reasonlesse fancies) we have just reason
to demand a warrant and special Charter for all Morals, and so for their
Ceremonies in the Scripture, and to call their etc. humane Ceremonies and the
like, a blind: For if Prelates can prove these Ceremonies to be from Christ, and
warranted by his Testament, we shall yield that their natural circumstances of
time, when you should Bow to Altars, and Cross a Baptized Infant, and where,
or in what place you should wear Surplice; and that the person that uses Oil,
Spittle, Salt, in Baptism, must do it in some habit, and with some gesture,
either sitting, standing, lying, or kneeling, are all warrantable and lawful
from the light of nature; for if Gods light of Scripture, warrant wearing of a
Surplice, as it does warrant Sacramental eating and drinking, the light of
nature must warrant these concreated, natural, and unseparable circumstances
of time, place, person, habit, gesture used in both the former and the latter.

But because I said that circumstances of time and place have a Time and place
of Ceremonies need not be proved.
threefold consideration, Physical, Moral, and Mixed: and I have spoken only
of these circumstances in a Physical or natural consideration; therefore in
the other two considerations there being involved some Moral goodness, and
because there is no Moral goodness imaginable, but it must have its
essential form and being from a Law or word of God; therefore all the former
circumstances, as they are clothed with either moral convenience and
expediency, or with some Religious positive goodness, must be warranted by the
Word of God, or the Rules of sinlesse and spiritual Prudence, which cannot
deviate from the word of God: For circumstances clothed with Religious Positive
goodness, such as are the Sabbath day, the holy of Holiest, the Temple; these
are not mere circumstances, but worship it self: So a Religious habit, as an
Ephod or a Surplice, is not a mere circumstance, or a mere habit, but a
worship, or such a part or limb of worship as must be warranted by the word of
truth, else it is nothing but a will-device, and a forgery, and so to be
rejected. And as touching things of Prudence, they are things properly mixed, as
at what hour Sermon shall begin in such a Church, at eight, or nine, or ten of
the clock; how the worship shall be ordered, whether you should begin the
Worship with a word of Prayer, or a word of Praising, or a word of Exhorting to
stir up for the duty of the day, is a matter of Prudence; and because God has
not laid the band of a Precept on us, to begin with either of the three;
therefore it would seem, that though the things themselves be Moral, and must
be warranted by a Word of God; yet the order is not Moral, but Prudentiall,
and so cannot fall under a command of the Church; for to me it is hard, that
men and the Church should lay on a tie or bond of a Precept where God has laid
on no such bond; The Church, in these mixed things, where the Morality is not
clear, at farthest, can but go on to directive advises, as Paul does, 1 Cor. 7.
6. 12. Not to imposing of Laws, nor to injunctions or Commandments under the
pain of Church Censures; for Christ must bind and ratify in Heaven, all
Church Censures on earth, and so the Church cannot command nor censure, but as
Christ himself would command or censure.

Now because the rest of the conclusion shall be farther cleared; I prove that
Christ has so far forth set down a perfect Platform of Church Government in
the Scripture, as he has not given a liberty to Rulers, Prelates, or to the
Church her self, to set up a variable Platform suitable to their particular
Civil Government, Laws, Manners and Customs.

1 Arg. What ever makes the man of God perfect, thoroughly furnished 1. Argum.
to prove that the Platform of Church Government, is not mutable at men's will.
unto all good works, and is written for this end, that any Timothy or
Faithful Pastor, might know how he ought to behave himself in the House of
God. That must make the man of God perfect in this good work, of holy walking,
as a perfect Governor, or a perfect Churchmember, to be governed in all
Moral acts of Discipline and godly behavior, according to the spiritual
policy of the Lords house, and so must hold forth a perfect Platform of
Discipline, which does not vary, ebb and flow, and alter according to the
Civil Government, Laws, Manners and Customs of men: But the Scriptures of God
does so instruct all Members of the visible Church, both Governors and
governed, 2 Timothy 3. 16, 17. 1 Timothy 3. 14, 15. Ergo, the Scripture must hold
forth a perfect form of Discipline which does not vary, ebb, flow, and alter
according to the Civil Governments, Laws, Manners and Customs of men. The
Proposition is made good: Because, 1. to walk according to the spiritual
Policy of the Lords house, must be a good work, and so a Moral and Lawful
work, and a due conversing in the spiritual Society of the Church, according
to the Rule of the Word. 2. If this Moral walking be according to a Rule that
may crook, bow and vary according as Civil Customs of men and Cities alter
and vary at men's pleasure, It is a Moral walking, no more according to the
Rule of Scripture, then the contradic^nt thereof is according to this Rule, but
falls and rises, has its ups and downs at the mere nod and pleasure of men,
who may change Customs and Manners every year twice, if so it please them. For
what Scripture teaches me a Civil Custom of a City, as not to carry Armor
in the night, to take up the Names of all between sixteen years of age and
sixty? Or what Scripture teaches me, a Bishop may be above the Pastors of the
Church, or a Bishop may not be? Surplice, Crossing, Bowing and Cringing to
wooden Altars, may be or may not be? Deacons may be, or may not be? even as
customs and guises of the Civil State, appear as Meteors in the Air, and in
the fourth part of a night, disappear and vanish to nothing; to say, that the
word teaches the Church to abstain from blood, is a part of the Act. 15.
perfection of the Scripture, and yet the Scripture teaches that abstinence
from blood, not as an eternal, and unalterable Law, for we are not now tied to
abstain from blood, therefore the Scripture may make the man of God perfect in
some works that are alterable The Scriptures way of teaching that indifferent
things are alterable, is it self unalterable.
and changeable: This (I say) is no Answer, for saying that God should now make
abstinence from blood, and things strangled, indifferent, as he made them in
that intervall of time, Acts 15. When the Ceremonies were mortal, but not
deadly and unlawful, as is clear in that Paul, Act. 16. 1, 2, 3. circumcised
Timothy, that Rite being then indifferent; and yet he writes in another case,
when the Gospel is now fully promulgated, that to be circumcised makes a man a
debtor in conscience, to keep the whole Law of Moses, and so to abstain from
eating of blood, and things strangled, must be a falling from the Grace of
Christ, and an Apostasy from the Gospel, Gal. 5* 1, 2, 3. 4, 5, 6* 7. The like
I say of observing of days, which, Romans 14. 5, 6. were indifferent, and in
another case, Gal. 4. 9, 10. Col. 2. 16, 17. Deadly, unlawful, and not
necessary, so the matter, Acts 15. which in the case of scandilizing the weak,
is abstinence from things indifferent, say that they are indifferent, binds
as a perpetual Law to the end of the world, and binds us this same very day,
Romans 14. 20. In the Morality of it, as abstinence from murdering, One for whom
Christ died, Romans 14. 15. 1 Cor. 8. 12, 13. 1 Cor. 10. 26, 27, 28. And upon the
ground laid by Prelates, which is most false and untrue, to wit, that many
Positive things in Church Government, such as are Prelates deemed to be
warranted by Apostolic, though not by Divine right: Ceremonies, and Crossing,
kneeling to bread, Altars, Surplice, Rochet, corner-Cap, yea, and Circumcision,
a Passeover-Lambe, and all the Jewish Ceremonies, though with another spirit
and intention, then to shadow forth Christ to come in the flesh, imagined to be
indifferent, and alterable things, we hold that all these are to be abstained
from, as eating of blood, and things strangled of old were, if you say they are
as indifferent, as blood, and some meats were in the case, Act. 15. Romans 14. 1
Cor. 8. 1 Cor. 10. Its a most false principle as we shall hear, and therefore
the Scripture, if it make the man of God perfect to every good work, as the
Apostle says, it must teach us to abstain from all these as scandalous, and
must set down as perfect and particular directions for Church Government, as
Paul does, Romans 14. Set down a particular Platform, how we shall eschew
Murder; for scandalizing our Brethren in the use of things indifferent, is
spiritual Murder, Romans 14. 15. 20.

Customs and Manners of the people, we shall not so be guided in our path, as
our feet shall not stumble; the Church might then suffer Jezabell to Prophecy,
and these that has the Doctrine of Balaam, or not suffer them, as the Civil
Laws, and alterable Customs of the people should require: Now the Scriptures
does clearly insinuate, that the Law and will of God revealed in the Word, is a
Rule of walking straightly and of declining sin, and any stumbling in our way,
which deserves a rebuke and a threatening, such as Christ utters against the
Church of Pergamos, Rev. 2. 14, 15, 16. And of Thyatira, v. 17, 18. Now if
these Churches had no certain Rule or Word of God, from which they should
deviate and err in their path of Discipline, but the Customs and alterable
Civil Laws and Manners of men, they were unjustly rebuked by Christ, which to
aver were Blasphemy.

Prelates say, Some things in Church-Policie, are Fundamentals, not to be
altered; but there be other things alterable. And of things of Policy of the
former notion, we have a certain Platform in Scripture; but of the latter, not
any at all is necessary; and the not suffering of false Teachers in the Church,
is of the former sort. But I Answer, some Scripture or reason ought to be given
of this distinction: If all be Moral and unalterable that are necessary to
Salvation, its good* But to suppress Jezabell and false teachers, is not
necessary, Necessitate medii; for then the Salvation of that Church were
desperate, and past remedy, which should suffer false teachers; surely then

no reason why some things Positive of Church-Policie are alterable, some not.
Damnation, as are these who are void of all Faith and knowledge of
Fundamental Articles; I conceive Prelates will hold their hand, and not be so
rash as to say this; If these other things of Policy be necessary, necessitate
precepti, in regard that Jesus Christ has commanded them to be observed, why
then are some things alterable which Christ has commanded to be observed some
things unalterable? Cross and Surplice, which Prelates say have been in the
Church these twelve hundred years, are in themselves as positive, and have as
small affinity with the Civil Laws, Customs and Manners of Nations (except
they mean sinful Customs) as Sacramental eating and drinking. And the like
may be said of all the alterable Ceremonies sometimes in use, in England, and
now in force amongst Papists.

spot unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ 1 Timothy 6. 13.
is no alterable command that falls and rises with the Customs, Civil Laws
and Manners of men. But Paul commands under that, every Positive Law of
Church Discipline to be thus kept, of which he speaks in these Epistles to
Timothy.

Mr. Hooker denies the assumption; For Paul (says he) restrains 3. Book,
Eccles. Polic, page 117, 118. The place, 1 Timothy, 6. 13. discussed.
the words to one special Commandment amongst many; and therefore it is not
said, keep the Ordinances, Laws, Constitutions, which thou have received; but
(...), that great Commandment, which does principally concern thee and thy
calling, that Commandment that Christ did so often inculcate unto Peter (Feed
my sheep) and that Act. 20. Attend to your selves and all the flock, etc. And
that, 2 Timothy 4. 1. I charge thee in the sight of God, etc. Preach the word, and
teach the Gospel without mixture, etc. And these words (till the appearance of
Christ) does not import the time wherein it should be kept; but rather the time
whereunto the final reward for keeping it was reserved according to that,
henceforth is laid up for me a crown of Righteousness. It does not import
perpetual observation of the Apostles Commandment, for it binds not to the
Precept of choosing of Widows, as the Adversaries grant. We do not deny, but
certain things were Commanded to be, though Positive, yet perpetual in the
Church. Ans. 1. If Paul restrain this to one special Commandment, sure it is
so general and comprehensive a Commandment of feeding the Flock, as takes in
all the special Positive Commandments belonging to feeding, by both Word and
Discipline, which is enough for the perpetuity of all Positive precepts of
Discipline and Policy, even till Christ's appearance to judge the world; and I
wonder that Hooker expounds this by 2. Tim. 4. 1. As if Paul did mean the
precept of Preaching only, and that soundly and without mixture; and yet pass
by the Parallel place, 1 Timothy 5 21. A^lmostin the same style of Language, in
which place he speaks of many special Positive precepts and Rules of
Policy, as of poor widows, the Alms to be given to them; the not rebuking of
an Elder, the office of Elders Governing, and of Elders laboring in the Word
and Doctrine, the not receiving an accusation against an Elder, but under two
or three Witnesses, the public rebuking of those who offend publicly, the not
admitting to the Ministry raw and green soldiers not tried, and many other
particulars of Policy, of all which he says gravely, v. 21. I charge thee
before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Elect Angels, that thou observe
these things etc. Certainly, (...), these things was not one Commandment, but
all the precepts of Faith, and of Church Government spoken of in this Epistle;
and truly ^ shall think that Paul who particular^z^th that Timothy should not
drink water, but a little wine because of his infirmity, and of bringing with
him the cloak that he left at Troas, and the Paul's cloak of less consequence,
then Positives of policy.
parchments, 2 Timothy 4 does far more spec^fi^ all the positives of policy, and
writ, how all the Timothies and Pastors are to behave themselves in the Church
of God: If Ceremonies and all these alterable trifles had not been excluded out
of the Platform; for a Religious Masse-Surplice, is of far more consequence
then Paul's old cloak, and yet Paul spoke of the one in Canonick-Scripture,
never of the other; and Oil, Spittle, Salt, Cross in Baptism being positive
significant Rites, and having continued in the Church so many hundred years,
should far rather have been specified in Scripture then Timothies drinking of
water: yea, and if all the alterable positive things of Policy, as Cross,
Surplice, be commanded as necessary in the general, though not in this or that
particular, as Hooker and other Formalists do teach, then sure the meaning must
be: I give to thee, O Timothy, charge in the sight of God who quickens all
things, and before Christ Jesus, etc. That thou* keep this Commandment of
Crossing, Surplice, bowing to Altars, of corner-Cap, or of the equivalent of
these, without spot irrebukeable to the appearance of Jesus Christ; for the
precept of feeding the Flock, must include all these; and though Ceremonies in
particular be alterable, and not commanded in Hythothesie; yet that in general
there should be such positive Ceremonies is necessary, and the Apostle (say
they) commands them, 1 Cor. 14. 40. Yea, (as Dunam says) humane Holidays,
are commanded in the fourth Commandment, and Burges says, all the Ceremonies
are commanded in the third Commandment, and Formalists; who denied the Prelate
to be of Divine institution, made a Ceremony of him, and made him a decent and
orderly thing; which as the Poet said, to me is like the act of death, that
brought Great Alexander, to whom the whole world was not sufficient, in small
bounds, in the Grave under two foot of earth, and this makes the great Pope,
the Catholic Bishop of the earth a little Ceremony: But this little Ceremony
has these many hundred years infested the whole earth. 2. If this precept be
not a perpetual binding precept till Christ's second appearance, but only
rewarded with life eternal at Christ's appearance, yet shall it follow that all
things included in the precept of feeding the flock, and so all the Surplice,
Crossing, Will Worship or their equivalent, without which, feeding cannot be in
a decent and orderly way (as they say from, 1 Cor. 14. 40.) must be rewarded
with life eternal: let Formalists wait at the day of judgment for a reward,
of a Garment of glory for wearing a linning Surplice, my faith cannot reach it.

3. For the choosing of Widovves that are poor to take care of the poor and
sick in Hospitals; we think it just as necessary now as then, though no ways,
if there be none sick, and poor in the Church: But that Widows were
Church Officers ordained, as were Deacons, Act. 6. 6. we never thought, and
therefore we do not see that the wanting of such Widows, is the want of a
Positive institution of Church-Policy; for other positive things of policy that
should be of perpetual use, and not all of the same kind, and of equal
necessity: I see no reason (which I speak for Apostles) which were necessary
then, and not now; But if from thence Formalists infer, that many positive
things of policy are alterable, I can infer with equal strength of reason,
that then Pastors, and Teachers are alterable by the Church, for if the one
have a Divine institution to warrant it, Ephesians. 4. 11, 12, 13. so has the other;
and if Prelates may come themselves into the Church without any warrant but
this, that Apostles are alterable, and may put out Pastors and Teachers,
because God has put out Apostles; we have a new world of alterable
Church-Policy. 5. Reverent Beza refers the Commandment to the Platform of
Discipline: So Ambrose in Loc. and Chrysostom Homil. 18. so Diodat. This
Commandment which is, ver. 11, 12. Or generally all other Commandments, which
are contained in this Epistle; Popish Writers confess the same, though to the
disadvantage of their Cause, who maintain unwritten Church-Policy and
Ceremonies: So Lyra and Nicol. Gorran. Mandatum quod Deus, and ego mandavimus,
the Commandment of the Lord, and of me his Apostle, Corne^a lapide: Quicquid
tibi, O Episcope, hac Epistola prescripsi, and demandavi, hoc serva: Salmeron,
alii per mandatum intelligunt, Quecunque mandavi spectantia ad munus boni
Episcopi.

SECT. II.
THE Adversaries amongst these things of Church-Policy, do Bilson of perpetual
Gover. c. 3. Hooker of Eccles. Polic. l. 3.
reckon such things as concern the outward man, and externals only; and
therefore Bilson, Hooker and the rest, as Cameron and others, will have Christ's
kingdom altogether Spiritual, Mystical, and invisible, and Christ to them is
not a King to bind the external man, nor does he as King take care of the
external government of his own house, that belongs (say they) as other
external things to the Civil Magistrate, who with advise and counsel of the
Church, Bishops and their unhallowed Members, may make Laws in all externals,
for the Government of the Church, and all these externals though Positive, are
alterable; yea, and added to the word, though not as additions corrupting, but
as perfecting and adorning the word of God and his worship.

In opposition to this, our fourth Argument shall be, he who is 4. Arg. Christ
the Head of hi^ Church i^ the external poli^y thereof.
the only Head, Lord, and King of his Church, must govern the politic,
external body his Church, perfectly by Laws of his own spiritual policy, and
that more perfectly then any earthly Monarch, or State does their subjects, or
any Commanders, or any Lord or Master of Family, does their Army, Soldiers,
and members of their Family.

But Christ is the head and only head of the Church, for by what title Christ
is before all things, he in whom all things consist, and is the beginning, the
first borne fram the dead, and has the pre-eminence in all things; and he is
only, so^ely and absolutely all these, by the same title he is the Head, and
so the only Head of the Body the Church, Col. 1. 17, 18. And he is the head of
his Politic body, and so a head in all externals, as well as of mystical and
inv^sible body, for if his Church be an external Political body, and ruled by
Organs, Eyes, Watchmen, Rulers, Feeders, and such as externally guides the
flock, as it is, Ephesians. 4* 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. 1 Cor. 12. 28. Matthew. 16* 17,
18. A society to which Christ has given the keys of his House, and so
external power in a visible Politic Court on earth to bind and loose, to
take in and put out, to open and shut the doors of his visible Politic house;
then this Politic body must have a head in external policy, and this head in
externals must as a head govern by Laws all the members in their external
society; for a body without a head is a monster, and a Politic body, without a
head Politic, and one that rules Politically, is a Monster. And Christ is the
King, yea the only King of his own Kingdom, either as this Kingdom is mystical
and invisible, or as it is Politic, external, and visible on earth, as these
Scriptures proves, 1. Mat. 28. 18. Jesus ^aith unto me, is all power given in
Heaven and in earth: I hope this power is only given to Christ, not to Pope or
earthly Prince: It is the name above all names, Phil. 2. 9. King of Kings* Rev.
17. 14. And upon this Kingly power, Christ does an ex^ernall Act of Royal
power, and gives not only an inward but also a Political, external power to
his disciples, ver. ^9. Go Teach, and Baptize all Nations: Is this only inward
and heart-^eaching, and inward Baptizing by the spirit? I think not, God has
reserved that to himself only, Isa. 54. 13. Ioh. 6 44. 45. Joh. 1. 33. and Ioh.
20, 21. 22. Upon this that the Father sent Christ, and so set him his King upon
his holy hill of Zion, Psa. 2. 6. Christ performs an external Politic
mission, and sends his disciples with power in a Politic external way to
remit and retain sins, in an external way, for there is clearly two remittings
and retainings of sins in the Text: None can say of the Church, its my Church,
but he who is King of the Church; and Christ says, Matthew, 16. 18. that it is
his Church, and upon this it is his Kingdom, and the keys are his keys, and
they are keys of a Kingdom visible and Politic on earth, as is evident, ver.
19. I will give unto thee, the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatsoever
thou shall bind on earth, (in an external Political court of Church Rulers,
as it is differenced from an internal, and mystical binding in Heaven) shall
be bound in Heaven, etc. For it is clear that there is an internal binding in
Heaven, and a Political and external binding on earth, and both are done by
the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven: But Christ can have or give no Political or
ex^ernall keys of an external and Political King, but as he is a King: Yea,
and Excommunication does not only bind the inward man in Heaven, but also the
external man on earth, excluding him from the Society of the Church as a
Heathen, and a Publican, and purging him out from the external communion of
the Church, as if he were now no brother, Matthew. 18. ^7* 18. 1 Cor. 5. 7. 10,
11, 12. Now this external separating and judging of an offender by the Church
is done by the keys of the Kingdom; Ergo, by Christ as a King, ruling the
external man Politically, and so by the key of the house of David, which is
laid upon Christ's shoulder, Isa. 22. 22. And by a Royal Act of him, upon whose
shoulder is the Government, Is* 9 6. Who sits upon the throne of David to
order the kingdom, and to establish it with judgment and justice. For the
Church does bind and loose in the external Court, either by a Commission from
him who as head of the Church, and who as King gave to her the Keys of the
Kingdom; or by a general Arbitrary power given to the Magistrate and Church,
to do in these things as they please; so they do nothing contrary to the Word,
though not according to the Word, as they are to do in Doctrinals; if the
former be said, then must the external Government be upon the shoulder of
Christ as King, which is that which we teach: If the latter be said, then might
the Magistrate and Church appoint such an Ordinance as excommunication, and so
they may by their Artitrary A promise of Pardoning of sin made to the right use
of the keys proves discipline to be a part of the Gospel.
power, make a Gospel Promise of ratifying an Ordinance in heaven, and of
pardoning sins in heaven; for he that can make the ordinance, can make also the
Gospel-Promise, and he that can by an Arbitrary power make one Promise or part
of the Gospel, may make all. And if either Magistrate or Church can appoint
such an Ordinance as has a Promise of b^nding and loosing made good in heaven,
they may also take away such Ordinances and Gospel Promises; for it is the same
power to make and add, to unmake and destroy Ordinances. Hence also I argue
for the Immutabili^y of a Scripturall Platform, that the Church cannot alter at
her will: thus, That must be of Divine institution which is an essential part
of the Gospel; but the Platform of Church Government in the word is such, and
so must be no less Immutable then the Gospel. I make good the major
Proposition thus: That which essentially includes a Promise of the New
Testament, that must be a part of the Gospel which consists especially of
Promises, Heb. 8. 6. 2 Cor. 7. 1. Gal. 3. 17. Gal. 4. 23, 24. But there is a
Promise of forgiving sins in Heaven made to the Church, using the Keys aright,
and of Christ's presence in the exercise of the Keys, as walking amongst the
golden Candlesticks, Matthew. 18. 18, 19. 20. Math. 16. 18, 19. Job. 20. 23. Rev.
2. 1. Now if any shall object, this Argument proves only that which is not
denied, to wit, that some part of Discipline only, is of Divine institution
which is not denied, for a power of binding and loosing, of remitting and
retaining sins, is of Divine institution: But hence it is not concluded that
the whole Platform, and all the limbs, joints, bones, and toes are of Divine
institution, they being matters of smaller concernment. I Answer, As from a
part of the Doctrine of the Law and Gospel that is of Divine institution; for
Example, that I keep, observe and do the Law, that I believe and repent, which
are things of Divine institution: I infer that the whole Platform of Law and
Gospel, is of Divine institution, and the particulars of Obedience and Faith,
are not Arbitrary to the Church; just so in Discipline, I say the like, there
is no more reason for one part written by God, then for another.

Farther, if the Church be a visible Politic Kingdom, as it is, Mat. 13. v.
45, 46, 47, 48. Matthew. 16. 19. Matthew. 8. 12. And if the Word be the Word,
Scepter and Law of the Kingdom, as it is, Matthew. 6. 10. Matthew. 13. 11. Luke 4.
43. Matthew. 4. 23. Mark 13. 8. Luke 21. 10. 14. Luke 8. 10. Yea, the Sword and
Royal power of the King, Rev. 1. 16. Rev. 19. 15. By which he Rules and
Reigns in his Church, Isa. 11. v. 4. Psalm. 110. 2. Heb. 1. 8, 9. Psalm. 45. 3,
4. 5, 6, 7. Isa. 61. 1, 2. 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5, 6. 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5, 6, 7. And if by
this Word the King Reigns, binds, loses, and conquereth souls and
subdueth his Enemies, Matthew. 18. 18, 19, 20. Matthew. 16. 19. Rev. 6. 2. Then
certainly Christ must Reign Politically, and externally in his Church, and walk
in the midst of the golden Candlesticks, Rev. 2. 1. And if Christ Ascending to
Heaven as a Victorious King, Leading Captivity Captive, gave gifts to men, and
appointed an external policy, for the gathering of his Saints by the
Ministry of certain officers of his Kingdom, as it is, Psalm. 68. 18. Even that
the Lord God might dwell amongst them, Ephesians. 4. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Then he
must Reign in the external Policy of Pastors, Teachers, Elders, by Word,
Sacraments, and Discipline. Now the King himself, the Lord who Reigns in this
external Policy, must be the only Lawgiver, Iam. 4. 12. Isa. 33. v. 22. There
can be no Rabbis or Doctors on earth, who as little Kings can make Laws under
him, Mat. 23. v. 8, 9, 10. Yea, not Apostles who can teach how the Worship
should externally be ordered, but what they receive of the King of the Church,
1 Cor. 11. 23. Act. 15. v. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. How the house should be
Governed, Heb. 3. 1, 2. 4, 5. Yea, nothing more reasonable, then that
Whatsoever is commanded by the God of Heaven, should be done in, and for the
house of the God of Heaven, under the pain of his Wrath, Ezr. 7. 23. 1. That
there should be Officers in a Kingdom, and Laws to Govern the Subjects, beside
the will of the Prince or Judges of the Land, or that the Members of a Family,
or Soldiers in an Army should be Governed by any Rule, Custom, or Law, beside
or without the will of the Master of the House, and of the General and
Commanders, is all one, as if Subjects, Families and Soldiers, should be Ruled
and Governed by their own will and wisdom, and not by their King, Judges,
Masters and Commanders; for the question is upon this undeniable The will of
Christ as King, is the Rule of the Government of his house.
supposition, that Christ is the only Head and King of his Church, and so the
Head and King of Prelates (if they be of the body) and of the Rulers, Guides,
and Pastors of the Church, which are to be Governed and Ruled by certain Laws,
no less then the people, whither or no this Representative Church of Rulers,
being Subjects and Members of the Head and King of the Church, are to be Ruled
by the wisdom, Laws, and Commandments of this King the Lord Jesus; or if they
have granted to them a vast Arbitrary power to Govern both themselves and the
people, by adding Positive Mandats of Arbitrary Commanders, such as Prelates are
(in the mind of those who think they have no patent of any Divine right) and
of Surplice, Crossing, kneeling for reverence to wood, to bread and wine. The
matter cannot be helped, by saying that Christ is the Mystical, Invisible
King, (some doubt if he be the only King of the Church, which is too gross to
be resuted) of the Church in things spiritual, and in regard of the inward
operation of the Spirit; but he is not a Political and visible Head in regard
of external Policy; this distinction must hold also in regard of the people,
who as Christians and believers are rather under Christ as a Mystical and
invisible Head, then the Rulers who are not as Rulers, but only in so far as
they are believers, Mystical Members of the Head Christ; for Christ exercises
no Mystical and Internal operations of saving Grace upon Rulers as Rulers;
but upon Rulers as believers, then he cannot be the Mystical and invisible
King of Rulers as Rulers, to give them as a King, an Arbitrary power to be
little Kings under him, to Govern as they please; and the truth is, Christ is a
Political Head and King of his Church, not properly a visible Head, 2 Cor. 5.
16. Except that he is a visible Head in this sense, in that he Reigns and
Rules, even in the external visible Policy of his Church, through all the
Catholic visible Church, in his Officers, Lawful Synods, Ordinances, giving
them Laws in all Positive externals, which place the Beast, the King of the
Bottomless Pit, the Pope usurpeth: But I would gladly be informed of
Formalists, how the King is the Head and Vicegerent of Christ over the Church;
if Christ's Kingdom be only spiritual, Mystical Internal, not Political, not
external; for sure the King as King, exercises no internal and Mystical
operations upon the consciences of men under Jesus Christ, his power is only
Political and Civilly Political, about, or without the Church, not properly
within the Church: Surely if Rulers be Subjects and Members under Christ the
Head and King: I shall believe that Christ must in all Positive things of
external Policy, give to them Particular Laws in the Scripture, and Rule
them; and that they being Members, not the Head, must as particularly be Ruled
in all externals Positive, by the will and Law of the Head Christ, and that
they are not Kings, Heads and Law givers, and Rulers to themselves: And
especially upon these considerations. This King and Head must be particular in
an immutable, perpetual, and unalterable Platform of Church Government. 1.

Policy of his house to the admiration of the Queen of Sheba, in this we
conceive was a type of a greater then Solomon. 2. The Positives of the policy
of Christ's house, must be congruous to a supernatural end, the edification of
souls, and that Symbolicall Rites of men's devising, speak supernatural duties,
that Christ has already spoken in the Scripture, as that Crossing spell out
Dedication to Christ's Service, Surplice, pastoral holiness, which both are
Gospel truths, 1. Pet. 1. 18. 1 Pet. 2. 24. Isa. 52. 11. Is as supernatural a
mean for edification, as that bread and wine signify Christ's body and blood;
and therefore the one more then the other ought not to be left to humane
reason, but must be expressly set down in Scripture. 3. All these must lay a tie
upon the conscience; but if they have their rise from the vain will of Prelates
and men, they can never bind my conscience; for how can they bind my conscience
as the Scripture binds them on me, and yet Rulers as Rulers in the name of
Christ the King, cannot press them upon me? Formalists give diverse Replies to
this: As, 1. Hooker: You are Hooker, Eccles. Policy, l. 3. 123, 124.
constrained to say that of many things of Church-Policie, some are of great
weight, some of less, that what has been urged of immutability of Laws, it
extends in truth no farther then only to Laws, wherein things of greater
moment are prescribed; as Pastors, Lay Elders, Deacons, Synods, Widows; else
come to particulars, and show if all yours be perpetual, and our particulars
unlawful. Ans. 1. Things of greater and less weight, we acknowledge in
Church-Policie, and in Doctrinals too; but in this sense only: 1. That they be
things Positive. 2. They be both things that are unchangeable by any, except by
God himself, and oblige us Necessitate precepti, by the necessity of a Divine
Commandment, as Matthew. 23. 23. To pay tithe of Mint, Annise, and Cummin, is a
less matter then the weightier Things of Policy, because less weighty then
the greater things of the Law, are not therefore mutable at the pleasure of men.
duties of the Law, Judgment, Mercy, and Faith: But there is nothing so small
in either Doctrinals or Policy, so as men may alter, omit, and leave off these
smallest Positive things that God has commanded; for Christ says, Paying of
tithe of Mint, ought not to be omitted, though the Church of Pharisees should
neglect it, and command some other petty small things in place thereof: If
therefore Prelates should obliterate the Office of Ruling Elders which Christ
the Lord instituted in his Church, and put themselves in as Governors in their
Room, they may put out Pastors and Sacraments, and take in for them, Turkish
Priests, and Circumcision, with a signification that Christ is already come in
the flesh: We urge the immutability of Christ's Laws, as well in the smallest as
greatest things, though the Commandments of Christ be greater or less in
regard of the intrinsecall matter, as to use water in Baptism, or to Baptize
is less then to Preach Christ, and believe in him, 1 Cor. 1. 17. Yet they are
both alike great, in regard of the Authority of Christ the Commander, Matthew.
28. 18, 19. And its too great boldness to alter any Commandment of Christ, for
the smallness of the matter, for it lies upon our conscience, not because it
is a greater or a lesser thing, and has degrees of obligatory necessity, lying
in it for the matter; but it tyeth us for the Authority of the Lawgiver: Now
Gods Authority is the same when he says, ( You shall not Worship false Gods,
but me the only true God) And when he says, ( You shall not add of your own
one ring or pin to the Ark, Tabernacle Temple) yea, either to break or teach
others, to break one of the least of the Commandments of God, makes men the
least in the Kingdom of God, Matthew. 5. 18. And to offend in one is to offend in
all, Iam. 2. 10. 2. That our things of Church-Policie are perpetual, we prove,
and that what we hold of this kind, we make good to be contained in the
Scripture, either expressly, or by due consequence; and, so the Church and their
Rulers, act nothing in our way, but as Subordinate to Christ as King and Head
of the Church, and Surplice, humane Prelates, Crossing, we hold unlawful in the
house of God, because they are not warranted by the King and Head Christ's word;
and because the devisers and practisers of these do neither devise nor act, in
these, as Subordinate to Jesus Christ as King, Priest, or Prophet, by the grant
of our Adversaries.

Hooker, l. 3. Eccles. Pol. page 124. The matters wherein Church-Policy are
conversant, are the public Religious duties of the Church, as administration
of the Word, Sacraments, Prayers, spiritual censures of the Church and the
like, to these the Church stand always bound; and where Policy is, it cannot
but appoint, some to be leaders of others, and some to be led; If the blind
lead the blind, they both perish: and where the Clergy is any great multitude,
order requires that they be distinguished by degrees, as Apostles and Pastors
were in the Apostolic Church: And number of specialities there are which* make
for the more convenient being of these principal parts of Policy.

Ans. 1. If Christ as King have appointed word and Sacraments in general, and
Censures; he has appointed the Word, Sacraments and Censure in special; to
wit, such a word, such Sacraments, Baptism, the Lord's Supper, such Censures,
Excommunication, admonition, or then he has left the Specialities of written
and unwritten Word, to the arbitriment of men, and that there be
Excommunication, or no Excommunication; and this Doctrinall and the like he
has left to men's devising; to wit, (Crossing is a Dedication of the child to
Christ) now Jerome Advers. Helvid. says Vt hec que scripta sunt non negamus,
ita ea quae non sunt scripta re^nuimus, and August. Lib. de pasto. c. 11.
Quicquid inde (e scriptura) Andieritis, hoc nobis been sapiat, Quicquid
extraest, respuite, n^ erretis in nebula. Now to say, we may receive some
truths of things Arbitrary or mutable, crosses Cyrill. Allexand. Glaphyre in
Genesis l. 2. (...).

That which the holy Scripture has not said, by what means should we receive,
and account it amongst these things that be true? Cyrill would deny all your
Ceremonies to speak any thing, but lies; and Basil. l. de Fide.
so would I: Yea, to bring in any thing that is not written, Basilius says, it
is (...), a demonstration of Pride, and Origin in Levit. Hom. 5. Si quid autem,
superfuerit, quod non Divina Scriptura decernat, nullam aliam debere tertiam
Scripturam ad autoritatem scientiae suscipi (licet) I think some third
Scripture which is neither the old or the New Testament must be sought to make
good the Doctrines, that dumb humane Ceremonies teach us: 2. That the blind
lead the blind is not safe; but it is no Argument to prove that this is an
immutable thing in policy, that there should be Leaders, and some that are led,
except you suppose the Prelates to be the seeing men, and the Pastors and
People to be blind. 3. I utterly deny this consequence: The Clergy is a great
multitude; Ergo, order necessarily requires, that by degrees they be
distinguished in Prelates and Pastors; for the Prelates are a multitude; Ergo,
order requires that one be Pope to command all the rest: The Apostles were a
multitude; Ergo, There was a necessity of a Monarch-Apostle, the Prelaticall
Government is Monarchical; does Order requires not a Monarchical Prelate.
order require in all multitude no Government but a Monarchy? Nor do we find
any warrant that Apostles had jurisdiction over Pastors in the Scripture, nor
in any Ecclesiastical Records; but where Papacy was working; Paul, as if he
had been to go out of this life, and never to see the faces of the Elders of
Ephesus, Act. 20. 25. Left unto them as Elders all of equal degrees of power
of jurisdiction, the feeding and Governing of the Church of God, Act. 20. 28,
29, 30. 4. The particulars of Policy, as Surplice, Crossing are no more
circumstances of Worship then Aarons Ephod, a vesture is a circumstance, but a
Religious vesture teaching us of Pastoral holiness, is worship, not a
Circumstance: Men can place no Religion in Circumstances.

Hooker, Eccle. Poli. l. 3. p. 125. It is in vain to argue from Christ's office,
if there be an immutable Platform in Scripture, it is as if one should demand
a Legacy by virtue of some written Testament, wherein there being no such thing
specified; he pleads that there it must needs be, and brings Arguments from
love and good will, which awayes the Testator bore him, imagining that these or
the like proofs will convict a Testament to have that in it, which other men
can no where by reading find, its our part to admire what he has done, rather
then to dispute what he in congruity of reason, ought to do: how unsearchable
are How the care and wisdom of Christ proves, that Christ has left an
unalterable platform in his testament,
his judgments?

Ans. 1. It is very true, a Platform of discipline is question facti, A
question of Fact, rather then Law; we hear nothing in this comparison, but what
Papists with equal strength of reason do bring for their unwritten Traditions;
for they say Protestants are to prove a fact and deed of Jesus Christ, that he
has left in his written Testament a perfect and immutable Platform of
Doctrine and manners, to which nothing can be added; and this they prove from
the care, wisdom and love of Christ to his Church, for he ought to reveal his
will perfectly, and completely in his Scripture, otherwise he has not the
love, care, and wisdom of a Lawgiver to his own people, if he leave them in
the mist, and in the dark, and write not down all things touching Faith and
manners: Now we can no where find by reading Scripture, any thing for the
Baptizing of Infants, or a remedy for women to be cured of Original sin in the
Old Testament in lieu of circumcision; we find no warrant for the Feast of
Dedication, in the Law of Moses, nor for the days of puring, observed by the
Jews, nor for Images, invocation of Saints, Prayer for the dead, the
perpetual Virginity of the Virgin Mary, and many such Doctrines which the
Church believes. But we answer, because these vain doctrines (we except the
Baptizing of Infants, warranted by Scripture) are not in Scripture, they are
the vain and saplesse doctrines of men, and will worship: But to press the
comparison, If any should demand a Legacy by virtue of a Testament, in which
the Testator has testified his good will, wisdom, care to his Brethren in such
a manner, that he had said; I have left in my Testament to my Brethren, my mind
to instruct them, for every good work, to lead them in all truth, to teach
them every good way, to understand equity, judgment and righteousness, to
cause them walk safely, so that their feet shall not stumble, and I have left
them my word to be a Lamp, and light to their feet in walking: Then I would
infer from this Testament two things: 1. That the love and care of our
Testator Christ, so revealed, warranteth us to plead for light in Christ's
Testament, how to walk in every good way, and so how to walk in all the ways
of the orderly worship of God, and of Governing of Gods house, by Pastors,
Teachers, Elders, Deacons, by their Lawful calling, qualifications, duties; by
the Churches Courts in admonition, excommunication, by the use of the keys: 2.
Because the Testament is perfect to instruct in every good way, particularly,
and in all duties of worship, and this Testament forbids all adding and
diminishing, and speaks not one word of Crossing, Cringing, and bowing to
Altars, of wearing of Surplice: Therefore these are not Gods Lawful ways, and
if I walk in them, I can do nothing but fall and stumble: 3. We do not here
argue simply from the wise, and congruous dealing of God, what he ought to do,
nor from the love of Christ, as a King and he^d simply, but from the love, care
and wisdom of Christ, as he is such a King and Head, upon whose shoulder is the
whole Government, and upon whom are all the vessels of the house, great and
small: 4. It is no less then blasphemy to ascribe the not particularizing of
Ceremonies, such as Crossing, Surplice, humane Feasts to the unsearchable
Wisdom, and ways of God, to which Paul, Romans 11. refers the great deeps
of Supernatural Providence in Gods Election and Reprobation, his calling of
the Gentiles and rejecting of the Jews; and observe (I pray) this consequence;
the ways of the Lord past finding out; Ergo, The Lord has set down no
Platform of Church-Policy in his Sons Testament; but has left it to the
wisdom of the Church to devise, Crossing, kneeling to Creatures, Surplice, or
some such like: But since we have a pattern of perfectly formed Churches in the
Apostles times, who had power even, In actu excercit^, of Discipline and
Church-worship, and the Apostles mention things of an inferior nature: How is
it that we have no hint of Crossing, Kneeling, Surplice, corner. Cap, nor any
such, like unto these? And yet they were as necessary for decency then, 1 Cor.
5. Col. 2. 5. 1 Cor. 11. 20. etc. Rev. 2. 1. 2, 14, 18, 20, 21. 1 Cor. 14. 40.
as now,

Others of great learning reply, that Christ is not the only immediate Mr.

Head, King, Lawgiver, and Governor of the Church, for that is quite contrary
to Gods Ordinance in establishing Kings, Magistrates, higher powers,
nurse-Fathers, Pastors, Doctors, Elders; for by this, there should be no Kings,
Parliaments, Synods, no power of jurisdiction in them to make Laws, to
suppress and punish all manner of Idolatry, Superstition, Heresies. But I
answer, that Christ is the only immediate Head, King, Lawgiver, and Governor
of his Church, as upon his shoulder only is the Government, Isa. 9. 6. And the
key of the house of David, Isa. 22. 22. And by what right he is the head of all
things; and set above all* principalities and power, and might, and dominion,
and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which
is t^ come; He is the head of the Catholic Church which is his body, Ephesians. 1.
21, 22, 23. And he is such a head even in externals, in giving Apostles,
Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers, who for the work of the
ministry, perfecteth the Saints, Collat. Roinal. cum, Io. Hartio. Sect. 2. p
40 Christ the only immediate King and head, and Lawgiver of his Church without
any deputy heads or Vicars, D. Roinald. 16. d. 41.
in whom the whole body (of the Church) is fitly joined together and
compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual
vvorking, in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body, to the
edifying of it self in love, Ephesians. 4. 11, 12* 13, 14, 15, 16. Now these places
makes Christ the only immediate head in externals, and internal operation of
that body which is the fullness of Christ: Let any of the Formalists, if Christ
be not the only immediate Head, Show us of King or Bishop who is the Mediate,
Ministerial, inferior Head of the Catholic Church, even in external
Government: For John Heart in his conference with D. Roinald, says, Christ is
the only principal, imperial, and invisible Head; but the Pope (says he) is
the visible and Ministerial Head; So do all Papists say; but our Protestant
Divines Answer, That it is a repugnancy that a Subject or a Member of the King
and Head, should be in any sense both a Subject and a King, a part or Member
and a Head; and Roynald says, This name to be Head of the Church is the Royal
Prerogative of Jesus Christ; Yea, the head, in externals, must be with the
Catholic body, as Christ has promised to be with his Church to the end of the
world; neither King nor Pope can in the external Government be with the
particular Churches to the end: It is true, the King may be with his Church by
his Laws and power; yea, but so may the Pope be, if all Pastors on earth be but
his Deputies, and if Pastors be but the Kings Deputies, and sent by the King,
so is the King the Head of the Church; but then the Catholic Church has as
many heads, as there be lawful Kings on earth; But we desire to know, what
mediate acts of Law-giving which is essential to Kings and Parliaments in
civil things, does agree to Kings, Parliaments, and Synods; Christ has not
made Pastors under-Kings to create any Laws morally obliging the conscience to
obedience in the Court of God, which God has not made to their hand; if the
King and Synods only declare and propound, by a power of jurisdiction, that
which God in the Law of nature or the written word has commanded; they are not
the Lawmakers, nor creators of that morality in the Law, which lays bonds on
the conscience; yea, they have no Organicall, nor inferior influence in
creating that morality, God only by an immediate act as the only immediate
King, made the morality, and if King, Parliaments, and Synods, be under Kings
and under Lawgivers, they must have an under-action, and a Ministerial
subservient active influence under Christ in creating as second causes, that
which is the formal reason, and essence of all Laws binding the conscience,
and that is the morality that obliges the soul to eternal wrath, though King,
Parliament, Pastors or Synods, should never command such a Moral thing: Now to
propound, or declare, that Gods will is to be done in such an act, or
Synodicall Directory or Canon, and to command it to be observed under Civil
and Ecclesiastical pain, is not to make a Law, it is indeed to act
authoritatively under Christ as King: but it makes them neither Kings, nor
Lawgivers, no more then Heralds are little Kings, or inferior Lawgivers, and
Parliaments, because in the name and Authority of King and Parliament they
Promulgate the Laws of King and Parliament: the Heralds are mere servants, and
do indeed represent King and Parliament, and therefore to wrong them, in the
promulgation of Laws, is to wrong King and Parliament; but the Heralds had no
action, no hand at all in making the Laws, they may be made when all the
Heralds are sleeping, and so by no propriety of speech can Heralds be called
mediat Kings, under-Lawgivers, just so here, as touching the morality of all
humane Laws, whether Civil or Ecclesiastical, God himself immediately; yea,
from Eternity by an Act of his free-pleasure made that without advice of men or
Angels, for who instructed him? neither Moses, nor Prophet, nor Apostle; yea,
all here are Meri precones, only Heralds; yet are not all these Heralds who
declare the morality of Laws, equals may declare them charitative, By way of
charity to equals, but these only are to be obeyed as Heralds of Laws, whom God
has placed in Authority, as Kings, Parliaments, Synods, the Church, Masters,
Fathers, Captains; And it follows no ways that we disclaim the Authority of
all these, because we will not inthrone them in the chair of the Supreme and
only Lawgiver, and head of the Church, they are not under-Law-givers and little
Kings to create Laws, the morality of which binds the conscience (for this
God only can do) Ergo, there be no Parliaments, no Kings, no Rulers, that have
Authority over men, it is a most unjust consequence; for all our Divines
against Papists, deny that humane Laws as humane, do bind the conscience* but
they deny not, but assert the power of jurisdiction in Kings, Parliaments,
Synods, Pastors.

SECT. III.
IF Jesus Christ be as Faithful as Moses and above him, as the Lord of the
house above the servant, Heb. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. Then as Moses was admonished of
God, when he was about to make the 5. Arg. As Moses and David were not to
follow their own spirit, far less is the will of the Church a rule to shape an
unalterable Government.
Tabernacle, for (says he) See thou make all things according to the pattern^
showed unto thee in the mount, Heb. 8. 5. And was not to follow his own spirit,
but was to follow the pattern that God showed him in the Mount, then far less
has Christ the Apostle and high Priest of our Profession giving us a Platform
of the Church and Government of the New Testament variable, and shaped
according to the alterable laws, customs and manners of diverse nations, for as
Moses though a Prophet was not to make one pin of the Tabernacle, but according
to the samplar and pattern that God did show him, so Christ manifested to his
Disciples, all that he had heard, and seen of the Father, Ioh. 15. But it is
not to be supposed, that the Father show to Christ an alterable tabernacle in
the new Testament, that men might alter, chop and change at their pleasure, as
the customs of Nations are changed: If God thought Religion should run a
hazard, if the greatest of Prophets (except Christ) might have leave to mold
and shape all the Leviticall Service, and Ceremonies, (for as the judicious and
Learned Interpreter Mr. David Dickson says, all the Leviticall Service Da.
Dicksonus, Expos. Analyti. in Epist, a^ heb. c. ^. v. 5.
is comprehended under the name of the Tabernacle, Exodus 25. 40.) according as
he pleased, far more should all be corrupted, if erring men, far inferior to
Moses, Prelates and Pastors, should have leave to draw the Lineaments of the New
Testament, Tabernacle, Church, Service, Officers, Censures, and all the
Positives of Policy according to no pattern shown by Christ; but only the
Fashions, alterable Laws, Customs, and forms of nations: Now all the pins of
the Tabernacle were but shadows, and Types of Moral and Heavenly things, Heb.
8. 5. Heb. 10. 1. Heb. 9. 9. And they were to be changed and done away by
Christ, Col. 2. 17. Heb. 7. 12. 2 Cor. 3. 11. Yet could neither be devised by
Moses, nor altered by any mortal man, Church or Priests; how can we imagine
that men may now devise and set up an alterable and changeable New
Testament-frame, of Prelates, Altars, Religious days, Surplice, Crossing, or
any the like toys? And though David was a Prophet, and a man according to Gods
heart; yet in the externals of the Temple, nothing was left to his spirit; he
might neither in the least jot add or omit, 1 Chronicles. 28. 11. Then David gave
to Solomon his Son, the pattern of the Porch, and of the houses thereof, and of
the Treasuries thereof, and of the upper Chambers thereof, and of the inner
Parlors thereof, and of the place of the Mercy-Seat. Here be many particulars;
But whence had David all these? From the pattern according to which, Cross,
Surplice, Altars, and humane Prelates are shapen? Alas, no; therefore it is
added, v. 12. And (he showed) the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of
the courts of the house of the Lord, and of all the chambers round about v. 19.
All this (said David) the Lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon
me, even all the works of this pattern. I see no reason to deny, that the form
of the Temple was written by the hand of God; as the Ten Commandments were
written in two Tables of stone by him; the Text seems to say no less, (...)
Pagni, and Ar. Mont. render it, Omnia in Scriptura, de manu domini, super me

It might have been written by Angels; though we go not from the letter of the
Text, we have from this Papist Tostatus, all we desire; for he says: We must
say that it was not by David's own thought, that he builded all; for David durst
not build a Temple to the Lord of his own heart; because he knew not if that
would please God, but by Divine Revelation: And therefore the old Translation
is corrupt in this, as in many things, which renders, v. 12. Thus: Dedit
David, Salamoni descriptionem p^rti^us, etc. Nec non et omnium que cogitaverat:
As if David's thought had been his guide; for (...) by the spirit, by Tostatus,
Corneli. a Lapide, Lyra, is meant, not David's spirit, but the spirit of
Revelation from the Lord; and Lyra says, on v. 12. Per hoc designatur; quod
deus pater dedit homini Christo notitiam omnium agendorum in ecclesia. And Pet.
Martyr, our own Doctor says, on 1 King. 8. It cannot be told how unpleasant
the institution of new worship is to God: And, there should be nothing in
Baptism but the Word and the Elements; any thing added (as Crossing, Oil,
Salt,) came from the Prelates: Lavater, in 1. Par. c. 28. ver. 14. condemns
all additions, even though Solomon should have added them, Ezech. 43. 11. Thou
Son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, -- 12. And if they be
ashamed of all that they have done, show them the form of the house, and the
fashion thereof, and goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all
the forms thereof, and all the Ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof,
and all the Laws thereof; And write it in their sight, that they may keep the
whole form thereof, and all the Ordinances thereof, and do them. Now it is most
considerable, that the Form, Fabric, and Structure of the Temple, Ezech. c.
40. In the visions of God, is shown to the Prophet by a man, by Christ the
great Angel of the Covenant; who with a measuring reed of six cubits, measured
the Temple; and in these chapters, c. 40, 41, 42. Christ shows to Ezekiel all
the pattern and form which evidently typifieth the Church of the New Testament,
the Bride the Lambs Wife in the Kingdom of Grace, and glorified in Heaven,
revealed by the Angel to John, Rev. 21. 9, 10, 11. It may be thought that the
Porches, Chambers, length and breadth of them East, West, South, and North, the
Laws about the Priests, their linen garments, Sacrifices, washing and the
like, are of less concernment then the Doctrine of Christ's nature, person,
offices of Faith, Repentance, Judgment, Heaven etc. And therefore being not so
necessary, nor so weighty; there was no necessity that all the like Positive
externals of Church-Policie, written to a rude and carnal people, should be
written to us, who are now more spiritual, and upon whom the dayspring from
above does shine, the shadows now being past; and who have greater liberty then
they had, who were as children under Tutors. Ans. 1. I do not deny, but all
Ceremonials are of less weight then the Morals; but the question is, if they
be of less Divine authority, so as we may devise of our own Spirit such
Ceremonials, and may alter, omit, or remove these, or any new Ceremonials in
the Sacraments under the New Testament; for New Testament Ceremonials, as to
take Bread, Eat and drink, are not so necessary, nor so weighty to us under the
New Testament, as the precept of believing in Christ, and of repentance from
dead works, yet I hope it shall be a weak inference, from thence to inser, we
may therefore alter and change any thing of the Sacrament, for the same Christ
who commanded us to believe in him, said also, Drink Ceremonials of Moses his
Law, are of less weight then Morals, but not of less divine authority.
ye all of this; and if we may not remove drinking from the last Supper,
because enjoined by Christ upon the authority of the Lawgiver, as signifying
the spiritual drinking of Christ's Blood, how can any dare to add Crossing to
Baptism, which signifies the dedication of the Baptized to Christ's service?
But 1. Divine Ceremonials, and positives which were to be changed, have these
notes and impressions of God, which Surplice, Cross in Baptism, Corner-cap,
(which by Analogy answers to Moses his Ceremonies) has not; and yet if they
be of the New Testament, and so Two notes of Divinity ought to be in the New
Testament Ceremonials, which were in Divine Ceremonies.
of a more excellent spirits devising then the people of the Jews were capable
of, in regard of their Bondage under Carnal Precepts, they ought to have them
in a more excellent manner: As 1. In regard of the manner of Revelation; all
the Laws and Ceremonial Ordinances were revealed to Moses when he was forty
days in the Mount with God, and was in Heaven and above men, Exodus 25. 40.
Heb. 8. 5. The length measure and pattern of the Temple was revealed to Ezechiel
when he was in the spirit, and saw the Visions of God, Ezech. 40. 2, 3. And a
writing of the form of the Temple by Gods hand, was delivered to David, 1 Chro.
28. 19. Now if a more free and glorious spirit teach the Positives of policy,
under the New Testament, such as Surplice, Crossing, then Prelates must be in a
higher mount with God, then Moses was, and in a deeper ecstasy of the visions
of God, then Ezechiel was in, Ezec. 40. 1, 2, 3. When they are in the
childe-birth pain of devising, and bring forth such defaced and dirty whelps,
as Surplice, Crossing, Altars, etc. 1. I should think it blasphemy so to think:
2. In regard of the Doctrine revealed: When I read the 40, 41, 42. Chapters of
Ezekiel touching the form of the Temple, and the Antitipe, Chapters the
Revelation, c. 21. c. 22. Yea, and the very Ceremonial Laws of Moses, as the
scape-goats going to the wilderness with the sins of the people of God, and
all the rest of the Laws that points at Christ to be slain for us, and the
heavenly mysteries of the Gospel explained especially in the Epistle to the
Hebrews: when I read these, I find a strong smell of the ointments of a
precious Redeemer, the extreme love of God to man: the Majesty, the divinity
and efficacy of divine power in these, as in other Scriptures: But should our
Prelates, put in Print by the spirit of the new Testament, some Epistles
touching Ceremonies in General, or of Surplice, Corner-cap, Crossing, and
their heavenly relation to the mysteries of the Gospel in particular, I should
not think men would dare to say a nobler spirit speaks like God and heaven in
these then in the other.

It is without all Warrant to expound Christian Liberty of a power of devising
a mutable Church-Policy, and laws not warranted in Gods word, seeing Christian
Liberty expressly exempteth us altogether from obedience to men's Laws not
warranted by Christ's word, Gal. 5. 1. Col. 2. 20, etc.

Let us hear what Hooker says, for his mutable Policy under Eccles. Policy,
book 3. page 122.
the New Testament: Christ is not less faithful then Moses, because Moses
delivered to the Jews some Laws that were durable, and Christ some Laws that
are changeable, otherwise by this reason Christ shall be less faithful then
Moses; for Moses erected in the How Moses doing all according to the pattern
proves an immutable platform.
wilderness a Tabernacle, which was moveable from place to place; Solomon a
stately Temple, which was not moveabl^: Therefore Solomon was faithfuller then
Moses, which no man endued with reason will think: Christ was faithful, and
says, I have given to them the words that thou gave me: He concealed not any
part of his Fathers will: But did any part of that will require the
immutability of Laws concerning Church-Policy?

Ans. I answer, as Christ did to the Jews in another case, Ioh. 6. 32. Moses
gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father gives you that true bread:
So in this, neither Moses nor Solomon erected either that Tabernacle or Temple,
as Lawgivers, but the Father of our Lord Jesus, as the true Lawgiver: Now
both were but mere servants and Heralds in all that they did, for God showed to
Moses the pattern of the Tabernacle, and to David and Solomon the form of the
Temple, in all the pins, rings, chambers, cubits, length and breadth, Exodus 24
40. 1 Chronicles. 28. 11, 19. And the question is not if ever the Lord himself
delivered mutable or immutable Laws, either in Doctrine or Policy: We grant he
did, and may deliver Laws changeable and to endure for a time only in both the
old and new Testament, Heb. 7. 18. Col. 2. 17. Act. 15. 28, 29. But the
question is, if Moses as a man, if Christ as a man only, if the Church of
Prelates, yea, or of Lawful Officers can be faithful, if they deliver laws
to the Church, which may be altered, without the express will of God, speaking
in his word at the pleasure of men, and which are positives of worship and
Policy, such as humane Prelates, Surplice, Cross, etc. which varieth, dies
and lives, falls and rises with the climate, Nation, civill-Government,
Laws, Manners, and customs of People; and this is all one, as to move the
question, whither the Ambassador as a man, may alter the Articles of his
Commission, according to his own private lust, without an express and evident
Warrant of the Prince and State, whose servant and Messenger he is in all that
he does, and if he be a faithful Ambassador, who does his own will, and not
the will of those that sent him, and if Christ be as faithful as Moses, if he
had given Laws of policy under the New Testament to be altered without an
express and evident Warrant from the will of the Father, at the pleasure and
will of men? This we deny; and certainly, say that Moses had erected a
changeable Tabernacle at the will of man, and Solomon a Temple unchangeable at
the will, and express Commandment of God, then had Solomon been faithfuller
then Moses; our Arguments nerves do not consist in the immutability, or the
mutability of things themselves, or of the Laws, but on the immutability or
mutability of things positive, or Laws positive, under this reduplication, so
as they be immutable or mutable at the pleasure and will of men, without and
beside the word of God, such as Cross and Surplice, and such like Romish
stuff are pretended to be. 2. Certain it is, that Christ concealed not any
part of his Fathers will, Ioh. 17. 8. But delivered all, and this place, with
the place, Ioh. 15. 15. We urge against the traditions of Papists, and say,
because Christ spoke nothing from his Father either in his own person, or his
Apostles in the New Testament, or in the old by Moses and the Prophets, of
invocation of Saints, Purgatory, Worshipping of Images, and Relics and the
rest of their unwritten Traditions, these being positives of worship, and more
then unseparable, and connaturall attendants, such as are common, Time, Place,
Person, Name, Country, Habit, Gesture, are therefore unlawful, because Christ
neither heard them of the Father, nor spoke them to the Apostles, and just the
like say we of Surplice, Cross, etc. That they are no part of the will of God,
which the Father revealed to Christ, and these same Texts Papists use, to prove
that the Scriptures are not perfect, because they speak nothing of the
Traditions of the Church; so Bellarmine, Because the Counsel of Trent,
Andradius, Stapleton, and all the rest, and they prove as well, if Cross and
Surplice, and humane Offices, as Prelates, stand good and lawful, that yet the
Scriptures are unperfect: 3. We say that the whole will of God revealed by the
Father to Christ, and by Christ to the Prophets and Apostles, requires the
immutability of all Laws of Church-Policy in this sense, that men should not
dare to make and unmake, erect, command, alter, and injoyne positive Laws, of
doctrine or policy at their pleasure.

Hooker, ibid. p. 113. There is more reason to say that God has a less care
of the Church under the New Testament, then under the Old; then a Philosopher
had to say, because God has provided better for beasts that are born with
horns, skins, hair and garments by nature, then man who is born without these,
that therefore nature is a careful mother to beasts, and a hard-hearted
Step-dame to man: for Gods affection consists not in these, for even herein
shines his wisdom, that though the ways of his providence be many, yet the
end which he brings all at the length unto, is one and the self same: yea, it
should follow that because God has not prescribed Rites, and Laws of civil
Policy to us, as to the Jews, that he has less love to us, and less care of
our Temporal estate in the world then of theirs.

Ans. 1. Its true indeed, God should have less care of man, who is born naked,
then of beasts born with hair in lieu of garments, if God had not given reason
to man according to which by nature, he may provide garments for himself, and
the comparison should go Gods care for us leads us to think he has given us
a better guide then natural reason, in all Positive Morals of Church-Policie.
aptly on four feet, God should have less love, and should declare less love
to some of mankind, if he gave some natural reason to devise a Bible and a
Religion of their own that they might walk to heaven in the light of a fire of
their own kindling, without the Scriptures of God (which is a false
supposition) and if he had denied reason to another part of mankind, surely
all would say, God had so far forth been more careful of the salvation of the
former, as he should have willed their salvation, and loved those in a higher
measure to whom he gave reason on these terms, and should have been less
careful of the salvation of those to whom he denied reason, as he he had no
more created such capable of salvation and of his love for the saving of them,
then brute beasts are: and this answer lays down a ground that natural
reason is sufficient without the light of Scripture to guide us in all these
things of policy that are alterable, then (say I) God did take a great deal of
needless and superfluous pains in setting down so many particular Laws of
Ceremonies and Civil Policy, for the Jews, if with the help of reason, they
might have steerd their course to Christ and salvation, by the help of the star
light of reason, as a man though born naked may by help of reason, make shift
for garments to infants, which beasts void of reason cannot do: for thus the
comparison must run, and it shall be indeed a cavilling at Gods wisdom, as
Papists do calling the Scriptures inky Divinity: 2. The word of God makes it a
Theologia, Atramentaria.
great love of God, and a work of Free grace, that the great things of Gods Law
are written to Ephraim, Hos. 8. 12. And their sin the greater, that they should
dare to multiply Altars, v. 11. without warrant of Gods word, as Formalists
multiplied, Altars, Saintsdayes, Surplices, etc. And it is an act of singular
love, that God gave his judgments, Word, and Statutes, even of Ceremonies, and
policy to Israel and Jacob, and did not so to every Nation, Psalm. 149. 19, 20.
Ezekiel. 20. 11, 12, 13. This was Isreal's excellency above all Nations on earth,
Deuteronomy. 4. 6. Deuteronomy. 20. 33. Romans 3. 1, 2. Romans 9. 4. that God gave them
particular Laws, Judgments, Statutes, not only in Morals, but also in
Ceremonials, and Policy: yet Hooker dare say, We may not measure the affection
of God toward us, by such differences. 3. It shall not hence follow God has a
greater love to the Jews then to us, because he gave them Laws, concerning
civil policy, which he gave not to us. Except the Lord had given us power to
make civil Laws, which laid Moral obligation on our consciences, even in
civil things, which morality He expressed in particular Laws written to them,
and not to us, as Formalists teach, for then he has left us in Moralls, to the
darkness of natural reason, in which condition we could not but err and sin,
and make that morally good and obligatory of conscience, which is morally evil,
for reason knows not what is positive Morally good, except the light of Gods
Word teach us; and in Morals, such as judicial Laws were to the Jews, the Lord
should have been more careful in his particular directing of them, then of us,
and more tender to have them preserved from the sin of will worship, then us,
which cannot consist with the Dispensation of less light; greater obscurity in
regard of types and shadows toward them, and of the Daylight of the Gospel, and
the arising of the Day Star, and the filling of the earth with knowledge of the
Lord toward us, under the New Testament: But the comparison must go upon this
supposition, that the Lord purposed to make Politic Laws in their Positives,
Moral and Obligatory of the Conscience of the Jews, and the Civil Laws of the
Gentiles under the New Testament in their Positives (such as is not to carry
Armor in the night, and the like) not to be Moral nor Obligatory of the
Conscience. But as touching that which is Moral in all Civil Laws, the Lord
is as careful of our Temporal state, as of theirs, in condescending to
particularize all Morals to us, as well as to them.

Hooker, That Christ did not mean to set down particular Positive Book of
Eccles. Polici^, 3. page 113, 114.
Laws for all things, in such sort as Moses did; the very different manner of
delivering the Laws of Moses and the Laws of Christ, does plainly show, Moses
had Commandment to gather the Ordinances of God together distinctly, and
orderly to set them down according to their kinds, for each Public duty and
Law: But the Laws of Christ we rather find mentioned by occasion in the
writings of the Apostles, then any solemn thing directly written to comprehend
them in a Legal sort. 1. The Law Moral and Ceremonial were not delivered one
and the same way; the former was uttered by the Voice of God, in the hearing of
six hundred thousand. 2. Written with Gods finger. 3. Termed^a Covenant. 4.
Given to be kept without time, how long, or place where. The latter not so, and
restricted to the Land of Jury, Deuteronomy. 4. 5. 12. Deuteronomy. 5. 22. And if God had
respect in Positive Laws, to time and place, and the Manners of that Nation,
seeing Nations are not all alike, then the giving of one kind of Positive Laws
unto one only people, without any Liberty to alter them, is but a slender
proof, that therefore one kind should be given to serve everlastingly for all.
Ans. This Argument reduced to form, shall want both matter, and form, and
reason. If the Laws of Moses be distinctly and orderly set down, and gathered
together according to their several kinds for each Duty; and The occasional
writing of things in Scripture, no reason why they are alterable.
the Laws of Christ be occasionally only written; then Christ did not mean to
set down particular Positive Laws, for all things in such sort as Moses did.
But this difference is true, Ergo, etc. Both the Major Proposition and the
Assumption are false, and neither of them can be proved: For the occasional
writing of some Articles of Faith, and of Dogmaticall points, should then prove
that Christ meant not to set down all Articles of Faith particularly; for
Christ, Matthew. 22. upon occasion of the Saduces tempting; Paul, upon occasion
of some at Corinth who denied the Resurrection, 1 Cor. 15. And of some that
mourned for the dead, 1 Thessalonians. 4. Set down and proved an Article of Faith, to
wit, the Resurrection of the dead: By this Argument the Scripture is not full
and perfect, in Fundamentals, as Moses is in Ceremonials, but has left such
and such Fundamentals to be altered, added or omitted by the Church, in that
way, that Surplice, Cross, and Altars, are alterable things. Most of Dogmatick
points concerning Christ's sufferings, are occasional, as his taking, his
betraying by Judas, who knew the place he was in, the valuing of him at Thirty
pieces, the giving him Gall and Vinegar, a punishment not intended by the
Judge, but occasional, in that Christ said he thirsted; Yea, the Crucifying of
him rather then Barrabas, upon occasion of the malice of the people, when
Pilate had scourged him upon a Policy, to see if the people would demand he
might be released, the casting Lots for his garment, the Crucifying of him
between two Thieves, the not breaking of his bones upon occasion he was dead,
the piercing of his side; all which in regard of second causes, were
occasional, and so though Dogmaticall and Doctrinall, these must be all such
alterable and Ambulatory points of Doctrine, as the Church and Prelates may
change at their godly discretion, and Christ meant not in these, to set down
particular Positive Laws in such sort as Moses did. Yea, the Evangel according
to Luke, is set forth occasionally; because many have taken in hand to set
forth in order a Declaration of these things which are most firmly believed;
therefore is seemed good to Luke also to write, Luke 1. 1, 2, 3, 4. Upon
occasion of Onesimus his fleeing from his master; The Epistle to Philemon was
written upon occasion of the unconstancy of the Galathians, whose faith was
perverted by false teachers, that of Justification by Faith, without the works
of the Law: And the Epistle to the Galathians was written, most, if not all the
Canonic^ Epistles were written either upon occasion of false Teachers, or for
fear they should be scandalized at Paul's bonds. By this vain Argument, the most
part of Canonick Scripture should be alterable, imperfect, not particular in
most Doctrinals, no less then in Ceremonials; And so the Major Proposition is
most false, for its a vain thing to Collect Christ's meaning, to set down
particulars of either Doctrine or Ceremonies, from occasions of Providence; for
most of the Scripture is penned upon occasions from men, and from second
causes, shall these things leave off to be of Divine Institution, that has
their rise from occasions, even sinful occasions? Yea, the death of Christ is
occasioned from man's fall in sin. What then? Is it an alterable Doctrine left
to the determination of the Church that Christ died? But this is no other then
the shift of Papists for their unwritten Tradition. Sanderus de Visib. Monarch.
Lib. 1. c. 5. page 13. Si ergo per solas conscriptas leges dei civitas Papists
pretend that things are not written in the word, because of the various
occurrences of Providence.
gubernaretur in valde magna part little que passim contingunt, quid faceret,
nesciret, quia legem de his loquent^m non haberet; Imo si tantum una Lex toti
reipub: necessaria esse posset, eaque ipsa scriberetur a prudentissimis viris,
ac singulis annis ab orb condito novae interpretationes eidem adderentur:
tamen nunquam eveniret, ut ea lex tam plene interpretata foret, quin causae
novae possent intervenire* ob quas lex et legis interpretatio novam iterim
postularet interpretationem, adeo et foecunda est natura in suis eventis, et
Angustum ingenium humanum, et varia surisperitorum sententia, et verba tum
pauca, tum ambigua. All comes to this, that this Papist says, That there
cannot be one written unchangeable Law that is necessary for the whole Church,
for new events, occasions and occurences of Providence, should so change the
case, that there should be a necessity of a new interpretation, and of a new
Law. 2. Nor can we say that Laws made upon occasion, as that Law of
transferring the inheritance to the Daughter, made upon occasion of the
Daughters of Zelophehad, are in this sense occasional, that the Jews might at
their pleasure alter, or change a Law made by God, and substitute one of their
own in place thereof; for then might the Jews change all the Ceremonies and
Judgments that God gave them for a time and occasionally: Now then they might
have abolished Circumcision, the passover, and substitute other Sacraments in
their place, for these Sacraments were not given by Gods own voice. 2. Nor
written by Gods own finger. Nor, 3. Are they termed a Covenant, in that sense

the Moral Law is termed a Covenant. 4. Nor are they given without limitting
of time and place, expressly when and where: Now if the Church of the Jews could
change Sacraments at their pleasure, because their Sacraments were no part of
the Eternal Law Moral, they might alter all Gods Law, as the Church may alter
Surplice, Crossing; and I see not, but the Church of the New Testament upon the
same ground, may alter the Sacraments of the New Testament. Papists, as Vasquez
Becanus, and others say, that neither the Pope nor the Church can add or
devise a new Article of Faith: Yet does Horantius Loco Catholice. l. 2. c. 11.
fol. 129. teach, That Christ has not taught us all fully in the New Testament,
but that the holy spirit, shall to the end of the world, teach other new things
as occasion shall require. And this he brings as an Argument to prove, that
there must be unwritten Traditions, not contained in Scripture; even as the
Formalists contend for unwritten Positives of Church-Policie.

3. Morals of the Law of nature and the Moral Law, do more respect occasions
of Providence, customs, Laws, and the manners of people (they doing so nearly
concern our Moral practice) then any Ceremonies of Moses his Law which did
shadow out Christ to us, and therefore this reason shall prove the just
contrary of that for which its alleged; for the Moral Law should be rather
alterable at the Churches lust, then Ceremonials, for there be far more
occurrences of Providence in regard of which the Laws Moral touching, what is
Sabbath breaking, whether is leading an Ox to the water on the Sabbath a breach
of the Sabbath? (the Jews held the affirmative, Christ the negative) touching
obedience to Superiors, Homicide, Polygamie, Incest, Fornication, Oppression,
Lying, Equivocating: Then there can be occasions to change the Law of
sacrificing, which clearly did adumbrat Christ, who was to be offered as a
sacrifice for the sins of the world; yea, all significant Symbolicall
Ceremonies have their spiritual signification independent from all occasions
of Providence, and depending on the mere will of the Instituter; Surplice, or
white linen, signifies the Priests holiness, without any regard to time,
place, or national customs; for Christ might have made an immutable Law,
touching the Symbolicall, and Religious signification, and use of Saints-dayes,
white linen, Crossing, and all the rest of humane Ceremonies, which should
stand to Christ's second coming, notwithstanding of any occurrences of
Providence, no less then he made an immutable Law, touching the Sacramental
obsignation of water in Baptism, and of Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper, if
it had not been his will never to burden his Churches with such dumb and
tooth-lesse mysteries as humane positives: 4. The assumption is false, for
diverse Ceremonial Laws now altered were made without any regard to occasions
of Providence, and many Doctrinals that are unalterable were made with special
regard to such occurrences: 5. If positives of Policy be alterable, because the
occasions of such are alterable by God; it shall follow that God who has all
revolutions of Providence in his hand, must change these Positives, and not the
Authority of the Church: and thus Doctrinals are alterable by God, not by men,
which is now our question; for Christ has given a Commandment; Take ye, Eat
ye, Drink ye all of this: Yet has he not tied us in the time of persecution to
conveen in public, and Celebrate the Lords Supper; but the Church does not
then change the Law, nor liberate us from obedience to a Command given by God,
but God liberateth us himself.

Hooker. But that which most of all makes to the clearing of this Hooker, 3.
Book, page 114. 115.
point, is, that the Jews who had Laws so particularly determining, and so
fully instructing them in all affairs what to do, were not withstanding
continually inured with causes exorbitant, and such as their Laws had not
provided for, and so for one thing, which we have left to the order of the
Church; they had twenty which were undecided by the express word of God; so
that by this reason, if we may devise one Law, they may devise twenty: Before
the Fact of the sons of Shelomith, there was no Law that did appoint any
punishment for blasphemers, nor what should be done to the man that gathered
sticks on the Sabbath. And by this means God instructed them in all things from
heaven, what to do: Shall we against experience think that God must keep the
same, or a course by Analogy answering thereunto with us as with them? Or
should we not rather admire the various and harmonious dissimilitude of Gods
ways in guiding his Church from age to age; Others would not only have the
Church of the Jews a pattern to us, but they would (as learned Master Prynne
with them says) take out of our hand the Apostolic Church, that it should be
no rule to us; for says he, There was no Uniform Church Government in the
Apostles times, at the first they had only Apostles and Brethren, Acts 1. 13.
no Elders, or Deacons: Their Churches increasing, they ordained D^acons, Act.
6. And long after the Apostles ordained Elders in every Church, after that
widows in some Churches, not at all. In the primitive times some Congregations
had Apostles, Acts 4. 11, 12. 1 Cor. 12. 4. to 33. Evangelists, Prophets,
workers of miracles, Healers, etc. Horantius, loc. Catho. Lib. 2. c. 12 f^l.
131. Turrian. to. de fide, spe. et Charit. disp, 20. duo. 2. Bell^rm. de Verb
dei non script. l. 4. c. 3. That there was no Vnif^rm Platform of Government in
the time of Moses and the Apostles, is no Argument that there is none now.
Other Churches at that time had none of these Officers or Members, and all
Churches have been deprived of them since those days. Ans. 1. What Hooker
says, is that which Bellarmine, Sanderus, Horantius, and all Popists say, for
their Traditions against the perfection of the word, to wit, that the word of
God, for 2373. years between Adam and Moses (says Horantius) was not written,
so Turrianus, Bellarmine, and the reason is just nothing, to say the Jews might
devise twenty Laws, where we may devise one, because the Jews were continually
inured with causes exorbitant, such as their written Laws had not provided for.
This must be said which is in question, and so is a begging of the
controversy, that the Jews of their own head, and Moses without any special
word from God, or without any pattern shown in the mount, might devise what
Laws they pleased, and might punish the blasphemer, and the man that gathered
st^cks on the Sabbath, and determine, without God, the matter of the Daughters
o^ Zelophehad, as the Formalists teach, that the Church without any word of God
or pattern from the word, may devise humane Ceremonial Prelates, Officers of
Gods house shapen in a shop on earth, in the Antichrists head, and the Kings
Court, the Surplice, the Cross in Baptism, and the like. Now we answer both
them and Papists with one answer, that it is true, there was no written
Scripture between Adam and Moses which was some thousands of years: Yea, nor a
long time after till God wrote the Law on Mount Sinai: But withal, what God
spoke in visions, dreams, and apparitions to the Patriarchs, was as binding and
obliging a pattern interditing men then to add the visions of their own brain
to what he spoke from heaven, as the written word is to us, so that the Jews
might neither devise twenty Laws nor any one of their own head, without
express warrant of Gods immediate Tradition, which was the same very will and
truth of God, which Moses committed to writing; if then Formalists will assure
us of that which Papists could never assure us, we shall receive both the
unwritten Traditions of the one, and the unwritten Positive inventions of
Cross and Surplice, devised by the other: as 1. Make us sure, as God himself
immediately spoke to the Patriarchs, and to Moses, nothing but what after was
committed to writing by Moses and the Prophets at Gods special Commandment, as
Papists say, their unwritten Traditions are agreeable to the word, and though
beside Scripture, yet not against it: And the very will of God no less then
the written word; and let Formalists assure us, that their positive additaments
of Surplice and Cross are the same which God commands in the Scriptures, by
the Prophets and Apostles, and though beside, yet not contrary to the word:
But I pray you what better is the distinction of beside the word, not contrary
to the word of God, out of the mouth of Papists, to maintain unvvritten
Traditions, which to them is the express word of God, then out of the mouth of
Formalists, for their unwritten Positives, which are worse then Popish
Traditions in that they are not the express word of God, by their own grant?
2. Let the Formalist assure us, that after this, some Moses and Elias shall
arise and write Scripture touching the Surplice and Cross, that they are the
very mind of God, as the Lord could assure the Church between Adam and Moses,
that all Divine truths which he had delivered by Tradition, should in Gods due
time be written in Scripture, by Moses, the Prophets and Apostles: I think they
shall here fail in their undertakings. Hence the Argument stands strong, the
Jews might devise nothing in doctrine, Worship, or Government; nay, neither
the Patriarchs nor Moses, nor the Prophets of their own head, without Gods
immediate Tradition, or the written Scripture (which are all one) Ergo, Neither
can the Church, except she would be wiser then God in the Scriptures. 2.
Hookers Various and Harmonious Dissimilicude of Gods g^iding his Church, is his
fancy: This variety we admire, as it is expressed, He^. 1. 1. But Hooker would
say (for he has reference to that place) God at sundry times, and in diverse
manners, spoke in time past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, and now to us by
hi^ Son: But test of all, he has revealed his Will, by the Pope of Rome, and
his cursed Clergy, that we should Worship Images, pray to Saints, and for the
dead, believe Purgatory, etc. and now by humane Prelates, he has shown his
will to us, touching Crossing, Surplice: Now Papists, as Horantius, Sanderus,
Malderus, Bellarmine, and others Horantius, in lo. Catholic* l* 2. c. 12. fol.

Fundamentals were by succession delivered to the church, yet are they not
alterable.
say, Most of the points that are in Question between them and Protestants, and
particularly Church-Ceremonies, are unwritten Traditions delivered by the
Church; beside the warrant of Scripture* 3. We grant that there was no Uniform
Church Government in the Apostles time, Deacons were not at the first, Elders
were not ordained (...), in every Church: But this is nothing against a
Platform of Uniform Government* which cannot be altered in Gods Word. For by
this reason the Learned and Reverend Mr. Prynne, because points of Government
did grow by succession of time; cannot infer therefore that Government which
the immediately inspired Apostles did ordain in Scripture, is alterable by men;
then because, 1. Fundamentals of Faith and Salvation, were not all delivered at
first by God; there is no Uniform, no unalterable Platform of Doctrinals and
Fundamentals set down in Scripture. For first, the Article of Christ's death and
incarnation, was obscurely delivered to the Church in Paradise: Sure the
Article of Christ's making his Grave with the wicked, of his being put to death
for out Transgressions, though he himself was innocent; his justifying of many
by Faith, were after delivered by Isaiah, Chap. 53. And by succession ^f time,
many other Fundamentals, as the Doctrine of the written Moral Law, in the Moral
Positives thereof, were delivered to the Church: But I hope from this
successive Addition of Fundamentals, no man can infer* 1. There is no Uniform
Platform of the doctrine of Faith, set down in the Old Testament. 2. None can
hence infer, because all points* Fundamental were not delivered to the Church
at first; the refore the Church* without any express warrant from God, may
alter the Platform of Fundamentals of Faith, as they take on them to add
Surplice, Crossing, etc. and many other Positives to the Government of Christ
without any express warrant of the Word. 3. Our Argument is close mistaken, we
argue not from the Pattern of Government, which was in the Apostles times, at
the laying of the first stone in that Church; then the Apostolic Church had
indeed no Officers; but the Apostles and the seventy Disciples we reason not
from one piece, but from the whole frame, as perfected by the Ministry of the
Lords Apostles. 2. We argue not from the Apostolic Church, as it is such a
Church; for Apostles were necessary then, as was community of goods, miracles,
speaking with tongues, etc. but we draw an argument from the Apostolic Church;
as the first Christian Church, and since the Law was to come from The church of
Jerusalem as perfected in Doctrine, and Discipline, is our pattern. Acts 1. 4.
Zion, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem, Isai. 2. 3. And the Lord was to
reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem before his Ancients gloriously, Isai. 24.
23. And the Lord was to reign over his people in Mount Zion, from henceforth
and for ever, Micah 4. 2, 7. And Christ for that gave a special command to his
Disciples, not to depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the
Father, which they had heard from Christ; therefore this Church of Jerusalem
was to be a rule, a pattern and copy for the Government of the Visible Kingdom
and Church of Christ, in which Christ was to reign by his own Word* and Law,
Mi^. 4. 2, 7. And so the Spirit descended upon the Apostles in the framing and
Governing of the first Church, in so far, as it was a Christian Church, and
they were to act all, not of their own heads, but as the Holy Ghost led them in
all Truth, in these things that are of perpetual necessity; and in such as
these, the first Church is propounded as imitable: Now we do not say in
Apostles, which had infallibility of writing Canonick Scripture, in Miracles,
speaking with Tongues, and such like, that agreed to the Apostolic Church, not
as a Church, but as such a determinate Church in relation to these times, when
the Gospel and Mystery of God, now manifested in the flesh, was new taught, and
never heard of before, did require Miracles, gift of Tongues, that the Gospel
might openly be preached to the Gentiles, we do not (I say) urge the Apost^like
Church and all the particulars for Government in it, for a rule and pattern to
be imitated. And if Master Prynne deny, that there is an Uniform Government in
the Apostles times, because God himself added to them Deacons and Elders, which
at first they had not, and removed Apostles, miracles, gifts of healing, and
tongues: then say I; First, the Canonick Scripture is not Uniform and
perpetual: Why, for certainly once there was no Canonick Scripture but the
Books of Moses, and after the holy Ghost added the Book of the Psalms, and the
Prophets; and after the Nativity and Ascension of our Lord to Heaven, the
Apostles did write Canonick Scripture: I hope, this is but a poor Argument to
infer, that there is no Uniform and unalterable Platform of Divinity in the Old
and New Testament, and yet the Argument is as concludent the one way, as it is
the other: 3. We do not so contend for an Uniform and unalterable Platform of
Church Government in the Word; as it was not free to the Lord and Lawgiver to
add, and alter at his pleasure, only we hold it so Uniform and unalterable,
that this Platform is not shaped like a coat to the Moon, or alterable at the
will of men, without express warrant of the Lords Word, and to rise and fall
with the climate, and the elevation of National customs; and therefore the
Argument is nothing concludent, and judge what can be made of these words of
the learned Mr. Prynne: Mr. Prynne, Truth Triumphing, etc. p. 128.
The Government and Officers of all Churches, not being De facto, one and the
same in all particulars in the very Primitive times, as well as since, it can
never be proved to be of Divine right, and the self same in all succeeding
Ages, without the least variation, ^inee it was not so in the Apostles days:
For this is all one as to say, the Canonick Scripture was not one and the same,
in the Apostles and Prophets times, but admitted of diverse additions; Ergo, now
in our days Canonick Scripture is not one and the same, but may also suffer
the like additions: 2. Because God himself added to Canonick Scripture, and to
the Government of the Church in the Apostles days; Ergo, men may without
Warrant from God, add in our days to Canonick Scripture, and to the
Government and Officers of the Church: 3. The Government and Officers in the
Apostles time were not of Divine right, but alterable by God; Ergo, Apostles,
Evangelists, Pastors, Teachers, Workers of miracles were not of Divine right in
the Apostles times, but might have been altered by men, without the express
Warrant of God: But will any wise man believe that Paul's Apostleship was
alterable, and might be changed by the Church? Since he says, Gal. ^. 1. Paul
an Apostle, not of men, neither by men, but by Jesus Christ, and 1 Cor. 12. 28.
When Paul says, And God has set (...), or instituted some in the Church;
first, Apostles, secondly, Prophets, thirdly, Teachers, after that miracles,
then gifts of healing, etc. and Ephesians. 4. 11. When Christ ascended on high, he
gave some Apostles, some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some to be Pastors
and Teachers, 12. For the perfecting of the Saints, etc. Can it enter into the
head of any man to say, some Churches had Apostles and Evangelists, and
Pastors, and miracles, and some not; Ergo, Apostles, and Pastors, are not by
Divine right; Ergo, because they were not in all Churches, therefore they were
alterable at the will of men? and a Surplice, and Cross in Baptism has as
much of Divine institution, as the calling of the Apostle, or of a Pastor, and
truly to me, it is bold Divinity to say, that Pastors set over the flock by the
holy Ghost, Act. 20. 28. and whose due qualifications are so specified, 1 Timothy
3. and Elders, 1 Timothy 5. 17. and Teachers placed by God in the Church, 1 Cor.
12 28. may be all turned out of the Church, by men, as having no Divine right
to be there, and that men may set up other alterable Officers in their place;
for by this reason the Apostles, by that ordinary spirit, that is now in
Church-Rulers, might without their Apostolic spirit, or any immediate Warrant
from Christ, have altered the whole frame of Apostolick-Government, and
Church Officers, as the Church may upon motives from themselves not warranted
from the word, turn out Surplice, Cross, and all such stuff out of the
Church.

Master Prynne. The Apostles speech, 1 Cor* 12. 4, 5, 6. There are Mr. Prynne,

diversity of gifts, but the same spirit, there are diversity of operations,
but the same God, compared with chap. 8. to 13. and c. 9. v. 19. to 24. I made
my self a servant to all, that I might gain all, etc. paralleled with Act. 15.
1, 2, 5, 6, 10. to 32. and chap. 21. 18. to 30. The Churches of Judea did
retain the use of Circumcision, Purification, and other Jewish Rites, which the
Gentiles by the Apostles resolution were not to observe, and Act. 2. 22. The
Apostles frequented the Jewish Temple, and Synagogues (conforming themselves to
the Order and Discipline thereof) and their own private Christian Assemblies;
all this will clear, that all Churches had not one and the self same
Church Government. Ans. If diversity of Gifts, as to be a speaker with Tongues,
a Prophet, a Pastor, will prove the Discipline to be alterable at the Churches
will, as are Surplice, Cross, etc. I shall think men may infer any thing they
please out of the Scripture; and that to be Apostles, Past^rs, are as
indifferent and variable as eating of meats, 1 Cor. 8. and Paul's taking of
wages at Corinth, 1 Cor. 9. Which none can say; for if the Church should now
command us to abstain from such and such meats, as the Apostle does, 1 Cor. 8.
We should call that, and do call it, in the Romish Church, a Doctrine of
Devils, 1 Timothy 4* 1, 2, 3. All brought for this, from Act. 15. Act. 21. tends
to this, the Lord himself for the then weakness of the Jews, of mere The
indifferency of some things in the Apostolic Church, cannot infer that the
Government is alterable.
indulgence appointed some things to be indifferent, and abstained from, in the
case of scandal: Therefore Circumcision, Purification, Sacrifices of Bullocks,
and sheep; And all the Ceremonies of Moses his Law, may be commanded by the
Church, so they have another signification then they had before, and shadow out
Christ who is already come: But because God has made some things indifferent,
shall it follow that the Pope, yea, or any Church on earth can create an
indifferency in things? they must then take from things their Moral goodness
or convenience with Gods Law, and take from them their moral badnes, and
disconveniency to Gods Law, which to me is to change the nature of things, and
to abrogate and change Gods Laws: it is true, P. Martyr, 1 Cor. 9. 19. says,
Paul was made all things to all men, Quoad Ceremonias, and res medias, in that
he Circumcised Timotheus: The Law (says he) was abrogated, V^rum id non adhuc
Judaeis liquebat; The Jews were to be spared for a time, but only for a time,
and therefore when the Gospel was sufficiently promulgated; Paul said, Gal. 5.
to be Circumcised was to lose Christ, and he refused to be a servant to Peter
in his sinful Iudaizing, Gal. 2. And withstood him in the face: Now, certain it
is, Peter knew Christ was come in the flesh, and that his Iudaizing did not lay
bands on his conscience, he preached the contrary, Act. 11. And if Peter did
Iudaize, as Formalists observe Ceremonies, and the Galathians were circumcised
the same way (for they knew Circumcision had no Typical Relation to Christ to
come, they believed he was already come) then without cause, Paul, Gal. 2. and
5. did rebuke, and argue either Peter or the Galathians of sinful Iudaizing;
which to say, were to speak against the Gospel. But certainly the Uniformity,
and immutability of all these Ceremonies was, that then when the Gospel was
sufficiently Proclaimed to all, to be under the Law of Ceremonies in any sort
was damnable, and so is it now: And as the Apostles and Church then set up no
Ceremonies, no Surplice, no Crossing, because they had no word of Christ to
warrant them, neither can we do the like now; and they complied for a time with
the Jewish Ceremonies, being yet indifferent, but not but by warrant of the
commandment and resolution of the Apostles, and the like are we obliged unto
now, had we a Warrant of the like indifferency of Prelates, Surplice, Cross,
and that we were obliged to use them to gain the weak, in regard: 1. They were
once obligatory Ordinances of God: 2. And if the day light of the Gospel were
not yet sufficiently risen to shine upon those who are not wilfully ignorant,
and had not yet acknowledged the Gospel to be Gods word, we should also be
obliged to Ceremonies; yea, we durst not yield to any Law to lay them aside, as
many Formalists, who hold them lawful, have done.

Mr. Prynne. From the Creation till Moses, there was no one Universal Ibid.
set Form of Church Government, to be observed in all the world: Nor one Form
of Discipline under the Tabernacle, another under the Temple.

Ans. All this concludes not what is in question; its but the Popish Argument:
This is to be concluded, that Enoch, Seth, Noah, Abraham, the Patriarchs and
Moses did set up a Church Government of such timber as Humane Prelates, Cross,
Surplice, without any express Warrant from Gods mouth, and which they might
alter by their own spirit; for this Argument is, God might alter; Ergo, The
Church now may alter without a warrant from God. And shall we believe that the
Patriarchs and Moses by their own spirit without any Commandment of God, might
at their pleasure set up, and put down Prophets, Circumcision, Tabernacle,
Temple, Laws for Sacrifices, Priests, Levites, Arc, putting the Leaper in, or
putting him out of the Camp, cutting any soul off from the Congregation of the
Lord, as our men will cry up, and down Ceremonies, and put on them the weight
of a Talent, or a Feather, without any word of God? The Scripture cries the
contrary so often, saying, And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, speak thou
unto the children of Israel: Could Formalists say that, and Christ spoke unto
the Prelates, and the Church, and said, Command the Pastor to cross the Infant,
and appoint unto your selves a Prelate over the Pastors: I should gladly agree
to the mutable frame of humane Government.

Mr. Prynne. There are but for the most part, general rules prescribed Ib. p.
129.
to us for the very ordering and regulating of our thoughts, words, actions,
lives, apparel, Children, servants, families, calling, etc. in the Word; Ergo,
there be but general rules for Discipline and Church Government, which admit
variety; the former do more immediately concern every man, the other more
remotely.

Ans. If the Word of God do not more particularly regulate our thoughts, as,
Psalm. 10. 4. Psalm. 5. 9. Isa. 55. 7. Ier. 4. 14. Act. 8. 22. And our words and
actions by which we must be judged, Isa. 3. 8. Ier. 8. 6. Mal. 3. 13. Ier. 9.
3. Matthew. 12. 36, 37. Rev. 22. 12. Rev. 20. 13. 2 Cor. 5. 10. Prove. 5. 21. 1 Samuel 2, 3. Psalm. 119. 9. Prove. 3. 23, 24. Then the Scripture does warrant
Surplice, and Crossing, and kneeling to Creatures, and humane Prelates, which
are changeable, and alterable circumstances and adjuncts of Worship, that may
be, and may not be, and things indifferent; it shall follow, that for the most
part, it is indifferent to do evil or well, sin or not sin, in thought, word
and actions; and we have no warrant in Scripture for eschewing sin, or not
eschewing it in the most of our actions. I confess there is little need to
walk, (...) accurately, Ephesians. 5. 15. And to cleanse our ways, Psalm. 119. 9.
according to the Word; If words, thoughts and actions, may go at random, as if
they were variable and indifferent Ceremonies, God throws not men in hells
torments, to be eternally miserable, for circumstances* 2. For the acts of our
calling, if they be Moral, they are regulated as particularly by the word, as
to believe, love and fear God, or the creature; Mr. Prynne, Truth triuphing, p.
130, 131, 132, 133. The Argument of Moses his doing all to the least pin, in
the Tabernacle by special direction, considered.
if artificial, they are not of our consideration. 3. That Moral acts of
decent usage of the Ordinances, do not immediately concern men, is admirable to
me.

Mr. Prynne: To the Argument of Moses his doing all according to the pattern
shown in the Mount, It is Answered: 1. The Tabernacle wa^ no part of the Church
of the Israelites; but only the place of meeting for Worship, answerable to our
Churches and Chapels, and so was the Temple; But I pray you, God prescribed
the height, length, breadth, form of Tabernacles, Ark, Altar, of every Pin,
Ergo, Has Christ as punctually prescribed to all Christians, and Nations, in
express words, the form, matter, dimensions of all Christian Churches,
Temples, Chapels, Tables, Challices, Pulpits, Pews, not varying in one pin. 2.
God named the men, Bezaliel, and Aholiah, who should make the Tabernacle and
all the implements thereof. 3. God expressed the frame, fashion, colors, of
the holy Garments of Aaron and his sons: shall it follow, Ergo, only the
Artificers whom God names, immediately, and none but Embroyderers, Goldsmiths,
Carpenters, etc. Not Pastors and Elders are to build up the spiritual Churches
of Christ, Ergo, The form, matter and color of Ministers, and Elders garments
are particularly set down in the New Testament. 4. The Tabernacle and Temple
were corporal things made by men's hands, not spiritual buildings of men's
spirits. 5. All these of the pattern were delivered to Moses the Temporal
Magistrate, not to Aaron the Priest; Ergo, the Church under the Gospel is not a
spiritual building, whose maker and builder is God; and all is to be ordered
by the Civil Magistrate, and Lay-Artificers, not by Pastors: I wonder also you
allege not Noah's Ark: And all in the New Testament, are not so particularly
set down, as in the Old. Ans. The Tabernacle was no part of the Church; but
being a Type and the implements of it, to the least pin, particularly expressed
by God to Moses; far more must we have from God an express for every Ceremony,
not to retort this also, that a Corner-Cap, or a Surplice, is no part of the
Church, and is indeed a teaching sign, and so should not be counted a Positive
of Church-Policy. 2. Most false it is that the Tabernacle and Temple were
nothing but a meeting place of the people for Worship, as our Churches or
Chapels, are, 1. Because it is to Argue the Holy Ghost of want of wisdom, to
spend so much Canonick Scripture in setting down things idely, not tending, at
all to edification, and teaching us nothing of God, and in specifying the Form,
Height, Length, Breadth, Curtains, Candlesticks, Sockets, Rings, of natural
places that contained their bodies; for what should it edify us, if God should
describe so particularly all the Churches and meeting places of the people
under the New Testament? Now certain it is, Whatsoever things were written
before time, were written for our Learning, Romans 15. 4. 2. Many things in the
Tabernacle, as Candles in day light, Rings, Sockets, Shewbread, belonged
nothing to a natural place, as our Chapels, or Meeting houses do. 3. Expressly
the Scripture makes them more then places; to wit, Holy, Religious, and
Typical signs of Divine institution; as the Tahernacle was a Type, Heb. 8. 2.
5. Heb. 9. 1, 2. etc. Heb. 10. 1, 2, 3. And the Temple a Type of Christ's body,
Ioh. 2. 19. Ioh. 1. 14, 15. And all these were Types and shadows of Heavenly
things, Heb. chap. 8, 9, 10. Gal. 4. 1. 2. etc. Col. 2. 16. 17. Which our
Churches and Chapels are not, being only places common to sacred and Civil
actions. 2. God therefore can no more in express words set down, the form,
matter, dimensions of Christian Churches and Chapels, then of the Synagogues
of the Jews which had no Moral use for edification and instruction. 3. Yea,
because the Tabernacle and Temple and their implements, were teaching shadows
of good things to come, and our Churches and Chapels are not so, nor have they
any Moral or Religious use or influence on our spirits as the Tabernacle and
Temple had; therefore the Lord, who is express in all Morals, which of their
own nature do teach and edify; he behoved to name Bezaliel, and Aholiah, and
the form and color of the Priests garments, which also are Typical, and could
not name our Elders, or the color or form of their Garments. 4. All these weak
retortions, suppose that the Tabernacle and Temple were types of our meeting
houses for Worship, which is a mere conjecture; they were no more types of our
Chapels, then of the Jewish Synagogues; we may not expound types at will, but
as the Holy Ghost expounds them to us in the New Testament: And this is a
conjecturall Exposition, and a dream to make Bezaliel and Aholiah, types of
Embroyderers and Tradesmen.

5. We know the Tabernacle and Temple were corporal things made with hands,
and that they are things different from the spiritual things that they
signify; as the sign and the thing signified; as therefore the Lord is
express in the elements and Rites of the Supper of the Lord, because all of
them, Bread, Wine, taking, eating, breaking, pouring out the Wine, drinking,
are teaching and edifying signs; and our Lord never left it to the wisdom of
men, to devise signs to teach themselves: so in like manner, should the Lord
expressly specify all the teaching and signifying signs in the Old Testament;
and as Moses might devise none of his own, but was tied to follow the pattern,
which the Lord himself showed to him in the Mount: So are we now under the New
Testament, tied to the pattern of that same will revealed in the Word; and it is
laid on us, Not to be wise above that which was written; and it is of
perpetual equity: The supreme Lawgiver, never left it to the wisdom of
Angels, or Men, or Prophet, Apostle or Church, to serve and Worship God as they
thought good: But he himself particularly prescribed the way, signs, and
means: And because God has not been pleased in the New Testament to specify
types of Christ incarnate, and come in the flesh already; therefore are we
obliged in Conscience to believe, and practice no more, either in Doctrinals,
or teaching types, or Positives of Church-Policy, then our Pattern in the Mount,
the Scripture has warranted to us, to be the will of God, and in this and this
only, stands the force of the present Argument unanswered by paterns of
unwritten Traditions, and not in these loose consequences, that we under the
New Testament should have these types and Policy that the Church of the Jews
had, which is the Doctrine of Papists and Formalists following them, not ours;
for they prove their Pope and Prelat from the Jewish High Priest, their
Surplice, from the linen Ephod of Jewish Priests; their Humane Holidayes, from
the Jewish days; their kneeling to bread, from their bowing toward the Ark. 6.
It is not true, that the Tabernacle and Temple were mere corporal things, no
more then bread and wine in their spiritual relation, are mere corporal
things: The Lords end, use and intent, in the Tabernacle and Temple, was, that
they should be to the people Images, and shadows of heavenly and spiritual
things, Heb. 8. 5. Heb. 10. 1. 7. That all the things of the Tabernacle, were
delivered to Moses as a King, and not as a Prophet and writer of Canonick
Scripture, Heb. 3. 5. Heb. 8. Luke 24. 44. 27. Luke 16. 31. is an untruth,
except Formalists make the King so the head of the Church, in prescribing Laws
for the Policy thereof, as they make him a Canonick writer, as were David,
Moses, Solomon, from whose example they would prove the King to be the head of
the Church: But I judge Moses saw the pattern in the Mount, and God face to
face, as a Prophet whose words are Scripture to us, Deuteronomy. 34. 10. And there
arose not a Prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knevv face
to face; And as a Prophet, not as a King, his face did shine, Exodus 34* 27, 28,
29. And he was commanded as a Prophet, to write the Law not as a King, Numb.
12. 6. 7. Moses is made the most eminent Prophet that was in the Old Testament.
And why? Because God spoke to other Prophets by Dreams and Visions* But he
spoke the Law and written Scripture to Moses, mouth to mouth: This should not
be a comparison between Prophet and Prophet, but between The Ark of Noah
proves the same.
Prophet and King, by this learning. 8. We judge Noah's Ark does prove the same,
it being a special type of the Church, 1 Pet. 3. 20, 21. And he built it by
Faith, Heb. 11. 7. And so by a Word of God, and at Gods special direction, in
all the length, breadth, forms of it, and not of his own head, Genesis 6. 14, 15,
etc. And is Calvin, Com. in Genesis 6. 22. Quare discamus per omnegenus
impedimenta perrump^re, nec locum dare pravis cogitationibus quae s^ Dei verbo
opponunt, hunc enim honorem haberi sibi, flagitat Deus, ut ^um si^am^^s

commended by the spirit of God for so doing, Genesis 6. 22. Thus did Noah
according to all that God commanded him, so did he. And Formalists should
deserve the like Testimony, if it could be said of them, And as the Lord
commanded the Church, in creating Prelates, Surplice, and all the positives of
Church-policy; so did she. And so says Calvin, on Genesis. 6. 22. And P.
Martyr, and Musculus piously on this place: and with them, Vatablus. Hence I
judge all other things in this, and the following Arguments Answer.

They have a general Commandment of God, though not a special. Ans. So have
all the unwritten Traditions of Papists; hear the Church, she is Magistra
fidei; so does the Papist Horantius answer Calvin, That the spirit of God has
given a general and universal knowledge of mysteries of Faith and Ceremonies
belonging to Religion, but many particulars are to be received by tradition
from the Church: but of this hereafter. 2. Master Prynne answers that is a
wresting, These Texts (says he) speak only of additions to books or doctrines
of Canonical Scriptures then written, not of Church Government or Ceremonies;
yea, God himself after the writing of Deutronomy caused many Canonical books
of the old and New Testament to be written: Many additions were made to the
service of God in the Temple not mentioned by Moses. Another answer R. Hooker
gives, teaching with Papists, Bellarmine (as in another place after I cite)
with Cajetane, Tannerus and others; That additions that corrupt the word are
here forbidden, not additions that expound and perfect the word: True it is,
concerning the word of God, whither it be by misconstruction of the sense, or
by falcification of the words, wittingly to endeavor that any thing may seem
Divine, which is not, or any thing not seem, which is, were plainly to abuse
even to falcifie divine evidence: To quote by-speeches in some Historical
narration, Mr. Prynne, Truth Triumphing p. 134. Hooker, 3. book Eccle. pol. p
93.
as if they were written in some exact form of Law, is to add to the Law of
God. We must condemn (if we condemn all adding) the Jews dividing the supper
in two courses: their lifting up of hands unvvashed to God in Prayer, as
Aristaeus says, Their Fasting every Festival day till the sixth hour. Though
there be no express word for every thing in speciality, yet there are general
Commandments for all things; say the Puritans, observing general Rules, of 1.
Not scandalizing: 2. Of decency: 3. Of edification: 4. Of doing all for Gods
glory. The Prelate Usher, in the question touching traditions; We speak not of
Rites and Ceremonies, Usher in his Answer to the Jesuits challenge of
Traditions page 3^, 36.
which are left to the disposition of the Church, and be not of Divine, but of
Positive and Humane right: But that traditions should be obtruded for Articles
of Religion, parts of Worship, or parcels of Gods word beside the Scriptures,
and such Doctrines as are either in Scriptures expressly, or by good inference
we have reason to gainsay.

Here is a good will, to make all Popish Traditions that are only beside, not
contrary to Scripture (and in the Popish way all are only Formalists
acknowledge additions to the word of God, contra^y to Deuteronomy 4. 2. and 12. 32.
The same way that Papists do.
beside Scripture) as Lawful, as our Ceremonial additions, so they be not
urged as parts of Canonical Scripture: Well, the places Deuteronomy. 4. and 12. Prove.
30. Rev. 22. (say our Masters of mutable Policy) forbid only Scripturall, or
Canonical additions, not Ceremonial additions: But I wonder who took on them
to add additionals Scripturall: if Baals Priests should add a worship of
Jehovah, and not equal it with Scripture, nor obtrude it as a part of Moses's
Books, by this means they should not violate this precept: Thou shall not add
to the word, etc. 2. Additions explaining the Word, or beside the Word, as
Crossing the bread in the Lord's Supper are Lawful, only additions corrupting,
or detracting from the word, and everting the sense of it, are here forbidden,
and in effect these are detractions from the word, and so no additions at all
by this distinction are forbidden, but only detractions: The word for all this
will not be mocked, it says, Thou shall not add, Thou shall not diminish.

But the truth is, a Nation of Papists answer this very thing for their
Traditions. 1. Bishop Ans. to the 2. part of Refor. Catho. of Trad.. 5. page
848. The words signify no more, but that we must not either by addition, or
substraction, change or pervert Gods Commandments, be they written, or
unwritten: Else why were the Books of the Old Testament written afterward; if
God had forbidden any more to be written or taught, beside* that one Book of
Deutronomy? Shall we think that none of the Prophets that lived and wrote many
Volumns after this, had read these words, or understood them not, or did
vvilfully transgress them? D. Abbot answers, What the Prophets vvrote, serve
to explain the Law, they added no point of Doctrine to Moses Law, for Exodus
24, 4. Moses vvrote all the words of God, Deuteronomy. 31. 9, 10. Moses wrote this
Law, then he vvrote not a part of the Law, and left another part unvvritten.
The Jesuit Tannerus answers the same in terminis with the Formalists:

falsitatem omnino removet. Lira. Hic prohibetur additio depr^vans intellectum
legis, non autem additio declarns aut clucidans, Tostatus in Loc. Q. 2. Ille
(pecat) qui addit, addit tanquam aliquid de textu, vel necessarium, sicut alia
qu^ sunt in textu velut dictum a spiritu sancto, and hoc vocatur proprie
addere. Formalists (as Dr. Morton say) It is sin to add to the word any
thing, as a part of the written word, as if Ceremonies were a part of the
written Scripture, and spoken by the immediate inspiring spirit that dyteth
Canonick Scripture, they come only a^ Arbitrary and ambulatory adjuncts of
Worship from the ordinary spirit of the Church, and are not added as necessary
parts of Scripture, or as Doctrinals; so Papists say, their traditions are not
additions to the written word, nor necessary parts of the written Scripture,
but inferior to the Scripture. 1. They say their Traditions are no part of the
written word or Scripture; for they divide the word of God in two parts, as
Bellarmine, Turrian, Tannerus, Stapleton, Becanus, all of them say, Aliud est
verbum dei scriptum and dicitur Scriptura sacra, aliud est verbum dei non
scriptum, and dicitur ecclesiae traditio; There is one word of God written,
called the holy Scripture; And there is another word of God not written, and
it is called the Tradition of the Church.

Now their Tradition is no more a part of the Scripture (but another part of
the word of God contradistinguished from Scripture) then the body is a part of
the soul, or Scotland a part of England, for both England and Scotland are
collateral parts of great Britain; the Scripture (say they) is the unperfect
rule of Faith, and not the complete will of God, as touching Faith or manners,
but Scripture and Tradition together, are the perfect and total rule: so say
Formalists, that Scripture is the complete and perfect rule of Faith and
manners to regulate all our Moral acts; But the other part of the distinction
is, that Scripture is not a complete and full rule to regulate all our Moral
Acts whatsoever, whither of Faith or manners or Church-Policy, as it is no rule
to my conscience and practice to believe, for orders, cause and obedience to my
Superiors, and for decency that I am to wear a Religious significant linen
creature called a Surplice, or not to wear it, or that I am to exercise, or
not exercise that grave action of drawing my thumb Cross the Air above the
face of a Baptized Child while I baptize, to betoken his dedication to
Christ's service: And hitherto neither Traditions, nor Positives of
Church-Policy are added, as necessary parts of written Scripture: 2. Traditions
are not added to the Scripture, by Papists, as coming from the immediately
inspiring spirit that dyted and wrote Scripture, more then our Ceremonial
Positives of policy: Its true, Papists say they come from an infallible spirit:
But Formalists (I hope) refer not their unwritten Positives to so noble blood;
yet in this, they agree that Traditions are not added by them, as descending
from the immediate inspiring spirit of written Scripture: Therefore Cornelius a
Lapide says, Non addetis ad verbum quod vobis loquor, aliquid, scilicet
tanquam meum, vel a me dictum aut jussum, nulli enim homini licet prescripta
aut precepta sua pro preceptis a deo (a spiritu sancto immediate inspirante)
dictatis, aut pro Scripturis sacris addere; It is not lavvfull for any man to
add to the word any thing of his own, as his own, or as spoken and
commanded by himself: For no man may broach his own injunctions and precepts,
as if they were the precepts taught by the immediate inspiring spirit, speaking
in the Scriptures. Hence Papists teach that their Traditions flow from a little
lower Spring, then from the immediately inspiring Scripturall spirit; So I make
this good from famous Jesuits; Cornelius a Lapide, in Deuteronomy. 4. 1, 2. says,
Sed et ipsi judaei multa addiderunt legi, ut coelaturas, omnemque ornatum
templi; ut festum sortium sub Eester, festum dati ignis, festum Encaeniorum
etc. Hec enim non a de^, sed a judaeis sancita et instituta sunt, denique hec
non sunt addita, sed potius inclusa legi dei: Quia Lex jubet obedire
parentibus, Magistratibu^, pontificibus eorumque legibus. The Jews (says he,
objecting the instances of Formalists) added many things to the Law, as the
ingraving and adorning of the Temple, the feast of Purim, of Dedication etc.
And these traditions were not ordained and instituted by God (Ergo, not by the
immediate inspiring spirit, as is the Holy Scripture) but by the Jews, and they
were not added to the Law, but included in the Law, because the Law bids
obey Superiors and their Laws; whence it is evident, that these very
Ceremonial traditions of Papists, for which Formalists contend, are not added
to the word as coming from God, or the immediately inspiring spirit that diteth
scripture; but from the Church, without warrant of Scripture, just as Popish
traditions, which we count unlawful additions to the word. And Tannerus the
Jesuit says, Tom. 3. in 22. de fide, spe et cha. dis. 1. de fide Q. 1. Dub. 8.
That the assistance of the spirit that the Church has in proposing unwritten
traditions, requires no positive inspiration or speech made by God to the
Church; but it is enough that the Church have a very negativehelp of God only,
by which she is permitted not to err: His words are these: Nam assistentia
illa dei, qua ecclesiae adest, ne ejusmodo rebus fidei (in traditionibus non
scriptis) proponendis erret, por se non dicit, nec requirit positivam
inspirationem, se^, locu^^on^m Divinam ipsi ecclesiae factam, sed contenta est
quovis auxilio dei etiam mere negativo, quo fit ut ecclesia ijs in rebuus non
sinatur errare: Cum tamen nova revelatio utique novam inspirrtionem seu
Locutionem dei aliquid positive notificantem significet. And the like says
Malderus, in 22. de virtu. Theolog. That, though traditions come from an
infallible spirit, no less then Scripture; yet traditions are the Word of God,
because they are heard and constantly believed: But the Holy Scripture is the
Word of God, because written by the inspiration of the holy spirit. Q. 2. Art.
1. Dub. 4. page 83. And therefore he makes two sorts of traditions, some
merely Divine, which the Apostles received either immediately from the Holy
Ghost, or from the mouth of Christ, as those touching the matter and form of
the Sacraments: Others (says he) are properly Apostolic, as those touching
the Lent Fast, instituted by the Apostles. ib. tract. de trad. Q. Vnic. Dub. 1.
Traditiones (inquit) per apostolos traditae, aliae sunt Divine, quas immediate
ipsi a spiritu sancto dictante, v^l ex ore Christi acceperunt; ut de materia et
potissimum de formis sacramentorum; aliae autem propri^ dicuntur Apostolica, ut
de Iejunijo Quadragesimali, quod Apostoli I^stituerunt. Hence it is evident, if
Papists cannot but be condemned of impious additions to the Scriptures, by
these places, Deuteronomy. 4. Deuteronomy. 12. Formalists are equally deep in the same crime:
and the same is the answer of Malderus, ibid. Dub. 2. vetat. Apoc. 22. Ne quis
audeat Divinam prophetiam depravare, assuendo aliquid aut abradendo. Turrianus,
tom. de fide. spe. et cha. de traditio. disp. 20. Dub. 2. page 255. Respondetur

Learned D. Roynald Answers, Apolog. These. de sac. Script. page 211, 212. and
says: This very Law of Moses promises life Eternal to those that love the
Lord with all their heart, and, that the Prophets added to the Writings of
Moses, no Article of Faith necessary to be believed* but did expound and apply
to the use of the Church, in all the parts of piety and Religion, that which
Moses had taught. Lorinus, follows them in Deuteronomy. 4. 1. Christus (inquit) et
Apostoli pentateucho, plura adjecerunt, immo in vetere Testamento, Iosue,
Prophetae, Reges, Christ (says he) and the Apostles added many things to the
five Books of Moses; yea, in the Old Testament, Joshua, the Prophets and the
Kings, David and Solomon, did also add to Moses. But the truth is, suppose any
should arise after Moses, not called of God to be a Canonick writer, Prophet,
or Apostle, and should take on him to write Canonick Scripture, though his
additions for matter were the same Orthodox and sound Doctrine of Faith and
manners, which are contained in the Law of Moses and the Prophets; he should
violate this Commandment of God: Thou shall not add. For Scripture contains
more then the sound matter of Faith; it contains a formal, a heavenly form,
style, Majesty and expression of Language, which for the form, is sharper then
a two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit,
and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of
the heart, Heb. 4. 12. If therefore, the Prophets and Apostles had not had a
Commandment of God to write Canonick Scripture, which may be proved from many
places of the Word, they could not have added Canonick Scripture to the
writings of Moses. But the Answer of D. Roynald, is sufficient and valid
against Papists, who hold that their Traditions are beside, not contrary to the
Scripture; just as Formalists do, who say the same for their unwritten
Positives of Church-policy: But our Divines Answer, That traditions beside the
Scripture, are also traditions against the Scripture, according to that, Gal.
1. 8. But if we or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Gospel, (...), beside
that which we have preached unto you, Let him be accursed: And Papists more
ingenious then Formalists in this, confess, That, if that of the Apostles,
Gal. 1. 8. be not restricted to the written Word, but applied to the Word of
God in its Latitude, as it comprehends both the written word or Scripture,
and the unwritten word or Traditions; then beside the word is all one with
this, contrary to the word, which Formalists constantly deny. For Lorinus the
Jesuit says, Comment. In Deuteronomy. 4. 2. Quo pacto Paulus Anathema dicit, Gal. 1.
8. Iis, qui aliud Evangelizant preter id quod ipsi Evangelizaverit, id est,
adversum et contrarium. So does Cornelius a Lapide, and Estius expound the
place, Gal. 1. 8. And they say, that Paul does denounce a Curse against those
that would bring in a new Religion and Judaism beside the Gospel: But withal,
they teach, that the Traditions of the Church are not contrary to Scripture,
but beside Scripture; and that the Church which cannot e^re, and is led in all
truth, can no more be accused of adding to the Scripture, then the Prophets,
Apostles and Evangelists who wrote after Moses, can be accused of adding to
Moses his writings; because the Prophets, Apostles and Evangelists, had the
same very warrant to write Canonick Scripture, that Moses had; and so the
Church has the same warrant to add Traditions to that which the Prophets,
Evangelists and Apostles did write; which they had to add to Moses; And
therefore the Council of Trent says, S. 4. c. 1. That, unwritten traditions
coming either from the mouth of Christ, or the ditement of the holy spirit, are
to be recieved and Religiously Reverenced with the like pious affection and
Reverence that the holy Scriptures are received, Pari pietatis affectu ac
Reverentia; And the truth is, laying down this ground, that the Scripture is
unperfect, and not an adequat rule of Faith and manners, as Papists do; then it
must be inconsequent, that because Traditions are beside the Scripture, which
is to to them but the half of the Word of God; Yea, it follows not, this
Popish ground supposed, that Traditions are therefore contrary to the
Scripture, because beside the Scripture, no more then it follows that the
Sacraments of the New Testament, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord, in all
their positive Rites and Elements are not ordained and instituted in the Old
Testament; and in that sense (...), beside the Old Testament; that therefore
they are against the Old Testament; though we should imagine they had been
added in the New Testament, without all warrant of special direction from God,
by the sole will of men; or because some Ceremonials commanded of God, are not
commanded in the Moral Law or Decalogue, either expressly or by consequence;
and so these Ceremonials, though instituted by the Lord, be beside the Moral
Law; that therefore they are contrary to the Moral Law: Yea, to come nearer,
because the third Chapter of the Book of Genesis, containing the Doctrine of
man's fall and misery, and Redemption by the promised seed, is beside the first
and second Chapters of the same Book, it does not follow that it is contrary,
or that Moses adding the third Chapter, and all the rest of the five Books, did
therefore ^ail against this precept, Thou shall not add to that which I
command thee: for certain it is, that there are new Articles of Faith in the
third chapter of Genesis, which are neither in the first two Chapters expressly,
nor by just consequence; but if the Church or any other of Jews or Gentiles
should take upon them to add the third Chapter of Genesis to the first and
second, except they had the same warrant of Divine inspiration that Moses had
to add it, that addition had been contrary to the first two Chapters, and
beside also, and a violation of the Commandment of not adding to the word; so
do Formalists and the Prelate Usher in the place cited presuppose that the
Scripture excludes all Traditions of Papists, because the Scripture is perfect
in all things belonging to faith and manners, but it excludes not all
Ceremonies, which are left to the disposition of the Church, and be not of
Divine, but of Positive and humane Right: Hence it must infer the principle of
Papists, that the Scripture is not perfect in all Morals, for it is a Moral of
Decency and Religious signification, that a child be dedicated to the service
of Christ, by the sign of the cross. Now what can be said to thi^, I know not,
but that the sufficiency, and perfection of scripture does no whit consist in
holding forth Ceremonials; but only in setting down doctrinals. Why? and
Papists say the same, that the scripture is perfect, though it teach us not any
thing of tradionals in special, yet in general it does hold forth the
traditions of the church.

So Tostat. Abulens. in Deuteronomy. 4. v. 2. ad lit. says, Hic commendatur lex ex
perfectione, quia perfecto, nec addi potest, nec auferri debet: Here the Law of
God is commended (says he) from its perfection, and that is perfect, to which
nothing can be added, and from which nothing should be taken: Yea, so far forth
is the scripture perfect, in the Articles of Faith, that Castro in summa. c. 8.
Canus locor. Theolog. l. 2. c. 7. and l. 4. c. 4. and Tannerus tom. 3. in 22.
disp. 1. de fide. Q. 1. dub. 7. says, We are not now to wait for any new
revelation of any verity unknown to the Apostles, Et nihil novi definiri ab
ecclesia Apostolis incognitum, and all verities now revealed were implicitly
believed by the Apostles, and contained in Universal general precepts, as
that the Saints are to be worshipped, that Canonical Books contains the word
of God: the Bishops of Rome are the true successors of Peter, and Catholic
pastors, etc. and he says, Quod ecclesia non posset novum fidei articulum
condere, communiter etiam docent Scholastici in 3. dis. 25. and he subscribeth
to that truth of Vincentius Lyrinensis, c. 17. In ecclesia nulla nova Dogmata
procudi, sed pretiosam divini Dogmatis Gemmam exsculpi, fideliter cooptari,
adornari sapienter, ut intelligatur illustrius, quod antea obscurius
credebatur: No new points of says, or manners are forged in the Church, but
the precious pearl of divine truth is in it polished, faithfully applied and
wisely illustrated, that they may be more clearly understood, which before was
more obscurely believed; so that to say, the perfection of scripture consists
not in particularizing all the small positives of policy, is no more then
Papists say of the perfection of the scripture in their traditions. 2. Moses
speaks both of the Moral and Ceremonial Law, called by the names of (...)
Statutes rights, and (...) Judgments and Laws whatsoever extolled by David,
Psalm. 119. As his delight, his joy, his heritage, his songs in the house of his
pilgrimages, and of both he says, that there is life in keeping them: Now the
Ceremonies of Moses had an exceeding great excellency in looking to Christ, and
being shadows of good things to come, Heb. 10. 1. And our Ceremonies have the
same aspect upon Christ: Why? but the day of the commemoration of Christ's
Death, Nativity, Ascension; Dedication to Christ, by a Cross in the Air,
should have the same influence and impression on our hearts (if they be
lawful) that the like Ceremonies and Laws had upon David's spirit, Christ being
the object and soul of both? 2. Of these Ceremonies and Laws, Moses faith,
(...) v. 6. for this is your wisdom, and your understanding in the sight of the
Nations: Why? but these same Ceremonies looking with a broader and fuller face
on Christ already come (if Christ have put any life of lawfulness in them)
then their dim shadows of old, should also be our: wisdom in the hearing of
Pagans, who know not God? 3. It is a wonder to me that the learned Master
Prynne should say that the place, Deuteronomy. 4. speaks nothing of
Church Government and Ceremonies, but only of Doctrines of Canonical Books:
For that is as much as to say the place speaks nothing of Divine Ceremonies,
but only of divine Ceremonies, for what a number of Divine Ceremonies and Laws
are in the Law of Moses, which were given by the Lord himself? as is clear by
the words, ver. 1. Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the Statutes and
judgments that I teach you, that ye may live, and v. 5. Behold I have taught
you Statutes and judgments, which the Lord my God commanded me, v. 8. And what
nation is there so great, that has statutes and judgments so Righteous, as
all this Law which I set before you this day? Now of all this Law the Lord
says, v. 2. Ye shall not add unto the Word which I commanded you, Neither
shall ey diminish. The Learned and Reverend Mr Prynne, must restrict this word
of the Law, which can admit of no addition, to some special Law, either the
Moral only, or the judicial and Ceremonial only, not to the former; for then
additions to the Decalogue only, should be forbidden; this never man taught:
Stapleton, indeed, Relect. Prin. fid. Doctrine, cont. 4. Q. 1. Art. 3.
restricteth it to the Ceremonial Law only; but Moses makes it a Law as large,
v. 2. as the word which God Commands: And, as (says he) v. 5. the statutes
and the judgments which the Lord Commanded me, v. 8. All this Law, Deuteronomy. 31.
9. This written Law delivered to the Priests and kept in the Ark, the Law that
all Israel heard read, v. 11. Of which it is said, v. 24. When Moses had made
an end of writing of the words of this Law in a Book, until they were
finished. Now this was the whole five Books of Moses: And were there nothing of
Church Government in Moses Law? What shall we then say of the High Priest, his
calling, Office, habit, of the Priests, Levites, their charge, calling, attire,
of the Law of the Leaper, his healing, his extrusion out of the Camp, of the
Law of those that were defiled with the dead, of their qualification who were
to be Circumcised, who were to eat the Passover, or who not, who were to enter
into the house of God, and Congregation, who not; not a few of these, touching
Church Government, are included in the Law that God Commanded Israel, as their
wisdom. 4. That there were many additions made to the service of God in the
Temple, not mentioned by Moses, is nothing to purpose, except it be proved that
these additions were made by the Church, without any word of God, the contrary
whereof is evident, for the Temple and whole pattern thereof, was delivered in
writing by the Lord to David, 1 Chronicles. 28. 11. 19. If Formalists will have no
Laws made but by Moses, as the only Lawgiver, they have as good reason to say,
That Moses was the only Canonick writer, and none but he, which is absurd. Or,
2. That Moses by his own spirit was a Lawgiver, and had active influence in
excogitating the Law; We conceive that Protestants are to own this Doctrine,
which Tostatus imputes to us as Heretics, Com. in Loc. Q. 2. Quasi Moses nudus
minister and relator verborum (dti) Moses and Canonick writers, are not
Lawgivers under God, but organs of God in writing, and mere reporters of the
Law of God.
esset, and non legem conderet: As if Moses were a mere servant, and a naked
reporter of the Lords Law and words, and not a Lawmakers. For in the making of
Laws and Divine institutions, we judge that all the Canonick writers were mere
patients, as the people are; for God is the Commander, and Moses the person
Commanded, and a mere servant, Deuteronomy. 4. 5. Mal. 4. 4. Heb. 3. 3, 4, 5. And
Moses and all Canonick writers were only to receive the word at Gods mouth, and
to hear it, Ezekiel. 3. 8. As mere servants; and in this the Church of Prophets
and of Apostles, and the Church that now is, were alike: I know no Authority of
the one above the other. Indeed, in writing and relating to the Church, the
will of God, and the Scriptures; Canonick writers are agents inspired with the
Holy spirit, immediately breathing on them in Prophesying and in writing
Scripture. But the Proclaimer of a Law, as such has no influence in making the
Law: Let it be also remembered, that as Papists Papists say, that the Chrch is
limited in making Ceremonies, both in matter and number, and so do Forma lists.
say two things to the place, so do Formalists. 1. That it is not against
Ceremonies. 2. That the Church is limited in making Ceremonies beside the Word,
that they may not make them too numerous and burdensome: This I make good in
the words of a famous Jesuit, who cites the words of a Learned Papist,
approving them.

Lorinus, Coment. in Loc. Refellit idem Oleaster Hereticos hinc inserentes
institui, non, posse Ceremonias ac ritus novos circa cultum dei: Quam vis ipse
optat moderationem in preceptis ac censuris, ut facilius and suavius possint
servari: To whom I oppose that golden sentence of a man, endued with the spirit
of God above any Papist. Calvin. Com. in Deuteronomy. 4. v. 2. Insignis locus, quo
aperte damnatur quicquid hominum ingenio excogitari potest. Ibid. Quoniam
preposter a lascivia rapitur totus fere mundus ad cultus fictitios, qui tamen
precise une verbo damnantur, ubi deus ita jubet suos acquiescere positae legi,
ne justiores esse appetant, quam illic docentur. All Worship is precisely
condemned here, or any thing devised about the Worship by the wit of men. I
would here meet with a Grand exception of Mr. Hooker, Eccles. Polic. 3. Book,
page 111. Their distinction of matters of substance, and of circumstance,
though true, will not serve; for be they great things, or be they small, if God
have Commanded them in the Gospel, and (if) his Commanding them in the Gospel
do make them unchangeable, there is no reason that we should change the one
more then the other; if the authority of the maker do prove their
unchangeablenesse which God has made, then must all Laws which he has made,
be necessarily for ever permanent, though they be but of circumstances only,
and not of Substance.

Ans. 1. Our distinction of matters of substance and circumstance rightly
taken, will serve the turn: But the mistake is, in that 1. Many things are but
circumstances of worship, such as are Positives and Religious significant
Ceremonies to Formalists, that are not so to us, for to wear a surplice in
sacrificing to Jupiter, were to make the Act of wearing that Religious habit,
an act of Religious honoring of Jupiter, but to wear Surplice and to sacrifice
in that habit to Jupiter at eight of clock in the morning, rather then at ten,
in this place Physical, rather then this, is no worshipping of Jupiter, but a
mere Physical circumstance, neither up, nor down to the worship, and time and
place Physical, are neither worship, nor Religious means of worship: 2. Time,
and Place, Name, Country, Form, Figure, Habit or Garments, to hold off injuries
of Sun and Heaven as such ^re never commanded, never forbidden of God, and
therefore the change of these circumstances can be no change of a Commandment
of God: We never advanced circumstances, as such to the orb and sphere of
Morals; Formalists do so advance their Ceremonies, and therefore if God command
Surplice, though by the intervening authority of his Church, such cannot be
altered, except God command to alter the Religious signification of white
linen, but we know not where God has commanded the alteration of any
Ceremonies, except that, the Lords coming in the flesh, as a thing to come,
must alter all Ceremonies which shadow forth Christ to come, when the body
Christ is come already: Let us know such a ground for alteration of corner Cap,
Altar, Surplice, except to drive such Oxen out of the Temple. 3. We hold that
the Lords commanding such a thing in the Gospel, is a reason why it should be
necessarily permanent for ever, except the Lord has commanded it should be for
a time only, as he commanded Moses's Ceremonies, and so Gods Authority of
commanding a thing to be unchangeably in his worship, is a reason why it should
be unchangeably in his worship; and his commanding any thing to be for a time
only, and alterably in his worship, is a reason why it should be for a time
only, and alterably in his worship; so to us Gods Commandment is a reason, why
his own Ceremonies and Sacraments of the New Testament should be in the Church,
because the Lawgiver has in scripture commanded them to be: and the reason
why Hookers surplice and crossing should not be, is because he has commanded
no such thing: Now the reasons of alteration of any Laws in the Gospel, is from
God, never from the Church: as 1. If God immediately inspire Moses to make a
tabernacle, and thereafter inspire David and Solomon to make the Temple in the
place of the tabernacle, and give them no Commandment for a tabernacle, its
evident that God has altered and removed the Tabernacle, and that the
alteration is not from David nor Solomon: 2. If God command types and
Ceremonies to be in his Church, till the body Christ come, Col. 2. 17. then
when Christ is come, and his coming sufficiently published to the world, then
are his own Ceremonies altered, and removed; but not by Four ways positives
are alterable by God only.
the discretion of Peter and Paul, or the Church, but by God himself. 3. When
God commands such Offices to be in his house, which depends immediately
upon his own immediate will of giving gifts essentially required to these
Offices, then these offices are so long in his Church, as God is pleased by his
immediate will to give these gifts; and when God denies these gifts
essentially requisite, sure it is, his immediate will has altered and removed
the office, not the will of the Church, so the Lord has alterd and removed
these Offices and gifts of Apostles, who could speak with tongues, and seal
their doctrine with Miracles, Evangelists, Prophets extraordinarily inspired,
gifts of healing, etc. 4. Some things are not matters of worship at all, but of
goods, as the community of goods, Love Feasts, All things though never so small,
are a like unalterable, if they be stamped with Gods authority* speaking in the
Scripture.
matters of civil conversation, these are only in their morality, as touching
distribution to the necessities of the Saints, and brotherly kindness,
unalterable, and no otherwise.

Now for these things that are smaller or weightier, we hold they are not in
their weightinesse or smallness of importance to be considered, but as the
Authority of God has imprinted a necessity on them, so are they obligatory to
us: I am obliged to receive this as scripture, that Paul left his cloak at
Troas; no less then this, Christ came into the world to save sinners, in
regard of Canonical authority stamped upon both: R. Hooker with other
Formalists, Will have the lightness of matter to make the Law alterable: Truly
to eat of the Tree of knowledge of good and ill, being put in the balance with
the love of God in it self, is but a light thing; yet the breach of that Law
involved all the world in condemnation.

And what else is this, but that which Papists say, that there be two sort of
things in scripture? so says Cornelius a Lapide Comem. on 2 Timothy 3. 16. 1. The
Law and the Prophets, these God revealed and dyted to Moses and the Prophets;
but there are other things in Scripture, as Histories and moral exhortations,
which Canonick writers learned either by hearing, seeing, reading or
meditation, there was no need these should be dyted, by the inspiration of the
holy Spirit, for they know them themselves, though they were assisted: 2.
Excited by the holy spirit to write; Conceptum, and memoriam eorum quae
sciebant, non iis suggessit spiritus sanctus, sed inspiravit ut hunc potius
conceptum, quam illum scriberent, and omnes eorum sententias and conceptus
ordinavit, digessit, and direxit spiritus sanctus, v. g. Vt hanc sententiam
primo, illam secundo, aliam tertio collocarent: Yet Estius says on the place,
The Scriptures are given by divine inspiration, ita ut non solum sententiae,
sed and verba singula and verborum ordo, ac tota dispositio fit a deo, tanquam
per seipsum loquente ac* scribente: So as not only the sentences, but every
word, and the order and disposition of words is of, or from God, as if he were
speaking and writing himself.

Now for the additions Canonical, that the Prophets and Apostles By what
authority Canonical additions of the Prophets and Apostles were added to the
Books of Moses.
made to the writing of Moses: I hope Papists and Formalists cannot with any
forehead allege them, to prove that the Church may add Traditions, and
alterable Positives of Church-Policy to the written word of God, except upon
the same ground, they conclude, That the Church now has the same immediately
inspired spirit, that the Prophets and Apostles had, and that our Prelates saw
the visions of God, when they saw but the visiones aulae; the visions of Court,
and that their calling was, as Paul's was, Gal. 1. 1. not of men, neither by
men, but by Jesus Christ: When as it is not by Divine right, and was both of
the King, and by Court: 2. Except they infer that the Church that now is, may
add Canonical and Scripturall additions to the Scripture; for such additions
the Prophets and Apostles added to the writings of Moses: and 3. that that
precept, Thou shall not add, etc. was given to the Lord himself to bind up
his hands, that no Canonick Scripture should ever be, but the only writings of
Moses, which is (as some write) the dream of Saduces, whereas inhibition is
given to the Church of God, not to God himself, for what the Prophets and
Apostles added, God himself added; yea, to me it is a doubt (while I be better
informed) if the Lord did ever give any power of adding to his Scripture at
all, without his own immediate inspiration, to either Prophet or Apostle; or
that God did never command Moses, or Prophet or Apostle to write Canonick
Scripture of their own head, or that his Commandment to write Scripture, was
any other then an immediate inspiration, which essentially did include every
syllable and word that the Apostles and Prophets were to write: For I do not
coaceive, that 1. God gave to Apostles and Prophets power to devise a Gospel
and write it: I suppose Angels or men could not have devised it; yea, that they
could no more have devised the very Law of nature, then they could create such
a piece, as a reasonable soul, which to me is a rare and curious book, on which
essentially is written by the immediate finger of God, that natural Theology,
that we had in our first creation. 2. I do not conceive, that as Princes and
Canonick writers how immediately led by God.
Nobles do give the Contents, or rude thoughts of a curious Epistle to a
Foreign Prince, to their Secretary, and go to bed and sleep, and leaves it to
the wit and eloquence of the Secretary, to put it in form and style, and then
signs it, and seals it without any more ado; so the Lord gave the rude
draughts of Law and Gospel, and all the pins of Tabernacle and Temple,
Church Officers, and Government, and left it to the wit and eloquence of
Shepherds, Heardsmen, Fishers, such as were the Prophets, Moses, David, Amos;
and Peter and diverse of the Apostles, who were unlettered men, to write words
and style as they pleased, but that in writing every jot, tittle, or word of
Scripture, they were immediately inspired, as touching the matter, words,
phrases, expression, order, method, majesty, style and all: So I think they
were but Organs, the mouth, pen and Amanuenses; God as it were, immediately
dyting, and leading their hand at the pen, Deuteronomy 4. 5. Deuteronomy. 31. 24, 25, 26.
Mal. 4. 4. 2 Pet. 1. 19. 20, 21. 2 Timothy 3. 16. Gal. 1. 11, 12. 1 Cor. 11. 23.
so Luke 1. 70. God borrowed the mouth of the Prophets; As he spoke by the mouth
of his holy Prophets, which has been since the world began: Now when we ask
from Prelates what sort of additionall, or accidental worship, touching
Surplice, Cross, and other Religious Positives of Church* Policy, it is, that
they are warranted to add to the word, and how they are distinguished from
Scriptures, Doctrinals: They give us these Characters of it, 1. God is the
Author of Doctrinals, and has expressed them fully in scripture: But the The
Characters of Formalists, Ceremonies, and Papists Traditions one and the same.
Church is the Author of their Accidentals, and this is essential to it, that
it is not specified particularly in scripture, as Bread and Wine, Taking and
Eating in the Lords Supper is; for then it should be a Doctrinall point, and
not Accidental. 2. It is not in the particular a point of faith and manners,
as Doctrinals are: But hear the very Language of Papists; for Papists puts
this essential Character on their Tradition, that it is not written, but by
word of mouth derived from the Apostles, and so distinguished from the written
word; for if it were written in scripture, it should not be a Tradition.

So the Jesuit Malderus, in 22. tom. de virtut. de obj. fidei Q. 1. Dub. 3. Pro
Apostolica traditione habendum est, quod eum non inveneatur in Divinis literis,
tamen Vniversa tenet ecclesia, nec consiliis institutum, sed semper retentum 2.
That the Traditions are necessary, and how far Papists do clear, as I have
before said; for the Church may coin no Articles of faith, these are all in
Scripture. For the Jews two Suppers, and their additions to the passover, as
Hooker says, and their fasting till the sixth hour every Feast day, we reject
as dreams, because they are not warranted by any word of institution; not to
add, that the Church of the Jews never took on them to command the observation
of these forgeries, under the pain of Church Censures, as Papists and prelates
did their Crossing and their Surplice.

Hooker says, A Question it is, whither containing in Scripture, 1 Book,
eccles. Pol. p. 42.
do import express setting down in plain terms, or else comprehending in such
sort, that by reason, we may thence conclude all things which are necessary to
salvation. The Faith of the Trinity, the Co-eternity of the Son with the
Father, are not the former way in Scripture; for the other, let us not think,
that as long as the World does endure, the wit of man shall be able to sound to
the bottom of that which may be concluded out of Scripture. -- Traditions we do
not reject, because they are not Page 44.
in Scripture; but because they are neither in Scripture, nor can otherwise
sufficiently, by any reason, be proved to be of God. That which is of God, and
may be evidently proved to be so, we deny not; but it has in its kind,
although unwritten, yet the self same force and authority with the Written Laws
of God. -- Such as are alterable Rites and Cystomes, for being Apostolical, it
is not the manner of delivering them to the Church; but the Author from whom
they proceed, which gave them their force and credit.

Ans. 1. The consequences of Scriptures are doublesse many, and What is it to
be contained in Scripture, and how far it makes any thing unlawful according
to Hooker.
more then are known to us, and the particulars of that Government that we
contend for, are in Scripture, that is, there should be no Government, but what
is either expressly in Scripture, or may be made our, by just consequence, we
believe, if they cannot be proved from Scripture, let them fall as men's hay and
stubble. But in the mean time, these are two different questions: Whither there
be an immutable Platform of Discipline in the Word? Or whither ours be the only
Platform and no other? If we carry the first, Ceremonies must fall. And
certainly, in all reason, we are on the surest side: If we cannot observe all
that is written, it is not like that God has laid upon us unwritten burdens.
2. Hooker does not reject all the Popish Traditions, as our Divines Reformed
do; because they are not warranted by the Word; so, that if the Images of God
and Christ, and the Worshipping of them, and Purgatory, and the Supremacy of
the Pope, can be proved to be of God, though they be no more in Scripture, then
Crossing and Surplice; then would he receive all these, as Having the self same
force and authority with the Written Laws. Now we know no other weightier
Argument to prove there is no Purgatory, but because the scripture speaks of
Heaven and Hell, and is silent of Purgatory. 2. That natural reason can
warrant a positive instituted Worship, such as Surplice, betokening Pastoral
Holiness, without any Scripture, is a great untruth* for natural reason may
warrant new Sacraments, as well as new Sacramentals. 3. If Traditions have
their force and credit from God, not from the manner of delivering them, that
is, from being contained in scripture, or not contained in it; then certainly
they must be of the same Divine necessity with scripture: For whither Christ
Command that the Baereans believe in the Messiah, by the Vocal Preaching of
Paul, or by the written scriptures of the Prophets and Apostles, it is all one,
it is the same word, and coming from Christ, must be of the same Divine
authority: But this is to beg the question, for that we are to believe no
unwritten tradition; because it is unwritten, to have the self same force and
authority with the Written Laws of God. For Lorinus, Cornelius a Lapide, Com.
in 4. Deuter. Estius, Com. in. 2. These 2. 15. Bellarmine, Tannerus, Malderus,
Becanus, say, Whither the Lord deliver his mind to us in his Written
Scripture, or by Tradition, it is still the Word of God, and has authority
from God. But the truth is, to us it is not the Word of God, if it be not a
part of the Counsel of God written in Moses, or the Prophets and Apostles; for
though the Word have authority only from God, not from the Church, nor from
men, or the manner of delivering of it, by word or writ; yet we with the
Fathers and Protestant Divines, and evidence of scripture, stand to that The
Fathers teach that all things in Worship, are to be rejected that are no^ in
scripture
of Basilius, Homil. 29. Advers. c^l^mnian^es. S. Trinit. (...); Believe what

decent and significant) may be fully confirmed, and these that are evil,
corfounded: And to us, for our Faith and practice, if it be not Law and
Testimony, it is darkness, and not light. And as Gregor. Nyssen. the Brother
of Basyl says, Dialog. de anim. et Resurrect. tom. 2. ed. Grecola^. page 639.
Edit. Gre^. page 325. That only must be acknowledged for truth, in which is the

are your Positives of men's devising) how shall we receive it, and account it,
amongst things that are true? And it is not that which Heretics of old said,
for their Heresies to say (^s Hooker does) that any thing may be proved to be
of God, which is not written in Scripture: For says Hieronimus, in Hag. c. 1.
Sed and alia quae absque authoritate and testimoniis Scripturarum, quasi
Traditione Apostolica sponte reperiunt atque confingunt, percutit Gladius dei.
The Scripture does bar the door upon Heretics, says Chrysostom, -- And he is

(...).
the Scripture. And by what Argument can reason without Scripture prove that
Cross and Suplice are of God: But by that same reason, Papists without
Scripture, can, and may prove their Traditions to be of God? And if we admit
reason, and exclude Scripture, it is as easy to prove their Traditions, as our
Positive additions to Worship: And what Answers Papists give for their
Traditions, to ^lude the power of Scripture, and evidence of Testimonies of
fathers, all these same are given by Prelates for their additions; to say
nothing that Hooker asserteth unwritten Traditions to be Gods Word; and in the
very style of the Council of Trent, we are to acknowledge Traditions, though
unwritten, yet to have the self same authority and force with the Written Laws
of God. And shall the Surplice and Cross Concilen* Tridenti. c. 1. Sess. 4.
Synodus traditiones ^ine scripto, atque scripturam paripictat is affectu, ac
reverentia suscipit ac veneratur. Ibib. p. 46.
and such stuff, be of the self same force and authority with the Evangel
according to Luke and John: But what wonder? For Hooker holds, that we have
no other way to know the scripture to be the Word of God, but by Tradition,
which Popish Assertion holden by him and Chillingworth, to me, is to make the
Traditions of men the object of our Faith.

Hooker: About things easy and manifest to all men by Common sense, there
needs no higher Consultation, because a man whose wisdom is for weighty
affairs admired, would take it in some disdain to have his Counsel solemnly
asked about a toy; so the meannesse of some things is such, that to search the
Scriptures of God for the ordering of them, were to derogate from the Reverend
Authority of the Scripture, no less then they do, by whom Scriptures are in
ordinary talking very idely applied unto vain and Childish trifles.

Ans. 1. It is a vain comparison to resemble God to an earthly wise It
derogateth nothing from the honor of God in Scripture. that he be consulted in
the meanest things.
man in this; for a King of Kings, such as Artaxerxes, if he were building a
stately Palace for his Honor and Magnificence, would commit the drawing of it,
the frame, the small pins, rings, bowls, to the wisdom of a Master of work,
skilled in the Mathematics, and not trouble his own Princely head with every
small pin; but this is because he is a man, and comes short of the wisdom,
skill, and learning of his servants. 2. Because, how his Honor and
Magnificence be declared in every small pin of that Palace, is a business that
takes not much up the thoughts of a stately Prince. The contrary of both these
are true in the Lord our God, his wisdom is above the wisdom of Moses, and
Moses cannot frame a Tabernacle or a Temple for Gods Honor in the least pin or
s^uffer, with such wisdom as the only wise God can do. 2. The Lord is more
jealous and tender of his own Honor, in the means and smallest way of
Illustrating of it: Yea, in the smallest Pin, then earthly Princes are, for
earthly Princes may Communicate with their inferiors the glory of curious
works set forth, as speaking monuments of their honor; the Lord who will not
give his glory to another; never did communicate the glory of devising worship,
or the Religious means of worshipping and honoring his glorious Majesty to
men. 2. God has thus ^ar condiscended in his wisdom, to speak particularly in
written Oracles of every Pin, Ring, tittle, Officer of his house, of every
Sign, Sacrament, Sacramental never so mean and small; Ergo, It is no
derogation from the dignity of Scripture, to have a mouth to ask counsel,
where God has opened his mouth to give Counsel in written Oracles: 3. There
is nothing positive in Gods worship so small, as that we may dare to take on us
to devise it of our own head. 4. Hooker contradicts himself; he said the
Ceremonies have their authority from God, and though unwritten have the self
same force and authority with the written Laws of God, page 44. Here he will
have the unwritten positives so small and far inferior to written Scripture,
that to ask for scripture to warrant such small toys, is to derogate from the
reverend Authority and Dignity of the Scripture: so Ceremonies page 46. are but
Toys, unworthy to be written with Scripture, but p. 44. They have the self
same force and authority with written Scripture.

Hooker. It is unpossible to be proved, that only the School of Christ Hooker
l. 2. p. 60.
in his word is able to resolve us, what is good and evil: for what if it were
true concerning things indifferent, that unless the word of the Lord had
determined of the free use of them, there could have been no Lawful use of
them at all, which notwithstanding is untrue; because it is not the Scriptures
setting down things indifferent, but their not setting them down as necessary,
that does make them to be indifferent.

Ans. Then because the scripture has not forbidden the killing How things are
in Scripture.
of our children to God, as a ^alse worship against the second Commandment, but
only as an act of Homicide against the sixth Commandment, and has not
forbidden all the Jewish Ceremonies, so they have a new signification to point
forth Christ already come in the flesh, these must all be indifferent: For let
Formalists give me a Scripture to prove, that Circumcision, killing of
Children, sacrificing of Beasts, are any ways forbidden in this notion, but in
that they are not commanded, or set down in the word as not necessary? 2. Such
Divinity I have not read; That only the School of Christ is not able to
resolve us what is good and evil: I mean Morally good and evil. For Hooker page
54. Book 2. says, The controversy would end, in which we contend, that all
our actions are ruled by the word: If 1. we would keep our selves within the
compass of moral actions, actions which have in them vice or virtue: 2. If we
would not exact at their hands for every action, the knowledge of some place
of Scripture, out of which we must stand bound to deduce it. Then it is like
the School of Christ, the word can and does teach us, what is a Moral action
good or ill, an action in which there is virtue or vice; and to me it is a
wonder, that the Old and New Testament, which contains an exact systeme and
body of all Morals, whither natural or Civil, or supernatural, should not be
the only rule of all Morals.

Now I find that Mr. Hooker says two things to this; 1. That Scripture does
regulate all our Moral actions but not scripture only, Page 56.
for the Law of nature, and the most concealed instincts of nature, and other
principles may vvarrant our actions: We move, (says he) we sleep, we take the
Cup at the hand of our friend; a number of things we often do, only to
satisfy some natural desire, without present express and actual reference
to any Commandment of God; unto his glory, even these things are done which
we naturally perform, and not only that which naturally and spiritually we
do, for by every effect proceeding from the most concealed instincts of nature,
his power is made manifest. But it does not therefore follovv, that of
necessity we shall sin, unless we expressly intend the glory of God, in every
such particular. Some actions super naturally moral, some moral naturally or
civilly, others are mixed.


Ans. I speak of these more distinctly hereafter, here I answer, that as there
be some actions in man purely and spiritually, but supernaturally moral, as to
believe in Christ for Remission of sins, to love God in Christ: These the
Gospel does regulate. 2. There be some actions naturally moral in the
substance of the act, as many things commanded, and forbidden in the Moral
Law; and these are to be regulated by the Law of nature and the Moral Law: 3.
There be some actions mixed, as such actions in which nature, or concealed
instincts of nature are the chief principles, yet in, and about these actions,
as in their modification of time, place, and manner, and measure, there is a
special morality, in regard of which they are to be ruled by the word, such
mixed actions as these, that are mentioned by Hooker, As to move, sleep, take
the cup at the hand of a friend, cannot be called simply moral, for to move
may be purely natural, as if a man against his will fall off a high place, or
off a horse, to start in the sleep are so natural, that I know not any
morality in them; but sure I am, for Nathaniel to come to Christ, which was
also done by a natural motion, is not a mere natural action, proceeding from
the most concealed instincts of nature; so to sleep has somewhat natural in
it, for beasts do sleep, beasts do move; I grant they cannot take a cup at the
hand of a friend, they cannot salute one another: (It is Hookers instance) but
fancy sometimes in men do these, whereas conscience should do them: What is
natural in moving and sleeping, and what is common to men with beasts, I
grant, Scripture does not direct or regulate these acts of moving and sleeping;
we grant actions natural and common to us, with beasts, need not the rule of
the Word to regulate them: But this I must say (I speak it, my Record is in
Heaven, not to offend any) Formalists, as such, and as Prelaticall, are
irreligious and Profane: One of them asked a godly man, Will you have Scripture
for giving your horse a peck of Oats, and for breaking wind, and easing or
obeying nature? And therefore they bring in these instances to make sport: But
I conceive, sleeping moderately, to enable you to the service of God, as
eating, drinking, that God may be glorified, 1 Cor. 10. 31. are also in the
measure, and manner of doing, Moral, and so ruled by Scripture, and Scripture
only, and not regulated by natural instincts: But what is all this to the
purpose? are Surplice, Crossing, Saints-dayes, such actions as are common to us
with beasts, as moving and sleeping are? Or is there no more need that the
Prelate be regulated in wearing his corner-Cap, his Surplice in Crossing, Some
habitual reference to Scripture is required in all our Moral actions.
then a beast is to be ruled by Scripture in moving, in sleeping, in eating
grass?

2. Express and actual reference and intention to every Commandment of God,
or to Gods glory in every particular action; I do not urge, a habitual
reference and intention I conceive is holden forth to us in Scripture: 1 Cor.
10. 31. 3. God by every effect, proceeding from the most concealed instinct of
nature is made manifest in his power. What then? the power of God is manifest
in the Swallows building her nest; Ergo, neither the Swallow in building her
nest, nor the Prelate in Crossing an Infant in Baptism to dedicate him to
Christ, have need of any express or actual reference to any Commandment of
God or Gods glory: Truly, it is a vain consequence in the latter part, except
Hooker make Surplice, Crossing, and all the mutable Frame of Church Government
to proceed from the most concealed instincts of nature, which shall be n^w
Divinity to both Protestants and Papists: And I pray you, what power of God is
manifest in a Surplice? I conceive it is a strong Argument against this mutable
frame of Government, that it is not in the power of men to devise, what
Positive signs they please, without the word to manifest the power, wisdom and
other attributes of God: For what other thing does the two Books opened to us,
Psalm. 19. The Book of Creation and Providence; and the Book of the Scripture,
but manifest God in his nature and works, and man's misery and Redemption in
Christ?

Now the Prelates and Papists devise a third blanke book of unwritten Traditions
and mutable Ceremonials* We see no Warrant for this book: 4. Hooker makes a
man in many Moral Actions, as in wearing a Surplice, in many actions flowing
from concealed instincts of nature, as in moving, sleeping, like either the
Philosophers, Civilian or Moral Athiest, or like a beast to act things, or to
do by the mere instinct of nature. Whereas being created according to Gods
Image, especially, he living in the visible Church, he is to do all his actions
deliberate, even natural and moral in Faith, and with a Warrant from
scripture, to make good their Morality, Psa. 119. 9. Prove. 3. 23, 24. 2 Cor. 5.
7. And truly Formalists give men in their Morals to live at random, and to
walk, without taking heed to their ways, according to Gods word.

Hooker. It suffices that our Moral actions be framed, according Book ^.
Eccl. pol. p. 54.
to the Law of reason; the general axioms, rules, and principles of which
being so frequent in holy Scripture, there is no let, but in that regard, oven
out of Scripture, such duties may be deduced by some kind of consequence (as
by long circuit of deduction it may be, that even all truth out of any truth
may be concluded) howbeit no man be bound in such sort to deduce all his
actions out of Scripture, as if either the place be to him unknown, whereon
they may be concluded, or the reference to that place, not presently considered
of, the action shall in that be condemned as unlawful.

Ans. 1. The Law of reason in Morals (for of such we now speak) is nothing but
the Moral Law and will of God, contained fully in the Scriptures of the Old
and New Testament; and therefore is not to be divided from the Scriptures; if a
man be ruled in that, he is ruled by Scripture: for a great part of the Bible,
of the Decalogue, is Printed in the reasonable soul* of man: As when he loves
his Parents, obeys his superiors, saves his Neighbor in extreme danger of
death, because he does these according to the Law of Reason, shall it follow
that these actions which are expressly called (...), Romans 2. 14. the things or
duties of the Law, are not warranted by express Scripture, because they are
done according to the Law of natural reason? I should think the contrary most
true. 2. Such duties (says he) Moral duties (I hope he must mean) to God and
our Neighbor, may be deduced by some kind of consequence out of Scripture:
But by what consequence? Such as to Argue, Quidlibet ex quolibet. The
Catechism taught me long ago of duties to God and my Neighbor, that they are
taught in the ten Commandments. Now if some Moral duties to God and man be
taught in the ten Commandments, and some not taught there: 1. Who made this
distinction of duties? None surely but the Prelates and the Papists; if the
Scripture warrant some duties to God and our Neighbor, and do not warrant
some, the Scripture must be unperfect. 2. The warranting of actions that may be
service to God, or will worship, or homicide by no better ground then Surplice
and Cross, can be warranted, or by such a consequence, as you may deduce all
truth out of any truth, is no warrant at all; the Traditions of Papists may
thus be warranted. 3. Nor is the action to be condemned, as unlawful in it
self, because the agent cannot see by what consequence it is warranted by
Scripture, it follows only to him that so does, it is unlawful, Romans 14. 14.
In that he does Bonum, non been, a thing lawful, not lawfully. 4. It is
unpossible to deduce all truth out of any truth: For then because the Sun
rises to day, it should follow, Ergo, Cross and Surplice are Lawful: I might
as well deduce the contrary, Ergo, they are unlawful.

Hooker: Some things are good in so mean a degree of goodness, 2. Book. p. 78.
that men are only not disproved, nor disallowed of God for them, as, Ephesians. 5.
20. No man hates his own flesh, Matthew. 5. 46. If ye do good unto them that do
so to you, the very Publicans themselves do as much: They are worse then
Infidels that provide not for their own, 1. Tim. 5. 8. The light of nature
alone, makes these actions in the sight of God allowable. 2. Some things are
required to salvation by way of direct, immediate and proper necessity final,
so that without performance of them, we cannot in ordinary course be saved. --
In these, our chiefest direction is from Scipture, for nature is no sufficient
director what we should do to attain life Eternal. 3. Some things although not
so required of necessity, that to leave them undone excludes from salvation,
are yet of so great dignity and acceptance with God, that most ample reward is
laid up in Heaven for them, as Matthew. 10. A Cup of cold Water shall not go
unrewarded: And the first Christians sold their possessions, and 1 Thessalonians. 2. 7.
9. Paul would not be burdensome to the Thessalonians: Hence nothing can be evil
that God approves, and he approves much more then he does Command, and the
precepts of the law of Nature may be otherwise known then by the Scripture,
then the bare mandat of Scripture is not the only rule of all good and evil, in
the actions of Moral men.

Ans. 1. The Popery in this Author (in disputing for a Platform of Government)
that is up and down, and changeable at the will of men, made me first out of
love with their way: for his first class of things allowable by the light of
Nature without Scripture, is far wide; for Ephesians. 5. 20. That a man love his own
flesh, is Commanded in the sixth Commandment, and the contrary forbidden:
otherwise for a man to kill himself, which is self-hatred, should not be
forbidden in Scripture, the very light of nature alone will forbid ungratitude
in Publicans, and condemn a man that provideth not for his own: But that this
light of nature excludes Scripture and the Doctrine of Faith, is an untruth:
for Hooker leaves out the words that are in the Text, and most against his
cause: He that provideth not for his own, is worse then an Infidel, and has
denied the Faith: Ergo, the Doctrine of Faith commands a man to provide for
his own. What Moral goodness nature teaches, that same does the Moral Law
teach, so the one excludes not the other. 2. It is false, that Scripture only
as con^adistinguished from the Law of Nature, does direct us to Heaven: for
both concurreth in a special manner, nor is the one exclusive of the other. 3.
For his third class its expressly the Popish Works of supererogation, of which
Hooker and Papists both give two Characters. 1. That they are not Commanded 2.
That they merit a greater degree of glory: Both Works of Superogation holden by
Hooker.
are false: To give a Cup of cold water to a needy Disciple, is commanded in
Scripture, Isa. 57. 9, 10. Matthew. 25. 41, 42. And the contrary punished with
everlasting fire in Hell: For Paul not to be burdensome to the Thessalonians,
and not to take stipend or wages for Preaching, is commanded, for considering
the condition that Paul was in, was, 1 Thessalonians. 2. 6. To seek glory of men, was a
thing forbidden in Scripture, and so the contrary cannot be a thing not
commanded; and not to be gentle, v. 7. As the servant of God ought to be, even
to the enemies of the truth, 1 Timothy 2. 24. Not to be affectionately desirous to
impart soul and Gospel and all, to those to whom he Preached, as it is v. 8. is
a sin forbidden, and for the merit of increase of glory, it is a dream. Hence I
draw an Argument against this mutable form of Government: The changeable
Positives of this Government, such as Crossing, Surplice and the like, are none
of these three enumerated by Hooker. 1. They are not warranted by the Law of
nature, for then all Nations should know by the light of nature, that God is
decently worshipped in Cross and linen Surplice, which is against experience.
2. That these Positives are not necessary to salvation, with a proper final
necessity, as I take, is granted by all. 3. I think Cross and Surplice, cannot
deserve a greater measure of glory: for Formalists deny either merit or
efficacy to their Positives. The Jesuit Tannerus, confirms all which is said
by Hooker, as did Aquinas before him: And E^ki^s in his conference with Luther,

and their Traditions; that it is sufficient that the Church say such a thing
is truth and to be done, and the scripture does not gainsay it.

SECT. V.
Moral Obedience resolved ultimately in Scripture.

FOR farther light in this point, it is a Question: What is the formal object
of our obedience in all our our Moral actions? that is, Whether is the Faith
practical of our obedience, and the obedience itself, in all the externals of
Church Government resolved in this ultimately and finally. This and this we do,
and this point of Government Whither our obedience in Churchpolicy, be
ultimately resolved in this says the Lord, or in this says the church.
we believe and practice: because the Lord has so appointed it, in an
immutable Platform of Government in Scripture: or because the Church has so
appointed, or because there is an intrinsecall convenience in the thing it
self, which is discernable by the light of nature? Ans. This Question is near
of blood to the Controversy between Papists and us, concerning the formal
object of our faith* that is, Whither are we to believe the scripture to be the
Word of God, because so says the Church: or upon this objective ground,
because the Lord so speaks in his own Word: Now we hold, that scripture it
self furnishes light and faith of it self, from it self; and that the Church
does but hold forth the light: as I see the light of the Candle, because of the
light itself, not because of the Candlestick. Hence in this same very Question,
the Jews were not to believe, that the smallest pin of the Tabernacle, or that
any officer, High Priest, Priest or Levite, were necessary, nor were they to
obey in the smallest Ceremonial observance; because Moses and the Priests or
Church, at their godly discretion, without Gods own special warrant said so:
But, because so the Lord spoke to Moses, so the Lord gave in writing to David
and Solomon, 1 Chronicles. 28. 11. 19. And so must it be in the Church of the New
Testament, in all the Positives of Government; otherwise, if we observe
Saintsdayes, and believe Crossing and Surplice, has this Religious
signification, because the Church says so; then is our obedience of conscience
finally resolved in the Testimony of men so speaking, at their own discretion
without any warrant of scripture. 2. To believe and obey in any Religious
Positives, because it is the pleasure of men so to Command, is to be servants
of men, and to make their will the formal reason of our obedience, which is
unlawful. If it be said, that we are to believe and Practice many things in
natural necessity, as to eat, move, sleep, and many circumstantials of
Church-Policy, because the Law of natural reason says so; and because there
is an intrinsecall convenience, and an aptitude to edify, and to decore and
beautify in an orderly and a decent way the service of God, and not simply,
because the Church says so, nor yet because the Lord speaks so in the
Scripture, and therefore all our obedience is not Ultimately and finally
resolved into the Testimony of the Scripture. I Answer, That there be some
things that the Law of Nature commands, as to move, eat, sleep; and here
with leave I distinguish Factum, the common practice of men from the jus, what
men in conscience ought to do, as concerning the former, moral and natural
men's practice is all resolved in their own carnal will, and lusts, and so they
eat, move and sleep, because nature, and carnal will, leads them thereinto,
not because God in the Law of nature (which I humbly conceive to be a part of
the first elements and principles of the Moral Law, or Decalogue, and so a
part of Scripture) does so warrant us to do; and therefore the moving, eating,
drinking of natural Moralists, are materially lawful and conform to
scripture, for God by the Law of nature commands both Heathen men, and pure
Moralists within the visible Church, to do natural acts of this kind; because
the Lord has revealed that to be his will in the Book of nature: But these
Heathen do these acts, because they are suitable to their Lusts and carnal
will, and not because God has commanded them so to do in the Book of nature;
and this is their sin in the manner of doing though materially, Et quod
substantiam actus, the action be good; and the same is the sin of natural men
within the visible Church, and a greater sin; for God not only commands them
in the Law of nature, but also in Scripture to do all these natural acts,
because God has revealed his will in these natural actions, as they are
moral to natural men within the visible Church, both in the Law of nature,
and in the scripture, and De jure they ought to obey, because God so commands
in both, and in regard all within the visible Church, are obliged to all
natural actions in a spiritual way, though their eating, moving, sleeping be
lawful materially, Et quod substantiam actus, yet because they do them without
any the least habitual reference to God, so commanding in natures Law and
scripture, they are in the manner of doing, sinful; otherwise Formalists go on
with Papists and Arminians to justify the actions of the unregenerated, as
simply Lawful and good, though performed by them with no respect to God or his
Commandment: 2. As concerning actions of Church-Policy, that cannot be
warranted by the light of nature, and yet have intrinsecall convenience and
aptitude to edify and decently to Accomodate the worship of God. I conceive
these may be done, but not because the Church so commands, as if their
commandment were the formal reason of our obedience, but because partly the
light of the Law of reason, partly scripture does warrant them; but that Cross
and Surplice can be thus warranted is utterly denied: Again I conceive that
there be two sort of positives in the externals of Government or worship: 1.
Some Divine, as that there be in the Public Worship, Prayers, Praising,
Preaching, Sacraments, and these are substantials; that there be such Officers,
Pastors, Teachers, Elders and Deacons; that there be such censures, as
rebuking, Excommunication and the like, are morally Divine, or Divinely Moral:
and when the Church forms a Directory for worship and Government, the
Directory it self is in the Form not simply Divine. And if it be said that
neither the Church of the Jews, nor the Church Apostolic had more a written
Directory, nor Two things in the external worship. 1. Substantials. 2.
Accidentals.
they had a written Leiturgy or book of Common Prayers or Public
Church Service: I answer, nor had either the Jewish or Apostolic Church any
written Creed or systeme, written of fundamental Articles, such as is that,
which is commonly called the Apostolic Creed; but they had materially in the
scripture the Apostolic Creed; and the Directory they had also the same way,
for they practiced all the Ordinances directed, though they had no written
Directory in a formal contexture or frame: for Prayers, Preaching, Praising,
Sacraments and Censures never Church wanted in some one order or other* though
we cannot say that the Apostolic Church had this same very order and form:
But a Leiturgy which is a commanded, imposed, stinted Form, in such words and
no other, is another thing then a Directory as an unlawful thing is different
from a Lawful: 2. There be some things Positive humane, as the Ordering of
some parts, or worship, or Prayer, the form of words or phrases, and some
things of the Circumstantials of the Sacrament, as what Cups, Wood or Metal,
in these the Directory lays a tie upon no man, nor can the Church in this
make a Directory to be a Church Compulsory to strain men: And this way the
Directory is not ordered and commanded in the frame and contexture, as was the
Service Book; and the Pastor or people in these, are not properly Moral
Agents, nor do we press that scripture should regulate men in these. But sure
in Crossing, in Surplice men must be Moral Agents, no less then in eating and
drinking at the Lord's Supper, and therefore they ought to be as particularly
regulated by Scripture in the one, as in the other.

Quest. But who shall be judge of these things which you say are
Circumstantials only, as time, place, etc. and of these that Formalists say are
adjuncts and Circumstances of worship, though also they have a Symbolicall and
Religious signification: must not the Church judge, what things are
indifferent, what necessary, what are expedient, what Lawful? Answer, There is
no such question imaginable, but in the Synagogue of Antichrist; For as
concerning Norma judi^andi, the Rule of judging, without all exception, the
scripture ought to be the only rule and measure of all practical truths, how
Formalists can make the Scripture the rule of judging of unwritten Ceremonies
which have no warrant in Scripture, more then Papists can admit scripture to
regulate and warrant their unwritten Traditions, I see not, we yield that the
Church is the Politic, Ministerial, and visible judge of things necessary and
The question who should be judge of things necessary or indifferent is nothing
to the present controversy.
expedient, or of things not necessary and expedient: But we know no such
question in this Controversy, as who shall be judge: but supposing the Church
to be a ministerial judge, and the Scripture the infallible Rule, the question
is, whether this judge have any such power, as to prescribe Laws touching
things indifferent, and to injoyne these, though they have no warrant from
Scripture, as things necessary, and to bind where God has not bound.

Quest. But does not the Church determine things, that of themselves are
indifferent; as whether Sermon should begin at nine of clock, or ten in the
morning, and after the Church has past a determination for the diet of ten a
clock, the indifferency of either nine or ten is removed, and the practice
without any warrant of Scripture restricted to one, for order and peace sake;
and why may not the like be done in Positives of Church Government? Ans. The
truth is, the Church by her will puts no determination on the time, but only
ministerially declares that which Gods providence accomodating it self to the
season, climate, the convenience of the congregation as they lie in distance
from the place of meeting, has determined already: But neither Providence,
scripture, nor natural reason has determined, that there should be in every
Diocesan Church a Monarch-Prelate, Pastor of Pastors, with majority of power of
jurisdiction and ordination over Pastors, more then there should be one Pope,
Catholic Pastor of the Catholic visible Church, or that Crossing should
betoken Dedication to Christ's service, only will as will must determine
positive Religious observances, such as these are.

SECT. VI.
What Honor, Praise, Glory, Reverence, Veneration, Devotion, Service, Worship,
etc. are.

FOr the more clear opening of the ensuing Treatise, it is necessary to speak
somewhat of worship and Adoration, and especially of these, 1. Honor. 2.
Praise. 3. Glory, 4. Reverence. 5. Veneration. 1. Honor. 2. Praise. 3. Glory.
4. Reverence. 5. Veneration. 6. Devotion. 7. Religion 8. Service. 9. Worship
10. Love. 11. Adoration, what they are.
6. Devotion. 7. Religion. 8. Service. 9. Worship. 10. Love. 11. Obedience. 12.
Adoration. 1. Honor, is a testification of the excellency of any, Arist.
Ethic. l. 8. c. 8. Aquinas. Honos est signum quoddam excellentiae. Honor is a
sign or expression of Excellency in any, it does not import any superiority in
the party whom we honor, as Adoration does. Praise, is a special honoring of
any, consisting in words. Glory, is formally the effect of Honor, though it be
taken, Pro claritate, for the celebrity or renownednesse of any; yet glory
seems to be founded upon celebrity, as its foundation. Reverence is a sort of
Veneration of a person for excellency connotating a sort of fear. Veneration is
a sort of fear, and reverencing of a person: I see not well any difference
between Reverence and Veneration, except that Veneration seems to be some
more, and comes nearer to Adoration: Devotion is the promptitude,
cheerfulness, or spiritual propension of the will to serve God; Religion is
formally in this, when a man subjecteth himself to God, as to his supreme
Lord, and thence arises to give him honor, as his God, and absolute Lord. The
two integral parts of Religion, are the subjection of the reasonable creature
to God. 2. An exhibition of honor; if any object that the subjection of the
creature to God is humility, not Religion, Raphael de la Torres in 22. tom. 1.
de obj. adorat. q. 81. art. 1. disp. unic. n. 8. answers that subjection to
God, as it issues from a principle of tendering due Honor to God for his
excellency, its Religion; but as it abandoneth the passion of hope in the way
of attaining honor, it is an act of humility to God, as the giving of money
for the paying of debt, is an act of justice; but as it is given to Two acts of
Religion, imperated, or commanded, and elicite*
moderate the desire of money, it is an act of Liberality. The acts of Riligion
are of two sorts, some internal and elicite, as to Adore, Sacrifice, Pray, by
these a man is rightly ordered toward the Honoring of God only: But there be
other acts imperated and Commanded by Religion, which flow immediately from
other virtues, as it may be from mercy and compassion to our brother, but are
Commanded by Religion, as Jam. 1. 27. Pure Religion and undefiled before God
and the Father, is this, to visit the father less and the widows, etc. Service
is from the bond of subjection, to reverence God as an inferior or servant does
his Lord and Master: A servant does properly do the will of his Master, for the
gain or profit that redoundeth to his Master; but, because we cannot be
profitable to the Almighty by way of gain; therefore we are to serve him in
relation to an higher end, then accession of gain (of which the Lord is not
capable, Psalm. 16. 2. Job 22. 3.) For the declaration of his glory: For Worship
formally is to give reverence to God for his excellency; in one and the same
act we may both Worship God and serve him. Only service does include the
obligation of a servant to a Lord. As concerning Love, Faith and Hope, they are
internal Worship, not properly Adoration: Love as Love does rather import an
equality with the thing loved, and a desire of an Union, rather then a
submission. It is true, there is a perfection in that which we Love, but not
essentially to perfect the Lover, that possibly may agree to the Love between
man and man, but not to Love as Love: for the Father Loves Christ his Son, and
did delight in him from eternity, Prove. 8. 30. A superior Angel may Love an
inferior; yet the Father cannot be perfected by Loving Christ, nor a superior
Ang^l, by Loving any inferior; Faith and Hope may suppose a resting on a helper
as a helper, and so are internal Worship; if they be adoration formally may be
a Question.

It is an untruth which Raphael de la Torres, with other schoolmen Raphael. to.
^. in 22. q. 81. Art. 4. disp. vnica.
say, That with the same Religion by which we Honor holy men, we Honor God;
upon this reason, because holiness in them is a participation of the Divine
Nature, therefore God must be the intrinsecall end, and formal reason, for
which we Honor the Saints. For Holiness Honoring of Holy men is not worship.
in Saints, is a participation of the Divine nature; but it is a Temporary and
a created participation, it is not the same very holiness that is in God; but
the created effect thereof: and so the Love I bear to any Creature, because
there is somewhat of God in every Creature; And the Love to our Neighbor,
Commanded in the second Table of the Law, should be the Love of God, Commanded
in the first Table of the Law. 2. When I bow to the grayhaired, and to the
King; I then do an act of obedience to the fifth Commandment: No man can say,
that when I bow to the King, or to an holy man, that I am then bowing to the
God of heaven, and Worshipping God: No acts terminated upon Saints living or
dead, are acts of Worshipping God; yea, reverencing of the Ordinances of God,
as the delighting in, or trembling at the Word, are not properly acts of
adoring God.

Obedience is founded, not formally upon Gods excellency, properly Obedience.
so called; but upon his jurisdiction and Authority to Command.

Adoration is the subjection or prostration of soul or body to God Adoration.
in the due recognition and acknowledgement of his absolute supremacy. There is
no need, that Vasquez should deny, that there is any internal Adoration, for
that Adoration is only an external and bodily Worship of God, can hardly be
defended; for there may be, and is Adoration in the blessed Angels, as may be
gathered from Isa. 6. 1, 2, 3. H^b. 1. 6. And it is hard to say, that the
glorified spirits loosed out of the body, and received by Christ, Act. 7. 59.
Psalm. 73. 27. Into Paradise, Luke 23. 43. And so with him, Philip. 1. 23. And
Praying under the Altar, Rev. 6. 9, 10. And falling down before the Lamb, and
acknowledging that he has Redeemed them, Rev. 5. 8, 9, 10. do not Adore God
and his Son Christ; because they have nor bodies and knees to bow to him, and
yet they Adore him, Phil. 2. 9, 10. in a way suitable to their spiritual
estate. It is an untruth that Rapha. de la Torres, in 22. q. 84. Art. 2. disp.
2. n. 1. says, That Protestants detest all external Worship now under the New
Testament, as contrary to Grace, and Adoration of God in spirit and truth. For
things subordinate are not contrary; we should deny the necessity of Baptism,
and the Lords Supper, and of vocal praying and praising under the New
Testament, which are in their externals, external worship. I grant internal
Adoration, is more hardly known: But it is enough for us to say, as external
Adoration is an act by which we offer our bodies to God, and subject the utter
man to him, in sign of service and reverence to so supreme a Lord; so there is
a heart-prostration, and inward bowing of the soul, answerable thereunto.

As the profession, whither actual or habitual, in a local and bodily
approach, or in verbal titles of Honor, in which we Honor great personages,
by bowing to them, in prostration and kneeling, is an act in its state Civil,
not Religious, we intending (I press not the necessity of a ^ormall or actual
intention) only to conciliate Honor to them, suitable to their place and
dignity: so a profession, whither actual or habitual, in a Religious bodily
approach to God, either by prayer or prostration, or in^lination of the body
tending to the Honor of God is a Religious act. Now bodily prostration of it
self, is a thing in its nature indifferent, and according as is the object, so
is it either Artificial: as if one should stoop down to drive a wedge in an
image; or civil, if one bow to Honor the King; or Religious, when God and
Divine things are the object thereof: But with this difference, the intention
of the mind, added to external prostration to a creature reasonable, may make
that prostration idolatrous, and more then civil honor. Thus bowing to Haman,
The Religious object, with the act of reverencing, makes adoration to be
Religious; but a civil object, except the intention concur makes not
Religious adoration of a civil object.
Honored by Ahasuerus, who has power to confer honors, if people bow to him
as to God, is more then civil honor: And Cornelius his bowing to Peter, Act.
10. as to more then a man, is Idolatrous, and not civil honor; and the
Carpenters bowing to an Image, as to a piece of Timber formed by Art, is only
Artificial bowing; and if any stumble at a stone before an Image, and so fall
before it, it is a casual and natural fall; whereas a falling down with
intention to Adore, had been Religious Adoring: But when the object of bodily
prostration or kneeling, is God, or any Religious representation of God,
whither it be the elements of bread and wine, which are Lawful Images of
Christ, or devised pictures or portraicts of God or Christ; because these
objects are not capable of artificial, natural, or civil prostration, if
therefore they be terminating objects of bodily kneeling or prostration; these
Religious objects, to wit, God, and Religious things, must so specify these
bodily acts, as that they must make them Religious, not civil acts, though
there be no intention to bow to God; for bowing to God has from the object,
that it is a Religious bowing, though you intend not to direct that bowing to
God, as bowing to Jupiters Portraict, is a Religious Worshipping of that
Portraict, though you intend not to worship the Portraict: for the act and
Religious object together, makes the act of prostration or kneeling, to be
essentially Religious, though there be no intention to bow to these; indeed the
intention to bow to God, makes kneeling to God to be more Morally good,
laudable and acceptable before God, then if therewere no such intention, but
the want of the intention, makes it not to be no Religious worship, nor can it
make it to be civil worship. Hence let this be observed, that intention of
bowing can, or may change that bowing which otherwise were but civil (if
there were no such intention of over-esteeming the creature) into a Religious
bowing, but neither our over or under-intention can change a Religious kneeling
to God, or to an Image into a civil kneeling, because civil or natural
bowing to creatures, is more under the power of an humane and voluntary
institution of men, then Religious bowing, which has from God without any act
of man's free will, its complete nature. When we kneel to Kings, we signify by
that gesture, that we submit our selves to higher powers, not simply (says P.
Martyr.) but in so far as they Command not things Martyr, comment. in 1 King.
c. 1. v. 16.
against the Word of the Lord. When we Adore God, we Adore him as the Supreme
Majesty, being ready to obey him in what he shall Command, without any
exception; the Adoration of men, signifies a submission limited, if it go
above bounds, it is the sinful intention of the Adorer, who may change the
civil Adoration into Religious, and may ascend: But the Aderation of God cannot
so descend, as it can turn into Civil Adoration, only keeping the same object
it had before.

Worship is an action, or performance, or thing, by which we tender What
worship is?
our immediate honor to God, from the nature of the thing it self: 1. I call
it an action, because the passion of dying or suffering, is not formally
worship; but only dying comparatively, rather then denying of Christ, or dying
so, and so qualified, dying with Patience and Faith, may be called a worship.
2. I call it not an action only, but a performance or thing; because an office,
as the Priesthood, the Ministry is a worship, and yet not an action; Sometime,
Time it self, as the Sabbath Day is a Worship; yet it is not an action: So the
Lord calls it His Holy Day: and undenyably the lewish days, the High Priests
garment, and many things of that kind, were Divine or Religious performances,
things, or adjuncts of Divine Worship, but so, as they are not merely adjuncts
of Worship, but also worship; for the High Priests Ephod was not only a civil
ornament, nor was it a mere Physical or natural means to ^ence off the
injuries of sun, and Heaven, we do not think that the Lord in all, or any place
of the Old or New Testament sets down any Laws concerning garments simply,
as they do fence off cold or heat, that belongs to Art, only he speaks of
garments as contrary to gravity, as signs of vanity and lightness, Isa. 3.
16, etc. Zepha. 1. 8. 1 Pet. 3. 3, 4. And of garments as Religious observances,
of which sort was the attire and garments of the Priests and Highpriests in
their service, in which consideration the Religious times, holy places, and
Mosaicall garments were Divine Worship, by which God was immediately honored,
but not adjuncts only, or actions; but Religious things or performances. 3. It
is such a performance, as from thence honor does immediately redound to God,
but that this may be the clearer; I conceive Worship is an immediate honoring
of God, but some worship hon^reth him more immediately, some less.
that there is a twofold immediate honoring of God, in the worship of God: 1.
An honoring of God less immediate, as hearing of the word, is an immediate
honoring of God, because honor flows immediately from God, both Ex
condition operis, and Ex condition operantis; from the nature of the work,
and intention of the worker: yet it is a less immediate honoring of God, in
regard, that I may also hear the word even from the condition of the work, and
so from the intrinsecall end of the worker, that I may learn to know God, and
believe, for thus far I am led to honor God immediately in hearing the word;
that action of its own nature conveying honor to God; there interveeneth also
a medium amidst between me and honoring of God, to wit, the Preacher, or the
Bible; to which no external adoration is due: There is another more immediate
worship, to wit, praising of God, from which by an immediate result, God is
honored, and in worship especially strictly immediate, God is immediately
honored both in the intention of the work, and the intrinsecall end of it, and
the intention of the worker; though no other thing be done, and others be not
edified either in knowledge, increase of Faith, or any other ways: And in
this, duties of the second Table, of mercy and justice, differ from worship, in
that such acts of love and mercy, as to give alms to save the life of my
brother, or of his beast, are not acts of worshipping God; their intrinsecall
end, and the nature of the work being to do good to the creature, principally,
Ex natura, and condition operis, though God also thereby be honored; yet in a
more secundary consideration: For I praying to God, do immediately from the
nature of the action honor God, though no good should either redound to my
self, or to the creature; thereby, it is true, God, by acts of love and mercy
to our neighbor, is honored two ways: 1. In that men seeing our good works
do thence take occasion to glorify our Heavenly ^ather, whose truth teaches
us by the grace of God to do these works, but the intrinsecall and proper use
of these, is to do good to our selves as in works of sobriety, and to our
neighbor, as in works of righteous dealing, but not immediately, and i^ the
first and primary consideration to honor God, as in works of Piety, holiness
and worship, the honoring of God by secondary resultance, does issue also from
these duties of righteousness, but not as from the acts of praying, praising,
Sacramental eating, drinking. 2. The doer of these acts of mercy, may, and is
to intend the honoring of God.

There is a twofold intention in worship, one formal and properly A twofold
intention in worship.
Religious, and is expounded Moral, Ex natura rei, to be Religious, it being
such an intention, as can have no other state in worship, but a Religious
State, as if the three Children should bow at the Commmandment of the King of
Babylon, though intending to worship the true God. Here should be an
intrinsecall intention, Ex natura and condition operis, to worship, and that
from two grounds conjoined together: 1. Here is bowing down: 2. Bowing down to
a Religious Object, commanded by a Prince, and so comes under the Moral
notion of the command of a Judge. When the object of bowing down is Religious,
the signication that we give divine honor to God by kneeling is as inseparable
(says Raphael de la Torres) from kneeling or bowing down, as a bearing
testimony by word, that God is true, and knows all secrets, and will be
avenged on perjury, is inseparable from vocal swearing by the name of God, or
as any man should be an Idolater, who in express words should say to an Idol,
O my God Jupiter help De la Tor. tom. 2. in 22. q. 94. Art. 2. Si quis
inter^ellarit idolum dicens expressis verbis, Jupiter, deus meus adjuva me,
quamvis conarctur fingere istam invocationem, de^estans interius Jovem, et
omnes falsos d^os, vere idolatra esset, quia ab illis verbis in separabilis est
significatio ex hibendi cultum Divinum idolo.
me, though that Adoration were fained, and he who so prays, should in his
heart abhor and detest Jupiter and all false Gods: But there is another
intention not Religious; if a Child read a Chapter of the Bible, that he may
learn to read and spell, that is an action of Art, not of Worship; because the
object of the Childs reading, is not Scripture as Scripture, but only the
Printed Characters as they are, Signa rerum ut rerum, non ut rerum sacrarum,
signs of things, not of holy things, and here the object not being Religious,
the intrinsecall operation cannot raise up any Religious intention of the
Child. Upon this ground, it is easy to determine whether or no an intention
of Worship be essential to Worship or not, the former intention which is
intrinsecall, and Intentio operis, may be essential, it resulting from the
object; but the latter intention of the worker, is so far extraneous to
Worship, as whether it be, or be not, the nature of Worship is not impaired nor
violated.

Hence, Adoration is worship; But every worship is not Adoration. Uncovering
the head, seems to be little older then Paul's Epistles to the Corinthians.
The Learned Salmasius, thinks it but a National sign of honor, no ways
universally received: But certainly it is not Adoration: Though therefore we
receive the Supper of the Lord uncovered, no man can conclude from thence
Adoration of the Elements, as we do from kneeling conclude the same, as we
shall here for all bodily worship or expression of our affection to the means
of graces (though these means be but creatures) is not Adoration properly
either of God, or of these means, it is Lawful to tremble at the word, and for
Josiah to weep before the Book of the Law read, and for the Martyrs to kiss
the Stake, Uncovering of the head, is Veneration, not Adoration.
as the Instrument by which they glorified God, in dying for the truth; all
these being Objectam quo, and means by the which they conveyed their worship to
the true God, and natural and Lawful expressions of their affection to God:
For uncovering the head, it is a sort of Veneration or Reverence, not
Adoration; and Paul insinuates so much when he says, 1 Cor. 11. 4. Every man
praying and prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head: But it
is not his meaning, that he dishonoreth God. 2. The Jews to this day, as of
old, used not uncovering the head as a sign of honor: But by the contrary,
covering was a sign of honor: If therefore the Jews, being made a visible
Church, shall receive the Lords Supper, and Pray and Prophecy with covered
heads, men would judge it no dishonouring of their head, or not of dis-respect
of the Ordinances of God: Though Paul having regard to a National Custom in
Corinth, did so esteem of it.

Antonius Corduba a Franciscan, enumerateth nine external acts Corduba, l. 1.
q. 5. dub. 6.
of Adoration, but speaks nothing of uncovering the head; as 1. Sacrificing.
2. Martyrdom. 3. Giving and Receiving the Sacraments. 4. Suiting of Pardon. 5.
Suiting of Grace. 6. Smiting the breast. 7. Building of Churches. 8.
Institution of Feasts. 9. Vows and Oaths. Prelaticall Formalists side with
them, in Building and Consecrating of Churches, and Holy Days, which are but
will*worship, as used by them: And for Martyrdom, it is formally an act of
Christian fortitude, not worship, the confession of Gods truth a Conc^mitant of
Martyrdom, is indeed worship. How suiting of Pardon, and suiting of Grace are
two external acts of Adoration, I see not: for by this way, if we regard the
multitude of things that we suit, Consecration of Churches taken two ways.
there should be more then two: Consecrating of Churches is taken two ways: 1.
For a mere dedication or Civil destination of any thing to its end and use: As
when a house is builded, a garment is first put on, when we refresh our selves
with a draught of water, we may pray for a blessing on these, and on all the
Creatures for our use, and the very habitual intention of the builder of an
house to dwell in, is a Civil dedication of it to that use for which it is
Ordained. Prayer added to it for a blessing of it in the use, makes not a
Consecrated thing; for then my clothes every day put on, my sleep, my daily
walking in and out, my Physic, my meals, my horse, my ship I sail in, should
all be Holy, Consecrated, and Religious things, which I were to Reverence as
Religious things; for all these may be blessed in their use: But here is that
we condemn Consecration of Churches condemned
in Religious dedication of Churches: 1. That the end being sacred, to wit, the
habitual worshipping of God in that place. 2. The praying for the Church or
house of worship, to say nothing of the vain Ceremonies used in the dedication
of Churches: These two are applied to make the Church holy, and to denominate
it the house of God, and capable of Religious veneration, and salutation: Then
certainly, all the Synagogues of Judea, should be Religiously holy, as was the
Temple. 2. And Prayers should be more acceptable to God in the Synagogue for
the houses sake, then prayers in any other place. 3. God shall bind himself by
promise to hear prayers in the Synagogue, or made with the face toward the
Synagogue, as he did toward the Temple: we were obliged in the New Testament to
pray with our faces toward the Churches or meeting places in the New Testament,
and we should have one famous and celebrious Church for all Jews and Gentiles,
more holy then all the little holy Temples now consecrated as holy places, and
where shall this be? And what typical signification shall it have? It must
signify Christ to come, or already come, both is unlawful.

2. Again, if habitual Dedication by virtue of Prayer make a place holy, by
the same reason actual Dedication should make a place holy; and the belly of
the Whale should have been holy because there Jonah prayed, and every place a
believer prays shall be holy, his closet, a private corner of his Orchard or
Garden where he prays shall be holy, for these may be habitually destined and
appointed (if you call this Dedication) for prayer only, and it shall be
unlawful to do any civil business there, more then it is unlawful (as
Formalists teach) to do any other civil business in the Churches, or places of
meeting in the New Testament: 3. God himself appointed the place, the Time when
it should be built, the person, by whom, by Solomon, not David; the length, the
breadth, the Chambers, Porches, Ornaments of the only holy place at Jerusalem;
he has no where appointed and prescribed these for the meeting places of the
New Testament, but has said that all places are alike, as touching any
Religious holiness, Ioh. 4. 23. 1 Timothy 2. 8. 4. Shall we think God is not
acceptably served, and that the Synagogues of the Jews, of which we read not
any pattern or rule for Dedication, are Profane, because they are not Dedicated
by the Durand* Rati. l. 1. c. 6. Eusebius, l. 8. c. 8. 9, l. 10. c. 2, 3.
Bishops laying the first foundation stone of the house? Or because they want
the ornaments of whorish Ceremonies, that Durandus enumerateth? or because they
have not the surpassing beauty of admirable Temples, that Christians now a
little overswelling with the zeal of prosperity builded for the worship of God,
out of superlative detestation of Dioclesian, and Maximinus, who had demolished
all the Churches which Christians had leave to build under tolerable Emperors,
such as Severus, Gordianus, Philip, and Galienus, as Eusebius teaches? Or that
we are to give a Testimony of as cheerful affection for the beautifying of
Temples, void of all typical relation to the glory of Jesus Christ, as David
did show, 1 Chronicles. 28 14. 2 Chronicles. 2. 5. And that it is Moral and perpetually
obligatory under the New Testament; that we bestow charges upon sumptuous
Temples, upon these fancied grounds of Master Hooker? For his first Moral
ground is, Nothing is too dear to be bestowed about the furniture of Gods
service: 2. Because sumptuous Temples serve to the world for a witness of his
almightinesse, whom we outwardly serve, and honor with the chiefest of outward
things, as being of all things himself incomparably the greatest: 3. It were
Hooker. ecl. pol. 5. book p, 208. Mr. Hookers fancied Moral grounds of the
holiness of Churches under the New Testament answered.
strange, that God should have made such store of glorious creatures on earth,
and leave them all to be consumed on secular vanity, allowing none but the
baser sort to be employed in his own service: 4. Rarest and most gorgeous
treasures are too little for earthly Kings. 5. If the corruptible Temples of
the holy spirit are to be served with rich alms, what should be done for
houses to edify the living Temples redeemed by Jesus Christ: To all which I
say: 1. The Temple of Jerusalem in its glory, proportion and beauty, was a
Positive worship, and so must be warranted by the positive Warrant of the Word,
and the like Warrant must all our Churches in the New Testament have: 2. If we
must extend our liberality and bounty toward God to the highest, and to
testify the greatness and Almightinesse of him whom we serve: then did David
and Solomon in both fail, there were more glorious and rich houses on earth,
and diverse times have been builded to the honor of false gods, and to declare
the Royal magnificence of mortal Kings: God never for his own honor
appointed such a banquet as Ahasureosh did, to continue for an hundred and
fourscore days, Esther 1. 4. More might, and ought to have been done by David
and Solomon, if it had been a moral ground to build a house, to be a witness
of Almightinesse: 3. And God appointed sacrifices, and Sacraments in both
Testaments, as Testimonies of the great Lord Jesus; yet in base and obvious
creatures; we may not devise Symbols or witnessing Images of the Almightinesse
of that God whom we serve, at our pleasure: 4. If our Lord love mercy better
then Sacrifice, especially under the New Testament, when his worship must be
more spiritual: Then the Argument may be strongly retorted, we are to bestow
more on feeding the living Members of Christ's body (which yet is not secular
vanity) then on dead stones; except Master Hooker can warrant us to serve God
under the New Testament in precious stones and gold, for which we can see no
Warrant: 5. All these Arguments are broadly used by Papists, for Images and
rich Churches: Nor does Hooker give us any Argument for this, but what Papists
gave before The place 1 Cor 11. Have ye not houses, etc. Makethnothing for
hallowing of Churches.
him: Have ye not houses (says he) to eat and drink in; Ergo, He teaches a
difference between house and house, and what is fit for the dwelling place of
God, and what for man's habitation, the one for common food, the other for none
but for heavenly food.

Ans. That there was public meeting places and Churches in Corinth, now under
Heathen Rulers, 1 Cor. 6. is denied, by all both Protestant and Popish writers,
far less had they then any consecrated Churches, and from the inconveniency of
taking their Supper while some were full and drunk in the place where the Lords
Supper was Celebrated, whereas they ought to have Supped in their own houses:
to infer that the Church is a holier place, then their own house, I profess is
Logic, I do not understand, it only concludes these two sort of houses are
destinated from two sort of different uses, sacred and profane and no more.

Neither am I much moved at that, Psalm. 74. which is said, ver. 8. (...) Nor
the place, Psalm. 74. 8.
They have burnt all the convening places, or all the Congregations of God in
the land: Vatablus, expounds it of the Temple: Exusserunt totum Templum Dei
terrenum: Or all the question will be, why the Synagogues are called Gods
Synagogues, as they called the Temple, Ier. 7. 4. (...) The Temple of the Lord,
and (...), The house of the Lord: Whither because every Synagogue was no less
in its own kind a house holy to the Lord then the Temple: Certainly there is
no rational ground to say, that Synagogues were Typical, that the people were
to pray with their faces toward the Synagogue, and to offer Sacrifices in the
Synagogue: But that a Synagogue is called the house of God, from the use and
end, because it was ordained for the worship of God, as that which God has
appointed for a special end and work, in that the Lord assumeth the propriety
thereof to himself, so says the Lord of Cyrus, Isa. 45. 1. Thus says the Lord
to his Anointed, to Cyrus whose right hand I have holden; yet was not Cyrus
Typically, or Religiously holy, as the Temple of Jerusalem, and c. 44. v. 28.
He says of Cyrus, He is my shepherd: and why? He shall perform all The Synague
not Gods house as the Temple was.
my pleasure, so Hos. 2. 9. Therefore will I return (says God) and take away
my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will
recover my wool and my flax (given) to cover her nakedness, To say nothing
that all the holy land was Gods land, Hos. 9. 3. They shall not dwell in the
Lords land; and consequently all the Synagogues were Gods houses; and the enemy
of whom the Church complains to God in that Psalm, was thus bold, as
notwithstanding Canaan was Gods Heritage and proper Land in a special manner,
yet it was destroyed and burnt by the enemies, even these houses that God was
worshipped in, not being spared; But how God was so present in every Synagogue,
and that even when there were no actual worship of God in it, as he was in the
Temple, and that it was so holy a place, as they were to put off there shoes
who came into the Synagogue, God showing his own immediate presence in every
synagogue, as he did, Exodus 3. 5. To Moses in the burning bush, Exodus 5. 1. v.
12. Is a thing that has no warrant in the word of God; for if every synagogue
had been thus holy: 1. It should have been a house dedicated to God in a
Religious way, as was the Temple: 2. God should dwell in every Synagogue then,
and in every Church under the New Testament now, as he said he would dwell in
the Temple. 3. Then must Heathens and the uncircumcised be forbidden to come
into any Synagogue, or any Church under the New Testament, the contrary whereof
was evident in scripture; none were forbidden to enter in the Synagogues, Paul,
1 Cor. 14. 23, 24. allows that Heathens come into the Churches or meetings
where Christians are worshipping God. 4. If either the Temple of Ierusulem was
holy for the worship in it, or for that it was a Type of our Material Temples
under the New Testament, then our Churches under the New Testament shall be
more holy, yea, our private houses in which we may worship God shall be more
holy, as our worship is more spiritual then carnal Commandments of the
Leviticall Law were, and the body must be more holy then the shadow; yea, all
the earth now from the rising of the sun, to the going down of the same, in
regard of more spiritual worship, even the Stables and Alehouses, where we may
offer the Incense of Prayer to God, and offer the sacrifices of praises, Mal.
1. 11. shall be alike holy, as either our Churches or the Temple was of old.

CAP. I.
Q. 1. Whether or not Humane Ceremonies in Gods Worship, can consist with the
perfection of Gods Word?

THese humane Ceremonies we cannot but reject upon these grounds;

Our first Argument is: Every positive and Religious observance, and Rite in
Gods worship, not Arg. 1.
warranted by Gods Word, is unlawful: But humane Ceremonies are such: Ergo,

The Proposition is sure, the holy Spirit uses a Negative Argument, The
negative Argument from Scripture valid.
Act. 15. 24. We gave no such Commandment, Levit. 10. 1. Jer. 7. 30. and 19. 5,
6. and 32. 35. 2 Samuel 7. 7. 1 Chronicles. 15. 13. The Lord Commanded not this, Ergo,
It is not Lawful.

Formalists, Answer: Every worship holden to be of Divine necessity and yet not
Commanded by God, is unlawful; but not every worship holden as free, and not
binding the Conscience, requires that God Command it.

Ans. 1. Gods Consequence is from the want of a Lawful efficient and Author;
you make him to reason from an Adjunct of the worship: But all worship has
necessity, and Divinity, and a binding power only from the Author God. For why
is it Lawful to Abraham to kill or intend to kill his Son? Why is not eating
the forbidden fruit Lawful? Only because God Commands; and if God forbid
Abraham to kill his Son, and Command Adam to eat, it is Lawful. 2. If this be
good, observe all the Ceremonial Law, so you lay not Divine necessity upon the
observance thereof; offer Sacrifices to God under the New Testament, and you
cannot fail in the worship against the Institutor* So slaying of the Children
to Molech, so you count it free and changeable, shall not fail against Gods
Commandments of the first Table ( I Command it not.) They Answer, To kill
Children, is Man slaughter; but I Reply: God does no^, Ier. 7. Reason against
Offering the seed to Molech, as it was murder and forbidden in the sixth
Commandment: but as false worship, and forbidden in the second Commandment:
Else he proves not, that it was unlawful worship against piety, but that it
was an act of cruelty: Yea, so it be thought free and bind not the Conscience,
it may be Lawful worship, and is not condemned by this ( God Commanded it not)
Ergo, It is not Lawful.

I Commanded not, (says Morton defense of Cere. gener. q* 1. Sect. 12.
Morton, and Burges, rejoinder, p. 41.
D. Burges.) that is, I discommanded, or forbade. Ans. So Gregor. de Valent.
to. 3 dis 6. q. 2. re^. ad. 2. obj. Constat quandoquo dici non preceptum id
quod adeo non est preceptum, ut sit etiam contra preceptum.
says the Jesuit Valentia; but so, Circumcising of women, boiling of the
Paschall Lamb, another Ark then Moses made, should not be unlawful, for these
are not expressly discommanded. But Gods Commanding to Circumcise the
Male-childe, to Roast the Paschall Lamb, to make this Ark: and his silence of
Circumcision of women, and boiling the Passover, and silence of another Ark,
is a Command. 2. The Text, Jer. 7. Is wronged, I Commanded not, neither came it
in my heart to Command this Abomination: That is, I never purposed it as
worship: else they knew, to kill their Children, except to God, as Abraham was
Commanded, was unlawful, as Isa. 63. 4. The Not to command, is to forbid
day of Vengeance is in mine heart, 2 King. 10. 30. 1 King. 8. 18. Gen* 27. 41.
To be in ones heart, is to purpose a thing. 3. Valentia says, Exodus 18. 20. I
Commanded not the false Prophet to speak; But how? By not sending or calling
him: Else God did not say by a Positive Commandment to every false Prophet,
Prophecy not; but because God b^de him not Prophecy, he was to know God forbade
him: Else to speak Arbitrary Doctrines and Prophesies, not tying the
Conscience, were no false Prophesying.

They Object, 1 King. 8. 17. It was well that it was in David's heart to build a
house to God, and yet David had no warrant in Gods Word, for to build an house
to God. So Morton Morton gener. defe, c. 1. Sect. 6, 7.
Burges Burges, rejoinder, c. 1. Sect. 7. p. 34. Of David's purpose to build the
Temple, how far it was lawful.
Ans. David had a twofold will and purpose to build Gods house: 1.
Conditional: It was revealed to David, that God would have an house built,
therefore David might conditionally purpose to build it; so it was Gods will he
should be the man. This wants not Gods word: We may desire what ever may
promove Gods glory conditionally. As that Petition teaches ( Thy Kingdom
come.) This was recommended of God and approved* 2 Kin. 8. 17. 2. A resolute
will upon Nathans mistake, the blind leading the blind, this was not
Commanded, though the desire of the end was good, that is, that a house should
be built.

Morton, 16. It was Lawful upon common equity, considering Gods mercy to him,
in subduing his enemies, and that he dwelt in Cedars, whereas God wanted an
house, but he could not actually perform it, without Gods word: So Burges.

Ans. 1. The consequence without Gods word, is as good to conclude, that David
might actually build Gods house, as to will and purpose to build it: Because
the word is a perfect rule to our thoughts and purposes, no less then to our
actions; if to build without Gods Word was unlawful: Ergo, to purpose this
without Gods Word was unlawful. A purpose of sin, as of Adultery, is sin, a
purpose of will worship, is will worship and sin. 2. A man of blood is as unfit
to purpose to be a type of a peaceable Savior, as to be a type of a Savior,
3. If God reprove Samuels light for judging according to the eye, 1 Samuel 16. 7.
Far more he rebukes his purpose to Anoint a man without his word, Who gives
Kingdoms to whom he pleases: Yet Samuel had a good intention, and Gods word in
general, that one of Iesse's Sons should be King. 4. I^ that good purpose had
remained with David deliberately to build the Lords house, after the Lord had
said, Solomon, not David, must build the house, it would have been sinful; yet
the reasons upon common equity, and a general warrant that God would have an
house, had been as good as before: if Mortons consequence be once good, its
ever good. 5. By this, without the warrant of the Word, we may purpose to
glorify God: The Baptist without Gods warrant, may purpose a New Sacrament,
Cajaphas may purpose that he shall be the man who shall dye for the people: I
may purpose to glorify God, by a thousand new means of worshipping: Papists
have good intentions in all they do. 6. A purpose of heart is an inward
substantial worship warranted by Gods Word, Psalm. 19. 14. Psalm. 50. 21. Psalm.
74. 11. Ier. 4. 14. Genesis 8. 2. Eccles. 2, 3. Isa. 55. 7. Ergo, The word is not
a rule in substantial and Moral Duties; heart-purposes cannot be indifferent
heart-ceremonies. 7. David needed not ask counsel at Gods mouth and word, for
an indifferent heart-purpose, grounded upon sufficient warrant of common
equity, whether he should act it or no^; that which warranteth the good
purpose, warranteth the enacting of the good purpose. 8. Who knows if God
rewards additions to the word, with a sure house, and all indifferent
Ceremonies?

All additions to Gods Word are unlawful* Deuteronomy. 4* ^. Deuteronomy. 12. Arg. 2. Of

are from Gods Spirit: But has Gods Spirit lost all Majesty, Divinity and
power in speaking? If the Popes Decretals, the Councels, the dirty Traditions,
wanting life, Language, and power, be from Gods Spirit: Formalists admit
Traditions from an humane spirit, and in this are shamed even by Papists, who
say, God only ^an add to his own Word, whereas they say, men, and the worst of
men, Prelates may add to Gods word: 4. But that additions perfecting are
forbidden is clear: 1. Additions perfecting, as Didoclavius Didocl. in alt.
Damasc. p. 504, 505.
says, argues the word of imperfection, and that Baptism is not perfect
without Crossing. 2. It is Gods Prerogative to add Canonick Scripture to the
five books of Moses, and the Nevv-Testament, and the doctrine of the Sacraments
which cannot be Syllogistically deduced out of the Old Testament, Matthew. 28.
19, 20. Ioh. 21. 31. Heb. 3. 2. Rev. 1. 19. and these are perfecting and
explaining additions, therefore men may by as good reason add Canonick
Scripture to the Revelation, as add new Positive Doctrines like this ( The
holy Surplice is a sacred sign of Pastoral Holiness) (Crossing is a sign of
dedicating the child to Christ's service) for Papists ^ay, even Vasquez Vasqu.
to. 2. in 12. disp. 154. cap. 3. Respondetu^ pontificem quidem nec extra
generale concilium nec inill^ posse Statuere aliquid de fide quod non
contineatur in principiis and articulis revelatis aut certissime ex iis
colligatur.
That the Pope neither in a general Council, nor out of it, can ordain any
new points of Faith, which are not contained in the principles or Articles
revealed, and may not be evidently concluded out of them.

Formalists answer, It is not lavvfull to add any thing as a part of divine
worship, but it is Lawful to add^ something as an indifferent Rite, coming
from Authority grounded upon common equity* And this is the answer of the
Jesuit Vasquez Vasq. ib.
The Pope and Church cannot make an Article of Faith, for that is believed by
divine Faith, to come from God only, but as Lawgivers they may give Laws that
binds the conscience, and yet are not altogether essential in worship. If
additions, as divine parts of Gods worship (say we) be forbidden; God then
forbidding to add such Traditions, forbids his own spirit to add to Gods
word, for no man but God can add additions Divine, that is, coming from God,
but God himself, and by good consequence the forbidding men to add additions,
as really coming from God, should forbid men to be Gods, for divine additions
are essentially additions coming from God; but if he forbid additions only of
men's divising, but obtruded to have the like efficacy and power over the
conscience, that Canonick Scripture has, then were it lawful to add killing
of our children to Molech, so it were counted not really to come from God, with
opinion of divine necessity; and by this, God should not forbid things to be
added to his Word, by either private or public men, but only he should forbid
things to be added with such a quality, as that they should by Divine Faith be
received as coming from God, and having the heavenly stamp of Canonick
Scripture, when as they are come only from the Pope and his bastard Bishops; so
all the fables of the Evangell of Nicodemus; The materials of the Jewish and
Turkish Religion might be received as lawful additions, so they do not
contradict the Scripture, as contrary to what is written, but only beside what
is written, and with all, so they be received as from the Church: Also 3.
Additions contrary to the word, are diminutions; to add to the eight Command
this addition (The Church says it is lawful to steal) were no addition to the
ten Commandments, but should destroy the eight Commandment, and make nine
Commandments only, and the meaning of Gods precept, Deuteronomy. 12. Thou shall
neither add, nor diminish; should be, Thou shall neither diminish, neither
shall thou diminish: And so our Masters make Moses to forbid no additions at
all: 6. Commentaries and Expositions of the Word, if sound, shall be the word
of God it self; the true sense of a speech, is the form and essence of a
speech, and so no additions thereunto but explanations, except you make all
sound Sermons, Arbitrary Ceremonies and Traditions, whereas Articles of Faith
expounded are Sermons, and so the Scripture it self materially taken, is but a
Tradition.

QUEST. II.
Whether Scripture be such a perfect rule of all our Moral Actions; a^ that
the distinction of essential and necessary, and of accidental and Arbitrary
worship cannot stand? And if it forbid all worship not only contrary, but also
beside the word of God as false, though it be not reputed as divine and
necessary.

FOrmalists do acknowledge, as Morton, Burges, Hooker, and others teach us,
that Ceremonies which are mere Ceremonies, indifferent in nature and opinion,
are not forbidden: yea, that in the general they are commanded upon common
equity, and in particular according to their specification, Surplice, Crossing,
Kn^eling before consecrated Images, and representations of Christ are not
forbidden, and negatively Lawful, having Gods allowing if not his commanding
will; but only God forbids such Ceremonies, wherein men place opinion of
divine necessity, holiness and efficacy, in which case they become Doctrinall,
and essential, and so men's inventions are not Arbitrary and accidental
worship: But let these considerations be weighed.

1. Distinct. The Word of Go* being given to man, as a Moral Agent, is a rule
of all his Moral Actions, but not of actions of Art, Sciences, Disciplines;
yea, on of mere nature.

2. Distinct. (Beside the Word) in actions Moral, and in Gods worship, is all
one with that (which is contrary to the Word) and what is not commanded is
forbidden, as not seeing in a creature capable of all the five senses is down
right blindness.

3. Lawfulness is essential to worship instituted of God, but it is not
essential to worship i^ general: neither is opinion of sanctity, efficacy, or
Divine necessity essential to worship, but only to Divine worship, and its
opinion not actual nor formal, but fundamental and material.

4. Seeing the Apostles were no less immediately inspired of God, then the
Prophets, it is a vain thing to seek a knot in a rush, and put a difference
betwixt Apostolic Commandments or Traditions and divine Commandments, as it is
a vain and Scripturelesse curiosity to difference betwixt the Prophetical
truths of Moses, Samuel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, etc. And Divine Prophecies,
which is, as if you would difference betwixt the fair writing of Titus the
writer, and the writing made by the pen of Titus, or betwixt Peter's words, and
the words spoken by Pete^^ tongue, mouth and lips, for Prophets and Apostles
were both Gods mouth.

5. Worship essential, and Worship Arbitrary, which Formalists inculcate; or
worship positively lavvfull, or negatively lavvfull, are to be acknowledged as
worship Lawful, and Will Worship, and worship Lawful and unlawful.

6. What is warranted by natural reason, is warranted by Scripture, for the
Law of nature is but a part of Scripture.

7. Actions are either purely moral, or purely not moral, or mixed of both:
The first has vvarrant in Scripture, the second none at all, the third
requires not a vvarrant of Scripture every way concludent, but only in so far
as they be Moral.

8. Matters of mere fact, known by sense and humane testimony, are to be
considered according to their Physical existence if they be done or not done;
if Titus did such a thing or not, such are not in that notion to be proved by
Scripture: 2. They may be considered according to their essence and Moral
quality of good and lawful, ^ad or unlawful, and so they are to be warranted
by Scripture.

9. There is a general vvarrant in Scripture for Worship and moral actions,
tvvofold: either when the Major proposition is only in Scripture, and the
Assumption is the will of men, or when both the Proposition and Assumption
are warranted by Scripture: the former vvarrant I think not sufficient, and
therefore the latter is necessary to prove the thing lavvfull.

Hence our 1. conclusion. Every worship, and Positive observance of Religion,
and all Moral actions are to be made good, by (...) (according as it is
written) though their individual circumstances be not in the word.

2. The offering, for the Babe Jesus, two Turtle Doves, and ^vvo Every Moral

the children whom he spared: because these be Physical, and not Moral
circumstances, as concerning the essence of the Law of God. Hence in the
Categorie of all Lawful Worship and Moral actions: both Proposition and
Assumption is made good by this, As it is written, even to the lowest
specifice degree of morality as all these.

1. The Worship of God. 2. Sacramental worship under that. 3. Under that,
participation of the Lords Supper. 4. Under all, the most special
participation of the Lords Supper by John, Anna, in such a Congregation, such a
day; All these I say, both in Proposition and Assumption are proved by (...):
And can bid this (according as it is written) the like I may instance in all
other Worship, in all acts of Discipline, in all Moral acts of justice and
mercy, in the second Table: But come to the Prelates Calendar, They cry (Order
and decency is Commanded in Gods Worship.) And we hear Paul's cry, not theirs;
but under this is, 2. (Orderly and decent Ceremonies of humane institution;)
And here they have lost Paul's cry, and the Scriptures (as it is written) 3.

book, but no where else: So do Papists say, What ever the Church teach, that is
Divine truth. Under this comes in, invocations of Saints, Purgatory, and all
other fatherless Traditions, which though Papists should teach to be Arbitrary
and indifferent; yet would we never allow them room in Gods house, seeing they

in Gods Worship, what ever is ours, as will worship, Hence, 2. All worship and
new Positive means of worship, devised by men, are unlawful; but humane
Ceremonies, are such, Ergo,

The Proposition is proved many ways: as, 1. What is man's in Gods Worship, and
came from Lord-man, is challenged as false, vain, and unlawful, because not

Also, I prove our Conclusion. 3. thus: If the word be a rule to direct a young

actions we walk in darkness, we fall, stumble, go aside, and are taught some
good way, and instructed about the use of some holy Crossing, some Doctrine of
Purgatory, and Saint-worship, without the light of the Word: But this latter is
absurd: Ergo, So is the former.

It is poor what Rich. Hooker, discip. book 2. p. 55, 56. 58, 59. 8.
Hooker says against us: If Wisdom of Scripture teach us every good path,
Prove. 2. 9. By Sccripture only, and by no other mean, then there is no art and
trade, but Sripture should teach: But Wisdom teaches something by Scripture,
something by spiritual influence, something by Worldy experience, Thomas
believed Christ was risen by sense, because he savv him, not by Scripture, the
Jews believed by Christ's miracles.

Ans. 1. Some actions in man are merely natural, as to grow; Not all actions
in man, but Moral actions only are regulated by the word.
these are not regulated by the word. 2. Some agree to man, as he lives, as to
sleep, eat, drink, and these are considered as animal actions, Actiones
animales, and do not belong to our Question: But as they are in man, they be
two ways regulated by the word. 1. According to the substance of the act, the
Law of nature, and consequently, the word of God Commands them: If one should
kill himself through total abstinence from meat and sleep, he should sin
against the Law of nature. 2. These actions according as they are to be
moderated by reason, are to be performed soberly, and are in Gods word
Commanded. Eccles. 3, 4. 2. 4. Luke 21. 24 1 Thessalonians. 5, 6, 7.
3. Some actions agree to man, as he is an Artificial, or Scientifick agent,
as to speak right Latin, to make accurate demonstrations in Geometry, and
these are ruled by Art, man in these, as they be such, is not a Moral Agent,
but an Artificial Agent, I say as they are such, because while one speaks
Latin according to the Art of Disputer or Linacer, he should not lie, and all
morality in these actions are to be ruled by Gods word, and as actions of Art,
they are not every good path, or every good Moral way that Solomon speaks
of, Prove. 2. 9. and therefore it is a vain Argument against the perfection of
Gods word.

2. Hooker says, God teaches us something by spiritual influence Ans. If
without the word, by only influence, spiritual, as he taught the Prophets; it
was a vain instance, for influence, visions, inspirations were of old in place
of Scripture. If Ceremonies, as Crossing and Surplice come this way from God,
they be as nobly born, as the Old and New Testament: If God teach any thing now
by influence spiritual without Scripture. Hooker is an Enthusiast, and an
Anabaptist: If experience and sense teach many things now, which Scripture does
not teach, and yet is worship, or a Moral Action, we desire to know these: 3.
The instance of Thomas, learning that Christ is risen from the dead, by sense
and not by Scripture, and of the Jews believing by miracles, and not by
Scripture, might make a Jesuit blush, for Christ's Resurrection, and the
Doctrine of the Gospel confirmed by Miracles, are not Arbitrary Rites beside
Gods word, Helps of faith, and the formal object of faith are different.
but fundamentals of salvation: Hence the man will have us believe God
reveals Articles of faith to us, by other means then by his word: Thomas was
helped by his sense, and some Jews to believe Christ's Death and Resurrection by
miracles: But the formal Object of their Faith, was the Lord speaking in his
scriptures.

2. Hooker Objecteth; When many meats are set before me in the Table, all are
indifferent, none unlawful, if I must be ruled by Scripture, and eat in faith,
and not by natures light, and common discretion: I shall sin in eating one meat
before another. How many things (says Sanderson in his Sermon.
Sanderson) do Parents and Masters command their servants and sons? Shall they
disobey, while they find a warrant from Scripture?

Ans. For eating in measure, the Scripture does regulate us, for eating for
Gods glory, the scripture also does regulate us, and the action of eating
according to the substance of the action, is warranted by the Law of nature,
which is a part of the word; the mere order in eating is not a Moral action,
and so without the lists of the question. If the question be of the order of
eating, I think not that a Moral action: 2. Eating of diverse meats is a mixed
action, and so requires not a warrant in the Morality every way; if you eat
such meats (where there be variety to choose) as you know does engender a
Stone, or a Cholick, you sin against the sixth Commandment: 3. Masters,
Parents, Commanders of Armies may command Apprentices, servants, sons,
soldiers, many Artificial actions, in Trades, in War, where both Commanders
and obeyers are artificial, not moral Agents, and so they touch not the
question, but what is moral in all actions of Art, Economy, Sciences, is
ruled by the word, except our Masters offend that Paul said, Children should
obey their Parents in the Lord: That men are not both in commanding inferiors,
and obeying Superiors vexed with scruples, comes not from the insufficiency
of Gods word, but from this, that men's consciences are all made of stoutnesse.
But if this be true, Seth, Enoch, Noah, Shem, could not eat nor sleep (says
Hooker 2 book, Eccles. Pol. p. 60, 61.
Hooker) but by revelation which was Scripture to them.

Answer, Supernatural Revelation was to these Fathers the rule of Gods
worship, and all their actions supernatural, and of all their actions moral,
in relation to the last end; but for eating and drinking, they being actions
natural, they were to be regulated in these; by natural reason, and the Law
of nature, which was apart then of the Divine Tradition that then ruled the
Church, while as yet the word was not written. Hooker urges thus; It will
follow that Moses, Natural reason is a part of Scripture.
the Prophets and Apostles should not have used natural Arguments, to move
people to do their duty; they should only have used this Argument (As it is
written) else they taught them other grounds and warrants for their actions
then Scripture. Ans. None can deny natural Arguments to be a part of the word
of God, as is clear, Romans 1. 19. 1 Cor. 15. 36, 37. 1 Cor. 11. 14. Yea, Christ,
Mat. 7. 12. teaches, that this principle of nature (whatsoever ye would men
should do to you, do ye so to them) is the Law and the Prophets, because it is
a great part of the Law and the Prophets, and therefore they say in effect ( As
it written in the Scripture) when they say ( as it is written in man's heart by
nature.) 2. Principles* of nature, are made scripture by the Penmen of the
holy Ghost, and do bind as the Scripture. 3. It will be long ere the Law of
nature teach Crossing, and kneeling to bread, to be good Ceremony.

my friends, except I had warrant from Scripture, and seeing the Scripture is
as perfect in acts of the second Table, as in acts of the first; I must have a
reason of all the business betwixt man and man, of all humane and municipall
Laws, but it is certain (says Sanderson) faith Sanderson.
as certain as Logic can make it, is not required in these, but only Ethicall
and Conjecturall faith, whereby we know things to be Lawful Negatively: Its
not required that we know them to be Positively conform to Gods Word.

Ans. If you ride ten miles with your friend and do not advise What certitude

with his word, who says ( Redeem the time) you must give account for idle
actions, if Christ say, you must give an account for idle Words. 2. Though
there seem to be more Liberty in actions of the second Table, then of the
first; because there be far more Positive actions, not merely Moral, which
concerns the second Table, because of Economy, Policy, Municipall and Civil
Laws, Arts, Sciences, Contracts amongst men, that are not in the first Table;
yet the Morallity of the second Table, is as expressly in Gods Word, as the
Worship of the first Table. 1. Because what is justice and mercy, and love
toward man in the second Table, does no more depend upon man's sole will, but
upon Gods Moral Law and the Law of nature, then it depends upon man's will or
human wisdom, how God should be worshipped according to the first Table. For
Gods will in his Word, is called by our Divines, a perfect Canon and rule of
Faith, and also of Manners: And as the grace of God, Tit 2. Tit. 2. 11. 12. The
Scripture a warrant for the morality of our acts of the second table, as for
the acts of worship.
teaches us what is Piety, so also what is Righteousness and Sobriety. 2.
Because as Gods Word condemns will worship, which is come of no Nobler blood,
then man's will, so condemns it idle words, and idle actions, which are but
will-works, and will-words, and deeds of will-justice, and will-mercy: and a
will-conscience in the second Table, puts no less a rub upon the wisdom of
the Lord, the Law*giver, then a will conscience in the first Table. But
Formalists say, If man's will and authority cannot appoint Crossing, Holy
humane-dayes, Surplice, and such, the decent expressions and incitements of
Devotion, in the kind of Arbitrary, Mutable, and Ambulatory Many actions of

Worship; but they must be therein guilty of adding to the Doctrine of Piety
and Religion in the first Table: by that same reason they cannot make humane
Civil and Positive Laws in War and Peace, to be means of conserving justice
and mercy tovvard humane societies in the kind of duties of Righteousness and
sobriety toward our selves and Neighbors; but they must be guilty of adding
to the Doctrine of the second Table. I Answer: 1. The case is not alike, we
cannot be Agents in the performing of any worship to God; nor can we use any
Religious means for honoring God, which belong to the first The contr^ry is
the clear judgment of Papists, as S^^rc^ teaches us, tom. de virt. et statu

Table: But in these we are Moral Agents, doing with special reference to
conscience, and to true happiness and the glory of God, as the ends both of
the work and workers: and therefore in these we are precisely ruled by the
wisdom of God, who has in his word set down what Worship, and what means of
exciting Devotion, and decoring of his Worship pleases him, and has not left
men to Lord-will, or Lord-wit; but in many actions that belong to humane
societies, we are not Moral Agents, but often Agents by Art, as in Military
discipline, Trades useful for man's life, Economy and Policy in Kingdoms and
Cities, in Sciences, as Logic, Physic, Mathematics, in these Finis operis,
the end of the work is operation, according to the principles of Arts and
Policy, and we are not in them Moral Agents, and so not to be regulated by
Gods Word.

For the Scripture gives not to us, precepts of Grammar, of War, of Trades,
and Arts, teaching us to speak right Latin, to make accurat demonstrations:
nor is the end of the work here a thing that pitcheth upon that tender and
excellentest piece in us, our Conscience, and our Moral duties to God and men,
but to make such humane Laws, just and suitable with sobriety and justice, is
not left to Lord-will, but right reason, the principles of a natural
Conscience (which are parts to us of Scripture) and the Word of God it self
has determined; whether, to carry Armor in the The Jesuit speaks of the
Ceremonies of Lutherans* and the Prelaticall faction in England.
night, in such a case? Whether to eat flesh in such a season of the year* when
the eating thereof hurts the Commonwealth, and the like belong to works of
justice and mercy, or no? Now it is no marvel that in things belonging to our
natural life, peace, societies, policy, where the end of the work is natural
or civil, and belongs not, as such, to the Conscience, and Salvation of the
soul, that there men be Artificers or Agents according to Art, Economy,
Policy, whereas the end of the work, Finis operis, in the Worship of God, is
Moral, and a matter of an higher nature; and so the means and manner of
Worship here, are determined by Gods Word. But when actions of Arts, Sciences,
Trades, Economy, Policy, and Laws positive, are elevated above themselves, Ad
finem operantium, to the end that Agents are to look unto, as they be Moral
Agents; Gods Word is as perfect a rule for acts of good manners in the second
Table, as in the first: For example, that I speak good Latin, I am to see to
Disputers Precepts; but that I lie not, and speak not Scandals or Blasphemies,
while I speak Latin, there I am to look to Gods Law given by Moses. That a
Tradesman make works according to Art, he is to advise with Art, but that he
sell not his work at too dear a price, he is to advise with the eight
Commandment; and when all these acts of Art are referred to Conscience*
Salvation, and the glory of God, as they ought to be Respectus finis operantis*
in respect of the Moral intention of the doer, all their Morallity is squared
by Gods-Word. Hence there be no actions of Worshipping God, but they be purely
Moral, Et respectu finis operis, Et respectu finis operantiis; but many
actions belonging to the second Table, are either purely not Moral, as actions
of mere Art, or they be mixed, and Respectu finis operis, in respect of the end
of the work, they are not Moral, nor to be squared by the Word at all; and in
respect of the Moral intention of the doer, they be Moral, and so mixed
actions, and partly ruled by the Word, and partly ruled by Art or Policy,
according to our seventh distinction.

II. Conclusion: In actions or Religious means of Worship, and actions Moral,
whatever is beside the Word of God, is against the What is beside the Word of
God in Morals, is contrary to the Word of God.
Word of God; I say in Religious means, for there be means of Worship, or
Circumstances Physical, not Moral, not Religious, as whether the Pulpit be of
stone or of timber, the Bell of this or this Metal, the house of Worship
stand thus or thus in Situation.

Our Formalists will have it in the power of rulers to Command in the matter of
Worship, that which is beside the Word of God, and so is negatively Lawful,
though it be not Positively conform to Gods Word, nor Commanded or warranted by
practice; which I grant is a witty way of Romes devising, to make entry for
Religious humane Ceremonies.

But 1. Whatever is not of Faith, and a sure persuasion, that what I do
pleases God, is sin, Romans 14. 14. 23. And therefore neither can be Commanded
by Rulers, nor practiced by inferiors: But things besides Scripture, and
negatively Lawful, are things not of Faith; Ergo, The Assumption I Prove: 1. I
doubt if Lord-will, be the Lord-carver, of what pleases God. 2. If it may
stand with the wisdom of Christ the Lawgiver; for no Ceremonies makes Christ
a perfect Lawgiver: 3. In things doubtsome, abstinence is the surest side;
Ergo; Rulers ought not to command them: 4. Samuel, David, even wicked Saul
abstained in things doubtsome, while the Oracle of God removed the doubts, and
answered him. 5. Paul in eating or not eating, which are things most
indifferent, requires a certain persuasion of positive assurance, Romans 14. 14.
I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of it
self, but to him that esteems any thing to be unclean, it is unclean.

Sanderson Sermo.
Master Sanderson says, In things substantial of Gods Worship, and in things
to be done upon necessity of salvation, what is not of Faith; certainly
assuring us it is conform positively to Gods word, it is sin, so we abhor
Popish Additions: But in the actions of our life, as the lifting of a straw,
and in Ceremonial worship, or accidentals, it holds not ( says Morton
Burges Supra.
Morton, and Doctor Burges) not in all particulars (says Paybod. par. 2. S.
14. p. 45.
Paybodie) for there should be no end (says D. Iackson on the Creed, l. 3. c*
7. p. 275.
Doct. Iackson) of doubting, for Papists might doubt to assist our King against
Roman Catholics.

Ans. 1. Let Formalists explain themselves; Doctrinals, Substantials, and
essential worship, is such as God has commanded in the Proposition, and in
the Assumption, and particularly in Gods word; Accidentals are such, as he has
commanded in general, but left particulars to men's will, so they define, like
M^sters of Arts.

But this our Masters say, in all that Christ has particularly Commanded, his
Testament is perfect, and so I believe, what God has set down, he has set
down, and so we have Scripture right down as perfect as the Fables of Esop, and
Nasoes Metamorphosis: what is in Esopes and Nasoes books, is in their books,
and what they command you, The vanity of the perfection of Scripture in
essentials, not in accidentals.
are with certainty of Faith to believe they command, and what the Prophets and
Apostles writ, that they writ, and that is essential worship; what they writ
not, they writ not. 2. Mr. Sandersons lifting up a straw, is a straw for an
instance; actions of imagination are not Moral, we give him leave to ruh his
beard without Faith, as he wears white sheets above his garments in Divine
service against Faith. 3. To do in Faith, is to know, that, in that I serve
Christ, and am accepted of God, Romans 14. 2. To do that which condemns me not,
and makes me happy in the doing thereof, v. 21. 3. It is a Faith that I have
before God in my conscience, v. 2^. 4. It is a persuasion by the Lord Jesus,
that it is clean. 5. It is such, as I know is positively Lawful by Scriptures
express warrant, 1* Cor. 10. 26. The earth is the Lords and the fullness
thereof; Ergo, I have certainty of faith, that it is positively conform to
Scripture what I do: but in things negatively Lawful, as lifting a straw,
wearing a Surplice, I have no persuasion by the Lord Jesus, that I serve
Christ, and am accepted of God in so doing, and know not from Psa. 24. 1. or
from any other scripture, that it is lawful what I do. 3. A general warrant
is either when the major Proposition only is sure by Scripture, but you must
take the Assumption upon the Formalists Merchant-word, or where both
Proposition and assumption can endure, (...) according as it is written; this
latter we embrace with both our hands, but Formalists deny it to us: The first
is their meaning. This, what is decent and not contrary to Gods Word, that the
Rulers may command: But Surplice, Crossing, etc. are decent and not contrary to
Gods Word; Ergo. So one Giles Widows Giles Widows, in his lawless kneelles
Puritan
says* Man and Wife are one flesh: Ergo, the Ring in Marriage is good. And,
Fine linen is the Righteousness of the Saints, Rev. 19. Ergo, a Surplice is
good. And, Matthew. 16. Take up your cross: Ergo, the Crossing in Baptism is
lawful. Enough of this* But so the worship of the Devil is lawful* and,
Aarons golden Calf is lawful; for I can find a major Proposition for them in
Scripture, of which you have a Faith both Negative and Positive; as this,
Whatever God (g) Bannes to. 3. 22. q. 1. art. 1. Omne quod non est ex fide,
idest, quod fit contra propriam conscienti^^ est peccatum.
commands in his Word, that is lawful: But God commands the Indians Devil
worship in his Word: Ergo, etc. I am not holden to give my Faith for the
Assumption: Yet it is as good as our Masters reasoning. 4. Jackson is wide in
his lawful Negatives, for to fight against Roman Catholics, at our Kings
Command, upon good grounds, is not an indifferent thing, Except to kill men,
and shed blood, be indifferent and lawful Negatively: I thought, to make War,
had been amongst the Substantials, and Positively conform to Gods Word. 5. The
Fathers, as Origin, Ambrose, Chrysostom, Theophylact, Oecumenius, Theodoret,
Anselm and Jerome, upon the place Romans 14. 23. as Vasquez says Vasquez to. 1.
12. dis. 59. q. 19. Art 6. c. 2.
from this place, Rom: 14* 23. that What any does, must be warranted by the
light of the conscience as lawful. If Formalist; stand to this, they must give
us some things against conscience, and something beside conscience, that is
morally lawful, and therefore if conscience see not such a thing against
Scripture, though it have no warrant in Scripture, yet it is lawful, and done
in a certain persuasion of a well informed conscience; but these who eat things
thought to be unclean by Gods Law, to the scandal of others, who knew these
meats were not against Piety and Gods Law, nor yet that the eating of them was
against charity, while Paul delivered the Doctrine of Scandal, yet their
eating was unlawful. 6. Formalists say nothing here, but what Papists said
before them, they say, Men may go to War, doubting of the lawfulness thereof;
and therefore Vasquez to. 1. disp. 65. c. 1.
Vasquez, Angelus verbo Dubium c. 1.
Angelus, Corduba l. 3. q. 4.
Corduba, and Navir. in cap. de Penitentia dub. 7. n. 8.

conscience ought to do: And Vasquez to. 1. disp. 66. cap. 9. Nec subditus
dubious de justitia belli potest parere, quamdiu dubious manet.
Vasquez says, Manente dubio, etc. To do so long as the doubt remains, is to
do against the judgment of conscience: And Adrianus in quod libet, punct. 2.
ad art. 2. Milites dubii cligerent sic partem dubiam and expo^erent se periculo
injuste occidendi et praedandi non eundo tantum pecearent non obediendo.
Adrianus says, While they doubt, and yet go to War, they expose themselves to
the danger of Manslaughter, and by not going to War, they should only sin by
not obeying. Suarez de Tripl. virt. Theol. Tract. 3. disp. 14. Sect. 6.
Suarez says, It is a speculative doubt, when Superiors commands it: And
Silvester verbo belli. 3. q. 1, c. 4.
Sylvester says, Such a doubt should be expelled at the commandment of
Superiors. And no marvel the command of Superiors to Papists is an Oracle, and
blind obedience is good meriting; therefore Gratian. d. 23. quest. 1. Quod

indifferent Ceremonies, is not of Faith, and so Sin. Ans. He that obeys
doubtingly, is condemned, and he that obeys not doubtingly, is condemned;
But, Master Doctor, your enumeration is not sufficient, and may strike against
doubting to worship a Romish Idol, at the command of Superiors; for I show you
a third, and its Paul's way, Eat not, obey not, and abstain with persuasion of
Faith, that what you do is agreeable Positively to Gods Word.

Jackson says, They sin, not by doubting, if the fear of evil after mature
deliberation, be not extraordinary, and such as cannot be recompensed by the
goodness which appears in the act of Obedience. Doubting is no internal part
or essential cause of sin, we sin not because we doubt, but because while
we doubt, we prefer an evil, or a less good, before a good, or a greater
good. So their sin was not doubting, but they preferred not eating, which
was a bodily loss only, to the evil feared, which was to be partakers of
the Table of Devils, and being Apostates from the Israel of God. Ans. Paul
expressly says, doubting is sin, and condemns it ver. 23. and requires, ver.
5. Let every man be persuaded in his conscience, v. 21. Happy is he that
condemns not himself in that which he allows, v. 23. Whatsoever (more or
less in Moral actions) is not of Faith, is sin: 2. Internal persuasion, Romans
14. 14. Is an internal cause of obedience, as v. 21. And therefore doubting
being a sin that condemns, Romans 14. 23. must be such a sinful ingredient, as
makes the action sinful. 3. We both sin, because we doubt, and also because
we prefer a less Doubting condemns.

whether of sin or punishment if it follow not kindly, but only by accident, and
through the corruption of our nature, should or can make us do any thing
doubtingly or sinfully, for then we might do evil, that good might come of it:
No good of obedience can warrant me to sin, and disobey God, nor should that be
called obedience, nor is it obedience to men, which is disobedience to God. 5.
It is an untruth that non-eating was only a bodily loss, for non-eating
Physical, is a bodily loss, but Paul urges non-eating moral, to eschew the
fall of one for whom Christ died. 6. The Doctor says Ibidem. No power under
the Heaven could make a Law over the Romans, injoyning such meats, because Gods
law (as they conceive) condemned them. Now how pleasant are right words? I
assume, we conceive God has denounced all the plagues written in his Book,
upon practisers of humane Ceremonies, as upon adders to the word of God, Rev.
22. 19. Yea Heresies, to with, that Christ is not the consubstantiall Son of
God, may seem probable to us; shall the good of obedience in believing my
Pastor, whom God has set over me, hinder me to obey? 7. Papists say also, that
Scripture is perfect in general, allowing that Ceremonies should be, when
Papists say the Srcipture in general is perfect, but not in particulars of
worship, and so say Formalists.
Paul says, Let all things be done in order and decency, 1 Cor. 14. But the
Scripture gives no particular warrant for these, but only the Churches
determination. So Scotus, Prolog. in senten. q. 3. ad art. 3. Terminus
praefixus [Theologiae] quantum ad revelationem* Divinam est ^orum qu^ ^u^^
in^sadra Scriptura, sicut habetur ult. Apocalypse. Si quis ^pposucrit ad ista,

ipsis

Bannes, And Duvallius in 2. Thomae. tract. de legib. q. 5. Art. 1. ad Arg. 2.
Scriptura est sufficiens, quia ipsa omnia, tam ered^^da quam agenda impli^ite
contineat, and propterea express ad Ecclesiam tanquam ad Columnam veritatis,
tam in fide, quam in preceptis been vivendi nos remittit.
and Duvallius. The Scripture implicitly, and generally contains all the
substantials necessary for salvation, but not traditions in particular, that is
the Churches part, just as Formalists say, order and decency is commanded in
the word, but Crossing, Surplice, Humane days and such are left to the
Prelates Calendar, to fill up what his Lordship thinks good. So Hooker (c)
Speech is necessary, but it is not necessary that all speak one kind of
Language, Government is necessary, but the particulars, Surplice, Crossing,
etc. Are left to the Church.

2. What is negatively Lawful here, cannot be admitted; If What is only
negative in Gods worship, cannot be commanded.
Rulers may Command one thing that is negatively Lawful, they may Command all
things; because what they Command under this formal reason, as not against
Scripture, they should not add nor devise new worship, though they Command all
of that kind: But the latter is absurd, for so they might Command in Gods
worship. 1. The actions of sole imagination, the lifting of a straw, and all
idle actions that cannot edify. 2. They might Command a new Ark to represent
Christ incarnat, as the Jews Ark did represent him to be incarnat, a new
Passover, to represent the Lamb already slain, and all the materials of the
Ceremonial Law with reference to Christ already incarnat, dead, and risen
again: For all these are by Formalists Learning negatively Lawful; Show us a
Scripture where they are forbidden, more then Surplice, Crossing, except
because they be not Commanded. If it be said, They do not Command things
negatively Lawful, as such, but as they edify and teach: Well then, 1. As
they edify and teach, they are positively good, and apt to edify, and so must
be proved by the Word as Commanded, and so not negatively Lawful, and not as
beside, but as Commanded in the Word. 2. Yet it will follow, that all these may
be used in Faith, that is, out of a sure persuasion that they are not contrary
to Gods Word, and so Lawful. I might dance in a new linen Ephod, before a new
Jewish Ark, representing Christ already incarnat, and that in the negative
Faith of Mr. Sanderson, Hooker, and Jackson, for this Ark is not against
Scripture, yet this Ark is not Commanded, and so not forbidden. 3. Idle actions
that have no use or end, might be Lawfully Commanded by this, because they are
not forbidden, yet are such unlawful, Quia carent justa necessitate et
utilitate, as Gregorius says: I prove the connection, because an action Moral,
such as ( to Sign with the Cross) performed by a Subject of Christ's visible
Kingdom, for Gods glory and edification of the Church, which yet is neither
Commanded nor forbidden by God, nor Commanded by natures light (for none but
those that are beside reason will say this) nor light of Gods word, or the
habit of Religion, has no more reason, then the making or forming a Syllogism
in Barbara, which of it self comes only from Art; and as such has no Moral
use, and by as good reason may the Church Command dancing before a new devised
Ark; yea, such an action involveth a contradiction, and is Moral, and not
Moral: for of its own nature it tends to no edification, for then it might
be proved by good reason to be edificative, and an action cannot be edificative
from the will of men, for Gods will, not men's will* gives being to things.

4. What is beside Scripture, as a thing not repugnant thereunto, wants that
by which every thing is essentially Lawful: Ergo, It is not Lawful. The
Consequence is sure, I prove the Antecedent: Gods Commanding will, does
essentially constitute a thing Lawful, Gods Commanding will only makes eating
and drinking bread and wine in the Lords Supper Lawful, and the Lords
forbidding will should make it unlawful; and Gods forbidding to eat of the
Fruit of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, makes the non-eating
obedience, and the eating disobedience. As the killing of Isaac by Abraham, is
Lawful, and that because God Commands it; and the not killing of him, again
is Lawful, when God forbids it. But things negatively Lawful and beside
the word of God, wants Gods Commanding will; for God Commands not the
materials of Jewish Ceremonies to represent Christ already come, and such like:
for if he should Command them, they should be according to the word of God, and
not beside the word of God: If it be said they have Gods Commanding will, in so
far that he does not forbid any thing not contrary to his own word; but has
given the Church Authority to add to his worship, things not contrary to his
word, as they shall see they do promove godliness, or may edify the Church:
But then if the Church must see by the light of reason, and natural judgment,
aptitude in these to promove godliness, they are Commanded by God, who has
even stamped in them that aptitude to edify, and so are not beside Gods word.
4. Our Divines condemn all the Traditions of the Church of Rome; as Purgatory,
Prayer for the dead, Imagery, Adoring of Relics, all the Crossing, Holy
water, Chrisme, Oil, Babies, Bells, Beads, etc. Because God has no where
Commanded them, and sins venial and beside the Law, and sins mortal and
contrary to the Law, we condemn; because, as what is capable of seeing, and
life, Opinion of sanctity and Divine necessity, not essential to false worship.
and hearing, and yet does not see, live, nor hear, that in good reason we call
blind, dead, and deaf; all beside the word are capable of Moral goodness,
and yet not Morally good, because not warranted by Gods word, therefore they
must be Morally evil.

III. Conclus. Opinion of Sanctity, holiness and Divine necessity, is not
essential to false worship. Formalists will have their Ceremonies innocent and
Lawful, so they be not contrary to the word of God. 2. So they be not
instamped with an opinion that they bind the Conscience, and are of Divine
necessity, holiness and efficacy; So Morton, Innocence of ceremonies general
defense c. 1. S. 15.
Morton their Prelat, for opinion of justice, necessity, efficacy and merit,
(says he) make them Doctrinals and so unlawful: But this is but that which
Papists say: So Suarez Suarcz, to. de trip. vi^t. theol. tract. 1. dis. 5. S.
4. Haec vero and similia (traditionalia non scripta) non adduntur scripturis ut
fiant qua^i parts ^jus (quod potest etiam censeri prohibitum) sed adduntur ut
cr^denda and servanda.
says, That their unwritten Traditions are not added to the word of God, as
parts of the word of God; but as things to be believed and observed by the
Churches Commandment; and these who did swear by Jehovah and Malcom, Zeph. 1.
esteemed Malcom, and an oath by Malcom, not so Religiously and so holy, as an
oath by Jehovah and Malcom; and yet no doubt, they ascribed some necessity to
oaths by Malcom and Jehoram saying, ( Am I Jehovah to kill and make alive) who
yet worshipped Ieroboams Calves, esteemed the worshipping of these Calves less
necessary, and less holy and meritorious, then the worshipping of the true
Yehovah; yet the Calves called their gods, which brought them out of the Land
of Egypt, had some necessity and opinion of holiness.

For 1. Aaron in making a Calf, and Proclaiming a Feast to the Calf, committed
false worship; but Aaron placed not holiness, justice, or merit in that
worship: Because, Exodus 32. 22. for fear of the people who in a tumult gathered
themselves together against him, he committed that Idolatry; Ergo, necessity of
Sanctity, Merit, and Divine obligation, is not essential to false worship:
Jeroboam Committed Idolatry in saying, These are thy Gods O Israel; but he
placed no efficacy or merit therein, because, 1 King. 12. 27. He did it, least
the people going to Jerusalem, should return to Rehoboam, and kill him; And the
Philistims dis-worship in handling the Ark unreverently, had no such opinion,
they doubting whither God or Fortune ruled the Ark, 1 Samuel 6. 9. It were
strange if these who say in their heart, There is no God, Ezech. 9. 9. Psalm.
94. 6. And so fail against inward worship due to God, should think that the
denying of God were service and meritorious service to God; and that Peter
denying Christ, and Iudaizing, Gal. 2. 12. for fear, thought and believed he
did meritorious service to Christ therein: Pilate in condemning Christ; Judas
in selling him; the Soldiers in scourging him, did dis-worship to their
Creator, the Lord of glory: Shall we think that Pilate, who for fear of the
people did this* believed he was performing necessary, Divine and Meritorious
worship to God? 2. If opinion of necessity Divine, of Merit and sanctity, as
touching the conscience, were essential to false worship; it were impossible
for gain and glory, to Commit Idolatry, to preach lies in the Name of the Lord
for a handful of barley, as Ezekiel. 13. 19. Mic. 3. 5. 1 Kin. 22. 6. 1 Timothy 4*1,
2. Tit. 1. 11. For its a contradiction to Preach Arrianisme, Turcisme, Popery,
against the light of the mind only for gain; and yet to think that in so
doing, they be performing meritorious service to God: Yea, they who devise
will worship, know their own will to be the Lord-carver of that worship, at
least they may know it; yet shall we think they hold themselves necessitated,
by a Religious obligation so to do? Else it were impossible, that men could
believe the burning their Children were will worship, indifferent and Arbitrary
to the worshippers, which is open war against reason: Now a worship cannot be
false, wanting that which is essentaill to false worship. 3. False worship is
false worship by order of nature, before we have any opinion, either that there
is Religious necessity in it, or mere indifferency: Ergo, Such an opinion is
not of the essence of false worship. 4. By that same reason, opinion of
unjustice, or opinion of doing justice, should be of the essence of unjustice;
Cains killing of his Brother, should not be Manslaughter, except Cain placed
some divine Sanctity in that wicked fact, which is against all reason; and the
reason is alike in both Gods Commanding will and his forbidding will. They
Answer, Gods will constituteth Lawfulness in essential worship, and man's will
in things arbitrary; but this is to beg the question, for when we ask what is
essential worship, they say, it is that which God commands, and what is
accidental or arbitrary, it is that which human authority commands, and this
is just, Gods will is the essential cause of that worship whereof it is the
essential cause, and man's will is the essential cause of that, whereof it is
the essential cause. 5. All the materials of Jewish and Turkish worship, might
be appointed for right worship, so we held them to be Arbitrary. 6. God cannot
forbid false worship, but in that tenure, that he commands true worship; but
whether we esteem it true, or not, holy, or not; he commands true worship,
Erg. etc.

IV. Conclusion, It is a vain and unwarrantable distinction to divide The
distinction of worship essential and accidental of Gods general and
particular will is to be rejected.
worship in essential, which has Gods; 1. Particular approving will to be the
Warrant thereof, and worship accidental or Arbitrary, which has only Gods
general and permissive will, and has man's will for its father; so Ceremonies
(say they) In these, has Gods general will, according to their specification,
whether a Surplice be decent, or not, is from man's will, therefore they are
called worship reductively, because in their particulars, they have no Divine
institution, and they tend to the honoring of God, not as worship, but as
adjuncts of worship; so Morton gener. def. cap. 1. S. 22.
Morton; so Burges Treatise of kneeling. cap. 2. p. 2.
Burges.

Ans. As Sacramental worship is lawful essential worship, so that this
element, bread and wine, and this water is not Arbitrary; Ergo, If decency be
of divine institution, and Gods approving will, then that Surplice or Crossing,
or not Surplice and Crossing be decent, is not Arbitrary, and only from Gods
permitting will: If the general must be warranted by the word, so also
specials under the general, else men's will may make a horned Bullock a decent
Sacrifice to represent Christ already come in the f^^sh; for if the written
word warrant not the specials of Religious observances, a door is open for all
humane inventions: The uniting of these two ( The Crossing of the finger in the
Air above a childs face) and (the dedication of the child to Christ's service)
are every way like to the uniting, Of Bread and Wine eaten and drunken, and the
souls nourishing by Christ crucified and apprehended by Faith: If there be
odds, it is in the Authority of the institutors: Our Formalists say, the one
is essential, because ordained by Christ, and so binds the conscience, and
the other Arbitrary, accidental and of less authority: We owe them thanks
indeed, the sin is the greater that the Authority is the less, but the
external worship is alike. There be odds betwixt the kissing of a wife by a
stranger, and the kissing by her own husband, and odds betwixt an act of
Royal Majesty performed by the King, and that same Act performed by a Traitor
faining the same Act, as there be odds betwixt money stricken by a Tinker, and
by the Kings master of Coin; will this distinction serve the whorish woman,
the kisses of a strange man be Arbitrary, indifferent and accidental: but the
kisses of my own husband be essential and kindly. And the Tinker might save
his head for his false coin, the Kings money is essentially Legal and
current, but money stricken by me, is Arbitrary and of less Authority, then the
Kings Lawful Coin. 2. If it be necessary and good to honor God by decency and
order, the particular goodness and holiness of Surplice and Crossing is also
good and holy. But God has particularly, Micah 6. 8. Showed thee what is good
O man; Ergo, he has also showed what is particularly holy. But God has not
showed us in his Word any goodness in Crossing, Surplice, because they are of
man's devising: If it be said, the particular goodness of Surplice and Crossing
is good and showed to us in the general. I Answer, goodness of indifferent
Rites, is, Repugnantia in adjecto, and a flat contradiction, as who would say,
cold fire, indifferent is neither good nor evil, neither Lawful, nor
unlawful: 2. Then God has not showed us all Moral goodness in his word,
because he has not showed to us the goodness of Ceremonies. 3. Lawfulness is
an essential property of Divine worship resulting from Gods particular
approving will in his word, as is clear, Hosea 8. 5. 1 Chro. 15. 13. Lev. 10.
1. 2 Samuel 7. 7. Ier. 7. 30. Act. 15. 24. Ergo, Arbitrary worship must have Gods
approving will, commanding it, else it is not Lawful: I prove the Antecedent
from the causes of worship: 1. The end of worship, which is the honoring of
God makes not worship Lawful; Idolaters may intend to honor God in their
Idolatry, as well as true worshippers. 2. The matter of worship is not
essential to Lawful worship, for Lawful and unlawful worship may have the
same common matter, as Solomon's Calves in the Temple were lawful, because
ordained of God, and Samaria's Calves were unlawful, because they were from
men, the matter of both might be one and the same metal, Hosea 8. 3. The Form
of worship in general, is not the essential and specifice Form of Lawful
worship, as the specifice Form of a living creature is not the specifice form
of a man, the specifice form of a man is not the specifice form of a just man,
as just. Also I may conceive Sacramental eating in general, and not conceive
whether it be Lawful or unlawful: For if Lawfulness were the specifice form
of worship, I could not conceive worship, but I behooved to conceive
Lawfulness in it. Now then Gods commanding will, being wanting to Arbitrary
worship, it cannot be Lawful; Ergo, unlawful. If it be answered, Ceremonies
are negatively lawful, not positively lawful, and the Argument proceeds of
Lawfulness positive, which is commanded in the word. But this is, 1. a begging
of the question. 2. Negative Lawfulness, is from man's will, which should not
be a Creatrix of the goodness of things or of Lawfulness, nor can it Create
goodness, except you make man to be God: 4. Arbitrary goodness and
Lawfulness has either a particular warrant and cause of its goodness, and
Lawfulness from Gods express Commandment, or 2. From the light of nature, or
3. From the sole will of men, or 4. partly from natures light, partly from man's
will, but any of these ways it cannot be Lawful, I prove the Antecedent: for
it cannot have its warrant from Gods general will whereby the Proposition of a
Syllogism is warranted, but not the Assumption* for thu^ the golden Calse of
Jeroboam; the worshipping of Satan should be lawful: for I can form a
Syllogism to it from Scripture ( all worship commanded in the Word is Lawful*
but Ieroboams golden Calf is Commanded in the Word; Ergo, It is Lawful. And if
both Major* Proposition and Assumption be warranted by the Word, then are
Ceremonies essential and not Arbitrary worship. If Ceremonies be warranted by
the light of nature, this is a part of Gods Word, and Romans 1. 19, 20. God has
showed it to us, as, Romans 2. 14, 15. We would see natures light to prove that
whiteness of linen signifies Pastoral holiness, rather then whiteness in
the wall, and that the cross signifies dedication of a child to Christ's
service, rather then lifting up of the child toward Heaven signifies the
same; and yet Ceremonie^ must be by this reason essential worship; yea, to
Sacrifice a sheep to represent Christ already Crucified* is as Lawful this way
as all our Ceremonies. If the third be said, that Ceremonies have their
goodness and Lawfulness from the sole will of men; then Ceremonies are
Will Worship: for worship instituted by the sole will of men, without light of
Scripture, or nature, is Will Worship. 2. The devisers of them are either
Brutish, or void of reason, and the practicers are servants of men, because
they serve will, or rather lust of men, without any reason Commanding. 3. If
Ceremonies come partly from men's will, partly from the light of reason* then do
they conclude the Lawfulness of Ceremonies either ^allibly or necessarily: If
the former be said, we have little warrant of conscience to practice them; nor
can God be honored, nor these things Lawful, good, and edificative, more then
unlawful, evil and unapt to edify, seeing there be no light of Scripture, or
nature to make them good to us* and because a fallible and unnecessary
consequence, is over fallible and unnecessary, and stands (as Aristotle faith
well) in an indivisible point. It is a non-consequence, and so men's will is the
best house that Ceremonies are descended of. If they can be proved by a
necessary and infallible consequence, we desire to hear it, for it must be thus
or the like: Things not contrary to the Word, and commanded as apt to edify,
may be Lawful Arbitrary Worship: But Ceremonies are such; Ergo, the
Proposition is not true* because Rulers judge either such things apt to edify,
because they see them to be so in themselves, or because they judge them to be
so in themselves, therefore they are so in themselves: the former cannot be
said, because this light whereby Rulers see Ceremonies to be apt to edify, is
either light of Scripture, or nature, or both: If this be said, they can make
others see this light. Also, if there be goodness and aptitude to edify souls
in Ceremonies by natures light, sound reason, or the Word of God, they cannot
be Arbitrary or indifferent worship: but must be essential worship, having
warrant and Commandment from God* for what natures light, or Scripture
Commands, that God himself Commands, and what God Commands is essential,
not Arbitrary worship. 2. And secondly, they are not Arbitrary things, but
necessary and Lawful by natures light, by Scripture, or both, which they deny;
if the latter be true, then is the will of Rulers, that which makes Ceremonies
good and Lawful* a^^in and blasphemous assertion, for Pope or Prince, or men's
pleasure find pre-existent goodness and Lawfulness in things, and they do
not make them good: It is proper to God alone, who calls things that are not,
to create both beings and goodness of beings. 5. If Arbitrary goodness and
Lawfulness of Ceremonies be thus warrantable, because nor contrary to the
word, and esteemed Arbitrary; I might fail against the first four Commandments,
by superstition and idolary: so I esteem these, to wit, Idolatry and
superstition Arbitrary, and not of Divine necessity, and yet in so doing, I
should neither sin, nor commit acts of false worship; because superstition and
Idolatry are indeed forbidden, but superstition and Idolatry, with the opinion,
that they have neither holiness, merit, nor Divine necessity, but are merely
Arbitrary, are no where forbidden in the word. Let Formalists by their grounds,
show us a Scripture for it; for they cannot by their Doctrine be forbidden as
false worship, seeing they want that which essentially constituteth false
worship (as they teach) for they (as the Argument supposes) want opinion of
necessity, Divine merit and holiness. 6. If the Churches will, commanding
Crossing, and Surplice, make them Lawful; then their forbidding them shall
make them unlawful, and man's will shall be a Pope and God. 7. If Rulers
conclude them Lawful, then either upon National reasons concerning Britain
rather then other Nations, or upon reasons immutable and eternal* if the latter
be said, they be essential worship, not Arbitrary* if the former be said, they
be more apt to stir up the dull senses of British men, then othe^s, which is a
dream. Dull senses are alike every where, sin original alike in all places,
and God in his perfect word has provided alike remedies against natural
dullness to all mankind, else we in Britain do supererogate, and the word*
must be perfect to some Nations, in that which is common to all, and not to
others. 8. By as good reason, Arbitrary mercy, and Arbittary justice is holden
as Arbitrary worship; for the Lords word is as perfect in works of charity for
the second Table, as in works of Religion for the first, and if so be, then it
were in men's will to do things conducing for the murdering, or not murdering
of our brethren, of their own wit and will, without the word of God, and there
should be some lawful acts of will-love, or will-murther. 9. Laws oblige (as
Papists grant) as Driedo de Libert Christ. l. 3. c. 3. ad arg. 3. Non est in
potestate legislatoris prout voluerit obligare ad mortale and veniale sed hoe
provient ex materiaegravitate.
Driedo, and Vasquez Tom. 2. in 12. disput. 154. c. 3. Neque enim in voluntate
legislator is est obligare vel non obligare.
Vasquez say, after Gerson, Occam, Almain, and other Papists, from the
goodness of the matter commanded in the Law, not from the will of the
Lawgiver: If then the general will and command of God constitute Arbitrary
worship, this worship from Gods will lays a band on the conscience, no less
then essential worship: For Hezechiah is no less obliged in conscience to
apply Figs to his boil, and Moses to make every little ring in the Tabernacle:
when God commands these, then the Prophets are to write Canonick Scripture:
for Gods Authority in Commanding, is equal in all, though in respect of the
matter, there be great things, and less things of the Law: therefore Gods
general permissive-will, does no less oblige the conscience, then his
approving will. 10. To this Arbitrary worship agrees all the properties of
will worship; as 1 Colos. 2. 18. It beguileth us of our reward; for no promise
of God is made of a Bishopric for conformity* 2. It is will-humility, to be
devouter then God wills us. 3. It intrudeth in things not known in the word.
4. It holds not the head Christ, for it makes him not a perfect Lawgiver,
if Prelares under him give Laws added to his word, and that after the
Traditions of men. 5. It inthralleth men dead with Christ, to a yoke. They
object, But not to yoke upon the conscience. Answer; yea, but we are in Christ
freed also from the external yoke, as from shedding of blood in Circumcision,
removal out of the Camp seven days, many Ceremonial Sabbaths, presenting of
the male-children, and going up to sacrifica at Jerusalem; yea, expensive
offerings, all called burdens, Act. 15. 10. Col. 2. 20. Gal* 4. 3, 4, 5. Col.
2. 14. 15. And multiplied holy days, Surplice, Crossing, keeping us in that
same bondage; though less (they may say) Magis, and minus non variant speciem.
6. This worship perishes with the use: 7. Subjecteth us to the Ordinances of
men. 8. Has a show of wisdom, Mr. Burges Burges rejoynd c. 2. S. 7. p. 179.
says, Some will worship i^ not unlawful, a^ three Sermons in one day. The
free will offerings and vows were in some sort vvill-Worship. The Church at
her godly discretion, and will, may appoint some Formalities to attend the
Worship. Answer, Gregor* de valent says, That some Idolatry is Lawful, some
unlawful: This man says, some will worship is lawful, some unlawful, that
is, some sin is Lawful, some unlawful: 2. Three preachings come from zeal,
not from will, and is no new worship different from preaching, and there may be
reason therefore, where all cannot be present in one day at all the three,
there is reason for three preachings, none for Crossing: 3. Will as will, is
carver of will worship: Will creates not the worship, but determines the
circumstances according to the light of reason, in Lawful worship. But where
will, as will, void of reason has influence in the worship, it is wills brood:
4* The Freewill offerings were determined by God, the poor should offer a pair
of Doves, in the Free Will offering: But the rich a Lamb, and it was sin for
the rich to offer a pair of doves, and therefore will was not determinatrix in
this. 5. The man jumbleth together godly discretion and will: they be much
different; but for godliness in short sleeves, and Crossing a finger in the
Air, I understand it not, nor can reason dream of any warrant for it, but
will, as will, that is, man's lust made it.

Neither do Formalists go from Suarez de relig. to. 2. de houest v^ti lib. 1.
c. 1. n. 8. 9.
Suarez, and Bellar. de esfic. Sacram. l. 2 c. 32. ad arg. 2.
Bellarmine, who call that will worship, which is devised only by a man^ wit,
and is not conform to the principles of Faith, and wants all reason, and the
received use of the Church.

But we are disputing here against the Churches use, as if it were not yet a
received use. But upon these grounds I go: 1. Reason not binding and strongly
concluding, is no reason, but mere will. So Ceremonies have no reason: If the
reason bind, they are essential worship: 2. Authority is only ministerial in
ordering Gods worship, and has no place to invent new worship. 3. Authority as
Authority especially humane, gives no light, nor no warrant of conscience to
obey, and therefore authority naked and void of scriptures-light is here
bastard authority. 11. In all this Formalists but give the Papists distinction
of Divine and Apostolic Traditions: for power of inventing Ceremonies to them
is Apostolic, but not infallible and Divine: Suarez de tripl. virtut. tract.

Suarez gives the difference: God says he, Is the Immediate Author of Divine
Traditions, and the Apostles only publishers: But the Apostles are immediate

Duname 3 Book p. 153.
Hooker Sutluvius, de Presbyt. c. 11. p. 67.
Sutluvius; But I like better what Cyprian epist. 74. Vnde ista traditio? etc.
si in Evangelio praecipitur, aut in Apostolorum Epistolis, aut actibus
continetur, and observetur Divina et sanctahaes traditio. The distinction of
divine and of Apostolic Traditions rejected.
Cyprian says, That no Tradition, but what is in the word of God, is to be
received: But this distinction is blasphemous, and contrary to Scripture, 1
Cor* 14* 57. The things* that I write unto you: (even of decency and order, as
v. 29. 40.) Are the Commandment of the Lord, 2. Pet. 3. 2. Peter wills them
to be mindful of the words which were spoken before, by the holy Prophets,
and of the Commandments of us the Apostles of the Lord and S^vio^^: Then the
Apostles Commandments are equal with the Commandments of the Prophets. But in
the Old Testament, there were not some Traditions Divine, and some not every
way Divine, but Prophetical, for the Prophets were the mouth of God, as is
clear, 2 Pet. ^. 19, 20, 21. Luke 1. 70. Romans 1. 2. So 1 Timothy 6. 13. I give
thee charge in the sight of God -- 14. That thou keep this Commandment without
spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of the Lord Jesus. Now the Commandment
(as Beza Beza an in loc.
notes) Are all that he writ of discipline, which Formalists say, are for the
most Apostolic, but not Divine Traditions. 2. If Ceremonies seem good to the
holy Ghost* as they say they do from Act. 15. then they must seem good to the
Father and the Son, as the Canon is Act. 15. But that Canon was proved from
express Scripture; as Peter proves, v. 7, 8, 9. and James v. 13, 14, 15, 16.
If they come from the Spirit, inspiring the Apostles, they cannot err in such
Traditions; If from the spirit guided by the holy Ghost, they come from
Scripture. 3. If these traditions come from no spirit led by light of
Scripture, we shall not know, whether they be Lawful, or not, for the
Scripture is a Canonick rule of lawful and unlawful. 4. If any Apostolic
spirit be given to Authors of Ceremonies, why not also in preaching and
praying? How then do many of them turn Arminians, Papists, Socinians? 5. The
Apostolic spirit leading institutors of Ceremonies, does either infuse light
natural, supernatural, or Scripturall in devising Ceremonies, and so Eatenus,
in so far they were essential worship* or the Apostolic spirit does lead them,
with no light at all, which is brutish Enthusiasme: or 3. Gods Apostolic
spirit infuseth the general equity, and negative Lawfulness of these truths (
Surplice is an Apostolical sign of Pastoral holiness) and ( Crossing a
sign of Dedication of a child to Christ's service) Now light, for this we
would exceedingly have. If this light be immediately infused, then Surplice,
Crossing are as Divine, as if God spoke them; for truths immediately inspired
lost no divinity, because they come through sinful men; for Balaam his
Prophecy of the star of Jacob, was as Divine, in regard of Authority, as if
God had spoken it, but if these trash come from an inferior spirit, we desire
to know what spirit speaks without the word. But some may object; The
preaching of the word is somewhat humane, because its not from the infallible
spirit that dited the word; Ergo, Ceremonies may come from the holy Spirit,
though they be not as lawful as Scripture. Ans. Let them be proved to be from
the warrant, that the word is preached, and we yield to all* 5. Apostolic
Ceremonies, but not Divine have Gods general allowing will for the accepting
of them. Now Sampsons mother, Judge. 13. 23. proves well, The Lord has
accepted our offering; Ergo, it is Lawful, and he will not kill us. So God
atcepted Abel, and Noah their Sacrifices; Ergo, they were Lawful, and Divine
worship. So Hosea 8. 8. They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of my
offerings, and they eat it, but the Lord accepts them not. Ergo, offerings of
flesh without offering of themselves as living sacrifices to God are now
unlawful: If God accept of Ceremonies, they must be Divine service, if he
accept them not, they must be unlawful. They Answer, He accepts them as
Arbitrary worship, not as essential: I Answer, God might have accepted so
Sampsons sacrifice, and Noah's, as arbitrary worship, and yet not be gracious to
them, nor reward their sacrificing, as good service, contrary to the Texts
alleged; but I doubt much, if the Lord be gracious to men, and accept in
Christ corner Caps, Surplice, Crossing, humane holy days.

They object, Our Circumstances of time, place, persons, etc. are no more
warranted by the Scripture, then Ceremonies are. And God might in his wisdom
(^aith Burges rejoinder, cap. 1. Sect. 16. p. 90. Circumstances not positive
religious observances as Ceremonies are.
Burges) have calculated the order of times and places, such climats and
seasons; but he has left these, as he has left our Ceremonies to the Churches
liberty.

Ans. Time and place (as I observed already) being circumstances Physical, not
Moral, nor having any Religious influence to make the worship new and
different in nature, from that which is commanded in the Law, though they be
not expressly in the Word, do not hinder, but you may say, Such an act of
worship is according as it is written: for as Praying, Preaching, hearing, is
according as it is written: so is Praying and Preaching in this convenient
place, proved by that same Scripture ( As it is written) but one and the same
Scripture does not warrant Order and Surplice. 2. The question is not, what
Gods wisdom can do, for he could setdown all the names of Preaching Pastors,
Doctors, Deacons, Elders in the Word; but his wisdom thus should have made ten
Bibles more then there be: But all our Ceremonies might have been Comprehended
in one Chapter of the Revelation, if God had thought good to Honor them with
inserting them in the Canon. 3. He has determined these by natures light, and
prudence, which dwells with that light, revealed in the Word; That a Bishop
be thus qualified, as 1 Timothy 3. is Moral and determined; but that they call
him John, Thomas, and be of such Parents, Country, stature of body, is
Physical and in Christ's wisdom, is not determined, nor could it be
conveninetly. Lastly, that general permissive will of God, is good, for all
the Ceremonies of Rome, taught by Papists; As for ours, as Suarez de Trip lic.

V. Conclus. Matters of fact are not, and need not be proved by Scripture: 1.
Because sense makes them known to us. 2. Their Morality is sufficiently known
from Gods Word. 3. In matters offact there may be invincible ignorance: Christ's
Resurrection is not a matter of fact, as Hogo Grotius de jure belli, l. c. 20.
n. 48.
Hugo Grotius says, but also a matter of Law, as all the miracles and
Histories in the Word, and to be believed, because God has so spoken in the
Word.

QUEST. III.
Whether Ceremonies have any Divinity in them?

ALL means of worship devised by men pretending holiness, by Arg. 4. Against
humane Ceremonies, because they usurp the essential properties of Divine
ordinances.
teaching, exciting our dull affections to Devotion, as if they were powerful
means of grace, and did lay a band on the conscience, when as yet they be no
such thing, and want all warrant from God, and are contrary to devotion, are
unlawful.

But humane Ceremonies be such: Ergo,

The Proposition is certain: I prove the Assumption by parts: 1. Whatever
holiness be pretended to be in Ceremonies; yet God only sanctifies people,
offices in his house, as the sons of Aaron, Altars, Temples, Vestures,
Sacrifices by his express institution, as we are taught, Levit. 20. 8. Exodus
20. 11. 16, 17. Exodus 29. 29. 33. 36, 37. Exodus 40. 9. cap. 2. 10. cap. 26. 1,
2, 3. cap. 27. 1, 2.
yet are Ceremonies holy; their Author be the Apostles successors. 2. Their
end to honor God. 3. Their matter is not civil or natural. 4. Their
signification mystical, is Religious. 2. They be means of teaching and
stirring up the dull affections to the remembrance of duties, by some notable
and special signification, whereby the beholders may be edified; and since to
stir up the mind, as a memorative object be the word of Gods due property, or
the works of Providence and Creation; would not a Prelat in his Epistle to his
under-Pastors, speak Peter-like, as, 2 Pet. 1. 13. I think it meet, so long as
I am in this Tabernacle, to stir up your dull minds, by way of remembrance to
your Christian duty, by Crossing, kneeling to Gods board and Altar, and
Surplice; To be memorials were due to Phylacteries Commanded in the Law, to
mind heavenly duties, Numb. 15. 38, 39. Deuteronomy. 22. 12. And the twelve stones
set up by Gods special Commandment, Ioshu. 4. 2, 3. to be a memorial of their
miraculous entry into the holy Land, and Manna Commanded to be kept in the Ark,
as a sign of Gods feeding his people with Christ the bread of life, Joh. 6. 48,
49. 51. are Ordinances of God, to call to remembrance duties and special
mercies: And Sacraments do signify as tokens ordained of God, Genesis 17. 11.
Genesis 9. 13. Heb. 9. 8. The Holy Ghost thus signifying, that the way to the
holiest, was not yet made manifest: So Heb. 8. 5. Heb. 10. 1. And so must it be
here said. The holy Prelates thus signifying, that Crossing should betoken the
childs dedication to Christ's service: So Hooker, Book 3. p. 129.
Hooker: Actions leave a more deep and strong impression then the word. What
blasphemy? that Crossing and Surplice leave a deeper impression in the soul,
then Gods Word, the power of God to salvation, Romans 1. 16. And mighty through
God to cast down strong holds in the soul, 2 Cor. 10. 4? I wonder if Crossing
Capping; kneeling to stocks, can bring every thought Captive to the Obedience
of Christ. 3. It is essential to the word to teach, and make wise the simple,
Psalm. 19. 7. Psalm. 119. 99. Prove. 6. 23. And Ceremonies are made Symbolicall
and Religious teaching signs, yet is the stock called a Doctrine of lies, Jer.
10. 8. Habac. 2. 18. Though it teach and represent the same Jehovah that the
Word teaches, Isa. 40. 18. So it is not a living teacher, because it
represents a false god, or not the true God: for the true Jehovah says, To
whom will ye liken me? But now the stock by man's institution took on it,
without a warrant from God, to represent God. Now if God had warranted the
stock to be an image representing God, as he warranteth the Temple, the Ark,
Bread and Wine, to be images and representations of the true God Jesus Christ,
the stock should be a Doctrine of truth, and not of lies; so Surplice is a
Doctrine of lies, not because what it teaches is a lie, for what it teaches
is Scripture, Isa. 52. 11. That these who bears the Vessels of the Lord,
(that is Pastors) should be holy: but it is a Doctrine of lies, because it
represents Pastoral holiness by humane institution, without all warrant of
the Word of God. And when Paul calls holidayes Elements, Gal. 4. 6. He
means that they spell to us, and teach us some truth, as Estius, 1, 3. did.
37. S. 14.
Estius says, That holidayes do teach us Articles of Faith: To which meaning,
Palud. m. 3. d. 9. q. 1. art. 2.
Paludanus, Cajet. in 3. q. 25. art. 3.
Cajetan, Vasquez to. 3. de Ado. disp. 103. c. 4.
Vasquez say, God may well be painted in such expressions, as Scripture puts
on God, as in the likeness of a Dove, as a man with hands, eyes, ears, feet,
all which are given to God in Scripture. 4. It is essential to the Word to set
down the means of Gods worship, which is the very scope of the second
Commandment; and therefore the Jews washings and Traditions are condemned,
because they be Doctrines of men, appointed by men to be means of the fear or
worship of God, as Math. 15. 9. Mar. 7. 8. Isa. 29. 13. Hence we owe subjection
of Conscience to Ceremonies, as to lawful means of Worship. 1. Stirring up our
dull senses: And 2. as lawful signs representing in a Sacramental
signification, holy things: 3. As teaching signs: 4. As means of Gods fear and
worship: Whereas God (as Ainsworth, commu. of Saints.
Ainsworth observes well) in the second Commandment forbids all images and
representations: 2. All shapes, Exodus 20. 4. Temniah. 3. Forms of figures,
Tabuith, Deuteronomy. 4. 16. 5. Any type of shadow, Tselem, Ezekiel. 7. 20. 16, 17. 6.
Any pictured shape, Maskith, Levit. 26. 1. Any Statue, Monument, Pillar,
Mattesebah, any Graven, or Molten Portraict, Hos. 13. 2.

5. We are obliged to obey the Word, Exodus 20. 7. Prove. 3. 20, 21. Prove. 8. 13.
Ier. 6. 16. Ier. 5. 7. 2. We owe to the Word belief, Luke 1. 20. Love, Psalm.
119. 49. 81. Hope: 3. And are to expect a reward therefore, Psalm. 19. 11. Rev.
2. 7. 10. 27, 28. Gal. 4. 11. Romans 6. 23. Coloss. 2. 18. Hebrew. 11. 25. Psalm.
34. 9. Psalm 58. 11. Then if Decency be commanded, and order, in the third
Commandment, Ergo, this, and that orderly mean of Worship, as Surplice; But can
we say, I hope in the Surplice? O how love I crossing and Capping? can we
believe in Ceremonies, as means of Gods worship? 6. The word is Gods mean to
work supernatural effects, to convert the soul, Psalm. 19. 7. To work Faith,
John 20. 3. To edify, Act. 20. 32. To save, Romans 1. 16. The obedience to Gods
word, brings Peace, Psalm. 119. 165. Comfort, v. 50. Genesis 49. 18. Isa. 38. 3.
But Ceremonies, being apt to stir up the dull mind, must be apt to remove
Natural dullness, which is a supernatural effect, and so to bring, Peace,
joy, comfort: Organs are now holden by the same right, that they were in
Moses-Law, then they must stir up supernatural joy: There must be peace and
comfort in practicing them: Hear how this sounds, This is my comfort, O Lord,
in my affliction, that thy Surplice, Organs, and holy days have quickened my
dull heart. Now what comfort, except comfort in the Scriptures? Romans 15. 4.
Ceremonies be innocent of all Scriptures.

What joy (a proper fruit of the Kingdom of heaven, Romans 14. 17.) can be in
saplesse Ceremonies? yea, observe, 1. Who truly converred from Popery, who
inwardly humbled in soul, does not abhor Ceremonies, by the instinct of the new
birth? 2. What slave of hell and profane person call not for Ceremonies? 3.
Who has peace in dying, that Ceremonies were their joy? 7. All Lawful
Ordinances may by prayer be recommended to God for a blessed success as all
the means of salvation, Psalm. 119. 18. Matthew. 26. 26. Act. 4. 29, 30. 2. We may
thank God for a blessed success, which they have by the working of the spirit
of Grace, 2 Cor. 2. 24. 1 Cor. 1. 4, 5. 2 These. 1. 2, 3. Ephesians. 1. 3. 3. We are
to have heat of zeal against profaning of word, Sacraments, Prayer, or other
Ordinances of God: But what faith in praying, Lord work with Crossing, Capping,
Surplice? For where the word is not, nor any promise, there be no Faith, Romans
10. 14. What praising can there be for Ceremonies working upon the soul? What
zeal (except void of knowledge and light of the word, and so but wilde-fire?
Gal. 4. 17, 18. Phil. 3. 6. 2 Samuel 21. 2.) can there be, though the Surplice be
employed to cleanse Cups, and Crossing be scorned? If the subject be nothing,
the accidents be less; if Surplice be not commanded, nor forbidden, the
reverent or irreverent usage thereof, cannot be forbidden, nor commanded, true
zeal is incensed only at sin, and kindled toward Gods warranted service. 8. I
take it to be Gods appointment, that the Spirit works by a supernatural
operation, with his own Ordinances, in the regenerated, but we desire to know
how the Spirit works with Ceremonies: Formalists are forced by these grounds
to maintain the Lawfulness of Images: So 1. They be not adored: 2. If they be
reputed as indifferent memorative Objects, and books to help the memory. But 1.
It shall be proved that at first, Papists did give no adoration to Images, nor
does Durandus, Hulcot, Pic. Mirandula acknowledge any adoration due to them,
but proper to God* before the Images as objects. 2. We may liken God and Christ
to a stock, so we count it indifferent, to make, or not to make such an image,
yet likening him to any thing is forbidden, Isa 40. 18. Also we esteem it
Idolatry interpretative, to take Gods place in his word, and to make any thing
to be a mean of grace, except Gods own Ordinances: Against all these Formalists
have diverse exceptions.

As 1. Our Ceremonies (say they) do not respect the honor of God immediately,
and in themselves, but by accident, and as parts of Divine worship by
reduction, as it contains all the adjuncts of worship.

Ans. Such Logic was never heard of: 1. If he mean a Surplice in the
materials, to wit, Linen and Crossing Physically considered, as separated from
their signification, do not tend immediately to the honor of God, but as an
adjunct, he speaks nonsense, for so Bread, Wine, eating, drinking, Water in
Baptism do not immediately respect the honor of God, but only as they have a
Moral consideration and stand under Divine institution. But yet so the
material of worship is not the adjunct thereof, but the matter, as the body of
a living man is not one adjunct of a man. If he mean, that Ceremonies in a
Moral (not in a Physical) consideration do not immediately respect the honor
of God, but reductively, and by accident. Let him show us, if the Surplice does
not as immediately, and without the intervening mediation of any other thing,
signify and stir up our minds to the remembrance of Pastoral holiness, as
eating all of one bread, does immediately stir up our minds to the remembrance
of our Communion of love, that we be all one body in Christ, 1 Cor. 10. 16. 2.
If he mean Ceremonies as such special materials, to wit, Surplice, etc. as
ordained of man, who may ordain another Ceremony, does not immediately respect
the honor of God. 1. This is to beg the question: 2. A white garment upon a
priest of Jupiter Sacrificing to that Idol should immediately respect the
honor of Jupiter, though the Priest might honor Jupiter with garments of
white Roses, or some other like device, while he officiateth. So bowing of the
knee in prayer does immediately honor God, though I may pray sitting or
standing. 3. It is a dream that the honor of the subject is given to the
adjunct, yea, and properly is the adjunct, and agrees to the adjunct, as
Surplice has the very Office and place of Gods word and Sacrament^, to teach
and signify, and yet they are but adjuncts, if a man's Coat, or his Hat, or
Shoes could discourse and reason, as only the man can do, in reason we should
say the Coat is the man.

2. They say, God forbids efficient and operative means of worship, and
grace in the second Commandment, or means immediate which works by virtue in
themselves, or wrapped in them, for so the word and Sacraments are means of
grace and worship; yea, the Sacraments be exhibitive seals, and therefore we
owe to such means subjection of conscience immediately, both to the things
instituted, and particular means of admonition, and to the duties admonished or
called to our remembrance by them, for they have virtue residing, and inherent
in them, by divine institution to work upon us. But God forbids not, in the
second Commandment, means that teach occasionally, as Objectum a quo, therefore
we owe subjection of conscience to the things admonished, but not to the
particular means of admonition, therefore we are tied in conscience to
Ceremonies only collaterally and propter aliud, they be only external objects
or occasions. For whoever (says he) expected that men should be stirred up by
Ceremonies, as by causes, or any otherwise, but as by sensible objects, as we
are by the sight of the creatures, or other memorials? therefore (says he)
they are not means, by the which grace is wrought by the power of God wrapped
in them, but resident in God himself, that freely gives the grace, by the
right use of them: so D. Burges. Burges Rejoinder c. 3. Sect. 9. p. 279. And in
a Treatise of kneeling, c. 18. q. 4. p. 57.


Ans. All comes to this, Ceremonies takes the place of Word and Sacraments,
but cannot fill the chair, and discharge the office so well as Gods Ordinances
does: A Clown takes on the Crown, and usurpeth the Throne, and cannot do
Regal Acts, with such grace of Royal Majesty, as the Lawful King, what, is
he for that no usurping Traitor? 2. He will not have Ceremonies to be causes of
worship, but occasions so do Papists say: Images (says Vasquez 3. p. To. 1. de
ador. 103. c. 4. Cum nos eas form as quibus Deus apparuit d^pingimus, nolumus
aliud quam bistoriam illam, and effectum ob oculos pon^re.
Vasquez) do only set before us the History and effects of God. Bellarmine,
Suarez (as all know) do say, That Images cannot so represent Jehovah; as he is
in himself, or described in his word, nor can the Idol or Image of* God
represent God, as a cause, but only as an object external and occasion, and
yet God forbids it, Isa. 40. 18. Hab. 2. 19. 20. 2. Gods word to the
reprobate is a sealed Book, and is, as if you would teach letters, to a new
weaned child, Isa. 29. 11. c. 29. 9. It works by no inherent virtue wrapped
in it self, but though it be mighty, yet is it mighty through God, 2 Cor. 10.
4. Ioshuahs twelve stones, the Phylacteries, the Manna, the Rainbow, did only,
(as Aquin. 12. q. 102. art. 6. ad. 7. Et idco per aspectum hujus signi
induccbantur in memoriam suae legis.
Aquinas says well) work upon the senses and memory. The word it self does
but work morally or objectively, and is not a cause having the power of God
wrapped in it. If Surplice work only as an occasion, the Preachers, Napkin, the
bands of women does so excite the memory and the affection: 3. All our Divines
teach, that the Sacraments are exhibitive seals, but not of themselves, or by
any virtue inherent in them (as Papists say) but by the power of God, which
works by the right receiving of the Sacraments, and the Sacraments Actu Primo
and essentially are only signs, which works objectively and occasionally, as
you say your unhallowed Ceremonies do: 1. because they are Sacraments
essentially, whether they be received by Faith, or not, and they are exhibitive
seals only to believers. 2. Unbelievers should not profane the Sacraments by
their unworthy receiving of them, if they were not Sacraments to them only
signifying, and if they were exhibiting seals to them, then should they receive
them worthily, which is against what we suppose: 3. The Fathers, as Just.
Martyr Dialog. cum Tryph. ante medium.
Justine Martyr Irenaeus l. 4. c. 30.
Ireneus Epiphanius here is.
Epiphanius Chrysostom. hom. 27. in Genesis
Chrysostom Ambros lib. 1. de Abraham cap. 4.
Ambrose prove, that Circumcision, in its nature, except to believers, did only
signify Grace.

5. Here be a most vilde distinction, That we owe subjection of conscience to
the thing admonished, but not to Surplice, or to such means and particular
admonishers, but only collaterally: But ^. is the Church ordaining Ceremonies a
collateral Mistress over the conscience, and who is the other collateral
judge here? who but Christ? 2. We owe this collateral subjection of Conscience
to the Image of We owe subjection of Conscience, collateral only to the word.
the Trinity: for though we owe not subjection of Conscience to the image, as
such an admonisher, or such an exhorting object; seeing the Word of God may
also admonish us of God, yet we owe subjection of conscience to the thing
admonished, to wit, to the blessed trinity. 3. Neither owe we subjection of
conscience to the word, as written with ink on paper, nor to the sound of the
word Preached; yea, nor do we owe subjection of Faith to the Word as the Word;
but only collateral: when we say, ( I hope in the Word, (I believe the Word,)
I rejoice in the Word of God) we take the Word, for Objetum quo, and God for
Objectum quod, for the word is not the formal object of any subjection of
Conscience; I owe to the Word, not a subjection of Conscience collateral or
coequall with the subjection that I owe to* God, but only subordinate as to a
mean, and to the Word for God, and because it is instituted by God; but I owe
subjection of Conscience to God solely, independently, and only; yea,
subjection of Conscience is not due to the Word for its manner of working, and
not due to the Ceremonies; because they work not as the Word of God does (as no
wonder, they being but hay and stubble) but subjection of Conscience is due to
the Word, because God is the Author of it, and speaks in it himself, as is
clear, Ier. 13. 15. Amos 3. 8. Heb. 2. 3. Hear, for the Lord has spoken, and
it is to be received only, and in Conscience yielded unto, as it is the Word of
God, Isa. 1. 2. 1 Thessalonians. 2. 13. Now because we cannot receive the Surplice,
Crossing, Capping, as the Surplice of God, and as the Crossing of Christ;
therefore are we not to submit at all to the Doctrines which these unlawful
teaching means does bring to our memory, because they have no warrant of
Christ, to speak or spell us the very language and mind of God, which God has
spoken in his word by his holy Prophets and Apostles: Yea, though crosses and
afflictions work only upon us, as occasions, and external objects; yet are we
to submit our Conscience to them, as to warnings, because they be sent as Gods
Messengers appointed by him, as Mic. 6. 9. Hear the Rod, and who has appointed
it. 4. Ceremonies (...)
work (says Burges) as sensible objects, and as other Creatures; yea, but he

of God, and that which may be known of God, is made manifest in them: and God
has manifested ((...)) these things by the Creatures, Romans 1. 19. But
Ceremonies are not books of Gods writing, God has not written nor booked this
upon a Surplice ( Be holy, ye who bear the Vessels of the Lord) he has written
it in Isaiahs book, c. 52. 11. And we submit to the teaching of the Creatures,
though they work not upon the soul, as the Word and Sacraments do, because God
has appointed such books to teach us; Erg^, we are in no sort to submit to the
Devils books, Printed by Prelates, or to their Ceremonial Volumnes, because God
has written nothing upon them; and here by the way, I say it is unlawful,
yea* and Hypocrisy to be devouter then God will have us, as to enlarge the
Phylacteries, and make them above Gods measure, Numb. 15. 38. To be humble by a
mean not appointed of God, Ioh. 13. Or to do what God only should do, as to
make Anointing Oil besides Gods Oil, Exodus 30. 31, 32, 33. Or to set a
threshold and a post, beside Gods own threshold, Ezekiel. 43. 8. is presumption.

Lastly, Gods spirit works not with Ceremonies, and so they The spirit
works not with Ceremonies.
are as the offering of Swines blood, and the slaying of a man; and so
Abomination to God, Isa. 66. 1, 2. The holy spirit is merited to us by Christ,
Ioh. 16. 14. He shall receive of mine, and show unto you: But who can say that
the grace of joy in the holy Ghost, wrought by the droning of Organs, and the
holiness taught by Surplice, is a work of the spirit merited by Christ as our
High Priest? 3. God has made no promise that he will work by Ceremonies, for
the spirit works not without the Word; so then I might resist the working of
the spirit, and not sin against the Word; and this is Anabaptists Enthusiasme:
If God work not by them, they be vain and fruitless; and the Idol is unlawful
for this, that it profits not. Also, the spirits action is either natural or
supernatural here: If natural, it is a natural work, and a natural spirit,
and to be rejected: If supernatural, we may devise means to produce
supernatural effects, men's Ceremonies can produce supernatural joy, comfort,
peace, and acts of grace purchased to us by Christ's merit; this is a miracle.

3. They say, All this may be said against your Circumstances of time and
place, for they are appropriated to Religious uses, and not for that made holy
parts of Divine Worship. 2. Time and place, are new things as our Ceremonies
are. 3. Spiritual signification makes Ceremonies so much the better, but
hinders them not, but that they Burges, rejoinder, c. 1. S. 15. p. 57, 58.
may be Rites of mere Order: Burges.

Ans. Time, Place, Pulpit, Table-cloath, are new, Physically, often, not new
Morally, or Religiously, they have no Spiritual influence in worship. A civil
declamation has the same time, place, (b) Ammes, his fresh suit against
Ceremonies, ib.
pulpit with a Preaching; for then, if for application, you call them
Religious, as D. Ammes says well, An hill whereon a Preacher Preaches, a
Judge persuades a Law, a Captain speaks to his Soldiers, is both a Sacred,
a judicial, a Military hill, 2. Signification spiritual, makes Ceremonies
capable of being ordered: for Surplice wearing, and Crossing, being Doctrinall,
as teaching signifying, stirring up the dull affections, as does the Word and
Sacrament, they require order and decency: Now things of mere order, requires
no ordering, as time and place require not other time and place to circumstance
them right. 2. This is that which Papists say (as Suarez, tom. de legib. lib.
4. cap. 1. n. 10. Praecepta Ecclesiastica feruntur quatenus convenienti^ sunt
ad bonos mores, ut res sacrae cum debito honor fiant; consequenter vero
interdum habent significationem moralem, quae homines excitat ad virtutem and
spem gloriae.
Suarez) that by consequent only, they have signification putupon them.

Now fourthly, The place, Matthew. 15. where Christ reproves The place, Matthew.
15. touching Traditions of the Elders discussed.
the Traditions of Pharisees, as Doctrines of men. The Jesuit Vasquez his
Answer is their Answer: Vasquez, Tom. 2. in 12. disp. 152. cap. 4. That Christ
reproves them not because they kept the Traditions of the Elders; Sed quod in
falsis praeceptis Divinae legi contrari isputarent esse summam Religionis:
Because they believed all Religion to stand in their Traditions, which were
contrary to Gods Law, and for their own, omitted Gods Commandments. And Suarez,
Tom. de legib. lib 4. cap. 2. He reproves what they added, Tanquam nova, as
new things: Corduba, Ad. victor. rel. 1. de potestate Ecclesiae, q. 3. Prop. 6.
But Chrysostom, Hom. 32. in Matthew. Thinks better that they had no power to
make Laws; yea, Janse^ius, Concord. Evange. p. 120. Becanus the Jesuit, in
opusc. to. 2. de. Analog. vet. et New Test. cap. 1. q. 7. n. 13, 14, 15.
reckons out three causes, why Christ reproved all the Traditions of the
Pharisees* 1. Because they sought vain glory in some of them, Matthew. 23. v. 5.
2. They sought gain of others of their Traditions, Matthew. 23. 14. ^3. They
preferred some of them to weightier matters of Gods Law. Ans. None of these
touches the point in this text, because the Tradition of washing hands, is
reproved by Christ for want of a lawful Author, and so the matter of it also
was unlawful; for Christ calls it a Doctrine of men.
he condemns the Laws written in their forehead.

But this exposition is false: 1. They brought in Traditions at first for vain
glory, to be called Rabbi, Matthew. 23. 7, 8. Ergo, they thought them not at
first of Religious necessity: 2. Mark says, cap. 7. 5. Why walk not thy
Disciples according to the Traditions of the Elders? Therefore the external
practice, and not the internal opinion of necessity and holiness is
condemned, as is clear. And when the Pharisees saw some of the Disciples eat
bread with unwashen hands, they found fault. The challenge was for an external
omission of an outward observance, which may be seen with the eyes; Ergo, these
Traditions are not condemned by Christ, because they were contrary to Gods
Word, or impious; but in this, that they were contrary, because not Commanded;
for in the external Religious act of washing hands, there was no other impiety
of a wicked opinion objected to Christ's Disciples: for if the Pharisees eye had
been satisfied in that the Disciples should wash before they eat, they would
not have contended with Christ's Disciples, about the Piety of these Traditions,
nor about any inward opinion, that they added under this Reduplication as new,
as Suarez says: But the Church which cannot err, including the Jewish Pope,
the High Priest, can add nothing as new contrary to Gods Law; nor is there any
question betwixt the Pharisees and the Lords Disciples: Whether the Traditions
of the Elders, should be esteemed the marrow and sum of all Religion, as
Vasquez says; But only anent external conformity with walking in the
Traditions of the Elders, or not walking, as is most clear in the Text: It is
true, Christ objected they accounted more of men's Traditions, nor of Gods
Commandments, as Papists and Formalists do: But that was not the state of the
question betwixt the Disciples of Christ and the Pharisees. 2. Christ rejects
these Traditions, by an Argument taken from the want of a lawful Author, while
he calls them Precepts of men, opposed to the Commandments of God, and while
he says v. 13. That every plant not rooted by his heavenly Father, shall be
rooted out; Yea, and Christ expressly proves their worship vain, because they
taught the fear and worship of God, by the precepts of men, and not by the word
of God; and Ceremonies are the precepts of men. 3. Mar. 7. 10, 11, 12. He
alleges their corrupt and false exposition of the fifth Commandment, in
saying, It is a gift whereby Parents may benefit, which Children offer to God,
though they help not their Parents in their poverty; and necessity, and so you
free them from obedience to the fifth Commandment of God, by setting up your
false gloss (says Christ) which is a human tradition. Then to Christ this is
a good argument, your corrupting of the fifth Commandment with your false
glosses is a rejecting of Gods 5. Commandment; why? because it is a doctrine of
men, and one of the Pharisees Traditions: For whether they placed operative
sanctity in preferring men's Commandment to Gods or not; none can deny but
Christ reasons against these evils, because they were men's Traditions,
otherway Formalists shall be forced to say, that if the Pharisees have esteemed
them Arbitrary, and of no operative sanctity, men's Commandments had not been
vain worship; Christ's Argument from Isa. 29. should prove nothing, for false
glosses and corrupting the fifth Commandment is not vain worship, because it is
a doctrine of men; for Doctrines of men as only coming from men, and esteemed
Arbitrary, are not vain, says Formalists; yea, except they be contrary in the
matter to Gods Law, and proffered or equalized in the opinion of sanctity to
Gods Law, they are not a whit vain, because they come from men, or are
doctrines of men. 4. Christ defends his Disciples practice in abstaining from
external not-washing; Ergo, he esteemed the external washing unlawful: But
if the Disciples abstinence was because of the impiety of washing, and the
opinion of sanctity put upon washing, otherwise Lawful; he should have
defended his Disciples in a thing unlawful; for to disobey the Elders and
Church-guides, who sat in Moses's chair, and were to he obeyed, Matthew. 23. 2,
3. in an external indifferent act of washing not contrary to the washings
commanded in Moses Law, and so negatively conform to Gods Law, is Lawful, as
Formalists and Papists both teach; but Christ defended his Disciples in their
non-obedience external, for they were not challenged, for denying the opinion
of operative holiness to these Ceremonies: Christ who commanded obedience to
sitters in Moses his chair in all things Lawful, would have obeyed himself,
and cleared his Disciples in so far, as they ought to obey, or not to obey. 5.
Vasquez says, These Traditions were unlawful, because they were invented,
Sola voluntate hominum absque ratione, by the sole will of men without reason.
But so are Popish Ceremonies, for if they can be proved by the word of God, and
the light of nature, they are essential parts of Gods word, and not
accidental, nor left to the Churches will. 2. It is good then the Jesuit
confesses the Church from sole will, and so the Pope and Prelat can make no
Laws, but either Scripture or natures light must warrant them, and sole will
cannot rule them: 3. They had as good reason in general from Moses his
writings, and the Law-washings, as Pope and Prelates have for their Traditions.
But says Vasquez, Christ complains of these traditions, because they held
them to be, Summam Religionis, the marrow of Religion, and took no care of Gods
Law. Ans. That will no more prove them to be vain worship, and that the
Disciples were to be justified in their nonconformity to these Church
washings, then that Gods Disciples, and sound believers under the Old Testament
should abstain from keeping Gods Sabbaths, his New Mons, and from offering
Sacrifices, because the people placed all holiness in these of old, and
neglected works of mercy and justice, Isa. 1. 11, etc. Jer. 7. 4, 5, 6. But
(say Formalists) Christ condemns them because the Pharisees thought, eating
with unwashen hands defiled the conscience, and meat defiled the soul, when the
eaters did not wash as the elders commanded: Whereas Christ says, It is not
that which goes in at the mouth, which defiles the man, but the wickedness
that comes out at the heart. Ans. It is true, and I think Pharisees believed
meat eaten contrary to the Elders Traditions, defiled the conscience, as is
clear, Mat. 15. 16, 17, 18. And that also Christ condemns, as a Doctrine of
men, and of ignorant men, and so does nonconformity to your Ceremonies pollute
the conscience as a breach of the fifth, and second Command as you say.

QUEST. IV.
Whether humane Ceremonies can consist with Order, Decency, and the sincerity
of our profession of true Religion?

CEremonies fight with Order and Decency. 1. These Rites pretended IV. Arg.
by Gods command, to add order and decency to Gods worship, and yet deface his
worship, and adds none thereunto be unlawful: But humane Ceremonies be such;
Ergo, That they pretend Order is proved. D. Burges says, They have no place in
all the New Testament, save only, 1 Cor. 14. 26. Let all things be done in
order, and decency, a place as ( a) Estius cites, Magnified by Papists, Estius
l. 3. ^. 37. p. 139
for all their Ceremonies: The Major is undeniable, I prove the Assumption: 1.
Because Magick-like Rites honored with Gods name as Christian-Masse,
Christs-Masse, an Adored Tree called Gods board, when there is no use for a
Table, a Crossing honored with dedication to Christ's service, is like Gods
name used by sorcerers in Charming, Spelling, Divining, where virtue is
ascribed to signs, characters and words, which have no such virtue from God or
nature, and this Valentia justly calls Superstition. Gregor* de valent, to.
3. dis 6. q 13. pun. 1. S^ effectus intentus superet vimmedii, erit
superstitio. Ceremonies Magical*
So the Jews called the Calfe Jehovah, Papists call a creature of their making,
Agnus Dei, a style due to Christ only, Joh. 1. 29. 2. All creatures are means
of glorifying God, Rev. 4. 11. Prove. 16. 4. Romans 11. 36. And may be invited to
praise God, as Psalm. 148. Now it were strange bleating, to say, O Crossing,
Surplice, Praise ye the Lord, when things ordained by man's sole will, and so
idle and sinful, are made means to glorify God; with as good reason dancing
in the Church, and blowing feathers in the Air, which have by nature or
reason, no aptitude for these ends, may be decent means of glorifying God. 2.
Order and decency supernatural in the Church is in the Word, Cant. 6. 4. Clear
as the Sun, terrible as an Army with Banners: Nothing wanting Gods institution
can reach a supernatural end, as our Ceremonies are: 2. But also Ceremonies
relatively sacred in Religious state must be more then civilly decent, as also
If the third Comma^dment, command Decency in its generality, as they say, then
it must command decency in this, or this Rite, as in Surplice, Crossing, etc.
right order produces supernatural joy, Gal. 2. 5. Civil order cannot do
this: Or 3. Ceremonies add natural order, but this is not in color,
Religions color is supernaturally white, ingenuous, not whorish: 2. Or then it
adds order of parts, and this is by right, grave, and convenient
circumstantiating of things in Gods worship, and Paul dreamed never of Crossing
to grace baptizing: 3. Or it adds due quantity, Religious worship has no
quantity but time. 4. It is against sense, that order is commanded in the third
Commandment, but not Surplice, Crossing, because they are by accident orderly;
what agrees essentially to the general, agrees not essentially and
necessarily to the speces and particulars which are by accident under that
general, as what agrees to a man, agrees not to white and black men. Decency
is commanded, but by accident, and by man's will Surplice is decent. But then
God commanding Sacraments, should not command Bread and Wine, sor they are by
accident, and by Gods will Sacraments, he might have chosen other Elements, yet
the will of God commanding Sacraments, commands this and this Sacrament also:
What agrees essentially to man, agrees essentially to all men black and
white. If Gods will essentially concur to constitute decency in his own
worship, then must that same will essentially concur to constitute this
decency, in Surplice, Crossing. 2. It supposes a great untruth, that Crossing
is not worship, because not ordained of God, but that proves it is not Lawful
worship, but not, that it is non-worship, for Crossing used to the honor of
Baal, and to edify souls in performing their duty to Baal, is essentially a
worshipping of Baal, otherwise worshipping of Idols is not Worship, and yet it
is an Act of Religious honoring of the Idol. 3. The Command that commands,
or forbids the end, commands and forbids the means ( Thou shall not
murder) forbids the Master, not to command his servant to ride an extremely
deep and impetuous River, though the not riding of such a River be not set down
in the word, and it is not forbidden as an Arbitrary action: If therefore
decency bind the conscience, then the decency of this Rite, to wit, Crossing
binds the conscience; Our Ceremonies are not National; for Crossing being a
Religious Rite, in all the world its alike decent; Ergo, non* Crossing in some
Country cannot be undecent; Things merely Religious, as all significant
Ceremonies are of alike nature every where, and admit not of heat and cold with
diverse climates, are of good or evil manners, with diverse Nations, therefore
they must be determined in the word; the man who Pre^aced on our Service book
said, without some Ceremonies it is impossible to keep any order, or quiet
Discipline in the Church. I am sure he must think that Paul preached in some
Surplice that he might teach holiness with his garments one way or other, he
has a stronger Faith then I can reach; without circumstances worship cannot
be, but without Romish dirt, the Worship and Discipline are better kept* then
with such whorish busking.

Also whatever is a profession in fact, of a false Religion by V. Arg. Jewish
and Popish Ceremonies are professions of a false Religion.
Ceremonies indifferent, and yet proper to a false Religion, is a denying of
the true Religion, but the using of these Ceremonies, used by Papists and Jews
is such; Ergo, The Proposition is Scripture, Gal. 2. 14. Peter lived after the
manner of the Jews, in using the Religious materials of the Jews, though he had
no Jewish intention or opinion; yea, Acts 10. he disputes against that: So
Circumcision, Galathians 6. 14, 15* is put for the Jewish Church. Now Altars,
Organs, Jewish Ephods, or Surplice, Mass* clothes, and Romish Crossing, bowing
to Altars, Images, are badges of Jewish and Popish Religion: We know the
dispute betwixt Augustine and Jerome, who defended Peter's d^ssimulation, Gal.
2. to gain the Jews: But Augustine says, Epist. 9. Si propterea illa
Sacramenta celebravit (Paulus) quia simularet se judaeum, ut illos
lucrifaceret, cur non etiam Sacrificavit cum Gentibus, quia and iis, qui sine
lege erant, tanquam sine lege factus est, ut eos quoque lucrifaceret* Yea, then
(as Augustine says to Jerome, Epist* ad Hyeronym, 19.) We might use all the
Jewish Ceremonies to gain the Jews, and so fall in the Herersie of Ebion and
the Nazarites. Duvallius, 2. Thom tract. de legib. q. 3. Art. 3. would defend
Peter in that; but he says, Magis placet Barronii Responsio. Tom. 1. Annal.
an. 51. Petrum venialiter peccasse: As for Paul's Circumcising of Timothy,
Papists clear him. Vasquez, Tom. 1. in 12. disp. 181. cap. 8. Lo^o and tempore
accomodato, He did it when he could not offend the Gentiles: Aquinas, 12. q.
103. Art. 4. Yea, so the Fathers, as Augustine, Epist. 19. Chrysostom, Cyrill,
Hyeronym.

Also Papists, Bensonius, tractat* de fuga, lib. 1. disp. 1. q. 4. ad Articul.
4. Vasquez, Tom* 1. 12. disp. 182. cap. 4. Brove to use Jewish Ceremonies,
though with no Jewish mind is unlawful: Suarez Tom. de legib. lib. 9. de leg.
Divin. pos. cap. 14. Vsus Circumcisionis ex prohibitione est factus malus, and
actus malus non honestatur propter intentionem bonam. Aquinas 22. q. 11. c^ 12.
q. 103. Art. 4. As one should mortally sin, who should say, Christum nunc
nas^iturum, Christ is yet to be incarnat, So the using of the Jewish Ceremonies
were a lie in fact. Cajetan, and Toletus, acknowledge a lie in fact. Salmeron,
in Gal. 5. q. 2. says, It is unlawful to use the Jewish Ceremonies. Aegidius
Comic* de actib. supernatural. lib. 2. disp. 15. dub. 3. ^. 39. Nullo modo
licet obullum* finem, uti Ceremoniis propriis falsae Religionis. Vasquez, 12.
disp. 182. ^. 48. Patres and Doctores communiter tenent non licere: Lodo.
Meratius Iesuita, to. 1. in Thom. tract. de legib. disp. 19. Sect. 2. n. 5.
Mentiti fuissent Apostoli usurpantes exteriores legis Mosaicae Ceremonias si

7. punct. 7. q. 7. Soto de justif. l. 2. q. 5.

It is a Religious scandal to the users of these Ceremonies: for Arg. 6.
Ceremonies devised by men, of no necessary use in Gods worship, are monuments
of Idolatry, snares drawing the practisers to Idolatry, and so unlawful, as
the High places, Groves, Images, though not Adored of the Canaanites. This
Argument is so learnedly D. Ammes fresh suit.
prosecuted by D. Ammes, that I add nothing to it.

QUEST. V.
Whether the Ceremonies, especially kneeling in the act of receiving the
Sacrament, be guilty of idolatry?

Whoever presumes to invent a worship of his own, commits Arg. 7.
Idolatry interpretatively, because he worshippeth a God whom he conceives is
pleased with false worship: But that is not the true God, for he is pleased
with no worship, but what he has prescribed himself; but all inventers and
practisers of humane Ceremonies, worship such a God: Also, all who usurpeth Of
Religious kneeling.
the room and place of God, give the glory of God to creatures; but all Authors
and practisers of humane Ceremonies, take the room and place of God, from God,
and give it to creatures, because to ordain worship; and all Religious means of
worship, is proper to the only wise Lawgiver: But for the clearing of this
Question, I divide it in some subordinate Questions.

SECT. I.
Whether Religious kneeling, laying aside our intention and will to Adore that
before which we kneel, of its own nature be Adoration?

This Question is most necessary, both against Papists and Formalists: But
first remember, that Rathael de la Torres, or* din. praedicat. tom. 1. in 22.
Tho. q. 84. tra. 2. disp. 5.
Raphael de la Torres, a late Schoolman, makes seven Adorations: 1. Bowing of
the knee. 2. Prostration. 3. The lifting up of the eyes. 4. Of the hands to
Heaven. 5. Kissing. 6. Knocking on the Breast. 7. Uncovering of the head:
Though this last be not Adoration, but a National sign of Reverence, and is
not every where Adoration; yet Abulensis in Levit. cap. 13. q. 10.
Abulensis says, the Jews did pray and Sacrifice with covered heads: So says
Virgil. An. 3. Et capiteante aras phrygio velatus amictu.
Virgill, and Lod. vives com. in August. de civit. dei lib. 15. c. 2.
Lod. Vives: Therefore the Corinthians had this from the Grecians as a civil
sign of gravity, which should not be banished from Gods worship; and if it be
appropriate to an Idol, it should in that case be made Veneration: But no
Reverence at all is due to an Idol. Jesuits, as Suarez. Tom. 1. in 3. Thom. q.
25 art. 5. Sect. 4.
Suarez* and others, and Formalists, Morton, Burges, Hooker teach us, That
Religious bowing before a creature, if there be no intention of Adoring, is not
Adoration: But it is to be considered;

1. Bowing of the knee Physically or civilly* is indifferent and is not
Adoration: for we bow to Kings, and Artificers may bow the knee to drive a nail
in a bed, and yet are not Adoring; but Religious Adoration, whither ye will or
not by natures impression is a Religious note of Religious submission.

2. I consider four acts of the soul that may convoy external Adoration. Four
things in Adoration.
1. One of the mind, a consideration of the excellency of what we Adore: 2. A
will to submit to this excellency: 3. The judgments diting this to be honest
to submit: 4. A purpose or intention habitual or actual of Adoring; many of
these may be where there is no Adoring: and the Religious external bowing of
the body is essentially Adoring, when that bowing is in a state of worship:
kneeling before consecrated Elements for Reverence of either God or the
Elements, must be Adoration, though we should wash it with foul water, and say,
that there is no intention to tender Gods glory to these Elements.

3. Let it be considered what is said by the Joannes de Lugo, de myster.
incarna^, dis. 23. Sect. 2. n. 23.
Jesuit Joannes de Lugo, the Popes Professor at Rome, which I propound with
some change: 1. There is a purpose of external Adoring, with an inward
submission of the heart; whether this be an habitual or actual intention, it*
is sure it is an Adoration, when it comes forth in a gesture of Adoring. 2. A
will to bow the body in scorn and derision, as the Soldiers bowed the knee
before Jesus; and this being not in a state of worshipping, but in a state and
^ase of disgracing, is not Religious bowing or Adoration: This is not a
natural expression of inward submission, but rather of disgrace. 3. There is a
willed or voluntary Religious bowing for fear, for gain, or for glory; yet
without any internal estimation of the excellency of the thing Adored. This
Suarez denies to be worshipping, it being only a faining of worship, not a
worshipping. Intention of worship not essential to worship.


But I prove the contrary: 1. Because then no enacted worshipping of Idols,
were indeed a worshipping of an Idol, and yet all the time that the Adorer
boweth his knee to the Idol, though he have no inward purpose of heart to Adore
the external bowing, must be a natural expression of actual submission to
the thing before which we bow, and a conciliating of an opinion with others, of
Religious eminency and subjection of Divine dignity, to that thing before which
we kneel. 2. Religious kissing of the Calves of Samaria, Hos. 8. is a natural
expression of Religious love to these Calves, though the kisser have no
intention of worshipping* 3. Act. 14. 11, 12, 13. The men of Lystra are
reproved for Sacrificing, and so for Adoring-men; 15. Sirs, Why do ye these
things for we also, are men of like passions as you, and Preach to you that ye
should turn from these Vanities to the living God? Barnabas and Paul rebukes
the men of Lystra, because they worshipped men with humane passions; yet did
they not intend to worship men, for they were to them in that act of
worshipping, Gods in men's shape, as they say, v. 11. Gods are come down to us
in the likeness of men; if they conceived them not to be men indeed, but Gods
come down from heaven; then could they not intend to worship men, but Gods: So
John would not, nor had any purpose to worship a created Angel; but taking him
to be God, he fell down and worshipped, as is clear by the Angels reproof,
Rev. 19. 10. He said unto me, See thou do it not, I am thy fellow servant:
Likewise, Act. 17. The Athenians set up an Altar not to the Pourtraict of gold,
which yet they worshipped, v. 2. 4, 5. but intended not to worship it; Also to
intend worship is essential to worship, as sincere and hearty; Ergo, ^^ is not
essential to worship in general, as what is essential to the spece as such,
is not essential to the general that com prehendeth that sp^ce.
But the God which made heaven and earth, whom Paul preached: So are the
Gentiles said to offer to Devils, not to God* what they offer, 1 Cor. 10. 20.
Deuteronomy. 37. 17. Psalm. 106. 37. and 2 Chronicles. 11. 15. Peroboams Calves are Devils;
and yet they intended not to worship Devils, but God, that brought them out of
the Land of Egypt, 1 King. 12. 28.

4. If Religious kneeling require that we intend to worship every thing, before
which; as an object, we do Religiously kneel; then Religious kneeling should
not signify in ernall submission of the heart by natures impression or Divine
institution; but by the voluntary and the free institution of him that
kneeleth: But this ^a^ter is absurd, for if kneeling should signify, what it
does signify by our free and voluntary appointment: Then we might 1. put upon
natural gestures what sig^ific^tion we pleased, and were not to stand to the
signification which God and nature have put upon kneeling. 2. So it were in
man's power to impose upon Religious kneeling to God, civil courtesy, such as a
subject expresses to his Prince, or a son to his Father, and it were free to
us to kneel to a stock, and that Religiously, and yet put upon kneeling the
negative reverence, that we give to the Bible; and it were in the three
childrens will to kneel to N^buchadnezzars Image, and impose this signification
on the g^sture, that they were kneeling to God only, all which are manifestly
false: so Field of the Church, 4. book cap. 31.
Field says, kneeling has institution from the instinct of nature.

They Object, 1. The external act of kneeling signifies the inward submission
of heart, but there is no inward submission of the heart to a thing to which we
kneel, when we are compelled to kneel only for fear of men, or induced to kneel
for hope of glory, or some byrespect without any intention or purpose to adore,
therefore this external Adoration is a false sign, and signifies not a thing
as it is, and so is no worship.

Ans. That external bowing is not true, but false: I distinguish, it is not
true Morally, because it is a false sign, and a sinful abusing of worship,
for there ought to be a bow^d heart, when there is a bowed knee, but if the
meaning be, this external bowing is not true metaphysically, and partaketh not
of the nature of Religious worshipping, it is false, for it is truly worship,
and the essence and definition of worship agrees to it: for from Religious
bowing there resulteth by the nature of the external Act, which is of divine
institution, an honoring of that before which we do bow, as before a proposed
object, what ever be the present purpose or intention of the bower: else if I
bow to an Idol intending, and conveying in my heart-purpose all honor to God
only, I should not worship an Idol: The three Children cast into the fiery
Furnace did but refuse external bowing to Nebuchadnezzar, and would hazard
upon burning quick, before they should give that to the Religious bowing of its
nature, not by man's free and Arbitrary intention signifies divine Adoration.
Image; for the Kings commandment was not, that all should give and convey in
purpose of heart to that Image all divine glory, but only Religious prostration
before it; yet the three Children say, Dan. 3. Well, be it known to thee, O
king, that we will not serve thy Gods, nor worship thy golden Image, (...) They
expressly refuse knee-bowing, and the reason is, because if ye bow your knee
Religiously to a stock, it is not in your power or free choice, to stay the
flux and motion of Religious honor off, or from the stock; but because
Religious bowing does not convey honor to the thing before which ye bow by
your free will, but by God and natures institution, even as weeping naturally
expresses sorrow, laughing, gladness, so does Religious bowing signify
Religious honoring, without any act of the free choice of the worshipped
intervening. It is impossible to adore God, in and through an Image, and give
no Religious reverence to the Image at all; as it is impossible to hear the
word and tremble at it; and yet none of that Religious trembling be bounded and
terminated upon the Word; as it is impossible to kneel to the Kings Ambassador
conveying all and whole that civil honor to the King, but some honor must
redound to the Ambassador; a father cannot love the Doctor for his sons cause,
but some love he must confer really upon the Doctor, if not absolute, yet
relative, for his sons cause. Jacob could not kiss Joseph his sons coat, and
yet refer that whole expressed affection to Joseph and nothing at all to the
coat, for then should there be no reason, why he should kiss the coat, rather
then the skin of the beast supposed to be the devourer of his son; if therefore
the Communicant should kiss the Sacramental Bread, as he boweth Religiously
before it, as the object of his Sacramental worship, which he receives, I
hope it would be thought very like the kissing of the Calves of Samaria, and a
Religious expression of love to the bread, and by the same case, Religious
bowing to God, by the interveening of bread a representative object, must be an
expression of Religious honoring of Bread, but no Religious honoring by
Religious bowing can be expressed, but Adoration of bread; for as I have
proved, it is not in our free Election that Religious kneeling signify what
honor we please, as if it were in our power, that Religious kneeling signify
Religious, or civil honor, or more, or less Religious honor, but our will
or thoughts cannot change the nature of things; kneeling is essentially
Religious, as Ioannes de Lugo, de mystei incarnat, disp. 13. S. 2. n. 14.
Johannes Delugo defines it, Nota submission is internae.

2. Suarez to. 1. in 3. q. 25. art. 5. S. 4. Objection of Suarez contending
that intention of adoring is essential to Adoration, removed.
Suarez objecteth, Adoration is a voluntary action proceeding from the will of
the Adorer; and therefore excluding this will, it is not Adorations, but only
the material action of adoring; also adoration is honoring, but none can
honor without an intention of honoring, and therefore he who externally gives
signs of honor to an Idol without an intention to honor the Idol, does not
truly honor and adore the Idol, but only dissembleth.

Ans. Qui been distinguit been solvit: Our third distinction does well answer
this: The naked material action of bowing Physically considered, wanting all
Religious will of adoring is not an honoring; if a Carpenter bow before an
Image to drive a nail in it, he does not worship the Image, because that is an
action, In statu artis, non in statu Religionis; In a state of Art, not in
(...) Religious state: But the voluntary bowing before any thing in a state of
worship, or Religion, as its here, is Adoration; for there is voluntary bowing
in a Religious way of a state, but there is not required a particular intention
to Adore the sign, that is accidental to the nature of worship.

Suarez objecteth, The e^^^nce of Adoration requires the intention of the
Adorer, therefore the adoring of this, or that thing, requires a
proportionable intention of adoring the thing.

Ans. 1. The Antecedent is not universally true, and is a begging of the
question, because external adoring of an Idol may be without intention to
adore an Idol. 2. Though the Antecedent were true; that an absolute Adoration
of God requires the intention of the doer, as it is not true; Lawful and
sincere Adoration indeed requires the intention, but not absolute adoration:
Though (I say) it were true, yet it follows not that a relative adoration
requires an intention of giving co-adoration or relative worship to the sign.

Suarez. 3. Objecteth: The honoring of one thing cannot properly be called the
honoring of another thing different therefrom, except that honoring be some
way referred by the mind, to that other thing, or except they be partakers one
of another; but the Image, and first samplar, or prototype are different
things, therefore the honoring of the first samplar cannot be called the
honoring of the Image, except the honoring by the intention be referred to
the Image. I answer, The Image and Samplar are one in a sinful imagination, as
Jehovah and the Golden Calf are one, but it follows not, that there must be
two distinct intentions, one in adoring the Prototype, and in coadoring the
Image another: But he who intends to honor the King in his Ambassadors
person, needs not two intentions, one by which he intends to honor the
King, another whereby he intends to honor his Ambassador.

SECT. II.
Whether the Idolatrous Jews were charged with the crime of Idolatry, because
they adored the creature as such, or because they adored the Godhead in, with,
or under the creatures shape? and whether or no, do Papists commit Idolatry
with them in this point:

LEt these considerations go before.

1. That the Jews believed the Image to be God by way of Of the Idolatrous
worship of the Jews and Papists.
representation, not essentially or really; they believed the Image to be God
objective, commemorative, representative, relative, declarative, significative;
Non essentialiter, non per se, non realiter.

2. There is an honor or negative r^verence due to any Image of God, ordained
by himself, or to any mean of honoring God, because it is such, though it
cannot be expressed in the act of Adoration; but the question is, if the honor
of adoration, either relative or absolute be due to the Image?

3. The Jews intended to honor Jehovah in their Images, what inferior
intention they had to honor the Image, we are now to inquire.

4. We bow our knee two ways before a creature, either before a creature as an
object by accident, as while we pray, there of necessity must be before us some
creature, a wall, a Table, a Pulpit, none of these are adored, because they are
before us by accident, as having no Religious state. The Image before the Jew,
and the Sacramental elements before the kneeler, cannot be thus present: 2.
The creature is before the kneeler, of Religious purpose, as a Religious object.

5. The Creature is Religiously present before the kneeler two ways, 1.
Active. 2. Passive. 1. In the mere and naked act of teaching and exciting the
memory, so that when that act is past, I turn from the creature, and adore the
Creator; So at the sight of the Sun or Moon being taught and instructed of the
wisdom and power of God, in creating such excellent creatures, I am to turn
from them, and adore the Lord of these creatures. Thus the creatures are
kindly and per se objects in the act of teaching, but not objects at all in
the act of adoration: 2. The creatures are objects passive, when bodily bowing
in a religious state is directed toward the creatures really and bodily present
by a commandment of the Church, or of purpose, and so they are made objects of
Adoration.

I. Conclusion. The relative expression of God which is in the The relative
expression of God in the creature, no ground of Adoring the creature.
works of God, is no formal ground of any Adoration of the creatures. 1.
Because Adoration upon this ground, though the creatures, the Host of Heaven
be excellent, is forbidden, Deuteronomy. 4. 19. 2. Not only Images (which cannot
represent God) and the Sacraments, but all the creatures, even, Rats, Mice,
Flies, Frogs, Worms, Judas and wicked men, yea, and Devils are to be
worshipped, because all things having being, are shadows and footsteps of God,
their cause, first Author, and last end, Psalm. 19. 1. Psalm. 103. 22. Romans 1.
19, 20. Act. 17. 27, 28, Prove. 16. 4. Rev. 4. 11. Romans 11. 36, 37* 3. Because
God is really, and by the diffusion of his blessed essenc^, present in all
creatures, it follows not that we should Adore them: The Formalists upon this
ground, that Christ is really present in the Sacrament, though the manner we
know not, think that Christ should be Adored in the Sacrament, according to
that, Verbum audimus, motum sentimus, modum nescimus. But if this be good
Logic, because we know not the way of the Spirit, and how the bones grow in a
woman with child, Eccles. 11. v. 5. And God, where he works, is present by
the immediation of essence and power, though we know not the way of his
presence, we are to Adore the soul of man, and the bones of a young child in a
woman's belly; and though they should say that God-man Christ is in a more
powerful and efficacious manner present in the Sacrament, then in the works of
nature; yet should it follow, that God is to be worshipped in the works of
nature also* for Magis and minus non variant speciem, for then we could not
conclude any thing but this: Though there be not so real a ground of Adoring
Lice and Frogs, as Adoring of the Sacrament: Yet there is a ground, seeing God
is, in the realli^y of his blessed essence, present in all creature^.

II. Con^lusion. The Idolatrous Jews did not. Adore the golden The Jews
believed not the golden Calf to be really God.
Calf, as a crea^ure, but as God by representation, Exodus 32. 4. And when Aaron
had made thereof a golden Calf, they said, These be thy Gods O Israel, which
brought thee up out of the Land of Egypt. 5. And when Aaron saw it, he built
an Altar before it, and Aaron made Proclamation, and said* To morrow is a Feast
to Jehovah. Now that they believed not the golden Calf to be really and
essentially Jehovah, is more then evident: 1. Because they believed not Moses
to be essentially God, but their guide and leader under God; but this Calf they
made to supply the want of Moses, v. 1. The people gathered themselves together
against Aaron, and said unto him, Up* make us gods which shall go before us:
For as for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the Land of Egypt, we
know not what is become of him. They made then the Calf only a visible God
under Jehovah, to lead them in Moses his place. 2. There is no reason why they
should have made Aaron rather the maker of the Calf then another; but because
he being the Lords Priest, they thought by his holiness, the God head of
Jehovah did slide into this Calf; and so they held the Calf to be a thing
different from Jehovah. 3. They say to Aaron, Make us gods: Ergo, they believed
Jehovah to be before this made Calf. 4. They saw the Calf melted before their
eyes, and knew it was made of their earrings. 5. They call it Jehovah, and yet
they made it Jehovah, and therefore they differenced betwixt the Calf and
Jehovah: for they knew that Jehovah brought them out of Egypt before the Calf
was framed, but the Calf was an Image of that Jehovah. Bellar. contr. tom. 2.
l. 2 c. 13.
Bellar. and Gregor. de Valent. to. 3. dis. 6. q. 11. de Idolat. punct. 6.
Gregor. de Valent. say, They worshipped not Jehovah, but a vain Idol: Else how
is it said, Psa. 106. when they made this Calf, that they forgot the Lord, if
they worshipped God in the Calf, they were mindful of God. It is vain
reasoning this, the wife that takes another Husband to bed with her, Morally
forgets her husband; and to worship God in a memorative sign forbidden of
God, is a forgetting of God, and a false God indeed. 2. Those who acknowledge
that the Heathen believe that some Godhead dwelt in Images, and gave Responses
and Answers out of them; do thereby acknowledge, that the Image it self had not
the honor of giving Responses, as God has, but that the enclosed Godhead gave
these Responses, and therefore the enclosed Godhead was that which they
worshipped. So Aquinas, par. 3. q. 25. art. 3. ad. 2. Adorabant Gentiles ipsas
imagines ut res quasdans, credcutes iis in esse al^* quid numi nis propter
responsa quae daemones in ipsis dabant, and alios mirabilcs effectus.
Aquinas, and Vasquez, in 3. tom. 1. q. 25. disp. 91. art. 3. Ver^ssimum est
quod tradit Augustinus Gentiles pro dijs habuisse ipsamet simulachra, putantes
in ipsis numen aliquod latere, cum illis responsa darent.
Vasquez says, The Heathen acknowledged a Godhead to dwell in the Images: And
Bellar. ibid.
Bellarmine says, It is not improbable that the Jews believed that they
worshipped the true God in an Idol: Papists then may take to them Heathens
Idolatry, for Heathens worshipped God in Images, and not Images as they are
such: and Abulensis, in Exodus 23.
Abulensis, and Cajetan, in Exodus 23.
Cajetan in the Commentaries of the first Edition, on Exodus, said this same.
3. Though the Jews believed the Calf to be essentially God, yet it was God as
God* that they intended to worship, not the work of men's hands as such: Papists
believe that the Image is not God, and yet give the highest worship that is to
them. 4. Bellarmine says with us, when he says, They saw a Calf in Egypt and
Adored it, they believed Jehovah himself to be a Calf, therefore they made the
image of a Calf, and Dedicated it to Jehovah. But (I Answer) That Image so
Dedicated, they worshipped as Jehovah, and called the very material Calf
Jehovah, and Dedicated it to the Honor of Jehovah; therefore they believed the
Lord Jehovah, and the Calf Dedicated to his Honor, (which Calf also they
worshipped) to be two diverse things, as the Image and the thing signified are
Relata and opposite: Ergo, they believed not that that Image which Aaron had
made, was Jehovah essentially; therefore in setting up that Image, they
worshipped it not as a creature. All the Prophets (says he) proves that the
Idols are not gods, because they speak not, they neither see, nor hear, Isa.
46. Psalm. 113. But (say some Papists) there was no question if they did see and
hear by way of naked representation, because they represented gods and men in
shape, who see and hear. Ans. first, If all granted they were living things,
which did hear and see by representation; the Prophets did well to prove, they
should not be trusted in, nor feared as Images, nor should that Godhead within
them enclosed, be feared, because it cannot speak with the mouth, nor see, nor
hear, nor walk, with their eyes, ears, and feet: and so it was a vain thing to
make it a representation of God, who by serving these dead things did help
them. But the Prophets strongly prove these Images, and the supposed Godheads
in them, were dumb, deaf, blind, and dead; and therefore neither sign, nor
supposed deity represented by the sign, was to be Adored. Also, Isa. 40. 18. To
whom then will ye liken God? Or what likeness will ye compare unto him? 19.
The Workman melts a graven Image, and the Goldsmith spreads it over with
gold, etc. Isa. 46. 5, 6. To whom will ye liken me? and make me equal, and
compare me, that we may be alike? 9. I am God, and there is none else; I am
God, and there is none like me. Then it is more then clear that they made a
likeness, a comparison, and a similitude betwixt the golden Image and Jehovah:
Ergo, they believed not that the Image was essentially God; for every thing
like to another, must be diverse from that to which it is like (they being
relatives and opposites) the one cannot be essentially the other; and he
proves they are not God by representation, Isa. 46. They cannot move out of
their places, except they be born upon Asses or men's shoulders: And this is the
Holy Ghosts Argument, I am God, Ergo, there is none like me by representation
to be worshipped: All assimilation or comparative likeness made by man,
betwixt Jehovah and God, is an Idolatrous assimilation; yea the Lords Argument,
Isa. 46. is this, every thing made like unto me, before which ye fall down to
worship, as a memorative Image of me, must be a living thing at least, that can
move out of his place, and answer your cry when ye pray, and save you out of
trouble, ver. 7. Isa. 46. And yet it is but a likeness of God, ver. 6. Now I
Assume, but the Papists Image, and the Formalists Sacramental elements before
which they Religiously kneel, cannot move out of their place, nor answer the
Prayers of those who bow to them, nor save them out of trouble: Ergo, they
cannot be Adored as Images, with Religious bowing* nor can they say, the Images
or Sacramental elements can teach and represent God. I Answer, So did the
Jewish Images represent God, and yet God convinces them of Idolatry, Isa. 40.
18. Isa. 46. 6, 7. Ier. 10. They were but Doctrines of Vanity and Lies, and
Hab. 2 19. Woe be to him who says to the Wood, Awake, and to the dumb stone,
Arise, it shall teach. And though the Sacramental elements be lawful teaching
and representing signs, as being the Ordinances of Christ Jesus; yet the
office of teaching cannot elevate and extol them to the state of Religious
worship, because though the elements be lawful Images, and in this they differ
from Jewish and Popish Images; yet that which is Adored must be such as can
hear Prayers, Isa. 46. 7. though it be the Image of God. But the Sacramental
elements are not such as can hear Prayer, etc.

Also, that the Adoring of Images is not forbidden by a Ceremonial The Adoring
of Images not forbidden by the Ceremonial, but by the Moral Law.
Law only, is clear: 1. By Gods Argument, (Isa. 40. 18.) To whom will ye liken
me? That is, no created thing can represent God, which is of man's devising (for
the elements of Gods institution do represent Christ) and Isa. 46. 9. I am God,
and there is none beside me: Ergo, no invention of man can represent me. This
Argument is taken from Gods nature, and therefore is of perpetual verity. 2.
The Apostle Paul in the New Testament repeateth this same Argument, Act. 17. to
the heathen Athenians who were tied by no Ceremonial Law of God, ver. 29. We
ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto Gold; You see these people
are challenged of Idolatry, who did but erect an Altar to the golden likeness
and Image of God, and yet they did not worship that golden Image, as such; but
they worshipped in, and by the Image, v. 23, 24. The God preached by Paul who
made the world.

Hear what Suarez tom. 3. q. 25. dis. 1. in 54. art. 3 Sect. 2.
Suarez Bellar. to. 2. de relig. sanct. lib. 2. c. 8. The evasions of
Bellarmine and Suarez answered.
Bellarmine and Papists say, It is not Lawful to represent God by a proper and
formal similitude, which represents his essence; but it is Lawful to
represent him by Images Analogically, signifying such a form or shape in the
which he appeared in Scripture, according to these metaphors, and mystical
significations, that are given to him in Gods word.

Ans. 1. Why should not unwritten Traditions (which to Papists are Gods word)
express to us Gods nature in Images, no less then the written word? 2. The
Heathen did represent God by the Image of a man, with eyes, nose, tongue, ears,
head, hands, feet, heart, understanding, all which are given to God in
Scripture, yet were they Idolaters in so doing, because God says, Isa. 46. 9.
I am God, and there is none like to me. 3. If we may portraict* God according
to all metaphors given unto him in Scripture, then ye may Portraict him, in the
shape of a Lion, a Leopard, a Bear, a Man full of wine, a Thief stealing in the
night, an unjust Judge, a Giant, a man of War on horseback, etc. All which
were folly; and we might worship a Lion, a Bear, an unjust Judge, a thief
stealing in the night, a man mad with the spirit of jealousy. 4. The Essence
and specific nature of nothing in Heaven and earth, can be portraicted or
painted, no more then Gods essence; all painted things are but such and such
things by external proportion and shape; and it is unreasonable to say that
Portraicts and Pictures of God, Physically impossible to the Art of Craftsmen,
are forbidden only (whereas the Lords word sets down to us no precepts for
Art, as for painting, Music, speaking right Latin) whereas the Lord
forbids universally Gods pictures in any thing in heaven, on earth, or under
the earth, Deuteronomy. 4. 15. Take ye therefore good heed to your selves, for ye saw
no manner of Image on the day that the Lord spoke to you in Horeb out of the
midst of the fire.

Gregor de Valent. says, We give not divine honor to the creature (c)Joannes
Rotnaldus de idolatri^ Ecclesiae Roman, lib. 2. cap. 9.
as to God, or to Christ, for that honor pertains to God or Christ, which
conciliateth to him reverence due to God only, and that opinion of divine
honor is conciliated to God, or Christ, Coram, and in imaginibus, before, and
in, or through the Image.

Ans. The people of God had not that opinion every way of Egypt, (d) Valent.
ibid.
and their horses, that they had of God; and yet when they, (c) Lindsey
pretended Bishop of Edinbrough parth. Assembly, page 29.
Isa. 31. give that to Egypt and horses, which is due to God, to wit, their
Faith and confidence, that they could save in the time of trouble, therefore
interpretatively they made Gods of them; otherwise they knew literally, that
Pharaohs horses were flesh and not spirit: but Morally and spiritually they
knew them not to be no Gods to save them: It is no more absurd that the
Prophets say, The Idol has eyes and see not, and that it is not God, though by
sense they knew it not to be God, but by representation they trusting in the
Idol as in God, then it was for Isaiah to say, The horses of Egypt are flesh
and not spirit: A wife, if she give her body to a stranger, though not with
that opinion of love and respect which is only due to her husband, is yet an
harlot, and the people who swear by Jehovah, and by Malcome, who worship
Jehovah, and Ieroboams Calves, and those who worship the Image of an Ash-Tree,
representing Jehovah, Isa. 40. 18. Isa. 46. 6, 7. did not give honor to
Malcom, to the Calves, to the Images, Sicut Iehovae, as to God. See Roinalds
Answer. But (says he) we cannot worship God, but we must conceive some Image
of God in our mind, are we therefore Idolaters, because in these Images we
worship God? and Valent. says, and so does the Formalist Lindsey say, That God
may be adored before the Sacramental elements as Images. Ans. We are not
forbidden to adore God in the inward conception of mind, Deuteronomy. 4. Ye saw no
manner of similitude, but not, yea thought no manner of thoughts of God. 2. The
internal image of God in the mind is the objective conception of God as
conceived in the mind there is no hazard of Idolatry there, for that Image is
not adorable at all, because then it must be conceived by a new different
Image, and that new different Image must be cognoscible by another new Image,
and so in infinitum. The external Image is both made an active object to
represent God, and when we religiously bow to it, it is made an object passive,
that is adored with God.

Lastly, If the Jews and heathen had adored their Images, as they were such
creatures consecrated, and as essentially Gods, the Lord would not have rebuked
them for making an Ash Tree the similitude of a God, as he does, Isa. 40. 18.
Isa. 44. 9, etc. And all that I said in the former question proves the same.
So that though Divine honor in the Act of kneeling before the elements be
intended to Christ, yet because the elements are there as actual signs, and
Vicegerent Images of Christ, if we kneel to Christ Religiously through them, we
give them divine honor, though we should intend to honor Christ Jesus only.

SECT. III.
Whether Papists and Formalists give that divine honor that is proper only to
God and his son Jesus Christ to Images, and the elements of Bread and Wine?

I. Con. TO adore Images is to give worship to God before Images, or, in, or
through the Images without any Faith of a Godhead, or divine power in the Image
according to the Doctrine of the Church of Rome. I prove this out of their
Councels. Council. triden. Sess. 25. Statuimus imagines in templis habendas and
retinendas ijsquedebitum honorem and vencrationem impertiendam; non quod
credatur esse aliqua in his di vinitas, vel virtus propter quam sint colendae:
sed quoniam honos qui iis exhibetur, refectur ad Prototypa, quae illa
repraesentant, ut per imagines quas osculamur, et coram qui bus caput aperimus
and procumbimus, Christum adorcmus and sanctos, quorum illasimilitudinem gerunt.
The Council of Trent says, Due honor and veneration is due to the Images,
not because it is believed, that there is any Divinity and virtue in them, for
the which they should be worshipped; but because the honor given to them is
referred to the samplar, which they represent; that by these Images which we
kiss, and before which we uncover our head and bow down; we may adore
Christ, and the Saints which these Images resembles: Hence 1. the Image does
but, as a memorative object, excite the affection to give honor to God, in,
and through the Images; but 2. Let these words be examined, the Council
denies any divinity to be in Images, but if they mean no divinity really to be
in Images, so they say nothing against us; for we do not ascribe to Papists
that they teach there is a real Godhead in the Image, but that all that is
really in it, is Wood, Gold, or Metal, and so did the Gentiles believe their
Images to be teaching books, Hab. 29. Ier. 10, 8. Deuteronomy. 4. 19. Isa. 40. 18. and
46. 6, 7. Act. 17. 29. and gold and silver; but say they, What needed the
Prophets to prove that gold and silver could not see, nor hear, nor deliver in
time of trouble, reason would here convince them to be ten times blind, who
believed any such thing. Ans. The Prophets do Papists did of old adore before,
or at the presence of the Image as a memorative sign, and yet were Idolaters.
well to do so: Nor that the Heathen believed there was any Godhead in them
formally, but because they ascribed actions to these images, that were due to
living creatures, and made them to be such as did see, hear, move, deliver; So
Isaiah proves Egypts horses not to be God, but flesh, yet they did not believe
there was a Godhead in the horses, but Consequenter, by good consequence, when
they laid that hope on the horse, that they were to lay upon God, he had need
to say the horse was flesh and not God: So when men give to these things,
bowing of the body, and say unto a stock, Thou art my Father: God may prove the
stock is not a living man, and has no senses, to convince them the more, that
they can far less be Gods Vicar; for a Vicar or Deputy creature representing
the living God, should be such as can do what God does; else we should put on
it the honor due to God: But if the Council mean, They have no divinity in
them, but by way of representation, because they be Vicaria dei signa, signs
resembling the Creator God; Now if this be denied, the images must be naked
memorials before which people do adore God, as Mirandula, Durandus and others
said, and yet latter Papists say more of their own Images: But I would have it
remembered, that there be two sorts of deputed or Vicar-Images; some that do
only signify, as the darkness of the Sky going before the morning light in
the East, that does nothing at all which the morning light does, but nakedly
signifies that the Sun is rising: There be other Depute signs that can
exercise acts, Two sort of signs.
which the samplar would do, if it were present, as the deputy is not a naked
Vicar or depute sign of the King, for he does not only signify the Kings
mind, but can do Royal Acts in the Kings name: Images are depute signs of
God, of the first sort, that do only rub the memory and understanding, and
therefore deserve no honor except the honor due to the means of worship, as
the Bible, Sacraments, which deserve not Adoration, but only a Negative
Reverence, or a not dispising or contemptuous handling of them, Images being
unlawful means, and not Commanded of God, deserve no Veneration at all; and
though it be true, that the Ambassador deserve Princely Honor, for the
Princes Place, whom he represents; yet he can act the person of the Prince,
and is not a naked deputed sign, but Images are therefore convinced to be
unlawful deputies representing (as Idolaters made them to be, Isa. 40. 18.
Isa. 46. 6, 7.) Because they can do no acts at all, nor exercise any actions
proper to the samplar, for Psalm. 115. v. 6. They have mouths, but they speak
not, eyes they have, but they see not, 7. They have ears, but they hear not;
and therefore should not be trusted in, as in means and deputed representations
of God, for which cause the Prophet infers ver. 8. They that made them, are
like unto them, so are every one that trusts in them. ver. 9. O Israel trust
thou in the Lord. Therefore Religious trusting in them is Idolatry: But the
Canon of Trent says this same of their Images, to wit, that there be no
Godhead or virtue in them. 2. If the worship of (...), the higher service due
to God, be given to Images, as I prove hereafter, then also some deity or
Divine virtue; for Gods highest honor can no more be communicated to any, save
to God, then the Godhead it self; for a Relative Godhead is as due to stocks,
as a relative worship. 3. If the Tridentine Canonists will have divine
Adoration given to God Coram imaginibus, before Images, or at their presence,
as only memorative signs, and active objects exciting us to worship God, then
is our Thesis proved: But if they mean that God is Adored, Coram imaginibus,
before images, as not only memorative and active objects, but also before them
as passive objects, that are compartners under God of some divine adoration;
then I say 1. they contradicted themselves, for Gods highest honor called
(...), can not be given to them but by a figure, because they are Gods, and
have divinity in them only by a figure, and not really: for Suarez and Vasquez
denies that we can fix our hope and faith in Images, or make prayers to them,
Nisi modo figurativo and tropo duriore, by a figure, and a hard troop, and most
improperly and by that same reason must be given to stocks and stones most
improperly, and that is, men do religiously bow before them, as before
memorative objects. 2. Gabriel Vasquez tom. 1. in 3. art. 3. dis. 108. cap. 8.
In imagine praeter ipsius prototypi excellentiam non potest esse aliqua virtus,
cui cultus debeaturest enim in imagine solum irrationale and inanimatum
excellenciae and sanctitatis exemplar, cui homo nequit digne sese submittere
Adoratione.
Vasquez says well, There can be no footstep of holiness in the image, beside
the excellency of the samplar, nor any divine virtue wherefore it should be
worshipped; for there is nothing in the image of it self, but that which is
senseless, and lifelesse, and spiritlesse and no man can in a Religious way
submit himself to such a creature? Hence it must be a naked memorative sign,
and therefore the kissing of the Image, though Physically it be real, and not
Metaphysicall, yet moral it is not propper, seeing all religious affection in
that kissing is transferred to God. And we know Vasquez allows, that every
thing, as it is a being, and resembles God the first being, is to be Adored,
and so stones, -- Frogs, the Devil, Judas lips that kissed Christ, are to be
Adored.

So their seventh pretended Synod 7. Synodus, Quo scilicet per banc imaginum
pictarum inspectionem, omnes qui contemplantur, ad prototyporum memoriam and
desiderium veniant, illisque Adorationem honorariam exhibeant, non secundum
fidem nostram, veram latreiam.
faith, That the Honor due to God is not to be given to images, according to
our faith, only at the beholding of Pictures we are put in mind of the
samplar: And the same says Mr. Lindesey, is the way of Adoring God in the
Sacrament. But so the Gentiles, as says Arnobius lib. 6. Gentes Adorabans
statuas, non quod as, aurum, argentum and similes statuarum materi^ dij sint,
sed quod little, quae alias invisibiles sunt, praesentia per simulachra
exhibeatur.
Arnobius, and Lactantius, de institut. ad Constantium. lib. 2. cap. 2. Non
ipsa (inquiunt Gentes) simulachra tim^nus, sed ea ad quorum imaginem facta, and
quorum nominibus consecrata sunt. Resp. Lactantius nempe ^deo t^metis quod cos
in caelis esse Arbitramini, cur igitur o^ul^s in caelum non tollitis? Cur ad
parictes lig^a and lapides potius, quam e^ spectatis, ubi eos esse creditis.
Lactantius, yea, and the Apostle Act, 17. 29.
Paul ^aith Adored images; yea, and God would Deuteronomy. 4. 15. Isa. 40. 18. and 46.
6, 7, 8, 9.
not forbid similitudes of God to be Adored, except he did teach that the
heathen Idolaters worshipped similitudes, and so the Papists in that vulgar
verse said, they Adored not the Images, but the thing signified by the Images.

Effigiem Christi dum transis, semper Adora:
Non tamen effigiem, sed quod designat, Honora.
Let me add these reasons to prove they cannot Adore the Image, but as a
memorative sign: 1. The Image and the elements in any consideration, either as
creatures, or as the honorable act of representation is put upon them, are but
creatures; for the act of representation is a temporary Godhead, and makes
them but Time-Gods; Ergo, they cannot be Adored. 2. If there be two Adorations
here, one given to God, and another to the Image, and if both be divine honor,
there must be two collateral Gods; if Adoration prove Christ to be God, two
divine honors put upon things, one upon God, and another upon the Creature;
there must be two Gods, or then the Creature remaining a Creature, must have
Communion with Gods high honor, which is Idolatry. 3. Images and elements are
either worshipped for themselves* or for some other thing; if for themselves,
they are God, for only God for himself is worshipped with Divine honor; if for
God they be worshipped, then it is an inferiotr, and improper worship, and
therefore they must be worshipped as memorative objects. 4. Images and
elements, if they partake of external worship proper to God: Why may not
Sacrifices and Incense be offered unto them, and faith and hope fixed on
Images? They do not partake of internal worship: for as Vasquez says well,
inward worship consists in Apprehensione primi principii, and in motu ad
illud; in apprehension of the first Author and Creator of all things, and in
the wills motion toward it. But this apprehension cannot be put upon Images or
elements, therefore they be here significant objects only.

So their second Council Concilium Nicen. 2. Qu^d si in recordationem atquc
memoriam, ita quod salutari quadam affectione in ipsa prototypa ferebantur
(Catholici) salutaverint and honorifice A^oraverint imaggines, non tamen ob id
ill is latreiam exhibuera^t, aut Divinam Venerationem adscripserunt, absit haec
calumnia.
of Nice, as Epiphanius a Deacon, in name of the Synod says, Images were
present before the kneelers, as our elements are, only as memorative objects.
2. That the singular affection of Adoring, was bounded only upon God: And
Concilium S^^^nense Cap. 14. Definit imagines debere adorari non quia in illis
aliquid numinis creditur inesse, sed ob recordationem exemplaris.
Concilium Senonense says, Images are to be Adored, not because there is any
Godhead in them, but for the memory of the samplar: And Concilium Mogunt. Cap.
41. Pastores nostri populum accurate moncant imagnes non ad id proponi, ut
adoremus aut colamus cas, sed ut quod adorare and col^re aut quarum rerum
utiliter, -- meminisse debemus, per imagines recordemur.
Concilium Moguntinum, Images are not propounded that we should worship them,
but that we may call to mind the things which we are to worship. If therefore
we Adore God at the presence of the elements, as memorative signs we do Adore
the elements; but if the kneeler direct all his worship before the elements, to
Christ up at the right hand of the Father: Why then (as Lactantius said well to
the Gentiles) do they not turn away their senses and eyes off the elements? For
Christ is not substantially enclosed in them, and lift them up toward heaven,
where they believe Christ to be? But in so doing the elements should not be
received as Sacraments, for in the act of receiving we are to fix our souls
upon the visible elements: If the Athenians did believe the golden image, Act.
17. 29. was essentially God, and kneeled to it as to God; Paul did in vain
rebuke them for believing that the Godhead was like silver or gold; and if the
men of Lystra believed the shapes of men, and the likeness of men to be
essentially God, and in that respect gave the honor of Sacrificing due to God,
to these shapes; then the Scripture in vain should bring these men of Lystra
in, as putting a difference betwixt the shapes of men, and the Godhead of
Jupiter and Mercurius, to which they were about to give Divine Sacrifice. And
if Formalists kneel before the elements, and give a transitive glory to Christ
through them, they are in the same sense Idolaters that the Gentiles were. So
the Council of Moguntine, Council. Mogunt. ib. Sect. 2. Codi^^m oculis
perlustrans, cum ad venerabile and tremendum nomen, Jesus devenerit, caput
aperit, inclinatur, and suspirans in caelum oculos attolit, and ob id omni

atramento pinguntur, honorat, sed cogitatione and veneratione mentis suae ad
eum honorandum and venerandum rapitur, cujus memoriam hae literae ei suggerunt.
and Alphonsus de Castro Alphons. de Castro heraes. 1. denique adoratio ipsa,

deny that they Adore the letters of the Name (Jesus) drawn with base ink* or
the Tree of the Cross; but they Adore the signified thing: Yea, says Thom.
Waldens* de sacram. tom. 3. cap. 156. nu. 6.
Waldensis, He that beholds the image, almost forgets the image, while as
he is ravished with the thing signified: as many see a man clothed, and yet
being asked, they cannot declare the color of his clothes, the mind is so
much set upon the man: Yea, the Adorer may hate the painted image of Christ,
because the rude ignorance of the painter, when he Adoreth Christ in the same
image, though he may love some moral representation in it. This Doctrine is
taught by Grego. lib. 7. Epist. ad Secund. q. 53.
Gregorius, and by Adrianus, de imaginibus, cap. 12.
Adrianus, and Concilium Romanum sub Stephano 3. Et nos quidem non quasi ante
Divinitatem, ante illam (imaginem aut elementa sacramentalia) prosternimur, sed
illam adoramus, quem per imaginem natum, passum, aut in throno seden^em
recordamur.
approved by a Council at Rome under Stephanus the third.

II. Conclusion. Grosser Papists go a subtiler way to work, and do avouch that
the very Latreia and supreme worship that is proper to God, is given to the
Image.

Though the creature says Suarez; Tom 3. in 1. disp. 54. Sect. 4.
Suarez cannot, Primo, and per se, principally, kindly, and of it self be
worshipped or adored with Latreia, the supreme worship due to God, yet it may
be co-adored, with the same honor that is given to Christ, as is the Kings
purple Robe: So the first Distinction is of Adoration and co-Adoration, or
Adoration kindly, and by it self, and Adoration with another. Henriquez
Henriquez sum. Theolog. Moral. lib. 8. cap. 32. Male quidam negant praedican*
dum populo, quod image Christi si^ adoranda. Latreia.
says, It is a fault that it is not preached to the people, that the image of
Christ is to be adored with supreme worship called Latreia Cabrera, in 3. page

15. Vnamquanque imaginem, eodem cultu, quo illum cujus est image, verereremur.
Iacobus de Graphiis, Let us worship (says he) every Image with that same
worship, with which we worship the samplar: That is, let us bestow the worship
highest of Latreia, upon the Image of God and Christ, and the sign of the
Cross, as it brings us in mind of Christ's suffering: The second distinction
is, that the Image is truly properly adored, as the material object no less
then the samplar: Hence they reprove Durandus, Picus Mirandula, Hulcot, and
others, who say that Images are improperly adored, and Raphael de la Torres,
sum. Theolog. de relig. to. 1. in 22. q. 84. art. 2. disp. 5. q. 94. dub. 5.
Respondetur modus iste dicendi (per accidens adorantur) ^ic debet intelligi,
idest per aliud, vel (quod idem est) ratione alterius; hoc autem non arguit
improprietatem adorationis, sed nega^ adorationem excellentiae proprie and
residentis in re adorata; sic adoratur humanitas Christi. See also Bellarm. de
imag c. 21. c. 25. Neque dicendum eas impropre venerandas esse, quia quod non
dicitur nisi improprie, simpliciter negari potest.
Raphael de la Torres answering to that of Durandus and Mirandula, That Images
are adored by accident, in respect that before them, and at their naked
presence, as before memorative objects, we adore God and Christ (says he) (are
adored by accident) is thus to be understood, Images are adored, Ratione
Alterius, by reason of another, Vel per aliud, by another thing, but this
argues not that Images are improperly adored, hereby only is denied that
there is any adoration of the proper excellency of the thing adored. Hence he
would say that the borrowed honor of Adoration given to the Image is truly and
properly the Adoration that is due to God, but it is given to the Image in
reference to God, and not for any inherent Excellency that is in the Image: For
(says he) If we do not properly adore the Image, we do but exercise the
material action of kissing and kneeling to the image, without any internal
affection of submission to the Samplar: He adds that it is enough that the
intention of submission is referred to the samplar, and the external Adoration
to the Image, for if any shall (says he) kiss the earth (as the rude
multitude in some place does) upon an intention of inward submission of heart
to God, Nequaquam vere and proprie adorat terram, he does not truly and
properly adore the earth, but only he exercises a material action of kissing
toward the earth: But I answer, all this is vanity, for such Diversevasions of
Papists touching the worshipping of images.
a one worshippeth the earth, but refers the internal submission to God,
and all this, is to say the Image does truly partake of the Religious honor (
Latreia) due to God only.

A third distinction is here, of Gabriel Bi^l in can* missae. lect. 49. fol. 92.
Gabriel Biel on the Canon of the Mass, In the Adoring of images (says he)
and of other things which are adored by accident, though there be an external
act of bowing both to the images and the samplar, yet there be two internal
acts which are different, whereof one is terminated and bounded upon the
image, not absolutely as it is such a material thing of stone, or metal, but
as it is an image: This is an acknowledgement whereby I esteem the Image a
thing ordained to represent Christ, or a complacency whereby I rest on such a
thing, as to be honored for Christ, and the other i^ a recognition, and
acknowledgement immediately terminated and bounded upon the samplar, whereby it
is acknowledged to be the chiefest good. But the truth is, Religious
geniculation before the image, or at the presence of the image (says Duran.
lib. 3. did. 9. q. 2. ^. 10. Sed quia loqendum est ut plures, ideo commune
dictum sic exponendum est, quod protanto dicitur imago sub ratione imaginis
adorari eadem adoratione cum re, cujus est imago, quia ad praesentia^ imaginis
seu signifit rem^moratio rei, quam rememoratam adoramus, eadem adoratione ac si
presens esset in se* ^t ideo concedi potest quod signa et imagines adorantur.
Durandus) as if the samplar were there present, is one and the same adoration
given to the image and the samplar; and all that Greg. ^9. de Val^^. to. 3.
dis. 6. q. 11. de idol pun. 6.
Gregorius de Valentia says against this, is, that Durandus minus circumspect^
locutus, he spoke not so warily, as need were: And so did their Sept. Syn. ar.
14.
seventh pretended synod speak, as L^^n. lib. 5. Apol. Syn. 7. ar. 14.
Leontius expounds them, Non liguorum aut colorum naturam adoro, absit, and
Vasq. in 3. q. 25. ar. 3. dis. 106. c. 1.
Vasquez says, They displease some in so speaking, but they mean well: They
meant all that which our Formalists do* and there is no discord (says G. Bi^^
in can. mis. lect. 49. fol. 94.
Gabriel Biel) in re, in the matter it self; for both say; 1. that the creature
should not be adored with the highest honor ( Lateria) of it self, as if it
were the object of Adoration: 2. Both teach that the mind and affection is
carried toward the samplar, which is adored: 3. Both mean that the adorer
exercises some act upon the image, as it represents the samplar, only the
diversity is, if this act terminated on the Image, should be called an adoring
of the Image; and all these three Formalists do to the elements in the supper:
Hence I require of the Formalists, one difference betwixt the objective
presence of the elements before the kneeler, in the act of receiving, and the
objective presence of the Heathens image of God, Isa. 40. 18. and 46. 6, 7, 8.
and the Papists image of dumb wood, and blind stone: Mr. Lindsey answered me
once in a conference, That the elements were present as the Ordinances of God,
but the Popish and Heathen images as the inventions of men. I replied to him,
That is no answer: for images and elements (I know) do differ, Physica specie;
The Sun adored by Persians, and Satan by Indians differ. Satan and the Sun, are
not Ejusdem speciei, of that same nature, but it is idolatry to worship either;
images and bread in the kind of means of worship differ, but, as touching the
objective presence before the kneeler kneeling to these, there is no
difference: as 1. To memorative objects: 2. As to objects vicarious and
standing in the room of Christ: 3. At their presence and through them God is
adored. Suarez tom. 1. in 3. quest. 25 art. 3. disp. 53. Sect. 3. Qui visa
pulchrae creaturae specie animo insurgit ad considerationem creatoris, and
illum laudat acdiligit, non potest vere dic^ landere ac diligore creaturam,
etiam si presentia creaturae excitaverit a^^-rem creatoris; ideoque tantum
(^ic) propter memoriam retinendae imagines.
Suarez, is not content with the doctrine of Durandus here, By this, images are
(says he) but occasions, Vel signa excitantia hominem ad prototypum adorandum,
non vero ^es quae adorantur, or signs moving the m^n to adore the samplar, but
they are not things adored: for (says he) the man, who seeing a beautiful
creature, arises in ^is mind to the consideration of the Creator, and
therefore praises and loves the Creator, cannot be truly said to praise and
love that fair creature, thoug^ the presence of that creature have stirred up
the love of the Creator, and by this means images are reserved only for memory.
Thus he will have images adored with the same worship that is given to God: But
I answer: 1. if he shall kiss that creature and direct Religious bowing toward
it, and and through that external Religious act, convey his worship to God, and
give no other external adoration and sign of heart submission to God, then
that which is tied and alligated of purpose to that fair creature, as Papists
and Jews did of old, who kissed the calves, and fell down before the images, as
Isa. 44. 17. which yet were but memorials of Jehovah teaching them of Jehovah,
Esa. 40. 18. Esa. 46. 6, 7. Hab. 2. 18, 19. Such a one should also worship that
fair Suarez is not content at the hungry and unproper expressione of Durandus,
Mir^ndula, H^lcot.
creature: Our Formalists do not make the elements memorative signs
representing Christ, for that they have by divine institution, but upon that
ground they kneel before them, and tie, by the Churches Commandment, the
external Religious bowing toward them, and that (says the act of our new
Assembly at Perth) in reverence of God, and in due regard (Religious regard
they must mean) of so divine a mystery, and in remembrance of so mystical a
union: 2. God has no other external bowing made to him in the act of
receiving, then is made before these elements, in due regard of so divine a
mystery, and because of so mystical union; the union is real, whether it be
by consubstantiation, or transubstantiation, they will not define, the Lord
Jesus is present in the elements, in a more real and spiritual manner, then
he is in any groundless image of metal or wood; and therefore the image and
elements do most really partake even by Durandus and Hulcot, and Mirandula
their mind of that worship of ( Latreia) due to God; only Durandus (as
Vasquez, and Gregor. Valent. say) spoke not so warily, but not so grossly, as
to say, What ever is given to God, is given to the image: 2. It is not in the
Adorers power that kneeling should be a sign of less worship, as referred to
the image, and of greater, as referred to God; for the same material kissing,
and Religious Prostration, which would immediately be conveyed to Christ, if he
were in person present in the image and elements, is done to the image and
elements, and Religious kissing, and Religious kneeling signifies internal
divine submission of heart to God, as the first author of all, and the last
end, not by man's will, but by divine institution. 3. Kneeling to God is a
protestation (says Gregor. de Valent. to. 3. disp. 6. q. 11. de idolat. punct.
6. Cum autem per idem officium and motum animi vere etiam dicimus honorem
exhiberi imagini, verbo, illi exhiberi, hoc sub est, nos Prototypon ex imagine
cogitantes, coram ipsa actionem honorificam proinde ac si prototypon similiter
esset praesens, exercentes, velle prototypi excellentia protestari, adcoque de
ipso excitare opinionem excellentem, ut est quodammodo, nimirum relative in
imagine sua.
Gregor, de Valent.) That we are willing to raise an opinion of excellency in
God, as this excellency is in some manner, and relatively in the image. If
therefore kneeling of its own nature, without any act of man's will, or the
Churches institution, wanting Gods Word, do conciliate an opinion What need we
dispute? to give that external knee-worship to bread, which we would give to
Christ substantially and personally present, is to adore bread.
of excellency; to whomsoever kneeling is directed, in this it must conciliate
the same opinion: if then it it be given to Images and elements, it must be a
protestation that we are willing to conciliate an opinion of Divine excellency
in these lifelesse creatures, which is all we give to God by kneeling. 4. It is
not enough that Valentia says, This honor belongs to Christ, in so far as
it conciliateth to Christ the honor due only to God, and is expressed by
kneeling, and it belongs to the images so, as Coram, and in illis, before,
and in them this opinion is conciliated to Christ: But if the image be God only
representatively, and by way of signification, then is it not God of it self
and really, Quod est tale tantum significative, non est tale per se, and
realiter, as a painted man is not of it self, and really a man; the word (
Jesus) as written with base ink, is not infinite Jesus, the mighty God, the
Prince of Peace, really, but only in mere signification: therefore to give Gods
honor and external Religious bowing (which essentially does note the highest
excellency of God) to them, is Idolatry: It is a vain thing to say, The
Ambassador is not really the King; yet the real honor due to the King, is
done to him. I Answer, where the King declares that it is his will, that his
Ambassador be really honored as himself; this is not the giving of the Kings
glory to another against his will: But here expressly contrary to that ( Thou
shall not bow down to them) expounded especially of similitudes, Deuteronomy. 4. 15.
Ye saw no manner of similitude. The glory of Religious bowing contrary to Gods
will, ( Who will not give his glory to another) is given to images, and to
Bread. 2. It redoundeth kindly to the King, who is absent, and to be obeyed in
his absence, that His Vicegerent and Deputy be honored as himself, and
presupposes an infirmity in the King that he cannot be in many places to
receive immediately the honor due to him, and therefore will have that due
paid to himself, mediately, by the honored person of a Deputy. God infinite is
in all places, to receive immediately the pay of Religious knee-honour, and it
dishonors God to have his glory laid down in the hand of any creature; as it
dishonors the Husband that his wife give her body to another, representing
his person: For this cause Bernar. Puiol. de ador. disp. 3. Sect. 7. Quarto
colligitur contra Durandum ipsas imagines proprie adorari.
Bernardus Puiol faith, Images are properly to be Adored, contrary to that
which Durandus says: And Azor. instit. moral. tom. 1. lib. 9. c. 6. 4. Distin.
Azorius says, It is the common opinion that Images are to be worshipped with
(Latreia) the highest honor due to God: So (says he) Thomas, Alexander,
Bonaventura, Richardus, Albertus, Paludanus, Alman, Marsilius, Capreolus,
Cajetanus, and caeteri juniores sic sentiunt.

The fourth expression of wit, is this distinction of Vasquez ut supr. dis.
108. Per totum.
Vasquez, That that internal submission to God, as to the Creator and chief
God, is due to God only; and that the image, seeing it is a Creature, is not
capable of that high honor. But the external act of kissing and kneeling, he
will have due to the image, for the excellency of the Samplar. And so he
denies contrary to Suarez, That the image separated from the Samplar, or the
humanity of Christ separated from Divinity, can be Adored: But if external
Adoration may be given to images; so also internal submission: ( Thou shall
not bow down to them) Religiously it is expounded in the second Commandment, (
Thou shall not Worship them.) It is grossness in Vasquez to say, The
Worshipping of images was forbidden the Jews in the second Commandment, as a
Ceremonial inhibition, because of the Jews propension to idolatry: But Act.
17. 29. Paul expounds the second Commandment, Forbidding the similitude of
God: And the Athenians were not under the Law of Ceremonies. Ioannes Joannes de
Lugo, de mist. incar. disp. 34. Sect. 2. n. 29.
de Lugo says, This is a probable opinion: But it is clear, Cornelius a devout
man, one who feared and worshipped God, whose Prayers were heard in heaven for
Christ's sake, knew that Peter was a man which lodged in the house of Simon a
Tanner; yet his Religious external bowing (though he knew Peter was not God,
but a Divine man resembling God) by Peter is rebuked as idolatry, Act. 10. v.
25, 26. I cannot help Joan. Ibid. disp. 35. Sect. 1. n. 6.
de Lugo, to say, That Peter forbade Cornelius to worship him, not because it
was a sin, but for modesties cause. But 1. Peter's Argument strikes against
idolatry, ver. 26. ( Stand up, (he forbids Religious kneeling) for I my self
also a man) The very Argument that Paul and Barnabas uses, Act. 14. ^er. 15.
We also are men etc. and used against the idolatry of Lystra, expressly
condemned in that place: And the Angels Argument against the idolatry of John,
Rev. 19. 10. I am thy fellow servant, Worship God; Ergo, external Religious
bowing should not be given to any, save to God. 2. Peter and the Angel should
have opened the Jesuits and Formalists distinction, if worshipping of Saints
and dumb images be worshipping of God, and the honor principally of inward
acknowledgment of the Supremacy and Sovereignty of God, be intended, in bowing
to images, and modesty should not forbid honoring of God: And whereas Ioannes
de Lugo Joannes de Lugo, ibid.
says, John was forbidden to Worship the Angel, to signify that our nature in
Christ was advanced to a dignity above the Angels. But 1. then it is unlawful
to any to worship Angels. 2. Nor is it Lawful to give the Virgin Mary Divine
worship, as Suarez says: 1. For her excellency in touching Christ. 2. For her
Grace and Sanctity. 3. For her mothers place in bearing Christ; because her
nature in Christ is not exalted above the nature of other believers, for the
nature common to all believers, and Eadem specie, was assumed by Christ. 3. The
Angel says, ( Worship God) he therefore believed the Worshipping of Angels was
not the Worshipping of God. All these fight against Religious bowing before the
elements, in due regard of so Divine mysteries: the Bread would say (if it
could speak) See thou do it not, for I also am a Creature.

The fifth trick of wit, is a distinction of Suarez, part. 3. to. 1. disp. 54.
Sect. 3. Actus [Adorandi] respectu prototypi est proprie Latreia etc. Respectu
vero imaginis est inferior Veneratio.
Suarez, That one 5. Distin.
and the same act of Adoration may be given, and is given in external Worship
to the image and to God, but in reference to God, it is Latreia, the high
Honoring of God, and in reference to the image, it is an inferior Veneration:
So do our Formalists say, as Burges, Lawfulnes of kneeling cap. 8. p. 14, 15.
Burges says* Adoration and Veneration differ not but by men's will; and if it
be lawful to Adore God before the Ark, p. 34, 35.
Why not at the Sacrament? The Bread and the Wine are Christ significative, (as
the Ark had the title of Jehovah) by occasion of the elements, not as they are,
but as they signify; we may tender a knee-worship, not at all to them, but only
to God or Christ. And again, p. 84, 85.
he holds it lawful to Adore the elements, but then Adoration as given to
the elements, is Veneration, and Adoration in a large sense, 1 Chronicles. 29. 20.
The people Worshipped God and the King: The outward Adoration was one, as the
word by which it is expressed was one; but the Religious and Civil worship
were distinct in the mind and intention of the worshippers. Edward, the 6.
Book Edward, 6. book of Engl. serve. rubr. 5.
says, Kneeling is to eschew profaning of the Sacrament. Opposite to
profaning is external Religious honoring, expressed by kneeling, and that is
Adoring. Hence one and that same Adoration and external bowing, is given to
Bread and to Christ; but the mind and will of the Adorer makes the same act
in reference to Christ, Adoration, or Latreia, of the highest degree of honor;
but in reference to the Bread, lawful Veneration of an inferior nature. Answer
1. If it were possible that the Wise could transmit her body in the act of
Harlotry, by, or through a strange Lover to her Husband, her will and mind
might change Adultery; if she says, she gives her body to a stranger, but in
her mind and will intends to bring forth children to her own Husband: So if
diverse acts of the mind, make Religious kneeling to a stock or Bread lawful,
if one should Adore the man Judas as a memorial of Christ, his intention of
will might save his Soul; if he say, I give one and the same external worship
to Judas and to Christ: Or if Cornelius should say, I give one and the same
knee* worship, to Peter and to Christ; but in my intention they be far
different: For I Worship Judas and Peter in that act with Civil homage
Commanded in the fifth Commandment, as they be Christ's Apostles, and represent
him; but in that same I Worship Christ with the highest honor, called Latreia:
Vasquez and Burges make them one external Worship. The three Children might
have kneeled to the Image of Nebuchadnezzer, for their mind and will (as
Formalists say) might have put another signification of honoring the Lord
Jehovah, upon their knee-worship; and external kneeling could not have been
denied to the Lord Jehovah; and so the three Children should not have given
Divine honor and kneeglory to the Image, and they were fools who did hazard
their bodies to the fire: But wisemen think, if they had given knee-worship
(what ever their heart thought) they should have obeyed the King, yet they
profess disobedience, Dan. 3. 18. We will not worship thy graven image. 2.
Neither think we the Athenians gave that same honor to the similitude Act. 17.
29. of God, that they gave to the God that Paul Preached, who made Heaven and
earth, v. 23, 24. Yet in giving Worship external to both, they were Idolaters,
ver. 29. Nor did the men of Lystra give the same heart-honour to the Deities of
Jupiter and Mercury, which they gave to the shapes of men; yet are they
Idolaters in that. 3. Mr. Burges says, Israel 1 Chronicles. 29. 20. in one and the
same act (external) Worshipped God and the King, because one and the same word
expresses honor both to God and the King. But how shall we call that act?
Civil, or Religious, or mixed? and did they transmit Latreia, divine honor
through the King to God? he has a Metaphysicall faith who believes such
dreams, because one word is used to express both the worshipping of God and
the King, therefore it was one external act of worshipping, and differenced in
the mind and intention of the worshippers; the consequence is most weak, 1 Samuel 12. 18. All the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel, Prove. 24. 21.
My son, fear the Lord and the King, is it one manner of fear really, that is
both religious to God, and to Samuel, and to the Lord, and the King* because
one word expresses both? I see not but one and the same action of bowing may
be made to God, to Christ, to the water in Baptism, to the Bible, to the Sun
and Moon, and we might kneel and Adore a Toad, a straw, and Satan, as they
represent Gods wisdom and power, and through that same external knee-worship
also Adore God: What, may we not then Religiously Adore all things and
Creatures, as they represent God the first being.

Presentemque refert quaelibet herba Deum. A man may Adore himself, his own
hands, his legs, his Mothers Womb that bare him, etc.

As for Adoring of the Ark and footstool of God: 1. Joan. Joan. Giseniue in
^uo Patisi^o, disp. 25, n. 40.
Gisenius, a Lutheran says, The Jews had precept and promise to Worship God
before the Ark, we have no Command to tie external Adoration to any place or
Creature. 2. Didocl. in Altari damasc. Hospinianus de originc festorum

Didoclavius says, It is lawful to Adore God before the Ark, and the Symboles
of his immediate presence, because God is there to receive his own Worship
himself, by an immediate indwelling presence: For says Weames 3. Volumn of the
Ceremon. Law, Cap. 3. page 12.
Mr. Weames, He appeared in glory above the Ark, betwixt the Cherubims, and it

was a type of Christ who dwelled in our flesh; but it is not lavvfull to
Worship him, before the Symboles of his grace. 3. The Ark was a type in the act
of teaching, we grant; but that it was in the act of Adoring, God who was
immediately present, and a Symboll Vicegerent of God, we read not. There is no
need of mediate signs, where God is immediately present, and Adored as he was
in the Ark; they were to fix both senses and thoughts immediately upon God. 4.
They were to worship, not the Ark, but the precept is, and incurvate vos
scabello, Worship tovvard the Ark. Arias Montanus. (...).
Arias Mont. turns it, Worship to the Ark: The Greek Fathers of the second
Nicen. Council, ignorant of the Hebrew Tongue, would have the Lord Commanding
to Adore his footstool; whereas the Particle ((...)) is a note of the Dative
case, and often it signifies motion to a thing, or at a place, (...) ad
dextram, and does not absolutely signify the accusative case. Musculus.

makes it well to signify the measure of bowing, bow to the footstool, or
ground, or pavement of the Temple where the Lords feet are, as he sat on the
Cherubims, 1 Chronicles. 28. 1. For there is no ground for Adoring the Ark; but the
words are to be read, Exalt the Lord our God, and bow your selves, (to wit, to
Jehovah, who shows himself, or dwells at his footstool) that is, betwixt
the Cherubims, 2 Samuel 6. 1. For the word (...) at his footstool, is not
constructed with the Verb, (...) incurvate vos: Jesuits and Formalists, devised
that construction, but it is to be constructed with the word, (...) which is to
be repeated from the former part of the verse, Bow your selves to Jehovah who
dwells in the Ark, or in the Temple: A familiar eleipsis to the Hebrews,
Psalm. 5. 8. I will bow my self (to the Jehovah dwelling) in the Temple of thy
holiness, as we are taught, Our Father which art in Heaven: So (...) and it is
a description of God from the place where he dwelt, and exhibited his presence
to his rude people. 4. It is ignorance in Burges to prove God may be Adored in
the elements, because they are as excellent Symbols of Gods presence as the
Ark: for created excellency is no ground of Adoring the elements, except it be
a Godhead, and uncreated excellency: We condemn Pope Gratian de conser. did.
1. cap. 68. Prayer may as lawfully be given to the Creature as Adoration. There
is a Prayer made to the image of the face of Jesus written in linen, Salve
Sancta facies nostri redemptoris salve vultus domini imago beata, -- nos deduc
ad propria ^ felix figura, ad videndum faciem qua est Christi pura.
Anastasius, who directs Reverend bowing at the hearing of the Gospel, and
not of the Epistles, as if the Gospel were holier then the Epistles.

But if Adoration may be given to the elements, because kneeworship signifies
according to humane institution, and man's will, and are taken from customs of
men, and so does signify less honor then is due to God: Let me be resolved
of this doubt, words of Prayer signify according to men's institution and their
will, no less then Religious gestures do, and we may say to a stock, ( Thou
art my Father) and it is in our will that ( Father) signify a representative
Father, not an infinite and Independent Father, such as God only is.

And if the image in external kneeling, be Adored Per aliud, or co-adored with
the Samplar, because it is one with the Samplar; Why may we not pray to the
image, and fix our faith and hope on the image and elements by co-adoration,
or in relative praying and trusting in them? Yet Concilium Tridentinum
Sessione, 25.
the Fathers of Trent for shame deny that we should pray to images, and put our
trust in them: yet do Formalists turn the enunciative words of Christ ( This is
my body) in an optative mood, and a Prayer, The body and blood of Christ (they
mean the elements in their hands) preserve thee to eternal life: And we are
not ignorant, that faith and hope are ascribed to the Cross, and this sung in
the Church of Rome:

O crux ave spes unica,
Hoc passion is tempore,
Auge pi^^ justitiam,
Reisque dona veniam.
A Learned Papist, Raphael de la Torres in 22. q. 95 art 2. disp. 6. dub. 5.
Eusebius, lib. 3. De praeparat. Evang. teaches us, that Rudiores tantum ad
ligna and lapides recipient, sapientes autem (Gentiles) voluerunt Deum and dci
virtutes sensibus nostris per imagines nobis familiariter deferri. They made
Images books of God. Athanasius in orat. contr. idolat. Dieunt Philosophi
statuas quidem non essedcos, sed simulacbra deorum, ideo baberi ut dys sub
istis imaginibus respondeant.
Raphael de la Torres says plainly, It is lawful to pray to images, so the
inward devotion be directed to God: But if the Jews in their Idolatrous worship
acknoweledged the image to be but a representation of God, and a Book, Jer. 10.
8. They did no wrong who said Ier. 2. ver. 27. to a stock, Thou art my father,
and to a stone, Thou have brought me forth: For condition makes all, if they
speak by a figure; for the Papists when they speak to the Cross, and call the
Cross their only hope, the Cross is not better born nor a stock, it is but
timber or dumb wood: Now how does not the dumb wood to which Prayers are
made, as if Christ himself were present, partake of Prayers and Gods honor, in
an inferior and relative way? For the wood stands before him who prays to
it, as God by representation, and as an actual Vicegerent, and tree-deputy of
God and Christ; it is no less worshipful by mouth-worship, by praying to it,
as to the passive object of Adoration, as capable of knee-worship by bowing
down to it; and a distinction may save idolatry in the one, as well as in the
other: And our Formalists bowing Religiously to bread, do not Adore bread, (as
our half Papists say) and so may they pray to bread, and not Adore bread, for
they are as well masters of Grammar, to impose significations at their will
upon words, as they be Lords of gestures and Ceremonies, to cause kneeling
express Veneration to the images, and to elements, and not Divine Adoration.

Here two great Jesuits, Suarez and Vasquez help the matter for Suarez, in 3.
Tho. q. 25. art. 3. disp. 54. Sect. 4.
Suarez says, There be some acts of worship as faith and prayer, which
precisely respect a reasonable and intelligent person, therefore this prayer
(Hail O crux ave.
cross) it is a figurative speech, and a Metonymie, continens pro re contenta;
and the speech is directed to him who was crucified, and therefore a prayer
(says this Idolater) is considered ut petitio, vel ut honor quidam, either as
a petition, and so it is not directed but to God, but as prayer is an honor
expressed in such words and signs, the image also is thought to be honored by
praying to it, as the samplar to wit Christ, is honored; soft words. Answ. 1.
If praying and believing We may pray to Images and the elements in the Supper,
as well as we may kneel to them.
do properly respect a reasonable creature, so does positive honoring which
is esteemed, by the law of nature, praemium virtutis, a reward of virtue; now
virtue moral to be a foundation of honor, is as vainly given to a tree, or a
stock, as faith and prayer, but to speak to any in prayer, and make our
requests known to them may be thought proper only to a reasonable person, who
only can understand our prayer, and in reason answer our necessities, which a
stock cannot do: but secondly, I answer a stock is by Analogy, and as it is
God representatively, as capable of reason to answer, and help us, and pity
us, in respect it can notably well represent the Majesty of God, who can
answer, help, and pity, as our Idolaters teach, as it is capable of
knee-worship, and that honor which is given to God, though in an higher
degree; for the formal reason why Images and elements are capable of
knee-glory, due to him who swears that all knees shall how to him, is,
because they represent God, and not because of themselves they have any
divinity or Godhead in them. Now the same formal reason holds here, for the
cross, stone, tree, or elements that are prayed unto in that religious state,
as they are the object of praying, do represent God, therefore they are also
capable of faith and prayer, glory, as of knee-worship, or knee-glory. 2.
Faith, hope, and charity (as Suarez de tripli. virt. and supr. dis* 51. Sect.
1. page 757.
Suarez says) in so far as they are given to God, for giving of honor to
him as to the supreme Lord, they put on the nature of adoration, and in that
same place he defines adoration to be the exhibition of honor due to any in
the acknowlegement of excellency and submission and service due to him: Now
Suarez reprooveth Durandus and Pic. Mirandula, because they denied that the
Image was adored, but would only have honor given to God, at the naked
presence of the Image, as a memorable sign, but it is certain, as to trust in
God, and to pray to him is incommunicable to the creature, so to adore any in
acknowledgement of supreme excellency is incommunicable to the creature,
therefore either the image is adored with the same knee-worship that is given
to God, and that improperly and by a figure, as Durandus and Mirandula taught
contrary to the mind of Suarez, and idolatrous Jesuits and F^rmalists, or else
prayers may be made to wood and stone, as to God, and that properly and without
a figure; as knee-worship is tendered to wood and stone by Jesuits doctrine,
prope^^y and without a figure. 3. Papists deny that sacrifices may be offered
to Images, yet they burn incense to images; but that is not, says Antonius
Capellus, adversusprimatum Regis, Angliae contrav. 2. Cap. 30.
a Fransciscan Antonius Capellus, a sacrifice, for it is tendered to men, to
dead carions, and to things that are blessed, and requires neither Altar, nor
Priest: It is true, they say so, but burning incense to the brazen Serpent is
condemned as Idolatry, and Altar and Priest is not of the essence of a
sacrifice; but however as sacrificing is a recognition that we hold all we have
of God, and therefore we sacrifice creatures to him, so any adoring of stocks
is an acknowledgement that these stocks or stones are by way of representation,
that God of whom we hold all the creatures: and do not Papists for the honor
of God, make oblations to Ministers, and burn incense to Saints? and why may
not prayers be offered to them also? 4. It is a wild distinction where he faith
that prayers as honor may be tendered to Images, but not prayers as petitions,
whereas the very act of calling upon God in the day of trouble, Psalm. 50. 15.
is an honoring and glorifying God, and praying to God is due to God, as he is
to be believed in, and to be preached amongst men, Romans 10. 14. 15. And so is
he worthy to be glorified as the subject of preaching; then it is a vain thing
to difference betwixt peti^ioning to God, and honoring God, because in that I
petition God, in my necessities, I submit to him as to God, who can answer and
hear prayers: If therefore the Image and the wood be capable of the honor of
praying, it is also capable of the honor of petitioning, so as we may as
properly petition and supplicate the stock, as give to it the glory of
prayers. 5. If Formalists say in the third person, ( the body Sacramental of
the Lord save thee,) they may upon the same ground say, ( O thou Sacramental
body of the Lord save me) for this is a prayer to God, (O that God would save
his people,) no less then this, (O God save thy people,) the variation of
persons in the Grammar, makes not the one to be a prayer, and not the other.
Vasquez Vasquez to. 1 part. 3. q 25. art. 23. disp. 109. cap. 4.
says, There is not alike reason, why praises, prayers, and Sacrifices should
be tendered to Idols, and knee-worship and Adoration, because from the affection
of Adoring the samplar, there is derived an external note of submission to the
image, which by a common name is called the honor, Worship and Adoration
tendered to the image in a bodily manner, and being done before the image,
tends to the honoring of the samplar; but the outward action of Praising,
Praying, Sacrificing, is commonly called Praising, Praying, Sacrificing, in
relation to the Samplar, to wit, God, and no way in relation to the image, or
to things without life; neither are they by accident referred to the images,
only they be tendered to God before images, Coram illis. But I Answer, This is
but to beg the Question, for we deny, that from Adoring the image, there
resulteth any Adoring of God, but a great dishonouring of his Name. 2.
Durandus, Mirandula, Hulcot, deny that Adoring of God, Coram imaginibus tanquam
signis memorativis, before the images as memorials of God, should be an Adoring
of the images: And Suarez says, If images be only remembrances and memorials
in the act of Adoration, this takes much honor from the images, and is, says
Suarez tom. 1. in 3. q. 25. art. 3. disp. 54. Sect. 5. Si tantum coram
imaginibus Adoratur deus, hoc multum derogat imaginum venerationi, nam ^x eo
non tantum sequitur imagines [clementa Sacramentalia] minus coli, quam
exemplaria, sed etiam sequitur illas non coli omnius, -- sed exemplaria tantum.
he, An Adoring of the Samplar, but not an Adoring of the image: Though
Vasquez, tom. 1. part. 3. q. 25. disp. 108. cap. 14. Nam iconomachi qui ad
solam recordationem imaginibus utuntur, ante illas genu^ a non flectunt nec se

and ipsum spiritu solum adorant.
Vasquez; expounding Gregory's mind, (which superstitious man calls them,
Gregorius Mag. l. 7. Epist. 53. if these be his Epistles.
good books) contradict Suarez in this, yea, and himself also; for he says,
The enemies of images (he means the Reformed Churches) who use them only for
memorials and books, (it is a lie that we use them as books,) will not bow
their knee to them, for then (says he) they should Adore them; and therefore
(says Vasquez,) if Christ be not in very deed, in his presence in the
Sacrament present, the knee-worship is tendered to bread and wine, which is
(says he) Idolatry; therefore either our Formalists are Transubstantiators, or
Idolaters, or both; by this learned Jesuits judgment, and why by this same
reason may we not say against Vasquez ibid. He who adoreth a saint (says
Joan. d^ lugo de myster. inincarnat disp. 36. sect. 3. n. 29.) for friendship
and grace which he has arguitive, by consequence he worshipeth God of whom
the man has grace, yet it is not needful that he formally adore God, and in
recto in so doing for he may honor the saint and not formally honor God, for
the saint and God are two diverse objects. Answ. This proves our point, that
when I adore an Image, intending to adore God, some ^oule-adoration adhereth to
the Image, and that is a taste of Gods proper glory given to a stock, or a
stone.
Vasquez, that the bodily offerings of prayers, praises, and sacrifices to God,
before the Image as the Image, is an honoring of the Image by prayer, they say
to the tree of the Cross.

Auge piis justitiam, reisque dona veniam. Increase righteousness in us, and
give remission of sins, O tree cross to guilty sinners. Names at Rome go as
men will, but the honor it self is put upon the dumb wood, which is due to
Christ. O it is but a figure (say they) yea but (say we) prayers and praises in
a bodily manner, and vocally are tendered to the wood, yet if the wife commit
adultery with her husbands brother, because he represents her husband, I
think the matter should be washen with Ink, and badly excused to say, O the
loving wife for strong love to her husband commits figurative adultery, and
that bodily harlotry is referred to the brother of her husband by accident, and
to her husband kindly, and per se, for himself. The same way, if Formalists
bow their knee to bread, that such a holy mystery be not profaned. We know
they cannot understand civil or country non-prophanation, that they intend;
for kneeling and evil manners at the Lords table do well consist together. Now
religious nonprophanation by knee-worship, is adoring of these mysterious
elements. Ergo they make prayers and sing praises, and offer sacrifices to the
bread, Let them see to this and answer to it if they can. The sixth evasion of
wit, I find in Joan. de lugo. de mist. incar. disp. 36. sect. 3. n. 25, 26, 27.
and seq. Respectus imaginis est quasi materialis and inanimatus, quia sic
ap^rimus caput imagini, ut per illam actionem nihil velimus imagini dicere aut
significare, sed soli exemplari, ad quod dirigitur ille actus pro ut
significativus and prout civilis communicatio; and ideo respectu illius solum
videtur esse actio animata. De Lugo ibid. Hoc enim esset stultum mendacium,
quia absolute loquend^ meliores sumus nos quam Imago sancti Petri. And conform
to this the seventh pretended and bastard Council calls them half holy, and
half true, half false worshipers of God, Antonius Capellus cites it, Advers.
prim. regis Anglia, c. 30. Who will have Images to stand only for memorialls,
but not to be worshipped.
Johannes de Lugo, who says, 1. That the image and samplar making one and the
same object, by aggregation, the inward affection besides external
knee-worship is given to both, but to the Image relatively, and for God or the
samplar, and not for proper divine excellency in it, and therefore the
Councels (says he) call it not adoration in spiritu, but it is tendered to God
absolutely. 2. We give adoration of internal submission to God, or the samplar
as the debt of potestative justice, but we do not so worship the Image, we
have no civil or politic communication with the Image, Council. seventh art.
1. p. 458. Qui vero dicunt su^^icere usum imaginum ad memoriam solum, non vero
ad salutationem ^as habentes illud quidem recipientes, hoc vero re^icien^es,
s^miprobi quadantenus, and falso v^ti [ut ita dicam] deprehenduntur.
because it is not a reasonable creature, and therefore the worship of the
Image is as it were a material and livelesse action; when we uncover our head
to the Image, by that action we would say or signify nothing to the Image, but
to the samplar, or to God only. 3. The inward submission that we tender to the
Image, is not that we submit to it, as to a thing more excellent then we, for
that were a foolish lie; yet (says he) (that the man might fulfill the cup of
the iniquity of his Fathers) we kiss not the Image in recto directly tendering
honor to it, but to God and the samplar before it. 1. Because then I should
adore my own breast when I knock upon it adoring the Eucharist. 2. Because so
I bow to the wall before me. 3. If I have no honorable opinion of the Image, I
do not adore it at all. 4. By kneeling to the Image, I have a will of
submitting externally my affection to the Image, I yield to it* as a thing
above me, giving to it the higher place 4. The act of adoration is simply
terminated upon the Image, as a thing contra distinguished from the samplar,
though it be adored with the same action with which the samplar is adored. Thus
the ^e^uite.

Answ. But here all men may see many contradictions, and that he casts down
all that formerly he has said, ^^. Images even as Answ.
they represent God are dead things, and less then a redeemed Saint, Ergo, I
can give them no submission of external honor. 2. I signify and say nothing
of honor to the Image, even as it respects God, and represents him,
because the dignity of representing God does not elevate it to be a reasonable
creature, therefore I cannot honor it, and it were a foolish lie to say that
the Image as representing God, were a reasonable creature. 3. As it
represents God, it cannot hear payers, nor deliver in trouble, as the Holy
One of Israel can do; Ergo by the Holy Ghosts argument, I cannot bow to a lie,
Esa. 44. 17. and 46. 9. Hab. 2. 19. 20. it made not the heaven and the earth,
but by a figure, because it represents the maker of heaven and earth,
wherefore it should have but figurative honor at the best, and that is no
real honor, Jer. 10. 8, 11, 12, 4. There is no debt of justice due to the
dumb wood, or element, honor of external submission is a debt of potestative
justice due to a superior, the Images and Elements are not my superior. 1.
They be means, I the end. 2. They be void of life and reason which I have. 3.
They are not redeemed, sanctified, and to be glorified as I am. Joan. de Lugo
answers, As I may love Peter for the goodness that is not in Peter but in
another, as I may love and desire good to Peter, for the goodness that is in
his father, and not in himself, and so pay the debt of affection to him for
another, so I may honor an Image for the debt of honor that I owe to the
samplar represented by the Image, therefore it is not required to the essence
of adoration, that we acknowledge debt due to every thing adored for another;
it is sufficient a debt be acknowledged, either to the Image, or the samplar.
Answ. The debt of love and the debt of honor are not alike. I owe honor to
superiors only as superiors, I owe love to superiors, equals, inferiors.
If I truly adore an Image, I truly acknowledge excellency in the Image, I truly
yield to it, a worthier place then I deserve to have my self, (says De Lugo
ibid. 39. imagi^s vere cedo exterius, daudo illi meliore^ and superiorem lo^um
honorifice eam tracta^do.
de Lugo) Ergo, by the fifth Commandment according to the debt of justice, I
owe fear, honor, and reverence to it, else I adore it by a figure, which the
Jesuit does deny.

opinion of adoration. In the second Nicene Council, an obscure age, (says
Pet. Molin^us Buckler of Faith of Images, Sect. 118. page 308.
Petrus Molinaeus) when the scriptures were taken away, it is ordained that
Images should be adored, but not the Images of the Father. Quoniamquis sit non

Image of the Son. This Council was Anno 787. as says Bellarm de scrip. in
Chron.
Bellarmine. But this wicked Fathers argument proves also that the Image of God
the Father may be painted, while they prove worshipping of Images, because the
Psalmist says, The Lord arose as a mighty man after Wine. But Genebrard ^hron.
an. 794. p. 308.
Genebrard says this Council of Nice, was controuled by a Council in the
West. Barronius An. 726. Observe that Aeneas Sylvius epist. 301. says, ante*
Nicenam Synodum unusquisque sibi vivebat, quemadmodum sibi visum est, and
paro^s respectus ad Romanam ecclesiam ^abe^atur, a Metropolitan Bishop, a step
to the Popedom, was first created here in Romes Car^bage, Constantin^ple,
Antiochia.
Barronius mentions two Epistles written by Gregorious 2. a defender of
Images, wherein he says, the Son may be painted, not the Father. This
Council was approved by Constantine, Ireneus, and a Greek copy of the Synod
sent to Pontific.
Adrian the Pope. But 1. this wicked Synod did not maintain adoration of
Images, such as Suarez, Bellarmine, Vasquez, Peri^rius, etc. now hold, but
only veneration. 2. Images were placed in the Churches, says Paulus diaconus
lib. 13.
Paul. Diaconus, multis contra dicentibus, many speaking against i^. And

abrogate the Acts of this Synod, and Synod Franckford.
the Synod of Franckford condemned this Synod. See Aventinus lib. 4.
Aventinus; Hincmarus cap. 20. contra Iandu^^ns^m.
Hincmarus says it is true they of Franckford allowed Images to be in
Churches, but not to be adored. Vrspergens. in Histor.
Vrspergensis says that this synod did write a book against the second
Council of Nice, called otherwise the seventh general Council. A book came
out* in France, and after in Germany under the name of Charles the Great,
condemning by strong reasons the adoration of Images, and answers all the
arguments of the Nicene Fathers on the contrary, Tannerus the Jesuit says
this was a forged Book. But against famous and learned Authors saying the
contrary, and so Hincmarin. Archiepiscopus Remorum c. 10. cont. Hincmarin.

Hincmarius and Eccius in E^chirid.
Ectius make mention of this book, and Pope Adrianus (as Hospin. d^ orig. imag.
p 197.
Hospinianus does well observe) does approve of this Synod of Francford by his
Letters written to the Emperor of Constantinople, and the Patriarch Tharasius.

The first five hundred years (says Calvin. justit. lib. 1. cap. 11. Sect. 13.
Calvin) images were not worshipped. Caj^s Caligula a proud Tyrant, commanded
the Jews to set up his image in the Temple: the Jews answered they should
rather die then pollute the Temple of God with images, as ^aith Josephus antiq
lib. 18. cap. 11.
Josephus and Euse^. bistor. lib. 2. cap. 6.
Eusebius, and this fell out while the Apostles lived.

Christians were men of good conversation, and detested vices, worshipped
Christ, and would not worship Images Epist. Plinii. 2 ad Imporat Trajan.
, as that Letter bears: and Eusebius. Histor. lib. 3. cap. 33.
Eusebius, reports Adrian had a purpose, (as says Bucol^. in Alexand. severo.
Bucol.) to build a Church for the honor of Christ void of Images. See Symson

Tertullian, a most ancient writer, who lived under Severus in time of the
fifth Persecution, as Magdeburgens. cent. 3. cap. 10.
the Magdeburgenses testify; says, Nos adoramus oculis ad caelum sublatis,
non adimagines seu picturas, and, indignum ut imago Dei vivi imagini idoli, and
mortu: fiat similis, (says Apol. 1. 9. 11.
he also) and not only thinks it unlawful to represent God by an Image, but
also says, that Craftsmen, who profess themselves Christians, ought no^ to
make Images of God. An ancient Writer Clemens Alexand. in Paraenetico.
Clemens Alexandrinus, Non est nobis imago sensibilis de materia sensibili,
nisi quae precipitur intelligentia. Deus enim qui solus est vere Deas,
intelligentia precipitur, non sensu: We have no sensible Image of sensible
matter, because God is taken up by the understanding, not by the sense: and in

Hospinian says Ann, 200. and Iren^us, l. 1. cap. 24.
Ireneus, the disciple of Polycarpus, an hearer of John the Apostle makes it
the Heresy of the Gnostics, that they held that Pilate made the Image of
Jesus: Et quod imagines baberent Christi, Apostolorum atque Philosophorum*

Cyprian says, Idols, or Images, be not only against the Law of God, but
against the nature of man; Origin. cont. cel. sum. l. 8.
Origin said, The Images of Christians are Christians indeed, with Gods Image:
and, Nos veno ideo non honor amus simulachra, quia quantu^ possumus, cavemnus,

Athanas. advers. gentes.
Grave Athanasius says, (...) The invention of Images is from an evil
fountain, and not from good, and whatsoever has a bad beginning, cannot be
deemed in any thing good, being altogether bad: The Papist Harding brings in
a counterfeit Dialogue of Athanasius, betwixt Christ and his Church; and Christ
comforting his Church, because she was persecuted for worshipping Christ's
Image; but when and where this persecution was, none knows, for many times
has the Church been persecured for not worshipping Images; but see the answer

not God, and therefore is not to be adored: He professes that he did rive a
vail, that had painted in it the Image of Christ, or of some man* Cum ego
videssem in Ecclesia Christi* contra authoritatem scripturarum, hominis pendere
imaginem, scidi illud, etc.

Lactantius Formianus, Images are to represent these who are absent. God is
every where present, it is vanity therefore to form an image of God. Also
Lactantius lib. 2. cap. 19.
There is no Religion, where there is an image: Also Ib. Cur ad parietes and
signa, and lapides potissimum quam illo spectatis, ubi cos esse credatis. ib.
instit. div. l. 2. c. 1.
your gods be either in Heaven, or not; if they be not in Heaven, why do ye
worship them? If they be in Heaven, why do ye not lift your eyes to Heaven
while you adore them? Why do you convert your eyes toward walls, stocks and
stones, rather then toward that place where you imagine your gods to be?

Churches, nor Images to be ornaments in their Churches, as says ( t)
Ambrosius, and also Chrysostom. l. 2. epist. 246.

says, They were not like the Templ^s of the Apostolic Churches: and

Tertullian himself makes building of Altars, and portracts, Idol^tricos
cultus, Idolatrous worship. In the forty years space, betwixt the reign of
Valerian, and the 19. year of Dicclesian, there were Oratories and Temples
builded, but neither painted Pictures, nor Images in them, as says [ e]
Eusebius: Yea, of thirty Bishops of Rome, even from Peter and Paul to
Sylvester, and Constantine the Emperor; to wit, three hundred years, there
were none, who were not persecuted to blood, or to death, or some other way. It
is a vain thing to say, they had breathing time to build (f) Eusebius. Hist.

Temples, and erect Altars, and golden Images of Christ, and the Virgin Mary,
and the Saints. It is true, in the two hundredth year after Christ, under
Alexander Severus, Gordianus, Philippus, Gallienus; Churches were builded, as
Nicephorus l. 7. c. 2.
Nicephorus says, but again under Dioclesian they were demolished to the
ground, but observe well there were no Images of Christ broken, which that
Tyrant in despite of Christ, would not have omitted; see Eusebius. l. 8. c. 2.

donation of Constantine, with twelve portions of earth, equal to the number of
the twelve Apostles, and of another Church, with the title of the holy Cross
at Jerusalem, which Helena found in that place, and Constantine placed in this
Church at Rome, is refuted by Hospinian d^ Orig. Templo cap. 6. page 34.
Hospinian: yet is there no word of any Images in these Churches.

Arnob. cont. gent. lib. 2.
Arnobius An. 330. maintains against the heathen, that the Christians ought
to have no Images: 1. Because the device of images is a novelty, and was not
before two thousand years, but God and Religion are no new things. 2. Ib. lib.
6. and lib. 7.
Because either the Gods dwells in their images, against their will, or of
their own accord; if the former be said, they are compelled, which is absurd.
If the latter, then they do either bide always in their images, and so are
miserable, or they go out of the images when they please, and then the images
are empty things.

Eusebius. Caesariens. Epist. ad Constantiam Augustam.
Eusebius Caesariensis who lived, An. 300. when Constantia Augusta wrote to him
for the Image of Christ, answered.

That could not be: 1. Because his manhood was joined with his Godhead, and
could not be separated therefrom. 2. Because his Godhead cannot be represented,
Mortuis, and inanimatis coloribus, with dead and livelesse colors. Hycron.

antiquity says not, that she adored the nails that fixed him to the Cross,
because they were but creatures.

Ambro. in cap. 1. epist. ad Romans
Ambrosius, who lived, Anno 370. condemns Images. 1. Because they change the
images of the dead, in the glory of God, who worshippeth images: 2. The living

them, what they are not. 4. Ambros. offices l. 1. c. 26.

Damascen de Imagine. orat. 2.
Cyrillus Alexandrin. who lived An. 415. says, We neither believe the martyrs
to be gods, nor do we adore them.

Gregor. lin. 9. ep. 9. Perlatum est ad nos, quod inconsider^to zelo succensus
sanctorum magines sub bac, quasi excusatione, ne adorari debuissent,
confregeris, and quidem, quia cas adorari, vet^isses omnino laudamus, fregisse

Damascen a superstitious man much for Images acknowledges two things. 1. That
Images are but (...) unwritten traditions. 2. He ackowledgeth that the brazen
Serpent, the Cherubims were made for signification, not for imitation or
adoration.

(i)Gregorius Magnus, though he be alleged by Papists for adoration of Images.
Yet in his Epistle to Serenus Bishop of Massilia, An. 600. he forbids the
adoration of Images, and allows only the Historical use of them, as is
observed by Fran. Whites way to the Church, chapter 9, sect. 2. p. 114.

by Hospinian and Catol. test. veritat l. 6. p. 562.

this man being the first who brought Images into the Church has this Caveat,
atque indica (says he to Sirenus) quod non tibi, ipsa visio historiae quae,
pictura test, pandebatur, displicueri^: sed illa adoratio quae picturis fuerit
in competenter exhibita, and si quis imagines facere voluerit, minime prohibe,
adorare vero imagines omnibus modis divita, sed hoc solicit admoneas, ut ex
visione rei gestae, ardorem conjunctionis percipiant, and in adoratione solius
Trinitatis prosternantur. It is clear that this man teaches an adoration of
Images, though he make them only books to the rude. This same Greg mag. lib.
3. dialo.
Gregorius will have the sign of the cross adored, because when the Devil
came to a Jew sleeping in the night in the Temple of an Idol, the Jew being
afraid, signed himself with the Cross, and the Devil fled; but when does
Jews come in any Christian Churches, or Idoll-Temples, who abhor the name of
Christ, and so hate both the Cross and Christ, and what can be proved from a
fact of Satan?

In the eighth age, Beda l. 2. c. 21. ad peragenda nostrae salutis mysteria

Hulcot who lived an. 1346. says Latreia, divine worship belongs to God

Peresius Ajala a Popish Bishop, for adoration of Images, says he, there is
neither Scripture, nor Church tradition, nor consent of Fathers, nor good
reason to make it good. For says Gabriel Biel in Can. lec. 49.
Gabriel Biel, The image either considered in it self as it is metal or
stone, or as it is a holy sign, is a sensible Creature, to which Latreia,
Divine honor should not be given: and the Romish D^cret. 3. did. 3. c. 27.

Images of God and Christ which can see, and hear, and speak, we exceedingly
desire to know: Alexand. Alens. 3. p. q. 30. art. ult.

Worshipping images had been suppressed. The Council convened by Council.
Constantin^polit. An. 755. of 338. Bishops. Yea, this same second council of
Nice, and the seventh Epistle to the Synod, condemns Nestorius of Idolatry,
and condemns the Arians as Idolaters, who Worshipped Christ whom they
believed to be a man only: And Athanasius, contr. Arian. Orati. 1. And
Nyssenus in Laud. Bas. And Nazianzen, Orati. 40. say. To Adore a Creature,
though in the Name of Christ or God, is Idolatry.
Constantius Capronimus condemns Worshipping of Images, or placing them in
Churches. 1. Because it is forbidden in the second Commandment. 2. The
Picturing of Christ is a dividing of the two Natures. 3. It is against the
Ancients, Epiphanius, Nazianzen, Chrysostom, Athanasius, Amphylocius,
Theodorus, Eusebius Pamphili. The Council of Nice is builded upon lies. Adrian
Bishiop of Rome, writes to the Council of Nice, That the Emperor Constantine
being a Leaper, and laboring to cure his Leprosy by shedding of innocent
Babes blood; Peter and Paul appeared to him by night, in a Vision, and bade him
go to be Baptized by Sylvester, and that he, to be cured by Sylvesters
Baptizing, builded a Temple with the Images of Peter and Paul. This is as true
as the Image of Christ spoke to Tho: Aquinas at Naples, Been Scripsistti de me,
Thoma, Why is not all Evangell that Aquinas has written then? For their own
Platina Platina in vita Marci. Papae.
says, The story of Constantines Leprosy is a fable; and Socrates says, That
Constantine was sick when he was 65. years, and he makes no mention of his
leprosy; so Hospin. de orig. perogimatio. page 381.
Hospinianus says, and our own Symson, Treatise of Images, p. 47.
Simson says, That Sylvester and Marcus his successor were both dead before
Constantine was Baptized: Genebrad. in Chron. l. 2. Anno 1794.
Genebradus a Papist says, down right, that the Council of Frankford
condemned the second Nicene Council; But Bellarm. de Imag. l. 2 c. 14.

Alanus, deny that the Doctrine of the second Nicene Council for Adoring

Annonius is most clear in it, and Abbot Vspergens. in Chron. Anno 793.

the Book of Charles the Great says the same. The Synod of Frankford was
convened An. 794. of purpose to condemn the second Synod of Nice, called the
seventh pretended and false Synod: Aventinus, lib. 4. annal.
Aventinus says expressly, Scita Grecorum (in Synodo Nicena decreta) de
imaginibus adorandis in concili^ francofurtensi rescissa and abolita sunt: and
Vspergens. in Chron. Anno 793.
Vspergensis says, in this Synod it was decreed, Vt septima and universalis
Synodus, nec septima nec aliquid diceretur, quasi supervacua ab omnibus abdica
tu est; and the same says Eginradus in vita Caroli Magni.
Eginradus, Cassander in Consul. ad ferdinand. and Maxmilian imp.
Geo^ Cassander: But the very Arguments in the Nicene Council are set down,
and dissolved in the Frankford Council, as our own Master Simson, Treatise of
Images, page 48.
Simson observes: As the Nicene Council reasons from the Cherubims, and the
brazen Serpent. Frankfoord Answers, These were made at Gods Commandment,
images not so. 2. Yea, say they, and with them Lorinus in Art. 17. ver. 25.
Serpentem. Conflari^jusfit non quod adorari vellet, nam postea confregit.
Lorinus, The Cherubims and brazen Serpent were not made to be Worshipped; see
these and many other Arguments, set down and Answered by the Council of
Frankfoord: As also says Catol. Test. Verit. lib. 8. page 882, 883, 884.
the Learned Author of Catol. Test. Verit. The Arguments used by this Council,
proves that no Adoration is due to Images, as may be hence collected: As also
out of the book of Caroli. lib. 1. cap. 2.
Charles against the dreams of Tarasius, whose entry to the Priesthood was
unlawful, and was a gross Idolater, and against the Idolater Pope Adrian;
Because 1. There is no holiness in images, either as they are figures or
colors, or as they are Consecrated. 2. Because to Adore is to glorify, Carlo.
lib. 1. c. 21.
but only God is to be glorified. 3. God Commandedus not to love images, but
men, and sent his son in the flesh for men, and not for images; and if Caro.
lib. 2. cap. 24. Caro. lib. 3. cap. 16.
they be not to be believed on, neither are they to be Adored. 4. It cannot be
proved that the honor of the image, is the honor of the Samplar: Christ said
not, What ye do to images, ye do to me, nor he that receives images, receives
me. This Argument proves, that Veneration is not due to the Images, as to
books of the Trinity; because that the Veneration of the Image, is an honoring
of God, there must be an union betwixt the Images and God or Christ, betwixt
the Tree and Christ. 1. There is no union lawful, that can be a Warrant of
honoring any thing; but an union Warranted of God, betwixt Crossing in the
Air, and Dedication to Christ's Service, betwixt Surplice and Pastoral
Sanctity; There is no union, nor is there a personal union betwixt Christ and
the Image: Nor 2. an union of parts, as betwixt the shoulders and the head. Nor
3. is there a Divine relative union, as betwixt the mean or the end, the
Servant or the Lord: for as White against Fisher, p. 224.
John White says well; and Matthew. 10. 14, 42. 2 Cor. 8. 4. Gal. 4. 14. Act.
10. 34. Ps. 119. 97. 159. 147. 82. 103. 111. 113. 114. 120. 127. 128. 140. 143.
167. 174.
the Scripture proves, all union betwixt God and the means of Worship, which
are to be reverenced as means of Worship in relation to God, is by divine
institution; now certainly if by divine ordination there had been an union
betwixt the Image and God, then had it been lawful to lay the Image in the
heart, to say: How love I thy Image? (the painted pictures and wooden portracts
of Christ, the wood of the Cross are my delight) (I hope in the wood) (I have
taken images for my heritage, they are sweeter to me, nor the honey or the

Suarez, make this a principle of their Bible of Idol worship; That God and
the Image are one, but we see not how they be one, nor can we say that God is
present in the Image as in a place: for if he be present in the Image, In loco
ut sic, as in such a place, then he is there as in a consecrated place, and by
promise, and so they must give us the word of God, for Gods presence in Images;
but if God be present in Images, as In loco simpliciter, non ut in loco ut sic:

Professor Joan. de Lugo de myster. incarnat. disp. 37. Sect. 1. n. 1. 2, 3.
Joannes de Lugo proves by four great reasons, that all creatures should be
adored.

1. Because all creatures are the effects, and as it were the hand writing of
God.

2. Because we use to kiss and adore material places, and the stone, or field
where an Angel, or Saint has been, for the touching and propinquity of the
place and that holy thing, but Gods omnipresence sanctifies all creatures. Be
doing then, Masters, kiss, and adore the sanctified Devil and Hell fire, but
take heed you scald not your lips.

3. We kiss and worship a gift of a Prince, but all creatures, even the most
abject and contemptible, are the gifts of God the Creator.

4. Man in a special manner is the living image of God. But true it is, God is
to be praised for all his creatures; but external Adoration before them, and
laying a part of Gods glory upon them, for that is forbidden by your own, for
Leo. 1. Sermon. 7. De nativita abstinendum ab ipsa specic offi^ij.

But I return to the Synod of Franckeford: 5. Carol. lib. 2. cap. 25.
Because images are void of senses and reason. 6. It cannot be proved by the
example of the Apostles, Ibid.
Ergo, (say I) Images are neither to be teaching books, nor adored creatures:
7. The ancient Fathers Carol. l. 4. cap. 27.
were ignorant of this worship. 8* Only the rich Carol. l. 4. cap. 27.
who are able to sustain Images, should be saved, and not the poor. 9. There

is no profit, but great vanity in adoring Images.

God wrought miracles. Gregorius Nyssenus bowed his knee to the Image of
Abraham: What then? the Council says, these books of Nyssenus are perished.

The fable of Agbarus, to whom the Image of Christ's face painted in a cloth
was sent, was not in the world till the year of God, 700. It is a counterfeit
work ascribed to Athanasius, in style and phrase of writing not like to him,
where it is said, that it was the image of Christ crucified by the Jews in
Berythus a Town in Syria, out of whose side flowed blood and water, which being
mixed with water, could cure all diseases; Symson treats of the worshipping of
Images, page 50, 51.

Surjus and your own men say, this Council condemns images. For 370. years
there were no Images in Churches; in this age Martyrs were admired, and the
Grecians first, especially Gregorius Nyssenus the brother of Basilus had Images
in Churches; Sozomen l. 5. c. 20.
Sozomen says, Christians took into Churches pieces of Christ's image, broken
by Julian the Apostat, in the first age, when Religion was born down and holy
Pastors killed.

Gregorius Magnus first defended that images should be in Churches. Its like
the Apostate Julian would hate any thing, bearing the name of Christ most
falsely, yea, and Antiquity bears contradictions most aparent touching images.

But Nicephor hist. l. 11. cap. 43.
Nicephorus says, the creatures of God are the Lawful Images of God. But it
is more then evident, by what I have said, that ancient Papists and Synods used
images to be memorials of God, and not to be adored.

CAP. II.
QUEST. 1.
Whither kneeling or sitting be the most convenient and Lawful gesture in the
Act of receiving the Sacrament of Christ's Body and blood?

1. Conclus. SItting is the most and only lawful gesture, That gesture, that
Christ and his Disciples used upon moral and unalterable grounds, which does
not concern the first Supper as first, but as a Supper, and that not upon no
occasional and temporary reasons, belonging to that Supper, more then to all
the Suppers of that kind, that we are to follow as a pattern, and must be most
Lawful. But the gesture of sitting is such, Ergo:

The Proposition is evident in Scripture, Prove. 2. ^0. Ephesians. 5. 1. ^ These. 1.
16. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 6, 7. ^ Cor. ^^. Phil. 3. 17. 2. Tim. 3. 4. Sitting the only
convenient gesture.
.

I prove the Assumption. 1. Sitting was either: 1. Miraculous. 2. Customable.
3. Occasional; or 4. Moral. None in reason can say the first; that sitting
was a miracle: 2. Nor is it customable. For 1. Customs laudable are grounded
upon decency and reason, and so moral, or grounded upon no reason at all.

But Christ did nothing in Gods worship, nor did he any humane moral actions
for the mere fact and will of others going before, for these were not
reasonable humane actions, and if it be customable only, it is not lawful to
put away a customable action out of worship, and to put a moral action of
kneeling and Divine signification in the place thereof, for so we might change
places, times, persons and all physical circumstances, and make them
supernatural. 2. The action could not be occasional: for then the occasion of
the Supper as first, and because of such persons, such time at night, such
place, an upper chamber, should have moved Christ to sitting, rather then to
kneeling, or to any other gesture; but kneeling or any other gesture might have
consisted well with that first Supper, with the upper chamber, with the time
and persons, as well as sitting, except the Law givers will had been a reason
of the contrary.

Some object. Christ choosed an upper chamber, not the Temple, twelve persons,
not ten, not twenty, at night, for he might have celebrated it at dinner, but
we are not holden to imitate Christ in these; Ergo, neither in sitting.

Ans. Occasional, properly is that which has a reason, not from What is
occasional in the first supper.
the nature of the thing it self, but from such occasional occurrences of
Providence, as God will not alter, and its that which has no moral nor sacred
convenience with the nature of worship, but has only a convenience for such a
time and place, as Christ's preaching in a ship, when he is at the sea side, and
a multitude are to hear him, the ship has no agreement with the nature of
preaching, more then an house has, time, place, and persons are clearly such
as agreed with that supper, as first, not as a sacred worship, and therefore
were merely occasional, and so not imitable, and though Christ might have
altered them, yet had they been occasional, and they have no sacred
convenience with this Supper, as this Supper; and if Christ had altered these
for mere will, upon no reasons that concerns all Suppers, they had not been
occasional, but positive points of worship, and so had obliged us; yea, the
upper chamber, and these twelve persons by no possibility, can concern all
Suppers, to the end of the world, but sitting agrees kindly and natively to
all Suppers in general, as kneeling to all praying indefinitely. Christ might
have changed bread and wine, in flesh, and milk, or water, will it hence
follow, we are not to imitate Christ in bread and wine? And that bread and wine
are occasional? Lastly, Paul's practice in passing from an upper chamber, and
from twelve men, to a Church full of men and women, 1 Cor. 11. 23, 17, 18, 22.
warranteth us to pass from these, we have not the like reason to warrant us to
pass from sitting.

2. That gesture which Christ choosed, and that refusing all other, 2. Arg.
even kneeling, having the same Religious reasons, at the first supper as now,
that must be most convenient and lawful. But sitting is such; Ergo,

The Proposition is clear: The Assumption is proved from Matthew. 26. While they
did eat (the Passover) he took bread, Mar. 14* 22. As Christ sat at the first
Supper.
they did eat, Jesus took bread.

But while they did eat the Passover, they sat. Ergo, while they took the
Supper they sat: I prove the Assumption, Matthew. 26. 20. And, when the evening
was come, he sat down with the twelve, Mark 14. 18. And as they sat, and did
eat, Jesus said, etc. v. 22. And as they did eat, Jesus took bread* eating the
Passover, and sitting were co-existent, and taking the Sacramental bread of
the Supper, and eating the Passover were co-existent; Ergo, Taking the bread
of the Supper, and sitting were co-existent.

Paybodie says, Paul expounds, ( as they did eat) after they had Of
kneeling, part. 2. page ^^*
ended eating, and so after they had ended sitting, and possibly passed to
another gesture, 1 Cor. 11. After Supper he took the Cup. Ans. If you wholly
remove the Passover, you remove the Table also. 2. Though the Suppers were not
mingled, yet the holy Ghost expresses the co-existence of sitting, and taking
the Sacramental bread, as Ezech. 8. 1. As I sat in mine house, the hand of
Jehovah fell upon me, 2 Samuel 18 14. Ioab thrust three darts in him, while he
was yet alive, 1 Samuel 25. 16. The men were a wall to us, all the time that
we were with them, Dan. 4. 3. and Matthew. 26. 47. And while he yet spoke,
Lo, Judas came, Act. 10. 19. While Peter thought on the vision, the spirit said
to him, Act. 22. 6. Romans 5. 10. If praying interveened betwixt eating and
taking the Supper, and the Passover sitting, to put them to kneeling, this
must be true, while they were not eating, Christ took bread, a plain
contradicting of Christ. 3. After Supper he took the cup, but they say not
after Supper he took the bread, for praying, blessing, breaking, distributing,
eating, interveened betwixt the Passover and taking the Communion Cup, and
therefore he had reason to say, After Supper he took the Cup, but not that
reason, to say, after Supper he took the Bread. It is violent to describe
Christ's taking the Bread from the adjunct of time, while as they sat and did
eat, if sitting and eating were not at this time, but were gone and past by
many interveening actions of kneeling, praying, preaching, this were to
describe supper from dinner. 3. By this, the gesture of no Table action can be
cleared from Scripture, for when it is said, Luke 9. John 6. He made the
multitude sit down and ^a^^, a cavillator might say, praying and blessing the
meat went before, and possibly they sat on their knees, and Christ sat down
and taught the people; it may be he rose and kneeled before Sermon was ended.
The Scripture says, While Christ and his disciples did ^^^, and so while they
did sit, he took bread. This taking of bread, whether it be an Hysterosis as
many think, in respect the Evangelists mention but once taking of bread, or if
it was preparatorie, and before the act of blessing, it was a sacramental act
performed by Christ, while they were sitting, which is much for sitting.

That Christ passed not from passover sitting, to Supper kneeling, I think
these considerations move me. 1. Because the changes of all in the Passover,
to that in the Lords Supper, as of flesh in bread and wine, is positively set
down. 2. No question the change unto an adoring gesture, had been upon the
grounds of conciliating more reverence to that Sacrament, then to the
Passover, which must be moral, and tie to the end of the world. 3. Nor would
the Holy Ghost have removed an ordinary table gesture into so insolent, and
supernaturally significant gesture, as kneeling, without a grave reason
expressed, or his own will only, which is only the essential reason, why
bread is a Sacrament rather then any other Element, and so would stand of
necessary and essential use. 4. Sitting at the Idols table 1 Cor. 8. 10.
declares that in religious feasts, sitting was ordinary, and a sign indicant
of honoring the spiritual Lord of the Banquet, and a religious communion with
the Lord of the Feast was hence signified.

But says Paybodie (...) and (...) Mat. 26. 20. Mark. Part. 2. Page 62.
14. 18. Luke 22. 14. John ^3. 12. signifies lying, and M. Li^ds^y ^aith, it
signifies prostration on the earth rather then sitting* Por Levit. 18. 23.
standing and lying are confounded, and Calvin expounds it so.

Ans. 1. Christ* his reasoning to prove that (...) to sit at meat is a greater
honor, then to stand: Luke 22. 27. were null, if (...) signify prostration,
for religious bowing is always an act of inferioritie. The same I say if (...)
signify falling down to the ground. 2. Sitting or pitching about a place, and
sitting and lying in sackcloath, may well signify simply to be in a place, but
table-sitting and table-inclining on Christ's bosom must be more then simply
being at the Table. Nor does Calvin in that place expound sitting at table, for
nothing but simply being at table, though elsewhere he does.

3. Arg. That which represents the honor of table-fellowship of
fellow-banquetters with Christ, that is of necessary use; But sitting at the
Lords table represents this; Ergo, Luke 22. 27. The Minor is made good, to
teach the Disciples humility, he would stand and have them to sit. Whether is
greater he that sits, or he that stands? it is a greater honor to sit at
table, then to stand; Ergo it is an honor to sit, for we may well infer the
positive from the comparative, Luke 22. 29. upon the occasion of their striving
who should be greatest, and Lord Bishop, he promises a sort of fellowship in a
Kingdom. 2. In sitting on thrones with him, and the meaning that that
fellowship should quench the fire of their appetite for Prelacy. 3. This
sitting in Scripture, as table-sitting, is used to express our fellowship with
Christ in the Gospel, Mat. 22. 1. 2. Luke 22. 30. Mat. 8. 11, 12. Luke 14. 15,
16, 17. Cant. 1. 12. Cant. 5. 1. Rev. 19. 9. Rev. 3. 20. and our Communion with
Christ's body and his blood is sealed up in this Sacrament, 1 Cor. 10. 16. 4.
This is confirmed, in that the Sacramental food is not simply given as food,
(though that be a special fruit thereof) for then there should be no more
required to the essence and integrity of the Supper, but eating and drinking,
and on his alone, eating and drinking and using the words of Christ, should
receive a Sacrament, and the manner of eating should be accidental, and in the
Churches power; but this food is given as food Table-wise, with the solemnities
of a banquet, and of spiritual fellowship, which must be represented of
purpose here, and that sitting ways, so to eat and drink with Publicans is a
sign of fellowship, as Christ's eating and sitting with Publicans and sinners
made him be construed to be a friend to them, 1 Cor. 5. 11. To refuse to eat
with a fornicator, is to refuse fellowship with him, 1 Cor. 8. 10. 1 Cor. 10.
20, 21. To sit at the Idols and Devils Table, is to partake of the idol and
Satan's worship, as having fellowship with them; Ergo, to sit at the Lord* table
is to have fellowship with him. 5. The Holy Ghost speaks this fellowship,
Luke 22. 14. He sat down and the twelve Apostles, (...) with him, see a
fellowship, Math. 26. 20. He sat down, (...), with the twelve. 18. And as
they did eat (together at Table) Mark 14. 15. Luke 22. 15. With desire have
Sitting a sign of our co-heireship.
I desired to eat with you, (...), table-wise, as ver. 14. Mat. 26. 29. I will
not drink, -- until I drink it new (...). The words carry a resemblance of
drinking with them the well of life, so Augustine, Hilary, Musculus, Amesius
expoundneth them, so (as I take) he draws them from 1. This material wine.
2. From Sacramental tabling. 3. From this old fruit of the Wine. 4. From
fellowship here in the Kingdom of Grace, to 1. New wine in heaven. 2. To
heavenly tabling. 3. To new and everlasting wine. 4. In the Fathers Kingdom.
Neither am I much moved with what Paybodie says, that our Savior led the
woman of Samaria, from Jacobs well to thirst for the water of life, yet is not,
for that, Jacobs well made a type by divine institution. I answer, this would
have some color, if Christ did speak of common wine, as he did speak of
Jacobs Well, as of common water. But all the three Evangelists speak of
Sacramental wine consecrated by word and prayer, else Christ's calling bread
his body should not prove that bread were a sign of his body by divine
institution, but only we were to make that spiritual use of bread and wine,
that we make of ordinary bread and wine at our houses. Formalists then must say
that Christ speaks of wine here as common, not as Sacramental, which is
absurd when Christ is expounding the Elements, in their spiritual
signification, Luke 5. 22, 21. But behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is
(...) with me, on the table. Mat. 26. 23. Mark 14. 20. If he had been kneeling
or standing, (gestures unpossible for them then) he could not have his hand
leaning on the table, and if he had not been sitting* table-wise, in a
table-fellowship with Christ, then could not our Savior have conveniently
convinced the ingratitude of Judas, as he does. Now if Christ aim not to make
Judas his fault the greater, because Judas and he sat at one table together,
and that as an holy and Sacramental table, he had in this no more argued Judas
of ingratitude, then any of the rest of the house who communicated not with
Christ, because Christ and they did eat one material and ordinary bread
together* And in this Achitophel was a type of Judas, as David of Christ, and
that not only in this, that Achitophel did eat bread with David, and so had a
civil fellowship, but that they went together to Gods house, in company
together, Psalm. 55. 14. So had Christ and Judas fellowship together, at that
same Sacramental table: And as tabling together signifies civil fellowship,
so must fellow-tabling at one sacred Feast signify Spiritual fellowship
together. 6. Giving and not granting that fellow-sitting together were only a
common honor, not a mystical honor by divine Institution, yet since to sit
at a table with a Ruler, is an honor, 1 Samuel 20. 5. 2 Samuel 9. 13. Esther 7. 7.
Prove. 23. 1. Mat. 8. 11. Luk^ 16. 23. Luke 22. 30. And the Lords Disciples are
admitted to sit with him, as is clear in that he sat down with the twelv^,
and he sat (Luke 24. 30.) at meat with them, and took bread and blessed it.
No power on earth should dare to deprive the people of God of this honor, for
this honor was bestowed on the Lords Apostles, as communicants, not as
Apostles, and the want of Christ's bodily presence, diminishes nothing of the
honor, seeing he is really, but in a spiritual manner present, as the Lord of
the feast, with us, as he was with them. Paybodie says, When Christ sat at
table in the Passover, even then he schooled them from looking Part 2. page
187.
at honor in material or outvvard sitting, while as Luke 22. 26. he would
stand himself as a servant, and vvash his Disciples feet. Ansvv. His
non-sitting and washing their feet, being a moral, not a Sacramental teaching
them humility, does no more school them from not looking to sit, then his
non-eating, and non-drinking while he stood servant-like, does school them
from not looking to the honor of eating and drinking Sacramentally. Christ
teaches lessons of humility, not to learn us not to seek the spiritual
honor of communion with Christ, that were to teach us to be proud, and this
man is that bold to insinuate that it was a spece of pride, for the Disciples
to sit at table with Christ, and for John to lean on his bosom.

Mr. Paybodie thinks to crush this argument; Because the serving of God the
Father and giving him glory, must be incompatible Paybodie p. 268. 269.
Disputer against kneeling, Arg. 1. c. 6.
with a table-fellowship with his Son. The disputer (says he) reasons
thus; Kneeling imports an inferiority, therefore it is contrary to the person
of coheirs, which person we act by table-sitting, but do you (says he) dream
of a co-heirship, whereby you stand not in an inferiority to Christ, then when
you take on you the person of coheirs by sitting at Table, it were not lawful
either to esteem, or in a short ejaculation to call Christ your Lord and
Superior; yea so faith must have no working at the Sacrament: for Faith
imports an inferiority and dependence: We respect Christ in his banquet, as a
King inviting us to eat with him; yea, I may kneel and call God my Father, and
in so doing, I actuate the person of a co-heire.

Ans. But in this the disputer and we mean no other thing, then A sign of our
coheirship may well consist with our inferiority in worshipping Christ
that kneeling which is a note of submission, and never used in banquets,
cannot formally express, as an apt sign, the dignity of fellow-table-ship
with Christ: 2. Poor Logitian, it follows not in sitting at table, which is
the expressing sign of the honor of tablefellowship, we may not call Christ,
Lord. David sitting at Table with his Prince Saul, might well term him ( my
Lord the King) but if* David should be put to his knees at Table, and inhibited
to eat at the Table, at which his Prince did eat; no wise man will say, that
Saul had honored David with fellow-Tabling with him. For the Act of kneeling,
and non-eating were no expressing signs of fellow-Tabling, but by the contrary
of no fellow-Tabling; the Disputer has no mind to make us every way equal
with Christ, so as there can be a case, wherein it is not Lawful to esteem or
call Christ our Lord; King and Superior, this is Paybodies consequence; but
take away Table-sitting, an honor put upon us by Christ in this Sacrament,
Luke 22. 27. and substitute kneeling for it, then you take away Gods expressing
sign of Table-Fellowship in that gesture: for while the world stands,
kneeling shall never be a sign of Table-fellowship: sitting at Table is a
sign, as the Scriptures clear, but sitting takes never away our inferiority
to Christ; you may worship and actuate the person of a coheir, but not worship
in an expressing visible sign of co-heirship, and then kneel. Farther he
reasons with us, as if Table-sitting inferred an equality betwixt us, and
that Lord who is the head of men and Angels; we reason for an honor of
fellowship, not equality. David set at King Readiness Table, is not made equal
with Saul, but in Table-sitting, he does partake of Table-honour to feast with
his Prince.

If Christ should have sitten and caused his Disciples rise and wash his feet*
in that he could not have said, ( I have put the honor of Table-fellowship on
you, for you stand and wash my feet, and I sit) this (I say) had been no
table-honour, but most contrary to it: It had been indeed servant-honour, Luk
22. 27. and more then sinful men are worthy of. To kneel to Christ is an
honor, but to kneel at Tabling with him, as kneeling, is no more an expressing
sign of table-honour, nor standing and serving Christ, while he did eat is an
honor of table-fellowship. Now if any shall take away eating with Christ, at
that table, he takes away table-honour, as Papists do in taking away drinking
with Christ from the people, yet eating with Christ makes us not equal to
Christ, but take away eating, and you take away Table-honour, so take away
sitting at Table, and you take away ( eatenus) in so far the Table-honour.

But by this mean (say they) you make it necessary to sit, and of Divine
necessity. I answer, Table sitting is not so necessary, as that the want
thereof does annihilate the Sacrament, and make it to be no Sacrament at all,
but it is (as I think) many ways necessary, as first it is morally or
Theologically necessary, as being gesture sanctified by the practice of Christ
and his Apostles, upon Moral grounds, and so to be imitated by us: 2. It is
necessary, by necessity of expediency, as free from hazard of Idolatry, of
which crime kneeling in this act, is guilty. 3. It is necessary, sacramentally,
for the integrity of the Sacrament, as signifying our honor of
Table-fellowship. 4. It is by natures grounds necessary, that as this banquet
is material, having bread, wine, taking, breaking, distribution, eating,
drinking, so the external solemnity of a banquet, such as is table-sitting,
requires the same. And 5. which is our 4. Argument, 4. Arg.
it is necessary by necessity of Divine precept ( Do this in remembrance of me)
that this is included in the precept we certainly believe: 1. Because nothing
in reason can be excluded, from the precept of the first pattern, but what is
merely occasional, such as sitting is not.

2. The practice of Christ and the Apostles cannot be a will-action, and
therefore must fall under a precept: sitting cannot be occasional, upon the
reason that it was continued through occasion of the passover; for if this be
good, then eating and drinking, and the Analogy betwixt the sign and Christ,
shall be occasional, and the singing of a Psalm, as was at the Passover,
shall be occasional: for Christ retained what did equally belong to the Supper
of the Jews, and this Christian Supper, as concerning the common nature of
sacred Feasts.

5. What is proper to a table of solemn feasting, should not be denied to this,
But sitting was such; Ergo, More of this may be seen in the Nullity of Pearth
examination, and the re-examination of the five Articles of Pearth.

Whether humane Laws bind the consciences are not?

OUr Argument against Ceremonies is* that they fail against Arg. 8.
Ceremonies fail against the authority of Rulers.
the fifth Commandment, and the Authority of Rulers.

What the Civil, or Church-Ruler can command must be good, necessary, apt to
edify, and not indifferent, or neither good nor evil; Ceremonies are
acknowledged by their Fathers to be indifferent, and neither good nor evil;
Ergo, They are such as cannot be lawfully commanded. The Proposition is clear;
the Ruler must command for good, Romans 13. 4. He is the minister of God for thy
good, and all for edification, 1 Cor. 10, 23. 1 Cor. 14. 3. v. 12, 17, 26. And
therefore all means enjoined for this end, good, and Edification must conduce
thereunto of their own nature, and not by the will of men, else they edify
not. But that this may be further cleared, it is questioned, if humane Laws
bind the conscience: for which consider,

1. Did. An humane Law is taken in Concreto, when judges command what God
commands, as when they make a Law against murder. 2. In abstracto, when the
judge forbids what may tend to murder, as carrying Armor in a City in the
night.

2. Did. There is some moral equity in right humane Laws.

3. Something positive.

4. Did. There be four things to be regarded in humane Laws: 1. Public peace
of the society. 2. The credit, honor and Majesty of the Ruler, even when the
Law is unjust. 3. Obedience passive, and subjection, by patient suffering. 4.
Obedience active by doing, which is now to be considered.

Did. 5. An humane Law Civil may oblige, Ratione generalis praecepti, In
regard of the general command to obey our superiors, as the fifth Command
says* But the question is, if a humane Law, as merely positive oblige in
conscience, as if this which the Captain forbids, as, (not to speak the
vvatch-word) be in it self against the sixth Commandment (Thou shall not
murder) if no murder follow upon the not speaking of the watchword, though
it be against the fifth in the general.

Did. 6. The question is not, whether we be obliged in conscience to obey
superiors in things Lawful, or whether we be obliged in conscience to obey
Superiors, when they are sole authoritative relaters and carriers of Gods
express Law to us, for then they bring nothing of their own, to lay upon us,
and in these cases their laws are rather Gods Laws delivered by Superiors to
us, and bind the conscience. But the question is, if positive laws, in
particular matters, negatively only, conform to the word, as in matters of
Economy, and policy, as not to eat flesh in Lent, for the growth of cattle;
in matters of Art, and in ordering of war and Military Acts, commanded by
Captains, if these commandments as such oblige the conscience. Now to oblige
the conscience, is, when the not doing of such a thing brings an evil
conscience; now an evil conscience, as Pareus Pareus Com. in Romans 13. dub. v. 5.
says, Is the sense of sin committed against God, and the fear of Gods
judgment.

Distinct. 7. The conscience i^ obliged by doing, or not doing, two ways: 1.
Per se, kindly, when the fact of it self obliges, and for no respect without,
as to give alms to the poor at the Commandment of the superior: 2. When the
fact obliges for a reason from public peace, good example, and order.

1. Conclusion. When Rulers command, what God expressly commands, their Laws
obliges the conscience, Psalm. 34. 11. Come ye children hearken unto me, and I
will teach you the fear of the Lord, Prove. 4* 1. Hear ye children the
instruction of a Father.

2. Conclus. Public peace in all the commandments of Superiors, in so far, as
can be without sin, obliges the conscience, as Heb. 12. 14. Follow peace with
all men, and godliness, Psalm. 34. 14. Seek peace, and follow after it, Romans
12. 18.

3. Conclus. Subjection to the censures of Rulers by suffering patiently, is an
obligation lying upon all private persons, 1 Pet. 2. 20. But if, when ye do
well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable to God, Romans
13. 2. Whosoever therefore resists the power, resists the ordinance of God.

4. Conclus. Nothing in non-obeying unwarrantable Commandments must be done
that redoundeth to the discredit of the Ruler or the hurting of his Majesty and
honor, 1 Pet. 2. 17. Honor the King, Eccles. 10. 20. Curse not the King: For
even when we deny subjection or obedience objective, to that which they
command, yet owe we obedience official, and all due respect and reverence to
the person and eminent place of the Ruler, as Act. 7. 2. Steven calls them,
Men, brethren, and fathers, Act. 7. 51. And yet stiffenecked resisters of the
holy Ghost.

5. Conclus. Humane Laws, whither civil or Ecclesiastic, in that particular
positive matter, which they have of Art, Economy, policy, and in Gods matters
of mere humane coin and stamp, do not binds the conscience at all, per se,
kindly and of themselves. How civil positive laws bind not the conscience.
1. Nothing, but what is either Gods express word, or his word by consequence
does lay a band on the conscience of it self: But not to eat flesh in L^nt,
upon civil reasons, Not to carry Armor in the night, To wear Surplice, and to
Cross infants in Baptism, are neither Gods word expressly, nor by consequence.
The major is sure; because the word is the perfect and adequate object of
matters of Faith, and moral practice, which concerns the conscience, Psalm.
19. 7. 8. Psalm. 119. 9. John 20. 31. Prove. 8. 9. 2. Because whatever thing
lays a band on the conscience, the not doing of that would be a sin before
God, if the Ruler should never command it ( But the carrying Armor in the
night (the not wearing Surplice in Divine service) should be no sin before God,
if the ruler should never command them, as reason, Scriptures, and adversaries
teach. The Proposition I instruct from the diffinition of an obligation of
conscience, for to lay a band on the conscience is defined, to lay a command on
the soul, which ye are obliged before God to do, as you would eschew sin, and
obtain eternal salvation: So the learned Pareus Pareus Com. in Romans c. 13.
Dub. 7.
so Richard Field on the Church 4. book c. 33.
Dr. Field; so Gerson de vita spir. part. 3. lect. 4.
Gerson, and so teach Greg. de val. to. 1. disp. 7. punct. 6. Sect. ^.
Gregorius de Valentia, and Suarez tom. de legibus lib. 3. cap. 22.
Suarez. 3. None can lay on a band of not doing, under the hazard of sin, but
they that can remit sins, for the power that loses, the same binds: But
mortal men cannot bind to sin, nor loose men from sin, but where God goes
before them in binding and loosing, for they cannot bestow the grace of
pardoning sin: But he only who has the keys of David, who opens, and no man
shuts, and shuts, and no man opens. 4. Whoever can lay on bands of
Laws, to bring any under the debt of sin, must lay on bands of obligation to
eternal punishment, but God only can do this, Mat. 10. 28.

The Proposition is clear, because sin against God, essentially includes a
relative obligation to eternal punishment. 5. In matters of Gods worship this
is clear. The Schoolmen, as Aquin. 22 q. art. 1. ad. 3.
Aquina^, Suar. Deoper. 6. dierum Tract. 3. disp. 5. Sect. 1. number. 2.
Suarez, Ferra. c^^^. Gente^ cap. 21.
Ferrariensis, Conrad. 12. q. 20. art 1. A twofold goodness in things. The
will of authority cannot treat goodness in things.
Conradus teach us, that there is a twofold good. The first is, an objective
and primordiall goodness, whereby things are agreeable to Gods Law, if rulers
find not this in that good which they command, they are not just, and so not
to be obeyed. There is another goodness that comes from the will of
authority, and so only divine authority must make things good; the will and
authority of Rulers finds objective goodness in them, and therefore enacteth
Laws of things, but because they enact Laws of things, they do not therefore
become good and Lawful, It is the will of the Creator of all beings which is
the measure, rule, and cause of the goodness of things, as Adams not eating of
the tree of knowledge is good and grateful obedience, from Gods forbidding
will, and it should have been as grateful obedience to eat of that tree, if
God had commanded so. Men cannot make worlds; nor can their will create
goodness in acts indifferent, nor can their forbidding will illegittimate or
make evil any actions indifferent, and therefore things must be morally good,
and so intrinsecally good without the creative influence of humane Authority,
and from God only are they apt to edify, and to oblige the conscience in the
terms of goodness moral.

And this is strengthened, by that which in reason cannot be denied, to wit,
that it is essential to every human Law that lays any obligation on the
conscience, that it be just, nor is it to be called a Law, except it be just,
and justice and equity humane Laws have from God, the law of nature, and his
word, not from the Authority and will of men; therefore Iurists expound that ^.
F. de con^^i^. Prineip. Qu^d Principi placuit, legis babet vigorem, est verum

What pleases the Prince, has the vigor of a Law, of just things. Also the
Schoolmen, as Carduba in sum quest. 18. part 1.

Navar Driedo l. 3. De liber Christ. c. 3. ad. 5.
Driedo Castro lib. 1. de lege pena* c. 4.
Castro, as I gather out of their writings, give strong reasons, why Rulers
cannot lay an obligation on the conscience, when the matter of the Law is light
and naughty, for this were to make a man a trangressor before God, for a word,
a straw, a toy, which is unjust: Because the just weight of the matter is the
only just ground of the Laws obligation: Ergo, the will of the Lawgiver, except
he make a moat a mountain, cannot lay an obligation of necessity on man. 2. It
were a foolish law, and so no law to oblige to eternal punishment, and the
offending of 2. God for a light thing, for this were to place the way of
salvation in that wherein the way consists not. 3. Such a law were not for
edification, but for destruction of souls. 4. This was the Pharisees fault,
Mat. 23. to lay on intolerable burdens on men's souls. 5. The law of God and
nature freeth us in positive laws from guilt, in case of necessity, as David
did lawfully eat Shewbread. 6. A Civil law may not take away a man's life for
a straw, far less can it bind to Gods wrath. 7. August. De Baptis. l. c. 6.
Augustine says, they be unjust balances to esteem things great or small,
for our sole will. Out of all which I conclude, that no law as a Law, does
oblige the Conscience, but that which has from the matter moral equity, and
not from the intention of the Lawgiver, as Cajet. verbo pracepti transgressio.
Cajetan, Silvest. verbo praecept. q. 9.
Silvester, Angelus verb. lex. 11. 3.
Angelus, and Corduba q. 189. part. 2. rat. 1. 2.
Corduba teach, which intention must take a rule from the matter of the law,
and not give a rule. Gers. de vit. spir. lect. 4. c. 7. Nulla lex s^reuda est
tanquam necessaria ad salutem, qu^ non est de jure Divino.
Gerson, No law (says he) is a law to be called as necessary to salvation, (as
all good laws should be) but that which de jure Divino, is according to Gods
law, yea, we are not (says Durand. l. 2. d. 44. q. 5. numb. 6. Si Papa
praeciperet Monacho ea quae sum contra suam professionem, non motus aliqua
necessitate vel utilitate Ecclesiae, sed sola voluntate, and de hoc constaret,
and Abbas praeciperet, contrarium, obediendum esset Abbati, and non Papae.
Durandus) to obey the Pope if he command a Monk to do something, when he is
not moved to command by the necessity, the profit of the Church, but by his
own free will, and if this be known. If the Pope (faith he) for his own
will, and without necessity and utility should seclude works of
supererogation, that command should tend to destruction, and we are to obey
Christ, who is above the Pope. And therefore his mind is, that all obligation
of Conscience, in humane commandments comes from Gods will and law, that is,
from the just and necessary matter of the law, not from the will of men.

6. Conclus. All humane or Ecclesiastic laws binding the conscience, have
necessary, and not probable deduction only, by the warrant of both the M^jor
Proposition and Assumption from the Word of God, and Law of Nature. This
conclusion is against Suarez Tom. de leg. lib. 3. c. 24.
Suarez, he seeks only a probable connection betwixt obliging Laws and the
Divine law. And Greg. de valent. tom. 2. disp. 7. q. 5. punct. 6. Sect. 1.
Humane laws oblige only in so far as they agree with the Law of God.
Gregorius de valent. is in very deed against Gerson, who teaches three things
of all humane laws. 1. That they are in so far just. 2. That they in so
far oblige the Conscience, as they have necessary dependence upon natures
law, or Gods word, and therefore compares them to these precepts that
Physicians give to sick persons, they oblige the conscience of the sick, (as
I think) from the sixth Commandment, ( Thou shall do no murder,) for if the
patient sleep at such a time, or drink wine in such a case, he kills
himself, but they have not obliging power from the fifth Commandment, not as
if the King being sick were obliged by the fifth Commandment to obey the
Physician, as his superior. 3. He will have all humane laws that properly
obliges, to be only declaratory, and to manifest only the Divine law, and to
apply it to such and such a matter. The Conclusion is clear from what is said
before, because all civil laws as merely positive, in the cafe of non-contempt
do not oblige, and in the case of non-scandall, as Medina tract. De jejunio
cap. 7.
Medin. Almain. Moral. c. 12.
Almaine, Gers. uti supra.
Gerson teach. And it follows from a sure ground, that Vasquez 12. disp. 158
c. 4. number. 32. Praecipient is intentio non facit praeceptum habere majorem vel
minorem obligandi, efficaciam, sed necesfi^as, diguitas, vel utilitas little
quae praecipiuntur.
Vasquez lays down, and he has it from Dried^ de lib. Christ. l. 3. c. 3.
ad 5.
Driedo, to wit, that the efficacy of obligation in humane laws, comes not
from the will of Lawgivers, or their intention, but from the dignity or
waightines of the matter. If then the matter be not from Gods law, just, the
obligation is none at all; for if the law from man's will, shall lay on an
obligation of three degrees, whereas Gods law from Gods will, before men
inacted this in a Law, laid on an obligation of two degrees only, tying the
Conscience, then the will of man creates obligation, or the obligative power
of conscience in the matter of the Law* and by that same reason he creates
goodness, which is absurd, for that is proper to God only.

I grant it is hard, because of the variety of singular actions in man's life,
to see the connection, betwixt particulars of humane laws and Gods laws; yet a
connection there is, and for this cause the learned worthy Divine, Pareus com.
in Romans 13. v. 5. Dub. 7. Conclus. 5.
Pareus will have humane laws in particulari, and per se, in the particular
and of themselves to bind the Conscience. Whereas Calvin inst. l. 3. c. 19.
Sect. 15. 16.
Calvin, and Beza in Notis in Romans 13. A twofold consideration of humane laws.
Beza, Iunius, Tilenus, Sibrandus, Whittakerus and others deny this: But the
truth is, humane civil laws are two ways considered. 1. As they are merely
Positive and according to the letter of the Law. 2. As they have a connection
with 1. The principles of nature, of right and wrong. 2. With the end of the
law, which is the supreme law, The safety of the people, as the Civil law
says, he who enters to an inheritance and makes no Inventory of all his
goods, shall pay debts above the-whole heritage, this law according to the
letter in the Court of conscience is unjust, and so cannot oblige in
Conscience; so as he is guilty before God, and deserves the vengeance of
everlasting wrath, who does not make an inventory of all his goods, and produce
it to the Judge; so he that goes up to the walls of a City, may by the Law be
commanded to be put to death, yet is he not guilty of eternal death before
God, and therefore if the presumption which is the ground of the law cease, as
this; He that makes not an inventory with a purpose to enjoy the whole
inheritance and pay no debts, sins before God against conscience, as famous
jurists, to wit Jason.
Jason, Baldus in rubrica* F^de acquirendis b^reditatibus nu. 23. and seq.
Bartolus and others teach: for this Law considered as having connection with a
principle of nature, that every man should pay his debts, is a law binding the
Conscience, and the truth is, the end of these Laws oblige the Conscience,
they being divine expressions of justice and righteousness, but not the Laws
themselves; for whatever obliges the conscience as a divine truth, the
ignorance thereof is a sinful ignorance, and makes a man guilty of eternal
wrath, but men are not guilty and liable to the eternal wrath of God, because
they are ignorant of all the civil Laws in Justinians book; then were we
obliged to be no less versed in all the civil laws, that binds in foro
humano, then of the Bible, and law of God.

The adversaries strive to prove that these laws oblige the conscience, we may
hear Bellarm. tom. 1. cont. 5. l. 3. c. 11.

Vasquez, Valent. tom. 2. disp. 7. q. 5. punct. 6.
Valentinian, and the Formalist and Arminian, Doctor Iackson on the Creed, lib.
2. cap. 4
Doctor Jackson say, To resist the Rulers in giving, and making laws, is to
resist God, as 1 Samuel 8. They have not refused thee, but they have refused me,
that I should not reign over them. Suarez ^aith, An humane law is the nearest
cause of obligation of conscience, as the eternal law is the remote cause. And
^ackson as the immediate interposition of divine authority made the killing of
Abraham's son, holy, which otherwise would have been cruelty; so the
interposition of authority derived from God, make some actions that barely
considered would be apparently evil, and desperate, to be honest and lawful;
to strike a Prophet would seem sin, but when a Prophet commands to strike,
not to strike is disobedience, 1* Kin. 20. 35, 36. to rob a Spaniard is
Piracie, but to do it upon the Kings letter of Mart for wrongs done to the
State, is obedience to the King. Answ. To resist the servant in that wherein he
is a servant, and as a servant, is to resist God, as 1 Samuel 8. proves well.
How inferior rulers are subordinate to God in commanding.
But the assumption then is most false, for rulers in making laws, and
creating by their sole pleasure, goodness moral, in particular matters without
the word of God, are not Gods servants, nor is humane authority as humane, the
nearest cause of obligation of conscience, instamped in these laws, nor is it
the cause at all, and therefore to resist them, is not to resist God. They be
Gods instruments and Ministers in 1. Propounding and expounding Gods laws. 2.
In executing them, and defending them from the violence of men. 3. In making
positive and directory civil laws, for civil government, that are laws
improperly so called, which bind the conscience as above is said, in so far, as
they have dependence upon Gods Law: for James says, There is but one
Lawgiver. As for Church-canons, all, except Physical circumstances in them,
are to be warranted by the word. Therefore it is a vain consequence of
Valentia, humane laws oblige, dependenter a lege aeterna, as they depend on
the eternal law* Ergo, they oblige in Conscience, it follows not. They
oblige in Conscience as their Major and Minor proposition, in that which is
moral, can be proved out of Gods word, but so, in their morallity they are
merely divine, and not humane and positive, and so the argument concludes not
against us. They oblige in Conscience as they depend upon the eternal law,
that is, as they are deduced from the eternal Law of God, in a Major
proposition, without probation of the assumption, that we deny, and it is in
question now. The people 1 Samuel 8. in rejecting Samuel from being their judge,
rejected God, not because Samuel had a power of making laws, without the
warrant of Gods word. Neither Moses, nor Jeremiah, nor Ezekiel* nor any Prophet
were in that servants subordinate to God, for they were only to hear the
word at Gods mouth. 3. We could have no more at Bellarmines Bellar cont.
Barclai. cap. 3. Bon^ sensu Christus dedit Petro potestatem faciend^ de*

nearest or isntrumental cause of Laws.
hand, then Jackson says. For Bellarmine says, In a good sense Christ gave to
Peter a power, to make that which is sin, to be no sin, and that which is no
sin, to be sin. So Iackson, the interposition of derived authority, makes
that which would be murder other ways, to be a good work; that is, men may
do what God only can do. If Isaac then at the commandment of Abraham his
father, offer his son Jacob to God in a bloody Sacrifice, then Abraham's
derived authority makes that a lawful sacrifice, as to strike a Prophet of it
self, is a degree of murder, but when a Prophet commands another to strike
a Prophet, it is lawful. But can any blasphemer say, that this was humane
derived authority without warrant of the word of the Lord, such as are humane
positive laws, and our humane ceremonies, see the text, 1 King. 20. 35. And a
certain man of the sons of the Prophets, said unto his neighbor in the word
of the Lord* smite me. This was immediate, divine and Prophetical authority,
and not humane. Does the Kings letter of Mart make robbing a Spaniard lawful?
Court Parasites speak so, he refuteth himself. The Kings letter of Mart, for
wrongs done to the State, makes that which is Piracy lawful, then the Kings
authority does not here by a nomothetick power, and a law laid upon the
Conscience, but the wrongs of Piracy by Spain, done to the State of England,
may make the robbing of Spaniards an act of lawful war, and an act of
justice flowing from the King as a lawful Magistrate. Now Iackson is speaking
of mandates of Rulers in that place, which have no warrant of the word of God.
Yea, even Stapleton Stapleton de statu Eccles. cont. 5. q. 7 art. 2.
a Papist says, as Doctor Field also Field on the Church, book. 4. c. 33.
observes, That humane laws bind for the utility and neoessity of the matter,
and not from the will of the Lawgiver. And so says Gerson

we owe not to rulers, that is due to God, but we owe to them conditional

obeyed when they bring evident commission out of Scripture, I were no more

obey in Bellarm. contr. 3. lih. 4. cap. 6. not. 89. my Governors, then there
are bound to believe and obey me, for equals are obliged to obey equals, when
they bring a warrant from Gods word* and so the power of Rulers were not
real, but titular, and the same do th Sutluvius de Presbyter c. 11. 66. Sic

Sutluvius and Bellar. de interp* verbi lib* 3. cap. 4. A double obedience due
to Rulers, objective and subjective.
Bellarmine say.

Answ. We owe to equals, to Mahomet, conditional and cautionary faith and
obedience; thus, I believe what Mahomet says, so he speak Gods word, yea so
Samaritans who worshipped they knew not what, John 4. 26. gave says to their
Teachers in a blind way, so they speak according to Gods word. 2. It
follows in no sort, if Rulers are only to be obeyed when they bring Gods
Word, that then they are no more to be obeyed then equals and Infetiours,
because there is a double obedience, one of conscience, and objective coming
from the thing commanded; And in respect of this, the word has no less
authority, and does no less challenge obedience of Confcience, and objective,
when my equal speaks it in a private way, yea, when I writ it in my muse,
then when a Pastor speaks it by public authority; for we teach against
Papists, that the word borrows ^o authority from men, nor is it with
certainty of faith to be received as the Word of man, but as indeed the Word of
God, as the Scripture says: 1. There is another obedience official, which is
also obedience of Conscience, because the fifth Commandment injoyneth it. Yet
not obedience of Conscience coming from the particular, commanded in humane
Laws, as humane, so I owe obedience of subjection, and submission of
affection, of fear, love, honor, respect, by virtue of the fifth Commandment
to Rulers, when they command according to Gods Word, and this I owe not to
equals or inferiors; and so it follows not that the power of Rulers and
Synods is titular, because they must warrant their mandates from the Word. But
its always this man's hap to be against sound (i) 1* These. 2. 13. Esa. 1. 2.
^er. 1. 2. Ezekiel. 2. 7. Objective obedience no more due to Rulers then to
equals.
truth. But 3. That I owe no more objective subjection of conscience to this, (
Thou shall not murder) (Believe in Jesus Christ) when Rulers and Pastors
command them, then when I read them in Gods word. I prove 1. If this from a
Ruler ( Thou shall not murder,) challenge faith and subjection of Conscience
of six degrees, but as I read it my self, or as my equal in a private way
says, ( Thou shall not murder) it challenge says and subjection of four
degrees only, then is it more obligatory of Conscience, and so of more
intrinsecall authority, and so more the word of God when the Ruler commands
it, then when I read it, or my equal speaks it to me. This were absurd for
the speaker, whether public or private person, adds not any intrinsecall
authority to the word, for then the word should be more or less Gods word, as
the bearers were public, or private, more or less worthy. As Gods word spoken
by Amos a Prophet, should not be a word of such intrinfecall authority, as
spoken by Moses both a Prince and a Prophet. 2. My faith of subjection of
Conscience, should be resolved, as concerning the two degrees of obedience of
faith to the word spoken by the Ruler on the sole authority of the Ruler, and
not on the authority of God, the Author of his own word. 4. I answer to
Sutluvius, That Christ in the external policy of his own house is a Lawgiver,
ordaining such and such officers himself, Ezekiel. 4. 11. commanding order and
decency, and setting down a perfect discipline in the New Testament, in all
particulars that have influence, religious, moral, mystically significant in
Gods worship, and there is reason that Synods and Pastors, should rather
promulgate Gods Laws, then the people. 1. Because God has given to them by
office, the key of knowledge. 2. Because by office they are watchmen, and so
have authority of office to hear the Law at Gods mouth, and in Synods to give
Directories or Canons according to that word, which people have not, and that
their Canons must be according to Gods Word, is said in the word, Nehemiah 10.
32. Also we ^^ade ordinances for us, 34. as it is written in the law of the
Lord.

Iackson says, Of things good in themselves and apprehended so by us, without
any scruple of evil, every man's conselence htah sufficient authority Ibid. p.
259* 260.
to inioyn it, only the alacrity of doing in what time or measure it is to be
done, or such circumstances, comes within the subject of obedience to
governors.

Answ. Then because faith in Christ is evidently good by the Doctors learning,
the Pastor has no more authority to command the people to believe in Christ,
then the people has to command the same to him. So in preaching all the
necessary fundamentals of salvation, the authority of Pastors is merely
titular. There be then little necessity of a public Ministry, as Socinians
teach us. 2. The ala^rity and manner and measure of believing, and doing things
evidently good is as particularly set down in Gods Word, as obliging the
Conscience, as the Mandates themselves, God who commands us to love him, and
to believe in his Son, has not left that power to Prelates, that creates
wretched Ceremonies, to command us to love God with all our heart, or not, and
to serve God with alacrity or not, or to believe in Christ with all the heart
or with half a heart; the sincerity, measure and manner of the loving of God,
is no more the subject of obedience to rulers then the loving of God. Rulers
do command both alike, Pari authoritate, except the man say that we obey Gods
Law perfectly, when we give obedience to it, according to the substance of the
acts, though we obey not sincerely. False rules of obedience to Rulers proposed
by Doctor Jackson refuted.


The Doctor gives us Rules in obeying Rulers. We are not to adventure on the
action, whereof we are persuaded there be much evil, and no good in it.

Ans. Then we cannot venture upon Ceremonies, that brings adders to Gods
word, under all the Plagues written in Gods word.

2. Gods word, not men's persuasions of conscience (except in this also he be an
Arminian) is the rule of men's actions. The servants 3. Rule.
of Caiaphas may be persuaded there is no good, but much evil in confessing,
Christ* We are to lay aside the erroneous persuasion, and obey, if the action
be good in itself.

Iackson. Some actions apprehended as merely evil, may be undertaken with less
danger, then others which are apprehended, partly as evil, partly as good; the
action is evil as long as we fear the evil in it, to be greater then the good
we can hope for.

Ans. To do any thing as apprehended evil, of which sort are humane Ceremonies
to us, for any respect, is to do with a doubting conscience, and to sin, Romans
14. 23. 2* Gods word, not probabilities should lead us in adventuring upon
actions.

Iackson. 3. If the measure of the good apprehended, be as great as the evil
feared; in private choice, we may adventure upon the action, leaving the event
to Gods providence, which favors actions, more then privations, works rather
then idleness, and following of that which is good, rather then abstinence
from evil: for where this indifference of persuasion is* authority may cast
the balance, and sway the private choice? so also Hooker Churchpolicy 5. book

Ans. This is the Jesuit Suarez de Relig. tom 4. lib. 4. tract. 9. cap. 15.
Considerare, ^rg^ aporte^ a^ secluso precepto res sit, utraque ex part
probabilis, and tunc universaliter verum erit, adjuncto praecepto, obediendum
esse.
Suarez his doctrine, and so says the Jesuit of Corduba Thomas Sanches Jesuita
Cordubensis in Decalog. tom. 2. l. 6. c. 3. n. 3. Quado subditus dubious est an
res precepta, sitlicita nec ne tenetur obedire and exeusatur abpreceptun
superioris.
Sanches, when the subject is in a doubt, whether the thing commanded by the
Superior be lawful or not, he is obliged to obey, and he is to be excused
because of the command of the superior: 1. Because (say they) the Commanders
condition is better, and for a speculative doubt, he is not to be spoiled of
his power of commanding, where reason, says he, commands nothing against
reason: 2. Because the inferior has resigned his will to the superior, Deuteronomy.
17. 2. Paral. 19. Ergo, In things doubtsome, God commanded to stand to the
determination of the Priest, and it is a truth that the will of the Superior
does not vary and change the nature of a thing in it self; yet it varieth to
the inferiors conscience. Now indifference of persuasion is all one to Doctor
Iackson with indifferency of the thing, for so he dictates. If one have
indifferency of reasons of twelve degrees on both sides, that Arianisme, or
Arminianisme, is truth, if authority determine both to be truth, the weight of
authority in indifferency of persuasion should cast the balance, and to
believe this, or not to believe it: where Arguments are of twelve grains of
light of truth on both sides, it is to the doubting man, as if the thing were
indifferent, so is the doubter to give up his soul, conscience, and faith to
believe Arianisme to be truth, not from light of conscience, (for equally as
much light of conscience are in either side, as is supposed) but for the mere
will of humane authority, without Gods word.

Now though the matter here be indifferent in it self, yet not so to the
doubter; for Ceremonies in our persuasion are not indifferent. See here
Ignatius Loyola Ignat. loyola. cat. Jesuit lib. 2. cap. 17. and 18. Prudentia

Salas, who say in that case the subject should first lay aside his error, and
then obey. 2 God requires a full persuasion by the Lord Jesus, even in things
indifferent, Romans 14. 14, 22, 23. But poor naked humane authority cannot
engender persuasion of faith; and here is doubting* 3. It is false, That
providence favors positive actions, more then privations, for Romans 14. God
loves better abstinence from meats in themselves lawful and clean, as the
Apostle proves, ver. 14. Because nothing is unclean of it self, then that the
eater doubt, if he be not transgressing the Law of God in eating, though a
great Apostle say, there is no danger in eating.

And Jackson adds of the same nature these; The good of obedience is not a
consequent only of the action, but either an essential The good nesse of
obedience to Rulers cannot countervalue the evil in the manner of doing with a
doubting conscience and so sinfully.
part, or such a circumstance and motive precedent, as brings a new essence
for its concomitant, whereby the evil, which we out of private persuasions
fear, may be countervaled by the goodness that is in the purpose of sincere
obedience to lawful authority, as well as we conceited good probably included
in the very object of the action, he that does that which in his private
opinion he suspecteth to be evil, because enjoined by lawful authority, does
not evil that good may come of it, seeing the goodness of obedience is no
consequent of the action, but a motive precedent -- authority makes actions
indifferent to be good and necessary.

Ans. He beggeth the question: The goodness of sincere obedience to authority
(says he) may countervail the evil, that we in our private choice fear to be
in the action. But first, obedience to authority in things wanting Gods word
(whereof he speaks now) is not obedience, but sinning, because doing without
faith. 2. I take the Doctor at his word, refusing obedience to men's
willworship, or to practice even to the ruin of the weak, things indifferent,
for fear of the greatest evil, the offending of God, by adding to his worship,
Rev. 22. 18, 19. is obedience to God, and not a privation; the purpose (I say)
of this obedience to God, may countervail all evil that can be imagined in
non-obedience to men, and sure obedience to God, though probably obedience is
as good and better, then obedience to men, though probably obedience.

Jesuits and Formalists say, Rulers are in possession to command; Ergo, We
cannot thrust them out of possession, where we are not persuaded that they
command against reason, says Sanches: So I say, God is in just possession
commanding us to venture upon no indifferent action, where the conscience
doubts, and shall we not no less contend for Gods just possession, as
time-servers do for mortal Rulers unjust possession in this? 2. I prove that
it were Lawful then to sin against God: A Jew is alike persuaded, that Mary's
Son i^ the true Messiah, and that he is a deceiver: Opinions about a man, might
seem indifferent to the Jews, And it is all one (says Jackson) as if the thing
be indifferent. Now the Pharisees in a Council, determine, that Mary's Son is
a deceiver; Then it is lawful for the Jew, upon purpose of sincere obedience
to Pharisees, who sit in Moses chair, to believe, that Mary's son is a
deceiver; because the conceit of sincere obedience is an essential motive to
transubstantiate unbelief into sincere obedience, and the Jew may venture upon
the faith, that Mary's Son is a deceiver, and crucify the Lord of glory: being
commanded thereunto by his Commanders, because Gods providence favors more
positive actions, then privations. 3. He says, He that obeys for the sole
authority of Rulers, does not evil that good may come of it: 1. Because the
goodness of obedience countervaileth the evil of the actions: But 1* The
question is, if it be obedience; Ergo, If it be no obedience, it cannot
countervail the evil. 2. If it be the evil of sin, with a doubting conscience
to do what judges commands, having no warrant of faith, but the will and lust
of men, no purpose of good, though it were to save all the world, can
counter-redeem the evil of sin against God. 2. Because (says he) such a one
does not evil, that good may come of it. Then he that steals moneys to give
to the poor does not evil, that good may come of it, by Dr. Jacksons reason,
Because the goodness of purposing to help the poor is not a consequent, but a
precedent motive of the action, and so makes it good: We all know, the
intention of the end goes in the intention before the action, but not as an
essential cause to make an evil action good, or make an indifferent action
necessary and honest: A good intention does make a good action good and better,
but that a good intention (as Idolators are full of good intentions) can never
so season the means, as (this Doctor says) that it can make evil to be good,

Bellarmine says; for God only by his institution creates moral goodness in
actions; man's will is no creatrix of goodness. 4. Neither resolutions nor
skill are to be credited or followed, because private or public, because
authority of man as such, is no light nor warrant to the conscience to
adventure upon moral actions; and the Lord gives light to private men to obey,

I proceed to answer other Arguments: As 1. We must not obey, Not only for
wrath, but for conscience, the violation of a special Law, necessarily draws
with it the violation of the general Law of the fifth Commandment; But the
violation of the general, (says Learned Pareus.
Pareus) hurts the Conscience; and the Magistrate punishes not for general
Violation, but for the Violation of this special Law; Ergo, this special Law
obliges in Conscience. And it seems to carry reason. Every just punishment
presupposes essentially a sin, else it is not a just punishment; but the Ruler
does justly punish the particular Transgression of an humane Law; Ergo, the
Transgression of a particular Law of Rulers is sin. The Proposition is
confirmed by grave Schoolmen, Soto l. 1. de just. q. 6. art. 3.
Soto, Sylvest. Verb^ in obedientia in ^i^c.
Sylvester, Jo: Eselius, in ezpos. Decall. praecept. 4. cap. 36.
and Joan, Eselius, Who think that there cannot be a Law obliging to a
punishment, and not to a fault; because punishment has an intrinsecall
relation to a sin, nor can it be a just punishment that is not proportioned to
a sin; for the Law Cap. 2. De constit. Rem, quae culpa caret, in damnum vocari
non convenit. Other Arguments for the obligation of humane Laws Answered.
says, That comes not under damage, which comes not under fault.

Ans. Though the Violation of the general Law hurts the Conscience, it being
against the fifth Commandment; it follows not that the Violation of every
particular Law, even that that is merely Positive, hurts the Conscience
before God: For then the carrying of Armor in the Night, Suppose no Ruler on
earth make a Law there anent, should be a sin before God, which no wise man can
say. 2. The other reason is more important, and draws with it that
School-question agitated by Iurists also and Ganonists, An ulla detur lox pure
paenalis; If there be a Law purely Penal, without sin in it: And if the Law of
Rulers in things merely Positive, be merely Penal and co-active, and not
formally obliging to sin. But I Answer, Rulers do justly punish the
Transgression of a Positive Law, not as particularly humane and Positive: But
as 1. It has connection with the Moral Reason of the Law. 2. As the particular
transgression is scandalous and against order, in which case the formal object
of the just punishment inflicted by the Ruler, is in very deed not the simple
omission of the positive act of a particular humane Law, but the violation of
the moral goodness annexed to it, and of the scandal given. Now in this
meaning, the transgression of the positive humane Law is not kindly, Per se,
of it self punishable, but by accident, and so it binds the conscience by
accident; And in this sense, great Doctors, as Ambros.
Ambrose, Anselm.
Anselme, Theodoretus in loc. Rom 13.

Felinus, Taraqu. Prefat de utroque retractu. n. 74. What it is to resist the
Ruler.
Taraquel say, That humane Laws oblige the conscience. But the most learned of
the Canonists aver, that not to obey civil Laws, laying aside the evil of
scandal, is no mortal sin, and so does not involve the conscience in
guiltiness before God.

2. They object. To resist the Laws of the Magistrate, is to resist himself;
and to resist himself, is to resist the Ordinance of God.

Ans. To resist the Laws positive and particular in connection with the moral
reason of the Law, is to resist the Ruler, true. But so the question is not
concluded against us: for by accident in that sense, humane Laws bind the
conscience; but to resist the particular Laws, as particular Laws, as
particular positive Laws, is not to resist the Ruler: A Ruler as a Ruler, does
never command a thing merely indifferent as such, but as good, edificative,
profitable, and except you resist the morality of the positive humane Law, you
resist not the Ruler; yea, nor yet is the Law resisted.

3. The Jesuit Lod. Meratius Lodovi Merat. par. 1. tract. de leg disp. 1. Sect.
13.
objecteth: Every true Law obliges, either to guiltiness, or to punishment,
but the civil and Canonick Laws are Laws properly so called. But they do not
ever oblige to punishment only. Ergo, They oblige to sin.

Ans. It is denied that Laws civil or Canonical, as merely particularly
positive, do oblige as Laws, or that they are Laws, they be only Laws according
to the morality in them, that can promove us to our last end, eternal felicity.

It is also false that the Jesuit says, If thou will be saved, keep the
Commandments, does command the keeping of all Civil and Canonick Laws, or that
hence is concluded a Law obliging the conscience, that is, humane and positive,
as if a Lent Fast, a Pilgrimage, and not carrying Armor in the night were
commanded by Christ, as necessary to life eternal.

The same Merat. ib. Sect. 2.
Meratius striveth to answer the Argument of Almain and Gerson, which is this;
Who ever can oblige to sin mortal before God, he can inflict eternal
punishment, but no mortal man can inflict eternal punishment.

1. Says he, This Argument would prove sins against the Law of nature, as
homicide, and adultery, not to be deadly sins, for by the Law of nature,
eternal punishment is not inflicted for sins against the Law of nature, but by
the positive will of God. If any say, God is the author of the Law of nature,
because he is the Creator of that humane nature, in the which this law is
written: So, if that be sufficient that the law of nature oblige under eternal
punishment, so also the civil and Ecclesiastical law shall bind the
conscience, because he is the author of that power which makes Civil and
Ecclesiastic laws, for there is no power, but it is of God.

Ans. 1. By the Law of nature, sins against the Law of nature deserve eternal
punishment, and that essentially, laying aside the positive will of God, to
whom I grant it is free to inflict punishment, or not to inflict, and this
agrees to all sin. But to carry Armor in the night, laying aside the case of
scandal, and the morality thereof, that no murder follow thereupon, deserves
neither temporal nor eternal punishment. And if this Argument of the Jesuits
hold good, no mortal sin shall oblige to eternal punishment, because Gods
positive will is the nearest cause of actual punishment eternal in all sins.
2. God is not the Author of a propper no^othetick power in man, for that is the
question.

2. He answers, Distinguishing the Proposition. None can oblige to a mortal
sin, but he who can inflict the eternal punishment of a mortal sin. It is
true (says he) of the punishment which wholly depends upon the will of the
judge who made the Law: but it is not true of that punishment, which no way
depends upon the will of the Judge, such as is eternal punishment,
excommunication depends upon the will of man, and it obliges to eternal
punishment, yet man cannot inflict that eternal punishment: for a man may
command an act, the omission whereof, or the commission whereof, is of such
moment, that it serves much for the good of a community, and therefore he who
of knowledge and willingly does such an act, does sin against right reason,
and so against the eternal law of God.

Ans. 1. The distinction of the Jesuit is but a begging of the question. He
who can oblige to mortal sin by his Law, can also oblige to eternal
punishment, if eternal punishment depend wholy on his free will, as the
Law does; What is that, but the inflicting of eternal punishment belongs to
him who makes a Law obliging to sin mortal, so being the inflicting of
eternal punishment belong to him; But our Argument is, he who has dominion
and authority to make a Law, has dominion and authority to inflict a
punishment answerable to the transgression of that Law: for it is one dominion
Why men cannot make laws that lays a tie on the Conscience.
and power to make the Law, and to inflict the penalty of the Law: Man cannot
make the penalty of eternal wrath: Ergo, he cannot make a Law obliging to
eternal wrath.

2. Excommunication is not done by man's will, but by the power of the keys for
a mortal sin deserving excommunication, and so eternal wrath. If any
Excommunicate upon his sole will, as wicked Popes have done; in that case the
will of a man obliges neither to punishment, nor to eternal punishment, it is
but Brutum Fulmen, and not to be feared. 3. If any Commit an act that hurts a
whole Community, and is forbidden by men in Authority, he sins against the
Law of God, though men had never forbidden that Act: And we deny not but humane
Laws agreeing with the Law of Nature, does oblige the Conscience both to sin
and eternal punishment, but then they are not humane Laws, but Divine Laws,
and in that case two guiltinesses, Duo reatus, are Committed, one against the
fifth Commandment, in doing what Superiors according to Gods Word forbids,
and there is another guiltiness against the matter it self, and a Divine Law,
which also should stand as a sin before God, thought the Ruler had never
forbidden it: But if any carry Armor in the Night, being forbidden by the
Judge, for eschewing of night homicide, if no homicide follow at all, and the
matter be not known, and so not scandalous, the carrier of Armor is involved
in no guiltiness before God.

CAP. III. Of the power of the Magistrate in matters Ecclesiastical.
QUEST. 1.
That Christ has a spiritual Kingdom, not only in the power of preaching the
word, but also in the power of the keys by discipline.

COncerning the Christian Magistrate we are to consider two That Christ has a
spiritual kingdom, not only in the power of preaching the word, but also in
the power of the keys, by discipline.
heads, the one negative, what he cannot do in the matters of Christ's Kingdom:
2. Positive, What he ought to do, for the opening of the former: We are to
clear whether or no all external scandalls Ecclesiastical, as well as
civil, are to be punished by the Civil Magistrate; and that as in Civil
scandals, that disturbeth the peace of the Commonwealth, the Magistrate has a
twofold power, one to command what is good and just, another to reward and
punish; so the Lord Jesus in his Kingdom, has not only a directive power to
teach and forbid, but also a power, by way of Discipline, upon the external man
ecclesiastically to reward and punish, to bind and loose, in an external
Court on earth. It is granted by the Adversaries, that Christ as King has a
power of binding and loosing, but merely internal, purely spiritual, in
regard of the Conscience, by the Preaching of the Word; but for any external
power to take in and cast out of the Visible Kingdom of Jesus Christ his
Visible Church, This they deny, and so refuse all external Ecclesiastical
censures of receiving into the bosom of the Church, and casting out by
rebukes, or Excommunication; and therefore that there is no external Court in
the Church to punish Ecclesiastical scandals, all scandals and external
offenses of the Church, are to be punished by the Christian Magistrate only:
In opposition to which error, I say,

1. Conclusion. There is not only a rebuking of an offender in the Church, by
private admonition, as between Brother and Brother, common to all Christians,
Col. 3. 16. Levit. 19. 17. And of the Pastor only, he applying the Word by way
of Preaching to such and such offenders, and closing the Gates of the Kingdom
of Heaven upon impenitent sinners, which is acknowledged by the Adversaries:
But there is also a Church-rebuking by way of censure, which must presuppose an
Ecclesiastical Court, and a rebuking of a Public sin, put forth by many;
whereas one only, not a Church or multitude may Preach the Word, and so rebuke
by way of Preaching, which I make out from the Word of God, 2 Cor. 2. 6.
Sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many: The
word (...), a rebuke or punishment, in the old Translation, it is Objurgatio,
in the Newer, Increpatio; Piscator Muleta, is a chastisement, whether this
punishment was actual excommunication, as many Learned Interpreters do not
improbably gather out of the Text; or if it was a Rebuke of the Church in order
thereunto: Certain it included, a rebuking not of one man, but a
Church-rebuking inflicted by many, 2 Cor. 2. 6. And by the Representative
Church of Corinth, gathered together with Paul's spirit and the power of the the
Lord Jesus, 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5. And so presupposes a Court or Convention of many
inflicting this punishment. 2. The Adversaries who deny that there is such a
thing as Excommunication, say it was only a rebuke; but if it was
Excommunication, it must include a rebuke coming from the many who do
excommunicate. 3. It is such a rebuke as must be taken off and pardoned by
many, as ver. 7. So that contrariwise, ye ought rather to forgive him, and
comfort him, ver. 10. To whom ye forgive any thing, I also forgive. So here is
a rebuking put upon an offender by many convened in a Court, who did rebuke by
way of judicial Authority, and the power of the Lord Jesus; Ergo, it was some
higher censure which was inflicted by many, and taken off by many; then that
which was inflicted by one by way of Preaching, where there is no necessity
that many either rebuke, or comfort the rebuked: for one Pastor is to give out
the sentence of Death or Life, rebuking and comforting, toward any one
offender, or a person Repenting, whether many be convened to consent and join
or not. Yea, I may, being a Pastor of Jesus Christ, dispense rebukes and
comforts by way of Preaching, against the will and mind of the whole flock:
But a rebuke, and a forgiving by many, cannot be dispensed, except these many
convene together in the Name of the Lord Jesus in a Church way and consent. 2.
If the convened Church must be heard and obeyed when she rebukes a Brother,
for a fault done between Brother and Brother, and that upon the Testimony of
two or three witnesses, then is the Church a Court that is to rebuke an
offender, and so to convene him before her: and that is some other censure then
by way of Preaching; but the former is true, Matthew. 18. 16, 17. 3. If the
Churches of Jerusalem and Antioch, convened in a Synod, do give forth an
Ecclesiastical rebuke on false Teachers, as those that troubled the Churches,
and perverted their Souls with false Doctrine; then is there rebuking of
offenders by a Church or Churches, beside a Pastoral rebuking by one single
Brother or Pastor: But the former is true, Act. 15. ver. 24, 25. The
Proposition is clear, in that a select company of Apostles, Elders and
Brethren, does not only Doctrinally conclude against their error who did hold
the necessity of Circumcision, but also against the Persons, and their
Schismatic way, of troubling the Church by a (...) in making a side and
Faction in the Church, ver. 2. 24. And this not any one single man could do in
an ordinary way, except we say that it was an idle and unnecessary remedy which
the Apostles used to quench the sire, as if any one man might have done all
this, or as if they had rebuked these men publicly, not having heard and
convinced them by the Word of God; or as if an offense touching conversation
and against the second Table, had risen between Church and Church, no less
then in the present case of an offense in matter of doctrine, that the Apostles
would not have taken the same course, all which are not to be imagined. And in
very deed this was not a point of mere doctrine, but also of peace and charity,
violated by a Faction, ver. 2. And a scandal in eating things strangled, was
raised in the Churches, Acts 15. 24. 1 Cor. 10. 28, 29. Romans 14. 14, 15, 16,
17. 4. If Timothy be to rebuke publicly, those that sin publicly, and that
judicially upon the Testimony of Witnesses. Then is there a public
Church-rebuking by way of censure, beside the pastoral rebuking. But the
former is expressly said, 1 Timothy 5. 19, 20. This must be a rebuking in a
Church-court, except we say Timothy his alone was the Church, and a Monarch of
the Church, who has power to lead witnesses against Elders.

2. Conclusion. There is such a censure as excommunication in That there is
such a divine ordinance as Excommunication.
the hands of the Church, by which scandalous offenders are to be debarred from
the society of the Church, and other holy Ordinances, that they do not profane
them, which is proved from Mat. 18. 15, 16, 17, 18. Thus, he who is to be of a
brother esteemed as no brother, but as a Heathen and a Publican, and whose
offense is bound in Heaven, as the Church binds on Earth, and that upon the
testimony of Witnesses, he incurreth some other censure of real ejection out
of the society of brethren in a Church State, then Pastoral rebuking. But he
who trespasseth against his brother, and will neither be gained by private
admonition, nor by the Church rebuking him, is in such a case; Ergo, such a one
is to be excommunicated, and so Christ must have instituted such a censure.

Diverse reasons are alleged against this sense, as not favoring
excommunication.

Object. 1. If thy brother trespass against thee, is, if thy brother
Objections against excommunication removed.
trespass against God, thou knowing him to be guilty, art to deal with him,
and to bring his fault to public hearing that he may be punished.

Answ. 1. The same phrase in the same doctrine of scandals is, Luke 17. 3. Take
heed to your selves, (...): If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him,
and if he repent forgive him. But it cannot be said that if our brother
transgress against God, we knowing of that, we are not to forgive him a sin
committed against God, though he should come to us, and say that he repents,
for then might any private brother pardon murders and sorceries, and if this
private brother were a Magistrate, by this he is to forgive bloods, and not use
the sword against the evil doer, and is to dispense with it seventy seven
times, if the offender say, he repents. 2. The text says expressly, If thy
brother trespass (...) against thee, not (...) against God. It is true, sins
against a brother, are sins against God, but it is evident from the text, that
Christ speaks of such sins in a special manner, committed against me, or a
particular brother, which are within the verge of my power or his to pardon, as
no^ being yet publicly scandalous. 3. Camero says, to sin against any here,
is not to sin against Praelee. in Math. 18. ver. 15. page 144.
God with the knowledge of a brother, but it is to sin in private against a
brother, so as the offended brother is in meeknes to labor to gain him, and
not bring his fault to public, if he can be cured in private, and therefore
with much lenity we are to proceed, whereas before Christ had exhorted not to
contemn our brother, here he teaches with what loving patience and
longanimity we are to labor to gain him when he is fallen, else Christ should
say but the same thing over again, that he said once.

Object. 2. But by this place of Scripture, I should rebuke any brother whom I
know to sin against God, to the end I may gain him to repentance, and that
before two witnesses? Now this is absurd: my Father, my King and Prince before
two Witnesses; And therefore by the Church is meant a number of private
Christians before whom I am to convince my brother, and that I am not to rebuke
any offender whatsoever, is clear in that Solomon says, it is a man's glory to
pass by an offense, and we are not to over-heare our servant cursing us, Ergo,
We are not to rebuke every one, nor to bring them before any Church Court.

Answ. 1. This argument is against Christ, as well as against us, for it
tends to conclude that it is not universally true, that I am to rebuke every
offending brother, which I will grant in some sense. For 1. If the fault be
small, and possibly a matter of goods, with which I may dispense, without less
hurt to my brothers soul, then the evil of scandal may be, if I complain to
either the Church or Magistrate, I am rather to suffer wrong, 1 Cor. We
mayrebuke our brother in a prudent way.
6. 7. But because I am not to rebuke my brother imprudently, may I not
conclude from Christ's words, I may rebuke him? Or because a mean person may
not rebuke a Ruler, or a Prince, or King? Will it follow that a Nathan may not
rebuke King David, and because Jonathan may not rebuke King Saul his Father,
shall it follow that no other may rebuke King Saul? Or because I may not rebuke
a scorner, though a professing brother, or because I may not rebuke my brother
before two or three witnesses, who to my knowledge bear the offender ill will,
and so I see my rebuking shall be so far from gaining him to repentance, that
it shall provoke him to a greater offense, shall it therefore follow I am to
suffer sin in my brother and not to rebuke him at all, which the Spirit of God
calls a hating of my brother in my heart, Lev. 19. v. 18. This argument
concludes not that I may not rebuke my brother, but only that I may not
rebuke my brother imprudently, or that any brother may not rebuke any brother,
whoever he be, King or Ruler, Negatis modi non negat rem ipsam, so we are to
pass by offenses and to be willing to forgive them. Ergo, we are not to rebuke
an offending brother, it does not follow, I must be willing to forgive all,
friend, or enemy, Ergo, by this reason I am not to rebuke any at all, and
Solomon wills us only not to be swift, too glad and willing, or too quick
and sharp eared to hear every ill word, Eccles. 7. 21. Also Heb. Give not thy
heart to all words (...)
that are spoken, least thou hear thy servant curse thee. So is the same
phrase, Eccles. 1. 13. Prove. 23. 26. Eccles. 1. 17. Not unlike this is the
phrase Dan. 6. 14. The King set his heart to deliver Daniel, But this will not
prove we are not to rebuke an offending brother. 2. That by the Church here, is
meant a number of private Christians, is against the Text, for then three
witnesses should be a Church, being three private Christians, but sure it is
Christ ascends in his speech to an higher degree, to the Church who is to
hear the Witnesses, the Plaintiff and the Offender, who has power to bind,
and loose, which is nothing but a Church-court. 2. Thou have gained thy
brother, must be a spiritual gaining of him to repentance, as 1 Pet. 3. 1.
That they may be gained by the conversation of the wives, 1 Cor. 9, 20. (...)
That I may gain those that are under the Law. Ver. 21. That I may gain those
that are without Law. ver. 19. That I might gain the more. Ver. 20. (...) That
I might gain the Jews, so is the Word used for spiritual gaining, Mat. 2. 17,
20, 22. and Christ in his Sermons never speaks of civil gaining of brethren:
And 2. Because he speaks of the brother, as he is a member of a society,
where there be three or more brethren, and a Church of brethren whose help he
may seek to gain a brother; it is clear he must speak of a Church-gaining,
or of a gaining in order to a Church, and not with reference to any civil
Sanedrim or Court of Magistrates.

Object. 3.The place (says Erastus) is to be understood of lighter Erastus.
faults, for which one brother may pardon another, and which a private brother
has power to conceal, it cannot therefore in good sense be extended to
weighty scandals that are to be punished with Excommunication.

Ans. 1. A fault may be light and small in its rise, so long as it is private,
which deserves not excommunication, but if contumacie shall come to the fault,
as it is here in its growth and tendencie to scandalize many, it is not small.
2. A private fault is not hence concluded to be small; because a brother may
pardon it, and conconceale it. For Christ says to scandalize on of the least
of these that believes in him, is so great an offense, that it were good for
the man so offending, to be cast in the Sea, having a millstone hanged Mat. 18.
about his neck, ver. 6. And yet a brother is to forgive such an offense, Luke
17. 2, 3, 4. 3. In that a brother is obliged to gain his brother, from this
fault, it is clear; it is not so small a fault, and 2. Because it is a fault
to be brought to the Church; and 3. If the Offender remain obstinate, he is
therefore to be esteemed as an Heathen and a Publican, or as no brother, nor
any member of the Church; and 4. This sin is bound in earth and heaven. 5.
The text will not bear that all weigh y faults, such as Mu^ther, that defiles
the Land, or solicitation to follow strange Gods may be transacted between
brother and brother and concealed. Deuteronomy. 13. 8. Though Joseph be in this called
a just man, (as Beza observes) in that he would not make Mary his wife a
public example, nor reveal her Adultery, which was by the Law to be punished
by death, for so Joseph conceived of her.

Tell the Church, that is, ( says Erastus) tell the civil Synedry Object. 4.
of the Jews, and therefore this place is nothing for excommunication, or any
Spiritual Church Discipline, and if the Offender refuse to hear the Orthodoxe
Magistrate, then may the offended brother plead his right before the Heathen
Magistrate, and deal with the Offender, as with a Heathen, and a Publican.

Answ. In the Word of God, the word Ecclesia, Church, applied to matters of
Religion, (as it is evidently here, where it is The church Mat. 18. is not the
Civil Sanedrim.
said that the offended brother, is to labor to gain the soul of his
offending brother) does never signify a civil judicature and therefore the
exposition is insolent, and the words (...) or (...) or (...) or (...) can
never bear such a sense, we desire one parallel place in the old or new
Testament for it.

2. The scope of the place is the removal of scandals in Christ's meek,
brotherly and Christian way, ver. 6. (...) etc. Who ever shall scandalize, etc.
and ver. 7. Woe to the world because of offenses -- ver. 8. Wherefore if thy
hand or foot (...), cause thee to offend, cut them off, ver. 10. Take heed that
ye despise not one of these little ones, etc. And then he comes from active
scandals, whereby we offend others, and the way of removal of them, to passive
scandals, whereby others offends us, and the way of removal of them, ver.
15. Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go tell him the fault
betvveen thee and him. Now these sins that are to be punished by the sword of
the Civil Magistrate, or not such sins as may be transacted between brother
and brother, for homicide, blasphemy, sorcery, extortion are to be taken away
by the public sword, and this must have place, Thou shall not conceal it, thy
eye shall not spare him, and the Magistrate is the minister of God, a revenger,
to execute wrath on him that does evil, Romans 13. 4.

3. Christ hinteth not, in any sort, at any word of blood, wrath, vengeance,
the sword, evil doing, fear and terror for the sword, such as are (...), as
the office of the civil magistrate is holden forth to us in other places, as
Romans 13. 1 Pet. 2. No man, except he intended violence to the text, can dream
of such a latent, foreign and co-acted sense in the words, and if such a sense
had been intended by our Savior, he behoved in this place to erect a throne
from a divine institution, for the Magistrate, which no impartial interpreter,
can with any half side of a shadow perceive in the words.

4. The end of this process is spiritual: If he hear thee, thou have gained
thy brother to repentance, as is confirmed already from Scripture. But whether
the offender be gained to repentance or not, the Magistrate is to use the
sword, that others may fear; as a Magistrate, he is to regard the peace of the
Commonwealth, not the salvation of the offender directly.

5. Christ's way of proceeding to take away scandals between brother and
brother, is spiritual, Tell him, admonish the offender, tell the Church, that
they may rebuke and admonish, and this is a Moral way all along: But the
Magistrates proceeding is not Moral, by requests, orations, admonitions, but
by the real use of the sword to compel: for he bears not the sword in vain,
Romans 13. 4.

6. The proceeding here is with much lenity, patience, and long suffering to
gain an offender, but having recourse to the Magistrate to use his club and
sword, is rather a way of irritation, to make the gap the wider, and therefore
Paul, 1 Cor. 6. condemns this as repugnant to love, that they should go to law
one with another, before the heathen Magistrate.

7. Such an expression as this, ( Let him to thee as an heathen man and a
Publican) is never taken for the civil complaining of him before an Heathen
judge, nor does it express the use of the sword by the Magistrate; its so
insolent a phrase, that all the Greek Authors that ever wrote, cannot parallel
it; for this is a Spiritual and Moral reproach put on the offender, the
Magistrates way is a real inflicting of punishment.

8. This remedy is contrary to Paul's, 1 Cor. 6. For there the offended brother,
though the offending party be never so contumacious, has not this remedy of
Christ's to implead his brother before an heathen Magistrate, that the Apostle
takes for a sinful scandal, and sin cannot be Christ's remedy: Paul's remedy
is, Suffer rather wrong and defraudation; Paul by this interpretation should
have commanded them the contrary.

9. Where is ever the supreme Magistrate (who cannot be excluded, if this
exposition stand) called by the name of the Church.

10. How incongruous is it, that Christ should direct the Jews, who were to be
dispersed through all the earth; to go up to Jerusalem for judgment, seeing
Jerusalem was to be laid equal with the ground; and the Jews, their state,
Church* policy, and the Scepter now removed from Judah, let wise men judge.

11. The complaining to an Heathen Magistrate, or the punishing of an offender
by the sword, by no Scripture, is such a binding on earth, by the power of the
keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, as this is expounded, Matthew. 16. 19. And such a
binding as is ratified in Heaven, and that by the joint Prayers of two or three
on earth, as is here spoken, ver. 18, 19, 20. A Heathen Magistrates Sentence,
though never so just, should not be valued, except it were confirmed by the
Prayers of the Church, as the Sentence of Excommunication must be.

12. The Jewish Saenedrim was now to take an end, and expire with all the
Jewish policy; it is not to be imagined that Jesus Christ would appoint a
perishing remedy for a per^etuall and ever-enduring disease; now offenses and
scandals between brother and brother were to be in the world to the end, ver.
15. If thy brother offend, etc. And Christ says, Offenses must be, and the
remedy here is moral and perpetual: as 1. That Christ shall have a Church
visible on earth, against which the gates of Hell shall not prevail: 2. That we
first deal to gain our brother in private, ere to his greater shame, he be
brought in public, before the Church. 3. The Lords ratifying in Heaven, what
his servants shall bind and loose on earth. 4. The agreeing of two to pray
together, the conv^ening of two or three in the name of Christ, with a promise
of the presence of Christ, all these are Moral and perpetual: The Lord never
did the like of this, before or after.

13. In all the New Testament we do not read, that Christ, who was the end of
the Law, and the body now come in the flesh to abolish all Ceremonials and
temporary Laws of the Jewish Church and policy, as Jewish, did institute any
Old Testament Law, such as the Sanedrim was for offending brethren: if it be
said that this was but the right expounding of an old divine Law, now almost
buried through the corruption of men; then must Erastus show that this was an
old Law of divine institution* that the Jews were to keep this threefold order
in gaining an offending brother, and that this is now abolished, and that the
power of the Magistrate in Church-businesse, by this place is not established
to the end of the world; both which are contrary to the Principles of Erastus,
not to say that there is not in this whole Chapter, or Luke 17. where the same
purpose is handled, any shadow of reason to assert that Christ is restoring any
Ceremonial or Judicial Law to its genuine and sound meaning and sense, but by
the contrary Christ speaks of the Moral and perpetual Doctrine of scandal,
and how we are to deal with an offending brother to gain him to repentance,
either by our selves or the Church, and to forgive private injuries, even to
seventy seven times: Lastly, since Publicans and Romans converted to the
Christian says from Paganism, even at this time were Brethren, who might both
give and take scandals, it shall follow that Christ commands Gentiles to
submit to the Jewish Magistrates, this was against Christian liberty, and to
take from Caesar those things that are Cesars, which is unjust.

But, says Erastus, Publicans were not in Judah excluded from sacrifices, Lu^.
18. A Pharisee and a Publican went up to the Temple to How Publicans were
excluded from the Temple.
pray, Christ himself did eat with Publicans and sinners: therefore this phrase
(Let him be unto thee as an Heathen and a Publican) cannot express this (Let
him be excommunicated) except you say, that all heathen and Publicans were so
served by Christ, and the Jews, as if they had been excommunicated.

Ans. 1. Publicans, that were by Nation Heathens, were excluded from sacrifices
and the Temple, jure, by D^u^. 23. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I'sa. 79. 1. Lam. 1. 10.
Gods Law; but not de facto, because the Jews being under bondage to the Roman
Emperor, and spoiled of their Liberties and Laws, might not put their Laws in
execution against Heathen and Publicans; it is sufficient to us, says Beza,
that Publicans were execrable and hateful to the Jews, and (say I) that
Heathen and Publicans remaining such, are without the Church, Lev. 25 44. Lev.
26. 45 2 Kin. 16. 3. 2 Kin. 17. 8. 11. ^ Chro. 16. 35. 2 Chro. 33. 2, 9. Neh.
5. 8, 9 Psa. 9. 19. Psalm. 10. 16. Psalm. 33. 10. Psalm. 44. 2. Psa. 80. 9. Ier.
10. 2. Ezech. 23. 30. Eze. 25. 7. Joel 2. 7. Obad. v. 15 Mi^. 5. 15. Hag. 2.
22. Zach. 1. 15.
and not to be reputed as brethren, but enemies to the true Church of God, and
this is that which to us is Excommunication.

I do not doubt but Publicans went to the Temple to pray, but that is but to
Argue, A facto ad jus, not the right way, A jure ad factum: Publicans ought not
to have done so. 2. Christ the Supreme Lawgiver, who is above the Law, did
often dispense with sacrifice and positive Laws, for a work of mercy, and if he
touched the dead, and touched the skin of the Leaper, and suffered his
disciples to pluck the ears of Corn on the Sabbath day, what marvel then he
did eat with Publicans and sinners, contrary to the Letter of a positive Law,
Knowing his own, whom the Father had given to him from eternity were to be
brought in to himself, by his familiar conversing with them; why should not the
Physician converse with the sick; the shepherd with the lost sheep; the
Redeemer with his ransomed ones? But this is no warrant, that therefore the
cleansed Leaper should not show himself to the Priest, or that an obstinate
offender should not be reputed as a Heathen, and not admitted into the
Sanctuary. 3. That simple Publicans, or Heathen remaining such, should
sacrifice. I never read, sacrifices were offered for Jobs friends, who were not
within the visible Church: But 1. by Gods own special and immediate command:
as we read, Job 42. 7, 8. A positive Law for it (which yet was requisite for
ordinary worship of that kind) we read not. 2. I think Jobs friends cannot in
knowledge, Religion, Profession, be esteemed mere Heathens, and therefore as
God tied not himself to a positive and standing Law here, so neither was
Christ, being the same God equal with the Father, so restrained from not
familiar conversing with Heathen, and Publicans, but he might leap over a
Ceremony to save a lost soul.

Object. 6. But (the adversaries say) Christ here uses words proper to the
Jewish Synedry and the Old Testament, as witnesses, Ecclesia, or congregation,
Heathen, Publican, and these are not New Testament words, nor was there such a
thing as a New Testament Church on earth at this time, and Christ having not
yet ascended to Heaven, nor sent down the holy spirit, cannot be thought to
hold forth the power and jurisdiction of a thing yet destitute of all being,
such as was the Christian Church, nor can he here speak of Christ's spiritual
Kingdom.

Ans. 1. Christ did well to use these words, Witnesses, Church, Congregation,
Heathen, Publican, as well known to his hearers, and these same words in use
amongst the Jews are used in the New Testament, as 1 Cor. 16. 22. 1 Timothy 5. 19.
Act. 15. 7, 17. Revel. 11. 2, 8. 1 Pet. 4. 3. 2 Pet. 1 19. 20, 21. Anathema
Maeranatha, Witnesses, Gentiles, sinners of the Gentiles, imposition of hands,
etc. Indeed in ordinary, the Pastor under the New Testament is not called
Priest, nor high Priest, nor the Communion Table an Altar: But the words here
used are obvious and very significant; and the word (...) or Church is a most
obvious word in both the Old and New Testament, and does signify any Assembly,
Religious, civil or profane, according as the nature, person and use or end
of the meeting or Assembly was Religious and Profane, as is evident by many
places of the Old and New Testament; where the seventy Interpreters use the
word for a Church-Assembly; for which see the due right of Presbyters, page
349, 350. and page 473, 474. And since the word Church here is clearly, a
company convened to gain an offending brothers soul, by rebukes and censures,
and which has power to bind and loose on earth, so as their fact is ratified
in heaven, it cannot be any other, then a New Testament Church-meeting, seeing
we find the Church of Corinth commanded to conveene and exercise such a power,
1 Cor. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. And therefore it cannot be expounded of the ^ivill judge;
not to add, that Erastus, who objecteth this, says the Syn^dre had both
civil and spiritual or Eccl^siasticall power, and therefore he has no ground
to expound the place of the Civil Magistrate. 2. Because he was not yet
ascended to heaven, and had not sent down the Holy Spirit, it is no
consequence to say he speaks nothing of the Christian Church of the New
Testament, for before his Ascension he appointed the Ministry, the Sacraments,
the power of Censures, and the keys given to the Church of the New Testament,
Math. 28. 19, 20. Joh. 20. v. 2^, 22. Math. 26. 20, 21, 22, 23, etc. Now it is
as inconvenient, that precepts, such as ( Do this in remembrance of me,) (take
ye, eat ye,) and ( he that hears you, hears me,) should be given to the
christian Church, which yet had no being, as for Christ to hold forth the power
of jurisdiction of a Christian church destitute of all being. Yea, this
recurreth upon Erastus, who will have Christ here to hold forth the power of
the Christian Magistrate, as yet remoter from being, all Magistrates being
professed Enemies to Jesus Christ, whereas there was at this time a seed, a
bottom of a christian visible Church: There being eleven Apostles, seventy
Disciples, and many others who professed faith in Christ already come. Yea
though there be no formed instituted visible Church of the New Testament, yet
it became our great Prophet, who taught that Gospel, yea, all that he heard of
the Father, Ioh. 15. 15. to his Disciples, which was to be a rule of the Faith
of the Christian visible Church not yet instituted, and who erected a Ministry
to teach them before his ascension, also to furnish that Ministry with the
powerof the keys and censures, as he expressly does before his death, Mat. 16.
17, 18, 19. Not to add what Camero says, that he spoke these words when he
was now to offer himself on the Cross, and Math. 2. 16. He mentions the
edifying of the Church of the New Testament, and the Disciples ask who is to
be greatest in the Kingdom of God, ver. 1.

Object. 7. Let him be unto thee as an Heathen and Publican, can not mean as
much as, Let him be excommunicated, but only, let him plead with his
obstinate brother who contemns the Christian Magistrate, before the heathen
Magistrate, and in preserving the offender, who is now obstinate, let him
deal with him as with a Heathen and a Publican, only in this matter of
pursuit, but otherwise the Publican was not excommunicate. 1. Because the
Publicans place and office was good and lawful and from God, then to repute
him as a Publican is not to repute him as a profane man. 2. When John Baptist
is demanded by the Publicans what they shall do, he does not bid them lay
down the office of a Publican, but only not abuse it to rapine and extortion,
nor is Zacheus compelled by Christ to lay down his office, but only to make
restitution.

Answ. 1. There is no necessity to condemn the office of the Publican, or the
birth and condition of the Heathen as unlawful. But a Publican went for a
profane man, and for a man who is a stranger to the true church of God, as
Mat. 5. 46. If you love them that love you, what reward have you? Do not even
the Publicans the same? Ergo, It is Christ's mind to exclude the Publicans from
any spiritual or eternal reward, promised to these within the visible Church;
and when Christ was slandered by the Jews, because he went in to be a Guest
with a Publican, Luke 19. 7. And because he did eat with Publicans, Mat. 9.
12, 13. Christ takes it as granted that Publicans were profane men and
sinners. But he says they were sick sinners and lost, that is, such as were
sensible of their bypast prophanity, and desired the Physician Christ to cure
them; and Gentiles or Heathen is taken for these who are without the Church,
and are void of Religion, 1 Cor. 5. 1. Such fornication as is not so much as
named amongst the Gentiles, 1 Pet. 4. 3. Let it suffice you, that ye have
wrought the will of the Gentiles, Ephesians. 2. 11. Ye were in times past
Gentiles, what is that, but Ver. 2. Ye vvalked according to the course of the
World; according to the Prince of the power of the air? So a Samaritan, is
taken for one that has a Devil, yet to be a Samaritan Theophylact in Math. 18
(...).
by birth and nation is not unlawful, it is then a distinctive term spoken
(...) to be an Heathen, or counted an Heathen and a Publican, that is, counted
a profane wicked person, not a brother, not a member of the church.
Theophylact expounds this with us, If he hear not the Church, let him be an
outcast, least he rub any of his wickedness upon others within the Church.

And these words Let him be to thee, is a word of command, as Mat. 5. 37. (...)
Let your speech be yea, yea, Mat. 20. he that would be greatest, let him be
your servant; and, let him be to thee, is not to exclude the Church, but it is
set down in a Law-manner in the second person, for far more must the
obstinate offender be as an Heathen and a Publican to the Church.

Ver. 18. Verily I say unto you, What ye bind on earth, shall be bound in
heaven, and what ye loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven. These words
contain a reason why he who contemns the Church, is to be holden as a Heathen
and a Publican. Why? is it such an offense before God to despise the church?
Yea, says our Savior, with a grave asseveration, Verily I say unto you, they
that despise the sentence of you the Ministers of the Gospel, being according
to truth given out, they and their sins shall be bound in Heaven.

Erastus says, he is said to bind, who does retain the sin, when Object. 8.
he makes the obstinate brother unexcusable; and he loses, who remitteth or
pardons the injury, and gains to repentance his brother by a brotherly
admonition, for except he speak of a brotherly composing of private injuries,
to what end should Christ subjoyne (...) Again I say to you if two agree, etc.

Answ. 1. Christ does argue from the less to the more, he proves what the
Church binds on earth, shall be bound in Heaven, because if the prayers of
two or three gathered together in the name of God, and agreeing together on
earth, are not rejected in Heaven, far more shall that be ratified in heaven,
which the whole church of Christ decrees on earth in the name of the head of
the Church, Jesus Christ. 2. When in the chapter going before, Christ had
ascribed to the Apostles and Pastors, which are the eyes of the Church, a power
of the keys, and here he ascribes to them the power of binding and loosing,
there was no cause to dream that he speaks here of a private forgiving of
private finnes between Brother and brother, for then he might have said at the
first step, Thou have gained thy brother, that gaining or convincing of thy
brother shall be bound or loosed in heaven, no less then the Churches
judicial binding and loosing in heaven, which yet is set down as an higher
degree of power. But I may here say with Beza in the whole Scripture, the word
of binding and Beza de de Presbyterio and excom. p. 60.
loosing is never spoken of any other but of these who are in public places,
and by a borrowed speech, here it is spoken in regard of Spiritual power. To
bind and to loose, is by a judicial power in subordination to Christ the King,
to remit and retain sins. So Joseph de bello Iudai^ l. 1. c. 4. Pharisaei
omnia pro arbitrio administrabant, (...) Lucian. dialo. 1. (...).
Josephus says, the Pharisees ruled all, so that they would banish or recall
from banishment, loose and bind whom they pleased, and upon the Authority
according to the which Christ sent his Disciples as the Father sent him, so he
instructed his Ministers with power to remit and retain sins, Ioh. 20. 23.
and Mat. 16. 19. What thou bindest (...), on earth, shall be bound in heaven,
what thou loosest on earth, shall be loosed in heaven, (...). So does Lucian
bring in that prisoner speaking to Jupiter, Loose me, O Jupiter, for I have
suffered grievous things, Mat. 22. 13. Then the King said to his servants, take
him, (...), bind him hand and foot; binding here (you see) is done by the
command of the great King, Acts 21. 11. So shall the Jews (...) bind Paul,
they bound Paul with Law and authority, such as it was, John 18. 12. The
Captain and Officers took Jesus, (...) and bound him, they bound him not by
private authority, Mat. 27. 2. and Act. 24. 27. Felix left Paul (...) bound; if
Lictors bind any Malefactors, they do it by authority and Law. So do the
Hebrews speak, Psalm. 105. 20. The Ruler of the people loosed So does the word
(...) Number. 11. 28. signify.
him, Psalm. 102. 20. The Lord looks down from heaven, (...) to open or loose
the children of death. Psalm, 146. 7. The Lord loses the Prisoners, Job 12. 18.

3. It cannot be denied, but when one private brother pardons another repenting
Brother, God ratifieth that in heaven. But it is clear the pardon here holden
forth by our Savior, is such a loosing, as has witnesses going before. 2.
Such an one as comes higher to the knowledge of the Chuuch. Nor does the
particle Binding and loosing acts judicial.
(...) again, signify any thing but preterea, moreover.

4. And who can say that binding and loosing here, is some other thing then
binding and loosing in the Chap. 16. ver. 9. Where the same very phrase in the
Greek is one and the same, except that the Lord speaks, Mat. 16. 19. in the
singular number to Peter, as representing the teachers and Governors of the
Church, and here Mat. 18. He speaks in the Plural number, relating to the
Church. Now Mat. i6. i8, 19. binding on earth, and loosing, which is ratified
in heaven, is evidently the exercise of the power of the keys of the Kingdom
of Heaven, I will give to thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. What be
these keys, he expounds in the same very verse, and whatsoever thou shall
bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven, whatsoever thou shall loose on earth,
shall be loosed in heaven; then binding and loosing on earth, must be in these
to whom Christ has committed the power of the keys: but 1. Christ has not
committed the keys to all, but to Church-rulers, that are the Stewards of the
House, and the dispensers of heavenly Mysteries. Hence the keys in Scripture
signify authority and official dignity that is in Rulers, not in private men,
as Esa. 22. 22. And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder.
So Christ is said to have the key of David, to open and no man shuts, to
shut and no man opens. By which out of doubt (says Camero prelect. in Mat.
16.

Pareus agree, that the keys are insigne potestatis, an Ensign of power given
to the Steward or Master of a Noblemans house, who is a person in office; The
giving of the keys (says worthy Mr. Cotton,) is a giving power for the
preaching of the word, the administering of the seals and censures, by which
these invested with power do open and shut the gates. Now we desire any Word
of God, by which it can be made good, that the keys and power to bind and
loose is given to all that are in the house, even private Christians. But we
can show the Keys, and binding and loosing, and opening and shutting to be
given to the Officers and Rulers of the house. Hence I argue that
interpretation that confounds the key-bearers, and the Children, with the
Servants of the House; and the Governors that are over the people in the Lord,
with the governed, and puts the Characters proper to the Officers and
Stewards, con^usedly (i) Cotton Keys of the Kingdom p. 2.
upon all that are in the house, is not to be holden; but this interpretation
is such; Ergo, etc. also to bind and to loose is expounded by Christ, Ioh. 20.
21. to be a power to retain and remit sins on earth, which are accordingly
retained and remitted in Heaven, and that by virtue of a calling, and
Ministerial mission, according to which the Father sent Christ Jesus; and
Jesus Christ sends his Apostles and Pastors to the end of the world, as is
clear, if we compare Matthew. 18. 18. and Matthew. 16. 19. with Ioh. 20. 20, 21,
22. 23. Mar. 16. ver. 15, 20. Matthew. 28. 18, 19, 20. Luke 24. 45, 46, 47, 48.

5. It is against the course of the Text, that we should restrain this to
private pardoning of light injuries between brother and brother: 1. Becase
Christ labors to decline this, that one shall be both his brothers judge to
put him in the condition of an Heathen and Publican, and bind his brothers
sins in Heaven and Earth, and also, that he should be his party and accuser:
Now Christ will have the private brother do no more personally, but admonish
his brother and gain him. 2. If that prevail not, then he is to admonish him
before two or three witnesses: See here, the brother is not both party and
judge; but witnesses have place. 3. If that prevail not, the business is to
ascend higher, even to the Church, which undoubtedly is an Organicall body, 1
Cor. 12. 28. Romans 8. 6, 7, etc. Act. 20. 28, 29, 30. Whereas two or three
private Christians are not a Church, but an homogeneal body: Now who would
believe that Christ is to bring down the business which is so high, as before
the Church, to the lowest step again, to a private binding and loosing to one
brother, who both as judge and party judges his brother; yea, and may do this,
though there were no Church on earth? What power has the Church above the
offended brother, or the offender, if the one may bind the other under
guiltiness in earth and heaven? 2. Erastus will have light and private
offenses only spoken of here: Now Christ speaks of offenses that God takes
notice of in Heaven and earth. 3. Christ's way is a wise and meek way, that that
which one cannot do, and the offense that two, three, four cannot remove, the
Church shall remove, but Erastus makes one private man to remove it, and to
Excommunicate and Beza de Pres byter, page 63, 64.
bind in heaven and earth. I might cite, Tertullian, Cyprian, Augustine,
Chrysostom, The ophylact, Hyeronimus, and all modern interpreters both Popish
and Orthodox for this interpretation, not any of them dreaming of the insolent
opinion of Erastus, who misapplieth Augustine and Theophylact for his own way,
as Beza clears.

CAP. IV.
Quest. 1.
That the place, 1 Corinthians 5. does evince that Excommunication is an
Ordinance of God.

THE Argument for Excommunication may be thus framed, from That Excommunication
is a divine Ordinance is proved by 1 Cor. 5.
1 Cor. 5. If Paul command that the incestuous man should be delivered to Satan
ver. 5. purged out of the Church, least as leaven he should corrupt the Church,
ver. 6, 7. That they should judge him, ver. 12. And put him away from amongst
them, ver. 13. So as they were not to eat with him, ver. 9. 10. Then is there
a divine command for Excommunication; for the Commandments of the Apostles are
the Commandments of the Lord, 1 Cor. 14. 37. 2 Pet. 3. 2. But the former is
true: Ergo, so is the latter.

There is no ground or shadow of reason to expound this expelling of the
incestuous man by the preaching of the word without any Church Censures, for
all that is required in Excommunication is here; 1. This putting out was not
done by one single Pastor, as putting out by the preaching of the word is done,
but by a company and Church, ver. 4. In the name of the Lord Jesus, when ye
are gathered together, and my spirit. 2. Paul should have written to any one
Pastor to cast him out by preaching; but here he writes to a Church: 3. He
forbids company, or eating with such like men, v. 10. Now this is more then
rebuking by preaching. 4. This is a judging of the incestuous man, and a
casting of him out of their society, which is another thing then preaching the
word.

Erastus and others expound the giving to Satan, of a delivering To deliver to
Satan is not miraculous killing.
of the man to Satan, to be miraculously killed, as were Ananias and Saphira,
Act. 5. 5. And because at this time there was no Christian Magistrate to use
the sword against the man, therefore he writes to the Church, that they by
their prayers would obtain of God, that Satan might take him out of the midst
of them.

Ans. This insolent interpretation wants all warrant of the word: For 1. To
deliver to Satan, has no Scripture to make this sense of it, to pray that
Satan would destroy the man. 2. It wants an example in the old or new
Testament, that the whole Church are fellow-Agents and joint causes in the
bodily destruction of any, or in working of miracles, such as was the killing
of Ananias and Saphira: The Apostles wrought miracles, and that by their Faith
and Prayers, and Christ and the Prophets; but that the Believers, who should
have mourned for this scandal, 1. Who were puffed up: 2. Who were in danger to
be leavened with the man's sin, and had their consent in Excommunication, should
join in a miraculous delivering to Satan, is an unparalleld practice in the
word. 3. To deliver to Satan, cannot be expounded here: but as 1 Timothy 1. 20.
Where Paul says he had delivered Hymenaeus and Alexander to Satan, now that
was not to kill them, but (...), that they might receive instruction and be
disciplined, by this medicinal Church-revenge, not to blaspheme: I know of no
instructing of these who are dead; if there be two deliverings to Satan, let
Erastus and his expound it to us. 4. The Apostle expressly says, he wrote to
them, not to keep company with such men, nor with Fornicators, covetous men,
Drunkards, Extortioners, Idolators: Now Erastus his mind must be, that the
Apostles and Churches of Corinth, Philippi, Thessalonica, grievou^ly sinned
against God, in that they did not miraculously kill all the Drunkards, the
covetous persons, the fornicators, whereas they are commanded to admonish them
as brethren, 2 Thessalonians. 3 14, 15. and to pray for them, if they sin not against
the holy Ghost, 1 Ioh.. 5. 16. 1 Timothy.* 2. 3. 5. Paul rebukes this as a moral
fault amongst the Corinthians, such as is not to mourn for this man's fault, and
to keep him as leaven in the midst of them, and not to cast him out: Whereas in
all the Scripture you find none ever rebuked, because they put not forth in
Acts an extraordinary and miraculous power to work miracles; working of
miracles came upon persons called thereunto, by extraordinary rapts, and were
in men not as habits under the power of free will, but as immediate Acts of
God, even as fire-flaughts are in the Air: So I conceive, while I be better
informed. 6. And shall it not follow, that now when the Churches have Christian
Magistrates, it is the will of our meek savior, that they kill with the sword
all the Drunkards, Fornicators, and all that walks unorderly; which should
make the Church of Christ a Butcher-house, whereas we are to admonish all such
as brethren, 2 Thessalonians. 3. 15. And to wait on them with all patience, if God
peradventure may give them repentance. 7. The destruction of the flesh must be
the destruction of the body. But the bodies of the godly are saved no less
then their spirits in the day of the Lord. 8. And for many of the former
reasons, by delivering to Satan, cannot be meant a miraculous tormenting of the
body by Satan, with the saving of the life; Such as we read was the case of
Job; for the delivering to Satan, is to cast out of the Church, and declare
such an offender to be of the number of the wicked world, of which Satan is
Prince, Ioh. 12. 31. Ioh. 14. 30. and God, 2 Cor. 4. 4. and that which we
assert as The essentials of excommunication, 1 Cor, 5.
the essentials of excommunication, are, 1. Here is a member of the Church, one
who is within, 1 Cor. 5. 12. one who has fallen in a foul scandal, and had
his fathers wife, ver. 1. who by the Church conveened in the name of our Lord
Jesus, with that spirit of the Apostle given to them by Christ, v. 4. was
delivered to Satan, that his soul may be saved, (for that is the genuine and
intrinsecall end of Excommunication,) and to be purged out of the Church, lest
he should infect the Sheep, ver. 7. and Christians were not to bear company
with him, nor to eat with him, ver. 9. 10* and he was judged to be cast out as
a Heathen and Publican, ver. 12. 13. and that by a convened court, having the
name and authority of him who is King of the Church, ver. 4. and more we do
not crave. Obj. To deliver any to the power of Satan, is no mean of salvation.
Answ. A moral delivering to the efficacy of error, and a reprobate mind, is
not a mean of salvation, nor is excommunication such a mean, nor in the power
of the Church, but a medicinal depriving of an offender of the comfortable
communion of the Saints, and of the prayers of the Church, and means of grace,
such is a means, and mighty through God to humble.

CAP. V.
Quest. 1.
Whether the word does warrant discipline and censures, even to the excluding
of the scandalous from the Sacraments, beside the Pastoral rebukes inflicted
by one.

WE are not to conceive that there was nothing Moral in the Laws that God
made to his people of Israel, to debar the unclean, from the society of Gods
people, and from communion with them in the holy things of God, Numb. 5. 1. And
the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying: 2. Command the children of Israel that they
put out of the Camp every leaper, and every one that has an issue, and
whosoever is defiled by the dead, Lev. 5. 2. If a soul touch any unclean thing,
whither it be a carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle,
or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him, he
also shall be unclean and guilty -- 6. And he shall bring his
trespasse-offering unto the Lord for his sin, which he has sinned, Lev. 7. 20.
But the soul that eats of the sacrifice of the peace offerings that
pertains to the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall
be cut off from the people: 21. Moreover Cutting off not always killing.
the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or
any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the
sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the Lord, even that soul shall
be cut off from his people. In the which observe, that here the soul that shall
touch any unclean thing is to be cut off; but Number. 5. 2. He is only to be put
out of the Camp; now these were not killed that were put out of the Camp, and
therefore to be cut off from the people must be a moral cutting off by
Excommunication, not by death; also the word (...) signifies to make a
Covenant, to cut off, either by death or any other way* as by banishment, by
which a thing leaves off to be in use, though it be not destroyed, as when a
branch is cut off a tree, 1 Samuel 31. 9. Yea, we have Isa. 50. 1. (...) Where is
that Bill of cutting off or divorce: Now this was not a Bill of killing the
wife that was divorced, but putting her from her husband, as our Savior says,
It is not Lawful to marry her that is divorced, Matthew. 19. 9. A killed and
dead woman is not capable of marriage; yet the word is, Deuteronomy. 24 1. Ier. 3. 8.
from that same Theme, (...): The Hebrews (...) Ab interi^re popul^rum sacrum*
have another more ordinary word to signify death, as Exodus 31. 14. He that
does any work on the Sabbath, in dying he shall die: And it is expounded, he
shall be cut off from the midst of the people: (...) but Lev. 7. the word (...)
is four times used without any such expression, ver. 20, 21, 25, 27. To which
may be added, that when zealous Hezechiah did find that the people were not
prepared, According to the purification of the Sanctuary, though they had
celebrated the Passover, the King did not only not kill them, but prayed, God
might be merciful to them, and the Lord killed them not (says the spirit of
God) but healed them, Exodus 12. 15. He that eats unleavened bread, that soul
shall be cut off from Israel: but it is expounded, ver. 19. That soul shall be
cut off (...) from the Church of Israel: Certainly, he that is killed is cut
off from both State and Church, and from the company of all mortal men on
earth, Isa. 38. 11. Then to be cut off from Israel is only to be deprived of
the comfortable society of the Church of Israel, as the holy Ghost expounds
it: Also Lev. 4. If any commit any sin but of ignorance, and so if he touch any
unclean thing, or eat unleavened bread, forbidden of God, he is excluded from
the holy things of God, while the Priest offer for him, according to the Law:
Now if he was presently to be killed, either by the Magistrate, or in that act
killed by Gods own immediate hand, as Aarons sons were, there was not a journey
to be made to the place, the Lord had chosen to sacrifice there, which might
have been three days journey from his house, who was unclean; yea, when the
man that gathered sticks was stoned, and the false Prophet stoned, Deuteronomy. 13.
there was no sacrifices offered for any of them before they were killed; and I
hope, there were no sacrifices in Moses his Law offered for the dead. Hence
learn we: 1. That to cut off from the Congregation, was not to kill, but it was
the Jewish Excommunication greater or less: 2. That Moral sins, under the Old
Testament debarred men from the holy things of God, while the Priests
sacrificed for them* and brought them in a capacity to receive the holy things
of God.

Leviticus 10. 10. The Priests were not to drink wine, when they Moral
guiltiness excluded men from holy things amongst the Jews.
went into the Tabernacle: That ye may (says the Lord) put difference between
holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean: Now Haggai expressly says, cap.
2. 11, 12. That it was the Priests part to put this difference, and so to admit
to, or exclude from the holy things of God.

Hence for this cause it is said, as 2 Chronicles. 23. 19. Iehoiada appointed the
officers of the Lords house, so he set porters at the gates of the house of the
Lord, that none which are unclean in any thing, might enter in; so Ezra 9. 21,
22. None did eat the Passover, but such as were pure, and had separated
themselves from the filthiness of the Heathen of the land; for this cause does
the Lord complain of the Priests, Ezech. 22. 26. Her Priests have violated my
law, and have polluted my holy things, they have put no difference between the
holy and the profane; neither have they showed the difference between the
unclean and the clean, Ezech. 44. 6. And thou shall say to the Rebellious, even
to the house of Israel, thus says the Lord God; O ye house of Israel, let it
suffice you of all your abominations: 7. That ye have brought into my
sanctuary, strangers uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be
in my sanctuary to pollute it, even my house, when ye offered my bread, the fat
and the blood, and they have broken my Covenant, because of all your
abominations: 8. And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things: But ye have
set keepers of my Charge in my Sanctuary for your selves. 9. Thus says the
Lord God, no stranger uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh shall
enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel:
Here is a complaint, that those that have the charge of the holy things, should
suffer the holy things to be polluted: I grant it cannot bear this sense, that
none should be admitted to be Members of the Visible Church under the New
Testament, but such as are conceived to be regenerate; except it can be proved
that the Sanctuary was a type of the visible Church: 2. That the Apostles
constituted their Churches thus; but we read not in all the New Testament of
any admission of Church Members at all: but only of baptizing of those who were
willing to be baptized, and from this resulted the capacity of a Church
Relation in all Churches visible: Nor, 2. Do we find any shadow in all the
word of God, of trial of Church Members, by way of electing and choosing of
such and such, as qualified by reason of a conceived regeneration in the
persons chosen, or of rejecting and refusing others as conceived to have no
inward work of grace in them; this I believe can never be made good out of the
word of God. 3. They must prove the Apostles admitted into the Sanctuary of the
Visible Church Ananias, Saphira, Simon Magus, and others uncircumcised in
heart, to pollute the holy things of God, and that the Apostles erred, and were
deceived in the moulding of the first Apostolic Church in the world, which was
to be a rule and pattern to all Churches in the New Testament, to all Ages: I
deny not, but they might have erred according to the grounds of these, who urge
the comparison for a Church of visible Saints, but that the Apostles De facto
did err in their Election and judgment, in that wherein the holy Ghost
holds them forth and their acts to be our rule and pattern, I utterly deny: I
grant Act. 15. In that Synod they did Act as men and Elders, not as Apostles,
but that it could fall out, that they should uctually err, and obtrude false
Doctrine instead of truth to the Churches in that Synod which is the first rule
and pattern of Synods, I shall not believe.

But there is this Moral and perpetual truth in these Scriptures* 1. That
there are under the New Testament, some over the people of God in the Lord,
some that watch for their souls, and govern them; as here there were Priests,
Levites that taught and governed the people: 2. That the Rulers of the
Churches, always are to have the charge of the holy things; and to see that
these holy things, the Seals and Sacraments and word of promise be not
polluted, and that therefore they have power given them to debar such and such
profane from the Seals, and so are to discern between the clean and the
unclean, and this which the Prophet speaks, ver. 9. is a prophecy never
fulfilled after this in the persons of the people of God; therefore it must
have its spiritual truth fulfilled under the New Testament, as is clear, ver.
11. Yet the Levites that are gone away The place Ezekiel 44. v. 11. 12. 13. 14.
to be fulfilled under the New Testament.
far from me, shall be Ministers in my Sanctuary, having charge at the gates
of the House, and Ministering to the House -- 14. And I will make them keepers
of the charge of the House, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall
be done therein, Ver. 15. And the Priests and the Levites the sons of Zadok,
that kept the charge of my Sanctuary, when the children of Israel went astray
from me -- they shall enter into my Sanctuary, and they shall come near to my
Table to minister unto me, and to keep my charge -- 23. And they shall teach my
people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause men to discern
between the unclean and the clean. 24. And in controversy they shall stand
in judgment, and they shall judge it according to my judgment, and they shall
keep my Laws and my Statutes, in all mine assemblies, and they shall hallow
my Sabbaths. Now this Temple was another house, then Solomon's Temple, as is
evident out of the Text, it having rooms, dimensions, structures, so different
that none can imagine them one house, and these chapters contain the division
of the Holy Land, which after the captivity was never done, for the ten Tribes
never returned, and this Temple is clearly a type of the new Jerusalem, and
agrees to that City spoken of, Revelation, chapters 21. and 22. As may appear
especially by the four last chapters of Ezekiel, and in the last words of the
last chapter, And the name of the city from that day shall be, The Lord is
there. And the Priests after the captivity as well as before brake the covenant
of Levi, Mal. 2. And therefore I see it not fulfilled, except in the visible
Church of the New Testament, and in the Assemblies of Christian Churches, Mat.
18. Act. 15. and the rest of the Church Assemblies under the New Testament: As
for the Lords personal reign on earth, it is acknowledged there shall be no
Church policy in it, no Word, Sacraments, Ordinances, no Temple, as they say
from Rev. 21. 22. And with correction and submission, the Priests and Levites,
that Ezekiel. 44. 15. are said to keep the charge of the Lords House, when others
went astray, I take to be a prophecy of these Pastors under the New Testament,
to wit, the Apostles of Jesus Christ, and Pastors, and teachers that Christ
left in his Church; for the edifying of his body, Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. When these
Scribes and Pharisees did sit in Moses his chair for a while, Mat. 23. but
only as porters and inferior Officers in Gods house, yet they were to be
heard, while God should cut them off, as he prophesied, Zach. 11. 8.

We cannot say as some do, that persons were deprived amongst Object.
the Jews, of Church communion in the holy things of God, because of
Ceremonial, not of Moral uncleannes, but now under the new Testament only
Moral uncleannes can exclude persons from the holy things of God; and
therefore to argue from ceremonial uncleannes in the old, to moral
uncleanness in the new, is no good consequence. I Ceremonial exclusion from
holy things under the old, did tipifie exclusion for moral uncleanness under
the New Testament. Levit. 5. 2^.
answer, the Ceremonial uncleanness in the Old, which did exclude from the
holy things of God, does strongly conclude that moral uncleanness under the
New Testament does exclude from the holy things of God, if that exclusion of
the Leaper out of the camp seven days, and the touching of the dead, though
imprudently, did typifie some other exclusion from the holy things of God, as
no question it did, then the consequence must be strong. 2. It is also false
that moral uncleanness did not exclude from the holy things of God under the
Old Testament, For 1. what was more ordinary, then that sacrifices should be
offered for sins of ignorance, for trespas^es, and while this was done, the
person was not admitted to partake of the holy things of God. 2. Whence was the
Lords frequent complaints of wearying his soul with sacrifices, solemn
assemblies, feast days, and new Moons, when they were morally unclean, and
their hands were full of blood, and they had not put away the evil of their
doings, did not love judgment and justice, Isaiah 10. 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18,
19. And when God complains so of them, Ier. 7. 8. Will ye steal, murder and
commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk
after other Gods whom ye know not? 10. And come and stand before me in this
house, which is called by my Name? Ergo, Murderers and adulterers were
debarred from entering into the Congregation of the Lord, and partaking of the
holy things of God, while they repented. Let none say by prophesying, or the
keys of knowledge in preaching the Word, they were declared unworthy to enter
into the Temple; but that will not conclude that it was the Priests office by
power of discipline to exclude them from coming unto the Sanctuary of God. Ans.
But if the Porters were set at doors of the Lords house, to hold out the
unclean, and if the Lord charge the Priests with this crime, that they Ezekiel.
44. 8. set keepers of the charge of the Lords house for themselves, that is,
for their own carnal ends, and not for the honor of the Lord: And that ver.
7. They brought into the Sanctuary of the Lords house uncircumcised in heart,
that is, such as were morally unclean, then had the Priests a power to debar
from the Sanctuary such as were morally unclean, and if the Priests are said
to bear rule by their means, Ier. 5. 31. Then the Priests did bear rule and
govern, though they abused their Power, and the word (...) signifies to have
dominion over any, Psalm. 72. 8. Psalm. 110. 2. 1 Kin. 4. 24. Levit. 26. 17. And
the Scripture gives a power of judging and governing to the Priests. And 2 Chronicles. 30. 6, 7. The Posts that Hezekiah and the Congregation of Israel sent
through the Land, commands a moral preparation to those that were to keep
the Lords Passover, to wit, that they should turn again unto the Lord God of
Abraham, and should not be like their Fathers, nor like their Brethren, that
trespassed against the Lord God of their Fathers. And ver. 11. diverse of Ashur,
and Manasseh, and Zebulun humblid themselves, and came to Jerusalem to keep the
feast of the Passover. This proves clearly that people under the Old
Testament were no less to try and examine themselves, by the King and Priests
commandment, carried to them by Posts before they should eat the Passover;
then they are to try themselves before they eat and drink at the Lords
Supper: only the adversaries say, the Priests by preaching were to debar
from the Passover those who were morally unclean, but not to debar those who
were morally unclean, so they were not typically and ceremonially unclean, by
any power of Discipline, or by Porters set at the gates to keep them out of
the Sanctuary. But I answer, 1. How are the Priests Ezekiel. 22. 26. reproved for
violating the Law of God, and profaning his holy things, in that they put no
difference between the holy and profane, the clean and the unclean? Surely the
Priests profaned in the highest way, the holy things of God, in admitting into
the Sanctuary, those who were not only ceremonially, but morally unclean, as
murderers, adulterers, Who cried the temple of the Lord, Ier. 7. And they put
no difference between the Holy and Profane, when they admitted to the holy
things of God, and into the Sanctuary the uncircumcised in heart, for they do
more pollute the holy things of God, who partake of them being morally
unclean, and uncircumcised in heart, then those who are only uncircumcised in
flesh.

way but morally, and by preaching (as it would seem) only debar scandalous
persons from the Seals and Prayers of the Church; for should a scandalous
person, or an excommunicate person obtrude himself on the Lords Supper,
against the will and sentence of the Church, the Church cannot use any bodily
violence to hinder such profane intrusion upon the holy things of God, because
the Churches weapons are not carnal but spiritual; bodily violence can be no
Remonstrant in Apollo.
spiritual weapon, that the Church as the Church can use, so do the
Remonstrant Arminians argue, and some other for the congregationall way.

Ans. This Argument is against all Church Censures, but though the Church as
the Church cannot hinder scandalous intruders upon the holy things of God, by
bodily violence, it does not follow; Ergo, The Church can keep the holy things
pure no way, but morally, that is, by preaching only, for we can give a third
way: The rebukes, admonitions and Excommunication, or delivering to Satan

are all transacted without any bodily and externnll violence, Christ's Kingdom
resigneth all such carnal weapons to the Magistrate, who is the only Governor
of the Church of Christ, as the Opponents say, All Church Censures are by way
of Declaration, applied to such men by name; and there co-action, though
penal, is not by bodily violence, but by acting upon the conscience of men and
putting them to shame.

Hence 2. We argue, if beside the preaching of the word, in Arg. 2.
which Commandments, Promises and threatenings are proposed to all in general;
there be rebukes of the Church, the sentencing of such and such persons by
name, as Hymeneus and Philetus, and other Blasphemers; the Authoritative
Declaration, that such a brother is to be esteemed as a Heathen and a Publican,
and brotherly fellowship of eating and drinking with such an one denied, that
he may be ashamed, if these be, then are some debarred from the holy things of
God, by Church Censures, beside the preaching of the word of God.

But the former is true; Ergo, so is the latter.

The Proposition is proved, because all wicked persons and heart-hypocrites are
excluded from the holy things of God, by the Preaching of the Word: But only
these that are notoriously, and by testimony of witnesses, convinced to be
scandalous or contumacious in atrocious sins, after they are by name rebuked,
and are declared to be esteemed as Heathen and Publicans; and from whom we are
to withdraw brotherly fellowship, are excluded from the holy things of God, by
Discipline and Church Censures.

The Assumption I prove: Because the word is preached to all by one in office,
and that a Steward and dispenser of the mysteries of God, and he excludes all
unworthy ones known to be such, or invisible only, from the kingdom of God. But
the Censure, 1. Is inflicted by many, 2 Cor. 26. by the Church, Matthew. 18. 17.
conveened together, 1 Cor. 54. (2.) It is applied to such persons by name, 1
Cor. 5. 5. He that has done such a deed, ver. 2. Hymeneus, Alexander, 1 Timothy
1. 20. Jezabel, Rev. 2. 20. (3) The whole congregation is not to eat or Table
with such an one, 1 Cor. 5. 11. We are to note and observe him, and to have no
company with him, that he may b ashamed 2 These. 3. 14. to esteem him as an
Heathen and a Publican, and exclude him from the Seals of the Covenant, so long
as he remains in that state.

3. Arg. If a person may for not hearing the Church, be judged as an Heathen
and a Publican, and his sins bound in heaven by the Church; then by
discipline he is excluded from the holy things of God in a peculiar way, in the
which contumacious persons, uncircumcised in heart are excluded, in foro
interno Dei, in Gods secret Court; But the former is true, Matt. 18. 15. 16,
17, 18. Ergo etc. Now if there be two Courts, one before God, Romans 2. 16. Romans
14. 4. 1 Cor. 14. 25. 1 Ioh. 3. 21. Another of the Church, Mat. 18. 15. 16,
etc. 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5, 6, 11, 12. and two sorts of bindings, two sorts of
Witnesses, two sorts of Sentences, then can it not be dedenyed but the Church
has a spiritual Court for censures, as well as for preaching the Word.

4. Arg. Exclusion of an offender from the society of the Saints, and not to
eat or drink with him, is some other real visible censure accompanied with
shame, then any censure by the preaching of the Word; but there is such a
censure inflicted by the Church, Ergo, The Proposition is clear from Romans 16.
17. Now I beseech you brethren, mark them that cause divisions and offenses,
contrary to the doctrine which ye learned (...) and avoid them. Here is a
real, visible, and personal note of shame put on Schismatics, a bodily
declining and avoiding of their company, which could not possibly be done by
preaching of the Word. But (some may say) this was not done by the Church
court, but every one as private christians were to eschew the society of
Schismatics, and by this you cannot conclude any Church censure.

Answ. Not to say that it were unjustice to decline any, and renounce Eschewing
the society of scandalous church members must be a church censure.
society with him, before he were convinced to be factious according to Christ's
order, Mat. 18. which to Erastus is a way of common and natural equity. And so
in order to some public censure before the Church. Paul w^i^eth to a
constitute Church at Rome, in which he prescribes Romans 12. the Officers duty,
as what Pastor, Doctor, Elder, Deacon, ought to do in a Church body; We cannot
imagine he could command every private Christian to inflict the censure and
punishment, (for a punishment it is in order to a public sin) of avoiding any
in Church communion, professing they serve the Lord Jesus Christ, as these do,
verse 18. upon their own private opinion: Jesus Christ and his Apostles must
have left men loose in all order and discipline by this way, howbeit the
adversary would deny a church punishment, here is a punishment inflicted by
many, 2 Cor. 2. 6. And it is not inflicted by way of preaching, so 2 These. 3.
14. If any man obey not our word by this Epistle, note that man, have no
company with him, that he may be ashamed, (...) by the learned is to put a
public church note on him that he may be confounded, make him a (...), a
public wonder, that he may be ashamed, as Piscator and P. Baynes observe on
the place expounding it of excommunication, and the same word (...) that is
here, is used toward the incestuous man, who was to be excommunicated, 1 Cor.
5. 9. I wrote unto you in an Epistle, not to keep company with fornicators,
the word (...) ver. 1. is ascribed to the incestuous man, and here they are not
to be mixed (...) with fornicators, verse. 11. But now I have written unto you
not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother, be a fornicator, or
covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or an extortioner, with such a one, no
not to eat. And that we may know that this is a church censure, he adds ver.
12. For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? Ergo, this no
keeping company with such, is a Church judging.

5. Arg. The Church of Pergamus is rebuked for having amongst them, such as
hold the doctrine of Balaam, and Revel. 2. 14. and Thyatira, that they suffered
Iezabel to preach and seduce the servants of God, ver. 20. as the Church of
Ephesus is praised v. 2. that they cannot bear with them that are evil, but
had tried such that said they were* Apostles, and were not, and had found them
liars, Rev. 2. 3. Here is it clearly supposed that these churches were to
censure false teachers, if any shall say they were to censure them no other
ways, but by preaching against their errors; 1. This would establish a Prelate
above the Church contrary to that of Mat. 18. Tell the Church, and 1 Cor. 5.
Where the Church gathered together was to excommunicate. 2. The Angel of the
Church is taken collectively, for all the Rulers and the whole Church to whom
Christ writes, as is clear, in that he says so often; He that has an ear
let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches, not to the Pastors only.
2. The removing of the Candlestick, is not from the Angel but from the Church;
and repentance, and the fighting and overcomming, a reward of the crown of
life, and many other things are evidently spoken to the Churches, not to the
Angels of the Churches. And therefore the trial of false Apostles must be by a
Church, a Court, a college of church rulers, as Paul speaks unto, Act. 20.
17. Where it is said, Paul called the Elders of the Church of Ephesus, and
exhorted them to beware of false teachers, that should not spare the flock,
and should teach perverse things, v. 28. 29. 30. and of this sort were these
lying and seducing Apostles, now how can one Angel or many Pastors by
preaching only try false Apostles, and find them liars? This trying and
sentencing of lying seducers, Rev. 2. 2. must be by a court, such as we find to
be the practice of the Apostles and Elders at Jerusalem, who in a Synod Act.
15. did find these who taught a necessity of Circumcision, to be perverters
of souls and liars, saying, They had the Apostles authority for what they
taught, whereas they had no such thing, and Schismatic troublers of the
people, Acts 15. See what further I have said for Excommunication before, cap.
2. and sect. 7. which proves also the same thing. The Church of Thyatira would
not be rebuked for suffering Jezabel to teach, if they had no power of Church
censures to hinder her; It is not enough to say that the Angel of that Church
did sufficiently hinder Jezabell to teach, when in public he declared and
preached against her false doctrine, and by the same reason Pastors exoner
their conscience, if they preach that such and such scandalous persons are not
to eat and drink their own damnation, though they debar them not in a
visible court by name from the Lords table, and though they never excommunicate
them, and therefore there is not any censure but Pastoral rebukes by way of
preaching, not any other by way of discipline.

Ans. The Angel of Thyatira had not sufficiently hindered Jezabel The hindering
of Jezabel by preaching only not sufficient.
to seduce the servants of God, by only preaching against her false doctrine,
in regard that Paul and Barnabas not only hindered those that teached, that the
Gentiles ought to be circumcised, Act. 14. cap. 16. by Preaching; but also had
recourse to the power and authority of a Synod, that in a Synod which is a
Court essentially consisting of many Pastors and Elders, they might be declared
to be perverters of souls, and liars, as indeed they were judicially declared
to be such, Act. 15. 24. Hence I argue; if the Apostles could not be said
sufficiently to hinder Jezabels and Seducers, by only Preaching, and Disputing
against their errors, except in case of their persisting in their errors, they
should tell the Church convened in a Synod, as Christ's order is, Mat. 18. Then
the Angel of Thyatira, or any one Pastor do not sufficiently hinder scandals,
but may be well said to suffer them by only private rebuking and public
Preaching, except they use all these means to hinder Iezabels, false Teachers,
and all scandalous persons, that the Apostles used, and therefore the Angel of
the Church of Thyatira must be rebuked for not using the Authority and power of
the Church against Iezabel. And here by the way, when these false Teachers had
sinned against their brethren in perverting their souls, they take not the
course that Erastus dreameth to be taken according to Matthew. 18. They complain
not to the Synedrim, or Civil Magistrate, who should use the sword against
them, but to the Church Synodically convened at Jerusalem, who used against
them the Spiritual power that Christ the head of the Church had given them.

6. Arg. If there be an Ecclesiastical debarring of scandalous Debarring of
the scandalous from the seals pro^ed.
persons from the holy things of God, especially from the Supper of the Lord by
Censures, and not by the preaching of the word only, then there be Censures and
power of jurisdiction in the word beside preaching of the word. But the former
I make good by these following Arguments.

1. Arg. If the Stewards and dispensers of the mysteries of God, are to cut the
word aright as approved workmen, 2 Timothy 2. 15. And are to give every one their
portion of bread according to their need, and measure, Matthew. 24. 45, 46, 47. 1
Cor. 4. 1. 2. 3. and must not s^ay the souls which should not die, by
denouncing wrath against the righteous, nor save the souls alive that should
not live, by lying words, Ezec. 13. 19. by offering mercy to the wicked and
impenitent, then as they should not deny the seals of salvation to Believers,
hungring and thirsting for Christ; neither should they give the seals of life
to those that are walking openly in the way of destruction.

But the former is true; Ergo; so is the latter. The Proposition is clear: As
the word should not be divided aright, if wrath should be Preached to believing
Saints, and life and salvation offered to the obdurate and wicked, so neither
should the Stewards cut the seals of the word aright, if the Supper were given
to wicked men: If they should say, This is the blood of the Covenant, shed for
the Remission of your sins, Drink ye all of it: They should save alive those
that should die, with lying words; for the seals speak to the Communicant, and
apply to him in particular, the very promise that in general is made to him;
and this will prove as the Magistrate being no Steward of the word, and not
called of God thereunto, as Aaron was Heb. 5. 4. can no more distribute the
word and seals It belongs not to the Magistrate to ^ debar from the seals.
to whom he pleases, Ex officio, then he can Preach and Administer the
Sacraments, nor should another man, who is no Steward, but a Porter or Cook,
Teach, and that by his office how, and to whom the Steward should distribute
Bread: nor is it sufficient, to say, by this one man, not the Church, is to
debar from the Sacraments, for the seals being proper to the Church, as the
Church, he must act here, in, and with the power of the Church. 2. It is
another question, whether by the Minister, or by the Church any ought to be
debarred, and whether there be any such Censure as debarring from the Seals;
and its another question, by what power, whether by the power of order, or by
the power of jurisdiction, Ministers may debar the scandalous from the seals; I
conceive by both powers, they may keep the Ordinances pure; and if it belong to
the Magistrate to debar any more then to preach the word, and by the way of
Erastus: The Magistrate by his office, as he is a Magistrate only is deputed of
Jesus Christ to Steward the seals to whom he pleases: Ergo, (say I) to cut the
word aright to whom he pleases, must be his due.

2. Arg. As the dispensers of the word must not partake of other men's sins, 1 Timothy 5. 22. so neither should they distribute to wicked and scandalous men,
such Ordinances, as they see shall certainly be judgment and damnation to
them, and as makes the Communicants guilty of the body and blood of our Lord:
Now that the Stewards Communicate with the sins of these manifestly scandalous,
to whom they administrate the Supper: I prove: 1. Because they that sow pillows
under the head of the openly wicked, preaching peace to these who should die,
do hunt souls, Ezech. 13. 20. and partake of their presumption, and they that
heal the wound of the people with smooth words, are false dealers, and
concurreth to the wound of the people, Ier. 8. 10, 11. As the Prophet that
preaches lies partaketh of the peoples presumption; which believe those lies,
Ier. 14. 14, 15, 16. 2. If Eve should but reach the fruit of the forbidden Tree
to Adam, and say take and eat, she partakes of Adams sin, if the mother give
poison willingly and wittingly to a child, she kills her child, though it
be told the child that it is poison: The Supper to those who knowingly to us,
eat unworthily, is forbidden meat, and poison.

3. A third Argument is, from the nature of holy things. It is not lawful to
give that which is holy to dogs, nor to cast pearls before swine, least they
trample them under their feet, Matthew. 7. 6. But the Sacraments are holy things,
says Erastus, and no man can Thomas Erastus lib. 3. confirmat. Thesium lib. 3.
^. 3. page 207. Nam et sacramenta sub sub (...) nomine comprehendi concedo.
deny it; Ergo, we are not to give the Sacraments to the scandalous and openly
profane.

But Erastus answers, That the Lord preached the word to Pharisees, and the
word is a holy thing, and a pearl, and by Dogs, and swine, he means open
persecutors. They that will seem members of the Church, and confess their
fault, and promise amendment, are not such as will trample on the Sacraments,
and will turn again to tear you: Et si quis talis reperiatur hunc ego
admittendum minime censeo, for such (says he) Are not to be admitted to the
Sacrament.

Ans. These holy things, which profane men and openly scandalous can make no
use of, but pollute them to their own destruction, and the abusing of the
Ordinances, no more then Dogs and Swine can make use of Pearls to feed them,
but only trample on them, are not to be given to the profane and openly
scandalous: But the Lords Supper is such a thing, being Ordained only for those
that have saving Grace, not for Dogs. Now the Assumption applied to the word,
is most false, (as it is applied to the Lords Supper, it is most true) for the
Word is Ordained by special Command to be Preached to Dogs and Lions, that
thereby they may be made Isa. 11. 4, 5, 6, 7. Isa. 2. 3. 4. Lambs and Converts;
the Supper is not a mean of Conversion; and since Dogs can make no use of it,
but trample it under foot, we are forbidden to give such holy things to them.
It is true, They Will trample the Pearl of the word; but we are Commanded to
offer the word to all, even while they turn Apostates. 2. If Christ Commanded
the word to be Preached to Pharisees and Saduces; these were such persecuters
as sinned against the Holy Ghost, Dogs in the Superlative degree, Matthew. 12.
31, 32. Joh. 9. 39, 40, 41. Joh. 7. 28. Joh. 8. 21. Ergo, Christ Commanded some
holy things, the word to be given to Dogs; and yet his precept cannot be
obeyed, if we give them the Sacrament. 3. By what Doctrine of Scripture will
Erastus have these that trampleth on Ordinances, and turn again to tear us,
debarred from the Supper? For in his These. 26. 27, 28, 29. he holds it
unlawful to debar any Judas from the Supper; does he think there be no Dogs in
the Visible Church? Peter says, There be such Dogs as have known the way of
truth, and turn to their vomit; and such may promise amendment, confess their
sin, and desire the Sacrament.

4. Arg. Those who will not hear the Church, but does scandalize, not only
their Brethren, but also a whole Church, and are to be esteemed as Heathen and
Publicans, are not to be admitted to the highest privilege, and to feast with
Christ, when the Church knows they want their wedding garment: But there may
be, and are many in the Church of this sort; Ergo, such should not be admitted:
For the Major, I set down the words of Erastus granting Erastus, Confi. these.
l. 3. c. 3. page 207. Qui membra externae volunt ecclesiae videri, illi non
calcabunt Sacramenta nec offere^tem laniare tentabunt, and fiquis talis
reperiatur hune ego minime admittendum cense^.
it. The Assumption, both Scripture and experience proves; for there be in the
Visible Church, Dogs, Persecuters, Jezabels, as there be many called, and few
chosen.

5. Arg. If the incestuous man must be cast out, lest he leaven the Church,
then can he not be admitted to Communicate with the Church, in that which is
the highest seal of Christ's love; but the incestuous man must be cast out, lest
he leaven the whole Church, 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5, etc. Ergo, The Proposition is
clear, because none can be put out of the Church, but they must be separated
from the Table of the Children of the Church; the Assumption is 1 Cor. 5 13.
(...) Put him out, ver. 7. Purge him out. Now the Church has no power by
bodily violence to attempt a local separating of him in person from them, as
they are men, though they may separate themselves from him; then it must be a
declarative casting of him out, as unworthy to Communicate with the Church in
such holy Ordinances, as distinguishes the Church from other Societies, and
these be the Seals of the Covenant.

6. We are not to suffer sin in any, Levit. 18. 17. Rev. 2. 20. but to hinder
it so far as we can according to our vocation, 1 Samuel 3. 13. As the Priests
hindered Vzziah to Sacrafice, 2 Chronicles. 26. 18, 19, 20. And must pull them out of
the fire, Jude ver. 23. As the Law of nature would teach the Mother, not only,
not to cooperate with her son attempting to kill himself; but to hinder and
stop him by pulling a knife or sword out of his hand, when he is about to
destroy himself; if so, then ought not the Church and her Officers to
cooperate so far with those who do Eat and drink their own Damnation, as to
exhibit and give to such the seals of the Covenant, to pray that these seals
may be blessed to scandalons ones, which is to pray directly contrary to the
revealed will of God in his word, and against that which the faithful Pastors
and Paul Preaches, That every one should try and examine themselves, and so
eat and drink: Now a real and physical cooperating of the Church, with such
manifest impiety, must then be the Churches suffering of sin in a brother, or
not hindering him ^o eat his own Damnation; if the Lord have committed a power
of dispensing the seals to Christians, not to Pagans and Turks: Let Erastus
show any precept or practice, why we might not admit Jews, Turks, Indians,
though never Baptized, to eat and drink the Lords body and blood, (we are to
Preach the Gospel to them, if they were amongst us) except that such as are to
communicate according to the will of Christ, are Christians, members of the
Church, who does try and examine themselves; and Jews and Turks though dwelling
and born amongst us are not such, yet Erastus would that such should never be
admitted to the Lords Supper, though they should desire it: Officers also have
a command not to dispense some parts of the word to all, as we are not to
rebuke open Scorners: Should any of our Church turn Jew and blaspheme Christ,
and pertinaciously after conviction persist in his Apostasy; might not Erastus
ask by what command of Christ will ye not Preach the Gospel to such an one?
Christ made no exception, but said, Preach to all Nations, why do you make
Exceptions? might we not answer, Christ has given a power of dispensing the
Gospel to all; yet has he excepted some, because its against the will of
Christ that such can obey the Gospel: We are bidden pray for all, yet are there
some that we are not to pray for, because they sin unto death: so is the case
here in some kind.

7. It is for our instruction that the Priests were rebuked, for that they
admitted into the Sanctuary the uncircumcised in flesh and heart, that they put
no difference between the clean and the unclean, and profaned the holy
things of God, Ezekiel. 44. 9. Ezekiel. 22. 26. Hag. 2. 11, 12, 13. And this was a
shadow of things to come, as was observed before, teaching us, that far less
should the Pastors of the New Testament suffer the holy things of God to be
profaned.

8. We read that John Baptist and the Apostles baptized none but such as
confessed their sins, and professed ^aith in Jesus Christ, it would then
appear to be the will of Christ, that every one should not be admitted to the
Lords Supper, though some say, the Apostles baptized single persons not in
Church communion, so that Pastors administer the Sacraments by reason of the
power of order, as they are Pastors, not by power of jurisdiction, as having
warrant from any Church, in regard Churches at the beginning had the Word and
Sacraments before they had any Church Government, yet I conceive the Lords
Supper is a Seal of a Churchcommunion, 1 Cor. 10. 16. 17. and the like I say
of Baptism typed by Noah's Arc, 1 Pet. 3. 19, 20, etc. and though the
Apostles, partly by privilege, partly through necessity, the parts existing
before the whole, were necessitated first to baptize, and then to plant
Churches, yet the Churches being once constitute, these are* Church privileges
to be dispensed both by the power of order, and the power of jurisdiction.

CHAP. VI.
Quest. 2.
Some special Reasons of Thomas Erastus against Excommunication, examined.

THomas Erastus a Physician, who meddled not much with Divinity, save in this,
in which he was unsound, in his reply to Beza labors to make Excommunication
a dream, and nothing but a device of Pastors affecting domination. Confirmati^
Thosium Erast. Cons^^. these. l. 1. c. 1. p. 72.


1. Object. Only Pet^r killed Ananias; only Paul excommunicated Alexander and
Hymeneus, only Paul said he would come to the Corinthians with the rod, and
for a long time only Bishops excommunicated, Presbyters gave advise only.
Ergo* This power is not in the Church.

Ans.* The consequence is naught, Christ said only to his Disciples in person,
Go teach and Baptize, Is it a good consequence therefore, that none has power
to teach and Baptize, but only the Apostles? Only Paul exhorted the
Corinthians, to mourn for the incestuou^ man's fall, therefore no Pastors have
power to exhort in the like kind. 2. We grant the Apostles did many things out
of their Apostolic power, which in a constitute Church, the Church only may
do, as Paul his alone disputed against Circumcision of the Gentiles, Act. 15.
2. What? Ergo, Paul in a Synod, and a Synod has not power to dispute and
determine the same, the contrary is evident, Act. 15. 12, 22, 23. 3. It is
false that the Authority and rod, with which Paul said he would come to the
Coriuthians, 2 Cor. 10. 8. was proper only to Paul an Apostle, the same he
gives to Timothy, and to all the Elders. 3. If Bishops exercised the same
power for many ages, Erastus must show us Bishops who could kill miraculously,
such as Ananias and Elimas, and work miracles; now beside that, Erastus must
with his new opinion, hold up a new creature called a Prelate, unknown to the
Apostles or Jerome and the Fathers, he must parallel Bishops for working of
miracles to Paul and the Apostles. Erast. will have no man excluded from the
Sacraments page 86. Si per subductionem pabuli intelligis verbi aut
sacramentorum negationem, de tu^ hoc dicis, non l^queris cum scripturis, quae
nusquam jubent pabula haec subducere.


Obj. 2. The Apostles declared many to be excluded out of the kingdom of
heaven, and so bound in heaven whom they did not excommunicate from the
Sacraments, so also do the Ministers daily, and yet Christ in his word
commanded not those to be debarred from the Lords Supper.

Ans. It is very true, the Apostles and Pastors of Christ that now are,
denounce eternal wrath, and that authoritatively against those that are
invisibly to men heart-hypocrites, who yet before the Church (who know not the
heart) go for Saints, and are neither excluded from Sacraments, nor so much as
rebuked. But it is a vain collection, that therefore externally scandalous are
not to be debarred from the Supper, and Excommunicated: The Prophets, 1 Cor.
14. did preach that Heathens remaining Heathens were excluded out of the
Kingdom of God; yet Heathens cannot be Excommunicated; and yet (I hope) Erastus
dare not deny, but Christ has forbidden, that Heathen remaining Heathen be
admitted to the Sacraments: Though I dare provoke any Erastian, and attest them
by their new Doctrine, to show me a warrant from Christ's Testament, why the
Church should refuse the Seals to a Turk; they will say, A Turk is not willing
to receive, and therefore the Seals According to Erastus his way we cannot deny
the seals to a Turk.
may be denied to him, and yet cannot be denied to a member of the Church
though scandalous, if he desire it, and profess repentance.

But I answer, Though a Turk be unwilling to receive the Seals; What if he
should be willing, and require to be Baptized, yet remaining ignorant of Christ
and the Gospel we should not Baptize him: Now by the Doctrine of Erastus, we
have no more re warrant to deny the seals to him, then to deny them to Judas;
we desire a Scripture from the adversary, which will not conclude with equal
strength of reason against the giving of the seals to any scandalous member of
the Church; it is true, a Turk ignorant of Christ, though he should desire the
seals is incapable, and he is unwilling vertually, in regard he as yet refuses
the knowledge of the Gospel, and so is the scandalous professor no less
incapable (though we may grant degrees of incapacity) for he is vertually
unwilling to receive Christ in regard he is unwilling to part with his
idol-sins: 2. Though a Turk should be unwilling (as its like enough he will be)
yet we desire a Scripture, why we cannot make offer of the Sacraments to a
Turk, and yet we may Preach the Gospel and make offer of Christ in the word to
him, 1 Cor. 14. 23. And this Scripture shall also conclude, we are not to admit
scandalous persons to the Sacraments, being both incapable of them, as also
because they can but trample on these pearls,, no less then the Turk should
do; the Argument then is just nothing: We exclude many from the Kingdom of
Heaven, whom we do not excommunicate on earth; But he should say, we
Excommunicate many, whom we do not exclude out of Heaven.

Erastus. These two are not one, to declare a person hateful in P. 75, 76.
Heaven to God, and to be cast out of the visible Church; for if they be both
one, then one private Pastor may Excommunicate, for he may declare from Gods
word, that an offender is excluded out of Heaven: has not the word of God in
the mouth of one as much authority and power as out of the mouth of many? the
authority of the word depends not on a multitude, also why should this be as
good a consequence (God judges not this man worthy of the Kingdom of God;
Ergo, he is to be cast out of the visible Church) as this (God judges not this
man worthy of life eternal: Ergo, God will not have him to live in this
temporal life) Are we ignorant that God esteems many not worthy of life
eternal, to whom he has given power to cast out devils Toexclude men from the
Kingdom of Heaven not one with Excommunication
in his name? Matthew. 7.

Ans. All this is but with carnal reason to speak against the ways of God;
for 1. Not every denouncing of a sinner unworthy of Heaven is Excommunication:
So Judas might have Excommunicated himself, and when one Pastor declares an
offender unworthy of Heaven; he is not formally excommunicated out of the
visible Church; he is cast out of the invisible Church: But that is not
Excommunication, except it be done for a public scandal that offends the
Church: 2. Except it be done by the visible Church. 3. According to the rule of
Christ, Matthew. 18. 4. That he may be ashamed, and repent and be saved: Gods
binding of the offender in Heaven, is a part of Excommunication, but not all,
nor the very same with Excommunication. 2. The Churches casting out for Christ's
institutions cause, is of more Authority then the Conscionall casting out
performed by one Pastor, and yet the Conscional casting out by one, insuo
genere is as valid as the other, subordinata non pugnant. 3. We are not to take
our compass and rule of Gods ways by his outward dispensation, but the
revealed will of Christ is our Rule, God thinks those who walks
inordinately, and causes divisions, not worthy of the Christian society of
the Saints; and must bind them in heaven to that censure, in regard he
expressly so commands in his Word, Romans 16, 17. 18. 2 These. 3. 14, 15. 1 Cor.
5. 11. Yet he thinks them worthy of Salvation, and may give repentance and
Jesus Christ to many of these; he may deny salvation to the wicked, and upon
that feed them to the day of slaughter, dare flesh and blood quarrel this
consequence? God has appointed the wicked for the day of wrath. Ergo, he
gives them more of this life then heart can wish. This consequence depends
on the mere dispensation of God, nor is this our Consequence. God judges such
unworthy of heaven; Ergo, they must be cast out of the visible Church, we never
made Excommunication a necessary consequent of the Lords judging men unworthy
of Heaven, for then all these that God judges unworthy of life eternal should
be excommunicated, and only these, which is false; for God may judge some
worthy of life eternal in Christ, and yet they are to be excommunicated, if
they refuse to hear the Church, as many regenerate may go that sar in
scandalous obstinacy, and many whom God judges unworthy of life eternal, may
so belie a Profession, as they deserve not to be excommunicated, and both these
may fall out, and do fall out according to the revealed will of Christ.

Erastus 4. objecteth. Excommunication must exclude men from Page 78.
only the external society of the Church, for he only can join us to Christ,
or separate us from internal and spiritual society of Christ, who can beget
lively faith in us, and extinguish lively faith when it is begotten, for by
faith only we are made living members of Christ's body, and by only infidelity
we leave off to be members of his body: But no Church, no creatures can either
beget lively faith in us, or extinguish it in us: or thus, men can neither give
to us, nor take from us salvation, therefore Excommunication should not be
defined by cutting men off from salvation.

Ans. This is the only Argument of Erastus, that seems to Excommunication is
no real separation of one from Christ's invisible body.
bear weight; But it is false and groundless, it supposes the false principle
that Erastus goes on, that Excommunication is a real separation of a member
from Christ's Invisible and Mystical body, and that the Excommunicated person
who may be an Invisible member of Christ, and regenerated, may be an Apostate,
and fall from Christ, and leave off to be a member. The contrary of which all
our Protestant Divines teach against Papists; whereas, Excommunication is only
a Declarative; but withal, an Authoritative Act or Sentence of the Church, and
no real cutting off of a believer from Christ: But you will say, It
presupposes a cutting off in heaven from Christ; and therefore the
Excommunicated person is declared to be cut off. Let me Answer, I conceive
Excommunication has neither Election nor Reprobation, Regeneration or
non-Regeneration, for its object, or terminus, but only it cutteth a
contumacious person off from the Visible Church on earth, and from the head
Christ in heaven, not in regard of his state of Regeneration, as if Christ
ratifying the Sentence in heaven, did cut him off so much as conditionally from
being a member of his body: No, but in regard of the second Acts of the life of
God, and the sweet efficacy and operation of the spirit, by which the
Ordinances are less lively, less operative, and less vigorous, the man being
as the Learned and Reverend Mr. Cotton says, As a palsy Member, in which life
remains, but a little withered and blunted, and he in Satan's power to ve^ his
spirit, and therefore I grant all, to wit, that Excommunication is not a real
separating of a member from Christ's body, only unbelief does that; but it
follows not, Ergo, it is a separation only from the external society of the
Church: For 1. This external cutting off, is ratified in heaven: And 2. Christ
has ratified it by a real internal suspension of the influence of his spirit
in heaven: But I deny that this universal does follow from Christ's binding in
heaven, That whomever God judges unworthy of heaven, all these are to be cast
out of the Church; he cannot prove this consequence from our grounds.

Erastus Argues thus: If God dam any as a sinner in heaven, he Page 79.
will have the Elders to cast him out of the Church Visible in earth, so they
know him to be such; yet this is not sure.

Ans. It is most sure, so all the Church know him (Elders only Iudicially
Excommunicate, the people also by consent, and by Execution of the Sentence,
and avoiding the offender) and if it be Iudicially proved, the Church is to
Excommunicate. But 1. he must not be without the Church, 1 Cor. 5. 12. Though
the Church know Turks and Pagans, and those who live without Christ, to be
damned in heaven; yet they Excommunicate them not, for they are without the
Church, 1 Cor. 5. 12. and yet damned, Act. 4. 12. 2. They may know many
unregenerated, Ioh. 15. 18. Yet they cannot Excommunicate them for
non-regeneration, or non* election to glory, which they cannot know judicially,
except they be externally scandalous, Matthew. 18. 17. 1 Cor. 5. 1. 2.

Erastus, By Preaching, Drunkards are excluded out of Heaven, P. 81, 82.
and God declares by the Preaching of the word, that they are not of the
faithful on earth; but you cannot prove these four from Scripture. 1. That God
has Commanded to cast them out of the Church, whom he has judged unworthy of
life Eternal. 2. That they should not be admitted to the Sacrament, who have
polluted themselves with some sin, though they say they repent, except it
please the Elders. 3. That it is Gods will that they ^e debarred from the
Sacrament, by the voices of a Court of Elders. 4. That God has Commanded such
a Court of Elders under a Christian Magistrate, who should have a power of
jurisdiction, different from the power of the Magistrate.

Ans. 1. Declaring by Preaching, that a Drunkard is not of the number of the
faithful in the Visible Church, is materially Excommunication: This Erastus
says, We want only a Court of Elders: But how proves he that one Pastor
should cast out of the Church by Preaching, all those that God judges unworthy
of life eternal. Erastus says, A Presbytery cannot do this: 1. Because the
heart is known to God only, page 83. And does one single Pastor know the heart,
and a Senate of Pastors knows it not? 2. Must Pastors know the heart, which
God only knows, 2 Chronicles. 29, 30. Ier. 17. 10. Otherwise they cannot
judicially Excommunicate, and one Pastor may by way of Preaching,
Excommunicate, and yet he knows not the heart. 3. For the first of his four,
we need not prove it, we assert it not. 4. Though a Turk or an Apostate should
say that he repents, yet he lies; and Erastus says, l. 3. cap. 3. page 207.
Hunc ego minime admittendum censeo. I think such a one is not to be admitted to
the Sacrament. 5. What Christ says, Matthew. 18. we take to be Gods will. 6. If
there were no Christian Magistrate, belike a Church-Court might excommunicate;
and shall the Magistrate, because Christian, spoil the Church of the power she
had while she wanted a Magistrate? 7. The power of Excommunicating, and binding
and loosing in earth and heaven, must then be principally in the Magistrate:
And who gave the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven to the Magistrate?

Erastus. If Excommunication be a cutting off from Salvation: then all who are
Excommunicated must perish; But many Excommunicated persons are saved, many
relaxed are Condemned.

Ans. We define not so Excommunication: Nor did Beza put men's Salvation in
hazard, because they are Excommunicated so they repent, if their sins be
retained in Heaven, and they never repent. Let Erastus see how they shall be
saved. 2. Those against whom one Pastor denounces the just deserved wrath of
God, are Conscionally cut off from Salvation: But many of those are saved. Let
Erastus Answer this himself.

Erastus. He only can cast out of the Church who sees the heart; Page 83.
But men, or the Church, sees not the heart; Ergo, men can do no more but
debar from the Sacraments: It is not enough to say, that whom they cast out, as
the Ambassadors of God in the name of Christ, declaring those to be bound on
earth, whom Christ has bound in heaven are excommunicated: for the Argument is
not, whether Pastors may pro^ounce on earth, that which God has ratified in
Heav^n; but whether they may so cast out of the Church, as they may cut men off
from Salvation; and whether one Pastor may not do this, no less then a
Presbytery.

An^. So I may Argue a Prophet cannot warn a wicked man, that he shall dye
eternally* because a Prophet in ordinary, knows not the heart more then a
Senate of prophets, yet are all prophets to exclude from Salvation, wicked and
impenitent men, but conditionally, so they repent not, in which God goes
before them, Ezech. 3. 18, 19, 20. Cap. 33. 6, 7. Act. 20. 20. Nor are we to
doubt, but all Prophets to the end of the world must do the same. 2. If men
debar from the Sacraments, as having warrant from Christ, they do also exclude
men from Christ and Salvation offered in the Word; and is there not need that
Pastors see the heart, if they exclude men from Christ and Salvation in the
Word and Seals, as from Salvation simply? And how can men know binding in
Heaven, more then the hearts of men on earth? The one is as far from our
intuitive knowledge, as the other, except that we know both by fruits and
effects; otherwise, this is but a Popish Argument, if the Church do bind on
earth, as God binds in Heaven, say Stapleton, Becanus, Suarez, and other
Papists; then must the Church be infallible in judgment: But we deny the
Consequence in the one, as in the other. 2. It is that which offends Erastus,
1. That a Senate, not one man does this. 2. That the Christian Magistrate does
it not: But I pray you, does one Pastor, or the Christian Magistrate know the
heart; but a Presbytery cannot do it, because a Presbytery knows not the
heart: Is not this too partial Logic?

Erastus. Many Excommunicated persons have repented in the end Page 86.
of their life, and dyed devoutly; then he who is cast out of the Visible
Society of the Church, is not cast out of the internal and spiritual Society
of Christ.

Ans. This is as much against Christ's words, as against us; may not many whose
sins are bound in heaven, and against whom the Pastors denounce exclusion out
of heaven, repent in the end of their life, and die devoutly? Ergo, The very
threatenings of the Gospel must be wind* and by these, none are excluded from
Heaven. 2. Excommunication is but a conditional excluding out of Heaven* if
men repent, the condition not being placed, Nihil ponitur in esse, they are
saved; though it may fall out that they want the external relaxation of the
Church, not through their own fault, but by some external providence
insuperable to them.

But it is to beg the Question, to say, Those that are justly Excommuniated,
and seek not to be reconciled to the Church, do repent and die devoutly. Beza
says, Pastors should give food to the hungry sheep, though they know not the
moment when they do repent. Erastus Replyeth, Then give Word and Sacraments to
those who seek them.

Ans. This is more Charity then the Scripture knows, belike Erastus will have
all those that seek God daily, and delight to know his ways, and ask for the
Ordinances of Justice, and take delight in approaching to God, to be all hungry
souls, hungring for Righteousness, and so blessed, Matthew. 5. 6. Luke 1. 52.
Isa. 55. 1. Whereas Isaiah says, They may do all that, and be but plaistred
Hypocrites, Isa. 58. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Erastus. But if the Excommunicated man repent, whether soon or late, he was
never cut off from inward communion with Christ, for then the elect might
perish; if David and Manasseh had been excommunicate, and died, they had been
saved, except we deny the perseverance of the Saints.

Ans. Erastus evidenceth, he has little skill in Divinity, he thinks a
regenerate man not capable of Excommunication, why? and the sad falls of David,
Peter and others prove, they may fall in as great sins, as not hearing of the
Church 2. If one repent in his death, as the repenting Thief, will that infer
he was never all his life separated from Christ? The contrary is true and
clear in the Ephesians. 2. 1^, 12, 13. Tit. 3. 3. ^ Tim. 1. 13, 14, 15. 3. This is
as strong (as it is weak as water) against all the threatenings denounced
against such sinners as the Lord gisteth with Repentance, for Excommunication
to the regenerated is a sort of Evangelick conditional threatening.

Erastus. To give internal communion with Christ is a spiritual Page 88. 8^
thing, Ergo, The Church cannot take it from any, and that same power that
gives, takes away, then the Presbytery cannot by loosing, give salvation, nor
by binding, take it away. Excommunication on earth is nothing, except God bind
first in heaven, then it is but a declaration of what God does, to show the
sentence that another judge has given out, is not to judge; there is a
difference between those that by authority give out a sentence, and those who
as servants does promulgate the sentence. So Luther tom. German. 1. fol. 239.
Excommunicare non est, ut quidam opinantur, animam Satanae tradere, and precum
fructu a piis factarum spoliare. Nam ubi vera fides and charitas in cord
remanent, etiam vera communio Dei, and precum Christianitatis fructus
permanent, postquam aliud est excommunicatio, nec fieri aliud potest, quam
privatio externi Sacramenti, ac commercii cum hominibus ac si in custodiam
traditus externa amicorum consuetudine priver, amore and favore eorum interea
non spolier.

Ans. This is but the old argument of Erastus, repeated almost a hundred times
to please the people. We never taught that either Presbytery or Minister can
give, or take away inward Communion with God. But hence it will not follow,
that Excommunication is an empty thing, for all we do is but, a Ministry,
Christ does make the whole Gospel, promises, threatening, Sacraments,
effectual, else, What is Paul? What is Apollo? but the Ministers by whom ye
believe? And what is the planting of Paul, or the watering of Apollo, except
God give the increase? If this anull Excommunication, because Excommunicators
are not properly judges, but only Servants and Heralds to declare what Christ
does in Heaven, then may Erastus prove that the Word, Promises, threatenings of
the Gospel; The Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors, Teachers are nothing, for all
of themselves are mere declarations of Gods will. 2. Those who Excommunicate
because they judge not, Though Excommunication be only declarative, yet it is
not empty.
but declare the will of Christ, they are not for that void of all authority,
for their declaration is authoritative. What did Jeremiah but declare Gods
will, yet it is such a prophetical and authoritative declaration, as I
conceive Baruch or any other not sent as a Prophet of God, could not bear that
which God puts on Jeremiah, c. 1. 10. See, I have this day set thee over the
Nations, and over the Kingdoms to root out, and to pull down, to destroy, and
to pull down, to build and to plant: Has Jeremiah no Prophetical authority
over the Nations and Kingdoms to whom he prophesies in the Name of the Lord,
to build and destroy, to root out, and to plant, because he declares and
prophesies, that such Nations shall be destroyed and rooted out for their
wickedness, and such shall be builded and planted? Then mere declaration says
nothing against Excommunication; Paul, says he, and the rest of the Apostles
were nothing but Ministers, 1 Cor. 3. 5. and yet authority they had, else he
could not say, 2 Cor. ^0. 6. We have in readiness vengeance against all
disobedience, Verse 8. For though I should boast somewhat more of our
Authority, etc. I should not be ashamed, and 2 Cor. 5. 20. Now then we are
Ambassadors for Christ, but I pray you 1 Cor. 12. 29. Are all Apostles? Are all
Prophets? Are all Teachers?

3. What Luther says is true, Excommunication can put none out of the state of
saving Faith and inward Communion with God, nor does deprive men of the fruit
of the Prayers of the godly, for the godly pray that Excommunication may be
medicine effectually blessed of God, for the saving of the man's soul, yea, Gods
not hearing of the prayers of the godly, praying in a Church way, that he may
be humbled, is a mean to humble the cast out man, nor is the man delivered to
Satan morally to be hardened; but judicially and withal medicinally to be
softened, that his spirit may be saved. Nor is the Church to hate him, but to
admonish him as a brother, 2 These. 3. 15. And he is so deprived of the
external society and means, as the operation of the ordinances is suspended.

Erastus. If any should die in their typical uncleanness, were they Cap. 2.
l. 1. p. 93.
so Excommunicated, that their salvation was in hazard?

Ans. Not, so they repented: What then? Ergo, Excommunication was not ratified
in Heaven, it follows not.

Erastus. Beza says, Those that were morally polluted with heinous sins, were
more unclean then those who were typically only unclean: Ergo, They should be
far rather excluded from the holy things of God.

Erastus answers, If God had commanded them to be punished with the same
punishment, and not with diverse; it would follow, that those that are morally
impure, should rather be debarred then the other.

Ans. But the Ceremonial uncleanness was punished so to signify Gods
detestation of moral uncleanness, and how hateful they were, who would
multiply sacrifices, and yet had hands full of blood, Esa. 1. And who would
steal, murder, whore, and yet come and stand before God in his house, and cry,
The Temple of the Lord are these, Ier. 7. 49. And that God punished the one
with heavier plagues then the other, is much for us, that adulterers far more
and the uncircumcised in heart were to be holden out of the Sanctuary, as the
Lord says, Ezech. 44. 7, 8, 9. then those who were only uncircumcised in flesh.

Erastus. Those that morally sinned, were not debarred from the holy things,
because they were invited to come and offer sacrifice for their sins.

Ans. And because they might not enter into the Temple, while the Priests
offered a sacrifice for them, they were no less excluded from the holy things
of God, then an Excommunicated person is, while the Church see him swallowed up
of grief, and do relaxe and forgive, 2 Cor. 2. 6, 7, 8, 9. Is this a good
Argument? The Excommunicate person is invited to come again, that the Church
may pardon, then it will follow he was cast out.

Erastus. Paul forbids to eat with fornicators, 1 Cor. 5. It shall never
follow that they are worthy of holy convention that are worthy of a common
Table, and that they are unvvorthy of the Supper, who are unworthie of a common
Table, they were debarred from a familiar Communion with the godly: 1. That
they might be ashamed: 2. Least they should infect them; Paul says, be not
mixed with them (...) but he says not, exclude them from the Lords Table, and
other holy things: In the Sacrament I must try my self, not others; in my
familiar Tabling with others, I am to try them, that I may gain them; yea, 2
These. 3. Though we are to eschew familiar conversing with those that walk
unorderly, yet are we to keep communion in holy things with them, and to
admonish them as brethren.

Ans. Erastus propounds an Argument of his own, 1 Cor. 5. in place of ours; we
said never that they that are unworthy of the holy Supper, are unworthy to be
Tabled with in common familiarity, as brethren, though that be most true: But
we reason thus, Those that are to be delivered to Satan, and cast out, as, 1
Cor. 5. 5, 13. of the Church, and judged, ver. 12. and with whom we may not
eat, ver. 11. These are not to be admitted to the Lords Supper, which is the
proper feast of the Church: But such are all incestuous and scandalous persons,
and therefore Paul does indeed command them to be excluded from the holy feast.
2. To say the Church and her Officers must try themselves, not others, ere they
come to the Lords Supper, is to beg the question, for ere they be admitted into
the Sanctuary, they are to be tried, whither they be uncircumcised in heart and
flesh, or not, Ezekiel. 44. 7, 8, 9. Ezekiel. 22. 26. As we have proved. 3. Paul not
only uses a passive verb, be not mixed with them, but 1 Cor. 5. 5. he uses
four active words, v. 5. (...), 2. v. 7. (...) purge him out. 3. v. 12. He
wills them (...) to judge him* 4. He says, (...), put away that evil one.

Hence I argue, The men whom they convened together were Putting out 1 Cor. 5.
Excommunicating.
to judge, to deliver to Satan, to purge out, to put away (...) out of the
midst of them, ver. 2. or from amongst them, v. 13. This man they did
Authoritatively either put from amongst them, as they were Christians, from
their common Table, or out of their fellowship, as they were men, to kill him,
Or 3. out of their Church Communion, that they should not keep the feast of the
Lords Supper with them: Let Erastus give a fourth: now we cannot dream of the
first two: for 1. Would the Apostle command a Church-meeting, to interdict a
man of Tabling with them in common eating and drinking? What needs a
Church-court, for they were (...), when they did this? And what needed a
judging Court for this? for, not to eat with him, was no censure of the Church,
as Erastus says. 2. It is no Grammar, nor can it bear sense, that the
Corinthians could say, we Corinthians gathered together in the name and power
of the Lord Jesus, do cast out such a one out of the midst of us, that is, from
our common-Table, this would say, they had all one common Table; and that all
the Church of Corinth met at this time to some Feast, to cast him out of their
Love Feasts; a dream no man ever conceived.

3. The Text speaks of eating in their houses: could they cast the man out of
his own house, and from his own Table? they had no power so to do. But ye will
say, they might forbid any brother to go into this man's house to his Table:
True, but this was not to put the man out of the midst of them, as Paul says.
Nor fourthly, was Paul's spirit, and the name and power of the Lord Jesus
required for eschewing of a common Table with this man.

Erastus says, Paul commanded this, Romans 16. 17. 2 These. 3. 14, 15. To all and
every believer at Rome, and Thessalonica by themselves. Nor 2. were they to
kill him: Never did a Church conveen to kill a man. This is so insolent that
Erastus must give precept for it, or a practice beside the present case:
therefore here must be some Church out-casting.

4. Though Paul will have us admonish a cast out man as a brother, 2 These. 3.
Its private admonition that I owe to all men, Lev. 19. 17. And that one woman
is to perform to another, Col. 3. 15. But not any of the holy things of the
Sanctuary.

Erastus. The Jews accused Paul of nothing, but that they lied that he brought
Greeks into the Temple. The Law bad all the clean eat the Passover, and
excepteth none for their wickedness, Christ admitted Judas to the Passover,
and said, Drink ye all of this. Paul recites a Catologue of wicked men in
Corinth, 1 Cor. 5. With whom we are not to have private dealing, but he
commands never to exclude any who are willing to come, from the Lords Supper:
We are to try our selves, not one another, nor is it a sin to eat at the Lords
Table with wicked men.

Ans. Belike it was a crime then to bring the Greeks into the Temple: 2. It is
a begging of the question to say, all were admitted to the Passover: See how
this is before answered. 3. Christ admitted Judas into the Passover; What
then? may Timothy lay hands suddenly on all he knows to be Iudases, that they
come in and lap the blood of souls? contrary to 1 Timothy 3. Christ is above the
Law, and if his practice in this were the rule, because Christ admitted Judas
whom he knew to be a Traitor, and did eat ordinarily at Table with him, and
committed the flock to such a known wolf. We are also to eat with covetous
extortioners, which Paul forbids, 1 Cor. 5. 11. And we are to commit the
flock of God to known Wolves, where we have a precept on the contrary, 2 Timothy
2. 2. Christ would rather teach that we are to admit to the seals all not
ignorant and scandalous, and not be too curious in striking up a window in the
conscience of others: 4. Paul's practice at Corinth is but a negative ex
particulari, and not concludent: The heathen came to hear the word at Corinth,
1 Cor. 14. 23. And Paul does no where command the Heathen should be excluded
from the Sacraments: Will Erastus then have them admitted? 5. When Paul says,
that unworthy Communicants were guilty of the Lords body and blood, and
required fidelity in the Stewards, 1 Cor. 4. He takes for confessed,
scandalous persons should not be admitted by the Church; its true, the sin of
others who communicate unworthily, is not the sin of another
fellow-communicant, who has not authority to debar his fellow-communicant.

Erastus. The Scripture debarred no Jews of old, neither from sacrifices, Lib.
^. c. 2. page 103.
nor other sacraments, but commands that all the male children, Jews or
Strangers, that were not legally unclean, nor from their homes, should thrice a
year appear before the Lord in Jerusalem, for to partake of the holy things of
God; Ergo, None were Excommunicated from the holy things of God, for moral
wickedness.

Ans. Erastus counts this an Argument that cannot be Answered; but it Answers
it self to me: And Erastus proposes a Whether Erastus does prove that none
were excluded amongst the Jews from the Sacraments for Moral uncleanness.
Law that is Catholic to all the males; yet he makes it not Catholic
himself, but propounds a number of males that are excepted, as he excepteth
those that were legally unclean, those that are from home: and yet, Deuteronomy. 16.
16. Exodus 23. 17. Exodus 34. 23. in the Letter of the Law, there is no such
exception as Erastus makes: I hope if he make an exception, so may we,
according to the word of God.

Though we should give, but not grant, that there was no Excommunica^ion
amongst the Jews, but only for Ceremonial uncleanness; yet it proves not,
there is no Excommunication in the Christian Church, but the contrary; for if
for touching the dead by Gods Law, men were separated from the holy things; in
that Church, far more, for Moral uncleanness, are men to be separated from
the holy things of God under the New Testament, for undeniably Ceremonial
separation signified and typed out Moral separation, Col. 2. 21. 2. What
ground Erastus has to except those that were Ceremonially unclean, and so as
uncircumcised in flesh, that they were not to appear before the Lord, (let him
show the Letter of Scripture for it,) the same ground have we to show that the
uncircumcised in heart are not to appear before the Lord, Ezekiel. 44. 7, 8, 9.
Ezekiel. 22. 26. Nor shall I think God would both command all the male without
exception, to compeare before him thrice a year, whether they were Adulterers,
Thieves, Murderers, Idolaters, or not such: but truly sanctified and holy; and
that he would expressly rebuke the Males that were Adulterers, Thieves,
Murderers, Idolaters, because they compeared for him in his House, Ier. 7. 8,
9, 10. So then as he commands the the Males to compeare, except they be
legally unclean, or Lepers, and would rebuke them, if they should appear
before him being Ceremonially unclean; and therefore in that case God would
have them not to come. So also, if they should be Morally unclean, he would
have them not to come, that is, it is not their sin, that they appear before
the Lord, quoad substantiam actus, but their obedience, but it is their sin
that they appear ^ali m^do, in their unrepented guiltiness, yet is it the
sin of the Priests in not differencing between the clean and the unclean,
that they suffer them to come tali modo, that as Swine they pollute the holy
things of God, to the Male it is their sin, that they come so, and so guilty;
and that they come not, it is their sin, but to the Priests it is their
sin, that they admit the unclean, and cast Pearls to Dogs. But as God would
not rebuke unworthy Eaters at the Lords Table, 1 Cor. 11. if they might eat
unworthily by Gods Law, so neither would he rebuke Thieves and Murderers for
appearing before him in his Temple, if they ought not, by Law, not to appear
in that state. No doubt (says Erastus) page 106. there were many wicked
persons in the time of Joshua, Judges, and the Kings, in such a multitude, yet
they were bidden all to compeare before the Lord, and none are excepted for
their wickedness, and it is certain God would not both bid them compeare and
not compeare.

Ans. All that sinned in Israel were bidden offer Sacrifice, yet those who are
wicked, as Sodom, are expressly debarred from Sacrifices, except they were
morally clean, Esai. 1. 13. Bring me no more vain oblation, incense is an
abomination unto me, -- 16 Wash you, make you clean. So say I here, God said
expressly, Ier. 7. 9, 10. Except you be washed from your lying, stealing, come
not before me to stand in my house, to profane my holy Name. Ergo, the Morally
unclean are excommunicated from those holy things, so all the wicked by the
same reason were forbidden, they remaining in their wickedness, without
Repentance, to eat the Passover, yea, to take the Name of God in their mouth,
Psalm. 50. 16, 17. to Sacrifice, Esai. 66. 3. to touch the Altar of God, except
their hands were washed in innocence, Psalm. 26. 6. And the Priests had the
charge of the house of God, to put difference between the clean, and the
unclean, and the Priests are said to violate the holy things of God, if the
wicked as well as the Ceremonially unclean were not debarred, Hag. 2. 11, 12.
Ezekiel. 22. 25, 26. Ezekiel. 44. 7, 8, 9. and certainly, the Males that were Leapers
were expressly excepted, and forbidden to come in the Congregation of Gods
people, as is before proved.

Erastus. The Pharisees and Sadduces debarred none from the Sacraments for
their wicked life.

Ans. What? will Erastus make the Pharisees practice our Rule, they killed the
Lord of Glory, and then eat the Passover with bloody hearts and hands: Is such
a Practice our Rule?

Erastus. John Baptist refused Baptism to none willing to be baptized, and
referred the inward Baptism, by the Spirit and fire to Jesus Christ.

Ans. John baptized those who confessed their sins, and professed their
Repentance; and the like we crave of those that are admitted to the other
Sacrament. And the instance of John or an Apostles baptizing, cannot warrant
the Baptizing of all Murderers, Idolatrous persons, or the wickedst living, as
Erastus says, and the vildest on earth, if they should but desire Baptism,
and give no confession of their Faith, nor profession of their Repentance.

Erastus. Christ who rebuked many abuses, and cast the buyers and sellers out
of the Temple, would have rebuked the pollution of the Sacraments also; but
that he never did: and Christ said that Peter should forgive his offending
Brother often in one day, if he but say, It repents me: and he says, This
transaction shall be ratified in heaven. Will you be more cruel then God? Do
not we often lie to God in our Confession to God? He means well, who desires
to come to the Supper: Be not Judges of men's Conscience.

Ans. Christ Commanding not to cast Pearls to Swine, and scourging out those
that polluted that Temple that was a type of his body, does Argue clearly, that
the holy things of God should not be profaned: But that Christ rebuked all
abuses in the worship A twofold forgiveness.
of God, in particular, Erastus cannot say. 2. It is one thing to forgive our
brother, by putting away private grudge, and a church-pardoning in the name of
Christ is another; in the former sense we are to forgive our enemy, though he
repent not, Mat. 6. 12. 14, 15. Romans 12. 19, 20. Luke 23. 34. But this
forgiveness, Luke 17. is not said to be ratified in heaven; for God does not
always forgive when we forgive, God does forgive when the sinner repents.
Erastus will have a lying confession ratified in Heaven. 3. When the Church in
Christ's Name forgiveth not upon words and lies; but upon Visible Testimonies of
repentance, they are no more Judges of the heart, then Isaiah when he said,
Except ye believe, ye shall not be established: and Paul when he said to the
Jailer* Believe and thou shall be saved: for without more then lying words of
mouth, yea, without true lively faith; neither could the one be established,
nor the other saved.

Erastus. When Paul dehorteth the Corinthians to eat things Sacrificed Page 117.
to Idols, in the Idols Temple, because they could not be partakers of the
Table of the Lord, and of the Table of Devils; he bids them not forsake the
Supper of the Lord, but only not to go to the Feast of Idols; because the
Supper, and these Tables of Devils are inconsistant; therefore he says, I will
not have you to have fellowship with Devils; but he says not, I will not have
you to come to the Supper of the Lord; nor death he bid them approve their
repentance ^re they come to some (I know not what) Presbyters. And in this
place he speaks of an external Communion, as the purpose and words prove;
because he speaks of Israel according to the flesh. 3. Because those that eat
things Sacrificed to Idols, were persuaded there was no difference between
those meats, and other meats.

Ans. Erastus his Argument is this, being reduced to form; is, if Paul say not,
1 Cor. 10. I will not have you come to the Lords Supper; but only, I will not
have you to have fellowship with the Devil in his Table; then he will have none
debarred by the Elders from the Lords Supper: But the latter is true. I deny
the Proposition, it is a connection, that one who takes on him to refute such a
precious and eminent divine as Theod. Beza, may be ashamed of; and yet his book
from head to foot stands most upon a negative Argument from some particular
place of Scripture; for he speaks nothing of the power of Elders, to keep the
holy things of God pure.

What if he should say, Moses in the first of Genesis says not, I will not
have you not to come to the Lords Supper; Ergo, there is no authoritative
debarring of men from the Lords Supper: Such sandy consequences no learned
Divines would ever dream of: 2. Beza, nor any of our Divines never dreamed that
God in the Old or New Testament said, Nolo vos ad mensam domini (ad sacramenta)
venire, which are the words of Erastus; so his conclusion comes All are
invited to the Sacraments, but not that they come any way they please.
not near the controversy* Jews and Gentiles are invited, and commanded to
come to Christ, and so to all the Ordinances and Sacraments, but I hope this
will not infer that all should come to the Sacraments hand over head, and
whether they be clean or unclean, circumcised or Baptized, or not circumcised,
not Baptized. God commanded Aarons sons to serve in the sanctuary, and appear
before him in their charge: What, Ergo, it is not Gods will, that they come not
to the Sanctuary, and before him unwashed; and with strange fire, and without
their holy garments* this is the very consequence of Erastus: Our question I
conceive is, whither all The question whether all should be admitted to the
Lords Supper perverted by Erastus. Cap. 3. l. 1. p. 117. Lib. 3. c. 3. page
207. Et si quis talis (qui caleabit sacramenta) reperiatur hunc ego numine
admittendum censeo.
must be admitted promiscuously, and whether even those that come immediately
from the Devils Table, without any preparation known to the Church, should be
set at Christ's elbow to eat the Lords body and blood? Erastus says, Paul never
said, Nolo vos ad mensam domini venire; then because two negatives make one
affirmative, Paul must say, I will that all that are partakers of the table of
the Devil, come and be partakers of the Lords body: But the conclusion is
contradicent to Erastus himself, who faith right down: I judge, that he, who
will but trample the Sacraments, should not be admitted unto them, and to
Paul, 1 Cor. 11. 27, etc. 3. Erastus confounds two Questions; one is, whither
all should be admitted to the Lords Supper: ( Erastus says, every where in his
book none are to be debarred;) and another by whom are they to be admitted or
debarred? By the civil Magistrates, says Erastus; by the Stew^rds and
Officers of the house of God, the rest of the Church consenting, say we. 4. The
Argument will conclude, that not only the Church or Magistrate ought to admit
those that have fellowship with the Devil to the Table of Christ, but they
ought to command them to come, it being Christ's will they should be admitted,
and that they themselves who are Communicants are obliged, though keeping
fellowship with the Devil, to come, and eat their own damnation: for Paul
says, by this reason in the place, 1 Cor. 10. No more (I will not have the
partakers of the Devils table, to come to the Lords table) nor he says, (I
will not have the Elders to debar them) if Erastus say, they should try and
examine themselves and come: He flees from the controversy, which is not,
whether the worthy, but whether the scandalous and unworthy should come;
Erastus says, all should come. 5. Whereas Erastus will have the Apostle to
speak of the external Communion of the Elements only: 1. It is false. 2.
Nothing to the purpose, it is false, 1. ver. 16. It is called the Communion of
the body and blood of Christ, and that must be more then external Communion.
2. ver. 17. We many are one body; this is not an external body only, for it is
the unity of the body of Christ signified by one bread. 3. It is not external
only, but internal and spiritual fellowship with Devils that is condemned,
ver. 20. 21. Ergo, It must be internal Communion with Christ in his death that
is sealed and commanded. 4. This is mere Socinianisme, to have the Sacraments
only memorative signs, as is clear. 2. It is not to a purpose, for if the
Church debar only from external society, from the Church and external Seals;
this debarring being ratified in Heaven, Matthew. 18. It is sufficient for our
conclusion. 5. Paul his condemning of eating at the Idols Table, as
inconsistent with eating and drinking of the Lords body, he must expressly
forbid those who eats in the Idoll-Temple, to come to the Lords Table, except
they repent, and try themselves: Hence it must follow, that if Christ have
commanded his Stewards, to dispense the word of promise and threatenings, and
comforts, according to the temper of the flock, so must they dispense the
Seals, and so by good consequence Paul said ( I will not have the Lord and
Satan mingled, nor a partaker of Satan's Table admitted to the Lords Table)
(...);

Erastus his Arg. 13. 1 Cor. 10. God spared not idolaters and murmurers; Page
118.
yet they eat, we, and they of the same spiritual meat, and drink the same
spiritual drink, and so had the same Sacraments (otherwise the Argument of
the Apostle were nothing; if ours and their Sacraments were not all one) if
then, those that were idolators, fornicators, were admitted to their
Sacraments; then also to ou^^ under the New Testament.

Ans. Beza answers well to that. Manna and the water ouf of the Rock, as they
had a spiritual Relation to Christ, were holy things and types of Christ, just
as our Sacraments are signs of Christ already come in the flesh, and so agreed
in the kind of holy signs with our Sacraments: yet Manna, and the water out
of the Rock, were also ordained to be bodily food, for the famishing and
thirsty people, good or bad, holy or unholy, these two, Manna and water out of
the Rock were given by the Commandment of God and the Priests, to the people,
both as Gods people in Covenant with God, and to them, as men starving in the
wilderness, and dying for thirst; for they had not plowing, earing, harvest,
bread, vineyards, wine, fountains in the wilderness, and therefore no marvel
then such holy things being; also beside that they were holy things, such as
were necessary to keep them from starving and bodily death, as the shewbread,
which was also a type of the word of life* revealed to the Ministers of God,
was given to keep David and his men from starving: No marvel (I say) then
these bodily helps (though in another higher signification they were
Sacramentalls) were by Gods command bestowed on many wicked men, who often
partake both of outward Ordinances and temporal deliverance from death and
famishing, because they are mixed with the people of God. But Erastus, if he
would prove any thing against us, should have proved that circumcision, the
Passover, and other holy things of God, ordained for the visible Saints to
show forth our spiritual Communion with Christ, and which were never ordained
for necessiry helps to sustain the natural life, were to be administered to
those that were openly profane and wicked; and therefore we deny this
connection: Manna signified the very same thing; to wit, Christ our food of
life, which bread and wine signifies; Ergo, As Manna was given both as a holy
sign to figure out Christ our life, and to feed the bodies of openly holy, or
openly profane, to sustain their bodily life, so also baptism and the Lords
Supper, which serve for no bodily use, should be administered to those that are
openly profane.

Erastus is put to a poor shift with this solid Answer of that Reverend, Two
sorts of signs, some purely holy some partly holy, partly necessary for the
bodily life.
Learned, and holy Divine, Theod. Bez^, he says, Vis dicam quod sentio? Tui
ubique similises: The sea and the cloud, says he, were not necessary to feed
the body.

It is true, Erastus the Physician would think the cloud and pillar of fire can
neither be Physic for the sick, nor food for the whole, yet Physicians say,
Manna is apt for both; not is the dvided Red Sea, food or Physic: But good
man, he knows the cloud was their guide and convey by night and day through
the wilderness, and appointed by God to convey the Leapers, the unclean, and
all those who were Excommunicated from the holy things, and the Idolators and
openly wicked, as well as the clean and the holy, and he knew the some that the
people had no food but Manna a holy sign, that those who were unclean seven
days, and often many times longer, were not to starve for hunger, but must eat
Manna though a holy, yet their only necessary food then, without which they
could not live.

But I hope Erastus cannot prove, while they were unclean, or put out of the
Camp, or yet extremely wicked, that they might eat the Passover which was a
mere holy Sacrament, not ordained for the feeding of the body, as Manna and
water out of the Rock were.

Erastus may know the dividing of the Sea, was necessary to preserve the life
of the most wicked and unclean (God being pleased for his Churches cause, to
bestow Temporal deliverances on wicked men, mingled with the godly) from being
drowned with the Egyptians, and that God, who will have mercy, and not
sacrifice, may well by a positive Law appoint that holy and unholy, clean and
unclean, shall have the use of such holy things, as are not merely holy, but
mixed, being both means of Divine institution, and also necessary Subsidies for
man's life, but it follows not therefore holy things, that are purely holy,
should be prostitute to holy and unholy, the clean and unclean.

Erastus. God in the Church of the Jews punished wicked men with Page 120.
bodily punishments, not with Exclusion from the Sacraments, and Paul
threatens death and sickness, not Excommunication to those that did eat and
drink unworthily.

Ans. Then putting out of the Camp was no Exclusion from the holy things of
God, all the world not only will cry shame on this Divinity: But they will
say, Erastus, his Logic is bad. God punishes some wicked men with death, and
the sword of the Magistrate, and stoning; Ergo, he appointed no Ecclesiastical
debarring of the unclean from Circumcision: 2. It is false that Paul threatens
death to unworthy Communicants; only he says, God ^lew many of them for that
sin; and hence it follows well, the Officers should* hinder the scandalous to
rush into such a sin, as is the not discerning the Lords body, which brings
death and diseases on the actors: What consequence is this? God punishes
wicked men; Ergo, the Officers should not rebuke them for those sins, nor the
Magistrate or Church punish wicked men: God punishes ^^ubborn Rebels to
parents; Ergo, the judge should not stone them, the contrary Logic is the
arguing of the Spirit of God.

Erastus. Every one is to try himself, therefore there is no need of P. 120,
121.
any other to try him, for Paul speaks of that which is proper to every man's
conscience.

Ans. It is an unlearned and vain consequence: It is commanded, that every one
try if he be in the Faith or no; for the peace of his conscience, and this is
so proper to a man himself, and so personal* that no man can try, or know
certainly, whether be in the state of grace, but he himself, 2 Cor. 13. 5. Rev.
2. 17. None can join with him in this, as none can join with a man to try if he
have faith to discern the Lords body, and eat worthily, but will it follow
therefore the Pastor should not watch over him to try in another way in a
Pastoral way, by his walking, profession, and practical knowledge, whether he
be in Christ or no.

The contrary is Heb. 13. 17. They watch for the souls of the people, as they
that must give an account. And they are so far to try that are Shepherds, that
they are obliged in a Pastoral way, to know those of the flock that are
diseased, Ezech. 34. 4. Sick, broken, driven away, and lost. And to what end
should they try themselves, least they eat damnation to themselves? Ergo, the
Stewards should try the stomachs, that they eat not poison: If then, the Lords
Law bid men beware they be not tempted to Sorcery, Sodomy, Murders; and if
every man ought to have personal watchfulness over his own conscience, that
he be not ensnared to those sins; and Achan was to try if his heart was engaged
to the wedge of Gold, and to be wary to meddle with it, but it does not follow
that Magistrates, as Joshua should not try out Sorcerers, Sodomites, and other
Achans to punish them.

Erastus, 2 Cor. 13. is against this; a person is to try himself: Will it
follow when he has tried himself, that he cannot come to the Lords Supper,
except he seem meet to the Elders. And this not our consequence, let Erastus
own it, we care not* In a constitute Church he should, else Erastus provides
no way against a Pagan, who has heard the Word, as he may do, 1 Cor. 14. 23.
may without the Elders and Church sit down at the Lords Supper, for Erastus
provides no stop for him, but only his own pagan Conscience, and so may one by
that rule but trample on the Sacrament, his own Conscience is all his rule,
contrary to what he says himself, lib. 3. c. ^. p. 207.

Erastus 1 Cor. 11. Paul forbids none to come to the Supper, but upon
supposition that they come as the manner is, he bids them come worthily, as
all are bidden hear the Word, though they ^e forbidden to he are it, as if it
were some profane History; nor does the Lord command sinful coming, for no
act commanded of God is evil.

Ans. 1. Paul then forbids not Pagans, more to come to the All are commanded
to hear the Word, but not to come to the Supper.
Supper, and Children, then he forbids them to hear the Word, which is
absurd; he commands all to hear, but he commands not all to come to the
Supper, but those only that can discern the Lords body, for to hear the
Word, though I be not prepared, is simply necessary, if I would be saved; and
to sacrifice, if I would be reconciled; and to pray, if I would obtain any
blessing: though the manner of doing all these be commanded, that I hear,
sacrifice, and pray in faith. But to come to the Supper is not commanded to
all, not to Pagans, not to children, not to the unregenerated; but only to the
regenerated, and to those who discern the Lords body: and for a child to come
to the Lords Supper, or an unrenewed man, is forbidden, not commanded, and no
ill act is commanded, and it is a sin that they come at all: But Erastus will
have it lawful as it is to hear the Word, then does Christ command Turks and
children to come to the Supper, for he commands them to hear the Word, and
Peter bade Simon Magus pray, Act. 8. 22. but he neither bids give the Supper to
him, nor bids he him receive it, but by the contrary, forbids pearls to be
cast unto Swine.

Erastus Arg. 16. God will not have fewer Christians to be members Arg. 16.
Page 124.
of the Church now, then of Jews to be members of the Jewish Church. But God
would have all circumcised, even the most flagitious, that were punished by the
Magistrate, to be members of the Jews Church, Ergo, God will have all the
baptized to be Members of the Church.

Ans. This will prove, that all baptized, even children, should come to the
Supper. 2. I deny the Minor, to wit, that all the most wicked remained Members
of the visible Jewish Church, jure before God, the wicked Jews to God, were as
Sodom and Gomorrah, Esa. 1. 10. Yea he says, Amos 9. 7. Are ye not unto me as
children of Ethiopians, O children of Israel, says the Lord? What they were de
facto, and not cast out, was the fault of the Priests, and that the Church does
tolerate Iezabels, Wolves, Lions in the flock, and admits them to holy
things, is their sin.

Erastus. But Repentance was not always commanded to those Page 124.
Jews especially who were unclean, by touching an unclean thing against their
will and ignorantly, and the purging of them depended on their own will, so
they observed the Ceremonies of Moses.

Ans. That is much for us, if those who were unclean, against their will, and
cast out of the camp, it being a trying Type, that far more those that are
wickedly scandalous are to be cast out of the Church.

Erastus. The Church is a draw-^et, a field, a marriage Supper, there be good
and ill in it, and it was not the sin of the inviters, who are bidden invite
all good and bad, Mat. 22. But the man that came himself, without the wedding
garment, he is cast into utter darkness: Ergo, The Officers are to invite
all, and forbid none.

Ans. They are to invite all, to all Ordinances, and Seals, even Dogs and
Swine, that is false: They are to invite all to some Ordinances; to hear the
Law and Gospel preached, but not the Seals, that were to cast Pearls to
Swine. 2. The way of Erastus is, that none are to be debarred, nor to debar
themselves from the Seals, more then from the Word.

The Lords forbidding Adam to touch the tree of Life, and his casting of him
out of Paradise, and Cains being cast out from the presence of the Lord, to me
are rather Types presignifying Excommunication, and that God will have wicked
men debarred from holy things, then patterns of Excommunications, and so are
they alleged by Beza and our Divines.

CHAP. VII.
Quest. 3.
Whether Erastus does justly deny that Excommunication was typified in the Old
Testament?

We take types of uncleanness in the Old Testament, to be rightly expounded,
when the holy Ghost in the New Testament does expound them. Now that
Ceremonial uncleannes did typifie Moral uncleanness is clear, 2 Cor. 7. 17.
Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you, 18. And I will be a Father
unto you, and ye shall be my Sons and Daughters, says the Lord Almighty.
This is a manifest Exposition of the Ceremonial holiness and cleanness,
commanded in the book of Leviticus, for after the Lord has given them a
number of Laws, about eschewing of unclean things, he says in general, Lev.
26. 3. If ye walk in my Statutes, and keep my Commandments, and do them.
11. I will set my Tabernacle amongst you, and I will be your God, and ye shall
be my people. And it is a clear allusion to Numb. 19. 11. He that touches the
dead body of any man, shall be unclean seven days. 16. He that touches one
that is slain with the sword, in the open field, is unclean. 22. Whatsoever
the unclean person touches shall be unclean: So Paul, Tit. 1. 15. To them
that are defiled and unbeleeving, nothing is pure, but even their mind and
conscience is defiled.

2. The Prophets expound it so, Ezekiel. 36. 25. Then will I sprinkle clean water
upon you, and ye shall be clean. From all your filthiness, and all your Idols
will I cleanse you. Has he not a clear reference to the water of Separation,
Number. 19.? With this water the unclean person, and his clothes were washed, yea,
the Tents and the Vessels, ver. 17, 21. According to which, says Paul, 2 Cor.
7. 1. Having therefore these promises (dearly beloved,) let us cleanse our
selves, from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit: Here a clear Allusion to
Ceremonial filthiness bodily, and of the flesh* and of Tents and Vessels, Heb.
10. 22. To both these washings there is a reference. Let us draw near, having
our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure
water. And Heb. 9. 13. If the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of an
heifer (mingled with running water, Number. 19. 17. which purged vessels that were
but capable of Ceremonial uncleanness) sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to
the purifying of the flesh. 14. How much more shall the blood of Christ, --
purge your conscience from dead works? It is clear also, that the unclean were
separated and the Leper put out of the camp, so as the children of Israel
might not touch any thing Ceremonially unclean, and all unclean persons were
put out of the Congregation. Hence the Hypocrites word alluding to that
separation, Esa. 64. 5. Stand by thy self, come not near to me; for I am
holier then thou. So was Miriam removed, and leprous King Vzziah out of the
Congregation of the Lord.

Erastus. We deny that the Ceremonial uncleannes, signified the Confirm. These.
l. 2. c. 1. p. 130. 131.
wickedness of conversation, so that it can be proved that both these
uncleanness were punished with the same punishment. 1. Because many against
their will were polluted legally, as the night pollutions, the diseases
monthly of women, when they were necessitated to be with Children, Parents,
Wife, brethren when they died; sometimes they touched unclean things
ignorantly, but no man lives wickedly against his will. 2. God could not forbid
in every time and place the touching of the dead, only God commanded the
polluted to be purified according to the Law: God would have his people near
their dying friends, but God never gave leave to any to live wickedly. 3. A
holy man not sinning in his thought, remaining holy, might be legally unclean,
without either his will or knowledge, by touching some unclean thing, that
he knevv not to be unclean. But a wicked man does not at one time both do
wickedly, and remain pure and holy.

Ans. All this is a mere cavilling at the wisdom of God, in making such
Ceremonial laws, and such punishments against the transgressors of them, as
the wise Lawgiver of his free will thought fit, because these Laws seem
ridiculous. But the foolishnes of God is wiser then men. 1. We say not, that
the punishment of legal and moral uncleanness is all one every way, and
always; it is enough for our purpose that God will have those who are legally
unclean separated from holy things, while they be purified, and little sin
and guiltiness seem to be in legal uncleanness, as when bodily Leprosy
came on persons against their will, yet when God will have them punished with
being removed from the people of God, from the Sanctuary and the holy things,
this could not be for it self; for as Paul says, Does God take care of Oxen?
So we, does God hate bodily diseases, which are his own just actions, not our
sinful doings? since I say God hates them not, and puts not punishment on
them for themselves; therefore it must be to signify what detestation and
punishment the Lord our God, would have his Church to put upon moral
wickedness: So we think Erastus might have spared paper and pains, in
proving a difference (which no Divine denies,) between Ceremonial and Moral
uncleanness, and the punishment of the one and of the other, for it can never
prove his conclusion. Ergo, Separation for legal uncleanness, cannot typifie
separation for Moral uncleanness. I could give eight and twenty differences
between Isaac and Christ, as Erastus gives seventeen or eighteen between
Legal and Moral uncleanness, and the punishment of both: But I hope that
should never conclude against the Holy Ghost, Heb. 11. 17, 18, 19. Gal. 4. 28,
29, 30. Romans 9. 9. that Isaac was not a type of Jesus Christ. 2. Night
pollutions are not altogether against our will, they are sinful pollutions,
except concupiscence, and lustful habitual day lusts, the cause of them, be
not sinful pollutions; yea, and forbidden in the seventh Commandment.

3. These pollutions Legal caused by invincible ignorance, were types or
symbolicall signs of our original iniquity, and give me leave to doubt, if
all actual touching of things unclean, was no Moral sinfulness. I conceive
the Jews, as the Christians also were obliged to walk (...), Ephesians. 5. 15. and
were to take heed to the outer-man, that they should come near no unclean
thing, in some cases leprosy and other legal uncleannes came on them without
either will or knowledge. 4. If the standing beside the dying friends be all
one with touching the dead, I remit to the principles of Physic, and if the
touching of any dead be excepted in the Law Ceremonial, let the learned judge.
All the other differences assigned by Erastus I leave, as not concludent
against us, they tend all either to blame God, who should punish some legal
uncleannes, that is, altogether against the will of man, with any punishment at
all, as the three first differences insinuate. Or, 2. that God punished some
Legal uncleannes more severely then homicide and Moral uncleannes, as the 5.
difference does insinuate, and the 4. difference. And this is to challenge God,
to whom I desire to ascribe a Sovereignty, both in punishing, or pardoning as
he thinks good: Or in punishing more severely, or more mildely these same
sins, or in punishing greater sins with lighter punishment, and with a
heavier rod lighter sins.

Erastus. Any legally unclean was debarred from the Temple, 133.
the difference was only in the time, but you debar not all wicked men from
the Supper.

Ans. The most that were legally unclean, were also morally unclean, in that
they willingly transgressed a known Law; Ergo, Legal uncleannes, was also
Moral uncleannes. 2. Though we debar not all wicked men, but only the
scandalous, yet we have in readiness vengeance against all, and so against
latent disobedience, which is a high censure, in debarring hypocrites from
heaven; and we conceive Legal uncleannes as the monthly diseases of women,
night pollutions, want of Circumcision did typifie much natural and original
heart corruption, which cannot be punished by men or the Church; but it
follows not, because Legal uncleanness signifies some other uncleanness
then that which is scandalous and censurable by the Church; Ergo, it signifies
not sins scandalous and censurable by the Church.

Erastus. He that was legally unclean a long time, or all his life, 134.
as a Leper; was not esteemed as no Jew, or uncircumcised, or a damned man, he
was to keep the Sabbath; yea, none unclean were excluded from the Sacrament of
the general expiation in the 10. Month, Lev. 16. and 23. Yea, every soul
under the pain of cutting off, was to afflict his soul that day: then the
Lepers were not as Heathen and Publicans and condemned men, yea the Magistrate
could not punish a man for Leprosy.

Ans. This is a poor argument, because Ceremonial Excommunication differs
from Christian Excommunication; Ergo, the former is not a type of the latter,
it follows not. Isaacs blood was never really shed, Christ was really
crucified, Isaac was not mocked, spitted on, did not wear a crown of Thorns,
Jews and Gentiles crucified him not, between two Thieves. Ergo, Isaac was no
figure of Christ offered for our sins, it follows not. 2. Nor are Lepers no
Jews, but in some respect, they might no more come to the Temple. 2. Nor
amongst the people of God, nor 3. Eat the Passover, then Heathens might do;
and so are the Excommunicated with u^, they are not exempted from faith,
repenting, afflicting their soul for the sins of the Land, nor are they
eternally damned, so they repent. But Erastus has no ground to say, because
the unclean were to afflict their souls, and abstain from servile work in
the day of atonement, (as our Excommunicants are not loosed from the duties of
the ten Commandments wholly, but from some public Church duties) but I see
not how it follows; Ergo, The unclean were to come to the holy convocation in
the day of expiation, and to observe the public solemnities with Gods people;
One Law of God is not contradicent to another, and the Leper and unclean were
separated, Ergo, God could not tie them to be mingled with his people. 3. The
Leper was not punished by the Magistrate, for he suffered only for his
Leprosy. But it follows not that the Magistrate should not punish a person
obstinate to the Church.

Erastus. When some unclean persons were debarred from the Tabernacle 136.
and sacrifices, many wickedmen were admitted: Ergo. Moses both commanded men,
at the same time, to come to the holy things, and not to come.

Answ. Moses bade the unclean come, he bade all clean, so they were not
scandalously and openly wicked, come; and some came that were not bidden, but
rebuked for their coming, as Ier. 7. 8. 9. Psalm. 50. 15. Here is no
contradiction.

Erastus. There be no figures of things present, but of things to come; moral
uncleanness was present, at least there be no figures of things that incur
in the senses, as theft and homicide.

Ans. Circumcision, the Lords Supper, are signs and Symbols of things present,
as of Original sin, our present union with Christ, and communion of love
amongst our selves, Col. 2. 11. 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17, 18. 2. Scandals, as they are
spiritual wickedness, incur not in our senses, yet other ways they are
visible. 3. Christ's dying was both tyipfied to John the Apostle, and Mary, and
his death incurred in their senses, they saw him die. So was Christ raised from
the dead, typified by Jonas in the belly of the Whale, and with their eyes they
saw him, after he rose again.

Erastus. Houses, clothes, trees, stones, were capable of legal uncleannes,
137.
men only of Moral; Legal uncleannes is a quality, wickedness moral is in
actions.

Ans. I am ashamed and wearied to put in Paper such childish things, all this
will not prove that Legal uncleannes is no type of Moral uncleannes; Isaac
was but a man, Moses a man only; Ergo, they cannot be Types of Christ who is
more then a man; Bread and Wine are some other thing then Christ, then cannot
these be symbols of Christ, and our spiritual communion with him. I see
nothing here, but a challenging of Gods wisdom, who has chosen leprosy
bodily, to figure out sins spiritual Leprosy. Erastus will say not so,
Leprosy is in the category of quality, and sinful actions in the category of
actions.

Erastus. Legal uncleannes, signifies natural corruption, not scandals.

Ans. Yea but Leprosy and other uncleannes legal, was contagious and
infectious, and did relate to wicked actions that infect as a canker; sin
original being common to all* is not that contagious from one to many; nor did
the Lord ever command Separation for sin Original, but for transgression of
Ceremonial Laws he did.

Erastus. The Ceremonial uncleannes does typifie the justification, and
washing of a sinner in Christ's blood, because no unclean thing can enter in the
New Jerusalem, and so the Scripture, Rev. 21. Esa. 4^. Joel 3. Acts 15. And it
shadows out no such thing as Excommunication out of the Church.

Ans. All the arguments that Erastusmade to prove that legal Ceremonial
uncleannes typified Exclusion out of the visible Church for Scandals, not out
of the Kingdom of Heaven.
separation and uncleannes, proves not Excommunication and Moral uncleannes,
will with the same force conclude, that Legal uncleannes is not that which
excludes men out of heaven, As for instance; to begin with the last, Legal
uncleanness signifies sin original, not wicked actions, therefore it
signifies not scandals, then by this Legal uncleannes that caused legal
separation, is signified men's exclusion out of the high Jerusalem, for only
sin Original, not for actual sins. This type must be a lying type, for
actual sins especially deba^res us out of the New Jerusalem, Rev. 21. 8. c.
22. 15. 1 Cor. 6. 9. 2. Legal uncleannes and corruption of nature, differ as
much as legal uncleannes and actual wickedness. But Erastus said the former
cannot typifie the latter. 1. Because Legal uncleannes is often involuntary,
2. It is not universally forbidden. 3. Many godly men may be legally unclean,
but actual moral wickedness is not so, even so say I. 1. All natural or
original uncleannes is voluntary in Adam. 2. Is universally forbidden. 3. It
cannot consist with that holiness which we must have, or we cannot see God. 3.
By Erastus his fourth difference, legal uncleannes was otherwise punished then
natural corruption, for natural corruption is punished with the first and
second death, Ephesians. 2. 2. Romans 5. 15, 16. the like may be said of all the
rest. 4. Numb. 12. 14. Shame was unseparably annexed to Leprosy with
contagion, so leavening of others, and shame is annexed to ^oul scandals, and
annexed to casting out of the Church, 1 Cor. 5, 6, 7. 2 These. 3. 14. Gal. 5. 9,
10. But though a necessity of washing may be holden forth to us in Legal
uncleannes, ere we enter into Heaven; yet not so directly as in legal
separation, for in it men scandalous are excluded out of the church, least the
unclean should infect the clean, as is clear as the light, Number. 19. 22. Hag.
2. 13. Gal. 5. 9. 10. 1 Cor. 5. 6, 7. but wicked men are not excluded out of
the New Jerusalem in heaven, for fear they should infect and defile any person
in heaven. 2. Separation from the Church is medicinal, Number. 12. 14. that the
party may be humbled and pardoned, 2 Cor. 5, 6, 7. that the Spirit may be saved
in the day of the Lord, 1 Cor. 5. 5. and the man shamed for his further good, 2
These. 3. 14. But exclusion of men out of the New Jerusalem for their
uncleannes, Rev. 21. is not medicinal, that they may be humbled, but for their
everlasting shame and destruction; and therefore a separation from the Church by
way of discipline is here intended, not any exclusion out of heaven.

Erastus. All Legal uncleannes is punished with exclusion, but no Page 140.
man for corruption of nature is excluded out of the Church.

Ans. We grant all, and therefore legal uncleannes did hold forth actual
scandalousnesse, not natural corruption.

Erastus. The actions of unclean men were punished by death, Ergo, Not by
exclusion out of the Church.

Ans. The Antecedent is not universally true: Capital faults, as I said
before, were only thus punished; the consequence is null.

Erastus. He that was legally unclean did defile all beside him, Page 142, 143,
144, 145.
even vessels, places, garments; but Thieves, adulterers do not defile, but
these that consent to their wickedness; nor did they defile the places; The
adulterous women brought to the Priest and temple, did not defile the Priest or
Temple, Ioh. 8. Nor did Moses and others abstain from the worship, the Manna,
etc. because many wicked men did partake thereof, nor were the vessels purified
after wicked men touched them; therefore it follows not, because God is more
offended with the sacrifices of the wicked, then of those that are only
legally unclean, that therefore wicked men are no less to be debarred from
the holy things, then those that are legally unclean.

Ans. This is to dispute with God; God made a law, that he who being legally
unclean, should touch men or things legally unclean, should pollute; This Law,
God freely made as a positive statute; who can tie God to make the like Law
touching those that are morally unclean? no man: now because God made no such
Law, it leaves not off to be the sin of the Priests, that they brought the
uncircumcised in heart to the Sanctuary, as God complains, Ezekiel. 44. 8, 9. c.
22, 26. And that the Church should hinder the wicked to pollute the holy things
of God. 2. The adulterous woman was brought to the Priest and Temple to be
judged, God had so commanded, and therefore no wonder she polluted neither
Priest nor Temple, but had she not polluted the Passover Morally, though I
say not Ceremonially, if she had eaten without Repentance and offering for her
sin? I think she would.

Erastus. Though God punish not pollution of holy things, by debarring men from
them, it follows not that he winketh at them, for he punishes them with
death, and more grievously.

Ans. But by this that God punishes the pollution of non-converting Page 146.
Ordinances with death, we gather that the Church should also hinder the
pollutions of them, and punish Swine that trample on Pearls, and not
prostitute holy things to their lust. Beza said, those that were unclean, had
need of Sacrifices, Ergo, They were guilty of sin. Erastus says, that
external uncleannes was not sin, but because it put us in mind of our
natural corruption, that had need to be purged in Christ's blood. Ans. The
breach of a Law is sin, a Ceremonial Law is a Law. 2. It was punished often
with cutting off from the Congregation, but God did not cut off men from Page
140. At nemo propter ingenitam naturae corruptionem p^nitur. Page 147. Legal
uncleanness was sin.
the Congregation for natural corruption, as Erastus grants.

Erastus. If legal uncleannes were sin, God would not have commanded it: But
God commanded, or at least permitted the Priests and others to pollute
themselves with the dead, Levit. 21. Ezekiel. 44.

Ans. It is weakly argued, for the father to kill the son, then should be no
sin; God commanded Abraham to offer up his son Isaac; it is not properly a
defiling, nor a sin, when God Levit. 21. wills the Priest to be near those
of his kin when they die, it is Gods own exception from the Law, though to
come near to others when they are dead be sin. Gods commanding and forbidding
will is the formal cause and rule of obedience and sin.

Erastus. Where find you that the Priests were to judge whether Page 150.
any had repented, that so he might be admitted to the Temple?

Ans. It is written, Ezekiel. 44. 99. c. 22. 26. the Priests should not have
admitted the uncircumcised in heart to the Sanctuary; Ergo, they should have
tried if they were such ere they admitted them. Yea, if in the very day of his
oblation ere he offer, the sinner must first restore what he has unjustly
taken away, Lev. 6. 4, 5, 6. Ergo, The Priest except he rule unjustly, should
judge whether he have first restored it in the principal, and added the fifth
part more into it, Levit. 6. 5. As Ezra the Priest stood up, and said unto
them, ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, -- now therefore
make confession, and separate your self from the people of the Land, and from
the strange wives, Ezra, c. 10. v. 11, 12. And this they did ere they
sacrificed; Ergo, the Priests judged of their repentance, before they were
admitted to Sacrifice: and the washing of the hands in Innocence before the
person compassed the Altar, Psalm. 26. 6. must be tried by the Priest, if not,
the Priest offered to God the Sacrifice of fools, and did eat the sins of
the people, in offering for contumacious impenitents.

Erastus says, the putting away of their wives was a civil business, and
belonged to the Magistrate.

Ans. Ezra was a Priest, and Shechaniah says, ver. 5. Arise, this matter
belongs to thee, and he is ordinarily called Ezra the Priest.

CHAP. 8.
Quest. 4.
How Erastus acquitteth himself, in proving that the place Mat. 18. makes
nothing for Excommunication.

ERastus. The scope of the Lord is to teach how great an evil scandal Lib. ^.
c. 2. p. 154. 155. The scope and sense of Mat. 18. perverted by Erastus.
is, and how without offense scandals of vveake may be removed, because when
we refer an injury to the judge, the vveak may be scandalized: he speaks
not here of great injuries to be removed by Excommunication, but of lesser, and
private ones betvveen brother and brother, before we bring them before heathen
judicatures proper to Heathens and Publicans.

Ans. There is no scope of our Savior to prevent heathen judicatures dreamed
of in the Text, nor a shadow thereof, Vel per decimam tertiam consequentiam. 2.
He speaks not of small injuries only. 1. Christ must not be straightened in his
words; he speaks of scandals in general, ver. 7. Woe to the world, because of
offenses, they be not light that brings a woe upon the world. 2. He says
indefinite, If thy brother shall trespass against thee, this is comprehensive
of all offenses. 3. He speaks of such offenses, from which I am to gain my
brother. Verse 15. But I am to gain him from Our Savior speaks of all, not of
private and lesser scandals only.
all, great or small. 4. He speaks of such as I must bring before the Church,
in case of my brothers obstinacy; but that is comprehensive of all, verse 17.
5. He speaks of such as are bound in heaven, these be great and small, verse
19. 6. He speaks of such as I must forgive, v. 15. but I must forgive all to
seventy seven times as Luke 17. 7. He speaks of such as being persisted in,
makes a brother no brother, but as a Heathen and a Publican, but great and
public Scandals rather do this, then small and private ones.

Erastus. The sense is when thy brother, that is, any Jew, does thee Page 26.
in These. 41.
an injury, study to reconcile him to thee thy self alone; if thou speed not
so, assay the same before two or three Witnesses: but if neither so thou can
free thy self of injury, tell the Synedrie, that is, tell the Magistrate of
thy people, or thy own Religion; but if he will not hear the Magistrate, then
thou may without the offense of any, deal against him, as a Publican, and
aninjurious Heathen, who will acknowledge only the Roman judicature, and
pursue him there.

Ans. If this be the sense, it is farther from the understanding many miles
then the words; a common reader may come after, and find a more native sense.
1. If thy brother offend thee, etc. should By the word brother is not meant a
Jew only.
not be restricted to the Jews only, nor the Gentiles only, the Disciples,
for the most were Gentiles and nearer Christians then Jews. 2. Brother is as
large as the offender, as those of the Church. 3. As large as the offender, to
be gained, Paul was to do what he could to gain Jews and Gentiles, and both
may offend. 2. Christ's scope is not so much to free the Plaintiff from
injuries, (it is a carnal like gloss) as to remove Scandals and Stumbling
blocks out of the way of both; and gain the offenders soul. Observe that the
Exposition of Erastus is so wild, that sense, scriptures, or Greek Authors
cannot dream that (let him be as a Heathen) can be in sense all one with this,
Pursue him for his injury before the Roman judicatures. But the Exposition we
give according to the word in its first notion, does offer it self to the
understanding: For, Let him be to thee, as an Heathen, is, let him be counted
as one that is without the Church, and not of the people of God, as the word
Heathen is t^^en, Levit. 25. 44. 2 King. 17. 8. Psalm. 2. 1. Psalm. 44. 2. Psalm.
46. 6. Jer. 9. 16. Lam. 1. 3. Ezekiel. 20. 23. Lam. 1. 10. Act. 4. 27. Cor. 5. 1.
Ephesians. 2. 11. 1 These. 4. 5. 1 Pet. 2. 12. Rev. 11. 12.

3. It will be long, ere Scripture make a parallel to this; Tell the Church,
that is, Tell the King, tell the civil judge, that is, tell not the Church;
For the Church deals with spiritual Armor (and the King is not the Church)
2. with no force or violence, but the word and discipline; 3. with the man's
conscience, to gain the man to repentance, for so all Christ's three steps is to
save the soul and to gain him to repentance.

Erastus lays a good Iron club over the offenders shoulders, and Erast. conf.
These. l. 2. ^. 1. p. 133. Sive facinorosos facinoris paeniteret, sive non
paeniteret, paena non minuebatur.
brings the offender to a Civilian, to whom Christ never committed the Gospel:
What? shall the justice of peace, preach Christ to the offender, and wield the
rod of Christ's power out of Zion to him? Is there no way but that to gain a
soul? 2. He brings him to one who has no weapon, to a Magistrate, but a weapon
of steel, the sharp sword; or 3. will this Magistrate not labor to gain him,
which clearly is Christ's intent (O he is greedy in his stairs to have the lost
gained, as is ver. 11. 12.) then Christ misseth his end. But whether the man
repent or no (says Erastus) the Magistrate as such, must cudgel the offender.
4. It is admirable that ( Let him be to thee as a publican and a Heathen) must
be a new Judicature, and this is to drive him to Cesars Tribunal; a strange
gloss: but 1. This will loose him out of hand; will Nero and the Heathen L. 2.
cap. 2. page 155.
judge, Preach him back a submissive Lamb to the Jews? But. 2. How do you this
Citra offensionem, without scandalizing? Paul cannot advise what Erastus does;
he thinks Christians should rather suffer injuries, then to implead a brother
before a Heathen judge, 1 Cor. 6. Yea, but ere you suffer so (says Erastus)
cause him to compear, and answer the highest Heathen judge on earth, to teach
him better manners: This is a vindictive-like way: 2. Scandalous heathens will
say, See how these Disciples of Jesus agree: 3. Its the highest rupture of
love, 1 Cor. 6.

Erastus. By my exposition, I do not, as Beza says, take away a brotherly
pardoning of all injuries, for though Christ teach us how to compose and remove
only private injuries piously, and without the scandalizing of the vveak, it
follows not therefore Christ teaches that only private injuries are to be
pardoned, does Christ teach no other thing? I never thought that only light
injuries are to (...) pardoned: when either we chide him, or he willingly
acknovvledge his fault, we are to pardon him, for if we must bring a small
injury to the Church, far more must we bring a greater injury.

Ans. 1. Christ would so many injuries to be pardoned, as is comprehended in
this general ( If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him) but this
comprehends great injuries, and all injurie^: It being as Erastus says,
parallel to Lev. 19. 18. Thou shall not suffer sin in thy Brother. What? must
we not suffer a small sin in These. 41. p. 46.
our Brother, because that were to hate him in our heart? But we may suffer
great sins in him, and not rebuke him; yet that should not be hatred of our
Brother. 2. Christ is not only teaching how to remove scandals; but how to
remove them by gaining our Brother, even by telling the Church; If need be,
that they may labor to gain him also, if one brother, and if one with two or
three witnesses cannot gain him to repentance; and so he would have all
injuries pardoned, out of which we are to gain our brother. 3. It is too narrow
a compass, to which Erastus draws Christ in his words, only to remove the
scandal without offending the weak, to labor to remove only petty scandals
and not great; yea, and public to our whole Church: 4. Erastus seems to
imagine, if we draw our brother before the Church, that is, the Civil
Magistrate, we do not then forgive him, it being now a great injury, but he is
deceived, we are to forgive our brother, and to pray for his forgiveness; even
when we make the offense public, and when he repents not, as Christ did
forgive as man, those that Crucified him, though they did not repent, 1 Pet. 2.
21, 22, 23. Luke 24. 35, 36, 5. Erastus cannot deny but great injuries should
be brought before the Magistrate, and a little injury, when an offender
refuses to obey the Christian Magistrate, must be a great injury, which makes
the man, as a heathen and a publican; What is before answered, I shall not need
to trouble the Reader withal to repeat. Page 156.


Erastus. The reason, why Christ speaks here of the transaction of private
injuries, is because he speaks alvvaies in the singular numher, if thy
brother offend thee, rebuke him betvveen him and thee alone, take two other,
(...), tell thou the Church, Let him be to thee, as a Publican; he that is
Excommunicated, is not Excommunicated to one only, but to all the Church.

Ans. This shall make the whole ten Commandments, Exodus 20 and the whole Gospel
and the profession of it, Romans 10. 9. which are all spoken to one in the
singular number, often in the second person to command private virtues, and
forbid private sins only, and not to be Laws obliging the Church in public
duties, and to eschew public sins.

Erastus Answers, Let him be to thee who art injured, and to all that are
injured, as a Publican, not to the whole Church, for there be some laws that
agree privately to the Magistrate, and to none other, some to Parents, not to
children, to Masters, not servants, so neither is this precept to all
Christians as the Decalogue is, and such like, but only to those that are
privately hurt; he says not, rebuke every brother thou meetest with, but the
brother that sins against thee. Christ speaks not in the third person, nor to
the Church, for the Disciples were not the Synedrie, or that Church.

Ans. 1. Its most false, that all the precepts of the Decalogue are Christ's
speaking in the second person, argues not the privacy of the scandal.
all of them spoken to all and every man: Honor thy Father and mother that
begat thee, is one of the Commandments; and it is not spoken to those that are
only Parents themselves, and have their natural parents dead: but does it
follow that that Command does injoyne private obedience, and forbid only
private, not public disobedience to natural Parents: So the sixth Command
says, If thy brother fall in a Lions den to the hazard of his life, pull him
out; if thou cannot rescue him thy self alone, take three with thee and assay
it; if thou cannot so rescue him, tell it to twenty: The man is not to rescue
every brother here, but only the brother that is in danger to be devoured with
the Lion: will any say the Law of the sixth Commandment is given here, to one
private man to help another in a private danger? This ( rebuke thy brother) is
the Law of nature, and it is under this, Levit. 19. 17. Thou shall not hate thy
brother in thy heart: And if I rebuke him not for sin, any sin, and the
most public, and so most offensive and scandalous to many; I hate him; nay, I
am not so much to rebuke him and gain his soul, because the sin is an injury
done to me, as because it is done against the Majesty of God, and destructive
to the offenders soul, and I must labor to gain his soul. 2. Erastus
dreams that that is a private sin, which is done to one man, or one rank of
men; to a Magistrate, not a subject; he is beguiled, an offense and public
stumbling block may be laid before one man, and it is often a public sin. 3.
The speaking of it in the second person is nothing, for, If thou believe thou
art saved, Romans 10. 9. is as public and universal, as John 3. 16. Whosoever
believes he is saved. The second person in all precepts of Law and Gospel (and
this, rebuke an offending brother, is both,) is as broad as the third person,
and as large in extent, except you say the verse John 3. 16. comprehends some
more believers that are saved, then Romans 10. 9. which is against sense. 4.
Christ ought not to have spoken to his Disciples as a Church, because he is
directing them as members and parts of a Church, how to deal with an offender:
but if he hear not the Church, that is, Page 158.
the Christian Magistrate, he should die, says Beza. Erastus answers, But
the Church or Jewish Synedrie had not power of life and death now they were
under the Roman Empire.

Ans. Christ here then shows not a way to remove Scandals, because the Roman
Emperors sword is not Christ's Spiritual way, 2 Cor. 10. The weapons of our
warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God.

Erastus. By this same place, I cannot prove there is such a thing Page 156.
157.
as Excommunication, what is said to one is said to the whole Church; but it is
said to one, that he should forgive an offending brother, seventy seven times
in one day, if he acknowledge his fault; Ergo, there can be no just cause why
the whole Church should not do* that which every member is obliged to do,
but your Presbyters will punish though any one should confess his fault.

Ans. There is a twofold forgiving, one private, in passing the A twofold
forgiving.
private revenge of the fault and grudge against the person of the offender:
thus the whole argument is granted, for Members and Church both are to pray,
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive them that sin against us: I hope the
Synedrie, the Roman President, the Magistrate, thus are obliged to forgive
those whose heads they justly take from them, so Luke 17. We are to forgive our
brother seventy seven times a day, though he neither repent nor crave pardon,
but far more, if he crave pardon. But by this Argument the Christian Magistrate
should use the sword against no bloody Parracide, for he is thus to forgive
him, and much more, if he say he repents. 2. To forgive, is to remit all
punishment, and so what is said to one Member of the Church, is not said to the
whole Church. Private men have not power of Church-punishment to forgive it.
The Church has a power limited by Christ, that is to forgive and open heaven,
in so far as they see Christ go before, and see the man penitent, and
therefore Erastus his consequence is short, it follows not, that the Church
should no more excommunicate then one Member. Erastus looks far beside the
book, in that he thinks it is all one to forgive an injury, and to remove a
scandal in the way of Christ in laboring to gain a brother. I may forgive
one that offends me, and not labor at all to gain his soul.

Erastus. We cannot expound (...) against thee, against the These. 42. page 27.
Church, because he says after, tell the Church, then the sense should be, O
Church tell the Church.

Ans. It is not denied by us, but that the Scandal in the rise may be private,
but Erastus will have our Savior to speak only of private Scandals. 2. If
one Church shall offend another, the offended may admonish, and if the Church
be not gained, the offended Church is to tell more Churches Synodically
conveened, as may be gathered from Christ's Scope, to remove all Scandals
between brother and brother, Church and Church.

Erastus. Tell him between thee and him, if it be told me conscio, Page 16.
I only knowing, then he has sinned against me privately; should I not
reprove him before others, if he have sinned against others? but Christ will
not have me to take any Witnesses at the first.

Ans. 1. I may tell him between me and him, a public fault: this proves only
my admonition to be private, when the fault is known to twenty and scandalizeth
them, and it proves not the fault to to be private. But you will say, then I
must take these twenty who are offended, no less then I am to go my self. I
answer, not so; For 1. I may be ignorant that any knows it, and I am not to
uncover what God has covered, except it were a sin that brings wrath on the
whole Land, as blood, and the Canaanites sins. 2. Though I should know twenty
were offended, charity will bid me try, if I only can gain him, and then love
makes the work easier to twenty.

Erastus. But Matthew and Luke compared together, do teach that Christ
speaks of such sins, as one Brother may pardon another seventy seven times;
and the question of Peter to Christ, how often shall my brother offend, and I
forgive him? says that Christ speaks not Christ speaks not of such sins as
private men may forgive as Erastus dreameth.
of the sins, that the Church only can forgive, for Peter knew well, that he
his alone could not forgive these sins, which only the Church and a multitude
can pardon.

Ans. Though it be true, Matthew and Luke c. 17. speak both of scandals and
scandalous sins in general, yet it is evident they speak of two sorts of
scandalls; Luke speaks v. 3. of scandals between brother and brother, which
may at first be taken away by rebukes; but he has nothing of the Churches part
touching these. But Matthew has it at length, chap. 18. ver. 15, 16. 17, 18.
19. 20. The Luke 17. 4. and Matthew more distinctly, chap. 18. ver. 21. upon
the occasion of Peter's question, resolves a case of conscience; how Christians
are to pass by in love the faults one of another, even to seventy times seven;
they are not scandals of one and the same nature, as Erastus conceives: The
former is, how we may gain an offending brother from the guilt of active
scandal in giving offense to us, and that is by free rebuking; and if that
gain him not, then by taking witnesses and rebuking him; and if neither that
can do it, by telling the Church, to which Christ has given a more powerful
way, to bind and loose in earth and heaven, says Matthew: Luke speaks only
of simple rebuking, which tends to the other two. The latter way, is how we
our selves may be freed from passive scandal, if our brother provoke us seven
times, or seventy seven times a day: this must be by a private pardoning, and
laying aside all grudge, or hints of revenge toward our brother, and this is a
great mistake in Erastus, that he confounds those two scandals, which by two
Evangelists are distinguished, for Peter upon occasion of the former
Church-scandals, proposes the second, Mat. 18 21. then came Peter to him, and
said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Peter
asks nothing of gaining the offender, and Christ answers nothing of gaining
him, having satisfied them fully in that before: But Peter came in with a new
question, concerning private forgiving. 2. It is evident in the former, that
Christ speaks not of sins, that one brother may forgive another; for then it
were free to the offended, after two admonitions ineffectuall to gain the
offender, to forgive and desist, as he does in the matter of forgiving: But it
is not free to him to desist; if the offender refuse to be gained, and add
contumacy; the offended cannot pardon the punishment (he ought to remit the
private grudge) he is under a command of Christ to tell the Church, that is one
punishment, and if he yet be obstinate, he is to be reputed as a Heathen and a
Publican, that is another punishment, which a private man cannot dispense with:
1. He cannot dispense with Christ's command. 2. He cannot omit all Lawful means
of gaining the soul of his brother; for the Law of nature tyeth him to it.
Erastus will have it a matter of holding off of an injury, only by complaining
to the Roman Emperor, a carnal way. Christ is on a higher and more spiritual
strain to gain a soul, as is clear, If he hear thee, thou have gained thy
brother, rest there: But if he hear thee not, go yet on to gain him: Take with
thee two or Christ's scope spiritual, Erast. his way is carnal.
three, then if he had been gained at first, a second admonition before two or
three were needless. But if yet he be not gained, then go yet on, to seek the
gaining of his soul; and tell the Church, and if the Church cannot gain him:
then let him be as a Publican, and cast out: This is also a way of gaining,
that his spirit may be saved, 1 Cor. 5. Therefore this is most false, that
Christ speaks of those sins which we may forgive: Who can believe that it is
credible that our Savior has a more noble end, and more excellent then to
gain a brothers soul? or that he does teach us in these words to descend from
such a spiritual end, as the repentance of an offender, to a far baser end, to
hold off injuries by fleeing to a heathen Judicature?

Erastus. Christ speaks of such sins, as the offender cannot deny These. 42.
page 28.
before witnesses. But sins to be punished by Excommunication, so heinous, as
deserves to be delivered to Satan, he would deny; Ergo, he must speak of
smaller sins.

Ans. This is for us, he speaks of such sins that the offender will persist
in, against the Authority of witnesses, Synedrie, or Church and Magistrates, as
Erastus thinks while he be as a Profane Heathen; Ergo, he may deny them: 2.
If we suppose three faithful witnesses, who have seen and heard, such as will
testify the sin before the Church, it is like to be a grievous and public
trespass. Nor would Christ have the Magistrate troubled, and the Church
offended for such sins as may fall out, in a brother, seven times; yea, seventy
seven times in one day, and may be, by private transactions pardoned, as
Erastus says: How should Erastus his civil throne, sink under threescore and
ten scandalls in one day?

Erastus. The Church punishes not the man for such sins, but dismisseth him as
an injurious person.

Ans. True, if we believe Erastus begging the question. 2. To declare Lib. 3.
c. p. 181.
a brother, no brother, but a profane Heathen, without Christ in the world,
and out of the Covenant of Grace, must be the highest Church-censure, and must
be more highly punished then so.

Erastus. I call them light faults only compared with crimes punished by the
Law.

Ans. Such as contumaciously defended, makes a man none of Christ's, but the
prophanest living; yea, of a believing Jew, an Apostate, and a Heathen,
deserves to be punished by the judge.

Erastus. If the offended be willinger to suffer the injury then to compeer
before a heathen judge, he may.

Ans. There be no smell of an Heathen, or Roman Judge in the Text, Id Erastus
adjecit de suo. 2. It is not free to gain, or not gain, my brothers soul, or
obey Christ's command, or not obey it.

Paul, 1 Cor. 6. forbids us to implead our brethren before Heathen Judges;
Erastus says, Christ commands the contrary: Erastus answers, Paul says in
these that are (...) and (...) in smaller matters, as of goods we should not.

Ans. Its true, Paul gives instance, in those that he calls things of this
life, but in opposition to the great matter of Judging the world and Angels: 2.
Paul says generally; Ye go to law one with another, 1 Cor. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4. And
he esteems it such a fault, that he says of it, v. 9. Know ye not that the
unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.

Erastus. Paul himself appealed to a heathen judge Caesar.

Ans. True, but not for small offenses falling out seventy seven times a day,
for which the Magistrate will not punish, such as these offenses be, says
Erastus, page 181. page 28. These. 42. But being accused of a high crime of life
and death. 2. He appealed not from a godly Magistracy, such as the Syned^y
holds forth, but from bloody judges: 3. In matters not with Saints, as 1 Cor.
6. And brethren to whom you are to grant pardons, seven, and seventy seven
times a day, but with Blasphemers, and Murderers of Christ, Act. 18. 6. 1
These. 2. 15.

Erastus. Christ teaches how private injuries may be removed, Page 186. 187.
without offense by the Magistrate, but not how we may reduce to repentance
a brother that gives scandal.

Ans. There Is not a footstep of injuries, or Magistrate, or sword in the Text:
2. ver. 7. And all along he speaks of scandalls that may hinder our entering
to heaven, and these words; rebuke him, Thou have gained thy brother, are clear
as the Sun, that he intends the offended, in all these steps, is to gain the
soul of the offender.

Erastus. This is no Argument at all, he speaks of gaining an offending
brother: Ergo, His scope is not to repair any civil loss: But I pray you, a
brother argues an injurious man, and convinces him of his error; has he not
first gained him to God, and then to himself, while he makes him of his enemy
his friend? can there be a better way of compounding private injuries? if his
conscience be healed, will he not leave off to be injurious?

Ans. I may say, as he says to that Apostolic servant of God, holy Beza,
Egregia vero ratiocinatio: The question is now touching the scope of Christ,
Matthew. 18. Erastus proves repairing of civil injuries to be Christ's scope,
and how proves he it? Because he that is gained to God by repentance, is a
made friend, and will leave off to do civil wrongs: Just as if one should
say, the scope of the holy Ghost, in the history of the Creation, in the two
first chapters of Genesis, is to make the Reader a good Philosopher: Why?
because he that understands the works of Creation, the Heaven, Stars, Sun,
Moon, Seas, dry Land, Trees, Herbs, etc. Must not this man be an excellent
Astronomer, Geographer, Physiloge, etc? So may he say, the scope of the holy
Ghost, in the ten Commandments, is to make a man an excellent Citizen of
London, or Paris, Why? how is that the scope of the ten Commandments? by
Erastus his Argument, What better way can there be to make a good sociall
Civilian, then if he be well versed in the Doctrine of the ten Commandments? so
may I say, the scope of Paul in the first eleven Chapters of the Epistle to the
Romans, is to make a man love his brother, why? Because if he know God, and
free justification by faith in Christ, and our freedom from the Law, and the
Doctrine of Election by Free Grace, and the like, he cannot but love his
brother* Now how can that be Christ's scope, which is neither spoken In
terminis? Nor so much as insinuated? Now to gain an offending brother is In
terminis spoken, ver. 15. Thou have gained thy brother: so Erastus grants
this is Christ's scope, but not his last scope; and gaining of his soul he will
have, but a scope for a civil end to hold off injuries: How carnal is the
glos^e of Erastus? Now the scope of Erastus is never spoken, never hinted at:
Erastus cannot deny our scope, only he will not have it the chief scope of the
words; the best ground he has for his scope is that, Tell the Church, is, Tell
the Civil Magistrate.

Erastus to put a good face on the business, says, scanning on the Page 188.
sense of the words, Christ therefore says rebuke him, Matthew. 18. That we may
understand, that he is to be convinced of his error, and iniquity, that he may
acknowledge it not only to us, and before men, but far more to God, and so
thou have gained thy brother, and lost him, if he refuse to hear thee, that is,
If he suffer not himself to be convinced, and do not acknowledge his fault, he
is bound in Heaven, and this is that which I would say, this gaining of him is
the pardoning (of a civil wrong) that he may be received in friendship.

Ans. If Christ's inten^ion be, that he may rather acknowledge his fault to God
then to the offender, as Erastus grants, then Christ's scope in these words,
must be his spiritual gaining to God, not a civil depulsion of a civil wrong,
but the former* Erastus grants: 2. If spiritual gaining be intended in all
the steps of our Saviors progress, and when this is obtained, the progress
does cease; then means rather crossing and thwarting that scope, then suitable
spiritually thereunto, are not to be attempted: then is not civil depulsion of
injuries our Saviors scope in the words, but the former is true; Ergo, So is
the latter; the Proposition is evident, from the nature of a scope, and end in
any speech. I prove the Assumption by parts. 1. If rebuking of an offending
brother, gain him to repentance, then it is clear the offended man is to rest
there, and not to Tell the Church or Magistrate, for he has obtained even the
end, for which Erastus contendeth, and who goes about new means to compass an
end already obtained? Christ would never command that; yea, when Christ says,
ver. 16. If he hear not thee, then take with thee one or two more; Ergo, If he
had heard him, he was not to take one or two more, and ver. 17. If he should
neglect to hear them, he* was to tell the Church: Ergo, If he should hear them,
he was gained, and was not to tell the Church; Ergo, spiritual gaining must be
Christ's scope. 2. If to tell the Church, be as Erastus dreameth, to tell the
Civil Magistrate, and then the Roman Emperor; this was no suitable mean to
gain the man's soul; a club was never dreamed of by our Savior to compass the
spiritual end, or nearest scope of gaining any to repentance; for the end of
the Magistrate, as a Magistrate, is to bring no man to repentance, but to take
away evil out of the land, to cause Israel fear, and do so no more, to be an
avenger of evil doing, far less is there any shadow of reason to dream that
Christ intended by Cesars, or any Heathen Magistrates sword, to gain an
offending brother to repentance, and that he commands the offended brother to
use such a carnal mean so unsuitable to such a spiritual end. Lastly, How a
private brother cannot be said to bind and loose, I have cleared already.

Erastus. Least these words (Let him be to thee as an Heathen) should seem to
make the offender every way as an Heathen; therefore he adds a restrictive
word, (and a Publican) and he adds the article ^ common to them both, so as
he speaks not of every Heathen and Publican, but of those who were conversant
amongst the Jews, and none of those would answer to any Judge, but the Roman
Emperor or his deputies, being the servants of the Romans, to vex the people
of the Jews.

Ans. Here is a groundless conjecture, for a Publican was large as odious as a
Heathen, being a companion to sinners, and the worst of the Heathen.

2. How proves he that (...), that Heathen is meant of those A Publican most
odious to the Jews.
Heathen only, that were servants to the Romans, and would acknowledge no Judge
but Caesar. 1. The Jews themselves said, We have no King but Caesar: 2. The holy
Ghost does not restrict the Heathen so; What warrant has Erastus to be
narrower in his gloss then the holy Ghost is in the Text. If in these, ( Let
him be as an Heathen) the threatening be perpetual, to remove all scandals, to
the end of the world; when most of the Heathen shall not acknowledge the
Iudicatures of Heathen Rome, then the word Heathen must be as large as all
Heathen, all wicked and all scandalous men, such as Publicans, and so there is
no hint at the Heathen Romish Judge here, which is the way of Erastus. But the
former is true; or this Law of Christ is to remove scandals amongst the
Disciples when the Roman Empire shall fall as the Lord in his word has
prophesied. The Scripture speaks not so, Mat. 6. 7. Use no vain repitition in
prayer. (...), Here is the Article (...): Can Erastus say none use babbling
prayers but such heathen as were subject to the Roman Empire? Gal. 2. 9. That
we should go (...), to the Heathen, here is an Article also; belike Paul
should preach to no Gentiles but those under the Roman Empire: A frothie dream,
Gal. 3. 8. The Scripture foreseeing God would justify (...), the Gentiles.
Here also an Article; belike then no Gentiles are justified by faith, but these
that are Officers to the Romans, and vexed the Jews, Act. 18. 6. Henceforth I
will go (...), to the Gentiles, Act. 21. 19. Paul told what things the Lord
had done by his Ministry (...), amongst the Heathen, Act. 26. 23. that Christ
should show light to the people, (...), and to the Heathen, not the Romish
heathen only, except Christ be a Savior to no other Heathen in the world: I
need not weary the Reader to resute these unsolid conjectures of Erastus.

Erastus. Converted Publicans were not scandalous, as touching Lib. 3. c. 3. p.
190, 191.
their office; Ergo, A publican signifies not one that is none of the Church;
Zachens after his conversion remained a Publican.

Ans. Converted Publicans left not off to be Publicans, but they left off to be
such as went under the name of Publicans; that is, abominable Extortioners and
grinders of the Poor: and therefore it follows well, that to be as a Publican
in the common speech of the Jews familiar to our Savior, was to be a wretched
godless profane man, without the Church, and without God and Christ in the
world, as also the Heathen were, Ephesians. 2. 11, 12. 1 Cor. 5. 1. 1 Pet. 4. 3, 4.
Acts 21. 11. Romans 2. 24 blasphemers of the Name of God, and 1 Cor. 12. 2. Ye
know that ye were Gentiles carried away with dumb Idols, Ephesians. 4. 17. That ye
walk not as other Gentiles, in the vanity of their mind. 18. Having the
understanding darkened, being strangers from the life of God: These and many
other Scriptures confirms me much, that in Christ's time to be as a Heathen
and a Publican, was to be cast out, whereas the man was once a brother, a
believer, and a member of the Church, and in profession in the covenant of God,
and a brother to Peter, John and the Lords Disciples, and a Christian and
professing Saint, as the disciples of Christ were; but now one who is turned
out of that society, and as a Gentile serving Satan, walking in the vanity of
the mind, as an uncircumcised man, etc. This is as like Excommunication, as
one egg is like another, we have clear Scripture for this Exposition, but it
is good Erastus never gave us one syllable of Scripture for his exposition* Nor
can it be shown that to be as a Heathen and a Publican by Scripture, or any
that ever spoke Greek, is to be in subjection to the Roman Empire, or liable
to their laws, only we have (...) of Erastus for it.

Erastus. Who ever by no law of God or command was execrable, Page 191.
and could for no just cause be hated, by no Law of God could be debarred from
the Temple and holy things of God. But such were the Publicans; Ergo,

Ans. 1. The Major is false. The Leper because a Leper was by no Law of God
cursed, and execrable, nor was he worthy of hatred, but of pity; yet was he by
an express Law debarred from the Temple and holy things of God.

2. The Minor is false in the sense we contend for, the office of a Publican in
abstracto was not execrable, nor worthy of hatred: P. 192. 193.
but the thing signified, and that which proverbially went under the name of a
Publican amongst the Jews, to wit, a professed extortioner, a robber, a
grinder of the face of the poor, is both execrable and hateful: the
conclusion in the former sense is granted, and it is nothing against us: But in
the latter sense, the Assumption being false, the conclusion follows not; not
to say that in ordinary, none was a Publican, but he that was either an
heathen, and so execrable, or then an Apostate wretched lewd Jew.

Erastus. But I have demonstrated that no man was debarred from holy things for
Moral uncleanness, then neither should a Publican be counted a separated man,
will Christ command him to be cast out whom the Jews could by no Law cast out?

Ans. If we give the matter to Erastus his word, all he says are
demonstrations: Let the reader read and judge. 2. All his argument here
proceeds on a false ground, while he contendeth so much to justify Publicans
he presumes (to be as a Publican) to ^e in our sense all one with this, (to be
excommunicated.) But 1. we lay the least weight on the word ( Publican) and
more on this, ( to be as an heathen.) 2. We take them not divisively, but as
Christ speaks them, copulatively. We say, not to be excommunicated, is all
one, as, let him be as a Publican, but that to be excommunicated, is to be as
an Heathen (...) and as a Publican.

Erastus. The article ^ is set before both the word (Heathen) and the word
(Publican) by the holy Spirit, which signifies either the very Page 195. 196.
nature of the predicate (heathen and Publican) or must put a great Emphasis,
and a great edge of difference between the Heathen and Publican here, and in
other places, as these be not one, Petrus est, (...), et Petrus est, (...) (
Peter is a man,) and Peter is the man, or that man.) So when we say, pleasure
is that good thing, (...), that chief happiness; We say more then when we say
pleasure is good, so (...) that Publican must signify a Publican, as a
Publican, if there be an Emphasis here common to both the heathen and the
Publican, now there can be no other thing in the matter of eschewing Scandals
common to both, but that both acknowledged no other but the Roman Magistrate,
and therefore, except you make (to be a Publican,) and (to be debarred from the
Sacraments) all one; you have not another place in all the New Testament for
your Excommunication, for no Publican because a Publican, was debarred by Gods
Law, Jure divino, from the Sacraments.

Ans. 2. All the wits on earth cannot make us see another place for Erastus his
explication of this place Matthew. 18. and of 1 Cor. 5. But we hope it shall
appear we have more from Scripture, to say for Excommunication then this one
place, or then Erastus and all his party can say against it; here is all that
Erastus can say against this strong place, builded upon one Article ^; a poor
and ignorant Grammattication. 1. He culleth out the word ( Publican) of less
weight with us, from the word ( Heathen) and would prove that no Publican
because a Publican, and for the office, was debarred from the Jewish
Sacraments, which we grant; for no office or place lawful in it self,
debarred any from* Christ; Centurions were hateful to the Jews, and put over
them by the Romans, A publican most odious to the Jews.
yet I should conceive the Centurion, whose servant Christ cured, Luke 7. was a
Proselite, and a member of the Jewish Church, a lover of the Nation, else I see
not how the Jews would have accepted that he should build them a Synagogue, as
he did v 5. and Publicans might have bin Proseli^es also, but that which was
signified by a Publican to the Jews, was no less odious then the name of a
hangman or a most wicked and flagitio^s man, as Matthew. 5. 45, 46, 47. and by
Christ decourted from the number of the children of our heavenly Father:
Amongst the Jews it was counted abomination to eat with Publicans, Matthew. 9.
11. Matthew. 11. 19. Luke 7. 34. And when Christ says, Matthew. 21. 31. of the
Rebellious Jews; Verily, I say unto you, that (...), the publicans and harlots
shall enter into the Kingdom of God before you: He clearly makes Publicans the
wickedst of men* shall these two, (...) make us think Erastus were not
dreaming, if he should from these words gather that Christ, means only of
such Publicans and Harlots as acknowledged no other Magistrate, but the Roman
Magistrate? And the Article (...) is doubled in the following verse also. 2.
Let us retort this Argument, he that hears not the admonitions of brethren in
secret, and of the Church in public, is to be reputed, not as a Jew, or a
brother and member of the Church having right to the holy things of God, but as
a Heathen.

Now a Heathen to the Jews was no brother, and had no right to the Sacraments,
either of the Jewish, or Christian Church, as is clear by the word of God,
therefore he that hears not a brother in secret, or the Church in public, is
to be reputed as no brother (I mean in that public visible way he once was)
but as a Heathen, who has no right, Iure divino, by Gods Law to the
Sacraments. 3. What means all this trifling about the Article:? Say that the
Article; should restrict Heathens and Publicans, to such and such Heathens and
Publicans: I shall deny, In eternum, this consequence, Ergo, He means no other
but only such Heathens and Publicans, as did acknowledge no other Magistrate,
but a Roman Magistrate. There is no shadow in the Scripture, or any Greek
author for the Word, but rather (...) signifies the quality and spiritual
condition of any, especially when Christ speaks of gaining of souls, as here,
Mat. 18. 15. so I am sure (...) signifies Ioh. 1. 14. Man. 6 ^0. 1 Pet. 1. 19.
so does (...) signify Mat. 6. 5. and elsewhere, enough I deny not but it may
signify a civil or natural si^^^^tude, but Christ does here speak of
neither, as is clear. 4. If here a Publican as a Publican be meant, as Erastus
says; Ergo, All Heathens and all Publicans are here to be understood; Ergo,
Not these only that had this common to them both, to wit, that they both
acknowledged no civil Magistrate but the Romans, the contrary of which Erastus
asserteth. 5. Yea, this is not emphatick and discretive of Heathen and
Publican, Christ acknowledged no civil Judge as King over the Jews at this
time but only Caesar, when he said Mat. 22. Give unto Caesar, the things that
are Cesars, and to God the things that are Gods. And the Jews themselves did
so when they said, We have no King but Caesar; If then to be as an Heathen and a
Publican, be all one as to acknowledge no King, nor judge but Caesar, then to
be as a Heathen and Publican, must be all one with this, to be as Christ and
the Jews, for this was common to Heathens, Publicans, Jews and Christ, to
acknowledge Caesar was their only King and civil Judge. 6. They were the worst
of the Heathens and Publicans, who in a peculiar manner acknowledged no lawful
Judge but Caesar, and hated the Jews, the only Church of God most at this
time; Ergo, If the Article (...) infer that a disobedient brother is most
like these Heathen, they must be greatest enemies to the Jews, and so remotest
from Circumcision, and all right to the holy things of God, being the worst of
the Heathen, and so Erastus has gained nothing, but lost much by his poor
Grammattication. Yea, if the offended brother should repute the offender as the
worst of the Heathen, he is to esteem him who was once a Member of the Church,
in that he was obliged to hear the Church, now as a Heathen, and so no
brother, no Member of the Church, and here Erastus must grant that one brother
may un-church and Excommunicate any other for disobedience to the Church, but
the Church may not.

Erastus. They are as absurd who say, by Publicans here are understood wicked
men, for then by Heathen must be understood also the wickedest of the Heathen,
and not all the Heathen dwelling in Judea.

Ans. I deny the consequence, for by Publicans are meant men wicked and unpure
by conversation, and by Heathen men unclean by condition, because without the
Church, and strangers to the Israel of God, and without Christ and God in the
world. 2. We have proved what is meant by a Publican, by evident Scriptures,
but that by a Publican is understood one who acknowledged no Magistrate, but a
Roman, no Scripture; no Greek Author warranteth us to think it, never man
dreamed it, but Erastus.

Erastus. The Pharisees hindered not Christ and his Apostles to come to the
Temple.

Ans. Christ was a born Jew and circumcised; yea, and what can the Practice of
the Murderers of Christ prove? It is no Law. But the Romans never sacrificed
in the Temple, but gave Liberty to the Jews to serve God, according to his
word, and to hear Christ preach, and that Christ kept the Ceremonial Law, and
taught others, even the cleansed Leapers so to do, Matthew. 8. is clear.

Erastus. Private men do forgive, sins. Matthew. 18. Luke 17. Ergo, No private
forgiveness, Mat. 18.
to bind and loose is not a proper judicial act of a Court, Matthew. 16. Christ
speaks not to Peter only, but to all the faithful, who by teaching one
another, may bring one another to acknowledge their sin, and if they do it they
are pardoned, if not, their sins are bound in Heaven.

Ans. To these the keys are given, who retain and remit sins, as page 198. ^ed
si docendo (pri^atus) aliquem ad duxcrit, ut peccata sua agnoscat, et ex certa
side ^^ Dei be ^^gnitate propter meritum Christi acquiescat, an non solutus
erit? Si frustra^ moneat ac doceat, an non qui^sic perti^aciter salutem re
pudiat, ^^gatus.
Erastus says: But these be such as are sent of Christ, as the Father sent his
son, Ioh. 20. 2. Either in this place there is given power to bind and loose
by public preaching the word, or by some other place; but this power to bind
and loose by public preaching, is only given to Pastors and Teachers, 1 Cor.
12. 29. Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. And Erastus grants elsewhere, that every private man
by his office cannot preach, nor administer the Sacraments, and by no other
place is this given to Pastors, for I could elude all places, with the like
answer, and say there is a public Baptizing and Administration of the Supper,
by Ministers and sent Pastors only, and a private also performed by private
Christians; yea, by a woman, and both are valid in Heaven, and the binding and
loosing of both ratified in Heaven. 3. Christ spoke this to the Disciples, who
before were sent to Preach, and cast out Devils, Matthew. 10. and says not, Whom
thou binds on earth, but in the plural number, (...), What things you bind
on earth, shall be bound in Heaven. Erastus says all this upon the fancy, that
binding and loosing of the Church, and Peter's private forgiving of his brother
seven times a day must be all one, which I do prove in another place to be
different, and amongst other reasons this is one, because the Church pardoning
has a threefold order: 1. between brother and brother: 2. before two or three:
3. Before the Church, and the end of all is the gaining of the offending
brother, Matthew. 18, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. But the private forgiving of a
brother, of which Peter speaks, Mat. 18. 21, 22, 23. and Luke 17 4, 5. is of
an inferior nature; for I know not, if you can gain a brothers soul seven
times a day, if he but say, It repents me, Luke 17. 4. or seventy seven
times, Mat. 18. 22. These words, It repents me, said seventy times a day to
the Church cannot satisfy to the gaining of a soul, whereas to the private
remitting of revenge, it were enough. We have the Text to warrant us, that
Christ spa^e to Stewards to whom the keys are committed. Erastus does but
wickedly assert, he spoke to those who were as Christians in that act, but the
Text is clear he speaks of binding and loosing spiri^ually, which Binding
and loosing proper to Stewards.
is nothing to the holding off of a civil injury, which Erastus says is the
scope of our Savior here, and how hungry must that sense be: That you deal
with him as with an Heathen, who acknowledges no Judge, but a Roman judge, is
a matter ratified in heaven? 4. A private man is to forgive an injury even
though the offender repent not, Mat. 14. 15. Romans 12. 19, 20. Col. 3. 13. but
that pardon cannot be ratified in heaven. 5. See what we have said of binding
and loosing before.

Erastus. Though Christ should speak this only to Ministers, yet it follows
not that he speaks this to other Presbyters.

Ans. That depends on the proving that there be ruling Elders in the Church,
which I conceived have proved else where, from Romans 12. 8. 1 Cor. 12. 28. 1 Timothy 5. 17. I conceive when Christ spoke this, there was neither a formed
Presbytery, nor a formed Church.

Erastus. Christ says not, if two or three Presbyters, or two or three Page
199.
Ministers agree in one, I will hear them, but where two or three Christians
agree.

Ans. Nor do we say, that two or three can make an Excommunicating Church, but
Christ argues a minore, if the Lord hear two or three on earth, far more
will he hear a Church, and ratify in heaven what they do in binding and
loosing offenders in Earth; But how shall these words agree to the
interpretation of Erastus? for he expounds two or three and the whole Church,
to be but one Christian Magistrate; can he be said to agree to himself? Or can
one or two or three meet together in Christ's Name? And what coherence is here?
Two or three conveeneth to pray that he that will not hear the Christian
Magistrate may be dealt with as a Heathen man before the Roman judge, how
violent and far off is this gloss, and how unsuitable to the Text?

Erastus. What other thing is it to a private brother, to gain another Page 199.
to himself, and to God, then binding and loosing in Heaven?

Ans. To bring him before the civil Magistrate either Christian or Heathen,
whose intrinsecall end by virtue of their office, is not to gain, souls, but
to draw the blood of ill doers, is far from gaining of Souls.

Erastus. Though binding and loosing be judicial and forinsecall words, they
agree not to the Ministry only, but rather to the Magistrate, except you say
that in the time of Christ amongst the Jews, there was a Church court beside
the Magistrates court.

Ans. That they argue authority judicial, is proved already by many
Scriptures, and judicial authority Ecclesiastical it must be, which agrees
to the Church, and it was never heard that the Church especially in the New
Testament, does signify the Magistrate. 2. There is no necessity to say there
was a Christian Church court in Christ's time, because there was not a Christian
Magistrate at this time, but the Jews had then a Church-court, before which
Christ was conveened. Caiphas being President, and the blind man, John 9. who
was cast out of the Synagogue, for that he confessed Christ. 3. Christ speaks
of that which was to be, though in its frame not yet erected.

Erastus. Christ has the like words of binding and loosing, Mat. 16. which
signifies also to preach the Gospel, that he who believes may be loosed, and
he who believes not may be made inexcusable, and therefore it is no other, but
to pray a brother to desist from his injury, showing him that that is
acceptable to God: for to bind and loose in all the Scripture, is never to
debar any from the Sacraments; if you divert your brother from doing an
injury, by declaring the will and wrath of God, out of his Word, thou have
gained him, and loosed him, if he will not be persuaded, the wrath of God
abides on him, and thou have bound him.

Ans. If loosing and binding Matthew. 16. be preaching of the Word of God, and
loosing be Christian forgiving of an injury, then are women who are taught in
the prayer of Christ, Mat. 6. to forgive one another, invested with the keys
of the Kingdom of Heaven, to preach the Gospel; and why not also to
administer the Seals? and so are all private men clothed with the keys to take
in and cast out at their pleasure, and what are Ministers that are over the
people in the Lord, and watch for their souls? 2. We never said, to bind was
to debar from the Sacraments, except consequently only, to bind, is to
declare an obstinate man as a Heathen, and so no member of the house of Christ,
and consequently to have no right to the bread of the children of the house,
nor say we, that to Excommunicate is formally to debar men from the
Sacraments, it is to cast them out of the house: hence it must To Excommunicate
is not formally to debar from the Seals.
follow that the privileges of the house belongs not to them. 3. You may
dissuade a man from doing a civil injury, and never gain his soul, but the
Magistrates club, for which Erastus contendeth in these words, cannot reach the
soul.

Erastus. None can remit a debt but the creditor, nor pardon an injury but he
who suffers the injury.

Ans. Then none can bind and loose but private men, and the keys of heaven
are given to all private persons, nor can private persons by forgiving, so
remit the person as he is loosed in heaven. 2. The Church is offended at
Scandals, and are sufferers; Ergo, The Church must bind and loose: Let Erastus
teach us the way except by Church Censures.

Erastus. Casting out of the unclean is not to bind, because to purify Page
201.
is not to absolve, the unclean might be purified by any clean, and not by the
Priests only.

Ans. The legal purging of the Leper, was only by pronouncing him* clean,
and could not be done but by the Priest, and it was a loosing of him.

Erastus. Where Christ instituteth any new ordinance, he omitteth Page 203.
nothing that is substantial, but here he speaks nothing of public sins,
for which you do especially excommunicate.

Ans. Christ according to the mind of Erastus does here institute a throne for
the Christian Magistrate, how does he then institute a way how the Christian
Magistrate may remove private Scandals and not public? for public Scandals
hurt the Church ten to one more then private do. Christ speaks of sins in
their rise private, between brother and brother, but he speaks of public
Scandals, of such as will not hear the Church, and for these only we
Excommunicate. 2. Tha^ is not true, that any one place of Scripture, where an
institution is that all the substantials of that institution, should be
expressly set down in that place, it is enough that all be held forth in either
one Scripture, or other, as in Christ's sufferings, Baptism, Pastors, etc.

Erastus. (...) Again I say unto you, if two of you shall agree on earth, these
words must refer to private men, not to the Church, it is clear that Christ
speaks nothing of two, as he does in this verse, but when he says that one
private man is to rebuke and gain another private man; nor is it enough to say
its an Page 203. 204.
argument a comparatis, for if the same thing be not kept in both extremes, it
is a vain comparison if you say a child understands this; Ergo, An aged man
understands it, it follows well. But if you say a child understands this;
Ergo, An aged man is rich and good; who would not laugh? But if God hear the
prayer of two; Ergo, far more will he hear the prayers of the Church, it
follows not, except you say, if those things that two or three binds on
earth be ratified, how shall we think, that that is ratified which the Church
binds and looses?

Ans. Here is nothing but Grammatications that cannot convince: it is true,
that Christ speaking of two, he speaks of private men, but many will not
grant so much, for they say, that by two the smallest number is meant, a Church
of the fewest, by a Synecdoche, and two may be taken for a small convention and
number which do literally exceed two, Jer. 3. 14. Rev. 11. 3. I will give
power to my two Witnesses; they be more Martyrs who witnessed against Babylon
then two literally, and this Exposition seems to me as good as the other, and
then if the smallest Church do bind and loose in heaven and earth, so much
more the Church; and so all shadow of this unsolid Grammattication is removed.
2. The proportion is well kept, if two praying on Earth be so heard in Heaven,
as by their prayers, they may obtain that these be ratified in Heaven which
they ask on earth; far more is that ratified in heaven, which the Church in
a judicial and authoritative way, does on earth, in the Name of Christ: for
praying of private Christians, and public and authoritative binding of the
Church do both agree in this, that the Father of Christ ratifieth both in
heaven, which is a due keeping of proportion, and not such a crooked comparison
as Erastus would make between an aged man, and a rich and good man 3. Though
two private men have the same Analogicall binding in Heaven and earth with the
Church, it follows not that the binding of the Church is not a
Church-binding, as the binding of the two private men is also a binding, but no
public, no Churchbinding. 4. How shall Christ's words keep either sense or
Logic with the exposition of Erastus? If he will not hear the Christian
Magistrate, complain to the Heathen Magistrate; and again I say, if the Lord
hear two praying on earth, far more will he ratify in Heaven, what a profane
Heathen Magistrate does on earth against a Christian offender; judge what sense
is in this gloss.

Erastus has no reason to divide these words, ver. 19. Again I say, if two
agree, etc. from ver. 17. 18. Because they are meant of the Magistrate (says
Erastus) against all sense, and join them to the words of the. 15. and 16.
verses: for there is no mention of binding and loosing by prayer, ver. 15, 16.
But only of rebuking, and here Erastus shall be as far from keeping his
proportion, of rebuking and praying, as he says, we do keep proportion between
Church-sentencing and praying. To Theophylact Chrisostom and Augustine, Beza
answered well, and Erastus cannot reply: 6. If there be binding and loosing
between brother and brother in the first and second Admonition, before the
cause be brought to the Church, what need is there of binding the man as a
Heathen before the Heathen Magistrate? And what need of the Heathen Magistrates
prayer to bind in Heaven? Was there ever such Divinity dreamed of in the world?

Erastus. These words, Tell the Church prove only that the Church These. 44. 29.
has the same power to rebuke the injurious man, that a private man has,
this then is poor reason: The Church has power to rebuke an offender; Ergo, it
has power to Excommunicate him.

Ans. All know that Christ ascends in these three steps: 2. Erastus grants
the cause is not brought to the Church, but by two or three witnesses which is
a judicial power, as in the Law of Moses and in all Laws is evident: if he
hear not a brother, he is not to be esteemed, as a Heathen and a Publican, but
if he hear not the Church, he is to be reputed so. 3. We reason never from
power of rebuking to the power of Excommunication; but thus, The Church has
power to rebuke an offender, and if he will not hear the Church, then is the
man to thee, that is, to all men, as a Heathen and a Publican; Ergo, The Church
has power to Excommunicate.

Erastus. Christ speaks of the Church that then was: How could These. 46. page
32.
he bid them go to a Church that was not in the world; they having heard
nothing of the constitution of i^? did he bid them erect a new frame of
Government, not in the world?

Ans. He could as well direct them to remove scandals for time to come, as he
could after his Resurrection say, Mat. 28. 19, 20. Go teach and baptize all
Nations, which commandment they were not presently to follow, but Act. 1. 4. to
stay at Jerusalem, and not To teach all Nations, while the Holy Ghost should
come: I ask of Erastus, how Christ could lay a Ministry on his Disciples,
which was not in the world? What directions does Christ, Mat. 24. and Luke 21.
give to his Church and Disciples that they had not occasion to Christ might
well give directions for a Church not yet erected.
obey many years after? is how they should behave themselves, when they should
be called, before Kings and Rulers: 2. Nor were the Apostles who were already
in the room of Priests and Prophets to Teach and Baptize (he after being to
institute the other Sacrament) to wonder at a new form already half
instituted, and which differed not in nature from the former Government, save
that the Ceremonies were to be abol^shed.

Erastus. Only Matthew mentions this pretended new institution, Lib. 3. cap.
3. p. 196. Vestra igitur excommunicatio nihil aliud est, quam inan^ sigmentum
hominum imperare, aliis cupie^tium.
not Luke, not Mark, the Disciples understood him well, they ask no questions
of him, as of a thing unknown, only Peter asked how often he should forgive his
brother.

Ans. This will prove nothing, John has much which we believe with equal
certainty of Faith, as we do any Divine institutions; shall therefore Erastus
call the turning of water into wine, the raising of Lazarus: The healing of the
man, born blind, and of him that lay at the Pool of Bethesda, Christ's heavenly
Sermons, Io^. cap. 14. 15, 16. his prayer* cap. 17* which the other Evangelists
mention not, Fi^men^a hominum, men's fancies, as he calls Excommunication? 2.
Did the Disciples understand well the dream that Erastus has on the place, and
took they it as granted, that to tell the Church is to tell the civil
Magistrate? And that not to hear the Church is civil Rebellion, and to be as a
Heathen is to be impleaded before Caesar or his Deputies only? This is a wonder
to me; Matthew sets up this way, an institution of all Church Government,
which no Evangelist, no word in the Old, or New Testament establishes.

Erastus. Christ would not draw his disciples, who were otherwise These. 48. 34,
35.
most observant of the Law, from the Synedry then in use, to a new Court, where
witnesses are led before a multitude and sentences judicially set up, it had
been much against the Authority of the civil Magistrate, and a scandal to the
Pharisees, and the people had no power in Christ's time to choose their own
Magistrate, therefore he must mean the Jewish Synedry: If by the Church we
understand the multitude, we must understand such a multitude as has power to
choose such a Senate, but there was no such Church in the Jews at this time.

Ans. That the Church here is the multitude of Believers, men, women, and
children, is not easily believed by us. 2. And we are as far from the dream of
a mere civil Synedry, which to me is no suitable mean of gaining a soul to
Christ, which is our Saviors intention in the Text. 3. Erastus sets up a
christian Magistrate to intercept causes and persons, to examine, rebuke, lead
witnesses against a Jew before ever Caesar their only King of the Jews, or his
Deputies hear any such thing, this is as far against the only supreme
Magistrate, and as scandalous to the Pharisees, as any thing else could be: 4.
Had not John Baptist, and Christ's disciples drawn many of the Jews and
Profylites to a new Sacrament of Baptism, and to the Lamb of God, now in his
flesh, present amongst them? this was a more new Law, then any Ordinance of
Excommunication was, especially since this Church was not to be in its full
constitution, till after the Lords Ascension.

Erastus. It is known this anedrim delivered Christ bound unto Pilate,
condemned Steven, commanded the Apostles to be scour^e^ and put in Prison.
Tertullins says of Paul before Felix, we would have judged him according to
our Law; Paul said, Act. 23. to Anani^s, thou sit to judge me according to
the Law, Act. 26. P^ul confesses before Agrippa and Festus, that he obtained
power from the high Priests, to hale to prison and beat the Christians, and
Paul for fear of the iniquity of this Church or Sanedrim, dealt with them as
Heathen, and appealed to Caesar. Ans. But by what Law of God did they this? It
is not denied but the Jews Synedrim being two courts did inflict punishment;
But that Christ establishes a civil Sanedrim as a mean, Matthew. 18. To gain
the soul of a brother is now the question; we utterly deny this, and gave
reasons before thereof, to which I add, if any obeyed not the Church, that is,
the Sanedrim, as Erastus says, they might be stoned to death as Steven was:
Was this Christ's mild way, to cite them only before the Roman Senate? Were
dead men capable of answering to any further Iudicatures? 2. The last step of
conveening Heathens and Publicans before the Roman Senate, according to
Christ's order is not to be observed with them, for even Heathens and Publicans,
are so far forth our brethren: that 1. We are not, when they offend us, to
suffer sin in them, but to rebuke them as Christians, Lev. 19. 18. For this is
the Law of nature: The Law of nature will teach us not to hate an Heathen in
our heart. 2. We are to labor to gain all, even those that are without the
Church, 1 Cor. 9. 19, 20, 21, 22. 1 Pet. 3. 1. And this is Christ's way of
gaining all, to rebuke and admonish them: Ergo, it was never Christ's meaning to
deal with Heathens and Publicans so, as at the first we are to drag them before
the Heathen Magistrate, that by his sword he may gain them, or take away their
life; yea, and Erastus grants in Ecclesiastical crimes, that the Jews had
power of life and death, in the matter of Steven and of Paul, if he had not
appealed to Caesar to save his head: Josephus de bell. Judaic. Lib. 5. Cap. 26.
Antiquit. Lib. 14. Cap. 12. But in things politic, Caesar took all power of
life and death from them: Hence only is Christ's time the footsteps of the two
distinct courts remained, and the Priests, not the civil Magistrate had the
power of Church Discipline. But all was now corrupt.

Quest. 5. The 1 Cor. 5. vindicated from Erastus his gloss. Lib. 3. c. 4. page
211, 212.

The place 1 Cor. 5. for Excommunication, vindicated from the Objections of
Erastus.

Erastus. Paul did nothing contrary to the Command of Christ: But Christ
excluded no man from the Passover, not Judas; Ergo, Neither minded ^e to
exclude the incestuous man; he says not, 1 Cor. 5. Why debarred you him not
from the Sacrament? But why did you not obtain by your tears and prayers, as
Augustine expounds it, that the man might be cut off by death?

Ans. Christ would not take the part of a visible Church on him, to teachus
that none should be cast out of the Church for secret and latent crimes: 2.
Paul did nothing without the Command of Christ: But Christ neither in the Old,
or New Testament, commanded his Church to pray for the miraculous cutting off
of a scandalous person; give an instance in all Scripture, except you make this
one which is contraverted, your instance.

Erastus. Paul 2 Cor. 2. absolveth the man from all punishment, Page 214.
and names only (...) rebuking; Ergo, He was not excluded from the Sacrament.

Ans. Exclusion from the Sacrament, is but one of the fruits of
Excommunication; not formally Excommunication; yet he harpeth on this always,
that to be excommunicated, or to be delivered to Satan, is but to be debarred
from the Sacrament. 2. The answer presupposes he was Excommunicated, we urge
the place for a precept only of Excommunication, if he repented to the
satisfying of the Church, there was no need of Excommunication. 3. If the man 2
Cor. 2. was delivered from rebuke only, and if that was all his punishment;
Ergo, he was not miraculously cut off, for then he must have been miraculously
cut off, and raised from death to life again, unless miraculous cutting off
had been no punishment: But if he was not miraculously cut off, because he
prevented it, then with what faith could the whole Church pray for the
miraculous killing of a brother, and not rather that he might repent and live?
4. In all the Word of God, the intrinsecall end of putting to death a
Malefactor, is to avenge Gods quarrel, Romans 13. 4. That all Israel may hear
and fear, and do no more any such wickedness, Deuteronomy. 13. 11. To put away the
guilt of sin off the Land, Numb. 34. 33, 34. that the Lords anger may be
turned away, and a common plague on the Church stayed, when justice is executed
on the ill doer, Psalm. 106. 28, 29, 30, 31. And it concerns the Church and
Commonwealth, more then the soul of the Malefactor, and there is nothing of
such an end here. But the intrinsecall end here, is, that the man's Spirit may
be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus, and this delivering to Satan is in the
Name and authority, and by the power of the Lord Jesus, 1 Cor. 5. 4. 5. Now the
The prayers of the Church interveen not for this particular miracle.
Son of man came to save souls, not to destroy bodies, and burn cities; and
though by the power of Christ, Peter miraculously killed Ananias and Saphira,
and Paul stroke Elimas the Socererer blind, yet these being Miracles, we hear
not that this was done by any interveening act of the Church conveened, or by
their prayers to bring vengeance, by a miracle, on the ill do^r. Peter and Paul
do both these not asking any consent, or intervention of the peoples prayers,
but by immediate power in themselves from the Lord Jesus. 2. If any such power
were given to the Church, by their Prayers to obtain from God a miraculous
killing of all scandalous persons, who infecteth the Church, in case the civil
Magistrate were an Heathen, and an enemy to Christian Religion and refused to
purge the Church; Christ, who provideth standing remedies for standing diseases
must have left this miraculous power to all the christian Churches in the earth
that are under Heathen Magistrates, or some power by way of Analogy like to
this, to remove the scandalous person, but we find not any such power in the
Churches under Heathen Magistrates, except power of refusing to the offender
the Communion, and rejecting him as an Heathen and Publican that he may be
ashamed and repent. 3. The whole faithful at Corinth, men, women and children
and all the Saints (for to those all, i^ this power given, as Erastus says)

Corinth.
have had a word of promise (if they ought to have prayed in faith as the
Prophets and Apostles prayed in faith, that they might work miracles) that Paul
was miraculously to kill the incestuous man* But that all and every one who
were puffed up, and mourned not at this man's fall, had any such word of promise
I conceive not imaginable by the Scriptures, for the Proposition I take it as
undeniable; if Paul rebuked the Corinthians all and every one, because they
prayed not, and mourned not to God, that Paul wrought not this miracle in
killing the incestuous man, they behoved to have a word of God, for their
warrant, commanding them to pray: O Lord give power to Paul, to kill such* an
incestuous man miraculously: For such Faith of miracles had Christ, and all the
Prophets and Apostles, Joh. 11. 41. So did Sampson pray in faith, Judge. 16. 28.
and Elias 1 Kings 18. 36, 37, 38. and so did the Apostles pray, Act. 4. 24, 29,
30. and with them the Church of believers, for working of miracles in general;
for the Apostles had a word of promise in the general for working of miracles,
Mar. 16. 17, 18. But that the Apostles had before hand revealed to them all the
miracles they were to work: I cannot believe by any Scripture, But that it was
revealed to them upon occasion only, by an occasional immediate Revelation, Do
this particular miracle, Hic and nunc: And this I am confirmed to believe:
Because Elisha, 2 Kin. 4. was mistaken in sending his servant with his staff
to raise the dead son of the Shunamite (a Pastor with nothing but a club and
naked words cannot give life to the dead) ver. 31. and therefore the working of
a miracle in particular Hic and nunc was not always revealed to the most
eminent Prophets, such as Elisha was; and so I believe, as working of miracles
on this; and this man, came not from an habit in the Prophets and Apostles, far
less from a habit subject to their free will, but God reserved that liberty to
himself, to act his servants immediately, both to pray by the faith of this
miracle, Hic and nunc, and to work this miracle, Hic and nunc. Now to the
Assumption: How can Erastus or any of his followers assure our conscience that
God had given the Faith of miracles to all the sanctified in Christ Jesus at
Corinth, whom Paul so sharply rebukes, 1 Cor. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. That this
being revealed to them by God, and they having the faith, that it was the will
of Jesus Christ, that Paul should kill, or (as some say) deliver to Satan this
incestuous man to be miracuously tormented in the body or flesh, as Job was,
that he might repent; is it like Christ would reveal more of his will, touching
every particular miracle to be done by Paul, to all and every secure one in the
Church of Corinth that were puffed up, and mourned not for this man's fall, then
he revealed to the Apostles themselves? But I have proved that the Apostles and
Prophets knew not, nor had they the particular Faith of this, and this miracle,
how then had all and every one of the Church of Corinth this Faith? Now they
behoved to have this light of Faith of this miracle revealed to them, that this
was Christ's will, that Paul should work a miracle for the destruction of the
man; else the Corinthians could no more be justly rebuked, because they prayed
not to God, that Paul might work this miraculous destruction of the man (which
yet he never wrought, as its clear, 2. Cor. 2. he was not killed, but repented,
and was pardoned) then because they prayed not, that he miraculously might cure
the criple man at Lystra, Act. 14. or that he might work any other miracle. Now
how was this revealed to all of the Church of Corinth that this was Christ's
will? If it be said, they were to pray conditionally that God would either by a
miracle take him away, or then in mercy Delivering to Satan not miraculous.
give him repentance to prevent destruction: 1. We have no surer ground for a
conditional and dis-junctive Faith of miracles in the Corinthians, then for an
absolute Faith: 2. If it was the will of Christ, that the man should by himself
be miraculously killed, why did not the Apostle immediately by himself kill him?
Why? It was the Apostles fault as well as the sin of the Corinthians, that the
man remained as a leaven to sour and infect the Church; yea, it was more the
Apostles fault then theirs, for he had only the immediate power miraculously to
purge the Church; some may say, as the Lord Jesus was hindered some time to work
miracles, because of the peoples unbelief, Matthew. 13. 58. So here Paul was
hindered to work this miracle on the scandalous man, because of their unbelief.

Ans. Paul could not profess this; for he had not assayed to work any miracle
of this kind, as Christ had done, Matthew. 13. But only shows them of a report
came to him of the fact, and of their security, and not mourning: 2. Paul
should then rather have rebuked their unbelief, and not praying that God would
miraculously destroy the man; but this Paul does not. 3. Paul rebukes them,
for not judging him, not putting him out of the midst of them: Must that be
Paul's meaning; pray to God that I may have grace and strength immediately from
God, to kill him miraculously, and to judge him. Now they knew the Apostle
miraculously thus judged those that are without, as he stroke with blindness;
Elymas who was without the visible Church: I conceive the whole Churches were
to pray, as the Apostles do with the Saints, Act. 4. 29. 30. That miracles may
be wrought both on those that are without and within: But of this judging he
says, ver. 12. What have I to do to judge them also that are without? Do not
ye judge them that are within? 4. It is directly contrary to Christ's direction,
Matthew. 18. Which is, that by rebukes we gain the offending brothers soul: Now
Erastus will have him gained to Christ, by removing his soul from his body,
and by killing him. Yea, the Apostle writing of the censuring of those in
Thessalonica, who walked unorderly, and obeyed not the Apostles Word, which
does include such as break out in Incest, Adulteries, Murders, is so far
from giving direction to kill them miraculously, that he bids only keep no
Church company, nor Christian fellowship with them, but yet they are to be
admonished as brethren; Ergo, they were not to be miraculously killed, for then
they should be capable of no admonition at all being killed; And could there be
worse men then was amongst the Phillipians, Enemies of the cross of Christ,
whose end is destruction, whose God was their belly? Yet there was no blood in
the Apostles pen, he chides not the Phillipians, nor the Galathians who had
amongst them men of the same metal, Gal. 5. 7, 8, 9, 10. Ver. 19. 20, 21. Nor
the Timothies who would have to do with far worse men, 2 Timothy, 3. 1, 2, 3, 4,
5. Nor Titus who had to do with wicked Cretians, Tit. 1. because they cried
not to God, for Paul's bloody sword of vengeance, that these wicked men might
be cut off by Satan, nor does the Apostle to the Hebrews draw this Sword
against those who sinned against the Holy Ghost, c. 10. c. 6. Nor James against
bloody warriors, Murderers, Adulterers, Oppressors, c. 4. c. 5. Nor does
Peter and Jude use this sword, or command the Churches to use such carnal
weapons against the wickedest of men, but recommended long-suffering, rebuking,
the rod of Church Discipline, to reject Heretics after admonitions. Hence I
argue negatively; in all the Scripture, never did the Lord command that they
should pray to God and mourn, that he would inflict bodily vengeance and
death, or yet sickness on any scandalous professor, nor is there promise,
precept, or practice in any Scripture of this Church censure. 5. Erastus does
think a court of the Church, that has power to lead Witnesses, judge and
censure offenders an extreme wronging of the Magistrate, and an incroaching on
his Liberties, but here is a more bloody Court, for if the whole faithful are
to pray for bodily death by the Ministry of the Devil, upon one of their own
brethren, because he has lain with his fathers wife, or fallen in Adultery, or
Murder, as David did: Surely they must pray in faith, and upon certain
knowledge that he is guilty; the Law of God and Nature must then have warranted
the whole Saints, Women and Children, to meet in a grand Jurie and Inquest,
either to have the fact proved by Witnesses, or to hear his own confession;
else how could they pray in faith, if it was not sure to their conscience that
the man had done this deed? Here is a Jury of men and women, I am sure unknown
to the Apostolic Church. 2. A greater abridging of the Magistrates power then
we teach: The Church shall take away the life of a Subject and never ask the
Magistrates leave. 6. It is against Christ's mind, Mat. 18. ^s Erastus
expounds it, that Christians should go any further against an offending
brother, then implead him before an Heathen, though he add injury to injury:
But this wa^ makes the Holy Ghost sharply to rebuke all the Saints when they
are off^^ded, before the bar of Heaven, by crying miraculous blood^e
vengeance upon the Offender. 7. It is evident this man repen^ed, and that the
Corinthians confirmed their love to him, and did forgive him, 2 Cor. 2. 7. 10.
Ergo, He was not miraculously killed. But we never read, where it was Gods will
and Law that an ^ll doers life should be spared, though he should repent,
because his taking away is for example that others may fear. 2. That evil,
and as it is here, leaven may be taken away; if then it had been bodily death,
I see not how Paul and the Corinthians could have dispensed with it. 8. Erastus
does not, nor can he confirm his unknown Exposition by any parallel Scripture
of the Old and New Testament, which I objected to him in his Exposition of
Matthew. 18. Let the Reader therefore observe how weak Erastus is, in arguing
against pregnant Scriptures, for Excommunication.

Erastus. You must prove, that to mourn, because the man is not taken Lib. 3.
c. 4. p. 213.
away, is all one, as to mourn that he is not debarred from the Sacraments by
the Ministers and Elders.

Ans. That is denied; to be debarred from the Sacraments, is but a consequent
of Excommunication: 2. It is a putting of the man from amongst them, not by
death, that we have refuted; not from eating and drinking with him only, that
I improved before: Ergo, it must be a Church ou^-casting.

Erastus. Paul might deliver the man to Satan, though he did Repent; Page 215.
as the Magistrate did punish Malefactors, whether they Repented or no^.

An. Ergo, he repen: ed, and was pardoned by the Corinthians, 2 Cor. 2. 10.
after he had been killed, which is absurd.

Erastus. If to deliver to Satan, were nothing but to debar the man from the
Sacraments, ever while he should repent; Why should Paul with a great deal of
pains and many words, have excused himself to the Corinthians, 2 Cor. 2. and
cap. 7. and as it were deprecate the offending of them; for they should know,
that this manner of coercing and punishing, was, and ought to be exercised in
the Church; if it was but a saving remedy and invitation to repentance, Why
were they sad? They should rather have rejoiced, as the Angels of Heaven does
at the Conversion of a sinner, then Paul must have intended another thing.

Ans. This is a mere conjecture as Erastus grants most he These. 58. p. 44. p.
225.
says against the place is; for he says, Aliam conjecturam etiam addidi, such
a violent remedy of repentance, as is the cutting off of a member from Christ's
body, being the most dreadful sentence of the King of the Church, nearest to
the last sentence, was to Paul, and ought to be a matter of sorrow to all the
Servants of God, as the foretelling of sad Judgments, moved Christ to tears,
Matthew. 23. 37* Luke 19. 41, 42. And moved Jeremiah to sorrow, cap. 9. 1. And
yet Christ was glad at the home-coming of sinners, Luke 15. 6, 7, etc. These
two are not contrary as Erastus dreameth, but subordinate; to wit, ( That
Christ should inflict the extremest vengeance of Excommunication, which also
being blessed of God, is a saving, though a violent remedy of repentance,) and
( To rejoice at the blessed fruit of Excommunication, which is the man's
repentance:) And the Apostle 2 Cor. 7. professes his sorrow, That he made them
sad, ver. 8. and also rejoices at their gracious disposition who were made
sorry: He is far from excusing himself, as if he had done any thing in
weakness; this were enough, and it is an Argument of our Protestant Divines,
to prove that the Books of the Macabees, are not Dited by the Holy Ghost, as
Canonick Scripture is; because the Author 2 Macab. 15. 38. excuses himself in
that History, as if he might have erred, which no Penman of holy Scripture can
do: And Erastus lays the like blame on Paul, as if he had repented that he
made them sorry, by chiding them, for not praying for a miraculous killing of a
Brother: This is enough to make the Epistles of Paul to be suspected as not
Canonick Scripture; yea, Paul says the contrary, 2 Cor. 7. 9. Now I rejoice,
not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance, for ye were
made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in
nothing, and 2 Cor. 2. 8, 9. he exhorts them to rejoicing, at the man's
Repentance, and to confirm their love to him, (which demonstrates that he was
now a living man, and not miraculously killed,) and commends their obedience,
v. 9. in sorrowing, as he did chide them that they sorrowed not, 1 Cor. 5. 2.
So that Paul is so far from accusing himself for making them sad, that by
the contrary, he commends himself for that, and rejoices thereat. And if the
matter had been Excommunication, while the man should repent, (says Erastus)
they knowing this ought to be in the Church, they should rather have rejoiced,
then bin sorry. And I answer, if the matter had been a miraculous killing of
him, that his Spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord: should they not
rejoice at his saving in the day of the Lord, whether this saving be wrought by
bodily killing, or by Excommunication? And so this conjecture may well be
retorted. 2. They were not to be sorry at the man's repentance, but to rejoice;
yet were they to be sorry at the violent mean of cutting him off from Christ's
body, as a father may be glad at the life and health of his child, and and yet
be sorry that by no other mean his health can be procured, but by cutting off a
finger, or a hand of his child. 3. They knew that miraculous killing (as
Erastus dreameth) was also a saving ordinance (the remaining in the Church, or
not remaining is all one) because Paul chideth them, (as he dreameth,) that the
man might be miraculously killed.

Erastus. What need was there that the Corinthians with such Page 45.
diligence should intercede for the man, if they knew when he repented, he was
to be received again into the Church? Now that they interceded for him is
clear, for Paul says, 2 Cor. 2. 10. To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive
also.

Ans. Because there is a great hazard in Excommunication, of an higher degree
of obduration and condemnation; if the party be not gained. 2. I see no ground
for this conjecture, that the Corinthians interceded for him at Paul's hand, for
if he ought to have been miraculously killed, then whether he repented or
repented not, both Paul and the interceders sinned; Paul in being broken, they
in requesting for a dispensation of a Law, in which God would not dispense, as
he that would request to spare the life of Number. 34. 31. 32.
a repenting Murderer against Gods express Law, should sin; and Paul should
sin in pardoning upon request, where God would not pardon.

Erastus. How excuses Paul himself that he would try their obedience, that c.
7. he would have their care for him made manifest, if he had not commanded a
greater thing, then to debar a wicked man from the Sacraments?

Ans. This is but a shadow of a reason against the Word of God, for to be cast
out of Christ's body, and not acknowledged for an Israelite of God, and that in
heaven and earth: and so to be debarred from the Seals, is a higher thing then
bodily killing, as to be received as a Member again, and to be written amongst
the living in Jerusalem, is like the rising from the dead, as may be gathered
from Romans 11. 15. and is far more then deliverance from miraculous killing.

Erastus. These words, ye was made sorry according to God, that 2 Cor. 7. 45.
ye might receive damage of us in nothing, cannot agree with the purpose, they
should have suffered no loss by obtaining pardon to a miserable man excluded
from the Sacraments, while he should repent; but if he was to be killed, they
should have lost a brother, and so suffered damage.

Ans. The hazard of losing his soul, repentance not being so easy, as Erastus
imagines, had been a greater loss, then the loss of a temporal life, the
soul being to be saved in the day of the Lord.

Erastus. Paul requires his Spirit, and the power of the Lord Jesus Page 45.
to this work; Ergo, It was more then to debar from the Sacraments.

Ans. Erastus should prove; Ergo, It was more then to Excommunicate. 2. Ergo,
It was rather more then bodily death. His seventh reason I hope after to
examine.

Erastus. Paul says, he decreed to do this, and does not command Page 45. 46.
the Church to do it, or that the Church alone should do it: We never read
that Paul, whether alive or dead, did write to one, or many, to deliver any to
Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, that was proper to the Apostles only,
as the gift of healing was, Act. 5. and c. 13. and he writes, he will come
himself with the rod, and he himself 1 Timothy 1. delivered Hymeneus and
Alexander to Satan.

Ans. This is much for us, you never read that Paul did write The Church, not
Paul alone had hand in delivering the man to Satan.
to one or many, and did chide them, because they prayed not that he might
work this and this particular miracle; or that without error he might write
this or that Canonick Scripture, and therefore because this delivering to
Satan, was commanded to the conveened together Church, with his Apostolic
spirit, and warrant to deliver such a one to Satan, and to judge him. v. 12.
And to purge him out, and cast him out, therefore am I persuaded it was no
miracle proper to Paul only. 2. How prove you that Paul, his alone without the
Church Excommunicated Hymeneus? Paul says that Timothy received the gift of
God, by his laying on him hands, 2 Timothy 1. 6. Ergo, By the laying on of his
hands only, and not of the whole Presbytery? It follows not, the contrary
is, 1 Timothy 4. 14. 3. Delivering to Satan, v. 5. is all one with purging out, v.
7. as is clear by the Illation. I have decreed, though absent, to deliver such
a one to Satan. Hence his consequence, v. 7. (...), Purge out therefore. 2. To
deliver to Satan, is either all one with judgeing those that are within, v. 12.
And so with judging this man, and with putting of him out, v. 13. or it is not
all one; if these be all one, then has the Church a hand in this delivering to
Satan, and so it is not a miraculous killing. Erastus grants the consequence,
if these be not all one, this is two judgings of the man, one of Paul's v. 5. by
miraculous killing, and another of Paul's and the Church, v. 12. This latter
must be some Church judgeing of those that are within the Church, common to
Paul and the Corinthians, as the words clear, and which is opposed to Gods
judging of those that are without; and this is so like Excommunication, that
Erastus must make some other thing of it. Now we cannot say that there was any
miraculous judging of this man, common to Paul as an Apostle, and to the
Corinthians, the ordinary believers and Saints, as Erastus yields. 3. (...)
to put (...), ^st intersiccre. p. 47.
away the man, which is expressly commanded to the Church of Corinth, v. 13.
must be the same (...) and putting away, (...), in the same word (...), that
is, v. 2. But that taking out of the midst of them is a miraculous killing of
the man, as Erastus says, now this cannot be, for then the people must be
joined in the same work of miraculous killing with the Apostle Paul; now both
we and Erastus must disclaim this; Ergo, there must be some common Church
casting out, common to both.

Erastus. To put away out of the midst of them, is not to debar from the
Sacraments, but to kill; if it were but to extrude the man out of the society
of the faithful, what need was there of public mourning? and if he had been
to be cast out amongst the heathen, how could the spirit be saved? as is said,
for without the Church there is no salvation.

Ans. To put away out of the midst of them, is to put the man out of the
Congregation, as the word Careh is expounded before, and is not to kill: were
Hymeneus and Alexander delivered to Satan, that they might learn not to
blaspheme? what learning or Discipline can dead men be capable of? 2. There Is
need of mourning when any is cut off from Christ's body, it being the highest
judgment of God on earth. 3. Without the visible Church altogether as Heathens
are, there is no salvation; But to be so without the Church, as the casting out
is a medicinal punishment, That the soul may be saved in the day of the Lord,
is a mean to bring the soul in, to both the invisible and visible Church, and
puts none in that state, that they cannot be saved, but by the contrary in a
way to be saved; so the man periret, nisi periret.

Erastus. It would seem, it may be proved from the Text, that the In These. 48.
man persevered not in that wickedness, for the Text says, (...) and (...):
He that has done, and that has wrought this deed, not he that does this deed;
and therefore it seems Paul would inflict punishment as a good Magistrate uses
to do (even though the man repent) and he says, that his spirit may be saved,
then the man repented.

Ans. 1. Reconcile these two ( Paul was as a good Magistrate to kill the man,
though he should repent) and ( yet at their intercession (says Erastus) he did
forgive him;) durst Paul at the request of men, pardon a Malefactor contrary to
the duty of a good Magistrate? 2. Can Paul intend, in miraculous killing, only
the saving of the man's soul, and knowing that he was saved, and having obtained
his end, yet he will use the mean, that is, he will kill him? or if he intended
another end also, that others might fear, how could he not kill for this end? A
good Magistrates zeal should not be softened and blunted, for the request of men.

Erastus he says, He decreed to deliver the man to Satan, for the destruction
of the flesh, that the soul may be saved; now (...) is to give over, to permit;
here a person given, a person to whom, a person giving, to wit, Paul, and the
end; wherefore, that the spirit may be saved; it is, as if I would give my son
to a Master, either to be instructed, or chastised, so 1 Timothy 1. Act. 27. 28.
Matthew. 5. 18. Matthew. 24. (...), Mar. 15. The brother shall deliver the brother
to death, and the Lord says to Satan, behold (...), I give him to thee, this
is to deliver one afflicted, killed, condemned.

Ans. All this is needless; to be delivered over, is to be recommended and
taken in a good sense also, Act. 14. 26. Commended to the grace of God, Act.
15. 40. (...) and we To be delivered to Satan.
deny not but to be delivered to Satan, is to be delivered to be afflicted, but
the question is, what affliction is meant here; the affliction of the flesh say
we, or of the unrenewed part, opposed to a saved spirit.

Erastus. It is unpossible that the word (...) destruction, can be Page 218.
The destruction of the flesh.
shown to signify the destruction of the desires of sinful flesh in all the
New Testament, it always signifies killing, death, destruction; nor does the
thing it self compel us to take it other ways here, nor for killing and
death, as 1 These. 5. It is true (...) Romans 8. (...) to kill, destroy, crucify,
are so taken, but never (...) or (...) in either sacred or profane Authors.

Ans. I conceive Chrysostom knew Greek better then Erastus, Chrysostom. Homil.
15. in 1 Cor.
the man was delivered to Satan, (...). That he might scourge him (as he did
Job) with a hurtful boil or some other sickness. Hence as that learned and
judicious Divine, who has deserved excellently of the Protestant Churches,
Pet. Molineus In suo vate opuscule eruditissimo. lib. 2. cap. 11. page 108.
Hyeronymus in cap. 5. ad Galat.
Petrus Molineus says on the place, Chrysostom, Homo Greece eloquentiae R^rum
exemplum, A rare example of Grecian eloquence, does think per (...) by the word
destruction, not death, but some heavy torment to be meant; And I am sure
Hieronymus, a man in the tongues incomparably skilled said, by destruction
here, was meant jejunia and egrotationes, fasting and diseases: 2. Nor need we
contend for (...), which in all Authors of the world, signifies destruction,
for (...) is to destroy; the question will rather be, what is meant by the
flesh, but certainly it is in profane Greek Authors as unusual (I except
sacred Greek Authors, such as Basil, Chrysostom, who knew what mortification
meant) to speak as Paul does, Romans 8. 13. If ye mortify the deeds of the
flesh, ye shall live: Let Erastus find me a parallel to that in the New
Testament, (...) I think Erastus may not deny that this is to mortify the
sinful works of the body of sin, yet Aristotle, Plato, Lucian, Plutarch,
H^siod, Homer, nor any profane Greek Author ever spoke so: We shall therefore
deny that (...) signifies never to Greek Authors any thing but bodily death:

destruction. 3. We say it is unpossible that (...) can be showen to signify in
either Old or New Testament, a miraculous destroying of the body by Satan, we
retort this reason back upon Erastus, his Exposition is not tolerable, because
it wants a parallel place, it is his own reason.

Erastus. The destruction of the flesh must be the destruction of the body, not
of concupiscence, because he adds that the spirit (...) may be saved, here
the soul is opposed to the body.

Ans. Though we should grant, that by the flesh is meant the body, yet it
follows not, it is the miraculous killing of the man, as I observed before.
2. It makes nothing against Excommunication; for many learned Protestants
teach, that though to deliver to Satan were a bodily punishment or conjoined
therewith, as the Learned Anto. Waleus does observe; yet the Apostle is clear
for Excommunication in this chapter; and the learned Molineus denies
delivering to Satan to be expounded of Excommunication, and will have the
destruction of the flesh to be some bodily tormenting of his body by Satan, and
so does sundry of the Fathers, especially Ambrose, Hyeronimus, Augustinus, and
Chrysostom; though Augustine be doubtful: Yet Molineus says, Certum est paulum
velle hunc incestum moveri communione Ecclesia: sed id vult fieri ab ipsa
Ecclesia Cor^nthiaca, dicens, ver. 13. Tollite istum sceleratum e medio
vestrum: And that grave and judicious Divine Piscator says, on the place; That
the form of Excommunication is this delivering to Satan: but the destruction
of the flesh, he thinks to be the exhausting of the natural strength of the
body with sorrow for his sin, according to that Prove. 17. 22. A broken heart
dries the bones: And therefore it is to be observed that ^rastily, Erastus
insisteth most on those points and syllables of a Text, whereon all Divines,
Ancient and Modern do place least strength for Excommunication; I might
therefore pass all Erastus his force against Excommunication in these, and he
shall be not a whit nearer his point. 2. But I shall follow him; when (...) the
flesh, and (...) the spirit are put together, I see no reason that the one
should signify the body, the other the soul: I know the contrary to be, Romans
8. 1. Those that walks (...) after the inordinate affections, and lusts of
the flesh, are opposed to those that walk, (...) after the spirit, and Gal. 5.
17. the flesh, ((...)) lusts against the spirit, and the spirit ((...))
against the flesh, Joh. 3. 6. That which is born of the flesh, (...) is flesh,
it is not that which is born of the body as body, and that which is born (...)
of the spirit is spirit, so Romans 8. 9. 13, 14. Erastus should have showed us
such places wherein (...) and (...) the flesh and the spirit signifies the
body and the soul, when the matter of salvation is spoken of as here, That the
spirit may be saved, ver. 5. then (...) the flesh is for the most part, if not
always, taken in an evil part, for the corruption of man's nature.

Erastus. How could they desire the Apostle not to deliver him to Satan, that
he might ( as Beza expounds it) destroy his flesh, that is, bring him to
repentance? How could Paul assent to such a Petition? How could the Apostle
write that he did forgive him? Did Paul by forgiving him, permit him not to
mortify and destroy his flesh, and sinful lusts?

Ans. Let Erastus answer, How could the Corinthians beseech Paul not to kill
him, that his soul may be saved in the day of the Lord? How could Paul grant
such a Petition, as that the man should not be saved in the day of the Lord?
How could Paul by pardoning the man, permit, that he should not be saved in the
day of the Lord? for the saving of the man's soul, is no less a fruit of this
delivering to Satan, then is the destroying of the lusts of the flesh. 2. They
might well desire that upon the man's repentance Paul would take a milder way
and course to effectuate these two desirable ends, the mortification of his
lust, and the saving of his soul, then the last and most dreadful remedy,
which is the censure of Excommunication. 3. The destruction of the lusts of the
flesh is a Scripturall remedy for saving of the soul in the day of Christ, at
is clear, Romans 7. 7, 8, 9, 10. Gal. 5. 24, 25. But whether miraculous killing
be such a mean ordained of God is the question, and ought to be proved by some
word of God, beside this place in controversy.

Erastus. These words, that the soul may be saved in the day of These. 59. page
49.
the Lord, do hold forth, that the miserable man was presently to die.

Ans. That they hold forth no such thing, is evidently proved, for how were
they to cast him out and judge him? And how was Paul to pardon him, and they
and Paul to confirm their love? 2. When Peter says, 1 Pet. 1. 7. That your
faith may be found unto praise, honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus
Christ? were all these presently? Because Paul and the faithful Philippians
were waiting for their Saviors second coming, who should change their vilde
bodies, were they to die presently? When Paul prays, that Onesiphorus may
find mercy in that day, 2 Timothy 1. 18. I pray you, will it follow that
Onesiphorus was presently to die?

Erastus. The word (...) rebuke, does not signify rejecting from the
Sacraments, 1. Rejecting from the Sacraments is never put for punishment These.
59. 49.
in Scripture. 2. It is but a rebuke inflicted by many; and Paul, 2 Cor. 2.
absolveth him from this as a sufficient punishment, a rebuke is no punishment.

Ans. 1. To be debarred from the society of the faithful, as Hagar was, as
Cain was; as David was, Cast out of the Lords inheritance by Saul; yea, to be
rebuked, Ezech. 3. 25, 26. are evils, but they are not evils of sin; Ergo, He
speaks not like a Divine, who will not have them punishments; if to enjoy the
Sanctuary, Church, holy things of God, and the society of the Saints be a rich,
blessing of God, as the Scripture says it is, Psalm. 42. 4. Psalm. 27. 4. Psalm.
84. 10. Psalm, 110. 3. Psalm. 63. 1, 2, 3. Cant. 1. 7. 8. Cant. 2. 16. 17. Cant.
5. 1. Cant. 6. 1, 2, 3. Rev. 2, 1. and to deny this be a symtome of prophanity,
then to be separated from these as a Heathen, must be to the children of God,
the greatest evil of punishment and matter of sorrow on earth, it smells not
of piety to deny this.

Erastus. If the man was only rebuked; How was he to be delivered These. 60.
Page 50.
to Satan to be tormented and killed? Some Ancients answer, he was but
delivered to Satan to be afflicted in his body with sickness, and at length
delivered by Paul, others say more congruously to the mind of Paul; that Paul
purposed not by himself to deliver the man to Satan, but to do it, with the
Church congregated together, and when the Church saw him swallowed up with
grief, they deferred while they tried Paul's mind, and obtained pardon to him,
and in the means time threatened him, if he should not repent; and obtained at
length, that Paul should pardon him. Ans. Many learned Divines hold the former,
yet so as they conclude Excommunication out of this Chapter; of this I say no
more. But Erastus has a way of his own. To which I say, 1. There is no
Scripture, but this controverted one to warrant that the Apostles who had the
gift of Miracles, 1. Suspended the working of Miracles, either on the prayers,
or free consent of the whole multitude of believers. 2. That the execution of a
miraculous work, was committed to Deputies and substitutes under Paul, who had
it in their power miraculously to kill him, or in their free will and Christian
compassion, to suspend the miracle, and not kill. 3. That the Apostles in acts
of miraculous justice, sought advise of any, or might be broken by requests, to
desist from miracles as they saw the party repent, or not repent, or friends
intercede, or not intercede. 4. So many circumstances of the Text, laying a
command on the Church of Corinth, to put him out and judge him, and yet the
matter remain a miracle. These to me are riddles, if God had told us such a
History, I could have believed it; but to gather these by uncertain
conjectures. without any ground of other Scriptures, is a thing I can hardly
believe. But since Excommunication is an ordinary censure, the Church might
well, as they see the man penitent, or contumacious, cast him out, or not,
pardon, or not pardon.

Erastus. Paul delivered to Satan Hymeneus and Alexander, that they might
learn not to blaspheme, not that the dead are capable to learn, or to be
blasphemed; but this be says as a Magistrate, when he says he will give an
ill doer to the hangman, that he may learn to steal no more, and to rob no
more.

Ans. 1 Timothy 1. 20. I delivered them to Satan. (...). Page 221. Hymeneus and
Alexander not killed by Satan.
It is like to edifying discipline, and agreeable to Paul's use of the rod of
discipline, 2 Cor. 10. 8. Though I should boast somewhat more of our
authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for
destruction. Now it were safer to give a sense congruous to the intrinsecall
end of discipline, which was not for destruction of the body, but for the
edifying of souls. 2. Yea, so Paul had no less the Sword, then the rod of the
Word, Nero had not so heavy a sword, as miraculous killing: Should not Paul
speak rather as a Pastor of Christ, then as a bloody Magistrate?

Erastus. If to deliver to Satan, be all one with debarring from Page 223.
the Supper only, yet it is not all one, with being cast out of the Church,
without which there is no salvation, but the Supper is not absolutely necessary
to Salvation.

Ans. Nor do we put that necessity on the Sacraments, but where the man is
excluded from the Sacraments, for such a sin as if he repent not, he is
excluded from Salvation; it concerns him much to think it a weighty
judgment to be excluded from the Seals.

Erastus. These two are inconsistent which you teach, to wit, that Page 223.
he is not debarred from the Sacraments, who desires them, and that his desire
whether it be a right, or a wrong and unlawful desire, shall depend on the
judgment of others, to wit, the Presbytery.

Ans. Erastus should have made others see how these two fights together, I see
no inconsistencie, no more then to say a child that desires food is not
debarred from food, and yet his desire of food may be subject to wise Stewards,
whether every desire of food be right or no, as whether he should be answered
by the Stewards, when he desires poison or bread, not to ea^e, but to cast to
dogs; and this will fight against preaching of the Word, the Professor that
longs for the comforts of the promises of the Gospel is not debarred from
them, yet are preachers to try whether threatenings be not fitter for him in his
security, then the comforts of the promises.

Erastus. Paul, 2 Cor. 12. and 13. threatens not exclusion from Page 224.
the Lords Supper, to those who had not repented of their schism,
drunkenness, denying of the resurrection, but he says he would severely
punish them according to the authority and power given him of God, and he did
this frequently, but we read not exclusion from the sacraments.

Answ. 1. It is true, he threatens those who had not repented of their
uncleanness, and fornication, and lascivionsnesse, 2. Cor. 12. 20, 21. and c.
13. v. 2. threatens that he will not spare, but use his authority, but does
Erastus read that he either threatens, or does actually, miraculously kill any
of the believers at Corinth? and let him answer why the Apostle did not write
to the Church* that they would conveene, and take course with them, as he did
with the incestuous man, 1 Cor. 5. 2. when he says, He will not spare when he
comes, he must be expounded according to Erastus, to come as a miraculous
Magistrate to kill them. 3. He says not they were impenitent, but he fears
it should be so. 4. We hold if any should be contumacious, he would not only
deny pearls to such Swine, as his Master commanded, Mat. 7. But also follow
that rule, Mat. 18. 4. Erastus himself grants, if there shall be found a man
that tramples upon the Pearls and holy things of God, as there must be some
one or other, which is such as deserves to be miraculously killed: By this
Argument he grants (I say) that such a one should not be admitted. Hunc ego
minime admittendum censeo, but how shall he be not admitted by this Argument?
Page 207. Page 223. 124.


Erastus. There were many amongst the Ancients who deferred their Baptism to
the end of their life, when therefore it is not written, that these are damned,
who are excluded from the Supper, against their will, and not those who
willingly exclude themselves from Baptism, why should the one more then the
other be delivered to Satan? for he is in a better condition, who is excluded
by the Presbyters against his will from the Supper, then he who does of his
own free will exclude him self from Baptism.

Ans. That the Ancients in the Apostolic Church, which is our rule, did
defer baptism till they died, Erastus cannot prove, the Ancients after them
is not our rule. 2. That these were admitted to the Supper, a Sacrament of the
nourishment of these in whom Christ lives, before they were baptized, which is
the Sacrament of Regeneration, and our first birth, cannot be defended by
Erastus, and so he argues from an unlawful practice. 3. We reach not that any
is damned, because he is excluded from the Supper, that Exclusion is a
punishment; men are damned for sins, not for mere punishments, but his sin is
bound in heaven, because of a great scandal; such as incest, and that, if he
repent not, is the cause of damnation: and therefore Erastus should have
compared sin with sin, the scandal with sinful refusing of Baptism, and
not have made a halting and lame comparilon, an argument that concludes
nothing. 4. Though those who deferred baptism till death, should not have been
delivered to Satan, yet will Erastus say, they should not have been otherwise
censured? for these behooved with Socinians to hold Baptism but an indifferent
rite, and by this many lived in the contempt of a necessary ordinance, (though
not simply necessary) and so died with the sinful want of Baptism many times.

Erastus.The exclusion of men from the Sacraments did creep into the Church
when men did ascribe salvation to the Sacraments, therefore the Supper was
given to dying men, though excommunicate; as the denial of the Supper damneth,
Ergo, the receiving of it saves. And so of Baptism they reasoned.

Answ. Erastus names this his own probable conjecture. But it is to beg the
question, he may know how singular Augustine was for the necessity of Baptism,
and how many of the Ancients were against him in it. 2. He may know this
consequence to be a conjecture, and that it is not stronger, because it is his
own. 3. He grants that exclusion of the unworthy from the Sacraments is
ancient, so much gain we by his conjectures.

Erastus. When the Church wanted a Magistrate and the sword* Page 227. 228. 229.
Paul commanded that the Corinthians might obtain by their prayers, that the
incestuous man might be put from amongst them, that is, that he might be
killed; if he command not that the man be killed, but cast out of the Church
only, he should say as much as if one should bid preserve the chastity of a
Virgin by casting her out of the society of chaste matrons, into a
bordell-house; and Paul bids not the Corinthians deliver the man to Satan;
but only that they would convene, that he might, as present* in Spirit, deliver
him to Satan; and that they would deliver him to Satan, and put him out of
the midst of them, by prayers and mourning: for in my corrected Thesis, I said,
that this, put away evil out of the midst of you, Deuteronomy. 13. was in sillabs
Deuteronomy. 17. and 19 and 21. 22. ^er. etc. 24. once, and (...) is in them all.

Answ. 1. That the Church wanted the sword is no wonder; the Church as the
Church, has no such carnal weapons as the Sword, and that Peter in killing
Ananias and Saphira, and Paul in striking Elymas with blindness, did supply
the place of a Christian Magistrate which the Church then wanted, so as it was
the Christian Magistrate his place, if there had been any to strike Ananias and
Saphyra with sudden death* I do not believe upon Erastus his word, because I
find Nadab and Abihu killed immediately by the Lord from heaven with fire,
Lev. 10. 1. and at that time when there was Moses and ordinary Magistrates to
have killed them, and God immediately caused the earth to open her mouth and
swallow up quick Cor^h and his company, and yet there was a Magistrate to do
justice on them, for their ^reasonable conspiracy; and I see not how this may
not warrant Ministers, when either heathen or Tyrannous Magistrates refuse to
use the sword, to fall to as Pastors, and in an extraordinary manner use the
sword against murderers in the visible Church. It is true, Peter's miraculous
killing of Ananias, may possibly hold forth the duty analogically Delivering to
Satan not miraculous.
of punishing ill doers in a Magistrate, where he is a Christian member of the
Church. But it is a conjecture without Scripture, that here Paul does call the
Corinthians in to come and be coactors with him by their prayers in a
particular miracle which was never wrought, for Erastus grants he was never
killed. 1. Paul reprehendeth their not mourning, v. 2. And you are puffed up,
and have not rather (...) mourned. This was an ordinary, Christian, not a
miraculous duty, which they should have performed as a Church, though he should
not have written to them. Let Erastus clear how Paul chideth them, for want of
an habitual Faith of Miracles, and of a sorrow proportioned thereunto. 2. That
Gal. 5. 12. (...) would God they were cut off that trouble you; if this was in
Paul's power, by a miracle to cut off the false Apostles, how could Paul wish to
do a Miracle and did it not? 2. If he wished these should be cut off by the
Galathians, then as Beza de Presbyt. page 82. says, It was in the Galathians
power so to do; and why should not they have prayed miraculously for the
destruction of such? 3. In all the word, to deliver to Satan, is never to kill
by Satan; as Beza says, and Erastus can answer nothing to it. 4. That Paul
here took the Magistrates Sword, because the Magistrate was a Heathen. 5. That
the Church, when a Magistrate does not his duty, is to pray, that God would by
some miraculous and immediate providence, supply the Magistrates place. 6. That
Paul does rebuke the Corinthians, not for the omission of an ordinary duty, and
the want of an ordinary faith, but because of the want of extraordinary sorrow,
and of the faith of Miracles, in old and young, and women who could pray for
the miraculous killing of this man, all these look beside the Text, for ver. 2.
he says such a heinous sin is committed, and ye are puffed up, (...) blown
up, and have not rather (...) mourned: this is the defect of an ordinary grace,
and hardness and security that Paul rebukes in them, as the first word
signifies, 1 Cor. 8. 1. (...) (...) knowledge puffs up, 1 Cor. 13. 4. Love
(...) is not blown up, 1 Cor. 4. 6. 1 Cor. 4. 18. Col. 2. 18. and the other
word signifies ordinary sorrow, Mat. 5. 4 Blessed are they that mourn, (...),
Luke 6. 25. 2 Cor. 12. 21. Iam. 4. 9. Mat. 9. 15. There is not one word of
praying by the faith of miracles in the Text (for such a faith is required to
such a prayer) that God would miraculously destroy the man, or that Paul
rebuked them for not praying in this miraculous faith: it is the way of Erastus
to obtrude Expositions on the Scripture, so unknown and violent, as they are
darker and harder to be believed then the Text. 5. The Apostle commands them
to (...), to put away not always to kill.
put out the man (...), that is, to kill him: What killing is this? to pray to
God that Paul miraculously may put him out, and kill him, give us any word of
God, that (...) in the Old or New Testament signifies any such thing, there is
not one word of Prayer in the Text: 6. They were to conveen, not simply, as
Christians, to pray, but with the virtue of his spirit, as present in mind,
but absent in body; this must put some more in them then a mourning spirit, for
the want of which he rebuked them; it is as much as he and they together were
to join in putting out the man and judging him, as he speaks, ver. 12. 7. Nor
is this all one, as to put a woman out of the company of chaste Matrons to the
bordel house to keep her chastity, no more then the wisdom of God in Paul does,
Romans 16. 17. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 14. 15. put unordinate walkers out of the society of
those who walk according to the truth of the Gospel, that they may preserve
their sound walking, especially when exclusion from the godly causes shame,
and so humiliation, and this reason is against Gods wisdom, as much as against
us: 8. That to put away evil, (...), Deuteronomy. 17. and 19. and 21. and 22. is to
kill, is not denied, and that in diverse places, but not to pray that evil may
be miraculously put away, as Erastus says: But we are to see, whether (...) in
the Hebrew (of which Language Erastus professes his ignorance) signify that
always: The contrary I have already shown, the learned Pagnine and Mercer say
the contrary, that it signifies, to cur, devide, or strike a Covenant, Genesis

Critica Sacra Leigh in Critica Sacra, page 245.
on the Old Testament, says, it signifies to stay, to cut off by death, by
banishment, or any other way, whereby a thing in use before, afterward cease,
Joel. 1. 8. Amos 1. 5. Yea, to cut off by divorce, as I noted before, and Exodus
12. 15. To cut off from Israel, is expounded, ver. 19. to cut off from the
Church of Israel: Yea, the Law forbids that not only in the time of the
Passover, they should not eat leaven, but it should not be in their houses;
Now must they be killed, if it was found in their houses, beside their
knowledge? see Deuteronomy. 16. 3. Exodus 13. 7. What Erastus says to the end of the
Chapter; is but repeated reasons before answered.

CHAP. X.
Quest. 6.
Arguments for Excommunication, from 1 Corinthians 5. vindicated.

REverend Beza said, The world is the Kingdom of Satan, and he that is
delivered to Satan, is cast out of Christ's Kingdom to Satan's Kingdom.

Erastus says, Is it not easier to heal them by remaining in the Lib. 3. cap.
5. p. 233.
Church, having the Magistrate to compel them to their duty, then to cast them
out of the Church? The world is a kingdom of wickedness and impiety, may you
not more easily reform a wanton and lascivious virgin within the house, then
by casting her out of the house into a Bordel? Will not slaves of Satan be more
easily healed amongst the children of God, then amongst wicked men?

Ans. Whether, to be delivered to Satan, be to be put formally in his power,
that he may vex the spirit, that the man may be humbled for sin, or if it be to
be given to Satan only, consequenter, and cast out of the Church, that is,
Christ's office-house of Grace, to live as the world, of which Satan is God and
Prince, 2 Cor. 4. 4. Joh. 12. 31. Ioh. 14. 30. It is not much to be disputed:
But this reason is against the wisdom of God, who has appointed that the
shame, grief and sorrow of being put out of Christ's family, should To eschew
the scandalous a mean to save them.
exceedingly humble the spirit of any in whom there is any thing of God.

And Erastus might as well say to Paul, why do thou command the Saints not to
eat and drink with those that are called brethren, and yet are fornicators,
covetous, extortioners, 1 Cor. 4. 11. and such as cause divisions and walk
inordinately, as Romans 16. 17. 2 These. 3. 14, 15. and to withdraw from their
company? they must then converse only with the slaves of Satan, and the wicked
of the world, when they are deprived of the society of the godly, and that is
the way to loose them; were it not better to command the just contrary, that
the godly should eat, drink and converse with inordinate walkers? for they may
turn them from their evil way; for will an unchaste virgin be made chaste by
being cast out of her fathers house into a Bordel-house? Will not slaves of
Satan rather be healed amongst the children of God, then amongst the wicked?

But Erastus sees not, that Gods aim in this separation, is not only, that
the cast out man may be ashamed, 2 These. 3. 14, 15. and so humbled and brought
to repentance, when he finds he is deprived of the blessings of the Saints,
of their society, Ordinances: But also God has a higher aim, to the end, the
whole lump of Christ's body, be not leavened and infected with the contagion of
one man, 1 Cor. 4. 6, 7. Gal. 5. 9. 10.

Erastus. The similitude of a rotten Member, proves nothing: Lib. 3. c. 5.
page 234.
for 1. There be no such sinners desperately uncurable, of whom there is no
hope so long as they live, except pertinacious Heretics erring in the
foundation of salvation, and such as sin against the holy Ghost: 2. It is not
necessary that men using reason and free will, be defiled and corrupted by
other sinners, as the whole Member is by the rotten Member; for as a Tree
cannot but be burnt by the fire that seaseth on it, so neither can the Members
continuated by touching, escape corruption. 3. None can be cast out of the
Church into The simi litude of a cut off member to hold forth Excommucation
vindicated.
the world, as it is the kingdom of Satan, for if they keep the faith, though
they were amongst Turks, they are not in the world, that is, in the Kingdom of
Satan, nor in the world: 4. Paul would not have him cast out into the world,
that his soul may be saved, for this were to make the weak despair, and make
them hypocrites.

Ans. This similitude is the holy Ghosts in the very sense we use it, 2 Timothy 2.
17. Their word shall eat as a canker, a Metaphor (as Calvin, Piscator,
Marlorate observe) from a rotten member that corrupts the whole body, and to
say, because a man has reason and so free will, that he will not be corrupted;
whereas the whole member by necessity of nature cannot but be corrupted by a
rotten member, is to speak not like a Divine, but as Pelagius speaks; for
except we use the remedy appointed of God, to eschew the contagion of the
wicked, and eschew their company, as we are commanded, and as the godly have
done, and the wicked have not done, and therefore have been infected with the
way of other evil men, Prove. 22. 24. Prove. 5* 8, 9. Psa. 26. 4, 5. Esa. 2. 6,
7. Psa. 119. 63. Psa. 139. 21, 22. Rev. 18. 4. 2 Chro. 19. 2. (though we should
not actually be corrupted) yet we sin and tempt the Lord, in that we seek a
temptation to our selves; yea, as all the reasons of Erastus are natural and
against the wisdom of God in his Ordinances, so expressly this; God forbids
his people to marry with the Canaanites, or to make Covenants with them, Exodus
34. 12, etc. Because (says the Lord) they will ensnare thee, and draw away thy
heart after their Gods: May not Erastus say, But men have reason and free will
not to consent to the enticing counsels of the Canaanites, though they be
joined in Covenant, and marriage with them: Preterea non est necesse sic alios
a malis contaminari. 3. It is good, that Erastus grants, that pertinacious
Heretics, because uncurable, may infect others, for so the word expressly
says, what shall be done with them? Erastus grants they be rotten members:
Ergo, either they must, by Excommunication be separated from the body, as we
teach, or the body must separate from them; if this latter be said, all that
Erastus infers against us, shall fall against himself: 1. We shall not need
to be infected with the Heresy of such: Vtimur ratione, We have the Armor of
reason and freewill, against this rotten and rotting member, says Erastus: 2.
We shall expose Heretics to the Kingdom of Satan, and the world, by which they
shall be hardened in their pernicious Heresies: Beside 3. We make them
Hypocrites: 4. I see no warrant Erastus has to say, That Heretics erring in
fundamentals are more contagious and rotten members then slaves of Satan,
failing against the second Table: 5. He that is cast out of the Church, though
amongst the Turks, is in the world, but not of the world: If he keep the
faith, and if he do so, he shall repent and come home to Christ's visible
Kingdom, but because he keeps the faith, yet he is not a member of a visible
Church, except he profess it, and repent; for even the sound in faith, if
obstinate in Scandals, may deserve Excommunication. 6. There is nothing said
against Excommunication in the two last Reasons, but what strikes against
Timothy his public rebuking, and threatening wrath against those that sin
openly, for they may through their own corruption, so far abuse public
threatenings, as they may be led on despair and hypocrisy. Now Erastus as we
shall hear, grants those are to be rebuked openly, who sin openly. 7. We say
not to deliver to Satan any man, is to deliver him to the World, but to cast
him out of the Church, that consequenter he may be left to the World; but that
he should sin, and be led away with the World, is neither the intrinsecall
end of Excommunication, or of the Church, but an event or end by accident* the
intrinsecall end is the Salvation of the man.

Beza says, that Paul speaks of a spiritual punishment, and not of a
corporal.

Erastus says. When Peter killed Ananias corporally, was not this Page 235.
corporal punishment? When Paul gave some to Satan for the destruction of the
flesh, and God punishes our sins with temporal death, how shall you prove
that God, and the Apostles punishes not sins with corporal, or politic
punishment?

Ans. The instance of Peter's killing Ananias is in vain brought No warrant that
the Apostles killed any by the ministry of Satan.
in* Its but a begging os the question, for it is not said Peter delivered
Ananias to Satan, that his Spirit might be saved. Who revealed this secret to
Erastus, that Peter used the Ministry of Satan in killing Ananias? We have as
good reason to say, Peter delivered Ananias to a good Angel to be killed, as
Erastus has for his dream. 2. We deny not, but God and the Apostles did
punish sin with corporal punishment, but let him show without the bounds of
the place in controversy; (for we must expound Scripture by Scripture) where
ever the Church conveened together in the Name of the Lord Jesus, did judge and
miraculously kill any member of the Church, that the Spirit may be saved in the
day of God.

Beza said, This killing by the people, would be ground of a great Calumny, to
make many say, Christians did usurp the Sword of the Magistrate, and that they
were not subject to the Magistrate.

Erastus. We give this power of miraculous killing only to the Apostles.

Ans. Yea, But the calumny stands so long as Erastus gives to all the people
the faith of Miracles to conveene and pray that Paul might miraculously kill
those that offended the Church, and its probable when the enemies objected to
Christians, all they could falsely, they would not have omitted this, that the
very people by their prayers meet in one Church-jury, to kill Cesars Subjects.
Beza said, The Christian Magistrate should by this kill all the drunkards,
fornicators, and the like with the Sword.

Erastus answers, 1. All faults deserve not killing, but some Page 236. 237.
other punishment of a lower degree. 2. The Lord himself appointed that the
Magistrate should compel men to do their duty, why then should Beza speak
against God, and call this a compelling of men to be Hipocrites?

Ans. If other sins, as drunkenness, fornication, extortion, do No miraculous
faith required in the Corinthians for the killing of the man.
infect the Church, and be scandalous to the very Gentiles, as the Apostle
says of incest, 1 Cor. 5. 1. 6, 7. Upon the same reason Paul should have
rebuked them, because they did not from the faith of Miracles pray that Paul
might inflict some miraculous judgment by the Ministry of Satan, though less
then death for other sins. But I pray you, Paul had either a warrant from God
to kill this man, or he had none at all: If he had a warrant, why did he not
that which is the part of a miraculous Magistrate without the prayers of the
Corinthians? Did Paul chide them, because they prayed not to God that he might
do his duty? if he had no warrant at all, Why should he chide the Corinthians,
for that they prayed not that he might do a duty, which was not his duty? For
that is not Paul's duty, for the doing whereof he has no warrant from God; if
it was his duty only conditionally; 1. What warrant is there in Scripture, to
say, Paul should have miraculously killed the incestuous person, upon condition
that the Corinthians had by the faith of Miracles, prayed that he might work
that miraculous slaughter, which because they did not, Paul was either exonered
of that as no duty, or then Paul chided them, because they prayed not to
prevene Paul's sinful neglect? 2. How was this revealed to the Corinthians,
that they should pray that God by Paul, as by his Magistrate might revenge this
incest, and not revenge their fronication, coveteousnes, extortion, Idolatry,
especially seeing he says that, v. 9. He had written to them in another
Epistle, not to ke^p company with such? Whence I think it evident, that Paul
in another Epistle, had ordained separation of Fornicators, Coveteous persons,
and the like, from amongst them, and so censures for all scandalous persons:
And how shall we believe he would not teach them to cast out incestuous persons,
that are far more scandalous? And if so, he must have written in another
Epistle of this miracle, that they were to pray he might work: Is it not
evident by this, that Erastus his way, is full of Conjectures and groundless
uncertainties. 2. We deny not that the Magistrate may compel men to do their
duty; nor does Beza deny that: But that the Church has or had any influence in
the blood of an incestuous person, and in working of miracles for the bodily
destruction of any, is most false, and cannot be proved by this Text: Nor do we
think that the Church (the weapons of whose warfare are carnal) can compel
any man by corporal punishment, to duties by the Sword; for so their
Spiritual way, which is terminated on the Conscience, should lead men to
Hypocrisy in profession of the truth, for so reasons Erastus; the Magistrate
with the Sword rather punishes sins committed in Gods Service, then forces to
duties: The fifth Argument of Beza is vindicated already.

Erastus. We say not that Paul was to deliver the man to Satan, that Page 237,
238.
he may be saved, but that Paul was to punish this high transgression with the
Sword, to the terror of others; but only he set bounds to Satan, that he should
only kill his body, but not meddle with his soul; but because the man repented,
Paul hoped well of his soul, that his soul should be saved in the day of Christ.

Ans. 1. Here Erastus does more fully reveal the vileness of his opinion, for
he grants the intrinsecall end of this miraculous killing, is not the
Salvation of the man's soul, but the revenging of the wickedness of the sin,
for the terror of others: Which is 1. Contrary to the Text, which says, He was
to be delivered to Satan* (...), that the spirit may be saved. This notes that
the intrinsecall end of this delivering to Satan, was the Salvation of the man's
soul: But the Text says nothing of Erastus his end, that others may be
terrified, though that may be an end. It is a wonder to me, that since Erastus
grants the man repented, even when Paul did in this Chapter chide with the
Corinthians, that they delivered him not to Satan: For Erastus says, (...), He
that has done this deed, not he that continues pertinaciously in it (says
he:) hence it is clear, that he repented at this time: How does Paul chide them
for not delivering a repenting man to the Devil? that his Spirit may be saved;
if he repented, his spirit was saved; Ergo, Paul was in the fault, and chid
them without reason; if they say, though he did repent, yet for example to
terrify others he should have been killed, 2 Cor. 2. says, He was not killed;
and Erastus says it; Ergo, yet Paul failed, and they also. 3. It is against
the intrinsecall end of that power which Erastus says is miraculous: For Paul
says the end of that power is for Edification, not for Destruction, 2 Cor. 10.
8. Now the intrinsecall end of bodily killing, is peace, and terror to others,
that they may be afraid to do so any more* But the intrinsecall end, and finis
operis, is not Edification, but finis operantis only, for acts of Magistrates
are not acts of the first Table which kindly, and per se, regards
edification, but acts of the second Table, if their souls be saved who die,
for their enormous crimes by the hand of the Magistrate: It is not from the
violent death, as if it were an intrinsecall mean and ordinance appointed of
God for conversion: But because God gives to those who die that way,
repentance. Yea, it is no more a mean of saving of the soul, then if they
should die in their beds by some disease.

To the examples of Hymeneus and Alexander, that they were not killed
miraculously, I answered before. Erastus adds no new reply to Beza.

Quest. 7.
Of the leaven, 1 Cor. 5. Erastus his sentence in his l. 3. c. 6. and Page 240.
241.
^. c. 7. Examined.

Erastus. I shall grant (since Beza will have it so) that Paul Of the leaven. 1
Cor. 5.
expounds the Ceremony of leaven, in the celebration of the passover, and
that he does not only allude to it: Paul compares the feast of unleavened
bread to the pilgrimage of our life in this world, and leaven signifies
wickedness: Hence as the Jews all the time of the feast might eat no leavened
bread, so all our life are we to leave and forsake the world and journey
toward our promised Canaan, we are never to live wickedly, What can hence be
collected? but as he that eat unleavened bread, was to be killed, so should
every wicked man be killed? He that eat leavened bread in these seven days,
was not commanded to be debarred from the Passover: And the Passover was the
beginning of this feast, as faith in Christ was the beginning of our spiritual
eating of Christ crucified for us, and of our new Christian life.

Ans. I hold that learned Beza has well expounded the leaven Beza contr.
Erastum de Presbytery, Page 88.
here; he compares the scandals of wicked men to leaven, the holiness of the
Saints to unleavened bread, and the public Congregation to the feast of the
Passover, and Excommunication or putting away to the removing of the leaven;
for a scandalous man corrupts Buxtorfius in Lexico, Rabinco. page 2303 in voc.
the whole Church: so the Jews and Rabbines, as Buxtorfius says, that the
Rabbis call natural concupiscence, (...). Rabbi Alexander said after his
Prayer: Lord, It is known to thee that it is my will to do thy will: But what
retardeth me? the leaven in the mass or lump, and Buxtorfius cites the same
place, 1 Cor. 5. (...)
6. and Gal. 5. 9. And least we should think that he meant nothing (...)
but natural concupiscense; he says in the Targum, They take the word (...)

Persian that he taught, had returned to folly, or his old wickedness. Paul
says the same, Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump:
He speaks to the Church conveened. 2. The comparison runs so, that the
Corinthians were to purge out the old leaven of wickedness, and cast out the
incestuous man, that they might be a new lump; and this if it must always be
done, far more when they are to celebrate that feast that came in place of the
passover: Nor is the Apostle only Teaching what they could not lawfully do,
all their life, as they were single Christians, but what was their duty as
Christians, (...) conveened together in a Church way, for Paul does not command
one single Christian to cast him out, but he commands the Church, gathered
together in the name of the Lord Jesus, with Paul's spirit, and the power of
What it is to purge out the leaven.
our Lord Jesus Christ, ver. 4. 5. To purge out, not the leaven of sin in
themselves, but the man, ver. 2. That he that has done this deed may be put
out, and ver. 7. Purge out the old leaven, and that the Apostles precept is to
cast out the man, he says it in express terms, ver. 13. (...), Cast out that
wicked man from amongst you, and ver. 12. They were to judge him, as one that
is within: 2. Because without conveening together in their daily conversation,
they were to purge the leaven of m^lice out of their heart, it were a
ridiculous thing for Paul to command them to convene altogether, to lead a
godly life: 3. There was no need that they should convene with Paul's spirit,
and in the name and power of our Lord Jesus Christ to lead a godly life, and
for a personal purging of every man his own soul from this leaven. 4. They
were to judge this man, ver. 12. Therefore this cannot be meant of a personal
judging every one of themselves, but of a Churchjudging of an offender. 5. If
Erastus grant that Paul expounds the Ceremony of leaven, and putting away
leaven in the Passover: Let him see how he can apply this to killing of every
single man that lives wickedly: We apply it to the casting out of the
scandalous out of the Church, as leaven was to be put out of the houses of all
who were to eat the passover.

Erastus. I care not much whither the Lord himself immediately, or None killed
for eating leavened bread.
the Magistrate was to kill him, who eat leavened bread at that time: But I
rather think that God killed him; for we find none killed for this cause: 2.
Because Paul writ of those who did unworthily eat, 1 Cor. 11.

Ans. There is no ground that God any way would have them to be killed, that
did eat unleavened bread, and that we find none for that cause ever killed, is
much for us: for then God did not execute any such Law, which (as Erastus
says) was broken by many: It is like God never made any such Law: 2. Because
it is said, he shall be cut off, who eats leavened bread, it follows not
that therefore this was done immediately by God; for it is said, Lev. 18. 29.
Whosoever does any of these abominations, even the soul that commits them,
shall be cut off from amongst the people; if that be killing; it is known, the
Magistrate was to kill such as committed incest, and did lie with beasts: But
Vatablus expounds it of Excommunication, thus, Id est, Deus non agnoscet
illum tanquam Israelitam and circumcisum: and Vatablus understood the Hebrew
Tongue better, then Erastus who professes he understands nothing of it. 3.
That which Erastus says of Paul, That God himself killed these at Corinth, who
did eat and drink unvvorthily; may as well insinuate the Magistrate should kill
with the sword, all that communicates unworthily (which is absurd) as it can
prove, that those that eat leavened bread were immediately killed of God.

Erastus. Those that eat leavened bread were debarred from the Page 241.
passover: But leavened bread signified, scelera, wickedness; Ergo, wicked
men should by us be debarred from the Sacraments. 1. It is false that those
that eat leavened bread were debarred from the passover by Gods command:
These two differ much; he that eats leavened bread shall be cut off, and he
that eats leaven shall be debarred from the feast of the passover, even as
these two; the child that clattereth in time of Sermon, shall be whipped with
rods, and the child that clattereth in time of Sermon shall be excluded from
hearing Sermon; when the Master forbids to clatter in time of Sermon, under
a punishment, he bids them not be absent from the Sermon: so when God
forbids to eat leaven, under a punishment, be forbids not to exclude the
man from the passover, the Lord commands both to be done.

Ans. 1. This is Erastus his Argument, not the Argument of To eat the Passover
with unleavened bread a violation of that Sacrament.
Beza, for eating of leaven signifies a scandalous and openly wicked man; and
if this be the Assumption, it is true, but the Syllogism so formed, shall
conclude against Erastus: 2. It is certain that God commands the Priests not
to violate his holy things, Ezech. 22. 26, Hag. 2. 11. 12. Ezech. 44. 8, 9, 10,
11. Else how failed they in keeping the charge of the Lord, in not differencing
between the clean and the unclean? Now to eat the passover with leavened bread
is an express violation of the holy things of God, Exodus 12. ver. 8. You shall
eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire and unleavened bread, ver. 11. And
thus shall ye eat it -- ver. 15. Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread,
even the first day, ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: 2. He that is
unclean is forbidden to eat the passover, Lev. 9. 13. The clean only is to
keep it: And he that is clean, and not on a journey, and keeps it not, that
man shall bear his sin; Ergo, the unclean are excepted; and he who is
sanctified according to the purification of the sanctuary only by the Law, is
to eat, 2 Chro. 3^. 9. Therefore Hezechiah prayed that God would pardon them
that were not so cleansed, ver. 18. To crave pardon presupposes a sin, Number.
9. 3, 4, 5, 6. But so it is, That he that eats unleavened bread in any of
these seven days, was unclean, and to be cut off for his uncleanness, and
transgressed this Ceremonial Law, Exodus 12. 8. 15. Levit. 9* 13. Ergo, he was
not to be admitted to the holy things of God, except the Priests and those who
had the charge of the Passover* should know him to be purified, Ezech. 22. 26.
Hag. 2. 11, 12. And we know it was the Priests part to pronounce any clean or
unclean, and that the passover was one of the chief of the holy things of God.
3. Erastus his conjecture, That he that did eat leavened bread, was not to
absent himself from the Passover; but to come tali modo, according to the Law:
As the child that clattereth in time of Sermon, is not bidden be absent from
the Sermon, may prove as well that no unclean, no heathen, or uncircumcised,
are forbidden to eat the Passover; for no Law of God forbids either to eat
the Passover, except this, that only the circumcised and the unclean were
forbidden; when the Lord in his Law puts an express and a differencing, or
discriminative character on those that eat, to wit, that they be circumcised
and clean who shall eat; Ergo, God, in that puts an evident inhibition on
those that are uncircumcised heathen and unclean, that they are not to eat, as
when God Commands every Male to be circumcised; we infer then no Female were
to be circumcised. And by this means the uncircumcised Moabite, the Philistine,
were not by the Priests and Porters debarred out of the Temple, or from the
Passover, so they would be circumcised and turn Jews: Even as the child is
not excluded by a command of the Master from hearing Sermon, only he is
forbidden to clatter in time of Sermon: But a Jew was both forbidden
uncleanness Ceremonial by an express Law, and by another Law he was
forbidden to come to the Passover; and a heathen, as heathen, was both
forbidden to eat, and the Priests forbidden to admit him.

Erastus. Though we should grant, That those that eat leaven were debarred from
the Passover; yet it shall not follow, that those that live wickedly, shall be
debarred from the Lords Supper, for the Feast of unleavened bread, typified not
the Supper of the Lord, but the whole time of our life: Otherwise, says he,
(in his Thesis) we may live wickedly all our days, except when we come to the
holy Supper; as Putting away of leaven.
the Jews might eat unleavened bread at any time, except on those days when
the Lord forbade them.

Ans. 1. We contend not, that debarring of men from any one Ordinance, was
signified by putting away of the Leaven: But that by putting of leaven from
their houses and Table, was typified (as Paul here expounds it) the putting
of a wicked person out the midst of the Church, 1 Cor. 5. 2. compared with ver.
5, 6, 7. 13. If the Feast of unleavened bread, typified all our life that we
should be holy; yet it had a special relation to our Purification, when we did
partake of the most holy Ordinances of God, such as was the Passover then, and
to us the Lords Supper: Else, Erastus might say, God has forbidden single
Christians to live at all, except they lived holily, which is a vain conceit.
It is not lawful to Erastus to put significations on types, it his will; and
therefore that that Feast pointed out holiness all our life, is utterly
denied; for eating of leavened bread, except in these days forbidden, was not
a sin, nor any Ceremonial type at all, no more then our common bread and wine
are signs of Christ's body and blood. 2. Paul compares the Feast to the lump
of the Visible Church; so as the leaven was to be removed out of all houses of
Israel; because it did Ceremonially infect, corrupt, and leaven them, and so
was to be purged; so did the in^^stuons man, leaven the Visible Church of
Corinth, and was to be purged out: Nor do I contend, that the Lords Supper here
is meant, though I know no solemn Spiritual Feast that the visible Church now
has, but the Supper of the Lord: But rather I understand, Church Communion in
the dain^ies of the Gospel, which are set forth to us under the similitude of a
Feast, Matthew. 22. Luke 14. 16, 17, 18, etc. Prove. 9. 2, 3, 4, 5. Cant. 5. 1.

Erastus. The leaven of the Passover does not so signify impurity of life,
that Excommunication can be hence gathered: therefore the Apostle alludeth to
that place, that or the like way, as the Jews did Celebrate their Passover
without leaven; so it becomes us to Celebrate our Passover without the leaven
of malice and wickedness: Leaven simply, may either signify good or evil, as
Matthew. 13. and 16. and Potuit, it might signify our natural corruption. For
God not only forbids to eat leaven, but to have it in the house; and leaven
signifies (...)sse so to be punished, as ye^ say, even by death.

Ans. The Leaven of the Passover, signified so impurity, as we are to put out
the person that leaveneth the Church, out of the Church, as they were to put
leaven out of the house; and not only simply, not to eat it; so are we not
only, not to eat and drink with a scandalous man, but he is to be reputed no
member of the Church, but a leavening and contagious man; and therefore Paul
does not here, as Erastus dreameth, show what way every one in his own
personal practice and duty, as a single Christian is to do, that he may save
his own soul; and therefore every one was to celebrate a Christian Passover in
his own soul, laying aside the leaven of malice: Though I grant, That Paul,
ver. 8. does infer and draw a conclusion of a personal purging out of the
leaven of malice and hypocrisy out of every man's heart: But Paul does expressly
command the Corinthians as a convened Church, to put out from amongst them
another man, for the saving of that other man's soul: And what they should do in
a Church society toward the man, (...), Who has done this, to wit, down right
they should Judge him, Cast him out, purge him out as a leavening piece. And
the world cannot give any other meaning of the words, then that, as the Jews
were to put all leaven from amongst them, when they were to celebrate their
Passover: So the Corinthians were to exercise the like work, upon this
incestuous man, and to put him out from amongst them, as one delivered to
Satan, as a lump of sour leaven; and we seek no more for Excommunication. 2.
Leaven signifies Matthew. 13. good, the Kingdom of God is compared to leaven:
But here it is corruption of contagious scandal in this incestuous man; and
such leaven as is to be cast out, and purged away. Now, I hope, we must not
purge out, and cast away the Kingdom of heaven: and Matthew. 16. 6. The leaven of
the corrupt and false Doctrine of Pharisees and Sadduces, that corrupts the
hearts of men, is meant, and of this leaven we are to beware: But why does
Erastus strive to bring the reader in a good opinion of leaven, which Paul
would have us to detest? I know not a reason, but because the place is so
evident for the casting out of an incestuous man from amongst the Corinthians,
lest he should infect the flock, and that by the Church convened together in
the name and power of Christ, that his soul may be saved; and this is the very
excommunication that we assert. 3. This leaven, (says he) may signify
natural corruption: Now Erastus puts us to (a may be,) but (a may be) will
not do it: For the Text says not, I hope, by Erastus his confession, that the
poor man must be delivered to Satan, that is, miraculously killed, for natural
concupiscence. All the world thus are delivered to Satan, as being heirs of
wrath for sin Original, at least in demerit. 2. The man was not judged, purged
out, and cast out, as leaven that sowred the Church, for natural corruption.
3. Paul offends not with them, that they were puffed and mourned not for the
man's Original sin, but for his actual wickedness, because he had gone in to
his fathers wife, an Abomination that the Gentiles are ashamed to name.

Erastus. Then the man must be killed, as he that eat leavened Page 244.
bread was killed: and though the punishments of Moses Law as such, must not be
brought in the Christian Church, yet if God subject men to the Magistrates
Sword, men cannot free them from it, though there may be degrees of punishment.

Ans. We denied that those that eat leavened bread with the Passover were
killed, but only excommunicated and cut off from the congregation: God never
subjected any to the sword, for that cause. 2. We deny that therefore by
proportion the incestuous man should be killed; by what consequence will
Erastus prove that those that gathered sticks on the Lords day, those that are
stubborn to Father or Mother, those who commit fornication now in the Israel of
God under the New Testament, must be stened to death by the Magistrate, or
miraculously killed by the Apostles? it must be by the same consequence, that
Erastus reasons here. But did God kill immediately any offenders at all for
original sin, some one more nor other? as Erastus dreameth this man was
killed. 3. What warrant has Erastus that the Devil kills any one of the
visible Church now under the New Testament, and any of the children of God,
whose spirit are saved in the day of the Lord? proferat tabulas. Erastus says
it, neither Prophet nor Apostle in the Old or New Testament ever said it.

Erastus said, an Anagogicall sense is not concludent.

Ans. Where the Holy Ghost gives the sense, it is false, says Beza. 2. Why
does then Erastus conclude miraculous killing from the Types of the Old
Testament?

Erastus. Where I pray you does Paul say that the punishment of eating leavened
bread did typifie your Excommunication?

Ans. The word Excommunication may be by the Church used as the Word,
Sacrament, Trinity. But the thing is not ours, but an ordinance of Jesus
Christ. 2. Paul says in this very place, as Israel were to put away leaven in
their Passover, so is the convened Church of Corinth in the name and power of
Christ to put out, judge and purge out a corrupting and leavening incestuous
man, and this is all we seek for Excommunication.

Erastus. I never find the name of the Passover in the New Page 245.
Testament put for the Supper of the Lord.

Ans. We are not in such need of that interpretation, as to put the name of the
one for the other. But let Erastus show where he reads that the thing, to
wit, that the one Sacrament succeeded to the other; and Beza may thence infer
his point, if God would have no man to eat the Passover with leavened bread,
and if eating of leavened bread, and bread it self was to be put out of all
the houses of Israel, thereby signifying that incestuous and scandalous persons
are to be cast out of the Church, and so from the Sacraments; let Erastus see
what Beza has said amiss here.

Erastus. God would have the Jews to eat the Passover without leavened
bread, that they might remember of their wonderful deliverance out of the hard
bondage of Egypt, and of the deliverance of their first borne.

Ans. Reverend Beza says thesetwo were bypast benefits remembered De Presbyt.
page 92.
in that Sacrament: But we have the Holy Ghost expounding that ^he putting away
of leavened bread, did typifie the purging out of the incestuous men, and other
scandalous persons out of the Church, which is our point, otherwise let Erastus
show us what is meant by (...) the whole Mass and lump, for it signifies
either one single man; Or 2. The Mass and body of the visible Church, of which
the incestuous man was a Member; or some third thing, which Erastus and his
What is meant by the whole lump; and what by leaven.
followers must teach us. Now the whole lump can neither signify the
incestuous man, nor any other single member of the Church. Not the incestuous
man, 1. He was not the whole lump in danger to be leavened, for he was the
leven, then he was not the lump in danger to be leavened; for the one is the
agent infecting, the other the patient infected. The whole lump was the thing
out of which the leaven was to be removed, the terminus a quo, the incestuous
man was to be purged out, therefore the leaven cannot signify wickedness in
abstracto, as Erastus says, but the wicked man in concreto; for the leaven
must signify that which is cast out, (...), out of the midst of them, v. 2.
Now this was not incest, but the man that had his fathers wife, and had done
that deed. 2. Again, the leaven was the person to be delivered to Satan, that
had a soul to be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. But wickedness in
abstracto is not delivered to Satan, nor has it a Spirit to be saved in the
day of the Lord. 3. The leaven is such a one as is to be judged, as is within
the Church, v. 12. and is called a brother, with whom we are not to eat, v. 11.
now this cannot be said of wickedness in abstracto. But neither can the whole
lump be one single man; 1. One single man needed not the solemn conveening of
the Church in the Name and power of the Lord Jesus, for his personal purging,
for his personal purging is not a Church-act, but an act of a man's daily
conversation and Christian walking. 2. The purging out, and the casting out is
(...), v. 2 out of the midst of them, then there was a society to be purged;
Ergo, not a single man only. Much more I said before, which cannot but mist
Erastus, or any his followers, except they expound this whole lump to be the
body of the visible Church of Corinth. 2. So Gal. 5. 9. he adds v. 10. he
that troubles you, (the lump in danger to be leavened,) shall bear his
judgment, v. 12. I would they were cut off that trouble you. Then the whole
Churches of Galatia were the troubled lump, and so it must be here, if this
truth be so convincing out of the Text, let any Erastian extricate himself, if
he can deny, but here is a Church-lump, a Church of Rulers (...) gathered
together in the Name and power of the Lord Jesus, that purges out of it self
leaven, not wickedness, in abstracto, as I have demonstrated, but a wicked man
named a brother, lest he leaven the whole Church, to the end his Spirit may be
saved; Judge reader, if this be not name, nature and thing, of that which
Erastians deny, to wit, of Excommunication. I humbly provoke them to make good
sense of the 1 Cor. 5. and show me what is the wicked man. 2. The casting out
of the midst of you. 3. The saving of his Spirit. 4. The convened together
court, instructed with the Name, and authority, and power of Christ, and if
this be not a Church power, efficacion, and authoritative, being steeled with
the power of the Head of the Church. 5. What is the leaven? 6. What is the act
of leavening? 7. What is the whole lump? 8. What is the purging out, putting
out, and judging of the man? 3. We know Erastus denies any Church Government
at all, but some acts of punitive justice in the Magistrate. But the Churches
praying, consenting that a scandalous person shall be delivered to Satan, or
some other ways punished by the Christian Magistrate, are acts of Church
government, so proper to the Church, as the Magistrate as the Magistrate,
cannot exercise such Acts.

way to Satan, by miraculous killing of him; and whereas it is said, that they
may learn not to blaspheme: Judges speak so when they kill Murderers and
Thieves that he shall teach them to do so no more by taking the head from them.

Ans. That word of a judge killing a man for Murder, Sir, I Will teach you
other manners then to kill, can no ways be ascribed to Paul, who does not
scoff so at taking away men's lives. Paul who wished to be separated from
Christ, for the contumacious Jews, and would not kill any by Satan, since his
rod and power was for edification, 2 Cor. 10. 8. and that the Spirit may be
saved in the day of the Lord, 1 Cor. 5. 5. he speaks more gravely and less
imperiously, and without boasting and jeering in a matter of Salvation. 2.
(...) that they may be instructed or disciplined not to blaspheme; cannot be
simply that they may blaspheme no more, because killed by the Devil. For 1.
let Erastus in the Old or New Testament produce a parallel place for that
Exposition, where the word (...) to be instructed is ascribed to the dead; but
this is a common fault in all Erastus his expositions of Scripture, that they
want all ground in Scripture, Erastus his expositions all without ground of
Scripture.
as let me put upon all the followers of Erastus to give a parallel to this
Exposition of Mat. 18. Let him be to thee, that is, to thee only, when Christ
speaks of a general Rule of all that scandalizeth. 2. Let him be as a
Heathen. Give a place of Scripture for this. 1. Let him be as such Heathen
only as acknowledge Caesar, and his Deputies for lawful Judges. 2. A parallel
for this we seek, Let him be as a Heathen, that is, convene him before an
heathen Judge. 3. What Scripture expounds delivering to Satan for
edification, and not destruction, 1 Cor. 5. to be a Magistraticall killing by
the power of the Devil, that others may fear. 4. Put out, purge out, judge
those only that are within, are expounded by Erastus, pray for a miraculous
destruction by the devil, as the lictor and hangman of the Apostle, that none
may be killed miraculously for enormous scandals, no not such as Elimas the
sorcerer, who was never within the Church; but those that are within: And did
the company of the Saints, pray with the Saints, that signs and wonders, and
so miraculous killing might be wrought, not on any but on those that are within
the visible Church, not on the enemies, and Jews haters of Christ, and without
the Christian Churches, when the Apostles miraculously escaped out of their
prisons? Act. 4. 29, 30. Act. 5. 19, 20, 21, 22. Act. 12. 7, 8, 9. Act. 16. 25,
26. 27, 28? I might allege many other such like interpretations of Erastus. 5.

never any such thing is ascribed to the dead. Gal. 5. 22, 30. Tit. 2. 20. Rev.

cites in the margent, 1 Cor. 5. 5. to expound it of excommunicating of
Hymeneus and Alexander, so does Piscator, so Calvin, Beza, Marlorat, so
Vatablus says, Quos eje^i ex ecclesia et censui magis dignos esse ecclesia
Satane quam Christi, si non resipiscant. 7. Beza De Presbyt. p. 87. learnedly
observes that it is no Grammar; for if the effect of learning not to blaspheme
be suspended upon the miraculous killing of Alexander, then he was first
killed, and then learned not to blaspheme. But so Paul could have said he was
killed, ut non blasphameret, that he might not blaspheme, not that he might
learn not to blaspheme.

CHAP. XII.
Quest. 8.
The eschewing of company with the scandalous, vindicated from Erastus his
exceptions.

BEsides other arguments from Mat. 18. and 1 Cor. 5. for excommunication, we
argue thus: Those upon whom the Church is to put such a public note of shame
or a (...), as they are to withdraw from their company, and not to eat and
drink with them, those are cast out of the Church, and so cut off from the body
of Christ, and excommunicated.

But the Church is to put such a note of shame, as to withdraw from the company
of, and not to eat with those that are named brethren, and yet are fornicators,
covetous, idolators, extortioners, railers, 1 Cor. 5. 11. and cause divisions
and offenses contrary to the Doctrine of the Gospel, who serve not the Lord
Jesus, but their own belly, Romans 16. 17, 18* who walk disorderly, are
busybodies, idle, and obey not the Doctrine of the Apostles. 2 These. 3. 11,
12, 13, 14, 15, Ergo.

The proposition I prove, 1 Cor. 5. 11. he says, v. 9. I wrote to you in an
Epistle, not to keep company with fornicators, the same word that in the
abstract is spoken of the incestuous man, v. 1. by which it is clear Paul had
forbidden any company with such incestuous men. Now he had not forbidden them
to keep company with dead men, if the man was to be miraculously killed, Ergo,
it was his will before, that such a one should be judged, and put out, else he
could not so sharply rebuke them, for not casting him out, and if now only he
had first taught, and written to them to cast him out: as if excommunication
had been in this same very Chapter instituted by Paul, and v. 11. (...) now I
have written unto you, not to keep company with one named a brother, who is a
fornicator; this must be in the same Chapter, for (...) now I have written,
must be in relation to this v. 9. I wrote unto you in a Epistle before: now if
here at this present he wrote to them, not to keep company with him, it must be
when he commands to cast him out v. 13. and to judge him v. 12. so that not
to keep company with such fornicators, must necessarily presuppose a casting
out, and that the fornicator, with whom we are not to keep company in a
familiar manner, is a man cast out of the Church, and so excommunicated. 2.
Paul would never forbid brotherly familiarity with any remaining a brother, a
member of the Church, and of a body with us in visible profession of the truth,
as partakers of one body and blood of Christ, as all the members of the Church
eating at one Lords table are, 1. Cor. 10. 16, 17. 3. The Apostle says such a
fornicator is but (...) named* a brother, and so in the esteem of the Church no
brother, and so not of the visible body of Christ. 4. Paul brings in this as
a reason why they should cast out the incestucus man, v. 9. did not (says he)
I write to you before, and do I not now write, v. 11. even now that you are not
to k^ep intimate familiarity with such titular brethren, who are brethren in
name only? Therefore put out from amongst you this man, v. 13. the Apostles
argument to infer they ought to judge, and put such a man out of the Church;
because they are not to eat with him, were of no weight, if this ^schewing of
familiarity with one who is a brother only in name, did not infer the Churches
casting of him ou^.

Erastus. it is false that Paul forbids to eat with him who is cast L. 3. c*
8. p. 247. 248*
out, for he forbids not eating with a dead man.

Ans. This is to beg the question, Erastus should teach us how Paul's argument
cohereth; for the text says, he must be cast out; why? you must not eat with
him; then he supposes he must be a living man, for Paul needed not fear they
would eat with dead men, nor can this be Paul's consequence; you are not to eat
with the incestuous, Ergo, he must be delivered to Satan, that he may be
miraculously killed; for that is a false consequence, for then all covetous
persons, all drunkards* all idolators, all extortioners, should have been
killed by Paul, because with none of these we are to eat.

Erastus. It is false that Paul forbids as to eat meat with such; Page 248.
Yea in no place he forbids to eat with heathen, but elsewhere grants it
to be lawful, and in this Chapter he permits private commerce with them.

Ans. 1. Let the reader judge whether Erastus resuteth Paul, or Beza, Paul
forbids to eat with a brother; that is a fornicator: Erastus says, he
forbids no such thing. 2. Though I think Christians may eat with heathens,
1. Cor. 10. 27. and that Paul did eat with heathen; yet it is no argument to
say, it is therefore lawful to eat with one cast out of the Church, because we
may eat How eschewing intimate fellowship with a scandalous brother, is a
Churchcensure.
with heathens to gain them, and we are not bidden abstain from heathens
company, that they may be ashamed of their religion, (though Christians are to
use no heathens with intimate familiarity as we do our brethren in Christ;) But
we are to eschew entire fellowship with a scandalous and cast out brother, to
gain him, that he may be ashamed, 2 These. 3. 14. and in this a scandalous
brother is in worse case then a heathen: But in other respects he is in better
condition, as being under the medicine of the Church.

3. Though we may have commerce, and buy and ^ell with heathens, and neglect no
dutie^ of humanity to them, as to receive them into our house, and to be
hospital to them, Heb. 13. 2. Job 31. 32. Yet this will conclude entire
fellowship with neither heathen, or scandalous brethren; Yea, we are not to
receive a false teacher into our house, 2. Ioh. ver. 10. Yet are we not
forbidden to neglect duties of common humanity to false Teachers, though we be
forbidden entireness of Brotherly fellowship with them.

Erastus. There is not the same reason of holy things, and of private civil
things; for this, not eating, belongs to private conversing with men, not to
public Communion with them in the holy things of God: One says, It is in our
liberty, Whether we converse familiarly with wicked men, or not, But it is not
in our power, Whether we come to the Lords Supper, or not; And Paul will not
have us to deny any thing that belongs to Salvation; and therefore he says,
2 Thessalonians. 3. Admonish him as a Brother; and none, I hope, can deny, but the
Sacraments are helps of godliness and Salvation.

Ans. 1. It is true, that avoiding of the company of scandalous Brethren, has
in it something civil; but it is a censure-spirituall, and a Church-censure,
two ways: 1. Objectively, in its tendency, Respectu termini ad quem. 2.
Effectively, in its rise and cause, Respectu termini a quo, it is a spiritual
censure Objectively, because it tends to make the party ashamed, that he may
repent, and become a Brother with whom we are to converse; and therefore is
destinated for no civil use, but for the good of his soul, that is a member of
a Church, that he may return to what he was. 2. This censure, though one
private Brother may exercise it upon another, yea, a woman on a man, who yet
has no Authority over the man, is notwithstanding in its rise and efficient
cause, a Church-censure. 1. If Christ will not have one Brother to condemn
another, while first he rebuke him; and if he be not convinced, while he do the
same before two or three witnesses; and if he yet be not gained, one private
Brother may not after conviction, before two or three witnesses repute him as a
Heathen, or complain of him before an Heathen Judge, as Erastus says; How
shall we imagine any one single Brother may withdraw Brotherly fellowship from
another Brother, by his own private Authority, while he first be sentenced
before the Church? And the Church shall convince him to walk disorderly, to
cause divisions and offenses, to be a Fornicator, a Covetous person, and so to
be unworthy of the entire Brotherly fellowship of another? For if this order
were not in the Church, every Brother might take up a prejudice at his Brother,
and so break all bands of Religious Communion, and Brotherly fellowship, and
dissolve and make ruptures in the Churches: Now certain it is, These Texts,
Romans 16. 17, 18. 2 These. 3. 11, 12, etc* in the letter, intimate no such order
as is Matthew. 18. But it is presupposed, as clear by other Scriptures, we are
not to withdraw from an offending Brother, but after such an order: Now the
places in the letter, except we expound them by other Scriptures, do not bear
that we are to rebuke our Brother, before we withdraw from him, contrary to
Levit. 19. 17. 2. If I am to withdraw from a Brother, all Brotherly fellowship
by these places; then I am to esteem him as a Heathen, and as a Brother in
name, not in reality, 1 Cor. 5. 11. Whereas once I esteemed him a Brother, and
did keep Brotherly fellowship with him; now this is materially Excommunication*
I do no more in this kind to one who is formally Excommunicated; yea, I am not
so strange to a Heathen; Ergo, This I must have done upon some foregoing
sentence of the Church, otherwise, I might un-Church and un-Brother the man
whom the Church neither has, nor can, un-Church and un-Brother. 3. Eschewing
of Brotherly fellowship to any, is an act of Government distinct from the
Preaching of the Word, tending to make a Brother that walks disorderly
ashamed, that he may repent, and of a Brother in name only, may become a
Brother in reallity, 2 These. 3. 14. But this act of Government belongs not to
the Christian Magistrate; for every Brother (says Erastus) may exercise it
toward his Brother; Ergo, here is Church Government that the Magistrate has no
hand in, contrary to the way of Erastus, and not in the hands of Pastors, for
it is distinct from Preaching; nor is it in a College of Pastors, Doctors, and
Elders, for Erastus denies any such College; Ergo, here every one must govern
another, the man the woman, and the woman the man; the son the father, if he
walk unorderly, and the Father the Son; this can be nothing, but the greatest
Confusion on Earth. 4. To put any to shame, especially publicly, by way of
punishment for public sins, must come from some Judges, or others armed with
Authority, Judge. 18. 7. 1 Cor. 4. 14. 1 Cor. 6. 5. 1 Cor. 25. 34. Then the
Apostles sense cannot be, that every one has power of himself without the
Church, or any authority there from to put his brother to shame; for when a
brother is not to eat with a scandalous brother, he must be convinced by the
Church to be scandalous, and so cast our, 1 Cor. 5. 11, 12, 13. as we have
proved before, and every man here should be his own judge, and party in his
own cause, except he put his brother to some shame by an higher authority then
his own. The word (...), is to put a public note or (...) upon the offender.
So Stephanus. So Piscator, Nota ignominiosa excommunicationis. Pomponius laetus
de Magistr. Romans ^. 21. Censores quinto^ quoque anno creari solebant, hic
prorsus cives sic notabantur, ut qui Senator esset ejece^etur Senatu, qui eques
Romanus equum publicum perderet, etc. Mathaeus Harnish and Gec. Gabellus, who
add to Zanchius his Commentary in 2 These. say, Est not ^ quadam insignire, et
in aliquem animadvertere; ut censores apud Romanos notare aliquem solebant,
they expound it the public note of Excommunication. Beza says it is not (...)
to signify and declare, but (...) notate, and veluti inusta not a compungite.
So Calvin, Marlorat.

And I wonder that Erastus can say with any, that it is in our power to
converse, or not to converse with wicked men; are we not discharged by Gods
Spirit to converse with them? As we are commanded to eat and drink at the
Lords Table, and is it in our power morally to obey, or disobey any
Commandment of God? Except Erastus will say with Papists, that God does here
give counsels, not commands, Romans 16. 17. 2 These. 3. 14. 1 Cor. 5. 9, 11.

And whereas Erastus says, Paul will have us 2 These. 3. 15. to admonish this
man as a brother; Ergo, In holy things, and in the Sacraments* that are helps
of piety and Salvation, we are not to ^ast him off: It is true, the cast out
man is not to be reputed as an enemy, but a brother. Yet a sick and diseased
brother, under the roughest Medicine of the Church, to wit, the rod of
Excommunication, that the Spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord. But
withdrawing of brotherly fellowship, is not a mere civil unbrothering of him,
for if the brotherly fellowship of Christians must be spiritual, religious,
and for the edifying of one another souls, for exhorting one another, to
prevent hardening of heart, for provoking one another to love, and to good
works, to teach one another, to comfort and support one another, as we are
expressly commanded by the Holy Ghost, Heb. 3. 13. Heb. 10. 24. Col. 3. 16. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 11, 14. Mal. 3. 16. Jer. 50. 5. Zach. 8. 22. Psalm. 42. 4. I wonder
where Erastus learned this Divinity, to say, the denying of this edifying
Communion to a scandalous brother, while he be ashamed and repent, Is to deny
nothing that belongs to his salvation: Admonition is but one of twenty
comfortable acts of Communion, which we deny not to him, least the man should
despair, and we should cast off all care, hope, or intention to save his soul,
whereas the genuine and intrinsecall intention of avoiding him, and casting him
out of the Church, is, that he may be saved: Lastly, we deny not admonition,
and preaching of the word to the man, thus cast out, because they be converting
Ordinances, simply necessary to work the man's humiliation and repentance; but
the Lords Supper is a confirming Ordinance, and denied to the excommunicated
while he is in that condition upon that very reason, that it is denied to
Pagans and Heathens; and though it be an help of piety, it is no help either to
a Pagan, or an excommunicate man, but damnation: But it may be, the
excommunicate man has faith. I answer, To us in the Court of the Church, in
which the Seals are dispensed, Sacraments though helps of piety, yet not to be
given to all.
he has no more then a Heathen has; and therefore, in confirming Ordinances,
he is looked on by the Church as an Heathen; and if the reason of Erastus be
good, The Church is to deny no helps of godliness and salvation to him, though
we deny private food to his body, because the Sacraments are necessary helps.
Then 1. I much doubt, if the Church be to deny the necessary helps of
godliness and salvation to a Pagan living amongst us; Ergo, shall we not deny
the Sacraments to a Pagan? 2. We are not to avoid his company, Erastus p. 248.
^^^erum sacrament^ esse adminicula pi^tatis and salutis, nullus ^^gat, proi^de
non sunt h^^, ^^ganda petentibus, etc.
and deny the edifying acts of Communion, which I named before, for these are
necessary helps of salvation. 3. It is not the man's sin by this reason, That he
eats and drinks unworthily; for if it be not the Churches sin to give him
the seals, because the Seals are adminiclees and helps of piety, and saving of
the soul; by the same reason, it is not the man's sin to receive the Lords
Supper, for it must be equally an help of godliness and salvation to the
Communicant receiving, as to the Church giving: Now Paul says, 1 Cor. 11. He
that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks to himself judgment.
So Erastus teaches us, that it may be a sin to Swine publicly known to be
such, to receive pearls, when it is no sin, but the Churches duty to give
these pearls to such known Swine, which is most absurd and impious.

Erastus. I said before, that God does not exclude sinners from the Page 249.
Sacraments, but gather them in to them, that they may be more and more invited
to repentance, and more easily raised up again; for Sacraments, and so many
Ceremonies also, were for this end ordained, that they might draw men to the
love and care of true piety and holiness, as Moses says, Deuteronomy. 14.

Ans. Erastus acknowledges this to be no new Argument; therefore we may pass
it, it is the chief pillar of his opinion: But I put it in form thus, to
Erastus.

Those whom God inviteth to repentance, those he will not exclude from the
Sacraments: But now under the Gospel, he inviteth all, even many Pagans and
Heathen to repentance, 1 Timothy 2. 4. God will have all, even Heathen
Magistrates, to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, so Act.
17. 30. God now commands all men, every where, even the Idolators, and blind
Philosophers at Athens, who erected an Altar to the unknown God, ver. 23. and
who jeered at the Doctrine of the Resurrection, ver. 32. even those God
inviteth to repentance; Ergo, God excludes not Pagans from the Sacraments; but
the conclusion is absurd and blasphemous; therefore so must one of the premises
be, but the Assumption is Scripture; Ergo, The Major Proposition of Erastus
must be blasphemous. God inviteth scorners to repentance, and rebukes are means
of repentance; Ergo, we may rebuke scorners; Gods spirit says, Rebuke not a
scorner, Prove. 9. 7, 8. His Proposition then must be, Those whom God inviteth
to repentance, those God excludes not from any mean of piety and sanctity: It
is most false, God inviteth Dogs and Swine to repentance, and commands them
to be holy, and the pearls of the Gospel are means of repentance, and
holiness: Must we therefore, Cast pearls to dogs and swine? The contrary our
Savior injoyneth, Matthew. 7. 6. 2. Moses, Deuteronomy. 14. 1. forbids diverse
Ceremonies and Sacraments of the Heathen by this Argument: Ye are the children
of the Lord your God; and he says expressly, that the stranger may eat some
unclean thing, but the Lord says to them, You shall not do so, for thou art an
holy people to the Lord thy God: Whence it is evident Moses says point blank
contrary to Erastus; for Moses says, that Ceremonies and Sacraments are for
this end, to draw only the holy and sanctified people of God, to a further love
and study of true piety and sanctity; was not the eating of the Passover a
mean of Repentance, as well as the eating of the Lords Supper? no question, but
God invited the uncircumcised to repentance, but forbids them to eat the
Passover.

Beza said, Sinners were indeed called to the sacrifices, but such as
professed repentance.

Erastus says, Then ^^e agree, for we dispute only of those who Erastus his
contradiction, in excluding both some and none at all from the Sacraments.
acknowledges their sins, and promise amendment.

Ans. We are not willing to hold up a needless controversy with Erastus; but
Erastus says, and his Arguments conclude in the Old Testament, None for Moral
uncleanness, and impenitency were debarred from the holy things of God; Ergo,
We are to debar none in the New Testament; yea, 2. Paul did never command to
debar any, nor did Christ debar Judas, nor the Pharisees debar the ^ewdest
Publicans, nor the Apostles Simon Magus from the Sacraments; Ergo, says he, we
are to debar none at all: now Page 249. Nam de illis solis (an arcendi sint a
Sacramentis) disputamus qui peccatum suum agnoscunt, and ^eliora promittunt.
here Erastus clearly contradicts himself, and says, We dispute only of such
as acknowledge their ^ins and promise amendment: But let Erastus say, Did Judas
acknowledge his ^in and promise amendment: Did all the morally unclean in
Corinth, such as repented not of their uncleanness, and fornication, and
lasciviousness which they committed, 2 Cor. 12. 21. acknowledge their sin, and
promise amendment? and did those that were partakers of the Table of Devils
acknowledge their sin and promise amendment? And yet I brought the very words
of Erastus, in which he says right down in a Catholic assertion, without
exception, not any of those are to be debarred from the Sacraments: Why? The
Sacraments (says he) are Adminicula pi^tatis, et resipiscentiae, are helps to
godliness and repentance: And I ask of Erastus, does the Lord invite none to
repentance, but those that do acknowledge their sin and promise amendment? And
will Erastus have helps of repentance denied to all those who acknowledge not
their sins? then let him give us Arguments in the Old or New Testament, by
which he can demonstrate, that those who acknowledge not their sins, and
promise not amendment, are debarred in the Old Testament, from all the holy
things of God, and in the New, from the Sacraments: Let Erastus extricate
himself if he can.

It is worthy consideration, whether Erastus will have all those only that
acknowledged their sins and repent, admitted to the holy things of God in the
Old Testament; if not, he must show a difference, why pearls might be cast to
Swine, and scorners rebuked, and holy things profaned by the uncircumcised and
profane in the old Testament, not in the New: this he shall not show, if they
were debarred who repented not, how says he in all his book, that none were
debarred from the holy things of God in the Old Testament for Moral
uncleanness?

Erastus. But we impugn this which you say, that God has ordained Page 249.
Presbyters or Elders to be judges and examinators of that business: But we
say, that God neither commanded in the Old, or New Testament, that Priests or
any other, should examine those who brought oblations for sin, whether they did
truly repent, or dissemble only; and ye say there be chosen Elders who should
try this in the New Testament.

Ans. 1. Elsewhere I have proved from Scripture, that the Priests did try
judicially, those for whom they offered Sacrifice: If the Leaper had not bidden
so many days as the Law required, if the Priests should offer for him, he
should be partial in the Law, and if the disease be not removed, he cannot
offer for him, Matthew. 8. 4. Lev. 14. 3, 4 9* 10, 11, 12*

2. Observe good Reader, How craftily Erastus passes from one question to
another: All his Arguments hitherto, both in his Thesis and in his Book,
conclude that no man, in either Old, or New Testament, ever was, or ought to be
debarred from the holy things of God: Because there is neither precept, nor
promise, nor practice in Moses, in the Prophets, or Apostles for it: 2.
Because, The Sacraments are helps of repentance. 3. Because all are invited and
commanded to come. Now here Erastus flies to another Question: Whether the
unworthy should be debarred by Priests in the Old, and by certain select and
chosen Elders in the New Testament? This is a far other Question: for let him
answer our Arguments, by which we prove that pearls and the holy things of God,
ought to be denied to all Dogs, Swine, and profane men, whereas Erastus says,
all those are invited to come; and then we shall yoke with Erastus, or any
other, by whom, or by whose authority these pearls ought to be denied: whether
by the Church, that is, by the Elders of the Church, and people consenting, or
by the civil Magistrate. Now this latter question to Erastus, is no question
at all* for if none ought to be debarred from the Sacraments at all; but all
must come promiscuously, as their own good or evil spirit inclines them, it
is a vain thing for Erastus to make any question at all, by whom they ought to
be debarred; for it is all one, as to ask the question, by whom should those
who are to be gradued Doctors of Physic, be tried and examined, whether by the
faculty, and College of of Physicians of the place, or by none at all: If you
lay down this ground, that there neither is, nor ought to be any graduated
Doctors at all in the world, the other of those, who are to try those who are
graduated is vain, if all be invited to a free banquet, poor, and rich,
leaper, and clean: it is a vain question, whether be there some Masters of the
house who should try who are worthy, and to be admitted to the feast, and who
unworthy, and to be debarred.

Erastus. It is madness to say, that Paul by forbidding private ^ating, Page
249. 250.
does understand nothing but a debarring from the Sacraments, for 1* Cor. 11.
he debarreth none from the Sacrament.

Ans. Neither Beza, nor any of ours say, that they are both one How withdrawing
from scandalous brethren, may infer excommunication.
punishment; but that where we are forbidden to eat with a scandalous brother,
it is presumed the Church does cast him out of her society: nor does Paul 1
Cor. 11. invite all to come to the supper.

Beza said, he to whom less is denied, as that we eat not with him, in our
private houses, to him more is denied, to wit, that he should not be admitted
to the Lords supper.

Erastus says, that to whom less is denied, to him more is denied, is Page
250. 251.
true in gifts, but not in punishments, and in things of the same kind, but not
in things diverse, and in things free, not in things of which one is commanded
by God, and another thing not commanded; it holds not in punishments, he to
whom the city is denied, and who is banished, his life is not denied to him, he
who is punished in his purse, is not killed; for that a father denies to his
son an unworthy thing, yet he denies not raiment to him.

Ans. Erastus in this grants he wrongeth Beza, as if he had said, to deny a
private table, and the Lords table, were one and the same punishment. Beza
says, the one is a less, the other a greater punishment. 2. If it be true in
gifts, that he to whom less is given, more is given, then it holds here in
our case; because private fellowship with the Saints is a gift of God, and if
the Lords body given for us, and to us in the Lords supper, be not a greater
gift, it is nothing: so then if a less gift be denied, the Lords supper a
greater gift is denied. 2. It must hold in the private punishments, inflicted
for an higher punishments cause, private communion with the Saints is denied,
because the man is cast out of the Church; Ergo, far more are the highest
privileges of the Church denied: as liberty is denied to a man, because he is
condemned to dye; Ergo, far more is life denied to him; a man's house is
denied to him, because he is banished; Ergo, far more is his city and
country denied to him: But a man is not punished in his purse, because he is
condemned to dye, it follows no^; Ergo, he should rather dye, because the one
punishment is not relative to the other. 3 Because not eating with a scandalous
man is a spiritual punishment, as I have proved: therefore it is of that same
kind with excommunication, and therefore it holds here. 4. Abstinence from
the private fellowship of a scandalous brother is not free, but commanded of
God, and so is debarring from the Lords supper, not free, but commanded.

Erastus. when he forbids (...), no not to eat, he forbids, 1. Page 252.
Near communion of familiarity. 2. Not to eat with them, which is to forbid all
signs of near communion.

Ans. It is clear he proves they should cast him out, because I wrote to you
that you should not keep company with such, v. 9. no more to eat with such;
Ergo, far less (would he say) should he be a leavening member in the lump
and mass of Christ's body.

Erastus. I wrote unto you, that ye should not keep company with such; then
Paul speaks here of a thing, concerning which he had spoken before, though
they understood him not: it is like they sought Paul's judgment of their
conversing with men: But of delivering the man to Satan, he had not spoken
before, as is clear in the Text.

Ans. This is a strong argument for us, if Paul had never spoken, nor written
to them of the delivering of the man to Satan, that is, of the miraculous
killing of him, how could he in reason and conscience chide them, because they
prayed not that he might be miraculo^sly killed? (...)? it is not possible they
could mourn for not joining in a business, that Paul had never revealed to
them to be Gods will. Yea it is a strong argument to me, that delivering to
Satan was excommunication, of which he had taught them before, (else their
mourning had been unreasonble) and which he pointed at to them as a limb of
excommunication, to wit, their not familier conversing with the scandalous.

Erastus. And when he has show^n how they ought to flee the company Page 252.
of the scandalous, he returns to his former purpose, commanding the wicked
man to be killed: This then he says, I commanded you to eschew the company of
wicked brethren, not of the heathen, whom the Lord shall judge.

Ans. 1. The Text can bear no such exposition, for the reasons I have given
before. 2. The coherence is clear; I wrote before that you should not keep
company with wicked brethren: therefore put out that wicked man from amongst
you. But by Erastus his gloss, there is neither sense, nor coherence in the
words.

Erastus. The end of refusing familiar conversing with the scandalous, Page
252. 253.
is, that he may be ashamed; and you say, that same is the end of debarring
from the supper; then it must follow, as private conversing can do the
contrary, to wit, it can soment and nourish sins, both in the brother we
converse with, and in us, so the frequent use of the Lords supper should
nourish vices in us, which were wickedness to think.

Ans. This presumes, that to avoid a scandalous brother, and to debar him
from the Sacraments, must be formally one, which we teach not. 2. Hence it
follows, since they be diverse formally, they cannot have the same formal and
intrinsecall ends. 3. The frequent eating at the Lords table, in a scandalous
man, does dispose him more and more to sin, as frequently sinning inclines
more to sin; but this is by the frequent abusing of Gods ordinance, and not
from the nature of the Sacrament.

Erastus. Paul forbids not ill men of the company of good men, Page 253.
but he admonishes good men, to flee ill men, that they may be ashamed. But
when you deuy the Sacraments to any, you command not the Godly not to come to
the supper with the wicked, but you forbid the scandalous to come to the supper.

Ans. There is no solidity in this conjecture, it leans upon the perpetual
m^stake of Erastus in all this dispute, as if we held, That to be debabred from
familiar fellowship with the Saints, and from the Sacrament, were one and the
same thing: Else, I see no conclusion that Erastus does, or can infer against
us. 2. It is false, that wicked men are not discharged the company of Saints;
for in so far as fellowship with the Saints, is a spiritual mean of the
gaining of their souls by Teaching, Exhorting, Edifying, Comforting the wicked
and scandalous, being Dogs and Swine are forbidden to touch such a Pearl; Yea,
God lays a charge on wicked men, while they remain in that case, not to
meddle with Confirming Ordinances (with some Converting Ordinances they may,)
as Psalm. 50. 16. But to the wicked God said, What have thou to do to declare my
Statutes: or that thou take my Convenant in thy mouth? 17. Seeing thou hate
Instruction, and castest my Word behind thee. Here the wicked are forbidden to
Teach or speak, to the instructing of others, which is a special act of
Christian fellowship between Brother and Brother, Col. 3. 16. Heb. 3. 13. Heb.
10. 24. 1 These. 5. 11. 14. Because they hate to be Instructed of others: And
you know how Christ The scandalous are forbidden to come to the Sacraments.
speaks to the unworthy intruder of himself on the secrets and spiritual
marrow and comforts of the Gospel, Matthew. 22. ver, 12. Friend, How came thou
here, not having thy Wedding garment? Ezra 4. 3. But Zerubbabel and Joshua, and
the rest of the chief of the Fathers came and said unto the Adversaries of
Judah and Benjamin, You have nothing to do with us, to build an house unto our
God; But we our selves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel: Does
not God expressly forbid David to build an house to his name? 1 Chronicles. 22. 8. 2 Chronicles. 6. 9. And we know it is a typical discharge laid upon men of blood,
not to touch the holiest things of God; but that men of Peace must meddle with
them, Isa. 1. 13. Bring no more vain Oblations, etc. All which holds forth,
that not only those who have the charge of the house of the Lord, to see that
no Swine and Dogs profane the holy things of God; but they are forbidden all
private Ordinances and public, in so far as they can make no other use of
them, but to defile them.

Erastus says, They be wickedly forbidden to come to the Lords Supper, who
desire to Celebrate the memorial of his death.

Beza Replieth well, 1. What if he know not what he desires who comes? 2.
What if there be just suspicion or clear evidence that he plays the
Hypocrite? 3. What if it concern the whole Church that his desire be suspended?

Erastus. The first cause is not to purpose, because we speak of those De rect^
institutis ego me sem per disputa re protestatus fui.
that are well instructed. 2. The second is bred in the brain of Beza; I am
compelled to think that he that publicly professes he is grieved for his
sins, and that he purposes to live a holy life in time to come, that he
thinks as he speaks, if he remain not in that purpose: I also remain not
always in my good purpose; his desire is an Argument of Piety, which should
not be smothered and oppressed, but excited and nourished: And this opinion of
Beza depends on the Judgment of men; neither has the Lord committed the
Examination of some to Elders: And it is folly to say, It concerns the Church
to delay, to do that which the Lord has Commanded me to do.

Ans. 1. Erastus professes he stands for their admission to the Lords
Supper, who are Recte instituti, and profitentur dolere se propter peccata sua,
who are instructed in the grounds of Christian Religion, and repents of their
sins, or professes it: And he said before, as I An evident contradiction in
Erastus through his whole book. Lib. 3. c. 3. p. 206. 207.
observed it, If any shall be found who shall trample on the Sacraments, Ego
hunc minime admittendum censeo: I judge such a man should not be admitted to
the Sacraments: Whence it is clear, That Erastus professes that the ignorant
and the scandalous should be debarred from the Lords Supper: But, good Reader,
Observe that Erastus contradicts himself in all his Arguments; for he
proves, that not any one Christian in the Visible Church, ignorant, or not
ignorant; who profess their Repentance, or not profess it, can be excluded
from the Sacraments; but that all are commanded by Christ to come. But Erastus
says, Scriptura illos, de quibus nos loquimur, nec a sacrificiis arcet, nec a
sacramentis aliis ullis: Imo sub pena capitis mandat, ut universi mares, etc.
The Scripture excludes none from Sacrifices, or any other Sacraments: But
commands that all the Male Children, Jews and strangers, who are not legally
unclean, and from home, should compear at Jerusalem thrice a year before the
Lord: And page 104. In sacris literis non tantum non inveniri aliquos a
sacramentis propter solam vitae turpitudinem, ab actos esse, sed Lib. 1. c. 4.
page 112.
contrarium potius probari: And John Baptist (says he) Baptized all that came
to him, Pharisees and Sadduces, whom he affirms to be a Generation of Vipers,
Ex quo intelligimus: Whence we understand, that Ministers are not to deny the
Sacraments to those who seek them, and the Judgment is to be left to God,
Whether he who professes Repentance, dissemble, or deal truly and sincerely:
Yea, when Erastus says, That it is not in all the Scripture to be found,
Aliquos a Sacramentis propter solam vitae turpitudinem abactos esse: That any
were debarred from the Sacraments for only wickedness of life; but rather the
contrary may be proved, either ignorance of God, opposed to due instruction,
and professed impenitency, is no wickedness of life, which is most absurd; or
then in Scripture, some must be debarred Whom Erastus excludes from the
Sacraments
from the Sacraments for wickedness of life only: But Erastus says plainly,
None in Scripture are debarred from the Sacraments, for only wickedness of
life: And so they are not debarred, because they profess not Repentance. And
Erastus says, Christ said, Drink ye all of this and Judas was not excepted:
Christ went into the Temple Page 114. 115.
with most wicked men: the Pharisees and Sadduces were Baptized with the same
Baptism of John with them: Then Erastus will exclude none at all, no not
those whom Christ pronounced to sin against the Holy Ghost, and the convincing
light of their own mind, Matthew. 12. 31, 32. Ioh. 9. 39, 40, 41. and 15. 24.
and 7. 28. Yea, page 117. He Page 117.
will have none excluded in Corinth, not those that are impenitent, and those
that were partakers of the Table of Devils. Page 116. When Page 116.
Christ commands all to eat and all to drink, he excludes none that
professes themselves to be Disciples: But many profess no Repentance, Who
profess themselves Disciples: See page 117, 118. and the following pages. 2.
Erastus says, He is compelled to think, That he that publicly professes
sorrovv for sin, does think as he speaks: But to whom shall he profess it?
To the Church? Then has the Church power to accept the confession of
scandalous men, ere they be admitted to the Lords Supper: Erastus will stand at
this, for it is Government in the hands of the Church; if he must confess to
the Civil Magistrate, who made him a Steward of the Seals, and Mysteries of
the Gospel? Nor is the Church to think, as Erastus is compelled to think,
manifest Hypocrites, and those that trample the Sacraments under their feet,
will make profession of sorrow for sin: and Erastus thinks such are not to be
admitted: Page 207.
Erastus says, they may change their purpose of Repentance, and so may he do
himself. Valeat totum, granting all, that is, nothing to us, for any Divinity
we have proof of in Erastus his book* I should humbly conceive when he
speaks so ignorantly of the work of Repentance, and preparations for the
Lords Supper: he has been a man non recte institutus, not well instructed, and
Some on earth must try who are to be admitted to, or debarred from the
Sacrament, who not.
so without the lists of the disputation by his own word, and so not to have
been himself to be admitted to the Sacraments.

2. Nor is it in Beza his head only, that those who desire the Sacrament have
true piety, for Christ says, Wicked men are known by their works; otherwise if
tramplers of the Sacrament, and the ignorant desire the Sacrament, as ignorance
is neighbor to arrogance and presumption: let Erastus give us a rule in the
Word by which they are to be debarred, all his arguments will prove that they
are to be admitted: and if Erastus deny that the judgment of men either of
Church or Magistrate is to be interposed in the excluding of those who are, non
recte instituti, not rightly instructed, and do not profess sorrovv for their
sin, he must speak against sense, if he grant some must judge, who are
ignorant, and openly impenitent; then I say to Erastus what he says to Beza,
your opinion depends on the opinion and judgment of men. 3. If God have not
commanded either Elders, or any other (as Erastus says,) to examine and judge,
who are fit for the Lords Supper, who not: Then seeing Erastus says the
profane, the ignorant, the impenitently scandalous, known to be such, are to
be debarred. I ask of Erastus, to whom Christ has commanded the trial of
this, who are ignorant, and non recte instituti? Men cannot debar Page 254.
Pendet haec opinia ^ua, ex opinione and judicio hominum.
themselves from the Sacraments in a judicial way, most of men conceiting well
of themselves, rush upon the ordinances of God, not knowing that they do
evil: Workers of iniquity, who cry, Lord, Lord, Adulterers, Thieves,
Idolaters, who dare come to the Temple of the Lord and cry, The temple of the
Lord, The temple of the Lord are these, Ier. 7. 9, 10, 11. will also fast and
profess Repentance, Esa. 57. 3, 4, 5. even when their wickedness testifies to
their face against them in the eyes of all, Ier. 2. 1, etc. Ier. 2. 34. Esa. 1.
9. and they will desire ^o partake of the Lords Supper, as is evident, Esa. 57.
2. Now there are none on earth, neither Elders, or any any others to debar
them; Erastus says, Taceo jam, quod Deus Page 254.
non praecepit vel Presbyteris, vel aliis tale examen. Let Erastus answer us in
this, and by what charity is Erastus obliged to believe, all that seeks the
Lords supper, do it in truth? God has given to us men's works, not their words,
of which hypocrites are liberal, and shall we foment hypocrisy, and men's
eating their own damnation, under Erastus his pretense of encouraging, and not
suffocating seeming godly desires? Lastly, Erastus says, it does not concern
the Church, that the man defer to do that which Christ commands him to do,
this is to beg the question. Does Christ command a man to eat his own
damnation?

Quest. 9.
Other Arguments for Excommunication vindicated.

Erastus. The Apostle writes, if any man love not the Lord Jesus, Erastus li.
3. ca. 9. page 254.
let him be accursed: Ergo, Paul will have the Elders to sit and judge who
truly repent, who not, that they may admit the one to the supper, not the
other; if this be excommunication, excommunication is grounded on a thousand
places: to love Christ is to k^ep his commandments, Ioh. 13. and 15. then who
ever says those that keep not the commandments of Christ, are cursed of God,
he shall this way excommunicate: then Moses did often excommunicate. But
because the false Apostles did strive to make Paul contemptible, therefore Paul
says, God be judge which of us loves Christ, and let God destroy him who
loves him not, this is the true meaning.

Ans. Erastus perverteth the sense of Beza his words, for Beza has no such
conclusion as to prove a formal excommunication by the Elders, or Church
judicature; this is Erastus sained conclusion. Beza infers from these words,
that there is here gravissimae excommunicationis Beza de pre^byt. page 97.
species, a kind of heavy excommunication, materially, to be eternally
separated from Christ, called the great excommunication. And it was to be
accursed while the Lord come, and therefore this may prove there is a kind of
lesser excommunication, in the Church, and Moses his cursing by way of
preaching, may well inserre, that because there be Church censures, therefore
there is a Church cursing heavy, and less heavy. But Beza intends not to
prove excommunication by the Church from this, but only that Christ's enemies
are cursed, though they be other ways in the Church; and this kind of
excommunication, of shutting impenitent sinners out of heaven, is in a thousand
places of scripture, and nothing can hence be concluded against Beza; and the
like excommunication is Gal. 1. And when Ioh. 2. Ep. forbids to receive a
fa^^e teacher into your house, if he be a member of the Church, he is to be
far less kept in Christ's greater house the Church; but is to be cast out.

Erastus. When Paul says, Gal. 5. I would they were cut off who Page 255.
trouble you; he says not, conveene the Elders, and cast such men out of the
Church, or deliver them to Satan, but he wishes that they were cut off by God.

Ans. 1. The place, Gal. 5. 12. I wish they were cut off that trouble The place
Gal. 5. 12. vindicated.
you, is expounded by Piscator of cutting off from the visible Church; Yea he
says, conveene the Church, when he says, v. 9. a little leaven leaveneth the
whole lump, that is, a little false Doctrine infecteth the whole Church, and
v. 10. I am confident of you, that ye will be no otherwise minded; but he that
troubles you shall bear his judgment, who ever he be: then he hops well of
the Galathians that they will be of one mind to judge, and cast out the false
teacher, this is parallel to 1 Cor. 5. though Paul do not so right down chide
them for neglect of Church censures, as he does 1 Cor. 5.

But says Erastus, if Paul wished them to be cut off that troubled them, why
did he not cut off those false teachers, and deliver them to Satan? Erastus
answers, it was not Gods will so to do, and the Apostles Page 255. 256.
could not in every place, and at every time kill miraculously; but when it was
profitable, and necessary.

Ans. Then Paul, 1 Cor. 5. far less could rebuke the Corinthians; because
they prayed not that the incestuous Corinthian might be miraculously killed by
Paul: for Paul had not power to kill him; because it was not necessary, nor
profitable: the man repented, and was never killed. 2. Judge if it be probable
that Paul would wish to work a miracle in killing false teachers, when it was
neither profitable, necessary, nor sa^e for the Church to have them killed. 3.
Paul was confident the man who troubled them should bear his judgment.
Erastus says, it was not Gods will he should be miraculously killed; Ergo, it
was not miraculous killing, but some Church censure; or then Erastus must find
out another kind of judgment.

And why (may some say) does not Paul write to Excommunicate him, as he did the
incestuous Corinthian? Beza Answers, Paul would not 1 Cor. 5. take that
Authority to himself, but would do it by Page 97. de Presbyterio,
the suffrages of the Church: So here he shows what he desires, but happily
it was not expedient that they should be presently cut off: So Beza: Yea, the
words do well bear, that Paul thought fit, That they should bear their
Judgment who had troubled them, and that that leaven should be purged out. 2.
Yea, if this cutting off be miraculous, it is clear, Paul could not Communicate
it to others, for it was Paul's will that the incestuous Corinthian should be
delivered to Satan by the suffrages of the Corinthians: Nor do we read that the
Apostles wished to cut off men miraculously, but were not able to do it.

Erastus. It is false, That Paul willed the man to be delivered to Satan by the
suffrages of the Corinthians: For he says (...), I have already Concluded,
Ordained, Decreed, to deliver him to Satan, though I be absent in body: what
then would he have done? he would all the Church being gathered together (not
some Presbyters only) by his own spirit, and the power of the Lord Jesus
granted to him, deliver the man to Satan, that he might strike fear and terror
on others, and that the man might bear the just punishment of his wickedness.

Ans. Paul chideth them, that they were puffed up, and mourned not, that the
man might be put out of the midst of them: Then, whereas it might be said, we
want the presence of the Apostle Paul, and his privity to the business: To
this Paul says, ver. 3. (...), Paul did not judicially condemn the incestuous
man.
For me (says he) I have, as if I were present in body when you are Convened
together, etc. Judged to deliver such a one to Satan: Now that this Decree was
the judicial Decree and sentence of Paul as a miraculous Magistrate giving
sentence judicially, when Paul himself was absent, and had not convinced the
man, nor spoken with him, I do not believe; 1. Because, though (...) may
signify such a sentence of a man when the guilty is before him, yet the word
does not necessitate us to this Exposition, Luke 19. 22. Out of thy own mouth
will I judge thee; for it does as often signify a simple act of the mind, and
the opinion of any not sitting in judgment, as Act. 13. 46. Ye judge your
selves (...) unworthy of life Eternal, 1 Cor. 2. 2. I determined (...) to know
nothing but Christ, Luke 7. 43. (...), says Christ to Simon the Pharisee who
was not on the bench, Thou have judged rightly, Tit. 3. 12. I have determined
there to winter, 1 Cor. 10. 15. Judge ye what I say, Act. 27. 1. When it was
determined to sail into Italy. 2. We do not read that Apostle, Prophet or
Judge, gave out a sentence of death against any, the person condemned not being
present nor heard: the Lord himself did it not to Adam, nor to Sodom; he came
down to see, he examined Adam: Moses did not so condemn the man that gathered
sticks on the Sabbath day: Joshua convinced Achan, the Prophet convinced
Gehazi, ere he smote him with Leprosy, Peter convinced A^anias and Saphira to
their faces, ere he killed them, so did Paul convince Elimas the sorcerer in
his face, so did Christ in his miraculous purging of the Temple, convince them
that His Fathers house should be a house of Prayer. Now Paul here gives a
judicial sentence of death on a man, he never spoke of being at Philippi
whence he wrote, and the delinquent at Corinth, if we believe Erastus. 3.
Erastus judges that Paul knew this man to be penitent, and how knew Paul this?
It must be a miraculous knowledge, by which Paul at Philippi looked upon the
man's heart at Corinth, one of the greatest miracles that ever Paul wrought for
Paul had the knowledge of the man's sin only by report, v. 1. (...) it is
reported; between Paul's writing the first verse of that Chapter, and his
writing the third verse there must interveene a miraculous discovery of the
incestuous man's heart, Paul being at Philippi, and the man at Corinth; and Paul
knowing the man to be penitent, and because of his penitency (as Erastus says)
Paul did not kill him: Yet Paul so far absent, must have given out a
miraculous sentence, as a miraculous Magistrate. I (says he) by revelation as
having the sword of God now in my hand, have judged, and given out sentence,
that this man shall be miraculously killed by Satan, before your eyes, that all
may fear, and do so no more, and yet I know him to be penitent, and that he
shall not be killed by Satan; a monstrous and irrational sentence, if it be
said, that by report Paul had knowledge of his sin, and by report also he had
knowledge of his repentence, and that his spirit would be saved in the day of
the Lord, and that this knowledge came not to Paul by any immediate revelation.
I answer, Yet the sentence must stand by Erastus his mind touching (...). I
have judged and condemned him as a miraculous Magistrate to dye upon a report,
though I never heard him, and I know he shall not dye for this sault: for can
it be said, that Paul retracted a sentence which he gave out as the deputy of
God, and he even then, when he wrote the sentence, kn^w there was so much
repentance in the man, as he would for it be moved not to kill him. 4. There is
no ground in the Text, why Paul should be said to seek the naked presence of
the whole people, to do such a miracle before them, he being himself absent;
for there is more then a naked presence of the Corinthians, as only witnesses
that they might be afraid and do so no more: for they were present as
instructed with the spirit of Paul, and the power of the Lord Jesus Christ* to
deliver such a one to Satan: as the words bear, v. 4. (...). For to be
conveened in the name of Christ, being spoken, Mat. 18. v. 20. of a Church
meeting, or in reference thereunto in the same phrase, and to be conveened with
the power and spirit of Paul, and of the Lord Jesus, cannot agree to Paul; nor
can it be said, I Paul absent in body, and present in spirit, in the name of
the Lord Jesus, and with my spirit, and the power of the Lord Jesus, have
decreed to deliver such a one to Satan. For, 1. the Grammar of the words cannot
bear that, for ( being conveened in the name of the Lord, with my spirit) are
constructed together in the Text. 2. It is no sense, nor any Scripture phrase.
I present in spirit, and with my spirit have decreed to deliver such a one to
Satan. 3. It is evident that Paul would, as it were absent, recompense his
bodily absence, with the presence of the spirit, and road of Church censure,
which the Lord had communicated to them. 5. Erastus needs not object, that
there was a conveening of the Church, not of some Elders, for as there is no
word of the word Elders in the Text, so is there no word of (...) in the Text,
and so the debate will be, what is meant by (...) whether Elders, or people, or
both; but though every one in their own place were understood, yet the words
bear a juridicall convention, being conveened in the name of the Lord Jesus,
and with my spirit, and the power of the Lord Jesus.

Erastus* The questions why Paul did not command to excommunicate the false
Apostles in Galathia? Or why he did not miraculousty kill them? are both
urgent; But the latter is most urgent, for the power of miraculous afflicting
men, was given to few men, and to Apostles: But it is a wonder, if
excommunication was ever, and every where to be observed in all Churches. Yet
Paul neither practices it here, nor else where, nor commands others to
practice it; now here he desires they may be cut off, but not excommunicated.

Ans. We say the last is no question, you never read in the New Testament, or
in the Old, that Prophets or Apostles consulted, or advised with the people,
whether they should work miracles or not: 2. Though Excommunication was an
ordinary power, as the power of binding and loosing given to the Church, Matthew.
16. 19. and 18. 18. Ioh. 20. 22, 23. Yet the actual exercise of
Excommunication, being the highest and weightiest censure, and the most severe
of any other on earth, it is no wonder that Paul be as sparing and rare in the
exercise of it, as the Apostles were in killing men's bodies. 3. It is a begging
of the question, to say, Paul neither practiced himself, nor commanded others
to excommunicate, for he did both.

Erastus. That which is, Romans 16. spoken for eschewing of those Page 256. 257.
who cause offenses, is that every one single person beware of false Teachers;
it is not spoken to the Church to Excommunicate those false Teachers, and
therefore there is no such need of such a Presbytery as you dream of, but only
of good and diligent Ministers, who may rightly instruct, and prudently teach
their hearers, what Teachers they ought to eschew.

Ans. 1. The eschewing of false Teachers is a general, and a duty To eschew
the scandalous is materially to Excommunicatethem.
no question given to all and every one of the Church: But the place does no
more say in express terms that a single Pastor should give warning
particularly by name, that this man, John, Hymeneus, Alexander, are those false
Teachers to be eschewed, then it says, that the Presbytery, which we assert,
does in express terms, show what false Teachers they be, who by name are to
be Excommunicated and eschewed; but you see, that Erastus is overcome by truth,
so far, as he must say one single Minister may declare that such a false
Teacher, by name, is to be eschewed as a Heathen and a Publican, and so in
effect excommunicated, and put out of the Church; but he denies that the
Church may declare him a Heathen, as Matthew. 18. and that many Elders, (...)
gathered together in the name of Christ, as it is, 1 Cor. 5. may put out a
false Teacher, or a wolf out of the flock. 2. We grant that it is spoken to
every one, that he should eschew false teachers, yea, and 2 These. 3. All that
walks unordinately, all fornicators, extortioners, drunkards, 1 Co^. 5. But
that every man should eschew those, whom he in his private judgment conceives
to be such, before he rebuke them, and labor to gain them, and in case of
obst^n^cy, Tell the Church, as Christ commande^h, Matthew. 18. is not commanded,
bu^ forbidden, Matthew. 18. Lev. 1917. Col. 3. 15. For if this should be, that I
might immediately, upon my own private grudge, unbrother and cast out of my
heart and entire fellowship, every one whom I conceive offends me, and
walks unordinately, without observing Christ's order, or previous rebuking of
him, I make a pathway to perpetual Schisms: 2. A violation of all Laws of
fraternity, and Christian Communion. 3. A diss^lving and breaking of all Church
Communion, and i^ were strange, if Erastus will have Christ's order kept, Matthew.
18. in private offenses done by one brother to another, and not in public
offenses, when a brother offends twenty, and a whole Church, as if I were
obliged to seek to gain my brothers soul in private and l^sse injuries, and not
in public, and more heinous offenses.

Hence it is clear to me, If we are to reject an Heretic, after once, Tit. 3.
10. Ioh 2. 10.
or twice admonition, and not to receive in our houses false Teachers, and 1 Timothy 6. 3. If any teach otherwise, and consent not unto the wholesome word,
even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, being given to perverse disputing, as
men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, 1 Timothy 6. 3, 4, 5. We are to
withdraw our selves from such, and to save, with severity and plucking out of
the fi^e, those that cannot be cured; then certainly the Church of Christ must
also turn away from such men, and acknowledge them as no members of the body,
whereof Christ is the head; if we say not this, if one has leave in a
constituted Church, to j^dge and condemn his brother, and then we shall not
take the course of the Apostles in the like case, as Act. 15. which is not
Apostolic, for when false Teachers troubled the Brethren, they would not
peremptorily, though great Apostles, as Paul and Barnabas, determine against
either the false doctrine, or the persons of the Teachers, while the Apostles,
Elders, and Brethren did meet in a Synod, and determine against the Error, and
against the men, as such as troubled the Brethren with words, and perverted
their souls, Act. 15. Now Erastus is willing to acknowledge a sort of Divine
Excommunication, not a humane, as he is pleased to call that Ordinance of
separating of wicked men from the Church and holy things of God, which yet was
in the Church of the Jews, instituted by Christ and his Apostles, and which no
Church wanted, as learned Beza says, even in the time of persecution: had
Erastus explained to us his divine Excommunication, as he calls it, it were
easy to bring most of his own Arguments with greater strength of reason
against it then against ours, which is the truly divine Excommunication.

CHAP. XIV.
Quest. 10.
Whether Erastus does strongly prove that there is no Presbytery, nor two
distinct judicatures, one of the Church, another of the State?

Erastus. I deny not, First, such a Presbytery, as the Evangelists Erastusl. 4.
c. 1. c. 2. p. 258. 259. What Presbyteries Erastus yeildeth.
mention, which is called a Presbytery, a Synedry, a Synagogue; this was the
civil Magistrate who had amongst the Jews the power of the sword. 2. I deny
not a Presbytery, 1 Cor. 6. when the Church wants a civil Magistrate. 3. I
deny not a Presbytery of learned men, who being asked, may give their judgment
of doubts: of which Ambrose, there was nothing of old done sine seniorum
consilio, without the Counsels of the Elders. But I deny a Senate, collected
out of the body of the Church, to judge who repents, and are to be
excommunicated, and debarred from the Sacraments, and who not; or I deny any
Ecclesiastical judicature, touching the manners and conversation of men,
different from the judgment or court of the civil Magistrate, or that there
be two supreme Courts touching manners in one Common wealth.

Ans. One simple head in a moment, may deny more then many wise men can prove
in a whole day, it proves they are more cumbersome in their disputes, then
strong; that there was a Jewish Presbytery, that is, a civil judicature, is
con^uted by Lev. 10. 10. where there is a Court of Aarons sons, whose it was
to judge of Church matters only, and to put difference between holy, and
unholy, between clean, and unclean. 2. A Presbytery of arbitrators in
matters civil, to keep Christians from going to law one with another, before
heathen judges: Is not a Presbytery, 1 Cor. 6. one wise man might do that, and
he is no Presbytery. 2. There is no judicatures of Officers there; they were
but gifted men arbitrarily chosen for a certain business, and were not
judges, habitu. 3. A Presbytery for Doctrine only is further to seek in the
word, I hope, then our Presbytery; Erastus should teach us where it is. 4. He
denies a Presbytery for manners, then all scandals must come before the civil
Magistrate. Who made him a Church officer to judge of the affairs of the
Church? Who is to be admitted to the seals, who not? For two supreme Courts, I
shall speak God-willing.

Erastus. There is no College of Presbyters at Corinth, but every Page 259.
man was to judge himself.

Ans. There is a company gathered together in the name of our A Presbytery at
Corinth.
Lord Jesus with the spirit of Paul, and the power of our Lord Jesus, 1 Cor. 5.
4. 5. who did judge those that are within, and put out from amongst them an
incestuous man, v. 12, 13. least he should leaven the whole Church, v. 6. this
is a College of judges. 2. There is a number of builders and laborers with
God, 1 Cor. 3. 9, 10, 11, 12. Ministers of God, dispensers of the mysteries of
Word and Sacraments of God, 1 Cor. 4. 1. such as Paul, Apollos, Cephas, and
others, 1 Cor. 1. 12, 13. 1 Cor. 4. 6. A number that had power to punish, to
forgive, 2 Cor. 1. 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 3. A number of Prophets who judged of the
Doctrine of the Prophets, 1 Cor. 14. 30, 31, 32. these be very like a College
of Presbyters. O but Paul writes not to those, but to those who were puffed
up, and mourned not, 1 Cor. 5. 2. These were the people and Church. Ans. Yea
these were the eyes, ears, and principal parts of the Church, 1 Cor. 12. 14,
15, 16, 17, 18. now he writes to the Church, 1 Cor. 1. 1* 2.

Erastus. Before this time, Paul must have instituted this Presbytery, who
sees not that this is false? for so he would have accused the Presbytery, not
the whole Church; but he accuses not the Elders, because they admitted the man
to the Lords supper, and there is no word of excommunication here. There is no
mention of one judgment, of one election, of one office, but he chideth the
whole Church; because they mourned not: it was not the Elders office to remove
this; they dream, who say there is a Presbytery instituted here, and there was
none instituted before this Epistle was written; he bids them not ask
suffrages, whether he should be excommunicated or no.

Ans. All that Erastus says against a Presbytery, is to improve
excommunication: But there may be excommunication by the people, as many hold,
where there be no Elders at all. 2. Let Erastus point out the time, when a
number of preaching Prophets were instituted at Corinth, whether in this
Chapter (which to me is a dream) or before. 3. He had cause to rebuke all; All
were secure, the Elders who cast him not out, the people who said not to their
Elders, as the Colossians are bidden say, Col. 4. 17. to Archippus; and will
Erastus say that preaching Elders, who by office, are the eyes of the Church, 1
Cor. 12. 17, 28. were not to be chief in mourning to God, and praying that the
man might be miraculously killed? and yet he reproves all equally. 4. He
reproves them all that the man was not cast out of the Church, and this
includes a reproof, that he enjoyed all the Church privileges, especially
the Sacraments. 5. It is false that there is no mention of judgment, v. 12. Do
not ye judge those that are within? for election, there is none in the Chapter,
nor any Presbytery instituted in this Chapter; it was before: Erastus has the
like reason to say, that there was no instituted Church at Corinth, because in
the 1. or 2. Epistle to the Corinthians: we read not where he instituted any
such Church; if we find the thing instituted, we know it had an institution,
and let Erastus show us when Paul received the institution of the Lords supper,
from the Lord: shall we deny he received any such thing contrary to 1 Cor. 11.
23. because we find not where and how he received from the Lord? 6. There is
no asking of suffrages mentioned Act. 1. at the choosing of Mathias, nor Act.
6. at the choosing of the Deacons that we read of; Ergo, there were no
suffrages there; it follows not. 7. And ought not far rather suffrages to
have been asked before the people should take on their heads the man's blood, by
consenting thereunto, and praying for it, as Erastus says?

Erastus. If these words, v. 3. I verily as absent in body, but present in
spirit, have decreed, etc. signify, choose out of your company, Presbyters,
who are to censure the manners of the people, who shall debar the unworthy
from the Sacraments, I am willing to suffer any thing.

Ans. I know no man but Erastus that dreameth of any such sense, there is no
institution of a Presbytery in this Chapter, no calling of Ministers; but it
presupposes a ministry before s^^led. But if th^se words. I have decreed,
etc. have the Erastian sense, I have given s^^^e^c^ as a Magistrate, that the
man be killed by the ministry of the Devil; and that you shall be my Heralds
to proclaim this sentence: it is a wonder the Text give not any hint of such a
sense.

Erastus. v. 12. he speaks not of the judgment of Presbyters, Page 261.
but of all the people.

Ans. 1. This Erastus on his word asserteth, without probation: Erastus
grants an examination of such as are to be admitted to the Sacraments, but
denies all exclusion. Page 261.
We deny it, it is but par^llel with Gods judging. 2. It is an act of the keys.
3. It is relative to casting out by those that are conveened in the name of the
Lord Jesus, with the spirit of Paul, and the power of our Lord Jesus: Was every
Girl, and believing servant capable of this spirit* and power?

Erastus. I grant before any come to age, be baptized, he is to be examined,
whether he understand the Doctrine of says, and assent to it with his heart: I
grant it is profitable that young ones be examined, before they be admitted to
the supper, but I deny God has for either of those instituted a Presbytery.
But there is no ground that a Presbytery must try wicked men, ere they be
admitted to the Lords supper.

Ans. 1. We owe Erastus thanks for granting this; but what if the aged be sound
grossly ignorant, and incapable of the seals? and some wicked men will trample
the seals as swine, and yet they desire the seals. Erastus said before, such
should not be admitted; who Page 207.
should debar them; either the Church of believers, or those that are over
them in the Lord, or the Magistrate must debar them: if the first and second
be said, Erastus comes to find some use for a Presbytery; if the Magistrate
be an heathen, he cannot examine or debar any from the seals. Let Erastus
answer, if he be a Christian, how can it be denied; but if the Magistrate by
his office is to steward the bread to one of the children, not to another, but
he is a steward to cut and divide the word, and seals both aright; and how
could Paul make it one of the properties of the Pastor, 2. Tim. 2. to cut the
word, and by the same reason to distribute the seals aright, if it depend upon
another officer by his office to command him to divide it to this man, whom he
has examined, and finds in his mind qualified, and not to this man? We judge
the Elders of the New Testament do agree in this common and perpetual
morality, that both are to put difference between clean, and unclean, holy, and
unholy, though many things were unclean to the Jews, that are not unclean to
us, and that the Church has yet a power to bind and loose, Mat. 16. 9.

Erastus. There was never a wiser common wealth in the world, Page 262. lib. 4.
then that of the Jews, Deuteronomy. 4 But in the Common wealth of the Jews, there
were never two distinct judicatures concerning manners: Ergo, There should
not be these two different jurisdictions in the Christian common wealth. But
all should be given to the civil Magistrate.

Ans. Erastus is seldom happy in his Logic, his Sy^logismes are thin sown,
all Gods laws are most wise, but if this be a good Argument, was not their
Church, their Religion, their Ceremonies, their judicial Laws, all wise and
righteous? Then the Christian Church should be conform yet to the Jewish, we
should have those same bloody sacrifices, judicial laws, Ceremonies that they
had. The Iudicatures and officers are positive things, flowing from the
positive will of God, who does appoint one jurisdiction for them, most wise,
and another to Christians different from them, and in its kind, most wise. 2.
We give two judicatures in the Church of the Jews, concerning manners, one
civil, acknowledged by Erastus; another spiritual and Ecclesiastic, ordaining
Ecclesiastic and Spiritual punishments upon the unclean, Lev. 10. 10. As to
be removed out of the camp, and such like, and Deuteronomy. 17. Thou shall come to
the priests, the Levites, and the Judge, that shall be in those days,
according to the sentence which they of that place (which the Lord shall
choose) The places Deuteronomy. 17. and 2 Chronicles. ^9 do prove two different judicatures.
shall show thee, and thou shall observe to do according to all that they
inform thee, ver. 12. And the man that will do^ presumptuously, and will not
hearken (...) to the Priest, (that stands there to minister before the Lord
thy God) or unto the judge, (...) even that man shall die, and thou shall put
avvdy evil from Israel. There is here an evident disjunction that clearly
holds forth, that both the Priests and the civil judge judged in matters of
manners, and that he that presumptuously despised the sentence of either was to
die: a judicature of the Priests is evidently here, and a judicature of the
civil judge, Erastus cannot deny, and that the Priest judged in subordination
to the civil judge, is refuted by the words, which says the Priest was
immediately subordinate to God, not to the Magstistrate: He that will not hear
the Priest ( that stands to minister before the Lord thy God) shall die:
Ergo, He is the Minister of the Lord; and God called and separated Aaron and
his sons, to stand before the Lord, and to minister, and he did call the
Levites, the Magistrate called them not to office.

Erastus. Beza says, that Moses, Joshua, David, Solomon, did not Page 262.
execute the office of the Priests, and therefore the charge of the Priests,
and of the civil Magistrates were different offices, and charges; but I said,
before the Lord chose Aaron and his sons to be Priests, they were not so
distinct charges, but they did agree to one and the same person; for, Moses to
omit the rest, did execute the office of Aaron, Levit. 8. But after that it was
not lawful for any to do the office both of King and Priest; and therefore
Saul and Vzziah were justly corrected of God for it. But what is this? It
proves not that the Priests had public judicatures to punish wickedness of
manners.

Ans. Certainly, if Erastus deny the charge of the Priest and the How the
Kingly and priestly office are different.
King to be different offices, because once Moses did offer Sacrifice, (and so
was Melchisedeck both a King and a Priest, Heb. 7.) he must say that Moses
offered Sacrifices, Levit. 8. not as a Priest. (Sure I am, Moses was a Prophet,
and a Prince and Ruler, but no Priest.) But Moses by Erastus his way, must as a
civil Magistrate have offered Sacrifices, and not as a Priest or privileged
person by a special and an extraordinary commandment of God; for to deny the
two offices of Priest and King to be different offices, because one man
discharged some Acts proper to both Offices, as Moses both did bear the Sword
of God, as a Prince, and did also discharge some Acts proper to the Priest, as
Erastus says he did, Leviticus 8. is a poor and naughty Argument: undeniable
it is that Melchisedeck was both King and Priest, but even then to be a King
and to be a Priest, were two distinct offices, in nature and essence, because
Melchisedech did not take away the life of a Murderer, as a Priest, but as
King of Salem, Heb. 7. 1. Nor did Abraham pay tithes to Melchisedech as to a
King, but as to a Priest. Tithes in Moses Law as tithes, were never due to any
but to the Priests: and therefore even in Melchisedeck, the Kingly and Priestly
office, were formally distinct Ordinances of God, just as David as a King and
judge took away the head of the man who brought Saul's head to him, and not as a
Prophet he did this; so as a Prophet he penned the Psalms, not as a King: If
one and the same man be both a Musician and a painter, he does paint
excellently as a painter, not at a Musician, and he sings excellently not as
a Painter, but as a Musician; and though one and the same man do acts proper
to both, that may prove that Music and the art of painting are one
subjectively only, that they may both agree to one and the same man, but not
that they are not two faculties and gifts of God different in spece and nature.
2. Though Erastus confess that it was unlawful that Vzzias and Saul should
sacrifice, yet he will have the Kings office, and the Ministers office under
the New Testament not so different; for Lib. 3. c. 1. page 175. Erastus denies
the Ministry to be a peculiar ordinance to some only, but common to all under
the New Testament.
he said expressly, Who knows not now when Aarons Priesthood is removed, but
we are all equally Priests? Saul and Vzziah sinned when they were bold to
sacrifice and burn incense, but the Magistrate does not therefore sin, who
exercises the charge of the Ministry, if he might for his business perform
both, does Paul make exceptions of Magistrates and Potentates, when he says, 1
Cor. 14. You may all prophecy? Hence he must grant that the civil Magistrate
now may both preach, baptize, and administer the Supper of the Lord, and
therefore not only has the Church no Senate, nor Ecclesiastical court to
punish faults, and scandals with Ecclesiastic censures; but there is no
Presbytery of Elders to give their judgment in matters of doctrine, for the
Magistrates and all Christians may as well prophecy by ^ Cor. 14. as Ministers,
says he, yea the faculty of preaching is no more proper to the Ministers of
the Church, then to the Magistrates of the city. Now by this nothing is proper
to the Magistrate, as the Magistrate, but to the Magistrate as a Christian, and
to all Christians. But Erastus contendeth that the government of the Church,
and punishing of Scandals, which we say belongs to those that are over the
people of God in the Lord, and to Church Rulers, does belong to the Magistrate
as the Magistrate, and virtute officii, by virtue of his office: so that if any
Jew or Turk, or any ignorant or extremely scandalous should attempt to
intrude himself upon the Seals, the Magistrate as the Magistrate and virtute
officii, is to examine and judge if he be unworthy, and to debar him, or as he
finds him worthy, admit him to the Seals. Now any sees that it is but a
deceiving of the Reader, to say that one man may discharge both the place of
the Magistrate, and the Minister of God, as Moses did, and Joshua, and David:
For let Erastus and his followers show us roundly and downright, whether or no
prophesying, debarring the unworthy from the Seals, and all acts of Church
government, not proper to the Magistrate as the Magistrate, and virtute
officii; And if so, (as indeed Erastus teaches) it is bu^ a poor shift to
say, that one and the same man may both exercise the part of a Magistrate, and
of a Minister.

Erastus. Beza for ever shall not prove that there was a Church judicature,
that had power to punish scandalous men. Iehoshaphat Page 263. 264. Two
distinct Iudicatures, 2 Chronicles. 19.
2 Chronicles. 19. ordained judges in all the fenced cities, and admonished them of
their duty. 2. And did the same at Jerusalem. 3. And ordained judges of Levites
and Priests, and heads of families, for the judgment of the Lord, and for
every cause; and Amaziah the High Priest was chief in the causes of the Lord,
and Zebadiah in the Kings causes. This Synedrie at Jerusalem was the politic
Magistrate, they judged of strokes, servitude, deaths. But your Synedrie
judges not between blood and blood, it judges not of every cause, as Deuteronomy.
17. Those that are not well versed in Scripture, are to note two things: 1.
That the cause of the Lord, where mention is made of judicatures, is not only
a cause of Religion, but any cause proposed in judgment, especially the causes
of the widow, the Orphan, and oppressed, which the Lord says he will avenge.
2. The Levites and Priests were no less civil judges then others it is known
that only the Levits were Magistrates in the cities of refuge, there was need
of men exercised in the Law of God, that the judges might judge righteously.

Ans. If you take punishing for inflicting Church-censure, (as we here take it)
then all the places that says the Priests pronounced the Leper clean or
unclean, to put out of the camp, or take in, to judge of the adulterous woman,
of the restitution made by those for whom they offered Sacrifices, to judge
between the clean and unclean; to hold out of the Sanctuary the unclean, the
uncircumcised in heart and flesh, Levit. 13. 3, 4, etc. and 20, 22. and 21. 26,
and 30. 44. and 31. 50. Ezekiel. 22. 26. and 44. 8, 9, 10. Number. 3. 6, and 5. 18,
19. Deuteronomy, 17. 12. say the Priests had power to punish for transgressing of Gods
Laws, and where the Prophets complain of the Priests mis-government and
unjustice, it is presupposed they were to govern justly according to the Law,
Ier. 5. 31. 2 King. 12. 4. Ier. 26. 7, 8, 11. Hag. 2. 11, 12. Ezekiel. 44. 8, 9,
10. 2. For the place 2 Chronicles. 19. it is evident that Iehoshaphat does reform
both Church and State, and brought the corrupted Iudicatures to that which they
should be by Law; and v. 5, 6, 7. He set judges in the fenced cities of Judah:
Here is the civil judicature. And v. 8. Moreover in Jerusalem did Iehoshaphat
set of the Levits, and of the Priests, and of the chiefo of the fathers of
Israel, for the judgment of the Lord, and for controversies, when they
returned to Jerusalem. Now that this second is a Church judicature, I am
confirmed, 1. Because Iehoshaphat appointed civil judges in all the fenced
cities of Judah; Ergo, Also in Jerusalem the prime fenced city: Now this civil
judicature was not tied to a place, but was in every city, even all the fenced
cities; but the Synedrie of Priests, Levites and Elders was only at Jerusalem,
in the place that the Lord should choose, Deuteronomy. 17. 8. Hence a judicature tied
to no city, but which is in every fenced city, 2 Chronicles. 19. 5. Deuteronomy. 17. 8. and
a judicature tied to Jerusalem, the place that the Lord did choose, Deuteronomy. 17.
8. 2 Chronicles. 19. 8. must be two distinct judicatures, but such were these. 2.
There is a ( moreover) put to the Judicature at Jerusalem, (...) and also in
Jerusalem did Iehoshaphat set of the Levites, etc. This could not have been
said, if this had not been a judicature different from the former, for if
Iehoshaphat appointed Judges in all the fenced cities; Ergo, He appointed them
first at Jerusalem, the Mother city and fountain of justice; now then he
should say the same thing needlessly, and with a moreover, if this judicature at
Jerusalem were not a judicature Ecclesiasticke and different from the
judicature civil, that he appointed at Jerusalem as one of the prime fenced
cities, which was common with the civil judicatures in other fenced cities. 3.
The persons in the judicatures are different, for v. 5. the members of the
court, 2 Chro. 19. 5, 6, 7* are called (...) judges; these could not be
Churchmen, for of these he speaks v. 8. and they are expressly distinguished
from the Levites, Priests and Elders, v. 8. who are all Churchmen, for the
fathers of the people were no other thing then our governing Elders, and these
were members of the other court, v. 8. 4. The objects of these judicatures are
very different. The Spirit of God says of the one ver. 5. That they judge for
the Lord, ver. 13. for* (...)
all the Kings matters, this must be all civil causes, in which the King, and
inferior judges under the King do judge; but the object of the other is
higher. The Priests and Levites are appointed by Iehoshaphat for the judgment
of the Lord, ver. 8. And in every matter of the Lord, v. 13. Now whereas
Erastus puts a note of ignorance on all that has been versed in the Old
Testament before him, whereas he confesses he understands not the Original
Language, let the Reader judge what arrogance is here, where ever there is
mention (says he) of judgment, there is signified not religious causes, but
also other causes, especially the cause of the widow and Orphane: It bewrays
great ignorance. For, 1. The matters of the Lord, and the matters of the King,
are so evidently distinguished, and opposed the one to the other, by two diverse
presidents in the different judicatures, the one Ecclesiastical, Amaziah the
chief Priest, in every word or matter of the Lord* and the other Zebadiah, the
son of Ishmael the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the Kings matters,
that the very words of the Text, say that of Erastus which he says of others,
that he is not versed in the Scripture: for then the causes of the Lord, and
the causes of the King in the Text, by Erastus should be the same causes,
whereas the Spirit of God does distinguish them most evidently. 2. If the cause
of the King, were all one with the judgment of the Lord, and the cause of the
Lord, yea, if it were all one with all causes whatsoever either civil or
Ecclesiastical, what reason was there they should be distinguished in the
Text? and that Amaziah should not be over the people in the Kings matters,
though he were the chief Priest, and Zebadiah though a civil Judge over all
the matters of the Lord, and causes Ecclesiastical? 3. The Kings matters are
the causes of the widow, and orphan, and oppressed, as is evident, Ier. 22. 2.
O King of Judah, v. 3. execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver
the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, and do no wrong, do no violence
to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, so Esa. 1. 10. 17. Prove. 31.
4, 5. Job 29. 12, 13, etc. Then the* Text must bear that every matter of the
King is the Judgment of the Lord, and the matter of the Lord; and every matter
and judgment of the Lord, is also the matter of the King, and to be judged by
the King, then must the King as well as the Priest, judge between the clean and
the unclean, and give sentence who shall be put out of the Camp, and not enter
into the Congregation of the Lord, no less then the Priests. Let Erastus and
all his see to this, and then must the Priests also releeve the fatherless and
widow, and put to death the oppressor. 2. The different presidents in the
judicatures makes them different judicatures. 3. It is denied, that all causes
whatsoever came before the Ecclesiastical Synedry at Jerusalem, Erastus does
say this, but not prove it; for the place 2 Chronicles. 19. does clearly expound the
place, Deuteronomy. 17. for the causes of the brethren that dwell in the Cities,
between Blood and Blood, between Law and Commandment, Statutes and judgments
are judged in the Ecclesiastical Synedrim at Jerusalem not in a civil
coactive way by the power of the sword. 1. Because all causes are by a coactive
power judged, as the matters of the King, the supreme sword bearer, 2 Chronicles.
19. 5. v. 13. Romans 13* 4. to eschew oppression, and maintain justice, Ier. 22.
2, 3. But the causes here judged in this Synedrim, are judged in another
reduplication, as the matters of the Lord differenced from the matters of the
King, 2 Chronicles. 19. 13. now if the Priests and Levites judged in the same
judicature, these same civil causes, and the same way by the power of the
sword, as Magistrates, (as Erastus says) why is there in the Text, 1. Two
judicatures; one, v. 5. in all the fenced cities; another at Jerusalem, v. 8?
2. What means this, that the Kings matters are judged in the civil
judicature, not by the Priests and Levites? (as Erastus says) for the Ruler of
the house of Judah was president in these, and the matters of the Lord were
judged by the Priests and Levites? and Amariah the chief Priest was over them?
for then Amariah was as well over the Kings matters, as the Ruler of the house
of Judah, and the Ruler of the house of Judah over the Lords matters, as over
the Kings; for if Priests and Levites judged as the Deputies subordinate to the
King, and by the power of the sword, the Kings matters are the Lords matters,
and the Lords matters the Kings matters, and Amariah judges not as chief
Priests, as he does burn incense, but as an other judge, this truly is to
turn the Text upside down. 2. The causes judged in the Synedrim at Jerusalem,
are said to be judged as controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem, 2 Chr.
19. 8. and matters too hard, between plea and plea, between blood, and blood,
between stroke and stroke, Deuteronomy. 17. 8. and so doubts of Law, and cases of
conscience. Now Mal. 2. 7. The Priests lips should preserve knowledge, and they
should seek the Law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of
hosts, and this way only the Priests and Levites judged, not that they
inflicted death on any; but they resolved in an Ecclesiastical way, the
consciences of the judges of the fenced Cities, what was a breach of the Law of
God Moral or Judicial, what not; what deserved Church censures, what not, who
were clean, who unclean; and all these are called the judgment of the Lord,
the matters of the Lord; because they had so near relation to the soul and
conscience, as the conscience is under a divine Law. 3. Erastus says, it is
known that the Levites only were Magistrates in the Cities of refuge, but I
deny it; Erastus should have made it known to us from some Scripture: I find
no ground for it in Scripture.

Erastus. It is true, that Beza says, that the Magistrate has a Page 265.
supreme power to cause every man do his duty. But how has he that supreme
power, if he be also subject to the Presbyters? for your Presbyters do subject
the Magistrate to them, and compel him to obey them and punish them, if they
disobey.

Ans. The Magistrate even King David leaves not off to be supreme, because
Nathan commands him in the Lord; nor the King of Niniveh and his Nobles leave
not off to command as Magistrates, though Jonah by the word of the Lord bring
them to lie in sackcloth, and to Fast; all the Kings are subject to the rebukes
and threatenings of the Prophets, Isa. 1. 10. Jer. 22. 2, 3. Ier. 1. 18. 2 Kin.
12. 8, 9. 10, 11, 12. 1 Kin. 21. 21, 22, 23. Isa. 30. 33. Hos. 5. 1, 2. and to
their commandments in the Lord: If Presbyters do command as Ministers of
Christ, the highest powers on earth if they have souls, must submit their
consciences to the Lords rebukings, threatenings and Commandment in their mouth:
Court Sycophants say the contrary, but we care not. 2. But they punish the
Christian Magistrate (says he) if there be any Church Censure, as we suppose
there is, this Objection should not have been made against us; because of the
Magistrates supremacy; it does conclude with equal strength, that Pastors
should use it against no man: Now there be some swine that trample the
Sacraments, some not well instructed in the grounds of Christian Religion* and
Erastus said, page 207. Such should not be admitted to the Lords Supper* Now
the Magistrate the King is such; Let Erastians say, the Pearls of the Seals of
the Covenant are to be given to no swine, except the swine be Magistrates, and
that which the Church binds on earth is bound in heaven, except it be the
Magistrate; Erastus says, he may go to Hell by privilege of his place; and
that whose sins the Elders of the Church retains are retained, except it be
the Kings sins, and that we are to put shame upon scandalous persons, and to
refuse to eat with them, Romans 16. 17. 2* These. 3. 14, 15. 1 Cor. 5. 11. 2
Ioh. 10. Except they be Magistrates; Sure God is no accepter of persons.

Erastus. Whereas you say, it is not lawful for the Magistrate to Page 265.
preach and administer the Sacraments* (if he might because of his business be
able to discharge both Offices) it is not true: God has not forbidden it; it
was lawful in the Old Testament, for one man to discharge both, why is it not
lawful now also? the history of Eli and Samuel is known; it is nothing that
you say, that the tribunal of Moses, was distinguished from the tribunal of
Aaron: for God gave to Aaron no tribunal at all, different from the tribunal
of Moses, he never did forbid the Priests to sit in the Civil judicature after
the captivity, the Priests judged the people Ezech. 44.

Ans. That it is lawful for the Magistrate to preach and Administer
Magistrates are not to dispense the word and Sacraments as Erastus says.
the Sacraments, 1. Destroys the Ordinance of Pastors, and a sent and called
Ministry under the New Testament, against the Scriptures, Heb* 5. 4* No man
takes on him this honor to himself* except he that is called of God, as was
Aaron: So also Christ glorified not himself, to be made an high Priest, etc. ^
2. God often makes an honor of a calling to the Ministry, that he has
separated them to it, Numb. 16* 9. Moses says to Korah; hear now ^e sons of
Levi, Seems it a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel has separated
you from the congregation of Israel to bring you near to himself to do the
service of the tabernacle of the Lord, Deuteronomy. 10. 8. At that time the Lord
separated the tribe of Levi to bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, to
stand before the Lord to minister unto him, Numb. 8* 6. 7. 8. 9. But that same
honor is put upon the Preachers of the Gospel, Rom* ^. 1. Paul the servant of
Jesus Christ, called to be an Apostle, separated unto the Gospel of God, Act.
13. 2. The holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work
whereunto I have called them: If it be an honor, and no man, though gifted as
Christ was, can take honor to himself: No Magistrate can take on him to
discharge the office of a Minister.

Object. But when he is called to be a Magistrate, he is called to be a
Minister, and so being called to the one, he is called by the same calling to
the other.

Ans. If being called to be Magistrate, he be also called to be a Minister,
then being called to be a Minister, he is called to be a Magistrate, and Hoc
ipso that he is a Minister, be may usurp the sword, and usurp the Throne and
the Bench* But Christ being sent to be a Prophet, and to preach the Gospel,
Esa. 61. 1. Luke 4. 20. 21. ve^. 43. refused to divide the inheritance, and to
be a a Judge, Luke 12. 13, 14. He would not take on him to be a judge, except
God had made him, and called him to be a judge; If any say the Magistrate,
being the supreme place, contains eminently all inferior offices* as to be a
Minister, a Lawyer, a Physician, etc. but the inferior does not contain the
superior, I Ans. Then the Magistrate being called to be a Magistrate and King,
he is called to be a Priest to burn incense, which the Lord condemned in his
word* in Vzzah; then when Saul is called to be a King, he is called to be an
Astronomer, Lawyer, Physician, Sayler, Tailor: Now God gives a spirit to be a
King, but no gifts to those offices; Ergo, No calling thereunto, for no gifts
argue no calling of God. 2. If a man called to be a judge, be also by that same
calling, by which he is made a judge, made a Minister, then it is all one to be
called to be a judge, and to be a Minister; and so a Magistrate as a Magistrate
does preach and administrate the Sacraments, then 1. All Magistrates should
preach and administrate the Sacraments, and Nero, and heathen Magistrates are
gifts, actu primo, given by Christ ascending on high, for the edifying the body
of the Church, Ephe. 4. 11, 12.

Obj. It is not sin to him to preach and administrate the Sacraments; but
then he cannot have time for both.

Ans. If God lawfully call the Magistrate to preach the Gospel, woe be to him,
if he preach not, he should lay aside all other employments and preach, God
never gave a talent and calling to any to preach, but he ought to lay aside
other things, and employ that talent to the honor of God, otherwise he sins
in digging his Lords talent in the earth, whereas he is obliged to make five
talent ten. 2. If he preach as a Pastor not as a Magistrate, then he has
another calling of God to be a Pastor, and another to be a Magistrate, and
^^rtaine it is, as a Magistrate he does not preach; because there be far
other qualifications required in a Magistrate, as Deuteronomy. 1. 12. that he be wise,
and understanding, and known, and a man of truth, hating coveteousnesse, Exo.
18. 21. But there is far other qualities required in a Bishop, 1 Timothy 3. 1,
2, 3. Ergo, it is one thing to be called to be a Minister, and another to be
called to be a Magistrate. 3. In all the word, Christ never commanded the
Magistrate to preach and baptize* this negative Argument Erastus uses often
against us, to prove that none ought to be excluded from the Sacraments,
because Priests, Prophets, Christ, Apostles never excluded any: But Christ
commanded the Ministers to preach and baptize, and gave them the Holy Ghost for
that effect, and sent them as the father sent him, as having received all power
from the father, Math. 28. 18, 19, 20. Mark. 16. 15, 16. Ioh. 20. 20, 21, 22.
and least we should think this charge was given to Apostles as Apostles, he
teaches that it is given to all faithful Pastors to the end of the world,
Math. 28. v. 20. Lo I am with you, even unto the end of the world, Amen. Not to
say, that if it be peculiar to Apostles to preach and baptize, neither Pastors,
far less Magistrates can do it, or then Pastors and Magistrates are Apostles
sent to preach to all the world, and can work miracles, which is absurd. 4.
Christ ascending to heaven, left Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers,
for the perfecting of the Saints, and work of the Ministry; not Kings and
Magistrates. 5. How shall they preach, except they be sent? Magistrates as
Magistrates bear the sword, and have carnal weapons, and are not sent; the
weapons of Ministers are not carnal, 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5. For Erastus his
Argument, God has not forbidden Magistrates to preach; Ergo, it is lawful for
them to preach, it follows not* for such positive ordinances as preaching
Ministers, must be appointed by a positive command, for where has God
forbidden women to baptize? Ergo, they may baptize; is not the Lords commanding
the Apostles to go teach and baptize all Nations, and his not giving any such
commandment to others, as good as a forbidding of them? But I hope this is
examined already suffi^ientl^. 2. For Samuel his being both Judge and Prophet,
I grant it; but as an extraordinary dispensation of God, which Christ would not
take on him to do, Luke 12. nor is it left to us as a rule. 3. That Aarons sons
had no tribunal of their own different from the tribunal of Moses, is proved
to be false from 2 Chr. 19, 8. 4. That the Priests were Magistrates having the
power of the sword, cannot be proved by any word of God, the pl^^e Ez^. 44. is
every way for us, all the power given in that Cha* is Ecclesiastical, none
Civil, as to k^ep the charge of the Lords holy things, to exclude the
uncircumcised in heart and flesh, out of the sanctuary, to come near to the
table of the Lord and Minister, v. 16, to enter into the gates of the inner
courts, clothed in linen, etc. and many the like, did no more agree to a
Magistrate then to burn incense, which to do, Erastus grants was unlawful in
King Vzziah; yet he would prove that it is lawful under the New Testament to
exercise both, so the Magistrate were able to do both; because Samuel exercised
both. But might not King Vzziah exercise both without impeachment of his
business? and where was he forbidden? but in this God made choice of the tribe
of Levi, and of no others, which also he has done under the New Testament* as
is proved.

Erastus. Nor is that true, that whose part it is to preach and dispense The
Magistrate is not to judge who are to be admitted to the Sacraments, who not.
the Sacraments, it is his part to judge of those that prophaneth the word, and
seals, so as he has power to punish any that desires the Sacraments, with the
want of the Sacraments; and though it were true, it should prove that Pastors,
not a Presbytery of Pastors and Ruling Elders have any power to debar from
the seals.

Ans. 1. Well, then Erastus grants that the Ministers are to preach the Word
and dispense the Sacraments: But not to judge of those that profane the holy
things of God, nor to debar from the Sacraments any who desire them; if
Erastus did mean a bodily debarring by the power of the sword, if any openly
profane shall violently intrude himself, we should yield that to the
Magistrate as the keeper of both Tables. But Erastus is of that mind, that as
the Magistrate may preach and dispense the Sacraments, he may by that power
also Ecclesiastically cognosce, and judge of the scandals, for which the openly
profane are to be debarred, and accordingly debar. Now Erastus says he may
preach as a Christian, because that all Christians now under the New Testament
may preach and prophecy, all are Priests and Prophets, so says he, page 175.
So the Magistrate by this as a Christian, and L. 3. c. 1. ex equo n^s omnes
esse sacerdotes.
so all Christians women and children, may try and examine all that are openly
profane, and unworthy of the Seals: this can be nothing but popular Anarchy;
yet that the Magistrate, as a Magistrate, and not as a Christian, is to examine
and try who are unworthy communicants, I conceive is the mind of Erastus, as I
have proved before: Which though it be a plain contradiction, yet it is the
pillar of all the Erastian doctrine, that the Magistrate as the Magistrate has
the supreme power of all Church government. Therefore (says he, page 171.)
they do wickedly who Erastus ib. 171.
take from the Magistrate that part of the visible jurisdiction in government
of the Church which God has given to him, and subject the Magistrate to some
other jurisdiction, -- Magistrates are Gods.

Ans. If to preach, dispense the Sacraments, and to judge who are unworthy of
the Seals, and debar them, be taken from the Magistrate as he is a Christian,
this power of visible jurisdiction over the Church is no more taken by us from
the Magistrate, then it is taken from all Christians as Christians, and in
regard of any such power Magistrates are no more Gods and Nursefathers in the
Church, then all Christians are Gods and Nursefathers of the Church: for by the
reason of Erastus, p. 175. that all Christians now are Priests and Prophets,
and so may examine who are worthy of the seals, who not, then the Civil
Magistrate can be, by us, spoiled of nothing that God has given him, as a
Magistrate, except Erastus say that he does all these as a Magistrate and
virtute officij; which when he or any of his Disciples shall assert, beside
that it is contradictorious to his way, we are ready to demonstrate that it is
blasphemous and contrary to the word of God. But that Erastus does take from
the Elders of the Church, and give to the Magistrate a power to judge in an
Ecclesiastical way, who are to be debarred from the seals, I argue on the
contrary thus; those who are to cut the word, and distribute it aright, are
also to distribute the seals a right, to the worthy, not to dogs and swine, not
to heathens and publicans, for it is evident that the right stewarding and
distributing of ordinances does essentially include the stewarding of them,
with judgment and discerning, to those that are worthy, not to those that are
unworthy. But Elders, not Civil Magistrates are to do the former, Ergo the
latter also. 2. Those to whom Christ committed the power of the keys to open
and shut, to bind and loose, to those he has given the use and exercise of the
keys. But Christ gave the power of the keys to the Apostle Peter, as
representing the Rulers of the Church, Mat. 16. 19. and to the Church, Mat. 18.
18. and not to the Magistrate as to the Magistrate; Ergo, The proposi^ion I
prove from the Texts, Mat. 18. 18. What ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound
in heaven, etc. and Cha. 16. 19. the same is repeated: now actual binding is
the use and exercise of the keys given to Peter and the Church. But it is
presumed the power is given, when Christ says, v. 19. I will give unto thee,
the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. 2. We read not that God gives a power, a
gift, a talent, or an office, but he judges it a sin in those to whom he
gives it, not to put forth in acts and in exercise that gift, talent, and
office, either by themselves, or his deputies; which latter I speak for the
King, who in his own person, and in the person of inferior judges sent by him,
do put forth in acts of justice, the Royal power that God has given him. The
assumption is Scripture.

Erastus has no answer to this, but the keys were given to Peter as
representing all the faithful, not the Elders, and that all private Christians
do bind and loose.

Ans. Besides, this is answered fully above, and is a mere anarchicall
Democracy; it, 2. concludes well that Christ gave not to the Magistrate as the
Magistrate, the keys, but to the Magistrate as he is a Christian, making that
same Christian confession of faith with Peter, Mat. 16. and as he is an
offended brother, who may bind and loose in earth and heaven, so Erastus These.
54. p. 42. and so by this the Magistrate has no more power to debar from the
seals, then all other Christians have. 3. If Christ give the key of knowledge
to the Elders, then he cannot give the power of studying Sermons, and preaching
the word to another; so if Christ give the power of breaking the bread of life
to the children of the house, then he cannot give the power of judging, who are
the children of the house, who not, to another.

Ob. But the Magistrate is only to examine the fact, and to punish adultery,
incest and the like, that deserve to be punished by the sword, but not whether
it be a scandal that deserve exclusion from the Sacrament, or not; Ministers
are to take the probation of the scandalous fact by witness from the Magistrate,
and so to exclude from the Lords supper, and to deal with the man's conscience
to bring him to repentance, so do some argue.

Ans. If the Church be to try the penitency, or impenitency of the fact, and
not to cognosce and try whether he has done the fact, upon the same ground the
Magistrate is to try and punish the disturbance of the peace of the
Commonwealth, that adhereth to the fact, and not to try the fact. 2. It is not
possible that the Church can know whether the man be penitent, or no, except by
witnesses they know the fact, for they shall run a preposterous way, to work
the man to a godly sorrow, for that sin which possibly he never committed;
now that of which the Church is to convince the man, and from which they are to
gain his soul, that they are to find out. 2. This is against the way of
Erastus, who will have the Magistrate to exclude from the Sacraments, and none
other. 3. The word knows no such thing, as that Ministers should be led in the
acts of their Ministerial duties, to whom they should dispense the mysteries
of the Gospel, and to whom they should deny them; by the Magistrate? by a good
warrant the Magistrate is to lay a tie on the consciences of Elders, what they
should dispense, as to whom they should dispense; sure if the Magistrate as the
Magistrate must prescribe to Ministers, to what sort of persons they must
dispense word and Sacraments, he must upon the same ground as a Magistrate
prescribe what Doctrine they should preach to this man, not to this, whether
Law or Gospel; and so the Magistrate as the Magistrate must be a Pastor to cut
the word aright, 2 Timothy 2. 15. Eze. 3. 18, 19, 20. Eze. 13. 19. to command to
preach life to this man, death to this man. 4. If the Church must cast him out,
and judge him who has done this wickedness, 1 Cor. 5. 2, 12. and 4. 5, 6. 7.
then must they judge of his scandal; that according to the quality of the
scandal, they may proportion the measure of the punishment; Ergo, a pari they
must judge whom they debar from the seals. 5. The debarring any from the
seals, must be proportioned to the end of all spiritual censures, that the man
be gained, and his sin loosed in heaven, Mat. 18. 15. 18. that his soul may
be saved in the day of the Lord, 1 Cor. 5. 4. That he may be ashamed, and so
humbled, 2 These. 3. 14, 15. 2 Cor. 2. 6, 7. that he may learn not to blaspheme,
1 Timothy 1. 20. But the Magistrates excluding of any from the Sacraments is no
mean congruous to such an end, for he can command nothing, but the disobedience
of which he can and ought to punish with the sword; now a carnal weapon cannot
be congruous and proportionable to a spiritual end. 6. If the Magistrate as a
Magistrate must so far have the keys of Discipline, then as a Magistrate he
must catechize, examine, and try the knowledge of the Communicants, and so
watch for their souls, as those that must give an account to God. 7. The
Magistrate must have a Negative voice in all the acts of the Church, and the
man must be bound in heaven, but not except the Magistrate will, and loosed in
heaven, but not except the Magistrate will, for all must depend upon the
consent of him to whom Jesus Christ has committed the supreme* and highest and
only power of governing the Church; now this is the Magistrate as the
Magistrate to Erastus. 8. The Magistrate as the Magistrate must forgive sinners
and relaxe them from excommunication, 2 Cor. 2. 7. and restore those that are
overtaken in offenses, with the spirit of meekness, Gal. 6. 1. and rebuke
publicly those that sin publicly, 1 Timothy 5. 20. and so be a spiritual man,
and a Pastor. Neither does it follow that the Pastors as Pastors only, should
debar from the Communion, though virtute potestatis ordinis as Pastors, they
are to keep themselves pure, and not to give pearls to swine, nor to
communicate with other men's sins; yet because the Sacraments are Church
ordinances, they are to be dispensed by the Church, that is, by the Elders with
consent of the people: it is one thing to dispense ordinances to those that
receive them, and another thing to dispense them ce^^o ordine after a Church
way, the former is from power of order, the latter from power of jurisdiction,
and from the Church only.

CHAP. XV.
Quest. 11.
Whether Erastus do validly confute a Presbytery.

Erastus. What consequence is this? Lev. 10. God commands Answer to the l. 4.
c. 3. of Erastus. p. 266. 267 how Erastus confuteth a Presbytery.
Aaron and his sons to put a difference between the holy and profane, the
clean and the unclean, this difference they were to teach the people out of
the Law; Ergo, God has ordained a College of Ecclesiastical Senators to
exercise the power of the Civil Magistrate? it is like this; God commanded the
Pastors to teach the people, and dispense the Sacraments; Ergo, he instituted a
Presbytery in place of the Magistrate.

Ans. This consequence is so strong (though the consequent be not ours) to
prove a Synedrie, that Erastus shall never be able to refute it; for that the
Priests might teach the people, they were to judge and govern the people, and
were to judge between the holy and profane, not only that the Priests might
inform the p^oples minds, but that the Priests and Levites might, 2 Chronicles. 9.
8* 9 10. Deuteronomy. 17. 8, 9 give judgment between blood and blood, between plea
and plea, between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy, and hard
to be judged by the inferior judges; these concerned not the instruction of
the people as matters of opinion, as Erastus imagines; but they concerned the
governing of the people in justice, that v. 12. the man that will do
presumptuously, or will not hearken unto the Priest or the judge, shall die the
death? Was not this to govern the people and to judge them? Certainly Erastus
in the same Chapter says so, to wit, that there was one common Synedrim of
civil judges, Priests and Levites at Jerusalem, that the Priests and Levites
were Judges in capital matters, and gave out the sentence of death, de capite
and sanguine, Page 27^. Page 269. 270.
and he proves page 270. 271. that the Priests were civil judges, and did
give s^^tences of blood, of life and death: Ergo, the Priests did not discern
between the clean and the unclean, between blood and blood only, that they
might teach the people, but that they might regulate their own practice in
judgment, and govern the people; yea that the Priests might pronounce some
unclean, and to be put out of the Camp so many days, that they might debar
out of the Sanctuary the uncl^an, the uncircumcised, the strangers, and Lev.
10. the end of judging and governing is expressly set down, v. 10. and so a
judicature, and the other end, v. 11. that they may teach the children of
Israel all the Statutes which the Lord has spoken by the hand of Moses. 2.
From the Elders preaching the Word and dispensing the Sacraments, simply we
infer no judicature A Church judicature in the Jewish Church Deuteronomy. 17.
at all, far less a politic judicature, which we do not ascribe to the
Priests, for John Baptist both preached the Word and baptized, and yet was no
judge, nor did he erect any Church judicature, but from the power of the keys
given to the Church, and exercised by the Church, Mat. 16. 19. Mat. 18. 15, 16,
etc. 1 Cor. 5. 1, 2, 3. etc. Revel. 2. 1, 2, 3, etc. we infer a Church
judicature, we never placed a Presbytery in place of the Magistrate; for it is
no more the Magistrates place, then to sacrifice is the place of the Magistrate.

Erastus. J wonder that you seek your Presbytery in Moses Law, Page 267.
all yours, say the Synedrie, Christ speaks of did rise after the captivity,
at least when the sword was taken from the Jews. They say David and Solomon
did punish vices, they approve August. 39. quest. in Deuteronomy. that Excommunication
does now what putting to death did of Old, and deny any Excommunication to have
been in the Church of the New Testament.

Ans. Erastus declares himself to be a child, not versed in Protestant
Divines, for we except Musculus, Gualther, Bullinger, some except Aretius, all
our Protestant Divines go the way Beza goes. 2. Let him produce any of ours,
who say that the Synedry that Christ speaks of, was Jewish, and ours say that
Christ alludeth to the Jewish Synedrie: But all (few excepted) that Christ Mat.
18. speaks of the Christian Church to be erected. 3. The Kings of Israel
punished scandals, but that is not enough, did they govern the Church,
pronounce who were clean or unclean? or middle with the charge of Ecclesiastic
Government committed to Aaron and his sons? 4. We say with Augustine, that
some that were killed of old, are to be Excommunicated now, Augustine speaks
not of all, and what is that against us?

Erastus. Not any but your self (Beza) say that Moses speaks Page 268.
of th^se same persons, things, and office, Levit. 10. and Deuteronomy. 17. in Levit.
10. he speaks only of the Priesthood, and Deuteronomy. 17. of the Judges or
Magistrates.

Ans. Beza expounds the one place by the other, but he says not these
persons, things and office are in both places. 2. Erastus only contradicts
Beza, and says Moses speaks of the Magistrates, Deuteronomy. 17. But he is refuted
by the Spirit of God, 2 Chronicles. 19. 8, 9. who repeating the very words of Deuteronomy.
17. says the Judges here were Priests, Levites, and heads of Families, whom
all men deny to be Magistrates.

Erastus. You say Deuteronomy. 17. mention is made of blood, of the cause of Pleas,
not because the Synedrie judged of the fact, but because they answered the true
sense of the Law; I say, whether they answered of the fact, or of the Law, they
sentenced judicially of life and death, so that there was no provocation from
them to the civil judicature, for he was put to death, who would not stand to
their sentence, but you deny that any politic causes or matters of blood or
death, belongs to your Presbytery.

Ans. 1. Beza said well the fact, and the putting of the man to death, which is
the assumption and conclusion belonged to the civil judge, not to the Priests;
But the question juris, the question of Law belonged to the Ecclesiastical
judicature of Priests, Levites and Elders; and it is evident, that it was a
case of conscience, concerning a matter, or an admirable cause that cannot be
determined by the judges in the city, they not being so well versed in the Law
as the Priests, whose lips should preserve knowledge, Mal. 2. 7. Therefore it
is not a fact, that may be cleared by Witnesses, there is not such difficulty
in facts, except in adultery, or secret Murders, the word comes from (...)
to admire, or to be separated from sense and reason, Lament. 1. 9. Genesis 18. 14.
Is there any thing hard to, or ^id from Jehovah? 2. They are called (...)
causes or matters of contention, Vatablus causa insolita and difficilior: Our
translation has it, matters of controversy. 3. It is said, thou shall come
(...)
and inquire or diligently search out. 4. The Priests and Levites shall show
thee the sentence of judgment, so it is evident that the Priests and Levites
did not so much judge, as declare and resolve the law-part of which the
inferior judges did doubt, for the difficulty of the question, as Saul came to
Samuel the Seer, to ask concerning his fathers asses, and it is true bloods
and strokes came under the cognizance of the Priests, but as bloods comes
before Lawyers, and those that are expert in the civil Law, in the Parliament
of England and Scotland, the Lawyers as Judges put no man to The Priests put no
man to death.
death, the King could say, fall upon such an evil doer, and kill him, and the
judges and Princes might put to death. But you never read that the Priests, yea
or the High Priest said, fall upon such an ill doer and kill him, nor was this
any Law of God, that the Ecclesiastic Sanedrim, should put to death and
politically condemn any man to die, or command any man's blood to be shed, they
but declared and resolved a case of conscience to the judges, and a plea, and
said, This is a matter of blood, and deserves death by the Law of God, and he
that has done such a fact in point of Law, ought to die. But there were two
things left to the civil^ Judges. 1. Whether this man has done such a fact. 2.
A sitting in the Tribunal, and saying, I or we command and decree such a man
who has shed such blood, has inflicted such a stroke on this woman who is
with child of living birth, to be stoned to death, to be hanged. Erastus has
not proved, nor never shall prove that the High Priests, Priests or Levites, by
Gods Law did thus judge any: That Ananias commanded Paul to be beaten, and the
lictors of the High Priest smote Christ on the face at the command of the
Priests, was against Law, they had no power so to do by Law, yea, and our
Presbyteries that judge of sorceries, witchcrafts, incests, adulteries, and
other capital crimes, and of bloods in point of Gods Law, what is witchcraft,
what is incest, that the husband that strikes his wife being with quick*child,
and kills the birth is a Murderer; but that they judicially say, such a
woman is a Witch, and so ordain her to be hanged and burnt, and such a husband
is a Murderer, and decerne him to die, is utterly unlawful, therefore this is
an ignorant speech of Erastus: This synedrie of Priests and Levites, whether in
point of Law, or in point of ^act, did give out sentences of death, therefore
they were politic judges, it follows not; and that the Priests said, this
man deserves to die, and therefore they gave out, as civil judges, sentences
of death, (for the civil judge draws not the sword with his own hand,) is a
foul consequence; for lawyers do say such a man is worthy to die, but it
follows not that Lawyers are civil judges to condemn a man to die; for the
Priests said, this man deserves to die in point of Law, not absolutely, as
this man, but upon supposition that he has committed the fact, deserves to
die, and their meaning is, any man whosoever he be, though they never hear, nor
see the man who has committed such a fact, ought to die. Now Gods Law never
appointed any judge to condemn a man to die, whom the judge never did accuse,
hear, or see, this were extreme unjustice: Now this supposition is, and was
to be proved and judged by the civil Judge; and whereas Erastus says, the
judge draws the sword with his own hand against no man; 1. It is not to
purpose, for the hangman is in Law the hand and instrument of the judge, but he
is neither hand nor instrument of the Lawyer, of the Priests and Levites, who
in matters criminal of life and death, judge of the Mayor proposition, and of
the Law, except Erastus would have a Major proposition to prove an Assumption,
which were to shame all Logic: For the Priest never commanded this or this
man, because he had done this fault, to be stoned by such and such
executioners. 2. It is doubtful whether the judge did never with his own hand,
cast a stone at any stoned to death. Lastly, there was no provocation from the
great Sanedrim at Jerusalem, true, in matter of Law, what then? Ergo, they were
politic judges? it follows as the like consequences of Erastus does follow.
Yea, for the fact and the judicial condemning of the man, they were neither
the highest judicature, nor any judicature at all, the civil Judges of the
high Sanedrim did that only. It is true, he was to die who would not stand to
the sentence of the judge or Priest in the matter of Law, the man being judged
to be guilty of the fact by the civil judge, but this shall never prove that
the Priests were civil judges.

Erastus. The late Jews refer to this Sanedrim at Jerusalem Page 269.
questions of making war, or consecrating the Priest, of tributes, of charges
of the Temple, of judging of Tribes, of the censuring of false Prophets, and of
Soothsayers, etc. How then is it not a politic judicature in which all causes
belonging to worship, Ceremonies, civil policy, bloods, and capital
punishments were handled? for when Moses had spoken of the punishing of
Idolaters, he presently adds Deuteronomy. 17. If any thing be hard for thee, etc

Ans. It is like enough, the Jews referred such as these to the Sanedrim, but
we contend for two Sanedrims, one civil, and another of Priests, Levites and
Elders, who judged of matters only of Ecclesiastical cognizance, and of
bloods, and punishing Idolaters and false Prophets with death, only in a
spiritual way, in point of Law; and I judge the holy Ghost Deuteronomy. 17. has so
framed the words that it is evident, as I have proved that capital crimes
belonged to them in point of Law; for he says not, he that refuses to die
when the Priests and Levites condemn him to die, he shall surely die, and
have the benefit of appeal to no higher judicature, Now this he should have
said by Erastus his way; but he that will not stand to the sentence of the
Priest or judge shall die. Hence it is clear, he speaks of things in matters
of Law, in which the guilty might dis-assent, and allege the Priests had not
judged according to Law. But how was it the mind of the holy Ghost that any
could refuse the Sentence of death given out by the Priests? for the meaning
must be by Erastus his way, he that refuses to die, when the Priest condemns
him to die, he shall surely die. 2. He says not that the Priests and Levites
shall give out sentences of death and blood against any man, but they shall
show and teach thee when thou shall inquire, the sentences of judgment, even
of Idolaters, blasphemers, of Murders, and blood, according to the Law of God,
the knowledge of which the Priests lips should preserve.

Erastus. Moses instituted no other public judicatures for punishing Page 270.
of wickedness, but those he makes mention of Exodus 18. Numb. 11. Deuteronomy. 1. 16,
17. But all th^se were only civil, not Ecclesiastical Judges. The seventy
that were endued with the spirit of prophecy were given to help Moses and ^ase
him, not to be assistants to help Aaron, and it cannot be doubted but Moses
his government was civil.

Ans. Both the Major and the Minor is false, the Major is from some particular
places, negative, he should argue from all the Old Testament, and he argues
from some places only, he leaves out Levit. 10. and all the places where the
Priests were only to judge the Leper, the unclean, which are spiritual
judicatures, not civil. 2. The Assumption is false; Deuteronomy. 17, says the
contrary. 3. Though we could not show a place for the formal institution of an
Ordinance, yet if we show the thing instituted, it is sufficient. 4. Erastus
much doubts himself, if Moses his government was altogether civil,
especially before the Lord separated Aaron his sons and the Tribe of Levi to
teach and govern the people in an Ecclesiastical way, for Erastus said before
that Moses prescribed Laws to Aaron, sacrificed and did that which was proper
to the Priests, though after that God forbad the Kings to usurp the Priests
office, and punished Saul and Vzziah for so doing, (though I never read that
Saul usurped the Priests office, you may take it upon the word of Erastus) and
we all know that Moses was a Prophet of God, Deuteronomy. 18. 18. I will raise them up
a Prophet from amongst their brethren like unto thee, Deuteronomy. 34. 10. And there
arose not a Prophet in Israel since, like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face
to face, Heb. 3. 5. Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant:
Now those that will say Moses his government of the Church was all civil and
political, as a civil judge and King, and that he acted not in the
government of the Church, as in writing and delivering Laws, and in doing many
things, yea in commanding the will of God, as a Prophet to Aaron, to his sons,
and the whole tribe of Levi, to me speaks nonsense.

Erastus. That judicature to the which the inferiors appealed, as to Page 270.
271.
the supreme, is politic.

Ans. It is denied, they appealed to it, as the supreme Ecclesiastic in point
of Law and Conscience: Ergo, It was not politic, all the rest are answered
before, yea, Iehoshaphat 2 Chronicles. 19. puts this as a thing peculiar to the
Priests, v. 12. What cause soever shall come before you of your brethren, --
between blood and blood, between Law and Commandment, Statutes and Judgments,
ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the Lord; that is, as
Erastus yields, ye shall teach them what is just and agreeable to, and what
is unjust and repugnant to the Law of God. Civil judges lips were not to
preserve knowledge, as the lips of the Priests, Mal. 2. 7. and Deuteronomy. 17. 11.
According to the sentence of the Law that they shall teach thee, and according
to the judgment that they shall tell, thou shall do. Hence it is clear that
this judicature in civil things was a teaching, a telling, a declaring and
resolving judicature, and that in blood they resolved of causes of blood, of
strokes, but judged not persons, nor bloody men, nor violent persons.

Erastus. Moses and Iehoshaphat speak of one and the same judicature. Page 272.
Moses does not give teaching and commanding divisibly to some, but jointly to
all the Synedrie. Though the Priests were more skilled in the Law, for Moses
commands to teach the sense of the Law by judgeing, as he says himself,
Exodus 18. 16. I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the
statutes of God and his laws; Moses puts them all jointly together, they
shall tell thee, thou shall do what they show thee, according to the Law
that they shall teach thee shall thou do, not declining to the right hand, or
to the left hand.

Ans. 1. That Iehoshaphat speaks of the same judicature that Moses speaks
of, is clear, 2 Chronicles. 19. 8, 9. 10. The very words of Moses Deuteronomy. 17. 8. are
the same, both the same judges, and the same causes, compared with v. 5, 6, 7.
But Iehoshaphat makes two judicatures, as I have proved, and Iehoshaphat
reformed according to Moses his Law, as Erastus grants. 2. I cannot be
induced to believe that the judges here teached by judging, it is spoken
contrary to Theology: The end of teaching is to inform the conscience,
Teaching and judgeing not one.
and Teachers as Teachers watch for the soul; and the end of civil and
politic judging, is a quiet and peaceable life, 1 Timothy 2. 2. the weapons of
teachers are not carnal, but spiritual, 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5. the weapons of
civil Judges are carnal, for the civil Judge bears not the svvord in
vain, Romans 13. 4. then these same civil judges did not both teach and judge
at once, they taught not as civil judges, but as Priests; they judged not as
Priests, but as civil Judges; and therefore there is no ground to say that
Moses ascribes these same acts to civil judges, and Priests and Levites, as
if they made one Synedry; for in both Texts not one word of teaching, which is
proper to the Priests, Mal. 2. 7. Ier. 2. 8. Hos. 4. 6. is ascribed to the
civil Judge; and not one word of judging and condemning to death, which is
proper to the civil Judge, Number. 35. 24. Deuteronomy. 22. 18, 19, Deuteronomy. 17. 2. 3, 4,
etc. and 21. 19, 20. 1 King. 21. 11. 2 Samuel 14. 15. 1 Kings 2. 28, etc. Romans
13. 4. Luke 12. 13. 14. etc. is ascribed to the Priests and Levites; but the
Priest or the judge are set down by way of disjunction, Deuteronomy. 17. 12. which
could not be if they made one and the same judicature, and therefore
Iehoshaphat 2 Chronicles. 19. clearly distinguishes them in two judicatures, one
v. 5, 6, 7. Another v. 8, 9, 10. having two sundry presidents, and two sundry
objects to treat about, to wit, the matters of Jehovah, and the matters of the
King. 3. The place cited Exodus 18. 16. confirms much our opinion, for Moses
as a Judge says, when they have a matter, they come unto me, and I judge
between one and another. This he spoke as a civil Judge; and when he says,
And I make them know the statutes of God and his laws: This he spoke as a
prophet, for Moses was both a Judge and a Prophet. Now if all civil Judges be
such mixed persons, as to teach the Stautes and Laws of God, they do this
either as civil judges, or as Prophets, then there was reason why Malachie
should have said, the civil judges lips should preserve knowledge, and they
should seek the Law at his The civil Judge as a Judge cannot teach.
mouth; for if a civil judge, as a Judge teach the people, and watch for their
souls, what marvel then he bear the sword to preserve their bodies, as a
Prophet, and not as a Judge; and if he bear the sword as a Prophet and
Teacher, all Teachers must bear the sword: which is against reason and
Scripture, and what reason is there, if Moses teach as a civil judge, but he
may as properly be obliged in conscience to teach, and so he should sin if he
employ not his talent that way, as he is obliged to exercise the sword as a
judge? and by the contrary, a Prophet as a Prophet should be obliged in
conscience, as kindly and per se, to exercise the Sword as to preach the
Gospel, for nothing agrees more kindly to the subject, then that which agrees
to it (...) under that reduplication, as it is such; Now this is against sense
and reason, and confounds all callings on earth: but if Erastus grant that
Moses judges as a civil judge, and teaches the people the Law of God as a
prophet, then to make this Sanedrim a mixed company both to judge civilly, and
to teach as spiritual men by office, must all the Priests and Levites in this
Sanedrim be both Priests and Levites, and also civil Judges? And all the
civil Judges must be both civil judges, and also Priests and Levites, which
is expressly against the Text, that speaks Deuteronomy. 17. of the Priest, or the
Judge, as two distinct offices, and so God must have chosen the Judge no less,
then the Priest to minister before him. So, it is false, that teaching and
judging are copulatively ascribed to these same persons, and to the same
judicature, as Erastus says.

Erastus. He says Deuteronomy. 17. he shall die who stands not to the sentence Page
272.
of the Priest or judge, by way of disjunction, in regard of diverse times, for
the Princes or Judges were not always the same, for often only the Priests
governed, and for the same reason he says not, Deuteronomy. 17. ascend to Jerusalem,
but to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, for the Arc was not
always in one place, or city; So Deuteronomy. 19. when he speaks of the false
witness, he says, and they shall stand before the Lord, that is, before the
Priests and Judges that shall be at that time. Who would think that there are
here distinct and diverse Iudicatures?

Ans. It is a conjecture of Erastus, that Moses speaks Deuteronomy. 17. of the
Priest or the Judge by way of disjunction, because of diverse times, not of
diverse and distinct Tribunals, for all Moses his time, and Joshua's time, and
for the most part, there were both Judges and Priests, and we had rather
believe the Spirit of God then Erastus, for 2 Chronicles. 19. under Iehoshaphat at
one and the same time, there were both civil Judges, and Priests and Levites,
and these two Judicatures had two different sorts of causes, and two different
Presidents; if then at one and the same time the man was to be put to death,
who did not stand to the sentence of the Priest, though he should stand to the
sentence of the civil judge; and so if he was to be put to death, who should
stand to the sentence of the Priests, and give an outside of obedience to the
Ceremonial Law, if he should not stand to the sentence of the civil Judge,
then were there at the same time these two sentences in these two judicatures:
but the former is true by the express Law of God; Ergo, so is the latter: when
God says, Go up to the place that the Lord shall choose, he means Jerusalem,
and one determinate place at once, and if Moses had said, Go up to the place
that the Lord shall choose; or to some other place that the Lord shall not
choose, then could I infer well, that at one and the same time, they might
have gone to either places, or to both places, having two sorts of causes, as
there be ever two sorts of causes in the Church, some Civil, some
Ecclesiastical. 3. Erastus should have shown a time when only the Priest as
the Priest did govern, and there neither was a civil Judge, nor was that
Priest who governed the civil judge: If Erastus show not this, he shows
nothing for his own cause, which is to make one confused Judicature of civil
and Ecclesiastical Judges and causes, which the Scripture does carefully
distinguish. 4. In the place Deuteronomy. 19. nothing is said against us, but that
only the civil Judge put to death the false Witness; which is much for us,
that though the false witness was to stand before the Priests, and incur an
Ecclesiastic censure, yet the Priest as Priest had no hand in putting him to
death.

Erastus. Sometime the Priest was president in this Sanedrim, Page 272. 273.
as Eli and Samuel, without a judge; therefore when it is said, the chief
Priest was ^ver them in all the matters of the Lord, and Zebadiah in the Kings
matters, they made not two different Iudicatures; and the high Priest and
Zebadiah were both over the same Judicature. Josephus excellently versed in
the Jewish laws, says, antiq. lib. 9. c. 1. they were (...) fellows or
companions; then they were not in diverse Senats. The Levites were equally
servants to both, though it may be the Priests were more diligently to go
about the canses of God, and the Judges the causes of the King.

Ans. Were Eli and Samuel presidents in the Sanedrim without a Judge? that is
as much as to say, Eli and Samuel, who undoubtedly by the Testimony of the
Spirit of God were civil Judges of Israel, 1 Samuel 4 18. and 7. 15. and 8. 1.
7. were Judges without Judges: I conceive Eli was both a Priest and a Judge;
and Samuel both a Prophet and a Judge; whether Samuel was a Priest or not, let
Erastus determine. Samuel was of the Tribe of Ephraim, Erastus makes the
Magistrate and the Priest or Pastor formally one.
not a Priest, though he sacrificed by an extraordinary Privilege; nor was
Moses a Priest. 2. I see no reason to say, Eli was a Priest without a Judge,
more then to say he was a Judge without a Priest, for he was both. But this may
show the Reader, that Erastus always confounds the office of the Priest, and
the Civil judge, so as he makes them not only subjectively one, which God
himself did in the person of Eli, but also one formally; for as I show before
Erastus must say, Eli sacrificed as a Judge, and he condemned Clar. Vir.

ill doers to die and exercised the sword as a Priest; and Samuel prophesied as
a Magistrate, and Samuel did judge Israel as a Prophet; for the Magistrate as
the Magistrate to Erastus, does both the part of a Judge, of a Priest and
Prophet of old, and now of a Pastor and Teacher. 3. It is enough to us that
Amariah and Zebadiah were over diverse causes, in diverse Courts, and
differenced, 2 Chro. 19. in that the one was, for the kings matters, the other
for Gods matters. Erast. says right down, they were both for these same
matters. But the one was to care more for the Kings matters, the other more for
Gods matters: so Erastus is forced to make a difference: But he makes it in
the comparative degree, and the spirit of God makes the difference in the
positive degree: But 1. Erastus says without the Text, Amariah was to care for
the matters of the King, but more for the matters of God: The Text says no
such thing, but the contrary: he says, Zebadiah the Civil Magistrate was to
care for the matters of God, but more for the matters of the King: 4. This is
against Erastus his his way; which is that the Magistrate has a supreme
principal and only care of Church Government, and the Priests and Levites, and
Pastors and Teachers only, as the servants of the Magistrates, A and sub
Magistratibus, as Vtenbogard speaks, from and under the Magistrate, as the
Vicars, Deputies, and Ambassadors of the Magistrate; yea, that Magistrates
teach the people by the Pastors, as by their Vicars, then Zebadiah should more
diligently care for the matters of God, then Amariah as the Lord and Master
should more care his own business, then his servant should do: 3. More or
less does not vary the nature of things; then must the Magistrate Sacrifice,
Teach, judge between the clean and the unclean, minister before the Lord as the
sons of Aaron, and the sons of Levi, but less diligently. But what calling
has he to any of these Acts at all? Has the Lord chosen the Tribe of Judah,
or the Tribe of Levi to minister before him? And by the same reason, the
Priests, Levites should do these same things, but more diligently. And again
Amariah is to use the sword, and to condemn ill doers to death: But less
diligently, these be pleasant dreams. 5. The Priest and Judges are companions,
as Moses and Aaron: Ergo, the one is not Master and the other servant and
Deputy, ^^ Erastus dreameth, and they are the rather of that in diverse Senats.
6. But how proves Erastus, That the Levites were common Servants both to
Priests and Judges? For though it were so, this will never subject the Priests
to the Civil Judge, nor confound these two Iudicatures: David 1 Chronicles. 26.
divided the Levites, and set them in their courses for service; Ergo, They were
King David's servants as King, it follows not, except Erastus prove David did
not this as a Prophet, and that the Lord did not choose the Tribe of Levi. But
David did it as a King, and so all Magistrates may appoint offices in the House
of God, and call men to the Ministry, by virtue of the Magistrates place: But
David, 1 Chro. 24. distributed the Priests as well as the Levites; Ergo, the
Priests are servants to the King, as well as the Levites. But the Levites are
expressly, 1. Chron. 26. given by office, to wait on the sons of Aaron, for the
service of the house of the Lord, for the purifying the holy things, for the
show bread, for the fine flour for meat offerings, and for the unleavened
Cakes, and that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for
all manner of measures and size, to praise the Lord at morning and night; to
offer all burnt sacrifices to the Lord, etc. In all which no man can say, they
were servants to the King: For then the King sacrificed by them, as by his
servants; no Divinity is more contrary to Scripture.

It is true, 1 Chronicles. 26. 30. some of the Hebronites were Officers in all the
business of the Lord, and the service of the King. But that is because, ver.
26. they had the oversight of the spoil, that the King dedicated to the house
of the Lord, for the building of the Temple, and that is called the Kings
business.

Erastus. Jehoshaphat, 2 Chronicles. 19. did not depart from Moses Page 274.
his Law: But we read not, that there were two distinct Jurisdictions commanded
and instituted by God.

Ans. If this be a good Argument; all that David and Solomon did for, and in
the building of the Temple in the structure, form, length, breadth, Cedars,
gold, Altars, etc. of the Temple shall be without Warrant; Solomon and David
departed not from Moses: But Moses spoke nothing of the Temple, and a thousand
things of Divine institution in the Temple.

But this is our Argument, Jehoshaphat did erect no new Iudicatures, but
restore those that had their Warrant from Moses his Law. But so it is that
Iehoshaphat reinstituteth two distinct Iudicatures; Ergo, The Lord by Moses at
the beginning did institute these two distinct Iudicatures.

Erastus. We are not anxiously to inquire what be the matters of Page 274. What
are the matters of the Lord and of the King, 2 Chronicles. 19.
God; it is all one with what he said before; ye judge not for men, but for the
Lord. The Rabbines, the judgment of Capital causes is the judgment of souls,
the scripture names all judgments most frequently, the judgments of the
Lord, Deuteronomy. 1. Ye shall not fear men; for the judgment is the Lords, Exodus 18.
The people come to me to inquire of God, that is, to seek judgment: Therefore
are the Judges, Exodus 22. Psalm. 82. called Gods, The matter of God, is any
cause expressed in the Law of God, and proposed to the Judges to be judged; and
the Kings matter, is that which properly belongs to the King.

Ans. Erastus his anxiety to inquire is little, because he cannot Answer: 1.
The matter of the Lord cannot be all one with this, Ye judge not for men, but
for the Lord: For the matter of the King, or a point of Treason to be judged,
is to be judged not for men, but for the Lord. But the Text differenceth
between the matters of Lord, and the matters of the King. 2. In the former, 2 Chronicles. 19. 5. he speaks of civil business; but the matters of the Lord are
such as concern the Law of God, and the true sense and meaning thereof to be
proposed to the conscience; and 3. That is a common thing to all causes, that
in the manner of Judging, Judges are to look that they do as men in the place
of God, so then as God, if he were judging, would do no iniquity, nor respect
persons, nor take gifts, as he says, ver. 7. So neither should men do
iniquity, or respect persons in judgment; and so is it taken, Deuteronomy. 1. 17. Now
this clearly is the manner of righteous judgment, and Modus judicandi, but the
matter of Jehovah is Res judicata; the thing to be judged, which may be
unjustly Judged: and this matter of Jehovah is not common to all causes, but is
contradistinguished in the Text, from the matters of the King, which in the
manner of judging is no less to be judged according to the judgment of the
Lord, then the matters of Jehovah.

4. The Chalde Paraphrast, Vt inquir at instructionem, Vatab. Vt consulat deum.
This is a false interpretation, That to inquire of God, is to seek judgment
from God: For it is to ask the Lords mind in doubtsome cases; and this they
asked from Moses, as he was a Prophet, not as he was a civil Judge: except
Erastus will have the Magistrate of old to give responses, and to have been
Oracles by virtue of their Office: which is a clear untruth, Saul, David,
Solomon, Joshua, though Kings, did not give responsals, and answers when they
did go to War, or were in doubtsome perplexities. But did ask Counsel at the
Priest and Oracle of God and the Ark, 1 Samuel 15. 37. Josh. 9. 14. Judge. 20. 27.
1 Samuel 30. 8. and 23. 2. 4. And by this the Magistrate as the Magistrate should
resolve all doubts of conscience now to perplexed consciences, under the
New Testament. 5. The Judges are called Gods, because they are under-Deputies
in the room and place of the great God, not because every judgment of theirs
is the judgment, and very sentence of God, and according to that the cause
they judge is nothing but the cause of God, for they are to judge the Kings
matters, no less then Gods matters. 6. For what end Erastus speaks of the
Rabbines here I know not, I think he knows not himself; the man was ignorant
of them, and innocent of their language.

Erastus. I am not against, that the things of God be things belonging Page
274, 375.
to the Worship of God, and the matters of the Kings Civil business. The
Priest must especially take care, that there be no error in Faith and
Ceremonies: and this belongs also to the King, as is clear, Deuteronomy. 17. So
Zebadiah is not excluded from Gods matters: Nor Amariah from the Kings
business.

Ans. This interpretation is fully refuted: Zebadiah is in the Text, excluded
from judging Ecclesiastically, in the matters of God, as a Priest, Levite or
Elder. For if he must judge so, he must either judge as a Priest or Levite,
which he was not, or as a Civil Judge; if as a Civil Judge, then is he no
less over the people in the matters of God, then in the Kings matters: Now the
Text could not exclude him from these things which belongs to his office, and
put him in another Sphere, in the business of the King, and put such a wide
difference between the object of the two men, as the Kings matters, and the
matters of the King of Kings. The like I say of Amariah. 2. The King Deuteronomy. 17.
as King, is to Judge according to the Book of the Law, that he may be a godly
King, and fear God, and keep the words of the Law; Ergo, he is to teach the
people no less then the Priest, and to judge between the clean and unclean,
and that as King: This no way follows.

Erastus. If you please by the matters of God, to understand the Page 275.
causes of appeals, and by the Kings matters, other judgments, I contend not:
And because the Priest was better accustomed with the Law of God, then others,
therefore the High Priest was set over these, yet so, as Zebadiah was over the
Kings business: But I think the two first, especially the first, the best
Exposition: But 1 Chronicles. 26. These same persons are set over both the Kings and
the Lords matters.

Ans. Consider how dubious Erastus is in his three Expositions to elude the
force of the place. If it was the Magistrates place, virtute officii, by virtue
of his office to command the Priests, and to direct them (as Erastus and
Vtenbogard say) in the internal and specific acts of Sacrificing, Judging
between the clean and the unclean, teaching the people: then the King and the
Civil Judge were by office, to be more skilled in the Causes of God, then the
Priests, because the Commander and the directer, who may by his office exercise
those same acts that he commands his servants; yea, and is by office, to
command him to do thus, in these internal Acts, and not thus, he ought, by his
office, to be more skilled in these then the servant. I grant, the King
Commands the Painter, all the moral equity requisite in Painting, that he
endamage not the Commonwealth by prosuse lavishing of Gold; and in this, it is
presumed, there is more Justice and moral equity by office in the King
Commanding, then in the Painter Commanded: But if the King should take on him
to Command, virtute officii, that the Painter regulateth his actions of art,
thus and thus, and direct and Command by his Royal office, as King, that the
Painter draw the face of the Image with more pale and white, and less red and
incarnate color; in such a proportion according to art, and not in such a
proportion: Then by office the King as King, might paint Pourtraict^ himself;
and behoved by office to be more skilled in Painting then the Painter. Now
Erastus presupposes, Whatever the Priests do as Priests, in an Ecclesiastical
way, (he excepteth Sacrificing and burning incense, but for a time) that the
King as King may do the same also; so the King as King may teach, give
responses in matters of God, and now under the new Testament, Preach and
dispense the Sacraments, and judge as King, whether Priests and Pastors do
right or no; and that not only in order to Civil, but also to Ecclesiastical
punishments, as deprivation from their offices, and debarring from the
Sacraments; Hence it must follow, that Zebediah should, by office, be better
skilled in the matters of God then Amariah, or any Priest; and by office he
should rather be over the matters of God, then any Priest in the world. 2. Now
its clear that these same things, to be over men in the matter of God, and in
the matters of the King, 1 Chronicles. 26. proves nothing, except they be over
these same matters, by one and the same power of the Sword, as Erastus says;
Amariah the High Priest, and Zebediah the Civil Judge, promiscuously were both
of them, without exclusion of either, over the people in the matters of the
Lord, and in the matters of the King; and in the same judicature, and by the
same coactive power of the sword, as Erastus says, Priests and Civil Judges
were in the same judicature, by the same Civil power, Judges to give out
jointly, in a judicial way, the sentence of a bloody death, and to inflict a
bloody death by the same power. 3. It is Erastus his ignorance of the Original
Text, to say these same words that are 2 Chronicles. 19. 11. are also, 1 Chronicles, 26.
ver. 30, 32. for 2 Chronicles. 19. 11. it is said, Amariah is over you in all the
matters of the Lord: Hence the matters of the Lord, were the formal object of
his judging: But 1 Chronicles. 26. 30. the Hebronites were officers in the business
of the Lord, or, to the business of the Lord, and (...) Levites sometime
employed in Civil business.
to the service of the King. Levites might have been employed in both
Ecclesiastical and Civil business in the Temple, and in the overseeing of
those spoils, that David in Wars had taken from the Enemies, and Dedicated for
building the House of the Lord, which are called the Kings business; and the
construction, ver. 32. is varied, where it is said, The Hebronites mighty men
of valor, and so fit for war, were made by King David, Rulers over the
Reu^eni^es, Gadites, and the half Tribe of Manasseh for every matter; not in
every matter pertaining to God: The affixum (...) is here, and the affairs of
the King. These Levites seem to be employed in the war, and are called valiant
men, which must be some extraordinary case: But otherwise, when God commanded
to number the Children of Israel for War, Numb. 1. 3. 45. The Levites were not
numbered, God did forbid Moses to number them, because they were appointed for
another service, ver. 48, 49, 50. Yet it seems in David's time, when there
were ex^raordinary wars, that they were not exempted from the wars, for 1 Chronicles. 21. David commanded to number all Israel from Dan to Beersheb^, and v.
6. Levi and Benjamin Ioab counted not, for the Kings word was abominable to
Ioab; Whence to me it would seem, that in some cases they were counted for
war, so 2 Chronicles, 23. 7. The Levites shall compass the King, every man with
his weapons in his hands, and Iehoiada the High Priest was their leader, to
establish Ioash in his Throne; but the case was not ordinary. Otherwise the
Levites were separated from war and civil judicatures to the service of the
Sanctuary, Numb. 1. 47, 50. and 2. 33. and 3. 9. 12. and 3. 41, 45. and 8. 6.
and 9. 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 19. and 18. 23. Deuteronomy. 31. 25. Josh. 14* 3. 4. and
18. 7. 1 Chronicles. 15. 15. 2 Chronicles. 8. 14. and 20 19. and 29. 5, 16, 25, 26. Ezra
3. 9, 10. c. 6. 18. c. 8. 29. Ne^. 8. 7, 9. and 9. 4. Ezekiel. 44. 10. All which
places must be answered by Erastus.

CHAP. XVI.
Quest. 12.
Whether Erastus proves validly the power of the Civil Magistrate in matters
Ecclesiastic?

BEfore I proceed further, it is needful to examine Erastus his doctrine
Erastus l. 3. c. 1. Page 160. The power of the civil Magistrate.
of the civil Magistrate.

Erastus. As there is a twofold governing, so of necessity there must be two
supreme Governors. God is the governor of the inward man, the Magistrate of
the outward man, it is absurd there should be two supreme Governors of the
same Government, so as the one neither be a part of the other, nor Administer
all in the name of the other.

Ans. 1. Because a man consists of a spiritual part, a conscience and soul,
and of an external visible part; in which he exercises visible and external
acts of worship; yet spiritual, another, as he is a civil Agent, therefore
there is a necessity there be no supreme external Governors under the one
supreme Lord of Heaven and earth; one that teaches and informs the mind,
and rules by the sword whole man, as he is a part of a civil society, in all
his civil actions, and this is the Magistrate; another that governs him, as
he is a member of a spiritual and supernatural society, and exercises
external spiritual actions, in reference to God and in the subjection of his
conscience to him, and this is either a Priest, Levite or Prophet in the Old
Testament, or Pastor, Teacher or Elder in the New Testament: and it is absurd,
that there should not be two Governors; one over man in relation to his
conscience and walking with God, and his brethren as Members of a spiritual
society, called a Pastor or Teacher; another in relation to his civil actions
of Peace and justice to his brother, as he is a Member of a civil society,
called a Magistrate.

2. It is an absurd thing, for Erastus to fancy God, and the Men have need of
two sorts of Governors.
Magistrate, two supreme Governors, when the Magistrate is not supreme, but a
mere Minister and vassal subordinate to God, the only most high. 3. It is as
absurd to imagine God has given no Rulers, Teachers, and guides to govern a
man as he is a spiritual Agent obliged to worship God, and to be edified in
the faith, but only the civil Magistrate; then has Christ left no shepherd to
his redeemed flock but the Civil Magistrate, and ascending on high he has
left no gifts, no Pastors and Teachers, for the gathering of the Saints to the
end of the world, when we shall meet all in the unity of the Faith; but only
the Magistrate contrary to Christ's end, in ascending to heaven, Ephesians. 4. 11.
Act. 20. 28. 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2. and contrary to Christ's compassion to souls, who
is moved, that his sheep want shepherds; for there souls, rather then
Magistrates, Matthew. 9. 36, 37, 38. therefore the opinion of Erastus is like the
Divinity of Epicures or unchristian Moralists, who appoint Magistrates to
Govern the external man, but no Teachers to take care of their souls, or to
lead them to heaven.

Erastus. As there is one measure by which we measure things of Magistracy and
Ministry, both supreme in their on we kind.
diverse natures, as cloth of linen, of silk, of silver, of gold, and there
is one weight by which we measure things weighable, though of most diverse
natures; so is there one visible dispensation and governing of all visible
things, though there be some Laws for the City, some for the Country, some
for the Schools, as there be no necessity of diverse rulers, and Lawgivers, to
the City, to the Country, to the Schools; so is there no necessity that there
should be any other then the Magistrate, who should guide things civil and
profane, things of Schools, and things sacred.

Ans. This man speaks rather like a Moral, or a natural Physician, then a
Divine; the argument were good, if men had no souls, for then they should not
need any to watch for their souls, as the spirit of God says they do, Heb. 13.
17. and he with one stroke, takes away Pastors and Teachers, and makes the
King the only Pastor and Teacher in all his Kingdoms. 2. We know similitudes,
especially not warranted with Scripture, proves nothing, and this may well
conclude there should be no ruler at all, nor any Lawgiver on earth, but God
only, and let every man do what seems good in his own eyes, for Gods will is
the only measure and rule of all things. And 3. If all men were to be ruled the
same way, it might have color. But it is known, that all Churches, as members
of a Commonwealth, are ruled one way, in giving to every man his own, and in
not doing violence one to another; But in keeping peace and policy, as all men
do in all societies on earth, and so they have need of Magistrates. 2. Another
way they are considered as Members of a society, called from the state of
sin, to Grace and Glory, and so they have no less need of teachers for the
guiding of their souls, Mat. 9. 36, 37, 38. Ephesians. 4. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
Act. 8. 31. Heb. 13. 17. 1 These. 5. 12, 13. 1 Timothy 5. 17. Act. 20. 28, 29.
Math. 28. 19, 20. Phil. 1. 1. and by name of the Elders of the Church, Act. 4.
5. 23. and 11. 3. and 14. 23. and 15. 2, 4, 6, 22, 23. and 16. 4. and 20. 28.
and 21. 18. and 22. 5. Tit. 1. 5. and that the Magistrate should rule the house
of God, is against the word.

Erastus. One Commonwealth can have but one supreme Magistrate, Page 160. 161.
162.
a body with two heads is monstrous, therefore Papists almost by this argument,
do appoint one Pope head of the Church. There cannot be two powers of two
swords, both supreme and of equal power: But the Church power must be subject
to the more excellent, the power of the Magistrate. But because he cannot do
all by himself, he Governs Erastus allows no Government, but Popedom and
Monarchy.
the Schools by Doctors, the Cities by inferior judges, the Church by
Pastors, and all according to right and justice, and the word of God, and that
where the Magistrate and subjects are Christians; but where the Magistrate is
of a false Religion, two different Governments are tolerable.

Ans. 1. This argument destro^eth all Aristocracy, Parliaments, and Senates,
where many good men have equal power, and so the Commonwealth may not have
70. Heads and Rulers of equal power, which is against the Scripture, which
commands subjection to every Civil ordinance of man, as lawful, Romans 13. 1,
2, 3. Tit. 3. 1, 2, 3. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. Deuteronomy. 1. 16. It makes no Government
lawful, but Popedom and Monarchy in both Church and state. 2. It is to beg
the question, that there cannot be two supreme powers, both supreme in their
own kind, for they are both supreme in their own sphere: as Pastors dispense
Sacraments and Word, without subjection to the Magistrate as they are Pastors,
and Magistrates use the Sword without dependence on Pastors, and yet is there
mutual and reciprocal subjection of each to other in diverse considerations:
Pastors as subjects in a Civil relation, are subject to the Magistrate, as
every soul on earth is, and Magistrates as they have souls and stand in need to
be led to heaven, are under Pastors and Elders. For if they hear not the
Church, and if they commit incest, they are to be cast out of the Church, Mat.
18. 1 Cor. 5. Romans 16. 17. 1 These. 3. 14. 15. If they walk inordinately, we are
to eschew their company, if they despise the Ministers of Christ, they despise
him who sent them, Math. 10. 40. Luke 10. 16. God respects not the persons of
Kings, and we finding them not excepted, if the preachers of the Gospel be to
all believers (...) over them in the Lord, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12. 1 Timothy 5. 17. call
it authority, or no Authority, they have some oversight over the Christian
Magistrate; and here be two supreams, two highest powers, one Ecclesiastical,
another Civil; nor should any deny Moses to be above Aaron, as the supreme
judge; Aaron not having the power of the sword, as Moses had, and Aaron must be
above Moses, in sacrificing, in burning incens^*, in judging between the clean
and the unclean, which Moses could not do. 2. The excellency of the Civil
power in regard of earthly honor and eminency in the fifth Commandment, above
the servants of God in the Ministry of Christ's spiritual Kingdom, which is not
of this world, we heartily acknowledge. 3. That the King Preaches and
dispenses the Sacraments by Pastors, as by his servants, is wild Divinty:
Pastors then must have Magistraticall Authority and power of the sword
committed to them, as the Deputies and inferior judges of the Lords of the
Gentiles, which Christ forbade his Disciples, Luke 22. 25, 26, 27. For the
servant must have some power committed to him from the principal cause in that
wherein he is a servant. 4. What reason is there, that where the Magistrate is
a Heathen, two Governments, and so two heads in one body should be? for then
there is and must be a Church Government, where the Magistrate is a Heathen,
and that in the hands of the Church: if then the Magistrate turn Christian,
must he spoil the Church of what was her due before?

Erastus. The Lord Jesus changed nothing in the New Testament p. 162. 163.
of that most wise Government in the Jewish Church, now there all Government
was in the hands of Moses: I say not, that the Magistrate might sacrifice, or
do what was proper to the Priests, but he did dispose and order what was to be
done by the Priests.

Ans. Yea, but Erastus says, the Magistrate may dispense word and Sacraments
in the New Testament, if he had leisure: Why might he not sacrifice in the Old
Testament also? 2. Pastors do by their Doctrine and Discipline, order and
regulate all callings in their Moralls of right and wrong, of just and unjust;
yet is not the Pastor the only Governor in all externals. 3. If Christ changed
nothing of the Jewish Government, we have all their exclusion of men out of the
Camp, their separating of the unclean, and their politic and Ceremonial
Laws, which is unsound Divinity.

Erastus. Moses Ruled all before there was a Priesthood instituted. Page 164.
165. 167.
God, Exodus 4. Numb. 12. calls Aaron to his office and maugurateth him by
Moses; nor does he command him to exercise a peculiar judgment, when he
declares his office to him, and when Aaron dies, Moses substituteth Eleazar
in his place. Joshua c. 3, 4 teaches the Priests what they should do, and
commanded them to circumcise Israel: so did Samuel, David, Solomon, and in the
time of the Maccabees it was so.

Ans. Moses was once a Prophet and Judge both; Ergo, so it may be now, it
follows not, except Moses as a Magistrate did reveal what was the
Priesthood: What Aaron and Eleazer his sons might do, by as good reason
Moses, David, Solomon, Joshua, as Magistrates wrote Canonick Scripture and
prophesied. Then may Magistrates as Magistrates build new Temples typical to
God, give new Laws, write Canonick Scripture, as these men did by the Spirit of
prophecy no doubt, not as Magistrates; for why, but they might sacrifice as
Magistrates, and why should Moses rather have committed the Priesthood, and the
service of the Tabernacle due to him as a Magistrate, so to Aaron and his
sons, as it should be unlawful to him as a King, and unlawful to Vzziah to
burn incense, and to sacrifice, and to do the office of the Priest? If the
Magistrate as the Magistrate do all that the Priests are to do as Priests,
and that by a supreme principle, and radical power in him, he ought not to
cast off that which is proper to him as a Magistrate, to take that which is
less proper, he casts the care and ruling of souls on the Priests, and
reserveth the lesser part to himself, to rule the bodies of men with the Sword,
all these are sufficiently answered before.

Erastus. The King of Persia, Ezra 7. appointed Judges to judge the people and
teach them, but there is no word of Excommunication, or any Ecclesiastic
punishment, but of death, imprisonment, fines; nor did Nehemiah punish the
false Prophets with any other punishment. Josephus speaks nothing of it, nor
Antiochus.

Ans. I show before that there is for^eiting, and separation from the
Congregation, Ezra 10. 8. (...) he shall be separated from the Church. 2. If
the King of Persia appointed men to judge and teach the people, why should he
deny any judicature at all? 3. Where ever Josephus speaks of the judging of
the Priests, as he does antiq. l. 11. c. 7. ant. l. 11. c. 8. l. 12. c. 9. he
hinteth at this.

Erastus. Christ discharges his Disciples to exercise dominion. Page 171.
Christ would not condemn the adulterous woman, nor judge between the
brethren, Luke 12. Paul calls Ministers dispensators, stewards, Peter
forbids a dominion.

Ans. Let Erastus be mindful of this himself, who yet says, that the
Magistrate may both judge, also (if he have time) dispense the Word and
Sacraments; if then the Magistrate by his office may preach and dispense the
Sacraments, who made him a judge and a Ruler? Will this sati^fie men's
conscience; The Magistrate as the Magistrate may play the Minister; but the
Minister may not play the Magistrate: Now as Erastus says, the Minister in
holy things, is his servant called by him; may not the Minister be called by
him to the Bench also? Erastus; Eli and Samuel, were both Priests and Judges,
and so to Erastus they are not inconsistent. 2. Ministers ought not to usurp
the civil sword; Ergo, they have no power of governing by the sword of the
Spirit, it follows not, the contrary is evident, 1 These. 5. 12. 1. Tim. 5.
17. 1 Cor. 12. 28. Romans 12. 7, 8.

Erastus. Peter Martyr says, Com. 1 Samuel 8. Those that live wickedly, may be
corrected by the Magistrate. But Papists give one civil Ecclesiastic power to
the Pope, and another to the Magistrate, whereas the civil Magistrate is
sufficient enough.

Ans. Pet. Martyr 1 Cor. 5. expressly asserteth Excommunication, and
acknowledges a Presbytery of Pastors and Seniors, or Elders, Peter Martyr
condemns the use of both swords in the Pope, and says it is sufficient that
the Magistrate have the Sword. Page 173.


Erastus. Christ says, my Kingdom is not of this world, that is, it is not
pollitick, external, visible, for Christ reigns in the world, but his
Government is invisible, and spiritual in the Word, and the Spirit.

Ans. Christ denies only that his Kingdom is of this World, in Christ's
Kingdom how not of this World.
regard it is not holden up by the civil sword of men, or Magistrates, as
Erastus does dream, who makes the Magistrate with his club to be the only
Catholic and principal Ruler in all Christ's courts; which Christ refuteth,
when he says, If my Kingdom were of this world, mine own would fight for me.
Now Erastus will have no weapon, but the Magistrates sword to hold out, and
cast out all offenders out of Christ's Kingdom; but it is false, that Christ's
Kingdom is not political, external and visible; this is to deny that Christ
has a visible Church: Sure exhorting, rebuking, censuring, withdrawing from
the scandalous, excommunication, are visible externally, and in a politic
spiritual way exercised by Christ in his Ambassadors: for external and
spiritual are not opposed, nor are political and spiritual opposed, as
Erastus dreameth, and therefore this is a non sequitur of Erastus: His Kingdom
is not of this world; Ergo, it is not external.

Erastus. When Pompeius invaded and possessed Judea, and Gabinius Cap. 2. l. 3.
176, 177, 179.
having overcome Alexander, had changed the state of Judea, the Pharisees did
reign wholly at Jerusalem. The Kingly power was removed and Aristocracy set
up, Joseph. bell. Iud. l. 1. c. 6. Joseph. antiq. l. 14. c. 10. (...): The
Synedrie for the most part, had its own authority under Hyrcanus, and under
Archilaus it was more fully restored, as is clear by the Evangelists and
Josephus. Claudius in the tenth year after Christ's death, sets forth an
Edict, (...); Joseph. Ant. lib. 19. Titus Vespasianus promised the same thing
to them.

Ans. Will then Erastus have Christ, Mat. 18. to restore the power of the
Sanedrim, in gaining a lost brother; that is to cite him before the Roman
Judges: But 1. the Romans made high Priests from year to year, did Christ
acknowledge the Sanedrim to be a restored Judicature in this? 2. Say that the
Sanedrim in sacris, in in the holy things of God, had its full power, the
Romans not impeding them; has any man a face to deny, but Pharisees corrupted
both Law, Gospel, Sanedrim and all, and does Christ establish their most
corrupt government; especially when they set themselves against the Messiah?
Caesar or Pompeius could give the Sanedrim no more then it had before they were
subdued; but before they were subdued, the Sanedrim was changed and corrupted.
3. This is to beg the question, to say they kept the power of the Sword: For 1.
We utterly deny that by Gods Law they ever had any such power, and forsooth,
because the Highpriests servant smote our Savior on the face, and they
scourged and imprisoned the Apostles; What then? therefore the Sanedrim had the
Law of God for it, and Aaron and his sons might beat, scourge, imprison, and
kill, as they killed Steven, without Law or warrant, (except the Law that they
had from the Roman Emperors, for which cause I judge their Sanedrim was then a
mixed Judicature,) surely this is a vain consequence. 4. It is like enough
Claudius and Tiberius both, gave them liberty of their own Religion, Ceremonies
and customs at their pleasure, and that is much for us, the adversary so do
reason from a corrupt, unjust and wicked practice to infer a Law.

Erastus. I have solidly proved, there were not two distinct jurisdictions;
Page 179.
but that the Magistrate Governed all. I deny not that the Magistrate took
counsel at those that were skilled in the Law. And I have proved that the
Sanedrim in Christ's time, when he spoke these words, had the power of the
sword, in things pertaining to Religion.

Ans. Let another man praise thee, solidity of the probation to most of
Protestant Divines, is plain emptiness. 2. That the Magistrate took advice of
Divines and learned men skilled in the Law, is not like the first pattern of
Moses, David, Solomon, who as Moses, David, Solomon, appointed to the Priests
nothing in Gods worship as Kings.
Magistrates (says Erastus) did rule all in the Church, gave the Law to Aaron
his sons, directed and commanded the Prophets from the Lord, as nearest to him,
what they should do, what Laws they should teach the people: Show us one
precept, practice, or promise in the word, where Moses, David, Solomon asked
Counsel at Aaron, the Priests, Gad, Nathan, or the Prophets; saying, O sons of
Aaron, O Prophets advise us Magistrates, what Laws we should command you,
touching your office, your holy garments, your washing, your beasts clean and
unclean, your l^per, your putting men out of the Camp, touching the form,
dimensions, structure, materials of the Arc, Tabernacle, Temple, etc. that we
may know what to command you from the Lord; for we are nearer to the Lord, and
have a more eminent place, as Church Officers, then you who are but our Vicars,
Deputies, and servants to be directed by us.

Now 1. Moses received all Laws immediately from God, and never consulted with
any man, either Aaron, Priest, or Prophet; David and Solomon had the form of
the Temple, given to them by the Lord in writing, and advised with none at all;
and therefore received from God, and delivered to the Church, what they
received of the Lord.

2. What warrant the Magistrates should advise with Ministers; what they should
command-Ministers, to preach and do in their Ministry, if by virtue of their
Office they command Ministers.

3. So like as Christ refers men to the Civil sword on their bodies to gain
their souls, which is the scope of Christ, Matthew. 18.

CHAP. XVII.
Quest. 13.
Whether Erastus can make good that the Synedry was the Civil Magistrate?

Erastus. When the Priest accused Jeremiah, Chap. 26. of blasphemy, Erastus l.
4. cap. 4. page 275, 276.
he sat not amongst the Judges, but stood as an accuser before the Magistrate:
So Beza. Erastus replieth, Your Synedry had no Civil jurisdiction, because it
is a dream: 2. Should Pashut the Priest be both accuser and judge? 3. In
Ieremiahs time, there was De Presb. p. 106.
a Monarch, in whose hand was all power; in Christ's time there was an
Aristocracy, the Government being in the hands of some chosen men.

Ans. Certainly, Ier. 26. 10. the Princes sat down in judgment, but that the
Priests sat with them, we have not one word, only the Priests accused him as
worthy to die in the question of Law, and so the people, ver. 8. Now the people
undeniably cannot have been Judges. 2. Nor do we say, the Priests were both
judges The Priests in matters of death, judged only De questione iuris, of the
question of Law.
Civil to condemn Jeremiah to die, and accusers: that does not hinder, but
they in an Ecclesiastical way were Judges, touching the question of Law,
whether he had spoken blasphemy or not, and also Accusers before the Civil
Judges. 3. It is to beg the question to say, that all power even of
Church-censuring was in the hand of the King. 1. The King might exclude none of
the Lepers out of the Camp, the Priests only could by the Law of God do this,
and excluded Vzziah the King, as a Leper out of the Congregation: The King
could not judge who were clean, who unclean. 2. That all power was in the hand
of the Kings, as if the Kings of I^dah were by Gods Law absolute, can never be
proved, but the contrary is evident, Deuteronomy. 17. And that inferior Judges were
essentially Judges, and the Lords immediate Deputies, is clear by Scripture,
Deuteronomy. 1. 16. 2 Chronicles. 19. 5, 6, 7. Exodus 18. 21, etc. Numb. 11. ^6, 17, 18.
Psalm. 82. 6, 7. Romans 13. 1, 2.

Erastus. You ask how Caiaphas, and the Pri^sts had power against Page 276, 277.
Jesus: I answer: 1. From God: 2. From the Kings of Persia. 3. From the
permission of the Romans: They apprehended him, and bound him, which was a part
of Civil power, nor was this some of the confusion under the Maccabees: How
can this be proved? Christ never rebuked it, nor his Apostles; the contrary is
clear in Josephus.

Ans. A permissive power from God, can prove no Law-power. 2. Persians and
Romans could not give to Priests and Levites the power of the sword, to do what
the Law of God had exempted them from doing, they were not so much as numbered
for the war, but set apart for the service of Gods house, Number. 1. 3. 45, etc.
they might in some extraordinary cases judge in civil business with the
Civil Judges in the same Judicature, but this was no standing Law, 2. Erastus
seeks we would prove that the practice of bloody Pharisees was not against
Law: He knows, it is his own Argument, Affirmanti incumbit Probatio. 3.
Christ and the Apostles rebuked not particularly many other sins. Pilate might
have accused them for binding one of Cesars Subjects, of whom he had said, he
found no fault in him. 4. That Joseph was a Priest, or a Levite, I read not,
he was an Honorable Councellor, some think of Pilates Council. 5. That they
had any Law of God to apprehend Jesus, or that Joseph had any hand in either
condemning, or doing any thing in the Sanedrim, but showing his judgment, as a
Judge in the question of Law, what was blasphemy, we must deny, let Erastus
prove it, if so be Erastus make him either Priest or Levite? Ioh. 18. 31. The
Jews expressly deny the power that Erastus gives them: Pilate therefore said
unto them, take him and judge him according to your Law, which was a salt
mocking of them. I know, if you had power, you should not have brought him to
me; therefore if ye have power, use it: The Jews therefore said unto him, It
is not lavvfull for us to put any man to death, and the Evangelist adds, ver.
32. That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying
what death he should die, that is, God had taken power of life and death from
the Jews, in his admirable providence, that Jesus might die a Roman death, due
for treason, that is, that he might be crucified; Ergo, the Jews had no power
to put him to death. It is weak and empty that Erastus says, They had not
power to put him to death, for saying he was King, because that was a civil
crime: But they had power to put him to death, and to stone him for blasphemy;
for the Jews say universally without distinction of causes, with two negations,
which in the Greek Language is a strong and universal negation, (...), We have
not power to kill any man, Ergo, the place will never prove that the Church men
might not kill him, because the Jews might kill no man: you will say, How had
they power with svvords and staves to take the Kings free subject and bind
him, which yet they The Priests and Levites had no Law-power by Gods Law or
from Caesar, to put Christ to death.
did? I answer, it was an usurped power, for by Erastus his doctrine, they had
no more power to take him and bind him for Treason, which was a civil crime,
then they had to kill him for Treason, both was alike unlawful by the Roman
Law, and Pilate being a man willing to please the people, as the event of the
business shows, did not in a legal way challenge them for binding him; but
he durst not be answerable to his Prince Caesar, if he had past by such a high
point, as their putting Christ to death: But we desire any Law of God (for
practices especially of wicked men are no binding rule) that Priests or
Levites, in the Old Testament, might either bind a Jew or put him to death,
and when Pilate did stand so much to put Christ to death, they would have used
their own power, malice so necessitating them, if they had had any, and might
well have said to Pilate, It is lavvfull for us to put him to death for
blasphemy, but we will not use our power, we so love to be loyal to
Caesar; but they say the contrary, We have no power to put any man to death.
They say indeed, that by their law he ought to die. But that they had no power
to put him to death, for the Common people said, that, as may appear, if we
compare, Ioh. 19. ver. 5. with ver. 12. with Matthew. 27. 25. and with Act. 2.
36. Act. 3. 12. etc. and yet Erastus will not say that the common people were
Members of the Sanedrim, or had power of life and death, as the Civil
Magistrate had.

Erastus. Steven was stoned by the Sanedrim, not by tumult, for page 279.
there were vvitnesses, as the law required, Act. 7. The vvitnesses (who by
the law were to cast the first stone at the man condemned) were here,
therefore there was Lavv-povver to stone him, though they did it unjustly.

Ans. Beza meant, that Steven was stoned by tumult, that is, without any
Law-power, except usurped, when the Jews were now riper for destruction, and
had taken on them the blood of the The Sanedrim had no Lawpower against Steven.
Lord of glory, and so growing more daring and insolent against the Roman
power, to their own just desolation, that came on them under Vespasian. That
they used witnesses, will not prove they had Law to stone Steven, for Timothy
had no power of life and death over Elders, one brother has no power of life
and death over another, as Erastus will grant, yet with both there is use of
witnesses, 1 Timothy 5. 19. Matthew. 18. 16. This I hope concludes but weakly, any
lawful civil power, so all this is from a naked practice of those that
alvvayes resisted the holy Ghost: And the like I say of The like is true of
Paul.
Paul, who says Act. 26. 10. of himself, Many of the Saints did I shut up in
prison, having received authority from the high Priests, (...); suppose it were
true that Saul had Law and Authority from the high Priests to imprison the
Saints, and to murder the Saints, no high Priest can make over a Lawpower to
another, which he has not himself; now certain this Law-power of the Pharisees
and High Priests by Gods Law, is the question. Let us see Law or institution,
where the High Priests (for of these only the Text speaks) did imprison and
put to death, either blasphemer or false Prophet, or, if by Moses his Law,
which must be a rule to all the High Priests in the time of persecuting Saul,
it was either Law or practice, that the High Priest had power to imprison, or
scourge, or put to death any man, and this was most proper to the King, and the
Civil judge, and the Elders and Judges in every City, 2 Samuel 1. 14. 15, 16. 1
Kin. 2. 9. and 2. 6, 7. Isa. 1. 23. Ier. 22. 1, etc. Ier. 22. 27. Numb. 35. 12.
24. Deuteronomy. 22. 18. and 7. 5. and 19. 12. 13. ver. 18, 19, 20, 21. and 21. 19. 1
Kin. 21. 11. Hos. 6. 8. Zeph. 3. 1, 2, 3. Romans 13. 4. We know undoubtedly the
King, the Civil Judge, had power of all bodily punishments, as of scourging,
death, stoning, strangling, crucifying, hanging; But show meany Vestigium, or
the least consequence where the Priests or High Priests had such power, or did
execute such power in any one man: it is true, Deuteronomy. 17. the Priests might
determine in Law what was blasphemy, and so what deserved the punishment of
blasphemy, which is death: But so the written Law of God, the very letter of it
could in many cases clearly resolve the Civil judge, even though there had
been no controversy about the fact, whether it was condemned in the Law of
God, or not: we know Samuel not being judge, but Saul being King and supreme
Magistrate, and not executing judgment on the Amalekites, he killed Agag,
certainly, all Divines, even Popish not excepted, say, Saul the Civil
Magistrate ought to have killed Agag, and that Samuel not by virtue of his
place, as a prophet, or as a Priest or a Member of the Sanedrim (as Erastus
would say) but excited by an extraordinary motion of Gods spirit, killed him,
as Phineas the son of Aaron slew, Number. 25. Zimri and Cosbi, 7, 8. And Elijah
slew Baals Priests, 1 Kin. 18. 40. 2 Kin. 1. 10. If Phineas by office, and
Elias by office killed those ill doers, as Erastus would dream, The Prophets
and Priests by their office were Civil Judges, and had power to put to death
evil doers. Now Erastus denies, and with good reason, that the Lords disciples
should bear civil dominion over men, as the Lords of the Gentiles, Luke 22.
24, 25, 26. and that Christ though both a Prophet and a Priest could not take
on him, to be a Judge and a Ruler, Luke 12. yet here Erastus will have the High
Priest, by a Law-power, to imprison and put to death. 2. Erastus may with as
good reason say, that the high Priests had a Law-power by Gods institution to
punish and to compel Christians to blaspheme God, and to persecute them to
strange Cities, and to murder the Saints that believed in the Lord Jesus; for
he went to Damascus for this effect, Act. 26. 12. (...), with power and
Commission from the chief Priests, This was not a Law-power in general, to
punish such as the Law of Moses discerned to be blasphemers, but a limited
particular Commission to murder the Saints, who should hear and obey the
Prophet, like unto Moses, whom the Lord should raise up, Deuteronomy. 18. What Law had
the High Priests for this? Had they not a Law on the contrary? Deuteronomy. 18.

Erastus. Paul confesses ingenuously, before the Roman Page 280.
Judges, that he persecuted the Saints, and that he had authority and power
from the Priests and Elders so to do, Act. 22. and 26. and we read not that the
Priests or Paul were censured for these things, as having done any thing
against the Laws or will of the Romans, Act. 5. They send their Officer, the
Captain of the Temple, they imprison the Apostles, they convene a Council,
give out a sentence, and agitate the killing of the Apostles amongst them,
while Gamaliel impede them.

Ans. It is true, the Romans heard that the Sanedrim exercised Civil
jurisdiction, and inflicted bodily punishment. But for false Doctrine, the
Romans I conceive took as little care as Gallio did of any of Gods matters, and
whether the Sanedrim kept the rule of the Lords first institution, Deuteronomy. 17.
yea, they looked not much whether the Priests might put to death false
Prophets, or if the Civil judges only might do it; and Erastus said before,
that the Romans gave the Jews liberty of all their own laws and customs in
matters of Religion. 2. What care would the Romans take, whether the Jews
killed and oppressed Jews, for questions of their own Religion, so they
remained loyal and true to Caesar? 3. We know Herod, Felix, Festus, Agrippa,
being willing to pleasure the Jews, did oversee many breaches of Law in them,
especially in matters of the Gospel, Act. 12. 3. and 24. 27. and 16. 36, 37,
38, 39 40. Ioh. 19. 15 16, 17. 4. How does he prove that the Romans did not
take this for a breach of their Laws? Because they accuse not the Sanedrim for
this? surely it follows not: We read not that the Romans challenged them for
a manifest breach of Law, when they scourged and cast in prison Paul and Silas,
who were Romans and had not condemned them, Act. 16. 38, 39. 5. We deny not a
lawful judicature of the Sanedrim, Act. 5. But that they had any Law of God,
to scourge, and imprison, and put to death the Apostles, is the question; we
say, they neither had Gods law, nor durst be answerable to the Romans Laws, for
that fact, and so this is a fact brought to prove a Law.

Erastus. If this was insolency in the Jews which rose from the confusion
Page 280. 281.
of the two jurisdictions; how say some of yours, none can be excommunicated
without the consent of the Magistrate? Where did Christ divide the external
Government of the Church in Civil Government and Ecclesiastical, as you
distinguish them?

Ans. 1. That it is expedient, that the Christian Magistrate How the Christian
Magistrate is to be acquainted with excommunication.
should be acquainted with the Excommunication of any under his jurisdiction,
that he may satisfy his own Conscience in punishing him civilly, it is like
some of our Divines do teach: But that the Magistrate have a negative voice in
Excommunication, none of ours teach. 2. We make no such division as that of the
Civil and the Ecclesiastical Government of the Church. Erastus may dream of
such a distinction: We know, all Government of the Church, as the Church, to us
is Ecclesiastical: There is a Government of men of the Church that is Civil;
but we dreamed never of a Civil Government of the Church: All the Government
of the Church, as the Church, though external, is Spiritual, Heavenly, and
subordinate to Jesus Christ as Lord and King of his own house, as the
Government of a house, a Kingdom, an Army, a City is subordinate to the Lord of
the house, to the King, General Commander, and Lord Mayor, and it is no more a
Civil Government subordinate to the Magistrate and his Sword, then Christ's
Kingdom visible and external, or invisible and internal is of this world.

When therefore Erastus denies that there is any Church Government, he means
there is no Spiritual Church Government in the hands of Presbyters; but
because we know no Government of the Church as the Church, but it is
Spiritual, and the Government of the Church by the Christian Magistrate, is a
Civil Government of men as men, and that by the power of the Sword, and so it
is no Church Government at all; and therefore we justly say, that Erastus
denies all Church Government.

Erastus. When Paul says, Act. 23. Thou sit to judge me according Page 281.
to the Law, Does he not acknowledge the High Priest to be his Judge? Paul
denies that he had done any thing contrary to the Law: And Tertullus says, We
would have judged him according to our Law, if Lysias had not without Law
violently taken him from us.

Ans. Ananias was to judge him only in an Ecclesiastical way; and when Paul
saw that they went beyond their line, to take his life, he appealed from their
inferior judicature to Caesar, who only had power of his life. 2. Lysias had
Law to vindicate an innocent man accused on his life, before a most uncompetent
judicature. Tertullus knew the Jews had favor and connivence in many Lawless
Facts.

CHAP. XVIII.
Quest. 14.
Whether Erastus do strongly confute the Presbytery of the New Testament.

BEza says, there was need of same select men in the Apostles time Erastus l.
4. c. 5. c. 6. Beza de presbyter. p. 110.
to lay hands on Ministers, to appoint Deacons, for there was no Jevvish
Synedrie, no Magistrate to do it; and when Paul forbids Christians for
things of this life to implead other before the heathen Magistrate, would he
send them in spiritual business to such? or must that, Tell the Church, have
no use for a hundredth years after Christ? So Beza; yea if the Lord ascending to
heaven left Officers for the A college of churchrulers in the N. T.
building and Governing his Church, Ephesians. 4. 11. and some to be over the people
in the Lord, 1 These. 5. 12. 13. some to watch for their souls, whom they were
to obey, some to feed the flock, and to drive away the wolves, Act. 20. 28, 29,
30. some to Govern the house of God, no less then their own house, 1 Timothy 3.
4. a Presbytery in general Erastus cannot deny, only he denies such a pa. 284.
Presbytery, and says, that it is like this, such a one is a living creature;
Ergo, such an one is a dog. But if I can demonstrate, there is a Presbytery and
they were not all Bishops, as is clear, Romans 12. 89. 1 Cor. 12. 28, 29. 1 Timothy
5. 17. and if, Tell the Church, by no Grammar, can be, Tell the Bishop, except
you make the Queen the Bride, and the servant or friend of the Bridegroom all
one; It must follow there is both a Presbytery, and such a Presbytery in the
Church, nor do we argue from a general to specials.

Erastus. The Church may not kill men, but she may pray that God Page 285.
would destroy them, or convert her enemies.

Ans. To pray that God would destroy him, whom we are to admonish as a brother,
is a strange discipline; Erastus will never make good from Scripture, that God
has appointed praying for the destruction of men to be a saving ordinance,
appointed of Christ for gaining of souls, (such as we take rebuking,
admonishing, excommunication, eschewing the company of scandalous brethren,
which have for their intrinsecall end, the repentance of a brother under these
censures) and therefore this of Erastus his killing of men, is a new forged
censure.

Erastus. Wherever the Scripture speaks in the New Testament Page 286.
of a Presbytery, there is no other understood, but that of preachers;
therefore it is false, that the Apostles have commanded any other Elders beside
those that labor in the word.

Ans. The antecedent is false; 1 Timothy 5. 17. as I have demonstrate in another
place, I repeat it not here, let any disciple of Erastus answer if he can. 2.
The consequence is vain, for if in every place of the New Testament, where
mention is made of an Elder, the Holy Ghost mean only a Preaching Elder, it
follows only that any other officers, as Deacons, and those that labor not
in the Word, and yet Govern well, are not called with the name of Presbyters:
And so the Argument is against the name, not against the office and thing. What
if the Presbytery be named from the most principal part, as is ordinary in
Scripture, does it follow that there be none members of the Presbytery, but
only Preachers of the Word? In no sort. Paul says of the visible Church of
Corinth, Ye are bought with a price, ye are justified, ye are sanctified; Ergo,
none were members of the visible Church, but those that are redeemed,
justified, and sanctified, it is like the consequence of Erastus. 3. I retort
this vain argument thus; none in Scripture have the name of Apostles, But the
Eleven, and Mathias, none are called the witnesses of the Lord but they, 1 Ioh.
1. 1, 2. Ergo, there be no preaching Ministers, neither Timothy, Titus,
Epaphroditus that are to be called witnesses of the Lord, but the twelve
Apostles; so where does Erastus find that (...) a deaconrie or office of
labor in the Ministry is given to any, but to those that labor in the word?
Romans 11. 13. Ergo, must there be no deaconry, but laboring in the word, the
plain contrary is Act. 6.

Erastus. Beside Levites and Priests, there belonged to the pa. 287.
Synedry of the Jews other heads of families; Ergo, beside Ministers there must
be Prophets and Doctors in the Presbytery, it follows not.

Ans. Erastus fancies a conclusion of an Argument that Beza Beza de presbyt. p.
112. 113.
says not; for he says; Ergo, beside Ministers there must be some chief men,
which we call ruling Elders, to represent the people, that there may be (as all
our Divines and Scripture teach) a threefold government in the Church: A
Monarchy, in regard of Jesus Christ the only head and King of the Church, as
the Jewish Church had their High Priest a Type of him; and Aristocracy, in
Pastors and Teachers, as the Jews had their Priests and Levites; and a
Democracy in the ruling Elders, as the Jews had their Zekenim, and their Heads
of families and Elders in the Ecclesiastical Sanedrim, and we in the
Presbytery to represent the people: and of these three the Jewish Ecclesiastic
Sanedrim is made up 2 Chronicles. 19. 8. of the Levites and the priests (...) of the
heads of Fathers, or Masters of families. Now Erastus yields that good
Iehoshaphat departed not from Gods institution in his reformation, all this
Erastus passes over in silence, being ignorant of the Jewish Church
government, and not able to answer, and he adds something of Doctors not to a
purpose, and says there be no Doctors but Pastors only in the Word; contrary
to Romans 12, 7, 8. Ephesians. 4. 11. where they are clearly distinguished.

Erastus. Some chosen men must be in the Presbytery to represent Page 288.
the people; Ergo, these must be Doctors and Prophets, but there is no need of
that, for Bishops of old represented the whole Church.

Ans. Beza has not any such argument, he contendeth for Ruling Beza de
Presbyt. p. 112. 113.
Elders, not for Prophets and Doctors to represent the people. 2. Where does
the Scripture speak of such an office as a Bishop having Majority of power
above Presbyters? (for since Erastus denies all Ecclesiastical Government in
Teachers, he must deny all Majority of Ecclesiastical Government also, he
that denies the positive, denies also the comparative degree) now this is a
Bishop that neither Scripture, nay nor popish Antiquity dreamed of. 3. In what
is a Bishop the representative Church? The like is Erastus his third Argument.

Erastus. 1 Cor. 12. How is Government a Presbytery? how are Overseers Page 289.
and governments, Doctors and Prophets? There be many kinds of Governors. I
wonder that by (...) Miracles, you understand not the power of Excommunication,
that has terrified all the World; how are Doctors and Prophets added to
Pastors, are they not teachers as well as Pastors, but that they administer not
the Sacraments? and how do you prove that? how prove you Overseers to be ^ther
then Ministers?

Ans. Governements to us are but a part of the Presbytery. 2. There be many
kinds of Governors, but he durst not venture to show what is signified by
governments, lest he should say, his Magistrate must be the only Church
Governor, but he knows that a Magistrate as a Magistrate is no member nor
part of the Church, but as he is a Christian; for then Caesar, Herod, Pontius
Pilate, as Magistrates must be set in the body of Christ, as Apostles, and
Teachers and Prophets, which all the World will cry shame on. 3. Beza said
never that Teachers and prophets are cast to Ministers to make a Presbytery,
for by Teachers he means Pastors. 4. Because Paul sets down Governments
different from Apostles, Prophets, and Teachers, they must be some Officers
different from them, we can find none else, but such as rule well, and yet
labor not in the Word, 1 Timothy 5. 17. let Erastus show us what they are, he
dares not open his mind: for he means a Justice of Peace, or a King, or a
heathen judge must be in the womb of this, 1 Cor. 12. 28. let himself be
midwife.

Erastus answering to 1 Timothy 5. 17. says (...) to labor is to page 290. 291.
labor diligently, the meaning is like this; I wish well to all Pastors, but
especially to those who with great industry, fidelity and pains feed the
flock committed to them, as I love all inclined to study, but especially such
as watch night and day upon studies, for some are more diligent in teaching
then others, here is no Tautologie to say, I love all that sincerely and soundly
teach the Word, especially those that diligently teach it.

Ans. I cannot particularly discuss this place, I have done it else Due right
of Presbyteries, qu. 7. c. 7. sect. 7. page 141, 142, 143. seque
where fully (...) with two Articles notes two species of Elders, as Tit. 1.
11. 1 Timothy 5. 8. Gal. 6. 10. Phil. 4. 22. 2. This is a Tautologie, I love all
well governing and faithful Elders, especially those that labor in the word;
they may be well and painful feeding Pastors, who are not painful in preaching
the Word, and this is Tautologie; I love all that are studious, and study
excellently, and especially those that study night and day, as Erastus must
say if he make the phrase agree to the purpose, to feed (...) well in a feeding
Pastor includes laboring in the Word, since Erastus expounds the place, 1 Timothy 5. 17. of Church officers, he cannot deny but the place holds forth a
Government, and a (...) of Church Officers, for beside laboring in the Word
and doctrine, which is preaching, here is well governing, it is a shame then to
Erastus to expound this place so, and yet deny all Church Government, except in
the hands of the Magistrate.

Erastus. Ancient and modern Doctors deny two sorts of Elders.

Ans. I have made the contrary appear in the place cited; I will not weary the
Reader with reasons set down at full in another place.

Erastus. Show where the Church has a judicature, to punish sins different
from the Magistrates judicature, as the Lord made a power of burning incense to
the Lord, to be different from the Kings royal power.

Ans. Mat. 18. Mat. 16. Ioh. 20. Mat. 28. 19, 20. Ephesians. 20. 28. 1 Cor. 5. 1, 2*
etc. Rev. 2. 1, 2. and 20. 21. Ministers are no less separated under the New
Testament to all ministerial acts of feeding, by the word and rod of
Discipline, then Priests were of Old.

Erastus. Nathan did not Excommunicate David. page 293.


Ans. Nathan had assurance from God that his sin was pardoned; 2. That the
Sanedrim did not cast David out is a fact, and proves not they had no power;
for 80. Priests cast Vzziah out of the house of God for a less fault, that
carried in its face less scandal.

Erastus. The Prophets never accuse the Priests, that they admitted the unclean
to the sacrifices and holy things of God.

Ans. The contrary is evident, Ier. 5. 31. Ezekiel. 22. 25, 26. and 44. 8, 9, 10.
contrary to their Office, Deuteronomy. 17. 11, 12. Levit. 10. 10.

Erastus. David Psalm. 51. shows he would have given Sacrifices, page 294.
but God craved a broken heart; Ergo, he had power to sacrifice.

Ans. Not except withal he had offered a contrite heart to God.

Paul (says Erastus) speaks of coming to them with the rod, of Erastus l. 4.
c. 7. p. 295. 296.
delivering to Satan, of his coming with the authority God had given him, of
his coming to them mourning.

Ans. Where says Paul that he his alone did use the rod? does he not ascribe
judging and casting out to the Corinthians? 1 Cor. 5. 12. etc, and forgiving of
the incestuous man 2 Cor. 2. to them Beza says, this power is necessary to
purge the Church, lest it be infected; even to the end of the world, and
therefore must be left with the Church. page 296.


Erastus. To be gathered in the Name of the Lord is not referred to the
congregations meeting together, but to Paul's act of delivering to Satan, the
Corinthians and Paul's Spirit instructed thus with the power of Christ, might
have delivered others to Satan as they did this man, if the Apostle had not
pardoned them, but they had not Paul's spirit with them in their convention
afterward, because in no place he bids them be gathered together with his
Spirit, as he does here.

Ans. Paul does construe the words v. 4. in the Name of Christ with the
Participle (...) ye being conveened, and the words (...), are separated from
the word (...) ( I have judged) by the interposition of these words, (...) so
Erastus his grammar will be a little confused. 2. What needed the Corinthians
be gathered together with the Spirit of Paul, and the power of the Lord Jesus
to pray that the man might be miraculously No miraculous killing 1 Cor. 5. or
tormenting of the man's body.
killed? for when they were not gathered together in a Church meeting, but were
all separatim in their own houses and closets, they had power to judge the man,
that is, to pray that he might be miraculously killed, else Erastus cannot make
Paul, in any reasonable manner to rebuke them because they prayed not that he
might be killed, for Erastus must suppose the power of praying; for this, in
faith, was tied to this public convention of the Church, and Erastus says, in
no place he bids them be gathered together as here. This Spirit of Paul and
power of the Lord Jesus that was in them, was not given to elevate them to any
higher or more supernatural acts of miraculous cooperating with Paul, then
their naked act of consenting that the man should be cut off, and this act of
consenting, they could not want, in their private praying at home, that the man
be miraculously killed, and so this spirit of Paul, and the power of the Lord
Jesus shall be brought so low, as I know not what to make of it.

Erastus. If they had prayed that God would punish this enormous sin, whether
God had heard them or not, they had discharged Page 296.
their duty.

Ans. But it is evident he rebukes them not only, for not mourning for the
man's fall, and not praying that he might be punished; but for that they
conveened not, and did not judge, and put away the man; Ergo, they had always
an ordinary power to judge and cast out scandalous persons, and Paul rebukes
them for not improving this power; then it was not any miraculous power not
ordinarily in their hand, as powers of that kind are supposed to be.

Erastus says, (...) is to be construed with (...); pa. 297.
as the meaning may be; note such a one in an Epistle, and write to me, that I
may censure him.

Ans. This is thrown Grammar, which the Greek does not bear without violence,
for Paul says, If he obey not our doctrine, written by Epistle, mark such a
one, and he commands them to inflict a censure on him, by eschewing his
company.

CHAP. XIX.
Quest. 15.
Of the use of Excommunication toward the Magistrate especially. Lib. 5. c. 1.
Erast. 298.


Erastus. How many thousands of men have been killed by occasion of
Excommunication in Germany? it has subjected Kings and Scriptures, and all to
the Pope.

Ans. All this may be said of the Gospel and of Christ, that he is appointed
for the fall and ruin of many, and that he came not to give Peace, but the
Sword, 1 Pet. 2. 8. Luke 2. 34. Mat. 10. 34, 35. But the cause is not in the
Gospel, or in Christ, but in men's corrupt nature: Excommunication is the Rod
of the King out of Zion, and we know how impatient men are of the yoke of
Christ; Excommunication abused by the Pope does all this.

Erastus. Excommunication cures not wounded consciences, but begets page
299.
Hypocrites.

Ans. So public rebuking of those that sin publicly, 1 Timothy 5. 20. being
abused does beget Hypocrites, Esa. 57. 1, 2, 3. Ezekiel. 31, 32, 33. 1 King. 21.
27. 28, 29. so does the Rod, the Word, the giving of alms, praying, being
abused to wicked ends, make hypocrites, Mat. 23. 14, 25. Mat. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Psalm. 78. v. 34, 35, 36. Hos. 7. 14. Excommunication is innocent of all these.

Erastus. I think it not amiss that the Magistrate choose godly and page 29^.
prudent men, and join to them godly Ministers, who in place of the Magistrate
may inquire in the life and manners of men, and convene before them loose
livers, and rebuke them, and if need be, defer them to the Magistrate; But
this is unjust, that such a Senate be chosen by the Church, which has no power
to choose them. 2. That they are not chosen in the Name of the Magistrate, but
against his will. 3. That they subject the Magistrate to them.

Ans. Erastus is willing there be a Presbytery: 1. Of mixed men, prudent men,
and godly Pastors. 2. Chosen by the Magistrate. Erastus yields there is a
Presbytery.
3. That they judge and rebuke Murderers, Extortioners, Oppressors, Thieves,
etc. But 1. he should give us Scripture for this his new Presbytery. He
condemns ours, because it wants (as he says) the Authority; and the like
of his Presbytery in the Old or New Testament you find not. 2. That Ministers
should judge of bloods, thefts, treasons, paricides (for all these are loose
livers) and of goods and inheritances, and give an account to the Civil
Magistrate, is all one as if the Ministers of the Gospel should be Judges as
the Lords of the Gentiles, such as Pilate, Foelix and the rest, so they do it
at the Command of the Supreme Magistrate; then the King may warrant Ministers
to go against the Command and practice of Christ, Luke 22. 24, 25, 26. and 12,
13, etc. 2 Timothy 2. 4. For this is a Civil Judicature. 3. Then the Ministers
rebuking in the name of the Civil Magistrate, may make him to Preach and
exhort in the name of the Civil Magistrate. So Ministers, are they to hear the
word at the Magistrates mouth? I thought Ministers had been the Ambassadors of
an higher King, Ezech. 2. 7, 8. and 3. 3. Speak with my words to them, Romans 1.
1. 2 Cor. 5. 20. 4. If the Ministers rebuke as Ambassadors of Christ: Those to
whom they Preach the word of reconciliation, those they are to rebuke with
Authority, and all hearers are subject to them: Magistrates or others, The
Magistrate under Church discipline.
high or low: This is clear by 2 Cor. 5. 19. 20, etc. 2 Timothy 4. 1, 2. For
rebuking in way of Preaching, or in way of censure, is a part of the Gospel.
But Pastors are to Preach the Gospel to all, to great and small who stand in
need of Reconciliation, 2 Cor. 5. 20, Act. 9. 15. He is a chosen vessel to me,
to bear my name before Gentiles and Kings, and the Children of Israel.

Erastus. It is false that the Sword of the Magistrate is not sufficient to
coerce sins, Psalm. 101. Kings have put to death those that seek not God: It is
nothing that you say, the Priest judged those same sins in a spiritual manner,
that the Magistrate judged politically; for it is false, that the Priests
judged in a Judicature separated from the Civil Judges, as your Presbytery
sits. See Levit. cap. 4. 5. 6. God seems to have given no Laws of
punishing offenders by themselves, as with us, least we should imagine two
distinct Judicatures.

Ans. We deny not, but the Sword is sufficient to punish offenders, in its own
kind, in order to the peace of the Commonwealth. to remove evil; to cause
others fear, to pacify Gods wrath, as the Scriptures speak: so David and good
Kings purged the city of God, but Erastus cannot deny but God ordained
spiritual means of rebukings, putting out of the Camp, eschewing the company
of offenders, that they may be ashamed, and those spiritual means have a
spiritual influence on the soul to remove offenses, to gain the offenders,
Matthew. 18. 15. Psalm. 110* 2. Isa, 11. 4. Psalm. 141. 5. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 14, 15.

2. The word makes the Priests separated from Civil Judges, Zach. 3. 7. The
Angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua the high Priest, if thou will walk in
my ways, and keep my charge, then thou shall also judge my house, and thou
shall keep my courts. The Civil Magistrate judged not the house of God, the
way that the High Priest did. The Divines that notes on the place, say, The
chief part in Ecclesiastical affairs was upon the High Priest, Deu^. 17.
Annot. on the Bible, An. 1645. in Zach. 3. 7.
12. 2 Chronicles. 19. 11. The word (...) that is given to the Priest is to judge,
to give out sentence in judgment, the very word that is given to King Josiah;
He judged the cause of the poor and needy, and Ier. 5. 28. They judge not the
cause, the cause of the fatherless, and Ier. 21. 12. O house of David execute
judgment in the morning, and the sons of Aaron the Priests, 1 Chronicles. 24. 5.
are made some of them Governors of the sanctuary, and Governors of the house of
God: It is the word that signifies Princes, 2 Kin. 9. 5. A word to thee O
Prince (...), 1 Samuel 22. 2. 1 Chro. 11. 6. Ier. 17. 25, Number. 23. 3. 10. All the
princes of Moab, Isa. 30. 4. Isa. 10. 8. Are not my princes Kings? and Lev. 4.
5, 6. chapters, judicial acts are given to the Priest that are proper to him
as Priest, which none do but he, nor have the Civil ludges any part in it,
more then they can offer sacrifices A judicature proper to the priests as
priests.
which none do but the priests, for he was to judge of the quality of the sins,
and might not offer any sacrifice for every sin, nor dip his finger in the
blood of the bullock seven times, for every sin, this spiritual judicature was
the Priests. And neither Moses the Prince nor any Civil Judge on earth could
share with the Priests in judging this: all the world will say the judge may
use the sword against the Murderer, and Elders or Pastors have not to do with
the sword at all: and the Pastors are to convince, rebuke and work upon the
conscience of the Murderer to gain him to repentance, and no civil judge as a
civil judge has to share with him in this: here be distinct punishments, one
corporal and civil, another spiritual, why then must they not flow from two
distinct Jurisdictions? or if it displease any man, that we call Churchcensures
with the name of punishment, we can forbear the name, for rebukes, suspension
from the Sacraments, Excommunication, because they are intrinsecally, and of
their own nature such as tend not to the hurt, but to the gaining and saving of
the souls of the persons censured; they are unproperly punishments, as the
power and court they come from is unproperly a rod a Judicature, a Court, and
those that inflict the censures improperly Judges, yet can it not be denied to
be spiritual Government, and that there is a spiritual sword, the word of
God, and a spiritual coaction, flowing from Heralds, or servants in the name
of the King of Kings and Head of the Church, who reigns in his own
Ordinances, and Ministers.

Erastus. The priests bade Uzziah not burn incense, because it was Page 300.
their part only to sacrifice: But where is it written that the King was
condemned by the sentence of the Priests?

Ans. The Priests were a College of Elders, who not only judicially condemned
the Kings fact as against the Law of God, but 2 Chronicles. 26. Azariah and eighty
priests with him withstood him, and resisted him, yea, they gave out sentence
against him, ver. 18. It pertains not unto thee, Vzziah, to burn incense to
the Lord, but to the Priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn
incense; go out of the sanctuary, for thou have trespassed, they give out the
sentence of the Law of God, Numb. 16. 40, Nor might any come in to the Holy
place, but the Priests and Levites, Number. 18. 6, 7. here is a sentence judicial
by the voices of 80. Priests in an external court, given out against the
supreme Magistrate: for they gave not out this sentence as private men, but as
Priests, judging according to the Law, and in this the King was subject to
Ecclesiastical jurisdiction.

Erastus. It is a vain thing to say, they Excommunicate not the Page 301.
Magistrate as the Magistrate, none but Kata-baptists and such as deny
Magistracy to be an Ordinance of God, can say that: Every man might excuse
rebellion so, and say, I persecute not the Magistrate as he is a Magistrate,
but as he is a tyrant: But I say you may not reproach the Magistrate, Exodus 22.
far less may you punish him. How can I obey him, whose whole life and
actions, I may by Power, and coaction limit? The Magistrate so is but a servant
to the Presbytery.

Ans. Erastus scorneth this distinction, to say, the Magistrate not as a
Magistrate, but as a scandalous man is Excommunicated: Yet we can make him
receive the distinction whether he will or not: For Erastus says, that Pastors
may rebuke, convince, and threaten the Magistrate? Good man, may Pastors
threaten and rebuke the Page 300. Erastus, Quis unquam dubitavit, an Ministris
liceat improbe age^tes, Magistratus, ex verb^ Dei, objurgare, arguere,
reprehendere, increpare, adeoque solvere and ligare?
Magistrate as the Magistrate? or may they only threaten, and rebuke him as an
offending man? Erastus dare not say the first, for so he were a gross
Kata-baptist, for then Pastors were to rebuke the very office, and to condemn
it; if he say the latter, as he does in express words, then he acknowledges
that Pastors may bind the sins of wicked Magistrates in heaven, is this, good
Thoma, no Ecclesiastical coaction, no jurisdiction? and this is to receive the
distinction whether you will or not. 2. The rejecting of this distinction is a
tenet of Royalists, for certainly we use no defensive arms against the King as
King, but as he is a misled man; and I think the King will say, he uses not
offensive arms against the Parliament as the Parliament, but under another
very undeserved notion, as Rebels. 3. It is less that we may not rail on
rulers, which is a sin, (for to rail upon any cursing-wise is unlawful) then
that we cannot punish the ruler, which is more? To punish the ruler as a
sinful and wicked man, is a work of justice, and so less unlawful then sin.
Erastus takes for confessed (as his custom is) that which we deny, that to
punish rulers with an Ecclesiastic censure is a sin, as to rail on them, and
curse them is a greater sin. But to bind the rulers sins in heaven, is a
punishment, and this the Elders may lawfully do, and to eschew the company of a
ruler, if he be a fornicator, an extortioner, and idolater, is either to punish
him, or put shame upon him, 2 These. 3. 14. But one private Christian, far
more a Church may do that, Romans 16. 17. 1 Cor. 5. 9, 10. 2 These. 3. 14. except
Erastus except the Magistrate from being under a Divine and Apostolic command;
this he must say, and so we have the Apostles meaning; withdraw from those that
cause divisions, and walk unordinately, and are fornicators, coveteous,
extortioners, least they infect you, and that they may be ashamed, and repent,
except they be Magistrates, though in the lowest rank; if they be Magistrates,
they are gods, and you their subjects, and you may in no sort shame them. I
should think God both accepted persons, and would not have us to endeavor the
repentance and gaining of the souls of Magistrates, because they are above
Gospel-rules by this way of Erastus; and because the Presbytery may not rail on
Magistrates, for that is sin, it follows not, the Presbytery may inflict no
Ecclesiastical censure on them; Yea, let me retort this, The Magistrate may
not rail on, or curse and revile the Priests; So Paul expounds it, Act. 23.
5. against reviling of Priests, nor may the Magistrate revile or curse any
subject, for I conceive reviling to be sin, Mat. 5. 11. and 27. 39. Joh. 9.
28. 1 Cor. 4. 12. 1 Pet. 2. 23. 1 Cor. 6. 10. Isai. 51. 7. Zepha. 2. 8. 1 Pet.
3. 9. Jude 9. and the Magistrate is under the Moral Law. Hence I infer by
Erastus his reasoning, that the Magistrate may not punish, Priests, Prophets,
Pastors, or any subject, though they most hainously trespass against all
Laws, which is absurd. 3. That the Magistrate is made a servant, not a
Magistrate, if the Elders may use the rod of Christ against him is a vain
consequence; Paul preached himself a servant, in a spiritual Ministry, to all
the Christians in Corinth, 2 Cor. 4. 5. and all Elders are thus servants to
Magistrates and flock; Yet Erastus knows that Paul had a rod of miraculous
killing the disobedient, as Erastus expounds, 1 Cor. 5. and 1 Cor. 4. 21.
What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love? Suppose there had
been a Christian Magistrate at Corinth that should fall in incest, as one did,
1 Cor. 5. 1. Paul could not come to him with the rod; or suppose the Roman
Emperor had been a Christian and within the Church, and should have his
Fathers wife; Paul could use no rod against him, and should he not have in
readiness revenge against all disobedience? 2 Cor. 10* 6. and authority,
(...), given him by the Lord for edification, v. 8. against all offenders
within the Christian Church? in regard that Christ is head and King of the
Church; but he should have neither rod nor revenge in readiness against the
disobedience of the Emperor? why, is not the rod of Paul the rod of Christ? 2
Cor. 10. 8. yea certainly, is not then the Christian Emperor the subject of
Christ's Kingdom? and subject to the King Christ, and his rod? No but (says
Erastus) Paul, Is the Emperor subject to thee? and if Paul should have a rod
to punish the Emperor, then the Apostle could not be the Emperors subject,
nor obey him as a God on earth: for (says Erastus,) no subject may punish the
Magistrate. This is down right to make God an accepter of persons, nor can
Erastus deny but sharp rebuking was a punishment, Tit. 1. Rebuke them sharply
that they may be sound in the ^aith; And this the Apostle urges all Ministers
and watchmen to do, not being afraid of the faces of Kings, Iere. 1. 17, 18.
Joh. 2. 1, 2, 3* 4. 2 Timothy 4. 1, 2, 3. Erastus teaches Magistrates to break
Christ's bounds, and to say, we will not have this man to reign over us, he
needed not employ a wicked pen for this, they need no teacher, vitia discuntur
sine Magistro.

Erastus. Some of yours say, there is need of the Magistrates consent Page 302.
303. How the Magistrates consent is requisite in Excommunication.
to Excommunication, but certainly he will never consent to be Excommunicated
himself, Theodosius was not willing, nor will good Magistrates consent, when
they see the danger on themselves, you would not bring in again the
Church-penances of the ancients.

Ans. 1. We all think the Cumulative consent of the godly Magistrate, is
necessary to Excommunication: Because he is obliged to join his sanction and
authority to all Christ's Ordinances, but we think not the privative, or
negative consent is required; so as no man's sins should be bound in heaven,
except the Magistrate say Amen. 2. Put Erastus his Arguments in form, and you
shall see their weakness as thus: He whose consent is required to
Excommunication, cannot be punished with Excommunication himself, because no
man will consent, not Theodosius, nor the godliest man, that he be punished
himself: But the Magistrates consent (say the Presbyterians) is to be had to
Excommunication; Ergo, the Magistrate cannot be punished with Excommunication
himself.

Ans. I retort it, he whose consent is required for threatening wrath ^o, and
rebuking of offenders and scandalous men, he is not to be threatened with wrath,
and rebuked for his own offenses and scandals; because no man, no Theodosius,
no godly Magistrate, when he sees the present danger, will consent, that he be
threatened with the wrath of God and rebuked himself; We know Nathan was afraid
to rebuke a Magistrate according to Gods heart, but in the third Person. But
Erastians teach that the Magistrate, when he scandalously offends, should be
threatened and rebuked; Ergo, the Magistrates consent is not requisite to
threatenings and rebukings of Pastors. But the conclusion is against Erastus,
for the Pastors preach, and rebuke, and threaten as the deputies and servants
of the Magistrate, and as sent by him; and the Magistrate preaches, rebukes,
threatens all offenders, and himself also in and through Pastors as his
servants, as Erastus teaches; then he must consent, that they threaten and
rebuke himself. 2. The proposition is false, it is presumed, all the subjects
do consent to lawful penal Laws against sorcery, murder, incest in the
general, and virtually, that they shall be put in execution against
themselves: yet the Sorcerer will never formally consent, that he himself be
put to death, though he once, as a subject, consented to the Law, that all
Sorcerers be put to death: For when the penal Law against sorcery was enacted,
he consented to this. 3. He whose consent accumulative is requisite, that
scandalous offenders in general be Excommunicated, but not that this or this
man, possibly the Magistrate himself, he is not to be Excommunicated, is most
false; he whose consent negative, is requisite for Excommunication, he is not
to be Excommunicated himself, the proposition is true; But I assume, the
Magistrates consent negative, is requisite to Excommunication, there is nothing
more false: For shall that which the Church binds on earth, not be bound in
heaven, except the King, the Justice, or Master Constable say Amen to it on
earth? We say not that the Magistrates consent as a Magistrate, is requisite,
for the Excommunicating of himself. For though as a Magistrate he ought to
give his consent to Excommucate all offenders, and add his civil sanction, as
one of the seven wise men of Greece said, Patere legem, quam ipse tuleris. Yet
he is not Excommunicated as a Magistrate (except with Kata-baptists, you
condemn the Office of Magistracy as an unlawful Ordinance) but as a
scandalous man. 3. The old penances, as they do us that service to make good
that Excommunication was in the ancient Church, and that Erastus wants the
authority of the Fathers, and upon his ingenuity should have been ashamed to
cite them for his way, so we condemn them as introductory to Popery; but let
Erastus form an Argument from this, and logic shall his^e at it. That which
brings in old satisfactions and penance, is not to be holden. But
Excommunication, or the Excommunicating of Magistrates does this; Ergo, The
assumption must be proved.

Erastus. It has no more truth which you say, that the Magistrate, Page 302.
The Magistrates sword no kindly mean to gain souls, as Erastus dreameth.
while he punishes, cures not the conscience, for God calls many by
tribulations to himself, and far more then by your Excommunication.

Ans. I would Erastus had drawn up an Argument, which seldom he does, for
this it must be:

That which is a saving mean to gain scandalous offenders to Jesus Christ, and
better then Excommunication, is an Ordinance of God, and the other no
Ordinance; But the Magistrates punishing with the sword the scandalous
offenders, is a saving mean to gain scandalous offenders, and better then
Excommunication; Ergo,

Ans. Neither Major nor Minor proposition has any truth at all. 1. Though the
Magistrates sword were a better mean to gain souls, it follows not that
Excommunication is no mean. The Law is less powerful for gaining souls, The
Gospel more powerful. But the Law is not for that no Ordinance of God. 2.
Erastus his reason to prove, that the Magistrates punishing cures the
conscience, as a saving Ordinance, no less then Excommunication, must be this;
That, by which God calls, and draws many to himself, is a saving mean, to
cure the conscience; but by the Magistrates punishing of scandalous men, God
does this as by other tribulations. The proposition must be, a propositio per
se; That by the Magistrates heading, and hanging, scourging, and imprisoning of
themselves, as kindly and intrinsecally saving means, such as rebukes,
promises, commands, excommunication are, the Lord calls men, and converteth
them, that is false, God no more uses the Sword of the Magistrate, as a kindly
mean of gaining souls, then the sword of an oppressing Tyrant; so
Nebuchadnezzars oppressing of the Church of God, and the Assyrians unjust
wasting of the people of Israel, shall be kindly means of gaining of souls;
because God blessed the rod to many to humble their uncircumcised heart; but
this is accidental to, and beside the nature of the rod: but it is not
accidental to rebuking, threatening, promises to the preaching of the Gospel,
nor to Excommunication to save souls and gain them to Christ. The Gospel, and
all the parts of it, are kindly, and of themselves the Romans 1. 16.
power of God to salvation: The Magistrates sword to Erastus must be the power
of God to salvation, and Christ, Matthew. 18. in his order of gaining an
offending brothers soul, by this reason must descend, not ascend, contrary to
the order of Christ, for Christ makes the rebuking between brother and
brother, to be the first step of gaining an offender to Christ. 2. The rebuking
before two or three. 3. Before the Church. 4. Excommunication: Now all these
are spiritual means and more efficacious, the second then the first, the third
then the second, the fourth then any of them. But Erastus makes Christ in the
fourth step, to descend from three spiritual steps of gaining the man's soul,
to a fourth, which is carnal, to wit, let him be as a heathen, etc. this is
Caesar's sword, which certainly is a carnal weapon, proper to the Kingdoms of
this world, Ioh. 18. 36. whereas rebuking, exhorting, promises, and
Excommunication, are the spiritual weapons of the warfare of the Ministers of
Christ, 2 Cor. 10. 4, 8, 9. Rev. 1. 16. Esai 11. 4. Psalm. 45. 4. Romans 1. 16.
The exercise of the sword is a mean of edifying consequenter by removing false
teachers, that hinders edification; but no man can say it is a mean of it
self, and kindly in regard of the man against whom the sword is used; Farther,
that which is a common mean of conserving peace in all societies and
corporations, even without the Church, where the Gospel was never heard, cannot
be a kindly mean of gaining men's souls that are within the visible Church.

Erastus. Ambrose following the example of Azariah, cannot be defended L. 5. c.
1. p. 302. 303.
in debarring Theodosius from the Sacraments; Yea, it was tyranicall and
damnable to debar a man desirous to hear the word, who otherwise repented
and acknowledged his fault, from the means of salvation. It was like the Popes
proud fact in trampling ^on the Emperors neck* he had no cause of wrath
against Theodosius, but as Nicephorus says, the Emperor hated Ambrose.

Ans. 1. If Erastus had come to Logic, he refuteth here but a Law by a fact of
Ambrose. 2. What if Ambrose debarred Theodosius from hearing the word; Ergo,
there is no Excommunication, it follows not. 3. That he debarred Theodosius
from the Sacrament, after he gave evidences of his repentance to the Church, is
an untruth. 4. That after such a cruel fact of murdering so many innocent
persons of Thessalonica, Theodosius should have been admitted to the Sacrament,
or remained a Member of the Church, to eat and drink his own damnation, and
not be cast out, as 1 Cor. 5. no man but Erastus could say: so it is clear,
that Ambrose did no more then a faithful Pastor, and Amariah and the 80.
valiant Priests did, in not suffering the holy things of God to be polluted;
Lipsius, no religious man, says, l. 2. c. 24. de Constantia, quo facto nihil
magis impium omnis ve^us impietas habuit. Beza, Bucer, P. Martyr, Melancton,
Calvin, Anto. Waleus, Gomaras, commend Ambrose. And truly to kill seven
thousand Citizens of Thessalonica, of which the most part were innocent,
deserved more then Excommunication, if more could be inflicted by the Church.
See Ambrose, Epist. 5. 28, 29. Erastus had no reason to compare so laudable a
fact to the proud fact of an abominable Pope trampling on the Emperors neck,
and abusing the word of God, Psalm. 91. to defend his devilish pride.

CHAP. XX.
Quest. 16.
A vindication of other Arguments for Excommunication, as from sacrificing,
offering of gifts, etc. with bloody hands.

Erastus. Esaias 1. c. 52. c. 66. Ier. 6. 7. Ezech. 23. and 33. Page 303. 304.
Psa. 50. are alleged for Excommunication, to which I answer, 1. The Lord does
not condemn sacrificing, for he commanded it, but the abuse thereof, as he
that commends modesty to one that eats undecently, does condemn
unmannerly eating; but commands not abstinence from eating; so Christ Mat. 6.
removes not fasting and praying, but the abuse of them. When the Hebrews
propound two just and right things, of which they approve the one, and deny the
other, there is only a comparison understood, as Hos. 6. I will have mercy, and
not sacrifice, that is, rather mercy then sacrifice, Prove. 8. Receive my
instruction, and not silver, that is* receive rather my instruction then
silver: so this is no good consequence. God hates the sacrifice of the wicked;
Ergo, Presbyters are to be chosen, who should hinder wicked men to sacrifice:
it follows not, for then this should be as good a consequence; God hates the
prayers of the wicked; Ergo, Presbyters are to be chosen, who should hinder men
to call upon God, to praise God, to rest on the Sabbath, to give alms, except
these Presbyters judge them worthy.

Ans. In the following books, Erastus refuteth some Treatises of Authors
without names, the books I cannot have, and if he do them right in repeating
their mind faithfully, I know not; but I know in many things, and in this very
argument Erastus fancied arguments on Beza, which he would reject as none of
his. 1. Sacrificing seems to be a confirming ordinance, as eating the
Passover, and the Communion of the Lords body and blood; and as there was
some examination of the persons for whom sacrifices were offered required in
the Priests, as I said before, from Mat. 8. 4. Levit. 14. 3, 4. 9, 10, 11, 12.
So there is Moral cleanness required in all that are to partake of the
Sacraments, that presupposes conversion; and I grant the first and native
consequence of these is, that it was the sin and hypocrisy of the persons
themselves who sacrificed first and principally. But that it was not the sins
of the Priests who admitted those that were no better then Sodom and Gomorrah
Esa. 1. 10. and had hands full of blood, ver. 15. is now the question; I
conceive that it is a taxing of the Priests and Church Rulers, that is, Esa. 1.
10. no less then of civil judges and the people, yea, that he rather taxes
the Priests called Rulers, v. 10. and that that is not as Socinians say, a new
commandment of Christ, but an old, Mat. 5. 23. Therefore if thou bring thy
gift unto the Altar, and there remembrest that thy brother has ought against
thee? What if the Priest should know that he had killed an innocent man, and
beside the guilt of innocent blood, that the sad hearted widow, and the weeping
Orphans had any blood to charge him withal, was the Priest either to offer or
sacrifice for him, while he were reconciled to the widow and fatherless?
Christ adds v. 24. Leave there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way,
first (...) be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy gift: I
offer it to the consideration of the Reader, if as the offerer of the gift was
to leave his offering, knowing himself to be under blood, and to have offended
his brother, he was to leave his offering at the Altar, so if the Priest who
offered the same should also know that the same day he had offered his child
to Molech or the Devil; if the Priest in this case should offer for him, and
if the Priest should not eat this man's sin, and communicate with the bloody
impenitent man in offering with him, and for him the sacrifice of fools; if he
should not leave offering for him till he went and was reconciled with his
brother, for the Priest by office was to forbid such a bloody man to offer;
Ergo, he could not by office, also offer for him. Here an order prescribed that
is moral, perpetual, and common both to the ordinances of the Old and New
Testament, for Christ does here expound the Law, which was corrupted by the
Pharisees. 2. He does not set down a rule concerning the Ceremonial Law, which
was shortly to be abrogated, but sure he has an eye to the worship of the New
Testament. What if he that is come to the Table to eat and drink with Christ,
and both his own conscience and the Elders remember the widow and orphane
have a just accusation against this man of late, yesterday, he killed their
husband and father, should either this man eat and drink at this time with
Jesus Christ? or should the Elders give these holy things to him? I think no^.
And to come to the argument, it is true, Isa. 1. sacrificing is not condemned,
but sacrificing by such Princes of Sodom and tali modo, by men of bloody
hands; Ergo, they were not to abstain from sacrificing, but at that time and
in that condition; nor do we forbid either coming to, or debarring from the
Lords Table by the Elders, but only haec vice, and only while (...) first he
be reconciled to his brethren, and testify that he repents, we never
heighten Excommunication to such an extremity, as it does totally unchurch the
man, and exclude him from the Seals simpliciter and absolutely, but according
to Christ's (...) and his order, and therefore the Elders are to exclude for a
time just as this, God will have mercy and not sacrifice, that is, rather
mercy, first mercy, and first faith and repentance; then sacrifice, that is,
then afterward external worship, afterward receiving of the Passover, the
Lords Supper, and offering of gifts at the Altar: And secondarily even in the
second place, in regard of time, he will have all these externalls, whence the
man is to debar himself, and by the same reason the Elders as the 80.
Priests did to a King, 2 Chronicles. 26. are to debar the man while he repent: And
2. This also; I will have mercy, and not Sacrifice, or, I will have mercy
rather then Sacrifice, does imply that both mercy and Sacrifice are lawful,
and acceptable to God in their own order and way. But where says God, I will
have sacrificing rather then sacrificing with bloody hands, so as both
sacrificing, and sacrificing with bloody hands, shall be lawful and acceptable
to God in their own order? for Sacrificing with bloody hands was never
lawful, never acceptable to God in any order. Nor said God ever he would choose
the coming of those to his Sanctuary, who the same day they came in had
slaughtered their sons to Molech: God always hated it, and never chose it,
if at the same time both mercy and sacrifice cannot be, as David starving
cannot both abstain from eating shewbread, as the Law in its letter required,
and show mercy to his life; and the life of his followers, and eat, yea, he
is to eat, and the Priests knowing his case, do give him the Shewbread to
eat, and forbid abstinence, as they would forbid selfe-murthering, and
selfstarving, so here, where at one time eating at the Lords Table, and
reconciliation with the widow and fatherless, cannot be co-existent together
at one time and place, an exigence of divine providence forbidding both, the
bloody man is to debar himself from the Lords Supper, it being as
sacrificing and less necessary if we speak comparatively; and the Elders are
not to give those holy things to the bloody man, while (...), first he be
reconciled to the widow and Orphane, which now comparing the one with the other
is mercy, whereas eating and drinking at the Lords Supper is but Sacrifice, but
it should be as sacrificing with bloody hands, which God condemns and
forbids, and the Priests and Elders knowing it to be such a sin, ought to
forbid and to hinder it: Hence as this, I will have mercy and not sacrifice,
has this sense, I will have you to omit Sacrifice, when it cannot be done
without neglect of mercy, which is more acceptable to me then all Sacrifices;
so I will have reconciliation to the offended widow and Orphans, and not
coming to the Lords Supper without the former; for the former is more
acceptable to me, and should be to you and the Elders in your practice, then
the latter; and therefore the comparison of eating, and eating undecently
halteth; for eating undecently before another, which would procure deadly
sickness to your brother, ought to be forbidden by the Ruler, it being known
to be so, and ought to be abstained from hic and nunc, as a sin, and a
hurting of your brothers health, and yet the Ruler cannot forbid total
abstinence from meat to him that eats undecently, as the Elders cannot
command total abstinence from the Sacraments (...) always and in all cases.
2. We draw no conclusion of erecting a Presbytery from those places, but those
two we draw; Ergo, 1. It is a sin to the people themselves to sacrifice with
bloody hands, because God condemns such a manner of sacrificing. 2. Ergo,
they are to be debarred by some who has the charge of the holy things of God,
but from the Antecedent, we neither infer; Ergo, Presbyters, nor, Ergo, the
people, nor, Ergo, the Prince should debar them. 3. Calling on God is not to
be forbidden, nor giving of alms, because they are abused, but the manner of
the abusing those ordinances are forbidden by God, and may be hindered by the
Church, and forbidden under the pain of Excommunication. The Church cannot
forbid men of total abstinence from the Lords Supper, but they can command him
that is not reconciled to his brother, and visibly under the guilt of blood, to
leave the Table, as Christ Mat. 5. 23. commands the unreconciled man to leave
his gift at the Altar, and go first be reconciled with his brother, and then
at the next occasion, come to the Lords Supper; so the Church of the Jews
could not forbid the Pharisees to pray, but they could pass such an act, as
is, Act. 15. 22. We forbid Pharisees or any other to bring their private
prayers to the Markets and streets, and when they are to give alms, we forbid
them with sound of Trumpet to make proclamation to all men that they are the
only holy and charitable men in the earth. Nor do we think that the Church
can debar men from the Sacraments for inward and and invisible unworthiness;
but only for visible and professed uncleanness; and Levit. 9. 13. it is
clear, the man that is unclean is forbidden to keep the Passover. Will
Erastus say, O he is not forbidden to eat the Passover, but only he is
forbidden to eat it tali modo being unclean? and therefore it is not the
Priests sin if he should give the Passover to the unclean man, and forbid
him to eat tali modo, in his uncleanness? see Erastus himself against this,
lib. 1. c. 3. page 103. 104. where he confesses that the unclean are debarred,
and yet uncleannes in the eaters of the Passover, was an abuse only, and made
not eating of the Passover unlawful in it self.

So the Lord complains, Ezekiel. 23. 38. Moreover this they have done unto me,
they have defiled my Sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths.
39. For when they had slain their children to their Idols, then they came
(...) in the same very day into my Sanctuary to profane it; and lo this they
have done in the midst of my house. Will Erastus now say, It was Ceremonial
uncleannes, not Moral, to kill their seed to Molech; and that Moral
uncleanness and bloody murdering of their seed in the same day when a person
is to come to the Lords supper, known to be such a Murderer to the Elders who
have power to judge the scandalous and to cast him out, 1 Cor. 5. did not
sin, if they should be isntrumental to lead Murderers into the Temple? and
say to them, Take ye, eat ye, this is the body of the Lord that is broken
for you?

Erastus answers, The Prophet Ezekiel. 23. accuses not the Priests page 305.
or Elders, that they debarred not those Murderers from the Temple and
Sacraments, if there had been any precept for this, some footstep should have
appeared in Gods rebuking of them.

Ans. The Lord does not particularly reprove the Priests by name in every
place, in which he reproves the people: But expressly for this same very sin,
the Lord reproves the Priests, The Morally unclean debarred out of the temple.
Ezekiel. 44. 7. Let it suffice you, that ye have brought into my sanctuary
strangers uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my
sanctuary to pollute it - 8* And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things;
but ye have set keepers of my charge, in my sanctuary, for your selves. 24. And
in controversy they shall stand in judgment (he had spoken of their teaching
the people to discern between the clean and the unclean, v. 23.) and they
shall judge it according to my judgments, and they shall keep my Laws and my
Statutes in all mine assemblies, and hallow my Sabbaths, so 2 Chronicles. 23. 19.
And Iehojada set the porters at the Gates of the house of the Lord, that none
which was unclean in any thing should enter in. And shall we concelve that
porters, that is, Levites, would hold out those that were only ceremonially
unclean, and receive in murderers who had killed there Children to Molech that
same day? there was not to enter in (...) the unclean in any matter; the text
is general, excludes idolaters and murders, and such as should refuse to
enter in Covenant with the Lord, of which the Text speaks. As for Erastus his
consequence, which he unjustly imputes to us, to wit, Israel sinned in coming
to the Lords temple to profane it, in the very day that they slew their
Children to Molech; Ergo, there ought to have been Priests, and now there must
be Presbyters and selected overseers in a Church judicature to debar
murderers, and the like scandalous persons from the Sacraments. 1. This is not
our consequence. But this we say, if the Priests knew that same day, that they
came to the Temple, they slew their Children to Molech, the Priests should have
debarred them from coming to the Temple, and from eating the Passover, as
their office and duty was by the Law of God, Number. 9. v. 6, 7. Number. 19. 11, 12.
Lev. 22. 6. The soul that has touched any such (unclean) shall be unclean till
even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with
water, 7. and when the Sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat
of the holy things, because it is his food: Now it was the Priests office, Lev.
10. 10. that he put a difference between holy and unholy, and between clean and
unclean; so if Eli knew that his sons made themselves vile before the people,
and committed furnication with the women at the door of the Tabernacle of the
Congregation; Ergo, Eli should as a judge have restrained them, 1 Samuel 3. 13.
But from this antecedent, we draw not this consequence, Elies sons do
publicly make themselves vile; Ergo, there ought to be such an Ordinance as a
judge, with Civil power to punish them, and Ergo, there ought to have been no
King to punish them, but a judge like unto Eli and Samuel; this consequence
follows not from this antecedent, but only hoc posito, that Eli has the
sword, and be the Civil judge; Ergo, he ought to punish, from scandals in the
Church, and profaning the holy things of God, we infer not; Ergo, there must
be such a judicature erected, as if the antecedent were the cause of the
consequent. But this only follows; Ergo, supposing there be a Church and
Presbytery invested with this power, they ought not to admit murderers, or any
unclean persons to come and partake of the Sacraments, and so defile the holy
things of God: as for the place Ezekiel. 33. I undertake not from thence to
conclude debarring of any from the holy things of God by the Priests, what may
follow by consequent is another thing.

Erastus. Whereas it is said, Deuteronomy. 23. the Lord would not Page 305.
have the price of a whore offered to him; Ergo, far less would he have a
whore admitted to the sacrifice: it follows not, but a penitent, or a whore,
professing repentance, may be admitted to the sacrifices. 2. He forbids only
the price of a whore to be offered to him as a vow, or a thing vowed, it may be
that agree not to all sacrifices: For God forbids a living creature, that is
unperfect, in a vow; But Lev. 22. he forbids not such imperfect living
creatures to be offered to him, in a free will sacrifice, so God forbids
honey to be offered in an offering by fire, but not in all other oblations. But
will not the Lord have a whore to offer to God that which is lawfully
purchased, or which is her patrimony? or may not a whore offer her first borne
to the Lord, or circumcise him? We find not that forbidden. From things to
persons we cannot argue; we may not offer a lame beast to God; Ergo, does the
Lord so abhor a lame man, that he may not come to the Temple? God allows not
tares amongst the wheat, yet he will not have the external Ministers to pluck
up the tares while harvest.

Ans. If the hire received for a whores selling of her body to No price of a
whore to be offered to God; what it meant.
uncleanness, must not be applied to the service of God, far more cannot a
whore as a whore be admitted to partake of the holy things of God, for the
price or money is called abomination to God, Deuteronomy. 23. for the whore, not the
whore for the money; and so we may well argue from the things to the persons.
2. It is false that God forbids the price of a whore only in vows, and not
in sacrifices; he forbids it because as Moses says, Deuteronomy. 23. 18. it is an
abomination to the Lord, and as Erastus says, it is money unjustly purchased;
Yea, David's practice teaches, that what we bestow on sacrifices, as well as in
vows, it must be our own proper goods, and not so much as gifted to us, 2 Samuel
24. 24. Neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which
cost me nothing; far less would he offer the price of a whore in sacrifices;
and the Divines of England say on the place, hereby is forbidden that any gain
of evil things should be applied to the service Annot. an. 1645. an. ou Deuteronomy.
23. 18. Vata. in loc. que injuste parta sunt, nullo modo offerri debent Deo.
of God, Mich. 7. 1. Vatablus says the like. 2. For the Lords forbidding to
offer in a vow, Bullock or Lamb, or any thing that is superfluous, or lacking
in his parts, and permitting it in a freewill offering, by a free will
offering, is meant that which is given to the Priest for food, of a free gift;
but otherwise, what is offered to the Lord in a vow, or a free will offering
must be perfect: for the blind, broken, maimed, having a wenne, scurvy, or
scab, can in no sort be offered to the Lord, Lev. 22. 20, 21, 22, 23. There is
no word of the Lord in the free will gift that Erastus speaks of, but only
the word (...) is liberal, free, from (...) to give freely to God or man. 3. A
whore repenting or professing repentance, was not debarred from sacrifices; but
that is without the bounds of the question, an heathen could say, Quem penitet
facti is pene innocens est. Senec. in Traged, We debar none that profess
repentance from the seals of the Covenant. 4. When a whore as a whore did offer
her first borne being a bastard in the Temple, I conceive neither she nor her
child were accepted, Deuteronomy. 23. 2. Abastard shall not enter into the
Congregation of the Lord: if the child was born of Married Parents, the woman
repenting, the question now must be far altered. 5. For a lame man to be a
Priest, we can say something, but that all the lame in Israel were debarred
from the Temple, and the holy things of God, we dare not say; and a difference
of things and men we acknowledge, but that is nothing to weaken the argument.
6. How proves Erastus the tares are not to be plucked up by men? Mat. 13. will
bear no such thing: ill men are to be cast out of the Church before the day of
judgment, both by the Magistrate and miraculously by the Apostles, and by
Excommunication say we, Mat. 18. 1 Cor. 5.

Erastus. He that possesses the price of the whore, is not to be debarred out
of the Temple, though the money could not be offered to God. The Pharisees
would not have the price of blood cast in the treasure of the Temple; yet they
cast not Judas out of the Temple, which these patrons of Ceremonies would have
done, if there had been any Law for it.

Ans. This is to beg the question, the whore who sold her body for a price was
unclean, and more unclean then the innocent money, and so in that case excluded
from the holy things of God. 2. They admitted doves, oxen, and money changers
into the Temple and profaned it, and why should they cast Judas out of the
Temple? will their practices prove any thing, they used all divine ceremonies
and Laws of God to their own carnal ends.

Erastus. Heathens were not admitted into the Temple, Page 307.
But a scandalous man is a heathen, Ezech. 16. Your Father was an Ammorite;
also, if thou be a transgressour of the Law, thy circumcision is become
uncircumcision, Romans 2. he is worse then an Infidel, 1 Timothy 5. Erastus
answers, but if we look to Gods estimation, wicked brethren are worse
then pagans. But if we consider the external face of the Church, there be
many things in wicked men that agrees not to heathen, wicked circumcised men
might go in to the Temple. Gentiles might not; so the assumption is most false.
2. A circumcised man and a Baptisedman, can never turn non-circumcised, or non
baptized.

Ans. I say nothing to the cursing and blessing Deuteronomy. 27. Nor do I own that
Argument; it is not ours. 2. Those which are (so our argument runs) as
Heathens and Publicans, as Pagans, Ammorites, whereas they were sometimes
Brethren and Members Our chief argument for excommunication not answered.
of the Church, are not to be admitted to the Sacraments, nor to be
acknowledged as members of the Church more then Heathen, Ammorites, Pagans are
to be be admitted to the Sacraments and Members of the Church. But wicked men
amongst the Jews, and amongst us Christians, who will not hear the Church and
are fornicators, idolaters, railers, drunkards, and extortioners, and walk
inordinately, and cause divisions contrary to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus,
are to be esteemed as Heathens, Pagans, Amorites, and worse then Infidels;
therefore such amongst the Jews were not admitted to the Temple and holy
things of God, and amongst us not to be admitted to the Sacraments, nor to be
acknowledged as members of the Church. Erastus answers not to this Argument,
either Major or Assumption, but propounds an Argument of a namelesse Author,
as he knows best to answer and remove himself. 2. Many things (says he)
agree to Pagans and Turks which agree not to scandalous Christians. True,
scandalous Christians are not Amorites and Pagans simpliciter, they differ in
profession, the one being baptized, not the other; and once being baptized,
they can never be unbaptized; but that is not our Argument, but they agree in
this, that they are no more really Christians, being fornicators, railers,
drunkards, extortioners, etc. then Pagans, but have the only name and title of
such, and are to be esteemed so by us, and are to us quoad hoc, in regard of
Church privileges, as heathens and publicans, and so the Lord of old termed
his Apostate people Sodom and Gomorrah, Esa. 1. 10. and as the children of the
Ethiopians and Philistines, Amos 9. 7. and as unclean and incapable in a
Church way of the Passover, and now of the Lords Supper to us, as Ethiopians,
Sodomites of old, and this day Turks and Pagans are to us. 3. That the wicked
that were circumcised might go into the Temple amongst the Jews, de facto, they
might, but de jure, by Law, they might not, Ier. 7. 9. Ezekiel. 23. 39. Esa. 66.
3. no more then by Law they might profane the holy Name of God, or kill a man,
or sacrifice a dog to God, or offer swines blood, or bless an Idol, The
argument from sanctifying the Sabbath I pass, it has no sense nor reason as
Erastus propounds it.

Erastus. Christ Mat. 5. commands him who is to offer a Page 308. 309. The
place Matthew 5. When thou bring thy gift, etc. discussed.
gift, to leave his gift at the Altar, and first to be reconciled to his
brother; Ergo, he will have us not to use the Sacraments while we be first
reconciled to our Brother. But so (says Erastus) we should not pray to God,
nor seek forgiveness of sins, while we first forgive those that have
wronged us; Christ does not here speak of the external governing of his
Church, but of the perfection of a Christian man, else we could do nothing
that is good and just, and we were all to be Excommunicated, he says not, if
the Presbyters shall command; leave thy gift, but if thou shall call to mind
thy self; he speaks not of a prohibition of others discharging an instituted
worship, but of that which a man's own mind does enjoyne him, you may as
easily prove the Papists Mass from this, as Excommunication.

Ans. Surely this is to me convincing, if I be discharged by the Holy Ghost to
meddle with the holy things of God, or offering a gift, to God at his Altar,
while I first be reconciled to my brother; then those who have by office power
to steward those holy things, in wisdom, and fidelity, putting a difference
between the precious and the vile, knowing that I am at wrath wi^h my brother,
and having convinced me before two or three Witnesses that I have highly
trespassed against my brother, are to deny to Steward or dispense any such holy
thing to me, while I be first reconciled to my brother; and the like I say of
the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. 2. To Erastus his Argument, I answer, it is
not alike here as in praying, for praying is so absolutely necessary, that it
obliges by a command of God, even a Simon Magus to pray, while he is in the
gall of bitterness, that the thoughts of his heart may be forgive^, Act. 8.
22. But Erastus, as if he had set himself to contradict Christ, would
insinuate as much, as Christ were not to be obeyed, for his Exposition holds
forth this sense, When thou bring thy gift unto the Altar, and remembrest
that thy brother has ought against thee, leave not thy gift, depart not, go
not about to be reconciled to thy Brother, but first offer thy gift; But Simon
Magus, though he should remember that he was in the gall of bitterness, should
not delay to pray till he were first delivered from the gall of bitterness,
and then pray: Sure if Peter had said to Simon Magus, First labor to be freed
of the gall of bitterness, and to have thy thoughts pardoned, and then pray
that the thoughts of thy heart may be pardoned, as Christ says, First be
reconciled to thy brother, and then offer; and (as Paul says) First, Let a man
try and examine himself, and so let him eat and drink, the reply of Erastus
should have nerves. 2. It is true, Christ speaks not of the external
government of the Church; but it is as false that he speaks of the internal
acts of the mind; but he speaks of the right ordering of the external acts
of divine worship, which are regulable, though not quatenus, as regulable by
the Church, and draws an argument from the words by necessary consequence,
which consequence Erastus cannot elude. 3. But how does Erastus prove this
consequence, if our Exposition stand, and if we were to do nothing in offering
gifts at the Altar, except we be first reconciled to our brother, and if God
approve nothing which we do, which deviates from this perfection, we should
do nothing that is good and right, and so all must be excommunicated. 1. Is
Christ here injoyning a work of perfection, and of supererogation? Is Erastus
popish in this? 2. As it is impossible not to offer gifts aright, so is it not
to eat and drink worthily, while first we be reconciled to our brother:
Erastus was so surfetred with charity, as we heard before, that if any but
desire the Sacrament and profess repentance, he thinks he is obliged to
believe he is fit for the Lords Supper; and here, if Christ require, but that
the party be reconciled to his brother, ere he offer his gift and come to the
Sacrament, this is too great strictness, it should excommunicate us all, and
we shall so never do any thing that is right and good. 4. It is false that
Christ speaks here of internal acts only, and of that which our mind
injoyneth, for the Lord speaks of three external visible acts; 1. Of
offering a gift at the Altar. 2. Of delaying and suspending of the offering. 3.
Of a previous visible reconciliation to an offended brother. 5. He says not,
if the Presbyters bid you, (says he) leave your offering; true, he says not
that in words; but supposing this, that the Presbyters know that the same very
day that he brings his offering, he had been killing his own son to
Molech, as Ezekiel. 23. 38. 39. Whether were the Presbyters to forbid him to come
and offer, while he should testify his repentance; and finding him impenitent;
whether should they not judge him both to be debarred from the holy things of
God, and to be cast out of the Church, as 1 Cor. 5. Certain this is Christ's
order, Be first reconciled to thy Brother, and then offer; try thy self first,
and then eat; and if the Church see this order neglected, whether are they to
suffer clean and unclean to come and eat, and holy things to be profaned?

Erastus. He shall expede himself out of this doubt easily, Page 309. 310.
who can distinguish the internal governing of the Church, which is proper to
God only who knows the thoughts and can judge them without error, from the
external governing of the Church, in qua falli infinite omnes possumus in the
which we may all infinitely err, and in which we can do nothing, nisi quod
mandatum expesse nobis legimus, How men do judge of inward actions.
except what we read to be expressly commanded, for here he who is not against
us is with us, Mark 9. and no man ought to forbid those which God has
commanded, so they be externally done, all external actions quoad nos, to us
are good which are done according to the prescript of Gods Word, though to God
who judges the heart they be not good every way; many to day, the Pharisees
of old; many in Paul's time preach for gain, many are ambitious, and some out
of envy preach; Christ never for bad them to teach, nor Paul but rejoiced,
Phil. 1. that Christ was preached; hovvever since no man can understand the
internal actions or thoughts, and without error judge them* there is no
punishment by man's Law for them; only God, without error, judges and
punishes them.

Ans. There be many untruths here, 1. If this distinction of internal and
external governing of the Church, remove most of the doubts here, he that
eats and drinks unworthily, which is an act of external worship, which may
be regulated and ordered by the Church, (for the Church may not administer the
Sacraments to Pagans without the Church) is no sin to the unworthy eater,
because God commanded that external act expressly, as Erastus says, and so it
is a good action, quoad nos, even to the unworthy eater, for he knows not his
own thoughts, nor can he judge them without error, especially being
unregenerated. 2. If Erastus himself acknowledge this his own dis^inction, he
must acknowledge an external Church Government, and who then are the
Governors, especially in the Apostolick-Church, where heathen Magistrates are?
Pastors and Teachers no doubt, what means this then? my Brother trespasseth
against me and will not be gained? I tell the Church; ( Erastus says) I tell
the Christian Magistrate, but there is no Christian Magistrate, then there was
no external Government in the Church the first hundredth, nay, nor three
hundred years in the Church, or then it must follow, that the Apostles and
Pastors were the deputies of heathen Magistrates: Ergo, the heathen Magistrates
should with imposition of hands have been ordained the officers, (...), in
every Church. And that they were not; it was their own fault; for the
principal officer must be more principally called to office by Christ, and
given by him as a gift, when he ascended on high, to edify the body of the
Church, Ephesians. 4. 11. 3. Erastus will have men debarred from judging the inward
actions, because God only can judge them, sine errore, without error: But so
God only should judge all things internal and external, and there should be
no Magistrates, because men may err in judging the external actions of men,
and Page 310. Solus deus ut sine errore cogitationes judicat, ita easdem quoque
pu. nit. Ib. in rectione e^terna eccles^e infinite falli omnes possumu^,
quamobr^n s^ccr^ bio nihil debemus, quam mandatum express nobi^ l^gimus.
will not this gratify the Papists, who say in this; Tell the Church, that is,
the Pope who cannot err. Then the Synod cannot err, Protestants deny the
consequence; Synods may judge, as Act. 15. and yet Synods may err. 4. Erastus
will have us liable to infinite errors in external actions: therefore (says
he) we should do nothing in externalls, but what is expressly commanded; but
first may we not infinite falli, infinitely err in internal actions and
thought, and acts of believing? are we more infallible in internal, then in
external actions? New Theology: and are we not as well tied to what is
expressly commanded in internal, as in external actions? I think the word is
as strict a rule, and the Law of the Lord as perfect in the one as in the
other. 5. The great error is here, that Erastus being sleeping when he wrote,
thinks that to eat and drink unworthily, to offer a gift at the Altar, the
offerer being unreconciled to his brother, is an action internal and known to
God; and that can no more be known to man, then the thoughts of the heart: A
palpable untruth! is not worshipping of Baalim, murdering, stealing, whoring,
killing the Children to Mol^ch, and coming to stand in the Temple of the Lord,
which are called a profaning of Gods holy name, Ier. 7. 9, 10, 11. Ezekiel. 23.
38, 39. are not these actions visible, external, and as feazable to be judged
by man, as murder may be judged by a Magistrate? Yea, by this, let a Pagan
come to the table of the Lord, we are not to hinder him, why? it is an
internal action known, citra errorem, to God only, and we cannot then judge
whither he have examined himself or not; if he be not against us here, he is
with us says Erastus, Quod deus Page 309. Lib. 3. c. 3. A contradiction in
Erastus frequent.
facere jussit, ab eo revocari aut retrahi nullus ab hominibus debet: si modo
externe sic fiat, ut precepit deus; Yea, so the Magistrate cannot hinder either
Pagan or the open enemy, and persecutor, who will trample upon the Sacrament,
from the Sacraments; the contrary whereof Erastus said, page 207. hunc ego
minime admittendum censeo, and let Erastus give us Scripture, either express,
or by consequence, where a Pagan or a persecutor may be impeded by Church or
Magistrate from external receiving of the seals, except that we are not to
give pearls to swine? But was it not as hard to judge whether Saul persecuting
the Church out of blind zeal, was a swine, or a dog, as to judge whether he
that kills his son to Molech out of blind devotion, and comes the same day
to the Temple of the Lord, does profane the Name of the Lord? 6. If we must do
nothing in externalls without the express commandment of God, nor may we
without Gods command, either express, or a necessary consequence, admit dogs
and swine to the Lords table. 7. Paul indeed rejoiced that Christ was preached,
though out of envy, Phil. 1. but by men called and gifted of God to preach, and
therefore ought not to be forbidden to preach, while the Church, for their
scandalous life do cast them out; say they are called Ministers once, the
Church is not to cast them out, for this or that particular sin, if they be
not contumatious, and Paul, says he, Rejoices that Christ was preached; but
he says not, he rejoiced that they preached Christ, tali modo, out of
contention, thinking to add affliction to his bonds. Yet God forbids the
external act of preaching in those that hates to be reformed, Psalm. 50. 16,
17. and forbids the Church to lay hands on, or to call to the Ministry,
wicked men that hates to be reformed, or to keep them in the Ministry; and
this hinders not, but Paul might rejoice at the consequent of their Ministry,
to wit, at the preaching of the Gospel, so long as they remained in the
Ministry: as we may rejoice in that Christ was crucified for sinners, and not
allow that Herod and Pilate did with wicked hands crucify the Lord of Glory,
nor yet are we to rejoice in their sin. But all this hinders not, but he
that is at wrath with his brother, and known to be so by the Priests, should
be hindered to offer his gift while he be reconciled to him. 8. We are not to
hinder acts of external worship, as praying, praising, preaching; nor can the
Church forbid them, except where God by his Commandment require that we do
them wi^h a special visible qualification and order: As first, be reconciled
to your brother, first examine your self, and then of^er your gift, and come
and eat and drink at the Lords table: and in Negatives, Come to my Temple, but
come not that very day you killed your sons to Molech, while ye repent and be
humbled for that sin.

Erastus. The godly Kings compelled the people to observe the rites Page 311.
ordained of God, at least externally, and 2 Chronicles. 15. killed those that
sought not the Lord, then they sin who punish sins by debarring men from
the Sacrament: for beside that, they forbid a thing commanded of God, and as it
falls under men's judgment, that is, as it is external and good, so they
cast their sickle in another man's field, because the correcting of sins in so
far as they are external belongs to the Magistrate, and in so far as
they come from a depraved will, they belong to God only.

Ans. Here is one palpable error, that all external scandals are punished,
either by the Magistrate as the Magistrate, so he must be understood, else he
says nothing, or by God only, contrary to 1 Cor. 5. 11. Romans 16. 17. 2 These.
3. 14, 15. For we give a third, they are punished by the Church, but only in a
Ministerial way. It is false that the godly Kings could compel the unclean
Jews, though circumcised to come to the Temple, or the murderers of their
Children that same day, to come with bloody hands to the Temple: Yet the very
local and personal presence of a Jew in the Temple, and the very posture of
his body in looking with his face toward the Temple while he prayed, was an
external lawful Ordinance of God: They could not then lawfully compel the
Jews to these rites, except with such and such previous qualifications; they
could not compel the Priests unwashed, and having drunk wine to go to the
Sanctuary, 2 Chro. 15. It is not said, they were to be put to death that should
omit any Ceremony, (though every Religious observance be a seeking of God) but
they that would not seek God by entering in Covenant to renounce idols, and
serve the Lord, or should prove apostates from the sworn Covenant, were to be
put to death. 3. If that be a punishment (we contend for things, not for names)
which is a privation of good inflicted for a sin: then let Erastus s^e, if
the Priests punish not, who debarred men from the holy things of God (by
Erastus his grant) for Ceremonial omissions against a Law of God, And if the
Priests should not suffer an unreconciled man to offer gifts, and if the Church
should deny pearls to apostates, if this be not punishment? and if the
Magistrate be to cast out, or inflict Ecclesiastical censures, shall he not
punish in so doing?

Erastus. To be cast out of the Synogogue is not to be Excommunicated: Page
311. 312. 313. What it was to be cast out of the synagogue.
For the Synagogue signified sometime all Judea, sometime a particular
Congregation, or the place of meeting, or the sermon. By no Law could a
circumcised Jew be cast out of all Judea, and sent to the Gentitles, or be
compelled to say they were not Jews; Yea, they were killed who denied Iudaisme.
2 Maccabees so the cast out of the Synagogue, were not debarred from the
Temple. The Church of the Jews was tied to one certain place, but every
particular Church has alike power: To be cast out of the Synagogue then with
the Jews, must be another thing, then to be Excommunicated now, for he that is
cast out of one particular Church, is cast out of the whole Catholic Church.
But it was not so in Judea, for Sacrifices and Sacraments (except circumcision
and expiation) were only at Jerusalem, not in Synagogues: how then could they
deny Sacraments, which they wanted themselves? they could not deny what was not
in their power to give: Moses was read in their Synagogues every Sabbath, No
man could be forbidden to hear the word read, this had been against a manifest
precept: It is like they admitted heathens to the Synagogue, Act. 13. 14. c.
12. c. 18. But it was not lawful for heathen to enter into the Temple: And
when Moses commanded all the clean to go to Jerusalem, no Synagogue could
forbid them to go.

Ans. That the Synod might have diverse significations, I deny not, but that to
be cast out of the Synagogue had diverse significations, we deny; Yea, it
signified no other thing but to be cast out of the Church, and the Lord Jesus
speaks of it, and the Evangelists as of a standing censure in the Jewish
Church, which the spirit of God condemns no where, except when it was abused,
Ioh. 9. 22. Ioh. 12. 42. Ioh. 16. 2. Luke 6. 22. Ioh. 9. 35. so is the word
(...) Nadah, to Excommunicate as an unclean thing, Esaias 66. 5. Your Brethren
that cast you out. Pagnin and Mercer expound it of casting out of the
Synagogue, and they cite Ioh. 9. and 12. and 16. to make it signify
Excommunication. 2. That a circumcised Jew could by no Law be cast out of
Judea, seems to say, that banishment was not a lawful punishment: Surely
David against all Law then did banish Absolon, 2 Samuel 14. 13. and when the King
of Persia, Ezra. 7. 25, 26. commands Ezra to restore judicatures, as at the
beginning; It would seem that banishment was an ancient punishment amongst the
Jews: Therefore Erastus craftily says, that no born Jews were so cast out of
Judea, that they were compelled to say they were not Jews. Surely we never
dreamed of such an Excommunication, that the excommunicated should be compelled
to lie, and say that though they were Jews and Christians, yet they should say
they were not Jews or Christians. 2. When the people was in Egypt, 2 Mac. they
were killed who denied themselves to be Jews, and deservedly, for they denied
their Religion and their God. What is this against Excommunication? We plead
not for such an Excommunication, as was a local extrusion of a person out of
the land of Judea, nor for such a one wherey they denied their Nation, that was
a sinful lying. But such, whereby Church privileges were denied to some for
scandals. 3. Nor do we expound casting out of the Synagogue literally, as
Erastus does, to be a casting out of the Synagogue or from the Ordinances
there, and from hearing the word or the Law of Moses: for the Synagogue is the
Church, and it was to be debarred from the Temple, Passover, and other Holy
things, though these should be tied to one certain place, to wit, to the
Temple; and I doubt, if the excommunicated be to be debarred from hearing the
word; 1. Because the excommunicated is to be admonished as a brother, 2 These.
3. 15. and the word preached is a mean simply necessary for the man's gaining.
2. Because heathens were not excluded from hearing the word, 1 Chronicles. 14 23.
Act. 17. 16. 17, 18, 19, 20. etc. Act. 14. v. 15, 16, 17. But from the Temple
and Sacraments they were excluded: We have often answered, that all the Morally
unclean, though they were ceremonially clean, are not only not commanded to go
up to Jerusalem, that is, to the Temple and holy things, that they are rebuked,
and accused, because they stood in the Lords Temple with their bloods and
idolatries, and other abominations in their skirts, Jeremiah 7. verse 9. 10.
Ezekiel 23. 38, 39. Esaias 1. verse 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

Erastus. They call Christ a Samaritan, Ioh. 8. Those of Page 313. 314.
Nazareth not only cast him out of the Synagogue, but out of the town, and
strove to throw him over the brow of a mountain: Who d^ubts then but they cast
Christ out of the Synagogue, when they made a Law, that if any should confess
him, he should be cast out of the Synagogue: Yet never man objected to Christ,
(It is not lawful to thee to go into the Temple, for thou art cast out of the
Synagogue.) Ergo, to be cast out of the Synagogue was not to be excommunicated.

Ans. All these are poor conjectures, for Erastus grants there was such a
censure as casting out of the Synagogue, But he shows not what it is. But I
retort this argument; if Christ had been cast out of the Synagogue, those that
called him a Samaritane, and cast out of their Synagogues, such as confessed
him, would have sometime said, ( it is not lawful to thee to go into the
Synagogues and teach, for thou art cast out of the Synagogue.) But by the
contrary, Christ till the day of his death, openly taught in the Synagogues,
Ioh. 18. 20. I spoke openly to the world, I ever taught in the Synagogue and in
the Temple, whither the Jews always resort, Luke 4. 15. he taught in their
Synagogues, Luke 4. 16. as his custom was, he went into the Synagogues* Mat.
4. 23. Mark 1. 39. Mark 3. 1. Luke 6. 6. Mat. 9. 35. Luke 13. 10. and therefore
it is a demonstration to me, that they never cast Christ out of the Synagogue;
what hindered them, says Erastus? I answer. Let him show me what hindered them
to stone him, Ioh. 10. and not to put him to death till his hour came. Erastus
speaks not like a divine, who scoffeth at the secret Counsel of God: For God
had the sufferings of his own son Christ, in a special manner, determined
and weighed, in number, weight, and measure. And therefore though they made a
Law, that all that confesses Christ should be cast out of the Synagogue, and
though those that sinned against the Holy Ghost, Matt. 12. called him a
Samaritane, and out of a sudden passion, those that wondered at the gracious
words that proceeded out of his mouth, would cast him over the brow of a
Mountain; Yet I hold, they never made any Law, no^ did execute any Law, nor
did cast out of their Sgnagogue, or excommunicate the Lord Jesus. I leave
Erastus to his conjectures.

Erastus. Act. 4. and 5. The Apostles were scourged and page 31^.
cast out by the high Synagogue summa Synagoga, yet presently they teach in the
Temple, and use the Sacramen^s, Act. 21. When Paul Act. 21. was to go to the
Temple to sacrifice, the Apostles who counseled him so to do, do not object,
that he was excommunicated, and so could not by Law do so; His adversaries
accuse him that he taught against the Law, and that he profaned the Temple, by
bringing in the Gentiles, he openly says, he had done nothing against the Law.
Then to be cast out of the Synagogue is not to be excommunicated, for one cast
out of the Synagogue, could not but do against the Law, if he should go to the
Temple and sacrifice.

Ans. If Erastus would argue logically (as to me in my humble apprehension, he
is still weak in all his book in this) we should find frothy grounds: as thus,
If those who were scourged and cast out of the Synagogue (to wit, unjustly and
against all Law of God for preaching Christ Jesus) were never accused for going
into the Temple and using the Sacraments, and say, truly they did nothing
against The Apostles not cast out of thy Synagogue, that we can read.
the Law, then the cast out of the Synagogue might lawfully go to the Temple
and partake of the Sacraments; the proposition is the greatest untruth that can
be. 1. Erastus must prove that the Jews accused the Apostles of all and every
thing, which they conceived to be against the Law. I conceive this is a
conjecture, and false. 2. The other part of the proposition is as false as to
say, light is darkness; if Paul cast out of the Synagogue, and excommunicated
against all Law of God and Moses, yet go to the Temple and sacrifice, and
partake of Sacraments, say he does nothing against the Law; then casting out of
the Synagogue and Excommunication does not exclude any from the Temple,
sacrifices and Sacraments: this is as much as Paul should say, unjust
Excommunication against all Law of God and of Moses for righteousness sake,
does exclude no man from the Temple and the sacrifices and Sacraments; Ergo,
casting out of the Synagogue and Excommunication rightly administered, does
exclude none from the Temple, sacrifices and Sacraments: Surely (...) is
abominable to ascribe as much to unjustly administered ordinances, as to the
j^st ordinances of Christ. Erastus must lay down the Popish ground of Navar
and Gregory, that Excommunication Navar. in Ench^rid. c. 27. 11. n. 13. Greg.
q. 3. c. 1.
sive de justa, sive de i^justa causa, either for a just or an unjust cause is
to be feared, and has force. Might not Paul though he had been unjustly
excommunicated, go to the Temple and Sacraments, and yet say he had done
nothing against the Law? might not the man whom Jesus found after he was
unjustly cast out of Temple and Synagogue, Ioh. 9. 39. say, I have done nothing
against the Law, nor do against it, though I go to the Temple? 3. How will
Erastus prove that the Apostles, Act. 4. and 5. or Paul were c^st out of the
Synagogue or excommunicated? I never could read it: They commanded them neither
to preach in Temple or Synagogue any more in the name of Jesus; But that they
cast them out of the Synagogue, or cast Paul out of the Synagogue, where is it
to be read? let Erastus teach us.

Erastus. It is hard to say, what it is to be cast out of the Synagogue, Page
315.
it was not Excommunication, it seems to be some note of infamy, Ioh. 12. or
a particular banishing them out of a town, and Jesus seems, Luke 4. to be
banished by the Nazarites, and it seems to be a denying of right of the City;
so as the cast out of the Synagogue shall be no more esteemed for a true Jew, but
as a prosylite; Prosylites dwelt amongst the Jews, and had right to those same
holy things with them, yet were they distinguished from the Jews: so it seems
to be that which is Ezra 10. to be separated from the Crongregation of those
that had been carried away captive. It agrees with that Deuteronomy 23. where
the Children of Edom were admitted ^^ enter into the Congregation Page 316.
of the Lord in their third generation. Its absurd to think^ that God who is no
accepter of Persons, will not have one cut off, a Bastard, an Ammonite, a
Moabite received into his Kingdom: So the Lord refused not that they should be
circumcised and admitted to the Sacraments; but he would not have them counted
for true Jews; He would have Egyptians and Edomites received in their third
generation: so their Father, Grandfather, and great Grandfather had been
circumcised, otherwise to the thousand generation they were ^ot received, and
(...), and (...) to cast out, or to be cast out of the Synagogue are meeker
words then to condemn, cast out, excommunicate; and though the Pharisees
should debar from the Sacraments those that are cast out of the Synagogue, we
are not to imitate the examples of ill men.

Ans. 1. If it be hard to determine what it is to be cast out of the Synagogue,
it is hard to deny it to be Excommunication; for to be a Member of the
Synagogue, as an Elder or a Ruler of the Synagogue, was to be a Member of the
Church, and a Church privilege; Ergo, to be cast out of the Synagogue must be
to be unchurched, and made no Member of the Church, and this is very like
Excommunication: however, Erastus cannot deny it to be some Church censure
like to Excommunication as any thing can be. 2. That it was a civil banishing
out of a Town, or that Christ was banished by the Nazarites out of Nazareth
leans upon Erastus his ita videtur, so it seems; To which I crave leave to
say, non ita videtur, it appears to be no such thing, Christ came again to
Nazareth, and till his death was never banished from Synagogue or Temple, John
18. 20. They should rather have been said to cast Christ out of the Temple and
banish him from Jerusalem, for Ioh. 10. 22, 23, 31. They took up stones to
stone him, v. 39. then to banish him out of Nazareth, or cast him out of the
Synagogue. 3. Prosylites had all the right that Jews had by Gods Law, what men
denied them, is not the question. Erastus spoke nothing from Scripture or Gods
Law, that was one and the same to the born Jew, and the stranger that came in
and was circumcised, and gave his name to the Israel of God. 4. To be deprived
of the privilege of a city is a civil punishment; Ergo, to be cast out of the
Congregation or Synagogue, which was a spiritual and Church punishment was no
such thing. 5. The separating from the Congregation, Ezra 10. 8. was
Excommunication; the Annotation of the English Divines say it was
Excommunication, such as casting out of the Synagogue, Ioh. 9. Annot. an. 1645.
on Ezra 10. 8.
22. 6. If it agree with Deuteronomy. 23. 8. To enter in the Congregation of the Lord,
is to be a Member of the Church of God, and therefore the Hebrew reads it,

1, 2. the Law is, that the Moabite and the Ammonite should not enter into the
Congregation of the Lord for ever, It is said v. 3. They separated from Israel
all the mixed multitude, so that clear it is, to enter into the Congregation
is to become a Member of the Church; then to be separated from the
Congregation, must be to be cast out of the Church, and deprived of the holy
things of God, as heathens and strangers were, according to that Levit. 22. 10.
There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: What is this but
Excommunication? call it with another name* we care not, it is really to be
separated from the Church. 7. It is admirable to me to hear Erastus say, It
cannot be that God who is no accepter of of persons, will not receive into his
Kingdom a Bastard, an Ammonite, a Moabite? Is not this to reason against the
Law of God, and the wisdom of God? Deuteronomy. 23. 1. 2, 3. who says, that he will
not receive such into his Church, which is his Kingdom, and a company of Kings
and Priests unto God, which he has freely loved, Exodus 19. 5, 6. Psalm. 149. 1.
Deuteronomy. 7. 7. Deuteronomy. 26. 16, 17, Erastus ib. 315. Non igitur noluit Deus hosc^
circumcidi, and in Templum atque ad Sacramenta admitti, sed noluit proveris
Judaeis ^os haberi.
18. as ^o^ the rejecting of men from his heavenly Kingdom according to Gods
decree of eternal Reprobation, I deny Excommunication to be any such rejection
of men; it being only a casting them out from the visible Church, and the
special Church privileges, that their Spirits may be saved in the day of the
Lord; and what can be more contrary to the Word, then that Erastus should say
God declared not, that it was his will that Moabites, Ammonites should not be
circumcised, an^ admitted to the Sacraments. Why then did he not choose
Moabites and Ammonites for his people, and make a covenant with them, and give
Circumcision a Seal of the Covenant, as he dealt with the Jews? if he mean
God will not exclude Moabites and Ammonites from the Sacraments, so they repent
and turn to him: but now Erastus fights with his owneshaddow. Who denies but
Jews and Gentiles, so they call on him, are welcome to all the holy things of
God, and not to be cast out of either Church or Synagogue. 8. To say, to cast
out of the Synagogue, is a meeker word then to Excommunicate, is but to beg the
question. Yea, but says Erastus it is less and a milder thing then to
destroy, and pro deplorato habere, to esteem a person lost, we say
Excommunication is not to destroy or to give for lost, but though it be the
most violent, yet it is a saving remedy that the man may be ashamed, humbled,
and his Spirit saved. 9. We reason not from the fact of Pharisees, if they cast
any out of the Synagogue for a just cause, they ought also by Gods Law to
debar them from Temple and Sacraments, and therefore if they did not debar,
it was their sin, not our Rule.

CHAP. XXI.
Quest. 17.
Diverse other Arguments vindicated, as from Communion with the Church,
subjection of Magistrates and Ministers: The Ceremonially unclean from Matthew.
18. Tell the Church.

Erastus. Christ has given a power to his Church to loose, Erastus. l. 6 c. 1.
p. 317.
Ergo, also to bind: The Church admits Believers into Communion; Ergo, they
cast out the impenitent. Erastus Answers, Such a power as they have to Ioose
and to admit; such and no other have they to bind and to cast out; but it
follovveth not, Ergo, it is a power to debar from the Sacraments, and to
Excommunicate: it is a Genere, and Speciem affirmative.

Ans. Erastus is mistaken, and forms the Argument as he pleases. The Church
pardons as a Church, and receives into her body believers to participate of
Church Priviledges and Sacraments in a Church Communion; Ergo, the Church has
power to bind and cast out from this same Church Communion, those that
leaveneth the whole lump; as a City may admit a stranger to all the City
privileges; Ergo, the same City may for offenses against the City, cast out
and deprive of City privileges offenders: is this a Genere ad speciem
affirmative? If the Church have a power to cast out (...) from amongst them a
Member, we shall Page 318. Ministers subject to the Magistrate.
not contend for the name of Excommunication.

Erastus. The Ministers have none, by whom in their office they can be
corrected: But says Erastus, If every soul be subject to the higher powers,
how are Ministers excepted? if Ministers correct Ministers, they play to others
hands, spare thou the nails, and I shall spare the teeth.

Ans. The Author does not except Ministers from civil subjection to
Magistrates: But only he says, In Ecclesiastical censures, the Magistrate is
not to judge the Ministers; because a Ministry being an Ecclesiastical
office, as such, it is not liable to the civil power, only the Ministers as
they err and sin in their persons, are liable to civil punishment, but not to
Ecclesiastical, to be inflicted by the Magistrate. 2. Through the corruption
of men's nature, every one may wink at another faults: It is true, But consider
if this slow from the nature of Gods Ordinance, to wit, that the Citizen obey
the Laws of the City whereof he is a member. This is an Argument against any
Senate, Parliament, Counsel of State, or War, or Aristocracy on earth: if of
an hundredth Lords of the States General, one or ten play the Traitor to the
State, who shall take order with them? Their Colleagues and fellow-Senators.
Partial judging falls out here through men's corruption: spare thou the nails,
and I Will spare the teeth: and from Erastus his way, (if you Argue from men's
corruption) the same will follow: May not the Magistrate say to the Minister,
Honor me before the people, and Preach not against the sins of King and Court,
and I will oversee and wink at thy Pluralities, non-residencies, soul-murthers?
And may not the Minister say to the Magistrate, Let me be above all Civil
Laws, and be Lord Prelat, and sit on the necks of my Brethren, and defraud,
oppress, and I shall be silent and preach nothing against the idolatry,
oppressions, Sodomy, uncleanness of Magistrate and court.

Erastus. The Ceremonially unclean were excluded from the P. 318. 319.
Sacraments; Ergo, far more the Morally unclean; But how (says he) does this
follow? You Excommunicate none but the obstinate; for those that were
Ceremonially unclean against their will, were excluded from the holy things;
Ergo, far more he that is Morally unclean is to be debarred, though he be not
obstinate: How could Paul Excommunicate the incestuous man, 1 Cor. 5. he was
never admonished; or Peter Excommunicate Annanias, as you say?

Ans. All Types or comparisons hold only in that for which the spirit of God
does bring them: Now the Ceremonially unclean were debarred from holy things,
to signify how much God detests filthiness. 2. Filthiness, polluting and
leavening others: Now the less will in any sin, the less sin, and so the
less contagion to others, and therefore, where there is much infirmity, less
will, and no contumacy, it rather follows, Ergo, there should be no casting
out, no Excommunication.

Erastus. The Ceremonially unclean were not counted as Page 318.
condemned and lost, as your Excommunicated persons were; they were admitted to
Sacraments and the yearly expiation.

Ans. This is Answered fully: The Excommunicated, because Excommunicated, are
to us in a way to be saved under Medicine, and not given for lost, no more then
those to whom the Pastors do threaten eternal wrath, or those with whom we
will not eat, because of their inordinate walking are given for lost, though
conditionally they are in danger of damnation if they repent no^. 2. It is
denied that the Ceremonially unclean were admitted to the Sacraments. Philo
Judaeus, no less well versed in Jewish Antiquities then Josephus, Tract. de
sacerdotum honoribus, says, Nulli homicidae licebat introire Templum: and
Josephus, l. 19. c. 7. says, Herod Agrippa who beheaded James the brother of
Christ* accused one Simon, who being a wicked man, went into the Temple, Q^ia
Templum non nisi puris and dignis pateret: he witnesses the same, De Bell.
Jadaic. l. 4. c. 13.

Erastus. The comparison holds not between two sins, P. 319, 320.
which have both of them their own appointed punishment, but when both is
punished with one punishment: for it is like this, He that killed any
imprudently, was compelled to flee to the City of Refuge, which was a less
sin; Ergo, he that vvittingly and vvilfully* kills, should rather fly to
that City; or* a drunken man is to pay a fine; Ergo, a bloody Robber is far
rather to pay a fine.

Ans. When the comparison is made between a Ceremonial breach, which is
punished with a punishment Ceremonially, or mystically significant; the
comparison to a moral sin punished with punishment real, signified by that
Ceremonial punishment, is inconsequent: But when both sins have the same
punishment in the general, in genere, it follows not, that both should have
the same, in spe^i^, in nature, as a drunkard ought to be punished with
stripes; Ergo, parricide ought rather to be punished with death; but not Ergo,
a parricide ought rather to be punished with stripes only: And so the
consequence is naught, the leper was punished with being put out of the Camp
seven days. It follows not, Ergo, he that is defiled with the soul-leprosie
of murder, sorcery, should far rather be punished only with being put out of
the camp seven days: Because there is a higher punishment ordained for moral,
then for a Ceremonial transgression, Ceteris paribus.

Erastus. If Peter Excommunicated Ananias, as you say for a Page 321.
private, far more should Christ have Excommunicated Judas for a more haincus
private sin.

Ans. We say not that Peter Excommunicated Ananias, but that his killing of him
pointed at the punishment of wicked men in the bosom of the Church. 2. Gods
punishing of sinners both in the time when, and in the manner, with what kind
of punishment, is no rule to the Churches or Magistrates punishing. If God
spare Joab all David's time, it follows not, Ergo, David the Magistrate ought
also to spare him. If God command to kill the man that gathers sticks on the
Sabbath: it follows not, Ergo, the Church or Magistrate may do the like now,
if any should gather sticks on the Sabbath.

Erastus. Let every man try himself, he speaks of the secrets of Page 321.
Conscience. Erastus. That is (says he) false, he speaks of open sins of
Schismatics, of those that came drunk to the Table, and eat things Sacrificed
to Idols.

Ans. Erastus mistaketh close the Authors meaning, which is to speak of the
private and personal self-examination that every Communicant is to enter in
before he eat, not of the public trying, 1 Cor. 5. men are to make a secret
trial even of public sins; so though the sins were public, yet was the
trial secret and personal, but did not exclude a public examination by the
Church, if need were.

Erastus. Though those that come to the Supper profess Repentance, Page 321.
yet many hypocrites come: So Isa. 1. those Hypocrites might have said, We
testify by our sacrificing, that we have hands full of blood; If we deal
Hypocritically or sincerely, God who knows the hearts only must judge, men
must judge the best. Erastus says to the place, Isa. 1. we have Answered
before: But (says he) if they had said, It is true, our hands are full of
blood, but we repent and are sorry, O Prophets, pray to God to have mercy on
us, and we shall pray? They could not be debarred.

Ans. The man that was unreconciled to his brother might say all that at the
Altar to the Priest. Yet Christ seeks some more of him, he will not have him
admitted to offer his gift, but he must leave it there, and give more then
words to both God and the Priest; he must go and humble himself to his offended
Brother, and be reconciled to him: And so the Prophet, Isa. 1. seeks more of
them, ere he will have them to Sacrifice: Wash you, make you clean, put away
the evil of your doings, cease to do evil, learn to do well: All this is not
done in a moment at the Altar.

Erastus. Tell the Church, that is, Tell the Magistrate, if he be not Page 322.
a defender of a wicked Religion: For I suppose, 1. That Christ speaks of the
Church in Judea, which the Disciples understood where to find it: Now the
Disciples understood so well the Church, that they put no Question to Christ of
the matter. 2. Peter only says, How often shall my Brother offend and I forgive
him? Now Peter and the Disciples knew nothing of the spiritual Fraternity of
the Gentiles before his Resurrection: For they knew only Jews were their
Brethren, and they were forbidden to preach to the Gentiles or Samaritans now.
3. Let him be to thee as an heathen and a Publican; that is, Let him be as a
man most opposite to the Jews: Heathens and Publicans did grievously oppress
them, and made the Roman yoke very burdensome to them.

Ans. 1. Erastus does suppose, (which is most false, as I have Though there
were no framed Christian Church, yet Christ might say, Tell the Church.
Answered before) that Christ speaks to Paul from heaven and Ananias also, of
bearing the Name of Christ to the Gentiles: and Paul neither knew Name nor
thing, Act. 26. 15, 16, etc. and 9. 15, 16, etc. He speaks to his Disciples
of the promise of the Father, and of the Testimony of the Gospel they were to
Preach, Luke 24. 46, 47. etc. which they knew not till afterward. And what was
the use of the holy Ghost to be powered on them? Was not this one of the chief?
Joh. 14, 26. He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your
remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you: Then Christ spoke many things to
them that they bothforgot, and knew not till the holy Ghost came upon them. And
their not asking Question, will not prove they understood all he spoke,
sometimes they were afraid to ask him. 2. The Jewish and Christian Church have
not such essential differences, but they knew by the ordinary notion of the
word Church, a Convention that professed the Doctrine of the Prophets, and of
the Law and Gospel. And what such great difference is there between a brother,
and a brother Jew and a Brother Gentile, as they behoved to understand the one,
and be utterly ignorant of the other? And what necessity to restrict it to Jews
only? Christ had often spoken to them of the incoming of the Gentiles, as
Matthew. 8. 11. Joh. 10. 16. Matthew. 10. 18. Did the Disciples know the Kings,
Councels, Indicatures of the Gentiles, that Christ said they should be
convented before? Matthew. 10. 17, 18, 19 And because Erastus is so confident
that the word Church here is the Civil Magistrate: Let any Erastian teach me,
what is meant by (...) Church, Matthew. 16. 19. Is it the Civil Magistrate? Is
the Civil Magistrate built on a Rock? Shall the Ports of Hell never prevail
against the Civil Magistrate? Can no Magistrate make defection from the truth?
And does Erastus or his believe in their conscience, that the Disciples
understood Christ, Matthew. 16. (for he spoke of both to the Disciples) to speak
of the stability and strength, and perseverance of the Christian Magistrate:
And that the Ports of Hell should never prevail against the Jewish Sanedrim and
Church, which crucified the Lord of glory, and persecuted his Apostles, and all
professing the Name of Jesus to the death? 3. Heathen and Publican in general,
were names as opposite to Christian Brethren as to Jewish Brethren, as I have
proved before.

Erastus. The word Church to the Hebrevvs, signifies either P. 323. 324
a multitude, or the Senate, or Magistrate, as Number. 35. Church is four times,
Josh. 20. Tvv^ce, Psalm. 82. Once: and it signifies the Magistrate. So we say,
the Empire has done what the Emperor with the States of the Empire has
done. So the Church or Convention think so, because the chief amongst them
think so, the Common Wealth has done this, because the Senate has done this.

Ans. The word (...) is Number. 35. 12. But in all that Chapter (...) is not, but
(...): Now how this signifies one Magistrate, which ever signifies a
collection or multitude of rulers, I leave to the learned: so Erast. fails
yet in his probation. 2. Suppose the word Church signify the heads of the
people, how shall Erastus prove that (...) signifies the senate of Civil
Magistrates, for in this Congregation were the Priests and Levites, especially,
that judge between blood and blood, voluntary or involuntary homicide, Deuteronomy.
17. ^2, 13, 14. 2 Chr. 19. 8, 9. It is true also that the man that killed
another unwittingly, was to be protected in the City of refuge, while he should
stand before the faces (...) of the Congregation, But let Erastus, and all who
will have the Bishop or the Pope the representative Church, know that (...) the
Congregation, ever, and always be a Pagninu^, Merc. in Thesaur. p. 994.
collective word, as populus the people, signifies a multitude, and never by
Grammar, one single man, hoc nomen (says Pagnine) certum conventum* sive cetum
significat, certum Collegium, it always signifies a soc^e^ie: as the Princes
of the Congregation Number. 16. 2. all the Princes (...) in the Congregation, Exo.
34. 31. here is a number and a society, (...) says Aristotle can be atributed
to no fewer then to three at least. Speak to all the Congregation of Israel
(...) Exodus 12. 3. and the Congregations of peoples (...) shall compass thee
about, Psalm. 7. 8. Nor shall sinners stand (...) in the Congregation of the
just, Psalm. 1. 5. Thou have made desolate all my Congregation, Job. 16, 7. 2.
The word is from a root that signifies to conveene and gather together (...)
Therefore Iud. 14. 8. a swarm or a Congregation of Bees, is called (...) a
Congregation. And that the word (...) Church since the world began, never
signified one single man, either King, Magistrate, Pope, or Prelate, But
always a multitude either of rulers or people, I appeal to Demosthenes, Homer,
Pho^illides, Hesiod, Lucian, Pluto, Aristotle, to Suid^^, Stephanus, Scapula;
or for the word, Cetus, Cong^egatio, to all Latin Authors, to the seventy
interpreters in the Old Testament, to Hy^ronimus, all the Greek Fathers, and to
the Evangelists and Apostles in the New Testament, to Act. 19. 32. Ephesians. 5. 23.
Act. 8. 13. Romans 16. 5. 1 Cor. 1. 2. 2 Cor. 1. 1. Gal. 1. 2. 1 These. 1. 1. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 1. Act. 15. 3, 4, 22. Act. 16. 5. Act. 14. 23. Rev. 1. 20. Rev. 2. 1.
and for Psalm. 82. (...) there is a Congregation of Gods or Magistrates, and v.
6. All of you are Children of the most high, he speaks evidently of a
multitude of Judges. 3. Suppose the Empire be said to do what the Senate,
Parliament, or great Council of the Empire or Kingdom does: This will not
prove that the word Church in either of the Original Tongues Hebrew or Greek,
does signify one man, so as Tell the Church, must be all one with, Tell one
single Magistrate, or, Tell one Prelate or one Pope, and he that will not hear
the Magistrate, that is, the King, or one single Magistrate alone, without any
fellow Magistrates, he being a Christian, is to be dealt with as an heathen,
and a publican, and not as a Christian brother: For what the King does alone
without his Senate, is never called the deed of the Senate, far less the act
or deed of the whole Ecclesia, of the Kingdom, produce any shadow of Grammar
for this: Now to Erastus, Tell the Church, is all one with, Tell the single
Christian Magistrate alone separated from Fellow-judges, or Council, Senate,
Parliament, Ecclesiastical Assemblies, and if he hear not and obey not this
one single Christian Magistrate, let him be to thee as a heathen and a
publican: For Erastus will have the Civil Magistrate, though the whole Church
and Pastors should judge the contrary, to have power by virtue of his office to
determine against Pastors and Elders: Yea, by his office he is to command them
to preach, and synodically to determine this and this, and what they determine
they do, a et sub Magistratu, under, and from this one single Magistrate as his
servants, instruments, Vicars and deputies, and therefore the Magistrate cannot
sentence in the name of Pastors, Elders, when they are but his servants: And,
2. When he may by his office, do contrary to what they judge in conscience
ought to be done: So Tell the Church, to Erastus is, Tell the one individual
single Magistrate, who by office may judge without, and contrary to the advice
of all the Church Pastors, Doctors, Elders, yea, people and all: Now though we
grant, that what the Emperor does as Emperor, and the Magistrate as
Magistrate has done, that the Empire, City, and Incorporation does, (which yet
is never true in the Church, which has no King as a Church, save only the
head and King Jesus Christ) yet Erastus has not proved, what the Emperor does
without, and contrary to the advice of all the Empire, that the Empire has
done that.

Erastus. Christ either understands by the Church the whole multitude Page
324. 325.
of Jerusalem, or then the Magistrates: But he understands not the multitude,
1. Because Christ would not change the Government of heathens, far less of
that which his Father had appointed in Judea, in which the people did never
Govern: Yea, the Apostles to their death did nothing against Moses his Law,
and how they take Christ to speak of a Church to be founded of new after his
resurrection who believed not he should die and rise again; and after his
resurrection knew not what a kingdom, whether worldly, or spiritual, he was
to ^ave, cannot be conceived.

Ans. 1. Many will deny the Major, for he understood the rulers of the
Christian Church, not excluding the consent of the Christian Church of
believers in the matter of Excommunication. 2. I deny that Christ does here
re-establish a Synedry, and bid them Tell the Scribes and Pharisees, and those
that were to crucify himself, and to persecute the Apostles to the death.
Christ knew those to be miserable healers of scandals between brother and
brother. 2. He knew this Sanedrim to be the Disciples of Christ's capital
enemies, he warned the Disciples to beware of the leaven of their corrupt
Doctrine, he prophesied this Sanedrim should be destroyed as a degenerated
plant, that his heavenly father had not planted, and was it like Christ would
direct them a perishing and degenerate remedy against scandals, that he would
have removed by his Church, even till the end of the world? 2. It is most
false, that the Apostles did keep to death the institutions and ordinances of
Moses, Act. 15. They abrogated all the ceremonial Law, except that of blood
and things strangled, and Paul said, he that would amongst the Galathians be
circumcised, was fal^e from Christ, see Col. 2. Gal. 4. Heb. 13. and elsewhere
the contrary. The Government was now to expire with Christ's death and
ascension, in so far as it was pedagogicall. 3. Christ spoke often of his
Kingdom to them, and they understood nothing but an earthly and temporal
Kingdom; and that they understood perfectly: All this time the Church of
Pastors, Teachers, Elders, Deacons, believers in Christ, is denied; Let Erastus
answer, when Christ said Mat. 16. He would build his Church on a rock
unpregnable and insuperable to hell: If the Apostles understood a Church to be
founded after the resurrection, and when Christ said, Lo I am with you to the
end of the world, if Christ meant not he would give his presence to the
Christian Church, not then founded, for even after his resurrection they
dreamed of an earthly Kingdom, Act. 1. and that our divines do rightly expound
that place, I am with you, All the faithful Pastors, Doctors, Church Officers
and believers to the Lords second appearance, is clear.

Erastus. Christ bade, Tell that Church which has power to conveene Page 326.
the offender before it, examine Witnesses judicially, cognosce and give
sentence, but in Christ's time the multitude could not do this.

Ans. Ergo, the Church has a spiritual judicature: This is for There was no
more a right constituted Sanedrim in Christ's time, then a Christian Church.
u^. 2. Nor had the Sanedrim the power in all offenses, as Erastus would make
the world believe, for it was but a shadow at this time void of power, and used
what power they had against Christ and the Gospel. Nor needs Erastus to prove
that by the Church the multitude cannot be understood; though he cannot exclude
them from their own part in Church Government, both in consenting, and in
withdrawing from the Excommunicated.

Erastus. But, Tell the Church is all one with this, Appoint Page 327.
some who in the name of the Church may manage the business; but how prove
they this? Then Christ bade, Tell the Elders that then were, else he did not
accommodate himself to their understanding to whom he spoke; when he was to
teach how our sacrifices pleases God, be bids us first be reconciled to
our brother, and then sacrifice, yet he knevv that sacrifices were to be
abolished, but by Analogy he would teach us, what he requires when he
says, he will have mercy, and not sacrifice; Ergo, by your own confession to
tell the Church is to tell the Sanedrim, for there was then no Church but the
multitude.

Ans. 1. (Tell the Church) cannot in any sense, have such a meaning, as Appoint
Elders and tell them; for then ( Tell the Sanedrim) must have this meaning, set
up a sound Sanedrim, according as Moses appointed, and tell the Sanedrim. The
Sanedrim in its right constitution and due power as the Law of Moses required
it, was not to be had at this time: Herod had killed the Sanedrim, the Romans
made High Priests from year to year against the institution, the power of
life and death in the civil Sanedrim was now none at all. The Scepter was
departed from Judah, those that sat in Moses Chair corrupted all, so the
right Sanedrim was no more now to be had, then a Christian Church not yet
erected. Again, Tell the Church, presupposes a constituted Church, and
therefore cannot include a command to erect a new mould* 2. Tell the Elders of
the Christian Church, may as well be meant in these words, Tell the Church, as
the Jewish Church can be understood. 3. The word Church, and to conveene
offenders, hear Witnesses, give out sentence, were all plain Language to the
disciples, though they knew not the frame of the Gospel Church, as yet, Christ
being now teaching an ordinance of a Church, and the censure of Excommunication
that was not to fall under practice, while Christ should ascend to heaven; and
therefore though this Church was not, yet it follows not, that the Lord Jesus
speaks of the Sanedrim. 4. Say that he mean the Sanedrim; Ergo, say we, he
speaks nothing of the Christian Magistrate. 1. Because there was no
Magistrate now, but Jewish Magistrates as Erastus cannot deny. 2. Because this
Sanedrim that gained souls of offending brethren, was Ecclesiastical, not
civil. 3. By proportion, and Analogy Christ must understand the Church of
Christians, though the Sanedrim was to be removed shortly.

Erastus. It is a great controversy, who are to be chosen Page 328.
out of the body of the Church to excommunicate judicially.

Ans. The controversy was moved partly by Erastus, partly by Morellius, not in
the reformed Churches.

Erastus. Some say the Magistrate should choose the Elders page 329.
at least at the first, even though the Church do not consent. But how can
they sit in place of the Church and judge, who were against the will and mind
of the Church chosen to be Judges? for though the Magistrate be a chief Member
of the Church, yet to Tell the Church, is not to Tell the Magistrate (as you
say) but to Tell the whole Church, and it is no ^xcuse that the Magistrate does
but once choose the Elders, for if he have no right nor Law from God to do it,
he can never do it, and if he have Law from God to do it, he ought always to
do it.

Ans. Here Erastus reasons against some Au^hor that inclines to the way of
Morellius.

If there be no formed Church endued with knowledge and discretion to choose
their own Elders, if there be godly men fit to be chosen, they are to convene
and choose from amongst them Elders, the godly Magistrate is to join his Vote
and Power, because Iunius ^nim^^. in Bellar. d^ ^o^ci^. l. 1. c. 12. Not. 18.
de^^^iente conjunctione Magistratus, potest a liquid Ecclesia extra ordi^em
^ace^e, quod ordinario non potest, and contra deficiente Ecclesia a suo
officio, potest Magistratus extra ordinem procurar^ ut Ecclesia ad officium
r^de^^, id ^nim juris communis est, extraordinariis ma^is remedia etiam extra
ordinem adhiberi posse. Page 329, 330.
there is a Church not yet constitute, it is now Perturbatus aut corruptus
Ecclesiae status, and I ever judged it a golden saying of that great Divine
Fran. Iunius, that when the Magistrate will not concur, the Church in that
extraordinary case may do somewhat, which ordinarily they cannot do; and
again when the Church does not their duty, the Magistrate in that case may do
something more then ordinary, to cause the Church do their duty; for its a
common La^, to ills out of order, remedies out of the road way may be applied.
So if the Priests and Levites be corrupt, Iehoshapaht and Hezekiah and Josiah
may reform: And therefore though the godly Magistrate, jure communi, by the
common Law of Nature, employ his power to appoint Elders, all Errors and
confusions in the Church are in some measure out of order; yet it follows,
that jure proprio, and ordinarily he should always do this. 2. Elders are not
properly Representators of the Church to me, while I be better informed, for
power of feeding and ruling is immediately given by Jesus Christ to the Elders,
and not by the interveening mediation of the Church, but only by their
designation to the office; th^s power is given by the people. 3. The Magistrate
as the Magistrate, and by virtue of his place, is neither a Member, far less
a chief Member of the Church, for then all Magistrates should be Members of
the Church, even Heathen Kings and Rulers, which no man can say. The Christian
Magistrate as a Christian is a Member of the Church. But that is nothing to
help Erastus.

Erastus. Because the multitude can do nothing in order, therefore (say they)
they have power to choose Elders to whom belongs the power of
Excommunication. But how prove they this? Though a company vvanting a
Magistrate have this power, shall it follovv, that a company to whom God has
given a godly Magistrate should have this power? But because confusion would
follovv, therefore Elders are to be chosen; Ergo, Such Elders as make up your
Presbytery, a genere ad speciem affirmative nulla est consequutio.

Ans. 1. Not only from necessity of eschewing confusion, but from the positive
Ordinance of God, we infer Presbyters; we do not own any such consequence:
Prela^es and Papists argue for a Monarchy in the Church, from order: we know no
creatures of the like frame: Erastus is for a Bishop, he may so argue, not we:
We find Christ has placed such organs in his body, as Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. 1 Cor.
12. 28. 1 Timothy 5. 17. 1 Timothy 3. 1, 2, etc Act. 6. 1, 2, etc. and 14. 23. Ergo,
they ought to be, for we think the Church cannot govern it self. 2. If the
Church wanting a Magistrate as the Apostolic Church did, have power to choose
Presbyters, and by a Divine Law: how dare Erastus say, That it follows not,
when the Church has a godly Magistrate, she should keep the same power? Can
the godly Magistrate when he comes into the Church, take any Divine power from
the Church? Is the Magistrate given to the Church as a Nurse-father to preserve
that power that Christ has given to his Spouse? or is he given as a spoiler at
noon*day, to take to himself the power, and make the Ambassadors of Christ, his
Ambassadors and Servants to preach in his Name; whereas before when they had no
Magistrate, Pastors did preach only in the Name of Jesus Christ?

Erastus. Sure the Lord has concredited to the Magistrate, the Page 330.
Command and all power of external Government, so as he has subjected not
only Civil, but also Sacred things to his power, that he may manage the one
according to the Word of God, the other according to Justice and equity, which
since it is Commanded in the Old Testament, and practiced by all holy Judges
and Kings, and we find it not changed in the New Testament; We justly say that
the Church that has a godly Magistrate, cannot by Gods will choose a new Senate
or Presbytery, to exercise publicly Judgment; for God has not armed*
subjects against their Magistrates: Nor has he Commanded them to take any part
of their power from them and give it to others, and to subject them to
external Dominion.

Ans. Sure the Lord concredited to the Priest, not to King Vzziah to burn
incense, and to the Priests to rebuke Vzziah and command him to desist; and
this is no less external Governing of the house of God, quoad hoc, in this
particular then Excommunication: for to Excommunication on the Churches part,
as Excommunication, is no more required, but that the scandalous and murdering
Magistrate should not come to the Table of the Lord, or remain in the society
and Church Fellowship of the Saints as a Member of the Church. Now if the
Magistrate obey not, the Church as the Church can use no bodily coaction or
restraint to hinder the Magistrate to obtrude himself upon the holy things of
God: though other, either fellow-Magistrates, or the inferior Magistrates, (if
the party ^xcommunicated be the supreme Magistrate) or, the Parliament may and
ought to use their power as Magistrates, by the sword to hinder the holy things
of God to be profaned; for I think it easy to prove, if this were a fit
place, that inferior Magistrates are essentially Mag^strates, and immediately
subject to the King of Kings for the due use of the sword, as the supreme
Magistrate or King: And therefore there is no more external dominion used in
Excommunicating a bloody and scandalous Magistrate, then in rebuking and
threatening him: Now Erastus grants, That Pastors may rebuke and threaten
according to the Word of the Lord, even Magistrates and Kings. 2. If because
Judges in the Old Testament, as Eli and Samuel Sacrificed, and we find this
not changed in the New, and nothing extraordinary in this, Ministers in the New
Test^ment may do the same: Then the Justice of Peace, and Mayors of Cities, and
every constable, may by virtue of their office Preach the Word and dispense the
Sacraments, which is against the word, Heb. 5. 7. Mat. 9. 38. and 10. 5. and
28. 19, 20. Joh. 21. 20, 21. Romans 10. 14, 15. 3. Where does Erastus read in
the New Testament, that Kings may not write Canonick Scripture, as King David
did, and build a Typical Temple to the Lord as Solomon did, and give out Laws
of Divine institution as Moses did? Kings in the Old Testament did these, and
he can find the contrary no where written. 4. If the Church as the Church
cannot choose a Senate of Elders to Rebuking of Princes argue no less
jurisdiction, then all that the Presbytery does.
Govern themselves without wronging the Magistrate; how did the Apostolic
Church without so much as asking advice of the Civil Magistrate, set up a new
Gospel, new Sacraments, new officers, a new Government: Did the Lord Jesus and
the Gospel teach them to spoil Caesar? Christ had said the contrary, Give unto
Caesar those things that are Cesars. 5. To subject Magistrates to
Excommunication, is no more to subject them to external dominion, then to
subject them (as Erastus does) to rebukes, warnings and threatenings; for the
former has no more of coaction, of dominion, or of coercive power, then the
latter: yea, if to subject Kings to the rebukes of the Ministers of Christ, be
nothing but to subject them to internal and spiritual dominion; no more is
suspension from the Sacraments and Excommunication, any thing but internal and
spiritual dominion. In this sense, that neither of these two are bodily
dominions, no more then rebuking of Kings. 2. Yet both these work upon the
conscience in a spiritual way, for the humiliation of the King, and putting
him to shame and fear, 2 These. 3. 14, 15. that his spirit may be saved in the
day of the Lord, as rebukes do work, 1 Timothy 5. 20. Gal. 2. 11. 1 Cor. 5. 6.
Jude ver. 23. Yea, to say to a King, He shall be buried with the burial of an
Ass, as Jeremiah did, cap. 22. And to call the Rulers, Princes of Sodom, Isa.
1. 10. And King Herod a Fox, and Rulers and Princes Dogs, Psalm. 22. ver. 16.
and Bulls and Lions, ver. 12. 13. and Wolves ravening for the prey, Ezekiel. 22.
27. puts no less shame upon Magistrates before men, and so external
dominion on them and over them, then Excommunication and debarring from the
Seals of the Covenant does. Now Erastus subjecteth Magistrates to rebukings,
threatenings and reprehensions no less then we do. Well, Erastus will have one
single Minister to exercise external dominion over the Magistrates, because
this is manifest out of the Word: but because he would flatter Princes as much
as he can, he denies that a College of Elders may rebuke the Magistrate, or
convene him before them, though he were the most flagitious Prince that lived;
and yet one man may summon him before the Tribunal of Christ, and charge him
to come to hear a Sermon, and rebuke him in the face of the Congregation, and
denounce the Judgments of God against him openly. Is not this the Lord arming
one single man against the Magistrate, to put shame and confusion on him for
his sins? And if many Pastors convened should do this, This were to arm the
subjects against the Magistrate, and to take the power from him that God has
given to him, as Erastus talks.

CHAP. XXII.
Quest. 18.
Of exclusion from the Sacrament, of profession of repententance, the judicial
Law binds not Christians. The sword not a mean, of conversion, Of Idolaters
and Apostates in the judgment of Erastus.

IN this Chapter Erastus disputes against a Treatise written in Erastus l. 6.
c. 2. p. 331. 332.
the German Tongue, in which he acknowledges, there is more learning and truth
then in the other writtings. All the opinions that Erastus ascribes to this
Author, (justly or unjustly, I know not, but Erastus his faith may be justly
suspected) I cannot defend.

Erastus. Touching those to be admitted to the Sacrament, we speak always, de
illis solis, etc. of those only who rightly understand the Doctrine of the
Gospel, and do approve and embrace the same, and who desire with others to use
the Sacraments aright, in regard of the externals, of which only the Church can
judge, for the heart is rightly known to God only; so the Author and we agree.

Ans. The agreement is but poor by your own relation: But 1. Let Erastus
answer, what if the Christian Magistrate as Achab be a dog, and sell himself
to do wickedly: What if he understand not the Doctrine of the Gospel?
Magistrates as Magistrates by virtue of the throne, or place, are not
privileged to be Orthodox and holy. Let one Julian once a Christian, yet
turning a sow, an enemy to the Gospel be witness, if we descend to the
Justices, and to Master Constables; it may be we find even of those dogs and
swine in their conversation, though their place be a power, lawful, and
ordained of God; We think (says Erastus) the custom of the Church should be
observed: What? by the custom of the Church only, by no precept or command of
Christ should the holy things of God, the pearls of the Gospel be denied to
dogs and swine contrary to Christ's command, Mat. 7? 2. Erastus must exclude the
Magistrate out of the lists of his disputation in six books, and say, If the
Christian Magistrate be ignorant and scandalous, and yet desire to use the
Sacraments right, and profess he will learn to know God, and to believe
soundly, and walk holily, Yet the Sacraments are not to be denied to him. Tell
Erastus, in sincerity who should debar the Magistrate? For in all your six
books, you by these words, de illis solis, etc. profess that you plead not
that he should be admitted to Magistrates if scandalous are to be debarred from
the Sacrament.
the Sacraments; who shall exclude him? not he himself; for his credites sake
he shall desire to come to the Sacraments, as many for gain and loaves follow
Christ, Ioh. 6. will they not follow him also to be seen of men, as the
Pharisees prayed in the streets? 2. Let Erastus say, when our Savior said,
Give not holy things to dogs? Did he mean to accept the persons of Kings and
Judges, and profess, though Kings and Judges be dogs and swine* yet deny not
holy things to them? 3. Has Christ appointed no way in the New Testament, as
he did in the Old, to debar unclean men from our Passover? Or shall there be
no Government, no charge in the Ministers of the New Testament to keep the holy
things of God from pollution? If Master Justice be an incestnous man, a
drunkard, a dog, shall he not be cast out of the midst of the Church? Vzziah
though a King, yet for bodily leprosy was separated from the people of God,
and men of high places, though dogs and swine shall be admitted to all the
holy things of God under the New Testament?

2. Erastus will have all admitted who desire to use the Sacraments right; As
touching all externalls, of which only the Church does judge: But, 1. Where
did we assert that the Church judges of internalls? and that they may debar
men from the Sacraments, for only heart-unbeleefe known to God only? This must
lie on Erastus, as a calumny, while he make it good from our writings and
Doctrine, that we thus teach, exclude those that are visibly scandalous and
profane, and we are satisfied. 2. He that brings his offering to the Altar,
and has done a known offense to his brother, (for it is a sinful and visible
scandal, which scandalizeth one brother) He uses not the holy things of God
right, even as touching externals; He that comes to the Lords supper desiring,
and asking the ordinance of righteousness (as Isaiah speaks) and promises
amendment; and yet is openly ignorant and not sound in the faith, he uses not
aright the Sacraments even in externals, of which only the Church judges
rightly: as he that in the same day comes to the temple to worship (now the
very personal presence of a Jew in the Temple which was a Type of Jesus
Christ, was a worship and a holy thing of God, whereas our presence in the
place of meeting for worship is no such thing) when he has killed his son to
Moloch, profaned the Temple, and the name of God, even in externals; for the
Priests of old who were to put differences between the clean and the unclean,
no more were to judge the inward thoughts and heart-dispositions of men known
to God only, then we can now judge them in the New Testament, 1 Chro. 29. 17. 1
King. 8. 39. 1 Chro. 28. 9. Prove. 15. 11. Hence, that is an ignorant speech of
Erastus, Quistatuit malus esse, non prodibit in ecclesiae faciem, ut se
poenuere prioris vite testetur, ac meliorem promittat. P. 331. 332
That man shall never come before the face of the Church, to testify that he
repents of his former wicked life, and promise amendment, who purposes to be
wicked: Will not men purpose not to be reconciled to their brethren, and suffer
many suns to go down in their wrath and malice, who come and bring their
offering to the Altar; why did then Christ forbid offering at the Altar, without
being reconciled to an offended brother? Mat. 5. might not the offending
brother offer his gift? and were not the Priests to except his offering? He
could say all that Erastus requires: I acknowledge I have offended my brother,
I promise to crave him pardon, and I desire to offer according to the Law. Then
the Priest was obliged to believe he dealt sincerely, and lay his gift upon the
Altar, though he should not obey the command of Christ, and go and leave his
gift at the Altar, and not offer while he were first reconciled to his brother;
and the like I say of one that has killed his brother, and comes with hot
blood to the Table of the Lord, and goes not to the Widow and Orphans, whose
Husband and Father he had killed* to be reconciled: Surely the man that should
thus offer, should not come to offer, nor to eat at the Lords table rightly;
even in regard of externals, which the Church may judge: for he should omit
this external, Be first reconciled to the Widow, and then offer, and eat as
Christ commanded. 3. It is against Scripture and experience, that a man that
has a purpose to kill his Father, and in the highest point of treason to
invade King David's throne, as Absolon did, to say he will not profess to pay
his vows at Hebron. And might not Judas by his very eating the Passover,
profess he believed in the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the
world, and that he would serve Christ, and yet purpose in his heart to sell his
Master Christ for 30* pieces of silver; They seem to be little acquainted with
the mystery of the hypocrisy naturally in men, who put in print such a
position: The Author against whom Erastus writes says, We have reason to
rejoice, if we find any such, who will not profess faith and repentance,
though they be Hypocrites; and therefore there is need of Excommunication, and
his meaning is, that there is need of Excommunication always, and therefore
there will be many who profess Repentance in words, whose life and
conversation belie their Repentance; and Erastus cannot deny this, if he know
what it is ^o have a form of godliness, and deny the power, which form many
have who are to be debarred from the Sacraments, and to be Excommunicated, in
regard they are lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankefull, without natural affection,
truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that
are good, traitors, headie, high minded, etc. 2 Timothy 3. 1, 2, etc. and such
they are in the eyes of men, otherwise Paul would not forbid to withdraw from
such.

Erastus. The Author I think would yield that the Sacraments Page 332.
should not be denied to those who seek them, and desire to use them aright,
and are not excommunicated, for the writes that the denial of the Sacraments,
is only a Testimony of excommunication; So when we give not a Testimony of a
thing for example of learning, to any to whom the thing it self, to wit,
learning does not agree, we cannot deny the Sacraments to those who are not
Excommunicated, for he should not be blotted with a Testimony of a banished
man, who is not declared to be banished.

Ans. 1. The Author I think would never yield, but the Sacraments ought to be
denied to those who ask for them, and desire to use them aright, if they be
otherwise Truce Breakers, false accusers, incontinent, traitors, for those
have, and may have a form of godliness, and ask the Sacraments and desire to
use them aright; I mean they may say they desire to use them aright, for of
their inward desire, God only can judge, who knows the heart; yet the Author
cannot, he will not say, that such are to be admitted to the Lords Supper, all
tha^ Erastus goes on i^, That the Church is obliged to believe that those do
repent, and use the Sacraments aright, who say in word of mouth, they do so,
and therefore are to be admitted to the Sacraments, though they come but an
hour before out of the Bordell house, and have hands and sword hot and smoking
with innocent blood. Now Dogs, and Swine, C^in; Judas, known to be scandalous,
may give fair words, and cry, Lord, Lord, and profess all this, as is clear,
Isa. 58. 2. Mat. 7. 21, 22. Romans 16. 18: Mat. 23. 13* 14, 23, etc. 2. Exclusion
from the Sacraments is a Testimony of Excommunication, but not testimonium
proprium quarto modo, for some that are not excommunicated, are to be debarred
from the Sacraments as the thing it self will force us to acknowledge; should
any come with his sword hot in blood, from killing his father and Pastor to the
Lords Table, I hope the Church knowing this would not admit him to the
Sacrament, and yet he is not yet excommunicated, and I hope they would not
presently in the same moment that they debarred him from the Lords Supper,
excommunicate him. There must be some time required to pray for him, to rebuke,
convince, and lay open his sin before he be excommunicated, which moved me to
think that there was necessity of express Scripture to prove Excommunication;
but that abstention (as Divines calls it) or suspension from the Lords
Supper, may well be sufficiently proved by Analogy, by consequent and by the
nature of the holy things of God, and Pearls that are not to be given to the
profane. 3. A visible scandal is a sufficient ground of the lesser
excommunication, or debarring from the Lords Supper, and so we put a Testimony
of one banished from the holy things of God on him who has committed a
scandalous offense, which is a sufficient ground thereof, though the offender
be not formally excommunicated. This Author says, without the consent of the
Church, no man, though contumacious, should be excommunicated; What this is
against us, or for Erastus, I see not, we say the same.

He says, The Magistrate may choose some of the congregation to Excommunicate;
which if he say, I consent not to him, and see no warrant for it in Scripture:
But I rather believe his sense to be, That the godly Magistrate may command the
Church to Excommunicate and punish them, if they be negligent in this. But
hence it follows not, that the Magistrate may Excommunicate them, as Erastus
infers, no more then of old; it follows, King Vzziah might command the
Priests to burn incense to the Lord, and punish them; if in this they should
neglect their duty: Ergo, King Vzziah might lawfully in his own person burn
incense to the Lord: Erastus himself will deny this consequence.

Erastus says, It is evident this Author means, That God commanded Page 334.
not a Presbytery to be, but that it is necessary for orders cause. But I had
rather that he had proved it from the Authors words: And so I deny it, while
Erastus bring his own words to prove it: I believe he fancies many things of
this worthy Author, as that he subjects not the Magistrate to the Presbytery:
And why? Because he says, None ought to be Excommunicated without the consent
of the Magistrate. Truly it is a weak reason; for if the Magistrate be a godly
man, and a Member of the Church, it is necessary that his positive consent be
had, that he may in light and faith use the sword against him, as against other
evil doers. But I give him no negative voice, nor any authoritative or
Ecclesiastically judicial voice in Excommunication, which can be due to him as
a Magistrate: So the Author does not at all disagree from us; Erastus is
mistasten.

Erastus. God has Excommunicated Drunkards, Hypocrites Page 335.
from the Sacraments except they repent: But where has God commanded such,
being Circumcised and Baptized to be excluded from the Sacraments? especially
if they profess that they repent of their former ways: for it is one thing to
be excluded of God, another thing to be cast out of the visible society of the
godly.

Ans. God has Excommunicated Drunkards and Hypocrites, who are not known
openly to be such to the Church, and therefore the Church cannot debar such
from the Sacraments, and so we grant all, That it is one thing to be
Excommunicated of the Church, and another to be Excommunicated of God. 2. He
asks, where has God commanded to debar such from the Sacraments being
circumcised and baptized? I Answer then, If they be uncircumcised and
unbaptised, God will have the Church to debar them. But let Erastus show any
Scripture for their exclusion, but such as warranteth us to exclude the openly
scandalous, though circumcised and baptized. 3. What warrant has the Church or
Magistrate, if Erastus so will, to debar all the uncircumcised and ^nbaptised
from the Sacraments; Job, the Eunuch, are not Excommunicated of God* Ergo, if
the Lords non-Excommunication be our rule, we cannot Excommunicate all the
uncircumcised and baptized as such. 4. Erastus adds, They cannot be excluded
from the Sacraments, Presertim s^ p^nitentiam vitae anteactae prae se ^erant,
especially if they profess repentance. But this presertim* especially, seems
to infer, though they profess no repentance, but be dogs and swine, they ought
not to be debarred from the Seal* Is this piety, or rather prophanity? But
only he would say, they are far less to be debarred if they profess
repentance. But we know, to profess repentance in Erastus his Every profession
makes not men capable of the holy things of God.
way, is to say by word of mouth, they repent: Now this saying so, may consist
with being openly dogs and swine. Hence we see the contradicent of Erastus his
saying, to wit, that the most openly scandalous are not to be excluded from the
Sacraments, especially if they say they repent, that is, especially if they lie
and dissemble before the Sun, yea, though they mock God and repent no^. I
should think their saying they repent, when their flagitious and impure
conversation does belie their profession, makes them so much rather worthy to
be debarred, being both dogs and Hypocrites* So far I am from Erastus his
presertim, especially if they profess that they repent.

Erastus. I grant it ^ighteth with Gods will, that pardon Page 335. 336.
should be denied to any by the Word, and yet pardon* sealed to those same men
in the Sacrament: But when the Word denies remission of sins absolutely to
those, the Sacraments are not due to them; but the Word denies not remission
to them upon condition they repent, and so neither should the Sacraments be
denied to them.

Ans. But the word denies absolutely remission of sins to dogs and swine, so
long as they repent not; and that so much the more, that they say they repent,
and their life belies their words, and testifies to their face, and before the
Sun, that they are pla^stered Hypocrites, Ergo, the Sacraments should be denied
to them.

Erastus. But it follows not that the Sacraments belongs not to Page 336.
him who is not a member of the invisible Church, so he be a member of the
visible Church; but as he partaketh only of the external Communion, so he
receives but the external elements, from an external Minister.

Ans. But if he be visibly no Member of the invisible Church, but in the eyes
of the Church visibly a dog or a swine, neither ought the external symbols,
that are even externally the holy things of God to be given to him: for
otherwise, this Argument shall conclude, if one be baptized, and a member of
the Church, though a dog, yet the pearls of the Gospel are to be cast to such a
dog, which Erastus himself denies: And so this Argument hurts Erastus as
much as us.

That this Author says, God commanded those that transgressed his Page 336.
337.
holy Law with an high hand, and presumptuously to be killed, lest they should
live and profane his holy things; I defend not: But sure Erastus erreth, who
will have all such to be killed by the Magistrate under the New Testament,
because they were killed in the Old: Then are we to stone the men that
gathers sticks on the Lords day; the child that is stubborn to his Parents,
the Virgins, daughters of Ministers that commits fornication are to be put
to death. Why, but then the whole judicial Law of God shall oblige us
Christians as Carolosladius and others teach? I humbly concieve that the
putting of some to death in the Old Testament, as it was a punishment to them,
so was it a mysterious teaching of us, how God hated such and such sins, and
mysteries of that kind are gone with other shadows. But we read not (says
Erastus) where Christ has changed those Laws in the New Testament. It is true,
Christ has not said in particular, I abolish the debarring of the leper seven
days, and he that is thus and thus unclean shall be separated till the
evening; nor has he said particularly of every carnal Ordinance and judicial
Law, it is abolished. But we conceive, the whole bulk of the judicial Law, as
judicial, and as it concerned the Republic of the Jews only, is abolished,
though the moral equity of all those be not abolished; also some punishments
were meetly Symbolicall, to teach the detestation of such a vice, as the
boaring with an A^le the ear of him that loved his Master, and desired still to
serve him, and the making of him his perpetual servant. I should think the
punishing with death the man that gathered sticks on the Sabbath was such; and
in all these, the punishing of a sin against the Moral Law by the Magistrate,
is Moral and perpetual; but the punishing of every sin against the Moral
Law, tali modo, so and so, with death, with spitting on the face: I much doubt
if these punishments in particular, and in their positive determination to the
people of the Jews, be moral and perpetual: As he that would marry a captive
woman of another Religion, is to cause her first pare her nails, and wash her
self, and give her a month, or less time to lament the death of her Parents,
which was a Judicial, not a Ceremonial Law; that this should be perpetual,
because Christ in particular has not abolished it, to me seems most unjust;
for as Paul says, He that is Circumcised becomes debtor to the whole Law, sure
to all the Ceremonies of Moses his Law: So I Argue, a pari, from the like, He
that will keep one judciciall Law, because judicial and given by Moses,
becomes debtor to keep the whole judicial Law, under pain of Gods eternal
wrath.

We do not teach that men are to be Excommunicated, for whatever scandalous
sins deserve death at the hand of the Magistrate, whether they openly repent or
not; if any give evident signification of their repentance for murder, they
are not to be Excommunicated, for the end of Excommunication, being once
obtained, which is the visible and known repentance, and saving of the
offenders soul, the mean is not to be used, which is Excommunication. But if
any commit murder, whether he repent or repent not, the Lord has made no
exception of regenerate or not regenerate, of men repenting or not repenting,
he should die by the sword of the Magistrate, Genesis 9. 9. It is true, some are
to be Excommunicated for the very atrocity of the sin, it being parricide; but
that is, because he gives no positive signs of repentance to the Church,
which is contumacy added to his parricide.

Erastus would prove, That God would not have men dedebarred ^^ 340.
from the Sacraments, because they commit heinous sins to be punished with
death by the Judge: 1. Facinora saepe sunt occulta, such crimes are often
unknown to the world.

Ans. That which is denied, is not concluded a fault in Logic; for only
scandals as scandals to the Church, and so known to the Church are to be
censured with Excommunication.

Erastus. He thus would prove the same, often these crimes cannot be punished,
as David durst not punish the murder of Ioab, 2 Samuel 3. Often for other causes
they are neglected by the Magistrate, as David neglected to punish the incest
and murder of Absolon, but shall we think such were not to come to the Temple
and Sacraments? so Psalm. 14. David says, There was not one that does good,
those were not all punished by the Magistrate; yet were they not removed from
the Sacraments.

Ans. Let Erastus argue here, and we shall see his logic; Those that commit
parricides, sorceries, and do trample the holy things of God under feet, whom
yet the Magistrate dare not punish, because of their power and greatness*
those are not to be debarred from the Sacraments. But there be many scandalous
persons in the Church, such as Ioab, whom the Magistrate dare not punish, for
their greatness; Ergo,

Ans. The Major is manifestly false, and a begging of the question: For Erastus
says, page 207. He thinks such ought not to be admitted to the Sacraments
who will trample on the Sacraments and profane them. For though the Magistrate
dare not punish them, which is his sinful neglect, if they be dogs and swine
(as often they are) and bloody men, such as Ioab, they ought not; yea, they
never were by any Law of God, admitted to the Temple and Sacraments, what they
did, de facto, or the Priests permitted, is not the question. It was David's
sin that he took not away the head of bloody Ioab when he killed Abner and
Amasa. 2. How does Erastus prove that David neglected to punish the incest of
Absolon (his sinful neglect in not punishing his murder I yield) for Absolon
was never in David's power to punish after he committed that incest; possibly he
neglected to punish his own Concubines, that is but a conjecture. It is as
like Absolon forced the Concubines to that incest as any other thing. 3. For
that Psalm. 14. There is none that does good; it is spoken of the natural
corruption of all mankind, who therefore cannot be justified by the works of
the Law, as Paul expounds it, Romans 3. 9, 10, 11, 19, 20, 21. and not of
scandals punishable by the Magistrates; and where this corruption did break
out, in bloods within the Church, it ought to have been punished, both by the
Magistrate and Church: so it is an argument yet, a facto ad jus, and a great
inconsequence. 4. I ask for what cause does the Spirit of God rebuke killing
of the Children to Molech, and coming that same day to the Temple? Because it
was a sin and particularly a profaning of the Sanctuary, which was one
special holy thing to God, Ezekiel. 23. 38, 39. Ier. 7. 8* 9, 10, 11. It was no
sin to come to the Temple: Sure it was commanded of God in his Law, as Erastus
yields. What was the sin then? to come with their hands full of blood, and of
the unnatural blood of their own Children was the sin; and yet if they had
repented, to come after they had killed their Children, was no sin, nor any
profaning of the Sanctuary of God. Then all their sin was, that being
Morally unclean, they came to the Sanctuary; Ergo, God forbade such bloody men
to come to his Sanctuary; because God forbids all sin in his perfect Law;
Ergo, those that deserved to dye by the hand of the Magistrate for open
murder, deserved for that open murder to be debarred from the holy things of
God, what ever Erastus say on the contrary.

Erastus. The adversaries contend, that some are to be excommunicated Page 341.
who deserve not to dye; as if any to a light injury, add contumacy; But they
should have a warrant for this, for this is a contradiction. (Every one who is
clean according to the Law, should keep the Passover) and this (some who is
clean according to the Law, (to wit, who lives wickedly and scandalously, and
yet is Ceremonially clean) should not keep the Passover.)

Ans. We find no distinction made by Christ, Matthew. 18* and therefore we make
none; He that offends his brother, (Christ makes no exceptions of light or
small offenses) if he cannot be gained by admonitions, and be contumacious
against the Church, he is reputed as a heathen and a publican; and this is our
warrant. 2. Let Erastus answer this contradiction according to his own way.
Every one who is Ceremonially clean should come to the Temple. Some who are
Ceremonially clean, (to wit, who the same day have slain their sons to Molech)
should not come into the Temple. The affirmative is holden as a truth by
Erastus. The negative is the word of the Lord, Ezech. 23. 38, 39. 3. It is no
contradiction which Erastus proposes: For every one who is Ceremonially clean,
should not keep the Passover, except also he be Morally clean: For he that
discerns not the Lords body, should not eat; and the Lamb was no less
Sacramentally the Lords body, then the Bread and Wine is his body, so the
former is false, in rei veritate. The latter, to wit, Every one Ceremonially
clean should not keep the Passover, to Erastus is false: Now of two
propositions contradicent, both cannot be false, Erastus may know this is bad
Logic.

Erastus. The Prophets rebuked the abuse and profaning Erast. l. 6. c. 2. p.
341.
of the Sacraments, but they interdicted none circumcised of the use of the
Sacraments, they said the sacrifices of the wicked were no more welcome to God,
then if they offered things forbidden (dogs and swines blood) to God, but they
never say the Priests are to be accused for admitting such into the Sacraments.
They accuse and rebuke the Priests that they transgressed, and taught not the
people aright, but never that they admitted such into the holy things of God:
The Prophets say always those things are wicked before God, but not in the
face of the Church.

Ans. If the Prophets rebuked the profaning of the Sacraments, then they also
forbade profane men to use the Sacraments, could the Prophets rebuke any thing
but sin? Ergo, they forbade the sin which they rebuked: Ergo, they forbade
the man that had murdered his son to Molech, to come to the Sanctuary while
he repented, for they could not rebuke but what they forbad. 2. If the bloody
man's coming to the Sanctuary in that case, was nothing more acceptable to God,
then the offering of a dog to God; then as the offering of a dog to God, was
both forbidden to the people and to the Priest, so was the people and Priest
both accused for the bloody man's coming into the Temple, the one should sin in
coming, the other in admitting him to come. 3. The Priests are expressly
accused for this, Ezekiel. 22, 25, 26. and 44. 23, 24. Hag. 2. 11, 12, 13. 4.
Those were not only sins in foro Dei, before God, for so when they were
secret, they were sins before God, but when openly known, as Jer. 7. 9, 10,
etc. Ezekiel. 23. 38, 39. they were the Priests sins: The bloody are forbidden to
come to the Sanctuary; what then? were not the Porters whose calling it was to
hold out the unclean, to debar all whom the Lord forbade to come? Certainly,
they excluded to their knowledge all whom God excluded, else how had they the
charge to keep the doors of the Lords House? and the Priests are not only
rebuked for not instructing the people, but for erring in governing, Ier. 5.
31. they are not Prophets, but Priests and Governors both Ecclesiastical and
civil, that the Prophet complains of, who did rule with rigor and cruelty
over the people, beside that they feed not the flock but themselves, Ezekiel. 34.

Erastus. Though ill doers be not killed by the Magistrate, Page 341.
yet it follows not that God for any such cause (deserving death) would have
them debarred a recto usu, from the right use of holy things by some that are
not Magistrates, nor are manifest Idolaters, Apostates, and Heretics, though
they be not put to death by the Magistrate, to be debarred by these fancied or
imaginary Presbyters.

Ans. 1. Erastus takes ever for confessed, without any probation, that it is
rectus usus, the right use of the holy things of God, that men with bloody
hands use them, which is (...): a most false principle, for he that kills his
children to Molech, and that same day comes into the Sanctuary of God, is so
far from the right using of the holy things of God, that the Lord says
expressly, his coming in in that condition to the Sanctuary is, (says the
Lord,) the profaning of my Sanctuary, Ezekiel. 23. 39. is this rectus usus
Ceremoniarum? the right use of the holy things of God? It is not: 1. It is a
forbidden use of holy things, Isa. 1. 13. Mat. 7. 6. Mat. 5. 23. 2. It is a
rebuked use of holy things, Erastus 341 sequitur (si faci^orosi sint arcendi ^
Sacrament is) eligendos esse qui malis interdieant oratione, lectione,
Elcemosynarum distributione, etc.
Ier. 7. 9, 10, 11. Isa. 66. 3. 3. It is a profaning of holy things, Ezekiel. 23.
38, 39. 4. It is such a use as brings damnation to the party that uses it, 1
Cor. 11. 27, 29. and it is all these quoad externa, in external things. 2.
Erastus could yield they be debarred, but by the Magistrate, not by Imaginary
Presbyters. But all his Arguments, (as I show before) do prove they should be
debarred, a recto usu, from the right use of holy things by no man, no more
then they should be debarred from giving of alms, or reading the word, this is
Erastus his own Argument; I pray you may the Magistrate, or any on earth by
any authority inhibite a Malefactor, or a Murderer, who ought to die by the
Magistrate, to read the Word, to give alms, to pray for mercy to God, because
he has killed a man? 3. If heretics, apostates, open idolaters are to be
debarred, by whom shall they be debarred: Erastus, page 207. thinks they
ought The Magistrate cannot admit, to, and debar from the Sacrament.
not to be admitted to the Sacraments, who shall debar them? The Magistrate,
(says he) But the Magistrate himself is the apostate, the heretic, the
idolater. 2. He that may debar from the seals, may admit to the seals; he
that may do both, Ex Officio, is the formal dispenser of the seals by office,
that the Magistrate is not: He that may put out, or take in into the house by
supreme power, is the Lord of the house: He who by office may admit some to the
Table, and debar other some, is the Steward. But the Magistrate is neither
the lord of the Church, nor the steward of the house, by office. We do not hold
this consequence; the Lord commanded ill doers to be killed; Ergo, He ordained
in that same commandment, that they be Excommunicated? Nor do we say all those
who were to be Excommunicated, were to be killed, as Erastus says: Nor that
Excommunication in the New Testament succeeds in place of killing in the Old
Testament; we see no light of Scripture going before us in these.

Erastus. It is a wonder that you say, that the godly Magistrate Page 346.
does procure the external Peace of the Commonwealth, but not the salvation
of the subjects, that the Presbyters do only care for.

Ans. The Sword is no intrinsecall mean of the saving of any The sword no
intrinsecall mean of gaining souls.
man's soul: It is true, the godly Magistrate may procure a godly life; but as a
cause removens impedimentum, removing idolatry, heresy, wolves and false
teachers from the flock, and commanding under the pain of the Sword, that
Pastors do their duty. But Christ ascending on high, gave Pastors and Teachers
to gather a Church; but not Magistrates armed with the Sword.

Erastus. The Magistrates Sword is a most efficacious mean to bring Page 347.
men to the knowledge of God, nothing more effectual then affliction, and the
cross, when right teaching is joined therewith; examples teach us that in
danger of death, men have seriously turned to God, who before could be moved by
no exhortations. But you say all die not in the Lord, nor repent; nor (say I)
do they all die in the Lord, who are taken away by diseases, or are
excommunicated; yea, Excommunication makes many hypocrites.

Ans. 1. Erastus here extolleth the Sword of the Magistrate, as a more
effectual mean to salvation, then exhortations or the Gospel: But I read that
Pastors are the Ministers by whom we believe, and that they are workers with
God, and fellow-builders; and Fathers to convert, edify to salvation, and
beget men over again to Christ, 1 Cor. 3. 5, 9. 1 Cor. 2. 4, 15. Ambassadors of
God, 2 Cor. 5. 20. Friends of the Bridgroome, 2 Cor. 11. 2. Ioh. 3. 29. Angels,
Rev. 2. 1. But I never read any such thing of the Magistrate, and that the
Gospel is the power of God to salvation, Romans 1. 16. The arm of the Lord, Esaias
53. 1. Sharper then a two edged sword, lively and mighty in operation, Heb. 4.
12. You never read any such thing of the Sword of the Magistrate, the rest are
before answered.

Erastus. Some may be changed in a moment, as the publican, Luke Page 348. 349.
18. Z^cheus, The repenting woman* Luke 7. If therefore they profess
repentance, they are not to be debarred from the Lords supper.

Ans. Put it in form thus; Those who may be changed and translated from
darkness to light in a moment, and say, that they repent, are to be admitted
to the Lords supper: I assume, But dogs and swine, and doggish and furious
persecutors* who are to be debarred from the Sacraments: As Erastus says, page
207. may be changed in a moment, and say they repent; Ergo, those are to be
admitted to the Sacraments, who are not to be admitted to the Sacraments* let
Erastus prove the Major proposition. 2. We find no such sudden change in the
Publican, Zacheus, or the repenting woman, as Erastus seems to insinuate. 3.
Christ who knows the heart, and can change men in a moment, can at first
welcome persons suddenly converted; Ergo, Must the stewards and dispensers of
the mysteries upon a (may be) or a (may not be) reach the pearls of the Gospel
to dogs and swine, whom they see to be such? It is a wide consequence, He that
brings his gift to the Alter, may in a moment be changed; Ergo, He should not
leave his gift at the Altar, and go and first be reconciled to his brother; He
is presently without more ado to offer his gift, his heart is straighted in a
moment, if we believe Erastus. But the rather of this; that the man is in a
moment changed: He is to be debarred, least his scandalous approaching to use
the holy things of God, make the work of conversion suspicious to others. 4.
This argument presupposes that unvisible conversion, gives a man right in
foro Ecclesi^ in the Churches court, to the seals of the Covenant, and so there
should be no need of external profession at all, which is absurd.

Erastus. Shall not then idolaters and apostates be debarred? as w^ (says he)
deny an idolater* and an apostate to be a Member of the Church of Christ; so we
think the man that defends his wickedness, is not to be reckoned amongst
the Members of the Church; An^ as we think the former are to be banished out of
the society of Christians, so we think the latter are not to be suffered in
that society.

Ans. The Idolater that makes defection, and the apostate were once Members of
the Church; what has made them now no Members? Who should judge them, and cast
them out? the Magistrate? I answer, there is no Christian Magistrate: If the
Church must do it, here truly, is all granted by Erastus, that he has disputed
against in six books, even this very Excommunication. But if there be a
Christian Magistrate; what Scripture is there to warrant that he should cast
out a Member out of Christ's body? Here is an Excommunication without precept,
promise, or practice in the word; we read that the Church of Corinth
congregated together, has a command to judge, and cast out a scandalous
Member, 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5, 11, 12, 13. out from amongst the midst of them: Let
Erastus say as much from the New Testament, for his Magistraticall casting ou^.
2. What reason is there by Erastus his way, for casting out an idolater, and a
man that defends his own wickedness? 1. May not God convert those suddenly;
as he did the thief on the cross, and Saul? Ergo, They should not be cast
out. 2. The Magistrate cannot more cut off those from being Members of Christ's
body; then he can remove their faith and internal communion with Christ. Now
for this cause Erastus says, the Church cannot Excommunicate, page 1. 2 Thessalonians.
3. and 4. 3. Christ and the Apostles did neither cast out Judas, nor Scribes,
Pharisees, or Publicans out of the Church, though they were worse then
idolaters. 4. No helps of salvation are to be denied even to idolaters, and to
men that defend their own wickedness, but their remaining in the Church
amongst the godly, is a help of their salvation; and God inviteth them to
repentance, and the staying in the Church; And the Sacraments are to Erastus
means of repentance, and this casting out must be to save them: for no power is
given of God to the Magistrate or Church for destruction, but for edification*
Now to put them out of the Church, that they may be saved, is as Erastus
conceiteth, to cast a lascivious Virgin out of the company of chaste Matr^ns,
to the end she may preserve her chastity: I speak here all in the language of
Erastus, who uses all those against casting any out of the Church, by
Presbyters; but they stand with equal strength, against his casting out of
idolaters and apostates out of the Church, and so do the rest of his Arguments:
Therefore this conclusion of Erastus is a granting us the whole cause; after in
six books, he has pleaded none should be Excommunicated, he falls on
Bellarmines Tutissimum igitur, etc. when he had written six books against
justification by faith*

Lastly, why should idolaters, apostates, and obstinately wicked men be
excluded from the dispute of Excommunication and suspension from the
Sacraments: for he knows that Beza, and Protestant Divines do make these the
special, though not the whole subject of the dispute: Now Erastus concluding
his six books, does hereby profess he has never faithfully stated the
question, when he excludes those from the subjectum questionis, who especially
hears not the Church, and ought to be Excommunicated. Thus have I given an
account, as I could, of the wit of Erastus, against the freedom of the
Kingdom of the Lord Jesus.

CHAP. XXIII. Of the power of the Christian Magistrate in Ecclesiastical
Discipline.
QUEST. XIX.
Whether or no the Christian Magistrate be so above the Church in matters of
Religion, Doctrine and Discipline, that the Church and her Guides, Pastors, and
Teachers, do all they do in these, as subordinate to the Magistrate as his
servants, and by his Authority? Or is the spiritual power of the Church,
immediately subject to Jesus Christ only?

WE know that Erastus who is Refuted by Beza, The Church as the Church not
subordinate to the Magistrate.
Vtenbogard, whom Ant* Walens Learnedly Refuteth, Maccovius opposed by the
Universities and Divines of Holland, Vedelius Answered by Gu. Apolonius and
others; and the Belgic Arminians in their Petition to the States, and Hu.
Grotins against Sibrandus Lubert. Diverse Episcopal Writers in England do hold,
That the Guides of the Church do all in their Ministry by the Authority of the
Christian Magistrate: I believe the contrary: And 1. We exclude not the
Magistrate who is a keeper of both Tables of the Law, from a care of matters of
Religion. 2. We deny not to him a power to examine Heresies and false Doctrine:
1. In order to bodily punishment with the sword: 2. With a judgment not
Antecedent, but Subsequent to the judgment of the Church, where the Church is
constituted. 3. With such a judgment as concerns his practice, lest he
should in a blind way, and upon trust, execute his office in punishing
Heretics, whether they be sentenced by the Church according unto, or contrary
to the word of God as Papists dream. 3. We deny not, but the Prince may command
the Pastor to Preach, and the Synod and Presbytery to use the keys of Christ's
Kingdom according to the Rules of the Word: But this is but a Civil
subjection, though the object be spiritual: But the Question is not* 1.
Whether the Christian Magistrate have a care of both Tables of the Law. 2.
Whether he as a blind servant is to execute the will of the Church, in
punishing such as they discern to be Heretics; we pray the Lord to give him
eyes and wisdom in his Administration. 3. Nor thirdly, Whether he may use his
coercive power against false Teachers, that belongs to the controversy
concerning Liberty of Conscience. 4. The Question is not, Whether the
Magistrate have any power of jurisdiction in the Court of Conscience, they
grant that belongs to the Preaching of the Word: But the Question is,
touching the power in the external Court of Censures. 5. The Question is not,
Whether the power of exercising Discipline be from the Magistrate, I mean in a
free and peacable manner, with freedom from violence of men: we grant that
power, and by proportion also, that exercise of Discipline is from him: But
whether the intrinsecall power be not immediately from Christ given to the
Church; this we teach, as the power of saying peacably from danger of Pirates
and Robbers is from the King; but the Art of Navigation is not from the King.
But the Question is, whether the Magistrate by virtue of his office, as a
Magistrate, has Supreme power to Govern the Church, and immediately as a little
Monarch under Christ above Pastors, Teachers, and the Church of God, to Judge
and determine what is true Doctrine, what Heresy, to censure and remove from
Church Communion the Seals and Churchoffices, all scandalous persons, and that
if Pastors, or Doctors, or the Church, Teach or dispense censures, they do it
not with any immediate subjection to Christ, but in the Name and Authority of
the Magistrate, having power from the Magistrate as his servants and delegates?

To this we answer negatively, denying any such power to the Arg. 1.
Magistrate, and do hold, that the Church, and Christ's courts and Assemblies
of Pastors, Doctors, and Elders, has this power only and immediately from
Jesus Christ, without subordination in their office, to King, Parliament, or
any Magistrate on earth by these Arguments. 1. Because in the Old Testament,
the Lord distinguished two courts, Deuteronomy. 17. 8. If there arise a matter too
hard for thee in judgment, 10. Thou shall come unto the Priests, the Levites,
and unto the Judge that shall be in those days, and inquire, and they shall
show thee the sentence of judgment. And thou shall do according to the
sentence, which they of that place (which the Lord shall choose) shall show
thee, etc. There be here two Courts clearly, one court of Priests and Levites
that were Judges; another of the Judge: Now the King by virtue of his Kingly
office, might not usurp the Priests office. 1. Vzziah was smitten with
Leprosy for so doing. 2. It is evident in Moses his writing, that Aaron and
his sons the Priests and Levites were separated for the service of the
Tabernacle, to teach the people, to carry the Arc, to sacrifice, to judge the
Leper, and to judge between the clean and Ezekiel. 44* 15.
the unclean, to put out of the camp, out of the congregation the unclean, and
to admit the clean, Lev. 1. 7, 9, 12, etc. and 5. 8. and 7. 7. and 13. 3, 4,
etc. 23. Numb. 5. 8. etc. and 18. 4, 5. 2 Chronicles. 29. 11. You has the Lord
chosen to stand before him, 1 Samuel 21. 1, 2. Lev. 21. 1. Josh. 3. 8. 1 Kin. 8.
3. 1 Chronicles. 8. 9. 2 Chronicles. 5. 7. and 7. 6. and 8. 14. Zeph. 3. 4. Hag. 2. 11,
12. Mal. 2. 7, Deuteronomy. 10, 9. and 21. 5. Number. 1. 29. Deuteronomy. 10. 8, 18. Numb. 1.
50. and 3. 9, 12, 41. and 8. 10. Psalm. 122. 5. In Jerusalem there were set
thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David, Mat. 22. 21. Christ
commanded to give to Caesar the things that are Cesars: and he in his own person
refused to usurp Cesars place, Luke 12. 14. Man, who made me a Judge? and
interdicted his Apostles thereof, Luke 22, 24, 25, 26. and yet appointed for
them a Judicature of another kind, Mat. 18. 15. Mat. 16. 19. Ioh. 20. 21. 1 Timothy 5. 17. Heb. 13. 17. 1 Cor. 5. and if any should deny that the Civil
Magistrate had another Court in which he judged, the Scriptures will refute
him. 3. It is evident that Iehoshaphat did not institute, but restore those two
courts, 2 Chronicles. 19. 11. And behold Amariah the chief Priest is over you in
all matters of the Lord, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael the ruler of the house
of Judah, for all the Kings matters; never any Erastian could satisfy either
themselves or others, to show us what were those two courts, so distinguished
by their two sundry Rulers. Amariah and Zebadiah, the one a Priest, the other a
Magistrate. 2. By the different formal objects, the matters of the Lord, the
matters of the King, and confounded they must be; if the King and Ruler be a
judge in the matters of God, except God make him both a civil judge and a
Prophet, as were Moses and Samuel, which yet were differenced when the God of
order established his Church in Canaan. The Church convenes for a Church
business, Josh. 18. 1. to set up the Tabernacle, but for a civil business,
to make war, the State conveneth, Josh. 22. 12. 15. 16. Judge. 21. 12. and Ier.
26. 8. there is the Church judicature discerning that Jeremiah was a false
Teacher, and they first judge the cause, and v. 16. The Civil Judicature
discerns the contrary, and under Zorababel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, they endured
different judicatures; Jesus Christ was arraigned before Caiphas the High
Priest for pretended blasphemy, before Pilate the civil judge for treason,
but Caiphas was to determine only by Law, in questione juris whether it was
blasphemy which Christ had spoken, but he had no power by Gods Law to lead
Witnesses or condemn Christ. Nor is it true, that the Priests had their
government only about Ceremonialls, for they were to judge of Moral
uncleannes also, which even then debarred men from the holy things of God, as
is clear, Hag. 2. 12. Ezekiel. 44. 9. 10, 23, 24. and if any say that the
Magistrate amongst the Jews did judge of Ecclesiastical things, and reformed
Religion: We answer extraordinarily, the Magistrate might prophecy, and did
prophecy, as did Samuel, David, Solomon: Why do not Erastians bring those
examples to prove that Kings, Provasts, Justices, may now preach the Word, and
administer the Sacraments, which yet is unlawful to them by grant of
Adversaries, for the examples of the Kings amongst the Jews, is as strong for
preaching, as for governing; and because Prophets did judge the people of old,
yet no Protestant Divine Government peculiar to the Officers now, as to the
Priests and Levites of old.
will say, that now Pastors may also usurp the civil Sword.

Now least any should object the case is not alike in the Jewish and Christian
Church, surely the King of the Church has no less separated such men as Paul
and Barnabas for the Ministry now, then at that time, Romans 1. 1, 2. Act. 2.
And sent laborers to his vineyard, Luke 10. 2. Matthew. 20. 2. and 9. 37, 38.
And Ambassadors to Preach in his Name, 2 Cor. 5. 20. Ministers of Christ, and
Stewarts of the mysteries of God, 1 Cor. 4. 1. Men sent of God, whose feet are
pleasant for their good News, as were the Prophets of old, who were not only
gifted to preach, but instructed with Divine Authority, as is clear Romans 10.
14. 15. Isa. 52. 7. and 40. 9. Nahum 1. 15. Yea, and men that feeds the flock,
not only by Preaching, but also Govern the Church, so that they must take heed,
that Ravening Wolves creep not into the Church, who shall not spare the flock,
Act. 20. 28. 29. Men who must be obeyed because they watch for our souls, Heb.
13. 17. And can govern the Church, as well as they are apt to teach, 1 Timothy 3.
5. 2. Men that labor amongst us, and are over us in the Lord, 1 These. 5. 12.
And men who are to call to the work other faithful men that are able to teach
others, 2 Timothy 2. 2. Such as are separated from the affairs of this life, such
as Magistrates are not, 1 Cor. 6. 3. such as Rule well, 1 Timothy 5. 17. and are
not to receive accusations, but under witnesses, and are to lay hands suddenly
on no man, not to call them to the holy Ministry till they be sufficiently
tried, 1 Timothy 5. 19, 20, 22. all which import teaching and governing. Now if
all these directions be given to Timothy and other Pastors till the The
Epistles to Timothy and Titus must chiefly be written to the Emperor and
Magistrate, if Pastors be but Servants of the Magistrate.
end of the world; then must all these directions be principally written to the
Magistrate as the Magistrate; and these Epistles to Timothy agree principally
to the Christian Magistrate, and to Pastors and Doctors at the by, as they be
delegates and substitutes of the Magistrates; and that, by office, the Emperor
of Rome was to lay hands suddenly on no man, and commit the Gospel to faithful
men who could teach others, and was not to receive an accusation against an
Elder; and certainly, if the Magistrate call to office those that are over us
in the Lord, and if those who watch for our souls, especially, be but the
curates and delegates of the King and Parliament, then the King and Parliament
behoved in a more eminent manner to watch for our souls; for directions and
commandments of God in this kind, are more principally given to the Master,
Lord, and chief Governor of the house of God, (if the Magistrate be such) then
to the servants and delegates* But where is there any such directions given to
the Emperor, King, or Christian Magistrate, by any shadow of ground in the
Word? It is not much to say, The Magistrate was an heathen and an enemy at this
time, and therefore those could not be written to him. For 1. No force can
strain these two Epistles to Timothy, and the other to Titus, which contain a
form of Church-policy to any Christian Magistrate; for then the qualification
of the King, if he be the supreme Governor of the Church should far rather
have been expressed, then the qualification of a Bishop and a Deacon, which is
no where hinted at. 2. All these directions, notwithstanding this, do and must
actu primo, agree to the Mag^strate: for his office who is chief governor, and
what he should be is described in the Word. 3. When Christ ascended on high, he
gave, as a fruit of his ascension, sufficient means for his intended end, The
perfecting of the Saints, the gathering of his Body the Church, and the
edifying thereof, even till we all meet in the Unity of the Spirit, and the
knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man, Ephesians. 4. Now neither in that
place, nor in any other place, did Christ give a Magistrate for the edifying
his Body the Church; but only those that are but his Delegates, Apostles,
Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, Teachers, i^ the Magistrate be the only
Governor of the Church, and he who sends into the Vineyard those who edify
the Body; the King should have been first in this Role, as the only supreme
gatherer, edifier and builder of the Church: It cannot be said, The Ruling
Elder then, because he is omitted here, should not be the gift of Christ, given
to Edifi^ the Church; and by this it must be denied, that the King the Nurse
father of the Church who is to take care that the Children be fed with the
sincere milk of the Word, is given of God to edf^ie the Church, because he is
not name^ here.

gather from this place, that because the Pope pretended to be the Catholic
edifier of the Church, is not here in this Text, nor in any other scripture,
that therefore he is not the head of the Church; and the King, being pretended
to be the only eminent gatherer of the Church, and Supreme Governor in all
Causes, Civil and Ecclesiastical, he should especially have been set down
here, he being a mixed person, and more then half a Church Officer in the mind
of the Adversary: And there was no color of reason, why the supreme and only
Head, and principal Governor of the Church, should be omitted, at least the
Magistrate should be in some other Scripture as the only Church Governor;
seeing the Adversaries make Pastors, Doctors, Elders, and Deacons, only the
Delegates and Servants of the Magistrate. 1. As God calls the King to govern
the people, by the free election of the people; so if the Magistrate be called
of God to teach and govern the Church, this calling of his should be in the
Scripture, as his calling to the Throne or Bench is, Deuteronomy. 17. 14. 15, etc. and
1. 15, 16. Romans 13. Tit. 3. 1, 2. But in neither the Old nor the New Testament
find we any Prince or Ruler separated for the holy things of God, to be `
Priest, Apostle, Pastor, Prophet, Teacher by virtue of his office, as if he
were a mixed person (as the Adversary say.) No David is called to Sacrifice,
no Constantine to preach and Administrate the Sacraments by virtue of the
Magistrates place. 2. If any Reply, that the Christian Magistrate is a means
ordained for that spiritual end, the gathering and edifying the Church, in
regard the keeps not only the second Table of the Law, and so promoteth not
only the Temporal good of the State in promoting mercy and Justice only, but
also in procuring spiritual good to the people in preserving the first Table
of the Law. I Answer, That the Christian Magistrate does both; but 1. Not
directly by being the intrinsecall means, in actibus elicitis, in elicite and
intrinsecall acts, promoting edification in both Tables of the Law, of which
the Scripture speaks, Ephesians. 4 11. but a far other way: 1. In imperated and
commanded acts extrinsecally, as he does command with the sword for Peaces
cause in all calling^, in sailing, trading, painting, etc. promoting it by
carnal means by the sword, which belongs not to the officers of Christ's
Kingdom. 2. Not necessarily, as the Pastors and Elders, without which Christ
has no external visible Kingdom on earth, whereas he has had, and often has
a complete flourishing external visible Kingdom without Magistrates: yea,
where Magistrates have been open enemies to the Gospel. 3. Not directly the
Magistrate does this, but in so far as he admits (as Triglandius says) the
Church of Christ within his State, which he may, and often does refuse to do,
and yet be a complete Trigland. de civi. and Eceles. potest. disser. Theolo. c.

Magistrate; and therefore the Magistrate may two ways procure the spiritual
good of the Church: 1. By procuring that the Nurses give good and wholesome
milk to the Church, 2. Permodum removent is prohibens, which is also a cause,
for he may save the flock from great temptations, when by his sword he drives
away the Wolves from the flock* But not any of these brings the Magistrate
within the lis^ of the number of these intrinsecall, 2. Necessary, 3.
Spiritual gifts, which Christ ascending on high, gave for the Edifying of his
Body the Church.

Two powers so different as spiritual and temporal: 2. As powers Arg. 3.
carnal of this world, and spiritual not of this world: And 3. Both
immediately subject, the one to God the creator, the other to Christ the
Redeemer and Head of the Church, and so coordinate, and supreme both of them
in their own kind, cannot be so subordinate, as the temporal should be the
supreme in the same kind, the spiritual the inferior and subordinate. But
these two powers are so different, as spiritual and temporal, carnal of this
world, spiritual not of this world, the one subject as supreme immediately to
God creator, the other supreme immediately subject to God the redeemer; Ergo,
Those powers of Governing are not so subordinate as the Temporal should be
supreme, the spiritual subordinate to it.

The Major is undeniable, for it involveth a contradiction that two supreme
coordinate powers should be two, not Supreme, Civil and Ecclesiastical
powers immediately from God.
but subornidate powers: The same way I prove the Assumption. 1. The
Magistrates power is supreme from God, Romans 13. 1. The Powers that are be of
God, Prove. 8. By me Kings reign, for no Ecclesiastical power, nor any power
on earth, interveenes between God the Creator, and the power of the civil
Magistrates; But God who gives being to a society of men, hoc ipso, because
they are a society of reasonable men, has given to them a power immediately
from* himself, to design such and such to be their Rulers: Show us any higher
power above the Magistrates, but God the creator making the civil power. Never
man dreamt that the Spiritual power of the Church does interveen as an
isntrumental cause of the politic power. 2. By order of nature, a politic
power is first: men are first men in natural and politic society, ere they be
in a supernatural policy, or a Church; and Christ did not make a spiritual
power by the intervention of a civil power. 2. The power of the two Kingdoms
are distinguished by Christ, John 18. 36. Jesus answered, my Kingdom is not of
this World, (then the power thereof is not of this World,) if my Kingdom were
of this World, then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to
the Jews. The one power is coactive by the Sword, the other free, voluntary by
the Word. Erastus had no reason to infer thence that Christ's Kingdom is only
internal and invisible, not external and visible, because Christ opposes his
Kingdom to a fighting Kingdom, using the sword to defend him from the Jews,
that he should not be taken and crucified, as is clear in the words, but he
opposes not his Kingdom to an external visible Kingdom, for his Church
visible consisting of visible Officers is his Kingdom, Ephesians. 4. 11, 12. 1 Cor.
12. 13 etc. The Word of the Kingdom is audible, and it is visibly professed,
and Ministers are visibly and externally called to the holy Ministry, by the
laying on of the hands of the Elders and voices of the People; but he opposes
his Kingdom to a Kingdom fighting with the Sword, and using the coactive
power of the sword to save him from being apprehended and crucified by the
Jews: Now this is the Magistrates Kingdom, for he bears not the sword in
vain, Romans 13. 4. and so Christ evidently proves in these words, that the
power that bears the sword, which is the very essence of the Magistrates
office as a Magistrate, is not a part of his Kingdom, for his Kingdom is of
another World, and Spiritual; but the Magistrates power is of this World, and
uses worldly weapons, as the sword. Then it is evident that the Magistrate as
the Magistrate, 1. Is not subordinate The Magistrate not subordinate to Christ
as Mediator.
to Christ as Mediator and head of the Church. 2. That when it was said, All
power in heaven and earth is given to the Mediator Christ: The sense cannot be,
the power of the sword was given to him as Mediator, to be a judge and a Ruler
on earth, which he refused, Luke 12. 13, 14. (though as God he has the power
of the sword.) 3. That the supreme Magistrate as Magistrate is not the only
Deputy, Delegate, and Vicar of Christ as Mediator; for if Christ as Mediator
have a substitute and Deputy, such as the Magistrate as the Magistrate, who
bears his bloody sword to cut off the enemies of the Church, and to fight
for Christ: then 1. Christ's Kingdom surely should be of this World. 2. By the
same reason, since as Mediator he is Priest, and a High Priest to offer a
sacrifice to God, as all Priests must do that are proper Priests Heb. 8. 3. c.
9. 7. c. 10. 14. c. 10. 1, 2, 3. etc. there must be Priests under Christ
properly so called, to offer some bloody sacrifice satisfactorie for sin,
which is blasphemy to say, I mean proper Priests; for otherwise in a
figurative and borrowed sense, all beleeevers are Priests to offer themselves
to God, Romans 12. 1. Revel. 1. 5. 6. 1 Pet. 2. 9. but not the Deputies of the
High Priest Jesus Christ, and by the same reason he must have Prophets under
him that are Vicars and Deputies, which is unpossible for Christ as Prophet and
great Prophet, is essentially Lawgiver, and the Author of Cannonick Scripture,
and he who really by a supernatural power teaches the heart, but so he has
no Deputies, nor any Ministers or Prophets, nor any under Lawgivers, or under
Prophets, which by an action or any active power communicated to them, can as
under Lawgivers devise any part of Law or Gospel or any other part of
Cannonick Scripture, or have any active influence supernatural to make a new
heart: Hence all our Divines say, Christ as Mediator and King of the Church
has no Deputies, neither King, nor High Priest, nor Pope, nor Saint. 4. It
must follow, that the Magistrate who as Magistrate bears the Sword, is not
the head officer of the Church under the Mediator; for as Magistrate he must
act with the sword, upon the Church as the Church, and the Ministers of the
Gospel as they are such; whereas when the Magistrate does act as Magistrate on
the Ministers with the sword, he does it on them as men erring and sinning: But
only so he procures as a Magistrate the spiritual good of the Church as the
Church, indirectly and by the sword, in driving away Heretics and wolves from
the flock.

That Church which is the pattern and rule to all the Churches unto Argum. 2.
the end of the world, in those things that belongs to a Church, as a
Christian Church, must be our rule and pattern in Government: But in the
Apostolic Church of Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, Thessalonica, Corinth,
Galatia, Philippi, Colosse, the seven Churches of Asia, planted and framed up
as perfect Christian Churches, by the Apostles, the Magistrate was not the only
supreme Governor of Churches; nor did the Apostles, Elders and Teachers in
those Churches, nor the Church, act, preach, dispense the Sacraments, rule,
govern as servants, under, and through, and from the Authority of the
Magistrate or King, as his Vicars, deputies, and servants; But by immediate
Authority from Jesus Christ placed in them without the interveening mediation
of Magistrates; Ergo, that Church should be the pattern of our Church, though
the adversaries deny the proposition, to wit, that the Apostolic Churches as
Apostolic, should be our pattern in all things in regard that the Magistrates
were then heathens and enemies to the Church and Gospel, and so de facto,
actually, and by accident could not be the supreme officers and Governors of
the Church; yet now, when we have The pattern Church of the Apostles not ruled
by the Magistrate.
Christian Magistrates, that are nursefathers to the Church, and believers
professing the Gospel, such as David, Solomon, Josiah, Iehoshaphat, and
Ezekiah, and other godly Princes of Israel and Judah were, and therefore that
the Church, as it is a General, both to the Jewish and Christian Church,
should be our pattern in Government; yet we have (though I say, they deny this
Major) a great advantage of the adversaries in these. 1. We have the first
Christian Church to be our pattern, and the New Jerusalem that came down from
Heaven, from God, Revel. 21. 10. The mother of us all, Gal. 4. 26. Which is
builded upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself
being the chief corner stone, Ephe. 2. 20. to be our rule and pattern, and all
that was prophesied, though not completely in all the degrees of the Church of
the Apostles, was then fulfilled, as touching the essence of a Church. 2. Yet
here the Magistrate was no chief officer. 3. The adversaries must prove Moses,
David, Solomon, and those godly Kings, as Kings and Magistrates, and virtute
officij, were supreme rulers and Church Officers, and so that Constantine, and
all the godly Princes and Emperors, were, by virtue of their office, as
Magistrates, all such Prophets, as were Moses, David, Solomon: for certainly,
they as Prophets wrote Scripture, had the form and structure of the Temple
revealed to them of God, received Laws from God for the Priests: if our Kings
as Magistrates now can do the like, we shall then say something to their
Headship over the Church. 4. And if they reformed Religion in the time of the
defection of the Priests, when they were holy and zealous, and walked with God,
and did right in the sight of the Lord like unto David, such as Jehoshaphaet,
Josiah, when the Priests were corrupt: we shall grant the like to Parliaments
made up of Josiahs and Ezechiahs; when the Assembly of Divines are corrupt,
Heterodox, and all the Pastors have corrupted their ways. 5. Civil punishing
of Churchmen when they are Erast. and Mr. Pryn grant, that there is such an
ordinance as excommunication.
Heretical and scandalous, we heartily yield to Magistrates. But that
Magistrates as such should Excommunicate and admit such to the Sacrament, and
reject other such, and rebuke, or, that the Magistrate as the Magistrate, did
of old judge between the clean and the unclean, cast out from the congregation
and camp, and receive in, and so govern the Church, is altogether
unwarranttable. Now the adversaries, as Erastus, grant that Idolaters,
Apostates, and Confirm. These. l. 6. c. 2. p. 349. Sane ut ^dololatram and

extremely profane men, are to be cast out of the Christian society, and not
to be suffered there; and also that Dogs, and Swine, and Apostates, and
persecut^rs, are neither to be admitted to hear the Word, nor partake of the
Sacraments: So also Mr. Pryn, if Magistrates must cast them out of the Church
by virtue of their office, and judge as Magistrates who are profane, and who
truly fear God, and who are dogs and Apostates, who not, surely then
Magistrates as Magistrates must discern between the clean and the unclean,
as Priest* of old, and must separate the precious from the vile, as the
Prophets did of old, and so were the mouth of God, and must stand before the
Lord, le^. 15. 19. Then must Magistrates as Magistrates be Pastors called in
the Pulpit as well as in the Throne, and the Bench, and that by virtue of their
calling, which neither Erastus, nor the reverend Mr. Pryn will own. Now if the
Elders of the Church with the consent of the people, must cast such out of the
Church, and from communion in the holy things of God, here is in express
terms the very Ecclesiastical Excommunication which Mr. Pryn denies to be an
Ordinance of God, and yet it must be commanded by Jesus Christ in these words,
Mat. 7. 6. Give not holy things unto dogs, and therefore keep not in Church
communion the profane, and (by the way) Mr. Pryn to me yields the cause, and
grants that Excommunication and suspension from the Sacraments, do both fall
under this precept of Christ, Mat. 7. That which falls under a command of
Christ, to me is a Divine Ordinance. 2. He says also, reasoning against are
suspension from the Sacraments, Obstinate scandalous sinners make no conscience
at all of receiving the Sacrament, and voluntarily suspend themselves
therefrom, in case they be freely admitted to other Ordinances, it being only
the total Exclusion from the Church, and all Christian society (not any bare
suspension from the Sacrament,) which works both shame and remorse in
excommunicate persons, as Paul resolves 1 These. 3. 14. 1 Cor. 5. 13. compared
with 1 Cor. 1. to v. 10. 3. This is, in terminis, excommunication proved from
diverse places of Scripture, for it is a total Exclusion from the Church, and
all Christian society, working shame and remorse as Paul resolves: We seek no
more, Paul's resolution to us is a Divine right. Those words of that Learned and
Reverend man have (give me leave by the way to say, for I hope worthier then I
am, do answer fully all he has said in this subject) all that we crave. For 1.
obstinate men will voluntarily suspend themselves from the Sacrament: Ergo, the
Church should not suspend them only, but also Excommunicate them; I grant all,
if they be obstinate, they are to be not only suspended, but also
excommunicated; Ergo, they are not solie and only to be suspended, Pro hac
vice, for this time; it follows no ways, all that this Reverend Lawyer says
against sole suspension from the Sacrament of an obstinate offender, is nothing
against us; if he be obstinate, he is not only to be suspended from the
Sacrament, but also if he go on in refusing to hear the admonitions of
brethren, and of the Church, he is to be excommunicated; Ergo, he is not first,
hac vice, to be suspended from a confirming Ordinance given to those only who
are supposed to have the life of faith, and can only eat and drink
spiritually and by faith the body and blood of Christ; It follows not. I
think Mr. Pryn would not have Heretics and Apostates suddenly and at the
first totally (as he says) excluded from the Church, and all Christian
society, sure we owe some gentleness and patience even to them, If God
peradventure may give them Repentance to escape out of the snare of the Devil, 2 Timothy 2. 24. 25, 26. yet if an Heretic and Apostate that same day that the
Lords Supper were to be celebrated should deny the Resurrection, and Jesus
Christ to be God blessed for ever, and not equal with the Father, nor
consubstantiall with him, and withal should that same day have offered his
child to Molech, and yet profess his desire to come to the Lords Supper,
professing he had tried and examined himself, and his desire to come to eat
and drink with Jesus Christ the great Prophet of his Church; Would not Mr.
Prynne think he should not be admitted to the Lords Supper, and yet that he
should not totally be excluded from the Church, and all communion from the
Church and holy things of God? I should think if he cannot be presently
excommunicated, yet he should not be admitted to the Sacrament, for sure he
cannot but be in a doggish and swinish disposition in one degree or other: And
my reason is, he is as Erastus says, non recte institutus, not rightly
instructed, but heterodoxe, and so cannot try and examine himself, while he be
better principled in the faith: so a suspension for a time from the Lords
supper, and ex natura rei, without total exclusion from the Church and all
Christian society, were as necessary, (whether the Magistrate or Church
suspend, I dispute not now) as a degree of punishment, or a preventing of
eating of damnation is necessary hi^ and nunc: O, but says Master Prinne,
Christ knew that Judas was worse than an heretic, and yet he denied not to
admit him to the Supper; Ergo, though we knew such a one, the Sacrament being a
converting Ordinance, it follows not that we should debar him from the
Sacrament.

Ans. Whether Judas did eat the Supper of the Lord, or not, I think nothing of
the matter; only Master Prinne has duram provinciam, and a very hard task to
prove it from Scripture, If I were to examine his book, I should deny his
consequences from the Evangelists, for not any of them can prove that Judas did
communicate at the last Supper. But, 1. Christ's example in this being an act of
Christ, as God, permitting the greatest hypocrisy on earth, is no rule to the
Church to give the Lords Supper to Iuddasses; First, Judas was visibly and
infallibly to Christ, a man who deserved to be totally excluded out of the
Church and all Christian society, and to Christ a known traitor, a Devil, an
hypocrite; Ergo, as Christ did not exclude him out of the Church; neither
should the Saints now exclude from their society; nor should the Christian
Magistrate (as Erastus and Master Prinne thinks) exclude Iudasses and known
traitors, and known Devils, and known children of the Devil out of the
Church; this is to Erastus and Master Prinne both absurd. 2. Christ did eat and
drink with Judas knowing him to be all these; Ergo, we may eat and drink with
known traitors also, the contrary is a truth, 1 Cor. 5. 9, 10. 11. 2 Thessalonians. 3,
14, 15, Romans 16. 17. evident enough. 3. Christ preached the Gospel to those
that he knew sinned against the Holy Ghost, to the Pharisees who persecuted
Christ to death and others, Math. 12. 31, 32, 33, 34. Ioh. 15. 22, 23, 24, 25.
Ioh. 7. 28, 29. Ioh. 12. 35, 36, 37, 38. Ioh. 10. 31, 32. Ioh. 11. 47, 48. and
this is by the exposition of Erastus l. 3. c. 3. page 307. 308. and Master
Prinne his vindication, page 38, 39. To give holy things to dogs: so Mr. Prinne
says, that by dogs and swine, are meant only such infidels and heathen, who
refuse to embrace and believe the Gospel, or harbor or entertain the preachers
of it, (of which the text is principally intended) as well as the Sacraments,
or of such open contemners, persecutors of the Gospel and Ministers, who run
upon and tear the preachers thereof, trampling the pearls of the Gospel, and
the tenderers of them under their feet, as the Text resolves in terminis, Mat.
7. 6. Mat. 10, 14, 15. Luke 9* 5. Act. 13. 46. or open Apostates. 2. Pet. 1. 2,
21, 22, etc: hence by this we may give the pearls of the Gospel to such dogs as
the Pharisees, for to them Christ tendered the pearl of the Gospel. 4. Christ
might have hindered, being God equal with the Father, the Pharisees and Jews to
malice him; Ergo, he being above the Laws that he gives to us, does not in this
example warrant us to cast the pearls of the Gospel to such as we know to be
Iudasses, Pharisees, and malicious haters and heart-murtherers of Christ. 2.
There is not the like reason The Gospel preached to those to whom the
Sacraments cannot be dispensed.
of preaching the word, and dispensing the seals, 1. Because the word is a
converting ordinance out of question, and preached to heathen and to the
non-converted, though they refuse to embrace and believe the Gospel, and refuse
to entertain the preachers of it: as is clear, Act. 19. 22, 23, 24, 25. Tit.
1. 10, 11, 12, 13. 2 Timothy 3. 25, 26, 27. The Texts that Master Prinne
alleges, that the Gospel should not be preached to heathen who refuse to
embrace and believe the Gospel, to wit, Mat. 10. 14, 15. Luke 9. 5. Act. 13.
46. are to no purpose, for Mat. 10. Luke 9. is but a Temporary Commandment,
given for a time, that the Disciples should depart from those houses of Judea
(there is nothing of the heathen; But by the contrary the Apostles are
forbidden to go to Samaritanes or Gentiles at all, Mat. 10. 5, 6.) who would
not receive the peace of God in the Gospel, which precept the Apostles in the
story of the Acts, did not observe; but preached the Gospel to many heathen who
refused to embrace and believe the Gospel: As Act. 16. and 17. and 19. 2. The
place, Act. 13. 15. is meant of the blaspheming Jews, to whom Paul preached
long after they persecuted and stoned the Prophets, and had killed the Lord of
life, Act* 2. and 4. and 8. and 9. Mat. 23. 37, 38. 3. Those places, are to
better color of purpose brought by Arminians, and Socinians to prove, that the
Gospel is preached to people for their good entertainment thereof, and denied
to others for their unworthiness, and because they will not welcome it; So the
Arminians in the conference at Hague, page 87, 88, 89. God sends the Gospel
not according to his absolute will, sed ob alias causas in homine latent^s, for
secret causes in man. Arminius against Perkins. p. 199. The will of God in
sending the Gospel, has causes in the will of man according to that, habenti
dabitur: So Corvinus ad Wallachros, p. 44. Socinus Comment. in 1. Epist. Ioh.
c. 4. p. 307. says the same: and Mr. Pryn is pleased in the same sense to cite
them, I conceive imprudently, for I believe that Reverend and learned man does
hate those impious Sects, the Enemies of the grace of God; but truly if this be
a rule to Pastors to spread the Gospel, that they are to offer and give the
pearl of the preached Gospel to those that willingly receive it, and harbor
the preachers, and presently to depart and preach no more the word of the
Kingdom to those who refuse it, as the places Mat. 10. 14. and Luke 9. 5. carry
that sense, because they are Heathens who refuse to embrace and believe the
Gospel, and harbor the Preachers, as (the worthy Divine says,) conceiving
that to be a casting of Pearls to Dogs and Swine; I see not how the Preachers
and spreaders of the Gospel to the Heathen, are to believe that God out of mere
grace, and the good pleasure of his will, without respect to good or bad
deserving, sends the Gospel to some, and denies it to others. 3. Though the
Sacrament of the Supper be a converting Ordinance in this sense, that it
corroborateth faith and conversion, where it was once, and so applies the
Promises to one who before believed, yet it is not a converting ordinance, that
is to be administered to one dead in sins and trespasses, as the word is, for
then at the first Sermon that ever is preached to a Heathen, if he should say,
though for base and worldly ends known to the Church that he desired to have
the Sacraments, we are obliged to believe that he sincerely desires these
Seals, and The Sacrament a confirming ordinance.
instantly at the same sermon to baptize him, and administer the other Seal of
the Lords Supper to him; for how can we deny converting Ordinances to those who
desire them? say our adversaries. 4. An ordinance that cannot be dispensed to a
Heathen, remaining a Heathen, and to an unconverted man known to be an
unconverted man, is not an Ordinance that ought to be dispensed, as the
ordinance of the Word, and as the first converting ordinance, to so many as we
may safely dispense the Word unto, and if it be first a converting ordinance,
as the preaching of the Word is; then it is to be dispensed to all those to
whom we are to preach the Word. But Erastus and Mr. Pryn grant, we may preach
the Word to Heathen remaining Heathen, and if they deny it, (as they yield it)
the Apostles did preach the Gospel to the Heathen remaining Heathen, but they
never admitted, nor can we admit to the Lords Supper Heathen remaining Heathen,
nor could the Jews upon the same ground, admit to the Passover the
uncircumcised: now then the preaching of the Word to some cannot make the
Church and preachers guilty of casting pearls to Swine, and of partaking of
their si^, whose hearing is not mixed with faith; and yet if the Church and
Ministers should admit to the Sacraments Heathen remaiing Heathen, they should
prostitute holy things to Dogs, and be guilty of an Heathen man's eating of his
own damnation; Hence this Assertion of Mr. Prynne must be a great mistake,
That Vindication p. 35.
Ministers may as well refuse to preach the Word to such unexcommunicated,
gross, impenitent, scandalous Christians, whom they would suspend from the
Sacrament, for fear of partaking with them in their sin, as to administer
the Sacrament to them, because (says he,) unprofitable hearing is as damning a
sin, as unworthie receiving of the Sacrament: 1. Because there is and may be
discovered to be in the congregation, persons as unworthy as Heathen, such as
Simon Magus, yea, latent Iudasses, Parricides, who are in the visible Church
while God discover their hypocrisy; but we may lawfully preach the Word to men
as incapable of the Word as Heathen, and as unworthie; as Christ and the
Apostles did, who did not contravene that, Cast not Pearls to Swine, yet we
cannot give the Sacraments to men known to be as scandalous, incapable, and
unworthy as Heathen; but we must prostitute holy things to Dogs, and partake of
their sin; for this is non causa pro causa, that Mr. Prynne brings, to say
we may as well refuse to preach the Gospel to scandalous impenitents, as to
administer the Sacrament, without partaking of the sins of either, because
unprofitable hearing is as damning a sin, as unworthy receiving the Supper;
This Because is no cause: it is true, they are both damnable sins, but how
proves he that Preachers partake equally of both* I can show him a clear
difference which demonstrateth the weakness of this connection. 1. Unprofitable
hearing of the Gospel in a Heathen is as damning a sin, as hypocritical
receiving of the Sacrament is a sin, they are not equalia peccata, but sure
they are ^que peccata; but I may preach the Gospel to a Heathen, and not
partake of his sin of unprofitable hearing, for I may be commanded to preach
to a Heathen remaining a Heathen, as Paul preached to Felix, to the scoffing
Athenians, to the persecuting Jews, We partake of the sins of many in
dispensing to them the Sacrament, and not in preaching to them the Word*
and giving obedience to the command of God, freeth me from partaking of his
unprofitable hearing; But I cannot administer the Lords Supper to an Heathen
remaining a Heathen, without sharing in his sin; and suppose a Heathen
remaining a Heathen would crowd in to the Lords Table, as of old many Heathen
fained themselves to be Jews, desiring to serve the time, 1 Samuel 14. 21. yet I
should partake of the Heathens unworthy receiving, if knowing him to be a
Heathen serving the time, and crouding in amongst the people of God, I should
administer the Lords Supper, because I have no command of God to administer the
Lords Supper to a Heathen man, nor could Paul administer the Sacrament to the
scoffing Athenians, or to Felix, without taking part with them in their
profaning of the Lords Table. 2. The necessity of preaching the Word, it being
simply necessary to the first conversion of a sinner, puts Pastors in a case
that they may, and ought to preach the Gospel to Heathen, and to thousands
known to be unconverted without any participation of their unprofitable
hearing, and the non-necessity of the Lords Supper, or the Seal of the
Covenant, and the nourishing of their souls to life eternal, who visibly and
to the knowledge of those who are dispensers of the Sacrament, profane, and
abominably wicked, puts those same dispensers in a condition of being
compartners with them in the profaning of the holy things of God, if they
dispense the bread to those that are knowingly dead in sins, so the Gospel

26, 27. Genesis 18. 19. Prove. 22. 6. because there is a necessity they be saved by

the contrary, that the Lords Supper be dispensed to no children, nor to any
that cannot examine themselves, and they may be saved without the Sacrament,
but not ordinarily without the Word; nor were it enough to forwarne Apostates,
and persecutors, and Hypocritical heathen, and children, that if they eat
unworthily they eat their own damnation, as Mr. Pryn says, and yet reach the
Sacrament to those, Vi^d. p. 36
for the dispensers then should ^ast Pearls to some Dogs and Swine contrary to
Mat. 5. 6. and they should be free of the guilt in polluting of holy things, if
they should give them a watchword, say they were about to profane the holy
things of God, before they committed such wickedness. Nor do we as Mr. Pryn
says, nor know we, or the Scriptures any such distinction, as sealing
externally to the senses of any receiving the Lords Supper, lawfully divided,
(sinfully it may be divided, but there is no Law for sin, no print, no
authority of men for it,) from the internal sealing, nor heard we ever of two
sorts of conversion, one external from Vindication p. 40. 41.
Paganism to the external profession of the faith, wrought extraordinarily by
Miracles without the Word, and ordinarily by Baptism in Infants* and another
internal from formal profession, to an inward embracing of Christ and his
merits. 1. Because the Stewards and Ambassadors of Christ, may notdare to play
with the Sacraments as children do with nuts, to seal to men's senses and
fancies Christ and spiritual nourishment in him, and part in his body broken
and blood shed, in those who visibly have nothing of faith to their discerning,
and of the life of Christ, but only senses and fancy, such as all visibly and
notoriously scandalous walking after the flesh, all Herericks, Apostates,
known and unwashen Hypocrites have, and no more. 2. All heathen and unbaptized
have senses, and are capable of external washing, and external and
Sacramental eating, as well as others are, but are they capable of the Seals,
because they have bodies to be washed, and teeth and stomach to eat
Sacramentally? And have Ministers warrant enough to dispense the Sacraments to
all that have senses? But they must be within the visible Church also, ere they
be capable of Sacraments, Mr. Pryn will say; but I ask by what warrant Mr.
Pryn alleges that the Supper of the Lord is a converting ordinance as well as
the Word, and that Pastors may without sin dispense the Sacraments to those
to whom they preach the Word, but they may preach the Word to Heathen remaining
Heathen; Ergo, may they dispense the Lords Supper to Heathen remaining Heathen?
What more absurd? yet, remaining Heathen, they are as capable of Mr. Pryn his
sense-sealing, and sense-converting Sacraments, as any sound believer. 3. A
sealing to the senses cannot be divided from the inward sealing by the Spirit;
neither in the intention of God, for the external sealing without the
internal is Hypocrisy, and God cannot intend Hypocrisy, nor can this
division be in regard of the nature of the Sacrament, for it does seal to us
our spiritual nourishment in Christ, except we sinfully separate the one from
the other, and sin is no ordinance of God. 4. What word of Christ has Mr. Pryn
for extraordinary conversion of men by Miracles We know no extraordinary
conversion by Miracles without the Word.
without the Word? He must conceive with Arminians and Socinians, that many are
converted that never heard of that precious name of Jesus, without which there
is no salvation, Act. 4. 11. or of a faith in Christ, as Moses Amyraldus
dreameth, without the knowledge of Christ, and may write books de salute
Ethnicorum, for this external conversion does lead of its own nature to
internal conversion and salvation: This may make us fancy somewhat of the
salvation of Aristotle, Seneca, Cicero, Aristides, Scipio, Regulus, without the
Law or Gospel, this way of extraordinarily saving men by Miracles without the
Gospel, is the doctrine of Arminians and Socinians; so say the Arminians at
the Synod of Dort* page 334, 335. Those whom God has deprived of the Gospel,
he has not precisely rejected them from a communion of the benefits of the
Gospel. Adolphus Venator. adver. Dracenos p. 84. says, The heathen are saved
without the Gospel, if they ^^n but pray, Ens Entium miserere mei, Socinus
praelec. Thelo. c. 3. tells us of an inspired word that saves us, called

Divine faith cannot be produced by Miracles. Andradius says often they may be
false. Maldonatus says, That no necessary argument of faith can be drawn from
Miracles. Gregorius de Valen. says, Miracles give us no infallible certainty
of Doctrine. Bellarmine says, Miracles cannot convince Bellarm. de lib. arb.

the mind. Durandus gives a sure reason why miracles cannot produce faith;
Because (says he) suppose it were known of it self, that this miracle of the
raising e. g. of Lazarus were true, yet it is not known by it self, that it
testifies that this is a true Doctrine which he preaches who works the
miracle. Mr. Prynne then has put the salvation of those who never heard the
Gospel upon extraordinary Pillars, when he bottometh them on miracles without
the word, which are extraordinary rotten Pillars.

5. The Lords Supper, of which we now dispute, is not the mean of The Sacrament
of the Supper not a first converting ordinance; ye^ a confirming one it is.
our first conversion, from formal profession, to inward embracing the Gospel:
For the word must go before, and not simply the external letter of the word;
but the word first believed and received by the efficacions working of the holy
Ghost: And so the word is indeed the first converting Ordinance; and so the
Lords Supper is given to one who already believes, and the Sacrament concurreth
as a mean to make good, corroborate, and increase the conversion which was
before. Mr. Prynne might have spared his pains in proving, That the Lords
Supper is a converting Ordinance, because it applies Christ ^o u^: we grant it
to be a converting, and quickening, and lively applicatory Ordinance: But how?
He may know that what ever Ordinance adds a new degree of Faith of
conversion, of saving application of Christ and the Promises, must be a
converting Ordinance: But it is so converting, that it is a confirming
Ordinance, The Lord Supper presupposes faith and conversion in the worthy
receiver in Churchprofession.
and necessarily it presupposes Faith and conversion already wrought by the
word; it is not a first-converting Ordinance, such as is the word; but as
nourishing or accretion is a sort of vital generation in the body of a growing
child, so as Physicians make nutrition in children to be Aggeneration, or,
Congeneration, or a vital generation with, or in the body, and it presupposes
the first generation, by which life is given to the child; now nourishing does
not give life, things void of life are not capable of nourishing; therefore
nourishing is the continuing of life, and as it were prorogated and continued
generation: so here, Sacramental eating by faith, is a spiritual feeding and
nourishing of the soul on the crucified Lords body broken, and his blood shed,
it is not the act of our first conversion: Regeneration is sealed in Baptism,
and Christ given as sealing and confirming Regeneration; but the Lords Supper
is that which exhibiteth Christ to us as food, and seals our spiritual
growing and coalition in Christ: I say not this, as if the Church could give
the Supper of the Lord to none but such as are inwardly and really Regenerated,
but to show that the Church takes such as are externally called, to be
internally called when they dispense this Supper to them; and that they are
nearer Christ then those that hear the Gospel (which Heathen may do) ere they
can be admitted to the Supper. And this Erast. every where, and Mr. Pryn, in
terminis teach Vindicat. page 2. 3.
when they say, That those that are recte instituti, rightly instructed, who
earnestly desire the Lords Supper, profess sincere Repentance, and promise
amendment, are only to be admitted to the Sacrament, and those only excluded
who are convicted to be gross and scandalous, and obstinate offenders. Whence
it is clear they profess Repentance, and to the Church they are converts, who
are to be admitted to the Supper before they come to the Lords Supper: Now this
must be done by the word Preached, and received by faith in profession; Ergo,
this Supper in the Church Way, cannot be dreamt to be a mean of their first
conversion, far less in foro Dei, in Gods court, can men first receive the
Lords Supper having never heard the word, and then be converted in foro Dei,
really and inwardly, by receiving the Lords Supper; then might the Sacrament,
before and without the word, be given, if it be a converting Ordinance
belonging to all to whom the word belongs: For Mr. Prynne says, It can be
denied to none within the visible Church. And what reason, if it be no less
the first converting Ordinance, but that it may be administered to those that
never heard the word, and are Members of the visible Church? And by this Mr.
Prynne cannot deny, but the Lords Supper should be dispensed to infants and
children, who cannot try themselves, nor yet discern the Lords Body: Yea, those
that are convicted of obstinacy in scandalous sins, are Members of the Church;
for how could they be judged, convicted and sentenced, if they be not within? 1
Cor. 5. 12. Ergo, their being Members of the Church, is not enough to admit
them to the Lords Supper, except they be to the Church otherwise qualified and
fitted for it. And this does clearly evidence, That the word of the Kingdom
may, and ought to be Preached to many within the Church, that they may be
converted to whom the Supper is not to be dispensed, that they may be
co^verted, which is enough for our point to exclude promiscuous admission of
all to the Supper; and to prove some other qualification must be requisite, in
those that come to the Supper before the Ministers, (without violation of the
holy things of God, and being guilty of not distributing aright) can administer
the Supper to them* and this is another visible qualification then is requisite
in those that hear the word: For Erastus and Mr. Prynne require, That all that
come to the Supper be rightly instructed. 2. That they promise amendment of
life: But they cannot say, none are to be admitted to hear the word, while they
be qualified thus; you exclude the ignorant from the Sacrament, do you exclude
the ignorant from hearing the word? Farther, I desire to be resolved, why
Erastus and his require any qualification at all in the one, more then in the
other, according to their way: For suppose persons Baptized be only negatively
blameless, and not visibly scandalous; yet Erastus and Mr. Prynne cannot deny
the Supper to such. Suppose they know not whether they be as ignorant of God as
Indians, and suppose they promise no amendment, and do positively profess no
repentance at all: 1. Ministers can deny no converting Ordinances to persons,
because ignorant; for if the Supper of the Lord be a converting Ordinance, it
shall convert men from their ignorance; and an Indian ignorant of Christ, ought
to be Baptized, to the end, that Baptism may convert him from his ignorance.
Now I think our Brethren cannot say this, and therefore they must yield, that
Ministers dare not admit all within the Church to the Seals, except they would
be guilty of their sin, in eating to themselves damnation; and yet they dare
not debar the ignorant within the Church from hearing the word, and so are no
way compartners with them in the sin of unprofitable hearing. 2. Mr. Prynne may
here see some ignorants debarred from the Lords Supper; yet I hope he would not
be so rigid as to Excommunicate all ignorants, because ignorant: the most rigid
Novatians would condemn that: and here is sole suspension without
Excommunication, which Mr. Prynne says is not to be found in all the word of
God.

I wondered much when I read those words of the learned and Vindicat. page 41.
reverend Master Prynne: That God, who bestows no Ordinances on men in vain,
must intend in instituting the Supper, that visible moral unregenerate
Christians, may be converted thereby, as well as real Saints be confirmed: to
which I reply: 1. Neither word nor Sacraments, nor any thing on the part of the
Almighty can be intended in vain, though the end of the Ordinance be not
obtained, I should have expected some such divinity from the pen of Arminians
and Socinians, who make God to intend the salvation of all, and every one in
both the promises of the Gospel, precepts and Sacraments, and yet he falls
from this end: so you may read, in Arminius Anti-Perkins, page 60. that God is
disappointed in his end, in both Law and Gospel, and God shooting beside his
mark misseth the salvation of many, say the Remonstrants at the Synod of Dort,
page 216. and in their confession, c. 7. sect. 3. and because Socinus thought
it hard thus to take from God wise intentions; he did no less then
blasphemously deprive him of his omniscience: So Socians contra puccium, c. 10.
and in prelectionib. Theolog. c. 11. made all things that are contingently to
come, uncertain to God: But if you speak of intentio operis, non operantis,
that the Supper, in its nature, is ordained (this may rather be your meaning)
that moral men like Cicero, and Seneca, and Judas, and the like, (for all are
alike in regard of the nature of the ordinances, and of that which is the
genuine intention not of God, but of this Sacrament) then you speak not of the
supper as divided from the word, but as the word going before the Sacrament
has converted the man, and the Sacrament following does add to and confirm
in grace. So, Sir, you depart from the question, for we grant that the Sermon
going before in the same day of the celebration of the Supper, may, and does
convert; and thus if an Indian hear a Sermon, to which the celebration of the
Supper is annexed, if he be converted by that Sermon (as you teach the heart in
those, is only known to God, the Church is not to judge) he may forthwith, ere
he be baptized, come at the same time to the Lords supper, which were much
precipitation, little speed, and so the word formally converteth, not the
Sacrament; But if you mean that the Sacrament formally, as the Sacrament is of
its nature a mean of converting a moral Seneca, you mistake the nature of the
seal, very far, God never intended that food as food should give life to the
dead, the Supper as the Supper is spiritual food, and presupposes the eater
has life, and how gate he life but by the word of God? 2. Does the Sacrament
as the Sacrament humble or speak one word of the Law? does the Sacrament say
any thing here, but Christ died for thee, O Seneca, and there is a pledge of
his love in dying for thee; and the like it speaks to Judas, as Master Prinne
thinks, and can this convert a moral man never yet humbled for sin? But I
have gone thus out of the way in this purpose, I return and desire pardon for
this digression, not (I hope) fruitless at this time.

If the Magistrate be the chief Church Officer, how is it that the Church was
without Christian Magistrates in the Apostles time? then is there no exact
pattern of a Christian Church, what it should be, de jure? has Christ in the
New Testament not molded the Church, the second temple in all the dimensions
of it, as Moses, David, Solomon, did by immediate inspiration show us the
measure of the first Tabernacle, Sanctuary, and Temple? finally should Caesar,
suppose he had been a Christian, have received imposition of hands from the
Elders, a^ his deputies the Ministers do? and be over the Church in the Lord as
King? and receive accusations against Elders, ordain Elders in every Church,
put out and cast out the unworthy? only for the iniquity of the time, Ministers
were forced to do these? Erastus and his have not one word of Scripture for
this, or were the keys of the Kingdom of heaven given to Caesar? and because
Caesar was without the Church, therefore Peter received them, Matthew. 16. while
Caesar should be converted, what Scripture have we for this? for to rule the
Church as the Magistrate does, is an act of the Magistrate performed by power
of the sword: Whether the Magistrate do rule in his own person, or by his
deputies and servants; Ergo, the Apostles governing the Church meddled with the
sword, which Christ forbade, Luke 22. 25, 26. Romans 13. 4. Luke 12. 13, 14. and
all the Pastors and teachers now in the exercise of discipline do usurp the
sword; Yea, if they be the deputies of the Magistrate in dispensing word and
Sacraments, they must use the Magistrates sword as Ministers of the Gospel; for
what servants do in the name of the supreme swordbearer, that the swordbearer
must principally do by the servants, so Ministers by this use both swords.

5. That the Magistrate cannot be the chief officer of the Church Arg. 5.
is thus proved, he who is subject himself to hear the Church, and to submit
to those that watches for his soul, and to be put out from amongst the midst
of the Church; if he be scandalous, is not the principal Governor and head of
the Church to command all: But all Christians, and so the Christian Magistrate
is such, for if God accept not the persons of men, those places, Matthew. 18. If
he hear not the Church, etc. Heb. 13. 17. and 1 Cor. 5. 1, 2, 4, 12, 13. must
tie the Christian Magistrate, except God have excepted him; but God has no
where excepted the Magistrate, But as David had The Magistrate subject to the
Church.
Gad, Nathan and other See^s; so the Magistrates now have some to watch for
their souls. The proposition is proved, because if the Magistrate be supreme to
command Elders as Elders, both in Doctrine and discipline, and in all
Ecclesiastical censures, then the Magistrate as the Magistrate cannot be under
the Elders and Ministers as such, for that involveth a contradiction; that
Pastors as Pastors should watch over the souls of Magistrates that they err
not, and oppress not in judgment, and that the Magistrate as Magistrate
should be over the souls of Pastors to watch for them in the same kind; if any
object that the Pastors as Pastors have souls, and therefore they must have
some to watch for their souls; and therefore can neither be supreme, nor
excepted in those places, Mat. 18. Heb. 13. 1 Cor. 5. It is answered by
granting all of this or this single Pastor, but not of the whole company; for
when they err, we know not a whole community over them, but those of the
Catholic visible Church; and if they err, the Kings of the earth here may
command them to do their duty under pain of bodily censure, and punish them:
But none are above them to watch for their souls, that we know; but they by
office, watch both for their own souls, and for the souls of others, even as
the King governs himself and the people both politically.

6. Whatever power in matters of Christ's Kingdom or the Government Argum. 6.
thereof, the Magistrate has, that must be given of Christ, who only can
appoint Elders and officers over his own house, but no where in Scripture find
we any such power given to the Magistrate; Ergo, we are to believe he has not
any such power. The proposition is true, because Christ being a perfect
Lawgiver and King, does give Laws for his own house, as particularly as Moses
did for every several pin in the Lords Tabernacle, and David and Solomon for
the Temple: the assumption I prove; because the Government of Christ's house is
spiritual, as the weapons of their warfare are not carnal, 2 Cor. 8. 5. and
it is in binding and loosing, forgiving and retaining sins, by the power of
the keys of the Kingdom of God given to the Church, and to such as are sent,
as the Father sent his Son Christ, Matthew. 18. 18. and 16. 19. Ioh. 20. 21, 22,
etc. But Magistrates as Magistrates do punish sins with the sword, Romans 13.
4. but not forgive sins, nor bind and loose in earth or heaven, nor exercise
any spiritual power, nor deal with the consciences of men, no more then they
cure the diseases of the body, though indirectly and externally they take care
that there be Physicians who can cure diseases.

The power of governing the Church is the supreme power under Christ, which can
say to the Magistrates power, We must obey God, rather then men: But no such
supreme power agrees to the Magistrate as Magistrate: For Ministers as
Ambassadors of Christ, can and may preach, bind and loose, Rebuke,
Excommunicate against the will of the Magistrate, though he command the
contrary, as Prophets have rebuked Kings, Jer. 1. 18. and 22. 1, 2. 2 Samuel 12.
7, 8, 9. 1 King. 21. 18, 19. Mark 6. 17, 18. The Magistrate as the Magistrate
can do none of these: nor has he power to command the Ministers of Christ by
way of privation; but only by way of accumulation he may command them to do
their dury, and to preach the Gospel soundly, and forbid and punish the
preaching of false Doctrine the same way.

Whatever power Christ has given to his Church, that the Arg. ^. The church a
perfect society without the Magistrate.
Christian Magistrate, when he becomes Christian, cannot take from the Church:
But Christ gave to the Churches of Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, to the
seven Churches of Asia, etc. a full power to dispense the word and Sacraments,
to govern the Churches, to censure Wolves and false Teachers, who draw
Disciples after them, in Synods to condemn perverters of Souls, and refute
their Doctrine, to put out incestuous persons, to Excommunicate such as will
not hear the Church, and a power to reject a Heretic after twice admonition,
and to rule well the Church, as they should rule their own house, and to rule
well, and to labor in the Word and Doctrine, etc. when they had no Magistrates
at all to rule and govern them as a Church. Now if the Church be a perfect
visible body, society, house, city, and Kingdom of Jesus Christ, in esse and
operari, in being and all Church-operations; then the Magistrate, when he
comes to be Christian, to help and nourish the Church, as a father he cannot
take away and pull the keys out of the hands of the stewards, and throw the
rod, authority, power to rule, govern, bind, loose, convene in Christ's courts
and Assemblies from the Church, and inthrall the Church: This evidenceth how
falsely some say, That the Church as the Church is without a Magistrate, as an
Army without a Commander or Vtenbogard.
Leader, a Ship without a Pilot, a body without a head. When the Church in the
Apostles times wanting a Magistrate, was a perfect spiritual body, gathered,
edified, attaining to the unity of faith, Ephesians. 4. 11, 12, etc. 1 Cor. 12. 28.
Romans 12. 4, 5, etc. Builded upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles,

5. Yea, the Churches had rest throughout all Judea, and Galile, and Samaria,
and were edified, walking in the ^ear of the Lord, and in the comforts of the
holy Ghost, and were multiplied, Act. 9. 31. Now if the Christian Magistrate be
their only Head and chief Feeder, and all Elders but his servants, Edifying a
and sub Magistratu, from and under the Magistrate: How were they edified, and
the complete house of God, the house wanting a head, and the Church of the
living God, without the chief feeder and shepherd the Magistrate, when all
this time the Lord set spiritual Pastors and watchmen over them? It is true,
it might be some defect, that they wanted a Christian Magistrate, who was their
Nurse-father and keeper, and avenger of both Tables of the Law: But this defect
was 1. A defect of the Church, as men who may be injured, and do violence one
to another as men, if they want one who bears the sword to be avenged on evil
doers: But it is no defect of the Church as the Church. 2. There might be some
defect in the Church as a Church, in this regard, that without the Magistrate
his accumulative power, the edification of the Church extrinsecally might be
slower, Church Laws less vigorous extrinsecally without the sword, and evil
doers might infest the Church more; but there should be no privation or
intrinsecall defect, or want in the Church, either of an officer, or integrall
part of the Church, because they wanted the Magistrate. 3. When the first

three hundredth year, the Churches wanted Christian Magistrates* afterward
Constantinus convocated the Council of Nice against Arrius, yet professing
that he was Episcopus, without. After him the Empire being divided into three,
Constantinus, Constantius, and Constans, the second adhered to Arrius and
oppressed the godly. Constans and Constantinus lived not long: Though Jovianus,
Theodosius, elder and younger, Gratianus, Martianus, were favorers of the
Church, yet most of the Northern Kings were persecuters. In the sixth hundredth
year, they began to be obstinate favorers of Heresy. In the West
Antichristianisme, in the East Mahumetisme rose; for the most part the Church
wanted godly Magistrates, and always has wanted.

Whatever power or means of life Christ has given to his Church or pastors for
the edifying of their souls, either in Doctrine or Discipline; by these is the
holy Ghost efficacious on the hearts and conscience of the people of God, as
immediately given by Jesus Christ, without the mediation or intervention of any
other means. But Christ has given power and means of life to preach the word,
to admonish, rebuke, Excommunicate to the Church and Pastors, by which the holy
Ghost works efficaciously on the hearts of the people of God, which God has
given immediately to the Church and Pastors, especially in the Apostolic
Church, when there were no Magistrates; and the holy Ghost is no ways
efficacious in the hearts of the children of God, by the Laws, Statutes, and
sword of the Magistrate; Ergo, God has given to his Church and Pastors, and
not to the Magistrate, power and means of life, in which the holy Ghost is
effectual, and that immediately and not to the Magistrate. Or thus: Whoever is
the supreme officer and head of the Church, having under him all
Church Officers as his servants, by such God is effectual in the consciences
of men: But Pastors, Teachers, Elders are such, and no ways the Magistrate:
Ergo,

The Proposition is thus made good by the word of reconciliation, and the rod
of the Lords power in the hands of men: The holy Ghost works efficaciously in
men: Now the question will only be, to whom this word of reconciliation is
committed, and the rod of God; the Scripture says to the Ministers, never to
the Magistrate, 2 Cor. 5. 18. And has committed to us the word of
Reconciliation* ver. 20. Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, 2 Cor. 10. 8.
Though I should boast somewhat more of our Authority which the Lord has given
us for edification, 2 Cor. 2. 13. If I come again I will not spare, 1 Cor. 4.
21. What will ye? Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love? 1 Timothy 5. 17.
Act. 20. 28. 29. 30. 1 Cor. 5. 12. Do not you judge them that are within?
Matthew. 16. 19, and 18. 18. Ioh. 20. 21, 22. This word is no where committed to
the Magistaate, nor is the holy Ghost efficacious by the Laws and sword of the
Magistrate to convert souls; we know not Magistrates to be Ministers by whom we
believe, but Ministers only, 1 Cor. 3. ver. 5. Nor is the sword a kindly and
intrinsecall mean of conversion. This Argument may be further confirmed by all
the notable differences that the Scripture holds forth to be between the
Magistrate and the Ministers and Church: As 1. The Church judges only those
that are within the Church, 1 Cor. 5. 11, 12. The heathen Magistrate

may judge both those that are within and without the Church, and every soul is
under his power, Romans 13. 1, 2, 3. Tit. 3. 1, 2. 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2, 3. 1 Pet. 2.
13, 14, 15. Matthew. 22. 21. And by these same Scriptures, the Christian
Magistrate being a lawful Magistrate, having under him both believers* and
heathen, may and ought to judge both; Ergo, the Magistrate as the Magistrate
cannot judge those that are within, by the word as the Church does, but only in
some common coactive way, by the sword, to compel them to do their duty. 3.
The Magistrates Kingdom is of this world, and he may fight with his sword to
defend his own subjects, and his subjects may fight for him: But the Church and
Kingdom of Christ, are not of this world, nor can the Church as the Church, and
the Ministers thereof fight or use the sword, as is clear, Joh. 18. 36. Romans
13. 4. The Magistrate bears not the Sword in vain: but he bears the sword
in vain over the consciences of men, or to judge those that are within; for the
Church judges those that are within, with no such weapon as the bloody Sword;
There is neither sword nor dagger, nor any weapon of War required in the Church
of Ephesus, their censuring of grievous Wolves or false Teachers, Act. 20. 28,
etc. Nor in the Apostles and Elders determining truth against perverters of
souls, Act. 15. 21, 22, etc. and 16. 4. Nor in the Church of Thyatira, their
not suffering Jezabell to teach, Rev. 2. 20. Nor in Pergamus, their not
suffering those that held the Doctrine of Balaam, Rev. 2. 14. Erastus l. 4. c.
6. p. 285. says, The Church can kill no man with the Sword. There was no sword
ever dreamt of in rejecting an heretic after the first and second admonition,
Tit. 1. 10. Let our Adversaries show what influence the Magistrates sword has
here: yea, (say they) The Magistrate may banish the heretic ou^ of the Church.
True.

Ans. Not out of the Church as the Church, but out from amongst his subjects as
his subjects, whom he is to defend in peace and godliness. 2. It is evident
Titus had no power of the sword, but was an Evangelist: Paul wrote not to Titus
to banish the heretic, the rejecting here is a spiritual censure performed by
previous admonitions. 3. What can the Magistrate as the Magistrate do to this?
4. The Magistrate is a Lord, and has by Gods appointment a Lordly dominion
over those that are under him; the Minister is only a Minister, a Servant, a
Preco, or Herald, and has dominion in the Church, Luke 22. 24, etc. Now those
over whom the Magistrate has a civil dominion as a Magistrate, over those he
may exercise that Lordly dominion of the sword: But the Magistrate as the
Magistrate, may use no Lordly dominion of the sword over the Church as the
Church, to Preach, Exhort, Rebuke, Admonish, Excommunicate, to judge those that
are within, as the Church may do, 1 Cor. 5. 12. Ergo, the Magistrate as the
Magistrate, cannot be the supreme and highest Church officer, having under him
Church officers, as his servants and deputies to Preach and censure as, a and
sub, under and from him, because as a Magistrate he carries not that which
has any power over the conscience, that is, he carries no^ the word of the
spirit, as a Magistrate, but the sword bodily to punish evil doers. 5. He who
by office is chief overseer and watchman in the Church, he must by office keep
his own vineyard, and not be put to keep the vineyard of others, Cant. 1. 6. He
must watch for the souls of those, whom by office he keeps as one that must
give an account, Heb. 13. 17. He must as a special watchman by his office,
Take heed to grievous Wolves not sparing the Flock, speaking perverse things,
Act. 20. 29. And, as a watchman he must blow the Trumpet, and give early and
seasonable warning to the people of the sword, Ezekiel. 34. 1, etc. Yea, he must
watch for the souls of ministers and teachers, and by office, rebuke, admonish,
censure, and punish them, and by office judge of their Doctrine and Discipline,
and is over the people in the Lord, and to admonish them, as 1 These. 5. And
worthy of Honor for well Ruling, 1 Timothy 5. 17. But these the Magistrate as the
Magistrate cannot do. 1. He keeps another vineyard of the Civil state, he is
not Pastor to the Church as the Church, over which the Holy Ghost has set him,
Act. 20. 28. 1 Peter 5. 1, 2, 3. he is not to give an account for the soul^,
and for the souls of Pastors by his office, he may as a Christian be his
brothers keeper, to teach, admonish, Col. 3. 15. and exhort, Heb. 3. 13. he is
not by office to blow the trumpet, as Ezekiel was, Ezekiel. 33. 7, 8. Ezekiel. 3. 17,
18, 19, 20. he is not over the people in the Lord to admonish them as a
Magistrate, as a Magistrate he only is either to praise and reward well doing,
or take vengence on evil doing, Romans 13. 4. nor does Paul think Nero, 1 Timothy
5. 17. worthy of double honor, all those are proper to Church Officers, the
proposition is necessary; because if the Magistrate be the eminent and supreme
watchman over the Pastors, as his under deputies and servants, then must the
Magistrate more eminently keep the vineyard, and watch for the souls, both of
Pastors and people, feed the flock over which the Holy Ghost has set him, be
over the people in the Lord, be worthy of double honor, as one that rules
well, and is worthy of double honor; and that by office: Now 1. The word never
warranted him in the Old Testament, to sacrifice, to burn incense to Minister
before the Lord, to carry the ark: But God separated the Priests and Levites
for this only; and was it such a sin for Vzziah to burn incense; and for
Vzziah to touch the Ark, and for any to bear the Ark but the Levites? and are
not these things written for our instruction? are we all now to bear the Ark?
and are we all to dispense the word and Sacraments? When Paul will not have
women to teach in the Church, and when God has no less in the New Testament
separated some by the laying on of hands, and appointed a Ministry in the New
Testament then he did in the Old? 2. Where has God in Old or New Testament set
down, that all those qualifications, in an eminent manner, and as principally
due to the Magistrate, as he has described the qualification of the officers
of the New Testament in the Epistles to Timothy and Titus, and the Ephesians,
Chapter 4. v. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. 1 Timothy 2. 1 Cor. 12. Romans 12. 3. Did Christ
put upon Church Officers in the New Testament, all the proper titles,
privileges and peculiar Characters of their calling, as they are the deputies
of Claudius, Tiberius, and Nero; so they had been Christian Princes? this the
adversaries must prove, and must all the Epistles of Paul to the Churches of
Christ, and of James and Peter, John and Jude, which concern Church Officers be
written: First and principally to the heathen Emperors, as they be Church
Magistrates, and Churchofficers jure, though they be in very deed enemies of
the Gospel, de facto? It must put Erastus and all his to pains to prove, that
Magistrates as Magistrates were separated in the Old Testament to sacrifice, to
burn incense, to bear the Ark of the Lord, and Priests and Levites, and
Prophets, were only the under servants and instruments of Kings, and the like
they must do in the New Testament: But this is carefully to be observed; that
the adversaries, though they speak of Government, and some yield, as Master
Prynne does, that there is such a thing as Excommunication, especially, 1 Cor.
5. yet the truth is, they deny all Church Government: for I desire to know, why
they give to Ministers of the Gospel a power to try who are heretics,
apostates, and unworthy partakers of the holy things of God; Yea, such as may
ordain Ministers, and reject heretics after admonitions; if Jesus Christ has
given this power of Government beside preaching the word, I ask, quo jure, by
what Scripture, if by no warrant of Christ: then it is unjustly given to them,
and the Apostles and Teachers then had no right to it; if there be a right,
that by office Pastors should know what is soundness in the faith, and
integrity of conversation; and so who are to be called to the Ministry, who
not, who are to be excluded totally from the Church, as Erastus and Master
Prynne say, who not; Then what warrant has the Magistrate to limit the The
Magistrate cannot limit the pastor in the exercise of his calling.
Ministers of the Gospel in this Government, such as it is, more then in
dispensing the word and Sacraments? Surely except the Magistrate put his hand
to the Arc without warrant in the one, he cannot in the other. They answer,
the Magistrate may limit the Pastors in preaching, no l^sse then governing,
because he may command the Pastor to preach this and this, and if he preach not
sound Doctrine, he may punish him; but I answer, this is no limitting of
Pastors in preaching; Because this the Pastors may in the name and authority of
God, exhort the Magistrate to execute righteous judgment, Ier. 22. and if he
crush the poor and needy, and turn a tyrant, an heretic and an apostate; the
Pastors may not only denounce wrath from the Lord against them, but also judge
them dogs and swine, See Henr. Salcobrig. in Becano. Bac. p. 140. Ait regem
esse primatam Ecclesia Anglicanae, and rege^ s^cro olc^ uncti capaces sunt
spiritualis jurisdictionis, Rex propri^ autorite creat. Episcopus. See Called. ^u
altar. Dam. p. 14, 15, 16. seq. That Magistrates are more hot against punishing
of sin by the Church, then against sinful omissions, which argues that they
are unpatient of Christ's yoke, rather then that they desire to vindicate the
liberty of the subject in this point.
and not dispense to them the pearls of the Gospel, yet this is not the Pastor
limiting the Magistrate as the Magistrate does limit the Pastor, as his
Ambassador and Deputy, though the Magistrate take care that Physicians,
Painters, Shoomakers, Professors in Academies and Universities do their duty
in their calling, and punish them, if they therein do amiss, yet he limiteth
not the painter to draw this way, not this way, nor has he a negative voice in
acts of Art, as he pretends a negative voice in Church Discipline. 2. Nor can
the Pastor so command the Magistrate in the name of God, to execute justice, as
if he become a tyrant, an heretic, an apostate, he will not only remove him
from the Throne, and the Bench, but he will set himself down in the place of
the erring Magistrate, and judge righteous judgment for him, or in his place:
for Erastus says that the Magistrate may dispense word and Sacraments (if he
had time and leisure) as lawfully as the Pastor; and I have in another place
observed, that many so make the King head of the Church (and the like must be
said of the little heads of inferior Magistrates, as of the great head) as he
is a mixed person, partly Civil, partly Ecclesiastical and sacred, that is,
by office, Ruler and Pope. 3. The Magistrate does limit the Pastors only in
positives, and in punishing and inflicting Church censures, as they command to
censure scandalous persons in such and such scandals, but in no other scandals
more heinous; yet in all the challenges moved by Magistrates against Pastors,
The Magistrate never made any challenge against Pastors or Synod, for their
sinful omissions and want of zeal in not censuring drunkards, adulterers,
heretics, court parasites, who enjoy many benefices, and leave the flock, and
I give instance, in the disputes of the Divines of England making the King the
head of the Church; court-divines accused never the Pastors that they exceeded
their limits in not censuring corrupt Prelates, non-residents, pluralists, idle
and unpreaching Pastors, or idolshepherds. 4. In the contests of Holland, when
the Synod of Frizland gave in a declinature to the Senate, justifying the
deposition of Poppi^ an unsound and scandalous Minister, in all contests with
Arminians there, the controversy was ever for positives, that the Church
condemned and censured heretics, never that the Church had been slack in the
matter of discipline. 5. In Scotland in Master Blackes declinature, and when
the Ministers condemned to death and then banished, such as the godly and
zealous servants of Christ, Master John Welsh, Master John Forbes, and others
appealed to the assemblies of the Church, for their standing for the liberties
of the Church and Kingdom of Christ. King James did never quarrel with them,
Thus you have not done in your Ministry, and Assemblies, you have not
excommunicated the Marquess of Huntly a bloody man; but it was for positives,
Thus and thus you have done against the mind and Majesty of the King and
Authority. Now corrupt Pastors need as much to be limited in wicked omissions,
as is clear: You are dumb dogs and bark not, Isai. 56. 10. And the diseased
ye have not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, etc.
Ezech. 34. 4. as in exorbitances, in their positive zeal; And this says, that
Magistrates intend to intrude upon Christ's liberties, in this plea, rather then
indeed to procure that the house of God may be builded and edified, or the
liberty of the subject vindicated. And therefore the godly ought the rather to
stand for the freedom of the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus, which owe not this
tribute to earthly Princes; since Christ only is King, and reigns in his own
Church.

CHAP. XXIV.
Quest. 20.
Of the reprocation of the subordination of the Civil and Ecclesiastical
powers to each, and their supremacy and independencie each from other.

FOr the clearing of the question, I humbly offer these considerations to the
Reader.

1. There is subordination of the power, and a subordination of the person
endued with the power, here to be considered.

2. So is there a supremacy of power, and a supremacy of the person.

3. There is a four fold judgment here considerable; 1. The first is
apprehensive (apprehensivum) and common to both Magistrate, Christian, Pastor,
and all which must be given to all to whom we can ascribe conscience. 2.
(Discretivum) the knowledge of discretion, the connaturall guide and principle
of every man's belief and obedience. 3. (Definiti^um) of those that are in
Authority, and do command in the Lord. 4. Peremptorium et infallibile, the
supreme judgment of the King of the Church, who cannot err. The first is
common to all, Romans 15. The second proper to Christians, and is a judgment of
faith, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 2. 1 Ioh. 4. 1. and it must be builded on the first. The
third is the Authoritative judgment of the Church, Act. 15. 28. Mat. 18. 17.
and of judges, and it must be swayed by the second, both in the commander and
the commanded. The fourth is Jesus Christ's only, Romans 14. 4. 1 Cor. 4. 5.

4. It is one thing, that the power of the Ministers be subject to the Not any
power or office subject to any, but to God immediately, subjection is properly
of persons.
Magistrate as the Magistrate, and another thing that the persons of the
Ministers should be subject: Not any office at all in their power, seems to me
to be subordinate to either Magistrate or Minister; because all Lawful power,
and Lawful and profitable offices, and Arts, in abstracto are from God, some
of them immediately; As the the gift of prophesying, healing, speaking with
tongues, working of miracles, and the offices of Apostle, Evangelist, Pastor,
and Teacher, Ephe. 4. 11. those be (...), gif^s and graces above Nature, that
God without the interveening of human reason, has devised for a supernatural
end, the edifying of his body the Church; men's will and reason may interveen in
the designation of persons to some of those offices, as that John, Thomas,
qualified as 1 Timothy 3. be Pastors, or teachers. But if we speak of the power of
the Ministry, in abstracto, without connotation of the persons in concerto,
then the power, or the office it self is not subordinate to the Ministers of
the Gospel as Ministers; far less to the Magistrate as the Magistrate, because
it depends upon none on earth, Minister or Magistrate; but the only good
pleasure of him, who when he ascended to heaven, gave gifts unto men, that
there is such an office as Minister, Pastor or teacher; And the Church cannot
create a new office of a Prelate; because of its nature it tends to a
supernatural end, the governing of Christ's body, in a way to life eternal,
purchased by Christ: Now the question in this sense, whether the power of the
Ministry be subordinate to the Magistrate in its constitution, it is alike in
its subordination to Magistrate and Minister; certain it is subordinate to
neither. Other lawful and profitable offices and Arts are from God, mediately,
possibly by the intervening acts of rational nature, though Magistracy be from
God, Romans 13. 1. yet it would seem, God by the natural reason of men, might
devise and constitute the very office of Magistracy in abstracto, and the Art
of sailing, painting, etc. yet is there no subjection of power to power here,
by way of dominion: Hence the question must be of the subordination of the
power, quoad exercitium, whether Ministers in the exercising of their
Ministerial calling be subordinate to the Magistrate as the Magistrate?

5. Did. A judge is one thing, and a just judge another thing, so here are we
to distinguish between a Magistrate, and a Christian Magistrate. As 1. a
husband is one thing, and a Christian husband another thing, a Captain is one
thing, and a Christian, and a believing Centurion or Captain, such as
Cornelius, Acts 10. is another; a Physician is one thing, and a gracious
Physician is another thing; sure a heathen Husband has the same jus Maritale,
the same Husband power in regard of Marriage union, that a Christian and
believing Husband has. 2. A Magistrate and a Christian Magistrate may be one
and the same Magistrate, with one and the same Magistraticall power, as being
first heathen Magistrate, as Sergius Paulus, Act. 13. 7, 12. and there after
converted to the faith. Paulus A Magistrate and a Christian different.
was no less a civil Deputy, when Heathen then when Christian, and not more
a Deputy as touching the essence of a Magistrate, when a Christian believer,
then he was before when a Heathen; yet to be a Magistrate, and to be a
believing Magistrate, are two different things, even as Christianity is a noble
ornament, and a gracious accident, and to be a Magistrate, is as it were the
Subject, even as a man, and the accidents of the man, are two different things.

6. There be two things here considerable in the Magistrates office. 1. There
is his jus and (...) Magistraticall power, or the authority Two things in a
Christian Magistrate, jus authority, aptitudo, ability.
official, the power of office to bear the sword. 2. There is aptitudo,
(...), a special heavenly grace of well governing; this is (...) a gift or
grace of God, to use that power for Christ. These two make one Christian
husband, one Christian captain, Physician, Master, in relation to to the wife,
soldiers, sick, servants: Now the Magistrate heathen as Magistrate, even Nero,
when the Church of God is in his court and dominions, has the same jus, the
same Authority and Official power, to be a keeper of both Tables of the Law,
and to defend the Gospel, and to command the Preachers and Synods to fulfill
their charge, and to see that the officers do their duty, and to punish dumb
dogs, Idolaters, excommunicated persons, to drive away with the sword false
Teachers from the flock, he has I say the same Magistraticall power, while he
is a Heathen, and when he is converted to the Christian faith, and he is
equally head of men that profess Christ, when Heathenish as when Christian;
but in neither States, is he the Head of the body the Church, and you give not
to Caesar the things that are Cesars, if you make converted Nero, because a
Magistrate, now the head of the Church, and deny non-converted and heathenish
Nero to be the Head of the Church; for he is a Magistrate with complete power
of the Sword, in the one case, as in the other, that he neither does, nor can
use the sword for the Church, it is from Nero his state of infidelity that he
is in as a man, and not the fault of his office, for when Paul says, the
Husband is the head of the Wife; does he mean a Christian husband only, and
exclude all heathen Husbands? No, for then the wife were not to be subject to
the Husband, if a Heathen and an unbeleever, which is against Paul's mind, 1
Cor. 7. and the Law of Nature. But the converted Magistrate, who was before a
heathen Magistrate, has a new aptitude, facul^y and grace to keep both Tables
of the Law, and to govern in a civil way, and indirectly the affairs of
Christ's Kingdom: Hence the adversaries clearly contradict themselves by
confounding those two, a Magistrate and a Christian Magistrate, one while they
give supreme power over the Church to the Magistrate as the Magistrate,
sometime to the Magistrate as Christian. So Vtenbogard in his book De officio,
and authoritate supremi Magistratus Christiani in rebus Ecclesiasticis p. 7.
and p. 8. hoc addo, ut intelligatur Magistratum, cum religione^ Christianam
amplectitur, non acquirere novam authoritatem, sed quod eam authoritatem, quam
ante etiam in rebus religi^nis and ^ultus divini, habebat authoritate^, --
recte utitur: If the Magistrate when he becomes a Christian, acquireth no new
authority as a Magistrate, but only uses well his old Authority, in matters
of Religion and of Gods worship, which he had before, while he was Heathen, as
he says, then the Heathen Magistrate as a Magistrate has a supreme power in
Church matters, and yet in the same place he draws the state of the question
to a Christian Magistrate. De solo Christiano Magistratu acturus. The Arminians
in their Apology, fol. 297. (as says their Declaration) speak only of the
Christian Magistrate, and yet page 298. potestati enim supremae, sive
Architectonicae, qua potestas suprema est, jus hoc ut competat, ratio ordinis,
sive boni Regiminis, natura sua postulat, -- si Magistratui qua tali jus hoo
competit, ^rgo multo magis competit Magistratui Christiano. Sure, if the
Magistrate, in general* and as the Magistrate, have a supreme Authority in the
Government of the Church, such as the Adversaries contend for, then the
Christian Magistrate far more must be Head of the Church, and so the
Magistrate as the Magistrate must be supreme Governor, and judge in all
Ecclesiastical causes, and in these same causes, he must not be Judge as a
Magistrate, but as a Christian.

Nor can they make a Christian Magistrate, a medium per participationem
utriusque extremi, a middle between a Magistrate and a Christian. 1. For where
is there such an office in either Church or state? for so a Christian
Magistrate as a Christian Magistrate should be Ens per aggregationem, a thing
composed of Magistracy and Christianity, as a Christian Physician, a Christian
Painter; and then the question should be, whether judges he as a Magistrate,
or as a Christian? as we may ask whether a Christian painter painteth as a
painter or as a Christian: not as a Christian, Pare^^ Com. in Romans 13. dub.
Iac. Triglandius de potest civ. and Ecclesiastica c. 10. 207, 208. Vbi nam
inju^xit Christus Magistratui Christiano ut oves Christi quae ^ales Regat.
for then all Christians should be Painters; and a result of both should
neither be a Magistrate nor a Christian, but middle between both, which
fights with reason and sense. Some say, The power of the Magistrate in a
Christian Magistrate who knows the doctrine of the Gospel, and has help of
the counsel and light of godly Pastors and Teachers, is perfecter then in
Heathen Magistrates, and therefore this power as not Christian or heathenish,
governs men as men, but as Christian, it governs them as Christian m^n. But
the learned and worthy professor Jac. Triglandius says this is said without
probation, for (says he) men as Christians are members of the Church, and so
are not governed but in an Ecclesiastical way* and where has the Lord
commanded the Christian Magistrate to govern the sheep of Christ, as the sheep
of Christ? Then (say I) 1. The magistrate must govern the Church as the
Church, and so rule over the conscience of men in relation to eternal
happiness, by promising to them temporal rewards, and by compelling them by
the sword, to be carried toward eternal beatitude; for to rule the Church as
the Church, is to direct and lead them by spiritual means, Word, Sacraments
and Discipline, to heaven, which the magistrate as a magistrate cannot do by
the sword; and what he does as a Christian* that he must do in a spiritual
way, not with a secular Christianity makes no new power of, or to Magistrates.
arm and power as magistrate; and the two powers of a magistrate and of a
Christian, cannot coalescere, grow together in one office which is made up of
both, as of two parts, being in nature and spece different, no more then of a
Horse and a Lion you can make a third living creature. It is true, by Grace and
Christianity, the power of the magistrate is perfected, and an excellent luster
added to it, but not one degree of Magistraticall power is added to it, by
which the magistrate does rule men as Christians, and as a Church: For as the
office of a magistrate does not promote the man one step nearer to saving
Grace; so Christianity makes not the Heathen magistrate more a magistrate, nor
gives him a new sword over the Church as the Church, which he had not before;
nor does it take any magistraticall power from him, no more then a heathen
Husband, Master, Physician, being converted to Christ, is more a husband, more
Jac. Trig. land. di^^er. Theo. de potest. civ. c. 8. p. 174. A fourfold
consideration of the exercise of Ministerial power most necessary, upon which
and the former Distinctions, follows ten very considerable Assertions.
a master or Physician, then he was before: The former power is only
spiritualized, and graciously facilitated in its acts, but not one whit
augmented in its entitative degrees of power over the wife, the soldiers, the
servants, the sick. Triglandius excellently: The Christian magistrate
converted, is sanctified, but he acq^ireth no new right over the Church: So
meat is sanctified by the Word and Prayer, but it is not more meat, nor does
more nourish, because sanctified.

7. Distinct. The exercise of the Ministerial power in dispensing Word,
Sacraments, Discipline, falls under a fourfold consideration, which, because
it clears a necessary point, I desire may be carefully observed by the
Reader: 1. The simple exercise of that power is considered sine modo, without
any qualification, good or evil, Orthodox, or Heterodox, as the Christian
Magistrate procures by his care, that there should be a Ministry to dispense
Word, Sacraments, and Disciplin^* 2. The second Consideration of this exercise,
is, The exercise of power soundly and painfully, in the fear of the Lord, the
Magistrate exhorting them thereunto for conscience. 3. The third Consideration
is the exercise of the same, in a corrupt and wicked way and manner, either
negligently or wickedly, or for evil ends. 4. The fourth Consideration is the
free and peaceable exercise of this power without bodily violence.

Hence I entreat the Reader to carry along in his ^ye, 1. The simple exercise
of the Ministerial power. 2. The just and godly, sound and laudable exercise.
3. The wicked and corrupt exercise, or the abuse thereof. 4. The peaceable
exercise.

Hence, our 1. Assertion: The Magistrate as the Magistrate is to 1. Assert.
procure that there be Preachers and Church Officers to dispense Word,
Sacraments, and Discipline: For 1. his end is, That people under him may lead a
quiet and a peaceable life in godliness and honesty, 1 Timothy 2. 2. And the
Magistrate attaineth his end as a Magistrate, if there be simple exercise of
Religion in the quiet and peaceable way, that may consist with the subjects
indemnity, and immunity, from rapine, injuries, and violence. 2. The
difference between the Magistrates and other callings, is, that the Magistrate
was to take care of old, That there were Levites who bare the Ark, and, Priests
who should burn incense before the Lord, and Sacrifice; and yet it was
unlawful for the Magistrate to bear the Ark on his own shoulders, or in his
own person to burn incense or sacrifice; so the Physicians hinder that diseases
rage amongst the subjects, and the Magistrates do also hinder that they should
rage: But the Physians hinder them by curing diseases, and the Magistrate
hinders them not by curing diseases; for then he should as a Magistrate also be
a Physician, but by procuring that there should be Physicians in the
Commonwealth. The Magistrate hinders ignorance, and losing Ships by Tempests,
not by professing and teaching Sciences and Arts in Academies in his own
person, nor by steering Ships, and guiding them himself to their Ports, for so
a magistrate as a magistrate should be a Schoolm^ster, a professor of Arts and
Sciences in the Universities, and a Pilot or Shipmaster, which were a
confounding of all callings; but by procuring that there should be Universities
and Professors of Arts and Sciences, and by providing honorable stipends and
wages for them, and procuring that in the Commonwealth there should be Sailers
who are skilled in Shipping: and so does the magistrate by his office take
care, that the Word, Sacraments and Discipline, be dispensed. 3. But the
magistrate as the magistrate does no^ command sincere, hearty, zealous, and
affectionate dispensing of Word, Sacraments and Discipline: But only the
dispensing of those without the qualification of the spiritual, The Magistrate
as the Magistrate commands the exercise of Ministerial power, but not the
spiritual and sincere manner of the exercise.
or sincere exercise of the power; Because, 1. The Magistrate cannot command
that as a magistrate, which he cannot judge of, whether the thing commanded be
consonant to his command, or not: But the magistrate as the magistrate cannot
judge of the spirituallity, sincerity, zealousnesse, affectionatenesse of that
obedience, which the Church yields to his command: for if the Pastors
dispense word and Sacraments, and bind and loose by the keys following the
rules of the word, the magistrate cannot judge the heart or intention, whether
they do those with conscience to God, and reverence and subjection of spirit to
his holy Law, nor can the manner of doing be proved by witnesses to the
magistrate. 2. The Magistrate as Magistrate does not command what he does not
praise or reward, for well doing is the object of the Magistrates praising and
rewarding power, Romans 13. 3. But as a Magistrate he does not praise and reward
the qualification, or spirituality, or sincerity of Pastors dispensing of word
and seals; if they feed the flock, the Magistrate is to take care they be
rewarded with wages, no^ can the Magistrate as the magistrate withhold praise
or wages from laborers in the vineyard, because they preach Christ out of
envy, as some did Phil. 1. 15. or because they feed not the lambs out of a love
to Christ, as they ought to do, Ioh. 21. 15, 16, 17. it is true, magistrates as
godly men, may love and commend sincerity in faithful laborers, and hate the
contrary; but this they do as Christian men, not as magistrates, not by their
office, and authoritatively. 3. Magistrates command that as magistrates, the
not doing of which they can a^ magistrates punish with the sword, for the
object of their vindicative and revenging power is ill doing, Romans 13. 4. But
if Pastors feed the flock and rule them, the magistrate cannot use the sword
against the feeders, for that they want sincerity, love, cheerfulness in the
manner of doing these things, for the sword of the magistrate does only reach
men for their external facts, not for opinions in the mind, not for crooked
intentions, not for hollow-heartednesse, hypocrisy, infidelity in the manner,
or inward principles of the actions.

II. Asser. when magistrates command Churchmen to do their duty, and to feed
the flock, sincerely, and in the fear of the Lord, they do it not as
magistrates; but as touching the manner, they may Magistrates as godly men, not
as Magistrates command sincerity and zeal in the manner of the exercise of
ministerial power.
exhort them to do their duty sincerely, cordially, and zealously as godly men;
hence that charge that King Iehoshaphat gave to the Priests and Levites, 2 Chronicles. 19. 9. This shall ye do in the fear of the Lord faithfully, and with a
perfect heart, is a mixed command, as touching the judging of the people in all
causes and controversies that should come before them; the King as King
commanded them to do this: But for the manner of the doing of it, that they
should do it faithfully in the fear of the Lord, and with a perfect heart;
this he commanded them not as a King, but exhorted them to it, as a godly and
religious man: for 1. any godly man might have said this, and the King might
have punished the Levites and Priests, if they had not judged the causes
according to the Law. But though they had not judged in the fear of the Lord,
and with a perfect heart; yet could not the King as King have punished them
therefore, nor can any say, that the spiritual exhortation of Hezekiah, 2 Chronicles. 29. to the Priests and Levites, came from him as King, but as from a
graced and religious man; as King he might command them to Sanctify themselves
legally, for so they were to do by office; and he might use the sword against
them, if they failed in that; and as King he may command all external duties,
not only to Churchmen, but to all others; only he cannot punish them for
failings in the spiritual manner of doing external duties* 2* A spiritual
and Christian exhortation ex condition operis, and intrinsecally, has
influence on the conscience to turn the soul to God. But nothing that the
magistrate can do as a magistrate, has such an influence on the conscience,
all that he does as a magistrate and directly, is toward the outward man, by
rewards and punishments; if the magistrate remove false teachers and wolves,
which would devour the flock, and if that work upon the conscience, it is
indirectly and by accident, for, quoad actus imperatos, he can command that the
Gospel, which has a kindly and intrinsecall power to work upon the conscience,
be preached; if the magistrate convince the conscience of a murderer, that he
has failed against the Law of God, he does not that as a magistrate, but as a
godly and religious man* he may convince him as a magistrate, that he has
failed against the Laws of the State, and bands of humane society, and
external peace, and scarce that, for ignorantia juris nemime^^ excusat.

Obj. 1. It may be objected against this: If the Elders not only omit to do
their duty, but also if they err in the nature and quality of what they do,
the Magistrate is to punish; Ergo, the Magistrate not only commands the
Church to do the external facts* but also commands the facts with such and
such qualities: the Antecedent is proved because the Magistrate not only
punishes the omission of a Church duty, as if Pastors preach not; but also if
they preach not ^al^ modo, Orthodox and sound Doctrine.

Ans. We never denied but the Magistrate commands both the exercise of Church
power simply, and the man^er and such qualifications as are external and
obvious to the knowledge of the Magistrate, such as blasphemous and false
Doctrine is; But we deny that as a Magistrate he does command those things that
ar^ internal and invisible, that is, the spirituallity of the actions; he can
exhort and stir men up to the spirituallity and sincerity of doing as a godly
and Christian man.

Obj. 2. The Pastors and guides of the Church as such, do only command
external obedience, for they can only in ^oro Ecclesiae, in the Court of the
Church censure external disobedience before men, the heart and sincerity
thereof is no more obvious to the eye of Elders, then of Magistrates.

Ans. 1. I deny the connection of the Antecedent; for Elders may command as
Elders, more then the not doing of which they can censure, which the Magistrate
cannot do; for Elders have committed to them the word of reconciliation, as the
Ambassadors of Christ. Now the word has an immediate influence on the
conscience, on the thoughts and intents of the heart, 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19, 20. 1
Cor. 3. 5. 1 Cor. 4. 15. Ps. 19. 7. Heb. 4. 12, 13. And therefore their
Ministry has action on the thoughts; yet can they not in the external court
of the Church, censure the thoughts, as not being able to see them, but the
Gospel which they preach can arraigne the conscience and thoughts* 2 Cor. 10.
4, 5. But the Magistrate carries not such a message, and therefore his
Magistraticall command can reach no farther then his temporal praise and
reward, and his sword; and that is commensurable and of equal latitude with
those.

Obj. 3. The Object of the Magistrates power, is well doing, and ill doing,
both civil, and also supernatural; both for the first table, or as well for
the spiritual acts of worship and Religion in the first table, as for acts of
Justice and mercy in the second table, Romans 13. 3, 4. Isai. 49, 23. and you
said elsewhere, that external peace is too narrow an object for the
Magistrate, for the intrinsecall end of a Magistrate is also a supernatural
good, and not only a peaceable, but also a godly life, 1 Timothy 2. 2.

Ans. It is true, the Magistrate as the Magistrate does care for the
supernatural good of subjects, and the duties of Religion, and the first
table, but how? intrinsecally and as a magistrate, that is, that men worship
God according to his word: But, 1. The magistrate as such has nothing to do
with the spirit, nor can he command the sincerity of the worship; his care is
that there be a divine worship, that is, materially and externally right and
consonant, externally to the rules of the word; and for this cause learned
divines make the external man the object of the magistrates office; but not
the external man as doing the duties of the second table only, but also as
serving God in the duties of the first table: for which cause Augustine. contr.
literas petilian. l. 2. c. 92. and contr. Cresconi. l. 8. c. 5. reges serviunt
D^o in quantum sunt homines, and in quantum sunt reges.
I said Augustine meant the same, when he said, that Kings serve God as men and
as Kings. 2. Magistrates as magistrates are to extend their power for Christ;
that is, that not only there be Justice and Peace amongst men, but also that
there be Religion in the land, yea, that the Gospel be preached; so all our
Divines make the King to be custos ^t vindex utriusque tabule: Yea, I think he
is a keeper and preserver of the Gospel also, and is to command men to serve
Christ, and profess the Gospel, and to punish the blaspheming of Jesus Christ:
and this is royal and magistraticall service that the King as King performs
to God, and to Jesus Christ the mediator, ex condition operis, in regard that
good which he procures as King, materially and externally, is consonant to the
supernatural Law of the Gospel, but it is not magistraticall service to Christ
ex intention operantis.

Obj. 4. When its required that the Magistrates be men fearing Exo. 18. 21 Deu.
1. 16. 17. D^u. 17. 19 20.
God, hating coveteousnesse, etc. is not this an essential ingredient of an
King as a King, that he read in the book of the Law, that he may fear God,
Deuteronomy. 17?

Ans. There is a twofold goodness here to be considered, one of the magistrate
as a magistrate, another as a good and Christian magistrate. The former is an
official goodness, or a magistraticall prudence, justice, and goodness; this
is required of all magistrates as such, to judge the people: so the acts of an
heathen magistrate done according to common natural equity, by Nebuchadnezzar,
Pilate, Caesar, Felix, Festus, are to be acknowledged as acts of a Lawful
Magistrate, valide and no less essentially Magistraticall, then if performed
by King David; and of this goodness the Scriptures speak not as essential to
a Magistrate as a Magistrate: But there is another goodness required of
Magistrates as A two fold good in a Christian Magistrate, essential,
accidental.
they are Members of the Jewish Church, and as they are Christians, and of
these the Scripture speaks; and so Magistrates not as Magistrates, but as
good and Christian, are to be such as fear God, hate covetousness, respect
not the face and favor of men; so its denied that the fear of God, hating of
covteousnesse, are essential ingredients of Kings as Kings: For Kings as Kings
intend justice, peace, godliness, materially considered, both ex condition
operis, and operantium. But for justice and righteous judgment in a spiritual
and an Evangelick way, that belongs not to the essence of a Magistrate nec ex
condition seu ex intention operis, nec ex condition operantis: The Holy
Ghost requires it of judges, as they would approve themselves as truly Holy
and Religious, and would be accepted of God, and in this sense Kings as Kings
do not serve God, nor the mediator Christ, nor yet as men; only they serve God
and the mediator Christ as Christian Kings, or as Christian men rather.

III. According to that third member of our seventh Distinction; Asser. 3.
The unjust and evil exercise of the Ministerial power, is obnoxious to the
magistrate as the magistrate, thus, in that he bears the sword against all
evil doers, To. 13. 1. The magistrate as the magistrate does only command well
doing, in order to praise and a good name, or temporal reward amongst men,
Romans 13. 3. Do that which is good and thou shall have praise of the power, 1 Timothy 5. 17. Matthew. 10. 10. Nor can the magistrate as the magistrate promise, or
command the Elders to feed the Flock, with the promise of the reward that Peter
promises, 1 Pet. 5. 4. to wit, That when the chief shepherd shall appear;
they shall receive a Crown of glory that fades not away. The magistrate as a
Preacher (if he be one, as David and Solomon were both) or as a godly religious
Christian man, may hold forth such a promise, but not as a Magistrate, and upon
the same ground the Magistrate as the Magistrate cannot forbid careless, unsound
preaching, and rigorous and tyrannical ruling or rather domineering over the
Flock, under the pain of death eternal: for he can but kill the body, and has
but the carnal and temporal sword, Romans 13. 4. and so he can inhibite ill
doing only in order to temporary punishment, and though the duty of the former
be spiritual, and the sin of the latter also, yet the external man is
capable only of the Magistrates promises and threatenings, as they respect evil
or good temporary; so that it is a wonder to me, that M. Pryn or any learned
man can say that magistrates can make Laws to bind the conscience, sure it is
ill divinity. 2. If there never had been sin, there should have been no The
Magistrate as such commands only in order to temporary reward, and punishes,
and lays no commands on the constience.
government but of Fathers and Husbands, there should have been no
magistraticall dominion, not any magistraticall allurement to weldoing by
temporal rewards, not any terrifying from evil doing, from fear of the sword,
death, stripes, or bands, and God governed the Apostolic Church, and they
attained the Crown and supernatural end of life eternal, without the
accessory hire of a a temporary reward from the magistrate, and the subsidy of
his sword; Ergo, it is evident that the magistrate is neither an essential,
nor an integrall part of the visible Church as the visible Church, enjoying all
the Ordinances of God, Word, Sacraments, Discipline, Censures, Rebukes,
Admonition, Excommunication, Prayers, Mutual edification, in as great
perfection, as is happily attainable in this life without, yea, against the
will of the civil magistrate: Though it be a great encouragement to have the
King a Nurse-father; yet has not Christ counted it simply necessary to his
visible Church enjoying all the Ordinances of God to the full. 3. If the
magistrate do only command the teachers and Pastors to preach and determine
synodically, in order to a temporal reward, and forbid them to abuse their
ministerial power in order to temporary punishment, by the temporary sword;
then surely the Pastors and Teachers are not subjected to them in conscience,
after any Ecclesiastical way, for the power of commanding in magistrates as
magistrates must be commensurable to the power of punishing the transgressors
of the command; if the one be in order to a temporary good, the other cannot
but be in order to an eternal ill; if ministers command in the name of Christ,
in order to an eternal reward, they cannot threaten the transgressors in order
to a temporary punishment, but it must be in order to an eternal punishment:
Nota.
so that it is most clear, that the magistrate though he be in some sense a
little God, and invested with the authority and Majesty of God, in that he
commands and threatens upon proposal of temporary reward, and temporary
good, the very same duties that God injoyneth, and forbids the same evils
of sin that God forbids; yet he holds not these out to the soul and
conscience of the subjects, as the Ambassador of Jesus Christ, upon condition
of eternal life, if they obey, and of eternal death, if they disobey; but he
holds out to the external man these that are materially divine commandments
and divine inhibitions, but in another consideration* but formally only they
are the mandates of the Magistrates in order to temporary reward and temporary
punishment. Then the Ministers as Ministers in preaching and Synods, forbid
adultery, incest, murder; but they propose them to those that are within the
visible Church; And that, 1. to their consciences, 2. Under the pain of
eternal wrath. 3. As the Ambassadors of Christ craving spiritual subjection
of conscience, and divine faith to those charges: But Magistrates as
Magistrates hold forth in their Law-abstinence from those same sins of
adultery, incest, murder; But, 1. Not to the Nota. Magistrates as Magistrates
forbid not sin as sin under the pain of eternal wrath.
consciences of their subjects, but to the outer man as Members of the
commonwealth. 2. Not under the pain of eternal wrath and condemnation,
before the judge of quick and dead: Magistrates as Magistrates have neither
calling, office, place nor power to threaten or inflict eternal punishment; if
Magistrates do persuade the equity of abstinence from adultery, incest,
murder, in their Statutes, or Acts of Parliament, from the word of God, from
the sixth and seventh command of the Decalogue, from the judgment and eternal
punishment that follows these sins, they so persuade not as Magistrates,
but as Divines, and as godly and Christian men; yet my sense is not that the
Magistrate can Lawfully command obedience in matters of Religion not understood
or known by the subjects, that were to exact blind obedience; but my meaning
is, that the Magistrate as the Magistrate holds not forth his commandments
to teach and inform the conscience, as Pastors do, but he presupposes that
his mandates are known to be agreeable to the word of God, and proposes them
to the subjects to be obeyed. 3. Magistrates as Magistrates hold forth in their
Law, abstinence from these sins, not as the Ambassadors of Christ, craving
subjection of conscience and divine faith to those charges, but only external
obedience: for though Ministers as Ministers crave faith and subjection of
conscience to all commandments and inhibitions, as in Christ's stead, 2 Co. 5.
19 20. yet the Magistrate as the Magistrate does not crave either faith or
subjection of conscience, nor is he in Christ's stead, to lay divine bands on
the conscience, to submit the soul and conscience to believe and abstain, he
is the dep^^y of God as the God of Order, and as the Creator, and founder, and
another of humane societies, and of Peace, to exact external obedience, and to
lay bands on your hands, not to shed innoceat blood, and on your body not to
defile it with adultery, or incest, nor to violate the ch^st^^y of your
brother; hence it is evident, that the adversaries are far our* who would have
Ministers who do hold forth commands, that lays hold on the conscience and
craveth faith and soul-submission under the pain of eternal wrath, to do and
act as the deputies and Vicars of those who have nothing to do with the
conscience, and have neither office nor authority to crave soul submission, or
to threaten or inflict any punishment, but such as is circum^cribed within the
limits of time, and which the body of clay is capable of; yea, when the
Magistrate punishes spiritual sins, heresy, idolatry, he punishes them
only with temporary punishment.

Obj. 5. When a Minister speaks that which is treason against the Prince in
the Pulpit, by way of Doctrine, the Church only does take on them to judge him,
and censure him, and he will not answer the civil judge for his Doctrine, but
decline him, and appeal to a Synod; and yet if another man in private speak
these same words of treason, he is judged by the civil judge, and can give no
de^linature against this civil judicature, this must be unequal dealing,
except the civil judge may by his office, judge whether the Minister spoke
treason or not.

Ans. It cannot be denied, but that which is spoken by way of Doctrine by an
Ambassador, speaking the word in public, and that which is spoken in private,
although the ^ame words, are very different: for a private man in private to
slander the Prince may be treason, he has no place, nor calling to speak of
the Prince, but a Pastor has a calling as the watchman of the Lord of hosts to
rebuke* Herod for incest, and in a constitute Church, the Church is to try
whether John Baptist preached treason or not. 2. If it be a slander of the
Prince and treason indeed, the Prophet who preached it, is first subject to the
Prophets, who are to condemn and censure him, and then the magistrate is to
inflict bodily punishment on him for it; but the Church should labor to gain
the slanderers soul, before the civil judge take away his life.

IV. Assert. The Magistrate de jure is obliged not only to permit, but also to
procure the free exercise of the ministry in dispensing Word, Sacraments, and
Discipline, and owe his accumulative power, to convene Synods, to add his
sanction to the lawful and necessary constitutions and ordination of worthy,
and to the Deposition of unworthy officers in the Church. 1. Because he is a
Nurse-father in the Church, Isa. 49 23. 2. And by office, as a Public father,
to procure the good of the souls of the subjects in his coactive way, that we
may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty, 1 Timothy 2. 2.
3. He is not only to permit, but also positively to procure all peace, in the
exercise of all lawful and profitable trades and Arts; Ergo, far more that
glory may dwell in the Land, and that the Peace thereof may be as a River, Isa.
48. 18. by the presence of Christ walking in the midst of the Golden
Candlesticks.

V. Assertion. When the Magistrate commands painful and sound administration
in preaching and governing, with provision of the praising and rewarding of
well doing, he does not subordinate to himself the Ministry in its exercise.
1. Because this promise is accumulative, and of a temporal reward, for the
Magistrate as the Magistrate cannot promise that which Peter promises; that 1.
1* Pet. 5. 4. When the chief shepherd shall appear, they shall receive a
crown of glory that fades not away, he may as a Christian promise that, but
for a temporal reward for men, no man for being faithful in the house of God,
has that unseparably annexed to his labors, by a literal promise in
Scripture, and therefore it is only accumulative. 2. Right and sound preaching
and governing in Gods house, cannot from this be said to be subjected to the
Magistrate as a Magistrate, in regard that this is an accidental hire, and an
external and accessorie good, which the Church as the Church, and the most
faithful Prophets, Apostles, and Pastors have wanted, and yet have attained
the end of a Church as a Church visible, nor is this a promise made to the
Church as the Church or the Ministers thereof as such, for the Apostolic
church that was most poor, had neither thing, nor name, nor promise, but by the
contrary, the Kings and Rulers did conspire against the Kingdom of the son of
God.

VI. Assertion. Though the Magistrate may both threaten to inflict, and
actually inflict the ill of temporal punishment on Ministers, if they be
either idle or unsound in their administration; yet thence can only be
concluded that the male administration of the ministry is subjected to the
Magistrate as such, but not the Ministry it self, or the exercise thereof. 1.
The male administration of any office is accidental to the office. 2. This
subjecteth the erring person, not the teaching Minister to the civil
Magistrate. Nor does this make the Ministers in the exercise of their office,
properly subordinate to the Ministers, but only so far as the spirits of the
Prophets are subject to the Prophets.

VII. Assertion. There is a twofold subordination of the exercise of Male
administration of Ministers; one civil, another Ecclesiastical: These two
differ, so as the former must be subordinate to the Magistrate who is to
inflict bodily punishment, but the latter is only subject to the Church. The
Judicial determination according Two sorts of subordinations Civil,
Ecclesiastic.
to the Word of God, for the informing of the conscience and gaining to the
truth the erring Ministers, is proper to the College of Ministers; and in this
if the college of Ministers err, they are also punishable, and the Magistrate
is to command them to judge and determine, de novo, over again: The Magistrate
in a constitute church is to determine civilly, and sentence, and civilly
punish the Ministers that either are dumb dogs, and will not bark, or that
perverts the souls of people with false doctrine, and where the Church is
constituted, it is presumed that the Priests, whose lips should preserve
knowledge, have determined in an Ecclesiastical way, the very same which the
Judge civilly is to determine, not because Ministers not the Ambassadors of an
earthly King, but of the King of Kings.
the Church has so determined, but because he judges in his conscience it to
be according to the Word of God.

VIII. Assertion. The Ministers are in no sort the Ambassadors or servants of
the Magistrate, but of Jesus Christ, and immediately in their ministerial acts
subordinate to the King of Kings. 1. They declare the truth in the Name of
Christ, their master and Lord, not in the name of the Magistrate, as the
Arminians make the steps of the subordination. 1. The Word of God. 2. The
Magistrate carrying Gods sword. 3. The Preachers of the Gospel; for then the
Preachers should hear the word of the Magistrate first, and have the mind of
Christ spoken and revealed to them immediately from the magistrate, but
mediately only by the mediation of the Magistrate, the mind of Christ. 2.
There should be in every Christian Kingdom, where there is a King, a civil
Pope, having directly both the Swords, not with the distinction of Jesuits, of
dixectly and directly, and as they say, the Pope has the temporal sword,
indirectly and in ordine ad spiritualia, in order to spiritual things, and and
how many inferior Magistrates, so many civil Popes, only they shall not be
infallible. Arminians say that this collection is from envy, Because we (say
they) deny a headship and supremacy of power of Government, to your Pastors
and Elders in all your Parishes, which makes the Church a Monster with many
heads; therefore you put this, for envy upon the Magistrate, who yet has the
word of God above him, which the Pope has not, who sets himself above the
Word of God.

Ans. 1. If we give a supremacy royal, and princely to the Ministers, which
they call Archi^ectonica, as the adversaries do to the Magistrate; multitudes
of Popes behoved to be in the Church; but we make them mere Heralds,
Trumpeters, and Messengers to relate the will of God, void of all royal power,
and having neither earthly majesty, power, nor Sword. 2. It is not our
Argument, that in which they conceive we repose, to wit, that we think the
adversaries resolve all ultimate, and last which concerns the government of
the Church, in the will of the Magistrate, as on an infallible rule, we grant
they teach that the Word of God is to rule the Magistrate in the matters of the
first Table, and justice and equity in the things of the second Table, but they
say this in words only, but the Magistrate as Magistrate may mould Church
Officers as such not subordinate to the Magistrate.
out of his high dominion what Church government he will, and this by
consequent resolves all in the Magistrates will; and that they teach, that
when the Magistrate does command against the Word of God, then it is better to
obey God then men. And 2. This we infer as an absurdity that they cannot shun
that there is such a new officer, a new Church head, a creature most like a
Pope in every Christian Kingdom brought in the Church, who is above Bishops,
Pastors, Doctors, who by office must carry the mind of God to Pastor and
people, who has the keys of the House to make and unmake, call and send,
recall and exantorate ministers as his Servants and Heralds. 3. Look what
power the Magistrate as a Magistrate has in civil affairs, the same has he
in dispensing Word, Sacraments, admitting to, or rejecting from the Sacraments,
calling of ministers, excommunicating by this way, and so by office, he is no
less essentially a Pastor to watch for the soul, then he is a civil Judge.
4. How does this confound the two Kingdoms? the Kingdom that is of this
world, and fights with the Sword; and the Kingdom that is not of this world,
and fights not with the Sword? if the magistrate as the magistrate and armed
with the sword, be the supreme Head over both, and as he bears the Sword have
a carnal dominion over the Church as the Church? 5. If God have made the
subordination of ministers as ministers, and servants of the magistrate as a
magistrate, then the visible Church has no ordinary right, to Ordinances,
Word, Sacraments, discipline, but by the magistrate; and all that the Churches
did in the Apostles times, or the first three hundred years after Christ, being
contrary to the magistrates will, must be either seditious, or then it was by
no rule of the Gospel, but by an extraordinary dispensation; and we shall have
no warrant for any dispensing of the Word, and of Seals, or Government from the
Apostolic Church, because all that must have been beside the rule and
extraordinary. 6. From this pretended subordination, as the supreme magistrate
may do all that the inferior magistrate may do, because the King is
eminently all that the inferior Magistrate is, and something more; so may he
dispense the Word and Sacraments, in regard that the King is by the same
official power over the Church as the Church, in sacris, in all matters of
Religion, as in civil things, and contains in him, in a high and eminent
manner, all that the Church and Pastors can do, as they are such, and because
the King has the same power, in all Arts and Trades, then by his Royal power
he might (if he had time and leisure) build houses, because of his royal
Eminency over all Trades, he might sit at the helm of any ship, and steer and
rule it, he might paint Images, he might plow the ground, because he has the
like Royal power over masons, Sailors, Painters, Husbandmen, carpenters, and
the like, as he has over the commonwealth, and the Church; we must then say
that God has called the King to all these to be a minister, a mason, a Sailor,
a Painter, and if he had leisure, he has Gods calling to be a Preacher, a
Sailor, as to be a King, yea, and that as King he is all these: Now the Apostle
clearly distinguishes between him who exhorts and teaches in the Church,
Romans 12. and him who is the Minister of God, and bears not the sword in
vain, Romans 13. and clearly insinuates a distinction of calling, so that God
never called one man to all callings, as it is 1 Cor. 7. 17. But as God has
distributed to every man, as the Lord has called every one, so let him walk,
ver. 20. Let every one abide in the same calling wherein he was called: And it
is clear, if the King be a Head in the body* 1 Cor. 12. then he is not the
feet, though he have need of the feet, for then the eye should be both eye and
ear, and hand, and therefore the King cannot be all. Pareus in Romans 13. says,
the King cannot do some things ob defectum juris ex Dei limitatione, He cannot
preach. Ans. Ergo, Preaching belongs by Divine right to another, and its not
subordinate to him, jure Divino. 2. Says Pareus, he wants law to use the
wi^^ of another man as his own. Ans. Then the right of Husband and Wife is not
subordinate to the King, so as he may use the right of a Husband, because it is
against the seventh Commandment, nor can he invade the right of Pastors to
dispense Word and Sacraments, it being against the second Commandment, he not
being called thereunto. 3. Other things (says he) he cannot do for want of
skill, as to teach in a College, and others he cannot do, because they are
fordid, as to sew shoes. Ans. If God have not called the Prince to these, it
is not only sordid, but unlawful for him to thrust his sickle in another man's
field, for God must call to a lawful calling, else men use a lawful thing
unlawfully, so it is sordid and unlawful for him to judge those, and the like.
Erastus I know roundly grants that the King or any Magistrate may lawfully
dispense the Word and Sacraments, nothing hinders him, but want of time,
which is a better Answer then others give, who hold the same principles with
Erastus, and that the King has the same Royal power in things civil and
Ecclesiastic, except the adversary flee to our distinction of power and
persons, and of things civil and sacred, they shall never expede themselves.
But the King (say they) is See the Arminian Remonstrance in Apol. c. 25. fol.
299, 300. What power Erastiaus give to Magistrates in Church matters*
not capable of 1. The power of Order, he cannot be a Pastor, or a Doctor. 2.
He cannot as King be capable of internal power of jurisdiction, he cannot
preach, he cannot dispense the Sacraments, but he is (say they) capable of
external power of jurisdiction, to govern the Church, excommunicate, to
debar Apostates and Heretics from the Sacraments, to create Prelates,
Primates, Metropolitans, and such cattle, to call and ordain, make and unmake
Ministers, to make all Canons and Ecclesiastical Laws, and appoint religious
Ceremonies, as holy Surplice, crossing, oil and spittle in Baptism, to create
holy days, to command men to kneel to bread, and to order all the external
worship of God, and beside the Word, to order many little and smaller things in
the borders of worship external, such as is some little Idolatry, and
Superstition: And (for ought I know) by their way, who hold there is no
certain form of Government of Gods House in the Scripture, some harmless
and innocent golden The mind of Arminians touching the Magistrates power in
Church matters. Remonstrant Arminian c. 25. p. 304
Calves, as lawful as religious symbolicall Ceremonies. This power is no more
due to the Magistrate as the Magistrate, then to dispense the Sacraments, as I
have said before: Nor do the Arminians much honor the Magistrate, who walking
in the steps of Erastus do hold, that the Magistrate having power of public
places, Preachers are obliged not to preach in public places, if the
Magistrate forbid them, but they may preach in private places. But 1. These
same Arminians hold that Pastors are to preach whatever in their conscience
seems to be the truth of God; a principle of those who are for tolleration of
all Religions; though Iudaisme and Turcisme, a way (I am persuaded) most
abominable, and which the Lord of his Church will crush, when he shall bring
down other Antichristian untruths to the ground; Now it seems to the conscience
of Papists and many Heretical teachers, that they are obliged to preach
Turcisme, and Iudaisme in the Temple, and in public, and that distinction is
false and vain, as it is in very deed contrary to the truth of God, to preach
what they think the truth of God, and to preach it in public or private, or in
any place is indifferent as touching the place. 2. The Lord has no more given
to Magistrates power of places, or actions religious in places, then he has
given to them power of truths: Ergo, they must be obliged in conscience,
rejecting a ^^i^ and saplesse distinction, to preach in public places: for as
that juditio^s ^^c. Trig. de potest. (...). and Eccelesiastica diss^^tatio,
Th^^l. p. 123 T^m^lorum usus and s^ipe^^iorum publ^^orum ^^^ in re nihil
potest. ille enimextrins^^us accedit ad res Ecclesiasticas, eorumque naturam

relation to the Church
and learned professor Iac. Triglandius says, The place is accident all to the
worship, and changes not the nature of it; and truly as that learned professor
says, it is a poor honor that they put on the Magistrate, to limit all his
power to places and stipends. 3. The Apostles knew not this distinction, for
they not only preached truth, the Scribes and Pharisees forbidding them; but in
public places, and at all occasions, and daily in the Temple, and in every
house, they c^^sed not to teach and preach Jesus Christ, Act. 6. 2, 4. and 4.
1. 20. and 5. 20, 21. The Magistrate being Antichristian forbids not
preaching of saving truths, because of the place, be it private or public* but
he forbids them, because they are saving, and if Jesus Christ have called a
man to preach in public, in the house tops, the Magistrate has no power from
God to silence him in public more then in private; the Magistrate forbids
that any teach false Doctrine, not for the place, but because it is injurious
and hurtful to humane societies that men should be principled in a false
Religion, and cannot but disturb the public peace.

IX. Asser. The Christian magistrate must here come under a threefold
consideration. 1. As the Object of that high office is merely and purely
civil, and positive relating only to a civil end of Peace: as in importing,
or exporting of goods, of wool, wax, moneys for the good of the
commonwealth, the crying up or crying down of the value of coined Gold or
Silver, the making of Laws merely civil; as not to carry Armor in the night
in such a City: So in War, Commanders, Captains and Colonels are Magistrates
to order the Battle, lay stratagems, the way of besieging Towns, of fortifying
Castles, of issuing out mandates for the Navy; The Parliaments power in
disposing of Fouling, Fishing, Hunting, Eating of Flesh, or not eating at such
a time: all these* as the Word of God does not particularly warrant the one
side more then the other, are merely civil and positive* It is sure the
Magistrate has a supremacy, and an independency above the Church or Ministers
of the Gospel in all these; and as these prescinde from all Morality of the
first and second Table, I hold that neither the power nor person of the
Magistrate is subordinate to the Church and Church Assemblies, and Ministers of
the Gospel should (...) and exceed the limits and bounds of their calling, if
they should meddle with these; as the Church should exceed their bounds, if
they should make Canons touching the way of sailing, painting, tilling the
earth according to such and such principles of Art, for these are without the
sphere of the Churches activity; in this consideration that learned and grave
Divine Doctor Andrew Rivetus in Decalo in c. 5. says well, page 204. That as
we believe a man well skilled in his own Art, so that his judgment is a
supreme rule; so the supreme authority of the Magistrate to us in things
positive, is a rule; for indeed it cannot be denied but there be Arcana Imperi^
secrets of State that are not to be communicated to Pastors or to any, in which
the Rulers have a supremacy. The Magistrate falls under a second
consideration, as he gives out Laws just or unjust, and executes judgment
in the morning, or suffers the eyes of the poor, the widow and Orphane to
fail for went of justice; and in these he is not subject to the Church and
Pastors so, but only as if he sin in making Laws, the Pastors may humbly
supplicate that he would recall those unjust Laws, and judge over again
righteous judgment, and this exhorting of the Pastors is a subjecting of the
Magistrate to the Pastors quoad actus imperatos; so have General assemblies in
the Church of Scotland humbly supplicated the King and Parliament to retreat
Laws made against the liberties of the Church, in savor of Antichristian
Prelates and Ceremonies; but quoad actus elicitos: The Church and Pastors
themselves cannot usurp the throne, and give out civil Laws that are
righteous, and judge righteously: for the poor in the place of King, Parliament
and Judges; for in this also the judges are supreme and independent, and
subject only to God the Creator, as his Vicars and Deputies in Gods universal
Kingdom of power called universale regnum potentiae, by Divines; they are
Gods, and the shields of the world, and here only as they err, not as they
judge, are they subject to rebukes and threatenings, and admonitions of the
Church and Ministers of the Gospel: Even as the Magistrate may command the
Pastors to preach and dispense the Sacraments aright, but the Magistrate
himself can neither preach nor dispense the Sacraments: Course of conformity,
part 3. page 146.
so the Schoolmen say, that the actions of the understanding depend on the
will, quoad excercitium, the will may set the mind to think on this or that
truth; but not quoad specificationem. The will it self can neither assent, nor
dissent from a truth, nor can the will command the mind to assent to a known
untruth, or dissent from a known truth; the mind or understanding naturally
does both, and this distinction holds in acts of the civil power, and in
acts merely Ecclesiastical* The third consideration of the Christian
Magistrate is as he is a man, and a member of a Christian Church who has a
soul to be saved, and in this, he is to submit to Pastors, as those that watch
for his soul, Heb. 13. 17. as others who have souls to be saved.

X. Ass. Hence I am not afraid to assert a reciprocation of subordinations,
Reciprocation of subordina^^^ns between Church and Magistrate.
between the Church and the Magistrate, and a sort of collaterality and
independent supremacy in their own kind common to both, for every soul, Pastors
and others, are subject to the Magistrate as the higher power, in all civil
things, Romans 13. 1, 2, 3, 4. Tit. 3* 1. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. Mat. 22. 21. and all
members of the commonwealth, being members of the Church in soul-matters, are
subject to the Church and Pastors in their authoritative dispensing of Word,
Sacraments and Church censures: Nor are any Magistrates or other A^t. Walens,

written on this subject Teach: As the learned Walens, judicious Trig. that most
learned Divine, And. Rivetus; the grave and learned professors of Leyden,
Zipperus, Calv. Petr. Cabel Javi^^, reverend and pious M. John Cotton,
judicious P. Mar. D. Pareus, all the Protestant confessions. The Augustine
confession distinctly of Helvetia. The confession of Sweden, the Saxon. The
English confession and that of Scotland, all our Divines; while Erastus,
Vtenbogard, Hu. Grotius, Vedelius, (Bullinger, Gualth^rus, going before them;
yet not every way theirs) did teach the contrary. The Arminians in Holland did
thus flatter the Magistrate for their own politic ends, and some Court
Divines made the King of England Head of the Church, in the place of the Pope,
which P. Mar. excused and expounded benignly; some say it is against reason
that there should be two supreme collateral powers, and especially in a
mutual subordination. But can we deny this reciprocation of subordinations? it
is evident in many things; if the King be in an extreme fever, one of his own
subjects, a skilled Physician forbids him to drink wine, the King is to obey
him as a Physician, by virtue of the sixth command, as the King would not kill
himself: And yet by virtue of the fifth command, the Physician being the Kings
subject, is subject to the Laws of the King. The Queen of Scotland as a wife,
was to be subject to her Husband in the Lord, as the Word of God commands,
Ephesians. 5. 22. and her own Husband not being King, but a subject, was to obey
his Wife, the Princes and supreme Magistrate according to the Word of God, Romans
13. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. Tit. 3. 1. Yea, all Arts have a sort of collateral
and co-equall dignity, and we are to believe a skilled Artist in his own Art,
though this Artist be a servant, a vassal, a slave to those who do yield to him
in his own Art.

CHAP. XXV.
Quest. 21.
Objections touching the subordinations of Magistrate and Church removed.

THere is nothing more hated by the Adversaries then the pretended emulation of
those two superlatives and highest powers: Some Object, 1. Are not all powers
on earth subject to the Magistrate? Ministers of the Gospel not excepted; does
not the Magistrate command the Pastors to preach the Word?

Ans. All power deviating offensively, and to the disturbance of societies in
Morals, is subject to the Civil power and the Sword; and every power failing
against the Law and Gospel within the bosom of the Church, is subject to the
Word of God, in the mouth of the Ministers, who are nothing but Servants and
Heralds; so that the subjection is to God, not to the Church, and in a
spiritual and Ecclesiastical way: See P. Martyr. Lo. Com. l. 4. c. 13. and
seq; Its but a poor evasion of Vedelius, to say, That the Magistrate is subject
to the Church Catachrestice and abusive, unproperly and abusively. 1. Because
the Ministers as the Ambassadors of Christ do properly and not abusively preach
the Gospel to Magistrates. 2. Magistrates are not unproperly the sheep of
Christ; yea, they are to the adversaries chief Members of the Church; Ergo,
they are that way subject as other Members, as Pareus says, Com. Romans 13. Nor,
3. Will that prove any thing that the Pastors are Ministers, not Lords: for to
people and Prince as they have souls to be saved, they are Ministers, and by
this people should abusively be subject as well as Magistrates: But Vedelius
freeth Magistrates from subjection to Pastors; because they are subject to the
Word of God, not to Pastors, but so are the people subject also the same way.

Obj. 2. Then may the Church censure all sins, even those that are most
proper to the civil judge, such as sorcery, parricide, sodomie, for the which
the Magistrate is to draw the sword, and for which the Lord made the land to
cast out seven great Nations.

Ans. The case is one within the Church, and another without the Church. 2. It
is one in the case of a confused, or backs^^ding Church, another in the Church
rightly constitute and pure; without the Church, God intends nothing, either
in the intention of the worker or the work; but the external peace of humane
society: Then, I grant the Magistrate is at the first without any previous
labors of religious men, to save the soul of the offender, to take care of
peace and the conservation of humane society; But within the visible Church,
where the Gospel is preached, it is presumed, that God intends salvation in
regard of the intention of the work, the Gospel being preached to all within
the visible Church; if therefore any within the visible Church, fall in
horrible scandals, and such as are capital, in the intention of Gods
dispensation, without the Church, God intends nothing but peace; But in
regard of the intention of Gods dispensation, within the Church, where the
Gospel is preached, he intends both peace by the godly Magistrates care and
eternal life, by the preaching of the Gospel; Because therefore life eternal
is more necessary then external peace, it is necessary that the Church first
labor to try, cognosce of, and cure the man's soul by rebukes, threats,
conviction; and (if need be) by excommunication, that the souls of many may be
saved from the contagion of scandal, before the Magistrate punish either to
death, (if the scandal so deserve) or by any coactive way by the sword, the
genuine fruit whereof is not repentance and gaining of the man's soul, except by
accident and through the cooperation of a higher hand, above nature even of
free grace) but the external peace of the commonwealth; hence in a constitute
Church, the Magistrate is not to proceed with the sword against the body of any
Member of the Church, while the Church first try and attempt how to save his
soul; therefore the Magistrate is to sentence none as punishable by the sword,
while first he be labored on by the Church, and upon a previous sentence of
the Church; then must the Magistrates judging of a scandalous Churchmember be
subsequent, and the Churches judging antecedent: But, 2. If the Church be
remiss, this is a defect* and somewhat extraordinary; if the Magistrate
command the Church to do their duty, and they neglect to do it, the Magistrates
cognizance then may be antecedent and not consequent, and the case of a Church
erring in a fact, is, as if, in that fact, there were no Church.

Obj. 3. Those are subordinate to the Church, whose judgment and sentences are
subjected to the Church, to be tried or condemned by the Church, but the
judgment and sentences of the Magistrate are subjected to the Church; Ergo,
and by the like they prove, Pastors to be subjected to the Civil Magistrate,
because their preaching, their dispensing of the seals, their sentences in
their Presbytery are subjected to the Magistrate, so as he may absolve, or
condemn.

Ans. Vedelius shall never prove the Major, as touching the subjection or
subordination in question; he is subject to the Magistrate, whose sentence or
judgment is subject, in an antecedent cognizance, and in a coactive corporal
way, it is true: But now the assumption is false, in a constitute Church, the
sentence or thing sentenced or judged by the Church, is subject to the
Magistrate in a subsequent cognizance, and in a corporal coactive way only:
But not in an antecedent cognizance, and by a way of Ecclesiastical censuring;
we acknowledge a subordination of the Churches sentence to the Magistrate, in
regard of the Magistrates external care to punish iniquity in any; not in
regard of intrinsecall judging and dealing with the conscience, the Church is
to give a reason of their sentence from the Word of God, to the Magistrate when
he demands it.

Obj. 4. Ministers as Ministers are subjects of the King; Ergo, the King
judges them as Ministers.

Ans. I deny the antecedent: The Ministry as such is an Ordinance of God, and
cannot be judged; nor are Ministers, nor Painters as Painters, nor Musicians as
Musicians, nor Saylors as Saylors subjects; these reduplications be consening
and deceiving notions* painters as painters are regulated by Art, and subject
to be judged by painters; but as men they are subjects, and so are Ministers as
men subject to Caesar; as Ministers they are the servants of Christ, and not
subjects. Ob. As Ministers they are either Magistrates or subjects; but
Ministers as Ministers are not Magistrates: He that is not with Christ is
against him, M. Coleman in his Brotherly examination, p. 21. says, He that
does not manage his office under Christ, and for Christ, must manage it under
the Devil, and for the Devil; if therefore the Christian Magistrate do not
manage his office under, and for Christ, he must manage it under, or for the
Devil, which were blasphemous. Ans. I deny the Major proposition: Ministers as
Ministers are neither Magistrates, nor subjects; but formally the separated
servants of Christ, set a part for the work of gathering the Saints: Now to be
The Ministers as Ministers neither Magistrates nor subjects. The Magistrate as
such neither manageth his office under Christ as mediator, nor under Satan, but
under God as creator.
subjects, is to be judged by the Magistrate in those things, in which they are
subjects, that is, in all Civil business they are, and false teaching
discerned by the Church to be false teaching, or in case the Church corrupt
themselves, then are Ministers obnoxions to bodily punishment to be inflicted
by the Magistrate; But this is properly to be a subject of the Magistrate, to
be liable to the civil cognizance, trying, and bodily punishment inflicted by
the Magistrate, and to be a subject; and a member of the other Kingdom, is to
be subject to the Ecclesiastical cognizance, trial, and censure of the
Church, as a matter that concerns the soul; hence the former concerns the
body and outward man, the latter the inner man, and the soul. 2. The former
concerns peace with men and edification, to be procured by a mean
extrinsecall to edification, to wit, by the sword; the latter concerns peace
with God, by a spiritual sword, the Word of God. 3. The former is carnal, and
of the Kingdom of this world; the latter spiritual and of Christ's other
Kingdom, that is not of this world, Ioh. 18. 36. 4. The former works by
coaction and bodily violence; the latter by removing unwillingnesse and making
a rebellious soul obedient. 5. The former is an act of justice not terminated
on repentance, or the man's turning to God, as an end; for whether this end be
obtained, or no, the Magistrate is to use the sword, the other is terminated on
repentance, as its end: He that is not with Christ, is against Christ, and with
the Devil; Its true, in all professors of the Gospel* as professors, no man,
but he must be either on the one side, or on the other, either for, or with
Christ, or against him: But it is not true with every reduplication; thus
Ministers as Ministers are subjects of, or to the King, and to obey him in the
Lord, and so with Christ, has this sense, Ministers essentially and formally
are subjects of, or to the King to obey him in the Lord; so as Ministers do
lose the essence and formality of the office of the Ministry; if they be not
the Kings subjects, and with Christ; this is most false, for Judas should not
be a Minister of Christ then, in that he was not subject to the Law of Caesar,
that is, that the servant and disciple should be for, and under his master and
Lord, it only follows; Ergo, Judas was not a godly Minister, but under the
Devil, not under Christ; Magistrates do neither essentially as Magistrates
cleave to Christ, nor ^ight against Christ; but as holy men they cleave to
Christ, as sinful men they fight against Christ. 2. Master Coleman knows
that we speak of the office of a Magistrate as a Magistrate, not under the
accidents of Christian, or heathenish; there was no reason he should apply his
Argument to the Parliament, except to make us odious, as if we did not as much
honor or pray for the Parliament and King, as himself: But it concludes
equally against all Magistrates, and let him see it in a heathen Magistrate as
a Magistrate: for a heathen Magistrate as a Magistrate, does either manage his
office under Christ, and for Christ, or under the Devil, and for the Devil.
This I and Master Coleman also shall deny, for a heathen Magistrate as a
Magistrate, does not manage his office under, or for Christ, as mediator;
because he is utterly ignorant of Christ, for he has no more, but what God as
creator and nature gave him, says Master Coleman, page 20. and the other horn
of the Argument, is as weak for this, The heathen Magistrate as such manageth
his office under, or for the Devil, is blasphemous, for so Magistracy and the
office should be intrinsecally unlawful, and for the Devil: But it is
intrinsecally the Ordinance of God, Romans 13. and apply this to God as creator,
it shall appear of force. The Magistrate as the Magistrate, does either manage
his office under, and for God creator, or under, and for the Devil. The former
part is true, because God creator and nature made the office of Magistracy,
apply it to a heathenish husband, Father, Master, Musician, Painter, under
these reduplications and it shall make the relation of Husband Devilish, or
this proposition, (a Husband, a Father as a Father, and a Husband, manage their
office, under, and for Christ the mediator, or under, or for the Devil) is most
false and blasphemous: the former part is false; for there should have been,
and was Father and Husband which did manage the duties of these relations, for
God creator, not for Christ mediator; though Christ had never taken on our
nature, never been mediator, never been King and Priest of his redeemed Church.
The latter part is blasphemous, for then Adam had managed the part of Husband
and Father under the Devil, and for the Devil, even before he fell in sin,
and in the state of Innocence. 3. Mr. Colemans meaning is, that the Magistrate
as the Magistrate, and by office is under Christ mediator, as his supreme and
immediate vicegerent as mediator; now in this sense, Christ's saying ( he that
is not against us, is with us) shall not prove the truth of the proposition,
which must be this, and is most false, to wit, that (The Magistrate as the
Magistrate, by office, is either under Christ mediator, as the supreme and
immediate vicegerent of him as mediator, or he is by office under the Devil.)
This we deny, for one might argue thus of the Apostle Paul, who was either as
an Apostle for Christ, or against Christ; Paul as an Apostle is either under
Christ the mediator, and his supreme and immediate vicegerent, having power of
both Swords, or he is under the Devil: The proposition is most false; for Paul
is neither of them, so say we here; the Magistrate does neither manage his
office, as a Magistrate under Christ mediator, as his Vicar, and a little head
of the Church; nor yet does the Magistrate manage his office under, or for the
Devil, God save the Magistrate, datur tertium, he is for Christ as a Christian,
and as a Christian; but as a Magistrate he is not for Christ as mediator, that
is, as having his office of Christ as mediator, and being from Christ a
Magistrate, that is, as M. Coleman expounds it an officer, having power of
both the Swords: for Mr. Coleman says, p. 20. Christian Magistracy is an
Ecclesiastical administration; Ergo, he has the power of the Spiritual
Sword, and Paul, Romans 13. says, he has from God the power of the other Sword:
Yea, we cannot say that a Magistrate as a Magistrate, or a Minister as a
Minister, are either redeemed and saved in Christ, nor no redeemed, or no saved
in Christ, but in another reduplication: The Magistrate as a Magistrate, is not
redeemed, but as an elected man; nor is he damned, or not redeemed as a
Magistrate, but as a reprobate and an unbeleeving man; and the like* I say of a
Minister, he that is not with Christ, as his immediate and supreme swordbearer,
is not against Christ, for so all the world except the Prince, should be
against him.

Obj. 5. The Magistrate as he defends the body, and goods, so also the the
fame of men; hence what is a matter of good or ill report is judged by the
Magistrate, who may put ill doers to shame, Judge. c. 187. But Church scandals,
blasphemy, heresy, apostasy, are matters of ill report, and of shame; Ergo,
they are to be judged by the Magistrate.

Ans. Non concluditur negatum, We deny not but the Magistrate may judge and put
to shame offenders, but it is civil shame, by which the Magistrate judges any
offender to be an evil Citizen and hurtful member of the commonwealth, Judge.
18. 17. The Church has no power thus to judge, or thus to put to shame: But
there is an Ecclesiastical shame, in which the Church judges, whether such a
man be a sound and faithful subject of the Kingdom of Christ, or a hurtful
Member of the Church, and of this shame speaks Paul, 2 Thessalonians 3. 14. keep no
company with him, that he may be ashamed; and the same way we are to
distinguish, a good name for it is an honor, that it be said of any man, as
Psalm. 87. This man was borne in Zion.

Obj. 6. What the Magistrate as a Magistrate punishes, that as a Magistrate he
judges; but as a Magistrate he punishes Idolatry and heresy; Ergo, as a
magistrate he judges it.

Ans. What the Magistrate punishes, that he judges distinguo: What he
punishes, that he judges, the way that he punishes, for as he punishes
civilly and with the sword; so he judges in a civil way, not as a Church
scandal, but as a civil disturbance. 2. In a constitute Church, by a
subsequent judging after those whose lips should preserve knowledge, have
judged it to be Idolatry, and heresy; he is to judge it, and in order to
corporal punishment, its true, and thus the Major is granted: But the
assumption is false, for the Magistrate judges nothing as scandalous, no
Idolatry, or heresy, with an antecedent judgment, and with order to
Ecclesiastical punishment to gain the soul. Obj. But there is no other judging
or punishing required, but such as the magistrate inflicteth. Ans. This is a
false principle, and everteth all Church Government.

Obj. 7. But so you make two supreme magistrates, the King and the Church, two
collateral supremacies; yet so as the magistrates conscience lies under the
feet of the Church.

Ans. The Church has a Ministry, no dominion of Magistracy. 2. There is a
collaterality without equality. The Magistrate is highest and worthiest, the
other has no dignity, no supereminency, but to be authoritative declarers of
the mind of Christ. 3. The Magistrate is no more tied to the judgment of a
Synod, or Church, then any private man is tied in his practice* the tie in
Discipline and in all Synodicall acts and determinations, is here as it is in
preaching the Word, the tie is secondary, conditional, with limitation in so
far as it agrees with the Word, not absolutely obliging, not Papal, qua or
because commanded, or because determined by the Church, and such as
Magistrates, and all Christians may reject, when contrary to, or not warranted
by the Word of God.

Obj. 8. But Pastors have authority equally immediate and independent under
God, as the magistrate has, and what more can they have except the Crown and
Scepter? is not this an emulous and odious equality, beside a collaterality?
hence they cry the liberty, the liberty of the Kingdom of Christ, the right,
the power of the Church is taken away, so often as the magistrate punishes
scandals.

Ans. Non-subordination can never infer equality, who denies that the
Magistrate may command the Husband and Wife to do a duty to each other, the
father not to provoke the son, the son not to disobey the Father, the Pastor
and People, the Master and Servant, the Captain and Soldier, to do a duty
each, one to another. And there is a proper right and liberty, and power
immediately given by God, without the King or Magistrates interposing of their
authority: to all these, the Kings authority makes not the man a Father, nor
the Son subject to the Father, nor the Servant to the Master, nor the
Soldier to the Commander. God immediately made those powers, and God in the
Law of nature has given a power to the Father over the son, without the
Magistrate; yea, though there had never been a Magistrate in the world: so the
Pastors and Elders by divine institution, have a power and liberty to feed and
govern the flock, over which the Holy Ghost has made them overseers, and set
them over as those who must give an account to the great Shepherd, Acts 20. 28,
29. 1 These. 5. 12, 13. Heb. 13. 17. 1 Timothy 5. 17. now it no more follows that
all Fathers are equal to the Magistrate, all Masters, all Captains to the
King, then that the Church or Pastors are equal to the King, for Fathers,
Masters, Captains, Husbands have immediately from God in the Law of Nature, a
supreme, a high and independent Authority as the Church has, without any
intervention of the will or authority of King or any earthly Magistrate, and
without any subordination as they are such to the Prince. 2. The emulation
between the Magistrate and Pastors is no more in point of government, then in
point of preaching, exhorting, rebuking even of Kings and all that are in
Authority; now we have both demonstrated from the Word, and have the grant of
Adversaries, that in point of preaching and rebuking, the Pastors have an
immediate supremacy and independency under Jesus Christ; and all emulation
here, is from men who will no^ submit to the yoke of Christ. 3. If the
Magistrate should usurp over Husbands, and Masters and Fathers, their jus
maritale, herile, Paterum, and spoil them of Husband-power, and masterly and
fatherly power, as our Adversaries counsel the Magistrate to take the
spiritual right and power of the keys of the Kingdom of God, from the Church
and Pastors, the former should complain, as do the latter.

Object. 8. But if the Kingdom be heathenish, and the heart of the King be
first supernaturally affected, then Religion begins at him as a Magistrate,
and he may appoint gifted men after they are converted to preach the Gospel;
Ergo, The first rise of Religion is from the Magistrate as the Magistrate.

Ans. If the King be converted first as a Christian, not as a Magistrate, he
may spread the Gospel to others, and preach himself but not as a Magistrate,
as Iehoshaphat commanded the Levites to do their duty, so might he command
those of the house of Aaron, who had deserted the Priests office, to take the
office on them, to which God had called them, so here gifts and faithfulness
appearing to the new converted Prince, he is to command those so gifted, (for
their gifts and faithfulness is as evident a call as to be borne the sons of
Aaron,) to take on them the calling of preaching and of dispensing the Seals.
But* 1. he ordains them not Pastors as a Prince, but commands them to
follow the calling which now the Church not constitute, cannot give. 2. He can
preach himself as a gifted believer, in an extraordinary exigence, A Prince as
a gifted Christian may preach and spread the Gospel to a land where the
Gospel has not bin heard before, but not as a Magistrate.
but he cannot do this as a Magistrate, yea, Moses did never prophecy as a
Magistrate, nor David as a King. 2. All the rise that Religion has from the
Prince as the Prince in this case is civil, that men gifted may be commanded
by civil Authority, to dispense Word and Sacraments, but nothing
Ecclesiastical is here done by the Prince as the Prince. 3. The highest power
in the Church as the Church, and the highest amongst men, as men, are much
different. The Magistrates power in commanding that this Religion that is true
and consonant to the Word of God be set up, and others that are false be not
set up in his Kingdom, is a civil power, and due to him as a Magistrate, but
a highest Church power, to dispense Word and Sacraments agrees to no
Magistrate as a Magistrate; but it follows not, that when the true Religion
is erected by his power as a Magistrate, that he may as a Magistrate dispense
Word, Sacraments, and Synodicall acts and censures; except God have called him
to preach the Word, and to use the sword of the other Kingdom, as a Member of

authority from the word of another, and so it is but imperium alienum, a
borrowed power, he is subject properly to Christ speaking in his Word. Titius
is subject to the King properly, but unproperly to the Kings Herald.

Ans. 1. Let the subjection be unproper, there can no conclusion from thence be
drawn against us, If 1. The Pastors as Pastors have their commissions from
Christ and be his immediate Servants, and have no Commission Pastoral from the
Magistrate, as the power of the Herald flows immediately from the royal
power of the King, and he is the Kings immediate servant; then to obey him in
those acts which he performs in the Kings name, is to obey the King; and in
those acts subjects do properly obey the Herald; and so here Heb. 13. Obey
those that are over you in the Lord, according to that, He that hears you,
hears me, he that despises you despises me. 2. It is enough for our purpose
that Magistrates are so to obey Pastors in the Lord, and Pastors are so
supreme under Christ as the Magistrate is not above them, and they have their
Embassage, calling, and commission immediately from Jesus Christ, without the
intervention of the Magistrates Authority.

Obj. But the obedience of the Magistrate to the Pastors, is not absolute, but
conditional, if they command in the Lord; Ergo, It is no kindly obedience and
subjection.

Ans. It follows not, for so we should give no kindly obedience to Kings, to
Parents, to Masters, for we obey them only conditionally in the Lord, as they
warrant their Commandment from the Word. Yet Vedelius will not say, it is
unproper subjection we owe to the King, nor can he say that the Royal power is
imperium alienum, a begged power, all obedience to men this way is begged, and
if we come to Logic, if I should say the nature and definition of obedience
agrees not univocally to obedience to God, and to obedience to the creature,
Vedelius should hardly refute me. It is enough Ministers of the Gospel
discharge an Embassage in the room and place of God, 2 Cor. 5. 20. God
commands in his Ministers, a limited obedience, is kindly obedience.

of the Testimony to King Iehoash, when they made him King, the Priests indeed
kept the book of the Law in the side of the Arc, but as servants of the King,

Ans. You may see solid answers to this, in Walens, Cabel Iavius, and Iac.
Triglandius. 1. The book of the Law was given to the King for his practice,
that he might fear the Lord his God, and his heart not be lifted up above his
brethren, Deuteronomy. 17. 18, 19, 20. and this was common to him, with the Priests
and all the people of God, but to the King in an exemplary and special manner,
that 1. The people might follow his Example, and therefore these same words
which concern the practice of the King, Deuteronomy. 17. 19. are also given to the
people, Deuteronomy. 6. 2. and 10. 13. and 111, 2, 13, 22. and 12. 1, 2, 28. and 13.
4. and 27. 1. and 28. 1. with a little change, sure no change that by any

rebuked for his neglect in this: both these we may read of the Priests every
where in the Prophets, Deuteronomy. 33. 10. Mal. 2. 7. Lev. 10. 10, 11. Ier. 2. 8. and
6. 13, 14. Hos. 4. 6, 7, 8. Deuteronomy. 17. 11, 12. yea the book of the Law is put

the Levites, which bare the Arc of the Covenant of the Lord, saying, 26. Take
this book of the Law, and put it in the side of the Arc of the Covenant of the
Lord your God. Now if the Priests had been only the Kings servants immediately
subordinate to the King, and mediately only to Jesus Christ, the Arc, all the
holy things, the book of the covenant, the burning of incense before the Lord,
had been principally and first enjoined to the King. Ezra the Priest read the
book of the Law, not Nehemiah; nor was it ever commanded that the King should
read it in the hearing of the people, and give the sense of it, as the Priests
were to do by their office; Hilkiah 2 Kin. 22. found the book of the Law that
was lost, and Shaphan the Scribe read it before the King, that they might see
their Apostacy, and Josiah might accordingly reform, 2 King. 22 9, 10.

Ans. The Major is false, and the Assumption untrue also, and all that the
conclusion can bring forth, is, that the Prince has 1. An external coactive
care by way of dominion to procure the removal of Wolves from the fold. 2. To
procure the good of the Church, in order to a natural and civil good. 3. To
procure good to the Church as the Church in a coactive way, by the sword, in
punishing Idolators. 2. The Church as the Church is not subordinate to the
Prince, but as Subjects of the common wealth, because he by a coactive power
may procure the good of the Church as the Church; for indirectly and by the
sword, the Magistrate defending godliness, and procuring the good of souls, does
not prove that his dominion and sword extends to their souls, or that he
watches for their souls, as Heb. 13. 17.

and to be judged, to sit on the Bench, and stand at the bar of Christ Jesus,
is as impossible as to reconcile the East and the West together, so The
Bloody Tenent, I demand if the Church be a Delinquent, who shall judge? It is
answered the, magistrate. Again if the magistrate be a delinquent, I ask who
shall judge it? It is answered, The Church. Whence I observe (which is, in most
cases of the world monstrous) that one person, to wit, the Church or the
Magistrate, shall be at one time C. 65. ^a. 123.
the delinquent at the Bar, and the judge upon the Bench: for the Church must
judge when the magistrate offends; and yet the magistrate must judge when the
Church offends, whether she contem^^ civil authority, in the Second Table for
thus dealing with him, or whether she has broken the rules of the first table
of which (say they) God has made him a keeper and preserver, what blood, what
tumults has been, and must be spilt upon these grounds? Ib. so C. 85. pa. 124.
the Church calls one of her members to office, and ordains him an officer:
The Magistrate opposes him as an unworthy officer, and according to his
conscience suppresseth him; upon this the Church complains of the Magistrates
violation of her privileges, and that he is turned persecutor, and not
prevailing with admonition, She excommunicateth the Magistrate: The Magistrate
again not enduring such violation of ordinances, he cutteth off with the sword,
such prophaners of ordinances.

Ans. All this is but wind, devised against the Magistrates punishing The

of Idolaters, and I show the same follows upon the Magistrates, or Church
erring, the one in abusing civil authority, or the other in profaning
ordinances, or preaching the word; for instance, The Judges of a land, or of
Jerusalem, make grievous and bloody decrees against the poor, the widows and
the Orphane: A faithful Isaiah, a zealous preacher by authority from the Lord,
judges and condemns according to his conscience, these judges, and cries
out, as Isai. 10. 1 in the name of the Lord* before all the Congregation: Woe
be to you who decree unrighteous decrees, and write (in the Bench)
grievousnesse, to turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away right
from the poor: Now the Magistrate that decreed those decrees, judges in his
conscience they are righteous decrees, and he according to his conscience no^
enduring that Isaiah or any preacher should thus abuse and profane so holy an
Ordinance of prophesying, and preaching: as to preach lies in the name of the
Lord, he proceeds in his civil court, and cu^teth off with the sword such
false Prophets, because they ^lander the Lords anointed, and preach lies of
him: is not here a reciprocation of judging in the same cause? What will the
Author say to this? O says he, the Magistrate ought not to use his sword
against those Prophets, for they preach according to their conscience the truth
of God: But say that Shimei were a Prophet, and he calls David his Prince a
bloody murderer; and says, this evil is come on him, for rising up against
Saul his Master; The Magistrate may not punish him with the Sword, for railing
against the Lords anointed. 2. And if the Magistrate ought not to strike with
the sword any Prophet, for preaching according to his conscience, for that is
persecution to this Author; how shall the Prophets judge and condemn the
Magistrate, for those same decrees which he has given out according to his
conscience? for this is a persecution with the tongue, Mat. 5. 11. Job 19. 22.
and it is one and the same spiritual cause, says this Author. 3. The same
very Author and the Parliament, do reciprocally judge and condemn one another;
for the Parliament make war against Papists, for drawing the King on their
side, and causing him make war against the Lamb and his followers, that is,
against godly Protestants: Now suppose Priests and Jesuits, preach this to the
Queen and other Papists, and they according to their conscience make war
against the flock of Christ, and the Parliament according to their conscience
make war against them: this Author sits down, and judges and condemns
both sides as bloody persecutors, for point of conscience: Now though the
Author in his Bench with his pen condemns and judges both according to his
conscience; yet if the Papists or possibly the Parliament, had this Author in
their fingers, might not they reciprocally judge and condemn him? I think he
cannot deny; how justly they should reciprocally judge the Author, I cannot
say. 3. This Author would have a contradiction, such as is to make East and
West both one, that one and the same man both sit in the Bench, and stand at
the bar, that the Church judge the Magistrate, and the Magistrate judge the
Church: But I hope contradictions were no more under the Old Testament to be
admitted, nor under the New. Now in the Old Testament the King might put to
death the Prophet, who should prophecy blasphemies, and again the Prophet might
judge the King, by denouncing the judgment of the Lord against the King; let
the Author say how the King, both did sit in the Bench, and stand at the ba^^e
in diverse respects: I think A^hab might judge and punish Micaiah unjustly, for
prophesying that he should dye at Ramoth Gilead, and Micaiah might in prophecy
give out the sentence of death justly against him* but here be two contrary
sentences, the like may fall out in Synodicall constitutions. 2. To answer to
his reasons. 1. It follows not that in one and the same spiritual respect,
one and the same person judges on the Bench, and is judged at the Bar; for the
Churches judging is in a spiritual respect, as the officer ordained, may
promote the building of Gods House, the Magistrates suppressing him is no
spiritual respect; but as it disturbeth the peace of the State, that so
unworthy a person is an officer in Gods House, and is hurtful to the Church of
God in their edi^icatio^, which the Magistrate is to promote not in spiritual,
but in a civil coactive way, by the power of the sword. 3. That one judge on
the Bench, and the same stand at the Bar and be judged, at diverse and sundry
times, is not so impossible, by far, as to reconcile East and West together;
A^^^b may judge Naboath to be condemned and stoned for his vineyard to day, and
immediately after Elias the Prophet may arraigne him before the Bar and
tribunal of God to be condemned, and adjudged to dye in the portion of
Iezreel, where the dogs may lick his blood: It is true Elias is not properly a
judge, but a declarer, in a prophetical and authoritative way of the judgment
of God; but this is all the judicial power which we ascribe to Church, or
Presbytery and Pastors; they are mere Ministers or servants to declare the will
and sentence of God: When the Minister preaches wrath against the King for his
sins, he judges the King in a Pastoral and Ministerial way, which is all we
contend for, in many officers united in a Church way, and at that same time,
the King has power after that, to judge him for preaching treason for ^ound
Doctrine; if it be found to be treason by the Church, and this reciprocation of
judging we maintain as consistent and necessary in Ministers of Gospel and
Magistrates: But such a distance between them, as between East and West, we
see not. The Author should have shown it to us by his own grounds: The Church
may excommunicate a Magistrate as a persecutor, who cutteth off Idolaters for
their conscience; yet the godly Magistrate may judge and punish them with the
sword, for abusing the ordinance of Excommunication, so as to excommunicate the
godly Magistrate, because he does punish evil doing with the Sword, Romans 13.
4. 4. The Author infers that tumults and bloods do arise from these two* But
that will not prove these two to be inconsistent and contr^dictorious; tumults
and blood arise from preaching the Gospel, what then? Ergo, the Gospel is a
mass of contradictions, ^^ follows not: The ^umul^s and blood have their
rise from men's lusts, who are impatient of the yoke of Christ, not from these
two powers to judge Ecclesiastically in the Church, and to be judged civilly by
the Magistrates: The Author draws his instance to the actual judging of the
same thing contradictory ways; for example, the Church ordains one to be a
preacher, and this they do Ecclesiastically, and the Magistrate actually
condemns the same man civilly as unworthy to be a preacher: It is one thing
to say, that the Church has power to judge righteously in an Ecclesiastical
way any matter, and another (that the Christian Magistrate has power in a
civil way, to judge righteously the same matter) and a ^ar other thing it is
to say, The Church has a power Ecclesiastically God has not given a power to
the magistrate and Church and to judge contrary ways, justly and unjustly in
one and the same cause.
to judge a matter righteously, according to the word, and the Magistrate has
power to judge the same matter civilly in a wrong and unjust way; the former we
say, God has given a power to the Church to ordain Ecclesiastically,
Epaphroditus to be a preacher of the Gospel, because these graces and gifts are
in him that are requisite to be in a faithful preacher; and God has also
given a power to the Christian Magistrate to add his civil sanction to the
ordination and calling of the same Epaphroditus: But we do not teach that God
has given to the Church, a power to call Epaphroditus to the Ministry in an
Ecclesiastical way, and that God has given a power to the Christian
Magistrate to anull this lawful ordination of Epaphroditus: Now the Author
puts such a supposition, that Church and Magistrate have two lawful powers
toward contrary acts; the one of them a power to give out a just sentence, the
other a power to give out an unjust sentence in one* and the same cause, which
we teach not: God gave to none either* in Church or State a power to unjustice,
ad malum n^^la* est potestas.

Obj. 14. How can the Magistrate determine, what the true Church and ordinances
are, and then set them up with the power of the sword? and how can he give
judgment of a ^alse Church, false Ministry, false Doctrine, and false
Ordinances, and so pull them down by the sword? and yet you say the Magistrate
is to give no spiritual judgment of these, nor has he any spiritual power
for these Bloody Te. c. 84. p. ^22.
ends and purposes. Bloody Tenent.

Ans. The Magistrate judges of these as a Magistrate, not in a Pastoral way or
Ecclesiastically; for then by office, he should be a preacher of the Gospel,
but civilly as they are agreeable, or contrary to the Laws of the Commonwealth
made concerning Religion, and in order to the civil praise and reward of
stipends, wages, or benefices, or to the bodily punishment inflicted by the
sword, Romans 13. 4, 5. So, though the object be spiritual, yet the judging is
civil, and the Magistrates power in setting up true, or pulling down false
ordinances, is objectively spiritual or civilly good, or ill (to speak so)
against the duty, or agreeable to that which men owe as they are members of a
civil incorporation, a City or Commonwealth: But the same power of the
Magistrate is formally, essentially in it self, civil, and of this world.

CHAP. XXVI.
Quest. 22.
Whether appeals are to be made from the Assemblies of the Church, to the
civil Magistrate, King or Parliament? and of Paul his appeal to Caesar.

FOr the clearer explanation of the question, its possible these considerations
may help to give light, 1. There be these opinions touching the point: Some
exclude the Magistrate from all care Bellarmine de laicis c. 17. c. 18.
of Church Discipline, ^. As Jesuits and Papists will have Princes not to
examine what the Church, the Pope and the cursed Clergy of Rome decrees in
their Synods. To these the Sorbonists of Paris oppose, and the Parliament of
France cause to be burnt by the hand of the hangman, any writings of Jesuits
that diminishes the just right of the Magistrate. 2. Those who in the
Low Countries did remonstrate under the name of Arminians, as they are called,
hold, that the Magistrate ought to tolerate all Religions, even Turcisme and
Iudaisme not excepted, because the conscience of man cannot be compelled: Some
of them were Socinians* as Henry Slatius, who says right down, he that uses
the sword, or seeks a Magistracy* Slatius i^ aperta declaratione. p. 53.

is not a Christian; yea, war is against the command of Jesus Christ, or in any
terms to kill any; says Henry Welsingius, Episcopius their chief man will
have the Magistrate, going no further then real or bodily mulcts or fines,
Joan. Geisteranus pronounces it unlawful to be a Magistrate to use the sword:
But all say the Magistrate ought not to use the sword against Heretics,
Blasphemers, Idolaters, or against any man, for his conscience or Religion. 3.
Those that think the Magistrate bear the sword lawfully, yet do confine him to
the defense of the half of Gods Law, the duties of the second Table, and not
to these all, but to such as border not directly on conscience; for if some
should sacrifice their children to Molech and Devils, as some do, the
Magistrate were not to punish them, it being a joint of their Religion and a
matter of conscience: and all these will be found to give to the Magistrate as
the Magistrate, just as little as Jesuits do in the matters of Religion, and
that is right down nothing, except possibly the Magistrate be of their
Religion only, whom he Governs only as a Christian man; the Magistrate has
more with these, then with Papists. 4. Erastus gives all in Doctrine and
Discipline, both in power and exercise to the Magistrate, even to the
dispensing of Word and Sacraments. 5. Others forsaking Erastus in a little, But
following him in the main, deny power of order. 2. Power of internal
jurisdiction grants to him all the external government of the Church. 6. We
hold that the Magistrate keeps both Tables of the Law, and that he has an
inspection in a civil coactive way, in preserving both Tables of the Law; but
that he is not as a Magistrate a member of the Church, but as a Christian only.

2. The exercise of Discipline is one thing, and the exercise of it, (as the
modus) the way of exercising of it, either in relation to Ecclesiastical
constitutions, or in relation to the politic and civil Laws of a
Commonwealth, is a far other thing.

3. As the Church is to approve and commend the just sentence of the civil
judge in punishing ill doers, but only conditionally in so far as it is just,
so is the magistrate obliged to follow, ratify, and with his civil sanction to
confirm the sound constitutions of the Church: But conditionally, not
absolutely, and blindely, but in so far as they agree with the Word of God.

4. Hence there is a wronging of the Church as the Church, and a civil
wronging of the Magistrate as the Magistrate, or of the members of the Church
as such, or of the members of the Commonwealth as such, the former and the
latter both cannot belong to one judicature: No more then the failing of a
Painter against the precepts of Art, because he has drawn the colors,
proportion, and the countenance beside the samplar, and the failing not against
Art, but against the Laws of the King, in that he has lavished out too much
gold in the drawing of the image, does belong to one judgment; for the Painter
as a Painter, according to the Law of Art, must judge of the former, and the
Magistrate as a Magistrate of the latter.

5. An appellation is one thing, and the complaint of an oppressed It is one
thing to complain to the Magistrate, another thing to appeal. What an appeal is.
man is another thing; or a provocation to a competent judge is one thing, and
the refugium, the refuge and fleeing of an oppressed man to a higher power, is
another thing; if the Church err and fail against the Law of Christ in the
matter, and decree, the man to be a heretic, who is none, and that to be
heresy which is truth; the oppress^d man in a constituted Church may have his
refuge to the godly Magistrate and complain, but he cannot appeal, for an
appellation is from an erring judge to an higher judge, in eadem s^rie, in the
same nature and kind of judicatures, as from a civil Court to a higher civil
Court, and from an Ecclesiastical Court to a higher; as suppose the Church of
Antioch judge that the Gentiles must be circumcised, the godly there may appeal
to the judgment of Apostles and Elders, in a Council conveened from Antioch
and Jerusalem both: and therefore because the Magistrate can no more judge what
is heresy, what truth, as a Magistrate, then he can dispense Word and
Sacraments; an appeal cannot be made to him, who is no more a judge, ex
officio, nor he can dispense the Sacraments ex officio, but a complaint may be
made to the Magistrate; if the Church fail in their judging, the Magistrate is
to command the Church to judge it over again, but the Magistrate cannot judge
it himself; as there is a complaint made to the Magistrate that the P^inter
has not drawn the image exactly, according to the samplar, the Magistrate
judges not of the Art of the Painter, nor can the Magistrate as the Magistrate
draw the image himself; But the Magistrate may judge of the Painters breach of
promise, who did ^action to draw it exactly according to the samplar, and has
not kept faith to the man who pays him wages; and therefore the Magistrate
may either punish his* moral error, his breach of promise, not his error of
Art, (the faculty or company of Painters must judge of of that) or then command
the Painter to paint the same image again, according as the Painter
convenanted: But it may be objected, You then make the Magistrate to meddle no
more with matters of faith, and preaching truth or falsehood, and giving out
Ecclesiastical rules in Church government, as Act. 15. then he meddleth with
painting according to the principles of Art; now painting according to Art
belongs not at all to the conscience of the Magistrate, but sound preaching;
right ruling in Gods house, belongs in a far nearer relation to the
conscience of the godly Magistrate. I Answer, As touching the formal judging
Ecclesiast^cally, and as concerning this, that the Magistrate should say, it
seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to me* or his dispensing of Word and
Sacraments, or his burning incense before the Lord, it no more belongs to him
as a Magistrate, to do these in his own person formally; because God has not
called him to act these, then it belongs to him to paint an Image, to sew
shoes, to si^ at the helm of a Ship, and stir and guide her to such a Port,
as is clearer, Heb. 5. 4. 1 Cor. 7. 17. 21. Romans 10. 14. 1 Timothy 5. 17. and 3.
1, 2, 3. Act. 13. 23. and 20. 28, 29, 30. Heb. 13. 17. 2 Chro. 26. 18, 19, 20,
21. But in another consideration, as sound or unsound dispensing of Word and
Sacraments, as right or unjust ruling in the house of God, may more or less
hurt, or benefit the souls of men, which he is to care for indirectly, in
ordine ad penas vel premia civilia et corporalia; it belongs more to the
Magistrate, to take care of the Church, of Religion, of preaching and,
governing Gods house, then any painting or Arts in the earth: Refuge to the
Magistrate, is not an appeal.
Again, the Church proceeding in these things, that are against common justice
in all judicatures, no less then in the Church, as to condemn the party never
heard, or not convinced, either by confession, or under two sufficient
witnesses, or to do manifest unjustice in the manner of proceeding, leaves a
clear place to the wronged party, by the Law of nature* if not to appeal* yet
to flee and have re-course to the Christian Magistrate, who is Par^ns Patrie*
the father of the Common wealth*

6. The question may* either be of any really* wronged by the Church whether he
may appeal to the Magistrate, or whether he who either believes, or thinks,
or falsely lies, and says that he was wronged, may appeal to the Magistrate.

7. An Appeal is different from a Declinature, a Declinature is properly a
refusing to be judged, because the judge is incompetent, and the business
belongs not to him; those who follow Erastus, and deny all power of censures
to the Church, do decline, but not appeal from the Church, thinking the Church
has no power at all to judge or censure the scandalous. An Appeal is properly
from the same inferior judicature, to a superior judge, in eadem A twofold
appeal.
serie, in the same kind, and it is either proper or unproper: Proper it is,
when a particular Church does appeal to a Synod of many Churches in the same
place: Unproper, when either a wronged person has recourse to one or many
Pastors of Authority, as Chrysostom, Flavianus, Athanasius appealed to the
Bishop of Rome, that he would request the Church to proceed orderly: Or, 2. The
godly Magistrate would command that the Church would unpartially proceed to
right an oppressed man, as Cabeljavius says. Or, 3. When there is no Synods to
be had, then as Triglandius De Lib. Eceles. c. 9. p. 134, 135. Iac. Trig. de
civili and Ecclesiastic. potest. ^. 20. p. 420. 421.
says well from Beza, the Christian Magistrate may provide ^it means of
releeving the oppressed.

8. This would ever be remembered, that in case of the Churches erring in
judgment, which must be thought of as a sort of extraordinary case, the godly
Magistrate may do more, then what ordinarily he can do; and so may the Church,
when the Magistrate oppresses in judgment, as great Iunius says.

9. We grant when any complains to the Magistrate, that they are oppressed in
judgment by the Church, that the Church is obliged to give an account of their
doings, but that from common charity to remove the scandal, and that they owe
to all Christians, as may be evidently collected from 1 Pet. 4. 15. but this
will not prove a subordination to common Christians as to Judges, nor yet to
the Magistrate. 2. The Magistrate, when his judging is deemed scandalous, is to
give an account to the preachers of the Gospel, who watch for his soul: as King
Saul gave an account to Samuel, (with a false Apology, I grant) that he had
obeyed the Commandment of the Lord; but if Saul had been faultlesse in sparing
^gag and the cattle, yet was he obliged to give an account to Samuel. But that
will not prove that King Saul was subordinate to Samuel to be judged of him,
because Prophets are but servants and Ministers to declare Gods will, yet is it
all the subordination that we require in this, according to that, And the
people believed the Lord and Moses. Now all the Arguments before alleged to
prove that Pastors as Pastors are not subordinate in their pastoral acts to
the civil Magistrate, do also prove that there is no appeal from the Church in
an Ecclesiastical business to the civil Magistrate: For 1. If two Painters
contend touching any controversy in the mystery of their Art, they cannot
appeal to the King as Judge; the King then should formally be a painter, and
which is absurd, not by accident; but as a King and so here, if the King were
the judge, to whose determination we might appeal from the Church in a Church
controversy, sure the King as King should be a Church Officer: if the Priests
in controversy touching burning incense, or offering strange fire to God,
should appeal to the decision of the King as the King; sure the King in that as
King should be an eminent High Priest, and right of burning incense to the
Lord, should belong to him, in as far as the Kings lips in that controversy
should preserve knowledge, and they should seek the Law from his mouth, which
is proper to the Priests, Mal. 2. 7. Ezekiel. 22, 26. and 44. 23, 24. Deuteronomy. 17. 11.

2. The Church of Antioch should have appealed to Caesar, if he had been a
Christian, in the controversy touching circumcision; he should have determined
who were perverters of souls, who not, and should have said by his office, as
Emperor, It seemed good to the holy Ghost and to me. 3. We have not any
practice, or precept or promise in the Old or New Testament, for any such
appeal, except they say, all hard questions belonging to the Priests office
were to come before Moses as a civil Magistrate, and not as the great Prophet
to whom God revealed his mind. 4. If so, then all Church controversies in
doctrine and discipline, should be ultimately resolved into the will of the
Magistrate, speaking according to the word, and faith in most points should
come by hearing a Magistrate determining against Arrius, that Christ is God
consubstantiall with the Father, and all binding and loosing in Earth as in
heaven, should be from the Magistrate as the Magistrate, he should forgive and
retain sins, and Christ should have given the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven
to the Magistrate as the Magistrate, certainly we should have the doctrine of
the Church of Christ, and the building and edifying thereof most obscure in the
New Testament, in which there is not one word of such a supreme and chief
officer as the Magistrate. 5. The Parliament, college of civil judges, as
they are civil Magistrates, should be the Church assemblies, and determine all
doctrines, debar the ignorant and Heretics, and Apostates from the
Sacraments, and totally cast them out of the Church and excommunicate them; I
see not but then the Parliament as the Parliament is the Church, and the two
Kingdoms, Ioh. 18. 36. must be confounded, and no difference at all made
between the civil state and the Church, because the Magistrate as the
Magistrate is made by the adversaries the chief officer over the Church, the
Ecclesiastical head, the mixed Governor, half civil, whole Ecclesiastical,
in whose power all Pastors, Elders preach, dispense Sacraments, make
Church-canons, as his Ministers and Servants; Christ when any brother
trespasseth against a Christian brother says, Tell the Church, never, Tell the
christian Magistrate. But truly it is a great mistake in the learned Mr. Pryn
to call them Anti-Monarchicall, Anti-Parliamentary, and Novators, who deny that
the Parliament has any Nomothetick power in Church-canons. Nor has he in any
measure answered the Arguments of those Learned and godly Divines, Mr. John
Goodwin, and Mr. Hen: Burton; he is pleased to cite the practice of many
Parliaments of England, who laudably impatient of the Popes yoke, have made
Church-canons, when the man of sin sat upon the neck of the Christian church;
but these numerous citations of Parliaments and Councels in time of Popery
conclude nothing against us, who grant when the Church is not her self, the
christian Magistrate may extraordinarily reform and take from the man of sin
his usurped power, but in a constituted Church the case must be otherwise: and
1. Whereas he proves Emperors and Kings to have a power to Mr. Pryn his Truth
Triumphing sect. 2. and 3. p. 7, 8, etc.
convocate Councels; It has not strength against us, all our Divines teach so.
But how, 1. an accumulative civil power, so Jewel, Alley, Bilson, Whitaker,
Willet, White, Roger, he might have cited more; but no privative, no
Ecclesiastical power, so as Synods may not lawfully conveen without the
command of the civil Magistrate; our Divines say many Synods and Church
meetings were in the Apostolic Church without the consent and against the
will of the civil Magistrate; our Divines oppose the Pope, who claims the
only accumulative, civil, privative, and Ecclesiastic power to convocate
Synods, and that no Synods are lawful without the consent and mandate of the
holiness of such a Beast. 2. Master Prinne says, The Magistrate has power to
direct, for 16. Sect. 13* 14, 15, 16.
time and place, and to limit for matter and manner, the proceedings, liberty
and freedom of all Church Assemblies: But, 1. he asserteth this in the most,
from corrupt practices. 2. He proves, Laymen should have hand as well in
Synods, as Clergymen, the one having interest Prinne. Truth Triump. p. 31. The
Magistrates punishing, or his interest of faith proves him not be a judge in
Synods.
in the faith, as well as the other. Ans. Then must all the people be members
of Synods, for all have alike interest of Faith: but this proves not interest
of defining, which is the question; in dispensing Word and Sacraments, they
have interest of trying all things, as well as Pastors: but it follows not;
Ergo, they may dispense Word and Sacraments, no less; yea, more principally
then Pastors, as Erastus says, the Magistrate more principally determines
Synodicall constitutions: Hence this is easily answered, we may appeal in
Church business to him as to the supreme judge, who may punish the erring
Church and Pastors; but the Magistrate may in Church business do this: For
answer, 1. I retort it, the Magistrate in making civil Laws, that must in
their morality be determined by the Word of God, may appeal to Pastors, whose
lips by office should preserve knowledge; Ergo, the Magistrate in making civil
Laws, may appeal to the Pastor, which is absurd. 2. If men in
Church-constitutions may appeal to the Magistrate, as to one who may in his
person determine Synodically in Assemblies above all the Pastors, 1. Because
Magistrates may punish the Pastors erring and oppressing in Synods. 2. Because
the Magistrate and all laymen have interest in the faith, as well as Pastors,
then may people in hearing the Word and receiving the Sacraments, and in all
Pastoral rebukings and threatenings, in believing of all Gospel promises and
threatenings, and fundamental truths, appeal from Pastors to Magistrates as
Magistrates, and Magistrates as such may determine all fundamental truths, all
conscionall promises and rebukes; and that is, formally they may preach, (for
he that can distinguish these has a good engine) Because Magistrates may
punish heretical preaching, and superstitions, and idolatrous abusing of the
Sacraments by preachers, and Magistrates and all Laymen have interest of Faith,
in Word, Doctrine, and Sacraments, as in Discipline; yea, the Magistrate may
punish the Priest that offered strange fire to the Lord, offered bastard
incense; and the people had their interest of says, in sacrifices offered for
their own sins: but can it follow, therefore the Magistrate might sacrifice and
burn incense in his own person, as Mr. Pryn will have him to make Churchlaws
in his own person: Other Arguments of Mr. Pryns are light; Truth triumphing,
sect. 2. 31, 32.
as, that there were brethren, and Laymen that had hand in the Council at
Jerusalem, Acts 15.

Ans. This is nothing for Magistrates as Magistrates, but all Christians as
Christians so must have hand in Synods, which I grant in so far as concerns
their faith and practice, that they try all things, and try the Spirits whether
they be of God or not; but will it follow, Ergo, Magistrates as Magistrates are
those only who govern the Church, and make all Ecclesiastical constitutions,
as having in them all power of Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and deriving it to
Bishops and Pastors at the second hand, as Mr. Pryn says in the same book.

Obj. But the King is head of the Church; Ergo, he makes laws Page 31.
to regulate the Family.

Ans. The Antecedent is false, if not blasphemous; it is proper to Jesus Christ
only, Col. 1. 18. Ephesians. 1. 22. The King is the head of men, who are the Church
materialiter, he is not formally as King, Head of the Church as the Church; and
therefore we see not how this Statute agrees with the Word of God, Henric. 8.
Stat. 37. c. 17. The Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, and other
Ecclesiastical persons have no manner of Jurisdiction Ecclesiastical, but by,
under, and from the Kings Royal Majesty, the only and undoubted supreme head
of the Church of England and Ireland, to whom by holy Scripture is given all
authority and power, to hear and determine all manner of causes
Ecclesiastical, and to correct all vice and sin whatsoever* for neither is the
subject, the Archbishops, Bishops, etc. lawful, nor is the limitation of the
subject lawful, for Ecclesiastical officers are the Ambassadors of Christ, not
of the King.

Obj. All Christians are to try the Spirits* Ergo, Much more Magistrates.

Ans. This proves that Christians as Christians, and Magistrates as
Christians, may judge and determine of all things that concerns their
practice, and that they are not with blind obedience to receive things; Mr.
Pryn cannot say, that 1 John 4. 1. is meant of a Royal, Parliamentary, or
Magistraticall trial, John speaks to Christians as such: But this is nothing
to prove the power of the Magistrate as the Magistrate, for thought the man
were neither King nor Magistrate, he ought to try the Spirits, 1 John 4. 1. Of
Paul's appeal to Caesar, that it proves not that in Ecclesiastical
controversies we may appeal to Heathen or Christian Magistrates as to Judges of
matters Ecclesiastic, from the Church.


The special objection moved for Appeals is, that which Paul did in a matter
of Religion, that we may do in the like case, but Paul, Acts 25. did appeal
from a Church Judge to a civil and a heathen Judge, in a matter of Religion,
when he said before Festus Acts 25. I appeal to Caesar; Ergo, so may the
Ministers of Christ far more appeal to the Christian Magistrate, and that Paul
did this jure, by Law, not by Privilege, but by the impulsion of the Holy
Ghost, is clear, in that he says, He ought to be judged by Caesar; so
Maccovius, so Videlius, so Vtenbogardus, so Erastus.

Ans. 1. This Argument, if it have nerves, shall make the great Turk, when he
subdueth people and Churches of the Protestant Religion, to be the head of the
Church; and as Erastus says, by his place and office as he is a Magistrate, he
may preach and dispense the Sacraments, and a Heathen Nero may make Church
constitutions, and say, It seemed good to the holy Ghost and to me; and by
this, Nero by office is to excommunicate, make or unmake Pastors and Teachers,
judge what is Orthodoxe Doctrine, what not, debar heretics, Apostates and
mockers from the Table, and admit the worthy; and Paul the Apostle must have
been the Ambassador and Deputy of Nero in preaching the Gospel, and governing
the Church, and Nero is the mixed person, and invested by Jesus Christ with
spiritual jurisdiction, and the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. This Argument
to the Adversaries cannot quit its cost, ^or by this way Paul appealed from the
Church in a controversy of Religion, to a Nero, a Heathen unbaptized Head of
the Church, and referred his faith over to the will, judgment, and
determination of a professed Enemy of the Christian Church; and Paul must both
jure by the Law of God, and the impulsion of the Holy Ghost, appeal from the
Church to a Heathen without the Church, in a matter of Religion and Conscience;
then Nebuchadnezzar was head of the Church of Judah, and supreme judge and
governor in all causes and controversies of Religion, how can we believe the
adversary, who do not believe themselves? and shall we make Domitian,
Dioclesian, Trajan, and such heads of the Church of Christ?

2. It is not said that Paul appealed from the Church or any Ecclesiastical
judicature to the civil judge; for Paul appealed from Festus who was neither
Church nor Church officer, and so Paul appealeth from an inferior civil
judge, to a superior or civil judge, as is clear, Acts 28. 6. And when Festus
had tarried amongst them more then ten days, he went down to Cesarea, and the
Paul appealed from an inferior civil judge to a superior civil and heathen
judge, in a matter of his life, not in a matter of Religion.
next day sitting in the judgment seat, commanded Paul to be brought, verse.
10. And Paul said, I stand at Cesars judgment seat, where I ought to be
judged; he refused, v. 9, 10. to be judged by Festus at Jerusalem, but says,
v. 11. I appeal to Caesar: Now he had reason to appeal from Festus to Caesar, for
the Jews laid many grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not
prove, verse. 7. And it is said verse. 8. That Festus was willing to do the
Jews a pleasure, and so was manifestly a partial Judge; and though the
Sanedrim at Jerusalem could have judged in point of Law, that Paul was a
blasphemer, and so by their Law he ought to die, for so Caiphas and the Priests
and Pharisees dealt with Jesus Christ, yet his appeal from the Sanedrim, 1.
corrupted, and having manifestly declared their bloody intentions against
Paul. 2. From a Sanedrim in its constitution false, and degenered far from what
it ought to be by Gods institution, Deuteronomy. 17. 8, 9, 10. it now usurping civil
business, which belonged not to them; Paul might also lawfully appeal from a
bloody and degenerating Church judicature, acting according to the bloody
lusts of men against an innocent man, to a more unpartiall judge, and yet be no
contemner of the Church; this is nothing against our Thesis, which is, that it
is not lawful to appeal in a constituted Church, from a lawful unmixt Church
Judicature to the civil Magistrate in a matter of life and death. 3. Paul
appealed from the Sanedrim, armed with the unjust and tyrannical power of
Festus, a man willing to please the bloody accusers of Paul, as is clear, v.
9. And Festus willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul and said, Will thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?

3. The cause was not properly a Church business but a crime of bodily death
and sedition; I deny not but in Paul's accusation, profaning of the Temple,
teaching against the Law of Moses was objected to him. Materialiter the enemies
made the cause of Paul a Church business, but formally it was sedition. 1. It
was a business for which the Sanedrim sought Paul's life and blood, for which
they had neither authority nor Law by divine Institution, therefore they sought
the help of Felix, Festus and the Roman Deputies; so Lysias vvrote to Felix,
Act. 23. 29. I perceived Paul to be accused of questions of their law, but to
have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death, or of bonds: Now it is clear
the Roman Deputies thought not any accusation for the Jewish Religion a matter
of death and bonds, and therefore Gallio the Deputy of Achaia, Acts 18. 14.
says to the Jews, if it were a matter of wrong and wicked lewdnes, O ye
Jews, reason were that I should bear with you. 15. But if it be a question of
words and names, and of your Law, look ye to it, for I will be no judge of
such matters; Ergo, to the Romans, all the blasphemies of the Jewish law was
not a matter of wicked lewdness, nor of death: Now the story is clear, they
were seeking Paul's life, and for names and words, the Jews should not reach
Paul, nor move the Romans to put to death a Roman, except they could prove
sedition or treason against him; and Acts 25. Festus says to Agrippa, That the
Priests and Elders desired to have judgment against Paul. 18. But against him
they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed. 19. But had certain
questions against him of their own Superstition, and of one Jesus, who was
dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive: Here it is clear, all are but words,
nothing worthy of death, which the Jews chiefly intended; therefore they
accuse him of treason, as we may collect from Paul's Apology, Acts 25. 8.
Neither against the Law of the Jews, neither against the Temple, nor yet
against Caesar have I offended any thing at all. Therefore Act. 24. Tertullus a
witty man burdeneth Paul with that which might cost him his head, v. 5. For we
have found this man a pestilent fellow, a mover of sedition amongst all the
Jews, throughout all the world, see Acts 21. 38. of all which, though
blasphemy according to the Jewish Law was something, yet sedition to the
Romans, who only now had power of Paul's life, was all and some; and when the
Deputies counted so little of Religion, the Jews knew sedition and treason
against Caesar behooved to do the turn, and Paul, seeing they pursued him for
his life, appealed to Caesar to be judged in that. Now, except the adversaries
prove that Paul referred the resurrection of Jesus, and of the dead, and his
preaching Christ, and the abolishing of sacrifices, the Temple, the Ceremonial
Law, to be judicially determined by Nero as by the head of the Church, they
prove nothing against us: Hence their chief argument is soon answered; in
what cause Paul was accused of the Jews, in that he appealed to Caesar: But he
was accused not for his sedition, but for his Doctrine, Act. 26. 18. Ergo, Paul
appealed to Caesar in the cause of Doctrine, not of sedition: For, 1. The Major
is dubious, for in what cause he was accused of his head, which was the intent
of the Jews in that he appealed, true; but in what cause he was accused, in all
and every Article of the points of his accusation and challenge, I deny that;
for as touching doctrinals, and his being judged by a lawful Church, and
rightly constituted, he appealed neither from the Sanedrim, nor from Festus,
but declined Festus, nor in these did he appeal to Caesar; he only appealed in
all cases, which might concern his head and blood. 2. The assumption is false,
for he was accused of sedition, as is evident from Act. 25. 8. and 24. 5. 3.
Though the Priests and Elders were most corrupt men; yet that they believed,
that Caesar, or bloody Nero his lips should preserve knowledge, and that the Law
should be sought from the mouth of Nero, as the head of the Church, can never
be proved, which must be proved to justify Paul's appeal in the terms of the
adversary.

Obj. But may not Nero accuse Paul, that he dare preach his Jesus Christ in the
Emperors dominions?

Ans. If his dominions be the Christian Churches conquered by his sword, he may
accuse as he conquered, that is he may oppress the consciences of men in
accusing, as he oppressed them in their bodies and liberties in the conquering
of them: But he may not What power a conqueror has to set up a religion in a
conquered nation.
as a conqueror accuse them for their conscience, he may if he conquer those
that worship Satan, cause instruct them in all meekness and lenity: But this
he does by the sword as a Christian ruler, to enlarge the dominions of Christ;
for when ^^ conquereth their bodies, it is not to be thought that he conquereth
their souls, or acquireth any new dominion over their cons^i^nces: But though
he do as a Magistrate command them to be instructed, I doubt if he have a
negative voice in imposing any Religion that he will, though they be heathens,
though some learned Divines say be have a definitive voice, in setting up what
Religion he will or tollerating it; I conceive, though he have a definitive
voice in erecting the only true Religion in his heathenish dominions, when
there be no Ministers of the Gospel there; yet not for any false Religions,
that being of perpetual truth, God never gave authority or power of the sword
to do ill, ad malum non est potestas: what other things Videlius and Vtenbogard
have on the contrary, are answered: Hence Videlius de Episcopat. Constant. p.
77. Vtenbogard. p. 33.
we ask, 1. If the intrinsecall end of judging and censuring Ecclesiastically,
be not the inlightning of the mind, the gaining of souls; and if Nero, or
Christian, or Heathen Magistrates, be appointed for that spiritual end? 2. If
Paul aimed to refer the judging of the Gospel to Nero? 3. If Paul knowing the
Sanedrim sought his blood, not the gaining of his soul, might not appeal to the
Magistrate to save his life? 4. If it was not the Law of natures dictate in
Paul so to do, and not any positive constitution of the Magistrates Headship
over the Church and Gospel? 5. If the Ecclesiastical judicature will swell
without its sphere of activity, to dispose of the life and blood of the Saints;
if then the state of the question be not changed; and if then it be not lawful
to appeal and decline, and provoke to the civil Magistrate?

4. Moreover Paul appealed not to Caesar, in ordine ad censuram au^ pen^m
Ecclesiasticam* in order to a Church censure, as if he thought Caesar should
principally excommunicate and cast him out of the ^ynagogue, or judge him in an
Ecclesiastical way, whether he had done or preached against the Temple, and
Law of Moses or not, which must be proved, if the adversaries will prove a
proper appeal from the Church to the Prince, which is now our question. All
this which is our mind is well explained by our Countryman Ioh. Camero.

verbum, Rex enim cum senatui Ecclesiastico paret, non paret illi obedientia
civili quae Collegium respiciat, sed obedientia Religiosa que deum respiciat.
Sic qui lictori misso a senatu parebat non parebat lictori, sed senatui. Yet it
cannot be denied, but the same Camero ascribes more to the Magistrate then is
due, for there is no reason why he says the Prince obeys the Church
unproperly, more then the people; for it is the same obedience that Prince and
people Camero. prel^ct. in Mat. 16. v. 18. 19. Tu es p^trus. p. 17.
yield, 2. He denies that the Magistrate and Pastors differ in their end and
object, but only in the way and means leading to the end; and in the same does
that learned Divine Dav. Pareus, though both be against the Erastian way: for
they say the Magistrates end and object, is not only peace and the good of the
body, and of the external man, but also of the soul even a supernatural good,
the external salvation of men, because the Kings of Israel and Iud^ls were to
read the book of the Law, and they only did reform Religion: Ans. This does
prove that the Church-teachers and Magistrate differ not in the material
object and end, (of the Jewish Kings I add nothing to what I have answered
before) but in the formal end and object they differ: Its Due right of
Presbyteries. p. 435 436. 437 438. etc.
true, I have said that the intrinsecall end of the Magistrate is a
supernatural good: But, 1. That I speak in opposition to the Author of the
bloody Tenent, to Socinians, and such as exclude the Magistrate from all
meddling with Religion, or using of the sword against Heretics, Apostates, and
Idolaters. 2. That I understand only of the material end, because the Prince
punishing Idolatry, may per accidens, and indirectly promote the salvation of
the Church, by removing the temptations of Heretics from the Church; but ^e
does that, not in order to the conscience of the Idolater, to gain ^is soul,
(for Pastors as Pastors do that) but to make the Church quiet, and peaceable in
her journey to life eternal: but all this is but to act on the external man
by worldly power.

But says Camero, it is not true that the Church must meddle with Camero, 16,
17. 18.
every sin that is scandalous; because for the circumstance it may be so hid,
that the Church cannot judge it, especially in a matter of fact: A Physician
kills a man either of temerity or negligence, there is no question but it is
a great sin; yet the trial of this belongs not to the Church: so the Pastor
may exhort the Magistrate to do his duty, but to give judgment what way the
King should do this, and when he sins in this, belongs to him who
governs the Commonwealth; for this must be true, eredendum est artifici in
sua art, You must believe every man in his own Art and calling, otherwise
great confusion should follow.

Ans. Observe that Camero does liberate the Magistrate from being subject to
the rebukes of Pastors, but by accident; because the sins of Princes are hidden
in the dark obscurity of intricate causes which they judge: But so the sins of
Painters and tradesmen are hid, because judges see not the mysteries of trades.
This is no Argument, but such as will equally prove, that the poisoning of a
Kings son, belongs not to the King and Parliament; for a medicinal and
physical trying, how the Physician kills a man, does properly belong to the
College of Physicians; and if it belong not for this physical reason to the
Church court, because it is not their Art to judge of medicinal potions, no
more shall it belong to the civil judge to try this murder by poison: for as
Pastors as Pastors are not Physicians, and so cannot judge of the fact; so
Kings and civil judges, as such, are not Physicians, and cannot judge for
circumstances of a fact of incest, murder, parricide, and of all sins
acknowledged to belong to both Church and Magistrate, in diverse respects, may
make the fact equally dark to all. 2. It is true Pastors cannot prescribe what
way the Magistrate should judge; but if the Pastors cannot determine in
hypothesie, that this is a fact of unjustice in a judge, and so rebuke, but
credendum artifici in sua art, we must believe the judge in his own Art, he
says this is an art of justice: then Isaiah and Jeremiah should not cry out
against unjust decrees, against crushing and oppressing the poor in the gate;
because the wickedst judges say, all their decrees are just, they defend the
fatherless and widow, and do not crush them, and Pastors cannot rebuke the
sins of unjust judges, but you must believe they do just and right in their
own art; yea, many villainies and scandals are carried so mysteriously, and in
the clouds, that we must believe the sinner in his own art and trade of
sinning, and believe the harlot, who wipeth her mouth and says, I have not
sinned. For the practice of Constantine the Great, in the cause of Donatus

Quest. 23.
Whether the subjecting of the Magistrates to the Church and Pastors, be any
papal Tyranny; and whether we differ not more from Papists in this, then our
adversaries? The Magistrate not the Vicar of the mediator Christ: The
Testimonies of some learned Divines on the contrary answered.

IT is most unjustly imputed to us, that we lay a Law upon the To lay bands on
the conscience of the Prince to tie him to blind obedience, Popish, not our
Doctrine. Platina. in Bonifac. 3. Baronius an. 602. n. 18. Baronius. an. 606.

conscience of the Magistrates, that they are bound to assist with their power,
the decrees of the Church; taking cognizance only of the fact of the Church,
not inquiring into the Nature of the thing.

This Doctrine we disclaim, as Popish and Antichristian: It has its rise from
Bonifacius the III. who obtained from Phocas a bloody tyrant, who murdered
Mauritius and his Children, as Baronius confesses: and yet he says of this
murderer optimortum imperatorum vestigia sequutus, he made an Edict that the
Bishop of Constantinople should not be called Oecumenick nor universal Bishop;
but that this should be given only to the Bishop of Rome: So Baronius yields,
this tyranny was enlarged by Hildebrande, named Gregorius the seventh, a
monster of tyrannical wickedness, and yet by Papists, he is sanctitate et
miraculis clarus, Baronius extolleth him, these and others invaded both the
swords: Bishops would be civil judges, and trample first upon the neck, then
upon the consciences of Emperors, and make Kings the horns of the beast, and
seclude them from all Church businesses, except that with blind obedience,
having given their power to the beast, as slaves they must execute the decrees
of the Church. Paul the III. the confirmer of the order of Jesuits, who

with Church business: They write that Magistrates do not see in Church
matters with their own eyes, but with Bishops eyes, and that they must obey
without examining the decrees of Councels; and this they write of all subject
to the Church, Toletus in Instruct Sacerd^t. l. 4. c. 3. Si Rusticus circa

over the Church, giving to the King all the same power in causes
Ecclesiastic, that the Pope usurped. 2. They make the King a mixed person, to
exercise spiritual jurisdiction, to ordain Bishops, and deprive them; and Mr.
Prinne calls the opinion of those who deny Ecclesiastical jurisdiction,
legislative (a high word proper to God only) coercive power of Christian
Emperors, Kings, Magistrates, Parliaments, in all matters of Religion, (what,
in fundamental Articles of salvation?) Church Government, Discipline,
Ceremonies, etc. Anti-monarchicall, Anti-parliamentarie, Anarchicall, as holden
by Papists, Prelates, Anabaptists, Arminians, Socinians, etc. Its that which
Arminians objects to us, and calls the soul, heart, and form of papal
tyranny.

But that the Magistrate is not obliged to execute the decrees of the Church,
without further examination; whither they be right or wrong, as Papists teach
that the Magistrate is to execute the decrees of their Popish councels with
blind obedience, and submit his faith to them; because he is a layman, and may
not dare to examine, whether the Church does err, or not, is clear; 1. Because
if in hearing the word, all should follow the example of the men of Berea, not
relying on the Testimony of Paul or any preacher; try, whether th^^ which
concerns their conscience and faith, be agreeable to the Scriptures or no,
and accordingly receive or reject; so in all things of Discipline, the
Magistrate is to try by the word, whether he ought to add his sanction to
these decrees, which the Church gives out for edification, and whether he
should draw the sword against such a one as a heretic, and a perverter of
souls: But the former is true, the Magistrates practice in adding his civil
sanction, and in punishing herericks concerns his conscience, knowing that he
must do it in faith, as he does all his moral actions; Ergo, the Magistrate
must examine what he practices in his office, according to the word, and must
not take it upon the mere authority of the Church; else his faith in these
moral acts of his office should be resolved ultimate on the authority of the
Church, not on the word of God, which no doubt is Popery; for so the warrant of
the Magistrates conscience, should not be, Thus says the Lord, but Thus says
the Church in their decrees. 2. The Magistrate and all men have a command to
try all things; Ergo, to try the decrees of the Church, and to retain what is
good, 1 These. 5. 21. To try the spirits even of the Church, in their decrees, 1 John 3. 1. 3. We behooved to lay down this Popish ground, that 1. The Church
cannot err in their decrees. 2. Its against Scripture and reason, that
Magistrates, and by the like reason, all others should obey the decrees of the
Church with a blind faith, without inquiring in the warrants and grounds of
their decrees, which is as good Popery, as, Magistrates and all men are to
believe as the Church believes with an implicit faith, so ignorance shall be
the mother of Devotion; who ever impute this to us who have suffered for
nonconformity, and upon this ground that Synods can err, refused the
Ceremonies, are to consult with their own conscience whether this be not to
make us appear disloyal and odious to Magistracy in that which we never
thought, ^ar less to teach and profess it to the world. 4. Their chief
reason is, the Magistrate by our doctrine, by his office, is obliged, 1. To
follow the judgment of the Church, and in that he is a servant or inslaved,
Qui enim judicia aliorum sequi tenetur, is non regit, sed regitur, adeoque
Remonstr. in apolog.
servus est, and mancipium brutum eorum, quorum judicium sequi obligatur, and
the Magistrate (say they) as such, is neither to judge nor try what the Church
decrees, but as a Burrio, or Hangman to execute that which the Church has
decreed. But 1. I put it in form, and retort it thus, They are servants and
slaves who are obliged not to despise, but to hear and obey, and so to follow
the judgment of the Prophets, the faithful Pastors of Christ, preaching the
Word of God soundly and Orthodoxly.

But not only Magistrates, but all within the visible Church are obliged, not
to despise, but to hear and obey, and so to follow the judgment of the
Prophets, the faithful Pastors of Christ preaching the Word of God soundly and
Orthodoxely; Ergo, Magistrates and all within the visible Church are slaves and
servants.

But the conclusion is absurd; Ergo, some of the premises, but the Assumption
is the word of God, Judah was carried captive, because they would not hear the
Prophets rising early in the morning and speaking to them: Also in the New
Testament, this is true to the second coming of Christ, He that hears you,
hears me, he that despises you, despises me. And this, He that will not
obey the servant of the supreme Magistrate, in that wherein he is a servant,
and holds forth the Lawful commands of the supreme Magistrate, he will not
obey the supreme Magistrate: The Major proposition is the adversaries, the
assumption is express Scripture; let them see then to the conclusion. 2. When
the adversary shall answer this argument with equal strength made against
preaching and hearing the word, they will answer their own argument made
against Church Government. 3. This argument is made against Synods Popish, that
cannot err* as our Protestant Divines object; and therefore the adversary is
Popish here, not we: Thus they are servants and slaves who are obliged to
follow the judgment of Councels absolutely, without limitation; and because
they say it, whether they warrant their decrees by the word of God, or not,
that is a true Major proposition: But now the assumption is most false, for
neither Magistrates nor any other, are to follow the judgment of the Church
absolutely without limitation, and because they say it. The other part is, they
are servants and slaves, who are to follow the judgment of the Church and
Councels, with a reserve, and a condition, and limitation, in so far as they
agree with the word; now the Major is false.

2. He that is obliged to follow the judgment of another, does not rule, but
is ruled, true, in that in which he follows the judgment of another; the
Magistrate in so far as in matters of Religion, that concerns his conscience,
faith, and practice, he follows Pastors; he is not a ruler formally to those
whose judgment he is obliged to follow: But in civil matters he may be, and
is a ruler to those same; for we answer to Papists who by this same argument
would prove, that Churchmen are not subject to the Magistrate, nor to civil
Laws: He that is a sheep, is not to rule and So Stapleton, Bellarmine and other
Papists argue.
command his shepherd; but the Magistrate is a sheep and a member of the
Church, and Pastors and Doctors are shepherds: We answer, in diverse
considerations a Magistrate as a Magistrate in civil things, is not ruled by
Pastors and Doctors, but he is to rule them: But a Magistrate as a member of
the Church, as a Christian in things that concerns his conscience, is a sheep
and to be ruled, not a ruler to Pastors and Doctors, and so here; and
therefore, non concluditur quod est (...).

3. The adversaries are to answer this also; for if Pastors and Doctors be as
such, but servants under the Magistrate; and if he have that same
Architectonica potestas, that same supremacy and headship in Ecclesiastical
matters, as in civil matters, to command alike in both by the same power:
Then, 1. The Pastors and Doctors are obliged to follow his judgment, without
appeal or examination, and they are servants and slaves, and ruled, and not
(...) not over the Magistrates as Christians, neither over the people in the
Lord. 2. The Elders as Elders, are not to examine what the Magistrates as
Magistrates command in Ecclesiastical matters or in Religion, they may
possibly not as Elders but as as Christians, judge with the judgment of
discretion, as all other Christians may do; For Videlius, Erastus, and other
Adversaries say, the Magistrate may not command what he pleases; for in Church
matters he may command but according to the rule of the word, and in civil
matters according to equity, justice, and prudence. True: But, 1. The
Magistrate as supreme head of the Church, is by office, to judge what
government of the Church is most agreeable to the word, what is sinful,
Antichristian, and tyrannical; and the Magistrates lips in thus judging, as he
is a Magistrate, and not the Pastors are to preserve knowledge; and both
Pastors as Pastors, and the people as members of the Church, and as they may
worship and serve God in this government, or may sin, are to seek the Law at
the Magistrates mouth, and directions for their conscience from him, as from a
Magistrate, and not as from a Christian, not from Pastors as Pastors that
handle the Law. And if the government as a way of serving God, may be
prescribed and held forth to the consciences of all by the Magistrate as the
Magistrate; by the same reason all the ways of God, in which the Church of
Ephesus, Pergamus, Thyatira, may so approve themselves to Christ, and as he is
to walk in the midst of the Golden Candlesticks, and as a Magistrate, he is to
forbid such sins in Government, as may procure the removing of the Candlestick;
and why may he not by the same reason, hold forth to their conscience all the
other parts of the Gospel? If any say, who can deny but the Magistrate as the
Magistrate may command that which is obedience to Christ, and reward it, and
forbid sin and punish it?

Ans. But the Magistrate as such, forbids not sin as sin, for The Magistrate
as a Magistrate cannot forbid sin as sin.
then as a Magistrate he should forbid sin under the punishment of eternal
wrath, which he cannot do as a Magistrate, he only can forbid sin under the
pain of his temporary punishment, which he can inflict, and as it disturbes
societies, and incorporations.

Obj. The Magistrate as the Magistrate shall not serve Christ as Mediator, if
he do not command the dispensing of Word and Sacraments, as they are
spiritual means leading us to a supernatural end, and if he forbid not
Idolatry and blasphemy against Christ as they are sins, and Gospel sins done
against Christ, as Mediator.

Ans. I utterly deny this consequence: For 1. the Magistrate The Magistrate as
the Magistrate promoteth Christ's mediatory Kingdom materially, not directly and
formally.
may serve Christ as Christ, and promote and advance the Kingdom of Jesus
Christ as Mediator, when he contributes his power to those things that
materially conduce to a supernatural end, though he do not contribute any
thing that formally conduces to such an end. 2. So you may say a Christian
Husband as a Husband; a godly Physician, as a Physician, a Printer who printeth
the Bible, do nothing serviceable to Christ as Christ, and in promoting Christ's
Mediatory Kingdom, when the one begets children, that being borne in the
visible Church are made heirs of the Kingdom of Christ; and the other when by
his Art and skill he preserves the life of a godly and zealous Preacher: The
third, when by his Art he publishes in print the Testament of Christ; the
Physician does somewhat as a Physician that is serviceable to Christ as
Mediator, yet (I hope) it is no Ecclesiastical business to restore to health
a godly Minister; nor to beget a child who is made an heir of Grace, nor to
print the Bible; so a Philosopher as a Philosopher does convince one that
worshippeth bread, that the man leaves his error, and this is materially
service to Christ, and a promoting of Christ's Mediatory Kingdom; but neither
Husband, Physician, Printer or Philosopher, are in these acts, the Vicars and
Deputies of Jesus Christ, as the Magistrate is holden to be by the Adversary:
Nor 2. do they as Ecclesiastical persons formally advance the kingdom of
Christ as do the preachers of the Gospel, far less more principally do they
advance Christ's Kingdom, as the Magistrate is supposed to do. Nor 3. has their
thus promoting of Christ's Kingdom any influence upon the conscience as the
Magistrate must have, if he forbid sin as sin; now the Magistrate as such, does
nothing to promote formally the mediatory Kingdom of Christ, for he may do,
and does all he does as a Magistrate; yea suppose he were a Turk set over*
Christians as their Magistrate granting that Christ was a true Prophet, yet may
he as a Magistrate, punish those who shall teach that Christ was a false
Prophet and an impostor, and though his Magistraticall acts be serviceable to
Christ materially, yet not formally. 1. Because this Magistrate denies Christ
to be the Savior of the world, and yet as a Magistrate he justly punishes the
man that blasphemo^sly calls Christ a deceiver, and an impostor. 2. Because
as a Magistrate he believes him not to be God, and so ex intention operantis,
he punishes him not for a wrong done to Christ as Christ, The Magistrate as
such not the Vicar of the Mediator Christ. The adversaries in the doctrine of
the Magistrate Popish, not we at all. Andreas Rivetus Jesuit. Vapul. in

and as the Savior of mankind, but as a wrong done to the common wealth, and
as a disturber of the peace thereof; Hence these Propositions touching the
Magistrates relation to the Mediator Christ and his Church.

Propos. 1. The Magistrate as a Magistrate is not the Vicar nor Deputy of
Jesus Christ as Mediator; 1. Because this is the heart and soul of Popery, that
the Papists teach that Christ as Mediator has left a temporal, an earthly and
visible Monarch as his Vicar on earth. Now that learned and singular ornament
of the Protestant Churches, Andreas Rivetus has well said, Christ has
instituted neither Kings nor Princes in the Church as his successors, nor any
Vicars with a domination, but only Ministers and Servants, who are to
discharge their Embassage, in the Name of the only Prince Christ; for an
Embassage cannot institute other Ambassadors, either Kings or Princes, but
only Ministers, who do serve, not reign in the Kingdom of Christ, he himself
only reigns; the Servants of this great King promote the Kingdom of their
Prince, nor do they ever usurp the royal power. Yea, all the arguments of
Protestants that are brought to prove that the Pope, a Bishop, and a Church
man* because he is a Bishop and a Steward in the Church, and in Christ's
spiritual Kingdom that is not of this world, cannot be an earthly Prince and
Monarch having power either directly or indirectly in ordine ad spiritualia, to
dispose of Kingdoms and crowns, and enthrone and dethrone Kings, do also
prove that the King cannot be head of the Church, nor the Magistrate Cardinal

an Officer of the Church. Do not Protestant Divines condemn that blasphemous
speech of Cardinal Bertrandus, that Christ who was a temporal Lord on earth,
should not seem a discreet and wise Prince, if he had not left a Temporal
Vicar behind him in the Church, and that of Armacanus to be false; that Christ
by birth was the true King of Judea, and so a Temporary Prince, hence (say
they) there should be a temporary Prince, and an earthly Monarch, the successor
of Christ as King and Mediator. This Becanus the Jesuit makes a special
ground of the Popes Headship of the Church, and for this Suarez disputes; yea,
the Jesuit Aegid. Conninck says, It is the common and received opi^^^n of all
the (Romish) Doctors, that Christ as man has a true Kingly power, and a direct
dominion over all the Kingdoms of the world, to give them laws, and to
exercise all Kingly power over them, though de facto he abstained from it; and
is not upon this pillar builded the Popes Supremacy? and that which Augustinus
de Ancona says, Idem esse dominium dei and Pap^, it is the same dominion which
God and the Pope has, because it is the same jurisdiction of the Ambassador,
and of the Lord who sent him? I deny not, but many Papists give to Christ an
indirect Kingly power, and to the Pope they give the same indirect power in
ordine ad spiritualia, as Vasquez, and Pet. Waldingus and others; but this we
say; if Jesus Christ forbid a preacher of the Gospel remaining a preacher to
be a civil Magistrate or temporal Lord, as he does both by precept and and
practice, Luke 22. 24, 25, 26. and 12. 13, 14. Ioh. 18, 36. and 6, 15. then
upon the same ground he must forbid the civil Magistrate to be a Church
Governor, as if God should forbid a Physician to be a Painter, (because the
two callings cannot lawfully consist in the person of one man) he should also
forbid a Painter to be Pastors are made inferior Magistrates by the
adversaries in their whole Ministry.
a Physician; then the Arguments against a Monarchy and Magistraticall power in
the Bishop of Rome, must fight against any Ecclesiastical power in a
Magistrate, if then the Pastors do as Pastors, rebuke, exhort, excommunicate,
and censure, as directly subordinate to the Magistrate, then Pastors as Pastors
discharge their office as inferior and under Magistrates, and so they partake
in so far of a temporal dominion, being direct instruments under Temporal
Lords; and if the Magistrate as the Magistrate do command them to dispense
Word, and Sacraments and discipline, and make and unmake Pastors, and regulate
and limit them, and make Laws to them, then the Magistrate as the Magistrate
does partake of an Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and both are forbidden by
Christ in the places cited. 2. If the Magistrate be the only supreme Church
Governor under Christ, the government of the Church must be a visible
Monarchy, and the Magistrate must have both the Swords, Temporal and
Spiritual, and Christ's Kingdom must be of this world, and the weapons thereof
carnal to fight for Christ, and the supreme Churchofficer as such must bear
the Sword, be a valiant man of war by office, and Christ's Kingdom must be
not of this world, and the weapons thereof not carnal, but spiritual, Joh.
18. 36. 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5. and the supreme Church Officer must be no striker, no
fighter, no man of war, no sword bearer by office, which are contradictory. 3.
We prove the Pope to be no Vicar of Christ, because we read not in the Word of
any such Vicar, nor do we read any thing of a supreme Church Officer, who is
the Vicar of Christ. 4. No spiritual Ambassador as such, can substitute other
Ambassadors with Majority of power, that he has in his Name to dispense Word,
Sacraments; and Discipline; nor can one great Ministerial Church-head create
lesser Ministerial Church-heads, such as Justices, Majors, Sheriffs,
Bailiffes, Constables, no more then the High Priest could substitute in his
place other little High Priests, if he were sick and absent, to go into the
Holy of Holiest with blood once a year, no more then the Apostle Paul
immediately called of God can substitute other lesser Apostles immediately
called of God to act as lesser Apostles, but limited by the higher, in the
exercise of power; nor can these lesser Apostles create other Apostles yet
lesser, and these in a subalternation yet lesser, while you come as low as a
Constable, as the King does send lesser Kings endued in part with his Royalty
or Judges under him, and those Judges may appoint other Judges under them; and
because the whole visible Catholic Church has an external visible policy, if
Oecumenick councels have any warrant in the word, then ought Christ to have
instituted one civil Emperor over all the Churches on earth, to conveen
Oecumenick Synods, to preside in them, to limit and regulate them, to make
Laws to all the world; and that this is not, it falls out through man's
corruption, but it ought to be according to divine institution, no less then
every single Magistrate is by institution the head of every particular Church,
endued as our adversary say with that supreme power under Christ the mediator,
that they call Potestas Architectonica, the headship of the Church.

Proposi. 2. The Magistrate as such is not a Vicar of Christ's mediatory The
Magistrate as such not the vicar of the mediatory kingdom.
Kingdom, 1. Because then as the Magistrates are called Gods (...) in
Scripture, Exodus 21. 6. Psalm. 82. 1 Ioh. 10. 34, 35. so the Magistrates should
be called little Mediators, or submediators, between God and man; little Kings
of the Church, little Priests, little Prophets of the Church: for God gives
his name to Magistrates, because he communicates also to them some of his
Majesty and power; now what mediatory, what Princely, Priestly, o^ Prophetical
power has Christ communicated to Magistrates as Magistrates: Erastus says,
they may dispense word and Sacraments, Brotherly re-examination, page 20.
if they had leisure: But if they be by office, little mediators, and Pastors
under Christ, they should take leisure; for every Magistrate ought to say, woe
be unto me if I preach not: And Master Coleman says, that Christian Magistracy
is an Ecclesiastical administration; Christian Magistracy no Ecclesiastical
administration.
he must speak of Christian Magistracy formally, as Christian Magistracy,
otherwise a Christian Tentmaker, a believing fisher was an Apostle; if he mean
that Christian Magistracy is a Church officer formally, he might say, it is a
Mediatory office, and a Princely and Kingly office under Christ, to give
repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins instrumentally; would Master
Coleman teach us how the Magistrates sword opens the eyes of the blind,
converteth men from the power of Satan to God, begets men through the
Gospel to Christ, as Pastors do; and that formally as Magistrates, we should
thank him. 2. Christian Magistracy, if it be a Church or Ecclesiastical
administration, then is it formally so either as Magistracy, or as Christian;
not as Magistracy, for then all Heathen Magistrates must formally, ho^ ipso,
that they be Magistrates, be Ecclesiastical persons: so Nero when Rome makes
him Emperor, they make him formally a Church Officer, and invest him with
power to dispense Word and Sacraments, and Discipline, if he might find leisure
for killing of men, and such business, so to do; for quod convenit (...)
convenit (...) where does the Old or New Testament hold forth such an office
given by Christ, as a fruit of his ascension to heaven? Where do the Apostles
who show us the duty of Magistrates, Fathers, Masters, Pastors, Teachers,
Rulers, Deacons, Husbands, insinuate any such office? If as Christian,
Christian Magistracy be an Ecclesiastical office and administration:
Christianity, 1. Is common to the Magistrate with all other professors,
Painters, Merchants, Seamen, Lawyers, Musicians; and no more can Christianity
make a heathen formally a Church Officer, then it can make a Painter formally a
Church Officer? can faith in Christ, and professing thereof make any to be
formally Church Officers? then must all be Church Officers that are Members of
the Church, for posita causa formali ponitur effectus formali^: Now Master
Coleman says, The heathen Magistrate as a Magistrate is an Ecclesiastical
administration; because (says he) he Mr. Coleman re-examination, page 1^.
should, and ought to manage his power for Christ; as the heathen and uttermost
parts of the earth are given for Christ's possession and inheritance, and Christ
has given no liberty to a great part of the world, to remain infidels and
enemies to him and his Government: I suppose Christ has all Nations given to
him, and all Nations ought to receive Christ, though as yet actually they do
not; God and Nature has made Magistrates, and these Magistrates thus made, God
has given to Christ: But, 1. The title of Christian added to Magistracy, by
this is superfluous, and put in only ad faciendum populum, for Christianity
makes no man formally a Magistrate by M. Colemans way; yet says he page 17. a
Christian Magistrate as a Christian Magistrate, is a Governor in the Church:
he should say by his way, a Magistrate Christian as a Magistrate, is a
Governor not only in the Church, but a Governor of the Church.

Arg. 2. If the Magistrate as the Magistrate be the Vicar and deputy of Christ's
mediatory kingdom, then all and every Magistrate as Magistrate by his office,
is obliged under the pain of Gods wrath, to command that the Gospel be
preached, and that men believe and obey Christ as mediator, in all his
dominions; that so he may manage his office for Christ: But the latter is
utterly false, and contrary Heathen Magistrates as such are not obliged to
promote Christ's mediatory kingdom.
to the Gospel; Ergo, so is the former. The Major is undeniable, all service
that Magistrates by office do, they sin before God, if they do it not; and so
must be obliged under the pain of sin, and Gods wrath to do it: And therefore
are obliged to command that the Gospel be preached, and that men believe and
obey Christ, if by office they be the Vicars and deputies of the mediatory
Kingdom. I prove the assumption, These Magistrates amongst the Americans and
other Heathen, who never by any rumor heard of Jesus Christ, are essentially
and formally Magistrates: But neither are they obliged to command that the
Gospel be preached, nor their people they are over, obliged to believe and obey
Christ as mediator; because only those to whom Christ and the Gospel comes,
can be guilty of not receiving Christ the mediator, and of not promoting the
mediatory Kingdom: Such Magistrates are obliged only with their sword to
glorify God the creator, and to punish sins against the Law of Nature, nor are
they guilty for not punishing the not receiving of the Gospel, or for sins
against the mediator, of whom they never heard; for this is invincible and
insuperable ignorance, and can make no man guilty, who never heard nor could
hear of the Gospel, according to that, Ioh. 15. 22. If I had not come and
spoken to them, they should not have had sin, but now they have no cloak for
their sin, Romans 2. 12. For as many as have sinned without Law, shall also
perish without Law, and as many as have sinned in the Law, shall be judged by
the Law; Ergo, they that never heard of the Gospel or the mediator, cannot
perish, nor be judged for refusing the Gospel; and it were strange, if
Magistrates were invincibly ignorant of their office, which is to set up the
mediator Christ and his Church and visible Kingdom, if yet they never heard,
nor ever could hear of the Word of the Kingdom; for then to do and perform the
duties of their office, should not only morally, but invincibly and physically
be impossible, and so they should not be obliged to do the duties of their
office.

Obj. 1. When the Heathen Magistrate is converted to the faith, and becomes a
Christian Magistrate, he is obliged by his office as a Magistrate, to command
his people to honor and receive the Lord Jesus, and the Ministry of
reconciliation, and to punish such as blasphemeth the mediator Jesus Christ,
such as Arrians, Antitrinitarians, and others; Ergo, that official obligation
lay on him before as a Magistrate: for you say that the heathen Magistrate
turning Christian, acquireth no new Magistraticall power by turning Christian,
which he had not before while he was a heathen Magistrate; only Christianity
makes him use the official power of a Magistrate, which he had before, while
he was a heathen ignorant of Christ, now for the honor of the mediator Christ,
and the promoting of his mediatory Kingdom.

Ans. 1. The Antecedent is denied, for when the heathen Magistrate is converted
to the Christian faith, he is not obliged by his office, as a Magistrate to
command his people (whom we suppose now to be hearers of the Gospel, and
possibly converted also) to believe and prosesse Christ, nor is he obliged as a
Magistrate to promote the mediatory Kingdom of Christ, as his mediatory and
spiritual Kingdom (he or his sword have nothing to do with spirits or
consciences as they are such, nor with the subjects of a spiritual Kingdom)
nor can he punish blasphemers of Christ as such: nay, nor can he punish such as
sin against God the creator, as they sin against God the Creator, by virtue of
his office of a Magistrate, for so formally he commands obedience to Christ
mediator, or to God creator, and punishes sins and blasphemies against the
mediator, or against God the creator only as such obedience and such
blasphemies, may promote the external safety, prosperity, and peace of the
civil society, whereof he is head, or may dissolve the sinnues and nerves of
that society. What he does to uphold that society which is a part of Christ's
redeemed Kingdom, ^e does it as a Magistrate in a far other Notion then the
Pastors and reachers, who by office as spiritual watchmen, are to promote
Christ's mediatory Kingdom, as such a spiritual incorporation professing union
with Christ the head of the body the Church.

Obj. 2. But yet it will follow that the heathen Magistrate remaining heathen,
is invincibly ignorant of his office; for in so far as he remains a heathen,
he cannot promote the mediatory Kingdom of Christ in any Notion; nay, not so
much as it is a mean conducing to the external safety and peace of that civil
society, whereof he i^ head; Ergo, he must, while he remains an heathen, and
never by rumor hears of the Gospel, be by office a promoter of Christ's
Kingdom, and by office a punisher with the sword, of all such as blasphem the
mediator Christ, though through his own sinful ignorance he cannot put forth
in acts or exercise the very official and Magistraticall power, which he has
by office, and actu primo, while he remains an heathen Magistrate.

Ans. 1. It follows not that the heathen Magistrate, being ignorant (while he
remains in that state) of some acts, which would conduce to the peace and
external safety of the State, if the state were Christian, that he is
invincibly ignorant of his office; to be unable to exercise some acts of an
office not consistent with an heathenish state, can never argue invincible
ignorance of the office. 2. The consequence is naught, that because he is
ignorant of some acts, and cannot exercise them; that therefore the heathen
Magistrate remaining heathen, is by office, and actu primo, an officer and
vicegerent of Christ's mediatory Kingdom: for at no time, and in no state, has
the Magistrates sword any influence in the mediatory Kingdom at all, but in so
far as the sword may procure external peace to the society of that Kingdom as
they are a civil body, which peace he might by office procure by other means
then by commanding the Gospel to be preached, or by punishing such as blaspheme
Christ: for though the material object of the Magistrates sword be the
spiritual Kingdom of Christ, yet the formal object is the natural and civil
peace of this Kingdom as a civil society, for to promote spiritual means,
and to punish spiritual sins, such as heresy and blaspheming of Christ, do
often conduce very much for civil peace. 3. It is false that the heathen
Magistrate is unable to exercise his magistraticall power for the mediator
Christ through his own sinful ignorance, his not knowing Christ of whom he
never heard, is not any sin at all, nor is he obliged to know or believe in
him, of whom he never heard, Romans 10. 14.

Arg. 3. Every Magistrate is (...) an humane Ordinance, Magistracy from the Law
of nations.
1 Pet. 2. 13. and is appointed by God the creator, and by a rational Nature,
yea says Mr. Coleman, God and Nature made Magistrates, he must mean God the
Creator and Nature, but I Suarez to. 1. de legi l. 5. c. 3. qui dat formam, dat

hope God as creator, and Nature made not the Magistrate the head of the
Church, the Vicar of the Mediator Christ, this must have its rise from a higher
fountain then Nature; Ecclesiastical Offices tend to a supernatural end,
Magistracy and humane Laws (says Suarez) is from Nature, and the Law says, de
jure gentium est omnis principatus. That excellent and learned Lawyer, Ferd.
Vasquius says, That all Princedome has its rise from the secondary Law of
Nature, to wit, a jure gentium, from the Law of Nations: Hence Kings, Princes,
Parliaments, Judges, Lord justices, Majors, Sheriffs, Constables, etc. in
their root are natural, but in particulars, Rulers are from the prudence of
humane societies, there is a higher institution for Church* officers, Ephesians. 4.
11. they have not their rise from Nature, and therefore that Celebrious and
renowned Antiquarie, D. Salmasius in that learned work of his, De primatu papae
condemns the dignity and jurisdiction of Patriarchs above Metropolitans, as
flowing from the writs of Princes, and Synodical constitutions of Fathers, not
from any Divine Institution, the highest was as Theodoret says, (...)* Now God
as creator and Nature does not, sure Nature cannot appoint a Vicar of the
Mediator Christ, for if the Magistrate be an Ecclesiastical administration,
then it must be an office intrinsecally supernatural, and intrinsecally and
directly tending to a supernatural end; now the Papists for shame do build
their head of the Church upon a divine institution, and on Christ's words, Thou
art Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and I will give to thee the
keys of the Kingdom of heaven; Christ never said any such thing to a
Magistrate; and if the Magistrate be an Ecclesiastical administration, and the
head of the Church, and the Vicar of Christ as Mediator, he must have more then
this, and the keys of the Kingdom of God must be given to him above Peter and
all the Apostles, for all Church Officers act their part as such, a and sub
Magistratu, from and under the Magistrate, as his Vicars, so as the Magistrate
in America who lived and died never hearing of the Gospel, nor of his Lord
Mediator, is yet by office the Vicar of the Mediator, and obliged as a
Magistrate though a mere heathen to believe in him of whom he never heard, if
the adversary say right, which is unpossible, Romans 10. 14. But says Mr.
Coleman, If Christ be rightful King of the whole earth, where did Christ grant
a liberty to a great part of the world, to remain Infidels and enemies to him
and his Government?

Arg. 4. In Answer to which, I draw a fourth Argument; All the Heathen
Magistrates who never heard of the Mediator Christ and the Gospel, cannot by
office be the Deputies and Vicars of the mediatory Kingdom, for they are not
the professed subjects of The Adversaries must teach universal Redemption.
Christ as Mediator, nor given to him as his possession and inheritance,
neither actually, nor in Gods decree; for thousands of them lived and died
without Christ or any obligation to believe in, or serve the Lord Jesus as
Mediator, for if Christ be not their rightful King as Mediator, nor their King
at all as Mediator, they cannot be his subjects as Mediator, far less can they
be his Deputies and Vicars by office of his Kingdom; but Christ is not King as
Mediator in any sort or title of such as are Heathen Magistrates, for as
Mediator he is neither King, titulo and jure acquisitionis, nor efficaci
applicatione, neither merito, nor efficacia, he neither gave a price as
Mediator to buy them, because the adversaries then must say, that Christ is so
King of the whole earth, as he has died for all and every one of mankind: nor
are they his subjects so much as in the profession of the word of his Kingdom,
for they never heard it; if the Adversaries can say that Christ died for all
and every one of mankind, and so for these Heathen Kings, I can refute this
Article of Arminianisme; and though Christ had died for them, yet are they not
subjects in so much as in profession, and so in no capacity nor obligation to
serve with their sword, Christ as Mediator, for they are not in that state
obliged to believe in him, nor to know him as Mediator; how then are they
obliged by office to serve him as Mediator, except he had revealed himself to
them in the Gospel? Hence I need not prove that Christ is their King by
efficacious applying of the merits of his death to them, nor can any say this
Argument may prove that Pastors by office are the Ambassadors of Christ,
because they are not all the subjects of Christ given to him as Mediator,
either in the decree of Election, nor actually redeemed; for many Pastors who
are by office the Ambassadors of Christ as Mediator, are Reprobates, as was
Judas and others; for the Argument is not drawn from any saving claim that
heathen Princes who never heard of Christ has to Christ, but it is drawn from
no claim at all, no not so much as in profession; now this claim in profession
all Pastors have, else they cannot be Pastors.

It is doubtsome that Master Coloman says, and not to a purpose, That Christ
grants not a liberty to the greatest part of the world, to remain infidels
and enemies to him and his Government: For thus he gives them a liberty
negative, so as they are not obliged to believe a Gospel that they never heard,
nor is their negative infidelity a sin, for which they are condemned: they are
condemned, Because they glorify not the Creator as God, Romans 1. 21. And do not
the things of the Law, that are written in their hearts, Romans 2. 12. 14. Mat.
25. 42, 43, 44. And in this sense God gives to them liberty to remain
infidels, but he gives them not liberty positively to remain infidels and
enemies to Christ, that is, he wills not voluntate signi; that they should
live in a sinful course of unrenewed nature; but they are not positively
enemies to Christ and to his Government, who never by the least rumor heard of
Christ or his Kingdom or Government: Hence all our Divines say, that privative
unbelief of those that hear the Gospel, does condemn, but not the negative
unbelief of those who never heard the Gospel: Thus the adversaries must say,
except they with Arminians, and especically with Moses Amyrald teach, That
there be two ways of preaching Christ, and two sorts of faiths in Christ, one
of those that hear the Gospel, and another of those who are to believe in
Christ, though they never hear of, or know any letter of the Gospel, who yet by
the book of creation and providence are obliged to believe in Christ, which
were an irrational obligation, Romans 10. 14.

Arg. 5. All power mediatory in Heaven and in earth, that is given to Jesus
Christ as Mediator, is all spiritual, all Ecclesiastical power; and therefore
Christ upon this receipt of all power, Mat. 28. 18. draws a conclusion, v.
19. (...), etc. Go^ye therefore and teach all Nations, etc. but a Kingly power
of this world by carnal weapons, and by sword to fight, is not given to Christ
mediator; for he denies expressly, Ioh. 18. 36. that he has such a Kingdom as
Mediator, or that he was instructed with the sword as Mediator, Luke 12. 13.
Now as God and Creator of the world, Christ could not deny but he had a Kingdom
worldly, and that he has a regnum potentiae, an universal Kingdom of power,
as Lord of Hoasts; to dispose of all the Kingdoms of the world, and to rule
amongst the children of men, and to rule over the children of men, and to give
them to whomsoever he will, Dan. 4. 25. and 8. 18. ^er. 27. v. 6, 7, 8, 9.
Psalm. 24. 1. Psalm. 50. v. 12. Nor is this Kingdom and Power given to Christ,
nor is he made Prince and a King as God; but as Mediator to give repentance to
the House of Israel, and forgiveness of sins, Act. 5. 31. I grant it is said,
Phil. 2. 9. God has highly exalted Christ, and given him a name above every
name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and
of things in earth, and things under the earth. What? does not this (say the
adversaries) comprehend a royal power given to Christ? and has not Christ
from this power to substitute Magistrates in his place, as his vicars under
him, and as little mediators? I answer, it does in no sort follow: for that is
a spiritual power, as is clear, Romans 14. v. 9. For to this end Christ both
died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of dead and living, v.
11. For it is written, as I live says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,
and every tongue Cl. Salmasius de primatri pape, 1. Part. in apparatu, p. 148.
149. nullum jus in corpora ^abuernat ut Magistratus civiles, sad animarum curam
gerebant ut very pastores docere, pascere munera fuere spiritualia long

shall confess God: So it is clearly expounded of Christ's exalting at the
right hand of God, Act. 5. 31. for spiritual and supernatural ends, I grant
as Mediator and King he breaks his enemies, Devils, and men, Psalm. 2. 9. With
a rod of iron, and dasheth them in pieces like a potters vessel, and makes his
enemies his footstool, Psalm. 110. 1. But that is no carnal power, such as
earthly Kings uses, it is a spiritual power, for the reason is given, ver. 2.
The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Sion: By which v. 5. as a
great Anti-royalist, He strikes through Kings in the day of his wrath: Now
Christ as Mediator sends not out Kings and Princes to conquer souls to him
with their sword: Renowned Salmasius says, When Christ sent his Apostles first
to preach the Gospel, and to lay the foundation of the Christian Church, did he
send out with them lictors, pursevants, men of war with a bundell of rods, and
with axes to compel men to come in to his Kingdom? Commanded he to smite them
with swords and axes, who would not receive the Gospel? No, yea he would not
have them to take with them a staff, a scrip, or shoes: But though Christ
subdue all his enemies, Devils, and wicked men, it shall never follow that
Christ is for that, King and head of Devils, and wicked men: For Christ is as
Mediator King and Head, or mediatory King and Head of those that are the
subjects, and redeemed conquest of this King, and of those who are members of
the body of which he is Head, now this body is his Church only, Col. 1. 18. He
is the Head of the Body the Church, Ephesians. 1. 22, 23. And gave him to be Head
over all things to the Church, Which is his Body, the fullness of him that
fills all: The Body of Christ to be edified, Ephesi. 4 12. Till we all (all
that body of the Saints to be perfected, v. 11.) come in the unity of the
faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, v. 16. from whom the whole
Body fitly joined together, and compacted by that which every joint supplieth,
according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes
increase of the Body unto the edifying of it self in love: Now never Divine
can say, that Devils and wicked men, who shall bow to Jesus, are the subjects
of this Kingdom of Christ, who have right to the fruits of the Kingdom,
Righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, Romans 14. 17. far less
that they are of the Body; that is, Christ's Body, Christ's fullness, Christ's
Body to be perfected, edified, to Come in the unity of faith, and of the
knowledge of the Son of God, into a perfect man, etc.

Arg. 6. These Megistrates that are the mediatory vicars, deputies, and heads
of the Head Jesus Christ and his Kingdom, these are of his Body, and subjects
under the King and Mediator Christ, Magistrates as such not members of the
Church.
the chief Head and King: For it is not to be presumed, that Christ will
appoint these to be heads and vicars of his Body, and little Kings over his
Kingdom, as he is Mediator, who are not members of his Church, nor subjects of
his mediatory Kingdom: But Magistrates as Magistrates, are not members of his
Church, nor subjects of his mediatory Kingdom: no more then Husbands as
Husbands, Fathers as Fathers, are members; and their should have been Husbands
and Fathers, though the Lord Jesus never had been Mediator, advocate, and
Priest of a redeemed Church.

Obj. But are Pastors and teachers, and Elders as such, members of the
Christian Church?

Ans. If eyes and ears be members of the body, and watchmen members of the
city, then are they, ex officio, by their office members of the Church* But if
the Magistrate as a Magistrate be a member of the Church, then all Magistrates,
Heathen, and Turkish are members of the Christian Church, ex officio, by virtue
of their office.

Arg. 7. That opinion is not to be holden which lays ground, that Christ
Mediator is a temporary King, has under him Magistrates, even heathenish, who
have nothing to do with a Mediator Christ Mediator, not a temporary King.
to bear a temporal sword: for a supernatural and spiritual end as Christ^
under heirs, he himself being the first heir of all such* and so makes
heathens within the verge of the mediatory Kingdom; as if Christ were as
Mediator, a King to Heathen, and all and every one of mankind, who must have
Magistrates, and so makes the Kingdom of men as men, and the Kingdom of Grace
commensurable, and of alike latitude and extension, and makes nature and grace
of equal comprehension: But such is the former opinion, the proposition cannot
be denied, except by Arminians, Socinians, Papists, who do maintain an
universal redemption, a grace universal, a Catholic Kingdom of Grace
comprehensive of all and every man, of Pharaoh, Evil*merodach, Belshazer, all
the Kings of Romans, Persians, Assyrians, Chaldeans, and of Turk, India, and
such as worship the Sun and Moon, the Devil, and the work of men's hands: The
assumption is granted by Master Coleman who says, Christ is the rightful King
of the whole earth, he means Christ as Mediator, to whom the Father has
given a Kingdom.

Obj. Does not Christ as King make all his enemies his footstool, and subdue
all things to himself? Ergo, his Kingdom is as large as all things.

Ans. The Lord Jesus Christ's power Kingly, and his power mediatory, which
includes a power as God (for he is Mediator and a mediatory King, according to
both natures) does no way make him King of Devils, of Hell, of sin, of the
reprobate, and damned, no more then David's power over Ammonites, and Moabites,
makes him King and feeder of the Ammonites and Moabites: Never Divine said,
that Christ was King of Devils, and King of Hell; though he subdue Devils and
Hell, and make them his footstool, Col. 2. 15. But as hability and gifts was
not sufficient to make Christ a Priest, but he behooved to have (...) authority
and a lawful calling, Heb. 5. 4, 5. so he behooved to be called, set, and
established on the Holy-hill of Zion, as a King of the Fathers making, Psalm. 2.
5, 6. Psalm. 89. 26, 27, 28, 29. Luke 1. 32, 33. ver. 68, 69. 54, 55. And
therefore though as King and an eternal King, he subdue all things, even his
enemies; yet it follows not, he is King and Mediator, and Head of his enemies.

Arg. 8. All those whom Christ makes officers, Legates and Ambassadors of his
mediatory Kingdom, they have either the word of the Kingdom committed to them,
as Pastors and Doctors, and of old, Apostles, Evangelists, Prophets, that they
may make work on the consciences of men to make them Kings and Priests unto
God, or they are by the word of admonition and rebuke, to deal for the same
end, as governors and Elders, 1 Cor. 12. 28. 1 Timothy 5. 17. for the officers of
the Kingdom, and sword or scepter of the Kingdom, the Word of God, Psalm. 45.
4. Rev. 19. 15. Heb. 4. 11. Rev. 1. 16. which are the means, are congruously
proportioned, to the end, the gathering of the Saints, the perfecting of his
body, Ephesians. 2. 11, 12. But never did Christ appoint the Magistrate with his
sword, and his temporary rewards, and praise of well doing, to have any action
on the conscience of men, or to cooperate for so high an end directly and
kindly; for sure the sword cannot reach that end, except indirectly and by
accident, in some imperated acts: He may procure that there be such means as
word and seals, and So the Belgic Arminians, apol. fol. 302. Grotius in picta^
ordi. Hol. p. 113. Vte^b. p. 28.
Church Officers, and so be an intrinsecall mean to set up those which are the
spiritual and truly intrinsecall means, and this is all.

Object. 1. Was not this the first step of papal tyranny, that the Churchmen
would be exempted from the power of the Magistrate, and s^t themselves up as
supreme, collateral, Independent powers in all Ecclesiastical affairs, as the
Magistrate was supreme in all politic business?

Ans. It is a calumnious consequence, Pastors and Teachers will not be judged
by the Magistrate in things merely Ecclesisticall, ^o stand to his
Ecclesiastical decision, as if his lips, ex officio, should preserve
knowledge; Ergo, Pastors and Doctors do exempt themselves from the Lawful
power of the Magistrate in his civil judging by the sword; it is as if they
would say, Churchmen refuse to submit to an usurped and unlawful power of the
Magistrate; Ergo, they refuse to submit to their lawful power. 2. They bring
not one word to prove, that this was the first step of papal tyranny; now a
supremacy* and independency in doctrinals and civil things, the adversaries
deny not: If King Ahab find the Priests of Jehovah turn Priests of Baal, and
the Prophets prophecy lies, we and the adversaries agree that King Ahab has a
supreme independent power, to judge and punish them with the sword, and if King
Ahab will take on him to burn incense to the Lord, the Priests and Prophets of
the Lord have an immediate supreme independent power, to rebuke King Ahab for
usurping that which is independently and incommunicably proper to the Priests
only, and they may refuse to be judged by King Ahab, when he would judge them
for giving out this sentence, It belongs not to King Ahab, or King Vzziah to
burn incense to the Lord, but to the Priests, the sons of Aaron, 2 Chronicles. 26.
Will they say this supremacy of the Priests is a step to papal Tyranny? 3.
This is rather papal Tyranny it self that the Magistrate as head of the
Church, and as an Ecclesiastical person may as a Magistrate govern, in all
externalls, the Church, as he pleases, with a royal, supreme, independent
power; and because the Magistrate may send others to rule for him, 2 Chronicles. 19.
8, 9. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. Ergo, he may commit this royal power to a creature
called a Prelate as to his Deputy, in his name to judge; as Phocas gave first
a supremacy to Boniface the third, which no Bishop of Rome had before; and
judge if this be not the first step to Papal Tyranny? They possibly may say,
The Magistrate can commit no Magistraticall power to any Churchman, for Christ
for bad them to take on them the civil domination of the Lords of Gentiles,
Luke 22. 26, 27.

Ans. But this is an Ecclesiastic, not a civil administration; and if it be a
lawful Ecclesiastical supremacy, why may not the Magistrate who has power to
send Deputies to act in his name, depute a lawful Ecclesiastical power, to
Ecclesiastical persons, Pastors and Doctors, who in the mind of the
adversaries are all but the Deputies of the Magistrate in all that they do.

Obj. 2. But is it not Popery that the Magistrate shall be obliged as a Lictor
to execute the decrees of the Church? The Magistrate not the servant of the
Church.


Ans. I know not, if the Lictor with blind obedience be to behead John Baptist,
or if Doeg should kill the Lords Priests, because King Saul commands him. 2.
This Argument concludes that neither Magistrate nor people should believe
Articles of faith, because the Church and Pastors says so, but because Jehovah
says so, nor is the Ruler to believe or execute what the Church decrees,
because they decree it, but because he believes it is the will of Christ, what
they give out in Name of Christ. 3. Is it not Popery that the Pastors and
Teachers should execute the laws of the Magistrate both in dispensing Word,
Sacraments, and Discipline? for they may not as Pastors and Doctors judge
whether the Ecclesiastical decrees of the Magistrate be the will and mind of
Jesus Christ or no. The Magistrate in doctrine and discipline is the only
supreme judge here, as in all causes civil, as he exercises a (...) and a
dominion in the on Luke 22. 27. so also in the other, except the Adversaries
show us a difference. Yea as Mr. Pryn with the Erastians say, Because there is
no certain form of the government of the Church in Scripture, he has an
Arbitrary power as Magistrate to appoint any government in the Church not
contrary to the Word, any Officers, Prelates, and Cardinals, any ceremonies as
pleases him, and may impose them on the consciences of Pastors and people,
which is the highest Papal Tyranny on earth.

Obj. 3. If the Magistrate be therefore subject to the Church not as a
Magistrate, but as he scandalously transgresses the Law of God, so that the
Church may not rebuke and censure him, as either a Magistrate, or as a
Magistrate doing his duty, but only as a Transgressor: Then neither 1. one
particular Pastor as a Pastor is subject to the Church, yea no man in a lawful
calling or relation as such is subject to the Church, for the Church cannot
rebuke or censure a Husband as a Husband, a father as a father, a Painter as a
Painter, no more then the Church can censure a Magistrate as a Magistrate; for
then should the Church censure and condemn all these relations and callings, as
husband, father, painter, Magistrate as intrinsecally unlawful. Nor can the
Church censure and rebuke husband, father, painter, musician, etc. when they do
right, and do but fulfill their relations and callings, in doing the duties of
husband, father, painter, no more then the Church can censure and rebuke the
Magistrate when he does his duty.

Ans. 1. This is not the total, complete, and adequate cause, The adequate and
complete cause why the Magistrate is subject to the Church
why the Magistrate in spiritual things is subject to the Church, but the
half of the cause only; you must take in the other consideration, he is in
spiritualibus, subject to the Church, not only as he does sin; but 1. As he may
sin scandalously. 2. As he may be directed, informed, and swayed with precepts,
promises, counsels, threatenings toward a supernatural end to eternal life;
take in all these three, and we grant all. The Magistrate and all in other
relations and professions and callings are equally in spiritual things subject
to the Church, as the Ministers of Christ, and in all other relations and
callings, as fathers, husbands, painters, musicians, are in civil things
equally subject to the Magistrate, according to the three former cases in a
civil consideration.

Obj. 4. But then you must prove solidly from the word, that the Magistrate is
subject to the Church in spiritual things?

Ans. It is enough if I prove that the Magistrate is subject to the Church, to
Pastors and Doctors in things belonging to his soul, and as a man and a
Christian in civil things are subject to him, That the Magistrate is subject
to the rebukes and censures of the Church proved from the Word.
which to me is clear in the Word of God, as 1. Because Timothy and all
watchmen in their person are commanded to rebuke them that sin before all, and
that in the sight of God, and the Lord Jesus, and the elect Angels, without
preferring one before another, or doing any thing by partiality, 1 Timothy 5. 20,
21. 2 Timothy 4. 2. And if Levi must not know his father or his mother, in the
Lords cause, Deuteronomy. 33. 9. and Jeremiah in rebuking not be dismayed of Kings,
Princes, and Prophets, Ier. 1. 17. neither must Ministers accept the persons of
judges, Christ rebuked his mother to whom otherwise he was subject, Ioh. 2. 4.
Luke 2. 51. 2. There is the practice of the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles,
that they have rebuked Kings, Rulers, Magistrates, Priests, Prophets, every
page almost of the Old and New Testament says this. 3. God has no whit
exempted the Rulers from rebukes, as they be men, they can and do sin. 4.
Princes are the sheep of Christ, and redeemed as a part of the flock for the
which Christ gave the blood of God; Ergo, they are to be fed and watched over,
lest they also as grievous wolves prey upon the flock, Acts 20. 28, 29, 30.
then there must be some over them, and those who should speak the word of the
Lord to them, and so the word of rebuke, and who should watch for the souls of
Magistrates, as those who must give an account, whom the Magistrates must obey
as others in the same condition who have souls, Heb. 13. 7, 17. 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2,
3.* 1 These. 5. 12, 13, 14. 5. All the censures of the Church are for the good
of souls, that the Spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord, 2 These. 3. 14,
15. 1 Timothy 1. 19, 20. 1 Cor. 5. 5, 6. and for edification, 2 Cor. 10. 8. Jude
v. 23. Ergo, the souls of Magistrates should not be defrauded of this mean of
edification. 6. Pastors as Ministers, Stewards, Ambassadors, Watchmen, are
entrusted with the word of reconciliation, 1 Cor. 4. 1, 2. and 1 Cor. 3. 5. and
4. 15. 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20. 1 Timothy 3. 1. 2 Cor. 4 7. Ergo, they must divide the
Word aright to all within the family, 2 Timothy 2. 15. and rebukes and censures
are a part of the word of reconciliation, no less then promises, and they are
to prophecy death and life, as God in his word commands, Ezekiel. 3. 17, 18, 19,
20. and 13. 19. and 33. 7, 8, 9. 10.

7. The power of the Lord Jesus in censuring, is extended to men as ^ll doers,
not as Magistrates, or not Magistrates, 1 Cor. 5. 2. Gal. 5. 10. the power of
binding and loosing is extended to a trespassing brother, who will not hear the
Church, Mat. 18. 15, 16. and 16. 19, 20. The Magistrate is a brother, Deuteronomy. 17.
15. one of the Israel of God, as Saul was of of the Tribe of Benjamin, David of
Judah.

8. The Church may judge such as are within the Church, 1 Cor. 5. 12. but such
is the Christian Magistrate.

Christians share, Gal. 2. 28.

10. Discipline is a part of Christ's Kingly government, if the government be on

25. and 28. 31. Psalm. 45. 3. Rev. 1. 16. Then if Magistrates be the subjects of
Christ as King of the Church, they must be subject to those who preach the
Kingdom, carry the Scepter, and rule under Christ as King.

11. Upon the same ground, if they decree grievous decrees, Isa. 10. 1. Micah
3. 1. and be wolves ravening the prey, Ezekiel. 22. 27. let them have either
Royal or Parliamentary power, they are to be rebuked, debarred from the holy
things of God, excommunicated, and their sins bound in earth, as in heaven,
Mat. 18, 18. Mat. 16. 19. Nor should Courts or Parliaments or Thrones, be
cities of refuge to unjust and scandalous men.

12. Upon the same ground Magistrates are not to be deprived of the good of
private rebukes, and admonitions, except we hate the Magistrate in our heart,
and strive not to gain his soul, Levit. 19. 17. Mat. 18. 15, 16. Luke 17. 3, 4.

and when he grants that Apostates and Idolaters are not members of the
Church, and that they are to be cast out of the Church, as he does also; he
must either grant that Christian Magistrates cannot turn Apostates and
Idolaters, which is against Scripture and experience, or that if they turn
Apostates and Idolaters, they remain no longer members of the Church, but are
to be excommunicated; or then Christ must have made some special exception,
that Kings though Idolaters and Apostates, do yet remain members of the Church,
and are not to be cast out of the Church, which (beside that Erastus cannot
show) is contradictory to his words: Hence it is clear, the Magistrate if he
turn as Saul did, a wicked man, he is to be excommunicated: But 1. By whom? by
the Church? Erastus will deny he can be judged by the Church, because he is
above the Church: by himself? that is against reason: By other Magistrates? he
is the only supreme in that Church, and by what reason he is above the Church,
he is above the other Magistrates, and other Magistrates are guilty of the same
fault.

Obj. 5. The supreme and principal power (called Architectonica of governing
the Church in externals, either agree to the Magistrate, or to the Church; not
to the Magistrate (as they say) if to the Church: Then 1. The universal care
and inspection over the Church is taken from the Magistrate, and given to the
Church; Ergo, 2. Then the Christian Magistrate not indirectly only, but
directly must be obliged to follow the judgment of the Church, in ordaining,
depriving, punishing of Ministers, or of any excommunicated. 3. The subjects
must be obliged not to obey, yea, to disobey the Magistrate, if he decern any
thing contrary to the Church; and the Magistrate as a lictor and servant must
execute all.

Ans. 1. There is no reason to say, that the supreme and principal power by
way of royal dominion (as the argument supposes) in Church matters, should
agree to either Magistrate on earth, or Church; it is a Rose of the Crown of
him who is the only King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and so the Major is
false: Nor is that care and inspection which is due to the Magistrate, taken
from him when we ascribe to Christ what is his due. 2. Neither does it follow,
that the Magistrate is directly obliged to follow the judgment of the Church,
except we did make the judgment of the Church supreme and absolute, and armed
with such a dominion as the adversaries give to the Magistrate; in which case
it follows, that the Church is directly and absolutely obliged to follow the
judgment of the Magistrate, according to the way of the adversaries; and that
if this argument be good, they must ascribe blind obedience, either to the
Church or Magistrate, not to the Magistrate they say; Ergo, to the Church: Nor
can they take it off by saying that the Magistrates dominon is limited by the
Word of God; for they know that we teach, that all the constitutions and
decrees of Synods made by the Church as the Church, is limited by the Word of
God; yet they cease not to object to us, that we make the Magistrate a servant,
and a lictor to the Church, and obliged by his place to give blind obedience to
the Church, and therefore they are obliged to answer the argument, and remove
papal dominion from their way, according to their own argument, if they will
be willing to take in to themselves, with the same measure, that they give out
to others: But if they give a ministerial power of judging to the Church, (the
argument is easily answered) which they cannot give to the Magistrate, except
they make his office to oblige the conscience, and his commands as
magistraticall to be given out under the pain of the second death: Now his
sword is too short to reach to this, I hope, except you make the vengence that
he executes on evil doers Romans 13. to be eternal fire, and his sword to be no
material nor visible sword, but such as commands Devils and Hell, which is
absurd; for the Magistrates power of judging and commanding, is commensurable
to his power of rewarding and punishing, that is, both is temporary, within
time, on the body of this world: The Pastors have a power of commanding, though
only ministerial, but free of all domination, or external coaction, which is
spiritual, and the punishment is accordingly spiritual, a binding in earth
and heaven; I borrow only the word of punishment, it being no such thing
properly.

Obj. 6. If the end of the Church be a spiritual, and of the Magistrate be a
temporal good; and if the Magistrate have no spiritual power to attain to his
temporal end, no more then the Church has any temporal power to attain to
her spiritual end; is not this a contradiction, that the Magistrate should
determine what the true Church and Ordinances are, and then set them up with
the power of the sword? for the Magistrates power to judge and punish in
spiritual causes, must be either spiritual or civil, or then he has none,
and so acts without commission: Now for civil power, the Magistrate has it
only over the bodies and goods of men, and has it not over the soul, nor can
he have it (say ^) in soul cases: It is confessed that the Magistrate has no
spiritual power to attain a temporal end, and therefore those who provoke the
Magistrate, without either civil or Blood Ten. c. 84. p. 122, 12*
spiritual power to punish, or prosecute, in spiritual causes, are to fear
that they come too near to those frogs that proceed out of the mouth of the
Dragon and Beast, and false Prophet, who with the same argument stir up the
Kings of the earth to make war against the Lamb and his followers, Rev. 17.
Bloody Tenent.

Answ. 1. All this argument is builded on a great mistake, and a And. Riv. in
decal. in Mand. 5. page 206. Though the Magistrate pupunish Ecclesiastical
scandals, yet his power to judge and punish is not Ecclesiastical and
spiritual* as the Church rebukes and censureth civil breaches of the second
table, and yet their power is not civil.
conseqence never proved, except by this one word of the Author. (Therefore say
I) and it is this: The Magistrate has no civil power over the soul, therefore
(say I) he has no power in soul matters, and cannot judge and punish in
spiritual causes. Sir, this is a non sequitur, The learned Divine Rivetus
says well, The Magistrates power in spiritual things to judge and punish, is
formaliter, and in it self and intrinsecally civil, but objective in regard of
the object and extrinsecally, it is spiritual. 1. I ask when the Author and
his take a professor into Church Communion, they judge whether he be just,
merciful, and peaceable, when they excommunicate any member, for murder, for
unjustice in taking away the goods of his brother? whether the Church does
judge and punish in the causes of justice, mercy and peace, which properly
belongs to the civil Magistrate, not to the Church properly; but only
ratione scandali as they are offensive in the Church of God: I ask (I say) if
the Churches power in judging and punishing be civil, or spiritual; not
civil, for this Author will say, that the Church has no power over the lives
and goods of men, those belong to the Magistrate, and to his civil power: Yet
he cannot deny, but the Churches power in judging and punishing here, is
formally spiritual, and objectively and unproperly civil; so say I the
Mgaistrates power in spiritual causes, is formally civil and objectivel^ only
spiritual, and he neither has, nor needs any spiritual power formally to
attain his temporal end, nor needs the Church any power formally civil to
attain her spiritual end: The reason is, because powers have their
specification and nature from their formal object, not from the material;
because the Magistrate punishes here^ies and false Doctrine as they disturb
the Peace of the civil State; therefore his power is civil, and because the
Church censureth unjustice, incest, 1 Cor. 5, 1, 2. and sins against the second
Table, because they are scandalous in the Church, and makes the name of God to
be ill spoken of, though materially those sins be punishable by the Magistrate,
yet is the Churches power spiritual, because it judges those as scandalous
and offensive to God; and therefore the power is spiritual, because the
object, to wit, as scandalous to the Church, and as offensive to God is
spiritual, even as destructive to civil Peace, is formally a civil object.
2. The Magistrate without any spiritual power judges what is the true Church
and true ordinances, sets them up by his sword; he does set them up only for
a civil end, because they conduce most for the peace and flourishing condition
of the civil state, whereof he is head, not that the members of his state may
attain life eternal; for the Magistrate intends life eternal to his
subjects in setting up a true Church, and true Ordinances, not as a Magistrate,
but as a godly man: As the woman of Samaria brought out the Samaritanes, that
they might receive Christ in their heart by says, as she had done: But as a
Magistrate he intends not life eternal to his subjects; so a Master as a
Master, hireth a man to serve who is a believer, and as a Master he judges
such a one will be most faithful, and active in his service; now the Master
judges him not to be a Saint, that he may be a fit member of the Church: The
Church only as the Church is to judge so of this servant, nor does he judge him
a believer, that he may obtain life eternal, nor does he love and choose him as
his servant, that he may obtain life eternal; Christians as Christians, judge
and love one another that way: So the Husband as a Husband does choose a
believing woman for his Wife, judging she will perform the duties of a Wife,
better then an unbelieving Wife, he judges her to be a believer as a Husband,
and loves her with a Husband-love as a Husband; but if he love her because the
image of God is in her, and as an heir of life eternal, then he loves her as
a Christian man, not as a Husband, and it is a Christian love he has to her,
such as he has to other godly women that are also co* heirs with himself of
life eternal; and this is a lawful and a Christian love: But if this Husband
should bear a Husband-love, such as he does to his own Wife, to all other godly
Wives, it should be an adulterous and unlawful love: So the Magistrate as a
Magistrate, judges, loves, chooses, and sets up true Ordinances, a true
Church, as means of a flourishing Kingdom, and of external Peace, and pulls
down the contrary as means destructive to the peace and safety of his subjects:
But he judges not in a spiritual manner, and with any spiritual power of the
sword, of those as fitting and conducing to life eternal, and inward peace of
conscience with God; but as a justified and believing Saint, he judges,
chooses, and loves Ordinances, and the true Church in this consideration, and
no wise as a Magistrate: If those Relations of Magistrate and Christian had
been considered by the Author, he had not compared the Magistrate punishing
idolatry to the Dragon, and the godly Pastors who exhort the Magistrate to
punish false teachers to the Beast, and the false Prophet, who makes war with
the Lamb: For the godly magistrate who advances the throne of the Lamb, is
praise worthy; he does cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord,
Psalm. 101. 8. and does this as a Magistrate, that his Kingdom might have peace
and well grounded prosperity; but as a man according to Gods heart he does it
formally set on high the throne of the Lamb, nor would he have compared those
worthy and dear brethren of New England the Saints of the most high, especially
reverend Master Cotton to the frogs that proceeded out of the mouth of the
false Prophet, Rev. 17. 3. Nor do the Papists use this argument at all, but
another argument, and for a contrary conclusion; for the Pope as the Pope is an
earthly Monarch, and as Pope has power to translate Crowns and Kingdoms, and
as Pope the Holy Ghost in him commands the Kings of the Earth, to make war
with the Lamb and his followers, as Papists teach; do we ascribe any such
power be the Church or Churchmen? are Malignants, Prelates, and Papists, the
followers of the Lamb?

Obj. 7. If the people may erect what government they will, and seems most fit
for their civil condition; then governments by them so erected have no more
power, nor for no longer time then the civil power or people consenting and
agreeing shall betrust them with; for people are not deprived of their natural
freedom by the power of tyrants: And if so, that Magistrates receive their
power of governing the Church from the people; Then a people as a people
naturally considered (of what Nature or Nation soever in Europe, Asia, Africa,
America) have fundamentally and originally as men, a power to govern the
Church, to see her do her duty, to correct her, to redress, to reform, to
establish, etc. And this is to subject God, Christ, heaven, the spirit, to
natural, sinful, and unconstant men: Indian and American governments are as
true and lawful governments as in the world; and therefore their governors
are keepers of the Church and of both Tables (if any Church should arise or be
amongst them) and therefore (if Christ* have betrusted the civil power with
his Church) they must judge according to their Indian and American consciences,
for others they have not.

Ans. 1. No doubt the power that makes Magistrates, because Blood Tenent. c.
93. page 137, 138.
of virtue and dexterity to govern, may unmake them when they turn tyrants, and
abuse their power; and upon the same ground, as men create Magistrates, so
Christian men as Christian men, act to choose Christian and gracious
Magistrates: as if a Husband as a man choose a Wife (as grace perfumeth and
spiritualizeth all the common actions of men) so Christian men are to choose
Christian Wives, Christian Masters, Christian servants; so is a Church to choose
a Christian, not an American Magistrate, Deu. 17. they are not to choose a
stranger, but one from amongst their brethren, and men fearing God, and hating
coveteousnes, Exo. 18. 21. Deu. 17. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. and 1. 16. and that
a Christian Magistrate receive People as people may give power to a Magistrate
to add his auxiliary power to defend the Church, judge and punish offenders in
the Church
power to govern in the Church (I deny him to be a Governor of the Church)
from Christian people, I see no inconvenience: Suppose that a Christian woman
choose a Pagan Husband, she sins in her choice; and as a sinful woman chooses a
Pagan who has no other then a Pagan conscience, to be the guide of her youth,
and her head, and to love her, as Christ loved his Church, and to rule her
according to his marital and Husband-power in some acts of her Christian
conversation: Yea, when Christians did fight under Heathen Emperors, they gave
power as all soldiers do to their Commanders, to those Heathen Captains, to
command Christians according to their Pagan consciences, for other consciences
it cannot be supposed Heathen have as this Author speaks; nor do I see such
an inconvenience, that men as men choose a Magistrate who is a Heathen, to see
not the Church as the Church; but men of the Church do their duty, and to
punish them civilly when they omit Church duties, when providence compels
Judah: Yea, when God commands Judah to submit to a Babylonish or Persian
King, who according to his Babylonish conscience is to command them to keep the
oath of God, to abstain from murder* yea, to build again the house of God, and
is to punish the men of Judah, if they do the contrary: Here evidently the
Church is to choose Heathen Kings, who according to their Heathen consciences,
are to judge and punish sins against both Tables; but they choose them to add
there auxiliary power to help and desend the Church, not any privative or
absolute power to set up what ordinances they will: Nor is it supposed that men
as men may give to Indian and American Magistrates, power to judge, by rule of
Indian consciences; what is blasphemy against Jesus Christ, what is apostasy
from the Christian says, to Iuda^sme, and to punish it: For in that fare, the
Indian Magistrate is incapable of Magistracy in those acts, though essentially
he be a lawful Magistrate in other acts; just as Christian men and Saints by
calling may make a Christian Corinthia^ amongst themselves, their Magistrate;
and yet he cannot judge whether Ti^ius the Physi^ian in Corinth has poisoned
Sempronius, as he has a Christian conscience, but not a medicinal conscience
(to speak so) or the skill and art of a Physi^ian to know what is poison, what
not; yet did men as men create this Christian Magistrate, to judge and punish
murders, and poisoning of Christians. 2. Let us also turn the Tables: the
Author cannot deny, but Ten thousand Christians and Indians, half of each side,
may come to be one civil incorporation; they create with common consent a
Christian Magistrate over themselves, this they do as a society of men. The
Indians worship their God in that society, by offering their children to the
Devil, and this is their Indian conscience; for it is not to be supposed that
an Indian can worship his God with other then an Indian conscience: By this
Authors way, Indians and Christians gave to this Christian Magistrate, to judge
of this Indian and bloody worship, with a Christian conscience, for it is
supposed he can judge with no other conscience: I demand whether or not this
Magistrate be obliged to punish such horrid shedding of innocent blood? If he
be, he is set over this incorporation to bear the sword of the Lord, and with a
Christian conscience to judge and punish Indian consciences: Is not this as
great an inconvenience as what he objecteth to us? Besides that, according to
this way, he must not punish the killing of the children to the Devil; why?
this is against the will of the meek Savior in whom the Christian Magistrate
believes, to persecute an Indian for his conscience, as this Author thinks:
Now it is no less an Indian conscience worship, and no murder to offer an
innocent child to the Indian God, then it was to the Jews to offer an innocent
Bullock or a Ram to Jehovah.

Obj. But God has forbidden in the Law of nature to kill infants to God upon
any pretense.

Ans. In the Law of nature God has forbidden all false worship. 2. The Law of
nature has forbidden to offer any blood to God, that is, the Law of nature
will never warrant us to offer in a whole brunt offering an innocent Beast to
God, created for the use of man, and it should be against the Law of nature, to
kill Beasts for any religious use, or for any use, except to be food or
medicine for man: Except God in a positive Law, had commanded whole burnt
offerings, and offering of Beasts to God: so the Law of nature forbids Indians
to kill infants; but they tell you, there is a positive Law of their God, and
in conscience they are obliged to kill their children to this God, and you must
convince their conscience, that this is murder, not right worship, by reason
and light of truth, not with a club and force of sword, which has no influence
upon the conscience.

3. It follows not, that God has subjected God, Christ, Heaven, the Spirit
to natural men; for an Indian Magistrate remaining an Indian, never received
power from mem as men, nor from God, to judge of Christian worship: yea, Indian
Magistrates as Indians are incapable of judging or punishing what is against
Christ, Heaven, the Spirit, and yet they are Lawful Magistrates; for their
ignorance of Christ excludes them from having any such formal power; what
Magistraticall power they have which they cannot put forth in acts, is not to a
purpose for this power, which they cannot exercise, shall never subject,
Christ, Heaven, the Spirit to the consciences of natural men, or Indian
Magistrates: this consequence therefore should have been proved* not presumed
as a truth. 4. He says, If any Church should arise amongst those who have
Indian Magistrates, Christ should betrust the Indian civil power with his
Church. I answer, This is non-consequence also, for the state of heathenship in
the Indian, should exclude him from any such trust; if a Church arise they are
to be under the Indian Magistrate, while God in his providence free them from
under him, that they may choose a Christian Magistrate, who may be a
nurse-father to them? 5. The Lord be trusts his Church to the civil power as
an auxiliary power, not to exercise any magistraticall power over the Church,
and over their conscience; but only for the Churches good, and for their
conscience.

Church in captivity. The Christian Magistrate is a Governor for the Church; 1.
Men are governed as men politically by Magistrates though Heathen. 2. Men are

Church Officers called (...), Heb. 13. 7. 13. who watches for our Souls, and
are over us in the Lord, and must give an account to God, whom we are to obey

all doubts, if we say in Church Government, that the doctrinal and declarative
part is in the Ministers of Christ, as Mat. 28. Go teach, etc. and the punitive
and censuring part in the Christian Magistrate, Romans 13. according to that for
the punishing of evil doers, as Mr. Coleman says.

Ans. This Erastian way will intricate us not a little, and is destructive The
distinction of an doctrinal or declarative, and of a punitive part of
Church Government, of which the former is given to Pastors, the latter to the
Magistrate, a heedlesse and senseless notion.
of the Covenant of both Kingdoms. 1. Its a distinction void of Scripture and
reason, for the Apostolic Churches by it must have no Government as Churches
at all: for to publish the Gospel which is made the one half; Yea, all
Church Government (for this punitive part is a dream) is not Church Government,
nor any part thereof.

1. Master Coleman desires that the Parliament would give to preachers Doctrine
and power of preaching and wages, learning and competency: as for Governing of
the Church, let the Magistrate have that, Ministers have other work to do, and
such as will take up the whole man. Sermon, Page 24, 25. Then preaching the
Word to the Church, cannot be any part of Governing of the Church.

2. Because Church government is properly acted by the Church, with the power
of the keys, to bind and loose in earth, as in Heaven by Church Censures, and
pardoning of an offender, and committed to many, to the Church, to a society
gathered together, Mat. 18. 18. 1 Cor. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But publishing of the
Gospel is done by one single Pastor, even to the end of the world, even where
there is no Church, even in the hearts of the Athenienses, Act. 17. 33, 34. of
Felix, Act. 24. 25. of the Iayler not Baptized, Act. 16. 29, 30, 31. of the
woman of Samaria, Ioh. 4. 28, 29, 30. The Gospel exercises a doctrinall and
external government on thousands, the like without the Church visible: yea,
and who never are members of a visible Church; is this any Church Government of
which we now speak? and in all the Scripture a power of the keys to govern the
visible Church, was never committed to any one single man by Jesus Christ; if
an Apostolick-priviledge of Paul's excommunicating his alone be objected, I can
easily answer, Apostles continue not to the end of the world. 2. This doctrinal
publishing of the word, is the plants and flowers of the Gardens but
Church Government is the hedge, and those two are not to be confounded. 3. Paul
differenceth them as two distinct qualities of a Preacher, 1 Timothy 3. while he
will have him apt to teach, ver. 2. and v. 4, 5. one that can rule the Church
of God well; and 1 Timothy 5. 17. ruling well, is distinguished from laboring in
the Word and Doctrine as a charge worthy of less honor, from a charge worthy
of double honor. 4. All Protestant Divines distinguish Doctrine and
Government, the former belonging to the being and essence of a visible Church,
as an essential note thereof, I mean the public and settled publishing of the
Gospel; the other is only a thing belonging to the well being of the visible
Church, and an accident thereof; so it is a heedlesse tenent to make the former
a part with the latter. 5. When we swear a conformity of Doctrine and worship
in one Confession, one Catechism, one Directory, we do not swear the same over
again, when we swear to endeavor the nearest uniformity in Church Government,
etc. which we cannot but do, if the Doctrine and Worship be nothing but a part
of Church Government; or if it be all Church Government: n^w if Mr. Colemans
punitive part be but his own dream, as I hope is easily proved, there is no
Church Government at all. Now how Mr. Coleman did swear to endeavor the
nearest uniformity of a Chimera, and a thing that is just nothing, let himself
consider.

As for Mr. Colemans punitive part of Church Government by the Magistrate, this
by his way is done by the power of the sword of the Magistrate, says he, and
therefore cites Romans 13. He bears not the sword in vain, etc. Hence either
the Apostolic Church had no censures at all, and so no visible government and
order, but preaching of the Word was all; and except we would add to our
pattern, and be more wise then the Holy Ghost and the Apostles, we ought to
have no Church Government, but only preaching the Word; or then the Apostles,
Pastors, and Teachers meddled with the sword of the Emperor Nero in discharging
the punitive part, for with no other instrument does the Magistrate punish
ill-doers, but with the sword, Romans 13. 4, 5. This text Mr. Coleman cites to
make bloody Nero a Church-governour: But no ground is for this in the Word,
that Paul, Peter, Timothy, Archippus meddled with the Emperors sword, or that
the weapons of their warfare were carnal; or that Paul was the Minister of God,
bearing the sword for the punishment of evil doers: I think Paul speaks That
the Magistrates punishing with the sword, seandalous persons should be a part
of Church Government, a reasonlesse conceit.
of civil bodily punishing, Romans 13. and no violence greater can be offered to
the Word of God; for if that power be an Ecclesiastical administration, every
soul, and so the Christian Magistrate, is to be subject to this Ecclesiastical
and Church power; and if so, then to the Church: If Mr. Coleman deny the
consequence, I conceive to be subject to the Magistrate, is Romans 13. to be
subject to the power civil, that is, of God: If the Magistracy be an
Ecclesiastical ordinance and a vicegerent power of the mediator, as they say it
is; then to be subject to the Magistrate, is to be subject to this Church
power, and to be subject to the Church. 2. The punishing power of the
Magistrate as such, does not bind and loose on Earth, and open and shut Heaven;
for then hoc ipso, because the Magistrate does judge and punish evil doers, the
man's sin should be bound in Heaven; now so the judging and punishing power
should take hold of the conscience: But it is certain, the Magistrate as judge
may take away the life of a Capital Delinquent, when he knows the man
repents and believes, and finds mercy with God; Ergo, this magistratical
power is not Ecclesiastical; for if the man to the knowledge of all repent, the
Church has no power to bind his sin on Earth, nor will God bind his sin in
Heaven; but yet the Magistrate as a Magistrate is to punish; Ergo, this
punishing power is no Ecelesiastical power, nor any part of Church Government.

3. The punitive power of the Magistrate has influence on men as ill-doers,
whether they be within the Church or without the Church, and works on men as
Members of the Common wealth, whether Christians, or Heathens, Indians, or
Americans: But no punitive power of the Church, is or can be extended to those
that are without the Church, but Pastors and the Church leaves them to be
judged of God, 1 Cor. 5. 12. nor can they be cast out of the visible Church,
who were never within it.

4. The punitive power of the Church as such, flows from Christ as Mediator,
Head and King of the Church; because Christ as Head and Mediator, has
appointed a shepherds staff, discipline, or rebukes, Church Censures, and
Excommunication for his sheep, his redeemed ones, family, and people, for whom
he is Mediator, his Scepter and Rod must be congruously and sutably
proportioned to his Crown, and spiritual Royal power: But the punitive power of
Magistrates flows from God the Creator, as the whole world is the family of
God; so for the preservation of humane society, the Lord has been pleased to
appoint Magistrates, and the punitive power of them by the sword, to correct
ill-doers for the peace, good, and safety of humane societies.

5. All punitive Church Power is for edification, 2 Cor. 10. 8. That the man's
spirit may be savdd in the day of the Lord, 1 Cor. 5. 5. that the party may be
gained by private and public Church rebukes, Mat. 18. 15. If he hear thee,
thou have gained thy Brother, v. 18. If he neglect to hear the Church, let him
be to thee as an Heathen, etc. Ergo, if he hear the Church his soul is gained,
2 Thessalonians. 3. 14, 15. 1 Timothy 1. 19. but the intrinsecal end of punishing an evil
doer, is not the gaining of his soul, but a political civil satisfaction of
justice for a wrong done to humane society, that others may fear, and do so no
more; the Magistrate in using his sword as a Magistrate, looks not to this as
the intrinsecall end of the sword, to convert a soul, to augment the number of
the subjects of Christ's mediatory Kingdom; nor does he as a Magistrate
proportion the measure of the stroke of the sword according to the repentance
and godly sorrow of the man who has sinned; but in justice his eye is not to
pity or spare the blasphemer, though as dear to him as a father and friend,
Deuteronomy. 13. 6, 8, 9. 10. Deuteronomy. 33. 9. whether he repent, or not repent; but the
Church censure, respecting intrinsecally the gaining of the soul, is
proportioned to the offenders sorrow for his sin, that he be not swallowed with
over much sorrow, 2 Cor. 2. 7, 8, 9, 10. There is neither coaction, nor
properly so called punishment in the Church. Trigland. dis. The^lo. de potest.
civil et Ecclefiast. c. 13. p. 257.


6. This punitive part of Church Government, is neither in name, nor in thing:
in Scripture Triglandius denies that there is any Ecclesiastical, co-active,
or compulsive power properly so called in the Church; there is no violence used
by Christ as King of his Church; this shepherd carries the Lambs in his
bosom* Isai. 40. 11. Hyeronimus said well, The King or Magistrate rules over
men that are unwilling, he means in punishing them; but the Pastor does it to
men that are willing: And renowned Salmasius citing this, adds that of the
Apostle Peter to the Elders, Feed the flock (...); It is not pena a proper
punishment that the Church does inflict, nor does the Scripture Hyeronymus in
Epitaphio N^potiani, Rex ^olentibus priest, episcopus volentibus. Cl. Salm. in
apparatu ad libr^s de primati. part. 1. p. 154. 155. adeo autem vole^tibus
p^nitentia dab^tur ut negata pro paena esset, et pro beneficio peteretur atque
acciperetur, a delinquentibus, ut ex multis Canonibus concili^rum constat,
Epistolis Canonicis, et scriptis aliis patrum.
speak so, nor is the thing it self punishment, or any punitive power here;
indeed all co-active power of the Magistrate as the Magistrate, and all
punishment issuing from it, is against the will of the punished, and is
inflicted with the dominion of the sword; we know how the Adversary side here
with Papists who make all Church censures to be pennances inflicted upon
penitents against their will: Therefore says Salmasius, Of old, censures were
so voluntary, that to deny them was a punishment, and they were desired and
sought as a Benefit, as the ancient Canons of Councels, and Canonick Epistles,
and writings of Fathers bear witness; and this does prove, if Jesus Christ
have a willing people, Psalm. 110. and if rebukes and censures be to the Saints
as medicine that will not break the head, Psalm. 141. 5. no medicine is received
unwillingly by wise men, and no medicine is a punishment; then the punitive
power of the Magistrate has no place in the Church as the Church.

7. The Magistrate dispenses no Ecclesiastical censures as a Magistrate: For
1. He rebukes not as a Magistrate, for rebukes as rebukes intrinsecally tend
to the gaining of the soul; so as to receive rebukes willingly, is a Character
of a child of God, and to hate it a sign of a wicked man, Ecclesi. 7. 5. Prove.
28. 23. and 6. 23. and 1. 23. c. 13. 18. c. 15. 5. 10. 31. 32. Prove. 5. 12. and
10. 17. and 15. 10. and 9. 8. and 13. 1. so the sword cannot inflict this
censure, nor can the Magistrate cast out of the Synagogue or Church; he can
banish, which is a local casting out; but not excommunicate, if he be said to
be an Ecclesiastical person exercising punitive power in the Church, because
he judges and punishes sins against the Church, 1. This is nothing, except he
inflict spiritual punishment of rebuking and excommunication, which he cannot
do, because he has not to do with the conscience, or the converting of a
sinner. 2. If he be a Church-governour, because he punishes sins against the
Church, but in so far as they disturb the Peace of the State, then Pastors may
be civil Governors, and use the sword, which Christ forbids, Luke 22. 26,
27. and 12. 13, 14. because they inflict spiritual punishment, such as public
rebukes on murderers, parricides, but in a spiritual way, to gain souls to
Jesus Christ; and they rebuke murders, thefts, thought not as committed
against the State and Peace of humane societies, but as offensive to God,
scandalous to the Church, and destructive to the souls of those who commit such
offenses: All the punishment Ecclesiastical which we plead for (though we
borrow only the name, it being unproperly so called) is spiritual rebukes,
debarring of wicked men from the society of the Saints, and the holy things of
God, that they pollute not such pearls. Bullinger is alleged by Erastus as a
favourer of this way, and some private Epistles of Bullinger written to Erastus
cited, but nothing of the public writings of Bullinger: It is true he says,
he is pleased with Erastus his Theses, but 1. That he was not of Erastus his
mind wholly, is evinced from these Epistles. 1. Bullinger strove with the
Anabaptists of his time, That Bullinger is not of the mind of Erastus. Bulling.
Epis. private. ad Erastum.
who contended for either a Church of regenerate persons, or none. Bullinger.
Diu cum Anabaptistis nostris contendimus hac de re, et ostendimus veram
Ecclesiam posse esse, et dici Ecclesiam, quae excommunicatione hac careat. 2.
He says, he himself, D. Wolphius, Lavater, Hallerus, Zwinglius, Gualther,
never condemned the Church of Geneva; Ergo, they never condemned Presbyterial
Government. 3. He says it will be for the edification of the Churches of the
Palatine, that this excommunication be. Now we know diverse there ascribed to
the Magistrate plus aequo, and said that the tithes belonged jure divino to the
Magistrate: The truth is these Divines were too obnoxious to the lust of
Christian Magistrates. Calvin, Farel, complain much of the Magistrates
usurpation in this. 4. They thought hard to exulcerate the minds of Princes to
excommunicate the Magistrate, and long magis abalienatos reddere, inferiores
gradus conscendere, superiores vero intactos reddere: But was it not an abuse
to excommunicate the poor people, and spare the Magistrate?

3. Bullinger would not have the question of excommunication Bull. Epis. ad
Erast.
to come in public; why? cum hoc tempore alias satis afflicta sit Ecclesia.

4. He seems to incline that none should be debarred from the Lords Table, that
acknowledges their sins, coena sit libera omnibus peccata sua agnoscentibus et
veniam a Christo petentibus; we say Amen, so they be truly penitent to the
Church, and not such as Paul speak of, 2 Timothy 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. to whom
confession of sins before the Church is a manifest form of godliness.

5. Bullinger and Gualther writ to the Prince Elector to punish scandalous
persons: But with all quanquam arbitramur illust. Principem admonitionem
nostram sibi soli reservaturum, qua duntaxat dissidia manefesta in Ecclesia
praevenire voluimus: Hence this ( tecum sentimus) of Bullinger written to
Erastus was; 1. His private opinion, that he desired not to be known to the
Churches; therefore Erastus wronged Bullinger, who left his secret letters to
be printed. 2. Many learned men in these Churches beside Anabaptists, and the
Palatinate Catechism were against Erastus.

6. He says Zwinglius was the chief man to have excommunication Epist. ad
Erastum.
brought in inductam cuperet.

7. He desired Beza not to answer Erastus, for peaces cause, and the same he
wrote to Erastus.

A learned and holy preacher to the Prince Elector, wrote thus Petr. Dathenus.
to Bullinger. Queror (fr. m. d. dilecte) quod approbaris Theseis D. Erasti,
contra disciplinam Ecclesiasticam scriptas, quae non tantum impiae sunt, sed
viam sternunt ad Atheismum; hortor et obsecro ut public testeris te novas
illas Theseis improbare, Quod nisi seceris, futurum est ut videaris dissentire
non tantum a docta illa vetustate, sed etiam a Zwinglio, et Oecolampadio
aliisque, adeoque et cum teips^ pugnare.

Bullinger in 1 Cor. 5. Excommunicatio non est exercenda, ut Anabaptistae
volunt, a toto Ecclesiae coetu, sed a dilectis ad hoc hominibus.

Excommunicatio apud veteres est exclusio a communione Sacramentorum.

Excommunicatio est supplicium temporale, disciplina externa ad medendam
instituta.

Bullinger in Mat. 18. esse Ethnicum et publicanum significat esse et haberi
inter facinorosos, quibus nihil neque officij neque sinceri committas.

Idem. Hortor ut salutare hoc pharmacum (excommunicationis) e caetu Sanctorum
pontificis avarit^a eliminatum reducatur.

Idem in Mat. 18. finis consilij domini est, (in negotio disciplinae) ut
corrigantur scelerati in Ecclesia, et auferantur scandala.

Bullinger in 2 These. 3. hic habemus abstensionem sen exclusionem, qua a
tribuum societate et publicorum pascisorum usu-fructu excludimus ^on^^maces et
omnes admonitiones contemnentes; aliter etiam locus potest interpretari. These
be contradictory to Erastus his expositions, and way which makes
excommunication nothing, and puts all Church Discipline on the point of the
Magistrates sword. I cannot say but that saying did too little prevail with
Bullinger, Amicus Socrates, Amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas: for Erastus
was his intimate and too dear friend, etiam er^ores amicorum et n^^i sunt nobis
pergrati.

Bullinger in Mat. 18. in illa: Dic Ecclesiae. Excommunicatio est disciplina
^xterna sanctorum in Ecclesia conversantium, qua ex communione abii^iuntur
sanctorum, aut commode alioqui corriguntur, coercent^^ve qui scandalizant
Ecclesiam, -- hae particulares Ecclesiae deligunt sibi quoque veluti Senatum

admonebat, corripiebat graviter, add et consortio excludebat Ecclesiastico, si
nihil emendationis expectari posse videretur, -- 1 Cor. 5. decrevi ut is qui

I grant it was the error of that worthy instrument of Reformation that he
refers all to the Christian Magistrate: and so he says, haec omnia --
pertinen^ ad illas Ecclesias tantum quae Christianum Magistratum non habent;
non potest hic certi quiequam praescribi, sed fideles et prudentes Ministri pro
condition temporum, publici status et necessitatis Ecclesiasticae disciplinam

of Religion to Aaron, and the Ministers the servants of the Christian

the Anabaptists were right, and Gualther in an error in this point.

Gualther. in 1 Cor. 5. accusat Eccl^siam propter incestum, quod incestuosum
non sine publica totius Eccl^siae infamia nimis diu tolerarint -- propter unius
hominis scelus totam Corinthiorum Ecclesiam, et imprimis hujus praefectos et

graviter accusat; sed ita illi merebantur, quod indulgentiores fuissent

debuissent.

intolerabilem.

Nec enim mihi necessarium videtur, ut Ecclesiae Christi^nae is it a ad se

sunt etiam alii qui etsi principes habeant vere Christianos, neque leges desint
quibus morum licentia coercetur, ad hoc tamen senatu Eccl^siastico opus esse
aiunt, qui in quorumvis mores animadvertat, et cui in principes quoque jus sit,
et eos qui scandalum aliquod publicum dederunt, a caenae dominioae communione
arceat, et eosdem non nisi suo judicio probatos, et praestitis prius
satisfactionibus publicis ad Ecclesiae societatem et caenae usum rursus
admittat -- quasi vero non alia disciplinae forma institui posset, quam quae
ipsis conficta est. Distingunt illi inter jurisdictionem Ecclesiasticam et
politicam quoad meram disciplinam et scelerum poenas, at distinctio ista ex
pontificorum officina deprompta est; in sacris vero scripturis nusquam habetur.

In Lucam. c. 12. in illa (quis me constituit judicem) docet ut singuli se
intra metas suas contineant neque res aggrediantur a sua vocatione alienas: He
speaks against Anabaptists of that time who preached without a calling.

The Reader may perceive that Bullinger, Gualther, and Musculus 1. Do
acknowledge, that the place Mat. 18. and 1 Cor. 5. do clearly prove an
Ecclesiastical excommunication, which Erastus denies. 2. That Erastus
expounds these two places against the Bullinger Gualther and others differ
much from Erastus.
mind of those his friends: And never Divine in the world, Protestant, Papist,
Lutheran, never Council, Father, Doctor, Ancient, or Modern, expounded the
place Let him be to thee as a Heathen, as Erastus does. 3. These Divines
difference the Magistrate and the Church, in censures, power, function. Erastus
confounds them, and says as the Anabaptists of old did; against whom,
Luther, Bullinger, Gualther, Lavater, Musculus, Wolfius, Aretius, Simlerus,
disputed, that the civil Magistrate may lawfully dispense the Word and
Sacraments. 4. They never condemned the Discipline of Geneva; Erastus does. 5.
They acknowledge there was in the apostolic Church, an Ecclesiastical Senate
or Presbytery: Erastus says, this is a devise wanting Scripture. 6. They
denied Excommunication to be exercised by all the Church, as a devise of the
Anabaptists: Bullinger says, 1 Cor. 5. a dilectis ad hoc hominibus. Erastus
says, it must be exercised by the whole Church, if there be any such thing. 7.
Bullinger and Gualther, think that Discipline is necessary in the Church:
Erastus refuses any such thing.

2. Bullinger and Gualther do think, that the Lords Supper, which is an action
of public thanksgiving and communion, should not be turned into a punishment,
which is a Use that Christ and his Gual. in Ep. ad Theod. Bezam an caena a.
inservire debeat excommunicationi, atque adeo in alium usum converti, quam qui
nobis a Christo monstratus, and ab apostolis traditus est.
Apostles has not taught us: But this is easily answered, 1. The pearls and
holy things of the Gospel are not turned into another Use then Christ has
ordained; because they are denied to dogs and swine as a punishment of their
swinish disposition; and if these pearls were given to swine, should they not
be turned to another Use then is ordained by Christ? Is not the union of
members in a Church-body a sweet bound? is this communion translated to a
bastard end, unknown to Christ and the Apostles? because the incestuous man is
cast out of that Communion? This is as who would say, the Table of the House is
a symbol of a sweet Communion of all the children of the House; Ergo, the Table
is turned from its native Use, and is abused, if a flagitious and wicked son be
turned out at the doors and removed from the Table. I think the contrary is
true; the Lords Table ordained for children, is converted into an Use not known
to Christ and his Apostles, when the Table is prepared for dogs and swine; and
this argument is against Christ, Mat. 7. as much as against us. 2. By this the
excommunicated cast out of the House, is not debarred from the Table of the
House. What sense is here? the offender is cast out from amongst the children
of the Lords family, and yet is admitted to the Table of the family?

3. These great Divines teach, that in the days of Christ and the Apostles,
there was such an ordinance as excommunication, and that the Church who works
not miracles, for any thing that we read, and received a precept from the Holy
Ghost for Excommunication, as a moral and perpetual mean to remove scandals, to
The Christian Magistrate cannot supply the place of Excommunication.
humble and shame an obstinate offender, to preserve the Church from contagion,
and to edify all, as is clear, Mat. 18. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. 1 Cor. 5. 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6. 2 These. 3. 14, 15. Romans 16. 17. 2 Cor. 10. 8. that the Church (I say)
or men must be wiser then Christ, and remove this mean of edification, and
substitute the sword of the Magistrate that has no activity or intrinsecal
influence for such a supernatural end as edification: this cannot but be a
condemning of the lawgiver Christ's wisdom. Whereas Mr. Prinne and others say,
that by the preaching of the Word, not by Church Discipline, men are converted
to Christ, as witness the many thousands of godly people in England where
there have been no government, but prelatical: I answer* 1. This is to dispute
against the wisdom of Christ who ascribes to private rebukes and Church
censures, the gaining of souls, the saving of the spirit, repentance, and
humiliation, Mat. 18. 15, 16. 1 Cor. 5. 5, 6. 2 Cor. 2. 6, 7, 8, 9. 2 These. 3.
14, 15. Romans 16. 17. 2 Cor. 10. 8. because preaching is more effectual; Ergo,
is the Discipline not effectual? 2. Consider if thousands more would not have
been converted if Christ's Government had been set up for which Mr. Cartwright,
Mr. Vdal, Mr. Dearing, and the godliest did supplicate the Parliament. 3.
Consider if there has not been in Scotland as many thousands, comparing the
numbers rightly, when the Church was terrible as an Army with Banners. 4.
Consider how the Tigurine Churches and others, for want of the hedge, have been
scandalously wicked. 5. The Magistrate by punishing drunkenness, or
fornication or extortion (for he cannot take away the life for these) does not
keep the lump of the whole Church from being leavened and infected with the
contagion of such: The Church by removing and casting out such an one, must do
that; and the personal separating from such as walk inordinately, cannot be an
act of the Magistrate, and yet cannot but be a perpetual and moral mean or
ordinance that the Church is to use, not only when they have not a Christian
Magistrate, but perpetually; for we are to withdraw from those that walk
inordinately, and are not to be corrupted with having entire fellowship with
wicked men, whether the Church have a Christian Magistrate or no: I am to gain
my brother by rebuking, and by telling the Church, and to esteem one that
hears not the Church, as an Heathen, or a Publican, that I may gain him:
Whether there be a Christian or an Heathen Magistrate in the Church, except it
can be proved, that the Magistrate as the Magistrate, is to gain souls to God:
Yea, Musculus, Bullinger, and Gualther, have alike reason to say, there is no
need that we rebuke privately a trespasing brother, and that we forgive him
seven times a day, when the Church has a Christian Magistrate, as they can say
there is no need of Excommunication: for if the sword can supply the room of
one spiritual ordinance of God, why not of another also? and the text will bear
us out as well to say, we are not to eschew the company of a scandalous
brother, for shaming of him, and for the danger of being leavened by him,
because the Magistrates sword may supply the want of that mean of edifying, as
well as it may supply the want of Excommunication: Yea, they may say there is
no need of public rebukes by the Word, the sword may supply these also. C. 18.

Amongst our late writers, I should conceive that renowned Cl. Salmasi. de
primatu papae, Part, 1. in apparatu, page 288. 289. Hyeronicus Monstra mihi

Salmasius, that rich treasure of Antiquity, can stand as one for all to speak
for us in this point. The Emperors (says he) had of old a suffrage in choosing
of Metropolitans, Patriarchs, and Popes, and of convocating General Councels:
So as Jerome makes it a Mark of a General Council, that it was indicted by the
Emperor; and there was reason, because, it concerned the consciences of the
Magistrate as the Magistrate, what Pastors, Popes, and Doctors there were in
their dominions to watch over their souls, and the souls of their subjects. It
is true, de facto, Honorius the Emperor did ordain Marcellinus moderator of
the conference at Carthage between the Catholics and the Donatists, The
Emperors added the force of a civil Law to the Councels: So Justinian.
Constitut. 130. sanxit ut quatuor conciliorum Canone^ pro legibus haberentur;
Ergo, the Councels had the force of Ecclesiastical Laws, without the
Emperors; But they had not the force of civil Laws, having civil penalties
annexed to them, without the Emperors; Ergo, the confirmation of Councels made
by the Emperors, were politic and civil confirmations: for the decrees of the
Council of Jerusalem, were Ecclesiastical decrees, without the will, Law, and
Authority of any Emperor on earth, and laid an Ecclesiastical tie on the
Churches, without the Emperor, Act. 16. 4, 5. So is that of Salmasius to be
expounded, as he expounds himself. Salmasius in apparatu, page 292.
Principis est leges de Religione condere, de fide Catholica, de Episcopis, de
Clericis, deque aliis huiusmodi que externam potestatem spectant, five (...)
circa res et personas Ecclesiasticas, eaque fecere Christiani Imperatores in
Ecclesia sui temporis, haeo enim est (...) sive (...) potestas qua principles
legum sanctionibus non uni generi sibi subditorum consulere debent, sed in
universum, omnibus tam laicis, quam Ecclesiasticis, quatenus Ecclesia est in
Repub. et Reip. pars, non Respublica Ecclesiae.

Now that Emperors appointed time and place of Synods, which were external
circumstances, is clear: But that the Emperors nominated the persons, who
should come, appointed an Ecclesiastical president in the Synod to moderate,
and that they defined the number of Bishops, is denied: Except 1. That they did
this in a great schism, and when the Church could not agree amongst
themselves: Or 2. In such a general defection, as was under Arrius, which was
an extraordinary case. 3. That the Emperor requested by Letters, that such and
such godly Bishops ^ight come to the Synod, not such: But whereas, d^ facto, he
as a Magistrate commanded such to come, and did discharge others under pains to
come (except they were other ways incarcerated and known parties, and so could
not be judges) is against the liberty of the Church and the freedom of Synods.

So Salmasius, Non igitur leges tantum facere d^ religione ac fide In ap^^^atu
page 293. 294.
omnibus observandas, dummodo verbo divino rei contraveniant, potest princeps
Christianus, vel summus Magistratus, sed etiam suos subditos ad decreta
Synodalia observanda quae verbo Dei conformia sunt, obligare, et Cogere:
ubicunque sane imperio opus est per vim agente ac jubente, aut jurisdictione
cogent^^, et ^^er^e^te, nihil istic habent qu^d agant verbi Ministri, neque jus
agendi ullum, etiamsi de re aut persona Ecclesiastica questi^ sit, aut de
religione agatur, sed ad principes aut Magistratus ea vis coactiva oe illud jus
imperativum et co^^^ivum pertinet.

There is a Law making (unproper I grant, because declarative in Mortal men,
constitutive in the head Christ only) touching Faith and Religion which is
politic; but it is when there is a constitu^e Church, subsequent, not
antecedent, and in order to bodily coaction by the sword which is due to the
Magistrate* O^ this Lawgiving does Salmasius speak as his words clear, and
because bodily and external co-action is not the Churches, therefore the
Magistrate as the Magistrate according to Salmasius, has no proper
Ecclesiastic power.

The reciprecation of subordination of Pastors and Magistrates In appar. p. 298.
is clearly taught by Salmasius Minister, Ecclesiae principem Christianum
ligare et solvere id est, suspendere et excommunicare aque potest ut alium quem
libet de grege per illam internam potestatem et (...) quam a deo acc^pit. At
princeps rursus potest Episcopum per illam suam exteriorem (...), quae no^
animam, sed corpus curat, cogere, coercere, ad officium comp^^^ere, si
exorbitet, etiam deponere, et abijcere, et exilio punire, vita quoq^^, si
meruerit, s^nt^ntiam, dicere, privare -- a principe abjectus Episcopus
Ministerij tantum atque officij functionem amittit, atque exercitium intra
limits jurisdictionis duntaxatvel ditionis quae principi subjecta est -- at
non potestatem, quam in ordinatione accepit, per impositionem manuum, potest
eripere princeps, cum nec eam possit dare.

Cum sit duplex potestas Ecclesiastica, altera interna, externa altera, tam
peccant qui utramque principi vel Magistratui civili tribunt, quam qui utramque
denegant ministro Ecclesiastico. And he proves that the Pastors have received
immediately from Christ, and not from the Magistaate, their internal and
external power of governing the Churches.

Hence it is clear that Simler, Lavater, and Wolphius, do clearly 1. Difference
between the two powers of the Sword and Church. 2. That the Priests in the Old,
and Ministers in the New Testament are not to profane holy things. 3. That by
Assemblies and Synods Church Censures are to be dispensed.

The mind of D. Pareus and P. Martyr may be known by what is said, and is
cleared in that learned dissertation of Iac. Trig. Nor shall I need to burden
the Reader with citations of Fathers, Greek and Latin, Doctors, Councels, with
all our Protestant Divines, Luther, Calvin, Beza, Farel, Marlorat, Piscator,
Sibrandas, Iunius, Gomaras, Trelcatius, Bucanus, etc. which were easy to do if
not needless, and acknowledged by the Adversary. I have also in answering
Erastus (I hope) answered all that Mr. Prinne has said, either in his
questions, or vindication; because most of all he has (I speak it not to
diminish or detract from the learning of that reverend man, ^^r ^^sse to
irritate) is fully to be seen in Erastus: so that in answering Erastus, I hope,
that ingenuous, zealous, and learned Divine will Acquiesce. The Lord establish
Jerusalem and make her a peaceable habitation.

FINIS.
AN INTRODVCTION To the Doctrine of Scandal.
Whether or no things indifferent can be commanded because indifferent?

WHat ever things are commanded under the tenor of things indifferent, and yet
are not indifferent, are not lawful, nor can be in reason commanded: for so
should they be of their nature both indifferent, and not indifferent: But
humane Ceremonies are sush; Ergo, they are not lawful.

Indifferent things Basilius calls them (...) Nazianz. (...); so Laertius,
and Gellius says the same of them. Things indifferent cannot be good, but
essentially neither good nor ill, and if they be not good, they cannot be apt
to edify, and so fall not within the compass of things which can be commanded
by Rulers.

There is a twofold matter of a Church constitution, the one remote, the other
nearer: The remote matter of Church constitutions are things indifferent, to
wit, men's actions and the circumstances thereof; and so they are the matter of
Gods Laws; for all our actions Physically considered to know, believe, will,
love, joy, fear, speak, walk, Course of conformity page 115. Indifferent things
as such not the matter of a Churrh constitution.
laugh, etc* are indifferent in themselves* but God in the Law of Natu^^* and
his positiv^ Div^^^ Law ^^th (...)d^ ^^^m ^^^d (...)i^ (...) put ^is d(...)
^^gal upon th^^* (...) a^ it is such, can be the nearest matter of any
Church-constitution: No wise man would say that the Church might make a Law,
that all should cast stones in the water; yet* God might make a Law thereof.
For what actions has no good, nor lawfulness, nor aptitude to edisie in
themselves, these the will of man can never make good, lawful, and apt to
edify, because only God, whose will is the prime rule of all goodness, can
create moral goodness in actions: not to eat of the fruit of the tree of
knowledge, is only good, because God has so appointed in his Law* and to eat
of the fruit of that tree, had been as lawful and just, as not to ^a^^, if God
had commanded eating thereof, under ^r^mises and threatenings* 6. Hence ^^
follows that all actions and circumstances of their nature indifferent, must
lose that indifferency, and receive from God some goodness, and aptness to
edify, before they can be the reasonable and nearest matter of any Civil or
Ecclesiastical constitution; because what rulers can in Law and reason command,
that they must will as good and apt to edify* before they can bind others to
will it. But neither the will of a ruler* nor the will of any other can
lawfully will a thing indifferent, as it is such: for a thing indifferent as it
is such, is neither good nor evil, and the object of the will is always good.
3. Rulers commands as Gods Ministers for our good, Romans 13. 4. Ergo, the
means and actions enjoined for the compassing of this end must be good, for if
the end be good, the means as the means must be good; Ergo, they cannot be
indifferent.

Things indifferent cannot be enacted as a L^w, except they were indifferent to
all, to both weak and wilful; for remaining evil to some they are scandalous,
and cannot be commanded, except rulers would command sinful actions.

The Apostles would make no Laws at all of things indifferent, except in the
case of scandal, neither can our Ceremonies be indifferent. 1. Because they are
sacred mystical signs teaching us some duties to God. 2. They are worship, and
means tending to the honor of God, and being used for the honor of an Idol,
as they are used by us, they should be the religious honor of an Idol. 3. They
are pretended to be means apt to edify. Ergo, They are not in their use
indifferent. 4. The use of Ceremonies are Moral actions of man, not warranted
by Gods Word. Ergo, They are unlawful, and so not indifferent. If then nothing
be good, because Rulers command it; but, by the contrary, they do lawfully
command it, because it is good. The Churches power, is one and the same, in
things indifferent, and necessary in matters of Doctrine, Discipline, and
Order; for in both, the Church does not create goodness, but does by the Light
of the Word, or (which is a part of the Word) by natures Light, find
pre-existent goodness in Doctrine, Discipline, and matters of Order. Therefore
Will of Authority, as Will, has no power to dispose of the least Circumstance
of time, place or person; but the Churches power is Ministerial, and determined
to what is good, expedient, and convenient.

Object. Humane Actions according to their specifice nature may be indifferent
Doct. For^. in Ireni. l. 1. c. 12. number. 13.
in Gods Worship: For example, to pray to God in the morning, in your Bed, or
out of it; in the House, or in the Fields; to Preach the Word in thi^, or that
habit, in a Gown, or in a Cloak; these are actions in their kind indifferent,
because they are neither commanded, nor forbidden; for that is according to the
kind of action good, which is so commanded of God, that it is unlawful to
neglect it, or to do any thing repugnant to it, as to love God and our
Neighbor; and that is evil according to its kind, which is so forbidden by
Gods Law, as it is not lawful to do it, or command it in any sort; so it is
evil to blaspheme God, to commit adultery. So Forbs.

Ans. In the Field, or in the Bed, Clothed with Gown or Cloak, when Actions
are not indifferent, because their circumstances are indifferent.
we Pray or Preach, are mere Accidents and Circumstances of praying and
preaching, and we grant them to be variable and indifferent; howbeit, they
admit of Regulation Moral, and so are not simply indifferent; for to pray in
the Fields and Streets, to be seen of men, is vain glory. But I hope they are
not indifferent in your meaning, as are Surplice, Holydays, etc. For you will
not say the Church may make Laws that no Prayers be but in the Fields, no
Preaching except the Preacher be clothed with a Cloak. 2. It is not good
Logic to say, `To pray in House or Field, is an action according to its kind,
neither good nor evil; when as it is an individual action, contracted to such a
place, House or Field, because Field or House are indifferent in Prayer. To
pray is not indifferent according to its kind; because Accidents of Actions
are indifferent; it follows not that the action is indifferent, for then the
Doctors Opinion, makes an Act of loving God, and believing in Christ,
indifferent in its kind; for it is as indifferent to love God in the Field, as
in the House, and to love him while you are clothed with a Gown, as with a
Cloak: As it is indifferent to pray, in House or Field, clothed with Gown, or
Cloak; so to love God, and the most necessary actions in the world hic and
nunc, in this time or in this place, shall be actions according to their
nature, neither good, nor evil, but indifferent, which is against the Doctors
own Distinction. 3. Place or habit does not constitute Praying, and Preaching
in their specifice nature; that were a wonder; for their Objects do constitute
their nature, and their Objects are God and Gods Word; and if they be
indifferent according to their nature, it shall be indifferent to pray to God,
or to some other thing, possibly an Idol. Nay, if Actions good of their own
nature, such as to Pray, or Preach, be made indifferent according to their
kind, because clothed with indifferent Circumstances of time and place, and
habit; then by that same reason, Actions of their own nature evil, as to
murder, commit adultery, should also become indifferent, from these
Circumstances; then should it be indifferent to kill in House, or Field, and
indifferent according to its kind, which is most absurd.

Object. Howbeit it be objected, that every voluntary action is either honest,
or D. Forbesius in Irenic. l. 1. cap. 1. 3. fig. 15.
not honest, yet there are some things honest, that are indifferent and free*
For there are two kinds of honest things, 1. Some honest and necessary things,
as all the duties commanded in Gods Law, the contrary of these polluteth a man
before God, and they are formally, positively, and inclusively laudable, and
commends men before God, and are rewarded. This way every voluntary action is
not either honest, or unhonest; for there is a middle betwixt these two, to
wit, something honest and lawful, but not necessary, but morally free, as
Marriage, which commends not a man to God, so that he is therefore rewarded;
neither does the contrary, to wit, non-marriage pollute a man before God, or is
blameworthy, because marriage is only negatively honest, Honestum
irreprchensibile, honestum exclusive, and honestum per compossibilitatem cum
honesto formali and positivo. So marriage is neither positively honest, nor
unhonest, but free morally. Neither is marriage necessary by absolute
necessity, or necessity that touches the action; for men may marry, and not to
marry is no sin, only marrying is necessary by a conditional necessity, 1 Cor.
7. 39. A Widow is free to marry whom she will, but with this condition, That
she marry in the Lord; the necessity touches not the action, but the manner of
the action. And this necessity of the manner or goodness of the action of
marriage, does not make the action necessary, but leaves it as free to men to
marry, or not to marry; and so there are some actions according to the spece or
nature, that are indifferent, and not unhonest, yet lawful. So Doctor Forbs.

Answ. 1. Marriage has something in it natural, even before the Fall. It was
naturally good, that man should not be alone, and this way, Marrying not
indifferent, as the Doctor supposes.
before, and after the Fall, Marriage in the ground that makes it necessary,
which is an aptitude and inclination to procreation, is most necessary; and so
now, after the Fall of man, all that burns and marr^e^h not, despises Gods
remedy of lust, and sins; and so by necessity of Gods command in the Law of
nature, and repeated by the Apostle, 1 Cor. 7. 2, 9. it is necessary in
individuo: And although, that which is merely natural in marriage, as the Act
of marriage according to the substance, be not formally laudable, and rewarded,
because of the naturality thereof; yet it is not for that free or indifferent.
2. And when the Doctor says, That marriage is indifferent in its nature* and
free; so that there is no necessity of the action, but only of the goodness
of the action, he speaks wonders: For howbeit, marriage be indifferent by a
Metaphysical Indifference Metaphysical and Theological.
indifferency of contrahibility to such and such persons, because marriage may
be in some, without sin, and no marriage may also be in other some, without
sin; and so praying is indifferent; it is in some without sin, and not praying
is in some also without sin, when the man is necessitated to some other action,
either Civil, Natural or Supernatural; yet marriage is not Morally or
Theologically indifferent: So as to marry, or not marry, is a matter of a man's
free choice, and of his own free* will not obnoxious to any binding Law, as is
kneeling, not-kneeling, crossing, not-crossing, in the mind of our
Adversaries. 1. If it were morally indifferent to marry, or not to marry,
Rulers might make Laws either commanding all to marry, or none to marry, or
some to marry; some not to marry, which were no small tyranny, and the very
doctrine of Devils. 2. The gift of Continency, is to some a commandment of God,
that they marry not, and burning is to some a commandment, obliging them in
conscience to marry, else they sin; therefore to marry, or not to marry, is
necessary to all men, or then unlawful, and so not indifferent, as our Divines
teach against Papists, their Supererogatorie Works. The Lords calling of any to
suffer for his Truth* is instead of a command of God; though the man might be
saved, though he suffer not for the Truth. 3. If there be no necessity in
marrying, but only conditional in the manner o^ marrying, then all mankind
without sin might abstain from marrying, which it most absurd. 4. The place 1
Cor. 7. 39. says not, that a Widow is under no necessity of marrying, but
only under a necessity of well and spiritual marrying. For the liberty that
the Widow has there, is not, that it is indifferent to her to marry, or not to
marry; for since our Adversaries teach, That Rulers may make Laws in things
indifferent; they might then make a Law that no Widows shall marry, which were
vile tyranny. But the liberty that the Widow has to marry whom she will, is
opposed only to a Law and Obligation Matrimonial, that she was under, while
her Husband did live. And the words clearly speaks only of thi^ freedom, not
of Moral freedom of indifference, from all Law of God necessitating her to
marry: The Wise is bound by the Law, as long as her Husband lives; but if her
Husband be dead, she is at liberty to marry whom she will, only in the Lord.
But there are no small odds betwixt liberty to marry this or that man, because
the Husband is dead, of which liberty only the Apostle speaks; and liberty,
and indifference without all restraint of Gods Law to marry at all, or not to
marry: This latter liberty, the Scripture speaks not of, only the Doctor
alleges it.

Object. Kneeling at the Sacrament, howbeit, antecedente and immediately it be

necessary by Gods Law; yet consequently, and by the mediation of lawful
Authority, it is now necessary to us, not by necessity of the thing it self,
but by necessity of obedience, order, and peace; and so according to the
practice, it is for the time necessary by Gods Law, and cannot be omitted
without sin. So Forbes.

Answ. Necessity of obeying the Church can make nothing necessary Necessity of
obeying the Church, in things only necessary for the Churches Commandment, is
neither a lawful, nor an obliging necessity.
and good, for the Church commands it, because it is necessary and good, and
it has not goodness, necessity and aptness to edify from men's will, and
the Churches commandment. 2. I ask if no kneeling, now in Scotland laying aside
the respect of Authority and Law, be in it self undecent, and unapt to edify;
if not, then the Church has no more ground and reason for order and decency in
our Ceremonies (for what I say of one, holds true in all) then there is for
the want of Ceremonies; and if that be true, the sole will and lust of
Authority makes our Ceremonies lawful: What can Romish impudence give more to
the Man of sin? But if there be unorderlinesse and indecency in our Ceremonies,
then kneeling now must be sin, even laying aside the respect of Humane Laws. 3.
It is strange Divinity, That that which is no sin, of it self, cannot be
omitted without sin, for the sole will and pleasure of men. Humane Authority
then may make it sin, not to rub our Beards, not to claw our Heads, when we
come to the Church to hear Gods Word. If Humane Authority can make an
indifferent Act lawful, and the omission of it, sinful; they may make all the
indifferent Acts in the World lawful Acts, they might then make piping,
leaping, laughing Acts o^ Divine Worship, and might make a Decalogue of their
own: And if they may make an indifferent Act to be sin, if it be omitted, they
may by as good reason, make sinful Acts, as Adultery, Incest, Murder,
Robbery, to be lawful Acts; For if man's inhibiting will be the formal reason of
sin, then his commanding will must be the formal reason of obedience: And so
Rulers might command Murder, Robbery, Incest, Blasphemy.

Object. We may perform an individual act coming from deliberate will, and that
Doctor Ferbes.
without sin, and we may omit the same without sin: Whether we practice these
indifferent actions, or omit them, we should refer both practice and omission
to Gods glory; and these actions we call indifferent or free, (as indifferent
and free is opposed to that which is morally necessary) which are either
necessary to be done, or necessary to be omitted, by necessity of a Divine Law*
Howbeit, every action that is not of Faith be sin, Romans 14. 23. Yet the faith
whereby I believe this action is necessary, and must be done, is not necessary
to the eschewing of sin. But if I do it, that I do it in Faith, and for Gods
glory, is necessary; but the necessity of the goodness of the action does not
make the action necessary; for it were to lay a yoke of continual doubting upon
men's conscience, if they should believe every individual act, that they do, to
be necessary; for whether should they turn them, while they think of doing, or
not doing these actions, that they know to be commanded by no Word of God? That
a Widow marry in the Lord, if she marry, is necessary; but it is not necessary,
that she marry, but it is indifferent to her, to marry, or not to marry. Doctor
Forbes.

Answ. It is a contradiction, that an action individual, should be indifferent,
Actions individual merely indifferent, cannot be done in Faith.
and so neither good, nor evil, and yet done in Faith, and referred to Gods
glory: For the ground of doing, which is Faith, and the end, which is Gods
glory, are individual properties necessarily concurring to the individuation of
the Action Moral. 2. An action individual, that is merely indifferent, and so
without sin may be performed, without sin, or omitted without sin, cannot be an
action of Faith referred to Gods glory: For what may be done without sin, and
may not be done without sin, is a will-action, and wants all necessity of
reason, and so is an idle and sinful action; but a sinful action may be done in
fancy, but in Faith it cannot be done; it may, in the vain intention of the
doer, be referred to Gods glory, In intention erronea operantis, but ex
condition operis, according to the nature of the work it serves not for Gods
glory. This way to cast stones in the water, should be of Faith, and referred
to Gods glory: But shall I believe I am doing in Faith, and glorifying God,
when I am casting stones in the water, and I have as good reason not to cast at
all? If one wilaction that may be done, and may not be done, may be of Faith,
and referred to Gods glory, then may they all be of Faith, and referred to Gods
glory: This is a laughter, rather then Divinity. 3. I cannot believe that an
action that has as good reason to be omitted, as to be done, can be acceptable
to God, because I have no ground for my Faith; for my Faith here leans
neither on Scripture, nor on Reason, but there is no reason why the action
should rather be, nor not be, because it is indifferent; yea, crossing and
kneeling of themselves shall be of Faith, because I believe them to be of
Faith: But it is a vain thing to say, that Faith makes its object. 4. There
are no actions in the World, but they have all their Moral necessity from
their intrinsecal goodness: For from whence is it necessary to love God, but
from the intrinsecal goodness, that the love of God has from Gods command?
For there is no necessity an action to be at all; yea, it is idle and
superfluous, if there be no goodness in it at all. If then crossing and
kneeling, (laying aside the respect of Humane Laws commanding them) have no
necessity Moral, from any Commandment of God, why they should be at all, their
necessity must be all from man's will: this is tyranny in Rulers, for their
sole pleasure to command, under the heaviest pain, things that have no
necessity at all, but their will. 5. Neither is it any yoke to men's
conscience, to square all their Moral Action by Gods Word, and so to see
(according as it is Written) before they vanture upon any Action Moral. It is
liberty to keep Gods way accuratel.

Object. In general, no particular action is necessary, the goodness whereof
that Doct. Forbes. Iren* ^. ^ c. 13. hg. 11.
is commended and rewarded of God, may ^s well be had by the omission of that
action, or by an other action, as by the doing of it; but such an action in the
individual use is true, and indifferent; but i^ the goodness necessary cannot
be had at all, without that particular action, then the action in the
individual use is necessary, although according to its nature, it be possibly
indifferent. So to us now to kneel at the Supper, is necessary, that we may
obtain the necessary good of due Obedience, and decent Uniformity, and eschew
the contempt of Anthority, Schism, and Confusion. Forb^.

Answ. 1. By goodness here, the Doctor means, Concomitant and general
goodness, which makes not the action necessary to be done, and so it has no
goodness intrinsecal, but is an idle action, and yet it may be done, or not
done without sin; and when it is done, it is done upon no other motive, but the
mere will and pleasure of the doer: We have hereby the Doctors learning, Such
an idle action done in Faith, and done for Gods glory. 2. All our Ceremonies in
their use, crossing, kneeling, wearing of Surplice, have no intrinsecal
goodness, no internal moral equity of Order, Decency, and aptness to Edify,
wherefore it is necessary they should be done; the doing of them in Faith, and
for Gods glory, may be obtained as well by no^^-kneeling, none-crossing,
none-Surplice. This is no small dash to the credit of Pearth Assembly; for they
saw no goodness in the Articles, but that which as well might have been
obtained without them. Hence except the goodness of pleasing King James, they
had no more reason for the Ceremonies, then to make an Act that all Ministers
shall go to the Football, the third day of May. 3. Then the mere pleasure of
the King has made kneeling necessary; and good obedience to the fifth
Commandment, men's will as will so is the only formal reason of obedience to
the ten Commandments, or disobedience. 4. Then we may of Faith, and for Gods
glory, refuse the Ceremonies, if it be the Kings Will; and in that point, the
fifth Commandment stands or falls at the nod of the Kings Will. Such
Mercenary Divinity becomes not the lovers of Reformation.

Object. There is a twofold maline in actions, One thar lays a moral
impediment Doct. Forbes.
on the act, so that it cannot be performed without sin: So to eschew the
malice that is in adultery, we must eschew the act of adultery; this malice
polluteth the act, and should binder the act: There is another malice that
polluteth the act, but does not morally hinder the act, As when one feeds the
poor for vainglory, vain glory polluteth the act, but hinders it not:
Vainglory should be laid aside, and the poor fed. If one kneel at the Supper,
thinking it not lawful to kneel before Creatures, his kneeling is evil; but the
evil in it does only pollute the act, and make it finful, but does not morally
hinder kneeling, because contumacio^s ignorance, pride, and contempt of
Authority should be laid aside: Men should be docil, Forbes. ib. n. 13. The
unlawfulness even inseparably adhering toactions that are indifferent, makes
them unlawful.
and see the law fullness of it, and obey the Church. Forbs.

Answ. In things indifferent, the very malice adhering to the practice of them,
howbeit, it adhere not inseparably to them, makes the practice damnable: For
eating Romans 14. before a weak Brother, whose weakness might have been removed,
if he would be docil, and know that their is no creature now unclean, is
murder, Romans 14. 14. Therefore, suppose all the Kings and General Assemblies
on Earth, should command one to eat in that case, before the weak Brother, they
were to be disobeyed; and so the Doctor freeth us, that we cannot kneel at the
Lords Supper. 2. Rulers may not make laws of things having no necessity of
Goodness, Decency, and aptness to Edify, and only good, because they will,
when they see of necessity, these laws shall inevitably ruin many souls; for
that is to have more regard to their own will, then to the salvation of peoples
souls, whereas even Christ pleased not himself. 3. Many weak are incapable of
all Reasons or Arguments that can free our kneeling of Idolatry. Ergo, They
should abstain, and not kneel with a doubting conscience; better not eat as
eat, with a doubting conscience, Romans 14 23. 4. Pride and contempt are only
seen to God: Prelates have no place to punish heart-acts, they are to prove by
two Witnesses, the Malice, and Pride, and Contempt of Authority; but this is
invisible to men's eyes, refusal of obedience to Canons touching indifferent
things, the necessity whereof (as the Doctor must say) comes only from man's
will, cannot be contempt: The neglect of a command of God, is indeed a virtual
contempt of the Majesty, Authority, Power, and Justice of God, because a
command of God has Essentially, Equity, and Justice in it, from Gods
commanding Will: But a command of a thing indifferent, that may as well,
without sin be left undone, as done, (as our Doctor says of our Ceremonies)
can never have equity or goodness from Humane Authority; and I never contemn
Humane Authoriti^, except I contemn the just Laws made by Humane Authority

Aquinas 22. q. 168. art. 9. 3. Contemnere est nolle subjici legi ex superbia.
.

Object. Of things alike lawful and convenient; for example, sitting at the
Lords Table, or not sitting, we are bound to the one rather then to the other,
for lawful Authorities command; for convenience and goodness in external
circunistances stands not in such an indivisible point, but there may be
circumstances good, better, and best; a gesture, a day, a habit, may be so good
and convenient, as another gesture, another day, another habit, are as good and
convenient* in which case, either no habit, no day, no gesture at all, shall be
in Gods Worship, which were impossible; else of two Circumstances, both of
three degrees of goodness, one shall be chosen by the sole Will of Authority;
and so people must follow one order, rather then another as good, for the sole
Will of Authority, without any prevalent reason in the thing commanded.

Answ. 1. In such a case as that, where two Circumstances, both of three
degrees of How exsuperancy of necessity of goodness is to sway the will of
Rulers and people.
goodness occurreth, Rulers can reasonably tie people to neither, but leave it
alternatively, to their liberty; for why should liberty be restrained, where
necessity of order, and deceney, does not necessitate the Rulers will? 2. In
such a case the Rulers will, as will, should not be the formal cause, why one
is enacted rather then another; but the Rulers will led by a reason from
convenience, and so there were a prevalent reason, for the one rather then the
other. 3. I deny that such a Metaphysical case of two things every way of alike
convenience can fall out, as the matter of a grave and weighty
Church-constitution; For natures Light, rules of Prudence, Pretty, Charity, and
Sobriety shall ever find out, and discover an exsuperancy of goodness and
convenience, of one above another. 4. Granting there be three degrees of*
goodness and convenience in fitting, and two degrees of goodness and
convenience in kneeling, in this case the object necessitateth the Rulers will
to command fitting, and refuse kneeling. 1. Because good being the formal
object of a reasonable Will, in both Rulers and people; that which partaketh
more of the nature of Good, is first to be chosen. Ergo, The Rulers will is
determinated and morally necessitated to a circumstance of three degrees,
before a circumstance of two degrees; and we obey for the goodness of the
thing commanded, and not for the will of the Rulers. 2. If people obey, and so
embrace a Circumstance of two degrees, and refuse a convenient circumstance of
three degrees; they either make this choice for the goodness and convenience
of the Circumstance, or for the mere Will of Authority; the former cannot be
said, because of two Goods, known to be so, the one of three degrees, and the
other of two degrees; the Will cannot reasonably choose the less good, because
a less good known as a less good, is evil, and the Will cannot reasonably
choose known evil: A less good is a good with a defect, and so morally evil;
if then Rulers cannot choose evil, they cannot reasonably command others to
choose it; if the latter be said, the choice of people is reasonlesse, and
their conscience rests upon the mere Will of* Authority, which is slavish
obedience. How are we then bidden, try all things? 1 These. 5. 21. 1 Ioh. 4. 1.


Object. In matters plainly determined by Scripture, Rulers are to follow the
Word of God; but in matters circumstantial or indifferent, where Scripture
says neither for the one side, nor for the other, what Rulers thinks good,
is to be followed, there being no evil nor impiety in that which they command.

Answ. 1. This is to make Rulers in matters of Salvation liable to the
Scriptures of God; The will of Rulers not a law to us in things indifferent.
but in matters which men call indifferent to make them Popes, and to hang our
consciences upon their sleeve, which is most absurd. 1. Because Paul in matters
most indifferent of days, and meats, would not have the Romans to hang upon
his judgment, but will rule both their practice, and his own, by the Law of
nature. Murder not, Scandalize not. 2. What Rulers thinks good is not a rule
for Constitutions, and for peoples obedience in matters circumstantial; but the
rule of Rulers here in making Laws, and of people in obeying Laws, is goodness
it self, Order, Decency, aptitude to Edify, in things that they command; for
it were strange, if in matters, that they call of salvation, not thoughts, but
the Word of God should rule and square Canon-makers, but in matters
indifferent, their thoughts should be a Law. 3. Scripture and the Law of
nature, and right reason, which is a deduction from Scripture, is able
sufficiently in all Canous and Constitutions to regulate both Rulers and
people, and to determine what is conventent in Circumstances; and the Lord here
is an infallible Judge, speaking in his Word, as he is in all matters, which
they call Fundamental; yea, the Scripture shall be imperfect in the duties of
the second Table, if it do not determine what is active scandal, or soul
murder, as it does determine what is Idolatry, what is lawful Worship.

A Dispute touching Scandal and Christian liberty.
Quest. I. Concerning Scandal.
Whether or not Ceremonies, and the use of things not necessary in Gods
worship, when they Scandalize, be unlawful?

I Do the more willingly enter this Dispute, and with reverence to the more
learned, shall examine the Doctrine of the late Doctors of Aberdene in their
Duplyes. Because I occasioned their thoughts touching Scandal, by a private
dispute of the nature of Scandal, which I undertook while I was confined in
Aberdene, with one of the chief Doctors.

Our 10 Argument. Ceremonies and things not necessary in Arg. 10.
Gods worship fail against Charity, by the grievous crime of Scandal.

The practice of things indifferent, and not necessary, is then unlawful,
when from thence arises the scandal or occasion of the ruin of ou^ Brother.

But from the practice of Ceremonies and things not necessary arises
Scandal, and occasion of the ruin of our brother. Ergo, the practice of such
is unlawful. Observe our Argument leans on a ground given, but not granted
that the Ceremonies be indifferent, though to us they be evil: I prove the
Proposition, 1 Romans 14. 14. I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that
nothing is unclean of it self; but to him that esteems anything unclean, to
him it is unclean. V. 15. But if thy brother be grieved (weakened in his
Christian race) Now walk thou uncharitably, destory not him with thy meat,
for whom Christ died. 20. For meat destroy not the work of God. Then for
crossing, kneeling, holy days, destroy not him for whom Christ died, 1 Cor. 8.
9. 1 Cor. 10. 28. So the brazen Serpent must be removed, when it is a
scandalous object of Idolatry, Ezra 8. 22. Ezra for fear of Scandal, will
not seek a band of men of the King, lest the King should believe the hand of
God would not be with his people, as he had said, Yet a band of men had been
more necessary then the Ceremonies. So 2 King. 23. 10 Josiah is commended for
defiling Tophet, to prevent occasion of offering Children to Molech: for this
cause God judges an house without Battlement, and the sending abroad a goaring
Ox to be murder, Deuteronomy. 27. 28. Exodus 22. 28. 29. 33. Exodus 23. ^. Deuteronomy. 7. 3.
and Levit. 19. 14. Thou shall not lay a stumbling block before the blind.
Marrying with the Canaanites was forbidden, for the ruin occasioned by that,
to the souls of Gods people. I prove the Assumption, Gretser in sum. cos.
conscient. q. 23. page 173 Calvinistae Catholicorum Sim^^.
Gretzer says, In Ceremonies Calvinists are the apes of Catholics. 2. If such
a worship had been in the Temple or Synagogue, so as the Jews in the same act
might, have worshipped Jehovah and the Canaanites Baall or Dagon, as at one
table the Papists may kneel and adore bread, with the Protestant, receiving
the Sacrament, it would be a reigning scandal. 3. Atheists have mocked
Religion, for the Surplice, and other Masse-toyes. 4. Papists say Protestants
are returning to their Mother Church of Rome* 5. We cannot in zeal preach
against Popish traditions, and practice Popish Ceremonies. 6. Lascivious
carousings, drunkenness, harlatrie, come from observing of holy days. That
this may be more clear. 1. The nature of a scandal would be cleared. 2, The
Doctrine of the Apostle Paul about Scandal proponed.

A Scandal is a word or action or the omission of both, inordinately spoken or
done, whence we know, or ought to know, the fall of weak, wilful or both, is
occasioned to th^se, who are within or without the Church. 1. It is a word or
deed seen to others* Sinful thoughts not being seen, are not public
scandalls, though to the man himself they occasion sin. Hence
non-conformitie simply to a thing indifferent, must only be scandalous, as
joined with contempt, formal contempt in things indifferent, is inward and
invisible to men. 2. Omission of words and deeds scandalize. Silence in
Preachers, when God* matters go wrong is scandalous: So Sanches Sanches in
Decal t^m. 1. lib. 1. c. 6. n. 1.
3. Not every word and deed does scandalize, but such as are done unorderly.
Sanches, ib.
Sanches says these words and deeds, Quae carent rectitudine, which want some
moral rectitude; o^ as Aquinas Aquinas 22 q 23 art 3. Quod de sui ratione
habet, quod sit inductivum ad peccandum, vel habet similitudinem peccati.
says, of themselves are inductive to sin, does scand^lize: or that
Spalatens. de rep. Ecclesiae, lib. 1. c. 11* n. 18.
M. Anton. De Dominis Archiep. Spalatens. says, which is indictive to sin,
or the cause of great evil, or hinders good, as our faith, zeal, love, etc.
that scundalizeth. For though none of these fall out, if the work or word, or
omission of either be such, as of it self, is apt to scandalize, it is an
active scandal. Hence every little scandal is a sin, either in it self, or
in the unordinate way of doing ^. But what objects are properly scandalous,
shall be discussed. 3. When we know such words and deeds do scandalize, and
they be not necessary to be done, yea, and if we ought to know; for though
the pronness and procliviti^ of our brethren, or others to sin, be in some
respect, question facti, yet is it also question juris, a question of Law, the
ignorance whereof condemns when the things themselves are doubtsomely evil,
but not necessary to be done; Hence the practice of a thing indifferent, when
there be none that probably can be scandalized, and has some necessity, is
lawful: as Colos. 2. 16. Let no man therefore judge you in meat ^r drink, etc.
yet in case of scandal it is unlawful to cat. See 1 Cor. 10. 27. Eat
whatsoever is set before you asking no question for conscience sake. 28. But if
any say, this is offered in sacrifice, to Idols, eat not for his sake who
shewedit, for conscience sake -- Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of
others. Therefore practicing of things indifferent, or non-practising, are both
lawful, according as persons are present who may be scandalized, or not
scandalized; but this is in things though in nature indifferent, yet in use
having some necessity, as eating of meats, but the case is otherwise in
things altogether indifferent, as our Ceremonies are, which are supponed to lay
no ty on the conscience, before God, o incline to either side, as they say, to
cross, or not to cross, laying aside the Commandment of men. For if
no-crossing be all is good, as crossing, then though there be non-scandalized,
yet because it is such an action in Gods worship, as is acknowledged to be
indifferent, and has appearance of adding to Gods word and worship, it is
inductive to sin, and scandalous, though none should hence be actu secundo,
ruinated, and made to stumble. But if any in Paul's time, as the case was, in
the Church of Corinth should eat meats at a table, forbidden in the Law, he
not knowing that a Jew was there, this may seem invincible ignorance, because
ignorance of a mere fact, not of a law, if that Jew should be scandalized
through his eating, it should seem to me, to be scandal taken, but not
culpably given. 4. It is said in the definition, That these inordinate words or
deeds occasioneth the fall of others. 1. Because the will of the scandalized,
or his ignorance is the efficacious and nearest cause, why he is scandalized,
that is, why he sins; actions or words are occasions only, or causes by
accident, for none ought to be scandalized, as none ought to sin, ad peccatum
nulla est obligati^. 2. Because, as to be scandalized is sin, so to
scandalize actively is sin, though actual scandal follow not, as Peter
scandalized Christ culpably, when he counseled him not to die for sinners,
though it was impossible that Christ could be scandalized* 5. It is said,
(whereby weak or wilful, within, or witho^t the Church may be scandalized)
For I hope to prove that it is no less sin actively to scandalize the
wilful, and malicious, then the weak, though there be degrees of sinning here,
and we must eschew things scandalous for their sake who are without the Church.

For the Second I set down these Propositions 1. from Romans 14.

1. Proposit. The weak are not to be thraled in judgment, or practice in
thornie and intricate disputes, in matters indifferent. This is clear Romans 14.
v. 1. Ergo When people know not mistie distinctions of relative and absolute
adoration, of worship essential or accidental, they are not to be here
thraled by a Law to practice Ceremonies humane.

2 Proposit. If a weak one eat herbs, fearing the practice of things forbidden
by Gods law, he is commended, and his abstinence praiseworthy, as Romans 14. v.
2. 3. and he ought not to be judged, and so ought not to be a wed by a Law.
Then abstinence and non-conformitie is lawful in such a case.

3. Proposit. He that eats, he that eats not; he that practices, he that
practices not indifferent things, is not to be judged. 1. God has received
the eater. 2. You are not to judge another man's servant. It is against the Law
of Nations. 3. If the weak fall, God is able to raise them. Ergo, if he be not
to be judged, as a contemner of Gods law in things indifferent, far less
should he be judged, by the Church law.

4. Proposit. Observers of days, or non-observers of days should have
certainty of Faith in these indifferent things; Ergo, the light of the Word
should lead Rulers, and People here, v. 5. in things indifferent.

5. Proposit. The observer of indifferent things, as days in that case at
Rome, and the non-observers of days should not trouble one another* because
both are to observe, and not observe indifferent things, for Gods glory. 1.
Both gives thanks. 2. Both lives and dies as Christ's, for Gods glory. 6. 7.
8. 9. Therefore Gods glory is the end that rules the use of Ceremonies, as
they are indifferent.

Proposit. 6. v. 10. 11. 12. a Christian should not condemn a Jew* no^ one
brother another, in things indifferent. 1. Because we are brethren. 2. Because
it is Christ's place to judge; and condemn. 3. Because every man must give an
account for himself. Ergo. Laws of Rulers to condemn or punish, are not to be
made in such cases.

Proposit. 7. v. 13. When the use of things indifferent is a stumbling block
and scandal to our brethren they are against charity and unlawful.

Proposit. 8. v. 14. there is a Prolepsis. Meats clean, or not clean, may be
eaten, but all meats are clean; and Paul is persuaded of that by Jesus Christ.
Ergo, The Apostle answers, 1. by denying the major Proposition in two cases,
and sets down a distinction. All things are clean in themselves, but they
become unclean, in two cases. 1. If one weak in the faith believe* that the
meat, that he eats, is against the word of God, the me at to him is unclean.
2, If he eat before, one that believes it is forbidden in Gods Law, to eat
such meats, his eating is a stumbling block to the weak. But one might say,
It is a taken Scandal, and not given: for it is lawful to eat, thy brother
deemeth it unlawful out of ignorance of Christian liberty, so say Formalists
Ceremonies be indifferent; if any offend at the use of them, it is ascandall
taken, not given. O but Paul forbids to scandalize, or to eat.

Hence the 9. Proposit. The use of things indifferent, as Ceremonies, before
any Law ^e made of them* by confession of Formalists, is indifferent* and may
be done* and not done, but if they scandalize, Paul proves by eight arguments
they are unlawful* 1. If fights with Charity, that for meat, so l^tle a
thing, for the knot of a straw, a Ceremony, thou slay thy brother* for whom
Christ died, v. 15. Where these reasons be. 1. It is uncharitable walking. 2.
It is murder, slay not him. 3. It is contrary to Christ's love, who died for
thy brother. 4. It makes Religion and Christian liberty, to be evil spoken
of, v. 16. 5. From the nature of these things* which are indifferent, these in
which the Kingdom of God consists not, as Meats and Surplic^ crossing
kneeling, etc. when they scandalize, ought to be omitted, as being against
righteousness, and being sins of murder. 2. Against Peace, sins of
contention, 3. against joy of the Holy Ghost, making sad, and discouraging thy
brother in his Christian ^ace, and he that serves God in peace and
righteousness, and joy is acceptable v. 18, 6. The use of things indifferent
in case of scandal conduce not to peace and edification, v. 19. 7. It is a
destroying of the work of God* v. 20. illustrated by a repeated prolepsis, but
the meat is clean; ^ea, but (says Paul) it is evil, and so morally unclean to
him that eats with offense, v. 20. 8. Ab equo and ^ono, we are to do good,
but to eat and drink with the scandalizing of our brother, and to practice
Ceremonies is not Good*

Proposit. 10. The practicing of things indifferent, or Ceremonies for the very
^^^ ^ing of the ^aith, that we have Christian liberty to practice, or no^
practice in the case of scandal, is not lawful, v. 22. set down by a
pro^epsis, Keep the faith of thy Christian liberty (in case of scandal) to
thy self, and to God.

Proposit 11. In the use of things indifferent, we are to allow our selves,
that is to have the approbation of our Conscience, that what we do is
lawfully, v 22.

Proposit. 12. He that practices indifferent things, with a doubting
conscience, and not in faith, sins, and is condemned, v. 23.

1 Cor. 6* v 12 All things (indifferent) are lawful in themselves, but they
are not expedient. If we be brought under the power or band of them by law.
Ergo, in the means of worship, not only must we see what is lawful, but also
what is profitable and conducing to the end. He reasons upon a given, but not
granted hypothesis, that Fornication is indifferent, as the Gentiles taught, as
we do in the matter of Ceremonies.

1 Cor. 7. v. 6. But this I speak by permission* not of Commandment. Ergo in
things, in which God has granted us liberty, to do, or not to do,
permission has place, not obliedging necessity, or penal laws.

13 Proposit. There cannot be commanding Laws in things that are polltickly
good, or evil, according to the individual complexion* temperature, or gifts
of singular men, to marry, or not to marry, cannot be commanded, for where God
loses, no power on earth can bind* v. 33.

1 Cor. 8. v. 7. Paul condemns them in the use of their liberty Christian,
Howbeit there be not in every man this knowledge, then that Rulers may make
laws in things indifferent, without scandal, they must remove ignorance. 2.
If there be but one person weak ( there is not in every man that knowledge) in
knowledge, a Law obliedging all, in things indifferent cannot be made.

V. 8. There is a definition of a thing indifferent. It is a thing that
commends us not to God, which neither helps, nor hinders piety, nor
makes a man better, or worse before God. Then Ceremonies pretended to be for
order, decency, edification, to stir up the dull mind to spiritual duties,
cannot be things indifferent.

Hence observe 1. The materials of worship, as linen, clothes, habites,
gestures may be in their physical consideration indifferent, but as applied by
formulistes, they cannot be indifferent, for in their use, kneeling
appropriated to sacramental bread, linen appropriated to the body of a
Priest, while he officiateth, cannot be but religious or profane. 2. If God
command gestures he commands this gesture, hic and nunc. If in general,
^^ealing be forbidden, then for Achan, to steal this Babylonish garment, must
be forbidden. 3. It seems to have been afternoon with Henry Lesly (
Pretended Hen. Lesly, B^sho^ o^ Down authority of the Church, page 144.
) of after cups, when he says, if Papists and Protestants be two diverse
kinds of worshippers then their actions of worship must be indifferent, as be
their agents, for actions are distinguished by their objects and ends, Papists
in kneeling worship their God of bread, we in kneeling at the Sacrament worship
the true God. For when a Turk and a Christian do both worship Dagon, it is the
same Idolatry, though ^urcisme and Christianisme be different religions.
Though kneeling to an Image, the similitude of God, and that same kneeling to
Jehovah, represented in that similitude, Es* 40. v. 8. make one formal object,
the Image the material, Jehovah the formal object* yet is it idolatry. 4.
Our circumstances of time and place, cannot properly be called indifferent, for
they may be considered two ways. 1 Physically. 2 Religiously. Physically. The
Commandment injoyning a thing, injoyneth also time and place convenient, he
that says ( the shall not kill) in that same very Commandment said ( Cain,
thou shall not kill Abel in this place of the field, at this time,) so to
believe, and to believe in this time and place, falls both under one, and the
same Commandment; And it is true, the lawfulness of Worship may be marred by
bad Circumstantiating of the worship, If one shall pray, when the Pastor does
preach; But Circumstances must be convenient, and so commanded, and so not
indifferent, but Circumstances have no religious respect put on them by God,
and therefore in that state have no room in Gods worship,

V. 1^. If any man see thee, who have knowledge, sit at meat in the Idols
Temple shall not the conscience of him that is weak, ^e emboldened, to eat
these things that are offered to Idols. Hence a naked sight of that which is
ordinarily exponed to be a Communion with an idol, as kneeling religiously to
bread is, must be a scandal. 2. The supposed knowledge of one, who says, an
Idol is nothing, but directs his worship to God, when external gestures are
used in an idolatrous way, does not free the practice of such a worship, from
scandal.

V. 11. 12. 13. Scandalizing in eating things, otherwise poor and clean, is a
scandalizing of a weak brother, against the price of Christ's blood, etc. 1
Cor. 10.

V. 16. 17. 18. Communion in Rites and Ceremonies o^ a raise worship, is a
communion with the Idol, and Satan.

V. 22. Though you keep your heart to God, ye provoke the Lord to jealousy.

V. 23. Rulers are not to seek their own, in things indifferent.

V. 25. Things sacrificed to Idol^, yet in no religious state, are clean
meats, and may be eaten. Surplice on a Noblemans porter is no Mass habit, and
so not scandalous.

29. 30. In things indifferent, I must abstain from ^sing my liberty, where I
am in danger to be evil spoken of, and that our liberty be called
licentiousness.

Quest. II.
Whether or no the Ceremonies and things indifferent commanded by humane
authority be objects scandalous, and what rules are to be observed in eschewing
scandalls.

FOrmalists object, That Ceremonies be not no^ent agents in giving scandal,
but men do unjustly take scandal, whereas innocent Ceremonies give none.

But observe that a scandal is given two ways. 1 Physically. An object
scandalous two ways.
2. Morally. Physically, when the object has an influence merely physical in
raising Scandal, in this meaning, as there be no passion, but it has an
action; so there is no scandal taken, but it is some way given. The Pharisees
are scandalized at Christ's preaching. The preached Word had some influence on
their corruption to scandalize it, but physical, not moral: but sinful and
inordinate actions, scandalize morally by contributing, a moral influence
culpably to the scandalizing of others. Hence the question is, wherein stands
this moral and culpable influence.

The objects in General from whence comes scandal be Somethings may be
scandalous objects.
four. 1. Things good. 2. Things sinful and evil. 3. Things indifferent,
inordinatly, or unseasonably done. 4. Things that have appearance of evil.

A thing good of it self is not scandalous, but there be two Goodthing^. 1.
Some simply necessary* ^s to love God, not to steal, not to forswear, these
be never scandalous. 2. Some good duties positive of affirmative precepts, as
not necessary, hic and nunc, may be omitted to eschew scandal. School men
move a question. If it be lawful to omit works commanded of God, or of the
law of nature to eschew the scandal of our brethren? I answer, a natural
commandment to eschew the scandalizing of my brother, obliedgeth in some
Circumstances, but not simply, for it obliedgeth not when there occurreth a
Commandment natural of greater obligation, whether it be natural or
positive, if I cannot decline the transgression of the law of God, in the
declining of scandalizing my brother, Certainly the Commandment of not
scandalizing does not obliedge, for I am more obliedged to have a care of my
own salvation, then of my brothers, and so to prevent my own sins, the^^
the sinning of my brother: yet Coeteris paribus, if all other things be alike,
as Becauus p. 2. de Charit. c. 21. quaest. 5. nu. 5.
Becanus says. A natural command, such as is, (not to scandalize) that is,
(not to commit soulemurther) does oblige more, then a positive Commandment, as
to hear the Word hic and nunc. I am obliedged hic and nunc, to omit hearing of
the Word to keep my brother from killing himself, and to preserve my brothers
temporal life. because, the Lord will have mercy, and not sacrifice. Though I
be not obliedged universally to omit the hearing of the Word* and receiving of
the Sacraments, to eschew the scandal of my brother. 2. Sins publicly
committed, are of their own nature culpably scandalous.

3. In things indifferent, from whence arises a Scandal there be two things.
1. The use of the thing it self. 2. The use of it, with the non-necessitie of
existence in it. As the causey stones are not scandalous, if any fall on them,
nor the layer of the causey to be blamed therefore, because causay stones be
necessary, but if any lay an huge block in the way, which has no necessary
use there, he who does so is the cause of the fall, because he contributeth to
the fall, that which is the occasion, and so the cause of the fall, for every
occasion is a certain cause. 2. Because he contributeth such an occasion as
has no moral necessity of existence, so the brazen Serpent having lost its
virtue of curing and being adored as God, is formally a scandalous object, and
the Prince suffering that to remain, when it is not necessary, and withal
occasioneth the idolatry of many, does culpably scandalize, and so these who
for sole will commands such things as the worship of God may want, do also
scandalize. They object, Christ might have healed on another day, then the
Lords. Ergo, the non-morall necessity makes not the object formally
scandalous, nor does the contributer thereof culpably scandalize.

Answ. That Christ should cure on the Sabbath, was morally necessary. 1. If it
were but from his own will, but men's will cannot make things necessary. 2. It
was necessary to show, that the Son of man was Lord of the Sabbath. 3. That
the Sabbath was made for man. and not man for the Sabbath. 4. To show, that
works of mercy are to be preserred to works of Ceremonies, and that God
loves mercy, rather then Sacrifice,

When the duty is only possible, and the good less necessary, then the good
of non-scandalizing, then we are not, for hope of a possible duty, and less
necessary, to do that from whence a Scandal does arise. So it was not
lawful for Paul to take stipend, which should have hindered the promoving of
the Gospel, though he might have employed that stipend upon charitable uses,
because that Charity was a duty only possible, and incomparably less
necessary, then the promoting of the Gospel. So 1 Cor. 6. 7. Why suffer ye
not rather loss? yet by that suffering loss, they were less able for works
of Charity, and to provide for their Family and Children, but the gain was
temporal, and not to be compared with a good fame upon Christian religion,
which was slandered by heathen, when they went to law, Christian against
Christian, before an Heathen Judge.

The fourth scandalous object, is that which has appearance of evil. Not
every thing is such, for good has the appearance of evil. Paybodie of
kneeling, par. 3 page 410.
Paybodie to elude this, shows a number of things which have appearance of
evil, but ^are good, and he names among them, Hushaies abiding with Absolon
in his conspiracy, which was plain dissimulation, but that properly has
appearance of evil. 1. Quod plaerumque fit malo fine, as the Schoolmen define
it, that which ordinarily is done for an evil end, as to ly in bed with
another man's wife, to sit at the Idols table, to bow to an Image. 2. That which
being good in it self, yet because of the circumstances is exponed vainglory,
as to pray in the streets, its ordinarily exponed to be for this end, to be
seen Silvius in 22. g. 43. 4. Facere coram aliis id quod habet speciem mali,
tune solum est peccatum scandali, quando non subest causa legittima presentibus
manefestata. - Satis notum erat quod Namaam non se flecteret pro cultu idoli,
sed pro obsequio regis.
of men. These who expone that place, 1 Thessalonians. 5. Abstain from all appearance
of evil, to be, abstain from that which seems evil to the conscience, and
judgment of the doer, or only of doctrine reach not the Apostles mind: for
to sit at the Idols table, to bow to an Image, and keep the heart to God, are
out of doubt appearances of evil forbidden in the text, yet are they not
doctrines seeming evil always, to the judgment of the practisers. They
object, to look up to the beavens and Sun may have appearance of praying to
the Sun and heavens, for in the external fact, no more could be done by a
person adoring the Sun. Ergo, such appearances cannot be scandalous Objects.
Answer, lifting up of the eyes in prayer, are natural adumbrations and
expressions of the elevation of the heart, required in prayer, Psalm. 25. v. 1.
and so commonly exponed by all Nations, and therefore cannot be appearances of
evil. Hence these rules.

I. Suppose all be strong, in whose presence I practice, a thing indifferent,
yet if it have no necessity, no aptitude to edify, and Rules touching scandal.
have only all its goodness from the will of commanders, in practicing, I
scandalize, 1. Because the strong are apt to sin, and so apt to be
scandalized, and the action is idle, and not reasonable, having no other reason
but the mere will of Rulers. 2. If I probably know my practice, shall come to
the knowledge of these, who shall be scandalized, I scandalize them in such an
action.

II. Rule. Though the practice of things indifferent, having some necessity,
be lawful, as 1 Cor. 10. 27. Eat what is set before you* asking no question
for conscience sake* Yet the ^aith and conscience of things indifferent, is
never indifferent, we are never to judge a thing indifferent, necessary, nor a
thing necessary, indifferent, and practice in that judgment, so erroneous is
finfull, and not of faith, Romans 14 ^. 22.

III Rule. An universal omission of good, of obeying affirinative precepts,
for the eschewing of scandal, cannot be lawful for it is 1. necessary for my
salvation to obey affinnative precepts, though not in all differences of time.
In this meaning August. Epist* 199 Non est cessandum ab operibus bonis, pro
quocunque scandalo.
Augustine said, We are not to abstain from good works, (he means a total
abstainence) for any scandal. And Tertullian Tertul. Res bona neminem
offendit, nisi malam mentem.
good offends non, save a wicked mind, But at sometime an obedience to an
affirmative precept, hic and nunc may be omitted, when we see that from the
doing thereof, the ignorant and weak will commit great sins. So Aquinas* in
22. q. 43. and
Aquinas, Bannes tom. 3 m 22. q 43 art 8 cap 4 Propter scandalum quod vel ex
imbecill^tate, vel ex ignorumi ^ nascitur, decl^^^dae omnes quan^^mcunque
rectae action atque utles, and que ad animae salutem non su^t necessariae,
praeter mittendae and occultandae, out s^l^em in aliud tempus differendae.
Bannes. Sanch^z in decal. l. 4 disp 32. Dub 6 n 66* con 3. Quando ex aliquo
opere quantumvis bono, crederetur magna hominum multitudo, ex infirmitate aut
ignorantia inducend^ in gravia peccata, illud omittendum etiam cum jact^ra
vitae and bonorum spiritualium ad s^^tem non necessariorum.
Sanches for affirmative precepts of the law of nature (says Bannes to 3. 22 q
43 art. 8 conclu. 2. Praecepta affirmativa juris naturalis aliquando propter
scandalum sunt dimittenda -- quia praecepta affirmativa obligant, quando, and
quomodo opo^tct.
Bannes) must sometime be omitted, for the eschewing of scandal, for they do
not obliedge, but when, and after such a manner, as is convenient.

V. Rule. To do any good action, or lawful, or indifferent, when I probably
foresee a scandal will follow, is an active scandal, for I prefer my own
will, to my brothers salvation (says Antoninus 2 p. to. 1 cap 9* sect. ult.
tit 3. cap 4 Verereus est pecca^i proximi qui absque ulla just^ causa non
impedit scandalum, quod ex suo opere est f^turum, quia videtur contemnere vitam
spiritualem fratris
Antoninus, and Navarr. in sum. cap 4. ^ 13.
Navarret,) and therefore says (i) Antoninus; A virgin going abroad, without
just necessity, where her beauty shall be a snar^ to young men, or to go out
upon a necessary cause with a whorish attire, is an active scandal, her feet*
abides not in her house, says Proverb 7.
Solomon. And Navar^. in sum. cap 4. n. 13* Mortaliter peccat, qui ita parvi
aestimat salutemproximi, ut absque justa necessitate, and utilitate, ex ^ola
sua voluntate aliquid facit, unde fra^er est scandalizandus.
Navarr, says, It is to sin mortally and Silvester in summa in verbo,
obedientia, n 5. Si Papae mandatum sapiat etiam peccatum veniale Item si ex
obedientia praesum^retur sta^us Ecclesiae perturbandus, vel aliud malum aut
scandalum futurum, etiamsi praeciperetur sub soe^a Excommunicationis -- non est
ei obediendum.
Silvester says, If the Popes commandment do but smell of venial sin, and
if by giving audience thereunto, it be presumed that the state of the Church
shall be troubled, or a scandal shall arise, though the commandment go out
under the pain of Excommunication, it is not to be obeyed. Vasquez tom. 4. in
3. ^ 43. art. 7 Dub 2.
Vasques, and Suarez de tripl. v r. Theolo. disp 10. De Scandalo. sect. 4 Res
indifferentes vender^, donare, aut alicui proponere, quando prascitur, alterum
ijs male us^rum, est scand* lum committere.
Suarez say, to sell, gift, or dispose of any things indifferent, when we
foresee they shall abuse them, is to commit the sin of active scandalizing.
Yea, the form of an Idol, though he never adore it, does highly scandalize,
and Antoninus 2 p. to* 7. cap. 4. ^ 4.
Antoninus Silvester verbo scandalum q 2.
Silvester, Corduba sum. q. 5. fol. 30.
Corduba, Metina 12* cap. 74 ^^* 6. ad* 3. fol. 677.
Metina, Sanch z in Decal to 1. lib 1. cap 6. nu. 16.
the Jesuit Zanches teach, That to contribute to that which we see, shall
induce any to sin, is to be guilty of scandalizing. And the reasons be these;
1. We are not to prefer our will to the salvation of our brother. 2. Things
less necessary, then our brothers salvation, in that case become not
necessary, and so fruitless and idle. 3. Charity inferferreth, that we
hinder so far, as we can, the ruin of our brothers soul, Scandaell is
spiritual homicide. 4. To contribute any moral help, and influence to our
brothers fall, and soul-ruine, is to be accessarie to his sin* Hence
Ceremonies and things not necessary to salvation, may be omitted altogether in
their specialities, when the practicing of them does scandalize, and so though
kneeling in Gods worship cannot well be universally omitted, yet kneeling
appropriate to such an act of worship may be omitted, and ought to be omitted,
if it scandalize, and Ceremonies which scandalize universally, seeing they are
not in their very kind necessary to salvation, are to be abolished.

Yet I may add one caution here. To contribute help for the doing of that,
which of it self is necessary, which I know, an other in respect of humane
frailty, will abuse to sin is no active scandal. So to lay hands on a
qualified Pastor is not sin, though I foresee through humane frailty, he
will abuse his power in some things to sin. So, for an Artificer to make
swords, though he know some shall abuse them to murdering the innocent, is no
scandalous work. I take not on me to prescribe rules for eschewing scandal in
all occurrences of providence. The godly learned can see more then I can do in
this matter, where love should be wary to lay a straw in the way of any weak
traveller.

Quest. III.
Whether or no we may deny obedience to the laws of our Superiors, for fear
of Scandal causleslie taken.

THis is not my question, but a question of the Doctors of Aberdeen, yet it
conduces for the times, and because one of the learnedest of these Doctors did
agitate the question of scandal with me in private, before the writing of that
book, I desire liberty to vindicate my self, by discussing two chapters of
this purpose.

And first the question seems to me many ways vain. 1. They ask about
denial of obedience, which is not proved, but presumed to be obedience. 2.
They presume that the Masters, the Lord Prelates of Pearth faction are our
Superiors, by no law of God, or our Church was ever any superiority conferred
upon them. 3. They say for scandal causlesly taken: if they mean that there
be no just reason indeed why any should take scandal, they say nothing against
us, for we think to take scandal, is to sin, if they know any just reason
or cause of sin, except Satan and men's free will, we shall be taught of them.
If they mean scandalously taken, that is, not culpably given by the practisers
of Ceremonies, this is a Chimera, and to us no question, for we are not to
deny obedience to lawful laws, for eschewing Scandal, when obeyers do give
no cause culpably of Scandal, they would have formed the question to our
reverend and learned Brethren if they had dealt plainly. Whether or no, we may
desist from practicing Coremonies, which, setting aside the law of Superiors,
are indifferent, when from the practicing of them arises the ruin of many
souls, for whom Christ died. In things necessary commanded and forbidden of
God, we cannot deny obedience, but the matter of the laws is silenced in the
question to deceive the reader.

Duplyers. Doctors of Aberdeen. If the scandal arising from Pearth Articles
come, ex condition operis, from the irregularitie of the fact, you say, we
should forbear them forever, yet this you gainsay in the next Chap. nu. 44.
page 67. We say that the lawful command of our Superiors may make that
scandal of our weak brethren, not to beimputed to us, as a matter of our
guiltiness, which otherwise would be imputed to us as a matter of our
guiltiness. Now (I say) no scandal but that which is scandal ex condition
operis, from the enormitie o^ the p^actice can be imputed to us as guiltiness
or sin, for passive scandal is unjustly impu^ed to us as sin.

IF the Scandal arising from the Articles of Pearth come, ex condition
operis, from the very enormitie in these Articles, then are we to forbear
these ^rticles ever, and not only while they be tried in a lawful* Assembly
for such are either sin, or have a manifest show of sin. But if the
scandal arise not from the Articles themselves, but from malice or weakness,
we deny that we are totally to abstain from obedience to lawful Superiors,
for eschewing Scandal causlesly taken, and we marvel from whence ye have
learned this strange and harsh doctrine.

Answ. 1. Your enumeration is weak, for we know no Scandal justly taken, but
proceeding from both these, weakness or wickedness of nature, is the nearest
cause of all Scandal taken, because it is the cause of all sin, and to be
scandalized is sin. Also it is here taken from the enormitie of the deed, in
that practicing of things indifferent, if a scandal taken either weakly or
maliciously thence arise, there is enormitie in the deed, yet total abstinence
is not hence concluded, because, cessante ratione scandali, when the ground of
the Scandal is removed, there is no enormitie in the fact. 2. You define to
us, or rather divine, that then there is an irregularitie in the fact that
justly scandaliz^th, when either the fact is a sin, or then has a manifest
show of sin. And we wonder where you learned this strange Divinity, for 1
Cor. 10. 27. To eat meat at a Feast that you are invited unto* is neither
sin, because v. 23. 25. it is lawful: The earth is the Lords, nor is it such
as has a manifest show of sin, as all having sense knows. One of your
prime Doctors defined to me, these only have manifest appearance of sin,
Quae pl^rumque fiunt malo fine, which for the most part are done for an evil
and, such as is to lie in bed with another man's wife, to kneel before an
Idol. The form^r, in the exposition of all is done for adultery, the latter
for Idolatry. I am sure to eat meats at an Infidels feast, is not of that
nature which is done ordinarily for an evil end, it is ordinarily done to
refresh nature, and to sol^^e it, which has no manifest show of sin, and yet
if there be a weak one beside, who says, that meat is offered to Idols, in
that case to eat, is to scandalize 32. and is against the glory of God, v. 31.
3. You ask from whom we learned this strange doctrine to deny obedience to the
laws of Superiors for scandal causlesly taken; And we answer, we learned it
from the Apostle Paul, who says 1 Cor. 8. 13. If meat offend my weak brother,
I will eat no flesh (I will abstain totally and absolutely) while the world
stands. This abstinence for the date of the worlds standing, God be thanked,
is longer then the time to a lawful General Assembly was at that time: yet
the Apostle proves, Romans 14. That to eat, or not to eat, was at that time as
indifferent, as to practice, or not practice Ceremonies, also who ever offended
at Paul's eating of fleshes, were offended out of weakness, v. 7. and it was in
that sense, scandal causlesly taken.

Duplyers page 59. n. 34.
The Author of the popish English Ceremonies, says that both Cajetan Duplyers
Doct. Aberdeen.
and Bannes affirm, that we should abstain a spiritualibus non necessariis,
from spiritual duties not necessary to salvation, when Scandal arises from
the doing of them, but none of the Schoolmen ever taught to abstain totally,
and altogether from any spiritual duty, for eschewing the scandal of either
weak, or wicked.

Answer. What the author of the English Popish Ceremonies says in that
subject, all your learning shall never be able to Answer, for our brethren,
required but abstinece from these Ceremonies, till they be tried in a lawful
General Assembly, for they never were yet tried in a lawful Assembly, till
the late Assembly at Glasgow, anno 1638. 2. That Author argues a Majore, and
we desire an Answer, if we may abstain from spiritual duties commanded by the
most high Superior the Lord our God. hic and nunc in case of Scandal. Ergo,
far more are we to abstain, from practicing of dead Ceremonies void of all
spirit of life, in the case of scandal, yea and universally, and totally we
are to abstain, because the Superiors have no power to make laws in materia
scandalosa, when that which they command is scandalous; and in the very matter
soule-murther.

Duplyers.
Thomas and his followers say, Bona spiritualia non necessaria Nu. 35.
sunt dimittenda propter scandalum, in ijs quae sunt sub consili^, non vero sub
praecepto* We may omit spiritual duties for eschewing scandal which fall
under counsel, but not under commandment.

Answer. We conceive you not to be Papists, to hold this distinction, then
far more things indifferent for a time, in case of scandal may be forborne,
when Counsels the performance whereof merit a greater degree of glory in
heaven* may be suspended. 2. It is false, for Aquinas 22. q. 43.
Aquinas says, Actiones quantumcunque rectae atque utiles omittendae. So
Bannes 16. a^. 8. ca. 4.
D. Bannes.

Duplyers.
The most accurat Casuists and Interpreters of Thomas, deny, that we can deny
obedience to civil and Ecclesiastical laws* for ^schewing scandal of the
weak. So Navarrus in man^ali cap 19. sect. 44. Vasquez to.5. Tract* de

^lorent.

Answer 1. Aquinas 16.
Aquinas says, Excommunication may be omitted in the case of scandal. Now the
Churches precept of Excommunication is no counsel, but a precept. And it is
lawful says Thomas to rebuke our brother, and an act of Mercy and Charity
commanded (says Aquinas 22. q. 33. art. 1.
he) in the law of nature, and so not a Counsel. Yet says Thomas, in case of
scandal it may be omitted. Navar. in sum. cap. 4. n^ 13.

Dupliers.
The Schoolmen well us not to forbear obedience, with a quite disclaiming of
the authority of the Law, as you do. Ans, Lawful authority of Prelates
laws we know none. 2. Schoolmen say more, that the obligation of laws do
cease in case of scandal.

Duplyers.
This kind of forbearance for eschewing of scandal we improve. 1. Arg. The
author of English Popish Ceremonies, part. 1. cap. 4. sect. 4. Not to obey the
laws of the Church in things whereof we are certainly persuaded they are not
unlawful and inexpedient, is a contempt and a scandal. But we are persuaded
the things here, to wit, Articles of Pearth be neither unlawful nor
inexpedient. Ergo* The major is yours, the Assump. we prove by the light of our
conscience.

Answer. The author says so indeed, but withal he says, that Church laws
bind not the conscience, because they are Church laws, Sed propter rationem
legum, for the reason of the laws; and such you cannot show to be in your
Ceremonies. 2. The Assumption is badly proved, for your consciences are not
transparent glass; except that light come out in arguments founded upon the
law and testimony, and where this is not, there is no light, Es. 8. 20. an
erring conscience proves nothing, so you beg the question.

Duplyers 2. arg. n. 37.
That which may be removed by information and instruction, cannot be awarrand
to us of a total abstinence, from the obedience of the laws, or which is all
one, of an avowed disclaiming of the authority of them. But the scandal of
the weak taken by Pearth Articles, may be removed by information, or
instruction. Ergo.

I must crave here leave for a pause, and ask the question. 1. If information
and light given to beware of the scandal of Ceremonies and things indifferent,
can make them the lawful object of Church Canons, D. Forbes and other say so.
But 1. This D. Forbes. Iren.
is that which Papists say to our Divines, who object that Images are pits and
snares to Idolatry. This danger (says Ioannes de Lugo de mist. ^^arn. ^ i p
36 sect 1. n 3. Hoc periculum facile praecavetur doctrina and cura Proelatorum,
qui d^cent frequ^n^er imagines non habere in se, nec prop^^r se aliquam
dignitatem, nisi quam accipiant ab exemplari.
Johannes de Lugo) the Popes Professor at Rome, is easily prevented by the
instruction and care of Prelates, who are to teach, that Images have no
dignity of themselves, but only from the samplar. And so Bellarm. 1 2. de
rel. sanct. c 4. ad 2 Nec desunt in Eccles^^ qui doceant literis, and
s^rmonibus, quis cultus reliquiss (formulist^ elementis sacramentalibus) de.
beatur.
Bellarm. the Jesuit, Vasquez in 3 part. 10. 1. disp 105. 5. n. 3 Quare nec
aliquid periculi in ipsarum (imaginum) adora^ione, si populus tudis, ju^ta
sinccram fidem and religionean, mediocriter instituatur.
Vasquez. Estius, lib. 3 did. 36. sect 7. Ecclesia diligenter and doctrina,
and opere distinguit inter honorem Deo proprium, and eum qui Divinis ac Dei
amicis hominibus tribuitur.
Estius. Council Moguntinum, cap. 41. Pastores nostri populum accurate moneant,
imagines non ad id proponi, ut eas adoremus - Sed ut per imagines recordemur.
The Council of Magountine helps the matter. Let our Pastors (say they)
carefully teach the people, that Images are not set up, that we should adore
them, but that they should be helps for our memory. 2. Paul gave strong
reasons for lawfulness of days, and meats, that weak Jews should not be
scandalized at the eating thereof. yet he would neither pass them in a Church
Canon, nor practice them himself, while the world stands, 1 Cor. 8. 13. yea,
he proves Romans 14. by eight strong Arguments, that it was not lawful to
practice them. Ergo, he presuproseth that information of Pastors should not
take away the scandal of the weak, as Romans 14. 14. There is nothing unclean
of it self. Ergo, It is lawful to eat all meats, 1 Cor. 10. 26. The earth is
the Lords. Ergo, eat what is set before you, v. 23. all things are lawful, and
yet he says, eat not, give no offense, if meat offend my brother, I will not
eat to the worlds end. 1 Cor. 8. 13. 3. This vain argument presupposes that
the want of literal information, is the adequat cause of falling in scandal,
a vain reason. Peter actively and culpably scandalized Christ in his carnal
counsel, Master, pity thy self, Mat. 16 21. 22. 23. yet Christ was
sufficiently enlightened, that he could not be scandalized. But certain it is,
that the will and depraved inclination is the cause why we fall in scandal,
even when we know that others who publicly sins, does sin, and that we
should not be scandalized. Now no reason in Pastors preaching, or in
Church-Canon, can take away the inclination of the heart to evil, and
therefore no information of Pastors can remove the scandal of the weak; For
then David in committing adultery, Noah in drunkenness, Lot in his incestuous
folly with his own daughters, Peter in denying his Savior, should not have
caused others within, or without the Church to stumble, nor have culpably
scandalized them; So David. Noah, Lot, and Peter, had preached to all that
heard of their fall, that adultery, drunkenness, incest, and denial of
Christ, were grievous sins to be avoided, and that it was sin for any to be
scandalized thereat, for such information should have given sufficient literal
information to beware of the like sins. Yea, a father might enclose in a
chamber, his son and a beautiful virgin, and if he should sufficiently
inform his son of the guiltiness, and punishment of harlotrie, he should not
lay a stumbling block before his son. Yet we all know, a stumbling block may
be laid before the inclination no less, then before the blind mind, yea
suppose, to warn a Traveller of a pit, in his way, might be sufficient, to
make the digger of the pit free of laying a stumbling block in the way (as it
is not) seeing to make a pit is not indifferent, yet it shall not free the
Commanders of Ceremonies and the acts of Pearth Assembly of active scandal,
because men naturally loving life and health, hate to fall into pitts, which
may endanger their life, and so have no inward moral inclination to fall into
a pit; but men though informed of spiritual falls, and warned to beware of
them, yet love and incline to Idolatry, and therefore to warn them to beware,
and yet set the powder near the fire, is but to scorn the craft, and to mock
men. Yea, in that they desire and require, that the people beware of the
Ceremonies, and require that Pastors inform them of the danger; they grant
that Ceremonies are powder amongst the pitchers, and yet they be innocent, and
indifferent creatures, as if they would call them indifferent pitts,
indifferent whoores to allure, beware of them; indifferent pest-cloathes, see
that your inclination touch them not. Yea, then Ezechiah had given no scandal,
if he had commanded the brazen Serpent still to stand, and had commanded the
Priests to preach that the Serpent was not God, and therefore warned the people
of their Idolatry in burning Incence to it, only let it stand as a memorial
of Gods power in curing the people, who were stinged with Serpents in the
Wilderness. So if the Israelites should give their sons and daughters to
marry strange women of the Canaanites, if they should ordain the Priests to
teach carefully their married children, to beware, that they were not drawn
away, by these idolatrous marriages, to serve the Gods of the Canaanites, they
should not lay a stumbling block before their sons and daughters. Yea, these
who excel in light, may be weak in grace, and in hazard to be ensnared, by
the idolatry and superstition of Ceremonies.

4. The law of nature provideth all possible and lawful means for the
removal of every thing, that may rnine his soul, for whom Christ died, but
not only information of the danger of Ceremonies, but also the removal of the
pitts themselves, to wit, the Ceremonies are possible and lawful means.

5. 1. This were an idle Sabbath work to expound such theams as these
Sacramental bowing is an humble adoring of God, not of bread, (and as it
pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save believers, so it pleased
Prelates, by the foolishnes of holy days and Saints days, to teach the people
articles of faith, and by the Surplice to teach pastoral innocence, and by
confirmation to bless children*) 2 Calvin. Iusti* l. 4. c 8. sect. 8.
Calvin, and Luthercom in Gal 1. neque alia doctrina in Ecclesia tradi, aut

Luther teach, that no word should be heard in the Church, nisi purum Dei
verbum, but the pure word of God. Surplice humane and Saints days, crossing,
kneeling, cannot be a text that Ministers can preach on, and expound, for they
are commanded to speak Gods word, Ezech. 7. To read Gods law, and give the
meaning and sense thereof, Nehem. 8. 8. and to expone the Scriptures, Luke 24.
27. not to teach the meaning of wretched Ceremonies, for in that they should
not be the Pastors of Christ, but speak with the mouth of Antichrist, and
Exodus 12. 26. 27. If the children ask the fathers, what mean ye by this
Passover, they were to answer, It is the Sacrifice of the Lords Passover. So
if they ask what means your kneeling to Bread, your Saints days, your
Surplice and Crossing, you must answer, they are the Ceremonies of the Lords
Supper, and Baptism; What uncouth bleating were this? 6. Shall people (says
D. Ammes D. Ammes fresh fuit.
be fed with this East wind, the virtue of Surplice, when there be so little
time, to learn the maine things of the Gospel? also some preach none, some
study never Ceremonies, some blush to speak of such toys. Yea* and alas
often says, Bannas, tom. 3. m 22. q. 43. art 8. Nota posse contingere ut
pusilli non sirt capaces rat^onis redditae, and tunc quamvis sit reddita illis
ratio tamen ab hujusmodi spiritualibus cess^^dum, quia tunc non ex malicia, sed

Bannes the weak are not capable of distinctions, it is hard to draw the wits
of rude people along the untwisted thread of distinctions, that the elements
are objectum adorationis a quo significative and objectum adorationis relativae
materiale, non adorationis formale. I conceive the Doctors of Aberdeen have
ado with their wits to understand them, they must be taught of D. Mortounes
essential and accidental worship; of Bellarmines additions perfecting, and
additions corrupting the word of God. And whereas D. Forbes says; It is a
shame for Ministers, and teachers of others to pretend weakness, though the
flock might be ignorant. Answer. Weakness, is weakness of faith, Romans 14. 1.
and weakness of grace, not weakness in literal light. And I think Ministers
may pretend this upon too good grounds, and weakness of faith is often a great
inclination to superstition. 2. Though the Ministers refusing the Ceremonies,
should understand them as well as these who writ books for their defense, yet
it will not follow that they should practice them, for their forbearance is for
fear of scandalizing the weak. Paul had perfect knowledge of his Christian
liberty, as any man, yet he would not eat meats to the worlds end, which
should offend his brother. The stronger should not scandalize the weak, because
they are stronger.

Thirdly, if for Scandalls taken, especially by the malicious, we may disclaim
the authority of a Law, then we may ever disclaim the authority of all laws
of Church and State, for there is nothing commanded by laws, but some, either
through weakness, or through malice, may take offense at it.

Answer. 1. For scandalls taken, and also given, by either weak, or wilful,
when the matter is indifferent, and has evident conformity with Jewish and
Popish rites, and is not necessary, we may disclaim the authority of all such
laws, true. Ergo, we may for scandal maliciously taken, deny the authority of
all laws, it follows not. Ex affirmatione sp^ciei male colligitur negatio
generis. It is not for taken scandal, but for given scandal, that we
disclaim the authority of these laws. 2. The Doctors will have us believe,
upon the sole light of their conscience, n. 36. that they think the Ceremonies
lawful and expedient. But for us, they will not credit us in that, but out of
malice we are soandalized, and not out of weakness.

Duplyers n. 39. 4. arg.
Fourthly, We ought not for eschewing scandal causlesly taken, to injure or
offend any man, by denying to him, that which is due to him, and therefore we
ought not, for eschewing scandal causlesly taken* to offend and injure our
Superiors. The Antecedent is proved* for if a man be excomm^nicated, shall his
wife, children, and servants fly his company, and so deny these duties which
they owe to him, for fear that others be scandalized? and if we may not for
scandal causlesly taken abstain from these duties, that we owe to private
persons far less may we abstain from obedience, which we owe to Superiors,
etc.

Answer. Against the Law of disputing, you lay down a ground, which is a
principal part of the question that is practicing these Ceremonies be
obedience due to Superiors, and none practicing for a time an injuring of
Superiors in their due, though Gods affirmative precepts be omitted for a
time, as the not hearing the Word, the not receiving the Sacraments, in case of
Scandal, Gods due is not taken from him. If you will be more zealous for the
honor of Prelates and men, then for the honor of God. Answer the Argument
your self: I am not to reprove a scorner because of the scandal, he shall but
trample, as a sow, upon any word of reproof, yet the scandal were causle^ly
taken if we should do so, The good word of God should furnish no just cause to
him, yet am I not taking from God his due, and your bare word, that this is
disobedience to Superiors, not to practice Pearth Ceremonies is not enough to
us. 2. Your probation is weak, That children and wife keep company with the
Excommunicate father, is a commandment of the law of nature, and Gods
necessary law, and to deny this to an husband and father is such a sin, as
the eschewing of a scandal can never legitimate, but I hope kneeling to Bread,
and Crossing, and Surplice (commanded in our Canons and Service Book) are at
the best commanded by a positive law, and not commanded in the law of nature,
and so very unlike to natural duties that wife and children owe to father and
husband. 3. I retort this Argument. We may not wrong men in that which is their
due. Ergo, We may not wrong God in his due, but it is his due; ( Murder not
him for whom Christ died practice not Ceremonies before the weak who shall be
scandalized thereat.)

Duplyers 5. arg. n. 40.
What if the thing be commanded by the Civil Magistrate under pain of death,
and by Ecclesiastical authority under pain of Excommunication, shall we for
fear of scandal causlesly taken, which may be removed by information, or for
the scandal of the malicious, abstain from a thing lawful and expedient
enjoined by authority, and incur these grievous punishments of death*
temporal and spiritual? We believe your selves, who speak most of scandal,
would be loath to take such a yoke upon you.

Answer. The first part of this Argument is Logic from a sore* skin* That
which we are bidden do under pain of death, that we must do, the just logic
of the King of Babylon, to prove it is lawful to worship the Kings golden
Image, Dan. 3. 15. I have scarce heard Papists for shame press to conclude the
equity and lawfulness of a Law, from the penalty of a law, Suffering (as your
Jesuits and Arminians teach you) falls not under Free Will, and is not
culpably evil, nor is Excommunication except you be Papists, death of the
soul, when the cause of Excommunication is not just, and deserves no censure,
but it may be some of you think (Mr. Sibbald I know does it) that Navarrus, and
their Gregory said true, that unjust Excommunication is valid, and to be
feared: but if this argument (as I see not head nor feet in it) be founded upon
the lawfulness and expediencie of Ceremonies commanded, then not to practice
them at all. So first they be lawful. 2 Expedient* 3 Commanded by lawful
authority, is sin, and all sin is a death of the soul, and then you may
put your Argument from grievous punishments of body and soul in your pocket,
for it is of no use here* for whether punishment Civil or Ecclesiastic follow
upon disobedience to Superiors, it is sin. 3. That none of us would die or
be Excommunicated for eschewing Scandal, is no good argument, though many have
suffered as hard as death, banishment, and proscription of all, and
Excommunication also. But the truth is, you might have said; Shall we incur
for scandal the loss of our st^pends, and (one fair before the wind,
qualification) for a Bishopric?

Duplyers 6. arg. page 64. n. 41.
Sixthly, The denying of obedien^e to the lawful commandments of our
Superiors is forbidden in the ^i^^ commandment, and consequently it is sin*
shall we then for a scandal causlesly taken, deny obedience to our Superiors,
and so incur the guiltiness of sin? Ye commonly answer to this, that the
negative part of the fifth Commandment, w^^ch forbids the resisting of the
power, Romans 13* 2. is to be understood with the exception of the case of any
scandal taken by others. For ^^ we say (say ^^) that any may, or will take
offense, at the ^^ing of that which is commanded by our Superiors, we are not
holden to oby them 42. But first, we a^ke, what ^arr and ye have ^o say, that
the negative part of the fifth Commandment ^^ to be understood w^^^ the
exception of the case of Scandal* more then other negative precepts in the
second Table?

Answer ^. To fill the field, an Argument already answered, is brought again to
make the figure of fi^ up* The refusal of the Ceremonies till they be tried in
lawful Assembly, is not forbidden in the fifth Commandment, prove that* and
take it with you. 2. You bring an Answer as commonly given ^^ us, that is
neither ours, commonly, nor rarely* but it is good, build a straw^astle, and
you may soon cost a fire-ball at it, and blow it up* We never taught that the
negative part of the fif^ Commandment is to be understood with the exception
of the case of any scandal taken by others. For this includes all scandalls,
both passive and active. Who of ours ever dreamed such a thing, if Superiors
command, what God commands before them, do we teach that, because others
take scandal at that Command, therefore we are not holden to obey? that is
scandal taken, not given. We teach no such thing* Rulers command to honor
father and mother, if any take offense at this commandment and obedience to
either the affirmative or negative part of it, we are not to esteem that
scandal the weight of a feather, the Commandment obliedgeth. But this we
teach, if when the matter of the Commandment of Rulers is indifferent, as you
plead Ceremonies to be, if from obeying of these any weak or wicked be
scandalized, then the Rulers do command spiritual murder, and then their
commandment is no commandment, no^ is it the fifth Commandment. It is just
like this, You shall not refuse obedience to your Rulers, commanding you to
rub your beards when you come to the Church, or to draw a cross line with
your thumb in the air above a baptized infants forehead, though many souls,
by obedience to these Commandments* be induced to love Popery; many be made
sad thinking zealous Rulers, love popish toys better then the simplicity of
the Gospel. Now such is the Commandments of Pearth-articles, and these suffer
no exceptions, for we judge them no Commandments at all, and if any such be
enjoined upon pretense of any other of the nine Commandments, we hold them to
be impious commandments, and no obedience to be given to them at all. So if
according to the sixth Commandment, and the seven and eight, Rulers command to
run Carts amongst a multitude of young Children, whence killing of some might
fall out; If they should command a young man, and a fair virgin to chamber
together, and command Paul in the case he was at Corinth to take stipend,
though it should hinder the progress of the Gospel, as 1 Cor. 9. 23. all
these were to command culpable scandalls, and were unlawful, as the Canons of
Pearth faction. 3. You say, the negative part of the fifth Commandment
forbidding the resisting of the power, Romans 13. 2. by us, is to be understood,
with exception of the case of scandal taken, whereby you insinuate, that not
to obey the acts of Pearth Assembly, is a resisting of the power of Rulers,
Romans 13. 2. It is ignorantly spoken, to resist every law of the Rulers, is not
to resist his power, when the laws are such as commands scandal: yea, by
your own doctrine it is lawful to fly when a Ruler unjusty, commands and
persueth his subjects* page 3. n. 19. And to ^^ie I am sure, is to refuse
subjection to the Laws of the Ruler, from whose tribunal we ^li^, ye^, and to
fly so, is to resist his laws, but I hope it is not to resist the power, for
to resist the power, brings damnation, and guiltinesss before God, Romans 13.
2. But to fly from his legal Citations, is to resist his laws, but does not,
I hope, bring damnation before God, and sin upon the conscience, as you grant.

Men are ready to stumble, and to be scandalized at our refusing obedience to
the lawful Commandments of our Superiors: for they will take occasion by our
carriage, to do that, unto which by nature they be most inclined, to wit, to
vilipend Laws and Authority.

Answer. If any stumble at our non-obedience to Pearth Articles, and thence be
induced to vilipend Laws and Authority, it is a scandal merely taken, no
ways given, as is clear, because they stumble at our obedience to God, in
that we refuse to kill one for whom Christ died. 2. It is no ways true, that
men are naturally inclined to vilipend Laws in a matter indifferent, (as you
hold Ceremonies to be) from whence arises Scandal, yea, we are by nature much
bent to extol and love-lawes commanding soul-murther, and all laws inductive
to Popery, which is but a mass of carnal propositions of heterodox
Divinity, every way suitable to our flesh. The third exception is answered
already, the fourth is to be discussed in the following Chapter.

Quest. IIII.
Whether the Precept of obedience to Superiors, or the precept of eschewing
scandal be more obligatorie?

Dupliers page 65. n. 43.
LAst of all, when a man is perempt^rily urged by his Superiors, to obey their
lawful Commandments, and in the mean time fears* that if he do the thing
commanded by them* some, through weakness, shall be scandalized* by his
carriage; in this case he is not only in difficulty and strait, betwixt the
Commandment of men, and the Commandment of God, who forbids us to do that
whereby our weak brother may be offended. But also he seems to be in a
strait betwixt two Commandments of God, to wit, the precept that forbids us
to do that, whereby our weak brother may be scandalized and the other, which
forbids, the resisting of Authority.

Answer. 1. The question of purpose is perversely set do ^ne, for they should
say, whether the precept of obedience to Superiors, in a straw lifting, in
things indifferent, and merely positive, and not necessary to salvation, be
more obligatorie, then the precept of God, in the law of nature, in a matter
necessary to salvation, as a Commandment of God forbidding soul-murther, and
scandalizing him for whom Christ died? Or thus; Whether am I obliedged rather
to obey God, forbidding me to murder my brother, or to obey man, commanding me
to kneel toward Bread and Wine, and to cross the air with my thumb upon
the face of a baptized infant. Tannern* to 3. in 22. dis. 2. q. 6 dub. 9.

2. The question seems to make a collision of Commandments, as if God could
command things contradictorie, and certainly, if the not obeying of Pearth
Articles be a scandal given, as you say, it is* I shall undertake to prove,
that the practice of these Ceremonies is a Scandal given, and so it is not a
seeming strait as you say, but a real strait by your doctrine. There be cases
wherein, whether Rulers command things, or command the contrary, a passive
scandal does arise, but because a passive Scandal, is the sin of the
scandal taker, and not of Rulers giving, the Church is not to regard it, as
Matthew* 11. 18* 19. The Jews are scandalized, at Christ's eating and drinking,
and are scandalized at John the Baptists not eating and drinking. But neither
Christ, nor John do culpably give scandal. But there can be no such exigence
of providence wherein nonpractising of your commanded Ceremonies, is a given
scandal, and the practicing of them is also a given scandal. Because (as D.
Bannes ^o. 3. in. 22. q. 43. art. 8. con. 3. Talis perplexitas est absurdum
quid.
Bannes, and our own Amesius de Cons. lib. 5. ^^p. 11 these 18 Nulla datur
tali^ perplexita^, etc.
Am^sius says* There is not such a perplexiti^. 1. God should have brought a
man then in some cases under an absolute necessity, by way of contradiction to
sin, and murder his brother, whether he do such a thing or not do it. 2.
Twenty Jews are scandalized, Romans 14. Because Paul eats such and such
meats, which they conceive are forbidden by Gods law. And twenty Christians
are scandalized, because Paul eats not such and such meats, then we suppose,
and its very casual, for seeing, to be scandalized arises from the knowledge
or ignorance of the mind, and diverse men may have contrary opinions about one
thing. Some think it unlawful for Paul to eat, some think it unlawful not
to eat. Hence upon the use of a thing indifferent, twenty are scandalized, and
upon the non-using of that same indifferent thing, twenty are also
scandalized. What shall Paul do in this strait. I answer, he takes Romans 14. 1
Cor. 8. the negative. I will not eat flesh, if meat offend my brother. Then the
twenty that are scandalized by the non-practice of the thing indifferent, do
take scandal only, whereas Paul gives no scandal actively. Also, the othet
twenty who are scandalized by Paul his practice of the thing indifferent, are
justly scandalized, and it is both a scandal taken, and active, and a scandal
given and passive. Some object, but if either of the sides be indifferent, to
wit, either to use a thing indifferent, or not to use it. If ten take offense
at the use of it, and ten take offense at the non-use of it, there is a
necessity of scandalizing either of the sides, for the twenty weak
Christians are scandalized at Paul's abstinence from such meats, conceiving that
he Judaizeth, whereas the Profession of his Christian liberty in eating would
edify them, and not scandalize them.

Answer. The use of a thing indifferent is not Gods lawful mean of
edification, God has appointed his Word, Works, the holy and blameless
profession of his children to edify, and not the using of actions indifferent,
yea, actions indifferent as they are such, and separated from necessity, and
moral reason, are not lawful, and so the cessation from that action is
lawful and necessary, and if the use scandalize, non-using of things
indifferent, is not indifferent, but necessary, as non-scandalizing, and
negative precepts always binding, abstinence, with Paul is necessary. It is
vain that Paybodie says, that Peter was Gal. 2. in danger of a double
scandal, for (says he) he was in danger to scandalize the Gentiles, in
refusing their company, as if they had been no brethren, which was the greater
scandal, and in danger to scandalize the Jews in eating with the Gentiles,
which was a less sin, and less scandal. But I answer, Paul did not then
justly rebuke his Judaizing, Galat. 2. which does gratify Barronius,
Bellarmine, and Papists, who will have Peter, an Apostle who could not err. 2.
It should follow that Paul rebuked Peter, because that of two evils of sin,
he choosed to commit the lesser sin. Whereas of two evils of sin, neither
is to be chosen. One might then lawfully commit fornication to be free of
adultery. and so fornication should be lawful, which is absurd. And Paul
should call Gal. 2. 14. it upright walking according to the truth of the
Gospel to choose a less sin. 3. Peter by eating with the Gentiles, should not
have scandalized the Jews, but edified them, in showing the Christian liberty
they had in Christ, as is clear, v. 5. To whom we gave no subjection, no not
for an hour (by practicing Jewish Ceremonies) that the truth of the Gospel
might continue with you.

Duplyers page 66.
It is certain we are freed from one of these precepts, for Gods precepts are
not repugnan^ one to another. Ye commonly say, the precept of obedience to
humane authority, must give place to the precept of eschewing Scandal, though
it be causlesly taken, because the command of a Superior cannot make that fact
to be free of scandal, which otherwise would be scandalous. But it is
certain, that (laying aside the case of scandal) to deny obedience to the
ordinance of our Superiors, injoyning and peremptorily requiring of us* things
lawful and expedient, is really the sin of disobedience. Ye will say, that
the scandal of weak brethren, may make that fact or omission* not to be
disobedience, which otherwise would be disobedience; because we ought not for
the Commandment of man. do that whereby our weak brother may be offended:
and so the precept of obedience binds not, when offense of a weak brother
may be feared. On the contrary we say* that the lawful commandment of
Superiors, may make that scandal of our weak brethren, not to be imputed
unto us, which otherwise would be imputed unto us, as a matter of our
guiltiness. No scandal ^f weak brethren causlesly taken, can make that fact,
not to be the sin of disobedience, which otherwise, that i^ extra casum
scandali, if it were not in the case of scandal, would be the sin of
disobedience.

Answer. 1. This is right down work. But 1. I Answer, Both the precepts are
not obligatorie, you say true. We commonly say (says the Doctors) that the
precept of obedience to humane authority, must give place to the precept of
eschewing scandal, although it be causlesly taken. We say not that Commonly,
nor at all, if by Scandal causlesly taken, you mean scandal passive, only
taken, and not given, for we are not to regard such scandalls. But here the
scandal is given in that, we must practice base Ceremonies, indifferent knots
of straws for men's pleasure, though from thence many souls for whom Christ
died, be destroyed. 2. It is good reason that the precept of obedience to
humane authority in things which you call indifferent, and might well be sent
away to Rome (were it not the Lord Prelates pleasure to command them, for their
own carnal* ends) should yield and be gone, and lose all obligatorie power,
because it is but a positive precept, and 2. affirmative, that obliedgeth not
ad semper, as Cross^, kneel, wear Surplice. And 3. In a thing indifferent,
and that this Divine Commandment of God, (scandalize not) (kill not one
redeemed by Christ) should stand in force. 1. Because it is a natural precept.
2. It is negative, and obliedgeth eternally. 3. It is of a necessary matter,
because no manslayer has life eternal, 1 Jh. 3. 15. But our Doctors will
have the Commandments positive of men to stand, and the Commandments of God,
which are expressly of the law of nature to fall before their Dagon, and to lose
all obligatorie power, whereas Gods own positive law yeildeth, and loses
obligatorie power, when Gods natural Commandment of mercy comes in
competition with it, as is clear as the noonday, in David famishing, who eat
the Shewbread, which by a positive law, was not lawful to any save the
Priests only, to eat, yet must man's law stand, and Gods law of nature fall, at
the pleasure of these Doctors. 3. We say justly, you err in saying it is
real disobedience to deny obedience to the ordinance of Superiors, when the
matter of their law is indifferent, and when it is scandalous, and obedience
cannot be given to it, but by s^aying him for whom Christ died, yea, to give
obedience to Superiors in that case, is real murdering of souls, and real
disobedience to God. Yea, and if there be murdering of a weak brother in the
fact, it cannot come under the compass of the matter of an humane law, and the
Scandal makes it no obedience to men, but disobedience to God. 4. You retort
bravely, but Popishly, the argument back upon us; But we bring our argument
from the law of Nature ( Thou shall not murder, nor scandalize) and we bring
it not so much against the obedience to the Commandment of Superiors, as
against the law and Commandment of Superiors, and this Argument is against
the Ceremonies, as if they had not been commanded, and as they were before the
Assembly of Pearth, and therefore the consideration of a lawful Commandment
to take away the scandal, is not to any purpose. And so 5. I may invite
Papists, Jesuits, and all the Patrons of the Pope, to thank you, and kiss
your pen, for these words we say that the lawful Commandment of Superiors
(of Prelates commanding things indifferent) may make that scandal of our weak
brethren not to be imputed unto us, which otherwise would be imputed unto us,
as a matter of our guiltiness. What ever (my brethren) may be imputed to you
otherwise, and before the law of Pearth Assembly was made, as the matter of
your guiltiness, was your sin, for nothing can be imputed to Men or Angels,
as guiltiness, but fin. But if the Commandments of Prelates may make that not
to be imputed to you, which otherwise and before, or without that law of
Superiors, would have been imputed as the matter of your guiltiness, then the
law of Superiors and Prelates may make that, which without that law, would
have been sin, to be no sin at all. I know no more said by Bellarm. contra
Barcla. cap. 31. In bono sensu Christus dedit Petro (Papae) potestatem faciend^
de peccato non peccatum, and de non peccato peccatum.
Bellarmine of the Universal Prelate of the world, but that he can make sin to
be no sin, and no sin to be sin. And Bellar. de Romano Pontif. l. 4. cap
5.
that the Pope cannot command virtue as vice, and vice as virtue, for if he
should do so, the Church should be obliged to believe virtue to be vice, and
vice to be virtue. But much good do it you, Masters of Arts. Yet Bellarmine in
his recognitions, says not so much of his great Pope-Prelate, as you say of
your little Prelates, for Bellarm. in Recognit o^ibus. L^quuti sumus de actibus
dubiis viriu^um and vitiorum, nam si perciperet manifestum vitium, aut
prohiberet manifestum virtutem dicendum esset cum Petro, Act. 5. Obedire
oportet magis Deo, quam h^minibus -- dicimus posse jubere ut tali die non
jejunetur, -- non potest autem jubere ut non colatur Deu^.
he will not give the foresaid power to the Pope, but in doubtsome acts, and in
acts of positive laws about fasting, you give to Prelates more, to wit, that
their commanding will, may make sins forbidden in the law of nature, to be
not imputed, as the matter of our guiltiness, and to be no sins; We cannot
want dispensations and indulgences at home, ere it be long, if happily we pay
well for them.

Yet Bernardus Epist. 7. Quomodo ergo vel Abbatis jussio vel Papae permissio,
licit^^^ facere potuit, quod purum malum fuit.
Bernard will not have the Popes commandment to make that which is simply
evil to be lawful. Toletus in ^nstruct. Secerdo^. lib 5. cap* 3. cum causa
rationabili aliquid praecipitur -- ^os debemus audire, nec Pap^ pro suo li^ito
excusat.
The Popes pleasure make not things good (says Tolet) yea, a subject (says
Alphonsus de potest legis Civil. cap. 5. Conclus. 5. Potest subd^^ ^^ sin^
peccato legem aut preceptum superioris* contem^^re, judicando ill^^ ma^^^ and
contra r^^ionem.
Alphonsus d^^^astro) may without sin contemn the law of his Superior,
judging it to be evil, and contrary to reason.

But I reason thus; It is the incommunicable power of the Supreme Law* giver
to make the killing of Isaac, which otherwise would have been imputed to
Abraham as a matter of guiltiness, and cruelty, to be no sin. Ergo,
Prelates have not power to make an act of soul*murther, to be no sin, to
scandalize a weak brother is to destroy him, for whom Christ died, Romans 14. v.
15. 1 Cor. 8. v. 11. yea, and by the same law Rulers may make an act of
Adultery, an act of Chastity, an act of lying, an act of truth speaking.

2. If Rulers, even the Apostle Paul, be tied by the law of Nature, to Charity
to their brethren, as Romans 14. 15. Not to stay him for whom Christ died, not to
se^ke their own things, but the good of their brethren, 1 Cor. 10. 24. Not to
eat things sacrificed to idols, before the weak, v. 29. To do all for the
glory of God, v. 32. Then is it sin in the Ruler himself to scandalize the
weak. Ergo, Rulers cannot command to others that as obedience, which they
cannot do themselves without prodigious disobedience to God. What Paul
forbids in Canonical Scripture as murder, that he cannot command in Church
Canons as obedience Canonical to Superiors.

3. Prelates shall have immediate Dominion over our consciences to bind us to
obedience by doing acts that otherwise should be imputed to ^s as the matter of
our guiltiness; and because the same power that binds the conscience, may
also loose, so they may dispense with all the ten Commandments, and coin to
us a new Decalogue, and a new Gospel. They may legitimate murders, paricides,
and illegitimate Godliness* and right^^^snesse and sobri^ti^, by this
Divinity.

4. That must be false ( It is better to obey God nor man, Act. 5.) but to
abstain from scandalizing a weak brother, is an act of obedience to the sixth
Commandment. Ergo, the contrary cannot be done at the command of Prelates. 6.
Gods positive laws yeildeth (Thou shall not kill) to wit to the law of nature.
David may eat show bread, when he is famishing. Ergo, the Prelates law far
more must yield to the sixth Commandment (thou shall not scandaliz^, nor kill
the soul of him for whom Christ died.) 7. Rulers must all be infallible
lawmakers. 8. Rulers might command bodily murder, and it should not be
murder, they may command to dig pitts in the way of Travelers, To marry
with Infidel^, to send abroad a goaring Ox, to give knives to little children.

They object. A Master a father, may command a servant and a son to do that,
which if the servant or son refuse to do, their disobedience scandalizeth. And
again, a Master, a Father, may command the contrary, and if they disobey, they
scandaliz^ culpably. Erg. The commanding will of a Master and a Father, and
far more of public Rulers, may make that to be active scandal, which is no
active scandal. A Carpenter may command his servant to remove a tree from the
East end of his house, to the West end, and again, he may for his sole will,
to try his servants obedience, command him to remove it again to the East end
of his house.

Answer. 1. The Master, Father, Carpenter, command either these things as
artificial agents, from reason of art, and then the question is not touched,
for in scandalls men are considered, as moral agents, or they command them as
moral agents, and that either for their sole will and pleasure, and so they be
idle and unreasonable actions, and cannot be lawful commandments, and so are
they scandalous both to Commanders and obeyers, but they may well command upon
just reasons, that which if servants and sons obey not, they give Scandal,
and they may command the contrary of that same, at another time, when now
contrary reasons makes it lawful and expedient, and if servants and sons
obey not the contrary, they also give Scandal, but here the change is not from
the will and authority of the Commanders, but from the things themselves,
which are changed, so that which is an active scandal at some time, the
contrary of it may be an active scandal at another time, as in the ease, Romans
14. To eat meats before the weak, which they conceive to be forbidden, by Gods
law, is to slay him for whom Christ died, and an active scandal, because then
the Ceremonies were mortal and indifferent, nothing essentially constituteth
an active and a given scandal, but these two; 1. That The essence of an active
or given scandal.
it may be left undone, as the author of the course of conformity, Course of
conformity, page 147.
says well out of Hieronimus, Without hurting of the truth of a sound life,
and a sound faith and righteousness. 2. If upon the practice of a thing
indifferent, and not necessary, any of the foresaid three ways, we see some
shall be scandalized, though (b) Dimittendum est, propter scandalum, ^om^e quod
potest praetermitti, salva triplice veritate vitae doctrinae and justi^iae,
Hierony. Gl^ssord. tom. 9.
they take scandal upon an unjust ground, it is an active scandal, as to eat
such meats before the weak, Romans 14. is in another time and case, as Galat. 2.
when the Ceremonies are now deadly, and upon just reasons not necessary, the
practicing (I say) of the same, is an active scandal and so if any be
scandalized at the eating, Romans 14. it is scandal both taken, and also
culpably given, and if any be scandalized at the not eating, as the case is,
Galat. 2. That is only a passive scandal, and so not given, because the times
of the expyring of the duty of Ceremonies, and the full promulgation of the
Gospel, varieth the case now, and the sole will of Rulers makes not the
change; So if any offer Incence to the Brazen Serpent, so long as it has
virtue, as Gods ordinance to cure the stinged persons, he is scandalized by a
passive scandal only, for Gods institution makes it now the necessary
ordinance of God, And the Magistrates suffering of the Brazen Serpent to
remain now, is no active scandal, and the passive scandal is only taken
away, by information, and the sound exponing of the right use of a necessary
ordinance of God. But after that the Brazen Serpent loses its virtue, and is
not now an ordinance of God necessary, if any burn Incense to it, these who
are by authority obliedged to remove it, and does not remove it, they do
morally and culpably scandalize.

Hence we see it is foolish and vain, that some say, such as Hooker of Eccles^
Policy, l. 4* page 157.
Hooker. D. Forbes in Iren. lib. 2. c. 20. n. 19.
D. Forbes. Sandersons Sermon, Romans 14 page 22. 23.
D. Sanderson, and Lyndesay his defense of Pearth Assemb. in Prafat Paybodie.
Lyndesay, pretended Bishop of Edinburge, and Mr. Paybodie. That as Rome and
Corinth the Church had not past her determination upon eating, and not eating,
nor made any Church laws upon these things indifferent, and therefore to eat,
or not to eat, were matters of every private man's choice; But it is not the
like case with our Ceremonies, for they remain no longer indifferent, but are
necessary to us, after that the Church has now made a commanding law upon
them, and so the scandal that arises from our duty of obedience, to lawful
authority, is taken, and not given.

I answer, it is most false, that eating and not eating, in case of scandal
was under no law in the Church of Rome and Co* rinth. For these most
indifferent acts in their use, and clothed with their Circumstances, when,
where, and before what persons, were under the unalterable law of nature, as (
destroy not him, with thy meat for whom Christ died) a law which as the Course
of Conformity, page 146.
course of conformity says well, cannot be dispensed with by no power but
Gods. And Paul proves by stronger arguments, to eat in the case of Scandal,
was not indifferent, but simply evil, Then all the Prelates Canons on earth
can afford, as Romans 14. by eight Arguments, as we have seen, that it fights
against Charity, v. 15. Now walk thou not charitably. 2. It is a destroying
of him for whom Christ died, and so murder. 3. Contrary to Christ's love, who
died for that weak brother. 4. It makes Religion and Christian Liberty to be
evil spoken of. v. 6. etc. It is a sham then to say, that eating, or not
eating, was indifferent, because free from any ty of a Church Canon, seeing
eating before a weak brother is under the ty of unanswerable Arguments taken
from the law of nature, and Gods Canons written in the heart, forbidding under
the pain of Goa's anathema, and curse, (heavier then the Church anathema,) that
we should, for meat, destroy him for whom Christ died, and so are the
Canon-makers, and Lords of Ceremonies under a curse, if they for crossing,
kneeling, surplice, destroy him for whom Christ died, or command him to be
destroyed, by the practice of Ceremonies. 3. If this be a good reason the
Church of Rome, and Corinth might have made such Ceremonies as these.

Notwithstanding the eating of meats, which some suppose to be forbidden by
Gods law, be a killing of him for whom Christ died, and against Charity* and a
reproaching of our Christian liber^ie, yet it seemed good to the holy Ghost,
and to us, the Prelates of Rome and Corinth, to command eating of such meats,
before weak ones, for whom Christ died. But certainly Paul would never have
command^d, in a Canon, that which he writes in Canonical Scripture, to be a
murdering of him for whom Christ died, and that which he would not practice
himself, to the worlds end, so long as it stands in the case of
indifferency, as he says of eating of fleshes, conceived by some weak ones
to be against Gods law, 1 Cor. 8. v. last, The Pope himself would, nor dare in
conscience, to practice any of his own Canons, even though they were yet not
Canonically commanded or forbidden. Paul would not dare to put a law upon the
Romans or Corinthians, to eat, or not to eat meats, before the weak, but
commands not eating in the case of scandal. 4. Idolatry is ever idolatry,
(says Page 143.
the course of conformity) and so scandal being sin it cannot cease to be
sin, because superiors commands it. 5. Though Apostolic authority being
merely divine, should command that which is in it self murder, and was
^urther, before it be Canonically commanded, (which I think also is a false
hypothesis) yet it shall never follow that humane authority, or Ecclesiastic
authority can command scandal, which is spiritual murder; For if
Ecclesiastic authority may command murder, they may command idolatry, for
active scandalizing is as essentially murdering of one for whom* Christ died,
as to worship an idol, is essentially idolatry. Therefore Master Sydserfe
pretended Bishop of Gall^way being straited with this argument, said, Though
humane authority cannot invert the nature of things, or make spiritual
murder, to be no murder, yet they can by a Church Canon put the minds of
people in such a change, as now they are not in the hazard to be justly
scandalized* for a scandal (said the Prelate)* is ens rationis, no real thing
but a fiction of reason, the nature of it being in the apprehension of the
ignorant and blind, who are scandalized, and a law may remove this ignorance,
when it gives light, and shows the expediencie of things indifferent. To
which I answered, you may, call idolatry, if you please, and all sins,
fictions of reason, but not only does scandal given proceed from ignorance and
blindness of the apprehension of the party scandalized, but also from the
unseasonable practicing of a thing, which is no ways necessary in the worship
of God. The course of Course of Conformity. page 143.
confirmitie says well, He that denies that there is any scandal, is like
one who could not see the wood, for the trees -- the walking of Diogenes is
meetest for a Zeno, who against all reason denies that there is any motion. We
may hence judge what to say of Forbes Iren. l. 2. cap. 20. n. 6.
D. Forbes his Answer to the place, 1 Cor. 9. Who says that Paul was under no
Ecclesiastical law, not to take wages, and therefore in not taking wages, he
was not a contemner of Ecclesiastical authority, but we are under a Church
law to practice the Ceremonies, and yet we refuse them. I answer; If then the
Church of Corinth had commanded Paul in their Canons to take stipend, for
preaching, he was obliedged to take stipend, yet he proves that it was not
lawful for him, as the case of scandal then stood, to take wages, v. 18. he
should abuse his power in the Gospel, and v. 19. 20, 21. he should not have
becommed all things to all men to save some, and these things had been sinfully
scandalous, if (as the case was then) Paul for a penny of wages, which he might
have wanted, having no family to provide for, should have laid a stumling
block before many. And the Doctor Forbes, lib. 2. cap. 20. n. 19. Non potest
humana potestas te cogere ad faciendam illud quod facere non possis absque
inevitabilidatione scandali.
^aith No humane power can compel a man, to do that, which he cannot do,
except inevitably he give scandal. The Doctor adds; The Apostle teaches not
that to take stipend was unlawful, or of it self scandalous, yea he taught it
was lawful, and that they should not be scandalized thereat, because Christ
has ordained, that he who serves at the altar, should live upon the Altar,
but you teach that the Ceremonies are unlawful. I Answer 1. In this argument
of Scandal, we give, but do not grant, that they are not unlawful, but
indifferent. 2. Though to take wages be lawful, yet it follows not, that it
is not in Paul's ca^e at Corinth of it self scandalous; for to eat all meats
is lawful, Romans 14. and 1 Cor. 10. 23. All things are lawful, v. 26. The
earth is the Lords, yet to eat before the weak, was in it self scandalous,
Romans 14. 15. 16. 17. 1 Cor. 10. 28. 29. 3. It is a most weak reason to prove
that to take wages was not scandalous, because for^ooth the Corinthians should
not have been scandalized: for to be scandalized is to sin, and there is no
reason in sinning, (...). If this be good, adultery and murder in David, is
not of it self scandalous, for as no man has reason to sin, so no man has
reason to be scandalized, at David's sin. Paul's taking wages at Corinth should
have been a sinful hindering of the Gospels progress, and therefore of it
self sinful; and so of it self scandalous. But I return to the Doctors.

Duplyers page 67. 68. n. 46 47.
As for that which ye say, that when Scandal may be taken at the doing of the
thing commanded, then the thing commanded becomes inexpedient, and so ought
not to be obeyed; that ye be not more deceived with this error, we pray you
mark, that a thing commanded, by our Superiors, in Church or Policy, may be
two ways inexpedient, to wit, either in respect of some particular Persons,
who through weakness, or mali^e, do stumble at it, or else in respect of the
body in general, because it is contrary to Order, Decency and Edification. If
the thing commanded be inexpedient, the former way, we may indeed, in such a
case, for eschewing the Scandal of the weak, forbear the practice of the
thing commanded, Hic, and nunc, in some particular places, and times: provyding
always we do this without offense of our Superiors, and without the scandal
of others, but we cannot totally forbear practice, for we are to look more to
the utilitie, which the body of the Church may receive, by the thing commanded,
and by our obedience to our Superiors, then to some particular persons. 47.
But if the thing commanded be in our private judgment inexpedient, the other
way, we ought not for that, to deny Obedience to the laws of the Church; for
when the inexpediencie of a thing is questionable, and probable arguments may
be brought, pro and contra, concerning the expediencie of it, we have
sufficient warrant to practice it, if the Church inact it as expedient.
Otherwise your way is so dangerous, that there shall never be peace, nor
unity in the Church, for men ordinarily are divided in judgment, concerneing
the expediencie of things. Suppose a Synod consisting of one hundred Pastors,
threescore shall think this particular Ceremony expedient, for the good of the
Church, and in respect of plurality of voices* make an act to be concluded for
the establishing of it, shall the remnant forty, who are of the contrary
judgment, deny obedience to the acts of the Synod?

Answer. 1. This distinction of inexpedient in the matter of indifferent
Ceremonies is Popish and vain, for if the Ceremony be indifferent, and may be
wanted in the worship of God (as these Ceremonies be) if one soul, for whom
Christ died, shall be murdered thereby, it is hoc ipso, to be judged
inexpedient and scandalous in it self, and so cannot fall under the object of
a Church Canon, as 1 Cor. 8. 13. If meat make my brother to stumb'le (he says
not the whole Church) I will not eat. Ergo, he cannot command others to eat. 1
Cor. 10. 28. But if any man, (...), say to you, this is offered in sacrifice to
Idols, eat not, (...), for his sake that showed it. Ergo, if it seem expedient,
and so be scandalous to one, let alone to a whole Church, we are totally to
forbear it, and Paul would, while the world stands, 1 Cor. 8. 13. forbear
it. 2. You will not have us to forbear a thing indifferent, that actively (for
the passive scandal, I hope, you regard not as a scandal) does scandalize,
but with a provision that we do it without offense of Superiors, and without
the scandal of others. But I ask, Doctors, what you mean by Offense of
Superiors, if you mean without displeasing and inciting our Superiors to
anger. 1. You ignorantly confound displeasing and Scandalizing, When a Pastor
rebukes Superiors, as Jeremiah, Elias, and John Baptist, in the good old
world did, they did displease Superiors, but not scandalize them; yea, they
did edify their Superiors, while as they did offend them. It is wicked
Divinity, to mean, that we are not to eschew the murdering of a weak brother
for whom Christ died providing we offend not, that is, displease not our
Superiors. Will you to please men displease the God of heaven, and commit
spiritual homicide? This is worse then Popery.

But if you mean, that we are to forbear the thing commanded for eschewing
the scandal of the weak, providing we do it without the offense of
Superiors, that is without the active scandalizing of Superiors, then 1. your
distinction is vain, for if we scandalize culpably our superiors by our
forbearance, though it be inexpedient to all private persons, we are not to
forbear, because in no case can we break the sixth Commandment, and
scandalize our Superiors. 2. You shall be forced to give^ case, wherein we are
necessitated by Gods providence, and that by way of contradiction, whether we
forbear, or forbear not, to murder either the souls of some weak ones, or
the souls of Superiors, by our forbearance of the practice of things judged
expedient by Superiors, you make us to murder the souls of Superiors by the
non-forbearance, or you will have us to murder the souls of weak breathren,
if we practice. This is a wronging of Providence, and a Ma^ichean tenent, that
we can be under such a necessity of sinning. Yea, there must be two centra^y
revealed wills in God, commanding, by forbearing the Ceremonies, not to murder
Superiors, and commanding by not forbearing, not to murder weak brethren; and
so God commands both to forbear, and also not to forbear. If you say, the
weak may be informed, and then it is a passive scandal only, and practicing
is lawful at the commandment of Superiors. I answer, 1. Then your
distinction has no use here. 2. I answer. Let the Superiors, who have more
knowledge, be informed, that to abstain from a practice, that may murder any
one redeemed by Christ, is Christ's commandment ( Thou shall do no murder)
then it is but a passive scandal, and not an active, or culpably given
scandal. Ergo, we are to forbear the thing commanded for eschewing of the
scandal* (hic and nunc) of the weak, even though with the offense, that is
the passive scandal of Superiors and others, which is contradictorie to the
Doctors. 3. If we may forbear obedience to Gods positive Commandments, hic
and nunc, for esehewing of Scandal, far more may we, hic and nunc, not
cross, not kneel, hic and nunc, when crossing and kneeling murthereth one for
whom Christ died, even though it offend our Superiors. Ergo, this provision of
the Doctors is vain; and Superiors are unjustly offended, if our
nonmurthering of weak brethren offend them, nor are we to care for the Doctors
provision here. 4. No utilitie can truly redound to the whole Church by
practicing of an indifferent thing which culpably occasioneth the murdering of
a weak brother, Except our Doctors mean, that sin may edify the whole
Church. 5. They say, if the things in our private judgment be inexpedient the
second way, that is to the Church, the Church cannot Command them, except the
Church command against her conscience. 6. If matters in their expediencie be
questionable and probable on both sides, the Churches determination should end
the controversy (says the Doctors) this is the Doctrine of the Jesuits,
Suarez de Rel. to. 4. l 4* tract* 5. cap 15. Si, sec^us^ praecept^, res ex
^tr^que ^a^te sit probabilis tunc universaliter verum erit adjuncto
praeceptoobedi ^dum esse.
Suarez. Thom. Sanchez ^n Decalog* to. 2. lib 6. cap. 3. n. 3.
Thomas Sanches, and Greg. de Val. ^^ 3. disp 7 q 3 punct. 2
Gregor de valent. as I show before Supra q. 6. of this Treatise.
when a thing is probable, and I be resolved in conscience against neither of
the sides, and fear the one side be murdering him, for whom Christ died,
which is against Gods commandment, and know that humane authority commands
the contrary and am persuaded it is indifferent, and a positive commandment of
men, if the Churches determination be here to sway my conscience; to practice,
is to me blind obedience, for humane authority as it is such, gives no light.
Ergo, it cannot remove my doubting, and beget faith; and also the conscience is
so much the bolder to venture on a sin, against God, for fear of eschewing a
sin against men, which is questionable, and in a matter indifferent, this is
also the stout conscience of Bonaventura 2 sent. did. 39. plus est standum
praecepto Praelati quam conscientiae. 7. Our Doctors say, our way is against
the peace of the Church: But I answer, their way is Popish, and against the
truth of God, in commanding our consciences to rest upon the wicked will of
men. And their instance of a Synod of a hundred Pastors may be brought as well
to prove the Synod of Trent is to be obeyed, as for the present purpose,

Duplyers, page 69.
Ye will say this argument is Popish, and leads men to acquiesce. without
trial, upon the determination of the Church. But we answer in matters of faith
the truth, whereof may be infallibly concluded out of the word of God* we ought
not, without trial to acquiesce unto the Doctors of the Church, and in this
respect we dissent from Papists, who ascribe too much to the authority of
Counsels, as if their decrees were infallible. But in matters of Policy, if
we be certain, that in their own nature, they are indifferent, and if the
expediencie of them only be called in question, seeing no certain conclusion,
concerning their expediencie, can be infallibly drawn out of Gods word -- we
are to acquiesce to the decrees of the Church. 1. Because otherwise it is
impossible to agree in one conclusion, in matters of this kind. 2. Disobedience
shall prove more hurtful then obedience.

Answer 1. This is a wide step, to make all things in Scripture, either matters
of faith, or matters indifferent. That there were eight persons in Noah's Arc,
and that Sampson s^ew a thousand with the jaw bone of an ass, are not matters
of faith, as matters of faith are contradistinguished, from things indifferent,
many are saved, who neither know nor believe many things of this historical
verity in Scripture, yet are they not matters indifferent. But the Doctors are
reconcilers with the Belgik Arminians, who deny all the things contraverted
betwixt Papists and us, and betwixt us and Arminians, and Anabaptists, at least
the most part of them to be fundamental* and that either side may be believed,
and holden, without hazard of salvation, and therefore we are to lean to the
Churches determination in these without farther inquiry. 2 They mean, that in
matters contraverted, and in all things indifferent; as whether in this, or
that fact, we do murder him for whom Christ died; We are to give our faith
and conscience over to the Church without further trial. 3. What if we be*
not persuaded of the indifferency of the things commanded but doubt whether
they be commanded or forbidden in the Word, as is now the present case of
Ceremonies to us, for we cannot be persuaded of their indifferency, and the
Doctors says they are not matters of faith. Ergo, by their own doctrine their
distinction is defective. 4. Scripture is also perfect in resolving us, what is
scandal and murdering of our brother, as what is Idolatry and Blasphemy,
and therefore we are not to hang our faith here upon the Churches Canons
without farther trial, as you say. 5. That the Scripture is perfect in matters
of faith, but imperfect in matters of Policy, that is in matters wherein we
may kill him for whom Christ died, is no better then the Papists distinction,
who teach us that the Scripture is perfect in the articles of faith, not in
traditions, so Scotus Scotus prol. in sent. q. 3. ad art. 3.
says. True Theology according to Divine revelation is only of things in
Scripture, or which may be deduced out of Scripture. And Suarez Suarez 10. ^e
leg. cap. 1. and de trip. vi^^. Theology, Tract. 1. disp. ^. q. ^.
says, Things that belong to accidentarie rites are left to the Churches
determination, but the Scripture implicitly contains all articles of fear
faith. And so says Banne^, tom. in q 1. ^^^ 10. dub 2.
Bannes, and Duvallius, 2 tract. de legib q 5. art. 1. ^d ar^ 2.
Duvallius. 6. Your fear is vain, that we shall have no order nor peace, if
Scripture be judge, and not the authority of the Church, in matters which you
call indifferent, for the Church gives out Canons concerning things strangled,
and blood, which were matters indifferent, and that from the word of God, Act.
15. and that in great unity and peace. Gods word makes unity, and not men's
authority. 7. Disobedience to Church Canons in case of given Scandal, is
neither disobedience, nor hurts at all; It possibly offends men who will
tyrannize over the Conscience, and if any be induced thereby to sin, it is a
scandal taken, not given. Abstinence from murdering a weak brother, is
obedience to God, and so no active Scandal.

In the 48 Section* The Duplyers do but redouble over again the arguments
already brought and answered by me diverse times to D* Robert Barron in private,
while he was silenced, and (as I conceived) satisfied. Especially, they say our
disobedience to superiors in things lawful and expedient, is most scandalous
to others, and that because we, by nature, are most unwilling to be curbed, and
to have our liberty restrained. Therefore Calvin Calv. in In^^^. ^u^^. 2 cap.
8. sect. 35.
says, God, that he may allure us to obedience to ^^^^riours, called,
superiors, Parents.

I answer. 1. The Doctors are too hasty to call that obedience to Superiors
which is in question, We say it is disobedience to the ^ixt Commandment,
because it is a scandalizing of our brother. Ergo, it is not obedience to the
fifth Commandment to practice indifferent Ceremonies, when they do scandalize.
2. Our argument is made against the practice of Ceremonies, before they be
enacted in a lawful Assembly, if they be murdering of the weak, before
Pearth-Assemblie, the will of Prelates, yea, and all the authority of men or
Angels, cannot make the practice of them, to be no murder, for men's will
cannot make that which is sin and guiltiness before God, to be no sin, but
due obedience to the fifth Commandment, though the Doctors expressly say this.

Duplyers, page 71. Sect. 44.
But we with good warrant ^oe aver, that the precept which fobiddeth the
resisting of the civil power, and in general the denying of obedience to the
lawful commandments of our Superiors, is of greater obligation then the
precept of not scandalizing. Their first reason I put in form to them thus.
That is of greater obligation which commands acts edificative to all, then
that which commands acts edificative to some only, for the good of all is to
be preferred to the good of some particular persons, and we are to have a
greater care of the salvation of all, then of some. But the precept of
obedience to Superiors is universal, and commands the act of edifying all
to wit, obedience to Superiors, and an act to eschew the scandal of all to
wit, disobedience. But the precept of eschewing the scandal of some, does but
edify some only, and not all Ergo etc.

Ans. 1. It is soon proved by your learning, for the precept of Gods law to
eschew scandal, to you is no precept, and so of no obligation, when Superiors
command to scandalize, so you may prove that snow is whiter then the raven,
when as the raven is not white at all.

I answer. 2. That precept is of greater obligation that commands acts
edificative to all, then that which commands acts edificative to some. It is
true, 1. if it be a lawful command of God, but the ^ssumption applied to your
purpose is most false, the command to obey Prelates, when they command things
indifferent, the obedience whereof does culpably occasion the murdering of
him, for whom Christ died, is not a commandment edificative to all, yea, it is
a Commandment of acts destructive to the souls of all. This Argument would
have some color, if it were not a vain begging of the question, for they lay
down as, confessed, that the practice of Ceremonies, from whence many souls
are ruined, is obedience, and obedience to the fifth Commandment. This is to be
proven, and constantly denied by us, because disobedience to the sixth
Commandment, and murdering of our brother, cannot be obedience to the fifth
Commandment.

Duplyers page 72. n. 50.
The fifth Commandment comes nearer to the nature of piety Ames. M^dull. l.
2 c. 17. sect. 13.
and religion contained in the first Table, and the honoring of parents (as
your own A^^^sius says) by profane authors, is called by the name of
religion and piety. 2. It is the ground of obedience (says Pareus) to be
given to all the rest of the precepts of the second Table. 1. Because all
societies Oeconomicke, civil, and Ecclesiasticke do consist, and are
conserved by the subjection of ^nferiours to superiors. 2. Our superiors are
set over us, to the end, we may do our duty to all others. Hence says your
own Amesius; Crimes which directly procure the perturbation, confusion, and
eversion of societies, are more grievous then the violation of the singular
precepts: and Dyonisius Bishop of Alexandria, writing to Novatus says,
Martyrdom suffered for eschewing of schism, is more glorious, then Martyrdom
for eschewing Idolatry.

Ans. You said before matters of Policy are not matters of faith. Amesius is a
Protestant writer in matters of faith, by grant of all, it is like then you
term ^mesius our own, not yours, because he wrote against Arminians and
Papists, and so that Arminians and Papists are yours, and Protestant Divines
ours. 2. We grant the precedencie and dignity to the fifth Commandment above
the rest, but your Ceremonies that break the sixth Commandment, shall find no
room in the fifth Commandment. Cause the fifth Commandment speak thus, if you
can; Notwithstanding, that crossing, kneeling, surplice, humane holy days
occasion the soul murder of him for whom Christ died, yet we the Prelates
command the practice of the foresaid Ceremonies as good and expedient for
edification, for our Commandment makes the murdering of our brethren, to be
obedience to the fifth Commandment. But if Prelates may command that which
would be otherwise, without, or before the Commandment, spiritual murdering
and scandalizing of our brother, they may command also, that which would be
otherwise without, or before their command, adultery against the seventh, and
theft against the eighth, and perjurie and lying against the ninth
Commandment, and concupiscence against the tenth; for the fifth Commandment
has the precedencie before the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth Commandments,
no less then before the sixth, which forbids the killing of our brothers
soul. 3. What Amesius and Parens says, do well prove the dignity of the
fifth Commandment, above all the Commandments of the second Table; but this is
not to our purpose, but every commandment of the fifth Commandment; yea,
every commandment of the first Table, is not above every commandment of the
second Table. The love of God, is more then the love of our neighbor, and the
love of God should, and does, command obedience to all the ten Commandments,
Deuteronomy. 30. 6. 7, 8. and Deuteronomy. 10. 12. Yet every duty and commandment that the
love of God requires of us, as to offer sacrifice, is not for that a greater
commandment then every commandment of the second Table, yea, the taking of a
sheep out of a ditch on the Lords day, commanded in the sixth Commandment, is
more then sacrifices commanded in the second Commandment, as our Savior
says, Math. 12. v. 11, 12. and though the fifth Commandment be laid upon us as
the fountain and cause, yea to this end, that we should keep all the rest, as
Divines say well. Yet it follows not that every commandment of the fifth
Commandment, as when my father commands me to preach in a linen Ephod, and
to cast a Character with my thumb in the air, as crossing is, shall be of
more obligation then this commandment of God (Thou shall not destroy his soul
for whom Christ died) 4. It is false, that denying of obedience to
Pearth-Assemblie, commanding indifferent straws and feathers as (kneel to
consecrated Bread, the Image of Christ crucified) does directly procure the
perturbation and confusion of humane societies, as the Doctors says. There is
great difference betwixt subjection to superiors, and obedience to superiors;
When private men, as the three Children will not bow to Nebuchadnezzars Image,
there is no confusion brought in for that, if they had risen against the King
in arms, as Papists do in Ireland against our King, that is confusion, and
subverteth directly humane scocieties, but to suffer punishment by Superiors,
is subjection to superiors, as is clear, 1 Pet. 2. 17. Honor the King. 18.
Servan^s be subject to your Masters with all fear, not only to the good and
gentle but also to the froward. 19. For this is thanke-worthy (this subjection)
if a man, for conscience reward God* enaure grief, suffering wrongfully. 5.
What Dionysius said of the ill of schism is for us, for schism is against
love to our brethren, and a renting Christ's body. 1 Cor. 1. 13. and a greater
evil then non-obedience to Prelates, when they command indifferent Ceremonies,
occasioning the r^^ne of him for whom Christ died. To say nothing that the
Doctors of Aberdeen are the Schismatics who have now separated from the Church
of Scotland, and our National covenant with God.

Duplyers page 37. n. 51.
Thirdly, these offices or duties, which we owe to others by way of Justice,
are more strictly obligatorie, then these which we owe to them, only by way of
charity. But we owe the duty of obedience Melul. Theol. l. 2. c 16. s. 58 59.
60. 61. 62 63.
to our Superiors, by way of justice, and therefore it is more obligatorie,
then the duty of eschewing scandal causlesly taken, which is a duty only of
charity. 1. The major is a maxim not only of Scholasticks* and of Popish
casuists, but also of our Divines. So Amesius, The major is clear for the duty
of obedience which we owe to the public Laws of the Church and Kingdom is*
Justitia legalis, a general legal Justice, and as it is in subjects, it is a
virtue inclining them to the obedience of all laws made for the benefit of the
Commonwealth, as Aristotle says. 2. It is debitum obedientiae, the debt of
obedience which we owe to our Superiors, grounded upon the proper right which
our Superiors have to exact this right of us, so that they may accuse us of
injury, and censure us, if we perform it not. Debitum justitiae fundatur in
proprio jure alterius; and also it is debitum morale, a debt of duty unto
which we are tied by moral honesty in Gods commandment. There is a great
difference betwixt these two debts; As for example, a man owes moneys to the
poor by a moral debt, but to his creditours he owes them by a legal debt,
or debt of justice: and therefore he is more strictly obleiged to pay his
creditour then to give alms. Such like by moral honesty, and Gods precept
also; a man owes to his neighbor, a pious carfulness, to imped sin in
him, by admonition, instruction, good example, and by omission even of things
lawful, when he sees that his neighbor in respect of his weakness, will be
scandalized by them. But his neighbor has not such a right to exact these
duties of him, neither can he have action against him, for not performing of
them, as our lawful Superiors have for our due obedience?

Ans. 1. Here be the white shifts of Mr. Sanderson, Paybodie, Downham, who
place Loyalty above Charity. We owe to our brother love, but to the Ruler
(say they) love and justice. 1. Why do they not extend Loyalty to its utmost,
even loyalty to the King of kings? whose royal law says* ( Thou shale not
scandalize (Thou shall not murder) they draw in loyalty to Rulers who shall
die as men, and to their commandment of things indifferent, which God has not
commanded. 2. It is true, these duties which we owe to others by way of
justice, are more obligatorie then these which we owe only by way of charity,
caeteris paribus, When duties of the law of Nature, and moral Law, are
compared together, then indeed the duties which we owe, both by the tie of
Justice and Charity, are more obligatorie, then the duties that we owe only by
the tie of Charity. As for example; My father is in danger, before my eyes, to
be drowned, in one deep water; and before my eyes also, my neighbor and
friend is in danger of the like kind; the two ties and bands of Justice and
Charity, both by the fifth and sixth Commandments are more obligatorie, hic
and nunc, and do more strictly obliege, that I run to succor, and preserve
the life of my father, then the life of my neighbor, for the obligation to my
neighbor, is only charity, by the obligation of the sixth Commandment, which
obligation cease, hic and nunc, at this time, when my fathers life is in
hazard; and thus far the Doctors argument goes for strong, as Schoolmen,
Casuists, and Divines teach. But it is not to a purpose for the Doctors; For
all offices and duties generally, and universally, of what ever kind, which we
owe by way of Justice, are not more obligatorie, then duties which we owe, only
by way of Charity, as when duties of a positive commandment of God, enjoined
by our Superiors, and duties which we owe by charity only, are compared
together, then the Doctors major Proposition is not clear of it self, as they
dream, nor do Casuists or Amesius, or Divines say with them, but truth, and
all our Divines say against them. Let us suppose that the King, and
Convocation, and Assembly of Priests and Prophets of Israel make a Canon
according to Gods Word. That no manner of man presume to eat shewbread, save
the Priests only. All men owe obedience to this, both because it is Gods
express Law, and by the band of Justice, the Elders and Assembly of the
Ancients have forbidden it. But if our Doctors argument stand strong, David at
the point and hazard of famishing for hunger, sinned in eating shewbread, yet
Christ acquiteth him of all sin, and says Math. 12. 5. he and his followers
are (...), blameless. Now Davia was under a duty by mercy, and love to his
own life, and he lives of his followers, to eat shewbread, and he was under
the band of Justice, by the law of the Ancients of Israel, and Gods law, not to
eat. Therefore in some cases, when our Superiors commandments are only
positive Laws, they are not more obligatorie, then duties of Charity, only
commanded in the law of nature. I clear it further thus, I see my neighbor in
danger before my eyes of drowning, and my father commands me to go and
labor, or sow his farm in that time, while I am to preserve the life of my
neighbor in present danger, to lose his life, in a great water. By the Doctors
maxim I am under the higher obligatorie tie of Justice, to obey my father, who
commands a thing both lawful and necessary by virtue of the higher
Commandment, to wit, the first of the second Table, then I am obliged by the
sixth Commandment, and of charity only, to give present succor and help to
my dying neighbor, so I must let my neighbor die in the waters, to give a
duty of justice to my father, of far less necessity. I would not commit my
conscience to such Casuists, as are the Doctors of Aberdeen. But if the Doctors
would see with some new light of reason; it is clear, that not only the tie of
Justice makes the precept more obligatorie, but also the weightinesse of the
thing commanded; Yea, and if the positive Commandments of the Lord our God,
who of Justice and kingly soveraigntie* has right to ask obedience of us
above all earthly Superiors do yield and cede as less obligatorie, then
commandments of love only, that are commanded in the law of nature. What do
our Doctors clatter and fable to us of a right of Justice, that mortal Rulers
have to command in things indifferent, from which the destruction of souls
does arise? for these commandments of Rulers, (kneel religiously before
bread, the vicegerent image of Christ crucified) (keep humane holy days)
Cross the air with your thumb above a baptized infants face) at best, are but
positive Commandments, not warranted by Gods word. But shall they be more
obligatorie by a supposed band of Justice that Prelates have over us to
command, such toy's then this divine law of God and Nature, Romans 14. For
indifferent days, meats, surplice, destroy not him for whom Christ died? All
the Casuistes, and Schoolmen, Navarra, Sylvester, Sanchez, Raphael de la
Torre, Meratius, Duvallius, Thomas, Scotus, Bonaventura, Suarez. Vasquez,
Grego. de Valentia, Albertus, Richardus, Biel, Corduba, Angelus, Adrianus,
Alphonsus, Becanus, yea, and all the host of our Divines cry with Scripture,
that Mercy and the precepts of Love, and of the Law of nature, are more
obligatorie then Sacrifice, burnt offerings, and Gods own positive laws, yea,
and that positive laws lose their obligatorie power, and cease to be laws,
when the laws of nature and necessary duties of mercy and love (as not to
murder our brother) (not to scandalize) stands in their way. I might weary
the reader here with citations, and bewilder my self also, but it is a point
of Divinity denied by none at all. 3. What we owe of Justice to our
Superiors, is indeed both a moral debt of obedience, and a debt of justice,
and law which Rulers may seek by their place, and ex jure, as Aristotle says,
but this right is limited, Rulers have no right to seek absolute obedience,
but only in the Lord, not against charity. And though the place of Rulers be
authoritative, yet their commanding power, as touching the matter of what they
injoyne is only Ministerial, and they cannot but in Gods place exact, that
which is Gods due, and seeing God himself, if he should immediately in his own
person command, he would not urge a positive commandment, far less the
commandment of light and vain Ceremonies, against and beyond the precept of
love, not to destroy a soul for whom Christ died. Ergo, Superiors under God,
who borrow all their right from God, cannot have a higher right then God has.
4. The comparison of a man who owes moneys to a Creditor, and owes moneys to
the poor, is close off the way, for he is obliged to pay the Creditour first,
but the case here is far otherwise; The debt of practicing indifferent
feathers and straws, such as kneeling, crossing, wearing Surplice, is neither
like the debt owine to the poor, nor to the creditour; For natures law, and
Gods word, 1 Cor. 10. 18, 19. makes the nonpractise, non-murthering obedience
to God, when the practice of indifferent things, is a soule-stumbling to the
weak, and the practicing is but at its best obedience to a positive Law, and
ought to stoop, and go off the way, and disappeare when natures Law (Murder
not) does come in its way. When the Doctors put Loyalty above Charity, they
suppose obedience to commandments commanding scandalizing of souls to be
loyalty to Superiors, which is questioned, it being treason to the Sovereign
of heaven and earth, to destroy his Image, it is taken as loyalty by our
Doctors, but not proven to be loyalty, and so a vain question here, whether
Loyalty be above Charity or not. But I dismiss the Doctors till another
occasion. Other things as Popish tenants, in their book are a thousand times
answered by us.

Quest. V.
Whether or not in every indifferent thing are we to eschew the scandal of
all, even of the malicious?

IT is known that many take offense at tolling of Bells, at a Ministers gown
while he preaches, at the naming of the days of the week, after the Heathen
style from the seven Planets, as Sunday, the day of the Sun; Moonday, the day
of the Moon, etc. It is true, Bells are abused by Papists, while as they be
consecrated, baptized, used to chase away devils. But these be scandals taken,
and not given, for we read not of scandals culpable in Gods word, but there be
some apparent moral reason in them. 2. The object scandalizing has no
necessity, why it should be. Now there is a necessitte of Bells to give
warning to convocate the people to Gods worship, and they are of mere civil
use, and have no moral influence in the worship, for the same tolling of bells
is, and may be used to convocate the people to a Ba^oncourt, to hear a
declamation, to convocate Soldiers; there is no apparent moral reason why the
tolling of a Bell should scandalize, and the toller of the Bell for warning of
the bodily and personal convocation of the people, is not a moral agent
properly; the action of tolling remains within the sphere of an acti^n
physical^* in linea Physica, non in linea morali aut religi^sa aut Theologi^a,
for so here I must contradistinguish a Physica^l action from a Religious
action. 2. The tolling of bells have a necessity of expediencie, I mean
necessity in specie, in the kind, though not in in lividuo, in the particular,
and no particular can be more fit and convenient: people must have some publ
que sign for the dyat of meeting* else the worship would be wearisome to those
who met long before the time, and it would be scandalous and inconvenient, to
others to meet after the public worship is begun. If any say, tolling of Bells
is not necessary, sounding of Trumpets, beating of Drums may be civil
signs of convocating people; touling of bells being so foully abused by Papists
to superstition, and so being not necessary ought to be removed. But I answer,
beating of Drums wants the necessity of conveniencie, as in raynie weather
it could not be, nor can they give warning so conveniently: blowing of Trumpets
might seem as Jewish, Joel cap. 2. v. 15. as tolling of Bells seems Popish,
and the degrees of necessity of conveniencie should sway the Chu^ches
determination in these cases, and this exsuperancie of necessity of
conveniencie is in all things, though we cannot see it always; 2. The
instamped civil gravitie in a Gown, makes it necessary with the necessity
of expediencie, being in it self a grave habit fit for an Orator who is to
persuade. 3. The names of days to signify civil times and things, out of a
religious state is necessary now: and the Holy Ghost does use for civil
signification such terms, as Mars-street to signify civil and merely
historically such a place. And the Ship whose sign is Castor and Pollux, yet
these were heathen names, and most superstitious, and cannot be used in a
religious state. I grant, we may not term our Jehovah, Jupiter or Baal; nor
Christ, Mercurius, though he be the word of Gods mind to us, for God teaches
us other words and language in his Word. The truth is, that Robert Lord brook,
in a discourse of nature of Episcopacie, cap. 5. page ^6.
learned noble Lord said well and judiciously, all the indifferency (in the
world) lies in our understandings, and the darkness thereof -- but there is
none in the things themselves, or actions, which are still either unlawful or
necessary. And this is most true in actions moral and humane. The Church
puts indifferency on nothing, there a necessity in respect of our
darkness, many be scandalized at things which seem not necessary to them,
yet are they in re, in themselves necessary. But conformists object, That the
very will of the Church, Act. 15. made things indifferent before the act now to
become necessary, if then the Church may take away indifferency, she may give
also. But I answer, The antecedent is most false, Junius, Calvin, Beza,
Bullinger, Brentius, Pomeranus, Marloret, and the text clearly says, by the
law of Nature these were scandalous. So Origin cont. Celsum, l. 8.
Origin thinks to eat bl^oa was scandalous. And Strabo, l. 15.
Strabo says, the heathen in their sacrifice drank blood; Yea, Tertull. in 2
pol. ca 9. bibebant sanguinem humanum.
says Tertullian, the heathen drank men's blood, and August. epist 19. Vt
vetus synagoge hoc pacto cum honor sepaliretur.
Augustine says, they forbade these for a time in the case of scandal* that
the ancient Synogogue might be buried with honor; Yea, Ireneus. lib. 2 cap 12.
Ireneus, Tertullian de pudicit, c. 12.
Tertullian, and Cyprian ad Quirinum, l 7.
Cyprian will have these drawn to a spiritual sense, that they should
abstain from Idolatry, shedding of blood and fornication; And Lorinus com. in
act 15. ait esse legem mere positivam, quae r^moto, contemptu scandalo and alio
peccato, non videtur arcte obligare.
the Jesuit Lorinus says this was a positive Law, which without the case of
scandal, does not strictly abolish. Cajetan, vitare fornicationem est divini
juri^, reliqua ^ Canone erant ut mor^m gererent ^^ Iudaeis quibus conviverent.
Cajetanus, Fornication by Gods law was forbidden, the other things in the
Canon were forbidden to gratify the Jews. Philip. Gameth. in. 12. q. 104. 105.
c^. 2 ad fovendum inter Iude^s and Gen^es mutu^m concordiam propter
infirmitatem Iudaeorum.
Philippus Gamethaeus a Sorbenist says, they were forbidden to nourish concord
betwixt Jew and Gentile, for the infirmity of the Jews. 2. That the will of
the Council made them not necessary, whereas before the act they were
indifferent, is clear. 1. It had then been needless to discuss the matter by
Scripture. 2. To allege the holy Ghost as author of the Synod; It seemed good
to the Holy Ghost, etc. if the bare will of men had made them necess^rie.

But says Paybodie, par. 3 page 413. 4^4.
Paybodie, Any good thing may become an occasion of evil by accident, and
through our fault, the Word condemns not occasions of ill by accident, but
such only as are occasions of evil, and in themselves evil things,
indifferent are not in themselves evil.

Ans. All occasions whether ill in themselves or indifferent, are occasions of
sin by accident, and through our fault who abuse them, but all occasions
because occasions, and not because evil are forbidden, when as they are not
necessary, and this is Gods argument to prove that the Jews are not to marry
with the Canaanites for (says the law) they will turn away your heart, after
their Gods, to send abroad a goaring ox, to seek his food, has no sin in
it, save only it may occasion the killing of men; and the building of houses
without battlements, and the going by the door of the whore, or coming near
her house, are not of themselves ill, but only forbidden under this
reduplication, because they are occasions of ill: sins, as sins are
forbidden, and as occasions of sins, they are also new sins, having a
distinct illegalitie and guiltiness in them, from this that they occasion
sin: and Gods law (as all Divines reach) forbids sin, and all occasions
of sin. Drunkenness is both forbidden as intemperancie, and also as an
occasion of lust, and of speaking perverse things, as is evident, Pro. 23. 33.
For then the spirit of Gods argument were null to dissuade from drunkenness,
as he does in these wo^ds, Thine eye shall behold strange women, and thine
heart shall utter perverse things. Now we can show that many ways Ceremonies
occasion sin, as 1. they trim and decore a Church for harlot lovers, from
Rome, forbidden, Jer. 2. 33. Suarez, Franciscus de sancta clara, Gretserus, and
other Papists, for these, werein love with the Church of England. 2. They
occasion dissension in Gods house, and are contrary to peace, Ps. 34. 14. Heb.
12. 19. Romans 12. 18. and so to be rejected. 3. They bear false witness of
Popery, which we disclaim. 4. They are against the spiritual worshipping of
God, and lead us back to the carnal commandments, and beggarly rudiments of
the law, from the Gospel, against the word of God, Joh 4. 24. Gal. 4 9, 10.
Heb. 7. 16. Heb. 9. 8. 9. Gal. 3. 25. 26. Gal. 4. 1. 2. Coll. 2. 20. They are
torches in day light, and vain and useless. 5. They bring us under bondage to
men, contrary to the Apostle, Col. 2. 20. and to the ordinances of men, and
under the power of things, 1 Cor. 6. 12. 6. They are against our Christian
liberty. They answer, especially Paybodie.
Paybodie, and D. Forbes in Irenic^.
D. Forbes, that Christian liberty is not restrained by doing, or not doing a
thing indifferent, for so there should be no laws made at all by the Church,
concerning things indifferent, but Christian liberty not hurt, if 1. the
Ceremonies be free to the conscience, and not made necessary. 2. If they be
not made necessary to salvation. 3. If they be holden alterable by man's
authority. Ans. The question is perverted* for we question not if the use of
things indifferent lay a bond on Christian liberty, but if the will of
authority can make a law of things indifferent; when there is no intrinsecall
necessity in the things themselves, when necessity of edification lays on a
tie, Christian liberty is not indeed restrained, for God then lays on a
bond. 2. External eating of meats, and observing of days, is a part of the
liberty, wherewith Christ has made us free, Coll. 2. 21. Eat not, touch not,
taste not, men eat not meat with their mind or conscience, but with the teeth
of their body, and to such external eating, men are dead with Christ, as
touching external observation thereof, and Paul, Gal. 2. 19. as dead to the
Law, living to God, and crucified with Christ, is freed from such Judaizing, as
Peter fell into, but that Judaizing did not bind Peter's conscience, neither was
it repute of him, as necessary to salvation, as he had taught, Act. 10. And
the false Apostles pressed Circumcision, not, as tying the conscience, or as
necessary for salvation, but Gal. 6. 12. (...), etc. only, that they may not
suffer affliction for the cross of Christ, and yet to be circumcised
externally without necessity of conscience before God, crossed directly the
liberty wherewith Christ had made them free, Gal. 5. 1. and 1 Cor. 9. Have we
not power to lead about a wife, and sister as well as others? Yet if the
Prelates at Corinth should have made an act, forbidding Churchmen to marry,
though they had esteemed not marrying, both free to the conscience, and also
not necessary to salvation, they had laid bands upon Paul's liberty. 3. We see
not how the Ceremonies are left free to the conscience, because they are
alterable by the Church, for the reason of kneeling to bread, of humane days,
of Surplice, is moral, not National; there is no reason why profaning of the
Lords Supper, should not be eschewed, in all the world, and at all times, as in
Britain, and at this time; and Crossing and Surplice does signify dedication
to Christ's service, and Pastoral holiness in all the world, as in Britain,
and therefore they cannot be national rites and alterable, but must be
universal, and at all times, and in all places doctrinall. 4. The very
external Washings, Feasts, New-Moones, Offerings, though they should be
thought free toward the conscience, are external burdens against Christian
liberty, as our Divines, Calvin Inst^t. l 3. c. 19. sect. 7. t^rtia (pars
libertatis) ut nu^la rerum ext^^n^r^m quae per s^siunt, (...), ^^lig^^ne* cor^m
D^o tang^remur quin eas nunc usurpare, nunc ind^ff^renter liceal uti.

Chemnitius, Polan. Syntag Th^ol. lib 6. ca. 9.
Polanus teaches, and B^ll, de ^fficac Sacram, 1. 2 ca. 32
Bellarmine answers, the places alleged speaks of Jewish servitude. But
our Divines especially Iu^ius in B^ll co. 3. l 4. ^a 17. ^. 19 20
Junius and Whitt^ker de pontif. R^m. q. 7. c. 3. ad 5.
Whittakerus answer Bellarmine, that Paul, Coll. 2. speaks against all
Commandments of men, yea, he speaks against Angel* worship, which is not a
Jewish shadow, whereof Christ is the body. But they say it is a wide rule,
that all things that may be wanting in Gods worship, are to be omitted in the
case of scandal. I answer, there be three sort of things here considerable. 1.
Things not commanded of God, as all religious observances, these are utterly
unlawful, when the using of them scandalizeth. 2. Things that fall under an
affirmative precept, and these cannot be totally omitted, for eschewing
scandal: for what ever God has commanded is some way necessary. Ergo, it
some ways, and in some cases, may be done, though offense be taken at it, but
branches, or parts of affirmative precepts may be omitted, for eschewing of
scandal, as such a particular kneeling in prayer, in such a place: but Gods
affirmative precepts leave not off to be always scandalous actively though
information be given, for where the use hurts, the abuse and scandal is not
taken away by teaching, to teach how Images should not be abused, make not
Images to leave off to be scandalous objects. 3. There be some things of mere
civil use, as Bells, Gowns, Pulpits, preaching on Tuesday or Thursday. These
be considered two ways. 1 As necessary with necessity of conveniencie
simply. 2. With necessity of conveniencie. secundum prevalentiam graduum, as
convenient in the highest degree of necessity, or that moral, maximum quod
sit, in the first degree, what scandalizeth* is to be rejected; in the last
respect they oblige, and if any be scandalized thereat, it is taken and not
given. It may be the Church sees not always the highest and superlative
conveniencie, in these Physical circumstances, but they oblige not because of
the Churches authority, no more then the word of God borrows authority from
the Church, but they have an intrinsecall necessity in themselves, though
right reason in the Church see not always this necessity, therefore that a
sign be given for convening the people that the Preacher officiate in the most
grave and convenient habit is necessary, Jure divino, by Gods law, and that
tolling of Bells, and a Gown, a Pulpit be as particulars most convenient for
these ends, the Church Ministerially does judge, so as the obligatorie power is
from the things themselves, not from the will of humane Superiors. No
necessity of peace which is posterior to truth, no necessity of obedience to
authority, no necessity of uniformitie in these externals, simply, and as
they are such, are necessities obliging us to obedience: for things must first
in themselves be necessary, before they can oblige to obedience. I must obey
Superiors in these things of convenient necessity, because they are
convenient, and most convenient in themselves, and so intrinsecally most
necessary, but they are not necessarily to be done in themselves, because I
must obey Superiors, and because I must keep uniformitie with the Church. The
will of Superiors do find in things necessity, and good of uniformitie, but
they do not make necessity, nor the good of uniformitie: We should be
servants of men, if our obedience were ultimate resolved, in the mere will of
Superiors, in any the least circumstance of worship: and what I say of
actions, holds in matters of mere custom also.

But Master Sanderson, D. Forbes, M. Paybodie, teach that we are not to regard
the scandal of the malicious, as of Pharisees. To which I answer, We are to
have alike regard, in case of scandal, to wicked and malicious, as to weak
and infirm. For we are not to regard the passive scandal of the weak more
nor of the wicked, for who ever stumble at the necessary ordinances of God,
they take a scandal, which is not culpably given. But that we are to regard
the active scandal of all, even the most malicious, I demonstrate thus, 1 Romans
14. 15. Paul proves that we are not to scandalize our brother, 1. because it
is against charity. 2. Because we are not to destroy him, for whom Christ
died: but we owe love to the malicious, even to our enemies, and must not walk
uncharitably toward him, as the law of God requires. 3. A malicious man is one
for whom Christ died, very often, as is clear in Paul before his conversion.

2. 1 Cor. 10. 32. Wherefore give no scandal, neither to the Jews, nor to the
Gentiles, nor to the Church of God. 33. Even as I please all men in all things,
not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.
Here be many arguments for our purpose, All men; whether weak or wilful, are
either Jews or Gentiles, and none more malicious against Paul, and the
Gospel, then the Jews, yet must we take heed that we give them no scandal.

3. If we must please all men, in all things indifferent, Ergo, Fran. Silvius
Duacens Profes. in 22. q. 43. ^^. 7. concl 3. Charitas dicat ne absque omni
causa ^ff^ramus proximo, eti^m ex* malitia peccaturo, occasionem peccati. Ita
Tannerus, in 22. to. 3. ais. 1. q 6 duc. 9. asse^. 3 bon^ conqued^m ^^bia
^lavandis ad vitandum scandalum malitiosorum.
also malicious men. 4. If we must seek the profit not of our selves, but of
all men, and seek to save them, and so seek the salvation even of the
malicious, as Christ prayed for his malicious enemies, so must we not
scandalize them. 5. I argue from the nature of scandal, scandal is spiritual
murder, but the sixth Commandment for bids murdering of any man, either
weak or wilful, for no murderer can have life eternal, 1 John 3. 15. Now
weakness or malice in the scandalized is accidental to the nature of scandal
active, for active scandalizing is to do inordinately and unseasonably, that
which hic and nunc may be omitted, from which any is scandalized, either weak
or wilful, to lay a snare to kill a wicked man (except it be, by the
authority of him, who bears the sword under God) is murder, no less then
to kill an innocent man. 6. To scandalize actively, is to be accessarie to the
sin of the party scandalized, but we may not be accessarie to the sin of
either wilful, wicked, or weak, for it is against the petitions, that we are
taught to pray, Hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, in
earth, as it is in heaven. They love not the coming and enlargement of Christ's
kingdom, who do not, what they can to hinder sin, far less is Gods
honor their care, who do that unnecessarily, by which any may fall in sin. 7.
It is against the gentleness required in Preachers, and by proportion required
in all, who are with patience to wait upon these who oppose the truth, if God
peradventure will give them repentance, to the acknowledgement of the truth. 2 Timothy 2. 24. 25. 8. It is contrary to the example of Christ, and his Apostles,
who as the learned Parker on the cross, part 2. sect 8. Math. 17. 2^.
Parker says, eschewed the active scandalizing of the malicious, Christ paid
tribute, (...), lest we should scandalize the malicious Pharisees, for it could
not but of malice be taken by Pharisees, who sought nothing more then to bring
Christ within the compass of disl^yaltie to Caesar.

Quest. VI.
A further consideration of things not necessary, and how they be scandalous
objects.

1. Did.
SOme things are necessary physically, as to eat flesh, Of the necessity of
things which remove scandal.
and some things are necessary morally, either because of a law of nature, or
a positive or divine command.

2. Did.
The same way, Some things are not necessary physically, and that either
simply, as we may live simply without some rare meats, that our Land and soil
does not afford, or in some respect only, as without such and such flesh
forbidden by the law of God. Or things are not necessary Morally or
Theologically, as to eat forbidden-meats before a weak Jew.

3. Did.
Some things Physically necessary, as to eat fleshes being apt to nourish my
body, may be Morally or Theologically not necessary, being stambling blocks to
my weak brother.

4. Did.
Some things may be necessary, in specie, and that morally, as to hear the
Word, to Pray. But, in individuo, clothed with such and such circumstances may
be not necessary, as to go to hear the Word, when my brothers house is on
fire, that hearing is not necessary, but may be scandalous, and the like we
may say of praying in the streets.

5. Did.
Some things may be necessary Physically in private* as to eat for health some
fleshes, which publicly before weak Jews, as the case was Romans 14. is Morally
not necessary, but scandalous.

6. Distinct.
Some things are not necessary, because of the mere positive will of God. As
the temple of Baal, and therefore was to be ^estroyed, Some things necessary
from the only positive will of God, Some things necessary from some thing in
the things themselves.
not for the abuse of it for a house has always some necessary use to man now
in the state of sin. And of this kind were the cattle of the Amalakites, which
were as necessary of themselves for food, and sacrifice, as other cattle* and
the Babylonish garment, and wedge of Gold, to which Achan's slimie hands did
cleave, and therefore ehey were not necessary, but to be abstained from by
Saul and the Israelites. because of the sole positive command of God, Other
things are not necessary, both because God forbids them and because of the
scandal and sinful consequences, that are possible to fall out, as for Gods
people to marry with ^he idola^rou^ Canaanites, was not necessary* both
because Gods forbidden will made it not necessary morally, and also because
they might draw away Gods people to serve their Gods, which was a fea^able, and
a very possible snare, thought some idolatresses being married to the Jews,
might have been drawn from their idolatry, and gained to the faith of the God
of Israel.

1. Concl. Monuments, or instruments of idolatry, are of two sorts, either
such things as have no other use at all, but to contribute Two sorts of
monuments of idolatry.
sorne subservient influence in, or unto idolatrous worship, and because these
have all their warrant from a mere commandment of man, they are simply not
necessary, as the graven image, the idols themselves, all positive observances
in Gods worship destitute of any command of God, and the use of these in any
case must be scandalous, and so unlawful, because, if the Brazen Serpent now
losing its primitive divine effect, which was to cure the stinged people, if it
be but the passive object of robbing God of his glory, in that Incense is
burnt to it, have no use at all* but to be, as it were, a robbers Den to
receive the stolne-away glory of God, it must be abolished. It is true things
necessary abused in regard of our corruption, are to be purged, and restored to
their own use, but if they be useless, and of themselves have no fruit, but
only, that they are fit to be abused, as useless pittes by the way side, and
the Brazen Serpent, and a Razor put in the hand of a child, and images, they
are to be removed, both subject and accident, for that they be incapable of
purgation, therefore they are capable only of abolition. It is not enough to
say that we may We cannot devise the use of any thing in worship, when we
cannot devise the thing it self.
devise a good use for them, as we may use Images to put us in remembrance of
God, for we may never devise the use of a thing not necessary in Religion,
when as we cannot devise the thing it self. But here we cannot devise the
thing it self. Yea, if the thing it self be good, and lawfully useful. As
the eating of flesh, yet if it be less necessary, for the life, then the
edification of my brother. The Apostles excellent rule, Romans 14. v. 15. must
stand as a law discharging my eating* No man for this or this m^at, which is
less necessary, ought to hinder the salvation of his brother, which is more
necessary, by destroying his brother for meat. For clear it is, this or that
meat, without which I may live, is of fa^re less necessity comparatively,
then the salvation of one for whom Christ died. True it is also, if my brother
be scandalized, and so his soul in hazard, if I eat any at all, in that case,
the scandal is merely passive, for though my brothers salvation be of greater
consequent and necessity then my temporal life, yet my total abstinence from
meat is a killing of my self and heinous murder, and so forbidden in the sixth
Commandment, and so a destroying of my own soul. And eating for conscience
sake is necessary, though eating of this or this meat be not necessary.

But there be other things that are instruments of idolatry and subservient
thereunto, in a Common and Physical influence, as a Temple builded to the
honor of a Saint, and for the adoring of Images, and for the reading and
opening the word of God in the New and old Testament, though in a corrupt way,
these are not properly monuments of Idolatry. Now the house or Church, as such
is no monument, nor useless instrument in worship, such as is a Surplice, a
humane holy day, for it has, as such, being a thing of walls and timber, no
other, then that very same physical influence in worshipping either the true
God, or a Saint, that it has in civil use, in our ordinary dwelling, to wit,
to fence our bodies, in religious, in natural, in civil actions, from
injuries of heaven, clouds, and sin. The adjuncts of the Church, as Crucifixes,
Images, Altars, Ravels, Masse-clothes, and the like, are properly Monuments,
and instruments of Idolatry, because these are not necessary, as is the
material house, nor have they any common and physical influence in the
worship, as the Temple has, yea all the necessity or influence that they have
in the worship, is only religious and humane flowing from the will of men,
without either necessity from our natural Constitution of body, or any word
of Scripture, and therefore they are to be removed upon this ground, because
they are unnecessarie snares to Idolatry.

Object. This particular Temple or house builded for Saint Peter, S. Paul, S.
Cutbert is not necessary for the worship of God, because other houses of as
convenient use, and necessity may be had, for the worship of God, and this
particular house ought to be demolished as Jehu 2 King. 10. 27. destroyed the
house of Baal, and made it a draught-house, as the law says expressly, Deuteronomy. 7.
25. The place Deuteronomy. 7. 25. The graven image of their God shall ye burn with
fire dicleared.
The graven Images of their Gods, shall ye burn with fire, thou shall not
desire the silver or gold that (is on) them* nor take it unto thee, lest thou
be snared therein: for it is an abomination unto the Lord thy God. v. 26.
Neither shall thou bring an abomination unto thy house, lest thou be a cursed
thing like it, but thou shall utterly detest it, and thou shall utterly abhor
it, for it is a cursed thing. Or at least these Churches may be employed for
some other use, then for the worship of God, where they may be snares.

Ans 1. We are carefully to distinguish between a law of Nature, or a
perpetual binding Moral law, which stands for an eternal rule to us,
except the Lawgiver himself by a superven^ent positive law, which serves but
for a time, do loose us from an obligation thereunto, and a positive
temporary law. God says in an exoresse law, of nature* that obliges us
perpetually (The sun shall not be put to death for the sins of the father) no
Magistrate on earth can lawfully take away the life of the son, for the sin of
the father, for this eternally obliges. Yet Saul was to destroy the sucking
children of the Amalekites for the sins of their fathers, but he had a
positive temporary command of God to warrant his fact, 1 Samuel 15. 2. 3. none
can infer that we are from this law, which was a particular exception, from a
Catholic perpetually obliging moral law, that Magistrates are now to take
away the lives of the sucking infants of Papists. So this is perpetual and
moral, and warranteth us for ever to use all the creatures of God for our use.
1. Tim. 4. 4. Genesis 1. 27. 28. then we may lawfully use Gold, Silver, Houses,
all creatures for meats, except some particular positive law, or some
providentiall emergent necessity How houses and Temples builded to Saints are
no^ to be demolished.
forbid us, as the Ceremonial laws of the Jews forbidding the eating of
swines flesh, and some other meats, were no other thing, but Divine positive
exceptions from the law of nature and creation, in the which God had created
swines flesh, and all these other forbidden meats for the use of Man, and so by
the same reason, God has ordained Church and houses to fence off us the
injuries of Sun and Air, in all our actions civil and religious, except
that by a peculiar Precept, he forbid the use of the house of Baal, to the
Jews, to be a typical teaching to us of Gods hating of Idols and Idolatry,
but not of our demolishing and making useless all houses builded to the honor
of Idols and Saints under the New Testament, except we had the like
Commandment that the Jews had.

These who oppose us, in this, can no more inhibite us by any law of God, of
the ^se of a creature granted to us by the law of the creation, then they can
interdyte us of the use of another creature, nor are we more warranted to
demolish Temples and material houses which have only a physical and common
use alike in all our actions, Natural, civil, and Ecclesiastical or
Religious, then of eating swines flesh, or of other meats forbidden in the
Cerem^nial Law, and to answer to the Argument, this or that material house
builded to the honor of Paul and Peter is every way as necessary in the
worship of God* as a Temple builded of purpose for the worship of God, though
another house may conduce as much for the worshipping of Temples and houses
have a like physical use in Gods worship, as out of Gods worship.
God* as this, yea it has the same very necessary Use, and Physical
conveniencie, for the serving of God, that any other house has, which was
never builded for the honor of a Saint, which I prove, 1. because no creature
of God* that is useful to us, by the law of creation, is capable of any moral
contagion to make^ it unlawful to us, but from the mee^ will of God as the
Gold and Silver, and Idol houses of the false Gods, and Images of Canaan are
in^^^secally, and by the Law of creation, as pure, and morally clean, as the
Gold and Silver and Synagogues of the Jews, and had their Physical and civil
necessity, the one, as the other had. But from whence was it that the Jews
might make use of their own Silver and Gold, and houses, and not of the
houses, or silver and gold of the heathen Gods and Idols? Certainly this was
from Gods mere positive will and command, fobidding the Gold and houses of the
Idols of Cannan, and not forbidding the other, the Adversaries can give no
other reason: therefore they must give us the same positive Commandment, for
not making use of the Gold and Silver, and Temples of the Popish Idols, and
Saints under the New Testament, that the Jews had for refusing the Gold and
Silver, and demolishing the Temples of the heathenish Idols of Canaan. And if
they say, Th^^ the very command that warranted the Jews to abstain, from the
Deuteronomy. 7. 25, 26.
use of the heathe^s Gold and Idol-temples, does warrant us to abstain^ from
the use of the Gold and Idol-temples of Papists. It is answered, we have no
warrant from the Word, but it shall warrant us as well to abstain from swines
flesh; if it be replied, every creature of God eatable i^ Good, and may be
received lawfully* 1 Timothy* 4 6 Rom 14* 14* I answer, so all gold, all silver all
houses serving to ^^nc^ off the injuries of heaven, and air, are good, and fit
for Man's use, and now blessed in Christ under the New Testament, except you
say, that it is not lawful to make use of the Gold and Silver of a Papis^^
Image, no^ of crees of the Papists fields that b^aret^ ^^ fruit, for these also
were discharged to the Jews, Deuteronomy 20. v. 19* 20* and the reason why they ^ight
not cut down the t^^^^* th^^ be^^^^ fruit, because these trees were man's life,
Deuter. 20 19 whereas t^^^^ that bear no fruit were to be cut down, as not so
necessary for man's life. Now this reason is moral and perpetual, and so are
houses to sense off the injuries of the clouds a Manslife; except they be
forbidden by a positive law of God, and so necessary as without the ^se of
houses no worshipping of God can be ordinarily; And therefore in the second
place, as we use Gold Silver, Tamples* and material houses (though abused to
Idolatry) because the Lord has created them for our use, his law of Creation
warranting us to use them, so can we not refrain from No Houses, no Temple, no
creatures, are now unclean ^^er the New Testament.
the use of them, though abused by Papists, except we have a special positive
law to warrant us to refrain from the use of these necessary creatures of
God, so useful for the life of man; For according to the grounds of these
against whom we now dispute, the Garments of silk or cloth of Gold, that has
covered Popish Images, the Gold and Silver of the Popish Images, though melted
and dissolved into innocent metal, the Material Temples builded to the
honor of Saints, are to be cast away and utterly abolished, as unlawful to be
used in any sort, for the Deuteronomy. 12. 1, 2.
Jews according to the Law, Deuteronomy. 7. 19. 20. might make no use of the gold or
silver of the Heathen-Image, and Achan brought a curse on himself, for the
simple taking for his use, the wedge of Gold, and the Babilon^sh Garment. Now
we have no law in the New Testament to abandon the use of the creatures, for as
Cornelius was not to count that meat unclean, which God ^ad cl^nsed, Act. 10.
15. So neither are we to count Silver and Gold, and houses useless, which God
in the Creation made Good, and useful for our life, and therefore no moral
contagion can adhere so to these creatures, as we are utterly to disuse them,
as creatures cursed, because they were abused, except it can be proved that the
abuse of them has deprived us of the necessary use, that they have by the law
of Creation; for certain it is, as the killing of the sucking infants of the
Amalakites was typical, and tyeth not us to kill the young children of Papists
so was the disusing, or not using of Gold, Silver and Houses, abused to
Idolatry, typical.

And before I come to the second Conclusion, An house for the worship of God is
amongst the things that are necessary, by way of dis-junction in specie, not
in individuo; that is, a house is necessary, in its Physical use, to fence
off our bodies, the injuries of Sun, Air, and heaven, but not this house,
for another How things not necessary are to be abstained from, or used, in
the ^ase of Scandal.
house may serve the turn as conveniently. But some object Then this, or this
house Dedicated superstitiously to the religious honor of a Saint ought to be
removed out of the worship of God, 1 because by your own confession. Th^^
individual house so abused is not necessary. God may will be worshipped,
without this house, though it never had been, in rerum natura. 2. From the
worshipping of God in so Superstitious a place, many truly godly are so
scandalized, that for worshipping God in such Superstitious and Idolatrous
places, they have Separated from your Church, conceiving that in so doing you
heal the wounds of the Beast; It is true, it may be their weakness, yea but
be it so, that it were their wickedness, that they are scandalized, yet by your
doctrine, in things not necessary you are not to do any thing by which either
the weak, or the wicked may be scandalized; as is clear in the eating of
meats, Romans 14.

Ans. This argument may 1. be retorted against these who hold with us the same
doctrine of Scandal, for, without eating of Swines flesh, my life may be
preserved, and a malicious Jew may be, and necessarily is highly scandalized,
that I, who possibly am a Jew converted to the Christian faith, do eat Swines
flesh before him, for he conceives me to be an Apostate from Moses his law,
therefore I should abstain from eating Swines flesh before a Jew, who out of
Malice is scandalized, by my doing a thing not necessary, hic and nunc. But
the conclusion is absurd: nor do I think that many truly godly of the
Strictest Separation do stumble at our Churches out of wickedness. Many truly
Godly and Sincere refuse to come to our Churches, whereas many scandalous, well
lustered hypocrites, who knows nothing of the power of godliness, but are
sitten down in the Scorners Chair are admitted to the Lords Supper, and as
the former cannot be excused, so I pray God, that the latter draw not down the
wrath of God upon both Kingdoms. 2. Things not necessary which actively
produce scandal must not be only indifferent Physically in their natural use,
as This or this house, but they must be indifferent both Physically and
Morally, for the Meats spoken of, Romans 14. at that time, were both ways
indifferent. 1. They were not necessary but indifferent Physically in an
ordinary providence, both then and now, for ordinarily my life may be
preserved, and suffer little loss by not eating Swines flesh, or such meats,
in case of extreme necessity of sterving, if any could have no other meat,
they might eat then, as the case was, Romans 14. because Mercy is better then
Sacri^^^ at alltimes. 2. These things Romans 14. were indifferent Theologically
or Morally in their own nature, 1. v. 3. Let not him that eats, despise him
that eats not: and let not him which eats not, judge him that eats, for
God has received him. 2. Because v. 17. The kingdom of God is not meat and
drink. Sure, in Moses his time, to abstain from such meats, and eat such, as
the Lamb of the Passover, the Manna, to drink of the water of the Rock, was
worship, and so some part of the kingdom of heaven, but it is not so now,
says Paul. 3 Paul clearly makes them Morally indifferent. 1 Cor. 8. 8 But
meat commends us not to God, for neither if we eat, are we better (morally
and before God) neither if we eat not, a e we (Morally) theworse. Now this
Temple or House Physically is indifferent, and not necessary for the worship
of God, for men may be defended from the injuries of Sun and air, Though
this house had never been in rerum natura. But this Temple or house though
dedicated to a Saint is not Morally indifferent, but Morally necessary, so as
if you remove it from the worship, because abused to Idolatry, and give it in
no use in the defending of our bodies from the injuries of the Wind, Rain and
Sun, you Iudaize, and do actively scandalize the Jews, and harden them in
their Apostasy, and so this house though abused to Idolatry, is not
indifferent Morally, as the meats Romans 14. But the using of it is necessary
and an asserting of our Christian liberty, as to eat blood, and things
strangled, and Swines flesh even before a Jew, so to use all houses for a
physical end to defend our bodies from heat and cold, is a part of the
liberty wherewith Christ has made us free. But Ceremonies have no natural
and physical use. The crossing of the air with the Thumb, the keeping of a
day religiously without warrant of the Word, are not taught in the School of
Nature, and so are naturally not necessary as This or this house, though
abused to Superstition is, and the Adversaries that say they are Morally
indifferent, as good, and as Spiritual Ceremonies in kind and nature, may be
devised in their place. But in all this dispute of Scandal, we give, but do
never grant that the Ceremonies are indifferent, we dispute here that they are
scandalous, and so unlawful in their use, upon the principles of Formalists;
whereas we judge them in their nature, because they have not God, but the will
of men to be their father and author, to be unlawful, and repugnant to
Scripture, because not warranted by either command, practice, or promise in
Scripture.

Conclus. 2. As some things Physically necessary must be abstained 2. Conclus.
from, when the unseasonable using of them is a stumbling block to our weak
brother, in the case of the moral indifferency of the thing, as it was in the
eating, or not eating of meats once forbidden by Gods law, but then
indifferent. Romans 14. 14. 1 Cor. 8. 8. for then it was true, ( But meat
commends us not to God* for neither if we eat are we the better, neither if
we eat not, are we the worse*) So in the case of physical indifferency, but
of Moral and Theological necessity, when an Evangelike law of Christian
liberty has passed a determination upon eating, or not eating; Then to
abstain from eating upon a pretended fear of not offending a weak Jew, is
actively to ^ay a sinful stumbling block before a weak Jew, and to harden him
in Iudaisme, and here using of such meats, and the affirmative, to wit, to eat
is lawful and necessary, the things being now morally necessary, not morally
indifferent, where as before* the negative, to wit, not to eat was lawful and
necessary. Hence to eat* Rom 14. 1 Cor. 8. before a weak Jew, was unlawful
and an active scandal, the eating or not eating then of the own nature being
morally indifferent, and to abstain from eating before a weak Jew, Col. 2. 16.
17. Gal. 2. v. 5. 11. 12. Gal. 5. 1. 2. 3. is unlawful and an active scandal,
because now eating is morally necessary, and a standing in, and an asserting
of the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free. And upon the same ground,
for the Jews, when the Ceremonial law stood in vigor, to make use of Baals
Temple, for a Synagogue to the worship of the true God, was unlawful and
against a Ceremonial Command of God, as was the sacrificing of the Amalakites
cattle to the Lord, and the using of the Silver and Gold of the Ca^^^^ites
Idols, Deuteronomy. 7. 25, 26. ^6. 1 Samuel 15. 1, 2, 3* But when these things forbidden
were in the case of moral indifferenc^^, as were certain meats, Romans 14. 1
Cor. 8. and c. 10. they were not unlawful* by reason of any* such Ceremonial
positive Commandment* only by the unseasonable using of them* before weak
Jews, they were scandalous; But these same Idols houses, Silver and Gold now,
when we are f^lly possessed in that liberty* wherewith Christ has made us
free, Are so to be used as the good creatures of God given to both Jew and
Gentile now under the Gospel, by the ancient Law of creation, that now to
abstain from the use of houses, Gold and Silver abused to idolatry and
worshipping of either Popish Saints or Idols, and the Idols of Pagans, upon any
pretense of a Ceremonial Command, were to Iudaize, and to betray our Christian
liberty, and the highest scandalizing and hardening of the Jews. For that is
a mere Ceremonial Commandment which depriveth us of the use of things or
creatures, that are naturally useful to us, such as are houses, cattle,
silver, and Gold, upon the mere will of the supreme law-give^; And upon this
ground to disuse Churches builded to Saints by Papists, is Iudaizing, for the
thing is not morally indifferent, as meats were in the case Romans 14. 1 Cor. c.
8. c. 10. but the use is morally necessary for the asserting of Christian
liberty; Christ having made every creature of God good in its native use, for
man, both Houses, and Gold and Silver, as all meats are 1 Timothy 4. 4. 5. Genes.
1. 28. 29. and having made all things new, Revel. 21. 5. and given us a new
spiritual right to them, 1 Cor. 3. v. 21. 22. 23. and therefore to take them
from us, by any Ceremonial law, is to put us again under the old yoke, from
which we are freed through Jesus Christ, Acts 15. v. 10. 11. And the houses,
and Gold and Silver, though abused to Idolatry, do now return to their
physical uses* of which the Jews, by a temporary positive law, were
interdyted, for the time of their in^an^i^, yea* if we were interdyted of any
creature of God, by such a law we might not eat of oxen and sheep, that had
belonged to Papists, who are Idolaters, for Saul was never to use the Cattle
of the Amalakites for common use, nor for food, nor for sacrifices to the Lord:
And it should be unlawful to melt the Silver-Images of Papists, and convert
them into money* for the poor, or cups them into silver bowls or cups, for the
lawful use of the Lords Supper. I grant to sell Images of Gold or Silver to
these who use them, as formal Idols is unlawful; as to sell a whore for money
to these that should prosesse the buying of her for (...)lo^^i^, were to be
accessarie to that harlotrie, especially seeing Idols formally remaining so
are, ex naturare^, for no other end but for Idolatris; they have no necessary
physical use for the life of man, sarre more, if they be the portraictures of
the Father, Son, or holy Spirit* if they be of stone, or of any thing, that
cannot be useful for man's life, then must they be defaced and broken, le^^ we
lay the stumbling block of our iniquity before others. Now, if from any law of
the Jews, or practice of Moses, and Ezechiah, houses builded to the honor of
Saints, Silver and Gold of Idols, were to be made useless, in their physical
use, in the worship of God, or for our civil use, then were we, upon that
ground, to dissolve the stones and timber of such a house, and to bray and
stamp the Silver and Gold into powder, as these holy Rulers did. People here
fleeing from Antichrist fall evidently in Iu^ais^e, and make themselves, with
the Galath^ans, debtors to Circumcision, and all the Ceremonies of Moses, which
thing we condemn in the Antichrist.

Object. If we must abstain from the use of no creature granted to us, by the
law of creation, except we have the warrant of a positive Ceremonial law for
it, then the Romans were not to for, bear eating of such and such meats,
before a weak Jew, for fear to scandalize him for whom Christ died, But this
later is untrue: for by the law of nature, and a perpetual law, Paul would
never, for meat, offend his brother: the law of natural Charity will dictate
this to us, without any positive mandate, we are not for a m^^thfull of meat*
the loss whereof is so small, to put the soul of our brother to so
incomparable a hazard, as to be losed.

Ans. These meats* Romans 14. and 1 Cor. 8. 10. were then indifferent, but they
are not so now, when the Gospel is fully promulgate, for we may not now to
abstain from Meats forbidden in the Ceremonial law, for fear to offend a
weak Jew, for our abstinence should harden them in their ^^beliefe, that
Christ is not yet come in the flesh. To make Temples and houses dedicated to
Saint^, as indifferent now as meats were then* and the argument were
concludent* But to demolish Churches and remove their physical use now were as
Judicial, as to forbear to eat Swines flesh. We are not to deprive our selves
of the physical use of (...) of this* or this meat as thinking we are bound by
any law of God to forbear the use thereof, and especially we are not to do
it, as conceiving we are under the tie of a law given to the Jews, whereas we
are under no such tie, or law, at all. But the disusing of Temples dedicated to
Saints, that the Adversaries plead for, Deuteronomy. 7. is a total renouncing of all
use of them, and the places they allege from the Ceremonial law does conclude
it: for the Temples, silver and gold of the Idols of Can^an were altogether
useless to Israel. It was Achan's sin, that he took the Babilonish garment,
and the wedge of Gold; for any use civil or religious, though he should have
bestowed these for any religious use, or the relief of the poor and indigent:
yea, though it was scandalous to none, he having taken these privately and by
theft, yet the very taking of them was a curse to him, and the whole Camp of
Israel, for the total abandoning of all use whatsoever of these houses, Gold
and Silver, which in themselves, and by the law of Creation were physical, and
in regard of that natural use they had from their Creator to supply our
necessity, can have its rise from no other total and complete cause, but from
the sole positive Things scandalous under the N* Testament are forbidden in a
far: other sense, then m^a^, days and other things in the Ceremonial law.
will of God, discharging his people of the whole use of these creatures at
all, as if they had never been created for the use of man, whether their use
should be scandalous to others, or not scandalous. But by the law of nature,
which, I grant, says ( Thou shall not scandalize nor murder the soul of him,
for whom Christ has died.) The Romans, Romans 14. and the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 8
were forbidden the eating of fleshes forbidden in Moses law* But with these two
restrictions 1. they were forbidden not all eating of these meats in private,
but only in the presence of a weak Jew, and for the conscience of others, in
the case of scandal, 1 Cor 10 28, 29. (2) They were not by the law of nature
that inhibites scandal, forbidden the total use of these meats, in any case,
so as they should make these meats utterly useless to themselves, or to any
others. As the Jews were forbidden to make use of the Canaanitish Idols, Gold
and money: And of the Cattle of the Amalekites, either secretly or openly,
either in the case of scandal given to others, or not given. And Achan paid
dear for his Babilonish garment, and his wedge of Gold, though he took it by
theft.

Ob. 2. But the reason of the law, is the soul of the law. Now the reason of
the Law, Deuteronomy. 7. 25. why God forbade his people to take the Gold or Silver of
the graven image, is l^st thou be ensnared therein. But this reason holds
under the Now Testament, and is moral and perpetual. The very mat^riall house
dedicated to Saints and Idol^, by Papists, is a snare to our souls; if we
shall worship God in them, or if we shall name the Church from Cutbert, Giles,
or the like, except we would say, as Papists do, that we are not now, under
the New Testament, so much ^^clined to Idolatry, as the people of the Jews
were of old.

Ans. The halfe-reason or incomplete moral ground of the How far a moral and
perpetual reas^n makes a law perpetual.
law is not the soul of the law: But you must take in all the reasons, the
words of the text are these. Thou shall not desire the silver and gold that is
on them, nor take it to thee, lest thou be ensnared therein: for it is an
abomination unto the Lord thy God. v. 26. Neither shall thou bring an
abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it. Now what
made that Gold an abomination to the Lord, more then all the gold of the earth?
it is of it self the good and useful creature of God, no less then all the
gold of the earth: nothing made it an abomination to God, but, if we look to
the original cause, there was a positive, free command of God forbidding
Israel to covet, or use that Gold. The Canaanites themselves, by the law of
nature might lawfully have melted that same very Gold, and made use of it,
without sin. 2. It is not a good reason, Such a law had a mor^ll and
perpetual reason. Ergo, the law it self is perpetual and moral. It
follows only: Ergo, the morality of that law is perpetual. For all the
Ceremonial laws had a moral and perpetual reason: As the shadows had a moral
substantial ground in Christ the body of all shadows: but it does not follow
therefore the shadows and Ceremonial law in the letter must be perpetual:
Very often in the book of Leviticus, there is no Levit. c^. 11.
reason given of the Ceremonial laws. But, be ye holy, I am the Lord, that
sanctifies you. This is a moral and perpetual reason, that endures to the
end of the world, yet it is no due consequence: therefore all these shadows
and Ceremonies shall endure to the end of the world, The reason is, because it
is the sole positive will of God that makes a temporary concatenation between
not eating blood, and not being cruel, and between sacrificing and being holy,
and yet not being cruel is perpetual, not eating blood temporary. (3) If
things indifferent, as the eating of flesh, before a weak Jew, Romans 14. be a
snare to my own soul and to the souls of others: I am to abstain from these
and the like. But that I must abstain from the total use of any creature that
God has made useful for the life of man, by the law of creation, as Israel was
to abstain from the cattle of the Amalakites, and to stamp in powder, and
make altogether useless the Gold and Silver of the heathen Idol-Gods, is
altogether unlawful, and a very Judaizing, and its to make, as Paul says,
Jesus Christ of no effect.

Object. 3. But at least we are to abstain, for scandalls sake, from
worshipping the true God, in these Temples, and houses abused to idolatry lest
we lay a stumbling* block before others, even as the Romans and Corinthians
were to abstain from meats, before such weak Jews, as conceived these meats
to be unlawful; seeing the loss of such meats and abst^nence, for a time* was
nothing comparable to the loss of one soul for whom Christ died, so the
losing of the use of a material house in a religious use* so it be employed to
some civil use, and be not totally lost, is nothing comparable to the
scan^alizing and i^sn^ring of the souls* both of Jews and weak Christians,
which will certainly follow* if we use Temples dedicated to Saints in Gods
worship.

Ans. It is true, the loss of the use of a material Temple, is nothing
comparable to active scandal, which is the destroying of any soul. But the
refusing to worship God in these material Temples because abused to Idolatry,
were not only a disusing Disusing of houses because abused to idolatry, a
Iudaising.
of the creature, without any warrant from God, but an open Judaizing and an
active scandal both to Jews and Christians, though we should employ the
houses to civil use, for any external conformity with the Jews, when the
thing is not indifferent, in religious acts, such as is the disusing of the
Churches, is Iudaising: for should we now use Circumcision and the Passover*
with an open, printed and professed intention to signify Christ already come
in the flesh, and should make an open declaration against the Jewish intention
in these ordinances; we should no less Iudaize, then Peter, who Gal. 2. did
only practice an external conformity with the Jews, with no Jewish
intention, sure he was persuaded that Christ was already come in the flesh: yet
was he justly rebuked, by Paul, for Iudaizing. For the loss of an house in a
material or physical use of it, I grant it is not comparable to the loss of
a Son. But the losing of it on a religious ground, is another thing. When the
religious loss of the house is not indifferent, as was the Abstinence from
some meats indifferent then, but sinfully scandalous before a weak brother.

Ob. 4. But if the worshipping of the true God in these material temples, be
no less an ensnaring of us in popish Idolatry, then the using of the Gold and
Silver of the Canaanites Idols, then we are to disuse all worshipping of God in
these houses, as well as they were: But the former is true, for we may be no
less ensnared with material houses, then they.

Ans. I deny the major Proposition* for the eating of blood, the taking of both
the young bird* and the damme in the nest, was an insnaring of the Jews to
cruelty, through their abuse of the creatures, the use whereof God* had made
both lawful and necessary to them in the Creation. The blood was the life of
the beast, and the Lord requires in us mercy* to our beasts life, whereas the
tender mercies of the wicked are cruel* Prove. 12. 10. yet is it not lawful
for us to devise any way, we please, to keep us from being snared in cruelty,
for then upon the same ground, it were unlawful for us to eat blood, contrary
to the express word of God, Romans 14 14. 1 Cor. 10. 25. 26. 1 Timothy 4* 3. 4. God
by a positive and Ceremonial Command hedged in the people of the Jews, from
being ensnared in Idolatry, and, by some Ceremonies, taught them to detest all
Idolatry: but it does not follow, that we Christians are to inure our hearts,
from being ensnared with Idols, and to a detestation of Idolatry, by these
same Ceremonies that they were commanded, for then we were obliged to stamp
the Golden and Silver idols, to dustand powder: and to cast the powder into the
river as Moses did the Golden Calse, Deuteronomy. 9. 21. and behoved to drink of that
water, Exodus 32. 20. 1 Chro. 15. 16. 2 King. 18. 4. so it follows no ways,
though the physical use of a material Temple, should ensnare us to Idolatry,
that we are therefore to disuse that house; except we had the same Ceremonial
command to warrant us, that the Jews had, and by this argument, you may bring
us back to observe all the Ceremonies of Moses his law, Because all these
Ceremonies were appointed in the wisdom of God, either to keep us from being
ensnared in some sin, and to raise, in our heart, a detestation thereof, or
to teach us somewhat of Christ, of whom we be naturally ignorant and forgetful.

Ob. 5. But at your first reformation of the Church of Scotland, your
Reformers, such as M. Knox, and others* demolished most of the fairest Churches
in that Land, and for no other reason, but because they had been nests of
popish idolatry.

Ans. That Churches in so far as their use extends, farther then to the
commodious propulsation of injuries of Sun and Ai^e, be demolished, we can
well allow, for these that were demolished by our Reformers of blessed memory;
nor so spacious and inconvenient for hearing the word of God and celebration of
the Sacraments, being ordained for Masses, Idols, for blind superstition, that
the very length, breadth, height, beauty, and glory of them might redound to
the glory of Saints and Idols, that it was reason they should be demolished in
so far as they conduced nothing for the physical and necessary end, for
which Churches are ordained under the New Testament; And thus far we allow of
the breaking of Images, Crosses, Crucifixes, and all Monuments of Idolat^ie, so
as the matter of all these, whether Timber, Marble stones, Metal of Gold,
Silver, Brass, or the like to be employed, for the necessary use of man's
life, but that all their superstitious form and Bells for the convening of the
people to public worship not to be abolished, ^^ough they have been abused to
superstition.
religious use be utterly abolished. As for the abolishing of Bells abused in
time of Popery; because they have a necessary and Physical use to give
warning for the seasonable conveneing of the people of God, to the public
worship, I see no ground, for it, from Deuteronomy. 7. or other places, but we must be
necessitate to stamp to powder the very Metal of Bells, and to render them
not only useless in Churches, but any other way tending to the good of man's
l^^e.

Object. But Number. 31. 21, 22. raiment and skins* and vessels of wood taken from
Midian, though taken as spoil were purified, and the Gold and silver, brass,
iron, etc. were purified by fire, and not made useless, so the Churches
dedicated to Mary, Peter, and to Angels, and Sains, are not to be made
useless, they may be employed for the poor to dwell in* but they can have no
religious use in the worship of God, except we would heal the wounds of the
daughter of Babel.

Ans. I deny not but Churches dedicated to Saints, and in regard of their vain
and ostentive spaciousness unprofitable for hearing the Word, may be employed
to civil uses for ordinary dwelling; But I see no ground how this can be
according to the places cited by our godly Brethren of the contrary mind
except the Churches were first purified, in some Ceremonial way, as God
prescribes that the spoil of Midian be purified, which our Brethren cannot
say, except we would make our selves debtors to the whole Law, for so the law
was, Number. 31. and so Paul does reject Circumcision, Gal 5. 3. and if it be said
the necessity of the poor requires that these Temples be not loosed, but
employed for the poor, as David in point of necessity eat the Shewbread. I
answer 1. The poor, as the case was, Romans 14. might eat Swines flesh, and so
ruin him, for whom Christ died, which is absurd for their necessity might
require it. But certain it is, David's necessity was laid on him by the sixth
Commandment as an act of mercy in the point of starving, and if any poor Jew
were in the like case, I conceive it should have been scandalizing to that Jew
to eat Swines-flesh, before another weak Jew. Providentiall necessity may
make that which is a sinful scandalizing to be obedience to the sixth
Commandment, but the will of Superiors can make no such providentiall change
as the D* of Aberdeene do dream* But if the necessity be less then the
Necessity in point of sterving, it could justify the poor Jews eating of
meats conceived to be against the law of God, as the case was, Romans 14. But
that the Church or house dedicated to a Saint, should have no physical use in
the worship of God, to defend us from the injuries of Sun and Heaven, and yet
have the same use* in common, for the poor to dwell in, wants all shadow of
reason, for how can it be proven that the same physical use in the worship is
unlawful, and yet out of worship is lawful* except there intervene some
Ceremonial and religious purging of the house, by fire or some other way,
which were Iudaical under the New Testament, for the necessity of the poor, is
not like the necessity of David's eating of Shewbread: Its certain, that the
necessity of disusing the creature in a Physical usage, in the worship, must
have a warrant in Scripture, as well as the using of the same, in the same
usage, must have the like warrant.

Object. 5. But Bells are more hurtful to the souls of Gods people, who are
scandalized by them, then they are useful for the tymous and seasonable
convening of the people, and therefore they may well be abolished, being less
necessary, and necessary only ad melius esse, for the better ordering of the
Worship of God, and not simply necessary for the being of the Worship. Now as
the Lord our God will have a lesser necessity to yield to any greater, a bodily
necessity to give place to a soul-necessity (the soul being more excellent then
the body) as is clear in that God would have his people to dispense with the
lesser loss of the spoil of the Amalakites of their Idols, gold and silver,
that the greater necessity may stand, to wit, their not being allured, nor
their teeth put a watering, and their heart to a lusting after the Idols of
Canaan; so would he have us to abolish the Saints Temples, the gold of Popish
Images, the Bells that are less necessary (seeing the Sun may teach as well as
the Bell) for eschewing soul-dangers in laying stumbling blocks, both before
our own souls, and others.

Answ. 1. It is denied, that Bells which have a necessary use, though only for
the better ordering of the worship of God, are any active objects of scandal,
and the mere passive scandal taken at any thing not indifferent, but physically
necessary, and so necessary, that without it sinful inconvenients of either
wearying in the service of God, or sinful neglect should follow, is no sinful
scandal given, but merely taken.

2. There be two necessities of things, one natural, and first in that regard,
another religious, and in that regard secondary; the former necessity does
always stand, except God remove it by some posteriour commandment. Its
necessary, that Adam and Evah eat of all things that God created for eating.
God (I grant) may remove this necessity in some, and command either Adam to
fast for a time, or not to eat of the tree of Knowledge: So say I, warning by
Bells has a physical necessity, the use of the Temples in worshipping has the
like necessity, so have Gold and Silver a necessity. god only, either by a
Commandment, or by an exigence of providence that stands to us (as in the
case of a scandal) for a command can remove the physical necessity, and
inhibite Israel to use such and such Gold, as have been in use in the Heathen
Idols, and may forbid to perform an act of obedience to an affirmative command
in the case of scandal* as he may forbid Paul to take wages for Preaching the
Gospel, though Paul have some natural necessity of taking wages. But the Church
without a higher warrant from God, has no power to restrain us in the
necessary use that God has given us. Make Bells and Temples as indifferent and
unnecessary as some meats were, Romans 14. and I shall yield the Argument.

3. That the Lord our God will have a bodily necessity as the smaller, to yield
to a soul-necessity as the greater, is a ground not so sure, but it ought to
have been proved, except by a soul-necessity, you mean a necessity of saving
the soul, and not sinning against God, and oppose it to a mee^ bodily
necessity, including no sin in it* then I shall grant the Assertion, That the
one necessity i^ greater then the other. But otherwise, Cateris paribus, other
things being alike, I conceive it is contradicted by Jesus Christ's saying,
Matthew. 12. cited out of Hosea, Chap. 6. I will have me^^^, and not sacrifice:
And here we must determine the case of scandal to the soul from the exsuperance
of necessity to the body and life. The case falls out, David and his
followers are at the point of starving for hunger (it may be a question if the
present necessity be so great) there being no bread for them, but the
Shewbread, which by a Ceremonial Law of God, only the Priests should eat: If
any of the followers of David out of a groundless scrupulosity of conscience
should have taken Paul's Argument, Romans 14. and said to David* I will starve
rather ere I eat this bread; for a divine law forbid^ me; and if* thou eat of
it, it shall be a scandal to ^^, and will thou for bread destroy him for whom
Christ died? The Apostle Paul would not, for so small a thing, as to eat swines
flesh before a weak Jew, in the case, Romans 14. destroy the soul of one for whom
Christ died, by laying before him a stumbling block, by his unseasonable and
scandalous eating. I think (if Scripture cannot possibly be contrary to
Scripture) this doubt might easily be removed, by answering the case was not
alike with David in his hunger, and so in a Physical and natural necessity
to save his own temporal life, that by all probability was in great danger,
and these who being in no such necessity, did eat such meats scandalous, and
so distructive to the souls of weak ones, and having variety of other meats
to keep them from sterving, and so a mere necessity of preserving the bodily
life, if we compare one affirmative command of God, with another, may remove
that which may be supposed a soul necessity. And the reason is, because in
the doctrine of scandal, which is more intricate and obscure then every A most
necessary rule to be observed in the doctrine of scandal, that emergent
providence of natural necessity are to us in place of divine commands, in
some cases.
Divine conceives, God places acts of providentiall necessity as emergent
significations of his approving will, which are so to us, in place of a divine
Commandment of Gods revealed will, and these providentiall acts of necessity
do no less oblige us to moral obedience, then any of the express written
Commandments of God. I clear it thus. There is an express law. It is s^^ and
unlawful for David, or any man, who is not one of the Lords Priests, to eat
shewbread. But God comes in, and puts David in such a posture of divine
providence, that if he eat not shewbread, he shall be sinfully guilty of
violating a higher moral law of God, who says, I will have mercy and not
sacrifice. Then David shall be cruel to his own life, and sin against the
sixth Commandment. Thou shall do no murder. If he eat not, for not to eat,
when you are in a providentiall condition of sterving, if you may have it, is
to kill your self, and this providentiall condition does no less oblige you
to the Moral obedience of the sixth Command, then if God in the letter of the
Law should command you to eat. This fact of David was not done by any
extraordinary impulsion of the Spirit, but by a constant channel that
Providence ordinarily runs in, according to which I, or any Professor must
be obliged to prefer a work of Mercy to Sacrifice, that is, by which we are
to give obedience to the sixth Command, which is not to kill, even as without
extraordinary impulsion, I may absent my self from hearing the Word, when I
find going to Church may endanger my life, for non-obedience to affirmatives,
in a greater necessity* is ordinary. And therefore Christian prudence, with
which the Wisdom of God keeps house, Prove. 8. 12. does determine many things
of scandal: And prudence is a virtue commanded in the word of God, for a wise
man observes times, and so will he observe all other circumstances, yet there
be rules here which stands always, and they be these. 1. Comparing a

and merely natural necessity with a moral necessity* if we yield to the
physical necessity, and neglect the moral, we sin against God, and may lay
a stumbling block before others; as to eat such meats, where the loss is
small, and the necessity of eating merely physical, and the eating be a
scandal to the weak, we sin and give scandal, the case is clear, Romans 14.

necessity. 2. Rule, if we compare a greater moral necessity with a less
moral necessity, the less necessity must yield to the greater, a necessity
of mercy must yield to a necessity of sacrificeing; if David then should not
have eaten the shewbread, in his providentiall necessity of samine, he should
have been guilty both of active scandalizing the souls of others in killing
himself, and should have killed himself, and the less moral necessity

necessity interveneth. 3. Rule* Where there is a physical necessity of the
thing, yet not extreme, and a moral necessity of abstinence, we are to
abstain; The Jews had a physical necessity of the Babylonish Garments, but
not so extreme, in point of perishing, through cold, as David had of
Shewbread* in point of sterving for famine, therefore Achan should have obeyed
the moral necessity of not touching the accursed thing* and neglected the
physical necessity, which if it had amounted to the degrees of necessity of
mercy, rather then obeying a Ceremonial Command, such as was ( Touch not the
accursed spoil) Ach^^ might, without sin or scandal, to himself or others,

meddled with the spoil. 4. Rule. That which is necessary, in specie, in the
kind, as to go to Church and hear the Word, to come to the house of God and
Worship, may be, in individuo, in a particular exigence of providence, not
morally necessary, but the contradicent thereof morally lawful. David does
lawfully forbear to come to the Lords house, if he knew Saul may kill him, by

the way. ^* The things which we are to forbear only for necessity of
scandal, and upon no other ground, these I may do in private, if I know they
cannot come to the notice of these who shall be scandalized, upon the ground of
less physical necessity; as Romans 14. believers, for their necessity
ordinary, and for nourishment, might eat fleshes in private, though before a
weak Jew they could n^^* because the sin is not in the act of eating, but
wholly in the scandal, and in the manner of the unseasonable doing of it. But
these things which are morally not necessary, because t^^ ^^bstance of the
fact is against a law we are to forbear, both in private, because they are
against a law, and in public before others, for the scandal. as Achan sinned
in taking the Babilonish Garment, though in private, and his sin should have
been more scandalous, if he had done it publicly; Now these we are upon no
ordinary necessity to do, but such as may incroach upon the hazard of the
loss of life, in which case an exigence of providence, does stand for a
Command of nonmurthering, had Saul and his Army been reduced to a danger

of starving in a wilderness, and could have no food, except they should kill,
and eat the Cattle of the Am^l^kites, ^ conceive, The Lords preferring of
Mercy before Sacrifice, should warrant them to eat of the Amalakites Cattle,
yet would this providentiall necessity be so limited, as it may fall out, that
it stand not for a divine Command; for it holds in affirmative commands only,
and 2. so positives as there must be, yea there can be no sin eligible by such
and such a case, as Lot sinned in exposing his daughters to the lust of men, to
redeem abstinence from Sodomie.

Hence it is clear; we may not do a less, nor counsel another to commit a
less sin, to eschew a greater; as the Jesuits wickedly teach. So Tannerus,
so Turrianus and others who make a scandalum permissum, a scandal that a
Christian may hinder another to fall in, and yet he permits him to fall in
it. But God has a prerogative to permit sinful scandals, men have no such
power, when they are obliged to hinder it. The divinite of others seems
better to me, who deny that the least venial should be committed to eschew a
greater sin.

6. Rule. There is a principle obligation, a less principle, a least
principle. Hence these three degrees issue from love, 1. God* 6. Rule.
2. Our selves, 3. Our Neighbor: The love of God is most principle, and is the
measure of the love of our selves: the love of our self is less principal,
then the love of God, and so the obligation less. I am to make away, life and
all things, yea eternal glory as divided from holiness, and as it includes
only happiness, rather ere I sin against God* The obligation to care for my
own salvation, is more principal, then my obligation to care for the
salvation of my Brother: for the love of my self is the measure and rule of
the love of my Neighbor. Now because the obligation of caring for the soul of
my brother is only secondarie, in compare of the obligation of caring for my
own salvation, I am not to sin my self, or sinfully to omit any thing that
is commanded me in a positive precept, to prevent the sin of my brother* Yet
hence it does not follow, that a positive Precept is more excellent, then the
law of Nature, which is ( Thou shall not murder, nor scandalize him for whom
Christ died.) Because though to care for the soul of my brother be of the law
of nature simpliciter, yet is a secondarie obligation* and may cease and yield,
to a stronger obligation that tyeth me more principally to care, for my own
soul* for though the Command be positive, yet knowingly to sin, by a sinful
omission, is no less a destroying of my own soul, and so of the law of
nature, in a higher obligation, then the other is.

Formalists in this conspire* with them, even though from this do flow the
ruin of many souls: and though the sinful scandalizing and ruin of these
souls, flow from sinful corruption of either ignorance or frailty, or

pretended obedience to an unlawful command, for the thing commanded having no

Men are scandalized through their own ignorance and Malice. Ergo the scandal
is taken, and not given, for these who were enemies to the Truth, and were so
scandalized at David's murdering of Uriah, and Adultery, 2 Samuel 12. 14. as
they were by him occasioned to blaspheme. Certain their actual scandal was
from their own corruption. But what? Ergo, it was not also from David's murder
and adultery? and ergo it was a scandal Caspensis, tom. 3. Curs Theolog.

only taken by the enemies, not given by David? Surely it solloweth not. You
may hence judge of the Rule of Lodo Caspensis, a Capucean. These (says he)
that do a work of it self indifferent, for a weighty cause, and use their
own right, ^tuta^tur suo jure, are excused from mortal sin, as these who
let a house to Whores, and public Usurers, that are not strangers, though
they may commodiously let it to others, they do not cooperate with sin,
because the house it but a place, and extrinsecall and remote to the sin. So
Christians taken by Turks for danger of their life, (which is a weighty
necessity) may furnish instruments necessary for war against Christians
because they do a work indifferent of it self, for a just cause: so may a
servant convey his Master to a Whore, yea and make the Bed for a Concubine* and
open the door, and if his Master be to climb in at a window to a whore he may
lift up his foot, or reach him a ladder. Why? the servant (says he) uses his
own right in doing a work of it self indifferent, U^itur suo jure faciens
opus exse indifferens, modo non placeat ei peccatum.

houses, and that Captives and servants have to their Masters and Lords, is jus
limitatum, a right ruled, limited* bounded by the word of God, nor is the work
they perform morally indifferent, (physically it is) and Captive Christians,
if for danger of their life, they may prepare necessary instruments of war
against Christians, they may kill Christians also: for what power the
conquering Lords have over Captives to command them to prepare fire and sword,
against the innocent witnesses of Jesus Christ, because they are such, the same
jus right have they to command to kill the innocent. But for no cause the most
weighty, can we choose either to shed innocent blood, or to cooperate with the
shedding of it, nor to cooperate with the works of darkness, for it is
shameful that a servant may lawfully cooperate with, and thrust his master in
at a window, to go* to a whore, the jus or dominion of Masters to command, and
the right of servants to obey is only in the Lord. Yea to kill a man is
Physically indifferent, for that is physically, yea morally without relation to
any law indifferent, which is capable of lawfulness, or unlawfulness,
according as it shall be commanded of, or forbidden by God. But for a man to
kill his son, is of it self such, certain, if God command a Judge to kill his
son, it is lawful for the father to kill his son, if the Lord forbid Abraham
to kill his son, it is unlawful for Abraham to kill his son. And therefore
Caspensis has no more reason to use the Instance of captives preparing war
against innocent Christians and of a servant thrusting his Master in at door
or window to a whore, then of captives killing the innocent, or of servants
breaking a house, and taking away the goods of a man in the night* or of
servants committing whoredom at the command of their Conquerors or Lords, the
one kind of action in it self is as indifferent and susceptible of moral
lawfulness, and unlawfulness, as the other. And if the Master do cooperate
to commit harlotrie in climbing in at a window to a whore, and to robbing, in
digging through an innocent man's house in the night, to kill the Master of the
house, and to steal his goods, then the servant that co-operateth in these
same physical actions, and also diggeth through the innocent man's house and
kills himself, is the harlot, and the robber, by cooperation and
participation, no less then the Master. The naked No relation of servant or
captive can render it lawful to cooperate with sin.
relation of a captive, and of a servant, cannot make the captive and servant
innocent and guiltless co-operators, for then to sin at the command of any
Conqueror and Master, because I am in the condition of a captive and servant,
were lawful, though God forbid and inhibite me to do, what I do, by the
command of my Master and Conqueror, for in so doing, Utor meo jure, I use my
right as a servant. For God forbids me in what relation I be in, servant, or
Captive, to sin, at the command of any, or for declining any ill of
punishment* Though as weighty as the torment of hell separated from sinful
dispairing and blaspheming of God. Now to cooperate with that which I know to
be a sin, is to partake in other men's sins, which is forbidden, as a sin,
1 Timothy 5. 22. Ephesians. 5. 11. But to run with the thief, and to help an
Arch-robber, Prove. 1. 13. 14. is a consenting to his robbery and bloodshed.
And to help any to dig through a house, or to climb in at a window to Incest,
Sodomie, Buggerie, to fetch a beast to the Master who rages in the sin of
Beastialitie, or to setch a young man to the Master or Conqueror to the sin
of abominable Sodomie, knowing the Master and conquerors mind is to cooperate
to Beastialitie and Sodomie, is as high a measure of sinful cooperating in
these abominations, as for the servant to help up, or life up his Master, to
go in, at a window to an harlot, for this is a consent to these sins, and a
consent in the highest degree; so to give a knife to a Master, who seeks it
from his servant, to kill his Father, Mother, Prince, Pastor, is to consent
formally to such horrible paricides, and therefore Caspensis should have
brought instances in Bugrie, Sodomie, Parricide, when as he used softer Names
of fornication and harlotrie.

8. The non-necessaries, or such things as need not be in the 8. Rule. What
things non-necessarie are to be removed from the worship of God, as scand lous.
worship of God, which do bring scandal, Must 1. be such as are neither
necessary in specie, nor in individuo, in kind, or in spece or nature, or in
their individuals and particulars, as the whole Categorie of Men's devises, as

1. Unwritten traditions -- not necessary, not written. 2. Humane mystical,
symbolical signs and Ceremonies -- not necessary, not written. 3. Humane holy
days, crossing, kneeling to Elements, Altars, Crossing, Surplice, Rochets,
etc, -- not necessary, not written. 4. This and this humane holy day, this
crossing -- not necessary, not written. Ceremonies not so much as necessary
by way of dis-junction, which necessity agrees to many circumstances of
worship in the Directory.

2. These things are judged not necessary, that are not necessary by way of
dis-junction, as Surplice is not necessary by way of dis-junction, for neither
is Surplice necessary, nor any other white or red habit, that has some
mystical religious signification, like unto Surplice; So kneeling to the
Elements is neither Necessary, nor any the like religious honoring of them,
by prostration before them, o^ kissing them.

But, the things of the Directorie for the public worship, as many of them are
necessary, and have express warrant in the Word, as Praying, Preaching,
Sacraments, Praising, etc. So 2. some things that are non-necessaries in the
individual or particular words, or things, yet are they not to be removed in
their alternative necessity, either this or the like though some be thereby
scandalized. Because though they be not necessary simply, yet are they
necessary by way of dis-junction, as that the Minister say, either these, or
the like words, for words to that sense are necessary. So the order that the
Directorie prescribes in citing such and such acts of Divine worship is
necessary either this way, or a way as convenient not different from this, for
some order of necessity there must be. So the Liturgy or Service Book, what
ever Jos. Hall say on the contrary (as it is little that he does, or can say)
though it should contain many things necessary in specie, in the kind, sit
for the external public worshipping of God, yet because these words in
Individuo, in their particulars are not necessary, is to be re^oved, because
though all the matter were good (as much of it is Popish) yet that book in its
structure, frame, style, Grammar, method, and form is popish, and framed
after the model of the Roman Missale, especially performed with the cursed
Authority of the Council of Trent, under Pius the fifth, in all the Masses,
Rubricks, Epistles, Gospels, etc. is scandalous, and a Directorie in Scripture
words is better, and is therefore justly laid aside by the Revevent Assembly,
and honorable Court of parliament, because there is scandal in words, in
style and language, in divine worship. And these who will abstain from
practicing of some things in the Directorie, for fear of scandalizing others,
must give reasons from the Word that these things they forbear, are neither
necessary simply, nor by way of dis-junction. Because as I conceive, Things
neither necessary in the same individuals, nor by way of dis-junction, are
such Non-necessaries as are to be removed out of the worship of God, for fear
of scandal. And that any such non-necessaries can be found in the Directorie,
I do not see as yet.

Ob. The people had the more opinion of Dietie in the thing they adored the
baser it was. None has any such opinion of the cross. Ergo, it is no
scandalous object. Ans. All our Divines hold, that Heathens of old, and Papists
of late, worship Images, as religious memorative signs of God, Hooker with one
dash of his Pen, against the Prophets and Scriptures, acquiteth them of
Idolatry, therefore the Cross may be adored, without any opinion of Dietie in
it.

Obj. Be it true, that crosses were purposely appointed to ^^^ adored, yet not
so now. The Jews would not admit of the Image of Caesar in the Church, yet
they abolished it not, but admitted it in their coin. The adored cross
differs as far from this, as the Brazen Serpent that Solomon made to bear
up the Cisterne of the Temple, and that which Israel adored in the wilderness,
And the Altars that Josiah destroyid, as being mere Instruments Hooker. Ibid.
of Idolatry, and that which the Tribe of Reuben ^rected beyond Jordan.
Solomon distroyed not the Temple and Idols framed only of purpose for the
worship of forrains Gods, because Religious Monuments of Idolatry are to be
removed.
they stood now as forlorn, and did no harm. Josiah afterward razed them for
some inconvenients, yet God says both these Kings, in religion walked
straightly.

Ans. 1. Though the Cross were first framed for no adoration; yet we plead
against the Images and Crosses of Lutherans as not necessary, in divine
worship, and therefore to be removed, though never adored.

2. The people think Baptism incomplete without the Cross, Ergo, to them it
has the like necessity, as water.

3. How will Hooker prove never any burnt Incense to the Brazen Serpent, but
believed it really to be God? that is his dream, beside the Text.

4. By this Luther ^^^ have their desire; for actual intention that Images be
lawful remembrancers of Christ, without intention of adoration, shall make
Images as lawful teaching Ceremonies, as Hooker will have the sigue of the
Cross.

5. We remove not crosses from coin, no more then the Jews did the image of
C^s^r. But we agree with them. Hooker being judge, in Banishing them from the
worship.

6. Ezechiah then might have broken the old, and made a new Brazen Serpent, for
a memorial of the miraculous cure, so they had not burnt Incen^e to it; The
remembrance of the old mercy should have been as good in the new, as in the
old. But Wolphius, who adds to P. Mar^yr, Commen^. in 2 King. 23. speaking of
Ios^^^^ zeal Et h^c illius fides, and industria nos quoque excitabit, ^t in
odium and f^stidium earum, quae pugnant, cum D^i verbo, rerum, bomines qu^quo
modo inducamus.
certainly the Brazen Serpent was not destroyed as Brass, but in all its
religious use. It was not purged, but abolished.

7. If we may make Images and Orasses alike in shape, but dislike in use, in
Gods worship, we may bring in Golden Calves to the Temples, and the Image of
Dagon, and the Sidonian Gods, and Altars such as Josiah destroyed, so at their
first moulding we imprint on them, chaste and innocent religious intencions and
signification, and make them alike in shape, but dislike in use to heathen
worship. But sure the Calfe of Egypt, and the Calfe that Aaron made, though
like in shape, yet were dislike in use.

8. We read of no new Inconvenients that the Images and Temples that Solomon
erected to strange Gods, did in Josiahs time, which they did not in ^^^ekiahs
time, but that they were Monuments of Idolatry in both; It seems that Nooker
would commend Ezechiah, for not demolishing the Images of Salomons outlandish
Gods; But then it was Josiahs zeal without knowledge, that he demolished them.
2. We then might well suffer the Images of Jupiter, Dagon, Ashtarosh to stand
before the people publicly, so they do no harm^: and Papists and Lutherans
say the Images of Christ and the Saints do^ no harm, when the Pastors
carefully teach the people, that there is no Dietie^ nor God-h^ad dwelling in
them. 3. We say the sign of the Cross is a mere instrument of Idolatry and
Superstition, and what ever good intention, or pious signification was stamped
on it, at the first, by men's carnal wisdom and will zeal, it no more made it
good, then if upon the Image of Dagon, you would found the like good intention
and pious signification.

9. Though Ezechiah was commended by God, it no more follows his omission in
not demolishing Salomons outlandish Idols must belawfull, and a part of his
upright walking in ^^ matters of religion, then because David is commended, as
walking uprightly in all things, save in the matter of Uriah, that his
numbering of the people, his revengefull attempt to destroy Nabal and all his,
must also be a part of David's walking uprightly before God.

10. Solomon had a warrant for the Brazen Image in the Temple, not to abolish
it. But Ezechiah had no warrant not to Abolish the Brazen Serpent, after the
people burnt Incense to it, even suppose the People should, upon the
exhortation of the Priests, have desisted from burning Incense to it. I see
not, if Images may be lawful Remembrancers to us, so we adore them not; But
the Golden Calves, the Images that Solomon made to outlandish Gods, the Image
of Diana, and all the heathen Images that the Word speaks against should be
brought into the Christian Churches, to teach us to flee, and eschew the
adoring of these abominations, for we have as great need of Ceremonial and
Historical remembrancers to teach us to eschew evil, as to admonish us to
follow good. But the truth is, except we will be wiser then God, we need
neither.

Obj. Some things are of their own nature scandalous, and Hooker Eccle.
Policy, ^ l. 5. 349 350. 2 King 23. 7.
cannot choose but breed offense as those sinkes of execrable filth which
Josiah did turn out: Some things though not by nature generally, and of
themselves, are generally turned to evil through a corrupt habit grown, and
uncurably settled in the minds of men, without the removal of the thing, as
was the worshipping of the Brazen Serpent. But some, as the Cross though
subject either almost, or altogether to as much corruption, are yet curable
with more facility and ease.

Ans. Objects sinful and so intrinsecally scandalous are to be removed, as the
Image of Jupiter, Molech, both because sins, and and so not necessary. 2.
Because scandalous, for the truth is, even sins (if we speak accurately) are
not scandalous actum secundo, in regard of our corruption, our sins may sad
the Angels, but they are not properly scandalous to Angels, and therefore every
thing actively scandalous, as scandalous is to be removed. 2. How does Hooker
prove that the Vessels made for Baal, are in their own nature more incurable
then the sign of the Cross? You may remove the superstitious intention and
Idolatrous use of any vessel, and turn it to a good use; Yet Josiah burnt
them to ashes. The like may be said of the Groves which he stamped to powder,
and cast in the brook Kidron, And of the Chariots five of the Sun, which he
burnt with fire, and of the bones of dead men, not any of these, being of their
own nature more indifferent, and innocent creatures of God, were of their own
nature more scandalous, and more uncurable then the sign of the Cross. The
like may be said of Altars, and I pray are reasonable men, the Priests of the
high places of their own nature uncurable? are they not capable of repentance,
and curable by doctrine? yet 2 King. 23. 20. Josiah slew all the Priests of the
high places. 3. Teaching may remove evil customs, otherwise how should the
Gospel convert sinners, that are accustomed from the womb to do evil? Jer.
13. 23. Jer. 22. 21. Ephesians. 2. 1. 2. 3. 4. Tit. 3. 3. 4 5. therefore scandalous
objects of the second kind, are no more to be removed, then the Sign of the
Cross. 4. It is false, that scandalous objects of the third sort are more
easily cured, except they be removed, for no humane prudence, when the sign of
the Cross, and the Brazen serpent, are sure, not necessary in Gods worship.
And when men have, and so still may abuse them to Superstition and Idolatry,
can make these being now actively scandalous, to be not actively scandalous, as
no ar^ can make a pite to be no pite. Indeed Gods ordinances, because
necessary, may be cured, from scandal by teaching. But it is Gods only
prerogative, by his commanding will to make a thing, not necessary in his
worship, to be necessary, and to alter the nature of things, so as his command
could have made the Brazen Serpent, to remain a lawful teaching Sign, and no
scandalous object, and only he might have forbidden the burning of Incense to
it. The Ancient Ignatius, or any had no warrant to make confession of Christ
before enemies and mockers, by gestures or crossing, Paul did it not, Peter
commands confession to be verbal, 1 Pet. 3. 14. 15,

There be many ancient laws, yea Divine and Apostolic constitutions Hooker,
198.
acknowledged to be good, that the Church has laid aside. Some things cannot
be removed without danger of greater evils to succeed in their place. Wisdom
must give place to necessity. Seneca, Necessitas, quicquid coegit, defendit.

Ans. 2. We know no necessity to have, nor any danger to want such wares, as
Surplice, Crossing, bowing to Altars, to elements, which sure the Apostolic
Church wanted, both in specie, and in individuo. The like Papists say for
adoring of Images, that Hooker here says, for Surplice, and the like Scandals.
So does the Jesuit Tannerus say, in. 22. to. 3, dis. 5. de religione. q. ^.
dub. 3. Quando dicitur Adorationem imaginum non esse licitam, qui non est
scripta. Respo. (inquit) apostol^ familiari Spiritus instinctu quadam Ecclesiis
tradider^nt Servanda que non reliquerunt in scriptis -- inter hujusmodi
Traditiones est Imaginum Christi adoratio.

Quest. VII.
Whether or no to use the indifferent Customs of heathen and Papists, in the
worship of God, be scandalous,

WE are altogether of this mind, that a material What Conformity with
Idolaters is unlawful.
Similitude between the truee Church and the false, is not scandalous. Because
Rome holds that there is one God, it follows not, therefore it is unlawful
for us to hold there is one God. 2. There is a formal Similitude, as because
the heathen kill their children to Molech, ergo, the Children of Israel should
not do so to the Lord their God. M. Hooker grants there should be a
dis-similitude between the true Church and Heathens in this, and the
Similitude (say they) is unlawful. But 3. the Adversaries draw us to a third
dis-similitude between the true Church, and the Popish, and heathenish Church,
and this is a mixed Similitude, that we should use indifferent R^tes and
Customs in Gods worship, as Crossing, new devised days, Surplice etc. which
are used by Papists, and Heathens. This say our Adversaries, is not an
unlawful Similitude, yea with edification and profit (say they) we may thus
far conform with them.

2. This conformity does gain them, not Scandalize them* say they.

But we hold that this conformity is unlawful and a dissimilitude commanded.

1. It is expressly said Levit. 18. 3. I am the Lord your God, after the doings
of the Land of Egypt, wherein ^e^ dwelt, shall ye not do: And after the
doings of the Land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do; Neither
shall ye walks in their ordinances. 4. Ye shall do my judgments, and keep
min^ ordinances, to walk therein, I am the Lord your God. Hence if God be a
Conformity with Idolaters in things, in Gods worship, not necessary,
unlawful.
God, in a peculiar manner, in covenant with his Church, then may not his
Church take a rule of worship, and walking from other profane Churches and
people, such as Egypt, Canaan, and whorish Rome. There is an Instance given in
things of their own nature indifferent, Levit. 19. with the same Argument. 27.
Ye shall not round the corners of your heads,* neither shall tho^ mar the
corners of thy Beard. 28. Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the
dead, I am the Lord. Certain a greater scandal cannot be, then that those who
are in Covenant with God, should borrow significant Ceremonies of sorrowing for
the dead, Levit. 19. 19. Ye shall keep my Statutes? Thou shall not let thy
cattle gender with diverse kind: Thou shall not sow thy field with mingled
seed: Neither shall a garment mingled of linen and wool come upon thee. Hence
there is a clear opposition made between Gods statutes. Ye shall heepe my
statutes, and the statutes of Canaan. The Can^^^^tes might wear Garments of
linen and wool, and and ^owe mingled seed. But Deuteronomy. 2^. 9. Thou (the Israel
of God) shall not sow thy Vineyard with diverse seeds: Why? le^t the fruit of
the seed which thou have sown, and the fruit of thy vi^^yard be defiled. The
seed of the Nations was not defiled, though they did sow mingled seed, Ergo,
the Lord puts some peculiar Character on his people, by this, to distinguish
them from other Nations by giving these laws to them, which did not oblige
other Natio^^.

3. We make the Papists and the Heathen that have used white Garments, in the
worship of God* and crossing in the Sacraments, and the like to be our fathers*
where as we are to disclaim them, and not to harden them so, as Israel did
Egypt* who said, Ye cannot serve your God, except in our golden Calves, by
Gods argument Levit. 19, Israel, and Canaan, Protestants, and Idolatrous
Papists have one God, they have the same external statutes,

4. What ^ve^ is a professed way of being infected and sna^ed with the false
religion of those who are at our doors, as Egypt and Canaan was to Israel; and
Papists to us, must be scandalous conformity with them, and this argument is
clear, Levit. 18. 3. Ye shall not do after the doings of the Land of Egypt*
wherein ye^ dwell, nor after the doings of the Land of Canaan, whither I bring
you; Ergo, the danger is the greater, that we dwell beside Idolaters, and the
public practicing of their rites, the more scandalous.

5. We sadden the spirits of the Godly, and lay a stumblingblock before the
blind and weak, in that we build Jeriche again, and with our tongue we lick,
and heal the wound of the daughter of Babel, where as with our teeth we should
byte it.

6. Learned and godly Cartwright, the Author of the book of Discipline;
Amesius and others have cited Councels, as Council. Braca. 73. decreed, That
Christians should not deck their houses with Bay leaves, and green boughs,
that they should not keep the first day of the month, because the Pagans did
so. And another Council, Council. African. c. 27. forbade Christians to
Celebrate Feast^, on the Birth day of the Martyrs, because Pagans did so*
Tertullian would not have Christians to sit after they had prayed* because
Pagans did so.

7. The mark and Character of the Beast is an external discriminating note, of
its own nature, indifferent. Yet to receive it, is a matter of Plague^ and
wrath from God, Rev. 13. Ecclesiast. Po^^ licie, l. 4. p. 138.
15 1^. To these they reply. 1. Those same Ceremon^es* because the sa^^^, which
the heathen used, were not forbidden the Jews. But, th^se things (says M.
Hooker) are not indifferent being used as signs of immederate and hopeless
lamentation, for the dead, and in effect, it is that which Paul says, 1 Thessalonians.
4. ^3. Sorrow not as they do, which have no hope. as Deuteronomy. 14. 1. Ye are the
children of the Lord your God, ye^ shall not cut your selves, nor make you
baldness between^ your eyes for the dead, nor i^ ^^ hence proven (says
Hooker) That God did frame his people of set purpose, unto any utter
dis-si^^ilitude with either Egyptians, Page* 13^.
or other Nations.

Ans. 1. Ceremonies may be either the same. 1. in number. The some Ceremonies
in Idolaters, and in the true Church may be judged the some three ways.
or 2. materially. or 3. formally and Theologically. The first identitie and
samenes is most proper. And whereas Morton, and M. Burges, would insinuate that
God forbade these same Ceremonies in number, it needs no refutation. God
never forbade things, physically, and by way of contradiction, unpossible. The
same murdering of our brother forbidden to Cain, the same in number, is
forbidden in number, and individually to no mortal man, except the Jews had
had the same heads, hair, beards, brows, that the Canaanites had, the same (I
mean) in number, this were to make the laws of God a matter of laughter to
men. 2. Where as Hooker would have God to forbid, not the same Ceremonies
Materially, or an utter dis-similitude, but the same Ceremonies of the Heathen,
with the signification which the Heathen did put on them, contrary to
Scripture, as upon the cutting of their flesh, they did impose this
signification, that they should sorrow for the dead, as those that have no
hope. 1 Thessalonians. 3. we see then 1. all the Ceremonies of the Heathen, as the
cutting of the flesh, the killing of their Children to Molech. So they be
formallized, and charactered with a signification according to the word of God,
shall be lawful. Put then Scripturall and lawful significations, either of
faith in Christ already incarnate, or of Christian conversation, as of moderate
mourning for the dead, such as was in Abraham, who mourned for Sarahs death,
and in our Lord Jesus, who wept for the death of Lazarus; And so the
Sacrificing of Bullocks, Sheep, Rams, Formalists grant Conformity with heathen
and Idolators in Ceremonies clothed with a Scripturall signification.
yea, Circ^^cising and Sacrificing of children to Molech, shall not be
condemned as a compliance, and Symbolizing with the Jews and Idolaters. Nor
can any say that shedding of blood to God, and killing of men must be now
forbidden, I answered before shedding of blood, with this Scripturall and
lawful signification, and as an indifferent means of the worshipping of God, is
no other way forbidden in the first 7. bl^, then because it is not commanded in
Scripture. But this is no forbiding at all of worship, or of new positive
means of worship; So you 1. make it not a part of the word of God, and
necessary worship. 2. So it be materially indifferent, and be instamped with a
lawful and Scripturall signification, as we suppose it to be. 3. Nor does the
Word any where condemn killing of men as a worship, except that i^ commands
it not as a worship, which we say, as it is a breach of the sixth Commandment,
it is forbidden as man-flaughter, but not as unlawful worship. But then how
will Morton and Burges justify. Circumcision which they say is lawful, yet,
so it have not a Jewish intention, nor any necessity or efficacy imposed on
it? it is a degree of murder, and why may not, upon the same ground cutting
the flesh for the dead, launcing of the body with knives, the Popish
selfescourging be lawful? Now the text signifies no allowance at all of the
rounding of the corners of the head, and the cutting of the body* and how shall
Hooker prove that only heathenish and Pagan-rounding of the hair, and cutting
of the flesh, as they betoken mourning in a hopeless manner for the dead were
forbidden, 1 Thessalonians. 3. diverse of the Pagans, amongst whom is Phocyllide^, (...).
Phocillides and many others taught the resurrection of the dead, They might
then sow their land with diverse seeds, cut their flesh for the dead, yea, and
observe times, be dismayed at the signs of the heaven, as the heathen. And
what ever the Pagans did in their worship, they might do so to the Lord their
God, and do all the judgments, ordinances, and laws of Egypt. Canaan,
Turkey, of Rome materially, even to the falling down before Bread, sacrisicing
of Beasts, cutting of the hair, etc. 3. What Hooker means by a
dis-similitude, with the heathen of set purpose, Page 13^.
is easily known. Only in things wicked and unlawful (says he) or
Idolatrous, or against the law of God, we are to be dislike to the heathen,
because it is said, Ye shall do my judgments, for he expressly denies that
there was any danger of infection by reason of nearness to the Egyptians, and
Canaanites, in these indifferent things, or that they were forbidden, because
the Pagans used them, they were unlawful, though the Pagans bad ever used them.

Ans. Tannerus the Jesuit says, tom. 3. in 22. disp 9. de fide, spe. q. 6.
dub. 9. abstinendum est ab omni specie male pr^pter scandalum, ratio, quia
scandalum tali cas^ oritur ex vi actionis ipsius, non aliter f^r^ quam si mala
esset, then though the Nations heathenish rites were not ill, yet being not
necessary to the Jews, and having appearance of ill, in that they are
Characters of the worship of strange Gods, scandal must ref^^e from the using
heathenish Ceremonies, vi actionis, from the nature of the using of them, as if
they were intrin^ecally ill. 2. If it were no more but this, they were so much
the worse, and more scandalous* that beside that they are intrins^cally evil,
yet they are the Statutes of Egypt and Can^a^, and not the Statutes of the
Lord. So either these words must be idly set down, amongst whom ye dwells,
and to which the Lord brings you. Or they must add a degree of wickedness
to the sins that they were the sins of Egypt, and of Canaan, and so they
are forbidden, both as sins, and also for the bare Similitude, as the words
imply, for God will not only have them to walk in right judgments, but also
in his righteous judgments, because ^aith he, ( I am the Lord) and ye shall
not do after such and such a way, because such are the doings and ways of
Egypt, and Canaan. Ergo, Though all were intrinsecally evil, that are
forbidden of this kind, they partake also of a farther degree of moral evil,
in that Egypt, Canaan, and Idolatro^s Papi^^^ do these same things to their
Idols.

Hooker adds. We must be unlike to Rome, not only in Doctrine, page 132. l.
4.
but in Ceremonies and Govern^^^^, and especially Government not commanded in
the Word, for all is Papish* though lawful and agreeable to the word of God,
whatsoever Rome h^^ received without commandment of Gods word.

Ans. The^e is not required properly a conformity in us with Rome in
doctrinals, as if Rome were our Rule, nor is the word of God properly conform
to the Protestant religion, but the Protestant religion must be conform to the
Word. Wh^^nesse is not properly like to Snow or Milk, but Milk or Snow are
like to whiteness. Nor have we properly a (...) with Papists in doctrine, they
are not our pattern, nor we theirs. 2. We do not plead for a Government in
all things to be commanded in the Word, but to be warranted by the Word, either
according to command or promise, or moral practice, for the How the Scripture
is a Rule.
Scripture is our Rule, but 1. not in miraculous things. 2. Not in things
temporary, as Community of Goods. 3. Not in things Literally exponed, as to
cut off our hands and feet. 4. Not in things of Art and Science, as to speak
Latin, to demonstrate conclusions of Astronomy. 5. It is not properly our
Rule in Circumstances, which are but natural conveniences of time, place, and
person, and such like. But it is our Rule 1. in fundamentalls of salvation. 2.
In all morals of both first and second table. 3. In all institutions, and we
conceive the Government Church Government properly an Institution.
of the Church to be a proper institution, to wit, it is a supernatural
ordinance, or help above nature to guide the Church to a supernatural
happiness, nor can the Church be governed by the light of nature, or by the
rules of moral Philosophy, or civil prudence or humane laws, as Cities,
Commonwealths, and Kingdoms, are. 4. It is a rule in Circumstantials of
worship: because some time some thing, as the Lord, day is both worship, and a
Circumstantiall of worship; but not properly a Circumstance, in all these the
Church, as the Church must ^^ir by the Word of God. 3. What ever is in Rome in
physical or natural circumstances is not by us judged Popis^^. But what ever
religious observance Symbolicall sign, new worship, such as ^renging to Bread,
Altars, humane Festivals, Surplice, and the like, that are neither things of
nature, nor 2. things of prudence and civil policy, nor 3. Miraculous things,
nor 4. Things of art and science, nor 5. mere Circumstances, and yet are added
to the worship of God* not necessary in themselves, not warranted by Precept,
practice, or promise in the word of God, we take to be devised by the will of
men, and if by Papists, so much the more unlawful, and may well be termed
Popish, as Popish is contradistinguished from that which is ^ound and warranted
by the Word, and that which is not thus agreeable to the Word, is repugnant
thereunto, and either Popish, or worse, or heathenish.

Hooker. The question is, whether we may follow Rome in 133. l. 4.
orders, Rites and Ceremonies, wherein we do not think them blamable, or else
ought to devise others, and to have no conformity with Rome, no not so much as
in these.

Ans. We never dreamed of such a Question, it is as if one The worship of God
ne^oeth no rel^gious Ceremonies, ^ut what God has himself prescribed.
should have formed such a question to debate with Moses, Whither may we follow
Egypt and Canaan in rounding the corners of our head, and cutting our flesh for
the dea^, in sowing o^r land with mingled seeds, etc. or ought we to devise
others the like, and have no Conformity with them, no not so much as in these?
Now Moses gave never leave to Israel to devise either these, or any other the
like. The Question supposes two things for granted, which are plainly false.
1. That if we may refuse Popish Ceremonies as scandalous, because Papists
devised them, that therefore the worship of God has need of other Symbolical
and religious signs of the like nature, which we ought to devise. But the
worship of God neither needs these nor any Phylactaries of that kind. 2. It
supposes, we do not think the Rites of Rome blamable, this is a begging of
the question, for both we blame them as positive religious Rites beside, and so
contrary to the Word, and because Romish, and so in a high degree scandalous.

Hooker. When Reason evicteth that all such Ceremonies are Hooker, page 134*
not to be abolished they answer, they do only condemn Ceremonies
unprofitable, or Ceremonies in stead whereof as good, or better may be devised,
so they cannot get out of the Briars.

Ans. 1. Who answers so? Hooker should have known, that if the Testament of
Christ warrant not Ceremonies, they and all their kind are unprofitable, and to
be abolished, whither they lay in the womb of the mother of ^ornications, or
be bastards of any other Mother. 2. Yea, we condemn all such Ceremonies,
because unnecessarie, as devised by the will or lust of men, for all necessatie
and usefulness of positive, religious, and teaching observances is from the
will of God. And when he says, we condemn only all unprofitable Ceremonies,
we are not in the briars, for he says, his own Ceremonies are unprofitable
briars, for we condemn them as unprofitable. Chartwright, that godly and
learned witness of Jesus Christ. from whom Hooker would bring this answer,
says, Popish Ceremonies are not to be used to adorn the worship, when as good
or better may be established. But he meaned never that as good positive
Symbolicall rites, without the word of God, can be lawfully devised at all,
this should have been proven from Cartwrights words.

But (says he) we retain these, because we judge them profitable 134. 135.
yea so good, that if we had either simply taken them clean away or else
removed them, so as to place others in their stead, we had done worse. But who
authorized them to sit judges? the burden of proving them inconvenient lies on
them.

Ans. 1. It is a proud Reply. We retain popish Ceremonies, because we judge
them profitable, where as the question is not what the Prelates (who must be
called the Church) judge them to be, but what they are, for it is a far other
question, who should sit Judges (though we can prove Christ never made Prelates
at all, and so he never made them judges) and whether the Ceremonies be
profitable or not? When Prelates say, we retain Popish Ceremonies, because we
judge them profitable, it is to say, We judge Popish Ceremonies to be
profitable, because we judge them profitable. For we say to retain them, is to
pass a law and a judgment that they are profitable. But our* argument is
against their judgeing them to be profitable and against their retaining them.
Might not Pharisees say as much? We retain the precepts and traditions of men
used by our fathers, because, we judge them profitable: and who authorized
Christ and his Disciples to judge the Church? the burden of proving them
inconvenient, lies on the Disciples. Christ said their Ceremonies were the
doctrines of men, and so unlawful: and the like argument bring we against the
Ceremonies, and so they must be unprofitable. 2. If the Church make, or retain
laws beside, and without the Word, they are under the burden of proving them
to be profitable, for they affirm, and* affirmanti incumbit probatio, for they
ought to give another reason, of their laws, then we judge; We affirm, it is
Gods prerogative to say that. 3. If Prelates should do worse to have clean
removed these, or brought others in their place* Then must the Prelaticall
Church be better then the Apostolic Church, for they neither had these, nor
any in their stead, except they make us see that Peter and Paul dispensed the
Word and Sacraments clothed either with lineing Rochets, and crossing the air
with the Thumb, or then they adorned Word and Sacraments, with other the like
mystical Rochets, or some merry toys like crossing the air with the Thumb,
and if not, they did worse then our Prelates, who raise bloody warr^s in three
Kingdoms, for such fooleries, and for an office, which of old, for shame, had
no kindred nor house, but man's law, jus humanum, by their own grant. But that
(says Hooker) wherein the Israelit^^ 138.
might not be like to the Egyptians and Canaanites, was such as peradventure as
had been no whitlesse unlawful, although those Nations had never been, I
would know what one thing was in these nations, and is here forbidden, being
indifferent in it self, yet forbidden only because they used it.

Ans. This is not our argument, I am not to say, the only reason, why the Lord
forbade these rites, was because the Egyptians and Canaanites used them. But it
is enough for our purpose, that God uses this reason, Ye^ shall not do so to
the Lord We need not say that conformi^ie with Idolaters was the only cause,
why God forbade his people, heath^nish rites.
your God. Ye shall not do after the doings of the Land of Egypt, or of the
Canaanites, Deuteronomy. 12. 30. 31. See that then inquire not after their Gods,
saying how did these Nations serve their God? even so will I do likewise,
Levit. 18. 3. 4. This is enough to prove that it is a strong argument, and Gods
argument to prove that a worship, that Heathen uses to their Gods, though in
it own nature indifferent, can not lawfully be given to the Lord, it wanting
all warrant in Gods word, because heathens do so to their Gods and it is
clear to me, Deuteronomy. 12. 2. Ye shall utterly d^stroy all the places wherein the
Nations, which ye possess, served their Gods, upon the high Mountains, and
under every green tree. 3. And you shall break down their Altars, and break
their Pillars, and burn their Groves with fire, and you shall hew down the
Graven Images of their Gods, and destroy the Names of them out of this place.
4. Ye shall not do so to the Lord your God. 5. But unto the place which the
Lord your God shall choose out of all your Tribes, to put his name there, even
unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither shall you come. There is
nothing more indifferent, then the place of worship* yet does the Lord in these
words Ye shall not do so to the Lord your God, forbid to worship God in the
place, where the Canaanites worshipped their Idols. And this proves our point
that Rites used by heathen indifferent in their own nature, as, place,
stone-altars, hills, are not to be used, as positives with a new signification
(as our Ceremonies have) to the Lord our God, because Heathens have done so to
their Idol-Gods. We know the Lord may have, and has other reasons in the
depth of his unsearchable wisdom, why he forbids some things of their own
nature indifferent, then because heathen and wicked men do so, as he forbade
the eating of the tree of knowledge, a thing in it self indifferent, not for
any such conformity with wicked men. And Hooker yields our argument to be
concludent, when he says, Notwithstanding some fault undoubtedly page 139.
thire is in the very resemblance with idolaters. Then notwithstanding all that
Hooker says on the contrary, our argument is good. The rest of this subject
is more fully and learnedly discussed by others, and therefore no more of this.
Peace be on the Israel of God, and to the most high Dominion and Glory.

Amen.
