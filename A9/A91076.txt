A PROPOSAL For Raising one Hundred Thousand Pounds, by laying a Duty upon Hats.
The Equality of this Tax.
THis is an equal Tax, for though a Poor Man pay as great a Tax as a Rich Man, yet
the Rich Man wearing more Hats than the Poor Man, consequently pays the more
Taxes; but, if that satisfy not, then the Tax may be proportioned to the value
of the Hats, viz Bevers, Casters, Carolinas, or Bever-Carolina's and Felts, the
Felts to pay Sixpence and the rest Twelve-pence a Piece.

The Practicableness of it, how and which way this Commodity may be brought to
account, so as to render it capable of being Taxed.
The same Method, in some measure, being taken in this, as in the Excise; for
each Hatter must once a Month (or oftener if there be occasion) make an Entry of
how many of each sort of Hats each of his Men makes every day, the Names of
each Journyman, the particular Number and sorts each Journyman makes to be set
down to his Name, the days of their making none to be likewise set down, the
Entry to be made at the next Excise Office, a Copy of the Entry to be there
taken, one at the Office and the Gauger to sign it, and then to be affixed in
the Shop for the Journymen to referr to. Encouragement to be given to any of
the Servants for discovering false Entries, and Penalties to be laid on them
that make 'em, every Journyman for concealing likewise to incur a Penalty. By
this means every Hatter, if he makes a false Entry, will be in the power of
every one of the said Journymen; and they for their concealment will be in the
power of each other. This, with other Provisions that are made, secures this
Tax from Frauds and concealments (as by the proposal at large will appear) much
better than the Excise either is or can be, and besides there is a Mark or
Stamp provided, if it be necessary, whereby it will not only be under a greater
security than the Excise, but equal with that of the Stamp Office too.

From the necessity of this Commodity, no prejudice to the Hatters Trade; and
from its being General, and proportioned to the value of the Hat, no hardship
upon any one.
This is Tax on things absolutely necessary, and such as must be had, and
therefore no prejudice to Trade; and though it be upon necessaries, yet so Small
is the Consumption among the poorer sort of People that they cannot be thereby
put under any manner of Difficulties, and is so general that there is none who
does not Contribute toward it, and though the Supply is very considerable, yet
so small a matter is it that comes out of each Man's Pocket, that it cannot be
imagined 'twill be a hardship upon any. Hats (as every one knows) are fallen
more than a Third, and notwithstanding, it is not known that the Consumption is
increased by it; therefore, if the sinking of the price has not increased the
consumption, the rising of it again (especially since the Duty proposed will
not raise 'em to what they were before) cannot lessen is; and is so Calculated
that, as by the every Journyman for concealing likewise to incur a Penalty. By
this means every Hatter, if he makes a false Entry, will be in the power of
every one of the said Journymen; and they for their concealment will be in the
power of each other. This, with other Provisions that are made, secures this
Tax from Frauds and concealments (as by the proposal at large will appear) much
better than the Excise either is or can be, and besides there is a Mark or
Stamp provided, if it be necessary, whereby it will not only be under a greater
security than the Excise, but equal with that of the Stamp Office too.

that, as by the Proposal beforementioned will appear, it brings in ready Money.

The Collection without Charge, being to be managed by the Officers of the
Excise.
By how much the charge of one Tax is less than another, by so much in that
respect it has the advantage, and is as it were, so much clear gains to the
Government. Now the charge of the Excise, it seems, comes to about a Tenth of
the Income, and this being to be annexed to the Excise-Office may be easily
managed by their Officers, so that this may be brought in for nothing, or for a
very small matter at most. C^omparing this advantage therefore with the Excise,
together with the security of this Tax beyond what that is capable of, and, if
a Mark shall be thought necessary, equal to that of the Stamp-Office too, it
will be found there will be so much saved by it, which together with its other
advantages will be no small Recommendation of it. The Customs are not brought
in neitherunder a very great charge; nay, the very Land Tax amounts to a
Twenty-Third.

From its creating no new Officers and its being Collectable with little or 'no
charge, is is free from all ill Consequeces, it is therefore NO EXCISE.
And though it be proposed to be under the managery of the Excise, yet is it not
an Excise it self, that is to say, it is not attended with the same ill
consequences; because it creates no new Offices or Officers, and is Collectable
with little or no charge. For this reason therefore, and because it is a Tax
equal in it self, certain to be depended upon, to be had without Frauds or
Concealments, that does not Prejudice Trade in general, or the Hat-makers in
particular; it is Humbly proposed to the Consideration of this Honorable House.
