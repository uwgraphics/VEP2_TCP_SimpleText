A SONG.
^ As I walked by an Hos -- pi -- tal, I heard an old Woman cry; If Jove would
be so kind to^ me once more before I dye, as let me to enjoy the Bliss which
Nature has designed:^ But alas! who will the Cause redress, of an old Woman
poor and blind.

II.
Now I have been a Widow
These five and forty years,
Both night and day I beg and pray,
With many a bitter tear,
That Jove would be but pleased to grant,
What Nature has designed
To cheer the Hearts of those in want,
As old Women poor and blind.
III.
But why should I torment my self,
For what I cannot gain,
Since day nor night brings no delight.
But misery and pain:
Or why should I rejected be,
Since none will be so kind
As for to do a courtesy
For an old Woman poor and blind.
IV.
A young man hearing her complain,
Returned this reply,
What will you give me, good Woman, said he,
And I Will smuggle you handsomely;
In troth kind Sir, nothing I have
That I will thee deny,
If thou will be but pleased to grant
To do me this courtesy.
V.
Oh here is forty Shillings,
That Is all the Money I have,
I am but poor, and have no more,
To carry me to my Grave;
And if thou will take it in part
Of being to me kind,
The Gods above be thy reward,
For an old Woman poor and blind.
