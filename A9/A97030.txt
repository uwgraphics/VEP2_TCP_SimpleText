MY LORDS,
I Am commanded by the House of Commons, to present you with these Articles
against M. Justice Crawley, which (...) your Lordships shall have been ^d to
hear read I shall take leave (according to custom) ^o say something of what I
have coll^^^ed from the sense of that House concerning the crimes therein
contained.

Here the charge was read containing his extrajudi iall opinions subscribed,
and judgment given for Ship Money, and afterward a declaration in his charge
at an Assize, that Ship-mony was so inhaerent a right in the Crown, that it
would not be in the power of a Parliament to take it away. MY LORDS, Not only
my wants but my affections render me less fit for this employment: for though
it has not been my happiness to have the Law a part of my breeding, there is
no man honors that profession more, or has a greater reverence toward the
grave Judges the Oracles thereof. Out of Parliament all our Courts of Justice
are governed or directed by them, and when a Parliament is called, if your
Lordships were not assisted by them, and the House of Commons by other
Gentlemen of that Robe, experience tells us it might run a hazard of being
styled Parlamentum indoctorum. But as all professions are obnoxious to the
malice of the professors, and by them most easily betrayed, so (my Lords)
these Articles have told you how these brothers of the Coyfeare become fratres
in malo; how these sons of the Law have torn out the bowels of their
mother: But this Judge (whose charge you last heard) in one expression of his
excells no less his Fellows, then they have done the worst of their
predecessors, in this conspiracy against the Commonwealth. Of the Judgment
for Shipmoney, and those extrajudiciall opinions preceding the same (wherein
they are jointly concerned) you have already heard; how unjust and pernicious a
proceeding that was in so public a Cause, has been sufficiently expressed to
your Lordships: But this man, adding despair to our misery, tells us from the
Bench, that Ship Money was a Right so inhaerent in the Crown, that it would
not be in the power of an Act of Parliament to take it away. Herein (my Lords)
he did not only give as deep a wound to the Commonwealth as any of the rest,
but dipped his dart in such a poison, that so far as in him lay it might never
receive a cure. As by those abortive opinions subscribing to the subversion of
our propriety, before he heard what could be said for it, he prevented his
own, so by this declaration of his he endeavors to prevent the Judgment of
your Lordships too, and to confine the power of a Parliament, the only place
where this mischief might be redrest: Sure he is more wise and learned, then
to believe himself in this opinion, or not to know how ridiculous it would
appear to a Parliament, and how dangerous to himself, and therefore no doubt
but by saying no Parliament could abolish this Judgment, his meaning was that
this Judgment had abolish't Parliaments.

This imposition of Ship Money springing from a pretended necessity, was it not
enough that it was now grown annual, but he must intayle it upon the State for
ever, at once making necessity in haerent to the Crown, and slavery to the
Subject? N^cessity, which dissolving all Law is so much more prejudicial to
his Majesty then to any of us, by how much the Law has invested his Royal
State with a greater power, and ampler fortune, for so undoubted a truth it has
ever been, that Kings as well as Subjects are involved in the confusion which
necessity produces, that the Heathen thought their gods also obliged by the
same, Pareamus necessitati quam nec homines nec dii superant: This Judge then
having in his charge at the Assize declared the dissolution of the Law by this
suppos^d necessity, with what conscience could he at the same Assize proceed
to condemn and punish men, unless perhaps he meant the Law was still in
force for our destruction, and not for our preservation, that it should have
power to kill, but none to protect us; a thing no less horrid then if the
Sun should burn without lighting us, or the earth serve only to bury and not
to feed and nourish us. But (my Lords) to demonstrate that this was a
supposititious imposed necessity, and such as they could remove when they
pleased, at the last Convention in Parliament a price was set upon it, for
twelve Subsidies you shall reverse this Sentence: It may be said that so much
money would have removed the present necessity, but here was a Rate set upon
future necessity, For twelve Subsidies you shall never suffer necessity again,
you shall for ever abolish that judgment; Here this mystery is revealed, this
visour of necessity is pull^d off, and now it appears that this Parliament of
Judges had very frankly and bountifully presented his Majesty with twelve
Subsidies to be leavied on your Lordships, and the Commons: Certainly there is
no privilege which more properly belongs to a Parliament, then to open the
purse of the Subject, and yet these Judges, who are neither capable of sitting
among us in the house of Commons, nor with your Lordships, otherwise then as
your assistants, have not only assumed to themselves this privilege of
Parliament, but presumed at once to make a present to the Crown of all that
either your Lordships or the Commons of England do, or shall hereafter
possess.

And because this man has had the boldness to put the power of Parliament in
balance with the opinion of the Judges, I shall entreat your Lordships to
observe by way of comparison the solemn and safe proceeding of the one, with
the precipitate dispatch of the other: In Parliament (as your Lordships know
well) no new Law can pass, or old be abrogated, till it has been thrice read
with your Lordships, thrice in the Commons House, and then it receives the
Royal Assent, so that it is like gold 7 times purified; whereas these Judges by
this one resolution of theirs would persuade his Majesty, that by naming
necessity he might at once dissolve (at least suspend) the great Charter 32
times confirmed by his Royal Progenitors, the petition of Right, and all
other Laws provided for the maintenance of the Right and propriety of the
Subject; a strange force (my Lords) in the sound of this word necessity, that
like a Charm it should silence the Laws, while we are dispoyl'd of all we
have, for that but a part of our goods was taken is owing to the grace and
goodness of the King, for so much as concerns these Judges, we have no more
left then they perhaps may deserve to have, when your Lordships shall have
passed Judgment upon them: This for the neglect of their Oaths, and betraying
that public trust, which for the conservation of our Laws was reposed in
them.

Now for the cruelty and unmercifulness of this judgment, you may please to
remember that in the old Law they were forbid to sees a Kid in his mothers
milk, of which the received interpretation is, that we should not use that to
the destruction of any creature which was intended for its preservation; Now
(my Lords) God and Nature has given us the Sea as our best Guard against our
Enemies, and our ships as our greatest glory above other Nations, and how
barbarously would these men have let in the sea upon us, at once to wash away
our Liberties, and to overwhelm, if not our Land, all the propriety we have
therein, making the supply of our Navy, apretence for the ruin of our Nation;
for observe I beseech you the fruit and consequence of this judgment, how this
money has prosper'd, how contrary an effect it has had to the end for which
they pretended to take it: On every County a ship is annually imposed, and who
would not expect, but our seas by this time should be covered with the number
of our ships? Alas (my Lords) the daily Complaints of the decay of our Navy
tell us how ill ship money has maintained the Sovereignty of the sea; and by
the many petitions which we receive from the wives of those miserable Captives
at Algier (being between 4 and 5 thousand of our Countrymen) it does too
evidently appear that to make us slaves at home, is not the way to keep us
from being made slaves abroad; so far has this judgment bin from relieving
the present or preventing the future necessity, that as it changed our real
propriety into the shadow of a propriety, so of a feigned it has made a Real
necessity.

A little before the approach of the Gauls to Rome, while the Romans had yet
no apprehension of that danger, there was heard a voice in the Air, louder
then ordinary, The Gauls are come, which voice after they had sacked the
City, and besieged the Capitol, was held so ominous, that Livie relates it as
a Prodigy; This Anticipation of necessity seems to have been no less ominous
to us; These Judges like ill boading birds have called necessity upon the State
in a time when I dare say they thought themselves in greatest security; but if
it seem superstitious to take this as an Omen, sure I am we may look on it
as a cause of the unfeigned necessity we now suffer, for what regret and
discontent had this judgment bred among us? And as when the noise and tumult
in a private house grows so loud as to be heard into the streets, it calls in
the next dwellers either kindly to appease, or to make their own use of the
domestic strife; so in all likelihood our known discontents at home have
been a concurrent cause to invite our Neighbors to visit us so much to the
expense and trouble of both these Kingdoms.

And here, my Lords, I cannot but take notice of the most sad effect of this
oppression, the ill influence it has had upon the ancient reputation and valor
of the English Nation and no wonder, for if it be true that oppression makes a
wise man mad, it may well suspend the courage of the valiant: The same happened
to the Romans when for renown in Arms they most excelled the rest of the
world; the story is butshort, 'twas in the time of the Decemviri (and I think
the thief-troublers of our State may make up that number,) The Decemviri, my
Lords, Livie lib. 5.
had subverted the Laws, suspended the Courts of Justice; and (which was the
greatest grievance both to the Nobility and people) had for some years omitted
to assemble the Senate, which was their Parliament; This says the Historian
did not only deject the Romans, and make them despair of their Liberty, but
caused them to be less valued by their Neighbors: The Sabines take the
advantage and invade them; and now the Decemviri are forced to call the long
desired Senate, whereof the people were so glad, that Hostibus belloque gratiam
habuerunt: This Assembly breaks up in discontent, nevertheless the war
proceeds; Forces are raised, led by some of the Decemviri, and with the Sabines
they meet in the Field; I know your Lordships expect the event; My Authors
words of his Countrymen are these, Ne quid ductu aut auspicio Decemvirorum
prospere gereretur, vinci se patiebantur, They chose rather to suffer a present
diminution of their Honor, then by victory to confirm the tyranny of their
new Masters: At their return from this unfortunate expedition, after some
distempers and expostulations of the people, an other Senate, that is a second
Parliament, is called, and there the Decemviri are questioned, deprived of
their Authority, imprisoned, banished, and some lose their lives; and soon
after this vindication of their Liberties, the Romans by their better success
made it appear to the world, that liberty and courage dwell always in the
same breast, and are never to be divorced. No doubt, my Lords, but your Justice
shall have the like effect upon this dispirited people; it is not the
restitution of our ancient Laws alone, but the restoration of our ancient
courage which is expected from your Lordships: I need not say any thing to move
your just indignation that this man should so cheaply give away that which your
noble Ancestors with so much courage and industry had so long maintained: you
have often been told how careful they were, though with the hazard of their
lives and fortunes, to derive those Rights and Liberties as entire to posterity
as they received them from their Fathers; what they did with labor you may do
with ease, what they did with danger you may do securely, the foundation of
our Laws is not shaken with the Engine of War, they are only blasted with
the breath of these men, and by your breath may be restored.

What Iudgemenrs your Predecessors have given, and what punishments their
Predecessors have suffered for offenses of this nature; your Lordships have
already been so well informed, that I shall not trouble you with a repetition
of those precedents: Only (my Lords) something I shall take leave to observe
of the person with whose charge I have presented you, that you may the less
doubt of the wilfulness of his offense.

His education in the Inns of Court, his constant practice as a Counselor,
and his experience as a Judge (confidered with the mischief he has done) makes
it appear that this Progress of his through the Law, has been like that of a
diligent Spy through a Country into which he meant to conduct an enemy.

To let you see he did not offend for company, there is one crime so peculiar
to himself, and of such malignity, that it makes him at once incapable of your
Lordships favor, and his own subsistence incompatible with the right and
propriety of the Subject: for if you leave him in a capacity of interpreting
the Laws, has he not already declared his opinion, That your votes and
resolutions against Ship Money are void, and that it is not in the power of a
Parliament to abolish that Judgment? To him, my Lords, that has thus played
with the power of Parliament, we may well apply what was once said to the Goat
browsing on the Vine, Rode, caper, vitem, tamen hinc cum stabis ad aras In Tua
quod fundi cornua possit, erit:

He has cropped and infringed the privileges of a banished Parliament, but now
it is returned he may find it has power enough to make a Sacrifice of him, to
the better establishment of our Laws; and in truth what other satisfaction can
he make his injured Country, then to confirm by his example those Rights and
Liberties which he had ruined by his opinion?

For the proofs, my Lords, they are so manifest, that they will give you
little trouble in the disquisition; his crimes are already upon Record, the
Delinquent and the Witness is the same; having from several Seats of
Judicature proclaimed himself an Enemy to our Laws and Nation, Ex ore suo
judicabitur. To which purpose I am commanded by the Kinghts, Citizens, and
Burgesses of the House of Commons, to desire your Lordships that as speedy a
proceeding may be had against Mr. Justice Crawley as the course of Parliaments
will permit.

FINIS.
