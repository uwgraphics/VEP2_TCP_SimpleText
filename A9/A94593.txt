To the Right Honorable, Francis Lord Willoughby, Lord Lieutenant of the
County of Lincoln, and Lincolneshiere.
The Declaration and Protestation of diverse of the Knights, Gentry, Freeholders
and others of the foresaid Counties, whose names are subscribed.
Shows,
THat considering the many unhappy Distractions lately grown in Church and
Commonwealth, through the malicious practice of a malignant Party, laboring
to breed Jealousies betwixt the King and His People, We are enforced to
express in this our humble Declaration, our desires and resolutions to spend
our lives and estates in the defense of His Majesty's Person, The true
Protestant Religion, the Peace of the Realm, the maintenance of the Rights and
Privileges of Parliament, the Laws of the Land, and the lawful Liberties of
the Subjects, according to our late Protestation, against all such as shall
attempt to separate His Majesty from His great and faithful Council of
Parliament, and by that means to alienate His Majesty's affection from His
loyal Subjects: And this our Declaration we humbly desire your Lordship to
represent from us to the High and Honorable Court of Parliament.

Subscribed with many thousand hands.
Die Lunae 18. Julij, 1642.
Ordered by the Commons assembled in Parliament, to be forthwith Printed.
