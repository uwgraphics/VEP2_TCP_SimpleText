The Oath taken by the Seamen of the revolted Ships.
IN pursuance of the Covenant I have already taken, I A. B. do in the presence
of Almighty God the Searcher of all hearts, solemnly vow and protest, That in
the first place I shall heartily endeavor the freedom and Restoration of my
Sovereign Lord King Charles to all his full and just Rights: and will behave my
self faithfully in the service of His Highness the Prince of Wales. Next I do
vow all true obedience to my Lord High Admiral the Duke of York, and that I
will conform my self cheerfully to all his Highness lawful Commands which
shall be for the service of his Royal Father: That I will hold no correspondence
with the Enemy, but shall faithfully discover all Designs that I can come to
the knowledge of, of that nature; and shall endeavor with the utmost hazard
of my life to defend and protect his Highness Person from all danger; nor will
ever give consent to deliver him up without the King his Royal Father's
command, or his own consent. And as I shall be faithful and just in the
performance of all this; so help me God, and the contents of this Book.
