THE WHITBY CASE.
WHITBY, in the North Riding of the County of York, is a Seaport, commodiously
Situated near the Midway between Humber, and the River of Tine; in which
distance, being One hundred Miles, there is not so safe and convenient a
Harbor, were the Peers Repaired; it being capable of Harboring above Five
hundred Sale of Ships at once: And whereas it is now much Choked up with
Sands, were the Peers Repaired, the forceable Floods of the River Esk, coming
from the Hills about, would keep it open, so as to be of great Service and
Benefit to the Northern Navigation, both from Storms and Enemies, the
Inhabitants of that Town being as forward as any to assist in all Cases of
Danger: And is now, one of the principal Nursery of Seamen and Fishermen on
these Coasts, having at this time, One hundred and twenty Sail of Ships and
Vessels, of Three hundred and fifty Tuns Burden, and downward: Yet so it is,
that they having no Fund, nor are of Ability to Repair the said Peers of
themselves, do therefore Humbly beg of this present Parliament, to grant them
such Relief as in their Wisdoms shall seem meet.
