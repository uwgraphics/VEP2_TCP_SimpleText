Enchiridium Epigrammatum: AN EPITOME Of Essais.

Eloquium AD Enchiridium.
CArmina dum recinis veluti Philomela sonora,
Parve Liber; Vox es praetereaque nihil.
Vade pusille Liber, nee inania scommata Vulgi
Respice: censurae sors tibi certamanet.
While like shril Nightingal thou Rythms do sing,
Small Book; thou art a Voice, and else Nothing.
Go forth Babe Book, vain vulgar scoffs defy:
Sharp censure is thy certain destiny.

Ad Lectores omnifarios: To al sorts of Surveiors.
THis Toy is a mere Table of 676 Essais on several Subjects: which are more
copiously contained in two Folio Tomes intended for the Press, with larger or
lesser Explications on each: But my hand is illegible and much interlined; so
they must al be new transcribed, which will take up one years time at least, if
God Grant life so long. In which regard, to satisfy many Men's earnest
expectations, I have published hand in hand eght Theological Theorems, and two
subnected Essais explicated in quarto, which he that lists may peruse.

Virgil is said to play the part of a Shepherd in his Eclogs, a Farmer in his
Georgics, and a Warrier in his Aeneids.: So I presuming to print three
Pamphlets, act the Person of a Poetaster in this first, to vent the dregs of
Youthly delights: being a bare bag of bones or Sceleton (like a Nutshel without
kernel) denuded of skin, flesh, ligaments, and other lineaments: Of a
Theologist in the next (which is a rich casknet of sublime Speculations) to jet
like a long eard Animal in a Lions skin: being peeced out with collections
taken from deep Divines. And of a general Sciolist or Smatterer in the last
(which shall follow so soon as Lucina can bring it to birth) to venditat sundry
sorts of liberal literature in shreds, being the rotten withered fruits of
Academic studies, now almost antiquated or out of date by long desuetud.

To tell truth this pety pocket piece (first entitled memorativ Verses) is
printed a part in policy, purposly to bestow on Friends; being but a Catalog of
Contents belonging to the larger Volume; which is grown to so big a bulk beyond
du bounds, as will mount to a far higher valu (that every one may have one) then
my ruined Fortune can bear; hoping that al such as know my poverty will accept
this small mite in lieu of a richer present. My memory cannot reach to remember
every Patient or Party of my ancient acquaintance, to whom I am engaged in
amity or courtesy: but my desire is to gratisy each, and send 400. Copies (some
bound, some unbound) to dispers in free gift (without any fee to sender or
bri^ger) that none may be forgotten. Those that are omitted, may repair to Mr.
Hooper Apothecary in Exceter near S. Martins Lane; who will deliver one gratis
to any man of quality my familiar Friend.

Nemo erit e priscis mihi non donatus amicis,
Quin unum excipiet pro meo amore Librum
For lovs sake none of ancient Friends shall be,
But he one Book shall have for boon from me.
The Essais or Epigrams run in one tenor throughout: for though the matter be
diverse, yet the method or manner (mostly Distichs, which is the pithiest parcel
of Poetry, comprising the full sens in two Verses) is uniform: know one, know
al. Al Latin Verses whether new coined or borrowed are fresh translated near the
letter, which some nasut Critics censure as too Pedantic; when their Libertin
guise is in very Antic disguise: who render their own sens so far varying from
the Authors meaning, as he will scars own it: but the english Versions flowed
forth ex tempore.

Sponte sua carmen numeros veniebat ad aptos: Ovid.

Et quod tentabam scribere Versus erat.
Metres of free accord to fit feet came:
And what I tried to write, in Verse did frame.
For the Latin have al just feet, but some English one too many; which may be
clipped off by corrept pronouncing. Al proper names (Adam, Abel) being squared
by no rule, are made long or short by Poetical liberty: but those with
Dipthongs, duple Consonants, or the like (Caesar, Xerxes, Tullius) are long by
Nature or Position: Yet in most Roman names (Roma, Romulus) I observe custom and
authority so curiously as can be, which may be a good Lesson for Grammar Scholars
to do the like. If any professed Poet shall sift the whole Pile, he will find some
such Crabtree pieces of knotty Subjects, as may happily gal his hand to cleav
them, or trouble his head-peece to reduce them into smooth Metres: therefore no
marvel if many of the Puzlers here be not so well planed, polished, or perfected
as is expected, or as they should be.

Carbasa siste, Ratis: mihi Cynthia vellicat aures
Barque, stop thy sails: Cynthia bids stay,
Lest she should sole my Ears away.
Nor will I set a large Porch before a little Pile, lest the house run out at door.

Adieu.

Scribere scribendo disces, promptu^ efficit usus:
Sic cudendo itidem cudere quisque potest.
By writing or Printing one shall learn to write
And likewise Print: use makes men prompt to indite.

THe Errats escaped are not many, nor much material; being mostly literal, not
verbal nor real to mar the sens: which every man may easily emend as they
occur: therefore such slight sl^ps are let pass without any animadversion. Only
one Latin title is casualy omitted (Intellectus and voluntas, Cl. 1. Theol.
Epig. 41. p. 12.) which is inserted in the Table, and space sufficient left in
the Enchiridion to interpose it, if any one list. The Author has suddenly set
forth a Compend of Chronography (price at Press 3 d.) worth perusing, intended
for a previous Precognit to the two ensuing Tomes.

Yet in this Book few visible remain.

Tunc pepegit Fallax, sumpsit and inde Togam.
Tandem non licuit nisi Subscribentibus: atque
Subscripsit Fallax, sumpsit and inde Togam.
Credo, si Demon quidquam praescripserit, illud
Perficeret Fallax, indueretque Togam.
None could unless first sworn, plead public Cause:
Fallax did swear and took his Gown of Laws.
Next none might plead, til sacred Covenant pacted:
Fallax took that, and in his Gown then acted.
At length none sav Subscribers durst presume:
Fallax subscribed, and did his Gown resume.
I deem, if ought the Devil should impose;
Fallax would do 't and his Gown new compose.

Fundit inexhausti germina lauta soli:
Et Pater Oceanus Tamisino gurgite mistus,
Convebit immensas totius Orbis opes.
Singula contemplare animo, diligensque tuere:
Aut Orbem, aut Orbis dixeris esse caput.

Regno sort deest, haec caput esse queat.

Eliquat hic Ferrum, Aes, Aurum hic quoque ductile fundit
Quos non Auri illex conciet umbra animos?
She Natures wonders set on high Rock views;
Or does them prudently to her own transfuse.

Cujus ab auspiciis unita Brytannia tandem,
Excelsum tollit liberain Astra caput.
In Scotlands utmost bound, where Saxons broil
Did rest, as of both Nations equal toil

Gaudia semper erant, spes semper mixta timori.
Si modo Victor eras, ad crastina bella pavebas:
Si modo Victus eras, ad crastina bella parabas.
Cui vestes sudore jugi, cui sica cruore
Tincta jugi, quantum sit onus regnare, probarunt.

If Victor now, thou dreadedst n^xt dais rue:
If vanquished now, next thou did wars renew.
Whose garment's staind with sweat, whose sword with blood;
Showed what toil it is to reign, tho 't seem so good.
Though worn with wars, from fight he would not ceas;
Yet perished not by sword, but died in peace.
Now after all the toils of life and reign,
Let him with Christ in true rest still remain.

Propositis Causae rationibus, alter utrinque
Concurrere pares, and cecidere pares.
Quod fuit in votis, Frater capit alter utrumque:
Quod fuit in fatis, perdit uterque fidem.

Et tamen alteruter se superasse dole^?

What Fate ordaind, each his first Faith forsakes.

And flying Conqu'rors the Camp of vanquishd sought
What war is this, where Conquerors both are glad;
Yet each that he did overcom, is fad?

Reader, thou have here sundry subjects included
In one Book; which through diverse are diffused.

valleys, and other pleasing Objects presented to public view in a small map or
model: which thou may pass by cursorily, without spending time or travel in
any curious survey: but it shall be by Grace of God more amply and accuratly
extended or exhibited in particular Maps, to take up thy serious thoughts; so
soon as they can be well transcribed by this tired hand, and finished fitting
for the tedious Press.

Ad Lectores omnigenos ultimum vale.
Scriptori sat far dapes, and ponere seeds:
Si placet, Pro edite
este domi: sin minus, ite for as.
Writers Can but bring Cates, and set forth stools:
If ye like, eat: if not, you are al -- welcome.
A final farewell to al sorts of Readers.
Let none carp, cavil, or complain that I close up this last Distich in Prose,
contrary to common custom: since happily Prose will best pleas palats already tired
with harsh Rythms, to close up queasy Stomachs ready to surfeit with musty
Metres. Indeed necessity enforced it, since I wanted a word to my mind of like
cadence with stools: which if any can supply, there is space left to insert it.
Nor can the phrase (ite for as) be better rendered then you are welcome: which men
usualy giv their Friends or Guests at doors, when they take their last leaves
for that Visit one of another.

Sic prodesse magis quam delectare cupisco.
Thus to do good I more desire,
Then with delight men's minds to inspire.

Quaestio. Tell, where lived God when naught beside him was?
Responsio. There, where now, in himself: who brought al to pass.
EPIG. XXXIX. Dei Opus ante creationem Mundi.
Ignotus.
The 4 Distichs framed in Answer to an Atheistic Question, what God did, before
he created the Univers?

Dum Populum Lybicis docet Augustinus in Oris,
Esse probans manibus cuncta creata Dei:
Impius assurgit, verbisque procacibus Afer
Ergo Opifex rerum quid facicbat, ait.
Et quibus intentus fallebat tempora curis;
Mundus adhunc nondum cum fabrifactus erat?
Praesul adhaec Lybicus, fabrifecit Tartara, dixit
His quos scrutari talia mente juvat.
When Austin People taught in Lybic Land,
Proving al things were wrought by Gods high hand:
A wicked Moor stepped up, and sawcily
Asked, What the Maket did from al Eternity?
And with what works he did the time beguile,
When as the World was not yet framed the while?
The Lybic Prelat said, He made Hell below
For busy brains which such things seek to know.

And still beware thy time be not il spent.
Invigilate Libris: quid non solertia vincit:
Namque labor Deus Mortalibus omnia vendit.
Apply your Books: what cannot study gain?
For Men from God shall buy al things by pain.
God injoind Man to get his living with the sweat of his brows: but Scholars

EPIG. XLII. Carmina diversimoda.
Ignotus.

Which so in Grammar Schools are diversely styled.
Golden contain two Adjectiv Epithets, and two Substantivs; with a Verb
copulativ in midst of al: as Aurea purpuream Connectit sibula vestem. Silvern
consist of three Dactyls and three Spondees alternatly placed one after
another: as Si mea cum vestris valuissent vota, Pelasgi: but this kind is
reputed more authentic or artificial, if there be just six words like the
former, conjoind one with another in each foot: as, Scilicet Argentum reputatur
vilius Auro

Anonymus.
The 2 Principal Laws, which Nature writes in Men's hearts: yet too many blot

Ice in Loving.

Me nive candenti petiit modo Julia: rebar
Igne carere nivem; nix tamen ignis erat.
Quid nive frigidus? nostrum tamen urere pectus
Nix potuit manibus, Julia missa tuis.
Quis locus infidiis dabitur mihi tutus amoris,
Frigore concreta si latet ignis aqua?
Julia sola potes nostras compescere flammas:
Non nive, nec glacie; sed potes igne pari.
Julia with burning Snow my breast once hurted:
I thought Snow had no Fire, but Fire there lurked.
What then Snow colder? yet Snow as Fiery brand
My breast could burn cast, Julia, by thy hand.
What place shall then from Lovs snares me safe hold,
If Fire in Water lies congeld with cold?
You Julia, soly can my Flames assuage;
Not with Snow, nor Ice; but with like Fires rage.
EPIG. XLVIII. Vunguentum Anserinum.
Guainerius.
The 8 material Ingredients, which concur to confect Goos-Ointment, put in
equal weight each.

Anser sumatur, veteranus qui videatur:
Mox deplumetur, penetralibus exoneretur:
Trita caro tota; triti mox pelle remota;
Intus ponantur, quae subterius numerantur.
Vnctum Porcinum, Thus, Ceram, Sanguinem Ovinu^,
Pondere pone aequo: Sal, Mel, Faba, sitque Siligo.
Post haec assetur; tamen assus non comedetur:
Vas suppanatur, sic ut liquor accipiatur.
Quo membris unctis, Artbritis solvitur Omnis:
Certe hoc Vnguentum praestat super omne Talentum.
Take an old Goos: pu^ him: his Guts draw clear:
Bruis him: skin him: put in these things namd here.

Foemineum servile Genus, crudele, superbum;
Lege, modo, ratione vacat: confinia recti
Negligit, extremis gaudet, facit omnia voto
Praecipiti, vel lenta jacet, vel concita currit.
Foemina semper hyems atque intractabile f^igus;
Aut Canis ardentes contristat sydere terras:
Temperiem nunquam, nunquam mediocria curat:
Vel te ardenter amat, vel te capitaliter odit.
Si gravis est, moeret torvo nimis hernica vultu:
Si stuedeat comis fieri, gravitate remissa
Fit levis: erumpit blando lascivia risu;
Et lepor in molli radiat meretricius ore.
Flet, ridet, sapit, insanit, formidat and audet:
Vult, non vult, secumque sibi contraria pugnat.
Mobilis, inconstans, vaga, garrula, vana, bilinguis,
Imperiosa, minax, indigna abunda, cruenta,
Improba, avara, rapax, querula, invida, credula, mendax,
Impatiens, onerosa, bibax, temeraria, mordax,
Ambitiosa, levis; Maga, Lena, superstitiosa,
Desidiosa, vorax, ganeae, studiosa, palatum
Docta, salax, petulans, and dedita mollitiei,
Dedita blanditiis, curandae dedita formae:
Irae odiique tenax, in idonea tempora differt
Ulciscendi animos, insida, ingrata, masigna,
Impetuosa, audax, fera, litigiosa, rebellis;
Exprobrat, excusa^ tragica sua crimina Voce:
Murmurat, accendit rixas, nil foedera pendit.
Ridet amicitias, curat sua commoda tantum,
Ludit, adulatur, defert, sale mordet amaro;
Seminat in vulgus nugas, auditaque lingua
Auget, and ex humili tumulo producit Olympum.
Dissimulat, simulat, doctissima fingere Causas,
Ordirique dolos, fraud que accomodat ora,
Ora omnes facili casus imitantia motu.
Non potes insidias evadere, non potes astum
Vincere tantae Arts, solercia tanta nocendi:
Et quanquam videaes oculis praesentibus, audet
Excusare nefas: potis est eludere sensus
Sedulitate animi: nibil est quod credere possis;
Et nihil est quod non, si vult, te parcere coget.
His facient exempla fidem: quae crimina non sunt
Foeminea tentata manu? dedit hostibus Arcem
Decepta ornatu brach Tarpeia sinist^i:
Saeviit in Natos manibus Medea cruentis:
Tyndaris Aegeas oneravit navibus undas:
Scylla hostem sequitur, Patri surata Capillum:
Fratrem Biblis amat: subicit se Myrrha Parenti:
Conc^bitu Nati longaeva Semiram is ardet:
Causa necis Vati conjux fuit Amphiarao:
Occidere viros nocturnis Belides armis:
Orphea membratim Cicones secuere P^ctam:
Cognita luxuriae petulantia Pasiphaeae:
Phaedra pudicitiam contra crudeliter ausa est:
Decepit Judaea Virum Rebecca, suamque

Porrigit Alcidae conjux fatale Venenum:
Decipi^ Hippodame Patrem: Lavinia Troas
Implicat ancipiti bello: Bryseis Achillem
Depulite Castris: demens Chryseide factus
Fulminat Atrides, and sentit Apollinis iras:
Eva genus nostrum foelicibus ^xpulis arvis.
Credit Pastores, per rustica Numina juro;
Pascua si Gregibus vestris innoxia vultis,
Si vobis Ovium cura est, si denique vobis
Grata quies, pax, vita; leves prohibete Puellas,
Pellanturque procul vestris ab Ovilibus omnes:
Thestilys, and Phyllis, Galataea, Neaera, Lycori^.
Dicite, quae tristim Mulier descendit ad Orcum
Et rediit? potuit si non malesana fuisset,
Eurydice revehi per quas descender at umbras
Rapta sequi renuit fessam Proserpina Matrem.
At pius Aeneas redit, remeavit and Orpheus,
Maximus Alcides, and Theseus, and duo Fratres;
Unus equis, alter pugnis bonus atque palestra:
Et noster Deus, unde Salus and Vita resurgit.
Haec sunt, Pastores, haec sunt mysteria nobis
Advertanda: animi fugiunt obsc^^a Vir^les;
Foemineas loca delectant infamia mentes.
Vt semel in scopulos vento contortus and unda,
Nauta sit incautis monstrare pericula Nautis:
Sic senior longo factus prudentior usu,
Praeteritos meminit casus, aperitque futuri
Temporis eventus, vitaeque pericula monstrat.
Si fugiant Aquilam Fulicae, si retia Cervi,
Si Agna Lupum, si Dama Ca^em: muliebira cur non
Blandimenta fugis tantum tibi noxia, Pastor?
Et in eis pietas Crocodili, astutia Hyaenae:
Cum flet and appellat te blandius, insidiatur.
Foemineos, Pastor, fugito (sunt retia) vultus:
Non animis, non virtuti, non viribus ullis
Fidito: non Clypeo cujus munimine Perseus
Vidit saxifica coluhros impune Medusae.
Monstra peremerunt multi, domuere Gigantes,
Evertere urbes, legem imposuere marinis
Fluctibus, impetui fluviorum, and montibus aspris;
Sacra coronarunt multos cartamina: sed qui
Cuncta subegerunt, sunt a muliere subacti.
Rex qui Pastor erat, funda spolioque Leonis
Inclytus; and Natus qui Templa Sionia fecit,
Primus and excellens invicto robore Samson,
Foemineum subiere jugum: minus officit ignis,
Saxa minus, rhomphaea minus, minus hasta, minus mors.
Nec formae contenta suae splendore, decorum
Auget mill modis mulier: frontem ligat auro,
Purpurat art genas, and collocat art capillos:
Art regit gressus, and lumina temperat art.
Currit, ut in latebras ludens perducat Amantem:
Vult dare, sed cupiens simplex and honesta videri;
Denegat, and pugnat, sed vult super omnia vinci.
Foemina Caeciaco (res mira) si^illima vento est,
Qui trahit, expellens mendaci nubila flatu.
Quisquis es (expertus moneo) tentare recusa
Dum licet, haec fragilis quot habet sastidia Sexus.
Immundum Natura animal, sed quaeritur Art
Mundities: id luce opus est, ea somnia nocte.
Deglabrat, atque levat, pingit, striat, ungit, and Ornat:
Tota dolus, tota ars, tota histrio, tota venenum.
Consilio speculi gerit omnia, labra movere
Discit, and inspectu vultum componere Vitro:
Discit blandiri, discit ridere, jocari;
Incedens humeros discit vibrare, natesque.
Quid sibi vult nudum pectus? quid aperta superne
Rimula, quae befidam deducit in ubera vallem?
Nempe nihil nisi quo virus penetrabile sensum
Plus premat, and Stygiae rapiant praecordia flammae.
Hi Juvenu^ Scopuli, Syrtes, Scillae, atque Charybdes:
Hae immundae Phinei Volucres, quae ventre soluto
Proluvie foeda thalamos, canacula, mensas,
Compita, Templa, vias, agros, mare, flumina, montes
Incaestare solent: hae sunt Phorcynides ore
Monstrifico extremis Lybiae quae in finihus olim
Aspectu mutare homines in saxa solebant.
Carmina doctiloqui cursim recitavimus Umb^i:
Quae si visa tibi nimium prolixa, memeuto
Ipsius esse rei vitium, non carminis illud:
Non longum est Carmen, mulierum amentia longa est.
O memorande Senex, quo se vetus umbria tantum
Jactat, and ipse tuae Tyberis conterminus urhi:
Martia non abs re tantum te Roma vocabat;
Ipsa tuas arts, and non trivialia norat
Carmina: te vita functum flevere Latinae
Naiades, and Graiae: tua molliter Ossa quiescant
Semper and in summo men's aurea vivat Olympo
Women a servil, savage, proud Kind be,
From measure, law, reason, and right bounds free:
She lovs extremes, does al by headlong will,
Either runs fiercely, or lies grovling still.
She Is frosty Winter, and cold not to be felt;
O^ Dogstar-like, the Earth with heat does melt:
She likes no temper, nor mediocrity:
But lovs too dearly, or hates thee mortaly.
If she be grav, she wails with rough aspect:
If she seem mild, her sternnes she will reject,
And become light; lewdnes with laughing mixed
Breaks forth, and whorish mirth in looks is fixed.
She weeps, laughs, grows sad, mad, fearful, and bold:
Wills, nils, and with her self does strife still hold.
Light, wavring, wandering, prattling, vain, two tounged,
Imperious, wrathful, threatening, bloody minded,
Vile, covetous, scraping, cruning, envious, credulous,
Lying, fierce, bibbing, biting, rash, ambitious,
Light, troublous, Witch, Bawd, and superstitious,
Slow, ravenous, brothel-haunter, luxurious,
Lecherous, malepert, givn to al wantonness;
Full of inticings, givn t'adorn her fairnes.
Holdfast of wrath and hate, revenge puts over
Til fit times, faithless, ingrat, spite does smother;
Bold, violent, cruel, wrangling, rebellious,
Upbraids, defends her faults with words most treacherous:
Repines, makes strife, al compacts vilipends.
Friendship derides, and her own gain attends,
Sports, flatters, dallies, jeasts most bitterly,
Sows tois abroad, and tales does amplify,
And a little Hillock to Olympus magnify.
Dissembles, fains, apt to invent cause demure,
Apt to make wiles, and frames her face to allure;
Her looks that can belief at al points procure.
None can their snares escape, nor shun their guile:
Such Arts they have and cunning to beguile.
Nay though one see her sin, she has impudence
TO excuse her crime, and can delude ones sens,
With subtlety: there is naught thou can beleev;
Nor ought but she will compel thee to forgiv.
Exemples shall make clear: what crimes have not
Bin done by Women? Tarpey with foes did plot,
To yield the Capitol; by their chains deceived:
Bloody Medea her Sons life bereaved:
Helena with Ships the Egean Seas did fill:
Scylla her Fathers hair for his Foe did spil:
Biblis her Brother loved: Myrrha lay with her Sire:
Semiramis to her Son burnt with lustful fire:
Poet Ampharaus by his wife was slaughtred:
Danaus Daughters their Husbands in bed mu^dred:
The Th^acian Hags Orpheus in pieces tore:
Pasiphaes bestial lust is known of yo^e:
Phoedra defiled with lust, used cruelty:
Rebecca deceivd her Husband and Progeny;
By binding a Kids skin on neck and hands drild:
Hercules his Wife with deadly bane him killed:
Hippodam beguild her Sire: Lavinia with war
The Trojans tangled: Bryseis Achilles far
Drew from his Camp: Agamemnon waxing wood
With Chryseis lov, felt Phoebus his angry mood:
Eve^ Mankind d^ov from Edens Garden fair.
Shepherds beleev't, by rustic Gods I swear:
If you will have Pastures to feed Flocks harmless be;
If you take care of Sheep, if you finaly
Lov quiet, peace, or life, light Wenches fly:
And from your Sheepfolds chase far wantons al:
Thystel, Phyllis, Galatee, Neaer, Lycor great and small.
Tell me, what Woman to sad Hell descended
And came back? Eurydice might have reascended
Ha^ she bin wise, the same way she went thither:
Ravished Proserpin would not follow her Mother:
But holy Aeneas, and Orpheus back retired,
Great'st Hercules, Theseus, and two Brothers admired;
One for Hors-fight, the other for wrestling famed:
And our Lord God; whence Health and life was framed.
Shepherds, these mysteries we must well observe:
For manly minds from al obscene things swerv:
But Women in filthy places their lusts serve.
As Mariners driven on Rocks by tempests rape,
Can show to others those perils how to escape:
So by long use a man made wise and old,
Minds past mishaps and future does unfold:
Who times events, and life's dangers has told.
If Sea-Bitds Eagles shun, if Har^s Toils fly:
If Lambs Wolfs, Deer Dogs: why art not thou shy
Shepherd, of Women's lures thy chiefest Enemy?
They Crocadiles tears have, Hyenas subtle wise
To weep, and flatter, that they may beguile:
Shepherd, shun Women's looks, as nets the while.
Trust not thy courage, valor, nor confide
In strength, nor in the Shield which did Perseus hide,
When he Medusa's Snakes safely espied.
Many slu Monsters, and strong Giants tamed,
Sacked Cities, and over Sea-billows were famed:
Stopped Rivers rage, and rough Mountains o'recame:
Some Crowned with Laurel garlands were, but ye same
Who subdued al, by Women were made tame.
The Shepherd King, ^lso with sling a Lion killed;
And his Son who first Sions Temple builded:
And Samson who in matchless strength excelled;
By Women were brought under yoke and quelled:
No fire, stones, swords, spears, nor death so many felled
She not content with her own beauties hew,
Augments it thousand wais for Men to view.
She decks her head with gold, paints cheeks, plaits hair
Frames pace, and looks by Art for to seem fair.
Skips out, her Lover into dark to allure;
Would giv fees, sav to seem chaste and demure;
Denies and strivs, but will be vanquished sure.
She Is like the Northwest wind, strange thing to tell
Which draws clouds, yet seems falsely to dispel,
I having tried, warn thee to try forbear,
What loathsome things this frail Sex in them wear.
By Nature unclean Creatures, but by Art
They seek to mend it, and in dreams often start.
She shavs, plains, paints, makes rough, noints and perfumes;
Al guil, art, Plaier-like, al Venom assumes.
She frames al by her Glass, learns lips to form;
And looks by looking in it to conform;
She learns to flatter, smile, and jeasts devise,
Learns in her gate to jet with arms and thighs.
What means her naked Breast, what the open chink,
Which 'twixt her Dugs a cloven Vale does sink?
Sure naught but that her poison may pierce longer,
And Hellish flames thy heart strings burn ye stronger.
These are Youths Rocks, Syrts, Scilla and Charybd vile:
Foul filthy Harpyes, which with ordure defile
Bed-chambers, dining-rooms, table-bords, high-wais,
Churches, streets, fields, Seas, rivers, hills, and Bais:
These are the Gorgons ugly to behold,
Which dwelt in utmost Lybic coasts of old;
And with their sight turned men into stones cold.
We have the Italian Poets verses cited;
Which if they seem too tedious, let be minded,
That it is the Things fault, not the Poetry:
The Verse is short, but too long Women's folly.
O renownd Man, in whom old Italy
Boasted so much, and Tyber near the City:
Whom Martial Rome not without cause accited:
She knew thy skill and Verses most admited.
The Latin and Greek Muses bewaild thee
After death: let thy bones rest quietly;
And thy sublime Soul live in Heaven on high.
This railing Moan happily learnd this of common Curtezans; as there have bin and
are so bad Men (both Pagans and Christians) in all ages. In the Assyrian
Monarchy was a lustful Semiramis, and far lewder Sardanapalus: in the Roman
Empire a monstrous Messalina, and more prodigious Heliogabalus: nor can
Whordom, Adultery, or Incest be committed unles both Sexes concur, being more
insatiat in their lust then Beasts. It Is a true saying, If Men's Virtues be
conceled and Vices displaied a Saint will seem a Devil: or contrarily: But
charity covers a multitud of sins. For there have bin Women of most admired
Virtues, and exemplar perfections; though mixed with some natural infirmities
liable to that Sex.

Mitius a radiis vibrans crinalibus ignem:
Cum Fidicen juxta ^iberina fluenta, sonanti
Lenibat plectro curas, aeslumque levabat
Ilice defensus nigra, Scenaque virenti.
Audiit hunc hospes Sylvae Philomela propinquae,
Musa Loci, nemoris Siren, innoxia Siren:
Et prope succedens stetit abdita frondibus, alte
Accipiens sonitum, secumque remurmurat; and quoz
Ille modos variat digitis, has guttere reddit.
Sensit se Fidicen ^hilomela imitante referri,
Et placuit ludum volucri dare: before ergo
Explorat Citharam, tentamentumque futurae
Praebeat ut pugnae; percurrit protinus omnes
Impulsu pernice fides: nec segnius illa
Mill perexcurrens variae discrimina vocis,
Venturi specimen praefert argutula Cantus.
Tunc Fidicen per fila movens trepidantia dextram,
Nunc Contemnenti similis diverberat ungue,
Depectitque pari chordas, and simplice ductu:
Nunc carptim replicat, digitisque micantibus urget
Fila minutatim, celerique repercutit ictu;
Mox silet: illa modis totidem respondet, and Artem
Art refert; nunc ceu rudis aut incerta canendi,
Projicit in longum, nulloque plicabile flexu
Carmen init; simili serie certoque tenore
Praebetur liquid m^labenti pectore voci.
Nunc caesim variat, modulisque canora minutis
Delibrat Vocem, tremuloque reciprocat Ore.
Miratur Fidicen, parvis e faucibus ire
Tam varium tam dulce melos; majoraque tentans
Alternat mira art fides: dum torquet acutas,
Inciditque graves operoso verbere pulsat,
Permiscetque simul certantia rauca sonoris;
Vt Tuba socordes clangore ad bella lacessit.
Hoc etiam Philomela canit, dumque ore loquenti
Vibrat acuta sonum, modulisque interplicat aequis;
Ex inopinato gravis intonat, and leve murmur
Turbinat introrsus, alternantique sonore
Clarat and infuscat, ceu Martia Classica pulset.
Scilicet erubuit Fidicen, iraque calente
Aut non hoc referes (inquit) Citharistria Sylvae,
Aut fractae cedam Cithara: nec plura locutus
Non imitabilibus plectrum concentibus urget.
Numque manu pe^ fila volat, simul hos, simul illos
Explorat numeros, chordaque laborat in omni:
Et strepit and tinit, crescitque superbior, and se
Multiplicat relegens, plenoque Choreumate plaudit.
Tunc stetit expectans, si quid paret aemula contra.
Illa autem quamvis vox dudum exercita fauces
Asperat, impatiens vinci simul advocat omnes
Ne quicquam Vires: nam dum discrimine tanta
Reddere tot fidium nativa and simplice tentat
Voce, canaliculisque imitari grandia parvis;
Impar magnanimis ausis, imparque dolori
Deficit, and vitam summo in certamine linquens,
Victoris cadit in plectrum, par nacta sepulchrum:
Usque adeo and tenues Animas ferit aemula Virtus.
The Sun now from the Heavens midday line,
Sending forth milder raise, 'gan to decline:
When near to Tibers streams, a Lutist eased
His cares with sounding charms, and the heat appeased
In a green seat, under a black Oak shaded.
A Nightingal of next Grov hearing invaded:
Muse of the Place, sly Siren of the Wood;
And drawing nigh, hid in the leafs, close stood.
His sounds she cond to her self, and each high strain
His fingers played, her throat beat back again.
The Minstril found the imitating Bird reply,
And was pleased to giv play; therefore more fully
He tries his Lute, and to tender a taste
Of the ensuing conflict, runs through in have
His strings with swift strokes: She a thousand keys
As nimbly warbleth with sweet Voices lays;
Giving a warning sharp and shril of their plais.
The Lutenist with his hand then the small threads plies,
And strikes the quavering strings in scornful wise:
Which he combs equaly, now in several;
Sometimes retouching with his fingers all The strings in order, and with swift stroke plais;
Straight stops: She answers with so many Lays,
And Art with Art pais: next as one in doubt
How she should sing, her tone in length draws out;
And sings a solen strain with constant Note,
Clearing the Lung-pipes with her moistened throat:
Then sings division and with loud shril strain
Poiseth her wavering Voice and falls again.
He wondering how such strange sweet melody
Could from so small throat com; would more strings try
And with rare skill varies the strings, while he
The Treble and the Base strikes painfully:
Mingling the hoarl and shril with mutual strife;
As Warlike Trumpets giv to Cowards life.
This too She tunes, and while with melting voice
She mingles middle measures with deep nois,
Suddenly thunders, jugging inwardly
With gentle murmur, and alternatly
Sings clear and dark, as Wars alarms do cry.
Surely the Minstrel blushd, and in fierce mood,
Thou shall not triumph, Chantress of the Wood;
Or vanquished (said) I Will break my Lute: straight wais
He strains his instrument to matchless Lays:
His hand flies over the strings now here, now there
In diffring numbers, laboring every where.
Both flat and sharp he strikes, and becoms proud;
Closing his doubled strains with Consort loud.
Then looking stood, if 's Rival would reply:
But tho her straind Voice had her throat made dry,
She loath to yield, her whole strength tries in vain:
For while she strivs with nativ simple strain
Of Voice t'express such diverse lofty Lays,
With slender Pipes to reach high Notes like these:
Out-matchd with daring deeds, out-matchd with woe,
She faints and dies at last bout of her Foe:
On Victors Lute she fell, being a fit Grav:
Even so small Souls such emulous Virtu have.

framed this Fancy in 58 Heroic Hexameters: which Dr. Strode of Christ-Church at
Oxford, elegantly translated into 80 English metres; being 22 mo then the
Latin: but are here rudely rendered in equal numbers or measures verse for verse,
and very near the letter, according to my plain Pedantic garb or guise, who

Rector; and incerto fluerent Mortalia casu?
Sed cum res hominum tanta caligine ^olvi
Aspicerem, latosque diu florere Nocentes,
Vexarique bonos; pietas labefacta cadebat,
Fortuna, non Art regi: quae Numina sensu
Ambiguo vel nulla putat, velnescia nostri.
Cum rapiant mala fata bonos, ignoscite fasso; Ovid.

Solicitor nullos esse putare Deos.

Whether the Gods Earthly affairs have wrought:
Or else no Ruler was, and things by chance fell?

Managd to be; and bad Men long to prosper,
And the good vexd: my Piety 'gan to daver,
That Fortune, not Art rules: that Gods none are,
Or such as of us Mortals take no care.
When Good men by il fates fall, pardon me;
I am allured to think no Gods there be.
