The honest VVELCH-COBLER, for her do scorn to call her self the simple
Welch-Cobler:

Although her thinks in all her Consciences, if her had as many as would stand
between Paul's and Sharing-Crosse that her have not so much wit as her Prother
Cobbler of America, yet her think her may have as much knavery; and though her
have not so much Creek, which her holds to be Heathenish; nor Hebrew, which her
holds to be Shewish Language; nor Latin, which is the Language of Rome, yet
her shall endever her self to teliver her self in as cood Tialect as her can
for her heart plood, for the petter understanding of all her friends and
kindred, whether Comro or Siss, wherein her shall find variety of counsels,
profitable instructions, seasonable cautions, to prevent tangers that may come
upon all her countrymen here; Her also shall find some truth little honesty,
some wit, and a creat teale of knaverie.

The honest Welsh Cobbler.
WHen her take into teep and serious consitteration the many abuses and
reproaches cast upon her teer friends and countrymen, it many times makes her
serach where it toth not itch, and finding no redress tat way, put rather more
trouble and perplexity poth in her head and mind, her resolved with her self
of another course for her own and her country men's findication, tat is as
much as to say, to publish to the world some little Tract or Treatise, for her
is fery eloquent, wherein her is minded to show to the world the candor of her
ententions, and the excellency of her inventions, the sharpness of her wit,
and the rashness of her Judgment, which her had rather call the ripeness of
Shudgment, her skill in Philosophy, her dexterity in Divinity, her
magnanimous Chavaldrie in Martial Discipline, and her knowledge in
State-Maximes, as her may so call it, put to tell her the truth, and no more
put the truth, her canowes not the meaning of the word, put only her makes
pold to use the word, to show her elegancie of speech, though her pee no more
able to understand it then her is able to understand one of the creat
mountains in Wales. Put now her think out, her can understand more of her
Welsh mountain then her can of her hard frases, for her can coe up to the top
of her Welsh mountain, and tigg stones and tirt enough to preake her pack, and
lay it on her head or shoulder, and then her unterstands it, mark her tat now.
Put to avoid prolixitie, her will preak off prefacing any longer, put fall close
to her puisines: put now her talk of puisines, first her had pest do her
puisines that none can do put her self, for fear her make a peastly piece of
work ont, put first her will sing a song pefore her coe any further.

Taffie was prave, and her puilt her a Cave,
under the foot of a Mountain,
Taffie was fine, and her tranke of the wine,
the water out of the Fountain:
Taffie eat Apple-Crabb, put her love was a Trabb,
for trinking the whey out of the firking,
Put all the long day of her Harp her will play,
and make the lowse tance in her Sherking.
There was a time when her Welsh wit would work like her Welsh wine, otherwise
called Matheglinn, and lick up cold, as her countrymen use to lick up Welsh
Flumrey, put neither wit now nor honesty will pay any thing in her Welsh
Markets, her must set her self flat and close to her Trade of Cobling, and
first I shall beekin with the createst piece of work I have, though it may be
worst paid for it, and that is Prince Ruperts Boots to sole, and he uses to
pay folks with his Poleax. You may remember, as I was informed by some of
her-owne Countrymen, and those none of the pest quality tat made a shift to
save her selves by the nimble agilitie of her heels at Marston fight, that
Prince Rupert to save her self, ran over the Bean field, and there her lost
either one or both her soles, her stuck so fast in the Clay: and here her
cannot put commend her for her wit, for her is sure her will never pe hanged for
her honesty, tat her would parallel her self with her Cossens of Wales, tat
when her see her could not overcome by sighting, to save her self by flying;
and for tat trick and one more that her canowes her will set her on a pair of
the pest soles tat her wore in her life cratis, because her canow tat her lost
all tere and at Nazby, and never cot any cood fortune since, except a purge and
a broken shyn at Abbington, and a little strong Beer at Bristol, and tere her
was forced to leave the createst part behind him, because he could not stay to
drink it but upon these conditions, first, that her come no more a plundring
into her Welsh territories, to carry away her cood Welsh She Is, that her should
cost for her none self, her wife and shildren, which though her sayt her
self, is made as cleanly as any She Is in all Wales, for her wife strained it
through the skirt of her foul smock, for fear there should be any hayres of
her Cow or Goat in her She Is to shoake her.

Secondly, tat if her ever shance to come again into England or Wales, and to
have any of her countrymen under her command, tat her pring tem no further on,
ten her can canow how to pring tem off with credit, and not run away from tem
in te midst of te pattle, and leave tem to shift for temselves while her self
fall to plundring of wagons and so her self cet all te money, while her
countrymen get kanocks: and upon the performances of these conditions, her
will give her some advice which will do her no hurt, if her will take it: and
first, tat her come no more into England or Wales, if her can help it, to
fight, for though her be a man of valor, and loves to fight when her cannot
shuse, yet her kanowes by experience that her may meet with her match in
England, tat will past her sides, and preake her pate, and send her home to her
own country for a plaster, and what will her get by tat?

Secondly, tat her use her utmost endever to make her peace with cood
Parliament and people of England: for if her well consider with her self what
cood tey have done for her, and what mischief her has done for them, her will
find cause enough to look about her I warrant her. But her feel her self not
well, call in some of her kindred, for her is resolved to make her Will, and
set her house in order, pefore her go away and pe seen no more, and if her
shance to mend, her will follow her own Trade again: put in the mean time
her will make an Inventorie of all her cood and bad movables and immoveables,
and make her Cozen Maurice Executor.

Imprimis, in her ped-shamber one foul wife and five small shildren, those
being part of her moveable pads, I wish from her heart they were removeable.
Item, in another shamber two pair of eurst Queanes toungues, or tongs should I
call them, no, its no matter, they will pinch worse then tongs, they are
movables I Will warrant you. Item, in her Pride-shamber one pair of Horns upon
her peds head, tat her may thank her wife for, and these are unmovable coods.
Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautem; Happy is her whom other men's Horns
do make to beware. Item, one proken pate owing to her by one of her neighbors
for a cood turn her tid tem seven years ago, that is desperate debt. Item,
five hundred shrewd turns owing to me from her Cosens of England, for and in
consiteration of diverse Horse, Cowes and Sheep her stole from them, put these
are desperate debts also.
Put now her spirits pegins to come to her again, and therefore one word to
Prince Maurice, for her has peen a creat Tancer in her time, and her is
doubtful that her soles of her poots begin to wear out, and therefore her
will pestow a pair of soles upon him, if her thought her would take it in cood
part, and her would give her cood counsel with all her heart plood: first,
that her would not tance any more after such ungodly measures tat her has done
in former times, in firing houses, killing cood Ministers, and tivers of her
own tear countrymen which cave her no cause at all: I would have her
consider, tat it were too base a calling for one of her plood and quality to
turn Lyme burner, if her remember when and how well her was paid for her
pains: when her went apout to purne Lyme, her should consider, that it was
unfit for her Highness to purne whole Towns in England, when her had never a
House nor Cottage of her own, little or pigg, to make satisfaction for the
wrongs which her had done; and though her prother was made Duke of Cumberland,
yet it were put Titular; what is her Title worth now? in her shudgment it is
not worth the smoke of one of her Welsh Ladles, when her wife makes
Leeke-pottage: and therefore her say, Prince, if her pee wise, keep her away
while her is well, for as her is a Prince of the plout Royal, if her never be
caught, her can never be questioned: and think her have given her cood
counsel, and her hope her will not pee crusty, though her pee somewhat
hard-bakt, if her should hear, that her and her prother peeing grown men,
have helped to rob five hundred tat helped to feed tem when tey were shildren.

And pefore her forget her, forget her did her say, her warrant her her shall
never forget her while her live, nor twenty year after, the Marquis of
Newcastle, a pox on her picture, her thinks her was no witch, put her made her
self as plack as a Tivell with her Coale-dust, no matter if her had peen
choakt with it, for her made many of her friends and countrymen in and about
London to fret themselves hot, and at last many were glad to sell or pawn all
tat her selfs and her wifes and shildren had workt for all her life time, to
get her some fire. Put if ever her catch her in her Welsh Territories, her will
make her run as fast as her did when her run away beyond Sea after
Marston-moore, and therefore if her canow when her is well, let her keep her
self where her is, and if her have worn out her poots in her running march
its pest for her to go to her Cousen Cobbler in America, and her will parch her
poot for her cratis, for her do tell her in plain terms it is not safe for
her to come upon out Welsh or English coasts, for fear her should catch a
blocish Ague, as her Cousen Strafford did or the Beshits Crace of Canterbury,
and many others which her could name, for if te Parliament shance to feel her
pulses and find her not well qualified for to take some Parliament physic to
purge away all her Malignant humors, yet her will go near to let her plood in
te neck, and then her mind will be quite shanged her will rever be cood after
it, and so her takes her leave of her Marquis of Newcastle, better take her
leave here then at the --

Next her would entreat the new Lord Capell, a Lord of te last Edition, her do
scorn to call her Cow-stealer, her father was an honest Shentleman, and kept a
cood house, her little thought of leaving a Son so famous for Coward ze and
Cow-stealing, but Tawsone, her will say no more only her would entreat her
never to come more into Wales, for her do tell her, tat her is like to loofe
her labor if her come, for her have almost no Cowes left in Wales: Therefore
her had as cood keep her where her is as come to trouble her and her
Countrymen and her self, too I could tell her her none, but her spares her
because her was lately created Baron of Haddum, but now her thinks her may now
be called Baton of Hadland, for her could tell her how many creat Pig-houses
her had in Hartfordshire, where her Baronie of Hadland, Haddum I should say
lies, where her knows her utship had Parks where were as many horned Beasts as
there are apps in her Welsh Sheneologes, and so her have done with her urship
for this time, only her would entreat her urship if her have any Cow-Hides
left, tat her would put them to tanning for fear her should want leather to
sole her poots, and so Du Cat en ergh.

Put room for Cottington that Spanish Fox, her had more familiarity with
Roman keese then were fit for her urship to have for they have hatched many
Cockatrice eggs against the City and Parliament, and they proved gallant
Goosling in his eye for the time, but now they are all dashed, her heard that
her urship was made Lord High Treasurer, but now her tall Cedar-like Honor is
laid in the dust, but her will tell her one infallible truth which her urship
will not deny: Since her left her Urships creat House in Proadstreet, there
has pin more money told then all her Honor is worth, if her Honor were to be
sold by weight, but her urship has found by her none experience, that there
pee shurch in England that will unkennell the subtilest old Fox in Spain, if
her come here to give evil counsel, her would wish her urship to earth her
self in some other soil, if her love her self and her ears, come not into
her Welsh teritories, for her have put few Sheep or Lambs, nor Goats, nor Kids,
nor Tucks, nor Hens, nor Keese, nor Koostins, lest in her principallity of
Wales, and beside her have Foxes Diggon in Wales, and therefore her desires
none of her company in Wales, to devour her Welsh Poultry, so farewell and be
-- Foxes never fare better then when they are cursed.

Put now her can forbear no longer, her was ready to preake packwards, and
then her should long her cood flanell shirt which cost two croats put half a
year ago, when her call to mind one of her own countrymen flesh, plood and
pone, her cannot shuse but admire at her, her mean the Pishop of York, the
Weathercock, the wonder of her age, her should have said, but her hope her
Preterne of England will pardon her expressions, I hope her will not deny her
wonted privilege, that is, to tell her tale twice her being a Welchman put to
her matter in hand, her countryman is metal to the hard ars, for her can use
her Paul's Sword, as well as her Peter's Keys, her may see that while there is
life there is hopes, her had as many thought to see the Tevill turn Presbyter
as her countryman and kinsman Williams, put now her think a Windmill would
better beceme her head then a Miter, and so het will take her leave of her
countryman.

And then there is her Cousen Wren, that little Bird, but her was ferry full of
mischief as her sheese use to be full of Maggots, this is her that kept the
Tailors wife at Cambridge, and made her Husband look through a pair of
horning Spectacles, all the Soape and Sophistry in Cambridge will not wash out
that spot in her Lawne Sleeves, her was put to silence above threescore
Ministers at one Fifie, her was creat instrument in placing scandalous Priests
up and town her Country, where her had to do, such as was in her own Country,
that would read service in the forenoone and pe trunk in the afternoon, nay,
perhaps be trunk all the week after, and yet they were so covetous, tat her
had put thirteen eggs in an Nest and her went to law with her, and made her
spend ten pounds, pecause her gave her but one for Tyth: but now her little
Wren is met withal, now her cannot do mischief as her did before, her is in
the Tower and her do pray her Lieutenant and her Warders to look well to her,
for her is put a little Pird, and can get out at a little hole, and her would
pray her to keep her wings clipped, for fear her should fly away; her thinks
in Conscience her cood Parliament might do well to send her to New England to
work for her living, for her have bin so cood in Old England that no pody cares
for her company, and beside shange of Air may shange his mind, for her have
heard men say tat shange of pasture makes fat Calves, and why not shange of
climates make fat Knaves, her canow that her preterne of England would be glad
to be rid of him, and so much for Wren.

Her had almost forgot her Lordship Littleton, that run away with the Creat
Seal, her was never the wiser man for that, nor never the honester man, to
play the knave with them that dealt so well with him: but her have not much to
say to her, because her have but little acquaintance with her, only take beed
to her self, for her knows what is the reward of a pick-pocket petter then
her self.

And then there is the Lord Hopton, a man of metal, and a wife man, or else
he should be, for there is not one hair between her and the sky, it is pity
her was ever engaged in such a quarrel, her was feign to sell her honesty to buy
her a periwig of honor, a Titular Baronie, and now her is glad to hop away,
and leave her House and Land behind her, and carry nothing with her but her
Periwig, which is but light of carriage, her may carry it whither her will with
her, except her come to London, and then her most lay it down, but her think
hardly her will come there; farewell frost, if her never come again there is
nothing lost.

FINIS.
