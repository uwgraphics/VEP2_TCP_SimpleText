A PROGNOSTICATION Upon W: LAVD late bishop of Canterbury written An^o: Dom:
1641: Which accordingly is come to pass
behold a traitors head



My little Lord me thinks it is strange
that you should suffer such a change
jn such a little space
You that so proudly the other day
did rule the king and country sway
must trudge to another place
Remember now from whence you came
and that your grandsiers of your name
were dressers of old cloth
Go bid the dead men bring there shers
and dress your coat to save your ears
or paune your head for both
The wind shakes cedars that are tall
an haughty mind must have a fall
you are but low I see
And good it had bin for you still
If both your body mind and will
In equal state should be
The King by harkening to Your charms
Hugd our destruction in his arms
and gates to foes did open
Your staff would strike his scepter down
your mighter would ore top the crown
jf you should be a pope
But you that did so firmly stand
to bring in popery to this land
have mist your hellish aim
Your saints fall down your angels fly
your crosses on your self do lie
your crafts will be your shame
We scorn that popes with Crosier staves
Miters orkeyes should make us slaves
and to there feet to bend
The pope and his malicious crew
we hope to handle all like you
and bring them to an end
The silcnce clergy void of fear
jn your damnation will have share
and speak there mind at large
Your cheskake cap and magpy gown
that made such strife in every town
must now defray your charge
Within this six years six Ears have
bin cropped of worthy men and grave
for speaking what was true
But if your subtle head and ears Can satisfy those six of there is expect but
what is your due
Poor peaple that have felt your rod
yield laud to the devil praise to god
for freeing them from thrall
Your little grace for want of grace
must loose your patriarcall place
and have no grace at all
your white lawne sleeves that were ye wings
whereon you soard to lofty things
must be your fins to swim
Tharch bishops sea by thames must go
with him unto the tower below
there to be rackt like him
your oath cutts deep your lies hurt sore
your cannons made scots cannons rore
but now I hope you will find
That there are cannons in the tower
will quickly batter down your power
and sink your haughty mind
The cominalty have made a vow
no oath no cannons to allow
no bishops common prayer
No lazy prelates that shall spend
such great revenues to no end
but virtue to jmpaire
Dum dogs that wallow in such store
that would suffice above a score
pastors of upright will
Now they will make all the bishops teach
and you must in the pulpit preach
that stands on Tower Hill
When the yeoung lads to you did come
you knew there meaning by the drum
you had better yielded then
Your head and body then might have
One death one burial and one grave
by boys but two by men
But you that by your judgments clear
will make five quarters in a year
and hang them on the gates
That head shall stand upon the bridge
when yours shall under traitors trudge
and smile on your mist fates
The little ren that soard so high
thought on his wings away to fly
like finch I know not whither
But now the subtle whirly wind
debauk has left the bird behind
you two must flock together;
A bishops head a debutys breast
A finches tongue a wren froms nest
will set the devil on foot
He Is like to have a dainty dish
at once both flesh and foul and fish
and duck and lamb to boot
But this I say though your lewd life
did fill both church and state with strife
and trample on the Crown
like a blessed martyr you will dye
for churches good she rises high
when such as you fall down
sold at the black bull in cornhill near the Royal exchange
