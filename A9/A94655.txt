To the Right Honorable, The Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament: THE
HVMBLE PETITION OF The Captains, Officers, and Soldiers of the Trained Bands,
and Volunteers of the County of BUCKINGHAM, assembled at Alesbury, June 17.
1642.
Humbly shows,
THat they give you thanks from the depth of their hearts, for the great and
main benefit they have already received, from Your no less chargeable then
Indefatigable pains; And in particular, for your necessary Ordinance of the
Militia, of which, as we conceive, (under God) our safety does depend; unto
which we most cheerfully submit, as is manifest by this days appearance; not
only of the Trained Bands, but of well near 1000. Volunteers, that made all
demonstration of obedience, as well to this, as to all other Commands that shall
come from Your Honorable Houses, in opposition to the Popish or Malignant
party at home, or any other power from abroad; Notwithstanding the main
visible discouragements from ill-affected persons, that made it their
business, to blemish the validity of your Authority; as also, by the Lord
Lieutenants absence, contrary to the Trust reposed in him.

Therefore we humbly implore the continuance of your care for our safety, and
to appoint such a Lord Lieutenant in whom we may confide, as surely as you may
in us, who are resolved to lay our Lives and Fortunes at your feet, in defense
of the King and Parliament.

And we shall pray, etc.
24. JUNII:
ORdered that the Lords be moved to join with this House, in nominating the
Lord Wharton to be Lord Lieutenant of the County of Buckingham, in stead of the
Lord Paget: And that this Petition shall be forthwith printed.
