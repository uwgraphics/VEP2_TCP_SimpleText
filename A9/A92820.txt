He shall take Monsieur, the Sea drown you
Then are ye both Thumpt and Mumpt and Mumpt, etc.
Now to conclude I will take care
As Ballads use to end with Prayer,
With a Thump, etc.
For Ballads made of the old Fashion
Should still conclude with Supplication
For King and Queen, and the whole Nation
With a Thump, etc.
God Bless the Swede, he is not our Foe,
And Spains King too though France say no,
They both wish the Dutch well Thumpt, Thumpt, etc
Heaven send our Fleet Auspicious Gales
Our King and Queen a Prince of Wales
And then let who will bite their Nails
When we all our foes have Thumpt, and Mumpt, etc..
