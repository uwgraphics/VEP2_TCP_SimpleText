TO THE HONORABLE THE KNIGHTS, CITIZENS, AND Burgesses in this present
Parliament assembled.
The humble Petition of Clement Walker, and William Prynne, Esquires.
Shows,
THat your Petitioners, by public Proclamations (posted up at Westminster, and
the Exchange,) and by private Summons, were involuntarily engaged by Colonel
Nathaniel Fiennes (who by several Orders of this House, upon his own
spontanious Motions, put himself upon the trial of a Council of War,
declining the Parliament, though a Member of it) to exhibit Articles of
Impeachment against him, not out of any private interests, but only in the
Kingdoms behalf; that he, contrary to his trust, duty, and sundry promises, to
defend the City and Castle of Bristoll (of which he was Governor) to the
uttermost extremity, to dispute every Foot, yea, Inch thereof with the Enemy,
to lay his bones therein, and to make his Flag of truce his winding sheet; did
most cowardly and traitorously surrender the same, with all the Ammunition,
Canon, Arms, Magazines, Provisions, Prisoners therein, and the very Colors
too, into the hands of Prince Rupert, and other common Enemies of the Kingdom,
upon the entering of not above one hundred and fifty enemies within the Line, at
a place worst fortified and guarded (who all gave themselves for dead men, and
might have easily been cut off at first;) and that before any one of the
Out-Forts taken, the Walls of the City or Castle once battered, assaulted, or
the siege thereof continued three whole days (though he wanted neither Men,
Ammunition, nor Victuals to have defended the same for three months space or
more, against all the Enemies power,) to the irreparable damage of the
Republike, the loss of the Western parts, the hazard of the whole Realm, and
infinite enriching, strengthening, advantaging of the common Enemy both by Land
and Sea, etc. Upon which Articles, after a full and honorable hearing for nine
days space, before a Council of War at Saint Albanes, the said Colonel the
29, of December last was found guilty, and Judgment pronounced against him,
That his head should be cut off.

Yet notwithstanding some friends of his, to blemish your Petitioners, and that
Honorable Councels just proceedings, have confidently reported in London,
Westminster, and elsewhere: that your Petitoners did retract all, and could not
prove any of their Articles; that they cried peccavi, asked the Colonel
forgivenes; who made such a brave defense, and came of with such Honor as
never any man did before him; that he was absolutely acquitted from all
cowardice and treachery, and condemned only for not firing that famous City,
which his conscience would not permit, nor the Parliament in honor could not
have suffered him to do; That his guard continued upon him but two days after
sentence, that he is already set at liberty, pardoned, (though we humbly
conceive no person can The King himself cannot pardon an offense or injury
against the Commonwealth, without the Parliament; nor any offense, where any
private person shall have a particular interest, as our Law Books resolve.
pardon his judgment in this common case, without special order of both
Houses,) and shall shortly sit in the House again. By reason of which false
reports your Petitioners, for their cost and pains in this public
prosecution, have been much defamed; his Excellencies, and the Honorable
Council of Wars proceedings insufferably traduced, truth disguised, the well
affected party discontented, malignants mouths opened to complain of
partiality, the Honor and Justice of the high Court of Parliament principally
interressed in this trial (directed by several Orders of this House)
blemished, and a high way prepared in these perilous times (which daily produce
new monstrous Plots to undermine Us) to betray all Forts, and Cities yet
remaining in Your power, through Treachery or Cowardice, if this signal
leading president of grandest public concernment, shall be thus openly
traduced, and the execution of it so suddenly, so slightly passed over as is
reported; especially since the condemned Delinquent, has both in speeches and
printed Relations justified this his unworthy action to the utmost before this
Honorable House, the Council of War, World, not yet making the least
acknowledgement of, submission or satisfaction for the same, and denied at the
trial that Colonel Essex was ever Governor of Bristol, or that he did
apprehend or remove him, or that himself was ever Governor of this City or
Castle, or undertook to defend the same, or had any Commission to keep it,
but only to keep his soldiers in order; the contrary to all which appeared
by his own evidence, and that he has twice sent for, received, accepted an
independent Commission by all possible ways and means to provide for the
defense and security of the same City against all enemies and opposition
whatsoever. And when his sentence was pronounced, he appealed from it to the
Parliament, which he had formerly declined, arraigned his Judges after
sentence, by demanding the reasons of their judgment, (which he said he little
expected,) and what witnesses they allowed or disallowed? and most injuriously
attributed the loss of Bristol and the West, with Our prosecution of this
cause, (proceeding merely from his own solicitation) to an Honorable member
of this House now employed in great command, with happy success; most falsely
averring to the Council, That he was thus eagerly prosecuted by your
Petitioners, at Sir William Wallers instigation, only for the great affection
which he and his father did bear, and the good service they had done to my
Lord General and his Army.

In tender consideration whereof, they humbly supplicate this Honorable House
to take the Premises into your just and serious Examination, that so the
Authors of these false reports may receive such exemplary Punishments, as may
deter others from like slanders; your Petitioners, and others defamed by
them, such just reparation in their Honors, as may encourage them to do Your
Honors and Kingdom further service; and the Delinquent such impartial
execution, as shall most redound to the Parliaments, Republikes future
security, and prevention of Offenders of this nature, without which no safety
can be expected.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray, etc. Clement Walker. William Prynne.
