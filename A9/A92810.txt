The Preface TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader,
HAving lately perused a little Book, called HIND's Ramble, or a History of his
pranks and Exploits, and finding many of his Knaveries undiscovered, I thought
good to publish to the World these ensuing Stories of him as a sec^nd part, to
give Gentlemen and Travelers direction to avoid many dangers, which they may
fall into: and to give you, as near as I can, a more perfect character of him.
This James Hind was by his Country, Glocestershire, his former profession a
Butcher, which, had he not been drawn away with ill company, might have
maintained him in an honest way: For Sleights and stratagems none can parallel
him: he may be called a Master in the Art of Theevery, as the cunningest and
wisest of the Company, for difficult and dangerous Thefts; he has the Theory
and Practique of the Art: He has not his name for naught: for when mounted, he
is as swift as a Hind, as rapacious as an Eagle, nothing comes amiss: and to
palliate all these, he is a fine companion, facetious and witty: and to be
short, he has more tricks then a hundred of his fraternity: so much for his
character.

And thus, courteous Reader, have I given a true relation, in this various and
pleasant History, of the wicked policies of HIND and his Companions, that
thou may be forewarned of unhappily falling into their dangers; also it may
serve as a warning piece to those that are wickedly inclined, that they may be
led from the Precipice of Perdition into the safe way of Virtue and Honesty.

The second Discovery of HINDE's Exploits. BEING A full Relation of his
Robberies, Cozenage, and Escapes.
1 How Hind being left alone, and most of his Crew dispersed by a Hue and Cry,
not having his own horse, and in distress for money, robbed five Gentlemen as
they were riding to a wedding; and how he was taken Prisoner.
HIND having intelligence of a great Feast made by a Country Gentleman, where
were many Gentlemen to meet, who lived some four, or six, or ten miles off the
place appointed, there being a wedding, or some such like occasion, takes his
Horse in the morning, and coasting the Country, meets with a Gentleman and his
man riding toward the foresaid House, bids them Stand, and without much
dispute the Gentleman delivers him 20. pounds in Gold, thinking it better to
escape with a whole skin, then lose his money, and be beaten to boot. By that
time they were parted comes to his view an ancient Penifather, with his only
heir, who one would not have thought would have parted with their money so
quietly: Hind knowing 'twas no time for him to dally, bids them Stand, sets
his pistol to the breast of the young gallant; the old man being struck with a
pannick fear, cries out, Save his life, and take his money, which was quickly
done, together with his Sword; and then it came to the old man's turn to
deliver, who was as ready to give as he to ask: their pockets being both
emptied, Hind threw the young gallant his Sword again, and bad him learn to
make better use of it, and draw it as occasion was offered. But the old man,
willing to save the credit of his son, resolved to make no words of it, and the
gentleman before (being robbed) had taken the same resolution also, that the
Ladies should not laugh at their hard fortune. Hind immediately taking another
rode, meets another Gentleman riding to the same house, and he resolving to
make his forenoons work worth his labor, bids him Stand, the Gentleman drew,
Hind showed him his pistol; You may thank that for your prize (quoth the
Gentleman,) your sword should not have won my money. At which gallantry Hind
was well pleased, and gave him five of his fifteen pieces back again. By this
time Hind thought his mornings work was over, it growing toward dinner time
intended to march toward his Comradoes, who were dispersed by a Hue and Cry,
which followed them three days before for another Robbery: and having not his
own horse under him, thought it not best to stay too long thereabouts: Having
no sooner taken this resolution, but he spies another young Gentleman (supposed
to be a younger Brother) upon a good Gelding riding that way; Hind being full
of confidence, resolved to take his Money and be gone, bids him Stand, at which
word the Gentleman dismounts, and draws his sword; quoth Hind, Shall I be
troubled more with thee, than all that be gone before? Since thou art so
gallant, thou shall have fair play for thy Money: puts up his pistol, dismounts
also, and draws his sword; and having made a close or two, neither being
wounded, Hind would as willingly have been rid of his Gamester, as the
Gentleman would have been of him; But ere they could agree on the matter, came
riding an old Gentleman with a surly Serving-man, who knew the engaged
Gentleman, and was quickly off his Horse with his sword drawn; Quoth Hind, We
are two fair gamesters, we need no third man: Yes always, quoth the
Serving-man, at in and in, which I suppose is your sport; With that the
Gentleman made a close with Hind, and quickly the Serving-man had his hand in
Hinde's pocket, but drew forth naught but his pistol, at which Hind yielded
himself Prisoner.

2 How Hind, after he was taken prisoner by the last Gentleman and
Serving-man, was carried to Dinner with them, where he met with all those he
had robbed that morning; and after much pleasant discourse, gave them the slip
with a good gelding worth 50 pounds.
Hind being taken prisoner by the young Gentleman and Serving man, thought it
good to go quietly with them, that so be might be the better able to make an
escape when he saw occasion; and said, Sir, I am now your prisoner, pray let me
know whither you are riding; Quoth he, but to a Gentleman's house about two
miles off, to dine with some friends, whither I intend you shall march; Quoth
Hind, I believe there be some gentlemen gone before will be glad to see me.
You shall be civilly used, quoth the Gentleman, and dine with us, and then
shall I deliver you to the Justice. They being come to the house, Dinner being
set, the Master of the House saluted Hind, and bad him welcome, as the young
Gentleman's friend, and caused him to sit down at Table; Hind takes a glass of
wine in his hand, and drinks to all the Company, especially to those of his
acquaintance (as he called them) whom he had robbed in the morning. Quoth the
old Penifather, Could thou not be content with so good a breakfast, but must
thou come and affront my son and me at Dinner? At which words the whole
business was understood, and the one said, he was robbed of so much, and
another of so much, and all acknowledged what they had lost. I thank ye all
Gentlemen, quoth Hind, for my breakfast; but I am most engaged to this
Gentleman, for he would not let me pass till he brought me to a plentiful
Dinner. Much mirth past at the Table, and Hind fitted them with very good
discourse for the day; That pleased the company so well, that each man
endeavored to show him what favor they could; so that after Dinner they took him
out into the Court, where the Master of the House had a gallant young Gelding,
never backed before that day, which was very unruly, and had thrown two or three
Riders; quoth Hind, if it please you Gentlemen to give me leave, I shall bring
this Gelding to a pace in a quarter of an hour; There being a high wall round
the yard, none mistrusted his intention; he mounts the Gelding with the Masters
leave, and was commended by all the Gentlemen for a very good horseman; having
sufficiently chafed and madded the mettalsom Beast, and spying a little broken
place in the wall, with a full carier leapt the gelding over, and turning
about, said, I thank you all Gentlemen for my Breakfast and Dinner, but I must
sup above forty miles off this night. So the Clark lost his labor in making his
Mittimus, and his Master a Gelding worth fifty pounds.

3 How Hind cozened an Innkeeper, by pretending himself to be some great
Lord, to the value of threescore pounds.
THere is no game comes amiss, but Hind has skill in it; in his low Estate he
has his conceits, and now he is a pretended Lord, here we shall show you how he
sends some of his Comradoes in the habit of Serving-men to take up a Lodging
for their Master in an Inn, telling that he was a great Lord, and was desirous
to lie there about some business; but withal they told him he must have
extraordinary fare, as Rabbits and Chickens, and all other dainties, no
Butchers meat would go down with him; and to color the business, he sent him
two great iron bound chests, with strong locks, and mailed with cords, and gave
order they should be put in the best room in the House, as if there had been
some rich business in it; So when the Lodging was fitted, the next day comes in
Hind like a great Lord, or Don of Spain, and was welcomed by the Host with a
great deal of respect and honor; nothing was omitted that might any way give
him content: And thus he continued for some certain time; for he went out upon
his Robbery, and came in again in his Coach, and none suspected or mistrusted;
and when he thought he had layn there long enough, for fear of discovery he
took an occasion to borrow threescore pounds of his Host, pretending some
extraordinary business; the credulous Host believes him, and lends it him, he
having (as he thought) such good security; But (the Bird being now flegged, it
is time to take wing and be gone,) Hind goes out in the morning in his Coach,
but was too wise to come any more there: he is expected at night, but no Lord
comes, his Lordship was gone another progress; he stays a week, and appears
not; a Month expires, and he is not seen: At last the Host begins to be
jealous, and mistrusts, That all is not gold that glisters; He now begins to
think, there is some Knavery; and (to be short) calls a Constable, and he sits
ready to take an Inventory of the goods in the chests; The two great Chests are
unmailed, or uncorded, the Locks are broken open; which being done, alas then
his grief appears; For in stead of rich treasure, he finds nothing but two
Chests full of stones and old rubbish crammed together.

4 How Hind cozened a Merchant in Holland of 300 Crowns, by giving a
counterfeit chain for a pledge.
THis jovial Gamester, Hind, being in Holland, having spent his Money, casts
his wits about how to recrute himself; and you know good workmen never want
their tools: You may remember I told you how he served the Innkeeper, just
almost in the same manner he beguiles the Dutchman; He goes after the fashion
of a Gallant, the better to set a gloss upon his Knavery; he has his man to
wait upon him; and by his gallant garb insinuates into a rich Merchants
acquaintance; makes the World believe he has brought the wealth of the Indies
with him; he pretends he has great wealth, and happy were he that could be
acquainted with him, for it is the nature of the Dutchmen to strike sail for
their own profit, to offer any Kindness where they perceive they may be any way
a gainer: Amongst the rest, a Merchant of no mean quality perceiving his
deportment, invites him to his house; this gudgeon with little entreaty quickly
swallows the bait, and accepts his proffer; when come to his House the Merchant
entertains him with a great deal of civility; Hind pretends to send one of his
men to his two chests, which were aboard of a ship in the Key, for some Money,
which made the Merchant say, Sir, I much wonder you being a stranger dare trust
your wealth in such a place; if you please sir, my house shall be at your
pleasure. But Hind takes an occasion upon discourse to pull out of a Box a
Chain of pure gold before the Merchant, which he much admiring, said, Sir, you
need not want Money so long as you have this to engage. Hind replied, I should
be loath to engage it but upon on necessity, which I am now driven to; For
although I have Money, yet I cannot command it, because I must pay it presently
upon a Bill of exchange: Sir, replied the Merchant, I shall befriend you so far
as to lend you so much money as you have occasion for: Which proffer Hind as
modestly denied, yet with a kind of willing unwillingness he kindly accepted
his courtesy, and presently called for his man to take the Chain, and see what
the Goldsmith would value it at, and to bring a Test under his hand. The
Merchant as seeming unwilling to receive his Chain as a pledge, replied, Good
Sir do not trouble your self so, I dare take your word for more then this sum;
(yet his fingers itcht to be fingering of this pawn;) Hind the more puts it
upon him, seeing his unwillingness to receive it;) Well Sir, says the
Merchant, seeing it is your pleasure, my man shall go with your servant to see
the value of it at the Goldsmiths. Hind calls his man, delivers him the Chain,
and together they go, and bring a Test under the Goldsmiths hand, who finds it
right and rich. Now Hind had played his game so, that he had provided his man
with another Chain of brass gilded, of the same weight to a grain, that you
could not know the one from the other; and coming home, delivers the brass
Chain and Ticket to Hind; Hind delivers them to the Merchant, he looks upon
it, finds it (to his thinking) the same, sees nothing to the contrary: So Hind
receives his 300 Crowns, and when they had dined and talked, Hind and his man
took their leaves for the present, as pretending to go about business, but
never returned to redeem his Chain, but left the Merchant to repent him of his
dear bought purchase.

5 How Hind and his Myrmidons robbed a Company of Tories in Ireland.
WHen Hind was in his progress in Ireland, he would sometimes scout out, and
lurk about for a prey, with the rest of his Comradoes, and by chance he met two
or three Tories, who had got a prize of Money and Plunder, and were returning
to their Fastues, or Quarters, but they had not so good luck with it as they
expected, for Hind and his Myrmidons fall in to them, and make them believe
they were of their profession, as indeed they were, but in another way; but one
of the Tories had a jealous mind that Hind was not a true Brother, whereupon
he asked him what he was: What am I, quoth Hind? A Brother of the Blade, and
that thou shall know before we part; therefore deliver, or believe it, this
sword shall speak other language then you expect. The Gentlemen were much
amazed at this unexpected answer; They asked him, what he meant? What do I
mean? I mean to try a touch whether or no that Money you have shall be yours or
ours; and to it they went; but Hind so played his game that he made them be glad
to be rid of him upon such conditions as he liked, and they disliked, which
was, to leave their Money behind them, and go home by the weeping cross, and
cry, O hone, O hone!

How Hind, having lost his horse, robbed a Countryman in Glocestershire, by
laughing.
Hind upon a time having lost his horse, meeting with a Countryman in
Glocestershire; the Countryman being a pretty nimble fellow got away from him:
but Hind he as cunning, seeing he could not overtake take him, fell a laughing
heartily, which made the Country-fellow return; thinking him to be some old
acquaintance of his grown out of remembrance, that in jest had pursued him,
returned back toward him; still Hind laughed at his seeming acquaintance,
till the fellow came within danger, that he surprised him, and took ten pound
away from him, but gave him twenty shillings again, and told him, Believe me
not when I laugh again.

How Hind robbed a Butcher in Yorkshire, by drawing him from his Company by
discourse, and keeping pace with his horse.
Hind coming into Yorkshire in the West Riding, met with a company of
Butchers, which were going to a Fair to buy some Cattle; he hearing them
discourse of their business, and what each party had to bestow, he begins to
take acquaintance of the chiefest of them, and telling him he was of the same
fraternity, and in that he lied not, for he had been a Butcher, and therefore
could discourse exactly of their profession; so cunningly did he disguise his
knavery, and in his discourse being not mistrusted, he trotted pretty hard
before the rest; the Butcher whom he singled out strived to keep pace with him,
to hold discourse with him, till Hind seeing his opportunity, and being a
pretty way from the Company, said to the Butcher, Friend, I must require you to
deliver your purse; the Butcher denied: he presently presents his Pistol before
him, which startled the Butcher, and made him deliver his money unto him, the
sum being eighty pound, and so sent the Butcher to his fellows again.

How Hind, in the habit of a servingman, robbed a Traveller of 15.l. by laying
a Cloak-bag in the highway.
ALL Professors have some more excellent in the Art then another, and this
Hind he is in his profession, as sometimes he went in the habit of a Gentleman
of great fortunes, sometimes in poor habit, and sometimes in a serving-mans
habit: It fortuned, that lying in wait for some booty, sent out one of his gang
that laid a Cloak-bag in the highway, where Travelers must of necessity come
by, where one coming by, seeing the Cloak-bag lie in the way, lighted from his
horse, and went to take up the Cloak-bag; presently Hind steps to him, and
takes and robs him of fifteen pounds: this he did in the habit of a serving-man.

How Hind put a trick upon a Dutch Mountebank in Holland.
NOw Hind being in Holland, and wanting money, being in a strange Country, he
had nor that Command as he had in England, and to rob on the highway as in
England, hearing of a rich Mountebank that went about quacking of it, how he
went never without store of money, his name was Henrick van Veldes, he was
something fortunate in Cures, therefore by every one desired: this Mountebank
going to visit his sick Patients in diverse parts of the City, having received
diverse sums of money for his particular Cures, was watched by this Hind, and
as he passed through a by-street, he runs to him as in great haste, and salutes
him in a kind manner, thus; Sir, I have heard much of your renown in Cures of
dangerous consequence, and since it is my happiness to meet with you, I live
not far from this place, if you please to go along with me to my house, I have
a wife much troubled with a Flux in her belly for these fourteen days, and you
by your experience may do her much good, if you please to give her a visit; I
humbly request you to go along with me, and what content you desire, I shall
willingly satisfy. This Bell sounded well in his ears: well, he goes with
Hind to his lodging, and in the way he gives Hind comfortable answer, saying,
God forbid I should neglect that little skill I have to do your wife any good I
can: Upon these Complements Hind leads him from one street to another, till at
last he got him within his lodging, which was so contrived, that it was some
distance from other houses; having locked the door upon him, he takes in one
hand a Pistol, in the other a great empty purse, and furiously looking upon the
Mountebank, he said, Sir, here is my wife, (meaning the empty Purse,) she has
been a long time troubled with a Flux in her belly, and you are the only man
that can only remedy and find out a means to cure this disease; else I my
self, by the help of this pistol, am resolved to remedy it. This Mountebank
seeing himself thus cunningly and suddenly surprised, began suddenly to cry
out, but was presently silencd by the sight of the pistol, was fain for fear to
let go his own purse to cure that purse which had the flux; but according to
his wonted charity, seeing the man in this trembling condition, he restored him
some part of his Money again, promised to convey him to his Lodging, and did
with his pistol cockd, for fear of an outcry, and in the mid way left him and
his lodging both together.

How Hind and his Crew robbed a gentleman of whom he had borrowed money, and
how Hind released him again.
NOw Hind having been in distress, and borrowed Money of a Gentleman of his
acquaintance, who knew not his manner and course of life; it fortuned this
Gentleman traveling chanced to meet with this Hind and his Companions as he
was crossing a wood; he was set upon by them, and robbed of all his Money,
Besides, some of them were so cruel, that they would have killed him; but Hind
remembered his former courtesies, and told them, Friends, we will spare his
life, and provide for our own safety; So carrying him into a thicket, they
there tied him to the body of a tree, and so left him; but Hind spied his
opportunity, and bid the Gentleman not to fear, for he would come and release
him; so Hind and his Comradoes went their way, and parted their booty; but
after some time he returns, and unbinds him, and restores him his part of the
prize.

How Hind and his Comradoes robbed a company of Thieves of an hundred pounds.
THere was a certain Company of mad Blades, having spent their patrimony, the
next work they take in hand is, God dam them, they would go take a purse too,
to maintain them in their luxurious courses; and combined together to take the
next opportunity: So it was the ill fortune of a Gentleman in Lincolnshire to
be surprised by these Gallants of all his money; when they had their booty,
they went out of that County, and came to an Inn where Hind used to be; so
there they were very frollique and merry; and Hind observing their actions, he
stood where they were to go away, and which way they were to go, he takes Horse
with the rest of his Companions, and way lays them, and at the foot of an Hill
they bid them Stand, and deliver: The Youngsters were much startled at it, and
cry out, Why, we are your friends: What, Thieves fall out? We will fall in,
says Hind; and so fell upon them, and took all the money they robbed the
Lincolnshire Gentleman of, and their own, and left them, and away Hind crossed
the Country.

How Hind cozened an Innkeeper in Oxfordshire.
HInd had many shifts, when put to a pinch, he sent some of his Comrades in the
habit of Serving-men to take up lodging for their master in an Inn, telling the
Innkeeper there was a great Lord to lie there about some business for some
time, and wished him to provide the best cheer could be devized, for he cared
not for Butchers meat: and to color the business, he sent two great iron
chests bound and corded about, as if some rich treasure were in them, and gave
order they should be set in the best room in the house; so when the lodging was
fitted, the next day came in Hind like a great Lord, or Don of Spain, in his
coach, attended by two Lacquaies and two Serving-men, having extraordinary
respect from the Master of the house, and so continued for a certain time,
going in and out upon his robberies, but (having been there about a month,
paying for what he had) the Host mistrusted nothing, he coming in and out in
his coach in that manmer: Hind took an occasion to borrow threescore pounds of
his H^st, pretending some extraordinary business, and goes out in the morning
in his coach, but came in no more: his Host thought he had been gone into the
country and would return again, and consequently mistrusted not, because he
conceived he had so good a pledge: but after he had been about a month absent,
he made bold to open the chests, wherein was nothing but stones and brick-bats:
so Hind had royal entertainment and money to boot.

How Hind robbed a man and his wife near Burford, and took all their money from
them.
A Gentleman and his wife were traveling on their way to Burford, and Hind
understanding that he had store of money, he beset him, and bid him deliver his
purse; the Gentleman contested with him, with his sword drawn, Hind draws his
pocket pistol, and swore if he would not deliver he would pistol him: the
woman she cries out good husband deliver your money: the man what between Hinds
threats, and his wifes cries and entreaties, Hind had the money delivered unto
him: being a quarter of a mile off, the Gentleman comes into, and raises the
Town, but Hind was gone another way, and by the swiftness of his horse, got
clear from his pursuers.

How Hind escaped being closely followed with a Hue and Cry for a great robbery
that he had done in the habit of a Country Grasier.
HInd having done a great robbery in Darbyshire, and thinking himself secure,
betook himself to an Inn, which are as s^nctuaries to robbers; and staying
there somewhat longer then his time, he was pursued into the town by some
horsemen; he knowing the matter, got his horse out of the stable, and took a
back way, having on a gray coat in the habit of a Grasier: after he had been
some time gone, the pursuers had intelligence which way he went, his horse
being almost weary, they came within sight of him, and perceived him to take
into a field where were some horses at grass, in which he no sooner came but
he pulled off his saddle and bridle, and threw them into a ditch with his sword
and pistol, and turned up his horse to grass, pulled off his own coat and
turned it, which was black within, and with a Priests girdle he had in his
pocket girt it to him, taking a little book out of his pocket, and walking
under a hedge, as if he had been in study for a Sermon: this was no sooner
done, but his pursuers came to the place; seeing as they thought a Divine in
meditation, courteously desired of him if he saw any man come riding that way;
Yes quoth Hind, with much speed in a gray coat, and the color of his horse was
much like that yonder you see at grass, pointing to his own horse: he was the
man, quoth they, pray which way did he tak^? he took the hedge quoth H^nd; I
suppose if you ride hard you may take him e're he comes to the next Town; they
all gave him thanks, and with much speed hasted the way he directed them; when
they were gone, Hind laughed at their credulity, and taking his horse sadled
him again, and rode his way.

How Hind robbed a Gentleman of his Watch on the highway, and how friendly they
parted.
HInd, as his custom was, costing the Country, being never out of his way,
meets with a Gentleman; quoth Hind, pray Sir how far ride you this way? the
Gentleman answered to Coventry, I shall rejoice in your company, quoth Hind, I
thank you sir said the gentleman, for there is some danger in this rode, for
seldom a week passes but one or other is robbed near this place, but the best
on it is, I have no money to loose, if I can keep my Watch I care not, I have
been twice or thrice in danger of losing it already: Hind hearing that the
Gentleman had no money, thought it best to take what he could get, and look for
some other companion: I pray sir, quoth he, what time of the day think you it
is by your Watch? that you shall know presently, quoth the Gentleman, and
looking on the same, said it is near eleven? p^ay let me see, quoth Hind? the
Gentleman gave him the Watch into his hand, it is true indeed quoth Hind; and
putting the Watch into his pocket, said, I should have been ten miles off e're
this time, and you must mend your pace if you will keep me company; but howev^r
I shall have a care of your Watch that it take no hurt, for it never was in so
much danger: so he took his leave of the gentleman, and bid him tell his
friends he had been in the company of James Hind.

How Hind cheated a Lawyer of his Watch.
HInd meeting with a Lawyer in a Tavern near the road, fell into company and
were very merry together, Hind perceiving the Lawyer had a Watch in his pocket
(by the key and string hanging out) made bold with it, which the Lawyer soon
after missed and inquired after, wherup on Hind restored it to him again, with
this Poetical complement.

A Watch in Tavern lost?
Oh, that is a crime:
See how in drinking
men do lose their time:
The string hung out,
and you forgot to lock it,
And so the Watch
did slip out of your pocket.
If you would keep your Watch,
thus must you do;
Pocket your Watch,
but watch your pocket too.
FINIS.
