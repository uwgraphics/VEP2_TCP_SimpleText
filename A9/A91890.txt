A BRIEF CATECHISM CONCERNING CHVRCH-GOVERNMENT BY That Reverend Divine Mr.
JOHN ROBINSON, and may fitly be adjoined to Mr. PERKINS six Principles as an
Appendix thereto.

1 TIMOTHY 3. 14.These things I write hoping to come unto thee shortly. 1 TIMOTHY 3.
15.But if I tarry long, that thou may know how thou ought to behave thy
self in the house of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar
and ground of the truth.

LONDON, Printed in the year, 1642.

AN APPENDIX TO Mr. PERKINS HIS SIX PRINCIPLES Of Christian Religion.
UNTO the former Principles published by that Reverend man Mr. William Perkins,
fully containing what every Christian is to believe touching God and himself,
I have thought it fit for the good, especially of those over whom I am set,
(the younger sort of whom I have formerly catechized in private, according to
the same Principles) to annex a few other, touching the more solemn fellowship
of Christians, Rev. 2. 7. 2 Cor. 6. 16. Romans 9. 4. Act. 2. 47. Mat. 18. 17. 18.
20. 2 Cor. 6. 16.
the Church of God, as being a divine institution, the spiritual Paradise and
Temple of the living God; in which his most solemn Services are to be
performed: and to which he adds daily such as shall be saved; promising to
dwell in the midst of them by his most powerful and gracious presence.

Question. What is a Church?

Ans. A company of faithful and holy people (with their seed) called by the
Word of God into public covenant with Christ, and amongst themthemselves for
mutual fellowship in the use of all the means of Gods glory and their
salvation.

Qu Of what sort or number of people must this company consist?

A. It is all one whether they be high or low, few or many, so as they exceed
not such a number, as may ordinarily meet together in M. 3. 28. Matthew. 28. 17.
19.
one place for the worshipping of God, and sanctification of the Lords day.

Qu. What are the reasons why the Church must consist of faithful and holy
persons?

A. 1. First the 1 Cor. 11. 17. 18. 20. etc. 14. 23. Act. 20. 7.
Scriptures every where so teach.

2. The Levit. 20. 26. Romans 17. 8. 1 Cor. 1. 2. Phil. 1. 1. to verse. 9. ^h Eoh.
1 22. ^col. 1. 18.
Church is the body of Christ, all whose members therefore should be
conformable in some measure to him their head.

3 Only such John 4. 23 Prove. 15. 5. Hob, 8. 8. 10. etc.
worshippers please God as are accepted of him and have right to the covenant
of grace and seals thereof.

Qu But are not hypocrites mingled with the faithful in the Church?

A. None ought to be by the word of God: and where such are they are not truly
added by the Lord to the Church, but do Jude. v. 2. Eze. 44. 7.
creep in through their own hypocrisy, and not without the Churches sin
also, if they may be discerned to be such.

Qu. By what means is the Church gathered?

A. Mat. 28 19. 20. Act 2. 14. etc. and cap. 11. 19. 20. 21. Romans 1. 5. 1 Cor.
15. 1.
By the word preached and by faith received of them that hear it.

Qu. Is every believer a member of the visible Church?

A Act. 19. 1. and 5. 13 14.
No Act. 2. 21. 47. and Cap. 8. 37. and 19. 1. 9. 16. and 9. 26 27. Act. 17. 1,
2, 3, 4. with 1 These. 1. 1.
, but he must also by his personal and public profession adjoyne himself to
some particular fellowship and society of Saints.

Qu. How prove you the Seed of the faithful to be of the Church with them?

A. By the Genesis 17. 7. etc. Luke 1. 72. 73. Gal. 3. 8. 16, 17.
covenant which God made with Abraham and his seed: which was the covenant of
the Gospel and confirmed in Christ; the Rom 4. 11
seal thereof circumcision, being the seal of the righteousness of Faith.

Qu. What are the essential marks of the Church?

A. Col. 2. 5, 6. 1 Pet. 2. 5. with 5. 1. 2.
Faith and Order, as the Church in them may be scene and beheld to walk in
Christ Jesus whom she has received: Faith professed in word and deed, showing
the Matter to be true: and Order in the holy things of God, showing the Form
to be true, which are the two essential parts of the Church. As true matter
and Form, or two essential parts of other things. As of a house, Temple,
Tabernacle. Exodus 2. 6. 1. to 7.


Qu. Are not the preaching of the word and administering of the Sacraments
certain marks of the true Church?

A. No: for the word may (and that rightly) be preached to assemblies of
unbeleevers for their conversion Mat. 28. 19. Mar. 16. 15. Act. 14. 7. 14. and
17. 22. etc.
: as may the Sacraments also (though unjustly) be administered unto them Genesis
34. 24. Sichemites. 2 Kings 17. 25. 27. etc. Hos. 1. 9. with Psalm. 50. 16. Romans
9. 4. 5.
, and so be made sying signs. Besides, the true Church may for a time want the
use of diverse ordinances of God, but has always right unto them; as may also
the false Church usurp and abuse them but without right.

Qu. What are the means in and by which Christ and the Church have fellowship
together?

A. 1 Cor. 12. 3. 4. 5. 6.
1. In the gifts of the Spirit of Christ. 2. In the offices of ministry given
to the Church. 3. In the works done in and by those gifts and offices.

Qu. Wherein stands this communion of the Spirit?

A. Ephesians. 2. 12. and chap. 4. 15. 16. Col. 3. 19.
In the in-dwelling and operation of the gifts and graces thereof conveyed from
Christ as the head, unto the Church as his body, and members one of another:
Whence arises that most streit and divine conjunction, by which, as by the
civil bond of marriage, the man and wife are one flesh: so they who are thus
joined to Christ are one spirit 1 Cor. 6. 17. Ephesians. 5. 23. to 30, 31, 32.
.

Qu. How many are the offices of ministry in the Church?

A. Five: (besides the extraordinary offices of Apostles, Prophets and
Evangelists, for the first planting of the Churches, which are ceased, with
their extraordinary gifts.)

Qu. How is that proved?

A. Partly by the Romans 12 7. 8. 1 Ti. 3. 1. 8 with 5. 3. 9. 17.
Scriptures, which both mention them expressly, and describe them by their
principal gifts, and works: and partly by Reason agreeable to the Scriptures.

Qu. Show me which those officers be, with their answerable gifts and works.

A. 1. Ephesians. 4. 11. Or the Exhorter. Romans 12. 8. Or the Exhorter. 1 Cor. 12. 8
Romans 12. 7. 1 Timothy 5. 17.
The Pastor, to whom is given the gift of wisdom for exhortation. 2. The
Teacher, to whom is given the gift of knowledge for doctrine. 3. The governing
Elder, who is to rule with diligence. 4. The Deacon, who is to administer the
holy treasure with simplicity. 5. The Widow, or Deaconesse, who is to attend
the sick and impotent, with compassion and cheerfulness. Act. 6. 1. 3 1 Timothy
3. 8. ^0. and cap. 5. 3. 9. 10. Romans 16. 1.


Qu. What is the Reason for the proving of these ministeries?

A. Because all these are useful and necessary, and these alone sufficient for
the Church; as being the most perfect society and 1 Cor. 12. 27. Ephesians. 12. 12.
(...) verse. 19. (...).
body of Christ, which neither fails in that which is necessary, nor
exceeds in any thing superfluous.

Qu. Whence arises the usefulness and sufficiency of these ministeries in the
Church?

A. From the condition partly of the souls, and partly of the bodies of the
members.

Qu. How does that appear?

A. 1. In the soul is the faculty of understanding, about which the Teacher
is to be exercised Romans 12. 7. 8.
for information by doctrine. 2. The will and affections: upon which the Or
Exhorter, Ibidem.
Pastor is especially to work by exhortation and comfort. 3. Because that
doctrine and exhortation without obedience, are unprofitable, the diligence of
the ruling Elder is requisite for that purpose.

Qu. How are the other two Ministeries to be exercised?

A. As the Church consists of men, and Act. 6. 1. 3 and 4. 35. Gal. 6. 6.
(...). 1 Timothy 5. 18.
they of souls and bodies, so are the Deacons out of the Churches treasure,
and contribution to provide for the common uses of the Church, relief of the
poor, and maintenance of the Officers; as are the widows to afford unto the
sick and impotent in body (not able otherwise 1 Timothy 5. 3. 9.
to help themselves) their cheerful and comfortable service.

Qu. Wherefore call you those Offices by the name of Ministeries, or Services?

A. For two causes: 1. For that they are no Lordships, but services of Christ,
and of the Mat. 20. 25, 26, 27. 2 Cor. 4. 5. 1 Cor. 4. 1. and cap. 3. 21, 22,
23.
Church.

2. Because they consist in administering only of those things which are
Christ's, and the Churches under him.

Q. By whom are these Officers to have their outward calling?

A. By the Church whereof they are members for the present, and to which they
are to administer.

Q. How does that appear?

A. 1. The Apostles who taught only Christ's Commandments, so directed the
Churches Act. 1. 15. 23. and cap. 6. 1. 2. 3. 5. and cap. 14. 23. Greek. Act.
1. 21. and 6. 3. 1 Timothy 3. 2, 3, 4, 5.
.

2. The people amongst whom they have been conversant can best judge of their
fitness, both in respect of their Persons and families.

3 It furthereth much the diligence and saithfulnesse of the Minister, that
they whose Minister he is have freely chosen him, as unto whom under Christ
they commit the most precious treasure of their soul: as also it binds Heb.
13. 17.
the people to greater love and conscience of obedience of him and his
ministry, whom themselves have made choice of.

4. The Church being a most free Corporation spiritual under Christ the Lord,
is in Ephesians. 2. 12. 19.
all reason and equity to choose her ministers and 1 Co. 12. 27. 2 Cor. 4, 5. 1 Timothy 5. 17 18. 1 Cor. 9. 7. 9. Heb. 5. 4, 5
servants under him unto whom also she is to give wages for their service and
labor.

Qu. Is this outward calling of simple necessity for a true Church officer?

A. Yea, as for the Magistrate in the City and Commonwealth; or steward in the
family: without which they usurp their places, how excellent soever, whether in
their gifts or works.

Q. What if the Officer be found unfaithful in his place?

A. He is by the Church to be warned to take heed to his ministry he has
received, to fulfill it; which if he neglect to do, by the same power which
set him up, he is to be Col. 4. 17
put down and deposed. Being dealt with as a Brother, Math. 18. 15. 17.


Q. What are the outward works of the Churches communion with Christ

A. These six: 1. Prayer. 2. the reading and opening of the Word. 3. the
Sacraments. 4. singing of Psalms. 5. Censures. 6. contribution to the
necessity of the Saints.

Qu. Wherefore put you prayer in the first place?

A. Because by it all the rest are sanctified to the faithful. For prayer see
the end of the 1. Tim. 2. 1. and 4, 5.
fifth Principle with the exposition: only add this, that in the act of our
speaking unto God by prayer, we are not to use the help of Jude verse. 20.
Zach. 12. 10. Romans 8. 15. 26.
any book, beads, crucifixes or the like, to teach or provoke us, but only
the help of the spirit of adoption, and prayer, working in our hearts
effectually, and teaching us both what and how to pray as we ought.

Qu. What believe you touching the word?

A. Besides the things observed in the fifth Principle and Exposition; that the
whole written Word, and it alone is to be read and opened in the Church.

Qu. Wherefore are the whole Scriptures to be read and opened?

A. Prove. 30. 5. Romans 15. 4. 2 Timothy 3. 16
Because the whole Word of God is pure, written for our learning and comfort,
given by divine inspiration, and is profitable for doctrine, reproof,
correction and instruction, and from which nothing may be Deuteronomy. 4. 2. Rev. 21.
19.
diminished,

Qu. How prove you that the Scriptures only are to be read, and opened in the
Church?

A. s Because they alone are sufficient for faith, 2 Romans 16, 17. Heb. 11. 6.
Ioh. 20. 31. 2. Tim. 3. 16, 17.
and the obedience which is of Faith, and able to make the man of God perfect,
thoroughly furnished unto all good works, and unto which nothing may Prove. 30.
6. Deuteronomy. 4. 3. Rev. 21. 19.
be added.

Qu. Who are to open and apply the Scriptures in the Church?

A. Principally the Bishops or Act. 20 17, 28. Tit 1. 5, 7.
Elders, who by the Word of life are to feed the flock, both in teaching and
government. Secondly, such as are out of office, in the exercise of Prophecy.

Qu. How is that exercise proved in the Scriptures?

A. By Luke 2: 42. 46, 47, and cap. 4. 16, 17, 18. Act. 8, 4, and cap. 11. 19,
20, 21, and cap. 13, 14, 15, 16. and cap. 18. 24, 25, 26.
examples in the Jewish Church, where men though in no office, either in Temple
or Synagogue, had liberty publicly to use their gifts.

2 Luke 9. 1. and cap. 10. 1. g Romans 2. 6. 1, Pet. 4. 10, 11. 1. Cor. 14. 1.
By the Commandment of Christ and his Apostles.

3 By the prohibiting of 1. Tim. 2. 11, 12, 1, Cor, 14. 34, 35. 11. Pet. 4. 10,
11.
women (not extraordinarily inspired) to teach in the Church: herein liberty
being given unto men their husbands, or others.

4 By the excellent ends, which by this means are to be obtained: as 1 These.
5. 19. 1 Timothy 3. 2. 1 Cor. 14. 35.
The glory of God in the manifestation of his manifold graces. 2. That the
gifts of the spirit in men be not quenched. 3. For the fitting and trial of
men for the Ministry. 4. For the preserving pure of the doctrine of the
Church, which is more endangered, if some one or two alone may only be heard,
and speak. 5. For debating and satisfying of doubts, if any do arise. 6. For
the edifying of the Church, and conversion of others.

Qu. Who is a Prophet in this sense?

A. He that has the gift of the spirit to speak Act. 2, 42. Luke 4. 22, 23.
1. Cor. 14. 4. 24, 25. 1 Cor. 14. 3. 37. Act. 13. 15.
unto edification, exhortation and comfort.

Qu. What is the order of this exercise?

A. That it be performed after the public Ministry by the teachers, and
under their direction and moderation: whose duty it is, if any thing be obscure
to open it: if doubtful to clear it: if unsound to refuse it: if unperfit to
supply what is wanting, as they are able.

Qu. What believe you touching the Sacraments further then is observed in the
former Principles?

A. That they are to be dispensed according to the tenure of the Covenant of
grace, whereof they are seals: in respect both of the persons to whom, and of
the ends for which they are to be administered.

Qu. Which are those persons?

Genesis 17. 7. 1 Cor. 7, 14.
A. The faithful and their seed.

Qu. May all the faithful partake in the Sacraments?

A. Act, 2, 41, 42. 47. Act. 5. 13. 14, Rom, 9. 4, Deuteronomy. 12, 5, 13.
No, except they be also added to some particular congregation, unto which the
public ordinances and Ministry does appertain.

Qu Which are the ends and uses of the Sacraments?

A. The first is from God to the Church, opened in the exposition of the fifth
Principle, where it is showed what a Sacrament is. The Genesis 17, 9, 10.
second is from the Church to God, in which it testifies the acceptance of the
Covenant, and binds it self to the performance of the conditions. The third
is in respect of the members themselves mutually, as being badges 1 Cor, 12,
13. Judge. 14. 4.
of their association. The fourth in respect of all other Assemblies, Judge. 14.
4.
between whom and the Churches, they are notes of distinction.

Qu. What is required touching singing of Psalms in ^he Church?

A. That they be such as are parts of the word of God, formed by the Holy Ghost
into Math, 26, 30. Ephesians. 5, 19. Col. 3. 16.
Psalms or Songs, which many may conveniently sing together, exhorting and
admonishing themselves mutually with grace in their hearts.

Qu. What believe you touching the censure of excommunication?

A. That it is to be used by every particular Church, according to the rules of
Christ.

Qu. How prove you this power to be in every particular congregation?

A. 1. By the donation and gift of Christ the Lord. 2. The particular Church of
Corinth Math. 18. 17, 18, 19. 1 Cor. 5. Rev. 2, and 3.
had this power, for the neglect whereof it is reproved by the Apostle. 3.
Every particular Church has right to the Word, Sacraments and Prayer, within
it self, which are greater, and therefore to this which is lesser then they.

Qu. What are the rules of Christ for excommunication?

A. 1. The sin thus to be censured must be Math. 18. 15. 1 Cor. 5. 11. Math.
18. 15, 16, 17. 19. 1 Cor, 5. 4. 5. 11.
scandalous, and the person obstinate after due conviction and patience used.

2. The Church excommunicating must be that particular congregation gathered
together in the name of Christ, whereof the sinner is a member.

Qu. How prove you that by the Church Math. 18. is not meant the Bishop, or
Presbytery representing the body?

A. 1. One man cannot be a Church, which as Christ teaches, verse. 19. 20. must
be a company, how small soever, gathered together in his name.

2. The word there used never signifies in the Scriptures, an Officer or
Officers, excluding the people.

3. The Apostle 1. Cor. 5. expounds Christ's meaning to be of the whole body
come together.

4. The Elders being public Officers, are to exercise the solemn works of
their Office, and particularly the work of rebuking them that sin, openly
and before the Church, both that others may fear, and the Church of Faith 1 Timothy 5. 20.
consent to the excommunication: and therefore cannot represent the Church
being actually present.

5. A Representative Church in a case of faith and conscience without the
consent of the represented in the particular decree establishes the Popish
doctrine of implicit Faith.

Qu. What is the order of proceeding in this Censure?

A. That the Brother offending privately be admon^shed privately, and after
(without his Mat. 18. 15.
repentance) with a witness or two who may give testimony both of the offense
and admonition and lastly, that by the brother admonishing with his witnesses,
the sinner (remaining obstinate,) complaint be made to the Church: which last
complaint alone is sufficient in public offenses.

Qu. What Order is to be observed after complaint thus made?

A. The Elders as the governors of the Church, are by the Scriptures clearly
to convince, and seriously to admonish and exhort the offender: and upon his
impenitency (with due conviction and patience:) to decree against him the
sentence of Excommunication: and lastly, with the peoples free consent to
pronounce and execute the same.

Qu. How appears the necessity of this ordinance?

A. Many ways. 1. By the commandment of Christ, and practice of the
Apostolical Mar. 18. 15 1 Cor. 5. 4.
Churches.

2. For the glory of Christ, which is much impeached by the profaneness of
those who profesle Romans 2. 24.
his service.

3. For the humbling of the sinner, and for the salvation of his soul. 1 Cor.
5. 5. verse. 7. 8.


4. To prevent the infection of others. Heb. 12. 15.


5. That by the zeal and holiness of the Church, they without may be gained
to the Gospel.

Qu. How is the Church to walk toward a person excommunicated?

A. So as they may make him ashamed by 2 These. 3. 6. 11.
withdrawing from him in all spiritual Communion, and civil familiarity also,
so far as may be, without the violation of any natural 1 Cor. 5. 11
or civil bond.

Q What is to be observed for the Churches contribution?

A. That in their public meeting every 1 Cor. 16. 1.
first day of the week, they contribute, as God has prospered them, to the
public Treasury, by the Deacons to be received and distributed, as there is
need, to the relief of the poor, maintenance Act. 5. 1. Gal. 6. 10. Romans 15.
26.
of the Ministry, and other necessary uses of the Church first, and after of
others also, as need requires.

And whosoever will walk according to this rule, peace be upon them, and
mercy, and upon the Israel of God, Galath. 6. 16. 1. CANT. 6, 7, 8. Look not
upon me because I am black, because the Sun has looked upon me: my mothers
Children were angry with me, they made me the keeper of the vineyards, but mine
own vineyard have I not kept. Tell me (O thou whom my soul loves) where thou
feedest, where thou make thy flock to rest at noone: for why should I be as
one that turns aside by the flocks of thy companions? If thou know not (O
thou fairest amongst women) go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock,
and feed thy kids beside the shepherds tents. Isa. 60. 12, 13. The Nation and
Kingdom that will not serve thee, shall perish. I will beautify the place of
my sanctuary, and will make the place of my feet glorious. Psalm. 27. 4. One
thing I asked, etc.
