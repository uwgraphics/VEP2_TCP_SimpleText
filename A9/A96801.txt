CHILDRENS BREAD.
CHAP. I. Of God, and of the Covenant of works.
Question.

HOw may a man find out the way to true happiness?

A Out of the sacred Scriptures, the old and new Testament, which are the rule
of faith, and manners, and able to make us wise to salvation, 2 Timothy 3.15.
Eccles. 12.10. Gal. 6.16. Romans 10.14. Psalm. 12.6.

Q How does the Scripture hold forth this unto us?

A. By teaching us the knowledge of God and his Covenant

Q What does the Scripture hold forth concerning God?

A. First, that God is a Spirit, having his eternal being from himself, and
is to be worshipped in spirit, and truth.

Secondly, That God is one in his Essence, and distinguished into three
Persons; the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, Deuteronomy. 6.4. 1 Cor. 8.4. Matthew.
28.19. 1. Job. 5.7.

Q What else?

A. First, the property of the Father, is to beget the Son; the property of
the Son, is to be begotten of the Father; the property of the holy Ghost, is to
proceed from the Father and the Son.

Secondly, that these three are equal in power, wisdom, immensity, eternity,
and all other Attributes, Exodus 34.6. Romans 16.27. Job. 35.7.

Q What does the Scripture declare concerning the Covenant?

A. That man's way to true happiness, before and since the fall, has been by a
way of Covenanting.

Q What was the first Covenant?

A. It was a Covenant of works, contained in the ten Commandments, which were
written in man's heart, binding him to perfect, and perpetual obedience.

Q What was man's condition under the first Covenant?

A. First, He was holy created after Gods Image, in wisdom, righteousness,
and true holiness, Genesis 1.26. Col. 3.10. Ephesians. 4.24.

Secondly, He was happy, in that he had communion with God, a quiet conscience,
dominion over the Creatures, and all the contents of Paradise, Genesis 1.29. and
2.15, 16, 17. Psalm. 8.6.

Q. Why then was there necessity of another Covenant?

A. Because man being enticed by the Devil, did wilfully, and wantonly break
the first Covenant, and thereby brought on himself, and on his posterity the
blot and guilt of sin, Lev 5.2, 3. Romans 3.9. 1 Cor. 15.17.

Q What harm comes by the blot of sin?

A. Loss of man's original beauty, in his aversion from God, and pronenesse to
all sin, in thought, word, and deed, Matthew. 15.11. Revel. 22.11. Isa. 1.15.

reprobate sense, and strong delusions, Luke 19.41, 42. Mat. 27.3. Romans 1.28. 1
These. 2.10, 11.

13.40. Jude. 13.

CHAP. II. Of the new Covenant, and of the Mediator of it.

God and lost man, through the mediation of Jesus Christ, 2 Cor. 5.18. Isa.
28.16. Luke 22.20.

Q. How is Jesus Christ our Mediator?

purposes, John 13.34. 1 John 4.11.

righteous by faith in Christ, it does not condemn, Romans 8.34.

Covenant, but as an Appendix thereunto, Luke 1.75.

Q How prove you that the moral Law is not abolished?

A. Because Christ expounds, urges, and confirms the Law, Matthew. 5.18, 19,
20, 21. Matthew. 15.4. Secondly, because faith does establish it, Romans 3.31. 1
Cor. 7 19. Gal. 3.17.

bin to no end, had the Law been abolished, Gal 3.17, 18, 19, 20.

Christ, the same spirit, and the same faith, John 19.25. Genesis 49.10. Ezekiel.
36.26. 1 Cor. 10.4.

But secondly; There was a graduall distinction, they saw Christ in the shadow,
and but darkly; but we with open face, and in the light; they believed in the
Messiah to come, and we, in Christ already come, Heb 13.8. 1 Cor. 3.18.

Q Are we in Covenant so soon as we are elected?

and keeping Covenant with God, Romans 8.29.
