VANITY OF VANITIES OR SIR HARRY VANE'S PICTURE.
To the Tune of the JEWS Corant.
HAve you not seen a Barthol'mew Baby
A Pageant of policy as fine as may be,
That Is gone to be Shown at the Manor of Raby,
Which no body can deny.
There was never such a prostitute Sight,
That e're profaned this purer Light,
A Hocus Pocus juggling Knight,
Which no body can deny.
He was taken for a Delphick Tripus,
Another doubt-solving Oedipus,
But the Parliament made him a very Quibus,
Which no body, etc.
His cunning State tricks and Oracles,
His lying wonders and Miracles,
Are turned into Parliament Shackles,
Which no body, etc.
Goodly great Sir Onesimus VANE,
The Anointed King of Saints not Reign?
I see all Godliness is not Gain,
Whhno od y, etc.
John a Leyden that Munsters Jing,
Was a Fool and an Ass to this pretty Thing,
But the Parliament hated the name of a King,
Which no body, etc.
This holy Saint has prayed till he wept,
Prophesied and Divined while he slept,
But fell in a T -- when aside he stepped,
Which no body, etc.
He sat late in the House so discontent,
With his Arms folded and his Brows bent,
Like Achitophel to the Parliament,
Which no body, etc.
He durst not speak of a Concubine,
Nor gave more Council to any Design,
But was musing on a Hempen Line,
Which no body, etc.
He see Mr. Prin take a great deal of Pain,
To get in with the rest as Members Again,
But they were Voted as use-lesse as VANE,
Which no body, etc.
They gave him a Conge with such a Vote;
'Twas thought they had learned it by Rote,
Ever since he went down to Graves-end by Bote,
Which no body, etc.
For all his Ceremonious Cringing,
He shall undergo a notable Swindging,
There is now no more need of his Engine,
Which no body, etc.
When first the English War began,
His Father was a Court Trepan,
And 'rose to be a Parliament Man,
Which no body, etc.
So from the Father came unto the Son,
Whom Woe and Misery now do wait upon,
For Counselling Protector John,
Which no body, etc.
A Gemini they were, Pollux and Castor,
One was a Teacher the other a Pastor,
And both like R -- betrayed their Master,
Which no body, etc.
The Devil never see such two Sir Harry's,
Such a pest'lent pair nor near nor far is,
No not at the Jesuits Sorbon of Paris,
Which no body, etc.
They talked of his having a Cardinals Hat,
They Would send him as soon an Old Nuns Twat,
For turning in pan there was never such a Cat,
Which no body, etc.
His dainty project of a Select Senate,
Is Damned for a blasphemous Tenet,
It Was found in the budget ('it is said) of Monk Bennet,
Which no body, etc.
Of this State and Kingdoms he is the Bane,
He shall have the reward of Judas and Cain,
And 'twas he that overthrew Charles his Wain,
Which no body, etc.
Should he sit where he did with his Mischievous brain,
Or if any his Councels behind do remain,
The house may be called the Labor in Vain,
Which no body can deny.
