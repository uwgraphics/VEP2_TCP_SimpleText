THE Welsh-Mens GLORY, OR, The Famous Victories of the Ancient BRITAINS
Obtained upon St. DAVID's Day.
THe Honor, Glory and the Grace
Of Valiant Brute's Tryumphant race,
Showing the Reasons, wherefore they
Wear Leeks upon St. David's Day.
The Valiant Deeds of Britain's bold,
I here shall sing in Verse,
Direct my Pen, Heroic Muse,
While I the same rehearse.
That to the Britains Noble Fame,
I bravely chant it may,
The reason why, they do wear LEEKS
Upon St. David's Day.
I mean not to relate the Deeds
Of Warlike Valiant GUY
Nor England's Warwick Champion,
Saint GEORGE's Chivalry;
Nor any other Warriers Fame,
Intend I to display,
But what the Britains bold, have done
Upon St. David's Day.
Cold Winter with his Frosty Face
Does bid you all farewell;
And Manly March, has taken place,
A month with you to dwell:
Brother to sweet April Showers,
And Usher to fair MAY,
And in his Hat a LEEK he wears
Upon St. David's Day.
Against Britain when the Romans did
Their Warlike Ensigns bear,
Instead of Plumes, the green top LEEKS
Brute's Valiant Race did wear,
Who bravely from the Roman Troop,
The Conquest bore away
Which Badge of Honor still they wear
Upon St. David's Day.
And though stout Caesar, with his Force
Did strongly invade their Land,
The Britains bold, with Foot and Horse
His Power did withstand,
And when of them, he tribute sought,
They did refuse to pay,
For which they still do wear a LEEK
Upon St. David's day.
The Saxons entered afterward,
And Essex did obtain,
And with an Army well prepared,
The Kingdom for to Gain;
Each Town and City went to wrack
Where the Saxons bore the sway,
At length the Britains drove them back
Upon St. David's Day.
They being led by that brave Prince,
King Arthur called by Name,
Whose Power with his Valiant Knights
The Saxons pride did tame.
In twelve Battles them did overthrow,
As Chronicles does say,
The last of which, the Britains overcame
Upon St. David's Day.
Next after that the Lances came in,
That great nerping Foe,
At Winchels^y, They did begin
The Land to overthrow;
Till Captain Landaff, a BRITAIN true,
Did make their Lives decay,
And Conquered the Danish Crew,
Upon St. David's Day.
When Crook-back Richard, wore the Crown
As Regent of this Land;
No Policy could put him down,
Nor his proud Power withstand:
Till Henry Richmond, entered Wales,
Whom BRITAINS did obey,
And Conquered in Bosworth-Field,
Upon St David's Day.
The Warlike Deeds which late have been,
By Valiant Welsh-Men shown,
Both England, France, and Germany,
And other Lands have known;
Whose Honor with Tryumphant Praise,
Fames Trumpet does display,
And Blazen still their Noble Acts
Upon St. David's Day.
Then does not our St. DAVID's day,
Well Merit to be Famed;
VVhereon the most Tryumphant Brute's
Their mighty Foes have tamed,
And have so well behaved themselves,
That I may boldly say,
The like was never yet performed
Upon St. David' s Day.
Of James the Spaniard Boast,
Saint Denis stands for France;
Saint Patrick in the VVestern Coast,
The Irish Men advance;
George holds the Sword, David the Scales
Where Justice bears the sway,
And England Drinks a Health to Wales
Upon St. David' s Day.
The BRITAINS have been ever true,
And dares for to oppose,
Both Pagans, Infidels and Jews,
And all that are our Foes;
And will maintain their Countries good,
Which never will decay,
Then blessing be on all their Names,
That Love Saint David' s Day.
And to Conclude, my new made Song,
I wish with all my Heart,
That they may never suffer wrong,
That take the Welsh-Mens part;
Who stand up for their Countries right,
As Lawfully they may,
And wear the LEEK as their delight
Upon St. David's Day.
Entered according to Order.
