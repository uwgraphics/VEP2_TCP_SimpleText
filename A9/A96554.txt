His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT, On Tuesday
the Seventh Day of November, 1693.
I Am always Glad to meet you here, and I could heartily wish that Our
Satisfaction were not lessened at present by Reflecting upon the Disadvantages
We have received this Year at Land, and the Miscarriages in Our Affairs at Sea.
I Think it is Evident, That the former was only occasioned by the great Number
of Our Enemies, which exceeded Ours in all Places; For what relates to the
latter, which has brought so great a Disgrace upon the Nation, I have Resented
it extremely, and as I will take Care, that those who have not done their Duty,
shall be punished, so I am Resolved to use My utmost Endeavors, that Our Power
at Sea may be rightly Managed for the Future. And it will well Deserve your
Consideration, Whether We are not Defective both in the Number of Our Shipping,
and in proper Ports to the Westward, for the better Annoying Our Enemies, and
Protecting our Trade, which is so Essential to the Welfare of this Kingdom.

My Lords and Gentlemen,

I Am very sensible of the good Affection wherewith you have always assisted
me, to Support the Charges of this War, which have been very Great, and yet I
am persuaded that the Experience of this Summer is sufficient to Convince Us
all, that to arrive at a good End of it, there will be a Necessity of
Increasing Our Forces both by Sea and Land the next Year. Our Allies have
Resolved to add to Theirs, and I will not Doubt, but you will have such Regard
to the present Exigency, as that you will give Me a suitable Supply to Enable
Me to do the like. I must therefore earnestly Recommend it to you, Gentlemen of
the House of Commons, to take such timely Resolution, as that your Supplies may
be Effectual, and Our Preparations so Forward, as will be Necessary both for
the Security and the Honor of the Nation.
