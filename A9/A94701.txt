To the Supreme Authority of this Nation, the Commons of England in Parliament
Assembled.
The Humble Petition of the Creditors of Sir Peter Temple, Knight and Baronet;
whose names are hereunder written.
Humbly shows,
THat the said Sir Peter Temple, being many years since indebted to the
Petitioners in the several debts in the Schedule annexed, amounting to above
20000 l. and having a real Estate in Lands to the value of about 4000 l. per
annum, and great store of woods upon those Lands to the value of 10000 l. at
the least: And nevertheless intending to defraud his Creditors, of their said
debts (a great part whereof is Orphans portions) And being a Member of this
House, and having thereby protected his person, and Estate, he has ever since
refused to pay his debts, and has not paid consideration for the same, and
when he discovered, that this Honorable House was inclined to make the Estates
of the Members thereof liable to the payment of their debts for releif of the
Subject, then the said Sir Peter still to protect his Estate, made a secret
conveyance of all his Estate, Rents and Revenues to some of his own special
friends, (that is to say) to the Lord Savile and others, and to that conveyance
annexed a Schedule of pretended debts, to be paid by the said Trustees forth of
the said Rents. Of which debts some were real, some were fained, But these
Petitioners, are by the said fraudulent Deed barred of their remedy against
the said Estate, and these Petitioners are like to be all defrauded, unless
they be relieved by the present Justice of this Honorable Assembly.

For remedy herein, and forasmuch as the Lands of the said Sir Peter Temple are
entailed, and in case the said Sir Peter should happen to dye before provision
made, for payment of the said Debts, the Petitioners would be altogether
remediless, and for as much as he stands out lawed after Judgment, for
several of the said Debts.

The Petitioners humbly pray that this practice of the said Sir Peter Temple
(tending to the ruin of many of the Petitioners) may not be made use of, to
the defeating of the Petitioners of their just Debts, but that such part of the
said Lands and Woods may be sold for the speedy payment of the said just
debts, as to your Wisdoms and Justice shall seem meet.
