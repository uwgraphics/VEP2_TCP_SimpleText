The profitable INTELLIGENCER, Communicating his Knowledge for the General
good of the Commonwealth and all Posterity. Containing many rare Secrets and
Experiments (having reference to a larger Book) which being well observed, and
industriously practiced, according to the Directions therein by all the
Inhabitants of England in general, will recover the Wealth of the Kingdom now
so miserably wasted by these unnatural Wars, and make it the most flourishing
Country in the world, and cause more naked to be clothed, more hungry to be
fed, more poor Virgins to be preferred in marriage, more sick to be healed,
then Suttons Hospital; the Savoy, and all the Hospitals and liberal Gifts in
England have ever performed, by certain ways which require no charge nor
labor, but what every active person shall be double paid for
A Copy of the Letter, wherein the Discourse entitled, Mercurius Laetificans,
was sent enclosed to the Authors most worthy, and highly honored Friend, Mr.
Samuel Hartlib.
SIR,
YOur cordial love to the Kingdoms good, being so clearly expressed to the
world, not only by your pen, but also by your constant practice in promoting
of all good designs, which tend to the general good of the Commonwealth,
has emboldned me to send you this enclosed Copy, desiring that you will be
pleased to take care, that it may be forthwith Printed, and published, together
with this Letter, which may be all contrived into one sheet of paper, if the
Printer he skillful: neither the Printer needs to fear any loss, nor you any
dishonor by promoting of this laudible design: for I have showed the Copy to
the learned, as well as the unlearned, to the rich as well as the poor, and
all approve of it, and desire to have it as soon as it shall be published: they
think it is a fine experiment to make good bread of an old shoe: and though
they differ in opinion concerning other affairs, yet they all love to eat bread
with one consent; and if they shall agree to practice according to their
profession, which is to do their best endeavors to further the good of the
public, then certainly, the cards will turn, and we shall all win our money
again by concord, which we have lost by discord, yea and twice as much more.
And though many of these things which I would have to be put to the best uses,
seem to be trivial, that is for want of understanding in the Readers; for in
Genoa as I have been credibly informed, it is an usual practice, to buy barren
land for little or nothing, and to carry good earth to it, and cover it so
deep, as a spade or a plough may work upon it; but this practice would never
countervail the first charge, unless they did usually practice another strange
work, which is so common there, that if an horse, or a beast do dung in any
street, or highway, it is a marvel if some boy or girl do not take it up,
before it be cold, so careful are they, that the fertility of the Kingdom
should not be diminished: And though these boys, and girls get nothing but
pinnes and points, or some other trifles, yet in the general the whole
Country is made rich, and plentiful: Even as we see in a Bee-hive, though
every Be bring but a drop of honey at a time, yet it makes up a weighty
mass, and many of those masses put together, do make up the great mass, which
I have seen at Sturbridge Fair, which is able to amaze a man, that beholds
it.

When this Book is published, then I desire you to think of the best way you
can possibly imagine, that all the Inhabitants of the whole Kingdom may have
knowledge of it generally; for knowledge that concerns the public good,
ought not to be concealed in the breasts of a few. As for the large Book, to
which this little one has relation, there is no thinking of publishing of it,
till we have obtained a Committee to examine witnesses, and to print their
Depositions in it: for Project^rs have cast so many bitter things into the
public Fountain, whereof all have drunk, and their minds are so poisoned, that
there is no other way to unpoyson them, but to win their belief and
willingness to practice, by such depositions of Gentlemen of quality, which
know the same as well as I my self, and some of them have taught me, and I have
taught others several Secrets, and some few I know my self still, and no man
else in the Kingdom, for ought that can be proved; all which reserved Knowledge
in particular Breasts is against the Wealth of the Public, and therefore ought
to be made common to all, or else this Design cannot prosper, nor the Kingdom
flourish according to my desire. As for your particular Encouragement I need
say no more, but that by furthering of this friendly Advertisement, and the
perfecting of the Books to which it belongs, you shall become a Furtherer of
the most Charitable Design that is now on foot in England, besides the great
and manifold Benefit that shall redound thereby to the Commonwealth. For I
dare undertake that by the right Improvement of the several Directions and
Experiments that shall be discovered, you shall undoubtedly cause more naked to
be clothed, more hungry to be fed, more poor Virgins to be preferred in
marriage, then Suttons Hospital, the Savoy, or all the Hospitals or Liberal
Gifts in England have ever performed. So I rest,

Your Bounden Servant, Gabriel Plattes.
Westminster this 14. of May. 1644.

WHen I perused the several Mercuries which go abroad, to wit, Mercurius
Civicus, Merc. Aulicus, Merc. Britanicus, Merc. Coelicus, Merc. Veridicus,
Mercurius Vapulans, etc. I was sorry that so much Wit, Labor and Study should
be so slighted, and produce no better effect; for I have seen them before they
were a week old, to be carelessly hurled up and down, and sometimes torn in
pieces to light Tobacco, and other uses not fit to be named. Whereupon I
resolved to try a Conclusion, to write a Mercury that no man should so abuse,
but he that is an enemy to himself, and to the Commonwealth. And therefore I
have ordered the matter so, that no man in the Kingdom, which has so much
learning as to read it, or so much understanding as to hear it read with
attention, but he may learn to gain a thousand times the price of it to
himself, besides the general good to the Public. But before I tell my Readers
what lasting and particular Benefit they are to expect, if they will follow
those Directions which shall be given them by the following Discourse: Let all
men that love themselves, or the Commonwealth, and Posterity, take special
notice of a certain Book of Husbandry, entitled, The Treasure House of Nature
unlocked, and set wide open to the world, etc. where they may plainly see, that
as God is infinite, and men are infinite by propagation, so the fruits of the
Earth for their food, and clothing are infinite, if men will consent to put to
their helping hands to this commendable Design.

The sum of the Book consists in showing how this Kingdom may maintain
double the number of people which it does now, and in far greater plenty:
But whereas the price will be five shillings, and every man's purse is not
troubled with superfluity of Crowns, whom it concerns; To the end that no
man be discouraged, I intend to give a Book to every public Library in the
Kingdom, where any man may read it, and write out what he pleases freely.
Also I intend as soon as it shall be printed, that in Westminster Hall, and
elsewhere at certain Signs then to be set up, the said Book shall be sold for
five shillings, or lent for two pence a week, to every one that shall leave the
money, or put in security to return it safe to the owner.

The reason why it is not already printed, is for that it contains many rare
Secrets for the Health and Wealth of Men, and such as will seem so strange, and
incredible to most men, that they will be likely to slight it, to the great
prejudice of the Commonwealth.

Whereupon I am resolved to wait the Lord of Heaven and Earths leisure, till
such time as he shall be graciously pleased to afford so much leisure to the
high and Honorable Court of Parliament to hear such witnesses as I shall
produce, to the end that the Depositions being printed in the same Book, every
Subject in the Kingdom, as well in great Cities and Towns Corporate, as in the
Country, may be satisfied concerning the truth thereof, and so be more apt to
yield unanimous consent, which is all that is wanting for the full
accomplishment of this laudable work. And if any man be extraordinarily
desirous to be further satisfied concerning this business for the present, he
may be allowed to peruse the written Copies before the printing, as many have
already done to their great contentment.

And I wish no man to think that this is a device to exhaust his purse; for the
truth is, I wrote the same for no other cause, but because I saw that all those
books, which were formerly written upon this Subject, were written by men which
had not attained to any considerable Perfection in the Knowledge of Nature; and
such as had but a glimmering light of such great Secrets, as Nature has
heretofore locked up in her Storehouse, and so were ignorant in the
fundamental points and causes of Vegetation and Multiplication. Whereupon I
concluded that the Teachers and the Teached were nothing else but the blind
leading of the blind, by which we all fell into the ditch; I mean we lived in
want and misery, when we might more easily have lived in plenty and
prosperity.

This is the first Pamphlet that I wrote since the beginning of this
Parliament, and I intend it shall be the last; let every one make use of it,
whom it concerns freely; which is every one that draws breath in this
Commonwealth, or shall draw breath in future ages in it: It is sufficient for
me that I have not buried my talent.

As for the particular way, whereby this wonderful improvement may be brought
to pass, here is no room in this penny book; therefore I will only show how
every one in the Kingdom, as well in great Cities, as in the Country towns may
be an helper in this happy work, and raise some considerable gain to himself,
and that great Cities which in former times devoured the fatness of the whole
Kingdom, may yield a considerable retribution yearly without any man's
prejudice, so that the fertility of the Country needs not be so much
diminished as in former times.

And therefore every one is desired to take this one thing into consideration,
that as any parcel of good land, being kept in pasture, and having the dung,
which it breeds, spent upon it, does continue fertile for ever, without any
other addition: so the excrements, and materials, which any family produces,
being well contrived, will produce yearly as much bread, and drink, as that
family spends for ever.

But the better to stir up all poor maidservants to put to their helping
hand, let them be pleased to understand, that I taught a poor woman to get 3.
pounds a year, which she has continued many years, without any considerable
labor, or neglecting her other occasions, and thus she practiced.

When she washed, and swept rooms at her neighbors houses, instead of casting
many materials to the common dunghill, she took them home with her at night,
and laid them in a corner, and once a year, she sold them for above 3. li.
Besides she laid aside every year as many linen rags as yielded her forty
shillings, and her labor in receiving her five pounds from the Bargeman, or
thereabout every year, was almost as much as all her other labor, I mean
extraordinary labor.

If young poor maidservants will imitate her industry, I will tell them the
whole Secret, to the intent that besides the benefit to the public, every one
may get her self a considerable portion; and to the end that many may be
industrious in this laudable way, and that many thousands may remember me, and
my posterity in their prayers, I will first speak a good word for them to all
generations to come, to wit, that such an one, which by her wit, industry, and
providence, gets her self a portion of twenty or forty pounds (which she
may easily do in a certain number of years, not very many) deserves as good a
marriage as one that has an hundred pounds given her by her parents, and
friends.

And to the end that this may not seem to be a ridiculous relation, I will show
the reasons of it, and also the experience, and lastly declare the several
materials which I taught her to reserve.

As for the reasons, they are thus discovered, viz. the vegetable spirit of the
world, by which all things do increase and multiply, is sometimes clothed with
a gross, and earthly foeculencie, as in dung, and more in some dung, then in
other: sometimes it is more purified from i^s earthly foeculencie, and then it
is far more effectual, as we see by experience in London, that a load of
shavings of horn is sold for 50 shillings, or 3. li. a load of woollen rags is
sold for 30. or 40. s. when as a load of common dung is sold for a penny, and
many times for nothing but carriage away; the book formerly mentioned, will
further satisfy any one that is inquisitive, so I will proceed to declare the
several materials which I taught her to reserve: as for the linen rags she
reserved those before I knew her, and sold them yearly to the Paper-Mils, and I
seeing her industry, thought it a good deed, to advise her to reserve all the
shreads, and rags of woollen cloth as well old as new, all the shreads, and
pieces of leather of all kinds as well old as new, all the horns, and hoofs of
beasts of all kinds, whether shaven, or not, that came in her way, all the
hair, either in Barbers shops, or Tanners yards, or at the houses of Butchers,
and Cooks, where they scalde many hogs, and pigs, and fondly cast away the
hair, and to take up all the old shoes, and pieces of leather which happened
in her way, as she went about her ordinary occasions, and to work as often as
she could, at the houses of Tailors, Shoomakers, Sadlers, etc.

For I have found by experience, that a load of the best common dung, will not
produce corn worth above twenty shillings at three crops, unless corn be very
dear, and if it be far carried, then the labor, rent, and seed, will consume
the gains, whereas a load of any of these materials formerly mentioned, will
produce wheat, and other corn, worth above 10. li. though the price be
reasonable.

These things being well considered, there is great reason why these materials
should not be fondly cast away to the common dunghill in great Cities, or other
places, whereas the greatest part thereof is utterly lost; and though some of
them go to the dunghill, yet they serve only to enrich land, which lies near
to great Cities, where there is no need of them, whereas being reserved by
themselves, they will quit the cost to be carried 20 or 30 miles, and so make
land fertile, which bears not half the quantity for want of dung.

And whereas I have found by experience, that a load of any manner of seeds,
whatsoever, does contain as much of the vegetable spirit of the world, as ten
loads of common dung, I could wish, that all such young menservants, as have
no Stocks nor Trades, should get them services, in great Innes, or to be
Bailiffs of Husbandry to great men, and to reserve all the hay seeds that come
within their reach, and all the soot that is swept down out of the chimneys,
that they can get, and once in a year to get so much blood at any Butchers, or
Poulterers houses, as will make them into a paste, and then to add so much
cow dung dried to them, as being tempered with urine, will be sufficient to
make the whole mass apt to be formed into the form of bricks, loaves, or
cheeses, and then they are to be laid up in a dry place, till they be thoroughly
rotten, and that a small quantity thereof being made into powder will not
produce any thing suddenly, being spread in a garden or other open place where
the rain may fall upon it, without the help of new seed, then though their
common dung will yield no price at all in that place, but rather they are
forced to pay money to have it carried away, yet this will give them a large
price, after that the virtue thereof is known.

And if any such menservants have means to farm certain Acres of barren land,
which lies so remote from dung, that the annual rent thereof is little, then
by setting of wheat, or other grain, by my directions in my book formerly
mentioned, they may make one quarter, or one pounds worth of corn, to yield 40.
quarters, or 40 pounds worth of corn in less time then one year, and as much
over, and above, as shall pay all charges, and workmen nobly, and also as much
rent as any ordinary Farmer can afford to give yearly for it, by which means
he may in a few years get a considerable Stock, and be as likely to thrive as
he that has twice so much given him by his parents, or friends; and I could
wish all such men to marry with such women as by their wit, industry, and
providence have gotten themselves portions by my directions in this little
book: and let the others which have portions given do the like, and try
conclusions whether of them thriveth better.

If any one should be seen to cast away good bread, when so many poor people
want it, then all the world would cry shame upon him; but why should not the
casting away of any of these materials fondly, be reputed a more heinous sin,
when as they will produce diverse times their weight of as good bread as any
Prince eats.

I have seen by experience, that Saltpeter is the most rich compost in the
world, to multiply corn, and I have seen fifty pounds worth of Saltpeter
extracted out of a vault at Dowgate, not very spacious, which was formerly an
house of office, and not emptied till the matter was thoroughly rotten, why may
not the same thing be done by Art, which was formerly done by Nature, and
accident? I have been credibly informed that such a work is ordinarily done, in
the Kingdom of China, and also at the City of Paris in France, and I see no
reason why English men should not have as much wit as they.

If any man has convenient room to build two houses of office, and to close
up the one whilst he uses the other, then there can be no question, but that
instead of the charge of emptying, and noysomnesse of the smell, he may have it
emptied for nothing, and feel the sweet smell of money very grateful to most
men, and that in as great quantity, or greater, then he receives for his
ordinary edifices: besides that he will show himself to be a good member of
the body politic, or Commonwealth, wherein he lives: but he must beware, that
the matter do lie dry, and that no adventitious moisture come to it, either
from beneath, or from above, which will be somewhat more chargeable in moist
grounds, then where the earth is very dry by its own nature.

And whereas it is clear as the Sun, that the flesh and blood of a beast is
five times as good as the dung of a beast, and that the skin, hair, wool,
horns, and hoofes, are ten times as good as the dung; and that these things are
at the least the third part of the fertility and wealth of the Kingdom, and
that these things are for the most part lost, and cast away for want of
general knowledge: I could wish that every Householder in the Kingdom would
make use of this book, and let it be common for all his family, to read, or
hear it read, to the end that some considerable quantity thereof might be
preserved, the price is but a penny, the soote in every ones chimney will pay
him again, for a bushel of soote will produce two bushels of wheat, if it be
well ordered, because it abounds much with the vegetable spirit of the world,
by which all sublunarie things do increase and multiply.

And whereas there is much food of all kinds spoiled for want of looking, as
mustie corn, mouldie cheese, stinking flesh, and fish, also if any man have
any horses, or beasts, that die by accident, let all men be pleased to receive
instructions in the said book formerly mentioned, how to recover some
considerable share of their losses; and if any one cannot find out some way or
other to benefit himself more or less, by the reading of the said book,
besides the good to the public, let him lay the blame no where else but upon
the weakness of his own understanding, for it will be proved against him, that
some have advanced their revenues above a thousand pounds per annum, by some
small part of the skill contained in the said book. And if every poor servant
cannot get themselves portions of considerable value, by reason that their
masters houses afford not store of such materials, nor spare room to lay them
in, then let them get five shillings a year, that they may do in the poorest
house in the Kingdom, yea the poorest beggars, that go from door to door,
may get more then that, so shall they get themselves every year a suit of
clothes, if they buy them at the second hand, and show their love to the
Commonwealth; and perhaps some good minded man, seeing their industry, may
disburse money for the accomplishing of one crop, and take it again with
interest, or without interest, out of the first part that is sold, so will the
remainder afford them a considerable portion. And though that waste paper of
all sorts, either white, or brown, or written, or printed, be not very good to
make barren land fertile, yet it will make good passe-board, the white is worth
three farthings a pound, and the other an half penny a pound to make brown
passe-board good to cover books, and all other things where the color is
hidden in the work, and therefore worthy to be reserved, for in some houses it
is of very considerable value.

And let all men be pleased to take into serious consideration, that as in
every centurie of years there do more people die, then are in the world at any
one time; so in every centurie of years, there is more Wealth lost fondly for
want of knowledge in England, in the complete Art of Agriculture, then is in
the Kingdom at any one time, yea though an Inventorie were taken, and valued
at Michaelmas, when the whole years fruits are engrossed together, which sum
will double throughout the whole Kingdom, (especially in the Country) to the
like Inventorie taken at May day, when the years fruits are almost wasted, and
little remaining but hopes, which are not usually put into Inventories.

Whereas it will plainly appear to all rational men, that I wish well to all
in general, let them be pleased to accept of one friendly advertisement more,
for a parting blow, Christ says, he that is not with me, is against me,
admitting of no neutralitie: and I say, that whosoever does not according to
his ability, and opportunity, further this blessed work, more or less,
lives in a destructive way to the Commonwealth, or body politic, whereof he
is a member, though an unworthy one, and justly deserves to be cut off after
admonition, which an ingenious publication of this book will perform in such
manner, that whosoever shall fondly cast away any materials, which will produce
bread, cannot expect any other sentence at the great day of account, but the
very same which all those are like to receive, which have taken childrens
bread, and cast it to the dogs.

Now for my conclusion, I will make bold to borrow it out of Geber his book, an
Arabian Prince, and a famous Philosopher, because my wit will not serve to
endite a better: he when he had found out the profound Art of transmutation of
metals, said, Facilius est autum construere, quam destruere: and I say, that it
is more easy for any Kingdom to live in happiness, plenty, and prosperity,
if all were willing, then to live in misery, indigence, and adversity; he
being over-joyed, and straying his wit for an admirable expression of his
thankfulness to the sacred Deity, for bestowing upon him that great
knowledge, said thus; Est donum Dei altissimi, qui cui vult, largitur and
subtrahit, benedictus ergo sit Deus sublimis, gloriosus, and omnipotens, and
benedictum sit ejus nomen, in secula seculorum: And all that have seen this
Copy before the printing, are confident that it will do more good in the
world, then ever the Philosophers Stone did yet since the world began,
whereupon I suppose I may lawfully make use of his conclusion.

Lord will deliver him in the time of trouble.
