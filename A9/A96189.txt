THE WELSH HUBUB, Or the Unkennelling and Earthing of HUGH PETER'S That Crafty
Fox.
HEr will speak truth, her scorns to tell you tales,
Was gallant things, called prophesies in Wales
Truer then Mandivill, which do assure us
Arthurus quandom Rex, and Rex futurus:
Law there; nay more, our Merlin farther goes
Descending to our times, and points at those,
Who shall disturb our peace, and raise strange wars
Amongst our selves, with horrid civil Jars,
Murder with rapine, and says that Sais Kee
Shall plundra Kefill glace, and Kefill Dee,
From honest Taffy; that the Mole or want
Shall undermine us, and our Rights supplant:
This Mole Expositors with one consent
Do call the long-taild ramping-Parliament:
That this is come to pass none can deny
Though Cutterell mawr, himself were standing by;
An other in his learned rimes does say,
The Lions whelp is forced to fly away,
And that the 7th of Ireland he shall be
Again restored unto his Royalty,
Hall, Ned, Mall, Bess, James, and two Charles, I wiss
Make just up seven; our Merlin does not miss
And that in express terms a Monk shall bring
And reinvest great Charles our sacred King:
And look you here now, is not this all true
Her will speak one word more and so adieu
When all this is full-fiild, then draws on
The time we call naw mish Capisteron;
And what is that Hugh? I Will tell the it is a time
When such as thou shall up a ladder clime,
Not unto Peter, Porter at heaven gate,
But there to fetch a swing or two, thy fate
Will have it so, and if it be thy chance
Amongst the traitors for to lead the dance,
Thou shall not turn alone, there will be more
To follow the upon the self same score,
To traverse ground, to change to turn and fling
and cut strong Capers in a hempen string;
I need not name them, Hugh, thou know u'm well,
They Will make a lusty Cushing dance to hell:
But yet me thinks, it is not very fit
That men alone without some femal chit
Should make a Ball, send for thy deer Nan Hedge,
For whom in former time thou wast a pledge;
Though M^rss the Jailer brought her back again
To wood-street Counter, and there lod'g the
If one will not suffice, then send for more
The world well knows Hugh Peter's loves a --
And though, his calling of the soul takes care,
Yet honest Hugh will give the flesh a share,
And teach his Auditors, how they may see,
And find out Puss sitting in Majesty:
The surpless he abhors yet loves the smock,
And when he fails of that heel use the frock,
And so disgui'ed he thought the world to mock
When Martyred Charles his head lay on the block:
If by these signs you cannot find him out
Instead of Hu-bub I have sent a scout,
Who now returned, this narrative declares,
The subtle Fox some times is caught with snares,
On friday it was, which some call venus day
Because that Planet then does bear the sway
And is predominant, and has a slight
A pretty one whither't be day or night
To couple loving things: the sent grows hot,
And though our Hugo cunningly had got
Him self into a Quakers house called Broad
The fitest host to harbor such a --:
Murder will not lie hide, his haunt is found,
And steps are tract, without the help of hound;
Hugh hunts not counter yet the wily whelp
Finds out a cunning shift himself to help;
To bed he goes, where Mrs Peach lay in
The woman being green I hope no sin
Was there committed, (weighty things in hand
Men upon coulo^rs do not often stand)
The proverb says, here lurking he lay still
As safe as any these lies in a Mill
Often in the pulpet he was wont to say
He envied much those little doges which lay
In Ladies beds places far more fit
For men of lusty courage and choice wit,
He has his wish; the officers forbear
In modesty the child bed to draw near,
And fall to search all the Rooms and places,
As it is the common use in such like cases,
The next house was John Days an upright Quaker
Because a Cobbler, and a great pertaker
With Hugh's desines: whilst each one beats his brains
To find the fugitives, and spairs no pains
Scowring each corner with a Zealous eye
Werei't but as big where in a mouse might lie:
Hugh takes his time, and whilst their all at gaze,
Makes an escape and hyes unto the Maze;
His rapiere with his bible, and his coat
He leaves behind, by which the searchers note
Hugh cannot be far of, to Horse way down
Where one Nathaniell Mun, a man well known --
Had his abode, a tape-maker by trade,
Though it were fitter far he halters made,
Peter's conveyes himself; with open Cry
The chase is followed, Law-now by and by
They find the horse, Mun's wife she keeps the door
They thrust, she holds; I cannot tell you more,
But some do say she had adown-right fall,
Yet I Will not say she played at up tails all,
Up stairs with full careirs the serjant goes
But at the door he finds one to oppose,
And stoutly too, by which he aims and right
It Was Hugh himself, with all his main and might,
That strenth is reenforc't with new supplies
For, Mr Arnold, Hobkins, Harris flies
Unto the battry, who with doubled force
Compel proud Peter to retreat: Remorce
Now seazeth on him, and he faints for fear
All symptoms of a Quaker now appear,
With Impudence and brazen face he cries
I am not Peter's, who so calls me lies
My name is Thomson; if that it be so
Then Duplex nomen Duplex Nebulo:
My action's good in the law against you all
Who thus abuse and wrongfully miscall
An honest man, t'oth damage of his purss
And infamy of him; which is far worss.
With this arrives young Peach (whose wife lay in
Within which bed Hugh-Peters with out sin
Had hid himself) and being asked if he
Such Gloves, or Cane, as those did ever see,
I did quoth he, and testify I can,
They do belong unto that Gentelman,
Pointing to Hugo: Hugo in a fume
Denies it stoutly; but yet does assume
The pair of gloves, which on his hands he draws,
Those bloody hands worser then Tigers paws,
I Will not deny but these are mine quoth he
Liars ought to have a present memory,
Which Hugo faild of: Hugo must away,
The case is clear, he may not longer stay,
Then take him, Derick, Gentelmen I pray
Call me not Peter's, least upon the way
The incenst many hearing of my name
Like Doctor Lamb should stone me for the same
This granted Hugo, once again does crave
That he some private conference, may have
With Mirs. Mun, women are best pleased when
They meet in private with strong dockt able men;
But that denied, the stallion being dry
After the sports and heats of venery,
He calls for drink his spirits to revive,
It seems their thirsty who do often --
Two quarts of rot-gut beer he swalowes up
Desiring neither goblet horn or cup,
Though I suppose horns he might have had
Having himself, made many run horn mad.
Now to the Tower must poor Peter's trudge,
Patience good Hugo it is in vain to grudge
Before the grave Lieutenent he is brought
What change is this? would ever man have thought,
Cromwells Confessor should be forced t'appeare,
Before a Royalist or Chavilier
As a Delinquent; yet it is true, it is done
He Is under loyal Sir John Robinson
Where we will leave him to repent, if he
Be not too over grown in vilanie,
Once her remembers he did make a preach,
And in her sermon did false doctrine teach
Saying, the Welsh were only good to be
Made hanging Clappers for a wooden tree:
But yet her cozen lives, and may in time
Behold Hugh Peter's mounting up, and clime
The tritle tree, which stands by Hide park pale,
For if her judgment do not highly fail
He has deserved it: thus the Fox you see
Is eartht; if you do ask how this can be,
Go to the Tower and you shall find it true
Or else believe me not, and when old Hugh
From this frail world shall take his last farwell,
I Will be his friend and ring his passing bell,
With out a clapper not with out a roape
For that will be his end as most do hope
