The Second Address FROM THE GENTLEMEN OF THE COUNTY of NORTHAMPTON, To his
EXCELLENCY The Lord General MONCK.
May it please your EXCELLENCY,
HAVING lately under the sense of our Oppressions, presented our Desires unto
You at NORTHAMPTON, for a Full and Free PARLIAMENT, We now account our selves
obliged to return your Excellency our humble and hearty thanks, for that
(through the blessing of God, upon Your Prudent Conduct) the Secluded MEMBERS
are restored to the Freedom of their Places, and Votings, and thereby our
Hopes far advanced, that if our Sins hinder not, we may in due time obtain our
full Desires, and see these Nations once more settled in Righteousness and
Peace. And we beseech your Excellency not to slack your endeavors for the
perfecting this good work so happily begun, whereby you may get to your self
and your Posterity an Immortal Name, and engage us further to be

Your EXCELLENCIES most Humble SERVANTS.
