The Sense of the Oxford-Iunto, Concerning the late Treaty; wherein the
several Reasons are delivered, why they could not conclude a Peace with the
Parliament: And Published for the Satisfaction of the whole Kingdom.
GIve ear (beloved Countrymen)
Who long so much for Peace,
And guess a Treaty the only means
The Kingdom to release:
Be not mistaken thus to think;
For we were sent so far
As Vxbridge, but to swear and drink,
And not to end the War.
Through our dissembling Impudence
Your hearts (we know) were full
Of Joy, and did us true believe,
Whereas we meant to Gull:
What though the Kingdom bleeding lie,
Yet Peace is out of season,
And that Bug-beare we do defy
For many a weighty reason.
First, I Will no Peace, says Rupert;
Good Uncle, do not think,
That I can leave your Kingdom so
While there is any chincke:
You know for Plunder I did come
With German tag and rag;
And I Will have more ere I go home.
Again unto the Hague.
Do (Brother) do, says Maurice,
I like the Humor dear,
And could contented be to have
The War last many a year:
Let Us keep us still on English ground,
And for our selves create
Possessions of as large a bound,
As the Palatinate.
Then from his Pen starts Digby,
And cries 't was Princely spoken,
Since hope there was that France would send
Ten thousand for a token
Besides, the Gallant Irish vow
To pawn their Praying Beads,
Rather than we should yield them now
A Peace, to lose our Heads.
It Is true (my Son) quoth Bristoll,
Then write a Declaration
Of our late Treating, which we will send
To cheat each foreign Nation:
For we must make the world believe,
None more for Peace requested
Than we, or else they will laugh in sleeve,
And we shall be detested.
But Brother mine, says Cottington,
I am Lord Treasurer;
Yet not one Penny can produce
For to maintain the War:
And now the tottering State of Spain
Can spare us no relief,
I live to bear the Bag in vain,
And may die like a Thief.
Fie, fie my Lord, then Winchester
Bids him not to despair,
And cheeres him with large Rodomonts,
Much like a Wise man's Heir:
I Will do my best to keep off Peace,
And stoutly put all Care by;
For if from Basing they me chase,
I Will run to my Lord of Darby.
Darby, He will do any thing,
So they the War prolong,
If that his Countess give him leave;
For she at home's most strong:
But if that Latham yielded be,
And they escape well can,
Her, and these two Wits, you may see
Reign in the I Will of Man.
And I, Lord Paulet, would be glad
To have the War still spun out,
Because I know from Basing-house
The Fool at length will run out:
Then there to have Command in chief
I Am sure will be my fate;
And like a good brotherly Thief,
Beg him and his Estate.
It Is a good Christian act (my Lord)
I Hopton do allow it;
For I was once esteemed a Saint,
As all the World does know it:
And for this Name more War I Will wage,
Till I it gain from Rome;
So Traitors shall a Pilgrimage
Make yearly to my Tomb.
And I, Duke Lennox, will contend,
As long as I do live,
With Papists how to raise and stretch
The Kings Prerogative:
Then I may rage and domineere
Over my Countrymen,
Or else I shall be shamed t'appear
In Scotland ere again.
A fig (my Lord) says Capel,
The Scots we soon will beat;
However, let us go and seem
As if we meant to Treat:
They cut my Woods, both Branch and Boughs,
My Timber all is fallen,
As if they were to roste the Cowes
Which ever I have stolen.
And I (quoth Kingston) am undone,
Except we fight it out;
Because for Bishops I did plead,
The Vulgar will me flout:
Besides, my Father money lent
Unto the King great store;
Unless we slave the Parliament,
I never shall see it more.
Who would not fight, cries Dunsmore,
An Earl to be enstil'd?
To lose a Lordship, Hatton says,
Would make a Courtter wild:
Culpepper, he grows hot in the mouth,
Damnes Peace, as if he meant,
Rather than not to be a Lord,
Fight to be King of Kent.
Sir Nicholas, he to treat will go,
But swe^res he shall miscarry;
The very thought of Peace will spoil
Him for a Secretary.
He with them thus conditions then,
That if they stay the longer,
For him to choose some other man
Of constitution stronger.
Then up a Bench of Lawyers stand,
And in their Judgment gave,
'Twas fit Sir Edward Nicholas might
His Habeas Corpus have:
Ned Hide, and Laene, they were the chief,
I need to name no more,
Who for their Knighthoods stood so stiff,
And shut Peace out of door.
But all to fight for the known Laws,
As Littleton maintains;
Who strove to steal away the Seal,
Yet got nothing for his pains:
For when the man to Oxford came.
They fell to swear and curse,
And asked him if he did not shame
To bring an empty Purse.
But he at length in favor crept
Among the Medley Rout,
And is against the name of Peace
As zealous and as stout:
An't please your Majesty, says he,
If wisely you will deal,
The Ordnance still must mounted be,
They will make good the Seal.
And I (my Liege) says Heath, affirm
None better can than these,
Restore again the Chancerie,
Your Bench, or Common Pleas:
Fight on, by Law I Will make it good,
Pull down the Senate's pride;
It is not fit a Treaty should
This difference decide.
Then spoke Armagh, if Law it be,
I Will prove it Gospel too,
By such a knotty Syllogism
As no man shall undo:
In Bishops breasts all truth does rest,
Scorn Treating then, and come;
We Will give each man a hallowed crest,
And Consecrated drum.
And I (quoth Duppa) do protest,
That they which but begin
To think of pulling Bishops down
Commit a heinous sin:
What a cursed thing then Treating is,
How odious is Peace,
Which envies Churchmen worldly bliss,
Great honors, pride, and ease!
And Stewart vows he will be content
Much rather soon to die,
Than let his Conscience witness bear
Unto Presbytery:
What though it does appear more right,
I never will confess?
Let Us Treat in show, break off, and fight,
Upon advantages.
But hark ye (Sirs) says Dorset,
Do any thing you please;
Yet for one reason I desire,
That we might have a Peace:
I cannot act a Soldiers part,
Nor freezing lie in Trenches;
But wish my self with all my heart
At Chelsey with my Wenches.
Zounds, a Sedan, cries Goring,
To cage this piece of sloth;
Dammee, but one word more of Peace,
I Will stabbe him with an Oath:
My Father was in days of yore
A Monopolizing vermin,
But now is glad to keep the door,
And cringe to Harry Iermin.
That was a gallant trade at Court.
Then said Endymion Porter,
When Subjects pockets we could fish,
And clip their purse strings shorter:
But now the block runs in my mind
When I dream of Peace in bed;
Then 'wake, and feel, yet nothing find
About me but my head.
O monstrous! then cries Windebanke,
That dreams should prove so true;
I fear then I shall be undone
By Peace as well as you:
What though I am a Jesuit,
(God bless our good Queen Mary)
Yet if the Roundheads we out-fight,
I shall still be Secretary.
And I, Tom. Lunsford, hope to be
Lieutenant of the Tower,
Then I shall have the Citizens
Again within my power:
And like tame Slaves, I will them teach
An iron chain to wear;
The Ordnance also shall soon reach
As far as Westminster.
But soft there (Tom) quoth Byron,
Thou art yet but a Knight;
For murders cool, I Lorded was,
After the end of the fight:
Then I may be Lieutenant made
Rather than thee, I hope,
Since I more cruel am, if not
Prevented by a Rope.
I fear not Ropes, says Langdale,
Hanging to mee's a jest;
I Will venture neck at any time
To the weight of my thin chest:
If Peace come, I will yield thus far,
And give them many thanks;
Yet one thing by the way I bar,
All pulling by the Shankes.
O Lord, how dare you venture so,
Sir Skellum Grenvile cries!
The very thought of it does make
Blood in my face to rise:
Peace is a sweet soft name to some,
But to me it sounds like Thunder,
More terrible than a Plymouth Drum,
And will rob me of my Plunder.
A Skiffe, a Skiffe, baules Dives,
If ye talk more of Peace;
Hells torments light on every wretch
That prays the War might cease:
For then my Brother George, and I,
After the Queen must dance,
And live on Popish Charity,
In Italy, Spain, or France.
You see (beloved Countrymen)
How Peace is out of season;
For which you have the Junto's Sense,
And each Commanders reason:
Then pray you do not take it ill
W^ you deceived by Treating;
^t you may have Peace, if you will
But give us a sound Beating.
FINIS.
