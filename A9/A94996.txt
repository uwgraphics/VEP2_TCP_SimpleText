A TRVE COPY OF A LETTER from CHESTER, concerning diverse Passages of the LORD
STRANGE there, sent to a worthy Gentleman, and read in the HOUSE of COMMONS.
SIr I have yours of thirteen instant, and thank you for the good news
therein, most of the Letters that came this week were opened, yours to me not
opened, nor none of mine but one Letter before the Post came, it was here
reported that Marquess Hartford had given a great overthrow to my Lord of
Bedford, God be thanked that so many of the Cavaliers are brought to London,
there is such a cursed crew of them given over to all manner of lewd courses,
inventing new damnable oaths, we have some here Irish, that pretend they stay
for my Lord Lieutenant.

The King this day is expected at Shrosburie, and its thought will be here
upon Monday or Tuesday next, many idle rogues billetted nere the City, being
those soldiers that my Lord Strange has raised, they carry arms out of this
Town in the night by carts for my Lord Strange his service, being the arms
sent by the Parliament for the service of Ireland, some having been landed out
of the ships that were bound for Ireland, and by my Lord Strange his warrant,
who has done more then he can justify, he has soldiers billeted in several
places near the City, and keeps them to attend him, while the King comes into
these parts: so not troubling you further, I rest.

Ordered that this Letter be forthwith Printed and Published. H. Elsinge, Cler.
Parl. D. Com.
