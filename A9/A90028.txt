A New SONG, In Praise of the Loyal Company of STATIONERS, Who (after the
general forfeit,) for Their singular Loyalty, obtained the first CHARTER of
LONDON, Anno 1684.
To the Tune of, Winchester Wedding.
^

1.
IN London was such a Quarter,
The like was never known,
About the forfeited CHARTER
Betwixt the Court and the Town;
The Masters went crouding before,
The Prentices in the Rear did fall,
There were ten thousand and more,
Attended to lead up the Brawl:
Kit Armed with a Fork and a Spade,
And Bob with a Shovel and Fork,
But Tender was for a surrender,
And now it began to work.
2.
Quoth Willy what lose the CHARTER?
I Will sooner lose my Head;
Quoth Robin I Will die a Martyr
Before that shall ever be said:
Quoth John you may shut up your Shopping,
Your CHARTER was all your Shield,
For every Seaman of Wapping,
May be Freeman now of the Guield;
Quoth a Butcher; the Beggarly French
Will out of our Mouths cat the Bread;
But the Weaver, he cocked up his Beaver,
And valiantly marched at the Head.
3
But Stationers Hall so Loyal,
The CHARTER by which they meet,
The gift of his Ancesters Royal,
Did humbly lay at His Feet:
Whose Suit he so far befriendeth,
Their Liberties know no bound,
Their CHARTER her wings extends
through London, and many miles round.
And now from the Bigot and Whig,
(To distinguish the good men, and true)
The Table is purged, and the Rabble
With the Members excluded withdrew.
4
With limping Dick, the Zealou^,
Went doting yea, and nay,
And squinting Jack so Jealous.
Lest Loyalty got the day.
With these Jack Thumb was reckoned;
And hungry Will of the wood;
And I rank the first, and the second,
And George that will never be good,
And thus they did trip it along,
Whilst William led up the Brawl,
But Jonny did storm above any,
To be turned out of the Hall.
5.
Jack gave his right hand to Harry,
Who now his place had lost,
And swore if the day they carry,
The Loyal should pay for the Roast.
But Robin who made a trial,
And found how the Jig would go,
Resolved to change sides, and be Loyal,
But all the Dissenters said no;
Thus whilst to the CHARTER or Law,
They would no obedience yield,
The glory was still True Tory,
Is Master of the Field.
6.
Now to the Stationers Honor,
The CHARTER is on Record;
Great CHARLES the Bountiful Donor,
Their Franchises has restored;
To whose everlasting Glory,
Thy Honor will still redound;
That they are the first in story,
Who London's CHARTER did found;
Then to the brave Founder a Health,
Who first did our Freedom create,
A Bumper to CHARLES; to the Rumper
A Halter, and Armstrong's Fate.
Printed by N. T. at the entrance into the Old-Spring-Garden, 1684.
