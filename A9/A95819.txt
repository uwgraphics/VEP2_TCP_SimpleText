Samuel Vassal of London, Esquire;
HUmbly desires your Honors to commiserate his sad condition, who for want of
his just debt due to him from this Commonwealth, formerly placed upon the
Excise, is like to perish. This Honorable House on the 15 of May last,
recommended as their desires to his Highness the Lord Protector, that care
might be taken for the speedy payment of the said debt, being 2591 l. 17 s. 6
d. principal, with the use thereof, which does amount unto 4251 l. as by
Auditors account given to his Highness Honorable Council appears, and his
Highness recommended the same to his Honorable Council, that care be taken
that the Parliaments desires might be satisfied, and on the 26 of May, their
Honors did order one thousand pounds to be paid out of the Excise Office,
which he received: But ever since that time, he has waited at the door of the
Honorable Council, but had no other answer but they knew not where to place
it: So for want of the said money his credit is much impaired, which is more
dear then life to him, and his posterity like to be destroyed, if he find not
some speedy relief from this Honorable House; for his Creditors prosecute him
now with more violence, seeing their hopes frustrate, in not receiving that
money which they hoped for: Wherefore he humbly desires your Honors favorable
assistance that Mr. Fowel may be heard, who is to report to the Honorable
House the conclusion of the Honorable Committee appointed for his business,
and that he may receive some speedy rerelief, that he may not lose his liberty
with his credit, and see his posterity ruined before his face, which will be as
a double death, and so bring his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave; but he is
confident of the Honor and Justice of this Honorable House, that they will
never suffer him and his posterity to perish, who has done and suffered so
much for their sakes.
