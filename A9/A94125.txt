A SVPPLY OF PRAYER For the Ships of this KINGDOM That want MINISTERS to Pray
with them: AGREEABLE TO THE DIRECTORY Established by PARLIAMENT.

Published by Authority.

May 16: LONDON: Printed for John Field, and are to be sold at his house upon
Addle-hill. 1645

A Reason of this Work.
WHereas there are thousands of ships belonging to this Kingdom, which have not
Ministers with them to guide them in Prayer, and therefore either use the old
Form of Common Prayer, or no Prayer at all; The former whereof for many weighty
Reasons has been abolished, and the latter is likely to make them rather
Heathens then Christians (the Lords day being left without any mark of Piety or
Devotion) Therefore, to avoid these Inconveniences, It has been thought fit to
frame some Prayers, agreeing with the Directory established by Parliament; It
being hoped, that it will be no grief of heart to wise and full Christians, if
the thirsty drink out of Cisterns, when themselves drink out of Fountains; But
they will rather pity the wants of their needy Brethren, and out of Compassion
immitate him who fills the hungry with good things.

These Prayers being enlivened and sent up by the Spirit in him that prays,
may be lively Prayers and acceptable to him who is a Spirit, and accepts of
service in Spirit and Truth. And, in truth, though Prayers come never so new,
even from the Spirit, in one that is a guide in Prayer, if the Spirit do not
quicken and enliven that Prayer in the Hearer that follows him, it is to him
but a dead Form, and a very carcass of Prayer.

The Company being assembled, they may thus begin with Prayer: O Lord, in all
reverence and humility, we acknowledge thy incomprehensible Greatness and
Majesty, in whose presence we do now in a special manner appear, and our own
vileness and unworthiness, to approach so near thee; with our utter inability
of out selves, to such a holy duty. And we humbly beseech thee for pardon,
assistance, and acceptance, in the whole service now to be performed, and for a
Blessing on the particular portions of thy Word now to be read, and all in the
Name and Mediation of the Lord Jesus Christ; In whose name and words we pray
unto thee farther, saying, Our Father, etc.

After this, some Psalms and Chapters being read out of both Testaments (but
none out of those Books which are commonly called Apocrypha) and a Psalm being
sung, a Prayer may follow in this manner: O Great and gracious Lord, we
acknowledge before thee our sinfulness, first, by reason of Original sin,
which (besides the guilt of it, which makes us liable to eternal damnation) is
the seed of all other sins, and has depraved and poisoned all the faculties
and powers of soul and body, and does defile our best actions, and (were it not
restrained, or our hearts renewed by Grace) would break forth into innumerable
Transgressions, and the greatest Rebellions against the Lord, that ever were
committed by the vilest of the sons of men. And next, we acknowledge the guilt
of Actual sins, our own sins, the sins of Magistrates, of Ministers, and of
the whole Nation, unto which we are many ways accessory; Which sins of ours
receive many fearful aggravations, we having broken all the Commandments of
the holy, just, and good Law of God, doing that which is forbidden, and leaving
undone what is enjoined; and that not only out of ignorance and infirmity, but
also more presumptuously, against the light of our minds, checks of our
consciences, and motions of thy holy Spirit to the contrary, so that we have no
cloak for our sins; yea we have not only despised the riches of Gods
goodness, forbearance, and long-suffering, which should lead us to
Repentance, and Holiness; but have stood out against many invitations, and
offers of Grace in the Gospel, not endeavoring as we ought, to receive Christ
into our hearts by Faith, or to walk worthy of him in our lives. We bewail our
blindness of mind, hardness of heart, unbelief, impenitency, security, luke
warmness, barrenness, our not endeavoring after Mortification, and newness
of life; nor after the exercise of Godliness in the power thereof; and that
the best of us have not so steadfastly walked with God, kept our Garments so
unspotted, nor been so zealous of thy glory, and the good of others as we
ought, notwithstanding the manifold and great mercies of thee our God, the love
of Christ, the light of the Gospel, and Reformation of Religion, our own
Purposes, Promises, Vows, Solemn Covenants, and other special obligations to
the contrary. We acknowledge and confess, that as we are convinced of our
guilt, so out of a deep sense thereof, we judge our selves unworthy of the
smallest benefits, most worthy of thy fiercest wrath, and of all the curses of
the Law, and heaviest judgments inflicted upon the most Rebellious sinners;
and that thou might most justly take thy Kingdom and Gospel from us, plague
us with all sorts of Spiritual and Temporal judgments in this life, and
after cast us into utter darkness, in the Lake that burns with Fire and
Brimstone, where is weeping and gnashing of Teeth for evermore. Notwithstanding
all which, we draw near to the Throne of Grace, encouraging our selves, with
hope of a gracious answer of our Prayers, in the Riches and All Sufficiency of
that only one Oblation, the satisfaction and Intercession of the Lord Jesus
Christ, at the right hand of his Father, and our Father; and in confidence of
the exceeding great and precious promises of Mercy and Grace in the new
Covenant, through the same Mediator thereof. And we pray thee, for his sake, to
turn away thy heavy wrath and curse from us, which we are not able to avoid or
bear; and humbly and earnestly beseech thee, out of thy free Grace and Mercy,
to grant unto us the full Remission of all our sins, and that only for the
bitter sufferings, and precious merits of that our only Savior Jesus Christ.
O that the Lord would vouchsafe to shed abroad his love in our hearts by the
holy Ghost, to seal unto us by the same Spirit of Adoption, the full assurance
of our Pardon and Reconciliation, That he would comfort all that mourn in Zion,
speak peace to the wounded and troubled spirits, and bind up the broken
hearted; And as for secure and presumptuous sinners, Lord open their eyes,
convince their consciences, and turn them from darkness unto light, and from
the power of Satan unto God, that they also may receive forgiveness of sin,
and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by Faith in Christ Jesus.
With remission of sins through the blood of Christ, we pray thee also to give
us Sanctification by his Spirit; Mor^ification of sin dwelling in us, and many
times tyrannizing over us; the quickening of our dead Spirits with the life of
God in Christ; Grace to fit and enable us for all duties of conversation and
callings toward God and Man; strength against temptations, the sanctified use
of Blessings and Crosses, and perseverance in Faith and Obedience to our lives
end, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

A Prayer for the Church Universal, and our United Churches and Kingdoms.
O Lord, who do gather to thy self a Church out of all Nations, we beseech
thee, to this end to Propagate thy Gospel and the Kingdom of Christ Jesus to
all Nations, convert the Jews, fill up the fullness of the Gentiles, hasten the
fall of Antichrist, and the second coming of our Lord; Grant deliverance to the
distressed Churches abroad from the Tyranny of the Antichristian Faction, and
from the cruel oppressions and blasphemies of the Turk: We pray thee send thy
Blessing upon all the Reformed Churches, especially upon the Churches and
Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, now more strictly, and Religiously
united in the Solemn League and Covenant: We pray thee for our Plantations in
the remote parts of the world, more particularly for that Church and Kingdom
whereof we are Members, that therein God would establish Peace and Truth, the
Purity of all his Ordinances, and the power of godliness; prevent and remove
Heresy, Schism, Profaneness, Superstition, security, and unfruitfulnesse
under the means of Grace; heal our rents and divisions, and preserve us from
breach of our Solemn Covenant. We pray thee for all in Authority, especially
for the Kings Majesty, that God would make him rich in Blessings, both in his
Person and Government; Establish his Throne in Religion and Righteousness,
save him from evil Counsel, and make him a blessed and glorious Instrument for
the conservation and propagation of the Gospel, for the encouragement and
protection of them that do well, the terror of all that do evil, and the great
good of the Church of Christ, and of these United Kingdoms. We pray thee
convert the Queen, give a Religious Education to the Prince, and the rest of
the Royal Seed; comfort the afflicted Queen of Bohemia, Sister to our
Sovereign: We pray thee for the Restitution and Establishment of the
illustrious Prince, The Elector Palatine of the Rhene, to all his Dominions and
Dignities: Bless the High Court of Parliament, the Nobility, the subordinate
Judges and Magistrates, the Gentry, and all the Commonalty: Bless all Pastors
and Teachers, O Lord, fill them with thy spirit, and make them exemplarily
holy, sober, just, peaceable, and gracious in their lives; sound, faithful,
and powerful in their Ministry, and follow all their labors with abundance of
success and blessing; And give unto all thy People, Pastors according to thy
own heart: Bless the Universities, and all Schools, and Religious Seminaries
of Church and Commonwealth, that they may flourish more and more in Learning
and Piety. Power out a blessing upon the Ministry of the Word, Sacraments, and
Discipline; give thy mercy and consolation, to the afflicted under any inward
or outward distress; Lord, give unto us seasonable Weather, and Fruitful
Seasons: Lord, turn away thy Judgments, that we feel or fear, or are liable
unto, whether Famine, Pestilence, Sword, or any other. With all outward means
of salvation, be graciously pleased to power out the spirit of Grace into our
hearts, causing us to attain such a measure of the Excellency of the knowledge
of Christ Jesus our Lord, and in him of the things which belong to our Peace,
that we may account all things but as dung in comparison of him; and that we
tasting the first fruits of the glory that is to be revealed, may long for a
more full and perfect Communion with him, that where he is we may be also, and
enjoy the fullness of those joys and pleasures which are at thy Right hand for
evermore; and all this through the same Christ Jesus, our only Mediator and
Advocate, Amen.

After this Prayer, a Psalm may be sung, and the conclusion may be with a
Thanksgiving and Blessing. The Thanksgiving.
WE give thee thanks, most gracious Father, the Fountain of every good and
perfect gift, for all thy blessings, both Spiritual and Temporal; especially,
for thy great love, in sending thy Son Christ Jesus unto us; for the
Communication of thy holy spirit, for the light and liberty of thy glorious
Gospel, and the rich heavenly blessings revealed therein, as namely, our
Election, Vocation, Adoption, Justification, Sanctification, and hope of glory;
for the admirable goodness of God in freeing the land from Antichristian
darkness and Tyranny, and for all other National deliverances: We bless thee
for the Reformation of our Religion, our continual preservation, and for many
other Temporal blessings. We pray thee for the continuance of all thy favors
and blessings, and particularly of thy Gospel, and all the Ordinances thereof,
in their purity, power, and liberty: We pray thee make thy word powerful, that
it may abide in our hearts, and bring forth fruit in our live, and
conversations. We beseech thee fit and prepare us for death, and judgment, and
that we may watch for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: We entreat thee
forgive the i^iquity of our holy things, and accept of our Spiritual
sacrifices, through the merit and mediation of our great High Priest and
Savior, the Lord Christ Jesus, Amen.

Prayer for a Blessing.
THE Lord bless us, and keep us; the Lord make his face to shine upon us, and
be gracious unto us; the Lord lift up his countenance upon us, and give us his
Peace; And the very God of Peace, sanctify us wholly, that our whole spirit,
soul, and body, may be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ: And the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father,
and the Communion of the Holy Ghost be with us all, Amen.

A Prayer particularly fitted for those that travel upon the Seas.
O Lord, who art the hope of the ends of the Earth, and of those that are upon
the wide Sea, by whose Providence men go down to the Sea in Ships, and follow
business in great Waters, we pray thee to take both Ship and persons under thy
protection and preservation; and let a blessing come from thee upon our
businesses and endeavors. And, Lord, though we by our sins have deserved
rather curses then blessings, yet we pray thee to deal with us, not according
to our sins and our own deservings, but according to thy infinite free mercy,
and the merits of thy son Christ Jesus, which are of an infinite value. Behold
us in him, we beseech thee, in whom thou art well pleased, and in him be well
pleased with us. And, Lord, we pray thee that he may be unto us not only
justification from the guile of sin, but sanctification to deliver us from the
power and service of sin; that we may be partakers of his Holiness, without
which no man shall see thee. And, Lord, while we are upon the Seas, cause us to
take notice of thy great works, for thou have made the Sea, and therein
creatures innumerable, both small and great; And while we behold things
created by thee, let our hearts be lifted up to thee who have created them; to
worship thee, to love thee, and to serve thee; by whom, and for whom all things
were created. Keep us, Lord, from storms and tempests, and if they shall arise,
let thy word come forth, and turn the storm into a calm, make the Waters still,
and bring us in good season, to the Haven of our desires. In the mean time,
preserve us also from Sea-thieves, Enemies, and other dangers to which our
Voyages are subject; And, Lord, when thou shall preserve us, and bring us home
in safety, give us grace to be truly and really thankful to thee, and to
express our Thankfulness in a holy life and conversation; that we may serve,
and please thee, who preservest us. And let not thy often preservations of us,
make us the less sensible of them, but rather the more thankful to thee for
them; For, Lord we confess, such is the corruption of our nature, that when we
often pass through dangers, and escape them, we take less notice of thy
gracious providence and preservation in them; whereas we should be the more
thankful to thee, the more thou multipliest thy favors upon us. But, Lord,
yet very far be it from us, upon our returns to return to folly and sin, and
that we, whom thou preservest, should offend thee by sinful courses, in stead
of serving thee, and being thankful to thee; For, then may thou justly come
upon us by thy judgments, in an hour which we think not on, and let in the
Seas and other dangers upon us, to swallow us up and devour us, and after give
us our portion in a Lake of Fire that burns for evermore; But, Lord, we pray
thee to guide us ever by thy grace, and not to leave us to our selves and our
own corruptions, but through all the passages of this our pilgrimage, both upon
Sea and Land, lead us by thy good Spirit, and bring us at last to the true
Haven of Blessedness and place of rest, which is above in thy presence, where
is fullness of joy, and where are pleasures for evermore. Hear us, O Lord, and
accept our persons and prayers, through thy beloved son Christ Jesus, who,
sitting at thy right hand, makes intercession for us; to whom with the Almighty
Father, and the most blessed and holy Spirit, be all honor, service and
praise, from this time forth for evermore, Amen.

A Prayer in a Storm.
O Lord, we acknowledge, that by thy own Providence and will, this storm is now
come upon us; for thy Word has taught us, that thou command and raisest the
stormy Winds which lift up the waves of the Sea, so that they mount up to the
Heaven, and go down again to the Depths and the souls of men are melted because
of trouble, and they are at their wits ends. And, Lord, we confess that we
have sins enough to draw down all thy storms upon us, and to overwhelm us with
all thy waves: But, Lord, we beseech thee to make our hearts to search
themselves, as for all sins, so for those especially which may draw down this
great Tempest upon us; and let us cast out these sins as the Marrine^^ cast out
Jonah, and let the wind and Sea cease from their raging. And, Lord, we pray
thee that we may so cast them out, that we may never take them in again, lest
greater storms overtake us; For we acknowledge, that where sin is, there must
storms be expected; Storms and Tempests, Fire and Brimstone are the portion of
sinners; grant us also such grace, that we may not only hate our sins and cast
them out, because they are followed with storms and Judgments; but because
they are odious in themselves, being contrary to thy Righteous Law, and to thee
who art the Fountain and Rule of Righteousness. And, Lord, let us also take
thy Son Christ Jesus into our souls to sanctify them, and Reign in them,
remembering also that Christ Jesus makes a Calm in the souls where he Raigns,
for being justified by him, we have Peace with God; and he also when he was
here below, being in the Ship, made a calm there also, and commanded the winds
to be still: Lord, we pray thee, grant at this time both these calms unto us;
for as thy Word told us, that when thou command, a storm arises, so it also
shows us, that when men cry to thee in their trouble, thou bring them out
of their distress, thou make the storm a calm, and the waves of the Sea are
still then are men glad because they be quiet, and thou bring them to their
desired Haven. Lord, we beseech thee, let it be now to thy servants according
to this thy Word, and then let that also be done which justly follows: Let us
Praise the Lord for his goodness, and his wonderful works to the sons of
men; Let us Exalt thee in the Congregation of the People, and Praise thee in
the Assembly of the Elders: And if the Heathen Mariners which carried Jonah,
being delivered from the storm, did fear the Lord exceedingly, and offered
Sacrifice to the Lord, and made Vows; Let us much more who have the light of
the Gospel in so great a measure beyond them, fear thee greatly, and offer to
thee the Sacrifices of Praise, and make Vows of better Obedience: And, Lord,
having made such Vows, assist us by thy grace that we may perform them; and
cause us all our lives to carry with us, and in us, the same thoughts and
resolutions of holiness and good Conversation, which we have when we are in a
storm, and not obey thee worse after deliverances, then we resolved to do in
dangers. And, Lord, how soever thou shall please to dispose of us, we do here
cast our selves down under thy Mighty hand; We submit our selves to thee, as
the clay to the Potter, to do with us what is good in thy fight; for thou have
promised that all shall turn to good to those whom thou have chosen: And have
further showed us, that neither life nor death can separate us from thy love
that is in Christ Jesus; Let it be so unto thy servants, let thy love always
be toward us in Christ Jesus the Son of thy Love: Whatsoever Judgments fall
on our bodies, let our souls be saved by the Lord Jesus; Let us so be knit unto
him by a lively Faith, that we may be partakers of him, and in him, of life
Eternal: And having a sure hope and confidence hereof, let us desire to be
dissolved and to be with Christ, which is best of all; and at our dissolution,
speak with assurance to be heard, Lord Jesus Receive our Spirits: Hear us, O
Lord, and grant us our Petitions, and whatsoever thy wisdom knows to be best
for us, which is far beyond all that we can ask or think, and all for the sake
of thy Son and our blessed Savior, through whom alone we and our Prayers have
access unto thee; to whom with thy G^orious self, and most Holy Spirit, be all
Honor and Glory, Praise and Thanksgiving, Service and Obedience, from this
time forth, and for evermore, Amen.
