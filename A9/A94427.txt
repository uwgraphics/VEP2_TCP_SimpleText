To his Highness the Lord Protector, and the Parliament of England, etc.
Mortal Gods,
THe Eternal Being, without which nothing can be, has made of one blood all
nations of men Act. 17. 26. Men are the off spring of God, v. 29. and made in
his own image, Genesis 1. 23. and therefore God said unto our fathers soon after
the flood, Whosoever sheddeth man^ blood, by man shall his blood b^ sh^d, Genesis 9.
6. Yea, (except in some special cases) blood must be shed for the blood of a
thief: for he should have lived to make full restitution, Exo. 22. 3. And
therefore you ought to be more tender of a man's life, then of matter of estate:
and all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to y^u, ye should do even
so to them, Mat. 7. 1. And I have so much charity toward you, to hope that you
are not void of all humanity, but have some natural affection; so that if any
of your children or near relations through poverty should fall to steal, and
happen to be hanged for the value of 13 d. ob (or pressed to death for not
^peaking) it would touch you to the quick. And think you that other men's
children and relations are not as dear and precious to them, as yours are to
you? And this (...) say, not that I allow of theft, nor do I know any of my
relations guilty thereof; but only show unto you the unnatur^lness of the act
and fact of putting men to death for simple Theft; that so you may be thoroughly
sensible and sorrowful, and you hearts may be made better, Eccl. 7. ^. You know
it is a common thing to arraign men for stealing Horses; a man is hanged
ordinarily for a Mare: for your Law values not a man more then a horse: Is not
this a brutish estimation, O ye Heads of Great Britain?

You have sat now above these 40 days twice told, and passed some Acts for
transporting Corn and Cattle out of the Land, and against Charles Stuart's, etc.
but (as I humbly conceive) have left undone matters of greater concernment*
amongst which, the not curbing this overmuch justice in hanging men for
Stealing, is one; the not supp^^ssing the Pressing of men to death for not
a(...)ing against themselves, is another* And wh^t th^^k (...) of tak^ng awa^
man's life upon (...) single testimo^^* (especi^lly be^^g for such small m^tte^s
c^n you j^stfie the some before the great Law giver, who is a(...)e and to
destroy? If you cannot, then be as ^ilig^^t to make a through Reformation as I
have been (...)e Solli^i^^^ion.

W^^ ye (...) also, that it is a general grievance and open di^grace to the
Nation, that the Public debts are yet unpaid, although you are deeply engaged
by Art. 39. of this present Government? Ye know the Laws are executed with
great seve^i^y against Pick-pockets, petty thieves, and silent malefactors, who
are pressed to death for hol^ing their tongues, and are taken pro confesso: But
judge in your selves, Wh^t^^r are the greater sinners, those who steal for mere
^^^^ssity to supply their present wants, or such as defraud the old soldier of
his Pay, and the laborer of his hire, and borrow money and not pay again but
engage faith and promise upon it, give Debenters, Bills and Bonds for it, and
establish Securities to satisfy it, and afterward by force or fraud take it,
or suffer it to be taken away again; and yet again bind themselves by a solemn
O^th, as in the presence of God, that the Securities given shall remain firm
and good, and not be made void or invalid upon any pretense whatsoever* and
afterward neither regard debts nor debtors, but suffer many of them to perish,
while justice is bought and sold, and comes by a drop at a time, and does not
run down as it ought like a mighty stream: And by swearing and lying, and
killing and stealing, and committing adultery, men break out, and blood
touches blood. And for these things does the land ^ourn, Hos. 4. ^. 3.

In the land of Israel there was s^^^i^l provision made for the poor, the
fatherless and the w^dow (...)y stranger was ^ot to be forgotten in that land:
^o(...) Theft was much more to be punished ^^^n now, (...) Thieves then were
not driven to su^^ straits and c^l^mities as many now have been and a^e ^^ill
here in England, (under such rude Forms of Government) by ca^ualties, as
impotency of body, loss of estates, bad deb^s, like the Public faith and
arreres of soldiers, so much undervalued, as if the High and Mighty States of
England were broken. And God then gave free liberty amongst the Jews, for a man
to eat his fill of his neighbors field, vineyard, or oliveyard: but by the
rustical law of England, men arrest men as tresp^ssers for coming upon their
ground, and obtain Judgments against them for Costs, although there is no
damage. Such p^actices ^s these disq^iet the Land, create combust^o^s, bring
confusions, and procure work for a sort of Villain (...) Catchpoles, and employ
a company of lascivio^^* Lubbers, I mean the lying Lawyers, whose h^ads are
full of mischief, and their pens dipped in gall and wormwood* their tongues are
as sharp arrows, their teeth as swords and spears, and their throats open (...)
^^vour and swallow up the poor and needy from (...): These are like a sweeping
(...) leaving them a shilling to be a shield of de^ence* (...) in their pocket,
to encou^^^r with (...) Hunger: and so the poor men's noses are h^ld ^o ^^e
Grindstone, and their faces ground away, as may be seen by their countenances:
and the Poor's poverty comes to be their absolute destruction, and swarms of
beggars and thieves ingendered in the Common wealth by Pecunia(...)s* and the
poor man's Suit cannot go on currantly w^^^out money, though his Cause be never
so just, but (...)e a Lawyer may easily be got to speak twenty (...) ^^^^^st
him for 10 s. and cloak his lies with pret^^^^s of Clyents informations. These
things may e^sily be reformed by you, if ye will, O ye men of high degree.

And because you are the Patrons of Englands Statutes, and have power to
redress the Grievances which by your Law cannot be redressed without you; I
have presented you with these lines printed in red letters, because, though
Tophet is p^epared of old for Kings, because of their crying crimes; yet
Parliaments sins are sins red as scarlet, of a deep and double dye; and they
must be accountable to him by whom their Legislative power is limited. Repent
therefore, O Parliament of England, and be not as your predecessors the former
Parliaments. Parliaments have been Pillars of Popery, Panders to the Whore of
Babylon, abominable Idolators, propagators of Adultery and Covetousness in the
Clergy: Parliaments have been Murderers of Saints and sinners; Parliaments
have done and undone their self-denying Ordinances, been puff^d up with pride,
tyrannous toward their inferiors, slavish to their superiors, submi^ting to
force against freedom; using public fraud and private fl^ttery, to the
destruction of the people. Therefore whatsoever heavy bu^dens they bound, and
grievous to be born, you must unbinde, loosing the b^nds of wickedness, undoing
the heavy burdens, and let^ing the oppressed go free, and breaking every yoke,
so much as the putting forth of the finger, or speaking vanity.
