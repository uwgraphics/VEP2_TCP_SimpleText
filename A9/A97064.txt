TO THE FAITHFUL AND TRUE-HEARTED Covenanters, WHICH ARE THE NOBLE
Philadelphians.

A Diurnall, Of the Desires and Endeavors of one that earnestly desires the
advancement of the Cause of CHRIST.

London Printed. 1644.

To the faithful and true hearted COVENANTERS: I Desire to present unto you
this little Diurnall of my poor endeavors and desires for the advancement of
the cause of Christ, since the first call of this hononurable Parliament, which
must sit till the desolation of Popery, Idolatry and Willworship.
FIrst of all, at the Election of the Knights for Darbyshire, after the long
debating of the matter, the Town being not so convenient, they went into a
piece of ground called the Hulmes, and after some time spent there, it growing
toward dinner time, and great Dinners provided, they began to draw away; I
went to Sir John Curson, he being on the top of a little hill with Mr. Manners
and diverse other Gentlemen; where I requested these three things of them.

First, that they would not leave us till such time as we had made them sure.
Secondly, that Proclamation might be made that all those that were for Sir John
Curson, and Master Manners would repair unto them into the Hulmes. Thirdly,
that Robert Bennet who kept the Records of convicted Papists, might bring them
thither, and as the Papists came to give their votes, we would reward them
according to their deserts, and send them away; for I told them that Papists
had no vote in the election of Knights: All this was granted; and witness Sir
John Curson and diverse there, whether God in mercy did not make these requests
effectual for accomplishing of what we were there met together for: and I am
sure I was soundly threatened by some in Darbie, they telling me that I had
made the worst days work for my self, that ever I did in all my life, but if
the Lord please he can make it the best: Its true, that after the last request
was made known: Papists that came to vote for one man, whose name I omit to
mention, fled out of the town as fast as they could, I would they would pack
as fast out of the Kingdom, for they have, and ever will be enemies to the
Church of God.

And at the Election of the Burgesses for the Town of Derbie, I think my
endeavors were not wanting therein, as either one or both can witness: but
for the Recorder he turned Delinquent: for his Records I doubt they are gone,
and for the Evidences of his lands they will do him little Good, except he come
in to make his peace, according to the last Declaration set set forth by both
Kingdmes.

After this I do confess I had a long time of rest, wherein I might have
followed my calling to have advanced something for my good wife, and four sweet
children, but truly I had no power to do almost any thing but hearken for
news, concerning the good success of this honorable Parliament; The
continuation of News was such, that many said they were persuaded there would
be a speedy and peaceable Reformation, I ever replying, that if there were a
sound and through Reformation without shedding of blood, it would be such a
thing as selldome had been heard of, alleging this, that the Devil seeing his
Kingdom to begin to fall so fast, would not be wanting to stir up divellish
and Malignant spirits to do what mischief they could, and it is apparent, they
have not been wanting: But it may be truly said, that the pits they have
dug for others, they have fallen into themselves, and surely the Bishops
cannot choose before this time but to have wished that they had taken the
wholesome advice of Mr. Brightman, to have repented, and made themselves in
equal rank to their fellow brethren, and not to Lord it over Gods heritage,
they have had this forty years to repent in and yet have not repented. For it
is too well known they were like Princes, and you know, that if pride get into
the heart, it is an hard thing to get it out; and I know, that except they
repent and make themselves in equal rank with their fellow brethren, they
must fall and never rise again: As for Papists, one would think that they
before now should wish they had sat still with the third part of their
estates, and have left off plotting, and contriving mischief against King,
Parliament, and Kingdom, becuase of the ill success they have had in all
places, and at all times in their wicked and Devilish designs: but the
foudation of their Religion being laid upon the great sins of the world, that
is, Killing Christian Kings, blowing up of Parliaments, and destroying of Gods
people, which they call Heretics, it is a thing not to be wondered at: For as
the old saying is, the Devils Children, the Devils nature: But they being
fallen into the pit they dug for others, some of them, with some other
Incendiaries of the Kingdom like the Frogs of Egypt, except into the Kings
chamber, and would never suffer him to have rest, til they had gotten him to
the City of York, to take up his stands: I hearing of it went to Newarke,
where I saw his Majesty, and returned home again, I relating what I had seen,
and what I thought, namely, that I saw the King, who looked very pale, as
though he were much troubled in mind, and thought that the Queen, the
Papists, and Prelaticall faction, had prevailedd with the King to do that which
was a great trouble unto him: and I suppose here was a great beginning of the
great troubles of this Kingdom, yet here stands the comfort of Gods people,
that all things do and shall work for their good.

My next endeavor, according to my poor ability, was, to buy some Arms, which
I did accordingly, for I thought there would be great use for them, seeing a
little cloud rising in the North like unto a man's hand, which would have
spread it self over all the Kingdom, had not God in his mercy prevented it:
And herein I can never sufficiently set forth the honor due to Sir John Gell,
for his love, courage, and zeal, for maintenance of the truth, to the Town and
County of Darbie; for had but some Gentlemen made good their promise unto him,
he had endeavoureded the cloud, that no part of it had come into Darbieshiere.

But so it was, that his Majesty came to Nottingham to set up his Standard,
and the day being made known, many Darby men came thither and showed themselves
before the King in a body, for fear lest they should suffer in a good cause, I
met even then with an honest Citizen (who was my neighbor formerly in
Nottingham) that was sent as Messenger from the Parliament, the private
conference he and I had I pass by, only I showed him some reasons that it
was no hard thing with 200. men to surprise the Castle and the Magazine, that
it might destroy none of Gods people. But the Standard going up to be reared, I
went to see the manor of it; It did much resemble blood and gold, I hardly saw
any man so busy as Sir Jacob Ashley, evil Commanders matters not to shed
innocent blood, so they can get gold, neither will they be wanting to spinne
forth the Kingdoms misery: But reared it was, and after that the Cloud grew to
that greatness, that it reached from Nottingham to Darby, and so to Hopton,
where there was such a divellish storm in it, that it took away all that was
in Sir John Gells house, I think saving only a man and a maid; the news
whereof presently came to Coventrie to Sir John, and he seeing an honest
Minister, that I love well, called him unto him, and told him the news, he
answered, and said he was heartily sorry, but Sir John himself answered him
again, and protested that it did not trouble him a jot, as the Minister after
told me: truly Gods providence is much seen in diverse places, where I have
been, to keep up the hearts of Multitudes that wish well to the Cause, under
great Crosses of this nature, God is always as good as his promise, and he
will support his own people in time of their greatest troubles: After that the
King came to Darbie, whom I pray God to bless in all lawful designs, and to
make his Crown to flowrish upon him, and his posterity after him: Proclamation
was made upon pain of death to bring in all their arms, some men were
observed to carry them willingly, and others unwillingly, some honest faithful
men kept theirs, but the rest would learn wisdom of Sir John Gell, who valued
his arms more then his estate, for truly the cause being well considered, the
loss of arms in a house, is more then the loss of the house it self, and
the loss of the arms in a garrison town is more then the loss of the town
it self: For if the Devil and Papists could have had as many arms as they
would have had, what had become of Protestants before this day? But herein take
notice of the Parliaments care of the Magazine; for my own part, I would carry
in none, for my belief was and is, that arms being put into Papists hands
cannot be employed for the good of the King, Kingdom, or protestant religion.

Not very long after, Sir John Gell received Commission to be Colonel, and
then his endeavor was not wanting to the utmost of his power, to set forward
that great work, I mean the Militia, the setting whereof forward at the first
was something hard and difficult, and the harder it was the more it makes for
his honor, and I hope God will honor him for it; for those that honor God, he
has promised to honor them: After that he had broken the Ice, some others
were willing to go the same way; but it is thought by some, that had not he
been active in the business, the Commission of Array might have endangered both
the Town and County, for it is too apparent, that afterward diverse of our
great men turned Array men: and some that we thought would have been faithful
to us, by reason of their great protestations: but he that will protest he will
go to London with speed, and goes to York, What think you by him? Or he that
protests he will stand for the true Protestant Religion, and his actions
manifest the contrary? What think you by him? Surely I think you will hardly
believe him, some such as these I my self am able to witness against: The
noble Colonel beginning to set forward the Militia, I sent unto him, that if
he pleased, all the Arms I had and my self also were at his command; he
indeed did not send for them, but after he came to Darbie to be resident, some
Captains under his command had them, so they are employed in his Regiment. My
next poor endeavor was to find an horse, and arms for his rider; after this
being sent a messenger to the Committee of Nottingham, and having dispatched
the thing I went about; One whom I do much honor, Mr. James Chadwick, told me
he had a great desire to speak with me, saying that base Town of Newark did
much trouble him, and he had a great desire to go to get some forces to join
with them against it, he asked me if I would go with him to Manchester, I
answered him through the whole world, if God enable, for the advancemt of the
cause: I also told him I had been lately at Manchester, and I heard there was a
Regiment disbanded, partly for want of pay and partly for want of Employment:
The next morning we went to Darbie, and he acquainted Colonel Gell with it,
who highly approved of it, Sir said I let us neglect no opportunity, there is a
considerable force at Chesterfield, and a company of stout blades at
Sheffield, and it is not much out of the way: he agreed to it, and we went to
both places, and he wanted for no accommodation, in promise: but Sir, said I, I
cannot see how you can undertake a business of this nature, for if the Design
should miscarry, you will be in danger to be questioned, except you have the
approbation of my Lord Fairfax, he being General of the North, and said, I
hear he is not far off, and it may be you may receive a greater accommodation
there then you are aware of; said he, thou say well, but will thou undertake
the business at Manchester? Sir said I, Take no care for that, for I am
acquainted with many of the Committee there; so went thither and received an
answer of a large accommodation, after one design was past, so I returned to
him to Sheffield, as he appointed.

The next news I heard was, my Lord Fairfax had given him Commission to raise
forces in any part of the North, there were diverse Gentlemen thereabout that
had raised forces for the preservation of the Country, who took a love unto
him and desired he would be resident with them, who were all willing to come
under his command, so that by that means he had 1200. raised in a weeks
space, the like has hardly been seen in any place, Sir said I, seeing you have
received so large accommodation, the Country will expect you should do them
some good, moreover, I said, here are two petty Garrisons, Welbeck and
Boulsover which trouble them, and there are two implacable enemies to the
Truth, the Lord Davincourt, and the Earl of Kingstone: pretend as you would go
against Boulsover, and fall upon the E. of Davincourt, make him and his wealth
sure; and next pretend you will go against Welbeck, but fall upon the E. of
Kingstone, For truly said I, if they be not looked unto in time, they will do a
world of mischief; He anwsered and said it was his intent, but that he could
not as yet set upon any Design for want of Ordnance, whereupon he gave me a
Diurnall of his Endeavors, how God had blessed him, and withal sent me to
Darbie, to Colonel Gell, who was not wanting to help forward so good a work,
for he sent his Lieutenant Colonel, two pieces of good Ordnance, and very nigh
three hundred men.

The design being set upon, and Colonel Chadwick being on the top of Staley
Hall, and seeing the Ordnance to give over playing, I praid him to send a
messenger, he did so, and he brought news that we had some men slain, and
that my Lord had made his peace, and brought forth some fourscore pounds,
swearing it was all the money he had in the house, with promise of some two
thousand more, I protest said I, this will prove a second piece of Business,
for this will undo all, for I will not give two pence for that promise, if my
Lord go to Newark: I pray you, said I, let the Design be renewed again, say
but the word, and I will go and quarter all your men there all night, and we
will seize upon my Lords body, which will be much for the honor of the cause,
and if we do not find money and gold good store, to help to maintain the
cause, never trust me gain: but it was not granted, then my Lord goes to
Newarke, and three days after, sends three Troops of horse and fetched away
eight or nine horse-loads of money, gold and plate, that was hid hard by the
Communion Table, it seems some great men make an Altar of it, for it was
partly laid Altar-wise, Also Boulsover Scouts fetched away great store of Bacon,
Butter cheese and corn, which I would have had carried to our Garrison at
Chesterfield, but it was not; the design fell between two, where the fault was
I can tell, let others judge, but had the L. Davencourt, and the Earl of
Kingston been made sure, it had been better both for them and us, as the event
since has made it good but the packing to Newark of Puesey, Davincourt, and
Kingston, were as a Loadstone, that drew so many great ones, and so much money,
gould and plate with them, that has been the very subsistence of the town, so
that here you may see, that in the negligent doing of the work of God, in the
sparing of Malignants, we have been the best friends to that Town, and the
worst to our own Counties: After this Colonel Chadwick went to Nottingham to
keep the Sessions, and for Magazine, but sad news came, that the Earl of
Newcastles Forces coming, and ours going unadvisedly against them, and wanting
Orders and ski fall Commanders, were utterly surprised. Indeed I always
thought we should be crossed in our proceedings, for I often desired that the
Word and the Sword might go together, but could not obtain it, but great
accommodation in the setting forward of great Designs, requires great
humiliation, and humiliation being joined with the Sword, is the only way to
help forward a good cause, for those that have entertained faithful Ministers
in the keeping of this duty afoote, God has blessed them the best in their
undertakings, this is for the comfort of England, that God has an humble and a
praying people in it.

After this a letter came from the Parliament, and the Earl of Essex, not
only a request but a command for six Counties to join together, which was
one great and chief work of the Kingdom: Colonel Chadwick conceiving it to
be a work of such great consequence, as I my self said, it was a chief
design of the Kingdom: and as I heard Colonel Gell say, that except that
course was taken the Kingdom was in great danger to be brought to poverty:
colonel Chadwicke having a great desire to help forward this work spared
neither pains nor cost, but went from Nottingham to Darbie, from darbie we
went to Manchester, from thence to Nantwitch, and from thence to Stafford; and
to Mancester again, and so to Nantwitch: But one countey promising large, and
not performing, hindered the work for going forward. (Lankashire.) I pray God
it be not laid to their charge; But when they have all done, to quit and
demolish petty Garrisons, and to get into great bodies will be found the way
to do the work, and to save the Kingdom, for being undone: After that
colonel Chadwick went to Leeke, where the they took a love to him, and
defired him that he would be resident with them, who granted unto them: but
what was done from that time, til General Fairesax came to Leeke, I forbear to
relate, except, I be requested, we went along with the General to Manchester,
who went to raise forces for the relief of Nantwitch, the countey did
accommodate him, with a considerable force, two days were set apart together
for humiliation, and prayer, the third we marched forward; every Randezvouze,
nothing but praying and singing; not one oath that I heard in all the way,
truly it thought I was the most comfortable time that ever I had since I went
forth, although I lay upon the ground, and was glad to drink fair water; For
Gods cause was prosecuted in his own way, and he blessed it accordingly, to the
good of several counties, and the rejoicing of the Kingdom, my hearts desire,
and prayers to God, is for the General, for he is a true soldier of Jesus
CHRIST, and certainly he is guarded with a guard of Angels, God in mercy long
preserve him. The next day after the relieving of Nantwich, I was sent a
Messenger to some of the chief of them that belong to the General: After I had
delivered the Message, I requested I might move one thing unto them, which was
this; Gentlemen, said I, God has made the General and you, all faithful
instruments for the good of the Country, for the relieving of the Town, and for
the settling again of Sir William Brereton; but I fear except one thing be done,
that is the demolishing of petty Garrisons, for after the General is gone out
of these parts, they will endeavor the taking of them again, and then they
will endeavor to glean up all the provision they can, between them and
Nantwitch, that at the last, they will endanger to make them come forth for
bread: But however you will acknowledge it a great mercy to have strong holds
delivered into your hands, then cast your eyes upon this; We had Litchfield
close, Tutbury Castle, Chillington House, Biddulph Hall, Winckfield Manor, and
Sheffild Manor. Now judge you whether we have made use of Gods mercies or not;
for had these been demolished at the first when we had them, much blood had
been saved, which is and may be shed, many men's goods would have been saved,
which are and may be taken; besides, free Trading had been laid open betwixt
the South and the North: And I am heartily sorry, that the faithful Citizens
should be so much prejudiced, through our negligence; for Traffic is to the
Kingdom partly as Water is to a Mill, take away the Water, and the Mill will
do but little good: You see we have been the worst Enemies in this, to our
selves. Better it is that strong Holds were demolished, then the Kingdom
endangered. For King James himself was once in that mind, I would King CHARLES
were also, but I hope the Parliament will: For Castles or strong Holds will do
no good in this Kingdom, excepting Port Towns, but spin out the Kingdoms
misery, especially in these distracted times. Wherein you may see we have not
made such use of mercies as we might have done. God is said, to curse the
stones and timber of the house where Idolatry is committed; but you may see
what we have gotten by sparing of them. He that seeks for a petty Garrison, is
either a Coward, or seeks himself, and so far as any man seeks himself, he is
no friend to the Cause, King, Parliament, or Kingdom.

Two days after, a Messenger came to Sir William Brereton and told him, that
the Scots of a certain were come in, and said that General Lestey sent unto
Colonel Rigbey, that if there were any special design to set on, he would
send ten thousand with speed, something was said. Gentlemen said I, there is a
great providence to be observed in this, for ten thousand being with discretion
conducted into Wales, will prove very serviceable; first, for the bringing in
of those malignant Counties, for the temper of the Welchmen is such, that if a
considerable force come amongst them, they will side with them: Witness Sir
William Brereton that holy man, upon a small entrance he made, how they came in
to him, and condiscended to a Weekly pay. Secondly, they will be serviceable
to stop up the passages against the Irish Rebels; for it is reported the Queen
is going for them, and the Devil and all, to come to cut honest harmless
Protestants throats in England: if they come, I will vvarrant you the Devil
will be conducter. Thirdly, they will be serviceable in preventing Prince
Rupert or any of the Popish Army, for securing themselves, or recruting
themselves in those Counties, which they ever have and will make the chiefest
use of, if they be not prevented. Fourthly, they will be serviceable if the
Earl of Nevvcastles forces make a retreat out of the North, as it is thought
that it being too hot for them, as I believe it begins to be, they will be
ready to join with our forces, for the preventing of the spoiling of some
Counties; If the North grow too hot for him, what do you think the South
will do? But I will tell you, except he do repent of the mischief he has
done to the poor flock of Christ, he must have a hotter place then either of
them.

After this, I went to Stafford with an Order from the General; I moved a
word or two concerning the demolishing of petty Garrisons; But noble Colonel
Ridgley, being truly sensible of the Kingdoms misery, made a short Speech,
which he deserves to be highly honored for: After, I went a long journey to
know the truth, concerning the people that I have long since spoken much of,
the people of my desire, the people of my delight; I mean, the honest Scots,
which are the noble Philadelphians: for the Relation, I forbear till
hereafter. Being employed as a Messenger, and having been resident in several
Counties, some things I have observed; I will relate but little. I have heard
many aspersions cast on Colonel Gell, but he has acted like a Soldier, and
in the last conclusion, he will get more honor, than many that I know, whose
names I forbear to relate, because of their honest desires; For they that will
think to save a Country in a time of War, without raising men and money, does
as a man that takes in hand to build an house without either wood or stone:

For Nottingham they have not been wanting according to their strength, being
almost surrounded with the Enemy, they have received some loss, but I hope
God in mercy will make it up again; for the love that I bear to that town, I
could wish that the great Army that lay so long there the last Summer, and did
so little good, had spared the Town and quartered their Army about Newarke,
God in mercy send good Commanders in chief, that may faithfully set forward
the work with speed: For the right Honorable the Lord Fairfax, and that
faithful soldier of Jesus Christ his son, who is able to express their
zeal, their courage and their Faithfulness, to the Cause, and to several
counties, God in mercy preserve them, and I trust ere long he will give them
their hearts desire: And For Manchester, God was pleased to make an handful of
people to stand against a potent Enemy, and to make them the chief
Instruments, for the encouragement, in the setting forward of the Militia, let
them be highly honored for their works sake; For Sir William Brereton, he
has been a faithful Instrument of much good, God in mercy bring him safe
again into the County, for I doubt there will be need of him: For Stafford I
leave it to the judgment of Colonel Greaves, and others: For the honest and
willing Morelanders, They have fermerly suffered sore loss, not for the want
of honest, but careful and skillful Commanders, but this is for their comfort,
they have gotten more then they have lost, and in time no doubt but God will
teach their hands to War, and their fingers to fight: I will tell you now what
I could desire, it is that the King would be pleased to seal an Act for the
banishment of Papists and for the bringing of the great Incendiaries of the
kingdom to condign punishment, and then who will not believe what the King
has protested.

I could desire also that they that have taken up arms aginst this Parliament,
and yet profess themselves to stand for the Protestant Religion, that they
would restore honest people and faithful Ministers to their own cures and
habitations, and then we will have a charitable conceit of them, that they
stand for the protestant religion, but not before: I could also desire that
General Hastings would give the first president, because his Fathers house
has bin so hnourable for Religion, witness Mr. Eldersham, Mr. Ash, and diverse
others, and that he would no longer dishonor that which God has hono^ued, and
that Ashbee which is now a cage of unclean spirits, may become a place for
Gods people to assemble in as it has been heretofore: I have known him a good
Instrument for the good of the Commonwealth, and I hope God will open his
eyes, and make him one for the Church, I have heard many a prayer put up for
him, and I have heard many pray that if they were ordained to be taken
prisoners, they might fall into his hands, for the mercy that he has showed to
honest prisoners, I hope God will show mercy to him, for the promise is, that
the merciful shall obtain mercy; I have heard many say, he is the greatest
plunderer in the Kingdom, but give me leave to speak one word for him; he has
done it by virtue of a Proclamation set forth by the King; But when open war
is proclaimed against an Honorable Parliament, and proclamations issued forth,
for taking of honest men's goods, that the Kings best subjects cannot have free
traffic one with another, these things cannot but procure a judgment, but
woe be to the authors; they say plain dealing is the best, then I will tell
you that there is more Noble and Gentile Theves made in England, the last year
and this, then ever there were before, but who made them, be angry with me, if
I do not tell you: But there is some hopes, that that may be made good which is
spoken in a passage by Mr. Burton, that God will make King Charles a chief
instrument to give the Pope a deadly blow, you know there has many a petition
been put up to his Majesty; and I am sure there has been many a faithful
prayer put up to the Lord of Hosts for him: If he forsake the Papists and
return to his great Counsel, and all those that profess themselves to stand
for the protestant Religion, would join themselves in sincerity and truth of
heart, with our loving brethren of Scotland, according to their loving
invitation, in their last Remonstrance; Do not doubt of it, but the Pope will
have such a blow, as he dare never look up again in England; now what do you
think is worthy to be done to all those that will not help forward so good a
work; as Newters, and the Prelaticall faction, and those Muckwormes that
think to get all by following their callings in these distracted times, and
cannot be content but they must be prattling against the faithful Citizens, and
honest men in the Country, that are willing to spare neither time nor pains,
nor lives nor estates, but to lay down all for this Cause, that will be saying
its fitter for them to be following of their Callings at home, and look to
their wives and Children, but they would be taught what Christ says: That he
that loves father or mother, or Wife, or children, or lands, or livings, or
life it self better then him, is not worthy of him; and what David said when he
was going to fiht, and his brethren, said as these men do, that it was fitter
for him to follow his calling in tending of his fathers sheep, he answered and
said unto them, is there not a cause? Does not now lives and liberties, and all
that true Christians have, lie at the stake? And is there not a cause? So the
true calling of a Christian is to vindicate this Cause to the utmost of his
power, and ability, Christ says that he that is not with him, is aginst him,
and truly if Ordinances of Parliament, had been better executed in setthing
forward of the Covenant, and some other things, we might more clearly have
seen by this time, who had been for Christ, and who against him. It has been a
trouble unto me in some places where I have been, and a Committee of Parliament
there present, and yet these things neglected, the life of the Laws and
ordinances lies in the Execution of them, I would I could see the neglecters
punished, that do not execute the Parliaments commands, according to the utmost
of their power: in many places where I have been, I have heard some to desire
peace, almost on any terms, some again have desired peace with holiness, or
no peace, for the first, if the Parliament would have had peace with
Monopolizers, Papists, the Prelaticall Faction, and the great Incendiaries of
the Kingdom, the first had had their desire, but it is the second that must
have their desire, for let them not doubt but God will make this Parliament
chief instruments that they may enjoy Christ in the purity of his Ordinances,
and then they will have a tenfold requital for all their faithful endeavors,
for whom God gives Christ unto, with him he gives them all things, for Christ
is all things to all them than truly do enjoy him.

And you, Noble, Faithful and true hearted Citizens, that have been willing to
purchase the truth at any rate, chere up your spirits, for sure your rejoicing
draws near. I have heard many accusing the King for having the papists in
his Army, and I think not without cause, and also the Parliament for having
the Separates in their Army, For the Papists, I hope it will not be long before
an order be taken with them, and if there be any that will deny the Church of
England to be a true Church, as it stands joined to the Church of Scotland, in
worship and discipline, it being judged to be the best reformed Church in the
World; I hope the Parliament will take an Order with them, but give me leave to
speak one word for those that have been called Separates under the Prelaticall
government, you know there was so much rubbish brought into the church, that
tender Consciences could hardly get into it, but blessed be God, this
Parliament having made an Ordinance for the taking of all things out of the
Church that are offensive, and we being joined to the Church of Scotland, in
Discipline, Worship, and Government, I cannot see that any can lawfully absent
themselves from that assembly, where this is performed, but I will tell you,
what I could desire, and it may please God that some good effect may be
produced by it: It is that every faithful Minister would refuse that call
which he had by the Bishops, and be willing to be called by the faithful
congregation, or a selected company chosen for that purpose.

I could also desire, that where the Minister is called, a day of humiliation
may be set apart; That God would be pleased to enable him with guilts, for the
faithful discharge of his place: And whereas it is said that Churches were
builded by Papists, and God is said to curse the stones and timber of the house
where Idolatry has been committed, that God would be pleased to sanctify that
place for his own worship; for it is said, That all things are sanctified by
the Word and Prayer. So that where these things are performed, what is worthy
to be done to them, that will absent themselves from that Assembly?

Surely, it will not be ill taken, to desire that a special care may be taken
for the settling of a faithful Ministry, and that rather a place may stand
void, then be employed by an insufficient Minister. Land had better be untild,
then to be plowed and then sown with that which is naught. And that care may be
taken for the maintenance of the Ministry, that he that has the least, may
have sufficient. That in every particular County, those which are called
Church Livings, as Prebendaries, Parsonages, Vicarages, Tithes, Impropriations,
and all of that nature, faithful men may be chosen to collect into one; and
out of that the Ministry to have sufficient maintenance established, and the
rest to be employed for good and profitable uses: As the maintaining a Navy on
the Sea, or the bringing up or putting forth of poor Orphans, or several
stocks for the employment of the poor, or in danger of a foreign invasion: So
will that which has been ill employed be well employed, so will frivolous
suits be prevented betwixt Minister and people, and so will the Ministry have
nothing to care for, but to feed the flock of Christ, of whom they are made
overseers. So will the Gospel flourish, so will the hearts of Gods people be
chereed, so will God be glorified, so will the Lord delight in us, he will love
us freely, he will heal our backslidings, he will dwell in the midst of us,
and do us good.

I could desire that all true Christians would give the Lord no rest, till the
platform and discipline of the Church be established, according to the rule of
CHRIST, then would it go well with the Church, and when it goes well the
Church, it will go well with the Commonwealth, but not before; so will the Lord
make his promise good unto us, and our posterity after us, and our seed shall
enjoy the blessing.

I have heard some say, it is not possible that ever we should see good days,
till the King return to the Parliament; But know this, that there is nothing
impossible with God: The Parliament being the representative Body of the whole
Kingdom, it will be proved the King is present with them, and what both the
houses do conclude on, it may be truly said to be the Kings own act: The
comparison will not hold, which I heard made by a Minister in Derb^y in his
Pulpit, where he compared the King to the Sun, and the Parliament to a company
of dark confused stars, that have no light but what they borrow from the Sun:
He was active also in reading the prayer against our loving brethren in
Scotland; but from such preaching and such praying, the Lord deliver me, and
God in mercy make the King, as a Sun to cheer up and revive the hearts of his
poor people, in these dark and sad times, and as a shield to defend the true
Protestant Religion.

I will tell you still what I could desire* if I desire amiss, I pray you
pardon me; for it is from a heart sensible of the Kingdoms misery, and in love
to the Cause that the Parliament vindicates, which is for the Truth; It is,
that in all Counties, when we are Masters of the field, there may be chosen a
faithful General or Commander in chief, and in every Hundredth, an able
Colonel, and Captains proportionable, such as the Country is willing to approve
of, and to venture their lives with; and that all that profess themselves to
stand for the Cause, may be listed under those Commanders the nearest residing
to them; being all engaged in the cause, it being the public cause, and that
they may not lie by great companies in Garrison Towns (especially in Summer
aim) to consume the Kingdoms money, but that there may be preparation for
several Counties to join together in Association, with wisdom and discretion,
in prayer and humiliation, and that we may come forth with zeal and courage to
help the Lord against the mighty: And also that the covenant may be set forward
with speed, the neglecters punished, and refusers, made known; that so our
loving brethren that are come so willingly to help forward the work of
Reformation, which may be said to be next to the work of Creation may see more
clearly how to proceed; that so the Kingdom being scowred of Idolatry,
Superstition, and Will Worship, and Christ set up in the purity of his
Ordinances, then will the promise be made good; which is, of a new heaven, and
a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness; and then will the honest
Protestants, that have been willing to lay down all for this cause, take up the
Song of Moses, and sing aloud the falvation of their God. I would desire one
thing more, it is that the Book set forth by Ordinance of Parliament, be read
once a Week in our Army, for regulating our forces, and the punishing of
offenses both in Commanders and soldiers, may be made more use of. For in some
places it has not been set forward, neither Protestation, nor Covenant; and
that a Committee of Parliament and commanders there resident, I could desire
that commanders would endeavor to reform themselves, and then our Armies would
be better reformed, and some more time spared out of the Alehouse for exercise
in the house of God, and in the field; So should our camps be purged, then we
should carry none of our Achans into the camp, our loving brethren, whereby
the work may be hindered.

I will tell you that they I have so much spoken of, that the work could not be
done without them, so long desired and prayed for, I mean the noble
Philadelphians, are now come into England. The Lord of Hosts in mercy be
pleasire by night, and direct them that they may carry themselves so in this
weighty business, that all the black mouths which have been opened so wide
against them, may be stopped. If I should tell you that God will make our
loving Brethren in Scotland unto England, as a skilful Physician unto a gross
body, to purge out the corrupt humors, or as Refiners of the dross from the
gold, you will hardly believe it. Or if I should tell you of a war of
Inquiries, that God in mercy to his own people, and in justice to the wicked,
has sent and called in England a great Grand Jury, to inquire out new Senses,
troublers of the Church and Commonwealth, disturbers of Gods people, and and
that faithful Ministers and honest people, must give informations; you will
hardly believe it. Solomon says, Timo tries all things, believe it as you
find it. Surely it will not be denied but all those that are Enemies to this
glorious work of Reformation, ought to be inquired after, as Papists and the
Prelatical faction, and the Incendiaries of the Kingdom, and after such as
have spoken more or less against this honorable Parliament, and after such as
are despisers or evil-speakers against our loving brethren of Scotland, and why
not after all such as have received Commissions, and have been active in
nothing but for their own ends in seazing upon Papists and malignants goods,
and it may be honest men's too, without order from the Committee or the chief
commanders from whom they received their commission, and have not brought in
such goods to the public stock, but have converted them to their own private
use; because that, that which ought to be employed in the public cause, ought
not to be converted to a private use. And after all such, whose actions makes
it manifest, that their desires are to spin out the Kingdoms misery; as all
these have done unto others, so let it be done unto them: Cursed be he that
does the work of the Lord deceitfully, and cursed be he that keeps back his
sword from blood: Ier. 47. verse. 10.

I say unto you, get into the Covenant whilst you may, if you profess your
selves for the truth, lest it fall out with you as it did with them in the old
World: For you shall see ere long that the Cavaliers will leave the word
Roundheads, and call us Covenanters, for in calling of us Roundheads, they do
but proclaim themselves fools; as those do that gave their Votes for the
election of this honorable Parliament that stands for the truth, and since
have opened their mouths wide against them: And for those that are run away
from the truth, I pray you tell me if you think that those be not fools.

I need not tell you that there are great Armies prepared and preparing, but I
am persuaded that they are not only to knock the Pope out of England, but
Ireland, and France, and Rome, and send him halting to Avanion, whither some of
the Papists may follow him like bloud-hounds by the footing, to mourn over his
burial.

Of all things that I have desired, I pray you let this be granted, that the
duty of humiliation and prayer be not neglected, pray for King Charles, that
God would make him a faithful instrument for his glory, and the good of this
Kingdom, and that he would be pleased to take him out of the hands of his and
the Kingdoms Enemies, and send him safe to his honorable Parliament; and pray
for our loving brethren in Scotland, whom it pleased God to make such faithful
instruments for the call of this Parliament, that God would be pleased ever to
protect them, and direct them; and pray for the faithful Citizens, whom God
has been pleased to make so faithful to the Parliament to the King, and
Kingdom. Blessed are they that pray for the peace of Jerusalem, and I am sure
that they must be blessed that pray and bend the utmost of their endeavors for
an holy peace in England, Peace with Holiness the Lord send us: Soldiers be
content with your wages, and away with this base plundering; what you get from
the Enemy with your sword is your own, but if you seize upon Papists or
Malignants goods, bring it into the public stock; for that which should be
spent in a public cause, ought not to be converted to a private use. But you
will say you have no wages: I will tell you what St. Paul says, Having food
and raiment therewith be content, never desert a good cause for want of pay.
Are we not all, and all that we have engaged in the cause? Estates and and
Liberties, and Lives, and Religion, does not al lie at the stake? Stand for
CHRIST and for his cause and he will stand for you, for be you sure he will be a
better paymaster unto you then all the world can afford; for his promise is, be
faithful unto death and he will give you a crown of Life.

For my part my poor endeavors have not been wanting ever since the Militia
was set forward, neither shall it ever be wanting, God willing, so long as life
and estate shall last, I never desired pay but the Parliaments faith, and now I
have more then I did desire, for there is a promise made by both Kingdoms,
that all that endeavor to be active and faithful to this cause shall be no
loosers, so that this promise and the promise by Christ, is sufficient to
encourage all men that either have or will take up arms in this cause: The
poor endeavors and desires of one that earnestly desires the advancement of
the cause of Christ, the year 1644. wherein the troubles, and the troublers of
the Church and Commonwealth will be in turning ore. I could desire to be
satisfied in this, whether we under. Prelaticall government were not the
lukewarm Laodiceans, and also in this, that we now being joined to the
Philadelpians, in Discipline, Worship Government and Covenant, and made one
with them, and they with us, whether if we were Laodiceans, we be not now made
Philadelphians: But I will hearken to the faithful Ministry, and if it prove
truth, then ( see England is Metamorphized) and I will say to those that are in
Covenant, stand to it you courageous Philadelphians, for God will give you to
possess the very Gates of your onemies; and we shall see that the Parliament
has made use of those words, namely to buy the truth at any rate, and that the
field is purchased for us, where the precious pearl lies. I mean the pure
Ordinances of of Jesus Christ, but I will wait.

Vale.
