A peaceable Petition, OF A VERY GREAT NUMBER of Citizens of worth and
quality, presented at the Guild Hall on Monday the second of August; being
resisted unto Blood.
To the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of
LONDON, Assembled in Common Council.
The humble Petition of diverse Citizens of London.
SHOWS;
THat your Petitioners being very sensible of the great suffering of this
Kingdom by the late unnatural War, to the destruction of many thousands of
peaceable people, and ruin of many families. And at last, through Gods
goodness, having had some good hopes of a well-grounded Peace and freedom,
they now perceive their hopes likely to be frustrate, by the endeavors of some
evil minded people, which secretly labor to engage the City and Kingdom in
a second and more dangerous War, which the Petitioners pray God to prevent,
and which they shall endeavor in their places to hinder and withstand by all
lawful means, lying in them. And the next and readiest means, (as they
humbly conceive) is to address themselves by way of humble Petition to this
Honorable Court, which the Petitioners believe has power greatly to promote
and effect their desire.

Therefore their most humble suit is, that this Honorable Court would be
pleased to take into speedy Consideration what way and means may be found most
expedient for preventing of a second war, and more bloud-shedding, and to
discountenance those spirits that are incendiaries and promoters of a new
war, which will not only tend to the loss of trade, and to the cry and
rising of the poor, but also to endanger the ruin of this famous City, and
hinder the relief of Ireland. In all which you are so nearly and deeply
concerned with your Petitioners.

And they shall pray, etc.
