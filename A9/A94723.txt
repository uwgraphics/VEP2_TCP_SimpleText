Master Vice-Chancellors Speech to His sacred Majesty at his entertainment at
Christ Church in Oxfo^d on Newyeers day.
MAy it please your sacred Majesty,
that I in the name of this University, may salute your Highness with the same
words and wishes that the Noble Poet Horace once of old used to that great
favorite of Augustus, and Patron of desert, Maecenas, according to that Poets
testinmony atavis edite regibus; namely, spectaum satis est and donatum cum
rude quaeris.

Maecenaes iterum antiquo me includere ludo,
Non eadem est aetas.
Never any words ever suited our purpose with a more efficacious aptitude: for
now we may justly say in this University, non eadem est aetas, the face of
times are so wrinckled on the sudden, that they who not long since beheld them
young, fair and flourishing, look upon them now, as if thy were quite
banished their memory, they appear so decayed, aged and uncomely, as if the
Chaos were re^urned again, and the fabric of our English world shaken into a
rude and undigested mass of confusion.

And not without reason, when that all illustrating Sun of your Majesty's
Royal presence has, as it were, suffered a long and hideous eclipse, been
obvolved and surrounded with clouds and darkness, in respect of the
diminution of that light of obedience which was refulgent in the bosoms of all
your Subjects, darkened are the beams too of your Royal countenance in regard
of the absence of your dear Consort the Queen her Majesty, who has blessed
your Majesty with so many fair and hopeful pledges of your loves; so many
sweet and gracious Princes of both sexes, that they do as those in the
Psalmist, sit like Olive branches round about your table; darkened they are also
in regard of the still increasing and overflowing troubles and distractions
that so riot in your Majesty's Dominions, a stream of blood which has issued
from the bodies of your wounded and slaughtered Subjects, like a purple cloud,
shadowing the accustomed rays that used so cheerfully to issue out from your
Majesty's eyes, which now seem all to be transformed into the very Ideas of
pensiveness and sadness; so that we may with much grief of heart say of your
Grace, O quantum mutatus ab illa; How much are you altered from that King you
were, when you used before these civil wars to grace our Universitie with
your Royal presence, when naught was heard in our Colleges, Halls and Houses,
nay, in this whole City, but the voice of joy and gladness; but now, non eadem
est aetas, the gallant and learned Orations made here in entertainment of your
Majesty, are now reduced to this poor unworthy Speech of mine, the meanest of
your Highness Subjects, instead of those pregnant issues of wit and fancy
which the nimble brains of our Poets have invented to fill the Scene of your
welcome hither. Nothing is heard here at this great Festival of our Redeemers
nativity, but the tongue of mourning, the Universitie being a very theater of
silence, though we must confess our selves more obliged to the bounty of the
Almighty then any City in your Majesty's Kingdoms, in that he has blessed us
thus long with being esteemed worthy to enjoy your Majesty's presence; and so
that never forgotten benefit has a little revived and refreshed our drooping
souls; yet the sense of our neighbors sufferings comes like the ill Gemi into
our imaginations to affright them with the horror of their ghostly and hideous
countenances; Non nobis solum nati sumus, we were not worthy the Religion we
profess, if we should not have a fellow-feeling of the afflictions of our
Country and its inhabitants, who groan as the Israelites did under the
Egyptians, under the oppressive weight of their burdens, so insupportable,
that they would crack the shoulders of another Atlas to sustain them; their
burdens which comprehend the contracted weight of all miseries incident to
mortality; since all of them are charactered in this civil war. This civil
war that has robbed the Kingdom of the ancient tranquillity, the Church of
its so despised ornaments, the Subjects of their estates quite, nay, lives, and
many of them undone past all reparation or recovery by these military tumults,
your facred Majesty will be pleased to afford me an indulgent pardon for my
expatiating so much on this point of the Subjects calamity, it is not that I
dare be so disloyal, to believe any fault of it rests in your Majesty, but out
of the tender compassion and hearty consideration of their afflictions, which
we all hope your Majesty's paternall and pious care will in good time
rectify, for this particular City, but especially for the body of this
University, which this year is under my government, unworthy as I am of that
charge, had not your Majesty's comfortable and all-quickning sight removed away
the clouds that shadowed us; certamly ere this darkness had encompassed us
round about: here would have been no need of a Vice Chancellor, when there
would have been no Students to govern; no need of Schools, when there would
have been none to have been taught in them. No Science Liberal practiced in
the Colleges, whence all the Practisers were fled for fear of persecution, of
being plundered of their substances; nay, deprived (as it was probable enough)
of their lives, for being loyally affected to Your Most Excellent Majesty.

In that great desection of the Israelites from the Tribe of Indah and Family
of David, the Tribe of Levi stuck close to their rightful King, so has it in
England to your Highness, in all these domestic broils, not one of the
Clergy (but some of factious spirits) deserting your cause: The two
Universities, this and that of Cambridge, declaring themselves in your
Majesty's behalf; and surely we in Oxford had been justly branded with the
title of ingratitude, if we should have relinquished your Grace, who have
formerly, and at this present time, heaped upon us so many evident testimonies
of your Royal Benignity to us, and your dear affection to the advancement of
good literature, which as I before related, was here reduced to the last gasp,
laboring as it were for life, till your Goodness, by transferring your Person
and Presence hither, making this your winter residence, infused new life into
the languishing Academy. The Fellows of Houses now return to their chambers,
secured by your Majesty from any fear of dangers. The young Students, that
for their safeties were retired home to their fathers houses, haste back to the
Colleges, proud that they shall have the happiness to reside where they may
see the light and favor of your Royal Countetenance; So that (thanks be to
God and and your Majesty) decayed learning begins here again to respire and
reflourish.

The Romans in a noble gratitude to that great Camillus, who rescued them from
the tyranny and ruin of the Galls under the conduct of Brennus brought upon
them, would needs have conferred upon him the title of the second Romulus, the
Founder of the City, and allowed him equal honor with him. The same must
we, inspired with no less a gratefulness, tender to your Majesty, you are
our second Alured, the second Founder of our Universitie; and if to save when
lost, in some opinion, was as great an action of the Almighty, as to create
mankind out of nothing; Surely our reason must enforce us to acknowledge our
selves as much indebted to your Highness, for our preservation and
restitution, as to Alured for our foundarion and institution. And so with the
general votes of the whole Universitie, this new year I present your Majesty
in their names, with these wishes; Grace and Peace this year be multiplied
upon Your Self, your absent Queen, and Royal Progeny. May the dew fall upon
you all, and the blessings of Jacob be in your inheritance. May all these
tumultuous and civil distractions end with the beginning of this year, and
the rest of it be spent in imbalming and curing the many wounds of our English
Israel. And to conclude, may Heavens best bounty be showred down on you, its
mighty and outstretched Arm protect you. And as an humble and zealous
testimony of the Universities desires to serve Your Sacred Majesty in their
names, and as the best expression, they for the present can make of their
loyalty, I here beseech Your Highness, to accept this widows mite, cast as
this New Years Oblation into Your Treasury, this Cup with two hundred pounds
in gold, which is contained within it. It Is all, Royal Sir, our Universities
decayed debilitie has to tender as an offering to Your Gracious Hands; our
wishes desire it were an unexhaustible Indies: And so we hope the intention of
the gift will make us win favor in Your Eyes, so that Your Majesty will
vouchsafe to accept it as graciously, as we present it humbly.

FINIS.
