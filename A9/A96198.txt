Feb" 25Printed and published for the use and benefit of all her loving
Countrymen in her Kingdom and Principallity of Wales, 1647.

The VVelsh-mans public and hearty sorrow and Recantation, that ever her took
up Arms against her cood Parliament.
MAy it please all and every one that shall cast her cood and favorable eyes
upon this sheets of papers, to know and believe that all her Countrymen of
Wales by whatsoever appellations they be called, are wonderful sorry for her
late temerities and rashness, whereunto the Tivell owing her a spite led her
blindfold, for her do with tears overflowing her cheeks, and drowning her
hearts inward and outward acknowledge and confess, (which her will not do at
a Sessions, for fear of hanging) that her was very strangely deceived by
politic jeeres, flatteries, and temptations, to make walks and preambulations
out of her Countries of Wales, to kill and fight with her know not whom, and
her have cursed her self many days together in Welsh for being such simple
puppies, to be carried away by witch-crafts as her thinks, and as it will
appear in her lamentable and pitiful recantations, which her do now intend to
make out of the coodnesse of her Prittish blood, and valiant disposition a
great while ago, her was persuaded to put on her Arms, and to march with
crete courage and magnanimesties upon crete business, and matters of high and
generous consequences as are conceived to condust and bring her cood and
gracious King to her Parliament, and that his person might be secured from all
indignities and injuries, for which her will spend her best plood in her
pellies, her being true Britain and love her King and Prince with all
integrities, and all her hearts, but after her had consented to go in warlike
fashions, her was led away in a fools paradizes, to fall by the swords of her
enemies, and to make her appearances in Kenton, Naseby, and many other Battles,
where there was nothing but killing and slaying of all persons, without respect
of degrees and petidegrees, and ancient Gentlemen and Lords were in as much
pericles and dangers as her poorest Contrymen; Lord bless us, Guns went off
like a clutter of hail stumbling down from her old Regiments in Wales, when
her cosen Boreas swaggers and domineers on her Mountains, and was crete
deluges and overflowings of blood which was spilt, to make the ground blush for
inhumanities and merciless cruelty, and bullets flew about her ears as
commonly as if her should have told her some tale, and bid her beware, but her
could not take heed of her coming, but those round pellets hit her in
invisible miraculous manners her know not how, but her Countrymen was killed
and slain, and dyed like rotten Muttons, before her could make her Inventories
and Wills to aule her loving couzens, her was stroke dead without giving her
leave to send commendations of her self and her valor to her Contrymen:
and Saint Winifreds Well could not flow in greater big streams then her saw
plood run in streams mingled with vulgars and Shentlemens plood, her could not
know her consanguinity nor her Cozen, gentle blood, but was aule running out of
her veins and pellies, her cannot make terrible descriptions of awle those
cruel fights, and horrible battles, which her was spectators and beholders of,
but her can tell, that her was never put into such astonishments, and
amazements in all her days, for her cannot with all her fancies and
imaginations set out her pictures, and deadly representations of this hot
skirmish, her know not about what, but mere piples, and papiles, and words,
such as her never knew about Pregorgatives, and Commissions of Array, her do
not know, but her was ready in her breeches to bewray her self, and sometimes
for very fears and affrights it run down her heels, as if it had been
three-penny new ale, such a work it did make, and that without authorities, but
upon plain necessities and fears and frights, but her is now in all humility
and submission ready and desirous to crave pardon for her following and obeying
the Commission of Array; her thought like the poor dog, that her was going to
a break fast, when her was going to hanging, her thought to have marched out of
her Country, only to bring her King and Parliament to meet lovingly, but by
the way, many thousand tivels met us, and spit fire against us, and sent us
such hot answers, as bounce bounce, that her was almost deaf, and was lamed in
all her senses, so that her thought her should never hear her Welsh harps more
melodiously playing: and besides the sin oak of Gunpowder spoiled her
stomach, that her did wish her had been tosting cheese by the fireside in her
own Country, there her could fight at country Machets, and crack her Couzens
crown, and he took it for good payment for a Welsh Runt: But here at Keinton,
Naseby, and Newberry, our crowns were cracked, and yet they would not be
content, but we must pay our dear lives, and keep us from running home to
Wales, though our legs was as cood and better then their hearts. Her was truly
conformed before her went out of her Country, that her should get honor and
crete store of pillage, and cood pay for her labor, by Gods plutra nails, her
had such cood pay, that her desire never to be so paid again, the Red-coats did
so pay her, that her was fain to run from her pay, mark her that now, her
could have found better occupying at home, and better payment made there, then
her did at this Keinton, Newbery, and other battles, for her lost one arm, and
almost one leg, insomuch, that her shall never deal truly, nor go uprightly
with her best friends,; Yet her do much thank her Fates in that her has but
one hand, for now her can pilfer and steal but half so much with one, as her
could before with two, and so her should not be hanged so soon as her should,
if her had two hands.

Her was likewise drilled to Coventry, and it was told her that it was a very
rich Town, and cood store of pillage was therein, and that her should have fine
shorts and fine sheets, her must confess that put her into some heart to get
some shirts, for her had never an one of her back, but a couple of nimb'd
napkins tacked together, and so put upon her shoulders, and with never a
sleeve, and those her wore 4. months, insomuch that her had near threescore and
two Moabites about her, besides Nitites and Jebusites, which leapt like our
Welsh goat over the pales and over the mountains, when we hunt her for venison.
And some of them were grown gray with old age, others with a long red list
down their backs, others black all over, as nimble as a spirit, but the
divellish back-biter of all the rest was the gray Moabite; ten thousand civels
take em. And for her running away, her think is very cood wisdoms, for her do
remember her Welsh proverb, de huma comr a^ bo in daneth whee, that is, one
pair of legs is worth two pair of hands: yet her can shustifie that her
Countrymen did not face about and run away the first, but did stoutly stand to
it, and for her part, her did but wink twice in shooting thrice her gun off
with a pellet in it, but her was in such a sweat with it, as if it had been St.
Taffies day when all her cheeses are set to the fire to roast for joy.

And her tell her that for her own credit, that it was the Englishman that
first run away, and it does much rejoice her heart to hear, that not only some
of her Countrymen run away, but that diverse English Captains not being content
to run away on foot, but rode away like Cowards upon their horse backs, and
with the Parliaments money also, bidding their soldiers shift for themselves,
for they were all lost men. Nay her do caknow them very well, there was one
Captain Ramsey and Captain Frith, and that stout pot Captain Sir Faithful
Fortescue, which her will rather call Faithless Fortescue, who durst not come
up to her enemies face, but winked and shot of his pistol in the ground, and
run away without her word of command, and another Hobhardy Captain cal^ed
Richard Parker, who looks like bul-beef, and would have frighted her with her
looks, her do warrant her, but he like a ^^oward run away, and did not like an
honest man go through-stitch with his work such a rascal would be hanged if
her was in our Country, yet her would not have him hanged, for that would
spoil his whistling, for if all run-awaies should be hanged, what would become
of her none self: But her would have him marked for a white-liver'd slave, and
where her had a horse of 12, l. price, her should have one of 12. s. the next
time, and her Lord General should serve the soldiers as her cozen Julius
Caesar did when her first entered England, brought all his men in ships, and
when he had landed them, commanded the ships to be sent home again, so that
they had no hope left of running away, but to stand to it, and fight like men,
or dye like cowards; So her would have her Parliament let none of her Captains
have horses above 10. s. price, that if they offer to fly or run away, they
may soon be overtaken, and punished, or so branded that they may be taken
notice of for fugitives: for her own part (alas poor Taffie) all that her
could get for guarding up her King to the Parliament was the loss of one of
her arms, and almost one of her legs, the Tivell take her Commission of Array,
and her also, if ever her fight again for the Array, for it made her in a
woeful case, I would I had her stones between her anvill at home, that first
invented or found out the Commission of Array, but will conclude, as her cozen
Sir Francis Jones did upon the Sessions house bench when her cozen was
condemned to be hanged, he starting up hearing her Countryman cry for mercy,
said it is well you escape so too, so say I, it is well I escaped so too, and so
her will march home to her own Country, and make some new Alminacks and
Prognostications from year to year hereafter.

The Welsh-mans new Oath.
IN considerations therefore of the premizes most bloody and cruel, beyond all
comparisons and stories of all ancient fights, we the old Britains do here,
from the bottom and top of our hearts, which do trouble her yet to think on
that battle, do here promise and take an hundred oaths upon Books, that we
will never hereafter be so mad as to go a gathering of wool, or wealth, or
moneys, upon the ways of pillaging and plundering, and getting good estates,
and apparel, by the Commission of Array, her will rather go in her country
habit, rather then to venture for the cood apparel and get nothing but
knocks, nay and loose her life, and march barefooted, against her cood
friends, the Parliaments forces, and her desire tat te Parliament would not
take their forwardness to assist these Commissioners of Array and her King, as
a contempt against all her honors and urships, for her will hang her self, if
ever her be seduced and led away to look our Army in the face again, or to
fall to blows i^ open field, where her plood was like to have been shed, ha^
not her being wiser then the rest, run away, and so having escaped with her
life, and made this Recantation, and does desire* all the worships of the
Parliament, to pardon her crete temerity, and errors in standing for the
Commission of Array and her King, her do vow and make Protestation, that
hereafter her will be wise and discreet in the effusion of her true prittish
blood and will upon all occasions handle her arms and legs in defending the
Protestant Religion, be they what they will and her King, Parliament, and
Country, this is her true Resolution and Recantation, and hearty sorry that
ever her took up Arms against her cood Parliament of England.

FINIS.
