The Picture of an English Antic, with a List of his ridiculous Habits, and
apish Gestures.
Maids, where are your hearts become? Look you what here is!


1 His hat is fashion like a close-stoole pan. 2 Set on the top of his noddle
like a coxcombe. 3 Banded with a calves tail, and a bunch of riband. 4 A
feather in his hat, hanging down like a Fox tail. 5 Long hair, with ribands
tied in it. 6 His face spotted. 7 His beard on the upper lip compassing his
mouth. 8 His chin thrust out, singing as he goes. 9 his band lapping over
before. 10 Great bandstrings with a ring tied. 11 A long-wasted dubblet
unbuttoned half way. 12 Little skirts. 13 His sleeves unbuttoned. 14 In one
hand a stick, playing with it, in the other his cloak hanging. 15 His breeches
unhooked, ready to drop off. 16 His shirt hanging out. 17 His codpeece open,
tied at the top with a great bunch of riband. 18 His belt about his hips. 19
His sword swapping between his legs like a Monkeys tail. 20 Many dozens of
points at knees. 21 Above the points of either side two bunches of riband of
several colors. 22 Boot-hose tops, tied about the middle of the calfe, as
long as a pair of shirt sleeves, double at the ends like a ruff band. 23 The
tops of his boots very large, turned down as low as his spurs. 24 A great pair
of spurs, gingling like a Morrice-dancer. 25 The feet of his boots 2 inches
too long. 26 Two horns at each end of his foot, stradling as he goes.
