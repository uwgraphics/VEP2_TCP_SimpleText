A True and Lamentable story of one Thomas Holt of Coventrey Musician, who
through Covetuousnesse and immoderate love of money, sold himself to the
Devil, and also of his most lamentable end, on the 16. of February. 1641.
Mark Gentle Reader, for thine own good, and the comfort of thy soul, the
damnable effects of Covetuousnesse and distrust of Gods never failing
providence.

This man the sad subject of this little treatice was a Musician in Coventry,
whom for his skill in his Art and profession few or none could compare with
him, by which he gained not only the love of many Gentlemen thereabouts; but
also a competent estate to himself: God moreover to enlarge his blessings if
grace had caused him so to think of it, gave him nineteen children, which the
Holy Ghost by the mouth of the Prophet David does manifest to be great
blessings, for says he in the Psalms, Lo children the fruit of the womb are
a blessing, and an inheritance that comes from the Lord; But he to the
contrary thought them to be curses, and distrusting Gods providence thought
that he who does and is able to provide for all the creatures on the face of
the Earth, yea and feeds the young Ravens that call upon him, was not able, or
if he could, yet he would not afford means to maintain and provide for those
children which he had given, but indeed as it is so it will be an infallible
truth that infidelity and miserable belief, are the grand and sole
ringleaders to damnation, and to these he joined Covetuousnesse, which indeed
is a root upon which many great sins are branches, for he that will be
suddenly rich, must enter into diverse tentations; The first which is
Infidelity, and so misbeliefe, that if we believe any thing, yet we believe
not what we ought to believe, because we want the ground of it which is faith.
Now the want of this faith makes us that we cannot apprehend that saying which
God once said to Abr^ham in the 17 of Genesis verse 1. where he says, I am the
Almighty God, and therefore all su^fici^nt, but what follows, thou must says
God if thou will have me to be all sufficient unto thee, walk before me, and
^^^erfell: It Is true, this persection was in Abraham because he had faith to
bel^^^^ Gods promises, but how can this perfection be in him who can neither
believe God nor his promises: but before speak any more of this I shall think
it fit to say some thing of the damnable contract between the Devil and the
wretched subject of my discourse, the truth whereof is too apparent, and
indeed I could wish that no such truth had caused me to set a pen to paper,
and to condole that late and yet too soon, and by him ever to be lamented,
hard unfortunate and graceless act, is now too late, but that every Christian
who is yet alive that shall chance to take a perusuall hereof, I have
endeavored to relate a Real truth and no more, as just information has been
given me.

It has plainly appeared both by his wife and other creadible neighbors, that
upon the 16 of February Last past; which to their sorrow and loss, some of
them are forced to Justify, there arose a mighty and tempestuous wind, from
morning till night, by reason whereof some had their houses blown down,
others their reeks of come and hay served in like manner, and inconclution many
had loss and wrong, the very day this wretched man perceiving his time to be
but short and almost drawn to a period day; too his cost, to soon being
spent, and night approaching he repaires to his death bed, his wife with him
also, wherein long he had not continued but he called his wife, desiring her
to fetch him Pen Incke and paper, professing that he must not delay but
forthwith make his last will and testament. His wife wondering at this his
sudden and unexpected resolution half amazed, and suppossed it had been
rather in jest then earnest, she seemed to procrastinate and delay the time,
but he absolute in his determination urged her forthwith to dispatch, saying
that by and by a man would come and knock at his door to speak with him but
says he deny me, and say I am not at home, his Wife to sulfill his desire not
knowing the event or the cause that moved him there unto, went to fetch him
those things he asked for, which being no sooner brought, but before he could
make use of them the unwellcome messenger he last speak of came and knocked at
his door, I am quoth he now I doubt prevented the man is come bnfore I can
dispatch the thing I meant to have done, but howsoever deney me if it be
possible.

Down then went his Wife from her Husband to the door, unto which when she
came, she found a man, and a handsome man as she thought, who said to her thus,
(woeman) where is thy husband: the woeman replied Sir he is not now at home;
Nay woeman quoth he deney him not for that is in vain, for I know that he is
now in bed, and I must and will speak with him.

The woman unwilling to with stand a known truth gave him leave to enter the
house, and showed him where her husband was, unto which place when he came,
their was straight some private conference betwixt them, the woman his wife then
present, pondering in her mind, the cause of such sad and solatery passages,
she perceived to be between them, at last this infernal feind after their
damnable discourse ended, changed his assumed shape and appeared to the woman
what indeed he was, the woman at her husbands end, being almost driven to her
wits end, ran down the stairs to call her neighbors about her but before
she or they came, the man by that murdering feind the devil, was at once
robed of his life here, and much to bedoubted of his life heareafter, and at
the return of his wife and neighbors they found this miserable Caitife dead
in his bed, with his neck broken, to the terror of the beholders, he had in
his life time a Chest wherein he would never suffer neither his wife nor any
child he had to look in, which after his death was opened and found filled to
the topp with Gould, as they thought, but being once touched it fell to dust, I
speak not here of the number of years that the Devil gave him to live,
because to none but him self it was Known I might say something of his course
of life but that is needles, for it is easily understod that his life is
abhominabl whose death is Damnable, so then, and mark whosoever thou art that
give thy self to covetousness and will not the Lord to be suffitient for
the mark also what it has wrought in many others, and make them an example to
thy self, I could instance many but I will speak only of these as pertinent
to this occasion, the first is that arch traitor Judas who because he could get
no more, would under value his Lord and Master and rather then he would go
without money, would sell him though it were but for thirty pieces of silver,
a second is that Ananias who through covetousness and to save his money would
not stick to lie though it were against the Holy Ghost.

A thir^ is that covetous Acan who could not rest till he had stolen the wedge
of gold and the Babilonish gar^ent.

Another of the same nature we may read of Ahab who lay groaning upon his bed
sick and would not eat bread till he had the Vinyard of Nabeth, and rather
then his purpose should be of none effect, he would by that wicked instrument
Iesebell his wife, cause him to be stoned to death.

But what was the end of these covetous wretches; for the first, he came and
made abare confession of his fault but wanting Grace went away and desperately
hanged himself, another with his wife also which is not here expressed, at the
rebuke of one of the Apostles for lying against the holy Ghost was suddenly
smitten dead.

A third for his theft and unjust desires was for the same ajudged to be stoned
to death.

The fourth and last for that he sold himself to work wickedness, was by the
just decree of Almighty GOD, strangely shot into the body as he fate in his
Chariott, by which mortal wound he died.

O! the folly and madness of many men, who sell their souls eternal
happiness for a few temporal and fading pleasures, but if they would consider
with me these two things certainly it would be a large motive to reduce men
from prizing temporal things at so high a rate, as many now a days do.

O! that man would consider the eternity of his soul which because it is the
breath of GOD it cannot dye, but must live everlastingly in either weal or
woe, now if it depart the body under the wrath and curse of GOD, in what
miserable estate does the body leave it; and so to it is cost will one day find
it, for this is true, that as death leaves a man, so Judgment will find him.
For it is an old saying that as the tree falls so it lies, for after death
Repentance is no whit prevalent, for then we shall repent for nothing, but this
that we repented no sooner, for such will be the extremity of pain in that
lake of fire and Brimstone whereby the soul shall be so distracted that it can
think of nothing but execrations, blasphemies and the like; Now it is
eternity that ads fuel to this fire, for so often as the Soul thinks of this
little word (ever) it is a Hell in the midst of Hell, Nay it is a very Hell it
self. O! the heavy doom of the just Judgment of Almighty GOD, who as he
has not limited his mercies to his elect, so he has not set or appointed an
end of punishment to the Reprobate, but so far is their misery from ending,
that it is ever but beginning, now then let those damned soul selling witches
Conjurers, and such like, duly consider the miseries of eternal death,
consider it I sayall you that forget GOD, least suddenly his wrath break out
upon you and heteare you in pieces whilst there is none to help you, consider
also that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, for
he is a God of pure eyes, and cannot behold innequitie with any the least
consent or liking, but will punish it either here or hereafter, though in his
dearest Children.

But that no man should despair, let him know that as God is a just God, so he
is a merciful God also, for his mercies are above all his works, for let the
wicked sorsake his finne, and the unjust man his dealing, and let him return
unto the Lord and he will have mercy upon him, and will abundantly pardon,
therefore forsake finne, and fear not but thou shall find mercy, upon which I
wish every man to rely.

FINIS.
