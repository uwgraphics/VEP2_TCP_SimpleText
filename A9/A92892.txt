HERALDRY EPITOMIZED: CONTAINING A Short and Easy Way to Attain that ART,
Explained in diverse EXAMPLES: Illustrated with Variety of COATS of ARMS, Not
only of the Families of the NOBILITY and GENTRY, But also of COUNTRIES, CITIES,
Corporations and Fraternities.

Collected by JOHN SELLER.

London, Printed, 1682.

HERALDRY.
HEraldry is an Art rightly prescribing the true knowledge and use of Arms, and
consists in Blazoning and Marshalling.

Blazon is taken either for an Explication of Arms in apt and significant
terms; or else for a display of the Virtues of the Bearers of Arms.

Marshalling is the conjoyning of diverse Arms into one Shield or Escutcheon,
etc. And Arms (says Cambden) are Ensigns of Honor Born in Banners, Shields
and Coats, for notice and distinctions of Families one from another, and are
descendable as hereditable to Posterity.

Arms in this sense have been of great Antiquity in the world, as appears from
Sacred Writ: Particularly from Numb. 2d: wherein every Tribe of Israel was
commanded to pitch his Tent under the Standard of his Fathers House.

Ensigns of Honor among Military men, have been anciently used in this
Kingdom; and the Coats that are now born by the Nobility and Gentry, are
visible signs of their Nobility, and shortened Symbols of the Heroical actions
of their Predecessors: And the several Divisions of their Shields, ought to
show the Wounds and Cuts received in many various Acts and Heroical
Achievements of their Progenitors, which from them has been descended down to
their Posterity; which principally took its Rise from their Services in the
Wars in the Holy Land, wherein several Christian Nations were engaged; every
one under their several Banners: As,

The English displayed a Red Cross on a white Field:

The French and Portugals under a white Cross in a Blew Field:

The Irish, a Red Cross in a yellow Field.

The Spaniards, with a Salter Cross trunked in a white Field:

The Scots with St. Andrews Cross, white in a Blew Field.

And the more particular bearings in the Holy Land, was the Cross Crouched and
Crossed, of infinite Varieties, as may be seen in all Military Orders of
Chivalry and Knighthood: So that all those particular Families, that did signal
Service there, have their Shields adorned therewith: As Escalop Shells,
Pilgrims Scrips or Staves, Saracens heads, etc.

Every Coat of Arms ought to consist of both Metal and Color, having some
Analogy of the Body and Spirit of the Bearers, represented by the Field and
Charge; Rendered in the proper Language of Heraldry, which is called Blazon.

The Metals, Colors and Furs are represented in the first Plate of this
book, each of them expressed by several Hatchings of Lines: As, Or, is expressed by
Pricks and Points; Argent, plain, etc. As may be seen under their respective
titles: All which are Common Fields in Heraldry, and are subject to Division
and Charge: Only observe the Vary, is Armor of it self, being always Argent
and Azure.

An Explication of the Divisions of several Shields with their Significations.
FIrst, of the Cross, being the most worthy of all Bearings, noting all Divine
and Moral Virtues.

The Second, is a Chief, which though it consists but of one Line, yet is the
Emblem of Fame, who bears her Head in the Clouds, Representing a Head, a
Chief, a Commander.

The Third is a Fesse, signifying Resolution to action, and is a Military
Girole, going out to Conquer.

The Fourth, is called a Bend, signifying an old Soldier, and represents the
Baltheum Triumphalis, worn by those that have Conquered.

The Fifth is a Pale, Representing a Military man in a standing posture,
denoting Vigilance and Diligence, and is as a Colomn or Pillar erected to the
Memory of deserving Men.

The Sixth, is a Cheveron, and denotes an Established House, one that does
enjoy the Spoils of Arms gained in Wars.

The Seventh, is the Saltier, which is an Engine of Manhood to assault or gain,
per Saltum, and denotes a Politic Soldier.

The Eighth is an Escutcheon, representing the property of a good man, who
labors to keep a quiet Conscience in his Breast.

The Ninth Ordinary, is the Bar, which is never single, and are of the nature
of the Scarf worn about the Neck, Arm or Middle: Denoting such as either with
Arms or Council defend their Nation: Two Bars representing Love and Honor.

When a Field is Charged by these Lines drawn straight or thwart, do constitute
certain honorable Ordinaries, as being Ordinarily used, and are called
Ordinarij.

The Differences of the several Brothers are to be placed on the several
Escutcheons, with their significations.

The Shield being charged with Living Creatures, and principally with the Lion
the King of Beasts, in their several Postures, are presented as follows:

First, The Lion Couchant, signifies Vigilance, and an Illustrious Hero.

Secondly, Rampant, Magnanimous, Noble. Thirdly, Passant, Resolute. Fourthly,
Passant, Guardant, Prudent. Fifthly, Saliant, Valiant. Sixthly, Sejant,
Advised. Seventhly, Regardant, Circumspect. Eighthly, Double-headed, Politic.
Ninthly, Double-Queiv'd, Strenuous.
And which you may see answered to the several Figures in the Plate, where the
Helmets are expressed.

And, because Man as he is the head of the whole Creation, so to bear the Head
of any thing is accounted the most Honorable: And what is gained by Labor and
Pains is to be preferred: As the Erased Head is more of Military power than the
Couped; the one being torn off, and the other cut off.

Cantons have place among Augmentations: As in the Institution of Barons, each
wearing an Escutcheon, or a Canton charged with a sinister hand Gules: And when
one Escutcheon is born on another, it signifies that the Husband has Married
an Heiress General, and having Issue by her, it is Quartered by the Son, to
show that the Right of her Inheritance is transmitted from her to him: But if
she be not an Heiress, he may but impale the Coat on the sinister side, which
is called Baron and Feme: As for the outward Ornaments of Mantles, Helmets and
Crests, with which the Coats were called altogether Atchiavements.

Of the diversity of Helmets.
THe Helmet is for the defensive part of the Head, representing Council; and
are thus distinguished, as may appear in the 2d Plate in the Book.

The First is that of an Esquire or Gentleman. The Second is that of a Knight.
The Third, is that of a Baron Guard Visure, placed in that Ciroulus Aureus,
which the King has conferred on Barons of the Realm with six Pearls only. The
Fourth, is that of a Viscount, consisting of the whole Circle of Pearls. The
Fifth, is that of an Earl. The Sixth, that of a Marquess. The Seventh is that
of a Duke. The Eighth is that of a Prince.
And the Ninth is that of a Sovereign, which is the Highest.

And for the Manner of Blazoning Coats of Arms, you shall find herein several
Examples: As in the Second Plate answering to the several Figures; and the
Escutcheon No 1. Is thus Blazoned: He bears Sable, a Fesse Dancette Sable, by
the Name of Vavasour.

The Escutcheon No 2. is thus Blazoned: He bears Argent on a Canton Sable, a
Lions paw erased in Bend, Or, by the name of Bowthby.

born a Pale and a Bordure, that then you must mention the Pale before the
Bordure. The Escutcheon No 16. is thus Blazoned: He bears Argent a Fesse and
Canton Gules: This Coat of Armor pertained to the Honorable Family of
