portrait of Charles II

The Second CHARLES, Heir of the Royal Martyr;
Who, for Religion, and His Subjects Charter,
Spent the best Blood, that unjust Sword e're died,
Since the rude Soldier pierced Our Savior's Side
Who such a Father had, art such a Son,
Redeem Thy People, and assume Thy Own.
JOHN OGI^^^
