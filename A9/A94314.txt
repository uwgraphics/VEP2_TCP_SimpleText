Mr. John Goodwins Hymn.
1.
PRepair, make ready, oh ye Saints
Jehovah is come down,
To you and on your Heads to set
Salvation as a Crown.
2.
Into your mouths a Song he has put.
A Song of praise, to him, to give,
A Song of joy great store.
3.
Look, see and behold, how like himself
He Is come to visit you,
He came down, the lofty heavens
He made to stoop and to bow.
4.
With zeal all clad, as with a Cloak,
With vengeance Garments dyed,
A Helmet of Salvation
He wore upon his head.
5.
Of Righteousness Jehovah-like
A Breast Plate he put on,
And thus in fury great he falls
Your enemies upon.
6.
And home then repays them all the wrong
Which they unjustly had,
Unto you done, and threatened more
to do as they were mad.
7.
Those Northern mountains which themselves
Had lifted up so high,
With opened mouths against the Heavens
their strength to magnify.
8.
With heat of indignation
He melted at your feet,
And to your Armies gave the strength
Their Forts and Glory great.
9.
They fled they ran, they made great have
From the presence of your God,
When he is angry with his foes
There is no safe abode.
10.
One chaste man a thousand can pursue
Ten thousand put to fight,
For God was in the midst of you
And taught your hands to flight.
11.
And in their heads unrighteousness
And cruel Councels were,
which caused their hearts to sink like stones
Their hands hung down for fear.
12.
They fled they ran, they wondered here
And there seeking to hide,
Their guilty heads in holes of death
Lest they should be discry'd.
13.
For great were the numbers they had
Enough by sword to dye,
Enough to run, enough to come,
Into Captivity.
14.
Great were the multitudes they had
Thousands by sword to dye,
Thousands to run, thousands to come,
Into Captivity.
15.
They fled, they ran, but lost the spoil
To be divided by,
Them of the household they despise
And drawn to slavery.
16.
They fled, they ran, right sore afraid
To come into deaths bonds,
Your Legs redeemed your feebled knees
of their dismai'dd hands.
17.
They fled, they ran beyond the line
Of their latter confidence,
The Forest of the Land and Sea
They left to your Conscience.
18.
They fled, they ran, but they soon wheel
and chains they left behind,
With their deforrm'd devotion
Your Liberties to bind.
19.
Oh you redeemed of the Lord
To whom the silver wings,
And golden feathers of the Dove
Are now given to your mind.
20.
Who are delivered from making pitts
And diudging in the Clay,
For whose blessed sakes Kings scattered are
And turned out of the way.
21.
Of their swollen thoughts and proud desires
Are sent to the Wilderness,
To seek a way where no way is
To free you from distress.
22.
You whose Taskmasters fierce and cruel
Your glorious Lord has troubled,
And in performance of your power
Their shame and sorrow doubled.
23.
For that with enlarged hearts
and heightrod streams of spirit,
You love and fear him all your days
And cause him to inherit.
24.
The praises of the earth in words
Where ere you come and go,
No rest accept of yours gave spirits
Until the world shall know.
25.
By your good words and works relate
The goodness of the Lord,
Make the world unto your feast
You blessedness afford.
26.
Give plenty of it unto those
Who feed in misery,
And know not how to serve the Lord
In their free liberty.
27.
Thus let thy enemies O Lord
Thus let thy enemies perish,
But if that love thy glorious
For ever let them perish.
FINIS.
Mr. Powels Hymn.
1.
TO Christ the only King of Saints be praise eternally,
Which gave his Soldiers great honor
And Kingly Victory.
2.
Whom Satan would wisely subdue
To those which are his enemies,
Lest therefore offer unto him
A willing secrasie.
3.
For he in love laid down his life
and for us shed his blood,
To reconcile us to God
Who is our best beloved.
4.
And does adopt us to himself
His children for to be,
And has given us his free grace
And excellent Glory.
5.
The Lord also, his Saints exalt
That they on high do reign,
And makes our Enemies to know
That Christ is our Sovereign.
6.
The Pope, the Priest, the Antichrist
The Kings do quake for fear,
For Christ into his Throne does come
His glory does appear.
7.
Awake, arise, o King o Lord
Let all thy proud foes fall,
Then we which are thy Church on earth
will honor thy great name.
8.
Come quickly, come Lord Jesus Christ
Thy Saints do wait and stay,
To see thy Kingdom here on earth
And to to behold thine eyes,
9.
The glory and the Victories
which thou of late did give,
does move us for to praise thy name
and for thee to be beloved.
10.
That we being thy thy people all
And Saints, with one accord,
Shall with all hope and courrage free
Sing praise to thee o Lord.
FINIS.
Mr. Appletrees Hymn.
1.
LEt God arise, now up he is
As all the world may see,
To take his peopls part, wherefore,
March to revenge all we.
2.
That work which did occasion us
This day to set apart,
So great it is, it to discribe
No man has got the Art.
3.
Our Enemies which in battle fell
Long since us threaten did,
Us to anoy which did procure
Our Armies march with speed.
4.
From London, and from other parts
where they well quartered were,
To seek and for to find out those
That sought to work our snare.
5.
Before they went, to God they called
Whose cause they were to plead,
To the Church they also sent
That they would intercead.
6.
That so together, they might prevail
With God so them to direct,
To guide them in his ways
Their persons to protect.
7.
When they had passed by Barwick
And toward Haddington did come,
Thy Saints did sing, in gladness they
Would fight with all and some.
8.
Our Armies, they prudentially
Did seek that place to gain,
Where siting down, they waited long
To fight, but all in vain.
9.
Much hardship they did undergo
Their Enemies for to find,
But those men that make great host
To Engage had no mind.
10.
To Musleborough the enemy came
Our Armies for to outbrave,
Upon our works immediately
Sought something to atchive.
11
Fifteen select Troops of the Church
All Covenanters sore,
Came trooping forth, and some did swear
That Cromwells Honor to prove.
12.
Dead or alive their prisoner
Some cried they would him bring,
And offer him a sacrifice
Unto their new-made King.
13.
But God our Lord who heard their brags
Them disappointed there,
Our Army there did many kill
The rest all ran for fear.
14.
Their Horse, their Spear the Lord did break
Great mischief to prevent,
Their further hurt did make to cease
Their deeds for to repent.
15.
Our Noble General also sought
With love them to overcome,
Professing that nothing they did
Should his intentions turn.
16.
But nothing could with them prevail
To stay them from the same,
Though fight they durst not at all
Until they had their aim.
17.
And brought us to such straights that we
No way escape could make,
But must yield to their terms and glad
What they would give to take.
18.
Then God appeared himself and did
Our Soldiers courage raise,
And gave them Victory so great
For which we will give him praise.
19.
As in the days of Sisera
The Stars for us did fight,
The Moon to them was darkened
But gave to us her light.
20.
Four thousand killed was on the place
Ten thousand prisoners were,
Their bag and baggage they forsook
And did their Ordnance spare
21.
Their Cullers they did leave behind
In number great to see,
Edenborough and Leith they also quit
And did to Sterling flee.
22.
In which they trust to this day
Their King and Covenant,
Not fully able them to free
As all the World may grant.
23.
But we will trust and praise our God
That this great work has wrought,
That in our strength delivered us
When we by prayer did seek.
FINIS.
