A PSALM SUNG By the PEOPLE, before the BONE-FIRES, Made in and about the City
of LONDON, On the 11th. of February.
To the Tune of Up tails all.
COme lets take the Rump
And wash it at the Pump,
For it is now in a shitten case:
Nay if it hang an Arse
Weel pluck it down the stares,
And roast it at Hell for its grease.
Let the Devil be the Cook
And the roast overlook,
And lick his own fingers apace;
For that may be borne,
(If he take it not in scorn
To lick such a privy place.)
Though we are bereft
Of our Arms, Spits are left,
Whereon the Rump we will roast;
We Will prick it in the Tail
And bast it with a flayl
Till it stink like a Cole-burnt Toast.
It has lain long in brine,
Made by the peoples eyne,
So it is salt though unsavory meat;
We Will draw it round about
With Welsh Parsley, and no doubt
It will choke Pluto's great Dog to eat.
We will not be mocked
This Rump has been dock't,
And if our skill does not fail;
To fear it is good,
Or else all the blood
In the body, lean out at the Tail.
Then down in your Ire
With this Rump to the fire,
Get Harrington's Rota to turn it;
If paper be lack't
The Assessment Act
You may stick upon it least ye burn it.
But see there my Masters
It rises in blisters
And looks very big on the matter;
Like a roasting Pigs ear
It sings, do ye hear
' It Is enough come quickly the Platter.
Lay Trenchers and Cloth
And away bring the broth,
Did the Devil o'th Fag end make none;
But hold by your leave
Napkins we must have
To wipe our mouths when we have done.
Come Ladies pray where?
Will you none of our cheer?
Are ye of such a squeamish nature?
Pray what is your reason,
Are Rumps out of season?
But it is an abuse to the Creature.
Come we will fall on
Pray cut me a bone
The Meat may be healthful and sound;
Fogh! come let us bury't
To th'hole we must carry't
This Rump it stinks above ground.
This fire we will style
The Funeral pile,
The Grave shall be under the Gallows;
The Vane shall be th'scull,
Of some Traiterous Fool,
And the Epitaph shall be as follows.
Underneath these Stones
A Rump-Corporates bones
Are laid full low in a sink,
And we do implore ye
Let them rest, for the more ye
Do stir them, the more they will stink.
THE RUMP END.
