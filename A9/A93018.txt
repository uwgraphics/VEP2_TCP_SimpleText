ON THE MOST NOBLE JAMES, Earl of Annandale.
REader, behold here lies all SCOTLAND's Loss,
A Friend and Lover of the great MONTROS;
SOPHIA's Brother, both in Birth and Fame,
Whose Actions were a Comment on her Name:
Here lies a MVRRAY, whose vast worth shall live
While STORMONT or high ATHOL shall survive:
Who spite of Leagues and Levites durst be good,
And in most crooked times, most upright stood:
It Is ANNANDALE; if any Face dare show
Dry Cheeks, may his own Mourners weep him so.
T. S.
