The VVelchmans Lamentation for the loss of her creat Town, and City of
Hereford.
WHen her was peaten in Teane Forest pi her teadly foe, Sir William Waller, her
was thought tat if her could keep her head and pody together till her got to
Hereford to her hardy cosins and contrymen there, her should pe in creat
safety and security, especially when her was informed her enemy was gone from
her porders, and marched toward Oxford: for ten her was thought never to have
seen her more in her own country, however not pefore her should pe so strong
as to resist her, and save her sweet life from her sword, tat might make a
separation between tat and te pody: put O Hone, her expectation was quite
frustrate, and her was deceived; for when her was think least of her coming,
her heard a strange noise, of Drums and Cuns apout te town, te very voice of te
Cuns put her into a thousand desperations, her could not tell which way to
petake her self, nor how with any courage to run away from her teadly
adversaries so near her: to fight her was not able, for her heart was tead
pefore, even when her first heard of their approach: in this desperate case her
was constrained to call to her a Council of Soldiers, called a Council of
War, which her had had too much on pefore; and indeed could never apide te same
from te time of her nativity; but necessity has no law nor liberty neither in
her country, wherefore nature directed her to save her sweet life pi one means
or other, te beasts will do so; put rather ten her would turn to her foes, her
would die; upon which her resolution after her had congregated her cosins and
contrymen, prethren soldiers, her fell into these ensuing consultations,
and her self peing accounted te wisest in te Senate, her was tesired to teliver
her sense, what her thought best to pe done for te present to save her self
without fighting, if it were possible, and if not, nor no ways for her to run
away, ten to propound upon what contitions her should yield to her enemy, upon
which after much entreaty knowing her self to have been an old soldier at
her house in her own country, put never in any fight till Teane pattell
(where her was pitifully peaten) her was te more willing to perform their
desires, presuming upon her own experience, and terefore her propounded to
their grave considerations tese particulars following: viz.

1 Let her advise her teer cosins and contrymen not to adventure their
persons out of te town, put make te same her safety, and now and ten let
pullets fly out from te houses among her enemies, and if her can make her
provision last till some help and relief may pe sent pi her cosins in Wales,
and so let her enemies waste teir pullets and powter in vain, or with little
disadvantage to her.

2 Let her privately make her friends acquainted with her wants, and need of
help at it is present against her adversaries, pi which tey may send her relief
te sooner, put if her could procure any of te English Forces to come to her
assistance, her doubted not put her should pi fighting make her party cood with
her foes, put her touts her own contrymen will not adventure teir precious
plood in so desperate a combat as must make her enemies leave te town, for tey
pe very fearful to hear te sound often Cuns, and many of tem her scares, will
tie with te conceit tereof, pefore tey can come to her aid.

3 If no assistance come to her in time, ten her sense is, Tat her may
endeavor privately in to night at some secret place of te town, to run away
with her head on her shoulders, and if her can conveniently carry away any of
her prog, to take te same away with her, tat her foes may have no advantage
tereby when tey come into te town, and her would also if her could carry away
with her her coods and arms.

4 If her may not with safety effect any of these things, ten her must pe
constrained to yield up her town upon tese conditions, and terefore her
conceives it necassary to propound to her enemies tese Propositions following,
which being granted, her will be willing to leave te town, and save her life pi
returning into her own country, where if once her has te fortune put to
return, her will see all war and fighting at te Tevill, pefore her will
adventure her self in such toings again, for her perceives her has had no
success in all her enterprises according to her expectation; for her was think
to have cotton creat store of goods, and made her self rich with te spoils of
te English put her was deceived ^rein, (...) conditions for te surrendering up
her town which her would have condescended unto, are tese ensuing, viz.

1 That her may have free liberty to co out of te town with her arms and
ammunition, and pe conducted into her own country with a Passeport for her
honest carriage when her shall be past te fear of her enemies, lest her should
steal from her neighpour any coods, for her hands have been addicted to
teevery, tat her doubts her shall not leave it so long as her live.

2 That her may have liperty to carry with her her pelly timber, as her coose,
pacon, sheese, leek, poultrey, and all her prog to keep her alive and honest in
her journey and march, and carriages allowed her for that purpose.

3 That her maimed cosins and countrymen, and those that are lamed in te
fight, may pe left in te town till tey pe recovered of their health, and able
to travel into their own country.

4 That her with all her fellow Officers may pepardoned and exempted from
future questioning and calling to account for her treas^ cable plots and
actions against her country ^^^d te English people, and her roppery and
pillaging of tem, contrary to te Laws of te Kingdom, and against her own
liperty and freedom, for te which her posterity will curse her in time to
come, when her shall be tead and puried.

If all these things be granted, her will go into her own country, and pe
jocund with her teer wife Shone, and her shildren, which was call tem Shinkin
ap Evan, and Randall ap Morgan, and live hereafter (if her enemies will let her
alone) in peace and quiet, put if her cannot obtain of her soes tese
conditions, ten her must take her fortune as it falls, whether i be to be
hanged, killed, or imprisoned, or made slaves to her adversaries, te very
conceit of either has almost struck her with teath already, then must her take
up her mourning song to the tune of O Hone, and sigh out her life with sorrow,
that her Welsh plood so hot of nature, tat it were able to fire mountains, and
boil te sea like a cauldron in her conceit, and tat her self was slay
multitudes of armed men, should be now confined to te pleasure of her foes, who
if her were put with tem in te field, her could destroy tem with te preath of
her pack parts as soon as pi fighting.

FINIS.
