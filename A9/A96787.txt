What Peace to the wicked? OR, An Expostulatorie Answer TO A Derisorie
Question, Lately made CONCERNING PEACE.

An Expostulatorie Answer to a Derisorie Question lately made concerning PEACE.
ONe, who has, seldom, in his days,
From Fools, or Knaves, had love or praise;
And, who, throughout this Isle, is known,
With cheerfulness, to have bestowne
His Wit, Pains, Person and Estate,
The Publike-Rights to vindicate,
Along imprisonment has had,
For calling of a Spade, a Spade;
Which (if a Court-Card) might have been
Next to the King, except the Queen.
As He, in his confinement lay,
Some asked him, the other day,
When he supposed this War should end,
Or what successes would attend
Our hopes of Peace: which Question, tho
From Levity it seemed to flow,
Or, scoffingly, to be expressed,
Received this Answer, not in jest.
Why ask ye when this War will cease?
Or, when this Kingdom shall have PEACE?
As if you thought, I could fore-shew
What things hereafter would ensue:
Or, as if when the Truth were told,
You value, or believe it could;
Who, nor esteem, nor use have made
Of those Fore-warnings you have had?
They that will know what shall succeed,
Must of Things-past take serious heed;
And, gleane Instructions, whilst they may,
From Actions of the present-Day:
For, past, and present Time declares,
What, for the Future, GOD prepares;
And, till these quicken their fore-sights,
Men sit in darkness, till he smites.
If to this Question, you would know
An Answer, which the Truth shall show,
And, not (with Ahab-like-Desires)
Wish all your Prophets would be liers;
Then, ask your Consciences, and they
Will tell, what things expect you may:
For, let my Troubles never cease,
If ever some have other Peace
Then what their Consciences foresee,
Though KING and PARLIAMENT agree
But, lest the Conscience may be seared;
Or, lest Delusions have appeared,
Which promise Peace, when she is fled,
(And Vengeance hangs over-head)
Ask your own Fears, and humane-Reason*
What they conjecture of the season:
Ask them, what sign it is of Peace,
When wickedness does more increase;
What may be hoped for of that Nation,
That sleights her days of Visitation;
That mendeth not for words, nor blows*
That, in reforming, worser grows;
That suffers them who serve Her best,
To be most wronged, and oppressed;
And, on her Face, all tokens has
Of desolation, and of wrath.
When this is well inquired out,
If still you shall remain in doubt,
What we may seem fore-doom'd unto;
Let me persuade you thus to do.
Get information, when the KING
Intends a Palinode to sing;
When he will their ill-counsells leave,
Who are deceived, and deceive:
What settled peace we can devise,
Whilst Irelands-blood for vengeance cries:
Whilst they, who sought to have begot
A Schism betwixt Us, and the Scot,
Have Trust, or Power: or, else, whilst they
Escape unblam'd, who scandals lay
Upon that Army, by whose hand
GOD, has from Thrall, redeemed this Land;
Both to the grief, and shame, of them,
Who, their beginnings did contemn.
Or, whilst the person of the PRINCE,
(Which traitorously was sent from hence)
Is kept in France, to have some fine
New-foolish-mischievous Design
Raised thereupon; for, who can tell,
But, that, he there so long may dwell,
As, his due birthright to recover,
And, bring his Peasant-Subjects over,
To help persuade with us, that we
Would, here, be slaves, as, there, they be.
Now, if this be the plot, I fear,
It will be long, ere Peace be here.
What Peace can we expect, whilst they
Who spoiled us, not only may
Find mercy, (which we could allow)
But, so imperious, also grow,
As, to reproach us to our Faces,
Even in our priviledged-Places?
Who, once, thought better fruits would come
By that which we have parted from:
But mark the end; and judge what Peace
Will follow, when your friends decrease;
When more Malignants are returned;
When they who love the State, are scorned;
And some, who served it, heretofore,
Are grown as mad, as they are poor.
If, yet, you cannot well discern,
When Peace will back again return,
Get knowledge, with all speed ye may,
What game Malignants have to play;
How far they have, as yet, to run
In that wild Course, too soon begun;
When they are like to call to mind
What lies before them, and behind;
What future-plot it may advance,
To let so many pass to France,
On their bare words, who careless are
Of what they either say, or swear:
What can be hoped-for, of those
Who are, irrationally, Foes:
With safety, what we can propound,
Where, little, save deceit, is found:
Or, what good Harvest can be mowne,
Where, only, mischief has been sown:
And, when these things are truly weighed,
You Will think as much as may be said.
If not; then, next, inquire, how long
Divisions will be raised among
The Lords and Commons; and, when we
Shall find both Houses so agree,
That, to the public detriment,
Nor House, nor Member shall dissent,
Or be united; but, insist
Upon the common-interest;
And, Privilege, nor Custom, strain,
An Innovation to maintain,
VVherby they may invade each other,
Or, separate from one another:
For, you have heard what lot betides
A House, or Kingdom, that divides;
And know, what is likely to succeed,
Till our Peacemakers are agreed.
If, wast, Jerusalem was made,
Who, therein, but three factions, had;
This Island, how may we deplore,
Wherein are three times three, and more!
Some, with the Parliament partake;
Some, for the King a party make,
As he is King: And, some, that, He
A Tyrant might become to be:
Some, would a Popular-estate;
Some, Aristocracie create:
Some, are a faction, for the Pope;
Some, to maintain the Prelates hope;
Some, for the Presbyterians vote;
Some, Independency promote,
Some, strive for this, and some for that,
Some, neither know, nor care for what,
So Wars go on, and get they may
Free Quarter, Plunder, and their Pay.
Some, fight their Liberties to save;
Some, that they others might inslave;
Some, for Religion, and for CHRIST;
Some, that, they may do what they list;
Some, for the Commonwealths avail;
Some, for themselves, with tooth, and nail;
And, they that have the basest end,
As fairly, as the best, pretend;
Not caring, whether their desire
Obtained be, by sword, or fire;
By truth or lies, with love or hate;
By treachery, or fair debate.
This is our posture; and, whilst we
So foolish, false, and factious be,
(Or whilst affairs continue thus)
Who knows what will become of us?
Or, when the man, who these lines penned,
Shall find good usage, or a friend?
Ask those who now of peace do dream,
Who, shall procure the same, for them,
If many are become their foes,
Whom they to be their Champions chose:
If these our substance have bestown,
To make new fortunes, of their own;
If they the public wrongs increase,
To gain themselves a private peace;
If yet, the people doubtings have,
What to refuse, or what to crave;
If they unsettled, yet, abide,
And constant unto neither side;
If, scarcely, they resolved are,
Whether, they would have peace, or war;
Or, whether re-admit they shall
Charles to be King, or none at all;
For, doubtless, if these matters go
As honest men much fear they do,
A wise man needs not break his brain
To search what peace we shall obtain;
Since, whilst thus blind, and mad we be,
What will ensue, a fool may see.
Ask of our Lords, that, were the skreen
Which, anciently, did stand between
The King, and Commons, what th'intaile
Of titles, without power, avail
To such an use; And, how the shade
Of what their Predecessors had
Shall find sufficiency to do,
What, often, the substance reached not to:
And, having weighed what they are now;
What they have been; what they may grow,
And, what we fear, till fixed they are,
As honorably, in their sphere,
As heretofore: Or, till the State
Shall all her spheres anew create,
And place them so, that, neither Orb
Each others motion shall disturb;
Think, what we justly may expect
Those clashings will, at last effect,
Which now obstructive are; and may
Destructive prove, another day;
If some new mischief should begin
Without our circle, or within,
Before the feinds appeased are grown,
Which, we have almost conjured down:
For, by consid'ring things like these,
You may conjecture, if you please,
(Without a new Prognostication)
What will befall this Generation.
Yet, least presumptions may arise
(To fool you with false hopes and lies)
Observe the Commons, if, of them,
None serve two Masters at a time:
Nay, search if none among them be
Who, servants are, this day, to three,
And false to all: Observe, of those
Whom we for publike-service chose,
How many failed the Common-trust;
How vile some are, and how unjust:
How perilous, and hard a task*
It is, those Members to unmaske
That, in affection, are unsound;
How much more hard when they are found
To cut them off: what mean effect
The faithful party must expect
Concerning peace, while such as they
The cunning Ambodexters play;
And what small hope there is of rest,
While we have Cancers in our breast.
Ask them, who sit to take Accounts,
To what their two years pain amounts;
Or, what the Commonwealth it betters,
When they have found who are her debtors;
If, when their guiltiness is known,
And published throughout the town,
A cheating-Sharke may rail at them
Who justly have convicted him;
Yea, be employed as before,
Where he may cheat the State of more;
And be as confident, as tho
He merited by doing so.
Ask, if they have not power to call
As Well the great ones, as the small,
To give account; Those, whom we hear
Cum Privil^gio (as it were)
Have plundered, at an easy rate,
Coin, Jewels, Household Stuff and Plate;
And if you find they have not leave
To question all men who deceive
The Publike-Trust, know, we are yet,
For Peace with Righteousness, unfit.
Then search, if you have eyes to see
Paths, that so blind, so crooked be,
What courses those Committees take
Which, every where, such rumblings make.
Mark seriously, if they appear
Such, as the people say they are;
So false, so proud, so insolent,
So careless whom they discontent;
So scandalous unto the State,
In prosecuting private hate;
So bold, from Equity to vary,
By courses merely Arbitrarie;
And if you find them to be such,
You need not then to question much
What will befall this harrowed Land,
While these Authorized shall stand.
Then, mark what favors now some have
Who sought these Kingdoms to inslave;
How well-befriended, some appear,
Who Neuters were, and worse now are;
How, some exposed be to scorn
Who, of this war, the heat have borne;
What scandalls are of them devised;
How their deserts are under-priz'd:
And, having heedfully surveyed
How good, with evil, is repaid;
Mind well the Doctrine, and the use,
And think, what these things may produce.
Enquire, moreover, how you find
To works of mercy, men inclined;
How, their poor wives and children fare,
Who for their Countre^ slaughtered are;
How, honest causes are preferred;
How speedily your suits are heard;
How Offices conferred be;
And if some have not two, or three,
Who for the public, neither spent,
Nor gave, nor hazzarded, nor lent,
Ought worth regard, whilst they have none,
Who in your service, were undone.
Observe, how equally men share
Those Pensions which allowed are:
How little Best-deservers get;
How many of them, nere a whit;
How conscionably, and, how well,
Rewards, and Punishments, we deal,
Which are the Pillars, whereon stand
The Peace, and Honor of the Land.
Observe, if when we spend a day
In praises, or to fast, and pray,
If preaching tend not more to strife.
Then to sound-Doctrine, or good-life;
If more we seek not to fulfill
Our several humors, and our will,
Then to perform a Thank-oblation,
Or, duties of Humiliation;
Or, if the worship we profess
Be not an outside holiness,
No deeper rooted then the tongue;
Forced fruit, that fades as soon as sprung:
For, as it proves, when you see
These things to trial brought shall be,
You may without much failing, guess,
What likelihoods we have of Peace.
Then, if you be not some of those
Who slight what other men propose,
How probable soere it seem,
(Unless it may advantage them,
Or propagate the private ends,
Of their Confederates, and Friends)
An ear, and eye, pray sometime have ye
Upon our Armies, and the Navy:
An eye, securely to behold;
An care to hear what has been told,
Of some, who much entrusted were
With Arms, and with provisions there;
Or, had Commissions to array,
To furnish, fortify, or pay
Ships, Forts, or men: And, those in chief,
Employed for Irelands first relief,
And our first Armies; Even, when all
Did lie at stake, and seem to call
For faithful, stout, and honest men:
Observe, how they discharged, then,
The trust reposed; how, some were made
Commanders; pay, and titles had;
But scarce a man: how, others, now,
Have used the Commonwealth, and you:
And, if in any, you shall find
Veceit, in this accursed kind,
Forgive them not; yea, when at last
Acts of Oblivion, shall be past
For open foes; no grace provide
For men untrue to their own side,
Least, as our Peace, they have deferred,
They mar it, likewise, afterward:
But, as occasions offered be,
Mind them, although you mind not me:
For, where, in favor, such are found
When peace is made, 'twill not be sound.
Enquire, (if you can tell of whom
To make inquiry) what is become
Of all the public Protestations,
Engaged for private Reparations;
What, of that Vow, which did express
A mutuall-aid, in all distress;
What of the self-denying-Vote,
Which goodly hopes in us begot;
What of those Orders, whereupon
Some trusted, till they were undone;
What of the publike-Faith, in which
We thought our selves exceeding rich,
Though all were lost, so that remained
Inviolated, and unstained:
Inquire (I say) throughout the Land,
In what condition these now stand;
For, when of these you have obtained
That certainty, which may be gained,
It will, undoubtedly, appear
What we may either hope or fear.
Inquire yet further, (least you may
Expect, perhaps, a Sunshine-day,
And meet a storm) in what good mind
That sort of people you shall find
Yeleep'd the Clergy: For, the Stem
Of all our mischiefs was in Them.
Their faction, avarice, and pride,
Did, first of all, this Isle divide.
From them, at first, the Firebrand came
That set this Empire in a flame;
When 'twas nigh quenched again, they blew
Those coals, which did the fires renew,
They did the Nations re-ingage;
The peoples vexed minds inrage,
By fained shows, and false pretenses,
Abusing tender consciences.
The course, by them, at first, begun
Is, to this day, continued on:
And, therefore, take this Truth from me,
For, you shall find it true to be:
That, till you see these more estranged
From what they were; their posture changed;
Yea, till they better their condition;
Confine themselves to their Commission;
Leave off to jangle, fool, and fiddle
With what they should not intermeddle;
And, be as pious, and as wise
As they are outwardly precise;
(And, as those few among them are,
For whose sakes God abates the war)
Nor King, nor Peers, nor Commons neither,
Nor these united altogether,
Shall able be that Peace to make
Which their contentions will not shake
Make one inquiry more, to see,
And search, what most of those men be,
On whose endeavors you depend
To bring your troubles to an end*
Mark, how their Duties they attend
In private, how their time they spend;
What company they most frequent;
What matters give them best content;
What conscience of their debts they make;
What wrongs they do; what bribes they take;
What by their neighbors they were thought
Til they obtained what they sought;
And, to what purpose they employ,
The power, and places, they enjoy.
Then cast an eye upon the Rabble;
And, taking view (if you be able)
Of all together, great and small,
Mark well the Tantamount of all.
Mark, if we be not like an Host
That Is routed when the battell's lost;
And, if we deal not gifts, and blows,
Like madmen, both to friends and foes:
Mark, how those hypocrites, that here
Promoters of the truth appear,
Walk in their masking-suits abroad,
As if they thought, to cozen God,
As they do men* Mark too, that crew,
Which is profane in open view,
How boldly, and how daringly
(Even when Gods thunderbolts do fly)
They do offend; and, whether we
May not to those, compared be,
Who, sawing are those planks asunder,
VVhereon they stand, when Hell is under.
When these inquiries you have made,
To see what light may thence be had;
And when you know, as well as I,
Those hindrances, and reasons, why
That VOICE of Peace, yet goes not on,
Which this time twelve month was begun;
And, shall observe, with due regard,
What has been formerly declared;
I will disclose a great deal more,
Then I have told you heretofore:
But, not till then: yet, least you may
Despair, or faint, before that day;
I will deliver, ere I go,
A comfortable word or two.
There may be PEACE, ere long, though y^^
We nor know how, nor merit it:
For, GOD often shows great mercies, where
The greatest of all sinners are;
And if self-seekers be descri'd,
Before this Isle they more divide;
If Factions, Wrongs, and Discontent
Endanger not this Parliament;
And, if the Faithfull-Members can
But cast out from them now and than
A trouble-house: And, timely swage
The vexed peoples rising rage;
Offer, three more, such peace-oblations
As that was of th'EXAMINATIONS;
And out of Counties, Towns, and Cities,
One Hecatombe of their Committees;
And, by their prudence, work it so,
That honest men esteemed may grow;
That, Priest and People, down may lay
Their works of stubble, and of hay,
Their names, and terms, of SEPARATION*
And meekly seek the preservation
Of TRVTH, in LOVE; if, in one year,
Peace be not firmly settled here;
My loanes, and losses, yet unpaid,
(With my Arrears, three years delayed)
I Will forfeit wholly to the State;
And, live still, as I Have done of late,
By swallowing wrongs, by empty Air,
And, patience, kept, through faith, and prayer,
Thus, to the Question made, you have
That Answer, which our Prisoner gave*
Who, other Tales will tell, if He
Much longer, shall imprisoned be.
A Spaniel beaten, at your foot will lie:
An English-Mastive, at your face will fly.
Take this, and consider of it, till more comes.
