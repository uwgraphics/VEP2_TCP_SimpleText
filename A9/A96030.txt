VOX POPULI: OR THE PEOPLES Humble Discovery, OF Their own LOYALTY, AND His
MAJESTY'S ungrounded JEALOUSY.



LONDON, Printed, Anno 1642.

VOX POPULI.
THE PEOPLES HUMBLE DISCOVERY, Of their own Loyalty, and His Majesty's
ungrounded Jealousy.
ALthough the Charms of Rhetoric have stained your Majesty's Declarations,
Answers, Proclamations, Speeches and Messages, with all the gall, and
opposition, that possibly could be infused to exasperate us into the Nature of
bad Subjects; yet are we resolved to depart from nothing, that may oblige, and
court your Majesty to continue our gracious King.

Your evil Councillors have tempted your Majesty in all they could to divide
your individual Person from your Regal Authority; and we have vowed in the
presence of God, with all the power, and industry we have, to keep them
unseperable: which being inconsistent with the Malignity of that Counsel,
which daily joins it self closer to your Majesty, and divides us, we are
necessitated to employ that power for the separating that malignity from your
Majesty, which else will be the ruin of us all, both King* and People.

That there is Malignity, The strong siding for the Lord Straford, and for the
Votes of Popish Lords in Parliament; The difficult yielding to such good Acts,
as began to establish our Peace, and adventuring to question the same at your
Majesty's return from the North by a Quaere of the freedom of this Parliament;
The many Attempts for dissolving us; The late and slow disarming of the
Papists; The enticing many worthy men of quality to Petition against
established Votes, to the great disturbance and dishonor of both the Houses
and then incensing them to sacrifice the Peace and Liberty (if not the Lives)
of themselves, and the whole Kingdom to their inconsiderate Revenge; and
lastly, the uniting all those into one Army by an Illegal Commission of Array,
do abundantly testify to all men's Consciences (but such, whom passion, and
not malice has carried from us, we hope Wisdom and Religion will restore unto
us) Besides* what Malignity has been wanting in shameful Reproaches,
provoking Scoffs, false Constructions, prejudicate Censures, scandalous
Libells, treacherous Plots, both at home and abroad, in slugging all
proceedings, that tend to the safety of England, or Ireland; in making cheap
the repute of Parliaments; and lastly, both in the invitation and consent of
deserting the Houses to attend and countenance your Majesty's strange distance
from your Parliament, and taking up of Arms against it.

We would not accuse your Majesty, our hearts abhor it; nor will our Laws
suffer it, unless they speak, and proceed to extremities: although your
Majesty endeavor much to be thought the sole Agent: But (as our Laws instruct
us) we accuse such Counselors, and instruments of Regal commands, without
which the Regal Office cannot stand: though we do not instance in all the
particular Authors, the causes of all things being found, but with difficulty:
for such, as dare do ill, will not want so much self-love, as to conceal it,
having the lives and livelihood of them and theirs at stake to bribe their
secrecy; until such time, as they grow bold in wickedness, and discover
themselves, or that He that sees in secret, brings them forth to be rewarded
openly.

And in this loyal care of your sacred person, and tender respect of your
Princely honor, finding that besides the daily discourse of successive dangers
(which seemed to be countenanced by your Majesty) and of unsupportable
Grievances past, and present, both in Church and State, with the slow, and
difficult reparations of either; the People had also strengthened a Jealousy
from the intercourse of Letters between the Pope and your Majesty, then Prince
in Spain, from your preferring the embraces of a Catholic, before a
Protestant, to be the Consort of your Royal bed, and bosom; from the increase
of Papists, Priests, Jesuits, and a Papisticall Clergy, and Ceremonies
throughout the Land: and the general decrease, and several persecutions of
Protestants, and faithful Preachers; from the common boast even of Papists
themselves, that you were of their Religion, and all your Majesty's most secret
Counsels were first known to them: from the sharp and eagre proceedings against
Scottish Protestants, and slow proceedings against Irish Papists, and Rebels:
And lastly, from the earnest Reprieve of Priests or Jesuits at first; and
afterward of 6. Priests and Jesuits; and high Accusation desperately
prosecuted against 6. Members of our Houses of Parliament; that your Majesty
had certainly given up your Faith unto the Sea of Rome. So that being also
inflamed by the Rebellious and prodigious Massacres of Ireland, there remaining
no Oths, nor Execrations sufficient to satisfy jealous people from Princes,
that once give up their Belief unto that Sea, which allows no Oaths, nor
Faith to be kept to such, whom they shall pronounce Heretics, as they do us,
and imposes a Conscientious obedience, secrecy, and assistance to all their
dismal Stratagems: We resolved without publishing the disease (as a sovereigne
Remedy) to settle the Militia, and thereto councelled your Majesty.

But what is Council, if not followed? And what are your Majesty's Acts
without Council? Surely if your Majesty's Acts out of Parliament are guided,
and are not authenticke, but by advice of your Majesty's Attorney, Judges, or
Privy Counselors, and they have power to Declare so; shall the Great Council
of Parliament go less, that gives to all them being, and includes them? Or
shall the Orders of any of their Courts be Legal, and shall not those of the
Parliament be much more?

In this advise therefore, and resolution of the Militia (which your Majesty
used, when there was no need) we yet most humbly and earnestly in this extreme
need and necessity of the Subject persist, until your Majesty remove the just
occasions of fears, and accord to a sufficient cure of Jealousies, by putting
the Peoples safety into the Peoples own hands: whose Jealousies are no whit
abated by your Majesty's absence from Parliament, and raising of contrary
Forces, and sending of several Menaces, and returning to your old Counsels;
and the Papists cheerful interessing themselves in; and rejoicing at all your
proceedings, they all appearing like so many several Omens of the peoples
return to their old Ceremonies* and to their old Grievances, or worse: Nor can
we suffer those who by the Council of the Nation have done faithful service
to the Nation to perish for their faithful service.

The Acts of Sir John Hotham, and the rest employed for the Militia, and for
the Navy, had general commands and instructions to authorize them, and have
had particular approbations to confirm them: they must not suffer, and we
live; nor shall so great a sin make our Nation odious to God and man, if we
can help it. It is not the allegation of a minor part of Parliament can abuse
the wiser, and more Religious sort of your Subjects, since all men know, that
each man's Vote is of equal power, and freedom in Parliament, and the voices
of a few cannot out echo a great many; whatsoever therefore is there
concluded, cannot but by plurality of voices, which truly makes the Parliament,
and the dissenting party makes up the faction, if they persist: or, if it
should so fall out, that the major part (through neglect, or confidence in them
remaining) absent themselves, then are their Votes no less included in the
persons remaining then the Votes of the whole kingdom in the fullness of
Parliament: If any be deterred from this freedom, it argues guilt, or
cowardice, either of which should pronounce such a one unworthy a trust of so
great importance, none being called to the bar, but such, as speak directly
opposite to the published or concluded orders of the House, or wilfully to
move sedition by distrrcting the sense of the House, to the great hindrance and
dangerous delay of more necessary affairs: or else the consciences of men
(convinced with their reasons and propositions) would soon engage the major
part in their behalf, and not against them: which thing likewise may be said
of those multidudes coming with congratulations to confirm such, as freely
discharge their duties; it being the duty of all to speak the sense of the
major part of the people, and such confirmations but the tokens of it; and if
this were not so, we run the greater hazard in your Majesty's displeasure, then
the dissenting party in the disassenting of their equals.

We do avow all our proceedings to be by the Law of God, the integrity of our
own consciences, and the Law of the Land, the interpretation whereof, whether
it be sitting to be delivered up unto your Majesty's Arbitrament, and such as
your Majesty will advance thereunto, or to remain in Parliament (wherein the
liberty and votes of Subjects are preserved) your Majesty may judge, or which
of these your people will consent to.

As for Arbytrarie power (which only is incident to Kings and Princes, who
setting up their will for Law, forsake the benefit of Counsel) it cannot
possibly in any kind be a just aspersion on a Parliament, which is it self a
Council, the greatest Council, and the very proper foundation of all Laws of
the Kingdom.

We do confess in this your Majesty's absence and dissent, we find a want of
that harmony, which should make all our Orders* as well pleasant and
delightful, as good and profitable; and we grieve no less for your Majesty,
who in this remoteness divest your Royal Person of all that glory and
authority, which should accompany your Royal actions.

What should your Majesty pretend any fear, when your undaunted courage left
such a testimony to the contrary, in your passing with so small attendance
through the City, and dined there, even then, when the news of Ireland had
galled the memory afresh of former plots, and the zeal of people stroke into
flame for the dangers of Parliament, and were imbittered with the remembrance
of hardly escaped burdens of Monopolies and ship-monies, Court of Honor,
Starchamber, High Commission, and the Canons? Or what could less partake of
fear, then such a desperate assault of the privileges of Parliament in your
own most Royal Person, with such an uncouth sort of attendants, the very day
before?

And as there was no sign of fear in your Majesty, so was there no cause of
fear from us, or from any your Majesty's Subjects, to whom (had we
entertained the least disaffection or disloyalty) there wanted not opportunity
in any of those times to have endeavored our own ends; but so far were we
from any such attempt (as the malignant persons do falsely belch upon us) that
we not only calmed the minds of people but brought them to undergo those
charges toward the English and Scottish Armies, which those malignant persons
had brought upon your Majesty: Having therefore these great testimonies of love
and loyalty, what can your Majesty fear or suspect? unless you could yet
retain a resolution to consent, or be an actor in some more horrid design*
that could provoke your people beyond all what is past, to forget their
resolutions of affections and allegiance to your Majesty; but sure your Royal
presence will discuss all fears and jealousies, which your continued absence
cannot but foment.

We all have sworn Allegiance to your Sacred Person as King* we did not the
same, when you were Prince, nor is it longer of force unto your Royal father,
that then was King: when your Majesty recedes from your Kingly Office, you are
so far absent from the object of our allegiance; there is no difference of
benefit to him that has eyes, and to him that has none, if light be wanting.
All our oaths depend upon the oath your Majesty has taken; O, then return
unto your Parliament, and so unto your people; Return unto your Parliament,
and so unto your lawful power; Return unto your Parliament, and so unto your
State and Glory; where when your Royal assent has confirmed those necessary
privileges, which may keep whole the consciences and estates of your most
Loyal Subjects, all this our body falls into Atoms* and your Majesty alone
remains in glory, to be beheld the preserver of those privileges, which all
our long and faithful endeavors have consulted with your Majesty.

FINIS.
