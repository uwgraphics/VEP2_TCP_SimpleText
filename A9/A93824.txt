THE STATE OF THE IRISH AFFAIRS, FOR THE Honorable Members OF THE HOUSES of
PARLIAMENT; As they lie represented before them, from the Committee of
Adventurers in London for Lands in Ireland, sitting at Grocers-Hall for that
Service.

LONDON, Printed by G. Miller dwelling in the Blackfriars. 1645.

Reasons delivered by the Committee of Citizens, Adventurers in London for
Lands in Ireland, to the Committee appointed by the Right Honorable the Lord
Major, Aldermen and Common Council of the said City, to be delivered to the
said Court, of their refusal to lend Moneys upon security of the Ordinance of
the 15th of August last, made for raising Moneys for Ireland, to begin in
November next, and to continue for six Months.
THe Adventurers, with their Moneys raised upon their first Propositions, were
to have carried over a Brigade of 500 Horse, and 5000 Foot, into Munster in
Ireland, against those Rebels; which business they were to have carried on by
Officers chosen by themselves, whereby they had the oversight of that
business, and laying out of their own Money, for the best advantage of the
Service.

When they had well nigh raised and armed all their Forces, and made all other
Provisions fit for transportation, both their Money, and Men, and Provisions,
were (upon an unavoidable occasion) made use of by the State here, upon a
sudden and unexpected breaking forth of the distractions here at home, and the
remain of what was not thus employed, or that has come into their Treasuries
since, have likewise been made use of by the State here, wherewith to content
the Irish Officers, who have done very little or no service for all the Money
that they had since.

These distractions increasing, and thereupon when those Lords and Commons that
were appointed by Commission, under the great Seal of England, by direction
both of King and Parliament, to manage the Irish affairs, had withdrawn
themselves from further meddling in the business; and when after that, a
Commit of the Honorable House of Commons, made by order of the third of
September, 1642. for ordering of the Irish affairs, had acted therein so long,
as that they had left no Cash in any Irish Treasury to answer their Orders; and
that a general clamor of the Irish Souldiary was now upon them for pay and
supplies, which they could not remedy; and a hard matter it was, by reason of
the use of Moneys here, to find out a means to give them satisfaction; when
Bristol, Chester, and most of the other parts of the West, were possessed by
the Enemy, whereby all conveniences for sending for Ireland were taken away,
then the Adventurers in London, made more Propositions to raise more Money from
among themselves, without Tax or Assessement of the Subject, to carry on that
War.

That thereupon an Ordinance was made, establishing those new Propositions, and
to secure all such as should adventure any Money thereupon, and erecting and
settling of a new Committee, consisting of some of the Members of the Honorable
House of Commons, and of diverse Aldermen and Merchants of London, Adventurers
for Lands in Ireland, chosen out by the Body of Adventurers to manage the Irish
affairs.

And they were no sooner made a Committee, but the Citizens of the Committee,
are persuaded to advance 10000lb or thereabouts worth of Arms, Ammunition and
victuals, wherewith to furnish 500 Horse, and 5000 Foot, of the British
Regiments in Vlster, upon promise, that they should, being thus furnished,
march out of that Province against the Rebels, into other parts of the Kingdom,
having no enemy near themselves; which Goods were presently provided and
delivered accordingly, yet they never did service therewith, nor at any time
since, that the Committee can understand.

That by the labor and industry of the Citizens of that Committee, they have
procured 30000lb worth of Provisions more to be sent to the Forces there, out
of Holland and the Low Countries, which if they had not received, they had
disbanded and quit the Country to the Enemy, or must have complied in the
Cessation with the Rebels, (which had been as bad) as some of the O^ficers
confessed.

The said Committee of the Citizens also, in this time have sent 5000lb worth
more of Provisions thither, which were bought with the Adventurers Money.

Yet they are now left in debt 5000lb or thereabout, for part of those
Provisions thus advanced, and without means to give those satisfaction to whom
they stand engaged; Which have been thus occasioned.

For that it has been publicly delivered to the Adventurers, at a general
meeting of them, as if the Parliament intend not to perform in that Ordinance
with those that have or should bring in Money for an Adventure upon it; since
which time, very little or nothing has been brought into their Treasury; and
those that had subscribed upon that Ordinance, do refuse to bring in their
Subscriptions.

That the Irish affairs have been since carried on, for a good time together,
by the Commit of the Honorable House of Commons, of the third of September,
1642. and afterward by the Honorable Committee of both Kingdoms, and now by
the Honorable Committee of Lords and Commons for Propositions for Ireland,
which have cooled and withdrawn the zeal and affections of the Adventurers and
others, to bring in any more Money upon the said Ordinance of the 14th of July,
1643. seeing their Committee set aside, and to have no oversight or looking
unto the managing of that business, and the disposal of their Moneys; (that
great sum of 300000lb or thereabouts,) which they have formerly brought in,
having been employed as aforesaid, without adding to them the least hope to
possess their Adventures.

They have been employed since, as a Subcommittee to the Honorable Committee
of both Kingdoms; in which service they have faithfully performed their trust,
and have informed their Lordships of all those miscarriages and failings of the
Officers in the Armies in Ireland, then under the Parliaments power, and
otherwise concerning those affairs; and how the States Treasure have been
wasted and consumed, and nothing done for it; with their opinions of the
remedies to prevent the like misdoings for the time to come, which they having
done in the birth of their employments under their Lordships, have not lately
received more of their commands, (except in raising of Moneys for the Service)
to which they have always contributed to their powers, when they have found
certain ways of reimbursement.

In this time they have offered their endeavors freely, in making provisions
for those Forces, out of the Moneys raised and to be raised upon that Ordinance
of the 16th of October, 1644. if to have been employed in a Committee way upon
account; but the Officers of the Army in Vlster, and one Mr Davis an Irish man,
and some Cheesemongers of this City, joining with them under hand, obtained the
employments, upon Contracts and bargains made, to deliver those Provisions at
certain rates; when the Committee, if to have done the same in a Committee way,
would have advanced the same much sooner, and have saved the State 12000lb, or
15000lb, in 60000lb of the prices allowed Davis; and though they always
declined to do any thing in a way of bargaining, yet when it was pressed of
necessity to be done no other way, they offered the State to do it by
computation, 7000lb or thereabouts, in the said 60000lb, under those rates that
Davis offered; which not being so apprehended, he has been the Man has
carried on all that business before him ever since; but by his leave has
failed in all his undertakings, both for time, manner and matter; for albeit
his agreement was, for to have delivered the Goods by 10000lb the first week,
and 5000lb worth of Goods every week after, till the whole had been delivered,
yet it was four or five months time before he delivered any parcel, and but
very lately that he delivered the last; and has vented such base and
unserviceable Commodities, as they were little worth: besides that, he and his
partners did run no hazard in it at all, for he only assigned the Moneys to
come in, in several Counties to his respective Chapmen, for payment at long
days, who took the same for satisfaction upon their own Adventures, and
reserved a good share and benefit to himself; and then no doubt but they would
also be Gainers by the hand, thus to trust; which must bring poor Commodities
to the Market of necessity, or make his Customers but Savers by the hand; and
this beginning has brought him to be the general undertaker and provider for
whatsoever Goods have gone for the Forces of Ireland since; but in this latter
bargains, he has dealt much more securely for himself, having still fingered
so much Money in hand, upon the matter, as he has acquired the Goods withal,
that if he should never get in the rest, he can be no Loser by the hand, and an
extreme Gainer if to receive all, and has made provision to be satisfied some
other way, if he get it not by this way; besides that, he has taken such ways
for the delivery of the Commodities, and made such provisions for the
Collections of the Moneys, that he will be sure either to have it in before he
shall lay it out, with a 1000lb, and 6d in the pound too for his pains in the
collecting it, or if he fails, another Country is as good to him as this:
besides that, he has hemmed in to be paid out of these Assessements for
Ireland, an old pretended Debt of 12195lb, which is upon matter of Account,
depending before the Committee of Accounts for the Kingdoms, not yet by them
allowed, and which if it shall be satisfied him, is a fortune that he has
raised in little more then Nine months time, by the States employments in
Ireland, there trusting him with 4000lb ready Money to buy the Soldiers
Victuals, having no ability of his own before that time, wherewith to carry on
such an Employment; and the best of his Vouchers will prove Certificates in
gross from the said Colonels and Officers of that Army, for which no doubt but
the common Soldiers have either made many hungry meals, or abated it out of
their Commanders rents, they being most their Tennants; and therefore unwilling
to go further abroad to do service, then they can bewray the smoke of their own
chimnies; and yet such a Stranger as this Davis, is able thus in less then a
years time, to furnish 160000lb worth of Commodities for Ireland, before the
Committee of Adventurers, consisting of One and thirty Aldermen and good
Merchants of this City, who desire to have no such gain from the Common wealth
in such distracted and necessitous times as these.

The Committee of Adventurers at Grocers-Hall (out of their zeal for the
Public, and care for the preservation of that Kingdom, being so nearly
concerned with this, as that the welfare of either is wrapped up together in the
safety and preservation of them both, more then for any benefit they expect by
their Adventures) the 27th of August, 1644. did present several Propositions
to the Honorable House of Commons, for raising Moneys principally from among
themselves, wherewith to maintain those Forces against the Cessation and the
Rebels, and the same day a draught of that Ordinance (passed the 16th of
October, 1644. was also presented to the Honorable House of Commons, by the
Committee of that Honorable House, sitting by Order of the 3d of September,
1642. aforesaid, and both were Committed together: but the Committee of
Grocers-Hall as yet, (by reason of the more weighty affairs of the Kingdom,)
have received no answer concerning them; they have also diverse times since
renewed their humble desires therein, by several Petitions and Remonstrances,
presented both to the Honorable Houses, and the Honorable Committee of both
Kingdoms, for their mediation that something might be done therein, but other
the great affairs of the State, has still prevented the consideration thereof:
they have lately also addressed themselves therein to the Honorable Committee
of Lords and Commons, appointed for receiving of Propositions for Ireland, with
whom they debated the same, and after consultation thereof amongst themselves,
of the results of both Committees, their Lordships transmitted back again unto
them the heads of such of their Propositions, as they thought fit for the
Consideration of the Houses, desiring that the body of Adventurers might be
called together, to advise with the Committee thereupon, and to certify them
what Moneys they would advance, and what other encouragements they would give,
to move the Houses to incline to pass them: and thereupon the Adventurers did
meet accordingly, and upon debate thereof amongst themselves, did return the
same back again to the said Honorable Committee of Lords and Commons for
Propositions for Ireland, with some small alterations; and withal did return
unto their Lordships the humble Petition of the Committee and Body of the most
principal Adventurers of the City, signed with many of their hands; offering
upon the credit of such an Ordinance to pass presently, to have advanced
20000lb in Money, and such Provisions as should be ordered to be sent for
relief of those Forces, and that they did not doubt but thereby to make all
further supplies for carrying on that War in Munster, and that those Forces
being well supplied and maintained (under God) might be a great and ready
means, quickly to reduce all that Kingdom under the power of the Parliament;
and praying their Lordships to recommend that their Petition, with the said
Propositions to the Honorable Houses to be considered accordingly; but all
this notwithstanding, the Adventurers cannot understand that the same have been
delivered to the Houses accordingly.

But now since the Right Honorable the Lord Major, have heretofore been
desired to summon a meeting of all the Adventurers, and that it might be
propounded unto them to lend 15000lb, or more Money upon the Credit of this
other Ordinance lately passed, for raising Moneys for Ireland, by another
Assessement for six Months more, to begin in November next; at which meeting
some of that Honorable Committee were present, and upon debate thereof it was
not thought fit to be done; and indeed both the Committee and Body of
Adventurers having formerly been treated with to that purpose, both before and
since the passing of that Ordinance, did give their opinions, that if it should
pass, as things then stood, and yet do stand, it could hardly be expected that
Moneys would be advanced upon it, for diverse reasons then given; and since the
passing it, Commissioners of the Citizens are named, without the privity of the
Adventurers, to go for Munster in Ireland to act for the City there, which
never had, nor has any particular engagement in that part of the Kingdom, the
Adventurers hoping they shall have their own Choice, of such as they shall
employ there, concerning their Adventures.

And the Reasons that moved the Committee of Grocers-Hall heretofore, and yet
does, to refuse the lending of any Money, upon this Ordinance of the 15th of
August, 1645. were, and are these following. viz.

First, The said Ordinance does revive a former Ordinance of the 18th of
October, 1644. and the Committee have never yet seen or understood of any such
Ordinance made, but of an Ordinance made the 16th of October, 1644. to which
this Ordinance has no relation; and if there be no such Ordinance of the 18th
of October, 1644. then this Ordinance of the 15th of August, 1645. has lost
its effect, and cannot revive that which never had a being.

Secondly, To revive an Ordinance to have continuance for a longer time, after
its expiration, without more words to express the intent and power thereof, to
make new Levies, etc. may admit of a dispute, what is meant by this word
(Reviving) standing thus alone, and may well be construed only to intend the
Levying of such Moneys thereupon, as have not been collected within the time of
its being and continuance, and in such a Case is no foundation of Credit, to
engage for borrowing of Money.

Thirdly, Admitting these exceptions were out of doors, (yet then there is a
proviso, that all Arrearages which shall be due and unlevied for the Weekly
assessements upon the said Ordinance of the 18th of October, 1644. (if any such
be) for the time of Continuance first limited therein, the same shall be
leavied, brought in and paid to the Treasurers according to the Ordinance, and
that the same shall be disposed and issued out for the discharge of the Orders
and Contracts made with the Houses of Parliament, or the Committee of the two
Kingdoms, in pursuance of the said Ordinance; which shows, that the word,
Reviving, in the Ordinance of the 15th of August, 1645. is meant of Leavying
what is behind and unpaid of that Ordinance at the time of its expiration, and
mentions nothing of any new Leavy or Assessement to be made, and so is
conceived no such security to borrow Money upon as is propounded.

Fourthly, The Ordinance of the 16th of October, 1644. made for an Assessement
through the Kingdom of England, and Dominion of Wales, for the present Relief of
the British Armies in Ireland, should raise above 200000lb in all places; and
that there is 80000lb charged upon it, first for relieving the British
Regiments in Vlster; and Mr John Davis has obtained another reviving Ordinance
of it, of the 27th of September, 1645. to satisfy him the sum of 36945lb
more, so it is charged with 116945lb in all; of this, 50000lb is only yet come
into the Treasury, that there is 66945lb yet to be leavied, and this must be
leavied the first; and who will lend Money, to expect it after the leavying and
payment of such a Sum, and to put it to a hazard; whenas a man may lend out
his Money, and have 8lb per cent. for it, to be repaid in his own time, and to
have as good security as the Kingdom can afford?

Fifthly, If only 50000lb of 200000lb have been brought in, in a years time,
and at the first beginning, when men were better able and disposed to the
work, and this done by the earnest and continual solicitation of Mr Davis,
and of his Emissaries and Creditours that are so concerned in it, and have
acted it to the life; what can be conceived must follow of these Assessements
in the later end of the day, when men are more and more exhausted in their
estates, and who now do fall short to satisfy those Assessements (in as great
a proportion) of maintenance of General Fairfax Army, and of the Scots Army in
England, which are for their immediate and more necessary preservation, and the
subduing of an Enemy here at home?

Sixthly, The people begin generally to understand the ill carriage of Mr Davis,
and his fellow Cheesmongers in this business, and that they hunt after these
bargains, to raise themselves fortunes this way, and care not how they deceive
the Common wealth, so they may enrich themselves, and put the Money into their
own purses; which not only makes the people unwilling, but many of them wilful
to refuse the payment of these Moneys, which many of them do apprehend thus may
be cast away; and are not a little troubled, to see the Citizens of London, men
of worth and integrity, unimployed in the service; and such a poor fellow as
Davis, and a mere stranger, vaulting himself herein against the whole City. For
these Reasons, the Committee of Adventurers at Grocers-Hall, as heretofore, so
do now again desire to be excused for lending of any Moneys upon the Terms
propounded, which they desire may be delivered to the Right Honorable the Lord
Major, Aldermen and Common Council, as their sense and answer to their demands.

And now albeit they are not desirous to draw employment, and the burden of
more business upon themselves, yet for the good and benefit of the
Commonwealth, and the better safety and preservation of the Kingdom of
Ireland, so nearly concerned with this; if the Houses of Parliament might be
moved yet to consider of their Propositions, and to pass them into an
Ordinance, in such way as they shall think fit, that so a ground and sure
foundation may be laid, not only to relieve those Forces in Munster for the
present, but to maintain and carry on that War there. Upon the Credit of such
an Ordinance, they shall yet be willing to advance the 20000lb so formerly
undertaken, and carefully to provide for continual supplies to be made for the
future; and will freely bestow their greatest care and industry, to husband
things for the best benefit and advantage of the Service, without expectation
of benefit or reward; and doubt not but in such case (under God) to render the
Parliament a good Account of that Province in a short time; which is especially
considerable (as the State of the affairs of that Kingdom now stands at
present) that it be secured of all the rest, both against the Rebels within it
self, and the Enemy that may invade it suddenly from abroad.

They have likewise hereunto annexed the Copies of those heads of their said
Propositions and of their Petition, the Originals remaining with the said
Committee of Lords and Commons, which were, as they conceive, once heretofore
agreed upon by the said Commit and body of Adventurers, to have been
presented to the Honorable Houses of Parliament for their consideration: and
it is the humble suit of this Committee, that the Right Honorable the Lord
Major, Aldermen and Common Council, would yet be pleased, if they shall so
think fit, to interpose their mediation to the Honorable Houses of
Parliament, that the same may be considered accordingly, and in such way as
they shall think fit.

The heads of an Ordinance to be prepared for the supply of the Forces in
Munster, with the Amendments.

Secondly, To require the payment of such Moneys as have been underwritten
formerly, and not paid in.

Thirdly, That where the Subscribers themselves cannot pay in their Moneys
subscribed for a fourth more; that in every such case, any other of the

same, together with such Lands as lie adjacent and contiguous to the said City
and Towns respectively; for which houses and Lands, the purchasers shall pay
four years purchase, to be sold and disposed by Commissioners indifferently to
be appointed by the Parliament, whose rule shall be (in reference to the said
four years purchase) as the said houses and Lands respectively were worth in
Anno 1640. or three years before; and that such as shall adventure herein,

possession, but shall have their former adventures also set out unto them in
that Province of Munster by the said Commissioners, presently as the Lands
shall be conquered from the Rebels.

Fifthly, That there shall be provision to pay such Debts of the said Committee,

ready to give an account to the Houses of Parliament, of their doings from time
to time, when they shall be thereunto required.

Twelfthly, That an Ordinance may pass, that such as are able and have
plentiful estates, and have done nothing, or very little to assist the
Parliament and Common wealth, but have obscured themselves from bearing the
common burdens of the Kingdom all this while; that power may be given to the
said Committee, fairly to treat with them to subscribe something with the
willing party, and contribute herein; which if they shall obstinately and
wilfully refuse to do, that in such case they may be compelled to subscribe
some reasonable sum, answerable to their estates, to help to do the work
withal, as others, and to have the same benefit as others.

TO THE Honorable House of Commons in this present Parliament assembled, The
Humble Petition of the Committee and Body of Adventurers in London for Lands in
Ireland sitting at Grocers-Hall.
Showing,
THat ever since the Parliament, by their Ordinance of the 14th of July, 1643.
was pleased to make them a Committee to act in the Irish affairs, they have
employed the utmost of their endeavors to serve the Commonwealth in that
business, and are ready to give an Account of their Actions therein, which
they are well assured, upon examination, will render them free and clear from
all neglect of duty and service in whatsoever they have been trusted.

But it has been their unhappiness in this time, for want of further power
and trust, that they have not been so serviceable as they desired, and as
otherwise they could have been.

And many months since, they humbly presented to this Honorable Assembly
their Petition, together with certain Propositions for raising Moneys for the
better carrying on of that War, and whereof several times since they have
been, by their other Remonstrances and supplications, besought the
consideration, which by the interposition of more weighty affairs have till
this time ^ven by.

And now lately they have again addressed themselves herein unto the Honorable
Committee of Lord and Commons, for receiving and preparing of Propositions for
the Honorable Houses for this Service, and who upon the debate hereof have
been pleased to approve of so much thereof, as your Petitioners do humbly
conceive they have already, or do shortly intend to present to this Honorable
Assembly to be considered.

Your Petitioners do apprehend the Province of Munster in that Realm, and
consequently that Kingdom, is now at present in great danger to be lost,
without timely supplies, and provisions to be made for to maintain those Forces
for the future.

And they further crave leave, humbly to present their sense and opinions of
this present affair (always with submission to your graver judgments) that if
these Propositions shall be thought fit to be framed into an Ordinance, to
pass both the Honorable Houses of Parliament; then your Petitioners, upon the
credit thereof, will advance 20000lb in Money, and Provisions for the Service,
and in such reasonable time as the exegencie of the occasion, and this
Honorable House shall r^quire the same.

And are confident from time to time, to make all such further supplies for
maintenance of the Forces there in that Province, by this means, as will not
only render the same wholly under your power, but probably (under God) may be a
great occasion to reduce those Rebels to their obedience, and subject all that
Realm under the Parliaments command.

All the Adventurers also, and others with them alike concerned in that
Kingdom, will thus undoubtedly be abundantly satisfied and encouraged, with
ch^erfullnesse to contribute and lay out themselves yet more in this affair;
and the Parliament will be freed from much trouble and care otherwise for to
make provisions for that service for the future and time to come.

The lives of many thousands of poor Protestants, our friends and brethren,
will thus be there preserved, and this Kingdom delivered from a bloodthirsty
Enemy, which otherwise will daily infest us here at home, both by sea and land.

The honor of this Nation will be thus still preserved, in maintaining our
interests there, which our Ancestors heretofore have purchased, and for many
hundreds of years maintained, with the expense of much Treasure and blood.

The Parliament and its party will be hereby exceedingly strengthened, and
their Adversaries extremely weakened, both in their present hopes, power and
assistance, both there and from abroad.

The Protestant party thorowout Christendom, will the rather also be
encouraged to join with us in this great work of Reformation, and a fruitful
and good Land will thus again ere long be repeopled, to live under the Sunshine
of the Gospel, where otherwise Popery and superstition will be planted, to the
great dishonor of Almighty God, and the great discomfort of the Nation to
succeeding generations.

Your Petitioners will thus also save very much to the State, both in the
prices and goodnesses of such provisions as shall be necessarily sent for that
Service, and will do the same in time as readily, and much more satisfactorily
to the people, then any particular men shall possibly be able to undertake and
do; All which they humbly pray this Honorable Assembly to consider accordingly.

And they shall pray, etc.
December. 11. 1645. At the Committee appointed to consider of the Reasons for
not lending Money for Ireland.
ORdered that Richard Deacon Clerk to the Committee of Grocers-Hall, do bring
or send to morrow at two of the Clock in the afternoon, to this Committee
sitting in the Queens Court, all the Books and Papers remaining in his custody
concerning the Irish affairs, since the 19th of June, 1643.

Franc. Thorpe.

To the Worshipful Fr. Thorpe, Esquire, sitting in the Chair of the Committee
of the Honorable House of Commons, appointed to consider of the Reasons for
not lending Money for Ireland, these present.
SIR,
WE have seen your Order of the 11th of this instant December, requiring our
Clerk M r Richard Deacon, to bring or send all the Books and Papers remaining
in his custody, concerning the Irish affairs, since the Nineteenth of June, One
thousand six hundred Forty and three: And being ready to submit to the
Honorable House of Commons in all their commands, it has caused us to look
into their Order of the Eighth of this instant, whereby you are made a
Committee, and wherain we find not any thing mentioned to that purpose; nor do
we conceive how our Books and writings should make any discoveries of those
matters within your direction; but if we shall understand from you wherein they
or we may serve you and the public, we shall be ready to attend with
whatsoever shall conduce to the service; praying you to be informed, that all
these which you desire from us, do now lie under Command of the Committee of
Accounts of the Kingdoms, as our vouchers, to justify us and our Accounts,
delivered in before them, for the receipts and disbursements of such Moneys, as
have come into our Treasury, and are those things, by which we must answer our
proceedings, in whatsoever we have been trusted; and therefore we hope, you
will not conceive it reasonable, that we should denude our selves thereof,
having daily use of them also, about matters and Questions in things which we
have transacted, and do frequently use them at our public meetings, and
without which we cannot discharge our duties, nor that Service committed to us.

Nor do we further apprehend our selves concerned in the matters of your
inquiry, unless you shall think fit to enjoin us to a new debate of the
Propositions before you, formerly agreed upon between the Honorable Committee
of Lords and Commons for Propositions, and us and the Body of Adventurers for
raising Moneys to carry on the War in Munster in Ireland; which, with
submission to your better judgments, we humbly do conceive already fully
digested, and made fit for the Resolution of the Houses, and which we do humbly
pray you would be pleased to move for that purpose, we being no ways able to
add or alter any thing, in, or to them, being still ready to obey the
Parliaments pleasure, in whatsoever they shall determine upon them.

And for what is contained in the Reasons mentioned in your Order, was
delivered by us only to the Lord Major, Aldermen and Common Council of the
City of London, as our sense then; and why we refused to lend the 15000lb
desired upon credit of the Ordinance of the 15th of August last; against which
we object nothing, but what arises merely out of the frame and construction of
the Ordinance it self: and upon the Ordinance of the 16th of October, 1644.
made for raising 80000lb for relief of the British Forces in Ireland, to which
that other Ordinance of the 15th of August does relate: and the Ordinance of
the 27th of September, 1645. which Ordinances if you shall be pleased for to
peruse with the Reasons, is all that we can say as to that particular; and
whether substantial or not, are no more but our apprehensions why we desire to
be excused in lending the Money.

And for so much in those Reasons as does concern M r Davis and his Partners,
their failings, deceits and frauds used in the matters of their contracts made
with the State, which is all we intended more in those Reasons; it is all
matter of Account, and examinable by the Committee of the Accounts of the
Kingdom, and now depending before them, from whom no doubt but you may be fully
satisfied in all things that concerns that business; which their Certificate
and Examinations delivered in to the Honorable House of Commons, and mentioned
in your Order concerning him directly pointed at* the contracts, orders and
proceedings of all which business concerning M r Davis and his partners, are
remaining recorded with M r Fr^st Secretary to the Honorable Committee of both
Kingdoms, and not with us; from whom also you may at pleasure receive all
satisfaction in them that you can desire.

And more then in these things we understand not at present, whereof you desire
to be satisfied; and for which we crave your pardon, if we have been too long
in the relation, and to assure you there is nothing in which we will be wanting
to serve you and the public.

Signed in the Name, and by Order of the Committee for Irish affairs at
Grocers-Hall, by D A. WATKINS.
Grocers-Hall, 16th December. 1645.
TO THE Honorable House of Commons in this present Parliament assembled, The
Humble Petition of the Committee of Adventurers in London for Lands in Ireland,
sitting at Grocers-Hall.
Showing,
THat your Petitioners are informed, that the Right Honorable the Lord Major,
Aldermen and Commons of the City of London in Common Council assembled, have
presented to this Honorable Assembly, certain Reasons given in by your
Petitioners to that Honorable Court (upon conference with a Committee of them
appointed to ^eat with your Petitioners) why they could not lend the 15000lb
desired upon security of the Ordinance of the 15th of August, 1645. for raising
Moneys for the r^lief of Ireland* together with certain Propositions agreed
upon by the Honorable Committee of Lords and Commons for Propositions for
Ireland, and your Petitioners, and the Body of Adventurers, to be presented to
the Parliament, of diverse ways prescribed for raising Moneys (...) that
Service.

Wherein your Petitioners only intend two things, the raising Moneys to ^^rry
on that War for the future, by the Propositions, and the discovery of
s^v^^all gross failings, frauds and deceipts, by Mr John Davis and his
Part^^^^ in making Provisions for Ireland, wherein your Petiti^^^^^ aim at
(...) but the good of the S^^te, and that the Parliament may be truly in^^^^ed
thereof.

And therefore they humbly pray, that this Honorable Assembly, will in the
first place be pleased, to take the said Propositions into consideration, and
debating them, resolve upon them, what in your grave judgments you shall
think fit; which having been debated and agreed upon by the Committees and
body of Adventurers aforesaid, do humbly conceive, they want only your
Resolutions upon them: And they are humble suitors yet further, that some
Commissioners from this Honorable House, and of such others as you shall
think fit, may be presently sent for the Provinces of Munster and Vlster, to
order things there upon the place; and that howsoever some course may be
presently prescribed for raising Moneys to carry on that War this next
Summer; which they the rather importune, for that they are certified from one
of your Commissioners, at this time in the Province of Vlster, that if 40000lb,
the most in Money, the rest in Ammunition and Artillery, may be sent them
before March next, an Army of 10000 Horse and Foot will be ready to take the
field there by that time, and (under God) shall be able to give a good account
of all that part of the Kingdom, before the next Summer ended; and to use his
own phrase (make it as safe living in those parts, as in any the Associated
Counties of England) pressing for Money principally in this Case, for that
therewith they can buy as much Victuals for 6s 8d, or 7s, as the Parliament now
gives Mr Davis 16s; and Cloth for 8s the yard, which is furnished to the
Officers at 18s per yard, and so in other things.

And forasmuch as all that your Petitioners have alleged against Mr Davis and
his Partners, is matter of Account, breach of Undertaking, and fraud and
practice in deceiving the State, in those things which have been committed to
their trust, and all which lies in examination before the Committee of Accounts
of the Kingdoms, and do consist in many particulars; that therefore you will be
pleased, for that part thereof also, to require the said Committee of Accounts,
speedily to examine and certify the same to this Honorable Assembly.

And forasmuch as the said Mr Davis and his Partners, have already received
above 40000lb of the Moneys ordered them for their satisfaction, which is a
very competent Sum, to this time for what they have delivered; that you will
therefore give order to the Treasurers of Grocers-Hall, if you shall so think
fit, that they do hereafter reserve such Moneys in their hands, as shall come
in upon those Ordinances, out of which they should be satisfied what is
behind, until these matters shall be fully heard and determined, that so the
Parliament may have in deposito wherewith to be recompensed for these
miscarriages and losses, when they shall appear, and which will be a mean in
such case, to draw the same to a speedy end.

And forasmuch as Sr John Clotworthy, Knight, one of the Members of this
Honorable Assembly, has received 24000lb or thereabouts, of the States and
adventurers Money, and is much doubted that he can give no good account
thereof; and which matter also, as your Petitioners have heard, do lie before
the said Committee of Accounts examined: Therefore for the just repair and
vindication of the Gentleman, and for satisfaction of your Petitioners, and of
all the world, how he has disposed of the Moneys, Goods and Provisions he has
received for the Forces in Ireland.

They also humbly pray, that this Honorable House would be likewise pleased,
to require the said Committee of Accounts of the Kingdoms, to certify this
Honorable Assembly the true state of his account, and whatsoever matters and
things lies before them dependent thereupon, that so you may proceed to do
therein also as in your grave wisdoms you shall think fit:

And they shall pray, etc.
Da. Watkins, by order of the Committee.

Reasons delivered by the Adventurers in London for Lands in Ireland, for to
maintain the Equity of their Propositions, Presented to the Honorable Houses
of PARLIAMENT, for the better carrying on the War in Ireland.
THey did propound them, almost two years since, in more perilous times, when
that Kingdom was even gasping for life, and in Cessation with the Rebels, all
the parts of it but Vlster; and when this Kingdom was in a very sad and
calamitous condition, in great danger to have been destroyed by a potent enemy,
and with much labor working out supplies for the support of it self at home,
and which they have pursued ever since, with many more then twenty Petitions
and Remonstrances to the Parliament and their Committees, to have gained
consideration, which the great affairs of this Kingdom has still prevented,
till this time; the said Committee of Grocers-Hall having procured much relief
in the interim to the Soldiers in Vlster, which has kept them together, and
since to the Soldiers in Munster, that they have declared themselves for the
Parliament; or otherwise they have confessed, that whole Kingdom was in great
danger to have been yielded up and lost; which proves the reality of the
Committees affections, and that their labors have not been fruitless, nor to
have been biased to any other ends, then the mere good of the Kingdoms.

There is not any of the said Propositions, which does generally charge the
people by Tax or Assessement, but are all in effect arbitrary and of
benevolence, a matter considerable, to ease the Subject what possible may be in
these times, when their estates are so much weakened and exhaust, as that they
are very hardly able to pay such Taxes and Contributions as are charged upon
them, merely necessary for to support the burdens of the Commonwealth at
home, saving that one only Proposition which is desired to compel the ill
affected, that have obscured and estranged themselves all this while from
assisting the Parliament and this Cause, with their purses and persons, having
done very little, or not in proportion to their estates as others, and whose
greatest injury in this constraint, will be but to compel them unto an act for
their own advantage; and that they now join with the good party, to carry on
the War there, in a time more nearer to the benefit to be received for their
disbursements, and wherein they shall, with more visible hopes, partake of that
which has been all this time preserved to such a day of good expectation, by
those that have made conscience to save their Country from ruin, with the
expense and hazard of their lives and fortunes.

They are all Propositions tending to the maintenance of that War, the more
speedy reducing of those Rebels to their obedience, the reestablishment of that
Government once again in peace and quiet, and the better peopling and
civilizing of that Realm, for which all should possibly contend, and lay down
those ways and means that have the greatest likelihood and appearance to effect
a good and speedy plantation of that Kingdom, with a religious people, in the
place and stead of that Idolatrous Nation the Irish Rebels.

For which purpose, if there may be raised a considerable revenue to the Crown,
to support its own burden, though with some assistance and help from hence
now in the beginning; if such ways and courses may be taken, as may the
soonest bring all the three Kingdoms, all to be as one Nation and people, and
may the speediest secure it from danger of an enemy, is without all
peradventure of the greatest consideration.

Which to effect and bring to pass, is by engaging all the three Kingdoms
together by all possible ways and means, and all the Protestant party in
Christendom in one common bond and union, that will submit to our form of
government in Church, and the Civil State; and if the Parliament should give
those Lands freely to men thus qualified and undertaking (always reserving
such a good revenue to the Crown thereout, as aforesaid) must questionless do
this with the most speed and security.

How can it be then reasonably objected, against those that have and shall not
only adventure considerable sums of Money, to carry o^ the Wa^^e there at
present, but agree to secure great rents unto the Crown for their Lands for the
future, to have whatsoever proportions of the Rebels estate^, they shall upon
such terms acquire and undertake to plant?

Upon which grounds, will it not be very advantageous to the Commonwealth, if
to condescend to all such Propositions as shall thus do this wor^e: As first,
that the Adventurer, that brings in ready Money, have the priority to be
satisfied; next, that the Soldier may be allowed all, or part of hi^ pay, and
entertainment out of these Rebels Lands at least; and next, those P^^testants
of other Nations, that will Adventure and set down with us upon these
conditions, that those poor Protestants of Ireland, who have been dispoiled of
their estates there by the Rebels, and many thousands (...) their lives, their
heirs and assigns have not only restitution of what have been thus forcibly
taken from them, but satisfaction for such damages also as they have sustained,
out of the estates of those Rebels by whom they have thus suffered, which would
cause thousands to return, that otherwise will not; and if those Merchants of
London and elsewhere, that have lost their debts by the Rebellion there,
paying some Money more at present, may have a share also of the Rebels Lands
for all: And if those Counties, Cities and Towns Corporate, which shall pay any
Moneys toward the support of this War, hereafter may have proportions of
Lands also assigned unto them for the whole Moneys they shall disburse, the
revenew thereof to be for maintenance of their common Charges, would not this,
in all likelihood, suddenly plant the place, and make it become a flourishing
Commonwealth?

Besides that, by these means that Kingdom will be thus furnished with
Freeholders for to put the Laws in execution, and for bringing of those Rebels
unto condign punishment, of which otherwise there will for a long time be a
great want to carry on the Legal affairs of that Commonwealth; it may thus
also be so ordered, that Thousands of the poor Natives of that Land, may be
soon brought to conformity in Religion and manners with us, and all their youth
be transplanted hither from time to time, and here b^ed up and educated in good
Nurture, and others exchanged and sent from (...) in their rooms and steads to
inhabit there, and all maintained by the (...) and profits of those Lands; and
thus in a short time, make that place to be as civil and fruitful every way
as this our mother Kingdom.

And he that does well understand that government, ^^st confess, that the
planting of that place heretofore by little and little, (...) of that
Commonwealth, for (...) they thus (...) together with the Idolatrous
Inhabitants of the Land, and by making marriages, and otherwise joining with
them, many of them have been suddenly perverted in their Religion, and scarce
one of a Family has continued Protestants to a second Generation; and then it
has been observed, that such Proselytes once made, have proved the most
despitefull and pernicious of all the rest to a general reformation.

The Governors also of that Realm, for the most part heretofore, having so
great power put into their hands, have been so lifted and puffed up with the
conceit and opinion of their greatness, that they have commonly forgotten
their errand, and for what end they were placed there; and have been misled to
all injustice and oppression of the people, to make themselves and their
followers rich and honorable, out of the ruins and destruction of the
subject, and therefore the government have been observed to be more prosperous
and happy, when it has been by more Justices, then by any one Deputy, or Lord
Lieutenant of the Kingdom.

They have therefore humbly offered their sense and apprehension, that the
Government there in the Parliaments power, be now rather ordered by
Commissioners in the Provinces upon the place, then by any Lord Lieutenant or
Deputy, not only for the Reasons aforesaid, but in respect also, that the
Metropolitan City of Dublin, the usual place of Residence and abode of all the
Chief Governors of that Kingdom heretofore, is not at present under the
Parliaments power, where the Supreme Courts of Law and equity of that Realm are
usually kept, and where all the Parliaments Rolls and other Records of that
Kingdom are remaining and upon Record, by which that whole government have been
ever ordered and carried on, and without which it is not possible for any Lord
Lieutenant, Deputy or Chief Governor for to ex^rcise that authority in its
fulness, and with such prosperous success and effect as is heartily desired,
nor so to manage such a power, as that he can equally and with justice,
determine and decide such controversies and debates, as will assuredly arise in
judgment before him there, for want of such Records, and whereof if the Rebels
should by any stratagem or strength of arms become Musters and possessed, no
doubt but whatsoever thereof does make against them, would quickly be cancelled
and defaced, and of what dangerous consequence that must inevitably prove unto
this Crown and State, may be easily understood; and therefore whiles there is
hopes for to reduce or bring the same again under the Parliaments power, all
ways and means would be used to make that place secure the first; besides that
it stands situate for correspondence with England and the other parts of that
Kingdom, the most convenient, and between the other Provinces, that no Deputy
or these Governors, to be sent into any other Province now in obedience to the
Parliament, can possibly hold such intelligence, and keep such compliance with
the other parts of that Realm, as is necessary to carry on such a government;
besides that, so great a Minister of State must be maintained in a port and
degree like that which he represents, or it will subject his person and
authority unto contempt; and if it shall come short of that Eminency accustomed
to those that have swayed the Government before, it may be observed with
disadvantage and much detriment to the proceedings every way. Nor is it
40000lb, as it is humbly conceived, will furnish one out to such an undertaking;
which Money to be employed for payment of the Soldier, will furnish 10000
Horse, and Foot into the Field there this next Summer, from out of the Province
of Vlster, as is certified by the Commissioners from thence, with great
expectation to reduce and settle all that part of the Kingdom in quiet: besides
that, it is apprehended, that the Military Government in the Province of Vlster
there, is by the Parliament already settled under the Command of his Excellency
the Earl of Leven, where the Soldiers and Inhabitants are the most of them his
Country men, and will undoubtedly be more ready and willing to fight under a
General of their own Nation; and little else there is there to do for Civil
affairs, which the Commissioners already sent, and more that may be sent from
hence by the Parliament, may not easily perform, and save all this vast charge
of a Deputy into the bargain: And for Munster, the Lord Inchiquin being made
Lord President of that Province by the Parliament already, in whose power both
the Martial and Civil Government being placed there, and he being a man, of
whose fidelity the Parliament have had such an approved assurance, if he shall
have some Commissioners also joined with him, and sent thither for carrying on
the War there, will be abundantly sufficient to answer whatsoever can be
expected for managing the affairs in that Province, which of all other is a
place the most considerable, and with all possible speed for to be supplied, as
not only being the best part of that Kingdom, and most advantageous for this
every way, but is more open and liable to the invasion of a foreign Enemy, and
which will be the first part they will undoubtedly attempt; and those supplies
which the Pope has lately sent unto them of Money, Arms and Ammunition, with
many other things of like consideration, do clearly manifest a confederation of
the Romish Catholic party thorowout Christendom to assist those Rebels,
against which therefore now timely provision would be made while it is to day.

And as these were some motives in the general, that induced the Adventurers
to disburse their Moneys for that service, and so earnestly for to contend for
the safety and preservation of that Kingdom, so for the particular of their
Propositions, they were carried on to propose them for some other reasons also
inducing them thereunto; as,

In the first place, to have a Confirmation of the Ordinance of the 14th of
July, 1643. for such cause as in their reasons herein aforesaid is mentioned.

And do humbly propose the second, as a thing of greatest equity, that those
who have underwritten, and not paid in their Money, should bring it in as
others, to help to carry on the War, and is but to turn that into an
Ordinance for this purpose, which the Houses of Parliament heretofore, after
many debates, agreed to be just, and drew up into an Act of Parliament, and
sent unto his Majesty for his Royal assent, which he refusing, have not
therefore taken away the justness of the Law.

And do propose the third, as beneficial to the Service, and in no sort
prejudicial unto any; for as it shall not lose the first Subscriber any thing,
so it will bring in more Money and more Adventurers, both to help to carry on
the work, and to plant the Kingdom, when the War is done; and the more that
are engaged in the undertaking, must of necessity be most advantageous to the
cause in general.

And do propose the fourth, as a great expedient in this affair, to reduce
those Rebels to their obedience the sooner, for now to grant the Rebels Lands
and Estates in these Cities and Towns mentioned in the Proposition, upon
condition to be presently planted, will not only bring in a good people to
dwell amongst them, and Moneys to help to maintain the War; but will
exceedingly strengthen the proceeding, and encourage the Soldier to have his
Country men, and those of his own Religion, in whom he may confide and trust
thus about him, and to whom he may retire for comfort and refreshment, when he
is wearied out with service, but will supply unto them many wants also there at
home, which now they cannot purchase, when they have wherewithal so to do; it
will also more fortify those parts, when every such Planter, for his own
security and the enjoyment of his purchase, will store and supply himself with
men, Arms and necessaries, for to maintain his possession and inheritance.

And do propose the fifth as most just and reasonable, that the Committee of
Grocers-hall, who have contracted those debts, merely for provisions sent
thither for relief of the Soldier, should be disingaged thereof again by the
Parliament, upon whose Commands they made the Provisions, and they conceive it
but just and reasonable (under favor and correction) that those who subscribed
to pay in Moneys upon that Ordinance of the 14th of July, 1643. upon which the
Committee looked, as a security for the reimbursement and repayment of these
Moneys, should now therefore be compelled to pay in the same to satisfy those
debts.

And do propose the sixth, as fit for consideration, that such Provisions as
have been made for Ireland, and such Moneys as have been raised for that
Service, may not be diverted from that end for which it was originally
intended; and that no private person may enjoy that to his own use, which was
provided for the public.

And do propose the seventh, as conducing more to the Service then any other
particular, for if we shall not have Shipping to lie upon these Coasts
continually, so much as may be to prevent the bringing in of Supplies unto the
Rebels, they will be the more bold in the Rebellion, and enabled to oppose us.

And do propose the eight and ninth but as subservient to the rest, and very
necessary to advance and borrow Moneys for the Service upon all occasions.

And do propose the tenth, as a thing so considerable, that to be granted would
bring in much Moneys, with the love and bounty of the people; would ease them
from other Taxes and Assessments, and would in no sort be burdensome or
grievous, and would be a foundation and way laid, to carry on a great part of
the War there unto the end of it, without troubling the Parliament and State
upon every occasion, to seek out and find new ways to raise Moneys for that
Service, and which many times comes with murmur and grudgings of the people;
and will engage many more Adventurers to plant there, when the War shall be
ended; and is but of the same nature Monthly, as the Weekly meal which was
raised lately in London.

And do inform the eleventh, that the Committee may be rightly understood, not
to seek themselves; and to show, they have no by ends of their own in all this
they offer to perform, but to act freely and with public spirits, as only
looking to advance the good cause in hand, and nothing else.

And do propose the twelfth, for such reasons as they have herein formerly
declared; all which they humbly submit to the consideration of the Parliament,
and shall be well satisfied with whatsoever the Houses shall be pleased to
resolve upon therein, etc.

account of the Service, and make it as safe living in those parts of that
Kingdom, as in any of the Associated Counties of England.
