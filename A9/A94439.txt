TO THE Commons of England, Assembled in PARLIAMENT.
The Humble Petition of the well-affected, in and about the City of London,
Westminster, and parts adjacent; Presenters, and Approvers of the late Petition
of the 11. of September, etc.
SHOWS,
THAT As the wisdom and Goodness of God is the best example to all
Authorities in the World; so those in Authority can in nothing more resemble
God, then in their readiness to hear and receive the complaints and Petitions
of any that apply themselves unto them: And who in cases of dissatisfaction
willingly condescend to a reasoning out of all doubts and differences, for so
his goodness daigned to commune wi^h his servant Abraham, and even to a
sinful and gainsaying People he says, come let us Reason together.

And surely if ever there were need of such a goodness now is the time, when
not only complaints and distractions abound in all places, but multitudes of
cordial friends to the Parliament are exceedingly grieved and sadned in their
spirits, as not seeing the Commonwealth in a condition of freedom, or
exemption from grievances and burdens (in any measure) answerable to the many
promises of the Parliament, to the affections of those that have assisted them,
or to the endeavors, engagements, intentions and desires of the Army.

Every one believing, That in a very short time after the expulsion of the
greater number of the Members of this honorable House (as betrayers of their
trust) A new Representative should immediately have been ordered, according to
that Moddell of an Agreement of the People, tendered by the Counsel of the
Army, or in some other way: And that because that honorable Council in their
Declaration of December last Declared, That they should not look on the
remaining part as a formal standing Power to be continued; but in order unto,
and until the inttoducing of a more full and formal Power in a just
Representative to be speedily endeavored, by an Agreement of the People.

And we were the more confident hereof, because they had formerly declared
also, That where the Supreme Authority was fixed in the same Persons during
their own pleasure, it rendered that Government no better then a Tyranny, and
the People subject thereunto, no better then Vassells: That by frequent
Elections men come to taste of subjection as well as Rule (and are thereby
obliged for their own sakes to be tender of the good of the People) so that
considering those expressions and those extraordinary things done ( declaredly)
for a speedy new Elected Parliament; how it should come not only to be wholly
deferred; but to be matter of blame for us or any of our friends earnestly to
desire what is so evidently just and necessary in it self, and so essential
to the Liberties of the Nation perplexeth us above measure; and we entreat
some satisfacton therein.

And truly when you had voted the People under God to be the original of all
just Power, and the chosen Representatives of the People, the Supreme
Authority, we conceived that you did it to convey those Righteous principles
(which we and our friends long labored for) to the next full and formal
Representative, and not that you intended to have exercised the Supreme Law
making Power.

Much less, that such ensnaring Laws should ever have issued from a house of
Commons so often and so exceedingly purged (intentionally by the Army) for the
freedom of the Commonwealth, as is your Act against Treason, wherein,
contrary to the course of former Parliaments and to Magna Charta, so many
things are made Treason, that it is almost impossible for any to discourse with
any affection for performance of Promises and Engagements, or for the Liberties
of the Nation, but he is in danger of his life, if Judges and Juries should
take it for good Law, which God forbid.

Also your Act for continuance and receipt of Excise (which every one hoped
upon the prevailing of the Army weuld have had a final end) to Trade more
oppressive then all the Pattents, Projects, and Shipmoney put together.

Also your act for continuance and strict receipt of Customs was exceeding
cross to expectation, that and the other for Excise being esteemed most
destructive to all kind of Commerce, Shiping, and Navigation, and are so
chargeable in the receipt, as that if what is disbursed to Officers and
Collectors were raised in an ordinary way of Subsidies it would go very far
toward the public charge, which it was hoped you would have seriously laid
to heart, and have prepared a way to have cased the Nation of both, and to have
raised all public moneys by way of Subsidies.

It was hoped also, That you would have don something toward easing the People
of the long complained burden of Tithes, rather then to have enforced the same
upon treble damages.

It was also expected upon the prevailing of the Army and the reducement of
this honorable House, That the Printing Presses should have been fully opened
and set at free Liberty, for the clear Information of the People, the stopping
of them having been complained of as a great oppr^ssion in the Bishops times,
and in the time of the late unpurged Parliament, rather then such an Act
against all unlicensed Printing, Writing or Publishing, as for strictness and
severity was never before seen in England, and is extremely dissatisfactory
to most People.

And truly when you had Declared so highly and resolvedly for the maintenance
of the Law of the Land, as to the defense of every man's Liberty and Property
according to that excellent Law of the Petition of Right, you may soon
conceive what heart breaking and torment of Spirit was occasioned by your
seizing in an hostile manner such constant cordial Promoters of those
excellent Maxims forementioned, by the commitment of them in an extrajuditiall
manner to an Arbitrary Prison, where they have been long time Prisoners, and
most of that time closse Prison^rs, their Chambers and Pockets searched more
then once, to find matter against them (things altogether unparliamentary) yea,
denied a legal Trial, no legal Crime being laid to their Charge, nor Accuser
or Witness, over seen by them face to face, as Law requires; and this to the
Ruin of themselves and Families as to temporal subsistence: We profess we
are not able to express the grief and amazement that seized on us thereupon,
and which is daily renewed upon us, in that, now after extreme provocations,
you seem Resolved to take away the life of our dear friend Mr. Lilburne and
others, not by any ordinary way of Trial at the usual Assizes, but by a
special Commission of Oyer and Terminer, the judges being composed of such as
whose interest he has long opposed; a way much complained of in the corrupt
times before this Parliament, and which we hoped we should have heard no more
of in this Nation.

And although this is too too lamentable, yet would this were all; but if we
understand the Petition of Right truly, the putting of Soldiers to death, or to
other reproachful and painful punishments, by Martiall-Law, in time of Peace,
is not agreeable thereunto, and if we are deceived therein, the express words
of that Law has deceived us.

But that such as have ventured their Lives for you, and thought nothing too
dear to be spent in defense of a just Parliamentary-Authority, should yet be
imprisoned [as some such there are] in remote Castles, and used more
Barbarously then Mr. Burton, M. Prinne, and Dr. Bastwick in the Bishops time,
and how soon intended to be proceeded against, by special Commission of Oyer
and Terminer [wee cannot but fear:] This makes our very hearts to bleed, and
our Bowels to ea^ne within us; insomuch as if no Reason, Conscience, fear of
God, or sense of Religion will put a speedy stop to these proceedings, but our
most dear Friends [because ever faithful to their Countrey] must thus be
ruined and slaughtered, under pretense of Trials, we shall not desire to
breathe longer i^ this World, as seeing nothing but Misery and Slavery like to
follow after them.

What a sad thing, we beseech you is it, that it should be thus in this Nation,
in the first year of Englands Liberty [as you would have it esteemed] which in
our apprehension exceeds in Misery and Thraldom, the worst of Englands bondage.

For besides what has been mentioned, what is more frequent then to examine
men against themselves, to imprison men by votes of Committees, to seize upon
men's Persons by Pursuivants and Messengers, to swear men against themselves;
Taxes and Impositions never so high, and Soldiers [not civil Officer] let to
gather them, to the terror of the People; and upon the least denial, either
violence or an Imprisonment ceriainly ensue^h: Lawyers in effect are said to
rule all, the Laws are trod under-foot by them, and wrested to what sense they
please, and Lawsuits extended beyond all reason, in respect of time and charge,
then [as is verily supposed] having mudded the clear intentions of this House,
and perverted the just intentions of the Army, poor impotent Prisoners for
debt and small offenses abound, and starve in Prisons, through poverty and the
cruelty of Lawyers and Goalers: and the poor abroad even perish for want of
employment, and through the excessive price of food, and few or none lay these
things to heart: And if any do, and b^come passionately affected therewith,
and but speak their minds freely thereof, or [as has been usual and
commendable] endeavor to get People together in meetings and propose Petitions
for redress, the Puritans were never more reproched in the Bishops times, nor
the Independents and Anabaptists in the late defection of Parliament, then now
all such are, with more odious Titles (or the same in a more odious form, as
Atheists, Levellers, Libertines, Introducers of Monarchy, Anarchy and
Confusion; which are poisoned Arrows shot principally at us and our friends,
though most unjustly, none hating or abhorring either the Principles or the
Practice more then we or our Relations.

To our understandings this is truly our miserable condition, and the sad
condition of the Commonwealth, and which is the more grievous (because in a
time when upon promises made in the presence of God, and with appeals to his
most righteous Judgments, we justly expected the cleerest and largest
freedoms, with even a total redress of all grievances, and which is no small
addition to our sorrow, that we are wounded thus sorely, by the hands whence we
expected our most perfect Cure.

So that what to say or do, either to help our selves or our friends that are
both in misery and danger, and the Commonwealth that lies in no small degree
of thraldom, we are exceedingly to seek, and therefore as in fit condition
for his help only, that is a present help in time of trouble, and who makes
man's extremity his opportunity, we most humbly and ardently beseech his divine
goodness to vouchsafe you a true Christian like Spirit of Condiscention,
whereby you may be inclined to appoint some impartial persons to inform our
understandings aright of many things here complained of, that if we be, we may
appear to have been mistaken, pro fessing from our Consciences, that as yet we
are confirmed in these our apprehensions of things, not only from our own
reasons, but from the Declarations, Promises, and Egagements of Parliament; and
we trust, this way of reasoning out of differences will appear more like unto
the ways of God, then by force or threats to stop our mouths, or suppress
our understandings.

Also that he will both rectify and mollify your hearts, that you may
instantly look back from whence you are fallen, To the just ends for which the
Army reserved you together, and then not despayring but the hand that wounded
may heal (it being Gods way) we would beseech you to render up unto the
People their long detained Right of new elections, and a new elected Parliament.

To fulfill your promises concerning Magna Charta and the Petion of Right, to
unbind every Burden and to break every Yoke; to give bread to the hungry,
when you see the naked to cover him; and not to hide your selves from those of
your own flesh (your present humble Petitioners) though never so much
scandalized and reproached: To deliver the captive and set the oppressed free:
and if for a testimony of your Real intentions herein you shall release unto
us ours and the Nations true Friends, though pointed unto death or continuance
in bonds, we ^ have shall be ever ready to preserve you; and we shall ever
pray that the Lord our God may be your exceeding great reward.

READER, This foregoing Petition was (October. 23. 1649.) offered unto the House,
with most earnest and importunate solicitation to have it Received, but such a
face of denial and opposition appeared amongst them, that neither the Sargeant
at Arms, nor any Member would so much as touch it, telling the Petitioners
that the House would not receive any Petition in Lieu. Col. Lilburnes behalf;
Notwithstanding they have Declared, That it is the Right of the People of
England To Pettion, and their Duty to receive Petitions, though against Law
established.
