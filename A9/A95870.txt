A very considerable and lamentable Petition, Delivered to the honorable House
of Commons, February the 12th. 1641.
TO THE HONORABLE THE KNIGHTS CITIZENS AND BURGESSES, OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
ASSEMBLED IN PARLIAMENT.
The humble PETITION of the Master, Wardens, and Commonalty of the Mystery or
Trade of the Silk Throsters of LONDON.
Shows,
THAT great quantities of Cloth and other manufactures made of the woolls of
this Kingdom, and other Merchandises have bin hence exported to Persia, Turkey,
Italy, Naples and Sicilia: From which for returns, has bin yearly Imported
about 2000 Bales of Raw Silk, the Throing, Dying, Weaving, and working
whereof, has given Employment hitherto, to about two hundred thousand poor
people, workers of Silk manufactures, in and about this City: which Raw Silk,
comes to the hands of the Petitioners (being about 70 Persons) to be Throen;
in which employment, depends the livelihood of about thirty thousand
doublers, turners, thread makers, winders, spinners and others, all which are
very poor people, and not able to live one week without working.

But so it is, that by reason of the great distractions in this Kingdom, first
fomented by the Prelates, Popish Lords, evil Counselors, and others
disaffected to the true Religion, in stirring up difference between this and
the neighbor Nation of Scotland, and by those other desperate and wicked plots
attempted since the beginning of this Parliament, against the peace and welfare
of the Parliament, City and Kingdom, and all Reformation in Church and
Commonwealth, and by that unheard of, and unparralleld high breach of the
Privileges of Parliament, and by the horrible, cruel, and bloody Rebellion so
much advanced in Ireland, against our Nation and Religion: all which occasions
of our distractions have bin (as the Petitioners humbly conceive) principally
intended for the Introducing of Popery, support of the Prelacy, and other
humane inventions in the Church, and (as a furtherance thereunto) for the inlet
of Arbitrary and tyrannical government in the Commonwealth: And by all which
your good resolutions and determinations for Reformation of this Church and
Commonwealth, for defense of this Kingdom, for sending of sufficient aids to
Ireland, for the relief and reformation of that gasping people, and for the
contrailment of those bloody Rebels, are obstructed; and thereby Trade is so
exceedingly decayed, that not only the Petitioners are disinabled to buy raw
silk, or to have it any longer delivered to them to be Throen, as formerly,
but also for want of such supply, the aforesaid numerous multitudes are
already, and in a very few days in a greater measure like to be, the subjects
of great penury, and extreme want, whose lamentable complaints and desperate
resolutions, the Petitioners hear with much grief, and whose dangerous
thoughts and opinions of those who shall be found causers of these their
extremities, will, the Petitioners fear, ere long be, too aparently expressed.

Wherefore your Petitioners; as best known unto, so likely first to suffer by,
this numerous necessitated people, and being sensible how destructive to the
Kingdom, such an intestine and expedemicall disease may prove, could not be
less provident for their own safety and discharge of their duty, then humbly
to represent their sad condition, thus truly set forth as a fit subject for the
wise consideration of this honorable Assembly.

And do humbly pray, that the Prelacy may be totally Abolished, and as theirs,
so the Voteing of the Popish Lords removed out of the House of Peers, the
wicked Counselors, and other diaffected to the reformation of our Religion,
manifested and brought to condign punishment, and so that malignant party may
be disabled any longer to abstruct your most worthy and pious endeavors in
reforming the Church, and composing so great and weighty affairs of these
Kingdoms: which the Petitioners humbly conceive, will be the only means to
give life and subsistence to Trade, and to prevent Englands ruin to arise from
its own Inhabitants.

And your Petitioners shall daily pray, etc.
