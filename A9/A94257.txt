JACOBUS VOORN Lecturis valere and gaudere.
Postquam mihi curandae ANATOMIAE publicae demandata fuit provincia, illud
sedulo operam dedi, ut mea cura tam ad cives nostros, quam hospites quibus fama
Leydensis innotuit Anatomiae, redundaret utilitas. Variis haec and luculentis
Clarissimorum virorum instructa donariis, quaeque temporis invidia, and Longa
Oblivione obruta jacebant: in sinu servat reclusa. Quicquid videt cum maxim
oriens and Occidens, omne missa in compendium via ostentar, and ne confusa
CHAOS intentionis aciem vestrae abrum peret, ita in hoc Catalogo descripsi, and
disposui omnia, ut nullo opere quaerentibus occurrant Spectanda.

IN THEATRUM ANATOMICUM, L. VGD. BATAV.
Advena, qui Batavas spectatum veneris oras;
Huc age, quae stupeas inclyta Leyda dabit;
Huc Ubi Legiferam Cererem comitatur Ofiris,
Isidos Argolicae suspice signa deae:
Frustra Deum fragilis Fortunae idola profana,
Urnam quae cineres relligiosa notet;
Lampada, ad humanos quae non pervenerit usus,
Cui magis in cultu, cui magis apta Deum!
Vixerit, aeternae tantum se pasta lucernae
Flammula, an invisae Larva sit illa rei?
Qua Lacerarit acu, qualem cui Fibula vestem
Vinxerit, unde sagum strinxerit, unde togam:
Divitis Egypti pretiosa cadavera, lata
Finibus Eois, invidiosa Diis:
Singula nosse juvet, tamen his, and inania rerum,
Et maris, and terrae viscera posthabeas;
Erudit incautum te vox facunda CRAMERI,
Et claram ambiguo praestat ubique facem:
Sic saecli penetrare Sinus, and Viscera very,
Sic poteris Roma prodigiore frui.
