BLess Mighty God great Britains second KING

Of black mouthed Murdering Malice, make him Live
The worlds true Mirror, that does now forgive
Freely foul Facts; foul Faults, which makes all those

His chiefest Charge unto his ROYAL SON Expedit adversarios nostros condonare,
memoriamque eorum ex adversariis nostris delere.

For all Earth's Potentates t'dmire, and see

Witness Gods Hand; Heaven fights for him, by good
And best of Subjects; shedding no man's Blood.
O beyond thought! blessed comfort to us all
Sent by the means of Virtues General;
No Fiends in flesh could sooth him to refrain
Obedience, true love to his Sovereign.
A King, Rex serenissimus Carolus Secundus noster, non in imperio tanquam in
virtute securior.
whose thoughts, think it his safest living
To immitate our Savior in forgiving;
Praying for Foes, wherein He dos comprize
The Funeral of All his Injuries:
This from sad Exile, sent him Home to Heal
The Bloody Wounds of Englands Commonweal:
Like Man and Wife, where both in Love agree,
King's live in peace, prudent Parl'aments Free.
