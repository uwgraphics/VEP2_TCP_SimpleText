A Congratulatory POEM.
HAil CAESAR's Dear Hephestion; Hail to all
Those Golden Showers that on Crowned VIRTUE fall.
Hail to those HONORS, Fate does here dispense;
The Grati'tude of Endebted Providence.
True MERIT to the Royal Smiles of Kings
No empty, no precarious Title brings.
HE holds by Claim and Right, His equal Due,
The Smiles of HEAVEN, and Heaven's Vicegerent too.
What tho NASSAU (War's finished Circle run)
By that Great Arm the Work of Fate has done;
Patron of EMPIRES, Europe's Guardian Lord,
To the tired Universe has Rest restored;
Given the World Peace; whilst now no longer spread
The Branching Laurels for the Conqu'rors Head?
Shall the Great ALBEMARLE less Glorious shine,
Because Bellona, with a Beam Divine,
Does now no more His Radiant Temples twine?
No, tho His Martial Eagles towr no more,
Such GLORY shall even teach his Doves to soar;
His Post of Honor with that Grandeur filled,
His very Olive-Wreaths His Brow shall gild.
Peace, and Inglorious Ease, perhaps may shade
Ignobler Worth; and poorer Brightness fade.
Your Luster a more Lasting Shine must hold:
It Is Brass that cankers; there is no Rust in Gold.
Hold then the Albion Thunder in that Hand:
Beneath the JOVE let the Young MARS command.
To peaceful Fields lead forth His glittering Arms,
With all that Port, and all those Graceful Charms.
And if again some Foreign Cloud once more
Shall ruffle to new Storms our Halcyon Shore:
When War, the Martial Britain's well-play'd Game,
Shall call her Heroes to new Fields of Fame;
Then ALBEMARLE, (an Arm so Early tried)
A Leading CHIEF, by the Great WILLIAM's Side,
Shall plume in Full-blown Glory's noblest Pride.
With all His Native Heat, His Inborn Fire,
Warmed in that Cause, shall t'all those Heights aspire,
That fix Great Names above the Power to die.
The HERO founds His own proud Immortality.
But how can my poor Muse attempt to sing
The Glorious Harvest such Ripe Hopes shall bring?
It is enough, Great ALBEMARLE all over,
He Will be HIMSELF -- The World can ask no more.
Let not mistaken Vulgar Ignorance
(Blind-sighted all) at ALBEMARLE's Advance,
To see Exalted Worth thus nobly rise,
Attend his Triumphs with Malignant Eyes;
As if these Blessings his kind Stars shour'd down
From the too fond Profuseness of a Crown.
No; the Great CAESAR, that decked Brow to raise,
First poised the Scales, before he wove the Bays:
His Smiles to ALBEMARLE not Gives, but Pays.
For that Rewarded Head this Chaplet found,
Albion's the Hand, but 'twas Astraea crowned.
Well he remembers that Rich WORTH he nursed:
VALOVR he cherishes, but tried it first.
Early he led him forth to HONOVR's Race,
Early he showed him Death's and Danger's Face:
All Fronted, like the Eaglet to the Sun,
When loosed at Blood the glorious Hunter run.
Thus tried he saw Him on the Belgic Plain:
In all the Virtues, in His Bosom reign,
Saw Godlike COVRAGE lead th'Angelical Train.
A Posting Mercury more swift never rod
To bear the Mandates of an Angry God,
Wings on his Feet, and Duty in his Eyes,
Then ALBEMARLE with WILLIAM's Vengeance flies.
War was His first-lov'd Mistress, His first Aim;
Eager He pushed, and Young to th'Lists He came.
Through His fired Veins did the warm Hero rise;
Glowed in His Cheeks, and sparkled in His Eyes.
Even with a Strength unequal to His Will,
When wanting Years His Wishes to fulfill,
Often would He murmur at the Lazy Sun,
And bid the tedious Charioteer drive on.
Tired with His Youth, in Nature's Face He flew:
Cursed her slow Architect; and envious grew,
At that quick Blood in our first Parent ran,
Who at a Word created, stepped out, MAN.
Let fainter Virtue, from a Chiller Root,
Bear only a slow Later Autumn Fruit:
Such Riper Veins more forward Harvests bring:
GLORY was here the First Fruits of His Spring.
His Truth, Trust, Honor, all together tried,
The very Inland of His Heart descried;
He saw His Virtues whole Discovered Mine,
Such fair Deserts, the vast Rich Treasure shine.
And if the Grateful Crown, in a Return
To such known MERITS, does that Brow adorn,
So near the Royal Heart the Darling Amu'let worn;
His own the Jewel, all true sparkling Mold,
Kind WILLIAM only sets the JEM in Gold.
What, though, perhaps Court-spight (Pride's natural Defect of Reason, English
Frailty all!)
To see, by the Indulgent Smiles of Power,
From some Rich Foreign Bed, some Lovely Flower,
Translated to the Royal Garden, spread
Its fragrant Sweets, and raise its Beauteous Head;
Too often with a cold Look, and murmuring Thought,
Views the fair Plant with blooming Glories fraught --
The Mounting ALBEMARLE (His Rise more kind,)
Sets forth, and Leaves the Rival Crowd behind:
Throws out the Lagging Racers of the Chase;
So plumes in Fame, out-strips with such a Grace;
That here even Smiling Envy, to admire
Such Trophies, joins the Universal Choir:
Without one Hissing Snake, one single Sting,
Does, pleased and charmed, His Io Paeans sing.
Nor does such Radiant Greatness only bear
So fair a Light, in His own Higher Sphere;
In the Court- Galaxy that Leading Star.
From that Rich Soil does all that Goodness flow;
That as He Shines Above, He Warms Below.
To His Command thus his Great Entry makes,
Whilst not so much a Martial Charge He takes;
But even a Nursery of Arms: So dear
The cherisht Sons of Mars, His Care so near;
Already has His kind Protecting Smile
Fatten'd their Glebe, and all enricht their Soil.
As if Resolved, by such Endearing Charms,
Not to Lead only, but Inspire their Arms;
Not Hands but Hearts his own: So warm a Sway,
Like the Promethean Fire, would even give Souls to Clay.
That Animating Goodness in their Head,
Where shall not such Commanding HONOR Lead?
Whilst this all powerful Influence sits above,
Life of their Arms, shall His Great Genius move:
So the High Spheres their vast tuned Measures go,
Whilst Seasons, Days, and Years, Dance after 'em below.
The Helm of Glory in such Steering Hands,
It Is thus the Truly-Noble Chief commands:
He Marches his Battalions to the Field,
In War their Leading Fire, in Peace their Shield.
'Twas thus of Old, did the Celestial Hand,
Guide his Loved Israel to the Promised Land.
One while, in a kind Cloud's refreshing Shade,
He Health and Shelter, even in Deserts, made.
Another, did his brighter Beams display;
In his own Native, and more Heavenly Ray,
Above 'em like a Fiery Pillar rod:
Their Light, or Vmbrage; and in both a GOD.
But were His Shining Trophies infinite;
Not their whole Blaze one Spark of Pride can light.
His Wreaths not Noblier won, but worn as well:
Never such Height was so accessible.
Glory His Breast can Fill, but never Swell.
No Greatness so familiar; and so free
No Temple to the Humblest Votary.
Here the Bent Knees that open Ear obtain;
Desert never Pleads, nor Justice Sues in vain.
That Genuine Sweetness, all that Smiling Air --
Sure, the whole Graces Throne is founded There.
Here, Muse, His Praise like thy Pernassus frame:
On two Twin Mounts of Greatness build His Fame:
VIRTUES to lead a Court, as well as Camp;
And teach 'em HONOR of the Noblest Stamp.
FINIS.
