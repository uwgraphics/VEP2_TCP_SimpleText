MAJESTY Irradiant, OR The Splendour Displayed, OF Our Sovereign KING CHARLES.
CHARLES, the Second: The Name, is Renowned;
The Title, Royal:
So Renowned, is the Name;
So Royal, is the Title:
It makes, even --
Rhetoric, to be Silent:
Impudence, to be Ashamed:
and Treason, to be Amazed:
He was Born,
A Prince:
In the merry Month, of May:
In the happy Time, of Peace.
But
Not so Bred, as Born;
Nor so Trained up, as Worthy.
Being,
from his Tender Age,
Sadly enforced,
unto the worst School,
of an Intestine War.
His Tutor, a man in Arms:
his Book, Military:
his Lesson, Stratagemical:
and
The Application of his Learning;
The Defense of Majesty.
He was
An Early Soldier:
and
a rare Proficient,
in so severe a Discipline.
Dolus an virtus? is a Question:
but
His Virtue, and his Valor,
parallel.
He is
Undoubtedly Victorious:
(fortius est, qui Se:)
having Conquered Himself.
In
His Enjoyments, by being Temperate:
His Passion, by being Moderate:
His Greatness, by being Humble.
This Conqueror, -- Carries his Trophies with him:
Yea and many times,
(like One of the Sages)
Omnia Secum: his Goods too.
His Life
from the 10th. year, to the now 30th.
has been,
a weary Pilgrimage;
and
(like our best Progenitors)
A Sojourners Condition
from one Kingdom, to another people.
He is
Such a Son, of such a Father;
CHARLES the Patient,
of
CHARLES the Pious:
That,
Next the most pious Martyr,
CHARLES the First;
The most Patient Sufferer, is,
CHARLES the Second.
He is,
Successively the King,
of Great Britain, and Ireland:
Proclaimed and Crowned,
in Scotland.
where
(Being most undutifully Treated)
He was
(Being in England)
most notoriously Betrayed.
The Battle at Worcester,
(Famously Memorable,
as much,
For his Deliverance, as his Valor)
was
the fatal Signal,
of the Rebels Ruin.
They had,
The Day, but not the Victory:
The Place, but not the Person:
God's Mercy, and the King's Escape;
are a Twin of Wonders.
A Prince, -- So much Accomplished,
as most Incomparable:
of such rare Deportment,
He is Beloved, and Feared.
of such Excellent Discourse,
He is observed, and followed.
of such prudential Designs,
He is Admired, and Blessed.
A Prince --
Not more Royal, then Religious:
Nor less Holy, as to God:
then Just, as to Men:
and Sober, to Himself.
He is one,
That wears Christ's Banner,
Upon his Forehead:
The Cross, upon his Crown.
A Sufferer for the Truth:
and
A Defender, of the Faith.
Such a Prince --
Whose Constancy to the Church,
of England;
and whose Arguments,
for that Constancy;
have rendered him,
(By his most acute Opponents)
not only,
CHARLES the Zealous;
but,
CHARLES, The Wise:
A Prince,
Not Wilful, but Unanswerable.
Happy are the People,
(Bona, si sua norint)
that be in such a Case;
to have such a Prince,
to be their King.
and such a King,
to be their Nursing Father.
The Lord make us,
as thankful for him,
as Happy, in him;
the Best of Men.
Crowned with,
the Best of Blessings


So prays -- and so rests -- for GOD, and King CHARLES; Anthony Sadler.
