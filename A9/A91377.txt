London, Printed for John Atkinson. March 4. Anno Dom. 1643.

A Declaration and Vindication of John Pym Esquire.
IT is not unknown to all the world, especially to the Inhabitants in and
about the City of London, with what desperate and fame-wounding aspersions my
reputation, and the integrity of my intentions to God, my King, and my
Country, has been invaded by the malice and fury of Malignants, and
ill-affected persons to the good of the Commonwealth. Some charging me to
have been the Promoter and Patronizer of all the innovations, which have been
obtruded upon the Ecclesiastical government of the Church of England. Others,
of more spiteful and exorbitant spirits, alleging that I only have been the
man, who has begot and fostered all the so lamented distractions, which are
now rife in this Kingdom. And though such calumnies are ever more harmfull to
the authors, than to those whom they strive to wound with them, when they
arrive only to the censure of judicious persons, who can distinguish forms,
and see the difference betwixt truth and falsehood; yet because the scandals
inflicted upon my innocence, have been obvious to people of all conditions,
many of which may entertain a belief of those reproachful reports, though in
mine own soul I am far above those ignominies, and so was once resolved to
have waived them, as unworthy my notice; yet at last, for the assertion of my
integrity, I concluded to declare my self in this matter, that all the world,
but such as will not be convinced, either by reason or truth, may hear
testimony of mine innocence. To pass by therefore the Earl of Straffords
business, in which some have been so impudent, as to charge me of too much
partiality and malice, I shall declare my self fully concerning the rest of
their aspersions: namely, that I have promoted and fomented the differences and
schisms now abounding in the English Church.

How unlikely this is, and improbable, shall to every indifferent man be
quickly rendered perspicuous: for that I am, and ever was, and so will dye a
faithful son of the Protestant Religion, without having the least relation in
my belief to those gross errors of Anabaptisme, Brownisme, and the like,
every man that has any acquaintance with my conversation can bear me
righteous witness. These being but aspersions cast upon me by some of the
discontented Clergy, and their Fautors and Abettors, because they might
perhaps conceive, that I had been a maine instrument in extenuating the
haughty power and ambitious pride of the Bishops and Prelates; which if I had
been (as I only delivered my opinion, as a member of the House of Commons) that
attempt or action of mine had been justifiable both to God and a good
conscience, and had no way concluded me guilty of revolt from the Orthodox
Doctrine of the Church of England, because I sought a reformation of some
gross abuses crept into its government, by the cunning and perverseness of the
Bishops and their Substitutes. For was it not high time to seek to regulate
their power, who in stead of looking to the cure of men's souls (which is their
genuine office) they inflicted punishments on men's bodies, banishing them to
remote and desolate places; after stigmatizing their faces, only for the
testimony of a good conscience. When not contented with those insufferable
insolences, they sought to bring in unheard of Canons into the Church,
Arminian, or Papisticall Ceremonies, whether you please to term them, there is
not much difference; imposing burdens upon men's consciences, which they were
not able to bear, and introducing the old abolished superstition of bowing to
the Altar: and if it savoured either of Brownisme, or Anabaptisme, to endeavor
to suppress the growth of those Romish errors, I appeal to any equal minded
Protestant, either for my Judge and witness. Nay, had the attemprs of the
Bishops desisted here, tolerable they had been, and their power not so much
questioned as since it has been. For which they saw, the Honorable, the High
Court of Parliament, begun to look into their enormities and abuses, beholding
how they wrested Religion like a waxen nose, to the furtherance of their
ambitious purposes: then Troy was taken in, then they began to despair of
holding any longer their usurped authority; and therefore as much as in them
lay, both by public declamations and private councels, they labored to foment
the civil differences between his Majesty and his Parliament, abetting the
proceedings of the Malignants with large supplies of men and money, and
stirring up the people to tumults by their seditious Sermons. Surely then no
man can account me an ill son of the Commonwealth, if I delivered my opinion,
and passed my vote freely for their abolishment, which may by the same equity
be put in practice by this Parliament, as the dissolution of Monasteries, and
their lasie Inhabitants, Monks and Friars were in Henry the Eighths time: for
without dispute, they carried as much reputation in the Kingdom then, as
Bishops have done in it since, and yet a Parliament then had power to put them
down; why then should not a Parliament have power to do the like to these,
every way guilty of as many offenses against the State as the former? For
mine own part I attest, God Almighty the knower of all hearts, that neither
envy, or any private grudge to all, or any of the Bishops, has made me
adverse to their function; but merely my zeal to Religion and Gods cause,
which I perceived to be trampled under foot, by the too extended authority of
the Prelates, who according to the purity of their institution, should have
been men of upright hearts and humble minds, shearing their flocks, and not
flaying them, when it is evident they were the quite contrary.

And whereas some will allege, it is no good argument to dissolve the function
of Bishops, because some Bishops are vicious: to that I answer, Since the vice
of those Bishops was derivative from the authority of their function, it is
very fitting the function which is the cause thereof be corrected, and its
authority divested of its borrowed feathers: otherwise it is impossible, but
the same power which made these present Bishops (should the Episcopal and
Prelaticall Dignity continue in its ancient height and vigor) so proud and
arrogant, would infuse the same vices into their Successors.

But this is but a molehill to that mountain of scandalous reports that have
been inflicted on my integrity to his Sacred Majesty: some boldly averring me
for the author of the present distractions between His Majesty and his
Parliament, when I take God, and all that know my proceedings, to be my
Vouchers; that I neither directly, nor indirectly, ever had a thought tending
to the least disobedience, or disloyalty to His Majesty, whom I acknowledge
my lawful king and Sovereign, and would expend my blood as soon in his
service, as any Subject he has. It Is true, when I perceived my life aimed at,
and heard my self proscribed a Traitor, merely for my entirenesse of hearrt
to the service of my Country, was informed that I, with some other honorable
and worthy Members of the Parliament, were against the privileges thereof
demanded, even in the Parliament House by His Majesty, attended by a multitude
of men at arms, and Malignants; who I verily believe had for some ill ends of
their own, persuaded His Majesty to that excess of rigor against us, when
for mine own part, (my conscience is to me a thousand witnesses in that
behalf) I never harbored a thought, which tended to any dis-service to His
Majesty, nor ever had an intention prejudicial to the State: when I say,
notwithstanding mine own innocence, I saw my self in such apparent danger, no
man will think me blameworthy, in that I took a care of mine own safety,
and fled for refuge to the protection of the Parliament, which making my case
their own, not only purged me and the rest, of the guilt of treason; but also
secured our lives from the storm that was ready to burst out upon them. And if
this has been the occasion, that has withdrawn His Majesty from his
Parliament, surely the fault can no way be imputed to me, or any proceeding of
mine, which never went further, neithe^ since His Majesty, nor before then, so
far as they were warranted by the known Laws of the Land and authorized by the
indisputable and undeniable power of the Parliament, and so long as I am secure
in mine own conscience that this is truth, I account my self above all their
calumnies and falsehoods, which shall return upon themselves, and not wound my
reputation in good and impartial men's opinions.

But in that devilish conspiracy of Cataline against the State and Senate of
Rome, none among the Senators was so obnoxious to the envy of the
Conspirators, or liable to their traducements, as that great Orator and Patriot
of his Country, Cicero; because by his counsel and zeal to the
Commonwealth, their plot for the ruin thereof was discovered and prevented;
though I will not be so arrogant, to parallel my self with that Worthy, yet my
case (if we may compare lesser things with great) has to his a very near
resemblance, the cause that I am so much maligned and reproached by
ill-affected persons being, because I have been forward in advancing the
affairs of the Kingdom, and have been taken notice of for that forwardness:
they out of their malice, converting that to a vice, which without boast be it
spoken, I esteem as my principal virtue, my care to the Public Utilitie. And
since it is for that cause, that I suffer these scandals, I shall endure them
with patience, hoping that God in his great mercy will at last reconcile His
Majesty to his High Court of Parliament, and then I doubt not but to give His
Royal Self, though he be much incensed against me, a sufficient account of
my integrity. In the interim, I hope the world will believe, that I am not the
first innocent man that has been injured; and so will suspend their further
censures of me.

FINIS.
