A TRVE RELATION of the PASSAGES and OCCVRRENCES that happened at the town of
PORTSMOUTH, at the late Siege, which began the 12. day of August last, and was
surrendered on the 7. day of September following, 1642.
COllonell Goring being Governor of the town of Portsmouth, about tuesday
being the second day of August, 1642 declared himself to be for the King
alone, and not for the King and Parliament; but for the King alone, against the
Parliament, and therefore to keep the same (as was pretended) for his
Majesty's coming thither, he repaired the mounts and other fortifications
without the town; and raised a mount at the bridge called Portbridge, which is
three miles from the town, and the only passage into the Island of Portsey,
which lies between the town and the said bridge, which ^^^^nd also is three
miles in breadth the other way, which Island (...) also compassed about with a
great ditch of water that does (...) be and flow with the tide, so as there is
no passage out of the said Island, but over the said Portbridge: and upon the
same mount at the bridge he placed some four pieces of ordinance to keep the
passage and to make himself wholly master of the said Island.

But yet upon the first coming of forces ^owne from the Parliament, which was
about the ^^^th day of August, he took away the ordinance and carried them
back again into the town, and in the carrying of them back, the one of them
was left half a mile without the town, because the carriage thereof was
broken, and then the bridge was kept only with ten or twelve Troopers
furnished with pistolls and carbines.

Now the Parliament Troopers went out part of them three miles from the bridge
at a town called Southwich, being westward from the said bridge, and the other
part of them at Ha^ant, which lies from the said bridge three miles eastward,
and the Parliament Troopers showed themselves on Porchdown which lies on
London way, from the bridge half a mile.

Upon Thursday the eleventh of August in the night, the whole company of
Troopers within the town, issued out into the Island of Portsey, and brought
in all the cattle and sheep that were in the whole Island, and pillaged the
houses of the inhabitants. and took from them all provision of meat, corn,
poultry, piggs, bread and corn, and left very little, nay not so much as bread
for the families from whence they took it, for to sustain them a day.

The number of beasts they brought into the town was about three hundred and
fifty, and such a number of sheep and lambs, and they presently killed the
fattest of the cattle, and some of the best sheep, wand the rest they keept
within the town, upon some ground below the mounts that round the town, but
the most of them they put out without the towne-gate into a marsh near the
town in the Island, and there kept them with some musketeers.

Upon Friday night the twelfth of August the Parliament Troopers came in the
night and beat the Governors Troopers from the bridge, and so became masters
of the bridge and of the whole Island, and they took one of the Governors
Troopers prisoner, and took another horse who saved himself by his leaping
from his horse, and going over hedges into the corne-fieldes, who had his hat
cut, and his head a little rased with a sword, but not much hurt. Then they
raised up two mounts, and placed fix pieces of ordinance, which they had out of
the ship called the Maria, which Captain Bushel boarded and took, and carried
unto Hampton, and from thence brought unto Portbridge, and placed them in the
two mounts, three of them toward the town, and three of them toward
Porthdowne.

The next day being satterday the 13. of August, the Lord Wentworth with all
the Troopers they could make, being about threescore, issued out of the Town
into the Island half a mile to take in the piece of ordinance which was left
behind, by reason of the breaking of the carriage, being one of the four they
took back from the bridge, which they brought back into the Town without
any opposition at all.

Afterward there were several attempts made by the Parliament Troopers to get
the cattle without the gate, and diverse assaults were made, and some combats,
and many blows, but no great hurt done, the towne-Troopers soon retreated and
saved themselves, and made use of their ordinance to beat of the
Parliament-Troopers, but there was no great hurt done, though some
cannon-bullets came very near and under their horses bellyes but no hurt done.
Then the Parliament-Troopers approached and came very near to a mill fast by
the towne-mount, whereon their ordinance were placed, and they intended the
firing of the mills to prevent their grinding of corn, the said mill being a
water-mill, that only goes at the ebbing of the sea: their assayling the mill
and seeking to gain the cattle occasioned many short skirmishes, and much
playing of the ordinance, though none hurt by all their shot: one of the
Parliament-Troopers upon a retreat left his hat behind him that fell off his
head; and at another time one of their men left a good sword behind him which
had been lastned to the hand-wrest of the Trooper, but the ribband brake, the
sword was estimated at five pounds by the Trooper that brought into the town:
another time the Troopers had sallyed out of the town, and were chased by the
Parliament-Troopers and forced to retreat as hard as their horses could carry
them, and there was a Scotch-man a brave soldier followed the chase unto the
very town within the gate, (the towne-Troopers pretended that they conceived
him to be one of their own company) and coming within the gate, there were six
of them all upon him, and he defended himself bravely, and fought most
valiantly, but they gave him three gashes in the head, and for all that he was
retreating and like to get away from them all, had not one very suddenly shut
the gate against him, by occasion whereof he was taken, and they took care for
him, and procured the best Surgeon they could to cure him, and let him want
nothing for his convenience; and for his valor, the Governor gave him three
pieces at his departure. About two days after a Trumpetter was sent from the
Parliament side to demand a parley for the exchange of Prisoners: but the
soldiers that were on their duty on the mount by the gate, being so ignorant
that they knew not the sound of a parley from an alarm, let fly a piece of
ordinance at him, but it hurt him not, but when he came somewhat near unto
the gate he made known the message, viz. for the exchange of a prisoner to
have the Scotchman aforesaid delivered to him in exchange of one they had taken
before mentioned, at the taking of the Bridge; so the Trumpetter brought in the
prisoner behind him, and he took away with him behind him the said
Scotch-man, who being blindefolded, was carried out to him to a place called
Newgate, and there set up behind the said Trumpetter. At another time the last
Skirmish, the Governor and the Lord Wentworth sallyed out in the night with
all their Troopers, in two companies unto the enemies works, and were by the
direction of one of the Aldermen of the town called Master Winter, whom they
call Lieutenant of Sausby Castle, who undertook to guide them, and he brought
them unto the very court of Guard, thinking thereby to do them much mischief,
where they yet found opposition enough, and upon combating they came off with
the loss of three men, whereof one of them named Glover, the Governors own
man was slain, and the said Winter their guide was taken prisoner, and the
third was Master Weston h^s man, which Master Weston is brother unto the Earl
of Portland, they also lost a horse of the Lord Wentworths, that the said
Winter rode on worth thirty pounds: the Governor at that time took six
prisoners, whereof five of them were Musketeers, such as had been sentinels,
and the other was a Trooper, a stout fellow, who was hurt only by a thrust
into the arm, the five Musketeers the Governor gained to become laborers to
carry baskets of earth at the works, but the other stood it out bravely and
scorned to comply; the said Winter was kept prisoner at the Court of Guard. And
the Farme-house thereby, where Sir William Waller lodged, which is hardly a
mile and a half without the town, and from his house in the town was
permitted a boy of his, being his own son, to come to him with clean linen,
who brought word from his father unto the Governor that the King was very
near the town, and at the furthest but at Br^^dslands, which is but half a
mile from Romsey, and that a Troop of horses from the Parliament-side was gone
forth to conduct him unto Southwich unto the Lady Nortons house, and this came
to be spread about the town of purpose to persuade garrison soldiers that the
King would certainly come, and that suddenly, and then the King would do
great matters for them that should stand close to the business, yea, they
should be very well rewarded, because the greatest part of the garrison
soldiers were gone away by night, sometimes four, sometimes six, and more or
less for a great many nights together. And the most of the best Gunners were
gone from them, and all gone to the Parliament-side; and such as were left of
the garrison were even heartlesse, and did little but upon mere compulsion;
the Kings coming had been so long expected that they were hoplesse.

And near about that time came two men into the town, as from the King, the
one of them was the Lord Wentworths man, and the other was his guide: The Lord
Wentworths man put of his good clothes, and got old clothes as if he had been
some country shepherd in torn habit, and had entertainment on the
Parliament-side and they both came into the town, and by them was the news
brought that his Majesty was about Oxford, on his his way coming toward
Portsmouth, and would be there within four days with an Army, consisting of
twelve thousand foot, six thousand five hundred horse, and three thousand
Dragoneers, and would easily make his way through the Parliament forces.

About the eighteenth of August, the Governor and the watch plainly heard
from Gosport (which is a village half a mile over the water from the town)
much digging with pick-axes, and driving of carts, whereby they sensibly
perceived that they were framing some works to make a fort, whereat they were
much troubled: whereupon they presently from all their works that lay that
way-ward let fly their ordinance that night, at the least they sent them
threescore bullets, but they hurt but one man by his own folly, for he stood
upon the work with a candle and lantern in his hand, whereby they took a
true aim, and shot him, his name was Peter Baker a very good ship-carpenter,
neither for all that did they desist, but went on day and night though they
shot at them with some respit, yet day and night they shot still: Yet (...) all
that they perfected two platforms, the one behind a b^^ne for ten pieces of
Ordinance, and another for two pieces of Ordinance behind a Pile of faggots,
though they shot fourteen days and fourteen nights, to disturb and beat them
off from them.

Upon Saturday the twenty seventh of August, came a Trumpet to sound a Parley
from the Parliament side: Who was led in blindfolded, and so carried out again:
And a Drum was sent with Answer from the Governor the same day, and the
Parley appointed. The next day about ten of the clock, (being the Sabbath day)
came into the town for hostages, Sir William Waller and Sir William Jews who
dined with the Governor, and the hostages that went out to the Parliament
side; were the Lord Wentworth and Master Lewkner, who is the Recorder of
Chichester and is the man appointed by his Majesty to take in money and plate
on his Majesty's behalf) who dyned with Sir Thomas Ier^as and others the
Committees of the Parliament, but of this Parley came no good issue, the
Governor would not yield to any such articles as were then propounded.

The next day being monday the twenty nine of August, the Governor let fly his
ordinance apace, both against Gosport and the other way at the Court of Guard
of the Parliament, side and continued day and night with some intermissions)
but did no great hurt more than make some holes into the tops of houses at
Gosport, but killed not a man or an horse.

All this time the ordinance being but two that were planted at Gosport on the
small work behind the faggots played not at all upon them, it may be well
conceived they could have done it* But upon Friday the second of September a
Trumperter brought in a brace of bucks, who was brought in blind tolded, and so
led out again, which venison had been by the Committees of the Parliament
promised unto the Governor.

But some few hours (...) clock in the afternoon of the same day, they (...)
upon the town with two peaces of Ordinance; and at the third shot killed one
of the Garrison soldiers on the mount, as he was carrying of earth on the great
mount at the gate: And cut off a french-mans leg next unto him above the
knee: which Frenchman, (as it is said) came to the Governor upon particular
business of his own, and he preferred him to employment who is a Papist, his
hurt was so great there is much doubt of his escape.

The Goverour himself, the Lord Wentworth in their own persons; all their
followers, and the Garrison soldiers all that might be spared from their duty,
did all work that night to make a trench on the top of the mount, to prevent
the (...) might come by the like shot* That upon the sight of the few ring of
the Ordinance they might leap down into that and save themselves. Friday night
they shot not much from Gosport, but Saturday they played wih their Ordnance,
and shot through the tower of the Church and brake one of the bells, and shot
against the Tower again and that (...), and fell into the Church and shot down
(...) of a house, that is nere the Church and the end of the Church, and shot
through a great many houses in the town; but killed not any body. And on
Saturday in the morning they shot at the Water-mill aforesaid, the Miller
commended it for a good thing to rise betimes in the morning, (for (...) said)
if he had not risen early, he had been killed in his bed; for a ballet took
away one part of his bed. The reason they shot so much at the Church-Tower was
by reason that at the top thereof is their watchtower, whereby they do espy
all the (...) to by Sea and by Land: and at the tolling of a bell, give inbtice
both what Ships come by Sea, and what number of horse come by Land. Saturday
night they shot but sive bullets from Gosport, but they did execute every one
of them.

It was well observed that in a small time as they shot from Gosport, (...) but
at four of the clock on Friday afternoon, (...) at four of the clock Sabbath
day in the morning, they did more execution with their two pieces of Ordnance*
then they had from the town with all their Ordnance in fourteen or sixteen
days and so many flights, in which that was accounted, they shot three hundred
bullets and they killed but one man in all that time: whereas they had but two
preces of Ordnance at Gosport, and the Ordnance planted against Gosport from
the four works could not be less, than thirty pieces of Ordnance.

On Saturday night the third of September; the Parliaments forces took Sousy
Castle, which lies a mile from the town upon the Sea, and the way thither is
upon the sea sands: the Captain of the Castle his name is Captain Challiner,
who was in Portsmouth Saturday; and in the Evening went home to the castle, and
his soldiers took horse load of provision, Biscuit and meal, and other things.
They report he had more drink in his head than did him good: And the townsmen
would have it conceived that he had been bribed with money to yield up the
Castle, but the latter was not true; howbeit the former may be a truth; yet was
that no furtherance to taking thereof: For thus it was, there were about
fourscore musquetteirs and others that came in the night, unto the walls of the
castle, and under their Ordnance, and had with them a very good Engeneer, and
with five and thirty scaling ladders: And the whole company in the castle are
but twelve commanders, and all they were not able to deal with them upon such
advantage, and therefore they called unto them and advised them to yield,
showing them the advantage they had over them: Who seeing they were not able to
withstand them, yielded the castle unto them: and the triumph at the taking was
heard plain about two of the clock in the morning into the Town and so soon
as they were Masters of the castle they discharged two pieces of Ordnance
against the town.

Now when the Governor saw the castle (which was for the defense of the town
by Sea and by Land was going, and so much pelting with two pieces of Ordnance,
and also having seen through a prospective glass* so good and fair a
platform for ten pieces of Ordnance at Gosport in the morning before daybreak,
he called a council of war; and they soon agreed upon the sending out a drum
to sound a parley which was done betimes, insomuch that the parley was begun
about ten of the clock the same day: three Hostages of each side being
appointed, viz. Out of the town the Lord Wentworth Master Lewkner, and Master
Weston the Earl of Portlands brother, and from the Parliament side came unto
the town Sir William Waller, Sir William Jews, and Sir Thomas Jervace: the
parley was ended about five of the clock in the afternoon, but not confirmed
until seven of the clock. A trumpetter came into the town from the Committees
of the Parliament, at which time it was made known, that they had concluded
upon Articles that the town should be delivered up; and that Colonel Groing
should have liberty to stay six of his servants some few days if he would; and
have liberty to take over all his goods he had there: and the Lord Wentworth
Master Lewkner, Master Weston, and all the Cavalliers, all their servants and
Adherents to be gone Wednesday, or Thursday, and Articles to be sealed which
was done Wednesday in the forenoone: and then about eleaven of the clock came
into the town Sir William Waller and Sir Thomas Jervace, accompanied with Sir
John M^ldrem and Colonel Hurrey, and a troop of horse and two companies of
foot: and the possession of the town was then surrendered unto Sir William
Waller, and Sir Thomas Jervase and the Lord Wentworth and his followers
departed the town the same day, and Master Weston and his followers. And in
the evening at six of the clock Colonel Goring took beat and rowed unto ship
for Holland, but it is said he would go through France, and that his goods were
carried to shipbord on Wednesday and Thursday.

The Colonel Goring, had ^^pelled a good minister one Master Tac^e out of the
town, at the time of his declaring himself as aforesaid: who was brought in
again into the town with Sir William Waller, and Sir Thomas Jervace: and is
confirmed to be preacher unto the Carison.

And upon Thursday about noon came into the town two troops of horse, and there
were near unto the town in the (...) of Porsey two companies of foot more.
Upon Tuesday the sixth of September was found dead atrooper, who had been
missing fourteen days a Dutch manand a brave soldier his horse came home and
the saddle blooded, the day he was slain, there was six pounds in money found
in his pocket: And the flies had blown maggots on him; which was all the men
that were slain on the Parliaments side excepting the former man at Gosport
with candle and lanthorn in his hand whom they conceive was not slain by the
Governors troopers, but finding the place where he was slain it was more
probable he was slain by a Sentinel of their own side upon a mistake.

For the provision of the town that which was most wanting was Hay and
provender, which its supposed, would not have lasted above fourteen days, if
so long.

There is a report there wanted salt, but they have killed beasts daily and
salted them therefore it cannot be said they yet wanted: but it is very likely,
they might have wanted in a little time. They had meal and biscuit enough for
three months at least, and they had salt meat in powder enough for the like
time; they had not much Butter or Cheese in the town, but there was good store
of malt.

It was conceived the greatest cause, that induced the Parliament side to agree
unto Articles, was for that they threatened to blow up the Magazine of the
town; which lies in two places: At the square tower upon the Sea side are at
least twelve hundred Barrells of Gunpowder, and very much Ammunition, and at
the other end of the town at the gate, are about two hundred barrells of
gunpowder and some ammunition: And the having the power over the Magazines, if
they had set them on fire, the whole town had been utterly spoiled, and not
one person in the town could have been secured from destruction: Had it not
been for, that it had been no hard matter within four days to have gotten the
town from them by force, without spilling much blood.

The Cavalliers, when they saw they must needs be gone; stuck not to say, they
would return again ere long, at the farthest before Christmas, and take the
Town back again: Their stomachs were so full of the business, they could
not but vent some what: But it may well be presumed, as it will be settled,
forty thousand coming against it shall do them no great harm; so as there be
shipping at Sea, as now there are six gooly ships under the command of the
Earl of Warwick, who all this time did not spend a shot upon the town, but
did furnish Gosport with the two pieces of Ordnance.

The Lord Wentworth his name, his very memorial for one act of his done at the
Town of Portsmouth, three years and an half past, when his Majesty was at
Barwick, and the Scots Army not far from thence: At which time the Lord
Wentworth being at Portsmouth, and a Spanish navy riding on the Sea there
before Portsmouth, he spent the powder in Portsmouth upon drinking of healths,
threescore pieces of Ordnance were discharged in a night: Which will be
justified, until all the powder in the town was spent, unto half a Barrel
of Powder; and that by his means the like was in the Isle of Wight, all was
spent upon the like way.

FINIS.
