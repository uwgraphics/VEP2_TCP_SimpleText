An ATC Approving of the good Services done by the Town of Glascow, Shire of
Argyle, and other Western Shires, in this Conjuncture, with a return of the
Thanks of the Estates to them.
AT Edinburgh, March 28. 1689.
The Meeting of the Estates of this Kingdom, taking into their Consideration,
That by the sending of the standing Forces into England, the Estates were
destitute of that Guard and Defense, which was proper and necessary in this
Conjuncture; and that several Persons well affected to the Protestant Religion,
at the Diet of the Meeting of the said Estates, having repaired to this City of
Edinburgh, from Glascow, the Shire of Argyle, and other Western Shires, did at
the desire, and by Warrant of the Estates, put themselves to Arms, and since
have so continued Watching and Warding, under the Command of the Earl of Levin,
and demeaned themselves Soberly and Honestly, and been Active and Instrumental
to prevent Tumults, and to secure the Peace and Quiet of this Meeting and
Place; and there being now some Scots Regiments arrived here, under the Command
of Major General Mccay, The Estates do therefore hereby Declare, That what is
past, was good, acceptable and seasonable Service, and do approve the same; and
hereby gives Order to the said Earl of Levin to Disband them, and allows them
to return with their Arms to their respective Homes, and do return their Thanks
to the Persons who have been employed. Extracted out of the Records of the
Meeting of Estates, by me,
