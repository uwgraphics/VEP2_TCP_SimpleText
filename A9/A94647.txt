To the right Honorable the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, the
Humble Petition of
Humbly shows,
THat we account true Religion the life and crown of all our Liberties and
Privileges; a pure and perfect Reformation in all Christ's Ordinances, the
luster and beauty of Religion; and those persons or Nations much honored of
their God, whom he pleases to employ in the promoting and accomplishing of
such a Reformation. Such Honor was in part cast upon our pious Predecessors in
the days of King Edward the Sixth, and Queen Elizabeth (of happy Memory) when
after the dark midnight of Popery, the day of Reformation in Doctrine and
Worship began sweetly to dawn upon this Kingdom: But Divine providence has
devolved a double honor upon this Age, and therein principally upon you (Noble
Senators) whom God has wonderfully raised up, more perfectly to repair his
House in all the beauties of Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Government,
having mightily stirred up your Spirits, heartily to resolve it, solemnly to
Covenant it, and really to exhibit some first fruits of it in the Directory for
public Worship, which we accept with all thankfulness.

Notwithstanding we are not able longer to conceal from your Honors, how
extremely our Spirits are perplexed and amazed, that the great business of
Church Government and Discipline, (whereupon the whole stresse of the present
Reformation will lean, and whereby all Christ's precious Ordinances, and in
particular the Lords Supper should be preserved from all contempt and
profanation) should to this very day remain unestablished by your civil
sanction: For, we verily believe that England was never blessed with such a
Parliament as you are; That English Parliament never had such a learned pious
and faithful Synod, to hold forth sincerely the mind of Christ, and the
Model of Church Government agreeable to his will, as you have: That no
Parliament ever had such, and so many forcible engagements upon them from God,
and unto God as are upon you: And that this City of London did never so
flourish with such a conscionable and painful Ministry (ready to put the
Government and Discipline of Christ into execution, for a pattern and
encouragement to all the Kingdom) as we have at this day: whence then should it
be, that the children being come so near to the birth, there is yet no
strength to bring forth?

Bear with us a little in this fervor of our Spirits (it is for our Religion,
Reformation and the House of our God, and we cannot hold our peace) what way
soever we cast our eye, we cannot but see most sad fruits of the not settling of
Church Government to this day; Hence many abominable errors and damnable
Heresies are broached amongst us without control: And the precious truths
which Jesus Christ sealed with his blood are trampled under foot. Hence the
pure and holy Ordinances of Christ, especially that of the Lords Supper, are
either woefully profaned by persons grossly ignorant and scandalous: Or,
uncomfortably omitted in many places, now for a long time together, which
should be often dispensed: Hence, multitudes of unstable souls have fallen off
(especially within these two or three years last past) into many strange
Sects, maintaining most horrid and blasphemous opinions: Incorporating
themselves into separate Assemblies; setting up illiterate persons to be their
Pastors: And mannaging their meetings with great boldness and insolency, in
contempt of all Authority, to the disturbance of the City, every one doing what
is right in his own eyes, and there is no course to reclaim them. Hence,
unnatural flames of division (especially about Church Government) are
occasioned, in the same Kingdom, betwixt people and people; in the same City,
betwixt Minister and Minister; in the same Congregation betwixt Pastor and
Flock: yea, in the same Family betwixt Master and Servant, betwixt Parents and
Children, betwixt Husbands and Wives: differences in opinions breeding
alienation of affection, and both breaking out into many bitter, and
reproachful contentions; Hence Orthodox Ministers are despised and discouraged
in their Ministry: Hopeful Plants disheartened and deterred from the Ministry;
Public Assemblies are forsaken; The pretended Preachers of new Gospels cried
up: Universal tolleration of all opinions and Religions pleaded for: The
Sabbaths and monthly days of Humiliation (though backed by your Authority)
wilfully contemned: And a wide sluice opened unto all profanesse and
licenciousnesse. Finally, hence it comes to pass, that the hearts of the truly
Godly, who have so long groaned after Reformation, are overwhelmed with grief
and faintings through Hope deferred: Our friends in foreign Countries,
especially our dear Brethren of Scotland, are astonished at our delays: Our
enemies at home scorn and insult over us, as given up to a spirit of
giddiness, looking at this City as a stage of Schism, Faction, and Heresy:
Our distempers grow more incurable, and Reformation every day more difficult
and improbable: And though our God has rewarded our beginings of Reformation,
with his beginings of deliverance; yet has he also of late manifested diverse
sad and remarkable tokens of his displeasure from heaven against England and
Scotland, both by sword and pestilence, because (as we justly fear) we make no
more haste to complete the Reformation in all the desirable perfections of it,
according to our Covenant, wherein (led both by your precept and example) we
have religiously lifted up our hands to the most high God.

When we consider these things, we could pour out our very souls in us. For
God is our record (and your Honors also in part can bear us witness) what we
have done and suffered in this concerning Cause of God and Religion; And how we
have spared neither our prayers, nor tears, nor outward estates, nor limbs,
nor blood, nor our dearest lives for the public; but especially for the
promoting of a speedy and perfect Reformation in all matters of Religion.
Without which we value no worldly comforts: With which we hope we shall fear
no earthly crosses; and till this be effected, we cannot expect that God will
fully bless either you or us with complete deliverance.

Wherefore we most ardently and humbly importune this Renowned Parliament (our
chief hope and help under God in this case)

1. That as you tender the happiness of this now miserable Church: The true
prosperity of this distracted City and Kingdom: The timely comfort of all your
real friends: The seasonable cure of all our deep distempers before they grow
remediless: The hastening of the Kingdoms enlargement from all its pressing
distresses, and its enjoyment of all contrary blessings from the Lord: The
exaltation of the name of God, whose glory is now profaned to the dust: And
your faithful performing of Covenant with the most high God touching
Reformation: you would make all possible haste forthwith to establish, by your
civil Sanction, that Government and Discipline amongst us, which Christ has
left to his Church, (A Model whereof the Reverend Assembly of Divines,
according to the wisdom given unto them, have framed, and (as we understand)
already presented to your Honors) which being established, we shall better be
enabled with greater hope and patience to wait till the Confession of Faith,
and public Cathechism can be finished; which must necessarily take up a far
longer time then can possibly be spared from the settling of Government without
many unavoydable and desperate mischiefs. And we beseech you to remember how
the Lord has hastened of late to load you and us in a short space with his
many benefits; as the Victory at Nazeby, the quick recovery of Leicester, the
relief of Taunton, the surrender of many strong holds into your hands, as
Bridgewater, Scarborough, Pomfret, Canon-froom, Sherburne, and Bristoll: And
what more real expression of gratitude for such high favors, can you render
unto the Lord, then to hasten the repair of his House, that so hastens the
building up of yours; as you were effectually pressed at the Public
Thanksgiving after Nazeby field, which Sermon was by Order of both Houses of
Parliament commanded to be printed, which gives us good hope that our seconding
of that now which was then preached in our ears, and took deep impression on
our spirits, will be an acceptable service unto your Honors.

2. That whenever Church Government shall be settled by your authority
amongst us, it may be established with such a complete measure of power and
authority upon the Presbyteries which shall be erected in England, as may
fully enable them to maintain all Christ's sacred Ordinances, especially the
holy Supper of the Lord, in their highest splendor and purity, held forth in
the Word, against all contempt, pollution, and profanation whatsoever, by
gross ignorance or scandal, that so the Lord may be fully for you, when you
shall be fully for him: The glory of this may surpass the glory of all
former reformations: All occasion of schism and separation, by reason of
impuritie, or imperfection of Ecclesiastical administrations, may be removed:
All stumbling blocks to tender consciences may be so taken out of the way, that
all the Brethren (though now of different opinions) may sweetly join together
in the worship of their God, with one heart and one soul: All our precious
Ministers may be encouraged to hold on in their stations, without being
enforced to desert them: And all gracious spirits at home, together with all
our godly friends abroad, may heartily cry Grace, Grace.

And your Petitioners beholding the Lord Christ triumphing thus gloriously in
the utmost purity of all his Ordinances, shall never repent of what they have
already done or endured; nor repine at what they may hereafter possibly do, or
endure in reference to this so glorious a work: But shall constantly triumph in
the praises of our God, both for crowning our Church with such spiritual
glory, and for lifting up your hearts in these sacred things, to do so
worthily.
