FRATERS in MALO, OR THE MATCHLES COUPLE, Represented in the Writings of Mr.
EDWARD BAGSHAW, and Mr. HENRY HICKMAN; By way of Answer to a Scandalous Letter,
bearing the Name of Mr. BAGSHAW; and to a slanderous Libel, fictitiously
subscribed by Theophilus Churchman, but proved to be written by Henry Hickman.

To which is added A Latin Essay, very briefly and plainly Reconciling God's
Praescience with the Free Will of man, which Mr. Bagshaw thought
irreconcilable.

All in vindication of Dr. HEYLIN and Mr. PIERCE.

Oxford, 1660.

COURTEOUS READER
That I who am Junior to Mr. Bagshaw in point of years (though not, I hope, so
very a Boy in point of ignorance and Indiscretion,) should take upon me to be a
writer, and to interess my self in another man's cause, to whom I have little or
no Relation; All the Reason that I can render is plainly this.

Mr. BAgshaw having in a late Pamphlet fearfully polluted the common light,
with the highest degree of the three worst Crimes, Blasphemy, Sawciness and
Ingratitude, against God, Mr. Pierce, and his Master Busby; and having made
himself thus too foul and loathsome, to deserve the honor of a correction,
from hands so favorable and so clean, as are those of Mr. Busby and Mr.
Pierce; I thought it fit enough for me who am but a Bachelour of Arts, (and
never intend to be degraded with more degrees, where I find them conferred
upon two such Animals as Mr. Bathyllus and Mr. Bagshaw are found to be,) to
help rid the World of its intolerable Scriblers, by making an example of one or
two. And methinks I have a call to the discharge of this office. For though I
confess I was a Schoolboy, and not quite fit so much as to come to the
University, after the time Mr. Pierce was forced to leave it (because he would
not comply with the bloody visitors A. D. 1648.) whereby I had not the
possibility of sitting down at his Feet as a Colledge-Student; yet I feel, and
can demonstrate my having profited so much by his public labors, and by his
private directions for the ordering of my Studies, (since by taking my degree I
became destitute of a Tutor,) that I hope I may say without much Arrogance, I
am one of his Disciples, although the meanest. His charitable instructions have
been so free and gratuitous (without either the hope or the possibility of a
requital, unless from God,) that I have never had a capability to show my self
thankful in any kind, until Rabshekah Bagshaw put this occasion into my
hands; which I will never let slip, but rather improve so many years as I shall
live till I am thirty, if no restraint shall be laid upon me by the interdict
of him, in vindication of whose Name I now am voluntarily engaged. For I am
really ambitious to be as grateful to Mr. Pierce as the pudendous Master
Bagshaw has been ungrateful to Master Busby.

I have also undertaken the taking down of Mr. Hickman, hiding himself under
the Title of Theophilus Churchman) in vindication of Doctor Heylin, whom I
very much honor, particularly for the honor I bear to Mr. Pierce, for I
thought it high Justice, that two such Brethren in iniquity, should be tied
together and hung up for an example to all Spectators. Nor will it be thought
too great an arrogance that I should take the resolution to deal with two men
at once, who am hardly out of my boyage, as being but Bachelour of Arts; since
Mr. Baxter has had the confidence to deal with twenty for my Two, who is known
to be but an undergraduate. I am his Senior in the College, although he Rockt
me in the cradle. Were I ambitious to be known, as far and wide as he has
been, (though more of late for his folly, then any quality besides,) I should
be as careful to print my name in as large a character. But intending nothing
more then the good of others, the undeceiving of the Credulous, the vindication
of the innocent, and the humiliation of the guilty, I do no more affect then I
fear the issue of being known. And for this very reason, I choose (at least for
the present) to write no more of my name then these two letters.

For Mr. EDWARD BAGSHAW St. of Chapter Chapter
SIR,
I Should not easily have believed that Mr. Pierce his Letter to Dr. Heylin had
made you so sick as you were reported, had not the effect discovered your
disease; of which if you were cured for a season (not so perfectly it seems, as
you hope p. 8.) you are the more endangered by so sudden and so sad a kind of
Relapse. For no sooner have you begged Mr. Pierce his pardon (p. 3.) and
cleansed your self by a confession of the former filthiness you were in, but
straight your Looseness comes upon you (even whilst you say you are cured of
it) and you defile your sweet self, in a manner so much beyond example, that
you may better be called Copronymus, than Constantine the Fifth, as having
defiled the water of your Baptism, with a filthier Looseness than he had done.
For besides the prostituting your self to all manner of scurrility against
those men, who will requite you only by silence, (whether in pity or contempt
of so wretched a fellow, I cannot tell,) Besides your ingratitude to your
Master, to which you have added your obduration, besides your palpable
contradictions and contrarieties to your self, (which make you appear to be an
obstinate and wilful sinner,) besides your ignorance and stupidity, in which
you are caught by your own confession, (and leaves you the less to be excused
for meddling in things above your reach,) I say, besides all this, you have
Blasphemed against God in such an unpardonable Degree, that this shall be the
first thing, for which I will make you an example to all your Peers, that at
least the fear of public penance may deter you from playing the Ranter any
more in Print.

First, Six direct Blasphemies against the holiness of God.
you pretend to mix some Modesty with your Impudence, whilst you say you do not
affirm, and yet (in the very next words) that you cannot deny God to be the
Anthor of sin. (p. 2.) If it be Blasphemy, why can you not deny it? If it be
one of your Maxims, why do you not affirm it? Or what may it be which makes
you stick betwixt Hawk and Buzzard, ((...)) betwixt an unwillingness to
affirm, and a non-ability to deny, what (a few pages after) you cannot hold
from affirming in diverse places? It does not lessen your following Blasphemies
that you here say in waggery, [If it should follow from this Tenet] because you
afterward pronounce it without an If. You are as positive in the thing, as if
it were an Article of your Creed. And I am now but preparing for your
Conviction. If you verily thought it no Blasphemy in print, to say you cannot
deny God to be the Author of sin, why did you blot out the printed word
[Author,] with the printed word [be,] and with your pen make it run thus; I
cannot deny God to will the Event of sin? That the former was printed from your
Manuscript Copy, is too visible to the eyes of all your few Readers, to be
denied; besides its admirable agreement with all that follows, (p. 9, 10, and
11.) Perhaps you will say in your excuse, that what was altered by the Pen, was
done without your knowledge, and (likely too) against your will, by the
Compositor, or Printer, or Corrector of the Press. Be it so, or not so; I must
ask you a second time, if you thought it to be Blasphemy, why would you send it
to the Press, and there suffer it to pass both in the Proof and the Revise,
before your self or your Corrector thought fit to mend it? Or why did you not
so mend it, as to make it somewhat the better? For considering your Principle
(p. 9.) That all Gods Decrees are absolute, and that it cannot be understood
(at least by you) how God can consider any condition in the Creature, as a
ground of his Election, and by consequence, of his Reprobation, (meaning his
Will and his Decree of the one and the other, for else you run your self
headlong against the men of your own way) I say, considering your Principle,
what difference is there betwixt your saying, that God does will the Event of
sin, and that he is the Author of sin? He being granted by all, to be the
Author of all That, which he does Absolutely will? And it is as fully agreed by
all, that he necessitates the being of what he Absolutely wills, which is
affirmed even by them that were the favorers of Gotteschalk, to be an See Mr.
Pierce's Divine purity defended. chapter 4. p. 37.
horrible Blasphemy against God; and by Ibid p. 38.
Remigius in particular, to be a making god the Author of sin. Nor is your
Blasphemy the less, but the greater rather, (as I shall by and by show) that
you say In some sense you cannot deny God to be the Author of sin, or to will
the event of sin; for you discover your sense to be the worst to be imagined,
so much the worst, that I find you speaking worse of God, than any man,
without slander, could have spoken of the Devil. And I can prove what I say,
even by the dictates of common sense. That you may not fail of a conviction,
compare your former with your following words.

Secondly, You peremptorily say, (p 9.) That God is the Sole Author of whatever
conditions the creature can be supposed to have.] First, observe the word
Author. Next the universality of your speech, not only expressed by the word
whatever, but by whatever conditions the creature can be supposed to have. In
each of which notes of your universality, God is inferred unavoidably to be the
Author of all our sins. For that the sins of men are the conditions, upon which
the Decree of Reprobation is executed upon them, has ever been granted even by
those of your way, who deny (as well as you) that the Decree it self is
Conditional. Nor is there any thing plainer throughout the Scriptures. Ezekiel.
33.8.
If thou do not warn the wicked from his way, his blood will I require at
thine hand. This and all other sins are some of those conditions, not only
which may be supposed to be, but which actually are in the creature, and upon
which Gods vengeance is here denounced. Now because you tremble not to say,
That God is the Author of all Conditions in the Creature, (of all that are, yea
and all that can be supposed too) that is, of all the villainies that either
are, or can be supposed to be in the Creature, I am bound to warn you (as I do)
from this your Blasphemous and wicked way, that whatever becomes of yours,
Verse 9.
I may deliver mine own soul.

3. Again you positively affirm, (p 9) That whatever God foresees, and does not
prevent, he may justly be said to cause.] And here your malice to your Creator
does grow outrageous. For as he cannot but foresee (who is Omniscient) so he
does not prevent, but patiently suffers to come to pass All the wickedness in
the world; which had he prevented, it had not been. And so it is palpably your
Opinion expressed in print, That God may justly be said to be the Cause of all
the wickedness in the world; which is by much a greater Blasphemy, than can be
verified of the Devil; because there is very much wickedness of which the Devil
is not the Cause, but only the will of the wicked man, as the right Reverend
Bishop Hall has well observed. And are you fit to be a Preacher, who teach the
people to believe that God is worse than the Devil? Do not flatter your self,
that when you shall come to be examined for these and the rest of your horrid
Blasphemies, it will suffice you to say, You writ these things when you were
D^unk; For you have not only written, but also done what you can to make them
public too. For which it is not your Master Bradshaw, that will be able to
excuse you.

4. And whereas you say also, (p. 9.) that you cannot understand, how those who
acknowledge Gods Praescience, can free him from being in some Sense The Author
of Sin.] You expla^^ your meaning by the fourth line going before, where God in
plain terms is called by you [The Sole Author,] as if the Devils and wicked
men had nothing to do in the works of wickedness, but all were to be cast upon
God alone. Whereby it appears in what sense you would have God not to be
freeable from being thought the Author of Sin, by such as acknowledge he is
Omniscient. And if you acknowledge him to be such, then you profess you cannot
free him from being in your sense the Author of Sin. But if you deny him to be
Omniscient, declare your denial if you dare, and you shall have a Round Answer.
Again you tell us what you mean by the Phrase [in some sense] when you join it
to Gods being Author of sin, by having said before that he wills sin, and
that what he wills he necessitates, because he Absolutely wills it, in your
Theology (p. 9, and 10.)

5. To leave your self without excuse, and without all benefit of equivocation,
you open your mind with a witness (p. 10.) where you say that the Absolute will
of God, as it is the prime cause, so it does always actually concur with, and
therefore is necessarily productive of every action of the Creature.] I will
not here show how fit you are to be Vndergraduate, if not to be sent back to
School, (not as an Usher to teach others, but as an overgrown Boy, to be taught
once more in the Ushers Forms,) by your illogical use of the word [Therefore;]
inferring necessary productiveness from actual concurrence, as if you knew not
the force of those English words: For the Blasphemy of your speeches is so much
the worst and the most Regnant thing in you, that your talking like an Idiot
does hardly deserve my consideration. You know that to Blaspheme, and hate and
curse the Creator, are some of the actions of the Creature; which shows that
your Doctrine must needs be this, that the absolute will of God is the prime
cause of Blaspheming, and hating, and cursing God; and is necessarily
productive as well of the worst, as of the best actions, because (say you) of
every action of the Creature. But whether you do not rather believe that the
three said actions are very good, as being produced by God himself (in your
Opinion,) then that God can be productive of any thing that is evil, you must
resolve your Readers another Time. If you say yes, then you hold that it is
good to Blaspheme and hate God; but if you say No, you hold that God is the
Cause and the prime Cause too of those impieties.

6. You farther add in the same page, (6 lines from the bottom,) that Gods
Influence does Act, though in a secret, yet in an irresistible manner.] And
thus you infer, with your Master Hobbs, that it was as necessary for David to
commit Adultery, as for the Fire to burn upwards: the one being acted as
irresistibly as the other, in your Opinion. And hence it must needs be your
Opinion, that there cannot be any such thing as Hell, because God is just; and
it cannot consist with justice to punish men eternally for what they could not
be obliged to perform: And Nemo tenetur ad Impossible, none could ever be
obliged to the doing of those things, which from all eternity were made
impossible to be done. And all was so made impossible, the contrary to which
was decreed to be effected in Time, by an Influence Acting in a manner
irresistible. And so perhaps when you shall be asked, why you have written so
many Blasphemies; you will readily say, you could not help it. For God (say
you) is the prime cause, and is necessarily productive of every action of the
Creature (p. 10) and Gods Influence does act in an irresistible manner, ( ibid.
and what you were made to do irresistibly you could not help. And so you are
caught in a net which your self were at the cost and the care to weave; having
proved you a Ranter in the highest degree, by an Argument never to be resisted.
Whereas you say, Gods Influence does act, and not that God does act by his
Influence, you only discover your disability to write plain English like a
Scholar, and therefore for That I shall not vex you, if you will learn some
Logic before you write next. But I hasten to your three consequential
Blasphemies.

The six examples of your Blasphemy against the holiness and goodness of God
Almighty being premised, Your Consequential Blasphemies, 1. a. against Gods
Praescience.
I now proceed unto the seventh, which very plainly (although Implicitly) you
have publicly vented against his prescience. For first whilst you say, you are
not able to understand, how those who acknowledge Gods prescience can free him
from being the Author of Sin, (p. 9.) you imply your self to be none of their
number, who do acknowledge Gods Prescience; if we duly compare it with what you
say before and after. You say before (p. 2) that men ought to look no higher
for a cause of their defilement, then to the impure spring within them. Which
if you really believe, (as you say you do, p 1.) you must needs believe that
God has no prescience of any Sin, because the acknowledging of his prescience
is said by you to conclude him the Author of sin. And if God may be so
concluded, then men may look higher for a cause of their defilement, then to
the spring within themselves. So as you cannot deny your implicit Denial of his
Prescience (p. 9. but by confessing you played the Hypocrite, in saying you did
believe, what you knew you did not, (p. 1.) And as you say (p. 11.) how much
the doubts of Prescienos are apt to perplex a disputing Christian, so you
ignorantly affirm (p. 20.) that no man yet has been ever able to explain, how
humane Liberty can consist with Divine Prescience. So that one of these two you
implicitly profess not to believe, unless you can believe two things at once,
whereof the one is inconsistent with the other. Humane liberty you believe, (if
we may believe you p. 19.) though you say your Master Hobbs does more then
Stoically deny it. And therefore Divine Prescience must needs be that which you
disbelieve.

8. Your 8th. Blasphemy Consists in the Jeere you cast upon the Scripture,
Against his word.
wherein though you say, you are taught to believe that man has free will, (p.
19.) yet you also say it is so impossible to be proved, that you think there is
nothing less capable of a proof, (ibid.) Nor does it excuse you, that you there
say. Si omnino Philosophice a gendum sit; for besides your affirming, the
Inconsistency of Prescience with the Liberty of the will (in your deep
apprehension,) you discover your mockery in the whole matter, by daring to say
in equivalence, there neither is nor can be God, if God may be granted to be a
Spirit who can move himself by his proper force.

9. For you say, it is impossible to be so much as imagined or conceived, that
any thing should be able to move it self and that by its natural force or
virtue. Against his Essence.
(p 19.) which although you u^ge against the Liberty of the will, yet it
evidently reaches to the denial of Gods own essence. For your words are
universal, and must be granted by your self to strike at God, if you will
grant, that God ^is aliquid. And if you will not, you will discover your
Atheism another way. For what is not Aliquid is Nihil. And to say that God is
nothing, is as bad as to say, there is no God. I foresee you may say in your
own defense, that you speak only in reference to the Omnia quae videmus (3.
lines going before) But I also foresee, this will not stand you in any stead.
For do you speak of all things, only visible to the eyes of the outward man?
or of all things visible to the inward man also, I mean to the eyes of the
understanding? If of the former, you baffle your self with your own Instance,
which you expressly give in the will of man. (For the will of man is invisible,
unless it be to the Inward eyes.) If of the latter, you must confess that your
Assertion does reach even to God, and becomes an Argument for Athcisme. For
(besides the Reason before given) it is not a God, but an Idol, which arises
out of certain determinate Causes. And this you know is the English of your own
expression in that place.

If in the three last Paragraphs I have but argued from your words, Six
confessions of ignorance in the things whereof you affirm.
and not hit upon your meaning, be sure you learn to write better, before you
write of such things, of which you confess you understand nothing at all. And
this is the next thing to be noted in you, that you have taken so much pains
to tell the world you are a Blockhead, or that nothing can truly be, but what
you are able to comprehend. For though conditional Election is asserted, both
by Scripture and Antiquity, and the most Learned of all the Moderns, yea and
assented unto by the ablest Followers of Calvin (who grant Election to be
conditional, though not the eternal Decree to Elect,) yet (1.) you say it is
impossible to be conceived (p. 2.) And therefore you must needs be one of the
dullest of Mankind, since what is easy to other men is impossible to you. You
have not only not learnt, what others have; but you are not capable of being
taught. Why else do you say, that that is impossible to be conceived, which is
demonstrated by others, and conceived even by me, than whom there is hardly any
one duller, your self excepted? 2. You say, you do not understand, how God can
consider any condition in the Creature, as a ground of his Election. (p 9.) why
then did you not supplicate, to Mr. Pierce, or some other) for information? why
do you rail at other men, for understanding things above your reach, or for
your wants of understanding? 3. You say, you do not understand, how they that
acknowledge Gods Prescience can free him from being in some sense the Author of
sin. (ibid.) But suppose you cannot understand how God can be a Spirit, (which
surpasses Mr. Hobbs his understanding) does it therefore follow, he is not a
Spirit? Cannot things be knowable, unless such things as you can know them? 4.
You say, you cannot understand Free Will, (p. 10.) And I believe you speak
truly. But why then do you write two leaves of Latin De Libere Arbitrio, and
ridiculously call it Exercitatio Philosophica) when you confess in the same
Pamphlet (I mean the English part of it) not only that you do not, but that
you cannot understand the thing you write of? Why are there Schools and
Schoolmasters, but to enlighten such understandings, as yours is manifested
to be? 5. You say there are Intricacies which make this controversy
unintelligible, and almost incapable of solution. (p. 10. 11.) Yes, quite
Incapable, if unintelligible. But as he that speaks aloud to every one that is
quick of hearing, does seem to whisper to a man that is thick of hearing, and
to hold his peace to a man that is deaf; so some men's evidences are intricacies
to others: and things commonly understood may to men of your pitch, be
unintelligible. But there are intricacies indeed, as you have made them, by
taking those for your Maxims, and setting them down as things granted, which
are the greatest of all Falsehoods, and the most generally denied. And I refer
you for instance to my first Six Paragraphs, showing how you make God to be the
Author of sin, without the least offer of Reason for it. 6. You confess you are
not able to prove free will, nor to reconcile it with the Presci^nce of God (p
19.20.) although you say you are content to believe it (p. 10.) And are not you
a proper man, to offer at a dispute about what you confess you cannot prove,
nor understand nor conceive? no nor imagine how the things can be conceivable?
It Is just as if Polyphemus, when he was blind, should have challenged Ulysses
to judge of Colors, notwithstanding his confessions, that all was black to
him, as being blind.

From your confessed wants of understanding, (which may well have been
forfeited for your monstrous ingratitude to your Teacher) I come to show you
the depravation of your Will too. Ten self-contradictions and willful Lies.
which will be best of all seen, in your self-contradictions, and wilful lies,
For I find you saying within the compass of a few pages, 1. That you hold
nothing but what you solely derive from Scripture, (p. 1.) and yet that you
cannot deny God to be the Author of Sin, (p. 2.) which is as contrary to
Scripture as Heaven is to Hell. 2. That men ought not to look higher for a
cause of their defilement then unto the impure spring within them, (p. 2.) And
yet that the absolute will of God is the prime cause, and necessarily
productive of every action of the Creature (p. 10.) So that unless you mean
God, by the impure spring within men, (which is a greater Blasphemy then ever
proceeded from the Devil) your self-contradiction is unpardonably shameful;
though your condition is far worse, if it be no contradiction; and that for
the reason I just now hinted. 3. That you do in your very thoughts abhor
Blasphemy, and cannot with reason be accused of it (p. 2.) And yet that God is
the sole Author of whatever conditions the Creature can be supposed to have.
(p. 9.) Do you not think it to be Blasphemy, for which Mr. See Mr. Pierces
divine purity defended Edit. 2. p. 30.
Calvin accused the Libertines, of making no difference between God and the
Devil? If you adhorred it in your thoughts, why did you Print it for one of
your principles? If you did not abhor it, you wilfully lied when you said you
did. 4. That you firmly believe men's sins to be wholly to be taken to
themselves (p. 1.) And yet that you cannot understand, how they who acknowledge
Gods prescience can free him from being the Author of sin. (p. 9. 5. That Mr.
Pierce charged your faults upon the account of your principles, (p. 1.) and yet
that you did him an injury, for which you also beg his pardon, in naming him
rashly as the Author of those reflections set out by Tilenus Junior, whom you
call the namelesse, and unknown Apologist. (p. 3. 4, 5.) 6. That He atproached
near to Blasphemy (p. 1.) and yet that you dare not charge upon him those
odious inferences etc. and that his opinion is consistent with a pious life (p.
2.) 7. That you do heartily beg his pardon for your Preface (p. 3.) and are
content to call it a fault, a mistake grounded upon presumptions, (p. 4.) and
yet that you have a just occasion to abide by what you said, and instead of
retracting any thing in your Preface, you might look upon it only as an
Anticipated revenge. (p. 5.) and yet again (but five lines after) that Mr.
Pierce having opened your eyes, as to what you say you did ignorantly, and in
the dark,) it is fit you should first offer to shake hands, and not wilfully
prosecute what you unwittingly began. 8. That you hold it more generous, to ask
forgiveness, then to persist in an injury, (p. 4.) and yet that you dare not
retract any thing in your Narrative (p. 3.) though wholly spent against your own
Master Mr. Busby,, who had done better for you then your natural Parents. 9.
That you think Free Will cannot possibly be proved (p. 19.) and yet that every
man proves it by his experience, (p. 20.) and yet again, that Gods concourse is
urged to take away all manner of Free Will, because his influence does act
irresistibly. p. 10 and yet again (for all that) that if we take away
Free Will, All virtue and piety and Polity falls to the ground. (p. 20.) 10.
You add abundance of contradictions (besides all these) if not to your own
printed words, yet to your clearest knowledge that all is False. For you say of
Mr. Pierce that he made invectives at the Pillars of the Church (p. 3.) that
common Fame did voice those Reflections to be his. (ibid.) that a friend of his
did warrant you He was the Author of those Reflections. (p. 4.) To which you
add the likeness of the style; whereby (if you prove any thing) you prove it
was not his; for Nullum simile est idem. Again, you talk of a Dispute which had
been betwixt Mr. Pierce and you about a weighty question, (p. 1.) and affirm
that Question to have been touching Gods Decrees, (p. 9.) whereas you know,
there had not been ever any such thing. Not in private; for I cannot hear
(upon inquiry) that you ever met under one Roof, or ever saw each others Faces.
Nay till you lick't up the spittle of your Patron Bradshaw, (whom you took upon
you to make a Lord in your pudendous Dedicatory Epistle,) and also had railed
at Mr. Busby for being a Merciful, Conscientious and Prudent man, Mr. Pierce
had not See his Let. ter to Dr. Heylin. p. 301
heard you were in being.

All the Controversy therefore twixt him and you, was merely grounded upon
these two Questions. First, whether Mr. Pierce was the Author of the
Reflections at which you Railed; which you first held in the affirmative, and
now in the negative; (for you confess, you were mistaken, and proceeded too
sharply upon that mistake, (p. 3.) Secondly, Wilfulness added to your
ingratitude.
whether Mr. Busby was to be libelled by one of his most obliged Scholars, for
repairing a Public School at his own charges, and for desiring an Assistant
(at his own charges too) not more for his ease, than the good of others: And
whether he might not desire the Governors, that his Usher might not be
suffered in attempting a thing so unnatural, as the standing upon his Head,
when there was Ground enough whereon to go. Here it was that Mr. Pierce
discovered the madness of your Virulence against your Master, and the multitude
of your Lies against the most known Innocence, and the most palpable matters of
Fact. You have not now one word to say, toward the clearing of your self from
so great a charge. And yet, instead of repenting, or asking Pardon from your
Master; you declare you need none (p. 5) and that you cannot say less then you
have done. (p. 6.) This is that which makes your sin exceeding sinful, that you
deny it to be a sin, and resolve never to mend.

That I may not lose too much time by setting you forth in all your colors, I
will not disorder you starched countenance, by taking notice (before the world)
how you have laid your self open by all your personal reflections on your
Superiors; in particular, on the Learned Tilenus Junior; whom you call a
worthless unknowing person, how much soever you are unworthy to wipe his shoes;
and how much soever you were afraid to make the least answer to his
Reflections. There are but two things more, which I resolve for the present to
lay before you.

The first is your profession of a strict adherence unto the Letter, without
regard to any consequences, (p. 2.) Again you resolve to acquiesce in the
Letter of the Scripture, in spite of all the Tumultuatings, and Agitations of
your thoughts against it. (p. 11.) From hence you discover to the world, what
Heathenish thoughts you have of God, when Eyes, and Ears, and Heart, and
Bowels, are by the common figure [Anthropopathia] ascribed to him in Scripture.
When St. Paul says the weakness, yea the foolishness of God etc. When our
Savior says he is the true vine: Are you resolved to acquiesce in the Letter
of those Texts where such figures are to be found, in spite of all the ugly
consequences which will ensue? See the condition that you are in, by reading
Mr. Pierce upon this Subject against (...). from p. 28. to p. 61.
Mr. Whitfeilds adhearing to the Letter, as you have done in the same case. And
yet in other places of the Scripture where God is said to hate sin, and to be
of purer eyes then to behold iniquity, you are so far from adhearing to the
Letter, that you say you cannot deny him to be the Author of Sin. Which proves
your malicious disaffection as well to his Purity as his word.

The second thing I must lay before you, is your impertinent bundle of Latin
scraps, which you vainly call a Philosophical exercitation concerning
Free Will, and which I call a bundle of Latin scraps, because you have stolen
the ingredients of the hotch potch, (which are by far the most, and the most
mate-rial parts of the whole) out of Gassendus his third tome, upon the tenth
Book of Diogenes Laertius, concerning Epicurus his moral Philosophy; without
taking notice of Gassendus, to whom you were beholding for all your treasure:
(excepting what you filch from Mr. Chillingworth.) I speak my opinion, and the
opinion of a Gentleman who first directed me to the places, where he had traced
you by your footsteps. If you did jump with Gassend in so many collections to
the same purpose, and in the same way of application, (without your knowledge,)
I shall ask your pardon for my mistake. Whether its credible that you did, let
it be judged by the parallel which here is added.

These particulars are many, (many even to admiration) considering the
shortness of your Exercitation, with which your Printer was not able to fill up
three little leaves, notwithstanding the largeness of his Character, as well as
his many and great breaks.

And now (pray) to what purpose is the little all that you have said? The
Latin Exercitation Epitomized.
you only tell us as well as you can, (that is, very improperly) what every
child could have told you, [That the Stoics held one thing, and the
Platonicks quite another, and that if any one has a mind to examine the matter
of Freewill, he may read Bp. Bramhal affirming, and Thomas Hobbs more then
Stoically denying, (what the Scripture, you say, affirms,) The Free Will of
man. After which you conclude, that you believe it for your own part, (as being
taught it out of the Scripture,) although you see no reason for it, and cannot
conceive how it should be, yea that it can as Non dubitaverim affirmare nihil
esse quod minus probari posse putem p. 19.
little be proved to be, as whatsoever it is which is most impossible; And yet
(you say in the close of all Cum nemo non experiatur se, quando velit, non
actionem modo, sed and voluntatem immutare posse; nemo vereatur asserere sibi
came, cujus vim quotidie sentit and actionem exerit, etc. p. 20.
That every man proves by his own experience, that he can change his action,
yea and his will too when he pleases. And therefore you forbid him to deny
Free Will, whose operation and force he daily feels within himself.] O brave
Usher! That is impossible to be proved, which is daily proved by experience. It
is the fullest of Difficulties, although the clearest and plainest thing, and
the most undeniable to be imagined. Go thy ways without a Peer, both as a
Disputant, and a Divine.

I will not swinge you for your p. 16. l. vit. and p. 17. l. 1. usque ad l. 7.
false Latin, False Latin pardoned
in writing a period of no less then eight lines, without a principal Verb to
make it sense; nor for your Ignorance in the use of the words p. 17. l. 5.
Certa and Infallibilis, as if they were the same with Necessitativa; nor for
putting [Certo] in stead of [ut necessaria] p. 17. l. 12. Nor for saying (...)
is the very Greek for wretched, implying that you knew not the just Importance
of the word; nor yet for diverse other things which I have promised you not to
mention; but only ask you why you say, That no man hitherto has been able to
explain, how humane liberty can consist with Divine prescience, Salvo utriusque
jure. (p. 20.) Dare you write your self a Student, without having studied so
much as one of those many, who have often and clearly performed that task,
which you say was never performed by any? Not to speak of Latin writers, Mr.
Thorndike in English has done it largely, and Mr. Pierce (long before) had
done it often. If you have read his several Books, why do you write against
your knowledge? If you never read them, (which is most likely, since you never
cited a Line from them, but only railed at them in general) why rail you at
that, which you never read? your meaning is, that you your self are not able to
conceive, much less to explain, how humane Liberty can consist with Gods
Prescience. Whereby you virtually confess, that it cannot consist with Gods
absolute Decrees of Election and Reprobation. And so you must deny those
decrees to be absolute, because you hold the Free Will of man. And again you
must deny the Free Will of man, because you hold those Decrees to be Absolute.

Well, Sir. Because the thing which you call a Latin Exercitation amounts to
no more in effect, then a Declaration of your ignorance, how Free Will and
Prescience are reconcilable, (this in God, and that in man,) I will enlighten
your understanding, as Mr. Pierce his Books have enlightened mine. And in order
to this end, I will not steal, but (fairly and thankfully) only borrow some
of his Light. All I shall do shall be to explain it to you in Latin, that so
in every respect I may fit my Remedy to your Disease. If it chance toeffect the
cure, you will acknowledge me to be, of all the men in the world,

Your surest friend in time of need. M. O.

Conciliatio facilis and perspicua Praescientiae Divinae cum Libero Hominis
Arbitrio.
Amirabilis illa sive sciendi sive percipiendi ratio, quae Patri luminum, tum
semper, tum soli competit, long exsuperans omnem motum Ordinemque Temporis,
suaque simplicitate mentis nostrae aciem percellens, rectissime (opinor)
concipiatur, si dixerimus Aeternum illum uno simplici intuitu res omnes nosse
and contemplari, sive praeteritas, sive futuras, (quoad nos) ut jam praesentes
(quoad Se.) Ideoque eam Boethius, non Praescientiam sed scientiam, nec tam
Praevidentiam, quam Providentiam, dicendam censet. Quae quidem Providentia,
Rerum futurarum proprietates and Naturas, non mutat, sed expendit; Expendit
vero, prout sunt, respectu Sui; id est, prout sunt futurae, respectu Temporis.
Nam ut Praesentium Perspicientia nullam connotat Necessitatem, ipsis inditam
Rebus, quae jam nunc evenere; ita neque Futurorum Praevisio, Rebus ipsis, quae
sunt futurae, necessitatem omnino ullam concipiatur injicere. Quia quicunque
res novit cernitve, easdem cernit novitque, quemadmodum sunt ex part Rei; non
autem ex adverso quemadmodum non sunt. Et quidem Dei scientia nequaquam Res
conturbare, circa quas versatur, putanda est; sed ad omnia eventa se exerere,
non tantum quae eveniunt, sed and quemadmodum eveniunt, sive contingenter hoc
fit, sive etiam necessario. Exemplicausa.) Quando hominem solo incedentem
video, eodemque plane momento solemin Coelo collucentem; Alterum conspicio, ut
voluntarium; ut Natural, alterum. Et quamvis ea temporis articulo, quo
utrumque fieri conspicio ut reapse fiant necesse sit, (secus enim non
conspexissem) prius tamen quam facta sunt, Unius tantummodo Necessitas erat ut
fieret, nempe Resplendentiae in Coelo Solis; Alterius vero omnino nulla,
videlicet Incessus in solo Hominis. Ille siquidem non potuit non lucere, ut qui
sit Agens Natural; At been potuit Hic non incedere, ut qui sit Agens
Voluntarium.

Ex quibus praemissis statim sequitur, duplicem esse Necessitatem. Absolutam
alteram; Alteram vero ex Hypothesi. Absoluta est Illa, per quam Res non potest
non moveri, quando eam quid actu movet, Suppositiva Illa, per quam damnabitur
quisquis est qui hinc abierit non renovatus, Posterior Necessitas, (non item
and Prior,) cum hominis (...), tum Decretorum Dei Conditionalitatem, quam
optime admittit. E. G. Ego nunc scribo, meque scripturum ab aeterno praevidit
Deus: Non tamen inde sequitur, me nondum scribentem non potuisse non scribere,
potui enim, si vellem, meditando, aut legendo, and non scribendo, istud
Temporis contrivisse. Licet enim quodcunque praevidit Deus, id ipsum eveniat
necesse est; necesse est tamen ut eveniat, ea sola ratione, qua, Qui falli non
potest, eventurum praeviderat. (Verbi gratia.) Praevidit Ille me scripturum,
non ex Necessitate, sed (...). Ita ut ejus praevidentia non omnino afferat
Necessitatem, Absolutam; sed inferat solummodo Necessitatem ex Hypothesi.
(Attendamus sodes, quantum immane distent, tum ab Illatione Causalitas; tum
Necessitas Absoluta, ab ea quae est Conditionata.) Facile convenit inter omnes,
esse simpliciter necessarium, ut quodcunque exequor, id Deus praevideat:
veruntamen Deus, praevidendo actum meum voluntarium, non facit ut abeat in
Necessarium; nisi ex hac suppositione, quod ego eum confecerim, aut jam
conficiam.

Si apud Deum praesentia sint, (ut sunt quidem) omnia; Ipsius praevisio,
necesse est, ut eodem fere redeat, quo nostra visio. Vt igitur, Hominem cum
intueor pro Arbitratu suo saltantem, necesse habet ut illud faciat, quod
facientem eum intueor, meus tamen intuitus id non facit necessarium: sic etiam
prospectus Ipsius Des De futuro hominis peccato, certitudinem innuebat, itase
Rem habituram; Rem autem necessariam, aut non voluntariam, non reddebat. Rem
enim certam esse posse, quoad Eventum, quae tamen non sit Necessaria, respectu
Causae; nihil habet in se novi apud Animum pensitantem, qui distinguere
assueverit inter Omnipotentiam Dei, and Omniscientiam, inter Praescitum and
Decretum; inter Certum and Necessarium; inter Natural and Voluntarium;
interque id quod Sequitur per modum Consequentiae, and id quod sequitur per
modum Consequentis. Et quidem si ab erroribus edocto meis, quibus ingenue
agnosco me aliquando praepeditum, (tunc temporis nimirum, cum alius fuerim,
quam nunc sum) liceat mihi de alienis sententiam far; In aliis videre mihi
videor tot hallucinationes, ab infortunio miscendi ea, quae ego modo separavi,
natas, quot ab alia infelicitate quacunque, quam quidem mihi datum est
cogitando assequi.

Ex omnibus autem hucusque dictis, ineluctabili modo videtur sequi; Nullam
aliam Necessitatem, praeter illam suppositivam, cum Actu Libero, and fortuito,
seu voluntario, posse consistere. (Exempli gratia.) Cum cerno aliquem sedentem,
necesse est ut simul sedeat; non tamen absolute, (sive ex necessitate
antecedente,) sed hoc supposito, eum tum sedere; quippe cujus consessus res est
prorsus ultronea, fortuita, id est, Contingens. Consedit enim tum, cum illi
esset collubitum, and (ordinario Dei concursu nequaquam se subducente)
exsurgere potest, quandocunque illi visum fuerit.

Aveo doceri, (si haec non sit) quaenam sit (...) loquendi ratio. Nimirum, suo
Interdicto sanctione communito, Deum meam contumaciam poenae obnoxiam
reddidisse; suo autem decreto non impediendi aut sinendi, reliquisse me in manu
Consilii mei; and eousque sub peccato, ut peccare possim and perire, si velim
modo: adeoque sciendo me peccare, (aut praesciendo me peccaturum) nihil illum
omnino aut influxus aut efficaciae, in peccatum meum exerere; ideoque tum
Praevaricationem, tum Perditionem, a meipso in solidum dimanare.

To Mr. HENRY HICKMAN Titular Fellow of Magd. Coll. and Pretended Parson of St.
Aules in Oxford, Touching a Libel subscribed by THEOPHILUS CHURCHMAN.
SIR,
THat you may see my Resolution not to imitate Mr Bagshaw, by using sharpness
toward you, for what was done by another man; And that you may feel for what
Reasons I do conclude you (though not the Author, yet) the Compiler of that
Libel, which is Entitled [A Review of the Certamen Epistolare] and fictitiously
subscribed by Theophilus Churchman, (of which hereafter;) I will present you
with a Catalogue of several Plagiarismes and stealths, which could hardly be
committed, unless by You. Your own Right Eye is not liker unto your Left, then
the Thieveries I will show you are like to those, which gained you the name of
the * New Bathyllus, and made you fit to be compared with filtching Celsus, as
well as resembled to Aesop's Crow. This is not all I have to say, for your
being the Author (I should have said the Compiler, or Stitcher-up) of the
Joce-Seria, for which I intend to represent you both to your self, and common
people; But this is that with which I chose to begin my work, which being done,
I shall go on to the other Reasons of my Conclusion; and then proceed to the
vindication of that Reverend, Learned, and Renowned Champion of the Church, (I
mean Dr. Heylin of Lacies Court) whom you have wilfully slandered in an
unpardonable Degree. And whom as I honor for the great profit I have already
received by his Cosmography, (by which alone I am encouraged to be a diligent
reader of all his works) so I shall honor him more then ever, for being
profaned by the Pen of so obscene a Pamphleter as your self.

Should I recite as many stealths, as other men have observed, as well as I,
(for I will not be so dishonest, as to pretend they are all of my collecting,
which were sent me from a person whose very Name is a stranger to me, though by
a strict examination I find his collections to be true) I should be in some
danger to make a volume of your purloynings. But I will imitate the method, and
exceed the Brevity which I find observed by Mr. Pierce; whose public discovery
of the dishonest Trade that you were driving, gave me the Hint and Curiosity to
make another; and so to find out the meaning of Theophilus Churchman. The
taking up of citations at second hand (of which I told your Brother Bagshaw) is
a generous fault, in comparison of stealing the wit of other men, with their
very words too: More than an hundred of such crimes you are already convicted
of, And therefore the fewer shall serve my Turn, to show the affinity of this
second Pamphlet with your first. But if you think otherwise, I will convict you
hereafter with many more. The greatest Robberies are again committed upon that
Learned Gentleman Mr. Morice, but reserving those to the later end of the
Indictment, I begin with the sufferings of other men.

to his Book of Perseverance.

Now besides these Authors whom you have plundered, I know not how many there
are besides, whom you include in your Et caetera, as soon as you have named Dr.
Davenant and Dr. Twisse; whose Books having not read, I know no more of your
stealths from them, than your self have confessed in general Terms, and
therefore require you to give in a Catalogue of particulars. Yet I can tell you
where you had your quisquilious Levity, and lifting up a pen, (p. 13. and p.
77.) even from the Triumviri of Mr. Goodwin. And where you had your being
possessed with an invincible indignation, etc. (p. 19. l. 6.) even from Dr. Peter
Heylin. So the Dr's hard grating your style (Pref. p. 7.) is the second time
stolen from Mr. Goodwin. Some things you filtcht from Dr. Browns vulgar
Errors, as when you say (p. 7. there is nothing above the line, or beyond the
extemporary sententiosity, of a ploughman or Butcher.] Your playing with Ne
hili upon the name of Dr. Heylin (p. 13.) is verbatim stolen from Mr. Fuller's
Reply. Many of your cleanest and best expressions are palpably stolen from Mr.
Pierce, (as I could demonstrate if I had time.) I could also tell you of many
stealths in your first Rapsody, which escaped the notice of Dr. H. and Mr. P.
But hereafter of That, if occasion serves.

And thus you have my first Reason, why the Libellous Joco-seria ought to lie
at your Door. My second is taken from your forgetfulness of the part you were
to act, when having spoken of Mr. Hickman in the third person only (as far as
p. 23.) you there betray your self, by speaking plainly in the first. And this
is done no less than twice in one Section (p. 23, and 24.) So that Churchman is
discovered to be a Magdalen College man; and no one there, besides your self,
could be so thievish, or so obscene, or so slanderously malicious to Dr.
Heylin, or so partially affected to Mr. Hickman, (who has too much of their
Laughter, to think he has any of their Love,) as to compile such a Libel in
your behalf. My third Reason is, Because although in the Titlepage the Libel is
pretended to have been printed at London, yet the Printer's Errata are imputed
to the Author's being sometimes absent from the University. (as if there were
no sending to London, or having intelligence from thence, unless by being at
Oxford or Cambridge.) A Counterfeit in one thing will be a Counterfeit in
another. My fourth Reason is, because in the very last lines printed after the
Errata, a Confession is made unto the Reader, that many passages of the Book
were (dishonestly) taken from several Authors, without an acknowledgment of the
Authors from whom the passages were stolen; and without so much as a Note of
Difference, which is usually made in Italick Letters. This in that place is
expressed thus -- [ Some things taken out of Dr. Davenant, Dr. Twisse, etc. are
not put in the Italick Letters, nor the Authors Names set against them in the
Margin.] Where I observe these things. 1. Your favorable Periphrasis whereby
the Plagium or Robbery is here described. ( Things were taken out of Authors,
without taking notice of their Names, and without the doing of any thing else,
by which they might be known to be none of yours. Neither Celsus nor Bathyllus
could have said less for themselves) Secondly, This Confession was not made
until the Libel was quite printed, which was after the discoveries of your
former stealths were made public: And in which our Churchman had not been so
concerned, had not He and Mr. Hickman been both the same. Thirdly, After
Davenant, and Twisse, there is added an [etc.] Importing many more Authors,
that had been pilfer'd of wit and language, who yet are concealed with an
[etc.] because the same that Mr. Hickman had so eminently robbed in his former
Book. Fourthly, As the other sufferers are not named, so Dr. Davenant and Dr.
Twisse are only named, without any reference to their Books, much less to their
pages, out of which it is confessed some things were taken. And so much for my
fourth Reason. My Fifth Reason is, because Churchman sometimes confesses, that
what he speaks is from the mouth of Mr. Hickman, as well as in Mr. Hickman's
name. p. 168. l. 6, 20. My Sixth Reason is, because I can prove that you owned
the thing as yours, whilst yet it stuck in the Press at Oxford, and continued
so to do until your Trade of stealing was in part discovered by Dr. Heylin,
and in perfection by Mr. Pierce. After which you repented, though you purposed
never to mend; and being ashamed to own That, which you found would be proved
to be but stolen; you tried to hide it behind the veil of Theophilus Churchman.
A couple of names no way suitable, unless it be by an Antiphrasis. For how can
you be Theophilus, who slander God as the Author of the wickedest actions in
the world? (Mr. Pierce has printed your own words in his Letter to Dr. Heylin,
p. 226. etc.) And how can you be a Churchman, who were only ordained by
Presbyterians, and by that made incapable of being admitted into the Clergy,
without your abtenunciation of such Mock-Orders?

But having spent too much time in the plucking off your Hood, (that men may
see who you are for all your mumming) I will proceed to make it appear, in the
second place, (the first being filled with your trade of stealing) what a trade
of wilful lying, and slandering, is driven by those Puritans who pretend to
Godliness only for gain, and afterward aggravate their Hypocrisy by calling
it the token and also the Fruit of their Election.

You deny in the Preface (p. 8, 9.) your having smitten, or bitten, or ever so
much as showed your teeth at sequestered men of the Clergy. And yet besides your
railing at Dr. Heylin, and Mr. Pierce; at the Bishops in general, and the
Archbishop in particular (as if he labored to bring in Popery, and had been
turned out of the Schools) you rancked Dr. Hammond with (...): p. 66. p. 21.
Ep. p. 4. and. Praef. p. 11. Book. p. 18.
Cerberus, and the Keeper of the great Ordinary of Hell. You called the English
Tilenus an Ethiopian, a Scribler, a poor Fellow. Dr. Tailor Socinian and
Pelagain. Dr. Martin the Licencer of a scurrilous Pamphlet. etc.

You boast of contributing to the relief of Sequestered men (ib.) And yet you
swallowed no less then three Benefices at once although you had no right to any
of them. viz. The Vicarage of Brackley, (belonging to learned Dr. Sibthorp) the
Parsonage so St. Aules (worth 150. pounds per An.) and a Fellowship of Madg.
Coll. (enough for any single man, who is not a greedy Puritanical Robber.)
Before you were made to quit Brackley, you pocketed up the profits of all three
at once, without the least right to so much as one.

You say that Dr. H. H. a most eminent Scholar affirmed concerning Dr. Heylin,
that he was an unhappy writer, and marred every thing he meddled with (p. 1.) A
slander so great, that if you do not recant it, or name some Author, you will
be as proverbial for your own invention, as you are already for slily filching
other men's.

I have learnt upon enquiry (of which I have made a great deal) that Dr. H. H.
can belong to none but Dr. Hammond and Dr. Hentchman, who are both the friends
of Dr. Heylin (as I am certified by some who are friends to both) and great
applauders of his works, and disclaim the having so much as given occasion to
any slander. And therefore down upon you knees, and ask forgiveness of the
Doctor before the world, or else I will make you as famous for something else,
as you have been for the Toothache, to which you pretended even ex tempore,
upon the coming forth of the new Discoverer Discovered.

You also say that he was checked by Dr. Prideaux for going a little to near the
Papist, (p. 31. that he would fain have brought some of his brood into the
College p. 22. And you tell a large story of a check he received from the
Marquess of Hartford. p. 35. All which with the rest of what you have vented
against the Dr. are at least as ungrounded and homebread lies, as the Father of
lies has ever framed. But it is no more to his disgrace, that he suffers as his
Savior, has done before him; than it can be to your glory that you have used
Gods servants, as the Puritan Pharisees did his Son.

If now with your slanders and other lies I shall abstract from your work (as
we ought to do) all your old ends of stuff, (which are impertinent to the
business, as well as stolen) your over many and long tales; and if besides I
shall expunge (as I ought also to do) your world of Libellous and railing
speeches; there will be nothing remaining throughout the whole composition,
which does any way relate to the controversy in hand, but what is abundantly
confuted in the Certamen Epistolare, and in effect by your own Confession.

Your confession is this, (p. 40.) That if you thought the Church of England
had embraced,
or but connived at Doctrines so pernicious, as Mr. Pierce represents the
Calvinistical to be, you should account her the worst of all Churches, not
indeed worthy the name of a Church.] From hence it follows undeniablely (and
even your favorers cannot deny it) that as far as you believe that the Church
of England is not the worst of Churches, so far you grant that the
Calvinistical cannot be possibly her Doctrines. Mark now my reason. Those
Doctrines are Calvinistical, which are publicly taught by Mr. Calvin and the
most eminent of his Followers. But Mr. Pierce has made it manifest from the
words of Calvin, and his followers, exactly cited from their Books, that they
have commonly taught God to be the Author of sin, and that in all manner of
terms in which that Blasphemy can be expressed; see variety of examples
produced by Mr. Pierce in his (...) Chap. 1. p. 8. but especially Chapter 3. p.
140, 141. which no one Calvinist has ever attempted to gainsay, Therefore you
grant the whole thing, for the proving of which Dr. Heylin wrote; viz. that the
Doctrines of the Calvinists cannot be possibly embrace'd by the Church of
England. Which you cannot yet deny, unless by saying she deserves not the
name of a Church, which are your own words in the place above cited. Nor is it
strange since in your scandalous Latin Sermon (of whose faults I could send
you a vast account if I had time) you rail as bitterly as a Jesuit at the
Church of England. For could a Jesuit say worse, than that [ Concio de Haeres.
orig. p. 7.
The Church of England alone has brought forth Monsters of opinions, at which
a mad Egyptian would stand amazed?] yet this is nothing but the English of
your Latin in that printed Sermon (p. 7. l. 11, 12, 13, 14.)

As for your saying that by One Dr. Overal, you meant not two, when 'twas
spoken so plainly by way of scorn; and for the work you make with Typographical
Errata, which are so clearly typographical that they make arrant Nonsense,
(which could never have fallen from Dr. Heylin) it is so much to your shame
that you could catch at such flies, as I need not wish you a greater punishment.

Now I come to your Letter to Dr. Heylin printed together with your Book. And
first, I begin with your wilful Lies. For though you had promised in the
Title Page a Reply to Mr Pierce, yet you, and all your Readers know, there is
not any such thing in all the Pamphlet. You should have said in the Title Page,
A sneaking away from Mr. Pierce. For, 1. whereas he proved from your words
(citing your pages and very lines) that you had printed many Blasphemies (as
that the hating of God is Gods own Creature, etc.) and as many
selfcontradictions also, you durst not return so much as a syllable to the one,
or the other; but by answering nothing, you implied his proofs to be
unanswerable, because you promised an answer to them; which had you been able
you would have readily performed. And 2. whereas he had charged you with no
less than an hundred and nine stealths, there are but two of so vast a number,
which you endeavor to excuse. And how do you endeavor it? even by such
enormous Lies, as will make you an example to all posterity. First, you say you
never read Dr. Heylins Antidotum Lincolniense, p. 170. And yet you stole from
him diverse times together word for word Once more look upon the Sea Mr.
Pierce's Letter. p. 280.
parallel, and say if it is possible that you never read Dr. Heylins Book.

Dr. Heylin. Mr. Hickman. Only I will make bold to deal with you as Alexander
did with his horse Bucephalus, take you a little by the bridle, and turn you
toward the Sun, that other men may see how you lay about you, though your self
do not. Antid. Lincoln, chapter 1. p. 5. l. 3, 4, etc. Only I will make bold to
deal with him, as Alexander did with his Bucephalus, take him a little by the
bridle, and turn him to the Sun, that other men may see how he lays about him,
though himself will not. Book. p. 7. l 19.

Secondly, you say you read this passage in the English Translation of
Plutarch's Lives, p. 167. (where by the way I observe, that you read Greek
Authors, as women do,) and yet you know it is impossible that half the passage
should be there; for Plutarch told the naked story, and did not apply it to the
Bishop of Lincoln: That you had from Dr. Heylin; unless you can prove you are a
witch. 3. you say you know not if Doctor Heylin did quote it out of the same
Author. p. 170. And yet you know he quotes Plutarchs Greek in his margin, which
you could not but see, when you stole the passage. 4. you deny your having
stolen another passage from Dr. White. But look again on the Mr. Pierce's
Letter. p. 288.
parallel, and then do you and the world judge.

Dr. White. Mr. Hickman. Memnon, when a certain mercenary Soldier did with
many bold and impure reproaches exclaim against Great Alexander, lent him a
blow with his Lance, saying, that he had hired him to fight against Alexander
and not to rail. Epist. to Read. bot. of p. Who (Memnon) hearing a mercenary
Soldier with many bold and impure reports exclaim against King Alexander, lent
him a blow with his Lance, saying, that he had hired him to fight against
Alexander and not to rail. Book. p. 17.

Now Sir, if your case is so deplorable in these very particulars, which you
chose to clear your self from (amidst 109.) what can you say in your behalf,
for having stolen no less than Ibid. p. 286.
twenty good lines together, and many more than so too, not by lines but whole
pages? yet (Fifthly,) you plead not guilty, p. 168. though but few lines before
you pleaded guilty, p. 167. your words being these, that they may be well
reckoned amongst the impertinences and Errata of the Book. Nay you call it a
Peccadillo. p. 163. pretty expressions of the thing! So when Achan stole the
wedge, 'twas but an Impertinency: and when Rachel robbed Laban, it was an
Erratum. And 109. Thests amount to no more than a Peccadillo.

It is a very good Jest, to find you boasting in the Titlepage, of a Reply to
Mr. Pierce, and yet confessing afterward, that you never read Mr. Pierce's
Book, nor ever would read it. p. 162. If you had, you could not have called
yours a Reply to it. Nor is it a wonder you gave your Pupils so strict a charge
not to read it: for so they might have been ashamed of having owned you for a
Tutor.

You say Mr. Pierce (by accusing you of theft) did bear false witness. p. 163.
though he caught you in the Act no less than one hundred and nine times. And
you implicitly confess grent store was stolen, by saying, that some passages
are not any ones else, but Mr. Hickmans own, p. 167. I suppose you mean the
most stupid and railing passages, which yet you may seem to have stolen from
Billingsgate: and then no part of the Book was yours, though by patching up all
materials you became Cobbler unto the whole.

One part of your Dilemma (p 163.) is very true, that Mr. Barlee had very
falsely (you should have said slanderously) accused Mr. Pierce, of being
beholding to Fur Praedestinatus for some of his citations. For Mr. P. did
immediately show the madness of that Invention in ten respects, (See Divine
Philanth defend. chapter 3. p. 139. to p. 143.) and Mr. Barlee has since repented
of it. Whereupon he is returned into the favor of Mr. P. as you may do (I
presume) upon the very same Terms. Never was there a writer more exact than
Mr. Pierce in citing the Authors which he uses; (insomuch that many have
thought him too punctual, punctual even to superstition.) When first he quoted
some of the Fathers as he found them quoted by famous Vossius, he was careful
to tell the Reader, that he found them in Vossius first, before he found the
Truth of them in the Fathers themselves, (see, and imitate Correct Copy, p.
25.) which yet he needed not have done, (but that his Christian simplicity was
very great) because the reading of those Fathers belonged to him, as well as
Vossius, and considering his years, I believe he had read them as much as
Vossius.

The implicit excuse which you make for your self, that having been accustomed
in the days of your minority to deal in Sentences, Apothegmes, and fragments,
you could not forbear it when you came to maturity, (p. 165, 166.) is no more
to your advantage, than it would be to a Cutpurse to tell the Judge he could
not help his thievery, having from a Child been inured to it. Sins are never
the better, but the worse for being habitual and inveterate. And that your Book
is like Herodotus his head, [void of brains, but filled with hony-combes,] you
well confess by your application, p. 167.

It Is strange you should confess, you having stolen some things out of
Canterburies Doom, (p. 168.) in the very same page where you plead not guilty,
and therefore who will believe you when you deny your having rifled Mr. Prins
Antiarminianisme? Though you say you have witnesses, you name not one, and (in
such a negative) you cannot possibly have any. Dr. H. and Mr. P. (beside my
additional instances) have proved what you have done. But what you have not
done besides, (as often as you have slept) none can tell so well as you, and
they that watch you whilst you were sleeping.

It Is very well that now at last, (having been taught by Mr. P.) you
acknowledge it is the odisse Deum, the hating of God that is an action, (p.
172.) But you know you were so ignorant, when you writ your first Fardel, as to
call hatred an action, (p. 95.) which a Fellow of Magd. Coll. should have known
to be a Quality. But from you who were so absolutely a stranger to Scholarship,
as to write extasis for ecstasis, and (...) for (...), in a couple of passages
which you filch'd from Master Goodwin, we must not expect any skill in Legick,
and therefore here I shall advise you, only to cut off your Beard, and return
again to the Grammar School.

You end (agreeably to the rest) with an ill-made excuse: For all the Reason
which you render, why you stole diverse things from Dr. Davenant and Dr.
Twisse, is your being sometimes absent from the University. As if you could not
be honest in other places as well as Oxford; which yet is known to be the usual
place of your abode, since the Time that you thought stolen Bread to be the
sweetest.

I will therefore conclude with a memento, that you were taught in the Church
Catechism, to keep your hands from Picking and Stealing, and your Tongue from
evil speaking. But so far have you been from the first, that what you have read
in Mr. Morice, and other English Writers, you have presently had at your
fingers ends; as if you were really an Adamite, and thought all yours that you
could lay your hands on. And so far from the Second, that your Tongue may be
reckoned the most unruly member in all your Body.

Sir, To tell you freely of your Estate, is the greatest favor that man can do
you. To sooth you up in your course, is to betray you to your self, and act for
Satan. You cannot say I have been your Flatterer; and therefore I hope you will
take my plain dealing for a token that I am

Your Friend M. O.

The End.
