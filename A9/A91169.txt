A DECLARATION AND PROTESTATION Of the Peers, Lords, and Barons of this Realm,
against the late Treasonable Proceedings, and Tyrannical Usurpations of some
Members of the Commons House, who endeavor to subvert the Fundamental Laws
and Regal Government of this Kingdom, and enslave the People to their
boundless Tyranny instead of Freedom.
February 8. 1648.
WE the Peers, Lords and Barons of this Realm of England, for the present
necessary Vindication of the Undoubted Rights and Privileges of Parliament,
and more particularly of the House of Peers, the just Prerogatives and
personal safety of our Kings, the known Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom,
the Hereditary Freedom of all the Freemen of this Nation, and our own
affronted and contemned Honors and Authority, against the many late
unparalled dangerous Invasions and treasonable Usurpations of a few insolent
mis-advised Members of the (late) House of Commons, whiles the greatest and
ablest part of that House were forcibly derained or detered from thence, where
with we find our selves and the whole Kingdom unsufferably injured and deeply
afflicted: Do, after a long patient expectation of their own ingenious
Retractations of such uniustifiable Exorbitances (which their own judgments
and consciences cannot but condemn whereof we now utterly despair; being
thereto engaged in point of Honor, Loyalty, Conscience, Oath, and love to our
Native Country, as also by our Solemn League and Covenant, publicly declare
and protest to all the world; That by the Laws and Customs of this Realm; and
Usage of Parliament time out of mind, ever since there were Parliaments in this
Island, the principal Authority and Judicatory of the Parliaments of England
has always constantly resided, and ought still to continue only in the King
and House of Peers, (wherein he always sits) and not in the Commons house; who
never had, claimed, nor ought to have any right or power to judge any Person or
cause civilly or criminally [having no Authority to examine any witnesses upon
Oath, and being no Court of Record) but only to accuse and impeach Delinquents
in and before the house of Peers. where they always have used to stand
bare-headed at their Bar; but never yet to stand covered, much less to sit,
vote or give Judgment. And that the House of Commons without the concurrent
assent of the house of Peers, and Kings of England, never heretofore challenged
nor enjoyed, nor can of right pretend to any lawful power or Jurisdiction to
make or publish any firm or binding Ordinance, Vote, Act, or Acts of Parliament
whatsoever, nor ever once presumed to pass any Act or Acts to erect a new high
court of Instice, to try, condemn, or execute the meanest Subject, least of all
their own Sovereign Lord and King, or any Peer of the Kingdom (who by the
Common and Statute Laws of this Realm, and Magna Charta, ought to be tried
only by their Peers and not otherwise) or to disinherit the Right heir to the
Crown, or to alter the Fundamental Government, Laws, Great Seal, or ancient
forms of process and legal Proceedings of this Realm, or to make or declare
High Treason to be no Treason; or any Act to be Treason, which in it self, or
by the Law of the Land is no Treason; or to dispose of any Offices or places of
Judicature, or impose any penalties, Oaths, or Taxes, on the Subjects of this
Realm. And therefore we do here in the presence of Almighty God, Angels, and
Men, from our hearts disclaim, abhor, and protest against all Acts, Votes,
Orders or Ordinances of the said Members of the Commons house lately made and
published, for setting up any New court of Justice to try, condemen, or execute
the King, or any Peer or Subject of this Realm: (which for any person or
persons to sit in or act as a Judge or Commissioner, to the condemning or taking
away the life of the K. or any Peer or other subject, we declare to be High
Treason and wilful Murder) to difinherit the Prince of Wales of the Crown of
England, or against proclaiming him King after his Royal Faeherslate most
impious, Traiterous and barbarous murder, or to alter the Monarchical
Government, Laws; Great Seal, Iudicatories, and ancient forms of writs, and
legal process and proceedings; or to keep up or make good any Commissions,
Judges or Officers, made void by the Kings bloody execution; or to continue any
old, or raise any new forces or Armies; or to impose any New Taxes, Payments,
Oaths or forfeitures on the Subjects, or to take away any of their lives,
Liberties or Estates against the fundamental laws of the Realm, or to make
any new Judges, Justices or Officers; Or set aside the House of Peers (far
ancienter then the Commons house) and particularly this insolent and frantique
vote of theirs, Febr. 6. ( That the House of Peers in Parliament is useless
and dangerous and ought to be abolished, and that an act be brought in for that
purpose) to be not only void, null, and illegal in themselves by the Laws and
Statutes of this Realm, but likewise Treasonable, Detestable, Tyrannical, and
destructive to the Privileges, Rights and being of Parliaments, the just
Prerogatives and personal safety of the Kings of England, the fundamental
Government and Laws of the Realm, the Lives, Liberties, Propertyes and
Estates of the People, and the most transcendent Tyranny and Usurpation over
the King, Kingdom, Parliament, Peers, Commons, and Freeemen of England ever
practiced or attempted in any age, tending only to dishonor, enslave, and
destroy this ancient flourishing Kingdom, and set up Anarchy and confusion in
all places.

All which exorbitant and Traiterous Usurpations: We, and all freeborn
English men are by all obligations bound to oppose to the uttermost with our
lives and forunes least we should be accessories to our own and our posterities
slavery and ruin, for preventing whereof we have lately spent so much blood
and, Treasure, against the Malignant party, whose Treasons and insolences they
far exceed

FINIS.
