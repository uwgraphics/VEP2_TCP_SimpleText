To the Right Honorable THE COUNCIL OF STATE, Appointed by Authority of
PARLIAMENT, For the Government of these three Kingdoms, during the interval of
Parliaments,
The Humble Petition of many thousand Citizens and Freemen of London, and other
the VVell-affected People of the Nation, for the further securing of John
Lambert, whose Releasement may embolden the Sectarian Faction to attempt the
Disturbance of the Nations Peace,
Humbly Shows,
THat your Petitioners have a very great sense of the many afflictions,
inflicted upon these poor distressed Nations, and of the many endeavors of the
Mad and Fanatic Party, to entrench upon their Liberties, and to involve them
still into more and more ruin, to their utter fall and destruction, had not
the Almighty God, of his infinite Mercy been pleased to restrain in some
measure his afflicting hand, and restore their breaches, by re-calling the
Secluded Members, of the late Parliament, and re-estating them in their trusts,
to the Confusion we hope of those Malevolent Spirits, who for the furtherance
(...) own private ends and Interests, have endeavored the Ruin and
Destruction of these three Kingdoms.

That the said Parliament, having devolved their power into the Hands of this
Right Honorable Council, during the present interval, we cannot but hope that
your Honors will be pleased still to proceed in those good ways which the
Parliament begun, for the settlement of these Nations in Peace and Quietness,
and for the depressing the designs of the Anabaptists, Independents,
Fift-Monarchy men, Quakers, and the rest of the Sectarian Rabble, whose
Malevolent Spirits can never be content with any Government but their own, and
who have so often endeavored to usurp an unjust, illegal, and Tyrannical power
over the Nations, and reduce them to a slavery under them and their Heretical
Opinions.

That your honors cannot but be highly sensible of these their many and
violent endeavors, fomented by the Envy and Ambition of such men, who though
they cannot allow of their Opinions, yet would willingly condescend unto them,
so that they do but contribute to the accomplishing of their ends and desires;
and who seeing that their Ambition fails them, Extend their Envy to the utmost,
resolving, that if they cannot govern themselves, they will endeavor the ruin
of any Government, though never so well established either in Church or State.

That though it has pleased our merciful God and Father, hitherto to
frustrate all the designs and desires of that Factious and Malignant Party, yet
we have reason to fear (Considering their late intentions, the many Arms and
Ammunition, etc. taken from them) that their hopes of reign are not yet
Quelled, but that they will still seek all possible means and opportunities, to
subvert any Government, which may but in probability tend to the Quiet and
settlement of these Nations, as being necessarily contrary to the designs and
Interests of those turbulent minded men.

That your Petitioners upon serious Consideration of these things, as Lovers of
their Countries Peace and Quietness, have thought fit humbly to present these
things to your Honors, especially weighing the great encouragement which will
be given to these Sectaries and Fanatics, by the Releasement of Major General
Lambert their Head and Chief out of the Tower, whereby they will be emboldened
to attempt and endeavor more desperate and dangerous things to the Disturbance
of our Rest and Peace.

That we likewise humbly conceive, that the said General Lambert may legally
stand indicted of High Treason, if the breach of the Privileges of Parliament
(upon which pretense Our late Glorious King suffered Martyrdom) may be so
deemed, he having by no Law, but only that of Arms, infringed that which sat
as a Parliament of their Privileges and Sitting, and by a Military force driven
them out of the House.

Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray, (since the Vote of the late Parliament
leaves it wholly to your Honors Pleasure, whether the said Lambert shall be
released upon Security, Paroll, or not,) that your Honors would so far regard
the Good and Welfare of these Nations, as not to permit the Releasement of a
Person, whose turbulent and ambitious Spirit might so far disquiet our Peace,
but to bring him to a speedy trial to answer for his Rebellions and Treasons.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray, etc.
