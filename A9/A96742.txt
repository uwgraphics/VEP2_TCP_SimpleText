Carmen Eucharisticon: A PRIVATE THANK-OBLATION, Exhibited to the Glory of THE
LORD OF HOSTS, FOR The timely and wonderful Deliverance, vouchsafed to this
NATION, in the routing of a numerous Army of Irish Rebels before Dublin, by
the Sword of his valiant Servant, MICHAEL JONES, Lievtenant-Generall for the
Parliament of ENGLAND.

Composed by Geo. Wither Esquire, August 29. 1649.

The longest lasting Sacrifice
Is that, which most neglected lies.
Sweet Incense into nothing fumes;
The Fat of Beasts away consumes;
A Song, which does GOD's Works commend,
Continues longer; yet, has end:
But perfect-love is an Oblation,
Which has no final consumation.
Aug: 30 London: Printed by Robert Austin. 1649.

Carmen Eucharisticon: A PRIVATE THANK-OBLATION, EXHIBITED To the Glory of the
LORD OF HOSTS, etc.
PVblike-Duties being done,
By my self, I Will now alone,
Consummate a Private-one.
Therefore, O my Soul! awake;
And, let both, with heart and tongue,
Such a Song of Praise be sung,
That, thereby, both old and young,
Of GOD's mercies heed may take.
For, such Trophies (though now waved)
Moses, Deborah, and David,
When they from their foes were saved,
Did, with good acceptance, raise:
And (though other Thank-Oblations
Perished, with their Generations)
GOD is, yet, throughout all Nations,
Honored by their Songs of Praise.
We, to thee, O LORD! have praid,
Thanks returned, sung, and said,
And, our common-duty paid,
As we could perform the same:
That, which we have seen, and heard,
Of thy merciful regard,
Has been openly declared,
To the glory of thy Name.
But, O GOD! we may as well
Close the Seas up, in a shell,
As enabled be to tell
Thy Compassions large extent;
Or, to make full illustration
Of thy favors to this Nation,
In our frequent preservation
From the furious Foes intent.
For, that single-mercy, LORD,
Which this Day we do record,
Many mercies does afford,
More then all men can perceive.
That Deliverance, made way
For another joyfull-day,
And that, peradventure, may
Bring to pass, what we would have.
With vain Moab, did conspire
Ammon, Amalek, and Tire,
Threatening, like consuming fire,
To destroy thy chosen Flock;
And, in hope, their will to do,
They have hired Balaam too,
With false Prophets many more,
To advance a stumbling block.
Of their vain presumings proud,
They like Thunder from a cloud,
Did begin to roar aloud
In deluded peoples ears;
And their empty vanities,
Blushlesse brags, and shameless lies,
Filled the hearts of men unwise,
With false hopes, and causeless fears.
The fooled Welsh, the faithless Scot,
And our English mis-begot,
Joining in an Irish plot,
Sought to root us from the Land:
They with Sulphur, Sword, and Flame,
Round about our dwellings came,
And, had brought us all to shame,
Had not, GOD, stretched forth his hand.
But, he, thereof notice took;
And, as Sisera he struck,
With his Host, by Kishon-brook;
So, he smote them in their pride:
And, the same success they had
Which befell to Benhadad,
When, the like account he made,
That, the spoil he should divide.
For, whilst Ormond, and while Taaff,
In their Tents, did game, and quaff,
(At our sad condition laugh)
And, of Captives predispos'd;
Then, that Arm, which they despised,
Suddenly, their Camp surpised;
And, the snares, which they devised
For our feet, their own enclosed.
Mich'el, and his Angels, there
Threw their Dragon-Cavaliere,
With his Angels, from our Sphere,
In confusion, to their own;
Where, unable to repent,
They despairingly lament,
And blaspheme with discontent,
Him, that has such mercy shown.
For, though (blinded in their sin)
Outwardly, they jeer and grin;
Hellish horrors lurk within,
Filling their faint hearts with fears:
Their chief refuge, is a lie;
And, which way soever they fly,
Guilt pursues them with a cry,
Which the GOD of Justice hears.
Their accusing conscience, feels
Vengeance following them at heels,
And, her dreadful Charet wheels
Threatening, what to them is due:
Yet, infernal indignation,
Stirs them up to vindication,
Height'ned by a desperation
Of those ends, which they pursue.
And, that made them take the field,
(Trusting in their sword and shield)
When their conscience bid them yield:
But, they soon did back retire,
And, to fly away began,
As when the Philistines ran,
From the sword of Jonathan,
And, but one slight armed Squire.
Never was there such a day
Seen till then at Dublin.
Ballacleagh,
Since the The River at Dublin.
Liffy washed her Kea,
And, there, first, the The Sea Water.
Sea-Nimphs met:
For, GOD's arm, did there, and then,
Give us Limster back again,
When it was nigh lost; and, when,
Hope, was with despairs beset.
Yet, as if that days success,
Had too little been, unless
He considered our distress,
In our Londonderry friends;
Or, lest else, blind ignorance
Might judge, that an act of chance,
He, our free deliverance,
Into Vlster, too, extends.
And, by that redoubled blow,
Gave another overthrow;
For, Designements one or two,
By that means dissolved be:
Which has so enraged them,
That, they rail, revile, blaspheme,
And their own belief condemn,
For believing what they see.
Oh! what pen, or tongue is there
Fully able to declare,
What, to us, GOD'S Mercies were
Since our Champion he has been?
Nay, who can half that recite,
Which for us, in open sight,
He has done since Nasby-Fight,
Where, he, first, was plainly seen?
He has magnified his worth
In most glorious marchings forth,
From the South, unto the North,
And, through all our British-Coasts;
England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales,
Towns, and Fields, and Hills, and Dales,
Sea, and Land, him, justly calls
The Victorious LORD of HOASTS.
Frequently, our eyes behold,
Mercies, great and manifold,
Such, as were in times of old,
By his Chosen Flock enjoyed:
Such, as were vouchsafed, when
Hundreds, chased were by ten;
Thousands, by a hundred men,
And great Hoasts, by few destroyed.
We have seen God marching, so,
With our Friends, against our Foe,
As he did, long time ago,
When his- Israel were oppressed:
And, securing us from fear;
When our hopes at lowest were;
When despised, we did appear,
And our-perill most increast.
When all seemed at once on fire;
When our Brethren did conspire,
With our Foes, to blow that higher,
Which did flame too high, before;
When within their hearts they said,
We so deep, our Plots have laid,
That divine, with humane aid,
Shall prevent them, now no more.
Yea, when said it was by some,
What is of their God become,
Who, they dreamed, should save them from
What our Counsel has decreed?
Then, did God, himself, arise;
Then, his Arm, in glorious wise,
Saves us from our Enemies,
In the times of greatest need.
And not only from their power,
(Armed, and gaping to devour,)
Has he kept this Land of our,
But, he more then this has done;
Them, who to inslave us thought,
And, our causlesse ruin sought,
Underneath our feet he brought,
That they might be trod upon.
Nay, we have, yet more to say:
Though our Foes, lie night and day,
In our bosoms, to betray;
And disguised are like Friends;
God, has still prevented so,
What their malice prompts them to,
That, themselves, they still undo;
But, accomplish not their ends.
We have seen GOD, in our days,
VValking on, in all those ways,
Which (to his eternal praise)
Were in former Ages, trod:
In our joys, and when we weep,
In our wakings, in our sleep,
On the Heights, and in the Deep,
We have seen thy steps O GOD!
We have seen, here, where we dwell,
Works of thine, which parallel
All that ancient-stories tell
Touching either Foes, or Friends.
Yea, if all Records were lost,
We by that, which now thou do,
Might collect what do we must,
And, what each man's way attends.
We have seen (and see we shall)
What to Pharaoh did befall,
And ordained is for all
Who shall obstinate remain:
We have seen, that upon such,
Plagues, or Mercies work not much,
And, that these two often touch
On some, softened hearts, in vain.
We have known men, once or twice,
Warned; yea, afflicted thrice;
Yet, habituated Vice,
In her posture does abide
And, her Lovers, without stop,
Prosecute their fruitless hope,
Though their Partners daily drop,
Down to hell, on every side.
We have seen the pride of Kings,
With those much desired things,
Whence their vain ambition springs,
Scorned, despised, and set at naught.
We, their silk, their pearls, their gold,
And their prccious Jemms, behold
Scattred, pawned, bought and sold;
And to shame, their glory brought.
We have seen fair seeming Stars,
Thither tumbled from high Spears,
Where their vanity appears;
And that wisemen may dispense
With deluding Sophistries,
To promote, what they devise,
Till they put their trust in lies,
Through a reprobated sense.
We have seen, when GOD, once, makes
Search for Blood, what hills he shakes;
What high Cedars, down he breaks;
And what portion he prepares
For Apostates, Balaamites,
For blood-thirsty Canaanites,
And self-seeking Hypocrites,
When their sin at full appears.
All these things, and many more
Such as these, we see and know:
Oh! that we could mind them too!
And our lives thereby amend:
For his Mercy shown of late,
(And which we commemorate,
By Commandment from the State)
Was vouchsafed to that end.
Let us therefore not suppose,
It Is enough to do like those,
Who make only Verbal shows
Of the duties in command;
For, unless, in deeds, as well
As in words, our thanks we tell,
As unthankfully we deal,
As if we had cursed, and ban'd.
Yea, although our Temples ring
Of GODS praise; though loud we sing,
And all those Thank-offrings bring,
Which the Formalist oblates;
Yet, if we perform no more,
He our presents does abhor,
As the hiring of a whore,
And our vain Lip-service hates.
If, we therewith, do not heed,
How with us GOD does proceed;
And, how, he at every need,
Hears us, timely, when we call,
That, to such, as helpless lie,
We may yield the like supply,
When to us, for help they cry;
We, ere long time, rue it shall.
Yea, unless we pity more
The oppressions of the poor,
Then we-have done heretofore,
And to Justice more adhere;
This, will prove but a delusion,
And all mercies in conclusion,
Bring upon us just confusion,
When such vengeance we least fear.
Still, in selfnesse if we live;
Much receive, but nothing give;
Cheer our selves, and others grieve;
We are in the way of death:
And, of whatsoever esteem,
In our own conceits, we seem,
God will cast us quite from him,
If we settle in that path.
For, it is for nothing less
Then this Nations righteousness,
Or, our sakes, that GOD does bless
Those designs we undertake:
But, it is rather from their sin,
Who have our opposers been,
Whence our Victories begin,
And, for GOD's free mercy sake.
For no goodness of our own,
Did GOD's hand the King uncrowne,
And pull other Tyrants down;
Nor, because, he, yet, does see
That our zealous Protestations,
Or pretended Reformations
Of our great abominations,
With our practices agree.
But by mercy he makes way.
To his fear; that, yet we may
Hear his voice, while it is, to day;
Whereunto, if we incline,
Maugre, then, all former sinnings,
Our late seasonable winnings,
Shall be pledges, and beginnings
Of a mercy more divine.
Oh, now therefore, let our praise
Be right-walkings, in his ways,
And, believing what he says:
Let our thankfulness be, still,
In true charity expressed;
In relieving men oppressed;
And, endeavoring our best,
In obedience, to his will.
Let us prudently forbear
To wax proud, or domineere,
When GOD, for us, does appear;
And, with awe express our joy:
Lest, if we presumptuous grow,
He may (for our doing so)
Turn his anger from our Foe;
Or, both him and us destroy.
We have seen the strong defeated;
By himself, the cheater cheated;
Men ambitious lower seated;
And, long-fixed Powers removed;
Nay, even such as we reputed
Things divinely constituted,
Are destroyed; and, they confuted,
Who, have them, for such, approved.
We have seen those things despised,
Which our Fathers highly prized,
And the whole earth Idolized;
Therefore, let us, now, for ever,
Constant be to that perfection,
Which deserves not rejection,
And, renounce our vain affection
To the ways of our deceiver.
Let those things, which GOD has done
For these Isles, be thought upon,
Not at such set times, alone,
As the Civil Powers command;
But; now let us; all our days,
Meditate his works, and ways,
And be mindful of his praise;
Whilst there shall be Sea, or Land.
And, Oh my eternal Lord!
Let thy al-subduing Sword,
But, that chiefly of thy Word,
Thus prevail, for evermore;
Make it still victorious grow,
Till to thee all Monarchs bow,
And, till vengeance thou shall throw
On the Dragon, and the Whore.
Well accept, this day, what we
Have in public offered thee;
And, this private Mite, from me,
Which I now presume to add:
For, in every Act of Grace,
Which by thee vouchsafed was,
Since my breathings in this place,
I, some special fruits have had.
In the many variations
Of thy works, and dispensations,
Unto these divided Nations,
I have learned to find out thee.
I, by them, thy mind discover,
And, I daily read thee over,
As my God, King, Father, Lover;
And, as all in all, to me.
I have found thee in their failings;
In their losings, and prevailings;
In their joys, and their bewailings;
In their hardness, and their blindness:
In their Trust, and their suspicions,
In their false, and true professions,
In their good, and bad conditions;
In their love, and their unkindnesse.
And, although this Generation,
Yet, beholds not what relation,
To their fall; or preservation,
My despised Poems have;
Some, ere long, will better heed them,
And (though few, now, think they need them)
Thou, wilt give them cause to read them,
When I shall be in my grave.
Oh! till then, let me persever,
My known duties to endeavor,
With true patience, howsoever
Thou shall exercise my Faith:
And, in every strong Temptation,
Trial, Straight, or Tribulation,
Mind me, for my Consolation,
What, thy truthfull Spirit says.
To what ever, thou shall call me,
Or, what ever may befall me,
Let no Terrene-Power appale me,
From declaring of thy Truth;
Let me, all my wits apply,
Thy great Name to magnify,
Whilst I live; and when I die,
Let thy praise be in my mouth.
And, when here I have completed,
That, for which I was created,
Let me thither be translated,
Where thy Saints, the Lamb attend;
That, I, may in praising him,
There communicate with them,
In that everlasting Hymn,
Which, will never have an end.
AMEN. HALELUJAH.
FINIS.
