THE REMONSTRANCE AND Complaints of the poor Commoners of ENGLAND WITH Their
humble addresses and Resolutions for a present relief therein.
SHOWING,
THat after the frequent pretenses, of a blessed Reformation; and the many
assurances of settling a wel-conditioned peace, in this now-unhappy Island; the
only issue of our six years late troubles and vast expenses, has been,
Religion wasted into a libertinisme of Factions; Three Kingdoms inflamed with
most bitter enmities; and this Nation consumed by the lamentable calamities of
an unnatural and bloody War.

That for more then twelve Months since, the Managery of the whole Power and
Authority of this Kingdom, has remained in the hands of a prevailing Party:
and the only end of this is, The confusion of a wel-temper'd Government, The
abandoning of wholesome Laws, and the purity of Justice troubled and overtopped
by an Arbitrary Jurisdiction over the lives and fortunes of a Freeborn people.

To this end Garrisons are still continued throughout the whole body of this
Kingdom; a Navy is kept at Sea, and an Army Free-quarter'd in every corner of
this Land; for the maintenance whereof, Gods patrimony is seized on: The
Free-holds of many thousands conscientious persons Sequestrated and exposed to
sale, and all of us surcharged with unsupportable impositions to secure our own
bondage.

All which notwithstanding, Distractions are still multiplied; the Public
debts increased daily; Mutinies and Insurrections continually suspected, and
almost numberless Families of innocence and worth, Crying to God for
vengeance; impoverished, and at present ready to perish for want.

Hereupon, Religion is scandalized, Husbandry is neglected, Commerce abandoned,
and Trades decayed; whereby the necessaries of our livelihood are grown scrace
and dear: Housekeeping is dis-abled, and all employments discontinued.

Insomuch, that besides the just provocations of Gods vengeance upon us, by the
crying sins of this Age, (which God has blinded to impenitency) blasphemy,
profaneness, Rebellion, hypocrisy, rapine, murder, cruelty, and all kinds
and degrees of uncharitableness: (the scene of our calamities being only
changed, and not withdrawn) We the poor Commoners, with this whole Nation,
(which can never be quieted, by the tyranny of a prevailing power) and clearly
behold a convincing evidence in the present state of these our distempers, that
(without some speedy remedy) they must necessarily be devoured by Famine or the
Sword, or live cowed and discontended, under the cruelty of a pretented
Conquest.

In prevention whereof it is their humble desire,
That all persons of public trust do immediately apply themselves to remove
the forementioned Grievances; and that every able man within our languishing
Dominions, (according to his power) do contribute his best assistance to
vindicate their respective rights and settle the peace of a distracted people.
And they do also further declare, that upon their backwardness therein, they
shall conceive themselves freed of all engagements for the public interests,
and (calling Heaven and earth in their behalf to attest their innocence in this
particular) will forthwith apply themselves to any Party, and to all
expediencies that may serve to secure them against the present dangers.
