WHereas I am informed that some evil disposed persons (upon pretense of
employment or authority from me, to hire and bring in Teams of Draught Horses
and Carts, for the service of the King and Parliament) have by color thereof
(extorsively and corruptly) taken and received Money from diverse of His
Majesty's Subjects, to release some Teams, and protect others from doing
Service; which has tended to the great prejudice of the parties so extorted
from, the hinderance of the public Service, and scandal (as much as in them
lay) of my Office, and the due execution thereof. I have thought fit hereby to
give public notice, That I shall take it for a favor of any man that will
inform me of the particular name or names, and offenses of any person or
persons that have been, or hereafter shall be offenders in this kind; And I
will readily contribute my best and utmost endeavors, not only to bring them
to condign punishment, but also to procure the parties wronged restitution of
their Moneys; with such other reparation, as to the wisdom of the Committee of
the Honorable House of Commons for Examinations shall be thought meet.

Dated at Plumbers-Hall, London, this 29. of May. 1643. Thomas Richardson
Wagon-Master General.
