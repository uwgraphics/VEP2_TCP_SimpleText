The Proceedings of the Assembly of Divines upon the Thirty nine Articles of
the Church of ENGLAND.
To the honorable house of COMMONS assembled in Parliament.
THe Assembly at their first sitting received an Order from both the honorable
Houses of Parliament, bearing date July 5. 1643, requiring them to take into
their consideration the ten first Articles of the 39 Articles of the Church of
England, to free and vindicate the Doctrine of them from all aspersions and
false interpretati^^^. In obedience whereunto, they forthwith took the said ten
first Articles into consideration. Afterward they received another Order for
the nine next following; and accordingly took the same into consideration. But
being limited by both the said Orders only to the clearing and vindicating of
them; though we found our selves necessitated for that end to make some, yet we
made fewer alterations in them and additions to them, then otherwise ^e (...)
^^ve thought fit to have done, if the whole m^tter h^d b^^n left to us without
such limitation, conceiving many things yet remaining to be defective, and
other expressions also fit to be changed. And herein we proceeded only to the
finishing of fifteen Articles, because it pleased both Houses by an Order
hearing date October. 12. 1643, to require us to lay aside the remainder, and
enter upon the work of Church Government: And afterward by another Order to
employ us in framing a Confession of Faith for the three Kingdoms, according to
the Solemn League and Covenant: In which Confession, we have not left out any
thing that was in the former Articles material* necessary to be retained. Which
having finished, and presented to both Houses, we should have forborne the
tendering of these fifteen Articles (both as a Piece several ways imperfect,
and the whole as relating only to the Church of England) but that we were
commanded otherwise by (...) order of the honorable House of Commons bearing
date Dec. 7. 1646. According whereunto, we prese^^ them (...) follows.

ARTICLE I. Of Faith in the holy Trinity.

ART. 2. Of the Word, or Son of God, which was made very Man.
The Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the
Father Prove. 8.22, to 31. Joh. 1.1, 2, 14.
, the very 1 John 5.^0. Romans 9.5.
and eternal God Joh. 17.5. Heb. 1.8. with Psalm. 45.6.
, of one substance with the Father Joh. 10.30. Heb. 1.3.
, took man's nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance Joh.
1.14. Isa. 7.14. Luke 1.35. Gal. 4.4.
. So that two whole and perfect natures, that is to say, the Godhead and the
Manhood, were joined together in one person, never to be divided, whereof is
one Christ very God and very Man Isa. 7.14. with Matthew. 1.23. Romans 1.3, 4. Heb.
13.8.
, who for our fakes truly suffered most grievous torments in his soul from God
Isa. 53.10, 11. Mark 14.33, 34.
, was crucified, dead, and buried 1 Pet. 2.24. Phil. 2 8. 1 Cor. 15.3, 4.
, to reconcile his Father to us Ezekiel. 16.63. Rom 3.25. 2 Cor. 5.19.
, and to be a Sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for all actual
sins of men Isa. 53.10. Ephesians. 5.2. 1 John 1.7. Heb. 9.26.
.

ART. 3.
As Christ died for us, and was buried; so it is to be believed, that he
continued in the state of the dead, and under the power and dominion of death
Psalm. 16.10. with Acts 2.24, 25, 26, 27, 31.
, from the time of his death and burial, until his resurrection Romans 6.9.
Matthew. 12.40.
: which has been otherwise expressed thus, He went down into Hell.

ART. 4. Of the Resurrection of Christ.
Christ did truly rise again from death 1 Cor. 15.4. Romans 8 34. Psalm. 16.10.
with Act. 2.31. Luke 24.34.
, and took again his body, with flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to
the perfection of man's nature Luke 24.39. with Joh. 20.25, 27.
, wherewith he ascended into heaven, and there fitteth Psalm. 68.18. with Ephesians.

1.11.
all men 2 Cor. 5.10. Act. 17.31.
at the general resurrection of the body at the last day Exodus 3.6. with Luke
20.37, 38. Act. 24.14, 15. 1 Cor. 15.12, to the end. Joh. 5.28, 29.
.

ART. 5. Of the holy Ghost.
The holy Ghost is very and eternal God, of one substance 2 Samuel 23.2. with
verse. 3. Isa 6.5, 8. with Acts 28.25. Acts 5.3, 4. 1 Cor. 3.16. 1 Cor. 6 19.
, majesty Job 26.13. Job 33.4. 1 Cor. 12 chap. Matthew 28.19. 2 Cor. 13.14.
, and glory with the Father and the Son 1 Cor. 12.11. Ephesians. 1.17, and 1 Cor.
2.8. with 1 Pet. 4.14.
, proceeding from the Father and the Son Joh. 15.26. Matthew. 10.20, and 1 Cor.
2.11, 12. with Gal. 4.6, and Romans 8.9, and Phil. 1.19* Joh. 16.14. Isai. 11.2.
Isai. 61.1. Genesis 1.2. 2 Chronicles. 15.1.
.

ART. 6. Of the sufficiency of the holy Scriptures for salvation.
Holy Scripture Romans 1.2. 2 Timothy 3.15. 2 Pet. 1.20, 21.
contains all things necessary to salvation Psalm. 19.7. 2 Timothy 3.15, 16, 17
Jam. 1.21, 25. Act. 20.32.
; so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to
be believed as an Article of Faith, or necessary to salvation Prove. 30.5, 6.
Isai. 8.20. Act. 26.22. with verse. 20, 27. Gal. 1.8, 9. Joh. 5.39.
.

By the name of holy Scripture, we understand all the Canonical Books of the
Old and New Testament; which follow.

Of the Old Testament, Genesis, Exodus, etc. Of the New Testament, Matthew,
etc.
All which Books, as they are commonly received, we do receive, and acknowledge
them to be given by the inspiration of God, and in that regard to be of most
certain credit, and highest authority.

ART. 7. Of the Old Testament.
The Old Testament is not contrary to the New, in the doctrine contained in
them Acts 26.22, 23. 2 Pet. 3.2. Luke 24.44. Romans 3.31. Gal. 3.21, 23, 24.
; for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is offered to mankind
by Christ Genesis 3.15. Genesis 22.18. with Gal. 3.8, 14. 1 Cor. 10.2, 3, 4. Luke
1.69, 70. Acts 3.24. Isai. 53 chap.
, who is the only Mediator between God and man Dan 9.17. Romans 8.34. 1 John
2.1. Heb. 7.25. 1 Timothy 2.5. Joh. 14.6.
, being both God and Man Gal. 4.4.5. Acts 20.28. Phil 2 7, 8.
. Wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign, that the old fathers did
look only for temporary promises Acts 26 6, 7. Romans 4.11. Gal. 3.9. Heb.
11.10, 16, 35*
.

Although the Law given from God by Moses, a^ touching Ceremonies and Rites, do
not bind Christians Gal. 4.9, 10* Col. 2.14, 16, 17. Heb. 9.9, 10.
, nor the Civil precepts given by Moses, such as were peculiarly fitted to the
Commonwealth of the Jews, are of necessity to be received in any Commonwealth
Acts 29.9, 10, 25. with Deuteronomy. 17.8, to 13. Romans 13.1, 5. Tit. 3.1. 1 Pet. 2.13,
14.
: yet notwithstanding no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of
the Commandments which are called Moral Matthew* 5.17, to the end. Romans 13.8, 9,
10. Ephesians. 6.1, 2, 3. Jam. 2.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Romans 7.25: Romans 3.31. Matthew.
7.12.
. By the Moral Law we understand all the ten Commandments taken in their full
extent.

ART. 8. Of the three Creeds.
The Creeds that go under the names of the Nicene Creed, Atha^asius Creed, and
that which is commonly called The Apostles Creed, are thoroughly to be received
and believed, for that they may be proved by most certain warrant of holy
Scripture.

ART. 9. Of Original, or Birth-sin.
Original sin Psalm. 51.5. Joh. 3* 5, 6.
stands not in the following of Adam, as the Pelagians do vainly talk Job
14.4. Job. 15.14. Romans 6.6* Joh. 3.3, 5.7.
* But, together with his first sin imputed Rom* 5.12, to 19. 1 Genesis 2.17. with
1 Cor. 15.22.
, it is the fault and corruption of the nature of every man, that naturally is
propagated from Adam; whereby man is wholly deprived of Original righteousness
Col. 2.13. Romans 7.18. Eccles. 7.29.
, and is of his own nature inclined only to evil Genesis 6.5. Genesis 8.21. Jer.
17.9. Romans 7.8. Jam* 1.14.
. So that the lust of the flesh, called in Greek (...), which some do expound
the Wisdom, some Sensuality, some the Affection, some the Desire of the flesh,
is not subject to the Law of God Romans 8.7. 1 Cor. 2.14. Col. 1.27.
, and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserves Gods wrath
and damnation Ephesians. 2.3. Romans 8.6.
. And this infection of nature does remain, yea in them that are regenerate
Prove. 20.9. Romans 7.17, 20, 23, 25.4.
, whereby the flesh lusts always contrary to the Spirit Gal. 5.17.
. And although there is no condemnation for them that are regenerate and do
believe Romans 8.1, 13. ^oh. 3.18.
; yet the Apostle does confess that concupiscence and lust is truly and
properly sin Romans 7.17.20.
.

ART. 10. Of Free Will.
The condition of man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turn or
prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith and
calling upon God Ephesians. 2.1, 5. 1 Cor. 2.14. Ephesians. 2.8, 9, 10. Joh. 6.44, 65.
; wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasing and acceptable to God
Romans 8.8. Heb. 11.6.
, without the grace of God by Christ, both preventing us, that we may have a
good Will, and working so effectually in us, as that it determines our Will to
that which is good Ezekiel. 11.19, 20. Ez^k. 36.26, 27. Jer. 31.32, 33. with Heb.
8.10, 11. Phil. 2.12, 13. Joh. 6.45. Ephesians. 1.19, 20. 1 Cor. 4.7.
, and also working with us when we have that will unto good Heb. 13.21. Phil.
1.6. Heb. 12.2. 1 Pet. 5.10. 1 Thessalonians. 5.23, 24. 1 Kings 8.57, 58.
.

ART. II. Of the Justification of man before God.
We are justified, that is, we are accounted righteous before God, and have
remission of sins Romans 4.5, 6, 7 Psalm. 32.1, 2.
, not for nor by our own works or deservings Romans 3.20. Gal. 2.16. Gal. 3.10,
11. Phil. 3.9.
, but freely by his grace Romans 3.24. Tit. 3.7.
, only for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ's sake Romans 3.24, 25. Romans 5.1. 2
Cor. 5.18, 19.
, his whole obedience and satisfaction being by God imputed unto us Romans 5.9,
17, 18, 19. Romans 3.25, 26. Romans 4.6, 24. 2 Cor. 5.21.
, and Christ with his righteousness, being apprehended and rested on by faith
only Romans 3.22, 25, 26, 28. Gal. 2.16. Isa. 28.16. with Romans 9.33. and 1 Pet.
2.6. Phil. 3.9.
. The Doctrine of Justification by Faith only, is an wholesome Doctrine, and
very full of comfort 2 Timothy 1.13. Romans 5.1, 2, ^, 11. Romans 15.13. 1 Pet. 1.8.
: notwithstanding God does not forgive them that are impenitent, and go on
still in their trespasses Psalm. 68.20, 21. Exodus 34.6, 7. Luke 13.3, 5.
.

ART. 12. Of good works.
Good works, which are the Fruits of Faith Gal 5.6. Jam. 2.17, 18, 22.
, and follow after Justification Tit. 2.14. Tit. 3.7, 8. Ephesians. 2.8, 9, 10.
, cannot put away our sins Romans 3.20, 21. Romans 4.4, to 9. Dan. 9.18, 19.
, and endure the severity of Gods Judgment; yet are they, notwithstanding
their imperfections Exodus 28.38. Rev. 8.3, 4.
, in the sight of God pleasing and acceptable unto him in and for Christ 1 Pet.
2.5. Heb. 13.16, 20, 21. Col. 1.10. Phil. 4.18.
, and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith Jam. 2.26. 1 John
1.4.
, insomuch that by them a lively Faith may be evidently known, Neh. 13.22.
Psalm. 143.2. Job 9.14, 15, 19, 20.
as a tree discerned by the fruits Jam. 2.18, 22. Joh. 15.4, 5. 1 John 2.3, 5.
Matthew. 12.33.
.

ART. 13. Of Works before Justification.
Works done before Justification by Christ, and Regeneration by his Spirit, are
not pleasing unto God Tit. 1.15, 16. Matthew. 7.1^. Romans 8.8. Prove. 15.8, 26.
Prove. 21.27. Romans 3.12.
, forasmuch as they spring not of Faith in Jesus Christ Heb. 11.5, 6. Gal. 5.6.
; neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the School-Authours
say) deserve grace of congruity ^ Tim. 1.9. Joh. 1.13.
; yea rather, for that they are not done as God has willed and commanded them
to be done, they are sinful Romans 8.7, 8. Hag. 2.14. Isa. 58.1, to 5. Isa. 66.2,
3.
.

ART. 14. Of Works of Supererogation.
Voluntary Works besides, over and above Gods Commandments, which they call
Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught Matthew. 5.48. Mar. 12.30, 31. Phil.
4.8, 9.
without arrogance and impiety Job 9.2, 3, 20, 21. Psalm. 143.2. Prove. 20.9.
Phil. 3.8, 10 15.
: for by them men do declare that they do not only render unto God as much as
they are bound to do; but that they do more for his sake then of bounden duty
is required: whereas Christ says plainly, When you have done all those things
that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants, we have done that
which was our duty to do Luke 19.10. with verse. 7, 8, 9.
.

ART. 15. Of Christ alone without sin.
Christ in the truth of our nature, was made like unto us in all things, sin
only excepted Isa. 53 3, 4, 5. Heb. 2.17. with Heb. 4.15.
, from which he was clearly void both in his flesh and in his spirit Luke 1.35.
with Act. 3.14. Joh. 14.30. 2 Cor. 5.21. Heb. 7.26.
: he came to be the Lamb without spot 1 Pet. 1.19.
, who by sacrifice of himself Ephesians. 5.2.
once made Heb. 9.26, 28. Heb. 10.10, 12
, should take away the sins of the world Joh. 1.29.
; and sin (as Saint John says) was not in him 1 John 3.5.
. But all we the rest, although baptized and regenerate, yet offend in many
things; and if we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is
not in us Jam. 3.2. 1 John 1.8, 10.
.
