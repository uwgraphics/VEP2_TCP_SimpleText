A SHORT HISTORICAL ACCOUNT, Concerning the Succession to the Crown of
SCOTLAND: And the Estates disposing of it upon Occasion as they thought fit.
When Fergus the first was chosen King the Estates gave the Crown to him his
Heirs and Successors, and confirmed it by an Oath.

Fergus being deceased, leaving two Sons Ferleg, and Main, who being but young
were not for Governing; and the Estates being conveened, choosed a King: And
there being great contest among them, it was objected by one party, that the
Crown having been given to Fergus and his Heirs, and the Estates having
confirmed it by an Oath, they could not pass by his Son and choose another
King; and on the other hand it was pleaded, that the Estates should consider
that there were great dangers both at home and abroad if they should admit a
Chind to be King. And after being debated they came to this Resolution; that
notwithstanding their Oath given to Fergus, yet when their King dies, leaving
Children, who in respect of their age are not fit for Governing, that the next
of the Line who is fittest to Govern should be King; and that after his decease
the Crown should return to the former King's Children; upon which, Feritharis,
Pergus his Brother was chosen King, and this Law continued for the space of one
thousand years, from Feritharis his time, to Kenneth the Third, who (as the
historian says) by force and fraud, obtained this Law to be changed.

Ferleg, Fergus his eldest Son, when he came to age, being ambitious to Reign
entered into a conspiracy against Feritharis, which being discovered, he was
taken and imprisoned, but escaped with some of his accomplices, and few Months
after Feritharis having died, it was thought he got wrong by Ferleg, and
therefore upon the presumptions of Ferleg his former ambition, and conspiracy,
and sudden slight, Ferleg, by unanimous consent of the Estates, was condemned
and deprived of the Right and Succession to the Crown, and Main his Brother was
made King.

Albeit by the Law made in Fergus the first's time, the Estates granted the
Crown to the King and his Heirs, which was confirmed by Oath, yet when the
Estates found it not for the interest of the Nation, that the Crown should
descend upon the Kings Children, and immediate Heirs, They conferred it upon
another of the same Line, as in the case of the two Sons of Durstus who
albeit they were of age fit for Governing when their Father died, yet the
Estates considering, that if they should admit any of Durstus his Children to
the Crown, (who had been a wicked King and had forced his Subjects to a
conspiracy against him) the likeness of manners might make them continue in
their Fathers wickedness, and the neereness of Blood incite them to revenge:
Therefore they passed by Durstus his two sons, and choosed Evven Durstus his
Cusine German to be King.

In Ferchard his Reign, the Estates conveened by their own authority, and
having cited the King to appear before them, he refused to appear, and having
retired to a strong castle, the Estates did take him out, and brought him
before them, and having accused him of many heinous Crimes, and particularly
that he was guilty of the pelagian Heresy, and contempt of the Sacrament of
Baptism, and other holy Rites; and he not being able to clear himself of the
Crimes, with which he was charged, was put in Prison and shortly after died.

King Robert Bruce when he was first settled upon the Throne having only a
Daughter who by the Law should have succeeded, there was a new Law made, that
if the King should die without Male Children, his Brother Edward and his Sons
should succeed; and if he should die without Children, that then King Robert's
Daughter and her Heirs should succeed to the Crown: But it was provided that
the Estates should choose a Husband for her, that was most fit to govern, for
they thought it was much more reasonable that they should choose their King,
than that the Queen should choose her Husband. And there after the King having
a Son, and another Daughter, the entail was again altered, and the Crown was
provided to King Robert and his Children: and they failing to Robert Stevvart
the Kings Grandchild, by his eldest Daughter, passing by his two Daughters,
Which settlement the Estates did confirm by Oath: And yet that notwithstanding
David the second, King Robert's Son, did alter this Law and Settlement, and
made a new Law, excluding Robert Stevvart, and substituting Alexander, Son to
the Earl of Sutherland, by King Robert's second Daughter, which the Estates
did likeways confirm by Oath, but Alexander having died shortly after, and King
David being reconciled to Robert Stevvart, he was by Act of Parliament restored
to his own place in the Succession.

The said Robert, who was the first King of the Race of Stewart, being first
married to the Earl of Ross his Daughter, by whom he had two Sons, and a
Daughter, did after the Queen's decease, marry Elizabeth Muir with whom he had
begotten three Sons before his marriage with the Earl of Ross his Daughter.
And albeit the former course of Succession was not only established by Law, but
confirmed by Oath; Yet the Estates did again alter it and entailed the Crown
upon Elizabeth Muire^s Children, passing by the Children of the first Marriage,
who were for ever excluded; and Robert the third who was the eldest Son by
Elizabeth Muir succeeded to the Crown, of whom King James the seventh is
lineally Descended.

From all which these things may be evidently inferred.

1. That by the constitution of the Government of this Kingdom there was an
original Contract betwixt the King and the People by which their Kings were
oblidged to Rule by Law.

2. That when the Kings made Invasion upon Religion and the Law and Liberties
of the Subject, tending to the subversion of the Government, the Estates did
conveen by their own Authority and called their Kings in question for it.

3. That the Estats have been in use to alter the course of Succession, when
they did see it for the Interest and Well of the Kingdom; and did entail the
Crown to others than those who by former Laws had Right to succeed, keeping
always the same Family.

4. It is by virtue of such an entail and settlement of the Crown that King
James the seventh, and his Predecessors succeeded to the Crown, ever since
King Robert the third.

5. That when the Estates, conferred the Crown upon any Person or Family,
albeit they confirmed it by Oath and swore Allegiance to the King his Heirs
and Successors, yet when their Kings broke the Original Contract with the
People, and upon that ground the Estates did think fit to lay aside any of
their Kings, or did alter the course of Succession, they thought themselves no
longer tied by their former Oath of Allegiance, but loosed therefrom and swore
Allegiance to their new King, which ^as not only been the practice of this
Kingdom, but is, and has been the practice of England, and other Nations, on
the like occasions.
