A Testimony against JOHN, FENWICK, concerning his Proceeding about NEW-CESARIA
or NEW JERSEY in the Province of AMERICA.
Reader,
WHoever thou art that read^st this following Paper of John Fenwick, may
understand, that he has unadvisedly, and without the true Fear of God,
projected and undertaken great Worldly Matters and Designs (in Part of America,
at a Place called New-Caesaria or New Jersey, without Clear, Just, Honest
Ground or Foundation (especially, until that Tract of Land were amongst the
Proprietors divided, and purchased of the Indians) either as a Man, or as a
Christian: And by his printed Paper bearing date the 8th of the 1st Month,
1674. did draw forth the Minds of many, most of which, like himself, longed for
outward Ease and Plenty, and grasped at outward Honor and Riches, and
overlooked the True Honor which is of God and Godliness, through the
deceivable Working of the Enemy in him and them, etc. whereby, as he himself
says, The Name of God has been blasphemed, and his Spirit grieved. Now he
being reputed or called a Quaker, we in Conscience to God, and to clear the
Truth and our selves, and in Good Will to others, that none might be carried
away with Airy Conceptions, did in a Godly Jealousy bear Witness against his
Undertakings and Proceedings, as inconsistent with the Truth and Christianity:
And after he came to some Sight and Sense of the same, he wrote this following
Paper with his own Hand, and sent it to us as a Testimony against himself and
Proceedings, which we expected he would not only confess, but also forsake, and
cease farther to prosecute those Things, which brought forth such bad Effects
mentioned in the said Paper; But instead thereof he resolutely perseveres in
the same, the Consequence whereof, we fear, will prove destructive to himself
and Followers.

Now because it is bruited and famed abroad, that we as a People, have Advised,
Councelled and Approved of the Manner of his Undertakings, we for the
Information of all People, and Clearing of the Truth and our selves, do hereby
signify; we have no Part nor Lot in these his Proceedings; neither did we in
particular, or as a People, ever Approve, Countenance or Encourage the same,
but judged the Issue would prove Evil and Confused, like as the Beginning: So
to manifest and approve our selves in Deed and in Truth what we profess in
Words, and true Subjects to the Royal Law, Doing to others (though Heathen) as
we would have others do to us; and Disowning, Judging, and Condemning Deceit,
Hypocrisy and Evil-Doing among any pretending to be one with us, as among
others: And to clear the Truth and our selves, we make this public, and not to
wrong any Man's particular Interest or Propriety; but that every Man's Building
may stand upon his own Foundation, and every Project and Device be fathered
upon its own Inventor.

London the 6th Day of the 5th Month comm^nly called July Anno Domini, 1675.
From the People of God, called Quakers, in London.
JOHN FENWICK's Letter of Condemnation sent to FRIENDS, upon their Testifying
Against his Proceedings.
My Dear Friends,
OUr God is a Consuming Fire of all that is Contrary to him; and they, and
every one that names his sacred Name, must depart from Iniquity, and give
Honor, Glory, and Praise and Thanks unto him for evermore.

O! Woe is me; it is I that have Sinned Against Him: For, his sacred Name has
for a certain been Blasphemed through me, his Spirit grieved in me, and in you
his People also through me; having not stood steadfast in the Faith of our Lord
Jesus Christ; but have consented to, and gone along with the Thief and Robber,
the Devil, that Enemy to God and Man, who never cease laboring to rob God of
his Honor, and steals away the Soul of Men from the Lord and his True Peace,
as he has done by my poor Soul: Finding it careless, and off from its Watch,
and in the multitude of Worldly Business, hurrying it away from the precious
Faith of God's chosen Seed, Christ Jesus our Lord, in which it should have been
found fighting and laying hold of Eternal Life; So in his Subtilty he has
overtaken me, surprised me, and by hi^ Evil Counsel made me to grasp at Outward
Honors and Riches and therein to overlook the True Honor; which is of God and
Godliness, which is Riches indeed, which indeed my Soul thirsts after: But the
Enemy blinded my Eyes, and deceived me, by thinking, that a Desire only of
Knowing the Lord, and of Serving the Lord, and of desiring Upright and Honest
Things, and only in aiming to effect them, in the obetaining the Outward Honor
and Riches, wherewith he then alured me, and drew me into his Snares, would be
a sufficient Ground to engage not only all my outward Parts, Wisdom and
Knowledge to bring about my Designs therein; but also in the Defense thereof,
not only to Strive with Men therein, but Fight Against even God, his Truth and
People, if they interposed therein. And thus, together with many other his
Wiles, Subtilties and cunning Craftiness, wherewith he lies in wait to deceive
the Simple in Heart, has he deceived my Soul, in thrawled, wounded and robbed
my Soul of its Peace and Rest; this has been, and still is the Grief, Sorrow
and Burden of my Soul: And had not the Lord God of our Mercies beheld me in
Pity, and for his own Name's sake showed me the Evil of my Ways, and led me
by the Hand of his Love, shed abroad in your Hearts, to seek how to bring me
back to his Fold; and how to help and Comfort my Soul, and to lift my Feet out
of the Mire and Clay, my Soul had certainly perished, and become as Sodom, and
like unto Gomorrah: All Honor, Glory, Praises and Thanks be given unto our God
for evermore; and let my-Soul forever Praise his holy Name. For, I can say, in
the Sense of the tender Love and rich Mercies of the Lord our God, O the
Deepness of the Riches both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God! How
incomprehensible are his Judgments, and his Ways unsearchable, and past
finding out! To him be Praises and Dominion forever and forever: To whom I
look, and from whom I expect Sal^ation alone, and that for his own Name's sake.
And my Soul thirsts after, and dearly longs to enjoy his Peace, with the Unity
of you his People in all my future Undertakings.

This given by his Own Hand to Friends, in the 3d Month, called May, 1675.
John Fenwick.
