The Welchmans Declaration: DECLARING Her Resolution to pe revenged on her
enemies, for te ^reat overthrow of a creat many of her Cousins and Countrymen
in Teane Forest in Clocestershire, where her was most cruelly peaten: together
with her Complaint for the loss of Ragland Castle pelonging to her creat
Cousin (the Earl of Worcester) while her was keep it, but now taken from her by
her teadly enemy Sir William Waller, who was peat her in the foresaid Forest,
in the climactericall year of her unhappy Testruction. 1642.



The Welchmans Resolution, to revenge her self upon her enemies, for the teath
of her Contrymen in the creat overthrow given her by Sir WILLIAM WALLER, her
teadly enemy.
HEr was thought to have showed creat valor, and done extraordinary feats
against her enemies, if her hand put te wit to describe tem, put her was so
weak in ammunition and strength, tat her could do nothing, to her creat
tiscouragement and tisadvantage, py reason Morgan ap Griffith her venerable
Captain lost her life and arms in te combat, yet let her without fanity or
ostentation speak truth, which her seldom can do, her countrymen in tat
bickering pehaved temselves like old Prittains, and fought it out pravely, and
no doubt had her had put means to have escaped with her foul and pody
conjunctly joined, her had achieved a creat overthrow worth remembrance in her
yearly Prognostication, put it was to no purpose to fight without her head, her
enemies played te men pravely, and made her cry peccavi, and instead of
fighting, safe her self with her heels, cots plut, it was petter to live in
hopes to do future service, ten upon te first skirmish to lose her life, or pe
taken and made to dance parefoot after he enemies music, to some goal of
bondage, where her must pe kept to give an account of her treason and rebellion
against her country: but ferily her thought py her valor under pretense of
fighting for her knows not what, to win to her self immortal infamy, and
creat wealth, peeing weary of her Welsh Country, and in hopes to live on te
fertile and smooth English soil, which still her endeavor shall be to effect.

And now loving contrymen and prethren in iniquity, let us pee advising what
way her was pest do her self good, and revenge te teath of her creat cousin and
contrymen, and pring to pass tese creat things, her will propound to her
crave considerations tese particulars.

1 Inprimis, her was pest to return into her own country, and rest her self
till her has recovered her self, and re-furnished her self with some of her
country pacon, sheese, putter, leek, and te like provision for her natural
relief in her next journey, for her was in fear pefore her can again set
forth her self to do her country service, te pelly-timber and prog, which her
most aims at, will pe consumed and devoured by her enemies, and if her happen
to pe again peaten, her may pe strong to run away into te Woods and Mountains,
where her is sure her adversaries cannot easily pursue her, nor get any thing
from her to relieve teir wants in teir pursuit.

Secondly her was conceited, when her was again employed in service against her
foes, to co put to te border of her own Country, and nor to adventure her self
too far in te Enemies Country and Territories, for fear that her should meet
with her Countryman death and so her should never return again to make her
will, and bequeath her coods left pehind her, to her Wife, Shildren, and
Couzins, pi which means tey may pe teprived of them, py her covetous and
teevish Countrymen and neigpours, which was wounding to her after her teath,
Cot bless her from a Cun, te ferry name of teath kills her pefore her is ready
to dye, put her has petter hopes, tat her shall never come where her must fight
in earnest, for her could never apide to hear the roaring of the Cuns, neither
could her ever endure such pultty doings in all her life.

Tirdly, Her was intended pefore her set forth again, pi an humble Petition to
her next Captain Genarall to know te true reason wherefore her must fight, and
for what her must venture her tear plud, for it was not yet manifest to her mind
for what her did fight, which made her fight with no fery creat courage, and if
it shall appear to her sense tat te cause is good, for te tefence of her
unknown Welsh Laws, for te ma^^^enance of te tignity of te reverend Pishites
and Prelates of Englant, and her own Country of Wales; whereby her Religion may
pe maintained in te outward magnificence, yet were it for her ease or
preferment, her would not stick to entertain any Religion whatsoever, for her
do ferrily pelieve most of her Countrymen may yet choose teir Religion without
much danger to teir souls, put if te new should pe worse ten te old, her would
spend her plud in tefending tat her has hitherto learned and professed.

Fourthly, Her was thought requisite, that if her should happen to be compelled
again to fight, it should be upon creat odds and advantages, observing te
valorous deeds, and heroic exploits achieved and performed pi tat trice Noble
Warrior Prince Rupert, te only enemy to te English Nation, that then when the
Forces of our adversaries pe creater ten ours, not to fight at all, but put the
Skirmish off with subtle slights and devices, and magnanimous Bravadoes, and
turn her Force to plunder and spoil te Country, where little or no resistance
can be made, furnish her self, and victual her Camp, pi robbery and rapine,
and make te night serve her, pi purning te hay and corn of te Country, making
lights thereof to run away pi unpursued; put if her perceive her self strong
enough or rather too strong for her foes, ten fall upon them with creat fury
and violence, let not one escape, kill her and slay her every one, and cause
her valor to pe chronicled, for te perpetual fame of her creat and haughty
deeds of Chivalry, spread her renown with all speed about her Country, tat her
self for her part in one pattle, killed hundreds, and took from ten their
Arms, Money, and Clothes, some whereof, as Ensigns of her Honor, her must
send to her friends and Cousins of her own plud in her own Country, thereby to
encourage tem to undertake her cause, and help her to go forward in her prave
victories.

Fifthly, If her can work pi secreat plots with any of her friends in her
Enemies Army, which are there put for an advantage to her upon occasion, to let
her know te true strength of their Forces, how many of them are inclined to
turn in Skirmish to her fide, what store of Ammunition, Powter, Pullets,
Ordnance, te fery name whereof has almost killed her, they are furnished withal
twill pe a cood policy to prevent her own damage, preserve her safety, and
encourage, or discourage her to fight, according to such information, and pi
which her may pe te petter forewarned to runn away, if her find cood occasion.

And tus much of her present metitations which was come into her mind, and her
thought cood to present to your crave senses and consultations, which her
tesire may pe weighed, and if approved, put in execution, pefore her Enemies
has notice of her resolutions, and prevent te same pi their sudden rising
against her in her own Country, her had thought to have given her mind touching
the security of her Country, her means seizing to te cood of her homebred
Foes, and taking away tere Arms, pi which tey may be disabled to hurt her at
her setting forth again, put now her has no time to recapitulate te same,
pecause her perceives her Enemies are at her heels, and her must leave te
discourse till her may get safe into her Country, at which time, her will call
to mind her disgrace, received from time to time, pi her cruel foes, and
metitate how her may with the assistance of her vallourous and courragious
Countrymen, revenge that, and all other her past received Injuries, and tefend
te Laws, and te Religion of her Country, and her Liperies untermined pi het
Adversaries.

FINIS.
