CONCERNING TITHES.
TITHES AT first were not required, but given, only of the spoils of the
War, (only once,) by Abraham, unto him that was made like unto the Son, but
the substance being now come, (even Christ) who was before the Wars, and
before Abraham, he redeemes out of the lust from whence the Wars arises, and
so brings to an end of that from whence Wars comes, and so to an end of
that from whence Tithes were first given; and so to give nor pay Tithes no
longer; being redeemed out of lust, and Wars, and fightings, by the blood of
Jesus who said I am the light, that abides a Priest for ever, and his day
Abraham rejoiced to see, who brings to the end of the Tithes, and makes War
with that, and slayes that, which caused Men to slay one another, in the
Wars, who comes to save the life, who is greater then Abraham, who being now
come; denies fighting, and says he that takes the Sword shall perish with
the Sword, and so that was to perish whereby Tithes were first given, then must
there needs be an end of Tithes, which also perishes with the using, and the
Law for the Tithes (which had a shadow of good things to come) decays, and
waxes old, and vanishes away, the good things themselves being come, and good
will toward Man, and the Covenant of Light to join the hearts together.

For Tithes were never given nor paid until after Men had killed, and slain,
and done violence and wrong one to another, and Christ says love your enemies,
and if he smite thee on the one cheek turn the other, and such as are come to
that, and obeyes his command, are come out of the Wars, and the strife, unto
the Prince of peace, who was before the Wars, and so knows the peaceable
Covenant, which will not wax old, but last for ever, in which there is no
Wars, nor killing one another, and so comes to the end of that Covenant which
commanded the Tithes, and to the change of the Law, the Priest whereof and they
that receive the Tithes, murdered and slew him that is to bring to the end of
the Tithes, so that by him to the end they are not come, nor from under the
first Covenant, where the Tithes is paid whilst the veil is over the heart,
and that ministry standing which makes nothing perfect, and will dye, and
change, and perish: but he that redeemes out of, and from among them, and that,
which perishes, abides a Priest for ever; and of him it is said he lives: and
so him we bear testimony of, who is entered within the veil in whom the veil
is done away, and so that is seen, and departed from, and made an end of, which
stood whilst the veil was not rent, and the way into a more holy known, then
the first Covenant where the Tithes were paid, the veil being over the heart,
and is yet over the hearts of all them, who pay or receive Tithes, and all that
uphold it, who may take notice that the first Priests that ever took Tithes
and offerings by force, were Sons of Beliall and know not God, whom the Lord
destroyed, and they perished in the Wars, with the Sword, 1 Samuel 2. 12. verse.
16.

Therefore we cannot but deny Tithes, and the upholding of it, and all such as
take it (especially) by force, which actions are the fruits of such Priests as
know not God, and such he will overturn.

For the seed of God in many thousands, cries unto him, by reason of the cruel
oppression of Tithes, from under which the Lord will deliver us.
