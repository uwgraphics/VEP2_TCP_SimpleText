From the Commissioners of Scotland, 24 February, 1640.
AS our Declarations and Remonstrances before our coming into England, were
necessary for manifesting the Truth against the Lies, and Calumnies of our
Enemies, so did We conceive, that afterward they should not be needful. Our
deportments, and carriage in this great cause, which are no other in secret,
then they are openly, being real demonstrations of the constant integrity of
our Intentions, and proceedings, in all our ways.

Malice, notwithstanding, is so impudent, and indefatigable, that although She
has printed on Her face the black characters of many gross lies, which are
visible to all, and cannot be washed of, and although by the force of Truth,
the Daughter of Time, She has received many wounds and dashes, which shall
never be cured, yet dare She open her mouth again, and wearieth not to keep
Her own strain, but in a contrary course: for now begins She to suggest,
that after We have in a good part obtained our own ends: We have lessened our
care of our Neighbors, And that our love toward them is become lukewarm,
that We are become remiss in our zeal against Prelacie, the cause of all our
broyls, and in the pursuit of these two firebrands, which had wasted all, if
God in his mercy had not prevented so great a mischief.

We marvel not at Malice, nor do We desire to be reconciled to her, for that
were to lose our selves, and the Cause of God, And therefore We think it not
strange that she is the same, which she has been, and must be to the end:
But that by her suggestions, and practices, tending, by raising of jealousies
and suspicions, to divide the two Kingdoms, the two Houses of Parliament, and
either House in it self, she should so far prevail with any, who have not
laid aside both wisdom and charity, as that the smallest jealousy or
suspicion of us should enter in their heart (for them to live and lodge, we
will not permit.) This is it which has caused this Paper.

What just cause of indignation We had against these two incendiaries is known
by our Accusations, which (as We understand) are now published to the World,
and by these also, beside our detestation expressed in all our Words, Writs,
and Actions; Our judgment and intentions concerning Episcopacy both in Scotland
and England, are in some measure expressed. We confess it were levity, to be
found building that which We have been pulling down, or to plant that which
We have been plucking up. It were impiety to spare much more to plead for
guilty Agag, and cursed Babell, which God in his justice has destinate to
destruction: And it were folly for us, and a denying of our own experience, to
imagine that both they, and the Kingdoms can have peace; but all these three
imputations might be justly tripled upon us, if now after We have seen their
works, and bitter fruits in England, We should not remember the Maxim never
to be forgotten, The safety of the People is the sovereign Law, and that Mercy
to the bad is cruelty against the good.

And therefore, We desire that your Lordships would be pleased to represent so
much from us to the Parliament, and with all, that for the present, according
to the Commission given to us, We do long to see Justice done upon the
Lieutenant of Ireland, earnestly craving according to the famous and laudable
custom of that grave and honorable Counsel, He may bear the punishment,
which the atrocity of his Crimes do deserve, Which should be much for his
Majesty's honor, and for the peace of all his Majesty's good Subjects, who
will be out of hope of the redress of their grievances, if the wicked, who
have caused all their woes, be either justified, or spared. Better that One
perish then Unity.
