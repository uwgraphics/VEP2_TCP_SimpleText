THE PROTESTATION Of the Gentry, Ministers, Freeholders, and other Inhabitants
of the County of York against a Petition drawn up in the name of that County,
Bearing date the third of June, 1642.
WHereas there is a printed Petition (entitled, To the right Honorable the
Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the Gentry,
Ministers, Freeholders, and other substantial Inhabitants of this County of
York) spread abroad in the County, which we conceive to be a great wrong and
scandal to all well-affected persons, not only in respect of the matter
thereof which we utterly dislike, as laying an imputation upon ^he Parliament,
in not giving life to the Laws of the Land, and likewise in charging them to
be the cause of the distractions of this Kingdom: But also, that it was never
presented to the Country at the general meeting the 3. of June, albeit it was
printed the next day, and since read in diverse Churches; We whose names as
here subscribed, do hereby make our Protestation against the said Petition, as
no way ever approved on by us, or agreeing with our sense. And we do hereby
further declare, that we shall (according to our Protestation lately taken by
us) with our lives and fortunes defend his Majesty's Royal Person, Honor and
Estate, and also the power and privilege of Parliament, together with the
rights and liberties of the Subjects; of which Rights and Liberties we conceive
the Privileges of Parliament to be the chief.
