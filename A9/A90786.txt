To the High and Honorable Assembly of PARLIAMENT, representing the whole body
of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, etc.
Lords, and Gentlemen,
HAving seen that Policy, and Religion, which (as God is) ought to be
universal was divided and severed into many Sects, my spirit was much
troubled; and looking round-about me, where to make a beginning to rectify
those evils, I found no better object in Christendom, then his late Highness
the Lord PROTECTOR; whereupon I resolved for a while, to leave my family and
native Country, fearing if I should not manifest to the Magistrates in England,
what was upon my spirit, that they (having much to do with other affairs)
might through the subtilty of the Clergy, (as in other Nations) easily be
deceived. Therefore coming to London, I made first my address to some of the
Counsel, and so (by the favor of them) to his Highness were I delivering the
two following Letters, was heard several times with patience; doing my
endeavor to preserve England from that great dishonor which has befallen
other Nations, by setting up instead of the form, and doctrine of Christ, the
forms and factions of men. But being obstructed in my proceeding, through the
unexpected death of his Highness, I was put to some stop, waiting for a better
opportunity, and hearing, that your Honors were to assemble together upon the
27. of January, my spirit was revived, hoping that my design (for the peace,
and welfare of these Nations) by that means (better then heretofore) might be
accomplished. Whereupon I resolved to bring the business (formerly propounded
to his Highness) to your Honors Consideration, being persuaded in my heart, if
You (who are now entrusted with the weighty affairs of these Nations) have
fixed your eyes upon God, as the eyes of the good people in these and other
Nations are fixed upon You, that the Proposals laid down in the two following
Letters, will have a great influence upon your hearts; especially if you
consider and remember the notable words of Solomon, where he speaks to the
Kings and Rulers of the earth, that a sharp judgment shall come upon them that
are in high places; for mercy will soon pardon the meanest, but mighty men (not
standing in the Counsel of God) shall be mightily tormented. Therefore give ear
to him, you that rule the people, and glory in the multitude of Nations; for he
shall try your works, and search out your Counsels: Set your selves as true
servants of the Common wealth (in opposition to the Antichrist) against all
oppressors, that so they that seek with Haman to destroy and trample upon the
innocent (contrary to their expectation) may be disappointed. Let some course
be taken that all persons may buy their estates free from Tithes, that thereby
henceforth none in all your Dominions may be forced to pay Tithes to the
Ministers, for that has been, and is still the chief cause of persecution,
and discontent in these, and other Nations.
Suffer by no means (you having respect to the Honor of Christ) that any
Confession of Faith be set upon the Throne, as equal with the holy Scripture;
for Confessions are only to distinguish one Sect from another. Assist not with
the sword, or money of the Commonwealth any Sect, or person in particular,
that you may not hinder the truth (which has been long kept under) from
manifesting it self by it is own power; for Magistrates (as Magistrates) have
no permission to favor any Sect, or person in particular, if any of them
(being considered as a private person) will be a member of a particular
Congregation, he has his liberty, as well as others, and may honor the same
with his presence, with his tongue, with his pen, and with his own money; but
not with the sword or money of the Commonwealth: for the Magistrates (being
chosen by the generality of the people) are to stand immovable in the Center,
(as Moderators) between all Sects: They are in regard of their office, as
treasurers, who are entrusted with a sum of money to employ the same, not for
their own, or any ones private advantage in particular, but for the benefit of
all those that have entrusted them; if it were the magistrates work to set up
a National Ministry according to their own will, then we should be in danger to
have as many religions, as there be several ways of government in the world,
and the Magistrates changing their opinion, the whole National Ministry must
also as often be changed: What is that, then, but to do his own will, instead
of the will of God, and to have his pleasure upon the souls of men. It were
better, and belongs especially to your office, not to follow the traditions of
men, but to examine and reform the Laws now in force, and to disanull such as
are destructive and without mercy; contrary to the Law of Nature, and the
revealed will of God: which ought to be in all ages, and in all Countries, only
our rule. It is also your honors work and business, diligently to consider,
what properly belongs to the office of a Magistrate, before you put the sword,
and power of these Nations into their hands: for through want of care in so
weighty a matter, the whole Commonwealth is in danger (as in times past) to
fall under the dominion of one particular Sect, whose Ministers (to bring the
common people, and so the Magistrates, under their jurisdiction) are commonly
infecting with their forms, not only the public meeting-places, and the houses
of the poor, or hospitalls. but also the Schools (called Universities) which
have by the subtilty of them in all Countries; almost lost the name Universal,
by being misapplied to self ends and interests. Now to reform those
corruptions, it is necessary that the magistrates, (whose work it is to have an
eye to the good of all) do expel out of those public houses or Colleges
(being builded with the money of the commonwealth) all mere humane forms of
Religion, that they may not longer make a trade and merchandise of the things
of God. Granting an equal liberty to all peaceable people (as being but
reason) that such as have ventured their lives and estates in the time of
wars, should in the time of peace enjoy a like liberty with others; which may
soon be, if you seriously consider the things all along propounded; not that I
am come unto England to be your instructor, but to bring to your Honors
remembrance those very things, which have been upon your own hearts, in order
to the establishing of such a general liberty, as has been for many years of
late pretended unto; being the only way wherein you may expect the blessing of
God upon you, and your posterity, against all oppressors, to the taking away of
that shameful reproach, that the Magistrates, and Ministers, in England have
brought down the King and Bishops, rather to succeed in their places, then to
bring the people to peace and happiness. If the power (to defend the good
against the evil) in all Countries be ordained of God, Romans 13. then reason
requires, that all sorts of people of what Nations soever, being in one
Country together, should be protected, as well as if any of them severally was
in his own: which cannot be, except there be a good publick-minded and godly
Magistrate, that will suffer all sorts of people in any one Country, as God
suffers the same in all Countries of the world; which I expect first in
England, and so from thence to break forth (as a light) to all other Countries
and Nations, as having long enough walked (as in the night) by the glimps of
particular lights. It is time that the universal work of God (as the Sun) do
outshine all that is particular; to which end I implore the presence of the
most high God, to be in your Assembly to guide and direct your hearts in all
those things, that may be acceptable unto him, and most agreeable to his good
will and pleasure.

Your Honors, and all men's humble servant, Peter Cornelius, V. Z.
London the 24. of Jan. 1659. Hollands style.
Give ear to the poor, for the cry of them is exceeding great in these Nations.
Peter Cornelius, V. Z. (together with some other lovers of the common good) to
the Mighty, Potent, Farre-renowned (yet mortal) Lord Oliver Cromwell, Protector
of England, Scotland, and Ireland, etc. For the promoting of good Government,
wishes long life, wisdom, and foreseeing Counselors of State, to the end,
that his actions may tend, not only to the convincing of all that envy him,
but that also he may be a light, and an example to all Dominions, and
Governments in the world.
WOrthy, and (as I hope) favorable Lord, being come into England during the
time of your free government, I have with much cheerfulness beheld the great
freedom, which this Nation (since the putting down the authority of Bishops)
does enjoy, which I hope by degrees, will more and more prevail in the world,
to the taking away of all force upon Consciences, that men may be led and
governed by reason, as men, and not as beasts, by compulsive power. And that
those who are once delivered from the Antichristian Captivity, may not be taken
Captive again by others; who, together with the great Antichrist, seek their
own greatness; It is most highly necessary that the Example of Christ (to
reconcile all into one) should be followed; for those that force the
Conscience, being not able to bring all under them by worldly power, do
commonly manifest their own inclination to be void of Christian love, and
forbearance, by gathering into Sects and Schisms, so that besides the great
Antichrist, there are many little Antichrists, that endeavor to rise up. None
of which, being able to endure any opposition, or gainsaying, do seek to gain,
and draw a part of Christendom under their jurisdiction. On the contrary, the
Lord Jesus Christ has taken captivity captive: That is, put those to shame
that held others Captive, by his Ascension into heaven, and gave gifts unto
men, that they should not be led astray again, viz. he gave as means to
salvation, Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers; whose
doctrine alone, while it is yet through Gods mercy; as a measuring line or clue
of thread in the world, we should set that on the Throne, treading under foot,
all mere humane traditions, as Idolatry: That so all Christendom, being
divided into diverse Sects (as formerly the Jews were) a general way of
Church-meeting may be instituted, for the hearing of Gods word read unaltered
and unsophisticated, leaving a freedom for all Sects, as well the one as the
other to assert their own apprehensions and understandings upon the Lessons of
their Master Christ, without being tied to one another opinions.


For it belongs only to God and Christ to have dominion over Consciences, and to
Magistrates to prevent any from exercising Lordship over the Consciences of
others; in so doing they would be true maintainers and defenders of Liberty,
when they use not their power against those that assert their own meanings, but
against those that would compel others to be of their opinions. For this, viz.
to deal equally in matters of Religion toward subjects, is not only good and
pious, but is also the foundation of a good Government. Whereas otherwise, when
one Sect shall be encouraged and commended to the Church, and the other
excluded, then jealousy and envy will spoil all; so that the Magistrate in
stead of being beloved, may often fear that their State will be undermined, and
at length totally destroyed; especially, when that one party is become
numerous, or do join with a foreign or homebred enemy. Wherefore, though they
should want the fear of God, yet for their own peace-sake, they should give
freedom to all: and the rather seeing thereby the noblest and best of
understanding, are from all places invited and convened in: for whose wisdom
sake (as of Joseph's in Egypt) without respect of persons, they ought to be
suffered to come in by the Magistrate for the common good and welfare. So that
there may not only be a refining in Civil, or Politic, but chiefly in
spiritual matters. For as formerly amongst the Jews, (when men began to
believe that the Priests under the Law could not err, as to their Institutions
and Traditions) Gods commands were made void or of no effect: After the same
manner also has it been since the time of the Apostles in Christendom, that
instead of the holy Scriptures only (having been confirmed by Miracles) which
should be held a rule of Faith; yet some (being lovers of themselves) have
taken upon them a dominion, jointly with Christ, giving out, that men must
believe and hold for true, what ever the Church, ( viz. the Bishops, or other
superintendents thereof) do declare as truth. The common people not perceiving
(by reason of the great respect which they bear to those that are set over
them) that some of them seek to make themselves great, they have soon attempted
to hold forth the authority of the Scriptures, according to their own sense;
upon which when they have introduced matters contrary to reason, and people
have refused to receive them for authentic, they have by their acquired
authority kindred the people, from so much as to speak or whisper against it;
constraining them to believe what they say, and also to rely upon them and
their absolution: and to take away all scruple from the people, have given out
that they will answer for them at the day of judgment; Yea moreover (which is
far more terrible) will undertake to pawn their souls for theirs. By which
persuasions, the people being in anxiety fall into their bosoms, (as in former
times) in their gross darkness, oppugning the holy Scriptures and the
consciences of some, with greater earnestness, are resisted and rejected. Yet
these men being driven out by Tyranny, and separated from Popery, have commonly
something of that sower-leaven remaining in them, to bind others to their
opinions, making, as a foundation of their fellowship, new forms, over and
besides the holy Scriptures: whereby they have not exalted Christ but
themselves: they have not held close to that only name, which was given for men
to be saved by; but many names, as heads of parties (according to the different
forms) they have brought into the world. Whence great strangeness, making of
parties, yea, sometimes war, and horrible blood-sheddings have ensued: which
have been managed, not for the sake of the holy Scriptures, (which they all
held for truth) but to keep up their own opinions: till again, some more
understanding men perceiving the various differences of the forms and ways,
and the mischief and wicked disturbance, which this strife and variance, in
writings of disputations and controversy has produced, have justly rejected
all names and rules, besides the name and rule of Jesus Christ, living among
them, as men full of love and forbearance; whose understandings and life, clash
not against the holy Scriptures and found reason: although they differ among
themselves in apprehensions upon some places of the Scripture, but do continue
in brotherly love and unity; by which forbearance they do not only set others
in the right way (so far as they are in the truth) but are also by others
brought out of the way, wherein they themselves did err: a thing which ought
to bear sway with all men, according to the words of Christ (As you would that
men should do unto you, so do you unto them also) that they should bear with
one another opinions and conceptions, as they would themselves be born withal
in theirs. For it has more the resemblance and appearance of compelling the
Consciences, and of Tyranny, then of Reason, to press any one to come up to
another apprehension, as necessary, before he can apprehend it with his own
understanding to be good and necessary.

This has been in former ages the policy of Persecutors, and makers of Sects
and Schisms; who not only have cast out by their power, such, whose
understanding they could not bring to agree with theirs: but being unable to do
it, have made great broils, rents, and divisions in the world; whereas every
one (since God is so long suffering) ought with constant persevering love
(without despairing in the work) to labor according to their power to
enlighten others, that are in darkness. For if those that have the light
reject others, or depart from them; then the blind having no good leaders, must
needs go astray, and being led by the blind fall into a deep abyss of
Ignorance. On the contrary, all true lovers of the common good, do labor not
only to take out of the world Factions, but also all humane inventions (as much
as in them lies) that so the Lord Jesus may alone remain Lord and Master;
whose sayings they bear great honor and respect unto, although they possibly
cannot understand the meaning of some particulars; yet being confirmed by
signs and wonders; do hold the same for good and true. In which thing as to
the salvation of man, they will put no trust or affiance in any besides Jesus
Christ; nor yet receive any thing as truth, but that which they themselves can
apprehend to be good and agreeable to his doctrine; therefore do they
themselves not set up or own any authority, whereby men should rely upon it,
nor yet should give any others Authority whereby to draw men into their party,
but should bind all men unto Jesus Christ, whom they acknowledge only for Head
and Savior.

We desire from the bottom of our hearts, that all men might be gathered
together under that one name, and that your Highness (from whom almost every
one expects some special work) will help to cleanse the Christian Religion,
and worship of God, from all prevailing exorbitances; and to that end would
institute (as an eternal memorial and example to all Dominions and
Governments in the world) in every City and in every County throughout England,
Scotland, and Ireland, one general Christian assembling or meeting place, in
such a form, that all people may see one another round-about by the help of
seats, rising by steps, having before them convenient leaning-places to read
and write upon; also one desk aloft on one side or end, to hear the holy
Scriptures read at a set time, giving freedom after that reading, to all
people, orderly to confer together, concerning the Doctrine and Instruction of
their Lord and Master Christ: That all Lording over Consciences being
prevented, all people might come together, without receiving any obstruction by
any human forms or contrivances, even as the Jews being divided into several
Sects (as Pharisees, Saduces, Esseens, and Herodians, etc.) met together in one
Temple, so we would not deny any particular Congregations of their freedom, of
peaceable meeting among themselves about the Ordinances of Jesus Christ (as the
Orders or Synagogues of the Jews were not at all infringed) nor bereave the
Ministers or Teachers of their benefit, which they receive (of their own
people) for their maintenance: for they having a fit opportunity, may the
better bring in their sense with others, into this general Church-meeting.
That so the truth getting enlargement, the honest party may be resolved into
unity, and the bad (that cannot endure the light) may be discovered, and made
known; who only seeking Dominion and rule, should not by any means be employed
in high places, in matters civil or spiritual; that so the seat of Government
may not be usurped by their Adherents, when things go contrary to their minds
(being cruel Wolves) who in seeking of their advantage, will not spare the
flock, over which the Rulers (who should be placed to keep the people in order)
ought especially to take care, that they do not hinder them from the liberty of
speaking freely; as it happens commonly in particular assemblies or
congregations, contrary to the laudable practice of the Jews, Acts 13.15. who
themselves, after the reading of the Scriptures, did invite and stir up Paul
and Barnabas (being strangers) to speak.

Hence when understandings might be so free and uninterrupted, there would not
only arise a clearing of the understanding, and reforming of the lives of
people; but also a yielding, submissive, condescending love: for the wisest and
expertest men daily coming thus together, to teach and to be taught; it would
incline the hearts of those that should behold them, one toward another, which
we may discern in worldly matters, (as in making of Treaties or Peace with
Nations) whereas otherwise they being drawn up, and stretched beyond their
present apprehensions, by the supreme Authority, they stand upon their guard in
opposition to one another, as well in spiritual as Civil affairs. This now
being so, it will especially concern your Highness, whilst the eyes of all are
fixed upon you, to set a complete Example, that all people (that do slander
you, as to have no Religion) may evidently perceive, that you do only maintain
the Christian Religion, and not Countenance any other particular name or Head
whatsoever. For Jesus, the only heavenly Teacher, (who has been long enough
trod under foot by Sectarians) ought to be set up above all; and that all men
as Brethren be joined together, is the only way to abollish all Lording over
Consciences; which has already driven him out of his seat, and many hundred
years since possessed his place, that at length the spiritual usurpation, with
its Antichristian Dominion, may be laid down at his feet.

Thus doing you will be accounted a follower of the example of the good King
Josiah, 2 Kings 23. who to reform the Jews worship of God, threw down all
Chimerims and Idolatry, and brought forth the book of the old Covenant, to the
ears of the people; and all the people stood in that Covenant. So will all
Christendom (unless any would set up man, to rule together with Christ)
commend your diligent and wise forecast, and circumspection, and pray for the
prosperity of your estate, to the ruin of the Romish Seat, which (together
with all that would force Consciences) hearing the report of this noble
Freedom, will begin to tremble, yea, even their silenced children, whose
mouths have been muzzled by compulsive restraint, will begin to speak; and so
in time of need, seeing your free Government, may come to shroud themselves
under your wings. To which, God the Father who beholds you, and all Men's
actions, afford his grace, through Jesus Christ, Amen.

To his Highness Oliver Lord Protector, of England, Scotland, and Ireland, etc.
MIghty, and (as I hope) prudent Lord, being by the Loadstone of your free
Government drawn, and come into England, I have not only beheld the
multiplicity of Opinions, and various differences of Sects (who have been long
held together in a false peace) but also have laid before you an expedient (in
my Letter of the 24. of June) to bring them together to a true real unity.

I hope (seeing the bonds of Antichrist are in a great measure broken in
England, by the effusion of much blood,) that you as a skilful Pilot, will keep
your hand at the Helm, and your eye upon the sail, that so the little
Antichrists, who seek to rule over Consciences, may not bring your work to
shame and reproach, by exciting you to Tyranny, and thereby obstruct you in
perfecting the same. For several Princes and Magistrates have formerly
labored to bring down the Antichrist; but not rightly knowing the nature
thereof, have (unawares) not observed the little ones, while they oppose the
great ones only, as Bishops and others; and the little, self-seeking ones to
become great, have to their power helped the Magistracy (as if themselves were
Enemies of the spiritual domination) only that they might succeed in the
others places, which evidently appeared as soon as ever they began to take
breath, in that they have instituted new forms (the cause of Sects and parties)
by framing new Articles of faith, over and besides the holy Scripture, thereby
to shut men up within the Park or Enclosure of their own opinions; by which
means they set not up Christ in the hearts of men, but their own Kingdom and
Dominion, which is Idolatry. And the Rulers being brought on their side,
oppression has been exercised upon such as have not worshipped their Images (I
mean their contrived Forms) without life.

Now to oppose these deceitful spirits, who in an Angellicall humility and
lowliness, come with great and lamentable complaints and petitions. The good
Magistrates, to the end they be not deceived, should, for the protecting of the
Innocent, be armed with a Divine foresightfulnesse, and circumspection, for
they by all means (as if the Magistrates could make their dead Forms live) do
incessantly implore the interposing their Authority, well knowing, that there
is no better way, to bring the Common People (wherein the strength of a Nation
consists) under their jurisdiction, and do sometimes set the Magistracy (which
to govern well cannot be too high) by degrees higher and higher; yea upon hopes
thereby to have their Forms subscribed unto) resolve to make any body their
King or Emperor; being well assured, that when he has thus given up his power
to them, and set them on the Throne, they may afterward do with him what they
will.

For the most part all Kings have lost their power, by giving too much
Authority to the Ministry or Teachers, and have become (instead of Lords,
servants; yea (fearing the opposition of them and their followers) have for
their sakes become Tyrants.

Considering these things, the Magistrates to whom (and not to the Teachers)
the sword is given, for the protection of the good, should hold it fast, to
prevent and frustrate all cunning and subtle practices, and instead of giving
Ministers or Teachers power and Authority, should (by their general Assemblies
set up in all Cities and Countries) draw the common people out of their bosoms
and dominion, that they may loose their usurped power, that so the sword may
return into its right place, for which God has ordained it, without the
Magistrates needing in their Government, to have dependence on the Ministers or
Teachers, who are wont to incense the people against them. This (besides that
the whole power will come into the hands of the Magistrates) will bring many
thousands a year to the Commonwealth. For the people having opportunity to
come into the general Assemblies, out of love to hear many wise understanding
men, will not need to give maintenance to the hirelings, who Lord it in
particular Congregations, whereby the Magistrates (who now begin to lighten or
ease the burden of maintenance) will be beloved more then formerly. Then
shall we first be able rightly to discern, when the power is come into its
right place, what the Magistrates are, who now many times are accounted
oppressors, and evil Governors: though it may be that oppression and evil
government does proceed more from the nature of the Teachers, then of the
Magistrates, who (now the way to make the Teachers powerless is opened) will
begin to appear more evidently then formerly, and the more, because the common
assembling place may be instituted for drawing of the people from the Ministers
in all places, without compulsion of any man, bringing all Sects (without
giving wages to any) as brethren to equal privileges. But if those that are of
one and the same opinion, will have particular Congregations, and
Set-Ministers, let themselves pay them as a Master does his servant. For its no
reason that a man should help to maintain another servants; especially, if
they be such as (in his judgment) are soul-destroyers; who (being in his
senses) would assist such enemies as do countermine him? Is it not to be
wondered at, that the Ministers (who would be esteemed more then the
Magistrates) should (to the shame of their Church or Congregations) desire
wages of them, for whom they have not labored? Neither is it the mark of a
true Church, where the Members thereof are so covetous, and unmercifull, that
they will not maintain or provide for their own Ministers; and the Teachers
(loving the wages of unrighteousness) do (contrary to the 10th. Commandment)
covet the goods of others; whereof the Apostles and their Congregations* would
have been ashamed to think, much less would do it. Yet I hope, that once the
Conscience-burthening-law of constraining to pay Tithes to the Ministers (who
seek rather after Lucre then the Truth) for the rest of these Nations, will be
made null and void. Some course being taken to supply the necessities of the
Ministers, who by such Act (that none shall be forced to pay Tithes to them)
may be brought to a want of a subsistence; and yet that this may be so done,
only for those that are now made destitute, but no encouragement for any others
in time to come. And by this the Magistrates (while every Sect maintain their
own Ministers) will be freed from laying such intolerable burdens on their
Subjects, having to provide for none else, but those, who are appointed in the
general Assemblies or meeting-places, to read the holy Scriptures, and keep
the people in order; to show that they are no maintainers of Sects, but of the
Christian Religion; being as Fathers and Mediators, to bring the good together,
out of all Sects, to unite under the name of Jesus, to the end that his
Kingdom and Government may be enlarged, for an example to Holland, Denmark,
Sweden, France, and other Kingdoms, who seeing there is no force nor
constraint used, will easily be brought to a firm bond of Unity. This being the
only means by forsaking all Men, and human-Forms, to be blessed by Christ
(whose honor only is sought) against the Antichrist, contrary to the way of
other Kings and Princes, who being separated from Popery, have made themselves
unworthy of the blessing of Christ, by giving honor to the bare name of
Luther, Calvin, and others, instead of giving it to Christ, having been
deceived by the little Antichrists their followers; who as well as the great
one, seek their own glory; ease, and idleness; and as if they had no
fellowship with the great Antichrist, have put the holy Scriptures into the
common peoples hands, which was before was prohibited to be read, only seeking
that we should agree with them in their Forms, applying and fitting themselves
(such is their subtilties, to the temper of the times: as a Fowler gives scope
to a Bird he has already in a string, that so at length it may be content to
live in a Cage. Now against these little Antichrists, who under the name of
giving liberty, would bind the people to their opinions) the Magistrates (being
taught by experience) should as well counter-work, as against the great, that
they may come to the very root, bringing the holy Scripture (which was formerly
prohibited to be read) with great Triumph into the general Assembly or
meeting place, and set it on high, to the end that the found or report of this,
to wit, that Christ alone must rule (by his word) in the hearts of men, among
all Nations (according to the great work done in England) may be heard, giving
liberty to every one, after the reading of the Scripture (contrary to the
little Antichrist, who will have it understood only according to their own Forms
and Expositions) to set forth his own apprehension, without being bound to any
ones opinion: That spiritual matters being applied to spiritual, Antichrist
may be stormed with two Armies, viz. the Truth against Error, and the material
sword against oppressors, who by their arrogating disposition and exclusion of
others, do seek to restrain the liberty of speaking, which discovers the errors
of the understanding for the cure thereof. Whereas, by stopping the mouths of
people (as heretofore) they make men incureable.

Now to further this, that the weakness or Ignorance of some may be remedied
by the knowledge of others, without disturbance or Confusion, it will be
necessary that the Authority of the Magistrate interpose in this general
Assemby or meeting place, that every one may speak in their order, staying
their time, and those that break order, may (after due warning) be ejected,
till they are better disposed, without oppressing them by Imprisonment or
otherwise.

This would be glad tiding, yea, a true year of Jubilee, for those that lie in
prison, only for asserting their opinions in matters of Religion; that now they
may (together with others) bring in their understandings into this general
Assembly, to receive or give light. And to the end, that Antichrist (or he that
exalts himself above others) may be continually shut out, it is exactly to be
observed, that no pre-eminence or sole privilege be granted to any, (of
offering any thing, or of speaking first) that so every one being at liberty
and unhindered, may bring forth that which is most conducing to the Common
welfare, according to the words of Paul, 1 Cor. 14.16. All of them sitting
still, so long after the reading of the Scriptures (as being swift to hear and
slow to speak) till any one think it fit (in his judicious and humble mind) to
propose somewhat for mutual edification; endeavoring withal to make his
discourse short, that another may have his turn likewise, contrary to the
custom of the common Teachers, who only, or solely speaking, do lengthen out
their discourse, to the weariness of their Auditory; for which end the
Moderators (who ought to be meek and understanding men) are to observe that
there be due order kept.

This (seeing no Forms or Articles are made in it besides the holy Scripture)
will be a Council and Synod, standing always open, to all rational people,
without imposing any man's conclusions, contrary to the former Assemblies, who
have excluded all Nations and Posterity (by their self conceitednesse) dividing
people, as by a wall of separation, one from another, by their Forms: whereupon
great estrangement has ensued, as if they were different Nations. And the
better to set up their Antichristian Kingdom and dominion, have so contrived
their Catechismes, that they have bound up, and so spoiled the understandings
of their children, before they come to have the use of Reason, holding their
dependants or Members, captive under them in their Net, as beasts, contrary to
the order of their Creation: well knowing, that if they gave them the liberty
of speaking, they would not be long worshipped as Idols, or sacrificed to, as
Bell at Babell.

Contrariwise, people, in the general Assemblies, when all understandings and
tongues are free, will be stirred up to the exercise thereof, and by conferring
together, will come to knowledge, love, and familiarity. The truth (which has
been long kept under or with held in unrighteousness) will scatter the lies, as
light does darkness, and the great credit, which we have given to some
Teachers in particular, will by opposition be diminished, and the power of all
Sects; (the one dispelling the Errors of the other) will be broken.

This will be the place, where we shall discern and learn to know, the most
wise as Solomon, and meek as Moses; which out of all Sects (only such as seek
to domineer over others excluded) may be appointed as Counselors, The
Magistrates from the highest to the lowest, ought to be men of public sp^^its
for their work (concerning their office) is not a particular, but a general
work.
to keep steady the balance of Government, without respect of persons, to the
end, that the Spirit of God be not confined; which will be a sure mark, that
Wisdom (for the sake of which Kings in times past were blessed) is under this
Government esteemed above gold and silver; being the principal to distinguish
all things, chiefly Policy from Religion, for the common good: For Magistrates
(if they would remain without usurping the Office of Christ) may not make Laws
in matters of Religion, but against evil deeds, to protect the good: To the
end, that their Subjects (from whom they receive Taxes and Impositions) may be
protected in peace, of what Religion soever they are: For the power to punish
evildoers, is ordained of God in all Lands, without respect of Religion, and
whosoever opposes that power, opposes the Ordinance of God; not that all
Officers (though they rule ill) are of God, or are his Ministers, but those
only, who administer their Office rightly, according to Gods will: Otherwise,
those who heretofore have risen up against Tyrants, opposing their persons,
should have been indeed opposers of Gods Ordinance: contrary to that of the
Apostle, Romans 13. who has said, that such as are continually employed in the
defense of the good, are the Ministers of God, until they have by false
Teachers, been drawn besides their Office, to domineer over Consciences, and so
brought into the service or Ministry of Satan, to the grief of their Subjects.

But I hope, that once the sword, which has been withheld from liars and
oppressors, shall cut them off together with the Cable of their hope (the
Tithes) that so the ground of almost all oppression being taken away, not only
the Subjects, but also the Magistrates, may live in peace; who are now
continually liable to hear the complaints of the head Sectaries, who seek to
domineer over others, it being the nature of such, who finding their own
weakness, do make power and force their refuge, contrary to the example of
Christ and the Primitive Saints, whose strength was only the evidence of truth.
Wherefore all people (and chiefly Magistrates) are to take heed that they
assist not lies, using their power (according to Gods Ordinance) only against
those that are to the prejudice of good Government, or the hurt of mankind in
general, without mingling Policy, and Religion, which were ordained for
several ends; the one to defend the good men against the evil, and the other
to make the evil good. There remains only, that the Magistrates (for an
example to their Subjects) do null all humane commanding and constraining-Laws
in spiritual matters, that so all plants, which the heavenly Father has not
planted, may (according to the saying of Christ) be rooted up, which will best
take effect when the dominion of the Teachers, is through the power of the
Governors, come to an end; and their hope of domineering over others cut off.
For Magistrates, instead of Lording it over Consciences, ought on the contrary
to hinder all Lordship over Consciences, that complaining and murmuring may
come to an end, and that the righteous may rejoice.

For which end, that we may transmit the World unto our posterity, in a better
condition then we first found it, I have contributed this little to my power.

I beseech your Highness, let not any preingagement oblige you, to what you may
afterward see inconsistant with the Magistrates true interest, with the due
liberty of Gods people, and the free propagation of the Gospel. It were better
for you and more for your Honor with Ahashuerus, to contradict your own hand
and Seal, then with Herod, to perform a rash engagement.

But while it is yet in your Highness choice, let not the right hand of brave
Atchievments for the vindication of liberty be ever stained with authorizing
(to the honor of men, and dishonor of Christ) any Confession of Faith,
Ordinance, or Decree; which will in the least entrench thereon, or indulge the
enemies thereof. Be not deceived, by such persons as pretend to advance your
Honor, as in the time of Daniel was done to King Darius, that the good people
in those and other Nations, may not be disappointed of their hope and
expectations in you.

I do wish for conclusion, that your Highness, and all your Counselors of
State, to the bringing down of Antichrist, and all his Adherents, may have a
great heart, and humble under God and Christ. That the great work done in
England, come not to the Honor of a mortal man, but to the honor of him, who
has received the power over the Kingdoms of the earth.

Be wise as Serpents, and innocent as Doves, Matthew. 10.16.

O Lord of all Lords, and Magistrates, teach them that rule as Gods in the
world, to consider, that they are but men in thy eyes; That they may handle
their Subjects after such a manner, as they wish to be handled by thee in thy
judgment.
To his Highness Richard Lord Protector of England, Scotland, and Ireland, etc.
Peter Cornelius wishes, an universal and unbiased heart, to the end he may as
a true Moderator so hold the balance in the Government, that one Sect may not
domineer over the other.
Unexpected, yet (I hope) seasonable Lord Protector,
BEing come into England in love, to the common good, I have after much longing
several times had opportunity to speak with your Father about diverse matters,
to whom also I delivered two Letters, which he promised to consider of, and was
willing I should have liberty further to declare my mind and sense unto him:
this being prevented by his unexpected death, I have thought fit forasmuch as
your Highness has succeeded him, to transfer the aforementioned Letters to
you, hoping that my counsel (which your Father did not despise) being joined
with your power and goodness, will order all things in such a way that the
light of liberty kindled in England, may enlighten all Kingdoms and
Governements in the world.

Your Highness is not ignorant how the Pope of Rome, and the Bishops have held
many thousands, in these, and other Countries, together in a false Peace by the
bands of Tyranny, until some magnanimous spirits (not able any longer to bear
that injustice) did with a strong arm, throw of the Tyrannical yoke, by
reason whereof the false peace, being thus interrupted the people is become
divided into many kinds of Sects and opinions, which yet is better then to have
them bound together in a false peace, with the bands of Tyranny, for the
diseases as well of the mind, as of the body, cannot be cured unless they be
first manifested, neither would he do the part of a skillful Surgeon, that
should endeavor to skin over the wound, without cleansing the bottom, but
rather discover his base design in preferring his own Interest before the
health and welfare of the Patient, for this cause it will be good to suffer
every one without any let or hinderance, to manifest his sense and disease (as
well in spiritual as bodily matters) to the very bottom, that so the
corruptions being found out, the remedy for cure of the same may be applied, to
which purpose that every error might meet with its Antidote; I did in my
Letters delivered to your Father, propound the setting up a general
meeting place, in all Cities and Countries, which might stand as a clear light
between all Sects, for the dispelling of errors; not by violence, but by the
power of Scripture and reason, without binding up the liberty of speaking,
(whereby the defects of the understanding are kept hidden) which is already
much labored after by the little Antichrists, that seek their own greatness,
but I hope that you, perceiving the mystery of Iniquity, will above all things
remember Englands liberty, which has cost much blood, and with a generous
spirit bring down all designs how subtle soever, without being deceived, by
such as come in sheeps-cloathing, with smooth and flattering words, and in a
fair and specious outside, show themselves like Angels of light, against whom
you ought as well to be armed with prudence, as against open enemies, that so
the sword which is given for the protection of the good, may not be abused by
those who have more hopes to prevail with you, then they had with your Father,
who knew their dispositions by long experience, yet I hope you will show, and
demonstrate by your works and actions, that you will in that, not only follow,
but exceed the Exampler of your Father, by not establishing any particular
Sect, (which in other Countries has caused a total destruction of liberty) but
by maintaining a tolleration for all; For the Lord of heaven has not designed
England, for a particular but for a general work, therefore it is one of the
main businesses of Magistrates, to try the spirits of those that repair to
them, for there are two kinds of Spirits that stand in direct opposition,
always working the one for their own particular, and the other for the common
good, not only to cure the distempers of the mind, but also to take off the
burdens and afflictions of the body, and when you are at a loss, stand
centred in the eternalls will, who can make way for true wisdom, to direct and
lead you in and out, before the people. Thus having born testimony against all
oppression, I leave it to God, your Self, and your Counsel, not doubting but if
it should prove ineffectual God will raise up instruments for delivering of the
oppressed,

and subscribe my self to be, A well wisher of Englands liberty, and all other
Nations happiness, Peter Cornelius, Van-Zurick-Zee.

FINIS.
A merciful man (being sensible of the poverty and afflictions of others)
cannot be in peace before he have done his endeavor (according to his power)
to ease the burdens and afflictions of the opressed: therefore have I, to
discharge my duty, in another Treatise (which is to be published) propounded a
way to make the poor distressed people, in these, and other Nations happy.
