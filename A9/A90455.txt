THE ILLUSTRIOUS SHEPHERDESS.

Dedicated to the MARCHIONESS OF DORCHESTER.



LONDON: Printed by J. C. for Nath. Brook, at the Angel in Cornhil, 1656.

To the Right Honorable, THE MARCHIONESS OF DORCHESTER.
MADAM,
SInce if the beauty of Mandana, the Charming Modesty of Statyra, the Majesty
of Mariamne; (and, which is more than all these, since she has had the honor
to be presented by a person, as considerable in his title, as the exaltedness
of his Mind and Spirit, to a Lady of resembling quality) the high attractions
of Parthenissa: if all that has been mentioned Great and Virtuous in all the
Stories that have yet been written, were contracted into One, to make a
resemblance of your divine Perfections, they would yet fall short to express
them: I am induced to believe, That to present your Honor with this piece of
imperfection, can be but the same presumption as to have interrupted your more
important diversions with any thing of the most refined and accomplished that
ever Courted Fame: it being the Prerogative of Greatness, to confer that value
upon meaner things out of Favor, which even the greatest could not be capable
to obtain by desert: Nor could this Design have confessed its deficiency by a
nobler way, than by imploring so bright an influence: and those things which
pretend to highest consummation, should they ground their Dignity upon their
own Compleatnesse, they would become as much unworthy your Condescension, as to
obtain what they pretend to; they would stand in need of it, and thereby divest
themselves of their most glorious Title, which is to admire, and wait upon
excellencies greater than any themselves could show: for it were a gross
stupidity, Admiration being the inseparable Concomitant of those infinite
Glories and Beauties which shine in your Soul, and throw a Radiant Luster round
about you, if our Resentments should not be as High as the Cause is Noble that
produces them: Had you only derived those vast Applauds which are rendered you
by all those with whom Virtue has any Concernment, from your happy Relations,
as being Wife to that Noble Lord, whose Grandezza's of Spirit are so many, and
whose Learning shines in so immense a degree, that (not only among those of a
resembling Extraction, but even among the Meaner sort of Men, who not being
Considerable in themselves, may happily be incited to seek for Eminence by the
Study and Profession of Arts) few have attained to that sublime Perfection;
and next, as Daughter to that incomparable Lady, whose recent Actions (great as
the Fame which eternally attends upon her Memory) not only transcend whatever
has been done of most Heroic, by the most famous of her Sex in all Ages, but
even Romances themselves, whose Custom it is to describe Actions as boundless
as Fancy can suggest, have not produced Examples more Illustrious among their
most exalted Hero's; this were a Condition glorious enough to Cover you with
more Palms than the world affords: And although there is no Consideration
equally powerful with the height of those Actions, to transmit the Glory of
them to Posterity; yet to decline the payment of the highest Attributes I could
be capable of rendering unto the Monument of so much Worth and Glory, would be a
Neglect as Criminal, as the Celebration of them a Duty. I shall not at present
longer insist upon the Elogium's of those Illustrious Personages, although they
are so just, that all tongues might ambition to dwell upon them; lest I might
seem to make you redevable for those Honors, which are the rightful Effects of
your own inherent Worth, unto those Excellencies which are owned by others. But
Madam, There are in your self advantages of so high a Nature, Virtues so bright
and unaccessional, which make you owe your Concernment in those glorious
Relations, more to Merit than to Fortune; that the Passion I have to Adore
them, is yet more powerful than what might render the confidence of this
Address pardonable: Yet since I represented to my self how much your Actions
are above Vulgar Applauds, the Apprehension of how unworthy a Title I had to
the Honor of Rendering them, had almost subdued my Inclination to an absolute
Declining of so great an Undertaking, had not a firm resolve rather to hazard
the Committing of so considerable a Crime, than not to express the Adoration I
have for Virtue, especially shining in so Illustrious a Mansion, made me
reassume my first Intention: And I confess, the Authors Fame had not a small
Ascendent upon me in this Election; Who, I believe, out of a fatal instinct
that his Design would come to appear before a Judgment so Comprehensive, and
so Penetrating a Wit, has made his Hero to perform somewhat of so gallant, that
in the narrow Limits to which he is confined, and his due regard to Likelihood
and Possibility, a particular, of which there are few Romances which make any
great Conscience; I see not how he could have performed more. And whether we
look on Silvia, dressed in the innocencies and unconstrained handsomness of a
Pastoral Conversation, or considered in the more resplendent gentillesses of
her true Condition; I am confident she will think her self more Fortunate in
being held worthy of your Acceptance, than in the bare Satisfaction she could
derive from either of these Conditions: Since in the former, there are no
becomingnesses which are not in you so conspicuous, as if those happy ages were
returned, wherein, to be a Princess and to be a Shepherdess, were the self-same
thing: and in the later, she is so darkened and exceeded by a more surpassing
splendour, that the greatest Privilege she can aspire to, is to court the
protection of a Greatness that so much out-shines her. Nor can I think my self
indifferently concerned in Silvia's Contentment, seeing the glory of presenting
her is not to be equaled by any thing, but by the Humility and Devotion
wherewith she is presented to so unspeakable a Felicity, By

MADAM, Your Honors most Humble, most Obedient, and most Faithful Servant, E.
P.

AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.
WHereas our Nation has been so profusely entertained, and perhaps by this
time in a manner Satiated by the fluency and luxuriance of the French
Gallantry; it will not be amiss to give a taste of the Spanish Reserve and
Gravity: And (since things of this nature are swelled to such an excess of
voluminousness) to correct one extreme with another, by publishing an Adventure
as concise as the rest are tedious. How they may relish abroad, I will not
think my self obliged to any strict regard: it is enough for me to say,
Montalvan was the Author; And that two others of the same original, Aurora, and
The Prince, were long since thought worthy to be rendered by Mr. Stanly, a
person of considerable Worth and Quality; whose Fame, if it be a stranger to
any, it is only to such who are not much concerned in Learning or Ingenuity:
and whatever advantages they may justly claim above these, I am not troubled to
be outdone by a person as much beyond me in Merit, as in Fame.

Whatever Peccadillo's may have Escaped in Printing, the Readers judgment may
Correct; only I thought fit to give this Precaution, That in the First Page in
stead of shares is to be read shines: And in Page 12 the Comma after Woman
should have been after undaunted.

The Illustrious Shepherdess.
THE Heaven had newly diplay'd it is blue Canopie, besprinkled with innumerous
flaming Gems; and that fair Star that leads up all the rest, and shares the
glory of the Evening, was so profuse of her Rays, that it might well have been
thought that either the Sun was not set, or else that another Sun had succeeded
in his room, and night, to whom he had surrendered his place, as to his lawful
Successor, reposed in the bosom of her beloved silence; when Albanius leaving
his little Flock of Sheep to feast themselves upon the sprouting dainties of
the Field, retired himself to Contemplate the misfortunes of his past life. For
though he was now advanced in years, yet he still retained a Passion, which in
the summer of his age had taken possession of his heart, having married a fair
Shepherdess, with whom he lived in a fashion so tender and respectful, as is
not to be expressed: (For Love, not always a Courtier, oft-times vouchsafes the
rustic Villages his presence) but he had not been Married above two years,
before her death deprived him of the sole felicity of his life, leaving him the
most disconsolate man on earth: he sat near to the brink of a clear Brook,
which with it is feet of silver, trampling upon the sands of gold, delighted to
flow along so many banks of Roses, and conveyed the moisture of life to some
certain little trees, that trusting to the swiftness of their growth, made
full account (ere many Springs had flourished) to become the Giants of the
Wood. Here the good Shepherd diverted his mind with the thoughts of his former
felicity, refreshing himself with those thoughts, the sweetness of the
flowers, and the wanton purlings of the crystal waves; when not far from the
place where he sat, he heard a shrill voice, that with many sighs and sobs,
often called upon Death; of which, not less sweet than mournful, the sportful
Zephyrets were enamored; and for the love of that sound, stood playing the
longer with the trembling leaves. Albanius arose, having his Soul touched with
a tender compassion: for he had not a breast where pity was denied to harbor,
nor was his Soul so base as to give it self up to fear: he was of a generous
spirit, though a Shepherd; and full of compassion, though the Inhabitant of a
rural Cottage: Musing with himself what should be the matter, he directed his
course along the margent of the Rivoler, toward the place from whence those
doleful accents seemed first to pierce his ear and his heart. He drew near to
a little Island, crowned about with trees so thick set together, that Day had
in it but a small jurisdiction. Entering into it, and wandering a while in that
delightful darkness, he came to the place where there sat a Lady of a
presence both lovely and majestic; who, with the pangs of Childbirth that had
but just left her, was so dismayed, that she seemed to have forgot whether she
lived or no: he drew nigh to her, and found her no otherwise accompanied, than
with an infinite number of perplexities, and that little creature but newly
delivered from it is former habitation, which enjoyed no other shelter than what
the green boughs afforded; taking up the babe in his arms, he cherished it,
wrapped it in his warm Mantle, and defended it from the bleak violence of the
night; then he applied himself to the Mother, who was half dead with anguish
and amazement; awaked her out of her short death, offered his best assistance,
endeavored to comfort her with friendly and courteous language.

The Lady took much notice of the Shepherds charitable usage, and looked upon
his arrival as an accident ordained by Heaven for the redress of her miseries;
and lifting herself up with much ado from that grassy Couch, she entreated him
to accompany her to the place from whence she had been taken; who showed
himself ready to serve her with all respect and civility: and she, to gratify
his courtesy, refused not (as they went along the way, he having requested her
name and quality) to satisfy his curiosity with the story of her misfortunes.

I am (said she) a Woman that have the ill fortune to be accounted fair, since
it ever happens, that the worst of chances do ever attend on beauty. I am born
of noble Parents, yet to me immeasurably cruel: they resolved in the midst of
my tender years, to devote me to a Cloistered life, consulting more my
obedience than my inclination; saying, That Children ought to subject their
Wills to their Parents pleasure: a Maxim perhaps not altogether void of
Reason, if it had been ordained by Fate, That all minds should consent together
in one Election, and not be carried on to different designs. But experience
informs, That the Will of Man naturally desires an absolute Sovereignty, to
have her motions free and unrestrained: but I was under an Influence that
threatened many crosses to my life; for though I could obtain of my affections,
to be swayed sometimes against the current of my Nature; yet I could never so
totally subdue them, as to make them become subservient in all things to my
Parents intentions: nor did it avail me to say, That what they proposs'd agreed
not with my disposition; affirming, that to allege this excuse, could not
acquit me from disobedience to them; and that I offended God, by gainsaying
those that advised me to be his Spouse; imputing this my adversenesse to their
persuasions, to unchastnesse; and resolved not to settle me in any condition
agreeable to my own Fancy, since I could not content my self with one of their
providing. In these discontents did I dream away the flower of my youth,
without the least enjoyment of it. And certainly my Parents were to blame, for
that they considered not that I was arrived to that maturity of years as was
not flexible to all impressions. I had brought my self even to the point of
despair, seeing these things fall out so crosly, at a time when I had yielded
up my affection to a noble Cavalier; a man, that, for his worth, might well
have deserved a Lady of the greatest fortune and extraction: the high esteem I
had of him, made me incapable to receive his Addresses with any great
indifferency. My Lover was very reserved in his designs, prudent in all his
actions, valiant without ostentation, affable and courteous to all, real and
fervent in his Love toward me; nor was he less beloved of me again. His
opportunities of seeing me were very frequent, his daily walks were under my
window, whereby we came to the Speech of each other; and there passed not a
night wherein he was not admitted into the house undiscovered by my Father or
Mother: as our affections, so our meetings increased (What a hazard does that
Maid run, though never so circumspect, that venters to see her lover often,
much more to parley with him?) Being thus divided and wavering between the
threats of my Parents, and the prayers of him I loved, I found a great conflict
within me: this only comfort was left me, That he who was absolute master of my
affections, had engaged himself to serve me with an eternal constancy and
fidelity. The frequency of his visits so confirmed our loves, that at length he
won me to yield him that last of Favors, which neither his entreaties, nor the
purity of his passion could ever obtain, till after a Solemn Contract between
us, in the presence of two Friends, most faithful to our design. His Father was
a Gentleman of Salamanca, (a noted City, the glory of Castile, and famous for
being the foster-Mother of noble Sciences) who had designed to marry him to a
Kinswoman of his. (Parents commonly count no Matches lawful, if they be not
altogether managed and concluded by their Counsels.) My Friend, loath to
displease his Father, seemed outwardly willing to entertain the motion; but for
my sake, spun out the time with many doubts and delays. It happened about this
time, that my Father being, for his eminent Learning and Deserts taken notice
of by his Majesty, was advanced to a place at Court of greatest Honor and
Profit: he glad of this unexpected preferment, and intending to make his best
advantage of it for the bettering his Fortune, resolved upon removing to that
place where his occasions required him present: mean while, the Marriage so
earnestly desired and endeavored between us, was disturbed by the arrival of
my Spouse's Father, who came himself in person on purpose to hasten his Sons
return to Salamanca, that they might treat about the Match between him and that
Gentlewoman, concerning whom he had so often writ to him; by this means I was
plunged into a most remediless ill plight: I durst not make my Case known to
my Parents; who were of that austere Nature, and so not to be persuaded to
yield to any of my desires, that they would sooner be brought to consent to the
taking away of my life, than not to have me confined to a Religious Cell: And
that which made my Condition the more insupportable, was, That I found in my
self the evident Symptoms of being with Child. So deeply did I lay to heart
these Crosses, that I sought occasions to bring my life to an end; and
doubtless I should have done it, but that I considered, that with my own, the
life of my Spouse was in danger, and that of my Infant in certainty to be lost:
and it had been indeed a barbarous cruelty to have slain this innocent Creature
whom as yet I have not seen, although it has so lately cost me innumerous
pangs. The preparations for our departure I knew not well how to resent;
notwithstanding I bore it out with the cheerfullest face I could, and employed
the deepest of my cunning to conceal my mischance: at length I feigned my self
extremely ill, discovering the truth to the Physician, that by his help, my
Fiction might be the more securely carried on; and thinking to conceal that by
keeping my Bed, which I had no other way to keep undiscovered; for all this, my
Father, that made no great matter of it, and judged by my countenance, That it
was rather the state and delicacy of a great Dame tenderly brought up, than any
real sickness that caused me to keep my Bed, forth with intended his voyage,
without any regard to my being ill, giving me a very short space to prepare for
the Journey: scarce had I time to dispatch a short Note to my Spouse; wherein,
with more abundance of Grief than Reason, I set forth the sadness of my
Condition, the heavy affliction of our being severed, and the fears and
dangers that attended me: When, by that time it was midday, and I with much
ado got ready, I was hurried with the rest out of the City; my Lover took
silent leave of me at a distance, and accompanied me with his eyes as far as he
could, endeavoring to make me understand the language they spoke: by the close
of day we reached Pinto, a place not directly in the Road; but by reason of a
piece of Land, which we there possess, we diverted thither. No sooner were the
rest of our Family well settled in their first sleep, but I perceived my self
surpised with great pains; which were the less terrible to me, because my
Soul was at that time as it were buried in other huge afflictions:
notwithstanding in a short space they increased in such sort, that I plainly
knew them to be the certain forerunner of my approaching labor; so that
leaving in the Bed a Servant-Maid, whom, having ever found most faithful to me,
I had made acquainted with my Condition; I thus solitary, distracted, and
careless, having no other company but my Sorrows to attend me, betook my self
to this Wood, and this soft Bed of Flowers; which Heaven, no question, out of
tenderness, lest my shame should be divulged, had made thus private; without
hopes of Aid from any, save the shelter of this little tree; nor enjoying any
other ease than my sighs: driven hither by this necessity, newly disburthened
(as you see) of this poor Infant, and almost brought to the jaws of Death;
here you have found me, being led hither by Providence, to be the Instrument of
my relief, and to save two lives at once; and, which is more, to protect my
Honor from all violation, by accompanying me to the place from whence I came,
if that small strength which is yet left me, will permit me to go so far: or at
least, if the force of these misfortunes shall prevail over my life, I shall
have obtained this benefit, to end my days with an unblemished Reputation.

Albanius heard these things, with the same seriousness she related them, and
was sorrowfully affected with the sadness of these passages. The adversity and
tears of so delicate a personage, were able to force pity from Rocks, and to
make rigor it self not rigid. She craved his Name, and in what place he abided;
and presented him with a Purse, enriched with a great number of Crowns; saying,
That she would commit to his Education that little Creature, and that she would
take care to give her Lover notice of this deliverance; and seriously enjoin
him to recompense, to the utmost of his power, this great humanity of his to
her and her Child.

He promised to perform, with all sincerity, the trust committed to him; and
having conducted her to a place not far distant from her dwelling, he took his
leave, admiring at the strangeness of this event, and especially to see so
undaunted a Woman, of such a soft and curious frame, and plunged in such
distress: but what will not a generous Soul adventure, rather than suffer
under a wounded Reputation? Returning home to his Cottage, he related to his
Wife (for he was again Married, although the Idea of his first Wives beauty
could never be effaced from his memory) the whole story of this Adventure; who,
for all this, would have been apt to have entertained jealous imaginations, if
the Gold (than which, there is nothing more persuasive, and of greater Credit
among men) which he brought along with him, had not satisfied those Scruples:
and calling to mind, that a few days before, one of her nearest neighbors
had, with ill successful labor, brought forth a Son, which no sooner had
touched the threshold of this life, but was snatched into the other world to
increase the number of the Angels; and thinking good to make use of this
advantage, they requested her to Nurse up this Child; which she willingly
accepted; esteeming the sweetness, and admirable features of it, to be such,
as that the earth might boast of being enriched with such a Seraphim: So
committing it to her care, they went to buy all things necessary for the
accommodation and adornment of so dainty an Infant.

While these things happened in the Village of Pinto, the Father of the Child
having been debarred the sight of that beauty he so much adored, was returned
to Salamanca; where being advertised by Letters, of this nights strange
success, he wrote immediately to Albanius, recom mending to him, with such
endearing expressions as would have moved a Spirit less tender than his to
have observed his desires, the Care of his Daughter; sending him such a large
testimony of his liberality for what he had already done, as might well declare
the generosity of his mind, and the plentifulnesse of his estate. At length,
some emergent occasions calling him away into Italy, he enjoined an intimate
Friend, to be nigh in vigilance and care, to the bringing up of his Daughter;
still giving so liberally, upon all occasions, that in a short space Albanius
became very rich, and had where withal to live contentedly, and at ease.

Silvia (for so the young disguised Shepherdess was called) grew up in beauty,
as in years, every day adding to her perfection: no sooner had she attained to
those years that made her capable of Marriage, but she was courted by the
principal men of the Village, who with Amorous, though Rustic lays, ambition'd
to be her Servants. She was so fair, that the Snow, which (if it had stayed in
the middle Region, would have been accounted white) compared with her Skin,
quire lost it is reputation; her Hair was of a hue, only so remore from the Sun,
and so near resembling the Earth, as, lest being all of Gold, it should have
been snatched up to it is own proper Sphere, and so have become a second
Ariadne's Crown; her Eyes, though black, yet quick and vivacious, and so
watchful over their own glances, that they were scarce permitted a lawful
liberty; her Cheeks free from the least tincture of art, displayed such a
purely mingled white and purple, that they could not, without disparagement,
have been compared either to Ivory or Gilloflowers; her Mouth was like a little
Wound, and her Lips animated Crystal, through whose transparency the blood
discovered it is pure redness; her Hands, two white soft Lilies, but much
whiter and softer than any the earth bears; or at least, they had been
certainly taken for Snow, but that they were unmelted by the Sun: she was of a
Disposition mild and complaisant, yet of so natural a courtly behavior, that
it might be wondered how in so low a condition she could bear so enlarged a
Soul, she was much delighted with the gallantry of some Gentlemen that used to
pass that way, and was much in their company, not out of any wanton desires,
but out of confidence that well became her; and secretly betrayed the
Illustriousnesse of her birth. (So hard it is for those descended from a
generous Lineage not to discover those virtuous inclinations that are
Hereditary to them.) She was walking forth one Summer-night, to cool her self
with the fresh Evening-gale, and to delight her self with the sweet smells of
Flowers, which the officious Airs brought to her on their wings, to please her;
when there happened to pass by a Gentleman of Madrid who was called Don
Francisco Osorio, accompanied with many Friends and Servants; who cast his Eyes
upon her; and though she was clad in mean attire, was strangely surpised at
the unexpected sight of so surpassing a beauty, whereby she was fancied to him
to be some rural Deity: forward he passed; and although he could have found in
his heart a thousand times to have looked back upon her, yet he abstained, when
he considered with himself that it would have been a disparagement to him, if
he should be seen to be overcome with her beauty, who was the inhabitant of a
poor Village: as if a Diamond were of the less price, for being inchas'd in
Lead, or circled about with counterfeit Stones. His Reason at length assisting
him to overcome the motions of his Will, he went on his Journey, and arrived at
Aranjuez; where having dispatched the business he came about, with the
greatest expedition that could be imagined, he so ordered his return to Madrid,
as to stay a while by the way at Pinto; (for there is a man's Kingdom, where his
Desire keeps Court;) his intent was to see Silvia, and to bring his companions
to a sight of her, that they might be Judges whether he had not a sufficient
pretense for his staying there: they informed themselves from a certain
labouring-man (whom they had won to their Service with Gifts) that she was
walking in a Garden, with some other Virgins her companions.

It was about the time that the Sun obscured by a very dusky evening, was just
taking his leave of the day, when they all going to see her, met her coming
forth of the Garden; Don Osorio began to salute her with a respect greater than
her seeming quality required: And taking advantage of the darkness of the
night, he spoke some things as a prelude to the discovery of his Passion.

Silvia, although well pleased that she was courted by a person of that quality
and behavior, was yet very slow to make any Answers, for fear she should be
judged to discover something of lightness in them, or at least, want of wit:
for where there is a disparity of conditions between persons, there cannot
safely be an intimate familiarity; the soundest and honestest of their
intentions being apt to be made the worst of, and discountenanced. At length,
overcome with a Maidenly shamefac'dnesse, she made more than ordinary haste to
be gone, partly out of her own modest inclinations, partly that she might take
away all occasions from her companions of insulting over her failings, that
they might not think that she had less command over her Affections than they.
Don osorio in the mean while was lefe differently affected, contented that he
had obtained the sight of her whom he adored; grieved to be so soon deprived of
such a happiness: but considering with himself, that this disfavour might
rather arise from the power of her bashfulnesse, than from any contempt of his
person, he resolved to try whether he could, with less open testimonies of his
Service, move her to be more sensible toward him; he went out in the depth of
night, with certain musical Instruments, the choicest his love and curiosity
could search out; and leaning to the Wall of Silvia's little habitation, he
began three Canzonets; praising, among other things, the perfections of her
Face; the great beauty of her Mouth, which was such, that it needed not the
help of her Eye to subdue the heart of any man alive: which he sung in Consort
with two other Musicians, his Servants:

I.
So looks the virgin-Rose,
Which cherished by the genial South;
Her crimson beauties does disclose,
As do the ruby-portals of her Mouth:
Which when she does unfold,
Two bright transparent rows
Of Pearly ye may behold;
From between which a breath of amber flows.
II.
AMore than Tyrian purple does o'respread
Her Lips, which softer are
Than the Swans Down, and smoother far:
The costly Juice that dwells
In Oriental shells,
To them looks pale, they are so purely red.
Fair Cheeks, that look like blushing Roses placed
In purest Ivorie;
Or Coral within Snow inchas'd:
The glories of the Spring
Grow pale, and languishing
For Envy, so cutshin'd by them to be.
III.
SWeetly triumphing Eyes,
That in two crystal Prisons do contain
Death in a frowns disguise:
How gladly would I die, to be by these eyes slain!
Delightful cruelty
Of those all-charming Eyes,
That have on me, designed to try
With what a pleasing Empire they can tyrannize.
Silvia diligently listening to this Song, knew that it was sung by the
Gentleman who had talked with her the night before; She was once about to have
opened the Window, to testify her grateful resentment of his civility, and
that it might appear her behavior was not so rustic as her habit; but
fearful, that if she should have been seen, it might have rendered her the
object of some malicious tongue that would perhaps have taken that advantage of
bringing her Honor in question, she held it fitter to forbear. There were in
Don Francisco those Excellencies, that she could not choose but be much taken
with his comely proportion of Body, his courtesy, and his discreet carriage:
besides the good opinion which his merit gained him in her heart, there
superven'd a certain natural inclination, which sprung from the agreeableness
of their humors: but being dejected at the consideration of her mean
parentage, she could not persuade her self that his Applications were real; and
therefore resolved to stifle in the birth this new-sprung Affection, which
notwithstanding had already taken too deep an impression to be easily effaced.

Don Osorio, on the other side, concluded himself disesteem'd, because he
thought she had slighted the Praises he had bestowed on her in his Serenade;
not comprehending, that out of a prudent reservedness she had dissembled her
true apprehensions: So that he returned to his Lodging in greater disquiet of
mind than (one would have thought) the soundness of his Judgment would have
permitted: he employed all the powers of his mind to fortify himself against
her disdain, and to enable him to overcome the violence of his passion; but he
strove against the stream: The likeliest way he had, was, to remove from that
place, wherein to have tarried, would have been to have proclaimed himself her
Lover; and to make that course, whereby he intended to manifest his Service, a
means to disoblige her; for he could not but be sensible that the habit he
appeared in at that time, would prove disadvantageous to him in his Addresses
to Silvia, which thereby became liable to a strict observation in such an
obscure Village.

Once he had in his mind to return to Madrid; but to that, the force of love,
and Silva's beauty, would by no means consent. In this languishing and
desperate condition, for a while, remained the enamored Osorio, restless in
his mind, and tossed to and fro between many contrary imaginations: At last he
advised with himself, (and resolved to put it to a trial) whether if he should
disguize himself, and change his habit, he might not become more acceptable to
her; supposing that it might be, perhaps, not so much the dislike of his
person, as the supposed disparity of estate, that might make her backward to
impart her Favors to him (for it is not safe to give way to the desiring of
that, of which there is little hope of ever attaining to) but thought that if
Silvia should behold him divested of his true quality, and clad in mean
Country-attire, she might happily show less aversion to him, descending to be
her equal, than she did before.

In this Resolution he slept, being resolved to leave no way unattempted, to
calm the inquietude of his thoughts. On the morrow, he called to him the
Goodman of the house, to whom he disclosed the Love he had for Silvia, and the
coldness wherewith she had hitherto treated him, in lieu of all the diligent
tenders of his Service: And withal, revealed to him the design which he had
pitched upon, for the subduing of her impassible heart; desiring him to add his
best advice and assistance for the furtherance of this his purpose; for which
he promised such a large reward, that he should be the better for it while he
lived. This he urged so passionately, and with such tender sighs, that the
Old Man, partly obliged with his promises, partly affected with the
sorrowfulness of his condition, faithfully promised, that on his part there
should be nothing omitted that might conduce to his advantage; and calling to
remembrance a Son of his, who, when he left his Country, was scarce arrived to
the Spring of his Age, of whom he had not heard any News, since his departure,
till that very day: He told him, He would give out that his Son was newly
arrived home, and that he might very opportunely make use of this pretense to
bring his wished design to effect.

Don Francisco exceedingly pleased, embraced the Old Man, and gave him a
thousand thanks for his happy invention; and imparting to his Companions the
intention of his disguize, he went for a while to Madrid, where fitting himself
with Clothes for the purpose, very near, though of the plain Country-fashion,
and changing his Name from Don Francisco to Cardenio; he returned one night to
the house of his new Father, who, against his coming, had divulged throughout
all the neighborhood the return of his own long look'd-for Son. All the
Friends and Neighbors came to see him, and gave him a thousand welcoms home.
Every one glad to see him so well improved, and become so brave a man through
the Experience of his Travels.

Cardenio began to be acquainted with the principal men of the place: he
knowing well the bounds of Courtesy, and what gallantry the meannesse of his
disguize would give him leave to use; so behaved himself toward all, that he
was envied of all, and yet attracted the goodwill of all. Thus lived he joyful
and contented with the happy success of his Enterprise; and underwent with a
great deal of willingness this homely kind of life; for he had every day
happy opportunities offered of seeing Silvia: he served her warily, and with
much zeal; taking advantage of his being newly come home, to visit her often;
which gave occasion to some curious pryers into other men's actions, (with which
sort of people all places abound) to say that Cardenio loved Silvia; that his
love was betrayed by his very eyes, which could not dissemble; and his
following her from place to place, as if he had been the shadow of her
brightness. She well observed the notice that was taken, and therefore carried
her self with the greater Caution; not that it was any new thing to her to be
Courted, but because she thought there was not any, anong all the
Country-Swains, more deserving her Favor, than Cardenio. She being of a most
prompt and acute wit, could easily discern the Graces and Endowments of him
that should be admitted to serve her; and having well considered the admirable
Attraits of this her new Servant, she could not choose but think him worthy of
her Love. (It is impossible that that thing should ever be absolutely
displeasing, which has once thoroughly pleased.) So that by little and little
she remitted much of her natural severity; discovering her mind fo far, as it
might plainly appear, That if she loved not, she at least was pleased with his
Service; which came to the same pass: for whosoever begins to be pleased with
any thing, takes no pleasure in despising it.

She looks now upon Cardenio as on her equal; saw her self loved by him, and
envied by many of the young Shepherdesses her Companions, who used in her
presence oft-times to load Cardenio with infinite praises; therefore she
thought she should have been guilty of a grievous offense, should she have
persecuted with disdain one that died for her. Many times would Silvia admit
these considerations to her mind, in respect of many who had formerly served
her. Seldom does a Woman lay to heart the sufferings of others, until she have
undergone the pangs of Love her self: now Silvia loves; and since she loves,
obliges Cardenio with many Favors. As she stood alone one night in her
Chamber, revolving these things in her mind, and Contemplating the perfections
of the feigned Shepherd; Her Old-father (for so Albanius had hitherto been
reputed by her) being informed of the Addresses that many had made to her to
obtain her Affection, especially Cardenio, whom he judged the same that he
feigned himself to be; and fearing lest she should unadvisedly run into some
misbeseeming action, or engage her self in a Match that would be inferior to
the nobleness of her descent; He related to her the story of her Parents
misfortunes, and the strange accidents of her Birth, which brought her into
this condition; And showing her some of the Letters which he had received from
her true Father, assured her, that she should be exalted, sooner than she
imagined, to a far more splendid manner of living than at present she enjoyed;
that it behooved her to bethink her self, and consider that the Actions of great
persons are more strictly censured, than those of the meaner sort: And that
since she was born with such great Endowments of Wit and Beauty, and above all,
such virtuous and discreet inclinations, he besought her not to admit of any
demeanor that might in the least wise dishonor the generous Blood of which
she was sprung; nor to hearken unto the Solicitations of every foolish admirer
of her, since none, thereabouts, could come near to deserve her.

With notable attention did the discreet Maid hear the sage Counsel of
Albanius, and the Secret of her Nativity; she gave full Credit to all that he
had related, and promised not to swerve from his Advice; remaining not less
troubled in her mind, than undeceived in her own esteem: the thoughts of
Cardenio 's deserts, came often into her mind, and the inequality of their
estates, which strictly commanded her to withold all her former Favors from
him; which her mind could not very easily consent unto: yet considering, That
to love him was to displease Albanius, and stain the greatness of her Birth,
she resolved with her self (although not without much regret) to forget that
ever she had the least appearance of love toward him, and to expect that day
wherein her Affections should meet with a subject agreeable to her quality.
Cardenio, upon a calm evening, looking toward the Walls of Albanius his Palace,
(for so of a Cottage the presence of Silvia had made it, in his esteem) he saw
her come forth, directing her walk toward a green flourishing Meadow, to pass
away with pleasure the tedious night, and to enjoy the benefit of those cool
Airs that gave life to the sweet Flowers in that cheerful season. Cardenio
following, surpised her unawares; but in such a manner, that he might be
perceived to have done it rather out of design than chance: Notwithstanding,
this disguized Diana kept on her pace toward the place intended; she seated her
self in a little Garden of Common Flowers, which Nature, without the help of
humane industry, had produced, assisted by a murmuring Rivolet that ran hard
by; and seriously revolving in her mind that which Albanius had the night
before related to her, not without much admiration at the strangeness of it;
she began to bewail her mishap; for that no sooner had she almost yielded up
her Affections to a Gentleman, whom for his Merits and his true Love to her,
she could not choose but very much esteem, but she was taken off by an opinion
of being far inferior to him in degree: and now that Cardenio being thought
her equal, had so far succeeded in his Service toward her, as to be thought
worthy of answerable Love and Respect, the late knowledge she had learned of her
noble Descent, interposed as an obstacle to their happiness, and forbids them
any farther progress. These thoughts drove her into such an ecstasy, and fixed
Cardenio so deeply in her mind, that her outward sense had not leisure to take
notice of him, though standing at a small distance from her: He on the other
side perceiving the disturbance of her thoughts, was willing to reveal the
Secrets of his heart some other way, than by directing his speech to her
herself. So taking on him not to have seen her, and giving truce a while to his
restless thoughts, he breathed forth this sweet amorous Sonnet.

1.
HIther I come, delightful Groves,
To spend my sighs, and make my moan;
To whose still shades it best behooves
To make my plaints and sorrows known:
And the gentle Trees invite
To pity my discons' late plight.
2.
It Is rigorous love that does torment
This disturbed heart of mine,
But of a Creature so divine,
That I ought not to repent
To have loved, though unlov'd again;
The sole Author of my pain.
3.
Is bright Silvia, gentle Bowers,
To your gloomy walks unknown?
Who loves to spend the harmless hours
Among silent Groves alone:
And can with her presence bright,
To the darkest shades give light.
4.
Silvia has about her, Charms,
Nations able to subdue:
And can conquer with those Arms
More than mightiest Kings can do.
But I that am her chiefest aim,
Am destined to the greatest flame.
5.
I die, Silvia, when I behold
Those Eyes that set on fire my heart;
Yet I (for love is uncontrol'd)
Greedy and fond of my own smart,
And Captive to my misery,
Love to behold those stars, and die.
So passionately was this sung by Cardenio, and so deep an impression took it,
in the heart of Silvia, that she resolved with her self not to return home,
until she had had some discourse with the Author of those melodious complaints.
Cardenio came forward, and seemed to be surpised himself with the suddenness
of meeting her in that place: she at first drew back, as intending to behave
her self toward him in a more reserved manner than she had done before Albanius
informed her of her true Condition; but she was shaken in her resolution, when
she saw him represented to her more full of Charms at that time, than ever; and
so much the more, by how much the less possibility she saw of enjoying him:
however, unavoidably they being met, she inquired of him (although though she
knew full well, that it was he himself, who had lately been the Orpheus of
those Woods, and that this Song was directed to her, having heard her name more
than once repeated in it, and could willingly have been contented to have heard
it many times iterated in so sweetly-mournful a Song) whether it were he that
had but even now so pathetically related to the Woods his amorous complaints?
He answered, that it was; and that the sorrows which he sustained through the
cruelty of her whom he served, had forced him to express himself in that
manner: Upon which words, Silvia offered to be gone, fearing to hear that which
might cause a more than ordinary Vermilion to rise in her Cheeks, and so
entangle her self more deeply in that from which she sought to fly: Cardenio
with little ado detained her, assuring her that if she would but be pleased to
hear what he had at present to say, it should be the utmost limit of her Favor
that he would aspire to; and having obtained her Consent, he began in this
manner: Had I thought, Silvia, that my Love would have offended you, either as
being a disparagement, or any other way distasteful to you; Heaven knows, I
would sooner with my own hands have ended this wretched life, than not to have
put an end to the occasion of your displeasure: but presuming upon the
confidence of a passion the most pure and innocent in the world, I did imagine
that the discovery of it could not be capable to offend you: yet hitherto I
have only taken the boldness to discharge my breast of those restless thoughts
that encumbered it, only by communicating them to the friendly secret of these
Trees, who I was sure would not divulge ought committed to their trust: Here I
stood, as you see, singing and bewailing (two things alike incident to those
that Love) and I conjecture that I have been overheard by you; therefore since
I am discovered, let it not, I beseech you, trouble you, but consider how
easily you may sustain the tediousness of being beloved, since I can pass
through the torment of loving. That you will love me, Silvia, is a thing I dare
not require; but beg of you, that you will not take it amiss that you are loved
by me: For alas! my love is of so small a value, that I have scarce courage
enough to persuade my self that I love you: and I shall comfort my self with
this consideration, That if my love shall want the satisfaction of your
Returns, it may at least be thought the more perfect, by continuing fervent
without the hopes of recompense.

Silvia's heart, formerly hardened with disdain, is now melted into pity by the
moving Speech of Cardenio: fain she would have been gone, but had not power to
go; but assisted with the spirit of no ordinary Woman, she put on a gallant
resolution, and parted, with this rigorous Answer, That he could have done no
more, if he had plainly told her, That he hated her. No sooner was she gone,
but she was ready to weep that she had left him; grieved that she must fly
from him, whom, of all the world, she most affected; and sorry that she had not
been kept ignorant of the nobleness of her Family. Ah Cardenio (said she,
oftentimes looking back) how willingly would I pay thee back the respect thou
bear me, were it not for blemishing the greatness of my Birth! O that I
could obtain of Heaven, to ennoble thee with a Condition equal to my self! how
willingly should I then sacrifice unto thee a heart, that is now scarce my own?

These Complaints had measured out a pretty distance of way from him, but with
such regret, that she was like to have made so bold with her modesty, as to
have returned back to hearten him whom she left so disconsolate, with the
evidence of more present Love, though smaller hopes of Love for the suture.
Cardenio, on the other side, would not turn back after her, for fear of adding
to her discontent, thinking she had been indeed thoroughly displeased: his
prudence made him distrustful; and by how much the more he loved, by so much
the more he feared; and by how much the more he feared, so much the more he
blinded himself with the opinion of Silvia's disfavour: but that which
aggravated his hard hap the more, was, to consider, That the disguising his
quality, did no whit avail to the altering of her resolution; for when he
appeared in his right shape, a true Gentleman, she was altogether averse: and
now that he had put on the Habit of a Country-Swain, she was as much offended,
although he could have been contented for her sake, to had led his life
perpetually in that obscure Equipage; and would willingly have renounced the
greatness of his Birth, that he might have enjoyed his adored Silvia. But to
comfort him a little in these disasters, he met with an object somewhat
sympathizing with his own Condition; for observing the Trees which grew
thereabout, among the rest, he chanced to cast his Eye upon one, of so russet a
hue, and so naked of Leaves, that it appeared among the other Trees like one in
disgrace, and as if Winter, banished from all the world beside, had there taken
up her habitation. Seeing therefore he had lighted upon so fit a Companion of
his Afflictions, with whom to communicate his griefs, he regardlesse, sung his
misfortunes in this manner.

1.
UNhappie Tree, who in thy greener years,
Have stood the shook of many a winters rage;
Now thou art free from either hopes or fears
Of sadder Fates to come, or these to assuage.
2.
Thou might have been the glory of this place,
Had not the rigor of untimely Fate
Robbed thy fair Branches of their verdant grace,
And thee reduced to this despised estate.
3.
Thou have outlived thy hopes, which are expired;
I linger out, and languish in despair:
Thy Joys are past, and therefore not desired;
But I the present scoffs of Fortune bear.
4.
How willingly in this calamity,
Yield I to act my self the chiefest part!
And yet I have a kind of fear to die;
As loath to be removed from this sweet smart.
5.
To thee, that season which on every thing
Except thee, smiles, is cruel and unkind;
To me that cruel fair, who is my spring,
More rigid is than the bleak Scythian wind,
Or Winters rugged blasts: yet do not I
Think strange, since to be cruel, is her property.
In the midst of these harmonious complaints, the night stole on, and Silvia
with steadfast attention stood all this while at her window, watching to see if
Cardenio would appear; which he did not, till having retired himself to his
Chamber, he had changed his Country-Habit, and instead thereof, put on the most
rich and splendid Garment of all those he brought along with him, in reserence
to whatever occasion might emerge: thus attired he came, when all others were
buried in night and silence, toward the Mansion of his cruel Silvia; who, what
with the extremity of the seasons heat, and the restlessenesse of her thoughts,
could not prevail with sleep to take possession of her eyes, that so her mind
might for a while have been diverted from those cares wherein it was involved.

Cardenio drew near, resolving to try a second change, to see if the altering
his Apparel for the better, would bring the like alteration to his Fortune.

Silvia all this while was standing at her window; and seeing him on a sudden
not to come forward, until he had by a sign fignified his desire to speak; She
straight consulted with her honor how she were best to demean her self toward
his request with the safety of her modesty and civility: which that she might
the more securely deliberate, she was about to have shut the Casement, but was
prevented by Cardenio, who besought her not fear that a few words from him (her
attention to which, would be but little loss of time) could have power to
convert her from that obdurate rigor wherein she was resolved to persist: and
without expecting her Answer, that he might not let slip the occasion which
offered it self, he continued his Speech in this manner:

I am (said he) fair Shepherdess, a Gentleman, who not leng since passing
through this place, chanced to espy that excellent beauty of yours, which made
you in my Opinion, scarce descend to be a mortal Woman. But I would I had been
born without eyes, that I might have been excused from the sight of that beauty
which has roh'd me of my repose, and the serenity of my life: my greatest
unhappiness was, for that having once seen you, I was pressed with an eager
desire of seeing you again; for what greater misfortune can there be, than by a
fatal constraint to chain ones Affection to a person, who returns nothing but
Coldness and Disdain? returning back to gaze on those Eyes which were the
source of my Afflictions, I found out a means, with much ado, to come to your
sight and speech; but I was entertained with such a frozen indifferency, that
my despair was without bounds or respite; yet I endeavored to suppress the
impetuosity of my flames, by frequenting the delightful divertisements of the
Court; and I had surely done it, had you been less fair, or that fairness less
predominant over my soul: but finding it impossible, ever to forget the charms
of those fatal looks which have inthral'd my reason and my quiet with
indissolvable fetters; I could not be at rest till I returned to the place
where I lost my Liberty, intending to make trial whether I might not be so much
the better accepted, by how much the more immediately, and with the greater
observance I applied myself to your compassion; putting my self in hope, that
if I did not find love, I should at least find a favorable respect toward
the sincerity of so devoted a heart. And now I attend the doom that I must
trust to, from your own mouth; and however it prove, whether contrary to what I
exsect, or not, it will yet be pleasure to me, to be convinced that I was
destined to become yours, although I have not merited to have the Honor to own
you for mine.

Silvia hearkened the more attentively, to see if by the listening to the words
of her seeming new Servant, she could forget Cardenio fancied in his old shape:
But as it often happens, that a Lover takes a special liking to the very actions
of the person loved; so she calling to remembrance the manner of his garb as
she fancied it in his other habit, would needs dislike the address he made in
this; as if the alteration of his Attire, had changed the Fashion of his Voice
or Action. It Is strange to see how humorous the passions of Lovers are:
Cardenio is he, who the night before parlied with her, and was inwardly
favored; and the self-same Cardenio, but even now, a Supplieant at her Feet,
and is rejected: then a Villager, and meanly clad; now a Gentleman, and having
on such Apparel as well beseem'd him that might presume to be her Servant. Who
would have thought, that she should now dislike him, when she had neither his
unworthiness, nor any other crime to object against him? Miraculous is the
mystery of Love; wherein nothing, be it never so commendable, is liked in a
person disfavoured; but in a loved object, all Errors are dispensed with. When
he was plain Cardenio, the homely Weeds he went in, robbed him of his Gentility,
and by consequence of her Favor: and now that his rich Attire discovered him a
Gentleman, and one deserving her Affection; the cause of his dis-esteem was,
that he seemed transformed from Cardenio to another man: and this seeming
alteration in him, had a greater ascendent upon her mind, than one would have
thought possible; so that in fine, making that the cause of her disgust, which
ought to have been her chiefest satisfaction, she gave him this resolute
Answer, That he need not trouble himself any further about her; for that,
besides the disproportion of his Estate to hers, he was to consider the nature
of the place; in which, being but a small Village, curiosity and slanderous
tongues abounded; every action, though with never so much integrity done, would
be liable to the grossest censure, and the effects of honest Love imputed to
lasciviousness: but that which most of all debarred him of all hopes of enjoying
her, was, that she had already parted with the right of disposing of her own
affections, which she had long since engaged; and, that two several Loves ought
not to harbor in one honest breast: therefore she desired him to pardon her;
and that if he loved her so truly as he professed, he would show it by not
coming again into those places where she used to be, lest is should be taken
notice of, to the calling her Fame in question: and so bidding him farewell, she
shut the Window. Cardenio remained so bitterly stung with this cruel Reply,
that he began almost to wish, that he had received his doom sooner, that he
might by this time have made an end of dying; thinking it more tolerable than
his present state; wherein, having so long lingered out his life in false hopes,
he was now to begin to die; he grieved, not only that she was so averse from
loving him, but that the pawning of her affections to another, was the cause
she treated him so rigorously; and, as if his rich Habit had been the sole
cause of his Grievances, he tore it to pieces, resolving to do penance in Rags
for his Offenses, although committed through error: he cursed his evil Fortune,
and wished earnestly to be disburthen'd of his wretched life, since in a manner
he was already slain by the cruelty of Silvia, that he lived but to the sense
of his Miseries, but was dead to all hopes: and seeing, that all the avenues to
her pity were shut against him, that to all his Prayers she was a Rock, because
she was uncivil and void of courtesy, not to be pleased with the most
obsequious Services, because she took a pride in being ungrateful; with bravery
of Apparel unmoved, as wanting courtly breeding; despising a homely garb, out
of high-mindedness; denying her heart to him, whose faith and constancy gave
him a just pretension to it, because she pretended that it was else where
bestowed: He bethought himself, that jealousy has oft-times wrought miracles
in the most wavering and obdurate minds, since a Woman is ever most apt to love
being slighted, and to slight when she is loved; and took on a resolution,
since his Truth and Simplicity so little availed, to betake himself to
Subtilty, as his last Refuge; purposing to try if he could discover, who this
fortunate Lover should be, that deserved to have the sole possession of
Silvia's heart: to effect which, an opportunity was soon offered. There dwelt
in the Neighborhood a young Shepherdess of a sprightly air, gentily educated,
rich, and not of the meanest Quality; she having observed the compleatness of
Cardenio, was many times so large in the Character of his worth, that it being
reported to him, gave him sufficient assurance, that it would have been no very
hard matter for him to have obtained her Love: so that Cardenio began not
obscurely to declare himself her Lover. She, proud to be courted by him,
counted her self happy in being thought worthy of his observance.

In his Letters he pretended much Love; but because it was feigned, he managed
his Expressions warily; and her Answers, though somewhat cunningly and coyly
framed, were yet courteous, and far from giving him any denial.

Silvia in the mean time, who had been so severe to her self, as to banish from
her self that person whom she held so dear, purchased with the price of her
health, the loss of that which she esteemed more than her health; so really
did she love, so really did she feign not to love; and was strangely divided
within her self, between this one, yet divided, passion; consulting whether it
were best to adhere to her real Love, or to turn her feigned hatred into real.
When she looked upon her self as Noble, she could not endure to think of
staining her Honor with the mixture of an ignoble Blood: when she looked upon
Cardenio as greatly meriting, she thought it impossible to draw out her poor
Pilgrimage of Life without him. In this plight, remained the unfortunately fair
Silvia, wavering in her mind between not daring to love him, and not having
the heart to resolve to slight him; when suddenly, the unwelcome fame of her
Lovers changed Affection arrived to her Ears; which struck such an amazement
into her heart, being careless of any other felicity than the enjoyment of
Cardenio, (though but in imagination) that her life had like to have forsaken
her, at the same instant that her jealousy possessed her: one while she
intended to punish his neglect, by changing her love into hatred; but was not
able to put in practice her design: for Love, although it be not easily
produced without the consent of our wills; yet being once sprung up in the
heart, and grown to maturity, it lies not in our wills to remove it: another
while, by coming where he might see her, to bring him to see his error; but
that she durst not, lest he professing love to another, her reputation might
have suffered by it: in fine, she held it best to conceal, as much as she
could, those torments, which the violence of her jealousy made her endure;
although it would have been a great ease to her mind to have discovered them;
whereas to keep them smothered in her breast, added much to the extremity of her
anguish.

One evening, a cool fresh gale of wind invited her to walk forth into the
Fields; and the rather, as being desirous to breath forth her grievances to
those quiet solitudes, and to communicate her sad thoughts to the pitiful
Birds; wishing they were endued with articulate voice, that they might relate
to Cardenio what she suffered; when casting her eyes toward the skirts of a
little Hill which served as a stately Crown to the bordering Plain, she saw
three men most injuriously set against the Life of one Person; who
notwithstanding gallantly defended himself; and recollecting all his Courage
together, he made a shift, what with the puissance of his blows, and what with
the advantage of place which he gained, and the skill wherewith he managed his
Weapon, to keep off that approaching Fate wherewith the dangerousnesse of that
assault threatened him: and to befriend him with her shades, the night came on
so fast, that, partly having the darkness of their fact represented before them
through the horror of the nights darkness; partly being sore wounded by the
valor of their Adversary, they sled away, leaving him as they thought dead, or
with small hopes of Life. Silvia came nigh, and saw clasped in the Arms of a
fair Shepherdess, this undaunted Combatant; who weltering in his own Blood,
gave to understand by the ghastlinesse of his look, that he wanted but little
of yielding himself up to death. Silvia being about to have demanded of them
the reason of this tragical accident; first observing the Maid, well perceived,
that it was her Corrival, and the Author of her Jealousies; and afterward,
looking intently upon the wounded man, knew him to be her false Lover, her
revolted Cardenio: so grievous was the sight unto her, so deeply did it strike
her heart, that she could almost have wished that his Soul would quite forsake
its unfaithful Mansion, both that she might be free from the pain of her
tormenting Jealousy; and that he might cease to be, since he ceased to be
constant; but leaving it to the will of Heaven, she suppressed her distemper as
well as she could, and condescended to ask the enemy of her quiet, what was the
cause of that tragical mischance? Who Answered with a troubled mind, and
weeping, That Cardenio, whom she passionately loved above all men, standing by
her under the shade of those Trees, had been assaulted by a man more fortunate
in Riches than well descended, who repining at the good success of his love,
being perhaps himself a Corrival, thought it a shame to suffer one that was a
mere stranger in that country, to go so much beyond him in the opinion of all
men, and to be an obstacle to him in the course of his Love; therefore he
sought all opportunities to work his mischief; and this night he found a means
to put in practice his cursed treachery: for seeing us walk forth to take the
Air, he followed privately, accompanied with two others, chosen for such a
villainous intent; and when we least dreamed of any such superchery attending
us, they all Three set upon him in that cruel manner; and, though I interposed
my self, to shield him from the fury of their Blows, have left his life in that
danger, wherein ye see it.

Silvia dissembling her ill resentment of the injury done her, (although her
heart was ready to burst with sorrow and vexation) advised the disconsolate
Maid, That it was necessary to have recourse forthwith to Justice, to accuse
the Authors of that villainy, and to demand satisfaction for so insufferable a
wrong, and to take some course for the dressing of his Wounds; remaining there
in the mean while her self alone, and yet accompanied with a thousand sad
thoughts: on the one side, her jealous rage instigated her to wish his death,
without whom she could not live: on the other side, her love and compassion
moved her to pity his sufferings; her love prevailing more to make her heart
tender, than her rage to harden it.

Cardenio listing up his eyes, beheld Silvia not far off; and seeing himself
free from the embraces of her, for whose sake he had undergone this bloody
Adventure, began to thank the cruelty of his Enemies, thinking that Silvia was
invited thither by pity; having forgotten, at least in that moment of time, her
natural severity: but when he remembered himself, that his Apostasy was known to
her, how secret soever she kept it, he then prayed that his wounds might prove
so mortal, as to cause his speedy deliverance from his loathed Life, and all
those Calamities that attended it: but seeing, that that great effusion of
blood from a wound in his head only, his other parts being protected by a
stiff Leather Jerkin, which he wore under his disgune, availed not to free him
from his misetable Life so soon as he desired, he vowed to be avenged on those
Assassinates for leaving him alive; imputing it to their malicious intentions
to procure his dying by degrees, that so he might linger out his Life in that
tormenting disquiet of mind, which arose from his being discovered to Silvia;
who, after she was satisfied, that those Vermilion streams gushed only from
the wound in his head; and, that that was not so dangerous neither, as was
imagined (although had it been less, such was her Love and pity to him, it
would deeply have pierced her heart) she wiped off with her hand some of the
congealed Blood that stuck upon his Face; and binding up that part of the head
from whence the Blood issued, with a linen cloth, questioned him concerning
this Adventure; telling him, She admired how having so fair a Creature by his
side, he could possibly receive any harm, were the opposition never so great;
and, that if she had seen her Lover in the like danger, she would have so
bestirred her self, that his Enemies should either have left him without hurt,
or first tried upon her the goodness of their Swords; which if they had
sheathed in her breast, she should have esteemed it rather a Favor than an
Injury, since she would have been freed thereby from becoming a spectator of
her Lover's harm.

It was to Cardenio a thing both strange and unexpected, that Silvia should be
sensible of his suffering; and made him a little revive his languishing hopes,
as knowing that Compassion is often the Harbinger of Love; and, that there is no
Love so sure, as that which springs from pity and to confirm the Truth of his
Persuasion, he repeated to her the same Story, which she so lately received
from the mouth of the amorous Shepherdess; although it is otherwise resented
by Silvia, being the second time told, than it was at first; the force of
jealousy being most impetuous, when it is first conceived; and her Spirit was
somewhat the more pacified, after he had so solemnly protested, That he was not
in love with the fair Shepherdess whom she saw, nor had made her any other
requital of the Affection she conceived toward him, than by general
demonstrations of Civility. For should he have professed to love her, it might
perhaps have proved as much to his disadvantage, as it redounded to his Credit
that he was beloved by her; it happening, that although many Women by how much
the more they are disdained, themore earnestly they love; yet others quite
contrary, the more they are slighted, the colder they grow in their Affections.
Silvia preceiving, that if she should not now at length disclose her mind to
Cardenio, it might urge him to go on in his new love; she thought it best to
make use of the time, while there was no Company to disturb her; forcing her
self to a faign'd laughter, (for had tears been needful, it had been needless
to faign) she began in this manner:

I swear to you, Cardenio, I cannot but be moved to Laughter, as often as I
consider how strangely the Opinions of Men do vary and contradict themselves,
in a short space; and, that being naturally unfix'd in your resolutions, and
born with unconstant minds, ye can have the face to be always accusing our Sex
of that inconstancy which is proper to your selves only, happily some women may
justly have been charged with inconstancy; but still there has been found on
your parts a sufficient cause to incite them to it: so that this defect arises
not from their own instability, but the provocations of Men. What blame can she
be obnoxious to, who, either injured in the point of Honor, or by whatever
miscarriage else offended, toward a false Pretender of Service, should strive
to forget all Respect intended to such a Man? How finely had I been served, had
I, out of a fond credulity presently submitted to your faign'd Adoration? Or
suppose some over-sensible Lady, overcome by the prevalency of her Love, and
the extreme importunity of her Lovers Tears, admits him to the highest place of
her esteem; and he having obtained what he so earnestly sought for, makes
himself absolute Master of her Heart, till satisfied with the easy fruition of
her Favors, he grow weary of them, and fall in love with the next Beauty he
meets; and, which is worse, never desists, till by making his perfidious
dealings apparent to her, he kills her with the sense of her own unhappiness:
I would fain know, Cardenio; may not this Woman be held excused, if she prove
inconstant to him? It seems we are obliged to suffer all vexations whatsoever
at your hands, and not so much as offer to be revenged for them; and your
selves not bound to be touched with the least shame for those injuries you do
us: you think the advantage of Wit, which you arrogate to your selves above our
Sex, was given you on purpose to delude us; and our less Prudence belike is
allowed us, only that we may be wise enough to bear with your failings: if
not, tell me, I conjure you, by that Respect which you once seemed to owe me,
and by the Beauty of that Maid that loves you so entirely, and could so easily
consent to sit, and look on, while you were in such danger of being slain; How
could you so easily forget those passionate pretensions, which you offered to
me with so much zeal and devotion? Did you not call to mind, how a few days
since, I saw you pitifully complaining, and recounting to the woods, whether
your real passions, or your forgeries, I know not? And afterward, did you not
with great aggravation of your griefs, urge how much you had endured for my
sake; and, that the Torments and restless Agitations of your Spirit, were all
the effects of my unkindness? Moreover, did you not make serious
Protestations to me, That should your life out-dure many Ages, it would never
be within your power to desist from loving me? How happens it, if this be true,
(as you are conscious to your self it is, and these very Trees can witness it)
That I found you even now incircled in the Arms of a new Mistress, whose love
you may highly prize, since it has been valued at the dear rate of so much
blood. Tell me, Cardenio, upon these terms, what considence is to be reposed in
Men that profess never so much Love and Fidelity? Or, what could you have done
more, if after the highest demonstratitions I could have given you of my Love,
you had been forsaken of me? Must you make such haste to discover to me the
falsenesse of your Faith, even before you had received the least assurance of a
favorable reception from me? are you so soon tired with those Supplications
which you so lately vowed should never have an end? Perhaps you suppossest your
self at Court, where between to request, and to grant, there is little or no
interval, unless it be sometimes the want of opportunity: or it may be you did
imagine me to be some Woman light of behavior; expecting, that I should have
rendered my self up to your first deceits, (for I know not under what other
title your words should pass) or if you have not entertained altogether so
sinister a conceit of me, could you have found in your heart, (if, as it is
possible I might, (although it has happened otherwise) being surpised with the
charms of your person or mind, I had offered my self up a Victim to your
impostures) to charge me with any blame, had I sought to right my self for this
injury, in publishing you to the world a perfidious, unthankful, and disloyal
Man? Be assured, Cardenio, that to offer any indignities to Ladies of honor
and esteem, is unsafe; for as they are always deeply affected with the sense
of received injuries, so they are apt to retaliate them, with a severity void
of pity or moderation: as for me, (since through the conduct of my good
fortune, I have evaded the snares of your false pretensions, through which I
might have suffered many inconveniences, and which perhaps might have beguiled
the credulity of many an innocent Maid) I shall advise you to consider, since
you take your self to be so discreet, that it behooved you to have less
confidence in your merits, and not to conceive you self arrived to that
perfection, as to be able to subdue the affections of every woman you have to
deal with: there are many defects in you, which you your self know not of,
because you look upon your self only through the mirror of your own Fancy.

She ended her Discourse with an action that signified much disdain; but yet so
gracefully she did it, that Cardenio was infinitely charmed with that which
extremely troubled him: yet his heart was somewhat lightened, to see that
Silvia, although she had not declared her love to him, (for the sharpness of
her expressions forbid him to hope a thing so much tending to his content and
happiness) yet had condescended to so large an expostulation with him; and the
better to satisfy her of his untainted fidelity toward her, and to let her
understand, that she had been the only Author of his inconstancy, he made her
this Reply:

Upon what ground it is, Silvia, that you so confidently aver an Universal
fickleness and ingratitude to be in all men, I know not, unless because I seem
to you to be such a one, you thence infer that all men are so. but Heaven
knows, you maintain an Argument, very difficult to be proved. There are many
things to be Disputed, ere your Opinion will gain belief. It is true, I was
seen by you making my Complaints, and relating my Grievances to these Woods;
and how well am I repaid for being so observant, even to a kind of deifying of
you, I have now to my sorrow understood: but that ever I had a thought to
relinquish or forget my first Love, so firmly devoted to you; I must both needs
deny it, nor is it a thing likely to have been, whatever your suspicions may
suggest into your mind; and I shall be very unhappy, until you shall become
sensible how much this confidence has hitherto deceived you: and I would to
Heaven, fair Silvia, since both to you it seems so indifferent, and to me it
would have been a means whereby the restless intranquillities of my mind
might have been somewhat allayed, that what you imagined had been true. You tell
me, You are very glad, (and seem to applaud your own Prudence in it) that you
consented neither to Credit nor to Love me, since you now perceive how ill
requited you should have been; and that you would have had just cause to repent
you of your Favors. Ah injurious Woman! what just cause can you have to
traduce the sincerity of my Love in such sort as you do? Grant that I am
inconstant, ought you not in charity to judge that I do it for the best, lest
in case your inclination be placed elsewhere, you should be offended with my
solicitations? I know, Silvia, that you love; I know that the pains of an
amorous passion sit heavy on your heart, and that from a very good Authority;
for there be who heard it from your own mouth. Seems it then, so great a crime
in me, to seek to allay the violence of my flames, and trifle away the
tediousness of time by the diversion of a counterfeit Love? Since I am denied
the satisfaction of your real Love, I cannot comprehend, how you should be
taken with such a qualm of pity, for a little Wound in my Head, having in the
mean while the Heart to bring my Life into danger, with a thousand more mortal
Wounds. Was it not enough, Silvia, that I loved you without being requited? Was
it not enough, that I was rejected by you? but that your Cruelty must needs
mock me with an imputation of inconstancy; your self in the mean time
continuing inflexible to a Passion the most pure and constant that any heart
could be capable of: consider with your self, how gloriously you have done, by
compelling me to languish out my sorrowful minutes in a despair, which nothing
but my Death can terminate. Seeing therefore, it imports so little with you,
whether I love you or no, suffer me to try, if by being able to forget you, I
can triumph over my own Memory.

Silvia very diligently (though somewhat disturbed at what he said) hearkened to
Cardenio's words; and going about to vindicate her self from that inhumanity,
which her severe Behavior toward him had caused in him to apprehend in her,
she was interrupted by a sudden refort of people thither, who hearing of that
unhappy Accident, came to inform themselves of the certainty of it: drawing
near, and viewing the Wound, they were glad when they saw it was not mortal
(nothing so much retarding his Recovery, as the want of Blood) and returned
back to the Village with him, where his mishap was universally bewailed; so
well his complaisant and civil demeanor had made him beloved among them: nor
could the Jealousy and Envy of a few, who had neither regard to Pity, Reason,
or Civility, be able to remove that good Esteem, so generally conceived of him.
His Weakness forced him to keep his Bed for some few days in which time, he
was carefully and tenderly looked to by Silvia; and apprehended with much Joy
and Pleasure, the many Favors which she conferred upon him; for which, to show
himself thankful, and confirm them the more sure unto him, he did that which he
knew would be acceptable to her. He wrote unto the Country-Maid, through whose
means his Love had been for a while withdrawn from Silvia, telling her, That
for his part, he was in that place rather a Stranger than a Native; that
although it were the place where his Infant-yeers were spent, yet long absence
had made him to become a Stranger; and that it was not convenient for him to do
any thing that might disoblige those with whom he was to lead the remainder of
his Life; for that, as he came thither only to see his Friends, so he intended
not there to continue. In fine, with these and the like pretenses he
dis-ingaged himself from her; giving her clearly to understand, that he meant
no longer to apply himself to her in the way of love.

Silvia received much joy and satisfaction from this resolution of Cardenio;
and sent by a Maid of the House in whom she reposed trust, to tell him, That as
soon as he found himself in a condition to come abroad, she desired to see him,
having many things to impart to him, which perhaps he would not be unwilling to
be made acquainted with.

Cardenio counted every Hour an Age, earnestly expecting that happy Day,
wherein he should have the opportunity to discover his mind freely to her, and
to prevail with her not to hold him in suspense any longer. Silvia on the other
side prayed heartily for his amendment; being fully resolved, at their next
meeting, to treat him less disdainfully and more obligingly than heretofore;
for that now the Love of him had so absolute an empire in her heart, that she
resolved with her self, in case her Parents should oppose her choice, as
thinking it a match too much beneath her, utterly to relinquish the Wealth and
Grandeur of her own condition, and to live with him, though in the most obscure
equipage: since no advancement or worldly interest had so powerful a
consideration with her, as her love of Cardenio.

One night among the rest, while the good old man, Albanius, having heard of
the correspondency between her and Cardenio, was beginning to reprove her, as
if she had not sufficiently given credit to what he had made known to her
concerning her Quality; there came to the door a man, who inquired for
Albanius, saying, That a Gentleman without desired to speak with him. Albanius
went down; Silvia in the mean time musing with her self about the resolution
she had taken in the behalf of Cardenio: as he was going toward the Gate, to
see who inquired for him, there met him a Lady of a handsome proportion, and
gentile presence, whom more by signs than her words, he understood to be the
Mother of Silvia; who plainly appearing to have inherited her Beauty, it was no
difficult matter for him who had seen Silvia, to discern this Lady to be her
Mother: as she was expressing her great Obligements to him by a thousand civil
Complements, came in her Husband, who greatly desiring to see his Daughter,
spent not the time in many Ceremonies, but entreated him forthwith to bring him
to the place where she was. So they all went up stayrs together, where they
found Silvia alone, and startled at their sudden surprising of her: after that
with many expressions of tenderness and affections on both sides, and after
they had solemnized with a great deal of Joy and Contentment, (and not without
some Admiration) their being so happily met together, and so unexpectedly; and
testified with infinite thanks, and large promises, their great obligations to
Albanio, for his eminent Humanity and Faithfulness: the mother of Silvia
related to him the most remarkable things that had befallen her since she
parted from him; telling him, that after she was returned to her friends, there
happened a disaster, which, for some years space, deprived her of the
satisfaction of her husbands society otherwise then by the mediation of
Letters: for he having killed a Gentleman in Salamanca, one of the most
principal of that place, was forced to retire himself to a remore place, where
he might be out of the reach of Justice, until such time as his Majesty should
be pleased to grant him a Pardon: the time of his banishment being expired, he
returned home to his Country and Friends, where he lived in great honor and
esteem, wanting neither riches, nor any other contentment, but the society of
her, without whom all other comforts were but distasteful; therefore, making
known his resolution to his friends, he came with all speed to Granada, to see
if my parents, having by this time remitted any thing of their rigorous
humors, would at length consent that I should be married to him; but found
nothing abated of their wonted severity. We seeing them still so obstinately
bent, resolved to steal away privately, one night, out of Granada, and to
betake our selves to Madrid, where we might undisturbed live together; and to
call here by the way, to take our daughter along with us.

Albanio, though he was somewhat unwilling to part with her, esteeming her, for
the many virtuous qualities she possessed, as dearly, as if she had been his
own daughter; yet seeing that there was no remeary, he told them, That whenever
they pleased, he was ready to resign up his interest in her to them. They
answered, that in regard the longer they stayed there, the greater their danger
would be, in case her Parents, missing her, should send after them, to bring
them back; it would be necessary to make as little delay as might be, and
therefore desired that Silvia might be ready to take her journey with them the
next morning by break of day.

This unexpected news of the necessity of her so sudden departure, affected
Silvia in such sort, as that she wished Heaven had been so favorable to her, as
that she might have been born to no other condition than that wherein she had
lived all this while; since the advancement of her Fortune tended to no less a
prejudice to her, than the depriving her of him whom she loved above all the
world; constraining them to live so far apart, that her eyes should henceforth
be debarred the dearest object of their sight. She labored all that in her lay,
to get repealed the rigorous sentence which was determined of her; sometimes
persuading their abode there, sometimes framing an excuse that she might be
left behind: but it little availed her; for her father and mother were induced
to persist in their determination, both by fear and love: fear, lest if they
should be pursued, their stay there might cause them to be taken; love, which
suffered them not to leave her behind, for whom they had so tender an
affection. So that, with a kind of unwilling consent, she at last submitted to
the pleasure of her parents: and when the very time of parting came, she, all
drowned in tears, and with a heart overwhelmed in grief, took her leave of
Albanio; entreating him, in the presence of that maid she relied so much in,
and made the confident of all her counsels, That out of the respect he always
bare her, he would certify Cardenio of the unexpected occasion of her sudden
departure from thence, without so much as bidding him Farewell. Albanio,
although seriously taking upon him the trust of this Injunction, and conjured
by all the ties of Friendship, besides his solemn promise, which in truth was
made, only to content her, and dismiss her with the greater consolation and
serenity of mind; yet when he considered, that to perform this message, was a
thing, however pleasing to her humor, yet conducing to her disparagement; he
judged it a friendly part in him to omit it. Silvia, (though accompanied with
so near Relations) while she was upon her Journey toward Madrid, you may
imagine in a most dejected posture, her eyes over-shadow'd with a melancholy so
obscure, as nothing but the sadness of her mind could equal; each step she
went, she thought upon him who was the Soul of her Thoughts; and as often as she
looked back, persuaded her self she saw him who was far enough off from her
real sight: but when her second Thoughts, like a true friend, dealt really with
her, and undeceived her Fancy, she began to be angry with her first
Imagination, for deluding her with false appearances.

In this juncture of time, was the mind of Cardenio agitated with a thousand
disquiet Thoughts, when he perceived, after his being recovered, and well able
to walk abroad, Silvia so regardlesse of the Meeting, which she her self had
appointed, to talk with him, as she sent him word, about many things that
concerned him, which by this time was more than expired; he had not long
remained in this suspense, when it was murmured abroad, That she was missing in
her Fathers house, (for so was Albanio reputed) and that she was privately gone
away with one who had lately professed love unto her: so usual a thing it is
with the vulgar, to report things otherwise than they really are, both by
perverting the truth it self, and by adding a hundred Fictions of their own
unto it.

Cardenio yet considered, That to have lent too easy a belief to the rash
surmises of the multitude, had been unworthy the Favors he received from
Silvia; and that to conclude ill of any Woman from a slight information only,
was to accuse her in point of Honor, and to show but a slender Opinion of her
Virtue: but when he saw that what was lately but whispered abroad, was now
become the general and loud talk of people; and had informed himself for a
certain, That she was not at Albanio's house; he then gave in his Suffrage to
the common voice of Fame; suspecting, that her appointing to meet him, at such
a certain time, was no other than a mere color, that she might have all that
entire to her self, for the more close carriage of her dark design, in
contriving a safe slight with the secret possessour of her beauty: he was
restless in every place, complained to Heaven, called upon death, railed, not
only against Silvia, but the whole Race of Womenkind; It happening frequently in
suchlike passions, that the whole Sex bears both the blame and the curse of one
Woman's miscarriage. Ah (said he, transported with fury) cruel Murderers,
pitilesse to those that love ye, kind to those that hate ye; who would not
desire to live from among you, to be free from your insolences and deceits? I
have always in my mind those words of Marcus Aurelius, where having occasion
to speak of your exorbitancies, he breaks out into this exclamation: O Women!
as often as I call to remembrance that I had my being from you, I am out of
conceit with life; and when I bethink me that I live among you, I long for
death. Aurelius spoke discreetly, and like a Philosopher, and one that had
experience; suffering at that time by the ingratitude of Faustina. Ye say that
we are inconstant, and I believe it; not that we out of any voluntary choice of
our own, are culpable herein; but it is conferred upon us by you, by reason of
that infection we draw from you before we come into the world: Ye are always
making Complaints, yet we always the offended party: as there is a hidden power
in your eyes, which forces men to pity; so your tears can always force credit
to your dissimulations: when ye speak of all men in general, ye bespatter our
Fames with some ignominious imputation; when of one man singly, he is sure to
be flattered or traduced. Ah Silvia! inconstant and unchaste Silvia! did not I
hear you one night so bitterly inveigh against all those that had any ignoble
or unworthy intentions, that I was compelled to think Lucretia revived, or that
another Penelope was come to live in the world? But I know too well, that this
was spoken by you, only to gain a plausible esteem among men: for as it is
incident to most, however vicious they be, to desire to be thought virtuous; so
especially to Women, be they never so wavering, the opinion of Constancy is not
unpleasing; they loving to be praised for that very good quality wherein they
are most defective. But indeed it cannot be imagined, that you should recede
from those qualities which are inherent to your Sex; yet with what confidence
could you, so unconstant your self, accuse me of fickleness, laying a kind of
Obligation upon me to believe that no Woman was ever Criminally false? and
indeed, who would have thought that your Love had not been very firm and
secure to me, that had but seen, how much ado you had to forbear weeping
through the force of your jealousy; if it were jealousy, and not much rather
Envy? perhaps it grieved you to see me apply my self to another, not so much
because you loved me, as because you could not endure that I should disesteem
you. Oh ungrateful! how ill am I repaid for those tender Observances wherewith
I have so often cast my self at your feet! For your sake did I abandon my
Country, my Friends, the garb wherein I lived: For your sake did I confine my
self to this solitary place; and degrading my self of the Honors of Court,
that I might be advanced in your esteem, I condescended to live with you in a
quality equal to what yours represented, and assumed the Habit of a
Country-Swain: Methinks these Caresses were worthy to have been acknowledged,
if not recompensed. But, Fool that I am, to require the mindfulnesse of
Benefits, from a breast so utterly incapable of being generous.

Thus did the misdeeming Cardenio, complain him of the conceived falsenesse of
his adored Silvia. But, had the truth been known, he had little reason; for she
loved him with that zeal and fidelity, that there past not a moment wherein he
was not passionately remembered of her: She on the other side thinking her self
forgotten of Cardenio (for mistakes are ever strongest at a distance) feared
lest he was grown remiss and cool in that Love which he both pretended to her,
and her Favors deserved from him.

Albanio using often to go to Madrid, she one time demanded of him, Whether he
had made Cardenio acquainted with her being there, and with those things she
spoke to him at her departure? He, to stop the Current of her Affections toward
him, Answered, that Yes: and that he had wearied himself with often asking,
Whether he would come to see her? But that he, his thoughts being confounded in
the labyrinth of a new Love, had scarce leisure to afford him an Answer.

Silvia gave too facile a credit to Albanio's untruths; and being much
prejudiced against Cardenio, she for his Crime, took sharp revenge of her own
fair eyes, putting them to a vast expense of tears. This happened about that time
when the Parents of Silvia were preparing to Celebrate their Nuptials; and she
having changed her Shepherdesses state for the gayetie of a splendid Court, the
luster of her natural Beauty, was heightened with all the advantages that Art
and Glory could add unto it; and had already subdued to her chains such
Captives as might have tempted the constancy of any Lady less virtuous than her
self. Cardenio having in vain long expected the performance of Silvia's
Agreement, he resented with so much rage her unfaithful breach of that
performance, that he had not patience to expect any longer; so that accusing
love for prompting him to such extravagancies, he quit his Shepherds crook, and
returned back to Madrid, to shine again in his own proper sphere of Gentilless
and Gallantry.

Not long after his return, chancing to walk out into a Meadow one evening,
accompanied with one Gentleman only, his Friend, one that loved to quarrel in
the night, and keep house in the daytime, they saw coming toward them a Lady,
who, both by her being alone, and by the distraction of her walking, gave them
to suspect, that some discontent or other disquieted her mind. She had upon
her head a Lion-coloured silken Vail, which cast so great an umbrage over her,
that it could not be discerned who she was; but the Skirt of her Gown overlay'd
with a costly imbroydery, induced them to think that she was a Lady, if not of
highest rank, yet at least of no mean degree: and coming toward her, they
assured her, That if ought lay in them wherein they could serve her, she might
command it. That you would both of you be pleased (answered the Lady) to follow
me, I entreat, not command: It concerns me (said she) to be avenged in the
highest measure upon a man who has offered so notorious a disgrace, that it is
enough to make me the subject of the Worlds laughter; nor can I be at quiet,
till this injury be rated at the price of his blood. They led her between them,
and walked several rounds about the Meadow; but could not find the Man they
looked for. As they were returning homewards, a Coach which stayed at the
Monastery of Espiritu sancto, wherein there were four Gentlemen, and four
Musicians singing very loud in parts, caused them to stay their course; and
that they might the more commodiously hear the Music, they seated themselves
upon the steps of the Church. After the Music had ceased, and the Coachman had
driven as far as the Fountains of St. Jeronimo, one of the Gallants within,
chancing to spy the Lady, bid him, Stay his Coach; and alighting, made toward
the Lady, to see who she was: Cardenio swelling with anger, withheld him from
seeing her, saying, That such a kind of rudeness was not allowed of at Court.
I esteem my self (answered the Gentleman) not so illbred, nor so little a
Courtier, as to have need of your advice how to behave my self; but Love,
especially backed with Jealousy, stands not upon nice punctillo's. The Lady in
your company (said he) is mine; and though taking some distaste at me, she seem
to forsake me, yet I claim her as my own. All that I am to take notice of,
(replied Cardenio) is, That she is at this time in my power, and cast her self
upon my protection; therefore it concerns me to defend her from the violence of
whoever shall pretend any right unto her. Thus there passed many Replies from
one side to the other; and the Gallants within the Coach somewhat the more
confident, because of their greater number, were not sparing in their taunts
and jeers. Cardenio and his Friend disdained to put up such sharp affronts; and
thinking it surer with Swords than words to decide the Controversy, began to
draw upon them. Of the two that Cardenio had to deal with, one, after a short
dispute, fell down at his seet, crying out that he was slain. No sooner was it
perceived that he was dispatched, but all the rest of them fled away, cautious
of the danger that might ensue, if the Law of Duel should be infringed; which
was, that as soon as any one man fell, the rest should desist from farther
violence, and retreat: Cardenio, only that he might not render himself
suspected, made no extraordinary haste away; but leaving that street where the
Quarrel was managed, took sanctuary in the next house he saw open; desiring the
Favor of those within, That he might there rest himself secure from the malice
of some that sought his mischief. A Servant of the house, who had been an
eyewitness how valiantly he behaved himself in the Combat, led him to an
innermost Chamber, (at one end of which, there was a Door which opened into the
Room where his Master and Mistress used to be) where he might remain concealed
from the search of Justice, in case he were pursued. Leaving him there, and
promising to afford him all the assistance he could, he locked the Chamber Door
upon him, and went forth to see if he could gather, by learning out how the
Report went of it about the Town, what this issue of the Fray was likely to
prove; that according as he heard of it, he might the better know how to advise
him for his safety.

Meanwhile Cardenio, left all alone and pensive, in an unknown obscure place,
had leisure to contemplate upon his adverse Fortune, and the mischances that
every moment attended him; but more especially, he reflected upon the many
troubles and inconveniences which Silvia's unfaithfulness had cost him: and
being about to counsel himself to forget the love that was so fruitless, and
had been so prejudicial to him; he heard from the next room the delicate sound
of a Woman's shrill Complaints, which interstop'd with many a heavy sigh and
groan, argued her the subject of some unspeakable grief: His curiosity to know
what it was, gave a breathing place to his own sad thoughts, and made him
deeply attentive to what she said.

Ay me (said she) what has this poor beauty of mine (if it be such as may
deserve that name) profited me? or rather, how much has it not injured me, by
betraying my heart to him that is so ungrateful, and treats me with so little
respect? To what end have I so long gloriously resisted his powerful entreaties
and inveiglements, when in the end I could not forbear surrendering my self to
him who has so ill requited me? What has it availed me to dissemble all this
while the ardency of my love to him, since at length I am come off with the
shame of yielding my self so quickly, and love without the recompense of bring
loved again. Oh Cardenio! who would have thought, That that Woman who
disprais'd thee more justly than she her self imagined, should so easily yield
her self a prey to thy false allurements? to persuade, thou art very Eloquent;
but how to show Gratitude. altogether inexpert; thy Words speak thee Noble, thy
Deeds act a Clown.

Cardenio, to hear his name mentioned in a strange place, was much amazed: yet
he imagined that happily some other bearing his Name, though not his Fortune,
might have been the occasion of this complaint.

By this time the Servant was returned, assuring him, that he was now at
liberty to go where he pleased: Justice being satisfied with the imprisonment
of one of the Adversaries. Cardenio gratifying the man with the expressions of
real Thanks for what he had done, and the reward of some Crowns; demanded the
Name of him he served? The Servant told him. It was a Gentleman that came
hither to be Married to a Lady, whom since he first loved, there are many years
now past, as appears by that sweet Pledge which they have brought along with
them; a fair Daughter, born in the infancy of their Love, not above three
leagues from Court, who till now, has in a mean Village always lived obscure,
and under the notion of a plain Country-Shepherdesse, until such time as her
Parents might with safety own her.

These things Cardenio hear, as it were transported out of himself with wonder,
to observe the strange Story of Silvia's Fortune; and turning to the Servant,
he said, Without doubt, this is the same Lady that I heard so tenderly
complaining to her self but even now. 'T is most likely to be her, (the Servant
replied:) for ever since she came to the City, she bath been noted for her
excessive sadness; eft breaking forth into such violent passions of grief, that
it is by most conceived, her melancholy arises from some strong affection left
behind her, which yet aetains her heart at Pinto: and although she created a
belief in most, that her perplexity was for the absence of those shepherdesses,
her companions, whom her long conversation with them, had very much endeared to
her affection; yet I, for my part, have some ground to think otherwise, because
many times I have heard her bitterly complaining of one whom she calls
Cardenio: therefore I presume it is not her love only of her absent
companions, that occasions this melancholy.

It was a Task sufficient for Cardenio, to suppress that excessive Joy he
conceived, hearing those happy tidings: but discreetly concealing it, he
entreated the man that he would, if it were possible, bear this Message from
him to the Lady, That a Gentleman who was an intimate Friend to Cardenio,
humbly desired her she would be pleased to give way that he might see her, and
present her with a Letter from him. The Servant, though at first somewhat
cautious to attempt the carrying of that Message to his Lady; yet obliged by
Cardenio's Gifts, and knowing that whatever strangeness she might dissemble at
first, she would quickly be persuaded to come to the speech of her Lover, went
confidently to Silvia, (who was now called Donna Violanta) and delivered his
Errant to her. Silvia was a little amazed; and the Conflict between her Love
and Honor, bred some Demurs: but incited by the unresistable force of Love,
she resolved to venture; and causing the door to be opened, she came into the
Chamber to him.

Great was the Astonishment on both sides, when they beheld one another in
habits so different from those wherein they were seen of one another last: you
would have thought they had felt the power of Medusa's head, and were become
Marble with admiring. Silvia was inwardly overjoyed, that she had in her
presence him whom she had given over for lost: but his changed apparel would
scarce permit her to give credit to her own eyes. Cardenio, on the other side,
seeing her so differently attired, could not tell what to think of it. As for
Silvia, she imagined, that without doubt, Cardenio having learned the certainty
of her quality, lest his supposed disparity should cause her to forgo her love,
had assumed to himself this Gentile garb; and so began largely to insist how
vain a thing it was to be taken with outward appearances; saying, that to go in
obscure or splendid Apparel, availed little, either to the confirming or
infringing of a well-grounded affection: and she did not so much dis-esteem a
mean habit, as she prized a rich mind; neither was a Rural courtship so
unpleasing to her, as a Courtly and Civil deportment was pleasing: nor did she
think it a shame for her to confess, that she would sooner choose to love that
man who was but of an obscure quality, and constant, than the most accomplished
Gallant, and perfidious. And thinking to take revenge on him for his
forgetfulness, she continued her discourse somewhat sharply, saying, That since
his meanness not so much dishonored her, as his unfaithfulness offended her,
she was not so greatly incensed toward him for being inferior to her in
condition, as because she saw him not correspondent to her in firmness and
sincerity of affection: however, in this, she comsorted her self, That she
hoped she should be able rather to endure and conceal her afflictions, nay even
to die, than to suffer her self any more to be inclinable to his false
pretensions; the experience of whose Ingratitude, might be a sufficient warning
to her.

More she had said, would her passion have given her leave: but what she left
unspoken, her eyes spoke for her: for the violence of her sorrow, not able to
be contained within her breast, burst forth in tears.

Cardenio was put to a strange nonplus, hearing the undeserved complaints
which Silvia made of his surmis'd neglect; whenas, from the very day that she
first forsook Pinto, he neither had received any message from her, nor could he
come to know, by means of Albanio, where her abode was. Wherefore he made her
this Answer: That as to the Ingratitude and Unworthiness she alleged against
him, such was his innocence, that it was needless for him to make any excuse;
and that he so far preferred her contentment before his own, that if she had
designed to bestow her Love upon some one more deserving, he would rather yield
to the hazarding his life, by seeing her in the power of some other man, whom
her affection might have made choice of, than seek to enjoy her himself, as
long as his happiness should be inconsistent with her repose: yet, that she
might be undeceived in the opinion she had both of his condition, and his want
of loyalty toward her; he told her, That whereas he had all this while gone
under the name of Cardenio, and the form of a Country-villager, he was both of
a quality Nobler than what he had hitherto professed, and his right name was
Don Osorio; and that (to make the credit of what he alleged the more
indisputable, it was sufficient to say, he was allied unto the House of Lemos;
and that it was he who passing one time through Pinto, and espying her, became a
captive to her beauty; and impatient till he had obtained the opportunity of an
address unto her, came one night into her company, though through the nights
obscurity, he was scarce able to discern her: but that afterward, to gain
frequent oportunities of seeing her, and to have time to make his passion
known, by the most zealous services he could be capable of rendering to her, he
had put on that same Country-disguise, in which he so often appeared to her: and
that however she was pleased to inveigh against his neglect of her, he had ever
remained a Rock in that sincerity he first professed; and at that very time
when it was rumored abroad that she was missing from Albanio's house, he was
exceedingly perplexed about it, seeing all men whisper and entertain odd
conceits about it: but when neither from Albanio, nor any one else, he could
receive the certainty of what was the occasion of her departure, nor whither
she was removed; he thought it needless to stay any longer here, and so
returned back to Court; and walking forth one evening with a friend, he chanced
to be engaged in a Quarrel, in which one of the adversaries fell; and that he
fleeing from the severity of Justice, was by his good Genius happily directed
to this house, where hearing his name repeated among many sighs and complaints,
he came to be informed of the whole Story of her proceedings; and, that he
remained absolutely devoted to her command, resolving not to dispose of himself
in any way that should not submit to her concernments, or afford him the
opportunities of having the honor to serve her: and that she might the better
satisfy her self of the reality of his affection, he prayed her to consider
that he had not altogetherdeclin'd the acting of what might in some sort
pretend to her esteem; having divested himself of his own Quality for her sake,
whom he absolutely concluded to be his inferior: whereas she on the other
side, since the late change of her Fortune, had out of the same consideration,
sought to retract her long-profess'd Love. To which she answered, That
notwithstanding the Reverend old Man, who in her esteem had ever had the place
of a Father, had long since revealed to her whose child she was, and withal
strictly admonished her, that having regard to her Modesty and Honor, she
should not entertain any one beneath her in degree; yet that she remained
constant and unmoved in that Affection, which took beginning in her, from that
night forward, wherein he having obtained an opportunity of addressing himself
to her, made so large professions of his Love. And that he might see how much
the reality of her Love prevailed above the thought of her Quality, she gave
him a Letter to read which she had written at Pinto, thinking to have left it
behind her, to be sent him by Albanio, as a testimony of her constancy: the
Letter Cardenio read, it being to this effect.

Violanta to Cardenio.
If with the change of my Habit and Fortune, I had changed that Love which I
have so long borne you, I might seem to have done that which the respect of
Blood and greatness obliged me to; but so far am I from the least thought of
forsaking you, that I was never more firmly than now, resolved to be wholly
yours: he that gives you this, will give you an account of my condition, and
the reason of my departure. Rest happy, and assured, that though at present the
distance between our qualities be as great as that which separates our selves,
my Love shall make you Noble, and render you worthy of my Nuptials.

Violanta.


Cardenio had no longer what to doubt, nor Silvia what to fear: that night he
kept in the same Lodging, Silvia's care not permitting him, for fear of
whatsoever danger might befall him, to stir out of the House. The next morning
she went to her Father and Mother, acquainted them with the whole proceedings
of their loves, and all the circumstances that had happened: they making it their
own case, having so fresh in Memory the powerful effects of Love in themselves;
wisely considering, That to cross a Woman in her desires, is to drive her into
remediless inconveniences; her Father also knowing Cardenio to be a man highly
esteemed of in Court, for his great Quality and his complete Virtues, they gave
their free consent that they should be married. About the same time, it
fortuned that their Parents also came from Granada to Madrid; who when they
saw, that their Daughter matched to so noble a Gentleman, and the Fruits of
their lawful Loves appearing in so beautiful a Pledge, whom, not without great
admiration they beheld, they were so far from continuing their former
averseness, knowing it in vain to repine against that which Heaven has decreed
should come to pass, that they changed their displeasure into content, their
anger into gladness. Cardenio enjoyed his beloved Silvia: and the strangeness
of their Loves adventure, being published through the Court, their Nuptials
were solemnized with a great deal of Joy; all Men applauding the happiness of
Cardenio, and the Divine Beauty of Silvia, now a principal Lady of the Court,
who was lately a mean Shepherdess of Pinto.
