Here is something following of a VISION And a few words of Prophecy
concerning the fall of BABYLON, And destruction of her People, this signifies
the time at hand, therefore I warn all in the fear of the Lord to turn from the
evil of their ways.
The 4th. of the 7th. month 1663.
ABout the tenth hour in the morning, as I was at my Employments, the glory of
the Lord God shined round about me, and I was taken so with the glory of God,
that I beheld no other thing, and in that I laid me down a little while flat
upon the floor, and after a little time, I saw beneath this, a great Pit, out
of which there arose a mighty great smoke, and all the Inhabitants of the earth
was even ready to join hand in hand together, and out of the Pit arose a
mighty great power, after which power the Inhabitants of the earth went forth,
and followed it to their destruction: So this is a great day that the glory of
the Lord does so gloriously appear, that it even covers the whole earth, and
as this day is great and the glory of it is greater, so as no mortal eyes can
behold it, so will the days be that is coming upon the earth, when this glory
shall be hid in God from the eyes of all men: then shall woe, lamentations and
wailings be upon all people who refuses to receive the Lord of glory in this
his day, for this is a day that he profers himself to dwell with the Sons and
daughters of men, and this is to all you who refuse to receive the Lord of life
and glory, a great day of gloominess and thick darkness is ready to come over
you, then O your wailing, O your mourning, and O your lamentations, that you
had made better use of the days and time that you had upon the earth, when the
Lord Christ Jesus preached himself in your streets, and in your highways in
and through his Servants and handmaids, whom he had made choice of to preach
the everlasting Gospel of glad tidings; but you would not believe though the
noise of wisdom was often heard in your streets, Market places and Steeple
houses, now what pity and compassion shall I take over you O you Sons and
daughters of Adam, Oh my bowels within me is filled with pity and compassion
that you would yet return whiles there is a little space and a little time
before the glory withdraw it self from you.

This I was made to do some days after I saw this thing. From a Lover of
Truth, Lewis Rogers.

A Salutation, and Revelation of God, unto His seed, Concerning his People
which he has chosen unto himself.
THis has often been sounded in my heart, and many deep and serious queries
have there been made by the spirit of life in my heart, and now has the Lord
answered, and now with force and commission from the Lord, am I made to publish
it and declare it and to sound it forth: This has the Lord often spoken
concerning his people, you are mine says the Lord, and I will be your God for
ever, and you will I keep hide and preserve in the day that is coming, I will
cover you, yea I will hide you from the eyes of all that rise up in opposition
against you, for verily you are mine says the Lord, and I have wooed you unto
my self and I will be your God for ever therefore fear not O ye little flock,
yea I say fear not, yea it is the Fathers will to suffer this day to come to
pass, but he will preserve ye and safe keep ye in the day which is hasting. O
dear Lambs, lift up your heads and rejoice, for the glorious day of Sions King
is come, and he has adorned himself with glory and beauty, and he is going
forth to gather unto himself all that will be saved, therefore Oh rejoice and
be exceeding glad, for the glory of the Lord is come into Sion yea verily the
glory of the Lord is appearing and is revealing and manifesting it self,
therefore ye dear lambs and babes of the heavenly Father, whom God has called,
and chosen to himself, to bear his name amongst a crooked and perverse
generation, in that I say rejoice and be exceeding glad, that you are found
worthy to bear the name of the Lord in this his great and mighty day, for
verily a great and mighty day is coming, yea verily the Lord has spoken it in
my heart, and I dare do no other then to publish it, yea a day of great joy to
the righteous, but a day of fury and indignation unto the wicked, and all that
deals treacherously with the Lord, for it is such a day that has not been
known in many ages or generations past, which now the Lord is revealing, but
yet the wicked will not believe, but unto you its given to believe the mystery
of the kingdom, you I say who are called and chosen of the Lord, and are come
to believe in the light of the Covenant of life, Christ Jesus, whom the father
has revealed and is revealing in this his day of great and mighty power, by
which power the earth shall be shaken and the heavens shall melt, and all shall
be astonished and amazed at the work which the Lord is bringing to ^ou, yea the
Heathen shall know that they are my people, and I will destroy all that rise up
against them says the Lord, yea all nations shall know that they are my people
and that I will preserve them unto my self: Therefore in vain does the Heathen
rage, and the people imagine vain things, for its I the Lord that will work a
work in your days, that you will in no wise believe, though an Angel from
heaven did bring the message unto you, but this am I doing I am destroying
Babylon, and building up the Tower of Sion and it shall stand for ever,
therefore in vain do you work, O ye foolish Potsheards of the earth, for it is
I the Lord that is a working a great and wondrous work for the deliverance of
my people Israel, and the redemption of Sion; for I will in no wise suffer you
to destroy them from off the earth sor they are mine says the Lord, who has
the zeal and testimony of Jesus in their hearts, and the word of Prophecy in
their mouths, these are them which I will keep and preserve to the end, to the
utter ruin and destruction of all that rise up against them: So dear friends
be all bold and valiant in Gods cause, in bearing your testimony here upon
earth for Jesus, whom ye have received, yea friends I say let noneneglect, for
this says the spirit, be ye all bold and valiant, yea be bold in this Gods day
in fighting Gods battle on earth, yea I say not with carnal weapons, but in
spirit and in truth, preaching forth the coming of Jesus in your lives and
conversations, and the generations to come will glorify God on your behalf; so
this is my message unto you all, in the fear and dread of the everlasting God
of heaven and earth dwell all in the power of the Lamb of life and dread him
over all, yea dread him over all who is come and coming to reign and rule upon
earth in the hearts of the children of men, him I say fear, and dread his holy
name, and fear not man whose breath is in his nostrils, but fear the Lord ye
dear lambs and babes of the heavenly father, This is my Salutation unto you all
as being one with you in the Spirit and life which is not of this world, dwell
in the spirit and power which has begotten you, and the Lord of power will be
with you and keep you and preserve you to the end. So dear and precious Friends
the peace of the Lord be with you all, continue and abide for ever, so farwell.
