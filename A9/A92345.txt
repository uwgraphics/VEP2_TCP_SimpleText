his LADY.

With two Letters from the French King, one to the Pope, another to the
Cardinal concerning the same.

LONDON, Printed in the Year. 1662.

The true Translation of what passed at the assassinate Enterprise against the
French Ambassador and his Lady at Rome the twentieth of August last.
FOrasmuch as for some time immediately after a tumultuous disorder, all the
discourses thereof are usually confused: It is necessary (if I may so speak) to
let the news rest a little, that so it may have time to purify it self; and
seeing it is not easy, in the heat of an accident newly happened, that the
first relations should be most true in all their circumstances; it is from the
seconds that we must draw the certain discoveries; the knowledge of which truth
having obliged the Duke of Crequin, Ambassador extraordinary for the King of
France at Rome, to make careful inquisition, in what manner all things passed
in that Enterprise that was there acted; the roll past against him and the
Embassadrix his Wife: after an exact examination of all that has been said
thereof, by those of each party, two things have been observed; one, that many
particulars of small concernment happened somewhat different to what was first
written, which is very ordinary in such rencounters; the other, that by many
circumstances the business was yet more enormous then was at first advised,
which is a thing unusual; the first rumor for the most part heightning and
aggravating things above what they really are: to the end therefore that you
may not want the very exactness in a business of this nature, it is thought fit
to write this second relation, whereby the Reader, without doubt, will be
astonished to see that in a City where the Spirit of peace should rejoice,
there has been done contrary to the inviolable security of the public faith,
and right of Nations, an action so unheard of, that endeavors have been to
assassinate in Rome persons whose quality is owned for sacred even in
Constantinople it self; and that in the place where the head of the Church
resides, there has been committed against the eldest Son of the Church, in the
person of his Ambassador, an attempt whereof there has not been any example
amongst the very Infidels.

On Sunday the twentieth of August about six of the clock at night, four men,
which yet are unknown whether they were French men or not, and four Soldiers
Corses, having quarrelled together at the end of the Bridge called Pente septe,
and having drawn their Swords, were presently parted by a Frenchman, who came
by, and caused them to put up their Swords into their sheaths. In this posture
they went on upon the Bridge, where being about the middle of the Bridge, there
came to them eight or ten other Soldiers, who joining with the four first,
fell upon the five pretended Frenchmen, who presently putting themselves on
their defense, forced their passage over the Bridge in despite of the
Soldiers, and withdrew themselves hard by the Ambassadors stables. Some of
the Ambassadors household Servants, with some of the Grooms, going out at the
noise, and seeing people pursued with drawn Swords, beat back the Soldiers;
but a great number coming, the Ambassadors people were driven back with
musket shot, even within the gate of the Palace Farnese, where he dwelt. There
was hardly then six persons in the house, the most part of his Gentlemen being
gone abroad to walk, or to Duke Cesarini's, who had invited them to supper; the
Ambassadrix being gone to her devotion at St. Bernard, and the Ambassador also
gone forth to see the Princess Borghese: Returning from whom, having taken
leave of those that accompanied him, he came back with a very small train to
his house, and went in on one side just at the same time as the Soldiers had
beaten in his men on the other: As soon as he understood what past, he sent two
or three Gentlemen to cause them to withdraw; and they were no sooner out for
this purpose, but seven or eight bullets were shot at them; then, as if the
signal had been given, all the retainers to the Palace were seized on by the
Corses, who came thither with drums beating, and placed thereabouts in a moment
eight or ten Courts of guard: The Ambassador at the news thereof went up into
a Balcony, and presently they discharged many shots at him, whereof one killed
an Italian under the windows of the Palace; and after, for the space of an
hour and an half, they ceased not to shoot from all parts, whereof there are
yet many marks on all sides of the Chambers. In the mean time, in all other
parts of the City, the Soldiers likewise put themselves in Arms, crying that
the Horse should advance to charge the French, amongst whom three Gentlemen of
the Ambassadors, having been set upon near the Palace that is called
d'Espagne, half a league from thence, had been killed, if they had not saved
themselves at the Cardinals of Arragon.

But it was not the Soldiers only that took Arms; the Sbirres or Sergeants
themselves, to show that all was done by express order, armed themselves also;
and they which never shot on any occasion whatever, wounded in the place
Navone, a Gentleman of the Ambassadors with a Musket in the belly; one of his
Lacquies on the other side received a shot in his body, whereof he is dead; and
his Palace remained beset near three hours, without permitting any person to
stir. The Ambassadrix her self coming from Church, and being yet far off from
her house, was stopped near Saint Charles de Getinari; but it is too little to
say she was stopped, seeing they endeavored to kill her; the Soldiers that kept
that post, having let pass the Coach of her Gentlemen, discharged several shot
at hers, killed a Page in the boot by her an Italian, who a little before
believing himself safe by the Coach of the Ambassadrix of France, had advanced
himself; out of curiosity to see her, was woundedd besides another of her
Lacquies with a Crosse-bow shot upon the head. It is so amazing a deed, that
one could not have dreamt that there should have been thoughts of such an
attempt on the person of an Ambassador and his Lady; one is even loath to speak
it; but who can be silent, when on the one side we see her assassinated in this
manner; and on the other, it is evident, that they shot at him, and that it is
since said, there were seventeen Conses who had order to kill him! The
Ambassadrix was constrained to divert half dead, and to save her self at the
Cardinal d' Estes, where seeing there was no safety for her to go forth, she
stayed a long time, and till she was reduced to capitulate with the Sergeants
to let her pass. The Cardinal conducted her home himself, marching in his
Chair just before her Coach.

Behold here a true Narration of the thing as it passed, whereof the
Ambassadors that were at Rome, and all Persons of honor uninteressed, can
freely bear witness. Notwithstanding after this offense done to a King in the
Person of his Ambassador, which cannot be expiated but by very great
satisfactions, the Court of Rome has used no endeavors to make any; yea she
endeavors presently to palliate the business by Artifices and Disguisements;
and publicly in a little time she will take the confidence to go further, and
to seek Reasons to justify it; but his Majesty has this advantage, that if
they do not give him the satisfaction which is due to him, and which he may
expect, he is in a capacity to right himself.

Two letters of the King; One to the Pope; the other to the Cardinals; both
dated 30. August, 1662.
Most Holy Father,
OUr very Dear and Well-beloved Cousin the Duke of Crequi our Extraordinary
Ambassador, having given us to understand the assassinat committed on his
person, and on Our Ambassadrix, and all the French, which were found the 20
Instant in the streets of Rome, at the meeting of your Holiness guard of
Corses: We have presently sent order to our said Cousin to depart out of the
Ecclesiastical Territories, to the end that his Person, and our Dignity may not
longer remain exposed to such attempts, whereof to this day, there has been no
examples amongst the very Barbarians; and we have at the same time ordered Mr.
De Barlemont Auditor of the Rote to know of your Holiness, if you approve of
what your Soldiers have done, and whether you intend or not to make us
satisfaction proportionable to the greatness of the offense, which has not
only violated, but unworthily overthrown the right of Nations. We demand
nothing of your Holiness in this affair; you have made it so long a custom to
refuse us every thing, and have demonstrated to this day such aversion, to that
which respects our Person and Crown, that we judge it better to leave these
resolution to your own prudence, according to which we shall regulate ours;
wishing only that those of your Holiness may be such as may oblige us to
continue to pray to God, that he would conserved (most Holy Father) your
Holiness in the Government of our Mother the Holy Church.

MY Cousin, the assassinat committed the 20 instant, on the person of my Cousin
the Duke of Crequi my Ambassador extraordinary, on his Lady, and on all the
French, the Corse grand of the Pope could meet with that day in the streets of
Rome, is addeed so enormous in all its circumstances, that neither any age, nor
any people, how barbarous soever they have been, can furnish any example, when
the right of nations has been so so inhumanly violated and overturned. As you
are a worthy member of that holy body, which is the natural counsel of the
Popes, I have commanded Mr. De Barlemont Auditor of Rote to visit you on this
account, to let you know the just resentment that I have of so great an
offense, to the end that your contributing thereto, as I doubt not but you will
readily do what is in your power, may cause me to obtain a reparation
proportionable to the process of the injury; if your Officers find themselves
unable for this, there can be nothing (after this diligence) imputed to me of
all those evils, and following mischi^ses that this business will draw after
it, whereof I will protest (what ever happens) to be fully discharged before
God and men; and referring, my self to what further shall be represented to you
by word of mouth, by the said Mr. De Bourlemout, I pray God to have you my
Cousin, in his Holy and Worthy protection.

Written from St. Germain.
FINIS.
