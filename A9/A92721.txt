SCOTLAND'S LAMENT FOR Their MISFORTUNES.
PRay listen and hear of the sad state
has hapened to SCOTLAND of late
And this my part which I Have begun,
will now declare their Misfortune.
And truly this is very sad,
enough to make a wise Man mad,
These bypast Years have been so bad,
there is Thousands dyed for lake of Bread.
As yet it is not like to end,
till we the People do amend:
If an Indian Trade we do attemp,
likewise of Sin let as Repent.
At first by it we could do no good,
not being assisted by our GOD;
We Have lost our Men, and our Money,
our Provender, and Ships at Sea,
Tho it be so it is no Wonder,
for the great Sin which we ly under,
Of good Religion we make a show,
but oh! alace! it is not true.
Many Words we do make up on heap,
which makes us like the Hypocrite,
They are not in Sincetiry,
alace! too like the Pharisee;
Yet if in Goodness we do augment,
our GOD is good, and will Repent,
He Will give us Success to our Trade,
that we our Enemies may invade,
A hard beginning is the best,
and will our good Friend prove at last.
Let us take Courage still yet more,
for whom HE Loves HE chastens sore.
Therefore our Trade we need not fear,
these are good News, that we do hear,
The safety of the Rising-Sun,
to inhabit Darien will go on;
Let us take Courage and be glade,
hoping to have a gallant Trade:
But if we still Rebels Remain,
against our Master to Conspire,
He will then come as with a Train,
and set our Houses all on fire.
As in Edinburgh that Gallant City,
(Saving His will) had been great pity.
Into the Year seven Hundred,
this sad Misfortune happened,
In February the third day,
the incroaching fire did mount so high,
That the best Buildings in the Town,
by force of it were pulled down,
These brave Buildings, that were so high,
the like was not in that Kingdoms three.
Full Fifteen Stories high or so,
yet by the Fire they are brought low,
Which caused many one to mourn,
Two Hundred Families there did burn.
Now the same Quarter of the Town,
thrice by the Fire has been pulled down;
We may receive it as a Wedge,
for the horrid Sin Sacraledge,
And other sins which GOD does move,
to afflict his People, them to prove,
Such as Pride, whose Patron's Hell,
whose Father is the Devil himself,
To break the Sabbath is a shame,
to Whore, and Drink, and to Blaspheme,
To Cheat and lie, to Steel and Rive,
this age abounds wherein we live;
Therefore let us Repent with speed,
for sure there never was more need.
For these his Threatenings on us all,
we may receive them as a call,
And make Confession of our Sins,
which all these Evils on us brings,
Over the same daily to Mourn,
least that into Hell's Fire we burn.
