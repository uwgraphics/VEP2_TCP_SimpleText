In respect of the troubles of the times, the means of the said Hospital has
very much failed for want of charitable Benevolences, which formerly have been
given, and are now ceased, and very few Legacies are now given to Hospitals,
the Rents and Revenues thereunto belonging, being also very ill paid by the
Tenants, who are not able to hold their Leases, by reason of their Quartering
and Billetting of Soldiers, and the taking away of their Corn and Cattle
from them; And likewise, the said Children are not now permitted to do their
service at Burials as formerly, which was a good help toward their relief;
Besides the want of bringing Cloth and other Manufactures to London, formerly
brought to Blackwel-Hall Market, the Hallage whereof was a great part of the
poor Childrens maintenance; which being decayed, by these and other means,
the said Hospital has not been able to take in any Children for three years
past, having a greater number already upon their charge, than they are any way
able to maintain.

THere has been Cured this year last past, at the Charge of S. Bartholomewes
Hospital, of maimed Soldiers, and other diseased persons, to to the number of
-- 796

Most whereof being Soldiers, have been relieved with money, and other
necessaries at their departure.

Remaining under Cure at this present, at the Charge of the said Hospital --

THere has been brought to the Hospital of Bridewell, within the space of
one whole year last past, of Cavaliers and wandering Soldiers, and other
vagrant people, to the number of -- 793

Many whereof have been very chargeable to the said Hospital, for Apparel,
sick diet, and Surgery, besides their ordinary diet, and other provisions and
charges expended about them, which could not be avoided by reason of their
necessities; and many of them have been passed into their Countries, with
Clothing and Apparel to cover their nakedness, which could not be avoided
considering their miseries, nor they thence passed without such charge. And
there are now kept and maintained, in Arts and Occupations, and other several
works and labors, at the charge of the said Hospital, Apprentices and other
persons, to the number of -- 148

The Hospital of Bethlem is of great Antiquity, use, and necessity, for
keeping and Curing distracted persons, who are of all other the most miserable,
by reason of their wants, both for soul and body, and have no sense thereof.

That the charge thereof is very great, there being kept and maintained with
Physic, Diet, and other relief, 43 distracted persons constantly at least,
and the Rents and Revenues thereof very small, not amounting to two third parts
of the yearly charge, and therefore is a fit object of Charity, there having
been of late by the blessing of God, upon the charge of the said Hospital,
and the care of those that are entrusted with the said distracted people,
diverse reduced to their former senses.
