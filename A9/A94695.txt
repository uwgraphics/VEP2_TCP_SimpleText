London, in Common Council assembled.

Printed by James Flesher, Printer to the Honorable City of London. 1653.

TO THE Supreme Authority of the Nation, THE PARLIAMENT OF The Commonwealth of
ENGLAND.
The humble Petition of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of
London in Common Council assembled.
Shows,
THAT your Petitioners do in all humility, and thankfulness acknowledge the
infinite goodness of God to this Nation, in the free passage of the Gospel for
near one hundred years together; and the Peace, Plenty, and Prosperity that it
has brought with it: and that all along God has raised up Pious, Learned, and
Painful Preachers of the Gospel, whose labors God has blessed in the
converting of Thousands, and defending of the truth against Popery, Errors, and
Heresies, although very much opposed and persecuted by a Popish, Prelaticall
Party.

Your Petitioners do likewise acknowledge (amongst many worthy things done by
the late Parliament) the tender care they had of all able, faithfully godly
Ministers, in setting them at liberty from their former Persecutors, and giving
them all Encouragement in the Exercise of their Ministry, and by adding
toward their maintenance a considerable Revenue over and above what was
anciently settled by Law; They also encouraged Learning, by reforming the
Unive^sities, and increasing the maintenance of the Governors of Colleges,
where there was need; And what a mercy is it like to prove to the Nation, there
being so many hopeful Plants, that in a short time (by the blessing of God)
may be fit for public service: And while they were thus promoting the Interest
of Christ, how did the Lord bless their Councels and Forces by Land and Sea,
to the admiration of their Friends and Enemies both at home and abroad?

But as heretofore there never wanted Instruments to vilify, oppose, persecute
or undermine the faithful Ministers, and preaching of the Gospel, so of late
years, yea, at this day, what scorn and contempt is cast upon them? and what
endeavors are used by Petitioning and otherwise to destroy the Universities,
and undermine the Preaching of the Gospel, by taking away that ancient settled
Maintenance which has been Owned and Acknowledged as their due, by all
Parliaments and Courts of Justice time out of mind: And if the Jesuits, and
those that are Popishly affected (of which we have cause to fear there are many
in this Nation) succeed in their present Councels and Practices and
disaffecting the Nation, to the Universities and Learning, and the profitable
use of it, in the Preaching of the Gospel, and confuting errors; And likewise
shall prevail in removing the present settled maintenance which is earnestly
endeavored by them; And persuade that the Civil Magistrate has nothing to do
in matters of Religion: They will then be in a very great forwardness to
attain that design they have had against this Nation, ever since the first
Reformation from Popery.

Now though the Consideration of all these things lies sad upon our hearts, we
cannot but with than^fulnesse acknowledge that there is a supreme Power over
us, to whom we have encouragement to make our humble address; Who have been
pleased so publicly and affectionately to declare, That you will be as tender
of the Lives, estates, Liberties, just rights and proprieties of all others as
ye will be of your own and of your Posterities. And further that you cannot but
acknowledge that ye are not yet at rest, nor can believe ye have yet enjoyed or
seen enough to accomplish the end of God, or satisfy the thoughts of men, for
that vast expense of blood and Treasure which could not have been endured with
any patience; But in hope, that at length those bitter pangs and throws would
make some way for that long expected birth of Peace, Freedom, and Happiness,
both to the souls and bodies of the Lords people; And while we are waiting for
the fruit of such pious resolutions, it cannot but be much grief of heart, and
regret of spirit to your Petitioners, to have this Parliament unworthily
traduced and reflected upon by some persons which we humbly conceive, do
directly tend to the gratifying of the common enemy, the raising of Sedition,
disturbing of the present Government, and destruction of this Commonwealth.

The premises considered,

Your Petitioners do humbly pray, that care be taken that the precious truths
of the Gospel, which has been the blessed portion of this Nation so many
years, may be preserved in their purity, that the faithful dispensers thereof,
being men Learned, Godly, and void of offense, may receive all due
encouragement. And that such (being so approved) may be sent forth to preach
the Gospel.

That the settled maintenance by the Laws of the Land for them, may be further
confirmed; And that the Acts and Ordinances of Parliament formerly made to this
purpose may be put in execution: and such other provision made that their just
proprieties may be preserved.

That the Universities also that are the Seminaries of all sorts of Litrature,
so eminently useful for this Commonwealth; both in respect of Civil
Government, and also the propagating and defending the blessed truths of the
Gospel, may be zealously countenanced and encouraged,

All which we humbly submit to your Grave and Pious consideration And shall
ever pray.
Friday the 2 d of September 1653.
THE Petitioners were called in, and being come to the Bar Mr Speaker by
Command of the House did return thanks to the Petitioners for their good
affections to the Parliament, and acquainted them that some of the matters in
the Petition are under consideration, and as touching that which concerns the
traducing the Parliament, the Petitioners are referred to the Council of State
to give Informations to them therein, and that the Parliament does not doubt
but they will continue their care of the Peace and safety of the City.

Hen: Scobell Clerk of the Parliament.
