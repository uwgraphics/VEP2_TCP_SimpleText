Honored Sir,
THat the works of Mercy and Charity are the fruits of Piety, is the undoubted
Tenent of all Christians, grounded upon the clear proofs of Scripture: 58 Is.
the whole chap.

And that the fruits of Piety should be always fresh and flourishing, is as
clearly evidenced in holy writ: 92 Ps. 12, 13, 14.

And then most especially, when the Lord God has been seen in the Mount, in
the time of Eminent and Imminent danger and distress; and has given signal
deliverances, by imparalleld Victories both by Sea and Land: 68 Ps. per tot.

Therefore you are most humbly, and earnestly entreated, that you would be
pleased, to call upon the Grand Act for employing, and releiving the Poor of
the whole Nation: which (after ten months conception) for some weeks has been
dormant (in the Birth) upon the ingrossement; And without your assistance may
prove abortive: Together with the Afterbirth thereof; An additionall Act for
the Corporation for the Poor of the City of London, without which the newly
laid foundation in their work, (in which (by the blessing of God) they have
made some good progress) will be in danger to be demolished.

These things are humbly proposed unto you in the Name of the Corporation
aforementioned,

By your most humble Servant EDWARD ODLING atrs Solicitor for the said
Corporation.
