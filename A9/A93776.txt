A Salutation or Testimony of true and Brotherly Love, as it did arise in our
hearts, unto all as are concerned therein.
Dear Friends,
TO whom the Truth of God has appeared, and has been made known amongst us,
in the Light of his beloved Son whom he has sent into the World to discover
Darkness and the ways of sin in the hearts and Consciences of the children of
men; that so all may depart from it, and the ways of it, as it is made known
and discovered to themselves by the Light that shines in their hearts, which is
the Standard to try all by, and the Balance to weigh all in, of what sort
soever, whether it be of God or no* And this is the Rule for all of us to walk
by, even the Law of Light, which gives Life and Salvation to all that believes
and therein abide. And this is it, which first gathered us together, and begot
desires in us after the Lords Way, with which our Souls are refreshed and our
Spirits comforted and consolated, often in the enioym^nt of it, more then with
our appointed food; when we have met together to wait upon him in his Heavenly
Way, and blessed manifestation of Divine Love, He has filled our hearts with
his Heavenly Dew, and refreshed us, as with the early and latter rain; and
here the Lords Power we came to feel revea^ed, which works all our wor^s in
and for us, by the Opperation of his own Eternal Spirit, by which He is
cleansing his Sanctuary, and making all vessels fit for the Masters use, for
Life to Reign in; that the Love of God may overflow in all, to the Inviting the
Nations, that they may all walk in the Light of the Lamb and be saved; which
is and always has been our desire, and that which we have Breathed unto the
Lord for as for our selves, that so all may come to the knowledge of the Truth
and be saved. Wherefore all Dear Friends, mind Gods leading Power in all
things whereunto you are called, and therein abide with the Lord, answering a
conscience void of offense toward God and man: That so the Truth may be
Adorned in us all, by a Holy Life and Godly Conversation, as becomes the Gospel
of our Lord Jesus Christ amongst us all; That so God over all may have the
Glory and Honor, to whom it belongs for Evermore.

And now Dear Friends, for as much as we have sometimes met together to
discourse of Trades and Callings, but more perticularly of our own, and of
which we are in being Tailors: in which we have met with many trialls on every
hand for many years together, though little of it by some of us has been
declared, knowing the Arm and Power of the Lord that supported us through all,
and has given us a reward who have stood faithful to his requirings, which is
our desire, for all that are convinced of the Lords Truth, and knows his
Heavenly Way to walk in it; and where any thing appears to draw back or hinder,
to cast it of, though it be as the right Hand or the right Eye, yet if it
offends pull it out, and cast it from thee, and Enjoy Life which is more then
all. And this is our desire for you all that are our Brethren, who have
believed in the Truth, that you keep nothing back that God calls for: and that
you have not Peace in your Employments, of which we have sometimes Discoursed,
concerning Superfluity, and things altogether needl^ss, and that which some of
us for many years have left undone, and we wish it were so with all, that
there might be a Clearness and an inlarge^ent in the Lords Power, and an
Increase of his Love, which is much better then the Increase of Corn, and
Wine, and Oil. And these things Friends, we lay before you in the Love of God,
and in a true sense of the same, as being delivered from under those Burdens,
that many yet groan under, and are not Redeemed out of, a^ Lace, Ribbons, and
needless Buttons, and such like things which the Light does not Justify; but
is out of that in which the true Fellowship stands. And as for the manner and
way of Answering the World in Making their Clothes, we leave it to the Witness
of God in you all, and as much as in you lies beget them into M^deration; and
as for Friends, we hope that they will not desire, nor wear any thing
unconvenient, and therefore need say nothing about it more: Beliveing the Lord
will so open their Understanding, as that they will Preach to the World in all
things, and Adorn themselves as becomes the Gospel; which is the Power of God,
by which we are called, and the way in which we are to walk, while we are in
these Earthly Tabernacles; that so our Lights may shine forth to the World,
that they seeing our good works, may Glorine our Father which is in Heaven,
and that to the Brightness of our Rising, many may come and say, Come let us go
up to the Mountain of the Lords House, even to the House of the God of Jacob:
For he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. And this is
that our very Souls Travel for, to God for you all, and for every one
convinced of the Lords Heavenly Truth, that all may enjoy it fully, and that
nothing may be wanting; and for this cause is this Written, in the Requirings
of the Lords Dear and tender Love to you all, not as exercising Lordship over
Gods Heritage, nor with Reflection upon any Man's Person; no^ for Disputation,
nor leading into Parties, or gratifiing any narrow private Judgment, but for
the Honor of Truth, and the Glory of God, which is our whole Aim the Lord
knows; So in the Blessed Unchangeable Truth of God, we salute you all Dear
Brethren, and in which we remain in Love unfeigned,

From our Meeting in London, the 25th of the First Month, 1672. Your Dear
Friends and Brethren, Gilbert Latye, ^ho. Taunto^ William Tillit, John
Bowlover, Edward Eldershaw, John Pearce, William Walker, William Taylby,
William Brown,
