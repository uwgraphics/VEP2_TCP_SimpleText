His Majesty's SPEECH TO THE States General, As He was Seated in the Chair, in
Their ASSEMBLY.
My Lords,
UPON my last Departure from this Country, I did intend to dispatch, with what
Expedition I could, the Affairs of my own Kingdoms; which having done
accordingly, I am come hither again, to Execute my Office as Captain General,
Admiral, and Statholder; and to Contribute all that is possible for Me to do,
for a speedy Peace; and to put an End to this War-To which End, I have sent
over all the Forces, out of my Kingdoms, that I could spare, to join those of
this State. And as to the Fleet, I have taken such Care, that the most part of
it is now ready; and hope, That of this State is in the like Posture: desiring,
that the Great God, the Maker of all things, would so Bless the Arms of this
State, and the rest of the Confederates, that they may obtain that which is
most in their Eye, A Good Peace. I will do all that I can, for the Common Good
and Welfare of this State, not sparing my own Person; and I assure you of my
Sincere Intentions, and good Affection to You; and thank your Lordships for the
Honor you have done Me, and for your Congratulations upon my Arrival.

The Answer of the States General, to the Kings SPEECH.
Most Sovereign Prince,
