8. Q. In what state are we now born since the fall?

A. 1. We are born guilty of Adam's first sin. Romans 12, 19. 2. Destitute of
God's favor. Ephesians. 2, 3. 3. Destitute of God's image. Genesis 5.3. Romans 7.18. 4.
Under the sentence of condemnation. To. 5.16. 5. Prone to all evil. Psa. 58.3.

A. 1. The fallen Angels cannot escape it, therefo^^ neither could we without a
Savior. 2 Pet. 2, 4. 2. Adam without a Savior must needs have peris^
therefore so should we. Genesis 3.8. 3. The Law or covenant of works cannot
justi^^ any transgressor, Romans 8, 3. 4. God who has threatened us, Genesis 2.17.
and u^ on our fall accordingly has condemned us, To. 5, 1^^ cannot lie:
therefore without a Savior bearing t^ Curse for us, we must needs have born it
our selv^ for ever, Gal. 3, 13. 5. We being God's creatures, finite beings, a^
sinners; can never do or suffer any thing sufficient ^^ satisfy the infinite
Justice of God offended, to turn ^^ way his infinite wrath incensed, or to
redeem our l^^ Souls from infinite Misery deserved; that for our o^^ sakes God
should discharge us, Isa. 40.16, 17. To. 5^^ 6. We cannot redeem a Brother from
tempo^^ death, Psa. 49.7, 8. much less our own lost Souls from eternal. 7. We
continually offend, and cannot but increa^^ our score, that we might hasten our
Ruin; so far a^ we from being able to purchase our own salvation. ^^ 7.20. 8.
Our very best duties are stained, and need a ^^viour for their pardon and
acceptance; so far are the from being able to make amends for our offenses,
N^^ 13, 22. 9. God did not send his Son without need in resp^^ ^^ us, to endure
scourgings and so sharp a death for ^ur Redemption, Gal. 2.21.
10. Q. How does it appear that Christ is able to save us?

A. 1. The H. G. in the Scriptures and in Believers ^earts, does ^estifie that
Christ is able to save us, Heb ^^ 25. Romans 8.33, 34. 2. He is the Savior that
should come into the world; ^r is there any other, Mat. 16, 16. Jo. 6.36, 37,
39. ^ct. 2.30. 3. He is a Savior of the Fathers own providing, ^om. 3.25. Isa.
42.1. Jo. 1.19. 4. We find the first Adam could undo us, and cannot the second
much more save us, Romans 5.15, 16, 17. 5. God did graciously lay our sins on
him, that his ^^ghteousness might be imputed unto us, 2 Cor. 5.21. 6. Christ
undertook the work of Redemption with ^light, Heb. 10.6, 7. and finished it, Jo.
17.4. fulfilling ^^ righteousness, Mat. 3.15. and offering himself a Sa^^fice
for us, 1 Cor. 5.7. that no more need be done for ^r Redemption, either by
himself or any other, Heb. ^^ 8, 10, 12, 14. 7. He is God blessed for ever,
that has done and suf^^ed all this for us, Mat. 1.23. Romans 3.21. Act. 20.28.
^^re is therefore an infinite worth in his obedience (...) sacrifice. 8. The
Father did delight in his person, Mat. 3.17. ^^ satisfied with what he did, Jo.
8.29. and with what suffered for us, Ephesians. 5.2. that he has raised him from ^^
Dead and received him to Glory, Ephesians. 1.20. 9. Christ does now expect his
purchase. He. 13.13. 10. The Angels believe God's good will toward ^^, Lu^ 2,
11, 13, 14. on the account of Christ. 11. The Father punishes on Christ's
account to renew the hearts of sinners, forgive their sins, and save their
Souls, Heb. 10.14, 16, 17. Isa. 49.6.
11. Q. What reason have we to be reconciled to the providence of God, or his
governing and ordering of all things?

A. 1. There is a necessity that some Being or other should order and govern
all things, Rev. 12.7. 2. There is no creature able or fit to do it, Job 4.18.
3. It is most righteous and meet, that he who made all, should dispose of all,
Isa. 45.9. 4. The Lord is most holy, and will wrong no man, Genesis 18.25. 5. It
is good for us, wicked men and Devils cannot carry on things as they would have
them, Ac. 4.27, 28. 6. And that he who gave Christ for us manageth all things,
Jo. 5.17. 7. He will be good to him that waits for him, to the soul that
seeks him, Lam. 3.25. 8. He is full of love to the Upright, and will order
all for their good, Psa. 11.7. 9. He is unchangeable in his kindness and good
will to his people, 1 Samuel 12, 22. 10. He is most wise and knows how to order
all for the best, 2 Pet. 29. 11. He is most mighty and able to restrain evil,
and bring good to pass, Isa. 43.13. 12. He is most faithful to his word, Psa.
25.10. 13. He sets himself against none but the ungodly and impenitent, Exodus
34.6, 7.
12. Q. Upon what terms is God willing to save us?

A. 1. If we truly Repent, that is, heartily grieve for our sins, Ps. 51, 17.
ingeniously confess, 1 Jo. 1, 9. and thoroughly turn from them to the Lord, Ez.
18.21, 22. 2. If we unfeignedly believe in Christ, Joh. 3.16. and in God
through him, 1 Pet. 1.20, 21. 3. If we sincerely obey the Lord, Exodus 19.5.
13. Q. Must not we design and labor, by keeping the Commandments, to satisfy
God's justice, and purchase forgiveness and favor with him?

A. 1. We must by Faith, trust in Christ's righteousness as that which has
already satisfied God's justice, and purchased forgiveness and favor with God,
Philip. 3, 3. 2. If we have not Faith to trust in Christ's righteousness, we
must in the use of all means seek it of God's free grace, Cant. 1.4. 3.
Obteining Faith, we must obey God's commandments, to testify our love to God
in Christ for his grace toward us, Isa. 6.8. 4. And to please God, Col. 1.10.
5. And to testify our subjection to Christ, Psa. 2.12. 6. And to glorify God,
Mat. 5.16. 7. And to make sure our own salvation, 1 Ti. 6.18, 19. 8. But we
must not by our Obedience, think to satisfy God's justice, and purchase
forgiveness and favor with God. For 1. Nothing can satisfy God's justice and
purchase forgiveness and favor with God, but a righteousness which fully
answers the threats of the Law, for we are sinners, Gal. 2.20. which fully
answers the commands of the Law, for we are humane Creatures, Mar. 12.30, 31.
which is of infinite value, that it might bear proportion to the infinite evil
that is in sin, the infinite blessedness that is to be recovered, and the
infinite misery from which there is to be deliverance Isa. 40.16 and which God
has appointed to that end, Heb. 10.5. 2. Our best Obedience comes far short of
all this. 3. Christ's righteousness comes up to all this, Gal. 3.13. Mat. 3.15.
Act. 20.28. Heb. 10.9. and the Father graciously accepts it for us, Job 33.24.
4. For us to go about our own obedience to satisfy God's justice and purchase
forgiveness and favor with him, is to have too high thoughts of our selves, Lu.
18.11. too mean thoughts of God, Job 22.2, 3. to despise Christ's righteousness,
Heb. 10.29. to reject God's grace, Gal. 2.21. to undertake an impossible task,
Ec^les. 7.20. to lose all, Romans 9.31. 5. By faith to rely on Christ's
righteousness, as that which has already satisfied God's justice for our sins,
and purchased forgiveness and favor with him; is to have a due esteem of Christ
s righteousness, Phil. 3.8, 9. a due esteem of God's grace, Gal. 2.21. to be
truly humble, Hab. 2.4. to obey the Gospel, Jo. 6 29. to take a sure way to
Justification and Life, Mat. 16.18.
14. Q. How are we Justified?

A. 1. The Father does justify, To. 8, 33. by imputing to us Christ's
righteousness, To. 5.19. and for the sake thereof pardoning and accepting of
us. 2. The Son does justify us, Act. 13.39. bringing in everlasting
Righteousness, or obeying his Father unto death to satisfy his justice, and
purchase his favor for us. 3. The H.G. does justify us, 1 Cor. 6, 11. by
working faith in us, and helping us to apply Christ. 4. Free grace does
justify us, Romans 2.24. by providing a surety for us, accepting faith for the
condition of our interest in him, and giving faith and Christ tous. 5. The
Gospel does justify us, by revealing, To. 1.16. and offering Christ to sinners,
Rev. 22.17. applying and making over Christ to believers, 1 Pe. 1.20, 21. and
being the Rule by which God will proceed in Judgment, Romans 2.16. 6. Faith does
justify us, To. 3, 28. by embracing and trusting in Christ, and so giving us an
interest in his righteousness, because God has made it the great condition of
the Gospel. 7. Works do justify us, by being an evidence of, and help unto our
Faith, Ja. 2.24.
15. Q. What are the saving acts of a lively Faith?

A. 1. To believe what the Scripture speaks concerning Christ, so as to trust
in him for Justification and Salvation. Gal. 2.16. Or to believe so as to
receive Christ for justification and salvation, Joh. 1.12. 2. No act of a dead
Faith is justifying or saving, Ja. 2.14. Not believing the truth concerning
Christ, Act. 8.13. Not beleiving so as to trust in him, Jo. 2.23. Not believing
so as to receive him, Luke 8.13. 3. Faith is then lively when it not only
believes what is revealed in the Word concerning Christ, so as to trust in him
and receive him for Justification and Salvation, but likewise so, as to prize
him, 1 Pet. 2.7. Love God for him, 1 Ti. 1.15, 17. as to be thereby humble,
Hab. 2.4. Purified, Act. 15.9. Sanctified, Act. 26.18. as to work by Love, Gal.
5.6. Overcome the World, 1 Jo. 5.4. be emboldened to appear for Christ, 2 Cor.
4.13. as to do and suffer great things for God and Christ when called to it,
Heb. 11.
16. Q. What inducements have we to believe in Christ for Salvation?

A. 1. We are utterly lost in our selves, Mat. 18.11. 2. None but Christ is
able to save us, Jo. 6.68. 3. Christ is abundantly able to save us, Heb. 7.25.
4. We are graciously called and invited to him, Ma. 11.28. 5. He is freely
offered to every one of us, Re. 22.17. 6. We are commanded to believe, 1 Jo.
3.23. 7. We have a promise that if we believe in Christ we shall not perish,
Jo. 3.16. 8. If believe not in Christ, we shall never partake of him, but
perish without remedy, Mar. 16, 16. 9. Other great sinners have found favor
with the Lord, Lu. 7.47. 1 Timothy 1.13. 10. We can never be holy, Heb. 11.6. nor
steadfast with God, if we will not believe in Christ for Salvation, Heb. 3.12.
17. Q. When do we sincerely obey the Lord?

A. 1. When we are not false hearted with the Lord, Psa. 51.6. 1 Chronicles. 12.33.
Jer. 3.10. 2. When the Rule and Motive of our Obedience is the Lord's Command,
Psa. 119.5, 4. 3. When the principle of our Obedience is love to the Lord,
Phillip. 1.16, 17. 4. When the end of our Obedience is to please the Lord, 2
Cor. 2.17. 5. When our Obedience is willing and hearty Obedience, 2 Chr. 29.^^.
Col. 2.23, 24. 6. When we are careful to frame our inward, as well as outward
man, according to God's Word, Mat. 25.25. 7. When the bent of our heart is
against every thing that is evil, and forevery thing we know the Lord requires
of us, Ps. 119.80, 128. 1 Chr. 29.19. 1 Kin. 9.4. 8. When though we have many
failings yet the general Course and Tenor of our life is squared by the will of
God, Psa. 112.2, 3. Job 17.9. Jam. 1.8. 2 Chr. 15.17. 9. When we hold on in our
obedience, Psa. 112.2, 3. Jam. 1.8. despising baits that would entice us to
destroy, Cant. 8.7. and welcoming crosses we meet with in obeying, Act. 20, 23,
24. 10. When still we have mean thoughts of our selves and fly to free grace
and Christ's merits for acceptance, knowing how short we come in many things,
Neh. 13.22. Heb. 11.4.
18. Q. Are we able by the strength of Nature to repent, believe, and sincerely
obey the Lord, or need we special renewing grace and strength from God to help
us?

A. We need special Grace and Strength; For

1. That grace of Faith that saves us, is not from our selves, it is the gift
of God, Ephesians. 2.8. and such grace we need. 2. Regeneration is needful for every
one of us, Jo. 3.3, 5. and this is a special work of God's Spirit. 3. God's
promise of special renewing grace, Eze. 36.26 and of special strength, Psa.
110.3. are no promises of needless things. 4. God does give special grace to
assist herein, for he gives more to the Elect, than he does to others, Mat.
13.11. 5. None of us make our selves to differ, 1 Cor. 4.7. therefore we
neither Repent, Believe, or sincerely Obey without special grace. 6. God's
image being lost by the Fall, To. 7.18. until we are renewed by grace, it
cannot be, we should have any might to do what is spiritually good, Romans 9.16.
Ephesians. 2.1. Jo. 6.44. Jer. 10.23. Romans 8.7. 7. We cannot without special grace,
so much as understand the good of spiritual things, 1 Cor. 2.14. much less can
we will and embrace them. 8. Our corruptions in our natural state are so strong
withstanding against us, that without special grace we cannot do what is
spiritually good, Jer. 13.23. To. 8.8. 9. We are by nature under Satan's power,
Ep. 2.2. We need therefore the mighty arm of God, to set us free, Act. 26.18.
10. Whenever we seriously endeavor to return to God, we then find that by the
strength of Nature, we cannot, Jer. 31.18. 11. Even those that have the
advantage of renewing grace, find need of further assistance from God to do
what is good, Cant. 14.2 Cor. 3.3. Gal. 5.17. Romans 7.23. 12. They that are
indeed enabled and so brought into a saving state, ascribe this to the special
work of God, Tit. 3.5.
19. Q. After what manner, and by what degrees are men ordinarily changed and
renewed by the Spirit of God?

A. 1. Usually they are made to see their sin and danger as they never saw
before, Act. 9.4. 2. Then they are filled with abiding fear of God's wrath,
Act. 9.6. 3. They hear, and mark, and pray, if by any means they may escape,
Act. 16.14.9, 11. 4. They are made to see more worth in Christ, then ever they
saw before, Gal. 1.15, 16. 5. They have some refreshing hopes, though a
possibility of escaping, Jonah. 3.9. 6. They earnestly desire and use all means
to get Christ, Rev. 21.6. 7. They are made to see God's grace and good will to
give Christ freely to them, Tit. 3.4. 8. Their hearts are melted with this
grace, Lu. 7.38. 9. They are encouraged to receive Christ freely offered to
them, 1 Timothy 1.15. 10. They are filled with love to the Lord, Jo. 21.15. 11.
They can easily yield now to put away what is displeasing, and chose what is
pleasing to the Lord, Lu. 19.8. 12. They have an abiding bent of heart for ever
to cleave to the Lord. Romans 8.35.
20. Q. What are the privileges of those whose hearts are thus savingly
renewed?

A. 1. They are united to Christ, Ephesians. 5.30. 2. Christ's obedience and
sufferings are imputed to them, Romans 5.19 3. They are justified from all their
sins, Romans 8.30. 4. God is their reconciled Father, 2 Cor. 6.17, 18. 5. They
have that peace the world cannot give, Jo. (...). 6. The H. G. is given to
carry the Son in Obedience, Pro. 1.23. Ezekiel. 36.27. 7. They shall never fall
away, Isa. 42.3. 8. All shall work together for their good, To. 8.28. 9. When
they dye, their souls shall be carried in^^ Abraham's bosom, Luke 16.22. 10.
They shall have a blessed resurrection, Jo. 5.29. 11. They shall have a public
justification, Ma. 25.23. 12. They shall have eternal Salvation, Mat. 25.46.
21. Q. What are the Miseries of those that are no^ thus savingly renewed?

A. 1. They are Christ-less. Ephesians. 2.12. 2. They are not in favor with God, Ephesians.
2.3. 3. They have no sure title to Salvation, Romans 3.23. 4. They stand
condemned by God's Law, to everlasting death for sin, To. 5.18. 5. If they
continue in that state till they dye, they be irrecoverably lost, Eccles. 9.10.
6. They are never to enjoy comfort more, Luke 16.25. 7. They have lost God for
ever, 2 These. 1.9. 8 They are to rise again to everlasting contempt, Dan. 12.2.
9 They are to be Condemned publicly at Judgment, Mat. 25.41. 10. They are to
be carried Body and Soul into a Lake of Fire and Brimstone with damned spirits,
Rev. 20.15. 11 They are to live for ever in that Lake to feel their torments,
Rev. 14.11. 12. Through blindness and false peace they are not like to prevent
their misery, unless God of his infinite mercy bestow grace on them, Je. 2.34.
Prove. 23.34.
22. Q. Since God only can savingly renew us what should a poor graceless
sinner do to obtain it of God?

A. 1. He should frequently think what a happiness it is to be saved; what a
misery to be damned, Isa. 52.15. 2 He should settle it in his heart, that an
unregenerate Christless sinner cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven, Jo. 3.5. 3.
He should beware, least willful unbelief, Genesis 19.14. false peace, Luk 17.28.
Love of ease, Luke 13.24. and pleasure, 1 Timothy 5.11. Purposes for the future,
Mat. 8.21. make him trifle away his season and prove his bane. 4. He should
speedily break off from bad Company, 2 Cor. 6.17. and gross sin, Isa. 1.16.
least he provoke God never to give him grace while he lives. 5. He should
believe God is willing to change and save some sinners, Jer. ^.14. having given
Christ to dye for them, and chosen them from Eternity, Isa. 51.11. 6. He should
hear, Luke 10 39. and pray, Joel. 2.32. and read and pray, Jo. 20.31. and
converse with God's people and pray, Jo. 4.39. if by any means he might obtain
of God a saving change. 7. He should resolutly hold on in the use of means,
though he loose all his Labor at last, Luke 5.5. 8. He should not suffer the
affairs of the World to take him off, L^k. 8.14. nor the delays of God. 1 Samuel
13.8, 9. nor renewed sins, Psa. 147 11. ^^ the temptations of the Devil, Mat.
12.43. nor ^^ scoffs of the Wicked, Jo. 12.43. nor the unkindness of the godly,
Psalm 55.13. nor the impatience of ^^ Flesh, Lam. 3.26. to discourage him in his
pur^^ of grace 9 When Gods Spirit discovers Wrath, he sho^^ willingly and
patiently yield to the Conviction to ^^ prepared thereby to welcome Grace, Romans
8.15. 10 He should let every little glimpse of men^^ cherish hope still, still,
to wait on God, Jud. 13.2^ Lam. 3.22. 11 He should not account himself savingly
chan^ed, till he is made to take his greatest content in G^^^ Psalm. 73 25. and
Christ Phil. 3.8. and holiness Ps^^ 2. Jer. 6.10. 12 He should trust in the
name of the Lord, Isa. ^^.10. and frequently cast himself on the merits ^^
Christ's Blood, Heb. 6.18. though he perish, if were possible, when he has
done.
23 Q. What Is to be done before hearing the W^^^ to profit by it?

A. 1. We are to have Faith in God's Ordinan^^ Isa. 55.10. Romans 1.16. 2. We
should acquaint our selves with our spi^^tual state, Jam. 4.6. 3 We should put
away all sin from us, 1 Pet. 1, 2. 4 We should pray for a suitable Word, and
blessing on the Minister, and on out selves, Pr^. 2.3.
24. Q. What Is to be done in Hearing?

A. We ought to be reverent as before God, Act. 10 (...) 2. We ought to apply
the Word to our selves, (...). 40.7. 3. We should watch against wanderings, Isa.
55.2. 4. We should have short ejaculations toward God ^^^bless this, and that
Word to us, Psalm. 119.10, (...).
25. Q. What Is to be done after Hearing?

A. 1. We should reflect upon our miscarriages, (...). 1.5. 2 We should recall
what we heard and did affect us, ^^^k 8.12. Heb. 2.1. 3. We should observe how
the Word suits with ^^^od's Providence in the course of our Lives, Psa. 73.
(...). 4. We should immediately put the Word in practice, Genesis 21.14. Psalm.
119.60.
26 Q. How should we read the Word of God to ^^ofit by its?

A. 1. We are to read often at least once a day, ^eut. 17.19. 2. Before Reading
we should look up to God for (...) blessing, Mar. 8.6. 3. In Reading we should
keep a depending Eye on ^^od for enlightening, Psalm. 119.12. 4 We should
consider what goes before, and what ^^lows that we may understand, Mat. 24.15.
5 We should Read believingly, as the Word of ^^od, Rev. 19.9. 6 We should fix
one or two things which (...) affect us, Psa. 119, 11. 7 We should have an high
esteem of it, Psa (...) 10. 8 We should often think of it in the business of
(...) day, Psa. 119.97. 9. We should live suitable to it, Psalm. 119.59.
27 Q. Are the Children of Believers now externally in the Covenant with God,
as the children (...) the Israelites were of old?

A. 1 Yes, 1. Believers are the engrafted memb^^ of that Body of people whose
Children were so ^^ken into Covenant, Romans 11.17. Ephesians. 2.14, 15, (...) To.
12.4. 1 Cor. 12.12. 2 Believers are children of the Promise as Isa (...) was,
Gal. 4.28. 3. The Gospel is for taking in all those that w^^ not received
before, To. 9.25. Therefore not (...) excluding the children of believers, who
were taken (...) before. 4 The Kingdom of Heaven the highest blessing (...) the
Covenant belongs to the children of believe (...) Mat. 19.14. 5. The children
of Believers are called Ho^^^ 1 Cor. 7.14. as by reason of the Covenant, the
People of Israel were so called heretofore, Deuteronomy. 14.1, (...). 6 It is expressly
said, the Promise does belong (...) Children, Act. 2.38, 39. 7 If the children
of Believers were utterly excluded from God's Covenant then not having do^^ any
actual evil themselves, the children of believing Jews were loosers by Christ's
Death, and by their Pa^^^s Faith; there would be no difference between ^^y
Believers children, and the children of Infidels, ^^ere would be no hope of the
Salvation of any of ^^em dying in Infancy, Ephesians. 2.12. 8 So extensive and free
is Gods grace, that, as of ^^d a Prosel^^s child, and servant, and servants
child ^as taken into Covenant with God, as well as himself, Exodus 12.48. so now
a believers Child and Servant ^^d Servants Child, even all within his Family
are ^^ken into Covenant with God, on the believers account, because he is a
Child of Abraham. Luke 19.9.
28 Q. What advantage is it to be externally in Ce^^nant with God?

A The same that it was to the Jews of old. (...) Though those who are not by
means of believing Parents thus in Covenant, are not to despair, ^^ct. 10.34.
Isa. 56.6. Genesis 22.18. 2 And all are not Infallibly saved who are thus in
^^^ovenant with God, Mat. 8.12. Deuteronomy. 29.4. Genesis (...). 10.25.25. Romans 11.20. 3
Yet such are more nearly related to God then ^^e rest of the World, Ezekiel. 16.8.
Mat. 8.12. (...). 1.2. Romans 9.4. Lev. 25.42. 4 If they dye in Infancy there is
more hope of their Salvation then of others so dying, Ephesians. 2.12. (...). 112.2.
Exodus 20.6. Genesis 19.24. 1 Samuel 15.3. 5. If they live and are wicked, there is
greater ^^^e of their conversion, then of other wicked men, (...) Chron.
32.33.33.12. 6 They have greater encouragement to seek God in all their wants,
Deuteronomy. 4.7. Hos. 12.6. 7. They may plead in their Parents right, when they doubt
of their own, Genesis 32.9. 8. They will have greater cause to honor their
Parents when they see blessings by means of them derived to them, Psa. 116.16.
Exodus 15.2. Pro. 17.6. 9. This is a greater encouragement to their Parents to
pray for them, Genesis 17.18. and give the^ a good Education, Genesis 18.19. 10. This
lays an obligation on others to deal kindly with them, Genesis 25.41.42. 2 Samuel
19.1. 11. This lays a great obligation on them to devo^^ themselves to the
Lord, Psalm. 116.16. to serve^th^ Lord, Acts 24.14. Levit. 25.42. and live
holily^ Deuteronomy. 7.6. and make sure of Salvation, Mat. 8.12. to love God like
children, Romans 9.4. to make Go^ their refuge in all their streights, Deuteronomy. 4.7.
and t^ Repent when they have sinned against him, Hos. 12.6. 12. And those who
are thus in covenant with God though Infants, are to be baptized. 1. Because
God vouchsafed to his Church the privilege of confirming his Covenant, by
applying the initiating Seal thereof to the Children of believers Genesis 17.10.
and never repealed it. 2. This confirmation of the Covenant by the initiating
seal did belong to the children of the Mystical seed of Abraham, though they
were not his natural seed, Exodus 12.48. 3 Children being in Covenant, there is
the same reason why they should be baptized, as there is, why their believing
penitent Parents should, Act. 2.38.39. 4. The Gospel-initiating seal being a
Badge of the Lords people, and a further Obligation of them to be his.
Believing Parents by their own Covenant with God are bound to apply it to their
Children, Genesis 17.^0. as by the fourth Commandment they are bound ^o cause
them, when grown up, to sanctify the Christian-Sabbath; and as by the second
they are bound to ^ee them attend on other parts of the Gospel-Instituted
Worship. 3 When the Jews shall be Converted, the initiating ^^al in force, is
to be applied to their children, as heretofore, Romans 11.24. Ezekiel. 47.13,
14.36.10, (...). 6 Baptism being a means of partaking the special ^^essings of
the Covenant, Regeneration, Tit. 3.5. ^^doption, Gal. 3.26.27. Sanctification,
Col. 2.11, (...). Ephesians. 5.26. the washing away of Sin by Christ's ^ood, Act.
22.16. and Salvation, Mar. 16.16. the children of believers needing all this,
and being as papable of baptism as heretofore of Circumcision, ^^e not to be
debarred from the Ordinance. 7 It is a dangerous thing to keep from the
Initiating se^l of the Covenant, Genesis 17.14. Exodus 4.24. (...).

giving, signifies Christ's giving himself to the receivers if they accept of
him, and live to him. 4. The Peoples taking signifies their taking Christ to be
their Savior, and binding themselves to live to him. 5 Their Eating and
Drinking signifies their full and sweet enjoyment of Christ, by Faith, as the

33. Q. What is to be done after receiving?

A. 1. We should reflect upon our failings and cast our selves on the Lords
grace, and Christ's metits for pardon, 2 Samuel 23.15. 2 We should not rest in the
work done, but keep a depending eye on the Lords Grace for a blessing. Genesis
49.18. 3 Under doubts, Judge. 7.10.13, 14, 15. Temptations, 2 Cor. 5.15. Falls,
Psa. 89.34. and variety of Providence we should reflect on the Sacrament and
improve it for our Spiritual strength and comfort. 4. We should study which way
best to express our Love to Christ, Psalm. 116.11.
34. Which way should we best express our, Love to Christ.

A. 1. By remembering Christ, 2. Tim. 2.8. 2. By laboring for assurance of
Faith, that Christ is ours, Phil. 3.10. 3. By keeping up an high esteem of
Christ, Cant. 5.16. 4. By maintaining communion with Christ, Jo. 15.4. 5. By
living by Faith on Christ for acceptance, and strength, Isa. 45.24. 6. By not
grudging Christ the performance of duty against sloathful self, Deuteronomy. 10.12. 7

steadfast in Covenant, Psalm. 16.12, 14.

A. In the strength of the H. G. we may enlarge after this manner.

1 For our sin. 1. We may confess our Fall, and the corruption of our Nature,
in the whole man. 2. Then the good we have left undone. 3 Then the evil
Thoughts, Words, and Deeds we have done against the Law, and Gospel. 4 Then we
may bewail the greatness of our sins, as committed knowingly, willingly,
frequently, against all the Attributes of God, Death of Christ, and Motions of
the Holy Spirit. 5. Then we may acknowledge the dueness of Corporal, Spiritual,
and Eternal punishment, Judging our selves. 6 Then we may bless God that
Sentence is not Executed, and that mercy is to be had in Christ.
2. For our wants. 1 We may entreat that God would not punish, but pardon us

Promises. 2 Then that God would Sanctify us, subduingsin, bestowing Grace,
Repentance, Faith, and Love. 3. Then that God would manifest Reconciliation to
us. 4. Then that he would follow us with his quickening Spirit, to overcome our
spiritual Enemies, do his will in all things, and grow in grace. 5. Then that

Being, Limbs, Health, Peace, Protection, Provision. 2 Then for spiritual
blessings; that there is an Election, that Christ is given for us, that we have
the Gospel, that he has given us Faith and Holiness, if we be sure of it. 3
Then for any extraordinary, or new Mercy. 4 Then we may acknowledge the
greatness of our blessings, from Gods greatness, our unworthiness, and need. 5.
Then we may engage our selves to live his praise, commending our selves to his
Grace for aid.

37 Q. What further Rules may be given to help us in the use of this method.

Method. 2. What passages of the Word, or providence do affect us, we may, in
our thoughts, add them to that part of this Method which is proper for them to
keep furnished for Prayer. 3. Before Prayer it is needful to get our hearts
affected with God's Majesty, and Grace; one Sin, one Want, one Blessing at
least. 4. We should not be over-careful for expressions. 5 We should not covet
to go on faster than the assistance of God's Spirit depended on does carry us.
6. We need not tie our selves to every part of this, or any other Method; but
contract or add, as we find our hearts may be inclined 7. We must not covet to
be overlong. 8. Practiseing first in private, we shall the better carry it on
with others.

The Ten Commandments. Exodus 20.
GOD spoke all these words, saying I am the Lord thy God which have brought
thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the House of Bondage.

1. Thou shall have no other Gods before me. 2. Thou shall not make unto thy
self any graven Image, or any likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or
that is in the Earth beneath, or that is in the Water under the Earth; Thou
shall not bow down thy self to them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am
a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children unto the
Third and Fourth Generation of them that hate me, and showing mercy unto
thousands of them that love me and keep my Commandments. 3 Thou shall not take
the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless
that takes his name in vain. 4. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy; six
days shall thou labor and no all thy Work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath
of the Lord thy God; in it thou shall do no manner of Work, thou, not thy Son,
nor thy Daughter thy Manservant, nor thy Maidservant, nor thy Cattle, nor thy
stranger that is with in thy Gates; for in six days the Lord made Heaven and
Earth the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day, wherefore
the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. 5. Honor thy Father and thy
Mother that thy days may be long upon the Land which the Lord thy God gives
thee. 6. Thou shall not kill. 7. Thou shall not commit Adultery. 8. Thou shall
not steal. 9. Thou shall not bear false Witness against thy Neighbor. 10. Thou
shall not Covet thy Neighbors House, thou shall (...) covet thy Neighbors
Wife, nor his Man servant, nor his Maid ^^vant, nor his Ox, nor his Ass, nor
any thing that is thy Neighbors.
The Lord's Prayer.
OUr Father which art in Heaven hollowed be thy Name, thy Kingdom come, thy
will be done in Earth, etc.
