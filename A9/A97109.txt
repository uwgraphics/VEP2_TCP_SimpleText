THE VANITY Of the present CHURCHES, AND Uncertainty of their Preaching,
discovered.

WHEREIN The pretended immediate teaching of the Spirit, is denied, and the
allsufficiency of the Scriptures teaching, is maintained.

WITH, A new and true Method of reading thereof, for the peace of the mind, and
rule of life.

Gal. 6. 15. 16 For in Christ Jesus neither Circumcision avails any thing,
nor uncircumcision, but a new Creature. And as many as walk according to this
rule, peace be on them, etc. London, Printed by J. Clows, and are to be sold in

To the Reader.
ALthough I dissent from some things in this Treatise, and other things seem
dark and doubtful to me, yet there are many plain, clear, and evident Truths,
of great use to all Christians. Therefore that the Truth may be manifest to
all, And that all Believers and Churches of the Saints may be of one mind, and
may edify the whole body in love. And in all their Doctrines, and
Conversations, hold forth the truth as it is contained in the written word, the
perfect rule of the spirit to guide us into all Truth, and to make us wise unto
Salvation, through that (one necessary thing) Faith, which is in Christ Jesus:
which is by the Gospel, (the power of God to salvation) preached unto us. And
that error may be discovered, reproved, and corrected, and if possible, that
the guilty may be convinced, and reformed.

Therefore: I say to this Epistle, and the ensuing Treatise.

February 23. 1648-49. Imprimatur THEODORE JENNINGS.

The vanity of the present Churches, and uncertainty of their Preaching
discovered, etc.
AS there is nothing more commendable amongst men, then a true correspondency
between the heart, the tongue, and the hand: so no thing is more lovely amongst
Christians, then that the Conscience, the profession and the practice do
universally agree; and though something be allowable unto frailty, yet when the
defect or discord is continued, and that to the reproach of Christianity in
general, and to the prejudice of humane society; then certainly a reproof is
not only requisite, but the neglect thereof, a sin of an high nature.

And so those, whom this discourse now deemeth worthy of reproof did seem to
judge, when they condemned the persecuting practices, of the new raised
Presbyters, whose positions and professions whilst they were persecuted by the
Bishops, did clearly hold forth a full and complete liberty of Conscience, in
the exercise of Religion, and justly and truly did the Independants reprove
them, as their many books, of that Subject, do sufficiently testify: their
reproves were sharp, and their replies driven home; whereby they put the
question of the utmost liberty of Conscience, out of all question, accompting
nothing more base, or mis-beseeming a Christian, then to question, or vex, or
reproach any man for his judgment or practice, touching matters of Religion,
and inciting all men to peace, unity, love, and true friendship, though of
never so many several opinions, or different ways in Religion.

By which their ingenuity, they, (as the Puritan Presbyter had done before
them) gained abundance of love and respect from all men: their Congregations
multiplied, and in conclusion, obtained much countenance from authority: which
they no sooner tasted; but instantly, some of them began to pride themselves,
and to despise others; and to reproach and villisie all such, as upon trial
and examination of their Churches, their Pastors* and Sermons, finding all to
be but fained imitations, nothing real or substantial, forsook their
societies, and thereupon as the Presbyters had used them; so deal the
Independent with these, and all that any ways adhered unto these, raising
nicknames and bitter invective reproaches against them, sparing neither art
nor pains, to make them odious to others, and their lives (if it were
possible) a burden to themselves; and though reasons have been offered, and
conferences desired, that they might see their error, and forbear to deal
thus contrary to their positive, owned, and declared principles: yet have they
persisted therein, and go on still without ^easing, manifesting a most
destructive and persecuting disposition, not only toward these, but toward
many others whom they now (as complete Judges of other men's Consciences) judge
to be erroneous, or heriticall, and seem to have placed their felicity in the
ruin of those whom their own Consciences cannot deny to have been
isntrumental in their preservations, and who have, not thought their lives too
precious, to purchase them that freedom which now they enjoy.

And therefore it has been conceived not only just, but of absolute necessity,
to publish to the judgments of all impartial people, both of the
Congregationall way and others: this their hard measure and unthankful usage of
a harmless well-meaning people, and withal, to discover to all those who are
conscientious, the error of their ways, and emptiness of the things wherein
they glory, and to let all those who are wilful or mere politicians amongst
them, bear their shame openly, and since they are proof against their
Consciences, and can take up, and lay down principles, professions, and
practices too, as stands most with their advantage, and like the Jews in their
worst estate, make no reckoning of oppressing all that are not of their tribes,
it is but equal, that such should bear their mark in their forehead, that all
men might be warned from conversing with such deceivers, and if any tartness
appear herein, they are the occasion, it being no more then they deserve.

And not only so, but we have herein also endeavored to support the weak, and
by establishing them upon the sure foundation of the written word of God,
(inclining them to give ear thereunto, as unto the only true infallible
teacher of spiritual things in our times) and by directing them in a brief and
plain method, in the reading thereof how to attain to that one necessary
Doctrine and main design intended therein unto man, for his temporal and
eternal comfort.

To which end, that we may neither seem to wrong the one sort, nor to delude
the other, and for full satisfaction of all that are, or shall be concerned
herein: we affirm it to be most palpably evident, That ye of the Independent
Congregationall, or of any Churchway whatsoever, have not that true essential
mark of a true Church to be found amongst you, which only can distinguish the
true from the false, and without which a true Church cannot be: -- A true
Church in the Scripture sense; being such only, as wherein the very word of God
is purely and infallibly preached: that is the mark.

Now though it have been usual among you in your prayers, to desire of God
that your auditors may give ear to the word that you preach, not as unto the
word of a mortal man, but as unto the word of the ever living God: and this
too, with such solemn countenances, lifted up eyes and earnestness of
expression, as if it were the sin of sins, for men to doubt it: Though this
has been your course: do ye not tremble when you consider it, to think that
you should so frequently practice so gross an imposture, as openly to pray
unto God, that your eronious, doubtful uncertain conceptions, (for what other
are your Sermons) shall be heard and received, as the word of the ever living
God; what greater impiety, nay blasphemy, then to call man's word, Gods word, to
counterfeit a Preacher an Evangelist, an Ambassador of Christ's, and to deliver
a Word, a Message, a Gospel, mixed and made up of opinions and conjectures, as
if it were the true real word of the ever living God.

What is this but even to debase, belie, and offer despite to the spirit of God
himself, for advancing your own false Honor and repute amongst men.

Consider this serioussy, all ye that are captivated with the charmings of
these Sophisters, that are entangled in their forms of godliness, that are
drawn into their imaginary Churches, that are deluded into an opinion, that
they are pastors, feeders, preachers of the word of God, and be so true to God;
(whose honor lies at stake) to your selves whose peace and comfort lies at
stake, and to your Neighbors, whose good name lie at stake also: as to make a
clear examination whether these pretended pastors, and Churches are taught
immediately by the spirit of God, or not, as they pretend; try them by the word
they preach.

And you shall find, however they have prepossest you to the contrary, that
neither they, nor your selves, have any understanding at all of such divine or
heavenly things, as bring peace of Conscience and joy in the Holy Ghost, by any
other way or means, but only and solely by the Scriptures, and that neither
they, nor your selves, are taught by the spirit, as they have long persuaded
you, and whereby chiefly they delude you, into a belief that they are true
pastors, and your Churches, true Churches of Christ. For Judge you, had they
the spirit of God as they pretend? would they need, as they do; when they have
resolved to speak to you from a Text of Scripture, to go sit in their Studies,
three or four days together, turning over those authors, that have written
thereupon; and beating their own brains, to find out the meaning and true
intent thereof; no certainly, had they the spirit of God, it could in an
instant, in the twinkling of an eye, inform them the meaning of his own
writings; they would not need to be studying, seven, ten, or twenty years, to
understand the truth of the Gospel, and when they have done so too, be as far
to seek as they were at first for any express certainty therein; for do but
observe, that when they have for some years preached up a Doctrine, they are
many times forced to preach it down again, as ye well know most of them have
done, and that in very material points.

As for instance, are they not one while zealous for the baptizing of Infants,
another while for the baptizing of Believers only, and then again for no
Baptism at all, for want of a true Ministry? do not the Pastors differ amongst
themselves, and contentions arise not only between Church and Church, but in
every Church within it self? are there not some that for many years have
preached up election and reprobation, and afterward have as much preached it
down, and cried up general redemption, and, that man has free will or a
negative voice in his salvation, and this in a Church gathered and taught by
the spirit, as they would make the world believe; and those who by praying and
preaching ex tempore, would be thought to have yet a more immediate teaching of
the spirit; how extremely are they to seek in the ready understanding of the
Scriptures, what weak and indisgested matter issues from them, is too easily
discerned, yea what contradictions, they huddle one in the neck of another,
though through confidence in the speaker, and superstition in the hearer, all
passes for current truth.

But consider, can it be of the true spirit to produce uncertain Doctrines, if
the Trumpet give an uncertain sound, who can prepare himself to the battle; so
if the preacher, preach uncertainly, how can he affirm his word to be the word
of God; or how from such doubtfulnesse can true faith be begotten in the hearts
of the hearers? is not a Church founded upon such uncertainty, founded upon the
sand, and built up with hay and stubble, not able to stand the least blast of a
reasonable opposition; and will ye that have Consciences toward God, any
longer be instrumented in this mocking of him, and by your countenance thereof
partake with them in this strong delusion?

What does the Pope and his Clergy more then belie themselves, and blaspheam
God, in saying, they have the true spirit of God, which leads them into all
truth; whilst by their lying miracles, by their art and sophistry, they lead
the poor deluded people in the greatest errors, for maintenance of their own
pride, covetousness, and luxury: The Bishops they come, and by pretense of the
true spirit, discover abundance of faults in the Pope and his Clergy, and make
show of great reformation; but advance only themselves and their uncertain
Doctrines, for their own ambitious ends only, without any regard to the glory
of God, or good of men: then comes the Presbyters, and they cry out against
Common Prayer (that was faulty enough) and studied Sermons, as stinters, and
suppressors of the true Spirit of God in them; and they are no sooner in the
Chair, and their Prayers and preachings examined; but they also are found to
differ one with another, to contradict themselves, and to mind only their own
honor and profit; and to be possessed (as both the former) with a persecuting
Spirit, which is abhorred of God, of Christ, and of all his true Ministers and
Apostles.

Then comes the Independents and pretend to erect, a holy, pure and undefiled
worship, according to the pattern, showed unto them by the true Spirit indeed,
pleading for general liberty of conscience, void of all compulsion or
restriction, and professing the meeknes of the very Lambs of Christ, and
humility toward all men; who now could have suspected what since has been
discovered? Namely, that they as the rest, belyed the Spirit of God, (pardon
the harshnes of the expression, its for Gods cause and must be spoken) they
being no more infallibly certain of the truth, they raise from Scriptures* then
any of those whom they so much condemn* they as the rest, pray, preach, and do
all for money, and without it they do nothing, taking money for that which is not
bread, but (...), and sand mixed together; that di^ (...) people swallow it
whole, without (...)mination, it would be as gravel between their teeth, and
they would (...) it out of their mouths.

And since, they are increased in number^, and have as it were, scumm'd the
Parish Congregations of most of their wealthy and zealous members. Do they not
fully discover a serpentine disposition hankering after persecution? Do they
not daily (...) their venom privately and publicly, against any that either
separate from them, or join not with the^ and that in as foul aspertions, as
ever the (...) uttered against Luther, the Bishops against (...) Puritan, or
the Presbyter against the Independents, are they not high and skillfull in
railing? making whom they please Atheists, Anti-scripturists, Autinomians,
Anti-magistrats, Polligamists, Seekers, or what they will: and can these
proceed from the true Spirit of God, or from the Spirit of Antichrist? Judge
impartially. Ye that are yet untainted in your consciences (going on in this
Churchway as deceived, and not deceivers) whether ye can offer more dispite to
the Spirit of Grace, then by your presence and society, to justify this
delusion; or to uphold this new Idol, this Apple of Sodom, seeming only
fair to the eye, but touch it, and it falls to powder, to the very earth,
being naught but earth, like Dagon before the Arc, having neither hands nor
feet, but to (discerning eyes) is a mere useless lump, an Idol, which as the
Apostle says, is nothing in the world, and therefore let none, who mind the
things that are of God, uphold it any longer.

It being hardly to be believed, the infinite evils which comes to the world by
this false supposition and assumption of these Churches of having the Spirit of
God, or being taught immediately thereby; for by occasion thereof, no sooner
does any one embrace any opinion pretending to Religion, and begins to be
fortified therein, and that after frequent hearing, prayer, fasting, or
humiliation, he continues to be of the same mind, but presently he thinks
himself bound to declare to all the world, what the Spirit of God (as he
calls his own imagination) has made known unto him.

And hence it is, that at present, the World abounds with such variety of
opinions, concerning life and salvation, that many a sincere heatt, seeking for
peace and rest therein, is kept in perpetual suspense and doubtfullnesse,
whereby their lives become a very burden to them; and many sad, and woeful
effects, follow thereupon.

Some by their confidence, and extremity of zeal, and diligence, get their
opinions (how contrary to Scripture soever they are) into half the people of a
Town, Village and Parish; and then there is nothing but wrangling, envy,
malice, and backbiting one another, to the extreme prejudice and unquietness
of the place.

Some of them crying up their own experiences, and the teachings of God within
them, affirming that they speak not from Books, or Scriptures, written in Ink
and Paper, and in Letters and Sillables, but from the inward suggestion of the
Spirit, induce multitudes to neglect the Scriptures, and to give credit only
to their wild Notions and Opinions, and though they have no foundation in the
plain expression of the Scripture, or be contrary thereunto, yet are they
satisfied, that they only are in the truth, and all other Christians in
error, not examining their opinions by the Text, but urging that the Text is
to be interpreted by their Opinions and experiences.

And hence it is, that in the esteem of some, the Scriptures are of as small
value as the Service Book: and to speak of a Christ crucified at Jerusalem, is
carnal. Hence it is, that some, and those not a few, maintain there is no
sin, no evil, no difference of things, that all things are good, are one; and
that all things are God, and that to see or judge any otherwise, is for want of
the teaching of the Spirit; and this, though it quite contradict the whole
tenor, and plain open scope of the Scriptures, from the beginning of Genesis,
to the end of the Revelation; yet passes it for current, and gets ground in
all places.

Hence it is, that some men will neither stir, nor undertake any thing of any
nature, Civil or Natural, but as they are prompted thereunto, (as they
imagine) by the Spirit, or as some phrase it, by the drawings forth of the
Father, taken all their inclinations, likings, or dislikings, to be immediately
from God, whereby gross neglects and failings (to say no more) come to be
excused; and not only so, but expressly put upon Gods score.

Hence it is, that some after extreme fasting, and continuance in prayer,
(beyond what their bodies could bear,) extent of mind, and intention of
apprehension, have really believed, they have seen Christ standing by them, and
heard him vocally speak unto them, that they have seen a light waving about
their beds all the night long; at other times a black darkness intermixed: and
in these ecstasies, as they call them, (but indeed fevourish distempers) they
have been bid, as they thought, to do such things as the holy Scriptures
abhor; and yet could never rest till they had done them.

And hence it is, that some presume to be so Goded with God, and Christed with
Christ, as they affirm, they are in heaven, and upon the earth; that they are
ever well, and that pain is not pain; that all things are nothing, and nothing
all things, and glory that they are contradictions; Prophecy of things to
come, as the day of Judgment; name the time, the very day, see it false, and
yet profess it true (in a sense,) and are believed; write books of the Germans
mad man's Divinity, of the occurrences and success of the present
distractions, in such unheatd off expressions, concerning King, Parliament, and
all Parties, that to a man that gives good heed to the Scriptures, nothing
appears more irreligious; yet through the general supposition of the
immediate teaching of the Spirit, the authors please not only themseves, but
others; and none speaks against it, or writes, or preaches against it to any
purpose, least they should break the golden chain of their own honor or
profit; for whoever assumes, or maintains himself to be taught by, or to have
the Spirits mediate teaching, is liable to hold any thing his Fancy presents to
his Imagination, and dares not condemn the false assumption of Gods holy
Spirit, in another, least he should thereby condemn himself; since they both
have but their own bare affirmations, for their foundation, neither being able
to manifest, by any thing extraordinary, the real possession thereof.

To this sad condition are men in these times, brought by this false presence of
a Spirit, which once taken up, and insisted on, their credit becomes so
engaged, and they are so exceedingly delighted, and lifted up, in being
thought, the darlings of God, that it is the hardest thing in the world, to
make them see their mistake; offer but once to bring them into a doubt, or but
desire them to examine how (amidst so many contradictory Opinionists, all
affirming the Spirit of God for their leader in each) any one of them comes to
know himself to be in the right, and they turn the head of one side, single,
and condemn you as not enlightened, and pray not to trouble them; yet if you
enquire, what at any time the Spirit immediately has made known unto them, they
cannot tell one syllable, but recite some place of Scripture, which by serious
intention has imprinted it self in their minds.

If you demand a real Demonstration of the Spirit, they can give you none, but
(peradventure) will tell you, that you must awaite Gods time, and he will
enlighten you. That their Spirit is as the white Stone in the Revelation, the
name whereof no body knew, but he that received it; making use of false, dark,
and misterious Scriptures (intended for another end) to prove that they are
unable by any sound argument, or sensible demonstration to manifest: Whereas,
were they really endowed therewith, they could not conceal it, nor we be
unconvinced of its devine and supernatural Power, but must needs bend our
knees, and hearts in acknowledgement thereof.

If we urge the Scriptures against them, they tell us the Letter kills,
abusing, and that so grossly that place of Scripture, to the upholding their own
vain imagination; nothing being more evident, then that by Letter, in that
place of the Romans, is to be understood the Law: and by Spirit: the Gospel.

And if men did not too much Idolize their own fancies, it would soon appear,
That now in our times we have no Preacher of the Gospel but the Scriptures;
which being the infallible Word of God, the Word of Truth, Ephesians. 1. 13. not the
word of man, but (as it is in truth) the Word of God. 1 These. 2. ver. 13. which
was not yea, and nay, but yea, 2 Cor. 1. ver. 18, 19. 20. The Word of God that
abides for ever. Is it not strange, that our pretended Preachers of all sorts,
should so far prevail upon the minds of men, as to draw them from giving ear,
to what this Word of truth plainly and evidently holds forth, for the peace
of their minds, and direction of their lives; and take up their time and
thoughts wholly, or principally, with their uncertain and fallible Sermons,
making them in effect, forsake these living fountains, and digg to themselves
broken Cisterns, that can hold no water.

Nay, a wonderful thing it is, that it should be received for a current truth,
That this, the greatest blessing the World knows, this word of the ever living
God, should now come to be esteemed, but as a dead Letter; this sword of the
Spirit, that forces it self into our dead natural understandings, plants it
self there, makes us one with it: and forms us new; this regenerating word,
this immortal seed, should be so undervalued, as to pass but as a dead Letter.

Time was, that it was otherwise in England, when our Forefathers would have
given any thing in the world; yea, many of them gave up their lives, rather
then they would part with the smalest part of this precious Word, translated
into English, by the first sincere professors of true Christian doctrins; but
then Godliness was esteemed the greatest gain, and the iniquity of Learning,
was not arived to so much impudence, as to make a gain of Godliness, to make a
trade of Religion, and to become rich by pretended preaching. Nor weaned they
the people from the Scriptures, to give ear to their notions, and opinions;
telling them they had the Spirit, and that the Scriptures were but a dead
letter; but invited and persuaded all men, to a diligent consideration of the
true scope and intent of them.

Neither did they prefer the understanding of men, with difficult points, or
obscure doctrins; but (as Luther) insisted altogether upon the Doctrine of free
Justification by Christ alone; and (in way of thankfulness for so great a
benefit) invited all men, to live righteously, Godly, and soberly in this
present world; therein following the example of the Apostles, and the very end,
scope, and main design of the Scriptures; which is that unum necessarium, and
which, if people did rightly and seriously mind, they would not so easily be
drawn to follow such Teachers, or to give ear to such Sermons; whereby they
are always learning, but never come to the knowledge of this one necessary
truth.

For, how long work soever, Ministers and pretended Preachers, make of it, to
maintain themselves, and families in wealth, plenty, and honor, necessary
Doctrins are not at all hard to be understood, nor require long time to learn
them; and if it did not concern their livelihood, and profession, to make men
believe, they were people would soon understand sufficiently for their
establishment, and comfort, and would fall to practice, that so they might
become an honor to their profession of Christianity; for the Scriptures, or
word of God, having once planted this truth in the understanding, viz. That it
is the blood of Christ, which cleanses us from all sin; this Evangelicall
truth of its own nature, would instantly set man on work to do the will of him,
that has so loved him, and constrain him to walk in love as Christ has loved:
so that after this, all the care would be, how to advance the Gospel, by making
our light to shine forth before men, that others seeing our good works, may
glorify our Father which is in Heaven.

But this is no profitable way, for any of our pretended Preachers, this
Doctrine is to soon learned; for if men once come, to know that this short
lesson is sufficient; what will they regard? either printed discourses, or
Sermons, and if once they find them also full of uncertainty contradiction, and
unnecessary things, they will not part with their money for such trash, when they
may go to the two breasts of Christ himself, freely at all times, to the
Scriptures, and buy this sweet milk and honey, without money and without price;
and if men and women come once to understand this, they will not comber
themselves with many things but possessing this unvalluable truth, will ever
worship God in Spirit and in Truth; and declare unto others this blessed one
necessary comfortable way, and that not by preaching or long set speeches:
which are apt to deceive; but by conferences, and mutual debates, one with
another, (the best way for attaining a right understanding) far excelling that
which is called preaching. But then, how shall Demetrius and the Crafts-men
live? even by some lawful calling, this being the most palpably delusive of
any in the world, and it is very strange, that all men do not discern and
avoid it.

It is so, as cunningly as it is carried, and as high in repute as it is, and
has long time been, having no foundation but in the weak credulity of men;
for if men but once consider it, their Sermons will appear to be but as common
discourses, full of mistakes, errors, and at the least altogether uncertain:
and that all their preachings and prayings are only for money, and that their
greatest skill and labor, is to hold men ever in suspense; and upon pretense
of truth, to give them a bastard Scholastic knowledge, which only serve to
make men proud, wrangling Sophisters, and Disputers, vain boasters, talkers,
busybodies, censurers, Pharisees, wise in their own eyes, and despising
others, void of all true piety or real Christian virtue: and no marvel.

For such as the tree is, such ever will be the fruit; they boast to have the
Spirit of God, and you see it is but boasting, or their own imagination only:
and in the mean time* take the Scriptures for a dead Letter; and either reject
them, or make them speak according to the spirit of their own Imaginations; and
so instead of being real, are at best but fantastic Christians, uncertain (if
not false) Teachers: and such are their fruits. The greatest part of their
time, wherein they should be employed to feed the hungry, cloth the naked, or
in visiting the fatherless and widow, or in delivering the Captive, and
setting the oppressed free, (all which are works, so fully and plainly set
forth in Scripture, as most pleasing to God) being spent in talking upon some
hard texts of Scripture, such are their Sermons, or in disputes and contests,
upon some nice and difficult questions. And this exercising themselves there*
in, week after week, and day after day, and in fastings and repetitions, and in
writing of these doubtful Sermons, is by them called a Religious exercise, and
those who can but attain to so much boldness and utterance, as to speak and
pray an hour, two or three, together, take upon them, and are reputed, guifted
Christians, and principal religious persons, when as many of them get good
estates by so doing, good benefices, and others who make not a trade of it, as
many devout pastors do; yet gain so much credit thereby, as does much increase
their Trades, and advance their Custom and dealing in the world, and now and
then helps to a good round Office. And whilst any of this strain of Christians,
may live in this kind of devotion twenty years, preached for twenty or forty
shillings a year, and have the repute, of a most religious knowing Christian,
from the testimony of the most grave, learned, and solemn pastors of all
Congregations, if but a part of their religious disbursments be spent upon
them, it is not to be wondered at, that so few are found to serve God sincerely
in the way of pure and undefiled Religion, which would plume their Peacocks
feathers, and cost them more in one year, then all their lip-service, and
Churchdevotion, does many of them in their whole lifetime.

Nay, so impudent are many of these proud boasting Churches, (who glory to
follow precisely the pattern showed in the mount) that contrary to all example
of the Apostles and first Christians; they can content themselves to be known
usurers, and those that are not such themselves, can allow it in their fellow
Members, their Pastors, Elders, and Deacons can tolerate it, and why not, as
well as for their pastors to take moneys from such, as are of less ability
then themselves; nay, do not many of them spend the greatest part of their
time, either in making, buying, and selling of baubles and toys, such as serve
only to furnish out the pride, suxury, and fantasticallnesse of the world; yea,
view them well in their apparel, from head to foot; consider them in their
diet and usual feastings; in their furniture for their houses, even in these
sad and miserable times; and then say, whether their silks, their fine and
delicate linen, their Laces, Beavers, Plushes; their Fancies, Plate, Rings,
and Jewels; do not demonstrat* from what root they are, that they are mere
worldlings indeed, and Christians only in name and tongue, and not that
neither, if they are well observed.

For there are many amongst them, for slandering and backbiting; for
circumvention, and an hipocriticall carriage, shall vie and compare with any
sort of men in the world, they can play the part of Spies, Intelligencers, plot
and betray, upon pretense of intimacy, of endeared friendship and familiarity,
eat, drink, be merry with you, day after day, week after week, for months, yea
for many years, and after al: profess boldly, openly, confidently, before
their Church, to Neighbors, friends, or strangers, that all this intimacy,
friendship, familiarity, was only and merely to deceive, and to discover what
might be, to mischief, the parties with whom they held it: shall we ask which
of the Apostles was a slanderer, a spy, an Intelligencer, a betrayer; certainly
none but Judas, and the followers of Judas; let them henceforth profess
themselves, at least, let all that know them, so account them, unles they
manifest their speedy true repentance, for bringing such reproach ^o the
profession of Christianity.

But what will such men stick at, as have once dared to dissemble before God,
to call themselves Preachers, and are not: to gather Churches, and to join and
continue in the fellowship of mere mock-Churches, that dare attempt the
Ordinances with profane hands, without, and before Commission given from
above, that dare pretend Commission, and yet can show no seal, no letters of
credit from Heaven, that dare affirm their own opinions and Sermons, to be the
word of God: and all this after admonition, from such persons too, as out of
Conscience have separated from them, against whom also they persist to shoot
their most sharp and poisoned Arrows; even bitter words, false invectives,
lies, and slanders.

O therefore consider this! all ye whose Consciences, are yet sound amongst
them, or but a little taynted, and see into what a wretched condition ye may be
led before ye are aware; there is no stop in wickedness, but a progress from
one degree of evil to another, unless at first: therefore stop in time, and
come out from amongst them, least ye soon partake with them in their sins;
and neither approve, nor connive at what you see and know to be against the
judgment of your Consciences, least in time you become as the worst and vilest
of them.

Study the Scriptures, that word of truth: bless God for them, forsake them
not for the vain traditions of men, for the uncertain notions, Doctrines, and
comments of pretended Preachers; and be certain of this, that you may as soon
as they themselves, come to a good and right understanding therein, -- and that
you may do so. Read them with these Considerations.

That although whatsoever is written, is written for our learning, and that we
have great cause, to be thankful to God, for vouchsaffing us, the knowledge of
the several ways, of his dispensations to man, according to the several
times, and ages, which were from Adam, (which was the first) unto the time of
the descending of the holy spirit, (which was the last:) yet are we seriously
to know, that this last dispensation of the holy spirit, is that which
principally concerns us rightly to understand, and to apply to our selves,
both for our comfort and rule of life; for unto this time and depensation does
our blessed Savior himself refer us, saying, I will send you another
Comforter, he shall lead you into all truth, he shall bring to remembrance the
things that I have told you: and he performed his promise effectually to the
Apostles, whose writings we have, containing what the same spirit taught unto
them; the truth whereof, they were enabled, and did, confirm with miracles, so
as it might be as truly said of them, as it was of Christ our Lord; that they
taught as men having authority, and not as the Scribes, nor as the uncertain
pharisaicall teachers of these times.

Unto which word of theirs, we are principally to give heed: but therein also,
we are chiefly to discover and to mind, what that Doctrine was, which they by
the spirit, were ordained to preach? because that being understood and
believed, does give the believer thereof, the name and being of a Christian,
how plain and brief soever it be; for we must note, that there are many things
written by the Apostles upon occasions, that concerned only or chiefly, the
times wherein they wrote, and the places and persons to whom they wrote, which
is the true cause that many things are too hard for us to understand; but there
was one universal Doctrine, which they were to preach to all Nations, where
with all their writings do abound, and which is very plain and easy to be
understood.

And this is it, namely, that the same Jesus whom the Jews crucified, was Lord
and Christ: That he is the propitiation for our sins, and not only for ours,
but for the sins of the whole world, That it is the blood of Christ which
cleanses us from all sin, That his love is so exceeding toward us, that
even when we were enemies, Christ dyed for us: This was the Doctrine which
begot people unto the faith, and made them Believers: and they used no other
inducement, unto Believers, to walk as becomes this Gospel (or glad tidings of
peace and reconciliation between God and us,) but this, ye are bought with a
price, therefore honor God, both in your bodies, and in your spirits: their
strongest Argument to persuade, being this and the like: That the love of God
which brings salvation unto all men, has appeared, teaching us, to deny all
ungodliness and unrighteousnes of men, and to live righteously, godly, and
soberly in this present world: that we should love as Christ has loved, who
gave himself an Offering and a Sacrifice for us: so that if we would try each
others Faith, we are to consider each others love; so much faith, so much love;
so much love, so much pure and undefiled Religion; extending it self to the
fatherles and to the Widow; to the hungry, the naked, sick, and imprisoned; it
being evident, that he who has this worlds goods, and suffers his brother to
lack, has not the love of God in him, yea though he have never so great parts
of knowledge, zeal, tongues, miracles, yet being void of love, he is nothing:
plainly manifesting that all other Religions, are but as defiled and impure in
comparison of this.

And these are the Doctrines, which make good the rejoyning of the Angels,
bringing glory to God in the highest, in earth peace, good will toward men:
These are sufficient, and in these do all sorts of Christians agree, and never
had disagreed but for false Teachers, Wolves in sheep Clothing; who crept in
to devour the flock: causing diverse strifes and contentions, about
genealogies, and about the Law, which made the Apostle abundance of trouble,
crying out, O foolish Galathians who has bewitched you; telling them plainly,
if righteousness came by the Law, then Christ dyed in vain; others, it should
seem, fell to observe Days and Times, Sabaoths and Weeks, justifying
themselves, and censuring others: provoking the Apostle to tell them, he was
afraid of them, that he had bestowed labor in vain upon them, earnestly
desiring them, to let no man deceive them, in respect of an holy day, or of the
new Moon, or of the Sabbath, etc.

The truth is, and upon experience it will be foudn a truth: that once exceed
these plain indisputable Doctrines, and you will be ever to seek; for though
it be a kind of happiness, to read in Genesis the proceedings of God toward
our first Parents, to Abel, Cayne, Enoch, to Noah and the world that perished
in the flood; to see his mighty power at the Confusion of Babell: his love to
Abraham and Sarah, to Isaac, Jacob, and the twelve Patriarks, to see their way
of worship, to observe his mighty wonders in Egypt, in the Wilderness, and in
the promised Land, under the Judges: Saul and David, Solomon, and the rest of
the Kings of Judah and Israel: To know with what power he spoke by his holy
Prophets in all times, even to John the Baptist.

Yet when we have done all, we must acknowledge, that very many things exceed
our understandings, and that we draw no comfort like unto this, that unto
Christ, do all these bear witness: and though we have great cause to bless
God, for those wonderful things we read of the life of Christ, of his wisdom,
goodness, and power; by which he beat down the wisdom craft, and policy of the
Scribes and Pharices, of the high Priest and great ones of the world: and
whereby he made it manifest, that he was indeed the Christ, yet draw we no
comfort like unto that, which the Apostles published by the power of the holy
spirit. the comforter promised by Christ before his Assention: because by this
dispensation of God, only, do we come to know the benefits of Christ's death,
and that he is the end of the Law for righteousness, and the propitiation for
our sins; whereby we have peace of Conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

We Read, with thankfulness to God, the Acts of the Apostles, all the Epistles
of Paul, of Peter, James, Jude, and the Epistles of John, and the Revelat. to
St. John: But we must still acknowledge, that there are very many things in
them all, which we apprehend not fully. We Read of Apostles, E^angelists,
Prophets, Pastors, and Teachers, and of the ordering and regulating of
Churches, and of gifts given to all these from on high; but not so plainly
expressed, as to leave the Conscientious without dispute, and difference
thereupon: nor so collected into any one Book, as to convince, that God now
under the Gospel, so exactly enjoined Church Government, as he did under the
Law; where Moses was expressly commanded to write particularly all that was
required, not leaving out so much as Candlesticks, Snuffers, or Besomes* And
when we come to compare the Churches, or their Pastors, and their abilities of
our times, with those we read of: or the infallible power by which they spoke,
with the uncertain Doctrines of ours, alas we must lay our hands upon our
mouths, and hide our faces, as children use to do, when they are discovered by
people of understanding, at their childish immitations, of Christnings and
Feastings; where, in a low and miserable weak form they counterfeit things
real: so that if we shall deal plainly with our selves, we must confess,
we are at a loss in these things, and that hence only is our rejoicing, That
we undoubtedly know Jesus Christ and him Crucified, and knowing him, account
all things as loss and dung in Comparison of him: and that we may be found in
him, not having our own righteousness which is of the Law, but the
righteousness which is of God in him: so that the whole Scriptures to us, is
as the Field mentioned in the Gospel, and this the JEWEL, for which the wise
Merchant, sold all that ever he had to purchase it.

And truly, if the Traders in Divine things, truly consider this, how learned
soever they are in Arts and Sciences, in all kinds of Readings and Languages,
and how mighty and skillful soever they would be thought in the Exposition,
opening, and interpretation of all places of Scripture, when they come to cast
up their account, possibly; nay, certainly, (if they are serious therein) they
will account all as nothing for this Pearl, which passes value, they will
sell All to purchase it; and rejoice exceedingly in the exchange, as the most
profitable that ever they made.

And this certainly would be done frequently by all who with honest and good
hearts Read the Scriptures; were they not kept from it by fase Teachers, who
hold them in suspense for their own advantage, ever raising, and starting new
Questions, and new Opinions, whereby men are ever learning, but never at rest
in the knowledge of his one necessary truth: but are tossed too and fro, with
every wind of Doctrine: and all by giving ear to those that call themselves
Preachers, but are not: that pretend to expound the Scriptures, when as they
raise nothing but doubts, and darken them; that say they Interpret, when they
are to seek for the meaning; being altogether doubfull and uncertain in all
they do.

And therefore much more happy are they, who read with honest and good hearts,
and only Read, and considerately lay to heart; giving no ear to these
charmers: these doubtful Eexpositors, these mocke-Preachers, with their
trumpery Sermons, stuffed with naught, but uncertainety, and fantastic
doctrines, which in the day of the necessity of man's Conscience, prove like a
broken Reed, that instead of help, further wounds.

Nor let any man henchforth wonder, whence so many several and strange
opinions should arise, by which the world becomes even rent and torn in
pieces? It is from this kind of Preachng, and false Exposition of the Holy
Scriptures. It being so, in more ancient times, with the Law and the old
Testament, as Petrus Cunaeus, (de Republ. Lib. 2. chap. 17.) brings to light:
affirming, That howsoever the Law was Read amongst them in the former times,
either in puplicke or in private, yet the bare Text was only Read, without
gloss or descant, Interpretatio Magistrorum nulla, commentatio nulla; but in
the second Temple, when there were no Prophets, then did the Scribes and
Doctors (mock Prophets, as our mock Preachers) begin to Comment, and make their
several Expositions on the holy Text: Ex quo natae disputationes and
sententiae contrariae; from whence (says he) sprung up debates, and doubtful
disputations: and most probable it is (says another upon him) that from this
liberty of Interpretation sprung up diversity of judgments, from whence arose
the several Sects of Pharisees, Essees and Saduces; who by their difference of
Opinions, did distract the multitude, and condemn one another.

Even so in these times, when as there are no true Apostles, Evaugelists,
Prophets, Pastors, or Teachers, endowed with power from on high, as all true
ones are; by which, they are enabled to divide the word of God aright, to stop
the mouths of gainsayers, and to say, thus says the Lord, thus speaks the
Lord, and not I, And if an Angel from Heaven, preach any other doctrine, let
him be accursed. In the absence of these, are crept in swarms of Locusts,
false Teachers, men of corrupt minds, making Merchandise of the blessed Word of
Truth, and for that wicked end, dress it up in what shape their Art or
Rehtorick can devise; and upon pretense of exposition, raise thousands of
doubts and disputes, write millions of books, and preach innumerable Sermons;
whereby the people are divided, and subdivided into Factions, Sects and
parties; and whereby the end of the Gospel, which directs only to peace and
love, is most unthankfully made use of, as a firebrand of quarrels and
dissentions.

In the mean time, the poor innocent Dove, that desirs to enjoy the peace of
his mind in this Vnum necessarium, that little Doctrine of Christ crucified, and
to walk in love, ever worshipping God in Spirit, and in the Truth,
dis-intangled from all forms, as things he finds uncertain, dis-ingaged from
all false Churches (and cannot find a true one) that in all things gives
thanks, and dares not pray, but for what he needs, nor join with any, where he
is not before agreed what to ask,; This innocent dove finds not a place to
rest his foot in, but is become the game of these birds of prey, these Ravens,
Vultures, and Harpies.

O that all ingenious men would lay these things to heart! that they would
look more exactly into these Churches, more boldly and firmly, trying,
examining and weighing them in the balance: that they would shake off that
veil of superstition, and reverend respect to men's persons; whereby they are
overawed into a high esteem of mere vanities, empty shells without kernells,
empty clouds that hold no water. That they would consider, how extremely
partial they are in judging of things; For, who is he, that does not
exceedingly condemn the impudence of Simon Magus, in offering to buy the holy
Spirit of God with money, purposely to have made a gain thereof; and yet can
daily see men counterfeit the having of the Spirit, and pretend to preach and
to pray by it; when as it is evident, they have it not, and yet are no whit
troubled at this, though they see it done also, even for filthy luchre, vain
glory, or other vile respects, as he intended.

But all are not a like guilty, many through weakness, and a preposterous
zeal, being carried with the stream and current of the times; and many there
are, who have run themselves quite out of breath, in searching after peace, and
rest, in the various ways of these Churches, and from one Church way to
another; but find none to comfort them, nothing to establish them; confessing,
that instead of real ordinances, they find only names; instead of power in
them, they find only forms, fashions, likenesses and imitations, mere
pictures, and Images without life, altogether dead and comfortless; and are
held up merely by the power of Art, craft, and policy of men, not without the
countenance of corrupt authorities, and oppressive Statesmen; who find it (as
it has ever proved) a notable means to devide the people, making use thereof,
to their wicked and tyrannous ends; But God in these times has had
instruments, to lay all kinds of delusion open: so that henceforth, if men
continue in these evil ways, they are altogether inexcusable.

Neither will men ever live in peace, and quietness one with another, so long as
this veil of false counterfeit preaching, remains before their eyes, nor
until the mock Churches are overturned and laid flat; For so long as men
flatter themselves in those vain ways, and puff themselves up with vain
thoughts, that they are in a way well pleasing to God, because they are in a
Church way, as they call it, or because they are able to speak long together
(which they call preaching) they are for the most part regardles of storing
their minds with truths real Christian virtue, little or nothing careing,
either for public Justice, Peace, or freedom amongst men; but spend their time
in endless disputes, in condemning and censuring those that are contrary
minded; whereby nothing but heats and discontents are engendered, backbiting and
snarling at all that oppose them, will neither buy, nor sell with them, if they
can choose, nor give them so much as a good look; but on all occasions are
ready to Censure, one to be carnal, another erroneous; one an Atheist, another
an Heretic, a Sectary, Scismatick, a Blasphemer, a man not worthy to live,
though they have nothing whereof to accuse him; which in the true Scripture
sense, will bear the title of an offense, but are stirred in their spirits
against him, because happily he speaks against their Churchway, and
frequently shows the vanity, and emptiness of those things wherein they
glory, and by which they distinguish themselves from other men.

So that it were much better for the Commonwealth, that all men's minds were
set at Liberty, from these entanglements, that so there might be an end of
wrangling about shaddows; for if men were once free from this Church-bondage,
they would by reading the Scriptures with such like considerations, as are
before expressed, soon come to be able to understand the intent, and
substantial scope thereof; and become substantial Christians; full fraught
with true Christian virtue, and real godliness, which would incline them to a
tenderness of spirit toward all those they saw in any error; make them to
compassionate men's failings, and infirmities; and be ready to help the
distressed. and any ways afflicted: it would enlarge their hearts toward all
men, making them like unto our heavenly Father, who causes his Sun to shine on
the just, and unjust: that gives to all men liberally, and upbraideth no man.

Certainly, were we all busied only in those short necessary truths, we
should soon become practical Christians; and take more pleasure in Feeding the
hungry, Clothing the naked, visiting and comforting of the sick, releeving
the aged, weak and impotent; in delivering of Prisoners, supporting of poor
families, or in freeing a Common wealth from all Tyrants, oppressors, and
deceivers, (the authors and promoters of all corruption and superstion) thereby
manifesting our universal love to all mankind, without respect of persons,
Opinions, Societies, or Churches; doubtless there were no way like unto this,
to adorn the Gospel of Christ; men and women so exercising themselves, and
persevering therein, might possibly deserve the name of Saints; but for men to
assume that title for being a Presbyter, an Independent, Brownist, Anabaptist,
or for being of this or that opinion, or of this or that form of Worship, or
for being able to Pray, and Preach (as they call it) three or four hours
together, venting their own uncertain notions, and conjectures, or for looking
more sadly, and solemnly then other people, or for dressing themselves after a
peculiar manner: or for pretending to have the Spirit of God, though they are
ever to seek about the meaning of the Scriptures: or for sucking in, and
sighing out reproaches, and slanders against their neighbors? proceeds from
mere pride and vanity of mind; when as the best of these put altogether, amount
not to so much, toward the making of a true Saint, as one merciful tender
hearted compassionate act, for Christ's sake does.

And therefore those who would truly honor God, let them not think, that he
will be flattered with words, or be served with lip service, with that which
costeth little or nothing; but let them resolve that he expects to be served
with no less then with all our heart, withal our might, and with all our
strength, to be honored both in our bodies, and in our spirits, for they are
his.

It is most certain, that men are first to know and understand, before they can
become practical Christians, and though the Scriptures are very plain and
full, as to necessary knowledge, yet the errors of weak and perverse teachers
do so abound, that it is a difficult thing to escape them, and to fall into a
profitable method of reading, and meditation of the word of God: wherein may
the considerations aforementioned, prove as profitable, as they are
conscionably intended; but doubtless the best way to perfect knowledge, is,
and will be, by endeavoring after meetings of people to confer and discourse
together (in a discreet, quiet, and well ordered way) upon necessary points
only: the way of preaching or long set speeches, being subject to abundance of
error, and inconvenience: and therefore it would be happy, that all wel-meaning
people would seriously set themselves to procure frequent and full meetings,
for increase of knowledge in all sorts of people, and no longer to depend,
either on the public, or congregationall Sermons, for information of their
understandings: it being evident, that they serve rather to dignifie the
Speakers, and to sway the hearers into what they please, then to any just or
necessary end.

And as every one increases in knowledge, let them know, that God has not
vouchsafed his word unto us, to make us talkers, or discoursers only; as the
manner of many knowing people is, who as soon as they arive to a good measure
of understanding, and are thereby freed from the burdens and oppressions,
which error and superstition had brought into their Consciences, instead of
being thankful to God for the same, by diligence in the ways of doing good;
they become careless, turning the goodness and truth of God manifested in his
word to Idleness, if not to wantonness, not caring what becomes of the
miseries of the times, or other men's sufferings; but ever after, live as in a
pleasing dream; these who ever they are, are to be looked upon as the most
unworthy of men, because the most ungrateful: the most opposite to the end of
their being, the vilest of Creatures, because sloathfull Christians: the best
things, being the worst, if once corrupted.

And therefore it will be very good, for every one to stir up the knowledge of
God that is in him, and to keep it alive by continual practice, upon all
occasions: practice in good and just and charitable things being that wherein
the Conscience is most delighted; so that if any propose to themselves any
happiness here in this life, it is to be found only in doing of good: the more
good, the better contented, and the greater the happiness, man being in
nothing like unto God, but in doing good, nothing is more acceptable to God,
nothing is more pleasant to Conscience, his vicegerent in us; to do good
therefore, and to distribute, forget not, for with such sacrifices God is well
pleased: whilst we have time and oppertunity, let us do good unto all men.

Let us all strive to go on before another in love, and let there be no other
strife at all amongst us; we wish with all our souls that all reproach,
despites and envyings amongst men might for ever cease, and that difference in
judgment, may no longer occasion difference in affection; there being in our
apprehension no cause at all; but that all men going in their several ways of
serving God, whether public or private, may nevertheless be free to
communicate in all civil Offices of love and true friendship, and cordially
join with any, for a public good; but if notwithstanding all that has been
endeavored, or has been said: this Generation of congregationall men shall
continue to puff, and swell through pride of heart, and to lift themselves up
into the Chair of the scornful, and as the man in Peter's Chair assume a
power of life and death over all opinions and ways not owned by them: as if
they were infallible judges of all controversies, making no scruple of blasting
men's good names and reputations, or of undoing of whose Families thereby: they
must then expect to be told their own, and be made appear to the world -- as
they are, -- not as they would be esteemed.

It being evident by what has been said, that although they have boasted
themselves to be rich, and increased with goods, and to have need of nothing;
yet, they are as the lukewarm Church of Laodicea, miserable, and wretched, and
poor, and blind, and naked -- and for all their bigg and swelling conceits of
parts, of gifts, of Saint-ship, of the Spirit, and (in effect) pharisaically
crying out, Lord we thank thee, we are not as other men, nor as those poor
Publicans, that receive all their knowledge of Divine things from the
Scriptures only, and are taught only thereby; Notwithstanding these bigg
swelling words, their Peacocks feathers, being thus plucked off, you see: and
they, will they, nill they, must also see, that they must be content at last,
to shake hands even with those poor Publicans; and acknowledge that they have
no other infallible Teacher of Divine things, but the Scriptures; and that they
partake no more of the Spirit, then what that blessed Word of the Spirit
planteth in them.

And if their consciences are awakened, will be enforced to forsake their
falling Churches: unless for politic ends, they shall stifle the power of
these Truths within them; choosing rather to perish in the rubbish, then to seem
to have bin so exceedingly mistaen; which will prove an unpardonable error;
For, however the best of men may err, yet they are the worst of men, that
persist in error, after the discovery.

And therefore, if there be any whose consciences shall be fully informed of
the vanity of these Churches; and yet for any ends shall continue to support
the reputation of them; let all such know, that those who dare be so impious,
as to stop the continual cry of their consciences, must necessarily desire in
their hearts there were no God, whose Uicegerent, Conscience is; which is the
most sad, and dangerous conditon that man can fall into in this life.

And certainly they will find it far better to forsake their tottering
immaginary structures: confess their emptines, and sinful imitation, taking
shame unto themselves* and giving glory unto God, whose name and power they
have much diminished, hy affirming those to be Churches which are not, those
Pastors and Preachers which are not, those Saints which are not: his blessed
Word to be but a dead Letter: that to be his Word, which is but conjecturall
Sermons; and in censuring those to be erroneous and carnal Christians, who
have more warrant for what they do then themselves; And then by a more
considerate, ingenious, and Christian-like carriage, to make amends for the
future, which would very much rejoice the herrts of all* that love the Lord
Jesus in sincerity, whose Truth and Glory will be advanced by the Scriptures;
when all the roving, wild and wandering immaginations of men's spirits, shall
vanish, and come to naught.
