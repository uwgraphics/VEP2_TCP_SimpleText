GOING NAKED, A SIGN.
OH Church of England! This is unto thee, who live in oppression and cruelty,
pride and covetuousnesse; a day of misery is coming upon thee, thy nakedness
and shame is coming upon thee as an armed Man, from which no man can hide thee,
neither Hills nor Mountains shall be able to hide thee in this the Day of the
Lord, neither shall the Clefts of the Rocks preserve thee from the Day of the
Lords Controversy with thee; Thy nakedness and thy shame is near to come upon
thee, from it thou shall not fly: Oppression and cruelty has been as a Staff
for thee, but the Lord is risen to break thy Staff of oppression, and thou
shall be left naked though thou have seemed to be the glory of the Nations with
thy deceitful Covers,, but now thou shall be left naked, and Nations shall be
ashamed of thee: Howl and weep ye Teachers, for the Lord is gathering his
people from you, and ye shall devour his flock no more: The Day is coming upon
you, that none shall buy your Wares any more ye Merchants of Babylon: All your
scarlet color the Lord our God is coming to take off: Then your nakedness
shall appear to many Nations, and you shall sit as a Widow, and there shall
be none to comfort you; Distress and anguish shall take hold upon you, and
pain as a Woman in travel, and is not able to bring forth, so shall your misery
come upon you: The Decree of the Lord is gone out against all unrighteousness,
he will surely reward every one according to their works, for as a Troop of
Robbers lie in wait for a Man, so a company of Priests by consent lie in wait
to murder the Innocent Lambs of God, and for their sakes the Lord is risen in
his mighty power to break the bonds of wickedness, and to set the oppressed
free, for the Lord has heard the groaning of his seed, and he is risen to
deliver to bring it out of Captivity, and from under the taskmasters, where his
seed has been long oppressed by unreasonable Men: But the Lord will spare no
longer, but he will reward the Oppressors double into their bosoms, and his
seed he will deliver.

Oh howl and weep your day is far spent, Night is coming upon you that you
shall not have a Vision, and nothing shall be left to cover you: As naked shall
you be spiritually, as my body has been temporally naked in many places in
England, as a sign of the nakedness* and shame that is coming upon the Church
of England, who lives in Oppression and cruelty, and all who lift up a weapon
for her shall fall in the shame with her, which will surely come to pass; So
all sober people consider your ways, and turn to the light which comes from
Jesus, that with it you may be gathered unto the Lord from the false Teachers
to the teachings of the Lord, from the false worships to the worship of the
Lord in spirit and in truth; For a necessity was laid upon me from the Lord God
of Life and power to be a sign: But before I was given up to the thing, it was
as death unto me, and I had rather, if it had been the Lords will, have dyed
then gone on in this service; But when the word of the Lord came unto me
saying, Go on and prosper, It was sweet unto me, as the honey, and the honey
Comb. And blessed says Christ are they that hears my word, and keeps it.

William Simpson.
