The Highway to Peace:
AStonished with the present condition of the times, when all men's pens write
(unpunished) what they please, without serious contemplation of convenience;
after much amazement, I recollected my thoughts, and esteemed it a duty to add
this drop to the Ocean of what has been printed, with prayers first to the
highest, to direct me to write a word or two, to induce an universal peace in
this piece of ground, which has no limits but sea, heartily wishing I were a
wise Esculapius to express apples of gold, and pictures of silver; if it prove
an antidote to cure the violent distempers, I shall be exceedingly glad, and if
I labor in vain, I have discharged my conscience, though with much sorrow.

The Physician can judge better of a Patient, by experience in others; as a
distempered man is more sensible of folly, by seeing Bedlam; therefore I set
before your eyes as in a glass to behold the pest ilent disease of great
B^ittaine, what mortal cause was in the example, may be avoided in this
Climate.

While some make the whole body desperate by clandestine plots* and pamphlets
unrecoverable, on purpose to make Parliamentary Authority despicable, that no
physic can help the distemper; others as ambitious Solons, new model the
State, or imitate the burner of a goodly Ephesian Temple to be famous in after
stories, much like Quacksalvers, heal an ulcer by a sword thrust through the
bowels, which may kill the body, and not cure the Tumor; and therefore in the
serious view of present affairs, this age resembles the Roman Senate, tired
with civil mutinies, groaning with burdens of several Armies, and new
impositions, and torn in pieces by envy of subdivided factions, by which
weakened in authority, fell weary of the intolerable weight, let the government
by a strange dotage into the power of the boundles ambition of Julius Caesar,
who subdued the Senatorian greatness, by singling out particulars, whom joined
he could not prejudice.

For this Parliament (the best of all since the conquest) had power and
opportunity to free the Nation from slavery; a sickness almost incurable, had
not the physic of a just defensive war procured an incredible success.

The first they did in the edifice, was to deface Hyerarchy, before they could
cleanse the Church from rubbish, and dross, sullied in time of Popery, waying
several forms in the balance of the Sanctuary, fixed upon Presbytery; but
finding a great distaste from the severity in the peoples pallet, mixed with the
vinegar, sweet milk, to abate the sharpness, and mittigate popular
discontent, with appeal from the Clergy to lay men more pleasing, then the
reformed Churches of Europe used: Behold though there was analay, and their
stomakes puked, and could not digest alteration of Bishops, notwithstanding
Presbytery seemed Apostolical, because the words (without worldly pomp^) and
Presbyter are Sunonymaes: So that a new tropicke is turned, and the time is
come, all Mountains to be abased, and obstacles taken a way; for the
conqueror of hearts assailes all our Parliamentary power to let into Great
Britain a new light and sunshine against all humane power, for supposing one
as lawful as the other.

All this effected the high Counsel lanching the ship of the S^a^e over many
Parliamentary tempests, and various Rocks, God seemed to be displeased in the
very frontispeece of that Fabric, with the Presbyterian pride, and insolent
austerity of the Elders to their Superiors.

For the great Lord of the universe raised some Syraphycall spirits to make a
new discovery for ordering the Communion of Saints more agreeable to the word,
then usually known in the world; a controversy I will not now discuss, the
scope of my discourse tending another way; namely to desire a settled peace, and
to show the great danger we run for reviving a new war by Salimandrine
spirits, opposing each other without a mild dispute, and pleasing converse: For
the people lissening to the Pastors violence of spirit, are set on fire to
quarrel with all that hold the contrary, who from scolding fall to blows,
from buffets to swords and gunnes, by parties siding against parties, having a
just ground, conceived to fall out about the breach of protestation, and
brotherly, Covenant: they are engaged to the Scotch Nation, whom I heartely
wish may have good satisfaction by making manifest, that the order to be used
by the Ministers, approaches nearer the holy Scripture then theirs, and
differs only in form, not essence; so the binds of amity may be kept in unity
of spirit; though divided in judgment and opinion, to the end the
protestation, and Covenant made in the presence of the Almighty, rise not in
judgment against us, to make us guilty of the crime of Laodislaus the
Emperor, falsifying his faith with the Turk; who was slain in the battle and
place where the agreement was solemnly taken, and broken; whilst some are for
Apollo, and others for Caephas, yet both for Christ; the Scots partake with
some faction here, to cause England swim in blood, and hinder the building of
Gods house, or be a Rrinora to the glory and felicity of the visible Church in
the Martyrdom of many thousands.

I fear therefore lest this great contestation between Independent and
Presbyter cause a fatal Tragedy, as happened to the Clergy and Laiety about
celebration of Easter such heart burning, and great persecution; for that, as a
branch growing from that tree of division, sprang up the most horrible Arrian
Heresy, which troubled the Church many years, till God raised a Counsel,
dispelled the Egyptian darkness by distinguishing the words, (...) from,
(...), which appeased the irreconcilable difference projected of two letters
by Satan, to make a schism, and our Saviors death for salvation invallid: so
I trust God will raise Evangelicall spirits to bring that glorious woman out of
the Wilderness (prophesied of in the Revelation) who may be Midwives to
deliver her of the most ardent truth, to cure our frensicall part, that the
fullness of the Gentiles may more speedily ensue, and consequently the remnant
of the Jews be gathered.

And certainly the Devil has stirred up our heresies on purpose to break
the neck of Parliaments by the instigation of diverse foreign Jesuits come
over, who add fuel to our flame, either by Sermons or Counsels, and
consequently will endanger the Parliament, as did the Arminian in Holland.

Surely we are in the same danger the States of Holland were, when Philip the
second of Spain acknowledged them a free State; so as soon as it had life by
the vigilance of Grave Maurice (a brave and wise Soldier) the miracle was, it
had not burial by the Artifices, and faction of Barnevelt, the chief of which
he cut off with great celerity, and so dispersed the rabble who intended their
ruin.

The Parliament after a long and dangerous voyage, brought to a good pass by
the war ended, there arose a difficulty to disperse and dispose the Army,
long diverted from sending supplies into Ireland, by homebred troubles,
because they had not paid the Soldier, who were unwilling to disband without
their arreares: A wonder an Army so glorious (in the opinion of all) should be
dismissed without salory: in consideration whereof the houses very well resented
their worth and valor; yet found they wanted ready moneys, and therefore were
forced to solicit the City (where they might command) to issue money on good
security to reward the Soldiery; but their answer was, they would not till
they were cashered, for some in London were contrary in faction to the armed
forces, and the Army to the City, affirming (as it was just) in plain words
they would not lay down their weapons till they received their pay in part,
and security for the rest, fearing to be served as the reduced Officers, for a
time without money, meat, and clothes.

So that there was a double Set to be played, one to get moneys, and another to
disband; a discontented victorious Army, denied the one, and disappointed of
the other; the Parliament was put to their trumps, and forced to play the game
another way.

By this time the great Counsel saw it impossible at one and the same time to
satisfy the Soldier, and please the City, because some few discontented
persons (that well ordered City is not without) growing imaged against the
supreme Judges, sent a number of unruly Prentices to force their unjust
demands (a president without pattern, and violence never heard of) this caused
both the houses to have their own^ guards, and not the Cities, of purpose to
secure their persons, debate freely, prevent future molestation, and remedy
repining mischiefs likely to invade the peace of the State.

By this it may appear plainly the hindrance of our prosperity lies in the
plots of malcontents, not in the Parliament nor Army the desire of the one is
to send, and the willingness of the other speedily to be sent away, and not
like a vulture to eat out the bowels of the Country by free quarter, a
charge only for the peoples just defense against foreign or domestic foes
which might invade or disturb their quiet.

Yet at the present there wanted not pestilent spirits would set a bone twixt
Parliament and Army, and twixt both and Scotland; though our wise Senate labor
with might and maine to settle a common peace here, and in both Nations, as
his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairefax, and Counsel of War endeavor to bring
the Soldier to obedience, and give content to the Scot.

Whereupon the Soldier guarded the Parliament, and secured the Tower, that no
tumults molest the Parliamen, nor infest the City.

By this time the wisdom of the great Counsel has retrived (by woeful
experience) the haunt of those who slight their endeavors (though with much
expense, toylsome labor of body, and danger of person) they continue, then
continue to bring to pass the happy condition of Church and State, when others
seek more their own ends, then Gods glory, and good of the Kingdom.

For such people it is impossible to please; for where inconstancy possesses
the heart (a long travel to bring felicity to perfection) is most irksome,
never considering affairs of so great consequence cannot be effected, but with
long labor, and much reluctance.

So that the people jealous of a new war, raised on the basis of their late
payments are stirred up with an earnest desire to be rocked in two cradles,
affected most to wit, ^ase with rest and peace, knowing full well war brings
a consumption to a Kingdom how rich soever; especially the wise seeing some
Countries without corn, others without stock, some without Tennants, others
without money, some without Cattle, others burdened with free quarter, all
concommitants of Civil War, which makes all long (like a woman with child)
to be brought a bed of a well grounded peace; hoping as in that last seven
years of our Henry the third, what mischief, and dissolation war had caused
in almost thiry years ill government, was repaired by aprentiship of years,
for which he was called the Justinian of his time.

So now if the storm were past, and seven years never so unfortunate, the
Common weal may become in a short space fat and fair: So that nothing can be
more cordial then to have no Army at all; for the people fear that power may
become dangerous, when Land and Sea are invested in the person of one, that
what is given to a servant, may be usurped as an absolute Master; as Henry the
7 made the right of his Queen his own, and so buried her title; not knowing
where Religion is plac'st in the heart, there can be no treachery in the
action, and what is lent for a time will be restored to the proprietor.

Therefore I beseech all to consider, the cause of our danger is the wrath of
God which hanges over our heads (as a dismal cloud) ready to discharge upon us
for many horrid opinions, and blasphemies; as swearing, profanation of
Sabbaths, drunkenness, fornication, adultery, will worship, formality, hatred,
malice and liberty to do what pleases sense, though never so contrary to the
eternal Law, the least of which are heavy enough to pull down the greatest
judgment, namely sin punished in committing of sin; O that we could (with
Jeremy) shed a fountain of tears!

Certainly it is not the malignity of the air causes the Plague, plotting
and humane device, war, combining of the Grasier and Farmer, scarcity, but
our grievous sins, and want of love bring upon us these evils; wherefore let
us leave our transgressions, and be charitable one to the other; for hatred
brings division, distraction, mutinies, opposition, and armed forces; let us
have care especially of tender consciences, which will be sooner convinced by
sweetness then severity; let not Presbyter hate Independent, Independent
Presbyter, Protestant Papist, Papist Protestant, Brownist Anabaptist, nor
Anabaptist Brownist; but let all reason together* with mildness, the best
still to confute error, and fittest means to work out truth, as the steel
gently strikes out of the flint, fire falling upon tinder of good desires,
kindles the match of pious affections, and so lights the candle of knowledge to
show the beaten way God has appointed to walk in, if not a new yet a brighter
way: so shall the noone day of understanding be cleared, and no twilight of
error and mistake.

Fot swavity causes Iaphet to dwell in the Tents of Sem, fulfilling the divine
Prophecy of these latter times, 11 Esaias. 6 78 9.10.11. The Wolf shall dwell
with the Lamb, the Leopard lie down with the Kid, and the Lion, and the
Fatling together, and they shall not hurt nor destroy, says God, in all my
holy Mountain: this plainly insinuates that all severity and harshnesse
should be banished from Gods people, and love in sweetness be toward one
another, for the Wolf, Leopard, and Lion are cruel beasts of pray, which
devour the Lamb, Kid, and Fatling are innocent creatures; so that if the
cruel, and innocent shall agree in all Gods Mountainer, by which is meant his
Church: Then tender consciences ought not to be forced, nor private duties in
Families prohibited, that God may bless this State, that piety may abound, and
Parliament and City not oppose each other; for severity causes distractions,
where Magistrares have no power, nor Nobility and Gentry respect, holding all
things in common: And if severity of Presbyters rage over weak consciences,
they may usurp the temperall power over persons, estates, and purses, and
become as Antichristian as the Popes of Rome, and worse then our late Bishops;
for when the Clergy rules over the consciences of people, temperall power may
out face, never govern, and so by insensible degrees become humblers of
States, a course contrary to Apostolical Doctrine which prohibits to Lord over
Gods heritage when no man can know the conscience but a Diety, no more then the
heart unless they had the infalibility of the spirit; so by this they trod the
beaten path of the Roman Church when the Popes raised the mount of Supremacy
over Kings, and Potentates, a pride would not be pulled down, though assaied by
many Emperors and Princes.

If Parliament and Army are at a distance, the one has no power to command,
nor the other will to obey.

When the Parliament is against the City, the Cities Charter may be questioned,
Monopolies and Impositions will be on Merchandise, and manufactures to
overthrow Merchants and tradsemen, and the Parliament shall not have the
Citizens purses at their command with their will and ability as they ought; for
if the Physician and Patient should fall together by the ears, the Physic may
be as well poison as wholesome, for the high Senate purges Monopolies, and
vomits up Impositions that trade and merchandise may flourish.

The City and Country bring branches from the tree of one root, ought to
accord as loving brothers, and are then happy; but if they fall at variance,
and disturb each others precious peace, what a world of mischief will ensue?
Besides bloodshed; how can the City vent their foreign commodities? When the
Country may live of their homebread; or how can the Country sell their broad
clothes, stuffes, fustians, cheese, wheat, malt, or cattle, with diverse
others (too long) to recite?

If City and Army stand at a distance, and oppose each other, the one may
starve the other, stopping provisions by Land and Water, nor the Army have pay,
but from the Magazin of the City to maintain their forces.

Lastly if England and Scotland have a war, they will never be reconciled,
but become goades in one another sides, revive deadly fewd, and (which is worse
for us) Scotland will batch a portall to let in foreign enemies, as French,
Dutch, Spaniard, and Dane, to cause the seat of the war to be here, more
advantageous to the invader, then the invaded; and more over meet here with a
strong Presbyterian Party to assist them, made angry and revengefull against
others by Pulpits.

On the contrary side, the Scots shall find us hardy, resolute, valiant, and
encounter with an invincible Army, whom God has blessed, and I hope will: and
certainly I do not see what color the Scots have to invade us covenanting
solemnly to assist us; for when they side with a party, they will ruin
themselves to destroy us; for they shall add fuel to make a flame, when they
should quench the fire.

They cannot come on our English ground, till our Parliament vote them; or if
they shall invade us without our consent, they are to be reputed enemies,
violators of peace, plunderers of our Country, to enrich themselves by our
poverty; let them know, their intrusion without command of Parliament revives
the noble tenure of Escuage, which many of the Kingdom hold by, to serve
against them with horse and foot, till they be beaten out, the number of those
who hold by that service (by ancient survey) have been computed forty thousand
horse and foot, and if such Tennants shall refuse they forfeit their estates.

Do they conceive King Charles will protect a Nation that sold him? Or those
that prised him more then gold? Moreover every wise man will rather join with
rich then with poor, his Majesty's revennues being yearly a Million here, not
there a hundred thousand pounds. I have spoke this because they threaten us
with Declarations; yet I honor the Nation, and desire they may have
satisfaction to a tittle; but if they shall persist, and nothing shall satisfy
them but blood, they will lose their arreares, get nothing but blows, and set
up their rest upon one battle (out of their power to raise another;) nor do I
see what safe retreats they have, but what is gotten by blood, and so make the
addage true, they come for naught but our goods, not to right our wrongs, but
to fight with us, not to settle religion, but for lucre and gain.

O foolish England, will ye nourish serpents in your bosoms, ambitious to be
Lords of your estates? Will you aid and assist those that will ruin your
Kingdom? And will you become traitors to your own Country? I assure you the
Law of England will make you so; this I have spoken rather to deter their
illegal invasion, then provoke them: for the force of all my mind shall carry
it self to persuade brothers to agree in unity, and to assist one another wi^h
hearts, lives, and fortunes in a just and pious war desired of both; for I
honor the Nation, and should be grieved, people of one Island should be cut in
two pieces, brothers in Christ should become mortal enemies, who (jointly) are
able to vanquish France, or Spain. I humbly beseech God to reconcile us
together; let the lamentable example of us, and Ireland be before our eyes, a
back door to let in a foreign enemy subjects of the same Sovereign, though
opposite in religion, as in their minds, of whom it has been said, that they
were good servants; but when they got the key of power into their hands are bad
Masters, governed by one, (indeed) no Law, witness the unnatural bloodshed
there, how can barbarous cruelty be revenged, as long as we have civil war?

Moreover an Army divided cannot stand, therefore my humble suite to the
General, Council of war, Agitators, and Common Soldier is, to hold together,
who joined are a sheafe of arrows, but disjoined may sheath their swords in
one another bowels, or be vanquished; for then martial law will be of no
force and validity; how often have the Roman Cohorts, and Turkish Jannisaries,
chose new Emperors, killed their Commanders, and Generals, and at last they
ruined one another? the sword is a good servant, but a bad Master.

Or if the Soldier and Country jangle together, the Army will become odious,
and none willing to harbor them, much less give free quarter.

Likewise if the Parliament be divided (as a house) it cannot stand, the Rights
of Parliaments and Subjects will be destroyed, and they utterly vanquished, as
the Roman Senate by Caesar, then shall all wickedness go scotfree and
unpunished.

Certainly, Monarchy must not infringe the liberty of the people, nor people
destroy Monarchy.

For the composition of our government is partly Monarchiall, partly
Aristocraticall, and will not admit of a dominion solely in the people, as it
appeared plainly in the 15 year of Edw. 3. when they fell at variance in the
choice of great Officers of State, they turned the course from the people into
the royal channel; the Philosophers stone may turn iron and brass into gold
and silver; but not gold and silver into baser mettalls, no more can the
Sovereign power be transferd on the people, nor the right of the people
converted to the Sovereign; for then Kings (without Law) may do what they
list, have power of life at their pleasure; on the other side if power were in
the ordinary sort there would be Anarchy, and total confusion, therefore are
the Laws, that Kings may govern their Subjects with equity and justice, as
the Subject obey the Sovereign, and the King love and preserve the Subjects
lives and estates, by a legal way not fancy or pleasure: for the Laws are
Judges betwixt King and Subject, and Subject and Subject, otherwise the
Kingdom will perish, rich tread down the poor, widow and fatherless will
lose their right, people be oppressed? property utterly lost, and Religion will
turn Atheism.

The Commonwealth is a body (wherein are head and members) and King and
Subjects, who ought to have a sympathy and fellow feeling one of another
wants, and communicate to each other all the good they can; all degres (as
notes in music) make a harmony of love, depend on, and sweetly relate to
others; as the stars in the firmament of several magnitudes agree in quality
and nature with the seven Planets, or as the heavens, where God is supreme,
are Archangels, and Angels, ministringto each other.

Wherefore my thrice humble suite is to King, Parliament, City, Country, Army,
and Scotland, to unite in love, and join together against foreign and
domestic enemies of the State, that riches may merease, the Kingdom may be
well governed, Religion flourish, and God be honored, otherwise we shall be
like a great animal, as the Duke of Rohan says, which does nothing but
destroy it self, when two so brave Kingdoms shall lay violent hands and
murder one another.

Especially my humble prayer to my native Country, is to live in amity amongst
themselves. A people have been the glory of Europe, conquerors of France,
vanquishers of Palestina from the Saracens, defenders of the Protestant
Religion* who (I fay) have set the Crown of France on the head of Hen. 4. at
the expense of that Famous Queen Eliz. the glory of her sex) and by the
prowess of our brave Norrice, and the English Cavalry, opposed Spain in all
her glory, and at last brought her upon her knees, have been the greatest
Antagonists of Rome, Protectors of the 15 Provinces, a safe sanctuary for the
exiled Protestants, and inferior to no Country in valor.

God give th^s Counsel above a command; let us embrace it, and love one
another with due respect, duty to whom duty, and love to all, that future
proof may not turn discourses into a sanguine die, nor peace into bloody war;
so shall our swords be turned into plowshares, spades, and instruments of
husbandry, and right trodden down, shill be revived.

And I humbly entreat you not to look so much to errors past, as forwards;
carry your selves like wise, and brave men, for fear while we look to punish
others, we receive a blow shall take away power of punishment, and life it
self: And when a calm comes you may lock upon Delinquents with a severe face
of justice; and after every man may have distributed to him the dole of his due
birthright; therefore let not the quarrelling Knave win a Catastrophe in our
State, but the best of cards prevail for order, peace, and piety. Amen.

Gloria Patri, Filio and Spiritui sancto, maximam pacem Ecclesiae and
Republicae toto cord and animo opto.
FINIS.
