follows.

In respect of the present troubles of the times (which has continued for
diverse years last past) the means of the said Hospital has many ways
failed, ( viz) for want of charitable Benevolences, which have formerly been
given (by bountiful and well disposed Persons) which are now ceased, and
likewise very few legacies are now given to the relief of Hospitals; Also the
Rents and Revenues thereunto belonging, are and have been very slackly and ill
paid by the Tenants, who are not able to hold their Leases by reason of the
several Charges and Taxes laid upon them. Moreover the Children of the said
Hospital are not now employed to do their service at Burials as formerly (and
frequently) they have been, which was a great help toward their relief and
maintenance: yet notwithstanding there has been admitted into the said
Hospital within these three years last past 447 Children, by reason of these
hard, miserable, and uncomfortable times, the great number of poor,
distressed, and needy suitors, which number of Children now upon present
charge, is more than the Hospital is well able to maintain, unless it please
the Lord to raise further means, that the times become better, and charity
do more increase.

Hospital, of maimed Soldiers, and other diseased persons, to the number of --

THere has been brought to the Hospital of Bridewell, within the space of one
whole year last past of wandering Soldiers, and other Vagrant people, to the
number of -- 521

Many whereof have been very chargeable to the said Hospital, for Apparel,
sick diet, and Surgery, besides the ordinary diet, and other provisions and
charges expended about them, which could not be avoided by reason of their
necessities; and many of them have been passed into their Countries, with
Clothing and Apparel to cover their nakedness, which could not be otherwise
considering their miseries, nor they thence passed without such charge. And
there are now kept and maintained, in Arts and Occupations, and other several
works and labors, at the charge of the said Hospital, Apprentices and other
persons, to the number of -- 188

The Hospital of Bethlem is of great Antiquity, use, and necessity, for
keeping and curing distracted persons, who are of all other the most miserable,
by reason of their wants, both for soul and body, and have no sense thereof.

The charge thereof is very great, there being kept and manintained with
Physic, Diet, and other relief, 52. distracted persons constantly at least,
besides the charge of Servants to look to them, they being most unruly and not
able to help themselves; and the Rents and Revenues of the said Hospital
being very small, not amounting to two third parts of the yearly charge, and
therefore this Hospital is a fit object of charity, there having been of
late by the blessing of God, upon the charge of the said Hospital, and the
care of those that are entrusted with the said distracted people, diverse
reduced to their former senses.
