June 13. at 8 in the morning. 1648
To Lieutenant General Cromwell.
SIR,
WHilst the Enemy, under the Command of Goring and Sir Charles Lucas were in
Essex, they had a solemn Debate how to carry on their Affairs; The Result
whereof is, That their Army shall by no means engage in a Fight, but speedily
go to the North to join with Langdale; That all endeavors shall be used they
may have the KING in their Army: That the City be set upon a Common Hall,
thereby to engage them upon cutting throats. They express much joy at the
Members being called into the House; say that things work as they would have
them; And the House will in short time Vote down the Army That in cipher by the
dependence and connection, seems to be invective, and conclusive against the
late recalled Members and enlarged Aldermen as the chief obstructers of
supplies to the Army.
. The 687 743 or most of them 006 726 in the 785 21 53 177 756 Counsel with
them. The Recorder, Sir John Maynard, and Copley, sat in the House Yesterday.

Mr. Speaker,
THe numbers at and about Pontefract are They are now grown treble that number,
and within a while will be of strength to receive Fairfax's whole Army.
230 Horse, and 400 Foot. They increase daily; with whom we hear Goring is
resolved to join, and Langdale's Body also. Our Magazine is so empty that we
are afraid to descend to particulars. The Countries are like to be speedily in
a lost condition. We desire an effectual supply of Men, Money, Arms, etc. that
our Forces may be looked upon as an Army, not as a defensive Militia: without
which we may foresee and lament the sad and sudden consequences, but not
prevent them.

Signed, Francis Valentia. Edw: Rodes. Will: Alanson. C. Fairfax. Hen: Cholmley.
