An OATH taken by the Gentry and Inhabitants of the City and County of YORK.
I A. B. do herehy Testify and Declare, That our Sovereign Lord King Charles
is the true and lawful King of England, and of all His other Dominions; and
that neither the two Houses of Parliament, the People, nor any part of them,
have any Power or Authority over Him or the Crown: Neither ought they or any
of His Subjects of this Kingdom of England, or His other Dominions upon any
pretense whatsoever to take up Arms against his Sacred Majesty, His Person,
His Crown, His Generals or Soldiers authorized by Him, nor may they by any
Authority or pretense whatsoever make or levy War within this Kingdom, or
his other Dominions, or any way use his Royal Authority or Name for that
purpose, without his evident and public consent before obtained. And I do
further Swear, That I will bear true Faith and Allegiance to His Sacred
Majesty and His Crown, and to my Might and Power will assist Him, His
Generals, and all under their Command, against all such as have taken or shall
take up Arms against Him, or them, or that have or shall take up Arms within
this Kingdom, without His Majesty's evident, public, and real Authority:
And especially against Robert Earl of Essex, and Ferdinando Lord Fairefax,
(pretended Generals for the Parliament,) and all their Associates and
Confederates, and all others whatsoever, that derive not their Authority by
particular Commissions from His Majesty and His Generals. And I do further
Declare from the bottom of my heart, That diverse of the Scottish Nation having
presumed to enter into this Kingdom in a Warlike manner, without His Majesty's
evident, and public Authority first obtained and published: I will readily
and to the utmost of my ability, with the hazard of my Life and Fortunes,
assist His Majesty, His Generals, and all under their Commands, in Resisting,
Opposing, and Pursuing such Scots in an Hostile way as Rebels and Traitors
against His Majesty, and Enemies to the Crown of England. And I do further
Swear, That I will to my power assist and defend all such as shall take this
Oath in pursuance of the same, and particularly defend this City and Garrison
of York, and during my residence there, oppose all such as shall make any
attempt against it, and all such Plots, and Designs as shall come to my
knowledge, that may be prejudicial to His Majesty's Service, or destructive to
the Forces raised by His Majesty's Commissions, I will from time to time
discover to His Majesty's General or the Commander in chief of this County,
and in their absence to the Chief Officer for the time being of this Garrison.
And all this I do unfainedly Swear, without any equivocation, or mental
reservation. So Help me God.
