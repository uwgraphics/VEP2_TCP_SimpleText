The young Gallants Tutor Or, An Invitation to Mirth.
Here is an A^^dote against allsadness,
And a sweet Motive unto joy and gladness,
For mirth dorth to our lives such pleasure bring*
It makes us live as happy as a King,
From our fore fathers we this Maxim borrow,
An ounce of Mirth is worth a pound of Sorrow,
Tune of, The Delights of the Bottle. With Allowance,





AWay with the causes of ri^^es and ca^es,
That po^son our spirits ^ shooten our rears
Be that does sit ^^^ing o'^ ill gotten wealth
It pleases his fa^c^ but ruins his health,
Then perish all Fopps by sobrie^y dulled
while he that is merry reigns Prince of the world.
Mirth cheri^h^ l^^^ in the old and the young,
and makes every minute both ^^ (...)d long,
^r he that is inclined to be sober and sad,
A thousand to one but in time ^e'l grow mad,
Then perish all fopps by sobriety dulled
While he that is merry reigns Prince of the worl^
He that is but endued with one scruple of wit,
Can tell you that mirth like a Monarch does sit,
Enthroned in a palace of pleasure and ease,
To welcome young Gailants and Ladies to pleas^
Then perish all fopps by sobriety dulled,
While he that is merry reigns Prince of the worl^


The life of Canary does cherish our Souls*
Whilst that we carouse it in plentiful bouls
It fills us with courage both active and free,
And fits us for service in every degree,
Then perish all fopps by sobriety dulled,
While he that is merry ^^igns Prince of the world
We keep Ladys company just when we please,
And Kevel like princes in pleasure and ease
We pass the time merril^ day after day,
And month after month till the year slides away
Then perish all fopps by sobriety dulled
While he that is merry reigns prince of the world
The mighty god Cupid and Ba^^us agree,
To crown with delight all the noble and free,
When Venus grows froward because she is so fair
We then to the tents of great Baccus repair,
Then perish all fopps by sobriety dulled
while he that is merry reigns Prince of the world.
With Love and good liquor our hearts we do cheer
Can^ry and Claret Cock Ale and March beer,
I^'t were not for these we should have a dull sense
Of what shall betide us a hundred year hence,
Then perish all fopps by s^briety dulled,
While he that is merry reigns prince of the world
The joys of good fellowship keeps us alive,
The more we do fuddle the better we thrive,
To Frollick all day makes us sleep well at night,
^ur stomachs are ^ull though our heads may be light
Then perish all fopps by sobriety dulled
While he that is merry reigns prince of the world


Flint Glasses and Bottles are pleasant to view
To see the wine sparkle and of a brisk hue,
Will tempt a dull miser as much as his gold
But that he is afraid to be poor when he is old,
Then perish all fopps by sobriety dulled,
While he that is merry reigns prince of the world
What strange opposition in nature we find,
That some all their life time to mirth are inclined
Whilst others sit mopcing and neds must confess
They have no enjoyment of what they possess,
Then perish al^ Fopps by sobriety dulled,
While he that is merry reigns prince of the world
The pleasant debauches of love are most sweet,
When passion and Guineyes with beauty we meet
But yet the good sack is of noble renown,
And pleases as well as the Miss of the Town,
Then perish all Fopps by sobriety dulled,
while he that is merry reigns Prince of the world
Since Tippling and kissing does now rule the roast
Of freedom and pleasure we bravely can boast,
Whilesche that is sullen and knows no delight,
Oppressed is with sorrow by day and by night,
Then perish all Fopps by sobriety dulled,
While he that is merry reigns Prince of the world
Then for to conclude since that mirth does prevail
To mig^t^ ^ack bottle weel drink without fail,
Lets hug our delight that the health may go round
In which all our sorrows ^ cares we will drown^
Then perish all Fopps by sobriety dulled
While he that is merry reigns Prince of the wo^^^
