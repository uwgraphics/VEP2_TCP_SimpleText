Warranted Tidings, From Cork, in Ireland, the 16. of Iaunary, 1641.
COncerning (these particulars) the taking of the Town, and Castle of
Enishannon from the Rebels, by Sir Simon Harcourt, and Sir Thomas Temple, with
a notable Victory over the Rebel Mac-Cartie at Enishannon Foord: Mack-Con the
Rebels attempt upon the Town of Bandon Bridge, and their happy Defeat by Sir
Richard Grinfield.

Sunday, Ian. 16. Sir Simon Harcourt, and Sir Thomas Temple, hearing that the
late risen Rebel, Dominick Mack Carty was drawing toward the Town and Castle
of Enishannon: with intent to victual and man it better, as we conceived:
considering how near that Castle stands unto Kingsale, lately recovered, and
how bad an enemy likely to prove, if we should suffer the Rebels, not only to
neastle there, but even to pass by our door, and to relieve them in a
Bravado, desired of God dispensation for breach of the Sabbath, and after some
short prayers, and recommending our selves unto God: with refreshing our bodies
with such food, as the condition of the time, and place, would permit: We
advanced two hundred Horse, and fifteen hundred Foot, and five small field
Pieces with this equipage; we came unto the foord of Enishannon, being very
exceeding broad, but not very deep, hard chalky clay, being the siedge of the
Foord: An arm of the Sea flowing up from Kingsale, three Irish miles: we must
needs pass this Foord unto Enishanon, other way there is none.

Mounsieur Mack-Carty passed along the other side of the Foord upon the Strand,
in passing good order, as ever saw Rebels, since I came over, his Horse being
at least four or five hundred completely armed: his Foot two thousand, and
about six or seven hundred completely armed with Pike, half Pike, Musket, or
Calliver, (which makes me suspect something, seeing that a Rebel but lately
risen, and of no great note, this being the very first exployt that ever he
took in hand, as we hear of, should in so short a time be able to raise so
many men, and in that manner to furnish them) we expected not, till he should
bed us come over: but forthwith sent over our Cavalerie to charge him, and a
little to stay his haste, and to persuade him to take us along with him to
Enishannon: if we could not obtain so much as to be there before him: Sir
Simons two hundred Horse were as good, and as serviceably fitted, as ever were
horse, that went out of England and the Cavallieers that sat them, as
experienced Fire-men: Yet their marching so far in the water; and the enemy
standing on the dry strand, much broake their charge, and advantaged the
Enemies, who received their charge boldly, and answered it stoutly: at least
whether that they wanted powder, or (which I rather believe) their powder was
damp, being carried in bags by their side, (as their manner is) whether it was
one or the other, their pistols would no longer fire, with Mack-Cartie
perceiving, caused his Cavallerie to retire: and advances his Infanterie
against our Cavallerie: and not the worst in front you may be sure.

We victualled and mannerd the Castle with such provision and Ammunition as
we could well spare, until we shall hear farther from you; and on Monday
were back again at Kingsale.

Tuesday the eighteen we heard news that Bandon Bridge was suddenly surprised
by the Rebel Mac Con; and most fortunately relieved by Sir Richard Grenvill: a
very fine English Town walled in, belonging unto the Earl of Cork: the
manner thus: Sir Richard at his arrival to Cork, it being a thick and foggy
air, was something ill disposed: Captain Thomas Finch, Captain of the Fort,
persuaded him to take his Troop, and to scour the Country, passing as far
as Bandon, there to lodge a night or two, being a most sweet air, thereby not
only to recreate himself, but also to revive the drooping hearts of his dear
Countrymen, with the presence of so worthy a Commander: Sir Richard consented,
and the next morning being Monday, Jan. 11. with fourscore Horse, and only
thirty Musketeers, passed thither; when he came upon an hill, within a mile
of the Town, he heard their Drum beat, and saw their colors fly, the Town
standing in a bottom; likewise about some hundred shot play, wondering that
they played so fast: within half a mile we heard lamentations of women, and
crying out of children, we liked not that: Sir Richard caused his Trumpets to
sound, his Horse and Muskets to order, and thus they all crying courage
countrymen, a Grinfield, a Grinfield: we came to the gates, which by reason of
the great confusion in the Town, were not opened scarce within a quarter of an
hour.

Being entered, they found the Enemy to have entered in the Low Town thorough
the water, between two buts of wall; some forty were entered, and scirmishing
with the Towns men: the rest to the number of six hundred, were passing the
foord a maine; when they saw our trumpets and such a number of fresh horse in
that equipage, and the shot plainly increased, they in the passage retired
with all speed they could make, into the wood and bog, some Two miles above the
River, never staying for their fellows in the Town, who were all slain to
the number of forty five; nine Bandon men were either slain or dangerously
hurt: Thus was that pretty Town happily relieved, but all other news is not
of this nature, I wish it were.

Towns of greater importance are taken, that way we had sustained some harm,
had not Sir Simon so wisely considered the Rebels advantage, (having not only
the strand, but diverse high and broken sandy bancks behind him shocked with his
supplies) and caused his Infantery upon the falling back of his horse to come
up anckle deep in water in one whole body and to power in such a volley of
shot into the Rebels gross, that they dropped wonderfully, neither could their
shot at that distance reach our men, as appeared afterward, being most of them
Calivers: Sir Simon perceiving how the game played, would not suffer his men to
move any further, but to ply their shot at such distance, which he perceived
sufficiently anoyed their Enemies, and did them much harm; At the third
volley, the Enemies Infantery gave over and retired to the banckes upon their
horse, how much they retired as near as could be guessed, ours at distance
advanced, till at length, the Enemy gave the freedom of the strand: then after
one volley more, our horse now under the command of Sir Thomas Temple, having
recovered the strand also, as now our foot had already the bancks. At last,
having found where they got up two horse a breast, (the foot in the mean time
awing the Enemy, fell upon them in such a fierce manner), that no resistance in
a manner was made; there was dead upon the ground eight hundred horse and
foot, with Mack Cartie and his two Bastard brethren, whose heads were strait
way smitten off, and carried upon poles unto Enishannon.

Whither being come, the Town made, nor could make no resistance; The Castle
would not answer; whereupon Sir Simon with his five pieces battered the gate,
and wicket, entered by force, found thirty desperate Villains in it, hanged
some of them over the Castle wall, some in other parts of the Town.

FINIS.
