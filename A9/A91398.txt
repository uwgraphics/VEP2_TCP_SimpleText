^^^cious Assembly to consider of it, And I that have discharged my duty in
motioning, shall likewise join with you for the effecting of all things for the
good of this Kingdom.

Some Passages that happened the ninth of March, between the Kings Majesty, and
the Committee of both Houses, when the Declaration was delivered.
WHen His Majesty heard that part of the Declaration which mentioned Master
Iermyns Transportation, His Majesty interrupted the Earl of Holland in
reading, and said, That Is false. Which being afterward touched upon again, His
Majesty then said, It Is a lie. And when he was informed, it related not to the
Date, but the execution of the Warrant. His Majesty said, it might have been
better expressed then; and that it was a high thing to tax a King with breach
of Promise. As for this Declaration, His Majesty said, I could not have
believed the Parliament would have sent me such a one, if I had not seen it
brought by such persons of Honor. I am sorry for the Parliament, but glad I
have it: For by that, I doubt not to satisfy my People; though I am confident,
the greater part is so already.

Ye speak of all Councels, but I am confident the Parliament has had worse
Informations then I have had Councels: His Majesty asking what he had denied
the Parliament, The Earl of Holland instanced that of the Militia; His Majesty
replied, that no Bill: the Earl of Holland then said, it was a necessary
request at this time; and His Majesty also then said, he had not denied it.
