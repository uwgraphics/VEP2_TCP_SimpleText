THE STATE EMPERICK A New BALLAD.
To the Tune of, Which no body can deny.
[1]
FRom over the Seas not long since there came,
A Doctor of most Notorious Fame,
If you please, you may guess at his Unchristian name.
Which no body can deny.
[2]
This Doctor came hither to cure three Nations.
Who were so Silly as to be his Patients;
And first he Blooded 'em for the Fashions.
Which, etc.
[3]
The Medicine he brought was called a PLOT,
Which was Compounded of the Devil knows what:
When first he Arriv^d it was Piping-Hot.
Which, etc.
[4]
But if We may guess at the Damned Composition,
'Twas a mess of all sorts of English Sedition,
Made by a Presbyterian Physician.
Which, etc.
[5]
To make each Dose go down the safer,
What do*s me still This Learned Gaffer,
But Cover it or with a Papist's Water.
Which, etc
[6]
As soon as 'twas Swallowed, the Patient began,
To Stare and to Talk like a Lunatic Man,
Of Pistols and Daggers, to Kill and Trepan.
Which, etc.
[7]
To some 'twas Fmetick, to others Cathartick;
(I mean, to all those who of it did partake;)
In short, it made every Honest Man's heart-ake.
Which, etc.
[8]
To say truth we were all in a filthy Condition,
This voided a Libel, that Spewed a Petition,
For which we may thank in part our Physician.
Which, etc.
[9]
At last it made our Blood so ferment,
That a Rancorous Sore from Men's Body's was sent:
The Ulcer, I mean, of a strange Parliament.
Which, etc.
[10]
It Is Venom upon each Member was shed;
The Body it almost had overspread;
Nay, it had even like to have seiz*d on the Head.
Which, etc.
[11]
But one wiser then all* did gvi't such a Thump,
That ^t burst and went out, just next to the Rump,
Which made with Joy every Loyal Heart Jump.
Which, etc.
[12]
This Ulcer was full of Pistol and Sword,
With Blunderbuss and with your things made of Board;
Your Protestant Flayls to Fight for the Lord.
Which, etc.
[13]
O Doctor! I fear, you studied Art Magic,
To Compass your Ends, which still were so Tragic:
But now it is hoped that we may lead You-a-Jig.
Which, etc.
[14]
Or else I am sure, without being uncivil,
A Man my believe you deal with the Devil,
For no body else could have wrought us such Evil.
Which, etc.
[15]
Your Canting was Charm, Rebellion your Witch,
With these you gave the Poor Rabble the Itch,
When like Emp'rick on Stage you made 'em a Speech.
Which, etc.
[16]
You Are Jilted you see by Faction your Whore,
Your little Tap-Pug can help you no more:
Hell ow's Both a Spite, and will pay ye the score.
Which no body can deny.
