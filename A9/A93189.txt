A SHORT AND True Narrative of the departure from England, Sickness, and
Death, of that late worthy Knight, Sir PHILIP STAPLETON, Attested under the
hands of four of those Gentlemen that went with him. With a brief Character
of his Person, etc.
HAving met abroad with so much noise and to many malicious and false reports
touching the Conversation quality, life and death of that truly honorable
Gentleman, Sir Philip Stapleton, the glory and honor of his Country and
Family: I thought sir bring near him in most of his undertakings Military and
Civil, wherein both in public and pri^^^e his undaunted courage, and
accomplished endowments were sufficiently tried, to publish this short
narrative to the world, to silence those Calumnies and Aspersions daily spread
abroad against him, which though its much short of his true worth yet it is a
witnessing to the truth, and can be denied by none, that have either known of,
or been conversant with his person, parts, honor, Religion, or Family: and
first

For his Family, he is descended from royal stemms of honor and majesty.

For his Religion, he was a true and zealous Protestant, though not any way new
fangled, yet abundantly careful, and curious enough to discover the saving
truths in fundamentalls of Faith and knowledge, and living thereafter, ever
using all duties suitable to a sincerely hearted Christian in his Family, and
otherwise toward God and man, both in public and private to his dying day,
which he prosecuted with a modest zeal, and faithful constancy, Nor was he
easily engaged into any thing of Change, no not into that way he so much
sustred for (the Covenant and Church Government by Presbytery) though
afterward he looked upon it both in divine and prudent considerations, as the
way of God suiting most, and best with the union of the Nations, and in that
the welfare of both, And the next way under God (moderately advanced) to make
the three Kingdoms happy; and upon those very grounds, with most Christian and
indefatigable endeavors was a Cordial promoter of it. He was a religious
lover of both his Wives, and all his Children without partiality; breeding them
up in the fear of God, Giving life unto his admonitions and counsels, by his
holy, (...), and affectionate carriage and conversation toward them walking
with, and before them as a Husband and a Father, looking at, and depending upon
his and their Father in Heaven; And yet so as taking care of, and providing for
them competencies our of that little God had made him steward of. All which he
both faithfully and providently expressed in his life, and affectionately and
prudently disposed of at his death.

For his Honor, he had more then can well be allowed to any, but the best of
Englishmen, and of them, the most indeed, ^e was as much an Englishman, and as
truly noble in his heart, as England has ever bred, he abounded in courtesy to
all, even his enemies, that which was their shame to contrive or act against
him, he made it his honor to pass by. A most faithful friend, their
extremities were his opportunities in which he never thought he had done
enough; his compassions overflowed to the distressed, endeavoring upon all
occasions with all his interest, to give freedom and releif to the oppressed,
indeed he made this his business. For injuries received (though he was quick
enough in the first resentment of them) he heaped Coals upon their heads in
his returns of favor, he was indeed a friend to all that needed him, and an
enemy to none though sometimes he was unhappy in not being rightly understood
by them, which bred some mistakes, and those ill reports of him, but he well
knew that is part of the Good man's Portion in this world, hoe therefore walked
above them. He was a most faithful lover of his Country, the settlement of
the Peace, of which as he desired it above his temporal felicities, so he was
willing to spend himself, and to be spent for it. He was so far from making
these troubles a stirrup to his advantage, that (though others, too many, and
most of them pretend to piety and selfe-denyall, have reaped very many
thousands more then otherwise they ever were, or would have been masters of)
here refused Great things offered and voted to him, it is well known to diverse
of his nearest friends, he hated the thoughts of Glory or Ri^e this way, often
solemnly professing the peace of the Kingdom once settled he would retire and
spend his remaining days in blessing God for his mercies to this poor
Kingdom, and endeavor after a holy life, suitable to such an engagement; But
God would not have it so, but would rather honor him with a kind of martyrdom
for this Kingdom, who not sensible of his worth, knew not how to put a true
value upon such a Jewel, nor indeed was worthy of him: And therefore God
thought fit to call him to himself there to glorify him.

For his parts they were very eminent, he was quick of apprehension, sound of
judgment of clear and good clocution, and in things wherein the just Rights
of the King, the Privilege of the Parliament, and the safety of the Kingdom
(against what power soever) was concerned, or the re^ig'^ of any distressed
required it, he ever spoke freely, and with great abilities by which he not
only gained much interest in the house and abroad but also contracted upon
himself much envy from others as the great obstructer of their designs, he
very well fore-knowing and constantly in public and private asserting that the
Change of this Government (so much aimed at by some though otherwise pretended
is contrary to the well being at least of this Nation and to the union with our
brethren of Scotland and will be when ever attempted destructive to the safety
of both; And he would often say, that though he and others* possibly through
the power some had might be persecuted to banishment or death, and that it
might be (...) on against (...) under (...) of justice and righteousness in
those that did it, suggesting dangerous designs to be underhand contrived by
himself and others, contrary to the interest of this Kingdom, and the trust
put upon him and them in Parliament, which he abhorred and of which he ever
solemnly took God to witness he was innocent of, and those other of those things
of which they were falsely accused. And though he did of late foresee it would
be done, though by never so unjust and unwarrantable wales, the principle those
people ground their actions upon, being (guided by light and conscience, as
they falsely pretend) to destroy all men of parts or interest that oppose their
way, it may be blindly supposing they do God good service in it. Yet when God
had suffered them to go so far he was confident it would return upon them
in the latter end, to their own shame and ruin. And for him and the rest,
though they perished under it yet their overthrow would become their crown,
and therefore he submitted it to God acquiessing in his will.

For his person, he was of a thin body, and weak constitution but full of
spirit, which was too soon spent (if God had seen it good) with the manifold
endeavors and excessive pains he day and night undervvent for the service of
this poor Kingdom: And though he found his body not able to endure much
hardship, yet when the Kingdom had need of it, and God called him to it, he
exposed himself to the greatest hazards in the war, daring as much, and
going as far in that service, as any mortal ever did, witness those eminent
engagements of his in the two great Battles of Keinton and Newberry, in which
he was in a very high degree isntrumental to the gaining of the day in both.
And being afterward with that most famous, and ever to be honored the Lord
General, the Earl of Essex and others, by the selfe-denying vote (which how,
and to what ends made use of by some, the world well knows, and God will
judge) called off, he, and they all laid down his Arms without any dispute,
which will one day rise up in judgment against the men (of this world) of our
days pretend what they will, who as he frequently said persecuted him for his
judgment and conscience declared where it was his duty to speak both (though
they pretend it a Liberty of Conscience to speak and act what and where they
ought not) he valued himself so little in comparison to his service to this
Kingdom, that he would willingly have suffered to Assasination, rather then
have declined his ^^^^ng in Parliament: but finding upon serious debate, that
at present to give way to the furious multitude, madded with a pretense of
zeal to Justice and Righteousness it probably might be of better service to
the Kingdom to withdraw, did it. And though afterward at the Call of the
House, sat again (which he and the rest might have done at their pleasure)
his reasons at are well known to some, were so public, that for this alone he
deserves the highest honor: thus to hazard himself again upon this ground
that if it were possible by improvement of Counsels and means, the utter
violation of the Parliament^ and the plunder, and destruction of the City, who
had been so much a^^istant to the preservation of this Parliament and Kingdom
so much threatened might be prevented. But when another way was taken which
possibly he thought not honorable then again upon the aforesaid Grounds, by
the leave and pass of the House formerly ordered ^otally withdrew and
travailed (as it unhappily proved to England) having at that time a Flux upon
him with his journey and voyage by Land and Sea increased etc.

SIR.
OBeying that necessity that enforced us out of England* Four of us vi^. Sir
William Waller, Sir William Lewis* Sir Philip Stapleton (though then Feverish
with a Flux that had followed him some days before) with Col. Long began our
Journey on Saturday the 14th of his instant toward whole Haven in ^ssex, where
we were by eight the next morning to meet Sir John Clo^worthy, who was to come
thither by water; In which journey out first inconvenience was. A report we met
at Aveley, 16. miles from London, that a party of Sir Thomas Fairfax his Horse,
with some of those Dragoones, that lately had taken Til^ury Fort: were
quartered in our way, to the Haven abovementioned, which made us leave the
road, not willing to trust to the security our Passes should have given us,
against the insolences that the Troupers might have been over-apt unto. And
that from our experience of their way, in avowing their Actions without orders
from their Officers, which cast us on such ill Lodgings that night, that few of
our Company put off their clothes, whereby Sir Philip Stapletons distempers
were much increased, but yet his willingness to go on his journey was such,
that we all went on board a Pinke that was to carry us on Sunday about one in
the afternoon, where the first nerves that saluted us, was that some Watermen
on shore, had threatened the Master of the Vessel, that he would run
himself into a great danger by carrying of us over, which made him leave his
Vessel, and our Voyage to the care of his servant, though half his wages were
paid before our coming out of London, and a Gentleman that acc^mpanied Sir
Philip Stapleton to the water side, hearing the Watermen therein some
unnecessary discourse concerning our Journey knocks one of them over the pace,
which wrought so with them, that they became so diligent in pressing the Master
of the Backs danger upon him, that the fellow (having had neither the wit, nor
the honesty to ask us for the sight of our Passes, became so frighted
therewith that he hastened along the Coast, to stop us; And we being under
sail, came by Gods blessing, though the wind was high and we once in great
danger of being cast away, (some three Vessels having by that storm perished
near Callice,) as far as Margetts, and Anchored against that place for that
night, which was a very blustering one, without any accommodation for any of us
wherewith we were the more afflicted from Sir Philip Stapletons sufferings, by
reason of his want of health; And he sing Sail the next morning (though at our
coming out we resolved for Plushing) yet we determined for Callice the cu^^
being shorter, and the wind blowing fairer thither, having had enough of the
Sea in our small Bark, to give us cause to wish our selves ashore; And in our
passage we came by some of the Parliament Ships, under the Command of the
Vice Admiral, riding at the Downs; and sailing within call of the Nicodemus
Frigott we were questioned whence we came and whither we were bound; to which
having answered from London, and for Callice, we passed on, having in view of
the Fleet taken up a Pilot of Sandwich to assist the manning of our Bark,
finding our selves much inconvenienced for want of the Masters help therein:
and so holding on with a fair wind, had recovered near Callice; the
aforementioned fright had so wrought on the Master of the Bark, that
recovering Margetts he dispersed a report there, that we had stolen away without
Passes, conveyed with us 16000 pounds in Treasure, and taken away his Bark
without his consent: Whereupon the Drums were beaten up there, and a Boat
manned out after us, with some forty in Arms, who not able to reach us, came
with that false alarm to the Captain of the Nicodemus Frigott
abovementioned; and he thereupon slipped his Anchors, and being a swift sayler
overtooke us about noone within some two leagues of Callice, where shooting a
warning-Peece at us, some of his men came aboard us, and some of us went aboard
to him, and he requiring us to return to the Vice Admiral, we tackt about,
and the wind being contrary, it was near ten at night e're we could recover
into his Ship, who seeing our Passes, was troubled that we were stopped in our
journey, but upon the report so generally divulged of the great Treasure we had
with us, would not dismiss us the next morning without a Council of War, who
advised the search of our Portmantles, and our servants to their very pockets,
for his justification and ours, and that in the presence of some of them, that
had published those false rumors, after which finding with us but some few
changes of Linen and clothes; on Tuesday morning about ten of the clock,
having bin civilly treated we farwel'd him, and went on our journey for
Callice, (Sir Philip Stapleton having gotten some rest, in one of his Cabbins,
and some ease from those things which had been administered him by his
Surgeon) where we arrived about five in the evening, and hoped that a few
days rest there, would have recovered Sir Philip Stapleton so, as that he
would have been enabled to have gone on our intended journey through Flanders
for Holland; but his Flux continuing with him on Tuesday night together with
his Fever, and his stomach failing him, though neither he nor we had any mind
to the French Physicians, yet on Wednesday he inclined to consult with the
only one that was there, who coming to him, and discoursing his then
condition, without mentioning his being in any danger, resolved that he should
about eight that night, have a Glyster, the which he took accordingly, and
that he should have a vein opened the next morning his Glister not working
well with him and his Fever continuing and he having had no rest that night,
sent to desire to speak with some of us, as soon as we could be ready, coming
to him, he acquainted us therewith, and that he had a swelling risen upon his
thigh, somewhat below his groyne, the painfulnesse whereof was such, that it
did not only hinder his sleep, but his lying at any ease; At the hearing
whereof, having been informed, that the sickness was in the Town, and that
the Inhabitants were not only fearful thereof, but very inhumane to any that
were visited therewith, removing of them out of the Town, what ever their
condition was, to a place without the Walls where there were Cabbins provided
for them; some of us by his desire, took the freedom to lay hands upon the
place, he complained of, both for our own satisfaction, and to be enabled to
give the Physician a clear account thereof, he enforming us, that he conceived
it arose from the weight of his Watch lying thereon, and that he had formerly
been once or twice troubled in the like sort; We apprehending the great danger
it might have been to him, to have a vein opened, in case God had visited him
with the sickness, did thereupon with his approbation, resolve to acquaint the
Physician with that swelling, who there with his Apothecary, and Chirurgian
view it, and resolved from the form thereof, and the place it was in, that it
could be no Plague; and so proceeded to the opening of his vein, and took
from him some eight ounces of blood, which was so extremely corrupted, that it
turned to a yellowish kind of water before it could be brought from the bed
where he lay to his Chamber window after his vein was bound up again, he told
us, that he found his head well, and his heart whole, and that the Chirurgian
having laid a Plaster upon his swelling he found the pain thereof also to
abate, but yet his reaver continued without allowing him to take any rest, and
he began to draw his breath stiorter, whereat we were so troubled, that we
again sent for the Doctor to him, who came to us about two in the afternoon,
but upon some discourse that had passed between him and the Surgeon he was
so fully resolved that his sickness was the Plague, that we could not
persuade his going up to him; You cannot but easily guess how we were
therewith astonished, knowing that after his blood-letting, if it were the
Plague, that there was no hope of his life, and whilst we were in discourse
with him and the Surgeon of what had been done, and what was now to be done
for him; It pleased God to call for him to a better place, and the end of his
misery, gave a beginning not only to our forrowes for him, but to an unheard
of cruelty exercised upon us in the house (being the three silver Lions) where
we were, where the people of the house falling into a present outcry, clap to
their gates, and resolved to keep us Prisoners in the house, till we should
give them satisfaction for the damage they suggested, they should receive by
his death there, and with impudency demanded from us two hundred and fifty
pounds, alleging that it was fit his Estate should yield them a further
recompense, it was there neither time, nor place, to offer or expect reason,
and we were thereupon necessitated, to ply our selves by the mediation of an
English Gentleman living in the Town, to the Magistracy there, as well Civil
as Martial, and through his intercourse with them, concluded to give the
Master of the house toward his satisfaction for the damage he might receive,
fourscore pounds sterling, ten pounds to the Doctor, twelve pounds to the
Surgeon, and two pounds ten shillings to the Apothecary, being in total one
hundred four pounds ten shillings, Toward the which we received from his
servant Thomas Gage, of his Money, the sum of seventy three pounds ten
shillings, leaving the rest of his Money with him for his transport, and his
Masters goods for England, and for his Masters Interment, the which he being a
Protestant and dying as they supposed of the Sickness, was to be in their
ordinary and rough way.

This thus concluded, discharging all their other demands, we had the gates of
the house opened unto us, and were permitted to go aboard a Bark we hired
there, at an extraordinary rate for Flushing; being from their cruelty,
enforced to be the Porters of our own baggage to the water side, and lying
there at Anchor that night, under the extremities incident to so poor a
conveyance, when we were weighing Anchor about eleven of the clock, with the
morning Tide, the Town Searchers boarded us, and searched our Persons, our
Servants, our Males, and every thing therein* in the expectation to have found
great Treasure, report having come to Callice before our arrival, that we had
brought away with us, one hundred thousand pounds in Gold, which had raised
their hopes to have had a great Booty of us, and made them the willinger to
believe, that report of the Plague; The Searchers being no way curious in
handling either of us, or any thing that did belong to us, in pursuit of their
prey, but ^^^ding that we had been stripped at our Inn, to a ^can^ling only,
fit for our journey, they f^rw^ld us, and we them and that their so cruel a
place; And being not able to reach Flushing that night passing in our way the
next morning over against Bla^ckborough under the care as we thought of a
l^^owing Flemish Pilote we struck on the sands near twenty times, when in all
likelihood we must have perished, had not God continued his mercy to us in the
mildnes of the weather so as to give us leave to tack about, and to recover
more ware^, after which we got to Flushing upon Saturday, where we continued
the Sabbath day, and went thence on Monday to Trov^^^^, and thence on Tuesday
morning, so as we got hither on Wednesday at noone, being the first place that
allowed us opportunity of sending unto you this sad story, as it relates to our
deceased Friend; We cannot be insensible of the loss, his Lady, his Children,
his Friend, the Kingdom itself, has had in so gallant a Gentleman, we need
make you no profession (we are confident,) that we were not wanting to him in
the duties of friendship, not shall not be (if ever we may express i^ (to any
that have relation to him, we know your respect such toward him and his; That
you will take some friend with you, to Communicate this sad piece to his Lady,
who has our prayers that God may assist her to undergo this great affliction,
and that he may be a Father to his Fatherless Children, we desire to hear
from you of the receipt hereof; Wishing your happiness, and that we might
hear that the Distempers in England were all well composed by a happy Peace,
we remain,

Rotterdam, 27 August, 1647.
A farther relation concerning some other passages of his sickness, Death and
Burial.
HE landed at Callice on Tuesday Aug 17 about 6 aclock at night, and presently
took his bed, being very sick, and continued till Thursday about two aclock in
the afternoon; the Gentlemen came to him at times til 11. that morning; In this
time his man Thomas Gage did often raise him up in his bed, when he was in much
pain, and held him up with Pillowes behind. On Wednesday he sat up three
hours together in the afternoon, about two hours before his departure, he
willed his man to let him lie along in his Bed, then being so laid, he lift up
his hand and eyes to heaven; His man perceiving that, he asked him if he were
in pain; he answered, in no pain at all; He asked him again, whether he
thought he should die, and he answered, yes, and willed his man to commend him
to his Wife, and not to forget his Children; After this he betook himself to
prayer for an hour and a half, praying for his enemies, and desiring God to
receive his soul, and then quietly departed without groan or gasp. About ten
aclock at night there came one and wraped him in a sheet, and put him in a
Coffin, and with another sheet over the Coffin; He was carried to the place
where the Protestants of that City use to bury their dead, and there was
buried. The Inhabitants of the place say, that there was once a Church there,
but burnt down by the Spaniards; It being a waste place, the Protestants
purchased it for their burying place. It is compassed about with a broad Ditch
or Moate, only at the entrance there are two sides of Brick, and a large Gate
betwixt them, which is kept shut, at burial times.
