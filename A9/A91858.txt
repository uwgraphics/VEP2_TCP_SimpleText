THEOLOGY, (or the Doctrine of Divinity, thus described) may, for the clearer
understanding of it, be considered according to all the four causes of it,
viz. The I. Efficient Cause, or first Principle of this Doctrine of Theology,
whereupon it is firmly grounded, wherein it is clearly revealed, and whereby it
is fully proved, is the divine revelation of it in the 1. Holy Scripture.
II. Formal Cause of this Doctrine of THEOLOGY, is either 1. Inward, viz.
That sweet harmony betwixt the sense of this Doctrine, and the true sense of
Scripture, and so consequently, the mind and meaning of God himself. 2.
Outward, viz. The method or disposition of this system or body of divine
Doctrine, which may be variously drawn up, according to the various rules of
Art and Method: Provided always, that the order of divine dispensations,
clearly observed in Scriptures, be not thereby inverted or obscured.
III. Material cause, comprising all the subject matters, wherein our
religious living to God consists: which are handled in Divinity; and may be
reduced to two heads (whence the two parts of Divinity result) viz. 1. Matters
to be known and believed concerning God: and they respect Gods 1. Nature,
wherein are considerable 1. What God is in himself: So he may be considered 1.
Essentially, as One in Essence 2. God. 3. Unity of Essence.
2. Personally, as Three in Subsistence 4. Trinity of persons.

2. Who, or what manner of God he is; both according to the divine 1. Titles,
by which he is named, viz. the 5. Names of God.
2. Properties, which are to him attributed, viz. the divine 6. Attributes 1.
Essential. 2. Personal.



2. Works, which are either 1. Internal, eternal and immanent in GOD
himself, viz. His Decree it self. 7. Works of God in general. 8. Decree.
2. External, temporal, and transient from God to the creature, viz. his
actual excution of his Decree, which he does two ways, by 1. Original
production of all things out of nothing, exceeding good: which may be
considered 1. More generally, in reference to the whole world; by 9. Creation.
2. More specially, in references to the principal parts of the world,
intellectual creatures in 1. Heaven 10. Angels. 1. State of Creation.

2. Earth 11. Men.


2. Actual provision for all things created, by his actual providence, both
in his 1. Dispensations natural, for the general good of all the creatures
natural beings and well beings: and this by his 12. Providence 1. General. 2.
Particular.

2. Dispensations supernatural, for the special good of the intellectual
creatures in their supernatural beings and well beings, partly by his 1.
Confirmation of the elect Angels, that kept their first estate, which the
reprobate Angels left 13. Confirmation of Angels. II. State of Corruption.

2. Restoration of man, that lost his first estate: herein are comprised the
1. Malady, into which man was plunged, and from whence he was to be restored,
viz. his first apostacy from God by his 14. Fall into 1. Sin. 2. Misery. III.
State of Restitution.


2. Remedy, whereby man was restored from this malady, viz. REDEMPTION by Jesus
Christ. In this Redemption are to be observed three things, viz. the 1.
Publication or Revelation of it to mankind, in the glad tidings of the 15.
Gospel.
2. Operation or Preparation of it for man: herein consider 1. The Person that
wrought man's redemption, viz. only that Immanuel, GOD-MAN 16. Redemption. 17.
JESUS CHRIST.
2. The Office laid upon him, whereby he accomplished this work 18. Office of
Christ.
3. The States wherein he discharged this office, viz. His 19. State of 1.
Humiliation. 2. Exaltation.


3. Application of it unto man. This application may be considered 1.
Absolutely in it self; and so it contains Gods 1. Salvificall benefits,
themselves, which in Christ are applied by several steps and degrees;
translating man from misery to mercy, from sin to grace, from grace to glory:
and this by advancing man to 1. Union to Christ, separating man unto himself
from the common corrupt mass of mankind, by 20. Vocation effectual.
2. Communion with Christ, 1. In his spotless Righteousness, by 21. Communion
with God in Christ. 22. Justification actual.
2. In his matchless Sonship, by 23. Adoption.
3. In his true Holiness, by 24. Sanctification real. IV. State of Perfection.

4. In his endless Happiness, by 25. Glorification eternal.
This Glory is communicated 1. Particularly and incompletely to every elect
soul only at his particular 26. Death.
2. Generally and completely to both souls and bodies of all the elect at the
general 27. End of the world.



2. Isntrumental means, whereby these saving benefits are effectually
applied, viz. the outward Ordinances of God: which are either 1. Ordinary used
upon all occasions: and these are either 1. Primary Ordinances, made more
principally prevalent for the breeding and nourishing union and communion with
Christ; These are to be considered 1. Essentially, according to their substance
and peculiar operation, both to our 1. Confederation with GOD in Christ, as the
dispensation and preaching of the 28. Word. 29. Promises. 30. Covenant of Grace.
2. Confirmation in that confederation, as the administration of the seals of
the Covenant, viz. 31. The Sacraments.

2. Accidentally, according to their circumstance and manner of administration
in the times before and under the Old and New Testaments 32. Manner of
administration of the Covenant and Sacraments before and under the old and New
Testaments.

2. Secondary Ordinances, subservient unto the former, in promoting the birth
and growth of grace in the soul, viz. 33. Reading, or hearing the word read.
34. Catechizing. 35. Religious conference. 36. Meditation. 37. Prayer. 38.
Singing of Psalms. 39. Communion of Saints.

2. Extraordinary, used only upon special and extraordinary occasions, for the
advancement and improvement of our interests in Christ: and these are religious

Political and Civil matters. Thus the Jews Commonwealth was regulated by
the 45. Law. 46. Judicial Law.
2. Ecclesiastical and Religious matters, which are either 1. Typical,
peculiar to certain times and persons only. Thus the Jewish Church, during the

Gentiles, before and under both the Old and New Testaments, are under the 48.
Moral Law.


2. The nature of this Obedience, which is considered 1. More generally, here
are considerable the general nature of 49. Obedience and 50. Good works.
2. More specially, and so it comprehends 1. The inward Principle of Obedience
whence all obedientiall Acts do flow, viz. the infused Habit or Habits of true
51. Virtue 1. Theological. 2. Philadelphicall. I. Table.


2. The inward and outward acts or exercise of Obedience, flowing from this
Principle of virtue, to be expressed 1. Toward God, in an holy worship of him,
which is styled RELIGION and Piety. This Piety is exercised 1. In the having
and worshipping of the true God, and him alone, for our God in Christ; which is
the proper scope of the 52. Religion, Piety. 53. I. Commandment.
2. In the true worship of this true God. And herein are contained 1. The true
and pure worship it self, which is to be performed to this one only true God,
merely according to his own will: as is prescribed in the 54. II. Commandment.
2. The Adjuncts of this worship, viz. 1. The true manner How this true God
will always be worshipped by us, viz. so Reverendly, Holily, Sincerely, etc.
as may be most honorable to his great and holy Name, as is required in the 55.
III. Commandment.
2. The special Time When God will be more solemnly and publicly worshipped,
viz. on his Day of Sabbath, oath under the Old and New Testament, which Sabbath
is sanctified by him authoritatively, and is to be sanctified by us
obedientially, as is enjoined in the 56. IV. Commandment. II. Table.




2. Toward Man, in righteousness, brotherly love and sobriety, which are to be
performed 1. In deed, word and thought toward our neighbor, considered either
1. Relatively, in reference to that relation, order or degree of his condition,

according to the 57. Righteousness, Brotherly love, Sobriety. 58. V.

2. His Goods and Possessions, by acts of Justice commutative, prescribed in
the 61. VIII. Commandment.
3. His good name, by acts of truth and veracity, commanded in the 62. IX.
Commandment.



2. In the very first motions of the heart (even those motions that go before a
complete and deliberate assent) toward our neighbor, in reference to all and
every one of the foregoing Commandments of the second Table. The well
ordering of which motions is charged upon us in the 63. X. Commandment.






IV. Final cause, or the end whereunto our religious living unto God tends, is
either 1. Subordinate, and less Principal, respecting man, viz. The present
and future 64. Happiness of Man.
2. Ultimate, and most principal, respecting God himself, viz. The present
and eternal 65. Glory of God.
