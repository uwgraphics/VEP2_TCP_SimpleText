A Warning for all Worldlings to learn to Dye.
The tune^s, The Ladies Fall.



GOod people all repent with speed*
high time it is to pray,
Tempt not the just and righteous God
with vain and long delay:
And while it is the day indeed,
for mercy call and cry,
O would that men would bear in mind,
that one day they must dye.
Thy self in thy security,
why do thou flatter so?
Deferring thy repenting days,
till age does bring thee low;
And further, till thy Sickest hour
that e're thou have to lie,
O would that men, etc.
O dust and ashes, do thou think
the Glorious God of might,
will take in worth these wicked things
and wait on thy delight?
O mark how sore and suddenly,
his Wrath on him will lie;
O would that men, etc.
For what is he upon the earth,
that can himself secure,
Or say that for an hours space
my life it can endure:
No man on earth can warrant life,
the twinkling of an eye,
O would that men, etc.
And after death thy self assure,
repentance comes too late,
Not all the wealth within the world,
that can thy pains abate;
For as a tree does take his fall,
even so the same does lie:
Therefore in chiefest of thy health,
prepare thy self to dye.
And se^st not thou in Sickness often,
men's memories decay,
Who many times do Rove and Rage,
when they have need to pray,
Whose hearts are ^ent to ^an and curse,
till death does close their eye:
Therefore, etc.
The second Part to the same Tune:
ANd if thou have thy memory
and understanding right,
And of thy speech the perfect use,
and brightness of thy sight:
Yet may the Lord withold his grace
and take thy Faith from thee,
That to repent thy folly past,
thou shall not able be.
But yet admit, our gracious God,
in mercy for to deal,
That in thy Sickness he ^ouch-safe,
his mercy to reveal;
Yet thou shall have a thousand griefs,
to wring thy mind awry;
Therefore, etc.
For thou shall have thy body then
disquieted with pain,
Thy head and heart will vexed be,
and so will every vain:
The pangs of death will fear thee sore
whose force thou can n of fly;
Therefore, etc.
The love of life will tempt thee much
whose favor was so sweet,
And thou will muse of many things
that for thy health is meet:
To think thou must forgo thy Goods
will nip thy heart full nigh:
Therefore, etc.
To see thy Friends and Neighbors all
thy dying hour abide:
To see thy Wife and Children small
cry out on every side;
To think thou must for go them all
will nip thy heart full nigh;
Therefore, etc.
Besides, to think upon thy Sins,
will much molest thy mind,
The fresh remembrance of the same
thou shall most bitter find;
Despair and dread will drown thy heart,
for living so awry:
Therefore, etc.
And thy accusing conscience then
will witness to thy woe,
How wickedly upon the earth
thou did thy days bestow:
And this within thy pensive breast
most grievously will lie:
Therefore, etc.
Then will the Devil most busy be
Gods Justice to declare,
And of his mercy he will still
procure thee to despair:
Persuading thee thy grievous Sins
do for Hell ever cry:
Therefore, etc.
Here may thou see, (oh, wretched man)
how hard a time thou ha^t
Prepared to repent thy Sins,
at this thy latter cast;
Therefore put not repentance back
do not Gods Grace deny;
But in the chiefest of ^hy health, etc.
Let every one pray that the Lord
may bless our King and Queen,
And grant that they in all their days
may joyfully be seen:
And after death that they may live
in ^oy eternally.
Then let all people say, Amen,
And so Amen, say I.
