MR. THOMAS PVRY Alderman of Gloucester his SPEECH, Upon that Clause of the
Bill against EPISCOPACY; the which concerns DEANES, and DEANES and CHAPTERS at
a Committee of the whole House.
Mr. HIDE,
I Rise not up to Answer the Arguments of the Learned Gentleman of the long
robe that spoke last, the which were to prove some Incoherence of the Preamble
with the body of the Bill concerning the abolishing of Deanes and Chapters in
respect of their government in the Church of England, who have none at all, as
has been argued, but there are some Reasons stick with me, whereby I do
conceive, that the Deanes and Chapters have been, and are part of the
Government of the Church of England, and that the preamble, and body of this
Bill, therein may very well stand together; for if you take the Deanes and
Chapters in their Original, who (as it was said by a learned Sergeant over
against me) were first founded in superstition alike to your Regular and
Secular Monks; or if you consider them as in their prime institution to be
Consilium Epis. to assist Bishops in their Government and Discipline; or if you
look upon those Deanes and Chapters of the last Foundation by Henry the eight:
yet certainly they are in all these capacities a part of the government of the
Church of England; and as well the Rural, as the Cathedral Deanes are numbered
by our own Writers among Church Governors, and they are in and among
themselves a part of the Church Government, and by the Book of Reformation of
Ecclesiastical Laws they are to govern themselves according to their
Statutes of Foundation, and to keep them pure and entire, so far as they are
not repugnant to the Word of God, and our Constitutions of Religion. And for
the better Satisfaction of this Committee and my self, here is a Copy of the
Statutes Grant, and Foundation of the Deane and Chapter of the city of
Gloucester, I have read them over, and do find, first the end wherefore the
Lands and Possessions were granted unto them. Secondly, the manner and form of
Gevernment of themselves. And lastly, their several Oaths to keep all the
Statutes prescribed unto them: And because of my weak memory, please you to
give me leave to read the words in the Kings Grant, Englished thus;

We have erected and constituted Cathedralls and Colleges in the place of
Monasteries, to the end, that where Ignorance, and Superstition did reign
there; the sinceere Worship of God should flourish, and the holy Gospel of
Christ Jesus should be daily and purely Preached. And further, that the
increase of the Christian Faith and Piety, the instruction of youth in good
learning, and the sustentation of the poor should be for ever there kept,
maintained and continued; and the said Deane, Prebends, Cannons, and all other
persons belonging to the said Cathedralls and Colleges, are to be governed and
ruled according to the Statutes prescribed unto them.

Sir, the Statutes are many, I will in brief tell you the substance of some
few af them. The said Deane, Prebends, and Canons, are always to reside and
dwell in the houses of the said Cathedrialls, and there to keep a Family, good
hospitality, to feed the poor, and to distribute Alms unto the needy, to be
careful to Preach the Word of God, In season, and out of season, and to sow
the seed of the Word of God abroad but especially in the said Cathedral
Church, and to have youth profitable taught there. And to the end that they may
all serve God, as well at meals as in the Church, they are to have a common
Table in the common Hall of the said Cathedral, where the said Cannons
Scholars, Quiresters, and Underofficers, are appointed to eat together, and
the said Deane and Chapter, are to give yearly twenty pound to the poor,
beside their own poor Almsmen, and twenty pound more yearly toward the
repairing of Bridges and Highways thereabouts.

Sir, for the performance of the said Statutes and premises. The said Deane,
Prebends Canons and Ministers of the said Cathedral do, or ought respectively
to take an Oath; and thereby in express words do call God to witness, and do
swear upon the holy Evangelists, to rule, govern and behave themselves well
and faithfully in the said Church, according to the Will and Statutes of the
Founder, and every one of them do swear, that he will to his utmost power
well and faithfully keep all and singular the said Ordinances and Statutes, as
much as concerns himself, and will procure all others as much as concerns
them to keep the same inviolablely, So help him God, and these holy Gospels
of God.

Mr. HIDE, You see wherefore the Lands were granted unto Deanes and Chapters,
what their Statutes are, and their Oaths to keep them: It might be thought
that these men do know no way, another, or nearer way to heaven than they
teach us; or otherwise that they would not sit in the seat of Perjury, as it
may steme they do, without remorse of conscience: For it is notoriously known
to the city of Gloucester and country there abouts, That not one of the said
Statutes before mentioned, are, or ever were, during my remembrance, kept, or
the matters contained in any of them performed by any of the Deanes or Prebends
of the said Cathedral; They come indeed once a year to receive the Rents and
Profits of the said Lands, but do not destribute unto the poor and needy
their portion, neglecting altogether the mending of the Highwayes and Bridges,
and do not keep any common Table at all: and in stead of Preaching the Word
of God themselves, In season, and out of season, they are, and have been the
chief instruments to hinder the same in others. Infinite are the Pressure that
many Cities near unto Deanes and Chapters, have endured by them, and their
procurement. And whereas it was objected by another learned Gentleman of the
long robe, That the Deanes and Chapters are a body corporate, and that they
have as much right unto their Lay possessions as any other body politic, or
any City or Town Corporate; I am of his opinion, for such Lands and
Possessions (if they have any) which they bought themselves in right of their
corporation, or for such Lands as were given them for their own use, and I am
well contented that such Lands should be left unto them; but their case is
far different in my opinion; for I have showed you before, to what godly,
pious, and charitable uses the said Lands and possessions were granted unto
them: And suitable thereunto you may call to mind the Londoners Case about
Londonderry in the Starrechamber, where they were fined 70000. pound to his
Majesty, and the same afterward estrated into his Majesty's Exchequer. But
upon the Writ of Extent issuing out thereupon, his Majesty, as I have heard,
received no benefit of any such Lands, whereof the Corporation was seized for
the maintenance of any Hospitalls, Bridges, or other charitable uses, or ought
to have done, as I conceive. Seeing therefore the said Deanes and Chapters are
but Trustees, and the profits of the said Lands, so ill employed by them,
contrary to the trust reposed in them; I am clear of opinion, that by a
Legislative power in Parliament, it is fit to take them away, and to put them
into the hands of Feoffees to be disposed of to such pious, riligious, and
charitable uses, as they were first intended: But it was said by a worthy
Knight, That he should be unwilling to take away their Lands and Possessions,
until he first knew how they should be disposed of, and how the persons, who
were many thousands in this Kingdom (as he said) that would want bread, should
be provided for. Certainly Mr. Hide (although that is not the work at this
time) yet I account it no difficulty to satisfy that worthy Knight; for I
find upon the survay of the Lands of the said Deanery of Gloucester, that it
has above twelve Rectoryes of good value, and about thirty Vicaredges,
Pentions, and Portions of Tithes, which being at the first, Deo consecraota,
most fit they should be still employed for the maintenance of the Gospel; and
therefore if those Deanes and Prebends being but seven in all to be now taken
away, will be Preaching Ministers, there is, I hope, sufficient maintenance for
so many of them as have not too much, besides and yet to reserve as large a
Salary as now they have for so many singing men there in holy Orders that
cannot Preach. And then there are left to be provided for, but the Organist,
eight Singing boys, two Schoolmasters, four poor Almesmen, and some
Underofficers, whose yearly wages, comes unto about one hundred pound per
annum; and the said Deane and Chapter have almost the third part of the houses
of the City of Gloucester the old rent of them being yearly about 175. pound,
which will well defray that charge with a sufficient Surplusage for repairing
the highwayes, Bridges; and twenty pound yearly to the poor, as aforesaid.

But over and besides, the said yearly revenewes before mentioned, the said
Deane and Chapter of Gloucester, although but of the last Foundation, and one
of the least revenewes in this Kingdom, yet they have eighteen goodly
Manors, and also diverse other Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, besides the
Manors houses, and premises, the old rent of Assize of one of the said Manors
being 80. pound per annum; out of which Manors and Lands, the said Cathedral
being to be made a Perochicall Church 200. pound per annum, or more may be
allowed for a learned Preaching Minister there, and a hundred pound a year
apeice, for two such others to assist him, with in few years, one of the said
Manors will discharge, and also smfficiently repair the said Cathedral
Church; and then the rest of the said Manors and Lands may be employed to
other godly, pious, or charitable uses, as the Wisdom of the King and
Parliament shall think fit, and suitable to this, but in a more ample
proportion of maintenance, will be the allowances of all other Deaneryes in
England.

Again, this I conceive will answer another Objection raised by a worthy
Knight at the Bar touching the poverty of the Clergy of England, if this Bill
should take effect, surely my opinion is quite contrary; and to that purpose, I
call to mind the saying of a learned Divine, Chaplain to a Noble man, upon
some conference with him of our wished desire to remove scanlous Ministers, and
to reduce the Impropriations of Bishops, and Deanes and Chapters to a Preaching
Ministry, if these things, said he, take effect, the Universities, will not be
able to supply the Churches: And surely Sir, if these things take effect, I am
confident we shall be so far from having a poor beggarly Clergy, as that no
Kingdom in the Christian world will have a more rich, and flourishing Clergy,
both for Nurseries, and encouragements of Learning: and for their maintenance
in more plentiful manner than it is at this present. Please you therefore to
put the Question, I am ready to give my aid thereunto.

FINIS.
