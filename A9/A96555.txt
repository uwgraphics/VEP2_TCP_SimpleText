His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
WHEN I Consider how far the Year is advanced, what Preparations our Enemies
make to be Early in the Field, and how necessary it is, that We should be Ready
to Meet them, both by Sea and Land, I must earnestly Recommend to you the
Dispatch of those Important Affairs, which you have under your Deliberation.

I am very sensible of the good Affection, which you have shown in this, as
well as former Sessions, by Enabling Me to Carry on the War We are Engaged in,
for Our Common Safety. There is nothing I have so much at My Heart; as the Ease
and Happiness of My People; and it is with great Reluctance that I am forced to
Ask such large Supplies; But since Our present Circumstances make this
unavoidable, It shall be My Endeavor, That the Sums which are Given, shall be
laid out in the best manner, to the Uses for which they are designed.

Gentlemen of the House of Commons,
I take this Occasion to Mention to you the Debt for the Transport-Ships, which
were used in the Reducing of Ireland. It grieves Me exceedingly to see such a
Number of Persons, who came so freely in for so good a Service, brought to the
last Extremities for want of what is Due to them. It is not possible for Me to
Discharge this Debt, without your Help; And as I doubt not but you have a Just
Commiseration of their Case so I hope you will Find out some Way for their
Relief.

FINIS.
