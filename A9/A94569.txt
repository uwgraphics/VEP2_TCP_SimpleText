To the PARLIAMENT of the Commonwealth of ENGLAND.
THe assurance I have, that all your Honors cares and labors have no other
aim, then the remooving of all Disorders, the relieving of the People, and
increasing more and more the Happiness within, and the Reputation abroad of
this Commonwealth, Has enboldned me to put your Honors in mind, that the
Coin, when it is ill done, does cause many great disorders in a State, giving
way to the Counterfeiting and Clipping of it, which occasioneth the death of
several persons; besides the transporting of the heaviest pieces out of the
Land, to the great hinderance of the Commerce, and the great loss and
incommodity of the poor people, which is worthy to be taken into consideration,
and to be pitied.

For the remedy of such a disorder the Honorable Council of State had
prudently resolved to have the money well Coined, if they could but meet with
an excellent Workman to have the conduct of that Work: A year since I had
notice of it, whereupon I sent hither some Paterns of Coin, which were esteemed
and approoved of by the said Honorable Council of State, which occasioned my
coming into England; where being arrived, I was very courteously entertained by
the said Honorable Council, who then doubted not but that Doctor Gourdon
Master of the Mint, would be inclinable to a thing so much conducing to the
good, and relief of the People, but it fell out otherwise: For, having applied
my self several times unto the said Doctor, he told me plainly, That if I was
come to be an Officer of the Mint, they were already too many, and that the
Workmen were more then they had need for the Coining of their Money, which they
would do so well, that the State would-be satisfied; And accordingly he did
promise it unto the State.

A while after, the said Workmen Coined some Money, the said Doctor exhorting
them to do it well, and indeed they used their best Skill; yet it did cost
dear unto the State, by reason of the Stamps they spoiled; and was so ill
favouredly done, that it displeased both the People, and those that had any
skill therein.

The Honorable Council of State did since give an Order the 3. of February
last, That the Coin should be better made, and that the Honorable Committee
of the Mint should hearken unto my Proposition; which is, by a new Invention of
mine, to make a handsomer Coin, then it can be found in all the world besides,
viz. That shall not only be Stamped on both Flat-sides, but shall even be
marked with Letters upon the thickness of the Brim, whereby the
Counterfeiting, Casting, and Clipping of the Coin shall be prevented. This way
is much approoved of, and desired by all knowing curious, and understanding
Men, both in the Parliament, and the Honorable Council of State; and even by
most men of all sorts and conditions, who have seen my Patterns, and do
understand the Utility, Profit, and Reputation this Commonwealth will get by
it: But the said Doctor, and the Workmen of the Mint not willing to understand
the damage they cause unto the poor People, and to the State also; and for
their own, and private Interest, have so crossed this business, that no
resolution has been yet taken to procure so much good unto the State, and the
Public.

The said Doctor has told me himself in plain terms, That he would do his
utmost to hinder my Proposition; and for that end he has brought in an Irish
Lock Smith, one David Rammage, a man ill-affected to the present Government,
who has been Servant formerly the late deceased Master Briot, for whom he
forged his Tools, and marked his Brass Counters: which Rammage made a proof of
a very big Brass piece very ill favouredly done, which was marked upon the
Thickness of the Brim, after the old way, which is very tedious, and cannot be
done upon the Thin ordinary Pieces, as I may do by my new Invention.

Further, to hinder that the said Invention of mine should be made use of, the
said Doctor has given out, That it was a thing so easy to be found out, that
the Workmen of the Mint, and any others could Counterfeit the same: And
therefore, that it was as good to Coin the Money of this Commonwealth, as it
is Coined now in France. And that he might undertake it, he caused the said
Irish Smith to be associated with the Workmen of the Mint, saying, He would
do it as well, and cheaper than any body else: The Money Coined that way can
be Cast and Clipped. Yet the Honorable Sir James Harrington desiring to know
their Price, he did bid them draw a Proposition of the lowest price they would
have for, which they did, putting it very low, with no other design, then
thereby to discourage me, and have me go away, that afterward they might fall
again to their old way of Coining as formerly.

To know the truth of this thing, whether my Invention is so easy to be found
out, about three months since an Honorable Member of the Parliament sent my
Proofs to Doctor Gourdon, that he might find it out, or cause it to be found
out by the Workmen of the Mint, or any other, and to know what price they
would have to Coin that way: They have still my Proofs, but could not find out
the Invention, nor Cast them, as the Doctor has given out that it may be done.

It is so easy to know that all such Artifices tend only to amuse the State,
and make me lose both my time and patience; but I hope that your Honors, by
their prudence and generosity will prevent it; not suffering that the pretended
interest of some private men, be any further hindrance or retardment to the
Public Good, or the Glory that will thereby generally happen to the whole
State, but specially to the Honorable Members of the Parliament.

I say, the pretended interest of some private men, because, when I shall have
instructed the Workmen to work after my way, they will have more credit and
profit then by any other way of Coining.

Now to show the affection and desire I have to serve this Commonwealth, and
to live under it, because of the esteem I make of the present Government,
although this way of Coining I do propound be more difficult, and chargeable,
yet I do offer to make it for the very self-same price, and upon the same
terms the Irish Smith and his Associate have demanded to Coin merely after
the French way.

The said price is five Shillings for Coining each pound of Gold, and twelve
Pence for each pound of Silver.

The State does furnish the Gold and Silver in Plate, with the expenses, and
maintaining of the Machins, Tools, Gravers, and all other small Charges
necessary to make the Money.

But if the State be willing that I should undertake to maintain the Machins,
Utensils, and all other small, but necessary, Charges for the perfecting of the
Money, it would be more easy, and less Chargeable to the State. Yet I will
submit to whatsoever your Honors shall Command me.

I most humbly beseech your Honors to take into your serious consideration,
that I have been these nine Months at a great Charge, doing nothing, but still
expecting the Honor of your Commands.

If any man does call to doubt, or question the possibility of what I do
propound, I will make Proof of it without any Charge to the State.
