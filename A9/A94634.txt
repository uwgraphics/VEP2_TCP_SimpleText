To the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor, The Right Worshipful the Aldermen and
Commons of the City of London in the Common or Guildhall of the City of London
assembled.
The humble Petition of the Citizens, Commanders, Officers, and Soldiers of
the trained Bands and Auxiliaries, the Young Men and Apprentices of the Cities
of London and Westminster, Sea Commanders Sea Men and Watermen together with
diverse other Commanders, Officers and Soldiers within the Line of
Communication and Parishes mentioned in the Weekly Bills of Mortality.
Shows,
THat your Petitioners (taking into serious consideration, how Religion, his
Majesty's honor and safety, the Privileges of Parliament, and Liberties of
the Subject are at present greatly endangered and like to be destroyed; And
also sadly weighing with our selves what means might likely prove the most
effectual to procure a firm and lasting peace without a further effussion of
Christian English blood) have therefore entered into a Solemn engagement, which
is hereunto annexed and do humbly, and earnestly desire that this whole City
may join together by all lawful and possible means as one man in hearty
endeavors for his Majesty's present coming up to his two Houses of Parliament
with honor, safety and freedom, (and that without the nearer approach of the
Army) there to confirm such things as he has granted in his Message of the 12
of May last, in answer to the Propositions of both Kingdoms; and that by a
personal treaty with his two Houses of Parliament, and the Commissioners of
the Kingdom of Scotland such things as yet are in difference may be speedily
settled, and a firm and lasting peace established: All which we desire may be
presented to both Houses of Parliament from this honorable Assembly.

And we shall pray, etc.
A solemn engagement of the Citizens, Commanders, Officers and Soldiers of
the Trained bands and Auxiliaries, the young men and Apprentices of the Cities
of London and Westminster: Sea Commanders, Seamen and Watermen, together with
diverse others Commanders, Officers and Soldiers within the Lines of
Communication, and Parishes mentioned in the weekly Bill of Mortality.
WHereas we have entered into a solemn League and Covenant for Reformation and
defense of Religion, the honor and happiness of the King, and the peace and
safety of the three Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland; All which we
do evidently perceive not only to be endangered, but ready to be destroyed; We
do therefore in pursuance of our said Covenant, Oath of Allegiance. Oath of
every Freeman of the Cities of London and Westminster, and Protestations,
solemnly engage our selves, and vow unto Almighty God, that we will to the
utmost of our power cordially endeavor, that his Majesty may speedily come to
his two Houses of Parliament, with honor, safety and freedom, (and that
without the nearer approach of the Army) there to confirm such things as he
has granted in his Message of the twelfth of May last, in answer to the
Propositions of both Kingdoms, and that by a personal Treaty with his two
Houses of Parliament, and the Commissioners of the Kingdom of Scotland, such
things as are yet in difference may be speedily settled, and a firm and lasting
Peace established; For effecting hereof, we do protest and reoblige our selves,
as in the presence of God, the searcher of all hearts with our lives and
fortunes, to endeavor what in us lies, to preserve and defend his Majesty's
royal Person and Authority, the Privileges of Parliament and Liberties of the
Subject in their full and constant freedom: The Cities of London and
Westminster, Lines of Communication and Parishes mentioned in the weekly Bills
of mortality, and all others that shall adhere with us to the said Covenant*
Oath of Allegiance, Oath of every Freeman of London and Westminster, and
Protestation; nor shall we by any means admit, suffer, or endure any kind of
neutrality in this common cause of God, the King, and Kingdoms, as we do
expect the blessing of Almighty God, whose help we crave, and wholly devolue
our selves upon, in this our undertaking.
