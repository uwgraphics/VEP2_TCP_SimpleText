The Right honorable the Earl of Warwick his Speech.
MY Lords and Gentlemen, upon this happy victory that you have had, for which
you have given God thanks this day, the Parliament understand, that the King
and your enemies are presently drawing into the Field, and they are drawing all
their Forces into the Field to come against you; And the Parliament upon this
have thought fit to draw all their Forces into the Field, that (with Gods
blessing upon them) they may make an end of these unhappy distractions that are
amongstus; And they hope, that as you have been very forward and active in
this cause of God, and the public liberty, so you will not be wanting now,
in drawing your selves into the Field, with all our Armies, to defend Gods
cause and the public liberty; The rest (my Lord) I shall leave to some
worthy Gentlemen of the House of Commons.

Sir Henry Vane his Speech.
MY Lord Mayor, and worthy Aldermen, and the rest of the Gentlemen of the City
of London; The Houses of Parliament have seldom in matters of any great
importance, but been ready to communicate them unto your selves, as knowing
how nearly you have interested your selves with them, in these public
dangers, and for the public liberties of the Kingdom, and preservation of
Religion; At this time above all the rest, they have thought it necessary, to
acquaint you with a resolution which they have take, in regard that as they
have had former experiences of your ready affections in all cases of exigency
to assist them, and in them your selves, and the whole kingdom, so they do
not doubt but at this time, they shall be prevented by your own inclinations;
considering that what they have now in hand, is, if it can be possible, to put
a speedy issue to these unhappy, and to these lingering distractions that we
have had thus many years together; The occasion of their resolution is this,
It having pleased God, by the late overthrow which he gave the enemy by Sir
William Wallers Forces, for to occasion the enemy now to draw out all his
Garrisons, to endeavor to take the Field with all the power he can make, and
if it be possible to come suddenly upon those Forces that so lately routed
them; The Parliament thought it wisdom and providence for to give order for
all their Forces on the South side Trent, those under my Lord Manchesters
association, those likewise of the several Garrisons that can be spared,
those also of his Excellency my Lord Generals Army that at this time is in a
hopeful way of recruting, and likewise in the last place those that they might
expect from your own ready affections; They have known your willingness, they
have known your watchfulness at all times, for to comply with their
occasions, and with the necessities of the Commonwealth; at this time they
doubt not, but you will be the more encouraged to it, because (through the
blessing of God) it may put an issue unto this war, at least, it is that as
is in the Parliaments desire, and will be in their endeavors they have
therefore thought fit thus publicly to recommend this business to you, to
quicken your affections, which are at all times very much stirred up for their
service, and they doubt not therefore will be to this; They desire you
therefore, as knowing the several ways, that you have among your selves, for
subscriptions, for contributions, for setting out those that are of able
bodies, and of good affections to the cause; knowing how much that this City
has sent forth, and those persons, that have been an honor to the City, in
behaving themselves with that gallantry, as that it may be truly said, That
the enemy does apprehend no Forces like unto those that come out of this city,
being persons, that for Religion for courage, for faithfulness to the cause,
and for publiquenesse of spirit to the Parliament, have ever showed themselves
as firm, and as forward as any whatsoever; They do not doubt but you will
show your selves so at this time also, and acquit your (...) like men, which is
that as I am for to recommend to you; There are others that I doubt not will
follow, will do it with a great deal of more exactness then I can do, but
this is the substance as I can remember.

His Excellency the Lord General his Speech.
MY Lords and Gentlemen, you have here understood by a noble Lord my Lord
Admiral, and this Noble Gentleman of the House of Commons, the desire of both
Houses of Parliament, they have acquainted you too, what the Kings intention
is, to draw all his Forces together, and what the Parliament does intend in
drawing all their Forces they can Southward, and what great victory God has
given Sir William Balfore and Sir William Waller, so I am only to take this
opportunity to give you all acknowledgements and thanks for those great aides
that I have had always to go along with me; for I must needs acknowledge,
that most of the things that have been done by me, especially the business
at Gloucester, have been done by your helps; I should desire the like still;
and what shall come to me I shall use with good respects, and venture my life
with them; and I should have been very glad that my Army had been in that
case, that I might not have needed to take any of you from your own homes,
knowing how much expense you have been at already both in your estates, and
blood, in the service of Religion and this cause; But whatsoever Forces you
please to draw out, I shall venture my life with them, and be ready to give a
quick end to this cause:

To be at their Rendezvous the 19. of this month, about Ailesbury.

The Right Honorable the Earl of Pembrook his Speech.
GEntlemen, I am a very ill Speaker, but I thank God, I am a very dutiful
subject to God, and to the Kingdom, and in this cause; though I am an ill
Orator, yet I have a good heart, and I cannot be silent in such a cause as
this is: I shall not need to trouble you with the effects of the cause,
because so many of my Lords, and Gentlemen have opened it you; but I shall not
forget in the name of both Houses to give you many thanks, both my Lord Major,
and all the City, for all the love and affection you have showed not only
now, but heretofore, and above all that ever any of your Ancestors did; for
though the City of London have showed themselves with abundance of love to the
Kingdom, and have been instruments of saving the cause, yet they have never
gained so much honor, as in these times; for I must needs say, That under God
it is the love and fidelity of this City has saved all; and therefore I may
desire you for your own honors, that you would so second it now in these
times, that God has given you so fair an opportunity for it, I think you
have little to do, but to go on in it; And you see what accidents had been
like to fall out (as my Lord General told you) for want of recruting his Army
heretofore; I speak not this, to show that it is any fault of yours, but let
us not lose this opportunity; and let these experiences make us know to help
our failings hereafter; For (as my Lord General has told you) if my Lord
Generals Army had been ready we might have put an end to this business, but
I doubt not, but your care, and your love, and your fidelity will make that
issue, that will quit the Kingdom of all those Villains that have been the
cause of all this.

Collonell Hollis his Speech.
MY Lord Major and Citizens of this famous City, whith have done so famous
things for Religion, for the Parliament, for the whole Kingdom, truly there
needs not many words to encourage you, your own affections prevent all that
can be said; you have been sufficiently told the occasion of this meeting
with you by these Committees, which are sent from the two Houses of Parliament;
your own wisdoms does sufficiently inform you of the necessity of doing
that which is now desired of you by these Lords here, and these Gentlemen that
have spoken before; It has pleased God to give us a very great advantage by
that happy success which God gave to the endeavors of that gallant. Gentleman
Sir William Balsore, and that other gallant Gentleman Sir William Waller; It
behooves us to improve this occasion; And it has been the wisdom of all
States, as it is the duty of all Christians, to meet Gods blessings, and to
go along with them; But truly besides this, there is a necessity lies upon
you too, for there is as great a wisdom to meet the enemy and to prevent him
in his designs; he is now drawing and assembling all his Forces together, and
therefore you are not only invited unto it by such reasons as wisdom may
suggest unto you, but by such forcible arguments as necessity imposes to you;
This is necessary for you to do for your preservation; My Lord General, (who
has spoken to you) he has told you how ready, and how willing he is to
engage himself, to adventure his person, his life, his fortunes, all that he
has with you; he has had experience of your fidelity before, and has
received the fruits of it several times, and that makes him (I am sure) the
more cheerfully offer himself to you again; and we all know your affections
to him to be such, as you will not suffer him to go into the field, but as
the General of the Forces raised by the Parliament for the defense of Religion
and Liberty; If his Army had been recruted, this had not been needful unto
you at this time, but it has pleased God so, that other occasions have
diverted it, that his Army not being recruted, for then he would have been
willing to have spared you; He knows how much it concerns the wealth and
trade of this City, that you should keep at home to follow your occasions
here, and that your purses (as they have always been) should have been open
to supply the wants of the Army, he would have spared you; but now the
Parliament throw themselves on your affections, and desire you to offer your
selves as one man, for it is to no purpose to go by little and little, it is
but as a little water thrown on the fire that does but enrage it, and will not
quench it: But now if all will join their purses, their persons, and their
prayers together, I doubt not but we shall through Gods blessing see an end of
these miserable and distracted times; And the Lord put it into your hearts to
do that which is fit for you to do, which we know you will do.

Mr. Recorder his Speech.
GEntlemen, I am commanded by these Lords and Gentlemen (that are come from
both Houses of Parliament, to present what already they have spoken) to add
one word more: First, you have had notice of the great blessing that God
Almighty has been pleased to bestow on us, by the late victory, and you have
now the experience of the care of both Houses of Parliament to ascribe that
blessing unto God Almighty, by setting apart this day, for to give him thanks
for it; and they have thought it a day of opportunity, when we all join in
Prayer and Thanksgiving unto God Almighty, that we should now again meet at
this time to improve that blessing, and therefore it has been set out unto
you, that you would be pleased, in pursuance of what both Houses of Parliament
have resolved, and my Lord General, to draw all the Forces that they can get
together unto a general Rendezvous about Ailesbury, the nineteenth of this
month, all the Forces have directions to draw together; And now they do apply
themselves unto you, (having had experience of your great affections, and God
having wrought so much by the Forces, that you have sent abroad) to desire tha
you would now at this time, (which we hope will give an issue to all our
troubles) show your affections by sending out as many Forces as you can, to
join in this work, to make a speedy end of it; Only I shall add this word to
it; my Lord General is recruting his Army, both Houses of Parliament have put
him in a way, and now he desires your assistance and concurrence only to
help him, with the bodies of men, that every man in his particular work what
he can, that that Army may be raised, as shortly as possibly may be; There
shall be no want in both Houses of Parliament, or my Lord General, and they
are all confident, there shall be no want in you; and that is that they have
commanded me to add, and God put it into your hearts to do what shall be
best unto him.

FINIS.
