I PROCLAIM From the Lord of HOSTS The return of the JEWS From their
Captivity, and the Building of the TEMPLE in Glory, in their own LAND.


Hear O ye Jew^s my Brethren, I am a Jew of the Tribe of Reuben: but unknown
to me till the Lord spoke unto me by voice: whose Voice I heard, but saw no
appearance, and He changed my Name from Thomas to Theaurau John, since the 23
of November 1649.

Now unto ye Jews, my Brethren, am I sent to proclaim from the Lord of Hosts,
the God of Israel, your R^turne from your Captivity in what Nation soever ye
are Scattered. From thence ye shall be Gathered into your own Land: and
JERUSALEM shall be built in Glory, in her own Land, even ^n her own
foundation, as the Lord has shown me, though it seem never so impossible in
the Judgment of Men* Yet by him that lives foreverm^re, it shall be
accomplished. And ye my Brethren, who say, Our Bones are dried, and our hope is
gone, and we are clean cut off. As the Lord Lives, who brought our Fathers
out of the Land of Egypt, so SVRE shall you Return be. And ye my Brethren,
shall be the Glory of all the Earth, and the fear of Nations, For I saw the
SPIRIT of the LORD go forth, to Effect His own WORK, and for his own Names
sake will He bring this ^reat Thing to pass.

Therefore my Brethren, Fear not; neither be afraid, for the Lord of Hosts is
your Leador. And I Theaurau-John His Servant your Br^ther.

This Year 1650, is the Lord beginning to make away for ye my Brethren.
