OXFORD, Printed by H. H. Printer to the University, for Thom. Robinson, 1657.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE PHILIP VICOUNT LISLE etc. One of the Lords of the
COUNCIL.
My LORD,
IF the subject which I have chosen, were habited in such apparel, as belongs
to it; the world that knows so well your Lordship's accomplishments, would
less blame me of presumption in demanding your eye and countenance. But I know
not what inclination to your person, having been the more elevated by some
particular favor, makes me promise to my self I know not what acceptance
above merit: a thing wherein I should as much flatter my self from the glorious
name of Sr PHILIP SIDNEY, were he now living to be my Patron. But you, my LORD,
or no other, being heir of his perfections, as you are of a higher QUALITY to
adorn them, I humbly present this simple dress of truth and reallity (so far
as I could attain to it) to be credited by your Lordships name, which is a
great authority to any intelligence of this nature (especially FRANCE within
the sphere) and cloaked with your Lordships favor, which however bounteous
makes no largess unadvisedly, that so it may not fail to be recommended to
such spirits, as are more curious, in a mode of readier entertainment. Wherein
you shall oblige infinitely,

My LORD, Your LORDSHIP'S most humble and most affectionate humble Servant THO:
TANNER.

TO THE INGENUOUS READER.
IT needs not to usher in ashort story with a long preface: yet I count it a
part of civilitie, that I am bound to observe, since I bring a small present to
the Public to say somewhat in delivering of it, about my self and my
intention; which happily may serve for a just apology to the undertaking of
one, that yet has scarce seen the world beyond five lustres. I have had the
happiness to pass some time at my own pleasure in acquanting my self with
the principal parts of EUROPE: and having had no greater satisfaction in any
other either exercise, or diversion, then to gain a true intelligence of the
present age, wherein I live, to be compared with what I hear and read, I have
added some study to my observation, that so descending a little lower, I might
the better know the Causes, and Connection of things that are now upon the
stage. And when I had well furnished my self with those perquisites, that
belonged to this end, I found my notes growing too tedious to be almost ready
for the fire. Only first I desired to draw out some of the choicer remarques,
and then leave the rest to the sentence. But setting my self to this business
I knew not how to form any one design; till at last, finding my references to
this subject, that I now exhibit to the common light, more exquisite then the
rest, as touching a critical part of History, and more difficult to be
collected then such as run in the ordinary periods of Kings lives, I took up my
books again, being now moved with an emulation of deserving, if I might
possibly, the public thanks. Wherein if I find not my self disappointed,
there may be a second part added to complete this argument, by pursuing it to
the end of the first years REGENCY, which might suffice, with the benefit of
some Memoires lately published in our own language, to extend a clear Horizon
of intelligence to the present time and place of prospect.

The ENTRANCE of MAZZARINI.
IT may be thought admirable ^o such, as being forrainers to the French; have
not been somewhat curious to knit their ends of intelligence, how the present
high engine of that Monarchy, being himself a forrainer, and borne a subject
of their Grand enemy, the King of Spain, should arrive at that place, where he
now governs: especially considering that these two emulous Nations, howsoever
continually intrigued to out-bid one another for the amity of their neighbors,
are yet alike propellers of them from their political interestly. They both
court equally every Italian (and he again is as great a courtier of them both)
but it is to get the rule over them, and not to be ruled by them, wherein they
reciprocally understand one another, and vie it out in policy; so that all
parties serving their own turn keeps the balance even. The Italians upon
occasion lend their interest; the opposite parties lend their strength which is
the cause why the first can never want at their pleasure to have honorable
commands in either armies: but for intrinsecating in their civil government
(if I may so speak) this Mazzarini is the first example; and that also at such
a time and state of affairs, which happened by dissension of the Princes, when
there was no other to advise with him or command his actions, besides the
daughter of SPAIN, and sister of the present PHILIP, with whom the war was
commenced. I shall therefore take some pleasure to go a little forth with my
Reader to meet this Cardinal, and so follow him with his train from his first
scene of Italy to his second of France, where we intend to consider him in his
first act of fortune: for he has been as great a subject of strange
concurrences of events in his own person, as any other. Nor is it any
disparagement to his personal sufficiency, since whom it pleases God to
advance above others, he commonly endoweth more.

The Card. Mazzarini was a soldier, a courtier, put into the prelacy, and made
a Nuntio by one and twenty, and in these severally knew his game so well, that
it might be soon seen he was not to throw for small matters. Savoy was the
tennis-court, which first admired his dexterity, where he saved Casale, and
therein the whole French interest (at that time) toward Lombardy, before his
play, being very serious, was discovered; and then hitting also Pignerol into
their hazard, by his incomparable address in treating that Duke, he went off
with the great regret of the Spaniards, and applause of his Frenchmen. The
former in recompense of his services, sought to ruin his interests at Rome, as
a traitor to both the Pope and the Catholic King. And it seemed the Pope had
been much injured in his quality of Umpire, by the partiality of his Nuncio,
who therefore found it most convenient to accept of the Savoyards courtesy for
a time, till his interests might be adjusted. But the Card. of RICHELIEU had a
greater passion to receive and remerce him at the Court of France, where he so
entertained him, that he made his pretensions good to the hat (the usual
reward of those Nuncio's, that return with a re been gesta) by the continual
applications of the French Ministers at Rome; but would never let him go
thither to receive it. And now being qualified with the title of Cardinal, he
procures the King to nominate him as his pleny-potentiary for the General
peace, which was no less then to entrust him with the interests of the Crown
and of its confederates: and accordingly Richelieu now treats with him,
disjoining every spring, and parcelling every implement of his breast to
discover to him; and the quality of this employment might allow time for it,
for it was not presently to be entered on. In the interim, this new creature to
commend his Services the more dearly to the Crown, undertakes two famous
treaties to reduce the Princes of Savoy from the interests of Spain to the
contrary of France: The first was concluded and signed; but the sudden breaking
out of the Counts of Soissons and Bouillon hindered the effect, and gave the
Cardinal leisure (as some would have it) being now nigh upon the place, to
gain also the Prince of Monaco, whose accession afterward was accounted of
great consequence. The second treaty brought the first to an issue, reuniting
those Princes at the same time to the side of France, and to the head of their
house, the then Infant-Duke of Savoy: an union whereunto the most part of the
places conquered in Piemont and Montferrat is ascribed. After his return from
these affairs, he accompanies the Cardinal of Richelieu in that voyage; which
brought Cincmars (the grand Escuyer, and his competitor in the Kings favor)
his designs to the light, and his head to the block: but while the Cardinal
Duke is urging still his jealousies to greater envy in this business, this
other Cardinal finds himself a better work to persuade the Duke of Bouillon,
one of the Accomplices, to deliver up his sovereignty of Sedan to the Kings
power, as a ransom for his treason, which accordingly he obtained, and the
King seized. This was the gate by which Mazzarini entered equally into
Richelieu's and the King's favor, but especially by the douceur and
gentleness of his proceeding, which made the King desire his employment; being
inwardly weary of Richelieu's excessive, and now more intemperate rule by
reason of his malady: so that that favorite could not comply better with the
King's pleasure in any other suit then this of serving himself of Mazzarini:
in whose person both might find their private ends, as well as their public.
The Cardinal might raise in him a Protector of his house and kindred against
their most incensed emulators; and the King find a subject by whom to balance
the Princes of the Blood, when he was gone; especially the Duke of Orleans,
against whose sway he devised all means possible to provide.

The Cardinal of Richelieu had took his fortune, as it were, to farm,
putting his term of life into the lease, which was therefore to be
circumscribed with his Master's: for had he outlived him, it is a question
whether all his admirable expedients could have served to repress a harder
fate, which being instigated by much envy would feign have stetched a long arm
to reach him. And the sense of this, while the King's health seemed to decay
faster then his own, had cast the Cardinal into many pangs of contrivances,
how to make his estate good, when his plea in chief was gone. Sometimes to
reconcile himself with his grand enemies, especially the Queen whom he had
highly disobliged: Sometimes to get the King's children to his own power and
wardship; sometimes to ruin or at least how to balance the Duke of Orleans;
and sometimes to retire, for which purpose he had laid up a vast sum of
ready gold at Haure de Grace, and had purchased in the King's name and
license, but with his own money, A soverainty on the Meuse, with Chastean
Reynaud, and a territory adjacent, whereby he doubted not but to render
himself considerable both to France and the neighbor Princes, without any
fear of his enemies. But all this was in vain, for death took him at the
best time, at the bound of his glory, The news of the taking of Tortona in the
state of Milan coming to Paris the same day to bring new Laurells to his
hearse. But when he was about to die, he may seem to have overreached his
fortune, and driven her beyond her intention, in leaving her favors to his
successors in a way scarce before observed: for besides his leaving a creature
of his own to survive in; he bequeathed the most important charges of the
Kingdom under the King's good pleasure (who accordingly allowed of his
disposal in all; but a few church livings, and that only to save the
prerogative which the Kings of France claim in such causes) to his own
kindred: which proved a great disappointment to his enemies, for they soon
found that they could not pluck up his residue without the danger of the whole.
Then he recommended to the King the Officers and Ministers of state as he was
to leave them, particularly the Secretaries de Chauvigny and de Noyers, wherein
he promised his majesty, he might continue to prosper as he had thither to. The
King accepts well of his advice, resolves to use the same instruments that he
had before: but never to admit the like partager in his royal authority, as
the Cardinal of Richelieu had been. For the Cardinal Mazzarini he forth with
makes him president of his council, committing the Secretaries of state to his
orders, which in effect was to make him his prime Minister.

My purpose is to digest some memorialls from this period: yet I cannot leave
that great subject (before mentioned) till I have brought him to his funeral.
Not that I intend any long digression to bring in the Ceremonies of his
interring: but only to note one or two circumstances on this occasion, which
have respect to some ensuing passages. The first was the composing of an
ancient difference between Cardinals and the Princes of the blood about
precedencie, which before was only regulated by the Kings favor. Now they
agree with mutual satisfaction, that in the Churches and Ecclesiastical
functions, the Cardinal should have priority; in other places the Princes; and
in other things should treat one another with equality: Whereupon the Prince of
Conde and his son the Duke of Enguien come to visit the Cardinal Mazzarini.
The second is this; There was a chair covered with velvet and somewhat raised,
set for the Cardinal Mazzarini in the church of Nostre-dame in Paris, where
the obsequies were to be solemnized, which occasioned a hot dispute about the
manner of being seated, betwixt the said Cardinal and the Bishops; these
pretending that he should stand in the same rank with them; and among these
the Archbishop of Rheims and Bishop of Beauvais were most earnest, breaking
out into high words, in saying, That with other Cardinals for dignity, birth,
and merit more regardable then he, there never fell the like pretension. This
offense the Cardinal was feign to digest at that time, not without straining a
dissimulation* but found opportunity afterward to turn it on the authors, to
a greater jacture of their reputation. Richelieu is now covered, the court is
soon filled with such as had fled or retired: The new Ministers are as
diligent to make new friends, sueing for some that were proscribed the court
(among whom Monsieur de Baradas, and the Duke of St Simon who had been both
favorites and afterward disgraced, were graciously received by his Majesty)
For others that were Tower'd in the Bastille (among whom were the Mareschaux de
Vitry and de Bassompierre with the Duke of Cramail, which last are set at
liberty; but to retire and keep themselves confined at their own places.)
The Queen her self also by the Bishop of Lisieux, sends intimation to the
Duke of Beaufort, then fled into England, to avoid answering upon suspicion
about the late conspiracy of the Grand Escuyer, to return into France, and
with his Father the Duke of Vendosme a while after to the court; and the like
to the Madam of Guise, and her sons at Florence, the occasion of whose
persecutions is not here to be recounted.

Lewis XIII.
From the beginning of December 1642.
The first act of state wherein the King would be seen by himself was the
sending for the * Parliament to express his mind thus to them.

I would have you verify the arrest which my Attorney General shall read to
you against my brother, for that being so often relapsed into the same errors,
after I have so often pardoned Him, I can no longer bear it, having reason to
doubt least He hatch some design pernicious to my state. Wherefore I am
resolved to take the means from Him, and for the future to render Him unable
to wrong my Queen, and Children after my death, by excluding Him for ever from
the GOVERNMENT. My CHANCELLOR will declare the rest of my intentions to you.

After which the first president offers some remonstrances in behalf of
Monsieur, in regard of his Quality, which might well pass as a complement, but
when the matter came to be reported, notwithstanding the, great instances of
Mademoiselle, it was accordingly verified shortly after. The declaration is in
my judgment not only pertinent to illustrate, and be compared with other
ensuing passages; but as one of the foresaid great designs of the late
Minister, worthy to be at large inserted.

LOVIS, by the grace of God, King of France and Navarre; To all to whom the
present letters shall come, greeting. When we consider in what manner our most
dear and beloved only Brother the Duke of Orleans, has behaved himself
toward us, we cannot without wonder reflect on all the enterprises which he
has undertaken against our Service. We may say in truth that, never was any
son of France charged with so great favors by the King his brother, and who
has less acknowledged them. Our love has always been so great toward his
Person, that his ingratitude has not been able to make us change the purpose
that we have had to ingratiate him; insomuch that at the same time when he has
set himself against our service, we have continually sought to reduce him, not
omitting any means to oblige him thereunto. But all these good offices which
should have been as so many cords to bind him to us the more straightly, have
not proved strong enough to hinder him from joining with our feircest enemies,
and advancing their designs. The Conspiracies of Chales wrought under his name
and with his consent in the year 1626 gave us the first experiment of his ill
will. He incited our Cousin the Duke of Espernon against our service to seize
himself of the City and Citadell of Metz, wherein we used such bounty that we
were willing to forget that failing, contenting our selves to punish only the
delinquency of Chales. When we were obliged to go into Piemont to the succor
of our confederats, where the only appearing of our arms secured their peace,
we were no sooner returning from this expedition, but he severed himself from
us, retiring in the year 1629 without occasion to the Duke Charles of
Lorraine. Although this action so extravagant in a time when all France and our
allies expressed their resentments for the happy success of our journey, gave
us great occasion of disgust toward him: yet covering his failings, we did not
cease to make him way to return to us, changing the chastisements which he
deserved into so many favors which we did him, augmenting his appanages, and
giving him the government of Orleans and Amboyse: However so favorable
entertainment might have obliged him to reunite inseparably to our interests;
nevertheless a while after he departs from Paris, returning to Orleans, and in
suite to Lorrain in the year 1631, where wounding the fundamental Laws of
our state he married himself against our will to the sister of Duke Charles,
which marriage being accomplished he flies to Brussells in the year 1632,
putting himself in the power of our enemies, who induced him to enter
hostilely armed into our Kingdom, to join himself in Languedoc to the forces
of a faction which he had formed with the Duke of Monmorency, which faction
being then dispersed and broken by our arms, we received him the third time
into our grace. We thought that our aforesaid Brother, being affected with so
many tokens of our good will, would at last apply himself to the resolution of
holding to his duty; but we had scarce abandoned Languedoc to return to Paris,
ere he went the third time out of our State, and ligued himself anew with the
King of Spain taking his part against us. In which appeared his ill will by so
much the greater, in that he had not sought or received our grace at Besie^es,
but to be able to abuse it the more easily, by removing those obstacles, that
(without this) would have been inevitable to him in the passage by him
premeditated, and resolved into Flanders. This bad carriage did not hinder in
the least, but that, when he withdrew himself from the ill treatment of the
Spaniards, resolving to set himself at liberty by returning to our person,
with intention to acknowledge his fault, we should again freely pardon him the
fourth time. A little while after, having notice given us in France that his
actions were not such as we might desire, and that he followed the pernicious
counsels of the Duke of Puy-Laurens, we became necessitated, to prevent a
greater evil, to cause the aforesaid Duke to be arrested, to obliege the more
our said Brother to unite himself the more strictly with us, and to render us
the honor and the service which is due to us. We did him in this respect all
the good offices which he could expect from our affection, even to honor him
with the command of the most flourishing and numerous army which of a long
time has been seen in our Kingdom. Instead of conducting our forces so
vigorously as he might have done against the armies of our enemies, which had
surprised a fortress on our frontier of Picardy; the suggestion of the Count
of Soissons and of the Duke of Valette had so much power over him, that they
plotted together to employ them against our selves. But being averted from that
pernicious design by the notice which they had, that they could never so
dispose of the soldiery, the said Count of Soissons retires to Sedan, and our
foresaid brother to Blois in the year 1636, with intention to pass thence
into Cuienne. We pursued him thence to Orleans, where he giving us to
understand the displeasure which he had taken in agreeing to such designs,
obtained from us the fifth pardon for this fault, with the same facility as the
rest. In virtue of this last grace as his actions in the course of some years
past had given us to believe that he would be far from lending ear any more
for the future to such counsels as he had before harkened to, we readily
condescended, as we had done on diverse occasions, to grant him all effects
that he might possibly expect from our goodness. The opinion therefore which
we had conceaved of his good disposition cleared us of all doubt to have seen
him in the last Campaign at Roussyllon. But notwithstanding some promise given
us, he prolonged the execution, under various excuses, which made us judge that
he was contriving some ill design. And when we were travailing to discover it,
God vouchsafed us the favor to inlighten us about the detestable conspiracy,
which had formed a powerful party in our state, and established a treaty with
Spain It Is true that we remained greatly amazed that our foresaid Brother the
Duke of Orleans, from whom we might have expected all manner of assistance for
the sustenance of the prosperity of our arms, should attempt to uphold our
enemies, and put himself in the head of their forces, to enter on our State,
while we were employed in a great seige. We were then most intimately affected
to see that neither the innumerable benefits, nor graces, which we had on
diverse occasions granted him with such bounty, nor the love of his Country, nor
the glory of a Crown, in the interests whereof he has so great a part by his
birth; could retain him in his duty, and that he would rather, by violating
all these sacred respects, pursue an unjust passion to raise the grandeur of
our enemies upon the ruins of our own. The resentment notwithstanding which
we were to have of such and so many offenses did nothing hinder; but (as soon
as our foresaid Brother did acknowledge and confess his fault, with promise
for the future to remove far from his Person all such malignant spirits, and
those particularly which we nominated) we did what possibly in us lay, to draw
him from the peril wherein he had precipitated himself. We contented our
selves to punish only two of the principal authors of the crime, agreeing for
this time also, to reject any memory of his ill conduct.

But as Nature has given us these good inclinations, and made us second them
with advantageous dealings; so we judge that these favors are to be regulated
with the good of our Crown, and the interest of our Children. These motives
have persuaded us, that it was of necessary consequence to take from our
foresaid Brother those means, which might for the future lead him to disturb
the peace of our State, suppressing his companies of men at Arms, and
Light-Horses; and depriving him, at the present, of the Government of Auvergne,
wherewith we had gratified him; and for the future of all sort of
administration in this State, and especially in the Regencie, during the
minority of our children, in case God should call us to himself before the
years of their majority: whereunto we are moved with so much the juster
reason, forasmuch as it is impossible to apprehend otherwise, then the
continuing of bad intentions of a person that (in the middle of our
prosperities, and in the strength of our power, in a time when all our subjects
do conspire in one vote for the goodissue of our designs) has solicited the
King of Spain to furnish him with forces and moneys to make war upon us, and
on condition to make no treaty with us, without remitting into our enemies
hands, all the fortresses gained from them, or acquired by Princes our
confederates. And in effect, if the perilous state, whereinto a grievous
infirmity has brought us, during this Campaign, has not at all touched his
Heart, as we are informed to the contrary, by the deposition of the accomplices
of his conspiracy, that he has assured a design to the Spaniards after our
decease, besides the party which he could make in our State, that he had
fortified himself with other Foreign correspondences; we should be needs
insensible of the good of our Realm, which is more dear to us then our life,
not to fear and foresee, that if our foresaid Brother, should have one day in
his hands, the power of the Regencie, in the weakness and minority of a young
King, he might suffer himself to be drawn to raise troubles, and divisions,
which might produce ruins to our State, more then the grandeurs which we have
acquired by all our travels. Wherefore we make it known, that of our own
motion, especial grace, full power, and Royal authority, we have forgotten,
remitted, and pardoned to our foresaid Brother the Duke of Orleans, the fault
by him committed, in making a faction in our State, and establishing a treaty
with the King of Spain, and we permit him to enjoy his pensions and appanage,
wherein he may freely sojourn without transferring himself to our Court,
unless he have first obtained our licenc in good and valid form: which
notwithstanding we have declared, and do declare by our same power and Royal
authority, that we have suppressed, and do suppress his companies of men of
arms, and light horses, we have deprived, and do deprive him of his government
of Auvergne; and ordained, and do ordain, that he may never for the future have
any government in this Kingdom, nor be Regent during the minority of our
Children, and thereof we have declared, and by these presents do declare him
incapable, for the considerations and reasons above specified. And so we
command our beloved and faithful subjects, which hold our Court of the
Parliament of Paris, and the other Courts of Parliament, that they cause these
present Letters of Declaration to be read, published, and registered, when they
shall be presented to them by our Attorney General, notwithstanding any
Letters, Edicts, Ordinances, Reglements, Arrests, or any thing else to the
contrary, for so is our pleasure. In testimony whereof we have caused our Seal
to be put to these presents. Given at S. Germans the first of December, in the
year of Grace 1642. and of our Reign the 33.

Subscribed LOVIS. And below Par le Roy. De Lomenie.
Read, published, and registered by express commandment of our Lord the King.
Heard, and upon the instance of his Attorney General, to be executed according
to their forms and tenor. At Paris in the Parliament the 9. of December 1642.




The Duke of Orleans is now overbal lanced; but we shall soon find the scale in
other hands, which afford him more allowance. In the mean time, let us see
another expedient, the King takes to comply with his friends, and raise his
reputation of independency, which was to direct letters to his Ministers abroad
giving an account of his intentions; One of which to his Ambassador at Venice
was of this tenor.

Monsieur des Hameaux,
Since every one knows the great and signal services, which my Cousin the
Cardinal of Richelieu has done me, and with what advantageous successes it
has pleased God to bless those counsels which He suggested to me, so no one
can doubt but the loss of so faithful and good a Minister cannot but be
nearly sensible to me, and so I would have all the world know how great
displeasure I have conceived here by, and how dear his memory is to me, by the
testimonies which I shall render on all occasions. But the knowledge that I
have that the thoughts of well governing of my State, and for the good of my
affairs ought to prevail above all others, does oblige me to take care now
more then ever, and to apply my self in such manner, that I may be able to
maintain the great advantages hitherto obtained, 'till it shall please God to
grant us a peace, the sole and only scope of my enterprises, and for the
gaining of which I will not spare my own life. To this purpose I have taken
resolution to retain the same persons in my council, which have served me
during the Ministry of my Cousin the Cardinal of Richelieu, and to take to me
my Cousin the Cardinal Mazzarini, who has given me so great proofs of his
affection and fidelity, and of his capacity in diverse occasions wherein he has
been by me employed, rendering to me most considerable services, so that I can
no less assure my self of him, then if he had been born my subject. My
principal thought shall ever be to maintain the good union and correspondence
which has been between us and our confederates, to use the same vigor and
constancy in my affairs, which I have hitherto held, as far as justice and
reason may permit me, and to continue the war with the same application and the
same forces that I have done since my enemies constrained me to make it, till
such time as God shall touch their Hearts, that I may contribute with all my
other confederates somewhat to the establishment and general peace of
Christendom, but so established that nothing for the future may disturb it.
You shall therefore communicate what is above expressed to the Republic of
Venice, to the Ministers of the Princes of Italy, which are there, and to all
others that you shall think fit, that they may judge that the affairs of this
Kingdom hold the same course that they have heretofore, and that nothing will
be wanting to their good conduct, assuredly hoping that they shall ever
continue happily. Whereupon I pray God to keep you Monsieur des Hameaux in his
holy custody.

Dated at Paris the 6 of December 1642. LOVIS. Bouthilier.


In pursuance of these his resolutions, his Majesty forthwith issues a
proclamation commanding all officers of war, of whatsoever quality, to depart
from Paris by the beginning of February, and render themselves to the actual
exercise of their charges, with a purpose to part himself in person in the
Month of March, to begin the next campaign. But the preparations for it did not
answers the King's desire through the slacknesse of those instruments, which
being now out of fear of the late Cardinal, and finding a more remiss hand
(as the more remote is wont to be) carried over them, did regulate their
actions to their own commodities. So that now the two emulous Monarchies were
counterpoised only by a reciprocal kind of fate, that one could get no start
upon the impediments of the other. For about the same time, that the Cardinal
Duke of RICHELIEU died in France, the Count-Duke of OLIVAREZ fell in Spain: and
that King resolves in like manner to return his Royal authority on his own
person: and so for a few months kept his business in his own hands,
imparting them with indifferency to his Ministers, and referring their dispatch
to several Councils, where they lay a long time sleeping; and the King, having
lived 22 years in repose, began now to find more unpliancy in his affairs then
he expected; and thereupon to discover some change of his resolution by
inclining to a new favorite, which at last rises with great expectation in the
person of D. Lewis de Haro (nephew of the Count of Castriglio the present
Viceroy of Naples) who beginning his course almost as soon, (and without any
opposition) as his corrivall inreputation, may seem to have lost nothing in the
setting out.

In the interim the arms of both nations are not idle, and the suite of those
councils, which had issued from their late Dictators (subjects both of them of
extraordinary finesses) though intercised from their heads; yet run out their
courses: especially in the two Republics of Venice and Holland, which were
highly to be courted at this time. Of the first of which we have somewhat ready
to insert here.

There had happened lately in Italy a war merely Italian, neither French nor
Spanish having any hand in it, nor knowing how to intermeddle in it, though
they sought many ways to inultratetheir practices about the Quarrel. A war it
was not very violent; but full of expedients in the managing, in the treating,
and in composing of it, the occasion was the seizing of the Duchy of Castro (a
place lying conveniently near to Rome, and bordering upon the Duke of Florence
his dominions, but belonging to the Duke of Parma) by the Nephews of Urban the
eight, pretending to satisfy the Montists in Rome, to whom that Prince was much
indebted: the Republic of Venice, the Duke of Florence, and the Duke of
Modena, as Friends and Neighbors to the Duke of Parma, or as jealous of the
Ecclesiastical State since the accruing of the new estates of Urbino and
Ferrara, or as no well wishers to the Barberini, ligue together to aid and
restore the said Duke to his sequestered Duchy: the French and Spaniards hold
themselves a while Spectators, as if they were to study their interests in this
emergent, the Spaniards for the hate they bare the Barberini, and for the love
which they secretly hugged of the Pope's trouble, could well have bin contented
with the war, but that they equally hated the progress of the league, their
jealous Neighbors, whom they desired to overawe, wherefore when the Pope was
very Importunate by his Nuntio Panziroli at Madrid to get that King to Join
with the Pope, and to declare himself against the league, as also to supply
him with the succors of 900 horse and 3000 foot, which the King of Spain is
bound to furnish the Pope withal, when his estates are invaded, by virtue of
his Fief of Naples, the Spaniard returned but formal answers, as expressing
his thought to be that the restitution of Castro was but reasonable; and this
no occasion for him to aid the Pope (to the prejudice of the League)
considering that he was the invader, rather than invaded: for the Spaniard well
knew that by declaring for one side he should but give the French occasion to
take the other, and so draw the greater prejudice on his own estates, giving
them the more pretensions to invade him. So that all considered, he was not
unwilling to carry himself only as an arbitrator, and not permit the French to
get the start of him in the management. Yet he suffers the Switzers, which the
Pope had levied for the war, to pass through the State of Milan, as a
counterbalance to the league, and not long after he also granted the same
liberty to other forces of the Duke of Parma's, as a like counterpoise to the
Papalins, which he thought might well consist with his public indifferency:
for otherwise he had a secret grudging against the League; also being his
neighbor Princes, and less potent that had formed an union without his
knowledge, consent, or comprehension; it inwardly* displeasing him that the
Princes of Italy should show to act independently of his Crown; a thought so
much the harder to be digested in that it might be thence gathered that such
resolutions were taken upon a ground of weakness and decay of his greatness,
while in spite of their bad fortune the Spaniards still desired to treat and to
be treated* as when they were at the highest ascendent of their felicity. And
if now a war being broken outit should be again composed without his
arbitration, as umpire of the affairs of Italy, or the French out strip him in
this negotiation, he would be a great deal worse to like it. But I will not
follow these comments any further.

The French were yet more busy and more subtle to handle and wind themselves
into these treaties, so that it is not so easy to penetrate their true
designs, I will therefore be a little more punctual and more large on this
point as a part of my set purpose, for the sake of which I have brought in any
thing of the contrary to illustrate it: nor do I regard any other art or method
then what directly serves the nature of of the things themselves which I am
treating.

Presently after the seizing of Castro, the Marquess of Fontenay is appointed
Ambassador to Rome to accomodate this difference, with order to Cardinal
Bichitill he should come, to apply himself earnestly in this matter to the
Pope and his Nephews, which as a preparative might serve to farther
negotiation. 'Twas about the beginning of November 1641 when Fontenay arrived:
besides the adjusting of the business of Parma, being also encharged to
endeavor the reception of the Bishop of Lamego Ambassador from the new King
of Portugal, Shich the Pope made many excuses to defer, as a point involved
with other interests nothing perfunctory: with it highly concerned the obliging
or disobliging of the two Crowns for the restitution of Castro and other goods
to the Duke of Parma: the Ambassador makes great instances with the Pope,
alleging him to be under his Majesty's protection, with many protestations
that he could not abandon him: but the Pope still insisted on the obedience and
humiliation of Parma to him, as his sovereigne, in his own person, and not by
another's interposall to capitulate with him, he being a Feudatary of the Holy
See; whereupon notwithstanding the Barberini (which had hitherto greatly
countergrained the Spaniards by their partiality to the French) thought it now
time to manage some complyancwith them, and if need were to come over to their
party: in reference whereunto they practice at the Court of Spain by their
Nuntio Facchinetti a conjunction with them to oppress the Duke of Parma, as a
Partisan of the French, and a complotter of designs on the state of Milan, not
omitting at the same time to treat on other conditions to the same drift at the
court of France, and according to the variableness of their designs with the
answerablenesse of either party; so they carried toward the Bishop of Lamego:
but the Spaniards finding (when they had once well settled themselves to hold
the State of Castro, wherein they expected no such opposition as they
afterward met withal) that the former treaties soon cooled; they sought
rather to secure themselves by modelling the intentions of the Duke, pressing
reiterated promises from him, that he would not call the French to his succor,
nor accept of their aids while the Spaniards would support him: but whatsoever
point it was that failed, the best assistance which the Duke had afterward was
by the men and money that came from France. The Marquess of Fontenay's reports
being come to his Master's court, the King of France to second his ambassador
no less then to discover whether in the Pope there were any new inclinations
toward the Spaniards, dispatcheth the Sieur de Lyonne (a young gentleman of an
exquisite capacity, that had also bin bred up by his uncle the secretary de
servient in affairs of great consequence) who coming as an intercessor might
promote in person between the parties those affairs which his Resident
Ambassador could not otherwise treat but by Corriers and so consequently not
without jealousies and delays. De Lyonne presents himself first to the Duke
at Parma while he is busy in Levying of his forces and there delivers his
charge to this purpose, that his Majesty of France continuing his wonted
protection to the person and house of his Highness, had expressly sent him to
the Pope to persuade him to accord, praying his Highness on his part to
facilitate a business so proper for him and so desiderable to France, and so
exhorted him in his King's name to render to the Pope all manner of
Humiliations, which as done to a common Father, would no ways derogate from
the Honor of a Sovereign Prince, and that his so doing would be very
acceptable to his Majesty. The Duke offers any submissions not prejudicial to
his interests, or admitting of such faults as might be of ill consequence to
him and his house hereafter, and with that answer, De Lyonne hasts to Rome
where he presently stopped the publication of the Interdictment intended by the
Barberini, by assuring them, that in such case the Ecclesiastick's were
resolved (Not observing the censures) to hold at their Duke's Devotion, or
otherwise he to employ their revenues in his war, which would have a-amounted
to a great sum (I will insist a little further here, though somewhat below the
times which I intended to resume) Being afterward brought to the feet of his
Holiness, and there rendered the accustomed most humble reverence, he presents
to him the credentiall letter of the King of France written with his own hand,
wherein with most affectionate and efficacious instances, he beseeches him
that qualifying those disgusts that he had conceived against the Duke of Parma,
he would be graciously pleased to restore him to his former good grace; and
embracing him with paternall benevolence, condescend to some agreement to their
reciprocal satisfaction, which courteous expressions being answered by the
Pope in words testifying a very real acceptance; Monsieur de Lyonne proceeds
to a further discourse, importing that it was his Majesty's earnest desire and
request to his Holiness to Restore the Duke of Parma to all his goods and
estates, since he had so amply satisfied his reputation in the conquest of
Castro, and now to forget things past, as his Majesty himself had dealt with
the Duke of Lorrain in restoring him to astate of such advantage upon his
humble submission only to his Majesty's clemency. To this the Pope answered in
these precise terms, Castro is already the Apostolical See's. There is
nothing to be said of that.

If you will treat of Parma and Placentia [which were now pretended to be
forfeited] somewhat may be done at the Kings intercession. About Castro we will
afterward do justice. Monsieur de Lyonne replies, that, that was not the grace
which his Majesty had employed him to seek, it being probable that the
neighbor Princes would not suffer such disaster to befall the Duke of Parma,
nor such an acquisition to a mightier confinant as was the State
Ecclesiastical; where the Pope apprehending a secret conceit shadowed that
the King of France would aid the Parmesan, discovered great alteration, saying
that the Duke of Parma was a rebel and excommunicated, and that whatsoever
Princes should assist him were wicked and Impious, in which case he would put
his trust in God assuring himself that he would not abandon him in his most
righteous cause; That therefore he should not speak any more to him about
Castro, as a business not practicable, but only of Parma, and Placentia:
whereat de Lyonne not troubling himself replied; That if his Holiness would
do any grace to the King, it must be about Castro, for of the other he had no
commission to treat any thing: which more inflaming the Pope's displeasure, he
took his leave in time, that he might reserve his further application for
another audience, which a while after he again obtaining with like success,
took his course back to Parma to propound new overtures. The French having bin
before dealing with the Duke of Parma to draw his assistance toward Lombardy,
were now willing to degage him from any embroilments on the contrary side, or
otherwise to study how to serve themselves upon occasion. The Spaniards though
they longed to revenge the injuries of the Barberini were fain to mortify that
passion with better council, holding it no good time to break with Rome, any
more then to join with Parma. The Republic of Venice, The Duke of Tuscany,
The Duke of Modena (being both allied in blood to Parma) are yet but making
long debates about a league in his favor: Wherefore De Lyonne thinks best to
propound some suspension for the present, fearing least Parma should be
over-powred, which he being a Prince of great Courage, and now if he followed
not his enterprises likely to sink under great charges, which the forces that
he had gathered must needs put him to in his own country, was very unwilling
to hearken to: so that entering with his forces into the ecclesiastical state
he brought great damages and terror to Rome it self, till at last he was
overperswaded to attend the issue of a treaty at Castel-Georgio, wherein the
Papalins to divert the present shock consented to deposite Castro in the Duke
of Modena's hands for three or four months, while affairs in difference should
be treated, The Ministers of France being all this while instant with the State
of Venice, first to mediate for, and then to assist the Duke of Parma,
practicing also at the same time with other Italian Princes on this subject,
cannot avoid jealousies on all sides interchangeable. The Venetians (though
moved thereunto by the French Ministers yet) are very cautious how they
interpose their offices in this affair, least they should seem to deprive that
Crown of the Honor of mediation, whereupon they impart all their negotiations
at Rome with exact diligence to the French Ambassador, passing one concurrence
and correspondence in their treaties: But for the matter of assistance, however
they were inclined to the joining with their Neighbor Potentates to keep Italy
still in the same Balance; yet the instances of the French in this regard they
accounted no way free from suspicion; now especially that the Princes of Savoy
were turned to their service and away thereby opened to the heart of Lombardy:
They hold the old proverb good, Have the French for thy Friend, but not for thy
Neighbor. For although they had the Spaniards ambitious and troublesome
Confinants, which by their moneys and intelligence had made them many chargable
and unseasonable diversions; yet the differences since a whole age had never
come to a breach between them, besides that, they did not count them of so
desultory an humor as other Ultramontans. On another side the Spaniards seeing
the French so busy in their treaties from the one side to the other, and
knowing how much they were obliged to respect them both; now they saw also the
Duke of Parma proceed so prosperously in the state Ecclesiastical without foot
or artillery, began to confirm themselves in a former suspicion, that some
mystery was under those enterprises, and that the Pope was indeed of some
agreement with the Duke of Parma, the King of France and the Princes of the
League, against the Kingdom of Naples, whose Viceroy was allied to That Duke;
which apprehension might have bin the more justified by an overture of Monsieur
De Lyonne (if at least it did not escape the inquisitivenesse of the Spaniards)
made to the Duke of Parma, about the leaving of Castro to Don Tadco, and
accepting of the Pope and King of France his assistance to invest him in the
Kingdom of Naples: To which the Duke roundly answered, Nay, but rather let
them restore me my Duchy, and bestow their Kingdom on Don Tadco. However this
conceit, especially the League being now formed, and his Neighbors in arms
round about him, made the Spaniard keep him on his guard, to his great charges,
and leave those forces on his frontiers of Naples which he needed elsewhere:
being also (as before was intimated) not a little troubled at such a league made
with his exclusion. The Pope and the Barberini are no less satisfied of the
French Negotiations as too too partial to the interests of Parma, and
otherwise suspected to aim only at embroiling all things. The other Princes
are jealous of the Duke of Parma, least he should be brought to cast himself
only on the French assistance, and to bring a formidable guest to their
doors; whereupon they are willing rather to assist him themselves, that he
might enter on no course prejudicial to their common Interests: And so at last
concluding and conjoyning in one league, rendered no less jealousy to the
French themselves then they had done to the others, least it should tend to
contravene their designs now ready against the State of Milan. But let us now
return to the Court, and thence take our license to some other Quarter.

We left the Duke of Orleans a month since shadowed with a dismal, and thick
cloud: but as mighty offices were not wanting to dispell it: particularly of
the Secretary de Chauvigni, a creature of the late Cardinal, and special
Confident of the present. Whereupon on the 12th of January, he arrives at
Paris, and next morning presents himself to the King in his Cabinet, at St
Germans, with one knee on the ground, in expression of reverence, and
humiliation, protesting hereafter never to deviate from that loyalty which on
so many respects he owed to his Majesty: from whom he had this answer. That it
was now high time the effects should agree in perfect harmony with his words:
in which case he might expect the fruits of a loving brotherhood, knowing that
he could not from any other hand, then that of his royal bounty, hope for any
advantage. The King had reason, considering his own health, and the high
interest's of the person, not to leave him in such disgusts, as were likely to
fall heavy on his Infant-successor. But Monsieur to use this grace the more
nobly, disdains not a while after to visit the Duchess of Ayguillon (the
niece of his great adversary of Richelieu, to whose rigidnesse his slips were
imputed) his generosity not allowing him to imitate a vulgar spleen, which
hates for malice, though the obstacle be removed, wrecking it self with
aemulation on all that belong's to the person or his memory.

The arms of France by confederacy with the Swedes, and by joining the troops
of the late Duke of Weimar to the forces of the Count of Guehriant were now
high in Germany, they urging all their power to make the Electour of Saxony,
and these the Electour of Bavaria desist from aiding of the Emperor, and
embrace a neutrality. Wherefore Guebriant to comply with the hardy Swedes (to
whom the rigor of the winter did but seem to facilitate their warfare, in
plaining the passes over rivers, and giving them the nigher access to any
ramparts opposite) abandons his quarters in Franconia to conduct his Army into
the Duchy of Wittemberg, where he harassed all the Country betwixt Hailbrun,
and Ulm, that he might thereby give deeper apprehensions to the Electour of
Bavaria and hold his, and the imperial forces still in distraction, while
General Tortenson accredited with his late victory at Leipsick, was
overrunning of Moravia, and striking terror into Austria. In the mean time
the Baron of Oysonville, that was left in command with the forces of Alsatia,
having somewhat drained Brisach, and Rhin-feld with the other garrisons,
conducts them to Uberlinghens a place situated on the lake of Constance, and
without any great opposition, possesses himself of it, to the great grief of
the Electour of Bavaria, because it flanked on his estates, and no less
jealousy of the Switzers, because their confines were terminated here.
Whereupon they take alarmes, despeede soldiers to their borders, and raise new
works for more security about the fort of Stein, and because the like dangers
were imminent on the County of Burgundy, which on that side also distermined
their country from so powerful a neighbor, they call a diet at Baden, and
thence (notwithstanding the offers of the French, to give them a fair partage
in that Country) they dispatched their Deputies to the Court to make their
humble remonstrances for the indemnity of that province, with protestations of
being bounden to defend it, as an ancient confederate of the Helvetian body, in
case of invasion; which would oblige them most unwillingly to draw their
sword's against those, in whose cause they were ready to brandish them on
another occasion: which offices had made no breach in the King's mind (being
most determined to begin his next campaign, with the attaquing of Salins, that
so intercepting the communication 'twixt Germany and Dola, the whole country
might fall into his power without any further trouble) if his languishing
health had not inclined him to think rather, of the mean's of the general
peace, then of incurring new enemies, whereupon Neutrality was granted to that
Province, paying only some contribution to the Kings troops.

The affairs of Catalonia were yet more importunate with the Court, as indeed
more important; for having lost their old friend, that never failed them in
their need, they began now to doubt of their wonted aids, and upon the sense of
that apprehension to be handled more warily by the French, who first publishing
an Edict through all the principality to declare the constant applications, and
intentions of their crown to uphold the fortunes of those people to the
uttermost, did afterward enjoyne all those, that possessed any feif in
Catalogne, to appear at a time appointed in Barcelona, to swear allegence to
the King of France, in the hands of their Viceroy the Marshall de la Mothe
Houdan court. Which was a grievous Edict to some of the Catalans, that in their
hearts did not wish ill to their old Master, and to others of them, that were
loath to engage so publicly to the King of France, desiring rather, as
neutrall spectators, to follow the air only of that fortune which otherwise
would overwhelme them: But no palliating will serve their turn, the French
Ministers, and the Catalans that sided with them are resolved to know whom to
trust to, and by sequestring the estates of the rest to strengthen their own,
and weaken the Spanish party. Only the Ecclesiastics and especially the
Bishops, whose authority bears high in this Country, were at closer guard to
wave this stroke, pretending conscience, and necessity of a dispensation to be
first obtained from their former oath, given to the Catholicko King, for which
some of them encounter a speedy Chastisement. for the Bishop of Barcelona is
hereupon forced to take his leave, only with fair promises, which afterward
he did not find observed, that he should enjoy the revenues of his Bishopric
in any place by him assigned, which rigor of proceeding against their Prelates
effected no small passion in the people, as was seen a while after more
evidently in expelling the Bishop of Girona, a person counted of great
worthiness in his Charge; with whom when the Viceroy, and the royal Ministers
could avail nothing they send the Count of Argenc'on, and Don Joseph
Margarita, one of the principal in the late revolutions, to the Pope's
Collectour General, who in his name was resident in that principality, to
receive the revenues of vacant Bishoprics, as is also used in all the other
Kingdoms of Spain, to acquaint him what matter of just suspicion they had
against the Bishop, and that they came by order from the Viceroy to
communicate thus much to him, as an Apostolical Minister: that he might advise
at Rome of the merits of their procedure, the need which they had of security
and the necessity, which the foresaid Bishop had brought upon himself, that so
their action's might be charactered by their respect, and zeal to the Holy
See. The Collectour answered (thanking the Viceroy for this office) that he
should advise his Holiness punctually about it, in the mean while letting him
know, that notwithstanding the necessity by them supposed, they should consider
the regard and reverence due to the Episcopal dignity, being subject to no
other then the Pope; That therefore they should abstain from any umbrage of
violence, setting before them the dreadful censures which which they might
incur thereupon. The Governor Margarita answered with an oath not to offend
his own conscience, nor his reputation, and so with a great company takes his
way to Blanes, a Sea town in the province of Gironne, where the Bishop then
sojourned. At first he showed his Commissions to the Bishop with a studied
discourse, bidding him departure in discreet terms, yet intimating necessity.
But when the Bishop made answer smiling, and called for a Notary to make a
public act of the violence done him, the Governor somewhat altered, commands
him to depart in rounder terms, limiting a few hours to the execution, which he
stood in a Balcone not far off to see effected. But the Bishop goes
immediately to celebrate Mass, and after takes his leave of the people with
such Eloquence, and in term's so compassionable, as drew his Auditors to flow
in tears after him to the sea shore, lamenting his departure, and blaming the
rigidnesse of the Governor, which was also the longer thought on, because his
brother a Dominican Friar was appointed to receive the revenues of that Church,
and shortly after made Bishop of it by the King of France.

The Catalonians in another case showed not only disgust, but suspicion: for
when the French were treating with them of raising a Fortroyall on a hill,
which stood too near to prejudice their city of Barcelona, persuading them to
demolish their imperfect fortifications, which being built without art might
serve, it may be, to offend more then to defend them, and in pursuance of these
counsels brought an Engineer to design the form of it: they endeavored not
only to throw Jealousy on this action, but openly showed so resolute a
repugnancy, as obliged the Kings Ministers to surcease in it. And the
Magistrates of Barcelona levelled the old works, leaving only an ancient tower
which served for a Pharos on the Seaside.

Meanwhile the Spaniards employ such forces as they had under the banner of the
Marquess of Inoijosa about five thousand foot, and five hundred horse to take
up their quarters within the territory of the Castle of Amposta, and that with
such success, that they were like to recover all that tract lying between the
Eber, and Arragon. From thence he accosteth the a place belonging to the
Jurisdiction of Barcellona, but a sudden rising of the waters obliges him to
dislodge, bringing great damage upon the country, whereupon he turns his course
to Mirave, and enters that town with a thousand horse and an hundred foot,
planting his batteries against the Castle which he had brought almost to
terms, when the Marshall de la Mothe on a sudden passes the Eber, and arrives
with a strong brigade to their succor, enters the place without dispute, and
finds means to cast in a recruit of eight hundred men, which not at all
delaying to sally out on their Assaylers, while the Marshall invested them on
all sides there ensued an hardy conflict for about three hours, but at last
the Castilians, were fain to leave the field to their enemies, with the death
of some hundreds, and prise of four hundred more. But the loss of the French
was so considerable, that it imbittered the victory. The Marquess of Inoijosa
being then at Gandesa, soliciting Cannon, and provisions (not suspecting that
La Mothe could pass the river so soon, which he had left so high and
impetuous between them) did not come to aid his men with the rest of his his
forces. On this success the French over-runne the country to Tortosa and then
leaving Flix, and Miravet well provided return with the rest, and their
prisoners in a way of triumph to Barcellona, where the Vic^roy was thought to
use a French liberty too much in standing to view them with Donna Eusalia, a
beautiful Lady, and wife of a Catalan Gentleman from a balconie in his house.

This fate of Inoijosa was sadly resented in Spain, fearing lest the residue of
their forces should scarce suffice to hinder excursions into Arragon and
Valentia, so that, that King was fain to call two thousand Italians and Germans
to these parts, which had been sent to the frontiers of Portugal: Nor was
this piece of service, though in it self of no great consequence, any less
applauded at the court of France, especially by the Secretary de Noyers to whom
the Marshall was allied: so that not omitting such an opportunity, he never
left recommending La Mothe's services, till he got the King to grant him the
investiture of the Duchy of Cardona, which is one of the fairest and amplest
domains in Catalogne, and had formerly been denied him, as a bounty exceeding
his merits and condition, he being advanced from a mean estate, and of the
house of an ordinary Gentleman. The Catalans did inwardly ramaricate this
largess to a stranger, when so many of their own Nobility were ruined by
following of the party, yet accommodating themselves to the time, showed
outwardly to gratulate that favor done to their Viceroy, as intended to
themselves.

The Spaniards in Flanders began now to be sensible of a critical time
ascending over France, and of changes likely to be incident, whereupon they are
the earlier this year in their preventions, hovering about the frontiers of
Picardy, with their squadrons, to be ready either to foment, or make some
Impression as occasion served. The Duke of Enguien (now Prince of Conde) had
been appointed General for the French in these parts, at the issuing of the
next Campaign the Marshall de l' Hospital being declared his
Lieutenant-Generall, and the Marquess of Geures, Gassion, d' Aumont, and la
Ferte-seneterre his Mareschal's of Camp, but in the mean time the Count of
Guicke (now Marreschal de Grammont) is sent to wait upon their motions where we
leave him at the present, and take our tour back into Italy, (A stage of

The French having made themselves Master's of Tortona, employ their studies
how to preserve it, and make their way to further acquists. In suit whereof
they make a Donative of the Tortonese to Prince Thomas of Savoy as a
principality, and he freely offers it to the Duke of Parma, as a place fit for
him (bordering upon his estates) to receive the aids of France upon occasion,
and shoulder out the Spaniards from re-entring, and make himself amends by
some other acquisition according to the orders of his Majesty of France; for it
was commonly believed that by private articles between that crown, and the
house of Savoy it was agreed that the Prince Thomas should possess in
soverainty whatever he should gain in the Milanese, by the joint arms of the
French and Saovoyrds; as a way not only to encourage him, but also to remove
Jealousies from the Princes of Italy about the designs of that King, which how
far it may be veritable, we may guess farther by the negotiations of the
French Minister's at Venice, and in particular of Monsieur de Lyonne coming to
give account of the breach of the treaty at Castel-Georgio, and of the little
syncerity of the Ecclesiastics in those proceedings: whereupon he took
occasion to move them farther to unite their forces and councels with those of
France, for the total expulsion of the Spaniards from the Duchy of Milan,
with protestation that the most Christian Crown, to take away all jealousies
from the Princes of Italy, contenting it self with the only glory, and
advantage to have beaten their enemies in all places, would not appropriate to
it self one foot of land: but would either invest some Italian Prince in it to
their common satisfaction, or divide it among such Princes of the same
province, as should partake in the travail of the enterprise. That it would be
no hard matter for the powerful arms of France on the one side, and those of
that Republic on the other, to strike into the heart of that Duchy; upon
which resolution his Majesty to show his most disinteressed good will to the
Italian Princes, his accomplices herein, would freely engage not only to take his
garrison out of Casale, but also to abandon Pignerol, not retaining any thing on
that side of the mountains. And that they might the better secure themselves of
his Majesty's royal purposes, he offered to leave the entire management and
direction of this business to the Republic, and that the King would concur
in such manner, as best might comport with the liking of the Princes of Italy,
whether by a limited number of soldiers, or by sea forces, or by powerful
diversions, or by aids of money only, which agreement howsoever desirable to the
King of France, if notwithstanding it should not succeed, his Majesty was most
determined to make this invasion by himself (that Republic only guarding its
professed neutrality) and there to repay himselfd for his own travells as well
as he could, not admitting afterward of any conjunction on the same terms now
proffered.

These overtures of the King of France assailed the minds of the Senators with
various agitations, They knew how much themselves and all Italy had enjoyed a
calm by the indifferency of their counsels, and although the Spaniard had
been somewhat a sullen Neighbor: yet they could not set themselves to expel
him, without bringing a deluge of blood and confusion over Italy, since the
house of Austria would hazard all to their patrimoniall States, before they
would permit so noble an estate to be dismembered from them: nor was it
forgotten how deceitful an ambition it proved to this Republic, when they
joined with Lewis the 12th of France, to the extreme hazard of themselves,
and of the liberty of Italy: which things might well teach them to adhere to
their ancient Maxim, to beware of hardy counsels, and hold themselves only to
temperate resolutions: Besides that the violent and moody designs of the
French proved for the most part fatal to the Italians that joined with them:
whereof the Republic had a fresh example of this very Kings; to second whose
Impressions after he had taken the pass of Sura, and advanced to raise the
siege of Casale, then distressed by the Spaniards, they had entered with an Army
into the Cremonese according to agreement, and on a sudden found themselves
abandoned to make their own conditions with the Spaniards, the King leaving
Italy in have to go stifle the last insurrection of the Hugnenots in Languedoc.
In fine they held it for their best security that the two crowns should be
aequiballanced.

The Venetians being thus resolved give an answer most expressive of their
affectionate disposition, and wellwilling toward the interests of France, of
their ancient observance and devotion to that Crown, of their common ends and
counsels, and of their own propension to quietness, with many other fair
words, which did not exceed the general terms of obsequious complementing.
Notwithstanding the Republic was not free of much anxiety about their answer,
knowing that great Monarchs will not be paid with empty words, and that the
King being resolute to pass into Italy, they might be like to incur some
hazard of his amity, if they held themselves precisely to the terms of their
neutrality. But alterations being now like to happen in France, they resolved
to attend the issues which longer time might produce.

We are to leave our silken furniture here: The Trumpet and the Cannon call us
to the other side of the Apennines to the tents there pitched, in spite of
winter, about the avenues of Tortona.

The Count of Sirvela, Governor of Milan having much lost his reputation at
the Court of Madrid by loosing of Tortona, dispatches a Gentleman of quality
thither to make his excuses: and then applies himself with great instances to
the Viceroy of Naples for recruits of men and moneys, at the same time
pressing the Milanese to do their utmost efforts on such an occasion as this
was, to show their Loyalty to his Majesty of Spain. Prince Thomas of Savoy, the
New General of the French forces in Italy was no less sensible on the other
side, of the great importance of this Place, to signalize his further services
if he could but keep it till the next Campaign; and therefore sollicites the
Court of France with equal fervency to hasten a supply to him of 3000 foot and
1000 Horse, with which he might not only hold the Town, but the Adjacent
Country in subjection: but affairs there (as before was intimated) not having
yet found a current Channel, foreslowed those recruits so long that the
Spaniards were ready before him.

The Governor of Milan provides first to block the town at large, and then
draws with all his forces toward Casale (a jealous piece both to French and
Savoyard) to make them hold their strength there, and not to send them to
Tortona, which done, He sends a party to wast Montferrat, and all the Country
that was to lie in the Frenches way, if they thought of relieving the Town to
be invested. Then, bringing all his Army on the 8 of February before the place,
He planted his Batteries in such manner, that at 20 shots with two pieces of
Cannon, and within 24 hours he opened a breach, forcing the French with the
best goods in the City, to retire into the Castle and Convent of St Dominico,
which they had strongly fortified; and this gave the Spaniards convenience to
form their siege, and draw their Line (though opposed by vigorous Sallies)
entrenching themselves so strongly in their Works, that when they were
accomplished, and afterward considered by the Marshall du Plesis Praslin, and
the Marquess of Ville (the one Chief Commander for the French, and the other
for the Savoyards under the Princes Orders) they commended them for the most
secure, and admirable that ever they had seen.

This Poyanant news being come to the Prince, speedily ramasseth his Troops,
crosses the Po, ravages the Navarresse, making show of an hardy Enterprise on
some other place; but finding all passes strongly guarded, and don Vincenzo
Gonzago, and the Marquess of Taracena with strong parties dispatched to wait
upon His motions, so that, that way would be like to bring him into great
difficulties, He retired between the Gogno, and the Sesia (2 small Rivers) as a
secure place, to stay for 2000 Foot that were already embarked at Oneglia to
recruit Him* and then re-attempted many ways to pursue His purpose of
relieving the City: but found all the Fords, and Wharfes of the Rivers so
strickly kept, that he was fain to beat the same way back into Montferrat;
where coasting up and down, to amuse the Spaniards of his intentions, and elude
their diligence; on a sudden He passes the River Tanaro without opposition,
and so accosting the City of Asti by a round, and quick assault given on an
imperfect Fort, situate between the town, and the River, he gained the City
also, and shortly after the Cittadell.

The Governor of Milan was at hand (having left a body of 3000 men to
prosecute the siege at Tortona) to have relieved this place: but being
intercepted by the River, that he could not apply his aid so speedily as was
requisite he sends the Marquess of Caracena into Montferrat, to revenge
himself on the Savoyards by attempting Aicqui; where the Citizens made
resistance till they had secured the best of their goods in the Castle, and
then compounded at 2000 Doubles for the City to save it from sacking. Mean
while Prince Thomas makes a Tour, and sees himself ere long, within the sight
of Tortona. The Governor, as soon as he found his March recalls all his forces
to the siege, some 16000 men effective, besides a Nerve of Cavalry, with which
the Marquess of Caracena was left to guard the Posts of the River Scrivia:
Prince Thomas having seized some little hills behind the Spanish Trenches,
resolves to attaque their lines: but a Council of War being called (after a
slight skirmish, whereby their damage sufficiently showed the difficulty of
their attempt, and the impenetrablenesse of the Lines, together with the
impossibility of staying there for want of forage) they planted a piece of
Cannon, whereby (as had bin done formerly at the siege of Turin) they conveyed
Letters into the Castle to Monsieur de Forenville the Governor, advising him,
when he could no longer hold out, to capitulate, and He by the same means
answering, advised them of his extremity, having now maintained himself 4
Months; whereupon, the delivery of the Castle upon honorable Terms ensued
shortly after; The French going out with 4 Pieces of Cannon, which they had
brought in, and were convoyed by the Spaniards to the head of the Princes Army,
and treated so courteously by them in the way, that on the other side of the
River Scrivia, they had provided a refreshment for them of 50 Barrells of Wine,
with Bread, and Cheese. The Town being thus regained, both parties seemed to
admit a tacit truce, and went to refresh their soldiers with better Quarters.
I must also serve the occasion, and return to the spiny subject that before I
was handling.

Monsieur de Lyonne finding himself much aggrieved at the non-suiting of the
treaty of Castel-Georgio, which had snap't the Line of the Duke of Parma's
progress, giving respite to the Ecclesiastiques (though the Barberini
pretending that his Arms had not rested thereupon, as was engaged, took
occasion, not only to break in, but to recriminate the more exquisitely) came
to Rome with high complaints to the Marquess of Fontenay Ambassador Lieger
there, giving out, that he would treat no more in the negotiation; but
notwithstanding intermitt's it not: Only the Marquess, casting this Manleon
his other disgusts, retires from Rome to Caprarola, a place not far distant
belonging to the Estates of the Duke of Parma. His other pretenses were the
non-admission of the Bishop of Lamego, as had bin promised, and the not
confirming of an Election made at a Chapter General in Genova of Father
Mazzarino (the Brother of the Cardinal) to be General of the Friar
Dominicans; Which grounds (being judged insufficient for such a dereliction)
gave jealousy at Rome of some mysterious Object in the eye of France: But when
the dispatches of Fontenay came to the Court with account of his departure out
of Rome and the motives of it, the King send's for the Nuntio, and with much
efficacy complain's of the Pope's proceedings in the breach of the Treaty of
Castel-Georgio and deluding of his Ministers there, annulling the Election of
Father Mazzarino, of the partiality of Cardinal Barberino to the Spaniards,
with the injuries he had done his Royal person, and interposition, whereupon
he counted himself engaged in his reputation to use all means to bring that
treaty to effect. The Nuntio set himself to excuse the Actions of Rome,
beseeching the King to suspend his judgment about the reasons of his
Ambassadors departure, of which he confessed that yet he had had no notice;
but hoped in a short time to be acquainted of particulars; in the mean while
that he could not admit of any ill judgment about his Holinesse's good
intentions. Notwithstanding, his Majesty much resented this act of his
Ambassador without orders; and as earnestly desired his return to the court;
so it might be without blemish to his reputation. The Ambassador of Venice
coming not long after to an audience, and being advertised of these
dissatisfactions, thought it a fit time for the credit of his State to make
proffer of their offices to bring the Marquess of Fontenay back with honor,
which he doubted not, but his Republic would endeavor by all the fair means
possible. The King hearkened to this overture, entreating him to write
effectually to that purpose. The Nuntio being also advised hereof by the
Ambassador, promised to solicit at the Court of Rome, that the good offices
of the Commonwealth on this behalf might be accepted.

But however, this forwardness of their Ambassador, was not liked so well at
Venice, till the issue it self approved it: for at this time they themselves
were at no good Terms at Rome, in being a part of the league against the
Barberini, though still they continued their Ministers of state there.

The Spaniards seeing the French Ambassador gone from his Residence, thought it
now a time for them to interpose more vigorously to inflame these disgusts, and
to form an union of the Princes of Italy to their Crown, as the only way to
effect the depositing of Castro in the hands of the League, and exclude the
French (which were now become jealous to them, lest they should get that
depositing into their own hands) from interesting themselves any further in
this Mediation, the honor whereof they desired to carry from them: to this
purpose they sought how to bring themselves and the Pope within the League, so
modelling the design of it, that they might get the chief arbitration both of
the difference, and deposition, propounding that Castro might be put into the
hands of the Duke of Savelli, the Emperors Ambassador at Rome, till the
treaty might be brought to an issue: but the Pope and the ligued Princes were
too sensible to be drawn by any other motives than those of their proper
Interests* and the sudden recalling to Rome of the Marquess of Fontenay by
the intercessions of the offices of Venice, set on foot new practices, and put
a new luster on them, by the graciousnesse that ensued on a kind of
reconcilement, between his Holiness, and the most Christian King, which was
accompanied with the satisfaction of the Father Mazzarino, in being made Master
of the Sacred Palace, a thing that sweetened all imbitterings; for it was
thought that the cause of this Father, was the very motive (how ever palliated)
that made the Ambassador show so high resentment, to the end that he might
thereby ingratiate the Cardinal his Brother, a matter which yet proved a
scandal to the Cardinal in France, that the pretentions of his Brother should
hazard the interests of the State, and the amity of the Pope, which also gave
him displeasure at them both, using his utmost prudence to recompose those
differences.

Our story begin's now to prey upon the last wiek, the Oil of the Kings life
is 'ee'n exhausted, the vanishing Flame having long wavered about the brims:
But his declining makes the several Ministers gather as much authority as they
could within the folds of their respective Robes, whereby they could not miss
of some such Rent, as put Hortensius to a suit in Law, when they encountered one
another in passages too strait for them. The Parliament is jealous of the
Ministers of State, and these of the Princes of the Blood, since they saw the
Queen, the Duke of Orleans, and the Prince of Conde close together, and likely
to bear before them the entire management of affairs, which in all probability
would ruin the Creatures and dependences of the late RICHELIEU, that held
themselves yet at the height of their Fortune in the King's favor. And these
apprehensions wrought so intemperately with the Secretary de Noyers that at
last it procured his dismission: For the King, now employing his best
thought's, and advise with his Councillors about the framing of His Will, and
leaving a sure estate to His Infant-Heir* Monsieur de Noyers was in many points
of a different opinion from the others, pretending to regulate too much with
His Conceits (whether by his proper inclination, or adhering to the Maxims of
the late Cardinal, whose great Confident he h^d bin) especially in the great
business of excluding the Duke of Orleans from the Government, and nominating
the Persons of the Council: This rendered his employment the less desirable
to the other States-Masters, which still applied themselves to clear his
Majesty of prejudices conceived against the said Duke, and of the ill
consequence that was likely to ensue upon any division of the Royal house. Nor
did it a little contribute to the laying aside of this Instrument, that he was
so zealous against the Protestants, ever traversing the aids of Germany, which
the Cardinal Mazzarini procured with great Ardour; as a most important
interest of the Crown; discovering also the like averseness to the Huguenots,
insomuch that it was reported he should one day tell the Marshall de
Chastillon that when he was to sign any thing in favor of his Sect, it seemed
to him as if he were to gash his own hand: But above all, His importunacy with
the King was the greatest maturer of his downfall, he taking upon him to use
(as his Master Richelieu had done) and in case he found not that Countenance
which he desired, to demand retirement; a thing which the other would do with
great art, knowing the necessity which the King had of his Services: But of
Noyers his ill success in this way, we may see at one instance how he came to
knock off from his attendance. He had the office of Receiver General of the
rate of Subsistence (an Imposition laid at first, with exemption of the payers
from quartering of Soldiers; but since made as the other ordinary Tallies) of
which he disposed at his own discretion, making no account to any other: It
came to the King's ear, that this Subsistence, the year before, was ill
dispensed, and only to the friends, and kindred of the Foresaid Noyers:
whereupon the King take's occasion to ask him on what he had expended those
sums, which passed through his hands for the service of the War, and of which
he used to render no Account. ( It Is a certain Revenge on our own ill humor to
think amiss of Him, that we depend on; or entertain any Umbrage that he
dislikes us, or is mistaken in our good intentions, for commonly such a passion
is apt to fennow, and so to mantle in its sowernesse, that one cannot afterward
restore it to that Object.) Noyers, who had either made, or phancied the King's
Countenance to be not so good as usually toward Him, took this word for a
sign of diffidence, and so answered that he had ready in his Cabinet, a Book
of all Expenses made by him; and then let himself lavish in expressions; that
since his hard fortune did now render him suspected, after a service of so many
years uninteressed, 'twere better that his Majesty would permit him to render
his charge to some other, that might be more fortunate; since, neither could a
Prince satisfy himself in a Servant whom he distrusted; nor such a Servant
enjoy any quiet, that knew his integrity to be doubted of. (It Was thought that
Noyers was the more bold in venting this Passion, presuming that his two
Confidents, as he presumed, the Cardinal Mazzarini, and the Secretary de
Chauvigny would sufficiently secure Him from having this request easily
granted, but) his Majesty hereupon discovered such displeasure, that Monsieur
de Chauvigny first withdrew him handsomely from the King's bed, and then from
his Chamber, persuading him to consider, and not to precipitate with himself,
but give way to his Majesty's anger for the time; which some interpreted as
the act of a true Friend, but others as the Ruse of a Courtier to draw him from
the King, and so from all hope of accommodation: for some make a great question
whether the buds of Noyers his disfavour, were not cultivated by the two other
Ministers of State, Mazzarini, and Chauvigni, because they were the dependants
of these two that most incensed the King against Him; and immediately after his
decession his Charge was conferred by the Cardinall's instance, on Monsteur de
Tellier then in Piemont, ^as Auditor General of the Army; besides that it was
many ways evident, that the Cardinall's designs did not meet in Noyers of a
fit Instrument, and that he had at several times treated with the King, of
such matters, as de Noyers would have possessed him with the Contrary. Which
things if real (as they have a great show of truth) one would think, by de
Noyers's proceedings, that his desires also were no less real then pretended
to retire to his privacy: He goe's to Chauvigny, desire's his opinion as his
friend, whether he should demand his License in person of the King, or by
another: who after many fair offices to persuade with him, at last advise's him
to serve himself of the assistance of the Cardinal, to avoid disgusting of
the King any further. De Noyers meets the Cardinal in the Louvre, demand's
this grace of him publicly, and with a kind of Pomp, that the world might
take notice of it, as a generous, free action of his own, and accordingly the
Cardinal does the office, after some excuses, with more show then reality; at
his return bringing him that dismission which he desired, and received with
demonstrations of the cordiallest alacrity. This fall of Noyers was only
grievous to the Marshall de Mesteraye, who being much interessed in his
preservation, addresseth himself a new to the Cardinal to have this business
put upon the file again; whom the Cardinal answering, that he resented this
act of Monsieur de Nayens as much as any other, and had omitted no office to
divert him from the course that he had taken.

The Marshall suffered himself to be so far transported with his passion,
as to tell him, That he did not understand these finesses of Italy, proceeding
frankly and in the French fashion: The Cardinal notwithstanding continued in
his excuses, treating him with acts of more respect, so that both seemed to
part with satisfaction. From hence the Marshall takes his way to de Noyers
then at Pontoise, to treat with him, and finds him most determined to
acquiesce, desiring the Mareschall to let his Majesty know, that he took it
for an infinite obligation that his Majesty had been pleased to dispense with
his retirement. Which carriage of his was accounted more to commend his
courage, then his courtship, considering especially that the King's death was
by all tokens near at hand, which would have broke up those clouds that then
overshadowed him.

April 17. The King's malady being intermissive had hitherto observed some
uncertain periods, allowing him his lucida inter^^lla to treat and give orders
about affairs* but now betraying worser symptoms, the physicians advise the
Statesmen of their opinion, that it was to terminate ere long in death.
Whereupon the Prince of Conde, and Cardinal Mazzarini consult together how to
give his Majesty admonition, and so present themselves to him in his chamber,
telling him, that although the Physicians did not despair of his Majesty's
recovery; yet since he found his health continually declining, and running some
hazard of a sad event; that the glory of his Majesty, the good of the Princes
his children, and of the whole State seemed to require, that as his Majesty
had hitherto established his greatness, and augmented the splendour of his
crown, so now he should consider of leaving his affairs in such order, that no
emergent might alter them for the future. That the Spaniards had not refused a
suspension of arms, before so earnestly desired by them, on any other ground,
then a certain misprision which they had conceived of the troubles of France
likely to ensue on the failing of his Majesty, and therefore that the true way
to undeceive them was to make it evident, that whatsoever event should happen
his Majesty's will should stand for a sure and inviolable Law for the
Government of his Kingdom.

The King accepted not only of their discourse, but affectionately thanked
them, and then desired to hear the Prince's judgment about the disposal of
the Government. Who thereupon took occasion to extol highly the wisdom and
goodness of the Queen, and after set himself to excuse the Duke of Orleans,
ascribing his escapes to the over-rigid treatments of the late Cardinal,
showing that these two persons as the chief of the kingdom, ought by
consequence to have the principal part in so important an administration.

The King having well learned by his own experience how subject France is to
alterations in the times of Minority, was the more desirous to leave a state
well settled, wherein neither the Queen nor the Duke of Orleans (whom he did not
eye so well) should invelope the whole authority in their own persons, which he
devised to distribute among several Councillors, and to give them the
Cardinal Mazzarini for their Principal, much after the manner of the
Government of Sweden, with the superintendency of the grand Chancellor
Oxenstern: which thoughts when he had discovered to the Cardinal, he found not
such approbation as he desired, but rather met with strong arguments,
persuading him to observe the ancient usances of the Crown. But after all
deliberations the King at last resolved to form a Council, according to the
tenor of a declaration which he sent forthwith to the Queen, by the hand of
Monsieur de Chauvigny* the prime secretary of State, that she might see it,
and signify her desire about any change in it for her better satisfaction,
that so being afterward approved by the Parliament, it might be to pass as a
Salick Law among the people; which last words touched to the quick, though at
that time the Queen dissembled them with discretion, and presently passed to
the King's chamber to render thanks, and to condole with him, till both melted
into tears with expressions of love and tenderness. Next morning the Cardinal
Mazzarini comes to Paris to give account of the King's resolutions to the Duke
of Orleans, with intimation to the Parliament, Princes, Dukes, Peers, and
officers of the Crown, to present themselves to his Majesty at S. Germans,
where a fit time being waited, till the Kings malady was somewhat alleviated,
they were all called into his Chamber, where the Queen and her two Sons stayed
for them; and then his Majesty* speaking all the while uncovered, made a
passionate speech unto them, accompanied with such carriages as pressed tears
from the bystanders. After which the Secretary de la Urilliere read the
declaration of his Majesty's last will, which was to this effect:

That although it had pleased God to bestow admirable successes on him through
the whole course of his reign; yet now in the middle of his prosperities, he
had also put him in mind of his frailty by a languishing disease, whereof
howsoever there were good hope of his recovering, notwithstanding because the
judgments of men most experienced are fallible in these cases, he thought
himself obliged to provide for the peace of his Kingdom, when he was gone.
That he judged the best way to obtain this end, and to disappoint the projects
of the enemies of France, to be the uniting of all the royal family with one
Spirit to maintain the present state of his Crown; which would be also a great
tie to his confederates to adhere to the interesses of France, when they shall
find it governed by the same maxims that had hitherto upheld its grandeur. To
execute which designs he thought no course more expedient, then that which the
King's his predecessors had taken on the like occasions, who judged that the
regency of the Kingdom, and education of the minor Kings could not be better
placed, then on the persons of their Queen Mothers; and therefore that he did
ordain, that in case his death should ensue before the Dauphin should enter on
the fourteenth year of his age, or in case that the Dauphin should die before
the Majority of his second Son the Duke of Anjou, his dearest spouse and
consort the Queen Mother of his foresaid children should be Regent of France,
and have the education of them during their minority, together with the
administration of the government of the Kingdom, during his nonage that should
be King, with the advice of her council in manner hereafter following. And in
case the said Queen after his death, and during her Regency should be in danger
of finishing her days, he ordained that she should provide with the advice of
her Council herein specified, for the Regency and government for the time. And
to testify to his dear and beloved Brother the Duke of Orleans, that nothing
has been able to diminish the Love that he has ever borne him, he ordained
him Lieutenant General of the non-aged King, and to exercise the said charge
in all the provinces in the Kingdom under the authority of the Queen Regent
and of the Council; and this notwithstanding the declaration registered against
him in the Court of Parliament: only declaring that if he in any wise shall
contravene this establishment, he remain ipso facto deprived of this charge.
That although from the wisdom, piety and virtue of the Queen he might well
promise himself a happy government of his state* yet considering the weight of
such a charge, and the impossibility of her taking cognizance of all affairs
necessary, that he thought fit to establish a council of the Regency to assist
her, by whose judgments and authority the great and weighty affairs of State
should be examined and resolved by plurality of Voices: to compose which
Council, he thought he could not make better election for Ministers of State,
then of his dear and beloved Cosins, the Prince of Conde, and the Cardinal
Mazzarini, of his trusty and well beloved the Lord de Seguier Chancellor of
France, and keeper of the seals, the Lord de Bouttiglier Surintendant of his
finances, and the Lord de Chauvigni Secretary of State, and of his
Commandments.

He ordained also that the Duke of Orleans, and in his absence the Prince of
Conde, or Cardinal Mazzarini should be chief of the Council, and if any
place should become void, that the Queen should supply it by advise of the
Council and all other important charges of the Kingdom to be so disposed by
plurality of votes. Only for all Ecclesiastical preferments, which belonged to
his nomination, he left the providing for their supply to the Queen and the
Cardinal Mazzarini, of whose worthy discharging this trust he had good reason
to rest most assured by the eminent proofs which he had had of the
faithfulness and great sufficiency of the person. In fine: he ordained that
the Queen and the Duke of Orleans should swear in the presence of him, and of
the Princes of the Blood, with the other Princes, Dukes, Peers, Mareschals of
France, and Officers of the Crown to keep and observe the Contents of the
present declaration without any manner of Contravention. Which was accordingly
subscribed and sworn at the same instant by the Queen, and Duke of Orleans,
and sealed before the rest, and accordingly next day ratified in the Parliament
in presence of the Duke of Orleans, the Prince of Conde and the other Princes
and Officers. Given at S. Germans in the month of April. 1643. and of his reign
the 33.

Which declaration being read, the King gave free liberty to all the exiles of
the Court or State, against whom no Sentence had been given, to make their
return, and commanded corriers to be sent to some more remote, that they might
have timely notice, and his Majesty had content before his death to receive the
Duke of Vendosma, the Mareschaux de Bassompierre and d' Estree, and diverse
others into his grace. If a man might be politic before the proof of events,
this act of State might be a subject of strange descantings: but if we can
content our selves with such conjectures as best please us, till the Regency
begin to take place, we may better guess at the true interests of the parties
concerned by this deed, and of the true interest of the Crown. His majesty
having now freed his thoughts of this care, took pleasure to order a private
ceremony in the chapel of S. Germans, appointing the baptism of the D^uphin
by the name of Lovis, and the Princes of Conde with the Cardinal Mazzarini (on
whom the King would confer this honor (as he himself said) to oblige him
the more straightly to serve the King and the Crown) to present him to the
font, that so with the powerful cords of interest he might, as much as in him
lay, twist an artificial kind of nature, making him the Compater, or
Spiritual Father of that Prince, in the forming of whose youth he might now
seem to claim a privilege with the Queen. To both which, and to all his other
officers and nobles having so effectually recommended his State and childrem,
what more could remain to such a Prince, but to die in the arms of that Honor
that had ever lived with him, and to deserve those characters, in which a
terser pen then mine has designed him? And so I leave him in the way to his
funeral pomp, which a while after followed with great Solemnity.
