THat the Honorable House of Commons were pleased in August 1646. to order
that the sum of five thousand pounds should be raised by the said County for
disbanding of the Derby shire forces, which said moneys were to be repaid out
of the Compositions of Delinquents estates in the said County; That 3981 l.
10s. part of the said 5000 l. was repaid according to the said order to Sir
John Curson and Sir John Cook by the Treasurers at Goldsmiths Hall, and the
remaining sum being 1018. 10 s. transferred to be paid out of Deans and
Chapters Lands, But afterward in September 1650. It was ordered that the said
1018 l. 10 s. should be paid out of Delinquents estates which shall be sold.

Now because the petitioners are many of them very poor men, and have been long
out of their moneys and are not able to subsist without present payment
thereof, having been at great charge, and spent much money in attending to get
satisfaction of the moneys remaining due to them, and which was advanced by the
order and for the service of the Parliament, and for which many of them have
paid interest ever since the borrowing thereof.

They humbly pray your Honors to commiserate their sad Condition, and that you
will be pleased to give order that payment of the said sum of 1018 l. 10 s. may
be made unto them by some of your Treasurers for Delinquents estates for
Compositions.

And they shall pray etc.
