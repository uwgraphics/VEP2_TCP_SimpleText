VERSES On the Siege of Gloucester, and Col. Massey.
SO stands a Rock (rooted within the main)
In spite of Tempests, whilst the waves in vain
In curled heaps, which on his bosom beat,
Fall back in foame, and make a faint retreat:
As Gloucester stood against the numerous powers
Of the Besiegers, who with Thunder-showers
Charged her old ribs, but vanished like a storm
With their own loss, and did no more perform
Then Squibs cast in the air, which throw about
Some furious sparks, and so in smoke go out:
'Twas not her Trenches which their force withstood,
Nor River purpled with Malignant blood,
Canon, nor Bulwarks raised with Martial art,
That did secure her, but great Masseys heart,
That was the Fort, no Engyne could beat down,
Nor Mine blow up, more strong then was the Town,
Impregnable as a Rock, they sooner might
Plunder the Fire of heat, the Sun of light,
Then him of virtue; neither could reward
Nor battery of Court-Honours break his Guard,
Nor promises nor threats an entrance got,
But did return as fruitless as their shot;
And when the fuel for Defense was wasted,
Even to the last extremes his valor lasted.
For formidable Essex, from a far
Upon the Mountains (like a Blazing-star)
Appears to the Malignants, and portends
Ruin and Death: but his distressed Friends
With animating vigor he inspires,
And warns at distance by auspitious fires,
As when the Sun with his ascent does clear
The Winter Tempests, and recrute the year:
It Is said, The Satyr fled from man aghast,
When he perceived his breath with the same blast
To cool and heat; had here that Satyr been,
He might from flames the like effects have seen.
These courage got, and those their courage lost,
And what to these gave heat, to those was frost;
'Stead of Grenades, Curses now they dart,
With vollies of God-dammees, and so part.
Gloucester is freed, her Being and her Name,
Made Monuments (Brave Massey) to thy Fame;
Her Temples and her Pyramids now turn
Thy Trophies, which were like to be thy Urne,
Whilst we dispute, which to ascribe to thee,
An active or a passive Victory;
And are in doubt in which thou were most brave,
When thou did thousands kill, or thousands save.
Printed according to Order.
