THESE are to give Notice; That ISAAC THOMPSON (His Majesty's Sworn
Engine-Maker) has found out a way, with a Brass Elbow and Joint, to fasten a
Leather Pipe upon any Common or Church Engine, which (in case of Fire) shall
not only carry the Water as high and as far to the Front of a House, as with
the Brass Pipe formerly upon the Engine; but also may be carried into any
House, Yard or Alley, as well and in all respects as any other Engine.

He also makes all sorts of Pumps for private Houses, for Mines or deep Wells:
and Pumps proper and useful for Ships of all Rates; as likewise for emptying
Ponds or draining low Grounds; Engines to quench Fire, or wet Sails of Ships,
such as were Tried before his Majesty near the Banqueting House at Whitehall,
and before the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor and the Worshipful the Aldermen
of the City of London, and several other Persons of Quality at Grocers-Hall.

He also makes small Engines for Watering of Gardens; as also all sorts of
Brass Works for playing of the Water in Fountains; and all sorts of Plumbers
Moulds and Knots for casting of all sorts of Leaden Pipes.

These and all sorts of Sir Samuel Moreland's-Engines as formerly, and all
manner of Engines whatsoever for the Forcing or Draining of Water, are Made by
ISAAC THOMPSON, at the Sign of the Engine in Great Russel Street, over against
Montague-House.
