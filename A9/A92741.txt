True and good News from Brussels.
SIR,
I Return you many thanks for your Letter, and News, and particularly for the
account you give me of General Lockhart; I ever took him for a Gentleman, and,
indeed, the King himself, has always esteemed him one of his fairest
Enemies; Insomuch, as it would have troubled many here, who never saw him, if
he should publicly have borne witness to so mechanic a slander, as that of
seeing his Majesty at Mass: Truly, the Devil had sound out an ill Father for
such a Brat, and therefore, I hope, it will now lie at his own Door. It was
very unlikely, that a Person of his honor, should be guilty of so foul, or a
Man of his wit, of so lame a calumny; Wherein to verify his state, he must, at
once render himself, a base spy, and a false Protestant, for what other
account should bring him into Spanish Towns, and Popish Churches? I read that
part of your Letter to the King, and could not but observe his smile, it was so
grave, and full of Resentment; (for nothing, you know, is more natural to him,
then dumb Rhetoric:) At present, he said little, but three hours after, made
many reflections both witty, and serious: He said, his Enemies were now put to
hard shifts, and he took it for a good Omen, that, already, for want of better
Weapons, they fought with such Bullrushes; That they had timed it very well,
and very ill; Well, for themselves, that related it; But ill for others, that
were to believe it: Since, for more then ten years past, whilst they were
confident of their own Power, they had used no Arguments against him, but
Bullets, and were much unconcerned in his Religion, whether it were Christian,
or Mahumetan; But now, just now, in this Crisis of affairs, when their cause
is, manifestly withering, and his hopes, budding,) least the Nation should,
otherwise, think of restoring him, he who profoundly dissembled all thy while,
chose, it seems, so opportune a juncture, for his profession of Popery, being
in love with banishment, and having, no doubt, therein consulted with his dear
friends Mr. Scot, and Marchamont Needham; that, indeed, it is not the part of
fair enemies to take such advantage of their own wrong, by first driving him to
seek Protection from Papists, and then, upon no other account imaginable,
reporting him a Papist; that, yet, he submits, with all patience, to the good
will of God, since he sees, he must taste of his Fathers Cup, whose lot it was
to be branded by Protestants, for a suspected Papist, and ruined by Jesuits,
as a persevering Protestant: These were his Majesty's own Comments upon the
text, and better cannot be added; yet, being a debt equally due to his own
great virtue, and the satisfaction of all that desire, and are willing to be
satisfied, I cannot, but, upon my own knowledge, attest, that he is not only
a sincere professor, but an approved Champion of the Protestant Religion, and
devoted Son of the Church of England, yet, with much moderation of Judgment
and candor of mind toward those that differ from him; especially in matters,
and outward discipline, and many pregnant instances I could give you, both of
his strictness in the one, and largeness in the other, if I thought it
needful, or that his conversation, and what he has done, and suffered upon
these accounts, were not better evidence for him, then any thing, that I should
say; but, I fear, I have too much honored so silly a detraction.

Your enclosed Pamphlet of news from Brussells is more considerable, as having
a deeper root, and more color, though not in it self, yet in the fears of
those, whom it would seem to concern, for the wounds of guilt are hardly to
be cured, or searched by any Surgery, and the fiend of an evil conscience is
too subtle for exorcismes, not is it in the power of clemency to pardon those,
that will however arraigne themselves, and who think their safety consists not
with the being of him, from whom, otherwise, they might expect it: with such
persons, even promises are threats, they having suggested to themselves, that
they ought as much to fear the snare of moderation, as the Gibbet of severity,
both of them contrived and erected in their own breasts; but these, I trust, are
few, and I can freely say, it must be their own fault, if there be any; for, I
am confident, it is, yet, in the power of the greatest criminal to bail
himself, and none will finally prove guilty, but the implacable, his Majesty
desiring above all things, herein, to imitate, the goodness of God, who
wills no man's destruction, and freely gives to those that ask: as for such
as pronounce against themselves, that their sins are greater, then can be
pardoned, let them, with Cain, fly into the Land of Nod, let the Author of
this Pamphlet and his confederates, dispose of themselves to their best
security, let such furies vent their Diabolical rage; but let not others, who
may be innocent, if they please, choose rather to be guilty.

I have often said of late, that Mr. Needham would yet once more, before he
dyed write for the Cavaliers, and see how soon my prophecy is fulfilled; the
Style, language and sense are purely his, certainly, it was some such precious
Saint, a Cain for Innocence, a Balaam for Integrity, A Judas for Loyalty, a
Corah for Allegiance, and for Christian Prudence, an Achitophel, that compiled
this Creed for reprobates; no novice, or single sinner could arrive at such
perfection, it must be a Vaterane, and an Apostat to boot: he is, I perceive,
most religiously sensible of the Pilgrimage, he owes to TIBURNE, and can never
rest, till he have paid his vows, and offered himself at that shrine.

^^e frontispeice is very observable, being for the greater mockery and
Imposture, adorned with a Crown, and authorized with the style of his Majesty,
who must, it seems, be betrayed with a Kiss, Crucified with a solemn
inscription, and murdered, as it were, before White Hall; But I much marveyle,
the reverend Author should impute the publishing of it to casualty, and not
rather entitle Revelation or Providence to his excellent mysteries, He had
precedents enough in the Case, and perhaps, in the language of the Saints, (who
cannot, now, pick a Pocket, but in Gods name) it had been most agreeable to
truth.

A special Act of Providence, indeed, it was, that made a near attendant on
his Majesty's Person, write so perfectly the sense of Sir Arthur Hazlerigge,
and Mr. Scot, that, (without a Counterrevelation) one would almost swear,
that, whilst the poor Cavaleer wrote, they guided his Pen; Were they now such
Princes, as lately they were, in the RUMP, I should judge, they had wracked
Him, but that his Confession should be so voluntary, so seasonable, and,
withal, so ample, is almost as great a Miracle, as the discovery of a
trepaning Plot.

This surely, may serve for a use of consolation to the godly, what need they
fear any danger, at home, or abroad? Let them discharge their Spies and
Intelligencers, and enjoy the quiet sleep of a good conscience; you see how
their enemies betray their own councels; they are all infatuated, and bereft of
understanding, their best Statesmen have not a Character left to conceal the
deepest mysteries, but must, it seems, resort to Sir C. C. for Sir Charles
Coote, and obscure their malice only with Allegories, as transparent, as
tiffany, or Crystal; errand Woodcocks, no doubt, that think their bodies
safe, if they can but hide their heads.

I presume, there needs no serious argument to prove it spurious, every
syllable smells of Gunpowder, every line Proclaims him a Toad, that could spit
such venom, the contrivance is the quintessence of Jesuitisme, and
King-killing malice; the Publisher himself, I suppose, does not expect it
should be believed, it serves his turn, if it be but read; for he thinks if it
make no report, it will at least give an Alarm, and though the history be not
admitted, the moral may.

To particulars, I will not descend, they are some of them so scurrilous, all
so malicious that I fear, least I should seem to assist or abet such
calumnies; But in general, let me assure you, his Majesty has no such near
attendants, as this would personate, no such fiends haunt his Person, or Court,
his Privy-Councell is known to be entirely Protestant, never suspected of the
contrary, truly English, no less faithful to the Nations interest, then the
Kings, and such as never knew how to separate the service of their Country from
that of their Prince; for two of the principal, I dare answer, that the
burden of their song now is, as it has always been, Sir we beseech you, make
your peace, if you can, and leave us out, for we are not considerable in the
case; all their Counsels have been suitable to their professions, constantly
rejecting the numerous proffers of powerful aid from foreign Princes, upon
inconvenient terms; his Majesty himself is known to be a Prince of a most
sincere, and Noble nature, the true Son of that Father who recommended to him
those divine precepts and principles of charity, clemency, and moderation, the
true Grandson of that Grandfather, who by receiving, nay advancing his
reclaimed enemies, and by observing all the agreements he made, as a King, no
less punctually, then he did articles of war, as a General has, in some
measure, stopped the mouths of our desperados, nay has taught the world, that
great provocations may be forgotten, great Records cancelled, great Errors
favorably censured, and that the word of a King is of more value, then the
oath of a Common-wealths-man.

The generality of our Courtiers, and visitants, who, now, begin to appear in
great numbers, are, (excepting a few light fellows, looked upon, as the chafe
or dregs of the party, and, rather for hospitalities sake, not excluded, then,
for friendship, admitted) very moderate, and apt (as Courtiers commonly are) to
receive Impressions from their Prince, so as nothing is discoursed in out
Cabales, but the healing of Breaches, the necessity of unfeigned reconcilement
with the true Presbyterian, the danger of a faithless and hollow-hearted
Union, the hazard of destruction to the Nation; but certainly of ruin to our
selves, if through our spleen or obstinacy, once more, we relapse, into a state
of War; the chief design of the time and place is to set on foot an
interest, truly national, and comprehensive, as much, as may be, of all
interests, not such a one, as shall gratify any one party to the prejudicing,
or disobliging of others; Persons of mixed Principles are chiefly cherished,
such as speak the language of our Pamphleteer, have the Brand of Incendiaries,
and Emissaries; I could heartily wish, that you in England did so well
distinguish, and mark them all for right Pageants, who serve the RUMP in the
Kings Livery.

But I fear I have already exceeded the lawful bounds of a Letter, and
therefore must conclude, I pray present my service to our Western friends, and
fail not to give me the first, and most particular account you can of
Elections, for they are the most important news, the season can afford, till
the sitting of the next Parliament.

I remain, SIR, Your true, and affectionate friend to serve you. W. S.
Brussels, March 20th. S. V. 1659.
FINIS.
