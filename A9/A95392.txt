AN ELOGY UPON THE Much lamented Death of Mr Luke Fawn, junior, who dyed the
sixth of January, 1650. being Ten Years, six Months, and four days old.
I AM big with Grief, That I can only vent
My Passion in a sad Astonishment:
My Sorrows are turned rude, and do dispense
A Fury greater, then thy Innocence.
Could there be so great Guilt on such young Years,
That justly could deserve these pious Tears?
Did the too partial Heavens but lend Thy Sight,
Thus to engage us in Eternal Night?
Did they Thy Life on us at first bestow,
Only to make thee but a Ten Years Show?
But I have done; Thou were too good to be
Continued in a Land of Misery.
We grieve Our Loss, not Thine; for we are left here
To the sad Comfort of a sadder Tear.
See how each Forehead's furrowed to a Frown,
And every Eye its willing Tears drops down;
Mourning Thy Loss, as if the World and all
Its Creatures suffered in Thy untimely Fall.
Thy Loss is fatal to the World; in Thee
Nature has lost her highest braverie.
Thy Parts in so young Years did strongly prove
Thou were her only Darling, and her Love.
How did Thy Sweetness ecstasy our Sense
Into a wonder of Thy Excellence!
Thy Virtues were too great for to have grown
In any clay besides what was Thine own.
Thou were the purest Dust, that e're was made
T'enclose so bright a Soul within a Shade.
-- But Oh! it is gone
TO its last and greatest Dissolution.
And our full Tears, at best, will prove to be
But faint Drops of a Pious Ecstasy.
Look back to the Spring, and if you e're have seen
Untimely winds blast Trees scarce fully green,
Know that our Loss is such, since He has shown,
E're a ripe Spring, such blossoms of his own.
Fate sure past over his years, and viewed his parts
Arraigned to the Bar, not for his age, but arts.
Whoever saw a loaded ear of Corn
Not Earth-wards tend? the empty upwards born:
E're life they dye; e're death thou life did scorn.
Piaetatis Ergo, sic cecinit, Robertus Tutchein.
