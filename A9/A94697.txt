TO THE SVPREME AVTHORITY OF THIS COMMONWEALTH, THE PARLIAMENT of ENGLAND: The
humble Petition of the Creditors of such Delinquents whose Estates are
propounded to be sold, as the Petitioners are informed.
THe Petitioners humbly crave leave to offer to your Honorable considerations,
That the Debts due to the Petitioners by the said Delinquents, were contracted
by them by Bonds, and other securities made bona fide, whilst the said
Delinquents were in good esteem and reputation with the Parliament; and whilst
some of them were sitting, as Members of Parliament: and before it was known to
the Petitioners, or could be any way imagined by them, that the said persons
would fall into the condition of Delinquents.

That if persons which have such just Debts due to them by those Delinquents,
should be debarred of their just Debts, many Widows, Orphans, and others well
affected to the Parliament, would be utterly undone: And therefore the
Petitioners (under favor) humbly conceive, it was never the intention of the
Parliament, that such a sad and lamentable destruction should fall on so many
Innocent persons, who were never involved in the guilts of those Delinquents.

And thence it is, (as the Petitioners humbly conceive) that the Parliament
having formerly in their wisdom adjudged it fit to except some persons as not
fit to be admitted to Compound, did with great justice and Piety provide (as
well by Votes, and particular Orders, in some cases, as by general provisoes
in some Ordinances of Parliament) that sundry Debts due by such Delinquents by
Bonds, should be paid out of the Sequestration, or upon the sale of those
Delinquents Estates.

That the Petitioners observation of the Honorable and tender care had by the
Parliament of making such just and honorable provision, for preserving the
just Debts and Rights of Creditors in all such cases, and the Petitioners
confident assurance in the goodness and piety of the Parliament, to be
preserved from the loss of their said Debts, was indeed, the reason that has
hitherto withheld the Petitioners from becoming troublesome to your Honors
with their humble suits herein. But now understanding that the Estates of those
Delinquents who are indebted to the Petitioners are propounded to be sold,

The Petitioners do most humbly beseech your Honors, that in the Act to be
drawn up for the same, there may be a proviso inserted, that the Petitioners be
paid their just Debts, out of the Sequestration, or upon the sale of the said
Delinquents Estates; so to preserve from utter ruin, and destruction, many
innocent Men, Women, and Children, whom certainly the Parliament intend not to
prejudice by the Sale of those Delinquents Estates.

And they shall pray, etc.
