A Sad Caveat to all QUAKERS.

Not to boast any more that they have God Almighty by the hand, when they have
the Devil by the toe.

Containing a true Narration of one William Pool an Apprentice, and a known
Quaker near Worcester, who on Friday, in last Febr. the 20. boasting that he
had that day Christ by the hand, and must according to appointment go to him
again, did on that evening by the temptation and impulsion of the Devil drown
himself in the River. Together with the Judgment of the Coroner and Jury, who
found him guilty of self-Murder.

As also the most barbarous usage of some Quakers who dug him out of his
Grave. And the most unparaleled presumption of one Mrs Susan Peirson, who
undertook to raise him again to life, with the whole manner of it, and the
words that at that time she uttered; The like whereof never heard in
Christendom.

A sad Caveat to all Quakers.
THe Church of God has oftentimes found many opposers but never more then in
this Age. The word of God was never more powerfully preached, and the Devil
never more busy to sow his tares then at this present. And in this the policy
of the Devil is very remarkable which is to overthrow the Gospel by the Gospel,
that is by perverting the sense of the Gospel, by making many false glosses,
and Comments, and Interpretations on it, nay by making the Gospel to appear
but as a dead letter, compared to the light which they pretend to have within
them. Although the Devil I say in all ages, has raised up many Enemies,
against the Gospel, yet his malice did never work more prevalently then now,
it works the more prevalently because it works with so much subtilty and
deceit, and because it is disguised with so much sanctity, surely the Devil did
never so often transform himself into an Angel of light, by holding forth
false lights then in these days. Had they bin Jews who had blasphemed the
Gospel, we could have discovered, and aveyded them? Had they bin Mahometans or
Turks we could with more confidence have confuted them? Had they bin Athists we
could either have convinced, or have punished them, but they are a Generation
of men sprang up amongst us, who do carry an infection with them, an infection
which is the more dangerous because it over-runs every part preservatiues into
the rankest poison? The zeal of these men is but dissimulation, their prayers
are an abhominatione their Doctrine but prophanes and the whole Conversation of
their lives a Labyrinth wherein they lose themselves in the many errors and
turnings of spiritual pride.

I shall not need to make any large discovery of them every day produces one
remarkable example or another, I shall only represent unto you a Narration of
one of them who boasting that he had Christ by the hand, it proved sadly
afterward by the sequel, that he had the Devil by the toe.

His Name was William Pool he was an Apprentice to one Georg Knight of the
Parish of Clains in the City of Worcester, his Master heretofore lived in a
good Fame, by a good trade had he not driven at the last a bad trade by keeping
convenation with the Quakers, with whose Principles he was so strongly
possessed that from being a Brother in Christ he would now become Christ in a
Brother. The Quakers are not ashamed to affirm that Christ is parsonally in
them by which wild assertion if we should umpe with them in that belief it
would come to pass that there would be as many Christ's as there are
Christians, and alluding to the opinion of the Papists in their point of
predestination, the Body of Christ would at one and at the same time being
several bodies, and in several places which is absolutely repugnant unto sense
and reason,

This man had heretofore bin accounted a sincere Professor, but now he began
to conc^ive himself to be above all Ordinances, and to be a despiser of that
truth which he before professed: He was sometimes esteemed to be a very honest
neighbor, but now he looked upon them with a scornful and censorious eye, as
if they were not worthy of his countenance, yet he would be familiar with his
Apprentice William Pool they was of the same mind, which made them outwardly to
agree so well together, and yet this compliance was not so extraordinary but it
sometimes carried with it some tokens of distaste.

On a time the father of William Pool coming to see him, he found his Master
and him very earnest in disputation together; the Apprentice did thou his
Master at every word, the Father of the Apprentice did much admire at the
incivility of his son, and that the older he grew he was every day more
unmannerly then other.

He therefore did reprove him for it, but both Master and man did satisfy him
concerning that particular, and did assure him that his Son in those words did
express himself punctually, and that it was not his rudeness, but his
Religion; the old man departed, and the Apprentice and his Master did live
together with a mutual concurrence and harmony of affection; It did so fall
out (as commonly it is seen) that the rankest weeds grow thickest and highest,
that the City of Worcster and places thereabouts did begin to be overspread
with Quakers, many persons who before pretended much unto Religion being
seduced and carried away by this violent torrent; and those who were esteemed
to be most zealous for the truth did suffer themselves to fall into this error,
such a face of sanctimony and humility did these seducers put on them.

Amongst these William Pool began to be very well known, and as some (who
suffered not long since) did pretend they were Christ; so this young man did
affirm that he did shake hands with Christ: to be thus familiar with Christ did
swell him up into a great presumption, when alas he was altogether ignorant
what a desperate Familiar he had gotten; he now believes himself to be lifted up
into the Heavens, and to be above the condition of other men when he is in the
lowest and most lamentable condition in the world, the pride of heart and the
temptations of the devil do increase together: It seems that the Prince of
darkness had appeared to him in the shape of some goodly personage, and this
credulous young man was apt to believe that it was Christ; poor man he was not
much above two and twenty years of age, an age apt to be seduced and carried
away, especially when it is attended with a spirit that entertaineth an
extraordinary conceit of it self, and would appear higher and holier then
others.

On Friday the twentieth of February about three of the clock in the afternoon
he did walk forth from his masters house into the Garden, where having made
some stay longer then ordinary he was demanded where he had bin, he made answer
that he had bin with Christ, and that Christ had taken him by the hand, and
that he had appointed him to come to him again, and that he must go unto him.

This was a strong temptation of the Devil that was upon this poor man, and it
is most apparent that it was a temptation of the Devil, for all other
temptations that do proceed from a man's self do side with nature, but for a man
to be tempted to destroy himself is absolutely against nature, and must be a
mere temptation of the Devil You Sir know by what spirit this Quaker did act,
you shall now see what he does act. This poor young man goes forth again, but
to return no more, what were the apparitions which he saw may we concern were
the temptations that were upon him; When the night began to grow old, he is
missed, and no man can jmmagine what is become of him, for he was never known
to stay out late before? the night is drawn out betwixt fear and hope, and the
morning appearing, Messingers are sent to enquire him out, but they return with
a Nonestinventus, and which make it the more strange, none of his acquaintance
or kindred can posibly direct them where to find him.

In these perplexities they continue all Saturday, and Saturday night, and no
tidings could be heard of him. On Sunday morning there were many more at
leisure to seek after him, and some walking one way and some another, one of
them at last had discovered some Clothes which lay by the Rivers side, they
were the Clothes of the young man whom so long they looked for; and casting
his eye up and down, and observing at last the dead body floting on the water,
he had not the leisure to take it up, but making have to some acquaintance they
came al in together being all amazed at so sad a spectacle, they took the
dead body out of the River, and covering it with a Cloth they brought it to
his Masters house? Immediately the Town was full of sorrow and Complaint
especially against the Quakers and some women of Note thereabouts who being
seduced themselves did contribute their utmost Endeavors to seduce others.
This was much seconded by the Ministers sermon that afternoon, who taking an
occasion to discourse upon this subject did represent what advantage the Devil
did take to improve his temptations, and how near of kin is spiritual pride
to Hell.

Sermon being ended, the Coroner was sent for and a Jury impanneled, and it was
easily found that the Quaker who had drowned himself was guilty of self-murder;
nevertheless they were so full of pity as to exempt the dead body from that
sentence to which those who do destroy themselves are liable, for he was not
buried in the Highway, he had no stake plated with Iron thrust through his
body to terrify all passengers from committing such a black and desperate act,
but on the Monday following about four of the clock in the morning he was
civilly buried in the Parish of Clains: The mercy of the parish where he lived
did quietly commit him to the Grave, but the barbarous boldness and presumtion
of the Quakers with whom he conversed would not suffer him to rest quiet in his
Grave, but on the same morning about eleven of the clock they dug him up
again to show a wonder upon him, which being one of the most daring and
presumptuous deeds that was ever known in Christendom. To show you of what
spirit these Quakers are I will be careful in these following lines to give
you a true account thereof.

The most presumptuous attemt of Mrs. Susan Peirson and other Quakers, who who
commanded the dead body of this their deceased friend to be taken out of the
Grave, madly and vainly promising his Mother that they would restore it unto
life again.
I Made mention a little before that there were some women of note who
suffering themselves to be seduced by these great Deceivers, did use their
utmost endeavors to seduce others. In this number was one Mistress Susan
Peirson, who by reason of her quality, and great abilities adding some
Authority to her Illusions, did wonderfully serve to increase the number of the
Deceived: she was heretofore very much beloved for the many good parts that
were eminent in her, she appeared to be a great lover of the Gospel, a strict
and constant observer of the Sabbath, a diligent hearer of the Word, but being
overcome by hyp crisies and the pretended sanctity of this sect of the Quakers,
she turned from being a lo^er of Ordinances to be a despiser of Ordinances, and
briefly to act and utter any thing that a profane and an unruly rage could
prompt her to. She entertained a belief, that to derogate from the Authority of
the Ministers was to increase her own, she therefore did moke it her practice
to come into the Churches where the Ministers were preaching, and interrupting
them as well praying as preaching; she would demand of them what Authority they
could show to prove themselves Ministers, and whethei they could justify
themselves to be Ministers by the working of miracles, quite forgetting or
disdaining the Doctrine of Saint Paul, That a woman ought to be silent, and not
to speak in the Congregation.

The Mother of this young Quaker that thus desperately drowned himself, being
extraordinarily perplexed for the loss of her son in so strange a manner, and
almost refusing to be comforted, Mistress Susan Peirson does make her hasty
addresses to her, she reproves her superfluous tears, and assures her that she
would restore unto her her son again by a quickening Miracle that she would work
upon him; The Miracle indeed was, that the Devil should so much blind her as to
undertake so great an impossibility to the utter disgracing of a creature that
had been so useful to him, and may serve to represent unto us what a
difference there is in the disposition of their ways detwixt the eye of
providence and the spirit of darkness; but the sad Mother at the first was
obstinate, and could not be endured to give any ear unto her; It was almost as
great a wonder to work in her the belief of the wonder, as to work the wonder
i^ self, she was too sure that her son was drowned, and she did weep so
bitterly for him as if she would drown him again in her tears; nevertheless at
the last she condescended to the importunity of her friends, and she came unto
the Grave rather to observe then to enjoy the Miracle; The busy Spades of the
Quakers had now opened the Grave, and the body of the young man being dug up
and laid upon she ground, the shroud was taken off, when Mistress Peirson
drawing nigh unto it, did rub his face and his breast wi h her hand, and laying
her face upon his face, and her hands upon his hands, she did command him to
arise: The eyes of the multitude at those words were all sixed upon the dad
body, being intent to observe what the event would be; it came also into their
minds that the Prophet Elisha had in the same manner raised a young man to life
who had been dead, and that our Savior Christ had raised Lazarus four days
buried, which made them the more earnest to press near unto her, and with a
curious diligence to observe what passed: But the Body not moving at all, and
neither voice nor sneezing being observed to proceed from it, she kneeled down
and prayed over it, and did command him in the Name of the Living God, to rise
up and walk: At these words a little pausa was made, and theople were full of
silence and expectation, but the body not stirring at all, and neither life,
nor any hope of life appearing, Mistress Peirson commanded them to put it into
the Grave again, excusing her self, that it had not been duried four days, and
speaking those words she departed being ashamed at the heart at the ill success
of the frantic enterprise she undertook, since which time, to their perpetual
disgrace, the Arrogance of the generation of the Quakers in general and the
shame and sorrow, and retiredness of Mistress Peirson in particular, is become
the daily discourse and laughter of the City of Worcester, and of all the
Country round about it.

The End.
