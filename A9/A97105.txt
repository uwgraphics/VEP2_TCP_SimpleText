SOME CONSIDERATIONS Tending to the undeceiving those, whose judgments are
misinformed by Politic Protestations, Declarations, etc.
Being a necessary discourse for the present times, concerning the unseasonable
difference between the Protestant and the PURITAN.
THE end of the Parliaments consultations, and actions, is to free the Kingdom
(the care whereof is to them by the Kingdom committed) from all those heavy
tyrannies and oppressions which for many years, against express Laws, and
cautions to the contrary, have surrounded and overwhelmed the Kingdom, all
which, if we have not a desire to let them slip our memories, the Parliaments
first Remonstrance will fully present unto us. Those men that do oppose the
Parliament, are generally such as some way or other have thrived under those
pressures, as being made instruments and actors in them, or else being addicted
to vice and looseness, found that connivence and indulgence, then which, in
times more reformed they cannot expect. Those men that do now side with, and
assist the Parliament, are such as in those corrupt times were trodden under
foot, such as were vexed and impoverisht by insulting Courts, and
Court-officers, forced against conscience to persuade to the breach of the
Sabbath, compelled to fly their Country, or separate from the Church, by
inducing vain and empty Ceremonies, which direct our minds from consideration
of Gods love to us in Christ, and are utterly inconsistent with the true, and
spiritual worship of God; and indeed therefore pressed upon us, that thereby
their friends might be known from their foes, the easy to be abused from the
more difficult, that they might be embraced, and have all encouragements both
from the Minister, and men of high places; and these disgraced, prosecuted, and
though of never so honest lives, yet if in all things not conformable,
scandalled, and made odious: Ceremonies were therefore too pressed upon us,
that by them the Church becoming more pompous, and outwardly specious, the
Clergy (by whom the Statesmen were especially to do their ill intended work)
might win greater esteem, and grow more and more reverenced by the people, who
seldom they know dive into the reasons of things, but are usually carried away
by outward shows and appearances. The Parliaments other friends are such as
have been tormented with the permitted corruption of Lawyers, those devouring
Locusts, no less ravening then the Aegyprian ones that overspread that Land;
such likewise as had lost the liberty of Trade, for the gaining of which, they
served a long and tedious apprenticeship, by unlawful engrossments, and
Patents; and all the multitude of good men, who are sensible either by their
own, or their neighbors sufferings, of the injuries of former times, or
desirous to prevent and divert our oppression and slavery for the future: Now
as it is a notable policy of evil men, though of quite different and opposite
conditions to combine and associate together against all that oppose them,
bearing with, and passing by any thing for the present, though at other times
much distasteful. So how much more does it behove the honest men of this
Kingdom, who are likely to taste equally the sweetes of liberty, or the bitter
pills of slavery, how ever they may be persuaded otherwise for the present, to
unite themselves heart and hand, to join together as one man, against all
those whom they shall discern either to oppose the Parliament, or endeavor to
raise divisions and differences among themselves. The only way for our enemies
to do their work, is not by strength, and force of Arms, for what ever their
brags be, and how great soever their boasts by which they would seem to have
what they have not, that thereby they may encourage their party, and dishearten
their adversaries, yet indeed their forces are but small, their provisions
scanty, their means and money only supplied by rapine, which cannot be lasting,
having neither Forts, nor Shipping, so that it cannot be that by strong hand
they should have any hope to do their work: No certainly, and yet
notwithstanding they still dare to hold up the Cudgels, seem as confident as
ever, bear up, as if the world were of their side; what should be the reasons
hereof; reasons there are, we must persuade our selves, it is not to be
supposed that they are foole-hardy, or that the sense of their many mischiefs
have made them desperate, because past hope of reconcilement (though they well
may) their Councels are notable, and surely come not short of the most able the
world affords, their subtleties exceeds the Foxes, or the Serpents, Romes or
Spaines; whose most damnable glory it is, that from mean beginnings they, by
their wits especially, have raised themselves to the most extended tyrannies in
the Christian world: and why should our politic enemies then despair? Since
their wits are as quick, their consciences as deeply pained and senseless,
many of our people as easy to be deluded as ever men were, having the
assistance of former contrivances in making men slaves, furnished with
Machiavils, and The Author of the Machivilian plot.
Staffords instructions from Florence, with all the assistance Romes
consistory, or Spaines can afford: and what force cannot do, deceit may: a
subtle deceitful Declaration may do much more mischief then an Army, the one
kills men outright, and so leaves them unserviceable for both sides, but
deceitful words, when for want of consideration, unsettlednesse of judgment,
and weak information, they captivate men, they make them not only dead to good
men's assistance, and their Countries service, but promoters likewise of their
deluders interest, to the insensible ruin and slavery of their brethren, and
in conclusion, of themselves. Deceits and delusions are the principal weapons
with which the evil Counselors now fight; by which they subdue and captivate
the understandings and affections of men; to scatter these, they hurry about
from one County into another, and there at Assizes, and other forced Assemblies
practice, in one place they color and gloss over their own evil actions,
with seeming pretenses of Law, Religion: in another, they scandalize and
traduce the Parliament, for as they cannot want paint to make foul and
unsightly actions seem fair and specious, so neither can they want dirt and
mire to disfigure the best formed, and most honest enterprises in the world;
words are never defective to make evil seem good, and good evil: what
villainy was there ever committed, or what injustice, but words and pretenses
might be found to justify it: Monopolies were once pleaded legal, and very
wholesome for the people, we were once persuaded Ship Money was lawful, and
now Commission of Array; if unjust things were offered to us, as they are,
without disguise and artificial covering, they would appear so odious, as
that each man would cry out upon them, and therefore it is a high point of
policy to make the worst things show fairest, speak best, when they intend
most mischief. In other Counties the people were thanked for their affections
and assistance, when they found them wiser then to yield any, and when they
were driven by necessity to a place, they would seem to be invited by love,
and certainty of compliance, when God knows in many places they found it much
otherwise, and would likewise elsewhere too, but that the people were
necessitated to their assistance by force, rather then forward, out of any
liking. Well, their policies and delusions are most numerous, and every day
increasing, and therefore it behooves every wise man to stand upon his guard, to
be wary and watchful that he be not apprehended by their fubtilties: in
nothing there is required greater care, their invasions being insensible, and
having once seized upon a man, he no longer dislikes, but approves of them,
they force a man to love what ere whiles he hated, what he but now cried down,
to plead for, and not to observe, because his intentions are honest, and he
means no ill, that he is even against his knowledge his Countries enemy: He
that can give any cautions how to resist their wyles, or show wherein we are
already seduced by our cunning adversaries, does do very good service to his
Country, and deserves to be heard; this discourse was written principally for
that end, namely, to discover to all good men how they have suffered themselves
to be wrought upon by the adversary in a case very considerable, and thereby,
though they observe it not, are become friends to their Countries chief foes,
and foes to their principal friends. The work of evil Counselors, as it is
to unite and join together their friends, so is it likewise to separate and
divide their foes amongst themselves: all such are their foes as truly love
their own liberty, and desire to free themselves from their insulting tyranny:
it must needs be very advantageous to them, if by any means they can divide
these, for being disioyned, they cannot possibly be so powerful against them
as otherwise they would be, did they continue at union: now amongst many other
ways that they have used to accomplish this end, there is not one has been
more effectual then in raising, and cherishing differences concerning forms
and circumstances about Religion, that so setting them together by the ears
about shadows, they may in the mean time steal away your substance: there is
no difference they full well know is so permanent, as that which any way
touches upon Religion, and therefore like cunning Pioners, have lighted upon
what is likely to make the greatest breach, which by continual plying the
work, the difference daily increasing, it is much to be feared that all the
pains the Parliament takes, the assistance of good men, the hazzards of our
resolute soldiers, or whatever endeavors else are used for the accomplishing
of good men's desires, will by this one difference, if continued, be utterly
frustrate, and come to naught: for it is almost come to that pass, that the
Puritan and Sectaries, as they are called, are more odious to the Protestant,
then the Cavalier, Malignant, or Papist: all our discourses are diverted now by
the cunning practice of the Politician from our forepast calamities, plots, and
conspiracies of lewd men, from thinking what will be the best ways to speed
and advantage our undertakings for our liberty, to raylings against the
Puritan, to cross and oppose the Puritan, to provoke him by many insolences,
and affronts to disorders, and then to inveigh with all bitterness against his
disorders: if at such times as these, when so great a work is in hand, as the
freeing of us from slavery, we can be so drowzily fottish as to neglect that,
for the satisfying our giddy and domineering humor, what can be said of us,
but that our fancy is dearer to us then our liberty, that we care not what goes
to rack, though it be our substantial Religion, Laws, and Liberties, so
wedoe but please our selves in crying down our Brethren, because they are
either more zealous, or else more scrupulous then our selves: These things my
friends, (for all good men are such) do show that you are not considerate, nor
do not sufficiently bear in mind what was told you in the Parliaments first
Remonstrance, that it was (and still is) one of the principal works of our
common enemy, to sow division between the Protestant and Puritan, you have
been too easy, and quickly wrought upon by him for the accomplishing that
work: I would to God you would lay it to heart; the Puritan intends no
mischief to any, you may assure your selves he does not: if you inquire you
shall find that they had no hand in our former oppressions, they were no
maintainers of any unjust courses, or Courts, unless by those many fines which
were extorted from them, for that they of all men had the courage to withstand
their injuries: we hear of daily plunderings, rapes, and murders of the
Cavaliers, women with child run through, and many other butcheries, and yet
we pass by these, as if by no interest they concerned us, and let fly our
speeches only against the Puritan for plucking a rail down, or a pair of
Organs, a Surplice, Crucifix, or painted window, which are indeed no way
conducible to the substantial worship of God, and yet retained by the ill
disposed Clergy, as fuel to yield matter to that discord they would continue
amongst you: See how much too blame we are, see how exceedingly the politician
has deluded us, that we should do thus, and yet see not that we do unwisely.
If thy brother be weak and thou strong, bear with his weakness, or if the
Puritan esteerne thee weak, and himself strong, it will be a good lesson to
him; if we be strong we should bear with them that are weak; if we are weak
we should not judge them that are strong, it will be no shame for any one to
take the Apostles advice; let not slight and indifferent things divide our
affections; let them not especially when substantial things lie at the stake;
it is all one as if our enemy being in the field with full purpose and speed to
destroy us, we should turn aside to exclaim against a man that flung dirt
upon us or laughed at us: and wholly neglect altogether to defend our selves:
what a shame will it be unto us, when hereafter it is said that the English
might have freed themselves from oppression and slavery, but that in the doing
of it they neglected their common enemy, and fell at variance among themselves
for trifles. Ceremonies and other things that occasion difference, are stickled
for by the Protestant, not for that they think them necessary, for surely
unless it be for some indirect end they cannot be urged to be so, but for that
they are not yet taken down by authority: The Puritan they would have them
taken away for that they conceive them vain, unwarrantable by Gods Word,
relics of the Romish Religion not thoroughly purged away, and therefore they
desire they should be left off by us, which are the principal cause of their
separation from us: In all differences to be unwilling to reconcile, shows
not a spirit of love, which Christians should ever be possessed withal, but of
pride and contention, the Protestant has not the engagements of conscience
upon him, as the Puritan has, and therefore may the easier bear with the
Puritans infirmities, if meat offend my weak brother I will eat no meat as
long as I live, what an excellent thing were it if we could have that hold fast
over our selves that the Apostle had to refrain from any thing how pleasant
and dear soever unto us, rather then give any offense, or occasion any
difference between our selves and weak brethren: let every man think of the
answering this question to himself: whether if lewd men do get the better
over the Parliament and honest men of the Kingdom, either Protestant or
Puritan are likely to be any other but slaves: Certainly if any of them do
persuade themselves otherwise, they are like the stiff-necked and unweildy
Hebrews, that wished they were slaves in Egypt again, where the much loved
Flesh pots were, for that it was troublesome and dangerous passing through the
Wilderness into Canaan, a land of plenty and lasting liberty. Be not deceived
with deluding thoughts of former times, when plenty covered our oppressions,
and because of peace we could not see our slavery: it was a time when such as
Buckingham, Strafford, domineering Bishops, corrupt and lawless Judges, grew
rich and potent: when Courts Minions for no services but slavery and luxury
were exalted, when offices were not conferred on foreseen venue and honest
desert, but were bought and sold; when honors that ought to be the rewards of
venue, were by gold purchased, and they only deemed fit Subjects for both,
that were easy to be corrupted, such as had stupid consciences, and would
suffer their matters to undertak any dishonest employment. He that wishes for
former times wishes for such times wherein it had been much better for a man
to let go his right or inheritance, though never so apparently his, to any
varlet that would have laid but any colorable claim to it, rather then have
bin wurried by Court Mastives, and eaten to the bare bones by griping Judges
and avaritious Lawyers; wherein a murder in one man was not so much punished as
a word in another, wherein a poor man was hanged for stealing food for his
necessity, and a luxurious Courtier of whom the world was never like to have
any other fruits but oaths and stabbes, could be pardoned after the killing
the second or third man: wherein in a word, knaves were set upon honest men's
shoulders, all looseness was countenanced, and virtue and piety quite out of
fashion: In these times, who kept themselves so steady as the Puritan, who
opposed against those exorbitant courses, and by that means who smarted more
then they: sure I I think their sufferings are yet in each man's memory, who
but they, or they especially withstood all Church innovations, and other taxes
and impositions, for which both the Bishops and Clergy, as also the corrupt
Statesman, and Projector were their professed and open enemies, and even then to
make them odious, invented ridiculous names for them, and studied scurrilous
tales and jests against them, and ever signed new devices concerning them, to
direct our thoughts from our every days oppressions, to sport at the Puritan.
The ways of wicked men are like the way of a Ship in the Sea, so quick and
speedily covered, that without much observancy we cannot trace them: So that we
see these endeavors to make the Puritan odious is no new policy, nor yet the
reasons why it is endeavored, and how great a blemish it is unto our judgment,
that though this deceit has been so long in practice, and so apparently
mischievous to good, and advantageous to bad men, we should not yet discover
it, or being discovered and declared unto us, we should not lay it to heart,
and endeavor to avoid it. Sure I think there is no more evident mark of our
disaffections to the Parliament, then our invectives against the Puritan, whom
the Parliament and all good men ought in all reason to esteem well of, for
that they have been so abundant in their contributions, so forward in their
services, so neglective of their private, to advance that necessary and most
allowable work, both by God and all reasonable men in the world, of freeing us
and our posterity from loathsome Tyranny and oppression: whatsoever faults the
Puritan has, this is not a time to cast them in his dish, neither are we
certain that they are faults, we have but so digested them to our selves, what
he can say for himself, in his own justification, is not yet heard, nor is
there yet a time of hearing: we may assure our selves that the Parliament will
endeavor all that possible they can to give all sorts of men that will not
prove obstinate, and unsatisfiable, the best and largest satisfaction: If they
should now go about it, or if they should at any time heretofore have
enterprised it, they might in the mean time have had their throats cut, it is
and has been the endeavor of the Kings evil advisers, to urge them always
to the settlement of the Church, a work they know requires much time for the
performance of it, and so must of necessity have diverted all considerations
and provisions for their safety, when in the mean time those advisers would
have been most active and vigilant, losing no jot of time, nor balking no
opportunity or advantage to have fortified themselves, made a prey of the
Parliament, and in their ruins have buried all that's near and deer unto us: We
see, that though the Parliament have only intended one business, the defense
and preservation of themselves, and the Kingdom, so great opposition has yet
been made, and so difficult a work have they found it, that there is no man
can say they are too forward: and therefore if we will not wilfully make our
selves a prey to our common enemy, let us resolve for the time to come firmly
to unite our affections beyond the policy of evill-witted men to dissolve: let
those whom the malignant and inconsiderate call Puritans, endeavor all that
they can possibly, to give no offense to the Protestant, and let the Protestant
be slow in taking any at the Puritan: the Puritan indeed is too blame in his
not observing all he can to win by love, gentle behavior, such as differ from
him in opinion, in not endeavoring all he can to bridle his passion, and not
suffer his different opinion to cool his love and affection to other men:
what? We have all need one of another, and till such time things are thoroughly
canvassed, and examined (how ever each man concludes himself to be in the
right (we know we are partial to our selves) he may be mistaken, and upon
better reasons which as yet he sees not may alter his judgment and be
convinced; let us unite together as one man to the extirpation of certain and
discovered enemies both of our substantial Religion, our laws, and liberties,
that so all being quiet, and we assuredly freemen, all stratagems dissolved,
and the Sun of peace again appearing, the Church may be so purged and so
religiously settled, that the Puritan may have no cause of separation (which
cannot be according to his desire but that to which by the instigation of his
conscience he is necessitated too) and so may be no longer an eyesore and
distasteful to the Protestant, but both may with mutual joy and peace of
conscience join together in praises and thanksgivings to that God, who by the
free, and alone death of his Son attoned and reconciled us to himself, end
in giving us his Son has together with him given us all things also. But to
what purpose will this, or other discourses of this nature be, when there is a
sort of people in this kingdom, who make it their study and bend all their
endeavors for to increase and enlarge this difference: and yet have full
permission, and all opportunity that may be to do their work; neither could
the politician have ever made this breach or extended it to that business it
is at, but for the certain assistance of the Clergy, who for that end bound
them his instruments, by the liberal distribution of honors and preferments,
by enlargements of dignity and livings by giving them power in Courts, and
letting them taste the sweets of domination: by authorizing them in their
advance of tithes, multiplying their duties, favoring them in their abundant
differences, and restless lawsuits; and in all likelihood they must be their
servants who pay them such large wages; info much that in all the time of this
Kingdoms slavery and wicked men's oppressions of us, who were greater promoters
of both then the Clergy; what was the politic subject of their Sermons then,
and discourses, but the advance of prerogative, and unlimited sway; the gayning
of estimation to themselves not by their doctrines or lives, for what could be
more corrupt and scandalous, but by subtle delusions, and delusive sophismes;
the fitting of our minds for slavery, the abasing of our courages against
injuries in Church or State; by preaching for obedience to all commands good or
bad, under deceitful terms of active and passive, by which means injurious
men were heartned in enduring mischiefs, and good men moap'd and stupefied to
a patient sufferance of them, their very tongues tied up and no liberate given
so much as to motion against apparent in juries, or to discover to the world
the iniquity of them: This use is made of those most admirable gifts we
admire the Clergy for, to this good end serves their great learning and
excellent parts; and as in former times by these and many other ways they
only employed their studies to make us apt and easy to admit our slavery
without grudging or gainsaying, so do they still continue the Statesmens
hirelings, to further that difference between the Protestant and Puritan,
which makes so much for their advantage: And that they may be truly
serviceable, (...) this end (...) are brought up in the Universities fitted for
the purpose; no man there countenanced unless he is like to prove a champion
against the Puritans, the greater their abilities are that way, their
preferments are answerable, insomuch, that generally those Ministers are only
good, that trusting only to themselves, and not taking the pleasing course,
could expect no encouragement from the Bishop or others in high places, but
very contentedly did betake themselves to such places their honest friends and
deserts obtained for them, whereas men of that other strain were almost
courted into benefices, where the former benefits did not more sway with to
justify injustice, and sow division, then the longing expectation after
greater and greater preferments; and what though some have refused preferments,
and yet are zealous in your work; it is well known yet that they live in
abundance, drink the sweet, and eat the fat of the Land, are recompensed with
large gifts, and abundant Legacies; who by a cunning refufall of what they need
not, and perhaps they think would be too troublesome have taken so deep root
in unwatchfull men's minds, that there are none so great promoters of this work
as they; who likewise being the most subtle of all the tribe, order the
business so, that what by their abilities of speech, reverent estimation men
have of their persons, of their functions, of their sincerity, they even
delude them as they list, and have so far fomented this fire of dissension
that it is to be seared it will very shortly break out into a flame: they
have even heightened this hatred to an insurrection, the people rise up one
against another, grow into factions and acquaintances by wearing colors, and
public meetings, outfacing authority, and slighting the most sovereign power,
even of the Parliament it self; nor is this likely in short time to be
entinguisht, though much care be used, and great pains taken for the doing it,
so long as a cunning malicious sort of men are suffered without control or
just punishment to yield new matter to this destructive flame of contention; to
curb the license, and punish the insolences of those licentious Clergymen may
very well be one of the principal works of the Parliaments, whose earnest
endeavors and noble undertakings do find no greater opposition from any sort
of men, no not from the Cavalier himself, or the Kings evil Counselors, then
from these men of malice and dissension; many of them are Delinquents, and so
voted, others likewise would appear to be so, did the people think it a fit
time to make their complaints many of them are of scandalous and debaucht
lives, all of them indeed are bound by the respects they have to their own
safety to destroy the Parliament, by whom they know, were they at leisure they
should be sifted, and their crimes censured, and to bring in again the former
government, wherein they found so great connivance in all sorts of vices
whatsoever: And now what more seasonable council can there be to all sorts of
men, then to try and examine all that they hear, to entertain nothing for the
opinion we have of the man, for the judgment is never so likely to be deluded
as when the person is too highly esteemed, to see likewise in how many respects
the Clergyman is bound to make the Puritan odious to the Protestant, and how
greatly disadvantagious that is to the work, all honest men are bound in
conscience to further, and likewise to conclude those Clergy men disaffected
that shall hereafter endeavor it, and to let both them and others in authority
know it, to be firm in their affections to the Puritan, past all their
subtilties to disunite them, that so all honest men being heartily united, the
greater may be their force, and the kingdoms enemies the speedier subdued: the
Puritan, Sectary, Brownist, and Anabaptists.

The Ministers under pretense of railing against, do scandalize and defame all
the honest men of the Kingdom, yea even of the Parliament themselves: so that
if we be not the more cautious we may be so far deluded, as to disesteeme
even their actions, not for that to any reasonable discreet man they can
appear to be any other then as the actions of the most wise should be, but
because they are approved of by the honest Puritan: It is not safe they think
to rave against the Parliament point blanke, they would then indeed appear so
palpably malicious and villanously disaffected, that men would have much ado
to tarry their trial by Law without doing present execution on them: and
therefore like men full of subtlety, they wound the Parliament through the
Puritans sides and therein take so vast a liberty, that almost provokes an
honest hearted man beyond his patience; sometimes they speak in a doubtful
sense, so as that all who are misled by them can understand them, and yet they
think that if they should be questioned, as out of guilt of conscience they
cannot be expect if they shall be able to give such an interpretation to their
words, that thereby they can delude the holdfast of Law and the censure of
justice: thus they provide an excuse before they act their villainy, and proceed
as far as they imagine that will bear them out; what high time it is that
these men should be crushed, least in time they sow so many tares in the
hearts of men; that no wisdom of man shall be able to pluck up, but that
they choke even the seeds of good doctrine, and root out of our minds the very
principles of reason: Another villainous work they have in hand, is to take
away our courages and dull our resolutions by commending peace unto us, when we
are necessitated to take up our Swords; what fools they imagine us to be, as
if we did not know what were the sweets of peace, but then it must be
accompanied with liberty, the bondsman is at peace; there is peace, there is
peace in a dungeon, yet I think no man can be heartily in love with such
kind of peace, no certainly, if our liberty and our religion be much dearer to
us then our lives, as I think they are to every wise man, then sure they must
be dearer to us then our rest, our swords are drawn for them, and so long as
they are violated, what peace? what peace? so long as the insolences and
conspiracies of unjust men, and their usurpations are so many? what peace? so
long as those that would free us from former oppressions, and would provide for
our future liberties, are in no safety but in continual hazard of their lives?
were we not necessitated to it, it were madness to think we could take
pleasure in shedding of our own bloods: what shallow men do they imagine us
to be, that think, that though their sweet words, and smooth faces, we do not
see their foul and mischievous intentions: yes to their grief of heart and
they joy of all good men they behold that, notwithstanding they have in many
other things deluded us, in this they have not; the Militia is settled in safe
and trusty hands, the Forts and strong holds made good, (...) Navy secured and
commanded by a faithful and courageous (...) of his country, that a strong and
a welfurnished Army is a (...) the terror of wicked men and we hope to the
suppression: they are quite frustrate of their ends, all their cunning
discourses and subtle motions for peace, though delivered with never so much
pretended piety, and seeming love to our safeties, come short of their purpose,
they have not thereby lulled us asleep, and (...) us to secure, no, we have
the courages of men, of valiant provoked men upon us, provokt by an insight
into all our injuries, which are now fresh in our memories, provoked by
discovery of their delusions, and animated by the amiable sight of liberty
which we may now if we will our selves obtain, of which for many years we
have been deprived: and therefore it is not good nor honest that they continue
their invitations to peace, so long as the Parliament see it needful to
provide for war This it is when they will be overwise and pass the bounds of
their office, nor are they more mistaken in this, then in other matters,
especially when they plead the Kings cause, their engagements and flatteries
here make them stark blind, and let them not see how under stickling for the
Kings prerogative they comprehend under that such things, the obtaining whereof
if duly considered would make his Majesty's office the most hazardous, and
fraught with least content of any one in the Kingdom. A negative voice they
much stand for, a power of calling and likewise of disolving Parliaments; these
things because they carry power with them, and see me to add much greatness
and high prerogative to the King, they stickling for them, and see not that if
the King should have them, he would be thereby ever liable to the blame, and
censures of the people; for if any thing should be consulted of by the
Parliament, and by them concluded to be safe and necessary for the Kingdom,
and that the King by that power they claim for him, should cross it if the
people should in the time to come by necessity for the want of what the
Parliament would have provided for them, and the King would not, whom have they
then to blame but the King: and he likewise must of necessity lie under their
hard opinions, should the neglect of calling Parliaments bring oppressions upon
the people: or the too soon dissolving them without consent of the House
before their business were ully dispatched. Both which in their book of Canons
and constitutions ecclesiastical, where without once mentioning the
Parliament, they take liberty to make the Kings Prerogatives what they please,
there I say have they peremptorily concluded the power of calling and
dissolving all assemblies to be the Kings undoubted right, and would likewise
have possessed the people so by the quarterly reading of those decrees of theirs
in Churches by their own order: It is true indeed these commons are most
justly damned by the Parliament, but by the remembrance hereof we may palpably
observe, what a power they then usurpt to themselves, and how notoriously they
abused that power to the prejudice of the King, his perpetual hazard and
disquiet: The King past all question saw all this when he so willingly assented
to those two acts for the constant calling of Parliment, and not dissolution of
this, both which the Clergy had no other means to disanull and make of no
effect, then by infusing into his Majesty's ears, and insinuating to the
people, that the King has a negative voice by which all that the Parliament
shall do comes to nothing, unless it pleases the King to assent, which is not
like to be but when those that are so powerful (his evil counselors) over
him shall give way to; by which means alone those evil men have a power of
crossing and making void all the debates and conclusions of the Parliament, and
though this be in effect to make the safety and freedom of the people to
depend upon one man's will and understanding, an absurdity in government; a man
would think these men could not have the impudence to plead for, much less
that the people should be so unadvised as to admit it to enter their thoughts
as a thing just and reasonable, yet indeed so impudent are those as to plead
for it, and so ignoran, are the people, as to admit it, which is the ground and
occasion of all the evils and mischiefs which at this day threaten both his
Majesty and the whole people. So that we see the King has little to thank
them for their too hasty forwardness in clayming what is so unsafe for him,
and so likely to divide the affections of the people from him: But what care
they, the King getting power, they get advancement, credit, honor, and what
not? so little respect they what is safe for him or prejudicial to the people,
so their own ends be served; there comes no harm from good consideration,
the advice then cannot be amiss, to wish every one to consider what they
hear, to examine all not timorously, nor prejudicially, but impartially by
that incorrupt rules of reason, and to give no credit to what is spoken for the
credit or estimation of the speaker, but because it is the truth, and nothing
but the truth.

FINIS.
