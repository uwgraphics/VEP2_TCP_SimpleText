A New-yeers Gift FOR THE PARLIAMENT AND ARMY: SHOWING, What the KINGLY Power
is; And that the CAUSE of those They call DIGGERS Is the life and marrow of
that Cause the Parliament has Declared for, and the Army Fought for; The
perfecting of which Work, will prove England to be the first of Nations, or the
tenth part of the city Babylon, that falls off from the Beast first, and that
sets the Crown upon Christ's head, to govern the World in Righteousness:

By Jerrard Winstanley a lover of Englands freedom and Peace.

Die Pride and Envy; Flesh, take the poor's advice.
Covetousness be gone: Come, Truth and Love arise.
Patience take the Crown; throw Anger out of doors:
Cast out Hypocrisy and Lust, which follows whores:
Then England sit in rest; Thy sorrows will have end;
Thy Sons will live in peace, and each will be a friend.
London, Printed for Giles Calvert, 1650.

A New years Gift SENT TO THE PARLIAMENT AND ARMY.
GEntlemen of the Parliament and Army; you and the Common people have assisted
each other, to cast out the Head of oppression which was Kingly power, seated
in one man's hand, and that work is now done, and till that work was done you
called upon the people to assist you to deliver this distressed bleeding dying
nation out of bondage; And the people came and failed you not, counting neither
purse nor blood too dear to part with to effect this work.

The Parliament after this have made an Act to cast out Kingly power, and to
make England a free Commonwealth. These Acts the People are much rejoiced
with, as being words forerunning their freedom, and they wait for their
accomplishment that their joy may be full; for as words without action are a
cheat, and kills the comfort of a righteous spirit, so words performed in
action does comfort and nourish the life thereof.

Now Sirs, wheresoever we spy out Kingly power, no man I hope shall be
troubled to declare it, nor afraid to cast it out, having both Act of
Parliament, the Soldiers Oath, and the common peoples consent on his side; for
Kingly power is like a great spread tree, if you lop the head or top-bow, and
let the other Branches and root stand, it will grow again and recover fresher
strength.

If any ask me, What Kingly power is? I Answer, there is a twofold Kingly
power. The one is, The Kingly power of righteousness, and this is the power of
Almighty God, ruling the whole creation in peace, and keeping it together. And
this is the power of universal love, leading people into all truth, teaching
every one to do as he would be done unto. Now once more striving with flesh
and blood, shaking down every thing that cannot stand, and bringing every one
into the Unity of himself, the one Spirit of love and righteousness, and so
will work a through restoration. But this Kingly power is above all, and will
tread all covetousness, pride, envy, and self-love, and all other enemies
whatsoever, under his feet, and take the kingdom and government of the Creation
out of the hand of self-seeking and self-honouring Flesh, and rule the alone
King of Righteousness in the earth; and this indeed is Christ himself, who will
cast out the curse; But this is not that Kingly power intended by that Act of
Parliament to be cast out, but pretended to be set up, though this Kingly power
be much fought against both by Parliament, Army, Clergy, and people; but when
they are made to see him, then they shall mourn, because they have persecuted
him.

But the other Kingly power, is the power of untighteousness, which indeed is
the Devil; And O that there were such a heart in Parliament and Army, as to
perform your own Act; then People would never complain of you for breach of
Covenant, for your Covetousness, Pride, and too much Selfseeking that is in
you. And you on the other-side would never have cause to complain of the
Peoples murmurings against you. Truly this jarring that is between you and the
People is, The Kingly Power; yea that very Kingly power which you have made an
Act to cast out; therefore see it be fulfilled on your part; for the Kingly
power of Righteousness expects it, or else he will cast you out for Hypocrites
and unsavory Salt; for he looks upon all your Actions, and truly, there is
abundance of Rust about your Actings, which makes them that they do not shine
bright

This Kingly power, is covetousness in his branches, or the power of self-love,
ruling in one or in many men over others, and enslaving those who in the
Creation are their equals; nay, who are in the strictness of equity rather
their Masters: And this Kingly power is usually set in the Chair of Government,
under the name of Prerogative, when he rules in one, over other: And under the
name of State Privilege of Parliament, when he rules in many over others: and
this Kingly power, is always raised up, and established by the Sword, and
therefore he is called the Murderer, or the great red Dragon, which fights
against Michael, for he enslaves the weakness of the People under him, denying
an equal freedom in the Earth to every one, which the Law of Righteousness gave
every man in his creation. This I say is Kingly power under darkness, and as he
rules in men, so he makes men jar one against another, and is the cause of all
Wars and Complainings; he is known by his outward actions, and his action at
this very day fills all places; for this power of darkness rules, and would
rule, and is that only Enemy that fights against Creation and National Freedom:
And this Kingly power is he, which you have made an Act of Parliament to cast
out. And now you Rulers of England, play the men, and be valiant for the Truth,
which is Christ: for assure your selves God will not be mocked, nor the Devil
will not be mocked; for First you say and profess you own the Scriptures of
Prophets and Apostles, and God looks that you should perform that Word in
action: Secondly you have Declared against the Devil, and if you do not now go
through with your work, but slack your hand by hypocritical self-love, and so
suffer this dark Kingly power to rise higher and Rule, you shall find, he will
maule both you, and yours to purpose.

The life of this dark Kingly power, which you have made an Act of Parliament
and Oath to cast out, if you search it to the bottom, you shall see it lies
within the iron chest of cursed Covetousness, who gives the Earth to some part
of mankind, and denies it to another part of mankind: and that part that has
the Earth, has no right frow the Law of creation to take it to himself, and
shut out others; but he took it away violently by Theft and Murder in Conquest:
As when our Norman William came into England and conquered, he turned the
English out, and gave the Land unto his Norman Soldiers every man his parcel
to enclose, and hence rose up Propriety; for this is the fruit of War from the
beginning, for it removes Propriety out of a weaker into a stronger hand, but
still upholds the curse of Bondage; and hereby the Kingly power which you have
made an Act, and Sworn to cast out, does remove himself from one chair to
another; and so long as the Sword rules over brethren, (mind what I say) so
long the Kingly power of darkness Rules, and so large as yet is his Kingdom;
which spreds from Sea to Sea, and fills the Earth; but Christ is rising who
will take the Dominion and Kingdom out of his hand, and his power of
Righteousness shall rise and spread from East to West, from North to South, and
fill the Earth with himself, and cast the other cursed power out, when
Coveteousness sheaths his Sword, and ceases to rage in the field; he first
makes sharp Laws of Bondage. That those that are conquered, and that by him are
appointed not to enjoy the Earth, but are turned out, shall be Servants,
Slaves, and Vassals to the Conquerers party: so those Laws that upholds Whips,
Prisons, Gallows is but the same power of the Sword that raged, and that was
drunk with Blood in the field.

King Charles, it is true, was the Head of this Kingly power in England, and he
Reigned as he was a Successor of the last Norman Conqueror: and whosoever you
be, that has Propriety of Land, has your Titles and Evidences made to you in
his or his Ancestors Name, and from his and their Will and Kingly power; I am
sure, he was not our Creator, and therefore parcelled out the Earth to some,
and denied it to others, therefore he must needs stand as a Conqueror, and was
the Head of this Kingly power, that burdens and oppresses the People, and that
is the cause of all our Wars and Divisions; for if this Kingly power of
Covetousness, which is the unrighteous Divider, did not yet Rule: both
Parliament, Army, and rich People, would cheerfully give consent that those we
call Poor should Dig and freely Plant the Waste and Common Land for a
livelihood, seeing there is Land enough, and more by half then is made use of,
and not be suffered to perish for want. And yet O ye Rulers of England, you
make a blazing profession, That you know, and that you own God, Christ, and the
Scriptures: but did Christ ever declare such hardness of heart? did not he bid
the rich man go and sell all that he has and give to the Poor? and does not
the Scripture say, If thou make a Covenant, keep it, though it be to thy
loss: But truly it will not be to your loss, to let your fellow Creatures, your
equals in the Creation, nay those that have been faithful in your Cause, and so
your Friends; I say it will not be to your loss to let them quietly improve the
Waste and Common Land, that they may live in peace, freed from the heavy
burdens of Poverty; for hereby our own Land will be increased with all sorts of
Commodities, and the People will be knit together in love, to keep out a
foreign Enemy that endeavors, and that will endeavor as yet, to come like an
Army of cursed Ratts and Mice to destroy our inheritance; so that if this
Freedom be quietly granted to us, you grant it but to your selves, to
Englishmen, to your own flesh and blood: and you do but give us our own
neither, which Covetousness, in the Kingly power has, and yet does hold from
us; for the Earth in the first Creation of it, was freely given to whole
mankind, without respect of Persons; therefore you Lords of Manors, and you
Rulers of England, if you own God, Christ and Scripture, now make Restitution,
and deliver us quiet possession of our Land, which the Kingly power as yet
holds from us.

While this Kingly power reigned in one man called Charles, all sorts of people
complained of oppression, both Gentry and Common people, because their lands,
Enclosures, and Copieholds were entangled, and because their Trades were
destroyed by Monopolizing Patentees, and your troubles were that you could not
live free from oppression in the earth: Thereupon you that were the Gentry,
when you were assembled in Parliament, you called upon the poor Common People
to come and help you, and cast out oppression; and you that complained are
helped and freed, and that top-bow is lopped off the tree of Tyranny, and
Kingly power in that one particular is cast out; but alas oppression is a great
tree still, and keeps off the son of freedom from the poor Commons still, he
has many branches and great roots which must be grub'd up, before every one
can sing Sions songs in peace.

As we spy out Kingly power we must declare it, and cast it out, or else we
shall deny the Parliament of England and their Acts, and so prove Traitors to
the Land, by denying obedience thereunto. Now there are Three Branches more of
Kingly power greater then the former that oppresses this Land wonderfully; and
these are the power of the Tithing Priests over the Tenths of our labors; and
the power of Lords of Manors, holding the free use of the Commons, and wast
Land from the poor, and the intolerable oppression either of bad Laws, or of
bad Judges corrupting good Laws; these are branches of the Norman conquest and
Kingly power still, and wants a Reformation.

For as for the first, William the Couqueror promised, That if the Clergy
would preach him up, so that the people might be bewitched, so as to receive
him to be Gods Anointed over them, he would give them the Tenths of the Lands
increase yearly; and they did it, and he made good his Promise; and do we not
yet see, That if the Clergy can get Tithes or Money, they will turn as the
Ruling power turns, any way; to Popery, to Protestanisme; for a King, against a
King, for Monarchy, for State-Government; they cry who bids most wages, they
will be on the strongest side, for an Earthly maintenance; yea, and when they
are lifted up, they would Rule too, because they are called Spiritual men: It
is true indeed, they are spiritual; but it is of the spiritual power of
Coveteousness and Pride; for the spiritual power of Love and Righteousness they
know not; for if they knew it, they would not persecute and rail against him
as ^hey do.

The Clergy will serve on any side, like our ancient Laws, that will serve any
Master: They will serve the Papists, they will serve the Protestants, they will
serve the King, they will serve the States; they are one and the same Tools for
Lawyers to work with under any Government. O you Parliament Men of England,
cast those whorish Laws out of doors, that are so Common, that pretend love to
every one, and is faithful to none; for truly, he that goes to Law, as the
Proverb is, shall die a Beggar: so that old Whores, and old Laws, picks men's
pockets, and undoes them: If the fault lie in the Laws, and much does, burn all
your old Law Books in Cheapside, and set up a Government upon your own
Foundation: do not put new Wine into old Bottles; but as your Government must
be new, so let the Laws be new, or else you will run farther into the Mud,
where you stick already, as though you were fast in an Irish Bogge; for you are
so far sunk, that he must have good eyes that can see where you are: but yet
all are not blind, there are eyes that sees you: but if the fault lies in the
Judges of the Law, surely such men deserve no power in a Reforming
Commonwealth, that burdens all sorts of People.

And truly I Will tell you plain, your Two Acts of Parliament are excellent and
Righteous: The One to cast out Kingly power; The Other to make England a Free
Commonwealth: build upon these Two, it is a firm Foundation, and your House
will be the glory of the World; and I am confident, the righteous Spirit will
love you: do not stick in the Bogge of covetousness; Let not self-love so
be-muddy your brain, that you should lose your selves in the thicket of bramble
bush-words, and set never a strong Oak of some stable Action for the Freedom
of the poor Oppressed that helped you when you complained of Oppression. Let
not Pride blind your eyes, that you should forget you are the Nations Servants,
and so prove Solomon's words good in your selves, That Servants ride on
Horseback and Coache^, when as Princes, such as Chose you, and set you there,
go on foot: and many of them, through their love to the Nation, have so wasted
themselves, that now they can hardly get Bread, but with great difficulty. I
tell you this is a sore Evil, and this is truth; therefore think upon it, it is
a poor man's Advice, and you shall find weight in it, if you Do as well as Say.

Then Secondly for Lords of Manors, They were William the Conquerors Colonels
and Favorites, and he gave a large circuit of Land to every one, called A
Lord-ship, that they might have a watchful eye, that if any of the conquered
English should begin to Plant themselves upon any Common or waste Land, to live
out of sight or out of slavery, that then some Lord of Manor or other might
see and know of it, and drive them off, as these Lords of Manors now a days,
endeavors to drive off the Diggers from Digging upon the Commons; but we
expect the Rulers of the Land will grant unto us their Friends, the benefit of
their own Acts against Kingly power, and not suffer that Norman power to crush
the poor Oppressed, who helped them in their straits, nor suffer that Norman
power to bud fresher out, and so in time may come to overtop our deer bought
Freedom more then ever.

Search all your Laws, and I Will adventure my life, for I have little else to
lose, That all Lords of Manors hold Title to the Commons by no stronger hold
then the Kings Will, whose Head is cut off; and the King held Title as he was a
Conqueror; now if you cast off the King who was the Head of that power, surely
the power of Lords of Manors is the same; therefore perform your own Act of
Parliament, and cast out that part of the Kingly power likewise, that the
People may see you understand what you Say and Do, and that you are faithful.

For truly the Kingly power reigns strongly in the Lords of Manors over the
Poor; for my own particular, I have in other Writings as well as in this,
Declared my Reasons, That the common Land is the poor Peoples Propriety, and I
have Dug upon the Commons, and I hope in time to obtain the Freedom, to get
Food and Raiment therefrom by righteous labor, which is all I desire; and for
so doing, the supposed Lord of that Manor has Arrested me twice; First, in an
Action of 20 l. Trespass for Plowing upon the Commons, which I never did* and
because they would not suffer me to Plead my own Cause, they made shift to pass
a Sentence of Execution against some Cows I kept, supposing they had been mine,
and took them away; but the right Owner reprieved them, and fetched the Cowes
back; so greedy are these Thieves and Murderers after my life for speaking the
truth, and for maintaining the Life and Marrow of the Parliaments Cause in my
Actions.

And now they have Arrested me again in an Action of 4. l. trespass for digging
upon the Commons, which I did, and own the work to be righteous, and no trespass
to any: This was the Attorney of Kingstone's Advice, either to get Money on
both sides, for they love Money as deerly as a poor man's dog do his breakfast in
a cold morning (but regard not justice) or else, That I should not remove it to
a higher Court, but that the cause might be tried there, and then they know how
to please the Lords of Manors, that have resolved to spend hundreds of pounds
but they will hinder the poor from enjoying the Commons; for they will not
suffer me to plead my own Cause, but I must Fee an enemy, or else be condemned
and executed without mercy or Justice as I was before, and ^o to put me in
Prison till I pay their unrighteous Sentence; for truly Attourneys are such
neat workmen, that they can turn a Cause which way those that have the biggest
purse will have them: and the Country knows very well, That Kingstone court is
so full of the Kingly power; that some will rather lose their Rights, then
have their causes tried there: one of the Officers of that court, told a friend
of mine, That if the Diggers cause was good, he would pick out such a Jurie as
should overthrow him: And upon my former Arrest, they picked out such a Jurie
as Sentenced me to pay 10. l. damages for plowing upon the commons, which I did
not do, neither did any witness prove it before them: So that from Kingstone
Juries, Lords of Manors, and Kingly power, Good Lord deliver us.

Do these men obey the Parliaments Acts, to throw down Kingly power? O no: The
same unrighteous doing that was complained of in King Charles days, the same
doings is among them still: Moneys will buy and sell Justice still: and is our
8 years Wars come round about to lay us down again in the kennel of injustice
as much or more then before? are we no farther learned yet? O ye Rulers of
England, when must we turn over a new leaf? will you always hold us in one
Lesson? surely you will make Dunces of us; then all the Boys in other Lands
will laugh at us: come, I pray let us take forth, and go forward in our
learning.

You blame us who are the Common people as though we would have no government;
truly Gentlemen, We desire a righteous government with all our hearts, but the
government we have gives freedom and livelihood to the Gentry, to hae
abundance, and to lock up Treasures of the Earth from the poor, so that rich
men may have chests full of Gold and Silver, and houses full of Corn and Goods
to look upon; and the poor that works to get it, can hardly live, and if they
cannot work like Slaves, then they must starve. And thus the Law gives all the
Land to some part of mankind whose Predecessors got it by conquest, and denies
it to others, who by the righteous Law of Creation may claim an equal portion;
and yet you say this is a righteous government, but surely it is no other but
self-ishnes, which is the great Red Dragon, the Murderer.

England is a Prison; the variety of subtilties in the Laws preserved by the
Sword, are bolts, bars, and doors of the prison; the Lawyers are the Jaylors,
and poor men are the prisoners; for let a man fall into the hands of any from
the Bailiffe to the Judge, and he is either undone, or weary of his life.

Surely this power the Laws, which is the great Idol that people dote upon, is
the burden of the Creation, a Nurserie of Idleness, luxury, and cheating, the
only enemy of Christ the King of righteousness; for though it pretend Justice,
yet the Judges and Law-Officers, buy and sell Justice for money, and wipes
their mouths like Solomon's whore, and says it is my calling, and never are
troubled at it.

Two things must cast out this Idol: First, Let not people send their children
to those Nurseries of Covetousness, The Innes of Court. Secondly, let not
people live in contention, but fulfill Christ's last commandment, Love; and
endeavor to practice that full point of the Law and the Prophets, Do as you
would be done by, and so cast out envy and discontent. Woe to you Lawyers, for
your trade is the bane and misery of the world; your power is the only power
that hinders Christ from rising; the destruction of your power will be the life
of the World; it is full of confusion, it is Babylon, and surely its fall is
near, in regard the light of truth is rising, who will consume your power, but
save your persons by the words of his mouth, and brightness of his coming.

The Lawyers trade is one of the false Prophets, that says, Lo here is Christ,
I Will save you in this Court, and lo there is Christ, I Will save you in that Court:
but when we have tried all, we are lost, and not saved, for we are either
utterly made Beggars by this Savior, the Law, or else we are nursed up in
hardness of heart and cruelty against our fellow creature whom we ought to
love and preserve, and not destroy: This Savior jeeres righteousness, and bids
every man save himself, and never regard what becomes of another, and so is a
plain destroyer of the Creation; Surely that Woe pronounced against Lawyers by
the Man Christ must be fulfilled, delay is no payment: Therefore you Parliament
and Army that have power in your hands, reform the Law; and suffer none to be
called to practice Law but reformed ones; nay suffer every man to plead his own
cause, and choose his own Lawyer, where he finds the most ingenuous man: Well,
every man's burden in this Age fills their mouths with words of Lamentation
against Law and Lawyers sufficiently; therefore you that have an opportunity
to ease the cry of the oppressed, shut not your eyes and ears, but cast out
this covetous corruption whereby corrupt Lawyers do oppress the People; it is
another Branch of the Kingly power.

You Gentlemen of Surrey, and Lords of Manors, and you Mr Parson Platt
especially, that lay almost a fortnight waiting and tempting the Lord Fairfax
to send Soldiers to drive off the Diggers; when he granted your Desire, it was
but to secure the Shereiff, for he did not give them commission to beat us,
which we thank him for; and we thank the Soldiers for their moderation, that
they would not st^^^ poor worms, Englands and the creations faithful friend^,
though you would have moved them thereunto. My Advice to you Gentlemen is this,
Hereafter to lie still and cherish the Diggers, for they love you, and would
not have your finger ache if they could help it, and why should you be so bitter
against them? O let them live by you, some of them have been Soldiers, and
some country men that were always friends to the Parliaments cause, by whose
hardship and means you enjoy the creatures about you in peace; and will you
now destroy part of them that have preserved your lives? O do not do so; be not
so besotted with the Kingly power; hereafter let not the Attourneyes or
Lawyers neatly council your Money out of your purses, and stir you up to beat
and abuse the Diggers, to make all rational men laugh at your folly, and
condemn you for your bitterness: If you have yet so much Money, give it not
away to destroy men, but give it to some poor or other to be a Stock, and bid
them go and Plant the common; this will be your honor, and your comfort;
assure your selves you never must have true comfort tell you be friends with
the poor; therefore come, come, love the Diggers, and make restitution of their
Land you hold from them, for what would you do if you had not such laboring
men to work for you?

And you great Officers of the Army and Parliament, love your common Soldiers,
(I plead for Equity and Reason) and do not force them by long delay of Payment
to sell you their deer bought Debenters for a thing of naught, and then to go
and buy our common Land, and crown Land, and other Land that is the spoil one
of another, therewith: Remember you are Servants to the commons of England, and
you were Volunteers in the Wars, and the common people have paid you for your
pains so largely, that some of us have not left our selves hardly bread to
eat; and therefore if there be a spoil to be gathered of crown Lands, Deans,
Bishops, Forests Lands and commons, that is to come to the poor commons
freely; and you ought to be content with your wages, unless you will deny
Christ and the Scriptures; and you ought not to go and buy one of another that
which is common to all the Nation; for you ought neither to buy nor sell other
men's Propriety by the Law of creation; for Christ gives you no such Warrant.
As soon as you have freed the Earth from one intanglement of Kingly power,
will you entangle it more, and worse by another degree of Kingly power? I pray
consider what you do, and do righteously: We that are the poor commons, that
paid our Money, and gave you free Quarter, have as much Right in those crown
Lands and Lands of the spoil as you; therefore we give no consent That you
should buy and sell our crown Lands and waste Lands, for it is our purchased
inheritance from under Oppression, it is our own, even the poor common peoples
of England: It was taken from us, and has been held from us by former
conquests, whereof the Norman conquest was the last, which is cast out by yours
and our joint Assistance; therefore you cannot in Equity take it from us, nor
we cannot in Equity take it from you, for it is our joint purchased
inheritance; we paid you your wages to help us to recover it, but not to take
it to your selves, and turn us out, and buy and sell it among your selves; for
this is a cheat of the Kingly swordlie power which you hold up; and we profess
to all the world, in so doing you deny God, Christ and the Scriptures whom ye
professed you own: for God, Christ, and Scriptures own no such practice:
Likewise we profess to all the Creation, That in so doing, you rob us of our
Rights; and you kill us, by denying to give us our livelihood in our own
inheritance freely, which is the crown Land and Common Land and waste Lands,
Bishops and Deans, which some of you begin to say you are not satisfied in your
conscience to let us have; I, well spoke, tender hearted Covetousness; if you
do so, you will uphold the Kingly power, and so disobey both Acts of
Parliament, and break your Oath, and you will live in the breach of those Two
Commandments, Thou shall not kill: Thou shall not steal; by denying us the
Earth which is our Livelihood, and thereby killing us by a lingering death.

Well, the end of all my Speech is to point out the Kingly power, where I spy
it out, and you see it remains strongly in the hands of Lords of Manors, who
have dealt discourteously with some who are sincere in heart, though there have
some come among the Diggers that have caused scandal, but we dis-own their
ways.

The Lords of Manors have sent to beat us, to pull down our houses, spoil our
labors; yet we are patient, and never offered any violence to them again, this
40 weeks past, but wait upon God with love till their hearts thereby be
softened; and all that we desire is, but to live quietly in the land of our
nativity, by our righteous labor, upon the common Land which is our own, but
as yet the Lords of the Manor so formerly called, will not suffer us, but
abuse us. Is not that part of the Kingly power? In that which follows I shall
clearly prove it is, for it appears so clear that the understanding of a child
does say, It is Tyranny, it is the Kingly power of darkness, therefore we
expect that you will grant us the benefit of your Act of Parliament that we may
say, Truly England is a Commonwealth, and a free people indeed.

Sirs, Though your Tithing Priests and others tell you, That we Diggers do deny
God, Christ, and the Scripture, to make us odious, and themselves better
thought of; yet you will see in time when the King of Righteousness whom we
serve does clear our innnocencie, That our actions and conversation is the very
life of the Scripture, and holds forth the true power of God and Christ. For is
not the end of all preaching, praying, and profession wrapped up in this
action, (namely, Love your enemies, and do to all men, as you would they
should do to you, for this is the very Law and the Prophets. This is the New
Commandment that Christ left behind him. Now if any seem to say this, and does
not do this, but acts contrary, for my part I own not their ways, they are
members that uphold the curse.

Bare talking of righteousness, and not acting, has ruled, and yet does rule
king of darkness in the creation; and it is the cause of all this immoderate
confusion and ignorance that is in men.

But the actings of righteousness from the inward power of love, shall rule
King of righteousness in the creation now in these later days, and cast the
other Serpent and fiery Scorpion out; for this is Christ the restoring power:
and as he rises up, so multitude of words without action (which is hypocrisy)
is to die, his judgment hastens apace.

If any sort of people hold the earth to themselves by the dark Kingly power,
and shut out others from that freedom, they deny God, Christ, and Scriptures,
and they overthrow all their preaching, praying, and profession; for the
Scriptures declare them to be Hypocrites, Scribes and Pharisees, that say, and
do not; they have words, and no deeds: Like Parson Platt the Preacher at
Horsley in Surrey, a Lord of Manor (by marriage) of the place where we digg,
who caused a poor old man's house that stood upon the Common, to be pulled down
in the evening of a cold day, and turned the old man, and his wife, and
daughter to lie in the open field, because he was a Digger: and he, and other
Lords of Manors, and Gentlemen sent their servants up and down the Town, to
bid their Tenants and neighbors, neither to give the Diggers lodging nor
victuals, on pain of their displeasure. Though this Parson Platt preach the
Scriptures, yet I Will affirm, he denies God, Christ, and Scriptures, and knows
nothing of them; for covetousness, pride, and envy has blinded his eyes. A
man knows no more of righteousness than he has power to act; and surely, this
cruelty of preaching Platt is an unrighteous act.

If the Diggers were enemies, (oh you Lords of Manors) as they are not, you
ought to love them: I am sure, they love you; and if you doubt it, put them to
the trial; you shall find them more faithful than many of those pick-thank
slaves, and belly-god servants to whom your ears are open, when they bring
tales full of envy to you against us.

We are told likewise, That to make us who are called Diggers, odious, and to
incense you against us, there came to the General and Council of State,
diverse Justices, and others, and told you, that we Diggers were Cavaliers, and
that we waited an opportunity, and gathered together to stand up for the Prince.

But all that know us can prove that to be a false report, to the dishonor of
those Justices; for we have been friends to the Parliaments cause, and so do
continue, and will continue; for this work of digging, to make England a free
Commonwealth, is the life and marrow of the Parliaments cause. And the two
Acts of Parliament, the One, to cast out Kingly power, the Other, to make
England a free Commonwealth, declares it: and we do obey those Acts, and will
obey them, for they hold forth righteousness.

But for our rising in arms for the Prince, or any other, let any come and see
our strength and work, and they will say, It is a mere envious slander cast
upon us, to incense you against us.

Besides, You shall see by and by, That our principles are wholly against
Kingly power in every one, as well as in one. Likewise we hear, that they told
you, that the Diggers do steal and rob from others. This likewise is a slander:
we have things stolen from us; but if any can prove that any of us do steal
any man's proper goods, as Sheep, Geese, Pigs, as they say, let such be made a
spectacle to all the world: For my part, I own no such doing, neither do I know
any such thing by any of the Diggers. Likewise they report, that we Diggers
hold women to be common, and live in that bestialnesse: For my part, I declare
against it; I own this to be a truth, That the earth ought to be a common
Treasury to all; but as for women, Let every man have his own wife, and every
woman her own husband; and I know none of the Diggers that act in such an
unrationall excess of female community: If any should, I profess to have
nothing to do with such people, but leave them to their own Master, who will
pay them with torment of mind, and diseases in their bodies.

These and suchlike tales, we hear, are brought to you, to incense you against
us: but we desire you to mark them that bring them, for we partly know who they
be, and we can tell them to their faces, they were Cavaliers, and had hands in
the Kentish Rising, and in stirring up that offensive Surrey Petition, which
was the occasion of bloodshed in Westminster-yard, and they would rejoice to
see the Prince come in with an Army to overtop you: for we know, they love
you not but from the teeth outward, for their own ends: And these are the
proud Hamans, that would incense you against the Mordecaies of the Land, even
your true-hearted friends, the Diggers. Well, in the midst of our slanders we
rejoice in the uprightness of our hearts, and we do commit our cause to him
that judges righteously.

Upon these lying reports, and importunity to the General, it seems the
General granted the Lords of Manor to have some soldiers to go along with the
Sheriff, to pull down the Diggers houses; and so the soldiers did come: but
they were very moderate and rational men, and as they were sent to secure the
Sheriff, so they did: but there was no cause; for, though the Gentlemen
possessed the General, that they feared opposition from the Diggers, yet the
soldiers saw they lifted not up a finger in discontent, but fought against
those dragons, the Lords of Manors, with the spirit of love and patience: for
when the two Lords of Manor sat among the soldiers on horsback and coach, and
commanded their fearful tenants to pull down one of the Diggers houses before
their faces, and rejoiced with shouting at the fall; yet some of the Diggers
stood by, and were very cheerful, and preached the Gospel to those Turkish
Bashaws, which are words of life, and in time will prove words of terror, to
torment their awakened consciences.

And the poor tenants that pulled down the house, durst do no other, because
their Landlords and Lords looked on, for fear they should be turned out of
service, or their livings; as a a poor honest man, because he looked with a
cheerful countenance upon the Diggers (though he was afraid to come near, or
afraid to speak openly, lest his Landlords setting-dogs should smell the sound
of his words, and carry a pick-thank tale, which his Lords ears are much open
to) a Baily was sent presently to him, to warn him out of his house.

Can the Turkish Bashaws hold their slaves in more bondage than these
Gospel-professing Lords of Manors do their poor tenants? and is not this the
Kingly power? O you Rulers of England, I pay see that your own acts be obeyed,
and let the oppressed go free.

And when the poor enforced slaves had pulled down the house, then their Lords
gave them ten shillings to drink, and there they smiled one upon another; being
fearful, like a dog that is kept in awe, when his Master gives him a bone, and
stands over him with a whip; he will eat, and look up, and twinch his tail; for
they durst not laugh out, left their Lords should hear they jeered them openly;
for in their hearts they are Diggers. Therefore, you Lords of Manors, if you
have none to stand for you but whom you force by threatening, then leave off
striving against the spirit, and say you are fallen, and come in and embrace
righteousness, that you may find mercy betimes.

The next day after this, there came two soldiers and three Countrymen to
another house which the Diggers had set up, (which the Sheriff the day before
had let alone, for, as some say, he was grieved to see what was done,) one of
these soldiers was very civil, and walked lovingly with the Diggers round
their corn which they had planted, and commended the work, and would do no harm
(as diverse others were of the same mind) and when he went his way, gave the
Diggers 12 d. to drink: but the other soldier was so rude, that he forced
those three Countrymen to help him to pull down the house, and railed
bitterly: the men were unwilling to pull it down; but for fear of their
Landlords, and the threatening soldier, they did put their hands to pull it
down.

And seeing Parson Platt (the Lord of that Manor) will not suffer the Diggers
to have a house, (wherein he forgets his Master Christ, that is persecuted in
naked, hungry, and houselesse members) yet the Diggers were mighty cheerful,
and their spirits resolve to wait upon God, to see what he will do, and they
have built them some few little hutches like calf-cribs, and there they lie
anights, and follow their work adays still with wonderful joy of heart,
taking the spoiling of their goods cheerfully, counting it a great happiness
to be persecuted for righteousness sake, by the Priests and Professors, that
are the successors of Judas, and the bitter-spirited Pharisees that put the man
Christ Jesus to death. And they have planted diverse Acres of Wheat and Rye,
which is come up, and promises a very hopeful crop, committing their cause to
God, and wait upon him, saying, O thou King of righteousness, do thine own
work.

O that you would search and try our ways narrowly, and see whether we deny
God, Christ, Scriptures, as the Priests slander us we do; and you shall find,
that the Scriptures warrant our action, and God in Christ is the life of our
souls, and the support of our spirits in the midst of this our sharp
persecution from the hands of unreasonable men, who have not faith in Christ,
but uphold the Kingly power, which you have Voted down.

Likewise, you shall see, that we live in the performance of that work which is
the very life and marrow of the Parliaments Cause, whereby we honor the
Parliament and their Cause: as you shall see by this following Declaration,
unfolding the foundation whereupon Englands Laws are, or the Freedom of a
Commonwealth ought to be built, which is Equity and Reason.

IN the time of the Kings, who came in as Conquerors, and ruled by the power of
the Sword, not only the Common land, but the Enclosures also were captivated
under the will of those Kings, till now of late that our later Kings granted
more freedom to the Gentry than they had presently after the Conquest; yet
under bondage still: for what are prisons, whips and gallows in the times of
peace, but the laws and power of the sword, forcing and compelling obedience,
and so enslaving, as if the sword raged in the open field?

England was in such a slavery under the Kingly power, that both Gentry and
Commonaltie groaned under bondage; and to ease themselves, they endeavored to
call a Parliament, that by their counsels and decrees they might find some
freedom.

But Charles the then King perceiving that the Freedom they strove for, would
derogate from his Prerogative-tyranny, thereupon he goes into the North, to
raise a War against the Parliament, and took WILLIAM the Conqueror's Sword into
his hand again, thereby to keep under the former conquered English, and to
uphold his Kingly power of self-will and Prerogative, which was the power got
by former Conquests; that is, to rule over the lives and estates of all men at
his will, and so to make us pure slaves and vassals.

Well, This Parliament, that did consist of the chief Lords, Lords of Manors,
and Gentry, and they seeing that the King, by raising an Army, did thereby
declare his intent to enslave all sorts to him by the sword; and being in
distress, and in a low ebb, they call upon the common people to bring in their
Plate, Moneys, Taxes, Free Quarter, Excise, and to adventure their lives with
them, and they would endeavor to recover England from that Norman yoke, and
make us a free people: and the common people assent hereunto, and call this the
Parliaments Cause, and own it, and adventure person and purse to preserve it;
and by the joint assistance of Parliament and People, the King was beaten in
the field, his head taken off, and his Kingly power voted down; and we the
Commons thereby virtually have recovered our selves from the Norman Conquest,
we want nothing but possession of the spoil, which is a free use of the Land
for our livelihood.

And from hence we the common people, or younger brothers, plead our propriety
in the Common land, as truly our own by virtue of this victory over the King;
as our elder brothers can plead propriety in their Enclosures; and that for
three reasons in Englands law.

First, By a lawful purchase or contract between the Parliament and us; for
they were our Landlords and Lords of Manors that held the freedom of the
Commons from us, while the King was in his power; for they held title thereunto
from him, he being the head, and they branches of the Kingly power, that
enslaved the people by that ancient Conquerors Sword, that was the ruling
power: For they said, Come and help us against the King that enslaves us, that
we may be delivered from his Tyranny, and we will make you a free People.

Now they cannot make us free, unless they deliver us from the bondage which
they themselves held us under; and that is, they held the freedom of the Earth
from us: for we in part with them have delivered our selves from the King: now
we claim freedom from that bondage you have, and yet do hold us under, by the
bargain and contract between Parliament and us, who (I say) did consist of
Lords of Manors, and Landlords, whereof Mr. Drake, who has arrested me for
digging upon the Common, was one at that time: Therefore by the law of Bargain
and Sale, we claim of them our freedom, to live comfortably with them in this
Land of our Nativity; and this we cannot do, so long as we lie under poverty,
and must not be suffered to plant the commons and waste land for our
livelihood: for, take away the land from any people, and those people are in a
way of continual death and misery; and better not to have had a body, than not
to have food and raiment for it. But (I say) they have sold us our freedom in
the common, and have been largely paid for it; for by means of our bloods and
money, they sit in peace: for if the King had prevailed, they had lost all, and
been in slavery to the meanest Cavalier, if the King would. Therefore we the
Commons say, Give us our bargain: if you deny us our bargain, you deny God,
Christ, and Scriptures; and all your profession then is and has been
hypocrisy.

Secondly, The Commons and Crown land is our propriety by equal conquest over
the Kingly power: for the Parl did never stir up the people by promises and
covenant to assist them to cast out the King, and to establish them in the
Kings place and prerogative power: No, but all their Declarations were for the
safety and peace of the whole Nation.

Therefore the common people being part of the Nation, and especially they that
bore the greatest heat of the day in casting out the oppressor: and the Nation
cannot be in peace, so long as the poor oppressed are in wants, and the land is
entangled and held from them by bondage.

But the Victory being obtained over the King, the spoil which is properly the
Land, ought in equity to be divided now between the two Parties, that is,
Parliament and Common People. The Parliament, consisting of Lords of Manors,
and Gentry, ought to have their enclosure Lands free to them without
molestation, as they are freed from the Court of Wards.

And the Common People, consisting of Soldiers, and such as paid Taxes and
Free Quarter, ought to have the freedom of all waste and common land, and
Crown-land equally among them; the Soldiery ought not in equity to have all,
nor the other people that paid them to have all; but the spoil ought to be
divided between them that stayed at home, and them that went to War; for the
Victory is for the whole Nation.

And as the Parliament declared, they did all for the Nation, and not for
themselves only; so we plead with the Army, they did not fight for
themselves, but for the freedom of the Nation: and I say, we have bought our
Freedom of them likewise by Taxes and Free Quarter: therefore we claim an
equal Freedom with them in this Conquest over the King.

Thirdly, We claim an equal portion in the Victory over the King, by virtue of
the two Acts of Parliament, the One to make England a Free-Common-wealth; the
Other to take away Kingly power. Now the Kingly power (you have heard) is a
power that rules by the Sword in covetousness and self, giving the earth to
some, and denying it to others: and this Kingly power was not in the hand of
the King alone; but Lords, and Lords of Manors, and corrupt Judges, and Lawyers
especially, held it up likewise; for he was the head, and they, with the
Tything-priests are the branches of that Tyrannical Kingly power; and all the
several limbs and members must be cast out, before Kingly power can be pulled
up root and branch. Mistake me not, I do not say, Cast out the persons of men:
No, I do not desire their fingers to ache: but I say, Cast out their power,
whereby they hold the people in bondage, as the King held them in bondage. And
I say, it is our own Freedom we claim, both by bargain, and by equality in the
Conquest; as well as by the Law of righteous Creation, which gives the Earth to
all equally.

And the power of Lords of Manors lies in this: They deny the Common people
the use and free benefit of the Earth, unless they give them leave, and pay
them for it, either in Rent, in Fines, in Homages, or Heriots. Surely the Earth
was never made by God, that the Younger brother should not live in the Earth,
unless he would work for, and pay his Elder brother Rent for the Earth: No;
this Slavery came in by Conquest, and it is part of the Kingly power; and
England cannot be a Free Commonwealth, till this Bondage be taken away. You
have taken away the King; you have taken away the House of Lords: Now step two
steps further, and take away the power of Lords of Manors, and of Tything
Priests, and the intolerable oppressions of Judges, by whom Laws are corrupted;
and your work will be honorable.

Fourthly, if this Freedom be denied the Common people, To enjoy the Common
Land; then Parliament, Army and Judges will deny Equity and Reason, whereupon
the Laws of a well-governed Commonwealth ought to be built: And if this Equity
be denied, then there can be no Law, but Club-Law, among the people: and if the
Sword must reign, then every Party will be striving to bear the Sword; and then
farewell Peace; nay, farewell Religion and Gospel, unless it be made use of to
entrap one another, as we plainly see some Priests and others make it a Cloak
for their Knavery. If I adventure my life, and fruit of my labor, equal with
you, and obtain what we strive for: it is both Equity and Reason, that I should
equally divide the Spoil with you, and not you to have all, and I none: And if
you deny us this, you take away our Propriety from us, our Moneys and Blood,
and give us nothing for it.

Therefore, I say, the Common Land is my own Land, equal with my
fellow-Commoners; and our true Propriety, by the Law of Creation: it is every
ones, but not one single ones: Yea, the Commons are as truly ours by the last
excellent two Acts of Parliament, the Foundation of Englands new righteous
Government aimed at, as the Elder brothers can say the Enclosures are theirs:
for they adventured their Lives, and covenanted with us to help them to
preserve their Freedom: And we adventured our lives, and they covenanted with
us, to purchase and to give us our Freedom, that has been hundreds of years
kept from us.

Daemona non Armis, sed Morte subegit Jesus.
By patient Sufferings, not by Death,
Christ did the Devil kill;
And by the same, still to this day,
his Foes he conquers still.
True Religion, and undefiled, is this, To make restitution of the Earth, which
has been taken and held from the Common people, by the power of Conquests
formerly, and so set the oppressed free. Do not All strive to enjoy the Land?
The Gentry strive for Land, the Clergy strive for Land, the Common people
strive for Land; and Buying and Selling is an Art, whereby people endeavor to
cheat one another of the Land. Now if any can prove, from the Law of
Righteousness, that the Land was made peculiar to him and his successively,
shutting others out, he shall enjoy it freely, for my part: But I affirm, It
was made for all; and true Religion is, To let every one enjoy it. Therefore,
you Rulers of England, make restitution of the Lands which the Kingly power
holds from us: Set the oppressed free; and come in, and honor Christ, who is
the Restoring Power, and you shall find rest.

The CURSE and BLESSING that is in MANKIND.
IN the beginning of Time, the Spirit of Universal Love appeared to be the
father of all things: The Creation of Fire, Water, Earth, and Air, came out of
him, and is his clothing Love is the Word.

The Creation is the House or Garden, in which this one Spirit has taken up
his seat, and in which he manifests himself: For if ever Love be seen or known,
he appears either in the inward feeling within your hearts, loving All with
tender love; or else appears toward you, from outward objects, as from other
Men, or other creatures.

There are two Earths, in which the Spirit of Love declares himself. First, the
Living Earth, called Mankind: this is the Creation, or the living soul. And
when this Spirit of universal Love rules King therein, this Earth is then in
peace, and is grown up to the perfection of a man anointed. But when Self or
Particular love rules, which is called the sin Covetousness, then this Earth is
brought into Bondage, and Sorrow fills all places. This is the dark side of the
Cloud, in which there is no true peace.

Secondly, in the great Body of Earth in which all creatures subsist, the
Spirit of Universal Love appears, to preserve his Creation in peace: for
Universal Love unites not only Mankind into an oneness, bnt unites all other
creatures into a sweet harmony of willingness to preserve Mankind. And this
Spirit of Love spread abroad, is the same Spirit of Love that is supreme in
Man: and this is the Righteous man.

But when Covetousness or Particular love began to work, then not only
Mankind was divided amongst themselves, but all creatures were divided, and
enmity rose up amongst them, setting one against another; and this power is the
wicked man: mark him where you see him, which is the Murderer, and must be cast
out.

Well, In the beginning, universal love appeared to be the father of al things,
(though self-love in our experience rules in man first) and as he made mankind
to be the Lord of the Earth, so he made the Earth to be a common Treasury of
livelihood to whole mankind without respect of persons; and for all other
creatures likewise that were to proceed from the Earth.

Mankind is the chief creature, and the Spirit of universal Love in his
branches, is the Lord of all the Earth; and this Spirit in man unfolds himself
in Light and Darkness: his face is called the universal power of Love: his back
parts is called the selvish power: or thus, the one is called the Son of
Bondage which causes shame, the other is called the Son of Freedom, which
brings peace and honor: these Two strive in the womb of the Earth which shall
come forth first; and which shall rule; the fleshy man, has got the start; but
the other will prove the stronger, and cast him out with honor.

While this Spirit of Lordship in the last day time of mankind, was universal
Love and Righteousness leading every single branch of mankind to do to another
as he would be done unto; then every thing was in peace, and there was a sweet
communion of Love in the creation: and as the Spirit was a common Treasury of
Unity and Peace within, so the Earth was a common Treasury of delight for the
preservation of their bodies without, so that there was nothing but peace upon
the face of the whole Earth.

This was man's estate, before the fall or the day time of mankind; for since
the time that our Bibles speak of Adam to this day, is about 6000 years; and
this time has been the night time of mankind: and Esays time was about
midnight when in one of his words he cries, Watchman, What of the night?
Watchman, What of the night? the seventh thousand year which is now dawning,
will be the rising of the Son of universal Love again, and of the dispersing of
the night or darkness; for as the night and day Sun and Moon has their
exchanges, so has these Two powers, called Sons of God in mankind; and in this
age wherein we now live, is the expiring of the selvish power, and the rising
up of the Blessing which has been spoke of in all ages, but now appearing like
lightning from east to west, casting out the Mystery of Iniquity, or self
power, by the word of his mouth, and by the brightness of his coming, and so
bringing peace.

So that, as there is the power of Light, which is universal Love, called the
Blessing which brings Peace; so there is the power of Darkness, which is
particular or self love, and this is called the Curse, for it brings sorrow and
while this rules King in the Earth, as it does at this day visibly through the
whole Earth, few are saved, that is, few enter into rest and peace; for this
power has filled all places, with his stinking self seeking Government, and
troubles every body.

As there is light and darkness, day and night, clouds and cleerness moving
upon the face of the great Earth; and as there is Earth and Waters in the great
World which runs round; so mankind is called sometimes Earth, sometimes Waters;
and as the Sun in the skies moves upon the great Earth and makes that fruitful
which seemed dead, while the Sun is under the dark cloudy winter quarter:

Even so the Son of universal Love, who is the Spirit and power of universal
Freedom, he moves upon the living waters mankind, and makes him, who all the
dark time past was a Chaos of confusion, lying under Types, Shadows,
Ceremonies, Forms, Customs, Ordinances, and heaps of waste words, under which
the Spirit of Truth lay buried, now to enlighten, to worship in Spirit and
Truth, and to bring forth fruit of Righteousness in action.

In our present experience, The darkness or self love goes before; and light
or universal love follows after; the flesh runs hasty and quick, and loses
himself in unrational excessive action; the true Spirit comes slowly after, and
takes the Crown.

Darkness and Bondage, does oppress Liberty and Light; and the power of
universal Love appears most sweet and full of glory, when the power of self
Love or Covetousness has tortured the Creation (mankind) with bitter Tyranny:
for this is the Dragon or Murderer that must be cast out; before the Creation
(man) can sing Haelelujah in peace.

So then you may see, That the innocence, light, and purity of mankind is this,
when the Spirit of universal Love lives in him, and he lives in Love, enjoying
the sweet Union and communion of Spirit, each with other.

When they enjoy the sweet delight of the Unity of one Spirit, and the free
content of the fruits and crops of this outward Earth, upon which their bodies
stand: this was called The man's innocence, or pleasure in the Garden before his
fall, or the day time of mankind; and day is more glorious then night; and
greater honor to be a child of the day, then of the night.

The fall of mankind, or his darkness is this, When that Son of universal Love,
which was the seed, out of which the creation sprung forth, did begin to go
behind the cloud of flesh, and to let self-seeking flesh which would needs be a
God, stand alone by his imaginary light, as we see, while the Sun is in the
skies, a man sees and knows his footsteps, but when the Sun is set under the
cloud of the dark night, then he imagins his way, and often times stumbles and
falls:

Even so, when universal Love shines in his glory in mankind, he stumbles not,
he walks in the light, because the light is in him; but when the light within
with draws and lets flesh stand alone, Flesh, that is, The selvish power will
not wait in peace, and acknowledge himself in a loss and in darkness, till the
Sun rise again:

But will fain be a God, and calls his weakness strength; and though there
appears nothing but deformity, yet he would have it called beauty; and because
his inward power is not suitable to his outward profession, he is tormented: he
is a Saint without, but a Devil within: but if thou would have peace, act as
thou art, show thy self abroad in action what thou art secretly; but when thou
beginst to imagine a content and happiness to thy self, by thy hypocritical
self invention, then thou art tormented, or shall be.

And by this imagination, mankind tears himself in pieces; as one of your
Colonels of the Army said to me, That the Diggers did work upon George Hill for
no other end but to draw acompany of People into Arms; and says our knavery is
found out, because it takes not that effect.

Truly thou Colonel, I tell thee, Thy knavish imagination is thereby
discovered, which hinders the effecting of that Freedom which by Oath and
Covenant thou have Engaged to maintain: for my part, and the rest, we had no
such thought; we abhor fighting for Freedom, it is acting of the Curse and
lifting him up higher; and do thou uphold it by the Sword, we will not; we will
conquer by Love and Patience, or else we count it no Freedom: Freedom gotten by
the Sword is an established Bondage to some part or other of the Creation; and
this we have Declared publicly enough; therefore thy imagination told thee a
lie, and will deceive thee in a greater matter, if Love does not kill him:
Victory that is gotten by the Sword, is a Victory that slaves gets one over
another; and hereby men of the basest Spirit (says Daniel) are set to Rule:
but Victory obtained by Love, is a Victory for a King.

But by this you may see what a liar imagination is, and how he makes bate, and
tears the Creation in pieces; for after that self Love has subdued others
under him, then imagination studies how to keep himself up and keep others down.

This is your very inward Principle, O ye present powers of England, you do not
study how to advance universal Love; if you did, it would appear in action: but
imagination and self-love mightily disquiets your mind, and makes you call up
all the powers of darkness to come forth and help to set the Crown upon the
head of Self, which is that Kingly power you have Oathed and Vowed against,
and yet uphold it in your hands.

Imagination begets Covetousness after pleasure, honor, and riches:
Covetousness begets Fear, least others should cross them in their Design; or
else begets a Fear of want, and this makes a man to draw the creatures to him
by hook or crook, and to please the strongest side, looking what others do, not
minding what himself does.

Like some of your great Officers, that told me, That we Diggers took away
other men's Propriety from them, by Digging upon the Common; yet they have taken
mine and other men's propriety of money (got by honest labor) in Taxes and
free quarter to advance themselves and not allow us that they promised us; for
it this beam in their own eyes they cannot see.

This Fear begets hypocrisy, subtlety, envy, and hardness of heart, which
makes a man to break all promises and engagements, and to seek to save himself
in others ruin, and to suppress and oppress every one that does not say as
he says, and do as he does.

And this hardness of heart begets pride and security, and this begets luxury
and lust of the flesh, and this runs into all excess with greedines, and being
in discontent against any that crosses his pleasure, till his heart become
fully like the heart of a Beast, as it is apparent in some at this day.

And thus by the power of self-love being advanced by the covetous sword
against universal love, that power of darkness rises up to perfection in
mankind, and so he makes one branch to tear and devour another by divisions,
evil surmisings, envious fightings, and killing, and by oppressing the meek in
Spirit, by unrighteous Laws, or by his self will managing good Laws
unrighteously, as corrupt Judges know how to do it, and think none sees them,
whereby part of mankind has freedom, and another part is cast out and thrown
under bondage.

And all this falling out or quarrelling among mankind, is about the earth who
shall, and who shall not enjoy it, when indeed it is the portion of every one,
and ought not to be striven for, nor bought, nor sold, whereby some are hedged
in, and others hedged out; for better not to have had a body, then to be
debarred the fruit of the Earth to feed and cloth it; and if every one did but
quietly enjoy the earth for food and raiment, there would be no wars, prisons,
nor gallows, and this action which man calls theft would be no sin, for
universal love never made it a sin, but the power of covetousness made that a
sin, and made Laws to punish it, though he himself live in that sin in a higher
manner, then he hangs or punishes. Those very men that punish others for theft
do theeve and rob, as Judges and Lawyers that take Bribes, or that takes their
Clients money, and through neglect lose their cause: Parliament and Army lives
in Theft, when as they take the Commoners money, and free quarter, and tell
them what they do is to make England a free Commonwealth, and yet all they do
is to make the Gentry free, and leaves the Commoners under bondage still; or
else why do you send your Soldiers to beat a few naked Spademen off from
digging the Commons for a livelihood, why do you not let the oppressed go free?
have they not bought it of you by their moneys and blood as well as the
Gentry, and will not you make good your Contract: Well, he that made the earth
for us as well as for you will set us free though you will not: when will the
Vail of darkness be drawn off your faces? will you not be wise O ye Rulers?

Well, this power of darkness is man's fall, or the right time of mankind.

But Universal love has declared that he will rise again, and he himself who
is the Seed, will bruise that Serpents head, and reconcile mankind to himself
again, and restore him to that Innocence and Peace which he is fallen from.
When this Son arises in more strength, and appears to be the Savior indeed, he
will then make mankind to be all of one heart and one mind, and make the Earth
to be a common treasury, though for the present in outward view there is
nothing but darkness and confusion upon the face of the earth, mankind.

When self love began to arise in the earth, then man began to fall, this is
Adam or the power of darkness that stops up the waters and well springs of life,
or the clouds that hide the Son of righteousness from man.

This Adam or dark power was small at the first, but he is risen to great
strength, and the whole Earth is now filled with him, as Isaiah says, Darkness
has covered the Earth, mankind. For let any that has eyes look either to them
above or them below, and they see darkness or the Devil rule, and this curse
destroys the Earth. The Creation sits like Rachel sighing, mourning, and
groaning under his oppressing power, and will not be comforted because they see
no savior to appear for their deliverance.

Indeed there are many saviors in word, but none in deed, and these great
false Christ's and false Prophets, does destroy the Creation under the color of
saving it, and the people sees them not, but looks upon them as saviors,
calling others false Christ's and false Prophets that speak against them.

The first false christ that promises to save the Creation, is covetous Kingly
power, resting in the hand of one man, or in the hand of many, but this power
saves but part, and holds another part of the creation in bondage, and any
government that rules by swordly power does so throughout all lands; therefore
he is a false Christ, and no true savior.

The Preaching Clergy or universative power, promises to save the Creation
declaratively, but he is a false Christ, he says and does not, Pharisee-like,
but will force people to maintain him from the Earth by their labors, for his
sayings, by the Laws of the Kingly power; he says, some are elected to
salvation, and others are reprobated; he puts some into heaven, thrusts others
into hell never to come out, and so he is not a universal Savior; that is no
salvation to the creation, mankind, while any part groans for the true Savior,
when he comes he will wipe away all tears, he comes not to destroy any but to
save all.

Then the power of the Lawyers, he says he will save the Creation, and this
false Christ proves the greatest devourer and tearer of the creation of any
other, for while he carries burdened men from one court to another promising
to save them, he at last saves himself and destroys others, and laughs at
others loss, and throws men further from peace then he found them before he
meddled with them: Well, From the Bailiffe to the Judge, these are the creations
of this Egyptian Taskmaster, and no burden of cheating like to it, for he
promises Justice, but behold nothing but oppression is in his hands.

Then next, The Art of buying and selling promises to save the Creation, and
bring it into peace, but this is a hypocritical false cheating christ too, for
hereby covetous self-love with his flattering tongue cheats honest hearted
ones, and casts them under tyranny, and gets the fullness of the Earth into his
hands, and lock it up in chests and barns from others, and says this is
righteous, and God gave it him, but thou cheater, thou lie; God the King of
righteousness gave it thee not, he bids thee sell all that thou have and give
to the poor, he does not bid thee lock it up from the poor, therefore thou
trading art, thou art no true savior neither, but a Devil, thou savest part,
and destroyest another part, yea and afterward destroyest that part which at
first thou seemedst to save.

Now all these saviors are linked together, if one truly fall all must fall,
they all promise to save the Creation, but destruction is in their hands and
actions, they all seek to set up self and particular power, and so to save but
part of the creation, for every one are destroyers of universal love: They
that sit in these seats would be called men of public Spirits, but truly you
are all selfish, you are afraid to own public spirited men, nay you are
ashamed some of you to be seen walking or talking with true public spirited
men, called Levellers.

But well, yet there is a promise of restoration and salvation to the whole
creation, and this must be wrought by a power contrary to darkness, for all
those former saviors lie under darkness, nay are branches of the power of
darkness it self, and darkness can never kill darkness; but now the true
Savior must be a power quite opposite to darkness: And this is,

The power of Universal Love, light and righteousness and if ever the creation
be wholly saved, this power must be the savior, for this is the blessing, and
he will declare himself the true Savior indeed, the other is but the curse,
this is the true restorer, the true seed with us, as he arises and spreads, he
will bruise the Serpents head in every one, and bring peace to all, and wipe
away all tears from the creation, and make a through salvation of it through
the whole earth, and leave none under bondage.

This is the Sun of righteousness when he arises, he disperseth darkness, and
will make all ashamed that had hands in promoting of the other false saviors
power; but I must leave this, and speak a little more of the present condition
mankind lies under, and this is darkness or the fall, and in this estate
ignorant inslaved slesh would ever run round in it, and never come out, but
counts it freedom, but they that know the burden of this estate hunger after
freedom.

This darkness is twofold, first inward, and that is the power of darkness in
his branchs, as covetousness, envy, pride, hypocrisy, self-love, this is the
curse in man, and this darkness has and yet does cover the earth; this power
would be as God, and makes one to rule over another, and he is so proud that he
will hasten to rule though he kill others for honor, and this is he that stirs
up wars and dissension, and thereby he destroys himself

Secondly this inward power sets one against another, and so fills the earth
with dark actions, and causes some part of mankind to tread others under foot
and puts them into bondage, and they that act this power calls it, The power
and Ordinance of God, which is true: It is God indeed, but it is the god of the
world, the prince of darkness, not the King of Righteousness; it is the power
of the Beast who is limited to rule for a time, times, and dividing of time,
and England is under that dividing of time, therefore I hope, England shall be
the tenth part of the City confusion that shall fall from the Beast first:

And this dark power or imaginary covetousness has raised a platform of
oppression in the creation, under which the creation groans, and waits to be
delivered; and it is raised thus,

First this dark power within makes every one to love himself with others loss,
just like Beasts of the Field; and this made mankind to begin to loath or envy
each others Freedom and peace, and hereby the Union and Communion of Love
within is broke and mankind is fallen from it: then this inward Covetousness
makes mankind to fight one against another for the Earth, and breaks Communion
in that, and falls from content therein likewise, and every one seeks to save
himself to take the Earth to himself, but none or few seeks the things of
Christ, or of universal Love.

Nay Covetousness is such a god, that where he Rules he would have all the
Earth to himself, and he would have all to be his servants, and his heart swells
most against Community; calling Community a thief, that takes other men's
Rights and Propriety from them, but community will force nothing from any
one, but take what is given in love, of that which others have wrought for; but
no man yet has bestowed any labor upon the Commons that lies waste; therefore
the Diggers does take no man's proper goods from them in so doing, but those
that by force spoils their labors, takes their proper goods from them, which
is the fruit of their own labors.

Well, you see how Covetousness would have all the Earth to himself, though he
let it lie waste: he stirs up Divisions among men, and makes parties fight
against parties; and all is but for this, Who shall enjoy the Earth, and live
in honor and case and rule over others: and the stronger party always rules
over the weaker party.

And hence came in Kingly power to rule outwardly, dividing between members of
that one body mankind, giving the Earth to that party called Gentry, who are
the Success^rs of some late Conquests, and denying the Earth to the poor
Commoners who are the Successors of some that were last Conquered.

So that by Kingly power the Earth is divided as it is now at this day: but as
the Scriptures say, Kings were given for a plague to the people, not a
blessing: And I believe the Nations have found this very true to their great
sorrow (...) and the way to cast out Kingly power again, is not to cast them
out by the Sword, for this does but set him in more power, and removes him from
a weaker to a stronger hand: but the only way to cast him out, is, For the
People to leave him to himself, to forsake fighting and all oppression, and to
live in love one toward another: This power of Love is, the true Savior.

The party that is called a King, was but the head of an Army, and he and his
Army having Conquered, shuts the conquered out of the Earth, and will not
suffer them to enjoy it, but as a servant and slave to him; and by this power
the creation is divided, and part are call into bondage; so that the best you
can say of Kingly power that Rules by the Sword is this, He is a murderer and a
theif.

And by this power the Earth is thus divided.

The several Nations of the Earth where Kings rule, are the several situation
of such grand Thieves and Murderers, that will rule over others by the Sword,
upholding a forced Propriety, which is the Curse; and persecuting the community
of Love, which is Christ the blessing.

And under them they have their chief Favorites or nearest Soldiers in Office
to himself, and to these he allows the greatest portion of the Earth, every one
his part, called a Lordship: and next to them the inferior Officers or
Soldiers, are appointed out lesser parcels of the Earth, called Freeholders,
paying no slavish Rent or Homage to any: but only acknowledgment, That the King
is their General or Head still.

And these Lords of Manors and Free holders having thus seated themselves in
the Earth, by taking other men's proper labors from them by the Sword, are
appointed by the Kiug as Watchmen* That if any of the conquered slaves seek to
Plant the Common waste Earth without their leave, they may be known and beaten
off: So that the god from whom they claim Title to the Land as proper to them,
shutting out others, was Covetousness the Murderer, the swordly power, that
great red Dragon, who is called, The god of the World.

But the King of Righteousness, who is universal Love, who is the Lord God
Almighty, bidding every one do as they would be done by; made the Earth for
All, without respect of person, and shuts out none from enjoying a peaceable
livelihood that has a body; therefore they that build upon the power of the
Sword, upholding covetous Propriety, are enemies to the law of Righteousness,
which is, Love your enemies, do as you would be done by.

But one of your Officers told me, What? ( says he) If we grant to every one
to have the Land of England in Common, we do not only destroy Propriety, but we
do that which is not practiced in any Nation in the world.

I Answered, It was true; Propriety came in you see by the Sword, therefore the
Curse; for the murderer brought it in, and upholds him by his power, and it
makes a division in the Creation, casting many under bondage; therefore it is
not the blessing, or the promised seed.

And what other Lands do, England is not to take pattern; for England (as well
as other Lands) has lain under the power of that Beast, Kingly propriety: But
now England is the first of Nations that is upon the point of Reforming: and if
England must be the tenth part of the City Babylon that falls off from the Beast
first, and would have that honor, he must cheerfully (and dally no longer)
cast out Kingly covetous Propriety, and set the Crown upon Christ's head, who is
the universal Love or Free community, and so be the leader of that happy
Restoration to all the Nations of the world: And if England refuse, some other
Nation may be chosen before him, and England then shall lose his Crown, for if
ever the Creation be Restored, this is the way which lies in this Two fold
power:

First Community of Mankind, which is comprised in the unity of spirit of Love,
which is called Christ in you, or the Law written in the heart, leading mankind
into all truth, and to be of one heart and one mind.

The Second is Community of the Earth, for the quiet livelihood in food and
raiment without using force, or restraining one another: These two Communities,
or rather one in two branches, is that true Levelling which Christ will work at
his more glorious appearance, for Jesus Christ the Savior of all men, is the
greatest, first, and truest Leveller that ever was spoke of in the world.

Therefore you Rulers of England, be not ashamed nor afraid of Levellers, hate
them not, Christ comes to you riding upon these clouds; look not upon other
Lands to be your pattern, all Lands in the world he under darkness, so does
England yet, though the nearest to Light and Freedom of any other; therefore
let no other Land take your Crown.

You have set Christ upon his throne in England by your Promises, Engagements,
Oaths, and Two Acts of Parliament, the One to cast out Kingly power; the Other
to make England a Free Commonwealth: Put all these into sincere Action, and
you shall see the work is done, and you with others shall sing Halelujah to him
that sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for evermore.

But if you do not, the Lamb shall show himself a Lion, and tear you in pieces
for your most abominable dissembling Hypocrisy, and give your Land to a People
who better deserves it: I have varied a little, therefore I will return to what
I was speaking.

I told you, That the Murdering and Theeving Sword has found out a Platform of
Tyrannical Government, called Kingly Power.

First here is the King, the Head of the murdering power, or great red Dragon.

Then there are Lords of Manors, who have the greatest circuit of Land,
because the next in Power to the Head.

Then there are Freeholders, that took the particular Enclosures which they
found in a Land when they Conquered it, and had turned out those that had
bestowed labor upon it, by force of the Sword, in the sield, or else by
sequestring afterward: These several parcels of Land are called
Free-hold-Land, because the Enjoyers or their Ancestors were Soldiers, and
helped the King to conquer; and if any of latter years came to buy these
Free-holds with Money got by Trading, it does not alter the Title of the
Conquest; for Evidences are made in the Kings Name, to remove the Free-holds so
bought from one man's hand to another.

But now Copyhold lands are parcels hedged in, and taken out of the common
waste land since the conquest, acknowledging Homage, Fines, and Heriots to the
Lord of that Manor or circuit in which that Enclosure by his leave is made:
this Homage still confirms the power of the conquests.

The Lords of Manors acknowledged Homage to the King in that Court of Wards,
which you have taken away to ease your selves.

But the Copyholders you will have to acknowledge Homage to Lords of Manors
still; and is not this partiality? O you Rulers, make the poor as free to the
Earth as your selves, and honor Righteousness.

Now for the drawing in of the People to yield Obedience to this Platform of
Kingly tyrannical power, to which People are made subject through fear,

The Kingly power sets up a Preaching Clergy to draw the People by insinuating
words to conform hereunto, and for their pains Kingly power gives them the
Tithes: And when the Kingly power has any Design to lift up himself higher,
then the Clergy is to Preach up that Design, as of late in our Wars the
Preachers most commonly in their Sermons meddled with little but State matters:
and then if People seem to deny Tithes, then the Kingly power by his Laws
does force the people to pay them: so that there is a confederacy between the
Clergy and the great red Dragon: the Sheep of Christ shall never fare well so
long as the wolf or red Dragon pays the Shepherd their wages.

Then next after this, the Kingly power sets up a Law and Rule of Government to
walk by: and here Justice is pretended, but the full strength of the Law is to
uphold the conquering Sword, and to preserve his son Propriety: therefore if
any one steal, this Law will hang them, and this they say is of God; and so
this Kingly power has power over the lives and labors of men at his pleasure;
for though they say the Law does punish, yet indeed, that Law is but the
strength, life and marrow of the Kingly power, upholding the conquest still,
hedging some into the Earth, hedging out others; giving the Earth to some, and
denying the Earth to others, which is contrary to the Law of Righteousness,
who made the Earth at first as free for one as for another.

Yea that Kingly power in the Laws appointed the conquered poor to work for
them that possess the Land, for three pence and four pence a day, and if any
refused, they were to be imprisoned; and if any walked a begging and had no
dwelling, he was to be whipped; and all was to force the slaves to work for them
that had taken their Propriety of their labors from them by the Sword, as the
Laws of England are yet extant, and truly most Laws are but to enslave the
Poor to the Rich, and so they uphold the conquest, and are Laws of the great
red Dragon.

And at this very day poor people are forced to work in some places for 4, 5,
and 6 pence a day; in other places for 8, 10, and 12 pence a day, for such
small prizes now Corn being deer, that their earnings cannot find them bread
for their Family; and yet if they steal for maintenance, the murdering Law will
hang them; when as Lawyers, Judges, and Court Officers can take Bribes by whole
sale to remove one man's Propriety by that Law into another man's hands: and is
not this worse the every then the poor man's that steals for want? Well, this
shows, that if this be Law, it is not the Law of Righteousness; it is a
Murderer, it is the Law of Covetousness and self-love; and this Law that
frights people and forces people to obey it by Prisons, Whips, and Gallows, is
the very kingdom of the Devil, and Darkness, which the Creation groans under
at this day.

And if any poor enslaved man that dares not steal, begins to mourn under that
bondage and says, We that work most have least comfort in the earth, and they
that work not at all, enjoy all; contrary to the Scripture which says, The
poor and the meek shall inherit the earth.

Presently the tithing Pri^st stop his mouth with a slam and tells him that is
meant of the inward satisfaction of mind which the poor shall have, though they
enjoy nothing at all, and so poor creatures, it is true, they have some ease
thereby, and made to wait with patience, while the Kingly power swims in
fullness, and laughs at the others misery; as a poor Cavalier Gentlewoman
presented a Paper to the General in my sight, who looked upon the woman with a
tender countenance; but a brisk little man and two or three more Colonels pulled
back the Paper not suffering the General to receive it, and laughed at the
woman who answered them again, I thought said she, you had not sat in the seat
of the scornful; this was done in Whitehall upon the 12. of December 1649.

Well, all that I shall say to these men that will enjoy the earth in realitie,
and tell others they must enjoy it in conceit, surely your judgment from the
most High sleeps not; the Law of Retaliation like for like, laughing for
laughing may be your portion, for my part I was always against the Cavaleers
cause; yet their persons are part of the Creation as well as you, and many of
them may enter into peace before some of you scoffing Ishmaelites; I am sure
you act contrary to the Scripture which bids you Love your enemies, and do as
you would be done by, and this Scripture you say you own; why then do you not
practice it, and do to the Cavaliers as the Prophet Eliah bid the King of
Israel do to his enemies whom he had taken prisoners, Set bread and water
(says he) before them, and send them to their master in peace.

Come, make peace with the Cavaliers your enemies, and let the oppressed go
free, and let them have a livelihood, and love your enemies, and do to them,
as you would have had them done to you if they had conquered you: Well, let
them go in peace, and let love wear the Crown.

For I tell you, and your Preachers, that Scripture whch says, The poor shall
inherit the earth, is really and materially to be fullfilled, for the Earth is
to be restored from the bondage of sword propriety, and it is to become a
common Treasury in reallitie to whole mankind, for this is the work of the
true Savior to do, who is the true and faithful Leveller even the Spirit and
power of universal love, that is now rising to spread himself in the whole
creating, who is the blessin, and will spread as far as the curse had spread to
take it of, and cast him out, and who will set the creation in peace.

This powerful Savior will not set up his Kingdom nor rule his Creation with
sword and fighting, as some think and fear, for he has declared to you long
since, that they that take the sword to save themselves shall perish with the
sword.

But this shall be the way of his conquest, even as in the days of the Beast,
the whole world wondered after him, set him up, and was subject to him, and did
persecute universal love, and made War against him and his Saints, and
overcame them for a time.

Even so the Spirit of love and blessing shall arise and spread in mankind like
the Sun from East to West, and by his inward power of love, light, and
righteousness, shall let mankind see the abomination of the swordly Kingly
power, and shall loath themselves in dust and ashes, in that they have owned
and upheld him so long, and shall fall off from him, loath him and leave him.

And this shall be your misery O you covetous oppressing Tyrants of the Earth,
not only you great self? seeking powers of England, but you powers of all the
World, The peo-shall all fall off from you, and you shall fall on a sudden like
a great tree that is undermined at the root. And you powers of England you
cannot say another day but you had warning, this falling of is begun already,
divisions shall tear and torter you, till you submit to Community; O come in,
come in to righteousness that you may find peace.

You or some of you hate the name Leveller, and the chiefest of you are afraid
and ashamed to own a Leveller, and you laugh and jeer at them; Well, laugh out
poor blind souls, the people and common Soldiers both lets you alone, but they
laugh in their hearts at you, and yet desire that you did know the things that
concern your peace.

The time is very near that the people generally shall loath and be ashamed of
your Kingly power, in your preaching, in your Laws, in your Councels, as now
you are ashamed of the Levellers; I tell you Jesus Christ who is that powerful
Spirit of Love is the head Leveller, and as he is lifted up, he will draw all
men after him, and leave you naked and bare, and make you ashamed in your
selves, his appearance will be with power; therefore Kiss the Son O ye Rulers
of the earth, least his anger fall upon you. The wounds of Conscience within
you from him shall be sharper then the wounds made by your sword, he shook
heaven and earth when Moses Law was cast out, but he will shake heaven and
earth now to purpose much more, and nothing shall stand but what is lovely; be
wise, scorn not the Council of the poor, least you be whipped with your own rod.

This great Leveller, Christ our King of righteousness in us, shall cause men
to beat their swords into plowshares, and spears into pruning hooks, and
nations shall learn war no more, and every one shall delight to let each other
enjoy the pleasures of the earth, and shall hold each other no more in bondage;
then what will become of your power? truly he must be cast out for a murthe^er;
and I pity you for the torment your spirit must go through, if you be not
fore-armed, as you are abundantly forewarned from all places; but I look upon
you as part of the creation who must be restored, and the Spirit may give you
wisdom to foresee a danger, as he has admonished diverse of your rank already
to leave those high places, and to lie quiet and wait for the breakings forth
of the powerful day of the Lord. Farewell, once more. Let Israel go free.

A Bill of Account of the most Remarkable Sufferings that the Diggers have met
with from the great red Dragons power since April 1. 1649. which was the first
day that they began to Dig, and to take Possession of the Commons for the
Poor on George-Hill in Surrey.
1. THe first time, diverse of the Diggers were carried Prisoners into Walton
Church, where some of them were struck in the Church by the bitter Professors
and rude Multitude; but after some time freed by a Justice.

2. They were fetched by above a hundred rude people, whereof John Tailor was
the Leader, who took away their Spades, and some of them they never had again:
and carried them first to Prison at Walton, and then to a Justice at Kingstone,
who presently dismissed them.

3 The Dragonly enemy pulled down a House which the Diggers had built upon
George-Hill, and cut their Spades and Howes to pieces.

4 Two Troops of Horse were sent from the General to fetch us before the
Council of War, to give Account of our Digging.

5 We had another House pulled down, and our Spades cut to pieces.

6 One of the Diggers had his head sore wounded, and a Boy beaten, and his
Clothes taken from him: diverse being by.

7 We had a Cart and Wheels cut in pieces, and a Mare cut over the back with a
Bill when we went to fetch a Load of Wood from Stoak-Common, to build a House
upon George-Hill.

8 Diverse of the Diggers were beaten upon the Hill, by William Star and John
Tailor, and by men in women's apparel, and so sore wounded, that some of them
were fetched home in a Cart.

9 We had another House pulled down, and the Wood they carried to Walton in a
Cart.

10 They Arrested some of us, and some they cast into Prison; and from others
they went about to take away their Goods, but that the Goods proved another
man's, which one of the Diggers was Servant to.

11 And indeed at diverse times besides we had all our Corn spoiled; for the
Enemy was so mad, that they tumbled the Earth up and down, and would suffer no
Corn to grow.

12 Another Cart and Wheels was cut to pieces, and some of our Tools taken by
force from us, which we never had again.

13 Some of the Diggers were beaten by the Gentlemen, the Sheriff looking on,
and afterward Five of them were carried to White-Lion Prison, and kept there
about 5 meeks, and then let out.

14 The Sheriff with the Lords of Manors and Soldiers standing by, caused two
or three poor men to pull down another House: and diverse things were stolen from
them.

15 The next day two Soldiers and two or three Countrymen sent by Parson
Platt, pulled down another House, and turned a poor old man and his wife out of
doors to lie in the field in a cold night.

And this is the last hitherto; and so you Priests as you were the last that
had a hand in our persecution, so it may be that Misery may rest in your hand;
for assure your selves, God in Christ will not be mocked by such Hypocrites
that pretend to be his nearest and dearest Servants as you do, and yet will not
suffer his hungry, naked, and house-less members to live quiet by you in the
Earth, by whose Blood and Moneys in these Wars, you are in peace.

And now those Diggers that remain, have made little Hutches to lie in like
Calf-cribs, and are cheerful; taking the spoiling of their Goods patiently, and
rejoicing that they are counted worthy to suffer persecution for Righteousness
sake: and they follow their work close, and have Planted diverse Acres of Wheat
and Rye, which is come up and promises a very fruitful crop, and Resolves to
preserve it by all the diligence they can, and nothing shall make them slack
but want of Food, which is not much now, they being all poor People, and having
suffered so much in one expense or other since they began; for Poverty is their
greatest burden; and if any thing do break them from the Work, it will be that.

You Lordly Foes, you will rejoice
this news to hear and see;
Do so, go on; but we will rejoice
much more the Truth to see*
For by our hands truth is declared,
and nothing is kept back;
Our faithfulness much joy does bring,
though victuals we may lack.
This trial may our God see good,
to try, not us, but you;
That your profession of the Truth,
may prove either false or true.
And these are the Troubles and Persecutions that the Diggers have gone through
since they began, besides many particular abuses from rude Spirits, and
multitudes of slanders, lies, and bad names, that the mouths of the scoffing
Ishmaelites are filled with, and the secret enmity that has come from close
Hypocrites, that go for great Professors.

But now Profession, thou art tried
to purpose, all shall see,
And verbal talk it will appear
a Devil for to be:
For actions pure, holds forth the life
of God and Christ most dear:
And false Dissembling now must die,
if Scriptures you will hear;
You preaching men if Truth you will own,
see Truth be acted to,
Or else to Christ you will appear
to be his mortal foe.
Scribes, Pharisees, and the Theif,
that Judas was by name,
Great preachers were, but for no deeds,
the Truth they much did stain:
No deeds you will say! Yes, that they had:
its true they had indeed;
But what deeds were they you can see?
no herb, but stinking weed:
For Persecuion ever was
the Work that came from them,
And deadly foes they ever were,
to Christ, and righteous men.
And here I end, having put my Arm as far as my strength will go to advance
Righteousness: I have Writ, I have Acted, I have Peace: and now I must wait to
see the Spirit do his own work in the hearts of others, and whether England
shall be the first Land, or some other, wherein Truth shall sit down in triumph.

But O England, England, would God thou did know the things that belong to
thy peace before they be hid from thine eyes: The Spirit of Righteousness has
striven with thee, and does yet strive with thee, and yet there is hope. Come
in thou England, submit to Righteousness before the voice go out, my Spirit
shall strive no longer with Flesh; and let not Coveteousnesse make thee
oppress the poor.

We have Declared our Reasons for our Digging plentifully enough; and you
Rulers of England, will you always be like deaf Adders, etc? We have received
many affronts from Lords of Manors and their Servants diverse times; yet
nothing makes us be at a stand, Whether England shall be the first Land that
shall fall off from the Beast, and set Righteousness upon the Throne, or no,
but the late Action of the head of the Soldiery, in granting a party of Horse
to come and weaken us.

Gentlemen of the Soldiery, be not offended, for you promised me in Whitehal
Gallerie, that you would not meddle with us, but leave us to the Law of the
Land, and the Country Gentlemen to deal with us, and so you did a long time,
and we hope in time that love and patience will conquer our furious enemies.

Yet we understand which a little troubles us, yet content That the General
gave his consent that the Soldiers should come to help to beat of the Diggers,
and to pull down their Houses; it is true, the Soldiers with the Gentlemen our
enemies came, and caused others to pull down our houses, but the Soldiers did
not meddle, none but one, but expressed sorrow to see the Passages.

But though they were modest, and expressed tenderness, ^et the Generals grant
and the Soulders presence was a great crush to our business; Gentlemen of the
Army, we have spoke to you, we have appealed to the Parliament, we have
declared our cause with all humility to you all, and we are Englishmen, and
your friends that stuck to you in your miseries, and these Lords of Manors
that oppose us were wavering on both sides, yet you have heard them, and
answered their request to beat us off, and yet you would not afford us an
Answer.

Yet love and patience shall lie down and suffer; Let pride and covetousness
stretch themselves upon their beds of ease, and forget the afflictions of
Joseph, and persecute us for righteousness sake, yet we will wait to see the
issue, the power of righteousness is our God; the globe runs round, the longest
Sunshine day ends in a dark night; and therefore to thee O thou King of
righteousness we do commit our cause; Judge thou between us and them that
strive against us, and those that deal treacherously with thee and us, and do
thine own work, and help weak flesh in whom the Spirit is willing.

FINIS.
