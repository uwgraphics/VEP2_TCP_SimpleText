See Reader by this figure what thou art,
And let thy inward thoughts dictate to thee,
Whether this hellish Chair be not thy heart,
Where Pluto sits (and rules) if so it be,
(For Heavens love) take this advice of me,
Arm thee with grace; throw Satan out o'th Chair,
Put Christ in's place, who quells the Prince o'th Air.

An Exordium (or premonitory) Epistle to the Prudent Christian.
READER,
I Confess thou may wonder at my formidable Frontespeece, or terrible title,
which may (perhaps) squeese from thee some conjecture contrary to verity, or my
expectation, as that the work contains more spite or vanity, then wit or
Christianity, but take this for thy learning (beforehand) that if thy judgment
wrest from thee such an uncharitable Censure, thou thy self art guilty of
(...) judge, for by this Diabolical doalest, I endeavor to reach thee
(according to my ability) thy christian duty to God and thy Neighbor, vices
being exposed, make the vicious actors of them ashamed (if they be not past
stame) and the honest and virtuous livers more confidently annimated to
prosecute their pious (...): the anticut enenmie of mankind (by (...)
appellation) is said (sometimes) to assume the place of an Angel of light,
thereby (with counterfeit Coin) to deceive the minds of selfe-will'd
Christians (in name) that with the more fallity he may enter into the hearts
of them whose consoperated opinions renders him their greatest Antagonist (I
mean in their own conceptions) Though they be inwardly his most endeared
friends and whom he may most easily possess with a vain shadow of justice, as
by imagining themselves to be the servants of the God of heaven, when (indeed
the more is the pity) they are (by suuh sinister practices, which they
follow) even slaves to (him) the 'Devill of hell: whose subtle stratagems, and
damnable devices (to game the souls of self-conceited, and presumptious
worldlings) thou art, good Prudent, and Christian READER, preadmonished by thy
souls health wishing friend,

COme hither all you my beloved, Black, Blew, Red, Green, Gray, Russet, and
Orange-tawny Boys, Fernds of all sorts, sizes, and ages, from 1635 years
standing, to little two-yeere-old Devils, you my constant Colleg^ars of this
Infernal University, you my trusty Agents, who negotiate for me in the
Terrestreall Globe, to the enriching of my Kingdom, the increasing of my
subjects, and the augmentation of my glory (briefly) you, I say, who as my
nimble servants sometimes by visible, but most commonly by invisible means, do
attend those who are appointed for a portion of my inheritance in the world,
least at any time (through want of quotidiall (nay rather moral solicitations
and attendance) they should be snatched out of my potent paws: It Is true (my
trusty Rogers) I have no great cause (I confess) to question your sedulity nor
vigilancie (I mean in general) yet let me tell you (my good friends) there
are some of you in particular, whose sloth is now of late days highly
reprehensible, how else has it come to pass, that the Sun-day is so devoutly
observed, drunkenness in the time of Divine Service so Circumspectly avoided;
how comes so much fasting and praying, suppression of Monopolists and
Pattentees; and diverse other abuses reformed (especially in the Kingdom of
England, whence (I say) proceeds all this, but through your tardinesse and
negligence: but let that pass, I will not exasperate my patience overmuch,
nor extenuate your diligence beyond desert, but having a little reprehended
what is amiss in you, I now purpose to render (to your worthy praise and my
great glory and comfort) an account of (and thanks for) the good services that
of late years you have done to the propagation and elevation of vice the
extenuation and (almost) extirpation of virtue in the Kingdom of England
(aforesaid) wishing, exhorting, charging, and commanding you and every one of
you (as you tender my love) or fear my displeasure, or wish the enlargement
and expansion of this my didiabollicall Monarchy) to prosecute (to your utmost
endeavors, and with the most exact care and diligence that you possibly may)
the courses that you have so auspitiously begun: for the furtherance whereof
(and that you may with more alacrity and facility execute my designs) I will
demonstrate unto you in what professions I am most effectually and punctually
pleased, and by what men and means my Empire is expanded; Then prick up your
ears, and listen (with attention) to the works of the Devil: for you must
take especial care in a matter of such high consequence, that all things
conduceable to this designed work, be done with a plausible deportment, that
as poison may (and is oftentimes) sweetened with honey (or sugar) to make it be
diliciously swallowed, so temtations of this nature (which fills this vast
Infernal Kingdom) must be sweetened with promises (nay commonly with
performances) of worldly wealth, honor, fame, dignity, and reputation, as for
example, the drunkard must be styled a Good fellow, a Boon companion, a sound
Trout, a notable blade, nay, as honest a man as ever pist with, etc. or as
trod upon a shoe of leather (a large Encomium) for it seems the Saints never
troad upon any. The libidenous Letcher must not want his titles, for he,
though he have no Gentry hereditary, nor dares adventure to get any in the
field of Mars, yet (with a pox to him) betwixt Venus and Cornelius (not
Cornelius Agrippa) he shall get enough to make him a Gentleman at three
skirmishes, and Mr. Present-time (the Herald) shall justify it. The covetous
catiffe that most damnable Idolater, who adores Crosses and Images) must be
counted a very good Husband (though his wife say noe such matter) a thriving
man that by his pinching parsimony, and trucelent oppression of the poor, he
shall get (besides the little of a rich man) the Devil and all. But it were a
Labor endless to tell you in particular what your selves know (so well as I) in
general there be damnable sinners of all professions sort, sizes, sects and
ages, unless it be little children, whereof (to my great grief) too many dye,
before they be capable of deadly sines so yet I am deprive'd of millions that
way. Therefore it behooves you my boon associats my Impassible postillians, my
Machevilian messengers, and Avernian Ambassadors, to be the more sedulous and
diligent among those of ripe age, let them not pass (at the most) eight years
of age before they being instructed to swear, curse, lie, (...) the name of
God, sing baudy songs pilpher small triffels as farthings or pence, from there
parents, to buy pares; aples, or plumbs, these are good beginnings (my lads)
and being ends according to my own desire; when they come to exceed twelve,
thentis high time to teach them to frequent Play Houses, Taverns, Alehouses,
and (though their abilities yet pemit them not) let them for the more speedy
enableing themselves, frequent baudy-houses, and be sure do not forget to
teach them (in their childhood) to play at dice and cards, though at first but
for fardings, yet from this small beginning when they come to maturity of age,
they will exceed from fatthings to penc, from penc, to shillings; from
shillings, to Crowns, from crowns to pounds, and so upwards according to our
Diobollicall arithmeticke, until they come to poverty, from thence, to robbing
(or stealing) and consequently, etc. For the Female fex, lot them not arive to
15. at the most, before they be endoctrinated in all the postures of pride and
noveltie in fashion, teach them to curle (and lay out) their hair, expose
their naked breasts, etc. that by these external deportments, their internal
intentions may be known; but above all things be not negligent in following
your buusinesse close in every season, until the harvest (of reward) be come,
you have sown seeds of dissension, sects and schisms are plentifully spread,
and will, undoubtedly) yield an infinite crop; O how happy has it been for my
traffic, since the first Authors of these damnable Heresies were, severally,
suggested by me and you; every one of them to invent, and teach, an opinion
according his, nay to her, (...) well shuffel'd, my boys, play on boldly, in
the Devils name, if we win not Millions of souls at this game, let us burn
the cards, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, I shall take up an unlimmitted laughter, if I
don't recall my self in time; For indeed, how can I otherwise choose; alas you
know, my dearest, that heretofore we have laid many years to one soul, and
yet at the last have lost both it, our time and labor, and come home quite
vanquished without it, but, now, ha, ha, ha, they come in tumbling, and
crowding, without any pains taking ha, ha, ha, I can now sit snorting in my
Chair, and have my work done ready to my hand, according to my own desire, or
heart could wish; the twiggs being well limed at the first, has saved labor
ever since, for they poor souls are so blinded and lulled asleep with that
somniferous potion of selfe-conceited sanctity, and purity, that they think
themselves true to my enemy, and enemy to me; but in this they please me
exceedingly, let them run on in their erroneous conceits, and think so still,
they shall never be hindered, but rather furthered, by me, but my fear is, if
your care be not used to the extremity of diligence, that they will smell it
out of themselves; look to it, I charge you, for they know that a Kingdom
divided within it self, cannot stand, nor a house divided escape inevitable
ruin; therefore to prevent this (...), for they have commonly good (...),
propose unto them hot Capons, Shoulders of Mutton, Pullers in white bloath,
collops and eggs, eat even (and most especially on that day which most (...)
me) Godd-friday, possess them severally with strong delusions of
self-conceited sanctity, that every man may say (or at the least think so) to
his Neighbor, Stand further off, come not near me, for I am holyer then thou,
noli me tangere, thou profane and wicked man, let them be perseverent in this,
and then sleeping and waking, all is mine, quoth the Devil, so sure as God's in
heaven, their pride (as mine did at first) will cast them headlong into hell,
and now it comes into my mind) I conjure you all to be mindful of my very good
friends, and servants, composers and publishers of these lying and scandalous
Pamphlets, which daily are carried and spread about, sometimes to the disgrace
of them that hate me to the death; and tell those my trusty factors, that I
will at no time be forgetful of their care and diligence to the increase of so
many notable vice, which advance my state, as lying, standering, envy,
detraction and blasphemy, all damnable fins, and seriously prohibited by
Almighty God, my immortal enemy, I know, and you know, that by these only
means, many Millions of souls come daily to my kingdom; therefore it behooves
you to be exceeding forward in a matter of such deep importance, and to be
extreme solicitous to preoccupate (so far as possibly you may) the suppression
and prohibition of this numerous rabble of (...), and Pamphliters, by the
sublime (...) it of the Parliament, for if that should come to pass, through
want of vigilaney, my Empire would loose a great part of it is propagation, and
I of any glory. But I hope you will at no time be taken tardy in these
affairs, which is no hard task to effect, seeing that the prosession, though
base, propounds into them both profit and pleasure, without much pain taking,
enough said of that, now we proceed to other particulars, which may fortify
your memories, when you have occasion to use them in the world in several
ways, as I shall endoctrinate you, first I tell you, my subtle substitute,
that I find great utility and comfort by the quotidian resort of Whores,
Baudes, pickpockets, Cheaters, etc. to stage plays, seek to set that forward:
secondly I have great gain from these place, called Bawdy-houses, therefore be
serious and urgent in your promising ample rewards to the dooers and sufferers
of the premise, let the panders be petulent, the Baudes impudent, the whores
arrogart, and the Officers superindulgent, etc. Thirdly be pressive to further
(through hope of gain) that hipocriticall secret fraud in shopkeepers, hidden
under Yea, and Nay, verily, and truly, etc. with their dark shops, false
weights, measures and Wares, to the inritching of themselves for a time, and me
to eternity: and fourthly, do not forget to encourage those damnable
Dammablades in the damming, sincking, perishing, and renouncing, tell them that
all shall be punctually performed on Gods part and mine: for he will certainly
by these provocations, and invitations, damn, sinck, perish, and renounce
their souls, then what follows, but that it is my part to take them (according
to their customary wish, The Devil take me) and so nodoubtedly, I will. For
while they seek to dissect (or annatomize) God with their imprecations and
oaths; as heart, wound and blood, be you ready, and diligent, upon his (...)
of them, as justly, to seal them for me. And, now I call it to mind, let
(...) remember you of one especial innovation in trading, introduced through
the gradation of time, in England, chiefly in, and adjacent to, the Cities of
(...) and (...), to the ample increase of bestial ebriety, which is the(...),
or wellspring of almost all other most damnable sins and impieties, therefore
be sure to assist with your especial care, and diligence, the proadintors, or
primo parens of this horrible sin of drunkenness; and those be the Brewers
of this exorbitant and Circean liquor called 14. Shillings Ale: these are the
true foster-fathers of this execrable vice, and deserve especial notise,
praise, thanks (and reward) for their service, most of them profess themselves
very precise, I profess, indeed, and in truth, and unless it be in private
among the brethren or sisters, those that abhor the most abominable sin of
drunkenness, but as the proverb says, If there were no receivers there would
be no thieves; and consequently, if no thieves no receivers; so that these
b^nding Ale-brewers are the principal (and original) cause of so many law
less blind Alehouses (as we call them) that under the pretense of keeping
Tobacco-shops (whom I can never praise enough) presume (and that without any
just license from the Justice) to dra^ and fell with (be^lish) black pots, this
diabolical drink after the rate of 2 d. 2 pint, neither must I forget to extol
the service of those (wilfully) blind Beadles, whose eyes being shadowed with
two Sillings by the quarter, will wink at at (these great, under the name of)
small faults; so let them do still, and want no annimition thereunto, for by
this means they do in an open rebellious way, against the laws of God and
King, in stead of fasting and praying (which pleases God too much for my
profit) use all possible ways and means for the (...) Drunkenesse and many
other most abominable vices which bring some to beggory, others to stealing,
and so make work for the Beadle, and the Hangman, Gramercy fourteen ^^^ling
Ale-brewer for (the most part of all) this; besides their (...) day (I (...)
their servants) about this unnecessary (and unconscionable) and to augment
their gains (and their sins) it is so Bumbasted ^est in the tunning, that
being settled, and fit to drink (which to say truth, it never is) the Victulers
have (oftentimes) but 27. Gallons for a barrel, it is so iumbled and
sophisticated, that beyond the height of wholesome nourishment, inflaming and
intoxicating the brains of poor laboring people, spending their time and
means, at this Acherontick Ale, while their wives, children and families want
bread at home, whereby the number of poor does increase, which is, both to
them, and to me, advantageous, for the poorer sort are their chief and most
constant customers in this damnable course of trading, for the drinking of
their fulsome and spungious Ale; and thus having full proof of their trusty
service to me, and the amplitude and increase of so many other (by their means)
I would have you to promise them (and I will perform it) some especial place
in Hell (a great preferrment) above other petty offenders; encourage them
closely to Bu^^^ie to their business, so as the Center of the work may yield
forth Share of their damnable endeavors: and exhort them to be confident,
that with a Dash to be are the Bell (over) the way it may pass for Fourteen
shillings the Barrel, at Chequer pay; but I know no reason why there should
not be Crown Ale, as well as Crown soap: no, no, I am mistaken, let them
still continue their brewing Strong, High and mighty Ale, that may sparkle so
proudiy, as G^^ of Warwick; nay, let it be so strong and heady, that
sakef-Farmers, Fish wives Cobblers, Chimney-sweepers, Rag-gatherers and T^^^ers;
may be merry, and sing bawdy and drunken catcher and especially, forget not
lying Tales, and the continual (...) of this tatterd regiments let the buy
then of all their Songs be sung to this Tune (by all these Ale-bibbers) Strong
Ale is meat drink and cloth, so likewise let them stand to it, that to hold
such Pot-companions in union, it may be compard to Buckle and thong; even in
despite of our potent adversary, who commends, and only brewes Ten shillings
Ale, and will Bide by it and be sure to take these instructions along with you,
for the encouraging all those my constant servants, that for the better, and
more credible prosecution of their most damnable courses, let them practice by
means so to insinuate with men in place of Authority, that both of them (the
Brewer and the victuler) may bear some Office for maintenance of civil
government in the Parish (where the dwell) that so they may be the better
enabled, for their own private gains, to connive at sin and wickedness;
and so anticipate the legal proceedings against their hellish conversations
herein: and not to doubt, but that though their educations afford them neither
writing nor reading, yet, if they can do by my instructions aforesaid, they
may be called to be under (if not capital) Constables to execute the Offices of
religious honestmen, that so by their Authority in those places, they may
mightily increase my Empire; I could dictate many other advices: but I know
that few words may suffice to instruct the wise, therefore I Will say no more to
you at this time, least I should be tedious; But go on in the Devils name,
and bid them (as the Familist says) Increase and multiply, Vale.

The Proscript.
COurteous Reader, Having shown by this figure the Diabolical intentions, and
invaterate malice of the Common Enemy to Mankind, (the Devil) Let us (...)
aid of Almighty God, that by the (...) of his grace, me may escape all his
