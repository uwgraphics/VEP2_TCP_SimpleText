Precepts for Christian practice, or the Rule of the new CREATVRE.
Duty 1.
1. BE always sensible of thy original corruption, and consider how it
inclines thee continually to all evil, and indisposeth thee to any good;
groan under it, and bewail it, as Paul did, Romans 7.24.

Also take special notice of your actual sins, or daily infirmities, in
thought, word, deed. Endeavor to make your peace with God for them before you
go to bed: which must be done these four ways.

1. By repenting and confessing your sins to God, working your heart to
grief and sorrow for them, by some such melting considerations as these.
First, of Gods goodness to you. 2. Of the unreasonablenesse and every way
unprofitablenesse of sin. 3. Of the great prejudice and damage that comes to
the soul by sin. John, 1.1, 9.
2. By believing, and casting your self wholly on Christ's righteousness for
remission of sin, and for reconciliation with God, Romans 3.22, 24, 25. 3. By
cleaving to Gods promises of pardon, and peace, Isaiah, 43.25. Romans 5.1. 4. By
waiting till the Lord shall speak to you, Psalm. 85.8.
Duty 2.
Get your union with Christ, and interest in Christ cleared and confirmed to
you daily more and more, that you are a branch in his vine, and a member in his
body, 2 Cor. 13.5. This may be done three ways.

1. By daily renewall of your faith in Christ, especially of that act of faith,
whereby the soul knits, or ties it self unto Christ, casts, or roules it
self on Christ for salvation. Cause your heart in a solemn manner every day
to act this part, or to put forth this primitive act of faith in the view of
the whole soul. The daily exercise hereof will increase, and strengthen the
divine habit of faith in the soul, and make the soul sensible of the very act
of it. By frequent believing you shall feel at your very heart, that you do
believe; so shall you have a witness in your self, that you are in Christ, 1 John 5.10. 2. By examining your heart upon what grounds you take Christ to be
yours. The grounds are these five; 1. A sight and sense of of your sins, as of
the guilt, power, and punishment of them, and of your misery by them, Mat.
9.13. 2. Your want of Christ seen, and felt at your very heart, to justify,
sanctify, redeem, and save you, else you are utterly lost, and undone
everlastingly, Luke 19.10. 3. Gods free and general offer of Christ to any
that will take him by faith, John 3.16. there are manifold promises to this
purpose: And the grounds of all Gods offers and donations of Christ to the
poor soul are free grace, rich mercy, undeserved love, Ephesians. 2.4, 5, 7. Tit.
3.4, 5, 6. 4 Christ's sweet and gracious invitation of such to come to him as
are weary of sin, Matthew. 11.28. to buy, as have no money, Isaiah 55.1. no
worth, or desert in themselves. 5. As sinful vile wretches as you are, have
been sought of Christ, and found in Christ, as 1 Cor. 6.9, 10, 11. 1 Timothy 1.13.
Paul was a blasphemer, persecuter, and yet obtained mercy, and therefore why may
not you? Thus the more clearly you discern upon what grounds you take Christ,
the more clear is your title to Christ, evinced to your own soul.
3. By surveying and observing in what manner you take Christ daily. Which is,
whether, First, you do wholly renounce all opinion and conceit of your own
righteousness and desert, Mark 8.34. Phil. 3.7, 8, 9. so that you come to
Christ empty of your self, very vile, yea, nothing in your own eyes, unworthy
to receive him. 2. Whether you lay hold on Christ alone with an empty hand of
faith, joining nothing at all with Christ in the matter of salvation; as the
holy Martyr at the stake cried out, None but Christ, None but Christ. 3.
Whether you find the Father drawing your heart after Christ, Joh. 6.44. which
is in hungring and panting desires, that will never be satisfied without him;
so that the stream, both of your Judgment, Phil. 3.7, 8. and affections run
toward him, 1 Cor. 2.2. Gal. 6.14. 4. Whether you take Christ as a Lord to
rule you, as well as a Jesus to save you, Col. 2.6. As one that is all in all
to you, your wisdom, your righteousness, your sanctification and redemption,
1 Cor. 1.30. your spiritual food, John 6.48. your Raiment, Romans 13.14. your
Strength, Phil. 4.13. your life, Gal. 2.20. Col. 3.3. 5. Whether you seek and
wait for Christ, (out of the sense of your spiritual want and penury) in
every ordinance public and private, Word, Sacraments, Prayer, Meditation,
Conference; not as they are your own works of sanctification, but as they are
Gods Ordinances appointed of purpose for the manifestation and communication of
Christ to the soul.

Frequent perusal hereof will clear to you your manner of taking Christ, and
that will evidence to you your right and title which you have in Christ Jesus.

Duty 3.
Labor to draw and derive from Christ (by the powerful attractive force of
faith) spiritual ability sufficient for the day. 1. To perform all your
duties, Phil. 4.13. 2. To exercise all your graces, 2 Cor. 3.5. 3. To resist
and overcome all your tentations and corruptions, Romans 8.37. 4. To undergo all
your trials, and afflictions thereof, John 1.16.


Make your provision of grace and strength from Christ every morning, fetch
from him so much as you shall have occasion to use all day long; yea, and upon
all occasions that fall out in the day, go to Christ still for the wisdom
that must direct you, for the holiness that must character you, for the
shoulder which must bear your crosses, for that strength that must resist your
tentations, and for ability to perform all duties as duties.

To this end act your faith daily in the promises of grace, and strength, as
John 1.16. Ezekiel. 36.26, 27. Isaiah 44.3. Zech. 10.12. these and the like
promises are security given you by God, that you shall receive grace in the use
of the ordinances, which are as the conduit-pipes or instruments of conveying
the same from Christ unto you.

This is the way and means to do all in the strength of Christ, and to take
forth a great deal of Christ into your soul, that not you, but Christ may
live in you, Gal. 2.20.

Duty 4.
Perform daily duties both in family, and closet (especially these three, of
Prayer, Meditation, Reading) and do them with serious intention, heat of
affection, diligence and delight, Jerem. 48.10. Mal. 1.14. 1 Chronicles. 21.24. To
this end, 1. Watch to these duties, keep the heart in a good frame for them,
undefiled with sin, untainted by the world, Ephesians. 6.18. 2. Take the fittest
time for the performance of them all; when you are least dull and sluggish.
Begin the day constantly with thoughts of God, Psalm. 57.7, 8, 9. 3. Be very
real, serious, and substantial with God in them, endeavor to feel all
duties at your heart, inliving, enlarging, inflaming your affections.


These be the duties of most importance and consequent, commodity and comfort
to the soul, because they properly aim at, and reach to souls good, and
celestial happiness, to train up a soul for heaven, Deuteronomy. 4.29.

Duty 5.
Fortify your selves every morning against your special lusts to which you
are by nature most prone, or shall be most tempted, be it pride, passion,
convetousnesse, etc.

This is done, 1. by Arguments and holy reasonings within your selves, drawn
from the sad effects thereof, as disprofit, discomfort, disgrace, or the like,
to discover the unreasonablenesse of your sins, and make your soul ashamed of
them. For example, shall I be proud? then I am sure to fall, for pride goes
before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall, Prove. 16.18. and God
will count me for his enemy, for God resists the proud, Jam. 4.6. Shall I be
angry? if I let passion in, I cannot keep Satan out, Ephesians. 4, 26, 27. Again,
I shall grieve the holy Spirit of God, Ephesians. 4.30, 31. Shall I be covetous? I
cannot but be very sinful, since the love of money is the root of all evil, 1 Timothy 6.10. 2. By pondering in your mind upon the precepts in Gods book against
your sins, Prove. 6.23, 24. And on the judgments threatened or inflicted for
them; as on proud Herod, Acts 12.23. voluptuous Dives, Luke 16.23. churlish
Nabal, 1 Samuel 25.38. 3. By applying promises of mortification close to your
hearts, as a plaster to the sore, for subduing your iniquities, Mic. 7.19.
Romans 6.14. 4. By drawing virtue from Christ's death into the soul, which has
in it a killing force of sin, Romans 6.4.5.6. Phil. 3.10.


Duty 6.
Get your hearts strongly fixed on God, by trusting on him, Psalm. 112.7. and
submitting to him, 2. Sam. 15.26. 1. Sam. 3.18. against all the fears, cares,
doubts, trialls, afflictions of every day, for sufficient to the day is the
evil thereof, Mat. 6.34. To this end, 1. Be prudent to foresee your personal
trialls, and troubles, whatsoever they are like to be, Pro. 22.3. 2. Go hide,
and lay up your self in God, run unto his name, for God is a rock of
habitation to which a poor soul may continually resort, God will give
commandment to save him, Psalm. 71.3. 1 Peter. 4.19. 3. Especially commit that
very thing to God, put into his hands, whatsoever you desire to keep, or fear
to lose, 2. Tim. 1.12. be it life, liberty, name, friends, maintenance, etc.
What you would have resolved, if it be a doubt, Psalm. 37.5. Or supplied, if it
be a want, Prove. 16.7. Or removed, if it be a cross, Psalm. 50.5 And together
with the thing, cast all your care, fear, sorrow, and trouble of mind about
it wholly on the Lord, Mat. 6.31. 1 Pet. 5.7. Psalm. 55.22. 4. Renew your faith
in those promises every day which most concern your present estate; as in
promises, 1 Of supplies, if you be in want, Psalm. 34.8. and 37.3. and 84.11.
Mat. 6.30. 2 Of protection, if you be in danger, Psalm. 34.7. 3 Of direction, if
in doubt, Jam. 1.5. 4 Of deliverance, if in trouble, Job. 5.19. 5 Of a good
end, and sanctified use of all. Deuteronomy. 8.1. Jam. 5.11. Romans 8.28. Heb. 12.10. 5.
Labor to see Gods hand, Psalm. 39.9. believe his love, Heb. 12.6. Rev. 3.19.
and with all meekness, and patience to resign up your self wholly to his
will in every affliction, Mat. 26.39.


Duty 7.
Get, and keep a savory relish continually of your christian privileges,
wherewith you are invested as you are new creatures in Christ: to wit, 1. Of
your dignity, that you are Gods sons, 1 John 3.1, 2. Christ brethren, Heb.
2.11. heavens heirs, James. 2.5. partakers of a high, and heavenly calling,
Heb. 3.1. 2. Of your liberty, that your are the Lords freemen, Cor. 7.22.
delivered out of the hands of all your enemies, 1 Samuel 12.11. 2 Kings. 17.39.
3. Of your victory, that you are through Christ more then Conquerors over all
the world of Creatures, 1 John. 5.4. of evils, of temptations, of persecutions,
Romans 8.35.37. 4. Of your safety, that you have almighty God for your place of
refuge, Psalm. 48.2. a hedge of providence, Job. 1.10. a Guard of angels, Psalm.
91.11. an enclosure of mercy, Psalm. 32.10. and Gods promise as a writ of
protection for your defense. Heb. 13.5.6. 5. Of your riches as durable
substance in heaven, Heb. 10.34. and incorruptible inheritance, 1 Pet. 1.4. a
kingdom of glory, and a crown of life, for you are heirs of God, and
co-heires with Christ. 6. Of your joy and pleasure, precious for kind, and
plentiful for measure, Psalm. 16.11. peace un-conceiveable, Phil. 4.7. joy
unspeakeable, 1. Pet. 1.8. the masters joy.


Get your hearts affected with all these as being yours. Chew, and suck them
by serious Meditation, work, and warm them on your hearts by close
application, rubbing them into your affections. Oppose these your spiritual
privileges to all your temporal pressures, setting the one against the other;
as your heavenly friends to your earthly foes, your high dignity in Christ to
your meaness in outward condition, your wealth above to your want below your
future joys and rest to your present troubles, and sorrows. This will make you
not only patient under the afflictions of this life, Romans 12.12. but also
joyful in them, Romans 5.3. and triumphant over them, 1. Cor. 15.55. Thus did the
Apostle, Rom 8.18. 2 Cor 4.17. and 6.8.9.10.

These will provoke to duty, 1 Peter. 2.9.11.12. and preserve from faining, 2
Cor. 4.16.17. and from trouble of heart, John. 14.1, 2.

Duty 8.
Sanctify God in your heart daily, 1 Pet. 1.15. make him your fear, Isaiah.
8.14. your love, and delights, Psalm. 37.4. To this end, 1. Have often high, and
honorable thoughts of God, serious meditations of his glorious Atributes, as
his wisdom, power, truth, mercy, Justice, etc. and work them upon your hearts,
that they may Echo to them with pure, and melting affections. This will
increase, and nourish up the divine nature in you, 2 Pet. 1.4. 2. Labor to be
affected with all the works of God, as first to behold, and admire the wisdom
of God in the creatures, Psalm. 136.5. 2 To see, and taste Gods goodness in every
mercy Psalm. 34.8. 3 To take notice of, and tremble at the anger, and
displeasure of God in all his Judgments, Psalm. 119.120. Habb. 3.16. 4 That you
may answer the dispensations of Gods providence with suitable dispositions; your
hearts carrying a counterpane in affection to all Gods actions, Isay. 26.8. 3.
Wrestle with God by praying, and believing for an heart of flesh, Ezekiel. 36.26.
which will receive impressions from the very thoughts of God in the mind. 4
Apply promises of particular affections: as first of love, Deuteronomy. 30.6. 2 of
fear, Ier. 32.40. 3 of delight, Isa. 58.14. There is heart, and life in the se
promises, sufficient to quicken and warm thy dead, and frozen affctions.


Duty 9.
Get a public spirit to mind the things of Jesus Christ, as naturally as if
they were your own things, Phil. 2.20, 21. to look on the things of others,
and prefer, first, Jerusalems welfare before your chiefest joy, Psalm. 137.5,
6. and 2. the Gospels liberty before your own, as Paul did, and to mourn for
the sins of the times, as the Godly in Jerusalem did, Ezekiel. 9.4. Especially lay
to heart, 1. The Churches misery, when Gods Ordinances go down, and
superstition goes up, when Gods cause and side are put to the worst; when any
thing falls out, which gives a blow to Religion, or proves an impediment to the
Gospel. If the Arc be taken, call your comforts Ichabods, 1 Samuel 4.2. 2. The
afflictions of Joseph, Amos 6.6. The sufferings of Gods servants, whether
Ministers or people. O sympathize with them, Heb. 13.3. Neb. 1.4. labor to
feel their troubles and sorrows at your very hearts; and pray earnestly for
them as the Church did for Peter, Act. 12.5. 3. The signs of the times, Mat.
16.3. which hypocrites cannot discern, though they be well versed in the face
of the Sky, to wit, the sad symptoms, and presages of approaching Judgments,
as, First, the commonnesse of sin; for all sorts transgress in all kind of
open sinfulnes with a high hand against the light of nature, and the means of
grace, Ezekiel. 12.3. 2 Contempt of Gods Ordinances, misusing of his Ministers, 2 Chronicles. 36.16. 3 Departure of Gods glory from his house, Ezekiel. 9.3. 4
Incorrigibenesse after former, and under present judgments, Lev. 26.14. to the
end of the chapter. 5. The death of many righteous men, Isaiah 57.1. the
carrying away of others to hiding places. 6 The vials of Gods wrath powered on
the Churches beyond the Seas, Ier. 17.12.14. 7 An inundation of spiritual
judgments, as a spirit of error, superstition, apostasy, etc. which do
commonly end in temporal plagues, Isa. 6.10, 11.



Now the Holy ghost is a public spirit breathing and acting in all the members
of the mystical body of Christ: Pray for it, Luke 11.13. believe for it, Gal.
3.14. Ezekiel. 36.37.

Duty 10.
Get your hearts weaned daily from the world, and from those creatures and
comforts in it, which are dearest and sweetest to you. As wife, children,
friends, goods, liberty house, life. This Christ requires of those that follow
him, Luke 14.26, 27. Mark 10.29, 30. this will prepare you either to suffer or
to die when God calls you to it. To this end consider seriously; 1. That these
things cannot satisfy your heart, when you have enjoyed them to the full,
Eccles. 4.8. and 5.10. you soon grow weary of them, or glutted with them, so
that you desire some new delights, or more of the old, or some over again. 2.
Nor can they sanctify you, but expose you often to many lusts, 1 Timothy 6.9, 10.
tentations, distractions, to a spirit of the world, and they hinder from
following Christ, Mat. 19.22. 3. Nor can they save you from Gods wrath, from
death or judgment, Prove. 11.4. 4. The wicked whose portion is only here, have
often the greatest share of them, Psalm. 17.14. Job. 21.7. to 14. 5. They serve
only for this life, whilst we are on this side of the grave; they shall not
be the least Ingredients into our celestial happiness. When we do come to be
happy in heaven, we shall stand in no need of food, raiment, physic,
marriage, etc. Mat. 22.30. for we shall be like the Angels of God in heaven, we
shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, Rev. 7.16. we shall live by the
all-sufficient Spirit of God, which never needs refreshing; we shall be clothed
with long white robes of immortality Rev. 7.9. In a word, when we come to
heaven the place of Gods Habitation, we shall enjoy the face, and beatificall
presence of the most glorious Jehovah, blessed for ever, as an object, wherein
all the powers of our souls will be satisfied with ineffable delight, and
everlastingnesse. God will be unto us all in all, 1 Cor. 15.28.
