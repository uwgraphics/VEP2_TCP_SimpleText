The Apprentices Lamentation, TOGETHER, With a doleful Elegy upon the manner
of the Death of that Worthy, and Val^rous Knight Sr. RICHARD WJSEMAN.
The Apprentices Lamentation for the death of Sir RICHARD WISEMAN.
THus died the Mirror of the times; whose Fate
We dare not murmr at, to expostulate,
And reason with the Deity, t, were sin,
Nor dare we wish the act undone again,
With brows contracted and with moistened eyes
It Is lawful to lament his Obsequies.
And not to praise his Worth were to detract
Here an omission would be thought an Act
Of base Ingratitude; and yet who knows
To Express his real worth in Verse or Prose,
Rhethorique's too barren, and all words to few
To shadow forth those Praises that are due
To his blessed memory, since we cannot praise
Enough his matchless Virtue; we will raise
Our meditations, let our thoughts aspire,
And what we cannot praise enough; admire:
And least we seem t'envie thy blessed State,
(Blessed to eternity) by our too late
Laments. We'ele stop the floudgates of our eyes,
And cease to weep for thy sad Obsequies.
Stop our tears current, and forbear to moan,
And turn our grief to imitation.
ELEGIES on the Death of Sr. RICHARD WISEMAN.
AND shall the Fates thus uncontrould
Rob us of that which we do hold
Most sacred, must pure Virtue be
The Subject of their cruelty.
Will not their too impious hand
Be swai'd by Wis^domes counter manned*
Cursed be the worthless man that threw
The fatal stone, sure he well knew
His Valor, that he durst not try
A Combat for the Victory,
But had he known his Wisdom too
He would not then have dared to do,
An Act so horrid unto one,
Who came so near Perfection.
But it was thy Fate (dece^sed Friend) to be
Th'untimely Subject of his cruelty;
What direful Fate soever stops his breath,
Yet see the Wiseman triumphs in his Death.
