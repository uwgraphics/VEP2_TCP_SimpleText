THE Authors, Nature, and Danger OF HAERESIE.

Laid open in a Sermon Preached before the Honorable House of Commons at
Margarets Westminster, upon Wednesday the Tenth of March 1646. being set apart
as a solemn day of Public Humiliation to seek Gods assistance for the
suppressing and preventing of the growth and spreading of Errors, Heresies,
and Blasphemies.

TO THE HONORABLE House of COMMONS Assembled in Parliament.
THe Compass of the subject entreated upon in this Sermon was too large to be
surveied in a short time. The nature of Haeresy lies under much obscurity and
inevidence. The Infidel who comes not in at all, And the Apostate who goes out
at all are visible enough to the eye, but the Haereticke who like a cunning
Bankerupt breaks with some stock in his hand, and holds some planks of truth
when the ship is broken, is more hardly to be known. I have not spoken much
about the punishment of an Haereticke, but rather chose to show you who he is
then what to do with him. There are good rules for the Church her proceeding
against such. men, which may also serve very fitly to the meridian of your
jurisdiction, as namely, in peccatis evidentiam, in paenis aedificationem; and
again, nec cito in apertis, nec unquam in ambiguis, with many other, which lay
on the other side of the hedge from my way which was toward the investigation
of the nature of Haeresie, wherein I hope that what I have offered shall be
interpreted with candor, for it was not my meaning to speak thunder and
lightning, but to speak to the enlightening of the minds of the auditory, and
not to the burning of Haereticks bodies; if any man please to compare my
language with that style wherein the holy scripture speaks of false teachers
and their corrupting men's minds, I doubt not but that I shall be found not
guilty of railing, whereof I have already been indicted in print, but I must
make amends for a long Sermon with a short Epistle; and therefore in a word, Be
quick (Noble Gentlemen) in settling the interest of Christ in this Kingdom. God
has paid you well aforehand, if that do not set an edge upon you, yet be
confident that he has somewhat behind remaining yet in his hand, which he
will not part with until he see your work for him in some forwardness, and
the longer the yarne hangs in the loome, the more it is ravelled, you have
been told that you have nothing to do in the reformation of the Church, give
not the world occasion to suspect that you think so too, but go on with God,
and prosper, and the Lord make your way plain before your face,

So prays Your most humble servant in Christ Jesus RICHARD VINES.

A SERMON Preached before the Honorable House of COMMONS at Margarets
Westminster, on the tenth of March 1646. being a day of public Humiliation
for the growth of Errors, Heresies, etc.
2. PETER 2. 1. But there were false Prophets also among the People, even as
there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable
Heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves
swift destruction.
BY a Declaration set forth above Thirty His Majesty's declaration in the cause
of C^nradus V^r stius Printed in English. Anno 1612.
years ago, King James (of Famous memory) was pleased to let the world know not
only how ill he resented, and how much he detested the Vorstian and Arminian
Doctrines, then newly borne, and in their swadlingcloathes: but also how
solicitously he interposed with the States General of the United Provinces
against their admittance of Vorstins into the place of Divinity professor at
Leiden, or into their country; And that he might decline the envy of being in
aliena republica curiosus, he bears himself upon that common rule paries cum
proximus ardet, when a neighbors house is on fire it concerns all in the
neighborhood to look about them, this vigilance condemns our (I know not what
to call it, I wish no worse might be said then) insensiblenesse and security.
For what were those sparks at that time smoking in a remote corner in
comparison of that fire which now flames forth at every corner of our house,
blown up by that (...) or liberty of all religions, which may be justly called
the golden Calfe of these times, Where unto many are not unwilling to
contribute their strength and policy, and whose birthday they would not fear
to call festum Jehovae an acceptable day unto the Lord. Are not the errors
which are rife amongst us, either by infecting persons of place and quality
grown into that boldness? or by carrying away Barnabas also crept into that
credit? or by spreading far and wide risen to that strength? that they do
face, if not seem able to put into danger of rowting, our common faith, public
worship, authorized ministry, long and much expected and promised reformation.
This to the common enemy is the Cape of good hope, the sound part are afraid
least the truth should come to beg for poor quarter, and be led Captive
following the Chariot of triumphant liberty, some think that episcopacy in his
pontificalibus may by this means be retrived, and recalled from exile to which
it was sentenced by the Covenant, many that are as distant in their opinions as
the two poles, yet moveing up on one axletree, or tied together by the tails
of Common interest, Doubt not but by laying their stocks together, they shall
be able to bid fair for a Toleration. And that we might not be left alone to
wonder at our selves, our sympathizing brethren abroad do wonder also, That we
should be made the common sewre to receive the garbage of other Churches, and
that their stinking snuffes should be allowed candlesticks here in England.

In this sad posture of things, All men's eyes have been upon the Parliament,
and every one says Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no Physician there?
why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? And the
truth is neither your diversion by sudden and difficult emergents, nor wisdom
in not disobliging any party, has been able to satisfy the godly jealousies
of many, until they espied this day break of hope given to them by your
declaration, in which you take notice of a double bond or obligation that lies
upon you.

1. The first is the bond of your solemn Covenant: It will do very much good
abroad when men shall see that you feel the obligation of that Covenant which
some do widen into such a latitude of sense and consequently into such a
looseness, that they may be easily said to keep that which hardly any man can
break; This additionall fast is an additionall bond also. For it cannot be
(without further peril to you) both a fast and a loose too.

2. The second is the bond of Gods mercies, miracles rather, in bringing you
clear out of the fiery furnace and therefore less you cannot do than
Nebuchadnezzar, who being convinced, and astonished by the miraculous
deliverance of the three servants of the Lord, made a decree that none should
speak any (...) paraphr. ^osephi. (...) inepti quid.
error against the God of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego, because there is no
other God that can deliver after this sort. Dan. 3. 29. I crave leave for this
prefaceing, It is only to bid this day welcome, because as it is the first that
ever was in England upon this sad occasion, so it is a new and strong
engagement and demonstration of your zeal and resolution to endeavor, to
draine these fens which have so over spread the face of Gods Church.

The Apostle in the latter end of the foregoing chapter recommends to
Christians the holy Scriptures as the fixed pole and un-varying compass by
which they should steer their course, It seems he knew nothing of any such
high form of Christians in the School of Christ which should (as I may say)
be got above the Scriptures or have learned beyond them. For the commends them
who had obtained like precious faith with himself and others of highest rank.
2 Pet. 1. 1. for giving heed to the word of prophecy verse. 19. and as appears
by that expression ver. 20. (...), knowing this first, He would have it laid
down as a principle, and set as a strong fort against the battery of all false
teachers That no prophecy of Scripture is of any private sense or (...) is the
unfolding or clearing of things dark and doubtful, Mar. 4. 34. (...) Acts 19.
39. (...)
interpretation. because it came not by the will of man, but holy men of God
spoke as they were carried by the holy Ghost. The settling of this principle,
and the fastening of Christians, or as it were nailing them unto the Scriptures;
the words of the holy Prophets and Apostles, is the scope at which the Apostle
collimes in this Epistle, as himself declares, Chap. 3. verse. 1, 2. and 17.
And that it might appear to them how necessary and seasonable it was to stir
them up to adhere to the sure word of God, and the true and genuine sense
thereof, He foretells the coming in of False teachers and Scoffers, False
teachers that would overthrow the truth of doctrine, which is according to
godliness, by bringing in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought
them, chap. 2. ver. 1. Scoffers that would undermine and elude the truth of
Gods promises. There shall come in the last days Scoffers, walking after their
own lusts, and saying, where is the promise of his coming, Chap. 3. verse. 3,

rack, the Apostle gives a double character of such as would crooken it, or
make it look (...), Sylburg.
a squint, and they are the unlearned and unstable, and so concludes with
caution to all Christians, that they should beware, lest they being carried
away together, by the seducement of wicked men, or ((...)) lawless Libertines
of opinion and practice, fall from their own steadfastness, Chap. 3. verse. 16,
17.

In this Chapter the Apostle foretells the coming of false teachers into the
Gospel Churches, and describes their doctrines, their destruction, their
manners.

The doctrines which they teach are damnable heresies, they deny the Lord that
bought them.

Their destruction is exemplified and paralleld in three terrible examples, the
casting down of the Angels that fell, the destruction of the old world, the
overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrha. It may make the ears of all haeresie-Masters
and their followers to tingle when they hear that the three great and famous
monuments of Gods sore wrath executed by his own immediate hand are brought in
as examples of his vengeance against that wickedness which above all other
pretends exemption and liberty from the stroke of men.

Their manners (in the description of which the greatest part of this Chapter
is taken up) are drawn out in so foul colors, that every man may make the
observation, That monstrous doctrines are accompanied with monstrous lusts.

In this verse you have the seedes-men, and they are false teachers; the seed
they sow, namely damnable heresies. The crop they shall reap, and that is swift
destruction.

In the first part which shows us the seeds-men, there are two points to be
taken up.

1. That there shall be false teachers in the Gospel Churches, as there were
false Prophets in the Church of old.

2. That these false teachers are they that bring in damnable heresies.

There shall be false teachers (...) amongst you in the Churches of the
Gospel, as there were false prophets (...) among the people of God of old.
It Is seldom seen that false prophets or false teachers will own their own
name: go from one to one and ask, are you a false teacher? and there will not
be found any; the confident false prophet puts it upon the true Prophet that
He is the false. Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak to
thee? 1 Kings 22. 24. which is the false prophet we shall see anon, in the
mean time thus far we are agreed, that there were such then, and that there
shall be such amongst Christians under the Gospel, though they that are
guilty are wiser than to make such a description of a false teacher, or of
haeresy which may hit themselves: but rather will use their slight to turn
the Scripture* as one does a right hand glove to fit the other hand.

False Prophets and false teachers are paralleld, both in their being in the
Church, and in their character or description.

1. In their Being in the Church, for

1. As God then sent Prophets to teach his people* Jer. 7. 25. Since the day
that your Fathers come forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day, I have
sent you all my servants the Prophets, and there were then false prophets also
says my Text. So God has set in his Church under the Gospel Teachers, 1 Cor.
12. 28. and there shall be also false teachers; then they wore a rough garment
to deceive, and now they corn in sheeps clothing. The Apostle in this Zech.
13. 4. Matthew. 7. 15.
Text determines not the false Prophets then to a particular place or time, but
says they were among the people; nor does he determine false teachers now to
any one place or time, but speaks indefinitely, they shall be amongst you.
There is no age of the Church free of them: only the last days are most
likely to have most of these dregs; and whereas its said of all true Prophets,
that they were sent, and of Pastors and Teachers, that God has set them in,
and Christ has given them to his Church; there is no more said of these in the
Text than (...). They were, and they shall be: they may easily find a Prophecy
for their being in the Church, but will hardly find a Scripture-warrant or
calling.

2. As the Church of old, notwithstanding those living oracles of truth, the
holy men of God who spoke as they were moved by the holy Ghost, and the lively
oracles of holy Scripture committed to it, had false Prophets also, who spoke
their own dreams: so the Gospel Churches even in the Apostles times, 1 John
4. 1. and not withstanding the fullness and perspicuity of Evangelicall
doctrine given by inspiration of God, shall have false teachers in them; Who
shall come up in Samuels mantle, and putting the Scriptures to the rack, shall
(...) (as one says of Philo) force things into allegories and conceited
extractions, and make them like Anaxagoras his (...) drawing every thing out of
any thing. For an haereticall wit is a strange Chemist. The truth is, the
resisters of the truth, and the seducers in the old Testament are but acted
over again in the Gospel Churches. Here also are the resistings of Jannes and
Jambres, by men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith, 2 Timothy 3. 8.
Here are the contradictions of Core, Jude. verse. 11. Here is the doctrine of
Balaam, Rev. 2. 14. and here are the false teachers answering to the false
Prophets, but yet it is argued by some that the Analogy between the Old and
New Testament, does not hold in regard of the punishment of false Prophets and
blasphemers, nor ought to be drawn into consequence now. I would they would
rather study to avoid the same sins, then to evade the like punishments: for
the greater liberty of Conscience under the Gospel, cannot extenuate the sin
of blasphemy, because this liberty is accompanied with greater light.

2. In their Character or description. The Greek which has great felicity of
composition of words calls him in one word a false prophet, whom the Hebrew
calls a Prophet, and leaves him by spurious characters or properties to be
detected false or illegitimate.

A false prophet or a false teacher may be so denominated in a two fold respect.

1. As he teaches or vents lies and false-hood, which is the most usual and
common acceptance of the word.

2. As he teaches without a commission or calling. Ier. 14. 14. Esaias 9. 15.
Ezec. 13. 2. etc.


1. In the first notion he is a false prophet that teaches lies, or delivers
forth the visions and deceit of his own heart, which he covers over with Thus
says the Lord Ezech. 13. 6. Ier. 28. 2. and so fathers his false dreams upon
God, and his chiefest aim and care is not to sting the people, but to feed his
deluded followers with pleasing things, and rather to tickle than to prick
them, Saying to Ahab, go up and prosper, 1 King. 22. 12. or God has broken the
yoke of Babylon, Jer. 28. 2. which was the advantage that Ahabs false prophets
had of Micajab, and Hananiah had of Jeremy, and this observation the Scripture
makes upon them, Thy prophets have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away
thy captivity. Lam. 2. 14. and they think to cause my people to forget my
name. Ier. 22. 27. Whence it is that they are applauded and that all men speak
well of them Luke 6 26. They are wiser then to mar their own markets by
sharp reproves, as a cutpurse is afraid to touch the quick with his knife
lest he loose his prey.

The character of false teachers is answerable, they are (...)
Lying masters speaking perverse things to Drus. praet. in 2 Pet. 2. 1.
draw Disciples after them. Acts. 20. 30. and speaking lies in hypocrisy, which
they palliate over with It is written, or the name of the spirit, and are
therefore called spirits of error 1. Tim. 4. 1. as we are forbidden to believe
every spirit. 1. John. 4. 1. that is every doctrine though pretended to be from
the spirit, for men are cunning to lay down their bastards at an honest door,
and to pin them upon the back of scripture; being like to the false prophets
in this mis-fathering of their doctrines, as also in that other thing, which is
the bayteing of their hooks with sweet and pleasing baytes. (...) they allure
as with a bait through the lusts of the flesh and wantonness. 2. Pet. 2. 18.
And they promise liberty ver. 19. which are taking things, that it is no
wonder there are many that follow their pernicious ways. ver. 2.

2. In the second notion he is a false prophet who Jer. 14. 14. Ezech. 13. 6.
runs indeed but is not sent, I have not sent these prophets yet they ran Ier.
23. 22. They can say I have dreamed, I have dreamed, ver. 25. but they have no
mission, and such a one is to be counted a false prophet. Molin. Vates cap. 4.
Sive vera praedicet sive falsa whether he preach true or false; The character
of a false teacher is answerable hereunto, he is one that is (...), self
called, or fills his own hand, so that the question is not what he teaches but
by what warrant, as Cyprian Cyprian in Epistola ad Antonianum.
said once to one that was inquisitive what doctrine Novatian did teach, we
need not (says he) be careful or curious to know quid ille doceat cum soris
dote, the like may be justly said of false teachers. Its no asking what they
teach since they have no calling (...).
to teach, There are found in the new Testament, (I had almost said in England)
False Christ's, false Apostles, false Prophets, false teachers, all these ranks
are counterfeited, as he is called a false Christ, a false Apostle, who
pretends to be Christ or an Apostle and is not, so is he a false teacher who
pretends to be a teacher and is not sent. Nor is it any wonder that when once
men do begin to look for a new Christ, or new Apostles, or new Prophets, they
should in the next place fall to making of them, that so their seeking may not
seem frustrate, but because some are of opinion that preaching of the word is
not so much an act of office as of gifts, and that gifts and talents do carry
with them letters patents of commission to trade with them, I must crave leave
to bestow a few words upon it, because it has been generally received in the
Church that both matter and form, mission and vision, gifts and calling must
concur to the constitution of him who exercises a public ministry. For even
our Lord Jesus Christ in whom all fulness dwells: glorified not himself to
be made a high Priest, but was called of God as was Aaron. Heb. 5. 4. 5. and
the rule is there given, that no man takes (...) an honor or office to
himself, whatsoever be his parts or abilities, and the apostle says not how
should they (...), publicly preach the word, without gifts, and abilities?
but, except they be sent Romans 10. 15. It must not be denied, that every member
in the body has (...), his proper office, Romans 12. 4. 5. whereby it may
contribute to the good and edification of the whole. The word of God that
dwells in any, ought to diffuse it self for the benefit of others, in their
families, relations, and conversations. The talent which God has given to
every one is to be put forth to use, the Samaritan woman may call out her
neighbors to Christ, and the shepeards may spread abroad what they have heard
of him, though they be but shepherds and neither priests nor Levites, but
every starr in his own orb or Sphaere, Bellarm. de ecclesia militante.
diversa est ratio membri and instrumenti publici there is a difference
between a private member of the Church, and a public instrument. For all the
freemen of this City or corporation are not Aldermen, and the edification of
the body by ministry, and by membership are plainly distinguished, Ephesians. 4. ver
11. and 16. If every Phaeton that thinks himself able may drive the chariot
of the sun no wonder if the world be set on fire, I should not doubt to say,
that as in some cases Omnis homo miles against a sudden assaulter or invader,
every man is a soldier, so, as the case may be, omnis Christianus Evangelista
every Christian is an Evangelist, as Edesius and Frumentius published the
Gospel to the Indies, and the woman to the Iberians, as the Ecclesiastical
story S^crates lib. 1. chap. 15. 16. Theod r. lib. ^ chap 23.
reports, And it is said Acts. 8 4. those that were dispersed by the
persecution against the Church at Jerusalem, went every where preaching the
word, They disseminated the knowledge of Christ, to the ignorant Jews and
Hellenists. Acts. 11. 20. the circumstance defends the action, if it could be
proved that these dispersed Christians were private men and that they preached
the word in Jerusalem which was a constituted Church, before they were
scattered Mornay du pl^ss^s of the Church, ch 11.
thence, it would be some thing to the purpose, The noble Mornay puts another
case, that if the sentinells be in a dead sleep any common soldier or man, may
give the alarm to the City, as when the dogs do not bark the geese do save
the capitol, and yet it remains good, that there is an office, in the hands
whereof Christ has lodged the stewardship of the mysteries of God, the word
and sacraments, for teaching and baptizing are both put into the same hand; It
is not a man's able parts which make him the steward of any of your houses, but
your committing the keys into his hand. Nor abilities, but commission, which
makes an Ambassador, what if a Gibeonite or any other man was able, and had
the skill to dress a sacrifice, and perform all the outward work thereabout
as well as any Priest, Must he therefore take upon him to usurp the Priests
Office? I think none will say it, No constituted Church either under the Law or
Gospel can be denied to have had Officers appointed for the work of the
Ministry and dispensation of the holy things of God; As concerning the Church
under the Law who can doubt of it? And for the Churches under the Gospel that
they should be constituted and founded by Christ and the Apostles who were
sent, (for its said John 20. 21.) As my Father has sent me, so send I you) and
then that all sending should determine and cease, as if Christ had given
Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, but no Pastors, and Teachers, can enter into
no man's head, till sense and reason be first gone out of it; what else should
be the meaning of those words, (...)
Elders, Rulers, Bishops, Pastors, Governors, which are contradistinguisht to
the Community of the Church. As the Elders and whole Church Acts 15. Rulers and
Saints, Heb. 13. verse 24. Angels and Churches, Revel. 1. 20. and the one sort
are said to Rule and govern. The other enjoined to submit and obey them, Heb.
13. 17. for so doubtless Christ has formed this house of his, as other houses
are; This City as other cities, this body or commonwealth as other societies.
That is, to consist of such as govern and such as are Governed: for otherwise
it would be more like a Cyclops den then an ordered family. If any shall say
that (...) and (...) do signify nothing but one that carries the lantern of
doctrine, or goes before others by good example, let him sayalso that a Master
or a father of a family does (...), 1. Tim. 3. 4. 5. give but a good example,
to his house, as a very servant may do, or that Joseph was set (...). Acts. 7.
10. a good example to Egypt, and no more, The word (...), to preach is in the
new testament most usually and for the most part appropriated to preaching by
office and authority, and when the Apostle says 1. Tim. 2. 12. I permit not a
woman to teach (...) nor to exercise authority (as the word f Docere est actus
poteslatis. Calvin in lo^^^.
signifies) it is plainly signified that to teach in the Church is an act of
authority; those then to whom the Apostle commended the oversight of the Church
at his farewell. Acts. 20. 28. to whom Peter wrote and charged them with the
flock 1. Pet. 5. 1. whom the golden Candlesticks had for their Angels, and
upon whom that comfortable promise is entaild, I will be with you always unto
the end of the world, Matthew. 28. 20. are men in office, not indeed called unto
Lordship and dominion, but to a ministry and stewardship which is to be
regulated by that most excellent rule and to that only end For your
edification and not for your destruction 2. Cor. 10. 8.

But this office is undermined and pulled down by piece-meale, stone by stone,
as if a man should say this stone is not essential to the house, nor this nor
that, and so pull all down at last. This is a stratagem of the Socinian art;
It is said that imposition of hands in ordination is but a ceremony, or
formality, and in it self a cyphar; and being so why may it not be laid aside
as well as that ceremony of laying the Bible on the head, which is spoken of in
the Council. Carthagin 4. c. 2.
counsel of Carthage? concerning imposition of hands in the general this I
say that it is not a thing to be slighted as an outward rite incongruous to the
spiritualnesse of the Gospel for its one of those which the Apostle calls the
doctrine of the beginning of Christ and the foundation, Heb. 6. 1. 2. and for
the particular place it has in ordination, let it first be settled and agreed
that the ministry being an office or calling has some way of entrance into it
appointed by him that has appointed the office, and that there is a separation
of men thereunto, or manner of their constitution and ordination, that is, a
potestative mission as some express it: and then the modus is to be inquired
into as touching which, it is argued that ordination by imposition of hands as
contradistinguisht from the election of the people is not essential to the
manner of entrance. Es-sentiall is a great word. Baptism and the Lords supper
are not essential to the being of a Christian or to salvation; so as the
privation of them should damn the soul, and yet are of excellent use and
clear institution. It may suffice, that there is so much in the word for
ordination as that the way of the word in that case is neither to be laid aside
nor receded from, nor maimed. The engine planted for battery and overthrow of
ordination is the election of the people that is the id ipsum wherein the
separation of a man to the ministry does consist, and yet we read of a
separation unto God for the work of the ministry by fasting, prayer, and
imposition of hands, without any election of people, Act. 13. 1. 2. I am of
Lib. de rep eccl. 2. cap. 2. para^ 12.
Spalato his mind that this was not a separation to an office which Paul and
Barnabas before had not, but that it was a separation unto God ((...)) for the
work of the Ministry, is clear enough, and what was that work, but the
preaching of the word and ordaining of elders. Acts. 14. 23. 24. 25. 26. If any
man can show throughout the New Testament that any did impose hands for
separation of men to the office or work of the ministry but only such as were
in office themselves, Apostles, Evangelists, Eldership, and these Teachers and
Prophets at Antioch, or that the election of the people is the id ipsum of
separation, let it be done, or let us have less dictating and less begging,
for by the way let me tell you, we live in the beggarliest age that ever was,
I mean for begging of the question.

And if the mere election of the people be sufficient, what need was there
that the Apostle should leave Titus in Crete, for this cause, that he might
ordain Elders in every City, Titus 1. 5. For if it be said that (...), that
thou might ordain, be no more then that thou might ordain, be no more
then that thou might look on while the people did it, Then why may not
Pharaoh (of whom it is said (...), he constituted Joseph Governor over
Egypt) be said to look on only, while the people did it. And what need was
there that Paul and Barnabas should be separated and sent forth to ordain
Elders in every Church, Acts 14. 23. If the Churches election had been the id
ipsum of ordination; And why are the characters and qualifications of Elders
and Bishops given and described to Timothy and Titus, 1 Timothy 3. Tit. 1. Not so
much to the people, by which they should proceed in their elections, as to
them who were appointed to ordain them, that they might not lay on hands
suddenly, 1 Timothy 5. 22. In which place laying on of hands (as (...) with the
Hebrews) is put for ordination, and so is not election by the people any where
found to be. As for Cases and instances of a people cast up in some remote
Island or the like: may not they choose a Minister? and he perform the office
without ordination? such cases may be formed to overthrow any common rule or
law of Ministry or Magistracy either. It Is said that an Exceptio firmat
regulam in non exceptis.
exception strengthens a rule, and overthrows it not, for then there could be
no rule of any thing, because every rule has some exception; set the
Heteroclites by themselves, and let the rule stand. If David eat the
Shewbread, or the Levites perform that office which belongs to the Priests (2 Chronicles. 29. 34. with Levit. 1. 6.) in case of necessity; there is no more can be
said but necessitas quod cogit, defendit, that which necessity commands, it
defends.

That the holy Ghost was given by the imposition of the Apostles hands; (I say
the Apostles) Act. 8. 18. is true: but no argument against laying on of hands
by the Eldership in ordination, for there were diverse reasons and occasions of
laying on of hands besides in ordination: and other hands were laid on in
ordination, than could give the holy Ghost. The Levites had imposition of hands
( Fagius in Chald. paraph. in locum.
tanquam in sacrificium, Numb. 8. 10, 11. as upon a sacrifice) dedicating them
to God and his service. And so in the New Testament, it was used for separation

grace seems somewhere to be put for office, as Romans 1. 5. See Romans 1. 5* and

election by the people, which is by some cried up as the All in All in this
point, though I have nothing to say against the lawfullnesse of it, where it is
duly conditioned: yet if any shall plead the necessity of it as essential to
the calling of a Minister, I should not stick to say, that there is clearer
evidence in Scripture for ordination of Ministers by imposition of hands, then
for election by the people. That word, (...), Acts 14. 23. out of which it is
expiscate, after a man has made the best of it, will leave him to beg the
question, for there appears in it no act of the Church at all: but whatsoever

Elders for the Disciples, and therefore without endangering not only the sense,

Elders, did they ordain by imposition of hands? as the word (...) signifies in
the Greek Fathers and counsels who may be thought to understand the language)
It is not unlikely that those very men that had been sent forth upon this
expedition by imposition of hands, fasting and prayer should in the like manner
ordain Elders, for so the very te^^ in hand couples together, ordaining of
Elders in every Church and praying with fastings; or did they elect Elders for
them? as Grotius in locum.
Grotius seems to interpret it, but those that contend for that sense of the
word, to signify election, will not easily digest the interpretation, and the
truth is, They that argue the peoples election of Ministers, from the election
of the seven, Acts. 6. which the Apostles permitted to the people there, cannot
easily grant that Paul and Barnabas did assume it to themselves here, because
it gives away the question, namely election by the people; or did Paul and
Barnabas join with the Disciples in election? If it had been said (...) it had
been something to the purpose, but it is not said they chose with them, but
they ordained for them Elders in every Church, And for that which Grotius
says, Credibile est etc. I'ts to be thought that the consent of the people
went along also, the reason that he gives, namely because in a lesser matter
their consent was sometime taken in, quite overthrowes that which is contended
for ex vt verbi out of the word (...), used in the text, and we know that where
the Apostles, Elders, and Brethren concurred in an act they are all named Acts.
15. 23. which as here it is not said so it cannot hence be proved; or in the
last place, if it be said that the word translated, ordain, signifies an
ordination upon a previous or antecedent election of the people, then 'its
clear that election does not thrust out ordination nor the act of the people
justle out the act of Paul and Barnabas, and so that engine works not by this
Text, which is so much clearer for ordination than election, as the act of Paul
and Barnabas is more express then that couchant act of the people, which is
pretended to lie hid in the same word: which if it be taken in one simple
sense, signifying either generally to constitute or ordain, and so relate to
the act of Paul and Barnabas, (without thrusting into the notion of the word
either imposition of hands (which may be made good elsewhere in Scripture to
have been used in ordination, or election by the people, which cannot be made
good elsewhere) or signifying election by suffrage, and so relate both to Paul
and Barnabas and the people, as if they all concurred in election or vote, and
that was all they did: both these significations the word will bear, though
not the Text: but if it carry twins in the belly of it, and import two diverse
acts different in kind, and so relate to some act of Paul and Barnabas,
differing from the act or suffrage of the people, then must that signification
be proved by good examples, lest it be found never to have been so used
before Luke used it so: but I hold my hand from further prosecution of this
Scripture, and offer to you one observation more, tending to clear the point
in hand, and that is out of Acts 6. where it is clear that there was an
election of the seven, and as clear, that the constitution or ordination of
them was reserved unto the Apostles, verse. 6. Look ye out seven men whom we
may appoint or constitute over this business; the people elected, the Apostles
ordained, verse. 3. and 5. But the election is not called the constitution or
ordination, for that the Apostles are said to do: and how did they do it?
verse. 6. when they had prayed they laid their hands on them, ordination by
imposition of hands was the constitutive act. The peoples (...) ver. 6. and the
Apostle (...) ver. 3. are not all one: that poor criticisme would never have
been borne, if the Diatrib p 10.

but presented them to be constituted and ordained by them over that business

If you please to consult the practice of antiquity in the point of election of
Bishops ab ordine and plebe (as they use to say) by the Church officers and
community, you shall find 1. That election was never set so high as to give
check to ordination, nor accounted that wherein the mission or sending did
consist: but as a preparative to ordination by way of good testimony of the
person to be ordained. 2. When you have searched all records (as Spalato derep.
eccles. lib. 3. cap. 3.
they are laid together by a very learned hand) the result and sum will be
this, that election had the force only of a nomination, presentation,
postulation, or consent, so as a Minister could not be obtruded invitae
ecclesiae upon a Church whether it would or no* if they were able to put in a
just exception against him, for which end the person to be ordained was first
to be proclaimed, or (as I may say) asked in (...). Council. Chalced. can. 6.

speech, that the people principally have power to choose the worthy, or refuse
the unworthy, is rendered in the same Epistle, that they do fully know the life
and conversation of every man. And therefore it is Diatrib. cap. 11.
injudiciously spoken that ordination necessarily follows election: for an
irrational or mere arbitrary dissent, when no just exception could be put in
bar against a man, could no more hinder a man's ordination, then such a
peevishness now a* days can hinder the marriage of one whose name is published
in the congregation. Ab ordinatoribus plebs docenda non sequenda, says
Caelestinus.

The cloze of this point might well have been an Apology for speaking so much
of it in this place, had not the Text led me to say something, and the
necessity of the times, together with the present occasion constrained me to
this prolixity. For the office of the Ministry, and the power thereunto
belonging, are very much undervalued, and laid very low by many: who differing
among themselves in principles, do as in a common interest, join together to
cry down and degrade them, In order to a twofold liberty. The one is the
liberty of prophesying or preaching, as any man is able to set up the trade: in
opposition to which they conceive the Ministers do stand for their own livings
and power sake. The other is the liberty of their lusts and ways of looseness,
and these are such upon whom the fear of the Ministry is fallen, whose Spirit
cannot bear too free reproof, nor their courses a too close observation. And
hence it is that some of them having learning, do set their wits on work to
rout this office and the power thereof, by bafling the evidences of the word,
and endeavoring to dispute the Scripture out of doors, which though God has
not pleased to deliver Systematically in a way of absolute precept or
demonstrative clearness in every particular, yet ought to be regarded in the
hints and consequences and implications which afford foot-hold to a good
conscience, and not to be out-wrangled for our ends and lusts sake, as being
the beck of that great God who is able to becken us all into nothing, others
that calculate by the Ephemerides of policy, do discover or imagine future
inconveniences, which may arise from the indiscretion, passion, weakness of
the Ministers, and if they will but go on to play that Cannon a little
further, they shall find it will batter and overthrow all Magistracy, or any
government that is managed by men; others whose tongues are sharper then their
arguments fall foul upon the ministry, and pour treble contempt upon it, in
lieu of double honor, never was ministry more blessed and witnessed unto from
heaven, by the success and fruitfullnesse of it in bringing in and bringing
up, a people unto God, (though some of their chickens are caught and carried
away by kites or have forsaken them, as duckes forsake the hen that hatched
them) never more contemned That which thef Collat. Carthag. 3.

that has but half an eye may see the reason why the Wolves would have the
Sheep to quitt their dogs. The ministry if encouraged and supported to do
their duty, will be (next under the Parliament, who, we hope, will do theirs)
the greatest bulwark or bank against the inundation of error, haeresy, and
blasphemy, whose increase is the occasion of this humiliation; It is the lot of

by Bishops. The same conclusion is now undertaken; That the present Ministers
in this Church are not lawful Ministers, upon a medium quite contrary, that
is, because they were ordained by Bishops, nor are those who are ordained by
Presbyters, in much better account with the objectours, for they are in the
same line of pedigree, being but once more removed from the stock,

learned men, who have distinguished between the corruptions in the persons
ordaining or in the fieri of ordination, and the substance and validity of
ordination in facto esse, and the very same answers which were made for the
first reformers and the Ministers ordained by them, are of as full force for
the Ministers now in being with us, and the Ministers ordained by them, nor can
our Ministry fall by this argument now used against us, without the fall of
all ministry in the Churches of Christ in all times and places where Bishops
had a hand in ordination, and if the Scripture do settle the power of
ordination in a Presbytery or in the Elders of the Church, it can never be made
good, that a Bishops hand (who is also a presbyter) being joined with others,
can anull the ordination, as neither is Baptism a nullity because administered
by a Bishop and happily with some corrupt ceremony used in the administration
thereof.

I proceed to the second point which I will touch but briefly and reserve the
use of both and of that which follows until the close of all.

These false teachers are they that bring in damnable Heresies, Stuprant
veritatem adulterio haeretico. Tertull. de praescript.
They defloure the truth by haereticall adultery not only those that teach
without commission, but such as have a calling to teach do by doctrines of
error bring in damnable haeresies, as its said Acts. 20. 30. Also of your own
selves, shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw Disciples after
them-They called Paul (because he was a zealous teacher of the Gospel) a
ringleader of the sect of the Nazarens, Acts. 24. 5. (...) signifies one that
is the first man of the rank, it is a military word, and I wish that our
military men had not transfused error into the several parts of our body. If
it be said that many of those who are charged with teaching of errors or
haeresy are holy men, I answer that a holy man cannot easily be a haeretick,
nor are all the errous of holy men to be called haeresy though they may be Hay
and Stubble upon the foundation, but it has been observed of old that some
haeresiarchs or heads of haeresy have been well reputed for strictness and
unblameablenesse of life: we learn out of Austine, that Pelagij nomen non sine
laud aliqua posui quia vita ejus a multis praedicabatur. Retract. lib. 2. cap.
33.
Pelagius had a very good testimony, and Scripture tells us they come in Sheeps
clothing and speak lies in hypocrisy. Lies would not take, if they were not
co^^ended by the holiness of the person, and gilded over as a rotten nutmegge
with gold, There is a (...) or transformation of Satan into an Angel of light,
of false Apostles into the Apostles of Christ, of Satan's Ministers into the

praescip.
faith by the person but of the person by the faith. Truth may be as a Jewel
in a dunghill, and error carried (as Hanniball carried his poison) in a
Gold-ring, That horse of superstition and idolatry, upon the back of which the
Devil has in former times made war against the Church is slain under him,
and now he is mounted upon a fresh horse of another color, called liberty of
opinion, falsely called liberty of conscience, Lets not be ignorant of his
devices.

I pass on to the second part of the text. The seed which these false teachers
do sow, and the text says They shall privily bring in damnable haeresies even
denying the Lord that bought them, in which words we take up these three
things.

1. That haeresies are damnable.

2. That damnable haeresies are brought in privily.

3. That those which bring them in do evendeny the Lord that bought them.

I shall first open these in few words, and then come to the investigation or
searching out what haeresie is, which is here by the Apostle called damnable.

1. First you see that haeresies are said to be damnable or destructive.
Haeresies of destruction as its said, Psa. 5. 6. (...) a man of bloods, that is
a bloody man: but why should haeresies be emphatically called haeresies of
destruction? for is not all sin of damnable guilt? and is not death the wages
(...) sin as sin? Its true; And yet as Judas that was an Apostle, and an
eminent Disciple of Christ, and betrayed and sold him for money, is called,
John 17. 12. (...) the son of destruction, and as the Antichrist is also
called, 2 These. 2. 3. the man of sin, the son of destruction, because under
Christ's name and colors he fights against him, and serves his own lusts upon
the profession of his name, and so shall fall under more eminent and remarkable
destruction. So Haeretickes who professing Christianity, and the name of
Christ, do deny him, or adulterate his truth for their own ends and lusts,
shall come under more heavy and sore damnation, which is aggravated by that
expression, Swift destruction, which shall fall upon their heads violently and
unexpectedly: for their judgment lingreth not, and their damnation slumbreth
not, verse. 3. And that it may appear that God had an eye of wrath and
vengeance upon this kind of men long ago. Its said by our Apostle here, verse.
3. their judgment now of a long time lingreth not: and by Jude, verse. 4. that
they were of old ordained to this condemnation or judgment, which new and
unusual expressions or aggravations of the destruction of this kind of men,
do give sufficient reason why haeresies are called haeresies of destruction:
whether the word damnable be restrictive to some haeresies, as implying that
there are some that are not damnable; or whether it be descriptive, as
describing what haeresies are Gerard in locum.
( in suo genere) in general, must be answered and resolved by the definition
or description of haeresie, what it is: and if we either look at that
description of it, which is implied in this Text, to be a denying of the Lord
the Redeemer, or which is given of it in any place, in the Apostolical
Epistles; we shall find, that in the Scripture acceptance and description of
haeresie, All haeresie is damnable, not that every Haeretick is certainly and
peremptorily damned: for then I see no more reason for admonishing an
haeretick, then for praying for one that has sinned a sin unto death; even
Judas called the son of perdition, had he had (as some of the Ancients say)
Peter's repentance, might have found forgiveness as he did: but there is this
mark set upon haeresie, that we may all hear and fear and do no such thing.

2. Damnable haeresies are brought in privily, words of this decomposition as
(...) do signify insinuation, these tares are sown while men sleep, in a
clancular or subtle way whereof men are not aware, as its said, Gal. 2. 4.
False brethren (...) Gal. 2. 4.
at unawares, privily crept in, and Jude 4. (...) Jude 4.
Certain men are crept in privily, meaning Haeresy-masters or false teachers.
Haeresie is modest at first, and insinuates as the Serpent into Eve by subtle
fetches and quaeres, yea, has God said? Genesis 3. 1. or by sweet promises and
inducements, ye shall not surely dye, ye shall be as Gods, your eyes shall be
opened, verse. 4. 5. So its said, verse. 3. they shall make merchandise of you.
(...) with fine forms of speech, words composed for the nonce. The Apostle
observes that there is a subtilty, or as you might say a mystery in this Trade
of corrupting men's minds from the simplicity that is in Christ, 2 Cor. 11. 2.
Ephesians. 4. 14. And sometimes they work by the wife (as the Serpent did) to give
her husband the apple: they draw men as Juglers do a pieoe of money with a fine
invisible hair, and never bring forth the portenta of their opinions, until
their sigmenta have made the way: they mix their dross among good silver, and
lap up error in the pap of truth, that some parts of the monster may have
their true shape.

3. These that bring in these damnable haeresies do even deny the Lord that
bought them, and here I might take in hand two sorts of opinions. The first is
that of the Socinians, who deny that Christ by a proper satisfaction made to
the justice of God, did buy or purchaseus. To these the singer of the Text
seems directly to point: for they not only deny the Lord Christ's theanthropie?
but his redemption by way of purchase. The other is that of Lutherani, alijque.
some that hence infer an universal redemption, because that these that
bring upon themselves swift destruction are said to be bought by f Christ: of
both which points I cannot say a little without speaking much, and therefore
shall hold me to my subject in hand; we may partly perceive by this expression
what damnable haeresies are: for its said that they who bring them in, do even
deny the Lord that bought them; If they deny Christ the Sovereign Lord See
Jude, v. 4.
((...)) by everting his person or natures. If they deny his redemption and so
evert his office (whether his Lordship or his redemption be denied) the
haeresie is damnable, and the word denying seems to me to imply, that the
proper naure of haeresie is to be Spalato, ostensio errorum Suaresij cap. 1.
euersive and overthrowting: It consists not properly in additions to the word,
saving so far as those additions are overthrowing the pillars and foundations
of truth; that is, Christ the Lord that bought us, or the like to it: for if
hay and stubble be built on this foundation, 1 Cor. 3. 12. because they do not
overthrow it, or shake and shiver it, therefore though they be errors yet they
are not haeresie. Non omnis error est haeresis (says Ad quod vult deum in
praefat. August.
Austin) every Error is not haeresic: and therefore i some distinguish of
doctrines Weems. Treatise of the 4 de generate sons. page 180.
or errors thus: some are praeter, some are circa, some are contra
fundamentum, that is (as Austine says) some touch not, some shake, and some
raze the foundation. The weight and valor of doctrines must be reckoned by
their proximity or nearenesse to the fundamentals: for it is in the
Consanguinity of doctrine (as Tertullian calls it) as it is in kindred, the
neerenesse of kindred is to be measured by neernesse to the stock.

This denial of the Lord that bought them, may be either expressly conceptis
verbis and so with a little more height of expression may amount to blasphemy,
but happily these in the text who used composed words were not so black
mouthed, or this denial may be interpretative and by consequence: and the
consequence is either from their doctrines or a consequence of fact also, from
their course or conversation.

The consequence from their doctrines (if it overthrow the faith) must not be
drawn out into a long chain and far fetched, least by that means every error
be made haeresy, but the consequence must be near and close, so that you may
be able to say this or that doctrine or opinion at the next remove or at a very
near distance denies the only sovereign God and our Lord Jesus Christ. Jude
4. the battery may strike off a tile or make a hole in the wall, but except it
be near, will not overthrow the foundation, for as from every branch of a
great tree one may go or move to the root, yet the cutting off of any twigge
or branch is not a cutting down or rooting up the tree, so though all branches
of truth have continuity with the fundamentalls or principles, yet the denial
of every truth is not a razing or overthrow of them, I instance in the great
principle, Christ Jesus is the Lord that has bought us, not because there are
not other which being denied, faith is overthrown, but because it is the
instance in my text, and in Jude. 4. and also because principles lie so close
together, and are so concenterate that an error which routs one, routes
another by immediate consequence. I will give one instance or two, Suppose the
resurrection future be denied, this overthrowes the faith, 2 Timothy 2. 18. and
see how the consequence immediately shatters all principles, 1 Cor. 15. 13. If
there be no resurrection of the dead, Then is Christ not risen, Then is our
preaching vain, Then is faith vain, Then believers are yet in their sins.
Then the dead in Christ are perished, verse. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Or suppose the
Law be brought into equipage with Christ for justification, mark the
consequence. If so (says the Apostle) then Christ shall profit you nothing,
Gal. 5. 2. Christ is become of none effect unto you, verse 4. Ye are fallen
from grace, and I make no doubt to say that those of the Galatians, who for
their carnal ends, Chap. 6. 12, 13. did break the continuity and communion of
the Church, by giving themselves up to this opinion, were haereticks, not while
it was an opinion in debate or controversy: but when it grew into a ripe
Impostume in such as adhaered to it: and do but observe in both the instances
given, by how immediate consequence the denial of the resurrection, or the
contemperament of the Law with Christ, do overthrow the fundamental of
Fundamentalls, Christ Jesus, in respect of his redemption or office.

For that which I call consequence of fact, from the course or conversation of
Haeretickes: I observe that both the Apostle in this Chapter, and Jude in his
Epistle, who follows the same thread in his description of them, do characterise
them by the Iusts and fleshy courses wherein they live. Jude speaks of false
teachers, as is evident by that he exhorts Christians to contend for the faith:
because certain men were crept in privily or unawares, verse. 3. 4 He
exemplifies the destruction of these by the same* examples of the Angels that
fell, and of Sodom and Gomorrha. He draws out their picture in the like foul
colors: and in the fourth verse calls them ungodly men, turning the grace of
God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus
Christ. And though lusts of the flesh, as adultery and the like, cannot be
called haeresie; (...) de E^cl. lib. 4. part 2. cap. 1. Morton in 1 Cor. 11. 18.
yet if a man professing Christ shall choose such an opinion or doctrine as does
patronize and maintain those lusts, and so walks in a course of sin under
the protection of such an opinion or tenet, as is contrary both to faith and
holiness, that comes up to the Scripture-description of haeresie: for so these
false teachers that bring in damnable haeresies, are said to allure through
lusts of the flesh and much wantonness, ver. 18. and to promise liberty, as
likewise those that are entangled in their errors do turn from the holy
Commandment, and turn to their former vomit and wallowing in the mire, verse.
20. 21, 22. and so the shipwreck of faith and the putting away of good
conscience, 1 Timothy 1. 19. go both together; and therefore the Nicolaitans,
whose doctrine was hateful to Christ, Rev. 2. 15. and whose lusts and
filthiness maintained by their pernicious doctrine Iren. lib. 1. cap. 20.
Clem. Alex. lib. 7. Strom.
were monstrous, can be accounted no other then damnable Haereticks (and we
may judge the like of others of the same stamp) being the very persons (as is
Epiphan. haeres. 26. Beza in Revel. 2. 15. Quiros in Judam.
conceived by good Authors) whom both Peter and Jude describe as turning the
grace of God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God and our Lord
Jesus Christ, Jude 4.

So much for the opening of the three points, which you may if you please bind
up together into one, That false teachers shall privily bring in damnable
haeresies, even denying the Lord that bought them.

Now we come to search out what Haeresie is.

The word haeresie is of Greek original, and is often translated Sect, not
Justinian in 21 et. 2.
a secando from cutting, but a sectando from following, as being a way which
men choose to follow as its said. The way which they call haeresie, Acts 24. 14
A way of worship or doctrine, for so he says, so do I worship the God of my
Fathers, believing, etc. It appears to be an act of the will electively
pitching upon such a way. For the word it self signifies election, coming not
from Martinius lexicon.
(...) to expugne or lay waste, (though that be proper enough) but from (...)
to choose or adhere unto: and therefore the Septuagint Levit. 22. 18. 21.
translate (...) free will offering by (...) election or free-willednesse. The
Rabbis call an Haeretick Drusius de 3. sectis Judae, lib. 1 cap. 2. Grotius in
Tit. 3. 10. Nic. Fuller Miscellan.
(...) which in Genesis 1. 12. Levit. 11. 22.
Scripture signifies a kind or species, and so they denote a man to be an
Haereticke, who leaving the common road or way of faith and Doctrine, sets up
and follows a particular way of his own, Elias in Tishbite.
(...) one that is (...) or (...) without law, that will not be bound up by
the rule, but runs out into his own way, and Nic. Fuller miscel. sacra. lib.
2. cap. 3.
some derive it from (...) which is translated (...) Nehem. 9. 17. Exodus 22.
16. signifying to refuse or deny, as if you would say a renegado or denyer of
the truth.

This word (...) while it kept it self among Philosophers, Physicians, and
other Professors of knowledge and learning past, for an honest word, but when
it came into the Churches quarters, and was taken up by Christians, it became
branded, stigmatized and odious. Its used about six times in the Acts 5. 17.
26. 5. 15. 5. 28. 22 24. 14. 24. 5.
Acts of the Apostles, and whether it may not in some of those places at least,
be taken in good part or indifferently, shall not be my dispute at this time.
But when you find it in the Epistles Apostolical, and in the Gospel
Churches, it has not a jot of good savor in it, but carries a mark of
iniquity and infamy upon it: In those Epistles it is used about 1 Cor. 11. 18.

four times expressly, and because I would not make a definition which you
might say is mine own, and so slight it, I will lay before you the Scriptures
that speak of it, that you may in their light see what it is.

The first place is that 1 Cor. 11. 18, 19. I hear that there be Schisms
among you, and I partly believe it. For there must be also haeresies among
you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.

The Greek Interpreters take Schism and Haeresie in this place, for both one
in a manner, and understand not by the word Haeresie any matter (...) Chr^^^
and Oecumen in ^^cum.
dogmaticall or of Doctrine: but others Beza in loc.
argue from the word (...) also. (There must also be haeresies) that they are
distinct, and that though haeresie include schism, yet schism does not
include haeresie: and to me it seems that they are near a kin, because the
Apostle rises from one to the other, saying, there are schisms, there must
also be haeresies: but they are not collaterally a kin; for by the ascent,
haeresie seems to be the greater: For there must be also haeresies, into which
those that are (...) do not Neque enim eos probatos intelligi jubet qui in
haeresin fidem demutant Tertull. de prascript.
easily fall, but are made the more conspicuous or manifest for soundness and
integrity.

That we may find the true nature of haeresie, let me in few words declare what
schism is.

The word schism imports a rent or division of things that were or should be
in continuity and undevidednesse, and as its taken in the matter of Religion,
it signifies a rupture in the communion, or from the communion of the Church
upon unnecessary and unwarrantable causes and grounds. A causeless breaking,
or breaking off from the communion of the Church in matter of worship or
Religion. Society and communion are of great importance: the evil of schism
is answerable to the good of society and communion; we are to judge of schism
by the cause of it: For if it be upon a cause which the Word warrants not, it
is a sin of high nature; Cameron de Schismat.
Some distribute it into two sorts or parts, b negative and positive. Negative
is the very rupture and breaking off: positive is the coalition of the parts
rent off into new bodies, or associations under other Pastors and Teachers. The
formality of schism consists in the secession or negative part, though the
coalition into new bodies, which was called the setting up, altar contra
altar may make it more obstinate and pernicious; Now I say the cause must rule
us in judging of it. For as it is not the party which separates that makes the
Divorce, but the Adulterous party which gives the cause. And as ( Mornay says)
it is not the man who commences or begins the suite which makes the trouble,
but he that detains the right: So they are the schismatics who give the just
cause of separation from them, what a hurry was made in the Church by the
paschal controversy; wherein ( Tract of schis. page 5.
as one says) both parties might beschismaticks, dividing themselves asunder
upon so trivial a matter, who were the Schismatics when the second Council of
Nice set up Images into such honor, and thereby put the Churches into
combustion? Doubtless the Council was the Schismaticke? who were the
Schismatics when the reformed Churches after all means used, were either driven
out, or broke off from the communion of the Church of Rome? questionless the
Mornay of the Church. cap. 10.
Pope and his followers, not the Protestants, who departed from them, as the
Romans had a saying, that when the Gauls had taken Rome, and Camillus, with the
rest of the Patriots were at Veij, then, though the walls of Rome stood where
they did before, yet Rome was not in Rome but at Veij; I shall not meddle with
those Episcopal dissentions in the ancient Churches, commonly called schisms,
nor those about the Popedom Spalato lib. 4. de rep. eccles. cap. 11.
thirty in number, as they are reckoned: Schism simply and nakedly is a
breaking off, or breaking off from the communion of the Church, upon such
grounds as have no weight in the word of God to allow them, as namely when
Schisma ni fallor est eadem opinantem atque eodem ritu colentem quo caeteri,
solo congregationis delectari dissidio. Aug. contra Faustum. lib. 20. et contra
Cresconium grammat.
the same faith or doctrine in substantialls is held, and there is accordance
and agreement in them: yet through passions and private ends or fancies, there
is offense taken at lesser matters of fact or order, and so the divorce is made
for such faults in the yoke fellow as are far short of adultery, as if the
members of any of the seven Churches should have separated, because of some
dross in those Golden Candlesticks. The Donatist who separated upon that
principle, that there was not true Church where good and bad were mixed; and
that the chafe in the floor made the wheat unclean, or that the communion
of the godly was blasted and polluted by the mixture of ungodly ones amongst
them, was in open schism: both in breaking off from the Churches of Christ
upon that reason, and in assu^eing liberty to erect new Churches, only which,
he called the true Churches of Christ.

Now for haeresy; it is schism and somewhat more as the Apostle implies, and
what is that majus quid as Tertullian calls it, or that somewhat more, the
answer is given in that generally received saying of Terome, haeresis
perversum dogma habet Haeresy goes with a perverse opinion, or error in
doctrine, which I conceive to be a very truth, (though Grotius in 1 Cor. 11.
Grotius affirm that ex vi vocis it be nihil aliud quam schisma) because the
word haeresy in all authors, from the first use of it has signified a sentence
or dogmaticall tenet or assertion, as the several Sects of Philosophers who
differd in their opinions are i Jamblichus. lib. 2. cap. 1.
called haeresies and therefore e Jamblichus having written of the life of
Pythagoras, now says he it remains that I speak (...) concerning his tenets
or opinions, so the sects of Saducees and Pharisees who differd in opinions are
called haeresies, and the Haeresin Syri vocant (...) Doctrinam Drusius in Act.
24. 5.
Syriake calls haeresy, doctrine, in which sense it must be taken. Acts. 28.
22. this haeresy that is this doctrine concerning Christ is every where spoken
against or contradicted, and the Apostles Peter and Jude are express, that
these haeresies are brought in by false teachers, and are opposite to the
faith, denying Christ Jesus the Lord and his redemdtion. 2. Pet. 2. 1. Jude. 3.
4. upon all which considerations, and that (as Tertullian elegantly says)
haeresy is a degenerate thing, which arises from the corruption and
adulterating of the truth ( tanquam caprificus a papauere fici, oleaster, ex
olivae grano etc) I am clear enough that in haeresy there must be matter of
opinion or doctrine, and so the meaning of the Apostle in this place of the
Corinthians is to show, that as there were already schisms amongst them, and
dividing into parties as their partiality, affection, and selfe-respects led
them, so, there must be also haeresies or errors in doctrine which should
fight against the truth of the Gospel, and patronize vicious, and filthy lusts
of the flesh, to which both errors, and lusts there would be some that would
decline, but those that were approved and sound-hearted would be made manifest
among them, and so I conclude that haeresy is a renting or tearing the
communion of the Church, as it is schism, and a subverting of the doctrine of
truth and holiness as it is haeresy, like sedition in the common wealth, (for
schism as one says is an ecclesiastical sedition) when it is not only made
against the faults of some persons, or their miscarriage in government, or some
abuses in fact, but arises from principles or errors opposite and destructive
to the fundamental laws and justice of the Kingdom.

The second place is that Gal. 5. 19. 20. The works of the flesh are manifest
which are adultery fornication. etc. Seditions, heresies, (...) translated
divisions. Romans 16. 17. is here translated seditions, seditions or divisions
and haeresies may well be set together for they go together, haeresies are
works of the flesh, manifest works of the flesh, The works of the flesh are
said to be manifest, either because they are the product and fruits of that
inward corruption called flesh, and are the tokens and marks of a carnal man,
or because they may be discerned and known by the Mr. Perkin^ in Galath 5.
light of reason and of a natural conscience, except the light be by strength
of lusts extinct, or by the judgment of God darkened or put out. Divines
usually from this place do prove against the Papists, that by flesh is not
only meant the sensual appetite or inferior faculties of the Soul, but the
higher also, as the mind and judgment, because haeresy is an error of the
mind and so no doubt it is, though it may be called carnal also in respect of
those fleshly lusts or ends which carry men thereinto, and are exercised under
the patronage thereof. Austin sometime says that in his judgment, it either
not at all, or very hardly can be regularly defined Aut non omnino aut
difficulter etc. Aug. ad quod vult deum in proefatione.
what makes an haeretick, but he comes very near it in another place saying
he is an haeretick (in my opinion) who for some or other temporal profit
especially his own glory or dignity, does either beget De^ vi^^^^a^e ^redendi
cap. ^. ^ui (...) commodi and maxim ^ ^^ri^^ principatusque sui gratia. etc.
or follow false and new opinions. The Scripture notion of the word haeresy
runs very much this way, and it is to be feared that men's self ends, wealth,
eminency interests have too much ingrediency into their opinions in these
times, the Lord will discover and blast the doctrine which he hates, and them
also that hold up such opinions, as are under his (...) and happily against the
conscience also, of those that follow them, for their private and unworthy ends.

The third place is that Titus* ^. 10. 11. A (...) that is an haeretick after
the first and second ad^^^i^^on reject. Knowing that ^e that is such, i^

is an exhortation to avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions

it follows. A man that is a haeretick. etc. whence the Examen censurae. page
272. and 280.
Arminians interpret an haeretick to be one that makes contention and division
upon trifling and slighty questions, who is condemned of himself because he
litigates and makes a stir about such things as himself knows to be of
small importance, but I conceive the matter not to be so slighty as they would
make it, for it is said of such a one (...) he is subverted, as a Ship that
turns up her keele or a house when the foundation is turned topsy turvy, and
therefore Deuteronomy. 32. 20. where the extremely desperate estate of a people at

(...) it is a people turned upside down or subverted, which also the (...)

Hebrew word imports both in this place and else where, and so haeresy is
concluded to be a subversive thing and not a peevish litigation about slight
questions, as the Arminians would put it off, but thus much may be collected
from the cohaerence, that a man may be denominated an haeretick for doctrinall
and dogmaticall errors holden and contentiously defended and maintained, and

word in the text signifies, one that with complacency and choice adheres to
such errors, but the greatest doubt is what is meant by those words, he
sins being condemned of himself, which Chrisost. in Titus. 3. 10. 11.
Chrysostom refers to the admonitions precedent, for in that such a man has
been admonisht, he cannot reply in his own defense (...) etc. no man has

many disallowd and argued against, that moderate and sweet breathed De
Arrianis. lib. 5.
Salvian speakeing of the Arrians says, Haeretici sunt, non scientes, apud nos
non apud se, quod illi nobis, hoc nos illis etc. They are Haereticks but not
knowingly, with us they are, but not with themselves, And indeed the word in
the text does not necessarily carry so far, as that an haeretick is condemned
of his own conscience, but as (...) is a man taught of himself, without a
Master, so (...) is a man condemned of himself, not merely misled by others to
whom he has given up himself blindfold, but as one that has electively taken
up and with a fixed self-will is resolved to persist, in his error and way,
which he thinks to be truth, and that he does Godgood service in holding on in
it, there are two things that may be clearly taken up. 1. That it is made the
character of an haeretick to sin because condemned of himself. 2. That another
man may know that he is subverted and sins being self condemned, for 'its said
after admonition reject him Knowing that he that is such is subverted. etc. But
how shall this be known? Is it because he sins against common notions or
principles within the ken of natures light? This restraines haeresy which is a
subverting of the faith only to that which is contrary to light of nature,
which light of nature may be in some particular so defaced, like a
superscription on old coin, that though I may know he sins, yet he is not
convinced in himself. Is it then because he takes an opinion for his lusts
sake and private ends against his light and knowledge? Then indeed he sins
because condemned of himself, but how can another know it? It rests therefore
that an haeretick rejecting admonition may be said to be condemned of himself,
because he chooses his own errors, and rejects the truth and so
interpretative that is vertually and by consequence is condemned of himself,
as they who thrust away the word from them, did judge themselves unworthy of
eternal life. Acts. 13. 46. Here is (as you see) an (...) or self condemning
without conviction of conscience or knowledge of their own sin in it.

The fourth place is the Text which we have in hand, and this whole chapter,
compared with the Epistle of Jude, in both which haeresy is graphically
described, as has before been opend. That which remains to be done, is the
drawing up of that has been said concerning the meaning of the word, or the
explication of the things, out of the Scriptures alleged, into a result, and
that is this. The Scripture seems to make haeresy a complicate evil in which
there is these three things (whether all of them essential ingredients, or
some of them be usual attendants or concomitants I dispute not)

1. Dogmaticall or doctrinall error, even over throwing the faith or (...) 2.
Tim. 2. 18. Funditas ever. tunt, solo equa^t.
subverting the pillars and foundations of the doctrine of Christ which Jude
calls the common salvation ver. 3. 2. Separation from, or renting of the unity
and communion of the Church, some time Schisina eructat in here. sin ut non
nemo ait.
schism introduces haeresy, when men are run out upon peevishness of spirit
or some unwarrantable grounds, they commonly run on into error of opinion and
doctrine, being caught like a loose and wandering sheep, severd from the flock
by the wolves which lie in wait for such, sometimes the schism follows upon
the error of opinion drunk in, and so departure from the truth, is attended
with departure from the society and communion of the Church Jude having
described haerenicks, says ver. 19. (...) these are they that separate
themselves. 3. A loose and carnal course taken up and followed either
privately or openly, and that under the patronage and protection of these
dogmaticall errors, Their lives are as full of Athisme as their opinions of
blasphemy or false-hand, all which being laid together, it appears that an
haereticke's understanding and mind is corrupted, a good conscience is thrust
away, his will electively adheres to error and false ways; his affections are
drowned in sensuality and lusts, he is subverted and sins being self
condemned, either (...). Oicumen in tit. 3. 8.
formerlly, by his own conscience and light yet remaining, or Ideo sibi
damnatus quia in quo damnatur sibi eligit Tertull, de proe
virtually by his voluntary rejection of Gods truth to stick to his own
error, and so in conclusion (except the Lord pull him out of the fire by some
happy hand in the mean time) he brings upon himself swift destruction. As
touching pertinacy or obstinacy which is generally by Divines put into the
definition of haeresie according to that saying: errare possum, haereticus esse
nolo, I shall say but this, that obstinacy may be considered, either in
respect of the crime of haeresie, or of the censure and rejection of an
Haereticke.

In respect of the crime of haeresie two ways. First, that an error in it
self not haeresie is made haeresie, by obstinacy, as some of the Papists will
have that to be haeresie which is stiffly holden by any man after the Rhemists
Annot. in Tit. 3. 10.
determination or admonition of the Church, when a Council, or that
transcendent thing called the Pope has defined by the authority of his
infallible Chair, that such an error is haeresie, and has put it under
Anathema, though Error in side non ideo haeresis quia ab ecclesia damnatus sed
quia fidei contrarius. Altenstaig, etc. verbo, haeresis and Turre crem, summa,
lib. 4. ^ part. cap. 3.
others of them (in my opinion) say more rightly, that an error in faith is
not therefore haeresie, because condemned by the Church: but because contrary
to the faith: or secondly, that an error subverting the faith is not haeresie,
unless attended with obstinacy, and that (as I conceive) cannot be said; for
as Constancy in that which is good, as namely faith or justice, does not make
faith to be faith, or justice to be justice: so neither does obstinacy in
evil, or error, make that error to be haeresie; but as virtue is
commendable, and rendered more glorious by constancy, so is haeresie aggravated
and made more high by obstinacy. The essence or nature, and so the denomination
of haeresie is not to be measured by obstinacy against the decision or
admonition of the Church, (for then every such obstinate error should be
haeresie) but by the contrariety and opposition of it to the principles of
faith which are razed or overthrown.

In respect of the censure and rejection of an Haeretick, (which rejection,
whether it be by a private believer or by sentence of the Church I now dispute
not) I suppose obstinacy is requisite: for as in other scandalls the rule of
proceeding is. If he hear not thee, or if he hear not the Church: so its
said, a man that is an Haereticke, reject, after the first and second
admonition; Contumacy is a common adjunct of sin, in order to the final
judgment or sentence of the Church in excommunication; In a word, I cannot
read those words, Titus 3. 10. Thus, or in this sense. (...)
A man that after the first and second admonition is an Haereticke, as if he
then became an Haereticke by standing out against or after admonition, but
thus, reject a man haereticall; after the first and second admonition, which
argues and demonstrates, that he may be an Haeretick before he be obstinate,
and so obstinacy is not essential to the nature or being of haeresie, Though I
confess, (and do suggest it to your observation and saddest thoughts) that
Haeretickes are generally and usually stricken with obstinacy, few of them that
run into this labyrinth do either seek, or find the way out; when the
vital parts of faith are putrified and corrupted in any Patient, the recovery
is hopeless; weigh seriously that expression or mark set on these very men by
Jude, ver. 12. Trees twice dead, plucked up by the roots; when do you see such
a tree recover life and fruit? Its a hard rescue to fetch a man off that is
prisoner to an erring conscience, especially if he be fettered by both legs,
his judgment being captivated by error, and his affections enslaved by lusts;
we must do our duty, and of some have compassion, and others of them save with
fear: (...) snatching them out of the fire. Jude, verse 22. 23. Though they
complain of violence offered to their liberty, when they are pulled out of the
fire. For (as (...) qui servat idem facit ^^cidenti Horat.
the saying is) he that saves a man against his will, has no more thanks for
his labor then if he killed him. It is a matter of wonder and amazement to see
men of eminent parts and learning, of great reputation for Religion,
captivated, carried away, and made prey of, by senseless and absurd fancies
and opinions: but that we know there are no delusions or lies, but are strong
when God delivers a man up to them in way of punishment for not receiving the
truth with love thereof. The Lord give us to receive his truth with fear and
trembling, and make us thankful (whom in this time of wantonness (as some
call it) or rather wickedness of opinions, he has kept from shipwreck of
faith, and made to stand upright when men that have lived strictly and
religiously (as (...) Chrysostom. Epistola 4. ad Olymp.
Chrysostom said of Pelagius) seem to warp and to be drawn awry.

Having thus far laid open the nature and danger of haeresie by the
Scriptures, I should now come to the use of all: but that in few words I desire
to put you in mind in what notion the word haeresie has passed amongst men in
common acceptance, and that I shall do in these two words.

1. The Ecclesiastical or Scholasticall acceptance is this: T^rre^rem. sum.
lib. 4.
Haeresie is an error or assertion contrary to the faith in points
fundamental or momentous, holden or maintained by a man professing the
Christian faith: this they call simple haeresie, and such a one an Haereticke:
licet ab ecclesia non recesserit, though (says In Gal. cap. 5.
Jerome) he does not separate or make secession from the Church: and though
he cannot be blemished with wickedness moral, or in conversation. All
momentous truths are not strictly so called fundamental; there are truths (as
I may say) of second and third magnitude; like stones in a building which be
next unto, or upon the foundation; what these are which are precisely
fundamental, and what is the boundary of them, and by what certain measure
they must be measured, if it exceed not my skill to determine (as I dare not
say but it may) yet it is a work beyond my time. This only I say to the point
in hand, That the formalis ratio or nature of haeresie as it is distinguished
from schism and fleshly lusts, is rightly stated to consist in an error or
assertion, contrary to, and destructive of the faith, and the degree of pravity
in the error, is correspondent to the degree of impor tance of the truth
that is destroyed by it ordenied.

2. The vulgar, and indeed abusive acceptance of the word, is an infamy or
reproach which usually men flinge in the face of others at random, that are not
of their opinion: and its too true (as a learned man says) that haeresie and
schism are two theological scare-crowes, many times set up to scare people
and affright them. The strongest party of the two commonly cries out of
haeresie: the weakest party cry out of persecution, so the Papist puts a mark
or brand of haereticall pravity upon, and calls all Haeretickes, who are
opposite to their Spalato. lib. 1 cap 10.
false doctrines or filthy lusts; Haeresie was taken in a large sense, when the
L. Cook his Institutes.
Lollards were indicted for haeresie, because they held it not meritorious to
go in pilgrimage to Saint Thomas, or Mary of Walsingham: or when Virgilius
Bishop of Saltzburg was condemned for the haeresie of holding that there were
Antipodes; Apology, cap. 7.
Bellarmine tells K. James that for all his believing the Scriptures, the three
Creeds, the four great and general Counsels, yet he might be an Haereticke:
and his meaning was, because the Popes infallibility or supremacy was not in
any of the Kings Creeds. As the intolerable abuse of excommunication formerly,
made no man to value it above the price at which he could buy it off; so the
abuse of this name, and throwing it about at random, makes it not regarded,
which yet is a fearful thing in it self, and bringing swift destruction; It
has been stretched too far to be a brand stigmatizing true believers, and to
scare men from prying into the truth by making it odious, and it is shriveled
and shrunk up too much, even almost to nothing by such as are afraid to hit
themselves by defining it: but is there not such a thing? is there not such a
damnable sin? why then do such horrible sins as the sin against the holy
Ghost, and the sin of haeresie, lie like a terra incognita undiscovered,
unpreacht against? Seeing there is to be found in Scripture, especially in the
Apostolical Epistles, so much said in description of, and for caution against
damnable haeresies and doctrines, and the false teachers which privily bring
them in, and bring upon themselves and many that follow their pernicious ways,
such fearful destruction.

That which now remains is to draw up that which has been said into matter of
use and application.

And first let me speak to you all, who professethe Protestants once again, by
declaring your selves against the heterodoxies and dangerous errors of the
present times, for the infection spreads by reason of many that go abroad with
running sores upon them; and if the Apostle, when he gave all diligence to
write to believers of the common salvation, thought it needful for him to
write to them, and exhort them that they should earnestly contend for the
faithonce delivered to the Saints, upon this ground and reason that there were
certain men crept in unawares, etc. Jude 3. 4. You cannot think it impertinent
and unseasonable at this time to be exhorted to the same earnest contending for
the faith, for you are beset with danger on all sides, the contagion is
epidemicall, many are distracted with here is Christ, and there is Christ, and
are misled into pernicious ways: yea even some that seemed to be good ears
of come are mil-dewd and almost blasted, I do therefore exhort you to consider
the danger, as you may easily sum it up from that which has been said, for
you have heardi that there shall be false Teachers amongst you, weneed not say
there, shall be, but more suitable to our own condition we may say, There are
as its said, 1 John 4. 4. many false Prophets are gone out into the world; you
see they are gone out, I would we might see that they were come in again. 2.
That these are they who bring in damnable haeresies, they go out to bring
these in, they are ringleaders, or (as Tertullian said of Philosophers) the
patriarchs of haeresies. 3. That they bring in these damnable haeresies
privily, they spawn first in quaeries or plausible beginnings (the greatest
Crocodile did at first lie in an egg Franzius historia animali um.
Paulo majus anserino, little bigger then a goose-egge) 2 Cor. 11. 15.
themselves are transformed as Ministers of righteousness: 2 Pet. 2. 3. Romans
16. 18.
their words are composed and good, their speeches are fair, their artifice is
Ephesians. 4. 14.
full of slight and cunning craftiness, and therefore they creep at unawares
not only into houses, but into men's bosoms also. 4. That haeresies are
damnable and destructive poison, though given in honey, they arise and are made
up coede Scripturarum (as Tertullian says) by felling down the goodly timber
of the holy Scriptures; 2 Pet. 3. 16.
wrested to the destruction of them that wrest them; they turn grace into
lasciviousness; deny the Lord Jesus Christ, overthrow the faith, subvert the
soul, carry men down the stream of lust and liberty, and so bring swift
destruction. 5. That many shall follow these pernicious ways, Romans 16. 18.
the simple are deceived, the learned are given up to 2 These 2. 12.
strong delusions, the unstable are carried about like children with every Ephesians.
4. 14.
wind of doctrine: Those that by profession of the truth had escaped the
pollutions of the world, are again 2 Pet. 2. 20.
entangled and overcome, and so the latter end of many (that are carried away
either by speciousnesse of error or liberty of lust) is worse then the
beginning. 6. That the last times shall be most of all infested with these
pernicious errors. 1 Timothy 4. 1.
The spirit 1 Jude 17. 18.
speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith,
giving heed to seducing spirits: the Apostles have foretold that there shall
be mockers in the last time: and by this (says 1 John 2. 18.
the Apostle) we know that it is the last time because there are many
Antichrists, and we may very well understand by the last times, not only the
times of the Gospel in general, but the time of Antichrists declining as well
as of his arising and growth. The last of the last times: For as the last times
of the Jewish Church (after it had shaken off the captivity and idolatry) were
pestered and infested most of all with haeresies until Christ came with a new
doctrine of the Gospel, and until the desolution of the frame of that Church:
so the last days of Gospel Churches having shaken off the second Babylonish
captivity and idolatry, shall be infested with these dangerous errors and
haeresies, and happily until the very second coming of Christ, or at least
until he shall gloriously declare himself in the destruction of the beast and
false Prophet and in the calling of the Jews.

These things being laid together do cry aloud unto you, to consider your
danger, and to hearken to the frequent inculcations of the Apostles in their
Epistles, in almost all their 2 Cor. 11. 3.
Epistles, describing false teachers to be like the Serpent that beguiled Eve,
branding them with the name of Jannes and Jambres, Balaam, false Apostles,
deceitful workers, ministers of Satan, etc. stigmatizing their doctrins with
the names of damnable haeresies, doctrines of Devils, etc. Fortifying
Christians with effectual arguments and exhortations against the impressions
and infections of such poisonous errors. And if you look upon those Epistles
which were sent from heaven to the seven Churches, you shall find that the
greatest part of those comminations in them contained, are thundered forth
against haeresies or doctrinall errors, maintaining or cherishing (as I may
call them) haereticall lusts, there we find them Revel. 2. 2.
that said they were Apostles, but were liars, the cap. 2. 9. 14. 15. 20. 24.
blasphemy of such as said they were Jews, but were the Synagogue of Satan, the
doctrine of Balaam, the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, the teaching and seducing
of Jezebel, the depths of Satan, etc. The Churches are commended, or the
Angels of those Churches, who found out these disguised seducers, and kept the
truth uninfected by them, and those Angels or Churches blamed which Revel. 2.

had them Verse. 20.
and suffered them in their bosom. These things I offer to your serious and
sad consideration, you have not made use of the point, as soon as you have
said The Minister railes. Its not my meaning to pour out all this that has
been said upon every error either preached or followed in our times: but to
show you that false teachers and haeresies must be and shall be in the Gospel
Churches: and to put you in mind what the Scripture says concerning them, and
how much you are concerned to look about you: for I observe that men are not
so jealous over themselves, or so afraid of e corruption of their minds as
they ought to be, nor so sensible of sin in intellectual errors as in moral
corruptions, and yet we know diseases in the head are mortal too: and that a
fish begins to corrupt and stink in the head and so throughout; corrupt manners
usually and naturally follow upon corrupt minds; they that are not sound in the
faith, no wonder if they be not sound in the fear, and in the ways of God,
whither will this new scepticisme come and into what will it be resolved? but
into Athiesme, when men begin to fall; we see by experience, that many fall
from story to story till they come to the very bottom, And therefore I exhort
and beseech you all to that which the scripture exhorts and in joins upon
Christians, who are in danger of being seduced by false teachers or their
doctrines, and that is, to try the spirits whether they are of God. 1. John. 4.
1. To contend for the faith once delivered Jude. 3. To beware lest you be
carried away with the error of lawless men 2. Pet. 3. 17. To turn away from
such as creep into houses and lead captive silly women, 2. Tim. 3. 5. 6. To
avoid foolish questions which are unprofitable and vain Titus. 3. 9. To hold
faith and a good conscience. 1. Tim. 1. 19. To continue in the things that you
have learned and been assured of out of the word of God, 2. Tim. 3. 14. And
lastly If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine receive him not
into your house neither say to him (...) 2. Epistle. of John. 10. 11. For he
that bids him god speed is partaker of his evil deeds, where the Apostle
supposes that false teachers are men of evil deeds, besides their false
doctrines, or that indeed their false doctrine is evil deeds in the plural
number, and therefore not to be slighted off as a thing of the mind or mental
mistake only, you see that to countenance or encourage such teachers is to be
partaker of their evil deeds, and whatsoever credit you will give to the
report of lib. 3. cap. 3.
Irenaeus concerning John his leaping out of the bath from Cerinthus or
Polycarp his refuseal of Marcion his acquaintance, yet, the observation which
he makes uponthose reports or histories, is to be taken notice of that the
Apostles and their followers, would Tantum Apostoli and eorum discipu^i etc.
Iren lib. 3. cap. 3.
not so much as verbo tenus communicate with any of them that had adulterated
the truth, how much less should private Christians close with such seducers
who are more likely to pull them into the water, then they to pull them out,
Naturally we are tinder too apt to take fire by their sparks, he that fishes
with an haereticall bait may happily catch more in a month, than some godly
Minister shall bring to Christ with all his travel and pains, as long as he
lives, for he has the advantage of the bait and therein lies the odds of
success between preaching of error and preaching of the truth, I marvel
(says the Apostle) that you are so soon removed from him, that called you
into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel. Gal. 1. 6. there was the wonder
(...) that they were removed so quickly, and the Apostles wonder may be ours
also, we have been a people of as powerful godliness, as any in the world;
practical divinity was improved to a great height of clearenesse and
sweetness but I fear that I may truly say we were best in worst times, we
held our cloak in the wind and now are laying it off in the sun, A miserable
declination from the life and power of godliness is come to pass within these
few years, our practicals, our inward and close ways of walking with God in
faith and love, are sublimed into fancies and vapor out into fumes of new
opinions, and which is worst of all, we take this dropsy to be growth, and
conceive our selves to be more spiritual and refined because more ayry and
notionall. The Lord humble us for our declensions and swervings from the 1 Timothy
6. 3.
end of the commandment (which is love out of a pure heart and of a good
conscience and of faith unfeigned) and for our turnings aside to vain
ianglings, The best way of fortification of our selves against the allurements
and assaults of false teachers is 1. To be grounded in the principles of the
doctrines of Christ, or else we shall easily be tumbled up and down like loose
stones that lie not fast in the building upon the foundation. 2. To study and
adhere unto the doctrine which is 1 Timothy 1. 5. 6.
according to godliness, practical and edifying truths, which draw up the
heart into acquaintance and communion with God, and draw it out in love and
obedience to him, For its good that the heart be stablisht with grace, Heb. 13.
9. 3. To hold faith and a good conscience 1. Tim. 1. 19. for if we thrust away
a good conscience by entertaining base lusts and ends, the shipwreck of faith
will follow. 4. To pray for confirmation and establishment by the hand of God,
for as it is not a strong constitution that is a protection against the plague,
so neither is it parts and learning which secure us from believing lies and
delusions. Its a mercy for which we are not enough thankful, that God keeps
any of us standing upright when others shrink awry, or that we are enabled to
discern between truth and error, and to stand for the one, and withstand the
other; when so many that have driven a great trade of profession are broken and
turned bankerupts.

5. To keep as a treasure those truths wherein you have formerly found comfort,
and which have been attested and confirmed to you by your own experience, sit
upon those flowers still and suck their fresh honey every day. A Christian
very hardly parts with those truths that have been sealed up to his experience,
but its no wonder that a man should lose that out of his head which he never
had in his heart.

To those that bring in or follow these pernicious swift destruction, you are
under judgment which slumbers not. It will be destructive to you to wrest the
Scriptures. 2. Pet. 5. 16. and to make merchandise of men's souls for sinful
ends. 2. Pet. 2. 3. To corrupt the minds of men from the simplicity that is in
Christ. 2. Cor. 11. 3. and to cause divisions and scandalls Romans 16. 17. are
things which will cost you dear, lay to heart the terrible expressions of
wrath which are fulminated against such men in Scripture, There may be
differences in opinion, between them that are godly, which are not
inconsistent, with the peace of the Churches and for which its unlawful (...)
(as the historian says) to make butter and cheese of one another, Its a
discreet rule which is laid down by one Conradas Bergius. dedictamine, etc.
Si non idem sentimus de veritate at saltem de pondere If we cannot agree upon
the truth of every question or point of divinity yet at least lets be agreed
concerning the weight and moment thereof, so as not to make as great a stir
about a tile of the house, as if it were a foundation stone, nor erect new
parties or Churches upon every lesser variation; but to contend for, or pretend
a liberty of professing or publishing such doctrins as overthrow the faith and
subvert the soul under the name of liberty of conscience can be no other then
(...) 2. Tim. 3. 9. a manifest folly or madness. Is this liberty any part of
Christ's purchase? Has he made men free to sin and deny him that bought them?
what yoke of bondage does this liberty free us from? Gal. 5. 1. should we
claim a liberty of being in bondage to error? or promise to men a liberty of
being servants to corruption, which the falseteachers in effect did 2. Pet. 2.
19. God has (as one says) reserved to himself as his prerogative three
things. Ex nihilo creare, futura praedicere, conscientijs dominari. To create
out of nothing, to foretell things to come, to have dominion over conscience,
and it is true that while a thing is within, in the conscience, its out of man's
reach, but when 'its acted and comes abroad then it comes into man's
jurisdiction and is cognizable in foro humano, God only is judge of thoughts,
men also are judges of actions, Its a great mistake and of very ill consequence
to imagine that a man is always bound to act or practice according to the
light or judgment of conscience though rightly informed in thesi, for then I
see not, that there can be any place for that rule given by the Apostle. Rom:
14. 22. Have thou faith? have it to thy self before God, Truth it self though
never to be denied yet is not always to be declared, for the hurt or scandal
may be greater, then an inseasonable profession or practice of that which is in
it self lawful may be worth, but the mistake is yet more gross to imagine
that an erring conscience is a sufficient protection or warranty for an evil
act. Its sin to go against an erring conscience, ( Stante dictamine) as its
sin to ravish and force awhore. Its sin also to act according to the dictate of
an erring conscience as to committ adul tery with consent. To make conscience
the final judge of actions, is to wipe out the hand writing of the word of
God, which does condemn many times, those things which conscience justifies,
yea and men also may pass just judgment on delusions or lies though those
that vent them do believe them for truths; If conscience be warrant enough for
practices and opinions, and liberty of conscience be a sufficient license to
vent or act them, I cannot see but the judicatories either of Church or State
may shut up their Shop, and be resolved into the judicatory of every man's
private conscience. And put the case that the Magistrate should conceive
himself bound in conscience to draw forth his authority against false
teachers, or their damnable haeresies, and (upon that supposed error) should
challenge a liberty of judging, as we do of acting, would our liberty give us
any ease so long as he had his, and were it not better for him to judge and for
us to walk by a known rule? and if we should say that his liberty of judging
is unlawful, it is as easy for him to say that our liberty of preaching or
professing errors, is so too.

To you that are Ministers of the word, that you would draw forth the sword of
the Spirit against these spirits of error, as not only the duty you owe to
Gods truth and men's souls requires, but also the pressing examples of the
Apostles do constrain you; let not the Lord Jesus Christ and his offices, be
denied by false teachers and by your silence too, and the Lord grant that it
may not be said of you as of the Ministers of Ephesus Acts. 20. 30. also of
your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away
Disciples after them. Catharinus said of some middle-region men in those times,
that they were Luther anunculi half or dough-baked Lutherans; Let us not halt
between two opinions but be valiant for the truth. He is but half a good
Shepherd that feeds the sheep in good pasture, but defends them not from the
wolves; It belongs to you (...) Titus. 1. 11. to stop their mouths that is by
conviction as is plain by the ninth verse as Christ (...) Matthew. 22. 34. Stopped
the Sadduces mouths by silencing their arguments. They will tell you that
arguments of ure seca, fire and faggot are not fit arguments for Ministers,
that their minds ought to be enlightened, not their bodies burned, and the truth
is, the keys are given to Peter not the sword, He usurps that without
authority, the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, Malchus ear is not to
be cut off by us. But will they that plead exemption from violence, suffer and
endure the word of conviction? will they afford their ears and patiently bear
the examination of their errors? I fear they will not; such is their love to
and their plerophory of error, Nay will they not rather cast dirt upon the
Ministry, and use all stratagems to undermine it, decrying their calling and
their livelihood or tithes which among all their destructive errors must
needs be confessed to be a saveing doctrine, whatsoever be the event, you that
are Gods Ministers must venture into the Lions mouth to save a sheep, and
assert and vindicate the truth of God from being taken captive by error: for
if either his truth or his people be lost by your default, the account will be
heavy.

As I began, so I shall conclude with you (the Honorable Arrius in Alexand. was
but as one spark, a little water at first would have quenched that fire which
afterward set almost all the world in flames, I see by your order for keeping
of this solemn day, that you take notice of the growth of error, haeresie and
blasphemy, I would you had taken such notice of the beginnings of them. If you
take notice of these as a judgment upon us, then search out the sin for which
this judgment comes. If you take notice of them as our sin, then let every man
labor to own it so far as by participation it is made his own, that so we
may be truly humbled, and renew our Vows and Covenants to own and stand up
for the truth of God, against all invasions of error and haeresie; you as
Magistrates, we as Ministers, all as men that have souls to be saved or lost.
Its a good rule, In eo serviunt reges deo, in quo non possunt illi servire nisi
ut reges, Kings and Princes, and indeed all magistrates do therein serve God,
wherein they cannot serve him but as Magistrates: we are exhorted to pray for
Kings and all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable
life in all godliness and honesty, 1 Timothy 2. 2.

There is (as Divines distinguish) simple haeresie and complicate.

Simple haeresie is an opinion or assertion holden and maintained contrary to,
and subversive of the faith by one that professes the Christian Religion:
Complicate haeresie is that which is attended with schism, sedition,
blasphemy, where one opinion lies with another, and begets a new bastard: a new
monster growing up into a multiformity more and more, until it break forth into
such dangerous symptoms as the forenamed.

The schismatic Haereticke upon his opinion breaks off from the communion of
the Church, and runs out into separation, setting up his new light (as he calls
it) in a new candlestick.

The blasphemous Haereticke strikes through the name of the great and glorious
God, or his truth with despightfull reproaches not to be named.

The seditious Haereticke troubles the peace of the Church and State, as an
army is troubled by Mutineers.

The seducing Haereticke panders to his bed all he can, and goes up and down
to vent his poison to the infection of others, privily bringing in damnable
haeresies.

There is a great contest about simple haeresie whether it come under your
sword or no in respect of capital punishment. The Vide 18. argumenta
Lutheranorum apud Conradum. Bergium de haeresi.
Lutherans are negative and so are very many others, Haereticidium ob simplicem
aut nudam haeresin nemo nostrum simpliciter asseruit. None of us (say they)
Censura in cap. 24.
have asserted haereticide or capital punishment for simple haeresie. And
Calvin in opusc. de Serveto.
Calvin says of Servetus, vel sola modestia potuisset vitam redimere, that he
might have saved his life had he been but modest. And to such I wish light and
not fire, let bloody Papists only have this brand of cruelty upon them to
confute errors by fire and faggot.

For the blasphemous and seditious Haeretickes, both Haereticum sedittosum and
blasphemum capitali supplicio dignum nemo ex nostris facile impugnabit. Tota
quaestio est de haeretico simplici. Meisnerus Philos. sob sect 2 cap. 4.
Lutherans and others of the Reformed churches do agree that they may be
punished capitally, that is for their blasphemy or sedition; but the
Schlichtingius pro Secino contra Meisneru^ page 457.
Socinian stands out herealso, and denies it; alleging that the punishment of
false Prophets in the old Testament was speciali jure by special law granted
to the Israelites, and therefore you must not look (says the Socinian) into
the old Testament for a rule of proceeding against false Prophets and
blasphemers: Nor (says Calvin de Serveto in opusc. Catharinus in 3 Titus 10.
Calvin and Catharinus) can you find in the new Testament any precept for the
punishment of Thieves, Traitors, Adulterers, Witches, murderers and the like,
and yet they may, or at least some of them be capitally punished: for the
Gospel destroys not the just laws of civil policy or Commonwealths; but I
will not enter upon the debate of this point, neither bringing in the
Scriptures or reasons for it, nor answering the arguments brought against it,
of which arguments this I suggest (by the way) to your observation, that some
of them do even ship in one bottom the moral duties commanded in the old
Testament, and the typical ceremonies or shadows. Some of them do make Which
Erast^s denies not as to Haereticks or such as keep not the faith, Th^s. 9. and
70.
against Ecclesiastical censures as well as civil, and some of them do carry
further then happily they are intended, even to take off civil punishments of
sins against the second Table also: neither do I see any just reason, that
if the office of a Magistrate have any place in the matters of the first Table,
he can punish sedition, which is against his own name or dignity, and stand
still and look on with his hands tied, whiles the name and honor of the great
God is openly traduced or blasphemed.

For the seducing Haereticke, he is to be prohibited and restrained: you will
not suffer a man that has a running plague sore to go abroad to infect, though
his shutting up be not in way of punishment, as if he was punished because he
has the sore, but in way of prevention of contagion, as the restraint of the
Leper was. You pull down another man's house and that justly when it is on fire
to prevent the burning of the whole Town: one way to put out the fire in the
Oven, is to shut it up. Many errors and haeresies would die of themselves if
they had not free vent. Falsi doctores sathanae lenones says Calvin: False
teachers are the Devils panders; would you suffer panders to come into your
houses and solicit the chastity of your children? would you suffer Mountebanks
to sell poison upon a stage, to destroy the bodies and lives of people? This
the Examen censurae, page 285.
Remonstrants in scorn call our palmarium argumentum: but it is not to be
despised as if it was void of reason. You that are Christian Magistrates should
not forget the souls of them that live under your shadow. There is a Minus
Celsus in disputatione de haereticis, etc. page 194. etc.
learned man who argues against the punishing of Haereticks with death, and
pitches upon this as the solida, vera, certa, ratio, the solid, true, and
certain reason why other flagitious offenders are to be punished, but not
Haereticks: because haeresie (says he) is the error of a depraved mind, an
intellectual error: but other moral vices arise from a depraved and corrupt
will, and the error of the understanding is not (says he) to be punished with
death, but that it is to be restrained from spreading and infecting, the
comparisons which he brings in do fully signify. For you would not (says he)
put a Physician to death as a murderer who upon mere mistake gives his patient
a potion of poison in stead of good medicine, nor a mad man that breaks out and
kills and slaies such as he meets with, because this proceeds from laesion of
his understanding, though I do not concur with this supposition that haeresie
is a a mere act of the understanding: for it has its denomination from the
act of the will choosing the error: yet thus far I go with it, that such
pretended Physicians as hold that to be wholesome which is poison, and minister
it to their Patients, are not to be licensed to practice, nor such mad men
suffered to be loose to exercise their fury; damnable haeresies can never be
prevented, if false teachers may have liberty to bring them in. Its one thing
to suffer Jews, Turks, Papists, Haeretickes, to live in the kingdom or City,
and another thing to give them liberty or freedom of Trade, to open their shop
and call in Customers to buy their destructive wares; Thou have them that hold
the Doctrine of the Nicolaitans, Revel. 2. 15. Thou suffer that woman
Jezebel which calls her self a Prophetess, to teach and to seduce my
servants, was a sore charge laid by Christ upon those Churches.

Nor is it the Pulpit which can keep off the infection, whiles the poison is
carried up and down in books, and cried at men's doors every day, in which
there are many strange doctrines going abroad open faced, and some more strange
which go veiled, and dropped into the Reader by insinuation, there seem to be
very strange dreams about the manner of Christ's being in the Saints, and Gods
being manifest in their flesh, and about the Kingdom of the Saints, and the
licking of the dust of their feet by the world. There are mysteries if the
world was ripe for them; I take notice of one thing in a late book which has a
very ill aspect, brought in by way of enquiry, what is meant by the word
Scriptures when it is asserted, that the denying of the Scriptures to be the
word of God, should be holden worthy of death. For says the Author, either the
English Scriptures, or Scriptures in English, are meant by the word Scriptures,
or the Hebrew and Greek Copies or originalls. The former cannot be meant with
reason, because God did not speak to his Prophets and Apostles in the English
tongue: nor does the English translation agree in all things with the original
or the true sense of it; Nor the latter, for the greatest part of men in the
Kingdom do not understand or know them. If this dilem be good, what is become
of the certain foundation of our hope or faith or comfort; how can we search
the Scriptures without going first to school to learn Hebrew and Greek. Its
well known that our Savior himself and the Apostles do usually cite the
Greek translation or Septuagint, when they quote the Scriptures of the old
Testament, and yet that translation had many variations in it from the
original, and happily more then our English translation has. The Apostle citing
a place out of the Septuagint, where they express not the original (...),
says (...) it is contained in Scripture, 1 Pet. 2. 6. And there is no question
but the Hellenists and western Jews scattered up and down in Greece and Italy,
etc. used the Greek translation of the Scriptures in their Synagogues, as
appears by the confluence of the Greeks and Gentiles to them who understood not
Hebrew, and yet they of Beraea, a city Plin. lib. 4. cap. 10. (...) Stephanus
(...).
of Macedonia, are commended for searching the Scriptures of the old Testament,
and examining of Paul's doctrine by them: and in that search there were Greeks
that bare the Jews company, as appears, Acts 17. 11, 12. And what Scriptures
could they search but the Scriptures of the Greek Translation; I could easily
demonstrate that the Scripture calls the original translated, scripture, and
not without just reason: for the Scripture stands not in cortice verborum but
in medulla sensus, its the same wine in this vessel which was drawn out of that.
Translations are but vessels or taps (as I may call them) to set Scriptures
abroach; as for faults and errors in that translation, if that argument be
able to batter and make a breach, let it but have rope enough, and it will make
as great a breach in the Hebrew, for when you come to find that there are variae
lectiones, and that in the Margent truer then that in the Text, as in that
famous place (...) in textu. (...) in margin. Vide Foord in Psalm 22.
Psalm. 22. 17. or shall question the true pointing or printing of the
original, whither will not this wild argument run away with you, until you
come to find the very original written by the Prophets own hand, or by the hand
of some amanuensis infallibly directed and guided; The Scriptures expressed in
English are the word of God. The deficiency of exact translation of this or
that particular word does not invalidate the canon or body of the Scriptures.
But I shall not further proceed in this chase; I have but a word or two left,
and that is to exhort you to quicken up your zeal for God and his truth:
search out and remove the obstructions that are in and amongst your selves,
whether private ends or State ends, or whatsoever they be. Let not Reformation
and religion be cried up for design, and to serve turns; settle it speedily.
Send forth the Confession that it may testify to the world that you hold the
form of sound and wholesome words: Let some government and order be
established; religion is the ball of contention, many men's hopes lie in our
differences, and their interests are served upon them. We have professed enough
for reformation and purity, and have covenanted to endeavor it. The world is
weary of words, they look for fruit; Let this day set an edge upon you. No man
take a breake-fast of this fast, let not our ruin be under your hand. There
was a But in Naamans story: he was such and such a man, but a Leper; You have
done worthily, Covenanted seriously: But the matter of Reformation lies most of
it as yet in the Covenant, and is but little crept out of that shell; It may be
the foolishness of many opinions on foot, makes you slight them, as Calvin in
opusc. de Serveto.
Calvin said of Servetus his first onset, securum me reddidit ipsa dogmatum
fatuitas: but be not secure, (...) Socrates lib. 1. de Arrio.
a great fire may rise out of a small spark. Let the souls of so many
thousands of people be precious in your eyes, and the Lord make your name like
the name of those that have built the house of God; I pray you let me not be
understood to ship in one and the same bottom every error or mistake with
damnable haeresies; some differences in opinion are as the strivings (as L.
Verulam* Advancement of learning.
one elegantly says) of one Israelite with another: and these Moses quiets and
parts them fairly, and some (namely haeresies fighting against the very
foundation) are like the Egyptian striving with the Israelite whom Moses smites
down. There must be differences made between error and haeresie, erroneous and
Heretics, seducers and seduced, I would I might entreat, nay press it upon
those that are called pure Independents, that they would zealously and
sincerely declare against the doctrinall errors and haeresies of these days,
that such pernicious opinions may not shelter themselves under their name or
wing, nor ever any indulgence or toleration be either desired or granted upon
such a reason, as all may come in at the same breach or port, for that would
be but a selling of the Church into a liberty of being in captivity to
destructive confusions and errors.
