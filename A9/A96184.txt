Strange and true News of an Ocean of Flies dropping out of a Cloud, upon the
Town of Bodnam in Cornwall.
To the Tune of Cheevy Chase.
When Kings have lost their Reigns and Power,
Then Clouds upon us judgments shower.
SOme talk of battles in the air,
And Comets in the skies,
But now wee*ll tell a tale more rare,
Of great and monstrous flies.
In Cornwall this strange sight was seen,
At Bodman Town by name,
Which will be justified still
By a Lawyer of great fame.
At midday* when the sky was clear,
A thick cloud did arise,
Which failing down upon the earth,
Dissolved into flies.
The hell-bred Cloud did look so big,
So black and did so loure,
It could not rest until her Panch
Those flies all out did pour.
They in such mighty numbers fell
Upon the green grass ground,
And did so cover all the earth,
That naught else could be found.
Their numbers did increase so fast,
Almost a whole hours space,
That they a foot and more were seen,
To cover all that place.
No grass, nor flowers for the time,
Were seen for to appear,
The like was not in England known,
God knows this many a year.
Their bodies green, their wings were white
As it appears most true,
By Letters sent from Bodnam Town,
By those we never knew.
These flies as soon as they were borne
Fell dead upon the ground;
And to say truth* they lay so thick,
The like was never found.
Which made the people all to muse,
To see that ghastly sight,
Which did continue on the ground
All that whole day and night.
The second Part,
To the same Tune.
SO when the Lord was pleased to frown,
And show his powerful hand
He rained Frogs and Lice upon
All the Egyptian land.
All which was for their sins so great,
So wicked, foul and dire,
They did deserve the judgment just
Of Brimstone and of fire.
And yet they never did rebel
Against their King and Crown*
Nor had such vices in their streets
As has our London Town,
Who has maintained this bloody war
Against a Cause so just;
And have destroy^d their gracious Prince
For to maintain their lust.
Wherefore repent you Citizens,
And take you warning all*
Lest that the Heavens in discontent
In Thunder on you fall.
In Lice and Locusts Worms and Frogs,
In Rain in Hail and Storms*
In Lightning Plague and Pestilence,
In Poxes and in Horns.
Now if these Plagues you will prevent,
Which will your corn destroy,
See that you presently repent,
And sing Vive le Roy.
God grant us Peace, which will not be
Unless our gracious King
Enjoy his rights and dignities,
His Queen and every thing.
God send Sir Thomas Fairfax right,
And send us our Areares,
And bring the King to Town again
Sans jealousies and fears.
