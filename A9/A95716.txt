This is to certify to all those whom it may Concern,
THat whereas by diverse Traders there are many Bibles dispersed abroad by
sundry Chapmen into all parts, which Books many of them be false Printed, and
very many deceitfully bound beyond the seas in Sheeps leather, and some gilded
with Party-gold, whereby the buyers being ignorant are much deceived, and not
only so cozened of their money, but the books are also forfeited and they
liable to the Law; this is to give notice,

That by provision of a Statute in Vicesimo Quinto Henrici Octavi, it was
Enacted, That no person or persons Resciant or Inhabitant within this Realm,
shall buy to sell again any Printed books brought from any parts out of the
Kings Obeisance, ready Bound in Bords, Leather, or Parchment, upon pain to lose
and forfeit for every such book Bound out of the said Kings Obeisance, and
brought into this Realm, and bought by any person or persons within the same,
to sell again, contrary to this Act, six shillings and eight pence.
