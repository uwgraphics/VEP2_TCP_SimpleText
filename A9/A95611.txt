THE AUTHOR TO THE READER.
Often have I seen Luxuriant Vicious Wit
A wanton Rape on a fair Muse commit:
At once distaining, by lewd Poetry,
The Writers Paper-sheets, and Readers Eye.
And may not I oblige the thrice three Muses
Chastely to serve so Sacred thrice three Uses?
Is the grave Body of Divinity
Less Current for the feet of Poetry?
Are Truths, for being short and sweet, less sound?
Or streams, for running smoothly, less profound?
David a Prophet, yet in Verse excels:
'Twas ECCLESIASTES made the Canticles.
To the Pious and Ingenious Author of this Tripartite Poem.
BEfore your triple Poems I admit,
These Votes made up of Threes, may well be writ.
May Understanding, Will, and Memory
Know, Love, and hold thy Sacred Poetry.
May Heaven be the fuller, Earth the better, Hell
The thinner, by the Truths, you write so well.
May pride of life, the lusts of flesh and eye,
Be poisoned by these leaves of thine, and die.
If any other three, I Would wish were down,
It Is Austria, Spain, the Pope with' striple Crown.
This latter Vote if the King of Kings would make
An Act, I Would willingly the Earth forsake.

FATHER.
THou that begin'st All things begin my ve^se
My words are wind;
Thy words are works:
Thou Wilt lightness find
Where darkness lurks:
My Pen and Ink may me not Thee rehearse.
My Pen is but a feathered vanity,
Like me that write;
Yet shall this feather,
If thou wilt indite,
Help me fly thither
Where Angels wings make ^ens beyond the sky.
Father, mine Inks dark hue, presents mine heart.
Ink's not more dark,
Ink's not more black;
One beam, one spark
Supply this lack.
Father of Lights, now show thy perfect Art.
Lord teach me speak and I Will not hold my peace:
Which if I should,
The stones would come;
Though deaf, yet would
They not be dumb;
Break into praises, stony heart, for these.
No man has seen thee, Father, but He who
Did sometime come
(Thy Son it was)
Thy bosom from,
Thy Looking-glass,
He Is the wise Child that does his Father know.
Who else sings Thee, sings what he has not seen:
My Verse has feet,
And fain would run
Thy praise to meet;
But, lest the Sun
Should hurt weak fight, the clouds do interveen.
Then may I in thy Son thy self discover;
Sure He Is the Mirror
That shows thy face:
Prevent mine error;
Christ's flesh like glass
A brighter Glory, but unseen does cover.
Since then I must be silent, or begin
To sing the unseen;
Father of Mercies,
That set'st the screen,
Forgive my Verses:
Oh thou that vail'st their subject, vail their sin.
Father's a word my child learns first to mutter,
And thy child too,
Thy newborn Babe
First thing 't can do
Is to cry Ab;
But both come last to know what first they utter.
Thou art the Father of that Son that made
That womb on earth
That, without Father,
Did give him birth;
And might the rather,
He bee'ng begot where He no Mother had.
Then shall I call thee Father? Lord, thy Son
Was called no less
Before his birth;
Prophets confess
He had on earth
His children, seed and generation.
The Eternal Father call we Thee? or rather
Thy Child, thy Son
Born to restore us,
Thine Holy One
Given to us, for us?
I Will call Thee the Everlasting Fathers Father.
All that is in God is God; and needs must be.
Thou made mine eye,
Could thou forbear
Thy self to spy?
Or so to rear
The blessed Image of thy self in Thee?
Surely thou could no more thy self not view;
Then, Lord, not love
Thy self when seen;
From whence thy Dove,
As hatched between
Thy face and Looking-glass, sprung forth and flew.
Then shall I not beleev You Are One, yet Three?
Father, and Son,
And sacred Spirit,
That equal run,
One bliss inherit?
Lord, I Will believ Thee surely such to be.
Yet you are the FATHER still: Those sparkling things,
Are sons of God:
Those winged flames
That fly abroad,
(Thou know their names)
Made without Bodies, made all face and wings.
Faces they have, and eyes and tongues, with these,
To see and sing:
But O their Grace!
A sixfold wing
To every face!
Wise, happy, humble, obedientiall.
Lend's wings, dear Dove; we lag and lose our traffic.
Poor short-leg'd Rhymes,
Verses on foot
Reach Seraphims,
They cannot do it.
Lord, now if ever make my Muse seraphique.
Or if I may not have wings, and so keep sight
Of these bright flames,
Shades of thy glory
Yet tell's their names
And tell's their story;
And lend's a quill, dear Dove, and I Will go write.
Write Angels. Lord, it is done: but who are they?
Servants, or sons?
Subjects or Kings?
Footstools, or Thro^es?
Inferior things,
Or Principalities? What shall I say?
Sometimes I hear thee call them Elohim;
Yet they were made:
These plumed things
Are but the shade
Of thy bright wings,
Before whose Sunshine, all these Stars are dim.
Sometimes 't should seem that they but servants are;
Or Ministers
To wait upon
Salvations heirs,
And guard thy Throne.
Yet these stand covered where thy sons stand bare.
Servants they are, and yet Dominions:
Each holds his Crown
By casting it
Most humbly down
Before thy feet.
Father, thy Throne's erected on the Thrones.
Thousands of thousands of these finite Gods
On every side,
I mean the Cherubs,
When thou do ride,
Some serve for stirrups,
And some thou hold in thy hands for rods.
Archangels, Angels that sixwinged Nation.
Stand trembling, Lord,
Pressed to obey
Their Makers word;
And glad they may
By all their running but maintain their station.
These cannot forget that early Funeral;
These cannot forget
Those morning-Stars
That rose and set,
Whose inbred wars
Blew up themselves. But oh -- their fall!
Yet You Are the FATHER still: these Absoloms
Their beeings had
And beauties, Lord,
But not theit trade
Nor Traitors sword
From Thee from whom All good, and only comes.
How came these then to fall? 't should seem that under
Their Angels wings
Each laid some evil
(Oh wretched things!)
And hatched a Devil.
And so by sinning singed their wings. What wonder?
Thy fine white linen, Lord, sin burnt to tinder.
Satan's thy creature,
But now does want
First form and feature,
Oh miscreant!
Thou made him bright, but sin turned all to cinder.
Yet you are the FATHER still: those Stars in view,
Lanterns hung out
In all men's sights
Thy Court about,
Those various lights
FATHER of Lights there dwelling clearly show.
That golden Globe comes trundling from thine hand:
Father, thou say
Thou Sun of mine
Run East and West,
Cease not to shine
Rounding my Bowling-green of Sea and Land.
That burnisht silver Ball's hurled forth by Thee:
That Moon of thine
That always ranges,
Does sit and shine,
In constant changes,
Says plainly He that changes not made me.
The Pleiades, cluster of six, called seven:
The Signs twice six;
The Errant Train:
The Stars that fix:
The Northern Wain
And all the Constellations of the Heaven:
The Great Orion with those Bands of his:
Stars Great and Least:
The Milkie way,
With All the Rest,
Does plainly say
That He whose Breasts drop Lights their Father is.
The Archt Expanse, whose Props who can descry?
That surging Roof,
And Saphyre-cieling
Yields ample proof,
To all men's feeling,
It had its rise from Thee, O thou most High!
Those stately Offices all on a row,
Standing about
Thy spangled Court,
And yet without
For greater Port;
Thee Father of Heavens Family do show.
There stands thy Minting-house, thy Bulloign brought
From 'ts place of birth;
Vapors, I mean,
From drossie earth
Are there made clean;
And, as thou please, cast and coined and wrought.
There stands thy Treasury; that does contain
Gems in great store
Of orient hue:
Who can count over
Thy Pearls of dew?
Thy golden Lightnings? or thy silver Rain?
There stands thy Wardrope. Lord, the purple shrouds
Which thou do use,
And dapled sky,
Like Ermins, shows
Thy Majesty.
And when thou will thou wea^'st the gold-fring'd clouds.
There stands thy stable-room. Sometimes thy mind's
To ride abroad;
That men below,
There is a God
Above may know
Hearing the neighings of thy prancing winds.
There Is thy distillatorie. Thence thou do
Heavens drops distill
In such great store
Earth drinks its fill
Till 't needs no more.
Then the cold ashes are cast forth in Frost.
There stands thy great Confectionary. There
Those heaps of Snow
Double-refin'd
Do clearly show,
And bring to mind
That they belong to the Great Confectioner.
It Is He that makes those Frost-works. He that makes
Moist Drops, when cast
In's Comfit-mold,
Hailstones at last,
When they grow cold,
It Is He that candies all the Icie flakes.
There stands thy Magazine. Thou do erect
Thy flaming forges,
And there prepare
Thy shafts and scourges,
Weapons of war
Which, when thou will, thy Rebel foes correct.
Storms, tempests, thunders, thunderbolts with these,
Great and small shot,
Brimstone and fire,
Father, what nor?
If thou require,
Dart thence to chastise those that thee displease.
Whole Egypt from thy storm of Hail shot runs.
His Heathen-Head
That Royal slave
Slunk under-bed,
When the Heavens gave
But one round volley from thy greater guns.
You Are the Rains Father. Frost thou'st gendred?
What Prose or Verses
Can better show
Thy tender Mercies
Then melting Dew?
This shows thine Heart, and hoary frost thine Head.
The Ancient of Days begat me, says the Snow.
The Lord of Hoasts
's my Fathers Name
The Thunder boasts,
And Lightnings flame.
I carry Fathers Colors, says the Bow.
So you are the FATHER still: Lord, it is alleged
By the Feathered Hosts,
That here and there
The Aeriall Coasts
And Quarters bear,
Under thy Wings they were both hatched and fledged.
That Bird of Paradise, Lord, thou must owe it.
With chattring cries,
Swallows and Cranes
Plead the Only wise
Did hatch our Brains
And He that made our season, made us know it.
'Twas God All-seeing made my piercing Eye
Do h the Eagle say.
To the God of Love
Our broods we lay,
Says Stork and Dove:
If these be ours, sure we are thy Progeny.
With early visits and salutes from Earth
Up the Lark climbes,
As if it meant,
With Seraphims
Of high descent
By vieing notes and wings, prove equal birth.
The plumed Ostriches forget their young;
But thou their Father
With careful hand
Their Eggs do gather
Laid in the sand,
Hatching to life, and hideing them from wrong.
The goodly Peacock with his Argus-train,
His Angels plumes,
His well-set border,
Strongly presumes
To th'God of Order,
Unto whose pomp this splendor does retain.
The tumbling Deeps where all the waters gather
Roundly declare
That Name of His
Whose Counsels are
The Great Abyss:
Seas swell too big to own a meaner FATHER.
Surely the Ocean's thine. Lord, is it not?
Thou bid'st it boil,
But not boil over:
And 't does recoile
Within the shore,
Thou do both furnish, Lord, and salt the Pot.
Thou, Great-House-keeper, must the Fish Pond owe,
Whose banks and shores
Are Rocks and sands,
Whose fullness stores
All Coasts and Lands,
For thou the greatest Family can show.
These Waterworks are thine invention, Lord.
Is the Oceans force,
When most serene,
Charged by thine Horse,
Thy Winds, I mean?
What mighty banks and trenches, Lord, appear?
Under the covert of these surging Seas
Those Armed Bands
(Each jointed scale
Like Armor stands,
Or Coats of Male)
March here and there securely as they please.
Leviathan that moving Mount or Fort,
Who can deride
storms battering,
Of Sons of pride
Thou call'st Him King;
There tumbles he to make his Maker sport.
So you are the FATHER still. Even Earth can cry
From Cliffs and Mountains,
Hills high and steep;
Sprin^s, Mines, and Fountains
That run so deep,
How deep's thy wisdom, Lord? thy power how high?
Thou gav'st the Rocks their Rise. Springs sprang from thee.
Great Architect!
Earths Fabric fair
Thou did erect,
And hang in the Air
To show its Makers Independancy.
Thy very footstool, Lord, thou do inlay
With Mines of gold,
And silver Ore;
Who can unfold,
Or prize the store,
Wherewith thou do enrich poor dust and clay?
This inlay'd footstool thou have round beset
With Vegetants.
Who can declare
Those various Plants,
Their Virtues rare,
That spring from dust of heavenly Fathers feet?
Those short-lived Beauties that the Florists gather
Look up a while,
With a fair Eye;
Give God a smile:
And though they die
Yet leave such seed as plainly shows their Father.
You Are fruitful Parent of All Trees fruit-bearing.
Who does not see
Earth does but nurse
These Plants for thee?
Thine Heavens disburse
Continual payments for these Plants up-rearing.
Some Trees there are, though suckled with earths sap.
Yet run upright;
As if they meant,
By their vast height,
Prove their descent,
And lay their Leavie Locks in Fathers lap.
Others there are too weak to rise alone,
Yet seem to know
Where Father dwells;
Why should they go
To Neighbors else
To borrow crutches, to run up upon?
The Herds, the Folds, the Beasts innumerable:
The multifarious
Creeping Creatures,
Whose food is various
As their features,
Cry still to God, Our FATHER, spread our Table.
Father, to Live, thy Gift alone can be;
Earth's cold and dead,
And cannot give
To what it bred
To breath or live,
Surely the fountain of all Life's with thee.
This spacious House thus built, and furnished so;
Come let us convey
Our Image just,
Did the Father say,
To breathing dust;
Leaving our likeness to keep House below.
Then was clay stamped, by Act of Parliament,
With God's bright face:
A Creature Crowned
Wish Life and Grace:
Heaven-born, Heav'n-bound,
Of upright aspect, of Divine descent.
Father, thy footsteps we may find and gather
All other-where,
But in this creature,
Thy face shines clear,
Witness his feature;
Who reads man's face may quickly spell his Father.
Said I, one may? my God, I should have said
One might have done:
But things fall cross:
Flesh turns to stone,
Pure gold to dross,
Silver degenerates to dirt and lead.
Said I, there is? I should have said there was:
My God! there was
Thy countenance
So in his face,
That every glance
The shining Sun in brightness did surpass.
Father, this walking, talking Plant was He
Whom thou did love,
Whom thou did prize
All Plants above.
Thy Paradise
Thou soon did quit when thou had lost this Tree.
From the side whereof a female plant did spring
A splended pair?
Now the Earth begins
TO outshine the Air,
Where Heavens bright twins
(The Sun and Moon) their Light, as tribute, bring.
Woman to man's a gift of Gods own giving,
(That man alone
No more might be;
Yet as much one,
And one with thee.)
A gift endors'd with Doners Name, the living.
This Royal consort to complete man's joy
Thou God of Union
Did well provide
For chaste Communion
As his dear Bride
Whom thou have crowned on Earth as thy Viceroy.
So the little world, with greatest work and skill,
Was framed at last,
And being the best
Its grace was past
To rule the rest.
Nothing's forbidden but its knowing ill.
Upon thy footstool thou had built a Throne
For man to sit,
My God, at thine;
And at his feet
Thou did consigne
All other things in due subjection.
Thou gav'st him Life, 'twas fit should give him Law.
His fear did fall
By thy command,
On Creatures All
In Sea and Land;
He standing only in his Fathers Awe.
His Diadem was bright Intelligence,
Wisdom in full,
Whose every spark
Makes Diamonds dull,
And Gems look dark;
His Ermine Robe was purest Innocence.
A Rationall-Plant-Animal was he:
Could vegetate,
Could Move and walk,
Could contemplate,
Discourse and talk:
Fair Issue of the Blessed Trinity!
Parents own Picture! wise, just, holy Son!
Thou made that star,
His Heart, to be
Triangular,
Yet one with thee,
Who art the Ever-blessed Three in One.
That Instruments Three Strings thou God Trin-Unc.
(The Intellect, Will
And Memory)
Did Wisdoms skill,
And Sanctity,
And Righteou^ness give charge to keep in Tune.
And, Oh! What rare and ravishing content
My God did take?
Till, on a day,
A fall did crack
(spoiling his play)
The strings together with the Instrumenc.
But, oh, what tongue? what pen? what prose? what verse?
What tears? what cries?
What melting moanes?
What sobs? what fight?
What piercing groans
Can man's so sudden, so sad fall rehearse?
Of late a most complete and upright Piece
My God did frame,
Of crooked bone:
But the Serpent came,
When God was gone,
And wound his work to greater crookedness.
Wound out of Heaven, but into Paradise,
In a Friends guise,
That cankerd Devil,
By fallacies,
Drew Eve to evil:
And thus the Mother of all living dies.
Man being thus on the one side mortified,
How quickly does
The Gangrene spread?
Infecting both
The heart and head.
Thus Adam lived and reigned, rebelld and died.
Down comes the Son by leaping Fathers hedge:
An Apple there,
As some do gather,
But a choak-Pear
As I think rather,
Did tempt him, Oh my teeth are yet on edge!
O fruit, Death was thy fruit! thy gall, thy foot
Me thinks I taste
With all my bread;
Which makes me have
Unto the dead:
Thou bredst that worm that killed me in my root.
Which bee'ng once withered, root and branch did fall
With such aweight
Made the earth to groan
From such an height
Man fell upon
The inferior creatures, and so crushed them all.
These subjects, thus oppressed, soon take up Arms
Against Rebell-Man,
Heavens deputy,
(Who first begun
to mutiny
Against his Sovereign) to revenge their Harms.
For sin that made man Naked, Armed the Earth:
So poor man scrambles,
In sweat and blood,
'Midst thorns and Brambles
For sorry food,
Till's Dust turns thither whence it had its Birth.
Now the Earth, that sometimes owned him for its King
Makes him Distrain
With plow or spade
For every grain
Or't cannot be had,
That wont, of'ts own Accord, its Tribute bring.
Man having broke Gods Peace, all turns to strife:
Against his Creator
Even Dogs proclaim
Fallen man a Traitor.
A two edged Flame
Cries Come not, Rebel, near this Tree of Life.
Besides these wares without that worm does gnaw
Man's in most soul;
A worm late breeding
O the fruit he stole,
Whereof man feeding
Became as broken as his Makers Law.
Yet you are the FATHER: these mourning Verses
Do prove thee so;
Man's miseries,
The Creatures woe,
And all their cries
Plainly proclaim thee FATHER of all mercies.
Thy Providence and Patience toward man
Do seem to strive,
O blessed strife --
Who shall reprieve
The Traitors life,
By lenghthening out his poor contracted span.
Though man made so much have to stir thine ire;
Yet thou art slow,
My God, thou art;
I find it so:
Thou melt'st mine heart
With burning Coals, but of another fire.
Thine En'my hungers, and thou giv'st him food:
Thine En'my thirsts,
Thou giv'st him drink:
Oh! mine heart bursts.
Oh! Who would think
Man were so bad, that sees his God so good?
Father, Thou make thy Sun still shine on those
That lowr on thee;
And when Heaven lowers
It Is love we see;
For fruitful showrs
Thou make then to fall on thankless foes.
Man, what art made of? Do not feel that Sun,
Dissolve the Ice?
But thou art Clay,
Th'harder for this:
Yet showrs, we say,
Soften the hardened Clay; But thou art stone.
Father, When man had ceased thy son to be,
And turned thy foe,
Yet did thou not
Desert him so;
Nor have forgot
To set thy child, though battered, on thy knee.
When man first, stripped himself, and showed his shame,
Clothes from the Backs
Of Beasts less wild,
Man's FATHER takes
To dress his Child:
Man lost his Robe, and Beasts must bear the blame
Could I, to cloth a Foe, thus strip a Friend?
My God! My God!
What have these done?
And yet thy Rod,
Due to thy Son
Falls on these servants backs that never find.
Thus Man's both fed and clad at thine expense,
Kept at thy charge,
Yet keeps it not;
But lives at large,
As having got
His force to fight thee from thy Providence.
Heaps upon Heaps! One load upon another!
God gives Man store,
Like a Dear Friend,
Man sins the more,
Till in the end,
Or Mercies sins, or sins do Mercies smother.
Yet you are the FATHER still: of mercies Father:
When through sins curse,
Such Rebels dye;
Thou do yet nurse
Their Progeny:
As the Hen her Chickens, so thou do them gather.
Thus are all things conserved since the fall,
Both man and Beast:
The Raven's fed:
The Lillie's dressed;
Then put to Bed.
All Is kept in 'ts kind, or Individual.
How beauteous in its season is each thing?
Summer supplies
What Winter spends:
When Autumn dies,
Such stock descends
As may set up the next succeeding Spring.
Thy Providence makes Clouds feed The Earth with Rain:
The Earth feed the Plant;
Plant, th'Animal:
So there is no want,
Nor wast at All.
Then the Earth with Vapors feeds the Clouds again.
By these, the Marshes make the Mountains drink,
And liquid Seas,
At thy Commands,
Water, by these,
The parched Lands.
Who, but thy self should such a thing forethink.
Thou do for every mouth provide a Meat:
For every meat,
A mouth provide:
Thy Board's full set
On every side:
If ought do fall to the ground, that the earth does eat.
Father, for All things thou do well provide.
Thou did Erect
This fair Creation,
And do project
Its preservation:
And being the Housekeeper art the great House-Guide.
Thou serv'st Thy self of All. Even Satan's Brain
Ripens thy Plot;
And his design,
When he thinks not,
Promoteth thine:
Thou make that Blacksmith forge his own dark chain.
Thou make man's wrath praise thee: And all his evil
Thou turn'st to good:
In all man's Story,
Even in man's blood,
Thou sav'st thy glory:
Goodness rules all in spite of man and Devil.
Yea such is Fathers care, and Fathers skill,
When foolish man,
Led by that elf,
Does all he can,
TO undo himself,
TO extract man's greatest good from such an ill.
So thou 'rt the FATHER still: Thy new Creation
Most sweetly shows
Thy Father-hood:
My God renews
Fallen man to good:
By a new word through the Spirits Incubation.
Adam comes forth but in a new Edition:
Gods bright Portraiture
Is new impressed,
The Divine Nature,
On man's breast;
Clear from all treason, and from all Misprision.
Father, thou soak'st this Adament in blood
Of thy firstborn.
Mine heart, I felt,
Did the impress scorn,
And would not melt
Till that red Sea resolved it to a flood.
Father, I heard thee beg the Rebels peace
Rising betimes
To open thy doors:
For all my crimes,
My God implores
Me to take pardon for my wickedness.
Then said I turn me O my Lord my God!
And I will turn
To bear thy yoke;
Mine heart does burn
That I it broke.
O my dear child! I Will run and burn my rod.
Thus spoke my father. Pains oth' second birth
Did pinch and grieve,
But Gods dear strength
Did soon relieve:
And at the length,
His child bee'ng washed and dressed, my God makes mirth.
Nor does man's elder brother grudg or grieve,
But sing and smile,
Angels do shout
Heaven rings the while
The whole court throughout,
To see poor spend-thrift man return and live.
Man thus adopted and regenerate
Searches his Fathers
L^st Testam^nt,
And thence man gathers
H av'ns full ^nte^t
For his inheritance and fa^ur st^^^.
Thou prov'st thy self my FATHER all these waie^
Now let thy Dove,
Teach me to fear,
To s ve and love,
Thee, Father Dear,
Proving my self thy Child, even all my Days.
If you call on the FATHER, pass the time of your sojourning herein fear,

1 Pet. 1.17. SON.
O Let that Dove, that sometimes did thee Crown
With yellow Gold,
And silver Plumes,
Unto thy Poet Thee unfold
That humbly by thy leave presumes,
To spread thy fame and scatter thy Renown.
Let thine Heroic Spirit guide my Verse
If thou the thing
Indite,
I Will write
Touching the King,
What my weak willing heart would fain rehearse.
'Twas when Augustus Cesaer laid a Tax
On all the Earth,
Grace called for Thee.
'Twas then thy Mother gave thee Birth,
That thou might set all Nations free,
Heavens fair Impression's stamped on Virgin Wax.
To us a Child is born, grace gives a Son,
Heavens were too bold,
To say
That they
That King can hold,
Who now into a Manger crowds His Throne.
For since sin made man brutish like the Rest
My God did lay;
The Bread of Life,
Come down from Heaven amongst Oats, and Hay,
That man might find his food as rise,
Yea find his Savior whilst he seeks his Beast.
It Is not the Cloth but Crown that shows the King.
A Cave's a Court,
If there
Appear
The Princes Port.
Wise men, what means your Star, your sparkling thing?
Sure you can read by that Oriental light
What is this stranger,
That makes his Bed,
In this poor Cottage, Crib, and Manger;
Hav'ng no where else to lay his Head?
It Is Christ, Earths Joy, Hels Torment, Heavens Delight.
Satan, it is Christ my Crown, but Christ thy terror,
Bite if thou dare;
His heel,
I feel,
Is somewhat bare;
But thy bruised head shall ever rue thine error.
All wise men do, but foolish sinners do not
Lie prostrated,
Before this Babe,
Being lodged in such a poor straw-beds
Nor, to this newborn child, cry, Ab;
They 're so unwise their Masters crib they know not.
My Lord at eight days old began to bleed
For my disease:
To free
Poor me,
Not for's own ease:
Surely this martyrs blood's the Churches seed.
Then went he to his Temple with his Mother.
One Dove, me thought,
That blessed maid,
Might then have spared, that Lamb being brought
Before the Lord, whose fleece if laid
But rightly on, the worlds whole sin might smother.
From thence, my Lord, posts into Egypts-land.
Have at thy head,
Black Prince,
For since
Egypts dark bed
Has lodged this light, what dungeon can withstand?
When Bethl'hem first gave Judahs Lion breath
He boldly wades
Through the seav'n fold stream:
The Dragons country he invades,
On their own ground thus daring them.
Thence safe returning dwells at Nazareth.
Can any good come thence? fair Nazarene!
Thou dwell there:
Bu^, Lo!
The Snow
Is not so clear
As thou can make the Black-Moore sinner clean.
At twelve years old my Lord went thence to sit
In The Temple, which
Never shines so bright
As when my Savior does enrich
Its darkened windows with his light,
There sits the child to teach the Doctors wit.
The seav'ntieth week being come, the time foreset,
In Daniels book,
Foretold
Of old:
My Savior took
Baptism to him a type of's bloody sweat:
Then was the water washed that scoures my dress
My God, my Christ:
Thou could not need
For thine own sake a John Baptist:
But that thou might cleanse thy seed,
You Are pleased thus to fulfill all righteousness.
Jordan's the cleaner, Lord, for washing thee:
Has John indeed,
To be
By thee
Baptized, such need?
O my baptized Redeemer! Sprinkle me.
Christ, thence ascending, meets his own dear dove
Descending, while
The bridegroomes friend,
The Baptist, does both see and smile
Whose ears that heavenly voice attend
O son of all my pleasure, all my love!
From Egypt called, the baptismall sea being crossed,
My Lord, sets foot
In have
On the wast:
Heaven drives him to it;
To learn in the desert, how to seek the lost.
Now with the Lion does the Lamb converse
God sends his Child,
His hand to lay;
Upon these Beasts that are most wild
Till he has taught them to obey:
Tygres, Wolves, Leopards, Beasts most fell and fierce.
My Lord's sent thither sure to learn to tame
Man's brutish heart;
(More wild,
Less mild,)
By dear bought art:
^o turn the Savage sinner to a Lamb.
The fiery Serpent of the Wilderness
Finding Christ there,
Does spit and bite;
But the Brazen Serpents hard and clear,
Scorning the tempters craft and spite,
The Bullet's batt'red, but not the fortress.
Our Lord now learns to fast that we might feast
And to be tempted,
That we
Might be
Thereby exempted:
Or succored so as still to have the best.
If thou be the Christ, this Stone to Bread convert,
Why fool, the Stone,
Which thou would move,
Is Bread already, or there is none,
My Lord was hungry for my love;
Yet he is the strengthening Bread of poor man's heart.
Taking this Rock thence to a Mountain high,
Says Satan, See;
If thou Will bow
And worship me:
Those Kingdoms all i will give thee instantly.
Why, fool! Must the Son buy freedom of a slave,
Hark how thy Chain
Does clatter at,
Thine heel? My Lord was born to reign:
An Universal Monarchs state,
To him long since Heavens Letters Pattents gave.
To th'Temples Pinnacle, the Churches Head,
Is hurried next:
Bee'ng there,
I hear,
Hell took a Text;
The Wolf by preaching would the Lamb preach dead.
Jump down: It Is written The Angels shall thee catch
Say th'Tempters lips;
And that he might
Persuade my Lord to leap, he skips,
Those words should set his Doctrine right
Angels our ways ('it is not our Trespass) watch.
Thy neck-verse found, in reading, do thou Falter,
Yet seem to preach?
For thee
Can be
No Clergy, Wretch!
Thus Haman sometime handsel'd his own halter.
The tempter bee'ng at last turned off the Ladder,
My Lord sits still
Being firmer stone,
Then th'wrestling-place, the Pinnacle
From whence he threw bold Satan down:
Then the Angels bring a Chariot from his Father.
This chosen vessel these temptations season.
Now he will begin
To preach
In each
Place he comes in.
BELIEV'S his doctrine; MIRACLES, his reason.
Yet who makes USE? for every tribe but one
This great High Priest,
Amongst all, does get
Whom very near his sacred breast
As precious jewels he may set;
And of this twelve, one's but a Bristow stone.
For his first proof Christ water turns to wine,
At the marriage feast.
O pure!
Sirs, sure
It may be guest
You to your wedding did invite the Vine.
If this free vine does yield so rich a store;
Who can express
What plenty shall
Flow from thy cross, my God, thy press
When they have bruised thy clusters all?
May this Vines blood be my wine evermore!
Well done for the first: Can do it again? Lord, do it;
Convert my Verse,
To thine
Own wine,
My water-terse:
Renew thy miracle upon thy Poet.
Soon after to his temple goes my God,
His house of Prayer:
Where the sheep and dove
Are sold as if there were a fair.
But where is innocence and love?
It Is time, Lord, in thine house to use thy rod.
Does avarice with thy temple make thus bold?
The next step hence
That we
Shall see
This sin commence,
The temple of thy body must be sold.
To seek the sunshine, comes a man by night,
Hav'ng seen the things
My Lord had wrought.
Heavens mysteries my Lord (forth brings
But finds the teacher, how untaught?
Night's most within, but Christ turns all to light.
After, this Fountain, thirsting, seek a well:
But finds a ditch
Within
With sin
All foul, the which
He searches first; does all her doings tell:
Then, by revealing her, himself reveal
To be the Christ:
Samaria finds
What blind Jerus'lem sought and mist.
You Are Christ to all kindreds and kinds,
That by believing set to thee their seal.
Then says Disciples, Master, eat we pray
But he had got
A meat
To eat
Which they knew not
For he would gone eating, working, all the day.
Bee'ng thence returned again to Galile,
A Noble man,
For's dying son
Begs a Reprieve of's Sovereign,
The man believed it should be done,
And what he first believed did quickly see.
Happy that Son, whom Gods Son quickens!
More noble sure,
He is
For this
Even for his care;
Bee'ng thus by th'Prince of life reprieved from death*
Then to Bethesda's Pool, Salvations Well
Carries a cure
And gives't away;
The Jews this carriage cannot endure,
But think Christ hurts the Sabath Day,
Whilst he poor man, for whom 'twas made does heal.
Is there no cure, my God, for unbelief?
Amongst all thine art,
Does there
Appear
None to impart,
To this disease a suitable relief.
My Lord invites five thousand to a feast:
No store of dishes
Bee'ng dressed or cooked;
That, by five loves and two small fishes,
Their unbelief might all be chok'd,
Whilst in their mouths their meat's so much increast.
Yet ^^e next day, as if they would never been fed,
These very men
Do fret,
And whet,
Their teeth again,
Not to feed on, but to back-bite Heavens Bread.
After, The man born blind to sight's restored
By paste of clay,
Surely I should
Have blinded seeing-eyes that way
Bee'ng so far, Lord, from doing good.
Yet Jews in these new eyes, cannot see the Lord.
Thou take a living mon'ment from a grave.
Thy foes may see
The dead
Raised;
Yet they would kill thee,
Oh, my dear Lord, what sign would sinners have?
Devils are all cast out, but unbelief,
Dead Palsies too
Receive their cure;
But Oh, Dead hearts, what aileth you,
That you do more and more obdure.
Not miracles, but blood must cure this grief.
Ah! My dear Lord, the withered hand is healed:
And yet the hand
Of faith
Who has?
Jews still withstand:
And after all, to whom's thine arm revealed?
Fevers are quenched; yet fury burns amain:
Issues of blood
Are stanched quite:
All evils, but their spleen find good;
And the bloody issues of their spite.
Oh! how Jews hate the good Samaritan!
Do Pharisees wash often? Ah! they have need:
Leperds do clear,
But then
These men
The liv'ry wear.
Gebazi's curse is on them and their seed.
Who cures their Phrensies, cannot their rage allay,
They contradict
The tongue that taught
The dumb to speak: yea when convict
By the strange cures my Savior wrought
In Falling-sicknesses, yet fall away.
Creeples get legs; yet man's opinions halt
Who thou should be:
One while
They smile,
Then lowre on thee;
But thou art still the same: Lord! where is the fault?
For thy good works their heardned hearts do stone thee.
Sure it displeases
That they have health,
And that thou carri'st their diseases;
Scattering amongst thy poor the wealth.
My God, even of thine own how few do own thee!
Oh! how they daily carpe at righteousness!
Life may not live,
If they
But may
The sentence give.
They plot to bring salvation to distress.
To drag the resurrection to the grave:
Earths health to anguish:
How fain would they
See their dear-cheap Physician languish
Who freely cures them all the day.
Him to destroy they plot, he them to save.
My Lord, thy patience is a miracle
Amongst all the rest
(As we
May see)
None of the least.
My Lord! If I may judge it does excel.
Oh! how they grudg my Lord his drink and food!
The Bread, the Vine,
Sent down to us,
As bee'ng a bibber of much wine
They tax, and call him gluttonous
Who Is only greedy for to do them good.
These dunghils to asperse the sun begin.
He casts out evil,
Yet they
Do say
He has a Devil;
Sinner, they call the fountain open for sin.
He is the Son of the Carpenter, say some;
The Son of God,
You might have said,
Who raised Heavens roof you see so broad,
Such Carpentry's no such mean trade,
Helping to ground-sill all this lower room.
Others object, that they his country know,
The place from whence
He came
Can name,
And how long since.
Why, Sirs, pray when did you to Heaven go?
Then they persuade us that the King speaks treason
Because he makes
Himself to be
God as he is: Because he takes
His own, they cry out robbery.
Lord all men have not Faith, all have not reason.
Sometimes he is not Cesars friend, they say,
Who Is Cesars King.
Yet he,
We see,
Makes fish to bring
Tribute to him, that he may Cesar's pay.
Then they cry out, that he is the sinners friend.
But, Oh! that they,
That thus exclaim,
Had rightly known what now they say,
The counsel that to sinners came,
From his dear friendly lips they would more attend.
To make Christ clash with Moses they project.
The great Lawgiver
Does teach
Its breach;
This they deliver
Who would the Copy by the Proof correct.
How sharp their sight to find faults where are none?
But Oh! how dim
For to descrie
That radiant deity in him?
And most of all, how blind to spy
Those great prodigious evils of their own?
The Temple he would destroy, and then rebuild
This, Jews object;
But what
Of that?
Themselves project
How the Temple of Christ's Body might be killed.
How malice mixed with blindness all misconstr'es!
My Lord so spoke
As never did Man:
Yet's words and works too they will mistake,
Say he, or do he what he can.
To match his miracles they bring forth monsters.
Have Rulers or have Pharisees believed?
The Law we know;
Say those
His foes.
Ah! if it were so
The Lawmakers would sure have been received.
Yet this good Shepherd finds some straggling sheep:
The Gospel-net
Some Fishers takes:
Some at receipt of custom set
Christ's customers his market makes.
And what he finds he will spend his life but keep.
Some wise and noble too, although not many
King Jesus Court
Can show:
And so
To keep his Fort
There Is one Centurion, Lord it is well there is any.
Mary the unclean from whom as many Devils,
As muddie Nile
Has streams, are cast:
Each flood had its own Crocodile:
Yet she becomes one stream at last
Of Gospel-penitence for all her evils.
Christ's feet washed with her tears her hair makes dry:
And Christ again
With blood
Makes good
Her ways unclean:
And with forgiveness wipes the weepers eye.
A Canaanite to the King of Hebrews comes,
Begs and implores
At Isreal's feast
Some succor from those sacred stores
That Jesus for the Jews had dressed.
Whilst Children slight their bread, she leaps at crumbs.
A little man, but sinner not the least
Climbes up on high
That he
The tree
Of life might spy;
And in the fruitless Sycamore a feast.
Mary, the Lords Messiah, does anoint;
Disciples grudge,
And think it too good
For him who thinks not too much
To spend on them his precious blood.
See how one Judas puts all out of joint?
Bee'ng thus anointed Christ as King appears,
And forth does go,
As King
Riding
To Sion so.
Who brings salvation, him an Ass-Colt bears:
Thus foolish things, and things that men despise
The Lord does choose;
That this dumb Ass
Might preach performance to the Jews
Of what of old forespoken was;
And Christ by weakness might confound the wise
Judah! thy sceptr^'s gone but Shiloh's come.
Jerusalem!
Look out,
And shout,
For David's stem
Now springs a fresh in thy Lawgivers room.
Children, by their Hosannahs loudly cried,
Do testify
My Saviors praise,
That he might still his foes thereby,
His Name these Babes and sucklings rais^,
Whilst the Elders and the Fathers him deride.
Thus whilst the Fathers fall in the Wilderness,
Children inherit;
Why, lo
Even so
It pleased the Spirit,
What men deny, to teach poor Babes confess.
What Jews reject poor Greeks make friends to see.
Sion, take heed
Thou be n't the hive
That others does with honey feed,
Not tasting what it self does give;
Whilst Gentiles steal away thy Christ from thee.
What needs more proof? my Lord puts on the rack
Devils themselves
(Though Jews
Refuse,
As worser elves)
Till they to him a full confession make.
Would you believe, if your high Priest should tell
Or who is the Christ,
Should testify?
Sure your own Caiaphas little mist
Saying, 'twas meet this man should dye
For the people, that they perish not: GO-SPELL:
How sweetly sings this Swan before them all!
Though envy fumes
His skin
Within
His whited plumes,
Their High Priest sings Heavens High Priests Funeral.
Thus men teach Parrots speak, but what they know not;
The High Priest cries
(And surely he
Should know) this man's your Sacrifice.
Yet Christ their Savior must not be:
My Lord, men do confess thee though they do not.
This Sacrifice the Priest plots how to kill,
And yet there was
More Priest
In Christ
Then Caiaphas.
Thus types the truth, shadows would substance spil.
Innocent Lamb! although thou knew'st this plot,
Yet, Oh! how fain
Would thou get up
To be in read'ness to be slain
Against the Passover; that all might sup?
My Lord, thou see thy death but shun'st it not.
This is the Paschall Lamb, sure I may call it
Immaculate;
O God,
Thy Blood
Sprinkles my gate:
Yet is thy bitter grief my bitter sallet.
IN the upper room my Lord bespeaks the feast
For his dear Friends;
That they might know
That from above their cheer descends;
Who Will Feast with Christ must upwards go.
But, Oh! how dear for all pays this dear guest
Desiring I Have desired this feast to eat
With you, before
I go
Unto
The other shore.
Oh! how my Lord hungers to be my meat?
Yet Friends, there is something I must sadly say:
You're not all clean,
Amongst you does fit
(The man that dips with me, I mean)
A Devil, yet an Hypocrite,
That shall this night the God of truth betray.
It Is my Purse-bearers plot his Lord to sell
Who had him bought:
The wretch
To Preach
I sometime taught,
But not to sell me, or himself to Hell.
Judas! can thou find death in such a Pot?
Plot such a matter
Against thy Master?
Whilst thy sop softens in my platter,
Who of each dish make thee a taster,
Hardens thy heart the whilst, Iscariot?
Will nothing serve but sops in blood next meal?
My Purse, my dish
Were free
To thee
What more could wish?
Wretch! what thou do do quickly: Run, and sell.
Pensive Disciples when they hear, and know it,
Each fears for one:
But he that bears
The bag, is lag; perditions Son
He is the last that doubts or fears:
Slow to confess, but Oh! how swift to do it.
Come children take this bread, it is broke for you:
Much good may't do you;
It Is dressed,
And blessed,
Take it unto you,
And therewithal my broken body too.
Come my Disciples, here is an health likewise
To you, not me:
Let it go round,
Salvations cup's the cup you see:
Your health is in my bloody wound,
Think of my blood as often as ye drink this.
Your Makers broken Law, your bloody sin,
And bleeding heart
Bring me
To see
And feel this smart.
Who would Hell conquer must with death begin.
My Testament I leave you sealed in blood:
You I bequeath
When ere I die
Full conquest over sin and death
With life and peace; which by and by
I the Testatour by my death make good.
Pledge me, dear friends, this blood was broached for you
I Will drink no more
Of wine
Oth' ^ine,
Till bee'ng got ore,
I may in Fathers kingdom drink it new.
Come let us now sing, says Christ, see'ng all my sorrow
Is but your Crown:
Thorns at the breast
Make music, when the Spirit's down,
Yea sometimes music of the best;
Let Us sing to night, for I must dye to morrow.
My Lord then rises up from whence he sat
Whom winds obey,
And seas
With these,
Disciples may
Now see him, that he may be gracious, WAIT.
Sure whilst my Savior SERVES, who ever came
See'ng him so dressed,
Waiting on all
Girt with a Napkin, scarce had guest
This were the feast of's Funeral,
But Marriage Supper rather of the Lamb.
After the wine my Lord does water take;
Heaven stoops to meet,
And bow
As low
As sinners feet.
Oh what clean work Christ's Blood and Spirit makes.
Peter, thou think that I stoop down too low,
And sai'st I shall
N'ere wash thy feet;
Then can thou have no part at all
In David's Son, nor be made meet
I the new Jerusalems clean streets to go,
Streets that are pure as gold and clear as glass:
This Basin is
Thy way
I say
To this fair bliss:
Israel to Canaan must through Jordan pass.
Sirs, see you what I h've done, and do you know it?
You call me well
Say'ng I Am your Lord:
If I then stoop, Oh! never swell.
If I have washed your feet, afoard
You to do likewise: Happy if you do it.
Servants, my Livery you must wear is Love.
This bowl's my Spirit,
Which I
Now die
That you may 'nherit:
The Lamb goes hence that he may send the Dove.
Oh may this towell bind your hearts in one!
My bending down,
Teach them to bow!
May pride and sinful passions drown
In this full Basin. Men shall know
By this that your are mine when I am gone.
Gone? I Will go too, says Peter, Lord I will
What are comes on it.
Oh no!
Not so;
It Is a sore brunt.
Best metal melts when men their Maker kill.
Nay Lord, though all men run, I Will stand by thee:
Run friends or foes,
Foes to pursue,
Or friends to escape the hands of those.
Poor man I Will tell thee what is more true,
Ere the Cock crow twice I thrice denied must be.
Su^e Peter's courage strangly is come on.
My Passion, lo!
He did
Forbid,
Now he will dye too.
Yet when the shepherd dies, the sheep will run.
Let not your hearts be troubled, but believe
In God and Me.
I ride before
To see things may in red'ness be,
Behold I Will meet you at the door:
My Fathers house can me and you receive.
Whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.
Says Thomas, Nay
Lord, we
Cannot see
Which is the way,
For we, alas! know n't whither thou do go.
Thomas, I am the true and living way.
My flesh I gave,
(Know thou me)
A pathway unto Heaven to pave,
Cemented with my blood to be,
So that who walks in me cannot go astray.
Show us the Father, Lord, that is all our bliss;
Does Philip say.
How long
Among
You must I stay,
Ere you know me, says Christ, why here he is.
Judas replies, but not the Iscariot, Lord
How is it that thou
Thy self to us,
But not unto the world, do show
Thy blessed self revealing thus:
Why, I will do it to all that keep my word,
Peace I leave with you, my peace I you give,
Not as the world,
When here
And there
You're test and hurled,
The sweetest calm shall then your hearts relieve.
Friends, if you love me let me go, don't grieve me.
Oh! how your sobs
Do antedate
My Passion! O my pulse vies throbs.
Oh let my grief in yours abate;
My fathers arms are ready to receive me.
Sirs, I cannot stay to talk yonder is the Prince
The world that swaies.
O see
How he
Doth's legions raise;
Yet of one single fault cannot me convince.
I am the vine, ye branches bring forth fruit:
My blood's your sap:
My blood's your seed:
It Is well for you that others tap
The vessel, that the vine may bleed:
The hand that empties me does you recruit.
O if you love your selves let me go send
That guide to you
That shall
Even all,
Even all things show.
I h've much to speak which you cannot yet attend.
A little while I disappear, Anon
I Am seen again;
For to the Father
I go, say they, what may this mean,
This little while? we cannot gather.
Why, Friends, when Winter's over, Spring comes on.
Truth, Lord! we now believe. Ah do you so?
Just now comes on
An hour
Whose shower
Will make you run,
Whilst solitary to my grave I go.
Yet am I not alone: O blessed Father!
You Are with me still:
Now glorify
Thy Son, thy Son: when Butchers kill
Thy Lamb, Oh take me up on high
And thine and mine Lord with me, to me gathe^:
These are thy stock I kept and did improve them.
For these I pray,
And all
That shall
Their word obey.
Lord, here is thine own again; O keep them, love them!
Then his Disciples forth my Lord does lead.
Cedron in the way
Makes me bethink
What the Psalmist of the Hi^h Priest do say,
He of the brook in the way shall drink
Therefore he shortly shall lift up the head.
Thence they together to the garden pass,
Where grew that store
That can
Fallen man
Make as before:
Sure my Redeemers RVE'S that herb of grace.
'Twas in a garden Adam did undo us
There grew that fruit
Whose bitterness,
That man for ever might not rue't,
My Lord did taste and squeeze and press:
Then from a Garden brings our cure unto us.
O mount of Olives! O Gethsemane!
To all else yet
A soil
Of Oil!
Of bloody sweat
Only to me -- sinner! here is Oil for thee.
Sirs, sit you here, Peter, and James and John,
Oh! I begin
To feel such smart
Amazeth me that n'ere knew sin:
Yet how it cuts my very heart!
Sirs, sit you down. I must pray or I Am gone.
This cup, this cup, O Father! may it pass!
This cup, this cup
May't pass!
Alas!
Must I drink't up?
Why, all thy vials dregs are in this glass.
Ah! friends your heav'ness does augment mine too.
How can your eyes
Continue shut
So near such strong and bitter cries?
Dullness, I now perceive, can cut:
Will you not watch with him that is sick for you?
You three of all I chose for sentiness:
I bade you lie
^erdieu,
But you
Sleep, though I die.
Yet in weak flesh a willing spirit dwells.
But though my foot-guard sleeps, mine horse men watch
Though men do grieve me
Yet at the length
Mine Heav nly Angel does relieve me,
Heavens succors reinforce my strength.
Sin do thy worst now, thou'st meet with thy match,
Yet, Oh this cup! this cup! Lord let it pass
If It be thy will;
Yet thine
Not mine
Perform thou still.
Thy scalding wrath, Lord, cracks my brittle glass.
Sin ent'red man at first but by one hole:
But every pore
Throughout my skin,
My God! my God! becomes a door
Whence blood goes out whilst wrath comes in.
Such anger, through thine anger, melts my soul.
Can you get sleep, whilst in this scalding ba^h
I melt away,
Blood-wet
In sweat?
Sirs, think I pray,
It Is for your fevers sake of sin and wrath.
What, can I not one hours short watch obtain?
One hours? I say.
Oh! you will be tempted;
Watch, for your own sakes then, and pray:
Oh! pray that you may be exempted.
There are no vapors left in my parcht brain:
I Am past all sleeping now, but the sl^ep of death.
But, Oh! let pass
This cup!
Drink't up.
Thy sword, Alas!
In thine own fellow-shepheard do thou sheath?
Oh! how thy wrath my flower to hay converts!
My bones do stare,
My flesh consumes,
My skin is parcht, as bottles are
IN the smoke, Lord, through thine angry fumes.
Disciples, now sleep on, and rest your hearts.
This restless night of mine procures for you
A day of peace;
My showers,
Your flowers,
Your joys increase.
Never did night yield such a blessed dew:
Honey to mine, though Gall and Blood to me:
I mean those drops
Which from my brow
Bedew the ground. Sinners, what crops
May your dear Lord expect from you?
Bu^ now let us rise; you Traitor comes, I see.
Your Savior's given into sinners hands.
Judas! Ar^ come?
Thou 'lt soon
Be gone
Hence to thine home.
Whilst thou twists mine, I faster knit thy bands.
Thou send'st me to my cross: But I Will be even.
Thou shal't hang first,
Thief that thou art!
Thou'st broke thy faith, and thou shall burst
A sunder, false perfidious heart!
It Is fit such pay be to such traitors given.
Into the second Adam's garden creep
Do thou, Serpent?
That way
Betray
The innocent?
Me thinks thou smil'st as Crocodiles do weep.
Can kiss, and court me still? Hail! Master, Hail!
'Twas sometimes said,
O kiss the Son
Lest he be wroth, and strike you dead
Sure thy kiss is not such a one.
With unbelievers, Hypocrites shall wail.
Judas, thou know mine haunt. I the very place
Me to betray
Just there
Even where
With me to pray
Thy feigned lips were wont, have thou the face.
What means thy search? wretch, you are the fugitive
Your Lanthorn light,
Sirs, also shows
Your works are darkness, and you night*
Why force you what I don't refuse?
Is it my life you seek? it is that I give.
Jesus of Nazareth you're come to take;
Why I am he.
They all
Down fall.
Can majesty
Upon such Rebels such impression make?
My Lord, thou need'st nor flee, nor Peter draw?
They run, they run:
Backwards they fall:
Yet, to be taken, thou come on,
Yielding thy self unto their thrall,
Who cannot slip thy curb from off their jaw.
Servants are let go free, while the master's bound
Bold Peter now,
To show his
Prowess,
Is word and blow.
But the meek prisoner gently cures the wound.
Thou chid'st thy Champion, while thou friend'st thy foe,
Sweet Prince of peace!
The wounds of foes
Thou Would rather heal with gentleness;
Then thine should steel to flint oppose.
Peter's too hot to hold, I fear me so.
What mean your swords and staves? sirs! who is the thief:
You Have stolen the fruit,
And yet
Are set
To make pursuit.
I Have only stolen the punishment and grief.
Was I not with you in the temple still?
Have you forgot
My Sermons there?
Yet all that while ye took me not.
And must I now these shacles wear?
The Essential must the written word fulfill.
See, my Disciples leave me and they fly:
Each shifts for one:
And so
I too
Could well have done:
But, lo! my bondage is their liberty.
Thus bound they drag me to the high Priest first,
Who am the goat
Doomed thus to dye
More by Heavens counsel then their plot,
For sin, in mine Humanity;
Which though it knew no sin, for sin's accursed.
Then they confess over my guiltless head
Their sins, not mine:
Yet I
Did cry,
Something divine
You Will find has escaped your hands when I am dead.
In my two natures I Am both Goats in one:
Can dye, yet escape;
Can escape, yet dye:
I can discharge first Adams rape,
Then second Adams bands unty.
Sinner, I must do both, or you are undone.
False witness they suborne amongst faithless Jews.
Such is their grudge
Their Lord
They 'ccord
To death to adjudge.
Though witnesses agree not, that accuse.
Art thou the Christ? they captiously enquire.
Not for to know
As sometime did
John's dear Disciples, but to throw
Mine own confessions at mine head.
They watch my words with an enflamed desire:
This Mary sometimes did, but not as they;
Not life, but death
They watch
And catch
From my dear breath,
Both to themselves and me this bloody day.
Peter steals to their fire, to melt, not fight:
Mine seldom warm
Themselves with such
But quickly rue their dear-bought harm,
Saying the warmth's not half so much.
Sirs, is it so this morn? 'twas hot in the night;
I felt it so. Nor find I ought yet cool,
Except it be
The love
Even of
My friends to me,
Whilst enemies my wisdom fain would fool.
The High Priest rends his clothes but not his heart
Then all condemn me
The Hall throughout,
Who must judge all: Abjects contemn me,
Whom Angels do admire, they flout.
They are the Ishma'ls, I bear Isaacks part.
Then they blindfold mine eyes, to whom the night
Shines as the day:
I cannot,
Sure, want,
Who gave away
So many eyes to others wanting sight.
Oh! how these Bats project to blind the Sun!
Moles plot and think
(How wise they are?)
With a poor clout thus to hood-wink
Jacobs true bright and morning star.
Indeed if it could, you have need it should be done.
How they to make me like themselves devise?
I, and they, wink:
They see
Not me;
And so they think
I cannot see them, although I made their eyes.
Others, for spite, spit on my blessed face,
Which Moses, and
Elias too,
Did once in the mount admiring stand
Transfigur'd then, disfigured now.
How men bespatter Gods own looking-glass.
These pot sheards then their potter smite with rods.
My white and ruddy
These foes
With blows
Make black and bloody:
I Am box'd by slaves, who rule among the Gods.
Then prophecy who smote thee, some do cry.
Alas! who not?
Yet I Will impart;
Me, for my seed, my Father smote;
But never did mine own clean heart.
Scorners, go read Isaiah's Prophecy.
He did esteem me stricken of my God;
That stripes on me,
My smart
Of heart,
Man's cure might be:
Man did the fault, and I must feel the rod.
Peter, I doubt thy courage will soon cool
At that same fire;
The Ague'll come on:
Satan to sift thee did desire.
Now Peter prove thee rock and stone.
My dear Disciple, do n't deny my school.
Oh! at first charge, I see, my Champion's laid!
The shield, the shield
Of faith
He has
Near lost this shield.
Who played the man amongst men, falls by a maid.
Whom flesh and blood revealed not, flesh and blood
Can teach deny,
Even his dear Lord;
Constant to's own unconstancy.
Even as if this had been his word,
I will deny, not dye, to this he stood.
Oh! my poor fisher's caught the second time.
I said, abide
In me,
O ye
Will quickly slide:
But now it seems to b^ of me's a crime.
Then others cry, this man's of Nazareth.
He by and by
With cu sing does
Me, tha^ have born his curse, deny:
(...) e^rs (...) ^now^ not what he know'th
Peter, they say they smell thee by thy breath
To be of me, Oh! that I could so say!
Sirs, don't you hear?
The man
Can ban,
Can curse and swear.
That he is of me, Sirs, does such speech bewray?
Surely you know my speech no more then me.
Peter denies
His Christ -- so crew
The Bird that wakes the sleepers eyes;
I looked on Peter, then he knew
The Cock his Masters Monitour to be.
Peter thus finding all crow over him
Runs forth to weep;
His soul
Now foul
To wrinse and steep;
Even in a spring-ride of salt tears to swim.
I have denied my Lord, my Lord that is dying:
I have denied
My Lord, my Lord
Whom I confessed, professed; bee'ng tried
I have renounced his and my word;
My Lord that bought me I have been denying.
Now his hot fit's come on. My Christ, when ever,
Through thou know what,
Thee I
Deny
In word or thought;
Oh! give me Peter's sweat, in Peter's fever.
By this time is my dooms days dawning come.
Their rightful King
Jews having bound
Before an alien Judge do bring.
That guilt in the guiltless might be found,
Butchers object, but I the Lamb, lie dumb.
Herod, and Pontius Pilate, Gentiles, Jews
Counsel and plot:
I am
The Lamb
Must go to pot:
Satan is at mine heel, which he will bruise.
Who art? and, what is truth? Pilate enquires,
Bee'ng strange to both,
I find it so:
Yet to my blood shed lag and loath,
Whilst mine own people raging go
To burn King David's branch with Gentile fires.
Take him your selves, says Pilate; Jewish men,
Ease your own grudge.
Say they
We may
No man adjudge
To death. Our Scepter's gone. Where Is Shiloh then?
See you your wants? not what ye have, O ye?
Why, Shiloh's come:
My white and ruddy
This wine and milk, though I be dumb
Speaks it; this innocence thus bloody.
This is your Shiloh's garment: cannot you see?
It Is not so long, O thou my city! since
Hosannahs, cried
In thee
To me,
Me testified;
Thy people gathering round about their Prince
It Is not so long since I did bind my fool,
Mine Asses Colt,
Unto my vine;
To thee, Jerus'lem, now revolt;
That I might wash my weeds in wine,
Whilst to the death I Am pouring out my soul.
Judas meanwhile, consid'ring all that is done
Through his foul sin,
Relents
Repents
And brings again
That dunghill dirt for which he sold the Sun.
For's thirty pieces, thirty thousand woes
Oppress his heart.
Then to his Priest,
I Have sinned, and the innocent must smart.
The wretch bee'ng shriven, so confessed.
See thou to that, say the Priests, see thou to those.
Oh! to what lead does ill-got silver turn?
Judas cannot bear
The weight
Of it;
Yet 'twas his dear:
Oh! take it again. My fingers burn, they burn.
Into the treas'ry this they dare not cast:
Oh! it is not good,
Poor men they dare not;
Oh! it is the price, the price of blood!
And yet to spill that blood they spare not:
Thus Gnats do stick, whilst Camels go down fast.
They take the money first, and then dispute
Wheth'r 't should be so.
Mean while
The vile
Traitor does go,
Bee'ng self-condemned himself to execute.
A bloody piece of Charitie's the end.
The Potters field,
That strangers might
Be buried there, to buy they yield
Not burying there their own strange spite.
Thus kind to strangers, whilst they kill their friend.
Mean while me at a godly price men hold;
Hereto it is come,
One field
Can yield
As great a sum,
As does the Maker of the world when sold.
Now the Judge of all stands bound at Pilats bar.
Great God is tried
For's life, by man:
Yet by this stranger justified,
Say mine own people what they can.
Hurried to Her^d next, and's men of war.
Herod forsooth would see a miracle
And does, whilst I
Sustain
Disdain
So patiently,
Who could scoule these proud scorners quick to Hell.
In white and splendid raiment then, from thence
I Am re-convey'd
To my first judge.
('Twixt whom and Herod peace is made
They in my blood can sink their grudge)
Wearing the type of my clear innocence
Says Pilate, see nor I nor Herod can
His crime discry
Why he
Should be
Condemned to dye;
Will you, this feast, that I release this man?
Take him, and scourge him, scourge him as you list,
Oh! What I feel!
My God, what lashes!
Think you my back is stone or steel
Like your hard hearts? O gage these gashes?
And spare your rod, or tell me wherefore is it.
Yet does mine hand still sway that iron-rod,
Wherewith I can
All those
My foes,
Even as one man,
In pieces break; and make them know I Am God.
Who would have thought all government were laid
Upon these shoulders,
Thus rent and torn
By cruel stripes? yet they are the upholders
Whereon both globes oth' world are born;
A load that is light to th'stripes of them that strai'd.
I am the fruitful field now plowed in furrows,
That every sin
Might have
Its grave
To wither in.
I am the rock, these holes are sinners burrows.
Princes, whilst under Paedagogues they be,
Can stand and see,
When they have transgrest,
Sub^ects whipped for it, why, Pilate me,
Thou'st innocent and king confessed,
Yet for my peoples faults I Am scourged by thee.
Pilate, thou think these bloody stripes may cease
Their bloody cry,
But blood
'So good,
They Will drink them dry,
And their Hydropick thirst will more increase.
Alas! thou think to seal me a release
From blood in gore,
But 'twill not be
Till I have emptied all my store.
Then, sinner, there is release for thee.
So dearly must I buy my Subjects peace.
Pilates own wife becomes mine advocate:
Her sufferings in
Her dream,
To them
She does begin,
So to prevent my Passion, to relate.
But who can harden his soft cowardice.
To take my part,
And shield my right?
Or molifie their hardened heart
To quit their spleen, or scirrhous spite?
Pilate, have naught to do with Christ, she cries:
Woman, thy husband's like to 've nothing sure
With me to do:
Whilst he
For me
No heart can show;
But to condemn, whom he acquits, endure.
Pilates own Lady plays the nursing mother;
Whilst Jews reject,
Builders refuse
Fair Sions precious stone elect
Which for the corner God will use.
'Ware Pilate lest this crowd thy conscience smother.
Pilate and I have two hard parts to play;
Pilate, to please
All those
My foes,
Yet me release:
I, to make Heaven and earth good friends this day.
Time after time he questions and approves
Mine innocence;
And tells the Jews
That clearly that is all mine offense:
And does the oil of courtship use,
Which either more enflames, or nothing moves.
Pilate hangs first 'twixt two bee'ng crucified,
Conscience and fear:
The Rout
Without
For blood appear:
By Pilates Privy Counsel it is denied.
Will you, says Pilate, I release your King,
Or Barrabas
The Murderer?
The Man of Men the Monster was
Yet Barrabas they all prefer
Blood upon blood thus on themselves they bring.
Now, O ye Heavens, stand astonished!
And thou, bright Sun,
Be gone:
Get on
Thy mourning gown!
That when I bow mine, thou may hide thinehead.
Let Gad'rens now for kind commended be;
Yet they preferred
Their herd of swine,
But no Barabbas in that Herd.
But, Oh! the hoggishness of mine,
Even of mine only people unto me!
Why even these Butcher's trade's a mystery.
There is a skill
That they
This day
Have learnt to fill
Their hands with blood: and that before I dye.
The murder and the murderer all is their own
Whilst they thus choose:
And oh! what wonder?
What fitter head, for bloody Jews,
Than this Barabbas, to list under;
Whilst from their head they cast off me their crown?
My Christ, there is yet a sweeter mystery:
Innocent breath
I see
In thee
Condemned to death;
That the chief of sinners might escape thereby.
What shall I do then with your King, says he.
Him Crucify,
Cries all the rout:
Oh let him, let him, let him dye!
As if they could not live without
His blood, no more can I Lord, give it me.
Why, but says Pilate, tell me what is his crime,
Or take him you.
Away,
Say they,
Let him dye now.
To find his fault would ask too long a time,
Whilst all can tell me how, none can tell why
I should be killed.
Sirs, is 't because
I gave you good and righteous Laws
Which you have broke, and I fulfilled?
Must I because I let you live, now dye?
Or is it for some injuries of old!
In Egypt, and
In the
Red Sea,
And desert Land,
Whereof your Fathers Fathers have you told?
Or is it because I said I came from God
To bring a new
And great Salvation,
Greater then the first, to thee, O Jew!
Proving my mission to my Nation,
By an all-conquering wonder-working Rod?
Is it because your dumb can speak, that I Am
Cried out against?
Against me
Are ye,
O Jews! incenst
Because of all my cures? are they my crime?
Is it because your dead are raised, that I
Am grudged my breath?
Grudged what I give?
Am I therefore condemned to death?
Dos't therefore grieve you that I live?
Why, I shall quicken the more, when ere I dye.
Then Pilate puts me in the soldiers hands:
They plat a Crown:
Alas!
It was
A thorny one
Which he must wear, who Heaven and Earth commands.
Why, I am Isra'ls King: and him I found
In The Wilderness,
That howling waste,
Whose Music these outcries express;
Whose only fruits are thorns, I taste:
Clothed with their sins I Am with their thorns too crowned.
Thus I with sinners change, it is well for them:
Their thorney Crown
So worn,
And born,
I make mine own,
Yielding for it an heavenly diadem.
Israel, that so long brought me no sweet Cane,
Now puts me off
With a poor weed:
For sacrifice, they bring a scoff:
And for my scepter, bring a reed;
Yet by me Princes rule and Kings do reign.
Then in Purple Robe they me invest:
But that same color
I wore
Before,
Through stripes and dolor,
Both on my scourged back and tortured breast.
Then gathering round, even as they lift, they flout me.
Hail King! they cry;
And bow the knee,
But not their hearts: (Why, truly I
Ever had some that so serve me)
Breathing disdain yet cannot they breath without me.
They rend my flesh, the temples of mine Head
They smite with reeds:
But I
Surely
Shall quit their deeds,
By rending veil and Temple when I Am dead.
In strange disguise (for so are Princes wont
When as they pass
Through strangers lands,
And such Judea is, alas!
To me, whilst I am in such hands:)
Brought forth I am that Priests might me confront
A ruthful spectacle! a man of grief!
Laden with woes!
With thorns;
With scorns
Of bitter foes!
Will not the Priest and Levite yield relief?
Whither, oh! whither, would I, could I fly?
Shall I repair
To the Alters side?
Spite is there hottest. There they are
That first cried, be he Crucified.
Away, say they, O let him, let him die.
We have a Law, the Son of Death he is
Gods Son to be
That makes
Or takes,
Himself here is he.
Sirs do not quote the Second Psalm for this.
Pilate an Heathen, dreads my reverend name,
Which Jews despise:
Enquires the more
Whence I am? whence my kingdom is?
Not of this world, I h'd said before:
So, he my dumbness, I his deafness blame.
Of what he asks I did the truth impart,
And told him so:
But he
'Gan flee
The truth as though
It were some Ghost or Mormo Truth! what art?
With His power of life and death he then does brave me,
Who hold the keys
Of David still
To shut and open as I please,
To bind and loose all as I will,
For such Command'ment God my Father gave me:
Yet Pilates Conscience in his face still flies:
Now he projects
How me
To free;
But all the effects
TO inflame their fury, double their outcries.
Yet in their anger so much wit they have
As to compound
Some thing to calm
Poor Pilates Conscience, why, they have found
Some simples sovereign as balm;
Oh! 'twas good satisfaction that they gave.
Thou art not Cesars friend if this man go.
Now take your Christ,
Fulfill
Your will,
Do what you list
With him, Jews, so I sentence, and so do.
Thus he and I swim down one stream this day.
Yet the poor man
Found want of water,
Called for a Basin, and began
To wash him from this bloody matter:
Which nothing can, but what he gav^ away.
Truly his washing clears not him, but me:
He does proclaim,
That I
Now die
A spotless Lamb:
Then, wretch, what Ocean can compurgate thee?
Pilate, upon us and our children fling
Thou this man's blood:
We Jews, thus wish.
Is this your so much longed for food,
To you of all the forbidden dish?
Pilate then cries, ye Jews, behold your King.
We have no King but Caesar, they reply.
Sirs, you forget
Whose hour
Of power
This is as yet.
Satan's your Caesar, more then he or I.
Satan, not Caesar, bad you plot my fall:
That Prince of Hell,
Philistia's King
Plows with mine heifer, Israel:
Thu^ to mine end, mine own me bring.
Yet Sampsons death's Philistia's Funeral.
The Purple Robe then strip they from my back;
Which plainly shows
It Is worn
And born
For sinners use,
That of my Righteousness they might partake.
Thus is the truth stripped naked: And again
My seamless coat
They make me wear
Unto mine execution-plot,
That by my sweet atonement there
I might an Union weave 'twixt God and Men,
Thence to the place of Souls, Lo! I their Head
The tree accursed,
Before
It bore
Me, bear it first;
Till I, by bearing it, am almost dead.
Thus mine may learn in me, what burden he
Must daily bear,
Taking his cross,
That in my ways will persevere,
Reckoning death gain, counting life loss:
Who stumbles at my cross, cannot follow me.
Now are my groans new pickled in friends tears,
They Would steal, I spy,
This tree
From me,
By Sympathy;
Which by constraint Simon of Cyrene bears.
But weep not, Daughters of Jerusalem!
For me at all
But for your City:
Alas! who can prevent thy fall,
Who show thy builder no more pity?
If they do thus to the green tree, woe to them!
T^us under Pilates sentence, and command
O the Roman state,
That all
May fall
On Romes proud Pate;
I the place of Crucifixion, lo! I stand.
Rome! you are that Sodom, Egypt, Babylon,
Though Mystical;
Drunken with blood
Of all my Martyrs, mine withal
Now mingling with thy ^ybers flood.
Rome's stored with crosses and now lends me one!
Not Jabbathah but Golgotha's the stage
The Camp without;
Where I
Must dye
Amongst all the rout,
Tasting at once both Hells and Heavens Rage.
Why I am the great Sacrifice for sin,
And therefore must
Without the gate
Unto the Earth commend my dust,
Whilst my dear blood does expiate
From all transgressions that those are within.
Behold, my dear Disciple, my dear Mother!
Her I bequeath
To thee,
To be
After my death
Provided for as by her Son, my Brother.
Now see your Brazen Serpent lift, on high,
Upon the pole!
My bloody cross
Bears fruit to quit what Adam stole:
Justice, I find, may n't go by the loss,
Yet grace shall reign by righteousness, hereby.
Oh! how I Am stretched and tortured on this tree!
Oh! how each vein,
And nerve
Does serve
A several pain!
'Twas man grew loose, and I must straightened be.
Oh! how those hands, I stretched forth all the day,
To Israel,
Are stretched again?
That as my Patience did excel,
So now I might exceed in pain;
Whilst sinners to mine heart find open way.
Oh! how my feet, that nere took step awry,
Are pierced through!
Made fast
In have
My cross unto;
Till the transgressors may find time to fly.
I am the door, they nail me to the tree:
And, as is fit,
Over this gate
A royal superscription's writ
That in all tongues might preach my state.
Oh! all ye that pass by, turn in by me.
To the cross I Am hing'd in mine humanity.
That from the floor
Even each
Might reach
That living door
Whose upper hinge clasps in with th'Deity.
Romans, and Greeks, and Hebrews, come and look:
These open arms
Show the open way,
How by mine, you may case your harms;
And may become one fold this day:
I am the shepherd, and my cross the crook.
I am the shepherd, and my crook, the cross;
Whereby I gather
And keep
My sheep,
And thine, O Father!
I Will suffer death, ere thou shall suffer loss.
Living, my bread of life among my Jews
I ever brake,
For 'twas their right;
Who whilst they spread these arms, do make
A feast for Gentiles through their spite;
That, dying, I might none, that come, refuse.
Come unto me all ye that laden be
With sin and wrath;
Come ye
To me;
O come in faith.
I Will bear your burdens whilst my Cross bears me.
Mine hands are not so nailed, but that I can
Even with these nails
Still pick the lock
Hung on your heel, if your key fails:
But whilst I preach, alas! they mock.
If thou be th'Christ be thine own Jesus, man.
Why Jews remember what your high Priest taught
How needful 'twas
That I
Should dye,
That th'cup might pass
My people, whilst I drink their bloody draught.
But, oh Jerusalem! can laugh at me?
And at my griefs?
As thou did know
My pressures to be thy reliefs;
Repent, believe; and be it so.
But laugh not at me who h've wept over thee,
And yet weep blood, for this thy stupid state.
Father, I pray
Reprieve,
Forgive
These foes for they
Alas! my God, they do they know not what.
They curse, I bless: I pray whilst they revile.
Whilst Priests do scoff
And sore disdain
The Sacrifice that comes not off
The Altar, but suffers to be slain,
My blood makes intercession all the while.
Who'd raze then raise the Temple (this is he)
In three days space;
Yet he,
We see,
Cannot quit this place
Where all the nails that hold him, are but three
Yet mock not, passenger; wag not thine head
In so much scorn,
When thou think least,
When I this bitter death have borne,
To earnest I'^ soon turn thy jest;
And raise this Temple ere't be three days dead,
Come down say some, and so convince thy foes:
Which if I should
How sore
A store
Of wrath, and blood,
Would come down too? Sirs, I bear of your blows.
With the transgressors numbered am I:
On either side,
Truth bee'ng between,
Falsehood and theft hang crucified;
Yet if Heavens Rolls these men had seen
They Would found me in another Trinity.
But, oh my grief! not only mine own Nation
But those, that be
Justly
To dye,
First scoff at me;
Their partner not in crimes, but condemnation.
Yet can I not forget my dear Compassions:
Though both reproach
And flout at me,
My blood for sinners since I broach,
I will not suffer both to be
At once partakers of two condemnations
The one I call home though in the eleventh hour:
And thereby show
How kind
A mind
I bear to you
That turn, though late, to me your Savior.
But oh his rare Conversion! oh how he
Justifies God!
Rebukes his mate!
Open his sin! kisseth his rod!
Takes me for Lord, beseeching that
In my Salvation he might sharer be.
Thus on my Cross I work a new Creation:
Loosing the bands
Of sin
Within
From the sinners hands.
My bitter sacrifice brings sweet salvation.
Thus I give life to others, yet I dye;
I heal their wounds,
And break their bands;
Yet anguish mine own soul confounds
More then these nails do pierce mine hands
My God! why do thou me forsake? Oh! why?
They rend my garments, cast lots for my coat,
Whilst I hang here;
Shame does
Me cloth,
Else naked I were
Yonder Is thy Joseph's coat, Lord! do not know it?
The seamless vesture of thy sinless child,
How bloody is it?
My God! My God!
Yet not so bloody as thy Christ
Is all within by thy sharp rod.
O be not fierce to me, for I am mild.
See, how I Am nailed to this most bitter tree!
How I Am accursed!
How gall
Is all
My drink in thirst!
And will thou so, my God, my God! leave me?
See, how men turn my Glory into shame.
Mocking my faith
And confidence;
Some say he for Elias pray'th:
But, Lord, thou know my mind and sense.
They flout, they fleet, whilst I call on thy name.
Yet save me, for I Am thine: thine handmaids son
Made of this woman:
Thy shade
This maid,
When known by no man,
Impow'rd to bring forth me, thine holy one.
Father! I Am the only fatherless on earth:
All others have
Fathers, or had:
O pity, pity, Lord! and save
Thy Fatherless, support the sad.
Oh! leave me not in death, who gav'st me birth.
My God! my God! why do thou me forsake?
Who never thee
Forsook,
Or took
One sin to me,
Except the sins that thou did bid me take.
They fill the sponge with vinegar, but thou
My soul do fill
With sharper grief.
Oh! sinner, here is a bitter pill,
Yet for thy sickness sweet relief.
My God! my God! O do not leave me now!
How darkness vailes the land! yet clouds do hover
Darker by far:
Thy wrath
Lord, has
Eclyps'd thy star,
Whilst from thy darling thou thy face do cover.
How both Suns suffer while thy Son lies under
Thy fierce displeasure!
The Sun bears a part
But mine eclypse it cannot measure.
Lord thy sore frowns do tear my heart
More then the Temples veil, that is rent asunder.
Now come thy breaches and thy darkness on,
O Jewish Land!
For thou
Have now
Both rid thine hand
Of thy bright light and of thy Cornerstone.
Father, the earth's all ague, and I more:
Even rocks are rent,
My soul's more torn:
Yet flinty Jews don't once relent.
My God: leave not mine hope forlone.
I h've done. Lord, open the everlasting Door.
Father, into thine hands I give my Spirit,
And utmost breath;
Whilst I
Thus dye;
And, with me, death:
That my dear seed henceforth may life inherit.
Then Christ, in sweet submission, bows his head
To all Gods pleasure:
I think on it still:
Lord make the bowing heart my treasure
An heart to bow to all thy will;
That dying I may say, all is finished.
This done, my Savior quickly shows his force
Graves open fly;
They shake
And quake
That see him die:
The rude Centurion's struck with strange remorse.
Thus Christ lets loose his prisoners, captivates
His scornful foes;
They knock their breast,
Confessing whom they did oppose
To be Gods SON, now not in jest.
Thus Sampsons death brake the Phylistians pates.
Then with a spear his side a Soldier strikes;
Cleaving the Rock
That may
Each day
Water that Flock,
Whose Shepherd is now past all push of pikes.
This is the fountain opened for thy sin,
Jerusalem!
Thy filth, thy guilt;
Here is for each a proper stream,
Water and Blood: Let none be spilt:
O quench thy guilt, and cleanse thy filth herein.
Israel thy Paschall Lamb, thy Christ is dead,
That Lamb from Heaven:
Have care,
Prepare,
Purge out thy Leaven:
Mingle no more thy malice with thy bread.
Or if the Jewish lump will not leave their leaven
Make me leave mine:
I have in me
(Lord, nail it to this Cross of thine)
An evil heart of enmity.
Lord kill this enmity 'twixt Earth and Heaven.
Be thou my fort, and hiding place, my soul
Would lodge in thee:
My Lord
Affoard
One cleft for me.
Thy walls are shatt'red, yet you are timber-whole.
Satan and sin I h've seen, in the Tragic story,
Shoot through and through
Thy blessed heart;
Yet not one bone was broken, though
Mount Sinai's Cannons played their part.
In this rock hide me, till I h've seen thy Glory.
Shall not Christ Crucified far dearer be
To me then Pelf,
Then name
Or fame
Or life it self?
'Twas thus with Joseph, why not thus with me?
The Soldiers having broke the others legs,
But not my Lords;
Joseph, a man
Rich in the goods this world affoards
But more in faith, most boldly ran
To Pilate, and Christ's lifeless body beggs.
Then in clean linen wraps that skin and bones,
That martir'd treasure:
And why
Cannot I
Take as much pleasure
To cloth thy members, Lord, thy naked ones?
Jews, now ou^ king's come down: Sirs do you see him?
Your Temple lies
Flat by the ground:
Will you believe when it does arise?
Catching your Christ at his rebound?
Why if his own will not have him, Lord! give me him.
Christ having now given death his deadly wound,
Follows him home:
Invades
Deaths shades,
Enters a tomb,
To see what spoils may in a grave be found.
Great Conqueror, who have killed death in the duel
After this art
Lodged in a stone?
Rather take up in my poor heart
How hard soever, or how none.
Oh! that I were thy Cabinet, dear jewel?
But Joseph's rock was pure, that grave was new:
First in a womb,
Which none
Had known;
Then in a tomb
Where none had lain, my Lord log'd, this does show,
I must be clean and new first. Yet thy passion
And stream of blood,
What did it mean,
That Purple yet a Christ all flood?
Was It not the making of me clean?
Does not thy rising mean my renovation?
Then make and take for such this heart of mine
And dwell in it:
This breast
Is best
That I can get,
Had I a better, Lord, it should be thine.
Surely the King of terror I could brave,
If my Lord would
This Sepulcher,
This heart, as his own quarters hold;
I would nor goal nor jailer fear.
Oh how my Saviors Corpse perfume the grave!
Lord, make this heart of mine a living one
Through thy deaths merit
Convey
I pray
To me thy spirit,
Who thy dead flesh did Coffin in dead stone.
With the Arimathean Counselor combined
A learned Rabbi
To show Christ kindness;
An Israelitish Doctor: may be
Some wiser man will blame my blindness,
And Antichrist in Law and Learning find.
But may my soul with blessed Joseph dwell
And Nicodem:
Yet, down
With the Gown,
Cry some of them
Who scarce I doubt from these can bear the Bell.
A spicie mixture, 'bout an hundred pounds,
Who came by night
To Jesus brings
TO embalme his Lord, that gave him light,
With Aromatic precious things:
Y^^ not one half so precious as those wounds.
Now Jesus ( Jonah-like) Heavens sealed one,
Enters the deep:
But shall
The Whale,
The grave, him keep?
See, Soldiers watch, and Pilate seals the stone.
As Daniel's sealed when cast into the Den,
Malicious Jews
Require a seal,
And watch, which Pilate will not refuse,
Left some the Coffined Corpse should steal.
They Will keep the Sun from rising; Crafty men!
Lo! in a Garden stood the sealed Tomb.
Adam the first
Hav'ng bin
For sin
In The Garden cursed
To the Grave. My Savior thus fullfills the doom.
Then dawns that blessed light that ever since
Makes one day shine
More then six other;
For should six weekday lights combine,
One Lord's Day brightness would then smother
With thee, Thy Day Lord rises and proves Prince
That Day is now obscured wherein Christ slept;
That Day's made bright
In which
That rich
And orient light
Quit that blind prison where he had been kept.
Surely that day's the whole weeks Jubilee
(That day's the best
Which my dear Lord
By ceasing from his labor blessed,
Labor that cost more then a word)
Wherein redemption set the ransomed free.
This first day finds more then the seventh day lost
Can supe^add
And raise
More praise
Then the other had:
So the old Commandment is fullfill'd, not crossed:
That bids me celebrate what day of seven
God has most blessed;
And HIS, does call:
Such WAS the Jewish, IS our rest.
We sowr'd Gods first works by our fall,
Till Christ's last Passover purged out the leaven
Was not Christ's Burial part of 's Humiliation?
His day of rest
From that
Dark state
Shall't not be blessed?
Shall I less prize a new then old Creation?
Redemption is a making old things new.
Rouse Christians then:
Though dead before,
Let Lords-Dayes find you living men;
That with your Christ can rise and soar.
And for the Christian, quit thy Sabbath, Jew.
The first in sin runs first to the Sepulcher
Poor woman kind:
But Christ
Is mist:
Oh! they cannot find
Their Lord; though two of his Life guard appear,
The two bright pointers of that blessed Star
His countenance,
Who h'd rolled the stone,
Strikes keepers hearts, at's first advance,
As dead as what he sat upon.
Thieves were, now Angels Christ's attendants are.
Say the women who shall roll the stone away?
'Twas done before.
Thus may,
I pray,
I find my score
Quit to mine hand, when I cry who shall pay?
Surely my surety did my debt discharge:
Lord, else why should
Thine Angel be
Sent down to unlock that prison-hold
Wherein my Savior lay for me?
My surety's free, why may not I walk at large?
They would with Ointments, Odours, precious things
Perfume his Prison:
But the dead
Was fled;
Their Sun was risen
With sweeter balm with healing in his wings.
Mary the sinner, Mary Magdalen
Marches in the van
To the Sepulcher,
But the stone's removed, and so's the man:
She missing her dear Savior there,
To John and Peter runs, and comes again.
These run a race, the wager's precious truth.
But John outran:
Alas
He was
The younger man.
Happy the man runs after Christ in youth.
Peter, successor to his Masters Cross,
Whilst John keeps out
Enters Christ's Tomb;
Looks for his Christ but finds a clout,
And winding sheet in Saviors Room:
But Christ is gone. O blessed, gainful loss!
Mary the old weeper stands without and cries;
But stooping down,
Spies here
And there
The Grave clothes thrown,
Which linnens scarce can serve to wipe her eyes,
She is still anxious, turns her round, and lo
There the Gardener stood,
As she conceived,
Even he that waters with his blood
Each plant of his. Thus Christ's received
By the true seeker often when it thinks not so.
Sir, if thou have borne him hence (and 'twas well guest)
Tell me, says she:
Mary!
Lo I
Even I am he.
Ah! my dear Lord, that word revives my heart.
Yet touch me not, says he, I Am not ascended:
But go thou rather
And tell abroad
Unto my Brethren, to my Father
And yours I go, mine and your God.
So richly is the poorest Saint befriended!
How studious is my Lord that they should know,
And so partake
Of this
His Bliss
That did forsake
Him in his captive state and sufferings so.
Surely these men that fled then from their colors,
Might have expected
Another kind
Of message should have been directed
From their now rising Lord: but find
Their sins in his Grave buried with his dolours.
No word of the old uncomfortable story.
But say I Am risen:
Let tears
And fears
Take up my prison.
Run tell my Brethren thou have seen my Glory:
Also the Angel cries, be not afraid:
Jesus you would have:
I know it well:
But think you David in a cave,
Or David's Son must ever dwell?
Come see the place where your dear Lord was laid.
Women, your Lord's not here; your Lord is risen
Have you forgot
Your Lords
Own words?
Or have you not?
Seek you the Prince of life in this dead prison?
Run, tell the rest and Peter, Christ is gone
Toward Galilee
As he did say.
With joy and fear away they flee
All dapled like the time of day
And as they march, behold! they see the SON.
O may my Lord thus evermore appear,
And shine upon
Poor me,
When he
Says, get thee gone,
And unto others, of me, tidings bear.
Oh blessed meeting! Courtship, and devotion!
All Hail! says he:
They bow to his feet;
Light that forbids us courteous be
Was then so dark Christ could not see it.
That master taught his scholars no such notion.
Men, it is observed the rising sun adore;
Christ's risen now:
And bright
Day light
Beams from his brow;
Shall not all worship the Son of God much more?
The watch mean while bring news of all that is done.
To the Priests within,
Even that Christ's risen;
Who seeing him past reach, begin
To plot how they this truth m' imprison.
Christ's second Gravestone is a silver one.
What potent pranks can mighty Mammon show!
Powerful pelf
In'ts facts
Out acts
Even power it self:
Money can make truth falsehood, falsehood true.
Money betrayed my Lord to all these wrongs:
Now they are devising
To keep on foot
Something to cloud this bright Suns-rising;
And it is large money that must do it.
This silver key must turn the soldiers tongues.
Soldiers are taught a sorry tale to tell;
Which should methinks
Nere slip
Their lip;
But that which chinks
So sweetly, can make all sound pretty well.
Say, Whilst we keepers slept at the Sepulcher,
's Disciples came
And stole him thence;
Which if the governor shall blame
We'll mediate and make your defense.
Now hear O Heavens! and O Earth! give ear.
Can thus, O Isr'ell, fool away thy Glory?
Is such a wise
Fable
Able
To blind thine eyes?
Is this the authentic, yet received story?
Why, soldiers, if you slept at the Sepulcher
Whilst that vast stone
Was rolling back
(Which may a Jew believe, or none)
And some by stealth the corpse did take;
I marvel you could see what men they were.
Or if you saw the thieves, why did you not
Stop or pursue?
So short
Report
Want so much give?
See how the last words have the first forgot.
But oh fond Priests and Elders whence is it
That you can stroke
These soldiers pates?
Sure such neglect would you provoke
Of all. Yet you're their advocates.
Alas! how fury does befoole their wits!
Mean while Disciples were so far from thieving
That, when this news
They btought
That saw't,
Yet, they refuse
To take it for truth, being so far from believing.
As two of them were to Emaus going
Their busy tongue
Bee'ng well employed,
My dearest Lord stands them among;
No sooner talked of, then enjoyed.
Happy the Servants whom he finds so doing.
What is your talk that makes your walk so sad?
Says Cleopas
Do thou
Not know
These things? Alas!
A mighty Man and Prophet we have had;
Mighty in word and deed with God and Men:
Jesus was he
Of Nazareth
We'd hoped might our Redeemer be:
But him, our Rulers put to death
This bee'ng the third day since. And yet again
We know not what to think on it, hurried
'Twixt hope and fear;
For some,
That come
From the Sepulcher,
Assure us that he is risen from the Dead.
But oh this evil heart of unbelief!
This want of faith
That can provoke
The gentle Lamb of God to wrath,
Setting in every wheel a spoke,
Clouding the rising Sun with gloomy grief!
O fools, and slow of heart replies my Lord
Slow to believe me!
But oh
Not so
Not slow to grieve me,
Ought not your Christ fulfill the written word?
But Christ cannot always hold his chiding story:
Sugars his checks
With sweet instructions;
Moses his veil in pieces breaks;
Proves by prophetic fair deductions,
Through Seas of sufferings Christ must land in Glory.
My Lord then makes as he would further go:
But they begin
so pray
Him stay,
And he turns in:
Happy, who love their close reprovers so.
This bread of life thus broken when he had,
He breaks more bread
And makes them eat:
Their Lord's their Shepherd, they are well fed,
Body and Soul, with blessed meat.
My soul, seek Christ first; and those things he will add.
Just now my Lord makes them see who he is,
Then slips away.
And, oh!
'Twas so
With me last day,
One moment opened and sealed up like bliss.
When Christ was gone, say they we might have guest
What light 'twas brought
So bright a day
To darkest Scriptures: might have thought
The risen Sun was in our way
Finding our hearts so burn within our breast.
Then they return back to Jerusalem
Brimfull of joy
To feast
The rest;
But they are coy
Till Christ Himself stands in the midst of them.
And it is so still. Whoever's sent about
To tell thy story,
Hardness of hearts
And unbelief blinds all thy glory:
Lord, who believes? Lord, who converts?
Till thy dear presence puts all out of doubt.
Their doors bee'ng shut, and hearts much more, that even
My Lord to put
All out
Of doubt;
(None else can do it)
This news imparts in person to the eleven.
Yet oh how hard a thing is this believing?
A sprite appears
As they suppose;
The same that in their storms of fears
Walked on the Seas when winds arose.
Phant'sies fooles-bolt, how't hinders truths receiving.
Jesus salutes them with a peace be to you
Once and again:
It Is I;
Sirs, why
Distrust you then?
Why do you let such thoughts arise, why do you?
Down doubtings; I Am got up: And ready have
(Sirs, come and see
And feel, I pray)
A Tomb, dead unbelief, for thee
Dig'd in my side but the other day,
And for your doubtings, in each hand a grave.
If these suffice not, handle, feel my feet
There are two more.
Doubt not,
I Have got
All as before:
Rather then miss their faith their sense he will meet.
Then for the further feeding of their faith
He calls for food;
They give him fish,
And Honey-Combe: but, oh! his blood
And body is a sweeter dish.
Then, breathing, take the Holy Ghost, he says.
Now does the frost-nipt Tree of life recover:
Puts forth again:
New springs,
And brings
Fruits that remain
Spirit and Life, so prove's Deaths Winter's over
Thomas mean while bee'ng absent from the rest
Freezing from the fire,
(Like them that miss.
The assemblies Christ is wont to inspire
With sweet assurance, joy and bliss)
Cannot feed his faith with hearsay of a feast
He must first hold a Coroners inquest:
Must see Christ's ails,
And must
First thrust
In The print of oth' nails
His fingers; e're this faith enter his breast.
His faith must go on stilts or not at all:
See with the eye,
Feel with the hand,
His faith must in his fingers lie,
His faith must in his feeling stand,
At the bound from sorry sense he will catch the ball.
The week after he and they being all together
With blessed greeting
(Increase
Of peace)
Christ Crowns their meeting.
Thomas, says he, come reach thy finger hither.
As men are wont who have Children to be taught
My Lord was fain,
(Though every letter
In's hands and feet were printed plain)
With His finger teach him spell the better,
The Child to faith by fealing must be brought.
My Lord! and my God! (how this sight relieves me!)
Poor Thomas cries.
Christ says,
Thy faith
May thank thine eyes:
Blessed is he who sees not, yet believes me.
Disciples after this, a fishing go:
But nothing's caught,
Throughout the night;
Till Jesus comes, and brings a draught:
Lord show me so which side's the right,
When to catch souls thy Gospel net I throw.
Christ looked into their cup-board just before*
Children, have ye
Got meat
To eat?
Else come to me:
I Have food and firing for you on the shore.
Hence sinful cares; infest my soul no longer,
Base diffidence:
Doubtings retreat:
Soul, mind thy Saviors providence:
Do thine own work, and he will find meat.
Or give thee somethings better if thou hunger.
Dinner bee'ng done, Christ speaks of working then:
And so should we:
Our whet,
Not let
Our food should be.
Shepherds Christ feeds, to feed his sheep again.
Shepherds who love to eat but not to feed
Are what they are not,
Not what they are;
(A Paradox, and Gordian knot,
Which Christ will cut, and will not spare)
Shepherds in name but rav'ning wolves indeed.
Peter, do love me more then these? I Will prove thee.
Then feed and keep
My flock;
My st^ck
Of Lambs and Sheep.
All knowing Lord, says he, thou know I love thee.
Peter, when thou wast young, then thou wast free
To come and go
As thou would a mind,
Girding thy self: 't shall not be so
When thou art old, others shall bind,
And gird, and carry thee. Man! follow me.
Peter replies, and what must this man do?
What Is that to thee?
Follow
Me thou.
How busy we
Are to mind others works, our own not so.
In an appointed mount in Galilee,
Christ meets the eleven:
Charge them there,
By all his power in Earth and Heaven,
To Preach the Gospel every where;
Baptizing in the name of One and Three.
And in so doing, says, I Am with you still.
He shows Hells loss:
Deaths gate,
Sins state
Spoiled by his Cross.
Now is our Sampson got on Gaza's hill.
To prove my new bought right to every Nation,
New tongues I give
Unto you: Though
You drink what is deadly, you shall live:
Serpents and sicknesses shall know
And Devils too, that I have wrought Salvation.
A^ many years as Israel just had been,
Christ* days does spend
'Twixt the
Red Sea
Of's bloody end,
And Heavenly Canaan: forty days he is seen.
Meanwhile Christ Summons others from the dead
To evidence
His Resurrection:
From types, from texts, from faith, from sense,
Of proofs how full, how fair collection.
Shew'ng Christ is Risen as the Churches head.
Now, O devourer! where is thy victory?
Out of the grave
That old
Strong hold
And cating cave
Comes meat and sweetness; which who tastes cannot die:
Even Christ comes thence. And now in Olivet
Where he laid down
In part of pay
For the purchase of his new bought crown,
His bloody sweat: even there this day
To see's Inthronization Saints are me^:
Will thou restore the kingdom, Lord, they cry,
To Israel yet?
For you
To know
Times is not fit:
I Will send my spirit! that's my Lords reply.
O what an eager foolish thing is man!
Busy to know
What least concern him!
But to take forth, alas! how slow
The lessons that my God would learn him.
A sieve that lets go the flower but holds the bran.
Melchisedeck mean time, our Priest for ever,
With lift up hands
On his
All bliss
And grace commands;
Whom clouds receiving from their sight do sever.
But not from the eye of faith, which fixedly
Pursues their king;
Till Angels do
Tidings of 's second coming, bring,
In such sort as they would seen him go.
Cheer up, my drooping heart, thine head's on high.
Yet not so high, but that his heart's as low
As still to mind
Poor thee
Till he
Has made thee find
What for thy gain he sometime did forego.
Now'^ the forerunner ent'red in for thee:
Thy Lord's ascended;
Up and away:
When Christ first rose; this flight he 'ntended:
And art thou quickened here to stay?
May all my life but one Ascension be.
But I Am all fits and starts, and cannot get
Hold of mine own:
But clouds
Prove shrouds:
And all seems gone:
Sometimes I rise with Christ, but cannot fit.
Yet am I fixed, whilst Savior sits in Heaven;
There are no hills
And dales on high:
My Swampes my Saviors merit fills,
That all might in a level lie,
Making my state, though not my comfort even.
Why art thou then, my soul, disquieted?
Christ dwelt in dust
As thou
Do now;
Shall I not trust
Him, that drank of my brook, to lift mine head?
Is this the Butler that bore Pharaohs cup?
Though he forgot
Joseph in the Prison,
When raised himself, thy Lord will not
Reckon that he is completely risen,
Till all his foes are down and friends got up.
Down then, thou evil heart of unbelief!
Thou art a foe,
To me
I see,
To him I know:
A goal would fit thee well, for you are a thief.
Thou pick'st my comforts and thou steal'st his praise,
His and my loss
We lay to thee:
Betwixt two thieves Christ left one Cross
Void, that there hanged thou might be.
The arch-thief of all that rob on Gods highwayes.
Now as Mount Olivet for Sion Mount
Thou did forgo
Teach me
Like thee,
Sweet Savior, so
Heavens joys before earths fatness to account.
I determined not to know any thing save Jesus Christ, and him Crucified,

1 Cor. 2.2. SPIRIT.
MY Verse proceeds to him that by proceeding
Subsisteth in the Deity;
But cannot proceed without his speeding:
This Dove does teach all other birds to fly.
My callow muse has pinions but no wings,
Pinions indeed of ignorance;
Yet the Dove that hatcheth other things
Can fledge mine infant muse with utterance.
But th'ther day I saw a Lamb take wing
And fly to Heaven from an hill:
I watched to see if any thing
Would fall from him in flight, and found a quill,
Of which I made a pen, and fell to write
The story; writing, found a Verse;
Whilst on mine hand a Dove did light,
And had me with the Lamb the Dove rehearse.
My Master from mine head but th'ther day
The Clouds did take: unkind? or kind?
For whilst my Master went away
His Mantle dropped, which whosoever seeks may find.
I seek it: Blessed Spirit! Come and spread
Thy beaming wings and cover me
In thy bright light thy Poet lead
That in thy light would fain discover thee.
It Is only Sunshine that can show the Sun,
Alas! my Lord, my spirits flesh;
Dark-Lanthorn light is next to none:
My Frost-nipt blooms what Sunbeams can refresh?
Since then my carnal mind can never show
Or who, or what, dear Dove! thou art:
The spirit of my mind renew
And it shall reimburse what thou It impart.
Father and Son are God, and God's a Spirit,
And yet Gods Spirit neither is
Father nor Son; yet does inherit
With both an equal yet distinguished bliss.
Father and Son are God, and God is love,
Yet neither Father nor the Son
But their sweet spirit's the sweet Dove:
Each has his Spirit, yet they both but one.
By this eternal Spirit Christ the word
Offers himself to God and dies;
Yet by this Spirit does affoard
Of life unto dead sinners all supplies.
This Spirit's infinite: oh! who can flee
His presence and all-searching sight?
Yet he is a wind, which who can see
From whence it comes, or whither it takes flight?
This Spirit's infinite; dwells every where,
Fathoms all hearts, sounds every deep:
Yet how few Temples, Lord! are there
Wherein this holy Ghost does house or keep?
This active Spirit moves in every wheel.
Works as he will: does what he lists.
Man's heart's that only brass and steel
That the sweet Spirits motions resists.
This powerful Spirit did the Heavens garnish
And does renew earths withered face:
When winter washes off the vernish
And makes a verdant spring in every place.
And why not in my soul? Awake and blow
O North wind, and thou South wind come
Let all my sweets and spices flow
That he that owes my garden, may have s me.
Where the Lords Spirit is, there is liberty:
Yet a grim Sergeant one day came,
And neck and heels my soul did tie,
Saying, he did it in the Spirits name.
He did his ^ffice, and would not be bribed:
But as his warrant showed a writing;
Spirit of bondage, there subscribed
I spied; and found 'twas of his own inditing.
My heart before had been a bird of prey
But now bee'ng conquered by a Dove,
I think on it still how't sprangling lay
Crying for quarter to that bird of love.
I marked his bill but saw no Olive branch:
^eate I implored, but he denied;
What blood he drew, refused to stanch
Till I submitted to be mortif^ed.
Dear Dove, said I convince me, pierce me, grieve me:
Strike through and through this wretched heart
So that thou wilt but at length relieve me
And with thy gentle wings but stroke my smart.
Dear heart, said he I struck thee for to stroke thee.
Put thee in bonds to set thee free:
That I might better heal, I broke thee:
I Am sent to comfort by convincing thee.
Though I Am all light and peace, yet I did send thee
To a dark prison, holding over
My black rod, but it was to mend thee.
For friends do Fools and Phranticks thus recover.
Remember, man, thy wild and Bethlem tricks:
How often I strove with the in vain:
Thine heel could kick against my pricks.
Sure 'twas high time to get thee in a chain.
Thou, and Manasseh, stood in much more need
Of iron chai^s, then chains of Gold.
Distracted folk must purge and bleed
And in their months be caught and kept in hold.
O blessed bonds! said I, O happy trouble!
O bitter-sweet sweet-bitter smart!
My pain was great, my profit double
Whilst thus thou undertak'st to tame mine heart.
Void, Chymicks! spill your Spirits! quit your art!
Cease from your often sought, unfound stone:
There Is but one Spirit can convert
An iron chain into a golden one.
Dear Dove, thy prisoner may I ever be!
Bondage is like to be my state,
If to my self thou leave me free.
He Is only free whom thou do captivate.
Where the Lords Spirit is, there is liberty:
No man can say, Jesus is Lord
But by the Holy Ghost, or cry
Abba, till that sweet Spirit teach that word.
I was a lisper, and a stamerer
And could not skill oth' Shibboleth
That might my prayer to God indear
Till this free Spirit gave new speech and breath.
I was a beggar so extremely poor
I skilled not how to make my moanes:
But this Dove met me at Gods door.
Supply'ng my want of words with store of groans.
I was in suit, and could not well make good
My Title: But said this free Spirit,
Soul, take this seal, the seal of blood.
I am thy witness, and thou shall inherit.
I found a riddle whilst I sought a Text,
But this free Spirit loosed the knot:
Which when I h'd read, yet what was next
Had not this Spirit prompted I Would forgot.
My barren grounds were chapt for want of rain
Gasping toward Heaven for a flood;
This Spirit flowing in a main,
Told me that he had brought me that is as good.
I sea the mine heart found so much dross and tin
So ^it^^^ else; I self a mourning
Both for my gross and splendid sin:
Then he to me the spirit was of burning.
I fell a burning when my God did chide me:
Water, said I, or I Am undone:
This streaming Spirit straight supplied me
Till all those scorching flames were quenched and gone.
I fell a chilling till my heart grew stone:
Scarce had I left one warm desire:
My frozen heart was next to none:
Then said this holy Spirit I am fire,
I fell a melting when I felt his heat;
My soul was broached at mine eyes
The ice was thawn to tears and swear
Which with fresh gales this Spirit gently dries.
These fontinells thus dried pride raised a tumor
And then the Spirit's fain to take
His Lancet and let out the humor:
But, oh! mine heart how did it burn, and ache?
Which this dear Dove perceiving straight way goes
TO a precious box, and thence applies
An ointment made of Sharons Rose;
Which both the swelling cools, and mollifies.
When I was none, this Spirit made me be,
And live, and breath: when I was worse
(For worse then nothing, sin made me)
For my rebuilding freely did imburse.
My stony heart this spirit harcht to flesh:
My fleshly heart did circumcise:
My bleeding heart with balm refresh,
Those tears that fell from bleeding Saviors eyes.
In native gore when I polluted lay,
Hav'ng none to wash, to salt, to swath me;
His counsels were my salt that day;
His laws my swaddling bands: his grace did bathe me.
With milk for Babes this comforter did fill
Both Testaments, the old and new
But how to come by'^ I Would no skill
Till he those breasts of consolation drew.
He took me by the hand and taught me go
For I went all by forms before,
Till's holy unction made me know
A new and living way to Fathers door.
I got upon an hill, would fain descry
Heavens Canaan from earths wilderness
But being there, could nothing spy
Till with his eye salve he mine eyes did dress.
Over against Heavens haven on the shore,
I stood and waited for a wind
Then did this Spirit waft me ore
In heart, in hope, in faith, in joy of mind.
Arithmetic and thou art of measuring
I h'd studied, but bungled still;
The measure of a span to bring
O^ number of my days I could not skill:
Then this free Spirit gave a watch to me
Which ev'ryday wind up I must,
To tell me how my time did flee:
But I forgot, and let is stand and rust.
Then being grieved that I Would so direspected
Both gift and giver, did endeavor
To wind it up but to had collected
Such soil as from the wheels I could not sever.
Then did I moutning to the donour go;
Confessed my fault, showed him the soil
It gathered whilst neglected so:
Do not despair said he for I am oil.
This is the Spirit of all life and bliss
Yet when I felt him first, I died:
The fountain of my life he is,
Yet but for him I h'd near been mortified.
This Spirit in mine heart does sheed abroad
Gods dear and never dying love:
Yet not a day but his sharp rod
Does me severely chastise and reprove.
This Spiritrais'd my Christ, yet casts me down
Does cast me down, and yet uphold:
Mine humblings are my joy, my Crown;
My fear does make my faith more firm and bold.
Calms are not always proffitable for me,
Therefore the winds are sometimes high;
This Spirit blusters and is stormy,
That I might groundfast in humility.
This Spirit is my good and only guide:
Yet walk in the Spirit, Scriptures say.
My conduct, and my path beside
This Spirit is; my Captain, and my way.
Man walk according to thy native light,
Say some, and thou shall perfect be:
Perfect indeed as noon's at night:
Lord, in thy Spirits light, light let me see.
A spirit there is in man but the inspiration
Of the Almighty only can,
By no less than a new Creation,
Enlighten't; such a dungeon sin made man.
Man's spirit is the Candle of the Lord;
Which who would see by, first should light
At Gods own fire, even Gods own word:
Gods word's his mind seat us in black and white.
For since the incarnate word his tender love
In blood to write us condescends,
What wonder that his own dear Dove
In ink and paper prays us to be friends?
Nor Son nor Spirit had I understood
Bee'ng sunk so deep in sins dark grot
Had not the Son took bone and blood
Had not the Spirit pen and paper got.
The Son, in humane nature clad, does raise
My conscience out of guilts dark grave
The Spirit, clothed in humane phrase,
My mind out of blind ignorances cave.
The Son in servile form came down among's
Serving to purchase us command:
The Spirit fell in cloven tongues,
As who would lisp that we might understand.
Surely this Spirit of all Spirits framed
That Book of Books, my Bible dear:
A thing that is all things can be named:
Food, physic, treasures, pleasures, all are here.
A glass that shows to every man his face;
A staff that helps the lame to walk:
A spur that makes him mend his pace:
A light that shows what, and what not, to balk.
A Book that makes the simple truly wise:
A Book that proves the wisest fools:
A Book that helps the Readers eyes:
A Book that baffles, and befools the schools.
A Book whose every leaf, whose every line
Out shines the milky way as far
As if Heavens light should all combine
To darken and obscure one painted star.
A Book that told my story ere I was:
A Book that tells me what shall be
When I Am no more: what doom shall pass
On States, on Churches, Persons, and on me.
This Book's truths standard, nay, it is truth it self;
So well's the Spirit here pourtrai'd:
This Book does sanctify the shelf,
The heart, I mean, where it is sincerely laid.
Yet some by reason, some by new found light
Not only leave to question take
But mend this Book and set it right
By Tables of Errata's they would make.
So much is good, and it is Canonical,
As to man's reason is commensur'd:
Gods light, by man's, must stand or fall:
And so the Sun by the Sextons Clock is censured.
Methinks I love the Author for the Book:
The Book for the Author much more love:
When opening into it I look
My God, I cannot forget thy sweet spread-Dove.
The gentle wings I feel, and hear the mourning
Of that dear Turtle waiting still,
Upon my grieving and returning,
To bring an Olive Branch of peace in the bill.
The lines, I grant, are not all of one color
Yet all make up man's doom and duty
Some promise joy, some threaten dolor
Variety makes up the Turtle^ beauty.
This Dove Bezaleel and Aholiab taught
All curious works for the Sanctuary:
But Scriptures are more finely wrought
Showing most art, where they seem most to vary.
As when this one sweet Spirit is called seven,
Perfection's meant in unity:
A Spirit filling Earth and Heaven
That operates in all, but diversely.
Some reckon seven Suns to every week,
So many Moons to every year,
As she turns the whole face or half cheek
And does by turns first sit and then appear.
This Spirit makes in Sampson strength excel
And in a Moses government,
And wisdom in a Daniel,
And all much more in Christ, where't dwelt unpent.
This Spirit does transcribe the Gospell-story
On the fleshly tables of mine heart.
Christ's Cradle, Cross, his Grave, his Glory
All Is acted on that stage by the Spirits art.
To his Birth answers my Regeneration:
Heart-Circumcision suits to his:
To's Cross and Grave mortification:
And Grace and Hope to's Rising and his Bliss.
And then as Christ makes intercession for us,
The Spirit in us, intercedes:
With crying blood out Christ does store us,
With sighs and groans the Spirit in us pleads.
This Spirit is unbounded, yet believers
In earthen vessels this rich treasure
Only receive as he delivers,
And he dispenses each one but a measure.
This Spirit is eternalll, never dies,
An unextinguishable fire:
Yet in men's hearts often gasping cries
Oh! if you quench me thus I shall expire.
This Spirit is a Dove, yet to contest
With Crows and Vultures is he fain;
Whilst, in his room, man's wretched breast
Does lusts unclean, wraths, rapines entertain.
This Spirit is a Dove, yet's vexed often
By foolish man, that peevish wasp
Whose heart nor Sun nor shower can soften,
Man grieves him without whom he could not gasp.
This tender Spirit who but man would grieve?
If I my Comforter make sad,
Who only can sad hearts relieve,
Alas! my God, who then shall make me glad?
Grieve, foolish heart! be it to thine own perplexing
Be thou as melted wax in me,
That thou should set this Dove avexing
That sweetly seals redemption unto thee.
Give, stubborn heart, relent, since for thy sake
The Lamb of God not only blood,
But even Gods turtle tears does take,
Let thy repentance still help on the flood.
Melt, stony heart! till all becomes one river.
Dove do delight near ponds to dwell:
Groans are best music to a griever:
Such is Gods Dove, whose groans thy duty tell.
Show not thy self vexatious to a Dove,
That cannot grieve thee without grieving:
Even Publicans yield love for love.
Quench not truths Spirit by thy unbelieving.
Afflict not this dear guide: go not astray:
Nor look back from an holy life:
While the Spirit says this is the way,
Have salt in thee: remember, man, Lots wife.
Check not this Spirits checks, but let them be
Taken for kindness, as they are:
His smitings reckon oil to thee
Say, smits my rock, my God, and do not spare.
Grieve not this Holy Ghost, by entertaining
Such inmates as he cannot bear:
If bands of lusts thine heart be training
What room for this sweet Spirit can be there?
Seek holiness, seek peace, make after Union:
Let Medication stir this fire:
Prayer blow it up: let sweet Communion
Maintain it burning still, and raise it higher.
Quench not the smallest spark in thy weak brother:
What flames are on that hearth of thine
Boast not, nor yet deny or smother.
Rather desire thou for to burn then shine.
Some care not for this Dove had they his feather;
A sorry bargin such would make;
Over a while such shall have neither:
Seek thou the Spirits gifts for graces sake.
Ware sinning, against light and grace, and love:
Know, every of those sins that are done
Directly against this dear Dove
Comes near to that that never shall have pardon.
If we live in the SPIRIT, Let us walk in the SPIRIT.

Gal. 5.25. FAITH.
FRom thee, dear Dove,
Yet still in thine embraces,
To Faith, Hope, Love
That Trinity of graces
Now let me pass, and succor so my Verses
That I may express what my muse rehearses.
Faith, I Will begin
With thee; for thou wast the first,
When bloody sin
Had made me all accursed,
That showed the avenger posting after me,
And bad me to some refuge-City flee.
Some men would make
Faith and Repentance strive
Who should place take;
But surely Faith's the hive
In which that busy Be, repentance, makes
Tears drop like honey from man's heart like wax.
For who can grieve
For that which they believe not?
Who can believe
Man's sinful state, and grieve not?
I did believe the law, and so relented,
I did believe the Gospel, and repented.
I did believe
That God, made all things good;
And then did grieve
That I had brought a flood
A flood of sins, and so of miseries
On all: this brought a deluge on mine eyes.
I did believe
That God took flesh, lost blood
So to relieve
Me, and to drown sins flood:
Then girt like Peter did begin to swim
In a repentant Sea of tears to him.
Repentance lowers,
Yet (like sad rainy days)
Bring fruits and flowers
And floods to wash our ways,
Its Clouds bee'ng-fill'd with what bright faith exhales.
But's dry as desperation, when faith fails.
Yet have I heard
That some repented not
That afterward
They might believe. This knot
Is soon untied: First Faith lends tears and grief
Unto repentance, then an handkerchief.
Thus Faith precedes
Repentance yet comes after;
Follows, yet leads;
As Mother and as Daughter:
As the bright Sun the brackish Sea does round
Encompassing Repentance, Faith is found.
Faith, I would tell
Thy story if I could,
Where thou do dwell
Or what thou art, behold:
But thou art Faith which sense can no more reach
Then death Deity can praise, or preach.
I did ask at
Heavens gate for thee, dear grace,
But was told that
There vision held thy place:
Then some infernal fiends said they could show thee
But took thee for no grace, for they did rue thee.
I looked about
On earth to find thee there,
For there no doubt
Thou dwelst if any where:
And yet again the unerring Scripture says
When Christ shall come, shall he on earth find Faith?
Surely not much:
When he shall that day bring
Unto the touch
Each one that wears a ring
All will not prove Gold that glisters, and is specious,
Nor feigned Faith be then approved as precious.
Oh! that I knew
Thee, precious Faith; and could
Thy real hue
Thy luster but unfold
I should soon draw all eyes from him that has
Gold rings, to gaze on the poor when rich in Faith.
Alas! most take
Thee for some pebble, they
Do nothing make
To believe any way
Only those few that have thee, jealous are
Their Faith is not the right, the right's so rare.
Thou 'rt a rich stock,
A Diadem brought forth
Only by the rock
Of ages, of such worth
That who has thee, although he has no more
May well esteem the golden Indies poor.
By thee the just
May live, when wants surround:
And so he must
When other things abound.
Faith makes the conscience good and that well dressed
Is a continual food, a constant feast.
Of the household
Of Faith I Am sure I Have read;
And dare be bold
They want no houshold-bread:
Faith daily sets on the believers board
The Heavenly bread of the everliving word.
Others look by
Their trades to be maintained:
Why should not I
To be by faith sustained?
Thou art the calling: man but misapplies,
To other trades, the name of mysteries.
The mystery
Thou art, yet the Oedipu^
That do untye
All doubts and knots for us.
Nothing is hard to thee: where thou can not
Unriddle, thou'st a sword to cut the knot.
How blind were man
But for thy piercing eye?
Who nothing can,
No, not himself, descrie.
Thy clue guides through both Laborinth-like ways
Of mine own heart and through the Scriptures maze.
I should be set
And posed at first and last
In The Alphabet
But that, dear Faith, thou have
Taught me to know my letters. Who but thou
Could make me the Alpha and Omega know!
Or to know him
Aright? alas! my sight
Were dark and dim
But for thine eyes, thy light
Who see him that is invisible.
What flesh and blood perceives not thou see well.
Pray'r's a blind beggar,
If it do want but thee:
It may be eager,
But right it cannot be.
Hope were an hopeless thing but that thou do
Allow it spend upon thy proper cost.
Faith makes prayer know
Where to have its Ammunition,
And teaches how
To level each petition.
Of clamorous sin, quick prayer, by Faith, gains cope,
And brings salvations tidings back to hope.
In pilgrimage,
I went to Calvery
That bitter stage
Where my dear Lord did dye;
Where missing him, I cried out where is he?
Faith whispered to me, go along with me.
Faith brought me to
A door, but it was locked:
Faith bad me go
And knock, and so I knocked:
Then the door flew open and a Lamb did stand
Cry'ng take both fleece and flesh. But I h'd no hand.
But as my moan
I made with tears and grief,
Faith lent me one
So I took the relief:
Which having got I found that this believing
Both gives me Christ, and is of Christ's own giving.
But as I thought
To h've carried home this gift,
A Cross was brought
Which I was bad to lift
Or leave the rest: I tried but could not bear it:
Said Faith, I Will lend thee shoulders, do not fear it.
With much ado
I got this blessed pack,
Christ and's Cross too
By Faith upon my back:
But could nor go nor stand, till Faith did meet
Me just a sinking with a pair of feet.
Faith hav'ng new vampt
My soul, I then could walk.
Reason's sin-crampt;
And it is but idle talk
To speak of marching in its strength and might
Till Faith lends reason legs and sets it right.
We stand by Faith
Says Paul, we stand by reason.
Whoever says
I doubt me, does speak treason
They show their reason best that daily beg
Lord give us Faith, reason's a wodden leg.
Faith makes me see
What reason's asking still,
How can it be?
Let him take heed that will
Believe no more then he finds reason for
Lest he find reason to believe no more.
When Faith as Queen
Makes reason wait upon her,
Reason's then seen
Look like a maid of honor:
But let that saucy Courtier 'ware his head
That crowds the Queen into the truckle-bed.
In a few miles
March, betwixt this and Heaven
I found some styles
Not few'r then six or seven
That reason stumbling at; Faith, help me over,
Said I ^^ll poor Lame reason shall recover.
No sooner said
I so but Faith did lift,
Even as I prayed,
Me over with my gift:
Which done I fell aboard that sacred flesh
That so I might my fainting soul refresh.
Bee'ng cold and thin
The fleece I had received
I went to spin
And weave, but as I weaved
An enemy did cast a fiery dart,
Which but for the shield of Faith had killed my heart.
Where had that fleece
Said Satan, thievish sinner,
Of righteousness
That you are become a spinner?
I answered, false accuser, not by thieving,
Had I my Righteousness but by believing.
Believing? what
Do thou, poor foolish wretch
Tell me of that?
Said Satan, go and fetch
Gods Law-Book, and thy Conscience Book and say
If thou can stand as righteous any way.
Malicious foe,
Said I, cease troubling me,
Or else lets go
To suit in the Chancery.
Gods Common Law admits of mine appeals
To the Law of Faith that Righteousness reveals.
But equity
Requires thy debts be paid;
Said he; said I,
And satisfaction's made
By one that left his Cross, when he was slain,
That I therewith might thee, foul serpent! brain.
Then Satan flew,
Quitting the field. Anon
A numerous crew,
A WORLD it was, came on.
Thronging so thick and threefold in upon me,
That, had nor Faith pressed in, they had undone me.
Earth showed her strength,
Her treasures, pleasures, pride:
Giddy at length
Poor I began to slide,
Hold, man! said Faith, thou have a staff by thee
Christ's Cross can help thee stand, and force these flee.
But in this broil
Ere I the Cross could use,
I had a foil,
And got at inward bruise,
Conscience spat blood, pain pierced and wrung my side,
Till Faith some better blood like balm applied.
Faith also bad
A vein shoul opened be,
Urging I had
Much putrid blood in me:
Content, said I, for I had heard oth' art
Of saving Faith to purify the heart.
But lest I should
In bleeding faint, Faith took
Some Cordialls rolled
In Bible leaves, a Book
Whose every leaf, said Faith, rich drugs conteins
As I compound them, sovereign for heart-pains
Alas! said I,
Many those drugs have got,
But do decry,
Finding they profit not;
But strait remembered what the Sripture says
The word did not profit being unmixed with Faith.
O powerful Faith!
Whose every smallest grain,
If sound, who has
May say, and not in vain,
Mountains of guilt that here so long have stood
Get hence into the Sea of Saviors blood.
This skillfull grace
Did first Phlebotomize,
Then wash the place.
And after wipe mine eyes.
Dear Faith! said I, I see that thou do mean
Not only for to make me whole but clean.
As soon as I
Was cured of this my pain,
Impetuously
The world comes on again.
I took Faith's Cross, and found what Scripture says
Our victory over the world's our Faith.
Vain world be gone
Said I, vex me no more,
Vexation
And vanity's thy store
This Jacobs ladder helps me to discrye
A surer sweeter world beyond the sky.
By this dear Cross
My dearest Lord did climb:
I Will count thee loss
That I may follow him.
His and my Kingdom's not in the worlds enjoyment
If 'twere who knows where it would be next moment?
World thou must be
Set one day all on fire,
Witchchrafts in thee,
And blood deserve this hire.
Then shall my dust see by thy bright fire-light
To rise that morning that shall nere have night.
We do but jest,
Great Alexanders story
Is best expressed
When we say this worlds glory
Vanquished that seeming victor; sure I am
Nothing but Faith this world ere overcame.
When I begin
To fight, and want supplies;
Faith summons in
Heavens Auxiliaries;
And stores with precious promises that are
The very sinews of that holy war.
And more then this
Brings in a rare commander
Jesus it is,
Not Mars, or Alexander:
But he that taught all fingers fight, can quell
All foes, even Christ in the heart, by faith, does dwell.
Jerusalem
Above, that City is
Where David's stem
Raigns and remains in bliss
Yet it is his royal pleasure here in us
To dwell by Faith as in his Country House.
Faith makes man's heart
That dark, low, ruined thing,
By its rare art,
A palace for a King;
High'r then proud Babels tower by many a story,
By faith Christ dwells in us the hope of Glory.
Thus Faith does raise
Out of vile dust a Court,
Imputing praise,
Honor, and good report.
Hearts, Rahab like, when once they entertain
Heavens spies by Faith, a good report do gain.
If thou believe
All things are possible:
Faith can relieve
Even to a miracle:
This Faith can wash an Ethiopian clean,
Witness the Eunuch of Candace the Queen.
And as Faith makes
Us Courts, so Courtiers too:
God pleasure takes
In us when all we do
Is done in Faith, then reckoning that he has
Most glory by us, when most strong in Faith.
And as by this
Our service proves his pleasure;
Even so does his
Hereby become our treasure:
One day in Gods Cour^ Faith does far prefer
Before a thousand any other where.
It Is unbelief
In The evil, evil heart,
His and my grief,
That makes us ever part:
That Blessed Man whose feet this Faith has sh^d
With, Noah and Enoch still can walk with God.
By Faith who strives
To walk with God whilst here
Does live two lives
At once each day oth' year:
And dying Joseph like commands his bones
To Canaan there to dwell with living ones.
Dear Faith said I
My joy, my crown, my treasure!
Tell me whereby
I may do thee a pleasure.
Thou art that lock in which my strength does lie,
Thee not to tender were self-cruelty.
If thou would please
Me better, work me more;
Said Faith, it is case
Only that makes me poor.
But I do use to bid my workmen eat,
Said I; dear Faith, inform me what is thy meat.
Said Faith I came
Out of the eastern lands,
Old Abraham
And I have often shook hands:
My food's an Hebrew root that Gardners dress
On Lords Days mostly called the root of Iesse.
By hearing I
Came first; and we are fed
Most kindly by
The things whereof we are bred.
Forget not, if you love me, the Church-path:
Line upon Line's the way from Faith to Faith.
The careful foot,
That walks by Scripture-LEAVES,
Shall find th's ROOT,
Which happy who receives;
So nutritive, Antidotive and good
Who feeds on it, needs scarce fear any food.
Make but my bread
Of this root when I Sup
Let the Dragons head
Be then broke and served up:
Yet Toad-stools, one would think, need be well dressed
Ere they will make a good dish for a feast.
Art I did gain
Sometime, and that by book,
The Temters brain
To wholesomeness to cook.
Only have care as ever thou do mean
To keep me long in health to lodge me clean.
Good conscience is
An old comrade of mine,
Whom I cant miss:
If thou would make me thine,
And keep me, thou must keep him too; that day
Thou partst with him, look I should pack away.
Self confidence,
My natural enemy,
Must be packt hence.
An hand, a foot, an eye
Who has of's own, will scorn to be my debtour:
Who parts with these, works, walks and sees the better.
Prove that thou art
A Pilgrim: daily dye:
Of death get the start
And live eternally.
I that in Abrah'ms heart dwelt many a day,
To Abrah'ms bosom now show thee the way.
Fear always; Yet
Faint never: Eye the cloud
That does beset
Thee, that triumphant Crowd:
Look unto Jesus: watch the word of command,
Which, when thou have done all these things, is STAND.
By grace ye are saved, through Faith,

Ephess. 2.8. HOPE.
DRive on, my muse, till thou 'rt got through:
Let not Hope find thee in a slough:
Let that that drives the Farmers plough,
Drive thine much more.
To the Hope of Israel let me yet
In hope my running rhyme commit,
And humbly say, God prosper it;
Or 'twill be poor.
Hope is a door, the Scripture says;
And so is Christ, and so is Faith:
Who 're out of these doors are in wrath
And Condemnation.
Faith into Christ does first advent're:
Christ into Hope allows me enter:
Hope makes my very Soul to center
On Gods Salvation.
Hope is Faiths expectation:
Fa^^h is the Moses, Hope's the stone
That Faith in Prayer does rest upon
Till't overcome.
Faith does upon Hopes tip-toe stand
Stretching its neck to look for land
Beyond deaths gulf: and life beyond
The day of doom.
Hope is next door to Heavens gate;
It Is but a step from this to that:
Nay Hope does Heaven antedate,
And bring down hither.
Hope's the antidote against despair;
Coffin of fear; and Couch of care;
Cradle of patience: Hope has fair
Even in foul weather.
Hope is the mourners Handkerchief:
Hope is the Balm of every grief.
Hope does endorse the beggars brief
Ere it is collected.
In Hope I have, what yet I want:
Hope makes me full, while things are scant:
Hope does consummate, what I cannot
Yet see effected.
Hope has an harvest in the Spring:
In Winter does of Summer sing:
Feeds on the fruits whilst blossoming,
Yet nips no bloom.
Hope brings me home when I Am abroad,
As soon as the first step homeward's trod:
In Hope to thee, my God! my God!
I come, I come.
Hope sends the Ship to Sea, and then
Ere it returns, brings't home again:
The port of all Seafaring men
Is this GOOD HOPE.
I am a Sea man too. My Soul,
Though tossed with doubts when weather's foul,
Does like some Sea-sick vessel roll;
Yet Heaven's its scope.
Hope does the Soldiers weapon wield:
By Hope the Soldiers Helmet's steeled:
Hope gives him, ere he fights, the field:
Hope holds his station.
I am a Soldier too. My Sword,
Is that oth' Spirit, the two-edged word:
Now for an Helmet give me, Lord,
The Hope of Salvation.
Hope sets the poor Apprentice free
First day he is bound. And why not me?
Thou have Indentures Lord by thee
Wherein I Am tied.
Mount Sinais Covenants they be
Yet Hope does, Lord, Enfranchize me
In Sion-hill, where all are free
That do reside.
In Hope the School. Boy does commence
Master of Art, and fair science:
Yea whilst in the lowest form steps thence
To the Doctors Chair.
I Am a School-Schollar too, My God!
But yesterday I felt thy rod:
Yet still with Hope am girt and shod.
Away, despair.
'Ti^ Hope that does the sower feed;
Who seems to cast away his seed,
But does preserve in very deed
And mend his store.
I am a Seeds-man too, my Lord!
And but for Hope thou would affoard
Thy blessing, when I sow thy word,
I had forbore.
I am a Seeds man; every tear
I sow in Hope, 'twill bring an care
Fit for thy floor in time of year
For thee to gather.
Were It not for Hope the heart; some say,
Would break; yet Hope led me one day
Weeping along the Milkie way
To thee, O Father!
I am a Seeds man casting bread
On the waters where it seems lie dead;
Yet Hope assures me 't shall be fed,
And then restored.
Hope does the prisoners bolts unlock:
His fetters does in sunder knock:
Hope drives the Freemans trade and stock.
My dearest Lord!
I am a captive too. Sins chain
Does hold and hamper, but in vain:
By Hope I Am saved, and set again
At liberty.
I am a Tradesman too. Thou art
That God with whom I deal. My heart
Takes Heaven to be the only mart,
Thither trade I;
Exporting groans and broken prayers
That scarce can clamber up the stairs.
Importing rich and precious wares,
Even joy and peace.
Joy that exceeds all understanding
Oth' Spirits sealing, Christ's own handing:
Peace that is of Gods own commanding
And cannot surcease.
Hope makes the labourer to run
A race as 'twere with each days Sun
Paying his wages ere's work be done,
And mine much more.
I daily dig and delve within
Stubbing at the roots and stumps of sin
And but for Hope one day to win
I should give ore.
O come that longed for day! come quickly!
This Hope deferred makes my heart sickly.
Grace is a Rose, but sin is prickly
And still adheres.
Amphibion like the diver tries,
Whet sharp with Hope, to anatomize
And geld the deeps: his hoped for prize
Forbids his fears.
I am a diver too. Thy word
Does richer rarities affoard:
A greater deep, and better stored
With Pearls and treasure.
Angels desire to dive into
These deeps; and so I daily do:
Whose Pearls are rich and Cordial too;
Health, Wealth, and Pleasure.
It Is Hope that makes the racer fleet,
Bringing the wager to his feet,
Make have, says Hope, what? don't you see it?
You Have won, you have won.
I am a racer too. My race
From sin to glory is by grace;
Hope sets Heavens Bliss before my face,
And then I run.
I heard the witty world once say,
The bird in the bush may fly away:
Take Heaven who will, it is present pay
For which we trade.
To Faith and Hope I told this story;
Their havings are but transitory,
Said Faith: said Hope, and I have glory
That cannot fade.
Have it? said I; Hope, show it me.
What Is this, said Hope, thou here do see?
Said I, an Acorn: No, said he
But it is an Oak.
What is it, said Hope, thou see fast by?
A grain of Mustard seed, said I.
A plant, said Hope, reaching the sky;
And thou would right spoke.
Then I perceived the meaning was
Hope ripens seeds of Grace to Grace:
Makes Grace, when grounded, Mount and pass
To the highest story.
Hope showed me then a sparkling stone
What Is this, said Hope, that I Have got on?
I strait replied, it is Grace begun.
Said Hope, it is glory.
Then learnt I that Grace inchoate,
By lively Hope does maturate:
And ripening, does anticipate
Heaven here on Earth.
I spoke to Hope of a reversion
I had in Heaven since conversion:
Said Hope, why cast you an aspersion
On the second birth?
Reversion sounds, said Hope, to me
Your state at present dead to be
But I have Heaven in hand, you see.
Whereon I live.
I am Faiths present recompense:
My Grammar knows no Future tense:
The Verbs that make up all my sense
Are Substantive.
Who 're these, said Hope, thou see before,
Prostrate and begging at a door.
Said I, they are Heavens Parish Poor:
Said Hope, they are Kings.
Kings? said I. But where are their Crowns?
Their Scepters, Kingdoms, Countries, Towns?
Their Armine Robes, and Purple Gowns,
Those royal things?
I can, said Hope, tell where they be:
Safely they are reserved by me,
Safely reserved from them and thee:
Look here are they.
All Is locked. Hope, lend's the key, said I.
Hope fetch a Bible presently:
On which when I h'd but cast mine eye
I found a key.
The right key 'twas oth' door of Hope
Enter, said Faith, thou ^^edst not ^rope:
I turned the key, and the door flew open,
And I went on.
But O the things that there I saw!
Jewels of joys, in foiles of awe!
But blab not, Muse. Know not the Law?
Peace, and have done.
It Is not allowed thee to display
The brightness of Hopes holy day.
Unutterable things to say;
Muse, do not vent're.
Hope showed me, but I cannot say what.
Only let him that questions that,
But get the key, that then I gat;
And let him enter.
Then let him say, If ever he
The like things unto those, did see:
Or yet can utter what they be
That there he saw.
This only can I say, that there
Crowns, Scepters, all enameld were
With Grace and Peace, with Faith and Fear,
With Love and Awe.
True Hope though pleasant, yet is gracious:
Not light, though lightsome: Not audacious,
Though bold: though joyous, not salacious:
Merry, not vain.
Hope can rejoice, but never rant:
Allwaies feeds high, but revell cannot:
Chaste Scripture comforts that provant
Does Hope sustain.
The word whereon I hope, does urge
Pureness: the fire wherein I forge
The Anchor of mine Hope, does purge
My dross, my ^in.
That Hope makes not ashamed, but sure
The bottom's rock, and shall endure;
That makes me strive, as God is pure,
To purge my sin.
True Hope's a Jacobs staff indeed:
True Hope is no Egyptian reed:
That springs from mire, or else can feed
On dirt, or mud.
By Hope just men and sanctified
In The Ocean safe at Anchor ride
Fearless of wrack by wind or tide
By ebb or flood.
Hope's the top-window of that ark
Where all Gods Noah's do imbark:
Hope lets in skie-light, else how dark
Were such a season?
But would not be engulf'd, or drowned
When storms and tempests gather round;
Ere thou can Anchor, try the ground:
Hope must have reason.
Hopes Anchor-hold can not be good
Where the bottom's all or only mud.
Shall th'Sinner in his Native-blood
To Hope pretend?
Or the Hypocrite strengthen his mast,
(Who boldly does Hopes Anchor cast
On's sandy bottom) when at last
Heavens storms descend?
'W^re Cob-web-Hopes, when God shall come
With His besome of impartial doom
To sweep man's heart, that inner room;
Shall they stand sure?
Often have I seen a branch in spring
Rent from the root, yet blossoming,
As 'twere some Hopeful growing thing,
But cannot endure.
He that is at the pains and cost
To plant and water it, next frost
Is like to see his labor lost,
And hope to perish,
Surely 'twill pose all skill and art
But only his, that can convert
This lively Hope in a dead Heart
To plant and cherish.
And where there is but a name to live,
Though for a season Hope seems thrive,
When such give up the Ghost they give
Their Hopes up too.
Good Hopes through grace. And whosoever
Part Righteousness from Hope endeavor
The Helmet from the Brestplate sever,
Which who would do?
But let what waters will assail,
The Hope oth' righteous cannot fail,
Whose Anchor's cast within the veil
Till the flood asswages.
His Hope's no Lott'ry, hit or miss;
But an Inheritance it is:
Christ is in him the Hope of Bliss,
That rock of ages.
Mine eyes are unto Sion-hill
Longing in Hope, yet waiting still
For he that shall, will come, and will
Not always linger.
Therefore in Hope will I rejoice,
Yea when the floods lift up their voice;
When Seas shall roar, to drown their noise,
I Will turn a singer.
I Will turn a singer, and my song
Shall be by book, lest I go wrong:
For I h've not skilled of music long,
Or holy mirth.
Weeping into the world I came,
Bringing a world of sin and shame:
Bearing the first Apostates blame
Even at my birth.
The fruit old Adam and his Eve
Did so long since together thieve,
Wringing my mother made us grieve
And groan together
And as I thus did weeping come
Out of one grave, I mean the womb;
My face was toward a deader Tomb
And I bound thither.
My life was but a Bondage through
The fear of death, that fatal slough.
But lively Hope forbids me now
All slavish fears.
Often have I been contemplating
Of death that melancholic thing;
Weeping, till Hope has made me sing
Drying my tears.
Author and rock of all my Hope,
That have deaths prison-doors broke open,
So fastening to Faiths Cable-rope
Hopes Anchor strong.
What though I sail through foaming Seas?
Billows are Pillows, Beds of ease:
Deaths blast rocks me asleep in these;
Waiting erelong
At thy shrill sudden voice to rise,
And rub deaths dust out of mine eyes
When death shall have disgorg'd its prize
Safe on the shore.
Then hold my rudder in thine hand
Who put to Sea at thy command
Till I may make some newfound land
Oh! help me ore.
I need not want an anchor, Lord,
With wood and iron, bee'ng so stored.
With what thy Cross and Nails affoard
Had I but skill.
Anchors, I see, by the Forgers art,
Have both a strait and bending part:
Hope strengthens, yet it bows the heart
To wait Gods Will.
The Scripture says that tribulation
(And it is a strange Concatenation)
Works patience; as if vexation
Did make more quiet;
And Patience works Experience:
Experience, Hope: Yet Patience,
I Am sure: does live on Hopes expense
For daily diet.
Thus have I seen the Grand-Childs purse
For the Grand-Siers support disburse
Thus Hope does Patience feed and nurse;
Patience again
Does tutor Hope, and teach it know
All points of Heavenly Courtship; How
To wait on God, to bend, to bow,
To bear his train:
To follow him in all his ways,
And so to hold even all its days,
Seeking that honor, glory, praise
That God shall give.
Patience of Hope makes Heaven smile
To see the trodden Camomile,
Whilst underfoot, spring up the while
And the more thrive.
When death comes, with his leaden foot,
Hoping to crush mine Hope in the root,
The utmost hurt that death can do it
Is but to make
Mine Hope grow up into fruition;
Whilst Faith's translated into vision
Mending thereby my souls condition
Doubling my stake,
What though mine Haven, Heaven lie
Beyond the dead Sea? what though I
Decease? mine Hope shall never dye,
Never decay.
What though I walk through the vale of tears?
Hope is a staff that ever bears:
Hope is a rod chasing my fears
Guiding my way.
What though revengfull Papists burn
Dear Bucers bones still Hope's his urne
Till's ashes to a Phaenix turn
And live afresh.
What though deaths scorching flames presume
To turn my moisture to dry fume?
My soul shall one day reassume
Calcined flesh.
Therefore my dying tongue shall sing:
Yea even my flesh that fading thing
Shall rest in Hope for that dayspring
All the night of death.
And when I lay my weary head
And bones in the grave as in a bed,
Let not the mourner say he is dead,
But slumbereth.
Yet bonie death sometimes looks in
Bringing a list of all my sin
Pinching mine Hope till it looks thin
And's like to dye:
Death in my very face does stare
So ghastly, as if it meant to scare
And fright mine Hope into despair,
While sin stands by.
Ah Conscience! Conscience! when I look
Into thy Register, thy Book,
What corner of my heart, what nook
Stands clear of sin?
And though my skin feels soft and sleek,
Scarce can I touch my chin and cheek,
But I can feel deaths jaw bone prick
Even through my skin.
Yet why art thus cast down, my soul?
Hope still in God, and on him roll.
If Heaven smile, what though death scoule,
And Conscience loure.
A Book of my dear Christ's I have
By which I look my God will save
My soul from sin, my flesh from grave,
And from deaths power.
O death, where is thy victory?
That I might live, my Lord did dye
He fled thee not, but made thee fly,
Hav'ng drawn thy sting.
Thou had of teeth a double row,
Till Christ by's Cross took thee a blow
When fastening on him. But you are now
A tooth-less thing.
Well may thou bark, but can not bite,
Bending thy brow, showing thy spite:
Death do thy worst: Hope sets me quite
Beyond thy spleen.
What though my death seems written in
The very parchment of my skin
With the black ink of my foul sin;
Yet have I seen
On both hands of a friend once slain,
But since returned to life again,
A better story Printed plain,
My sights but dim;
Yet in the print oth' nails I see
Life in a Saviors hands for me
Whilst as he hung upon the tree,
Hope hangs on him.
And still shall hang on him until
My bones have learnt to climb that hill
Where now he sits, and whence he will
Yet come down hither
That he may gather into one
Each dust of his, and scatt'red bone;
Then shall he, as a living stone
Translate me thither.
And now, my Lord, what wait I for,
Standing, and knocking at thy door?
I stand and knock at the door of Hope
Till knocking makes the door stand open.
We are saved by HOPE, but Hope that is seen, is not Hope,

Romans 8.24. LOVE
FRom Faith and Hope I come sweet Love to sing
For every Anchor has its ring
Whereby it is wedded to its Cable-Rope.
Love makes the match 'twixt Faith and Hope.
'Twixt Grace and Grace no marriage can be made
But where this golden ring's first had.
O golden Love, thou circling, endless thing!
All grace concenters in thy ring.
What though mine heart be flinty rock and stone?
Yet flints have fire: And have I none?
No spark of Love, thou God of Love! for thee
That have twice over hammerd me?
There Is not one spark kindled upon mine hearth
But at first glance it quits the earth,
As if it knew the element of fire
Were some Diviner thing and high'r.
Lord, I can feel there is such a thing as Love
Warm in my breast, and feel it move;
I find I love my Child, and so does he:
And shall I not, my God! love thee?
Is Love the only fire that does descend?
Or is my God, my God, no friend?
Sure all my doubts and fears cannot disprove
The condescension of thy Love.
The Elements, we find, invert their course,
Fearing a Vacuum would be worse:
And did not Love stoop low, when God did dye
To fill up man's vacuity?
Reader! stop here:
And drop a tear!
When Love that, every Evening, makes my bed
Had not whereon to lay his head:
Except you will call that bloody Cross and bitter
A Lovesick Saviors bed and litter.
When Love it self being as rich as store
To make me rich ^id become poor:
Unless those tears and bloody drops that fall,
You Will Pearls account and rubies call.
And can the flaming Element of Love
To store my wants drop from above?
Why cannot mine Earth as well to Heaven grow,
As Heavens Love fire come down so low?
Why may I not, Elijah-like, aspire
To ride to Heaven in that fire,
That fire of Love that came from thence down hither
On purpose sure to help methither.
When Love to hatred did himself expose,
And prick's own foot to ease his foes:
Printing full proof in his chapt parched skin
What flames of Love there were within.
When Love unthought, unsought for did come down
Exchanging, for a Cross, his Crown
Love undesir'd, Love undeserved did take
Man's game to play to save man's stake.
Whilst flames of wrath so sorely did contest
With this Love-fire in Saviors breast
Heightning the heat so far till's blood boy^'d ore,
Issuing out at every pore,
Lord! can the eye,
That reads, be dry?
Ah! if it can; let not the writers be:
No tears of Love, my God! for thee?
Lord! could Love make thee take my sins as thine?
Sure then thy sorrows shall be mine.
The stripes that rent thy back, shall smite and knock
My breast, till they have cleft my rock.
The ir'n that in thine hands left such a p^int
Shall strike some fire out of my flint.
Shall I not love that friend that loved me So
So Loved me when I was his foe!
Lord! let not want of Love increase my score!
My debts were great enough before.
Make me thy Love so burning hot to feel,
As to dissolve and melt my steel:
And burn my stony heart to fervent lime,
As I h've seen fire turn stone sometime.
My heart is thine; Lord thou have bought that stone
And thou have fuel of thine own:
Will It not quit cost? great builder! if it will,
O throw mine heart into thy kill.
Lime is an useful thing in buildings sure:
And lime of stone will best endure:
Knowledge puffs up, but Love is edifying,
And grows the stronger by long lying.
Oh that I had that lime of Love that is
(As by Antiperistasis)
Hotter for water! I would often then
Weep till I even flamed again;
But now I mourn,
That I cannot burn.
Cannot burn? Alas! my God, I Am burning ever:
But oh my burning is a Fever.
Such hectic heat does too too plainly prove
That I am but infirm in Love.
Lord, do not see how Giants do invade
Thy right? my God, confound their trade,
Who using lust for lime, by Hellish art,
Would rebuild Babell in my heart.
It Is not so long my God and Savior since
Thou did expel the usurping Prince
Rasing his works and strong holds built within
With lime of lust and piles of sin.
Can I Love sin, that hateful cruel thing,
That grinds the Serpents forked sting;
Shew'ng death how twice at once to murder me?
And can I not, my God, Love thee?
Can I Love sin, that puts me on the wrack
Till bones do break and sinews crack?
And Can I not Love him that climbed the tree?
Wracking himself to take down me?
Can I Love sin, since hatred nere had bin?
Never bin heard of but for sin?
And can I not love LOVE, that came to dye,
To kill hatred and enmity?
Love sin, that founded Hell at's own expense?
And not my God that saves me thence?
Alas! how strangly Love its mark can miss!
Oh that mine head and heart for this
Were both one flood
Of tears of blood!
Or can mine heart like Joseph's Mistress, make
Love to the Servant? and mistake
These things below for my dear God above
To whom I owe even all my Love?
And then when these chaste Creature Comforts fly
Rather then yield, or gratify,
Can I complain unto my Lord, and say
That they did tempt then fly away?
Alas! poor Creatures would not be abused:
And must they yet be thus accused?
And God in them? And that I may be found
Guiltless, must guilt reach God at the bound?
Thou gav'st me these to prove thy Love to me,
But not to steal my Love from thee:
I cannot Love the giver, for his gift;
Alas! my God, that is a poor shift.
Why? shall I court the Bearer, that does bring
Forgetting him that sends the ring?
All Creature-good in this world or the next
Being but a comment on Loves Text:
This whole Creation being but one round drop
Hanging down from loves fingers top,
If all the world were Pearl, yet why should I
Desire to wear it in mine eye?
So that for this worlds Love I should not see,
My dearest Lord, how to Love thee?
Can I so Love the world? And cannot I yet
Love God that made both me and it?
Lord, I must cry,
Here Is Witchery!
If the world be the inchantress, Lord, I pray
Hasten the General Judgment day!
For sure my Love, when 't sees the witch a burning
To its right wits will be returning.
But rather I suspect it is Hells black-art
That from my God thus charms my heart.
Remembering 'twas the wily Serpents plot
That first brake the True-Lovers-Knot.
When Baalams Divinations could not move
From Gods dear Israel Gods dear Love,
But God that loved them once, would love them still,
Though Balaam went from mount to hill.
He next instructs the Moabites to lay
Adult'rous Loves in Isr'els way
To quench their Love to God through wanton fire
And thereby to incense Gods ire.
And if this world play the Moabitess;
It Is Satan's project, Lord, I guess:
Who see'ng he cannot divert thy Love from me
Would thus divide my Love from thee.
And, is mine heart divided? ah! my God,
Whose clo^en foot thereon has trod
The print discovers. What though Balaam's dead?
Thou God of peace! bruise Satan's head.
But I am most afraid the worst's within:
The witchcraft of my native sin.
Sin winds and circles, Lord, so many ways
Till sin ofttimes the Devil raise;
Lord! thou art fire,
Give sin her hire.
Burn up this witch, her crafts, and Philtre-pots:
Sins books of curious arts, charms, knots,
By thy refining Spirit, that I may
Get warmth of Love to thee that way.
Who has bewitched me that I am so coy
When thou would fain my Love enjoy,
Thou, blessed Three, stand'st suing for mine heart
Who only can fill every part?
Dear God! who has bewitched me that I cant
Deny the courting world a grant,
That never yet could fill my heart, unless
It were with griping emptiness?
The garment of thy goodness is entire;
Can keep me warm without a fire:
To which this whole creation's but a shred,
Each Creature's but one single thread.
To give these things their due, they are good for use:
And lovely too: unless their juice,
By Love inordinate, be dried up;
Leaving behind an empty cup.
And is gold rich? and can the mine be poor?
Theirs at the best is borrowed store.
Nay, so long borrowed that it now grows old:
O that my Love could wax as cold,
As cold to earth, as earth is in decay:
But more intense to God each day!
Who Will soon serve earth for all its glittering grace
As we do serve old Silver-lace,
Lord! fire this pile
Of man mean while.
I h've heard good husbands say, that they that borrow
Their stock to day, may break to morrow:
Sure the worlds credit cannot long hold good.
It Is much the world thus long has stood.
Consid'ring when the world's in fullest trade
How poor and sorry payment's made
Him, that owes all, and must his right recover;
Sure the world must then all trade give over:
Shall I not therefore deal in the interim
Less with the world, but more with him,
With him whose Love's an unexhausted spring
Of every good and perfect thing.
Methinks men's trading with the world might stop
At thought of this who keeps her shop.
Alas! my God, the world is Devil ridden:
The thing is known and cannot be hidden.
Hell has deflour'd the earth, and now I see
'T would put its leavings off to me,
Dawbing false paint on the face oth' wrinkled Creature
Hav'ng worn and spoiled its native feature.
The earth's all Egypt now: And Egypts curse
Is over all the world, or worse:
For Beelzebub with his swarming train
Has all things flie-blown. To be plain
There is no flesh that is sweet, but Saviors, now.
Which Satan tried, but knew not how
To taint. All Is dogs-meat else. Lord! teach me choose
And I shall all the rest refuse,
And only wish
For that one dish.
A dish that is wholesome, and it is healing too.
Ah my dear God! what shall I do
To Love thy flesh enough that tasted once
For ever heals my broken bones.
Set thine apart, all other flesh is grass:
And is my soul an ox or ass?
That it should Love no higher then my beast?
Or can my soul such fare digest?
Come, Trencher Critics, you that eat by book,
And in your food for physic look,
Your Cook must be some small Apothecarie,
Will you allow a Verser vary
From your received rules? and be content
To try a new experiment?
Flesh in a feaver's good Divinity,
Which who most eats, scapes best, say I.
Provided that the flesh be sound and good
(For I would be right understood)
As never did, nor could, corruption see:
Ah my dear Savior! I mean thee.
Alas! how low in an high burning Fever
Of Gods displeasure, never never
To have been cured otherwise, did sin
Once bring me, till I did begin
To fall aboard that sacred flesh? And then
How soon did I grow well again?
Then welcome, gentle guest, if thou have not
To prize and Love thine health forgot,
Come sit down here
And Love this Cheer.
Or tell me is it sweetness and delight
That rather does thy Love invite?
What more delicious, sweeter thing can be
Than that sweet blood was shed for me?
When I Repentance take, that purging pill
I take it in this Syrup still:
Wha^ purges, pains; and would too much corrode
^^t for this sweet emulgent blood.
You curious Palates, that cannot let one glass
Without a strict Examen pass
Come taste, and tell me if (this blood) this wine
Ben't generous and genuine?
The Vine is Divine, nay'tis somewhat more;
And can the blood oth' Grape be poor?
It Is this High-Country-Wine that fills my cup,
When at my Saviors board I sup.
Wine, that is as sweet as wrath of God is bitter,
Which, who has tasted is the fitter
To relish this rich liquor. Wrath makes dry
But here is the cup of Charity.
This is the grace-cup. Nothing's sweet nor good
Till dashed or sprinkled with this blood.
Men are but Swine, wines are but swill before
This blood man to himself restore.
A Wine so good, fallen Angels might not taste it;
Who therefore did contrive to cast it
Upon the ground; which when they thought to spill
They broached for man against their will.
Lord who can love
Thy blood enough?
Or do you Love for Loveliness? Come hither;
My Lord is Lovely altogether.
Alas how amorous wits forget their duty
To this supreme and perfect beauty!
You fond admirers of a skin-deep hue,
To dusty beauties bid adieu,
To dusty beauties that have marred your eyes:
Ah my dear God! that wit were wise!
It cuts mine heart to see much silken wit
And snares and halters made of it.
Halters to the owners, snares to th'passers by.
How fast loose wit can wantons tie,
And stake them down! till first the lover burns
In heart, and then in Hell by turns.
But say his Love be chaste; And she a flower;
All Is next to nothing the next hour:
It Is killed with kindness, dies when complemented,
And soonest fades when it is most sented.
Whose Muse does dress his Mistress, hangs a Verse
To day upon to morrows Hearse:
Friends must be then called in to have away
What wanton wit adores to day.
Skin-beauty's but a Sodom-apple just:
When crushed, it turns to stench and dust.
The wanton world complains their Love is blind
And I must needs be of their mind;
Whilst for such walking shades they cannot see
My dearest Lord, how to Love thee.
Yet thou art fair
Beyond compare.
Had I a wit, and had I grace I Would bring
My Savior an enameled ring,
A ring whose Posie should be this alone,
Stars get ye gone, the Sun has shone.
Stars? I mean glowworms: earthen beauties which
In The dark do sparkle in a ditch,
And fools mistake for Stars; ill touch informs,
And proves them to be silly worms.
But, Lord, my Muse unworthy is to bear
The shoes that thy fair feet do wear.
Fairer for bee'ng so swift, swift to shed blood;
Their own I mean to do me good.
How fair's thy face then? may I, Lord, one day
Have leave to see, though none can say
How fair it is. My dear, the Sun's a Clod
To thy bright face, fair Son of God!
Wherein still fresh and fresh together grows.
With valleys Lilly, Sharons Rose.
A rose that never bare prickles of its own;
Yet sinners thorns did Savior crown.
And shall I Love my Champion less for scars
He gat in waging of my wars?
Thy bruises are but beauty spots, my dear,
That make thy Love more fair appear.
Who loves for fleshly gloss and silken skin
May find a Serpent often within.
But thy deep wounds, Lord, prove thee that thou art
All Lovely to thy very heart.
Beauty thus deep,
Will hold and keep.
Or is it Knowledge, Learning, Science, art
That takes the more ingenious heart?
Come, bookish man, and sit a while down here;
Till thou have read my dearest dear.
What Is that that is printed in his hands and feet?
The print is plain, man, do not see it?
A mystery that learned flesh and blood
Never taught yet, nor understood.
I h've sometime stood and wondered at the Owls
How they should prove Minerva's Fowls:
But since have learnt that learning's blind as Love
Till both be tutour'd from above.
Oh what a Dungeon is the mind of man,
Let Pallas paint it what she can!
Some would not be such fools but that they are wise:
And might see better but for eyes.
Lord shall I Love to know, and not know thee,
In whom all wisdoms treasures be?
Great Magazine I whose wisdom's infinite,
Give me that Panoplie of light.
An Epictetus or an Antonine
In The dark may make a shift to shine:
But being by thy Sun-light understood
Alas, my God, prove putrid wood.
Shall ventrous Students every Toads-head look
For Pearls of knowledge? And thy book,
Thy works lie by unlov'd, unlooked into?
Thy Pupills, the Angels don't so do:
But help their sight
By Gospell-light.
Or do I Love for likeness? Ah, my dear,
Whose Image was it I first did bear?
Whilst yet I stood in Primitive perfection
Lord, what was I, but thy reflection?
So like thee that thy self thou could not Love
But Love me too: Nor could I move
Thy Love from me, till I thy likeness lost
Thine Image bee'ng sin-slur'd and crossed.
But now I Am hateful grown and hating too
Alas, my God, what shall I do
To Love thee and to be beloved of thee?
My Lord, thy Love preventeth me.
For since the ground of liking likeness is,
Rather then my poor Love thou would miss;
Since cursed sin made man unlike his maker,
God of man's likeness was partaker.
When sin, to man's undoing, had undone
Gods Image; God next sent his Son
In likeness of poor sinful flesh; thereby
Condemning sin in the flesh to dye:
My God was hungry, thirsty, naked, poor:
In fears, in tears, in sweat, in gore:
Was tempted, was betrayed, forsaken, sold,
Was captivated, kept in hold.
Was judged, condemned, was killed, was buried then
That he and I might rise again
In one Divine and sweet similitude
And Love in likeness be renewed.
And can I yet
Thy Love forget?
Or do I Love for consanguinity?
For nearness and relation? why
For me Christ took, and shed that Blood of his;
And do I ask how near he is?
My Lord is much more mine, then I mine own
My Lord was mine, when I was none:
My Lord, when I was lost and gone astray,
Was both my Shepherd and my Way.
Surely my Lord and I are near skin,
Ere since my Savior was made SIN
Form, and I made RIGHTEOUSNESS in him.
He is my head and I a limb:
He is the Vine, and I the branch: the root,
Whereof I am a slip or shoot:
Of my salvation he the captain is,
And I am a reprize of his.
He is my Father, I his seed: nay he,
In travail of his soul, bare me:
My brother too, born for adversity;
The Joseph of the family.
He is my Maker, yet mine husband too:
This Potter me his clay did woo:
And rather then he would miss the match did make
Him a clay-body for my sake.
Even all men Love their own, and shall I not?
Help Lord, and I will knit the knot.
In full acceptance of thy free donation:
Clasp hearts and hands in sweet relation
Lord, thou art mine,
Make me more thine!
Or do I Love for suitable supplies
To all my wants? sure I want eyes
Or I could not want Love, my Lord, to thee
In whom all blessings treasured be.
O that my drop into a Sea could swell
Of Love to him, in whom does dwell
All fullness, as in bank or house of store,
Even Grace and Bliss for evermore.
Thine bee'ng once asked if they would away,
O whither shall we go? said they
The words of life eternal, Lord, thou have.
And that is a stock can never wast.
Goodness is all contracted in thy face,
As Sunbeams in a burning-glass:
Oh that I lay in some directer line
That I might burn whilst thou do shine.
Am I a sinner? you are a propitiation:
I h've wrought confusion, thou salvation.
I h've purchased death both for my self and thee,
But thou to life have ransomed me.
As God, thou see; as man, thou feel'st my grief.
As both, you are suitable relief:
My Creditour, and yet my Surety too:
Paying and pard'ning what I owe.
Creatures are Cisterns, leaking vessels, they
Cannot supply themselves one day
And me much less. My springs are all above
My light, my life: Why not my Love?
Oh it is thy right:
Accept my mite.
Or is it Love that sharpens Love again?
My Savior, every grinding pain
Of thine on Earth, and present Intercession
Pleads for a Love beyond expression.
It Is Love I live upon. And do I yet
Suspect thy Love! or question it?
Lord, if my Living be n't full proof, thy dying
Gives evidence beyond denying
Herein is Love without dissimulation
Thy Love thou provest by thy Passion,
Whose every wound with open mouth cries out
We are Loves Vou^hers, if you doubt.
When Heavenly Hoasts first saw thee breath if then
They run and preach good will toward men
If thus they comment on thine Infant-breath
My God! what thought they of thy death!
Oh! how he Loved him? if who saw thee shed
Tears for thy friend Laz'ras bee'ng dead,
Cried out; What might they have said that saw thee dye
Bleeding for me, thine enemy.
And dare I? can I yet renew that grief?
Doubting thy Love, through unbelief.
If I but say I Love, how does it grieve me
If yet my Friend will not believe me.
And dare I yet suspect the God of Love
Who says, who swears, who dies to prove
He Loves me. Shall I fail in proof of mine
And then, to make a mends, doubt thine!
Doubling thereby
Each in^ury?
I find, I feel, I see, and cannot I say,
He Loves me? doubts out of my way.
Doubtings by Demonstrations overcome
Sure then if ever may be dumb.
Or if I needs must doubt and jealous be
Lord I Will suspect my self not thee.
My soul! love thou thy Lord? say yea or nay,
My God I Am gravelled what to say.
Yet will I hold mine heart to the S^rutiny
Till it affirm or else deny
Deny? my God! I dare not, nay I cannot,
And yet, methinks, affirm I may not.
Oh that I could. This only can I say
Dear Lord, that I cannot say nay
Thoughts in again! (Loves no such neutrall thing)
You must a certain Verdict bring.
Only be sure, for it is your own behoof,
Your Verdict stands on certain proof.
Alas my thoughts can never solve this doubt
Unless thy Love Lord help me out.
My God what crowds of witnesses seem strive
To be deposed oth' Negative?
My seldom thoughts of thee, my cold devotions,
Heartless profession, lifeless motions;
My wanton Dalian with the world and sin:
My want of kindness to thy kin:
My little longing when you are out of sight
Or laboring to regain the light,
I sigh to say
How these plead NAY.
These? ah my God! and many more than these;
My little little care, to please;
Or fear, of grieving thee, my want of leisure,
For thee; and in thee, want of pleasure.
My numbe Lethargick zeal when men defame
Thy Saints, thy worship, ways, or name,
How say I that I Love thee, when mine heart
So poorly plays the Lovers part?
My Love commands mine eye, mine hand, my purse
Can I Love thee, yet serve thee worse?
Or must my friend of all friends be denied
What I yield all I Love beside?
Alas! my Lord! such proof had almost got
A Verdict past I Love thee not;
But that one witness came and crossed the rest
Stifling that Verdict in my breast.
Yet it was not much that witness had to say
But sorely weeping cried I pray
If It be as you pretend that there is no fire,
Whence is this smoking flax desire?
My Jesus! you are my Judge, the Judge of all,
To whom my Love must stand or fall
Thou that know all things know that I abhor
My self for Loving thee no more.
My dear! I h've sometime longed, and do I not
Long yet that thou would loose one knot
To tie another? what is this life to me,
If I must still be strange to thee?
To Love is life,
Else life's but strife.
Oh that I were a Graduat in that College
Where Love is known that passes knowledge:
Where smiling Saints do comprehend and dwell
In Love incomprehensible.
Where perfect Love casts out tormenting fear:
Nor theirs nor thine is doubted there:
Where full-eyed Love may see to interline
Thy text with some short Notes of mine.
But whilst I Am low as earth, short as a span,
Fleet as a shade, narrow as man
The height, length, depth, and breadth, of Love to measure
I have nor skill, my God, nor leisure.
Love that is as high as Heaven, for thence it came
And thither with it bound I am.
Love that is as long as length; eternity
Must say how long, for so cannot I.
Love that is as deep as Hell, for thence it took,
Me; And the day's down in my book.
Love that is as broard as sin that spreads all over
Yet, Lord! thy Love my sin does cover.
The Astronomer what houses stars do keep
Can tell, the diver gage the deep;
But I, poor Christs-Cross-Sholler, cannot spell
LOVE, though a monasyllable.
Lord I could be content mine earth might turn
To ashes, so my soul might burn
And all my powers become one Holocaust
Reaching thy Love and life at last;
Lord stir this fire
And raise it higher.
Here Is a poor broken heart, a Sacrifice
Which yet thou'st said thoult not despise
I bind it on thine Altar in desire
Heavens favor set it all on fire!
Lord shall I ever be a Questionist?
Help me commence in Love to Christ:
Or still incept'ring? pass a grace mine heart
May once be master of this art.
But as I said, methought, I heard one say,
Away bold Freshman you must stay
Your time: there is many'n act ere this degree.
And hare there must no hudlings be.
Lord if it must be so, my now Condition.
I tender to thine own Tuition
Till I have better Arguments to prove
I Am more proficient in thy Love.
Charge thy self with me. Me and all that is mine
Subject I to thy discipline,
Lord I will have no mind distinct from thee
Who give all that's thine to me.
If others ask me, can you walk abroad?
I Will answer, Go and ask my God.
Where thou say go though flesh and blood say stay
I Will creep if I cannot run that way.
Or if I, as I fear I shall, transgress
This law of Love I now express;
I Will humbly strip my self next serious thought
Till thou have whipped me for my fau't:
Then kiss thy rod;
And cry, my God!
Then if thou smile thy favor Lord shall be
Like rain upon mown grass to me.
Or like warm Sunbeams that succeed some shower
Till joys poor Bud's a full-blown flower
But I will watch left some Old-Adam seed,
With joys fair flower, put forth some weed.
Which when it first peeps, thy weeding knife I Will borrow
Lest the ground harden by to morrow.
I Will mark thine eye; a better brighter Star,
Than that that guid^ the Mariner.
My dull remisness, Lord, thine eye, shall whet
To more observance, when sharp set.
Thy quick and hasty look shall quicken me:
I Will away to my Book, or Knee.
I Will chide my busy play-fellows; Away,
My master frowns; I dare not play.
Lord, I Will see by thine eyes; thine every beck
Shall be my Bridle curb, and check.
The Watch thou giv'st me I Will keep for thy sake:
And wind it up when ere I wake.
The Book thou gav'st me, that blood-guilded Book,
I Will ever, ever in it look
Till I find thee there, and my self, thy beauty,
And learn to know and do my duty.
Then showing to others, See the token Love
I Will say has sent me from above:
Keeping the cleaner hands that I may not
Discolor it with any spot;
Unless a tear
Drop here or there.
The task thou setst me Lord I Will nor complain:
Thy work shall be my wage and gain:
Clean as I can I Will do it if sullied then
My tears shall wash it ore again.
Thy strict commands and Love-lin'd yoke shall be
A neck-chain of pure gold to me.
Thine hardest sayings when my stomachs que^zie
Love shall digest, and make them easy.
Thine is no Labans-service if it were,
Yet Love two Prentiships might bear:
But to be bound, or held in durance by
Thy Royal Law, is liberty.
Mine heart shall be less loose, and yet more large
Being stretched out unto all thy charge:
And where my life falls short of either table
Love shall fulfill; for Love is able.
If thou will come, and take an Inventory
Of all that's mine; I Will not be sorry:
If thou will search and ransack all I have
I Will help thee, or thine help I Will crave.
If ought I have displease, or if I doubt,
I will, for sureness throw it out.
If I can pleasure thee with ought that's mine:
I Will quit my Title, Lord it is thine.
If mine heart fit thy walking thou shall have it
If not, yet Love shall mend and pave it
With such clear solid stone even all within
As yet can weep for every sin,
Washing thy feet
When men don't see it.
Mine heart being thus possessed, when strangers come
I Will say thou'st taken up my room:
Then if thou ask whose purse, or parts are these
I Will answer, thine Lord if thou please.
If on mine Houre-Glass thou then lay thine hand
And ask whose is this running sand
I Will answer, Lord the little's left is thine:
But what is run out is no more mine.
Or if thou ask me, who are those at the door?
Smiling on them; I Will say, my poor,
I Will draw my soul out when thy Lazar knocks
My Cupboard shall be the poor man's box.
If others come, like those poor Greeks, to me
With a Sir, we would Jesus see
I Will gladly tell them where my Lord does Sup
Do'ng all I can to help them up.
If others curse thee Shimes like; if they
Cast dust, I Will blow the dust away
With sighs and groans; if they thine honor stain
I Will weep and wash it clean again.
Or else I Will chide or fight if thou shall bid
(But first of all with T^ai ours hid
At home) I Will fear no colors whilst above
Thy Banner over me is Love.
Who sues to be a favorite of mine
I Will ask him first if he be thine,
If not, I Will pray him to be reconciled
To thee, that so my Love to the Child
May a^l be found
Thine at the bound.
Or when thy tender Lilly bleeds, my God
Torn with those cru^l^ thorns abroad
Or rent with Schisms at home and heart division
I Will what I can play the Physician.
I Will plead with thee with them; if things grow worse
I Will bleed my self to turn the course
When I thy Peoples Hearts divided see
Surely mine Heart shall broken be.
Thy Love has lent me all the balm that's thine
Why should not then thy sores be mine
My God they shall: but chiefly when my Passion
Or lust provokes thine indignation.
I Will bereveng'd on one, my self I mean,
And grieve till thou art pleased again.
Passions shall live like Gibeonites, their Law
To hew thy wood and water draw.
So all I have shall serve thee till I know
My Love has life and find it grow.
Lord I Will account of all as it conduces
To help Loves growth and serve its uses.
If in the Sunshine of a prosperous state
My fire cannot burn so clear for that.
I Will rather choose some courteous clouds return
Then see Loves holy fire not burn.
Or if I fail of ought I here profess
And thy rod cannot my fault redress
Rather then live thy grief, I Will yield to dye
So Love inflict the penalty.
That paid my score
By death before.
If Love yet let me live a growing debtor
I Will study hard but I Will live better:
Live I mean Love; that is the Commandments en^
And that's the life that I intend.
Though Love wax cold abroad, and sin abound,
Hard Frost ore spreading all the ground.
Shall the heat of Kitchen fire be more increast
And not thy flames within my breast?
Lord what^ a Silver Tongue if it cannot talk
A Golden Leg if 't cannot walk
Faith that can Mountains move when it is desired
Or Martyrdom, if Love be n't fired.
What if I give my goods and all my store,
But not in Love to feed thy poor?
But if in Love a cup of water cold
Though the drink's mean, the cup is Gold.
Love tunes my Prayers, makes Praises Musical:
Which else at best but howl or ball.
Love makes two Mites to God as acceptable
As if to bring two worlds 'twere able.
True Love's true beauty, beauties else but paint
No more am I if Love I want.
Lord help me put on Love to keep me warm:
To dwell in Love secure from harm.
To walk in Love, till Love in the stream do lead
To Love that is the Fountain head
Or the Ocean which if I cant comprehend
I Will plung into: that in the end
Lost I may be,
If lost, in thee.
Yet when I think what pent and narrow room,
In The Virgins Womb,
The God of Love lodged in, methinks mine heart
May hold its part.
Into mine heart O shed thy Love abroad,
My God! my God.
Both being Spirit, what can better suit,
Then the Spirits fruit?
Drink thirsty vessel, till thou fill or break!
But never leak.
The broken Heart, and truly contrite Breast
Holds Love the best:
And the best Love: a Love more worth then wine.
Lord I mean thine:
Then as the purpose of thy Grace and Love
None can remove
Let me So Love thee as to part and lever,
Lord, n ver, never.
Ungirt, Unblest, we say: my God Love is
The bond of B^iss
And perfectness: A Grace, whose Bondmen be
The only free.
Works without Faith can never, Lord, please thee
Nor p^^fi me.
Faith without Love, cannot operate o^ move
But works by Love.
Love is a Grace that stands her ground in Glory
That upper story.
Love, when Tongues, prophecies, and know^edg fail,
Entering the Veil,
Possesses as Supreme and highest Grace
The Holiest place.
When Faith and Hope do thither wait upon her,
As Maids o^ Honor
Sole Love is left as Queen of all the Graces
In Gods Embraces.
Mean while, Lord, to be sick of Love to thee
Is health to me.
They that have not this sickness, h^ve a worse,
^hy plague and curse.
If any man LOVE not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maran-atha,

1 Cor. 16.22. PRAYER.
NExt the Trinity of Persons and of Graces
Man's three main Duties Muse and Method
Who views my God and Grace in all their Beauty places.
Cannot (I should think) but take delight in Duty.
But who believes, Hopes, Loves (I Am sure of that)
Will Love to Pray, to Hear, to Meditate.
Pray'r's the first breath put forth in crying then
When, through sad pangs, poor souls are born again.
Heaven well commends Faiths midwifery, and says,
The Child's no still born, for behold he prays.
Prayer is the rapper at Heavens door: Faith knocks,
Who Is there? says Love within doors, and unlocks.
Prayer is the key: what e're in the lock retards;
Prayer, ^yld with mourning, gently slips the wards,
And moves the Spring, Gods heart: Does Ephraim mourn?
The bolt gives back, Jehovah's bowels turn.
Prayer is an Arrow from a well-bent heart:
Watch the Returns, and see what 'twill impart
Of Heavens Intelligence: in the floods decrease
This mournful Dove brings the Olive branch of peace.
Prayer is the saced Bellows when these blow,
How musically does faiths Organ go;
Thus Prayer proves Faith an Instaument: and Love
Answers to this wind-musick from Above,
In sweet consort, with ravishing consent,
Upon that Lute (that dear string'd Instrument)
Whose strings are Bowels of that Lamb once slain,
Who makes the Music, bee'ng! Alive again.
Prayer is the sacred Bellws, when these blow,
How does that Live-cole from Gods Altar glow!
By Prayer Love burns to zeal: and hot desire
Baptizeth the souls fuel all with fire.
Prayer breath's the gale, whilst Faith does navigate
In The brittle bark of Man's frail mortal state:
Good Hope's the Cape: fair Heaven, and fair wind!
Whilst Faith, in prayer steers the low ballast mind.
Prayer is Faiths Limbeck there the Promise lies
And thence distills: mock not Prayr's watery eyes.
On the knees of Prayer Faith brings forth Promises,
As Bilba sometimes bare on Rachels knees.
Prayer is Faiths Bucket (Prayer does upward move,
Drawing its waters from those wells above)
Chained to that Bucket of the Blessing, so
That that comes down, as this does upward go.
Prayer is Faiths Pump, where't works till the water come
If It come not free at first, Faith puts in some;
Some truly penitential tears: and then
Pumping the Promise, paies it self again.
Prayer is the Christians Pulse: Prayer instantly
The Temper or Distemper will descry.
Some read; some sing and some their prayers can say,
He Is an Elias that his prayers can pray.
Prayer lifting up its holy hands can dart.
To Heaven that hand-granado of the Heart,
Of the whole Heart, which kindled with desire
In fervent motion breaks, sets Love on fire:
Compassions burn^ Heaven, suffering violence,
Grows to surrender unto man, propense.
Pray'r's a chief piece of Faiths Artillery,
Take a right ground, mount Prayer, aim right, let fly:
Does Heaven hold out? let Heaven hear from Faith
What force Prayer home-charg'd with a Promise has.
Does Hell assault? let fervor fire this Gun
And the report shall make bold Legion run.
Prayers Rhetoric commands, when it begs, and so
Makes most victorious whom it brings most low.
Prayer lifts up the Eyes, Hands, Heart we see;
When Prayer most humbly does bow down the knee.
Prayer makes Man Prince with God: Does Jacob kneel,
Says King of Glory, Rise up Israel!
Prayer, in the silent Hannah, loudly Speak^;
Prayer both Manasse's heart, and prison, breaks.
Elijahs Prayer does pierce the brassie skies:
And makes the Tears to stand in Heavens eyes.
It Is not an armed Amalek can stand
When Prayer lifts up a Moses's naked Hand.
As Thunder struck Philistines once did fall,
D^wn tumbles Rain, and the Enemy withal,
At th'Lightning Legions Pray'^. Oh who can war,
Where private Soldiers such Commanders are?
Prayer bee'ng aboard the great Leviathan,
In whose close Cook-room Jonah's shipped, poor man!
Mak^s Land, runs the Hull on shore, and open breaks
The Prisoners way, by blowing-up the Decks.
Prayer undertakes to discipline the SUN:
To teach that Giant Postures, when to Run,
When to Retreat, to make a Halt, to stand:
At praying Joshua's word of Command,
This Rolling Eve, in Heavens Brow stands still;
Wondering to see Faiths Prayer thus work its will.
Fifteen Degrees, when Hezekiah prayed,
His Life, and ten the Sun ran retrograde,
Thus Prayer prevails in Heaven, Earth, and Seas:
Add but its conquest over Hell to these?
How the Air of Prayer choaks the serpentine brood
Of that old crooked Dragon in the flood;
Sin, Satan's spawn, and how the intestine Thorn,
Is by true Prayr's compunction out-worne:
How the Messenger of Satan's buffeted,
Who came to buffet: how the Serpents Head,
Under the knees of Prayer is sqeez'd at last;
And Beel-zebub is himself outcast,
By the rare force of Prayer, that grows more strong
By Fasting, and more fresh by watching long.
The sum of all is Prayers stupendous Art,
To bind Gods hands, and keep in hold his Heart.
Prayer importuning this Sampson has found,
Himself revealing; how he may be bound;
Even God be bound, who is infinitely free,
Yet says to Faith and Prayer Command ye me.
The Prayer-hearing God the Father is:
The Pray'r-perfuming God that Son of His,
(With flagrant, fragrant Incense of His Merit)
The Pray'r-inditing God is God the Spirit.
Prayers Tears are washed in Gods Blood, and its means
Are ayr'd with Gods unutterable groans:
Thus Prayer prevails with God: yet Praises shall
Not Prayer, but the God of Prayer, victorious call,
Who Is All in All.
Pray always with all PRAYER, and watch there unto with all Perseverance,

Ephesians. 6.18. HEARING.
FRom Prayer to Hearing I proceed
For that prepares for this indeed
But who from Hearing turns his ear away
The Lord abominates to hear him pray,
Hark? it is Gods voice: can man forbear
To hear Him speak that made the Ear?
Why should the Head of hearing Ears make show
Since such Deaf Ears upon Man's Heart do grow?
Heaven did to poor Man's misery
Give ear before he gave the Cry.
Methinks a Saviors words should all sound loud,
Acuted with the Accents of his Blood.
What vile Dishonesty appears
By Man's disgraceful loss of Ears?
And y^^ let Sirens frog, and Satan knock;
(...) Hear can (...) too ^ight, too soon unlock;
No Cords can hold, or Lusts be bound,
Till All is overboard and drowned.
When th'Serpent charms this Add^r hears, but when
Heaven charm's more wisely, the Ears are charmed again.
Most what I see a monstrous sight
Most have two Ears, yet neither's Right,
God gave them two, yet they will by no means lend
So much as one to such a bounteous Friend.
Sure such a Friend would soon repay,
By giving ear to what they pray.
God ever takes up Ears on Interest,
And does his greatest Creditors pay best.
They teach their very Ears to pray
Who listen well what God shall say.
The uncircumsised in Ear bid God deny,
Refusing Him that speaks, when they cry.
The Deaf Ear'd-Idoll is abhord
And Men like Idols, of the Lord:
Who deafness plagues with deafness, and does turn
His Ear from Dives whilst his Tongue does burn.
Lord therefore to Deaf Hearers give
To live to hear, to hear and live.
Yea into the Harvest send forth Laborers
To fill thy floor by gathering in of Ears.
Thou sow'st thy Word as Seed, and then,
It Is fit thou reap the Ears of Men,
As Mary weeping heard till showrs of tears,
Full ripe for thine own reaping made her Ears.
What Heaps shall in thy Garnets be
When Ears are Circumcised by Thee?
Fair Sion shall be like an heap of Wheat
That round about with Lillies is beset.
When Malchus lost an Ear thy touch
(A Saviors skill and virtue's such)
R^pair'd that Loss: Lord it is but Ask and Have:
Thou can find Ears in Lazarus his Grave.
Thou David's Heir of David's Keys
Can shut and open as thou please,
Thy still voice loud winds, and proud waves obey;
Unto thy Word, let not Men's Ears say Nay.
Thou did a Prisoner once impow'r
( Judge Felix bee'ng Auditour)
To give the Charge that took the Judge by the Ear
More Bonds did then on the Bench then Bar appear.
When Heavens great Guns from tire to tire,
According to thy Word give fire
Kadesh does tremble: Hindes do calve for fear:
The howling Deserts, and deaf Rocks give ear.
And is Mars Heart more wild? more hard?
More full of noises? stronger barred?
Yet is the star the keyhole: Lord put in
Thy finger, then the gentlest word will win.
All turns and moves: One Eph^phatha.
Removes obstructions out of the way;
Then the Ear shall welcome every second word
Wi^h a Come in thou Blessed of the Lord!
The Scriptures speak of the Learned Ear;
S^^^ then thy tongue must teach to hear,
Morning by morning let thy Music make
The heavy Ears of Man's dull mind to wake.
If Sons of God, fair Angels, stand
Waiting the Son of Gods command,
(Which when it comes, who sees these Holy things,
Might see their Ears converted into wings)
If the Deaf Devil lends an Ear
Not led by Love but forced by Fear
And if the sworn, plague, famine only know
By harkening to his Word they Come and Go;
In vain does poor Man stop his Ear
And say in's Heart He Will never hear:
Harvests bring Ears: and such is the Worlds end:
Graves must find Hearers then; The Dead attend.
Then Happy He that sooner heard,
Hearing before for afterward;
God had his Ears on Earth, and doubtless He
Shall with full sheaves repaid in Heaven be.
If Sol'mons servants were so blessed
That coun'd their Lesson from his breast,
How Happy're those Disciples then whose Ears
Are tuned to the true Music of the Spears?
Where the First-Mover is Free Grace,
Free Purpose moves in the second place:
Third Orbe's the Word of Grace in which do shine
As many Stars as Promises Divine
These Lessons so Divine, so good
(The Orbs bee'ng Oiled in Saviors blood)
Do so divinely correspond, that so
Needs must the Hearer the Diviner grow.
Then comes that holy Turtle Dove,
Gently descending from above;
And stealing through the Earth-hole into the heart,
Does Heavens Intelligence on Earth impart.
This is a joyful sound indeed
What Halcyon days shall hence succeed,
Whilst Thunders terror makes Deaf Rebels quail,
Christ^ voice to his Disciples is All hail!
If God that rules all otherwhere
Love so to move the Orb of the Ear,
Sure then the Blessed of the Lord are they
That Hearing hearken, Hearkening that Obey.
The Humble Hearer may invite
God Guest-wise to a Disht Delight
A fervent whole-broke-heart served up in Tears
The Bread bee'ng made oth' Contrite hearers Ears.
Nay God invites Himself to sup
Where such delights are so served up
By a clean hand, whereth' ear and the heart's kept hot
God is Man's Guest, and Heaven will pay the shot
A letter H is not say we
Let HEARING then mine EARING be.
Thou God of Israel bore thy servants Ear,
That I in i^ this Jewel still may wear.
Let every one be swift to HEAR. But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers
only, deceiving your own Souls,

Jam. 1.21, 22. MEDITATION.
I come to sing the last but not the least,
Being that that Clencheth in man's mind and breast
Those Nails the Assemblies Masters drive
Not to eat but to Digest, makes thrive.
Sweet, sacred thing! Caelestiall Contemplation!
Old Enochs Trade, young Isaac^ Recreation.
That furnishest Man's thoughtfull breast
With Greatest Work, and Sweetest Rest.
Israel's sweet Singer used when first awake,
His Lark-like Rise, upon thy wings, to take;
With which, he made his morning-flight:
Of which, his Feather-bed at night.
The nimble Lifeguard of that Royal mind,
Were Thoughts, by thee divinely Disciplined:
Marshalled in each days front and rear,
Greatness thus guarded know's no fear.
When anxious Musings would invade that soul;
When Cares would clog, or make it stomack-foul,
Thou did exo^erate, Thy skill,
Did still prepare the Stomack-pill.
Thy Physic having wrought; and hungry health
Thine hopeful Patient re-surpriz'd by stealth
Then thou that honeycomb did drain;
And break the Bone, that did contein
The fat, the sweet, which from the Promise flow's
(Whereof the sensual worldling nothing knows)
Thus Meditation first sets right
Then sa^iat's the souls Appetite.
Man's fed with Manna; void of surfets fear:
Where Meditation's Cook, Digestions clear:
Mortals, thus fed with Angels fare;
Converted into Angels are.
By Contemplation was that Darling dressed,
When Guest-wife Heaven bad him to a feast.
John's clothed in spirit, when they call
To keep the Lords days festival.
In Contemplations Mount who dwell, can stretch
Their hand to Heaven that Starry Crown to reach:
And dress themselves in that bright Sun
Whilst under-foot they tread the Moon.
In Contemplations Pisgah they, that have
At once a view of Canaan, and their grave.
(In this worlds Desert wearied)
Do willingly undress to Bed.
Sweet sacred Meditation! may I be
Wrought, recreated, guarded thus by thee:
Physick'd and fed by thy Dispensatory:
By thee be dressed with Grace, prepared for glory.
I.
Then learn O man! to part betwixt
Dead earth and the earth wherewith thou're mint:
Sure walls of ^lay may higher rise,
Then what in earths ^ead dungeon lies.
The Soul with Earth's already clad,
Earth upon earth would make more sad.
Shall wings make massy Mountains fly?
Shall hands stitch Earth unto the sky?
Then dung-bill dro^es scale Heaven may,
And Muck-worms creep in the Milkie way.
To carry Earth to Heaven some think:
But must Earth rise? or Heaven sink?
Nor Earth nor Heaven must be their prize;
But a fools (Mah'mets) Paradise.
If yet thine Earth to Earth adhere,
Then let the Dead the Dead interre;
If thou cannot lift the inferior part;
Yet, as Gods Offering, heave thine heart.
Thy Body's but thy Beast, and sure
All else is but its furniture:
Leave then thy heavy jade below,
Up to the place that God shall show.
Earth's ever moving to Earths Center;
Man's for a more sublime Advent'r:
It Is pity Dust in the Air or Eye
Should hinder a Celestial spy.
With lumbering Body leave behind?
The low, the ignoble, servile mind:
Such men I mean as cannot out-pass
Old Abrah'ms servants, or his Ass,
The secret secker only knows
What secrets Heaven can disclose.
Gods Holy of Holies still shuts out
The vulgar and unholy rout.
In secret places of the stairs
And clefts of Rocks lie mine Affairs.
Angels will scarce in crowds appear.
We say The few'r the better cheer.
If busy Ants of molehill birth
Promiscuously converse on Earth,
Let the Highborn Bird of Paradise
Scorning the Earth, still scale the skies.
An Ant-hill and Exchange agree,
Save, Men the greater Trifters be,
Thus mortals toil to live below,
Whilst Man by toil to Heaven might go.
What though thou've been shor^-winded? sure
Heavens hill can Earths green sickness cure.
Or what needst dread the journeys length,
Whilst all along thy way's thy strength?
II.
BEe'ng thus Ascended, Bind and slaughter
Thy fin, thine Only Child of laughter,
In this Mount God will soon be seen
If some Dear sin don't intervene;
Dear sin indeed? whilst Angels sect
Their first Estates for it and Hell.
Dear sin! whilst for its bu^ks men do
Fair Heavens houshold-bread forgo.
A present flash, and future flame
Is the best Income sin can name.
'Twas sin eclipsed the Angels Crown,
And what brought them, will keep thee, down.
Man do not see how Cherubs stand
With flaming swords on every hand,
From rape of such to guard Life's Tree
As of dead works the workers be?
Ah! guilty soul, dare look abroad,
Or unagreed dare walk with God?
To reconcile dare thou aspire
Thy dross with that consuming fire?
Sure such Atonement shall begin,
When sin proves grace, or grace proves sin.
Since Earth's too dead, too dark, too low;
Sure Hell to Heaven shall never go.
III.
BEe'ng thus far onward in this steep,
Would further climb? then learn to creep.
Who try can tell the Ascents like these
Are the best s^al'd on the hands and knees.
Angels first rose, then fell; and so
By growing too high, became so low.
But Christ did raise his Royal Crest
By building such a lowly nest,
The Pharisee that nothing knows
Of the true Temple, boldly goes
Into its shadow there to boast
Reckoning proud fool without his Host.
The Publican does smite upon
His Heart, as if 'twere made of stone:
Which stone despised thought 't lay below
Did to a Temple sooner grow.
Unto Gods Altar nakedness
God suffers to have no access:
The indowments of men's minds we call
Their parts, importing therewithal,
No man of parts can decent be
Unless clothed with humility,
The Highest to the low gives grace:
Who veil their own shall see his face*
In dust and ashes self abhorred
Are the accepted of the Lord.
Most flaring fair faced Dinas are
Sooner undone for being fair:
The veiled Rebekah Isaac takes,
And his dear bosom-consort makes.
How can a near acquaintance grow?
Whilst God proud hear^s far off does know
Proud hearts know not themselves and then
Sure Heaven must needs be out o^ ken.
Whilst the void Air and worthless wind
Brooks no way to be down confined,
Earthquakes must all things overthrow
Rather than empty Air keep low;
Gems, Jewels; India's Treasures dwell
In meanest Caverns low roof'd Cell.
Thus from the pots the Lord does take
And into Crowns his Treasures make.
Would then be profited by me
From earth, sin, and proud self get free.
Yet it is a Trinity indeed
After the which with winged speed
I would pursue, and ever may
Both body, soul, and spirit pray.
He whom I seek, and ever shall
Is THREE, and ONE: And ONE and ALL.
MEDITATE upon these things, give thy self wholly to them, that thy proffiting
may appear to all,

1 Timothy 4.51. FINIS.
