The Tyranny of Tyrannies.
THese are to signify to all freeborn English men, That the new Turkish
Tyrants, Cromwell and Ireton, at a Council of War, have already privately
condemned to death Sir WILLIAM WALLER and Major General BROWN, Members of
Parliament, free men of England, men that have faithfully fought the Battles of
their Country in order to their Countries Peace, not their own Tyranny and
Dominion over the people; One of them a Sheriff of the City of London, in
whose blood they will write their own victory, and the City's slavery: Neither
of whom being under any Jurisdiction of Martial Law. Whereby other men may well
foresee, this shall be a leading Precedent for many thousands more to follow.
And this is done, they never having been heard, sent for, or any evidence
produced against them. And it is resolved, their heads shall be cut off before
Saturday next, to strike a terror into the whole Kingdom, that no man may
oppose their Tyranny. Of which we thought good to give you notice, that all men
may assist these condemned Gentlemen with their prayers; in whose veins the
Religion, Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom lie bleeding, unless the whole
Kingdom as one man rise up against these bloody Tyrants, and shake off their
yoke before it be settled. Cromwell and Ireton have lately found out a new
Anabaptisticall light or Principle to act these Tragedies upon the lives of
innocent men: That though they have no proofs nor evidence, yet if they think
in their consciences they are guilty, they may condemn them out of the
testimony of their own private consciences.

GENESIS 49. 5, 6.
Simeon and Levi are brethren, instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.
O my soul, come not thou into their secret: unto their assembly, mine honor,
be not thou united; for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will
they dug down a wall.
