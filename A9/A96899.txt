THE SENTENCE FROM SCRIPTVRE AND REASON, AGAINST ARCHBISHOPS and Bishops with
their Curats.

I. That they are, in their Doctrine and Practices, Abominable. II. That their
Government is an Abomination. III. That their Service is a Profanation, so
provoking in Gods eyes, that He will have all removed out of His sight. IV.
That Newtrality is most detestable, and commands a curse from God and good Men.
V. That the two ways of Government, the Presabiteriall and Independent, are
but in show two; they go cross a little, but they will bend each to other till
they shall both meet in one Church Way.
Wherein, they, who walk with a right foot, stand charged to watch-over each
other in their way; To give an account of their way; To bear each others
burden; To supply each others wants, To partake of each others graces, To do
all things as becomes a Communion of Saints, always doing or receiving good.
This is the excellent way, as disagreeing with our Times, and ways, as new
wine and old bottles.

Therefore the Reader will see his engagement here, to walk after inward
gracious principles, rather then to swerve after outward privileges. He may
consider also whether the Enquiry be, what way of Government is fittest for
select and choice congregations, culled out two or three from amidst thousands:
or what way of Government is meet for those thousands in Israel.

Presented to the, Assembly of DIVINES.

An high way there and away, it shall be called the way of Holiness, the
unclean shall be not pass over it.

Isa. 35. 8. Printed in the year, Anno Dom. 1644.
