What passed the next day, when His Majesty delivered His Answer.
WHich was read by the Earl of Holland to the rest of the Committee; And that
being done, his Lordship endeavored to persuade His Majesty to come near the
Parliament: Whereunto His Majesty answered, I would you had given me cause; but
I am sure this Declaration is not the way to it. And in all Aristotle's
Rhetoricks there is no such Argument of persuasion. The Earl of Pembroke
thereupon telling Him that the Parliament had humbly besought His Majesty to
come near them aforesaid: His Majesty replied, He had learnt by our
Declaration, that words were not sufficient. His Majesty being then again moved
by the said Earl of Pembroke to express what He would have said: He would whip
a Boy in Westminster School, that could not tell that by His Answer: And
further said, They were much mistaken, if they thought His Answer of that, a
denial. And being also asked by the said Earl of Pembroke, Whether the Militia
might not be granted, as was desired by the Parliament for a time. His Majesty
swore, by God, not for an hour; you have asked that of me in this, was never
asked of a King, and with which I will not trust my Wife and Children.

His Majesty said, The business of Ireland will never be done in the way that
you are in, Four hundred will never do that Work: It must be put into the hands
of One. If I were trusted with it, I would pawn my Head, to end that Work. And
though I am a beggar my Self, yet (speaking with a strong asseveration) I can
find Money for that.

FINIS.
