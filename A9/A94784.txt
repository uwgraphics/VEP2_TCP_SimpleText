The Tragedy of Hero and Leander: OR, The Two Unfortunate Lovers.
Famous Leander for his love renowned,
In crossing of the Hellespont was drowned,
And Hero when his corpse she once e^py'd,
She leapt into the waves, and with him died.
To a pleasant new Tune, Or, I will never love thee more.


COme mournful muse assist my quill,
whilst I with grief relate,
A story of two Lovers true,
cut off by cruel fate:
Death only parts, united hearts,
and brings them to their graves,
Whilst others sleep within the deep,
or perish in the waves.
Leander on the bay of bliss,
Pontus, he naked stood;
In passion of delay he sprang,
into the fatal flood.
The rageing seas, none can appease,
his fortune ebbs and flows,
The heaven down showers, and rain down powers,
and the wind aloft it blows.
The Lad forsook the Land, and did
unto the Gods complain.
You Rocks, you rugged Waves,
you Elements of Hail and Rain,
What it is to miss, true Lovers bliss,
alas you do not know,
Make me a wrack as I come back,
but spare me as I go.
Behold on yonder tower, see where,
my fair beloved lies
This the appointed hour, hark how
she on Leander cries;
The Gods were mute, unto his suit,
the billows answered, No;
The surges rise, up to the skies,
but he sunk down below.
Sweet Hero like Dame Venus fair
all in her Turrit stood,
Expecting of her Lover dear,
who crossing was the Flood:
A feeble light, through darksome night,
she set her Love to guide:
With waveing arms, and loves Alarms,
with a voice full loud she cried.

YOu cruel waves some pity show,
unto my dearest friend;
And you tempestuous winds that blow,
at this time prove ^ore kind:
O waft my love secure to shore,
that I his face may see;
With tears your help I do implore
your pity lend to me.
Let each kind Dolphin now befriend,
and help my love along;
And bring him to his iourneys end
before his breath is gone;
Let not a wave become his grave,
and p^rt us both for ever;
Pity my grief, send him relief,
and help him now or never.
The fierce and cruel tempest did
most violently rage;
Not her laments nor discontents
its fury could assuage;
The winds were high and he must dye,
the fates did so ordain;
It was design^d he never should find
his dearest Love again.
She spread her silken vail for to
secure the blazing light,
To guide her Love, least on the Rocks
his wearied limbs should smite:
But cruel fate it proved his (...),
and caused him to sleep;
She from above, beheld her love
^lye drowned in the deep.
Her show^y eyes with tears brought in
the tide before its time;
Her sad lamenting grows likewise
unto the skys did clime:
O Heavens (quoth she) against poor me
do you your forces b^nd;
Then from the Walls in haste she (...)
to meet her dying friend.
Her rew^ed^ w^d arms about,
his senceless co^^s she clipps,
And many kisses spent in vain
upon his dying ^ipps:
Then waved her hands, unto the Lands,
singing with d^ing pride;
Go tell the World in billows strong,
I wi^h my Love have died.
Thus did they both their breath resign,
unto the will of fate;
And in the deep embrace and twine,
when Death did end their date:
Let Lovers all example take,
and evermore prove true,
For Hero and Leanders sake,
who bids you all adieu.
