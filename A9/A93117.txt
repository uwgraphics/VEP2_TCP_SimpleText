SINCERITY AND HYPOCRICY. OR, The Sincere Christian, and Hypocrite in their
lively Colors, standing one by the other. Very profitable for this Religion
Professing time. By W. S. Sergeant at Law.

Together with a Tract annexed to prove; That true Grace does not lie so much
in the Degree, as in the Nature of it.

Joh. 1. 47. Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no gaile.

Romans 2. 29. He is a Jew which is one inwardly and Circumcision is that of the
heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of
GOD.

To all that pretend in any form of Worship to call on the Name of the Lord.
Friends,
I Having had cause my self to suspect mine own condition, have been put to
search and try my self, and not willing to be mistaken in a point of so high
concernment, I did lay and bind up together these Meditations (tending to the
anatomizing, and the turning of the inside outward of a Christian) to be as a
Looking-glass or Touchstone for my help herein. And finding them somewhat
useful for mine own purpose, and supposing they may be so also to some others
in my case; And having vehement cause to suspect, that many thousands amongst
us in this golden time, go with the wind and tide in the general profession of
the Gospel, and know not (because they try not) what they are, or whither they
are going, or what they do: Therefore I have sent it amongst you as a
watchword. And now consider, were there any one amongst you to have a goodly
Manor in a remote country for which he has a conveyance for the payment down
of a little sum of money, and is to go shortly thither to show his conveyance,
pay his money, and take his possession: And should I tell him his couveyance
has a flaw in it, and this is to be helpen before he go, and that the money he
iutends to carry will not pass for current there; will he not be willing to
hear and receive advice from me? To this purpose is all this that I am saying;
That your Evidence as it now stands is not good for Heaven, the money you
intend to carry with you, that you have to lay down for Christ, will not be
taken for current there. If I should tell any of you that are trading with your
whole stock, whether you shall thrive or not, or that you are in the way to be
undone, and how you may thrive and be exceeding rich: Or if I should tell you
that are now going a voyage by Sea in a Ship, wherein you adventure your lives
and all your estate in a dangerous passage between Rocks and Sands: Or you that
are going about a work of mighty concernment, in a journey by land, in a
solitary way, where are Robbers, Lions, Bears, Wolves, Brakes, Pits, etc. and
there is but one way of safety only, and that you are in the dangerous way,
and should offer to put you in the safe way: Or if I should tell any of you
that stand to be chosen to a place of Preferment, that the having of it will
make him, and the losing of it will undo him, that he is out of the way for
it, and which way he may be sure of it, who would not hearken to me? How
acceptable would my conusel be to such? My design therefore in this word of
Advice is, to show you how amongst all your gettings you may get wisdom Prove.

; and to put you into the narrow way to eternal life, which so few find, and so
many are mistaken in, who then would not but hearken to it? who would but be at
the cost and pains to buy and read it? And now if any one by the reading hereof
shall find himself to be mistaken and out of the right way, it will be his
advantage to be guided into it: It is better to run again than to run amiss,
Melius est recurrere quam male currere.
and to begin all again than to end that which being ended will be to no
purpose. And for others that are in the right way, albeit they may be hereby

is a piece of another man's, an Addition to the fourth chapter of the Book; for
the further clearing of this point; That true Grace does not lie in the degree
or quantity, but in the nature and quality. And it is like to the man, learned
indeed. All the defects and mistakes of my part of the work, must be imputed to
me and the Printer. All the good of it (if any be therein) must be attributed
much of it to other men, some living, some dead, from whom I borrowed it. But
(be it whose it will) if you get any good by it; give to God the glory, for to
him it does belong; And look on me as a poor well wisher to all that enquire
what they may do to be saved.

CHAP. 1.
What Sincerity is, and what Hypocrisy is. The Nature of them.

OUr work being to show to man his uprightness toward God. Job. 33. 23. And
therein to show the right way to Salvation, and to unmark the Hypocrite, we
shall for the doing hereof observe this method. We shall first of all for a
groundwork or Foundation, lay down what sincerity, and what hypocrisy in men
professing Religion are, the nature of them, and who is the sincere Man, and
who is the Hypocrite, and the several kinds of Hypocrisy and Hypocrites; and
wherein Sincerity and Hypocrisy consist; and this in a way of Explication. And
then in the second place, we shall make some kind of inferences thereupon. In
which we shall set forth these things: 1. How far the Hypocrite may go in the
way with the true Christian toward Heaven. 2. What is lacking in the
Hypocrite, wherein he and the true Christian differ, the Hypocrite does come
short, and the true Christian does go beyond him. 3. The signs or degrees of
Sincerity. 4. Motives or Encouragements to it. 5. The signs or degrees of
Hypocrisy. 6. Arguments to persuade against it. 7. And in the last place we
shall add some other things. And all this in a way of Application.

We shall begin with the first, and open the nature of Sincerity and Hypocrisy
together.

Sincerity what. Sincere man who.
Sincerity is that holy Frame of soul, wrought in it by Gods spirit, whereby
the soul stands right to God in its purpose and endeavor to understand his
mind from his word, that thereby it may exactly please him in all things which
he requires therein. And such a heart wherein this Sincerity is, is called a
right heart, Acts 8. 21. Psalm. 51. 10. a whole heart, Psalm. 9. 1. 119. 2. a
perfect heart, 1 Kings 11. 4. 15. 14. etc. A pure heart, Psalm. 24. 4. Mat. 5.
8. and a single heart, Ephesians. 6. 5. And he that has such a heart, we call the
true or Sincere Christian, or the Christian indeed, Ioh. 1. 47.

The Nature of Sincerity.
To open this a little. This Sincerity lies within: it is a heart work, or
business in the Soul, wherein the spirit of God does dwell. And therefore it
is set forth in Scripture by the Metaphor of the Root of a Tree, Mat. 13. 21.
or Foundation of a building, Mat. 7. 24. It is a frame of the heart, it spreads
it self through the whole heart or Soul, understanding, conscience, will, and
affections. And there is an habitualnesse, and constant tenor and temper in it.
And it is such a thing, as like a spring that runs, it streams and makes them
relish of it: does run into all the motions and operations of the Soul and
body, called by one the proper quality of our obedience (if it may be said to
be a grace of it self, and not a thing that does mingle it self with all
graces, and (as one calls it) the Spiritual tune of all the graces in the
Soul) it is then certainly a grace made up of many spiritual and choice
graces, like as was the holy oil powered on the head and garments of the
Highpriests, compounded and made up of many precious Ingredients. For it must
spring from the new life of the new Creature (the Soul whereof is Christ)
which has within it, and must include Faith, love, and the rest of the Graces
that accompany salvation. For it must flow from the pure and even workings of
the internal Principles toward their ends. And therefore if a man act never
so much in duties, and have not a divine Spiritual Spring, a heart impulsed,
and moved by Gods spirit acting in it: If there be not an acting of all the
graces together in a harmony purely and really toward God, this Sincerity is
not there. 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2. etc.

We call it the work of the Spirit, and, so it must needs be, for as the
natural life of the body springs from the Soul within; so all the life of
grace in the Soul, springs from the spirit of Christ within the Soul. Ioh. 6.
63.

We say the work begins with a mind savingly enlightened by the Word and Spirit
of God. James 3. 17. Prove. 17. 2. Ephesians. 1. 18, 19. Psalm. 36. 10. Mat. 11. 25.
For without knowledge the heart cannot be good, and without this there can be
no Faith, no foundation of any Sincerity, nor any thing wherein, or whereby it
may show it self. And therefore when the Apostle Phil. 1. 9. 10. prays for
the Philippians, that they might be sincere, he begins with this, And thus I
pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all
judgment, that ye may approve things that are excellent, that ye may be
sincere etc. So that the Sincere Christian is not only true, cordial and real
in what he thinks, says and does, but that which he thinks, says and
does, is generally according to the truth of the Gospel, Gal. 6. 16. And, as
many as walk according to this rule, etc. 3 Ioh. 4. 2 Ioh. 3. 4. I rejoiced
greatly that I found of thy Children walking in truth, as we have received a
commandment, etc. Coll. 1. 13 2, 3, 4. 5. For otherwise, let what will be
done, and let a man act in what he does never so much ex animo from his very
heart, and sincerely according to the light he has received (as many do upon
false Principles) yet may he be called an Hypocrite.

Who were such.
By the Sincere Christian therefore throughout this Work, we understand such a
one as the Scripture notes Nathaniel to be, Io. 1. 47. Behold a true Israelite
indeed in whom is no guile. And such were David, 1 Kings 11. 4. Ps: 78. 72
Josiah, 2 Kings 23 25. Hezekia, 2 Chronicles. 29 2. Abraham, Genesis 17. 1. and 24. 40.
2 Kings 22. 2. Asa, 2 Chronicles. 20. 32. 1 Kings ^1 14. Job, Job. 1. 1. and 2. 3.
Noah, Genesis 6 9. Iehosaphat, 2 Chronicles. 20 32. Paul after his conversion, and the
rest of the Apostles, 2 Cor. 1. 12. 6. 20. Acts 24. 16. Ab^l, Genesis 4. 4. 5.
Heb: 11. 4. and others, whose Sincerity is thus described: of some of them,
That their hearts were perfect with the Lord: of others that they did that
which was right in the sight of the Lord: of others, That they walked with God:
of others that they walked before God: of others, that they did turn to the
Lord with all their heart, with all their Soul, and with all their might: of
others. That they labored to keep their Consciences void of offense. etc.

And these kind of men in Scripture language, are sometimes called Holy men,
or Saints, Psalm, 37. 14, 28. Sometimes wise men, Mat. 25. 1. 2. Mat. 7.
Sometimes perfect men, Genesis 6 9. Sometimes upright men, Psalm. 37. 14, 18, 37.
Sometimes righteous Men, Psalm. 37. 14, 16. Sometimes just Men, Genesis 6. 9.
Sometimes plain men, Genesis 25. 27. 11. 14. Sometimes innocent men, Mat. 10. 16.
Sometimes the true worshippers that worship God in Spirit and Truth, Io. 4. 23.
Sometimes such as love the Lord Jesus in Sincerity, Ephesians. 6. 24. Sometimes the
pure in heart, Math. 5. 8. Psalm. 24. 4. Sometimes the undefiled, Psalm: 119. 1,
3. Sometimes the poor and needy, Mat. 5. 3. 7. Psalm. 37. 14. Sometimes good
men, Psalm. 37. 14, 23. For the Sincere Christian is a complete Christian, Coll:
2. 10. 4. 12. A perfect and entire Christian, James 1. 4. Heb. 13. 21. And he
that wants one grace, or one grace in truth, wants all grace. That known
position in Ethiques, Quod virtutes sunt connexae, is as true in Divinity as
Morality; so that he that has not all, has indeed none at all; and hence it
is, that true blessedness is annexed to one of them. Mat. 5. 3. Bles-sed are
the poor in spirit, etc. And the sincere Christian is more or less all this,
Holy, Wise, Just, Righteous, etc. So that by this work, we shall see (as in a
glass) as well who is the Holy, Just, and Righteous man, as who is the Sincere
man.

This Sincerity now, and the Sincere man, are opposed to Hypocrisy and the
Hypocrite. And that they may more lively appear in their colors, we shall set
them the one beside the other, and in the next place, give a description of
Hypocrisy and the Hypocrite.

Hypocrisy, What. Hypocrite, Who.
Hypocrisy is an evil frame of Spirit, whereby a man would seem to be right
toward God, and to be carried to act really for him, but in truth it is not
so. Or where a man pretends to more good toward God or Men, without, then is
within him, or whereby he would seem to himself or others to be better then he
is. He that has this heart, is said to have a heart and a heart, or a double
heart, Psalm. 12. 2. James 1. 8. A crooked heart, or perverse heart, Prove. 12 8.
and a divided heart, Hosea 10. 2. 7. 14. And he that has such a heart, is he
we intend by, and call the Hypocrite.

The Nature of Hypocrisy:
But to open this Hypocrisy, and the nature of it, and to show who we mean by
this Hypocrite; we are to know first of all: that Hypocrisy stands in
opposition to the Truth and reality of a thing, and it stands also in
opposition to the Sincerity of a man's intention in the thing, and so Hypocrisy
may be with reference to either of these. 2. By the Hypocrite in general we
do not intend one that appears worse then he is indeed, as Peter did when he
denied his Lord' (which yet he did not without Hypocrisy, being so well
acquainted with him) Nor by the Hypocrite do we intend, one that acts this
part for once, or is deceitful in one thing as Peter, and some others with him
were, Gal. 2. 3, 14. And as the best men sometimes may be, and are unfainedly
sorry for the same afterward. Nor do we intend by the Hypocrite in general,
such a man, as by humane frailty only falls into lesser sins, Romans 7. 17,
19 For in many things we offend all, James 3. 2. And there is not a man that
lives, and sins not, 1 Kings 8. 47. 1 Io. 1. 7, 8. Deuteronomy. 32. 5. Nor do we
hereby intend him, that by strength of Temptation may fall into greater sins
against his purpose, whereof he does afterward repent, as David, Solomon,
Peter, and others did, and the best of Gods own people may do. For as a man
may be in some Acts without Hypocrisy, and yet be an Hypocrite: so a man may
be Hypocritical in some Acts, and yet be sincere; and there is some Hypocrisy
in the best, who at one time or other, or in some things, may appear better
then they are.

3. But by the Hypocrite we mean him, that is an Hypocritie through his heart
and life, one that for holiness and goodness, seems to others, and perhaps
also to himself, to be what he is not, but yet ought to be; or one that
desires to make a fair show without, of that goodness and holiness, which he
has not, nor any root or foundation of, within him. He is one that seems to
be, and to act the part of a true Christian, but is none; he appears in the
shape of a living Christian, but is dead, Rev. 3. 1. Thou have a name to live,
but art dead. Romans 2. 28. He is not a Jew that is one outwardly. He does seem
to be a Saint or Angel of Light, and is a Devil, Io. 6. 70. 2 Cor. 11. 14.
Hence it is that Hypocrites are compared to Tares, which are like to Wheat
Matthew 13. 25. As Hypocrisy is compared to Leaven, Luke 12. 1. which cannot be
known by sight, so the Hypocrite is compared to a wolf in a sheeps skin: Mat.
7. 15. For the likeness and agreement that is in appearance between him and the
true Christian, for they are indeed very hardly to be known the one from the
other. And the Hypocrite having something done upon, and in him, like to the
work of Regenaration wrought upon, and in the elect of God, he calls
himself, and is called by others, by the name of them that are regenerate, 1
Pe. 1. 23. Being borne again, not of corruptible seed, etc. Rev. 2. 9. Which
call themselves Jews, etc. Esaias 48. 1, 2, 3. etc. Which are called by the name
of Israel, etc. And hence it is that Hypocrites are called false brethren of
the true Christians, Psalm. 69. 8. 2 Cor. 11. 26. Gal. 2. 4. False Apostles, and
false Prophets, Mat. 24. 24. 2 Cor: 11. 13. Rev. 2. 2. And as they are amongst,
so they are said to be of the people of God, Acts 20. 30. 1 Ioh. 2 18, 19. The
Hypocrite he looks a great deal better then he is, he promises much more then
he does perform, for his best side is without, Mat: 6. 2. 23. 27. 26. 14. 15.
21, 22, 23, 24, 25. He is like to an Apple, all fair without but quite rotten
within. But the best side of the Sincere man is within, Psalm. 45. 13. He is all
glorious within, Cant. 1. 5. Or he is the same within and without, Psalm. 37.
30, 31. His mouth speaks wisdom, etc. The Law of God is in his heart, etc.
Hence it is that the Hypocrite is compared to a painted Sepulcher or wall, Mat.
23. 27. Act. 23. 3. To a Cloud without water, carried about with every wind,
Iud. 12. which notes his unconstancy, for he is unstable in all his ways,
James 1. 8. And to a wandering star. Jude 13. that makes as fair a show, and
promises as much by its influences, as the fixed star does. So he seems to
promise much to God and Man, and performs nothing, makes a fair show for a
time, and then vanishes away, and comes to nothing, Hosea 6. 4. Your goodness
is as the morning clowd, and as the early dew it goes away, Mat. 13. Hence it
is he is compared in Scripture, to a deceitful Bow, Hosea 7. 16. and in our
common comparison, to Rowers in the Boat, whiles in their pretense they look
one way, in their intents they go the clean contrary way; or like to an Eagle
that soars high toward Heaven, that he may have the more advantage upon his
prey upon the Earth, on which his eye is fixed.

The parts of Hypocrisy. Or wherein it shows it self.
So the Hypocrites work lies in two things. 1. In the Simulation of good, that
he may counterfeit and feign that which indeed is not, that he may make show
of that good which he has not at all, or else not in that measure he makes
show of, being especially swayed with the sinister respects of gain and glory:
And so his main study is, that he may seem better then he is, and that he may
seem to do better then he does.

2. In Dissimulation, which is either of evil or of good, in dissembling and
concealing that which indeed is evil; so his maine care is, that he may not
appear to be so bad as he is, and to do so bad as he does. And this
dissembling and concealing of evil, is threefold. 1. Of evil in doing, he
hides that which he is in doing, with a pretense of doing the quite contrary:
So Herod his intent of the Murder, with pretense of the worship of Christ;
Absalon his Treason, with the Religion of a vow; Judas his Covetousness, with
the show of liberality to the poor; and the Jews their envy to Christ, with a
show of duty to Caesar 2. He dissembleth that which he is about to do. So
Haman Ester 5. 10. refrained himself, and concealed his malice and mischief
intended to the Jews. And the Gibeonites, Josh. 9. 4. 3. He labors to
conceal that which is already done, as the Harlot, Prove. 3. 19, 20. 2. The
dissembling of good is when we conceal and smother the good that is in us, for
some advantage to our selves. So the Corinthians 1 Cor. 10. 19. went to the
Jews feasts for the company of their friends. And so Peter did Judaize, Gal. 2.
12. out of fear to offend, and desire to please other men. So that we say,
that he is an Hypocrite not only that makes a seeming outward show of what he
has not, but also that has a true show of what indeed there is not. The sin
of the Hypocrite is therefore not a sin of infirmity but a sin of malignity,
perverseness and contempt.

Who were such.
Such an Hypocrite as we do here especially intend in this work. For we shall
speak of him in the most comprehensive signification, was Ahab. 1 Kings 21. 27,
28. 29. Amaziah, 2 Chronicles. 25. 2. 2 Kings 14. 3. Ioash, 2 Chronicles, 24. 12. and 25.
14. Balaam, Numb. 22. 8. 18. 19. Iehu, 2 Kings 10. 31. compared with Hosea 1.
4. Saul, 1 Samuel 13. 9. 10. 1 Samuel 15. 22, 23. Judas, Mat. 27. 2, 3. Demas, Col.
4. 14. compared with 2 Timothy 4. 10. The Pharisee, Luke, 18. 10. Alexander, Acts
9. 33. compared with, 1 Timothy 1, 20. Cain, Gen: 4. 4. Heb: 11. 4. Ananias and
Saphira, Acts 5. 1, 2, etc. Herod. Mark 6. 20. Doeg. Psalm 52. 2, 3, 4. compared
with 1 Samuel 21. 7. and 22. 9, 18. Simon, Acts 8. 13, 20. The Harlot, Prove. 7.
14. Absalom, 2 Samuel 15. 3, 7, 8 etc. Antichrist, Rev. 9. 8. and 13. 1, 2. etc.
The Devil the greatest of all Hypocrites, 2 Cor. 11. 14. Mark. 1. 24. And (as
some say) Nicolas, Acts 6. 5. of whom it is supposed came the Sect of the
Nicolaitans. Rev. 2. 15. And such a^ one we take that young Ruler to be in Luke
18. 19. Mark 10. 17, 18. etc. that came to Christ to know what he must do to
be saved, who seems to be one of the strict Sect of the Pharisees, who boasts
more then the Pharisee in Luke 18. 11. and he pretends much respect to Christ,
and that he will be ruled by him, but it was not at all in his heart, for it
appears that he was as rich (in his own conceit) within of grace, and he was
without in wealth, so full therein that he saw no need of Christ, nor would he
leave all for him alone, but trusted to himself and his own righteousness,
Luke 1. 53. Rev. 3. 17. Luke 6. 25. Mat. 13. 46. Luke 10. 38. Phil. 3. 8. And
such Hypocrites we take them to be, who are spoken of in Ezech. 33. 31. With
their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their
Covetousness. Ier. 12. 2. Thou art near in their mouth, but far from their
reyns. Mat. 15. 8. out of Esaias 29. 13. This people draw nigh me with their
mouth, etc. but their heart is far from me. Psalm. 78, 35. 36. When he flew
them, then they sought him, and returned and enquired early after God. And
remembered that God was their Rock, and the most high God their Redeemer:
Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouths, and they lied to him with
their tongues, for their heart was not right with him, neither were they
steadfast in his Covenant, Psalm. 50. 16. But to the wicked God says, What have
thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou should take my Covenant in
thy mouth, seeing thou hate instruction? Esaias 1. 10, 11. etc. To what purpose
the multitude of your Sacrifices? etc. Hosea 7. 14, 15, 16. They have not cried
to me with their heart, when they howled on their beds, etc. they return but
not to the most high, they are like a deceitful bow, etc. Tit. 1. 16. They
profess that they know God, but in works they deny him, Esaias 41. 1, 2, 3.
etc. Hear ye, o house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, which
came forth of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the Lord, and
make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, they call themselves of
the holy City etc. thou art obstinate etc. 2 Timothy 1. 2. and 5. Having a form
of Godliness but denying the power thereof, 1 Timothy 4. 2. Speaking lies in
Hypocrisy. Tit. 1. 10. Deceivers etc. Teaching for lucres sake, Esaias 58. 1, 2,
3. They seek me daily etc. Esaias 65. 5, 8. Which say stand by thy self, come
not near to me, for I am holier then thou, Mich. 3. 11. They lean upon the
Lord and say etc. Psalm. 106. 12. Then believed they his words. They sang his
praise, they soon forgot his works, etc. Mat. 7. 22. Luke 13. 27. Not every
one that says Lord, Lord etc. In thy name have we prophesied, cast out
Devils, and done wonderful things. We have eaten and drank in thy presence,
and thou have taught in our streets etc. I know you not etc. Such were the
whole Nation of the Jews that professed themselves to be Gods people, and did
not live like his people; that gloryed in their having of the Law of God, and
kept it not; that they were the Children of Abraham, but did not walk in his
steps; that boasted of the Temple and worship, but were unholy in their lives;
that came of Israel, but were not the Israel of God, nor true Israelites
indeed, Esaias 10. 6. Rom: 9. 6, 7, 8. Gal: 6. 10. Io. 1. 46, 47. Rom: 2. 23, 29.
Esaias 41. 1. Io: 8. 33. Mat: 3. 9. Such were the Scribes and Pharisees, Mat. 23.
13. etc. and 15. 7, 8, 9. The five foolish Virgins, Mat. 25. 1, 2. etc. The
three sorts of bad Hearers, Luke 8. 12, 13, 14. And such are they that are
spoken of in Psalm. 69. called the enemies of David, and Christ, and his Church,
v. 4. under the name of his Brethren and Mothers Children, v. 8. and in Psalm.
139. throughout. So in Psalm. 58. throughout. 2 Pe. 2. 3. Col: 2. 22. Job 27. 8,
9, 10. Josh: 1. 16. Deuteronomy. 5. 20. And such are Intended by the Tares and bad
fish, in Mat: 13. 25, 38, 48. And the house built upon the sand, Mat: 7. 23,
24, 25. Of such is it spoken, Amos 5. 21. Micha. 6. 7. Hosea 9. 4. and 8. 13.
Ier: 5. 1, 2, 3. and 9. 10. and 7. 21. Phil: 1. 18. Psalm. 58. 1, 2. Ezekiel. 1. 2.

with, Psalm: 41. 6. And in diverse other places of Scripture. And all these in
Scripture sense, and in some degree are to be accounted Hypocrites. And these
Hypocrites in Scripture Language are How called.

Wicked and ungodly, Jude 4. Psalm: 50. 16. Prove: 15. 8. The children of the
Devil, Jo: 8. 44. 1 Jo: 3. 12. Devils Jo: 6. 70. A generation of vipers, Mat:
3. 7. and 12. 34. The perverse, Pro: 12. 8. Such as are without the Spirit of
Christ, Jude ver. 19. Such as forget God, Psalm: 50. 16, 22. Reprobates 2 Timothy:

1, 2. Deceitful, Psalm. 109. 2. Unbelievers, Jo: 6. 64. 70. Workers of
Iniquity, Matthew. 7. 23. And all this is true of them, and therefore hereby also
we may see who is not a child of God, or in Christ, but a Reprobate, a wicked
person, or a Child of the Devil. We will now pass to the sorts or kinds of
Hypocrisy, and Sincerity.

CHAP. II.
Of the several kinds of Hypocrisy and Sincerity. And of the Several sorts of
Hypocrites.

Hypocrisy, and so Sincerity also (as to the kinds thereof) are considerable
in men diverse ways. 1. In reference to the man in whom it is in general, as
it respects his heart in what he does, whether he be rotten or sound therein,
So Christ calls the Pharisees Hypocrites in Mat. 23. often. 2. With reference
to the matter wherein it is acted and shows it self. And so it is
considerable also, Either in relation to the inward affections and motions of
the heart; or the words of the mouth; or the works of the hands: It is
considerable, as to the affections and motions of the heart within, whether
they be indeed, as they seem to be in show, by the words and works without. For
a man may pretend to true Faith, Love, Repentance, and other Graces and works
of the Spirit, whereof there may be some appearance or likeness upon him, and
which he may think he has in truth within him, but has it not indeed, nor any
thing, but the picture and Image thereof only. For there are some things like
to that are not saving Graces: and there is no saving Grace in truth in a
Saint, but there may be and is, the likeness of it in an Hypocrite. There are
natural gifts and works arising from the natural constitution and temper of a
man. And so a man may be naturally meek, loving, kind, merciful, courteous and
peaceable. There may be, and are many very commendable qualities wrought in a
man by Education, reading, example and the like. And hereby some have attained
to virtues like to saving Graces. And there are Spiritual Gifts, or common
operations of the spirit of God, distinct from saving grace which is called
unfeighned grace, 1 Timothy 1. 5. Acts 8, 37. The grace of Gods Elect, and Grace
which does accompany Salvation, Tit. 1. 1. Heb. 6. 9. And so a man may have the
appearance of any saving Grace, and yet not have the Grace it self, Mat. 23.
27, 28. Jo. 2. 24. Psalm. 78. 36, 7. Acts 8. 21, 23. Psalm: 136. 11, 12, 13.
Exodus: 14. 31. Romans 12. 9. 2. Hypocrisy and Sincerity also, are considerable as
to the words whether they be so in the intention of the Speaker, in themselves,
and may produce the effect they do prima facie, seem to be and to produce. Or
they be not lies spoken in Hypocrisy, 1 Timothy 1. 2. and dangerous Errors under
glorious pretenses, Romans 16. 18. These things are considerable as to works.
And this not only whether it be a work really done from his heart that does it,
but that it be such a work as is good and ought to be done. And so Hypocrisy
and Sincerity are considerable in relation to all the actings of a man's whole
life, as that of Amaziah 2 Chronicles. 25, 2. Scribes and Pharisees, Mat. 23. and
others 1 Kings 8. 62. Or to some particular actings of a man's life; as that
Gal. 2. 10. 2 Chronicles. 29. 34. 1 Kings 8. 48. 1 Chronicles, 12. 38. 2 Chronicles: 19. 10.
Hypocrisy also (as to the work) may be said to be either express; which is
either where the thing done is, being a good thing and commanded by God, is
done, either against the heart, or not with the whole heart, or to a good, but
to a sinister end. So Jer. 3. 10. Phill. 6. 5, 6, 7. Coll. 3. 23, 22. Hosea 7.
16. Or it is Implicit and interpretative. And so are all the glorious works of
Piety, Mercy, Charity, and Justice done by the Professor of Religion, by men
out of Christ, and without Faith, though done with never so much seeming
integrity, seeing they are not of faith, without which it is impossible to
please God. For as the works are but Splendida peccata, glorious sins, so are
they in some degree more or less done in Hypocrisy, and they Hypocrites that
do them, 1 King 21. 27, 28, 29 Acts 26. 29. And all these things thus done in
Hypocrisy, as before in any sort, are opposed to the sincere obedience of the
Faithful, Deuteronomy. 30. 10. 2 Kings 23. 25. 2 Jo. 4. Jer 24. 7. Esaias 29. 13. Of
such Hypocrites as we have spoken of, that are rotten at heart, there are
diverse sorts. There are Hypocritical Nations (that is) such Nations as live
not up to their Profession. Such was the Jewish Nation, Isa. 10. 6. And such is
any Nation now professing the Christian Religion, that live not becoming
Christians. And there are Hypocritical persons. And amongst these
Hypocritical The Gross Hypocritie.
Persons. There are Gross Hypocrites and Refined Hypocrites. The Gross
Hypocrite is also either more Gross, or less Gross, yet both of them are
very gross. The more gross is one that either does notoriously dissemble
against his own light, in what he does of purpose to cheat and deceive others.
The less Gross is one who does maintain some gross Errors, or live in some
gross practice of Sin. There are Hypocrites in Opinion, The Nature of his
Hypocrisy.
and Hypocrites in Action. The Hypocrite in Opinion we call him that pretends
to Truth of opinion, to hold forth the very truths of God out of love unto
them, and yet maintains Error and Heresy. And the Hypocrite in Action we
call him that pretends to holiness of life, and real co^formity to Gods
will, without in his conversation, where he has no inward and hearty affection
thereunto. And both these are either more gross or more refined. The more
gross Hypocrite in Opinion, is one who makes a great show outwardly, of
holding forth Gods Truth, where he is inwardly in his heart, such an enemy to
it, that he spreads abroad his errors, and this he does knowingly, and of
purpose to deceive. So it is more then probable did the Pharisees in some of
their opinions, which they could not but know to be Erroneous. So some of the
Gnostics of old, taught a lawfulness in Christians, to commit Fornication by
a Gospel liberty, and to deny Christ in case of persecution, to save
themselves from death. So Papists and other Heretics now, who teach
unlawfulnes of marriages of meats, and other such like things, contrary to the
clear evidence of the word. These no doubt (many of them) did and do know that
they did and do maintain Errors and Heresies, and yet they did and do
continue to maintain them for some advantage to themselves, 1 Timothy 4. 2.
Speaking lies in Hypocrisy. The more Gross Hypocrite in Action or practice,
is he that assumeeth a form of Godliness, and pretends to a forsaking of
sin and infidelity, by Faith and Repentance within him, when he has only the
show, and appearance thereof. And he neither has nor intends, or desires to
have, or do any such thing, and knows he does dissemble, and does it of
purpose to deceive others thereby. This indeed is an Hypocrite in grain, or an
Hypocrite in the highest degree, when a man shall pretend to the Truth of
Religion, and does make it his whole design, trade, or work, therein to act
Hypocrisy only. Such a one is said to be a Cheator or Juglor, that shows
tricks, and makes appearances of things that really are not so as they
appear; the same word in the original, it is said, serves for both. And he
is compared to a person disguised, or a Stage Player, who in the sight of
others, may act the part of a King, or honest man, but when he is in his tyring
house, is but a base varlet, and he knows himself to be so. And such an
Hypocrite the Devil is, that sometimes appears like an Angel of light, that
he may do the more mischief; we call him so, that Saints may not be ignorant
of his wiles, and the Scripture warrants it, 2 Cor. 11. 14. Mark. 1. 24. And so
when he appears most innocently and piously, he acts most wickedly and
dangerously: so Joab covered his perfidiousnesse to Abner and Amasa with
friendly words, and Siren* like salutations when he murdered them, 2 Samuel 2.
27. and 20. 9. And Ismael, covered his bloody purpose to kill the eighty men,
Crocodile-like with Tears, Jer: 41. 6. Such were the Scribes and Pharisees,
who Viper-like covered their venomous teeth, under their gumms of glorious
shows and pretenses, Mat. 22. 15, 16 Jo. 8. 3, 6. Luke 10. 25, 26. Such were
Cain, Saul, and others mentioned in Scripture, who made their Religion and
profession, a cloak only for the wickedness. And such a one is Antichrist the
Arch-hypocrite of the World) who covers his Lions teeth, and Serpents tail,
with Woman's hair, a Man's face, and the horns of a Lamb, Rev. 9. 8. and 13. 1.
So false teachers do cover themselves and their Wolfish cruelty, with sheeps
clothing, Mat. 7. 15. and these Scribes and Pharisees made their Religion but a
color and cloak for their wickedness, Mat. 23. 14. Woe unto you Scribes
Pharisees Hypocrites, for you devour Widows Houses, and for a pretense make
long prayers, etc. So Absalom pretended the worship of God, Zeal to Justice,
and love to the people of God, when he intended nothing, but the advancement of
himself to the Crown, with the death of his Father, 2 Samuel 15. 2. to the 11.
so Iehu pretends to a zealous Reformation in Religion, and execution of Gods
command, when he intended nothing but his own advancement to the Throne, 2
King. 10. 15, 16, 17, 18, 30, 31. So those named in Rev. 2. 9. and 3. 9. Which
say they are Jews and are not, but the Synagogue of Satan, 2 Cor. 11. 13, 14.
False Apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the Apostles
of Christ, etc. Rom: 16. 18. By good words and fair speeches, deceive the
hearts of the simple to serve their bellies etc. So many Papists and others at
this day; keep their forms and ways of worship, and pretend they are in the
right way to salvation, when they themselves know the contrary. And that they
do so of purpose for some advantage to themselves. The less Gross Hypocrite,
we call him that is a gross Heretic or Idolater, as a Papist, Arrian, and the
like, or one that together with his profession, is very loose in his
conversation, as those Hypocrites, Isa. 1. 1, 2. etc. and 2 Timothy 2. 3, 4, 5.
The Refined Hypocrite is also more refined, or less refined. The Refined
Hypocrite.
The more Refined Hypocrite is he that pretends to any thing of Grace and true
Godliness without, the which is in part only, or he takes to be altogether
within The Nature of his Hypocrisy.
him. So many a man in the profession of the Gospel, and his carriage without
pretends to truth of Grace within, where there is something like it, and he
does judge it to be there in Truth, and that he is not an Hypocrite but
upright. And it is not to be doubted but that a man may be an Hypocrite, and
not know it. He may do all things according to the letter of the word right in
appearance, and as to the reality of what he does in Truth, and be hereupon
persuaded, that he has grace in his heart in uprightness, is in the favor of
God, and in a happy and safe estate, and so continue to his dying day, and yet
be damned at last, Prove. 14. 12. There is a way that seems right to a man,
but the end thereof are the ways of death, Prove. 30, 12. There is a generation
that are Pure in their own eyes, and yet not washed from their filthiness. So
Paul, 1 Timothy 1. 13. The foolish Virgins. Matt. 25 and the young Man Matt. 29.
Were all of them real in what they made show of, and pretended to. And yet
they were Hypocrites, and so are all such as shall do likewise, as many do at
this day, who pretend to be true Christians and Saints, etc. And do make a
profession of that, and do appear to others and themselves, to be such as
they are not, for they would be thought to be true Christians, and yet have not
the Soul of a true Christian within them, Romans 2. 28. For he is not a Jew that
is one outwardly, neither is that Circumcision, which is outward in the flesh.
But he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and Circumcision is that of the heart in
the spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men but of God, Rev.
2. 2. Thou have tried them that say they are Apostles and are not, and have
found them liars.

The less refined Hypocrite we call him that possibly may either hold some
more gross opinions, as some Superstitious. Persons that are only Popish in
some points, or some worse practices, or are not so exact in their lives as the
former sort. And yet perhaps may be secure, and judge themselves in an estate
good enough, Ia. 1. 25. 26 So that we call them more or less Gross, as there
is more of their wills and purposes, by design in their Profession, and
painted outside of good to device, Or as their evil opinions and practices
they hold or do, are more or less evil. And more or less Refined as they
are more or less privy to their own mistake and deceit; or as the opinions or
practices they hold or act, are more or less dangerous. This difference of
Hypocrites, the Apostle seems to hold forth, 1 Timothy 1. 13. Acts 3. 17. I did it
ignorantly. so that there is a simple ignorant, as well as a wilful knowing
Hypocrite. The first sort of these Hypocrites deceive others only. But the
latter sort, deceive themselves also, James 1. 21, 26. If any seem to be
Religious etc. that deceives his own heart, etc. So the foolish virgins that
were never disordered by the wise nor themselves till the gate of grace was
shut upon them. Some make a third sort of Hypocrite between the two forenamed
ones, and make him such a one that does somewhat suspect himself, and yet for
some self ends continues and bears up in his profession as long as he can.

And amongst these diverse sorts of Hypocrites, there are found these
differences. Or they may be distinguished thus. 1. There is a malicious or
spiteful Hypocrite, and he is such a one as does hate and malign the true
Christian, and will do to him all the mischief he can. And this is such a one
as for this, is compared to a Viper or Serpent, for his venom and mischief
against, and danger to the true Church. And such were the Scribes and Pharisees,
Matt. 12. 24. and 23. 33. Io. 6. 70. and 8. 44. called therefore Gods enemies,
Psalm. 109. 4, 29. and 79. 26. 14. Esaias 56. 6. your Brethren that hate you etc.
2. There is a loose or careless Hypocrite, one that together with his
profession of Religion, is very licentious and loose in his conversation. Such
were those in Esaias 1. 1, 10, 11, 12. etc. and those in 2 Timothy 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
3. There is a strict or an exact Hypocrite, one that for his outward
conversation is as fair, and looks as beautiful as the most Sincere
Christian, but is rotten within. Such were the Foolish Virgins, Mat. 25. 1, 2.
etc. Hosea 7. 11. Mat: 22. 17.

Ob: But it may be objected. That we call him an Hypocrite, that does what he
does really and from his heart, which is no Hypocrite?

Ans: 1. We grant that men may be and are in their hearts within, often times in
that which is evil in opinion and practice, the same as they are in their
profession and appearance without. So we find in Paul's case, Acts 28. 9. I
verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things against the name of
Jesus, etc and Christ tells his Disciples, Io. 16. 2. that the time was coming,
that whosoever should kill them, should think they did God service in it. And
we are persuaded that most of the Common people, under the various forms of
Religion in these times, as Papists, Quakers, and the like, are cordial, and
do take themselves to be in the right. But 2. If we say to this farther, that
a man may do many things well, and (in his own judgment and opinion)
according to the Law and Gospel of Jesus Christ, and yet the person so doing
be so far from being a Sincere good Christian, that he is (all the while) a
desperate sinner, and (in that sense we now speak of) an Hypocrite. So it was
with S. Paul Acts 23. 1. where he says, I have lived in all good Conscience
before God until this day. His meaning is, though he had fiercely persecuted
the Servants of Jesus Christ, yet he thought he did well, his conscience
(though erring) concurring with him, so that he sinned not against his
conscience, but acted according to that light which was in him, even then when
he sinned against the Law of God and the Gospel. 3. A thing may be done truly
as to the reallity of it, but not truly as to the formality of it, Hypocrisy
therefore is said to lie in two things, or to be considered two ways. 1. As it
stands in opposition to the truth and reality of a thing. 2. As it stands in
opposition to the Sincerity of a man's intention in the thing. A man out of
Christ is not a Christian indeed, no more then a dead corpse without a Soul is
a man. And that he does, let him do it never so really and cordially, cannot
be good, because he that dot it, is evil Gen: 4. 4. Mat: 12. 33. And if the
thing to be done be evil, let it be done never so cordially and really, it
cannot be good. And the thing done, albeit it be for the manner well done as to
the reality and intention, yet if the thing done be in the matter, and in its
own nature evil, it cannot be good, a thing also that in its own nature is
good, may yet for the manner and form of doing it, be evil. And to this
therefore we are to know, That the thing that the thing that is said of done,
is for the matter of it, good or evil; If good, yet it may be done amiss in
the manner. In 2 Chronicles: 25, 2. It is said of Amaziah, that he did that which
was right, (that is, that which was according to his will, and pleased him
well) but not with a perfect heart; though the thing he did, as also the
greatest part of that which Iehu did, was according to Gods command, and that
which (for the matter of it) God approved when done, yet they did it with an
eye to themselves only, out of self-love, and for their self interest and
advantage only, and not of any love to God, or care, or desire to please or
glorify him in it, Esaias 10. 6, 7. But if the thing (for the matter of it) (be
it opinion or practice) be evil, the doing or saying thereof from the heart,
will not make it good, or better then it is. For if by this, the opinion or
Action may be justified, or absolutely excused, then must the most horrid
opinions and practices that ever were held or done by this, be so far
countenanced, such as the opinions against Christ's Divinity, and that to eat
flesh is as bad as to eat Souls, and the practice of the killing of the
Saints of God, and the sacrificing of men's children to Idols, and the
worshipping of the Host of Heaven. For all this those that did maintain and
act them (at least some of them) were persuaded of the lawfulness of. And if
no men of any Judgment or persuasion amongst us, shall judge themselves only
to be the true Christians, and all others Antichristians, and shall take up
this persuasion, and perhaps from those Scriptures, Rev. 16. 6. Psalm: 137. 8,
9. That as they are able they may and must destroy all the rest. Or (being of a
levelling judgment) that they may take away as they are able from others that
have much to make an equality. May they therefore do it? or is the thing ever
the better because they are persuaded they may, nay (it may be) that they must
do it? and is not the thing being sinful and against Gods law, sinful still
notwithstanding their persuasion. This point and case of Conscience is cleared
and determined to our hands by the Apostle Paul himself in his own case, who
tells us in 1 Timothy 1. 13, 14. that he in what he did was a blaspheamer, a
persecutor, and injurious, but that he obtained mercy, And we do not find that
the opinions or practices of those Heretics in Jude, and 2 Pe. 2. and 2 Timothy:
3. are said to be ever the less sinful or dangerous to some, because they did
probably believe them to be Truth. We grant it to be true, that it does
somewhat lessen the offense, because it is of Ignorance in them that are
misled, and yet we affirm that it is so much the greater again, as there is
more of the will in it.

5. But there is much of Hypocrisy also in these persons in these cases. For
they pretend to be indeed the only enlightened men and Saints, to have the
spirit. That the truth is with them, and that their way is Gods way and the
true and the right way. Whereas they are in truth but Hypocrites, False
Teachers, Devils in the appearance of Angels of Light, understand not what
they say, not having the Spirit, and going themselves, and leading others with
them to destruction, Jude. 2 Pe. 2. Acts 20. 30. Prove: 2. 10, 11.

We shall in the next place lay down some particular instances of the
Hypocrisy and Sincerity we are treating of, and wherein they do each of them
consist.

CAP. III.
Wherein Sincerity does especially consist, And some particulars thereof. And
wherein Hypocrisy does especially consist. And some particulars thereof.

IT will much make toward the clearing of our matter in hand, that we lay
down some things more particularly wherein Sincerity and Hypocrisy, in men
professing Religion, or pretending to any way, or form of Godliness do
consist. And for the doing hereof, we shall offer these considerations
following, for the things in such Persons, wherein they do especially appear
and consist. That he that thus makes a profession of Religion, (that is) of the
Christian Religion, Faith in God by Jesus Christ. That cries Lord, Lord, Mat.
7. 21. that shall make an open confession of Christ, and his hope in him, That
names the name of Christ, 2 Timothy: 2. 19. Luke 9. 20. Psalm. 50. 1. that is a
hearer of his word; That has a form of Godliness, 2 Timothy 2. 1, 5. That
professes he knows God, Tit. 1. 16. That is a Christian in show or outwardly,
To. 2, 28, 29. Jo. 1, 47. Rev. 3. 1, 9. To. 9. 6. That calls himself or is
called, or reputed by others to be a Christian, Rev. 2. 9. Jer. 14, 9. A
Disciple of Christ, Luke 6. 40. Jos 8. 31. Of the holy Seed of Gods Children,
Esaias 7. 13. Of the holy City the Church of God, Esaias 48. 2. Acts 11. 26. That
lays claim to, and boasts of the Gospel, and the rest of the privileges
of the Church of Believers, Ma. 3. 8. Romans 2. 23. Io. 8. 37, 38, 39.

SECT. I.
As he is a Christian indeed.

The Sincerity or Hypocrisy of such a Professor, will appear and lie much in
this, as he has or has not within him a Principle and Foundation for what is
acted, and does appear without him. That he (pretending to be a Christian) be
so indeed, 1 Timothy 5. 3. Ioh. 1. 47. 8. 31. That he be by the immorrall seed of
the word of God, brought to be a believer in Christ, and so in Christ by his
Faith, and Christ by his spirit in him; For otherwise there is no being of a
Christian, no more then there is of a man that has a Body and no Soul, Gal:
2. 20. Coll. 3. 12. and 1. 27. And if so, then Christ is formed in him, and he
is thereby made at the same instant a new Creature like to Christ himself, 1
Pe. 1. 23. Io. 1. 12. 13. Io: 3. 4, 5. Gal. 4. 19. That there be within him the
foundation or root of Repentance from dead Works, and Faith in God, Heb. 4. 1.
And thereby that Jesus Christ be laid in the heart, for hereby only a man does
become a living and true Christian, 1 Cor. 3. 11. Mat. 13. 21. herein lies a
foundation for sincerity. And Hypocrisy lies in the contrary hereof, where a
man shall pretend to be a Believer in Christ, assume the body, name, and shape
of a Christian, and pretend to be a new Creature, and true Christian, and is
not so indeed. He is not as yet begotten again, 1 Pet: 1. 3. He never saw his
case by nature, his need of Christ, never was broken in heart; went to Christ
laden, and as a sick man to his Physician, he never sought by Faith, to have
him into his heart, but if he did look after Christ, it was perhaps for some
thing else, Io. 5. 40. Esaias 66 2. Mat 11. 28. Io. 3. 13, 14, 15. 16. Io. 6. 26,
27. This man seems to be a living Christian, but is dead, Rev. 2. 1. as a
building without any foundation, Mat. 7. 24, 25. etc. A tree without a root,
Mat. 13. 21. Rev. 3. 9. That say, they are Jews and are not. Romans 9. 6. They
are not all Israel, that are of Israel. etc. Nor are all they that appear to
be Christians, and are so called, Christians indeed, Io. 1. 47. Romans 2. 28, 29.
He is not a Jew that is one outwardly, etc. But he is a Jew, that is one
inwardly, etc. Esaias 48. 1, 2, 3, etc. and 41. 1. Romans 2. 17. and 9. 6. Io: 8.
33. Mat. 3. 9. And this may be the case of many professing Christians in the
World at this day, among Protestants of all sorts, Lutherans, Call. vinists,
Presby erians, Independents, new Baptized men, 5 Monarchy men, Arminians,
Quakers, and the rest, and also amongst Papists.

SECT. II.
As he is taught of Christ.

2. It lies much in this, as the Professor is taught of Christ. The true
Christian he does first of all come to Christ, and is taught of him by his
word, and knows the Truth of the Gospel, as it is in Jesus, and carries the
same with him to direct his way in his opinion and conversation. For the first
thing that the true convert does at his conversion, is to ask what he is to
do. As did Paul. Acts 9. 6. and the Gaylor, Acts 16. 30. And the Converts Act.
2. 37, 38. and to learn the knowledge of Gods ways, Esaias 22. Ephesians 1. 18, 19.
Mat. 11. 25. 1 Cor. 2. 14. 2 Ioh. 1. 2, 3. etc. By this knowledge of the truth
only are men regenerate, 1 Cor. 4. 15. 1 Pet. 1. 3. And by this knowledge are
men saved 1 Timothy 2. 4. Ephesians 1 13. And therefore all the saved are said to be
such as know the truth, 2 Io. 1. 1. On the other side Hypocrisy lies in this.
That a man pretending to be a true Christian is ignorant and has no ground or
warrant for what he holds or practices, but is led aside by his own or other
Fancies into error in opinion or practice, be he never so cordial in it, yet
it is a piece of Insincerity, 1 Timothy 4. 2. Speaking lies in Hypocrisy. Hence is
that exhortation Eccles. 5. 1. and 1 Chronicles. 28. 8. And so was Paul
Hypocritical in what he did before his conversion, 1 Timothy 1. 13. Hence is that
Phill. 1. 9. Io. 6. 45. Pro. 17. 2. Gal. 6. 16. 1 Cor: 2. 13, 14.

SECT. III.
As he is obedient to what he is taught.

3. It lies much in his Obedience to what he is taught. The sincere Christian
does give himself up wholly to the obedience and practice of the will of
Christ, so revealed to him by his word, that he is not only a hearer, but a
doer thereof, and is made conformable to it, and to bring forth the fruit of
it, his heart is so dissolved and melted by the work of the Spirit in it, that
it is become like wax made soft. As this will take any impression of the Seal,
so that any Impression of the Spirit; That he does believe any thing which God
does promise, and will do any thing which God does command, especially the
Gospel and doctrine of Salvation by Jesus Christ, which he receives in the
love thereof, and resignes up himself to his obedience: and is exact and
circumspect in a holy walking with God, according to the will of Christ, Psalm:
119, 1. 3. Phil: 3. 17. 3 Io 4. Psalm: 26. 1. 6. Tit: 2. 11, 12. Act. 9. 6, 7.
Io. 1. 45, 46, 47. 2 Cor. 3 18. Acts 2. 37. 38, 42. Acts 16. 31, 32. etc. Isa.
2 2. Let us learn the knowledge of his ways and we will walk therein, Rom: 2.
13. James 1. 22. Mat. 3. 8. 9. Mat. 13. 22, 23. the good hearer. But otherwise
for a man to hear Gods word never so much, and so carefully and constantly, to
have or seem to have some love to, and delight in it, and to profit never so
much in the knowledge of it, and not at least in his desire and endeavor, to
live up, and be made conformable ^o it; but to be loose and careless in his
conversation and life, is but a piece of Hypocrisy. And so are all that are
enemies to, or the false friends of Jesus Christ. Mat. 7. 22, 23. Many will say
we have prophesied in thy name etc. Luke 13. 26. We have eaten and drank in thy
presence, and thou have taught in our streets, but he shall say, I know ye not,
depart from me ye workers of Iniquity. Notwithstanding all their fair
pretenses (more then most have) they were workers of iniquity, even then when
they wrought miracles. For he says I never knew you, Mat: 7. 23. (that is,) I
never loved you nor approved of you, no not then when you eat in my presence,
preached in my name, and by a faith of Miracles (which Hypocrites may have)
cast out Devils. The three sorts of bad hearers, Herod, Luke 6. the Pharisees,
Luke 19. 14. Jo. 15. 18. 2 These. 2. 10. Hosea 7. 8, 14. Ezekiel. 33. 31. They
hear thy words, but do them not. Rom: 16. 17. Amos 5. 10. Esaias 1 13 2. etc
48. 1, 2. etc. Psalm. 50. 16, 17. thou hate to be reformed. etc. 1 Timothy: 1. 2.
etc. Psalm. 58. 2.

SECT. IV.
As he labors to cleanse his heart.

4. Sincerity and Hypocrisy lie much in a man's labor, or neglect to cleanse
his heart. The sincere Christian, he does desire and labor, not only the
cleansing of the outside, and to seem to be good, but also and especially the
cleansing of the inside, and rather to be then seem to be good, Psalm. 119. 80.
Let my heart be sound, 1 Pet. 3. 3, 4. whose adorning, let it not be the outward
adorning etc. but let it be the hidden man of the heart, etc. Mat. 23. 27. 1 Timothy: 1. 5. The end of the Commandment (that is, the scope or substance of it,)
is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, Psalm. 58. 2 and 52. 3.
Acts 20. 13, 20, 21. Jo. 13. 26, 27.

SECT. V.
As he is more or less universal, and complete in his obedience.

5. Sincerity and Hypocrisy lie also much in the universality and partiality
of a man's obedience. The true Christian his desire and labor is to be
universally holy, pure, obedient: and conformable to the whole will of God, in
opinion and practice, in heart and life, and to be complete and perfect, he
will do no more nor less then what God requires in reference to Religion,
and what is betwixt God and him: And in reference to his converse and commerce
with men. Either as to his office, or to his calling, or to his Trading, or to
his Family, or to the poor or to the Rich: Job: 31. 24, 25, 26, 27, 33. Psalm i
78 72. And in his external obedience to the word, to be the same in all
things. He does all that is commanded. He is for all kind of works; works of
Piety, Charity, Justice, and Righteousness. And for all sorts of Duties,
public and private, greater and lesser, those that are in, and those that are
out of request, he is for praise, as well as prayer. Luke 17. 13, 15. And
avoydeth all that God forbids as David Psalm. 119. 6. 128. Zacharias and
Elizabeth, Luke 1. 6. and the Apostles Acts 2. 42. Ephe. 5. 1. Mat: 16. 24.
Phil. 2. 12. and does so in all times, and always: In times of prosperity as
well as in times of adversity. In times of the flourishing, as well as in times
of the persecuted estate of the Gospel, as David Psalm. 119. 44. 112. and 34.
1. and Cornelius Acts 10. 2. Phil, 2. 12. In all places secretly and openly:
abroad and at home, Psalm: 101, 1, 2. Phil: 2. 12. Mat: 6. 5, 6. In all Cases,
in Health in Sickness, in peace in trouble, in plenty in want, Psalm: 119. 54.
81, 82, 83. In all Companies good or bad, Friends or Enemies, Psalm: 119. 46 and
18. 21, 23. 24. And it lies much in this, as he is in his acts of Truth,
Mercy, Justice, and Righteousness toward men, Mat. 23. 14, 23. Esaias 1. 11,
12, 17, Psalm: 119. 10^. I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I
may keep thy word. And on the other side, herein lies much of Hypocrisy, that
a man does not labor to be holy throughout, but in part perhaps, in his life
only, and does allow of some evil in his heart, against the will of God. And
for this that his external obedience is lame and defective in some things:
that either he does too much, he joyneth with Gods commands the commands of
men, with the Counsels of the word, humane Traditions and his own fancies. So
the Pharisees Mat: 15. 2, 3, etc. Luke 18. 10, 11, 12. and the Jews, Hosea 5
1, 2, etc. Zeph: 1. 2, 3, 5. Esaias 65. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7. Mat: 5. 19. or he does
too little and lacks something, as the young man, Luke 18. 22. Either he does
not all that is commanded, or he does not avoid all that is forbidden, or he
does by halves that he does, as the Pharisees, Mat. 15. 3, 6. as Herod, Mark
6. 20, 21, 27. and Jehu, 2 Kings 10. 1, 2, 31. etc. and the Jews Exodus: 16, 28,
29. and as some think Naaman, 2 Kings 5. 18. and Saul, 1 Samuel: 10. 10. compared
with 14. 33, 34. Hosea 7. 8, 13, 16. and Balaam, Number. 31. 11. the Jews Isa. 1.
12, 13. etc. the Pharisees, Mat. 23. 23. or that a man does all that is
required, but not at all times, not in time of adversity, as in time of
Prosperity: so Jobs Hypocrite, Joh. 27. 10. So Saul, 1 Samuel: 13. 8, 9, 10. and
28. 7. and 15. 22, 23. Psalm: 78. 33, 34, 35, 36. Nor always but does start
aside, or fall quite away, 2 Timothy 4. 10. 1 Jo: 2. 19. Mat. 13. 20, 22, 23. Or
not in all places, he is better abroad then at home; in public then in
private, Psalm: 101, 1, 2 Mat. 6. 2, 5. Or not in all cases, in Religion
Flourishing Cases, but not in Religion, Suffering Cases, as Jobs Hypocrite,
Job. 27. 10. the stony ground, Mat: 13. 20, 22, 23. 2 Timothy: 3. 10, 16. or that a
man is not the same in all company, 2 Chronicles. 24. 2. Gal. 2. 13.

SECT. VI.
As he is more or less Cordial in what he does.

6. Sincerity and Hypocrisy lie much in these things, as a man is more or
less Real and cordial in what he appears to be, and that he does more or
less, really and cordially, what he does, Eccles. 9. 10. And for this, 1. As
he does more or less appear the same, or otherwise then he is. Or is indeed
and Truth as he is in word or show: or as he is more or less in show, and not
in Truth and Substance: or as he is, all leaves and no fruit. Or 2. As he is
more or less one and the same in his sayings and doings, or is all for saying,
and nothing for doing, or as his Saying and doings be not alike. 3. As he does
more or less pretend to what he does not intend: Or that what he pretends be
not intended, either for the matter, or end thereof. 4. As he does more or
less in what he does feignedly, or against the heart in all or part, And as he
doth' more or less entirely or partially, thoroughly or by halves, effectually
or ineffectually act what he did intend to do, Ier. 12. 2 Mark. 7. 6. Esaias 29.
13. Psalm. 119. 10. 1 Timothy: 1. 5. Rom: 6. 17. Psalm: 78. 34. 35. Mat: 23. 13. Rev:
3. 9. Rom: 2. 28 29. And therefore where a man does pretend to be Religious,
his Sincerity will lie in this, that he be so indeed, where a man does pretend
to Repentance, Faith, Reformation of life, Fasting, Prayer etc. that he do it
truly and not in a flattering or feyned way, or by halves, much less to cover
over any horrible wickedness, or to a wicked end, as those in Hosea 7. 7, 8.
and Zeph: 1. 5. 2 Kings 17. 32, 33. and Psalm: 78. 32, 33, James 4. 3. 1 Kings
21. 8, 9, etc. Mat: 5. 1, 2, 3, etc. Esaias 29. 13. Psalm: 119. 10. Ier: 3, 10. 1 Timothy: 1: 5, 2 Timothy: 1: 5. And where a man does pretend to a public Reformation
as a Magistrate, his Sincerity or Hypocrisy therein, will lie in this, as he
does it not in part only, as Jehu and others 1 King. 10 28, 29. but thoroughly
to set up all that is good, and take away all that is evil, as did Josias,
Jehosaphat, Nehemiah and others, 2 Chronicles: 34. 33. 2 Kings 23. 1, 2. etc. and
18. 5. 7. 1 Kings 10. 28, 29. And where a man does come pretending respect to
God his word and Servants, to hear, etc. It will lie in this, as he does or
does not intend any such thing, or have the contrary in his heart, as those
Luke 10. 28 and 18. 18. Mat: 22. 15 etc. Io: 8. 4. Prove: 29. 5. Mark: 1. 24.
And where a man does vow or promise to God, his Sincerity or Hypocrisy therein
will lie in this, As he does more or less, mind and intend what he promises,
and take care to perform it, Josh: 1. 16. Mat: 8. 19. Psalm: 22 25. and 60. 13.
Eccles. 5. 4, 5. And where a man pretends acts of kindness and friendship
without to men. His Sincerity or Hypocrisy therein will lie in this, as he does
more or less intend it accordingly, or intend the contrary to do mischief,
Psalm. 35 16. compared with Psalm: 41. 6. 1 Samuel: 18. 21. Ier. 41 6 Psalm. 69 10.
And where a man in his trouble shall repair to Gods people, and pretend a
desire to have their prayers and advice, his Sincerity or Hypocrisy herein,
will lie in this, as he does more or less really and indeed, desire and
esteem, and intend to make use of it, Ezekiel. 14. 1, 2. James 5. 13, 14, 16.
Ier. 42. 1, 2, 3, 19, 20, 21. and 43. 2, 4. And where a man pretends to draw
nigh to God in his service, his Sincerity or Hypocrisy therein will lie in
this, As his heart is more or less present in, and with, or far away, and
absent from the work, Ezech. 33. 31, 32. Esaias 29. 13. and 58. 1, 2, 3. Mark.
7. 6. Mark. 5. 1, 2, 3. Prove. 23. 26. Psalm. 9. 1. and 119. 10. And where a man
pretends to be a Teacher, and to go himself, and lead others to Salvation by
the Truths of God. His Sincerity or Hypocrisy will lie in this, as he is more
or less therein a true Teacher, and goes himself, and leads others in the
Truth toward Salvation, or by Error to destruction, Esaias 42. 18, 19. Mat. 23.
13, 15, 24.

SECT. VII.
As his Intentions are more or less pure in his Actings.

Sincerity and Hypocrisy also does lie much in the Purity or impurity of a man's
Actings, and his mind therein, 2 Chronicles. 25. 2. 1 Cor. 5. 8. 1 Timothy 1. 5. The
end of the Commandment is Love out of a pure heart, etc. 1. In his design and
aim in his first undertaking. As the same is more or less at, or for God and
his Glory, and the good of other men, or at or for himself, and his own ends,
Psalm. 101. 2. Io. 21. 15. Pro. 7. 14. Mat. 23. 6, 7, 13. Rom: 15. 17, 18. Mat:
6. 6. Hosea 7. 7, 8, 9. Micha 3. 11, 2. In his Principle and motive. As he does
therein more or less look upon himself, his selfe-Credit, Selfeease,
Selfe-content, Selfe-profit, Selfe-praise, or Selfe-safety, and is carried
forth therein, out of love to himself. Or looks upon God, and is carried forth
from the love of God, the fear of God, and his displeasure, a desire to please
him, Love to the thing to be done, and love of men, and Conscience of his
obedience to the command of God therein. Or as he is carried forth with a love
of, and a desire after the praise of men. Or is carried forth from the fear to
displease, or care to please men, 1 Cor: 13. 1. 1 Samuel: 15. 22, 23, 24, 30. Mat.
14. 5. and 21. 46. Heb. 6. 10. 2 Cor. 11. 11. and 5. 14. 1 Pe. 1. 8. and 3. 14.
Ephesians. 4 15. Psalm: 116. 1. Job 31. 4, 14, 23. Io. 5. 41, 42, etc. 1 Kings 18.
3. Exodus 1. 16, 17. Mat. 6. 6. Hosea 7. 7, 8. Tit. 1. 10. Mark. 11. 18. Acts
20. 30. Psalm: 78, 33, 34, 36: Io. 9. 22. and 12. 43. 3. In his way in the
general; As the Religion he falls into, be more or less pure and undefiled,
and according to the word of God, or corrupt and false, and as the thing he
does is more or less good or evil, forbidden or not commanded. James 1. 17.
Hosea 7. 8. 2 Kings 17. 33. Zeph. 1. 5. Rev. 3. 15. 16. Mat. 23. 4, 16. 4. As
he that does act is, or is not a man of a pure heart, as his heart is, or is
not cleansed by the blood of Christ, applied by Faith in his justification, and
by the Spirit and word of Christ in his Sanctification, 1 Timothy 1. 5. Mat. 23.
27, 28. and 12. 34. Io. 15. 3, 4. 5. In the manner of doing thereof. 1. As it
is done more or less after the pure Rule of Gods word, or after his own or
other men's fancies and inventions, Gal. 6. 16. Acts 13. 36. Mat. 15. 1, 2, 3.
etc. 2. As it is done more or less with the whole heart, and cheerfully and
willingly, or faintly and coldly, unwillingly or grudgingly, Psalm: 119. 10, 24.
Heb: 10. 12. Goll: 3. 22. Acts 17. 11. Psalm. 110. 3. 1 Pe. 5. 1, 2. etc. 3. As
it is done with a mind and heart more or less prepared, or unprepared to the
work, 2 Chronicles. 12. 14. and 20. 33. and 19. 3. and 29. 36. Psalm. 108. 1. 4. As
it is done more or less in and with the fear of God, as well as in the Fear
of men, Coll. 3. 22. Ephesians. 6. 6. 2 Samuel 23. 3. 5, As it is done more or less
in the love of God, arising from his love to him in Christ, and from his love
to other men, or from his love to himself alone, 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2: Gal. 5. 13.
1 Timothy 1. 10. Phil. 1. 15. 6. As it is done more or less with Faith unfeyned,
or ignorantly and doubtingly in unbelief, 1 Timothy 1. 10. Romans 14. 1, 2, 3. etc.
Heb. 11. 46. 7. And as it is done more or less to Right and pure ends, either
to God, or to a man's self, as to his ultimate, highest, and chief end, Hosea
7. 7, 8. Esaias 58. 1, 2, etc. Ephesians. 6. 6. 1 Cor. 6. 20. and 10. 31. That is
with these considerations. 1 That in the work (how mean soever it be) he has
to do not only with men, but with God also, Ephesians 6. 6. 2. That the eye of God
as well as of man is upon him in it, Psalm: 16. 8. Ephesians. 6. 6. 3. That he shall
be rewarded by God, for what he does according to his doing thereof, Ephesians. 6.
8. 2 Timothy, 4. 8. Coll, 3. 24. Mat. 6. 2. 4. And with an aim and desire most of
all to please God in it, Ephesians: 6. 8. Gal: 1. 10. 2 Cor. 5. 9. Coll: 3. 17, 22,
23. 1 These. 2. 4. 2. And as his ends in the thing to be done, are more or less
upon himself. Either to remove or prevent some evil felt or feared only,
Hosea 7. 14. Psalm 78. 33, 34. Or to gain some good, as the praise, applause
and favor of men, Riches, pleasure, ease, or content, Mat: 6. 6. and 23. 4.
13. 1 Samuel: 15. 25, 30. Acts 8. 13, 19. 1 Pe. 5. 2. Rom: 16. 17, 18. Micha. 3.
11. Or to cover over some wickedness in doing or to be done, Prove. 7. 14, 21,
22. Mat: 23. 14. and 6. 5, 6. Or as his ends are more or less upon, and for
the glory and praise of God. Coll. 3. 22. Gal: 2. 10. Io. 17. 4. Phill: 1. 21.
1 Cor. 10. 31. 2 Cor. 5. 14. And to please men, Acts 12. 3. Ier: 3. 10. Ephesians.
6. 6. or as his ends are more or less for the good and profit of men,
especially good men, and especially the good of their souls, 2 Cor. 5. 9, 10.
Gal. 1. 10. and 6. 10. Acts 13. 36. 1 Cor. 10. 31, 33. Io. 21. 15. And this is
discovered or may appear more or less, as the glory of God, or our own
advantage, is more or less upon our hearts, or we make it our design or work,
and as we can more or less do or not do it, or be contented or not contented
with, or displeased at it, when it is to our own loss and disadvantage, 2 Cor.
13. 7, 8, 9. etc. As for examples in the work, of Rule of Churches,
Commonwealths and Families, the Sincerity or Hypocrisy lies, and is much
showed by the putting forth of their power to the uttermost, or by halves, in
the work of Reformation, by their care and industry, or negligence, by their
faithfulness or treachery, but especially by the tenderness of the good of the
Ruled, that the Rulers do prefer the good of those, over whom they have
Rule, before their own good, Psalm. 78. 72. 1 Timothy 2. 2, 3. Romans 12. 8. 1 Pet.
5. 2, 3. 2 Kings 15. Nehem. 5. 14. Rom: 10. 1, 2, etc. Ezra, Nenemiah,
Jehosaphat, Josias, and others. And on the other side, Jehu, Saul, and others.
And in the work of Preaching, much is to be seen thereof in the man, as he
Preaches more or less the Truth of the Gospel, without any mixture of Error,
or of men's inventions, as he does more or less, advance the grace and glory of
God, and not his own glory, as he does more or less labor to please God, more
then men, as he does more or less, seek the good of the souls of the people,
more then his own good. And as his Preaching is with more or less
faithfulness and ingenuity, without subtilty and deceit; playnes without craft
or obscurity; boldness without fear; wisdom, watchfulness, care and
industry, without improvidence and neglect; Freedom without flattery;
Cheerfullnesse without weariness; humility without Lording; tenderness and
meekness without harshnesse; peaceablenesse without contention, and Love
without envy, and the like. And by these things also, the Hypocrisy of men
herein may be much seen, as they are more or less imperious, contentious,
seditious, crafty, menpleasing, self seeking, and the like, 2 Cor: 4. 2. 5, 1 Thessalonians: 2. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 2 Timothy: 1. 7, 14. and 2. 15. 1 Pet. 4. 11. 1 Timothy, 1. 3.
and 4. 2, 16. 2 Cor: 3. 12, 13. 1 Cor: 2. 4. and 4. 5. Luke 12. 42. Mat: 13.
52. 1 Pet: 5. 2, 3. Phil: 1. 16. 1 Cor: 9. 22. Rom, 10. 1, 2, etc. So in
Masters to their Servants, and Servants to their Masters in the service they
do. The Servants in their services, as they do it more or less In all things
with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart as unto Christ, not with eye
service, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart fearing God, and as the
Servants of Christ, that in whatsoever they do of the will of God, they do it
heartily with good will, doing service as to the Lord and not to men; knowing
that whatsoever good thing any man does, the same he shall receive of the Lord.
And as Masters do the same things, and not oppress their Servants, Coll: 3.
22, 23, 24, 25. Ephesians. 6. 6, 7, 8, 9.

SECT. VIII.
As a man does persevere.

8. Sincerity and Hypocrisy do lie and are much seen in this, in men's
constancy, perseverance, and holding out in their Appearances of good, or in
their starting aside, Apostasy and backsliding from it, Mat: 13. 22, 23. 1 Jo.
2. 19. Jo. 10, 28. 1 Io. 3. 9. Phil. 4. 12. Io: 8. 68. Rev. 2. 10. 2 Timothy 2.
17, 18. 1 Samuel 13. 8. and 28. 7. 2 Kings 1. 2. Psalm: 27. 4. 2 Timothy 4. 10, 14. 1 Timothy 1. 20. Acts 20. 30. Io 19. 38. and 9. 22. and 7. 13. and 6, 66.

SECT. IX.
As a man's opinion is of himself.

9. It lies also much in this, as a man with all his parts, gifts, and works,
is more or less lifted up within himself, with selfe-conceitednesse of his
own excellency to despise others; and does trust in himself and his own
righteousness; or has low or mean thoughts of himself, esteeming others
better then himself, and accounts of all that he has done, when he has done
all he can, but as less then his duty, and himself but an unprofitable
servant therein, and being poor in spirit, as he does more or less trust to
the Mercy of God in Jesus Christ, and take up his eternal rest, and lodging in
Jesus Christ alone for salvation, Heb. 4. 4. Luke 18. 11, 15. Psalm: 130. 3. 1 Timothy 1. 15. Luke 17. 10. Isa 65. 5. Ezekiel: 20. 43. Gal. 6. 14. Esaias. 66. 2.

SECT. X.
As a man does take the reproof of Sin.

10. And lastly. Sincerity and Hypocrisy in a man lies much in this, that
being fallen into sin, as he does more or less deny, defend, hide, shift or
mince it, or quarrel with them that reprove him, and hold it fast. Or as a man
is more or less willing to see his sin, to be reproved, and loves the
reprover, and as a man does more or less readily, and ingeniously confess it,
and labor to leave it, 2 Samuel: 12. 7, 8, etc. 13. Psalm. 141. 5. Pro. 28. 13. 1
Io. 1. 9. Genesis 3. 10. and 4. 9. 1 Samuel: 15. 14, 15. Job. 31. 33.

We shall now in the next place, endeavor to clear a doubt that lies in the
way, in reference to our Subject matter in hand, and to answer some objections
touching the same.

CHAP. IV.
Whether the Truth of Grace do lie in the degree or Quantity, or in the
Quality and Nature of it?

THere are some that make a new, and another kind of Hypocrisy, and say it is,
where there is truth of Grace within, but yet, not saving grace; Or would have
the truth of Grace to consist only in the degree, or measure thereof; and so
admit Hypocrites to have the truth of grace in them. But this we take to be a
mistake. And that there is no true grace (we mean) none of the grace that
accompanies Salvation, or is the grace of Gods elect only (for this only, and
not common grace, we call True grace) in any measure or degree in the heart of
any Hypocrite, nor is any thing so to be accounted, as it comes from him.
Somewhat that is like unto it, we admit to be in an Hypocrite. As painted fire
is like to true fire, and Artificial Pictures are like to the things they set
forth, and an Artificial Flower, is like to the true natural Flower, but it
is not the thing it self. So that which is in the heart of the Hypocrite is
not true Grace, 2 Timothy 3. 5. the which we affirm for these following reasons.
1. The Hypocrite in his heart, is as a corrupt tree twice dead and plucked up by
the Roots, Jude 12. Luke 6. 43. and therefore cannot but bring forth corrupt
fruit, he cannot bring forth living fruit; he brings forth Fruit, but it is
not good fruit. For until the tree be made good, the fruit cannot be good,
Mat. 7. 16, 17, 18. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes
of Thorns, or figgs of Thistles? Even so every good tree brings forth good
fruit: But a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit. He is also a corrupt
Fountain, James 3. 11, 12. Does a Fountain send forth at the same place sweet
water and bitter? Can the Figtree bear Olives? etc. Mat. 12 34, 35. O
generation of vipers, how can ye being evil speak good things? For out of the
abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. A good man out of the good treasure
of his heart, etc. Luke 6. 42. 2. If there be an unfeyned and Sincere grace, an
unfeyned repentance, Faith and Love; then there must be something like to it,
that may be called a feyned and counterfeit Repentance, Faith and love. But
there is the one, and therefore the other, 2 Cor. 6. 6. 2 Timothy 1. 5. 2 Jo. 1.
Acts 8. 37. Ephesians. 6. 24. 1 Pe. 3 4. 1 Jo. 3. 9. 10. If there be an
incorruptible and immortal grace, then there is a corruptible and mortal
grace. But there is the one and the other, 1 Pe. 1. 22. 23. 1 Cor. 15. 19. Mat.
13. 22, 23. Mat: 16. 16, 17. If there be a living Faith and hope, then there is
a dead Faith and hope: But there is the one and the other, 1 Pe. 1. 3. James 2
26. And if there be a special grace, proper and peculiar to the elect, then
there is another kind of general grace, which is common, and is the seeming
grace of Hypocrites: But there is the one, and therefore there is the other,
Tit. 1. 1. And if there be a grace that accompanies Salvation, then is there
somewhat else like to it, which does not carry to Salvation: But there is the
one; and therefore there is the other, Heb. 6. 9. And that this is a good kind
of Argument, we have Calvin in his Institutes lib. 3 cap. 2. Sect. 12. page 188.
in these words, Nec Paulus requireres a filiis Dei fidem non fictam, 1 Timothy 1.
5. nisi quia multi sibi audacter arrogant quod non habent; and inani fuco vel
alios, and interdum seipsos fallunt. 3. If saving grace lie only in the degree
and measure, then how shall a man know the Truth of his grace, or ever get
assurance of his own good estate thereby. For who can discern the parting
point? who can say just such a degree of Love, Faith, Repentance is sincere and
saving, and the next degree is short of it, and not saving? 4. By the Scripture
it self, and by the experience of Ancient and Modern times, we find it thus.
That the grace of most Christians is at the first, as the strength of Children,
very small and weak, and does commonly grow strong by degrees and in time,
Mat: 6. 30. and 8. 10. Luke 7. 9. And that some when they are perfectly grown
up, are not so able and shining as others. And that it is in this, as it is in
the natural body, 1 Cor: 15. 41. Dan. 12. 3. 1 Jo. 2. 13. We find also that
some true Christians, who for measure and quantity of saving grace have had as
much thereof as most men, yet some times by occasion of some temptation
without, the working of their own corruption within, and by Gods leaving of
them to their own strength, have fallen fowly and deeply in appearance, almost
(at least in their own sense) to the loss of all saving grace within them. So
David, Psalm. 51. 11. prays that God would restore his holy spirit again to
him, which argues, That in his present apprehension, he had utterly lost it, 2
Cor. 12. 1, 8, 9. And it is in this in Christ Mystical, as it is in the
Natural body of man, which may fall into a swoune or disease by which it may
be as dead for the present, no symptoms of life appearing, and yet life in the
body still. Also we find some of Gods people, under sad desertions all the
days of their life, and even as dead men, and nothing but a little Faith
appearing in them. It has been all darkness, and no light with them, the
Clouds have been between the light of Gods countenance and them always; And yet
the Sun has shined, The light of Gods countenance has been upon them, though
they have not seen it. Who shall doubt of these men's Sincerity, and that they
are precious Saints notwithstanding? Esaias 50. 10. Who is among you that fears
the Lord, that obeys the voice of his servant, that walks in darkness and
has no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God,
Ps. 88. 1. O Lord God of my salvation etc. ver. 4. I am accounted with them
that go down into the pit, I am as a man that has no strength, free amongst
the dead etc. ver. 14. Why hidest thou thy face from me, etc. Also we find
sometimes such as have little Grace in appearance, yet by an additionall
strength given in on a sudden from God, made able to do very great things,
Heb. 11. 34, 35, 36. Of Weakness were made strong etc. Women received their
dead etc. 1 Cor. 1. 27, 28. But God has chosen the foolish things of the
world, to confound the wise; And God has chosen the weak things of the world
to confound the things that are mighty; And Base things of the World, and
things which are despised has God chosen, yea and things which are not, to
bring to naught things that are, 2 Cor. 12. 9, 10. My strength is made perfect
in weakness, etc. Esaias 40. 28, 29. The everlasting God fainted not etc. He
gives power to the faint, and to him that has no might he increases
strength, That is, he makes his might to appear in man's weakness, enabling
him to do and suffer any thing, who of himself is able to do and suffer
nothing, Phil. 4. 13. Coll. 1. 11. Ioh. 15. 5. Also we find such as have had
and showed much Grace, and had in them much strength at some time, at other
times very weak as Jonas, Peter and others. And thus God would have it for the
making of way to the exaltation of his own glory and humiliation of his own
servants, 1 Cor. 1. 30, 31. That no flesh should glory in his presence, and
that he that glories might glory in the Lord. Also we find it sometimes, that
some of his own people, of whose Sincerity no man doubts, that they may be
under much means of grace, and yet have but little grace, and thrive but
little by those means; And in this case it is in the members of Christ's
spiritual body, as in the members of the natural body; that sometimes the
lower part, or one member of the body, by some distemper thereof, does not
increase but wast, and yet this though it be a sick, yet it is a true member of
the body, Heb 5. 12. For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have
need that one teach you again, which be the first Principles of the Oracles of
God, and are become such as have need of Milk, and not of strong mea^, Luke 24.
25. O fools and slow of heart to believe etc. Jo. 14. 9. Have I been so long
with you and yet have thou not known me? Besides all this does not the Apostle
Paul tell us (in the person of a Regenerate man) that in that very state, and
in the combat between the flesh and the Spirit, that Sin was many times too
hard for him, and he at the present (in a manner) overcome, and brought into
Captivity by it? and yet not so as to yield himself willingly to serve it, but
longing and desirous, and using all means to deliver himself, which upon the
first opportunity he will, and at length he shall do, howbeit for the present,
he may be kept under by it, Rom: 7. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. 2 Cor. 12. 7, 8.
And yet if any of these Christians happen to dye in any of these cases, shall
we doubt of their Salvation? Let Us see therefore what is said of our Savior
himself to this purpose, Mat. 12. 30. out of Esaias 42. 3. A bruisedreed will he
not break, and smoking flax, (that is) as it is interpreted, that which
burns dimly, and has more smoke then light, and like to such men as are
dimme-sighted, and have almost lost their sight, [He will not quench] that is,
he will not blow out, but raise, trim, supply, snuff, and make to burn
brighter. He shall not deal roughly, and rigorously with weak and tender
Souler, but shall have a special care of them, to support and strengthen them,
deal mildly and gently with them, and be tender hearted, as the Mother to her
child, toward them. And if there be any light of true grace, though but little
as the light of a candle going out, though with some corruptions therewith
stinking like to the snuff of a candle, he will cherish and perfect it. And
that such as have only desires of Grace, and some slender beginnings thereof,
shall be tenderly dealt with by Christ till they come to more maturity and
perfection, Esaias 40. 11. He shall gather the Lambs with his arms, and carry
them in his bosom, and gently lead those that are with young, etc. verse 28,
29, 30. He gives power to the faint, etc. they shall renew their strength,
etc. Mat. 11. 28. 5. If it be so that the thing that is wrought in the heart of
the Hypocrite be true grace, then it must follow, that true grace is mortal,
and corruptible, and may be lost. But true grace (in what degree soever it be)
is immortal and incorruptible, for it has its rooting in Christ, and is a
part of the new creature, 1 Pe. 3. 4. 1 Io. 3. 9. 1 Cor: 13. 8. But painted or
counterfeit grace, as it is without Root, Luke 8. 13. so is it but corruptible
and temporal, and will wither away and dye, 1 Pet. 1. 22. Nor can he that has
true grace perish, 1 Jo. 3. 9. Ephesians. 6. 24. 6. If common grace be of the same
nature and kind with special saving Grace, and differ only in the degree, then
must it be made up of the same causes as saving grace is, and have, and produce
the same effects (though not in the same strength and degree) as saving grace
has and does. But this is not so. It is not made up of the same causes,
neither does it produce the same effects. But there is in saving grace some
singular thing which is not in common grace, 1 Io. 2. 27. (i.) For all true and
saving grace (whether little or great, weak or strong) flows from the Covenant
of grace, made with the Elect only in Christ Jesus, wherewith the Hypocrite
has nothing to do, Ezekiel. 11. 19. Ier. 31. 31. Rom: 11. 5, 7. Psalm. 50, 16. ^.
True and saving grace, or sanctification, (which we take to be all one) is a
piece of the golden chain, by which Gods purpose, and the execution thereof in
the Salvation of his Elect, are knit together, and these cannot be sundred, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13. Romans 8. 30. 3. True grace does flow from, and is knit to the
Election of God out of which the Hypocrite is excluded, 1 Pe. 1, 2. 2 Thessalonians. 2.
13. 4. It comes from, or is part of our effectual calling, wherein the
Hypocrite has no share, 1 Cor: 1. 2. 1 Pe: 2. 21. 5. It is the fruit of
Christ's Purchase, wherein the Hypocrite has no share, Tit: 2. 14. Ephesians. 5.
25, 26, 27. Coll: 1. 21, 22. 1 Pe. 1. 2, 3. * 6. It flows from our union with
Christ, in which union the Hypocrite has no share, Io 15. 4, 6. 1 Cor. 1. 2.
Rom: 8. 10, 11. 1 Pe. 1. 2, 3. Coll. 2. 10, 11, 12. 7. It flows from the
Spirit of God in the new Creature, as from a new principle and spring of life,
which is not in the Hypocrite, Gal. 5. 22. Romans 8. 10, 11. 1 Pe. 1. 2, 3. Jude
19. 8. It carries or leads him in whom it is to glory, to which the Hypocrite
will never come, Romans 8. 26, 27. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13. If then there be Truth of
grace in the heart of the Hypocrite, then it will follow: That a man not within
the Covenant of grace, not predestined, not justified, not in Christ, not
having the spirit of God, not Elected; may yet be sanctified, which cannot be,
Romans 8. 30. 9. He that has Truth of Grace in him (be it never so small) is
Regenerate and shall overcome the world, 1 Io. 15. 7. But not this, and the
contrary hereof is true of the Hypocrite, 1 Io: 3. 9. 1 Io: 5. 4, 18. 10. He
that truly (though weakly) loves God, God loves him, 1 Io. 4. 12. Luke 7. 47.
But God does not love, but hate the Hypocrite, Psalm: 5. 5. 11. He that truly
(though weakly) loves the Children of God, as Gods Children, is in God, and God
dwells in him, 1 Io. 3. 14. and 4. 7. 16. 12. But this is not true of the
Hypocrite, Io. 15. 4, 5, 6. 12. He that has a true (though but a weak) hope of
Heaven in him, is begotten of God, 1 Pe: 1. 3. and does purify his heart from
sin, 1 Io: 3. 3. But not this, and the contrary of this is true of the
Hypocrite. It is well said therefore by Mr Sheapheard in his Sincere Convert,
page 107. in these words. True grace I tell you is a rare pearl, a glorious
Sun, clowded from the eyes of all but them that have it, Rev. 2. 17. a strange
admirable allmighty work of God upon the soul, which no created power can
produce, as far different in the least measure of it, from the highest degree
of, common grace, as a Devil is from an Angel. For it is Christ living,
breathing, reigning, fighting, conquering in the Soul. 13. There are amongst
the Elect of Christ, not only such as have a great deal of grace, but also
some that have but a little grace. There is a great Faith, and a little Faith;
and more love and less love, Mat. 6. 30. and 8. 10. Luke 7. 9, 47. They that
have much grace are called, or compared to strong and healthy men, young men,
or youths, that can away with strong meat: Men of full age, Fathers, Sheep, and
the like. And they that have little grace, in comparison of the others, are
called, or compared to lambs, fainty and feeble ones, Babes that need milk,
little children, Ewes great with young, to such as have no strength, and to
tender branches, which are applicable not only to young converts, but to riper
and more aged Christians fallen into some distemper of Sin. And yet are not
these as dear to God, and is not he as tender of them as of any of the rest?
Rom: 15. 1. Heb: 5. 14. Esaias 40. 11, 31, 32. 1 Cor: 14. 20. Ephesians. 4. 14. Cant
2. 5. Io: 21. 15, 16. Mat. 8. 26. and 14. 31. and 16. 8.

But there will arise here some Objections to be answered.

Ob. 1. It may be Objected. That the way to heaven is a narrow way, that few
find it, the Gate into it straight, that few enter into it. That many shall
strive to enter into it, and shall not be able to enter. That the life of a
Christian is a dangerous and painful life, like to the life of a Soldier,
Pilgrim, Travailer, Husbandman, or painful labourer. And that violence must be
used to get into Heaven, or we cannot come there. And that he that gets in
there, must not only fight for it, but overcome, Luke 3. 24. Ephesians: 6. 16. and
1. 19. 2 Timothy: 4. 7. Mat: 11. 12. and therefore they infer that great measures
of Grace are absolutely necessary to an estate of Grace.

Ans: To which we Answer. That the Antecedent is confessed to be true. And the
same is much more lively manifested in the weak then in the strong Christian,
in him that has little, then in him that has much Grace. As in the Soldier,
Husbandman, Travailer, or Labourer, that notwithstanding his sickness,
weakness, faintness, or other distempers, yet he fights still, he goes on
his Journey still, he does his days work for all this, but with the more
strife, danger, pain, and violence. And yet they go on conquering and to
conquer, and shall obtain a full victory at the last. But the consequence is
false, for the lowest, weakest, smallest degree and measure of true grace, will
so really, constantly, and victoriously, oppose sin as light opposes
darkness, or truth opposes falsehood, and therefore the lowest degree of
Grace, puts a man into an estate of grace, which will end in eternal glory.

Ob. 2. Oh but Christ's disciples must be able to leave Father and Mother, Wife
and life, and all for his sake, Mat. 11. 37. He that loves Father or Mother
more then me, is not worthy of me: And he that loves Son or Daughter more
then me, is not worthy of me. And he that takes not up his Cross and
follows after me is not worthy of me. Luke 14. 26. If any man come to me, and
hate not his Father and Mother, Wife and Children, and Brethren and Sisters,
and his own life also, he cannot be my Disciple.

Ans. To this we answer, 1. That many of these speeches of Christ, are
Hyperbolicall, or Catechresticall, and may not be taken according to the letter
by any means, as Matt. 5. 33. Swear not at all. 39. 40. etc. Whosoever shall
smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also, etc And so here the
words are not simply to be understood. Christ does not teach men to be
unnatural to themselves, or their relations, against the Law of God and
nature, for this were to teach contrary to himself, and all his teachings by
himself and his Apostles elsewhere. But that he means, by this is with
respect to the present and succeeding times of Persecution, in which case if it
come to the Question, that they must either deny, and so leave and loose
Christ, or they must leave and loose Father and Mother, Wife, life and all, in
this case they must be ready to leave and loose them, and must leave them all
for Christ's sake. As we are to love God above all, so we are to leave all for
Gods sake. And he that so does, shall be rewarded here and hereafter. Matt. 19.
29. Mark 10. 28, 29. etc. And such as fear God in such a case, are so far
from having great measures of Grace, that they have not the least measure of
Grace, no not as of a grain of mustard seed, and are not worthy of him indeed,
and will go without him, Mat: 22. 8. 2. The words (worthy of me) in this
place, as in diverse others we conceive they do intend no more but this, they
are not meet or fit for my service, to be my Disciples, to be accounted
gracious. so the words are taken in Luke 7. 4. and 20. 35. and 21. 36. Mat. 3.
8. Acts 5. 41. 3. We grant 1. that the true Christian ought so to love God and
Christ at all times. 2. That it is in the nature of true Grace so to do. 3.
That the true Christian does earnestly desire and labor to attain to this
perfection. And 4. He shall attain to this perfection at the last.

Ob. 3. It may be farther objected, that it is admitted of a Hypocrite, that he
has true Grace, Ma. 13. 12. From him shall be taken away even that he has.

Ans. For answer hereunto, we say, 1. That the Scripture does oftimes speak
according to men's opinion of things. 2. He may have truly the temporary grace
which is the grace of the Hypocrite, and very like to the saving grace of the
elect of God, and therefore he is said to have it. 2. He thinks he has true
grace, and will not be persuaded to the contrary, as one of a thing he
dreameth. 3. That the Hypocrite himself (be he here a member of a true visible
Church, and never so glorious a professor) is in Gods account, and in truth, no
Christian, no more then the picture of a man is a man. Nor is part of Christ's
mystical body, more then an artificial Eye, Tooth, or Leg, is a part of the
body to which it is annexed: And yet for his outward appearance, he is said to
be in Christ, Io. 15. 2. Every Branch in me that bears not fruit etc. Romans 2
17. Matt. 23. 27. Ye are like painted Sepulchers, which appear beautiful etc.
Romans 2. 28, 29. He is not a Jew that is one outwardly etc. Rev. 2. 9. Them that
say they are Jews and are not etc. Rev. 2. 2. and 3. 9. That the works done by
the Hypocrite, albeit they are sometimes said to be works done because they
seem so to others, and so they think themselves, Psalm. 78. 35, 36. Yet are they
not works really and truly done, nor done to or for God: and therefore he does
look upon, and account of them as works not done at all, or as evil deeds,
Hosea 10. 1. Israel is an empty vine etc. Esaias 1. 11. To what purpose is the
multitude of your sacrifices etc. Who has required this at your hands, etc.
Bring no more vain oblations etc. Esaias 58. 5. Is this the fast that I have
chosen etc. Zach. 7. 6. When ye fasted etc. did ye at all fast unto me, even to
me, And when ye did Eat, and when ye drink (in your holy feasts) did ye not Eat
for your selves, and drink for your selves. Hos. 7. 14. They have not cried
unto me when they howled etc. For as the prayer of the heart not uttered by
the mouth, is notwithstanding a Prayer in Gods account, so the Prayer of the
tongue not in the heart, may be said to be no Prayer to God at all, 1 Samuel: 1.
13. In this sense Romans 2. 28. it is said that Circumcision outward and not in
the heart, is no Circumcision. And so for the common Graces or gifts that are
in the heart of an Hypocrite, albeit they be sometimes for the likeness they
have to the true Graces, called by their names, Esaias 48. 2. Io: 2. 23. Esaias 58.
2. Micha 3 11, 17. yet coming from an evil man, and out of an evil heart,
they cannot be good, Mat: 7. 11. and 12. 35 The Lord does not account of them,
nor are they to be esteemed in a Theological or spiritual sense, as any
Graces at all, no more then painted fire is fire, or a thing a man does fancy
in his dream, the thing it self: or counterfeit coin true coin. And as God
herein takes the will for the deed, in that which is not, so in that which is,
the deed without the will not to be at all, hence it is Io. 6. 64, 70. that
Judas albeit he had a temporary faith, yet he is said not to believe. But for
the Text objected in Mat. 23. 24. That from him that has not (that has not
indeed) shall be taken what he has. These words are in Luke 8. 18. Resolved
and expounded thus, And whosoever has not from him shall be taken even that
which he seems to have (or thinks) he has.

Ob. It may perhaps be farther objected, that the oil which the foolish
Virgins (that were Hypocrites) had, was the same kind of oil which the wise
Virgins had, Matt. 25. 1, 2. etc.

Ans. For Answer to this we say, 1. That Theologica parabolica non est
argumentativa. 2. That it is true, that the text says, that the foolish
Virgins had oil in their Lamps, but it cannot appear by the text, to be of
the same kind of oil that the wise Virgins had. Nor is it probable to be so,
for the wise had their supply about them, but the foolish theirs from without
them. We grant the Hypocrite to have seeming Grace or gifts, but not of the
same kind with the true Christian, whose oil is of another kind, fed by the
spirit of God within him, which spirit the Hypocrite has not; His seeming
grace, has no rooting, as the feed of the stony and High way ground, and the
building on the sand. It has not the causes of the true Graces, that are in
the heart of the true Christian, it is not so rooted and bottomed upon Christ
and his spirit, it works not so downward, to break and humble the heart for
sin, and that out of a deep sense of the love of God and Christ, so as to
engage and fasten in it a root and foundation of love toward God, and his
people, for his sake, that can never be razed out, but will be increasing and
growing still, according to the promise of our Savior, Ioh. 14. 16. 17. And I
will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may
abide with you for ever. The Hypocrite is a tree that bears fruit like as the
true Christian does, but not a good tree, and therefore brings not forth good
fruit, as the true Christian does; But the common grace of the Hypocrite, is a
loose and slight piece of work in the soul, an opinion and fancy of Faith,
Joy, and Peace, like to a building on the Sand, and to a rootlesse plant,
standing on his own bottom and loose, and not engrafted into the tree. Without
any true love to Christ, sense of sin, change of the heart, or any such like
thing, and therefore will not stand under any storm, will not abide any
Temptation. but will fall down, dry and wither away and come to naught.

Ob. But it may perhaps be farther objected, out of the Parable of the diverse
sorts of hearers, Mat: 13. That the same kind of grace that was in the bad
hearers, was also in the good hearer, and differed only in degrees?

Ans. To this we answer. That the scope of that Parable, is only to comfort,
and satisfy the Disciples, as touching the fewness of them that did receive
the Gospel, and profit by the Preaching thereof; And it was to lay open the
various effects of the Preaching of the Gospel, the means of begetting, and
increase of the saving grace of Gods elect, and of the common grace of the
Hypocrite, by the comparison of the Sower, and his sowing of seed corn in the
ground. That the effect thereof is various, according to the ground in which it
is cast. That where the word falls into a stony heart, Ezech. 36. 26. and a
heart lost in the love of the world, Jer. 4. 4, James 4 4. 1 Jo. 2. 19. Which
is always a wicked heart, there it is fruitless and lost. But where the word
meets with a good and honest heart, which is a heart broken, and contrite for
sin, and a heart that loves God more then the world, of which there are few,
there it does bring forth more or less fruit. So that the seed sown in all
the grounds, is the same, but the fruit not the same, for the bad ground, it is
said of the seed sown in it, that it had no root, and that it brought forth no
fruit. So that although it be the same word that works the common grace in the
Hypocrite, and the special grace in the Elect, yet that which is wrought
thereby in one, is not the same that is wrought in another hearer thereof, 2
Cor: 2. 16.

And now by all this that has been said it may appear, that Sincerity lies
more in the quality and nature, then in the quantity and measure of the thing.
But there will be something more added, we hope, for the clearing of this
point, by a better hand, in the last Chapter of this book. And therefore we
shall leave it in this place and proceed

We have done now with the explicatory, and shall come next to the Applicatory
part of our discourse. And out of what has been already said, may we not now
draw up this conclusion. That there is great cause to suspect, That Sincerity
toward God, and Christ amongst the Professors of the Christian Religion is
rare, and that the Sincere Professors thereof are few. But that Hypocrisy
amongst these professors is very common, and that the false Professors thereof
are very many. And now we shall make some Inferences, and uses of that we have
formerly laid down.

CAP. V.
Wherein the true Christian and Hypocrite may agree, And how far the
Hypocrite may go.

SECT. I.
ANd now we shall make some Inferences upon, and improvement of all that we
have said in our Explicatory part.

The first improvement we shall make of these things we have laid down, shall
be; For the trial of our selves upon these heads. 1. How far an Hypocrite
may go in his persuasion, practice, and performance. Or what he may be or have
within, or do without him, that the true Christian is, has, and does. 2 What
is lacking in him, and what the true Christian is, must be, have, and do more
then the Hypocrite; And wherein he does go beyond, and excel him. And then
secondly, for the trial of our works and services. 1. For the first. 1. This
is agreed in the general by all men, That a man may be not only almost, but
altogether (at least in his persuasion) converted from being a Jew, Turk, or
Heathen, to be a Christian; from being a Papist or other Heretic, to be a
Protestant and Orthodox, from being profane and unrighteous, to be a moral or
civil man, from being an Atheist or irreligious, to be a Formalist, or a man
seemingly Religious, and all this by the Preaching of the Gospel, and yet be
an Hypocrite: So Judas Mat. 27. 1, 2 etc. Simon Magus, Acts 8. 1, 2 etc. and
many others. Acts 5. 1, 2 Mat. 23. 15.

2, The Hypocrite may be as rich, honorable, and prosperous in the world, as
the true Christian, Psalm. 52. 1, 2. 1 Samuel 22. 9.

3. He may come of a Godly Parentage, and have a Godly education, Phil: 3. 4,
5. Acts 22. 3.

4. The Hypocrite may have and enjoy as much in the outward Ordinances and
Privileges of the Church, as the true Christian may have and enjoy, 1 Cor. 10.
1, 2. 9. 4, 5. Moreover brethren, I would not that you should be ignorant, how
that all our Fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the Sea. And
were all Baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the Sea, and did all eat the
same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink, for they
drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ,
(that is to say) that the Fathers did (upon the matter) enjoy the same
spiritual benefits, and outward Sacraments.) But with many of them God was not
well pleased, etc. Heb: 3. 18, 26. But some when they heard did provoke etc.
And to whom did he swear etc. but to them that believed not. Luke 13. 25, 26,
27. When the Master is up and has shut the door etc. and ye begin to stand
without, and to knock, saying Lord; Lord, open to us: And he shall answer and
say, I know you not whence ye are, then shall ye begin to say. We have eaten
and drank in thy presence, and thou have taught in our streets. But he shall
say, I tell you I know not whence ye are. Heb. 4. 2. For unto us was the
Gospel Preached, as well as unto them, but the word Preached did not profit
them, etc. Jude 4. Acts 22 3.

5, The Hypocrite may have as great a share in the Manifestation of Gods
presence with a people by outward protections, deliverances, Salvations, and
Mercies, as the true Christian may have. Jude v. 5. I shall therefore put you
in remembrance, though ye once knew it: how that the Lord having saved the
people out of the Land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. 1
Cor: 10. 1, 2, etc.

6. The Hypocrite for his outward station and condition, may be placed as nigh
to God as the best Christian may be. He may be the chief officer of a Church,
or a Nation, or the like, Jude v. 5. And the Angels which kept not their first
estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains
under darkness, etc. So Judas Rev. 2. Demas, Philemon 24. and others. But more
particularly.

SECT. II.
How far the Hypocrite may go in his outside, with the true Christian.

The Hypocrite as to his practice and performance, and for his outside and
appearance therein, may be visibly changed into another man, 1 Samuel: 10. 6. He
can and may do as much and go as far as the best Christian whatsoever. Nay
he may possibly do and suffer as much, and in appearance before men, with as
great, and as much Spirit and zeal as any man. Yea seem more glorious, and for
matter and manner both, go beyond the best Christian, as the luster of false
gold, may exceed the luster of true gold; and as an Artificial picture, and
painted face, may excel the natural face; and as a Stage Player may more
lively act a man, or thing said or done, then the man or thing he does act to
be said or done; He may therefore leave not only some, but all the outward
evils of his life, and do in appearance all that is good, he may seem to deny
all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and live soberly, righteously and Godly,
and so in show, make a complete outward reformation. He may take up the whole
form of Godliness and Religion, go round from day to day, in the practice of
piety, keep the Sabbath, Pray, hear, read, confer, expound, receive the
Sacraments, Fast and pray, and do all other duties public and private,
incumbent on a Christian, he may seem good amongst good, as Saul, 1 Samuel: 10.
10. and better then most of the best of the time, and place as he did, 1 Samuel
14. 33, 34. observe all Gods commands, and desire to know what is lacking, Mat.
19. 20. In a way of Religion, he may advance far, and go beyond others,
comply with the design of Christians, and profess, and do as the true
Christian: and so doing hold out till Christ come, Mat. 25. And be drawn to all
this by the operation of the word; so that for his outside. he may seem to be
as glorious as the house built upon the Rock, Mat: 7. 24, 25, 26, 27. and as
fair for heaven as the wise Virgins, Mat. 25. 1, 2, 3. etc. Gal: 1. 13, 14. Ye
have heard of my conversation in time past, in the Jews Religion, etc. and
profited above many of my equals. Phill. 3. 4, 5, 6. If any other man thinks
he has whereof he might trust in the flesh. I more. Circumcised the 8th day
etc. touching the Law a Pharisee, concerning zeal persecuting the Church.
touching the righteousness which is in the Law blameless. 2 Pet. 2 20. For if
after they have escaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of
the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they be again entangled and overcome, etc.
it happens to them according to the Proverb. The Sow that was washed to be
wallowing in the mire. Mat: 12. 43, 44, 45. So the foolish Virgins, Mat. 25. 1,
2, 3, etc. The man not having on the wedding garment, Mat. 22. 11, 12. The
young man, Mat. 19. 20. The pharisee Luke 18. 11, 12. Herod, Mark 6. 20. Ioash,
2 Chronicles. 24. 25, 26. But yet more particularly for this Outwork. 1. The
Hypocrite being a master of a Family, or Magistrate, he may go very far, and
do and suffer very much in the work of Reformation, for the suppressing of
evil, and the advancement of good: so did Iehu 2 Kings 10. 16, 17, 18. etc. v.
29, 30. and Ioash, 2 Chronicles, 23. 1, 2, etc. 2. And being a Minister or other
Officer of the Church, he may Preach, or write, or both, as much, and as well
for the truth, as any man, and seem very zealous therein; And thereby, or
otherwise in Government of the Church, he may be very active, and do very much
toward the advancement of Christ's, and overthrow of Satan's Kingdom: So Judas
Mat. 10. 1, 2. etc. Luke 9. 1, 2, etc. Demas Coll. 4. 14. 2 Timothy 4. 10.
Philemon 24. And for any man he being publicly trusted, he may be faithful to
his trust in any public work, Esaias 8. 2. Nehem: 13. 13. 3. A man may be
externally called, Heb. 3. 1, 2. Or be converted to Christianity, 1 Timothy 1. 20.
1 Cor: 1. 2, 3, etc. He may be Baptized, 1 Timothy 1. 20. Acts 8. 9, 13, 18. He
may make a public confession of his Sins, and of particular Sins, and of
his Faith in Christ, and his voluntary subjection to him, 1 Timothy: 1. 20. 1 Cor:
5. 1, 20. Mat. 7. 22. 23. 1 Samuel: 15. 24, 30. Mat. 3. 16. compared with Io. 5.
35. He may be convinced, that a Church of Christ is a blessed Society, and upon
this become a member of a visible and pure Church, and walk orderly by Christ's
rule therein, 1 Timothy: 1. 20. Phill: 1. 5. 1 Cor: 5. 1, 2, 3. All this must needs
be true of them who were cast out of the Church, for they could not have been
cast out, if they ^^d not been in the Church, 1 Io. 2. 19. He may be a bold
Professor of the Faith, Acts 16. 17. Mat. 25. 1, 2, 3, 4. etc. He may associate
himself with Saints, Mat: 25. 1, 2, 3. He may dispense the Sacraments,
divinely and purely. He may Preach the word by voice, or pen, or both, have a
singular gift, and take much pains therein, 1 Cor. 13. 1. Luk 9. 1, 2. Mat. 7.
22. Many will say to me in that day Lord Lord, etc. then will I profess unto
them I never knew you, etc. And in his Preaching, or writing, he may be a sharp
reprover of Sin, he may cry out against the prophanenes of the wicked, civil
honesty, and Hypocrisy of others, coldness of the best. And perhaps say very
much against Hypocrisy it self, Io. 12. 3, 4, 5, 6. Mat: 7. 3, 4, 5. He may
partake of the Lords Supper. Luke 13. 25, 26. And ye shall knock and say, Lord
open to us. And he shall answer, I know you not whence ye are, then shall ye
begin to say, we have eaten and drank in thy presence, and thou have taught in
our streets. But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not, whence ye are,
depart from me, etc. He may hear and repeat Sermons, Heb. 4. 1, 2. Perhaps
hear and delight to hear, the best and most searching Preachers, Io. 5. 35.
He may read and study the Scriptures much, so did the Pharisees, and were by
this means exceeding skillful therein, He may Prophesy or expound Scriptures,
and have a great gift, and take much pains therein, 1 Cor: 13. 2. And though I
have the gift of Prophesy etc. He may pray and pray much, and fast and pray,
and fast and pray often, and have a singular gift of the Spirit in prayer, and
make long prayers, and seem very devout therein, 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2. Though I
speak (to God or man) with the tongue of Angels etc. Mat. 23. 14. and 9. 14.
Luke 11. 1. He may use to pray alone or perhaps in private, Luke 11. 10. and
18. 10. But see more for the proof of all these things Mat. 10. 7. 1 Cor. 5.
1, 2, etc. Romans 2. 20. 1 Timothy 4. 16. etc. Luke 22. 14, 15, 16, etc. 2 Timothy 4.
10. Isa. 1. 11, 15. Mark 3. 12, 19. He may in all this service of God be very
diligent and industrious, Esaias 58. 2. Yet they seek me daily, and delight to
know my ways, as a Nation that did Righteousness, and forsook not the
Ordinances of their God, they ask of me the Ordinances of Justice, they take
delight in approaching to God. He may in case of some trouble, or upon some
other special occasion, make a solemn engagement to God and man, of amendment
of life, and in especial to forbear such and such things, or do such and such
duties, Psalm: 78. 34, 35, 36. He may have or seem to have, and take some
delight in all these things, Isa. 58. 2, 3. He may do as much in the outworke,
or upon the outward man, in mortification and self-denial, by fasting and the
like; and go as far in appearance of like zeal, and devotion without by
Tears etc. as any true Christian shall do, Mat. 6. 16. so Jehu and Paul when
a Pharisee, Phill. 3. 6. Acts 22. 3. He may bestow much to good uses, and do
many singular good works, He may build Churches, give maintenance to Ministers
for Preaching, give to the poor, and the like,: Yea he may give all that he
has to such uses, 1 Cor. 13. 3. And though I give all my goods to feed the
Poor, and have not love, it profits me nothing, Acts 5. 1. Ananias gave his
estate. And in all these things he may seem to be the most forward of all
others, as was Joash 2 Chronicles. 24. 4, 5, 6. And in all his external carriage,
he may seem to seek after, and to follow Christ fully, John 6. 2, 26, 66. and
7. 34, 36. Mat. 19. 22. And this he may continue to do all the time of his
life, Mat. 25. 11. Mat. 19. 20. And for this he may suffer much persecution all
his life time, and at the last dye in the defense of the Truth as a Martyr, as
the thorny ground hearers, Mat. 13. 21, 22. 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2. And though I give
my body to be burnt, and have not Love, it profits me nothing. See for these
things, 1 Timothy: 1. 19, 20. 2 Timothy 4. 14, 15. Acts 6. 5. Rev. 2. 15. Gal. 3. 4.

Ob. Against this it is objected out of Mat. 13. 21. that in time of
persecution they fall away.

Ans. This is meant of the one sort of hearers that are represented by the
stony ground, not them that are noted by the thorny ground, which went farther
and endured the scorching of the Sun, and fell away after. 5. And when there
were extraordinary gifts in the Church, as when there was the gift of Miracles,
extraordinary Prophesy or the like, the Hypocrite had as large a share therein,
as the true Christian had, Mat. 7. 22. 1 Cor: 13. 2. Thus a man may strive to
enter, and not be able, Luke 13. 24. And so near he may come to the Kingdom
of God, and yet go without it, Mark 12. 34. And how many that are called
Christians, come short of this?

SECT. III.
How far the Hypocrite may go in his Inside with the true Christian.

But the Hypocrite, whose heart is yet unchanged, may go farther, and nearer
to the Kingdom of God (which is within) To: 14. 17. then all this, and yet
come short of it. For he may be another man as Saul was 1 Samuel 10. 9. he may be
seemingly regenerate, come very near to, or have the semblance of all the
saving graces, and works of the true Christian in the soul. And therefore
there are found in some of their hearts, all these following things.

In his Illumination.
1. Illumination. He may not only hear, but receive, and entertain the word,
Luke 8. 12, 13, 14. And have as much of the speculative knowledge of God and
Christ, the word of God and Gospel, as is in any true Christian, 1 Cor. 13. 2.
And though I understand all mysteries, and all knowledge etc. and have not
love, I am nothing, Heb. 6. 4. It is impossible for those who were once
enlightened, etc. Rom: 2. 18, 20. Io. 3. 10. 2 Pe. 2. 20. Numb. 24. 3, 4.

In his Memory.
2. He may have as good a memory to retain the things that he does know of God
and Christ, as the true Christian has. He may by the frequent exercise of it
about Heavenly things improve it so, as to be able to repeat a Sermon by it,
which seems to be implied, 1 Cor. 13. 2.

In his Soundness of Opinion.
3. He may be as Orthodox and sound in his Judgment about the things of God,
as the best Christian, Rom: 2. 20. Rev. 2. 13.

In his zeal against the Heterodox.
4. He may in (appearance) be as zealous against them that are unsound and
Heterodox in judgment as the best Christian may be, Rev. 2. 3, 4. Phill. 3. 4,
5.

In his Self conviction.
5. He may have a large conviction upon his Spirit, as to his Judgment and
Reason, he may be, as Judgment, Reason, and Persuasion.
much for good, and all that is good, as the true Christian, and he may go
very far in his persuasion. He may be convinced in his judgment and
persuasion of all these things. 1. The sinfulness of his own ways, Romans 2. 15.
Which show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience also
bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing
one another, Judas, Mat. 27. 3. 2. Of the dangerous consequenses of his sin,
Rom: 2. 15. 1. 32. Who knowing the judgment of God that they which commit such
things are worthy of Death. etc. 3. That there is a necessity of a change. 4.
Of the Equity and reasonableness of Gods ways and commands. 5. Of the
sweetness and goodness of Gods ways. 6. Of the truth of his promises and
threatenings. 7. He may have strong inclinations to close with Christ, but upon
his own and not upon Christ's terms. 8. He may be persuaded and resolved to
close fully with Christ, and to comply wholly with his will hereafter, but not
yet; Or to do it presently, but not in all times, places and things; or to do
all his will in the outside and form, but not in reality and Truth. See for
proof of all this, Luke 8. 13, 14. Heb. 6. 5. Mark 6. 20. Mat. 3. 6. Rev. 3.
15. Hosea 7. 8. Luke 9. 59. 61. 57. Ezech. 33. 31. 32. compared with Ezech. 8.
7, 8, 9.

In his Repentance.
6. He may hereupon have some shakings and tremblings of heart, or a heart
wounded for sin be under the fear of eternal vengeance, and have a kind of
Repentance for his sin, as Judas Mat. 27. 3. I have sinned etc. Psalm. 78. 34,
35, 36. Saul 1 Samuel 15. 24, 30, I have sinned etc.

In his fear of God.
7. He may fear the Lord and his judgments. James 2. 19. The Devils believe
and tremble. Esaias 33. 13, 14. 15. The sinners in Zion are afraid, fearfulness
has surprised the Hypocrites, Who among us shall dwell with devouring fire?
etc Exodus 14. 31.

In his delight in the word of God.
8. He may have some delight in the word of God, he reads and hears, and he
may desire and delight in the best Preachers and Preaching, Heb. 6. 5. It is
impossible for such as are enlightened, have tasted, (that is to say) the
sweetness of the good word of God, If they fall away etc. Luke 8. 13. They on
the Rock are they who when they hear, receive the word with joy. Ioh. 5. 35.
Christ speaks to the Jews of John the Baptist, and his Ministry, He was a
burning and a shining light, And you were willing for a season to rejoice in
that light. And it is said of Herod, that he feared John and heard him gladly.
Mark 6. 20. Ezekiel. 33. 32. And Lo, thou art unto them a very lively song of
one that has a pleasant voice, or can play with an instrument, for they hear
thy words and do them not, Esaias 58. 23.

9. He may perhaps be devout indeed, and take much delight in the service of
God, Esaias 58. 2 Or he may at least seem to do so, Esaias 58. 2 Jer. 7. 9.

In his Faith.
10. He may have an Historical Faith, give assent to, and believe the truth of
the whole word of God, James 2, 19. The Devils believe and tremble.

11. He may not only hear, but entertain and feel^ the word quick and
powerful, and have some false persuasion or fancy, that the promise of the
Gospel does belong to him, and that Christ and Salvation by him is his, Luke
8. 13. They on the Rock are they which when they hear, receive the word with
joy, and have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of Temptation
fall away. Io 2. 23, 24. Many believe in his name, etc. But Jesus did not
commit himself to them, for he knew what was in man, etc. Ezekiel. 33. 31, 32.
Acts 8. 13. Simon himself believed also, v. 19. 20, 21. etc. Io: 4. 41, 42,
45, 46, 48. etc.

In his Peace of Conscience, joy, etc.
12. He may, from the discovery made to his soul, of the blessed estate of the
Believers, and the false persuasion of his heart, bred and fed by Satan and his
own flattery of himself, that he is one of them, and shall have his part in
heaven with them, have some slight impressions of joy within him, and some kind
of peace of Conscience, He may have a kind of hope and patience, to wait and
look for the thing he does believe he shall have: And by all this, think that
his estate is very good, and better then other men's. And for the proof of all
these things see Mat. 13 20, 21. But he that received the seed into stony
places, the same is he that bears the word, and anon with joy receives it,
yet has he not root in himself, Io. 5. 35. They did for a season rejoice in
the light, etc. Heb. 6. 4, 5. For it is impossible for those who were once
enlightened, (that is) that are instructed by the Gospel of Christ, in the way
of salvation by Christ, Ephesians: 1. 18. (And have tasted) that is, have had a
little relish of the word, whose heart and affection is for a time taken with
the newness and pleasantness of the Christian doctrine, and has some
transient motion by it, or general disposition toward Christ in it, a Taste
like that the Cook has by dipping his finger in the dish, and the licking of
it, that is not fed or strengthened by it, or like as the child that catches at
the breast, and does not suck, is never the better for it. [The heavenly gift]
That is, either Christ the gift of God, Io. 4. 10. Or the heavenly calling,
Heb: 3. 1. or a Temporary Faith (which seems to be all one) for Christ by Faith
received, is the only food of the Soul Jo. 4. 14. and 6. 33, 35. And by this
does the soul live, as the body does by the receiving in of its natural food.
[And were made partakers of the Holy Ghost] that is, Either of the common work
and operation thereof in general, or such extraordinary gifts thereof, which
the Church had for that time, for the present necessity thereof, as Miracles,
Prophesy, and happily some inward Revelations and Inspirations that do not
continue to this day in ordinary with the Church. [And have tasted the good
word of God] (that is) ha^h some passionate apprehensions of the necessity,
goodness, sweetness and profit of Christ, the subject of it, and the Gospel
and promises of Christ, etc. and some groundless persuasion that it belongs to
him, he has a little relish hereof, as a child that will not, or cannot take
the breast, and does but snatch at it, has only a taste of it, and is not fed,
and nourished by it, as the child is that does hold, and suck its belly full.
As the true believer; who does so desire and receive the word, that he does
grow thereby, 2 Pe. 2. 2. [And the powers of the world to come.] (that is)
which has had a taste, (which must be supplied) of the powers of the world to
come. By these words some understand, all the Spiritual blessings, and
Privileges of the Gospel Church, as a taste of Christ, the common gifts of the
spirit; outward, Prophesy, Prayer, and the like: Inward, as Faith, Hope, Joy,
and the like. And others understand by it the joys of Heaven. And so that as
the Israelites did taste of the fruits of the Land of Canaan, and never came
there to eat thereof; So some Hypocrites may have some little taste of the jove's
of Heaven, that shall never come there. And in both senses, but especially in
this last sense it seems to be thus far intended, that upon his contemplation
of Heaven, he may be in a rapture: the other things being included in the
former words. See for this Mat. 13. 20, 21, 22. Numb: 23. 10. and 24. 2, 3,
etc. and 13. 26. and 14. 27. etc.

In his love of God.
13. He may perhaps hereupon, or for some other good felt, apprehended, or
hoped for by him from God, have some seeming love to God and Christ, 2 Timothy: 3.
4. Ephesians. 6. 24.

In his Love of the Godly.
He may also have some seeming love to, and delight in the company of the
Saints, and true Christians; so the foolish Virgins seem to have a love to, and
delight in the fellowship of the wise Virgins, Mat: 25. 1, 2, 3. etc.

In his Love of Ordinances.
14. He may also have some seeming love to, and delight in the Ordinances of
God, Ezekiel. 33. 31. Esaias 58, 2. Yet they seek me daily and delight to know my
ways, etc. Mat. 13. 20, 21.

In his Love of Graces.
15. He may have some seeming love to, and some desire after the Gifts and
Graces of Gods Spirit, Mat: 25. 1, 2, 6. etc. So the foolish Virgins seemed to
desire the oil of the wise Virgins, Acts 8. 18, 19.

16. He may seem to lament after God, and after the visible signs and
manifestations of his presence departed from him, 1 Samuel: 28. 15.

In his other seeming Graces.
17. He may perhaps get some appearance of all the other gifts and graces of
the Spirit, as Humility, Mercy, Meekness, Patience, and the like. For there is
no kind of grace or duty required by God, but there is a like to it, nor work
done by the true Christian, but the Hypocrite can imitate. Therefore we find a
like to true Faith, Repentance and Love. And the Hypocrite may be persuaded,
that he has indeed those very graces, and does indeed those very works, as the
foolish Virgins, Mat. 25. 1, 2, etc.

In a growth of Grace.
16. He may in appearance thrive, and grow herein toward perfection: As the
three sorts of bad hearers did, Luke 8. 12, 13, 14. etc. and Mat. 13. 25.

17. And by all this he may get a great name and esteem amongst men, for a
true Christian, Mat. 25. 1, 2. etc.

18. And he may thus continue without any suspicion to his dying day, Luke 25.
11. and 13. 25, 26, 27, 28. But for the farther clearing of all these last
named particulars within this Section. See Numb: 23. 10. Let me dye the death
of the Righteous. Numb. 24. 2, 3, etc. 1 Cor: 11. 30, 31, 32. For this cause
many are weak etc. If we would judge our selves etc. but when we are judged,
we are chastned of the Lord, that we be not condemned etc. which would seem to
have this intimation, that notwithstanding all your gifts, Parts, and progress
in Christianity, if you have secret evils, and do not labor to find them out,
and judge your selves for them, you may be condemned with the world, 1 Cor: 15.
19. If in this life only we have hope in Christ etc. which words seem to imply
thus much, That if all our Parts, gifts, desires, works, etc. reach and look no
farther, and last no longer, then for this present life, that our Faith, Hope,
etc. be but temporary moved from, and carried to something that is not beyond
this life, we are in a sad case, it will do us no more good then the wealth
glory, and good things which Dives had, Luke 16. 25. Io. 6. 27. 1 Cor: 13. 8,
13. 1 Pet. 1. 22, 24, 25. Seeing ye have purified, etc. Being borne again not
of Corruptible seed etc. By which words are intimated thus much, That, unless
you manifest the work of the spirit within you, in obedience to the truth, by
having your hearts purifyed, and by an unfeyned, pure, and fervent love of the
Saints, beyond that work which is wrought in the hearts of Hypocrites, you will
not have the evidence within you of that Regeneration which is true, and
effectually wrought of God by his spirit through the word, by which there is
effected an immortal seed of Grace that abides for ever. But if it be only
some moral virtues, or common gifts, be they never so excellent and glorious,
that have the face of the new Creature, and he in whom they are, be not a new
Creature indeed, they are reckoned with God but as flesh, which is as gr^sse,
and the flower of the field, they will do a man no more good, nor last any
longer then riches, honors, and such like things, which are but for this life
only, Phil. 3. 4, 5. 2 Pe. 3. 4 It is said, Psalm: 106. 11, 12. then believed
they his words. (that is) when they had seen such signal manifestations of
Gods power, and working for them against their enemies, they were for the
present as full of Faith in God, his promise and joy, as a bladder of wind,
they soon forgot etc. it had no root nor well grounded principle, they fell
back. But lusted exceedingly etc. Mat. 13. 21, 22. Phill: 3. 4, 5, 19. 1 Timothy:
6. 5. 2 Pe. 3, 4. Exodus: 14. 31. compared with 15. 23, 24. Numb. 13. 26, 27.
etc. 14. 1. 27. etc. And thus he may strive in his inward, as well as in his
outward man, to enter into heaven, and not be able, Luke 13. 24.

SECT. IV.
What it is that does carry the Hypocrite thus far. And why he goes no
farther.

If it be asked how it comes to pass, that an Hypocrite does go so far. We
answer. 1. That he may be drawn or driven to it by some or all of these
following means. 1. He may be drawn hereunto by the work of his natural
Conscience, Rom: 2. 15. Romans 1. 32. For when the Gentiles that have not the
law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, these having not the Law,
are a Law to themselves, which show the work of the Law written in their
hearts, their Consciences also bearing witness etc. Prove. 20. 27. The spirit
of a man is the Candle of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of the
belly. Or by occasion and reason of some eminent and miraculous work of God
done before their eyes, Io. 4. 41, 44, 45, 46. etc. Except ye see signs and
wonders ye will not believe; or by occasion of some eminent work of Gods
Providence done for his people, or against their enemies; or by the fear of
death, or some great affliction upon him, Psalm. 78. 34. When he flew them then
they sought him etc. Psalm. 106. 11, 12. And the waters covered their enemies
etc. then believed they his words, they sang his praise, they soon forgot his
works, etc. Or by occasion of some light breaking in, and some powerful
conviction upon the Conscience by the word and Spirit of God, whereby it is
pressed and moved to do what it does. Perhaps it cannot otherwise be in peace;
It may be it is convinced, there are some good and desirable things to be had,
and duties to be done in the profession of the Christian Faith, and happily it
may find more temporal good in such a life, then in a wicked loose life. 2. He
may be moved or brought hereunto by Education, discipline, or example of
Parents, or such like persons, under whom he has been brought up. So by
Education many Creatures have been brought to be quite contrary to their
nature, and so do many strange things: And by this means he has perhaps taken
in some truths, and taken up a profession, or customary practice of doing some
good. And by custom herein he has (as it were) gotten another nature, and now
does act almost as freely as he that acts Naturally by grace, and so he does
continue till by strength of temptation he be taken off, and so discovered Luke
8. 12, 13, 14. This seems to be the case of Joash, who continued good all the
days of Jehoiadah, 2 Kings 12. 2. This being that which moved him, when this
was gone, his Action ceased. 3. But there are many carnal and corrupt ends,
that draw in, and bring on so many into a profession of Religion, and that does
make them to engage so far, as to follow Christ a great way, and a great
while therein. For some enter into a profession of Religion out of a design,
and desire to do mischief in it. And this sometimes does make men act
vigorously, as if Religion were their principal aim; So some ^^ve joined
themselves to the Church of Christ, and preached and made profession of the
Gospel, of purpose to destroy the Gospel, and overthrow the Church of Christ,
Gal. 2. 4. False brethren, etc. who came in privily, etc. that they might bring
us into bondage, Phil: 1. 16, 17. Some preach Christ of envy etc. supposing to
add afflictions to my bonds: (that is) by drawing away the more to the
Profession of the Gospel, and so enraging the enemy the more against me, or
by exalting and preferring of themselves before me, so as to hinder the fruit
of my Ministry. Some engage in a profession of Religion, that thereby they
might cover some wickedness they are intending to do or in doing, Prove. 7.
14. 1 Kings 21. 9, 12. But most commonly and most men herein, are carried forth
in their profession of Religion from self love, to and for selfe-ends, as
selfe-praise or Applause, Acts 20. 30. Mat: 6. 2. Self honor or advancement,
Mat. 23. 6, 8. Selfe-greatnesse in office or command, James 3. 1. 1 Pet: 5. 3.
Mat: 23. 4, 5, 6, 7, Self profit or gain, Mat: 23. 14. 2 Pet. 2. 3.
Selfe-case, Mat. 23. 4 Self content, Gen 34. 18, 19. Selfe-pleasure, 2 Timothy 2.
3. and so to satisfy their lusts James 4. 3. There are many professors of the
Christian Religion now (as heretofore) that suppose gain to be Godliness, 1 Timothy: 6. 5. (that is) that the Religion which brings most worldly advantage, to
the professors thereon (...) the best Religion. And whose God is their belly
etc. who mind earthly things, Phill. 3. 18, 19. That serve not the Lord Jesus,
but their own bellyes, etc. Romans 16. 18. That serve the Creature more then the
Creator etc. Romans 1. 25. that are lovers of pleasure more then Lovers of God. 2 Timothy: 3. 4. That are lovers of their own selves etc. Men of corrupt minds, 2 Timothy 3. 2, 5, 7. That seek their own not the things of Jesus Christ, Phill: 2.
21. Phill: 1. 16, 17. That love the wages of unrighteousness, 2 Pet. 2. 15.
And these things, or some of them doubtless, were the things that carried
forth, and made so many followers and disciples of Christ in the days of his
flesh; They might see, and Historically believe what was prophesied of him, and
by this, and what they heard from, and saw in him, might expect he would be
great, and able to do great things for them; and some good they had at the
present by him. And this was it, that doubtless did make Judas engage so far
with him, Io. 6. 26. Io. 12. 6. And hereof Christ did sometimes give caution to
his Disciples, who were all of them a little sick of this disease, Io. 6. 27.
Mark 10. 14. Luke 18. 17. Mat. 18. 1. Luke 22, 24, 26. So that it is in the
state of the Kingdom of Christ, and where the Preaching of the Gospel is, as
where a man has a corrupt stomach, and all the meats, the purest and the best
he takes in, do corrupt in it. And as the Sun by his shining upon a stinking
dunghill, draws forth the smell, and does make the stink thereof to be the
more, and the greater: So the foulness and corruption of some men's hearts is
so great, and so much, that it corrupts all the pure truths of the word of God
that comes in it; And the word gives occasion to them, or rather they take
occasion by it, to show forth their heart-corruption the more; And to them it
is a savor of death unto death, 2 Cor: 2. 16. And where the preaching of the
Gospel is, there is begotten in man occasionally, and by accident, from the
same Gospel, and from the corruption of man's heart together, a Resolution to
become a Gospel professor, that is like to a false Conception, Phill. 1. 16. 2
Pet. 2. 3. out of which at last there is bred and brought forth by a seeming
act of Regeneration, a kind of changed or a new Creature, like to a false
Birth, one like to a Christian, but one that is no Christian indeed. And this
being made up of such corrupt matter, as the principles, foundation, and ends
thereof, (which are altogether carnal.) It is said to be a Birth of the flesh,
and the will of man, and not of God by his Spirit and word, as the Regeneration
of the true Christian is. Mat. 16. 16, 17. Io. 1. 13. 1 Pet. 1. 23, 24, 25. And
therefore these men as they are but dead pictures of the true Christian, so are
all the seeming works, gifts, and graces of such men, but the similitude and
appearance only of the graces and works of the true Christian, 2 Timothy 3 5.
Psalm. 78. 35, 36. And hence it is that they and their graces and works are said
to be carnal, temporal, perishing, for this life only; and of the nature of
all earthly things, which are but as grass, and the flower of the field that
withers and falls away, Io: 3. 6. That which is borne of the flesh is
flesh. (that is) carnal, and savoureth of the things of flesh and corrupt
nature: But that which is borne of the spirit is spirit: that is: is spiritual
and savoureth the things of the spirit, or of a nature renewed by the spirit, 1
Pet. 1. 21, 22. Being borne again not of corruptible seed, but of
Incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and abides for ever; for all
flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man, as the flower of the grass, the
grass withers etc, Phill: 3. 4, 5. If any man think he has whereof he
might trust in the flesh: I more, circumcised etc. 1 Cor: 15. 19. Mat: 13. 22,
23. Io. 6. 26. 1 Cor. 8. 13. 2 Cor. 1. 12. James 3. 15. Jude 19. And this
corrupt matter we speak of, has frequently a great influence upon men
professing Religion in their actings in public works, that whiles they act
much, and go very far therein, they are carried forth in it by some of these
sinister respects. So Rulers in Churches and Commonwealths in their work of
Ruling, and Preachers of the Gospel in their work of Preaching, whereof the
Prophet complains, Micah. 3: 11. The Heads judge for reward, and the Priests
thereof teach for hire, and the Prophets thereof Divine for money: yet lean
upon the Lord, etc. 2 Pet. 2. 15. To. 16. 18. And it is much to be feared, that
in this golden time, wherein it is with us, as it was with the Jews in the
time of Esther. Esther 8. 17. The Jews had joy and gladness, a feast, and a
good day, and many of the people of the land became Jews; For the fear of
them fell upon their enemies. So now the profession of the Gospel of Christ is
so much in request, that the same is the high way to advancement and favor. To
be a zealous able Preacher of the Gospel, or a careful painful Magistrate in
the Common wealth, after the example of the greatest men of the time, is a way
to bring much furtherance to a man's selfeends. And therefore it is to be
doubted, that these selfe-ends and sinister respects, may have a great
influence now upon some of the Preachers of the Gospel, That their engagement
therein, may be, and is, only, or especially, that they may be Rulers of
Congregations, masters of Assemblies, Lords over Gods Heritage, or for filthy
lucres sake, to have a livelihood, and maintenance to live by, and not to
glorify God, win the souls of men, feed the flock of Christ, and the like,
the which has been, and ought always to be, the main and principal motive of
the servants of Christ herein. 1 Timothy: 3 3, 8. 1 Pet: 5. 2. Tit. 1. 7, 11. 2
Cor. 4. 2. 1 Cor. 10. 33. Rom: 10. 11. Psalm: 78. 72. Io. 21. 15. 1 Pet: 5. 2.
And it is very probable that some of these corrupt ends have carried forth some
amongst us, that have of late times appeared so eminently, and singularly in
ways of new light, Quaking, and the like, that it has been to draw away
disciples after them, or some other such like advantage to be made thereby to
themselves: Jude 11. 2 Pet: 2. 3, 15. Acts 20. 30. If it be asked why the
Hypocrite does stick here, and go no farther, what is lacking, and how it is,
that he and the work wrought upon him, does miscarry, and why he does not hold
out, and come to perfection, as the sincere Christian does? We shall answer. 1.
He is not within the purpose of Gods Election in Christ, 1 Pet. 1. 2. Elect
according to the foreknowledge of God, etc. 2 Thessalonians. 2 13. 2. He never was
upon or within the foundation of Christ by Faith, Ephesians. 2. 20. 1 Cor. 3. 10.
Other foundation can no man lay, then what is laid Jesus Christ, Ephesians. 2. 20.
3. He never had the spring of the spirit of God within him, Io. 4. 13, 14. The
water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up to
everlasting life, Io 7. 38. He that believes on me, out of his belly shall
flow, etc. this he spoke of the Spirit that they that believe on him should
receive. 4. He has not within him that good and honest heart, compared to the
good ground, Mat. 13. 23. Which is the new heart promised, Ezech. 36. 26. 5. He
never had in him the true love of God, for that never fails, 1 Cor. 13. 8. 6.
He never did thoroughly know, because he did never thoroughly examine his own
heart and state, Io. 3. 20. 2 Cor. 13. 5. 7. He has too hastily, that is,
without good ground, taken in the apprehension of the promise of Christ, and
supposed him to be his, and so that his estate is sure, Mat. 25. 1, 2, 3. as
the foolish Virgins, Mat 7. 22. Luke 18. 21. 8. He did not when he first entered
upon the profession of Religion, sit down, and cast what it would cost him, and
provide accordingly, Luke 14. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. etc. And there went great
multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them, if any man come to me,
and hate not his Father etc. And whosoever does not bear his Cross, cannot be
my Disciple. For which of you intending to build a tower, sits not down
first and counts the cost etc. Or what King etc. So likewise whoever he be of
you, that forsakes not all that he has, he cannot be my Disciple. 9. He will
not go to the price, he will not be at the cost and pain required to have
Christ, he will not forsake all for him, sell all that he has to purchase him.
Mat. 6. 24. he would be content to serve Christ and the world together, but not
to leave the world for Christ's sake, Luke 18. 27, 28. Mat: 13. 46. Mat. 10. 37.
Mat. 19. 21. Go sell all that thou have, and come and follow me, etc. Mark.
10. 21. Luke 12. 33. and 22. 36. 10. He does sometimes take offense at the
cross of Christ, or meet with some other Temptation in his profession, that he
expected not, and was unprovided for, and thereupon falls away. Luke 8. 13.
They on the rock etc. And in time of temptation fall away. Mat: 13. 21. When
tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, by and by he is
offended. 11. He has rooted in his heart with the seeming, and ungrounded
good, so much grounded and and rooted evil, that it eats up, and destroys
all the seeming good that is there, Luke 8. 14. They that fell amongst thorns
etc. they go forth and are choked with cares, and riches, and pleasures of
this life. Mat: 13. 22. 12. The Hypocrite, and the work that is wrought upon
him, and in him, as it is wrought by man, and is of the will of man, and but an
external work, and all the work he does, is from corrupt principles, to
corrupt ends, so is it but carnal, and therefore corruptible, mortal and
perishing, and will not carry him that has it in him to everlasting life, no
more then Honors, Riches, meat and drink, and the like, which last but for
this life only, 1 Pe: 1. 22, 23. Phill. 3 3, 4, 5, 19. Acts 22. 3. 1 Timothy: 3. 5,
8. Io. 1. 12. 13. 2 Cor: 1. 12. Io. 3. 6. 1 Cor. 15. 19, 15. Io. 6 27. 2 Pet:
3. 4. and 2. 15. James 5. 2. Luke 12. 21, 25. and 16. 25, 26. Pro: 6. 16. Mat.
6. 19, 20. And it is not like to the true and saving work of Regeneration, and
of true grace in the true Christian, which is called Spiritual, To: 8. 6.
Life, To. 8. 6. the hidden man, 1 Pe. 3. 4. the true Treasure and Riches, Luke
16. 11. Mat. 6. 19, 20. James 2. 5. Heb: 11. 26. That which is wrought by God
himself, Mat. 16. 16, 17. by his Word and Spirit, Io. 3. 2, 3. etc. And that
which is incorruptible, 2 Pe. 3. 4. And that which will abide for ever, 1 Cor.
13. 8, 13. 1 Io, 3 9. 1 Pe. 1, 23, 24. And shall never perish, but endure to
everlasting life. Io. 6. 27. Heb. 10. 34. Eccl. 7. 12. It is therefore to be
observed, that in the parable of the seed sown in the bad ground amongst
thorns and briars, which is in an evil and Hypocritical heart, a heart of a
contrary making to the good and honest heart, that it miscarried, and never
came to any perfection. Luke 8. and Mat. 13.

CAP. VI.
Wherein the true Christian and Hypocrite differ. And how and wherein the true
Christian does go beyond the Hypocrite.

ALbeit there be (as we have showed) a very great agreement and likeness
between the true, and the counterfeit Christian, and between the common, and
special work of the Spirit in them, yet there is, and upon a narrow search,
there will be found a great and wide difference between them. Our next work
therefore shall be, to lay open this; wherein we shall lay down the true
differences of the operations that are in the one and in the other; And this we
shall do first generally, and then particularly. In the next place we shall
farther lay open those persons, (1.) by their outside, (2) By their inside.
(3.). By their inside and outside both together. This only we must premise,
that the true Christian must be, have, and do all that is good in the
Hypocrite; For a man cannot be a sincere Christian, and do in Sincerity what
he does, that does not seem to be a Christian at all, and that does nothing at
all of the work of a Christian; there cannot be Truth and a power, where there
is no form of Religion, for however it be true, that the form is many times
seen, without the power of Godliness, yet it is as true, that the power is
never seen without the form of Godliness, although all that does glister be
not gold, yet all gold does more or less glister. But in the true Christian,
there is and must be another Spirit then that which is in other men. Numb. 14.
24. He must be something more, and have something in him beyond what is in the
Hypocrite, or he cannot be saved, Mat. 5. 20. Except your righteousness exceed
that of the Scribes and Pharisees, you cannot enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven, Mat. 5. 47. What singular thing do ye? The differences then that we
find between the motion and operation of true grace in the true Christian, and
of counterfeit Grace in the Hypocrite are; Either in the Rise, Principle, or
spring of it, or in the proceed and end of it.

SECT. I.
In the Rise, Root, or Spring of true, and Counterfeit Grace in them.

The first of these is as the Root in relation to the Tree, or tree to the
fruit, or spring to the streams. We shall open it first in the Root or Spring,
and then in Fruit or Streams. The maine thing wherein the difference seems to
lie, is in something which is secret and invisible, which is called a hidden
life, Coll. 3. 3. The hidden man of the heart. 2 Pet. 3. 4. and that which is
within us. Luke 17. 20, 21. and the hidden Manna, a white stone, and therein a
new name written, which no man knows saving he that receives it, Rev. 2. 17.
and the Inward part, and hidden part, Psalm: 51. 6. And it is said to pass
knowledge and understanding, Phill 4 7. To be unspeakable, 1 Pet. 1. 8. And
they in whom it is, are called Gods Secret, or hidden ones, Psalm: 83. 3. The
foolish Virgins wanted nothing that the wise had in sight, but they wanted this
hidden wisdom, 1 Cor: 2. 7. The secret and inward work of Grace in their
hearts. This Secret and hidden work then lies in this, That the true Christian
(in order to the execution of Gods eternal decree for his Salvation) having a
new nature wonderfully formed in him by his spirit, is by faith (in a
Spiritual and Mystical way) to be united to Christ, as a body to the head,
and building to its foundation, and to have his Spirit dwelling in him: And the
Soul and the Body, is as one body, animated by Christ, as the Soul thereof;
so that Christ is said to live in him, dwell in him, and walk in him; And the
Christian to live by him. So that as we all in the state of corrupt nature,
partake of the nature of the first Adam, even so all that are saved, partake of
the divine nature of Christ the second Adam, 2 Pet. 1. 4. Gal: 2. 20. I am
crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in
me, and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the says of the
Son of God, Joh: 5. 26. 2 Cor: 13. 5. 2 Timothy: 2. 14. Romans 8. 10, 11. If Christ
be in you etc. But if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
you, he that raised up Christ from the dead, shall quicken your mortal bodies
by his spirit that dwells in you, Jo. 14. 16, 17. 1 Io: 5. 12. He that has
the Son has life, etc. And together with this union, arises our
Regeneration, or the new Creature, called the New man, Ephesians. 4. 24. which
after God is created in Righteousness and true Holiness: Compared to a new
engrafted Tree, that brings forth the fruits of Love, joy, Peace,
Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness and Temperance, Gal.
5. 22, 23. This great work in reference to the Fruits and effects of it, is
compared to, and set forth by several things, as (1.) By the Oil in the
vessel which the foolish Virgins wanted, Mat: 25. 1, 2, 3. etc. to note that
there must be something within to feed and maintain the life of grace and
holiness in a true Christian, which Christ by his Spirit does give forth to
every true believing Christian, that is a member of his mystical body, Io. 15,
1, 2, etc. Heb. 1. 9. Psalm: 133. 2. (2.) By the Root of a Tree, or Herb in
relation to the Tree or herb, Rev: 22. 16. I am the Root etc. Rom: 15. 12.
There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign. Romans 11. 17.
Job: 19. 28. To note that the true Christian has all his life and virtue from
Christ by his spirit, as the Tree has its life and virtue from the root of it,
Coll. 2. 6, 7. As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye
in him, rooted and built up in him etc. (3.) By the earth that feeds the Tree,
Mat. 13. 6. To note that Christ must feed the true Christian, or he will not be
fruitful. (4.) By the Tree in relation to the branches thereof, Io: 15. 1, 2,
3. etc. I am the true vine etc. Every branch in me, etc. To note that the
Christian has his rise, support, growth, and feeding from Christ. (5.) By the
strong foundation of a Building, in relation to the building, Ephesians: 2. 20. And
are built upon the foundation etc. Jesus Christ himself the chief corner stone
etc. In whom you also are builded together for an habitation by the spirit.
Coll. 2. 7. rooted and built up in him, 1 Cor. 3. 11. 1 Pe. 2. 4, 5. To note
that the true Christian, as a Christian has all his Rise and Support from
Christ. 6. By the engrafting of a Cion of a Sprig in a Tree, in relation to the
Stock, Romans 6. 5. To note that all the good that comes from him, is from
Christ, being incorporated into him. (7.) By a lively spring, in relation to
the streams thereof; Zach: 13. 1. Jo. 4. 14. and 7. 38, 39. To show that all
the operations of grace within us, issue from the spirit of Christ within us.
(8.) And by a new Birth, or Resurrection from death to life, in Relation to the
operations of Life, Jo. 3. 3. Ephesians. 2. 1. Jo. 5. 25. To note that all the
motions, Acts and works of grace in the true Christian, move from this new
life, Coll. 3. 3. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God, 2
Cor. 4 10. That the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal
flesh, etc. Now this union between Christ and the true Christian soul, and the
presence of Christ's Spirit in the soul, is not at all to be found in the case
of the Hypocrite, and that work that is wrought in his heart, for he has
neither the Spirit of God, nor Faith, Jude v. 19. Jo. 6. 64. There is no such
root of the matter in him, which we have spoken of, Job. 19. 28. But rather
there is still in him the root of Bitterness, Acts 8. 23. that will bear fruit
accordingly, and he stands by himself, and at a distance from Christ; He is
therefore a Lamp burning, that has no more to maintain it, but what is in it
self, and therefore cannot burn long; or as a Tree that has no Root, or as a
branch of a tree cut or broken off the tree, and put into the ground, or as the
Cions of a Tree grafted into another stock, that does not grow into, and up
with it kindly. These and such as these, will never bear fruit kindly, and
lastingly. So that then the Christian which is not in Christ by Faith, and in
whom Christ dwells not by his Spirit, cannot bear good fruit at all, much less
can he bear good fruit long, Ioh. 15. 1, 2. etc. As the branch cannot bear
fruit of it self, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide
in me. And as a stone not well put into the building, but hanging loose by it
will fall out, and the building that has a bad foundation will never stand
long; So will it be with the Hypocrite, Mat: 7. 24. Luke 8. 13. Rom: 8. 9, 10.

SECT. II.
In the exercise and proceed of true and counterfeit Grace in them.

If it be asked how this Indwelling of Christ by his Spirit in the soul, and
the union of the Christian thereby to Christ, may be known? We answer. That
this is not known so much by it self, as by some fruits and effects, as also
by some reflect acts of the soul upon these fruits, Io. 3. 2, 3, 8, 9.
Marvel not that I said unto thee, ye must be borne again. The wind blows
where it lists, and thou hear the sound thereof, but can not tell whence
it comes, and whither it goes. So is every one that is borne of the Spirit,
but it may be known by the fruits of it, Gal: 5. 20. The fruit of the Spirit is
Love, joy, Peace, Long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, mecknesse,
temperance, Romans 14. 17. The Kingdom of God is not etc. But Righteousness,
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. This is one thing that does ever accompany or
follow this work in the soul, that it makes a very great and a general change
therein, there is a new light and a new life in the soul; and this is
discovered by such like effects and works, as discover the life of the body,
such as are constant breathing, the use of the Spiritual senses, Hunger,
thirst, walking, talking, and the like The soul does long and breath after God
and Christ, and the things of God, it can hear, see, and relish divine things,
it does hunger and thirst after righteousness, and the means of grace, Gods
word, and the like, it can walk with some strength in Gods ways, talk of good
things: And this change is very great, so that of a Lion the man is made a
Lamb, Esaias 11. 6. Of darkness he is become light; Ephesians. 5. 8. Ye were sometimes
darkness but now are light in the Lord, Ephesians. 2. 1, 2. etc. You that were
dead has he quickened, etc. All things are become new in him, and therefore is
he said to be a new Creature, 2 Cor: 5. 17. If any man be in Christ he is a new
Creature, old things are past away, behold all things are become new. He has a
new Name, Rev. 3. 12. A new life, Psalm. 51. 10. He has a new Heart, a new
understanding, judgment, will and affections, new principles, new motions, new
qualities: his Heart of stone is become a heart of flesh, E zech. 36. 26. A new
heart will I give you, etc. Ezekiel: 11. 19, 20. And I will put a new Spirit
within you. And I will take the stony heart out of them, and give them a heart
of flesh, that they shall walk in my statutes. So that when by reflect acts of
Faith upon this Change wrought in him, and upon these fruits of the spirit, he
looks upon himself, he may now say with Paul, Gal. 2. 20. I am Crucified
with Christ. Nevertheless I live, yet not (...), but Christ in me, and the
life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the says of the Son of God,
who loved me and gave himself for me. Now he sees God as he is, and judges
of God and Christ, and the things of God and the world as they are, and finding
himself beloved of God and Christ, he loves them again, more then the world,
more then himself, he delights himself much in God, wills him as his last
end, and his chief good, and wills Gods will, and being now made partaker of
the divine nature. 2 Pe. 1. 4. and having Gods Image of Righteousness and
holiness reinstamped upon him, he has the same mind in him that is in Christ,
and he does walk in this World, as Christ walked in this world, his words,
works, and life are clean changed Ephesians. 4. 24. And that ye put on the new man,
which after God is created in Righteousness and true holiness. 1 Cor. 15. 49.
Coll. 3. 10. And instead of the Fruits of Adultery, Fornication, uncleanesse,
lasciviousness, wantonness, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
emulation, wrath, strife, sedition, Heresies, which are the works of the flesh,
Gal. 5. 24, 25. and were the fruits he brought forth before. Now his work is,
and the fruits he brings forth are, Love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, which are the fruits of
the Spirit; And by reflecting upon them he knows them. But these reflect acts
and operations of Christ's spirit, are not to be found in the heart of an
Hypocrite, his heart is still the same, or worse then ever it was, as full, or
more full of Pride, malice, coveteousnesse, and all manner of secret
wickedness, then ever it was, Mat. 23. 25, 27. within they are full of
Extortion and excess, and of all uncleanness, Acts 8. 23. thou art in the
gall of bitterness, etc. Psalm. 58. 2. In heart ye work wickedness. etc. Mat.
12. 34. Prove. 26. 24, 25, 26. And it must of necessity be so with him, for he
has no Faith, which does purify the heart. Acts 15. 9. 1 Jo. 3. 3. And hence
it is that the Hypocrite is still called upon to repent, and wash his heart,
Esaias 1. 10. Jer. 4. 14.

If it be objected that there is in the heart of an Hypocrite, some work of the
spirit, much like to the work that is wrought in the heart of the true
Christian?

To this we Answer. That there is some likeness between the common, and the
special work of the spirit, in the hearts of good and bad; And yet if these
workings be well observed, these differences may be found between them. (1.) In
the heart of the true Christian, as the heart it self is rooted in Christ, So
is grace by Christ's Spirit rooted in the heart, and springs from the spiritual
life that is within it, which is Christ who dwells in it, Ephesians. 3. 17. That
Christ may dwell in your hearts by Faith. Coll. 2. 7. Rooted and built up in
him. etc. Romans 6. 5. For if we have been planted together etc. But that which
is in the heart of an Hypocrite, is without root or foundation, the(...)e is no
spring within, to feed or maintain it, but it is as a plant ungrasted, or as
water in a poole or cisterne, Mat. 13. 21. Mat. 7. 26. The parables of the
several sorts of hearers, and of the house built on the sand.

2. True grace in the heart of a true Christian, does flow naturally from it,
as the water out of a spring, that will still issue forth, and as the
operations of life move in a living body, which cannot be stopped while the body
is alive, Acts 19. 20. We cannot but speak the things we have seen and heard,
Io. 7. 38. Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water, this he spoke of
the spirit, which they that believe on him should receive etc. 1 Io 3. 3. Acts
15. 9. Phill. 2. 20. Psalm. 119. 174. and 40. 8. and 39. 3. Pro. 10. 11. 1 Pe.
2. 2 But the motions and operations of that seeming grace which is in the heart
of an Hypocrite are forced, and come heavily, as water drawn up by a Pumpe,
bucket, or such like engine, and as the motions of seeming life, in a dead
body, made by art, after the fashion of men and beasts, which have been made to
act, and do like to living beasts and men. He is as a Cisterne that has no
water any longer then it is powered in it. Mat. 13. 21. Yet has he not root in
himself, but dureth for a while.

3. The true grace in the heart of a true Christian, is for the most part
quick, lively, active, and vigorous, as the spring water is, and the motions of
life in the living part of the body are, the more it does, the more it may move
and act, Heb. 6. 10. Your labor of love, Acts 15. 9. Purifying their hearts by
Faith, 1 Io. 3. 3. And every man that has this hope in him, purifyeth himself
etc. Jo. 7. 38, 39. 1 Pe. 1. 3. Unto a lively hope etc. But the common work of
the spirit in the Hypocrite is not so, but dull, dead, and ineffectuall. James
2. 20. Faith without works is dead. He is not so active within in his heart
toward God, as he is without in his tongue, but his heart acts another way,
for this does naturally in him work wickedness, Ps. 58. 2. Ezekiel. 33. 33. With
their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their
coveteousnesse. And he does no more in his heart, toward the things that are
good, then an Artificial leg or tooth, to the motions of life in the body,
Jam. 2. 17.

4. True grace out of the heart of a true Christian, does commonly flow out
abundantly, as the water out of a lively Spring, Jo. 7. 38, 39. Out of his
belly shall flow Rivers, etc. But that which is within the heart of an
Hypocrite is but little, and of another kind; That therefore that the Hypocrite
receives herein, is compared to a Taste, that which is as by a Gargarisme in
the mouth received in; but that the true Christian receives to eating and
drinking, or to the virtue and strength he gets: by strong a Cordial which
remains, Heb: 6. 4, 5.

5. The true grace in the heart of the true Christian is fixed, constant and
certain as the Root of a tree, and does establish him that has it, Heb. 13 9.
But that which appears in an Hypocrite, is fleeting, transient, and
incertaine, like to a thin vapor or Cloud, Jade v: 12. Clouds they are without
water, carried about with wind, Hosea 6. 4. Your goodness is as a morning
cloud, and as the early dew it goes away.

6. The true grace in the true Christian, is commonly increasing and growing as
the young tree, or child, Psalm. 84. 7. They go from strength to strength. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 3: Your faith grows exceedingly. Psalm. 1. 2. But otherwise it is in
that which is in the Hypocrite, because it lacks root, it does not grow but
wither away, Ma. 13. 6, 21. Because they had no root they withered away.

7. The true grace albeit it does grow, yet it does commonly grow leasurely and
by degrees, Heb 5. 12. Jer: 14, 9. Luke 24. 25. But that which is in the
Hypocrite, is soon up, and grows very fast, Mat: 13. 20, 21. And in him the
proverb is fulfilled, Soon ripe soon rotten.

8. True Grace in the true Christian, as it is pure in it self, so is it of a
purifying and cleansing nature, it works out sin and corruption out of the
heart. As the Spring the dirt that is within it, Acts 15. 9. Purifying their
hearts by faith, 1 Pe. 1. 22. Seeing ye have purified your souls, etc 1 Io. 3.
3. Io 7. 38, 39. But otherwise it is in the heart of the Hypoc(...)ite, which
is still as filthy as ever it was, Acts 8. 23 Thou art in the gall of
bitterness etc. Mat. 23: 25, 27. Within they are full of wickedness.

9. The true Grace in the heart of the true Christian is very powerful,
prevalent and victorious, as a lively Spring, or flood of water, that does
carry all before it, it will make its way through all difficulties, till it
has attained its end 1 Io. 5. 4. Whatsoever is borne of God overcomes the
World. To. 8. 35, 38, 39. What shall separate us etc Ephe. 1. 19. And what is
the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe etc. Cant: 8. 6,
7. Love is as strong as death. Romans 8. 37. We are more then conquerors etc. 1
Cor. 4 20. The kingdom of God is not in word but in power, 1 Thessalonians. 1. 5. But
the common work of the Spirit in the heart of an Hypocrite, has no such power
or prevalency in it, but it may be easily interrupted and abated by temptation
or opposition. Mat. 13. 6, 21. Job: 8. 13.

12. And lastly true Grace out of the heart of the true Christian, does issue
continually without end, as a lively Spring that is seldom or never dry, Io:
7. 38, 39. Psalm: 1. 3. But it is otherwise with the common work in the heart of
the Hypocrite, this like a standing poole in a dry Summer, does often fail
altogether; it is therefore said to be mortal and corruptible, 1 Pe. 1. 23.
And very often Hypocrites do discover themselves, by a total and final
Apostasy, Job. 8. 13. Mat. 13. 6, 21, 22. 1 Io. 2. 9. If yet you shall desire
to see more particularly, the differences that there are, between the true
Christian and the Hypocrite, we shall in the next place lay down some of them.

CHAP. VII.
The differences that are between the true Christian and Hypocrite in some
particulars.

AND now having hinted at the general differences that are between the
operations of true, and of counterfeit grace in the heart of a true, and false
Christian, we shall descend to some particulars, and speak to these heads. (1)
The difference that is between the outside, or the outward works of the true
Christian and the Hypocrite. (2.) We shall lay down the difference that is
herein in their inside, and in the operations of their hearts (to wit) the
differences between the real good, in the heart of the true Christian, and the
seeming good in the heart of the Hypocrite. (3.) We shall lay down some of the
differences that are between them both in their inside, and outside, (4.) We
shall lay down some marks or signs of Sincerity and Hypocrisy, setting the
one in opposition to the other, the which may serve to discover both. (5.) And
then lastly, we shall lay down some other characters and signs of Sincerity,
which are signs of other things, that do always accompany Sincerity.

SECT. I.
The difference between the true Christian and the Hypocrite in their Outside.

For the first. The difference that there is between the true and counterfeit
Christian, in their outside, or by their external works: we are to know, that
the Hypocrite (As we have said) may have as fair an Outside, as the best
Christian in the World; And some Hypocrites are such, and continue so to their
dying day; and can say with that young man, Mat. 19 17, 18, 19. All these
things have I kept from my youth up. And yet in most of them perhaps, if they
be narrowly watched, some halting may be found in this also, as to their
conversation. The true Christian is altogether a Christian, does follow Christ
fully in all things, and whether soever he goes, and allwaies. And he being
wrought upon so effectually by the word and spirit, as to be cast into the
mould, or transformed into the likeness thereof: he is for a present
compliance with the whole will of God in all things, he does walk in all the
commandments of God blameless; He escheweth all that is evil, and does all
that is good, Ephesians: 4. 28. Zach. 13. 4, 5 Isa. 1. 16, 17. He is for all duties
to God, and duties to man, he is for piety, justice, and sobriety. And he is
for Godliness not only in the form, but in the power thereof; he is for
greater, for lesser, for public for private duties; he is for duties that are
in esteem, and duties out of esteem, he is for more and for less profitable
duties and performances; for duties of mercy and charity, as well as for duties
that have outward profits and advantages attending them, and in them all he is
alike constant and industrious in their proper places. And as to all the will
of God, and duty and work thereby incumbent on man, he is universal and
uniforme amongst all persons, in all times, places, and cases, one and the
same, and changes not, but continues so to his dying day, Psalm: 18. 21, 23,
24. For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from
my God. I was also upright before him. And I kept my self from mine iniquity,
Luke 1. 6. It is said of Zachary and Elizabeth, they were both righteous
before God, walking in all the commandments of God blameless. Caleb, that he
did fully follow the Lord, in Deuteronomy. 1. 36. Numb. 14. 24. and 32. 11, 12. Of
Auna, Luke 2 37, She served God with fastings and Prayers night and day. Of
Cornelius Acts 10 2. He was a devout man and one that feared God with all his
house, which gave much alms unto the people, and prayed to God always Psalm.
101. 2. I will walk uprightly in the midst of my house, Acts 2. 43. And they
continued steafastly in the Apostles doctrine, Psalm: 101. 1, 2, 3 I will set no
wicked thing before mine eyes, Ephesians: 5 1. Mat: 8. 10. and 16. 24. Jo. 4. 24. 1 Samuel 12. 3, 4. 2 Cor. 7. 2. But the Hypocrite is but almost, or half a
Christian, does but some things and follow Christ in part. And he (as to this)
is commonly faulty in one of these particulars. 1. Either he will put off, and
delay to do what he is commanded. Luke 9 59. Suffer me first to go and bury
my Father, etc. 2 Or he will do it but by halves when he does it, Hosea 7. 8,
16. Numb. 32. 11. 3. Or he will do too much, more then is given him in command
by God, being led therein by his own fancy, or the commandments of men, or
some humane Tradition: and so it is a Will worship, Mat. 15. 2, 3, 6. etc. Why
do thy Diseiples transgress the Traditions of the Elders etc. But he answered
why do you also transgress the commandments of God by your Tradition. For
God commanded etc. In vain do you worship me teaching for Doctrines the
commandments of men. So Jehu, 2 Kings 15. 1, 2. etc. Luke 18. 10, 12. Psalm:
119. 81, 82. Hosea 5. 11. 4. Or else (and this is more common with him) he does
too little; he does less then God commands, and in the rest will do his own
will, Hosea 7. 7. 5. Or he is all for the duties of the first table, he is
toward God religious, but toward man unjust, cruel, unfaithful, etc. Esaias
1. 11, 12, 13. For what purpose are the multitude of your sacrifices, etc. your
hands are full of blood etc. Mal. 2. 6. Have been partial in the Law. Ezech:
22. 26. 6. Or he has somewhat of both, but he has a reserve, he must be borne
and dispensed with in some things, he has some beloved sin or other of
Profit and Pleasure, as Naaman, 2 Kings 5. 18. the Jews Exodus 16. 28, 29.
Saul, 1 Samuel: 15. 8. Herod, Morke 6. 20. and others. 7. Or he is very exact in
the lesser, but very careless in the greater things, Mat. 23. 23. Woe to you
Scribes, etc. Ye pay Tithe of Mint, Annis, and Cummin, but have omitted the
weighty matters of the Law, judgment, mercy, and Faith, etc. 8. Or he is all
for duties that are more public, and not at all for private. 9. Or he is for
duties that are in request, and of self advantage, and for none others, Acts
8. 21. There is scarce an Hypocrite to be found, but lives in some known sin
or other, and under the power of some lust which he serves. He will serve two
masters, Mat: 6. 24. He supposes the love of God and the world may stand toget
her, and that he may serve both, James 4. 4 The dog has his kennell, and the
Sow her swill. And if you mark well his stepps, you will find him in time of
Temptation drawn, or driven to the omitting of some good, or doing of some
foul evil. And to take the boldness, at least at some time, or in some
places, or amongst some company, or in some case to offend wickedly, Ezekiel. 33.
30, 31. compared with Ezekiel. 8. 7, 8, 9. 1 Samuel: 10. 10. and 14. 33, 34. Mark. 6
20, 21, 22, 27. 2 Kings 5. 18. Mat: 13. 22, 23. Job. 27. 10. Isa. 65. 3, 4, 5,
6, 7. Hos. 7. 7, 8, 9, 10. etc. Zeph: 1. 5. Job. 27. 10. Luke 17. 15. And
sometimes he takes offense, at some word or work of God, or by some other
occasion, and falls clean away by Apostasy. 1 Jo: 2, 19. 2 Timothy 4 10. 1 Samuel:
13. 8. 28. 7. Luke 18. 22. Mark. 6. 20. And thus much of the differences
between them in their outside.

SECT. II.
The Differences between the saving work of Gods Spirit in the true Christian,
and the common work in the Hypocrite.

We come now to the Second head, to speak of their Inside. And herein shall
observe the differences, that there are between the saving, and real Graces of
the true Christian, and the counterfeit Graces of the Hypocrite in some
particulars.

1. In their Knowledge.
The true Christian has, and must have the knowledge of God, for without this,
the heart cannot be good, Prove. 19. 2. And so the Hypocrite may have, and has
also. But there are these differences between the knowledge of the one, and the
knowledge of the other. 1. The knowledge of the true Christian is commonly a
more clerae, and distinct knowledge, Phill. 1. 9, 10. Mat: 13. 11. But that of
the Hypocrite a more general, confused, and obscure knowledge: and such was
the knowledge of the Scribes and Pharisees of the Scripture. 2. That of the
true Christian is more certain, as being grounded upon the Scripture, and also
upon some practice, and experience of the things known. And it is like to the
knowledge that a man has of meats, drinks, and medicines, by the view, taste,
and trial over and besides his reading of them. And to the knowledge that a man
has of a Country, that he has dwelt, walked in, and beheld with his own eyes,
over and above his knowledge thereof by the Map, Phill. 1. 9, 10. Heb: 5. 14.
Psalm: 34. 8. 1 Pet: 2. 3. But that of the Hypocrite is only speculative and
discoursive, like to the knowledge that a man has of a far Country by a
Map, or by reading of it; or to the knowledge that a man has of the virtues
of meats, and medicines, by the reading thereof only, Mat. 23. 16. 17. Jo: 3.
10. Acts 22. 3. Phill. 3. 4, 5, 6. 3. That of the true Christian, is always
accompanied with a desire and labor of increase thereof, and the more he has,
the more he desires and labors to have still, Phill. 1. 9, 10. Coll: 1. 10.
2 Pet: 3. 18. But in that which the Hypocrite has, it is otherwise, for he
being full, cares for no more thereof, nor does he desire it farther then it
will make to his advantage in his design he drives, Job. 21. 14. Rev. 3. 17,
18. 4. That of the true Christian is a Spiritualizing knowledge, it does
spirituallize the man, and his heart in whom it is, 2 Cor. 5. 16. 1 Cor: 2. 7,
14. Mat. 13. 11. But that of the Hypocrite, is carnal, earthly, natural, and
sensual, as the man in whom it is, is. And hence it is that he takes things,
yea the most spiritual things carnally, Io. 3. 4, 9. and 6. 41, 45, 52, 60,
63, 66. 2 Cor: 2. 14. and 4. 3. 5. That of the true Christian, is a lively
effectual, and working knowledge, that produces great and lasting effects, in
the heart and life of him in whom it is. It is like to fire, that does not only
give light, but heat, purify, consume, and otherwise work according to the
matter on which it comes, and wherewith it meets, and so it is: 1. A heart
affecting knowledge, For thereby and therewith, there is wrought and kindled in
the heart, dear affections toward the things known, God, Christ, Word,
Christians, and other known spiritualls, a high esteem of, a vehement love to,
delight in, an ardent and strong appetite, (as of the child after the mothers
breast) after the enjoyment of them, Psalm. 119. 72, 97, 103, 162. 1 Pe. 2. 3.
Phill: 3. 8. and 1. 9. 1 Cor. 2. 2. 1 Cor: 8. 1. 1 Io. 4. 7, 8. Cant. 6. 1. But
that of the Hypocrite is a remote knowledge, that does swim^^e in the brain
only, and does never come near to the heart, it is a cold, flat, and dead
knowledge, that either does not at all affect the heart with any life or hear,
or if it does, it is but slightly, and for a little time, and it is soon
quenched again, Ezech: 33. 31. Mat. 13. 11, 20. Mark. 4. 6. 2. It is a heart
purging knowledge, for hereby the heart is more and more purged from its sin,
and wrought and changed into an holy frame, after the likeness of the word, as
the wax to the Seal put upon it, 2 Cor. 3. 18, 1 Pet. 1. 22. Ye have purified
your souls in obeying the truth, etc. 1 Pe. 2. 3. Jam: 3. 17, 1 Io. 3. 6. But
it is not so in the heart of the Hypocrite, his heart is not changed at all, or
not changed thoroughly and to purpose, Heb. 4. 5, 6, and 11. 12, but he
continues therein as bad or worse then ever he was. Acts 8. 21. 22. Romans 1. 32
3. It is a heart humbling, and Souleabasing knowledge. It makes a Christian
vile and despicable in his own eyes, the more he sees of God, and Divine
Mysteries, the more humble, self empty, self denying, and self abhorring he
is. Job. 42. 5. 6. Romans 7. 18. 24. Gal. 2. 20. Phil. 3. 7. 8. 1 Cor. 15. 9:
Ephesians. 3. 8. 1 Timothy 1. 15. But that of the hypocrite does puff him up. So the
knowledge of the Pharisees puffed them up. Io. 9. 40. Are we blind also? 1 Cor.
8. 1. And this knowledge in Gods account is no knowledge at all 1. Cor. 8. 2.
4. It is a life-reforming knowledge and obedientiall and practical knowledge,
and makes him in whom it is fruitful in all good works. 1 Ioh. 2. 3. Hereby
we know that we know him if we keep his commandments. James 3. 17. the wisdom
that is from above is etc. full of good works 2 Cor. 3. 18. But we all with
open face beholding the glory of the Lord are changed unto the the same Image
1. Ioh. 4. 6. Joh. 13. 17. But that of the Hypocrite is but seldom so, and if
it do work upon him any change of reformation it is but in the outside only,
but generally he is a hearer and Talker but no Doer of the word. Mat. 23. 3.
they say and do not. v. 27. ye appear beautiful outward but within, etc. are
full of all uncleaner. 1. Jo. 2. 3. 4. 6 The knowledge of the true Christian is
a communicative knowledge, in order to the edification of others, wife,
children, servants, neighbors etc. It is still scattering and dispering it
self abroad. Prove. 15 7. His lips disperse knowledge. Psalm. 112. 9. He has
dispersed etc. Psalm. 51. 12. 13. But the Hypocrite, he either hides his Talent,
or if he do employ it, he does it to advance his own praise or to further his
own corrupt ends. Mat. 25. 25. I was afraid and hid my Talent etc. Mat. 23.
15. ye compass sea and land to make a proselite etc.

SECT. III.
2 In their zeal.

The Hipocrite may have and has (as we have shevved) a zeal, and this zeal
may be upon religious grounds, as is and must be the zeal of the true
Christian, and according to the dictates of his Conscience But we shall find a
vvidc difference between the zeal of the one and of the other, in these
things 1. The true Christians zeal is after knowledge received from the Word
of God, and it is for Christ and his truth, Isa. 8. 16. Rev. 3. 19. Tit. 2. 14.
Numb. 25. 11, 13 But the zeal of the Hypocrite is nofter the knowledge of Gods
Word, but after his own, or other men's opinions and inventions, Rom 10, 2. They
have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge, Mat. 15. 9 Gal. 4. 17, 18.
and against Christ, as that of Paul was at first, Phil. 3. 6, 9. 2. The true
Christians zeal is, and springs from the work of Gods Spirit, and his own faith
in Gods word, Jer: 20. 9. Acts 19 19, 20. But the Hypocrites zeal arises from
some humane Motive, Tradition, Custom, Education, or some such like thing
without, and the corruption of his own heart within, Act. 22. 3. I was zealous
toward God as ye all are this day. Mat. 15. 9. Teaching for doctrines the
co^mandments of men, Joh. 4. 20. 3. The true Christians zeal is accompanied
with a deep sense of his original and internal wickedness, which the Hypocrite
minds not, Luke 18. 10, 11, 12. The Publican went up to pray, etc. He stood
afar off, etc. 4. The true Christian being sensible of his own heart-emp^iness
of Grace, and the insufficiency of all things without Christ to fill it, sets a
low value upon all other things in comparison of Christ, and longs after, and
looks for all from Christ, Phil. 3. 8. Luke 1. 53. But the Hypocrite has with
his zeal, a heartfulness, and self-confidence of his own sufficiency, Luke 1.
53. Mat. 5. 6. Romans 10 2, 3. For they being ignorant of Gods righteousness, and
going about to establish their own righteousness, etc.

SECT. IV.
3 In their love to God. And the properties of true love to God.

The true Christian loves God, and so he must: for this is the whole duty of
man, Mat. 22. 37. And so perhaps the Hypocrite may do. But there is a wide
difference betwixt the one love and the other love: thus. The sincere love of
the true Christian is, 1 A rational and understanding love; it arises from the
knowledge of God, his excellencies, loveliness, goodness, beauty, and works,
and especially as he is revealed in Christ by the Gospel, Psalm. 63. 2, 3. O God
thou art my God, early will I seek thee, my sonl thirsts for thee, etc. to
see thy power and thy glory, etc. For thy loving kindness is better than life,
etc. Psalm. 9. 10. Heb 1. 3. Joh. 14 9. 2 It arises from Gods love, and the
sense thereof to him, and the apprehension he has, that God is a reconciled
Father to him, 1 John 4 10. We love him, because he first loved us, Joh. 3. 16.
Luke 7. 47: 2 These. 2. 16. 3 It is a natural love, as the love of a child to
the father, arising from his new nature, as he is born and brought forth a
child of God: And so he loves God as in the relation of a Father to him, Gal.
4. 6. And because ye are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into
your hearts, crying Abba Father, Romans 8. 15. 4. It is a pure love; he loves God
for his own sake, and for the good he sees to be in him, and for the good he
does to others, as well as for the good he does to him. And in this it is like
to the true love of a man to a woman, when he loves her only for her person and
qualities sake, and not for her portion, Psalm. 34 8. Cant. 1. 4, 15. Psalm. 63.
1, 2, 3. 5 It is an open and ingenuous love, it moves the heart toward God, as
the heart of one faithful friend to another, James 2 23. Ioh 3. 29. Ioh. 15.
14, 15. 1 Cor. 13. 4. 6 It is a strong, transcendent, and supernatural love.
And more, and greater than his love is to his Father, Mother, Brother, Sister,
Wife, Children, Self, or any thing else in the world: for he looks on God as
his chief good, and cannot be satisfied with any thing else in the world,
without him; can acqui^sce in, and be satisfied with him without all things
else; and for his sake he can, and will do, or suffer any thing; and for the
enjoyment of him, he can, and will part with his right eye, right hand, or any
thing else whatsoever, never so near, or dear to him; and in him is all his
delight, Mat. 10. 37. Heb. 11. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 35. Rev. 12. 11. Cant. 8 6,
7. Luke 18. 28. Psalm 63. 1. and 116. 7, and 8 4. 2. 5, 7. Psalm. 37. 25. Luke
14. 27. 7 It labors to improve it self by all advantages, and tha^ it may love
more, Psalm 116. 1. 8 It is a laborious and working love, Gal. 5. 6. 1 Thessalonians. 1.
3. 9 It is a true love that runs through the whole man inward and outward.

The Thoughts.
1 It will make them be all upon him, Ps. 113. 13. and 63. 6. ubi amor, ibi
oculus, ibi animus. 2 The Judgment, it will cause it to set a great value on
him, Lam. 3, 24. 3 The Desires, it will make them to go much after him, Isa.
26. 9. 4 It will make him content to wait for him, Isa. 26. 8, 9. Psalm. 40. 1.
5 It will make him to be patient under delay and suffering till he come, Psalm.
40. 1. 6 It will make the Will to close with him, hold him fast, and not to let
him go, Cant. 3. 4. Psalm. 18. 21. 7 It will make him rejoice in his presence,
and mourn for his absence, etc. Ps. ^2. 1. 11. 19. 8 It will make his tongue to
be still talking of him, Psalm. 119. 27. and 63. 3. and 145. 21. 9 It will make
his hands still ready to be working for him. 10 It will make the whole man to
be ready to do or suffer any thing for his sake, Psalm: 119. 168. And not be
satisfied, but mourn that he can do no more for him. 10 It is a lasting,
constant, unchangeable, and never dying love, Cant. 8. 6, 7. 11 It cannot be
quenched; and it does manifest it self by these, and such like signs and
effects.

1 By the hatred of evil, Psalm. 97. 10. Ye that love the Lord hate evil.

2 By the love of the godly, 1 Ioh. 5. 1. Every one that loves him that begat,
loves him that is begotten of him, 1 Pet. 1. 8. 1 John 3. 13, 14.

3 By pitying of; and yielding help to them in time of misery, 1 Ioh. 3. 17.

4. By care to keep the Commandments of God, Ioh. 14. 23. 1 Ioh. 2. 3, 5.

5 By a desire after fellowship and communion with God in Christ, Psalm. 42. 2.

6 By a tenderness and respect of Gods glory manifested and declared, 1 By a
man's own personal obedience to God, Ioh. 15. 8. Mat. 5. 16. 2 By his stirring
up of others to obedience to him, Ps. 67. 1, 2, 3, 3 By his affection to Gods
cause, and interest in the world, which when hindered he grieveth, Ps: 119. 136.
when prospering he rejoices, Ps. 97. 1. and 122. 1. 4 And by his adventure of
himself in it, Mat. 26. 58, 69. 11 It makes him that has it to desire and
labor to be like to God, Psalm. 17. 15. 12 It is communicative and open, it
makes him that loves open handed, and ready to communicate himself, and all
that he has to, and for God and his service, 2 Cor. 9. 11. Pro. 7. 9. 13. It
will make a man do all that he can for, and nothing against God, Prove. 31. 12.
14 And it will make him in whom it is to suffer any thing for Gods sake, Genesis
30. 20. But the false love of the Hypocrite (if he can love God at all) arises
from some false persuasion that he may have of Gods love to him, in this that
he does him no hurt but good, because he does prosper in the world, is healthy,
great, and rich, and the like; or because he may have a fancy that the promise
of the Gospel; and Christ does belong to him; or he may have a little kind of
seeming love to God for his self ends, and for some present use or need he
has of him, as Soul did love David; or he may live in hope, that God will, or
may do him good, or do him no hurt, for some such causes, or upon, and by some
such motives as these, somewhat like to love, or some little weak and corrupt
love may be in an Hypocrite; but really he is a lover of himself, and loves the
world more than God, 2 Timothy 3. 2, 4. He is a lover of his belly, Phil. 3. 19.
Mat. 19. 21, 22. He loves evil more than good, Psalm. 52. 3, 4. Or he loves
God and the world both together, Mat. 6. 24. I^^^es 4. 4. He seeks the praise
and favor of men more than the praise and favor of God. He does not love God
more than Father, Mother, Wife, etc. Mat. 10. 37. He does not delight himself
in the Almighty, Job 27. 10.

Ob. But here it may be said out of Romans ^. 30. and 8. 7. John 15. 19. That the
Hypocrite being still in his natural estate is a hater of God.

Ans. It is true the Hypocrite being still in his natural estate, is a hater of
God in his heart, and that which is of love, or the appearance thereof therein
is but forced, and against his nature; and is a kind of restraint of suspension
of hatred; so a Lion tamed may be brought to seem to like, and to converse with
the Lamb, but retains his nature still, and upon the first occasion will show
it; or (at the best) it is but a politic, artificial, or carnal and corrupt
love, from self respects, and to self ends, as a man that loves a woman for her
portion only, and not for her person or parts.

SECT. V.
4 In their love of Christ. The properties of this love.

The true Christian loves Christ: And so he must; for without this he cannot be
a true Christian, 1 Cor. 16. 22. 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2. And the Hypocrite may have a
kind of love to Christ also, Mat. 19 16. But herein also we shall find a wide
difference between them

1 The true Christian he ha thnot only a good will to Christ, Ioh: 3. 26. to
30. Ioh. 3. from 1 to 11. but a longing desire after him, Cant. 1. 2. Rev 22.
17, 20. And satisfaction in him, Cant. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2 The love of the true Christian to Christ, is like to his love to the father;
and so does manifest it self as the love of the child of God does manifest it
self to God. As,

1 It arises from the knowledge of Christ by the preaching of the Gospel, and
that discovery he has thereby of Christ's beauty, glory, excellency, and
necessity, in reference to his soul, Psalm. 45. 2. etc. Cant. 2. 3. and 5 10. 6.
1 John 6. 6. 68. Lord to whom shall we go, thou have the words of eternal
life? And from his faith in him. John 69. And we believe and are sure that thou
art the Christ, the Son of the living God, 1 Pet. 1 8. whom having not seen, ye
love, etc. Yet believing, etc. And from the good which he has experimentally
got by him, Cant. 1. 3. 4. 15. and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. and 5. 10. Luke 7. 38, etc.
Psalm. 45 6: 11. 15 Isa. 33. 17 and 45. 22.

3 It arises from Christ's love, and the sense thereof to him, Ephesians. 5. 2.
Rev. 1. 5. to him that loved us, and washed us in his blood.

4 It is pure also; for he loves Christ as well for himself, and the loveliness
he sees to be in him, his odoriserous smell, and for his sweet taste, as for the
need he has of him, and the benefit he may have by him, Cant. 1. 3, 4, 15.
Ioh. 7. 7. and 21. 16. 17.

5 It is a strong and transcendent love that is in the soul of the true
Christian to Christ; it will part from all rather than part from him, Cant. 8.
6, 7. It is as strong as death, the coals thereof are coals of fire, which have
a most vehement flame: Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods
drown it, Luke 18. 28 and 14. 26, etc. 10. 37, 38. Rev. 12. 11. Acts 21. 13.

6 It is a laborious love, Heb. 10. 6. James 1. 4.

7 It is a constant, lasting, and unchangeable love, Cant. 8. 6, 7. it cannot
be quenched.

8 And it is a love that is like to the love of a dear Wife to her loving
Husband, or the love of a contracted Virgin, betrothed to her lover a young
man, where the love is exceeding strong, and does manifest it self by such like
effects as these.

1 By a high esteem of his love, and all the manifestations thereof by tokens,
letters, kisses, etc. Cant. 1. 2. and 7. 10.

2 She looks upon all that ever he is, and does as lovely, Cant. 1. 4, 6. and
2. 1. and 5. 10.

3 She does highly esteem all that is about him, and does concern him. So has
every true Christian an high esteem of Christ's love, and the manifestations of
it: thinks well of all he is, and does, loves all his ordinances and graces,
Cant. 2. 3. and 5. 10.

4 She thinks much of him in his absence.

5 She has an earnest desire after a fuller assurance and evidence of his
love, and the full and perfect enjoyment of him, that as man and wife they may
for ever dwell together, and never be sundred any more. And so the Christian
has after Christ; and therefore the true Christian soul does long for his
appearing, and the consummation of all things, Cant. 2. 4. 8. 6. and 7. 12. And
till this may be attained, and for the present he has a desire of union with
him; an earnest desire after, and delight and rejoicing in the manifestations
of his presence by his Spirit within, and amongst his people, and in his
ordinances without, as the wife has, in as near an approach to, and
intercourse with her Husband as she may, Cant. 1. 2. and 2. 4. and 8. 14. and
4. 16. and 7. 11, 12. Is. 26. 2. Jer. 22. 24. In order to this,

1 The Spouse of Christ does always entreat him, and woo him for his company,
Cant. 2. 7, 8, 9.

2 She does enquire after him, where she may meet with him, and they may have
conference together, Cant. 1. 7.

3 She makes her way through all difficulties to come to him, Cant. 5. 7, 8, 9.
and 8. 7.

4 She when she has gotten him, labors by all means to keep him with her, and
not to let him go. And for this,

1 She is glad, and takes hold of all opportunities whereby she may manifest
her love to him, Cant. 7. 12.

2 She labors in every thing to please him, give him all the content she may,
and every way to seem as lovely to him as she may, and is very careful not to
grieve him, Cant. 2. 12. and 8. 2, 3. And therefore,

1 She is mighty careful to keep his commandments (as a wife to keep the
charge of her husband) in head, heart tongue, and life, John 14. 15. 21. 23.
and 15. 10, 14.

2 She will suffer any thing from him, as his rebukes, etc. John 21. 15, 16,
17, or for him, 1 Cor. 13. 4.

3 She will part with any thing to him, or for his sake, Luke 13. 28. 1 Cor. 1.
4.

4 She loves all his friends, and does manifest it by doing all she can for
them, especially for their souls, and is extremely glad with their prosperity,
and sad in their adversity, 1 Pet. 1. 8. 1 John. 3. 13, 14. John 21. 15, 16.

3 And she is extremely troubled when he is gone, especially if she find he
has received any discontent, and she will not be quiet till they be friends,
and he come again, Cant. 3. 1, 5, 6: and 6. 2.

But the love of Christ that is in the heart of the Hypocrite, it is not such a
love; it is not so rooted and grounded in Christ, or in the heart, and
therefore fades and dies in times of persecution; nor does it arise from the
love of Christ to him, and the view of Christ's loveliness, nor is it a pure
love for Christ's sake but from the love of himself; nor are there such effects
as we have observed to be in the heart and life of the true Christian, but the
contrary thereof are found to be in him: For this pretended love toward Christ,
such as it is, is only, or especially for some outward advantage that he that
loves has, or hops to have by Christ, as Saul loved David for the ease he
gave him by his Music, 1 Samuel 16. 21. And so many of them that followed
Christ, and had some love to him, that they did herein was doubtless for their
outward advantage only, and therefore upon the least occasion of dislike, they
took offen^e at something in his work or words, when they saw it to be more for
their outward advantage to leave him they fell off from him. Luke 9. 57. A
certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whither soever thou go.
And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, etc. but the Son of man has no
where to lay his head. Mark 10 17, 18. 19, etc. There came one running, and
kneeled to him, saying: Good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal
life, etc. And he said, Go sell that thou have, etc. and thou shall have
treasure in heaven, etc. and follow me. And he was said at that saying, and
went away grieved; for he had great possessions. The stony ground hearers, Mat.
13. 21. when tribulation or persecution arises because of the Word, by and by
he is offended. Joh. 6. 26. Ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles, but
because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. Labor not for the meat
which perishes, etc. Joh. 6. 66. From that time many of his Disciples went
back, and walked no more with him.

SECT. VI.
5 In their love of the Saints. The properties thereof.

The true Christian does love the godly, and those that are true Christians;
and so he must do, or he cannot be a true Christian, Joh. 13. 35. By this
shall all men know ye are my disciples if ye love one another, 1 John 2 9, 10,
11. and 3. 14, 15. And so we have said, that there is, and may be in an
Hypocrite a kind of love to the godly also, but with these differences.

1 The sincere love of the true Christian arises from Gods love in him, 1 John
5. 1, 2. Every one that loves him that begat, loves him that is begotten of
him.

2 It is a pure love: For,

1 It is from the heart, that is pure being purified by Faith, 1 Timothy 1. 5. 1
Pet. 1. 22.

2 Because God commands it, 1 John 4 21.

3 He loves all the Saints, Phil. 1. 1. Col. 1. 3, 4.

4 It is for Gods sake, as the child that does love for the Fathers sake,
because he believes them to be Saints, beloved of God, and because he sees
the true Image of God upon them, which is beautiful in his eye, and the more
thereof he sees upon them, the more he loves them. And because there is a
likeness and relation between them, and him, as children of the same Father;
there is a Brotherhood between them, and they are follow members of one body, 1
John 5. 2, 3, and 4. 21. and 5. 1, 2. Mat. 10. 12. 1 Pet. 2. 17. 1 Cor. 12. 12,
25, 26.

3 It is an unfeigned love, moved, and carried out for the good of him that is
beloved, 1 Pet 1. 22. Unto unfeigned love of the brethren, etc. Heb. 6. 10. 1
John 3. 17. 18. Rom: 12. 9.

4 It is a kindly affectioned love, Romans 12. 10. like the dear love between
Father and Children.

5 It is a courteous love, it makes him courteous toward him that is beloved
of him, 1 Pet. 3. 8. Love as brethren, etc. be courteous.

6 It is a servent love, 1 Pet 1. 22. See that ye love one another out of a
pure heart servently, 1 John 3. 16.

7 It is a real love, 1 John 3. 16, 17, 18. We ought to lay down our lives,
etc. But whose has this worlds good, and sees his Brother have need, and
shuteth up his bowels of compassion etc. Let us not love in word, etc. but in
deed and in truth.

8 It is uniting to the person beloved, 1 Pet. 3. 8. Be of one mind, etc. Love
as brethren.

9 It is a transcendent supernatural love, 1 John 3. 16. And we ought to lay
down our lives for the brethren, John 13. 35. James 2. 15, 16.

10 It is a lasting and continuing love, 1 Cor. 13. 8. Charity never saileth,
etc. Heb 13. 1. Let Brotherly love continue. And this love does yet further
appear by such like effects and operations as these which follow.

1 It desires to be united to the person beloved, and to have as much of his
company as it can, Psalm. 119. 63. I am companion of them that fear thee. etc.
and 16. 3. But to the Saints, etc. in whom is all my delight.

2 It turns into mercy when the person beloved is in misery, 1 John 3. 17.
Whosoever has this worlds good, and sees his brother has need, and shuts up
his compassion. etc. How dwells the love, etc. 1 Pet. 3 8. Love as brethren,
be pitiful, etc. Heb. 9. 10. James 2. 15 16

But for the further opening of the properties of this love, see 1 Cor. 13 4,
5, 6. 7. Charity suffers long (i.) it will suffer much and long for the sake
of him it loves, what cause soever is given, and it makes a man of a patient
spirit. And is kind (i.) It is open hearted, and this makes it open handed'
ready to distribute, tender and compassionate, and ready to do any kindness to
others that it can do; it is easy to be made use of, and ready to communicate
itself, and what it has to do any good offices it can do for tothers; it is
as tender of others as it is of its own good; it rejoices at the good, and not
at the hurt of another, and it spends itself, and is spent for the good of
others. It envieth not (i.) It is very well pleased at, and contented with the
happiness of others, and does not grudge it. It vaunteth not it self, is not
puffed up (i.) It keeps the man from vain ostentation, insolency, and
scornful thoughts against, and ill demeanor toward others. Does not behave it
self unseemly (i.) It will not disgrace another, nor suffer him that has it to
use unseemly words or gesture toward another. Seeks not her own (i.) It is
communicative, and cannot content it self to do good to it self, but it must
be doing good to others also. It is not easily provoked (i.) It will dissemble
injuries, and swallow down wrongs; it is slow to wrath, and not quickly angry,
what cause soever be given. And when it is angry, it is not extremely, and
irreconcilably angry. Thinks not evil (i.) As it does not speak or act, so
it does not imagine mischief against others. Rejoices not in inquity but in
the truth (i.) It takes no pleasure in doing, or speaking evil; it is glad to
see the good, and sad to see evil in others; or it is glad when it sees others
falsely accused to be cleared; or it takes part with good men, and good things
Bears all things (i.) It helps to bear others burdens, their weakness and
wants, by contribution to their help. Believes all things (i.) It is not
lightly credulous, nor easily suspicious; but it is candid and ingenuous; it
believes all the good it hears, or can have any ground in charity to believe;
it will cover as much as it can the faults of others, and therefore does
charitably interpret the words and deeds of others. It will make the most of
the good, and the least of the evil another says or does, and is apt to
construe all things in the best sense; and as far as may be it will conceal the
evils of others for their good. Hops all things (i.) It hops the best where
there is no apparent reason to the contrary. It hops all the good it can
hope, and that which cannot be well beloved. And it does never so far despair,
as not to use means. Endures all things (i.) It will bear the greatest, rather
than do the least injury: it will bear all things it may bear with a good
conscience: it will suffer much evil it self, to do a little good to others.

But otherwise it is in this particular also in the heart of an Hypocrite: For
either he does hate, envy, or contemn the true Christian (and this is most
common) 2 Chronicles. 18. 7. Or else he does dissemble love, 1 John 3. 17, 18. Or if
there be any love in him toward them, it is but toward some of them; or he
loves the wicked as much as them; or he loves the godly coldly, or but a little
while; or he loves them only out of respect to himself, and for self ends, and
to serve his own turn by them, because they are, or may be of use to him; or
(at the best) because they are harmless men, or men of fine parts, or because
the time favors them, or they are beloved of most men, or for some such like
cause. Nor is there such evidence and demonstration of his love, as there is of
the love of the true Christian; for he commonly is proud, scornful,
censorious, harsh, hasty, and the like Isa. 66. 5. Your brethren that hated
you, etc. Joh. 15. 18, 24, 25. They have both hated me and my father etc. Psalm.
39. 19. Them that hate me without a cause. Luke 19. 14. Isa. 1. 13. 1 Pet. 1.
22, 23. Ps. 41. 6. compared with Ps 35. 16. With hypocritical mockers in
feasts, etc.

SECT. VII.
6 In their love of the Word of God.

The true Christian does love the Word of God, Psalm. 119. 13. And so he must.
But the Hypocrite has a kind of love to the Word also The differences lie in
these things.

1 The true love of the true Christian arises from his love to God and Christ,
whose Word it is, and from the excellency of it, as having his likeness upon
it, Psalm. 119. 129. Thy testimonies are wonderful, therefore does my soul keep
them, Psalm. 19. 7, 8.

2 It is a natural love, arising from the new creature within him, as he is a
new born child of God, and has a new life, whence arises hunger and thirst
to this Word, the proper food appointed of God to feed it, and maintain the life
thereof, 1 Pet. 2. 2. As new born babes desire the sincere Milk of the Word,
etc.

3 It is a pure love, he loves it for it self, and for the purity and
perfection of it, Romans 7. 12. 22. Psalm. 19. 7. The Law of God is perfect, etc.

4 It is a vehement love, as that of a child to the mothers breast; he has an
high esteem of the Word, a strong desire after it, cannot live without it, no
more than the child without the breast, and will not part with it for the
whole world, 2 Pet 2. 2. Psalm. 119. 97. 20. 72. O how I love thy Law, etc. My
soul breaks for the longing, etc.

5 It is an universal, and impartial love, it is to all the Word, and that
part most of all that shall detect and correct his most secret sin, Psalm. 141.
5. Romans 7. 12, 13, 14.

6 It is a fruitful, changing, and efficacious love: it makes the man in whom
it is by the use of this Word to grow still, and be changed into the very
likeness of it; and so to love the knowledge of it, as to fall into the
practice, and obedience of it. He loves to do it, as well as to know it, 2 Cor.
3. 18. But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,
are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of
the Lord, 1 Pet. 2. 2. As new born babes desire the sincere milk of the Word,
that ye may grow thereby, Romans 6. 17. But ye have obeyed from the heart that
form of doctrine. Job 23. 12. Neither have I gone back from the commandment of
his lips, etc. 1 Pet. 1. 22. But the false love, and so the short and slight
delight of the Hypocrite to and in this Word, has none of all this; for it is
commonly to a part of it only; he cannot brook that part thereof that shall
discover and correct his sin, especially his secret and beloved sin, John 3.
20, 21. Mark 6. 17, 18. 3 Luke 19 20. 2 Chronicles. 18. 7. And that love he has to
the rest does usually arise from the excellencies or noveltie of the matter
treated of therein, the singular gifts of the Preacher, or some view he has of
the sweet promises of the Gospel contained therein, the Redemption by Jesus
Christ, and the happiness of such as believe in him, and that he by mistake
does apprehend he has a share therein: But it works no change at all in him,
nor is he at all conformed thereunto in his heart and life. He does hear, but
not do it: he casts it behind his back, and commonly he hates it, Ezekiel.
33. 31, 32, 33. Isa. 58. 2. and 59. 2. Ps. 50. 16, 17. Romans 2. 13, 23. James 1.
22. Jer. 7. 23, 24.

SECT. VIII.
7 In their love to Ordinances.

The true Christian does love and delight in all the rest, the Ordinances of
God, the Sabbo^h, Sacrament, Prayer, and the like. And some kind of love and
delight there may be also in the heart of an Hypocrite, but with a great deal
of difference. The love of the sincere Christian to them is as they are pure
Ordinances from God, and are by divine institution, and serve to his glory, and
the good of souls, and as they serve to bring God and us near together, and to
maintain our communion with him: And it is his meat and drink to use them, Romans
7. 22. Heb. 8. 10. His Laws are put into their mind, and written in their
hearts. Romans 7. 22. He does delight in the Law of God after the inward man. And
together with his use of them he does join Reformation of heart and life, Psalm.
119. 14 I have rejoiced in the ways of thy Testimonies, Psalm. 119. 10, I have
refrained my feet from every evil way, Ps. 40. 8. But that which is in the
heart of an Hypocrite of delight and pleasure in them, is very little and
short. And that is only for his self ends at the most, because he conceives
there is a necessity of the doing of them in order to salvation: And so an
Hypocrite may like of, and use them as a bridge to go over to heaven, or as
men use Physic. But commonly he does account all these things as a burden,
and he does use them as a cloak to his wickedness, Isa. 58. 2, 3, 4, etc. Isa.
59. 2, 3, etc. Ezech. 33 32. Amos 8. 5. When will the New Moon be gone, etc.
the Sabbath, etc? And he does continue still in his wickedness (at the least of
the heart) as before. Psalm. 58. 2, 3 Yea in heart ye work wickedness, etc. Mat.
23. 27. Acts 8 22, 23.

SECT. IX.
8 In their love to, and desire after Grace.

The true Christian does, and must love and desire Grace. And the Hypocrite
also, as he has a kind of love to Gods Word, and to godly men: so has he a
kind, or appearance of desire, and love to Grace. But there is a great deal of
difference between them: For, 1 The love and desire of the true Ch^istian is a
true and natural love, arising from his new nature, and Gods Spirit in him: The
love of Grace is Grace, and a part of the new creature. 2 His love to it is for
it self, and its loveliness in his eye, and the likeness it has to God, and
the agreement that there is between the true Christians changed nature and it,
and because it makes him like to God. But that which is in the Hypocrite is
counterfeit, and not from a new nature: for he is not regenerate, neither has
he the Spirit of God in him. But that seeming love and desire of Grace which is
in him is only for himself, and his own end; and so he may have a confused
desire of it, as apprehending it may be a means to escape the wrath of God, and
the condemnation of hell, and to obtain heaven and happiness for him. 3 The
true Christians desire after Grace is vehement, active, and unsatiable, Psalm.
84. 2. 7. Cant. 4. 16. He cannot be satisfied with any measure of it, but
hungers and thirsts still for more, Ps. 119. 97. O how I love thy Law, etc. My
soul breake^h for the longing, etc. Phil. 3. 12. Romans 7. 24. Luke 1. 53. Mat 5
6. Isa. 55. 1, 2. But the love that is in the Hypocrite is a weak, cold,
careless, and unactive love, he thinks he has enough, and cares for no more,
Rev. 3. 17. Because thou say I am rich, etc. Luke 6 25. and 1. 53. Luke 18.
12. But more of this afterward in the fifteenth Section.

SECT. X.
9 In their faith and trust in God.

The true Christian does believe, and trust in God, John 14. 1. Psalm. 31. 1.
And so he must do, 2 Chronicles. 20. 20. Psalm. 130. 7. The Hypocrite also has a
kind of trust and hope in God, Psalm. 106. 12. Job 8. 14. But there is a great
deal of odds between the faith, trust and hope of the one and of the other.

1 The faith and hope of the true Christian is grounded upon the Word of God,
and the Promise and Covenant of God in Christ, which he does well understand,
and wherein he hopes himself to be included, Psalm. 78. 7, 8. Psalm. 119. 42. 94.
I am thine save me, Psalm. 9. 10. They that know thy Name will put their trust
in thee, etc. But the Hypocrite does commonly trust in himself, or somewhat
else besides God. Luke 18. 11. 21. Romans 10. 3. That which the Hypocrite has,
is often times wrought by something else besides the Word of God, Psalm. 106. 12,
13. John 2. 23. and 6. 2. and 4. 48. And that kind of trust he has in God is a
groundless trust, it has no root, Micah 3. 11. Luke 8. 13.

2 The true faith, and trust of the true Christian brings forth obedience, and
submission to all Gods will in doing and suffering, Hab. 2. 4. The just shall
live by his faith. Isa. 25. 9. Psalm. 40. 1. But the faith and hope of the
Hypocrite is fruitless to himself and others, Job 8 14. The hope of the
Hypocrite shall fail him, and be as the spiders webb, Ps. 106. 6, 7, 13.

3 It is a continuing and a growing trust, but the faith and trust of the
Hypocrite is a temporary and vanishing faith and trust, Psalm. 106. 12, 13. Then
believed they his words, etc. they soon forgot his works, etc. Exodus 14. 31.
Mat. 13. 6, 20, 21. Ps. 78. 34, 35.

SECT. XI.
10 In their Faith in Christ. Signs of it.

The true Christian is such a one as does believe in Christ, and so he must,
John 14. 1. But the Hypocrite (as we have showed) may believe in Christ also,
John 2. 23, 24, 25. Luke 8 13. But there is a vast difference between the faith
of the true, and the faith of the false Christian herein.

1 The one, the unfeigned faith of the true Christian is a grace of the
Regenerating Spirit, and always accompanied with Regeneration, John 1. 12, 13.
But as many as received him, to them he gave power to be the Sons of God, even
to them which believe in his Name, which was born not of blood, etc. Ephesians. 2. 8.
Gal. 5. 22. John 3. 5.

2 The faith of the true Christian is grounded upon the promise, and is always
accompanied with the knowledge of the promise of the Gospel it does believe,
Ephesians. 1. 13, 14. In whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth
the Gospel, etc. Isa. 53. 11. By his knowledge shall my righteous servant
justify many, etc. John 17. 3. It is life eternal to know thee, etc. 1 John 5.
10, 11. Romans 10. 14.

3 He takes, accepts, and receives Christ for salvation, and that upon his own
terms, Luke 9. 23. If any man will come after me let him deny himself, John 1.
12. Acts 6. 31.

4 It is a faith whereby a man takes Christ to him, and gives himself up to
Christ, Heb. 11. 13. Having seen the promises afar off, etc. and embraced them,
etc. Phil. 3. 12. John 5. 24. and 6. 37, 38. Romans 12. 1.

5 It is a soul melting faith, Zach. 12. 10. They shall look on him whom they
have pierced, and they shall mourn, etc.

6 It is a soul-purifying faith, Acts 15. 9 Purifying their hearts by faith,
etc. and 26. 18. Which work it does, 1 By application of the Word against sin,
John 17. 17. 2 By application of Christ's blood, Zach. 13. 1. 3 By an inward
efficacy and operation, so it is a part of sanctification, Gal. 5. 22.

7 It is a soul-conflicting Faith, it has many doubts, fears, and difficulties
to encounter with, Mark 9. 24. And stratway the father of the child cried out,
and said with tears, Lord I believe, help thou mine unbelief. Phil. 2. 12. Work
out your own salvation.

8 It is an obedient-making faith: it makes a man sincerely obedient, Heb 11.
7. 8. 17. and fruitful in good works, Gal 5. 6. But faith which works by
love. Tit. 3. 8. Heb. 11 throughout. James 2. 17, 20. and ready and cheerful
therein, Gal. 5. 7

9 It is a soul-supporting faith in time of trouble, Hab. 2. 4. But the just
shall live by his faith. Job 13. 15, 16. and 19. 26. 27.

10 It is a prevalent and a conquering faith; it makes a man able to do the
hardest things, to break through all difficulties, overcome all temptations,
part with his dearest interests, trample under his feet all the threats,
pleasures, profits, and honors of the world, and makes a man hang loose from
them, James 4. 7. 1 Per, 5. 9. Heb. 11. By faith Noah, etc. prepared an Ark,
etc. ver. 24. 25. By faith Moses when he came to years refused, etc. choosing
rather, etc. 2 These. 1. 11. 1 These. 1. 3. Acts 17. 32, 34.

11 It is a quickening, powerful, lively, and a laborious faith, 1 These. 1. 3.
Remembering without ceasing your work of Faith, etc. Romans 1. 17. Gal. 2. 20.
James 2. 18.

12 It is very apprehensive of unbelief, Mark 9, 24. Luke 17. 5. And the
Apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.

13 It has with it a spirit of Prayer, Romans 10. 14. Psalm 116. 10.

14 It has with it some peace, Romans 5. 1. Being justified by faith we have
peace with God.

15 It is a growing and increasing faith. 2 Cor. 10. 15. Romans 1. 17. 2 These. 1.
3. Your faith grows exceedingly.

But the faith of the Hypocrite is a groundless faith, that for which he has
no promise; it is either Historical only, as was that of Agrippa, Acts 26. 27.
and of the devils, James 2. 19. that he does believe the things written in the
Word to be true. The devils believe and tremble. Or that of miracles, which
Judas and others had, by which they did miraculous and wonderful things, Mat.
27. 22, 23. Or an imaginary, fearless, and confident faith, a mere fancy, and
dream of the brain, whereby a man does conceive his estate to be good, and in
Christ, and yet is still in his carnal estate without any fruits of faith,
James 2. 14, 17, 20, 26. And this indeed is presumption. Or it is a temporary
faith, which does usually vanish like a Comet in time of trial, and he that
has it falls away by Apostasy, Luke 8. 13. with Mat. 13. 20, 21. Mark 10. 17.
And is not accompanied with the purification of the heart, or reformation of
the life, or any such lively effects as we have before observed to be in the
faith of the true believer, but it is like the corn, either withered by the
Sun, or choked by the thorns, Luke 8. 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14. Acts 8. 21, 22.

SECT. XII.
11 In their Repentance.

The true Christian must be convinced of his sin, inwardly grieved and humbled
for his sin, and this before and after his calling and conversion, and must be
changed and converted in heart and life from it, Luke 13. 3. Acts 17. 30. Acts
11. 18. Isa. 1. 11. to 29. Tit. 1. 15. Psalm. 66. 18. We find also that there
is a kind of grief and sorrow, and that there are gripings and affrightings in
the heart, and some effects thereof in the life of the Hypocrite, Mat. 27. 3.
Psalm. 68. 35, 36. But there is between the one and the other a great difference.

1 In the first conversion and repentance for sin in general.

And 2 in particular conversions upon particular falls.

As to the first: That of the true Christian is wrought by the Word of God
with the operation of the Spirit, discovering to him his sin and danger
thereby, Acts 2. 37, 38. Jer. 31. 19. After that I was instructed, I smote upon
my thigh. But the repentance of the Hypocrite may arise out of the working of
his natural conscience, and the fear of eternal vengeance, which he may have so
much faith to believe will light upon sinners.

2 In the ordinary way of Gods working on the heart in true Repentance: He
first of all convinces of the sinfulness and danger of sin, and then wounds the
heart, as John 16. 18, 19. Acts 26. 18. Ezekiel. 36. 31. Hosea 2. 6, 7. Acts 2.
37. Luke 15. 17, 18, 19. And by this, as by a preparative, makes way for
repentance and conversion, and a coming to Christ; so Acts 2. 37, 38. where
Peter advises the Jews then pricked in their hearts to repent, compared with
Mat. 11. 28. and Mat. 9. 13. And so being in Christ, there is a true turning to
God, Hosea 7. 16. and 2. 5. and 3. 5. But the conviction and sorrow of the
Hypocrite is without any turning to Christ, as Judas, Mat. 27. 3 or to God in
Christ; either he goes to the devil, 1 Samuel 8. 28. or wicked men, with Judas,
Mat: 7. 2, 4. or to the creature, or from one sin to another; he returns not
to the Lord; his returning is therefore compared to a cake half baked, Hosea 7.
8, 14, 15, 16.

3 The sorrow of the true Christian is a deep and thorough sorrow, Zach. 12.
10, 11, 12. And they shall mourn as one for his only son, etc. Mat. 26. 75. He
wept bitterly, Ier. 31. 18, 19. Ezekiel. 33. 10. But that of the Hypocrite is a
sudden flash, or slight qualm of grief only, Ps. 78. 36. 1 Kings 21 29.

4 The sorrow of the true Christian is a durable sorrow, it lasts as long as
his sin lasts, Ps. 51. 3. and 42. 5. Romans 7 24 2 Cor. 7. 10. But that which
is in the heart of the Hypocrite is a short and transient sorrow, like to the
fit of an Ague or Sea sickness, Hosea 7. 14. They have not cried to me with
their hearts.

5 The sorrow of the true Christian is for all sin alike, Ps. 51. 5. 14. But
that of the Hypocrite is commonly for some special sin that has (as he
supposes) brought, or may bring some special evil upon him; so Judas, Mat. 27.
3, 4.

6 The sorrow of the true Christian is a godly sorrow, Zach. 12. 10. 2 Cor. 7.
8, 9, 10. But the sorrow of the Hypocrite a worldly sorrow. That of the true
Christian it is a godly sorrow: For 1 it is joined with a holy shame, confusion
of face, and self abhorring, Ezekiel. 36. 31. Then shall ye remember your own evil
ways, etc. and shall loath your selves, etc. Ezekiel. 33. 10. Isa. 26. 11. 2 It
has more respect to the sin than to the punishment, 2 Samuel 24. 10, 17. I have
sinned, etc. But these sheep what have they done, let thy hand be on me, etc. 3
It is heightened with the thought of this, that it has broken the Law of God,
which it* does know to be holy, just, and good, Romans 7. 12. 22. 4 There is in
it a grief and displeasure a rising from hence, especially that thereby he
has offended a gracious Father, and showed himself unkind to a gracious
Redeemer; it is as the mourning of a Son over an offended Father, Zach. 12. 10.
I will pour out my spirit, etc. and they shall mourn for him as one would mourn
for his only son, etc. Psalm. 51. 4. 5 It has with it the hatred of the sin,
Romans 7. 15, 16. For what I would that do I not, etc. but what I hate, that do
I, etc. O wretched man that I am, etc. 6 It has also in or with it the fear of
God offended by its sin, Acts 9. 6. And he trembling and astonished said, Lord,
what will thou have me to do? 2 Cor. 7. 11. 7. There is with it, or in it, a
resolution never so to offend God again, Psalm. 17. 3. I am purposed that my
month shall not transgress. 8 It is always accompanied with a change of heart
and life, Ez^k. 18. 31. He is changed in his heart, To. 8. 2. From a carnal to
a spiritual estate, from darkness to light, Acts 26. 18. Ephesians. 5. 8. From a death
in sin to a life in grace, Ephesians. 2. 1: Luke 15. 32 From wickednlss to holiness;
from being under the power of Satan into the kingdom of Christ, Acts 26. 18.
Rom 6. 17, 18. and 10. 13: The conversation of this man is also changed: for he
is wrought from a sinful to a gracious course of life, and does conform
himself to, and comply with the whole will of God in all things, Acts 9. 6.
Lord what will thou have me to do? Mat. 18. 3. Isa. 55. 7. And much of this we
have together in that place, Jer. 31. 18, 19. I have surely heard Ephraim
bemoaning himself (thus) thou have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a
bullock unaccustomed (to the yoke) turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for
thou art the Lord my God. Surely after that I was lu^ned, I repented, and after
that I was instructed I s^o^e upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea even
confounded, because I did bear the rrpeoach of my youth. But the sorrow of the
Hypocrite that is for and about his sin, is a worldly and carnal sorrow: It is
either because he cannot sin so much, or prosper so well in his sin as he
would, or because of some evil of punishment within, or without, feared or
felt. It may be he is under the sense of the guilt of his sin, the fear of the
wrath of God, and the suffering of eternal vengeance for it, and so under the
anguish of a tormenting and unquiet conscience: And he takes more care to be
rid of this than of his sin, and more troubled with this than with the sin. And
so he may mourn for his sin, and resolve upon some kind of reformation for
fear that his sin otherwise may be his ruin. And this is as the grief of the
slave for fear of the whip. Genesis 4 13, 14. My punishment is greater than I can
bear, etc. Exodus 8. 28 and chap. 10. 16, 17. Forgive I pray thee my sin, etc.
and entreat the Lord to take away this death. And in his case there is no
Reformation accompanying or following of it: for he is (at the least in his
heart) worse and not better afterward, Mat. 12 43, 45. and 23. 27. Prove. 27.
25. So Ahab 1 Kings 21. 27, 29. See thou how Ahab humbles himself before
me, etc. And Saul, 1 Samuel 15. 24, 30. I have sinned, yet honor me amongst the
people, etc. And Judas, Mat 27. 7. I have sinned betraying innocent blood, etc.
Numb. 14. 39, 40, 41, 44. compared with Deuteronomy. 21. 41, 42, 43. they mourned,
etc. for we have sinned, etc. and yet notwithstanding they did presently
transgress the commandment of God, and rebelled against him, Isa 58. 6, 7, 8.
Genesis 4. 13, 14.

2 Much after the same manner is the repentance and sorrow of the Saints upon
their particular falls into gross sins, Psalm. 51. 1. And for their daily
weaknesses and frailties there is a daily and continual repentance and mourning
for it, Rom, 7. 24.

SECT. XIII.
12 In their Humility:

The true Christian must be, and is of an humble and lowly frame of spirit; and
has low and mean thoughts of himself, and of his own works and worth, and has
an humble confidence in the free Grace of God in Christ only for all the good
he looks for here and hereafter, Mat. 18. 8. Psalm. 131 1. Genesis 32. 10. The
Hypocrite we grant has a kind of humility also, Col. 2. 18, 23. The difference
between them lies in this.

1 The true Christian being truly humble does declare it by his whole
conversation in word and deed, Psalm. 131. 2. Neither do I exercise my self in
great matters, or in things too high for me. The Hypocrites humility is showed
only in some particulars, and in other things he shows himself very proud,
Mat 23. 5, 6. The true Christian does prefer other men and their gifts before
himself and his own gifts, and has an honorable esteem of all such as are of
worth, but suspecteth himself. 1 Timothy 1. 15. Christ Jesus came into the world
to save sinners, of whom I am the chief, Luke 18. 13. But the Hypocrite having
high thoughts of himself, and his works and worth, ^tusts to himself, and
despises others better than himself, Luke 18. 11. The Phaiisee stood up and
prayed thus with himself: God I thank thee that I am not as other men are.
Extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this Publican, Hab. 2. 4. Behold
his soul that is lifted up is not upright in him, etc.

SECT. XIV.
13 In their joy and delight in God.

The true Christian does, may, and must rejoice and delight in God and Christ,
and in the things of God, 1 Chronicles. 29. 9. 17. Psalm. 119. 47. But the Hypocrite
has also some delight and joy in God, and in his Word, etc. But there is a
great difference between this affection in the one, and in the other.

1 The true Christian does rejoice and delight in God and Christ, and the
matters of God for themselves, and the goodness and holiness thereof. Psalm. 27.
1, 2, etc. Psalm. 63. 1, 2, etc. and 84. 2, 3, etc. Romans 7. 22. But the
Hypocrite does not delight in God at all, Job 27. 10. Will he delight himself
in the Almighty? Or if his delight be in the Word of God, it is for some good
it seems to hold forth, or that he apprehends in it to himself.

2 The delight and sweetness that is wrought in the heart of the true Christian
arises from an inward principle, or new nature that is within him, which was
formed by the power of the Spirit of Christ, Ps 110. 3. But there is none of
this in the Hypocrite; for he is without the Spirit of Christ, Jude 19. and he
was never changed by it.

3 The joy and delight of the true Christian is a deep, large, and transcendent
joy, Ps 119. 14. 72. Phil. 4 7. It passes all understanding. Ps. 71. 23. Psalm.
4 7. But the joy of the Hypocrite is but a shallow, slight, and superficial
joy, compared to the taste of a thing, Heb. 6. 10. He has much more joy and
delight in his just, as Judas in his covetousness, and Herod in his Herodias,
than in God, and the things of God, Psalm. 4. 8.

4 The joy of a true Christian is a clear and pure joy, and there is no sorrow
in it, Prove. 10. 22, But the joy of the Hypocrite is an obscure and mixed joy,
Prove. 14. 13. Even in laughter their heart is sorrowful, etc.

5 It is in the upright accompanied with godly sorrow that goes before, or
with it, Psalm. 2. 11. Acts 2. 37, 38. But all the joy that is in the heart of
the temporary is without this, as in Herod, Mark 6. 20. Ezekiel. 33. 32. Mat. 13.
20.

6 The joy of the upright man grows up by grees and leisurely, Acts 2 37. 38,
46. Isa. 64. 5. But the Hypocrites joy is up and very high upon a sudden, Mat.
13 20.

7 The joy of a sincere man is a lasting and permanent joy, Isa. 35. 10. Psalm.
35 10. But the joy of the Hypocrite is but for a moment, it is soon up and soon
down, Job 20. 5. Mat. 13. 20, 21. Psalm. 106. 12. 13. Then believed they his
words, they sang his praise, they soon forgot his works. etc.

8 There is strength in the joy of the sincere man, Neh 8. 10. For it will help
him to bear his cross, Romans 5. 1, 2. Psalm. 119 92. Phil. 4. 7. But otherwise it
is of the Hypocrites joy, for when tribulation comes, he falls off, and has no
strength to bear it, Mat 13. 21. Luke 8. 31.

9 It will make him that is sincere more careful and active for God whiles he
is on his feet, and when he falls it will help to recover him, Luke 1. 74, 78,
79. Acts 9. 18, 19, 20. Psalm. 119. 32, 93. Psalm. 77. 6.

SECT. XV.
14 In their desires.

The true Christian has, and must have good desires, motions, and dispositions
to good, Ps. 37. 4. Isa. 26. 8, 9. 2 Cor. 7. 11. The Hypocrite also has
somewhat like to this, Numb. 23. 10. Joh. 6. 34. Luke 14. 15. But there is a
great difference.

1 Those desires of the sincere Christian are eager and earnest, 1 Cor. 14. 1.
Psalm. 42. 1. As the Heart pants, etc. Cant. 2. 5. I am sick of love. Psalm.
143. 7 and 119. 20. Mat: 5. 4, 6. But these of the Hypocrite are weak and faint
desires, that can away with delay and denial, Numb. 23. 10. John 5. 34, 35, 36.

2 The desires of the upright are laborious and diligent desires, that make a
man industrious in the use of all means to attain them, as in the bodily
hunger, which will break through stone walls, as that in Paul, Phil. 3. 8, 9. I
count all things but loss, etc. and dung to win Christ, verse 13, 14. I press
toward the mark, etc. and David, Ps. 119 20, 40, etc. But these of the
Hypocrite are sloggish, and he is notwithstanding them lazy, like to the
sluggard, Prove. 21. 22. 26, and 13. 5. So those John 6. 34, 35. So Balaam,
Numb. 23. 10. desired to die the death, but would not take the pains to live
the life of the righteous.

3 The true desires are constant and restless desires, Psalm. 119. 20. My soul
breaks for, etc. at all times, Psalm. 84. 2. My soul longs, etc. But these
of the Hypocrite are unconstant and sickle desires, James 1. 7, 8. a double
minded man is unstable, etc. and he is like a deceitful bow, Hosea 6. 16.

SECT. XVI.
15 In their fear of God.

The true Christian must fear God, 1 Pet. 3 14, 15. Jer 5. 22. Mat. 10. 8. And
he does so Nehemiah 7. 2. Mal. 3. 16. But there is also a kind of fear of God
in the heart of the Hypocrite. But the differences are many and great between
the one and the other.

1 The fear that is in the heart of the true Christian is a Sonne-like fear,
and joined with love; and he does fear the Lord as well for his goodness and
mercy, as for his judgments, Hos. 3. 5. They shall fear the Lord and his
goodness. But the fear of the Hypocrite is as the fear of a slave, or a servan
toward the master, or as a prisoner to the Judge. And he fears the Lord for
his judgments only, Isa. ^3. 14. Fearfulness has surprised the Hypocrites
who among us shall dwell, etc.

2 In the measure or degree. The fear of God in the true Christian is a
transcendent fear, he fears God above all, Heb. 11. 22, 23. Mat. 10 26, 28.
Genesis 39. 9. But the Hypocrite fears man more than God, Mat. 21. 26, 27.

3 The fear of God in the true Christian causes him to depart from all that is
evil, and to do all that is good, Prove. 8. 13. and 16. 16. But the fear of the
Hypocrite makes him rather to forbear the doing of good, and to adventure upon
the doing of evil, Mat. 25. 24, 25.

4 It is a lasting fear, but that of the Hypocrite only temporary and soon
gone, Exodus 14. 31. and 15. 23, 24.

SECT. XVII.
16 In the frame of their heart, in what they do or suffer.

The true Christian does, and must reform his life. And the Hypocrite seems
to do so; for the evil spirit seems to be cast out of him also, Mat. 12. 45.
But there is a great deal of odds in the frame and disposition of their hearts
therein, both in the first undertaking, and in their further acting, and that
in the leaving or omission of evil, and in the doing of good, and their motives
and ends therein: The true Christian in his first undertaking of the profession
of Religion, does design and aim at an universal and complete obedience and
conformity to the whole will of God, to keep all his Commandments, Ps. 101. 1,
2 3, etc. 119. 6. When I have respect to all thy Commandments. Heb. 13. 18. We
trust we have a good conscience in all things, willing to live honestly. Acts
24. 16. But the design of the Hypocrite is to go so far and do so much therein
as may serve to his own end, which is not to please and glorify God, but to
please and advance himself. And hence it is that it does sometimes forbear to
do the good he ought to do, and sometimes forbear to do the evil he ought not
to do, sometimes do the good he ought to do, Mat. 14. 5. Mark 12. 12. Luke
20. 19. and 22. 2. Joh. 9. 22. And in his further acting in what he does, and
in what he forbeareth to do. All that the Hypocrite does think of in the
forbearance of, or flying from evil, is to forbear it for his own end therein.
But the true Christian therein is moved from the fear of God, Genesis 39. 9. Prove.
14. 1. and the hatred of sin, Ier. 4. 4. And all that he does think of in doing
of good, is the work to be done, as in Prayer, only to pray, etc. But the true
Christian is careful of the manner and order of his doing, of the disposition
of his heart, and his aim and ends therein. That in it he be carried out from
the conscience of the command of God, and his obedience thereunto; his love to
God, 2 Cor. 5 14. That he be swayed more therein by the fear of God than the
fear of men, and with desire to please God rather than to please men, and that
he take more care to fulfill the will of God than of men, Gal. 1. 10 Nor do I
seek to please men, etc. Psalm. 119. 24. That what he does be done by the rule
of Gods Word, Luke 18. 20, 21. That he do it with his whole heart, willingly
and cheerfully, Psalm. 110. 3. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy
power. As for example with this acknowledgement of sin, there is joined a heart
broken for sin, hating it, resolving against it, and faith in the blood of
Christ, 2 Samuel 24. 10. Psalm. 51. 4. Luke 18. 10. Dan. 7. 7, 8, 9. Ezra 10. 2.
Mark 1. 15. And he has an end beyond himself, and the saving of his soul. To
please God, to do it to the Lord, for Gods sake, as well for his own sake, for
the advancement and glory of the name of God and Christ, as well as for the
good of his own soul, Phil. 1. 21. For me to live is Christ (that is) Christ is
both the author and end of my life: I live for him, I live in him, I live by
him, I live to him, or all the gain that I aim at in life or death is to
glorify him, Acts 20. 24. and 21. 13. I am ready to dye for the name of the
Lord Jesus, Mat. 6. 9, 13. Romans 9. 3. Lam. 2. 18. But otherwise it is in the
heart of the Hypocrite in all that he does of good, and forbeareth to do of
evil. It is for his own end. He leaves his sin, but loves it still. He has not
left it for love of God, possibly he may leave it for some fear of God and his
Judgments, or fear of men, as Magistrates, Ministers, Parents, and the like,
and fear of some harm that may come to him by them; for he has a slavish
fear, Genesis 28. 8. Mat. 14. 5. but be is the same man, and has the same mind
still as he had, Prove. 1. 22, 28, 29. He loves simplicity. etc. So he may
confess sin without any heart broken for or broken from sin, without any hatred
of sin, or purpose to leave it, or faith in Christ at all, as Judas, Saul, and
Cain did, 1 Samuel 15 24, 25. Mat. 27. 2, 3 Genesis 4. 4, etc. Deuteronomy. 1, 41. Prove.
28. 13. And he leaves evil and does good from the love to himself, and for
his self-satisfaction, and that he may do himself good thereby, either for his
own ease, or for his own glory and applause, or some other advantage that he
has, or hops to have thereby to accrue to himself; for he is mercenary, John
6. 26. Ye seek me not because, etc. but because ye eat of the loaves, and were
filled. He may make again by godliness; and so for self. ends, and out of self
love does seek himself, and serve his own ends altogether whiles he pretends
to seek God, out of love to him, and to serve the Lord Jesus Christ. Romans 16.
18. Serve not our Lord but their own belly Phil. 3, 19. whose God is their
belly, 2 Timothy 3. 4, 5. Lovers of their own selves, etc. Lovers of pleasure more
than lovers of God: Having a form of Godliness, etc. Romans 1. 25. Served the
creature more than the creator, etc. That do all for reward, Jude 11. Mic. 3.
11. 2 Pet. 2. 3. through covetousness shall with feigned words make
merchandise of the souls of men, Acts 20. 30. And so he may forbear to do the
evil that otherwise he would do, and do the good that otherwise he would not
do. So the Scribes and Pharisees did fast and pray to get praise and wealth,
Mat. 6 2. 16. Mat. 23, 14, 15. Zach. 7. 5. Did ye fast unto me, even to me,
etc. Hosea 7. 14, 15. And they have not cried unto me with their heart; they
assemble themselves for corn and wine, etc. and 10. 1. He brings forth fruir
to himself. Sometimes the fear of man keeps him from the doing of evil, Mat.
14. 5. and 21. 46. Sometimes this also may provoke him to some good, Genesis 28.
8. And as there is a great deal of difference in their minds as to their
doings, so there is as to their sufferings also for Christ. The true Christian
must suffer for Christ, and must be ready, and will be able to leave all for
him. The Hyocrite also may, and sometimes does suffer many things for Christ.
But the one of them has first learned to deny himself before he take up his
cross; the other takes up his cross before that he has learned to deny
himself. The one does suffer out of love to Christ for Righteousness and the
Gospels sake, for the glory of Christ, and advantage of Christians; The other
out of a self-love, for his own sake, as for his own glory and praise, or for
some earthly advantage to himself. So Judas suffered with the rest for Christ,
to fill his purse, and to be great in Christ's kingdom, which he thought would
be an earthly kingdom, 1 Cor. 13. 3. And though I give my body to be burned,
and have not charity, it profits me nothing. Psalm. 44. 22. 2 Timothy 2 10. Mark
10. 28, 29. Gal. 3. 4. Jerem. 15. 15. Mat. 10. 39. and 16. 25.

And thus much for the differences between them in their outside and inside
considered asunder. It remains now that we lay down some few differences that
there are between them in their outside and inside considered together.

SECT. XVIII.
17 In their falling into, continuance in, and getting out of sin.

The Hypocrite is naturally a sinner, and so is the true Christian, There is no
man good, no not one, Romans 3. 10. And they both sin; for there is no man lives
and sins not. 1 Kings 8. 46. And in many things we offend all, James 3. 2.
And if we say we have no sin we make him a liar, etc. we deceive our selves,
and the truth is not in us, 1 John 1. 8, 10. Psalm. 19. 12. Who can understand
his errors? Psalm. 38. 4. and 40. 12. and 65. 3. and 130. 3. But more
particularly.

1 The true Christian has in him originally the same pravitie and corruption
of nature that the Hypocrite has, and by nature they are both alike sinful,
Ephesians. 2. 1, 2, 3.

2 The true Christian has after his conversion somewhat of the corruption of
his nature still remaining in him. And therefore there is still in him some
propensitie and inclination to all sin, and a possibility of his falling into
any sin but the sin against the Holy Ghost; there is still flesh and spirit in
him, Romans 7. 15, 16, 17. Gal. 5. 17, 18. James 1. 13, 14.

3 He may be somewhat tainted and touched with any of the sins of the time and
place, as were the true Christians and members of the best Churches in all
times more or less, which is to be perceived by the Epistles of the Apostles
written to them.

4 This corruption may sometimes in the heart boil up and break out to some
height in the inward motions and lusts thereof, as in uncleanness, impatiencie,
pride, and the like; as in David, 2 Samuel 11. 2, 3. in Asa. 2 Chr. 14. 1, 2
compared with 16. 1, 2, 3. 7. 10. Jonah 4. 1, 2, 3. and others.

5 For the lesser sins of Infirmity, these he may commit daily all his life
long, Romans 7. 15.

6 He may occasionally fall into foul and scandalous sins, Murder, Adultery,
Drunkenness, and the like, as Noah, Peter, David, Lot, and others did, 2 Samuel
11. 2, 3, etc. Genesis 9. 24. Genesis 19. 32, 33. But for this see more in chap. 8.
at the beginning of it.

7 There may be very much of the will going along with his commitment of these
sins for the present time, as in David's case, Ps. 19. 13.

8 These acts of sin may by him be repeated again and again, Genesis 19. 33. 34,
35.

9 He may after his commission thereof rest and continue secure therein for a
while without repentance, as David did, 2 Samuel 11. 12.

In all these things there is little or no difference to be found in outward
appearance between the true Christian, and the Hypocrite, but that for a time
they may be alike. And yet there is an vast, an real difference to be found
between the Hypocrite and the true Christian herein also as to their committing
of, and continuance in their sin; and that before the sin done; 2 In the
commission of the sin; 3 After the sin committed: For he that is born of God
cannot, may not so sin as the Hypocrite can and may do, 1 John 5. 18. Deuteronomy. 32.
5. Their spot is not the spot of his children, etc. And there are to be found
these differences between the sin of the one and of the other.

1 Before the sin committed the sincere Christian does generally hate all sin,
for the evil that is in it, as well as for the evil consequences of it: And he
hates it in all men, more in those that are near about him, most of all in
himself, 2 Chronicles. 15. 16. Ps 101 1, 2, 3. He looks upon sin as a filthiness,
and flies it; he has a resolution against it, yea he cannot love or delight in
it; there being as great a contrariety between him and it, as between light
and darkness. And it is against his new nature, as it is contrary to the nature
of a sheep to wallow in the dirt. although happily this hatred in the very act
of the commission of the sin may be suspended, he is like a neat huswife in a
kitchen, that does keep her not only from the fire, hut from the filth and
soil of the place. He does not seek sin, Psalm. 119. 128. I hate every false
way. Romans 7. 15. But what I hate that I do. Psalm. 119. 57. I have said I will
keep thy words. Psalm. 19. 12, 13, 14. Cleanse me, etc. keep hack thy servant,
etc. Psalm. 97. 10. Prove. 8: 13. But the Hypocrite does not hate sin; for if he
did, he would hate all as well as some sin. But he does naturally love and
delight in sin, and in his own sin, which comes from a natural principle
thereof within him, Job 20. 12, 13. Though wihkedness be sweet in his mouth,
etc. Yea he loves the sin he has left, and dares not to commit it for some
inconveniences only that may follow upon it to him, Psalm. 36. 4. He abhors
not evii. Hosea 127. He is a Merchart, etc. he love^h to oppress. Psalm. 52. 3.
Thou love evil more than good. He is resolved to continue in his sin, unless
he see it be for his earthly advantage to leave it, and therefore does he plead
so much for it, and labor so much as he does to continue it, and does continue
in it. Psalm. 36. 4. He sets himself in a way that is not good. Psalm. 2. 3.
It suteth well with his corrupt nature and impure heart. It is with him therefore
as with a sluttish Cook-maid, who does not care to keep her self from the soil
and filth, but from the fire of the kitchen. So if the Hypocrite can keep
himself from the fire of hell, he cares not to be kept from the filth of sin.
He has (and this is the best of his case) some desire to be clean and cleansed
of sin, as it is necessary to save him from the fire of hell, and carry him to
heaven, and no further. And for these things see 1 Samuel 21. 7. Romans 1. 32. 2
Pet. 2. 15. 22. Psalm 50 16, 17. They hate to be reformed. 2 He does watch and
pray against it, Psalm. 9. 12, 13. Mat. 6. 13. Job 31. 1, 2. But so does not the
Hypocrite, but rather watch an opportunity to commit it, being that which he
desires, delights, and purposes to do, Mark 6. 21, 2 In the sin committed.
1 It is against the main bent, purpose, and resolution of the heart of a true
Christian to sin; for his firm purpose is to follow God fully, and to do his
whole will, and he does strengthen himself here^n. He does not contrive and
forecast to sin, but when he does so, he is (for the most part) surprised
therein. Psalm. 119. 33, 117, 106. I have sworn and will perform it, that I will
keep thy righteous Judgments, Psalm. 17. 3. I am purposed that my mouth shall
not transgresr. James 3. 2. Job 31. 1, 2. I made a covrnant, etc. Psalm. 101. 2.
Acts 11 23 Deuteronomy. 4. 4. Heb. 13. 18. Gal. 6. 1. To. 7. 16. ^9. Heb. 10. 26. And
therefore is he apt to hearken to any counsel that may prevent his sin. 1 Samuel 25. 32, 33. But the Hypocrite his purpose is to sin, he does forecast, and
devise mischief. Psalm. 52. 2. Prove. 6. 14. He keeps a Method in his sin, his
plot is to sin, but to sin so secretly as it may not be known. His sin is
premeditated, and (as we say) in cool blood: he watches his time for it; and
that he does herein is with the full consent of his will. Isa. 5. 18. They draw
iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as with cartropes, Psalm. 50. 19. thou
give thy mouth to evil. Psalm. 7 12, 13. and 36. 3. He sets himself in a way,
etc. So the Pharisees, Judas, J^hu, and others. They yield themselves as
servants to the service of sin, Romans 6. 16. and sell themselves, as Ahab, to do
wickedly 1 King. 21. 25. 2 The true Christian does very rarely fall into gross
sin; but some Hypocrites so commonly, that they make it, as it were their
trade, to do wickedly, and by a customary acting of it, have gotten such a
customary habit thereof, that they cannot leave, Jer. 9. 5. They have taught
their tongue to speak lies, and wearted themselves to commit iniquity. Jer.
13. 23. Can the Ethiopian change his skin, etc. then may ye also do good that
are accustomed to do evil. But the true Christian does for the most part keep
himself unspotted from the sins of the times; he does as the traveller, albeit
he meet with dirt in his way, yet does he as much as much as he may keep from
the offense of it; so the true Christian as much as he can keeps himself from
being solved by the sins of the time and place, 2 Pet. 2. 7. 3 The true
Christian does not sin so universally as the Hypocrite does. The true Christian
does not act sin with all the faculties and powers of his soul and body as the
Hypocrite does, but there is some reluctance in the heart therein. There is in
him flesh and spirit, a regenerate and an unregenerate part, Romans 7. 18, 22. I
delight in the Law of God in the inward man, etc. that which I do I allow not,
etc. the evil I have that do I, Gal. 5. 17. Psalm. 32. 2. Nor does the true
Christian, or he is not ready to commit all sorts of sin, and at all times and
always as the Hypocrite is, who makes it his trade to sin. Psalm. 50. 19. Thou
give thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frames deceit, thou sit and
speak, etc. And therefore he labors to be as skilful in it as he can, Jer.
9. 5. They have taught their tongues to speak lies. And he gives up himself
wholly to it, and to act all kind of sin, as a man of a trade does give
himself up to his trade, to do all that belongs to it, and to do it always.
Now he that is born of God cannot thus sin. Joh. 3. 9. It is not his ordinary
practice so to sin; but if happily he fall into a sin, he does not often; his
sin is occasional, like to the true man's going out of the highway, who comes in
again presently, and like a river that is turned out of its channel by some
stop or diversion, which will get in again as soon as it can. He does not go in
the way of Gods commandments as the Hypocrite does; for he like as the thief
comes in the true man's way, for the present to serve his turn, and to do
mischief only; else he keeps by-waies and obscure places. Nor does the true
Christian give and yield up himself to the service of sin, as a servant to
his masters work, Romans 6. 16. but as a prisoner is carried away from it against
his will, he yields himself for the present, as being unable to prevent it,
Romans 7. 23, 24. But I see another law in my members, bringing me into
eaptivitie, etc. Nor does the true Christian, or can he fall totally and
finally, Mat. 24. 24. deceive if possibly the very elect, as the Hypocrite may
do, and oftentimes does. The true Christian is like to the good tree, that
does ordinarily bring forth good fruit, which yet happily may by some accidents
fail some years; or he is as a man of healthy constitution that falls once,
or more than once into a fit of sickness, but otherwise is healthy always. But
the Hypocrite he is iike to one that has one of his noble parts, his liver or
his lungs corrupted and rotten, he is alwaias, and all over sick. And sin in
the sincere Christian is in some of these respects fitly compared by some to
the dirt in a lively pure spring, that will not suffer it to be quiet, but
will be working it out. But it is in the Hypocrite as in the standing pool that
gathers the mud, and keeps in when it has it; or as it is in a bad stomach
that loves, devoureth, and feeds upon trash, and retains it to the
destruction of the body, but a good stomach will not endure it, but cast it out
one way or other; or if it continue till it corrupt the body, it pusheth out
the corruption by boyls and the like; so the good soul cannot, will not endure
sin long within it in peace. 4 After the sin committed, i. The true Christian
having sinned does not rest secure in his sin, he does not allow or approve of
what he has done, much less does he justify or defend, leest of all does he
glory in it, as the Hypocrite does: but finding himself to be polluted and
wounded by it, he labors with all speed to be cleansed and cured. He is
therefore displeased with himself, and grieved for it, repents of it, is
afraid of Gods displeasure by it, as a child of the displeasure of a father
when he has done a fault; and therefore he is glad of any help herein for his
cure: For the sin of the true Christian to him, is as the cruel service of the
Israelites under their cruel Taskmasters in Egypt was to them. Romans 7. 24. O
wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me, etc. Or as a man that being
fallen into the fire, and like to be burnt, is snatched out of the same, and so
escapes the danger; so the true Christian he is ready to confess, and willing
to forsake his sin, as David, 2 Samuel 12. 13. And does forsake it, 2 Cor. 4. 2.
And afterward make amends to God and man what he can for it, Luke 19. 18. and
Zacheus stood up, etc. And Peter, Mat 26. 70, 72, 75.

For ordinary and daily frailties, the true Christian does mourn for them
daily, as he does commit and observe them, Psalm. 19. 12. Who can understand
his errors? cleanse thou me, etc. Romans 7. 22. If he fall into greater sins, he
is more deeply humbled for them, and does more emineutly repent thereof, as
Peter, Mat. 26 75. David, Psalm. 51. 1, 2, 3, etc. 2 Samuel 24, 1, 2, etc. Job 40.
1, 4, 5, etc. But otherwise it is with the Hypocrite in all these particulars.
He is pleased with his sin, and not troubled with it, but when it brings him
into trouble. Otherwise he is resolved to continue in his sin, and his sin in
him, Psalm: 36. 2, 3. He flattereth himself in his own eyes till his iniquity
be found to be hateful: Takes a special contentment in it, is never better but
when he is acting of it. And he is secure in it, and as one that is fast asleep
cannot endure to be waked, so he cannot endure to be told of his sin, to be
troubled about it: For he stiffens himself in it, is resolved because it serves
his turn, and suits with his disposition that he will not leave it, and
therefore does deny, excuse, defend, justify, or perhaps glory in it. Psalm.
36. 4. Phil. 3. 19. Whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their
shame. Hosea 12. 7, 8. Romans 2. 32.

2 He is after his fall into sin made more watchful and heedfull than
before, that he fall not into the like sin again, Joh. 21. 15, 17. Ps. 119. 29.
Remove from me the way of lying, etc. (that is) let me no more not dissemble
with God and Man as I have done, but let me be sincere according to thy Law.
But there is no such thing in the Hypocrite, the more he does, the more he may
sin, and grows worse and worse. And therefore the sin of the true Christian
is not at all imputed to him. Psalm 32. 2. Unto whom the Lord imputes not
inquitie, and in whose spirit there is no guile.

SECT. XIX.
In their growth in Grace, and the working and appearance thereof.

The true Grace of the true Christian does not use to decay, but to grow, 2
Pet. 3. 18. 2 These. 1. 3. Revel. 219. And the seeming grace of the Hypocrite
(as we have elsewhere hinted) does seemingly grow also. But there are these
differences herein.

1 The true Grace has root and life, and grows indeed. John 15. 4, 5. I am
the Vine ye are the branches, etc. He thut abides in me, and I in him, the
same brings forth much fruit. Psalm. 84. 7. They go from strength to
strength. Romans 7. 3. 4. Mat. 13. 23. It flows from the eternal Spirit of God
in the soul of a Believer, as water from a lively spring, John 4. 14. But the
counterfeit Grace of the Hypocrite has neither root nor life in it, and
grow^th but in appearance only, and it is like to a standing poole of dead and
corrupt water, which will fail in the summer time when there is most need of
it. Job 10. 16. Mat. 13. 21, 22.

2 It is a lively and working Grace, 3 These. 1. 3. Your work of faith and
labor of love. Heb. 6. 10. Your work and labor of love. 2 Cor. 5. 14. The
love of Christ constrains us, etc. and 7. 10. Godly sorrow works, etc. and
8. 24. The proof of your love. James 1 4. and 2. 8 2 These. 1. 11. Gal. 5. 6.
But the common Grace of the Hypocrite is dead, and without fruit, Mat. 13. 22.
He becomes unfruitful. Jam. 2. 17. 20.

3 The true Grace is a pure and incorruptible Grace, and therefore an enduring,
increasing, and immortal Grace, 2 These. 1. 3. Your faith grows exceedingly. 2
Pet. 1. 118. Psalm. 119. 33. 1 Io. 3 9. Whosoever is born of God does not sin;
for his seed remains in him, etc. But the common work of Grace that is
wrought in the Hypocrite is but a wordly, carnal, and corrupt work, and
therefore it decaieth, withers, and never comes to perfection, 1 John 2. 19.
They went out from us, etc. But ye have an unction, etc. Mat. 13. 20, 21, etc.
But he that received the seed in the stony places, the same is he that hears
the Word, and anon with joy receives it, yet bath he no root in himself but
dureth for a while, etc. Heb. 6. 7, 8. For the earth, etc. But that which
brings thorns and briars is rejected, and is nigh to cursing, etc. 1 Cor. 15.
19. 2 Cor. 7. 10.

SECT. XX.
In their Mohtification and Self-denial.

The true Christian does and must mortify sin, keep under his body, etc. Col.
3. 5. Romans 8. 13. The Hypocrite he does something in this also. But herein
there is this difference between them. All, or the greatest part of that which
the Hypocrite does herein is upon the outside; his care and pains is only to
appear and seem beautiful, Mat. 23. 25, 27. Ye make clean the outside, etc. but
within are full of all uncleanness, 1 Kings 21. 1, 2, 3, etc. But the maine
study and labor of the sincere Christian is to mortify his evil affections,
to put out the fire of his lust, his covetousnes, pride, uncleanness, envy,
anger, and the like, Job 31. 1. I made a covenant with mine eyes, why then
should I think on a maid? and v. 24. If I have made gold my hope, etc. Psalm
19. 12. Cleanse thou me from secret faults, etc. 1 Cor. 9. 27. But I kee, under
my body, Romans 8. 3. Col. 3. 15.

SECT. XXI,
In their new obedience in the general, and the exactness and compleatness
thereof.

The sincerre Christian, as he is a new creature, so he is to yield and perform
a new obedience to God in Christ, in his doing and suffering of the will of
God, according to the Gospel, Romans 16. 19. 26. 1 Pet. 1. 22. Romans 6. 17. The
Hypocrite he does somewhat like unto this; for the unclean spirit seems to be
cast out of him. Mat. 12. 13. But there is a vast difference between them
herein also. 1 In the person doing. 2 In the thing done. 1 In the person doing.
The sincere Christian looks to it, that he himself be rightly qualified for the
work, that he himself be good and accepted of God, that he be in Christ by
faith, and so a new creature, otherwise his works cannot be accepted. Deuteronomy. 33.
10, 11. Genesis 4. 4, 5. God had respect to Abel and his offering, etc. But the
hypocrite has no regard of this, but being still in his sins, and without the
wedding garment of Christ's righteousness upon him, his work is not accepted,
God hears not sinners, Joh 9. 31. Mat. 24. 11, 12. Pro. 28. 9. 2 In the thing
done. The obedience of the sincere Christian flows from the true and right
principle, viz the new nature from his being renewed by the Spirit of God,
Phil. 1. 11. But the the obedience of the Hypocrite flows from corrupt
principles, 1 Pet. 1. 22, 23.

2 The new obedience of the sincere Christian is regular and orderly. He is
first taught, and commanded, he hears what he is to believe and do, and then
he is obedient to it. Jer. 31. 19. After that I was instructed, I smote upon
the thigh, etc. Acts 9. 6. and 16. 30. and 2. 37, 38. Isa. 2. 2. Ephesians. 1. 13.
In whom ye trusted after that ye heard the word, etc. Romans 10. 14, 15. But the
obedience of the Hypocrite is often times a blind and irregular obedience not
grounded upon, and warranted by the Word of God, but upon his own, or some
other man's fancy and opinion. Romans 10. 1, 2. They have a zeal of God, but not
according to knowledge.

3 He does it knowingly and beleevingly; he not only has a word for what he
believes, and does, but he knows he has such a word for it, and so does it
in faith, which the Hypocrite heedeth little, and therefore is not accepted,
Romans 14. 1, 2, 3, etc. Heb. 11. 4, 6. Acts 17. 23.

4 The new obedience of the sincere Christian is an exact and complete
obedience; 1 it is universal. He is holy in all manner of conversation, and
yields himself to do and suffer all that God will have him. 1 Pet. 1. 15. But
that of the Hypocrite is lame and defective. And the obedience of the sincere
Christian it is universal.

1 As to the things to be obeyed.

2 It is entire, as to the man that does obey As to the first; the Hypocrite he
is lame and defective in this. His obedience is but by halves, or in part
only, as Jehu, Saul, and others, Mal. 2. 9. And have been partial in my Law.
Hosea 7. 8. Ephraim is a cake not turned. He does as Herod, Mark 6. 20. did
many things, not all that God commanded. But the true Christian, he is through
paced in his goings herein, as were Caleb and Joshua, who followed the Lord
fully, Numb. 14. 24. and 32. 12. Deuteronomy. 1. 36. and David, who had respect to all
Gods commandments. Psalm. 119. 6. and Paul, who had a conscience void of
offense toward God, and toward man, Acts 24. 16. and Zachary and Elizabeth,
who walked in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless, Luke
1. 6. But more particularly. The sincere Christian he cease from doing all
that is evil, and he does all that is good, Isa. 1. 6. The Hypocrite, he does
not cease from all that is evil; for either he is erroneous in his opinion, as
those in 2 Pet. 2. and Jude 1, 2, etc. 1 Cor. 15. 12. or in his practice, or in
both. Or (at the most and at the best) he does depart from evil only in his
outside, his heart is where it was still, psalm. 58. 2. Yea in heart ye work
wickedness, Psalm. 52. 3. And some evil or other he does most commonly retain
in his life still, as Judas he kept his covetousness still, Joh. 12. 6. Herod
he kept his brothers wife still, Mark 6. 18. 20. Iehu whiles he boasts so much
of the zeal he had for the Lord, and the uprightness of his heart therein,
depart not from the sins of Iereboam which made Israel to sin. 2 Kings 10. 15,
31. Saul whiles he pretends so much tenderness of conscience in smaller
matters, yet carries still within him his murdrous intentent to kill David, 1 Samuel 14. 33, 44. and 18. 10. and 20. 5. Exodus 16. 28, 29 2 Kings 5. 18. Zephan.
1. 5. Hosea 7. 7, 8, 9, 10. Isaiah 65. 3, 4, 5, 6. But the sincere Christian
he leaves all that is evil, in opinion, in practice, in heart, in life. The
sin of his love and delight, inclination, age, temper, and constitution,
profit, trade, office, calling; that which he is most tempted to, his open, his
secret, his greater and his lesser sins. So David, Psalm. 119. 128. I hate
every false way, and 101. 3. I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes. and
119. 101. I have refrained my feet from every evil way. and 18. 23. I kept my
self from mine intiquitie Psalm, 19. 12. Cleanse thou me from secret faults. So
Job from the sin of his inclination, he would not look on a maid; of his
calling, as a Magistrate, he despised not the cause of the meanest; of his
condition, as a rich man, he would not oppress the poor; he kept from the sin
of his affection, occasion, and profit, Job 31. throughout the chapter. And for
the second part; the sincere Christian as he does cease from all that is evil,
so he does all that is good. The Hypocrite, many of them I mean, have not an
appearance of some Graces, Acts 8. 21. Thine heart is not right, etc. Mat. 9.
13. Either he is failing in his doing, or in his suffering. He is commonly
failing in the doing of some duties or works. So the Pharisees, Mat. 23. 23,
24. and have omitted the weighty matters of the Law, judgment, mercy, and
truth, etc. Hosea 7. 7. 8, etc. Ephraim has mixed himself amon^st the people,
etc. he is a cake half baked, etc. Mat. 15. 2. Ye transgressed the
commandments of God by your traditions. But the sincere Christian he is
complete in all the will of God, he has somewhat of every Grace, Col. 2. 10.
You are complete in him. Heb. 13. 21. He is careful to perform all duties to
God and man, to other men, to himself. To other men, to good men, to bad men,
to friends, to enemies, to acquaintance, to strangers. In relation, as
Magistrate, Minister, People, Husband, Wife, Parent, Child, Master, Servant,
etc. Duties of Word, of Work, greater, lesser, public, private; of more and
less advantage, as Cornelius, Acts 10. 2. who was a devout man, one that gave
much alms to the people, and prayed to God always. Luke 1 6. And he does also
suffer all that God shall call him to suffer. Acts 21. 12. 13. And all this for
the leaving of evil, and the doing of good. The sincere Christian does his
duty, 1 In all places. The Hypocrite he is not so careful and exact in some,
as he is in other places, at home and in private, as he is abroad and in
public, Mat. 6. 5. The Pharisees were in appearance very devout, and did much
in the Sinagogues, and in the streets, but did nothing at all in their closets.
But the sincere Christian having his eye upon God, who is in all places alike,
is alike careful and exact in all places, in private as in public, at home as
abroad, in his closet as in his house, secretly as openly. So Joseph, Genesis 39.
9, 10. when tempted by his wanton Mistress to commit secret wickedness with her,
answers her, How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God? Psalm
101. 2. I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.

2 In all times, cases and conditions. The Hypocrite, he is good at some times,
and in some cases, as in times of peace and prosperity, and times wherein he
may gain, and not lose by his goodness, or whiles he is a wed by the presence
of good men, Parents, Magistrates, or Ministees, and the like, and no longer.
And so it seems it was with Joash, 2 Chronicles. 24. 2. Who did tho* which was right
in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jehoiadah the Priest. And such are
those servants, Ephesians 6. 6. That serve their masters with eye service as men
pleasers, etc. Job 27. 10. Will he always call upon God? But the true
Christian is alike good and careful in all times, cases, changes, and
conditions, in time of health as time of sickness, in time of peace as in time
of trouble, Phil. 4. 11. I have learned in whatsoever estate I am therewith to
be content. Job 1. 8. 12, 21, 22. And he is the same in the presence of God
only, and when no other eye is upon him, Phil. 2. 12. As ye have always
obeyed not in my presence only, but much more in my absence, etc. Ephesians. 6. 5,
6, 7. Servants be obedient, etc. in singleness of heart as unto Christ, etc.
Col. 3. 22. And he is the same in time of the persecuted, as he is in the time
of the flouring state of the Gospel. He can (if need be) leave all for Christ,
and the Gospels sake, 2 Cor. 6. 4, 5. But in all things approving our selves,
etc. in afflictions, etc. 2 Cor. 8. 9. We had the sentence of death in our
selves, etc. v. 12. in simplicity and godly sincerity, we have had our
conversation, etc. Mark 10. 28. We have left all and followed thee. Acts 21.
12, 13. I am ready not only to be bound, but also to dye at Jerusalem for the
Name of the Lord Jesus, 2 Cor. 11. 26, 27. Psalm 119. 157, 161.

3 In all company. The Hypocrite he is commonly better in some, than he is in
other company, 2 Chronicles. 24. 2. But the true Christian he is alike in all
company, in the company of good, of bad men, of friends, of enemies, Psalm 119.
46. I will speak of thy testimonies before Kings, Phil. 2. 12. as ye have
obeyed not only in my presence, etc.

4 The true Christian holds out to the end: The Hypocrite, he is at the best,
unstable in all his ways, James 1. 8. as a cloud without water carried by the
wind. Jude v. 12. apt to start aside like a deceitful bow. Hosea 7. 16. He is
very like to start aside in times of trial. Job 27. 10. Will he always call
upon God? And he does very often fall clean away to profaneness in life,
heresy, and opinion, or to both. 1 John 2. 19. they went out from us, but they
were not of us. 2 Pet. 2 22. It is happened to them according to the Proverb,
The Dog is turned to the vomit again. and the low that was washed to her
wallowing in the mire. 2 Timothy 4. 10. 1 Samuel 13. 8. and 28. 7. Mat. 13. 21, 22.
But this the sincere Christian connot do Mat. 24. 14. They shall deceive if it
were possible the very elect. For this new obedience of his is both a growing
and increasing obedience Rev. 2. 19. His last works are better than his first.
And it is a lasting, persevering, and continuing obedience. Psalm. 119. 112. I
have inclined my heart to perform thy statutes, always even to the end, v. 24.
continnally for ever and ever, Luke 2. 37. Yea and he does commonly grow better
and better, Ephesians. 2. 21. 2 These. 1. 3. But the Hypocrite he does commonly
grow worse and worse, 2 Timothy 3. 13. But Seducers wox worse and worse,
deceiving, and being deceived, etc. 2 Pet. 2. 20. This new obedience therefore
of the new creature is such, as it breaks through, and gets over all
impediments, Acts 2. 42. Such as these (i.) men's commands and threats. Acts 4.
19. Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken to you more than unto
God judge ye? and 5. 29. We ought to obey God rather than men, Dan. 3. 12. 16.

2 Men's examples of all sorts. Josh. 24. 15. Choose you this day whom you will
serve, etc. But as for me and my house we will serve the Lord. Genesis 6. 9. and
7. 1.

3 Worldly profits and advantages, such as honor, pleasure, riches, and the
like. Heb. 11. 8. By faith Abraham when he was called to go out, etc. went,
etc. and Moses v. 24, 25. when he came to years he refused, etc. choosing
rather, etc.

4 Carnal reasonings. Heb. 11. 7. By faith Noah being warned of God in a dream,
Gal. 1. 16, 17. I conferred not with flesh and blood. etc.

5 Relations and natural affections dependant upon them. Heb. 11. 17. By faith
Abraham when he was tried offered up, etc. his son, his only son, Deuteronomy. 33.
9.

But 2. the obedience of the sincere Christian is complete and entire also as
to him that obeys; for it is the obedience of his whole man body and soul.
The obedience of the Hypocrite is commonly counterfeit, and not from his heart;
sometimes with a part of his heart only, and never with his whole heart, Ezekiel.
33. 31. There is action without affection, the lips are without the heart in
it. It comes coldly from him, without any vigor or life of the inner man,
Ezech. 33. 31. their heart goes after their covetousness, Isa. 29. 13. This
people draw nigh to me with their mouth but their heart is far from me, Ps.
78. 34, 35, 36. They returned and enquired early after God, nevertheless they
did flatter him with their mouth, etc. for their heart was not right with him,
etc. Jer. 3. 10. And yet, etc. her treacherous Sister Judah has not turned
unto me with hgr whole heart but feignedly, etc. Amos 8. 5, 6. Hosea 7. 14. But
the new obedience of the sincere Christian is a cordial and affectionate
obedience of the whole inward and outward man both together. That which he
believes, and that which he does, or leaves undone, it is all frrom his very
heart. Romans 6. 17. You have obeyed from the heart the Doctrine, etc. And it is
with the whole heart, Ps. 119. 10, 145 With my whole heart have I sought thee,
etc. So that what he does he does with his whole soul, mind, conscience, will,
and affections all concurring with him therein. He does with all his might and
strength desire, and endeavor to do the whole will of God, Psalm. 119. 10. 34.
69. I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart, Acts 8. 37. If thou believe
with all thy heart, etc. His grace within, and his work without is unfeigned, 2 Timothy 1. 5. 2 Cor. 6. 6. 1 Samuel 12. 20. Ezekiel. 11. 19, 20. Romans 12. 8.

5 As he is careful to do all God requires, and with the whole man, so is he
careful to do no more than God requires. But the Hypocrite has additions of
his own and other men's inventions, Jer 32. 35. Ps. 106. 39. Mat. 15. 2, 3. etc.

6 The new obedience of the sincere Christian is a real obedience. 1 That of
the Hypocrite is only verbal and complemental, Mat. 21. 28, 29, 30. A certain
man had two sons, and he said to one of them, Go and work to day in my
vineyard; And he said, I go sir, but went not. 1 Ioh. 3. 17, 18. Let us not
love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth. Luke 6. 45. And why
call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the thing which I say? But the obedience of
the sincere Christian is an obedience that is in deeds as well as in words,
Romans 15. 18. Col. 3. 17. 2 That of the Hypocrite is feigned and counterfeit, as
we have showed, Ps. 78. 36. But this of the sincere Christian is as he himself
is indeed what he seems.

7 This new obedience of the sincere Christian as it is exact and complete for
the matter so for the manner of it, and the mind of the doer therein. The
Hypocrite he only minds the work done, and not how it be done, or with
what mind he does it. But the sincere Christian is careful not only what he
does, but how and with what mind he does it. And for this he does and suffers
it (i.) in Christ's name, where the Hypocrite does dare adventure to go to God
in his own name, and upon his own account, without the name of Jesus Christ, as
Mat. 22. 1, 2, 13 etc. He saw there a man that had not on a wedding garment,
etc. Luke 18. 11 the Pharisee prayed, and said, God I thank thee, I am not,
etc. John 6. 64. and 7. 5. or otherwise ask doubtingly, James 1. 7, 8. The
sincere Christian he dares not come to God but with Jesus Christ in his heart
and mouth; and so coming, he believes that he shall be accepted both in his
person and service. He does ask in faith: his Prayer is the prayer of Faith,
James 5. 15, 16. 1 Timothy 2. 8. James 1. 6. Heb. 11. 4, 6. By Faith Abel offered
to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, etc. But without Faith it is
impossible to please him; for he that comes to God must believe, John 16, 23,
24. and 14 6.

2 He does, and suffers preparedly: where the Hypocrites heart in his coming
to God in service is altogether unprepared for it, as being void of the love
and fear, and reverence of God in it, 2 Chronicles 12. 14, and 20 23. Psalm. 78. 34,
35, 36. Isa. 29. 13. The sincere Christian his heart is ready and prepared to
and for his obedience in doing or suffering as an instrument when set in tune
is ready to be played upon. He loves and fears God; he has high, holy, and
reverend thoughts of Gods name, ways, and worship, etc. 2 Chronicles. 30 9. Psalm
108. 1. Psalm. 57. 7 Romans 1, 15 Mal 1. 6, 7, 8, 17. Deuteronomy. 10. 12. Acts 21. 13.

3 He does it sincerely, where the Hypocrite does it with a double and
deceitful heart all that he does, Psalm. 78. 34, etc. James 4. 8. The sincere
Christian he does it with a true and plain heart, Heb. 10 22. Romans 12. 8, 9. 1
Pet. 1 2. So the Magistrate ruling, Romans 12. 7, 8. The Minister in preaching, 2
Cor. 1. 12. 1 These 2. 4, 5, 6, etc. but to this we have spoken before.

4 He does it cheerfully and joyfully. Where the Hypocrite is in his obedience
(especially in the service of God) unwilling to, and unchearfull in it, and
takes little or no delight, but is soon weary of, and tired in it, Amos 8. 5.
When will the new Moon be gone? etc. Mal. 1. 15. Behold what a weariness it is.
Job 27. 10. The true Christian he delights in it, it is his meat and drink;
the yoke herein upon him is an easy yoke to him, Psalm. 40 8. Mat 11. 30.
Psalm. 119 47. I shall delight my self in thy Commandments, 2 Cor, 8. 19. 1 Pet
5. 2. 2 Cor 9 7. Isa. 58. 13. If thou call the Sabbath a delight. 1 Cor. 29 9.
Heb. 10. 34. Ye took joyfully the spoiling of yourgoods. Judges 5. 2. And hence
are the sincere Christians said to be a willing people, Ps. 110. 3.

5 He does it patiently. Where the Hypocrite is commonly in that which he does
and suffers impatient and complaining against God, Mal. 3. 14, 15. Ye say it
is in vain to serve the Lord, etc. 2 Kings 6. 33. This evil is from the Lord,
what should I wait, etc. Ezekiel. 18. 25, 29 and 33. 17. 20. Numb. 14. 17. Psalm.
106. 25. Mat. 20. 12, 15. Mat. 25. 23, 24. The sincere Christian he is
patient, and does quietly submit to the will of God therein, 1 Samuel 3. 17, 18.
It is the Lord let him do what seems him good. 2 Kings 20. 19, Good is the
word of the Lord. Job 1. 21. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken, etc.

6 He does it diligently, where the Hypocrite is commonly in his obedience
especially in Gods service careless and negligent, Mal. 1. 14. Which has in
his flock a male, and sacrifices to the Lord a corrupt thing, etc. Mat. 25.
24. He that had but one talent. The sincere Christian is usuually very diligent
and exact herein, 2 Pet. 1. 12. I will not be negligent, etc. 2 Cor. 8. 22. 1 Timothy 4. 14.

7 He does it humbly, where the Hypocrite does his work proudly, and
conceitedly, as the Pharisee, Luke 18. 11. The sincere Christian does it with
the sense of his sin, and with a broken and contrite heart. Luke 18. 13.

8 He does it fervently, where the Hypocrite is cold and perfunctory in his
service. Rev. 3. 15. The sincere Christian is fervent in spirit, and does what
he does fervently, Coll. 4. 12. James 5 16. Romans 12. 14.

9 He does it lovingly, where the Hypocrite does it often with corrupt
affections. James 15. 16. amd 1. 19, 20. The sincere Christian does it with
love to God and man, 1 Timothy 2. 8. 1 Cor. 13. 1. 1 Cor. 5. 8. He does it not
with the leaven of malice tnd wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of
sincerity and truth.

10 He does it purely and holily. The obedience of the sincere Christian is not
only pure for the manner, but it flows from pure principles and motives; and
is done by a pure rule, and ^o pure ends.

2 It comes from a pure heart. That of the Hypocrite comes from a filthy heart,
Acts 8. 21, 22. Mat. 23. 25. But this of the sincere Christian comes from a
pure heart, a heart purified by the blood of Christ, and by the Spirit of
Christ. 1 Timothy 1. 5,

2 It is pure in the motives. by, and from which it is moved and carried. That
which does move and carry the Hypocrite in his obedience, is his self-love, and
self ends, and not any thing at all of God: he loves not the commander, the
command, nor the thing commanded for themselves. Or if there be any thing of
God in it, it is so much only as may serve his own ends therein, Mat. 6 1, 2,
etc. Mat. 23. throughout. So Jehu. Saul, Judas, and the rest.

He may sometimes be kept from the doing of evil perhaps by the fear of men,
but very seldom by the fear of God, Mark 12. 12. Luke 20. 19, 22. 2 John 9. 22.
and 7. 17. and 19. 38. Mat. 14. 5. Mark 11. 32. Genesis 39. 9. But that especially
which does move the sincere Christian in his obedience, is the love and fear of
God. And from thence his desire to please, and his fear to offend God, the
goodness of the thing to be done or suffered, the conscience of his duty
therein, and of his obligation thereunto by the love of God. He believes the
promises because God says, and obeyes the commands because God gives them. He
loves the Law maker that commands, the Law or command it self, and the thing
commanded. These, and such like things as these do especially stir up, and
carry on the sincere Christian to his obedience. So Heb. 11. 7. By Faith Noah
being warned of God of things not seen, moved with fear prepared an Ark, etc.
Psalm 119. 161. My heart stands in awe of thy word, 2 Cor. 5. 14. For the
love of Christ constrains us, etc. 1. 17. Some out of love, Psalm 116. 1. I
love the Lord, etc. John 21 15. and 16, 17. Ps. 119. 97. 127. I loae thy Law
Psalm 40. 8. I delight to do thy will, O God. Gen 39. 9. Job 31. 4. 14. 23. 2 Chronicles. 19. 6, 7. Ephesians. 6. 6, 7.

And this fear of God makes him careless of the commands and threats of men,
Exodus 1. 17. The Midwives feared God, etc. Heb. 11. 27. By Faith be forsook
Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the King.

2 It is pure in the Rule by which his obedience is governed. The Hypocrite, he
makes his own fancy, and the commands and inventions of other men his rule and
warrant for what he does therein. Mat. 15. 2. Why do thy disciples transgress
the traditions of the Elders? etc. Gal. 1. 14. John 4. 21, 22. Acts 17. 22.
Mat. 23. 16, 17. But the sincere Christian, he makes the pure Word of God alone
his rul e and warrant for whatsoever he believes, does and suffers, Col. 3.
10. The new man is said to be renewed in knowledge, Gal. 1. 9. Gal. 6. 16. Acts
13. 36.

3 It is also pure for the manner of it, as is already showed.

4 This new obedience is pure in the ends of it. The Hypocrites end in all that
he does and suffers is himself, as he is moved in his obedience from
self-love, so is he carried to self ends. He seeks himself, not God and Christ,
his main design and intention in all that he does and suffers from the
beginning to the end thereof, is especially, if not only his own glory or
praise, his own profit, or pleasure, or some way or other to satisfy his own
lusts. He looks no furthan at earthly pleasures, comforts, and advantages in
this world. God is not in all his thoughts, or if he be, it is only to think
how he may serve himself upon him. And if God be in his eye, yet he looks at
something beyond, above, above or before him. In show he seeks God, but in
truth he seeks himself. He seems to follow God and Christ, but it is not for
God and Christ, but for his own sake. He follows Christ for the loaves, as the
nine Leapers to be healed only, John 6. 26. Luke 17. 12. And as the sheep do
follow the shepherd as long as the bottle of hay is in his hand, and no
longer; and not as a child that follows the father out of love, who will follow
him every where. The Pharisees did pray and give alms to be seen of men, Mat.
6. 2. They made long prayers to the end they might devour widows houses.
Hosea 7. 14. Ye assemble for wine and corn. Zach 7. 5. Did ye at all fast unto
me? etc. Micah 3. 11. They judge for ieward, and divine for money, and yet lean
upon me, etc. Acts 20 30. Phil. 1. 17. Preached Christ out of envy. But the
sincere Christian in all his active and passive obedience, as he is carried
forth therein especially from the love and fear of God and Christ, so does he
act therein for God and Christ as well as for himself. And indeed God is his
great object, motive, end, and all in all: He follows them as well for their
own sakes as for his own sake. They are his principal and ultimate end, and
the center to which he tends in all that he does and suffers. His main scope
and special aim therein to which all is in his intention referred is to
glorify God, and advance the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and to testify
his love to God; for the love of God showed to him in Christ. And therefore it
does not satisfy him to do any thing as for the public good, the Common
wealth, or the like. So the Heathen men have done, unless he go higher, and
shoot as far as the utmost white and mark of all, which is Gods glory; he
cannot be satisfied to come short of this, or to go beyond it with reference
to any thing else. Romans 14. 8. Whether we live we live to the Lord, etc. Phil.
1. 21. For me to live is Christ, etc. Luke 17. 12. The Leapers one of them when
he saw he was healed returned and glorified God, etc. 1 Timothy 1. 17. Now to
the King immortal, etc. 1 Timothy 6. 16. Rev. 4. 11. Thou art worthy to receive
glory, etc. Rev. 5. 12. Saying with a loud voice, worthy is the Lamb, etc.
Psalm 115. 1. Not unto us, but to thy Name, etc. So John the Baptist of Christ,
John 3. from verse 27 to the end. John 1. 19, 20, etc. This is the record of
John, etc. And he confessed and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Christ,
etc. He is from heaven, etc. He must increase, etc. 2 Cor. 4. 5. We preach not
our selves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, etc. Joshua 7. 9. What will thou do for
thy great Name, etc. Psalm 111. 9. Holy and reverend is his Name. John 14. 14.
Psalm 44. 22. For thy sake are we killed all the day long, we, etc. Luke 2.
14, 20. Canticl. 7. 13. Deuteronomy. 28. 58. Hab. 3. 17. 1 These. 2. 4. Even so we
speak not as pleasing men, but God, etc. Gal. 1. 10. or do I seek to please
men, etc. And therefore he does so, because this is required by the Gospel of
him, 1 Cor. 6. 20. Ye are bought with a price wherefore, glorify him, etc. 1
Cor. 10. 31. do all to the glory of God, etc. Col. 3. 17. Whatsoever ye do in
word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God,
and the Father by him, Mat. 6. 9. 13.

And next to Gods glory the true Christian he does in his obedience active and
passive aim at, and design the good of all men, especially of godly men: So
Paul, 1 Cor. 10. 33. Even as I not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of
many that they may be saved. So David, Acts 13. 36. After he had served his
own generation, etc. Ps. 78. 72. Luke 7. 5, 6. Gal. 6. 10. Acts 20. 35. 1 Cor.
8. 8, 9, 10.

And in the last place next to Gods glory, and the good of other men, he does
design his own spiritual good here, and the salvation of his body and soul
hereafter, 1 Cor. 9. 27. 1 Timothy 4. 16. Acts 2. 40.

And in this order of his working to those ends he does not only follow the
light of Gods Word, but the light of Nature, which some of the Heathen saw and
taught. That man was not born for himself; but first for God, next for his
country, and lastly for himself.

SECT. XXII.
In their affections and manifestations thereof as to Christ's appearing, as to
enemies, the sins of the times, troubles of the Churrh, love to the world, holy
duties, to works of mercy and justice, receipts of gifts, order of Gods
working, reformation of his family, and in their assurance of salvation.

And finally the sincere Christian also does more or less commonly outstrip the
Hypocrite in all these things that follow.

1 He does more or less love, long, pray, and prepare for Christ's appearing to
judgment, Rev. 22. 17. The Spirit and the Bridegroom say come. Cant. 1. 14.
Make have my beloved. 1 Cor. 1. 7. Waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus,
Mat. 25. 1, 2, 3, etc. 2 Timothy 4. 8. This the Hypocrite cannot endure to hear
of, or think upon, or prepare for, Is. 33. 14. The sinners in Sion are afraid,
fearfulness has surprised the Hypocrites. Rev. 6. 16. And said to the
mountains and rocks fall on us, and hide us from the face, etc. And from the
wrath of the Lamb.

2 He can love his enemies, and do good for evil, Acts 7. 59. 60. They stoned
Stephen. And he cried, etc. Lord lay not this sin to their charge. Job. 31.
29, 30. If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, etc. Mat. 23.
32. and 5. 43, 44. But this the Hypocrite cannot do, Mat. 5. 46. If ye love
them that love you, what reward have you.

3 He does grieve and mourn for, and make opsition against the sins of the time
and place wherein he lives, 2 Pet. 2. 7. For that righteous man in seeing and
hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds, Ps.
119. 136. Rivers of water run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy Law.
But it is otherwise with the Hypocrite, who does many times rather rejoice in
the sins of others and join with them then mourn because of the same, Psalm
50. 16. 18.

4 He can does more or less sympathize and fellow-feel in the troubles of his
brethren, pity and help them, 2 Cor. 11. 29. Who is weak and I am not weak?
etc. Nehem. 1. 2, 3, 4. When I heard these words I sat down and wept etc. Ps.
112. 4. Romans 12. 4, 5. at which many Hypocrites do rather rejoice. Obadiah 12.
13. But thou should not have looked on the day of thy brother, etc. neither
should thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their
destruction. Psalm 35. 25. So would we have it, Mat. 27. 41. The chief Priests
mocking him said, he saved others, etc.

5 He can and does more or less live above the world, and trample the honors,
pleasures, and profits thereof under his feet, Rev. 12. 1. A woman clothed
with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet. Galat. 6. 14 God forbid I should
rejoice in any thing but the cross of our Lord Jesus, by whom the world is
crucified to me, and I unto the world. Job 31. 24, 25. If I have made gold my
hope, etc. or rejoiced because my wealth was great, etc. Heb. 11. 24, 25. 2 Timothy 3. 2, 4. Phil. 3. 7. 19, 20. But the Hypocrite is not so, but commonly is
covetous, a lover of the world, his pleasure, his profit, or his honor. 2 Timothy
3. 2, 4. Lovers of themselves, covetous. 2 Timothy 4. 10. Lovers of pleasures.
Mat. 23. 25.

6 He can, and does, having a low esteem of himself and his own deserts,
thankfully acknowledge his receipts of benefits from God. Genesis 32. 10. I am not
worthy of the least of all thy mercies, etc. Mat. 8. 8. Lord I am not worthy
that thou should come under my roof, Luke 17. 15. And one of them when he saw
that he was healed turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God. Psalm 26.
7. 2 Samuel 7. 18. But the Hypocriee having high thoughts of himself, and his own
worth and works, as if God were beholding to him for his service to him, he is
commonly very unthankful for what he receives from God. Luke 17. 14, 15. As in
nine of the ten Leapers. Isa. 58. 3. We have fasted, and thou regardest it not.

7 The sincere Christian he is careful to submit to Gods means, and go Gods
ways for the attainment and accomplishment of Gods ends. But the Hypocrite he
will not stick at the use of any unlawful means to bring to pass Gods end,
when it may also suit with his own end therein, Hab. 2. 3, 4.

8 The sincere Christian he does much more labor against the sins of his own
family, and relations. But the Hypocrite he looks al abroad, and takes no care
at home, he is bitter against the sins of others, and seems very active many
times in the reformation of the evil that is abroad, but does nothing at hom.
Mat. 7. 1, 3. Mat. 23. 15. Why see thou the mote, etc.

9 The sincere Christian is commonly of a more composed spirit and behavior in
prosperity and adversity than the Hypocrite is, Phil. 4. 11. I have learned
in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content. Job 2. 9, 10, and 21. The
Lord has given, and the Lord has taken, etc. But the Hypocrite, in such times
is commonly more discomposed, and disturbed in time of adversity he does
despair, 2 Kings 6. 33. What should I wait for the Lord any longer. And in
time of prosperity he is lifted up to forget the Lord and himself both, Psalm.
106 throughout

10 He is, and does show himself to be really more merciful, just, true,
loving, meek, humble, and peaceable in heart, word, and work than the Hypocrite
is, who is, and very often shows himself more fraudulent, unjust, ambitious,
cruel, envious, contentious. John 1. 30. and 3. 28. 1 Cor. 4. 6. Micah 6 8 Mat.
33. 5, 6, 12, 13. 3 John 9. Luke 18. 10, 12. Isa. 65 5. Job 31 throughout.

11 And lastly, some sincere Christians are by the witness of the Spirit of
God in them, some more, some less, assured of their interest in Christ, and
their part in eternal life, 1 Io. 5. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. He that beleeveeth, etc.
has the witness in himself, etc. Heb. 10. 15. 1 John 4. 13. Hereby know we
that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit,
Romans 8. 16. The Spirit it self bears witness with our spirit, that we are the
children of God. Ephesians. 1. 13. Ye were sealeo by that holy Spirit of promise.
And in this the Hypocrite has no share at all. But many of them lie and dye
under the fear of eternal vengeance from God, as the just reward of his
Hypocrisy, and none of them ever had any true and well grounded assurance,
Ier. 33. 14. The sinners in Sion are afraid, fearfulness has surprithe
Hypocrites. Rev. 6. 16.

SECT. XXIII.
So that now (upon the whole matter) we may perceive that the sincere
Christian does out strip, and go beyond the Hypocrite throughout.

1 Quoad principium gratiae, as to his Foundation, Root, or Spring, the
immortal, and incorruptible seed of Grace in the New Creature, he is
Regenerate. But the Hypocrite is not so. And therefore that which is wrought in
him is a corruptible thing that will never come to good.

2 Quoad incrementum gratiae, as to the increase of Grace he does more or less
grow and increase in Grace. But it is otherwise with the Hypocrite, who
commonly after a little while does grow worse and worse.

3 Quoad exercitium gratiae; as he has every grace so it is as true that his
graces put him upon the exercise of them, but the graces of hypocrites are but
seemingly such, their faith being but a dead Faith. And as for that work of
Grace in a sincere Christian which lies in the external actings he does
excel also in these things.

1 That which he does he does by the right rule of Gods Word, which shows the
will of God, and he does all that. But the Hypocrite he follows his own, and
the will of other men, and at the most he does but a part of Gods will only.

2 He does that which he does in a right manner with the whole heart. But the
Hypocrite otherwise.

3 He does that which he does to the right end, to Gods glory, and not to the
praise of himself as the hypocrite does.

SECT. XXIV.
But by all this we have spoken of the complete and exact obedience of the
sincere Christian, we do not intend, nor would be understood that the sincere
Christians life is perfect, and without sin; for that is to affirm contrary
to what the Holy Ghost affirms, and experience has evidenced to us of the
lives of all men, and the best men that ever lived, that they all had their
faults, and to assure us thereof, some of them, yea very many of them are
recorded in Scripture, and left us for our learning, to let us know that there
is not a man that lives and sineth not. The phrases of speech therefore which
we have used, and that which we have affirmed of the obedience of the sincere
Christian, that he leaves all sin, and does all duties at all times, and in
all places, cases, etc. And the Phrases of the Scripture applied to the Saints,
that they followed the Lord fully, were in all the commandments of God
blameless, and were perfect, they are to be understood not in a legal or in a
litteral, but in an Evangelical sense: For doubtless the utte^most obedience
that is expected, or that can be performed by the most absolute and perfect
Christian that is most sincere is. That he has a real and unfeigned will, and
desire, and a real intention and purpose, and does his endeavor with all his
might to do and fulfill the whole will of God therein. And he is grieved that he
cannot do it more perfectly. And that which he does of it he does in
sincerity. And when he has done all, he thinks himself to be but an
unprofitable servant, and to have done less than was his duty to do. And he
does not trust to himself therein but to the Righteousness of God in Christ.
And in this only or especially in this point does the sincere Christian
eminently excel and outstrip all the Hypocrites, yea the most refined
Hypocrites in the world, who have not any such unfeigned will, desire, purpose,
or intention (but rather the contrary thereof) in them. Nor do they endeavor
at all so to do in all things as we have showed elsewhere at large. And this
progress toward the perfect doing in the sincere Christian is esteemed with
God as the perfect doing of the thing it self, Heb. 11. 17. By Faith Abraham
when he was tried offered up Isaac, etc. 1 Cor. 8. 12. For if there be first
a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man has, etc.. We are here
also to add this caution further in reference to all that we have spoken to
this head, that the feigned Graces of the Hypocrites and their gifts, are in
some hearts so like to true Grace, that it is hard to distinguish them. And in
the hearts of the most sincere, corrupt affections and motions stir so much,
that it is hard to conclude any thing certainly and definitively herein, more
or further than this. That the more we find of the motions and operations of
Sincerity, the more cause we have to judge our selves sincere. And the more we
see of the motions and operatious of Hypocrisy, the more cause we have to
suspect our selves thereof. All these things therefore are cautiously to be
heeded and used. But for this see more in the beginning of the next Chapter. If
yet you shall desire to see some more certain signs of the sincere man, and of
the Hypocrite, we shall endeavor to give you some of them in the nevt Chapter.

CHAP. VIII.
How Sincerity and Hypocrisy are manifested. Or, The signs of Sincerity and
of Hypocrisy.

This question is partly answered before in Chapter 3. where we have set
forth, wherein Sincerity and Hypocrisy do consist. And again in Chap. 7.
wherein we have showed, in what the sincere Christian does differ from, and go
beyond the Hypocrite. But we shall now in this place add further some
particulars wherein Sincerity and Hypocrisy do most eminently show themselves
in the Professors of Religion, and these also may serve for signs and marks
thereof. And these we shall also lay down the one aghinst the other in way of
opposition. But herein we must premise four things by way of caution.

1 That amongst these signs of Hypocrisy, some are more gross and palpable
than others.

2 That neither the one, nor the other, on the one or on the other side, albeit
they be certain and infallible in themselves, yet may they not be so to us,
whose hearts are deceitful above all things, and we are so apt to be deceived
by them. We do not propose them therefore as aosolutely certain and
infallible as to us: For many of the things we give, and lay down through
this whole work as signs or marks of the sincere Christian, some appearance
of the same things may be found in, and upon the Hypocrite. As for example. He
may seem to have some delight in God. Job 27. 10. He may have some delight in
good things. Matthew. 13. 20. Mark 6. 20. Isaiah 58. 2. and good men and their
company. Mat. 25. 1, 2, 3, etc. So the foolish seemed to delight in the company
of the wise Virgins. He may have an appearance of all the graces of the Spirit
within him, and seem to grow in them for a long time, perhaps to his dying day.
Mat. 13. 4, 5, 6. 20, 21, 22. Luke 6. 46. He may be a constant Hearer of the
Word of GOD, and yield some obedience thereunto, as Herod, Amaziah, and
others. 2 Chronicl. 25. 2, 9, 15, 16. Luke 6, 46, 47. Mark 6. 18, 19, 20. He
may deny himself in many things, avoid evil, and repent of sin, as Ahab,
Saul, Judas, others, and do many other things, as we have before laid down at
large. And on the other side, many of the things we have observed, or shall
here further observe to be the signs, or marks, or workings of Hypocrisy. The
likeness, or resemblance, or (at the least) some degrees thereof, or the thing
it self at some iime may be found in the sincere Christian. As for example, we
read of them in Scripture, or of some of them, at some time, or in some case
unbelieving, Mat. 14. 31. Romans 14. 23. Mat. 6. 30. Despising God and the
commandment of God. 2 Samuel 12. 9, 10. Hypocritical. Gal. 2. 12, 13.
Unthankful, 2 Chronicles 32 25. Barren and unfruitful under the means of Grace. Heb.
6. 1, 2, 3. John 14. 9. Negligent about holy duties. 1 Cor. 11 20, 21, etc.
Falling off from Christ in case of persecution. John 18. 15, 16, etc. John 17.
13. and 9. 22. Fearing of an open profession of the Gospel because of
persecution. John 19. 38. Impatient and discontented at Gods works. Jonah 4. 1,
2, 3. Job 3. 1, etc. Impatient and wrathful against man. 2 Chronicles. 16. 10.
Covetous or loving the world. 1 John 2. 15. 1 Cor. 5. 10. Iame. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Lifted up with pride. 2 Samuel 24. 10. Mark 9. 34. 2 Chronicles. 32. 24, 25, 26, 31. 2
Kings 20. 12. Injurious. 2 Chronicles. 16 10. 2 Samuel 16. 3, 4. and 19. 24, 25, 26,
27, 29 Not enduring the reproof of sin. 2 Chronicles. 16. 10. Contentious. Acts 15.
39. Using unlawful guile to do evil, or obtain good. Genesis 20. 2. Genesis 27. 18,
19, 36. Secure. Psalm 32. 1, 2, etc. Unthankful, Isa. 51. 13. Ps. 78. 11.
Censorious. James 3. 1, 2. He may curse or swear. Mat. 26. 75. James 3. 9, 10
Forswear. Mat. 26. 75. Lie. Genesis 20. 2. and 26. 7. Rail and revile. 1 Cor. 5.
11. 1 Pet. 3. 9. and 2. 23. He may also commit, or fall into Idolatry,
Adultery, Fornication, Incest, Murder, Drunkenness, Extortion, Injustice,
Oppression, Dangerous Errors or Heresies. John 1. 46. 2 Samuel 11. 3, 4, 13, 14,
15. 2 Samuel 19. 28, 29, 30. Genesis 19. 30, 31, 32, etc. 1 Kings 11, 7, 8, 9, etc.
1 Cor. 10. 4, 5, 6, 7, etc. 1 Cor. 11. 1. 2, 3, etc. 1 Cor. 15. 12. So now we
find it by sad expirience, That these, and such like evils are to be found too
often stirring in the hearts and lives of the best Christians. And the
differences of their being in the true Christian and the Hypocrite we have
opened in another place.

3 That we do not presently judge a man to be an Hypocrite in his state
because he has some Hypocrisy in him: For there is not a man that lives but
has Hypocrisy in him more or less: Besides that, every man is born an
Hypocrite For of this sin as of all others we have the seeds in our natures.
But no man is to be accounted a Hypocrite in his state but such a one as is
under the reign and power of Hypocrisy, and that yields himself up to it to
obey it, an obstinate and wilful Hypocrite. And not such a one as does see it
in himself, detest, disavow, bewail it, and labor against it all he can, he
is not an Hypocrite albeit he have hypocrisy in him.

4 And therefore in the next place this is especially the conclusion which we
draw from all these things (as I have formerly intimated.) That the more of all
the signs or marks of sincerity are to be found in, or upon any one man, the
more evidence he in whom they are found may have for his sincerity. And the
more of the signs of Hypocrisy are to be found in any one man, the more
cause he in whom the same is found has to suspect himself thereof. The signs
or marks follow.

SECT. I.
In his esteem of God and Christ.

1 It savoureth much of sincerity, and it is very much a sign of a sincere
man, That he do esteem, value, and prefer God and Christ above all, and that
he do in all things seek God and Christ above himself, and above all men and
things. Psalm 24. 6. This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek
thy face, etc. He does greatly love and delight in God and Christ. Ps. 97. 10.
Ye that love the Lord. Ps. 18. 1. I will love thee, O Lord, etc. Io. 21. 15.
Lord thou know that I love thee. Revel. 12. 11, And can, and will leave all
for their sakes. Philip. 7. 8. Mark 10. 28, We have left all and followed thee.
He cares not how little be given to him, so that much be given to God, for
whom he thinks nothing too good, or too much. Psalm 115. 1. Not unto us, O
Lord, not unto us, but to thy Name give glory, etc. So John the Baptist, he
confessed, and denied not, I am not the Christ. He is preferred before me,
whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to unloose, etc. John 1. 19, 20, 27. John
3. 28. He trusts in God. 1 Pet. 3. 5. Holy women that trusted in God, etc. And
he does more fear to offend, and labor to please God than all the world
besides. Exodus 1. 15. 16. But the Midwives feared God, and did not as the King
commanded them. Job 31. 4. 14. 23. Does not he see my ways, etc. What shall I
do when God arises? etc. 1 Kings 18. 3. Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly.
Isaiah 29. 13. 1 Pet. 3. 14. And on the other side it savoureth much of
Hypocrisy, and is very much a sign of an Hypocrite, That a man as he loves
other things more than God and Christ, so in all things he does prefer and
seek himself more than God and Christ, his own interest more than Gods. Hosea
2. 13. She went after her lovers, and forgot me. John 5. 41, 42. I know you,
that ye have not the love of God in you. Phil. 3. 9. Whose belly is their God.
Romans 1. 25. Who changed, etc. and worshipped the creature more than the
crearor, etc. 2 Timothy 3. 4. Lovers of pleasures more than God. He is ready to
assume the glory due to God to himself. Acts 12. 22, 23. And the people gave a
shout saying, the voice of God, etc. And immediately the Angel of the Lord
smote him because he gave not God the glory, And therefore in the forbearing or
doing of good, or evil, he is more moved by his desire to please, and fear to
offend men than God. John. 9. 22. Mat. 14. 5. Luke 20, 19. and 22. 2. John 7.
13. Mark 23. 5. John 12. 42. He does in Gods service think any thing good
enough for God. Mal. 1. 6. 8. O Priests that despise my Name, etc. offer it now
to thy Governor, will he accept it? etc. The love of God is not in him. John
5. 42. He has low and undervaluing thoughts of God and Christ, and the
ordinances and institutions of Christ. Mal. 1. 1, 2, 3, etc. Ye despise my
Name, etc. ye offer polluted bread, etc. Ye say the Table of the Lord is
contemptible, etc. He does more eye the praise and applause, honor and esteem,
favor and good will of men than of God. Mat. 6. 1. to the 12. You do your
alms before men to be seen of them, etc. Gal. 1. 10. Or do I seek to please
men? for if I ^et pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ. John 7.
18. John 8, 50. 1 Samuel 15. 30. I have sinned, yet honor me now I pray thee
before the Elders of my people, etc. He trusts more in other things than in
God, Isa. 30. 2, 3. They cover with a covering, etc. That walk to go into
Egypt. Hosea 7. 14. He gives more respect to the Traditions and Inventions of
men than to the Word and Command of God. Mat. 15. 1, 2, etc. Thus have you made
the commandments of God of none effect by your tradition. Isa. 65. 4. Isa. 29.
30. Mark 7. 3, 4, etc. And to save himself he can be contented to lose Christ.

SECT. II.
In his care of his conversation

2 It is a good proof of a man's sincerity, when there is joined to his
profession of Religion and the light of his understanding in the Word of God a
holy conversation. 2 Cor. 1. 12. For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of
our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, etc. we have had our
conversation in the world, etc. Phil. 3. 20. Our conversation is in heaven,
etc. Psalm 119. 1, 3. They do no iniquity. Psalm 101. 3. I will set no wicked
thing before mine eyes. Phil. 3. 17. Psalm. 26. 1, 6. 2 Samuel 22 24. Tit. 2. 11,
12. And it is a dangerous evidence of Hypocrisy when a man is loose and
careless herein. 1 John 2. 4. He that says I know him, and keeps not his
commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 2 Timothy 3. 1, 2, 6. Men
shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, hoasters, proud, disobedient to
parents, etc. truce breakers, etc. having a form of godliness. Luke 13. 26, 27.
Then shall ye begin to say, we have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou
have taught in our streets. But he shall say, etc. Depart from me all ye
workers of iniquity. Psalm 56. 1, 2. The transgressions of the wicked, etc.
until his iniquity be found hateful. Hosea 7. 8. 14. 16. Romans 15. 17. Amos
5. 10. Isaiah 1. 1, 2. etc. and 48. 1, 2. Tit. 3. 8. Ps. 58. 2.

SECT. III.
In his labor to cleanse his heart.

3 It savours much of sinceretie, and is very much a sign of a sincere
Christian, when a man's main study and labor is to make and keep clean his
heart, and to be indeed as well as to seem to be good within and without, when
he labors to be what he desires to seem to be, and does affect the thing as
well as the name; to be within indeed what he is without in appearance. Psalm
73. 13. Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, etc. Psalm 101. 1, 2. I will
walk within my house with a perfect heart. I will set no wicked thing before
mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside, 2 Timothy 1 3. I serve with
pure conscience, etc 1 Pet. 3. 3, 5. Whose adorning let it not be outward, etc.
but the hidden man of the heart; for so holy women which trusted in God adorned
themselves. Tit. 2. 11, 12. Psalm 51. 10. And on the other side it savours as
much of Hypocrisy, and is very much a sign of an Hypocrite, when the main
study and labor of a man is, to make and keep clean the outside only, and
that he cares not to be, but to seem to be holy, when he takes no care at all
of his thoughts, and such faults as he can commit privately, and conceal from
the world, when he has a care to keep his flesh clean, and suffers his
inward vitals to be corrupt and rotten, Matthew. 23. 14, 25, 27. Ye are like
painted sepulchers, etc. Matthew. 5. 6, 10. that you may appear, etc. Luke 18.
12, 13. Psalm 56. 24. He flattereth himself until, etc. he devises mischief
on his bed, etc. he abhors not evil, etc. In heart ye work wickedness,
you, etc. Acts 8. 13, 20, 21. Repent, etc. For thou art in the gall of
bitterness, etc. Psalm 52. 3. Thou love evil more than good, etc. Hosea 12.
7, 8. John 13. 26, 27. Heb. 12. 15. Acts 7. 51.

SECT. IV.
In his desire and labor after holiness.

4 It savours much of Sincerity, and it is very much a sign of a sincere
Christian, that he loves and desires holiness as much as happiness, and to
live the life, as dye the death of the Righteous. Philip. 3. 11, 12, 13. If by
any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead, etc. Not as though I
had already attained, etc. or were perfect, etc. and reaching forth to the
things before, etc. Luke 17. 5. The Apostles said to the Lord, Increase our
Faith. Mark 9. 24. Lord I believe, help thou mine unbelief. Prove. 22. 12. 2
Cor. 5. 9, 10. And on the other side it savours as much of Hypocrisy, and is
very much a sign of an Hypocrite, when he does not love nor desire holiness at
all, and he does only desire and labor to seem like to godly men, and not to
be godly, when a man shall hate to be reformed. Psalm 50. 16, 17. And shall
love evil more than good. Psalm 52. 3. When a man shall desire only to dye the
death, and not to live the life of the godly. Numb. 23. 10. 27. Matthew 23. 27.
We to you Scribes, etc. for ye are like unto sepulchers, etc. but arewithin full
of dead men's bones, and all uncleannes. Mat. 7. 21, 22, 23. For we take it to
be a certain sign of an Hypocrite, in a man professing Religion to live in the
allowance, and under the any known sin. Mat. 23. 27, 28. Mark 6. 17, 18. Romans
7. 15. Acts 8. 20, 23.

SECT. V.
In his self-opinion as to his own Righteousness.

It savours much of sincerity, and it is very much the sign of a sincere
Christian when a man is apt to look of, and forget the good that is in him, and
has been done by him, and when he is apt to think of, and does look much upon
the evil that is in him, and has been done by him, when a man looking upon
himself, and his own vileness by nature and practice, he is very much
displeased with, and despaires of himself, and looks to the grace of God in
Christ only for Righteousness. He has low thoughts of himself, and of his
own worth and works. Romans 7. 18, 23. 24. In my flesh dwells no good thing. 1 Timothy 1. 15. Sinners of whom I am chief. Psalm 51. 3. my sin is ever before
me. Luke 18. 11. Lord be merciful to me a sinner. Psalm 49. 12. Innumerable
evils have taken hold on me, etc. Phil. 3. 13. I forget the things that are
behind. Ezekiel. 20. 43. And ye shall loath your selves in your own sight for all
your evils that ye have committed. And when he is apt to judge of others
better than himself, and to speak the best of them and their actions, and the
worst of himself and his own actions. He looks upon and accounts the moats
in his own eye as a beam, and the beam that is in another man's eye as a moate.
Mat. 7. 3. But on the other side it savours as much of Hypocrisy, and is very
much the sign of an Hypocrite, when a man's eye is always upon the better, and
not at all upon the worser part of his heart and life, when he can see his
virtues, and not his vices, when he shall brag as the proud Pharisee, Luke 18.
9, 10, 11. I am I am not as other men, etc. or as this Publican, etc. and as in
Isaiah 58. 3. when they said, wherefore have we fasted, and thou see not,
etc. and Isa. 65. 5. Come not near me, I am holier than thou, etc. 1 Samuel 15.
13. And when a man out of a self conceit and opinion of his own excellency
shall trust to himself that he is righteous, and thinks himself better than
others, and despise and censure them that perhaps are better than himself, and
without any cause at all, Luke 18. 9. And he spoke this parable unto certain
men which trusted in themselves that they were righteous. Two men went up into
the Temple, etc. Luke 16. 5. Ye are they which justify your selves, Prove. 20.
6. Most men proclaim their own goodness. Mat. 12. 2, 3, etc. Mat. 23. 30, 31.
etc. Luke 7. 39. and 5. 30. John 7. 48, 49.

SECT. VI.
In the agreement between his sayings and doings.

6 It is an universal and infallible sign of sincerity when a man's practice
suits with his profession of the true Religion, that a man is a doer as well as
a hearer and speaker of the Word of God, Romans 6. 7. ye have obeyed from the
heart that form of doctrine. Genesis 26. 5. Because Abraham obeyed my voice, and
kept my charge, etc. 1 Timothy 2. 10. But which becomes women professing
godliness with good works. Acts 2. 41, 42. Job 31. throughout: And on the other
side it is a bad sign, and savoureth much of Hypocrisy for a man to be a great
talker, but a little doer of good, a great hearer but a little doer of the
Word, he makes a great flourish, and fair protestations of his goodness, but
has none, he is nothing but leaves and shows, Mat. 23. 3. They say and do
not, Ezekiel. 33. 31. they hear thy words but will not do them. Luke 6. 46. Why
call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things I say? Mat. 21. 30. And he
answered and said, I go Sir, and went not.

SECT. VII.
In the extent of his obedience.

7 It savours much of Sincerity, and is a very good sign of a true Christian,
when a man is universal and uniform in his obedience, he is for all good
commanded, and against all evil forbidden. He is careful to avoid all sins,
and perform all duties: And most of all careful to perform the more weighty
duties: he does not pick and choose what will stand with his lusts, but does
all, be it never so cross to him, as knowing, that not to do all, is to do
nothing at all to the purpose. James 2. 10, 11. For whosoever shall keep the
whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. And this he
does in all places, times, company, and cases, as having God in his eye, and
seeing himself to be before God in all that he does* Luke 1. 6. walked in all
the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord. Job 1. 8. fears God, and
escheweth evil. Psalm 101. 1, 2. I will set no wicked thing, etc. Psalm 119 2,
3. But on the other side it savours much of Hypocrisy, and is very much a
sign of his Hypocrisy in a man, when he is partial, or local, or temporal in
his obedience; when he does only forbear some evils, and do some duties; or
he is for lesser, and not for greater duties; or he does all but at some times,
and in some places, cases, and in some company, and he is changeable and
unconstant, where he is all for public, and not at all for private duties;
where he is better abroad than at home, and ^n time of prosperity than in time
of adversi^tie, Mat. 23. 23. Ye have omitted the weighties matters of the Law,
Judgment, etc. these ought ye to have dune, and not to have left the other
undone, etc. Mark 7. 4. Mat. 27. 6, 7, etc. And such was the obedience of Saul,
Jehu, Herod, and others, noted for Hypocrisy in Scripture. Mat. 15. 2, 3, etc.
Job. 27. 10. Will he always call upon God? 2 Chronicles. 25. 9, 10, 16. 2 Chronicles.
24. 2.

SECT. VIII.
In his impositions upon others consciences.

8 It is a good sign of Sincerity to be tender and merciful, as to impositions
upon the consciences of others, but rather to be severe against a man's self.
A sincere Christian can spare others in that wherein he will not spare
himself. He dares not to impose hard things upon the conscience of others, and
such as he is not willing to bear himself. Acts 15. 28. And it savours much of
hypocrisy, and is very much a sign of an hypocrite, where a man is severe and
rigid to press and impose hard burdens, either such as God imposes otherwise
than God imposes them: or Impositions of men that God never imposed; when a
man shall rigorously in his reproofs inveigh against other men's sins, make
every moa^e a beam, and pres^ duties much upon others, whereof he will not bear
any part himself: he is very partial and favorable to himself, his beam shall
be but a moate, and he can indulge and spare himself in the neglect, or
careless performance of duties. Matthew. 23. 4. Luke 11. 46. You bind heavy
burdens, etc,

SECT. IX
In his acceptance of Reproof of his sin.

9 It savours much of Sincerity, and is very much a sign of a sincere
Christian, where a man is very glad to see his sins, and to be reproved for his
sins, and can love the Reprover, he can like of a close Reproof, and that
faithful Ministry, which he is at present under, and when being showed his
sin, he is very ready to confess and forsake it. John 3. 21. He that does
truth, comes to the light. Psalm 141. 5. Let the righteous smite me, 2 Cor. 7.
11. 2 Samuel 12. 7, 8, 13. Job 31. 33. But on the other side it savours as much
of Hypocrisy, and is as much a sign of an Hypocrite, when a man cannot endure
to be faithfully dealt with in this thing, and to have his his sin detected;
and labors by all means to hide and retain it: either he does cloak it,
mince it, shift it, justify, or excuse it, or impudently deny it, and hates
the reprover of him for it. He cannot endure the faithful Ministry he is
under for the present. Matthew. 23. 30. And say if we had been in the days of
our Fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
Prophets. So Herod for this distasted John the Baptist, and took away his
life, as may appear by Mark 6. 17, 18, 19, 20. compared with 14, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, etc. 1 Kings 22 8. There is another, etc. But I hate him, etc. Amos 5. 10.
They hate him that rebukes, etc. They abborre him that speaks uprightly,
Mal. 1. 6. And ye say wherein have we despised thy name? Prove. 28. 13. 2 Cor.
7. 11.

SECT. X.
In his esteem of true Christians.

10 It is a good sign of Sincerity in a Christian Professor, that he does
love them that appear to be true Christians, because they are such, and that he
does show his love to them by word and deed, and amongst the rest of the
manifestations thereof does show it by delight in their company, 2 Cor. 6. 4.
6. In all things approving our selves as the Ministers of GOD, etc. By love
unfeigned, 1 John 3. 14. We know that we have passed from death to life,
because we love the brethren. He that loves not his Brother abides in death.
Psalm 26. 1, 4, 5. I have not sat with vain persons, etc. 1 John 2. 10. He
that loves his brother abides in light. Psalm 119. 63. In whom is all my
delight. And on the side it is a very shrewd sign of Hypocrisy to hate them
that appear to be sincere Christians, to look upon them as signs and wonders,
Isa. 8. 18. to deal hardly with them, to decline their company, and to keep
the company of suspected Hypocrites, Isa. 66. 5. Your brethren that hated you,
that cast you out for my names sake, etc. John 17. 14. The world has hated
them, etc. 1 John 3. 14. He that loves not his brother abides in death. 2 Chronicles. 18. 7 But I hate him. 1 John 3. 10. In this the children of God are
manifest, and the children of the devil, whosoever loves not righteousness is
not of God, neither he that loves not his brother. Mat. 23. 33. Psalm. 69. 9.
Cant. 1. 5, 7, James 3. 17.

SECT. XI.
In his desire after perfection of Grace.

11 It savou^s much of Sincerity, and is much a sign of a sincere Christian in
a man, that he still finds fault with himself for his defect in Grace and
duty: he never thinks he has grace enough, and he mourns under his weakness
therein, and want thereof; and finds dislike in his own performances, albeit
he do his best therein, does always hunger and thirst after, and labor for
more grace, and for perfection herein. But he does provoke others to go beyond
him, and is glad that others do God better service than himself. Phil. 3. 14,
15, etc. I press forward, etc. Mat. 5. 6. they that hunger and thirst after
righteousness. Romans 7. 24, 25. O wretched man who shall deliver me, etc. Psalm
84. 2. 7. My soul longs, etc. for the Courts of the Lord, etc. they go from
strength, etc. 2 Cor. 7. 1. And it savours as much of hypocrisy to set a stint
to a man^ self in his grace and obedience, and to think he has enough, and
to care or labor for no more: when he thinks he is, and does good enough,
and does not care to be better than he and to do more than he does: And to
think every man else must keep his pace, and that he that goes not so far,
goes not far enough. And that he that goes farther and faster, goes too
fast, and too far, Rev. 3. 17. Because thou say I am rich, etc. and have
need of nothing, etc. Psalm 36. 3. He has left off to be wise, and to do
good: Luke 6. 25. Woe unto you that are full, etc. and 18. 12, 13. and 1. 53.

SECT. XII
In his affection to the Word.

12 It savoureth much of sincerity to have a great love to, and constant
delight in the Word of God. Ps. 119. 20. 97. O how I love thy Laws, etc. My
foul breaks for the longing it has to thy Judgments at all times. Job 23.
12. I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. 1. Pet.
2. 2. As new born babes desire the sincere milk of the Word, etc. Romans 7. 22. I
delight in the Law of God as to the inward man. And it savours of hypocrisy to
hate the Word. John 3. 20* For every one that does evil hates the light, etc.
or faignedly or slightly, or for a time only to love it. Ezekiel. 33. 31. And
they heard thy words, but will not do them; for with their mouths they show
much love, etc. Isa. 58. 2. yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my
ways, etc. Luke 8. 12, 13, 14.

SECT. XIII.
In the frame of his Spirit as to greatness of place.

13 It savoureth much of Sincerity that a man is of an humble spirit, that he
thinks every man better than himself, and himself the worst of the company
where ever he comes: not having, he does not affect nor seek titles of honor,
and having he does not value them, he cares not for precedence or superiority,
but can, and does prefer others (perhaps beneath himself in place and parts
before him. Psalm. 131. 2. I am as a weaned child. 1 Timothy 1. 15. Sinners of
whom I am the chief. Mat. 18. 3. Except ye be converted and become as little
children, etc. Job 31. 14, 15. Romans 12. 10. And it savours of Hypocrisy in
professors, ambitiously to desire and seek greatness of place or title,
precedencie or superiority, to think a man's self to be the best of the company
wherever he goes, and to exalt a man's self over others. Mat. 23. 5, 6. 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12. They love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in
the Synagogues, etc. and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi, etc. Whosoever
shall exalt himself shall be abased. Luke 18. 11. The Pharisee, etc. 3 John v.
9. Diotrephes who loves to have pre-eminence, etc. James 3. 1. Be not many
Masters, etc.

SECT. XIV.
In his striving against beloved sins.

14 It is a great sign of sincerity in a man where he sets himself with all his
might, and most of all against spiritual and heart sins, and inward lusts, and
amongst them against his most intimate and beloved sins, that serve most to
answer his worldly ends; when he looks on sin as a Toad, and keeps it as far
from his bosom as he can. So David, Psalm 18. 22. I was also upright, etc. and
kept me from mine iniquity. Job 31. 1, etc. I have made a covenant with mine
eyes, etc. Psalm 19. 12. Cleanse me from secret faults. And a great sign of
Hypocrisy in a man, when he shall by all means labor to keep, conceal, and
retain such sins. Job 20. 12, 13. Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, and
he hide it under his tongue, etc. Mat. 23. 25. compared with Luke 16. 14. the
Pharisees were covetous, and full of covetousness, and this they did maintain by
all the means they might, Mat. 23. 14.

SECT. XV.
In his care of private duties.

15 It savoureth much of sincerity in a man when he chooses to be most
careful of secret, and spiritual duties and performances, as secret prayer,
meditation, self-examination, and the like, But thou when thou prayest enter
into thy closet, etc. Acts 10. 9. Peter went up upon the house to pray, etc.
Genesis 24. 63. Isaac went out into the field to meditate etc. Ps. 119. 59. I
thought on my ways, etc. And it savoureth as much of hypocrisy when a man is
very zealous of public or outward, but very careless of private and spiritual
duties and observances. Mat. 23. 5. But all their works they do to be seen of
men. Mat. 6. 1, 2, 5. They love to pray standing in the sinagogues, etc. Take
heed ye do not your alms before men, etc. to be seen, etc.

SECT. XVI.
In the motives and ends of their Actings.

16 It savoureth much of Sincerity, and is very much a sign of a sincere man,
when the motives and ends of all his actings are pure and heavenly, when he
does all that he does out of a pure heart, from the love and fear of God, and
principally and chiefly for the works sake, to the end to please and glorify
God, and not for any corrupt end to himself, and therefore he cares not to
be seen of men in what he does. But it is a vehement cause of suspicion in a
man, when he is not moved at all by such motives, nor aims at such ends, but
his motives and ends are corrupt, when he does what he does alone or chiefly
for selfe-ends, selfe-praise, honor, or other advantage, when he does
ambitiously or vain-gloriously seek the setting up of himself more than God
therein. Mat. 23. 14. ye make long prayers, and under color thereof devour
widows houses. Mat. 23. 5. All their works they do to be seen of men.

SECT. XVII.
In his jealousy over himself.

17 It is a very good sign of Sincerity in a man when he is ever doubtful and
fearful of himself, in the general, and especially in the point of
Sincerity, and when he is often trying and searching of himself, and does all
that he can to know himself, and is therefore willing to be discovered, and
reproved by others; glad to have himself and his work brought to the light.
Psalm 26. 2. I have walked in mine integrity, etc. Ioh. 3. 21. He that does
truth comes to the light, etc. Psalm 26. 2. and 139. 23. Search me, etc. Job
31. 6. Psalm 119. 50. And it is a dangerous sign of Hypocrisy in a man when
he is confident of, and secure in himself herein, when he never suspects
himself, nor will he endure to be suspected, or to put himself, or to be put by
others upon the trial herein. John 3. 20. Every one that does evil hates the
light, etc.

SECT. XVIII.
In the order of his observance of Gods Commands.

18 It savoureth much of sincerity, that a man is orderly in his obedience to
Gods commands, and that he do it in a due manner; that he does prefer the
greater before the lesser, the first Table before the second, etc. Fundamentals
in Faith and Practice, and things absolutely necessary to salvation before
lesser things; substantial before circumstantial things. And it savours of
Hypocrisy where a man is preposterous herein, Mat. 23. 23. You tithe Mint and
Annis, and have omitted the weightier matters, etc.

If yet you would see further the signs of such things as accompany sincerity
you shall have them in the next place.

CHAP. IX.
The signs of some other things that do always go along with, or are
necessary to make up sincerity.

WE are now come to the last sort of signs which are the signs of such things
as do accompany, or are constitutive of sincerity; and without which there
cannot be sincerity in the heart. Such are Christ's indwelling in our hearts by
his spirit; by means whereof we are made partakers of sincerity; for there is
none in us but what flows, and is fetched out of this fountain of grace and
truth, and Regeneration, the first work of Christ's Spirit, which necessarily
implies Faith and Love.

We have already laid down the principal signs of Faith and Love. It remains
only tha^ we give you the principal signs or effects of our union with Christ,
and the indwelling of his Spirit in us, which are both at once: For he that is
one with Christ, is one in whom Christ dwells, and has Christ in him by
faith through the spirit. 1 John 4. 15. And to have Christ in us, and his
Spirit dwelling in us, is all one, or at least go always together, and are
never apart. The signs of the Spirit will be signs of this union. 1 John 4. 13.
By this we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, that he has given to us of
his Spirit. Ephesians. 3. 17. That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith. Romans 8.
9, 10, 11. But ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit, if the Spirit of God
dwell in you. Phil. 2. 1. These signs of the indwelling of Christ by his Spirit,
and of Regeneration, we shall give you, with relation both to the external
conversion of those sincere Christians in whom Christ is, and who are truly
born again, as also to the inward frame of their hearts.

SECT. I.
Signs of our union with Christ, and of his Spirit dwelling in us.

Our being in Christ, and his Spirit abiding in us, may be known by such like
signs as these.

1 By the death of sin, and life of grace in us, by holiness in heart and life,
opinion and practice, Romans 8. 9, 10, 11. Ye are not in the flesh, etc. if so be
that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of
Christ he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of
sin. But the Spirit is life because of Righteousness. But if the Spirit of him
that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from
the dead shall quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you
Gal. 5. 24. 1 John 3. 6. Whosoever abides in him sins not. Whosoever
sins, has not seen him, nor known him. Ephesians. 2. 21, 22. 1 Pet. 1. 2. Jude
v. 19.

2 By the fruits of the Spirit. The tree is known by his fruit. Mat. 12. 33.
The fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness,
Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance, etc. Gal. 5. 5. 22. Ephesians. 5. 9.

3 By our Regeneration, he that is in Christ is a new creature, has a new
soul, and does manifest it by a new life. 2 Cor. 5. 17. He that is in Christ is
a new creature. Gal. 6. 15. For in Christ Jesus neirher Circumcision avails
any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

4 By the spirit of Prayer (an essential part of the work of Grace) he that is
in Christ has this in him, Gal. 4. 6. And because ye are sons God has sent
the Spirit of his Son, crying Abba father, Ephesians. 2. 18. Zach. 12. 10. Rom 8. 15.

5 By a rooted and grounded love to God and his people. Ephesians. 3. 16, 17, 18.
That he would grant to you according to the riches of his glory to be
strengthened with might by his Spirit in the Inner man, that Christ may dwell in
your hearts by Faith, that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able,
etc. 1 John 4. 12. If we love one another God dwells in us.

6 By having of the same mind in us as was in Jesus Christ. Phil. 2. 5. Let
this mind be in you, which also was in Christ Jesus. and 3. 9. I account all
things but loss that I may win Christ that I may know him, etc. and the
fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death, etc. 1
Pet. 4. 1.

7 By a walking and living after the example of Christ. 1 John 2. 5, 6. Hereby
we know that we are in him. He that says he abides in him, ought himself
also to walk as he walked.

8 By a care to keep the Commandments of God and Christ. 1 Ioh 3. 24. And he
that keeps his Co^mandments dwells in him, and he in him. And hereby we
know he abides in us by the Spirit he has given us.

9 By growth and increase in grace. Ephesians. 4. 15. That we henceforth be no more
children. etc. But speaking the truth, etc. may grow up into him in all thines
which is the head, even Christ. Ephesians. 2. 21. 2 These. 1. 3. Your faith grows
exceedingly, etc.

SECT. II.
The signs of our Regeneration may be these.

1 An understanding heart to know God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent. 1
John 5. 18, 20. And we know that whosoever is born of God, etc. And we know
that the Son of God is come, and has given us understanding that we may know
him that is true, etc. Joh. 5. 24. John 17. 3.

2 Faith in Christ. 1 John 5. 1. Whosoever believes that Jesus is the Christ,
is born of God. John 1. 12.

3 Holiness and Righteousness of life without, and purity of heart within. 1
John 2. 29. Every one that does righteousness is born of him. 1 John 3. 9, 10.
Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin, for his seed remains in him,
and he cannot sin because he is born of God. Whosoever does not righteousness
is not of God. 1 John 3. 3. He that has this hope purifieth himself as he is
pure. 1 John 5. 18, 20.

4 Love of God; it is as natural for the new born children of God to love God,
as for children to love their parents. John 1. 12, 13.

5 Love to the godly: 2 John 4. 7. Every one that loves is born of God, and
knows God. 1 John 3. 9, 10. Whosoever does not righteousness is not of God,
neither he that loves not his brother. 2 Cor. 6. 6. 1 John 2. 10.

6 Victory over the world. 1 John 5. 4. Whosoever is born of GOD overcomes the
world.

7 A strong love to, and desire after the Word of God, and a conformity of
heart and life to it. Psalm 119. 97. Oh how I love thy Law, etc. I have
esteemed the words of his mouth better than my necessary food. Job 23. 12. Luke
8. 15. 1 Pet. 2. 3.

SECT. III
The sum of all this Head.

Now of all that we have spoken as to this point in hand, and head of trial,
this is then the sum; That a man may enjoy all outward Gospel Privileges,
such as the manifestations of Gods presence, etc. all Gospel Ordinances, and
means of Grace, as Word, Sacraments, Sabbaths, all advantages imaginable, by
parents, education, society, etc. Have great gifts and parts, and do much with
them, as Preach, Pray, and the like: That he may in appearance be converted
from the world, be changed in his outward conversation, cast off all his
outward pollutions, be so much reformed that he may appear unblameable in the
sight of men, have much light from the Word of God, be clearly convinced of
the truth of it, have such a taste of persuasion, that the good thereby
promised and offered does belong to him as thereby to be drawn to come to
Christ in an open profession, and some inward affections close with his Church,
be a Churchmember, be taken of others, and take himself to be a true
member', seemingly own Jesus Christ for his Lord, and submit to his Law, live
orderly with Christians in Church Fellowship, and there make a glorious
profession of the Gospel, proceed to have many singular gifts and seeming
graces, do many excellent things, and so live and dye, yea live and dye a
Martyr in the defense of the Gospel he professes; yea he may have such a
discovery of the Grace of God in Christ by the Gospel, and such a seeming work
of Faith and Love in his soul, as that he may be persuaded that Christ and
Heaven is his. And upon this have a little love or show of love to God and his
people, and live in a kind of hope, joy, and expectation of Heaven to his
dying day; and yet be in his corrupt and unregenerate estate and perish. And
that he only that is regenerate, renewed by the Holy Ghost and Word of God in
his nature to be like Christ shall be reputed sincere, and so saved at last.
But to give a shorter account hereof, let the sum of all be this: That the
most certain and infallible character of the true and living Christian, and
one that is a Christian indeed. John 1. 47. And that whereby he may be best
known, and distinguished from the counterfeit and painted Christian the
Hypocrite, is, by that which is within him, where the Kingdom of God is. Luke
17. 20, 21. He is the sincere Christian that is so inwardly. Romans 2. 29. And
in him these things following are to be found. The Spirit of God and Christ is
given unto him. 1 John 3. 24. 1 John 4. 3. Romans 8. 10, 11, 15. Galat. 4. 6.
Romans 8. 9. 1 Cor. 2, 12. 1 John 4. 13. And according to the new Covenant.
Isaiah 44, 3. and 32. 15. Ezekiel 39. 29. Joel 2. 29. Zachar. 12. 10. compared
with Acts 2. 17. This spirit he receives in the Preaching of the Gospel.
Galat. 3. 2. By this spirit in the Gospel he is convinced of his own desperate
and helpless case out of Christ, and that his help is in Christ alone. John
26. 8. And thereupon is drawn to Christ whom he does embrace by Faith. John
6. 44. Hebrews 11 13. Philip. 3. 12. Ephesians. 3. 16, 17. John 6. 56. 2 Corinthians.
4. 13. This Spirit and GOD the Father in it abides and dwells in him, 1 Corinthians. 3. 24. 1 John 4. 13. John 6. 56. Ephesians. 2. 22. And he in whom this
Spirit is abides and dwells in GOD. 1 Corinthians 3. 24. 1 John 4. 13. John 6.
56. By this Holy Spirit Christ and the soul are firmly united together, and
do become even as Husband and Wife. Romans 7. 4. Canticles 1, 2, etc. and are
so joined as the Tree and Branches. John 15. 1, etc. Head and Body, 1 Cor. 11.
3. Ephesians. 5. 23. Body and Soul, Ephesians. 2. 5. Hence follows presently a very
great and an universal change of the soul within, appearing in the life
without. The change is from darkness to light, from bondage to liberty, from
sin to grace, from death to life, etc. and is called Regeneration, by which
here is produced a new creature (the soul whereof is this Spirit of God abiding
in him) compared to the natural generation, conception and birth, John 3. 6.
John 12. 13. 1 Pet. 1. 22. Tit. 3. 5. Galat. 4. 19. 2 Cor. 5. 17. Galat. 5. 15.
This Spirit of God being as the soul in the body in this new creature, does
animate it, Ephesians. 2. 5, 6. Romans 8. 11. And by it the old man is changed into a
new man; there is a new nature, he partakes of the divine nature. 2 Pet. 1. 4.
a new life. Gal. 2. 20. Col. 3. 21. 1 John 5. 12. This change is from the state
of nature to the state of grace; from the likeness of the old, to the likeness
of the new Adam, he has now in him the mind of Christ, Ephesians. 4. 24. Phil. 2.
5. 1 Cor. 15. 46, 47. Phil. 3. 9. He now lives the life of Christ, 1 Pet. 4.
6. 1 John 2. 5, 6. 1 John 3. 24. and according to the Gospel of Christ. 2 Cor.
3. 18. The Holy Spirit thus dwelling, and animating in, and acting of this new
creature, and being in it self a spirit of light, life, and grace, Zach. 12.
10. Romans 1. 4. 1 Pet. 1. 4. It governs him in whom it is, and he is led by it,
and walks after it according to the Word of God. 1 Pet. 1. 22. 2 Cor. 3. 18.
And as the lively pure spring does work out the mire and mudde out of it self,
so this spirit does work out of the heart the ignorance and corruption thereof,
and make, and keep it pure, Acts 15. 9. It kills sin. Romans 8. 10, 13.
Destroys the works of the Devil and Flesh. 1 John 3. 8. Such as are
Adultery, Uncleanness, Lasciviousness, Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred,
Variance, Emulation, Wrath, Strife, Sedition, Heresies, Envyings, Murder,
Drunkenness, and such like. Gal. 5. 17. And quickneth, inclines, and disposes
the whole heart, and consequently the whole man to grace and goodness. Romans 8.
10. And such like fruits as these following, Righteousness, Joy, Love, Long
suffering, Gentleness, Faith, Goodness, Meekness, Temperance and the like.
Gal. 5. 19. Romans 14. 17. and the manifestation and exercise thereof in the
life, are the natural and proper works, fruits, and effects of this spirit.
Gal. 5. 22, 23. Romans 14. 17. 2 Cor. 5. 13. Romans 8. 26. 2 Cor. 8. 17. Acts 2. 4.
Gal. 4. 6. And he in whom these things are found is certainly a sincere
Christian, and an adopted child of God. All this seems to be put together in
the words of our Savior Christ. John 1. 12, 13. But as many as received him]
that is, by faith and obedience as the true Messiah: to them gave he power]
that is, the dignity, right, or privilege to become the Sons of God] 1 John 3.
1 Gal. 4. 6. which were born] that is born again, as John 3. not of blood, nor
of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man] not in a natural course and
way wherein men have children in their own likeness, Genesis 5. 3. But of God] and
according to his own likeness, Genesis 1. 26. and 5. 1. But the Hypocrite being
still in his natural estate (let his place and gifts be otherwise what they
will] understands none of these things. 1 Cor. 2. 11, 14. and is a stranger
to them. John 3. 1, 4, 8, 9. Nor can any man know these things but he that
receives them. Rev. 2. 17. So that now by comparing of a man's heart and life
to the Word of God in the particulars before laid down, a man may know as much
of his own, as touching his Sincerity in his profession of Religion as can be
known. And by co^paring another man's life to the Word of God, a man may know as
much as touching his Sincerity in his Profession, as can be known by another
man.

SECT. IV.
Some Objections, and Answers to them.

Objest. If it be said some are sanctified from the womb, and some are changed
insensibly.

Answ. We answer: They are changed from the state of natural men, whose state
is to be seen in the glass of the Word, and by their contrariety to natural
men that are in the world being opposite to them. So that by a careful
comparing of these things together, a man may see much herein.

But out of all this an objection may be made thus.

Object. If there go so much to the making up of a true Christian, and that in
his heart there be such a work of Grace as we have showed, and no less than
this will speak him sincere, who then shall be saved?

Answ. To this we do answer.

1 That we know there is some Hypocrisy, more or less in the best Christian
under heaven; for we are not perfect here. And therefore when we press
Sincerity, and a necessity of it, we mean not such a sincerity that is so
perfect and complete that it has no deceit or falsehood joined with it. But as
other graces are but in part, we know but in part, we love but in part, so
likewise we are sincere but in part. So David, a man after GOD's own heart, yet
cries out, who can understand his errors? Ps. ^9. 12. Yea there is more
Hypocrisy and self, ends in the best than he can perceive. So much is
discovered even to the best man as to make him humble* and to trust in Christ
only, and to make him cry out with David, Ps. 51. 6. for truth in the inward
parts.

2 As we do not judge of a man's integrity by one act, and call him a sincere
man that does some things in a natural uprightness of heart, as Abimelech. Genesis
20. 5. and as some think of Vriah, whom the Prophet Isaiah calls a faithful
witness, that he was the same gross Idolater named 2 Kings 16. 10. Is. 8. 2.
So do we not judge a man an Hypocrite by any particular act or carriage at one
time, but by the constant course of his life, his constant walking and way. And
so the godly man is said to walk in his uprightness. Prove 14. 2.

3 We have said that the best Christian has a time of Infancy and tender age,
when he is but weak, and his strength small.

4 We do not understand or intend that there is, or of necessity must be
such a lively and constant acting of grace by every sincere Christian at all
times, and such manifestations thereof by the signs and characters, we have
before given, so as there shall be no ebb, stop, or interruption therein. We
know the state of a Christian here is a warfare between the flesh and the
spirit, typed out by the house of David and Saul: And that it is in this in the
soul as it is in the body, it has its distempers; it is sometimes sick, weak,
and faint, and sometimes it seems to be dead for many days, and yet alive. The
true Christian may grow lukewarm, perhaps cold for a time: there are times of
temptation with him, that as in the winter there does outwardly appear no
difference between a dead tree and a living tree, both are without fruit and
leaves, so between a true and counterfeit Christian. But in the worst time
somewhat more or less will appear of what we have observed herein.

SECT. V.
Quest. But then it may be asked, what (at the least) is required of the true
Christian, and yet is to be found in the lowest, least, and weakest state of
true Grace?

Answ. For answer to this we are to know, That as there is a strong, so a weak
Christian. Romans 15. 1. and there are little children as well as young men and
fathers in Christianity. 1 John 2. 13. so amongst them that are weak there are
two sorts, or Christians are weak in two cases, or under two considerations.

1 Such as are now weak by accident but have been stronger at other times, and
so the strongest Christian may become weak as a man that is strong in his
natural strength of his body may by sickness, fasting, or the like be brought
to be so weak that a child may push him down, or he may be ready to fall of
himself. And as the natural body by a distemper, from a disease, a blow on the
head, or some other accident may lie a while for dead, so it is with the
spiritual body of the new man, and with his spiritual strength. It may be by
some extraordinary pressures and burdens of affliction, or temptation (for the
present) brought to a very low and weak estate, and perhaps into a kind of
swound, to have in appearance very little or no sign of life left, but to be
as it were stark dead. But there are another sort of weak Christians, and
they are such as were never stronger. And such are (for the most part) all
Christians at their first coming into Christ, they are rude, and raw, and have
but little faith; such were Christ's disciples, Mat. 17. 17. Luke 9. 41. Matthew.
6. 30. and 8. 26. and 16. 8. Mark 9 19, 24. Nathaniel, John 1. 45, 46, 20, 27.
and others, 1 Cor. 9. 22. And yet it is so possibly with some (as it seems it
was with Paul) that they have very much of the Spirit given them, and they are
very strong Christians at the first. But for the most, even of true Christians,
they are weak and childish in the things of God a while after the first
conversion; and some of them may happily continue so for a long time, as some
children as to their natural strength do by some distemper continue weak, and
grow but a little for a long while: Yea possibly it may be so in the first
conversion of a sinner to God, that as the seed of Corn that is cast into the
earth dies, and lies long before it arises, yet having a seed of life in it,
it does at length arise and grow. 1 Cor. 16. 36, 37. and come to perfection. So
little of spiritual life, or the life of the new creature may appear for a long
time in that soul which may notwithstanding be quickened and truly alive to God
in Christ. We shall say a word to both of these kinds of weakness, and weak
Christians; touching whom we say, That ordinarily in the weakest of true
Christians of this second sort, and in the lowest and weakest estate of
Christianity, considered apart, and free from violent temptations, assaults and
oppositions, these things are always seen, and are necessarily required in
every true Christian.

1 The weakest Christian must be in Christ by Faith and a new creature. As one
cannot be said to be of the nature of man, or of mankind till that he be
born and brought forth of the womb of his mother, So neither can one be, or
be said to be a true Christian till he be born again, and Christ be formed in
him. John 1. 12. But to as many as received him, to them gave he power to be
the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name, which were born, etc.
2 Cor. 5. 17. If any man be in Christ he is a new creature.

2 He must by this means be spiritually alive, and risen from the death of sin,
Ephesians. 2. 1. You that were dead has he quickened. Gal. 2. 20. Christ lives in
me, and the life I now live, etc.

3 He is then of the same nature, and therefore must be more or less like unto
the strongest Christian, as children to men, lambs to sheep, and the most
tender branches to the great bows of tree. So the weakest Christian
notwithstanding his weakness, is partaker of the divine nature of God in
Christ, 2 Pet. 1. 4. Whoreby are given us exceeding great and precious
promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature.

4 He must have of the light of the saving knowledge of God. Ephesians. 5. 4, 8.
Ye were darkness, but now are ye light, etc. Isa. 52. 2. my people shall know
my name. Heb. 8. 11. They shall know the Lord. 1 John 2. 13, 19, 20, 27. Mat.
13. 11.

5 He has a tender care to please, and fear to offend God. Isa. 66. 2. I will
look to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and trembles at my word,
etc. 1 John 3. 23. 2 Kings 22. 3, 10, 12, 19.

6 He is very sensible of his own weakness, Mat. 9. 23, 24. And straightway he
cried out with tears Lord I believe help thou my unbelief. Luke 11. 1. Lord
teach us to pray, etc.

7 He has a Spirit of prayer and can more or less open his case to God
thereby. Gal. 4. 6. And because ye are sons God has sent the Spirit of his
Son into your he arts, crying Abba Father. Romans 8. 15.

8 He is from the sight and sense of his own weakness poor in spirit, and
moved to look toward Christ, and to hunger and thirst after him. Mat. 5. 3, 4.

9 He desires strength, and therefore loves and plyeth all the means of Grace
(especially the Word of God) whereby he may be strengthened, he makes after
Christ in and by his own Ordinances. Mat. 9. 23, 24. Luke 11. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 2.
as new born babes desire the sincere milk of the Word, etc. Luke 17. 5. The
Apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith, John 45, 46, 47.

10 He will not be taken off this way but will follow Christ always. Joh. 6.
67, 68. Will ye also go away? Then Peter answered, Lord to whom shall we go?
thou have the words of eternal life. John 10. 27.

11 He does commonly grow and increase in strength, as children, trees, and
herbs. Mal. 4. 2. Ye shall go forth and grow as the calves of the stall. Ephesians.
4. 15.

12 He does not purpose, nor does he make it his trade to sin. 1 John 3. 8, 9.
He that commits sin is of the devil, etc. Whosoever is born of God does not
commit sin, for his seed remains in him, etc. (that is) he cannot so sin as
to purpose it, and make it his trade as wicked men do.

13 He has a love to all the children of God, and true Christians as
Christians. 1 John 5. 1. Whosoever believes that Jesus, etc. is born of God.
And every one that loves him that begat, loves him also that is begotten of
him. 1 John 4. 7. Every one that loves is born of God, v. 8. He that loves
not knows not God. 1 John 3. 14. He that loves not his brother abides in
death. Mat. 25. 42.

14 He has the use of his spiritual senses in some degree at one time or
other; as Sight, Hearing, etc. He sees somewhat of God and Christ, sin, and
wrath, grace and glory. And gives ear to the things that are spoken thereof,
and has some relish and savor, sense and feeling, and can speak something
sensibly thereof; and has some breathings and stirrings of good desires and
wishes after Christ, some power and motion to do good. And he that can find
these things really and in truth in any degree in him may conclude of himself
that though he be but a weak, yet he is a child of God, and a sincere
Christian. And that his sins are forgiven for his Name fake. 1 John 2. 12.
And he shall never be moved. Psalm 15. 5. And herein also we are to know, That
these signs and symptoms are not in all, nor in the same person at all times
alike clear and visible to others, or to the party himself in whom they are;
but they ebb and flow occasionally and have their degrees, stops and changes.
It is sometimes with the spiritual man as it is with the natural man, and his
natural strength: the same may be by some accident or distemper very much
decayed and impaired, and the man though otherwise a strong man grow very weak,
and seem to be dying. So it is in this case, a sincere Christian (sometime
strong) may by a relapse into sin, or some grievous pressure of affliction
inward or outward, or both, grow for a time very weak in grace, his pulse beat
weak, and his breath short, as if he were near dying, yea sometimes (though
very rarely) it falls out so, that all the motions, exercises and operations of
Grace in the true Christian, may be for a while so much suspended, that they
may seem (in appearance) to be totally extinct. So that as in the natural body
it falls out sometimes by some accident or distemper, all the motions and
symptoms of life, as sight, hearing, breathing, and the like seems to be
stopped, and nothing of the natural life appears. So it is in this spiritual
body, little or nothing of spiritual life may appear (-for the present) in
it, and yet it may be alive. And ordinarily where this spiritual life is, it
does appear more or less, by all, or some of the signs and manifestations
thereof we have before laid down. See for these things Psalm. 88. 1, 2. etc. v.
16, 17. Ps. 51. 9, 10, 11. Ps. 77. 1, 2, 7. Ps. 38. 1, 2, 5, 6. Job 1, 2, etc.
and 30. 15, 16, 17.

We have done with the trial of persons, and have dispatched the differences we
have thought upon to be between the sincere Christian and Hypocrite in their
inside and outside apart, and in their inside and outside together. And now it
remains we say a word as to the trial of their works and services, and to lay
down what is requisite to the making of a work good.

CHAP. X.
The trial of the sincerity of works. And what is requisite to make a work
good.

ANd now from the trial of the sincerity of Persons and hearts we come to the
trial of the sincerity of Works and Services. And for this we are to know,
That there are many things required, whereunto the sincere Christian has
respect, for the making of a service and work good, or a suffering acceptable.
There is some thing repuired in the person doing or suffering. And some things
there are required in the thing to be done and suffered. 1 In the person doing
or suffering it is requisite, that he be rightly qualified. 2 In the thing to
be done or suffered. 1 It is requisite it be done by a right rule or warrant. 2
In a right manner. 3 And to right ends. For the qualification of the person
doing or suffering, it is requisite that he be in Christ by faith, and so one
with him, and thereby become a new creature, a child of God. John 1. 12, 13.
and so accepted in his person, for otherwise his work cannot be accepted. For
God must first have respect to him, ere he will have respect to his offering or
service. Dent. 33. 10, 11. They shall teach Jacob, etc and accept the works of
his hands. Genesis 4. 4, 5. And the Lord had respect to Abel and to his offering.
But God hears not sinners. John 9. 31. Prove. 15. 8. 21. 27. And of all
sinners the Hypocrite is the greatest sinner. Mat. 22. 11, 12. one not having
on a wedding garment. And he said, Friend, how come thou in here? Rev. 19. 8.
Zach. 3. 1. Psalm. 45. 13, 14. 2 For the thing to be done and suffered. 1 It
must come from a right principle, from the Spirit of God in this new man, and
from his renewed nature. 2 As a consequent of the former, it must be done by
him out of a pure heart (that is) a conscience that does not know of any guilt
or of wilful wickedness toward God or man upon it, but that it does in all
things desire to live according to the Word of God. Acts 23. 1. and 24. 16.
Heb. 13. 18. 1 Timothy 1. 5. Now the end of the commandment is love out of a pure
heart, and good conscience, etc. And there is no work that any profane man
does, that therefore can be good, because it comes from an evil heart, and the
fountain and tree being corrupt, the streams and fruit must be so also. Mat.
12. 34, 35. James 3. 11. Prove. 15. 8. The sacrifice of the wicked is an
abomination to the Lord. Prove. 28. 9. And he must be moved and carried forth
in his doing and suffering by and from right and true considerations and
motives. As from a love and respect to God that commands the work, arising
from the sense of Gods love to his person, a love to the command it self, a
love to the thing commanded. 2 Cor. 5. 14. For the love of Christ constrains
us, etc. 1 John 5. 13. For this is the love of God that we keep his
Commandments. And by, and from a sense and apprehension of Gods Greatness,
Mercy, Goodness, Justice, Holiness, and Wisdom, and his royal command upon
him, his Sovereignty over him, as his Creator, Lord and King, and the
Conscience of his obedience due to God, and the danger of disobedience, Job 31.
1, 2, etc. I made a covenant, etc. Is not destruction to the workers of
iniquity? etc. Does he not see my ways? etc. What then shall I do when he
rises? etc. By reason of his highness I could not endure. Heb. 11. 7. By Faith
Noah being warned of God, etc. moved with reverence, Romans 7. 12. The
Commandment is holy, just, and good. Psalm. 19. 7, 8. The Law of God is
perfect, etc. From the fear of God, a desire to please, and fear to offend
him. Exodus 1. 15, 16, 17. The Midwives feared God. Genesis 42. 18. this do and
live, for I fear God. From a sense of the wrong he has done to God by his sin,
and the plyableness of his heart therein to make what amends to God it can, and
from the great reward there is promised to the obedient. The work I say and
service to be done and thing to be suffered, when well and acceptable must be
undertaken upon these, or some such like motives and considerations. Ps. 44.
21. Ephesians. 5. 14. Col. 3. 22. Heb. 11. 4, 5, etc. But the miscarriage herein is
when one is moved or carried forth herein out of self-love only, for fear that
he may have hurt by the not doing or suffering, or out of hope that he may have
good by the doing or suffering; or when it comes from some erroneous conceit
or opinion of God and his own service to God, that he cannot be without his
service, or is much beholding to him for what he does, or that it is accepted
with God for it self however it be done or the like. Is 66. 1. 2, etc. The
heaven is my throne, etc. (i. e.) do you think that I so much care for your
Temple service: But to this man will I look, i. e. that is him and his service
shall I favor and accept [that is poor and of a contrite spirit that trembles
at my word] that is him that is sensible of his emptiness of grace, and
guiltiness of sin, and has his heart broken for and from sin. This is the soul
which is the temple wherein I will dwell, and these are the sacrifices in such a
soul that I shall accept. He that kills an ox is as if he slew a man (that
is) all these outward performances and services, without these inward
dispositions and affections of soul, are no better than the services and
sacrifices of an heathen than the most vile and horrible crimes committed
against my Law, when he that does them is moved and carried forth therein from
some corrupt or sinister respect, and not by or from any love or fear of God at
all. 1 Cor. 13. 1. 2. Though I speak with the tongue, of men and Angels, and
have not Charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And
though I have the gift of Prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all
knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and
have no charity, I am nothing. See more for this Ps. 33. 18. 34. 18. 138. 6.
147. 6 51. 16, 17. 1 Cor. 3. 16. 3 That there be a warrant or rule for the
thing to be done and suffered. And for this, 1 That the thing to be done or
suffered be commanded, or at the least not forbidden. 2 That it be known too,
and believed by him that does or suffers it. 3 That it be done according to
this rule or command by him known and believed. For the first. The thing to be
done must be good, either it must be commanded, or at least it must not be
forbidden by Gods Word. For if so it be that the thing be forbidden, be it don
never so cordially, or that a man be pressed never so much to it by his
conscience, yet is the thing nevertheless evil. And therefore their sin in
offering their children to Molech. Lev. 20. 2. Jer. 32. 35, 36. and in the
killing of Christ's Disciples was nevertheless sinful for this, nor will a good
intention or meaning in this case help. And therefore we find in 1 Samuel 13. 8,
9, 11. Saul, and 1 Chronicles. 13. 8, 9, 10, 11. Vzzah, both of them severely
punished for the doing (and probably with a good intention) of that which was
good in it self to have been done by another, but evil in them, because it was
a thing prohibited to them. And of this nature is their Popish whipping of
themselves, pilgrimage, fasting, and such like things amongst them, and the
imitation of them by others. Col. 2. 18. 23. Touch not, taste not, etc. which
things indeed have a show of wisdom in will worship and humility, etc. And God
will say of this, as Isa. 1. 12. who has required these things at your hands?
and as Jer. 32. 35. which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind.
Deuteronomy. 12. 8. 2 The thing done must be knowingly and beleevingly done (that is)
he must know it to be commanded, allowed, or warranted by Gods Word; for
otherwise, be it never so lawful, as the eating of flesh, yet if a man doubt of
the lawfulness of it, it is not lawful to him so long as he doubts. For
whatsoever is not of Faith is sin, Romans 14. 1, 2, 3. etc. 23. And it must be
done with a persuasion that God will accept it being so done. Genesis 4. 4. Heb.
11. 4, 6. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain,
etc. But without faith it is impossible to please God, etc. For he that comes
to God must believe that God is, etc And for the third. It must be done for
matter and manner according to the rule of the Word laid down for the doing
thereof. Gal, 6. 16. And to as many as walk according to this rule peace be on
them, etc. Acts 13. 36. But David after he had served his own generation by the
will of God, etc. But the error in this principally is when a man in that he
does and suffers has his eye altogether or chiefly upon his own fancy, or
upon humane Traditions Commands and Inventions. John 4. 21, 22. Ye worship ye
know not what. Mat. 15. 9. In vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines
the commandments of men. Acts 17. 23. Mat. 23 16, 17. And for the manner of
that which is done and suffered it ought to be done with Love and Faith, and in
the fear of God. It must be done in love, 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2. otherwise i^ is
nothing worth. In faith, 1 to God, Heb. 11. 4. For he that comes to him must
believe, etc. 2 In Christ. Col. 3 17. and with the whole heart. It must be
also willingly and cheerfully. 1 Pet. 5. 2. Feed the flock of GOD which is
amongst you, taking the oversight thereof not by constraint, but willingly, not
for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind, Ephesians. 6. 6. Not with eye-service, etc.
doing the will of GOD from the heart: with good will doing service, etc. Heb.
10. 34. Ye took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, etc. Psalm 110. 3. Deuteronomy.
30. 10. Ierem. 31. 33. Genesis 9. 27. 5 The next great thing to be looked unto,
and required in the works we do and things we suffer to make our work therein
acceptable, is the end and design of the heart in it: For as a man may speak
good words to an evil end. Luke 10. 25. Matthew. 22. 15. so one may do good
works to an evil end. The great and maine end and design of the heart in
every thing a man does and suffers, ought to be to and for God (that is) to
please and glorify GOD, and advance the Name of the Lord Jesus by what he
does and suffers, and by his cheerful service therein to testify his love
to God: For this is primarily commanded, Exodus 20. 2, 3. I am the Lo^rd, etc.
Thon shall have no other Gods before me. And this is primarily to be prayed,
and labored for, Mat. 6. 9. Hallowed be thy Name (that is) grant us by thy
Word and Works as thou have manifested thereby, especially by the work of
Redemption by Jesus Christ rightly to know thee in thy wonderful nature and
incomprehensible Attributes, and be brought every way in heart, word, and deed,
to acknowledge, and by a right inward and outward worship of thee to exalt
thee. Whence we may thus argue; That which is of God chiefly required, and of
man chiefly to be desired, to this must every work of man be chiefly intended
and directed. But that already named is that very thing. 1 Cor. 6. 20. Ye are
bought with a price, wherefore glorify him, 1 Cor. 10. 31. Do all to the glory
of God. John 7. 18. But he that seeks his glory that sent him, the same is
true. 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2. 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. John 17. 4. Phil. 1. 21. Cant. 7. 13.
Luke 2. 14, 20. Col. 3. 23, 24 Ephesians. 6, 67. And in the next place his aim and
design must be to do good to the people, especially the Saints amongst whom he
does live. 1 Cor. 10 31, 32, 33. Even as I please all men in all things, not
seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved. 1 Cor.
9. 19, 20. 1 Cor 8. 8, 9, 10. Luke 7. 5, 6. Gal 6. 10. Let us do good to all
men, especially to them who are of the household of Faith. But that which makes
the service Hypocritical and unacceptable in this is, when he that does it,
minds himself only in it, when he does it, either to still the noise of his
own conscience, or to get him a name, or to procure himself some outward
advantage in the world thereby. Joh. 6. 26. Ye follow me for the loaves, etc.
or at the most to save his soul by it, and because that cannot be done
otherwise. And without any love to God to whom the work is done, or love of the
work done. And without any respect at all to Gods glory, or the good of other
men. Ephesians. 6. 5. Col. 3. 22. Not with eye service, as men pleasers. Matthew. 6.
2, 10. Ye do it to be seen of men. Mat. 23. 14. That ye may appear to men,
etc. Or for a worse end, James 4. 3. Ye ask amiss, that you may consume it on
your lusts. Phil. 1. 17. 2 Cor. 4. 2. 5. 12. See more for this in Chap. 7.
Sect. 21.

Object. It may be asked, whether a man in the good he does, and evil he
suffers, may not have an eye also to his own good, a temporal reward here, as
well as to his eternal salvation hereafter.

Answ. To which we answer: Yes doubtless: 1 For God does set this before him
to encourage him in it; and no Scripture motive can draw out any unlawful
affection, and whatsoever Gods Word requires, the Spirit of God works by
degrees in the heart of the Believer. 1 Pet. 5. 4.

2 The servants of God it is true have within them an ingenuous and
supernatural principle, whereby they love God, and holy things because of the
excellency of them; even as a carnal man loves sin, because of the
sutablenesse of it with his own heart. And yet Gods servants in the things they
have done and suffered, have had an eye, yea a fixed and constant eye upon
their own temporal and eternal good also for their encouragement therein, Heb.
11. 14, 26. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a
Country. For he had respect unto the recompense of reward. 3 Our Lord Jesus in
that he did and suffered had an eye to this. Heb. 2. 2. Looking unto Jesus,
etc. who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, etc. And
therefore all amor mercedis is not amor mercenarius. Some make Gods glory and
our happiness to differ as the supreme and subordinate ends, some as coordinate
ends only; but to be sure GOD has so infallibly eonjoyned them together, that
one cannot be without the other. So that by all this now we may try our
selves as to our works, and our works themselves whether they be such as God
will approve; whether they be wrought in God. Gal. 6. 4. But let every man
prove his own works, and then shall he have rejoicing, etc. The more they do
answer to these rules, the more perfect they are; and the more they swerve from
them, the more they savor of Hypocrisy in them.

We shall now in the next place make some other uses of, and infereuces upon
all that we have said, and therein a little enlarge our selves upon the whole
matter before laid down.

CHAP. XI.
Other Conclusions and Inferences upon all the premises.

HAving opened and laid down the main differences that are between the sincere
Christian and the Hypocrite, and how and wherein the true Christian does and
must go beyond the Hypocrite in heart and life: And having in this set forth
the difficulty, pains and charge of a true Christian life, and how far many men
go therein, and yet come short of heaven, and how much there does go to the
making up of a sincere Christian, we shall make some other inferences
thereupon, and uses thereof for the edification of our selves and others in the
Christian Faith. Some of which will be for Information or Instruction, some for
caution or admonition, and some for exhortation.

SECT. I.
1 For Information. 1 To show us somewhat of the reason of the Disciples speech
to Christ, and his answer to them in Luke 23. 23, 24. Lord, are there f^w that
shall be saved? And he said unto them, strive to enter in at the strait gate;
for many I say unto you will seek to enter and shall not be able, etc. And of
Christ's words, Matthew. 7. 13, 14. Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that
leads to life, and few there be that find it. And of that in 1 Pet 4. 18.
If the Righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinners
appear. 2 To show us, that there is great cause to doubt, that amongst the
many glorious Professors of Religion in these days, there may be very few
sincere, and very many And if so, may we not in our time take up the complaints
and lamentations of the holy men of former times, and of such times wherein were
godly Kings, and wherein Religion flourished, as in the time of the Prophet
David. Psalm. 12. 1 Help Lord for the godly fail etc. and of the Prophet
Jeremiah Ierem. 5. 1 run too and fro etc. and see etc. and seek if he can find
a man, if there be any that executes judgment, that seeks the truth etc. And
of the Prophet Isaiah Isai. 59. 15. Yea truth fails, and he that departs
from evil makes himself a prey. And of the Prophet Micah. Micah 7. 1. 2. 4.
the good man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright amongst
men: they are as the grape gleanings of the vintage etc. the best of them is as
a brier, the most upright is sharper then a thorn-hedge; where we have the best
of them of the time, compared to thorns and briers, which are of a hurtful,
catching, scratching pricking, vexing, greiving nature, to all that come near
unto, or meddle with them. Ezech 28. 24. Numb. 34. 55. Judges 9. 14. 15. Josh.
23. 13. And are not most of the glorious Proffessors of Religion of our days
such one toward another. What means else the bitter Envy, malice, wrath,
jealousy. contempt, and evil surmisings of men's hearts within: And from
without, the strife, debate, contention, whispering, backbiting, slandering,
censuring, judging, threatening, provoking, scoffing, scorning, railing,
reproaching, sleighting by gestures, words, and deeds, pass from one of them
toward another. And what else mean the manifold Heresies, Seditions,
Calumniations, Invectives, Confusions and evil works, that are to be found
every where amongst the eminent Professors of the Gospel (agreeing together in
the Head Christ and substance of Doctrine) about differences of ceremony and
circumstance. Have not parties, factions, and interests, almost devoured and
eaten up all appearance of Sincerity amongst us. Prove. 20. 6. Most men
proclaim every man his goodness, but a faithful man who can find? 3 To show
that the sincere Christian is a rare piece and precious jewel in Gods account,
his delight is much in, his heart is much upon him. John 1. 47. Behold an
Israelite indeed, etc. Psalm. 11. 7. His countenance does behold the upright,
etc. 4 To show the gross mistake, and horrible slander that generally does pass
amongst the worst, and against the best men of the time. That all they are a
sort of notorious Hypocrites who are a sort of the most eminent Professors of
the Christian Faith, whereas we have made it appear that such a glorious
profession is of necessity to make up the sincere Christian. And that such
Professors if they are not the men, they are the most like to them of any men
in the world. 5 To show the desperate estate of men that are openly wicked,
that do nothing at all for, or toward their attainment of heaven, but al they
can against it. If the sincere Christian be saved with much difficulty, and if
they that bid so fair for Christ as some Hypocrites do, go without him, they
that bid nothing at all for him are never like to have him. These are not so
much as coming toward, or near to the kingdom of God as the young man in
the Gospel. Mark. 12. 34. 1 Pet 4. 18, If the righteous scarsly be saved,
where then shall the ungodly and sinners appear. If the seeming friends,
followers, and servants of Christ that have owned him as their Lord, seemed to
honor, love, and respect him, and his people, and to give some heed to his
word, and have brought forth some fruit thereof unto him, that have done many
things, and some great things for him, and suffered also much for him; if all
these shall be sent away notwithstanding with a Dep at from me ye that work
iniquity, I know you not, etc. Mat. 6. 21, 22, 23. Luke 13. 24, 25, 26, etc. 1
Cor. 13. 1, 2, etc. Mat. 13 20, 21, 22. And if every tree which brings not
forth good fruit will be cast in the fire, Mat. 3. 10. where shall such
appear* and what will be the end of them that show themselves to be the enemies
of Christ, that hate him, and his people for his sake, Luke 19 14. John 15. 24,
25. That say we will not have this man to rule over us. Luke 19. 14. But let us
break their bonds, and cast away their cords. Psalm 2. 3. and 50. 17. That
refuse to hear Christ speaking, Heb. 12. 25. That neglect the offer of his
grace therein, and will have none of him. Ps. 81. 11. Mat. 23. 37. Heb. 2. 3.
That scoff at it, Acts 2. 30. That blaspheme and contradict it. Acts 13. 15.
That persecute it, the Preachers and Professors of it. Acts 13. 50. and 8. 1.
with slanders, railings, revilings, and every way besides even to the death, as
time does serve for it. Mat. 5 10, 17. Mat. 21. 33, 34. Mat. 25. 48, 49. That
bring forth no fruit but wild grapes. Is. 5. 2. Briars and thorns. Heb. 6. 8.
What will be the end of these men? Their end is to be burned. Heb. 6. 8. They
shall be dashed in pieces like a Potters vessel. Psalm. 2. 9. They shall be torn
in pieces. Ps. 50. 22. He will miserably destroy such wicked men. Mat. 21. 41.
They shall be brought forth and slain before his face. Luke 19. 27. They shall
be cut asunder, and have their portion with hypocrites. Mat. 25. 50 And they
shall not escape. Heb. 2. 3. Nor shall there be any to deliver. Ps. 50. 22. And
as to such as were once the professed friends of Christ, and after become his
professed enemies, what will the end of such men be? we have it in the sin and
punishment both together, in Heb. 10. 26, 27. etc. in these words: For if we
sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there
remains no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of
judgment and fiery indignation. which shall devour the adversaries. He that
despised Moses Law dyed without mercy under two or three witnesses. Of how much
sorer punishment, suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who has trampled under
foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he
was sanctified an unholy thing, and has done despite to the spirit of Grace,
etc.

SECT. II.
2 Our word for caution or admonition is this, That seeing there is so much
guile and deceit herein, and it is so common an evil amongst Professors of
Religion, that we take great heed of it. 1 That we be not deceived by others,
either in their example herein to imitate them. Gal. 2. 13. or to trust them
before we have well tried them, Acts 9. 26. or in their doctrine, especially
in and about the main fundamental points of salvation. This caveat Christ and
his Apostles gave us, Mat. 24. 3, 4. 1 John 3. 7. 2 These. 2. 5. and it is not
without cause: For 1 we are very prone to be deceived herein. Tit. 3. 3. 2 Timothy
3. 13. 2 It is now as it was foretold, and it has been in former times, many
deceivers are in the world, 2 Ioh. 7. Mat. 24. 11. 3 Their deceits as a snare
are deeply and dangerously laid. Ephesians. 4. 14. 2. These. 2. 8, 10. Rom 16. 18. 4
Their deceits are very dangerous to the soul. 2 Pet. 2. 1. 2 Timothy 2. 18. 5 Many
are and shall be seduced and deceived by them. Rev. 11. 23, and 13. 14, 16.
Mat. 24. 5, 11. 6 Yea the very Elect shall be in danger of it. Mat. 24. 24. And
for this, 1 be forewarned of them. Mat. 24. 25. 2 Pet. 3. 17. 2 Pray always to
be preserved. Mat. 6. 13. 3 Try all things before we trust and hold them. 1
John 4. 1. Acts 17. 11. 4 When we see it to be truth, receive it, and receive
it in the love of it. 2 Pet. 3. 14. 2 These. 2. 10. 5 See we grow in grace. 2
Pet. 2. 17, 18. 2 Let us not go about as Impostors to deceive others. Mat. 15.
14. Mat. 21. 15. 1 For we are all very prone to this evil. Tit. 3. 3. 2 Timothy 3.
13. 2 Deceivers are evil men. 3 They shall wax worse and worse. 2 Timothy 3, 13. 4
Herein we shall deceive our selves most of all. Jam. 1. 22, 27. But be ye
doers, etc. and not hearers, etc. Mat. 23. 23. 5 We may deceive men we cannot
deceive God. Luke 16. 15. Gal. 6, 7. 1 Cor. 15. 15. 33. 3 Let us not deceive
our own selves. This caution is given us often. 1 Cor. 3. 18. Gal. 6. 7. For we
are very prone to this also, and it may be very pernicious to us. Gal. 6. 3.
And for our preservation from them let us heed what follows in the nextuses.

SECT. III.
Our third word of Exhortation is. 1 To the Professing followers and appearing
friends of Christ 2 To others. to them which seem to be friends of Christ, to
all such as are entered into the Profession of the Gospel of Christ. We
persuade them, That seeing there is so much deceit, and so many are mistaken
and do miscarry in it, that they do therefore take the more care of themselves
and others herein. And for this. That 1 they do the more fear and suspect
themselves, that they also may be deceived. Is it not seasonable to advise men
to take heed what money they receive when there is much counterfeit coin going
abroad amongst men? And when we hear of many Shipwracks by Sea of Ships richly
laden with many precious Jewels in the way we and others are to pass, is it
not then a good time to persuade our selves and others that are to go that way
to fear, and to look well to our tackling and our way? Many there are,
doubtless very many, that think they are good Christians, and are accepted, and
approved of for such amongst others, but are not so, Rev. 2. 9. call themselves
Jews and are not. Luke 16. 15. And so it will appear at the last. Mat. 7. 21,
22, 23. Lord, Lord in thy name, etc. and I shall profess I never knew you, etc.
Mat. 25. 1, 2, etc. 2 In the second place, Let us try our selves by the Word of
God, by the light and heat where of we may discover the true and sincere from
the false and counterfeit persons and things, as the Eagle does her genuine
young ones by the light and heat of the natural Sunbeams. Let us view our
selves well by this Looking glass, and see what manner of persons we are,
whether true or counterfeit Christians. And there is great reason for it why
we should so do. 1 It is commanded of God, 2 Cor. 13. 5. Try your selves
whether you be in the faith or no. 2 The godly do so Psalm. 139. 23, 24. Search
me O God, etc. try me, etc. Lam. 3. 40. Let us search and try our ways, etc. 3
The thing is of mighty concernment to us, there is life and death, yea life and
death eternal in it; if we be deceived in this point we are everlastingly
undone. Mat. 25. 1, 2, 3, etc. the foolish Virgins. Mat. 7. 22, 23. 4 It can
do us no hurt, nay it cannot but do us some good, to doubt and suspect, and
to labor to know our selves; for all knowledge is sweet, but that of our
selves sweetest of all. And if we find our case good and safe, we shall be
the more settled and established in it. If our case be bad, and we find out, it
may be yet amended. Psalm. 50. 1, 2, etc. v. 16, 22. And if now any man ask us,
what if upon search I find my case doubtful and dangerous, what shall I do?
We answer; The best way is to begin all again, as a man that has laid the
foundation of his building amiss, or is going in a wrong way to his journeys
end; for the Hypocrite and the worst of wicked men as they are alike evil, so
is their case alike dangerous, Mat. 24. 51. compared with Luke 12. 46. In the
third place, then our Exhortation shall be to such as these that have laid an
ill foundation, and to our selves, and all others who are entering into, or
entered, or shall hereafter enter into the profession of Religion, and are
following, or to follow Christ therein, That they and we do seriously consider
of what we are going about, that therein our case is as the case of a man that
is going a long and a dangerous journey, or run a race for a great prize, or
engage in a desperate battle alone, or with others, Ephesians. 6. 12. 2 Timothy 4. 7. or
are going about to set up a great building, or going to make a great purchase.
Mat. 11. 12. It is compared therefore to a pilgrimage, and the Christian
therein to a Pilgrim, Ps. 39. 12. 1 Pet. 2. 11. And it was shadowed out by the
life, travel, and difficulty of the Jews passage from Egypt to Canaan. And
therefore that it will be our wisdom well to consider before hand what it is we
are going about, and how we are prepared for it, and to prepare accordingly.
This is our Saviors advice in the very cose. Mat. 14. 25, etc. for which of
you intending to build a Tower sits not down first and counts the cast.
And that therefore we do as men to go such a journey, or do such a work,
these two things. 1 Remove all hindrances. 2 Provide our selves with all
necessaries for the way and work. Amongst other hindrances herein, let us take
heed, 1 of unbelief, a dangerous sin, by which the Israelites were kept and
hindered from their entrance into the earthly Canaan. Jude 5. Heb. 4. 1, 2,
etc. And this now will keep a man from entering into the heavenly Canaan. Luke
12. 46. 2 The love of the world, which like as the weeds amongst corn, that do
choke and hinder the growth of it; does hinder the work of grace in the heart.
Mat. 13. 22, 23. 2 Timothy 2. 4. And for provision for our journey or our work, 1
Let us look well to our foundation that it be well laid Mat. 7. 24. 13. 22. that
it be laid upon Christ; for other foundation can no man lay than that which is
already laid, which is Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 33. 11 Ephesians. 2^ 20. and that we lay
it low enough. And that for this, we find our hearts by the Word and Spirit of
God not only deeply convinced of our miserable estate by the sin of Adam, and
by our own original, and actual sin, but that we be broken and humbled in
heart for and converted from it. Hab. 6. 1. Acts 2. 37, 38. Ezekiel. 36. 31. And
having a discovery made by this Word and Spirit, that there is a Remedy to be
had in this case by the Lord Jesus Christ, That he will be to the repenting
believing sinner, as the City of Refuge was to the Manslayer. Numb. 35. And as
the poole of Bethesda was to him that was first put into it after the Angel had
troubled it, 10. 5. 2, etc. And as the brazen Serpent was to them that were
stung by the fiery Serpent in the wilderness Numb. 31. 6. And that in him
there dwells all fullness for the supply of all our wants, and cure of all
our maladies. Joh. 1. 16. Col. 1. 19. And so by faith roll and leave our
selves upon him, and take up our eternal rest and lodging in him alone. Cant.
8. 5. Joh. 6. 67, 68. Mat. 4. 22 Mark 10. 28. Mat. 19. 21. and 13 46 Phil 3. 7,
8. 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5. Heb. 4. 4, 5. And being thus got into Christ by faith, let
us be assured of help, that our sin is pardoned, and that we are taken into
favor by him. Then in the next place let us look to the progress of our
building, that being thus rooted, engrafted into, and built upon Christ, we
make it out by the work of Regeneration and Sanctification in us, that we be
partakers of the Divine nature, that we have a seed and principle of grace
within us, that Christ lives in us, and we in him; that we are now Christ like,
of his mind, and making, and that we live, walk, and do as he did in this
world. Heb. 3. 14. 2 Pet. 1. 4. Ephesians. 1. 10. 1 Cor. 10. 17. Ephesians. 3. 17. Col.
2. 7. 1 Pet. 1. 23. and 4. 1. 1 John 2. 6. And thus being built upon and rooted
in Christ, and making it so to appear. Let us see we abide and grow up in him,
and be more and more fruitful to his praise. Ephesians. 2. 21. and 4. 15. Luke 8. 11,
12, 13. Romans 7. 4. and 12. 1. Ps. 92. 14. Heb. 6. 9, 10. But for a more
particular provision and preparation for this great work; let us provide our
selves especially with these things. ^ Get much of the knowledge of God and his
ways within us; so men use to do that have a long and dangerous journey to
go, to take notes of all the Towns they are to go through, and places of danger
they are to go by; and they that go by sea, to have their Card and Compass. And
for this, to see we be well skilled in the Word of God, which will be a light
to our feet, Ps. 119. 105. And like the Star, Mat 2. 7, 9. to lead us to
Christ. And enquire much, and ask often of others that know the way, and can
tell us the dangers, as men do in a journey in places unknown. But especially
pray for the teaching and guidance of the Spirit of God, promised to Gods
people in this case, for this end, Isa. 30. 21. Luke 11. 13. And keep in mind
and forget not what we have learned, that being forewarned we be forearmed.
Mat. 24. 25. Luke 14. 25. 2 Let us carry much faith with us, for this is a
victorious grace as it engages Gods strength with us and for us, and draws
virtue from the promise. This will make the hardest things easy, and that
nothing shall be impossible. Hab 2. 4. 2 Cor. 1. 24. 1 Pet. 1. 7. 1 John 5. 4.
Heb. 11, throughout. 1 Pet. 1. 5. 2 Cor. 4, 5, 6. Ephesians. 6. 16. 1 Pet. 5. 9. 3
Patience, we shall have need and use of this always, and therefore we are
much, and often pressed to get much of it about us. Heb. 10. 36. Luke 21. 19.
Romans 12. 12. Rev. 13 10. James 5. 7. 4 The love of God, for this will make us
willing and able to do and suffer any thing for God. 1 Cor. 13 7 Genesis 29. 20.
5 Sobriety and Temperance. 1 Pet. 5. 8. 5 Let us see we set these graces still
on Work as there is occasion. James 1. 4. Heb. 12. 1. Our faith especially in
our contemplation of the glory that is to come. Heb. 12. 2. For which cause we
faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day
by day, etc. while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things
which are not seen, etc. 6 Let us see we be not srcure but watchful, Rev. 16.
5. Ephesians. 6. 8. 2. Cor. 6. 5. Rev. 3. 2. Mat. 24. 42, 43, 44, 48. 1 Pet. 5. 8.
7 Let us not be idle but diligent in Gods work. Math. 24. 46. and 25. 16, 17.
Mat. 20. 6. 2 Pet. 3. 4. 2 Pet. 1. 6 Pray always, and watch thereunto with all
perseverance for Gods presence, guidance, support, etc. Ephesians. 6. 18. Jude 20.
Ps. 119. 9. Ps. 56. 13.

Our fourth word of Exhortation shall be to persuade all men to have a high
esteem, and make a great account of all such who give evidence of their
integrity in the profession of Religion. Let them be the men of our choice for
our company, Ps. 16. 3. and 119. 63. For our places of Trust in the
Commonwealth. 1 Samuel 22. 13. Neh. 9. 8. and 13. 13. 2 Timothy 2. 2. Prove. 25. 13.
For our servants in our families. Ps. 101. 6. And for all our other works and
business. Ps. 15. 4.

Our fifth word of Exhortation is to all men professing Religion, That seeing
it is so (as we have showed) That so many go so far toward, and yet go
without it; they strive for it, and yet cannot get it, that we strive the more
earnestly, and labor the more abundantly herein. And this is the very use that
our Savior does make of this point. Luke 13. 23, 24. Lord, are there few that
shall be saved? And he said nnto them, strive to enter in at the strait gate,
etc. Shall we come so near to it and go without it? Mark 12. 34. Shall we do
and suffer so much for it in vain? Gal. 3. 4. Shall we get on Mount Nebo in
sight of Canaan and not enter it? Shall we bid almost to one penny the full
price for Christ, and let another come after us and take away our bargain from
us? God forbid. Let us resolve, though it cost us our blood we will have it,
and that we will go beyond all the Hypocrites in the world, let them go as far
as they can. But happily some man may say here, To what purpose shall we strive
if there be such a difficulty in it; it is impossible by all the labor in the
world to be done. To this we answer. 1 It is certain the work is hard and
difficult, and yet it is not so hard as to be impossible, but it is possible
may be done. 2 Timothy 4. 7. 1 Cor. 9. 24. Mat. 11. 12. and Mat. 7. 7. 2 There is
no possibility of having it without this pains and labor. And it will be
therefore in this, as in men that are eligible to a place or office for which
many do stand each of which and no others are capable; in this case any one of
them that stand for it may possibly have it, but he that never labors for it
will never have it. Mat. 11. 12. should not this provoke a man to labor the
more for it. And so should the difficulty in this case provoke all men to be
the more industrious to attain it. 3 If we have it not we are without question,
and inevitably lost and undone for ever. Our case in this therefore is like the
Leprous men, 2 Kings 7. 4. If we sit still in our natural and impenitent
estate, we are sure to dye there. Let us therefore resolve as they did, Let us
fall into the host of the Syrians, if they save us alive we shall live; and if
they kill us we shall but die. So let us say, we will do our utmost for
heaven, we will put our selves upon the mercy of God in Christ Jesus, and
strive with all our might for heaven, if we perish, we perish, we can but dye.
4 But in the last place: If we shall do our utmost endeavor in truth to
attain it, we have no cause to doubt the assistance of Gods grace, and our
acceptance and success the rein; for God is gracious, and Christ is ready to
receive us, and has promised so to do, and he is faithful and able to perform
what he promises. Math. 11 28. Joh. 5. 40 Joh. 7. 37. Joh. 6. 37 Mat. 7. 7.
Phil. 1. 6. and 2. 12, 13. 2 Pet. 3 9. And laying aside every weight, and the
sin which does so easily beset us. let us run with patience the race that is
set before us, H. b. 12. 1, 2. and 2. 1, 2, etc. and so much the rather be
diligent to add one grace to another, and one degree of Grace to another, etc.
2 Pet. 1. 6, 7. etc. And let us work out our salvation with fear and trembling.
Phil. 2. 12. Let us endure the cross, despise the shame. Heb. 12. 2. Take up
the cross and follow Christ. Mark 10. 21. Suffer and die with him. 2 Timothy 2.
11, 12. Leave all for his sake, Mark 10. 28. Strive to enter into Heaven. Luke
13. 24. and take it by force. Mat. 11. 12. Fight the good fight of Faith, and
finish our course. 2 Timothy 4. 7. do the singular things required of us. Mat. 5.
47. Afflict our souls. Lev. 16. 29. James 4. 9. Put a knife to the throat.
Prove. 23. 3. Mortify the deeds of the body. Romans 8. 13. Crucify the old man,
the flesh with the affections and lusts. Gal. 5. 21. Romans 6. 6. Deuteronomy. 10 16.
Let the foreskin of our hearts be circumcised, and let us circumcise our
selves to the Lord, and let us break up our fallow grounds. Jer. 4. 3. 4. Be
crucified to the world and the world to us. Gal. 6. 14. Keep down our body, 1
Cor. 9. 27. Pull out our right eye, and cut off our right hand, that causes us
to offend. Mat. 5. 29, 30. Suffer the loss of all things, and count them but
dung for Christ. Phil. 3. 8. 9. Refrain our seet from every evil way. Ps. 119.
10. Strive for Masterie. 1 Cor. 9. 25. and rejoice as not rejoicing. 1 Cor. 7.
30. And thus doing we may be sure and certain that we are not cast-awaies, 1
Cor. 7. 27 Gods wrath shall not break forth upon us. Jer. 4. 4. We shall not
come into condemnation. John 5 24. nor be cast into hell fire. Mat. 5. 29. and
188. that we shall never fall. 1 Pet. 1. 10. that we shall not die but live,
not perish but have everlasting life and glory. John 3. 15. 2 Timothy 2. 9. 10.
11. Mark 10. 30. Romans 8. 13. And we may be confident that we shall enter into
joy. Mat. 25. 23. life. Mat. 18. 8. rest. Heb. 4. 2 These. 2. 8. live and reign
with Christ 2 Timothy 2. 11, 12. Romans 8. 13. Have and enjoy the incorruptible
crown of Righteousness, life and glory 1 Timothy 4. 8. 1 Cor. 9. 24, 25. Rev. 2.
10. be received into everlasting habitations. Luke 16. 9. enjoy the fullness of
pleasures at Gods right hand. Ps. 16. 11. and be satisfied. Ps. 17. 5. Sit down
and feast for ever with Christ and his people. Mat. 8. 11. and that we shall go
into life eternal, Mat. 46. And we cannot miss it, for ours is the kingdom of
heaven: we have eternal life; and are passed from death to life (i.) we are as
sure of it as if done already.

Our sixth and last word of Exhortation is to all that now do, or hereafter
shall appear as Christians, and follow Christ in the profession of Religion,
and have a form of godliness. To persuade them to Sincerity and against
Hypocrisy herein, to be pure and upright in heart and life. And that they lie
not to God and men, whiles they pretend to be, and have the name of Christians,
and are not so indeed but counterfeit ones only. To persuade them (and oh that
we might prevail herein) that they would lay aside al manner of guile and
deceit herein: And labor to be plain and simple hearted in thought word and
deed. That they do not compass God about with lies, and flatter and dissemble
with him whiles their hearts are not right and perfect before him. That they do
not pretend to prefer God above all, and have no other God but him, whiles they
love, fear, and trust in themselves, and other men and things more than God,
seek the praise of men more than the praise of God: That they call not God
their Father and Master whiles they despise his Name, and do not honor him as
a son his father, nor fear him as a servant his master. That they do not
teach Gods fear by the precepts of men. That they give not to God a worse, when
they have a better to give him in his service. That they do not pretend to
enquire after, seek, serve, and obey him with their whole heart, whiles they
seek themselves, and to serve themselves upon God therein. That they do not
pretend to faith, love, repentance, fear, and the like toward God, whiles they
know there is no such thing, but the contrary thereof in their heart. That they
do not pretend to draw nigh to God in his worship, whiles their hearts are far
removed from him and it. That they do not pretend to form of godlyness, whiles
they deny the power thereof. That they do not say they know him, and keep not
his commandments. That they do not profess to know God, whiles in their
works they deny him. That they do not say they are Saints, whiles they live
like not devils. That they do name the Name of the Lord, unless they depart
from iniquity And as for Rulers of Churches, Christian Commonwealths, and
Families, Judges, and such like men; that they say not they rule and judge for
God, and lean upon him, whiles they seek themselves, and their own things, and
not the things of God, and the peoples good. And for Christian Teachers, etc.
That they say not they are of God, sent of Christ, Ministers of the Gospel, and
workers with Christ, etc. whiles they appear to be deceitful workers, to speak
lies in hypocrisy, to deceive the simple with fair words, to seek to please
men, to seek their own things, and not the things of Jesus Christ, to serve
their bellyes, to make merchandise of men's souls, to hunt after filthy lucre,
and so go themselves, and lead others with them to destruction. And that
neither Heads, Priests, nor Prophets lean upon the Lord and say, He is amongst
us, whiles they judge for reward, teach for hire, and divine for money. Mic. 3.
11. Ps. 50. 16, 17. Mat. 23. 27, 28. Isa. 29. 13. 1 John 2. 4. Mat. 7. 22, 23.
Is. 43. 24. Ps. 78. 36, 37. But on the other side let us persuade such men
professing godliness, That they get the new life, the immediate principles and
habits of Grace, and the operations, motions, effects, and fruits thereof. And
then that they labor for, and get a perfect heart, a heart perfect with the
Lord. 1 Chronicles. 29. 19. That they walk before God in truth, and with a perfect
heart. 2 Kings 20. 3. 2 Chronicles. 29. 2. Genesis 17. 1. That they do the thing that
is good and right, and with a perfect heart as in Gods sight. 2 Kings 20. 3. 2 Chronicles. 25. 2. That they draw near to, serve and seek God with their whole

their account thereof with joy at the last day. Heb. 13. 17. And now for our
last word to others, that do not so much as appear to be the friends, but
rather the enemies of Christ; Let us persuade them only to lay down their
weapons and give over their opposition against Christ; for he will be too
strong for them. It is hard to kick against the priks. Acts 9. 5. 1 Cor. 10.
22. Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? Mat. 21. 44.
And therefore what the Prophet, Ps. 2. 10, 11. said to great men, we say to
all. Be wise now therefore, etc. kiss the son, etc. And now having set forth
wherein the Christians life does consist, and the difficulty thereof, it is
high time we lay down some motives or encouragements and helps therein.

CHAP. XII.
Arguments to persuade to Sincerity, and against Hypocrisy in the general.

THE next thing we have to do is to lay down something by way of motive, to
persuade not only to a Christian life, but also to Sincerity and against
Hypocrisy therein. And this first in general: And in the next place, in
particular services, to persuade us to be Christians indeed, to the profession
of the Christian faith, and to sincerity therein. And to move us to labor to
be, and to keep sincere in our state, or in the general: Besides what we have
before laid down, let us take up and use these following considerations. 1
Hypocrisy in Religion is a sin we are all very prone to; for every man by
nature is an Hypocrite, and every true Christian has more or less hypocrisy in
him. Job 31. 33. If I cover my transgressions as Adam by hiding mine iniquity
in my bosom. Genesis 3. 12. Hence it is that Christ bids his Disciples beware of
it. Mat. 6. 1. Luke 12. 1. 2 Yea it is much to be feared, that Hypocrisy in
Religion is now very common, and that Hypocrites are very many, and that
Hypocrisy is now become the general disease of the time, because there is now
more to breed and feed it than in former times, Religion is now in request, and
the greatest and most of men be religious. Religion is now looked upon with a
good eye, and religious godly men are now in great esteem with the greatest men
of the time; so that it is now as in the time spoken of in Esth. 8. 17. The
Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honor, etc. and a good day, and
many of the people of the land became Jews, for the fear of the Jews fell upon
them. A false heart will work upon this, and the man in whom it is will for his
outward advantage in the world put himself into any form of Religion. 1 Timothy 6.
5. 3 The sin of Hypocrisy in the nature and working of it is a most dangerous
sin. For, 1. It is a soul-pleasing sin, being a part of the old man, and
natural to us. Ps. 52. 3. thou love evil, etc. and lying, etc. Hosea 12. 7,
8. Col. 3. 9. 2 It is a soul killing sin. Acts 8. 21, 22, 23. 3 It is of a very
infectious nature. Gal. 2. 12, 13. 4 It is (as we have said) a very common
evil: where the contagion of the plague is common, the danger is greater. 5 It
is hardly discerned in him in whom it is. It is (as we say in the Proverb) spun
with a fine thread; it cannot be spyed by another. Nay it is in some cases hard
to be found by him in whom it is. The refined hypocrisy, and hypocrite are in
themselves in some cases very hard to be found at all. And the gross Hypocrisy
after a long continuance therein is by him in whom it is hardly discerned also;
for it is with him as a liar, who by often repeating of his lies, begins to
believe them to be true; so the Hypocrite at length deceives himself. James 1.
26. And because the Hypocrite is of God judicially blinded and hardened in it;
it being just with God to punish deceit with deceit, and therefore Hypocrisy
does very often end in hardness and gross blindness. Hosea 12. 7, 8. And
Ephraim said, yet I am become rich, etc. In all my labors they shall find no
iniquity, etc Isa. 30. 1, 2. 6 It is now become a gainful and profitable sin.
7 It is hardly to be cured, not only because it is hardly discerned, but also
because he that is sick of it, is not willing to be cured of it; for it is his
trade of life, and seldom or never do we hear of such an Hypocrite converted
from his Hypocrisy; for the Hypocrite can hardly be drawn to see, more hardly
to be sensible of, and most hardly to use the means for the cure of his
disease. Or if he do use means, such is the nature of Hypocrisle that it turns
the medicine into poison, and it a boseth Religion to the feeding of the
humor, to the destruction of the soul; nor can he expect any good by the
means whiles he does so continue. Ier. 9. 6. 8 It is a kind of Idolatry and
Atheism both together. It is in effect to say God cannot see,; for all the
profession, speaking, acting, and thoughts of the Hypocrite are always for
himself, he makes himself his primum principum, and his finis ultimus, and so
sets himself in the place of, or rather above God; to give to God the worst,
and to himself a sinful man the best. 9 There is a kind of blasphemy in it.
Rev. 2. 9. 1 Timothy 1. 13. 10. It is a piece or degree of the sin again the Holy
Ghost Mat. 12. 24, 29 30, 31. 4 It is, as a dangerous, so a loathsome and
abominable sin, abhorred of God and all good men; for it is a lie, and a lie to
God. Hos. 11. 12. Yea it is abhorred even of nature in self, and therefore no
man can endure to be called Hypocrite or dissembler. It is therefore (as one
says of it) the plague of all plagues; in its own nature a desperate sin, a
deadly disease; for it smites at the vital parts of a man; it eats out all life
and goodness out of the will, in time puts out the eyes of the mind, deadeth
and seareth the natural conscience, eats out the good affections in the heart.
It is a rottenness at the core, leaven in the midst, poison in the Fountain, it
corrupts the heart from whence it diffuseth it self as it were through all the
veins of the whole conversation. And Sincerity will keep a man from all this
danger. 5 Sincerity is a most amiable and desirable thing in it self; for if
the appearance of godliness be so desirable, that the Hypocrite does assume it,
what is the thing it self, that must needs be much more disirable? And if the
appearance of sin be so dangerous and abhorred, much more then is the sin it
self. 6 Sincerity is of God, and a fruit of his Spirit in us. James 3. 17. and
1. 17. The wisdom that is from above is first pure, etc. without hypocrisy,
etc. Every good gift is from above: etc. But Hypocrisy is from the devil, and
our own corrupt hearts. 7 Sincerity is commanded of God, Josh. 24. 14. Now
therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and truth. Deuteronomy. 10. 12.
And now Israel what does the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the
Lord thy God, etc. with all thy heart, and with all thy soul. Prove. 23. 16. My
son give me thy heart. But Hypocrisy is forbidden of God. Ephesians. 6. 6, 7 Not
with eyeservice as men pleasers, etc. Mat. 6. 16. Moreover when ye fast be not
as the Hypocrites, etc. 8 Sincerity is commended of God and good men. John 1.
42. Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile. Behold him, as if he had
said, It is a rare sight, and of high praise, to be admired where it is, where
is there such another? show him me if you can, who can be compared to him? Job
1. 1. Whose name was Job, and that man was perfect and upright, etc 1 King. 11.
4. His heart was not perfect with the Lord his God as was the heart of David
bis Father. 2 Chr. 22. 9. Iehosaphat who sought the Lord with all his heart.
Romans 2. 29. He is not a Jew that is one outwardly, but he is a Jew that is one
inwardly, whose praise is not of men but of God. 2 King. 23. 25. And like unto
him was there no king, etc. that turned to the Lord with all his heart. 3 John
5. Luke 19. 17, 18. But Hypocrisy is dispraised of God and good men, Act. 8.
23. Thou art in the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity. Mat. 23.
throughout. 9 By Religion, and by Sincerity therein a man may be saved. Mat.
58. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Ps. 15. 1. He that
walks uprightly, etc. he shall never be moved. But without sincerity in
Religion a man can no more be saved than by profaneness or wickedness of life.
Jude v. 5. The Lord having saved, etc. afterward destroyed them that believed
not, etc. 1 Cor. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Psalm. 119. 2. 10 God loves, desires,
and delights much in sincerity, and in the sincere man; his eye is never off
him. Ps. 51. 6. Behold thou desire truth in the inward parts. Ps. 11. 7. For
the righteous Lord loves righteousness, and his countenance does behold the
upright. Prove. 11. 20. They that are of a froward heart are an abomination to
him. But such as are upright in their way are his delight 1 Chronicles. 29. 17. I
know, etc. that thou triest the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness Is. 66.
2. But to this man will I look, even to him that is poor, etc. Job 36. 7. But
God hates Hypocrisy, and the Hypocrite for it. Mal. 1. 10. I have no pleasure
in you, says the Lord of hosts. Zach. 11. 8. and my soul loathed them, and
their soul abhorred me, etc. 11 All the perfection a Christian can have in this
life is in his sincerity. And the sincere man only is the good, and perfect
man. And God accounts him perfect that is sincere. It is said for this, that
the same word in Hebrew serves for both, to show us, that he that is sincere is
perfect. 2 Kings 20. 3. Job 1. 8. and 2. 3. Ps. 125. 4. Genesis 6. 9. 12 God
himself is most upright, and does in uprightness all that he does; and so is
Christ; and so is all that he does and faith. If. 26. 7. Thou most upright
do, weigh the paths of the just. Jer. 32. 41. I will rejoice over them to
do them good, etc. with my whole heart, and whole soul. Psalm. 25. 8. Good and
upright is the Lord, etc. And it is said of Christ, 1 Pet. 2. 22. There was no
guile found in his mouth. 13 There is, and will be nothing but up rightness in
heaven. Ps. 143. 10. Lead me into the land of uprightness. 14 The Saints in all
times have been, and the Saints now are all of them upright, and they have been
careful to be and continue so, and to decline hypocrisy. Is. 26. 7. The way
of the just is uprightness. Cant. 1. 4. the upright love thee, John 1. 47. Ps.
32. 2. and in whose spirit there is no guile. Rev. 14. 5. and in their mouths
was found no guile. Prove. 13. 5. a righteous man hates lying, etc. Zeph. 3.
13. 15 All that a man has (let him have what he can) And all that a man does
(let him do what he can) without Sincerity is nothing. This is the Christians
master piece, and makes him to excel amongst men; For God esteems every man,
and he is accepted in what he does, and has, within him, and without him, as
he is sincere. 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2. And though I have all knowledge, etc. and have
not love, etc. I am nothing, etc. it profits me nothing, etc. Gen 4. 4. Heb.
11. 4. God had respect to Abel and his offering; by faith Abel offered a more
excellent sacrifice than Cain, etc. God testifying of his gifts, etc. Prove. 15.
8. The prayer of the upright is his delight. And if a man be sincere,
notwithstanding he has many weaknesses, and his services be but mean and
defective for the matter and manner thereof, yet he is accepted, and shall be
rewarded for the good is in him, and done by him. So Asa 2 Chronicles. 14. 2.
compared with chapter 16. 1, 2, 3, 7. 10. and 1 Kings 15. 11, 14, 15. and 15.
5, 6, etc. compared with 2 Chronicles. 30. 15, 18, 19. But on the other side if he
be an Hypocrite, albeit he have many singular gifts, and do many glorious
things, he is no body, he is not regarded, nor shall be rewarded: And no work
that the Hypocrite does, though never so glorious, pleases God, but his most
glorious workers, though of Gods own Institution, are abominable to him for the
Hypocrites sake that does them. Therefore of the most glorious works that
Hypocrites ever did, or can do, the Lord speaks after this manner; Who has
required these things of you? Isa. 1. 11. Psalm 50. 16, 17. To what purpose are
they? Isaiah 1. 11. Your labors are but in vain in it. Mat. 15. 8, 9. I am not
pleased with them, I shall not accept or regard them. Micah 6. 7. Psalm 66. 18.
Malach. 1. 10. Hosea 8. 13. Nor shall I reward them. Mat. 7. 21, 22, 23, etc. 1
Cor. 13. 3. They are to me sinful, Isaiah 1. 11. Psalm 109. 7. Isaiah 66. 1,
2, 12, 13. Grievous, abominable, and hateful. Amos 5. 21. Hosea 9. 4. Isaiah
62. 1, 2, 12, 13. Prove. 15. 8. See 2 Kings 10, 1, 2, 3, etc. 16, 17, etc.
compared with Hosea 1. 4. 1 Samuel 15, 16, 17. and 14. 35. and 13. 12, 13. 2 Chronicles. 25. 2, 4, 7, 8, 9. 16 God sees, knows, and judges of every man what
he is, and as he is; not as he seems, or thinks himself to be, or as men do see
him. And every man shall be made known, and seem to the world as he is. And
shall receive of God according to what he is in Gods acccount, whether it be
good or evil. Isa. 26. 7. Thou most upright do weigh the paths of the just.
Prove. 21. 2. Every way of a man is upright in his own eyes, but the Lord
pondereth the hearts. 1 Chronicles. 28. 9. And thou Solomon know the Lord God etc.
for the Lord searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of
the thoughts, etc. 1 Cor. 3. 13. Every man's work shall be manifest, for the day
shall declare it. Prove. 16. 2 and 21. 2. The ways of a man are clean in his
own eyes, but the Lord weighs the spirits, 2 Cor. 5. 9, 10. Wherefore we
lobour, that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him: For we must
all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the
things done in his body according to that he has done, whether it be good or
bad. Rev. 2. 2. Luke 12. 3. Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness
shall be heard in the light, and that which ye have spoken in the ear in
closets shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops. Mat. 10. 26. there is nothing
covered that shall not be revealed. Job 31 4. does not he see my ways, and
count all my steps? Rev. 2. 23. Ps. 7. 10. and 26. 2. 17 Sincerity is that
only that can, and will in this world distinguish us from Hypocrites and
devils, who may and can (as we have showed at large) make a fair show in the
flesh, and do and suffer as much therein as the best Christian in the world.
Numb. 22. 40. Luke 8. 28. 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2, etc. Job 2. 1. Mat. 13. 29. 18 If a
man be an Hypocrite he is still unregenerate, and in his natural estate, and
so long all that is in him, and comes from him is evil in Gods eye, he cannot
do a good work. That he does, as to God is as the breath of one that has an
unsavory breath, let him speak never so good words, his breath is
notwithstanding unsavory still. His thoughts, Genesis 6. 5. Ps. 50. 16. All his
actions civil. Prove. 21. 4. Titus 1. 15. Religious. Prove. 15. 8, 9. and 28. 9.
Is. 58. 1. etc. Hosea 1. 4. albeit it may be materially good, and so rewarded
of God as Iehu's work, yet is it Theologically evil. And so they are but
glorious sins. And so it is of al his moral actions, works of Charity, Mercy,
and Justice. Mat. 6. 5. So his words, he may speak and think of good things,
but cannot have good speeches, nor good thoughts. As on the other side, a good
man may think of evil things, and yet his thoughts thereof be good: yea this
very wisdom of the Hypocrite is sin. Rom 8, 7. Col 2. 18, 19. How can a corrupt
tree bring forth good fruit. Mat 7 18 He wants love to God, and seeks not God,
but himslfe in what he does, and therefore cannot be accepted. 1 Cor 13. 1, 2,
etc. No more than a woman in all her observances of her Husband, when she loves
another man better than him, and uses her observances only to cover and
conceal it. 19 It is a high point of wisdom to be sincere, and a huge piece of
folly to be deceitful; for a man takes as much pains to destroy himself, as
would save him; and he is utterly deceived, and disappointed in all that he
does and thinks in it. ps. 101. 1. 2. I will behave my self wisely in a
perfect way, etc. Mat. 7. 24, 27. the wise and foolish builders. Job 15. 35.
they conceive mischief and bring forth vanity, etc. Mat. 25. 1, 2. The wise
and foolish Virgins. 20 Sincerity will breed a constancy and evenness in all
our outward behavior. Grace and Nature both begin at the heart as the center,
and from thence goes to the circumference: But Art and Hypocrisy begin with
the face and outward lineaments. James 1. 8. He is unstable in all his ways.
James 4. 8. 21 There is no good to be expected by any means of Grace while we
be hypocritical. Ier 9. 6. Through deceit they refuse to know me, says the
Lord. 1 Pet. 2. 1. Laying aside all malice, guile, and hypocisie etc. As new
born babes. etc. But the Word of God and means of grace shall be good to the
upright. Mic. 2. 7. Do not my words do good to him that walks uprightly. 22
Hypocirisie does commonly end in Apostasy. 1 John 2. 19. They went out from
us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt
have continued with us. 1 Timothy 1. 20. 2 Timothy 2. 18. But the upright shall never
fall, Ps 15. 5. He shall never be moved. and 37. 31. none of his steps shall
slide. Mat. 24. 24. they shall deceive if it were possible the very elect. 23
The Hypocrite dishonors God. Romans 2. 21, 24. The name of God is blasphemed,
through you, etc. And he hurts and grieveth men. Mat. 13. 35. 4. As the tares
annoy the wheat. Deuteronomy. 29. 18, 19. Heb 12. 15. least any root of bitterness,
etc. trouble you, and thereby many be defiled. 24 No Hypocrite shall ever enjoy
God: for he will never give himself to be possessed and enjoyed of a spiritual
Adultress, who does affect any other lover more or besides him. Mat. 6. 24. No
man can serve two Masters, etc. 25 Honor and glory attends upon Sincerity. But
shame and dishononr does follow Hypocrisy. Psa. 119. 8. Let my heart be sound
in thy statues that I be not ashamed. 26 Sincerity is a sure sign of our being
in the state of Grace, the true and living members of Christ mystical body. He
that is sincere only is a true member of the Church Militant here, and shall
be a member of the Church Triumphant in heaven. Romans 2. 29. He is a Jew that is
one inwardly. etc. Psalm. 15. 1, 2, 6. Lord who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He
that walks uprightly.. etc. He that does these things shall never be moved.
2 Cor. 1. 12. 1 John 3 21, But the hypocrite in Gods account, and by the
judgment of the Word of God is a wicked and ungodly man. Psalm. 69. 27. Add
iniquity to their inquitie, and let them not come into thy righteousness. Psalm.
50. 16. But unto the wicked God says, what have thou to do, etc. Jude 4.
ungodly men turning the grace of God, etc. and therefore to have his portion
with unbeleevers. Luke 12. 46. compared with Mat. 24. 51. Psalm. 24. 4. 27 All
the promises of God for good* as to this life, and that to come, are made to
him that is sincere in Religion, and to him only. 1 Generally; That he shall be
blessed here, and for ever. Mat. 5. 8. Blessed are the pure in heart. Ps. 112.
2. The generation of the upright shall be blessed. Ps. 84. 2. The generation of
the upright shall be blessed. Ps. 84. 2. He is a sun and a shield, will give
grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk
uprightly. Psalm 32. 2. Ps. 119 1, 2. But all the threatenings of evil for this
life and that to come are against the Hypocrite by name, and as fully and
severely as against any wicked or ungodly person whatsoever; and against them
all: That the Hypocrite shall be cursed here and for ever. Prove. 28. 13. He
that hides his sin shall not prosper. Isa. 10. 6. As to this life. 1 In
general. God may seem sometimes to neglect the upright man, and may be thought
to favor the Hypocrite, but he does not so. The sincere man may be weak in
himself, be compassed with many spiteful enemies, and be hated, and suffer
the more for his sincerity; he may have many troubles, yet God knows it, and
him in it, and will be with him. He will be his strength, support him under,
and deliver him out of them, and order all events to his good He shall have
good things in his possession here, have peace in his end, and for ever. For it
is said, they shall remain in the land for ever, and leave their inheritance to
their children, who shall be blessed after them. Prove 14. 11. The Tabernacle of
the upright shall flourish. 1 Kings 3. 6. And Solomon said, thou have showed
unto thy servant David my father great mercy according as he walked before thee
in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee, etc.
Psalm. 35. 18. Psalm. 24. 4, 5. He that has clean hands, and a pure heart. He
shall receive the blessing, etc. Prove. 28. 10. Psalm 94 15. 64. 10. But the
contrary of all this shall come upon the Hypocrite, for he shall be cursed.
Mal. 1. 14. Cursed be the deceiver, etc. Psalm. 69. throughout. Isa. 9. 17.
Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have
mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an hypocrite, and an
evil doer, and every mouth speaks folly, etc. Job 15. 34. The congregation of
Hypocrites shall be desolate. Job 18. 9, 19. and 20. 22, 23. and 8 6. Jer. 42.
20, 21, 22. But more particularly in this life the sincere man shall be
blessed; for he shall have great prosperity, and outward blessings. Deuteronomy. 11.
13, 14 Plenty of corn, wine, and oil. Isa. 33. 16. Bread shall be given him,
his water shall be sure. And for this end fruitful seasons, etc. The sincere
man shall be blessed in his children. Prove. 20. 7. The just man walk. the in
his integrity: His children are blessed after him. But the children of the
Hypocrite shall be cursed. Psalm. 109. 9, 10. etc. Let his children be
continually vababonds, and beg: Let them seek their bread also out of their
desolate places. The sincere man shall be established, and continue in his
prosperity. 1 Kings 9. 4, 5. 2 Samuel, 22. 24. 26. But the prosperity of the
Hypocrite shall be but for a little while. Psalm. 58. 1, 8. 9. Do ye speak
righteousness, etc. do ye judge uprightly. As a snaile which melts let every
one of them pass away, like the untimoly birth of a woman, that they may
notsee the sun. Before your pots can feel the thorns he shall take them away as
with a whirlwinde, both living and in his wrath. Job 20. 58. That the
triumphing of the Hypocrite is short, and his joy but for a moment. It shall
fly away as a dream, or as the good that one dreameth of: The true Christian
shall have sound peace and joy, and be in safety, but the Hypocrite in
continual danger and fear. Prove. 10. 9. and 28. 18. The true Christian can go
to God with boldness, and confidence in any time of trouble, and God will
hear him, 2 Kings 20. 3, 4. And Hezekiah prayed, and said, O Lord remember how
I have walked before thee with a perfect heart, etc. 2 Cor. 1. 12. For our
rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, etc. Psalm. 26. 1. But the
Hypocrite in such a case cannot do so, either he will forsake God therein,
and not seek to him, as Judas, Mat. 27. 1, 2. etc. Or if he do, God will not
hear him, Job 27. 9. will God hear his cry when trouble comes? The true
Christian shall be either preserved from, or in and under all times and cases
of temptation and affliction, and be well delivered out of them: For God is his
defense, and his everlasting arms are about him, and he will comfort, support,
and save him. Psalm 37. 19. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time. Mat. 7.
24. Mat. 13. 5, 6, 7, 8, 23. Psalm 84. 11. God is his shield, etc. Is. 33. 16.
He shall dwell on high, his place of defense shall be the munitions of Rocks,
etc. 2 Chronicles. 16. 9. For the eyes of the Lord run too and fro throughout the
whole earth to show himself in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect
toward him. Psalm 119. 80. Psalm 25. 21. Psalm 97. 11. 2 Samuel 22, 23, 24. 25.
Psalm 7. 10. But the Hypocrite being forsaken of God, his heart shall fail
him, and he will forsake God. Isa. 33. 14. Fearfulness has surprised the
Hypocrites, who amongst us shall dwell with the devouring fire. Mat. 13. 5, 6,
7. Job 27. 9, 10. and 8. 20. Neither will he help the evil doers. Prove. 11. 5.
6. The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall
fall by his own wickedness. Length of days shall be to the Sincere. Prove. 3,
2, 16. But the Hypocrites days shall be shortened. Psalm. 109 8. Let his days
be few, etc. The upright man shall be guided of God in the right and safe way
to everlasting life. Prove. 11. 3. The integrity of the upright shall guide him
(that is) it shall be a star to lead him in a good way, as a guard to keep
watch and ward about him, and make his way passible and prosperous to his
desired end. Ps. 129. 23. But the Hypocrite shall be left to Satan and his own
wickedness, to be carried to destruction as Judas, 22 Luke 3. Mat. 27. 1, 2.
etc. Psalm. 109. 6. Let Satan stand at his right hand. 2 These. 2. 10, 11. The
upright man he shall have much comfort in his death, to remember that he has
been upright before the Lord; yea this will more comfort him then the
remembrance of all his good works (be they never so many and excellent he has
done) Is. 38. 3. Remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked before
thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in
thy sight. And in death the upright man is blessed; for as he has hope, Prove.
14. 32. so commonly he is in good heart, Acts 7. 59. But however he shall have
peace and enter into rest at that day. Ps. 37. 37. Mark the perfect man, and
behold the upright for the end of that man is peace. Isa. 57. 2. He shall enter
into peace, they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.
But with the Hypocrite it shall not be so. And for the life to come, and after
his death the upright man shall be blessed; for he shall stand boldly and
confidently in the last judgment, and lift up his head with joy when Christ
comes. Luke 21. 28. Lift up your heads for your redemption draws nigh. Psalm
49. 14. And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning. When the
Hypocrite shall be cursed; for he being utterly disappointed shall be miserably
ashamed and confounded Psalm. 119. 80. And his hope shall perish and he shall
not be able to stand in the judgment, he shall call to the mountains to cover
him, and run into the holes of the rocks to hide him if it were possible from
the face and wrath of Christ. Rev. 6. 16, 17. Is. 33. 14. The sinners in Sion
are afraid, fearfulness has surprised the Hypocrites, etc. Job 8. 13, 14. And
the Hypocrites hope shall perish, and whose trust shall be as a Spiders webb.
Psalm 1. 5. Job 27. 8. And further the upright man shall be taken up into the
kingdom and glory of Christ to be with him for ever. Mat. 5. 8. Blessed are
the pure in heart for they shall see God. Ps. 37. 18. Their inheritance shall
be for ever. Ps. 50. 23. And to him that orders his conversation aright will
I show the salvation of God. Mat. 25. 34, 36. Psalm. 15. 1, 2, 5. When the
Hypocrite shall be shut out of heaven, and with the workers of iniquity thrust
down into hell for ever. Phil. 3. 18. whose end is destruction. Mat. 25. 1,
10, 11, 12 And the door was shut Afterward came the other Virgins saying,
Lord, Lord, open to us; but he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know
you not. Luke 13. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. and he shall answer and say unto you, I
know you not whence ye are. Then shall ye begin to say, we have eaten and drunk
in thy presence, and thou have taught in our streets. But he shall say, I tell
you I know you not whence you are, depart from me all you workers of iniquity.
There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and
Isaac, and Jacob, and all the Prophets in the kingdom of God, and you your
selves thrust out. Mat 25. 41, 46. And they shall go into everlasting
punishment; and there shall they suffer the vengeance of eternal fire with the
Devil and his Angels, and be shut up in the blackness of darkness, or utter
darkness, and to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever. Jude v. 7. 13.
2 Pet. 2. 17. Mat. 13. 41, 42, 43. The Son of man shall send forth his Angels,
and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which
do iniquity (wherein Hypocrites are especially intended) Mat. 13. 24, 25, etc.
v. 49, 50. And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing
and gnashing of teeth. Psalm 125. 5. And as he is of all sinners the greatest;
for his counterfeit holiness, is (in Gods sight) a double wickedness; so will
his punishment in hell be the greatest. Mat. 23. 14. Therefore ye shall receive
the greater damnation. Job 20. 5. 23, 24, 25. God shall rain down the fury of
his wrath upon him, etc. He shall suck the poison of Asps, the Vipers tongue
shall slay him, etc. God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him. All darkness
shall be hid in his secret places, and fire not blown shall consume him, etc.
This is the portion appointed to such a man by God. And this portion is the
portion of unbelevers, expressed in Ps. 11 6. Upon the wicked he shall rain
snares, fire, and brimstone, and an horrible tempest, this shall be the portion
of their cup, they shall be cut asunder and torn in pieces, there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth. Luke 12. 46. compared with Mat. 24. 51. the Lord
of that servant shall come, etc. and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his
portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Psalm 50. 16. 22. Now consider this ye that forget God, least I tear you in
pieces, and there be none to deliver.

CHAP. XIII.
Arguments to persuade to Sincerity, and against Hypocrisy in Services.

AND now to persuade us to Sincerity in our particular Works and Services,
especially in the service of God, we may take up and use these motives. 1 God
is upright in his work, and all that he does he does in uprightness, and we
are to be followers of God. Ier. 32. 41. And I will plant them, etc. with my
whole heart, and whole soul. Ephesians. 5. 1. Be ye therefore followers of God as
dear children. 2 God requires uprightness in us in all that we do in his
service. Heb. 20 22. Let us draw near with a true heart, etc. Deuteronomy. 10. 12. And
now Israel what does the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord,
etc. and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, 1 Samuel 12. 20. 1 Pet. 1. 2. Love one another with a pure heart fervently. 1 Samuel
12 10. Romans 12. 8, 9. 1 Chr. 28. 9. 3 This sincere service agrees with the
nature of God whom we serve. 1 For he is a Spirit. John 4. 24. God is a spirit,
and must be worshipped in spirit and truth. 2 He is a great King, Mal. 1. 14.
For I am a great king, says the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful* etc.
He is not as man, but as far above man as the heavens are above the earth. Ps.
55. 9. Mal. 1. 6. A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If I
then be a father, where is mine honor, and if I be a master where is my fear,
says the Lord of Hosts unto you. O Priests, that despise my name. Eccles 5. 1,
2. Keep thy foot when thou go into the house of God, etc. For God is in
heaven, and thou upon earth, etc. 4 This is Gospel service, and fit for Gospel
times, and Gospel worshippers; and such service as God does call for. Ioh. 4.
23. The hour comes and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship him in
spirit and truth; for the Father seeks such to worship him. Jer. 24. 7. with
3. 10. Ezekiel. 36. 26, 27. 5 This is the only beautiful and excellent service
where there is an harmony and consent between the soul and the body in the
work. Heb. 11. 4, 6. By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice
than Cain. 6 By this the meanest service may become a glorious work, have much
acceptance and reward from God. Luke 21. 2. the widows two mites. Mat. 10. 42.
And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones, a cup of cold
water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no
wise lose his reward. Exodus 1. 17, 21, 22. Jer. 35. 18, 19. 7 Such are the
services of the true servants of God. 1 These. 2. 3. Ps 119 7. 2 Timothy 2. 22. 8
The services so done only are accepted, and will be rewarded with God. 1 Chronicles.
28. 9. Neh. 13. 14. Ezekiel. 18, 24. 9 For no outward service can, or does please
God, or is accepted with him for it self or the work done, but as it is joined
with sincerity in the inward worship of Faith, and love to God, a desire to
please, and purpose to obey him. Genesis 4. 4. Ps. 51. 16, 17. For thou desire
not sacrifice, etc. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
contrite heart: O God thou will not despise: Isa. 66. 1, 2, 3. But to this man
will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and trembles
at my word. He that kills an ox, etc. Hosea 8. 13. and 9. 4. Amos 5. 21.
Micah 6. 7, 8. Heb: 11. 4. 10 The Hypocritical service is a lie, and a lie not
to men so much as to God. Hosea 11. 12. Ephraim compasses me about with lies,
etc. Acts 5. 3. 11 The Hypocritical service albeit it be not despised by men,
yet God does know it, and will make it known to others, to the shame of him
that does it. 1 Chr. 28. 9. And then Solomon know thou the God, etc. and serve
him with a perfect heart, etc. for the Lord searches all hearts, and
underst^^deth all the imaginations of the thoughts, etc. Mat. 6. 5, 6. Mat. 19.
29. with Ps. 44. 21, 22. And it is not only not accepted, but slighted of
God, it being a grievous sin, a pollution and profanation of Gods name, it is
a provocation of his wrath, and does draw down grievous judgments upon men
that do so perform it. Mal. 1. 7. 13. 14. Should I accept this, says the
Lord, etc. But cursed be the deceiver which has in his flock a male and voweth
and sacrifices unto the Lord a corrupt thing. Lev. 10. 8. Ezekiel. 23. 38. Numb
18. 32.

Ob. But here may be objected, that hypocritical service has had a reward? 2
Kings 11. 18, 19, 20. 1 Kings 17. 18, etc 27, 28, 29. 2 Kings 10. 14, 15. etc.

Ans. It cannot be denied but that God may and sometimes does give for an
outward hypocritical service for the work done (because it is that he would
have done) a temporal reward. But this will not at all preserve him from the
punishment of the hypocrisy of his service here, nor help to prevent the
eternal punishment that will unavoidably come upon him for it hereafter. Mat.
6. 5, 6. and 23. 33. 2 King. 10. 14, etc. compared with Hosea 1. 4.

CHAP. XIV.
Means or helps to get and keep Sincerity.

IF any now shall desire and will labor for sincerity, and would know by what
means he may get and keep it, and prevent hypocrisy. We answer by these
following means. 1. Let him labor to be sincere in his state in general, for
till this, it cannot be expected he should do any thing in sincerity. 2. Let
him labor to get the Spirit of God into his heart and by this to get a
newheart a heart convinced of sin by the work of the Law. Jo. 16. 7, 8, 9, 10.
And drawn to Christ by faith, and so to become one with him, and made a new
creature, for no man can otherwise be sincere, And he that is in Christ is
and must be so a new creature as soon as he is in him. Jo. 1. 12. 2 Cor. 5.
17. And when there is a full and powerful change of the whole man by the grace
of God, then, and not till then does he begin to be sincere. For every man's
heart naturally is deceitful above all things, and till God has changed it
there is no integrity in it, and a man's heart is never plain and even till it
be polished by grace for till this be, a man makes himself the center, and all
lines to meet in him. Then he will have the clean and right Spirit that David
prays for. Ps. 51. 10. Ephesians. 4. 23. and 3. 19. Phill. 3. 9. 3. Let him get
an understanding heart of the things of God, for without knowledge the heart
cannot be good, without this there can be no fear of, nor love to, nor trust
in God Prove. 19. 2. 1 Chronicles. 28. 9. And thou Solomon know thou the God of thy
father and serve him with a perfect heart. etc. Prove. 15. 23. A man of
understanding walks uprightly. Prove. 2. 10. Phill 1. 9, 10. And this I pray
that your love may abound in knowledge etc. That ye may be sincere etc. Psalm.
36. 10. and 9. 10. Jo. 10. 38. 4. Let him labor for unfeined faith which is
ever accompanied, with and never severed from Sincerity. 1 Timothy 1. 5. 2 Timothy
1. 5, 7. 5. Let him labor from the sense of Gods love to him to get, and
increase in an unfeined love to God, which will make him sincere. Psalm. 26. 1,
2. I have walked in mine integrity, for thy loving kindness is before mine
eyes. 1 Jo. 4. 19. 2 Cor. 6. 6. 6. Let him labor much in the mortification of
his lusts, and especially in his lusts of coveteousnes for this inclines a man
to hypocrisy. Luke. 6. 14. And the Pharisees also who were Coveteous heard all
these things, and they derided him. Mat. 26. 9. Jo. 12. 4, 5, 6. Romans 8 13.
Coll. 3. 5. And for the better doing and attainment of all these things. 1. Let
him think much of God, his omnipresence, and omniscience, the fearful
judgments to come upon hypocrites. And let the fear of these judgments take
hold of him Prove. 14. 2. He that walks in his uprightnes fears the Lord. 2 Samuel 22. 24. For all his judgments were before me etc. I was also upright etc.
1 Chronicles. 28. 9. Know thou the God etc. and serve him with a perfect heart, for
the Lord searches all hearts etc. Job. 31. 4, 23. Does he not see my ways
and count all my steps, Psalm. 50. 21, 22. Thou thoughtest I was altogether such
an one as thy self but I will reprove thee etc. Consider this ye that forget
God, least he tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver you. Mal. 1.
6, 7, 8, 9. Psalm. 139. 1, 2. 2. Let him keep a narrow watch over his heart and
the motions thereof, the principles, motives, intentions and ends of every
thing that passes thorough it. Pro. 4. 23. Keep thy heart with all diligence,
for out of it are the Issues of life. Mark 13. 37. Psalm. 134. 24. 8. Let him
pray and pray much and earnestly for them to God who gives them. Ier. 24. 7.
And who has promised this very thing. Ezech. 11. 19. I will give them one
heart etc. And put a new Spirit within you. etc. James. 1. 5. If any man want
wisdom etc. Let him ask of God. Mat. 5. 42. Ask and ye shall have. Phill.
1. 9, 10. And this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in
knowledge and in all judgment etc. That ye may be sincere etc. Luke 11. 13.
1 Chronicles. 29. 19. Psalm. 139. 24. Acts. 8. 23. Psalm. 119. 80. Let my heart be
sound in thy statutes. etc. 4. Let him be much in converse with Gods word. And
especially with these scriptures we have in this work proposed, for a
preservative from, and cure of this disease. This will be as a rule to the
Mason in his work; yea the Word will not only discover crookedness, but amend
it, and make a man strait: 1 Samuel 22. 23, 24. I have kept the ways of the
Lord, etc. And as for his statutes I did not depart from them: I was also
upright before him. Ps. 119. 11. Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might
not sin against thee. v. 7. I shall praise thee with uprightness of heart when
I shall learn thy righteous judgments. Prove. 15. 21. and 2. 10. 5 Let him
labor to remove out of his heart all low and undervaluing thoughts, and get
and cherish a high value and esteem of God, his Ordinances and Institutions.
Mal. 1. 1, 2. 6. 14. etc. 6 Let him take heed of harkening to carnal wisdom
either that which comes from a carnal fountain, or that which inclines to, or
produces the works of the flesh, or that which rules only for fleshly
motives and carnal ends. 2 Cor. 1. 12. James 3. 13. 7 Let him decline the
company of such who give vehement cause to be suspected to be Hypocrites. For
he that touches pitch will be defiled therewith. And get into the company, and
call in help from the prayers and counsel of them that appear to be sincere.
Prove. 13. 20. He that walks with the wise shall be wise.

We have now done and said all we have to say. There remains that only
which we have promised to be added by another hand to the clearing of what we
have in our fourth Chapter touching this Question, Whether the Saving Grace lie
in the Quality or Quantity, Nature or Degree thereof, or not.

CHAP. XVI.
Sr,
YOu were pleased to require my opinion in that Question, Whether the
difference between common and special (or saveing) grace be specificall, or
only graduall? and also what I thought of M. Baxters discourse concerneing that
particular. Now although it signify little what my opinion is, and although I
am unwilling to censure any man's positions, or proofs of them (especially M.
Baxters, whom I highly esteem for his learning and industry, his moderation and
ingenuity) yet in obedience to your command, without any further Apology or
preface (taking the same liberty to judge of other men's discourses, which I
freely give all men to judge of mine) I shall crave leave to tell you

1. That I believe the difference to be more the^ graduall.

2. That M. Baxters discourse does not concludingly evince the contrary.

Now that this may not be gratis and precario Dictum, I shall.

1. Set down M. Baxters reasons.

2. That which (to me) seems a solution, and just answer of them.

Obj. 1. To prove that Common and special grace differ only gradually, he
reasons thus M. Baxters Saints everlasting rest. page 225. etc.
Is not common knowledge and special knowledge, common belief and special
belief, all knowledge and belief? is not belief the same thing in one and
another, though but one saveinge? our understandings and wills are physically
the same, of the like substance, and an Act, and an Act are accidents of the
same kind, and we suppose the object the same; common love to God, and special
love to God, are both Acts of the same will. etc.

Sol. That I may give a just answer to this discourse, and withal state the
Question, and give you the reasons and proofs of my former positions with more
evidence and perspicuity, I consider.

Consid. 1. That by grace in this Question we mean something inherent in us
(be what it will, Act or disposition, or habit or any other quality whatsoever)
and therefore the favor and love of God to his people (commonly called grace
in Scripture) comes not now into consideration. 1. Because the graces we now
speak of, are properly (...), dona gratuit^, the gracious effects of Gods love
and favor, such as are subjective, inherent in us; whereas the favor and love
of God, is Subjective in Deo, and terminative only in us, as it produces good
and gracious effects in us. 2. Because the grace of God in this notion (as it
signifies his love to us) is not capable of any degrees: the love of God (as
all other acts of the divine nature, being like God himself, absolutely simple
without any composition, essential or graduall.

Consid. 2. By grace in this Question we must understand (...), do^u^ aliquod
homini in esse constituto superadditum, something superadded to a man's being,
which he has by grace, not by nature. For seeing all the grace we now speak of,
is do^u^ gratuitu^ homini datum, therefore it is supposed a man has his
natural being before he receave this grace. For Titius and Sempronius must
necessarily be supposed to be men, before they can have any (...) bestowed on
them, to make them gracious men: every gift presupposing the being, and the
existence of the person to whom it is given. Whence it follows, that our bodies
and sonles, our natural powers and faculties (as understanding and will) and
the acts of them which naturally flow from these faculties, none of these
simply and properly are, or can be called graces: Seeing all of the^ are
natural, and by grace in this Question, we (and all men else) generally
understand, Aliquid naturae superadditum, some addition to our natural
perfections: The reason, and use of this Consideration, will further appear
anon.

Consid. 3. When it is said. Onr understandings and wills are physically the
same, of the same substance and an Act, and an Act are Accidens of the same
kind. etc. To this I say. 1. That this assertion (as it is here expressed) is
evidently untrue for our understanding and will are so far from being the same
in specie, (for that is the Samenesse meant) that all who know any thing almost
in Philosophy, or School. Divinity know thus much, that it is the Vid Aquin.
Part. 1. Quaest. 77. 78, 79, 80, 82. and Co^mentatores ejus seqnaces, and
vindices.
general received opinion, that they are two distinct species, or two natural
faculties of the soul specifically distinct. So that as Intellectus humanus
is a faculty of the rational soul specifically distinct from all other
faculties, comprehending under it, hunc and illum intellecium. So Voluutas
humana is a distinct faculty Or species in ordine ad hanc and illam voluntatem.
2. But if by these words [Our understandings, and wills are physically the
same] this be meant, that the understandings of all men in the world are
specifically the same, and the wills of all men in the world are so too; This
is granted, as evidently true. For facultas Intellectiva in all men, wise and
foolish, and facultas volitiva in all men good or bad, is specifically the
same. So that the understanding and will of a Saint and Sinner, of an Hypocrite
and Regenerat person, do not at all differ specifically. Nay, not only so,
but the wills and understandings of all mankind, whether here, or in hell, or
heaven (even our blessed Saviors understanding and will) are of the same
species. But then. 3. It must be considered, that this makes nothing to the
present purpose, nor any way proves that Common and sav^ing graces differ not
specifically. For 1 The Will and Understanding being Natural faculties of the
soul neither are, nor congruously can be called graces, as appears by the 2d.
Consideration above. For what is natural, necessary, and universal. So that
it is equally in every Individuum of that species in which it is, Naturae donum
est, non Gratiae; Adjunctum necessarium, non gratuitum. 2. Yet if the will and
understanding were Graces, they are not capable of any degrees (Potentiae
naturales non habent magis and minus, is a known Axiom in the Schools of
Philosophers and Divines toe) So that although the will and understanding of all
me^ be specifically the same, yet this signifies nothing, but is wholly
impertinent as to the present purpose.

Consid. 4. When it is said -- Is not common belief and special belief,
common knowledge and special knowledge, all knowledge and belief? Is not
belief the same thing in one and another, though but one saveing? I answer,
yes: it is most certain that all belief is belief, and all knowledge is
knowledge. But then. 2. Quid hoc ad Iphieli Bones? Will it hence follow, that
all belief, and all knowledge are specifically the same? may not all
knowledge, be knowledge, and all belief belief, and yet knowledge and
knowledge, belief and belief be specifically distinct? Yes, it is evident they
may. The demonstrative knowledge of Arithmetique, and Geometry, the artificial
knowledge of a Tailor or Shoemaker, the supernatural knowledge of God in Jesus
Cbrist, wrought in the heart of true beleivers by the holy Ghost, all these (I
say) are vinvocally knowledge, and yet I believe none will, (sure I am none
truly can) say, that all these are specifically the same knowledge, and differ
only gradually. 2. But if any should say otherwise, I shall desire him to
consider.

1. That the knowledge of God in Jesus Christ (I mean the knowledge of him by a
lively faith) wrought in the heart of a true beleiver by the holy Ghost, is a
divine knowledge (and ratione principii a quo, and objecti in quod tendit) the
other but humane. And I believe none will say such knowledges are only
gradually distinct: especially if it be considered 1. that not only their
objects, but the principles too whence they come, are as far different, as
heaven and earth. 2. That they have far different Acts; the one being a
gracious sanctifying Act, the other not: the one such as may be in any wicked
person, nay and actually is in the Devil himself for I doubt not, but
notwithstanding all his badnesse, he may be (and is) a good Mathematition)
whereas the other never is, nor can be in any but a regenerate person. 3. Were
there only a graduall difference, then the humane, and (as is supposed) the
less knowledge, might be improved into a Divine and saveing knowledge, by
addition of further degrees. But this is absolutely impossible; for let our
knowledge in Geometry, or Arithmerique (for instance) be improved to the
utmost, as high as there is any possibility of knowing those objects, yet they
can never come to be Divine, and sanctifying, or saveing knowledge, but remain
still barely humane, natural, or artificial cognitions, as is evident, and I
think, will not be denied.

Consid. 5. When it is said -- That the understanding, and the will are
physically the same, of the like substance, and an Act, and an Act are
Accidents of the same kind, and common love to God and special love to God are
acts of the same will. etc.

I Answer. 1. That the expression sin this paragraph are very improper and
incongruous. 1. Because the will and understanding cannot in any
Philosophical, or Logical propriety of speech be called like substances,
seeing they are not substances at all, but Accidents 2. Because (admit by
substances their natures or essences be meant, yet) to say they are physically
the same (in nature, and substance) and then in the next words, that they are
of like substance, is to say their natures are the same, and their natures are
like one another: which is indeed to say things which are (...), and
inconsistent. For if they be of the same substance and nature, then they are
not of the like nature and substauce: for sure the old rule in Logique is still
true, Nullum simile est idem. 3. But it being granted (as it is that the
understanding, and will in several men (as in hypocrites and regenerate
persons) are not specifically distinct, yet it neither does, nor can follow,
but their acts may, and that even about the same object. So the same man may
(at several times) love God, and hate him: now (in this case) those two Acts
of love and hate are acts of a Will specifically (nay numerically) the same,
and yet the Acts themselves are not so, but specifically different: the one
being an act of virtue, the other of vice, the one actus prosecutionis, the
other actus fugae, and aversationis; the one a fulfilling, the other a
violation of the law, Further. 4. I am sure it is not only a graduall
difference. 1. Because actus prosecutionis, and fugae, differ more then
gradually. 2. Those acts may be in the same degree, as they are physically
considered, as if Titius (which is possible) should love God in the same degree
now, in which he hated him before: And therefore two acts of the same will, and
degree, may be specifically distinguished, and so it will not follow, that
because the will from whence they flow^ ^s specifically the same, therefore the
Acts of it are so too. 5. The same may be said of loveing and hateing the same
sin, at several times, in the same degree, or any volition and nolition of the
same object, in the same person: which are acts of a will specifically, (nay
numerically) the same, and yet the Acts themselves specifically different.

Consid. 6. When it is said, That the Acts, and exercise of common and special
grace differ only in degree and so the difference between common and special
grace is only graduall, and not specificall I conceave (with a willing, and
humble submission to better judgments) that this position is not true, nor
consistent with the just, and known principles of Divinity, or true Philosophy
My reasons for this assertion are these, and such like.

1. I suppose actions evangelically good, and well pleasing to God, may differ
specifically sometimes: as an Act of saveing faith, and an Act of true charity,
do differ specifically, though both of them evangelically good, and
well-pleasing to God. Sometimes they may differ only gradually, as having
several degrees of perfection within the same species. As the least measure
and degree of true justifying faith, ('it is evident that such faith is capable
of degrees) differ from the strongest saveing belief only in degrees. For,
bonum and bonum in eadem specie (numericall distinction in this case come not
into consideration) cannot possibly differ more than gradually. But now acts of
common grace in hypocrites, and irregnerate persons differ more then so, from
acts of special grace in the regenerate. For it is certain, that Bonum and
bonum in eadem specie, neither do, nor can differ so much as Bonum and malum.
There being manifestly a greater repugnancy between good and evil, then
between two good things only gradually different: these standing in a natural
subordination the one to the other, the lesser degree to the greater, which
when it comes consists with the less degree, and perfects it. But those stand
in a direct and formal opposition, good and evil being inconsistent, and
naturally destructive of each other. As a greater, and lesser degree of heat
(in a natural way) will agree well enough, whereas heat and cold are
incompatible. Isay bonum and bonum in eadem specie, differ not so much as bonum
and malum: but acts of common grace in hypocrites, and saveing grace in the
regenerate, are such: the Acts of saveing grace being evangelically good, and
well pleasing to God, the Acts of common grace in hypocrites and unregenerate
persons not so, being neither evangelically good, nor well pleasing to God. For
what outward speciousness soever they may have, yet when (all circumstances are
considered) they are examined by the rules of the law, and Gospel, it is certain
they are, and ever will be found only Splendida peccata (as the Father calls
them) Splendida perhaps, yet peccata, and so not pleasing to God. And this
seems to me evident enough.

1. Because, without faith it is impossible to please God. And therefore those
acts of common grace in hypocrites (who have not such saving faith as the
Apostle there speaks of) are not pleasing unto God, nor Evangelically good.

2. Hypocrites, and irregenerate persons are not (in the sense of the Gospel)
good trees, and therefore cannot bring forth gaod fruit. They are thistles, on
which you may (in vain) seek figs, but shall never find any. They are
crabtrees, and though they may bear a fair promiseing fruit, which may much
resemble an apple, yet when you come to taste, and try it, you will soon see by
the sowerness, it is no such thing.

3. Hypocrites, and irregenerate persons, are (if we will belive the Gospel) in
the flesh, carnally minded, and have not the spirit of Christ: and the same
Gospel tells us, that Romans 8. 5.
they that are in the flesh mind the things of the flesh and so Romans 8. 7.
are enemies to God, in Romans 8. 6.
a deadly and damnable condition, such a condition, in which they Romans 8. 8.
cannot please God. Which appears further, because while we are irregenerate,
we are Col. 2. 13. Ephesians. 2. 1, 2, 5, 12.
spiritually dead in sins, and have no spiritual life (much less the Acts, and
exercise of it) for that we have solely 1 John 5. 12. Joh. 15. 4, 5.
from Christ and his spirit. Whence it seems to me to follow, that the Acts of
common grace in irregenerate persons are not, cannot be pleasyng to God, and
evangelically good: and therefore the Acts of saveing grace in the regenerate,
being really and evangelically good, and well pleasing to God, differ from them
more then gradually.

2. I desire it may be considered, that is is (and upon evident reason) M.
Baxters Saints everlasting rest. page 225.
confessed that the Acts of common and special grace (as they are morally
considered) differ specifically, and not only in degrees: whence it follows;
that when the Question is put, How common and special grace differ? the
Answer must ever be affirmative, that they differ Specie, Non gradu solum. The
reason is, because the Acts of the will, and understanding are saveing graces
in their moral consideration only, and in no other consideration whatsoever.
And therefore if in their moral consideration they still differ specifically
from common graces, it can never (with any congruity) be affirmed, that in any
other consideration they differ only gradually. For instance, when it is said,
that in their natural, and physical consideration they differ only in
degrees. I reply, that the Acts of the will, and understanding in that
consideration, are not saveing graces at all; and therefore, if it be granted,
that in that consideration, they differ only gradually; yet it will not thence
follow, that common and special graces differ only in degrees, such acts of
the Will, and Understanding, So considered, being no graces at all. For this
Argument [common and special belief as they are physically considered, differ
only gradually go. Common and special graces differ only gradually] In
plain English is no more then this. [Things which are no graces at all differ
only gradually, ergo. Common and special graces differ only in degrees.] Now
this latter argument being an illogical nonsequitur, the former, (which is
really the same) must be so toe. Now that those Acts of the will and
udderstanding (saveing faith, and saveing love) as they are physically
considered, are no saveing graces at all, will (if I mistake not) appear.

1. By what is said in the second consideration above.

2. Because saveing love and belief, are special and saveing graces only in
a moral consideration, as is confessed by that M. Baxter in his Saints
everlasting Rest. page 226.
reverend, and learned person, against whose hypothesis we now reason. Who
tells us, (and most truly) that those acts of our wills, and understandings,
are graces and virtues formaly in relation to the Law only, and their
conformity with it; and saveing graces in relation to the promise of God, who
has promised salvation upon such conditions. Now this is a Moral
consideration of them, and not natural; for so it follows in that pious and
Learned Author -- The promise gives not salvation to the Act considered in its
MERE being, and NATVRALL Sincerity, but to the Act as suited with its object
in its essential respects. That is in plainer English, these Acts are not
saveing graces in their physical consideration, but in their moral, as they
carry a conformity with the precept, and promise. So that he that says, common
and saveing graces are specifically distinct in their moral confideration,
says they are absolutely, and only so distinguished, because they are saveing
graces in no consideration but that.

Consid 8. It is to be considered, that common and special graces consist not
so properly, and primarily in the Acts, and exercise of faith and love etc. As
in the habits, and principle from whence they come: So that the gratiousness
which is in them (as Suares, and some others tell us) is not, ipsis actibus
originaliter intrinseca, sed a principio, and habitu unde fluunt derivata. For
instance, the gratiousnesse of our actual faith or love does not consist so
much in the substance, and nature of the Act physically considered, (which is
the natural product of the natural faculty from whence it flows) as in the
circumstance, the modus, and measure of it, from which its goodness, and
conformity with the Law arises, and this it has from the principle, and habit
from whence it flows. For as the habit is more intense or remiss, more
perfect or imperfect, So proportionably is the Act which proceeds from it. It Is
true, to believe, or love, or hate (if simply considered, quoad substantiam
actus) are natural effects, and physical products of our will, and
understanding, such as those faculties can, (and many times do) produce
without the help of any habit, But if the manner, and measure of those Acts be
considered (that we believe, or love modo debito, with facility, cheerfullness,
and constancy) this (in which the gratiousness of the Act consists) they owe to
the habits, or graces superadded to the faculties, and natural powers from
whence they proceed.

2. And as the habits are (common or special) graces in order of nature
allways, and mostly in order of time before the Acts (these being the effects
of those) So they are far more consisting, and permanent. The acts are so
transitory and vanishing, that a little sleep, or sowneing, an inadvertency of
that buisinesse about which we are, or intention of other buisinesse, robbs us
of them: but the habits are more fixed and permanent in their inherence and
denomination. So that from them men are called (and are) truly gracious, even
when they have no Act of grace to give them that denomination; otherwise we
should (when we go to sleep) put of our graces with our clothes, and he that
was a gracious man now, immediately be none.

Seeing then that habits do prins and principalius denominate us gracious,
therefore they are more properly and principally to be esteemed (common or
special) graces: and then it seems to me to follow, that he that inquires,
whether common and special graces differ specifically, or only gradually,
should (if he will rationally proceed) first, and principally inquire
concerneing the habits of common and special grace, and then secondarily
concerneing the Acts, and exercise of those habits. The reason is.

1. Because the Acts have their gratiousnesse from the habits, but not
(Viceversa) the habits from the Acts, and go the Acts cannot possibly be known
distinctly, and a priori till we know the habits from whence those Acts (as
from their cause) do proceed.

2. Because if it do appear that the habits differ specifically, then it will
evidently follow, that the Acts do so too: seeing it is impossible, that those
Acts should differ only gradually, which proceed from habits, specifically
distinct.

Consid. 9. So that we are now come to the prime hinge and foundation of this
controversy, to inquire how the habit of saveing grace differs from those we
call common graces? And here I shall give you,

1. A Position. 2. The proof of it.
Posit. 1. The Position is this -- The Habits of special and saveing grace are
not only gradually, but specifically distinct from the habits, and Acts of all
common grace whatsoever.

2. For the more methodicall, and manifest demonstration of this position, I
shall proceed by these steps, and degrees;

Rat. 1. Principalis. 1. There are many Common graces (dona extraordinaria
gratuita) which are inherent in the body, and properly corporeal. As (for in
stance) the extraordinary great strength of Sampso^, the beauty of Absalom.
etc. Now for such common graces as these, I shall take it for granted that they
differ more then only in degree from the habits of saveing faith, and charyty,
and such other Sanctifying graces. For as no man (that I know of) did ever
affirm them to be specifically the same with those special graces, so
rationally none can. They being manifestly not in the same, but several
species of Quality.

Rat. 2. There are many common graces of the Soul, which facilitate and enable
us in the distinct knowledge, and comprehension of natural things; sometimes
immediately, and extraordinarity infused by God, as the great, and vast
knowledge of Solomon, and his comprehension of the natures of things, from the
Hyssope on the wall, to the Cedar on Libanus, (in the phrase of Scripture.)
Sometimes acquired by the help of natural ingenuity, industry, art, and
education, (with Gods blessing thereupon) and such other natural, and
temporal advantages, as some have, most want: And of this sort (I suppose) was
the very great knowledge of natural things, which was in Plato, Aristotle,
Hyppocrates, Galen. etc. Now such knowledge as this (though a common grace) I
take to be more then gradually distinct, from saveing, and sanctifying
knowledge, such as the knowledge of God by a lively faith enlightening, and
sanctifying our souls. This I take to be evident, and therefore shall not go
about to prove it. For as no man can (without strange confidence, to say no
worse) so (I believe) no man will deny it.

Rat. 3. Faith of miracles in a common grace, which differs from special, and
saveing faith more then gradually. This (I think) will be evident enough, to
any who will (without prejudice or partiality) seriously consider the great,
and more then graduall difference between them. for

1. They differ ratione Principii, the habit of saveing faith being ever an
effect of the Spirit of Adoption, the Spirit of Christ workeing regeneration,
and a new life in us: the faith of miracles not so. Which many times may, and
de facto has been in those who never had the regenerating Spirit of Christ in
them. I know well, (and deny not) that both these effects are from the same 1
Cor. 12. 9, 10. etc.
spirit, materially and absolutely considered, so that the spirit is the same
principium materiale of both; but under a several reason, and formality, which
makes them several formal principles, enough to distinguish the effects that
flow from them. For the giveing of saveing faith is an Act of the spirit of
Christ within, and graciously dwelling in his Saints: not so the giveing of the
faith of miracles to sinners (of which we now speak) For in the usual phrase
of Romans 8. 9. John 14. 16. 17.
Scripture, the spirit is said to be, and dwell in the regenerate, in such a
peculiar way as he is not in any wicked person. So that the giveing of saveing
faith is, actus spiritus interne regenerantis; the giveing of the faith of
miracles, is Actus externe, gubernantis. The giveing of saveing faith is an Act
of special love to that person to whom such faith is given; but the giveing of
miraculous faith to wicked men (for to such it is many times given) is an Act
of his love to others, rather then such person to whom it is given. Faith of
miracles, being one of those gratiae gratis datae, which the Vid. Becanum in
Summa Theologiae Scholast. part 2 Tractat. 4. cap. 1.. 4. page 719. and

wicked man, even in one who continues so till death, and is damned. This is
not only true, but confessed even by the Popish writers (who have otherwise
little reason to do it, making miracles a note of the true Church) so Mart.
Delrio Disp. M^gicarum lib. 2 and Quaest. 7.
Martinus Delrio, A malis etiam, and perperam de fide sentientibus, nonnunquam
miracula edita fuisse constat. and Maldonate tell us, that (Chrysostom,
Hierome, Euthymius, and Theophylact. Maldonat. in Math. cap. 7. v. 21. etc.
Vid. Socrat. Hist. lib. 7. cap. 17. page 744. de Paul^ Novatiano Episcopo.

page 41. C.
Tolet goes a little further, and says -- Daemones multa posse facere supra
humanas vires, quae miracula videantur, and Aliquando SINT. A miracolous faith
then may be in wicked men, even while they continue so, but it is manifest
justifying faith cannot. 2. Justifying faith may be where faith of miracles
never was, nor will be, (for all just persons, cannot work miracles and ergo
they differ more then in degrees, or as a disposition and a habit. For although
a disposition may be where the habit is not (being always preexistent to it)
yet it is impossible the habit should ever be where the disposition is not, the
habit necessarily presupposeing, and intrinsecally including the disposition,
as Calidum in gradu 6. includes Calidum in 4. gradu.

3. They differ Ratione sui. Faith that we call special, and saveing,
Sanctifies and Justifies that person in which it is, faith of miracles Aquinas
calls it gratia gratis data, benorum and malorum communis. 2. 2. Quaest. 178.
in Axi^mate Art. 1. Praefixo.
does not so. 2. Saveing faith is premanent, and perpetual, the faith of
miracles is not so.

4. They differ ratione adjuncti, saveing faith is ever joined with true
charity, as its natural effect, and inseparable concomitant, but faith of
miracles may want it; as is manifest, by Math. 7. 22.
that of the Gospel, where though some had cast out Devils, and done great
miracles in our Saviors name, yet our Savior calls them WORKERS OF INIQVITY,
and tells them, HE NEVER KNEW THEM. Never, (...). Theophytact. in Math. 7. page

he never loved them, (as Theophylact on the place) or Grotius in locu^ Non novi
Vos (i. e.) Notitia approbationis. Lyranus in loc.
owned them for his. And ergo (to be sure) they had no true charity, for had
they loved him, he would have shown more love to them. 2. The 1 Cor. 13. 2.

in. 1 Cor. 13, 2.
Apostle (if he speak de re possibili, (as most probably he does) evidently
shows that the highest degree of miraculous faith may be without charity, and
ergo true love, and saveing charity is no necessary concomitant of the faith of
miracles, though it be in the highest degree, eve^ in him that has ALL FAITH So
that he can remove Mountains.

5. They differ Ratione Actus, for. 1. the Act of saveing faith justifies, and
sanctifies that person who is so happy as to have it, but the faith of miracles
does not so. 2. The act of saveing faith is immanent, terminated within the
subject in which it is, without any operation ad extra, produceing any effect
in any other subject. But the act of faith of miracles is transient (in this
respect) terminated ad extra, and workeing miraculous effects in other bodies
besides that in which it is: As when Paul by his faith of miracles raised the
dead, or gave sight to the blind, etc. Saveing faith gives Spiritual sight to
his eyes in whom it is, but that of miracles gives corporal sight to others.

6. They differ ratione objecti, for justifying faith is an assent to the whole
Gospel (so far as it is sufficiently revealed) whereby we believe not only
Christ's power, but his gracious promises, and precepts too; judgeing them to
be just and good, not only in themselves, but to us; as the best, (and only)
means to bring us to heaven. So that the understanding illuminated by faith,
sees such an excellency in Jesus Christ, in his promises, and praecepts, and
beleives it so absolutely, (though sometimes with infirmity, more or less
according to the measure of faith) that in comparison of them, all other things
are but Phil. 3. 9.
(...), (sordescunt reliqua) Vile, and contemptible. whence follows the
obedience of faith, always accompanied with M. Baxter Aphoris, of
Justificatio^. Aphorism 69. page 261. and 262. etc.
sincerity, though not with a perfect integrity: that being only to be hoped
for here, and had hereafter, desired and labored for in via, but possessed in
Patria. But now (to subsume) the Faith of miracles Vid. Joh. Calv. in 1 Cor.
13. 2. Mart. Becanum in Summa Theol. Scholast. part. 2. Tract. 4. cap. 2.
Quaest. ^. page 802.
Non comprehendit totum Christum, sed tantum potentiam in edendis miraculis. So
that the faith of miracles includes an assent to these. 3. Propositions.

1. Quod Deus possit, that by his power he can produce miraculous effects.

2. Quod velit fide miraculosa in se credemibus affari, That (in thesi) he will
be present, and assist those which (by such a miraculous faith) depend upon him.

3. In hypothesi, that he will particularly assist me in the working such a
miracle.

Now for the first of these, that he can work miraculous effects, all
Christians, (nay all men, by the principles, and light of nature) know, because
they believe and know, he is omnipotent. 2. For the second: That (in thesi) in
the general, he will assist all those which (by such a miraculous faith)
believe in him, Christians know by the general Math. 17. 20. Luke 17. 6. John.
14. 12. etc.
promises in the Gospel. 3. But that he will assist Peter, or Paul, Titius,
or Semproniu^, you or me in workeing miracles, this does, and of necessity must
depend on Vid. Jac. ad Portum Bernatem in Defens. Fidei Orthodoxae contra
Christoph. Ostorrodium. cap. 30. page 377.
particular revelatio^. All faith must depend upon authority, and divine faith
(such as this of miracles is) on divine authority: now because this miraculous
faith is not (...), such a faith as is common to all beleivers (thousands of
Gods Saints having it not even in the primitive times, and (may be none now)
(...), (as Gennadius apud Oecumenium. in 1 Cor. 13. 2. page 465. Edit. Graecae.
Veron. 1532.
Gennadius tells us) or, (...), Vid. Fred. Baldwinum in. 1 Cor. 13. page 687.
Philip. Melancthon. and Tileman. Heshusium ibidem.
donum particulore (as Calvin, and Reformed Divines generally call it) (...)
(as Chrysostom, and the Greek Scholia) Fides particularis, a faith
particularly relying on the revelation of Gods power, and willingness to work
miracles, and that in some persons only, and at some times: and therefore this
faith has a far different object from a true justisying faith. Now then he
that seriously considers, that faith of miracles differs from saveing faith all
these ways, that is, 1 In its principle. 2. Its subject. 3. It self. 4. Its
Adjunct. 5. Its Acts. 6. Its Object (all the ways almost two Habits can differ
in) such a one (I say) will have little reason to think that they differ only
in degrees.

2. Further, if saveing faith and that of miracles differ only in degree, or
as a disposition and an Habit, then I demand which is the Habit, and the higher
degree? If it be said that saveing faith is the higher degree, and so the
Habit, and faith of miracles the lower degree, as a Disposition: then it
evidently follows, that who ever has justifying faith has that of Miracles
too; (which is manifestly untrue) for it is certain (and will not be denied by
any who understands Philosophy, or Scholasticall Divinity) that when two
Qualities differ only in degree, then that in the higher degree intrinsecally
includes that in the lower degree (and by consequence all the virtue, and
natural or moral activity of it) so an habit necessarily includes the
disposition^ as Calor ad. 8. Necessarily presupposes, and includes Calor in
gradu. 6. So that what ever (...) in gradu. 6. can do, that (caeteris paribus)
and something more, may be done by Calor in gradu. 8. And what ever he can do,
that has only the disposition of fortitude, that and some thing more may be
done by him that has the habit. And ergo. If the faith of miracles differ only
in degree from saveing faith, and this be the higher degree, includeing that of
miracles, it will evidently follow, that whoever has saveing faith, has the
faith of miracles too; and then miracles will be so far from ceaseing, that we
shall have as many workers of miracles, as men that saveingly believe. But this
is evidently untrue, and ergo that.

2. If saveing faith be the higher degree, and the habit, and include faith of
miracles as the lesser degree, and a disposition; So that whosoever has saveing
faith, has that of miracles too: How came it to pass that our Math. 10. 1.
Luke 9. 1.
Savior gives the Apostles power to do miracles after they were called, and
(without doubt) saveingly believed? Then (says the Text, which was a good
while after their calling, and beleiveing) he called the 12. and gave them
power over all devils, and to cure diseases. If saveing faith include that of
miracles, as a lesser degree, then they had this power before, so that it had
been needless, and nugatory to give them now, what they had before. And if
they had not that power before (as most certainly they had not, seeing it was
given them then) then faith of miracles is not included in saveing faith as the
less degree. If it be said that faith of miracles is the higher degree, as an
habit, (which only remains to be said by him who holds they differ only in
degree) and so includes justifying faith as the lower degree, and a
disposition; then whoever has the faith of miracles, has saveing faith too,
which is evidently untrue: as may appear by what is above said, and indeed is
confessed (as of necessity it must) by all sober Divines, (who for ends, and
interest, are not resolved upon their Conclusions, in despite of Premimises,
out of which number I exclude Becanus in summa Theol. Scholasticae. part. 2.

far from differing only in degree from saveing faith, that there is almost,
(...), scarce any similitude, or common attribute wherein they agree This (at
present) I shall take for granted, and not so much as endeavor to prove it, for
I believe no considering Protestant will deny it.

Rat. 5. Pricip. 5. The greatest difficulty seems to be between temporary, or
common faith in hypocrites, and saveing or special faith in the Elect, whether
these differ only gradually (as is pretended) or also specifically? for my
more methodicall and rational cleareing of this, I shall (before I come to the
proof of the point) add these considerations.

1. Then by common faith in Hypocrites, we do not mean Fides (...), or (...)
only; such a faith as is dissembled, and only pretended to, (for hypocrites
many times pretend to have that, which indeed they have not) without any
reality within: but we mean such a faith as really includes Notitiam, and
assensum, a real (such as it is) knowledge, and assent to diverse Divine and
Ghospell-truthes; such as (we confess) may be (and many times are) in
Hypocrites.

2. This common says (upon those Parables in the Math. 13. 5, 6, 20, 21. Luke
8. 6. Mat. 4. 5, 16, 17.
Ghospel) Divines call sometimes Temporary, sometimes Historical faith. For
(though I know Zach. Vrsin. in explicat.. 2. Quaest. 21. Part. 2. Catech.
Palatinae. etc.
some think otherwise) I take these to be only several appellations of the
same thing, taken from several respects or formalites of the same faith. So
that it is called, (...). 1. In respect of the duration, as (...) is opposed to
Vid. 2 Cor. 4. 18.
(...), and in this sense that faith is called temporal, which is not
perpetual. 2 As (...) is opposed (...) (as H. Grotius well Grotius in Math. 13.
21.
observes) and so that faith is called temporary, which wants a just and
durable fundation to preserve it against the waves and storms of temptation,
and persecutions.

3. I conceave that this faith is not called temporary, in actu exercito, and
de facto, as though it never endured till death; in him that had it, but were
always lost before that time, the temporary beleiver outliveiug his faith, and
looseing his belief before he lost his life. But 2. I believe it is (and should
be) called temporary, in actu signato, and in ordine od posse, because it is
such, in its nature and constitution as may, and (if persecution arise) will be
lost. For when the Text says, When persecution arises they are offended, or
they fall away; this intimates, that if no persecution arise they may
persevere. For why may not that faith continue, and not be taken away, when the
cause is not in being which should take it away? Seeing we know that an
hypocrite (many times) may be so far from fear of persecution for his faith,
that he may have many temporal honors, and advantages by it: In which case, his
encouragements to keep his faith being many, and his fear (occasioned by it,)
little, or none at all, there is no doubt but he, and his temporary faith may
continue together till death.

These things premised, I shall proceed, and that I may do it with more method
and regularity; I shall.

1. Give you my position. 2. The proof of it.
The position is this: Common temporary, or Historical faith (let them be all
one, or some way different as Jac. Vsserius Armachanus in his sum of
Christian Religion page 197. Zach. Vrsinus. part. 2. Catech. in Explicat.. 2.
Quaest. 21. page 107. etc.
good Divines think rationally enough, I shall be content, for the Issue will
be the same as to my purpose, and the proofs I am to bring) differ more then
gradually from saveing faith, which in Scripture is called the faith of the
Tit. 1. 1. fidem quam Deus infundit, and facit credentes. quos in prescientia
sua elegit. Primasius Vticensis in Tit. 1. 1, page 182. Fidem electorum (i. e.)

Now before I come to the proof of this, I must acknowledge that the Mart.

231.
Remonstrants, etc. are (in this particular) my adversaryes: who tell us, that
the faith we call common, or temporary, is not only specifically the same with
saveing faith but even gradually too, so far as to justify those persons that
have it, and would (if they continued in it) save them. This they affirm, as
subservient, and useful for them, in the maintenance of a worse error, the
final Apostasy of the Saints. The arguments they bring to establish their
position, seem (to me) very weak, and inconsequent, such as deserve
co^miseration and pity rather then a solution (as may, and in due time shall be
made appear) and therefore I shall pass them by. The rather, because the
learned and ingenuous person with whom I have to deal, goes not so far (if I
mistake not) nor beleives Common, Temporary, Historical, or miraculous faith
to justify. However that Common faith (be it called Temporary, Historical,
miraculous, or what else you will) is not the same with special, or saveing
faith, nor justyfies them that have it, (which the Jesuits, and some
Remonstrants say) may (I conceave) be manifestly evinced from many
circumstances of the sacred Math. 13. 5, 6, 21, 22.
Text. For that common faith we speak of, is described in the Parable by. 4.
Conditions, or circumstances, which cannot possibly agree to a lively and
justifying faith.

1. The ground (or heart) in which it is, is hard and stony, v. 5. and 20. And
that in opposition to the good ground, (verse 8. 23. and therefore the faith
which is in that ground (that heart) cannot be Justifying faith: It being
impossible that Justifying faith should grow in a stony heart; or so great and
good a virtue in bad ground, seeing saveing faith necessarily presupposes the
Spirit of Christ, from whence only it springs, and is perpetually accompanied
with saveing hope and Terra petrosa significat duritiam cordis, and arescit
semen, qui caret radice charitais. Ven. Beda in Math. 13. page 42.
charity; So that Cor molle si non invenit, presentia sua facit.

2. The text tells us, (verse. 6. 21. that common faith had no root, and
therefore it was not justifying faith. For that never does, nor can want a
root, Christ himself, (and he only) being the Col. 2. 6, 7. Vid. Ephesians. 3. ^7.
root from whence it springs, the true Joh. 15. 4, 5.
Vine, on which alone this branch can grow. It is the fruit of the Gal. 5. 22.
Spirit of Christ in us, and cannot possibly come from any other principle, and
ergo cannot want a root. True beleivers are implanted, and ingrafted into
Christ the true Vine, and from him receave a perpetual supply of sapp, and
moisture, so that they cannot wither for want of a root, or moisture. Christ
is our Col. 2. 19. and Col. 1. 18. 19.
head (certainly of all those who saveingly believe) from which all the
members receave nourishment. Now it is neither an unusual, or insignificant
metaphore, to call the head (in the body natural or mystical) the root of the
body. Aristoteles calls a man, Arbor inversa, making the head the root: for
as sapp, and moisture is conveyed from the root to all parts of the tree, so
is nourishment to all the members from the head. Christ then being, and
dwelling in his members by his Spirit, and being the head, or root from whence
they receave all their graces, and the nourishment, and supplies of them, it is
impossible that true saveing faith should want a root, and ergo that faith in
the parable (call it what you will) which wanted a Gloss. Interli. nearia, non
habent radicem (i. e.) charitatem. Non fundatur semen in humore fidei, and
devotionis. Ita Nicol. Lyranus in Math. 13. Ideo fides vera, and viva non erat,
charitate destituta.
root, was not true justifying faith.

3. The temporary faith in the parable, brought forth no fruit, therefore it
was not a justifying faith, which works by love, and never does, nor can want
fruit. It Is said indeed, that the stony ground (or heart) received the seed
with joy, (i. e.) was pleased with the word, and believed it, but that is all;
nothing of any fruit, that is the property of the good ground only, and ergo'
it is emphatically said of it, that it brought forth fruit. And indeed how could
it bear fruit, having no root to bear it, at least not the true root Jesus
Christ, without whom it is Joh. 15. 5.
impossible to bring forth any fruit. Hence Chrisost. Homil. 46. in Math. page
450. Edit. Savil. (...). Ita Pareus in locum, aliique passim.
Chrysostom (and the Greek Scholia, and Divines generally) truly tells us,
that three parts of the seed perished (1. That by the way. 2. In the stony. 3.
In the thorny ground:) and brought forth Quarta pars tantum fecit fructum.
(Nicol. Lyranus in Math. 13.) part stres infructuosae. Euthemius in Math. 12.
page 177. Tres Semin is parts pereunt, quarta sola fructificat. Aretius in
locum; Ex pugillis. 4. tres redduntur inutiles.
no fruit, but had the faith which received the word been a true, saveing, and
justifying faith (as they say it was for the time it continued, that is, did
then justify them, and would have saved them, had they continued in it) it had
been impossible it should have bee^ fruitless.

4. The temporary faith is such as cannot hold out in time of persecution,
(...). Luke 8. 13. They fall away (as we render it) or they become Apostates
(as the (...) deficio, unde (...) defectio, (...) Apostata. Budaeus. (...), a
Macedonibus deficere. Suidas. (...) desero. Glossae Vet. in calce Cyrilli. So
that (...) is all one as if he had said, signa deserunt, Apostatae fiunt.
word signifyes) and that not after a long combat and conflict, but presently,
(...), by and by, presently they are offended, (...), (as Luke has it) they
Apostatize like a degenerous cowardly Soldier, who is (...), and (...) (as
Nazian calls Julian) a Runagat, who stays not for an onset, but before battle
throws away his buckler, and quitting his station, runs away. This want of
courage in a temporary beleiver to hold out in time of persecution, is argument
enough that his belief is but spurious: true saveing faith, is a faith that
dare 1 Timothy 6. 12.
fight, not only so but it is armor of proof against ALL ((...) Ephesians. 6. 16.
and Vide Hug. Grotium in. 1 John. 5. 18.
(...)) the darts of the Devil, and in the Issue ever is, and will be
victorious, nay victory it self. So the Apostle tells us, 1 John 5. 4.
whatsoever is borne of God overcomes the world, and this is the VICTORY that
overcomes the world, even our FAITH. Not your common, or temporary feith, not
a faith without root, or fruit, but it must be fides formata per charitatem
(as Nicol. Lyranus in. 1 John 5. 4.
Lyranus tells us) such a faith as has good Qui credit, and ^ungit digna opera
fidei. Gloss. Inter lin. in loc.
works joined with it, Gloss. Ordinar. in 1 John 5.
Quae per dilectionem operatur, such a faith as is the Vid Theophyl. in. John.
6. page 646. A. B.
work of God, (...) Oecumen. in 1 John. 5. page 211. Edit. Graecae.
(...), the happy fruit of the Holy Spirit, justifying and sanctifying our
Souls. Intellige non fidem qualemcunque (says a very H. Grotius in loc.
learned Commentator) sed efficacem. Such a faith preserves them, so that they
cannot be overcome. Gratia Christi qua renati sunt fideles conservat eos, ne
peccatum ad mortem committant, and si deliquerint (ne ab host maligno possint
taugi) defendit. So Ven. Beda in 1 John 5. 18. Colon. 1541. page 149.
Bid, and many others both before and after him.

But enough of this, (if not to much) for I see no ground at all to induce us
to believe that temporary faith is a true, and justifying faith; and think
that censure of Paraeus not much amiss (spoken of those who would have
temporary faith to justify) Paraeus in Math. 13. 20. page 724.
Qui pro temporaria contendunt, fidem veram nesciunt.

2. Now though this were enough to show that common and saveing faith are not
specifically the same, but that the difference between them is more then
graduall, yet I shall add some more distinct confirmations of this particularas.

Rat. 1. A more then graduall distinction may be evinced from the nature of the
principles, and causes from whence they spring: which are toto caelo
different. Common belief being generally an acquired Disposition or habit (for
it may be both, and in several times, and persons is so) produced by the
ability of our natural understandings assisted with good education, and
industry. But saveing faith is of a far higher descent, (...) (...). etc.
Oecumen. in 1 John 5. page 211. Veron. 1532. Vid. Jo. de Lugo. de Virtute
fidei. Disp. 1. Sect. 5. number. 65. 66.
(...), Coeli soboles, the immediate work of the Spirit of Christ. From which
vast difference of their causes. Divines generally (both Protestants and
Papists) have conceaved those habits (more then gradually, even) Habitus est
Infusus vel ac quisitus; quae divisio formaliter considerata, sumitur ex
diversis causis efficientibus: Si tamen per se consideretur, indica^
diversitatem essentialem. Francis. Suares Metap. Disp. 44. Sect. 13.. 5.
essentially distinct, calling the one habitus acquisitus, the other
(justifying faith) habitus infusus. 2. The one of these habits (as they stand
in relation to the principles from whence they come) is called habitus ordinis
naturalis, to wit common belief, as being produced by the natural power of
our understandings, assisted with Art, Education, and Industry: The other
(saveing belief) they call, habitus ordinis supernaturalis, (and justly too)
as being the immediate effect of a supernatural cause, the regenerateing
Spirit of Christ. 3. In relation to the same principles, common belief is
called fides humana, as produced by the power of humane causes; saveing faith
they call fides divina, as being the proper, and sole product of the Holy Ghost.

It Is true indeed, both of them may be (and are) called divine, Respectu
objecti ad quod terminantur, but of this we speak not now: But in respect of
the principles from whence they flow, saveing faith is properly divine, common
belief is not, as being generally of an humane descent, and pedigree. Now if
an Infused, and acquired, a supernatural and natural, an humane and divine
habit differ only gradually; I, (and very many more) am much mistaken in my
Metaphysiques. Sure I am Vid Suaretii Metaphys. Disp. 42. Sect. 6.. 15. 16.
Aquin. 1. 2. Quaest. 49. Art. 2. and 3. Gabr. Vasquez in 1, 2. Disp. 78. cap.
3. page 531.. 19.
Suares (one who understood Metaphysiques as well as any) out of Aquinas, tells
us. 1. That it is confessed that habitus and Dispositio differ per facile and
difficile mobile, by their mutability and permanency in relation to the subject
whose habits, and dispositions they are. 2. That this facility and difficulty
of separation from their subjects may distinguish an habit and disposition
essentially. For thus he says -- Qualitates perficientes potentias animae,
quae veniunt suh nomine disposition is and habitus, possunt ESSENTIALITER
distingui per facile and difficile mobile ex natura sua, and causis propriis.
Nam qualitas quae natura sua dependet ex actuali influxu potentiae (as common
belief does) and inde habet quod sit facile mutabilis, ESSENTIALITER differt a
qualitate, quae natura sua no^ habet talem dependentiam (as saveing faith has
not) quia cujusque rei natura non potest melius judicari, quam ex habitudine ad
suas causas etc. If it were granted then (what on no just grounds is pretended)
that Temporary (or common faith, be it what it will) were only a disposition,
and facile mobilis, and saveing faith an habit, and difficulte^ mobilis, yet
they might differ specifically: that difficulty and facility of separation from
their subject ariseing from the causes, and principles from whence they flow,
and not only from the multiplication, or continuation of those Acts which
first introduced them. And thus saveing faith is difficulter mobilis, not only
in adultis, in old beleivers, who are advanced very far in grace toward the
measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, but even in babes, and
newborn Christians, as soon as they have true faith even in the least, and
lowest degree, it is a fixed and permanent quality: 1 John. 3. 9.
He that is borne of God sins not, for the seed remains in him, nor can he,
because he is borne of God. The regenerateing Spirit of God by which faith is
wrought, is such a principle as gives permanency to its own product. Whence it
is, that true faith (even in the lowest degree of it) being difficulter
mobilis, is in propriety of speech an habit, and not a disposition.

Rat. 2. Another ground from whence we may evince a more then graduall
difference between common and special grace, is this: (drawn from the nature
and proper acts of both Qualities) saveing belief is the first Spiritual life
by which a true Christian Every good Christian has a twofold life. 1.
Natural. 2. Spiritual, and as his natural life is either. 1. Substantialis
(as Philosophers say) the Soul, or. 2. Accidentalis, the real effects and
operations of it. So Spiritual life is proportionably. 1. Substantialis, So
the Spirit of Christ, or Christ (who is our life. Col. 3. 4. Workeing by his
Spirit in us,) is our Vita Substantialis, the first principle of all our
spiritual habits, or operations. 2. Accidentalis, so faith, and all Spiritual
motions in us.
lives: The just shall live by faith. Heb. 10. 38. it justifyes, sanctifyes,
and saves us. But common belief is no part of our Spiritual life, seeing it
may be (and many times is) in those who are dead in trespasses, and sins: it
neither justifyes, sanctifyes, or saves him that has it; seeing it is evident,
(and confessed) that it may be in Alia munera mea habent non mei, linguas,
prophetiam, Scientiam, fidem. etc. Ven. Beda in 1 Cor. 13.
impious, and reprobate persons, who live, and dye in impiety. Now if these
Qualities differ only in degree, I desire a reason why common belief should
not be our spiritual life, though in a lesser degree? seeing all qualityes
(natural, moral, and Theological) affect, and denominate their subjects
proportionably to that degree they are in. So Calor in gradu 3. denominates its
subject calidum, as well as Calor in. 6. gradu, though in a less, and inferior
degree. So all Moral, and Intellectual Virtues denominate their subjects
virtuous, proportionable to the degree they are in. For instance, fortitudo
moralis in minori gradu, denominat subjectum suum forte, according to the
measure, and number of those degrees it has, as well as fortitudo in gradu
eminentiori.

Rat. 3. It Is evident that common belief may in many knowing, and studious
persons, thrive into a radicated habit. For there are but. 2. Principal
ingredients which make up common faith, Notitia and assensus. Now an impious,
and irregenerate persons, who has an accute, and perspications understanding,
who is bred to the knowledge of Tongues, Antiquity, and Scripture, who has
good Tutors, and is industrious; such a one (I say) may come to a very great
measure of knowledge of Divine verities both Speculative and Practical, and
having many Mediums, and arguments to demonstrate the truth of those
Conclusions, may have a firm, and radicated assent (such as it is)
proportionable to the many mediums which produce it. 2. I suppose that special,
or saveing faith has it is many degrees (as well as common belief) for there
is a Revel. 3. 8. (...). 1 John 2. 1. (...), little Childern. So Math. 6. 30,
and 8. 26, and 14. 31.
little, and a great, a strong and a Act. 20. 35. Romans 4. 19. Romans 14. 1, 2,

weak saveing faith (yet all saveing) there are babes in Christ (and yet in
Christ) and strong men, such as are come to a more perfect consistence, toward

respect of their spiritual growth, and consistency in it. Now take the very
lowest degree of saveing faith, and it is really our spiritual life, it makes
us acceptable to God, justifyes, sanctifyes, and saves us: whereas the highest
degree, and most radicated habit of common faith does no such thing. So that it
seems evident to me, (and generally to all Divines beside) that saveing faith
is not only a higher degree of common faith, but an other faith specifically
distinct from the former; differing Respectu essentiae and naturae suae,
although Respectu Inhaerentiae, they Vid. Johan de Lugo de Virtute Fidei
Divinae. Disp. 2. Sect. 2. Number. 91. 92. page 114.
may be, and many times are (simul and semel) in the same subject.
Cantuariensis, Alhazen, Vitellio. etc. Tell us, that the light of the Sun,
and the lesser light of the Moon in the Air, are not several degrees of the
same specifical light, but several lights (though at the same time, in the same
subject) essentially differeing, having both distinct principles from whence
they flow, and distinct formal effects, and operations: Lumina (say they) sunt
in medio impermixta, and distincta, and they demonstrate it, from their
distinct shadows. etc. As all know, who know any thing in optiques. Now as
these 2. Lights in the Air are essentially distinct, and not different degrees
of the same light, so the lesser light of common, and the greater of saveing
faith, are not different degrees only of the same faith, but two different
beleifes, distinct in their nature and essence, as proceeding from far
different Principles, and having different formal effects, and operations.
Suppose then a Soul enlightened with common faith (which is to the soul, as
that of the moon to the eye, but a dim light) and then le^t such a one be
regenerated, so that the sun Malach. 4. 2. Luke 1. 78. (...) Oriens ex alto,
lux coelestis, matutina. Isa. 9. 2.
of Righteousness (which is the true light, which enlightens every Saint, and
true servant of his) shed a broad his glorious beams in his heart, That
common, and saveing Grace may coexist in the same subject, I doubt not no more
then that opinio and scientia may: which is generally confessed by
Philosophers; and Schoolmen. Vid. Ant. Ruvio de Habitibus. Tract. 5. Quaest.
3. Number. 81. page 192. Halensem Part. 3. Quaest. 79. memb. 3. Atisiodorensem,
Bonaventuram, Henricum etc. a Ruvio citatos ibidem.
these remain distinct lights, and not only degrees of the same light. For,
as the light of the Moon (as it is in the waine, waxeing, or full Moon) may
produce a less, or a greater light, yet cannot possibly produce the light of
the Sun, nor are those degrees of light caused by the Moon, any dispositions
at all, to produce the light of the Sun, (for it is evident the light of the
Moon no more disposes the Air to receave the Sunne-beames, then darkness
does) so a good natural understanding helped on with learning, good educatio^,
and industry may acquire common faith in a high degree, but has no possibility
to produce saveing belief (that must come from higher principles) nor is
common faith any Disposition (moral, or Evangelicall) whereby the subject that
has it, is, or can be disposed (in the way we now speak of) for the
Introduction of the Habit of saveing faith, for

1. Till Fides in Christum est INITIVM, and fundamentum salutis, and per eam
TOTA reliqua salus impetratur. Estius in Ephesians. 2. 8.
we have this faith (saveing and justifying faith) we are Qui mortui sunt, a
seipsis non excitantur ad Vitam, nec ad eam accipiendam aliquid conferunt de
suo. Zanchius in Ephesians. 2. 8. and idem ibidem page 59. Col. 2. Non ex vobis]

dead in trespasses and sins. Now as a man naturally dead, cannot possibly
dispose himself to a natural life, so a man Spiritually dead, (and such all
are before saveing Faith) cannot dispose himself to a spiritual life.

2. Our new birth is (in scripture phrase) a new creation, which is ex materia
indisposita, and therefore has no such preceding Dispositions.

3. Our Regeneration, and the workeing faith in our souls, is solely, and
wholly a gracious Act of the good Spirit of God regenerateing us, and so a
supernatural Act, and how any Sine Gratia nemo currit ad Gratiam, Prosper.

natural, or artificial product of our understandings (though helped, and
advanced with learneing, education, and Industry) can be a Disposition to
supernatural Grace, and such a disposition (as we now speak of) which differs
from that supernatural Grace only in degree, I am yes to learn.

4. The Apostle tells us, Ephesians. 2. 8. Gratia servati estis gratis data; per
fidem quam Spiritus Sanctus dono suo Infundit. Primasius Uticensis in loc. page
136.
That we are saved by faith, and that not of our selves, it is the gift of God;
saveing faith is so entirely the gift of God, that we have no hand in procuring
it; and therefore all Divines generally call it an Infused Vid. Aquin 1. 2.
Quaest. 51. Art. 4. Rob. Baronium Exercitat. 3. Art. 8. page 177. Reliquosque
citatos, a Joh. Martiner in. 2. Sent. Did. 27. Quaest. 1. page 298.
habit of a supernatural order to which we neither do (nor can) actively
concur. But if common faith may be acquired by our own understandings
(helped with education, learneing, and Industry) and this be essentially the
same with saveing faith, then I see not, how saveing faith can be the gift of
God so, that it is not of our selfs. Because (if this hypothesis be true) it
is, and may be more of our selves, and of our Acquisition, then of the Holy
Spirit by infusion: seeing the essence of saveing faith may be acquired by us,
which is more then the degree of tha Quality, which is only left to be the
product of Gods Spirit.

5. I do not find that saveing faith is promised us upon any precedent
condition to be performed by us, and therefore I know no preparatory
Dispositions to it, which can dispose, and fit the subject (as Dispositions
do to the reception of such Habits as gradually only differ from them) for
the Introduction of it.

6. It is (to me) evident, that whatsoever goes before saveing faith, Heb. 11.
6. Romans 8. 8. Fides est fundamentum omnium bonorum, ideo sine fide non possu
mus Deo placere. Primasius Vticensis. in Heb. 11. 6. page 236. Idem habet
Estins in Ephesians. 2. 8.
neither is, nor can be pleaseing to God, nay not only so but highly
displeases him, Romans 8. 5, 6, 7. etc.
The carnal mind (and such is every mind of man till it be made spiritual,
by regeneration, and collation of saveing faith) is enmity against God. Now how
that which displeases God, and is enmity against him, can morally, or
evangelically (for there can be no natural disposition to a pure supernatural
effect) dispose us to our regeneration, and the Infusion of saveing faith (at
present,) I understand not.

7. If a temporary faith, or Historical, (such as Hypocrites, and Devils
themselves may have) and such common graces of knowledge (either in natural,
civil, or sacred things) were (as is pretended) dispositions to saveing faith;
then it were rational to think, that such persons so qualified, and disposed,
should generally, and with more facility be converted and prove real

take his journey? I say, it is rational to believe, that persons so qualifyed,
and disposed to saveing faith, should sooner be brought to it, then those that
want such dispositions, or have them in a lower, and less degree. Yet (if the
Ghospel be true) it is evidently otherwise, and generally those have been
converted to Christianity, who had not such measures of knowledge, and common
graces, when those have not, which had. In our Saviors time, few of the
Pharesies, and learned Rabbis embraced the Gospel (who yet knew much more of
the word of God, of the Divinity, and sense of the whole law, and of the
promises which concerned the Messiah, then the common people did. I say few of
these embraced the Ghospel, when yet many of the poor ignorant people did.

Have any of the Rulers, or Phrasees believed on him? was a confiderable
Quaestion to this purpose, intimateing that few, or none had. So elsewhere;
Luke 7. 30.
The Pharisees, and Lawyers rejected the Council of God, ((...)) against, or
within themselves: when yet the common people (otherwise ignorant of the law,
at least, in comparison of the Pharisees, who certainly knew more) did really
believe in our Savior, and submitted to the Gospel. For that is the meaneing
of what follows; Luke 7. 49.
but this people which knows not the law, is cursed. And S. Paul more fully
to the same purpose, 1 Cor. 1. 26, and 27.
You see your calling brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not
many mighty, not many noble are called (vocatione interna, externa enim omnes
aeque vocabantur) but God has chosen (...), Eos qui a mundo ob eruditionis

(...)) the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. etc. Those that
wanted the common graces of learneing, and knowledge in morality, and Divinity,
came in sooner to Christ, then their great Doctors, their Rabbyes, and learned
Philosophers.

Not that great knowledge and understanding (in sacred, or civil things) which
may be in hyhocrites, is ex natura sua, any way opposite, (much less
contradictory) to the Gospel, bur ex accidente and vitio personae cui insunt,
such persons wanteing faith, and so spiritual prudence to make a right use of
them. A good sword may be of good use for defense, but not in a mad man's hand.
Before saveing faith we are carnally minded, fools, and mad (as to spiritual,
and saveing knowledge) and that knowledge which the most knowing natural men
have, is not only no disposition fitting us to receave saveing faith, but many
times an Indisposition, and obstacle which hinders our conversion. Whence it
is, that S. Paul tells us, that 1 Cor. 8. 7. Lyranus in locum. Scientia sine
charitate facit superbire. Glossa Ordinaria, and Interlinearia. Per se inutilis
est scientia, cum charitate Vtilis. Primasius Uticens^s. Scientia Inflat]

Carthag. 3, Canon. 4.
knowledge pusseth up (non ex natura sua, sed vitio personae, for that I would
have remembered) especially in the irregenerate, who want true grace, and
saveing faith to sanctify it: seeing even in the regenerate themselves (in whom
Relliquiae Danaum, and priscae vestigia culpae, the remains of Original
corruption, remain still) such knowledge many times, is a dangerous temptation
to pride, and self conceitednesse. So we see evidently in S. Paul, to whom by
the good providence of God, an Angel of Satan ((...)) was given (for though it
was an affliction, yet it was, and he took it for a gift, and blessing) to
buffet him, that he might not be exalted above measure, by reason of his much
knowledge, and many revelations. In short, I believe it is an evident truth,
(if we will with humility submit to the Ghospel of Jesus Christ, and the divine
manifestations of truth therein contained) that there are no qualities
whatsoever preceding faith, and regeneration, which in any propriety can be
called dispositions, disposeing and fitting us to saveing faith, and
concurreing with the subject to the Introduction of it, as natural, or moral
Dispositions do to introduce an Habit, it being manifestly repugnant to the
nature of an Infused Habit, to have any such precedaneous Dispositions. This is
that which the Fathers of the Aransican Council do in terminis affirm against
the Pelagians. Conciliuro Arausicanum. 2 Can. 6. apud Francis. Joverium.

Rat 4. Princip. Common grace (as the understanding of many tongues, a great
measure of knowledge of many Divine truths, and an Assent to them. etc.) is I
say generally; for the knowledge of many tongues, and Intelligence of many
divine truths, and the Scriptures, have been, and possibly may still be
immediately Infused by God. Yet now (miracles ceaseing) they are generally
acquired by Art, and Industry. Deus quandoque infundit homini illos etiam
Habitus, qui naturali virtute possunt causari: sicut Apostolis dedit scientiam
Scripturarum, and Linguarum, quam homines per studium, vel consuentudinem
acquirere possunt, licet non adeo perfect. Aquin. 1. 2. Quaest. 51. Art. 4. In
Corp. Articul.
generally a disposition, or Habit produced by our natural understandings,
advanced by education and Industry, and so depending only upon a mutable
principle (the will and understanding) may be lost again by the negligence, or
malice of the same facultyes, as is evident, and on all sides confessed. But
saveing faith is such, as being immediately produced by the eternal, and
immutable, regenerateing Spirit of Christ, it is 1 Pet. 1. 23.
incorruptible, and John. 17. 3.
eternal: This is eternal life to know thee, etc. He speaks of the knowledge
of God by faith, which is not only our Heb. 10. 38.
life, but John. 6. 47, 51, 54.
eternal life, which cannot possibly perish.

Eternal life is not corruptible, cannot perish, or cease to be, but the life
of faith which we have by our new birth, and regeneration, is eternal life,
and therefore cannot perish. Our natural life received from corruptible
parents by corruptible seed, and a natural generation may be lost; but our
Spiritual life, received from incorruptible parents, by incorruptible seed, in
our regeneration, cannot be lost, being (like the a John. 113. and 1 John. 3.
9, and 5, 1, 4, 18.
Parent, and seed from whence it comes) incorruptible, and eternal. The
Apostle in Confer. 1. John. 3. 9. cum. 1 John 5. 18.
express terms tells us so. Whosoever is borne of God does not commit sin,
for his seed remains in him, nor can he commit sin, because he is borne of
God. There is nothing but sin can rob us of this life of faith which we have by
the Spirit in our reggneration: and that we cannot sin so, as to deprive us of
this life, he proves by. 2 Arguments: the 1. drawn from the Parent which begat
us; the 2. from the seed by which we are begotten. Thus.

1. Whosoever is borne of God commits not sin, be cause the seed remains in
him. None in who^ the seed remains, commit sin: In all that are borne of God
the seed remains. ergo. None who are borne of God commit sin. This from the
seed.

2. He that is borne of God cannot sin (so as to render his life corruptible)
because he is borne of God. Thus: none who are borne of God commit sin; every
regenerate person is borne of God. ergo. No regenerate person commits sin.

So that the immortality of our faith, and spiritual life is not from us, but.
1. From its parent, the liveing, and immortal God. 2. From the nature of the
seed from whence our faith, and spiritual life spring, which the text calls
incorruptible. The truth is. S. John's meaneing is not, that the regenerate sin
not at all (for he himself expressly confutes that gloss, telling us that we
1 John. 1. 8.
deceave our selves, and 1 John. 1. 10
make God a liar, if we say we sin not) But that they sin not so as to be
overcome, and conquered, and killed by sin, to the loss of their spiritual
life: for he expressly tells us, that all those who are borne of God are
Soldiers, at war with the world, but also that they are always Conquerors*,
and their faith Victorious. 1 John. 5. 4.
Whatsoever is borne of God overcomes the world, and this is the victory that
overcomes the world, even our faith. They sin not so as to sink under it,
they keep 1 John. 5. 18. Gratia conservat eos, ne peccatum ad mortem
committant, and si in quibustibet spro humana fragilitate) deliquerint, ne
ab'hoste maligno possint sangi, defendit. Venerab. Beda in locum. page 149.
themselves from the wicked one, so that he touches them not, or as S. Peter
expresses it, 1 Pet. 1. 5.
They are kept by the power of God, through faith, unto salvation, Ven. Beda
in. 1. Pet. 1. 5.
Neque enim quisquam suae libertatis potentia custodiri valet in bonis, sed
illius per omnia quaerendum est auxilium ut perficiamur, a quo initium bonae
action is accepimus. All this considered, I suppose temporary, and eternal,
corruptible and incorruptible, are differences which infer a greater
distinction then in degree only: and ergo Temporary and common belief differs
from saveing faith more then in degree.

Rat. 5. Princip. Itis a known, and received principle in School Divinity,
and Philosophy too, that Habits are distinguished specifically by their formal
objects. The meaneing is not, that those objects are intrinsecal, and essential
differences constituteing, and distinguishing such Habits: But a posteriori,
and in ordine ad nos. we who know not the essential forms, and differences of
such Qualities, do a posteriori (rationally too, and certainly) collect what
kind of distinction is between them, from the different habitudes, and
relations those Habits have to their formal objects. Now although common and
saveing faith may (at least in For saveing faith beleives diverse things, which
Hypocrites by their common faith neither do nor can (upon any just ground)
believe. Vid. Rob. Baronium. Exercit. 3. Art. 30.. 5. page 280.
part) have the tame objectum material^, to wit sacred truths revealed by God
in the Ghospel. Yet the formalis tendentia, and habitudo utriusque Habitus ad
hoc objectum, is different, and ergo. The Habits more then gradually distinct.
Now the different tendentia and habitudo which common and saveing faith have to
their objects, is taken from the several mediums, and motives induceing such
assent. For instance, That Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he dyed, rose
again, ascended into heaven. etc. These Conclusions are believed to be Divine
truths both by common and saveing faith, but upon far different, mediums, and
motives. The common faith is built upon humane mediums, and arguments, such as
the natural understandings of irregenerate persons (helped with learneing,
education, and Industry) may attain unto, which have no absolute certainty,
and Infallibility in them, and so must (of necessity) beget an assent
proportionable to themselves, that is, uncertain and fallible. But saveing
faith is built upon better principles, as proceeding from the Spirit of Christ,
and being built upon his immediate illumination and testimony, which is
evidently divine, and infallible: and so begets an assent of faith (like the
cause, and principle from whence it comes) divine, and infallible. Now this
latter assent must of necessity differ from the former more then in degrees.
Now I believe that no sober, and intelligent person, who understands
Philosophy, and Metaphysiques, will say that an assent which is humane,
dubious, and Incertaine, differs only gradually from an assent which is
divine, and most infallibly certain, as proceeding from, (and relying
immediately upon the Testimony of) the regenerateing Spirit of Christ.

For the further explication of this, take this Instance. This conclusion
[Omnis homo habet potentiam Intellectivam] is the same material object of
Science (properly so called) and Opinion, but formally different. So that
those. 2. Habits, though they have the same objectum materiale, yet they have
objectum formaliter diversum. Which formal difference is taken from the
tendentia, and Habitudo those two Assents have to that object, in relation to
several Vide Martini Smiglecii Logicam. Dispurat. 11. Quaest. 2. page 414.
mediums produceing such assents. For he that assents to this conclusion [Omnis
homo habet potentiam Intellectivam] per medium necessarium, and demonstrativum,
his assent (like the medium which produces it) is necessary and scientifical.
But he that assents per medium probabile only, his assent (proportionable to
the medium which inferres it) is only probable, and opinative. So that
although that Conclusion be the object of science and opinion too, and be
materially the same, yet it is formally a different object, from whence arises
not only a gradual, but a formal and specificall difference between science
and opinion. For many probable mediums may dispose to an higher probability,
and produce an habitual, and more firm opinion; but all the probable mediums
in the world can never produce science, a necessary and infallible assent, that
being an assent of a higher (not degree only but) nature, which no argument
less then demonstrative, can possibly produce.

So that as opinion and science, though about the same conclusion, are Habits
specifically distinct, and known and confessed to be so, by reason of the
different mediums which produce such assents: so likewise are common and
saveing faith more then gradually different, by reason of the several mediums,
and motives, which are the Premises and foundations upon which those assents
are built, and constitute their objects in a several formality and habitude in
relation to those Assents. To bring all this home to our present purpose: I
grant, that common, and saveingly beleiveing Christians may believe these, (and
such like) conclusions [Christ dyed for us, satisfied Gods justice, interceeds
for us with his Father. etc.] to be divine truths. 2 But they can have no
greater assurance of the divine truth of these conclusions, then they have of
the mediums, and premises which infer them. 3. Hypocrites, and impious
persons who may have common faith, have no premises to infer them, but such
as are humane, and dubious, at least not absolutely infallible, that is they
have only Topicall, and probable arguments, such as the authority of their
teachers, of counsels, Fathers, and Tradition etc. If it be said they have
Scripture for them; I reply, that the same Question returns: what mediums, and
motives have they to believe that to be Gods word? for their assent to the
divine truth of Gods word, can be no firmer, and certain, then the premises
which infer that assent. Now Hypocrites neither have, (nor can have) any
premises, or motives to believe the Divinity of that word, but such as I named
before, that is Topical, and probable inducements, and ergo their assent
(proportionable to those motives) must (of necessity) be only probable and
opinative.

But on the other side, regenerate persons, who are borne of God, and have true
saveing faith, have surer, and more infallible principles which induce them to
believe and know the divine truth of those conclusions. For besides all those
inducements which Hypocrites have, they have the inward testimony of the Spirit
of God beareing witness to those truths. That this may appear, I say.

1. That it is evident that all regenerate persons have the Romans 8. 9.
Spirit of Christ dwelling in them.

2. It is as evident that this good Spirit of Christ gives testimony to these
saveing truths, and conclusions. Inlightening the understandings of his
childeren that they may know the truth, and (omnipotentissima facilitate)
induceing their assents, for

1. Our Soviour says, John. 7. 17.
If any man, will do his will, he shall know of the truth of the doctrine,
whether it be of God? etc. He shall know, when others shall not. And ergo.
holy, regenerate persons have some Deus illustrat eos qui vitiis, suis non
patrocinantur. H. Grotius in Joh. 7. 17. Glossa Ordin. Si ^is intelligere,
creed. Si quis credit in filium Dei, cognoscet de Doctrina. etc.
better means of knowing truth then Hypocrites have.

2. Hence the regenerate are said to be ledd by the Romans 8. 14. John. 16. 13.
Spirit of God, and he leads them into all truth at least all necessary truth
(if it be And if in this place it be granted to be meant only of the Apostles,
yet you have the same expression, by he same John extended to other beleivers,
1 John 2. 20.
meant of any but the Apostles) And no question the Spirit of truth does (in
some proportion) teach the truth and illuminate the understandings of all those
who are borne of God. He is (as Tertullian calls him) Vicarius Christi
Spiritus, his deputy as to his prophetical Office, and as Christ taught he
truth in person while here, so he still teaches it by his Spirit being gone.

3. If you continue in my word (says our John. 8. 32.
Savior) then are you my disciples indeed, and ye shall know the truth. They
shall, when Hypocrites shall not, who continue not in his word, and therefore
are not his disciples indeed. Ye shall know the truth, by the illumination of
the Spirit, and his confirmation of you in it. Whence it is said that we are 2

anointed, and sealed by the Spirit, and established, and he is (...), and

Qui signavit nos dando Spiritum Sanctum nobis pignus, ut non ambigamus de
promissis ejus. Hypocrites, and those who have common faith only have no such
principle to assure them of the promises, and therefore no such infallibility
in their faith. And a most learned Commentator on the same Text, to the same
purpose, on these words -- (...). He that establishes you with us, and
annoints you, is God. Adds thus -- Hug. Grotius in, 2 Cor. 1. 21. page 459. Qui
confirmat nos in Christo.] i. e. In side Christi. Et unxit nos, spirituali
unctione Spiritus Sancti. Dionys. Carthusianus in loc. page 260.
A Deo procedit ista Vnctio, id est Spiritus operatio interior, FIDEM in
Christo FVLCIENS ET ROBORANS. So that in the regenerate (not so in hypocrites,
and those who have only common faith) the internal operation of the Spirit
does support, and roborate, and confirm their faith in Christ,

4. And to this purpose is that of S. John: 1 John. 2. 20. Hinc fit, ut docente
vos interius Spiritu Sancto, minus indigeatis hominum Institutione. Beda in
loc. page 119.
But ye have an unction from the holy Ghost, and know all things, and need not
that any man teach you, save as that annointeing teaches you. Whence it is
evident that the holy Ghost teaches the regenerate all things, that is all
necessary things, at least in reference to their seducers. Grotius in 1 John.
2. 20.
Quod ait, (...), intellige quae ad vitandos impostores erant necessaria. And
although the Papists miserably pervert this Text, yet they grant, that by
unction here, the Holy Ghost is meant Estius in. 1^ John. 2. 20. page 1267.
col. 6. etc.
Quo velut oleo mentes fidelinm persundit Christus, multiplicem eis gratiam
largiendo, tum Doctrine, tum Scientiae.

5. Lastly by the Testimony of the Holy Spirit within, they who are borne of
God may, and do know, that God is reconciled to them, and is now their Romans 8.
15. 16.
Father, that he 1 John. 3. 24.
dwells in them, and therefore that their sins are pardoned. etc. This
blessed Spirit is a 1 eohn. 5. 6.
witness in the heart of all true beleivers, and 1 John. 5. 10. Romans 8. 16.
Ephesians. 1. 17.
testifyes of the truth of their faith, and (as S. Paul tells us) bears
witness with our Spirits, that we are the Childeren of God.

But enough of this; (if not too much) for I am persuaded, there is hardly any
thing in Scripture more manifest then this; That all regenerate persons have
the Spirit of Christ in them, which testifyes, and bears witness to the truth
of the Ghospel believed by them, illuminates their understandings that they may
know it, and is a seal, and confirmation of their assent to it. So that
saveing faith in regenerate persons relying upon the inward testimony of the
Spirit of Christ (which common beleivers have not) a Divine and Infallible
Testimony their faith must of necessity differ from the faith of Hypocrites
more then only in degree. (...) quod erat demonstrandum. And here give me
leave to ad these considerations.

1. That they of Rome laugh, and jeare at our Divines, when they speak of this
Inward testimony, and call it Vid. Tho. Stapletonum, de Authorit. Interpretandi
Scriptur. Controvers. 6. lib. 10. cap. 4. page 359. etc. 360.
private Spirit, and so think to fright us out of our true faith, with false
calumnies, and a good opinion, with bad names. Ans. Non sic abibunt odia. We
will not, cannot be jeared out of our profession, and a manifest Gospel
truth. All we say, is this. 1. That the regenerateing Spirit of Christ is in
all his real members, in every true Christian, who is indeed borne of God. 2.
That the good Spirit is. 1. A Spirit of illumination, inabling them to know. 2.
Of corroboration, and confirmation, inabling them to assent to the truth so
discovered, and known; and. 3. A Spirit which works adhesion, constancy, and
perseverance in that truth, by beareing witness with our Spirits, and giveing
testimony to that truth and victoriously assisting the regenerate in
continueing in it, against all temptations, and persecutions whatsoever.
Whereas the want of this, is the reason why those (...), the common, and
temporary beleivers fall away, and loose that which they seem to have. Now
this Spirit (which only we assert) is noe private Spirit (as they ignorantly
or maliciously would make the world believe) but the public spirit of the true
Catholic Church (the Mystical body of Christ) which actuates, and animates
every member of of that great body, and communicates spiritual life to it.

the business) after great Tragedies, and long harangues to obscure the truth
in the Issue neither dare, nor do say less.

2. Why, but all heresies, and sects pretend to the spirit, Anabaptists,
Seekers, Quakers, etc. And possibly (at least some of them) really believe they
have it, and yet run into wild, and monstrous errors (both of says, and fact)
fitter to be concealed, and buried in eternal silence, then repeated. And
therefore little heed to be given to this pretense of the spirit. Answer. 1.
That this our age, and Country has been unhappily fruitful (quae est fundi
nostri calamitas) in produceing wild herefies; and (I fear) it is the crime of
our Nation, as well as the calamity. 2. That these (as nothing else in the
world) come by change, a Pagan could tell us, Sophocles in Ajace (...). v. 385.

(...). It Is the good providence of God, which for reasons infinitely wise in
themselves, (though many times unknown to us) permits their ingresse into the
world, puts limits and bounds to, and orders their progress, to the glory of
his name, the good of his own, and the punishment of others; and for their
egresse, will (in his good time) put a period to them. That he will speedily

refellendae, their refutation may possibly be as soon effected by our prayers,
and piety as by our pens. 3. But what if Heretics falsely pretend to the
Spirit of truth, shall their lie make the direction, and illumination of that
good spirit ineffectuall to those who are so happy as indeed to have it? Was
the title of the Athenian merchants any worse to their ships which came into
the Piraea, (or Port of Athens) because the madd man in the story thonght, (and
confidently said) they were all his? May not those who have good, and well
disposed eyes see, and certainly know the objects they look upon are
immovable and fixed, because they who have (...), quibus omnia rotari, and
circumferri videntur) think otherwise? The mad man in the Tragedy said (and I
doubt not believed it too) that he saw two suns, and another Thebes, (...),
and yet those who were not guilty of so much Frenzy, did, and might trust
their own eyes, that both Thebes, and the the sun were single. The Church of
Rome was sure enough of the truth of her belief (by the Gospel, and the good
Spirit of God confirmeing and witnesseing the truth of it to their souls) even
then when Donatus said, that the Church, and Spirit of Christ was only in him,

as many, and as wild Heresies, as we now The truth is, the errors, and
heresies of those who confidently pretend to the Spirit of Christ, but have it
not, are no prejudice to, or argument against those who are so happy as to have
it, but that they may, and ought to rely upon the witness, and Divine
testimony it gives to the truth: So that their faith (and theirs only) is
divine, not only respectu objecti, the sacred word of God, containeing the
truths believed, but respectu principii too, the regenerateing Spirit of
Christ, from whom their understandings have divine illumination to know, and
strength, and confirmation to believe, and obey the truth. 4. I have only this
to add, that this witness and testimony of the spirit is only argumentum ad
intra, a convinceing argument to him that has it, whereon he may rely, and be
assured himself, not argumentum ad extra, whereby he may convince others. This
is that inward witness, which did so confirm the primitive persecuted
Christians in their faith, so persuade and convince their understandings of the
present truth of the Ghospel, and that all the gracious promises contained in
it, would be fulfilled, and made good for the future, that they who could not
dispute, could, and did die for their faith; and that with so much courage, and
miraculous constancy, as amazed their persecutors, and made even the Pagan
world believe, that such strange courage and confidence, in the loss of (what
this world calls dearest) livelihood, and life too, could not proceed from any
principle less then divine. Whence it was that Sanguis Martyrum, was semen
Ecclesiae, the death of many old, gave life to more new Christians. Sed manum
de tabula, enough of this.

Rat. 6. If saveing and common grace be essentially the same, then
irregenerate, and impious persons (who may, and many times have common graces)
might be called (and indeed were) as truly gracions, and as truly beleivers
as the best Saints, and Sonns of God, although not in so high a degree. For (by
this hypothesis against which we now dispute) they have as true faith and
grace, as regenerate persons themselves: seeing common in the wicked, and
special grace in the regenerate are (by this hypothesis) essentially the same.
For as the smallest wire of good gold, is as truly gold as the whole wedge,
though not so much; and as a body hot in the second, or third degree, is as
truly hot, as that which has heat in the 6. or 8. degree. So, if common grace
in hypocrites, and saveing grace in the Saints, be essentially the same, then
such impious persons (for common grace may be in such) may be justly called as
true beleivers, and as truly gracious, as the most regenerate persons in the
world. But this is certainly untrue and repugnant to the received, and clear
principles of Divinity, and Philosophy too. The Moral Philosopher truly tells
us, that (...). Arist. de moribus lib. 2. cap. 5. Commentatores universi ib.
virtus est habitus recta ratione electivus, prout vir prudens definiverit, So
that he that has not moral prudens (that great Virtus directiva) has indeed no
moral virtue, for all virtues (as Philosophers Vides is Aristotelem Ethic.

Aristotle says truly, that no vicious person is, or can be prudent; vice,
and the irregular passions in such, corrupting that great virtue. And ergo
wicked men (whatever common graces, or virtues they may seem to have) neither
are, nor can be truly virtuous, no not in respect of Moral virtues. 2. And.
ergo much less in respect of those virtues we call Theological, as wanteing
faith (which is the first, and foundation of all Theological Virtues) and
Christian prudence, all wicked men being (in scripture phrase, and) really
fools. But I shall not insist upon this which (I believe) no sober person will

tells us. 1. That the wills acceptance of Christ is the essential form of

essential to this acceptance. Whence I infer thus: If the essence of
saveing faith consist in accepting Christ, and loveing him as our Lord and
Savior then those who do not so love, and accept him, have not the essence of
saveing faith, but no irregenerate person (let him have what common faith he
will) does so accept, and love Christ (as it evident) and ergo. No irregenerate
person has the essence of true saveing faith. Now this being granted, it
further follows, That common and saveing belief are not essentially the same;
seeing common belief may be (and many times is) in Hypocrites, who do not,
cannot (while such) so accept and love Christ. For I reason thus: That belief
and love which is said to be essential to saveing faith must either be.

1. A love and belief (...) only, (...), a belief and love inapperance only
without truth and reality. I confess common beleivers may have such a faith
and love as this, but this is not it which is esse^tiall to saveing belief, as
I take for granted, the assertion of the contrary being not only ridiculous,
but impious.

2. Or such a love and belief as are (...) really and truly such, (which of
necessity must be meant) and then I deny that Hypocrites, or any irregenerat
person whatsoever (let him have what common faith he will) has any such
belief in, or love to Christ.

Rob. Baronius exercitat. 3. de fide and scientia. Arr. 30. page 280. 281. etc.
Rob Baronius, and others generally, have many things to the same purpose. I
confess Hypocrites may have so much common faith, as really to believe the
whole History of the Scripture to be true, (as they believe Livy, or
Thucydides) and even Devils do as much: but that Christ has actually
satisfied for their sins, so as the debt is paid, and they freed, that he has
reconciled his father to them, that their sins are pardoned, or they justified,
that they are sonns of God here, or; shall be heirs of Heaven hereafter, all
these (and such like, which regenerate men by saveing faith believe) they
neither do, nor (upon any just ground) can believe, but rather that the Romans
1. 18.
wrath of God lies upon them, and will, so long as they continue in that
condition. Hyprocrites, and such irregenerate persons (qui res mundi curant,
non Christi) may have a sceptique, speculative, and floateing faith, such as
may beget disputes, and opinions in their head, by not Christ in their heart
(fides Vide Epistolam Eubuli Cordati Monreseosuo dat: Romae, 1529. Inter Opera
Nicolai de Clemang. part. 2. p. 2.
syllogismos in capite, non Christum in cord progeneratura.) 2. The acceptance
of Christ as our Lord and Savior, (which is here affirmed to be essential to
saveing faith) is not in hypocrites, and common beleivers, and therefore common
and saveing faith are not essentially the same: For if they were, then every
common beleiver (though otherwise an impious, irregenerate Hypocrite) should
(as such) accept of Jesus Christ for his Lord and Savior: But this is
manifestly untrue. For. 1. The Romans 6. 16.
Apostle tells us, that he is our Lord, and we his servants whom we obey; it
being manifest that we accept him for our Lord to whose commands we obediently
submit. Now if irregenerate persons submitted themselves to the Gospel, or
obeyed the Lord Jesus, then indeed they might be said to accept him for their
Lord, but seeing it is (...) point blanke contrary, seeing they Ibid. Romans 6.
12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18.
obey sin and Satan as their sovereigns which reign over them, seeing either

God, and of necessity must be so while they are irregenerate, such Romans 16. 18.
serve not the Lord Jesus, (says the Apostle) and. ergo accept him not as
their Lord. and if so (let them have what common faith they will) then they not
the essence of saveing faith, and then it evidently follows that common and
saveing faith are not essentially the same. Quod erat demonstrandum. 2. Christ

condition of faith and repentance. and erge. He that does not perform the
condition receaves him not. As if Sempronius tell Titius he will receave him
into his service, and be a good Lord and Master to him, if he will first pay.
5l. or do some such thing, If (in this case) Titius pay the 5l. and fulfill
the condition (be what it will) it is evident he accepts the offer, and takes
Sempronius for his Master,, and not otherwise. Now I subsume, that
irregenerate persons (notwithstanding any common faith they have or can have)
do not perform the Mark. 1. 15. and 6. 12. etc.
condition upon which Christ is tendered to them as their Lord, and Master,
and ergo. accept him not: And by consequence (though they have common faith,
yet) they have not the essence of justifying faith, and then common, and
saveing faith will not be (as is pretended) essentially the same.

2. When it is said, M. Baxters Aphorisimes of Justifcation. In Explicat. These.
69. page 266.
That love to Christ as our Lord and Savior is essential to justifying faith,
I subsume, But common beleivers, (such as have only common faith, being indeed
hypocrites, and irregenerate) have no such love to Christ, and ergo (though
they have common faith, yet) they have not the essence of true saveing faith;
whence it necessarily follows, that common and saveing faith are not
essentially the same, for if they were, he that had one, had the essence of
both. That common beleivers have no such real love to Christ; as their Lord
and savior, appears.

1. Because in Scripture, only regenerate, and penitent persons are Exodus 20,
5, 6.
said to love God, all others are haters of him. For by haters there the
disobedient, and impenitent are meant, and by those tht love him the contrary,
regenerate and penitent persons.

2. Irregenerate persons (let them have what common faith you will) obey not
God, nor the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and therefore they love him not. If any
man love me he will keep my word (says our John. 14. 23. all that love Christ
keep his commandments, and, ergo those that keep not his commandments (as
Hypocrites and irregenerate persons do not) do not love him. Vide H. Grotium
in versum. 24. Qui precepta mea non observant, ut mundani homines, ij me non
diligunt. etc.
Savior) and my Father will love him etc. But enough of this, for I am ashamed
to prove a truth so evident in Scripture, so Catholikely received, and believed
by the Christian world, that I hardly ever heard of any (save a Pelagian, or
Socinian) who believed that Hypocrites, and irregenerate persons either did, or
could really love Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, especially with such
a love as is essential to justifying faith, and that as the M. Baxters
Aphorisms, in Explicat. Thesis. 69. page 277.
form of it, seeing it is impossible that such love should be in an
unregenerate person: for if it be, then either it is there without faith, and
to say this implies a manifest contradiction to the nature of the thing. For
how can the essential form of justifying faith be, where justifying faith is
not? Or if it be said that saveing faith and this love are both together in an
irregenerate man, this will be to say, that an injust, and irregenerate man
has justifying faith; which is no less a contradiction. (...) (as Barlaam de
Primatu. cap. 14. page 120. Editionis Salmasianae.
Barlaam said in the like case) How can these things consist with reason, or
sobriety?

Rat. 8. If common, and saveing belief be (as is affirmed) essentially the
same, then suppose Cajus (for instance) while he continues irregenerate, have
an Historical, or temporary faith, produced by reading the Gospel, the help
of good education, and industry, and afterward be regenerate; it follows,
that all which he has from the regenerateing Spirit of Christ, can be only a
greater degree of that faith, which (quoad totum esse) was in him before his
regeneration: and then justifying, and saveing faith, is not donum Dei quoad
esse, but only quoad gradum; so that the essence of saveing faith (and that
includeing a real love to Christ as our Lord and Savior) we shall owe to our
selves and natural abilities, and the degree only to the regenerating Spirit
of Christ: which is directly contrary to express Scripture, resolved to be so,
by the Ancient Church, and in terminis condemned (not by private men only, and
particular persons, but) by Vid. Council. Arausicanum. 2. Can. 4. 5, 6, 7, 8.

(too severely) determines -- Fidelis non est, nisi qui divinae erga se
benevolentiae promissionibus fretus, INDVBITATAM Salutis expectationem
praesumit.

In Answer to this, so far as it may concern our present purpose, I say,

1. It is not rational to put this (...), or Fiducia in the Definition of
saveing faith, it being manifest that this Fiducia is not an essential, but
graduall perfection of faith. It is (...), a higher measure, and degree of
saveing faith, such as all should labor after, though all are not so happy as
to have it, There is a Math. 6. 30, and 8, 26. Gal. 4. 19. Romans 14. 1. Grotius
in Math. 8. 26. Ostendit Christus (...) (i. e.) trepidam illam formidinem,
prolem esse (...) (...). Theophylact. in locum. page 45. C. (...). etc. Non
dicit incredulos, sed parvae fidei; nam cum dicunt, Demine serv^ nos, fidem
monstrant, quod autem dicunt, perimus, non est fidei, illo enim simul
navigante, non erat formidandum.
little, and Weak faith, (which may consist with doubteing,) as well as a
great, and strong faith, which has full assurance, and fiduciall confidence.
The weak faith of a doubting Christian may be as good, and sincerely true,
(though not as great) as his, who has fiduciall confidence. He that should
define Calidum, to be that which had Calor in gradu. 7. vel. 8. Were foully out
in Philosophy, seeing Calidum in gradu 6. aut. 7. Is as truly hott, as that in
an higher degree; and he is no less mistaken in Divinity that defines faith by
Fiducia, because there may be, (and many times is) true faith which is not in
so high a degree of perfection. As in the natural man there may be (...) (as
Hippocrates calls it) Deliquium Animi (in Celsus his language) a sowneing,
wherein a man is so far from being sure that he is alive, that he knows not at
all (for the present) that he lives: So there may be (in great temptations, and
desertions) spiritual sowneinges, and a (...), wherein even a good Christian
may be so for from assurance of Eternal, that he may doubt of his Spiritual
life, whether he be really in Christ or no.

2. But that this F^ducia is not in the will, nor is any Act of it, an
ingenuous, rational Rob. Baronius Exercit. 3. Art. 19.. 4. page 241.
person gives us. 2. Reasons.

1. Thus, Diffidence which is the formal opposite to Fiducia, or confidence)
is not in the will, but understandinge. ergo. Fiducia is there too. The
consequence is evident from the nature of such opposites, which are always
circa idem, and apta nata esse successive in eodem subjecto so if ignorance be
in the understandinge, science must be there too, if Caecitas be in the Eye,
Visus is there also. etc. So if diffidence be in the understanding, confidence
or Fiducia must of necessity be there too. Now that Diffidence is in the
understanding (not the will) he proves thus, (take it in his own words) Quia
diffidentia qua aliquis dicitur diffidere sibi, aut rebus suis, non significat
odium, aut aversationem voluntatis, sed out dubitationem de viribus suis, aut
per suasionem de imbecillitate sua quae proculdubio ad Intellectum pertinent.
And indeed he says true: for the proper Mediums whereby we work certainty and
confidence, or take away diffidence, are demonstrations, and certain, and
evidently concluding arguments (which the will is not capable of) whereby we
convince the understanding of the certain and necessary truth of any
conclusion, and that done, all diffidence, and doubting vanish, which is an
evident argument that diffidence and doubtings are formally in the
understanding, as their proper subject; being indeed adjuncts of our assent,
which is undeniably an act of our understandings, which assent with confidence
or diffidence according to the quality, and nature of those Mediums which the
understanding brings to move our assent to any conclusion. For if the Mediums
brought be only Topicall, and probable, then our assent is accompanied with
diffidence or doubting, according as those arguments carry a greater, or less
probability: it being a known and certain truth in Logique, that such Mediums
can produce only assensum opinativum, which is allwaies joined cum formidine
oppositi. But if the Arguments brought be demonstrative, they produce assensum
scientificum, which satissfyes the understanding, and absolutely excludes all
diffidence, and doubteings whatsoever. Whence it sollowes.

1. That seeing fiducia and diffidentia, confidence and diffidence are aojuncta
and gradus humani assensus, they must of necessity be in that faculty where
such assent is; that is, in the understanding.

2. That seeing those Mediums which expel, and take away diffidence, and
produce confidence, are only rational and intellectual, such as come not
within the compass of the proper, and formal object of the will, but are the
effect,and object of our understandings, it will be evident that both fiducia
and diffidentia. which are the product of such Mediums must be in the
understanding which alone (and not the will) is capable to be affected by them.

2. His second argument is this, which (that I may not wrong him, and confess
from whom I had it) I shall give you in his own words, thus -- Rob. Baron
Ubisupra exercit 3. Art. 19.. 4. page 241. Vide Tilenum in Syntagmat,. Part. 2.
Disput. 40. These. 16. and 77.
Fiducia est subjective in Intellectu: Quia si formaliter esset Actus
voluntatis, nihil aliud esset quam desiderium aur amor objecti: sed hoc est
quotidianae experientiae contrarium, multi enim ardenter amant, and desiderant
objectum aliquod, qui tamen non habent fiduciam de eo obtinendo. If Fiducia be
in the will, it must either be an ardent love, or desire of some object; and
then the more ardently we loved, or desired any object, we should be the more
fiducially confident to attain it; which is manifestly false, seeing all know,
that we may love, and desire earnestly many things, which we are so far from
being confident to attain, that many times we (against our wills) are sure
enough we shall never enjoy, or compass them.

3. In short, it is evident by the nature and use of the words in all good
Authors, that (...), fiducia, confidentia relate to the understauding and not
to the will. (...) (for so Budaeus verbo (...).
Budaeus would have it writ) (...), comperire, deprehendere, ut sit (...),
plena deprehensio, manifestum indicium. (...) apud Josephum; plena rei
investigatae perceptio. You see that the whole explication of the word relates
to the understanding. And again, (...), certior fio, exploratum habeo; Latini
dicunt, procerto scio (as the same Author tells us) sometimes they render the
words thus, (...), Hesychius verbo (...).
(...), Glossae Ver. per Bonav. Vulcanium. page 96
fiducia, (...) that is a firm assent without fear. and (...) confidentia.
And In Stephanus, (...), is persuasia, plena certioratio, still relateing to
the understanding. In Scripture it is yet more evident (if possible) where you
have Col. 2. 2
(...), fulness, certainty, or confidence of knowledge, and Luke 1. 1.
(...), things certainly known. Once more (to put it out of all doubt) The
Romans 4. 21.
Apostle exhorts the Romans to a fiduciall confidence, (...), let every one be
fully, fiducially persuaded, and it is (...) in his own mind, or
understanding. Whence I conclude that this (...), or fiducia (we now speak of)
is not in the will, but understanding. I shall add no more but a saying of the
incomparable L. Viscount Falkland in his Defense of his Tract of Infallibility
against his Adversary Father. H.
L. Viscount Falkland to his Catholic Adversary, (in the like case) He that
after all this, (and much more which might be said) shall still say Fiducia is
in the will, I will not say he is impudent, but sure a little thing will not
make him blush.

Lastly, That I may (in obedience to your command) clearly give you my
opinion, I do really believe.

1. That. this Assertion [Common and special grace are essentially the same]
is not only erroneous, but far more dangerous then many (nay most men) think;
especially those, who (in Questistions of this nature) want ability, or time to
consider, and know the consequences of it.

2. I believe, that the other proposition, [That Majoristae quoque detestandi
sunt quia miscent fidem and dilectionem in ipso actu justifications. Tileman,.
He-shusius in I Cor. 13. Page 268.
charity is essential to justifying faith] is a worse mistake then the former,
(in respect of the many ill consequences which inevitably follow it) not only
improbable, but indeed impossible, repugnant to the plain, and known
principles of true Divinity, and Philosophy too; as has already been evidenced
by many, and further may, and shall ((...)) when there is necessity or any just
opportunity to do it.

I confess there are. 2. sorts of Heretics (pardon me, if I call a spade a
spade, and a stone a stone) which make charity essential to faith.

effect, and consequent of it. As is, and may be evident to any who will not
shut their eyes against the clear light, which scripture, and nature afford
us. Now I conceave (with all humble submission to better judgments) that both
these opinions are demonstrately untrue, as has been showed by many here,
tofore, and (if I mistake not much) in part even in these present papers, and
further might much more, were it hujus loci, aut pensi.

times, wherein charity in cold, and our dissentions hott; in a time wherein
every one may (as the Historian said in another case) Sentire quae velit, and

(I fear) loose scrible. Which (though nothing else) may signify thus much;
that I am more willinge, then able to serve you, and have a great confidence in
your goodness, and candor, seeing I dare, and do trust you with all my
infirmityes. For the discourse it self, I give you absolute power over it; you
may burn, or preserve, read it your self only, or communicate it to others.
Only I shall (for some reasons) des^^e you to conceal my name, not that
leither doubt of the truth, or am ashamed, or afraid to own it for if
occasion be, I shall both own, and vindicate it) but that the meanness and
inconsiderablenesse of my parts, and person, may be no prejudice to it. I am
far from having any such high opinion of this hasty scrible, or the reasons
contained in it, as to think them of that strengh, or evidence, that they will
convert M. Baxter, or any else of a contrary judgment; yet I believe they are
such, as may move them to a further explication, and confirmation of their new,
and (I believe) untrue hypothesis. If any shall think either me, or the
reasons I have tumultuarily put together so considerable as to deserve an
answer; I shall be obliged to them for their good opinion, and the honor they
will do me by a confutation. But withal, I must desire them not to fall too
severaly on mistakes by the by, (of which there may be many in this little
pamphlet) but heartily, and really answer to the maine of this discourse;
otherwise I must crave leave to tell him (whoever he be that shall trouble
himself to give an answer to this discourse) that if he do it with
animosity, passion, or impertinency, he may have my prayers, and pity, but no
reply -- potui bonas horas non sic perdere, I have other business then to
trouble my self with any reply to any man's passion; railing or rhetorique
signify nothing to me, but that the man wants reason, and better arguments that
uses them. But if any with that civility and meakenesse which becomes a man
(much more a Christian) shall heartily, and rationally answer this paper,
evidently overthrowing my reasons, and making good his own; I shall be so far
from being angry with him, or making any reply, that I shall thank God, and
him for discovering to me my error, and publikly acknowledge my self to be his
disciple. and thankful Profelyte.
