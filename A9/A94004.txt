STRANGE NEWS FROM Bishops-Stafford, NEAR BUCKINGHAM.
LICENSED, April 26th, 1694.
AMidst the various Clans of Enthusiasts who being led astray through blind ways
by their distempered Brains and fantastic Notions. the Wills in the Whisp,
which they mistake for a true light, none seem more positive of being guided
right, and conscquently more stubborn and daring than those I am going to give
you an account of.

One Mason, Minister of Bishops-Stafford, near Buckingham, a Man of a very good
Life and Reputation, however now disordered, affirmed to his People, that our
Savior appeared to him on Monday the 16th of this instant April in his
Chamber, and told him, that he should appear publicly on Earth at Pentecost,
and judge sinners: This Story, and the Sanctity of the Man, so wrought upon the
unthinking Multitude, that they flock every day into the Fields in great
Companies, employing their time Night and Day in dancing and singing
Hallelujahs, in expectation of his coming to Reign on Earth; when the Sinners
are to be trampled under foot, and the Righteous to be all brought to
Bishops-Stafford, from whence they are to take a Progress to Jerusalem, and in
their way to call in all the wandering Jews. They have prepared a great many fat
Beasts to make a Sacrifice, and are so positive of the truth of this, that it is
almost dangerous to contradict them; whole Families, Men, Women and Children,
leaving their Habitations together, as if they had utterly done with all
Affairs of this World. Their Number at first was but small, but in a few days
increased to Two Hundred, and I have since received news that they are
multiplied to Five; and I imagine that nothing but finding their own Folly will
be able to convince them; so that when their Tarantula is over, we may expect
them and their Pastor to return to their several Vocations, and wait the good
hour with as much patience as other People.

Had I not received this Account from a Man of undoubted Reputation, my Friend,
I should scarce have credited it: But I hope this Paper may be secured from the
Character of being Grubstreet, since it is in the power of every Person that
pleases, in a few hours, to satisfy himself of the truth of this Relation; who
himself concludes with this Sentence, after he himself had been to see them, on
Monday the 23d of this instant, Such a strange Sight, such Confusion and
Madness, I never expected to see, unless in Bedlam.
