TO THE HONORABLE, THE HOUSE OF COMMONS NOW ASSEMBLED IN PARLIAMENT.
The humble Petition of the High Sheriff, Knights, Esquires, Gentlemen,
Ministers, Freeholders, and Inhabitants of the County of Sussex.

HVMBLY SHOWS,
THat your Petitioners having suffered in as deep a nature, both in our
Religion, Laws, Estates, and Liberties, as the many thousands of our Brethren,
who have already made known their condition to this Honorable Assembly:
Notwithstanding we cannot but thankfully acknowledge the benefits which we have
received already by your unwearied labors, faithful endeavors, and undanted
resolutions against all delays, desperate plots upon your Persons, Estates,
and Liberties; many heavy taxes we are eased of; much freedom we enjoy in our
Consciences and livelihood; defending us from the violent cruelties, and
formidable power of the Prelates and their Courts, making good our Laws against
Treasons end evil Counsels, maintaining the true Religion and the glory of it,
maugre the endeavors of Arminians, Bishops, ill-affected Clergy, and others,
and the distructive plots of Papists, and the power of popish Lords, opening
the mouths of faithful Ministers long since silenced, enlarging those who were
in prison and exile; appointing Lieutenants of trust; providing relief for
distressed Ireland, the crying object of pity, and subject of our enemies
cruelty, our humble desires are above all.

That the Laws of God be truly maintained; Government and Discipline so settled,
that we may conform therein, to the perfect rule of Gods word; able, learned,
and painful Ministers may be encouraged, scandalous, speedily displaced;
Pluralities and unwarranted orders and dignities of the Clergy taken away; that
the probates of Wills and Testaments, may be reserved to the cognizance of the
Temporal Courts; that places of concernment in the Kingdom, may be in the
hands of Persons of integrity and good conversation; Papists may be totally
disarmed, the Persons confined, the subtle conveyances of there estats
discovered, and prevented; secret evil Counsels and Counselors taken away
from His Majesty; Delinquents punished; sale of Honor, and Offices restrained:
That our County, more then seventy miles, naked to the Sea, may speedily be put
into a posture of warlike defense by Sea and Land; Seamen encouraged, fishing
maintained, Ireland farther relieved, the Clergy, and others disobeying your
late Orders in our Cathedral, and other Churches, questioned, the Universities
thoroughly purged, the Mass utterly abolished.

For the perfecting of which, and all other your honorable endeavors, that
the glory of God may be by your zealous and loyal intentions propagated, The
honor and safety of his Majesly and his Kingdoms, advanced, the privileges
of Parliament, and every Member thereof maintained; We shall never be wanting
with our prayers, lives, and estates, according to our Protestation, to give
you our uttermost assistance.
