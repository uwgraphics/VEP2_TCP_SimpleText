Reader,
PEruse the ensuing Votes, and then subscribe the new intended Representative,
or Agreement of the People, without perjury and breach of Covenant, if thou
can; being thrice by the House of Commons, and once by both Houses adjudged
and declared to be destructive to the being of Parliaments, and to the
fundamental Government of the Kingdom, which thou both by the Protestation,
and Solemn League and Covenant art obliged inviolably to maintain: and no less
then High Treason, as was adjudged this very Parliament by both Houses, in the
Cases of Strafford and Canterbury, who lost both their Heads for endeavoring
to subvert the Liberties and Freedom of Parliaments, and the fundamental
Government of the Kingdom: of whose Treasons these must certainly be more
deeply guilty, who shall promote and set up this Agreement, after these Votes
of both Houses against it.

AFter this both Houses of Parliament by an Ordinance of December. 17. 1647.
concerning the choosing of Common-Councel-men and other Officers of the City of
London, Ordained, That no person whatsoever who has continued, abetted, or
persuaded or entered into that Engagement, entitled, The Agreement of the
people, declared TO BE DESTRUCTIVE TO THE BEING OF PARLIAMENT, and FUNDAMENTAL
GOERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM; shall for the space of one whole year, to be
accounted from the 15 of December, 1647. be elected, chosen, or, put into the
Office or place of Lord Major of the City of London, or of Alderman, Sheriff,
Deputy of a Ward, or Common-Councel-man of the said City, nor shall have voice
in the election of any such Officers.

These Votes and Ordinances were passed whiles the eleven Members, and most of
the Presbyterians were secluded and absent from the House, by Lieutenant
General Crumwel, Ireton, and the Independent-party, who now endeavor to set up
that very Agreement, which they then thus deemed and censured.

William Prynne.
