A Second Message to his Grace a CANTERBURY.
My Lord,
OF late a letter to your Grace was sent;
Which now I hear gives you much discontent;
Your rage and fury waxed wondrous hot,
And would the author curb, but yet could not,
For want of power, which of late you had,
Which makes you grieve to see it, makes us so glad;
O could your lofty mind mount up again,
You Would persecute good Christians amain;
But stay my Lord, no thing so sure as this,
Laud must e're long the block or gibbet kiss:
Therefore in vain it is for you to vex,
For'twill but more and more your mind perplex,
I Am sure 'twas true that he writ to your grace
And I will justify it to your face,
Nay all the world can justify beside,
That all is true, and you are not belide;
It may be you will say it was too tart,
Remembe^ then that you made one man smart
With heavy punishment though'twas not he
That did offend against your majesty,
For he along the fields simply did walk,
And with the Prentices he never did talk,
And yet you caused the poor man lose his life
As though he had bin causer of that strife;
What though he were, did he deserve such death,
As to have stopped the passage of his breath?
Nay more then this which grieves me to relate,
He quartered was, and hanged at each gate:
Well'twas my Lord unjustly done I Am sure,
And therefore fit you something should endure;
Then be not angry at the words we write,
When from the dark we bring you to the light,
For all this while in darkness you lived in,
But in th'light you would walked it had better bin,
And then you might in State have lived still,
But self to ruin brought by doing ill;
Perchance you will not confess, but say'tis no
Such matter as we do against you show,
But that you think your crimes we will aggravate,
Because so suddenly your pulled from State;
Alas'twas time that you from State should fall!
For else you would have brought us under thrall:
I dare be bold to say, yout hought e're now,
To make all England to your altars bow,
You took a speedy course, yea that is most true,
And always favored that most wicked crew,
I mean the Papists who have ever sought,
With wicked plots to bring our land to naught;
But they nor all the wicked pangs in hell,
Our blessed Gospel ever shall expel;
For now you see to naught their plots God bring
That they never can accomplish any thing.
For God above who sits an eyes them all,
Even at the utmost time, makes them to fall.
For when they'ave gotten to the height of pride,
Unlikely it is that they should long abide,
For at the last they ever tumble down
To The ground, with all their honor and renown,
Examples far I need not go to show,
Your self is one, and others of your crew,
But for all this perhaps you still will say,
You aimed at Englands good when you bore sway,
But'tis not true my Lord I will avoucht
For then to altars you had never croucht,
Nor had you bowed then unto Jesus name,
In outward adoration of the same;
Whenas that all our best and godli'st men,
This outward adoration do condemn,
Nor had you then so wickedly abused,
Such godly men as pious preaching used:
Well then my Lord here convict of sin
For you have done most wickedly therein
And all your deeds continually were evil,
Which savored not of God but of the devil,
Whose slave yo've bin this many years I Am fraid,
And wickedly his banners have displaid;
Now to requite your pains, he you has brought
Unto that woe that you would never have thought,
For if three years ago one had told you
That you must fall and all your wicked crew,
Tush, tush, you would say I will not it believe,
That till I die, mine honor I shall leave:
But now you see your honor you have lost,
And of your wicked projects you are crossed:
Well then, My Lord, your misery lament,
And God of's mercy grant you may repent.
A POSTSCRIPT TO THOMAS HERBERT, Author of that foolish and Ridiculous answer
to Mercuries Message.
HOw now what is this laid open to our view,
Some foolish Pamphlet of the Popish crew?
But is it no worse, I Am sure it is no better,
The Titles called an Answer to a Letter,
Wherein the Author does his venom spit,
And proves himself, dissembling Hypocrit;
Hypocrisy he often does relate,
But to his shame, I speak't, it is his own state,
For right, for wrong, for any thing heel be,
For truth, for error, or Hypocrisy;
His wits he always bends for to devise
Some wicked thing that is nothing else but lies:
Mark and behold his Hypocriticke str^ine,
How he does fl^tter the bad and good disdain,
When he begins at first he stands am^z'd
But presently his lying muse he razed,
And first the Scriptures to his own ends rests,
And counts that worst, which all men counts best,
Namely, at the Name of Jesus we should bow,
Does not says he the Scripture it allow,
(...) men of better judgment then his grace,
D^e not ^xpound such meaning or that place:
B^^ nowadaies the Scriptures much abused,
(...) very boy that here before it used.
N^x^ after that he talks of ten p^und bribe,
W^tch he for want of that was c^us'd to scribe
B^^lads and Books for that is all his trade,
And amongst the rest of late this answer m^de:
But it matters no^, for no man took it well,
But c^unt^d 'twas a wicked deed of hell,
And for the short hair'd crew which he counts ill,
It not deceived, the same's his Master WILL:
And for his part, we know him very well,
His long shag'd locks, and tattered coat him tell,
F^r R^putation he can have no more,
H^e's run so deeply in the Chandlers score,
And those sociats with whom he is partaker,
A^ best they are but wretched b^llad makers.
Indeed Tom Herbert he did wondrous well,
That at the latter end his name did tell,
For now it is told ^broad that he did write
An answer to a Letter out of spite:
What has he got for this his wicked deed,
But lost his name for want of taking heed,
For ^ot a bad words in it that Author writ,
But he does know he has deserved it.
And now my lines I Will leave to all men's view,
My Muse shall cease, but heel be paid his due.
The Authors Answer will come forth ere long,
And cut and flash him deep, but wont him wrong,
Heel speak the truth, and stop his mouth for ever,
That he it answer cant, with his best endeavor;
But if he do, I know 'twill be so lame,
That no wise man will read it ore for shame,
My Muse to write of thee again shall rest,
Mine own, not yours, for so I hold it best
FINIS.
