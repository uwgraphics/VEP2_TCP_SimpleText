To the Right Honorable the House of Peers, assembled in Parliament.
The humble Petition of the County of Southampton.
Most humbly shows,
THat, according to Gods Word, whereof one tittle shall not fail, A Kingdom, or
House divided, cannot stand: dissension and discord subvert and ruin the most
potent Monarchs, and flourishing Estates in the world; but Peace and Religion
are the works of absolute perfection, which being united, make a State
unconquerable. To finish this work, is worthy your Honors most serious
employment, which we conceive cannot be effected, whilst the popish Lords, who
are manifest enemies to both, are admitted to vote amongst you, and therefore
their consent cannot be expected. They are Papists, who have raised Rebellion
in Ireland, and desire nothing more than the utter destruction of all that
profess the Protestant Religion; and have most mercilesly imbrued their hands
in the blood of very many of them: and we are confident, That the Priests and
Papists in this Kingdom are confederate with them, and would do the like
execution here; and had prevailed in their frequent attempts, if God in his
mercy had not prevented their devilish plots to our preservation.

Wherefore we earnestly pray (their malice being so apparently known) that the
Popish Lords Votes may be taken away, and all Papists confined; for while they
are at liberty, they will be ever contriving new mischiefs, to bring us to
confusion. We further beseech you, That you will be pleased to join with the
House of Commons, in advising and petitioning His sacred Majesty to reside near
his Parliament, And that care be speedily taken that the Prince may be near
London, and have Education answerable to his high Birth and State; That Ireland
may be relieved, The Seas guarded with a strong Fleet, Our Castles and Forts
prepared for defense against foreign or domestic enemies; The Privileges of
Parliament maintained, which are the chiefest and most real Inheritance,
purchased and left to us by the great care and prowess of our Ancestors; which
we, with the like zeal and affection, intend to preserve to our posterity, most
inviolable from all enforcements. And as we do acknowledge with all
thankfulness your indefatigable labors, in composing the distracted estate of
this Kingdom, of which we have lately had very good experience, especially in
your Lordships Noble concurrence with the Honorable House of Commons in taking
away the Votes of Bishops, and settling many other things of great concernment,
So we shall faithfully, according to our Duty and Protestation, with our lives
and Fortunes, defend his Royal Majesty, and your Honors, agreeing with the
House of Commons, from all dangers, with our utmost power.

To the Honorable, the House of Commons now assembled in Parliament.
The humble Petition of the high-Sheriffe, Knights, Esquires, and Gentlemen of
the grand-Inquest, Ministers, Freeholders and inhabitants of the County of
Southampton, at the general Assizes.
Humbly shows,
THat your Petitioners do with all humble thankfulness and admiration,
acknowledge the unwearied endeavors of this Honorable House, for the
re-establishment of truth and peace amongst us, notwithstanding the malignant
opposition of the popish and Prelaticall party, and are truly and thoroughly
sensible of the blessings we enjoy in the suppression of Arbitrary Government,
Settling Trienniall Parliaments, Disvoting Bishops, with many other great things
expressed in your Remonstrance, which it has pleased the Lord to effect for
us, by your Noble means, whereof we rejoice.

That nevertheless when we consider the great and manifold dangers that yet
threaten this Kingdom, by invasion from foreign parts, and by our own
divisions at home, caused by the Votes of Popish Lords in the House of Peers,
The continual practices of their adherents in the Country, And nakedness for
defense; The corruptions yet remaining in the Church, The deplorable condition
of our dear brethren in Ireland: particularly, when we reflect upon our own
County, consisting of near 250 Parishes, whereof we fear there is not a ^ifth
part furnished with conscionable, constant Preaching Ministers: Unto which
Spiritual calamity, we may add the hazard we run in our Lives and Estates,
through the decays in our Castles and Forts, Our want of Ammunition, Weakness
of our Trained Bands, Multitudes of Papists, not only residing there, but
resorting hither from other places, the ruin of Trades, and particularly of
Clothing, for which the people of these parts have formerly derived their
greatest subsistence.
