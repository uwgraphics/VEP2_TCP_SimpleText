A most ELEGANT and RELIGIOUS RAPTURE, COMPOSED By Mr. Samuel Ward (that
sometime famous and pious Pastor at Ipswich) during his Episcopal Imprisonment
in the GATE-HOVSE, And by him Dedicated to King CHARLES the First. Now, Most
exactly Englished by JOHN VICARS.
Precatiuncula de Theologico Magnete, Jesu Christo, ad rhythmi Bernardini,
genium and formam.
MAgne Magnes, Me dignare,
Ad Te totum inclinare;
Fac Cor meum anhelare,
Vt Se possit applicare
Devoto Tibi pectore.
Canem vilem, allatrantem,
Ovem perditam, balantem;
Cervum fessum, anhelantem,
Servum tardum, and cunctantem,
Potenter ad Te pertrahe.
Sic Me trahas, ut Te sequar,
Sic convertas, ut convertar;
Cordi meo Te conjungas,
Vngas illud, and compungas,
Spiritus tui flamine,
Per medullam Cordis mei,
Peccatoris, atque rei;
Sic Vis tua tramittatur,
Vt, Cor totum constringatur,
Amoris tui Vinculis.
Da Cor, Cordi similari,
Da Cor, Cordi sociari;
Da Cor durum perforari,
Da Cor ferreum sauciari,
Amoris tui Vulnere.
Meum posse, velle, scire,
Totum Tibi fac servire;
Vehementer esurire,
Et ardenter Te sitire,
Fac Cor meum aridum.
Rosa Sharon aperire,
Cujus Odor fragrat, mire;
Nares meas fac sentire
Illas, illum fac haurire,
Prae cunctis Suavitatibus.
Manna dulce, Mel sincerum,
Vinum suave, Nectar merum;
In Quo, Nihil est amarum,
Esto, Mihi, Tu, per-charum,
Prae omnibus Deliciis.
Ecce, Tibi appropinquo,
Parce Mihi, si delinquo;
Ecce, curro ad Te, sponte,
Verecunda, tamen front,
Ne, Me, quaeso, rejice.
Praebe, Mihi, Te benignum,
Ne repellas Me indignum;
Totum, ad Te, Cor impelle,
Totum impelle meum Velle,
Vt, Te, nunquam, deseram.

A short and sweet Prayer concerning the Theological Lodestone, Christ Jesus,
according to St Bernards manner and Meter.
LOvely Lodestone, grant to Me,
Wholely, solely, Thine to be;
Make my Heart for Thee to breath,
That it may It Self bequeath
With all fervor unto Thee.
Me, a base, a barking Hound,
Bleating Sheep, strayed from my Bound;
Me, a panting, chased Deer,
Servant slack, and slow, most near,
Strongly draw, to follow Thee.
So Me draw, as to keep nigh Thee,
So, Me turn, as turned by Thee;
O Unite Thee to my Heart,
And anoint It, make It smart,
With thy holy Spirits blast.
Through the marrow of my Soul,
A poor Sinner guilty, foul;
So, Thy Power, O Lord, transmit,
As my Heart to Thee to knit,
With thy pleasing Love-chains, fast.
Give Me such a Heart as Thine,
Give my Heart to Thee to join;
Give Me my hard-Heart pierced quite,
Give't, though iron-hard, contrite,
By thy piercing Wound of Love.
My Power, my Will, and All I know,
Whole Obedience make to show;
Deadly hungry Christ's to be,
Eagerly to thirst for Thee,
My dry parched Soul, O, move!
Spread, Thou Rose of Sharon, fairly,
Whose sweet Savor sents, most rarely;
Fill my Nosthrils with Thy Sent,
Drawing from Thee more Content,
Than from Earths Sweets, when at Fairest.
Sweetest Manna, Honey clear,
Pleasant Wine, and Nectar mere;
And thou Sweet, where is Nothing bitter,
O, may I count Nothing fitter
Than Thee, for my Soul's All-rarest!
Lo, I come, I fly to Thee,
Spare, if ought offensive be;
Lo, I run to Thee, apase,
Yet, with bashful, blushing face,
O, refuse Me not, I pray.
Show thy Self to Me propitious,
Shun Me not, though I be vicious;
Fully draw my Heart to Thee,
Fully fill Its Longs for Thee,
That, from Thee, I never stray.
J. V.

VOTUM MAGNETICUM, vel, Ejusdem Samuelis Ward, Votum devotum, de eodem Magnete
Theologico, Jesu Christo.
PSALM. 27. 4. Multa petunt a Te Multi, Queis multa dedisse,
Multum laesisse est; Sunt, Mihi, Pauca satis.
Pauca petunt a Te Pauci; Mihi Sussicit Luc. 10. 42.
Vnum;
Vnum si dederis, non Ego Plura petam.
Hoc opus est (...). Vno opus est.
Vnum, Satis Vnum, Plus-satis Vnum;
Vnum si dederis Tu, Mihi, Dives ero.
Hoc Vnum petii, repetam, bis, terque, quaterque;
Vnum si dederis Tu Mihi, gratus ero.
Vt trahar, utque traham ad Christum, Quos, morte redemit,
Vnum hoc si dederis Tu, Mihi, Mill dabis.
Mill Tibi grates persolvam, Votaque reddam
Mill, Tibi; Lauds, secula, mill, canam. Amen.

A DEVOVT VOTE, or, The holy Wish of the same Mr Samuel Ward, touching the
foresaid Theological Load stone, Christ Jesus.
PSALM. 27. 4. LORD, Many ask Thee Much, to whom, Much, if had,
Would do much hurt; Few Things would make Me glad.
Few ask Thee few Things, Luke 10. 42.
One would Me complete:
Give Me that One Thing. I Will no more entreat.
This One thing is needful.
One I need, One fills, makes Me run-ore;
Give me this One-Thing, Christ, and I have Store.
This One I crave, will crave twice, thrice, again;
This One-Thing granted, grateful I Will remain.
That I, once brought, to Christ, his Saints may bring,
This one Grace given me, Hence, a Thousand spring.
For This a Thousand Thanks, and Vows I Will pay;
To thee ten thousand Praises sing, for aye. Amen.
J. V.
