restoration, and satisfaction of all Interests.

The SPIRITUAL MADMAN, OR A PROPHESI, CONCERNING THE KING.
THe Army is a particular part of the Kingdom, and that temporary, and
occasional; and is by the bright shining of the Sun of Righteousness, melted
into a general peace and unity; but lying under a particular condemnation, it
shall receive a particular discharge. And we know thy employment is so irksome
and unpleasant to thee, To be the kingdoms Jailer, to keep War in, and peace
out; or to stand in the way to the Tree of life, with a flaming sword; to keep
men from the enjoyment of their Liberty, KING, Peace; though thou art commanded
to it by God (these things being yet forbidden the people,) yet thou will be
glad to be released from it; that thou and all other may come into the Paradise
of God, and feed together upon the fruit of Divine peace and love.

There is under thy assuming power over the Kingdom, King, and Parliament, and
all; and in thy maintaining thy Mi^i^ary power above, and against the Civil;
in thy seeking thy own subsisting, and attempting to be the Kingdoms Lord and
restorer: The Lord clothing himself with zeal, as with a garment,
incompassing himself about with flames of fire: A Man of War: a Lord of Hosts:
Casting away his Fatherly Government, because of the Nations rebellion in all
parts against himself, and ruling us with a Rod of Iron. God marching before
us, out of Egypts slavery, into a Wilderness; turning us from a Civil
Government into a Wilderness; and incamping in the midest of us, and
administering Laws to us; as at Sinai: in thundering and lightning, clouds and
darkness; so rerrible, that makes all tremble: A yoke that neither we, nor our
Fathers are able to bear: And so we see Gods severity, under man's iniquities:
And because it is the Lords Rod, we kiss the Rod, and love you for it.

Death is proper for this administration: The Lord our Husband, the Law dies;
we were bound to honor you so long as you lived in the power and goodness of
God; The whole Kingdom bowed before you; while you led us safely through the
Wilderness; But Moses cannot bring us into Canaan; but must only have a view of
it, and dye at mount Nebo: This power is weak through the flesh, and cannot do
it; if you contend now to effect any thing, it is but the Devil striving for
the body of Moses, you are laboring to set up an honorable carcass; or to
call back life into a dead body: Christ did come into it, and has offered it
up in his own body, and naild this power fast to the Tree; you are dead, fixed
to the tree of shame, by the curse with your Lord; and by death you shall
overcome more then ever you overcame by life; submitting to death, your wills,
reasons, lusts; your seeking a worldly Kingdom; your desire of Lording it over
others by force of arms, with all your projects, are slain; and all enmity in
you against others, and others against you.

Death has Disbanded you; easd you of your hellish and wrathful employment:
Reconciled you to all, and all to you; brought you from being Turkish
Janisaries, to be English men: You are dissolved into a body of love; into
GOD: you lie down in the Eternal.

By this your arreares are paid; you are nothing, you are dead, and you can
require nothing; you, and your demands are fallen to the ground; your service
is dead, and nothing is due to it, but to be buried, and all your miscarriages,
in forgetfulness. Who do you require arreares of? The Kingdom is dead; the
sword reigns, and therefore the Kingdom is free: if you will be paid; take
blood, want, spoil, Confusion, ruin: that is all that is left of the Kingdom;
pay your selves of that. Do you expect it of the Parliament? That is dead too.
Poor Parliament, you have eat it up your selves in greediness of pay, you
tore her bowels out; and you can have no more.

But all anger is past, there remains nothing but love: you are dead, and live
with Christ: come forth of your graves; stand up in the resurrection of the
Christ, in union and fellowship with Christ. The Lords host; now the Lord is in
you; and you pitch your tents about the Lord; and are the arm of God,
stretched out for his own defense, and for the punishing of transgressors
living in the strength and Spirit of the Lord: and now, mighty and powerful to
execute divine pleasure: Now you are under the Captain of our salvation; and at
one interested in the salvation of the Nation; and of Christ, our Savior

Now we can pay you arreares: you never stuck upon arreares till you sunk into
the earth, into poor earthly minds; rise you again into spirit, you will count
it your honor to help England freely: Money and a Savior, cannot subsist
together. That Spirit of Christ that once acted in you to let go the Prisoners,
Englands freedom and justice, without price or reward: that spirit shall
revive in you: and then you will scorn to be mercinary.

I know you disdain to keep Englands wounds open to suck her blood: you have
hazarded your lives for justice and freedom, and cannot now insist upon pay: you
are worthy your selves, and have the worth of all with you: if you desire pay,
enter with us into Canaan. and you shall have Vineyards that you planted not;
wels that you diged not: A land flowing with milk and honey; such mercies and
blessings as you could not expect: The Lord is Judge, he will audite your
accounts, and pay all that he owes you: Religion flourishing in the purity of
it; peace and righteousness as Rivers and Seas; the sweet, holy, unmolested
enjoyment of your own families and estates, in the presence and under the
government of the most high: You shall now subsist in our bowels, be dissolved
into the Church and Kingdom, which is the beloved of Christ: Terrible as an
Army with banners: terrible to the world, and the God of the world: to the
Prince of darkness: and so we shall disband you into spirit and power; the
whole Nation shall be Soldiers able to draw the sword of the spirit against
all foreign power; amongst our selves wars shall cease from the earth: you
must beat your sword into plow shares, an^ spears into pruming-ho^kes: to your
honest trades again; there will need no Iron or steely wrath, but to plow up
your own hearts, and to cut down enemies within your own breasts. All our Towns
and Cities are garisoned with a heavenly host, and we have salvation for our
walls and bulwarks; we shall lie down in peace, and none make us afraid: while
we need force we shall use you, but not in civil wars, you must be removed,
and only employed in service against strangers: if you delight to sit down by
the still streams of Englands peace, and feed in our green pastures of
eternal love, you shall: if your valor makes you desirous of military
actions, we shall find enemies abroad to employ your swords against: and when
you undertake such expeditions the Lord shall go with you: you shall have
Angels spirits that shall make you invincible where ever you go.

The Levellers grew out of the Army, and are again shrunk into the Army, and
therefore we will now join you to the Army, being mingled together. In your
endeavor to impose your Democracy, your popular Government upon the Kingdom;
overthrowing and overcurning all powers into the People: We hear the void of
one crying in the Wilderness ( England is become a Wilderness) all flesh is
grass (all power is corrupt) the Spirit of the Lord has blown upon it and
its withered: This is John Baptist that exalts the valleys and brings down the
hills: he brings all into the waters the People; God is in these Levellers
casting the Mountains into the depths of the Seas, plunging all into a confused
People; not suffering one stone to lie upon another.

Thy place is to be in the Wilderness, and not to come into the City: to
expire and dye speedily, to decrease, that he that comes after may increase:
Thou art beheaded, thy devices are fallen to the ground, a mushrome, thou were
little, and art nothing. What went you out to see? A reed shaken with the wind:
growing out of the mire of the Nation: or a man clothed with soft raiment?
People got into Kings houses. In this state thou art vanished, lost, and raised
in the spirit of Christ, the divine and eternal love of God: and in this
Kingdom there is a perfect Level: The People the original of the Parliament
and King, by a free giving up themselves and their Estates to the Parliament
and King, are in the King and Parliament, and fully partake of the royalty and
power of both; and are leveld with it: The people give honor and glory to the
King, and so higher then he, or he their Subject: He that gives, is greater
then he that receives: Here all the people are one with that spirit that is
kingly that Anointing that makes Christ King: and so called mine Anointed
living all in the liberty of that spirit that makes Kings: and are most
perfectly content in the Kings greatness, being that which themselves
constitute: making it themselves, they live in it and enjoy it: And the King is
levelled to the people by his sufferings or humiliations, and by his love
taking in every Subject to himself: humbling of himself, to be but the Kingdoms
Servant, and wearing his Crown only for the happiness and good of the people,
living together, and brought into one body, head, and member. The eternal love
is the Leveller, Divine Charity that lifts not up it self, but is lifted up;
and being lifted up, draws all after it.

I rejoice in the healing thy breaches, oh London, thou honorable City: Thy
iniquities have been great, there is a righteous one under them that will carry
them without the City as a escape Goat into the wilderness: we see the Lord in
thee in thy greatest filth; in thy violent enforcing powers above thee to thy
own mind, in constraining the Parliament to thy will, by bold Petitions urged
with tumults: we see darkened and shadowed the intercession of the Son of God,
who with violence wrests from his Father favor for himself and his people: he
comes with boldness to take what he asks, and says, I will; and the power
that Saints have in Christ to command God in prayer. In thy siding with the
Parliament against the King, and thy free pouring forth thy self for her: We
see the excessive love of Christ to his Church, who is ravished with love, and
for her forgets all things else: In thy engrossing the riches of the Kingdom
into thee; thou are a shadow of Christ, who treasures up wealth and riches of
glory in the City of God for ur.

But thy glory is gone, thy true life; the beautiful presence of God has left
thee; and thou art burning in flames of wrath, jealousies, envies, divisions:
thou art wasted into a sceleton; thy trade obstructed by Sea and Land; thy
People filled with rage, thy bowels pained with fierce contests of parties,
pulling various ways; quite restless, an unquiet Sea, in continual
agitation. The Lord dies in thee, the Lords delight; thou were his spouse: thy
glory and greatness, it was the Lords; he suffers in thy suffering, and is
covered in thy ashes; lies under the burden of all thy wants, is pierced with
the necessities of the poor: And thou art in the dust of confusion; a ruinous
heap, the seat and place of vexation, lying in a thick cloud of darkness. But
his fire purifies thee; in these flames thou losest thy filthy pride,
covetousness, malice, revenge, etc.

Thou shall not perish utterly; The voice of God is heard in thee to revive
thee: thou shall be built again: Thy foundation shall be all of precious
stones, etc. The glory of God shall shine in thee, thou art now the City of
God; a righteous City: this is thy name, The Lord is there: The Lord displaies
his glory in the midst of thee: The new Jerusalem in deed, in truth, in spirit,
in perfect union with God; a heaven, and so in union amongst your selves; Peace
within thy walls, and plentiousnesse in thy palaces: a City at unity in it
self; there shall not be the least found of discord in thee: Thy nature is
love, light and holiness; The City of the great King: made happy by the
presence of the King, and all the state and honor of the Kingdom: Now open thy
arms of Divine love, and take into thy embraces the glory of England, Kings,
Princes, Nobility, Gentry, Ministry, Judges, Lawyers, with all the wisdom,
justice, power and excellency of heaven and earth; let all flock together; in
one God, one Christ, one spirit, one City, and thousands of thousands of Saints
and Angels dwelling in thee. Nothing shall be heard in thee but mirth and joy
in the Lord our God; praises of the great King: Open thy gates, thy everlasting
doors, that the King of glory, the Lord of Hosts, with all his host of
Princely powers, may enter in: And all the riches of the world shall slow into
thee in thy trade, naturally, and abundantly: the wealth of both I^dies, and
all parts, shall seek unto thee, and offer up it self to satisfy thee: thou
shall be crowned with blessings; all contents and pleasures shall continually
run down thy streets, and all in the sight and face of the holy God; in the
pure River of life.

All the works of God are perfect, found out of all them that take pleasure
therein: The greatest and highest, are reserved for us, in this later, and
great day of God; wherein it pleases the Lord to appear in his fullest, and
most excellent glory* this of Englands salvation is a sweet bud of it; a little
taste of that infinite Majesty that is now breaking forth, in the glorious
^ppearing of God. In this business, the Lord satisfies his own Interest, who
is Alphis, and Omega, the first. and the last: and this is the root of our
pleasure that thou art pleased, and satisfied.

Thou reignest, thou art King: this is thy due, all power and dominion is
thine; it is thy right to have all, all are thine* for thee they were created and
made, King, Parliament, Lords, Commons, Ministers, People, all sorts, all
sides, all parties are the Lords, and thou will reign over and in all: from Sea
to Sea, from one end of the Earth to the other, as lightening, shining from
East to West: so is thy Kingdom; and thy glory is now due to thee, that thou
should appear not in weakness to serve men, but in thy great Majesty, in
thy highest honor thou must now show forth plainly thy self in thy utmost and
most enlarged goodness, power and wisdom; Nothing now will serve thee but to
be all in all: To be all thou art in Heaven, in all the Earth, to bring forth
all thy riches to sill every creature, all glory in all things: Thou art all in
Earth as well as all in Heaven, all in King, in Parliament, in People, there is
nothing but thy self in these, thou art Bishops, Presbyters, Independents, all
these, and all in these; all Majesty, power, glory, justice, in the King* and
all the same in the Parliament, and all that too in the people* thou art all
the labor, strength, riches, freedom in the People, all this in the
Parliament, all the same in the King, all hight and all lowness: Thou art all
Wisdom, Authority, Government in Bishops; all care zeal, labor in Presbyters,
all love union, absoluteness in Independents: and all these in every one; thou
art the same in all all in all: All in darkness all in light, all in
weakness, all in strength: all that every part is all the whole is, all the
whole in every part: and all Heaven* all Glory, all peace, all quietness, all
love, all goodness in all these parts and whole: Less then this general and
near union and marriage will not satisfy thee; being thy self satisfied, thou
do satisfy all; and being pleased, thou please all: thy content, contents
every one, because thou art all: art content it self in all.

Thou have shaken all Nations, and the desire of all Nation is come: We have
been shaken into pieces, and every piece shaken out of all order and peace.
Thou art good that thou do but shake only; renders, that thou may make way
for thy self to enter and for all to enter with thee into every part. What we
desire, we have: we can desire nothing but the Lord, nothing is desirable but
the Lord; the Lord we have, and in the Lord we meet with every desirable thing
the desire satisfied, which is a tree of life. God was our desire, which is now
interpreted; being brought forth into performance and enjoyment: God the bottom
and top; the desire, and desired, meeeing in one spirit and Kingdom; God the
root in our desires, grown up into the fruit, attainment.

The interest of this whole Kingdom, in this restoration, is sathfied; and that
consists in; first, PEACE, a sure Peace, a wel-grounded Peace: here you have
the richest jewel of peace that heaven has; the Peace of God: The union and
agreement of Father, Son, and Spirit in one; this is our peace, and a
wel-grounded peace, settled and sure; that is lasting and durable; a threefold
cord that cannot be broken.

We are one with God, reconciled to Godf; we dwell together in the same house;
he has married us, one in God, one as God; one amongst our selves, as he is
one: All in the Father, the Head, the KING; all in the Son, the Body, the
Parliament: All in spirit in combination; acting and living together in their
just and lawful rights; and in perfect fruit of righteousness, love and peace.

Secondly, The Nation desires SETTLEMENT, after her shakings, here is everlasting
Settlement, upon sure foundations; The sure mercies of David; upon the rock of
ages: he who was, is, and ever will be: those pillars upon which England stood,
made clear, and bright; and the Kingdom settled upon them: Now the world is
established in eternity, so that it cannot be moved.

Thirdly, The HONOVROF THE NATION: honored indeed; For glory does dwell in our
Land; our Nation now is the very throne and seat of Divine glory, a Royal
Nation; filled with Princely spirits: the Kingdom it self raised from the grave
of lusts, luxury, covetuousnesse, oppression, baseness and beastliness, into
the nobleness and wisdom of the spirit of God: England first brought forth
into that excellent and perfect righteousness, liberty, and justice that shall
be a copy to other Nations; a Mother, that shall bring forth salvation to all
the earth.

Fourthly, The SETTLING OF RELIGION; of the true Orthodox, ancient Protestant
Religion; and the rooting out Sects, heresies, popery: This does it completely
and fully. We now shall have sound doctrine, measured by the scripture of truth,
the golden line of truth it self: truth derived from the bowels of eternity,
and constantly preserved and kept in the worst ages, free from defilement;
giving testimony of it self successively in the darkest times, and now breaking
forth in undeniable; and in disputable authority and evidence: Not pieces but a
whole body of Divinity; Divinity it self; not in shadow, but the body of it;
not maimed but entire and whole, from the highest head and glory of God, to the
lowest part of hell: and all the variety of estates, in Christ, in Angels, in
men; with their fallings and risings, descendings and ascendings, fully and
plainly brought forth. The Sun shall shine so clearly, as shall discipate these
mists of error that are amongst us; with such power as shall compose the
madness and disorder of peoples judgments, into a beautiful Uniformity; by
power of the Spirit of God, and in satisfaction to every mind.

Fifthly, Another public interest is, LIBERTY from all oppressing powers, this
we have here restored; a glorioue liberty, in which all Englishmen shall live
under Authority as children, not servants nor slaves; some shall rule as
Fathers, others shall obey as Sons: Nothing but love, goodness, and
gentleness in both; both to command and obey, shall be sweet and delightful:
no Laws but the perfect Law of liberty, which the subject shall choose and
desire. A KING free and enlarged into the hearts and estates of his people;
living in all they are and have, and they pleased to have it all the Kings;
every one hating that which will not be the KINGS, and Commonwealths; counting
that base and unworthy, that is not every ones as well as his own; and that
only to be rich, which is free for all: and so men free to part with, as well
as to enjoy; estates free as well as persons; and men not slaves to men, nor to
their wealth: no, not to propriety; which is the greatest bondage to serve
themselves, and their own wealth: That Is true wealth, Common wealth.

And the People free, living in the bosom of the King; in his authority and
greatness: they have a true right to it, as they have to any thing; The Court
is their Fathers house; the Thro^^ their own home; where every subject dwells,
and lives in the Kings honor and presence.

Sixthly, In this we have A right understanding between King and Parliament: The
wisdom of God to show us a way of peace; the true light shining from heaven
upon us: the night of our mistakes is past; The princes of darkness is thrown
down; and we are translated out of a kingdom of darkness, into the Kingdom of
God; in which we shall always have the true wisdom to guide us.

Seventhly, Here likewise have we AN ACT OF OBLIVION, whereby all
transgressions are blotted out; all carried into the depth of the Sea: where
sin, if it be sought for, it shall not be found: such a fullness of pleasure
and satisfaction, as will not admit a thought of revenge; if we shall remember
past things, it will be with joy and thanks to each other; for in hurting, we
have saved one another: wherein we have done evil to any, it is turned to
their good; The KING will thank the Parliament for rising against him; and the
Parliament thank the KING for leaving of them: There is GOD, and perfect good
in all that every party has suffered.

HAPPINESS it self; England now has a confluence of the riches of Heaven and
Earth in one blessedness: England; a glorious Land; the Land of God; abounding
in store, trade, justice, peace, amity. We are fallen,, but (as has been
expected) WE RISE AS ONE MAN: England acted by one head, one spirit, is become
one man: every one loving another as himself; and rising against the COMMON
ENEMY, the Devil, the Destroyer; who is, and has been our only enemy; we hate
none but him: and by this RISING, we free our selves from him.

As this satisfies the public, so every particular interest, or all interests
are here satisfied, and brought into one interest, which is the true nature of
an interest; to be in others a joint, or common subsistence: every part made
clean and right, and so interweaved into one entire garment; which is the
excellency of Divine works, they are large and save all; that is a humane and
devilish design, that saves one by the ruin of another; but that is Gods way
to save all so, as the salvation of one is the salvation of another: Now here
you see all contented.

The KING (as all have sworn and prayed) advanced into honor and greatness;
freed from prison, from chains of darkness wherein he has been held; brought
out of a low dungeon of wrath and heavy affliction, to the highest Throre of
Majesty: Person, and Office restored from blackness and foulness, to splendour
and brighenesse, into the Majesty of God; and that performed which the
Parliament often promised, A GLORIOUS KING; a KING in the glory of God; or the
glorious God; the Immortal KING Reigning in man, and over men: Sir, this is
your true Interest; its your life and soul; I know it is your heart, though yet
lying his: It Is the Key will unlock your spirit, and bring it cut into the light
and liberty of God; unlock your understanding, after seven times have passed
over you, you shall return to your Threne, and true Majesty shall be given to
you; and your Nobles and Kingdoms shall honor you; all shall freely bow to
you; and you shall command and Reign again, to the terror of your
adversaries, and joy of your friends: now the Prison doors stand open to you,
and you shall return to your Royal Parliament and City after seven years
banishment.

We have now a King in whom we can confide, as in God; now the LORD lives in
him, it is impiety and wickedness to have a thought of distrust concerning him;
the sure justice and righteousness of God in habits in the Throne, as its
propet place.

We have a King according to our own hearts; he lives in our hearts; arises out
of our hearts; and our hearts give him his dominion: he has all we have, and
has not too much, because he has us too; and nothing but what we freely give:
one higher by the head then all the People: having the wisdom of the whole in
him; of the largest understanding, and therefore King because he does in true
worth excel any in the Nation, and is of all men fittest to reign: fitted by
his great suffering, and Gods fullness dwelling in him.

This is the QVEENS interest she may return to the King, there is no fear now,
she cannot hurt either Parliament or Religion, both being in such a condition
as cannot be hurt: besides living in this light, of all she shall most love the
Parliament; It being the same with her self the Kings Consort, and she being
the same with it, concurting together in several ways to help, and honor the
King: if she should attempt any thing against it it would be against the King
and her self.

The Parliament administering about the affairs of the Kingdom, that the King
may enjoy his Queen and Family with greatest plenty, honor, ease and pleasure:
and the Queen administering in the domestical affairs of the King about his
Person, that the King may enjoy his Parliament and people in greatest content
and freedom: The Parliament in business of State, a Queen lying in the bosom
of the King; and the Queen in private and personal affairs a Parliament: and
so Parliament and Queen interested, joined in one interest; And for her
religion we are now so far from being afraid of it, that we rejoice in it, and
in her great interest in the Papacy: For as the Papists had by her designs
upon us: so now (the stream being turned) we shall by her design upon them, and
overrun the whole Papacy with light and truth, she shall be the door by
which we shall enter into all the riches and honors of the Papacy, and
without injury to them, we shall spoil them of all their glory, or rather
bring a glorious fire amongst them, that shall out shine theirs; and burn up
theirs into it self.

The Prince his Interest is here satisfied, he is indeed one with the
Parliament; they and he are brethren descended both from the loins of the King,
and are one in various forms: each being the glory of the King, ane the staff
of his age, Christened at the same Font the Spirit of Christ: both the hope and
joy of England, both being the glory of the King, propagated unto eternity, a
never failing off spring, and flourishing in the vigor and youthfulness of
the Son of God: both interested into Christ, or the interest of Christ, and so
of each other.

The Lords who have lost their Nobility, sunck in disgrace, scattered, and
almost buried in dishonor; by this shall be restored, not to airy empty
Titles, but to true Nobility: The Lord does appear Lord of Lords, your Lord,
owning Lordlinesse, and filling of it with himself, as well as King of Kings,
and as he sets a Crown of pure gold upon the head of the King: so Coronets of
pure gold upon yours, you shall shine as stars in this Firmament, in wisdom,
holiness, justice and goodness, and be in affinity to the King the head;
ennobled with heavenly Majesty, fit to be about the Throne, and advanced to be
the shoulders and breast of the Nation, next the head.

The Kings party are here fully satisfied: to see their King restored to the
honor and greatness of his Ancestors, his Progenitors: which is into the
glory of God the great King, the Kings true Father: They that contend for known
Laws, by this the Laws are known by God, brought out of the dust of the earth,
in which they were trampled upon, and restored into the brightness and life of
God: And now we shall see the whole body of the English Laws interpreted and
opened to us by the wisdom of God, and all drawn forth into life and power by
the spirit of God, as we see the fundamental Law of King and Parliament,
written in the face of God and Christ by the Spirit.

You shall have Religion in the old way, in the good old way, Divine service;
wherein every part of it shall be irradiated with the Beams of Divinity, and
in every thing you shall see the face of God, and have fellowship with the
Divine nature: Religion shall be adorned with solemnity, State, Pomp, Glory,
Ease, Music, all Heavenly and Earthly together, such as may allure and please
the minds of men, and there shall be nothing harsh or rude in it: yea,
rudeness it self shall have its comeliness. You shall have your sports,
pleasures, we will fing together in the hight of Zion: young men and maids
dannce together without offense or iniquity, all in the innocence, holiness
and joy of God: your whole life a course of pleasure; all things, yea labor and
pains shall be recreations: God recreating all things, or making all things
new, they shall be sweet and delightful: you shall have yout Holidays, yea,
your whole life shall be spent in Holy Days, a continual rest, the great
Jubilee.

You the more civil and solid of that party, that sinck into a retired
condition in these tempestious times, that lie quietly and patiently in your
graves of your own and the Kingdoms sufferings; your resurrection is come, and
you shall revive, and in a new spirit act for, and in the prosperity of the
Nation.

And you mad Lads shall swear: Now the Lord lives in truth, righteousness,
and judgment, and know him present with you; swear by the eternal God, the
spirit filling every Oath with truth: you shall curse your enemy the Devil
with all plagues to the pit of hell, and so dam him and ram him in, that he
shall no more come forth to trouble you: you shall eat and drink freely, and
forget your selves and your sorrow, and in it be filled with the spirit of the
Lord: be raised into high mirth and jollity, drink so freely of this new wine
of the Kingdom, till you are drunk out of your own wits into the Princely
spirit of God, and then ever speak and act things of love, worth, bravery, and
excellency: This is the KINGS HEALTH, his saving health, his union with God,
God with him, drink of this health freely: and the whole Kingdom shall PLEDGE;
be bound to fill it again, and drink down this heavenly liquor of the Majesty
of God in the King into them: and the whole people shall say, and see it
performed, GOD SAVE THE KING: The King is saved in God; and God the salvation
of the King.

This restoration fully satisfies the Parliaments Interest, gives her higher
Privileges: She is called to an honorable state to live in the Lord Christ,
to sit with Christ in heavenly places, to be one with the Son, the body of God:
to be Jer^salem above the mother of us all; and therefore f^ee, free with God,
and in God with the King: freedom to enter into his heart and bosom, to lie
there continually: The King shall greatly desire they beauty; Thou now have
power as well as liberty, to make righteous Laws in perfect Righteousness that
shall stand for ever: such a King and such a Parliament as we have long begged
to agree together in just things: and in both we shall reap the fruit of our
prayers: which though they were sowed in weakness, and now seem dead and
rotting in the earth, yet shall rise in power.

FINIS.
