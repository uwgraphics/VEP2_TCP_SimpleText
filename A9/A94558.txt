TO THE LORDS AND COMMONS, CONTINUING AT WEST MINSTER,
The humble Petition of the Scholars Of the several Gramer-Schooles, in and
about the City of LONDON.
Shows,
THat your pretty Petitioners having heard of your admirable Vigilence and
Policy, in granting free leave to the Apprentices of this City for the
Public Good to run from their Masters, and to serve their time out under
his Excellency, with whom they may have the honor to live and die; and that
for the satisfaction of their friends, who foolishly expect that their said
Children should be taught their Trades, whereby they might be hereafter enabled
to live honestly in their several Vocations; Your wonderful Justice and Power
has ordained, that they shall loose no time in the expedition they have now
undertaken, but that when his Excellency and the Public good shall be able to
defend one another, all evil Conncellours and the Malignant Party be devoured
and eaten up, and his Majesty gotten into honest hands again; that the said
Apprentises shall (if they please) return to their several shops, and be made
Fore-men and Freemen, as if their Aprons had never been left off, with other
notable privileges against their Masters and with their Mistresses, which your
grave wisdoms for the encouragement of well affected persons have provided for
them.

Your Petitioners fall upon their knees before your Almightinesse, and desire
that in this year of Jubilee, when all manner of People are suffered to do what
they please, and no Rules, Laws, or Orders left to compel the Freeborn
Nation; they may not be left the only Subjects of this Kingdom, but may be
also at liberty to exercise their conscience, and suffered to do their weak
endeavors against their Sovereign for his good, under the command of his
Excellency; not doubting but that they shall so learn the use of their Arms
too, that they may be able to kill any man within two foot of the Kings Majesty
and never endanger him, against whom they desire not to be thought to bear the
least ill will in the world. And that you will Declare and Vote, that after the
short business in hand shall be performed; your hopeful Petitioners shall be
as good Scholars, as if they had continued at School, or in the University,
and have the same Privileges and Abilities to Preach and Teach, as those
simple lazy people, who neglecting to join with you in making these present
distractions, make no advantage of the wonderful things you have done, but in
contempt of your Authority, live as if there were no Parliament,

Printed in the year 1642.
