Anglo-Tyrannus, Or the Idea of a NORMAN MONARCH, Represented in the parallel
Reigns of HENRY the Third and CHARLES Kings of ENGLAND, Wherein the whole
management of affairs under the Norman Kings is manifested, together with the
real ground, and rise of all those former, and these latter contestations
between the Princes, and people of this Nation, upon the score of Prerogative
and Liberty. And the impious, abusive, and delusive practices are in short
discovered, by which the English have been bobbed of their freedom, and the
Norman Tyranny founded and continued over them.

Nihil medium Libertas habet, quae aut tota est, quod debet, aut amissa part
sui tota fuit, et extinguitur: Quam ideirco non ignavis, neque Brutis, and ad
serviendum natis, sed erectis animabus Deus immortalis conservandam tradit.

To the Right Honorable the Lord President BRADSHAW.
My Lord,
THough I may seem bold, I am not so blind, but that I perceive your Lordship
taller by the head than most I can set by you, and so come for patronage in
hopes of a favorable smile, being sure to have frowns enough from them, who
not able to look over the heads of others, crowd as it were hood-winked after
those that go before them. It was the ancient practice of enslaved Rome, after
death to Deifie her Tyrants, and this her badge of slavery we in England have
long worn as a Livery of our bondage; whose Kings (when dead) must be of
Famous, and Blessed Memory, though they lived most infamous for Cowardice, and
detestable for Tyranny; and though this was acted to flatter their Successors
at first, yet by custom it has so prevailed, that notwithstanding the cause
is now taken away, the effect remains among the multitude (to whom Logic must
give place in their irrational actings) and from a natural necessity is
become a divine institution; so that immortal, as earthly Crowns are givem
them Iure Divino, to dye Saints, as they live Kings: Indeed Rome may have
something pleaded in her excuse, for she had her infernal Gods, whom by
sacrifice she endeavored to appease from doing mischief, so little inferior
was her superstition to her slavery, which was as great as tyranny could
create. I know our royal Idolaters will lay hold of the Horns of this, De
mortuis nil nisi bonum; but it can afford them little safety, and me less
danger, whom the Metaphysics have taught, that bonum and verum convertuntur,
that J cannot write good, unless J write truth; thus what they have taken for
their shield, is the dart which pierces their Liver, and by what they would
ward off, they are smitten with the blow of high treason, themselves being the
only and grand transgressors against the majesty of History, whose Prerogative
it is not only to reward the good, with honor and renown, but also to punish
the evil, with ignominy and reproach. The case standing thus, I am assured of
your Lordships protection, against all storms such enchantments may raise
against me, whose rational eye being able to pierce these foggs does perceive
what has so long been invelop'd in the mist.

Thus my Lord, having looked aside at self, yet I constantly kept your
Lordship in my eye,, and your honor stood fore-right, my safety but on one
side in my choice, not out of presumption that my weak endeavors could add
any thing to you, but in assurance that others seeing what profit they have
received, what misery they have escaped in the book, will return to the
Dedication, and with honor read your name, who have been so great an iustrumet
under God of their deliverance.

God has chosen you to judge between a King and a people, and your sentence
has shown you are sufficiently informed of what this Discourse treats: yet as
a Pharos may be useful to delight a man with the prospect of those rocks,
shelves, and sands he has escaped, to whom it was a sea mark to guide safe
into the Port; so may your Lordship with comfort cast your eye upon the ensuing
Discourse, viewing the dangers you and all good Patriots have past, especially
having had so great an hand in the steerage into the Harbor.

And now give me leave to mention your worthy acts, that it may be known I am
not unmindfull of a good turn, it is the only thanks I am able to repay in the
behalf of my Conntrey and self: I know some will be apt to condemn such an
action as savouring of flattery, but the most free from that vice, the most
severe, the most rigid in the School of virtue, a Cato himself has done the
like, and that not only upon the Score of gratitude, but to encourage and
incite to further gallantry, and the most censorious of them may perchance
perceive their own black Shadows by your light, and from your example take out
a new lesson of duty to their country whom they ought to serve before
themselves.

You have undauntedly stood the shock of what ever slavish malice could bring
against you, and have been eminent in vindicating the right God and nature
invested the nation with from the power of usurping tyranny, no counterfeit
rays, no glittering impostures gilded with pretenses of sacred, and Majestic
have dazzeled your eyes, but with a steady and impartial hand you have guided
the Scale of justice, wherein that bubble of worldly honor has been found too
light to counterpoise those sins of murder and oppression, which brought such
heavy judgments on the land, whose yo^e has been broken, whose guilt has
been removed in a great measure, by having justice executed without respect of
persons.

(...) says the Philosopher, to do good to one is honorable, to a nation is
heroical; to perform the first, is the private man's duty, to be able to do the
latter is the public magistrates divinity. God has not only given you power,
but a mind also to employ it well, you have been good as well as Great, and God
has preserved you, and honored you in your integrity, of which we have
received such sure signs, that it must argue us more severe than just, more
suspicious than Charitable, but to doubt that the Honor of God, the good and
freedom of your Country shall not still possess the first part of your
affections, and be the ultimate end in all your actions, that so the goodwill
of him that dwelt in the Bush being with you and your fellow Builders may
enable you to perfect the great work of Reformation to his glory, your own
honors, and the happiness and freedom of this nation, all which are
uufeignedly desired by him who craving pardon for this bold approach as by duty
obliged subscribes.

My Lord Your Lordships most humble servant George Walker.

To the Reader.
HE must rise betimes (says the proverb) who will please all, which may cease
our wonder that the Commonwealth is so displeasant to some, which has gotten
up so late, yet better late than never. But though some dotarts square all by
antiquity, supposing none so wise, which are not so old* and guess at the
understanding by the gray hairs, which in truth are rather a badge of
imperfection, and the declension of nature, and which came into the world at
the back door, being a part of that fatal offspring begot between the
Serpents craft, and our first Parents disobedience: I speak not this in scorn
of age, which I honor when found in the way of righteousness and truth, nor
in denial of its advantage over youth by experience, but to oppose that error
spread amongst many that all wisdom deceased with their Grandsires, and they
are only to travel in their tracks, an opinion more agreeable to a pack
horse, than a man endued with a rational soul, which is not to lie idle, and
which indeed the word of God, and universal experience which even make fools
wise contradicts, the one infallibly declaring that in the latter days the
Spirit of Truth shall more abundantly be poured forth into earthen vessels; the
other visibly informing us of the daily advantages we have above our ancestors
to attain Knowledge; for admit they were such G^y ants in understanding, yet we
poor dwarfes being upon their shoulders may see further than they: but I say
though some do thus, yet the sons of reason measure by another standard* as
knowing that if worth should be prised by antiquity, the rotten would become of
more value than the ripe, to such therefore do I present this Discourse, who
judge by reason, not passion, which so often makes the Crow seem white, the
Bells to tink as the fools do think: and in confidence Reader that thy
ingenuity is such that no byas of interest will wheel thee narrow, and thy
capacity able to draw thee from running wide of reason, the only mark men in
civil games should bowl at, I have taken the pains to present thee with a map
of Englands condition under her Monarchs, wherein thou may view how justly
Magna Charta is cast in our Governors teeths to beget a belief of their being
more tyrannous than our Kings were: admit it be not observed in every tittle
now, what are we the worse, when some fresher and more apposite remedy is
applied to heal us? let us consider that it was constituted under another
Government, and so cannot square to the present, and that the makers of it were
but men, nay and such as had not that room to act in as we have, and so could
not foresee or at best provide for all that now providence has wrought amongst
us: but I shall not detain thee with a long Preface from the Book, wherein an
ingenuous and rational spirit will discern, that if our present Governors had
been bound up to former rules, we could never have attained that estate which
now by Gods mercy and their prudence we enjoy, and may so still if our own
perverseness hinder us not. Truly that Fahle in Pliny of certain monstrous
people in Africa which had one foot, and that so big, that they covered and
shaded with it their whole body, may be a perfect emblem of our Kingly
Government, which being at first instituted for a firm basis and prop to the
body politic, what by the fatal sloth and stupidity of the people, and the
industrious craft, and activity of Monarchs was turned topsie turvie, and had
got so between heaven and us, that it wholly deprived us of that free light and
happiness which God and nature held forth unto us; and thus in stead of a
support was become a burden under the weight of which the whole groaned, nay
was almost pressed to death; but thou being a member and sound, can not but
be as sensible of this as I, and for dead slesh and rotten limbs, corrosives,
and cuttings are only proper, it will be weakness in me therefore to doubt of
the plaudit to the Common wealth, so farewell till we meet in the book.

Anglo-Tyrannus, Or the Idea of a Norman MONARCH etc.
Fatal and Bloody have Crowns, and Scepters been in general to all Nations,
in particular to this in England, and that not only in regard of the strife
between competitours, who in pnrple gore deeply dyed their regal roabs, and by
the slaughtered carcasses of their Rivals, and partakers, ascended the
Imperial throne, but in respect of the iterated contests between Prerogative,
and Liberty, the Kings aiming at uncontrolable absolutenes, the people claming
their Native Freedom.

The verity of this assertion we may see deeply imprinted in bloody Characters,
throughout the whole series of English history, yea so deeply, that it may even
create an envy in us of the Turkish happiness, and beget a wish after their
bondage, who though they go for absolute slaves, yet cannot show such dire
effects of tyranny, as we and our ancestors have felt and groaned under.

That policy of State (impious and inhumane enough) of destroying the younger
Brothers of the Ottoman line, though decried by us and all who write
Christians, yet compared with our Monarchs politic arts and actings, may seem
to have been founded on the advice of their own, and mankinds better genius to
prevent the efusion of blood, and deliver millions from the shambles; there a
few males of his own Family fall a victime to their Tyrant, when whole
Hecatombs can scarce appease the thirsty ambition of an English pretender; there
one house suffers, here none escapes, as but to instance in oue contest between
Henry the sixth and Edward the fourth, wherein was fought ten bloody battles,
besides all lesser scirmishes, thousands of Lords, Gentlemen, and Commons
slain, and one half of the Nation destroyed, to set up a King to trample upon
the other; for in that quarrel between the Houses of Lancaster and York fell
80998. persons, 2. Kings, 1. Prince, 10. Dukes, 2. Marquesses, 21. Earls, 2.
Viscounts; 27. Lords, 1. Prior, 1. Judge, 1* 39. Knights, 441. Esquiers: this
has been the happiness and peace which a successive, and hereditary Monarchy
has afforded England.

For our liberty, we can indeed show many of our Kings large, and good deeds,
but few or none of their actions, their hands always having been too hard for
their Seals, Parchments, and Charters we purchased of them with the price of
Millions, both in Blood, and Treasure, but let us but pass by their promises,
and view their performances, and we may set aside Turkey, and term England the
slave: and this appears in our Chronicles, where though in the Theorie and
System the English Government has been limited, and bounded by good, and
distinguishing laws, yet in the exercise and practic part of every Kings
reign, we shall find it deserve as bad a name as others, who are called most
absolute. The Poets fable of Tantalus has been verified in us, who though we
have been set up to the chinne in freedom, and have had liberty bobbing at our
lips, yet never could we get a drop to squench our thirsts, or a snap to stay
our stomachs, this being added to our sufferings, to want in the midst of
seeming abundance, and as the vulgar have it, to starve in a Cooks shop, a
trick those Lords we term absolute were never ingenuous enough to torment their
slaves with.

Were there then no more but this, we might well command those Roman and
Turkish Tyrants with a Cede Majoribus, to give place to ours: How much of a
punie did thy wish savor dull Caligula, that all Rome had but one neck that
thou might smite it off at a blow? How short of art does thy rage fall
unskillfull Sultan with a Bowstring or Scymiter to snach life from an offending
slave? Behold, and blush you who wear the title of Master Tyrants, at the
Norman exactness, which has thought it beneath a Princes anger to give sudden
death a quick riddance, and not worth the name of slavery unless he can make
his vassals feel the lingering effects of his Tyranny: it was not enough for us
to be slaves unless we knew it, lest otherwise not desiring freedom, we should
not have been so sensible of their power; we must with Erasmus be hung between
Heaven, and Hell, that we might see our loss as well as feel it; but yet this
was not enough, something must be added to make their Tyranny most exquisite,
for we could not enjoy this condition unless we paid soundly for it; how many
Battles have been fought for a piece of Parchment to instruct us but with our
miseries? and how many millions granted to our Kings but to play the
Hocus-pocusses and cheat us to our faces.

Happy and thrice happy may England call the condition of Turk, Russe, or
Moor, who depending only upon their Tyrants wills, know no Law but their
Commands, a head now and then paies the shot there, when two and twenty of the
chiefest Lords heads must off at once here, besides thousands of Gentlemen and
Commons butchered, for but acting according to those Laws which their King and
his predecessors had an hundred times sworn to grant, and maintain inviolable;
as but to instance in the Reign of Edw. 2. omitting the innumerable carcasses
of Englands noblest Sons, which have bin so often forced to rampire in
parchment liberty from the fury of other Tyrant, and as their last wills to
deliver a few written Charters to their sons, who were also to fight, and pay
for them as they did, and be as much the better then too as they were: For to
sum up all, these our so dear liberties were of no other use than to drein our
purses as well as veins, that when Englands generous blood seemed increased too
to tamely suffer Norman Lords to trample on her upon this pretense it might be
let out; or when her Kings wanted money, they might by these lures draw
subsidies to their fists, and so hang them by till the next occasion; but I
humbly conceive that if our Ancestors had taken that course a Natural once
did, when he was chosen to judge between a Cook, and a Countryman, and as their
Kings fed them with a sight of Liberty, supplied them again with chinking of
money, and have executed justice without respect of persons, they had in all
probability diverted those plagues, which the crying sins of oppression and
murder have brought down from Heaven upon this Nation. But let us descend from
Generals, and view but the Reign of Henry the third, the very Idea of Tyranny,
and exact copy after which all other Kings have writ, especially the last, and
we shall not only behold the map of our Ancestors misery, and folly, but also
perceive our own happiness, and Gods mercy in not suffering us to be deluded
and baffeled as they were.

In the midst of the civil flames kindled between Tyranny and liberty, King
John expiring, his son Henry the third, a child of nine years of age, by the
power of William Marshall Earl of Pembrook, and the consent of most of the
Barons, ascends the Throne: and here we may observe the unadvised lenity of
the English Lords, who not considering what was bred in the bone would not
easily out in the flesh, so easily accepted of the Son, though the Father had
played the Tyrant, and Traitor to the height, giving the Crown to the Pope (he
would be a slave himself rather than they should not) trampling upon the
people, yea detesting the whole Nation, as his grief because Corn was so cheap
when he thought he had wasted al may make out: But Gods time was not come, and
he was pleased to set their example to guide posterity from splitting on that
Rock, I mean such of them who when they have eyes will make use of them.

But to say the truth they were Lords, whom Kings knew so well to cajole, or at
worst set so together by the ears, that they could command them into their
traps at list; let but one have that Earldome, the other this Lordship, and
their turns were served, others may shift for themselves if they can; besides
it was none of their interest to stub up Tyranny by the roots, for then down
had gone their branches too; for they knew that when that tree was feld, the
Rooks nest, must to ground with it; but we may be silent in this and give
experience leave to speak for us.

And yet let us but look a litttle further than the gilded, and embroydered
superficies, and we shall perceive that these Lordlings estate was but even by
so much more free, and happy than the Commons, by how much that King of
Cypresses condition was bettered, when his Iron shackles and chains were
converted into silver fetters: they enjoyed a little more gaudie servitude, and
to speak to the capacity of our Countryman were as the Fore-horses in the
teame, which though they wear, the Feather, and have the Bells about their
ears, yet must draw themselves as well as those that follow; nay and if they
did seem unwilling to lead, they were sure to be lashed by the Royal Carters
till the blood came, and have their gay trappings to boot pulled over their
ears: and this the wise and generous of them knew, and often endeavored to
remedy, but were still prevented by the envy and jealousy one of another,
which was created and cast in among them by their Kings, as partly will appear
in the following story.

Henry being thus Crowned at Gloucester, and many great Barons daily resorting
to his party (moved both by the proud carriage of the Frenchmen, and the
confession of the Viscount Melun, That Lewis had taken an Oath, and all his
Lords, to destroy the English Nobility) raises a great Army, defeateth at
Lincoln his enemies, and forces Lewis to condescend to an accord, depart the
Land, and abjure his claim to the Crown, which for two years he had worn over
the greatest part of the Land: for John by his tyranny so galled the Peoples
necks, that for ease they were forced to get a new yoke, and elect Lewis, the
French Kings son, to defend them against his cruelty, such effects wrought
the violence of an unruly King, and the desperation of an oppressed people.

3. Year
The agreement on Henrys part was to restore to the Barons, and people all
rights and heritages, with the Liberties for which the discord arose between
John, and them, to pardon all that had aided Lewis, and set free all Prisoners
of War, and to do this he takes his Oath, or for him the Popes Legate, and
Protector.

The Protector dies, 4. Year.
a man of great wisdom and valor, and who had managed affairs to the great
settlement of the State: and the King is again Crowned, and Escuage of 2.
marks a Knights Fee granted him in Parliament he promising to confirm their
Liberties when he came of age.

8. Year.
Henry having gotten some of his Fathers old Counselors about him, begins to
play Rex, and obtains a Bull from the Pope, whereby he was adjudged of age
sufficient to receive the Government into his own hands (the power of making
and altering times and seasons it seems being then in the Romish Prelates Power)
and now since He would be of age, in the Parliament at Westminster, the
Archbish. of Canterbury and the Lords desire him to confirm according to
Covenant their promised Liberties. This was impiously oppugned by some (as
Princes shall ever find mouths to express their pleasures) of his Ministers,
who urged it to have been an act of Constraint; yet at last it was promised to
be ratified by the King, and so by that usual shift of prolongation was put off
for that time, to the greater vexation of that following; for this all his
Reign caused the imbroylments, rendered Him odious to the people, and made him
a far less King by striving to be more than he was, a just reward of
violations.

But this pause turned the blood, and showed how sensible the State was, in the
least stoppage of that tender vein: For the Lords began to assemble at
Leicester, but the Archbish of Canterbury (whom the King by fair words soothed
into a fools paradise) by menacing excommunication brought them in; the King
also to be even with them, demands a restoration of all those things they had
received from his Ancestors, and to terrify them for the future, falls upon
the chief sticklers, taking diverse Lordships from them, thus were they forced
to sit down with loss of both Lands and Liberties, and such of them whose
spirits could not brook the sight of the Coutt abusive proceedings secretly to
jogge away into the Country.

The Royal gamster having dealt so well for himself, yet on the sudden is put
to his trumps, yea forced to shuffle, and cut too; Money is wanting to maintain
his Wars in France, and this his ranting Counselors cannot help him too; they
who were so high in the last Parliament, are fain now to lower their sails, the
Lions hide must be patched up with the Foxes skin, he must promise and do any
thing for present cash: A Parliament therefore is summoned to Westminster, and
of them a relief demanded, but no penny, IX* Year,
without a Pater noster, no money unless their Liberties be confirmed; and now
necessity which makes the Old Wife trot, persuades Henry to be so gracious to
himself as to comply with them. Thus Magna Charta and Charta de Firesta were
confirmed, which though purchased before, and then entered upon and possessed by
the people, yet have been paid for to some purpose if we consider the sums
given since, and to little or none if we sum but up the profit our Landlords
let us reap by them. Thus the Petition of Right and other later acts were
obtained by us, which being acts of grace were to cease when our King pleased
to turn graceless, which he never did, nor intended to do until the first
oppertunity, wherein a small rub called impossibility might be removed out of
his way.

These Laws thus obtained; down go the forests, and men repossess their
habitations, which the Norman Lords had outed them of and bestowed upon Wild
Beasts, yet more inoffensive than themselves, for if Cato have any credit, we
must believe Kings to be de genere Bestiarum rapacium, no better nor worse than
ravenous beasts, and indeed that undeniable Author Doctor Experience has by
arguments not to be disputed against confirmed that wise Romans assertion,
indeed the last of Romans who abhorred to outlive the freedom, and honor of
his Country.

And now if we will believe one Writer, the very Dogs rejoiced, being freed
from the customary danger of losing their claws; but though the Gentleman is
so sanguine now, yet he afterward becomes as choleric, and from playing with,
turns to play the very Curre, barking and snarling at all those Lords which
stood for these Laws: O the ridiculous power of slavish flattery, working more
than a brutish change in low Souls, making a man out of his own mouth judge
himfelf less deserving of Liberty because less sensible of it than a Dog
that will fawn and wag his tail at him who unchains him, whilst he crouches,
and licks his fingers who enslaves and fetters him. But take one observation
along: That as the Norman Conqueror first appropriated all old Forests, and
dispeopled places to make new ones, and still when any parcel of Liberty was
regained, those Forest Tyrannies were diminished; so now when that Norman yoke
is thrown off our necks, Forests and Parks are broken open with it; a certain
sign that tyranny is expired now that its pulse is ceased in the main Artery.
Thus the Historian reports the Grove of Bays dyed, which was planted by
Augustus, when Nero was executed, in whom ceased that proud, and bloody Family.

Another Parliament is called, wherein nothing was done by reason of the Kings
sickness, 10. Year.
but only the Legates unreasonable demands denied, the Pope being become more
than quartermaster in England, by the Kings good Fathers means; in this year
also the Londoners were fined 5000 marks, and the Burgesses of Northampton 1200
pounds (for their former aiding Lewis) contrary to the Oath and Pardon passed
at the agreement, as the Prelates were before, who were made to pay such large
sums that the Legate got 12000 marks for his share.

A Parliament is summoned at Oxford, where the King declaring himself to be of
lawful age, 11. Year
assumes the power of Government to himself; this he had done before by the
Popes Bull, but it was requisite for his design to grow child again, and the
Pope was contented to have his Bull turn Calf to help his Son, whom he knew
might make him amends; and now to show what metal he was made on, he cancels
and disanuls the Charters as granted in his nonage, and so of no validity.
Here we may behold the wretchless impudence of these Royal Creatures, he that
had before in the eighth year of his Reign, made himself of age for his own
ends, yet now is not ashamed upon the same score to pretend nonage in the ninth
year, wherein he confirmed both the Charters: Thus if the King say 8. is more
than 9. the people must believe it, for it is treason no doubt to question
their Sovereigns words or actions, and Rebellion to chop Logic with him,

And now this cancelling having annulled all hopes of a subsidy, He has a new
shift to drain the peoples purses, by making a new Seal, and forcing all which
held any thing by the old to renew their Patents, fining at the pleasure of the
Chief Iusticiarie, not according to their ability; It seems the Old Seal was
under age too, and for this he had a Bull, but whether from the Pope, or
somebody else, is the question.

These perfidious and oppressive courses so incense the people, that the Lords
appoint a Randezvouz at Stamford, intending it seems to bait these Bulls, and by
force to keep them from goring. The King is startled at this news, hearing his
Brother the Earl of Cornwall was also joined to them, and by fear brought to
promise a redress, and so pacifies them at Northampton, and buys his brother
to side with him, with his mothers Dower, and all the Lands in England
belonging to the Earl of Britain, and late Earl of Bullogne. These are the
uneven paths which necessity forces Tyrants to stagger through, scraching up
here, and leaving a piece there, using the Rake with this hand, and the Fork
with that; Peter must be robbed to pay Paul; these pilled and polled, to bribe
the other: but these shifts will be quickly thredbare, by which, what is got in
the Hundred is lost in the Shire.

The King having bound himself, by his Procurators at Rome* 13. Year.
to the payment of Tenths, it seems the Pope would not do a job of journeywork
for nothing, calls a Parliament that the Legate might demand them; but though the
Legate was impudent enough to ask the question, yet the Laity were so modest as
to deny him; the Clergy being over-reachd by Segrave one of the Kings Counsel
consented, and found a very hard bargain of it; for the ravenons Legate exacted
them at a set day, and those that missed it, were sure to be hit home with an
Excommunication. Thus between the Lion and the Wolf, the Flock went to wrack;
for no doubt but the King had a feeling in the cause, or his Counsel would
never have been so diligent in the business; 14. Year.
but all this would not do, he therefore exacts great sums of the Clergy
(whom the Pope could rule and would, it being his turn now) and the City of
London for redemption of their liberties, (an excellent way to make them free,
for they seldom are so of themselves, yet have they given down largely in this
Cause, to their Honor be it spoken, and may they be so moderate as not to kick
over the palle in the upshot) and forces the Jews to pay the third of all their
movables to maintain his Wars he then began in France, whither he goes,
leaving them to pray, that he might deal more Christianly with them for the
future.

But his evil gotten goods thrived not, and the King, besides an infinite
expense of treasure, having lost diverse Nobles and valiant men, without any
glory returns home, bringing with him the Earl of Britaigne, and many
Poictovins, to suck up what could further be wrung from the poor people of
England: and in order to this calls a Parliament, 15. Year.
wherein upon pretense and promise of sending supplies into Spain against the
Saracens, he obtains a fifteenth of the Laity, and Clergy; but the Popes turn
it seems was come, who falls a cursing all that had any hand in withholding
Tithes from those multitudes of strangers which he had preferred to benefices,
and the King makes a strict inquisition after them, and forces them all to
run to Rome for absolution of this horrible sin of resisting his Pastors in
the main work of their Ministry, few of them having more English than would
serve to demand their tithes but it was enough with the Pope they had that,
whose special care was to see the Flock might be fleeced, for teaching, that
might have spoiled devotion to Rome, which ignorance is the furest Nurse too: a
strange way to Heaven that the blindest hit best. Christ's servants are the
Children of Light; Sure then his Holiness must be Vicar to the Prince of
Darkness, whose best Subjects see least.

A Parliament also is called at Westminster, 16. Year.
which expecting deeds from him, before they would do any thing, and he not
being poor enough, nor so shiftlesse as to fall to mending so soon, breaks up
with a flat denial of any money: Hereupon by the advice of the Bishop of
Winchester, since the Parliament was so dry, he falls to squeeze his own
Spunges, and amongst the rest his darling Hubert de Burgh Earl of Kent, and his
Chief Iusticiarie feels the weight of Kingly kindness, which loves a man so
long as he is useful; but if any advantage shall accrue, it is very Rebellion
should affection be so saucy as to plead privilege against Royal profit, and
naw kenning of Kingcraft, for Kings to be more nice than wise. O the wretched
estate of that man, who to curry favor with a Tyrant, cares not how he acts,
nor what he does! aside he is thrown so soon as his great Master has served
his turn on him, and being down is sure to be trampled on to some purpose by
the enraged people, who in the servants misery seek a recompense for the
Masters tyranny; and this has been told us by a King and Prophet long ago, Put
not your trust in Princes, men of high degree area lie. And now the Bishop of
Winchester is the Court Minion, but as he tript up the Earl of Kents heels; so
will he be laid on his back shortly, and the same noose he made for others,
will catch the Woodcock himself ere long; who was returned from the Holy Wars
abroad, to begin it seems wicked discord at Home: for he showing the king, that
Foraigners were the only journey-men to drive on his trade of Tyranny, and
fittest instruments to keep the English in slavery, causes him, who for his own
ends cared neither whom nor what he made use of, to displace all the chief
Counselors, and Barons of the kingdom, and to bestow all places of
concernment, either Military or Civil, on strangers.

These strains of so strange and insufferable violences so exasperate the
Nobility, that many combine for defense of the public, and the Earl of
Pembroke in all their names tells the King how pernicious and dangerous these
courses would prove, whom the Bishop of Winchester insolently answers, That it
was lawful for the K. to call what strangers he would to defend his Crown, and
compel his proud and rebellious Subjects to their due obedience, that is, tame
slavery; The Lords netled with this Prelates peremptorinesse, which the King
bore him out in, depart with more indignation, vowing to spend their Lives in
this cause concerning their liberties so much, hereupon the K. sends for whole
Legions of Poictovins, and then summons them to appear in the Parl. called on
purpose to entrap them, but they were so wise as to avoid the snare, and so
resolute as to send him word, That unles he would mend his manners, by the
common Counsel of the kingdom, they would expel both him and his evil
Counselors the Land; But all this avayled them not, for upon their refusal to
repair to him at Gloucester, the King without the judgment of his Court, or
their Peers, causes them to be proclaimed Outlaws, seizes upon all their Lands,
which he divides among his Poictovins (the Panisaries that guarded and
boulstered out this Grand Sultan and his Vizier Basha Winchester in their
tyrannies) and directs out Writs to attach their Body.

But now give me leave a little to digress, and show how our bloud-hounds have
run counter on the same foil, have acted the most of this scene in our days.
For thus, though our King wanted not so great a stock of strangers to set up
with, there being so many base spirited Englishmen, which would be
isntrumental in enslaving their Country, a thing our noble and generous
Ancestors abhorred to do; yet German horse were to have bin brought over to
help to improve the Trade, and lie for factourage of Tyranny in every County.
Thus the Earl of Straffora tells the King he had an Army in Ireland, which might
be brought over to bring England under the yoke, a Counsel which cost the Giver
his Head; Thus were Swedes, Danes, French, Scots, Irish, and Dutch sent for
over, and invited by the King to help him. Thus the Members were illegally
proceeded against, the Lords summoned to York, and the Parliament commanded to
Oxford, and all that refused handled without mittens, their Estates being
conferred on those who would engage for Tyranny, and themselves proclaimed
Traitors and Rebels, indeed these things considered, it was no marvel God was
so often called to witness, that Tyranny was not intended, and impiety used to
create credulity, God mocked that men might be abused, since no reason could be
given to gain our belief, and make us give our own eyes the lie.

The Lords though much weakened by the revolt of some of themselves (the King
having won the Earl of Cornwall, and Winchester with a thousand marks bought
the Earls of Chester, and Lincoln to his party) repair into Wales, at that time
very sensible of their oppression and the Earl of Kent, to cry quittance with
the K. and make amends for his former faults, breaks prison and joins with
them: hereupon the K. in person marches against them, but he is beaten, and
forced to retreat with dishonor to Gloucester, his Foraigners also being again
sent against them run the same chance, their General and thousands of them
being slain on the place, being frustrated therefore in his design of force,
the King employes a Friar to cajole the Earl of Pembroke, General of the Forces
raised by the Barons, but all the flatteries, promises, and threats of that
crafty instrument, could not shake the constancy of that Noble Lord, who
gallantly told him, That he feared no danger, nor would ever yield to the Kings
will, which was guided by no reason; that he should give an evil example to
relinquish the justice of his Cause, to obey that will which wrought all
injustire, whereby it might appear he loved worldly possessions, more than
Right and Honor. Thus the promise of restoration of his former estate, with
the addition of great Lands in Herefordshire, nothing prevailed with him, in
whose heroik Mind Honor and his Conntryes good were Commanders in chief.

No way therefore now being left but that, the King tryes what may be done by
Treachery, and takes a truce with them: in the mean while seizing all those
great possessions which were left the Earl in Ireland, by his famous Ancestor
the Earl Strongbow, that thereby he might draw the Earl over thither; this
design takes effect, and the Earl endeavoring to regain his livelihood lost
his life circumvented by treachery. Thus noblest souls are soonest intrapt, who
measuring others their own thoughts are the least suspicious; but his death
wrought such effects as caused the King to disown the business, and lay the
load upon his Counselors shoulders.

19 Year
In a Parl. at Westminst. the King being plainly told his own the Bishops
threatening to proceed by Ecclesiastical censure both against him, and his
Counselors, and seeing no way to subsist and get his ends but by temporizing,
consents to them, calls home the Lords, removes the strangers, and brings his
new officers to account; now the storm falls so violently, that Winchester with
his Bastard are forced for shelter to take Sanctuary, until by large Fines the
King was appeased, who to get money was very ready to do any thing.

20. Year.
Escuage is granted toward the marriage of his Sister, whom he bestowed on the
Emperor with 30000 marks for a Dowry, besides an Imperial Crown, and other
Ornaments to a great value.

21. Year.
The King marries Elianor, Daughter to the Earl of Provence; a match which
beside the distance of the place, was infinitely disadvantagious, having no
Dowry, getting a poor kindred, which must needs draw means from this kingdom.

A Parliament also is assembled at London, (which the King would have held in
the Tower, but that the Lords refused to come) in which Sheriffs were removed
for corruption, and the new ones sworn to take no bribes: Now the King
endeavors to change his officers, and to take the Seal from the Chancellor,
the Bishop of Chichester; who refuses to deliver it which he had by the Common
Council of the kingdom, without assent of the same, and having carried himself
unblamably in his office is much favored by the people. Also he receives some
old cast officers into favor, such was his levity and irresolution, moved with
any Engine to do and undo, and all out of time and order, wherein he ever
loses ground; and goes about by the Popes Authority to revoke his former
Grants, which adds to the already conceived displeasure of the people.

22. Year.
In another Parliament, or the same adjourned, the King demands relief, and upon
promise to confirm the Charters, and not seek to infringe them upon any
pretense, as want of the Popes confirmation, etc. a thirtieth part of all
movables is granted yet upon condition that it should be gathered by four
Knights in every shire, and laid up in Abbeys or Castles, that if the King
performed not his promise, it might be returned, that he should leave the
Counsel of Aliens and use only that of his Natural Subjects. Which being
done, and to make show on his part, some old Counselors suddenly removed, and
others chosen, which were sworn to give him good and faithful advice (yet I
hope he had a Negative voice, and might choose whither he would hearken unto
them and be no King or no?) the Parliament concluded, and with it ended all his
goodly Promises.

For he presently hastens to Dover, receiving a Legate without acquainting the
Lords with the cause of his coming, exacts the Subsidy contrary to order, is
wholly swayed by the Counsel of his Queens Uncle an Alien, sends for his
father in Law to help away with his money, marries Simon Mountford to his
sister the Widow of William Earl of Pembroke, a professed Nun, and of a
banished Frenchman makes him Earl of Leicester: But the Legate and Earl of
Leicester proved better than was expected (no thanks to the King, who
doubtless was no Prophet) the one endeavoring to pacify, not foment
divisions, which before was held a property inseparable from his office; The
other becoming a most earnest assertor of the English Liberties, as the
Sequel will manifest.

The Lords incensed with these perfidious and tyrannous dealings, Remonstrate
against him, and tell him of the profusion of his Treasure, gotten by Exaction
from the Subject, and cast away upon strangers, who only guide him, of the
infinite sums he had raised in his time, how there was no Archbishopric or
Bishopric, except York Lincoln, and Bath, but he had made benefit by their
vacancies, besides what fell by Abbyes, Earldoms, Baronies, and other Escheats;
and yet his Treasure which should be the strength of the State was nothing
increased. Lastly, That despising his Subjects Counsels he was so obsequious to
the will of the Romans, that he seemed the Popes feudary: the King hearing this
harsh note, and perceiving the Londoners and whole people ready to rise against
him, 23. Year.
first by the Legate attempts to win his Brother, now the head of the Lords
party, to side with Him, but failing in this he calls a Parliament, whether the
Lords come armed: Whereupon to gain time, the business is referred to the
order of certain grave personages, Articles drawn, sealed, and publicly set up
with the eals of the Legate and diverse great men, the King taking his Oath to
stand to their determinations: but whilst the business was debating, he
corrupts his Brother, and the Earl of Lincoln, whereby the Lords are weakened,
the business is dashed, and the miseries of the Kingdom continued.

Simon Montford is thrown out of favor, 24. Year
and the Seal taken from him, and his brother Geoffrey a Knight Templer, put
out of the Counsel, Men much maligned, as evil Counselors, so inconstant are
Tyrants in their favors: they lost their places for refusing to pass a grant
of 4 pence upon every sack of wool made by the King to the Earl of Flanders the
Queens Uncle, to whom the next year he gave a pension of 300 marks per annum
out of the Exchequer: and here by their dejection we may observe, that Officers
under bad Princes are not always so bad as men account them, and that when the
Master plays the wreaks, the servant bears the burden.

But it seems one Gulf sufficed not to swallow up the substance of the
Kingdom, and therefore the Pope adds extortion to the Kings exaction, and sends
to have 300 Romans preferred to the next vacant benefices in England, which
mandate so amazed the Archbishop of Canterbury, that seeing no end of these
Concussions of the State, and liberties of the Church, he gives over his Sea,
and pays 800 marks to the Pope for his Fine: We need never doubt sure but that
they paid well for it who were to have it, when so much was given by him that
left it. He demands a tenth also of the Clergy; who flying to the King for
protection against the Popes rapine, were referred to the Legate: yea and the
chief of them offered to be delivered up unto him by the King, who joined with
the Pope we may see to aw and punish the Kingdom: and though they in the
Council then called stood out for a while against the Legate, yet at length by
the Treason of division, the body of the Council is entered into, and the Pope
prevails in this business.

Neither was Pope, and King enough, the Queens kindred must have a share, one
of whose Uncles comes into England, is feasted sumptuosly, Knighted, and the
Earldom of Richmond with other gifts bestowed on him, and the Archbishopric
of Canterbury conferred on his Son; but the poor Jews fasted for this, who were
forced to pay 20000 marks at two Terms that year.

The King being set agogg to be doing in France, 29. Year
by his Father in Law and others, the authors of his first Expedition, summons
a Parliament, and moves the matter therein; but it was generally opposed as a
design not feasible and expensive, besides the unlawfulness of breaking Truce;
Money also was denied, though the King came in person most submissively craving
their aid, with a letter from the Pope to boot in his hand. Nevertheless, what
by gifts and loans from particular men, by begging and borrowing, he scraped so
much together, that he carried over with him 30 barrels of Stirling Coin, and
yet before the end of the year he got Escuage toward his charges, which he lay
spending at Bourdeaux to little or no purpose.

He sent for Grain and Bacon, and had 10000 quarters of Wheat 5000 of Oats,
27. Year.
and as many Bacons shipped away, most of which perished by Shipwreck, the very
Elements seeming discontented, as well as the English Lords at his unworthy
carriage in undervaluing their Counsels, and preferring strangers, upon whom he
consumed his treasure in such sort, as caused his Brother and most of the
English Lords to desert him and come over, the wiser they, for the Earl of
Leicester and others which staid behind, ran behind hand too as well as the
King, by borrowing large sums to defray their expenses; at last He was driven
to make a dishonorable Truce with the French King, and return, having not
gained so much as 30 empty barrels were worth.

The Stangers having made up their mouths of him abroad, follow him hither
also, so greedy were these Harpies after prey, and so easy and ready was he to
be made one to them: and now the Countess of Provence the Queens Mother
bringing another daughter with her arrives at Dover, is sumptuously
entertained, and sent away richly rewarded; her daughter being immediately
bestowed on the Earl of Cornwall, who it seems had as good a stomach to
foreign flesh as the King his brother, that he could fall too so soon
without sauce; but the Earl was well beforehand in the world, and so might the
better dispense with the want of a portion.

Next slips in Martin the Popes collectour, furnished with such ample power of
cursing, suspending, excommunicating, pardoning (having whole droves of blanke
Bulls which might be filled up according to occasion) and all other
accoutrements belonging to, and necessary for St. Peter's successors trade,
which was fishing for money not men, that the former Legates were but fleas if
compared with this horseleech, who sucketh so sorely, that the King, what to
pacify the people, and what for fear nothing would be left him, should this
cormorant fish on, humbly beseeches the Pope, that Fleece, Skin, Flesh and all
might not be torn away, and nothing but the Bones left him for his fees, but he
might have had as much kindness of a Wolf for a good word, and as soon have
kept that hungry Beast from the fold by a Petition, as his Holiness, who
though he appear in sheeps clothing, has the wolfes conditions, and is only
to be hunted or cudgeled from worrying the flock.

No doubt this tender hearted Vicar had such a care of their souls, that
regarding neither his own, nor their bodies, he endeavored to beggar them if
possible, in hopes that being poor they would receive the Gospel; and in
truth next unto Gods goodness, the Popes wickedness was the means of this
nations receiving the truth, who by his pride and covetousness caused Henry
the 8th (a King as proud as he for his heart, and in more want for his purse)
to kick him out, which was the first step to Reformation of Religion.

Yet though the King could obtain no redress of the Pope, he prevails with him
to lay on more loads, getting Letters to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal to
help him to money in the Parliament now assembled at Westminster, which
notwithstanding the Kings personal, and Popes literal entreaties, will grant
none until he give assurance of Reformation, and the due execution of Laws;
they require also that 4 Peers should be chosen as conservators of the Kingdom,
which should be sworn of the Kings Counsel, see justice observed, and the
treasure issued out; That the chief Iusticiar and Chancellor should be of the
four, or chosen by the Parliament, together with two Justices of the Benches,
two Barons of the Exchequer, and one Justice for the Jews, that as their
function was public, so might also their Election be: but as the Devil would
have it (says one) the Popes Nuncio spoils all by demanding money of them
toward the Popes Wars against the Emperor, a Son in Law to England, having
married one of her Daughters; thus was not the Pope ashamed to demand money for
the King, but to sing the second part to the same tune in the same Parliameut,
on his own behalf; an impudency so monstrous, that we might well question it,
came it not from that strumpet of Rome; and seting aside doctrine, by practice
we may easily perceive, who is meant in the Revelation by the Whore of Babylon;
but the peremptory demand received an absolute repulse, and the Pope could get
nothing, but they granted Escuage, toward marriage of his eldest daughter, to
the King, twenty shillings of every Knights fee.

The King also upon a light occasion makes a great and expensive preparation
against Scotland, and the Earl of Flanders thirsting after his money comes over
with a ragged Regiment to help, whose unnecessary presence was nothing
acceptable to the Barons, as if the strength of England could not be sufficient
without him for that action, which was as suddenly ended as undertaken, by a
fair conclusion of peace.

The King assembles another Parliament, which would grant Him no more money,
29. Year.
though he told them his debts were so great that he could not appear out of
his Chamber, for the clamor of those to whom he owed money for his Wine, Wax,
and other necessaries of his House, hereupon he falls to other violent courses,
and first he picks a quarrel with the Londoners, and makes them pay 15000
marks for receiving a banished man into their City, notwithstanding they
produced his pardon under the great Seal, which they were told was purchased
when the King was under age: Thus, because the Lion would have it so, the Asses
ears must be horns, well fare the Fox therefore which had the wit not to come
to Court.

Observe here the happy estate of our Ancestors under Monarchy, who, if they
gained but this advantage (though attended with many inconveniences and
mischiefs, incident to all Nations in their Kings minority) of receiving a few
good Grants, and enjoying a pittance of Freedom, once in 4 or 5 ages when their
King was too young to play Rex, and there happened a wise and honest Protector;
yet were sure to pay through the nose for it afterward with double and treble
interest for forbearance.

Then employes one Passeleave in a peremptory Commission to enquire of all
Lands which had been dis-forested, and either to fine the occupiers at
pleasure, or take them from them, and sell the same to others, if they would
give more for them, and in this such rigor was shown, that multitudes were
undone, yet Passeleave should have been preferred to the Bishopric of
Chichester for his good service, had not the Bishops opposed the King therein.

Thus have we not seen with our own eyes, whole Counties almost to be
challenged for Forest, and our selves like to have been forced to purchase our
own estates from Charles, to save our habitations from becoming the places of
Wild Beasts?

The Lords also making bold to open the Popes packet to Martin, found therein
such vilany, that the Nuncio was forthwith commanded out of the Land, who so
basely had behaved himself, that he both needed, and yet could hardly obtain a
safe Conduct to preserve him from the violence of the enraged people; and now
the King being incensed also at the Popes oppressions, or at least seeming to
be so, since his cheats were made public, the Parliament make use of the good
mood he was in, and lay before him, how that Italians Revenues in England,
amounted to sixty thousand marks yearly, besides the Popes Exactions, which so
moved him that he caused all to be notified, and by Commissioners sent to the
General Council at Lions demanding redress; which together with Martins
usage, so vexed the Pope, that he endeavored to set the French King upon his
back.

30. Year.
In the Parliament holden at Westminster, upon the Popes rejecting the
Consideration of these grievances, and despising the Kings Messages (saying,
that he began to Frederize) it was Enacted and Ordained, under great penalty,
That no Contribution of money should be given to the Pope by any Subject of
England, and the same confirmed in a Parliament at Winchester, and another at
London: The King also bustles against the Popes Exactions, in such sort that it
gave hope of redress; but this heat was soon chilled by the Popes threats, of
so irresolute and wavering a nature was the King, Woman-like, giving over what
he manfully undertook; but this may seem to confirm what was hinted before,
that what he did was rather out of policy to delude the people (whose rage was
risen so high, that he feared to meet it) than a just sense of their misery,
who in all things else which stood with his humor or advantage was more than
enough stubborn and stiff.

And now the Pope having given, or rather taken the foil, continues his former
rapine, yet fearing if he kicked too hard, he might be thrown out of the
Saddle, he seems openly to surcease, and promises never to send any more Legates
into England, and underhand effects his will by other Ministers, termed Clerks,
who had the same power, though a different title, the former being too eminent
for his clandestine transactions, which the King furthers him in all he can, so
cordial was the reconcilement, which shows it was not effected by fear.

And to give them their due, both played their parts very dexterously (if the
term may be proper for a sinister practice) The Pope ranting as high in the
Counsel, as the King vapoured in the Parliament, saying, It is fit that we make
an end with the Emperor, that we may crush these petty Kings; for the Dragon
once appeased or destroyed, these lesser Snakes will soon be trodden down. But
had he thought Henry one in earnest, he would not so soon have received him
into his bosom.

Peter of Savoy, 31. Year
before made Earl of Richmond, comes over again, (it may seem the King by his
pretended forwardnes against the Pope, had got some money) bringing with him
young wenches out of Provence, which were married to Noblemen, who were the
Kings wards, as to the Earls of Lincoln, Kent, etc. and to be sure Peter lost
nothing by such bargains, though the Nobility were abused in a barbarous, and
tyrannical manner.

Comes again the Countess of Provence, 32. Year,
who lost nothing by the voyage, though she had delivered Provence and sixteen
Castles as a dowry with her Daughter, married to Charles the French Kings
Brother, unto the French, contrary to equity, (the Queen of England being the
eldest Daughter) and Covenant too, having promised it to the King, and received
for five years 4000 marks annual pension in consideration of the pact; so
fatally infatuated was this King, that he cared not how he lavished out upon
such cheats, what he scrued and wrung from his Subjects.

And besides Thomas of Savoy titular Earl of Flanders, who came over with her,
three of the Kings half-Brothers are sent for over to be provided of Estates in
England, which it seems he intended to divide between his own and his Wives
beggarly kindred; and truly by this Kings actions a man would guess he thought
he had been set up only to impoverish his Subjects, and enrich Aliens; and as
he, so almost every King played their prizes, the only difference being that
strangers were not always the objects of their profuseness; yet King James
imitated him in every circumstance, who gave away so fast unto Scots the
English Lands (and they to relieve their penury felled the woods so lustily)
that for ought could be guessed, Trees would have been as thin here as in
Scotland, had not the Lords, by money, hired his jester Green to give a stop to
his Carriere (they themselves not daring to give check to the Magisteriall Scot
in his vanity) by making a Coat with Trees and Birds on them, and telling him,
questioning and wondering at the humor, That if the Woods were felled so fast
by his Country men a little longer, Birds must perch upon Fools Coats, for no
Trees would be left them to sit upon: Thus also was the Lord Cobham and Sir
Walter Rawleys estates conferred on favorites; and they made Traitors, that
Court Hang-bies might be made Lords and Gentlemen; and to say the truth, in
this point, all or most of our Monarchs have so behaved themselves, as if, with
the Country fellow at Doctors Commons, they thought England was dead
detestable, had made them her executioners, and they were come to the Crown to
diminish her goods.

But to return where we left. Henry was so lavish, and his Guests so unwilling
to seem unmannerly, and refuse his kindness, that his baggs were now become as
empty, as his barrels were before; A Parliament therefore is summoned at
London, and money demanded; but they put him in mind of his Guests, and
besides sharply reprehended Him, For his breach of promise in requiring another
aid, having vowed and declared, upon his last supply, never more to injure the
state in that kind; for his violent taking up of provisions for diet, wax,
silks, robes, but especially wine, contrary to the will of the owners, whereby
Merchants will withdraw their Commodities, and all Trade and Commerce utterly
ceases, to the detriment and infamy of this Kingdom; That his Judges were sent
in Circuit under pretense of justice to fleece the people: That Passeleave had
wrung from the Borderers on Forests vast sums of money, they wonder therefore
he should now demand relief from the impoverished Commons; They advise him to
pull from his favorites, enriched with the Treasure of the Kingdom, to support
his prodigality, since his needless expenses amounted to above 800000 l. since
he began his destructive Reign. (postquam Regni caepit esse dilapidator) thus
plainly durst our generous Ancestors tell a Tyrant his own to his teeth. Then
they reprove Him, For keeping vacant in his hands, Bishoprics, and Abbeys,
contrary to the Liberties of the Church, and his Oath taken at his Coronation.
Which it seems was judged more than a Ceremony in those days, though in ours,
the contrary has so falsely, and impudently been asserted. Lastly, they
generally complain, for that the chief Iusticia, Chancellor, Treasurer, etc.
were not made by the Common Council of the Kingdom, according as they were in
the time of his magnificent predecessors, and as as it was fit and expedient;
but such advanced as followed his will, in whatsoever tended to his gain, and
sought promotion not for the good of the Kingdom, but their own profit.

Here we may obsetve that it was no new doctrine, which our Parliament in the
beginning taught us, but that it was practiced, as well as thought fit so to
be, by our Ancestors, though the Royal Penmen in their Declarations boldly
and publicly avowed the contrary.

With this reprehension the King was netled, as his speech the next Session
makes out, for though he promised amendment they would not believe him, and
therefore prorogued the Parliament till Midsummer, that they might see whether
he would be as good as his word. (We must know Kings were not grown so impudent
and daring then, as to dissolve Parliaamens at their own pleasures.) But he
mended like sour Ale in Summer, his heat it seems increasing with the Seasons,
and in the next Session, with an Imperious and Magisteriall brow thus
expostulates with them, Would you curb the King your Lord at your uncivil
pleasure, and impose a servile condition on him? will you deny unto him what
everyone of you as you list may do? it is lawful for every one of you to use
what Counsel, and every Master of a Family to prefer to any office in his
house whom he pleases, and displace again when he list, and will you rashly
deny your Lord the King to do the like? Whereas servants ought not to judge
their Master, and Subjects their Prince, or hold them to their cond^tions. For
the Servant is not above his Lord, nor the D^sciple above his Master; neither
should he be your King, but as your Servant, who should so incline to your
pleasure. Wherefore know I will yield to none of your desires.

A brave ranting speech, yet I hope it will not be denied but they were evil
Counselors, which put this into that Kings mouth, though they have been, who
penned the late Kings Declarations, which were so like this speech, as they
could not be more, though Charles his Declarations had been spit out of Henry's
mouth; in both we may perceive the humor equally proud in the Kings, and
jointly mischievous in their Counselors, the first accounting their Subjects
but their slaves, the second making themselves such to curry favor with their
Lordly Masters; for let what palliations or disguizes soever of evil
Counselors be made to cover the shame of evil Princes, wise men know, and it
has always been found by experience, that the Tyranny of the Kings, bears the
first, and the slavery of the instruments but the second part, in the causality
of the mischiefs, and that these Lions rampant, will make use of none but Asses
couchant, which are most willing, as well as most able, to bear the load.

Thus Henry he heaps his favors upon Strangers most, because they were aptest
to serve his turn; and thus many in our days have been preferred and enriched,
not because the King loved Laud, Wentworth, Buckingham, D^gby, etc. better than
others, but because these were the fittest instruments to drive on the trade of
Tyranny.

But to the story. Herry would have money, and the Parliament would have a
redress of grievances, which his speech absolutely denies they should, and so
they break up in discontent: but though his stomach was so high, his purse was
so low as he was forced to sell his plate, and jewels of the Crown. We see here
that the late King had a President for what he did, and a very goodly one too;
but what will not Princes devoted to Tyranny sacrifice, to obtain their
lustings? give, pawn, sell all they can lay their clutches on to carry on their
design, which being accursed, and abominable, none will be subservient to, but
they will be soundly paid paid for it: and truly these slavish wretches buy
their Gold too dear, selling their fame, together with their honesty for a
little trash, which commonly is torn from them by the hand of justice, which
makes them behold the loss of all they accounted and purchased so dear, before
it puts out their eyes by a shameful death: no marvel therefore Tyrants are so
beggarly, being forced to hire their journymen at such high rates.

He sends his letters Imperiously deprecatory to aid him with money, 33. Year
which with much grudging they do, to the sum of 20000l. having the Christmas
before required New Years gifts of the same Londoners, in hope (no doubt) but
to get some of his plate and jewels again, which they had bought of him a
little before: Also by calling the Nobles and wealthiest persons apart, he
scrapes up something; yet when the Abbot of Borrough denied him a 100 marks as
he required, he told him it was more Charity to give an alms to him, than to a
Beggar that went from door to door; to this lowness had his profufe and
tyrannical courses exposed him.

The Jews also were fleeced by the King again, of whose sufferings we may take
a guess, by what one of them protested upon the faith he owed to his law to be
true, to wit, that the King had within 7. years space taken from him thirty
thousand marks in Silver, besides 200 in Gold given to the Queen.

And the Londoners, in requital of their bounty, forced to shut up their
shops, and keep St. Edwards Fair 15 days togegether at Westminster, in a very
wet and dirty season, being also fined 1000 marks for beating some of the Kings
Servants who came and reviled them, as they were at their sport of running at
the Quintan: Thus his very Servants were willing to be beaten, that their
Master might get money by it.

35
The Monks of Duresme refusing to prefer his half Brother to that Bishopric,
he goes to Winchester to make sure of that by his presence for him: where
entering the Chapter House, he gets into the Chair, begins a Sermon, and takes
this Text, Justice and Peace have kissed each other; which he thus handles. To
me, and other Kings belongs the rigor of justice; to you, who are men of quiet,
and religion, peace; and this day I hear you have for your own good been
favorable to my request: Justice and Peace has kissed each other. Once I was
offended with you, for withstanding me in the election of your late Bishop, but
now I am friends with you for this and will both remember and reward your
kindness. As by a woman came destruction into the world, so by a Woman came the
remedy: I to satisfy my Wife, and prefer her Uncle, disquieted, and damnified
you: So now to advance my Brother by the Mother, will reconcile my self to you,
etc. Thus went he on blasphemously wresting and abusing Scripture: yet could
not the Geese beware when the Fox preached, for he gains his desire, and that
Chair was more propitious to him, than the Speakers was to CHARLES, into which,
in imitation of Henry, he violently thrust himself.

At York the marriage of his Daughter with the King of Scots, was solemnized in
the height of riot, and lavish expense, to recruit which, the King is forced to
find a new shift to get money; He will needs take the Cross upon him, and away
to the Holy Wars, and to carry out the business the more impudently, takes his
Oath, laying his right hand on his breast, and after on the Book, to perform
the journey; Which all knew was pretended only to get Cash: and now his good
friend at need the Pope, with a great deal of gravity, ushers on the Imposture,
granting him a tenth of both Clergy and Laity for three years; which had it
been collected, would have amounted to six hundred thousand pound: A sum
which might have afforded him a large Bribe for a dispensation.

36. Year.
A Parliament is called to London about this tenth, which was denied by all,
this put the King in such rage, that he drove all out of his Chamber, as if he
had been mad: but coming to himself again, he falls to his old trick of
dealing with them apart, and first sends for the Bishop of Ely, who plainly
telling him He neither could nor would go contrary to the whole State, and
diswading him from the journey, by the example of the King of France, on whom
they might see the punishment of God to be fallen for his rapine, made on his
peoples substance, etc. drove him into such a passion, that he commanded the
Bishop to be thrust out of doors.

Being thus disappointed by the Parliament, he falls to his former violent
courses, and maintenance of his strangers in all their riots and oppressions,
insomuch that it was the general exclamation, Our Inheritance is given to
Aliens, and our houses to strangers: but we shall perceive the oppressions then
on foot, if we consider but what was told the King by diverse to his face.

The Countess of Arundell being harshly denied, by the King about a Ward
detained from her in regard of a small parcel of Land held in capite, which
drew away all the rest, thus spoke, My Lord, why turn you away your face from
Justice, that we can obtein no right in your Court? you are constituted in the
midst betwixt God andus; but neither govern your self, nor us discreetly as
you ought; you shamefully vex both the Church and Nobles of the Kingdom, by all
means you can. To which the King floutingly answered, saying, Lady Countess;
have the Lords made you a Charter, and sent you to be their Prolocutrix? She
replies, No Sir, They have not made any Charter to me; but the Charter which
your Father and you made, and swore so often to observe, and so often extorted
from your Subjects their money for the same, you unworthily transgress, as a
manifest breaker of your faith: where are the Liberties of England so often
written, so often granted, so often bought? I, though a Woman, and with me all
your natural and faithful people, appeal against you to the Tribunal of that
high Judge above, and Heaven and Earth shall be our witness, that you have
most unjustly dealt with us, and Lord God of revenge, avenge us. Behold a
generous and knowing Lady, it was the sufferings of her Country, not her self
(of which we find no mention) extorted this true and resolute complaint from
her. Upon the ruins of Henry's fame, has I sabell raised an eternal trophie
of her Virtue, which shall stand conspicuous in English History, so long as any
memory of England remains.

Thus the Master of the Hospitallers tells the King, saying, he would revoke
those Charters and Liberties inconsiderately granted by him and his
Predecessors, and for it alleging the Popes practice, who many times chashiered
his Grants. So long as you observe Justice you may be a King, and as soon as
you violate the same, you shall leave to be a King A Truth more Sacred than his
Majesty could be, and not to be violated for the sake of millions of Tyrants.

But above all for wonder, is that of the Friars Minors, who returned a load of
Freeze he sent them with this Message, that he ought not to give alms of what
he had Rent from the poor. Indeed obedience is better than sacrifice, but had
this conscience been used by all the Romish Clergy, their bellies had been
leaner, though their souls might have got by it their temporalities less,
though their spirituality more; and this act deserves an Euge to these, though
it create an Apage, to others, and rises in judgment condemning those great
Clergy men, who have been less than these Minors in Conscience and Honesty.

At last, 37. Year.
the King having a mind to have another bout beyond Sea, summons a Parliament
at London, and now there is no doubt, but he would be so gracious as to grant
them what they could desire. O what a blessed thing is want of money, and how
bountiful are Kings when they are quite beggared? they will pull down
Star-chambers, High Commission courts, Monopolies, suffer Favorites to be
called to accouut for Treasons and vilanies they set them a work to do, when
they can do no other, can neither will nor chose; and will grant trienniall
Parliaments, and pass Acts that a Parliament shall sit so long as it will, and
which it might have done without their leave, when all the devices and power
they can make are not able to hinder it; well though that proverb says,
Necessity has no law, yet with reverence to it is antiquity, I must contrarily
affirm, that had it not been for necessity England had never had good law, made
nor kept, neither ever should so long as the Norman yoke was in fashion.

This Gaffer Necessity at the first word obtains what all the Lords, Prelates,
Parliaments, so long demanded in vain; Henry so the Parliament will but relieve
him, will ratify and confirm their Liberties, they do it, granting him a tenth
of the Clergy for three years, and Escuage three marks of every Knights Fee of
the Laity for one year, toward his journey into the Holy Land, indeed
Gascoigne; which how holy soever Henry accounted it, he could never yet bring
any relics out of it, though he had carried many a Cross into it and he
accordingly ratifies those often-confirmed Charters, in the most solemn and
ceremonial manner that the Religion of that time, and the wisdom of the State
could then devise to do

For the Parliament having so often found by experience, that no civil promise
or verbal profession, would hold in these Norman Lords, raptured by
Prerogative, and devoted to perjury to maintain tyranny; take now a more
Ecclesiastical, and divine way of Obligation, swearing to Excommunicate all
who should be found infringers of the Charters.

And the King with all the great Nobility, all the Prelates in their Vestments,
with burning Candles in their hands, assemble in the great Hall at Westminster
to receive that dreadful sentence; The King having received a Candle, gives it
to a Prelat, saying, it becoms not me being no Priest to hold this, my heart
shall be a greater testimony; and withal lays his hand spread upon his Breast
the whole time the sentence was pronounced, which was Authoritate Dei
Omnipotentis, etc. which done he causes the Charter of King John his Father to
be read likewise openly; in the end, having thrown away their Candles, which
lay smoking on the ground, they cried out, So let them which incur this
sentence be extinct, and stink in Hell; and the King with a loud voice said,
As God me help I will, as I am a Man, a Christian, a Knight, a King Crowned and
Anointed, inviolably observe all these things.

Never were Laws (says that witty Historian) amongst men (except those holy
Commandments on the Mount) established with more Majesty of Ceremony to make
them reverend, and respected, than these were; they wanted but Thunder and
Lightning from Heaven, which likewise if prayers could have effected, they
would have had, to make the sentence ghastly and hideous to the infringers
thereof.

Yet no sooner was this Parliament dissolved by a sacred and most solemn
conclusion, but the King presently studies to infringe all, and with a part of
the money he then got, purchasing an absolution of the Pope, returns to his
former oppressive courses, with more violence and hardness; and for ought we
know our late King had the like to help him over all those styles, for Master
Prynne tells us, there was an English Lieger in Rome, and our own eyes, that
there were Nuntio's here at home, to continue a correspondence between the
Pope, and his Royal Favorite.

Thus what the King does, the Pope undoes for money, so cursed a thirst after
Gold was in both: It is no wonder therefore some of Henry's late successors
were hying so fast to Rome, who being troubled with the same disease, stood in
need of the same Mountebanke: and no doubt but Venus has obtained Armor of
proof of Vulcan for her wandering AEneas, so that the King of Scots is well
provided against the Covenants pearcing him to the heart, by the care of his
Mother, and art of his holy Father.

But to return to Henry, whom we see the greatest security that could be
given, and that under the greatest penalty, an Oath could not hold; who would
therefore suppose that he or any Kings of such metal should ever be believed
again by any who write themselves men (Creatures in whose composition are many
ounces of reason) when the only Chain upon earth besides Love to tie the
Conciences of men, and humane society together (which should it not hold, all
the frame of Government must fall asunder, and men like Beasts be left to
force, that whosoever is the stronger may destroy the other) has been so often
and suddenly broken by the Norman tyrants, in whom this perjury ran in a blood
almost to a miracle? or who could think Master Prynne who in print takes notice
of their frequent violations, would ever be drawn by corrupt interest to have
his Countries Liberties sent to Sea to seek their fortunes in so rotten a
Bottom.

These Deeds being done, succeeds one so monstrous, that we must almost run
half way to Credulity to be able to meet it; for this perjured Prince was not
ashamed to send his Brother over to summon the Estates, and demand of them (the
Wounds yet fresh and bleeding made by his impieties) another Subsidy, but the
Parliament denied him, to the great exasperation of the Tyrant: yet the Earl of
Cornwall forced the Jews to pay a great Sum, that he might not return empty
handed to his Brother, who staid until he had consumed all that ever he could
get in this Journey, which with the other two made before, cost him seven and
twenty hundred thousand pounds, more than all his Lands there were They to be
sold were worth, besides thirty thousand Marks, with Lands, Rents, Wards,
Horses, and Jewels, to an inestimable price, thrown away upon his half-brothers.

After all this he returns, and the first that felt their good Lord was come
again, were the Londoners, and the Jews, who paid soundly for his Welcome. The
Londoners presenting him with an hundred pounds were returned without Thanks or
Money, for he was not altogether so unmannerly as to deny to receive it, then
being persuaded Plate would be better welcome, they send him a fair Vessel,
worth two hundred pounds; this had some Thanks, but yet would not serve the
turn.

For the Pope having bestowed the Kingdom of Sicil on the Kings younger Son
(which the Earl of Cornwall wisely refused, 39. Year.
knowing the Pope was never so liberal of any thing which was his own) the
King to gain this makes all the money he can get out of his Coffers, and
Exchequer, or borrow of his Brother, or scrape from the Jews, or extort by the
rapine of his Justices itinerants, which he gives to the Pope to maintain his
Wars against Conrade King of Sicil, (you see there was a right Owner of what
the Pope was so liberal) and yet all this would not do, for the Pope writes for
more, who was loath to be a Niggard of another Purse; upon this Henry sends
him Letters Obligatory, signed with his Seal, with Blanks left to put in what
Sums he would, or could get of the Merchants of Italy, desiring him to stick
upon no interest, all which was so effectually performed, that he was put in
Debt no lesser Sum than three hundred thousand Marks, and yet no Sicil was got.

Upon this a Parliament is summoned, and of them money required, which though
they promised to grant upon condition he would swear without all cavillation to
observe the Charters, and let the Chief Iusticiar, Chancellor and Treasurer be
elected by the common Council of the Realm, would not be hearkened to: for
though he cared not a fig for his Oath, yet it seems those Officers might have
restrained him from disposing of his Cash at list, and not suffer his Holiness
to have a Penny, whereby he might have wanted his Dispensation, or else the
humor of Tyranny was so high, that all his penury was not able to check it for
one moment.

The King thus being left unprovided, the Bishop of Hereford Agent for the
Prelates at Rome, like a trusty Steward finds a shift to help him, for getting
certain Authentic Seals from them, upon pretense of dispatching some business
for them, by License of the Pope and King, he sets them to writings of such
Sums of Money taken up of Italian Merchants for their Use, and so makes them
pay the Kings scores.

He seizes also the Liberties of the City of London, into his hands, upon the
pretense of their letting a Prisoner escape, making them fine three thousand
Marks to himself, and six hundred to his Brother; he requires of the Jews* upon
pain of hanging, a Tallage of eight thousand Marks; and thus having fleeced
them, he set them to farm to his Brother; who upon Pawns lent him a huge mass
of Money; then the City Liberties are seized again, but upon payment of four
hundred Marks restored.

And to add to all, one Ruscand a Legate from the Pope comes and demands the
Tenth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, to the use of the King, and Pope,
preaching the Cross against the King of Sicil but the Clergy protesing rather
to lose their Lives and Livings than yield thus to the will of the Pope, and
King, who they said, were as the Shepherd and the Wolf combined to macerate the
Flock; were ordered to some tune, for the Legate suspended and excommunicated
them, and the King if they submitted not in forty days spoiled them of all
their Goods as forfeited.

40. Year
All men by Proclamation that could dispend fifteen pound per annum were
commanded to come in, and receive the Order of Knighthood, or else pay their
Fines, as was before done in the 37. year: and every sheriff was fined 5 marks
for not distreyning on all whom the Proclamation reached; this trick was shown
in our days, lest any oppression should escape unexercised.

41. Year
A Parliament was held, wherein the Prelates and Clergy offered him upon
condition the Charters might be observed, 52000 marks, but it satisfied him
not, for he demanded the Tenths for 3. years, without deduction of expenses,
and the first fruits for the same time.

42. Year
Another was called to London, wherein upon the Kings pressing Them for releife
to pay his depts, He is plainly told, They will not yield to pay him any thing,
and if unadvisedly he without their consents and counsels bought the Kingdom
of Sicill, and had been deceived, he should impute it to his own imbecility,
and have been instructed by the provident example of his Brothe^, who
absolutely refused it, in regard it lay so far off, so many Nations between,
the cavils of the Popes, the infidelity of the People, and the power of the
pretenders. They also repeat the Kingdoms grievances, The breach of his
promises, and most solemn Oaths: the insolence of his Brethren, and other
strangers, against whom by his Order, no Writ was to pass out of the Chancery;
how they abounded all in riches, and himself was so poor that he could not
repress the Welsh, who wasted his Country, but going against them was forced
to return with dishonor. The King seeing his friend Necessity was at his Elbow,
humbles himself, tells them, how he had often by evil Counsel been seduced, and
promises by his Oath, which he takes on the Tomb of Saint Edw. to reform all
these Errors: but the Lords not knowing how to hold this ever-changing Proteus,
for security adjourn the Parliament to meet at Oxford, in which time they
provided for their own, and the Kingdoms safety.

The King in the mean while is put to his shifts, and upon promise of high
preferment, gets the Abbot of Westminster to put his and his Covents Seal to a
Deed obligatory, as a surety for threehundred marks; sending by Passeleave this
Deed, with his Letters, unto other Monasteries, to invite them to do the like;
but notwithstanding his threats, telling them how all they had came from the
benignity of Kings, and how their Sovereign was Lord of all they had. They
refused to yield to any such deed, saying, They acknowledged the King to be
Lord of all they had, but so as to defend, not to destroy the same.

And now the Parliament meets at Oxford, and in this it is Enacted that the
Poictovins and strangers should avoid the Land, with many other profitable Laws
for that time. The Charters are confirmed, and the King and Prince sworn to
restore the ancient Laws and Institutions of the Realm, and to observe
inviolable the Ordinances of that Parliament. Now the chief Iusticiar,
Chancellor, and all other great and public Officers, are elected by the common
and public Counsel, which power was, as we may see before, usurped by the
Norman Tyrants, and worn as an especial flowr of their Crowns, and fruit of
our slavery: for it is manifest to any, unless such as will wink, that our
English Kings were but as Generals in War, without any other great
jurisdiction; our wise Ancestors knowing such a trust enough for one, and
therefore kept the Election of other Great Officers in their own power, until
it was wrested out of their hands by the Norman Tyrants, and that not so much
by the Sword, as by craft; thus though William surnamed the Bastard had
defeated Harold in the field; yet upon his Coronation he swore to maintain the
ancient Laws, Liberties, and Customs of the English Nation, and again renewed
his Oath, and granted the same too by Charter, but when he was thoroughly settled
in his seat he perfidiously broke all, imposed the Norman Laws, and those in
the Norman tongue, as a badge of our slavery, and a means to entrap the
English, who not understanding them* knew not how to avoid the incurring the
penalties; whereby his Normans mouths up were made with their Estates, and thus
his Successors were forced to swear and forswear to maintain themselves in
their Kingships.

The Poictovins and strangers being banished, presently follows the death and
sickness of diverse Noblemen, who had been poisoned by their practice: and a
Steward of the Earl of Glocesters was executed for it, he having received a
great sum of William de Valence the head of the Poictovins to work the feat.
And though the Kings Favorites cried out that he was condemned only upon
presumption, yet the evidence will appear very strong, if we consider, that his
Lord, and his Lords brother were poisoned, the latter dying, the former lying
sick a long while, having his body swelled, his nails and hair fallen off, and
this Steward convinced to have received a great sum of the Poictovin their
Enemy, for whom he could make out no service to be ever done, unless what was
laid to his charge; besides, a Jew being converced a little after, confessed
the poison was prepared in his house.

The Earl of Cornwall (now King of the Romans) returns into England, 43. Year
and upon his arrival takes an Oath to observe inviolably, and obey the
Statutes and Ordinances made by the late Parliament at Oxford.

A Parliament was summoned at Westminster, 44. Year
wherein were read and confirmed all the Statutes of Oxford, and such
pronounced acursed by the Prelates, which should attempt in word or deed to
infringe any of the same: Whereupon Escuage is granted to the King, forty
shillings of every Knights Fee; a very considerable sum in those days, for
there were above forty thousand Knights Fees in England at that time.

But the King having an intent to break more Oaths, and knowing that now it
would not so easily be done, makes a Voyage over Sea to conclude a peace with
France, that he might not be interrupted in the game he meant to play at home,
having dispatched Messengers secretly to Rome, for absolution of his Oath, and
to Scotland for aids to be ready upon occasion

When he had concluded with the King of France, 45. Year
having made an absolute resignation of the Duchy of Normandy, the Earldoms of
Anjou, Poictou, Tourenne and Main, upon the receipt of 300000 Crowns, and a
Grant to enjoy what he had in Guien, Xantongue, etc. doing homage and fealty to
the Crown of France, He returns, and comes to London, where he presently
fortifies the Tower, caused the Gates of the City to be Warded, and then to
pick a quarrel commands the Lords to come to a Parliament to be holden in the
Tower, which they refusing, as he knew they would, he takes an Oath of all
above 12 years of age in London, to be true to Him and His Heirs, and sets
armed men to defend the City Gates, For fear sure the Parliament should have
come in, and so spoiled the design, For neither Henry or any of our former
Kings were ever so daring as to contest with a Parliament in the field or set
up their standards against it, but were always forced to grant its demands, or
quietly sit down without having their own turn served, when the Parliament was
willing to dissolve.

And now Henry being provided for the work, 46. Year
causes the Popes Bull, purchased for absolving himself, and all others sworn
to maintain the Statutes of Oxford, to be read publicly at Pauls-Crosse, and
makes Proclamation that all should be proceeded against as Enemies to his Crown
and Royal dignity, who should disobey the absolution; and such was the
blindness and slavery of many in those times, that one Bull begot thousands of
Calves in an instant: and yet it seems veal was never the cheaper, for his Son
the Prince was forced to rob the Treasury at the New Temple to buy him
Provision, every one refusing to lend him or the King a groat, so great credit
had their perfidie got them.

47. Year
Many being clapped up in prison who would not be perjured, the Lords, and others
whose consciences were more tender both of their Oath and Liberties than to
believe the Pope, or trust the King, assemble together in arms for defense of
themselves and their liberties, and first they send to the King humbly
beseeching him to remember his many Oaths, and promises, but when that would
not avail them, they advance toward London, where the King lay in the Tower
waiting the gathering of his forces, and the coming over of strangers which he
expected; and now the Bishops (who as they were seldom in any good, so would be
sure to be chief in every bad action) make such a stir to prevent bloodshed
forsooth (of which their tenderness has always been well enough known) that
the controversy must be referred to the French King to decide; much honor got
England, and much liberty was like to get by such an Arbitratour, while she is
forced to creep to forraigners, to know whether they will please to let her
enjoy liberty or no, after 47 years oppression under Henry, besides what his
good Father and Grandsiers had loaded her with.

But the Lords being persuaded that their Liberties and Rights depended not
upon the will of any one Man refused to stand to the partial award of the
French in the English Tyrants behalf. Thus concluded this business (as all
others commonly did, which Bishops had a foot in^^ with a mischief to the
Commonwealth, the King gaining by it not only time for raising, but a seeming
justice for his using of Forces to compel the Lords to stand to the sentence,
by which their liberties were adjudged from them.

No doubt those wise and generous Barons not only disliked, but disdained such
an Vmpire, as being sensible of the advantages Henry, of the dishonor their
Country, and of the discommodity their cause would reap by him; but that those
Fathers in evil under the angelical shape of peacemakers, necessitated them to
accept of him, to avoid the obloquy of being Incendiaries, the involvers of
their Country in a miserable civil war.

Let the English High Priests then, to their eternal infamy, carry a frontlet
engraven with Mischief to England on their foreheads, who were the fatal
instruments of enforcing their Country to submit her liberty to a foreign
Tyrants decision, whose corrupt interest lay in adding fuel to the flames,
which consumed the Noblest Fabrics, the uprightest and firmest pillars in the
English Nation.

Yet that Henry might make a little better market for himself, 49 Year
he Summons a Parliament at Westminster, where whilst openly nothing but
redressing grievances, composing differences, exclaiming against jealousies
raised to scandalize the King, good man, as if he intended to leavy War against
his people, by factious spirits, proceeds from Henry, he underhand prepares for
War, endeavoring to divide the Barons, and strengthen himself by all the plots
and clandestine tricks he could; at last having by sprinkling Court holy water,
and promising fifty pound Lands per annum to such as would desert the Lords
party, drawn diverse to revolt unto him, he secretly withdraws from Westminster
to Windsor, and from thence to Oxford, and so on, traversing the Country, to
patch up, and piece together an Army: And here we may see it was no new thing
which was acted by his late successor, who in all his actions made it appear
that he was a right chip of the old block.

Now pretenses of the Barons insolences against the King, and oppressions of
the Subjects, Declarations of his being forced to take up arms for defense of
the just Laws and Liberties of the people, and his own safety, with
protestations of his good intentions, and diverse other such knacks are every
where on the wing, as we have had flying up and down at the tayss of the Royal
paper Kites of our times.

The Lords being thus left in the lurch, are not wanting in preparing for
defense, being unanimously backed by the citizens of London, who have hitherto
had the honor of bravely standing for Liberty; yet first they send to the
King, putting him in mind of his oaths and promises, and desiring him to
observe the great Charter and Oxford Statutes, but the Drums and Trumpets make
such music in his ears, that Henry will hear no talk of any Law, but what his
will and Sword shall give; and for their good Counsel, returns them as tokens
of his love the title of Rebels, and Traitors, which he as frankly bestows on
their persons, as he does their Lands on his followers.

By these course Complements the Lords perceiving which way the game was like
to go, leave off putting their confidence in the King, and trust their cause to
God and their good Swords; then choosing the Earls of Leicester and Gloucester
for their Generals (whose hands no manacle of alliance could lock from
defending their Countries Liberties, though the first had married the Sister,
the second the Niece of the King) they take the Field, may Towns are taken by
each party, and many skirmishes pass, wherein sometimes the one party,
sometimes the other get the better; at length diverse Scotch Lords, and others
with great forces being joined to the King, he marches against Northampton,
where he heard Peter Montford was assembling forces for the Barons: the Town
was very resolutely defended, until by the Treachery of some Monks within say
some, by the subtilty of the Kings Forces say others, (who advancing close
under the Wall, undermined it, whilst the Captains within parlying with the
King on the other side) a breach was made so large that forty Horse might enter
a breast, by which Henry gained it by assault.

This Town being taken ran the same fortune Leicester lately did, for Henry
drunk with success, and rage, like a violent Torrent swept all before him,
killing, burning, and spoiling where ever his Army came; but here, so unmanly
was the cruelty of the Tyrant, that he would have hanged all the Oxford
Scholars (a band of which were in the Town) for their valor showed in the
brave resistance of his forces, had not some of his Counselors persuaded him
from so doing, for fear (the only curb to an ignoble soul) of exasperating
their friends against him by his cruelty, many of the Scholars being young
Gentlemen of good quality.

Here by the way we may observe the miserable effects of bad Governors in the
Universities, by whom such degeneratenesse was wrought in our youth, that none
in our times were found more desperate engagers against the cause of Liberty,
than young Scholars, who heretofore were the most resolute Champions for it:
Let us therefore make no sinister constructions, when we see our Governors
diligent in purging the fountains, if we desire to have the streams run clear.

But Northampton put a period to Henry's fortune, for although he caused the
Barous to raise their siedge from Rochester, yet in the height of his jollity
he was defeated at Lews, such was the wages of Pride and Rage: And thus the
Sun setting at Leicester, went down at Naseby upon Charles, whose success
kept time with his presumption and cruelty.

And now Henry is pitched down at Jews, where the Barons petitioning for their
liberties, and desiring Peace, are answered by his proclaming them Rebels and
Traitors* and sending his own, his Brothers and Sons Letters of defiance unto
them: But this was too hot to hold, for the Lords perceiving what they must
trust to, notwithstanding the great numbers of the Enemy, the Banished
Poictovins being returned with great forces for his aid, bravely resolve to
give him battle, and as gallantly perform their resolutions, for fighting like
men for their Liberties, they gain the day, and take Him, his Brother and his
Son, with many English and Scotch Lords prisoners.

This victory was received with such universal joy, that when news came of the
Queens having a great Army of strangers ready to set sale for England, such
multitudes appeared on Barham Down to resist them, that it could hardly have
been thought that so many men were in the Land: and at this appearance of the
English the forreiners vanish and are dispersed, being terrified to hear the
English were so unanimous in the defense of their Country and its freedom; Oh
were we but thus united now within our selves we need never fear the
combination of forreiners.

But these noble souls being more valiant than wary, more pitiful than just,
upon a few feigned shows of amendment, and fawning promises of not entrenching
upon their liberties, receive the Snake into their bosoms, which will reward
their kindness with their ruin as soon as he is able.

For in the Parliament assembled at London, the cry of blood and oppression
being stopped and smothered up, 49. Year.
Henry again is seated on the Throne, upon that poor and Threadbare
satisfaction of himself and his son, taking their Oaths to confirm the
Charters and Statutes before at Oxford, and those now newly made: sure Mercury
was ascendent at Henry's nativity, so potent were his stars in deluding those
who had been so often mocked, and beguiled before; when in reason we might
suppose his former frequent violations and reiterated perjuries should have
taught them what trust was to be given to a Kings oath, in whose eye Tyrranny
was so beautiful, that he never dallied to make market both of soul and body,
so he might but purchase his desired Paramour.

These oaths being past in order to the performance after the royal mode, the
Earl of Gloucester is tampred with to leave the Barons; and by the artifice of
those masters in the art of Division, who in all times knew how to work upon
the covetous, ambitious and envious humors of great men, drawn to desert the
cause of liberty: and of this we our selves have had a sad and fatal
experience, how many great ones were cajold by Charles at Newcastle, Hol^bie
and the Islle of Wight, even to the great danger of our Cause; nay the very
House was not free, as those Tuesday nights votes may, and the Fridayes had
informed us with a witness had not Providence wrought miraculously for us, for
it can be made out by good witness that there was a resolution to have
dissolved the Parliament, and proclaimed the Army Traitors, had they all met.

But Gold was too drossie to make Glocesters towering soul stoop, and his free
spirit could not be shackled with silver fetters, some other Lure must be used
to bring him down: and now Leicester was mounted to so high a pitch in the
peoples favor, that Glocesters weaker wings could not reach him, which whilst
with an aspiring eye he gazes after, his sight was so dazzled with the others
motion us gave check to his pursuit of the game. The crafty Prince marking his
advantage, so works upon the weakness of this young Lord, that by it he
effects what he could not do by his own force; thus Diamonds are cut by their
own dust, and the Champion of Englands liberty must be the man can ruin it:
accursed be that sorceresse envy, so fatal then to Englands freedom, so
mischievous lately to the same, whose menacing power had it not been stopped by
the new model, had totally routed the Parliaments whole force, so many
Divisions of them being charged through, and through, and needs must that Army
become a Chaos, wherein Commanders consist of jarring Principles.

Gloucester now being come to his fist, away flies Edward to the Lord Mortimer,
notwithstanding his assurance given not to depart the Court: that fable of the
wise men of Gotams hedging in the cuckoo, hits many of our ancestors home, who
with oaths and promises went about to keep in their Kings, when one of the
Norman brood could fly over such a fence with the very shell upon his head:
and as the first part of that story may be applied to us, so the second is not
altogether insignificant for our Kings, whom we shall always find (together
with such as sing after them) in one tune, crying out disloyal, dissoyall, as
if they could say as well as do nothing else: yet a Christian may conceive such
a found should make them tremble, by bringing the sins of their fathers and
their own iniquities into their remembrance, did they but believe there were a
God, who will measure the same measure out unto them which they have meted to
others, and will visit the sins of the fathers upon the children.

Gloucester and Edward having done the Prologue, the Tragedy begins, wherein the
Scenes were so well laid, that every actor was ready to enter, and each had his
part so well by heart, that it is plain they had been long conning their
lessons; for no sooner were these two gone, but the Earls, Warren, Pembroke,
with a whole shoale of Poictovins, and other strangers, come to land in Wales,
which with the scattered relics of the battle at Jews, gathered from all
parts, embody in great numbers before the Lords who stood faithful were aware
of them, yet they prepare for them as fast as they can: but their fortune was
now in the wane, their pity and credulity had brought them into the snare, and
their lives must go for suffering him to escape whom God had delivered into
their hands: for to condemn the innocent and absolve the guilty, are equally
abominable in the sight of heaven: and our ancestors to their cost have made
experience of the truth of the Proverb, Save a thief from the Gallows, and he
shall be the first will cut your throat.

First the Armies meet at Killingworth, where the Lord Simon Montford son to
the Earl of Leicester is defeated; this bad news meeting Leicester in Wales
hastens him to repair the breach made in their fortunes, and he meets the enemy
near Evesham, where in a bloody field fighting most valiantly, he loses life
and victory both, and with him many more of the most noble English fall a
victime to perjured Tyranny, whose rational and undaunted souls disdaininga
Brutish slavery, freely offered up their bodies on the High places of the
field, a rich oblation for Englands freedom, which together expired, and lay
butchered by them.

The loss of this battle was imputed to the cowardice of the Welsh, who in
great numbers ran away in the beginning of the fight, not to the injustice of
the cause, of which the people had a sacred opinion: but the truth is, there
was an accursed thing, an Achan in Leicesters host, old Henry attended with
whole troops of perjuries, matters, and oppressions, against whom incensed
heaven was injustice engaged.

And now that the world might take notice Tyranny was again in the saddle,
cruelty in the height of revenge pranceth through the field; for the dead body
of noble Leicester was most barbarously abused and cut in pieces, the head with
the privy members fastened on either side the nose being sent as a Trophy to
the Lord Roger Mortimers wife, a present indeed as fitting for a Lady to
receive, as it was becoming a Prince, who was Leicesters nephew to send, but
the people made a Saint of him whom his enemies by making relics of, rendered
themselves little better than Devils, and the dismembered body gave a fragrant
sent, whilst the dismemberers rotted and stank alive, thus after death
Leicester leads a triumph over Tyranny, which may instruct us how far a free
and generous soul is above its reach.

And here notwithstanding the calumnies and reproaches wherewith the Royal
party backed with success, and parasiticall Chronologers then and since have
loaded Leicester; yet we may take a guess of the worth of that noble Lord by
the love of the people, and malice of the Tyrant: the former cannonizing him
for a Saint, do what the latter could for his heart: and sure the common people
had more than ordinary cause, which could make them practice after an unusual
manner, which was to judge contrary to event: had his pride and his sons
insolency been such as some would make them (who endeavor with their shame to
make a cloak for their adversaries knaverie) Henry need never to have been so
timorous as he was, who not only confessed he feared the father more than any
storm, but could never be quiet until he ezpell'd both mother and sons the
Land, though she was his sister, a Lady of eminent note, both daughter and
sister to a King, and they upon delivering up their strengths were seemingly
received into favor: thus dreadful and hateful to a tyrant are free and
generous spirits, which must expect such usuage, when they are within the verge
of his power, and such effects of an act of oblivion must our noble Patriots
have felt from Charles, had not providence in men been pleased to have put
bounds to the parallel, by erecting us a pillar with a ne plus ultra upon it.

Let each following line then teach here thankfulness to Heaven, wherein we
shall read, from what a labyrinth and maze of misery divine mercy has freed
our unworthy selves; in which our forefathers were miserably imprisoned and
devoured: and let us prize the clue which has led us out among our choicest
jewels; that giving glory to the hand, and honor to the instrument, we may in
some measure walk worthy of the mercies we have received.

Henry now again where he would be, breaths nothing but blood, and revenge
against all who had stood for liberty, following, and pursuing them with such
unheard of fury, that had not some potent favorites interposed, he had burnt
the whole City of London: Thus the Metropolis of England had been laid in
ashes, which so generously and often has ventured for Liberty, had not God had
a work to do, wherein London was to be gloriously isntrumental, and so
delivered it out of the paw of the Lion.

A Parliament now is summoned to Winchester (which considering the season, was
likely to do the people much good) and in this all who took part with the Lords
are disherited, all the Statutes of Oxford are repealed, the wealthiest
Citizens of London cast into prison, the City deprived of it is Liberties, and
all the posts and chains taken away; These things being put in execution (for
such Acts must be kept) another Parliament meets at Westminster, wherein the
Acts of Winchester are confirmed; Thus topsie turvie is the world changed,
that Assembly, the only refuge and Assilum for the people to fly to, and so
lately the assertor of their Freedoms is become the Mint, wherein the Tyrant
stamps for current what he lists, and makes the basest metal pass for Gold,
backing his lust with pretense of Law: O now I warrant you Henrye's conscience
is tender in keeping Acts of Parliament, and it is no less than a piaculum to
go about to infringe them.

Henry in this latter coming to Westminster, 50. Year.
to show his goodness and bounty, freely bestows on his Hang-bies sixty
Citizens houses, together with their furniture, and all the lands, goods and
chattels belonging to their owners; Yet at length he was pleased to pardon the
City upon the payment of twenty thousand marks, and giving Hostages of the best
men's Sons, to be kept in the Tower at their Parents charges.

Business thus dispatched at London, away hies Henry to Northampton, where the
Popes Legate holding a Synod, curses all those who stood for Liberty: and Henry
had been undutifull had he not helped his Holy-Father, who all along had bin so
kind to him, he good man was agreed with before, it was all the reason then in
the World that the Pope should make his market; thus the poor slaves were to
purchase their fetters double, so costly was slavery unto England; justly then
may such be termed niggards and base, who will grumble now though with a round
sum to purchase their Liberty. And now it seems Henry made not his journey for
nothing, for the grateful Pope by his Legate this Synod, grants the tenths of
the Church for a year unto him, so bountiful in rewarding one another were
these Foxes, with what they lurched from the Geese.

51. Year.
Henry passing his time in such pranks as these, at last Gloucester finding his
turning not to serve his tongue as he expected, takes his time, changes his
footing, and assembling an Army seizes on London: this puts the King and Legate
so to their trumps, as brought both unto their last stake, making the one pawn
the shrines, jewels, and relics, the other spend the curses and
excommunications of the Church most liberally; but the Legate might have been
sent packing with his Son at his back in Pontificalibus, had not Henry's
Golden Gods wrought the miracle, which having thousands of Angels at command,
quickly brought in great Armies of Forraigners, by whose aid Gloucester was
forced to submit, he and all his partakers fining for their offense to Henry,
who, no doubt, made them pay for putting him into such a fear, as well as unto
such a charge, (which could be no small sum, were he like some of his late
successors in defraying only the charges laid out for gilded clouts) besides
what must be given to set the little Dagons in their places again, and appease
their and their Priests fury: Thus Gloucester received the reward of his base
deserting Leicester, being forced by his kind Master to find sureties for his
good behavior.

And now this Earl being brought under the yoke, Henry turns against those
Barons who stood out, and were possessed of the Isle of Elie. These he first
attempts by the Legate (his forlorn Hope and reserve too it seems) who is
beaten back with this repulse, That unles the Statutes of Oxford might be
observed, and Hostages delivered, that they might peaceably enjoy the Island,
until they should perceive how the King would perform his promises, they were
resolved to stand it out, and with the venture of their bodies seek to preserve
their Souls, upon which lay most sacred and solemn ties. So great an
encouragement was the opinion of their cause, that it made them stand upright
and undaunted after all these storms; and so great a distrust had Henry's
perfidie created, that his subjects durst not let him come within their swords
point, without Hostage given to keep him to his word; and indeed this Tyrants
gain by their violations, that none dare believe them but will rather fight it
out to the last, as expecting revengefull and treacherous usage from them.

This Answer to the Legate so netled Henry, that he could not choose but wince;
and well it might, for his galled conscience could not endure the mention of
keeping an Oath, which was a tacit exprobration of him, no more than his
tyrannical humor could of the Oxford Articles, which carried in them a sound
of Liberty, a thing he supposed he had by the sword ripped out of English breasts.

And no doubt but it must be thought great incivility in these Barons to dare
to believe their eyes before royal perjuries, and great sauciness in them, to
make, or pretend to make more conscience of Oaths then their King; for what
was this other than to endeavor to appear more religious, more honest, more
true, and more just than their sacred Sovereign? Away with such precise, and
puritannicall fellows; there can never be a good world so long as such are
suffered to go unpunished; into the High Commission Court with these
Sectaries, that the Legate may hamper them; bring these seditious fellows
before the King, and the Honorable privy Council, that they may receive the
reward of their presumptuous questioning the legality of obeying King and
Cardinal, right or wrong; nay, what is more, they are not contented to be
slaves as others are, let them be tried for Traitors and Rebels, for they
have taken up Arms against the King, and talk of defending their Liberties by
the Sword; Thus rang the peale among the flattering Courtiers, and the like
verdict has been past upon us by the Royal jury men, who in all things have
followed these their foremen. Here we may perceive then through the veil of
pretended Protestantisme, and Conscience, the rrue rise of the Royalists
assertions, for the Parasiticall Papist has done the like, to whom the
reformed Religion was unknown or abhorred, flattery being the motive, not
Conscience, the desire to cologue with a Tyrant, not the fear of displeasing
God.

And upon these worthy considerations Henry and his faction decree ruin to
these Barons, and the fate of Liberty was unable to resist their vows; for
Prine Edward with a great Army quickly forces them out of their strengths in
that Isle whose courage was greater than their force, and their resolutions
more numerous than their party; thus were the last glimmerings of Freedom
extinguished, and the whole Land envolved in darkness, the English being left
to grope in a blind obedience after the will of their Tyrannical Master. 52.
Year


Henry by treachery having thus triumphed over liberty, He convenes a
Parliament at Marlborough, where in a flourish he confirms the great Charter,
either on purpose to make their teeth water, or to quiet the grumblings on foot
against his Tyranny, by this act of grace, which was likely to be kept now the
Bugbears of prerogative, those resolute Lords and Gentlemen were destroyed.

Now twentieths, and fifteenths, or what ever he would demand are readily
granted, and glad he would be so contented, and all things go as well as Henry
can wish, who promises to be a good Lord to them, so long as they shall
continue humble vassals, contented slaves unto him; no mumbling or talking must
be of Oxford Acts, which it was high treason but to think on, so wise the world
was now grown over those former mad Parliaments.

And thus after he had at least twenty times confirmed, and as often violated
those just decrees, notwithstanding all the solemnities, both civil, moral,
and ecclesiastical, used in the acts of ratification, and after all the hard
strivings, and wrastlings between tyranny, and liberty, with such bad success
to the people, whose foolish credulity and sinful pity undid them, in the
seven and fiftyeth year of his reign Henry and Magna Charta slept together,
his Son Edward succeeding him in his Tyranny, to which he was Heir, as to
the Crown; for he made an higher improvement of his royalty, and got the
domination of this State in so high and eminent manner, that (as one says) he
seemed to be the first Conquerout after the Conqueror, his little finger was
heaviour than his Fathers loins, laying insupportable taxes on both Clergy and
Laity even unto the half of their Estates, the Barons and people not daring to
quitch, or move for removal of grievances, until at last needing a vast Sum
to maintain his Wars, he Summoned a Parliament, wherein he was pleased to
confirm the Charters to stop their mouths and open their purses, and this he
often did when his occasions urged him to it, which like all other royal
promisers he performed by leisure; Never was Royalty more Majestic, and
glorious than in this Kings Reign, and the people less able to oppose; but I
shall conclude his Character with what DANIEL says of him, he was more for the
greatness of the Kingdom than the quiet of it; for having been nursed up* in
slaughter, he as it were thirsted after blood, so that never any King before or
since (except our last Charles) shed, and caused so much to be spilt in the age
following within this Isle of Britain.

But all that we shall observe from his Reign is this, that as it was said of
the Emperor Frederick He was a good Emperor, but a bad Man, so the most
warlike, politic, and temperate Princes have been the greatest Tyrants and
oppressors of the people, the vicious and debauched by their lewd lives and
unmartiall natures, giving the people more advantage and better opportunity to
regain and revive the claim of their liberties, which the other by oraft,
force, and a kind of respect created by their morality kept them from: needs
then must that trust of power be dangerous to the Nation which lighting upon the
most able person proves most destructive to the peoples just and native
freedom.

Thus having briefly represented the most signal and material passages
throughout this tedious and long reign of Henry the third, in this short
Discourse, where as in a perspective the Reader may not only descry actions
far distant in time, and near hand, as done in our days, but also take an
exact view of the whole mannagement of affairs under the Norman Monarchy,
together with the real ground and rise of all those former, and these latter
contestations between the Kings and people of this Nation, upon the score of
Prerogative, and liberty. I shall forbear to swell into a volumne by raising
unnecessary observations, which I shall leave (as I have done the parallel,
where it was plain to every eye) to be spun out by each Readers fancy, being
assured that the most shuttleheaded adorer of our Monarchy must blush in
affirming that a fine piece, which it appears has been wrought of such course
threads and will only in short set before you those Tyrannical, abusive, and
delusive practices by which our ancestors have been bobbed, of their Freedom;
and the Norman Tyranny founded and continued over them.

William the Norman surnamed the Bastard, taking the opportunity of the
Divisions among the English, invades the Land, and overthrows Harolds, weakened
much in a fight with the invading Norwegians, where though he got the victory,
he lost the bodies of many, and the hearts of most of his Soldiers by his
partial dividing of the Spoil.

Harold slain, and William victorious he is received, and crowned King by
consent of the English, upon taking his oath to maintain the ancient Laws and
liberties of the Nation. And now being as the thought settled in the Throne, he
begins to play Rex, in English the Tyrant, spoiling the English of their
estates, which they were forced to purchase again of him, who nevertheless
retained a propriety in them, and would have all held of himself as Landlord:
thus came in the slavish Tenures, and the English, amongst whom were no bondmen
before, both Nobility and Commons, were made subject to the intolerable
servitude of the Norman.

The English thus exasperated take up arms to regain their liberty, and that so
unanimously; under the conduct of Edgar Etheling, then termed Englands
Darling, and Edwin and Morchar Earls of Mercia and Northumberland, that the
tyrant not daring to fight them, assayes to pacify them by large promises of
addressing their grievances, and restoring their liberties, and by the help of
some Clergy men he so prevails, that meeting at Berkhamsted an accord is made,
William taking his personal oath upon the Relics of the Church of Saint
Alhans, and the holy Evangelists, from thenceforth to observe inviolably the
ancient Laws, especially those of Saint Edward, whom the Norman wickedness
had sainted among the people, so transcendent was tyranny already grown.

The English deceived by these specious shows lay down their arms, and repair
to their homes, and now William having obtained his end, takes his advantage,
and sets upon them dispersed, and never dreaming of any assault, imprisoning,
killing, banishing all he could lay hands on, and forcing the rest to fly into
Scotland, overthrowing their ancient Laws, and introducing others in a strange
language, appropriating the old Forests, and making new ones, by depopulating
the Country, and pulling down Churches, Abbeys, and Houses for thirty miles
together, and yet prohibiting the people the liberty of hunting upon great
penalties, the ancicient privilege and delight of the English: thus by
treachery and perjury cheating the English of their liberties, whom by force he
could not bring under his yoke, he laid the foundation upon which his
Successors have erected the stately trophies of Tyranny amongst us.

But the English being of a generous and free nature were so impatient of the
yoke, that upon all opportunities they did endeavor to break it; whereupon our
Kings were forced still to make use of other props to uphold their tottering
edifice, which perjury alone was too rotten to sustain, and by the Pope,
Prelates, and Lords, working upon the credulous, superstitious, and unstable
vulgar, did even to admiration shore up their Babel to the confusion of liberty.

1. The Pope was the chief Hobgob in in those dark times, that scared the
people out of their wits; for through the superstitious ignorance of men, he
had usurped the power of God; this Iugler with the counterfeit thunder of his
Excommunications, and curses, which his Bulls upon all occasions bellowed forth
against the assertors of Liberty, and with the pretended omnipotency of his
dispensations with the oaths of the Tyrant, so amazed the people, that he not
only domineered himself, but, like the Lord Paramount, for great Fines let the
Land out, to be harrowed, and the inhabitants to be handled like villains and
slaves to his Royal and well beloved sons (indeed he was a dear father to
most of them) our immediate Landlords.

2. The proud Prelates, the Imps of that great Diabolo of Rome, were many of
them strangers, and all of them the Creatures of the Popes, and Kings (who
would choose none, but such as were fit for their designs, by their good wills,
and with their ill wills could out any that should thwart them) and so either
regarded not our sufferings, or were bound to augment them to please their
Patrons, as well as to pamper themselves, who being Diocesan Monarchs were no
foes to Arbitrary power that themselves might tyrannize ad libitum over their
Sees.

And no doubt but Kings were so crafty as to persuade them No King, no Bishop,
heretofore, to heighten their zeal to the Royal cause, as Prelates of late have
stiffened them with No Bishop, no King, in obstinacy for Prelacy; yet these
later have been Prophets against their wills, at their fall, who in their
jollity had little or no will to be Preachers, and were so effectual in their
doctrine, that they confirmed their calling to be jure divino, though Scripture
was never so clear against it, in the Royal conscience, to whom a Crown and
Scepter must appear most sacred.

And now the Father, and Sons, the Pope and Prelates profit requiring it,
what could there be imagined, but that it must be stamped with a divine right?
alas it was easy with them to take sacred from an Oath, and confer it upon the
perjured Violater; they had their holy oil sent from Heaven by an Angel to
Thomas Becket that Metropolitan Saint, and Martyr of Canterbury, with which
Kings were anointed, and diverse other holy devices to make them sacred, not to
be touched by profane Civil Laws, or questioned by any but men in holy
orders; who being ghostly Fathers, might lash, curse, depose, and devote to the
Knife, Sword, etc. (notwithstanding Sacred, and Majesty, and holy Unction, and
all the rest) Emperors, or Kings, if stubborn, or encroaching upon the
usurpations of Holy Church.

For you may observe that clause in the Coronation Oath to maintain the rights
and privileges of Holy Church, to be indispensahle in former times as well as
these latter, wherein conscience was only made of preserving Episcopacy: Thus
one part of the Oath was not to be violated upon pain of the highest censures;
all the rest but a mere formality, and we poor Lay-slaves not to question our
Kings doings, but in a blind and brutish obedience perform all their commands,
just or unjust, good or wicked, our Clergy Impostures making the Pulpits ring
with to obey is better than sacrifice, for Rebellion is as the sin of
VVitchcraft, etc. Sacred writ being wracked to torment us, and the Scriptures
perverted to subvert our Liberties, and notwithstanding the Cheat was so
palpable, the peoples understandings were lost in the Fogge, which these Gipsy
Magicians raised by their Charms.

Behold then the reason of Episcopacies being so sacred and divine in the
judgment of Kings, who were so devoted to Tyranny that they ventured all to
maintain it.

3. The Nobility were made the Whifflers to make room for the Monarchical
Masquers: and although many of these were so generous, that they disdained to
be slaves, and so potent and valiant, that they regained their fredoms, and
brought the Tyrants on their knees, yet so ambitious and envious were the most
of them, that they were easily divided and made to ruin one another, every one
chosing rather to be a slave to a Tyrant, than be equaled by his fellow, and
gaping for advancement over the rest by his obsequiousness to his great master,
thus by envy and Court preferment; being bewitched, they still undid what they
had well done, and made the peoples taking up of arms for Liberty the step to
their own preferment, betraying them to curry favor with their oppressor.

Thus were the people still betrayed by their Leaders, and so disabled and
disheartened for the future to claim their rights by the present loss and
expense of blood and treasure: and those who faithfully stood by them severely
prosecuted and murdered; when the Tyrants though vanquished, still escaped upon
swearing a little amendment, and were set up again to take revenge upon the
peoples, and to reward and prefer their own partakers. Thus were good
patriots dishearnted and deprest, whilst that the Imps of Tyranny were
emboldened, and set aloft to the utter ruin of Englands Freedom.

Lastly, when it was apparent that the noble and free spirits of the English
could never be so deprest but that still they would up again, and so might at
last, in spite of all opposers break the yoke, with the noise of Parliaments
and Charters, Kings often stilled the Peoples cries, when indeed the former
were so stuffed with a King, Lords, and Prelates, that the peoples
Representatives sat for little more than ciphers to make up thousands and ten
thousands, when the others pleased to set the figure before them: and the
latter were of little or no use to the People, who received no benefit by them,
but stood Kings in great stead, helping them to Millions, when all other shifts
failed to get money.

And now these things premised, I appeal to the judgment of all rational
creatures, whether it be not so perspicuous that the dimmest eye, on this side
blindness, not winking our of design must perceive

1. That continual claim has been made by the English to their rights and
Liberties, so that in point of Law no pretentended succession, continued by
force, fraud, and perjury, can be a just plea to bar us of our inheritance,
our Native Freedom, which we have now gained possession of, the most high and
just judge having given sentence for us upon our appeal, and of his free grace
enabled us to enter in despite of those who so long kept possession against
our Ancestors.

2. That it would be the highest imprudencie, if not folly and madness, in us
for the future to trust the most promising and insinuating Princes with our
liberties and privileges, which can be no longer expected to be preserved by
them, than they may serve as footwools to advance them in the Throne of
absolute Tyranny.

3. That the whole frame of just Government, has been dissolved by our Norman
Lords, who have made their own proud wills the rules, and their own greatness
and absoluteness the end of their Government. Sic volo sic jubeo, was Lex
terrae, I mean the Law which was only in practice; and if this be not tyranny
let our Royalists enquire of Lipsius no small Champion of Monarchy, who makes
not the grandeur of the Court, but the Good of the Commonwealth the mark that
Princes are set up to aim at: neque enim principatus ipse finis est, absit, aut
altitudoilla and splendour, sed populi ho^um, it is not the greatness and
luster of the Prince, but the good of the people that is the end of
Principality, and that eloquent Panegyrist in his Oration in the Roman Senate
shows that the Empereall dignity consisted not in sound or show; for says he
though we adorned our Emperors with majesty and pomp, yet is there far more
due from them to us the authors and granters of their power, as to take care
of the Commonwealth, and setting aside self interest to intend the good of the
people, etc. neque enim specie tenus, as nomine fortuna Imperii consideranda
est, sunt trabeae and fasces, and stipatio, and fulgur, and quicquid aliud huic
dignitati adstruximus, sed long majora sunt qua vicissim nobis auctoribus,
fautoribusque potentiae debent, admittere in animum totius Reipublicae curam,
and oblitum quodammodo sui Geniibus vivere, etc. Yet thus to have taught his
duty and the peoples sovereign power had been little less than treason with
one of our Monarchs, which a Roman Emperor disdained not to hear in the open
Senate, though he was accounted a more absolute Lord by far than one of our
Kings, and we were entitled to more liberty than the Romans.

But to conclude, so great corruption has invaded Monarchy in general; and so
universally is it fallen from its primitive purity, that it is most evident its
fate is not far off, quin ruet sua mole, and will be buried in its own
rubbish, for there are Symptoms by which the dissolution of politic bodies
may be guessed at as well as natural, and too much surfeiting will bring both
into the dust.

And let us omit the tyrannies, murders, and idolatries, and take a view but of
the perfidies, and perjuries, the main pieces of King craft, by which Monarchs
have carried on their Designs a long while in the world, and we may without a
spirit of prophecy foretell what is likely to befall Royal families even by
the light of nature, and a common observation of providence, for a very heathen
Poet tells us, (...)
(...);
(...),
(...),
(...).


That though God may for a while defer his Judgment against the violator of
his oath and promise, yet h^mself, wife and children shall dearly pay for it at
last; an oraculous truth* and confirmed in our eyes, and which may deter all
of us who are on this side sorcery or obduration, from during t^ engage against
heaven, and oppose the Almighty in the execution of Justice upon an offending
family, by which we shall only draw down vengeance upon our own heads to the
eternal confusion of both souls and bodies, for great is Jehovah, and only to
be feared, and there is none can deliver out of his hand.

FINIS.
