THE Whirlwind of the Lord gone forth AS A Fiery flying Roll, WITH An Alarm
sounded against the Inhabitants of the North-Countrey.

Being a Fore-warning to all the Rulers in England, of the mighty and terrible
day of the Lord, which shall overtake the wicked; but especially and in
particular, to the persecuting Rulers, Priests, and people, in the County of
Westmerland.

Who by their fruits are made manifest to all, to be open enemies to Sions
Converts, and a Generation of evil doers, with whom the Lord Jehovah is coming
to plead the cause of the oppressed, and to redeem Zion with judgment, and her
Converts with righteousness.

For behold, the Lord will come with fire, and his Chariots like a whirlwind,
to vende^ his anger with fury, and his rebukes with flames of fire: for by
fire, and by his Sword will the Lord plead with all flesh, and the slain of the
Lord shall be many, Isa. 66.15.26. And I will punish the world for their evil,
and the wicked for their Iniquity, and I will cause the arrogance of the proud
to cease, and I will lay low the ha^ght^nesse of the terrible. Isa. 13.11. He
that has an ear to hear let him hear, and he that has an eye to see let him
see; for that which is determined shall come to pass. And the Decree that is
p^r^osed shall surely be performed, And nothing of the Vision shall fail, till
all shall be fulfilled: he that can receive, let him. G. T.

THE Whirlwind of the Lord gone forth as a fiery flying Roll.
TO all ye Rulers and Governors, Priest and people, who are turned from the
light wherewith Christ Jesus has enlightened you, and are found persecuting
those who dwell in the light, who are moved of the Lord to declare against you,
all who hate the light, whose deeds are evil, who dare not bring your deeds to
the light, least it should reprove them: there is thy condemnation the light,
the light which never changes: thou that live in wickedness, turning to the
light, it will reprove thee, thou who art proud turning to the light it will
reprove thee; there thou have learned thy condemnation, the light, the light
that is placed in thy heart, the eternal light, thou that turnest from this
light, art turned from God, and art a Child of darkness, and art in the broad
way, and the condemnation of the Devil, thou hate the light, and dare not
bring thy deeds to it, because thou knows they are evil, thou art a corrupt
Tree, and bring forth evil fruia and art to be cut down and cast into the
fire, thou cumbers the ground of the Lord, whose deeds are evil, thou art an
unprofitable Servant, and hides the Lords Talent in the earth, thou devoures
the Creatures of God, and spends them upon thy lust, which the Lord has
created to be used in fear and moderation, to his praise and glory: therefore
must thou give an account before the living God, who is Lord of Heaven and
Earth, who made all things good, to be ordered in his eternal wisdom to his
glory, which is received in the light, but thou who art turned from the light,
art out of order, and spends the creatures upon thy lust: the light leads to
God the Father, from lust, he that lusts eats, and is fallen under the
condemnation; In that day thou eat, faith God, thou shall die: so thou that
have eaten, and art turned from the light, art in the death, and free from the
life of God, and the light is thy condemnation, if thou turn into it, it will
show thee where thou art: thou drunkard turn into the light, that thou may
see thy self, and come to repentances thou liar and swearer, turn into the
light, that it may reprove thee, thou slanderer and false accuser, thou
persecuter, railer and scorner, thou who live in envy, who art in Cains way,
who hates the light. Thou covetout oppressor, who grindes the faces of the
poor, thou perverter of justice, who art in the way of proud Haman. Tee outside
professors, who have the form without the power of godliness: ye deceivers, who
are in the steps of the false Prophets, which the true Prophets of the Lord
cried woe against, who seek for your gain from your quarter, greedy dumb dogs,
which can never have enough, who teach for the wool and fleece, and prepare
war against those who put not into your mouths, who are greedy of filthy
lucre, who are in the steps of the Scribes and Pharisees, Christ Jesus cried
woe against, who hate the light, and with it are to be condemned from all the
Children of the light, who love the light, and walk in the light, and to him
there is no occasion of stumbling; but he receives the light of life, the light
is the condemnation of the world, which is set in man's heart, there the world
is placed; who art turned from the light, thy heart is in the earth, and there
is no room for God there; thou bear the earthly Image, which is sin and
death; for the life of God thou knows nor, whose life is carnal, the pare
Image thou bear not, where righteousness dwells, where peace and joy is,
where pure Religion is, where liberty is, where is riches and pleasures, where
the mouth cannot come to corrupt, nor thieves break thorough and steal: this
treasure is hid in earthen vessels; but the Lord will not dwell with a Cage of
unclean birds, where the heart is not purified through the faith of Christ: the
mystery whereof, is held in a pure conscience, where the unclean enters not,
but is shut out with the light that comes from the Lord Jesus: who are Children
of the light live in righteousness, and are the Servants of God, and have an
everlasting reward, who turn from the light of the Lord Jesus, are turned from
God, and from the faith of Christ, and from the pure Conscience, whose
consciences are seared, and speak lies in hypocrisy, and cry, Lord, Lord, and
profess the name of God and Christ, whole hearts are full of rottenness,
covetousness, pride and oppression, all which are condemned with the light, and
all that profession professed in that nature, and all that sacrifice is
abomination to the Lord: the light searches and tries, bring all your works
to the light, to try them whether they be wrought in God, for every one shall
be rewarded according to his works, whether they be good or evil. To the light
in all consciences I speak, that with it you may see your selves and come to
repentance, or else it will be your condemnation: this is the way to life, the
light which never changes, this is the voice of Christ Jesus, which calls for
holiness and purity, from sin and uncleanness, all that turn to the light, and
love the light, they love God and Christ, from whence the light comes, and are
led and guided by it, in the way of righteousness, and from under the
condemnation; but thou that hate the light, and walks contrary to the light,
with the light art judged and condemned from all the Children of light, and thy
practice and profession is abomination to the Lord, though thou make a large
profession of the name of God and Christ, and the Saints words and practice,
yet thou art without the life, without God in the world, out of the Cross of
Christ Jesus which crucifieth the flesh with its affections and lusts, thou art
covered with thy own self-righteousnesse, and art ignorant of the
righteousness of Christ Jesus, and therefore thy work will burn and be
consumed in the day of the Lord God Almighty which is nigh at hand, in which
day must every man's work be tried, for the day will declare it, and God is pure
and holy, and holiness becomes his house for ever, thou that live in pride
and pleasures, and makes a profession of God and godliness, thy work will
burn, thou that I vest in lust and uncleanness and art covered with a
profession of godliness, thy profession is for the fire, there to be tried and
consumed, thou who art coveting after earthly things honors and dignities, and
shroudest thy self under the figlease-garment of self-righteousnesse and
seeming godliness, the Lord searches the heart, and tries the reins, and
judges not as man judges, who knows all things: that is done in secret he
sees, and thou can not hide thy self from him, but he will search thee and
try thee, and see what is in thy heart, thou who have made a profession of his
Name, must come forth and confess to thy nakedness before the living God,
priest and people, professor and profane, now is the light arisen to try you,
and search you: therefore come to the light to be tried and judged, whether thy
works be wrought in God or no, ye high professors, and high priests, who are
high in the Notion, come down to the light, to try your works and life, thou
who live in thy lust, and yet make a profession of purity, thou art an
hypocrite, and got above the Cross of Christ Jesus, who live in the high
conceits, in the proud uncrucified fleshly mind, thou art such as Christ Jesus
cried woe against, who were large in the profession as thou art, in the high
Notion, got above the light, who said and did not, and laid heavy burdens upon
others, and they themselves would not touch them with one of their fingers,
thou art a these and a robber who climbest above the door, which is Christ
the light, into the profession without the life. Christ is the way and reveals
the Father of lights, who walk in the light walk not in darkness, who walk not
in the light walk in darkness, and know not whither they go, where schism,
strife and contention is, where the many ways is, lo here and lo there, as
Christ foretold, but the light is but one and leads into unity and love, all
that love it and walk in it, to the life which is but one, where all are of one
heart and one mind, the pure mind, who obey the light which calls for purity,
this light leads out of the Fall up to God and Christ from whence it comes,
all that obey it, out of the Fall through the Cross and death, into the
beginning before the Fall, to the word of God, by which were all things made,
and by which they stand, where the stedfastness and standing is unmovable upon
the Rock, where the power of death cannot enter, not the gates of hell cannot
prevail, which is over the world, and comprehends the world, with all its
glories, where the eternal life is, where peace and rest is, joy and gladness,
rivers of pleasures, and fullness of joy for ever, Oh rejoice ye Children of
the light, who love the light, and walk in the light, shine forth as lights, in
your words and works, in the midst of a crooked and deceitful generation, the
arm of the Lord is with you, which he is now stretching over the Nations, his
right arm shall bring salvation, his power is over all and above all, which
binds down all, that nothing can pass its limits and bounds, which are set by
the unlimited power of God, before which power must all knees bow, and all
tongues confess, before which power must all strong Oaks bow and tall Cedars,
which power will blast and consume in a moment, all the glory of this world,
which power will dash in pieces the ungodly like a potters vessel, which power
shakes heaven and earth, and makes the strong man bow himself, which is
derrible and dreadful to the wicked, which power will be stretched out against
the wicked in this day of his power, to destroy them, and hew them down by the
arm of his power, his sword is now drawn, and the power of the Lord begins to
be terrible to the Nations, the sound of the Almighty is gone forth, it is very
terrible, the sound of his power is very dreadful and terrible, the Trumpet is
sounding out of Sion, the great Alarm is already begun, and the Inhabitants
of the earth begin to fear and tremble, the sinners in Sion begin to be
afraid, and fearefullnesse to surprise the hypocrite, the battle is begun, the
great day of the Lord wherein he is arisen in power to scatter the wicked and
ungodly in their imaginations, and to throw down the Kingdom of Antichrist,
his two edged sword is drawn, it is fourbished for a mighty slaughter and the
bitter day of howling and lamentation is at hand, to come upon the wicked
persecutors, vain professors, swearers, drunkards, whoremongers, covetous
persons the high and lofty, and all the wicked of what sort, profession, or
degree soever, the terrible day of the Lord is at hand, which will burn as an
oven, and the proud, and the wicked must be cast out into utter darkness where
will be bitter weeping and gnashing of teeth for ever; when all covers of vain
professions will be too narrow to cover you with, from the sight and presence
of God, and all your wickedness will be laid open before the true judge of
heaven and earth, and every one must be rewarded according to his work: oh all
ye powers of the earth whose sword should be a terror to the evil doers, and
for the praise of them that do well, hear the word of the Lord and fear
before his power, which is now arisen, which is the higher power, unto which
our souls are subject, therefore in obedience to the command of God do we
declare against sin, where in the light of God we see it, and are sent of the
living God to declare against it, openly in the gate without respect of
persons, for he that respects persons commits sin, and is convinced by the
law of God to be in the transgression and out of the faith of Christ which is
not had with respect of persons: beware what ye do, and how you lay your sword
upon the Children of the light, who love the light and walk in the light:
beware how you account these offenders, who are sent forth in the name and
power of the Lord to declare against sin and sinners, and against all false
worships, way, and work; and to declare against the deceivers, Antichrists and
false teachers; and are sent to call people to repentance and the fear of the
living God, and to turn them from darkness to the light; your sword should be
for the praise of such, and they should have encouragement from you, in
laboring in the work of the Lord, who abide in the doctrine of Christ, and do
declare the day of the Lord which is at hand to overtake the wicked and
ungod^y, who by them are prisoned, stoned, and shamefully entreated, upon such
you ought to lay your sword, and not upon the righteous, therefore hear the
word of the Lord oh ye persecutors of the servants of the living God, and here
in the presence of the living God I clear my concience, and give you warning
as I am commanded, that in the day of the Lord God, you may all be left without
excuse, and the Lord God may be clear when he comes to judgment, and justified
in his judgments: thus fait the Lord, woe unto the wicked, and those who
per^ecute my servants, whom I send out in my name, to declare my word and
message to turn people from darkness to the light, that with the light they may
see themselves and come to repentance; woe, woe, woe, unto you says the spirit of
the living God better you had never been borne, but that a Mistone were hanged
about your necks and you thrown into the Sea, the terrible power of God is
ari^en his word is drawn to ew you down, and give you your portion in the
lake that shall never be quenched, then shall ye seek repentance when it will
be too late, and wish the Rocks and Hills might fall upon you, to cover you
from the dreadful presence of God, before the etenall fury and indignation of
the living God: who is able to abide, who is everlasting burnings and a
consuming fire: turn in to the light, and see where ye are, and how you stand
in the sight of God who will render his fury and indignation in flames of fire
upon the wicked, then will it be a day of bitter howling to you, who fight
against God and persecute his servants, then must you bow under the mighty
power of the Lord, then your Crown of pride will wither and be turned to dust,
and you will have no power nor strength to help your selves, but you will be
numbered amongst the slain of the Lord, in this day of his power, wherein the
Lord is arisen, to plead with all flesh by fire and sword, and to get himself a
name above every name, and to exalt his King, his son Christ Jesus, who is
begun to reign, and take the Kingdom which shall have no end, where
righteousness shall run down the streets as a river, who will rule the Nations
with a rod of Iron, and dash the heathen and all the proud persecutors of the
righteous seed in pieces like a potters vessel, and the servants of the Lord
shall be glad and rejoice and praise the Lord for ever, and shall have an
everlasting reward, yea blessed are they that fear the Lord, and abide
faithful to the death, the Lord shall be unto them an everlasting reward: oh
rejoice and be glad and lift up your heads you faithful ones, you dear
servants of the living God, lift up your heads and rejoice and be valiant for
the everlasting truth, for truly friends and brethren, the present sufferings
are not to be reckoned to the glory that shall be revealed in us, as we abide
faithful: Oh dear friends be encouraged, and quit your selves like men in the
work of the Lord, the power of the Lord is with you, oh rejoice, the Lord is
your God, be faithful and valiant, your reward is with you, who are faithful,
and you shall be Crowned with glory and honor for ever: let us rejoice in the
Lord, and be glad in the sight of the heathen, who fret and vex because the
righteous seed will not bow to their pride, nor submit to their wills, but
choose rather to suffer affliction with the dear servants of the living God,
then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. You who should be Ministers of
justice, and should lay your sword upon the unrighteous, and not upon those who
dwell in the tender fear of God, I am moved of the Lord to give some of you
warning in particular, and clear my conscience of you in the sight of God, in
love to your souls, that you may be left without excuse, and that you and the
rest of the wicked and ungodly, and the persecutors of what sort soever, priest
and people, all of you in general, and you who are after named in particular
within this County of Westmorland, that you are warned from the word of the
living God, and that you may remember that you have been often warned in your
life time, and here in the sight of God, I clear my conscience of you all in
giving you once more warning and every of you within this County of
Westmorland, you who are called Justices or gentlemen, high and low, and all
you priests and blind guides, to you I declare it in the presence of the living
God, as I am commanded of him, that you are mutherers of souls, and all the
blood of sarted souls under your dead ministry, will be required at your
hands: and to you people I clear my concience, in the sight of God, you are
now warned, I do declare it to you all in the presence of the Lord that the
light wherewith Christ Jesus has enlightened you, which if you turn in to it,
there is your only true teacher, and way to life, and will be your
condemnation going on to disobey it, and here I am in the sight of God clear
of a^^ your blood, in giving you all and every of you from the highest to the
lowest warning, that you repent and return to the Lord speedily, least the
Lord hasten his judgments upon you, herein I am clear of your blood if ye
perish your blood be upon your own heads for ever: Thomas Burton of Branton in
Westmorland near Appleby, called Justice, by whom I was committed to prison,
and here have remained under cruel sufferings and inhumane usage above one
whole year imprisoned, for speaking the word of the Lord to thy priest in the
steeple house yard, as I was commanded of the living God, which was the breach
of no known law of this Nation. Thou bloody persecutor of the servants of the
living God, who did likewise commit to prison the dear servants of the
living God, who are dear and faithful witnesses to the eternal truth of God,
against all the serpents brood, in whose mouth is no guile found: oh woe unto
thee, better thy mothers womb had been thy grave, except thou speedily
repent, turn in thy mind to the light to see thy pride, and haughtiness of
thy heart; with It see thy self and repent, least the heavy and fearful
judgments of God fall upon thee, under which thou can not stand, but must be
broken in pieces. I do here in the pre^ence of the living God clear my
conscience, and give you the last warning, all of you who have had a hand in
persecuting the servants of the Lord, within this County of Westmoreland, and I
give some of you warning in particular, John Archer, called Justice; James
Cook, late Major of Kendall, Edward Nevison of Nuby-stones; Thomas Gabetis
called Sheriff; Francis Higginson, priest of Kirbystaven, who did say there
was not an eternal light in thee, and that there was nothing eternal in man,
thou have manifested thy self to be a carnal brute; who have denied the Lord
that bought thee, and art a Reprobate out of thy own mouth, and said Christ was
in heaven with a carnal body: thou shameless Priest, who must needs be a
bloody persecutor, who knows nothing of God in thee but numbrest thy self
amongst the brute beasts that perish, and thou Priest Rowlands who art one
with Higginson, in thy blasphemy, and said the soul of man was not now
eternal; thou carnal brute, what do ye blind Priests preach to, if the
soul of man be not eternal, and if there be nothing eternal in man, and if
every man be not enlightened with an eternal light, here in the presence of
God I give you warning aforenamed, and all the rest of the persecutors, who
have strengthened the hands of the wicked against the innocent, priest and
people: you priests have been often warned from the word of the Lord, and your
deceitful practices laid open, and the people have been called from that false
worship, that you lead them in, to that worship which is in spirit and truth,
to the true and everlasting teacher, therefore are ye all left without excuse,
in giving you all warning, within this County of Westmoreland, both priest and
people, high and low, and thou Town of Applebie, here in the presence of the
Lord* I clear my conscience of thee, and do give thee warning that thou
repent and return to the fear of the Lord speedily, or else expect those woes
and judgments to come upon you, which have been denounced from the word of the
Lord by his servants, for not one title must fall to the ground: woe woe woe
unto thee Applebie, how often have thou been warned and called to repentance,
and there is not one in thee, of thine inhabitants, that fear the Lord,
therefore do I in the sight of God, clear my conscience of thee, and do
declare unto thee, that the sad and heavy judgments of God are to come upon
thee, which thou shall not escape; for it is the word of the Lord to thee: you
bloody persecuters, you raylers, swearers, cursed ^peakers liars and
slanderers, you must all perish in the lake together, except ye speedily
repent: ye Drunkards, Whoremongers and Adulterers, blasphemers, you filthy
unclean persons, who lie wallowing in your filthy lives, as the Sow lies
wallowing in the mire and dirt^ so little of the fear of God there is among
you: you people of Appleby, here in the presence of the living God, I clear my
conscience of thee, and give thee thy last warning from the Lord by me, that
when the sad, lamentable, and heavy judgments of God come upon you, you may
remember, you had warning from the word of the Lord, by one of his Servants. Oh
all ye people, who have heard the sound of the truth throughout this whole
Nation, I am moved of the living God to give you all warning, the Lord is
getting himself a name in this Nation, and raising up the Kingdom of his
beloved Son Christ Jesus, he is sending forth his Messengers and Servants in
his name and power, to call all to the light, which is the teaching of the
Lord, from all other false ways and worships, wherein they have been led,
where their souls have not been profited, where the many confused cries have
been, as lo here, and lo there, to you all I am moved to write, that you may
all be warned, as I am moved of the living God, whatsoever your profession be,
that you come out of your dead forms to the light of Christ Jesus, wherewith
you are enlightened, that with it you may see your selves, and the
deceitfulness of your hearts and ways, that you come to repentance, and the
fear of the Lord, and learn of Christ who was meek and lowly in heart, to pull
down your pride and strong conceits, and high thoughts, and vain imaginations,
and turn to the living God, that he may be honored by you, and his judgments
may be removed from you, who reject the Counsel of God, and contend quarrel and
dispute against the everlasting truth, upon which they will in the end split
themselves, and be broken in pieces: here I declare it unto you, in the
presence of the living God; and he that can receive it let him: here is your
way to life, the light, the light which changes not, the light in every ones
consciences, which checks for sin, and calls to repentance, loving this light:
here is your teacher, and obeying of it, it will lead you up to God, into
eternal rest, peace and salvation from sin and ungodliness, hating this light,
and blaspheming it, calling it natural, and acting contrary to it: here is your
condemnation, the light, take warning and repent betimes, oh all people every
where; for it is hard for you to kick against the pricks; for the mighty God is
arisen in power, not only to shake the earth, but the Heavens also, and to
create new Heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness; and to
overturn the Kingdom of Antichrist, root and branch, with its foundation and
strength, that all may come to build upon the everlasting foundation which is
already laid, Christ the light, to witness the righteousness of God in Christ
Jesus, thorough the death of selfrighteousness, all high conceits, and angry
notions, that God Almighty may be honored, and all may bow to the Scepter of
his Son, and throw down their glories at his feet, that he alone may be
honored and worshipped, and all proud flesh abased in his sight, according to
the word of the Lord, that he that glories, may glory in the Lord. Oh all
people within this County of Westmerland, and throughout the whole Nation: this
is the word of the Lord God A mighty to you, that you may be all warned, Priest
and People, you that are in forms, or got above forms, or live in the form of
truth only, without the life and power; and here is your only true teacher the
light, the light which shines into your Consciences, and if you turn into it,
and mind it, it will open your understandings, and let you seeplainly where
you are, whether you be in the broad way, or the narrow way, the light will
search you, and try you, and rip up your hearts, and will show you all your
thoughts, and every idle word, for which you must give an account before the
Lord, and if you obey it, it will be your salvation, and if you disobey it, it
will be your condemnation: the light, the light wherewith ye are enlightened,
which comes from Christ Jesus, which is the grace of God, which has appeared
to all men, the free teacher of righteousness, the everlasting light, which
never changes, in which as you turn into it, it will show you what is the will
of God and show all sin and wickedness, and all deceit, and call you from it;
and if you obey it, it will lead you into truth, and from all false worships,
to the true worship of God, which is in spirit and truth, where all deceit and
hypocrisy, will with the light be judged and condemned; and abiding in it, it
will teach you the true knowledge of God, and of his will, and in the light you
will come to comprehend the world, and the deceits and vanities that are in it,
pride and oppression, formality and hypocri^^e; and oh all people know this,
that if any fall from the light, as Judas, who betrayed innocent blood, and had
recei^ed part of the Ministry, and do crucify Gods Son afresh, and put him
to open shame, by which the great offense comes, and the way of truth comes to
be evil spoken of, all such with the light are condemned and judged, who are
departed from it, into the lust and filth; such we deny, and do testify
against openly, in the pre^ence of the living God: yea better they had never
been born, who were once enlightened, and had tasted of the good word of God,
and are fallen from the holy Commandment, into the way of perdition: offenses
will come, but woe unto them by whom they come, herein is the Scripture
fulfilled, and the falling away, that those that are approved may be made
manifest, and the steadfastness of all proved and tried: and this is no new
thing, but was ordained of old, that all may be tried and proved, and blessed
are all they that abide faithful, grounded upon the Rock, unmovable; they
shall have an everlasting reward, when Demas and Judas must go down into
perdition, and all that turn from the light, from following the Lamb, who are
not willing to part with all for Christ, who is the everlasting treasure, which
the world knows not, nor can learn by the Serpents wisdom, which is accursed
from God, and all the Serpents brood, who are in the many inventions, making
Images and forms of truth, and likenesses of pure Religion and righteousness;
but the life they know not, which is eternal, and immortal; beware of dogs,
beware of Concision; separate your selves from unrighteousness without, and
learn Christ, who is within the vail, through the death arisen and ascended far
above all principalities and powers, and has led captivity captive, and has
through death overcome him, who had the power of death, that is, the Devil, and
is set down at the right hand of God, for ever, making intercession by his
blood, whose righteousness is pure, and all are Virgins that follow the Lamb,
clothed in white linen, who are redeemed to the Lamb through his blood,
having in the greatness of his strength trodden the Winepresse of the wrath of
God and there was none to help him, without the Camp of God, where all the
persecutors of the righteous seed must be trodden in pieces, and drink of the
Cup of the Lords fury and indignation, which is to be given them without
mixture, and they must drink it, and be drunk and mad, as it is at this day: he
that can receive it let him; and be warned O all people and repent, now while
it is called to day, least the word of the Lord be fulfilled upon you, he that
has an ear to hear let him hear: here is your teacher the light, and will lead
you to God, and bring salvation, if you love it and obey it; and your
condemnation, if you disobey it: and here I have cleared my Conscience, in the
sight of God, as I was commanded, in showing thee the way to life, that you may
be all left without excuse, and God may be clear, Oh England, of thy blood, and
all his faithful Servants, who have faithfully given thee warning, thy blood be
upon thy own head if thou perish; and he that comes out of thy sins, does
deliver his soul, and come to eternal life; to the light of Christ in every one
of your Consciences. I speak which shall be my witness, and your condemnation,
that hate it, from him who to all your souls, is a friend, who is at the giving
forth of this, a prisoner in the common Goal at Appleby in Westmerland, for the
truths sake, known to the world by the name of Christopher Tailor.

Let this be scattered throughout the Nation, that England may have warning,
that the living God may be clear when he judges, and all his Servants may be
clear of his blood, who is about to raise up his Name, and spread his truth
throughout the Nations, and gather in the dispersed amongst them, that the Word
of the Lord may be fulfilled, and the Kingdoms of this world may become the
Kingdom of Christ, that there may be one Shepherd, and one fold, to the glory
and praise of his Name, who is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, God blessed
for ever, who will reign in power and glory, to the astonishment of all the
Heathen, who must be broken in pieces, and subjected under the mighty power of
God, and the Lord will reign in power, who is coming with ten thousand of his
Saints to judge the world. Oh the glory of God, the glorious reign of Sions
King, whose Scepter is everlasting, and a Scepter of righteousness, which shall
have no end, blessed and praised be the Lord, and blessed are his servants, who
behold his glory and power, which is a terror to the Nations: the shout of a
King is amongst you, clap your hands for joy, our God lives and reigns, and
is on our side, and we need not fear what man can do unto us, as we abide
faithful to him: the shout of a King is with us, glory to the Lord for ever,
ride and prosper in the name of the Lord you need no other Weapon, it is the
Lords work, ride on in power: the power of the Lord of Hoasts is with you, to
the pulling down of strong holds, and wake you a terror to your enemies: your
Weapons are not carnal, but mighty through God, the blessing of the eternal God
is with you: your honor is to bind Kings in Chains, and Nobles in Fetters of
Iron, whose Crown is not mortal, but a Crown of immortal glory: this is the
portion, and the Heritage of all his Saints, and those that fear the living
God, who take warning and repent, who love the light and walk in it, to receive
the light of life, where the blessedness is with God blessed for ever.

30. day, 5. m. (55).

THE END.
