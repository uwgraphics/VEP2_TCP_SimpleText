TO THE HONORABLE CONVENTION OF ESTATES. The humble REMONSTRANCE of the
Commissioners of the general Assembly, Concerning the Remedies of the present
dangers of Religion, July 6. 1643.
ALthough it be more easy, especially in a time of many corruptions and great
difficulties, to complain of diseases and dangers, than to find out the right
cure and remedies. Yet from our conscience of duty in the charge committed unto
us at this time, from our confidence in God, whose providence has discovered
the dangers, and will in his own time provide sufficient remedies, by the
example of the general Assemblies of this Kirk, and in obedience to your
Lordships commands: We find a necessity laid on us, and are most willing
according to our knowledge, to show what we conceive to be the best remedies,
leaving the further consideration of them to your Lordships wisdom.

Politic and worldly men are indifferently disposed toward every Religion,
and do conceive that the knowledge of a few Principles joined with the
Profession of Religion, is sufficient for salvation, without discending into
particular differences and controversies. But this cannot be a remedy; for we
know that Heresies and Sects have bin of old and must still be, that those who
are approved may be made known.

Reconcilers, who under the specious pretext of pacification betwixt
Protestants and Papists, intend no other thing, but in a subtle and crafty way
to reduce the Protestant Kirks into Antichristian servitude, and in the golden
cup of the whore of Babell to propine again unto us all the abominations and
filthiness; these are also to be rejected and abhorred, as presenting us with
deadly poison in stead of remedies.

A third there is, but, an unsufficient remedy, we do with all thankfulness
and reverence, as becomes good Subjects, receive the Kings Majesty's
Declaration of his intentions, for maintaining our Religion, and esteem it no
small happiness to live under a Prince, Orthodox in the faith, and a nurse
father of the Kirk; But his Majesty's disposition to Religion, can neither
obliedge his Royal Successors, as the frequent change of Religion in England
and other Kingdoms, what the change of the Princes, has taught us; nor can it
preserve us from the Plots and power of Papists, as we have even now learned by
the conspiracy of the Irish, English, and Scottish Papists: If they have bin
devising mischief against us in the very time of his Majesty's Declarations;
what may be in all reason expected afterward from the immortal hatred and
uncessant working, and what may we look for presently, if while they are now
in arms, their fury shall have success, and they suffered to prevail, as
they have done in Ireland: We pray God save the King: but we may say, Cursed be
their anger for it is fierce, and their wrath for it is cruel.

The first true remedy, which Christian piety and prudence ministers unto us,
is to receive the love of the truth, and to labor for the power of godliness.
It is never enough observed, that Papistry, Arminianisme and diversity of
Sects, or the just judgment of God upon many in the Reformed Kirks for their
formality in Religion: without this one remedy all other remedies will want the
blessing of God, and prove unprofitable.

A second remedy is to abhor and detest Popery, not upon conceit or common
opinion, but from the particular and distinct knowledge of the gross Heresies,
in doctrine, manifold Idolatry in worship and cruel tyranny in government,
which it teaches, defends and practices: from which the Lord in a
wonderful mercy has delivered us: against which so many thousands of the holy
and faithful Martyrs of Christ have borne record of the word of God, and of
the testimony of Jesus Christ, and washed their robes in the blood of the
Lamb, and by which the Lord suffers us and other reformed Kirks, this day to
be threatened again, because we have bin unthankful for our deliverance, not
knowing the greatness of the ill from which we have bin delivered, nor
considering the heavines of that Antichristian yoke, if it shall be again
wreathed upon our necks which would to God all Kings, Princes, Republikes, and
people would take to heart.

The third is, that all true Patriots and professors of the reformed Religion
may learn to discern and know the enemies of the Kirk, which will be found
not to be Papists only, but malignants also, who under color of the same
profession with us, oppose themselves to the preservation of religion here unto
the reformation of Religion in England, no less than Papists, who make bands
contrary or prejudicial to our National Covenant, who frame and present
Petitions, crossing the Petitions of the Commissioners of the general
Assembly, give information to the Kings Majesty, contrary to the Information of
the Kirk and Kingdom, do oppose the publishing of the necessary Declarations
of the Kirk, read papers in the Assemblies of Gods people without warrant from
the Kirk, and offer to Presbiters in all the Quarters of the Kingdom, papers
contrary to the Declarations of the Commissioners of the Assembly, do hold
their meetings against the convention of estates, and if they could find
Ministers to join with them, would keep Ecclesiastical Assemblies against the
Assemblies of the Kirk, which is the most factious, the most scandalous and the
most dangerous way of division and separation that has bin heard of in any
Kirk or Kingdom. And therefore by ecclesiastical censures and civil
punishments to be speedily and powerfully suppressed, as a most pernicious
practice tending to the destruction both of religion and peace of this Kingdom,
and directly opposite to the propagation of the Gospel and Reformation of
other Kirks, which God by his providence is bringing to pass, and is ardently
desired and constantly hoped for by all the godly.

The fourth is, if after all good means are used to reduce the enemies of
Religion, whether Papists or Malignants to repentance and obedience; the Kirk
be constrained by their obstinacy to proceed to the sentence of
Excommunication, some solid course may be taken that the civil punishment,
which is according to Law, may be really and timously inflicted, that neither
the law be eluded, nor any Delinquent for his greatness or any other respect be
exempted or spared.

The fifth is, because through want of sure and timous intelligence, a great
part of the people are either left to uncertain rumors, or slighted by the
negligence of common-bearers, or abused with malignant informations, that they
neither know their own danger, nor the danger of Religion and Country. A solid
order would be set down, thereby intelligence may go forth from order to
every shiere, and so to every Presbitery and particular pastor that the people
may be informed both of their danger and duty. And an account taken of the
faithfulness of men to their matters of so necessary and public concernment
shall be committed, and of particular Ministers, how they acquaint themselves
in matters of so great trust.

The sixth is, That for the more special applying of some clauses of our
National Covenant against the present evils, certain Articles may be framed
to be subscribed and consented unto by all the well-affected, that we may be
more strongly united amongst our selves in the cause of God, and yet all
Malignants and secret enemies, who hide themselves under the subscription of
the Covenant may be discerned and discovered.

The 7th is, That a Remonstrance may be sent to the Kings Majesty from the
Honorable Convention of Estates, expressing the present dangers of the Kirk
and Kingdom with a renewed supplication for unity in Religion and uniformity
of Kirk government, for disbanding of all Popish forces, and for using of means
for the Queens conversion.

The 8th is, Although we be very well assured of the wisdom and good
affection of this Honorable Convention, for which as a mean of great
happiness to this Kirk and Kingdom at this time, we heartily bless the Lord:
yet from the necessity of our duty which enforces us to exhort civil powers
to all vigilance and faithfulness, and according to the laudable example of
the general Assemblies of this Kirk in former times of public danger; we must
crave leave to entreat and excite your Lordships, speedily to think and
resolve upon the best ways for the safety and security of the Kingdom against
insurrection of Papists and Malignants from within and invasion from without,
which may also be a mean to try and discover the minds of the disaffected. And
to commit so great trust to none, but to such as are known to be zealous of
the safety of Religion, of the Kings honor and peace of the Kingdom.

The 9th is, Because the hearts of people are secure and slow in apprehending
of danger, and the enemies suggest, that there is not any great cause of fear:
Whenever any letters of negotiation and traffic betwixt Papists or
Malignants here, and in other places are intercepted, or any plots or
conspiracies discovered, the same without respect to any persons whatsoever,
may be published in print and sent through the Kingdom, that all may be warned
of the danger, and be in readiness to use the best means for their safety,
and that such wicked instruments may be censured and punished.

The 10th is, That for the credit of the Gospel, for keeping the public faith
of the Kingdom, and for promoving the desired and intended unity in Religion
and uniformity in Kirk government. All the Articles of the Treaty of Peace
betwixt the two Kingdoms be inviolably observed, and justice done without
partiality upon the contraveners. And for as much as at the time of the
Reformation, and in our late Declarations and Remonstrances in the time of our
troubles and since, the expressions of our desires of unity and amity with the
Kingdom of England have been many and large. And we have many times from our
feeling and fears made open profession. That the not reforming or the
endangering of Religion there, has an influence upon our Religion, and the
mutual peace of the Kingdoms; We do humbly entreat, according to the example
of the general Assemblies of this Kirk, that this Honorable Convention may be
pleased to take into their gravest consideration, the renewing of the league
and association with England for defense of Religion, against the common enemy,
and how far the same may be extended against Prelacy and Popish Ceremonies,
for uniformity in external worship and Church government.

Thus have we pointed at the principal remedies, which we humbly present to be
more particularly resolved upon by this Honorable Convention, as a matter
worthy of the gravest deliberation, and the greatest care and diligence,
wherein as we shall be required, we shall most willingly according to our place
and calling, contribute our counsels and endeavors; beseeching God who never
forsakes his people, when trouble draws near; first, to direct, and next to
fulfill all your Counsels to his own glory and the public good.

THE ANSWER OF THE CONVENTION Of ESTATES, To the Remonstrance and desires of
the Commissioners of the General Assembly.
THE Convention of the ESTATES of the KINGDOM, having more particularly
perused the Remonstrance and desires of the Commissioners of the General
Assembly, do acknowledge and with great care and solidity of heart, resent the
dangers of the reformed Religion: partly from the Rebellious attempts of
Papists in Ireland, from their power in England, where they are so long in
Arms: and partly from their hopes in this Kingdom, where they have their
Plots and correspondence amongst themselves and with their confederates abroad.
And all these the greater and the more to be taken to heart at this time, that
they have the pretense of the Kings service and authority, the confidence of
the Queens zeal to their Profession, and her power to promote their designs;
And the assistance of the Prelaticall party, and of Malignants and many others,
whom upon natural and worldly respects, they have drawn against the Oath of
the Covenant into their secret, and have united into their combination.

These and the like dangers expressed more fully in the Remonstrance, may be
more then sufficient to awake and stir up this Kirk and Kingdom to provide
for the preservation of Religion, the safety of the King, and security of the
Kingdom, which at this time in reality can no more be separated and divorced,
then in former times when it was professed both by King and people, that the
dangers of one were the dangers of all, that they had the same Common friends
and Enemies, and did stand and fall together: But while the Estates are
thinking upon that which is remonstranted unto them, many other dangers and
distresses, which more directly and immediately threaten and press this
Country and Kingdom, offer themselves to be considered and are necessary to be
universally known, That all men, even such as all this time have never taken
Religion to heart, may be made sensible of the present danger of their native
Country, wherein the private danger of every man's life, liberty, Estate and
means is included.

The Lords of privy Counsel, and the Commssioners for conserving the peace,
have already declared that a treacherous and damnable plot of the Irish,
English and Scottish Papists, was begun to be discovered by Letters found with
the Earl of Antrim, and by the deposition of one of his servants at his death:
Now the depositions of the Earl himself, and of another of his servants both
upon their oaths, have been read in face of the Convention, confirming what
was written before, of sending Ammunition to the North, and leavying of forces
in this Kingdom, and hearing that the Earl had Instructions for making peace
betwixt the English and Irish in Ireland. Like as diverse Letters are sent
hither concerning a Cessation of Arms in Ireland, and the joining of the
English and Irish forces upon oath to go for England to assist the King as is
pretended, but indeed to strengthen and aid the Papists and Prelaticall party.

Our Merchants and Mariners are not only stopped and discouraged in their
trade, by Ships, Frigots and Flie-boates of Dunkirk and of Ireland, having
Irish Commanders and Soldiers, but their Ships either taken or burnt, they
spoiled of their goods and moneys, and their persons torter'd, kept captives,
or sent away quite naked, whereby his Majesty's subjects have suffered more by
Sea upon the sudden, and in a short time, then they did suffer all the time of
our late troubles. And no other cause of all this violence and cruelty
pretended, but a Commission and Warrant from Authority.

The Earl of New-Castles Forces, Horse and Foot in great Numbers lying at the
borders, and ready when they shall be commanded, to make incursion upon the
South parts of the Kingdom, as many ill affected are no less willing to make
trouble in the North.

If the unhappy differences between his Majesty and his Parliament, shall not
be determined in a Parliamentarie way, but by the sword; Not only, shall the
Army in Ireland be in danger to be lost, but the whole Kingdom will be
involved in the common calamity.

Nor is it wisdom against the continual rumors and threatenings of foreign
invasion, to be so negligent and secure, as if there were no appearance or
possibility of danger from without. Experience has proved the contrary in
former times; And although there were no other ground. Reason does teach, that
Princes and States use to observe the opportunities of division and breaches
amongst their Neighbors.

Although the causes of calling a convention at this time were urgent enough,
yet the providence of God watching over this Kirk and Kingdom for good, has
discovered diverse of the dangers of Religion and of the Kingdom, and brought
them to light in this opportunity, while the Convention of Estates are sitting,
as if they had been called together to be informed of them and to provide
remedies against them. And therefore as the Convention is resolved to take this
matter which is of so public and deep concernement into their serious
considerations; So do they desire and require, that the Commissioners of the
Assembly, who according to their duty, and the laudable example of the
Assemblies of this Kirk in former times, have represented the dangers of
Religion, will also with diligence, think upon the best and most powerful
remedies and remonstrate them unto the Convention; That by the blessing of God
upon their joint endeavors, so many approaching and imminent miseries may be
turned away, and the Religion and peace which God Almighty of his singular
mercy, has granted to this Kirk and Kingdom, may be preserved and transmitted
unto the after generations, which shall be honor to God, safety to the King
and his Posterity, and happiness to his people.

FINIS.
