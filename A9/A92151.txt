A true and perfect Copy of the LORD ROOS His Answer to the Marquess of
Dorchester's LETTER written the 25 of February 1659.
SIR,
SUre you were among your Gallypots and Glisterpipes, when you gave your
Choler so violent a Purge, to the fouling of so much innocent paper, and your
own reputation (if you had any, which the wise very much doubt) you had better
bin drunk and set in Stocks for it, when you sent the Post with a whole packet
of Chartells to me; in which you have discovered so much vapouring nonsense and
railing, that it is wholsomer for your credit, to have it thought the effect of
drink, then your own natural talent in perfect mind and memory: for if you
understand any thing in your own Trade, you could not but know that the Hectic
of your own brain is more desperate then the Tertian fits of mine, which are
easily cured with a little sleep; but yours is past the remedy of a Mortar and
braying. But I wonder with what confidence you can accuse me with the discovery
of private passages between us, when you are so open your self, that every man
sees through you; or how could I disclose perfectly any thing in your Epistles
to my Father and Mother, which was not before very well known to your Tutors
and Schoolmasters, whose instructions you used in compiling those voluminous
works. Let any man judge, whether I am so likely to divulge secrets as you, who
cannot forbear Printing and publishing: Your Labors are now cried in the
streets of London, with Ballads on the Rump, and Hewsons Lamentations; and the
Lord of Dorchester's name makes a greater noise in a close Alley then
Kitchingstuffe, or work for a Tinker: and all this by your own industry, who
are not ashamed at the same instant to pretend to secrecy, with no less
absurdity then you commit, when accusing me for using foul Language, you do
out do Billinsgate your self. But now you begin to vapor, and to tell us you
have (...) before: so I have heard you have, with your Wife, and Poet, but if
you came of^ with no more honor then when you were beaten by my Lord
Grandison, you had better have kept that to your felf, if it were possible for
you to conceal any thing: but I cannot but laugh at the untoward course you
take to render your self formidable, by bragging of your Fights, when you are
terrible only in your medicines: if you had told us how many you had killed
that way, and how many you have cut in pieces, besides Calves and Dogs, a right
valiant man that has any wit, would tremble to come near you: and if by your
threatening to ram your Sword down my throat, you do not mean your Pills,
which are a more dangerous weapon, the worst is past, and I am safe enough: for
as for your Feats of Arms, there is no half quarter of a man that is so
wretched, but would venture to give you battayl, but you are most unsufferable
in your unconscionable engrossing of all Trades: Is it not enough that you are
already as many things as any of your own receipts, that you are a Doctor of
the Civil Law, and a Barister at the Common, a Bencher of Gray's-Inne, a
professor of Physic and a Fellow of the College; a Mathematician, Caldean, a
Schoolman and a piece of a Grammarian, (as your last work can show were it
construed) a Philosopher, Poet, Translator, Antisocordist, Solliciter, Broker
and Usurer; besides a Marquess, Earl, Vicount and Baron; but you must, like
Dr. Subtle, profess quarrelling too, and publish your self an Hector; of which
calling there are so many already, that they can hardly live on by another.
Sir, truly there is no conscience in it, considering you have not only, a more
sure and safe way of killing men already then they have, but a plentiful Estate
besides: So many Trades, and yet have so little conscience to eat the bread out
of their mouths; they have great reason to lay it to heart, and I hope some of
them will demand reparation of you and make you give them compounding dinners
too, as well as you have done to the rest of your Fraternities; and now be your
own Judge, whether any one man can be bound in honor to Fight with such an
Hydra as you are; a Monster of many heads, like the multitude, or the Devil
that called himself Legion; such an encounter would be no Duel but War, which
I never heard that any one man ever made alone; and I must levy Forces ere I
can meet you, for if every one of your capacities had but a Second, you would
amount to a Brigade, as your Letter does to a Declaration; in which I cannot
omi^ that in one respect you have dealt very ingeniously, and that is, in
publishing to the world, that all your Heroical resolutions are built upon
your own opinion of my want of courage: this argues you well studied in the
dimensions of quarrelling; among which, one of the chiefest shows how to take
measure of another man's valor, by comparing it with your own, to make your
approaches accordingly: but as the least mistake betrays you to an infallible
beating, so you had fared, and perhaps had had the Honor which you seem to
desire, of falling by my Sword, if I had not thought you a thing fitter for any
man's contempt then anger.

Roos.
