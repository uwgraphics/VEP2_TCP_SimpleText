London, Printed by John Macock, 1660. April 11.

To His Excellency the Lord General Monck, Captain General of all the Forces Of
ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, and IRELAND.
The Humble Remonstrance and Address of the Officers of the Armies under Your
Excellencies Command.
WE the Officers of the Army under Your Excellencies Command, whose Names are
hereunder written, being truly and deeply sensible of the merciful and
wonderful Providence of Almighty God in bringing us after so many Revolutions
and Changes into an hopeful way of Settlement; And perceiving to our great
grief; that there are too many, who seeking more their own Private Interest
than the Public Good, are endeavoring to reduce us again to our old
Necessities and Confusions, and that they have proceeded so far as to cause
Jealousies in the Council of State, in whom the Supreme Power and Trust now,
till the meeting of the Parliament, is residing; Do hold it our Duties for the
preventing of all such Jealousies for the future, and for the strengthening of
Your Excellencies Hands in the carrying on of this good work, in which it has
pleased God to make you so highly Instrumental, humbly to make this Address
unto Your Excellency, in the name of our selves and all the Soldiers under our
Commands, and to Declare, That we shall, according to our Duties, carry and
behave our selves as Officers of an Army instructed by Your Example and
Discipline, to obey and not dispute the Orders of our Superiors, and shall
freely and readily observe such Commands as we shall receive from Your
Excellency, or the Council of State, or the Parliament when Assembled: And in
particular we shall, according to the late Proclamation of the Council of State
of March 17. decline any meeting or meetings for the contriving or carrying on
of any Declaration or Subscriptions concerning Affairs of State or Government,
thereby avoiding those mischiefs which made many lately in Arms so justly
distasteful to the People, by making themselves a divided Interest from the
rest of them. And we are the more willing to make this Address at this time, to
evince to all the world the Integrity of our Obedience, because of the great
expectation of the next Parliament, from whom we hope for an happy Settlement
to all the Nations; And that they may have no ill apprehensions of us, we are
resolved, as it becomes us in duty, to submit to whatsoever the Lord shall
bring forth from their Consultations, knowing that Parliaments only can secure
us in our Religious and Civil Rights. And forasmuch as many Representations
heretofore made to Persons in eminent Authority have been too frequently
contrived in the Name of the Army, which were done rather in formality (as we
perceive by the event) than otherwise, we do solemnly desire that this may be
Recorded as a Testimony and Witness against Us, if ever we shall be guilty of
any such Backslidings.

Your Excellencies most Obedient Servants.

THe Reader may be pleased to take notice, That the reason why the
Subscriptions in some Regiments are not complete, is because the Officers were
not present at their Commands at the time of the Subscriptions; as also, that
several Officers of the Armies being present at St. James's at the presenting
of this Remonstrance, although the Subscriptions of their Regiments were not
here, would not omit to testify their affections by subscribing with their
Fellows that had set their hands to this great Roll; and do intend in the
respective Subscriptions of their particular Regiments to renew the action of
obedience: which all the Regiments, to whom it has been communicated, do
concur in, and are now preparing their Addresses.

FINIS.
