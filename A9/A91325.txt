A Psalm of Thanksgiving to be sung by the Children of Christ's Hospital, on
Tuesday in the Easter Holy Days, at S. Mary's Spittle, for their Founders and
Benefactors. Anno Domini, 1641.
Chorus. ^ OUR hearts we raise, This is to be sung by all the Children, and
repeated after every Verse.
in thanks and praise, thy sacred Name to bless, ^ Since thou ( O Lord) do
thus afford, our sorrows to redress.

Versus. ^ WHen Jacobs heirs thou did direct, to Canaans milkey Land, Thy
mercy, Lord, did ^ them protect, and guide them with thy hand: By Moses Rod
thou gav'st ^ them food, and made their waters sweet; The Red-Seas waves as
Pillars stood, and Jordan shunned their ^ feet. In Clouds by day, thy love did
keep, them, and their wants supply: And through the blackest ^ darksome night,
fire did their way descry. Chorus. Our hearts we raise, etc.

Jordans of tears ( Lord) thou have dried from off our weeping eyes,
Thy providence our grief descried and hearkened to our cries.
When nights of woes in vales of death made all our hopes depart,
Loves fire was kindled by thy breath in our good Patrons heart.
Their staff of Bread like Moses Rod, did on the waters prove,
Thy loving might (most gracious God) and greatness of thy love.
Chorus. Our hearts we raise, etc.
Build-up thy Churches broken walls, and crown this Land with Peace:
Anoint thy Churches regal head, with glory never to cease.
Upon his Spouse, our Royal Queen, and pledges of their love;
On Clergy and Nobility, rain blessings from above.
This City with thy grace enrich, here make thine Arc to rest;
Lord, let the Mayor and Aldermen, with happy years be blessed.
Chorus. Our hearts we raise, etc.
