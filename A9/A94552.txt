To the Kings Most Excellent Majesty.
The Most humble Address of the Ministers of the word of God in the County of
LINCOLN, whose Names, etc.
Most Dread Sovereign,
AMong all the great Calamities which God most justly for our Sins has brought
upon us since the first commencing of our National Distractions; none have made
so deep impression of real sorrow upon our hearts as the barbarous inhumanity
acted upon your Royal Father of happy memory, by certain wicked and deceitful
men; the remembrance whereof, as it does renew our utmost abhorrency of the
Act, so of all those Jesuitical Principles which under any pretense whatsoever,
have a tendency to the deposing, and much more the murder of Kings.

After the loss of the best deserving King the World could then boast of,
which was attended with the voice of Blasphemy uttered by our Enemies against
the true Religion, because some who did profess it has stayn'd her beauty
with their bloody hands; Gall was added to our Wormwood by the forced exile of
your Majesty; during whose absence abroad, we could hardly think our selves to
be at home.

But God who comfort those who are cast down, gave us hope in the wonderful
preservation of your Majesty at Worcester, the Supplications made for you by
your faithful people, and establishment of your Royal heart, with his grace to
resist and overcome a great Crowd of Temptations, both upon the right hand and
on the left, by holding fast the True, Ancient, Catholic and Apostolical
Faith, once delivered to the Saints. These things were to us as the dawning of
the day of Salvation, which God after a dark night of Confusion has now (not
by an ordinary working os Providence) caused to shine upon us: And we have
cause to believe, that he who has subdued the power of your Enemies, will also
subdue their hearts; that as your Majesty's return has been accompanied with
the cordial desire and joy of the most of your Subjects; so your Reign will be
with the great Love and full Satisfaction of all: of this our Confidence is the
more increased by your Majesty's Gracious, Charitable, and Healing Declaration
of the first of May; and the early Proclamation issued out against vicious,
debaucht and profane Persons; for which, as we are always bound to praise
God, so we do with all humble Thankfulness acknowledge your Majesty's Special
grace and Princely favor: And whatever our earnests Prayers to God,
Exhortations to our hearers, and dutiful subjection may possibly contribute to
the happiness of your Sacred Person and Government, we shall with all alacrity
and faithfulness perform, beseeching him by whom Kings Reign, to increase
your graces, preserve your health, prolong your days, and establish the Crown
upon your Head.

This Address was presented to his Majesty in the privy Chamber at Whitehall on
Tuesday the 24 of July 1660. together with a short Speech made by Robert
Sanderson, Doctor of Divinity, who was accompanied with the following
Ministers, John Naylor Vicar of Boston Jeremiah Vasyn Rector of Skyrbecke
Edward Dix Rector of Kirkby la-Thorpe William Lincoln William Dales Rector of
Hag-worthingham George Cuthbert Rector of Willoughhy Edward Ayscough Rector of
North-Thoresby Charles Woodward Vicar of Alford Robert Alington Rector of
Hougham Henry Vaughan Vicar of Grantham Andrew Arnold Rector of Marham Edward
Boteler Rector of Wintringham John Merryweather Rector of West Halton Thomas
Trott Rector of Barkston.


May it please your most Excellent Majesty,
THe Clergy of the County of Lincoln desire by me to present to your most
Excellent Majesty their most humble Address, In expression of their great joy
for your Majesty's happy restoring to your Crown and People, and of their loyal
affection to your Majesty's royal Person and Government: without offering to
your Majesty any thing either of Petition or Complaint.
