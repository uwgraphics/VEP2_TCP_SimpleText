The Declaration and Vindication of Isaac Pennington now Lord Mayor of the
City of London, of Colonel Ven, Captain Manwaring, and Mr. Fowke.
WHereas by diverse late Expresses and Letters to the City of London, we found
our selves aimed at by His Sacred Majesty, as men that have disturbed the
public peace of the City; of which we are in our own consciences altogether
guiltless, having neither acted nor attempted any thing against the
tranquillity thereof; nor had any intentions, but what tended to the true
service of his Majesty, the good of the Commonwealth, and the security of
the City of London. And have furthermore never done or imagined ought, but
what we had just authority from the High Court of Parliament, which we were
bound in conscience and equity to obey, being so publicly, and in the eyes of
the whole Kingdom, as well of this City, whereof we are members, charged
with delinquencie: We esteemed our selves bound, in vindication of our
innocence, to set forth these our serious Declarations of our own integrities,
knowing well that such charges in the too credulous people, who censure men's
actions by the event, rather than intention, might beget an opinion that we are
really guilty; when before God and our consciences we do believe, and dare
affirm we have neither practiced, or attempted ought, which was not
warrantable by the known Laws and constitutions of the Kingdom, and for the
defense of Gods true Religion and worship; yet some malignants as it should
appear, have informed His sacred Majesty, and others have instilled the same
poison to our fames and reputations into the ears of the people, especially in
the City of London, that we have bin, and are desirous to advance innovations
in the true Church of England, and bring in strange doctrines of Brownisme,
Anabaptisme, and the like, things so far from our thoughts, much less meanings
that we should scarcely know their names, were we not instructed in them by
those as pursue calumnies, which would make us if not the Authors, at least the
promoters and defenders of them, when for our parts we have always esteemed
the doctrine of the Church of England perfect and Orthodoxall, and so have ever
demeaned our selves as true sons of the said Church, though perhaps some
innovations and insolences (which are not unknown to the whole world,
attempted, if not committed by the Bishops and Prelates) upon the persons and
estates of sundry of Gods faithful servants, might make us desire an abatement
of their pride, and a reformation of those gross abuses which they sought by
their unlimited power and authority to obtrude upon the Church; and therein
surely we performed nothing but what was agreeable to the justice of Gods and
the Kingdoms Laws, and what equally desired by the whole body of the Kingdom
now assembled in this present Parliament for the same end; namely, to rectify
and reform those so long predominant errors in the Church, which had almost
grown up again to that abolished doctrine of Papisme in this Realm, and
obscured the verity of true Religion, by their Ceremonies and circumstances,
which were as vain and useless as they were superstitious and ridiculous, if
not profane and impious; yet for this our integrity, we know that diverse have
been apt to censure us, and impute this our zeal in Gods cause, to a desire of
Innovation; But surely our innocence acquits us of those scandals, and they
might as well blame Iehu for seeking to destroy all those in Israel that had
bowed to Baal, as us for our prosecution by the Laws of the Land, convicted
Papists and Recusants; and charged him thereby, that he intended an innovation
rather then a reformation in the Religion of the Israelites. For any other of
our attempts or practices with which we stand charged, as namely, or at least
by evident circumstance, for advancing the affairs of the Common wealth, and
being subservient to the commands of the Honorable the High Court of
Parliament, by putting their ordinances in practice for the levying of moneys
upon the inhabitants of the City of London, to help to defray the charge of the
Army raised for the defense of His Majesty and Parliament, certainly we had
most convincing reasons to indeare it as much as lay in our powers: For first,
we beheld the Kingdom torn and dilacerated into a thousand distractions by
the counsels of malignants, who merely aimed at their own wicked and sinister
ends, and for that purpose, by their seditious devises had separated His
Majesty from His High Court of Parliament, convocated by His sacred authority,
to treat of the doubtful and difficult affairs of the Kingdom, and to set at
right the oppressive abuses thereof, the said malignants seeking utterly to
destroy the essence of Parliaments, wherein the safety of the Subject
principally consists, as is not unknown to all well affected persons. We
beheld likewise by the perverse counsel of the said malignants, an Army raised
by His Majesty's command, for what end we could not conjecture, unless for the
destruction of the Kingdom, the subduing the people, and subverting the
fundamental Laws of the Land, which Army, how destructive it has been to the
good subjects of the Realm, the inhumane plundrings of the Cavaliers, their
taking away peoples estates, firing their houses, and murdering their persons,
has given to the whole world a sufficient testimony, and after their bloody
perambulation through most of the Counties of the Kingdom, and their
commitment of robberies and massacres. We beheld them drawing their forces this
way toward this noble City of London, which was the mark their avarice shot
at, the end which they in their ravenous minds had intended by all
probabilities to arrive, the abundant wealth and infinite riches of this great
and populous City, being that supply which they expected should build up the
ruins of their decayed fortunes, and be an ample salary for their desperate
designs, which had almost devoured the wealth of the whole Kingdom, and only
thirsted for the spoils of us and our families.

Besides, in the said army we were as certain there were gathered together as
well Commanders as Soulders, diverse notorious Popish Recusants, who by the
Laws of the land ought not only to bear arms, but likewise to be disinabled
from bearing arms, by taking away all their military furniture, and provision
of war: the whole Kingdom at least the well-affected persons thereof,
evidently knowing that the sword being once put into the hands of Papists, they
would use it without all mercy against the breasts of all true Protestants, and
such as were zealous in the worship of the Almighty; yet this Army we saw
drawn down (at least the better part thereof,) even to our very doors, within
five miles of our habitations, threatening the City of London, and the
Parliament there sitting with unavoyded ruin, if they had not been prevented,
and the utter extirpation, as it was probable enough, of Gods true Religion;
surrounded therefore with so many dangers and imminent perils which hung like
so many teeming clouds over our heads, menacing destruction to our wives,
houses and families; nay, desolation to the whole City, let all the world be
but indifferent judges, whether we, who were interressed with the chief charge
and care of the City, had not reason to look about us, and provide for the
safety of the City, one of us having the principal government thereof, and
the rest of us being able and sufficient Members of the said City, whether we
had not cause not only to put the Order of the high Court of Parliament in
practice with diligence, for the raising men and moneys for the defense of our
selves and the City, but also to render them condign and humble thanks for
their care and provision for our securities, and whether it was not requisite
that the City of London, being the capital place of the Kingdom, and the
chiefest Magazine it has both for wealth and arms, should advance the
greatest sums of moneys toward the supportment of these necessities,
defensive wars undertaken by the command and order of Parliament for the
safeguard of the subjects liberties, and the security of the true Protestant
Religion. Certainly had the Citizens contributed in stead of the twentieth part
the half of their Estates to an use so necessary and pious, they had but made
a just domonstration of their loves to the Commonwealth, and their cares to
their selves and families, it being far more requisite for them to part with
the twentieth part of their Estates, so to secure the rest, then by the
detention of that, not only to hazard their whole lively hoods and fortunes,
but their lives and liberties to the desperate fury of those Malignants and
Cavaliers, who think of no other law, nor acknowledge no other conscience but
their inordinate lusts. And so confident are we of our integrities, having done
nothing but what has been authorized us by Order from the high Court of
Parliament; that we both hope and believe when his sacred Majesty, abandoning
the counsel of those Malignants, who have incensed his goodness as well
against his high Court of Parliament, as against us, shall really and rightly
consider our actions and intentions, his sacred wisdom will not only acquit
our innocences of any dis-service to himself, the tranquillity of the
Kingdom, or welfare of the City of London, by our forwardness in setting
forth the Order of the high Court of Parliament, and levying of moneys for the
support and maintenance of these wars against the Cavaliers, but will thank
us for our diligence, which has been a principal means to preserve the City
of London from devastation and ruin, and defended Gods true Religion from the
machinations of Popish Recusants; and for the Citizens of London, who may by
the violence of the said aspersions be drawn to believe the said opinions, we
all hope they will by this our Vindication of our innocence, be persuaded to
believe our integrities, which have always tended to the service of his
Majesty and the advancement of the Commonwealth, the defense of the
Protestant Religion, and the demonstration of our obedience to the honorable
the high Court of Parliament.

FINIS.
