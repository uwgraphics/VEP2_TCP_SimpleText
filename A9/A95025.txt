A TRUE COPY OF THE PETITION OF THE KNIGHTS, IVSTICES OF The peace, and other
Gentlemen, Ministers and Freeholders (in number many thousands) of the County
of Monmouth, exhibited May 17. 1642.
To the Honorable the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses assembled in the house
of Commons.
The Petition of the Knights, Justices of the Peace, Esquires, Gentlemen,
Freeholders, with others the Inhabitants of the County of Monmouth.
Humbly Shows,
THat although we have such a doleful president of misery and calamity so
near us, on our brethren in Ireland, and such dangers and distempers appearing
and increasing even in our own Kingdom; yet we in Wales of all others, and in
Monmouth Shire above the rest, cannot but be most sensible and suspicious of
our own imminent destruction, as being compassed about with Papists, more in
number, and stronger in power, Arms, Horse, and Ammunition, than any other
County (as we conceive) in the Kingdom besides, who though they have been
always many and strong, yet they stirred little till these late unhappy
opportunities; wherein, to the great terror of the Kings faithful Subjects
throughout the County, they spare no pains or cost to fit and strengthen
themselves for their secret designs; witness their endeavor to take up most
of the great houses near them, for Popish strangers, retaining also diverse of
great rank in their own houses; the denying the removal of the Magazine,
contrary to the express order of this Honorable House; with such like
practices, proclaiming to all that observe them, their pernicious intentions,
and our danger, the County being the while wholly unprovided for defense.

WE do therefore humbly beseech this Honorable Assembly to take these our
dangers into your grave and wise considerations, and maturely to vouchsafe some
effectual order for our security; which cannot, as we humbly conceive, be
enjoyed, till the Magazine be removed to Newport, the County set in a posture
of defense, the Papists by some stronger force (then our own) disarmed, the
long looked for aid from England and Scotland dispatched, for the relieving of
distressed, and even despairing Ireland, otherwise we cannot hope to be in
safety, when our next neighbors houses are thus on fire; And as your humble
Petitioners do most thankfully acknowledge your great and unparalelled
industry and integrity for the public good of Church and Commonwealth: So
shall we, with our dearest lives and fortunes most loyally and faithfully ever
defend his Majesty's royal person, vindicate your Honors, and maintain the
rights and privileges of Parliament against all opposition whatsoever.

And We shall ever pray, etc.
Printed by order of the Petitioners, for William Larnar, at the sign of the
Bible in little East-Cheape. 1642.
