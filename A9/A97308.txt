A WORD TO THE OFFICERS of the ARMY.
Unto You who at first were raised up by a mighty Spirit, to go forth with the
Sword in your hands, to recover some long lost Liberties of the good People of
England, from under the tyranical powers of Kings and Bishops; unto whom was
truly given the Title of the Lords Host, because you went forth in his Name,
and for his People, and therefore were crowned with wonderful Successes, and
Victories, over your enemies, unto a perfect Conquest, even unto You is this
W^^d of Truth. nouemb: 23 1657
YOU have been weighed in the balance of Justice by the Spirit of the Lord in
many of his Servants, and are found too light; having not been faithful to the
end, to effect those great things, which were written in your hearts to do,
your righteousness has proved like the morning dew, it is now vanished, your
light is gone out like the snuff of a candle: you who once were as a sweet
savor unto the good people of the Nation, are now become like salt that has
lost its first savor and is fit for naught, having neglected to carry on the
work of the Lord, have ended in your selves, featherd your own nests, and lie
down at ease, and hereby have exposed your selves, your names, your
professions, prayers, fastings, promises and engagements, to the scorn and
reproach of your very enemies, and the worst of men through the Nation, and to
the great grief of the best, whose hearts have mourned for you, and this
because you stand not and abide in that Counsel and Spirit of God, in which
you first went forth, to be servants unto him in carrying on the great work of
Reformation; but have united your selves and complied with the old corrupt
powers and Interests of the Nation, and thereby caused the great Work of God
put into your hands to go backward; and now stand wholly in your own powers and
wills, and therefore has there been a rent among you, that those who were most
faithful departed from you, and are as Witnesses of God against you.

Pray consider with your selves a little, whether the great Ends be effected,
for which you took up the Sword? if you say they be, That our Enemies are
conquered, and the grand Enemy received justice, and that Antichristian power
of Bishops laid flat, and the pride and glory of our Nobles stained.

Answ. It is true, and by a mighty power was this done, but was it persons you
contended with only, or the corrupt state of things? there was indeed a deep
wound given by you, but it was not deadly, for you your selves are curing that
wound, which once you made: you conquered persons, and took possession of their
spirits, and entered into their power, and if any corruption were destroyed
with them, is it not revived in you? and has not the Spirit of Kings and
Nobles a great resurrection in you? and your conquest outwardly over them,
could not be more complete, then their conquest over you, through the help and
power of the God of this world, who has made you even drunk with their spirit,
and has allured you to follow their steps.

If we consider a little the original and ground of the late War, was it not,
that the King and Bishops did take too much upon them, the King he illegally
imposing Ship Money upon his Subjects, and some other things. And the other
imposing Laws upon the consciences of men, which were grounds of suffering to
many, and did breed a general discontent in the good people of the Land, which
grew so high, that it broke forth into public speeches, and at length unto
open War. But the principal ground of the War was, not so much from the King
apart, or any Acts of his, which tended to the oppression of his Subjects; it
would be a strange thing so to imagine, for it could never have quit cost, but
the remedy would be manifest to be a thousand times worse then the disease.
Therefore we must lay it upon the King as in Conjunction with that
Antichristian Clergy the state of Bishops, and all their body of Hirelings, his
giving power to them, to Lord it over the minds and consciences of men; And
this power, growing to a height of corruption, and being swollen big with pride
and designs of evil unto any that stood up against them, and could not
conform to them, even then did the special providence of God put a period and
stop to that Spirit.

Now the But of Malice of King, Court, Bishops, and Nobles, with all their
Officers under them in conjunction with the ignorant, profane, and
superstitious people of the Land, was the poor People of God dissenting from
them, and therefore were persecuted in their Courts as Schismatics and
Heretics, who rent from the Church; and these then bore the names of Puritans,
Separates, Brownists, Anabaptists, etc. then a very contemptible generation of
men, generally poor and despised, yet even these were witnesses of God in that,
and against that corrupt generation, and were then accounted the troublers of
England, when they meddled not with matters of state or power but were quiet in
their several places, praying for a Change, till God opened a door for their
liberty upon other occasions.

Now behold your original, and where your true Interest lies, and where it is
l^st: It lies in the broken, poor despised People of God dissenting from the
worlds worship and ways: while you were true to them, and their liberties, you
did abide in your first Principles faithfulness; but in as much as you have
quit that Interest, you have forgotten your selves and your own original; and
are fallen from the truth, by making a league and friendship with this world,
which always stood directly opposite to Christian liberty.

Again, mind where the witness of truth lies; it generally is under the
Cr^sse and Sufferings. God has his Witnesses for himself in every generation,
even in that generation which once appeared to have passed away, were many of
you witnesses for him against that corrupt state of things; and therefore did
you with many more in the Nation, lie under shame and reproach and suffered
from that power several ways. Now while the witness lives, there is no
compliance or friendship with this world, because it is the great matter
witnessed against, for the world is a state by it self, and is that which
stands apart and distinct from the Spirit and Kingdom of Christ, and is in
direct opposition thereunto, and therefore can never be owned by the true
Spirit, because it would swallow up all into it self, and bring the Kingdom
of Christ under it, assuming all power and Authority over the minds and
consciences of men, and commonly and outwardly expresses it self in pride and
pomp, thrones and dominions, which is evermore attended with oppression and
cruelty, and the God of this world rules in it as the very soul of it.

Now in as much as you have entered into union and compliance with this spirit
of the world, you have quit your old Interest, and lost the witness of God,
which is too too manifest among you, that you are back sliders from the truth,
grown proud and lofty and swollen big with honors and greatness, having drunk
deep of the Spirit of this world, which you once in your low estate witnessed
against.

If I may compare you with the former power that you fought against, will there
appear much difference, or will you in the least be gainers by it? surely not,
but great lo^sers, for to speak of the Nation in general what the advantages
are by your Conquest, that is so plain it needs not be mentioned; that the
burdens, Taxes, Excise, and Customs extraordinary, do plainly render us in a
far worse condition, then in any late Kings reign.

But that which might have made most for your advantage, and would have been a
sufficient return for all outward losses (had you remained faithful) had been
the procuring and settling the Spiritual Liberties of the People of God (so far
as they be external) under the several administrations of the Spirit in their
several and different forms in Religion, wherein they walk peaceably, that no
civil power might have mingled it self with the Kingdom of Christ for the
bringing in any forceable Reformation therein, and the subjecting of it to any
outward and secular power; and herein was a great price put into your hands, to
have been as a wall and Bulwark to the People of God, and a protection from the
violence of the w^^ked and profane People, that so light and truth might have
had a more free, and easy entrance among us. But since your declining and
falling from your first love and zeal, and that the Earth has come over you
and choked your witness, you have given up that power once in your hand, and
so lost the price having no heart thereto, are grown careless and corrupt in
judgment, and so have suffered a great breach to be made upon Christian
Liberty by your selves, and by most in power in the Nation, in permitting and
causing so much Persecution of that poor despised and righteous people called
Quakers; which most Prisons in the Nation do witness, and it is not possible
for you to set free your selves and the Nation from the guilt of their many and
cruel sufferings; and yet many of these were of you, and from you, and are
your surviving witnesses, that when and where you left, they came forth, not
with your gallant words and lofty notions, to please their hearers, but with
brokennesse of spirit in humility and selfe-denyall, neglecting and quitting
all the honors and profits of this world, that would not consist with a
Disciple of Christ, a People just in their dealings among men, deceiving none,
opp^essing none, desiring no man's silver or bread for naught, and yet even
these finds as hard measure from you, as they might from Turks. And if inquiry
be made of what Laws they have broken? what is their trasgression? the answer
commonly is, because they are Quakers, and sometimes because they will not put
off their hats, sometimes for coming into your Churches, and making some reply
to the Minister for preaching false doctrine to the people, which is their
grand crime: And for these and such like Offenses as you judge them, are they
dragged to Prison, and there often are worse used then the common rogues; so
that if strangers should hear of their sufferings only, they might suppose
them to be great plotters of mischief against the State, and some notorious
and wicked persons: but for a sober, strict, quiet and conscientious people
thus to suffer under you, and those in power in the Nation, does plainly
discover you, that you have forgotten that liberty of conscience, which once
you professed and practiced; for how often did many of you, when you were in your
zeal for truth, go into Congregations, and reprove the Ministers for hirelings,
and for the false doctrine they preached, and enter their Pulpits and Preach
your selves? is it a crime now, and was it not then? or did the Ministers then
only preach errors, and not now? or do you believe in your consciences that
you were of more understanding to know truth and error then these people are?
or is it not a plain compliance with them to strengthen your Interest by them?
Pray consider, I am sure of this that you would have accounted that Justice of
Peace an enemy to the State and to the truth, and a great Persecuter that
should then have sent some of you to Prison, or caused you to be whipped, or put
to hard labor, for your so doing: but the power was in your own hands, that
the pesecuting spirit in Justices which now acts, did not then dare to appear;
and as all that zeal for truth in you is slain by the God of this world, so
does the persecuring spirit arise in those that have power in the Nation, as
well as your selves, and you do now by your apostasy give life and spirit to
them, who did not dare formerly to manifest themselves. And now things are so
turned about, that a man may with much more safety and security go hear an
Episcopal Minister and the old Common Prayer again, then go to a meeting of
these innocent People, for unto one is safety, but to the other perpetual
danger, either by the rude multitude or by corrupt Justices.

Further, what strange provision is made to make these People transgressors, by
Acts of Parliament, the one for disturbing public Preachers, as you esteem it,
the other to suppress them as rogues and vagabonds; what plottings and
contrivings are there now to spread their nets, to catch and undermine these
righteous servants of God: And this may be truly said, that the number of these
sufferers have been more under this present power, then of all the Sectaries
put together in the whole reign of the late King; And if some special power
and providence of God do not step in to stop and allay this Antichristian
spirit that is full of enmity and big with persecutions; OF England, England,
thou art like to be stained with the blood of the Innocent.

But do not deceive your selves, for though you revive Kings and Nobles,
Lawyers and Priests, and summon these with the worst of the people to your
assistance, that you may hold up a rotten state of things, yet notwithstanding
the work of the Lord must go on, and is carried on by a contemptible people
whom you despise, though not by might or power, but by the Spirit of the Lord.

Therefore, Oh that you might be warned, not to touch any of the Lords
anointed ones, for whatsoever you do against them, will be found in his
appearing to be against him; and truly there is great cause to believe, that if
Christ himself should appear now in person, you would deal as hardly with him,
as with other the Servants of God, cast him out of your Synagogues, hale him to
Prison, take him up as a rogue or vagabond, to be whipped or set to hard labor;
for know, that it is but the same spirit that would do it to the least of his
Disciples, as to himself.

Therefore, you who have the least tenderness left, and the least sense of
your back slidings, stand still, and seriously consider what you are doing,
whose Interest you serve, and you will then see your work ended, or stuck in
the mire; that your locks are cut and strength is gone; that the God of this
world has bribed you, and hired you to his service; that you are posting back
again to serve him under Kings, Princes, Nobles, and Bishops; that they (who
hated you) may shake hands with you, and say, Are you also become one with us.
Even thus are you departing and departed from your old Interest and marring
your selves to a Harlot, that will prove false to you, and deceive you at last.

But notwithstanding the Confederacy, Combinations, Counsels and designs of
all the powers on Earth, to keep Christ out of his Throne, yet will the Lord
exalt his Son in the midst of us, and the Scattered dust of Sion shall live and
reign with him in the midst of her Enemies.
