To the Kings most excellent Majesty.
The humble Petition of many thousands faithful and peaceably affected
Subjects of the County of YORK, who are here now assembled.
Humbly shows,
THat many of your Petitioners being in the last desires of petitioning, your
Majesty denied access, kept back with violence, and received, great affront
from some that have dependence to your Majesty, and others there assembled, yet
no provocation could remove them from their patience and duty, which
proceedings are taken more to heart, your Petitioners conceiving it undeniable,
that they have an interest in the Commonwealth, and are as dutiful and loyal
Subjects to your Majesty, as any whatsoever; though diverse of them have been
since uncivilly pressed by some in your Majesty's name, to subscribe a Paper,
styled, The Humble Answer to your Majesty's Propositions, and threatened
thereunto, upon which clause followed, That when your Majesty's Army should be
on foot, those should be first pillaged that refused such subscription, which
we humbly conceive are positively contrary to your Majesty's own expressions,
and is to the high dishonor of your Majesty, and the great affrightment and
disturbance of your Majesty's liege people; therefore your Petitioners having
just cause to fear your Majesty's Royal heart is still endangered to be
possessed with some distaste of your Petitioners; humbly supplicate your
Majesty to conceive better things of them, and to cast your eyes upon the
presant state of this your Kingdom, that as your Majesty has often Declared
your affections to this County, so your love might now be expressed in the
preserving the peace thereof: And that your Majesty would admit of a right
Information of the clear intention of your Petitioners, who are confident that
no so absolute and happy observance to your Majesty's just Commands can be
demonstrated, as which your Majesty, in Parliament shall declar, ewhich if it
should come divided (which God forbid) our hearts even tremble to consider what
danger and diminution of the Honor and safety of your Majesty's Posterity and
Kingdom, will unavoidably be put upon, since it is cleate to every
understanding eye, that it is not a divided part of one or several Counties
that can afford that honor and safety to your Maiesti^; that your whole
Kingdom, which you may command, no ground of fear or danger remaining, if a
good confidence were begotten betwixt your Majesty and Parliament, whose grave
and Loyal Council, as we humbly conceive, the visible way under God, to put a
speedy end to the troubles of Ireland, and to establish your Throne in
Righteousness.

Lastly, your Petitioners most humbly supplicate, that we may represent our
unfitness to become Judges betwixt your Majesty and Parliament, in any thing,
or to dispute the Authority of either, which they humbly conceive do fortify
each other, it being most unfit for them to act any thing therein, but by their
Prayers for a right understanding betwixt your Majesty and them; which we shall
heartily do: as also for your Majesty's long and prosperous Reign, and as we
are bound by our true Protestation, shall be ready to maintain your Majesty's
just Right, the Privilege and power of Parliament, and the lawful Liberties
of the Subjects.

This Petition was delivered at the General meeting of the Yorkshiere men,
being in number about 7000. on Thursday last.
