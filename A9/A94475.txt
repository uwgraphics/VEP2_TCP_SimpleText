TO THE HONORABLE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS Assembled in PARLIAMENT. The humble
Petition of many thousand poor people, in and about the City of LONDON
Humbly shows,
THat your Petitioners have lain a long time under great pressures and
grievances both in liberties and consciences, as has been largely at sundry
times showed and declared by several Petitions exhibited to this Honorable
Assembly, both by the Citizens and Apprentises of the City of London, and
diverse Counties and parts of this Kingdom, from which we hoped long ere this,
by Your Pious care, to have been delivered; but now we (who are of the meanest
rank and quality, being touched with penury) and are very sensible of the
approaching storms of ruin which hang over our heads, and threaten to
overwhelme us by reason of these sad distractions, occasioned chiefly and
originally (as your Petitioners humbly conceive, by the prevalency of the
Bishops and Popish Lords, and others of that malignant faction, who make
abortive all good motions, which tend for the peace and tranquillity of this
Kingdom of England; and have hitherto hindered the sending relief to our
brethren in Ireland, although they lie weltering in blood, which has given
such head to the Adversary, that we justly fear the like calamity inevitably
to befall us here, when they have vented their rage and malice there. All which
occasions so great a decay and stop of trade, that your Petioners are utterly
impoverished, and our miseries are grown unsupportable, we having already
spent all that little means which we had formerly by Gods blessing and our
great labor obtained; and many of us had not, nor can tell where to get bread
to sustain our selves and families; and others of us are almost arrived at the
same port of calamity, so that unless some speedy remedy be taken for the
removal of all such obstructions, which hinders the happy progress of your
great endeavors, your Petitioners shall not rest in quietness, but shall be
enforced to lay hold on the next remedy which is at hand, to remove the
disturbers of our peace, want, and necessity, breaking the bounds of modesty:
And rather then your Petitioners will suffer themselves and their families to
perish through hunger and misery, (though hitherto patiently groaned under)
they cannot leave any means unassayed for their relief.

The cry therefore of the poor and needy, your poor Petitioners, is that such
persons who are the obstacles of our peace, and hinderers of the happy
proceedings of this Parliament, and the enjoyment of the long looked for purity
of Religion, safety of our lives, and returns of our welfares, may be forth
with publicly declared, to the end they may be made manifest, the removal of
whom we humbly conceive will be a remedy to cure our miseries, and put a period
to these destractions, and that Noble-Worthies of the House of Peers, who
concur with you in your happy Votes, may be earnestly desired to join with
this Honorable House, and to sit and Vote as one entire body, which we hope
will remove from us our distracted fears, and prevent that which oppression
will make the wisest and peaceablest men to put in execution.

For the Lords sake hear us, and let our Religion, lives, and welfares, be
precious in Your sights, that the lines of the poor may bless You, and ever
pray, etc.

Printed for Will. Larner and T. B. this 31 of January, 1642. For the use of
the Petitioners who are to meet this present day in More Fields, and from
thence to go* to the house of Parliament with it in their hands.
