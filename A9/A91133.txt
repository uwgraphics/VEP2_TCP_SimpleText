A LETTER SENT FROM Mr. ANTHONY PROVVSE, Minister of Gods word at SHASTON, in
Summerset-shiere to a Friend in LONDON, August 8. 1642.
SIR,
I Have often received news from you I do now exchange, the news is past
with us, this week you have heard I believe how Marquess Hartford came this
week to Summerset for the Array, it began on Monday last at Wells, the place
of the Rendevous, there came 800. Troopers bravely horst from the Lord Pawlet,
Lord Digby, Lord Cottington, Sir John Strell, Sir R^lph Hopton, and other
Knights and Gentlemen in that County, and others for that service, and at the
first took away all the Ammunition that the troops brought with them. On
thursday last the troopers rangeing from place to place, to bring in all
Companies that might assemble to annoy them, meet with 500. Soldiers coming
from Bridgewaters side with Colonel Pine, the Parliement man, and were
surprised by Lunsford, who by an ambush slew two of the Company, hurt 16. more,
and routed that company, and took their Arms, and the Captain Preston took
quarter, and was brought to Wells; But this Friday there are above 15000. well
appointed men assembled on Mendipp for King and Parliament, and have taken the
Hill adjoining to Wells, where they have planted their Cannons, and have the
Town at command, and there are 20000. more speedy to come, and coming from
all parts of Sommersetshiere: Glouc. Wilts, Devon. and Wales, insomuch that the
Marquess with all his Royallists the chief of those parts are now in fears,
and this day are endeavoring to get away, and we all believe they will steal
away in the night, for they are threatened to be brought to the Parliament, what
I write you I have from sure hands, who were present at this.

If you meet Sir Walter Earl suddenly, I pray you acquaint him with what I
write

Dated Shaston 8. August. A. Prowse.
