A Warning, or, A word of Advice to the City OF LONDON, And to the whole
Kingdom OF ENGLAND, concerning the Armies Intentions and Actions;

BY Him who is a Lover of Righteousness and Peace; and at present a member of
the Army, very Useful and Considerable.

Printed at London for Giles Calvert near Ludgate, 1648.

A Word of Advice to the City of LONDON, and to the whole Kingdom of England,
concerning the Armies intentions and actions by him who is a lover of
Righteousness and Peace, and at present a member of the Army; very useful and
considerable.
OH the City of London, and the Kingdom of England! What mercies have thou
enjoyed, or rather, what mercy have you not both abused: How may thy friends
and true lovers stand weeping over thee, and saying, Oh the great
metropolitaine City, the Kingdom of England, had thou known the things
which belong to thy peace; but now they are hid from thine eyes, I say, had
thou known, thou had not necessitated an Army, (which generally has used to
be furthest from Righteousness, Justice and equity) to do that for thee
which thou thy self should have looked after: oh thou great City, thy
sins are many, thy provocations great, thy temptations increasing within
thee, to oppose thine own good, thine own peace.

And now I shall tell thee, that the Armies intentions, art and their actions
will be for thine and the Kingdoms good, peace, welfare, be you but passive,
seeing that through your neglect, if not contrary activenesse, you have
compelled them to be active; they intend not your trouble, impoverishing, or
ruin: but first, that Justice may be impartially administered without respect
of persons, without which they judge there can be no establishment either of
righteousness or true and lasting peace, that which your selves long after,
and be ye assured, its not the plunder of your City, nor the decay or decrease
of your trade that is intended: but rather that you might be settled in a more
free way of liberty in your tradings,

Secondly, That this way be effected, viz. the execution of Justice, they
intend only to question those both in Parliament and City, which have been the
obstructours of it, that so they may be expunged from any farther power, in
betraying their trust, as of late, in wheeling round so fast into an unity
with those whom formerly they opposed, as the great occasioners of our trouble
and miseries.

Thirdly, That by this means the Justice of God may be taken off the Kingdom,
which is not like to be, until justice be executed; for God is a just God and
will make inquisition for blood; and blood cries for blood, and its far better
justice take hold of a few, if God so please, then of many thousands as must be
expected, if justice be not executed; for believe it, the way of the Treaty is
the high way of ruin even to those who cry it up, work it and manage it, and
you will find the Army to be in the hands of God, your saviors in delivering
you from it. This is that others see, although you see it not: and that which
you cry up as the only way of Peace and Liberty, others see it to be the high
way of bondage and ruin; give them therefore Liberty to save you with fear
pulling you out of the fire, etc.

Fourthly, That they might once see this poor bleeding and dying Kingdom
delivered from its oppressions and burdens, and established in its just Rights
and Freedoms; and this is that which God will effect, whatever shall say him
nay, although at present to many, the remedy seems worse then the disease, yet
the end shall be glorious.

Object. But perhaps you will say, this is that which belongs to the Parliament
and we are to look to them; and to acquies in what they do, they being chosen
for that end.

Answ. Its true, it properly belongs to them indeed, but they betraying their
trust in making peace with men of blood, contrary to Law and Religion, contrary
to the Law of Nature or of God; they are to be questioned by those for whom
they are employed: For if we will allow of Arbitrary Will and Power in the
Parliament, as good in the King; as good an unlimitted power were in the hands
of one, as of many; for this is a truth confessed by all, that the Parliament are
servants of State unto the People, and I hope the servant may be questioned by
his Master if he betray his Trust and that wilfully too, as a great part of
this Parliament has done, in Voting and carrying on a Treaty of Peace with the
Enemies of Peace, and that not only ignorantly but wilfully, contrary to the
minds of those who trusted them, as appears in their rejecting of all
Petitions from all Counties who Petitioned them the contrary: and secondly, in
their not freeing the Kingdom from burdens, but rather increasing of them.

Object. But those Petitions came not from the major party in the City and
Counties to the Parliament.

Answ. True, for the major party are such as have betrayed their interest in
the Parliament, in fighting against them, and are not to have any Vote in the
choice of them; and so are not to be looked upon as within the liberty of
propounding grievances, or judging the actions of those whose ruin they have
so long d^sired: they are capable to receive government from them, but not
govern or vote in governing; therefore the Parliament is proper to the honest
well affected party that have stood by them and with them in all difficulties,
and they it is, who are called to have an eye to their Parliaments proceedings,
and they it is who have Petitioned their Parliament time after time, but could
not be heard; and now their eyes are greatly upon the Army, waiting what God
will do by the Army for them, the Army being the Kingdoms servants as well as
the Parliament, the Army being in the hands of God, the only visible power in
and of the Kingdom, by whom the enemy is subdued, upon whom the eyes of all
those who expect Righteousness and Justice are for the accomplishment of it;
and therefore I must tell you that if the Army should altogether be silent,
they should likewise be perfideous and traitors to that trust reposed in them,
betraying both the Lives and Liberties of themselves and friends into the hands
of implacable and murtherous men.

Secondly, I answer, that the Army is very tender of a Parliamentary power and
intend not to act things themselves, but to see those who have betrayed their
trust purged forth, that so there may be a free course of Justice in a lawful
Parliamentary way.

Object. But its reported that the Army are Levellers, and intend to make all
things common.

Answ. Its very false and untrue raised by those who are enemies to truth and
peace, its true they desire to level all powers which are contrary to and
against God: and this is that assure your selves the great God will bear them
out in, for its God indeed who is the great leveller both within and without
his people; and who art thou O great mountain that will stand up before him,
thou shall be made plain.

Object. But there is not unity in the Army in their proceedings, they are much
divided amongst themselves.

Answ. That is likewise an untruth, for God has powered down a mighty spirit of
unity and courage amongst them that as one man they are united for the common
good, and this I must tell you likewise that God has not only given them that
spirit of unity but a spirit of prayer and faith likewise, believing a
deliverance before they engage they are in good earnest, a praying, a believing
people, therefore I shall now proceed to a word of advice unto you and that
first be advised how you entertain thoughts of opposition and so of the
beginning of another War in England, and that for these reasons first before
if you oppose you will have the great God against you: second, then be sure you
shall fall before him for he is able, and will dash you to pieces like a potters
vessel, it is neither multitudes nor tumults can save before him.

2 According to principles of reason, you of all people in the Kingdom declare
your folly and weakness: if you should begin a tumult, for be sure if ever you
strike stroke you are undone; if not by the Army, yet have you not so much
wisdom as to fore; see that there are those amongst your selves who wait for
a pray to be enriched in your fall; O London, London, do thou not yet know
what belongs to thy peace; shall it be hid from thine eyes or will thou not do
good, nor suffer good to be done, mine eye and my heart pittieth thee, if thou will work out thine own ruin,

3 And be you therefore advised as you tender the safety of your Persons,
Estates, Trading, the Peace of the Kingdom, the honor of the great Jehovah
that you oppose not his work in hand, lest you perish in your way, for who is
he that shall stand before him; I must tell you that God has a dispensation of
righteousness to bring forth in the work and he will effect it though all the
world say-him nay; and he will make his people his batle and weapon of War, by
whom he will break all that shall oppose him; have you not seen God breaking
to pieces great and mighty powers by them, O when will you see that its God
fights our batles for us and delivers enemies into our hands; take heed how you
are found fighters against God.

4 Consider you have for the most part all the godly people in this Kingdom,
as one in this act, and as one against you, if you oppose and they are the
great interest of the Kingdom; for first, they are a praying people, secondly,
they are a believing people: thirdly they are made a courageous fighting
people, and then with them you will have their God and Father to be against
you, in a word you will have all the powers of Heaven against you, and nothing
but the powers of darkness and confusion to be for you.

5. And finally be you sure to perish in any design you undertake against them
for there is neither pollisie nor power against them, God undermines it all and
brings it to nothing Faith is given in already in this particular, and that
which I have said to the City, I say to the whole Kingdom of England: be not
perverse seek not to raise new troubles be at the least passive, suffer good
when it comes for all that oppose must be led forth with the workers of
iniquity into confusion and misery: God will punish them with astonishment and
madness, and will recompense unto them the fruit of their own ways: thus
have I very briefly and that with much bowels and tenderness, given you this
word of warning, that if God so please thy ruin may be prevented, but if you
will not hear my soul shall weep in secre^ for thy pride; yet know that thou
have had a word of warning from him who foresees both thy sin and misery; and
if notwithstanding this thou will be rebellious and oppose the work of the
great Jehovah, and so perish in thy opposition, thy Destruction is of thy self
and thy Judgment will be the more just: hearken not to flatterers neither
flatter thy self, it will be to late to repent when the judgment is past:
consider that thou thy self by thy clamourous petitions to the Parliament,
have been the cause of this approaching storm, add not therefore sin to sin,
but repent and amend look not at dishonor in thy submitting, beter be
dishonorable in receiving good then honorable in opposing it: better be
dishonorable in being passive in receaving them: to lose al in opposing, and
your greatest honor now at least will be to conquer lust and pride; before you
are conquered for your pride, you know what sad doomes have been past upon you
by many, I cannot yet say that is past upon you by God; I desire the Lord to
deliver you from that fiery destruction threatened, therefore have I written
that you might be prevented from working out your one ruin that so you might
have peace

FINIS.
