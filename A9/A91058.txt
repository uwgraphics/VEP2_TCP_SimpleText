The Profession of the Church of (...) in cheerful conjunction with many other
neighbor Churches, who in order to further Reformation and exercise of
CHRIST'S Discipline, have all agreed in the same Profession.
THE PREFACE.
SEeing the sincere making and keeping our Covenant with God in Christ is a
chief part of the Christian Religion, and a matter of Absolute Necessity to our
Salvation; and the proneness of our sinful hearts to unfaithfullness and
Backsliding, does require us often to Renew our Resolutions and Covenants; and
the Word of God, and example of the Churches, do encourage us hereto;
especially at the Restoring or Reforming of a Church which has fallen into
Confusion, Ignorance, Error or Profaneness, which is too much the Case of us
and too many Congregations in England; And because Ministers cannot well know
who are members of the Churches, and who not, and so must be Ignorant of the
extent of their Charges and Duties, without an expression of their Peoples
Consent; and for want of this Ministers are at such Uncertainties, and Churches
in such disorder, and the Duties of Pastors and People so Defectively
performed; whereby many being offended have been occasioned to separate,
supposing our Churches to have been no true Churches, nor our Ministers true
Ministers, for want of a more express Consent and Combination. And seeing the
Pastors cannot with any probability of success, or without great offense to the
People, perform those Acts of Teaching and Ruling which Christ has made the
Work of their Office, without the Peoples express Consent (though the sign it
self be not particularly determined.) To the end therefore that we may be the
faster tied to Christ and one another, and may more Faithfully discharge our
mutual Duties; and this Church may be more Reformed, and the Discipline of
Christ be more faithfully and successfully exercised, and that none may have
just cause to take themselves injured thereby, and that no more may take
occasion of separation and division from us: We whose Names are afterwritten
(as in the presence of God who searches the heart, and will severely judge
those that are false in his Covenant,) do seriously, upon deliberation, and in
the fear of Almighty God, make this solemn Profession of our Belief and
Resolution.

THE PROFESSION.
I Believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth: And in Jesus
Christ his only Son our Lord, which was conceived by the holy Ghost; born of
the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was Crucified Dead and Buried,
he descended into Hell; The third day he rose again from the dead: He ascended
into Heaven, and sits on the right hand of God the Father Almighty, from
thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the holy
Ghost, the holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of
sins, the Resurrection of the body, and the Life Eversting, Amen.I Believe that

MATH. 28.18, 19, 20. All power is Given to me in Heaven and in Earth: Go ye
therefore and Disciple all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you always even unto the end
of the world. Amen.

HEB. 13.17. HEB. 10.24, 25. ROMANS 15.6. Obey them that have the Rule over you,
and submit your selves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give
account; that they may do it with joy and not with grief; for that is
unprofitable for you. And let us consider one another, to provoke unto Love and
to Good Works: Not forsaking the Assembling of our selves together, as the
manner of some is; but exhorting one another. That ye may with One mind and
One mouth glorify God even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

ACTS 20.28, 29, 30, 31. Take heed therefore unto your selves, and to All the
flock over the which the holy Ghost has made you Overseers; to feed the Church
of God which he has purchased with his own blood. For I know this, that after
my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
Also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away
Disciples after them. Therefore watch.

ISA. 44.3, 4, 5. For I will pour water on him that is thirsty, and floods upon
the dry ground: I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my Blessing upon thine
offspring: And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willowes by the
watercourse. One shall say [I am the Lords,] and another shall call himself
by the Name of Jacob: and another shall Subscribe with his hand unto the Lord,
and surname himself by the name of Israel.
