THE REMONSTRANCE OF THE Knights, Gentlemen, and Freeholders of the County of
GLOUCESTER.
WE do claim and avow it to be our undoubted Birthright and Liberty, That no
new Laws, much less any new Government, can, or ought to be imposed upon us;
nor any Taxes, Contributions, or Free Quarter taken of us without the Consent
of the People of this Nation in a Free-Parliament Assembled; which Liberties
have been often confirmed to us by the Great Charter, the Petition of Right,
and many other Statutes; and Parliaments being the only Bulwark and defense of
our Liberties, as men and Christians ought to be, freely elected and to sit and
vote without interruption or opposition by any persons whatsoever: The
Privileges whereof we are all bound to maintain and defend, and to assist and
maintain each other in the defense thereof. And therefore we resolve, according
to our bounden duty, to join with the Lord Mayor and Common Council of the
City of LONDON, and all other Counties in ENGLAND in pursuance thereof. And we
do not doubt but all true-hearted Englishmen who love their own Liberties, and
are not willing to be made Slaves, or to inslave their Brethren, will join with
us herein.
