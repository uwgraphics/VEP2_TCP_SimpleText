A LETTER SENT OVT OF Ireland from the right Honorable Earl of ORMOND and
OSSORY, To his much Honored Uncle, Sr. ROBERT POYNTZ, Showing the true estate
of the Kingdom of Ireland at this present time, and delivered to his Uncle
here, the 21, of June, 1642.
THE last Letter I received from you was of the 7th of April, by one Veele, to
whom I shall be very ready to give my assistance toward his preferment, when I
have rid my self of a few former engagements. We are now in so good condition
for matter of men, that I know it will be wondered that we do no more with them;
but when it shall be considered what men without Money, Meat, or Clothes, are
able to do, I hope we shall not be taxed with sloth, having by many winter, and
uncomfortable journies, manifested our unwillingnesse to lie still; it is true
that our want of money, was then as great as now, but then the Hagards Barnes,
and Houses, were full of all manner of provision, which now betwixt us, and the
Rebels are so wasted, that the most fertile Country affords nothing but
penury, and desolation, and the booty that heretofore gave edge to the
Soldiers, and made them endure indefatigably all manner of labor, is for a
great circuit about us, either already taken by our men, or removed into
inaccessable places by the Rebels; nor have we carriage (if there were plenty
of victual in the store) to convey it with us, forth of those limits already
wasted, if we march in such numbers as to considerable service; and on the
other side, if we lie still, and eat upon the Magazin, we shall very
sudainly wast it, so that unless there be a speedy supply of at least
victual, and cariages, this Army raised at so great charge to that Kingdom,
will be forced to dissolve or ruin of it self; I have given you this short,
and true account of the state we are in, because I hope you are at London,
where you may acquaint such of your friends as are of the Parliament with it,
as likewise that you might be able to say something in my excuse, in case the
blame of this dangerous loss of time should be laid on me; for though all this
be much fullier represented to the Commissioners, appointed for the management
of this War, from the Lords Justices, and Council, yet many may be apt to
censure me, that will not be called to the reading of that.

When I know you are at London, you shall hear often, and more particularly
from me, one Monday next I take a journey to Conaught, where I will endeavor to
do some service before our provision be quite gone, from thence you shall
hear from me, in the mean time I rest

Dublin the 10. of June 1642. Your most affectionate Nephew, and Servant,
ORMOND OSSORY.
