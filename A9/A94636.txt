To the Right Honorable the Lords of the Higher House of Parliament.
The humble Petition of many thousands of the Inhabitants of Norwich.
THe daily growing evils and almost desperate diseases which have overspread
the whole body of this Kingdom, both in Church and State, do pain us so sore
as members thereof, and fills us with such fears as that we can no longer
refrain from making the same known to your Honors. But showing that after we
had lien under a great burden in our Religion by a multitude of frivolous,
ridiculous and unwarranted Ceremonies, pressed with the vehemency of
suspencion, excommunication, and deprivation of many godly and painful
Ministers, vexing and grievously oppressing of great multitudes of others of
his Majesty's good subjects, so that they were enforced to fly the Kingdom, and
in our civil rights by a multitude of Monopolies, by the impositions of
illegal taxations, by illegal imprisonment, by oppressions and cruelties, in
censures of Courts of Justice, as if Government had been set free from
restraint of Laws, and as if that malignant party who were the authors thereof
(as we verily believe they did) intended the undermining and utter subversion
both of our Religion and Liberty all at once: We hoped upon the assembly of
this Parliament, thereby as the only means under God to have enjoyed a
perfect reformation in both, but finding the same as hitherto not perfected by
reason the causes of these our evils (as we conceive) are not removed, which
put us in fear of falling into a relapse more dangerous then in the first
disease. The Causers and Authors of all which evils are by the Remonstrance of
the House of Commons declared, to be the Jesuited Papists the Bishops, and
corrupt part of the Clergy, bad Counselors and Courtiers, and their late
practices do give us good cause to believe the same, as namely that hellish
damnable Rebellion, salvage and bloody cruelty of the Papists in Ireland, the
late Protestation of the Prelates in England, which did strike at the very
essence and being of Parliaments, and many other plots and designs which have
been lately discovered and attempted upon the Parliament, no less dangerous
then the former, the endeavors of some ill affected ones to set division
between the King and his people, and to render them odious to his Majesty, who
are his loyal and faithful Subjects. And that which now dampeth our spirits,
makes sad our hearts, takes away the life of our trading, breeds scarceness of
money, brings on such poverty as we can scarce keep the poor from mutiny, and
fills us with fears, such as hasten on apace even to desperation, and make
many people to mutter, and speak it out, that they account those persons
enemies to the State, who are oppugners of those good things which tend to the
general good and safety of the Land, is, the not proceeding to bring to
condign punishment the troublers of this our Israel, the not disarming of
Papists, and the execution of the Laws against them, and the Jesuits, of whose
perfidious treachery this Kingdom has had experience enough, and cannot be
strong until they be made weak; the delays of sending aid to the Protestants
in Ireland, whilst the Rebels increase their strength and ammunition from
foreign Nations, so that they begin to think for transporting themselves
hither, and make this Kingdom the seat of their war, for which neglect we may
justly fear the curse of Merous to befall us, the not putting of the Kingdom
into a posture of defense, placing the Castles, Forts, and Magazines of this
Kingdom into such hands as the King and Parliament may confide in, in these
times of eminent dangers, when such distractions are in the land, the Papists
and malignant party so exasperated, the Rebels in Ireland so strengthened,
such preparations for wars in foreign Nations, who emulate our Religion, and
that incitation which they have by the counsel of such delinquents, who have
fled from the Justice of this Kingdom, and intelligence of our distempers from
them who yet remain amongst us, the stopping of many good Laws tending to the
security of the Kingdom conceived by the House of Commons, not yet brought
forth, but stifled in the birth, and made abortive, notwithstanding the
uncessant and unwearied labors and endeavors of the renowned House of
Commons, who represent the persons of Us, and the rest of the Commons of this
Kingdom, who are truly sensible of our evils, as seeing with our eyes,
hearing with our ears, and acting with our hands, the maintenance of whose
warrantable actions and proceedings, in which the honor of the King, and the
safety of the kingdom consists, with our lives, estates and fortunes, we
account our selves bound by the Protestation by us lately taken, and shall be
ever ready thereunto.

We humbly desire your Honors will be pleased to join with the House of
Commons in the speedy redress of these present evils both in Church and
State, and in using effectual means for prevention of those which be eminent,
that a strong Navy, the walls of the Kingdom be provided, where our
adversaries may be disheartened, and we better strengthened for defense, that
the Votes of Popish Lords (who as we conceive hitherto) have been great
obstacles, may be removed, means may be used to his Majesty that he will be
pleased to return, that so his Royal Presence so often as need be, give life
to your endeavors, that the Locusts, the Vermin and Caterpillars of Egypt, who
have endeavored to devour our Religion, consume our Peace, and destroy the
good things of this Land, may with one blast of King and Parliament be
overthrown and drowned in the red Sea of Justice, and that Religion may be
established in the purity both of Doctrine and Discipline, so shall the Kings
Throne be established in peace, and the Land shall be at rest.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray for your Lordships, etc.
