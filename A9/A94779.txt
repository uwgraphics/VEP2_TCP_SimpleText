AN ODE Upon the Ninth of JANUARY 1693/4 THE FIRST SECULAR DAY SINCE THE
UNIVERSITY OF DUBLIN'S FOUNDATION BY QUEEN ELIZABETH.
By Mr. TATE.
GReat Parent Hail! all Hail to Thee,
Who have from last Distress survived,
To see this joyful Year arrived;
Thy Muses Second JUBILEE.
Another Century commencing
No Decay in Thee can trace;
Time with his own Laws dispencing,
Adds new Charms to every Grace,
That adorned thy Youthful Face.
After War's, Alarms repeated,
And a Circling Age completed,
Vigorous Offspring thou do raise;
Such as to JVVERNA's praise;
Shall LIFFEE make as proud a Name,
As that of ISIS or of CAME.
Awful Matron take thy Seat,
To Celebrate this Festival;
The Learned Assembly well to Treat
Blessed ELIZA's Days recall.
The Wonders of HER Reign recount
In Songs that Mortal Streins surmount:
Songs for PHAEBVS to repeat.
SHE was the first who did inspire,
And strung the mute HIBERNIAN Lyre;
Whose deathless Memory
(The Soul of Harmony)
Still animates the Vocal Quire.
Succeeding Princes next recite:
With never dying Verse require
Those Favors they did shower;
It Is that alone can do 'em right
To save 'em from Oblivion's Night
Is only in the Muses power.
But chiefly Recommend to Fame,
MARIA and Great WILLIAM's Name;
For surely no HIBERNIAN Muse
(Whose Isle to Him, Her freedom owes)
Can Her Restorer's Praise Refuse,
While BOYN or SHANON flows.
Thy Royal Patrons sung; Repair
To Illustrious ORMOND's Tomb:
As, Living, He made Thee His Care,
Give Him, next thy CAESAR'S, Room.
Then a Second ORMOND's Story
Let astonished Fame recite;
But she will wrong the Hero's Glory.
Till with equal Flame she write
To that which He displays in Fight.
CHORUS.
With Themes like these ye Sons of Art
Treat this Auspicious Day;
To Bribe the Minutes as they part,
Those Blessings to bequeath, that may
Long, long rem, ain Your Kindness to repay.
