Remarks on the Observations, OFFERED By a True Englishman, Who is not a
SAILOR, though of Long Service in the NAVY.
THE Title Demonstrates the Author to be no Englishman, or not to have
observed, That an English-Sailor, not Saile'r, writ that Paper, Reflecting (as
he terms it) on the Admiralty; but however he may have been Concerned; his
Carping at filthy Springs from impure Fountains, cannot justify the Admiralty
which he makes the Fountain; for as Omne Simile Claudicat, so does his
Comparison, that pure Waters lose their Virtues by the Channels they flow
through; except he would have the unalterable Orders, issued from that formerly
important Office, to be subjected to the imprudent or ill Management of those
Commissionated by it: This he may be assured of, the old Females of Wapping,
would not have suffered their Servants to commit Faults, without Reproof and
Punishment; whereas this Author would have the Commissioners of the Admiralty
to do so, And how justly the Seamen living there, complain of the
Commissioners of the Admiralties Dealings with them, the Author might be judge
of, would he hear them, which he knows the Lords of the Admiralty will not, to
the First's great Sorrow, and the Latters ever-lasting Infamy.

How ignorant soever we may be what King Solomon's Sea-Commanders might have
been, the Office of Lord High Admiral of England is well known, and has, in
the Memory of Man been well Executed, in Comparison of what has been in the
late War, or since the present Peace; and that the Mismanagements complained
of, have proceeded from the Qualifications of the Gentlemen that Compose that
Board, is but too evident; Witness the Breach of the Fundamental Constitution
of the English Government, in the Disobeying our most Gracious King's Commands,
signified by the Lord Duke of Shrewsbury, then Secretary of State, Ordering a
Squadron of Ships to be sent to meet Sir George Rooke, Returning from Cadiz; to
enable him to intercept the Thoulon-Fleet, under pretense of a Verbal
Contradictory Order. And how can any Fleet secure England, when it is under the
Command of those that did not punish Captain Norris, for not Attacking of
Poine^ when at Newfoundland, upon Captain Scomberbacks Intelligence, since they
thought fit to Reward the latter with Five hundred Pounds, and a Chain and
Medal. It is true, that the want of the Experience of such Manifest
Miscarriages as have happened in the Nine Years War may be happy for the
Nation, but except those that are known Guilty of them be punished for Example;
others, it is possible will unadvisedly fall into the same Errors.

It is not desired, That the Length of Service should be a reason to Displace
any Man in Office, but surely continued Disservice to their Country and Prince
calls for deserved Punishment, and then 'twould be easy to name a set of
Gentlemen that will Faithfully serve the Public, and render the Admiralty a
Renowned, not An unlucky Office, an Epethite no Englishman can give to it;
however, it may be given to those that Execute it, whose Services must be
forgotten, since not known, and their Crimes ought to be remembered, since they
are so evident, and plainly proved every Day.

The Hardships done to the Seamen in Turning them over from one Ship to
another, I dare boldly affirm has been the occasion of our want of Men; and
without a greater Regard be had to do them Justice, both in Pay and Treatment,
the Number of the Disobliged must Increase; and who does not wish Ease and
Advantage to the Seamen, can be no Friend to the Government.

Lastly, Let the Cruising Captains, in the time of our Grand Fleets being in
the Streights be asked, How they were provided with Wine, and it will appear
the Sailors drank Water, without ever having their due Allowance for the Wine
they should have had, which can be proved; though I suppose the Author of the
Observations is ignorant thereof.
