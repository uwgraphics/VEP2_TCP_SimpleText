To the truly Honored Sir THOMAS ALEYN Knight, Lord Mayor of the City of

MY LORD,
I Had the Honor to serve you in the Celebration of your Companies love, the
29th. of October last, and from thence derive a boldness to present you with
the Epitome of this days Business. My Lord, As your Loyalty has been great,
your Joy cannot be little, nor your Happiness less; That the Hand of Providence
in the time of your Magistracy, should restore Our most gracious and undoubted
SOVEREIGN to his just (though long deprived Rights:) This being committed to
Chronicle, must necessarily render you Eminent to Posterity, and make your
Honor firm, which before was subject to be blown away by the breath of Malice
and Detraction. Pardon the presumption (my Lord) if I subscribe my self

To the READER.
READER,
I Have omitted some passages, in regard they might have proved too tedious,
and my time was limited. If it want Illustration, excuse the Surprisall, which
as it was sudden, took me unprepared: But I confess I am highly obliged to a
person of worth for his Notes, of whom I likewise beg pardon, if I have
digress'd in any thing.

TIME's SPEECH.
Most Sacred Sir,
[Kneels.] TIme on his bended knee your Pardon Craves,
Having been made a Property to Slaves;
A Stalking-horse unto their horrid Crimes,
Yet when things went not well the fault was Times.
My Fore-top held by Violence not Right,
Died the Suns Cheeks with blood, defiled the Light:
That all Men thought they eased their misery
If they could but Securely rail on me.
These Clamours troubled Time, who straight grew sick
With Discontents, as Touched unto the Quick;
And so far spent 'twas thought he could not mend,
Rather grow worse and worse; All wished his End.
Nay, was concluded dead, and worst of all
With many a Curse they Peal'd his Funeral.
Now see the Change, Since Your arrival here
Time is Revived, and nothing thought too dear
That is Consumed upon him, never was he
So Iov'd and prayed for since his Infancy.
Such is the Vertual Fervor of your Beams,
That not Obliquely but directly Streams
Upon your Subjects; So the Glorious Sun
Gives growth to the infant Plants he smiles upon.
Welcome Great Sir unto your Peoples Love
Who breath their very Souls forth as You move.
Their long and tedious Sufferings do expres
'Till now they never had Sense of Blessedness.
The Cheer'd-up-Citizens cease to Complain,
Having Received their Cordial Sovereign.
Among the Rest the Skinners Company
Crowd to express their Sense of Loyalty
And those born deaf and dumb and can can but see
Make their hands speak Long live Your Majesty:
Whose Royal Presence cures the Wounded State
Re-guilds Times Coat, and gives a turn to Fate.

TRVTH's SPEECH.
Most gracious Sovereign,
[Kneels.] BOund by allegiance, Truth, Daughter to Time
(Long since abused) Welcomes you to this Clime,
Your Native Soil, to which you have been long
A Stranger; Now Truth should not want a Tongue,
Although she has been Murdered by Report
She Is now Camp-Royal and Attends your Court;
And as in Rules of Strict Divinity,
He that desires the Judges Clemency,
Must first Condemn himself, and so prepare
His way for Pardon, it is your Kingdoms Care;
Who do confess whilst other Nations strove
Which should be happiest in your Princely love,
Were so insensible of that blessed heat
A Pulse they wanted Loyalty to beat;
With Penitential tears they meet your Palm
Showing a Loyal Tempest in a Calm.
Then from your Rays of Majesty they do
Derive such Joy speaks no less Wonder too,
Children that hardly heard of such a thing
Now frequently do cry God bless the King.
Nay though their damned Sires instructed them
To hate the Cask'net yet they will love the Jem;
Such is your Radices that you Refine
Sublunar things to Species more divine.
You have new Coined all hearts, and there Impressed,
Your Image which gives Vigor to the rest
Of their late stupid faculties that now,
They Will pass for Current, and true Subjects grow:
The untainted Clothiers Company by me
Their Instrument, pray for your Majesty;
May you live long and happy, and Increase,
For ever Crown the harvest of your peace;
Since graciously you have deceived Our fears,
Instead of Wars brought Music of the spheres.

FAME's SPEECH.
Most Mighty Sir,
[Kneels.] FAme, that never left you at the worst Essay,
Welcomes you home, and Glorifies this day:
You whose blessed Innocence and matchless Mind
Could never be stained or any ways Confined,
Has stood the Shock of Fortunes utmost hate
And yet your Courage did Outdare your Fate;
That even those Fiends (for sure none else could be
Your Enemies) admired Your Constancy;
Commending that they most did Envy, so
Against their Wills your Fame did Greater grow:
And when those Miscreants against you did prepare,
And thought You Sure, Your wisdom broke the snare.
'Twas strange that through the cloud none could descry
A Spark of that fullness of Majesty.
But Heaven that Orders all things as it list
Shut up their Eyes in an Egyptian Mist.
You have past many Labyrinths, are Returned
Now to Your People who long time have Mourned;
The want of Your warm Beams they have not known,
A Summer since your Father left his Throne;
That like the benumbed Muscovians they now run,
With eager have to meet their Rising Sun;
And if the Rout in Uproar chance to be,
It cannot be Judged but Loyal Mutiny;
Since that You do their Golden Times Revive,
They to express a Joyful Salve strive;
Blessed Prince thrice Welcome is the general Cry,
And in that speaks the Grocers Company;
To which the present Mayor a Brother is,
Whose Loyalty finds happiness in this,
This Royal Change, Fame now shall spread his Wing,
And of your after Glories further sing;
Since in Your self You are a History
A Volume bound up for Eternity.
