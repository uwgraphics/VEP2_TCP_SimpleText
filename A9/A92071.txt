the Poor, Naked, Hunger-sterv'd English, sent out of Ireland into England. THE
SECOND, Concerning Tolleration of Religion in Ireland.

THE FIRST SPEECH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, concerning a contribution for the
Poor, Naked, Hunger-sterv'd English, sent out of Ireland into England.
Mr. SPEAKER,
THis Day is appointed for a charitable work, a work of bowels and
compassion: I pray God, we may never have the like occasion, to move, to
stir up our charity.

These miserable people, are made so, because of their Religion. He that will
not suffer for his Religion, is not worthy to be saved by it: and he is
unworthy thy to enjoy it, that will not releeve those that suffer for it.

I did know but the last year here in England, some (and they no Papists) who
were resolved to make Ireland their retreat, as the safer Kingdom of the two.

We do now see a great, a dismal Change, God knows whose turn shall be
next, it is wrapped up in his Providence. That which happens to one Country,
may happen to any. Time and Chance comes upon all, though guided by a certain
hand.

The right way to make a man truly sensible of an others calamity, is, To
think himself into the same case and condition, and then to do as he would
be done unto.

Wherefore, Master Speaker, Let our Gift be a matter of Bounty, not of
Covetousness, that it may abound to our account in the day of reckoning. He
that lowes plentifully, shall reap plentifully. I am sure, He that lends to
the Lord has the best security, and cannot be a looser. (...)
