To the Reader.
THe innumerable tortures wherewith severe censures will torment and whip me,
their pewes, their pyshes, their wrye looks, Apish iestures, and untunable
pronuntiations, have not so much retained me any time this halfe-score years
from the publication of this moral History, as the imputations of arrogancy
immitation, affectation, and even absurd ignorance, which I ever feared Envy
would unjustly lay upon me: but having by custom, and the weakness of
detraction loosed my self from such shadowie fetters, and with a more airie
spirit freed my soul from such insubstantiall fears, I have adventured to
cast into the world this Orphan, which how-euer it was once begot by noble
parents, and bosomed in the most celestial ears that ever was worthy to
retain noble mysteries, is now like a vagabond inforst to beg, and live upon
miserable charity: yet for virtues sake, whom I ever desire to satisfy with
my best powers, before I, be araignd at the bar of bitterness, I am willing
to make this defense for the crimes which cruelty may suggest against me.
First for the Title, though it be only excellent in the most excellent creature
that first taught us the sound of excellent writing, yet has it likewise been
used by others in sundry pamphlets, without either pride or ostentation, men
taking liberty to lay their hystories in Countries by them most affected: next
for mine allusion and imitation, which bears a color of much greater
vain-glorie: mine excuse must only be the worthiness of former presidents,
as Virgill from Homer, Ariosto from Baiardo, famous Spencer from renowned
Chaucer, and I with as good privilege, from the only to be admired Sir Philip
Sydney, whose like, though never age has or shall present to memory, yet
shall it be renown to the meanest that endeavor to live by the crummes of his
Table: who were our age but blessed with his living breath, he would himself
confess the honey he drew both from Heliodorus, and Diana. For other faults I
must answer with Master France, if there were a bond to compel men to read,
there should then be an authority likewise, to bind us that write, to delight:
But since both have free will, my counsel is to read no longer then till your
appetite be either cloyed, or filled, and so by preservation of your stomachs,
make them apt to taste others better labors: to which, and to your own
content I commit you.

THE FIRST PART OF THE FIRST BOOK of the Moral English Arcadia, alluding his
beginning from Sir Philip Sidneyes ending.
AT such time as the flowers appearing upon the earth, had summoned the ayrie
quiristers to entertain the first Ambassadors of the Spring, and that Nature
(delivered from the barraine womb of Winter) had showed her self lyuelie as
the morning, fair as the nights Gouernesse, pure as the Sun, and as
almighty as an army of invincible fortune: The unhappy and forlorn Shepherd
Credulo being come to the foot of the mountain Tagetus, from whose large
distributed skirts, ran an even and well leuiled plain, through which the
siluer-flowing Erimanthus had made many curious and enterchangeable windinges,
till she delivered the abundance of her tribute into the bosom of the Ocea^s
unruly treasury: and being arrived at the utmost of the earths prospecte, he
encountered with his companion (both in fortunes and desires) the forsaken
Carino, whose eyes (long before that time drowned in their own tears) were
now over early awaked to bathe themselves in the tearye sea of others more
dear afflictions: And being met in that alone loneliness (which extremest
of all miseries had chosen out as a plat-forme whereon to build that day a
stage for an immortal Tragedy) they sat down, and casting their eyes upon
the waves (whose vast solitarines presented to their minds the lively Idaeas
of their unaccompanied lamentations) began bitterly to complain, that having
ouer-laden hearts, broke and divided with complaints (which by incessant
bemoanings they sought howerly to disburden) found neither ease nor respet, but
rather a more augmentation of their continual childbearing mischiefs:
where-upon Credulo commenting in the sadness of his countenance, more large
volumes of grief then his weak tongue could deliver, thus spoke:

Ah Carino (said he) hither are we come to behold not the last act (though as
bleedingly pitious as the latest can be) of Infortunes worst Tragedy,
presented to the stony eyes of creatures insensible, because barbarous: and
acted by the greatest Beauty that ever before this day arose in the sky of
any woman's countenance: Alas that misery should be so Imperious, as to dare
to take possession in the Palace of Virtue; or virtue so fearful, as for any
disaster in-fortune, to forgo the habitation of Beauty: Will the Almighty
Justice in his Divine providence create excellent frames to ignoble uses? or
Nature spend the golden treasure of her workma^ship, in a receptacle for
greatest imperfections? It is impossible, it is impossible!

The Arts-masters of this low rounds nations, strive in their works exquisite,
to portrait their own virtues; the best of which endeavors remain after them,
living remembrances of dead worthiness: And shall the master of them, and their
knowledges, make his goodliest pyramed, a monument for vnblushing shamefulnes?
it is too preposterous to imagine, and irreligious to believe; only to thee and
me (whose care-consumed imaginations direct all their leuells against the
mark of misfortunes, as having our hopes given over into the hands of
Disdain, our vows inrespected; our loves fruitles, our torments pittiles, and
our deaths Tomblesse) to us I say these accidents of inhumane adversity, are
but awaking thunders, or Night-Rauen cries to our laboring reme^brances,
drawing in them and before them, the models of those mishappes wherewith our
own souls are attainted. How often have thou and I (my Carino) from the top of
yon Mountain sent our eyes with the imbassage of our hearts, conueying in
blood-drawing sighs, (speedy messengers of despair) the occurrents of our
dying hopes? How often upon this Plain have we in dark Eglogues discoursed the
pure intent of our honest services? How often upon these Sands have we wrtten
her name with our Sheep-hookes, which the jealous Sea in love with, has
greedily snacht into his bosom? And how often from yon aspiring Rock have we
wished (so she would bear witness to our wish) to fall headlong into the Sea, as
a seal to the great deed of our enduring affection, and yet have found neither
hope in our desires, comfort in our loves, nor end in our dispaires? Have we at
any time desisted from the violence of our first passion? Has there ever been
seen coolness in the burning Fever of our desires? Have our minds slept at
all in the shade of a reputed oblivion? Or has the History of her praises at
any time found an end in our speeches? the gods forbid. O Cinthia, Cinthia,
our Fields Garland, our Winters spring, our Sommets shade, our Haruests fruit,
and the living cause of all Creatures happy livings be thine eyes the witnesses
of our vows, and our own deeds the test moneys of our faithes: be thine
admiration as great as our loves, for our loves shall be as boundles as the
infinite world of thy perfections: Continue the miracle of time, as thou art
the wonder amongst women; that when Envy after this day shall boast Queen
Hellen of Corinth was virtue, yet thy virtue succeeding all ages, may still
ingraft (in remembrance) an enduring and vnblotted excellence.

Here an extreme violence to speak much in the praises of divine Cinthia
(whom with equal ardor they both most sincerely adored) over came the power of
much speaking, and with dumb Oratorie converted his language to dumbness;
whilst Carino thus replied.

What needs (my Credulo said he) this indictment against the hope of our
contentment, whose desperate resolution long since has pleaded guilty before
the greatest judge of our Fortunes? To reckon our cares, were to number the
stars: to measure our loves, were to make a circle greater then the greatest
either is or can be: and to unlade our affectionate desires, were by
spoonfulls to convey the Sea into some contrary Channel: what they are we
feel, and when they shall determine, the all-seeing all-thinges only has
knowledge: as easy can the Sun be removed from his diurnall passage, as our
thoughts from her remembrance, or our hearts from the love of her virtues: Have
not we succeeded both in our loves and admirations, the truly loving Strephon
and Claius whose enduring constancies, and forlorn indurances, heaued their
Urania beyond the degree of superlatiue? And is there likelihood we will either
seek the abridgement of our woes (which is the badge of our sufferance) or the
end of our love (which is the heaven of our cogitations) no, no my Credulo, it
was Virtue that brought forth wonder, wonder knowledge, knowledge love, and
love the eternity of our never to be slain affection: Be then the world by us
filled full of the praises of divine Cinthia, and every Mothers child taught to
adore the Star can lead to so heavenly perfections. But whether are we
carried with the force of her remembrance, and the violence of our own duties?
arose we thus early for this? came we to complain to the Ocean for this?
wette we our vn-dride cheeks with new tears for this? or are our moanes
senseless to all be moanings but this only? Indeed as every place is for
orname^t beholding to this subject; so is this subject indebted to every place
for a grateful relenting, and enticing acceptance. But we came as I remember,
to remember that being the Vassails, and bo^dslaues to Beauty; we owe some rent
of grief to the overthrow of a rare Beauty. Ah Hellen, fair Hellen, unhappily
happy in thy fairenes, who having all the possible means of allureme^ts in thy
perfections, find nothing but impossibillities in attaining the meanest of
thy wishes! thou art unhappy, thou art unhappy.

And as he would have further pursued the agony of his passion, which even then
Credulo was ready to second with an host of most bleeding arguments; they were
both interrupted with an extraordinary noise (full of terror and amazement)
which to the first apprehension, they imagined to be a peale of Thunder,
running post before the violence of an ensuing storm: But more consideratly
beholding the marble cleernes of the well disposed sky; and attentively
hearing the continuance of the former rumor; they found the error of that
conceit; whereupon comparing with the suruay of their eyes, (cast upon every
adjoined object) the hollownes of the sound, and hard distinguishment of the
clamors, both which gave testimony of a far coming exclamation: they cast
their sightes to the Sea-ward, even so far as the division of the air would
give limitte to their seeing; and at the furthest end of that prospect, they
might perceive like a small duskie cloud rising from the water, which by little
and little creeping more near the leuel of their judgments, they saw increase
both in quantity and affright to their eyes (unaccustomed to such spectacles)
for as if Jove and Neptune had been in combat for their birth-rightes, either
striving with the predominant qualities of his kingdom to annoy each others
habitation; so might one see through the clouds-thicknes, flames of fire
dancing upon the waters, and immediately mountains of water rise up to sport
with those fires: there was to be seen by the eye of imagination, a combat
without weapons, yet many times weapons and no combat: a fear without
danger, yet more danger then fear could comprehend: at last what with the
help of the winds, which coming from the Sea-ward, blew directly (with a
recoyling force) against the shore, they might plainly discern a Galley and a
Gallioon, like an Eliphant and a Serpent grapled together in an austere and
reuengefull contention; the fury of the fight augmenting with the continuance
of the fight, as if strength were to be-gotten by strokes, or freshnes by
weariness; so power-full were the hands of those actors, and so pure the
spirits which then commanded the use of such hands: But amongst the rest,
and above all that then were without rest, they might perceive two, in whom as
it seemed a vindicatiue resolution, had made them the wrathful ministers of an
inexpiable malice: so the manner of exercising, attested an incomparable virtue
both in the dexterity of their valors, and in the vnamazed pursuit of their
reuenges satisfaction: for as it seemed, they two contended against all, or all
sought the ouer-throwe of those two: many hands being erected against one
head; and yet many heads cut off by one hand. This fight continued in the view
of the Sheapheards by the space of two hours, with no less terror to them
(who armed with so spacious a distance as might give assurance from any
assailement, had notwithstanding through their eyes received the wound of fear
upon their hearts) then repentant sorrow in those that underwent the revenge
of so haughty courages: But by and by they saw the Ships which till then had
as it were kissed one an other, and hung together by an unfriendly and boystrous
imbracement, disseuer themselves, and the Gally, what with the force of her
Oars, and a little help of a quarter wind which breathed upon her Sails,
made her way directly forth into the Sea, with such eagerness of speed, as
many times we see a Pirate when he has in chase a rich and well laden
home-returning Merchant; but contrary to that, the Gallyoon with all the
canuasse she could put forth, boar before the wind as even upon the shore as
might be imagined, yet might they still behold (as long as the virtue of their
sightes could hold the knowledge of any object) one of the forenoted Champions
in the Gally, not only continue, but in more mortal and desperate manner;
continue the unspeakable bloudines of the first combat, till the length or
distance had deprived their eyes of that spectacle: The other in the Gallioon
with no less but rather a more inauspitious hand of death over his
incou^terers, by how much more near he grew unto the judgments of the
beholders, augmented both his own rage, and their opinions touching the
excellency of his rage; distributing such vnresistaable blows, that his sword
was seen sildom or never fall with his hand, but a body divided from a soul
fell dead at his foot; so that as it was most likely to be imagined the poor
in-habitants of that vessel, grown to the desperate wilfulness of absolute
desperatenes (which is by death to shun death) wilfully ran the ship against
the Rocks, whose armed breast of too hie proof for so slender timber, split her
in one instant into many thousand disioyned pieces; the suruiuing remnant more
willingly offering up their lives into the hands of the merciless Sea, whose
mercy they had not tasted; then to the subjection of his sword, whose vigor in
punishing their breathles companions bodies, in their floating witnessed. But
neither did the daring of their dispaires (which was the unexpected entrance to
this evil, neither the danger it self (wherein the preciousnes of his dear
life was imballanced) neither the inacquaintance of the soil whereon he was
ship-wrackt, neither his many wounds, the loss of Fortune, Hope, Honor,
Wealth, or other expectation breed in him either amazement, fear, or
desistance from the continuance of that revenge, which from the begi^ning he
with so great virtue pursued; for being now left to struggle with the unruly
waves, whose imperious billows (many times counter-checking his desires) gave
him a feeling remembrance of his mortal constitution, he gathered new life, by
the hazard wherewith the old life stood endangered: and swimming with such
beautiful co^linesse as Triton is feined to do, when he vshers Neptune to
Venus banquets, with his sword in his hand, which often ensigne-like he
flourished about his head, as who should say, Danger is but the handmaid to
Virtue, or as if he would have challenged more perils then those, imputing the
escape of this no worthy reputation; without turning his eye back upon his
own safety, he followed on still the ruin of those to whom was left no
comfort but in ruinous perishing, and made such slaughter, that not a breathing
soul was left to complain, that so many by one were become breathless; But
he had no sooner finished the effect of what he hoped for: And Fury (wanting
a subject whereon to work more fury) had given place to the feeling of other
passions, when instantly his ouer-laboured body grew weak and ablelesse to
deliver him a living soul, made free from those perils; yet with an vnyeelding
virtue that was ever (or ever seemed to be) strongest in his weakest fortune,
he many times mounted up himself, and sprang upon the waves, joining both Art
and courage together as means for his deliverance. But even at the last pinch,
when strength had as it were finished the need of strength, unkindly strength
forsook him, and he sunk down, unable any longer to preserve that life,
which still then had preserved the life and estate of many kingdoms: but the
guilty waters (ashamed to be guilty of so execrable a murder) opened their
bosoms, and brought him up again into the air, where by the force of the siege
of the Sea he was borne upon the sands, and lay to the judgment of the
Shepherds (who till then upon their knees, were adoting him as a celestial
deity) breathless and without motion, in-so-much that with all their powers
they ran and recovered him ere the siege could come again, which as
appeared, greedy of another imbracement, made more then usual haste to
ouer-take him: and when daungerlesse they had laid him upon a neighbor bank
unto the shore, they beheld a person of so rare and vnmarchable proportion (in
whom all the beauties of the world were most liberally dis-iested) that
prodigal Nature in the work seemd utterly to have beggerd herself, and
becom'd penurious to all succeeding ages: It was not long before they had
brought him to life and the knowledge of the danger whereunto his life was
engaged; when suddenly he start upon his feet, and gazing like a wounded Dear
upon his concealed persecutor, he cried; O Thamastus, Thamastus, live thou
with men or Angels? unhappy that I am, shall I live to inquire if thou live? I
will not, I will not, my breath is not mine own if thou be breathless, nor
shall my days be augmented an hour after thy destruction, forsaken
Pyrophylus, dejected Pyrophylus: with that he wilfully would have thrown
himself into the Sea again, as in love with the peril which he hated, or
the death which with such difficulty he escaped. But the amorous Shepherds
hearing him name those two names, which kept the world both in awe and
admiration, ran hastily unto him, and folding him in their arms, with the
uttermost of their force, (which the love of those names had stretched to the
highest scale of their puissance) stayed him from the unnatural selfe-killing
combatte; and with the best oratorie that the simplicity of their bringing up
could then instruct their tongues, they persuaded him from impouerishing the
world of those excellent hopes which his very presence promised in most
admirable abundance: and coniuring him by those two rarely beloved and
praise-worthie names, (which with such feeling sorrow he hat uttered, and all
the Nations of the world with unspeakable reverence entertained) not to let
that day be registered in misfortunes calender, as the day of greatest
misfortune, by the loss of so divine an expectation; assuring him by those
especial tokens which they had noted during the conflict, that if his friend
whom he bewailed, were that vnco^quered spirit which in the gally had done such
matchless feats of chivalry; that then there was no fear of his perishing,
inasmuch as they had seen him make himself Lord of the Gally, ere the wind or
Oars had carried her beyond the compass of their sights. Further they humbly
upon their knees besought him, that if he were either of those two Princes,
whose sweet names were resweetned by his utterance, that it would please him
not to conceal it from their knowledges, who all be they were but Shepherds,
yet had that virtuous feeling of nobleness, which taught them a serviceable
duty to the incomparable greatness of such dignified states, The Prince
Pyrophylus (for such was his name) a little pacified, and hoping by this hope
in their speeches to kill his hopeless Despair, was content to be ouer-ruled;
though many times the feruencie of his love had almost ouercom'd that not
certainly grounded resolution: in the end, calling to mind that their fight
was both begun and occasioned upon the Hellespont, and that this place was
altogether beyond the bound of his knowledge, fearing the Sestian law, which
for the loss of the two faithful lovers Hero and Leander, adjudged present
death to the aproach of any neighbour-bordering stranger; and not forgetting
the contract betwixt him and Thamastus, that they should never be known where
ever they were disioyned; answered the Shepherds, that how ever they might
mistake his utterance, or his utterance beguile the intent of his own meaning,
it was so that he was called Adunatus, Prince of Iberia, who from the
beginning of his first knowledge, had held in singular admiration the memory
of Thamastus Prince of Rhodes, and Pyrophilus Prince of Macedon; so that if he
had spoke of them, it was but like a dreaming man, whose brain from the
superfluity of his thoughts apprehends diverse remote and far distant
imaginations; but for his own part, at that instant he said, he was both
careless and worthless, and worthy to be so unworthily careless, since his
fortune had lost him that rich blessing, which in any but the self same thing,
could by no Fortune be again restored; and therewithal desired to know of
them, upon what coast he was ship-wracked, to the intent he might make the
spediest search was possible to recover the great loss he had sustained: to
which the Shepherds replied, that the Country in which he now was, was called
Laconia, a Province in Peloponessus, adjoining to the Frontiers of Arcadia;
which having been long time governed (all be with many insurrections, and
rebellious commotions) by the renowned Basilius, was after his discease, by the
power of his testament (and as a man fit to curb so unruly a generation) given
to the noble and famous Amphyalus, his sisters son: a man so excellently
seasoned with the salt of all virtuous understanding, that excepting the hope
of Thamastus and Pyrophylus he stood in the eye of the world vnmatch-able and
beyond comparison; Pirophylus hearing them name Amphyalus (whom he had ever
respectfully reverenced for the rariety of his perfections) demanded where he
kept his Court, and how long he had hung his easefull armor by the walls to
meditate more safely upon the actions of other Nations? They answered, that his
Court was abandoned, desolate, and forsaken of all, in who^ grief by the
greatness of his birthright challeng'de not a fee-simple inheritance, and for
the place of his residence, it had been unknown to his subjects by the space
of these three years, at what time he departed thence with as great a burden
of insupportable coffeehouse, as Atlas or Olimpus with their ioyntlesse
shoulders could stand under; the reason whereof being (though many times
suspitiously coniectured) never sufficiently understood or daringly entered into
by any deuining or all-knowing judgment, was (they said) now at last (but
heaven knows how long they will last, which calls such excellency to the last
account of life-lasting) both known, censured, and to many iniudiciall ears
maliciously delivered, to the disgrace of the worlds best beauty, and the
destruction of a most famous queen, ever till then wondered for a wonderful
unblemished reputation, even Hellen Queen of Corinth, that harmles fair, and
fair harmles hurt creature, a Lady of a mighty humblenes and an infinite
mightines; virtuously alluring, because she was virtuous, and that virtue
married to an euer-adored beauty; Of a majesty fit for such greatness, and a
gracefulnes answerable to a pure wisdom: in truth such she was, as such they
should be that have so great perfections as such a celestial Hellen;

This name of Hellen, thunder-strooke Pirophylus, and as if his passion had had
a metamorphosing deity, stone-like he stood without sense or motion, till
reason the ensign of the souls holiness called back his spirits to their
usual attendance, and he earnestly besought the Shepherds as well for the
bettering of his knowledge (to whose taste he ever coueted to present the
nourishing milk of discourse) as for a burning ardor he had to make his
fortune the releif-master to a forlorn and and destressed Ladies afflictions,
to unfold unto him even from accident to accide^t all that had befalne to that
most beautiful Queen of Corinth, of who^ though in the coolnes of his entreaties
he gave no show either of familiarity or acquaintance (as indeed there was not,
having never in their lives seen one the other) yet almost from there
childhoods they had married one to another a virtuous opinion of honorable
estimation; being by alyance of blood nearely conioyed together, but especially
and above all for the near nearness both of affinity and love, twixt her and
Melidora, the only Goddess, to whose feet he laid all the sacrifices of his
swords honor or duty. Carino who ever more and more gathered out of the
rareness of his carriage, and sweet disposure of his gestures, a height or
exhaltation of honor beyond the comprehensiue conceit of his understanding,
both to be found dutiful to his cammandements, and to beget a further
continuance of so wished a presence (after the Prince by the Suns aid which
then shined hotly against the rocks, had both dried his apparel, and refreshed
his half drowned spirits) thus set the key of his bermonious tongue in tune,
to tell the utmost of his knowledges.

Although (most excellent Prince said he) from the clowdy darkness of our
little knowing remembrances, can arise no expectfull matter of memorable
consequence, the quality of our obscured estates depriving us the mean whereby
Princes affairs should be unfolded unto so unworthy ears, as well because the
weakness of our judgments cannot look into the causes of their fortunes, as
the insufficency of our counsels that can prevent no effect of fortune (how
adverse soever) proceeding from those causes; yet inasmuch as the worlds rumor
is many times retained for an Oracle, and the liberal tongue of Fame will in the
most respectlesse ears cover the worlds public counsels; I will declare unto
your excellent wisdom what the inuenomed instrument of Enuyes tongue to all
this whole nation most bytterly has declared.

At such time as the noble Amphyalus (who being loves true prisoner) kept
imprisoned the truest love, and the truest beauty that ever had power to
command love, I mean the incomparable Princesses Pamela, and Phyloclea, with
the Macedonian Pyrocles, at that time the Amazonian Zelmane had got the
absolute understanding of his mothers flint-hearted cruelty against those
immortal Paragons of the world, to whom he had even slaued the subjection of
his divine soul, and saw by the Caracters of their misfortunes, the desperate
evil whereunto the lothsomnes of his life (grown ugly with the deformed disdain
which had mangled his thoughts in pieces) would headlong convey the wretcednes
of his hopes, and when he had with a selfe-killing hand made that sword
wherewith he had overthrown so many Kings conquerours, and invincible Giants,
give a deadly assault unto the bosom of his hearts Cabanet, seeking by
untimely death to ruinate that glorious work of Nature, wherein the
excellency of the first workmaster had showed the best power of his arts
working; This beautiful Queen of Corinth (of whose dolours my brain is now
even great in labor withal) hearing not of that but of another most
dangerous wound he had received in a former combat betwixt him and the
excellent Musidorus; after a tedious and weary journey (wherein only love
took away the bitter feeling of wearines) she arrived in those parts of
Arcadia, with assured hope of his recovery by means of a most excellent Surgion
whom then in her country she retained; But in such an inauspitious hour of
vnluckines, that finding the fear of danger, taken from the danger she
feared; there was now an inrecouerable perrill wedded to a desperate
fearefulnes; for the foe was his own hand, and that hand guided by so hopeles
a love, that hating all things which the love he loved would not pity, he
himself had used against himself that violence, which else no violence could
have used: In brief when she came to his presence, she found him bathing in
his own selfe-spilling blood; and if not absolutely dead, yet so near the
confines of deaths Kingdom, that not the seuerest judgment could say or hope
he lived. To discribe the lively sorrow which assending from her dying heart
appeared in the watery Sunshine of her eyes; how often she swounded, revived, and
again and again re-dyed; what bloode-wasting sighs she uttered, what groans
she disburdened, how lamentably she bewailed, how desperately she raged, the
war betwixt her fair hands and her bosom, betwixt her torn hairs and the
winds motion, her tears burning in the beauty of her cheeks, and her
beauty drowned in the Channel of her teary Ocean: her co^fusio^, in sorrow
making an uniformity is heaviness, yet that heavy uniform, a barbarous Chaos of
misery: to describe this, I say, were labor infinite and innecessarie, the
rather since it stands in a memorial by the most memorable pen that ever
recorded matter worthy of memory: But at last when sorrow had as it were (in
the judgment of all her beholders) called to so strait an account all the
sorrows of her remembrance, that there was no other matter left save only
sorrow in her imaginations, and that so full of imperious command, as it was
high treason against her soul, to think it was not eternal: even then the
eye of wisdom (cleared by those afflicting clouds which muffled her
affections) began to discover the error in her forgetful passions; her weeping
making her neglect the means should bring her to not weeping; and her
complaints drawing on a certain end to work in her endless complainings;
whereupon turning from the dead reputed coarse, that her returning might add
more violent extremity to her compassionate languishment; and a little
depriving her eyes the blessedness of their sights, that with the same sight
they might be more divinely endeared; she humbly threw herself at the feet
of those Princes, whose heavy eyes not without abundant tears were spectators
of that immortally bemoaned tragedy, but especially she converted all her
speeches to the world, contemning Anaxius, a man whose selfe-louing opinion had
drawn into him a belief of impossible atchieuements, and to him she declared
the old age of her tedious despised love; the unremovable constancy of her
confident affection; and the world-wondring end her sorrow would consumate as
soon as her hopes were deprived the bliss of their expectation, ever and anon
mingling amongst her compassionate bemoanings, such an intyre adoration to the
name of Anaxius, preferring it before Angels, and recording it first of all in
the mighty inrolment of God-heades; that he whose blindness could apprehend
nothing but his own greatness, grew now great with child of imaginary
divinity: and though for the death of Amphyalus he had vowed a detestation of
all women, yet in love with his own glory, he was content (with a deformed
smile) to commend her, that thereby he might back again call to mind his
own commendations; and swoare by himself (for greater than himself, his
great heart would never acknowledge) that the royal humor of her greatness,
gave her an excellent inspection, and a determinate mean of well judging the
singularity of others perfections: but yet he who had never accustomed
himself to condiscende to any desire of virtue, because his Religion was
grounded upon this heresy, that honor was got by contradiction, and
greatness most feated by a particular denial of a general entreaty,
notwithstanding all the dartie Lances of her well tempted Oratorie, would have
utterly withstood her suit (which was only to have the co^ueyance of the body
of Amphyalus into her own country) had not his two brothers, called Zoylus and
Lycurgus, (to whom ambitious Nature had not been full out so prodigal, though
by a great deal too much, much too liberal in the same humor of ostentation)
taken a more lively taste of bitterness from her tears, and joined in the
approbation of her reasonable demand, drawing the strength of their arguments
from this ground, that since he was a desperate forsaken patient, whom no
Physician or Surgion in those parts, durst in the least hope give a light of
suruiuing, if any other part there were an insearchable skill unrevealed, it
was necessary to approve it, because nothing could draw the danger to a
greater height then it was already raised: besides they boasted what honor it
would be to them, to conduct the dead body to the bordering skirts of Basilius
army (which of necessity they must do) as it were in despite without either
controlment or damage, to the intents they purposed; This last speech (though
the other auailed) found a more insinuating acceptance in the Sunne-scalding
aim of Anaxius, so that he agreed to all her desires, giving her leave to
embalme the body with such preservatives, as for that purpose she had brought
with her: and told her, that as well for the virtues he found in her (of
which himself could better judge then any other creature) as for a careful
hope he had of his friends recovery, she should have that day not only her
wish, but also a God (meaning himself) to be her sanctuary defendant; and one
who would in such safety conduct her through the tents of his enemies; that to
her well seeing judgment should appear the terror of his greatness. The
comfortless Lady to whom the want of comfort served as a comfortable
companion, taught by her grief a politic carriage in grief, soothed up his
vanities by amplifying upon his vain grounds, and with hearty humbleness
offered to kiss his hand as a testimony of the assurance she reposed in his
magnanimity.

All things being prepared fit for so great a solemnity, Anaxius and his
train attending on the hearse; and the fair Queen Hellen, issued in a most
solemn and tragic manner from the Castle of Amphialus, and so conducted her
to the banks of the swift-falling river Ladon, without either impeachment or
disturbance: where after many confused shewers of uncontrollable tears,
seeming as if they would join with the river to ouerflow and drown the
neighbor plains. Anaxius and his brothers Zoylus and Lycurgus, took their
leaves of the Queen, and the dead reputed Amphyalus, and so returned back to
the place from whence they were departed.

The Queen left alone to accompany her dead Lord, (saving that she had only
twenty horsemen, and six Ladies which had been her gardiants in that woeful
voyage) commanded the coffin to be set down upon a fair bank of flowers by
the rivers side, and then taking her Lute, to the delicacie of whose sound she
married a more dilicate voice, sung this funeral Sonnet.

Strong heart, my strong cares unconsumed throne,
How big thou swellst with ever feeding grief,
I hoped that worn to nothing with my moan,
Nothing to nothing would have brought relief.
And you mine eyes that envy these fair streams,
Because they flow not over like your tears,
Learn by this river to abate extremes,
Since coolest woes breed longest lived dispaires.
But O mine Eyes you have immortal springs,
Fed by a heart which feeds upon distress,
And thou my heart art wed to sorrowing,
Sorrow, that sorrows-selfe cannot express.
Then heart grieve still, and Eyes augment your founttaines,
Till one make Seas, the other cloud-hie Mountains.
Here casting the Lute from her hands, that she might cast her hands with more
feeling ardencie about the beloved body, which with such unspeakable
adoration she had inshrined in the fair Temple of her spotless heart, After
my vnsympathised imbracements and cold kisses taken from his unfeeling lips,
she thus began to second her well tuned moanes with untuned lamentations.

Alas Amphyalus (said she) alas, thou that in the infiniteness of thine
unbounded Disdain, have had such an immortal sovereignty as to be the all
only director both of my thoughts and actions: how much mightier had been the
amplified honor of thy royal spirit, if the great Godhead of thy divinity,
had proceeded from a graceful pity, to the gnawing torrent of my miserable
distress? But I was unworthy, and woe is me that thy worthiness did not
esteem me a worthy subject to be ennobled by thy loves worthiness; yet was I
not fatal to the long lived kingdom of thy virtues; thou should not have
brought a consuming fire from Corinth, nor should my womb have delivered a
firebrand to waste Arcadia, O yes I was prodigious to thy birthright: and as
a blasing star at thine unlooked for funeral; For me (though not from me)
came that first knowledge of thy first evil, when thy dear Phyloxenus end
became the beginning of thy hate to my desires, and Tymotheus death a Seal to
that reuers-lesse deed of thy disdain, which no time or opinion shall ever
cancel; O unspeakable misery! O marvelous doom of my fore-doomed
persecution! O most wonderful impiety of a hapless beauty! O singular
affliction to an ever afflicting memory! and O just judgment of my
starre-crost destiny! O sorrow, just sorrow, be thou henceforth the justness
of my mediation! O fearful sorrow in the extremity of my fearfulnes increase
my sorrows augmentation, and let me sorrow, that ever sorrowing, my sorrows
are not amplifyed to a sufficient greatness: But why talk I of sorrow that am
not worthy of so gentle a sleepe-killing companion? O rest thee thou fair foe
to my rest; thou weeping eye of a soft heart; thou revenge of weakness;
unkindness satisfaction, and the key which vnlockes the closet of a concealed
affection! O image of sleep, sleep with my forgetfulness, and forgotten
contentments; And come Death, ugly Death, untimely Death, the rack to a burdned
conscience, the souls bitterness; the bodies grave, and the minds immortal
affliction; come thou and accompany my calamities, lead me to my Lord, that
he may behold in thee his Lordship over me: there is no reason I live, being
reasonlesse left of the love I adored. And here as if she would have drowned
herself in new tears, or proved that the greatness of grief is ever
begotte by the greatest expense of grief; she wept in such violent abundance,
that the extremity of that ouerflowe, brought her to a motionlesse dumbness,
in-so-much that one of her Ladies, whose eye had taken a full draught from that
cup of patheticall grief, taking the fallen Lute into her hand, awakened her
Queen with these mournful Stanzies.

Night like a mourner creepes upon moanes,
Yet troubles me because it lets me see,
The black faced image of my hideous groans
Which still vnstill increase to martyr me.
O eyelesse night the portrature of death,
Noise hating mistress of the hearts calm grief,
That charm'st our cares, and quiettest our breath,
O thou that art calamities relief
In thy downe-footed stealing, steal away
Woes memory, approaching with the day.
O not thou night the Sun set follower,
The general closer of all mortal eyes:
O thou art not my sad hearts sucoorer,
Even thee I waste and tire with agonies.
But thou eternal night Deaths elder borne,
Thou night of nights more powerful then the Sun,
Throw mountains on me that am most forlorn:
Most abject hapless, woeful, and undone;
O let my woes be into darkness hurld,
Or plast a burning Comet ore the world.
This song did so aggrauate the extremity of her passion, which now like an
ouer-wittie Sophister (whose fluent brain presents him more arguments then his
tongue can discharge, ever most in love with that which lies last unrevealed)
was conceyted that she could utter more wounding lamentations then she yet had
uttered, began to create new methods of complaining, till she was interrupted
by a discrete Gentleman her attendant, who persuaded her from that weariness
of mourning, chiefly where no ease-procuring sorrow made the laboursome day
eternal with vain labor, and brought no night of rest, to her so long
vnrested diliberations, arguing that these delays in her moanes, would if she
would continue them, bring her anguish to a more desperate state of misery,
the necessity of this extremity, craving no spurs but wings to convey her
hope to the end of that rare art, wherein all her hope was builded. This
speech laid such hold upon her reason, that adorning her fair cheeks with
the rosy blush of shamefastness, she rose up, and commanded the coffin to be
put into the litter in which her self rode, and so followed on her journey;
yet at every such convenient hour, wherein either the relief of Nature, or
the extremity of the hot burning Sun commanded a desistance from travailing;
she omitted not still to do the like, lest any ouer-curious eye should
imagine, that the travel of her mind received ease, when her body wanted
motion; observing the humor of an absolute covetous person, whose desires grow
greater when he enioies the greatest part of that he desired. After many days
and nights (all-be days and nights were not by her distinguished with any
difference) thus pitiously consumed, she arrived near unto her own most goodly
and beautiful City, the City of Corinth, whither news of her approaching
was some few days before comed, (as heaviness has ever more Fames then one
running before it) insomuch that Phalantus a gallant Knight, and base brother
to the Queen, at that time, and in her absence commanding (as her Vicegerent)
with the absolute authority of her Scepter; desirous to give her that
intertainment which might be most suitable to those lamentable delights whereunto
was co^tracted all the thoghts of her understanding; gathered together the old
remembrances of his own former disquieted happiness, (when the Varnish of
Artesias beauty blearing his eyes, made him imagine his heart was wounded with
an army of Lances) and caused these nourishing shows of displeasure
pleasingly to be presented unto her; first in her passage over the river Tegea
(which runs some two leagues from the City) as soon as she was entered into
her Barge, and lanched from the shore; with the artificial noise of sundry
vessels (prepared for the purpose) there arose to her imagination, a strong and
fierce storm, with such dreadful clappes of thunder and lightning, that to an
vnwel-apprehending sense, Art might seem not to borrow, but to lend much to
the divinity of Natures perfection. After these foregoers of amazement,
followed a tempestuous shewer of rain, which as if Juno had been at a new
entreaty with Aeolus, and offered not Diope but Hellen her-selfe for his
Paramour, was so violently carried with the seeming powers of many winds, that
the Barge-men who had the conduct of the Queen, all be they were agents in
these devised extremities, yet seeing the effect of the work go so far
beyond the effects of their knowledges, grew forgetfully astonished, and
began to lay down their Oars, and cry to be delivered from that fear
which themselves had created to show the power of fearfulnes. Never till now
did the solitary Queen cast up her eyes, or in the least change of
countenance give notice she had noted their proceedings; but with the
constantnesse of her sorrow taught them that the picture of true woe, was by no
Idaea to be taken; yet whether stirred by their (to no purpose) exclamations,
or imagining their stay a sign of her arrival on the other side, and that
they cried out but only to companion her bemoanings she arising, looked forth,
but saw all the air so smoothered up in an unnatural perfumed mist, (wherein
all delicate odours had with such an atonement symbolizd themselves together,
to make a perfect use of absolute sweetness) that it bred in her a delightful
wonder, with a respective carelessness, so that she cast her sight about her
with a more steadfast inquiry to behold the event of the stratagem; when the
vapor a little clearing, yet not so much that any brightness of the day might
from the inamaled forehead of the heavens be perceived, she saw or seemed
to see directly upon the shore before her, the model of an ancient Castle,
the curious frame of whose building by reason of the fogge could not be well
discovered, only as it was most likely either from some hic erected window, or
from the top of some well raised Tower she might behold a burning Lamp, that
with his often in and out appearing, sometimes violently flaming, and immediately
dampt, and deprived for a long space of his shining, showed the implacable
war of two contrary conioined Elements; and the madness of that storm,
tyrannizing over so little a spot of inflammation: But as she fixed her sight
thereupon, suddenly a wrestling in the waters close by her Barges side, invited
her eyes to a nearer object, and sheee saw swimming upon the waves in most
amiable gracefulnes, and with such an art-full dexterity as gave an ornament
to the silver liquid, a most beautiful and fair young man; close at whose
heels followed the Sea-god Neptune, with his Trident in one hand, and in the
other, small remnants of innumerable treasures, which he carried as figures of
that inestimable abundance, which is concealed in the bottomless womb of the
Oceans darkness; and with them, as it were, wooed the lovely youth, whose
mind borne upon the wings of contrary affections, conveyed him with an
inrespectiue motion from the presence of the God; often times in shrikes,
crying, O Hero, Hero, I have tardy arms and slow forces, unworthy attendants
for so sweet a beauty, at which the God with a mourning pitiousnes diued
down into the deep, and was no more descerned. At this the care-wasted Queen
apprehended the device, and presently called to memory that first story of
love which ever in writing was bequeathed to memory of the unfortunate Hero
and Leander: but with such greediness, that all-be she knew it was a devise
begotten to delight her passion, yet forgot that either it was devised, or that
her passion should delight in such sorrowfulness; wherefore as if it had been
the substance of that shadow it presented, she gave it such a memorable
entertainment as in despite of reason she brake forth into these weepings.

O excellent Hero (said she) that had triumph in thy love, virtue in thy
faith, admire in thy co^stancy, and in thy death a most blessed, blessed
martyrdom: thou were unhappy in thy too much happiness, and happy in the worst
end of thy sour fortune; thou did infinitely love, and were much more
infinitely affected, so that if thou did ever sigh, it was because thou
could not love beyond infinitenes: how contrary am I to the state of thy
proceedings, whose love is bondage, whose faith respectlesse, constanciesse
avail, and death (by a remoteness) too obstinately helples; thy Leander loved
that he might be disdained; mine disdained because he desired to be hated:
thine swam a Hellespont to enjoy thee; mine an Ocean to be removed from me:
thine made a perfect work, ere an imperfit ending; mine overthrew all labor,
because in the end should be no perfection. O Amphyalus, Amphyalus, if ever
those entombed eyes had power to heave up the coffins which incloud their
brightness, make clear those sweet circles, and look with pity if not with
love, upon pittious Leander, see how he plowes the waters to reap a foreign
desired harvest, whilst thou have a greater riches falling upon thy bosom!
see how he mournes for the slownesse of his bliss, whilst I cry out at the
swiftness of my misery! O Fortune how do thou auerse the countenance of
thy favor, and in the Atrocitie of my mishaps, buildest the glory of thy
Kingdom: when will thou bring back thine aspectiue mildness, and let me see
again those Halcion days of calmness, which in my first age I enjoyed? O
unbegotten entreaty, thou art as far from effect, as I from reason, and both
shall never meet with our wishes. And having thus said she fell to a new manner
of old lamenting; when the only eye imagined storm (imitating a tragic
disposition to make the last act the extremest) broke into an instant violence,
his companion darkness, which ever runs before him, having put on the worst
habit of his worst countenance: so that as if the clouds had been rent in
pieces with thunder, the air burnt to cinders with lightning, and the earth
thirsted to have bin drowned in an other Ducallidon, all things were put into a
confused amazement; during which outrage, the lamp was seen to be put out
with the winds, and sundry most lamentable shrikes to follow the departure; as
if it had been the Idaea of some souls happiness, when presently after the
heavens cleared, the waters calmed, the winds ceased, and a Serene mildenes
was disperced over all the continent, at what time the Queen with her careful
charge of cares arrived at the foot of the former deserned Castle, whose
stateliness in building, though it consisted of the weakest state of
continuance; yet was so shadowed with the best of Arts invention, that the
first apprehension of the eye would have adjudged it at an inestimable value,
like the most curious portrature of Venus, laid upon an otherwise despised
board, or a remnant of vselesse Canuas. As soon as she had set her foot upon
the shore, which was no sooner then the coffin could be discharged of the
Barge, there might she see upon the sands, Leander drowned, and Hero lamenting
over him, in her Nunne-like and virgin-stained apparel; who with all the
impossible passions of an impossible to be appeased fury, acted with such
lively tremor, the worst desperateness of a decayed fortune: that Hellen stood
as much amazed to behold her, as grieved to see so much woe in a counterfeyt
coffeehouse; and in her amazement looked first upon Hero, then upon her
self; after upon Leander, lastly upon Amphyalus, and thus many times sent her
looks to and fro poasting without intermission, every look bringing her back
matter of more mourning; in the end bowing down her heavenly countenance, she
said, if there were an end in woe, it were nothing to be woe begone: but being
eternal, it is a sad Dietie; and with that passed forward on upon her
journey. But she was not gone half a league further upon the sands, ere she
saw a Nymph running before her, whose hairs being loosed, partly by the
winds, but chiefly by the violence of her tyrannous white hands, followed after
her in such a dispearsed length, that if at any time she stood still, they
seemed to kiss the base earth in the falling, or cover it in the golden riches
of their beauty; as if she would make that barraine mould to be esteemed
before any other element; her neck was naked, only a costly Rebat of flowers,
(half loose) hung fallingly upon her shoulders; her garments which were of a
Sea-coloured silk, curiously embrodered with a Minataurian Laborinth, were in
many places torn, but so as every eye might see the disgrace was begot more
through a wilful madness, then either a negligent carelessness, or a wantfull
needinesse; thus as she ran, she sometimes threw her arms from her, as if
she would beat away the winds that flew wantonly about her; sometimes drew them
back, and locked them in together, as if she would embrace or hold the air
from fleeting; and sometimes linking her Iuorie fingers one within another,
raise them above her head to the Sky-ward, as if with that gesture she would
call pity from the heavens. And with these passionate motions filled the eyes
of her beholders, till come within the compass of their ears hearing, they
might more plainly understand her dolours, which with a burden of tearie sighs
made evermore their conclusion with the name of Theseus, accusing him of
flintie hardness in not relenting; of unkindness in not loving; of tyranny,
in not pitying; of falshoode in dissembling; and of ingratenes in just deserts
vnrewarding. By this the Queen perceived it was forsaken Aryadne, left to the
world by unjust Theseus, in the memory of whose mishaps (as in an excellent
myrror) she saw the lively image of her woefulness; whereupon she staid with
wonder, and wondered with pity at that which in her-selfe she could neither
pity nor wonder at: and as she stood in this unaccustomed pause with
teare-filled eyes, she saw old Sylenus upon his lazy Ass, either in a
dead sleepines, or a drunken deadness, come ambling with such an expectation
of falling, that his untoward motions, which in others bred a laughing
scornfulnesse; in her sad Lady stirred up a remorsiue fearfulness; after him
and about him went a troop of Satyrs pyping, and dancing; with bautrickes of
Iuie, and Garlandes of Poppie about them: then came in couplettes a multitude
of Bacchanals crowned with swelling Grapes, and red Roses; some bearing in
their hands carrowsing Cannes, some Myrtle boughs, some burning Tapers, and
some downie Cowches of Mossie softness; altogether like wild: Goats, running
and dancing with such measurelesse preportions, that it was not offensive to
say it was barbarous; yet was it so orderly befitting the actions of such
persons, that it showed there was a prescript form in unnatural rudenes.
After all these came the youthful God Bacchus, drawn by four snow-white
Hearts, and two sauadge Boros, in a Vinetree chariot, covered and invecked with
clusters of ripe grapes, and fair smelling flowers. They marched directly
toward Aryadne, insomuch that Hellen grew afraied, lest their rudeness should
add mislike to the lost-Ladies sadness, till she saw Bacchus with a divine
carfulness take her up into his chariot, and bear her from her view, as she
supposed toward the heavens; so that she cried, O happy Gnossian Aryadne, that
thy woes have found a diety to eternize thy wofulnes: shine ever in the
heavens, and be thou ever my Sun that I may see no light but thy memory:
Many such like moanes she vttred in the continuance of her journey, being ever
and anon incountred with such like devises, one seconding another so swiftly
that they left her no time to ruminat of any one precisely which to recount to
your alreadie-wearied hearing, would but lengthen my too-ill music and
ouer-poise with trouble your attention; therefore I will omit the story of
Pyrramus and Thysbie; of Phyllis and Demophoon, and many other records of
foregoing ages.

Hellen being now com'd almost within the view of the city Phalautus, mounted
upon a most fair Neapolitan Courser, and accompanied with an hundred knights,
besides Esquires, and baser attendants, in a most solemn and stately manner,
met her upon the way; and having (when she had less cause to make much of
melancholy) made trial of her resolution in misery, omitted all manner of
ceremonious persuasions, and only gave her that intertainment which stood
most agreeable with her distemperature, adding tears to tears, sighs to
sighs, and outcries to lamentations having learned all this Phylosophie, that
to sooth Melancholy, is to take away Melancholy, and not to contradict the
humor, is to give it knowledge of the error in the humor. After him came all
the Magistrates and chief Burgers of the city, whose low looks and
unpleasant gestures, gave assurance, that where the best part is diseased,
there the vnder-seruing members must of necessity pine in a languishing
weakness. And thus they marched in a sad triumphantnesse, like an ore-comming
host, that vanquishing many, by the loss of one particular, is notwithstanding
subject to a subdued heaviness. Now when she was com'd to the port of the
City, and was ready to enter in, she was there met with all the Damzels and
virgins thereof, who attyred Nymph-like in loose silks, which the breath of
eve ie air wantonly carried, and moved about them, with baskets of Roses, and
the most choice smelling flowers which that clime affoorded, upon their arms;
strewing all the Streets through which the Queen should pass, the outside
of the houses thereof being that day apparelled, either in Tissue, cloth of
Gold, Velvet, or rich Arras, as if the richness of such clothing, should
either hide from her the woefulness which for her woes was concealed within
them; or that making a Sabbath for her home-come, every one triumphed in his
wedding garment. And as the Virgins passed thus along, some with Timbrils, some
with Kyttes and some other new invented Instruments, to which they accorded
the heavy accents of their most sorrowful voices, they sang this mournful
and Elegiacke passion:

O Tedious hours that ouer-take swift time,
And in the end bringst back our wished for cares,
By which as by a circle we may climb,
Unto the endless height of our dispaires:
Add to our grieves, great ages of Lament,
Lorne in our selves, and loathed of content.
Thou elder brother to the first of all,
Whom men consume, but never can make less,
Thou smiling aim crier at Princes fall,
Father of death, husband of heaviness;
Add to our greeues, great ages of lament,
Lorne in our selves, and loathed of content.
For since there is no hope in our restore,
But like thy minutes so our moanes must rise,
And put to most this multiplying more,
Woe on woes fall as tear on tears from eyes
Add to our grieves, great ages of lament,
Lorne in our selves, and loathed of content.
And when the world shall blame, thy cruel mind,
That heaps affliction where Afflictions ^well,
Say long-liu'd Sorrow men do seldom find,
And least we may a flowrie pleasure smell:
Add to our grieves great ages of lament,
Lorne in our selves, and loathed of content.
Say Passion, Humor, Fashion, and Dispight,
Beguile the eye of Sorrow with false tears,
To which that men and Angels may do right,
By scorning them that shadows only bears:
Add to our greeues immortal lived lament,
Lorne in our selves, and loathed of content.
This infinite consort consisting of all the innumerable parts of true sorrow,
like a Riuer-swallowing Behemoth, drank up the universal tears of the
world, so that the spectators of this egregious lamentation, adjudged this
City nothing else but a vaste, sad, and disconsolate Trophonius, whose
entrance urged even the eye of delight to a relenting tearfulnesse; so that
even to such (if such in such a place could be) as had no feeling of the cause
of this felt woe, yet the touch thereof in the effects of others participated a
sympathized wayling to their rockie senselessness; and the more when they more
earnestly beheld, in whom and from whom the greatest part, (or rather the
whole, which to others lent part, yet like the Sun had no part less of that
in which she triumphed) was as from a goodly Fountain derived: But in the
end, when she was brought in this mourner-like royalty to her palace, which
was a most goodly Castle, very defensiuely fortifyed, and curiously built of
rich Marble, in the very heart of the City.

After many thanks (interrupted with many tears) both to Phalantus for his
care of her, and to the rest, for the sufferance of her folly, through which
she gat the knowledge of their loves: she with the dying Amphyalus, betwixt
whom and death was almost sealed the deed of perpetuity, withdrew her self,
and was no more seen in public, so the space of forty days: during all
which time, she bequeathed the desperate case of her loves Lord, into the
hands of the skilful Physician: A man of such age and decrepidnesse, that even
his life acknowledged a loathsomeness in her habitation, and Nature whom the
hand of Art by mending regenerated, with a malicious envy languished her
continuance, being bettered by that which for her slave she created. He was by
birth an Arabian, and well trained in the use of letters, whose near alliance
with the Sun inspiring him with a spritie humor of ambitious knowledge, led him
to delight in travel, and the taste of unexperienced customs; to that coming
upon a day to the mount Ida, he met with a Nymph belonging to the fount
Gaballine of who^ being inquisitiue to know the manners of that place, he got
the knowledge of the learned. Well of the habitation of the Mules, and the court
of memory yet unsatisfied and wandering further, he came into the grove, where
Paris first wooed Oenon, saw where they pitched their toils, where they made
their Pitte-falles, where in the heat they lay and mocked the Sun which could
not warm them; and in the cool where they bathed, while the Sun with his
gentlest heat, did refresh them; and amongst many relics left there for
remembrances of their love, he found that heavenly and rare Book, which
Apollo when he was ouer-gone with affection and desire of her beauty, gave her
as a monument to eternize her name before many multitudes of admirable women:
in it was the portratute of all herbs, plants, Mynerals, or what ever belonges
to the sacred study of Physic, together with their virtues, compositions,
effects, and uses: this he took, for this Oenon had carelessly cast away, when
confounded with the burden of care, she was become an outcast in the world,
and forlorn of Paris. And hence came those incurable cures, which in the
opinions of men made his name with such unspeakable reverence adored; and this
still he practiced upon the wounded Amphyalus, with such prosperous
seruiceablenes, that in few days he brought back unto him life, and his
servant remembrance; who yet not peace with that life which with former
vpbrayding he had violently put forward to destruction, began afresh to gall
him with new thoughts of that ancient Disdain, wherewith the most excellent
Phyloclea had disfigured and overthrown the beauty of his fortune; so that
the invisible wound of his soul, tankled and kept open the Ulcer of his body;
his new life being an old death worse then the body and the breathles
diuorcement; which once perceived by this most learned father of science, he
immediately applied those Antidots to his understanding, which drowned all the
faculties of his mind in a Lethe of forgetfulness; and he became such an Iris
in the mutable exchange of his resolutions, that he had all the colors in the
which any passion could be disguised, except that in which the memory of
Phyloclea alone was clothed, and that from the Genuine sense of his best
thoughts, had such an Anathema, or divided excommunication, that like a
Rauens-foster line, cast up into the woods to seek a desolate fortune, he had
utterly forgone, and shaked off the memory of her which being the most
precious thing in the world, he had made of her a more precious and dear
estimation. And now for exchange, both his reason, judgment, and affections,
as the Actuaries or setters down of his wills Cronicle presented unto him, all
the perfections and virtues of the truly loving Hellen. Now he saw in her
beauty, which only beautifying it self, beautified all things that to it
self was adjoined: An eye that speaking with many tongues of delight, spoke
only with the tongue of true affection; A brow wherein dwelling all the
Majesty's of divine greatness, yet only ruling with one which was the most
humblest wisdom. In brief, he now saw (that ever before had he not been
will-blind might have better seen) a Lady full of anointed royalty;
royalty exceeded in beauty; beauty in virtue; virtue in wisdom; and wisdom
in the excellent providence of her general carriage: in-so-much that as his
wound healed, his heart festred; and as his life strengthened, so the love of
that life weakened: even now fear and shame seaz'd tyrannously upon him,
fear; least his deserts should call in account the punishment of his life:
and shame, that he had no Apology to defend him from the disdain he feared
Fear, and Shame; Deserts, and Disdain, like a quadruple evil, or a torment
in four parts, rackt thus his mind almost to the height of desperatnes; which
no sooner perceived by her, whose want of pity had framed al her thoughts in
the pitifulst mould of mercy, but instant relief, upon such worthy and
honorable conditions, as might suit with the seuerest respect of virtue, gave
him that life of co^tentment, which even angels themselves celebrat as the best
thing belonging to our creation. Excellent and worthy Sir, for my country
broughtvp tongue, to ascribe to it self words matchable with the height of
those incomparable ioies which in either of these two great ones was
universally bestowed, through the blessed conjunction of their divine match,
were arrogance and weakness; because in their humors, and passions, they as
far go beyond the leuels of our capacities, as in their estates, honors, and
heroycall promotions: only let it suffice me to say, Amphyalus at last with a
worthy love enjoyed the nobly loving Hellen, the triumph at whose coronation
and wedding gained such a Superlatiue co^mendations in the praises of al tongs,
that I know there is no worthy ear utterly void of the knowledge, the rather,
since al Greece is still and ever will be in labor with the deliverance of those
wonders. Immediately after this triumpha^t marriage, Basilius died, and
Amphyalus, with his Q. came into this country of Laconia, whose crown he
challenged and possessed by his uncles testament; but whether the nature of the
country, which ever have bin ominous to the Princes thereof, or the star-crost
destiny of her poor Lady (to who^ eue^ destenie was deholden for the patient
indurance of her affliction) were the nefarius and bloody conspirators of her
untimely and abortiue evil, I know not: but soothly then this there is nothing
more credible that they had not continued together many years, ere the cinders
of old disco^tentment (which whether stirred up by his flatterers, or inkindled
by his spies, those Emissaries and canker worms of a peaceful continuance)
brake into a prodigious eruption, or maine fire of displeasure in his before
best-seeming to be contented mind; the particularities whereof; cannot
capitulate against, because they be mysteries concealed from our knowledges,
only some two years ago, when the blessedness of his presence made us forget the
miseries would follow his absence, and least fearing what most to be feared,
came poasting upon us, unknown to any but those of his most priuatest
cou^sailes, he departed from this land, disguised in an armor of unknown
metal, which the skillful Arabian his late Physician, by a most unrevealed
Art had been many years in making: and for a remembrance given it to
Amphyalus, as a Jewel of more worth then all the worlds treasure: And under
whose covert he might compass those conquests, which should out-reach the
height of possibility. And doubtless if the Erraticall tongue of Fame have
not taken too great a taste of misreporting, he has since his departure
effected wonders, beyond the wonder of expectation. But he had not been absent
many Months, ere the rupture and impostume of our evils broke like a windy
Meteor through the bowels of our fortunes, and over all the land (after many
night-still mutterings) it was sounded with day-heard exclamations, that Hellen
was turned retrograde in her virtues, become dissoyal to her husband, broke her
faith with her Love, dishonored marriage, foiled co^munitie, slandered beauty,
and was the efficient cause of the living death, wherein Am^hyalus lived
eternally exiled. This general defamatorie (and as as I hope) libellous report
had so many thousand Proselytes, or children of Error, which with winged
tongues gave it a free way and a nimble passage, that all-be it Bastard-like
knew no father but that Hydra or monster Multitude; tongues accusing tongues,
Fame, fame; ears, ears; but no knowledge, no true understanding; yet the love
of our King, and such a King of such a divine integrity, meeting with our
fear, which for his absence discovered the least peril that any way could
threaten our estate with hazard, made Belief become a slave to report, and
providence to wade no further then the limits of a restrained fancy: whereupon
the sorrowful Queen, whose omnipotent sorrow for her Lords loss, might
either witness her innocence, or have excused the addition of other woes,
since not any was more insupportable then that she carried, being attached by
Rumor, was indicted by Report, condemned by Heresay, and adjudged by We will have
it so; Fear lodging in the eyes of Wisdom, and Affection in Judgment. It
was bootlesse to excuse where millions did accuse, and in vain to wish the
truth, when had he come clothed in contrary colors, he would never have
been believed: in this manner the careful, comfortless, and despised Lady,
continued till within these few days, when Opinion (by what means we know
not) grown to a stronger (but heaven knows how much better) resolution,
called the dying Queen to a public account of her Countries overthrow; to
which she not able to give other answer then tears, sighs, outcries, and
protestations, was forthwith adjudged by a general Edict of all the now
greatest rulers in this land, to be brought to this place, and here to be put
into a mastlesse Caruile, which conveyed by a conuoy of other ships into the
midst of the Euxine Sea, there to restore her to the mercy of the waters, and
the predestinate end of her unhappy stars reuolutions. This is the day of
her exilement; this the execution place of her judgment; and her in this
creek lies the Caruile which must carry her to her desirelesse long desired
intombment. For this, rise we so early to bemoane her misaduentures, and to
exclaim against the Sea if it would claim interest in the blood of so
superexcellent a beauty. And thus you know what we know: which al-be I
deliver Beare-whelpe-like without shape, or perfection, yet may your happy
knowledge form it in some Angel-mould of blessed fortune; and to make you more
assured of my reports trunes, if I be not deceived, yond black cloud which
arises with increasment from the earth, should be the fatal (and in that
unhappy) conductors of the woeful Q. to her miseries miserable ending.

At these words Pyrophilus suddenly lift up his countenance, and perceived
from far a troop of horse, that came poasting thither-ward, at which sight
awakened, Honor began to rouse herself in his spirit, and lifting up the
cheerfulnes of his heart, he said in himself, O my soul, thou heavenly guest of
an earthly mansion, either this day will I make thee a free Citizen amongst the
stars, or sending my Fame beyond the stars, pluck Virtue perforce from
almighty darkness: O my life, I have little loved thee, yet love thee now
dearly, since thou art preserved for so holy, and so worthy an oblation: And
this said he departed from the shepherds, with such an amazed violence, as
that if his intraunced senses had but the while before slumbred in a swoundine
discourse, and now been awakned with some Elixar of his own imaginations, he
was carried by himself so far beyond himself, that forgetting the due adieu
of common courtesy, he left his virtue to their most seuerest censure: And
running to meet the near-drawing troop, placed himself in that way which of
force they must pass; And as soon as the first vancurrer incou^tred with him
face to face, with fair and reverent speeches he demanded of whence the retinue
was, what royal person they guarded, and to what end their journey was
directed? the other whose clay-bred coldness had no feeling of the heat of honor
(and the rather to behold the Princes foot-going weakness) in respectively
without answer would have passed by him, had not the Prince staid his horse by
the head-stall of his bridle; at which the inciuill Squire, not only with
churlish words, but the offer of a blow threatened his own freedom; till the
other having ever held himself a stranger to such salutations, and more then
angry with his immodest behauior, enraged, pulled him from his horse with such
an infinite power, that he brake his neck in the falling, and sent his soul to
tell Pluto what is the true desert for inciuilitie; whilst at the very
instant, the most admirable and heroyicke Pyrophilus mounted upon his slain
adversaries horse, and drawing his sword, which he did more to defend his
Honor, then to give honor to any of them by his blows, fairly paced toward
the rest of the troop, who by this time having seen the death of one of their
consorts, all with one touch of coffeehouse, ran furiously upon the
Prince, and assailed him with the greatest power that any way could proceed
from their mean greatness: but look how we see a Greyhound when he is
environed with a multitude of little Curres, stands with a mild
scornefulnesse, and receyues the worst of their assault; in the end checking
their audacitie with a reuengefull deadliness; even so the Prince out of his
disdain, received their worst malice, and in requiting of their daring,
returned them blows for blows; but of such unequal natures, and of such over
heavy substance, that many of their deaths, might have forewarned many of
them from like deaths: But rage that was ever blind, and feate which then had
so got how to escape from rage; madly lead them on to destruction: so that the
^ay increased, and the Prince found much difficulty in defending himself
from their many defyances: partlye because he was loath to spill so much
weak blood, and partlye because he wished a less punishment for an offense
of rudeness: But when some small wounds (which for want of care he had
received) told him the effect of greater mischief, he banished the
remembrance of all mercy, and like a Panther robbed of her young ones, lest not
of thirty Knights and Squires one breathing soul, to weep his fellows
overthrows, so much did eyter wrath or power, or rather a powerful wrath,
govern and direct his instant actions; which being finished, he went unto the
Coach, and assuring the Governor thereof (who either through care, or fear, or
a fearful care, amazedly stood still, yet in seeming ready to run away
like a heavy Foul that often waves his wings ere the air can bear him from
the earth) that he should have no hurt, looked in, and beheld in the one end a
most comely, grave, and portly Lady, in whom though middle age had chidden from
cheeks, the vain boast of youths decaying beauty; yet was her countenance
governed with such maiesticke beams of settled modesty, that all men might
read in her eyes a promise of great wisdom; in the other end, two lovely and
fair young Gentlewomen, whose attending behauiours showed them to be no other
then her attendants: But the shadow of his countenance was no sooner seen
within the Coatch, when the Lady, First in wonder at his attempt being a
stranger, and none to counter-check the strangeness of his attempt, arose, and
looking forth, saw her men slain, or so near slain, that there was
impossibility in any ones recovery, with a spirit that might well seem to
lodge in so noble a breast, she demanded what he was, wherein she had
offended, or what triumph he expected from a victored Lady? to which with a
hie prysed humility, that well the beauty of his condition could both deliver
and adorn, he returned this answer.

Excellent Lady, if the sowrnesse of my fortune in this not rash but defensive
action, has either in your judgment made weak the power of your trust, or
given you occasion to grieve at the impouerishment of this poor succor, let
the tender of mine enderest service, and the commaundment of my sword, so much
the better by how much it wades before these slain creatures, in advantage
excuse mine error, and be a witness how free my thoughts are from any dishonor
to your excellency: but if they were (as be they cannot) the factors of an ill
denounced judgment, to ingrosse up mischiefs, either against your sacred life,
or the title of your virtue, be their own deserts their ruin, and my sword
the justice of an upright heaven; Divine Hellen, and sacred Queen of Corinth,
for no less I take you, and less beams I do not see in the sky of thy noble
gesture: if there be a justice under heaven, or that Justice which so long
since fled to heaven, may be either discovered by power, or enticed from above
by virtue, I have this day inlye sworn to mine one soul, to build her upon
these plains a new habitation, and for your sake (upon whose integrity I
will erect the foundation of mine honor) to cancel the utmost bond of life,
or chase away the clouds which pass betwixt the earth and thy reputation; yet
Madam, I protest this bloody beginning was no intended Proem of my service,
only the rudeness of your attendants, nay, I fear your executioners, who
with barbarous blows made answer to a courteous demand, was it that has
dispeopled you and displeased me; for which I with a hearty humbleness,
intirelye crave pardon.

The noble Lady, having in his speech taken most amplified notes of a princely
magnanimity; and beholding in the hie top-gallant, of his valor, so low a
decline to honor absolute weakness, and withal studying upon the error of
his conceyte, which had mistaken her for Hellen Queen of Corinth, loath to
loose an opportunity so happily overtaken, And in fear by too sudden a
discovery, to hazard that which with an earnest longing she desired, was
contented a little (by no denial) to maintain his misbeliefe, and therefore
in this sort replied.

Worthy Sir, if I fail in the homage due to so seeming a worthiness, let my
weak sex, and the ignorance attending me in my weakness, be the excusefull
pardon of my faultiness: And the less I pity (though every death is
weepe-worthie) the overthrow of these my followers, since their rude eyes were
so bad intelligencers as would not let their hearts understand, that even in
your outwardest show, was tokens of more then ordinary presence: yet let me
entreat you, and conjure you by all those tenders you have made me of the
treasures of your service: first to let me know your birth, fortune, and your
hither adventure, and then not to forsake me, till as you found me you leave
me again in the hands of other safety.

To this he made answer, that as concerning his birth (which he couetted to
conceal in the bosom of silence) he was borne in Iberia, and though
unworthily, yet Prince and heir of that Dominion, his name was Adunatus, the
bitterness of whose fortune bore in it such tragic matter of a life
fore-worne, and wasted with the most vnspeakablest misery that ever absolute
miser could entitle miserable; as he did not only grieve, but feared to
discover to the world the infiniteness of his woes, which (as he was
persuaded) went far beyond either comparison, or conjecture of the wofullest
estate whatsoever; and therefore most humbly besought her, that he might no
further reveal the wretchedness of his mishaps, whose vntunefulnesse would
but distaste the noble ear of her understanding; lastly, for his adventure
thither, he said it was a blessed mischance, and a happy shipwreck, because
he hoped that her excellency (of whose wrongs even Gods and Angels stood
agreeued) should from the hand of his danger reap the new inioyment of her
absolute safety, and therefore that she should not need to command his
service, but rather study how to employ his service, which all be worthy matter
more precious then the dearness of his life commanded him to other far
removed adventures, yet for her noble virtues sake he vowed not to depart from
her, till her own free will should give a resolute liberty to his other next
desired endeavors.

This princely legacy (said she) is a royal inrichment to the lowest descent
of Fortune: But O this worlds fashion, this courseship of words, this father
accomplime^t, this honey air, this bond of breath, this coppi hold right of
friendship, is no other then the shadows of our bodies, which then at all is
not when we most assuredly imagine it is, and I fear me this bequest will
be but as the Testament of a living man, which is apt to change with the
change of every opinion.

Think not so Madam (replied he) for you shall not find it so, and with that
began to lay protestation upon protestation, vow upon vow, and oath upon
oath, knitting them all-together with the bond of an upright Religion; so that
the Noble Lady (whose own opinion, like a true speaking Augure, delivered most
large Prophesies of his excellent singularities) unwilling any longer to
detain him from the knowledge of that whereunto time and her desires must
perforce bring him, in plain and sweet framed words, graced with the state
of so well settled a countenance, as showed Majesty to be the birthright
inheritance of a royal descent, told him wherein he had mistaken her, and that
she was not as he supposed Hellen Queen of Corinth; but Euronusa Queen of
Tenedos, one that if love and affection had power to make two, one was in
nothing divided from that dearelye and ever to be beloved Hellen, and that
having had notice to what damnable use this Apostate and Postridian day was
reserved, namely the destruction of her, who till this time had been the
sauegard of many kingly hearts, and hearts Kingdoms, was come either with her
prayers, tears, or the threats of a divine Justice, who as the apple of his
eye maintains the oppressed estate of the innocent, to take away, or at least
defer the unjust rigor of her undeserved condemnation, to which she had
many hopeful, and well pleasing persuasions, as her estate, power, and
kindred, the law of Nations, and the opinion of the world, apt to rebel
where so unnatural tyranny is offered to an anointed sovereign; but chiefly
and above all these, an ancient and long exercised acquaintance betwixt her and
the noble Phalantus, who (as she heard) being a principal actor upon this
stage of suspicion, was not unlikely to rule and overrule the tide of mutinous
and barbarous misconceyued credulityes, and with him she intended to deal so
effectually, that he should not only be free from the detection of so
monstrous an imagination, but if not for virtues sake, yet for his Honors
sake, himself seek to undergo by the just trial of a well managed sword,
the happy means of her deliverance: But (said she) fair Prince, since the
heavens (who in their all-knowing uprightness, know what is best for their
gloryes and our weakness) have allotted you as a sacred Vmpiere in this devout
and most holy action: Be omnipotent in thy resolutions, go forward and persist
even to the death in this all-loue-gaining atchieuement, so shall thine honor
either exceed the glories of thy great birth, or thy death be crowned with an
immortal Diadem of men's praises and admirations; Never did the unspotted Moon
blush with a more bashful amazement, when mistaking her desires, she kissed the
sleeping cheek of Endimion, then this all-worthie Prince did when he beheld
himself thus intrapped within the commandment of an unexpected obedience: but
when he had called into the depth of his consideration, the whole account of
both their intentions, and saw the level of their aims was the advancement of
one entire glory, and that what honor and piety stirred in him, love and
acquaintance kindled in her; he absolutely without further disputations
resolved that he had well done, in what he had then done, and how ever the
loss might redound either to his life or fortune, yet never to start aside, or
infringe the least article of his honorable concluded bargain; and with that
alighting, and disarming one of her slain Knights, and arming himself with
his pieces, he mounted upon his horse again, and ryding before the Coach,
paced back to that place where before he had left the two unfortunately
loving Shepherds, and now found conuocated together on that reserved Theather
of the most worst expectations, an infinite number of all sorts of pitiful and
vnpitying people, some shedding tears of true sorrow for the accident; some
weeping to see others weep, and some for fashion sake to be thought soft
hearted, though they neither apprehended the terror, nor felt in themselves any
sympathy of like misfortune; all with one greediness, like an eye-longing
Auditory before the beginning of some hie state-promising Tragedy, looking
about and wishing to see what they made the world by their sorrow believe they
were loath to see,

Amongst this assembly came the Queen Euronusa, and the valiant Adunatus,
placing themselves in so convenient standings, that nothing either by word or
act, could pass without their judgments or knowledges, with no less
expectance of what should then ensue then the rest, though with far
contrary determinations; for in the one of them was a Pity full of Help, in
the other a power able, and therefore inwardly resolved to help, whereas all
other succor was but Pity, and God help, the Pyning charity of a miserable
giver. But they had not stayed so long in this place, that one could well say
they had stayed any thing at all, when there arrived there two Bishops, and
two grave Lords of estate, whose wisdoms had built them great honors in the
Commonwealth of Laconia, and with them (either as a defensive guarde to
maintain the uprightness of their Embassage, or as a Bugge-beare to affright
the many headed Monster opinion, ever then ready to be delivered from the
womb of common multitude) the most noble and valiant reputed Phalantus, armed
in a black Armor, curiously damaskt with interwinding wreathes of Cypres, and
Ewe, his barbe upon his horse, all of black Ab^osetta, cut in broken hoopes
upon curled Cypress; his horse also all black, and upon his shield which was
suitable to the sadness of his attire, there was imbosted a flying Pegasus,
yoaked to a Plough, fastened in the earth; under which was written a Greek
sentence which signified, Compulsion not Desire, and before these rode six
Purseuants, not four Kings at Arms, in the rich abilliments of Laconia: after
them a close Litter covered with black Velvet, and supported by two blake
horses, in which the desolate Queen was borne to her murderous exilement:
after her road all the chief estates of that Country, and on either side, as
two guarding wings marched sundry bands of the most expertest Soldiers in
those parts, conducted by the most principal Captains of that Kingdom: but
when they were come into the midst of the prease of common people, and that
the Bark was towed into the Ocean, and a Barge ready to receive the Queen to
bear her aboard the unfurnished vessel, there grew such a murmuring
confusion, and such a disunion of thoughts amongst the multitude, that like
the iarring sound of many untuned Instruments, they not only amazed the
Nobility, but also gave undoubted cause to fear some sudden insurrection
whereupon one of hie place (called Cosmos) whose excellent understanding, was
graced with a more excellent eloquence, being lifted aloft upon men's
shoulders, after solemn Proclaimations made by the sound of Trumpets for a
general silence, thus with a loud voice spoke to all that were congregated
together in that presence.

You people of what kingdom soever you be, which come to be beholders of this
days deeds, chiefly you, O you Laconians, to whom the memory thereof shall
remain, writ in the hearts of you and your successions for ever; why are you
carried like a Deluge with every wind, or affrighted like Babes with
insufficient suppositions? O call up your wonted courages, and look into your
own calamities, whilst I intend here first to denounce unto you your loss
which is unspeakable, your redress which is unrecoverable, and the sacrifice
for our evil thought most available; your loss it is the loss of the most
excellent Amphialus, a Prince in whom Nature, Art, and wonder, strove to
extol the omnipotency of their powers, in the infiniteness of his
excellencies; a man of such admirable virtue, that his whole life was the
worlds best Academie of dearest beloved goodness, powerful beyond
controlment, hard without rashness; wise without austeritie, and honorable
in the utmost lists of insufferable extremity; a Lion Lamb, and a lambe-like
Lion; an vnuanquisht goodness, yet a goodness thrall to what ever was good
reputed, Nay more, your loss is the loss of your King, the head and
sovereign of your now dismembered bodies, the ornament of your lives, the
maintainer of your weals, and the strait upholding columbe of your selves,
your wives and childrens safeties: he that in his hand bears the calender of
your peace, registring years of playful Sabboths, where before laboursome days
of mourning by continual garboyls, were howerly numbered and increased; whose
sword was your victory, and whose victories were those glories which made you
stand admired and adored; your loss is the loss of the father of your
Country, that dear father that has brought her up to excel all her
companions in beauty and perfections, he that has made red his eyes with
manly weeping, to see her in her Cradle, sick, weak, and almost dying, he
that has brooded her under his wings, fed her with his blood, and lodged her
in his bosom, he that has made himself lean with watching, least she
should perish in her sleeping, and he that has slept with pity, when his
errors strove to awake him, to take revenge of her impieties. This, O
Laconians, is your loss, the virtuous Amphialus, your King, your glory, your
beatitude, and your father; will you then loose all this, and yet reserve to
your selves the name of living creatures? will you cloth this dishonor with
sufferance, yet expect to be accounted virtuous? O that it were possible, or
that drawing these wrongs in a Lethe of opinion Laconia might either hold her
reputation, or you your own safeties. But since the all surueying eye of
Justice will not so have it, be not as examinated carcasses, but as eternal
spirits to redress these ruins of your fortunes; Redress, said I, O that
there were such a word left but to guild our remembrances: O no Countrymen, in
that alone is the Superlatiue of our miseries reserved: there is no redress
for our calamity, no Baulme for our wound, nor no repeal that can call back
our banished good fortunes; Things hopeful to be amended, may with modesty be
less by much bewailed; but desperate Ulcers incurable, are both the mind and
bodies continual torment; were there a time in any time left to behold his
home returning, then might the expectation of that season give some sweet
taste to our afflictions; but all is taken away, all hope, all goodness, all
past and to come good fortune; for who has banished him but himself, and who
will maintain his exile but his own resolution? himself that is the God of
his Fortune, and his Resolution a decree like Fate never to he controlled: Is
it likely that he who most preiudicately saw his own ill, and eschewed it,
will seek to revive that evil, and anew to return unto it? It cannot be
imagined, or if it could, the vows he has thrown throughout the world are
impregnable Bulwarks to withstand his returning, having sworn by his
princely hand never again to behold Laconia. If he then be valiant, that
spirit will detain him; if he be wise his wisdom will make his vows lawful;
and if he be just, there can no injustice shine in his actions. And to the
first, let his conquests speak, to the next his government; and to the last,
both the world and you that are his people. Thus is our amends frustrate, and
Redress slain utterly dead for ever; Is it then in your opinions tolerable
to loose him, to lack remedy, and neither to him nor us yield any
satisfaction? the gods forbid! then our satisfaction must be the abolishing of
that evil by which our first evil was engendered, which is the life of Hellen,
even Hellen the too-early late-crowned Queen of our Country, she that has
ouerthrown the goodly temple of her virtue, by an inuertuous communicating of
those beauties which to him only should have bin for ever most dearly
preserved; she that in her love has been false to Amphyalus, dishonorable to
herself, and an utter ruin to us, you, and this country. If then you will have
your King restored, restore him by her death, for in her ending must consist
the best of his living, and in this action does the world infinitely gaze upon
you, to see whether any vain title of beauty, or perfections can rebelliously
withdraw your minds from the execution of justice: restore unto your selves
your ancient honors, by banishing out of the land your dishonours, which is
only she by whom all our infamies are maintained; and that this may be
performed by such a direct mean of well intending, that no severe judgment may
attach us of cruelty; thus have the Senate and Lords of Laconia decreed, that
Hellen shall be conuaid into a Caruill mastlesse and sailelesse, vnmand,
vnuittaild, and of all munition unfurnished, which being toaed forty leagues
into the maine Ocean, there be left to the mercy of the gods, the seas, and her
own furtune if she be blameles, her preservation will be doublesse; if faulty
her end will be swift and without pity; how ever in us will be nothing but
the discharge of a most loyal duty, wherefore as many as love Amphyalus, wish
for Amphyalus, or hope for the benefit of his blessed sight, throw up their
hats as a sign of consent to the execution of this noble justice.

The whole assembly whose minds were variously carried up and and down with a
desire and fear, or a fearful desire to wish nothing that might put them in
fear of ensuing good fortune; And even those betwixt whose lips yet stuck
the word of safety, to the neuer-ill deserving Queen Hellen, were so
inchaunted with the plain Rhetoric of this honest-seeming Oration, that as
if all their several bodies had had but one mind, that mind one head, that
head but one tongue to utter their cogitations, cast up their caps, and cried
the judgment was excellent, and not to be reuersed: all be even at the
beginning of the speech scarce any two agreed one in opinion, some consenting
more for fear then conscience, some dissenting as much upon will as loyalty,
some to be reputed strickt performers of Justice, some to be thought
charitable in pitying the innocent, some to seem to understand deeper
mysteries then were hid in plain dealing; and some to pick a thanksgiving
of such as might pursue like hard fortune: All in such mutiny of censures,
that it was impossible either to discern Pity, Mercy, or Justice, until the
colors of this speech (as always the eyes of common multitude are bleared
with showfull reportinges) had brought them to concur and agree in one
Opinion and consent of her destruction, the fearful fearing the scourge of
disobedience; the wilful willing to have their wills performed; the severe as
delighting in cruelty; the charitable for a counterfaite love to their
Country; the wise to be renowned for their deepnesse; and the flatterers to
draw to them a good opinion of well meaning; which no sooner was perceived by
the most politic Queen Euronusa, whose heart enkindled her brain with a
fiery wisdom, to see the desperate estate where-unto the air of words
drew her dearest beloved, but breaking through the multitude, and opposing
face to face with the Nobility of Laconia, lifting up a well tuned voice,
guarded with so reverent a countenance of glorious Majesty, as did not only
entice but astonish the beholders, drawing their attentions to a silent
dumbnes, she thus made answer to the former Oration.

You Princes, Lords, and Commons of Laconia, let neither my presence (how
greatly so ever at this time inexpected) nor my words (though far unsuitable
to this voluntary consent you have given for the killing of a worth innocent)
breed in you so much wonder, as your inconsideracie (never till this time
known, or attached) stirs in me an admiration beyond the compass of common
admiring, the rather when I behold your grauities directed and led by the
blind eye of no reason; why, whither are your Noble judgments fled? (till
now the Schools of other Nations) where are your faiths? where are your
loves? and where are your wisdoms? Are all slain with insubstantiall words,
with broken arguments, and ungrounded supposes? O that it were as lawful for
me to chide you, as it is most necessary for your selves, in your selves, to
condemn your selves as blameworthy; you have this day by your consents hurt
only Amphyalus, dishonored only Amphyalus, and adjudged to death not Hellen,
but in Hellen the living soul of Amphyalus; in-so-much that if the
backe-looking eye of your understanding do not recall that unadvised evil of
your too-suddaine verdite, it will be too manifestly true (as this Gentleman
has ouer-wel delivered with an ill intention) that your loss will be
unspeakable, your redress unrecoverable, and no satisfaction (though the
sacrifices of your own wives and children) will in the eye of the world be
esteemed auailable, for it is most certain, that in loosing her, you loose
that Prince, that virtue, that power, that strength, that wisdom, that honor,
that Lion, that Lamb, and that goodness he has spoke of; nay that King, that
hade, that ornament, that maintenance and colombe of your safeties; and more
then this, and more then he or I can or have spoken, the divine father of your
kingdom, since the Sacramental mystery of two most entirely loving hearts
co-vnited, and inseparably joined together; has made them one flesh, one
spirit, and one body, so that they are not two but one creature, not he
Amphyalus, but Hellen, nor she Hellen, but him you seek to kill, which is
only Amphyalus, for no more then the shadow can be removed from the body (and
yet be a shadow) the breath from life, or the falling rivers from the Ocean:
no more may they be separated, divided, or disioyned; if then you will not
loose him, loose not her in whom is his being, if for himself you will destroy
himself, what thanks can you reap of him, or his admirers? were it not most
preposterous in your judgments, by fire to seek to quench fire, or to heal a
pain, by adding to it a greater pain of the self nature and condition? O let
Ignorance it self, censure in that position; and what is this you now
undertake, other then such proceeding seeking to cure his sick honor with a
mortal Apoplexy? nay, let me descend nearer into your errors, and tell me (O
you Laconians) who has accused her, where are the testimonies of her evil, or
who dare to affirm with an vnblushing face that she is guilty? can your laws
of Laconia by fore-poynted doomes prescribe Princes in general consultations,
and find a treason where there is neither fealty nor allegiance? strange law
of a strange senate. But be all things as you will, shall not the just hand of
the infinite justice be stretched against you, and your successions, even to
the last generation, if you violate the laws of Justice? be assured it will;
therefore for your own sakes and safeties, repeal your sentence, or at least
defer it for some few days, in which if she procure not a champion that
shall with a well ordered sword defend her innocence; let the persecution of
her fortune pursue her faultiness.

At that word the whole assembly, with an infinite clamor stopped the further
passage of her words, and flocking about her like a swarm of Summer Bees, on
the Mount of Hybla, cried, she had but well spoken, and that there was nothing
but justice and reason in all she had spoken; turning all the rasors of their
opinions against that judgment, for whose maintenance before they were only
whetted; so variable are the resolutions of the multitude, and so apt to
delight in the last sound, how discordante soever. Which being perceived by the
politic Queen, who loath that the cold words of any elder wisdom should
quench the blaze she had newly kindled; after the bowing of her hand for a
token of silence, she again these or such like words uttered.

How suitable to your Noble grauities is this honorable consent (most famous
Laconians) who knows not that is worthy of any knowledge, and how much in my
self it shall be both respected and rewarded, witness mine hereafter
deseignes, and my present thankfulness, for never was there any example of
more just love, or of the love of justice; yet since delay is the only torrent
of hope, and Desire the sworn enemy to expectation, that mine innocent suit
may be stained with neither of their imputations, behold here the most
excellent Prince of Iberia, the famous Adunatus, who willing to expose his
sacred person in so notable a defense, stands to approve her never to-be
blotted innoceny.

Scarce had the Queen delivered these words, when Cosmos again stepped forth,
Anger and Disdain warring in his countenance, willing to defend what was
indefencible, began to second his first speech; But the common people,
according to their common custom, when either they hear what they would not,
or are come to the full point of what they expected, began some to hemme, some
to cough, some to spit, making such a Babell of confused vtterances, that
neither were his words retained, or respected; which perceived by Adunatus,
who pressing forward with his horse, as a signal of somewhat he had to say,
the people instantly were calmed, and he lifting up his Beuer, thus spoke.

Fire (my noble Lords) is never quenched with swords; nor well grounded
resolutions altered with weak persuasions; then why go you about by air to
alter that which even by the destinies I persuade my self is foredoom'd and
decreed; the offer is noble and not to be refused, the reasons strong and not
to be refelled, and my self willing, neither by any other adventure
whatsoever to be withdrawn or concealed; for a seal to which noble deed I
beseech you all, my Lords, remember and publish this my protestation. First, I
protest this hapless Queen to be virtuous, immaculate and innocent, of all
her unkind husbands imputations: and since she has no accuser but his
jealousy, even to that jealousy, and that tongue which has been the Herald
to that jealousy, I hear denounce the lie, and will with this constant hand
guided with my resolved heart, be ready to defend the same against Amphialus,
the world, or by whom so ever I shall be called.

He had no sooner made this protestation, but the people gave a great showte,
and the Nobility seeing how this deluge had drowned all their former
resolutions, with unwilling willingness gave consent to the motion, decreeing
the execution should be deferred, and messengers dispatched through all the
foreign parts of Christendom, to give notice to Amphyalus, of all that had
passed in their proceedings: but Euronusa loath to leave Hellen in the hands of
her executioners, fearing either the hate of age might work hurt for policy;
or the flattery of youth might fail in a distressed fortune, she humbly he
sought the Lords of Laconia, that they would deliver unto her the unhappy
Queen, whom by the vows of her princely word, and all the obligations which
could tie so great an Empress, she solemnly swore to bring forth unto them
again upon forty days warning, whenever they should command, for the
trial and hazard of her fortune.

The Nobility, as willing a little to flatter Hellen, whose best fortunes were
not altogether confounded, as loath by her detaining to give larger limits to
her hatred, consented to the Queens requests, and accepting her princely word
for her redeliuerie, in most humble manner gave the woeful Hellen to the noble
Euronusa's protection, excusing much of that inexcusable course, which with
such wilfulness they had pursued. Now was the meeting of these two Queens
full of passion and delight: Passion in their woes, Delight in the excellency
of their woes: but after a little enterchange of sorrow (which humor though of
some it be held base and coward; yet of others it is esteemed the ornament of
Age, Virtue, and Continence) they having in their embracements and kisses, told
the tongue-tied message of their herts, began now in solemn sort to take their
leaves of the Lords and States of Laconia; the woeful Queen Hellen, in her
silence, showing that she desired nothing which themselves did not first
desire. But Phalantus humbly craving her to measure his doings by the power he
had to do, and not to let his silence condemn what his busy thoughts were in
labor to bring to pass, besought both the Queens to accept his service, and
that they would vouchsafe him leave, to attend them into the I Will Tenedos. The
Queens right gratefully accepted his offer, and so after many acco^pliments
twixt him and the worthy Adunatus, they departed on upon their journey, where
having past through the Country of Lacenia, and a great part of Peloponesus,
without any adventure worthy noting, they came at length to those sands which
lie against the I Will Cythera, from whence by an even line they may pass to
Tenedos; there they found attending for the Queen Euronusa six Galleys, which
had formerly wasted her over; into which so soon as the Queens were ready to
enter, the most excellent Adunatus, with a countenance as full of Majesty as
love, (yet never any countenance more dearly beloved) humbly besought the
Queens that he might attend them no further in that journey, but that like
an exammated carkas, or a soul-lesse man (for other he protested he was not) he
might spend some few days in the quest of his friend, whose absence was unto
him the absence of all comfort whatsoever, which friend (he saind) he had lost
by shipwreck immediately before his encounter with the Queen Euronusa; to
this entreaty he adjoined a solemn oath, and an inviolable protestation, once
ever in forty days to give notice to the Queens, where, or in what place he
remained, that whenever he should be called, either by Amphyalus, or any
other, he would be prepared to give an account, both for his own, and the
desolate Queens fortune.

The Queens grieved at his desire, yet were loath to grieve at any thing he
should desire, loath in themselves to countermaund any his demaundes, yet
wishing a power to command his demaundings, with tears in their eyes (the
true messengers of their loves) and humbleness in their looks (perfect badges
of their obedience) they answered him, that since in his virtues was the
felicity of their lives, and that as lesser Spheres they were only moved by
the power of his greatness, it became them not either to question or
contradict, only this they besought him to imagine, that his presence was unto
them as the Suns fair beams to the storme-wrackt Mariner, and his absence
like the hour of indurance in the house of affliction; but since his content
must be begot by their discontents, they were willing to be pleased with their
greatest discomfort.

Thus after innumerable tears shed, and many hearty departures, the Queen
having appointed her choysest Galley to attend the Prince in his journey,
giving him sundry most rich jewels for the testimonies of her friendship, they
went all aboard, the two Queens, and Phalantus, directing their journey for
Tenedos the Prince Adunatus holding his course for Cythera, and the lower
Islands, but there he found nothing but that he would not have found, a certain
absence of his friends presence: thence he returned back into Greece, to see
if at the Olympian games he were present; but the sports were to him wearisome,
or not at al because Thaumastus was not there at all: from the Olympian games,
he went to the games Pithii (celebrated in the honor of Apollo) but found them
lonely, because without his friends company, from thence to Corinth, and to
the strait of Isthmus, to see if at the games Isthumi, (founded by Theseus in
the honor of Neptune,) his friend might be found; but no place yielding him
the comfort of his friend, he grew comfortless in himself. Thence he went to
the games Nemei; thence in Creete, to see if at Pirrhus dance he were
present: but finding every place as speechless as himself was hopeless,
he directed his way-vp into Thessalia, where having travailed some few days,
he came to the skirts of the Mountain Ossa, whose well-raised Brow seemed to
be a counsell-keeper with the Firmament, and whose well proportioned hugeness,
and well apparelled beauty, testified the great diety of our first grandame
Nature. Keeping his way by this mountain, he arrived at the head of the river
Penaus, whose smooth delicacie, and delicate smoothness, did forcibly inuit
the eye of the traveler, to wonder at the smoothness. Here the Princes horse
finding his masters care, careless of his labor, began to tire, and with a
sudden stop taught him to know, that violence is without continuance:
whereupon the Prince alighting from his back, and plucking off his Bridle,
gave him leave to feed upon the choysest grass, whilst himself withdrawing
himself into a goodly wood of Pine-trees near adjoining, where thinking to
make the neglect of sleep a comfort to over busy care, he began to lay
himself down under the Canopie of a goodly Pine, but a little keeping his eyes
open, that they might after close with more safety, he might behold hard by
him a thick, dark, and most obscure groaue, where bramble, Thorn, and Brier,
had with so many interlacings and interchangeable windings, knit and co-vnited
their branches together, that the all-pearcing Sun had not power to dart his
smallest beams through the wydest Casement; at this the Prince a little
amazedly looking, thinking that Nature should not bestow so great Art upon so
base matter, he might behold (though half obscured with the lesser trees) a
little Arch, which men might imagine a door, yet such a door as would scarce
give entrance to a Pigmy without stooping, so cunningly cut through the mids
of the thicket, that it gave the eye a little more liberal passage into the
bowels of that night-like darkness. The Prince wondering at his imaginations,
which presented him with nothing but imaginary wonders might at last perceive
come creeping upon his hands and knees through that little Arch a most
decreeped and aged old man, who with the help of his Crutch (the only
companion of his weakness) raising himself from the ground, he discovered
the only Monument of Nature, Time, and man's weakness; his bald-head circled
with a few milk-white hairs, and his long gray beard girdling his withered
cheeks, looked like the flakes of snow upon the Alps, or Pyreneans: his
hollow eyes hid in red cabarets, never weary of weeping for their youths
wantonness, looked like two decayed Lamps, whose Oil was consumed; next his
skin he wore haire-cloath for repentance, and upon it a gray gown for warmth,
which maintaining life, made more large his repentance. At his girdle his
Beads, in his hand a Book, whose leaves were worn with often turning, and
sullied with the tears of his true contrition. Thus being come forth to suck
up the air of this wholesome place, sitting down upon a neighbor bank unto
the grove, and lifting his eyes to heaven, the Prince might hear him deliver
these or such like speeches.

O Ambition, thou neighbor unto Kings, companion with greatness; why do thou
bewitch us with society, yet give the first taste of solitariness? why
seek thou to be alone, yet vsurpest on many kingdoms? O it is not thy
dietie over us, but the sickness of our souls within us, which Reason and
Wisdom must cure, else can no place or distance recover: thou do present the
shape of loneliness to make us alone miserable. But rest with thine unrest in
the bosom of greatness, whilst I salute thee my true solitarines, thou which
make Content depend upon our selves, and vntiest the knots which binds us
unto others, gaining unto men this triumph, that in living solitarily men live
at ease, thou which ever presents unto our minds the Idaeaes of Virtue, whose
well ordered government sets in order all disordered imaginations, containing
man's self in himself, without the assistance or help of foreign society
bringing unto man's knowledge all true felicity, which enjoyed (according to
the measure of understanding) rests in himself satisfied without further
ambition of long life or vainglory; Lo (sacred Pan) this is my true and
pure Phylosophie, which inspired by thy God-heade makes blisse-full my
solitariness. And here he paused as if his breath had enuyed his utterance, or
his heart been grieved, that he should throw into the air the Heaven of her
cogitations, at which the Prince arysing up, seeing there was no hope of
further meditation, and putting off his Helmet that the cheerfulness of his
face might bannish the terror of his armor; with a majesty full of beauteous
love, and lovely courtesy, he saluted the old man, wishing him those happy
hours which might make age most happy, and that life, which to those years
might neither be tedious, nor loathsome, Desiring him therewithal strst to
let him know the condition of the soil wherein he now was, next the state
of his old age, and solitarye abiding: lastly, what adventures were
vnachieued, which might bring honor to the virtuous.

Excellent son (said the old man) for I dare not call thee Pyrophylus,
least in denying thy name thou give me cause to suspect thy virtue, know this
soil whereon thou treadest, is a part of Thessalia, one of the most
fruitfullest, and delectablest Provinces in all Greece, this Mountain is
called Ossa, yond River Penaus, which glyding with gentle pace, twixt it and
Olympus waters and beautifyeth the only excellent work of Nature, and
Garden of the world the Thessalian Tempe, for my self I am called Eugenio,
whom nintie nine Winters has Frost-nypt, and distempered, and as many Summers
has Sunne-burnt and inflamed; I have seen the change of many Kings, and many
alterations in Religion: Men call me Prophet, but I profess my self only a
Priest unto the great God Pan, whose Chapel stands within this groaue, and
on whose Altar I daily burn the sacrifice of the righteous: As for adventures
in this place, though there be none so worthy as may by due make challenge to
thy virtue, yet be there some so virtuous as please thee to approve, will
add much to thine infinite goodness.

The Prince hearing himself called by his own name, in a place where ever
till that time he had been an utter Stranger, and with all understanding,
how near he was unto the Paradise of all delights, the Thessalian Tempe, the
report whereof had in former time so inchaunted his ears, that his heart could
have no quiet, till his eyes might be made the Judges of such notable
perfections, but above all and which in him had a Superlatiue government,
exceeding all (the promise of some virtuous adventure) grew so much surprised
with amazement, and that amazement seconded with such an irresistable Desire,
that persuading himself his only dear friend, the renowned Thamastus (being
the ground of his desire) could not be absent from a place so infinitely
desired; with a most humble courtesy mightily remarkable in such an heroycall
spirit, taking the old man by the hand, said.

Most holy Priest, and divine father of contemplation, in whose breast the
heavens have locked up the treasure of their counsels: vouchsafe, I beseech
thee, (unto me a man) to discharge those knowledges, which may concern the
honor I profess, or the relief of any innocent creature distressed; and I
protest that all-be the life I have lost being mine own life, lodged in the
bosom of one by much many decrees dearer then my breathing, calls me to an
howerly quest of mine only beloved; yet for virtues sake (father) which has
ever been my Goddess, and for your own sake, whom I find to be Virtues
admirer, I will not spare any time or danger to accomplish what thy reverence
shall think meet for mine undertaking.

The old man replied; son sit down by me upon this green bank, and I will
tell thee a story of much cruelty, more inconstancy, but most almighty
love; wherein if thou shall hear any thing to grieve thee, with Democretes
laugh at the worlds vanity: if any thing to make thee smile, weep with
Heraclytus, that love should make Reason foolish: what ever thou hear,
apply to this present age, and say the world is old, and must needs go upon
Crutches With that the Prince sitting down, and locking his attentive ears
unto the old man's speech, Eugenio thus began.

This Country of Thessalia, amongst all his neighbor Kingdoms, was ever held
in singular account, as well for the stately situation, fruitful soil, and
fair buildings, as for the noble inclination of the people, who hated
disobedience as the image of a barbarous nature, and ambition as an engine to
overthrow the Towers of great ones; but above all, her honor has of late
been especially advanced through this miracle of Time and Nature: this
excellent composition of all terrestrial perfections, I mean this most famous
Tempe, which being but a small plot of ground in comparison of the great
kingdom of Arcadia, dares yet to make boast of her Shepherds, of her flowers,
and of her sheep revenues. This Tempe was at first called Natures Eden,
because in it was no part of man's workmanship; yet the work in Art more
strange the^ the Art or work of man could correct; the trees did not ouergrow
one another, but seemed in even proportions to delight in each others
evenness: the flowers did not strive which should be supreme in smelling, but
communicating their odours, were content to make one intyre sweet savor; the
beds whereon the flowers grew, disdained not the grassie Allies, but lending
to them their luster, made the walks more pleasant; the fair river Penaus
would at no time ouerflow his banks to drown their beauties, but with gentle
swellings wash them like a deawie morning: the springs did not challenge the
river, because his water was not as theirs, so wholesome, but paying their
tribute into his bosom, made him able to bear ships of burden; the houses
were not angry that there were Arbors for pleasure, but shadowing the^ under
their hie roofes, did safeguard them from tempests? what shall I say, Tempe
wanted nothing that could make it fair, yet all that it possessed made it but
most beautiful, in so much that the most famous and ever to be admyred Prince
Musidorus, after his return fourth of Arcadia into his Thessalia with his
Pamela, in remembrance of his Shepherds life, and in honor of that life; in
which he had got the honor of his contentme^t, taking a curious survey both of
Tempe and all her best beautyes, he immediatlye built himself a most curious
house, even in the midst thereof, where wanting nothing that might breed
delight, he found the excess thereof did breed sometimes a loathing of
pleasure, near unto his own house, and round about the bordering skirts of
this Tempe, he built many prettye and convenient cottages; in which he
placed certain Shepheardes whose well tempered minds (finding the ambition of
better advanced people, smallye avail to the attainement of true felicitye)
are the only schools to teach their forrayne Neighbors, that their
industrye and providence neither gives hope of disturbance, nor example of
general or private quarrel: into this place he would seriously retire
himself in the void time of his progress, as much to renew his remembrance
with his past knowledges as to better his instant knowledge with new matter
worthy of most excellent remembrance, so exceeding wittye were the
Shepheardes by him there placed, and so much excellencye did his presence
administer to them which were but simplye witted; near unto his own house,
he buylt a fair and sumptuous Temple Circular and in form of the ancient
Jews Sinagogue the outside of marble, containing fifty Arches, every Arch a
door, each door seven windows, each window seven Pyllasters of Iet, and
porpherye, each pillaster, seven images of the Saints, Sages, and worthies of
past ages. This Temple he dedicated to the great Goddess Diana, and indowing
it with a Metropolitan authority, subjected not only unto those laws (which
laws are engraven in certain Pillars of Copper and Marble, adjoining to the
Temple and other places) the Residents, home borne, and strangers in that
province, but even himself his crown and succession; In this place, and in
this rural company, he took a more then most contented delight, they
seeking by Eglogues, pastoralles, shepheardly contentions, and other sports of
wit and courage, as running, leaping, wrastlinge, throwing the Darte, the
Stone, and the Massye axel-tree to ingrafte in his settled Judgment a settled
continuance of those harmles commendations. This continuing the happy days of
this more happy King, death coming to challenge his subject nature, and taking
from the eye of the world, what the worlds eye most dearly esteemed, (I mean
this renowned Musidorus) he left behind him as the only heir of his
Kingdom and perfections, the alone incomperable Mellidora, natures wonder: the
Muses subject, and the Book of Beautye: the day of delight: the life of love:
and the Jewel of eternitye. But she to whom the strangenes of grief made the
evil shape thereof by many degrees much more ouglye, took such an incurable
surfait through her impatience, that esteeming no commandment (the Fates
having taken away her only commander) she gave herself clearly from the
commandment both of her own and other passions, and by no persuasion would
either take care for the common wealth (to her by her Fathers death so deeply
engaged) not comfort in the Crown, without which the great man imagines there
can be no true felicity; for which error, when the Sages of her Kingdom had
with an humble chyding showed her the faults of her will, and the office of her
calling, in the one, painting the effects of her weakness; in the other, the
seal which must advance her to eternal happiness; she with a sad resolution
made them this answer.

I know my Lords (as sound men do) the effects of Physic, but cannot digest
taste of the potions: I know mine evil, but my passion ouer-rules me;
therefore I beseech you, be suffering as my self will be patient, give me the
name, take upon you the nature of mine office; rule you my Kingdom, let me
only rule my thoughts: deal you with reasonable men, whilst I deal with
unreasonable passions: for I protest I will intermeddle with no subject but the
subject of my sorrows. To what end (fair Prince) shall I wade further into
the Laborinth of her woes? suffice it me thus to say, the virtuous Melidora,
referring the government of her kingdom to a well chosen Senate, and betaking
her self with a convenient retinue of Ladies and attendants, into this
delicate Tempe, has ever since her fathers death lived Nymph-like, exercising
hunting, throwing the Dart, running, and such Goddesse-like pleasures, wherein
she does so far exceed all possible imaginations, that if Cephalus himself
were yet living, he would become a suter for her knowledge: Into this Tempe is
prohibited by an especial Edict upon pain of death, the approach or arrival
of any Prince, Nobleman, or other of City quality; the innocence of the
place desiring no commercement, but with innocent creatures, except only at
that time when the young Princes of Delphes came to offer to Apollo their nine
years Sacrifice. Into this place not long sithence, there is come a young
Shepherd, whose name is Thirsis, borne (as he says) in Pelagonia, and
recommended thither by especial Letters from diverse of the ancient Shepherds
of Arcadia, who having Wit the contriuer, and Money the means which only in
this age does advance fortunes, falling into acquaintance with a silly
block-headed swain called Corridon (one who made folly his best wisdom, and
extreme ignorance the depth of his best knowledge) has purchased from him,
both his flock, and the privileges belonging to his flocks keeping. This
Coridon becoming now a servant unto Thyrsis, who to attain the pleasures of
the soil, would not have disdained to have called him master,: All-be I may
justly say without the fear of reprehension, this Thirsis has showed himself
so excellently endewed with all the admirable parts of perfection, that he may
worthily be termed the miracle of this age he lives in; his youth being in
the May time of his flourish, exceeded with a most exceeding beauty, which
beauty rauishing all eyes, was bettered by virtue that did astonish hearts;
his judgments tempered with much knowledge, his knowledge coupled to a demure
silence; what shall I say, so excellent were his good parts, that he wanne
love in his companions, and admire in strangers, every one imitating his
actions for their praises, and alleging his words as their best authorities.
But as we see the Curtain of the night takes from our eyes the glory of the
day, yet is the days return no less beautiful; so a little Melancholy
drawn on by a mighty love distempering his soul, brought him to the use of
much solitariness, which solitariness like a sly enemy, seeking to steal
the mind from the body, clothing himself in the roabes of virtue and divine
contemplation, so imprisoned Thirsis under the arrest of his passions, that in
the end he began to forsake all company; sports he contemned, pastoralles
he neglected; his profits wayned, his flock wasted, and himself consumed;
which being by all his neighbors with much pity noted, was by many of his
best wishers infinitely lamented, especially by a famous Forrester thereby,
named Siluagio, whose better profession brought him to a better feeling of the
minds infirmityes, and whose best love being by a strong bond of not to be
cancelled faith tied unto Thirsis and his virtues, called him now forth to
seek some cure for his friends malady, whereupon ranging up and down
through every Desert, by path and unfrequented harbor, he might at last
behold the most pensive Shepherd lying under the protection of an old
withered Oak, whose aged arms being the witnesses of his intolerable woes,
seemed to be more old through his lamentings, which lamentings made even the
air in tears to lament for company. After Siluagio had well undertaken the
sight of the sad Shepherd, his eyes commanding his feet to stay, least the
sodainnesse of his approach might be stained with an unfriendly welcome; yet
with great priuacie, drawing so near, that his ears might be copartners of
the words which the loving Shepherd delivered, after some little pawse he
might hear him unto his Pype sing this Sonnet following.

IN vain my wits you labor to excuse,
The ugly torments of my care-slaine mind,
Alleging Reasons, Reason to abuse,
Sense made by love a slave by passion blind:,
O wit that do to appite appear,
Like Princes flatterers smooth and delicate,
Keeping an open passage to that ear,
Whereto thy Mermaids songs are dedicate;
Delude me now no more, but let me see,
The naked Image of my forlorn thought,
Show me the great woes in my love which be,
And those much greater my despair has wrought,
Nay show me that which of woes greatest is,
My follies fault, to love and sure to miss.
After he had sung this song, throwing himself upon the ground, and folding
his arms one within another, he began to complain in this manner.

Miserable, forlorn, and dejected that I am, how often has the cry of my
complaints, and the sad sorrow of my speech compelled the hard rocks, the
senseless trees, and the humble shrubbes, to a shiuering pity? and how often
(alas) have thou my Pype intyced the Valleys, Meadows, and running Springs,
with a silver Echo to reply unto my sad sighing, and in a murmuring fashion
to bear the burden of my lamentation? But since I find thou have no power to
breath pity nor sweetness, which may stir compassion in that most excellent
breast, whose divine resolutions holds the determination of my life, even as my
heart breaks, break my Pipe: and with that, breaking his Pipe into as many
pieces as his heart was mangled with many torments, he fell into a swou^d, which
perceived by Siluagio, to whom friendship presented the cause of pity, and
pity the effect of speedy assistance, he ran unto the Shepherd, and
folding him in his ^^^es, after life had got a little upper hand of passion,
he spoke thus unto him. What means my Thirsis? these confounding agonies which
rather makes thee trouble these fair springes with the deluge of thy tears,
then give comfort to the Sky by thy divine melody? But Thirsis casting his
countenance upon Siluagio, yet such a countenance, as rather commanded Pity
to suffer, then Wisdom to chide the error of his passion, said unto him. Ha
Siluagio, Siluagio, I am eue^ like unto my Pipe, whose tune is answerable to
the fingers touch, when it strikes it; for if the touch be smooth and soft, the
hermony is pleasant; if rude and rough, it iarres and distasteth the hearers,
and so of my self; My songs are lamentations, touched with the bitterness of
sorrows fingers; O but yet (said Siluagio) let me conjure thee, first by our
loves, which even Sauadges have accounted an honorable friendship; next by the
pleasures of our former meetings, when with the eagernes of our desires, we
have atte^ded the Nimphs in their chasings; and lastly for the Muses sakes, who
as true Mystresses of Memory, enrich thee with those conceits which shall
out-liue all remembrances, that thou will vouchsafe to discharge thy sorrows
into my bosom, wherein if my counsel cannot amend, yet shall not mine endeavors
end, til I endeavor to end thy misfortune.

He grieves not Siluagio (said Thirsis) that can tell how much he grieueth,
for heavy cares sit heavy on the soul, they be but light shadows, which
leap from the tongues vttererance: yet if it please thee to sit down, and
lean against this tree, I will be content to disclose, what to these woods,
this bank, these bushes, yond streams, and these Birds I have long since
disclosed, only to no Shepherd it is revealed, and yet me thinks, since I
feel my death so near, twere fitter to conceal my folly, and only grave it
in some tender bark, by which my body shall be interred, that when the
Goddess shall pass by for whose sake I consumed, she may tryumphing say, Lo
here lies the victory of mine eyes, and my beauties conquest; But Siluagio
impatient to be delayed, began again to importune him with such
irresistable persuasions, that thus in the end Thirsis began to deliver his
fortunes.

At such time Siluagio as every Budde began to make his tender leaf appear
upon the earth, and that every woody Querrister skipping from bough to bough,
chaunted fair welcomes to the Springes first coming, my self lying under the
shadow of a pretty bush, tuning my Pype to the delicacye of their sweet
notes, made in my conceit so harmonious a consort betwixt Art and Nature,
that the poor fools in their contentment seemed to play and dance about me.
In the midst of this sportiue merryment, like a nimble Roe, came the fair
Milidora tripping by; her hair in most lovely quantity, hanging about her
shoulders, which the winds being in love withal, most sweetly kissing, not
rudely stirring, seemed in their gentile motion to quiver like the Aspen
leaves; as I perceived she came for counsel to a holy Fountain hard by, to
tie them all up again in a well ordered proportion: which done, she cast a
veil of silver over the rich. Mine of that golden treasure, and bordering that
veil with a Corronet of all the flowers that ever Mother-nature could boast
of, for either smell or color, she seemed in mine eye much brauer, and more
sumptuously adorned then either Iunoes Bird, or the statue of Venus: O how me
thought the Sun did stop, stand still, admyre, and gazing, seemed ever
desirous to gaze upon her: the stately Trees bowed their tall heads to honor
her that gave an honor both to the heavenly and earthly mansion; her beautye
me thought was the spring time to our Fields, the comfort to our Flocks, and
the only food to the souls of men living. But whilst in the gloriousness of
this eternal glory, she traced about the bank of the fountain, viewing her
face in the crystal water; me thought I saw a blush like lightning break
from the sky of her countenance, and she smiled to see how the beautye of her
face staynd all the other beautyes with which she was adorned, whereby she
appeared to say thus within her self; Alas I stick not these flowers about me
to adorn my beauty, but to disgrace their own glories, when every creature
shall behold how exceedingly I exceed them; But see alas Siluagio whilst thus
my laboring imagination presented these delights to my desiring soul, the
most excellent Princess tourning about her fair quick eye (O eyes to whom
all eyes are homagers) spyde the bush to move wherein I was so safely
coutched; whereat as mistrusting treason to her person, she slung down her
flowers, and like the light winds which scorn to press the grass in their
motion, fled from my presence, being the lightest Nymph on foot that ever
was beheld by eye or by imagination; And here with a big-swelling sigh, he
stayed from further speaking, till Siluagio a new reviving his remembrance,
desired him to proceed and show what effects sprang from the cause of this
enterviewe: This, this (quoth Thirsis) I instantlye felt a boiling Spring arise
in my heart, which with a bubling murmr, making his passage through every
Vein and Artery of my body, like the shallowe stream which breaks his way
through the pibble stones, incited me with a new desire to follow her, but
being withheld by Obedience, I was content to perrish with Love, But (said
Siluagio) did you never see her since? yes, yes, (quoth. Thirsis) in Damson time
when it pleased her amongst the Nymphs and Shepherds to gather the early
fruit of the Summers rypening, she commanded me to mount up into the Trees,
and to shake the plumbes down into her lap: O how I did envy the senseless
fruits happiness to see it fall and sport upon that bosom, where even Gods
and Angels might have been proud to have reposed; yet did this favor so
enrich my fortune, and my serviceableness draw on the favor of further
service, that when it pleased this Princess (or rather Goddess) at any time
for her delight to go angle in the lesser brooks, only I was commanded to
provide the baytes, I only had the charge of her hook, of her line and her
angle; how often I kissed the Cane, because her hand in touching had kissed it, how
often I imbraste the line that had been wantonlye entangled about her, how often
in my deliuerye I stole the touch of her prettye fingers, Judge Love, Judge
Lovers, judge all that are beloved. O God yet me thinks I see with what
delight the silly fish would glaunce at Melidoras beauty through the glassie
stream, whilst deceived with her bayte she had struck them all with her
hook, only the last nibled so long about the line, that when the Princess
thought to pull her pray to the shore, the murdering hook it self was taken
quite away; at which sight my passion quickening my blood, and my blood reviving
the spirrit of my words: I could not forbear to say, behold thou all
conquering Empress of men's hearts, the glorious blaze which this angling
beautye lays to catch men's souls, shall even in this manner be gnawne and
taken away by the Iron teeth of consuming time; and where shall then be the
future power of killing? yet lovely Maid triumph over me, whom you have
already taken, even me that like this simple frye delight in my perishing, and
if you do (as your fair eyes are witnesses) bemone the fish which has
swallowed down your hook, whose lingering torment is a sign of certain
death; then pittye me your slave, the merryt of whose affection shall far
exceed the compassion due to any unreasonable creature. And what (said
Siluagio) did the Princess answer to this pretty gloze? Sparks of
displeasure (said Thirsis) flew with such a disdain from her eyes, that I was
even Phaeton-like thunder-strooke from the Chariot of mine ambition, whilst
casting her lovely countenance to the humble earth, and knocking her silver
chinne against her Iuorye bosom, with a silence that spoke as much as could be
understood by Anger, threw down her angle, and departed from my presence, her
departure telling me that the ending of her sportes should be the continuance
of mine affliction;

Can thou not (said Siluagio) by neglecting her, fashion thine eye to find
some other object? How shall I find other (answered he) and in her have lost
my self? By forgetting her remembrance (said Siluagio.) She is my
remembrance (answered Thirsis) and will not be forgotte whilst I retain my
memory. Then sue again (said Siluagio) thy tears may extorte some pittye; I
dare not (cryde Thirsis) least I offend her patience: Why tell me (said
Siluagio) what if she were within this Forest begyrt with Tigers, Lions, or
with Savage Beasts? I durst (quoth Thirsis) attempt her in such a case,
because it were a rescue for the precious Jewel of her life; What (said
Siluagio) if thou sawst her taken by Thieves, by Satyrs, or by wild Sauadges?
Why (quoth Thirsis) I durst charge an Army to relieve her honor: What Rock
so steep that for her sake I would not climb? What Flood so deep that for
her I would not sound? What flame would I not endure? What frost would I not
suffer? nay, what Hell would I not ransacke with Hercules, so that the end of
my labor might but bring my love within the look of entertainment? Believe
me (said Siluagio) she were Flynt it self, if she heard thee, and did not
yield thee the favor of her countenance: but come, arise my Thirsis, and cast
off this sorrow being no attrybute to Virtue, but rather the Title of
malignitye, being ever an hurtful foolish quality, full of base thoughts and
cowardice. Arise I say, and as we walk along, I will (if thou please) to kill
thy passion, show thee the errors of thy passion: or if otherwise thy taste
cannot endure such bitterness, I will to flatter thy Love, speak much in
Loves commendations: well (said Thirsis) since thy knowledge is so well able
to declaime of every faculty in our pssions, I am content both to attend
thee, and lend thee mine attention, so that in thy discourse thou exceed not
the limits of modesty, by speaking against love, (to whom I am a slave,) nor
against beauty (to whose perfections I am an eternal inthralled prisoner.)
And with that Thirsis arising from the ground, walked along with Siluagio,
hoping ere long to find some occasion which might occasion him to retire to
his former solitariness: and in their walking, Siluagio began thus to
discourse unto him.

Of all the excellent humors, wherewith the mind of man does commerce, or find
it self busied (my Thirsis) there is none either more hot, more sharp, or
more full of prayse-worthie action, then this of love: which how ever more
colder capacities shall entitle Ague-like uncertain observing fittes and
times, without either modest stayednesse, or constant perseverance, yet in the
well settled judgment of the virtuous, it is found a general fame of an equal
composure, constant, and firm, smooth and sweet, not raising desires beyond
the Moon, nor pursuing Tantalus fruit, which flies us in following, neither
does it when wills are united and married together (as men suppose) mourn and
consume, as if ending in enjoying, but enjoys according to the excellency of
the desire that holds it, retayning a spiritual residence in a mind made pure
with long use and custom, excelling all other affections and passions of the
mind, like a most excellent picture that is bordered about with Antike
Boscage, or Crotesko works of slight estimation. This love is not the most
fruitlessest and base of all Passions, as being begot by Desire and Sloth, as
working upon weak hearts and frenzies, as only accompanying mutinous
passions, and discomfortable ielousies; and in the end aspyreth to a minutes
Delight, which is vsherd with much pain, and followed by an eternal future
repentance: No, no, my Thirsis, true love, and true lovers do mingle and
confound themselves so in each other, with a general mixture, that they
out-weare and loose the port or gate of their first entrance, Reason being
taken away, and a more excellent and more fatal power made Mistress of that
never to be untied union: these passions which they feign to be his consorts,
are sicknesses of the mind, which envying loves exquisiteness, seek with
their poisons to confound his beauties, but in the end, like clouds betwixt
the Sun and our eiesights, do but darken love, that when love breaks out,
it may be more resplendant.

As Siluagio was thus going on, and discoursing, praising love with disprayses,
Thirsis whose mind was busyed about much higher thoughts, would suffer his
ears to retain nothing, save only the sound of his speeches, till in the
end lifting up their heads, they might epsy the only Paragon of this
worlds knowledge the excellent Melidora, somewhat a far off, coming in the
self same path in which themselves walked, in so much that except they
retired, they must perforce meet her eye to eye, and visage to visage. She
was Nymph-like clothed in sundry colored silks, which being placed one
upon another were of an equal distance, one shorter then another, the in-most
being longest, as brauing of his most inward and familiar acquaintance, yet
all of them joining their beautyes together, made round about her an
arteficiall Rayne-bowe, her hair being wound up in a lace of gold, was
intermingled with many Flowers; all which beauties as if they had been too
glorious for heaven, or to rich for earth, were shadowed and all ouer-cast with
a large veil of white Cypress.

In this sort she was returning from the Temple of Diana, that day being the
great Saboath dedicated to the Goddess, whereby the ancient ordinances and
edictes of that place, all the Nymphs are to make their personal appearance,
and to offer solemn sacrifice, and other private ceremonies to the Queen of
Chastitye, being all vaylde from the iudyciall censure of the eyesight, least
the misprision of a blush, or the attaindure of a pale look should give
occasion to a wanton thought to misdeeme innocence,

In this Temple upon this day, if there be found therein or after knowledge
bring to light that there might have been found therein any man or creature
of the Male kind, it is present death without appeal or justification. In
this sort like the glorious Sun in his noone-tyde progress, came she
tracing along the vallyes, her pretty foot scarce pressing down the flower
that it troade upon. But Thirsis eyes, which long before had taken a full
draught of her beauty, being now lightning, struck with the beams of her
presence, wanting power to retire, his soul being retired from al power to
command his intendments; amazedly stood still with fixte eyes, swollen heart, sad
thoughts, stiff joints, and all the terrors that could accompanye Love in his
desperate estate; till Siluagio whose unrefined spirit did more wonder then
retain the remembrance of what he wondered at, awakning Thirsis intranced
soul, with earnest persuasions, desired him once more to encounter the
Goddess of his fortunes, alleging that stale hope which is ever most
hoplesse; that she was a woman and there was no impossibilities. But Thirsis
who having once seen Disdain, carried ever after his remembrance in his
bosom, like an affrighted child, that hides his head when the nurse talks of
a Bugge-beare, would feign have gone aside from his sorrow, telling Siluagio it
was but labor lost, since both her greatness, virtue, and chaste thoughts, were
in this conflict his mortal enemies. But Siluagio, taking upon him the power
of Reason to overthrow Passion, with a frie^dly vpbraiding of Thirsis
timerousnesse, by no means would be withstoode, but would force perforce,
enforce him to meet the Princess, saying: who dares not adventure, can never
attain; neither he which will not hazard upon peril, shall have the honor of
perils overthrow; therefore advance thy fallen thoughts (my Thirsis) and plead
their humble serviceableness whilst I with-drawe my self into this groaue,
and pray for thy succeding fortunes. At this Siluagio withdrawing himself
apart, yet not so far but that his ears might have part of their conference,
the noble Princess keeping her direct course, and being come even almost to
the place where the loue-thralld Shepherd stood, the poor Swain most humbly
falling upon his knees, gave her this salutation.

For ever may the grass be green (most sacred Nymph) which thou treadest
upon, with thy more dainty feet, and may an eternal Spring flourish in thy
walks, as thine immortal Beauty flourishes in the hearts and eyes of all thy
beholders.

To this salute, the Princess in a pretty silent blush, giving him a slight
thanks, offered to pass by him, as carried away with far greater deseignes
then the note of his favors. But the forlorn Shepherd, who before fearing to
offend, now having given offense, imagining Injury and it to have both but
one merit, staying the Nymph by her sacred garments, and binding his knees
still Apprentices to the base earth, thus seconded his former speech, after
many tears and sighs interruptions.

Thou only Superlatiue of all thy sex, even for thy virtues sake fly not
from thy servants presence, but if it be possible that the desperate anguish of
my love, may raise any appearance of pity in the all-sauing Firmament of thy
sweet, chaste, and sober countenacne, even for the honor of thine own dear
name, unto which all the hearts of Kings are tributarie, send forth some
spark to lighten my dark soul. O shun me not I say, alas it is for the
harmless Lamb to shun the devouring Woolfe; you are too fearful (Lady)
O you are far too timorous, I am your servant, your vassaile, and the work
of your own eyes making; alas I come not to offer violence, but to receive
outrage. Dear Goddess, empty thy Quiver, spend thy Shafts upon my soul, O
stick them up to the feathers in my heart, for well I remember thou did
long since give me that incurable wound, which corsiue like eating my heart,
has confounded my soul; and Reason leaving nothing but thy pity to call me
from eternal bondage. O thou immortal mirror where beauty finds out her
best beauties, thou that art the kingly seat of triumphant love, daine that thy
fair eyes which make the morning blush, which parch heaven, scorch earth, fire
the woods, breaks the frost, flowers the earth, and turns the dark night to
the comfortable day, O let those eyes which are so much the fayrer, by how much
my torment is made greater by them to pity the anguish I have got by gazing
on them.

Melidora with a blushing countenance, whose rosy color gave a sign of
heavenly anger, eyeing the Shepherd with an appauling Majesty, demanded of
him if he were not that Thirsis, who coming but lately into these walks, had
made those curious hooks and baits with which her-selfe and the other Nymphs
had so often taken so many fish? He made her answer, it was he: she demanded
again, if it were not he that had made the curious Nets, wherewith himself
and the Shepherds had taken so many birds? he made her answer, it was he;
why then said Melidora, Shepherd farewell, I will no longer stay with thee,
lest I be likewise taken by thee; but he staying her again, said; Excellent
Lady, how can you be made captive by your prisoner, or how can your subject
alter any of your determinations; alas (most excellent creature) you know my
service has attended you in the woods, in the Meadows, on the Mountains, at
the springs, at the rivers by day, by night, I at every silent time, and yet
has my thoughts bin pure without the stain of villainy: I said Melidora, but
when young desires begin to sting and be inflamed, you give me cause to fear
the effects of frenzy. I hope (said Thirsis) by that to purchase my glory,
when you beholding mine anguish, shall admire my patience; O but you may forget
your self (said Melidora) I Will near forget (said Thirsis) to do that which
shall content you; I Will near attempt that which in my knowledge shall offend you.
I take you at your word (said Melidora) henceforth I charge you that you
forget to love me; for there is nothing in the world can bring my mind better
contentment; again I charge you, that you tarry no longer in my presence, for
nothing in the world is more offensive unto me. Madam (said Thirsis) both
your commands are extreme; yet to the first I must needs make answer, I can
never forget to love you, because all my thoughts do (and must ever so do)
live in you. Why (said Melidora) will you love me in despite of me? O no
(said Thirsis) not in despite, though I cannot retire; Well (said Melidora) if
thy disposition be as full of courtesy, as thy words are of care, avoid from
me, or let me go from thee; I hope (said Thirsis) that Time, who is the
worlds conqueror, will either conquer you, or consume me, I humbly take my
leave. And with that rising from the ground in such an heavy perplexity, that
sorrow was never to be seen in a more sorrowful taking, he departed from
her; and went, not respecting where or whither, only desirous to hide his
head in some dark Cave, where none but Misery and he might live together.

Siluagio that saw him thus depart like a condemned man; and was a witness of
the heavy sentence that she his cruel Judge had pronounced, wondering that
infernal fury should be found in a heavenly body, and cursing nature that
had placed a flintie heart in a silken Cabinet, followed his friend with
infinite pensiveness, as well to prevent the advantage Despair, might take
of grief, as to fortify that wounded hope which now was even at his last
breathing. But Melidora, all-be the excellency of her own disposition, could
have affoorded a more milder repulse, yet at this time her mind being carried
away with such an earnest affection, as may well be comprehended within the
title of love, would not suffer her tongue to deliver any other satisfaction.
And this was the reason:

There is a gallant young Shepherd, who some three years agone, having seated
himself in Tempe, has lived there with much happiness, more admiration, but
most love, his beauty enticing his good disposition confirming, and his virtue
binding unto him, all those with whom at any time he conuersed: His rural
profession was beautified with a Cittie-gouernment; his homely attire had a
courtly fashion, and his plainest discourses were interlyned with witty and
morrall constructions: his words were queint, his behavior civil, and his
desires lofty, insomuch that he was called the courtly shepherd, or the noble
Pastor, exceeding all his fellowe-Shepheards, excepting only the most rare
Thirsis, whom he could exceed in nothing but in the bliss of affection.

This worthy Swain had long time before Thirsis came into these parts with
his noble deseignes, which promised more then could be comprehended in a
country fortune; had so won the heart of the excellent Princess Melidora,
that she did not disdain to call him her servant, and with many graces did so
adorn his blissfulness, that his lofty fortunes might well contend with any
Monarchs greatness, in-so-much that love, who had ever lived prisoner in her
eyes, began to dart his beams into the Shepherds heart, and with a wanton
recoyling, to look now and then down into her bosom, making his daily
service the witness of his assured love; and her Favor an Herald to
pronounce that by possibility she might love. Now it happened that this day
being the great Sabbath of Diana, the Princess had promised her Shepherd
Diatassan (for so was he named) after the Rites and Ceremonies were finished,
to meet him in a most pleasant Arbor, seated in a delicate groaue, dedicated
to the Goddess Chloris, to which none but her self only had private access,
there to discourse unto him the order, the pomp, and the manner of the
Ceremonies, which were due to the great Goddess, and to that end she was
walked forth as before I have rehearsed: and being now entered into the Arbor,
finding her Shepherd not come, taking up a Lute which lay ypon a bed of
flowers hard by, to whose sweet sound coupling her more sweeter voice, she
sang this Sonnet.

I Do not now complain of my disgrace,
O cruel Love, O love too cruel crossed,
Nor of the hour, season, time, nor place,
Nor of my foil for any freedom lost,
Nor of my mind by my misfortune daunted:
Nor of my wit, with ouer-weening struck,
Nor of my sense by any sound inchaunted,
Nor for the force of fiery poynted look:
Nor of the steel that sticks within my wound,
Nor of my thoughts by worser thoughts displaced,
Nor of the life I labor to cofound,
But I complain that being thus disgraced,
Fierd, feared, fettred shot through, slain,
My death is such as I dare not complain.
She had scarce made an end of her song, before the courtly Shepherd
Diatassan entered into the groaue, blushing to see his absence condemned of all
negligent errors by her presence, humbly besought her Majesty to pardon his
slow-footed attenda^ce, alleging the care of his fold, the fear of suspect,
and many other pretty excuses: but above all, he alleged the loss of a most
dainty lamb, which he had most curiously brought up, and wherewith Melidora
was much delighted to play, saying that morning, the cruel wolf had stolen it
away, in-so-much that he pursuing the chase, took the wolf at his pray, and
then had no remedy but to kill him that had killed her play-fellow. Melidora
smiling, made him answer, that if she had not some constant trials of his
loyalty, she should fear lest some violent mischance would either kill, or
take him from her service; but he whose fervent love could induce no cold
suspicion to prophecy his apostacy with more then an usual earnestness,
besought her not to make doubt of his faithfulness, vowing by Heaven, by Earth,
by Love, by the golden treasure of his hopes, by all his comforts past, and by
all his delights to come, and lastly by her sacred self, who was the great
volume which contained the cronicle of his fortunes, that no time, no chance,
no change, nor no admiration, should take from his name the title of her
eternal Admirer, wishing ruin to his body, infamy to his name, and
immortal death to his soul, when his pure thoughts should be blotted with
the stain of disloyalty; and with that kissing her hand, and shedding some
tears thereon, desired her not to suspect him till she was inwardly resolved,
absolutely to kill him; which she promising to perform, they sat down
together upon a flowrie bank within the Arbor, whilst Diatassan calling to
remembrance her former promise, humbly besought her to tell him the manner of
Dianas ceremonies, what was the pomp, the show, and the order of their
sacrifice: to which she thus answered. To tell thee (my Shepherd) at length
without omission, all the stately proceedings due this day to our great
Goddess, neither could a Summers day, nor Winters night, out-last my
discoursings: wherefore we will omit it till a more convenient time for such an
argument; only one accide^t as worthy note as love it self is worthy
memory, which fell out this day in the Temple, I will impart unto thee, and
thus it was.

Amongst all the Nymphs and Mayds, which this day made the Altars of the great
Diana smoke with perfumed Sacrifice, I spyde a virgin, who bestirring herself
like a busy toyling Be, exceeded many of her consorts in praying, in sensing,
in sacrificing, and in singing: by her gestures I could not suspect her
knowledge, her garments I knew not, her face because of her veil I saw not,
and for her speech like the rest, it witnessed unto me that she was a stranger.
After her sacrifices were ascended, and she for her more diuinne contemplation,
retired into a private seat, my self closely stealing from the rest of the
Maidens, came and devoutly joined me to her side, where I had not long seated
my self, but I might perceive she cast many pretty gazes upon me, such as by
the interpretation of affection are said to carry love in their glaunces; at
first I wondered, but at last I encountered her look for look, making love an
excellent linguist only by demonstration; and all-be the race was but short,
yet was there a large field for love to tylt in betwixt each of our gazings; my
face being covered all over with this veil, had only two loop-holes left for
mine eyes to look through, From whence (said this Nymph) she saw such heavenly
glimpses issue, as matched the Sun, which straightened betwixt two clouds, darts
into the world fair lovely beams of enduring brightness; I told her, if in
me there were any of those glories, they only were borrowed from her, and from
her beauty: with that she whispering in mine ear, demanded my name? but I
wringing her softly by the silken hand (and to make my self some pretty
sport by this instant accident) told her that I was a Shepherd, not a Nymph,
and that only for her sake I had disguised my self, fearing not the danger
of my life, because I had none but by her sufferance, meaning in this Temple
and at this holy time, to consecrate my chaste thoughts to her service. She
again demanded of me my name, and I answered her it was Diatassan; And I pray
you Lady (said Diatassan) what answered she to that name? Upon the knowledge
of that name (said Melidora) we concluded, that this night when the Nymphs do
come to fetch water at Mineruaes spring, she shall come the hindmost in the
train, and that I waiting for her in a mazie Thick adjoining, shall as soon
as I perceive the Nymphs to return home, discover my self to her, who
fayning odd tryfles to stay behind them, would administer unto me al
aduau^tage of further conference.

Much other talk we had, but in the end when the rites were ended, she sighing
departed; my smyles ready to break into open laughter to see the poor fool
so cunningly deceived; But what was her name (said Diatassan) she is called
(said Melidora) Apheleia: O what sport will this be for thee and me, when in
the cooling shade amongst the rest of thy fellow Shepherds, we pass away the
time with toys, with Ridles, and with witty purposes: I tell thee this action
will be worthy of a conceited eglogue. And as they were thus discoursing, a
Page belonging unto the Princess, came into the Arbor and brought her word
that all the Forresters were attending her Majesty at the Lodge, to know in
what part of the forest she intended the next day to hunt, that orderly
preparation might be made for her sportes? with that the Princess arysing with
such a gesture as did envy the times swiftnes, she told her shepherd she
must be gone, but he desiring leave to attend her, she earnestly forbad him,
saying the tutret love is the cottage hate, and so she departed, only
accompained with her Page to her own Castle.

As soon as the Princess was gone, Diatassan reuoluing in his mind upon the
adventure she reported, grew into an amazed ecstasy, Desire and Wonder breeding
in his soul a thousand Chymeras and strange imaginations; one while fear
appald him, least doing iniurye to the Princess, he might kill his love and
Favor: then presently Desire inflames him to behold her whose love living
upon his name is derided by fortune. Another while Doubt takes him prisoner,
Reason denying the mind to have such insubstantiall apprehensions; but then
Wonder, resolves him, and bids him but look into the work of his own minds
creation: thus being carried awhile with these variable thoughts, in the end
he absolutelye concludes with himself, that he will go to Mineruas Spring,
and in the groaue adjoining, shilter himself to try what event will issue of
the former passage; And so in the end he did, where having rested till the
Suns departure made the night proclayme her government, he might behold
six beautiful Nymphs with Golden Flagons in their hands, who commning unto
Mineruas spring, before they would dippe their vessels into the holy water,
they in a most comely order walking about the Fountain, sang this Canzonet.

THose foolish women are accursed,
That make of Love a God (though blind)
And under him the worst of worst,
Cover the follyes of the mind.
For us we do detest out right,
The vulgar maxim as untrue:
That he should be a God of might,
Who breeds the cares makes all souls rue.
That takes all reason from desire,
And peece-meale tears the troubled heart,
Being a most consuming fire,
That wastes our inward heavenly part.
But worse accursed are they by much,
That on men's beauties fix their eye,
And think no heavenly comfort such,
As that which in fair looks does lie.
Alas they do too much forget
That love and men are of one mind,
Busy to lay that cruel net,
Which thralles the simple foolish blind:
Returning them most loss at all,
That loves the best, and is most thrall.
After they had sung this song, every one dipping her golden Flagon in the
Fountain, after some little intercourse of speech, wherein one gave praises to
the Goddess Minerua, another commended the virtues of the water, and others
the ordinances of those Ceremonies: In the selfsame comely order as they
came, they now began to return. But Diatassan, who during all the time of
their abode, had with a curious eye beheld the hindmost Nymph of the train,
began to read within the fair story of her beauties, many remembrances of
those ancient thoughts, which had long ago (in the Maydentime of his first
love) infinitely surprised him. Many times, his eyes told him they saw
nothing but that sight which they had most dearly loved. His thoughts told
him they were enriched with no new cogitations, and his heart affirmed, that
but that Image there was none in it perfectly engraven; to be plain, she so
much resembled a worthy Nymph, whom in his first youth he had loved most
sincerely, till injurious Death had made a divorce betwixt their affections,
that even now his reuolting eyes began coward-like to yield to the assault of
her beauty: and not content to yield alone, did so persuade his heart, that
he covetous of new honor, subjected all that was in him to her obedience;
Melidora was now in his mind but like that picture which Zuxis desired to see
under the painted sheet, which was mearly nothing, as having no place or being
all that he was, was but only a scrole of this new affection: And now
beholding Apheleia, both with slow pace, and some slight excuse loiter behind
the rest of her fellow nimphs, he discovered himself, and with a gentle pace
ouertaking her, after his downe-cast looks, and some trembling words, had
like a preface told her, his talk must be all of love; taking up her hand,
and giving it a lovely kiss, he demanded of her if that hand were not the
hand which did prodigally cast into his fruitful breast the fair seed of
blooming fancy, whose ripe harvest shall return her milions of gains; or tell
me fair Nymph (said he) are not these glorious eyes of yours, the warlike
Cytadels where all conquering love sits as in his Empire clothed with the rich
spoils of many kingly overthrows, and for a triumph hangs out his most
beauteous colors? O God they are; and therefore let never any Shepherd fear
Jove's thunderbolts, or in their Carols advance the unconquered sword of the
God of war, but let them all be amazed with thy beauty, and with that
amazement let them record the victories thou have obtained of the world, of
love, and of me thy servant. Well I remember that in the April of my years, I
have been sometimes enticed amongst my fellow Shepherds, to taste the delights
of youths inventions, and in those delights have delighted to approve the
minds of many Maidens, yet never till now have fixed my constant mind of any;
till I saw thee I saw not any that could content me, for whose sake I have
this day desperately adventured my life by coming disguised into Dianas
temple, wherefore (dear Nymph) let the former words which I whispered in thy
dainty ears, the mutual agreement of our hither coming, and the due
attendance I have performed in my service, as the messengers of pity plead for
my merit; and eue^ as with patience I suffer the bitter anguish of my thoughts,
so let love and thy self be courteous to my sad destiny. To this she a^swered;
Fair Shepherd, according to mine agreement, here I make good my promise, yet
not in such sort that by it thou shall suppose I stand entangled in those
foolish snares which you Thessalians call love: but for it pleased thee
(without either Desire in me, or Desert in my perfections) to make so frank
and absolute a gift, of thy heart, of thy soul, and of thy self, to rest ever
at my disposing, so that it should be utterly unlawful for any but me to give,
to retain, to keep, to change, or to dispose any thing within the compass of
thine affection, and that al thy thoughts and actions should maiden-like give a
modest and sincere attendance upon my will, which since I see thou do
effectually perform by this new seconds of thy former love, be thou pleased
with mine acknowledgment, that I have heard thy love: O but (said he) shall the
tender of these my services receive at thy hands no recompense? it is recompense
enough (said she) that I give credit to thy words, and accepta^ce to thy
service. Why then (said he) let this bondage of my love be like those calm
blastes which kindle the fire of delight, whose flame breaking forth into the
world, may make us admyred of all constant beholders. As she was about to
reply unto this speech, she might perceive the rest of the Nymphs looking
back, and staying for her company, which occasioning her with a shamefast
blushing to break off her conference, she told him, their many words might
move many suspicions, which to avoid it was fit that silence should part them,
yet (said she) Fair Shepherd, take this little remembrance, and wear it for
my sake, and with that she gave him a very fair Jewel, wherein was set a most
rich Diamond, cut in the fashion of a Sphere or Globe, and about it was writ
this word, Mauens moueor, and so she departed.

But as soon as his eyes had lost her which was their best object, they
instantly converted their lookings to her costlye favor, on which when he had
with many curious surueys a good space meditated, and had to many cross and
contrary senses, wrested and expounded the cunning devise; at length constantly
beholding the frame of the fair Gloabe, and marking with what course the
reflections, and sparkles like little spheres wound about the foil, which like
the earth (the worlds ce^ter) stood in the midst of the Mund, he could not
forbear to say; Dear Maid, be thou the Sky, and let me be the earth, on whom
gentle love may make the morning lights of grace to arise, and give fair
glory to my darkness: and although this sullen night make thee withdraw from
mine eyes, the beams of thy countenance, O yet let thy favor continually run
about me, and how soever I move, let thy love never be removed from me: many
other passionate speeches to like effect he uttered, with such a feeling
earnestness, that many times he was ready to faint under the weary burden
of his new love; but the day having given up all his authority to the
nights commandment, and Hope a little easing the thraldom of his senses,
seeing new occasions, must give new means to satisfy his longings, pleased
with those slight contentments for that time, he departed homeward toward his
Cottage, where taking no rest but such as attendes the unrest of troubled
Lovers, being only accompained with hopes, with longings, with dispayres,
with Ielousies, with ungrounded desires, and passionate lamentations; he wasted
the weary time of that too long imagined night. But as soon as the Sun began
to strew Roses and Gillyflowers upon the top of the Eastern Mountains, all the Forresters and Shepherds in a most seemly manner, assembled at the lodge
where the fair Melidora lay, ( Thirsis only excepted) whose cares denyde him
the comfort of al recreation; And there the Forresters taking their
siluer-bound Bugles which hung in rich bautriks overthwart their green
liueryes, they winded a shrill rechate unto the Princess, as signal of the
days ready preparation; but she whose untroubled mind was ever prepared to
give entertainment to those worthy sports, issued fourth of her lodge with all
the Ladies and Nymphs of Tempe in her train, so royally adornd, that eue^ the
Goddess of hunting grew paale for anger to see how much her self was
excelled. After she had given a chereful salutation to al her beholders, and
with a quick surueying eye beholding the company, and only missing the
Shepherd Diatassan, blushing for fear she should be seen to blush, she
commanded them that if all things were in a readynes, they should proceed to
the pastimes; with that the Forresters going before with their Iauelines and
darts, and the Shepherds with their hooks guarding each-side of her person,
they passed on toward the Woods, where soon after the Hewee was set, the
toils pytcht, and the Hounds vncoopled; imediately there was roused a fair
and goodly Stagge, whose tel-tale feet that were only betrayers of his life,
were now made the means, and instruments of his best safety: he was no sooner
rousd, and notice thereof given by the sweet redoubling mouths of the hounds,
but imediately the Shepherds with their shouts, the Forresters with their
horns, and the many tong'd Echoes in every corner, made such a delightful
music through the hollownes of the elder grown woods, that like the Phirgian
consort which stirred up such valient spirit in Alexander, it elevated up to
heaven the minds of the hearers: the beast fled, the hounds pursued, and the
Nymphs, Forresters and Shepherds, with several encoragements followed so
swiftly, that he which from the top of some hye Turret might but have beheld
the chasing and rechasing, would well have concluded in that sport, the full
glory of all other pastimes, But during this sport in which the Nymphs and
Shepherds straue by the swiftnes of their nimble feet, who should keep
nearest to the desired game, it happened that Melidora (who in all things so far
excelling, as above al creatures she was most excellent) did so far outstrip
all her attendants whatsoever, that not any was able to keep within the view of
her swiftnes; only one fair Nymph whose name was Ethera sprung of the race
of Atalanta, being only a second to the Princess in running, with much labor
and more desire kept still the sight of her presence, but as it is ever seen
that the violence of pleasure transports our minds and actions beyond the
moderation of delight, the desire we have to enjoy, taking from us the
ability to make us enjoy, so in this absolutely worthy Princess, her too much
earnestnes to pursue her sportes (being arested by wearynes) made her now begin
to distaste sport, and not she alone was weary, but even the poor hunted
beast, first by many counter-courses, and often tappishing, and lastly by taking
soil in a great lake not far of, showed how near he was come to the last
point of his utter ruin; yet the water not speaking so plain language as the
earth, was a means whereby the hounds came to an utter default, which she
perceiving, and therewithal calling into her remembrance, how by her following
she was fled from all company, having not any near her, either within view or
hearing, save only the nymph Ethera, and beholding the place to be both vast
and disconsolate, although she would willingly have returned into better
safety, yet was her weariness so great, rhat she was inforst to sit down
under the shadow of a fair Myrtle to repose herself for a little season: and
during the time that she was there sitting, she entreated the nymph Ethera,
either to sing unto her some pretty pastorals, of Shepherds loves (which well
she knew she could perform) or discourse unto her some pleasant history,
which beguiling Fancy might shorten the time, and make their abode less
tedious. Ethera as willing to obey as she was worthy to command, told her she
had a discourse, which would she vouchsafe to cover within the heavenly
tabernacles of her ears, she should find if not delight, yet infinite wonder;
But (said she) if any thing in it should stir offense, I had rather ten
thousand times it should perish in my bosom; But Melidora as insuspitious, as
she was innocent, desired her to proceed in her discourse, assuring her nothing
should be taken in evil part, which was either fit for her bashful nature to
deliver, or for her chaste care to entertain. This free charter given to the
fair Ethera, she began in this manner to speak unto her.

Of all the external glories (Madam) wherewith we cloth the outward
perfection of all excellent things; there is none of so sovereign authority
or controllesse superintendencie, as that which we call beauty, because there
is nothing wherewith the taste of the eye is at any time delighted, to which
we can give a greater Epithiton, then to say it is most beautiful. And so
(Madam) of the mind in like fashion, whose excellent knowledges, and divine
meditatio^s are but only the inward souls beauties; adding to the perfect
creature but this last of praise, that there is a beautiful mind in a
beautiful body; yet this beauty if it stir not in the most Judicial
beholders the height of admiration is said to be no beauty, for they be vulgar
things with which we communicate: they be heavenly or supernatural, which we
admyre; neither does beauty by the height of admiration gain the top of her
advancement: there is a certain inflamed Desire, which must crown and
royallize this Admyre with an incomprehensible love, or otherwise there is
neither Beauty, neither any Admiration. So that for us women, if the greatest
benefit we can beg of Nature be Beauty, if Beauties be Admire, if Admires
be love, and love be the worthy end to which we only were created; why do we
so rebelliously spurn at our happiness, and like to ambitious usurpers, kick
the Diadem with our feet, whose glory being engraven in our hearts, would
make us swim bloody seas to attain the possession. This speak I to you (the
crown and glory of all Maidens) to whom Nature has been so prodigal of
beauty that I fear for your sake she will prove penurious to all after ages,
in-so-much that slouenly Art taking upon him Natures prerogative, will like a
lavish tell-tale discover the defects of women's desires, and beauties: O this I
say again, I speak unto you, who being most beautiful are most admired, and
most of all creatures in the world enthroned, and crowned with an immovable,
and constant affection. O Madam, did you but feel the least of those bitter
pains, which the most enduring and forlorn Shepherd Thirsis, for your sake
only endures, or did you but know the violence of those immortal flames,
which darted from your eyes, like lightning kill ere they be perceived; I know
it were impossible for your tender heart not to relent at his passions; let me
beseech you then (most divine creature) if you be but as sensible of pains, as
you are beautiful to occasion torments; if in that excellent and sacred frame
of your body, there was ever felt the touch of all saving pity, to cast one
relenting look upon the utter dispairing estate of thy most lamentable
Shepherd, whereby thy mercy shall be made most mighty, thy sports and
pleasures anew revived, and thy delightful Tempe which droops (through his
melancholy) spring a fresh, and bring forth sweet Poesies, worthy only of the
Muses.

Ethera had scarcely made an end of these words, when Melidora starting upon
her feet, as if she had beheld either the dreadfulnesse of some monster, or
felt the bitter savor of Rue, or Wormwood, Disdain and Anger spreading
colors of defiance in the fair Roses of her lilly cheeks, sowring her
countenance with a most lovely sadness, she told the Nymph Ethera, that she
had attainted her ears with most blasphemous speeches, the sound whereof, since
she could not take from her memory, yet would she henceforth forever banish
herself the company of so unchaste a reporter. What (said she) has Thirsis
see'd thee to be immodest, or have thou seen in mine outward gestures that
appearance of folly, which might encourage thee to these monstrous persuasions?
Diana forbid. O heavens let me not live when my life shall presage I will fall
from virtue: and as for Thirsis, where before I did but only hate his love,
now I hate him, thy self, and both your memories: and with that offering to
depart away, before Ethera could either make excuse for him, or Apology for
herself, there suddenly rusht out of the woods a monstrous man, or a man mor
hideous then any monster; his name was Demagoras, a man whose stature did so
far exceed the greatest proportion of men then living, that more then
doubling their features, he was held for an invincible Giant: his strength was
greater then his limbs, and his mind fortified by his strength, made him so
infinitely bold, that he durst to adventure any danger how desperate soever;
his pride had no bound, yet would his cruelty have boasted of more larger
limits. What shall I say, such alone he was, as (to say truth) was utterly
all evil. This Damagoras has lived about the walks and borders of Tempe more
then this three years, making his revenues by the spoil, robbery, and
pillage of the poor Shepherds, and lurking in sundry vaste Caves, which for
that purpose he holds, does howerly and daily annoy, and waste, not only
Tempe, but al Thessalia, all-be the country has at diverse times set out
whole armies to hunt him, but all in vain, so great has been his craft and
policy.

This Demagoras whose very presence was able to have appaal'd the stoutest
resolution, had now stricken such deadly fear into the mind of the noble
Princess; that like an innocent Dove, over whom the covering Falcon threatens
more then an ordinary destruction, she stood so pitifully amazed, that
fear having taken from her mind the remembrance of all advantage, or
safety, she had no power to stir: whilst the rude slave, like a greedy
Cormorant seized upon her lilly hand, whose very touch might well have
told him how much too precious it was for so vilde and so inciuill an
imbracement. After he had caught her thus within the compass of his power,
shaking his grizely vncurled locks, which seemed never to have been
acquainted with any manner of comeliness, he tryumphed of his conquest, as
much as if he had given an overthrow to the whole world: and indeed the world
could be no more lamentably deformed, then to have thus the only Jewel thereof,
(the admirable Melidora) in so woeful an estate of sudden destruction: for
after the inhumane wretch had Lion-like ceaz'd her within his paws, all-be his
only desire to do ill was attractiue enough to draw him to the uttermost of
illness; yet beholding the excellency of her heavenly countenance, whose
chaste beams were to the virtuous: schools to instruct modesty, and correct
viciousness: now to him were firebrands of lust, and unnatural motives to
most bloody tyranny, which only out of their own excellencies, could but work
this alteration, that he whose Fury was ever his orator, and Will his law; was
now at first content to entreat, what of all things was most impossible to be
granted, I mean the divine treasure of her love, and the fruition thereof,
which the savage monster told her had taken such fast root in his degenerate
soul, that it was not possible for him to live and endure either delay or
denial. To which the Princess made him answer, that how ever the eye is said
to entertain affections in moments; yet for her own part, her eye was so true a
tenant to her heart, that it durst not give harbor to any object, which of her
heart was not first esteemed most worthy; wherefore she humbly besought him,
that for that time she might return in safety, and if hereafter her eye would
satisfy her heart, it was likely she would not conceal her longings: the
villain with this answer grew so enraged, that rudely shaking her by the
tender arm, like a Northern blast tearing a slender Tamoriske, he said:
Disdainful Maid, thou that art the horror of Tempe, and the wonder of so many
amorous Shepherds, think thou that either my love shall endure control, or
my desire to be excellently impious, loose me this opportunity to be notably
infamous? it cannot damzel, it cannot, I have vowed the spoil of thy good
name, and the destruction of thine honor, from which neither Jones thunder, nor
Apollos darts that slew the Serpent Python, is able to bring thee any ransom:
and the more willing I am to be thy persecuter, by how much I shall gain that
celestial Jewel, which through the world is blazed of the greatest valuation.
And here the Monster began to fold his arms about her Iuorie body, from
which she nimbly delivering herself, fell down upon her knees like a devout
Saint, praying to a damnable Idol, and humbly besought him to take away her
life, rather then to attaint her honor; in which merciful proceeding he
should bind her spotless soul to do him service in a better kingdom; O
excellent man (said she) let me not survive my happiness; make me not wretched
by a weary life; but since the uttermost of revenge is but death, let my death
at thy hands make for all my disdaines, a deserved (though bloody) satisfaction.

These words which might have moved in any marble breast, some commiseration,
like oil into fire did make more mad the flame of his raging, so that he
solemnly once more swear the performance of his detestable desire; at which
sentence she shryking out, and with weak force arming an invincible heart,
began to strugle and contend for the saving of that pretiousnesse, which lost
is too precious ever to be recovered; to her struggling she added such
lamentable outcries, such piercing sorrows, and such deafening clamors, that
even Heaven and earth were grieved with her infinite tormentings, and as they
are commonly seen in such cases, they did add unto her vigor (though not such
force as to free her from captivity) yet so much blessed fortitude that she yet
preserved both her honor, and all the Iuel sights or imaginations belonging to
her sacred body, free from the sullying of so barbarous a Traitor.

Whilst the Princess and the Monster were in this deadly strife thus
impatiently contending, poor Ethera whose fearful soul boaded her no better
fortune, like one distraught or lunaticke, taking this advantage, ran into
the Woods, and with infinite clamors cried for help to the Gods, to men, to
beasts, to any thing, to all things; crying with such loud pitteousnesse,
that every Echo there abouts in pity of her ruth did double and redouble her
noise and lamentations, insomuch that Thirsis w, ho that day more to avoid
company, then to companion any delight, being walked fourth into this vast
solitary place, as fittest receptakle for disdayned sorrows, happened to cross
Ethera; and demanding what might occasion in her this hyddeous skritching?
she even distraught with woefulness could answer him nothing, but help,
help, rape, murder, force, Melidora, Melidora: she had no sooner named
Melidora, and with such precedent words as did signify either her death, or
danger, his hair began to start up, his heart swelled, his eyes sent forth
fire, and his tongue cried out; dear Nimphe, where, when, how, which way, what
place, what slave? O satisfy my longing, but she running from him, and he
pursuing her to be better instructed, she at last brought him where he
beheld as much, and more the^ she had told, or he imagined; for eue^ now the
Princess being fore-wearyed with striving, and fore-done with the tyrranous
rage of her enemy, not being able longer to resist, she fell into a swound, but
the villain having tied her by the golden hayres of her head fast to a
Cypress tree, held her from falling to the earth, so that she hung like an
unmatchable picture, wherein sorrow and despair was most lively presented;
and had not the loue-thrald Shepherd come in that auspitious hour, the
Villain might have atttayned the worst of his foulest wishes; But it was not
an amazement, it was not a furye, neither was it a madness which then took
houlde upon Thirsis, but even a celestial valor, in which all the glistering
Tapers of honor might be disecrned, which bearing him upon the immortal
wings of Resolution, made him with so glorious a courage, assault the inhumae
Demagoras, that having only but his sheep-hooke which he towered above his
head, he threatened more then all the Lances which guard the Palaces of
Princes. Now when Demagoras saw the Shepherd coming to assail him, he left
the Princess, and taking up a massy club of Steel, which ever be boar about
with him, he met the shepherd, thinking with one blow both to punish his pride
for daring; and to finish the combat which he scorned to account a contention.
But the Shepherd as nimble in his deliver action, as he was valient and
powerful in destributing blows, at the first encounter with a slip avoided the
downfall of Demagoras stroke; and in the same instant making good again his
former ground, gave Demagoras such a blow upon the shoulder, that it made his
arm sloathful in aduauncing his club to revenge the pain he suffered; But
wrath and disdain, or a disainfull wrath, that he should meet with an
incounterour, madding his soul, caused him strike at the Shepherd with such
furye, that had it light upon, either his head or body, it had utterly
confounded all the rest of his members, but as the former, so he did, avoided
the second, retourning back such heavy interest, that Demagoras was sometimes
ready to sincke under the burden. Thus betwixt them began a fearful and
dreadful combatte, the noise of their fierce blows awaking the Princess from
her swound, whose eyes being opened to see the amorus shepherd thus ingadged
for her sake, began to ouerflow their banks with new tears, not tears of
grief for her bondage, but that her delivery should be more yrksome then the
basest servitude. The valie^t shepherds rare valor, his Prince-like carriage,
and his infinite danger, wrought but this in her mind, that so her honor
might be unstained, she rather wished death then this likely deliverance, as
hating that life, which to him she could not affect, must of necessity be
ingadged. Whilst thus with these thoughts she was variously carried, wishing
health to the Shepherd, whose health she only confounded; the fight more and
more augmented, and Thirsis had with his hook drawn much blood from
Demagoras, which to revenge, Demogaras bringing all his forces into his arms,
he stroke at Thirsis such a counterblowe, that a little glauncing upon his
head, put him into a little stamering amaze: which perceived by Demagoras and
much doubting by former proof the requital of such payment; taking advantage
of that stroke, turned his back and ran with all his power into the thickest
woods where cursing and banning both the heavens and his fortunes, he hid
himself from the view of all creatures. After Thirsis had in his pursuit both
lost the sight of his enemy, and the hope of his revenge, he returned back to
the Princess, whom when he found in that manner bound like an innocent
sacrifice upon a profane Altar, he threw himself upon his knees before her
and said. Goddess of my life, pardon I beseech thee, my presumption in that
mine unworthy hands dare be so bold as to touch the seemly tresses of thy
goulden hair: alas it is thine own danger, and the cruel knots knit by the
most hatefullest hand that ever profaned holy relic, which compelling me to
loose them, must excuse mine arogance, And with that untying her fair hair,
and setting her at new liberty, with a greedy eye, that was never satisfied
with looking, he gazed so earnestly upon her, that in the end imagining her eye
did chide his eye, for his over curyous wonder, turning his face away, he thus
said unto himself.

O Gods whilst Disdain and Rigor drew black clouds of despair betwixt the
Princess and mine affection, how me thinks the Sun has dissolved them and
made my Star shine fair upon my misseyre: alas it may be it is done but to
this end, that when I shall draw near unto the heavenly fire of her beauty,
I may there consuming end my days with felicity; how ever even as the bird
that is entangled in the snare of the fouler, does at the last gasp take
delight to hear that sound which brought her to imprisonment, so do her
looks (which brought this bitter anguish to my heart) not only refresh my
senses in their dispairefull extremities, but comfort my soul when she is
ready to take her flight from my dying body. And whilst he was thus talking
in himself, the Princess (O that so fair should have so foul a fault found
in them) without thanks, without acknowledgement, or without leaue-taking,
departed from his presence, not so much fearing the danger she had so lately
escaped, as desirous to avoid his presence, whom since she could not affect,
she could not acknowledge any bond wherein she stood indebted; which when the
woeful Shepherd by his turning about perceived, although he inquired of the
Nymph Ethera (who then was as grateful as the Princess was cruel) whither
the Goddess of his fortunes was departed, he could not choose but let the
very thought of her unkindness strike him to the soul, with such
intolerable agonies, that although his sighs, his sobs, his tears, his
broken heart, and his groaning spirit, were testimonies sufficient of her too
much ingratitude, yet even striving with life, he made his tongue deliver these
dolours.

And is she gone said he? is there no courtesy, no speech, no favor, no
thanks? O you immortal Gods, and thou great Nature that of nothing have made
this universal habitation, how negligent have you been in the framing of her
most delicate composure, placing in her all the divine graces that can
outwardly imbellish and adorn the most excellentest substance that ever was
created; and leaving the sacred intellectual parts of her understanding soul
(where Pity, that is only proper to her sex should hold his continual
residence) utterly neglected, abandoned, and forsaken; but alas, alas, it is
not your omission but my misery; not her want of pity, but my poverty: in
desert I am unfortunate, alas I am most miserable, which since mine ouerburdned
heart can no longer undergo to ease it, and please her, thus finish my days.
And even as he was thus speaking, he ran his head with all the strength and
power of his body so furiously against that tree, from which Melidora was but
even a little before loosed; that all be the hand of some supernall power (who
no doubt in that hour reserved him for far greater happiness) did compel
the blow not to take that wished effect the woeful Shepherd desired, which
was utterly to have finished love and life in a moment, yet had it so great
efficacy, that it struck him backewarde stone dead to all imaginations.

Ethera beholding this bloody tragidie, being as full of pity as the
Shepherd was of despair, she ran unto him, and laying his head upon her
lap, after she had wiped his wound, and covered it with part of her silken
garments, with long chaffing and rubbing him, she at last brought him again
to life; which was no sooner revived, but accompanied with his servant Memory,
the Shepherd lifting up his heavy ties, and looking upon the busy Nymph, he
said: Alas Ethera, have I not pain enough, but that thou also wilt give new
life to my passions; thou art unkind, alas thou art unkind; and here plucking
out his knife, he offered a second assault upon his breast, which the Nymph
withstanding, she thus with a friendly chyding began to admonish him: Fie
Thirsis fie (said she) thou shall not thus unnaturally rob us of delight,
and thy self of honor; for shame let not one tempest make thee despair of
the Summers beauty: what foolish sayler will for one storm strike sail, and
trust no more to Sea-fortune? why man if every blast should bring thy sheep
to the fold, how should thou profit, or they prosper? But thou have endured
no tempest, no storm, no blast; it is only calm silence which has ever
been constred, a consent or acknowledgeme^t, which by thy mis-interpretation,
brings thee to this malignitie: I imagine her bashful Nature, which without
blushing could not deliver thee the desert of thy merit, by her dumb
departure, has left thee to suppose she thought as much or more then thine
own will would have desired; and as she was thus expostulating with the
wounded Shepherd, a grave Swain well stricken in years (whose name was
Opicus) having amongst the rest of the Forresters and Shepherds, met with the
Princess, and heard of her adventure past; leaving his fellows to attend her
to her Lodge, he came to the place where Thirsis lay, whom for the excellent
virtues he had ever beheld in him, he loved most intyrely, whom as soon as
Ethera beheld, she called him unto her, and showing him the pittifulnesse of
his estate, and the cause why his estate was so pitiful, she besought him to
join with her, either in counsel or comfort, since she was persuaded that if
his despair continued, his life could not be of indurance; Opicus as full of
wisdom as then Thirsis was of discomfort, after he had showed him the
ugliness of his sin, and the unnaturalness of a selfe-combate, proving all
pusylanimitie, stupiditie, and blockishnesse in such a monstrous conflict, in
as much as the mind forgoeth thereby Hope, which is the golden treasure of our
understanding, firm Trust, which is the assured rock of all mortal safety,
and divine Love, which binds together all our joys, all our desires, and all
our prospirities: Now for this other love (said Opycus) which has little or no
community with this heavenly love, I mean this love of beauty, O Gods that
ever men should be so sottish as to seek it through their souls perditions!
But I will not distaste thee Thirsis by chyding thy follyes, but rather confirm
thee to attain wisdom; I tell thee, in this eye-loue there is no
impossibility, but the continuance of our affections, nor no maine assurance
worthy any certain despair, but our own furies; for how ever the tide
run, it falls as it flows: and this deluge of thy sorrow, Time can make
to be a worker of thy best comfort, I tell thee, Time brings to pass mighty
things of infinite importance, even those unconquered Beauties, which makes a
conquest of all the worlds best hearts, forcing sense to wonder, and souls to
Idolatrize, shall in the end strike the gallant top-sayles of their glories, to
the great Majesty of uncontrolled Time, even that impetious Time who captives
more subjects with his swift wings, then Cupid with his sharp arrows; even he
that winnes us unto him, when he shows us his back, and flies from us. Lo,
even whilst I am in talking, I feel the power of his great authority,
whereby he abates the ouerflow of swelling youth, dulles the keen edge of
every sharp piercing eye, make hoarce the sweet sound of the silver voice,
and marres the inchaunting Rethorick which has so often been broken between
the fair Pearl and Rubies beauty; it spoils the wealth of art and the pomp
of wit; so that like as we see overthrown nobility, loosing their roabes of
honor, not to disclaim the cottage garmte^s; (in such sort, than even the
Princess Melidora, her self in token of the true homage she owes to
consuming Time) forsake and disclaim from al those eye charming graces, of
which with such curiosity she had boasted. Thirsis no sooner heard him name
Melydora but as if that name had been an alaru^ to awaken his too sleepy sense;
raising up himself and looking Opicus in the face, he said: I tell thee
Shepherd Melidora lives not within the reach of Fortune, neither can Time
(were his power redoubled) make her immortal flower shed one leaf from her
branches. I tell thee, she like the top of that fair Laurel, which growing
by the Altar of Apollo, houldes both the frost and fire in contempt and
derision. What Swanne shall sing that shall not sound forth her praises? What
Swain shall Pipe, and not make her name his music? nay I tell thee even Time
himself, when he has finished his brauest conquest, shall bring unto her the
honor of his triumph, and having no more to overcome, shall hang up unto her
beauty, his murdering, Sithe for a monument.

Opicus seeing him thus violently ca^^yed away with unreasonable reasoning, and
finding ^^at contention did but rather agrauate then mittigate, loathe that
melanchollye should incur the title of Furye, leaving all other exhortations,
said only unto him, that since his constancy was an impediment to all
persuasions; there was in his conceit no better means then by mild intreatye
to move some Mercy; Alas, alas (said Thirsis) entreaty is as booteles as my
Love is hopeles: do thou not know the famous Shepherd Mopsus, he that
understands the language of the Birds, the Virtue of stones, the nature of
herbs, and what ever else can be covered under the habit of secret wisdom?
He, O he I tell thee, has long since calculated my natiuitye, and has found
the opposition of my Stars to boade me nothing but misery, assuring me my love
shall ever be dejected and despised; this has he prophesied, and this must be
believed; to these words Opicus thus replied.

I tell thee Thirsis, Mopsus can command both words and fortunes, but they be
all as false and vain, as himself is foolish and unlearned: therefore I charge
thee, let not thy diligent care give credit to his idle Oracles, but opposing
his maxims, thou shall make thy self able to discern his falsehoods: for
proof whereof, note but attentively this tale I shall deliver.

At such time as the healthful toil of my Shepherds life, and the homely
grosenesse of my country cheer, began to grow yrksome and unpleasant to my
fantastical taste; there sprang in me an earnest desire to behold the City
government, and that tryumphant magnificence, which in Princes Courts makes men
Angels, and Kings Gods; But Mopsus seeking to withdraw my mind from those too
high knowledges, thus went about to persuade me,

Beware, beware (said he) vain man, to what end thou dyrectes thy journey: I
tell thee thou go unto a place where craft springes, colors flourish, and
devises swarm; where faces can alter their favors, tongues change their
speech, and Slymie bodies stick to the painted fortunes of raysde Potentates;
where guiltye men are made golden Idols, Flattery soothed by detraction,
oaths by periuries, and treason by friendship, Offices made subject to
crimes, and counsails to blood, ignorance attended by Pride, pride by Riot, and
Riot by civil and domestique Garboyles. O fly from this place from whence
Envy has expeld friendship, and Ambition banished the zeal of ancient
Pyetie, where slaves live with toil, Princes with fear, and even Kings
themselves with uncertain saftie: make not thy self a companion with
greatness, it is worse then Atlanta's Castle or Trophonius dungeo^, for even
in those Places dwell those alluring Sisters, whose inchaunting melody makes
strangers cleave to the Rocks: there shall thou apprehend mountains of gold,
yet shall thou but find only Glass; Each Turret in a Princes Palace has a
several tongue: each Wall a sound, and each vaulted roof a distinct
pronuntiation; neither do they echo like sound divided words, but repeat
whole sentences, yea many times more then was either spoake or imagined;
Beauty there like the Cockatrice persuades, ensnares, and then confounds; al
things are beyond capacities, poison in Golden Vessels, treason in close
hearts, and deep vndermynings in simple seeming understandings. Therefore if
thou will be gouernd by my knowledge, either lock up thy lips and thine
eyes, when thou shall behold greatness; or staying thy progress, live
securelye in thy country habitation; Lo Thirsis this was his counsel, and
these were the Aphorisms of his divinity: And did thou go (said Thirsis)
and did thou despise so grave an admonition? did I go (replied Opicus) yes,
I went and I shall never repent the worthynesse of so notable a journey; for
there I found craft had no ears, false faces had no love, and flatterers were
but the fools at Princes Tables. I saw Ambition headless, Riot comfortless,
and discention houselesse, I saw Treason tormented by loyalty, Policy
confounded by Religion, and periurye branded in the face with an iron of
infamy: In brief, I saw no evil but evil auoydable: yet there I saw many
fair Swa^s, whose songs me thought did equalize or out-goe either Ister, Poe,
or Douen: there I saw many fair Nymphs, whose vnpollisht perfections made
nature admyrable. There I saw many celestial Sirens, many lights, many
Goddesses, and many Graces, even there I heard those excellent soundes, whose
bewitching, and heart-pleasing tunes, made me stand distraught with delight
and amazement; what shall I say? I beheld more excellent obiectes then I could
immagine, yet not so many as I desired might live ever in my prospect. I saw a
people more civil then the Athenians, a Senate more wise then the Romans, and
a Nobility more glorious then all the ancient wotrhyes; but above all, I saw
a God or man, or at least a most Godly man, who with the shaking of his hand,
ruling the sway of many kingdoms; by his gate, his gesture and his almighty
Majesty, seemed better then Numa, stouter then Caesar, greater then Alexander;
his sword I saw was the guard of virtue, his Scepter the glory of peace, and
his Crown the Garland of prosperity: there was no Art but in his knowledge,
no knowledge but in his coceite, and no conceit but in his song only; his
presence me thought was brighter then day, and his countenance gave a glory
to the Firmament, O how my heart did dance in my bosom when I beheld his
presence! my soul drunk Nectar from his eyes, and even then me thought those
heavenly numbers began to flow in my brain, which making me despise the
rusticke melody of the homely Pastors, has made me ambitious, to sing of him
and of his glorious actions: nay, thou thy self know Thirsis, that all-be I
am returned back unto my Cottage, yet have I been desirous to raise mine
Oaten harmony higher then a Shepherds thought, or a Country construction;
and Trumpet-like to sound unto all the corners of the world, the great power
of his eternal name; but as thou see over strayning my self (as being
altogether unable to match the surmounting height of his greatness) I cracked
my voice, and have ever since become hoarse and unrespected: this I deliver
unto thee, that thou may understand as Mopsus has been deceived in his
former speculations, so he may err in his present judgments, and Melidoras
favor may falsify his Prophecy. Woe is me (said Thirsis) where shall I
begin to enter this Laborinth, or how shall I untie the Gordion that can find
no end to loose it? By gifts (said Opycus) for they be auayling Orators. Alas
(said Thirsis) there is no gift worthy her acceptance: Gold is but Oar, being
compared with her hair; Diamonds are but Glass, when her eyes do sparkle
upon them; can any Pearl be so otient as her teeth, or any Rubie so cherrie
as her lip? her neck is whiter then my flock, and softer then the down of
Turtles. Honey is made sweet by her words; Roses borrowe beauty from her
cheeks, and the goodliest Apples are made round by the two round balls that
are coucht in her bosom: to conclude, an eternal spring does flourish in her
looks, casting abroad into the world all the excellent perfumes of natural
sweetness, insomuch that this other day I saw a pretty Bed, which toyling
from bloome to bloome to gather her honey burden, light on Melidoras dimpled
chinne, with as great pride as if it had been a flower, worthy only the
Hesperian Orchard, and being there, sucked for honey with as busy labor, as
if she had been in the Hybean Gardens, or the Pestalian Rosaries: whilst
envy made me cry out of my fortune, that I was not so happy as that little
creature. And as he was thus speaking, he fell into a most extreme and
bitteer weeping; which to assuage, the Nymph Ethera earnestly besought him,
that since he could not abate woe, yet to endure woe with more patience; and
for the love of heaven, and for her love, whom as heaven (said she) thou
regardest, be this once directed by my counsel, which if it do not profit,
yet cannot bring thee to no greater peril then that wherein thou already
stand: and this it is.

There is belonging unto Fans Chapel, a Priest that is holy, wise,
discreet, and sober; one that has skill in charms, and knowledge in spells,
that has the spirit of truth, and the gift of prophecy; his abode thou
know, and of his integrity thou have heard; with him I will persuade so
effectually, that to morrow coming abroad, he shall vouchsafe thee
conference, where I doubt not, but either his counsel shall persuade, or his
cunning attain the uttermost end of thy best hopes, to what purpose (said
Thirsis) shall I trouble his knowledge, when my self knows her chaste heart
is sixth upon a more worthy object? She loves Diatassan, alas she loves him;
I know it, (answered Ethera) and I know Diatassan loves Apheleia, but let that
rest in their bosoms, be thou only governed by my rule, and my life shall
sooner end then I will end to labor thy contentment. Thirsis unwilling to
offend her, whose all carfulness was wholly to please him, with submissiue
obedience, yielded to all her entreaties, vowing to commit no outrage upon
himself, till he had tried the success of her counsels, and so rising from
the ground, and being conducted by Opycus, he returned home to his Cabin.

Ethera as soon as she was departed from Thirsis, all-be she had a busy mind
in a weary body, yet would she not leave searching up and down, from hill to
dale, from groan to wood, by the Arbors, by the Springs; by the Meadows, by
the Rivers, and al to find out the amorous Sheppheard Diatassan. At last in an
obscure thicket she spyde where he lay, and with him another Pastor named
Cosmo, of whom as soon as her eye had taken a perfect knowledge, with silent
pace and soft steps, such as could not betray her walking, she approached so
near them, that shadowing her-selfe under the covert of a slender Poplar, she
might well hear and understand all their speeches, which at first proceeding
from Diatassan, were full of passionate complaints, and doubtful longings,
till Cosmos (who as cares comforter) lay to control his sorrow, desired him
to show what sudden storm it was that had so soon darkened the bright day
of his happiness? to which Diatassan with a heavy sigh answered, that he had
of late beheld in these woods a Nymph so like unto a dead Lady, whom in his
first youth he had infinitely adored, that even as her living Image was lively
in her perfections, so every wound in him, which was closed by her death,
opens as often as he beholdes her, and bleedes as freshly as if it had been
she, and no other by whom his heart had been wounded. Of what name is she
(said Cosmo) or when came she in-into these walks that you have but seen her
so lately? Has she not used our Temples? has she not frequented our
May-sports? or has she not been present at any of our Pastorals? Her name
(replied Diatassan) is Apheleia, but for her artynall in these woods, or
frequent with our delights, it has been but latelye (my Cosmo) yet soon
enough I fear, and too soon to work my overthrow: Have you had any
conference with her said Cosmo? once (answered Diatassan) and then I found in
her a Maiesticall love, full of chaste severity, yet covered with the humble
veil of life-pleasing Pity; I found in her a jealous honor, yet a
bountiful courtesy; she displayed no signs of Hope, yet beheld I nothing to
make me despair: to be brief, in the midst of this indifferency, she gave
me this doubtful favor, behold it my Cosmo; And with that he showed him the
fair Ring, which she had formerly bestowed upon him, on whose curious devise
and workmanship, as they were with laboring minds inwardlye beholding: see,
see (said Diatassan) this Motto, this Manens moueor, my Cosmo, is it that
only torments and distempereth me; one while my thoughts gives my heart
intelligence that it should approve her to be constant, steddie and
immovable, howsoever she turn or wind about my wretched fortune; even like
the glorious frame of heaven, which with his countercourse ever returns to
the first point of his beginning; This thought is no sooner finished in my
conceit, but a new springes up, and then Imagination tells me, that she only
to my sight stands fixte and unmoved, yet like the celestial bodies moves
with such sortecie, that we shall sooner feel the change then behold the
motion: these and a thousand such cogitations, are the continual hammers,
which beating upon the Anuile of my heart, disquiet my senses, and take all
rest from my slumbers: which to reconcile or remove, I would become a slave,
either to Time or Opinion.

Etherae at these words, perceiving the Qu. was given her, which must let
loose her language, starting from the place of her aboade, presented herself
even to the sight and presence of the two Shepherds; and first under the
cloak of careful amine, and obsequious love, covering the vnexpectance of her
aproach, and the danger of her sudden intrusion; she briefly told
Diatassan with some flattering circumstances, how much she honored his
virtue, respected his quiet, and desired the satisfaction of his best longings;
therefore (said she) fair Shepherd, although thou did not see me, yet
have I heard thy sorrows, and long since suspected thy heavy plight; which to
help, I am now content thou shall esteem me rude: wherefore if it please
thee to accept of my counsel, I will direct thee into so fair a path, as
shall without amazement or danger, bring thee to the full end of thy wishes.

Diatassan, who had he had his counsels in his bosom, might have proved
more dainty in discharging them; now seeing they were revealed, like an infant
curtezan, who trembling at the first touch of sin, grows by use impudent in
sin; being altogether insuspitious, kissing Ethera's fair hand, told her,
that if either her knowledge could discharge his doubtfulnesse, or her
counsel dyrect him through the blind paths of his intrycate Love, that she
should not only make him an ever admyrer of her virtues; but a man proud to
be intytuled her Servant. Ethera as proud of this insinuation, as counning to
preserve her advantage, thus said to Diatassan; There is (quoth she) fair
Shepherd, not far from this place, and hard adjoining to the foot of the
Mountain Ossa, an obscure and ancient groaue of Pynes, of Cedars, and of
wild Olives, where no Shepherd haunts, no Beast feeds, nor any Satyr dare
profane. Within this dark groaue there is a little Grot, which making his
passage through the hollownesse of the earth, is all ouer-growne with bryre,
with thorn, with twitch, and with many inta^gling bushes. It is a place
unsearched, unknown, and undesired, as being rough, thick, and like hell,
dark and void of all comfort. Within this place there lives a holy Hermitte,
who being precious and dear unto our great God Pan, having sundry ways to
issue from this his desolate Mansion, sometimes to drink the comfortable air:
sometimes to give releife to distressed Shepherds, and sometimes for other
more holy recreations, I have often observed his hours: wherefore to morrow
about the evening, at what time it shall be my hap to meet with him, I will
with such sweet persuasion intyce his old years, that he shall not deny me
to stay, and for some little space to confer with thee, touching the
doubtfulnesse of thine affection, the gift of prophecy, the knowledge of
things past, and to come: and what else unrevealed art has been to mankind
hid, and obscured, the bountiful heavens to him only have disclosed;
therefore look thou discharge thy counsels into his ears, and with care
perform all his instructions, to shall thou raise honor unto him, ease unto
thy self, and to me thy well wisher a just satisfaction.

Diatassan after a little amazement at her discourse, calling up his better
wits, and finding a strong hope in this secret knowledge (being as it were
tickled with a desire to behold the issue, for love has no mean or patience
in his desires) demanded if he should not presently go with her? But she
answered No, for first she would confer with the Hermit herself, and then
she advised him at the clossing of the evening, to come unto the foot of the
mountain Ossa, and if there he found an Hermit, according to such description
as she gave him, then to proceed and try the event of his understanding:
Diatassan as much satisfied in himself, by this hope, as Ethera was hopeful
to satisfy others by this stratagem, after many obseruant kisses offered upon
the fair Altar of her hand, and double so many religious vows, and
protestations of several services, for this her no less kind then honorable
friendship, taking his leave of the polilicke Nimphe, did together with the
honest Shepherd Cosino, for that time depart home toward their own Cabinets.

But Ethera not having as yet brought forth that prodegie which she intended
should amaze all the world, and Tempe: but being as it were in a painful
labor of much greater subtilties; as soon as the Shepherd was gone from her
presence, she went and collected together sundry simples or strange
workinges, as Mandragge, Rue, Poppy, womansmilke, Roseleaues, powder of
Nutmegges, and such like; Of these she composed a strong liquid potion, which
being infused into a Crystal. Vyoll, and so carried it about with her in her
bosom. This done, she presently went to the lodge, where the Princess
Melidora lay, but missing her there, and being so imboldned with rage of her
own desires, that she feared not to be accounted barbarous, she went
straight unto that private Arbor, to which none might have access save only
the princess; and as Boldness was ready to make her set her foot within the
same, Wonder held her back, for she might hear a more then Angels voice,
which consorting the sound of a most delicate touched Lute, delivered unto her
ears this Sonnet.

Care keep that absent presence in my breast,
Whose present absence does torment my heart,
And I will make thee Mistress of my rest.
Not my souls good, but my souls better part.
That absent image houldes my present life,
My life in it; it in my life does live,
Part them, and all my senses are at strife,
They do my pleasures make, and comforts give.
Then gentle Care let no Carracter grave,
Other then his remembrance in my mind:
And eyes if you send to my hearts close cane,
Other then him, be you for ever blind.
He has my heart within his Image wrought,
I have his Image graven in my thought.
The very rareness of the sound delivered with such incomparable sweetness,
easily assured her whom the singer was, and that it could not be any other then
the Princess Melidora, wherefore retiring her self from her first intended
entrance, and being of a pregnant wit, apt to compass choice Numbers without
meditation, leaning herself against the backe-side of the Arbor, so that the
Princess might not loose one syllable of her utterance, she sung this song
Extempore, as it had been in the person of Diatasson.

Alas why should I hope for ease,
Of this my souls immortal strife,
Twere better to abridge my days,
Then urge her more to save my life.
O Apheleia thy loves power,
Is my lives date, and my deaths hour.
How cross has heaven been to my fate,
Since first I got the use of breath?
She that me loves, alas I hate,
She that I love desires my death,
O Apheleia thy loves power,
Is my lives date, and my deaths hour.
Cruel Love why did thou strike me,
With a Dart so full of woe?
If both my ever do dislike thee,
Nor my life thou will let go,
O Apheleia thy loves power
Is my lives date, and my deaths hour.
What boots it thee to see me bear
This raging fire in which I burn,
But that to men it may appear,
What fortunes thou can ouerturne.
O Apheleia thy loves power,
Is my lives date and my deaths hour.
Yet if thou ru'st on any smart,
Rue on my woe that woeful is,
But thou have an obdurate heart,
And stony minds wants Pitties bliss.
O Apheleia thy loves power,
Is my lives date, and my deaths hour.
Alas why should thy chaste fair sight,
His glory gain by killing me,
And so against all law and right,
Win an abusiue victory?
O Apheliea thy loves power,
Is my lives date, and my deaths hour.
Why did thou give life to my flame,
If hope to kill were thy regard,
What worser chance can crown thy name,
Then still to love and lack reward?
O Apheleia thy loves power,
Is my lives date, and my deaths hour.
And shall the showers of tears I show,
Gain no remorse for all my smart?
Alas stern Love does answer No:
For why? he dare not touch her heart.
O Apheleia thy loves power,
Is my lives date, and my deaths hour.
It is in vain, I am ashamed
That thus I seek cure for my grief,
For hearts that are inhumane framed,
Love woe so well they hate relief.
O Apheleia thy loves power,
Is Diatassans dying hours.
The Princess attentively hearing this song, but not seeing the singer, after
her ears had drunk the sound of her Shepherds name, coupled with another
(as she thought) much unworthy of so hie pre-eminence, as if all such
adoration, had been most damnable blasphemies, all-bee the sound did not
challenge any thing from his voice; yet restless Jealousy struck such strange
fire into her bosom, that not able to contain her self, she came forth of
the Arbor with a more then usual haste, Anger making the Lillies of her face
cover all the Roses, But when she saw the deceyte, and that it was but only
the Nymph Ethera; new Gilliflowers springing about the Throne of Roses,
smiling upon the Nymph, she said:

I am glad (my Ethera) that thy pleasant free thoughts, stirring up thy silver
voice, will give us the comfort of thy song: believe me, I feared, thy last
affright would have robbed both from thee and me, all taste of solitary
pleasure; But I pray thee fair Nymph, tell me what song was this, which thou
did even now so passionately utter, was it of thine own, or of others
composing? The Nymph Ethera with a downe-cast look, and an humble reverence,
teaching her cheeks so artificial a blush, as might very well deceive
Nature, bowing herself before the Princess, and first craving pardon for her
bold presumption, in that she had come so near the place of her private
retiring; assuring her with many pretty protestations, that she was utterly
ignorant of her there aboade: in the end she told the Princess that for the
song which she had sung, it was none of her own invention, but made by the
famous Shepherd Diatassan, in honor of the love he bare to the fair Nymph
Apheleia, which she of late hearing, had now newly bequeathed to memory.

O God! had the Nymph Ethera out of an implacable anger taken a vow utterly to
have confounded the Princess, or had the Princess been the utter confusion
of all the generation from whence the Nymph was descended: had the Princess
been her rival in affection; the bar to her desires; or had the Princess
said, (what no woman can endure to have said) that she had not been fair,
she could neither have found a more ready poison, nor a more sharp
revenge, then the utterance of these words, which she delivered: they were
Daggers in the Princess heart, they were wounds in her soul, and living
deaths of dying lives anguish: what passion was there, with which she did not
communicate? what fear, what distrust, what jealousy, what madness, what
amazement, and what else that may take upon it the name of absolute evil, But
in the end Reason that could never endure that such evils as these should
become masters of his fairest habitation, but like Carniuall masquers to have
only a moments entertainment, and no further, summoning his best accomplices
as Virtue, Constancy, Consideration, and such like, began to war against
the former, with these arguments.

First she called to mind the virtue of his former life, his innocent
thoughts, his plain dealing tongue, and his vndisembling actions; the
severity of his government, giving no liberty to inconstancy, and his
honorable imitations, being even assurances of the best goodness, insomuch
that Passion being accompanied with his only companion easy belief, and both
they attended on by Anger their servant, casting a threatening cloud over the
cheerful Firmament of her divine looks, she thus spoke to the Nymph Ethera.

Well I perceive than the use of sin brings the Evil both to a delight and
easiness in sin, nothing in them augmenting their ripeness more, then the
warmth of their own wickedness: of this has thine immodestie given me a
double experience: thy first unchaste persuasions, being now seconded with a
most shameful slander, lightness and impudency, striving how to create
murder. O Ethera thou art doubly unkind, unkind to virtue, the shadow of
whose countenance has brought thee to much honor: but most unkind to truth
whom thou seek to kill with a false witness; be thy folly therefore thy
scourge, and both my hate and refusals of thy counsels, profes of that
detestation wherein I hold thee: henceforth I charge thee neither to frequent
these walks, nor acknowledge my memory, but living an eternal exile,
complain to the world what woes falshoode and shame have brought upon thee.
Alas poor Diatassan, the virtue has begot thee infinite envy, and thine
imaginary happiness seeks to enrich thee with most cottaine mischief, but
thy goodness has taken such well grounded root in mine understanding, that
nothing shall draw from thee the bliss of my good opinion: live but as happy
as thou art constant, and even Angels shall find want in thine unbounded
prospetiue. And as she spoke these words, tears rising in her eyes, as it were
to make a question in the world which were the more purer Diamonds, she
offered to depart. But the Nymph after the custom of disgrast Tragedians,
whose first act is entertained with a snakie salutation, falling upon her knees
and staying her by her garments, with all the humility that either Art, of
Nature could exercise, humbly besought her to stay, and hear what she had to
say for her justification, assuring her by protestations of unspeakable
earnestness, that when she had drawn her words before the throne of her own
consideration, she should find them so full of substantial credulity, that no
maxim whatsoever, should either be more true, or more certain. At this the
Princess with a little amazement began to stay, whilst the Nymph Ethera thus
spoke.

How hard and v^^ossible it is (Madame) for any persuasion to alter or vnground
that settled belief which in our souls we have planted as a matter immovable,
the infinite errors which at this day reign in the world are living presidents:
the mind creating reasons to defend her opinion; and the conscience being so
free a spirit, as will neither endure bondage nor controlment: as of this
(Madam) so we may speak of Love, whose supreamest power having dominion over
our belief, makes all things impossible which is not within the compass of
our affection; from whence has sprung those prodegies of Nature, of which even
the world at this hour swells big withal; men madder then Pigmalion, not
affecting well carved Images, but doting upon most deformed, loathsome, and
infecting Sepulchers; women worse then Pasiphae, not lusting after beasts, but
monsters; Mize^tius cruelty being exercised in every Cathedral: so infinite
is Loves belief, and so impossible to be controlled: which belief since in your
most excellent self it has found a well furnished habitation, my reasons
unable to contend with your wisdom. and the credit of my words being
disgrast in your opinion, it shall be sand sprinkled in the wind for me to go
about to exchange your conceit by any persuasion, yet inasmuch as my clear
soul loatheth a spotted garment, let me even by your virtues sake, and your
beauties sake, conjure you to give my report this approbation: your Majesty
knows Eugenio, the holy Prophet to our great God Pan, he that knows what
was, what is, and what shall be; he that can bind charms, unloose doubts, and
even almost alter destiny, to him (dear Madam) let us privately repair, and if
what I have reported, he do not second with mo^^ substantial proofs, let his
truth be my conviction, and your hate my punishment. At these words, if not
Jealousy, yet a fancy in all proportion so like Jealousy, that it could be
taken for no wrong to give him his title, began to arise in the Princess
thoughts stirring such a civil commotion betwixt Fear and her belief, that
even with the amazement of their distracted persuasions, she grew both
astonished and confounded, till desirous to know what she most desired not to
know, after many arguments to approve his virtue, and double so many reasons to
confirm her opinion, in the end she agreed to come with the Nymph Ethera to
this place, where by my judgment and fore-knowing science, the one might have
her doubts resolved, the other her truth confirmed: Time in this business was
held so precious, that neither of them would agree to the loss of one moment;
but as it were forgetting all business, which to this business was not
appertaining, without either greater guarde, or better preparation, they
forthwith, hither directed their iourny, where both the princess, and the
Nymph arrived at such time as the Sun declining down from the top of the
heavenly Mountains, making his cooler beams shine upon these walks with a
more sufferable warmenesse, had invited me forth to entertain the sweetness
of his Evening progress, and being set upon this bank of flowers, with a
modest gracefulness, such as Majesty only has power to make admirable, the
Princess gave me a divine salutation, wishing me increase of hours, peace of
thought, and the bliss of mine own wishes, to which when I had returned the
best and hartiest of my prayers, the Princess told me she had an earnest suit
unto me, which would I vouchsafe to grant, I should not only tie her in the
best bond of friendship, but make her acknowledge to posterity how much she
was a handmaid to my wisdom, I that ever have been a servant to the servants
of my God, besought her to proceed, assuring her that whatsoever was either
within the compass of my prayers, counsels or knowledge, should with my best
endeavors labor her satisfaction: and with that, even as she was opening her
lips to deliver her questions, the Nymph Ethera interrupted her by delivering
to me these speeches. Father (said she) as our desires are earnest, so are our
questions tedious, and both will extort from thy gravity, either a long
discourse or an imperfit satisfaction; which to make perfect, that neither
thine age may be grieved with our conference, nor we return with a half
parted solution, so please thee take this Vial filled with a strong and well
composed liquor, whose warm moisture I know will quicken the frost of old
age, and make the spirit of youth revive in thy bosom, and drink of it an
hearty draught, I know it will comfort your veins, and make the pain of
speech less yrksome to your weakness, and therewithal she drew forth the
vial of liquor she had formerly mixed, and gave it me to drink, of which I
took a full draught: the Nymph ever urging me to drink again, till I made
her this answer, that it did not befit the life I had undertaken, either to
make proud the flesh, or fill my empty veins with new heat of glowing
youthfulness, whose rebellious spirit holds an eternal mutiny with the
divine soul, but rather by the use of thin diet, much watching, and many
cares to humble that Typhon, my body, and make it serviceable to great Pan my
sovereign, and at these words, delivering her vial into her hand, I humbly
desired the Princess to proceed to her question, who immediately thus spoke.

I have heard (said she grave father) that the Siren does not inchaunt, but
instruct, not bewitch but enrich with wonder the attentive ear of the
Seafaring or weather-beaten trauailer, who delighted with the honey oratorie
of their Prophetique and divine language, stays his busy course, and with
amazed admiration, drinks the celestial wisdom of their incomparable
knowledge, no less then theirs; nay much more abundant is the report of thy
wit, reading, and excellent, experience, for whom our fields and we are
blessed, and in whom lives the hope and felicity of our lives comfort: O let us
then (I beseech thee) receive from thy learned and unspeakable wisdom, some
serious discourse of such things, as either to our memories are unknown, or in
the date of our after time, by the hand of Destiny, shall be fulfilled* and
believe it we will bind our ears as firmly to thy wisdom, as the
rocke-bound Mariner to the Music of the Mermaide.

I hearing this pretty suit made from so excellent a mouth: told her, that
all-be the liberal heavens had for their own glories, and man's satisfaction
created me a vessel for their use, enclosing in me some knowledge of their
more secret wisdom, yet that either my tongue should rashly break up the
seals of the eternal register of the uncontrolled Fates, or that my easy
charity should for mortal satisfaction disclose the counsels of the starrie
Parliament, were both an odious blemish to mine old age, and an utter
banishment of those graces, which by the grace of heaven had hitherto in me
abounded; neither are (quoth I) the hie contemplations of the divine powers
within then reach of man's knowledge, being a creature rather created to look
into the wretched estate of his own sinfulness, the remembrance whereof
should even bow our heads to our feet, and make us with trembling
admiration look upon those dangers which howerly lie before us, wherein we may
behold in daily models, how even the wisest do fetter and entangle themselves;
yet fair Princess, inasmuch as I know your wisdom is never unaccompanied
with Virtue, and that Virtue now inflamed with a desire of unrevealed
knowledges; to give some satisfaction both to your wisdom, virtue, and
desire, constantly behold this myrror or glass of divine providence. And with
that I drew forth this glass, which ever I bear in my bosom, in which as the
Princess gazed with a thirsty eye, and an inflamed remembrance, she might
behold the whole compass of the round world, both heaven, earth, sea, and
hell; and above all as in a Sphere of the most speedy motion, whose whirling
swiftness took from the eye the distinguishment of the matter, whereof it was
composed, she might behold set in her triumphat Throne, the great and
dreadful Goddess of Fortune incertaine Ramnusia, who beeng set upon three
round Munddes, whose motions were three times swifter then the Suns Chariot,
was at that time shaping all worldly premotion into the fashion of an
almighty Wheel, running continuallye about an Axeltree wrought out of a rock
of impenetrable Diamond about this Wheel she saw swarming all sorts of
people, even from the Throne of Majesty, to the stool of earth, which is much
lower then the Cottage, some hanging by the heads, some by the hands, and
some by the feet, some by the eyes, some by the ears, and some by
imagination: none having so certain hold as could give assurance to their
abiding, nor any one so incertainlye placed, as seemed to apprehende any
fear of sudden falling; yet never did leaves in Autumn fall thicker from
the parched trees, then these vassailes unto Fortune, dropped and shewred down
from this infinite engine, only one above all the rest that sat upon the top
of the Wheel in a Chair of glass, stayed and supported by many columbs and
pillars of Crystal, Iette, and Porpherie, showed that in the greatest
inconstancy and exchange of alteration, there is ever some one figure of
constant eternity; this glorious person seemed to be the only delight of
Fortune, as in whom she had planted her choysest affections, given her the
control of her Godhead, and even the alteration downfall, and vp-rising of her
frowns, favors and aduancements, this worthy creature the Princess might
see, with her hand lift up, Millions to the top of Fortunes Wheel, and seat
them with assurance round about her, she might see her raise Gammede to
heaven, and make him Jove's taster, for whose take even the whole generation of
Troy received an eternal blessing, she might see her take Appollo from
Admetus flocks, to make him Lord of the worlds beauty, and the Roman Maro
from rubbing Augustus horse, to sing the honors, virtues and conquests, of the
most celestial generations; what might she not see he do that was
impossible to be done by any other creature; she might see her favor work all
things, making vanity the school of wisdom, if she gave tolleration to one
vain opinion, and piety it self, more esteemed for her imitations, then for
its own goodness; but in the end, what with the multitudes of her own
aduauncing, and the slippetinesse of the throne wherein Incertaintie had plast
her, the Princess might behold that great minion unto Fat, and Favor fall
like a star from the heavens, unto the foot of the lowest destiny, the
whilst her own creatures, like ayme-crier; beheld her mischaunce with
nothing but lippe-pitie.

These and many such like visions the Princess beheld in my prospectiue,
which drawing her mind to reckon with many wonders, and intangling it in a
many-wayed Laborinth, she in the end besought me to explain the meaning of
these doubtful and obscure inigmas: But scarce were her entreaties past from
her lips, when a heavy and dead slumber ceazing upon all my senses, locked up
both my utterance and knowledges, so that falling into a most sound sleep, I
gave her assurance, that her doubts at that time were to remain unsatisfied;
but the Princess as greedy of understanding as my body was of rest, with
pretty motions, and the raising up of her well tuned voice, into a higher Key,
sought to awake and break off my sleeping, till the Nymph Ethera besought her
to remain satisfied, in as much as no sound had power to vncharme those
slumbers, declaring therewithal how she had to this end mixed that potion of
which the old man had drunk, against whose operation there was neither noise,
nor violence could prevail: which as soon as the Princess understood,
fearing that her fears would be too long lived, and doubting this stratagem,
was devised only to lend eternity to her doubts full of divine impatience,
clothed in the robes of the most lonelyest anger, she began bitterly to
inueigh against the Nymph, renewing all her former opinions touching her
falshoode, and fortifying them with this witness, that gave assured
testimony, she durst not abide the trial of any innocent or upright Justice:
after the Nymph had given the Princes leave even to tire her anger with her
own passion, she in the end interrupted her with these words.

See, see, madam (said she) how in the most excelent things, this fury which
we call conceyte, does tyrannize and confound all those celestial ornaments
which should make them most admyred: thinks your Majesty I invented this to
keep mine own sin hidden? no, it is to make my glory like the Sun, much
brighter; I know (Madam) the effects of our Feminine belief, and the
sovereignty of Love, both which admit no credit, no not to Angels, if their
Ambassages run in oppositions with our fancies, wherefore (Madam) that this
virtuous old man, shall not like the Troyan Prophetess, tell truth without
credit, nor I without cause bear the burden of calumniation; thus if it
please you I have devised: the grown and hoode which this reverent Priest to
our great God wears, you shall put on: his Book, his beads, his Glass, and
his Staff, you shall also exercise, and in all aprearance to the eye, bearing
the whole image of his gravity, you shall seat your self in this place, and
as not being what you are, but what you seem to be, I mean the aged
Eugenio, you shall this day to all such as shall make hither their repair for
counsel, unfold the hidden mysteries of their fortunes: amongst whom, if
the noble Shepherd Diatassan shall appear, and unto your own ears discharge
all and more then that little, all which I have delivered; be then your self
the indifferent Judge betwixt your belief, my wrong, and his inconstancy. The
Princess apprehending her devise, gave easy consent to the accomplishment,
and therewithal leading me into a private Arbor, where they might more
conveniently disroabe me, they began that intricate work, which how it was
effected, seconded, and controlled, who are desirous to understand, must
expect in the next volume.

FINIS.
