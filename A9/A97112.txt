A Word in season: TO ALL SORTS OF WELL minded people in this miserably
distracted and distempered Nation.

Plainly manifesting, and on their ready compliance with them.

Also That the destruction and bondage of the Commonwealth in general, and of
every good minded man in particular cannot be avoided* if the people, through
want of consideration, shall give care to any other counsels or counselors.

A word in season, TO ALL SORTS OF WELL MINDED PEOPLE IN this miserably
distracted and distempered Nation.
SINCE, (as the Scripture speaks) no man hates his own flesh, but loves
and cherishes it; and that naturally, every man seeks his own good: It is
very strange, seeing we have the help of Reason, of Ex^erience, of the Word of
God) that ^he right way, which leads to that End, should be so hard, and
difficult, to be found, certainly, it cannot be so in it self; God has been
more good to man, then to make things necessary hard to come by.

The difficulty will rather be found to a^ise by our own default, from our
want of a patient, settled, serious, and religious consideration of things,
whereby we are continually liable upon all occasions to be misled either by
our own evil and eager desires, o^ by the evil examples of others, or by evi^
(though long settled) customs; or by the persuasions of politic deceivers,
into such ways, which though they seem to be strewed with Roses and perfumes,
yet are the ways of death, and when we least suspect, bring us to destruction.

Our blessed Savior therefore bids us to b^ wise as Serpents, because whilst
we live in this world we have to do with Serpents, and to beware of Wolves
that come to us in sheeps clothing, to be innocent as Doves, is a most blessed
temper of spirit, but very unsafe and liable to every ginne, and bird of prey,
if the wisdom of the Serpent be not joined therewith: Now all the helps of
reason, of experience or the Word of God, produce not this wisdom without
consideration; advised deliberate consideration, (such as few in this Nation
are accustomed unto) without which that which is called knowledge or
understanding, is not true knowledge nor understanding, serving to no public
use at all, except to distract and distemper, and ve^^ and destroy a Nation. It
is the voice of God himself; My people will not consider, they will not
understand; without consideration it is ^mpossible to understand any thing as
we ought, and without understanding (true considerate understanding) man is
like unto the beasts that perish: nor had this Nation ever been thus miserable
as it has been, is, and is like to be, but for want of this kind of
consideration in the People; so that it may be as truly said of this, as of the
perverse, rash, inconsiderate Nation of the Jews; thy destruction is of thy
self, O England. And if ever there were a cause to study and put in practice
the wisdom of the Serpent, to bewa^e of Foxes that come to us in sheeps
clo^hing: if ever there were a time requiring the uttermost of wisdom and
consideration ^n all sorts of people, rich and poor, high and low, one with
another; now there is a cause, now is the time.

For never to this day, were those who are trusted with the care of the
Commonwealth, so beset and surrounded with difficulties; with unexpected
appearances of strange things, such as no age can parralell, of so high and
great concernment, as the least miscarriage therein, may in a moment of time
make void all their long, their faithful and painful endeavors, and involve
us all into the most miserable bondage that ever overwhelmed any people.

And therefore (however any sort of men may delude themselves) if we do not
al^ jointly and unanimously (laying aside al^ dis affection for differences in
judgment i^ Religion) patiently, setledly and seriously deliberate and
consider what every one of us ought to do, in reference to their preservation,
abandoning all passion and wilful prosecution of perverse and preposterou^
things, all jarring and repining at their proceedings; this Nation cannot be
safe or happy, nay, cannot but be miserable and wretched.

For the greatest and most superlative freedom, of this Nation (and wherein the
safty and welbeing thereof does reside) consists in this; That Laws cannot
be made Government ( Ecclesiastical or Civil) cannnot be established or
Altered: War cannot belevied, nor Peace concluded, nor monye^ raised, not any
thing done; but by the Authority of those whom the People themselves do choose
for Parliament: and entrust as their Commissioners, with full and complete
power for their good. Had it not been by this just Authority, We had never
been freed, from the tyrannies, oppressions and cruelties of the High
Commission, Star Chamber, and Councel-board: from the burthenous Execution of
Forrest-law, Court of Honor, Commissions of Waste: from the Extortions, and
Exorbitances, in the Courts of justice, Chancery, Requests: from Shipmoney
(for remission whereof, no less then twelve Subsidies were required) and from
all those other innumerable Patents, Projects, Illegal warrants, and
Imprisonments: Things which the whole Land long groned under; though (now
removed) the benefit be unworthily forgotten, or mis-attributed to an Act of
grace.

Had it not been for this Authority; the Court of Wards had never been
abolished, that for many Ages has oppressed the Land.

Had not this Authority opposed; the King had been furnished with monyes to
have warred upon our Brethen of Scot^and, in his first attempt upon that Nation.

This Authority, in the worst of all former Times, when the strongest force and
power was upon them* ever stuck closest to the intrest of the People, nor did
the People in the worst of times, ever forsake them, but maintained Their power
and privileges, their Essence and Authority, whenever they called upon them
for help and assistance, nor has this just and powerful Authority been more
true to the Commons that chose them, then to those worthy Lords and Patriots,
that at any time have assisted them for the common good of the Nation,
preserving their Honors with as true affection as the liberties of the People;
no man can name the time that (intentionally) this Authority ever did injury to
any Just intrest either at home or abroad, but have borne and suffered much,
from those that have made an ill use of their lenity and credulity.

All which is necessary to be remembered, and seriously considered in this
instant of time, beause if these things be seriously laid to heart, it may
happily expel those poisonous vapors, with which our air begins to be
infected, we have a generation of forgetful, ungrateful people, who because
the Parliament cannot yield unto all they desire (without extreme thraldom to
the people, in things Ecclesiastical and Civil) are degenerate into a
malevolent disposition, murmuring and repining at all their proceedings, and
making hard constructions of their Just endeavors; and by politic and subtle
means, labor to alinate the hearts of their friends from them, and to incline
them to give ear to other Counsels, laying open their infirmities, (which they
should rather go backward to cover) and would (if they could) possess the
world that there is a sort of men that would settle Religion more purely,
perform and interpret the Covenant more exactly, and do justice more
speedily, and more sincearely then this just Authority, whom the peoble
themselves have chosen, nay, there are fames abroad, that there are catalogues
taken of any thing that may possibly bear a bad or sinister construction, to be
showed to the people, in the day of their extremity, if such a day can be
procured.

And for what end all this? Why, you shall not fail to be told it is for the
glory of God, the setting up of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and the
everlasting good of the souls of the people, and the like; but take ye heed
how ye hear or give credit to these Siren songs? these charms of Dalilah,
are but to deprive Sampson of his strength, to rob the people of their Power:
It is a sad proverb, but Court Logic has proved it so frequently true, that
it may be related without suspicion of blasphemy, In nomine Domini incipit omne
malum; When the Divill transformes himself into an Angel of light, to make
his delusion current, he is necessitated to use such language: For which cause
our blessed Savior advises us to be Wise as Serpents, lest we be beguiled by
their subtle glosing dissimulations.

But as the Apostle says in another case, If an Angel from heaven preach any
other doctrine, let him be accursed. So in this case, if any though in the
shape of an Angel of light, of stength, of powers, or dominations, shall
endeavor, by any means whatsoever, to divide you from those you have chosen,
either in affection, or assistance, you are to hold them for the most accursed
Traitors that ever trod upon English ground, and to use all lawful means to
bring them to condign punishment; being well assured, that whatsoever is
pretended; the intent can be no other then to extirpate for ever the foundation
of the freedom and safty of the people: which once done, a ready way is made
for any thing that can make a people wretched and miserable, without hope of
remedy.

And therefore be advised in time, before you are engaged too far, and be
confident, those inconveniences you have fancyed to your selves (and wherein
you are like enough to be mistaken) if they should indeed prove real ones, yet
were you better to have patience, and by loving discourses and prudent means
endeavor to work a better information, (which time may produce, as by
experience in your selves you cannot but know) rather then through impatience
and violent importunity, to cast your selves upon a remedy that must
necessarily be destructive to the whole people of the Land: For once suppose or
admit that any (pretending whatsoever, piety or authority) may more properly
judge of Law (or religion so far as concerns the public) or give
interpretation of oaths or covenants, or treaties or transactions, or any thing
which is of public concernment, then those whom the people have chosen* and
farewell common freedom for ever, who ever those are you would so prefer, as
far as in you is, in so admitting or supposing, you betray the great freedom
of the Nation, and set Masters over the Parliament, then which there can be no
greater Treason.

Be not flattered and deluded out of your Birthright: Consider, what ever you
are, you are but apart of the whole people, it is impossible that you can give
the sense and mind of all the Commons of England: Nay, if you could, it is not
lawful for you to do it otherwise then by a becoming information, and to
rest satisfied when you have so done: You are not entrusted by the people, you
are not Chosen to that end: But this just Authority is a power chosen, and
entrusted; and you are to know, that they are absolutely Free to follow the
dictat of their own Understandings and Consciences, informed by the word of
God, by principles of right Reason, and all other good means, as is most
probable to conduce to the safety and weal of the People; which they lately
and worthily have declared to be the end of the Primitive Institution of all
Government.

Whosoever shall tell you, that either themselves or any others, will ever do
you more good then those you have chosen; make no scruple to own them for
deceivers, that Absolon like, kiss, and woo you, of purpose to enslave you.

What though some things may not be done so perfectly, or so inexcusably as you
could wish: Consider, they are but men, subject to the same passions and
infirmities as your selves; they are not like some ancient Fraudulent great
Councels, that have maintained the Canons and Decrees thereof to be infallible:
Nay, they are so far from such delusion, that they have many times altered
their own Orders, Ordinances, and Acts, upon further or better information,
and do not refuse, nor reject Petitions and informations duly offered by any
peaceable Persons, few, or many, and as readily follow the advices of others
(which they approve) as their own immediate apprehensions and Councels.

And as a sure testimony of their faithfulness and sincerity; do but
seriously consider, how exceedingly God has blessed them, viz. with the
affections of the people; with power and strength in the field, with
deliverance from many most desperate Plots, and out of many sore and difficult
exigents, that their enemies have bin as Chafe before their Armies: What force
has bin to mighty, or place to strong for their Achievement? And now, that
they have all, as it were in their own command (by the same good providence of
God) would you now because they cannot please you in every particular, except
they shall go against their own Consciences, gladly see them trodden upon and
brought under: Surely, if you would but open your eyes, you could not but see;
that the hand of God is still with them, and will not be shortened: He has
already brought low the Mighty, and reproved, vanquished even Kings for their
sakes, and for theirs whom they represent: And do You now Think that Any
shall be able to lay their honor in the dust? You cannot certainly be many,
that have been thus blinded or deluded: Nor can you possibly long continue in
so bad a mind. A little consideration must necessarily change your minds, and
God, I trust, will prevent you with his converting grace, and will not suffer
you to be tempted above your power. However, this is most visible to all
considerate men, that there are multitudes of honest Religious people, that
remain immaculate in their affections to this Honorable Parliament, and are
truly thankful for their unwearied labors, in recovery of the long lost
Liberties of this great Nation, and stand firmly resolved to maintain and
defend with their lives and estates, their just power and privileges against
all opposition, circumvention, or delusion whatsoever: And those who shall
cease to do this, through any conceived cause or provocation, they shall
esteem them the most treacherous upon earth, and not worthy the name of true
Englishmen, or Christians.

This, by general discourse and observavation, is found to be a known truth;
and therefore, it is earnestly hoped, the Honorable Parliament will no whit
abate of their resolutions, to make this Nation absolutely free and happy,
notwithstanding the manifold new discoveries of strange Apparitions, if they
but please to consider seriously the true Englishmans temper* they will find,
they have multitudes more with them then against them; and that in times to
come this shall be an English proverb, As certain to perish, as those that
openly oppose, or would secretly undermine a Parliament.

FINIS.
