Spread-Eagle at the West end of Paul's, near Ludgate M.DC.XLIX.

TO His Excellency Thomas Lord Fairfax, GENERAL Of the Parliaments Forces, AND
To the General Council of War.
You drive furiously over the necks of King and Parliament, Laws, Covenants,
Loyalty, Privilege, and no humane thing can stand before you: You are now
faced by the majesty and light of God, while you are asleep in a dark night
of earthly affairs: You have appeald to God in your second Declaration, but
did not expect so sudden an answer: It Is eternal and almighty truth that must
and will prevail; if you come into it, 'twill save you; if you turn from it,
you forsake your own mercy; if you oppose it, you dash your selves in pieces;
you cannot go from it, or besides it, but into the darkness of hell* The Lord
is here O^braiding your unbelief, but mourning over his Jerusalem* with love
to your persons, but with fierce anger against your practices: I would you had
those lively and fresh evidences of your personal and everlasting good in your
own breasts, as I have; your eternal state is sure; it is your present
wanderings that are here condemned; Blindness has happened to you in part; and
this is the time of casting you away; you will have a time of being received
again; you are now broken off through unbelief, you will be graffed in
again: It Is your fall now, you shall have a restoring; you will wonder to
behold so much goodness to your enemies, and so much severity to you Oh the
depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable
are his judgments, and his wares past finding out! I have reproved you
sharply, or cuttingly, its proper for you, With vengeance to save you, and to
pull you as firebrarnds out of the fire; your condition requires it;
Gentleness is abusd, mercy despisd, you have a long time trampled upon
kindness, and obstinately refused the word of the Lord: You must remember my
Sermon to you at Windsor upon that Text. Overturne, overturne, overturne; it is
Scripture still, and that word lives in and upon you. Salt-marsh his message
quickly followed it, Depart from the tents of these unrighteous men; he lives
still: And Mr Pinnels admonition from the Lord following that: These, and other
testimonies against you, have been slighted and disobeyed; your sins grow
greater, and the anger of God hotter against you; your reprieve is not your
salvation; you are grown to a height of confidence and presumption upon your
successes; your necks are as iron, and your brows brass; and you walk
uncontrollable in your way, triumphing as the only Princes in the earth, as
fit to sway the Scepter of England, and all nations; as the only righteous,
honorable people in the world; the great Lords of the Land* Therefore it
pleases me to power contempt upon you, to be shod with scorn and indignation,
and so trample upon Princes as mortar. Except I should deal thus with you, you
would not be sensible of what I say, being hardened against mercy; and having
done all you have done against love; Prosperity ^^ayes fools, and therefore
the rod is sit for their backs.

I know my dealing is just and righteous to such as you are, being (as Th^l.
3.18, 19.) Enemies to the Cross of Christ; seeming friends to his Gospel,
Ministry and Kingdom, but enemies to his cross: You hate to think that those
fair beginnings of your peace and deliverance, should come to end in shame and
death; you cannot think of leaving your hopes of outward glory, and lying down
quietly, to let the world trample upon you: This you count folly, Whose end is
destruction: Destruction you practice, it is your work, it is your end* you cant
not see beyond it, and you are hastening to it, it is the center to which you
tend; and therefore I cannot but show it you, that you may stop your course
before the pit shut her mouth upon you* Whose God is their belly; Your says,
understanding and God, is sunk into your bellies, and your rule, your
strength, your confidence is only in sensual and brutish things; your raisd
spirits into the things of God are buried in an inferior region of gross,
dull, carnal affairs, and except I should pierce deep, your slow bellies
would not find ears: Indeed you are so lost and drowned in sensible things of
the world, and so eager in seeking for those things your belly, your carnal
affections require of you, that I doubt you will be deaf to what I say. Whose
glory is in their shame; You are full of glory in your great things that you
have done; wonderful things, a mighty presence of God. But in sum, what is
it? You have torn a poor, sinful Kingdom in pieces; You have executed wrath
upon your Brethren, Friends and Countrymen; You have laid desolate your Father
the King, the Parliament your Mother, your own Country; this is your glory to
be executioners; Assyria, the rod of my anger: What a crown is this? Have you
restrored, blessed, healed, comforted, saved any? No, you have but plunged the
Kingdom and your selves into a pit of darkness and confusion: When the things
of God are proposd to you, to suffer for others, to love enemies, to do good
to all, to bless all; you glory in your shame, and say, you serve the Lord in
this, and there be lower as well as higher dispensations: You are indeed
servants of God, so was Nebuchadnezzar, so is the Devil; and you do the work of
God, but it is base drudgery, it is his strange work, to be instruments of his
vengeance; and it is a lower dispensation indeed, to dispense curses, not
blessings, to be below in hell, exercisd in the wrath of God, not above in
heaven in the glory and love of God; and for sons, heirs, so you would be
thought, to take pleasure in such mean employment, is vile and unworthy: Who
mind earthly things; this is another property of yours, your minds are now
captived to the earth, deep in the lower parts of the earth, in the belly and
foundations of the earth, pleading the earthly cause of earthly people, or
digging caves and holes in the earth to secure an earthly peace to your selves.

Its high time to withstand you, and to rebuke this destroying Angel; for it is
not men only that suffer from your violence, but the Lord; your sword goes so
deep, That it peirces through his soul also: You are gone so far in
dissolving the foundations of government, that you are come to him that upholds
the pillars of the earth: You reach to the head of principalities and powers,
to the Lord who is the author and upholder of all these things; he is in these
poor, broken and despised Ordinances of his, and sensible of every blow that is
given to them: You have dug through the wall of flesh and men, and broke
down that partition wall that divided them from God; and now you are in the
bowels of the Lord, these miserable, broken powers are now the Lord: Go on to
tear and rend, you will at last look upon him whom you have peirced, and
mourn.

The King and Parliament cry unto God in their distress, saying, Doubtless
thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge
us not, Thou, O Lord art our Father, our Redeemer. Though you in the greatness
of your faith, and confidence in your privileges, as high as Abraham and
Israel in your literal form, do not know them, yet the Lord ownes them, and
will hear their cry and deliver them.

Your proceedings are against the Lord; and though you say these things you do
must be done till Christ come; and when he comes, then it is true, there will
need none of these things to secure your selves, but as yet you must act as
men: In this, you say, your Lord delays his coming, and so drunk with your
prosperity and victories, you beat your fellow servants.

But here you will find your Lord in an hour that you were not aware of: You
say he will come and destroy you and your ways in time, but he is already upon
you, and your are not aware of it, and cuts you asunder; opens your inward
parts, divides the secrets of your hearts, and appoints you a portion with
hypocrites and unbelievers, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth: You act
against God, and God against you; Your souls loath him, his soul loathes you.

Finally, Here Is nothing written but what is written in your hearts; it is the
opening your own souls; it is but what you have feared, and that punishment
which your own humiliations and confessions have acknowledged just and due to
you* Nothing but what I have suffered for acting in those ways in which you
are; What measure has been measured to me by Gad, that do I measure to you:
And as I lay it on you, so I suffer it with you, and shall, be content to
suffer till you are restored from this condition, of shame and wrath, to honor
and love, and dwell with you in these everlasting burnings, which will purify
you from all your filth. Till then, Farewell.

I am W. Sedgwick.

Justice upon the Army Remonstrance.
THERE is, and always has been in all things in the world, some good, some
evil, some light. some darkness: And in this declining state of things, the
world grows worse and worse, and they that act for it and in it, though under
very specious pretenses of justice, are still more base and filthy then those
that have, gone before; every generation having a more evil and less good
then their predecessors. I know there be many good men amongst you, and that
you have since the wrack of the Kingdom borne up gallantly, as if you would
outlive the storm; That you have worn many favors of God, above, and
against others; That you have owned your selves to be the people of God, and
God by many outward mercies has owned you: But in this work you manifestly
show, that you have deeply revolted; and that after you had escaped the
polutions of the world, you are again entangled therein, and over come; And
with the dog, returned to your own, and others, vomit: to lick up the filth
of the world, which others, having drunk the Wine of the wrath of God, have
spued up; You have been exalted unto heaven, and are brought down to hell: You
have back-slidden from a formal and carnal profession of the Kingdom of
Christ living in God, etc. to embrace the tail of this present evil world, to
petty, beggarly, unbelieving, malicious projects for self safety. And as you
have left God, and waxed wanton, upon his blessings, so he now has left you;
has made your table to become your snare; fatted you up by former mercies, to
receive your last and greatest judgments: What you had is taken from you, and
your wisdom, majesty, largeness and goodness, that has sometimes appeared
in you in other things, is turned now into distracted stumbers, dark and sad
dreams of ruin, into uncertain, loose, wandering fancyes of your own woeful
condition, and absurd shadows and vain imaginations of ways of deliverance:
Poor wretches though, angry at you, yet my soul pitties you; never were men
caught in such a snare of the Devil as you are; glorying you are in your own
righteous cause, and confident of your innocence and success; And indeed you
are shut up in a pit of darkness, and already lost in divine displeasure.

As there are good men amongst you, so there is, I confess, some good lies
scattered in this Remonstrance; The Lord is in it; But as two legs, or a
piece of an ear in the mouth of a Lion. So torn in pieces, and almost
devoured by that roaring Lion, that wrathful, cruel, malicious beast, the
Devil, that it I should take pains to bring it forth to your view, it would
most displease and offend you; you could not bear the sight of it, but would
your selves hate it; therefore I will not loose my labor in it.

But the evil part is so gross and visible, that I can with most ease deal
with it, and for the present with most profit to you. And when that heap of
dirt and folly is brought forth, and you made sensible of it, the good that
lies now buried in it, will be released, and delight to come forth in you. It
will be the greatest mercy to the holy One in you, to give a severe sentence
against that wicked part that at this time prevails so much in you.

In dealing with this work of yours, I shall not trouble my self to follow you
in all those crooked ways, confused and multiplied parenthesis, dark and vain
tautologies, in which you are lost and grope: But well knowing your principles
upon which you go, as I find them expressing themselves, I shall show you the
evil and folly of them, and that with such plainness, as the wiser and
soberer of you shall be convinced and brought forth, the rest condemned in
themselves, and the world may run headlong to their destruction, and dash
themselves in pieces against that rock of justice that falls upon them.

In the first part of your preamble you tell us of your tender regard to the
privileges and freedom of Parliament: Wherein you deal very deceitfully with
the world, and conceal your own principles; For upon this ground you know you
act, that the powers of this world are to be broken into pieces; That the
Parliament is one of the powers of the world, and that you are called to break
them in pieces: And therefore it becomes you (you know) to be steeld with
stoutnesse and resolution, to trample upon all authorities that stand up
against that justice of God that acts you: The privilege of Parliament is a
poor, corrupted thing, to that extraordinary presence of God that goes with
you, and those high undertakings that you have in hand for the public good,
and the eternal salvation of the people: You should do as you have done,
break through these spider-webs of privilege and freedom of Parliament, and
immediately go through all to that glorious work of yours; and not suppress
your own principles, to court the world into a deceived opinion of tender
regard to them. Indeed the privilege and freedom of Parliament is gone and
lost long ago, and you do but fancy one; for a new and true privilege and
freedom does not yet appear to you, neither can you own them.

In the next part of your preamble you tell us the reasons of your present
declaring your selves, because things are [brought to the utmost crisis of
danger] It Is true this, but you make a very ill use of it: There is two in the
Kingdom, the holy one our life, peace, union, agreement, etc. whom you have
not seen yet: and a wicked one, which is wrath, malice, death, revenge, etc.
These two are now conflicting together: The holy one would establish love,
bearing one with another, forgiving one another, self-denial, etc. The
destroyer would continue mischeifs, wars, accusations, cruelties, etc. The
contention grows sharp, and the evil one making his utmost and last
resistance.

Now we that see the power of truth and love, are at rest, being assured, that
the righteous Lord is above all.

But here you come with your woeful fears, and say [which calls upon every man
to contribute what help be can:] Do not you know yet, that vain is the help
of man: You and all men come to offer help, but it is to a wicked world, to
bring fuel to the fire of wrath; for fear, misery and destruction should
cease raging; Cease from man whose breath is in his nostrils: A proud and empty
thing: and cease you foolish men from blowing the coals of division amongst
us: (And seeing, no effectual help from else where appear) your curse is not
to see when good comes: We see salvation is nigh them that fear him, that
glory may dwell in cur land; God a present help in the time of trouble: You
are blind, and cannot see the Lord our effectual Savior An enemy would make
this sense of your words: War is your life, and seeing peace ready to come,
and no effectual help appears to lengthen out misery, and destroy the
Treaty, you will do it.

And now you give us the ground of your undertaking th^s work, (Conscience,
and duty to God and men obliges) you sleighty pass over this which should be
fully cleared; and the reason is, you are not upon a sound foundation; nor dare
you come to a strict examination of your own ground, but are hurried on
blindly, upon weak passions of fear, jealousy, necessity, etc. without any
sound bottom. This likewise I observe from your words here, and from some
conference with some of you, that you know not which of these two to take for
your principle, God or man; but are in a lukewarm condition, neither hot nor
cold; neither hot enough in the spirit of God, to do all things in a divine
way: nor so cold, as to submit to the laws of men. In discourse with some of
you against your proceedings, that they were contrary to the royal law, the
Will and Way of our Father; Which is, To do good to them that hate us, and
persecute us; to forgive our enemies; to overcome evil with good; to conquer
by esuffering and love: They have professed, that in these things they act as
men, in a civil respect; which in you that own your selves to be godly,
spiritual men, and to have the power of godliness, is great impiety: For you
in your affairs openly and professedly to decline the perfect way of Christ,
and go to the ways of the Heathen; to lay aside, exclude and thrust out the
heavenly man and his light, that you may please your selves in the darkness of
men. You do fully manifest not being Christian, divine, holy in all things,
that truly you are so in nothing, and so your religion is vain: Or that you
are fallen from God to man; You begun in the spirit, and end in the flesh, and
so Christ is of none effect at all; for he that does not do all things in the
power of God, he does nothing in it: You forget that speech of Saint Paul, You
walk as men, are you not carnal?

When we say, if you will walk as men, you must submit to your Governors,
live under humane Laws, and be subject to them: then you fly from such ordinary
things to an extraordinary call, as Phineas; to be carried by the mighty power
and presence of God: that you in all things are as the Israelites in the
wilderness; to have a Pillar of Cloud by day, and Fire by night to go before
you: Thus you halt between two opinions, and gad about to change your way; and
are true to nothing, neither God nor man; but become as those Beasts in the
Revelations, that have many heads and crowns upon them: your ways are beastly,
cruel, absurd, monstrous with many heads; yet you will be crowned with the most
glorious titles of the presence of God, the people of God, the cause of God:
Therefore know this, though you would shuffle up your ground work, Conscience
and duty to God and men, you shall not: For a conscience guided by the wisdom
and power of God scorns such base and unworthy ways as you walk in: and those
men that you think are far below you scorn to lift up themselves above theit
superiors, and to Lord it over King and Parliament as you do; nor dare
continue in arm^s against command of God and men, and uphold a company of vile
and wicked wrecches (only for their own safety) to the wasting and destroying
of their Country.

Now you begin another part of your preamble, wherein you say that that rule of
Salus populi, suprema lex, is of all others most apt to be abused: You have all
pretended to this maxim, but have miserably abused it, and the people too: a
company of deceivers and mountebanks that talk of curing, saving, delivering,
but all wast, spoil and destroy the people.

We shall ere long see, that Suprema lex, that law of love, the mercy and
goodness of the most high God, is only Salus populi, the salvation of the
People of England; its misse-applyed so long as any man assumes it to himself.

And here for two or three pages you are trimming your way to seek love as the
Prophet says; you put an excellent dress upon your work, and daub over a
rotten sepulcher, wherein there is nothing but dead men's bones; with a show of
wisdom, as if you would out the hair of justice, and go away more exact then
all that have gone before you; a pure medium 'tween all excreams; avoiding all
the rocks of Levellers and Cavaliers; of all rashness and evil intentions, in
which work you wrap up your selves in such a mi^t of circum-locutions, and are
in such a wood of long and tedious expressions that as Solomon says, Are too
wonderful for me!

You are in this discourse, An Eagle in the air; carried a loft by the prince
of the air in your own fancyes: A serpent on a rock, a crooked serpent,
winding and turning this way and that way upon a rock of confidence of God and
your own wisdom. A ship in the midst of the sea: You are gone from all firm
land, from all solid principles of goodness, and are tossed about in a sea of
weakness and confusion. And the way of a man with a maid: You are lusting
after your Mistress, honor; and to enjoy her, nimbly fly from one secret place
to another to hide your selves from shame: such is the way of your adulterous
spirits; being gone from your husband, the Lord, to the world: You eat up
King, Parliament and People, to satisfy your carnal love of safety and an
outward Kingdom, and wipe your mouths with some fine language, and say you
have done no wickedness: you may deceive your selves, but cannot deceive either
God or man: it is very plain, that when you have multiplied your vain words,
your swelling words to justify your selves, it is but the atire of a harlot;
and every one will see that you do but darken counsel by words without
knowledge; and while you think to make your selves more vendible, you make your
selves more abominable.

There be many particulars in this part worth answering; but those things
wherein any show of strength lies, you make often use of them, and we shall
meet with them again he reafter, and therefore for present shall pass them
over.

From the seventh to the twelfth page, you are relating how the Parliament
Voted no more addresses, and how they were turned into this course of the
Treaty. It were exceeding easy to show in several particulars, of your
discourse, that you do, in favor to your selves, abuse the Parliament and
others; and in most things accuse others of those things that you your selves
are guilty of: but I shall leave that to some other Pen that loves to deal in
such things: I would in all things discover to you how unchristian your charges
are; In sum, you here lay open the instability of the Parliament, and by what
means they were tossed from one thing to another, and so declare the evil
practices of the Kings party; in both you are very large, and very harsh to
both; without any molifying oil, or mirigating mercy; having nothing else in
your eye but to cover your own shame, and as fully as you can, discover others,
to ease your selves and load others: It Is Christ's work to excuse others, and
pity them, Father forgive them they know not what they do; and to take the
burden and guilt upon himself, to bear our sins; he is made sin for us:
but it is your work to condemn others, and justify your selves Christ pities
others when he suffers by their hands: you are cruel and merciless to others
when they suffer under your hands: such infinite distance is there between your
spirits, and the Spirit of the Lord.

The poor Parliament, for their sins, are shattered and broken, full of
perplexity; the whole Kingdom full of discontent against them; and they reeling
this way and that way to save themselves and the Kingdom, and know not how to
do it.

The Kings party for their sins, likewise lying under sore burdens, heavy
pressures, and struggling to get from under their intolerable afflictions, but
cannot. And in all these afflictions, our Lord is afflicted, and bears al our
infirmities, they lie upon Christ's shoulders; and you seeing the Kingdom, and
the Lord of the Kingdom) lying like the poor man, traveling from Jerusalem to
Jericho, wounded and half dead; not only pass by, as the Priest and the
Levite, and leave it to sink under its misery; but delight to tear and rend
its wounds, to keep them open that they may bleed continually: In all not a Word
of peace or pity to any; as dry and hard as the rock: you have no balm at al
for our wounds, nothing of the good Samaritan: but vinegar, piercing, accusing,
condemning speeches; as Flesh-flies, living upon the putrified sores, so do
you find ease, pleasure, and life to your cause upon the filth and ruin of
the Nation: In this you are as the man possessed with the Devil, you are led by
a dark, foul spirit, to walk and live amongst the graves, conversing with the
dead carcass of the Kingdom; you stretch out the line of confusion upon the
Kingdom, and gather together the stones of emptiness: you make long furrows
upon the backs of the people, intend our ruin to the furthest; and bring in to
our desolate Nation, the wild beast of the desert to meet with wild beasts of
the Islands; the Satyr to cry to his fellow, the Screech-Owle, and the great
Owl to lay and hatch; and the Vultures with their mates: all these dance
together in your discourse, which is black as pitch, dark and uncomfortable as
the night, and threatening to add misery upon misery upon us, and not a syllable
of healing mercy in any: sure your nature is to take pleasure, to wallow and
tumble in our Nations woes. Give me leave to tell the storyafter you, and to
relate the business thus.

Once our King and Parliament, or People, lived quietly and lovingly together,
embraced in the arms of divine goodness, prospered together as Husband and
Wife, till their iniquities on both sides broke this union: and being parted by
their jealousies and lusts, after many unkind blows betwixt them; The
Parliament the Wife, in a high rage, at the remembrance of al her Lords
unkindnesse, and giving too much ear to her own passion, and the accusations
of adultery, and provoaked by a multitude of perplexities, Voted no move
Addresses: She would have nothing to do with her Husband, but would forsake
him for ever and be divorced from him; and then you who always have lusted
after the Royal Bed, encourage her with thanks, and court her for your selves.

But ere long the natural1 affections of these two divided friends, though much
clogd with jealousies and discontents, begins to work toward each other, which
may be interrupted for a season, but cannot be totally extinguished: The
Parliament finding nothing but distraction, dishonor, with scorn and misery in
a solitary state, and finding her self unable to satisfy her unquiet children
without their Father, begins to think how she may again recover her own head
and husband, and to this purpose Voted a personal Treaty with the King.

And now we are fallen upon the principal and main subject of your
Remonstrance, to show the evil and danger of this Personal Treaty, in page 12.
etc. you fall directly upon (this miserable inconvenience of a Personal
Treaty) and elsewhere (miserable insnaring Treaty) It seems this Treaty does
very much offend, you declare so bitterly against it: It Is true, while things
are at this imperfect state, it is a very easy matter to accuse or condemn any
person or thing, but a hard matter to justify or save any thing; that is the
work of the devil, this is the work of God. I confess this Treaty is a poor,
low, dark thing, neither party managing of it with that clearnes and brightness
of love and goodness that I could wish: that it does not for the present give
satisfaction to any side: and being infirm you have great advantage in
appearing against it, and some show of reason for it; and therefore your acting
against it may do some good to clear it from some evil that adheres to it:
for this is my mind, you nor none else can do any hurt to him, or them, that
are truly good: but all things, be they never so evil in themselves, work
together unanimously and constantly for their good: For this Treaty, there is a
blessing, destroy it not; the seed of peace is in it, and it will thrive and
flourish; act what you can against it, you cannot destroy peace or union, that's
the Lords.

In this dark business where the King and Parliament are groping together to
find a little ease and rest for themselves, being wearied with the miseries of
war, does the Lord come as a thief in the night; so that if both parties
should design by it to cosen the world, and one another, the thiese would
cozen them both: I mean, steal away their evil lusts and sins, and bring
good out of it against the designs of men; and if you would trample upon it,
because its low and poor; and be jealous of it as dangerous and insnaring; he
will deceive you too, and make it for your good and peace as well as others, and
against your present thoughts of strife, steal into your breasts, and beget
love and peace there also. This is the robbery of this thief in the night, to
steal away evil from us, and surprise us with good.

Your fiery contention therefore against it will be very useful; twill burn
up those doubts and fears that are on either side; melt each other into a
closer union: The root of it being the divine love; all you do against it will
but quicken that principle, and spur them on to a more hearty and earnest
closing: and while you endeavor to rende them from each other, they will
clapse the faster about each other, and turn all their contention against you,
who from your present promoting of differences, will be suspected to be the
authors of all their strife.

Let us now examine the reasons you give against a Treaty, page 14, etc. You
first quere, and then declare, that it is not just and good, nor safe; and so
all along you insist upon these two things, satis faction and security; To
prove the justice of it, you state the interests of the Kingdom and
Parliament, as they have been the matter of our quarrel: In which we find
these faults.

First, You would make your own and the public interest to be one; they are
so much different, that you are feign to patch them up together often, and
bring in yours in a parenthesis; as here, page 14. (though even the particular
safety of such as have engaged for the public is not to be neglected) In this
and in the rest of your discourse, it appears, you conceive your selves
neglected and left out in the Treaty; and you do by this require your own
interest to be considered; and that is very obstructive to peace, for men in a
distracted Kingdom to uphold a particular interest, thwarting the general,
peace and union, the common interest of all States, and with violence to
enforce it to the ruin of the whole.

That which you offer to us is not the public, but your particular interest;
which indeed is not your interest neither, but a rent and division an erroneous
opinion. For that there be a common and supreme council, that the power of
making laws, choosing officers, punishing offenders, be in them, etc. Its very
apparent that this is not half the interest of the Kingdom, it is much too
narrow for a rich, honorable nation: Generally you know the people of England
desire peace, settled religion, established truth, freedom of trade, and this
with His Majesty, under their King, that he may govern them according to their
honest and known laws, that they may live in prosperity and honor: For these
devised things, you propose the people know them not, affect them less then
know them; they are invented only to please and secure your selves, and to pull
down Monarchy, against which you would make your selves irreconcilable: These
principles are but the ax or knife, to prune and cut the extravagancies of
Monarchy or tyranny; and if all the Kingdom were an ax or knife, we were in an
ill case: You are but a part, and alas, an inconsiderable part; not one of an
hundred will own what you set down as the public interest; and a diseased
part; a bone started out of his place; a piece of timber, that is gone from the
whole frame of the Kingdom, which is large, and consists of King, Lords,
Commons, with innumerable, excellent branches growing out of these.

Now this were a strange cure, to break off the bones in the body, to bring
the whole to one dis-jointed part, or to force the whole house to come after
one piece that is started out, is il workmanship. It Is a strange thing that men
should place the welfare of the Kingdom in such inconsiderable things:
Methinks it is a wonder, that men should bring forth some pedantick conceits, and
then magnify them so far, as entitle them to the whole Kingdom. Thus will
mean and narrow spirits do, when they intrude themselves into public
affairs: When soldiers, men of private spirits, confident of their ability
and judgment in greatest matters, shall produce brats of their own brain,
and impose them upon the nation, we shall be slaves indeed.

Secondly, That you that are Christians, that talk of the reign of Christ and
of the Saints, should now engage your selves to so base an interest as this is;
that you will espouse so poor a quarrel, which, in sum; is to throw down a
King and Lords, and set up the people: That all power should be in the hands of
the Parliament, and that to be certain, and in the hands of a subordinate
officer to call, etc. Will the establishing of this satisfy you for all the
bloodshed, estates ruined, etc? is this your satisfaction? should you not
rather propose, that all power, and dominion, and reign should be given to the
Lord, that King, and Parliament, and People, and all should be filled with the
righteousness and goodness of God? But these things are too good to be spoken
of, beyond your faith ever to see it: But I Will tell you, if this be not your
interest to have God all in all, to fill every thing, and to have all things
offered up to him in truth and righteousness: your interest and Gods are more
divided then yours and the Kings; and if you adhere to that you have proposd,
you forsake your own interest, and espouse the Devils, the God of this world,
the Destroyer, and will perish with him.

Thirdly, This is a fault that you all along carry the interest of the public
in opposition to the Kings; which is a wicked thing to divide them that God
has joined: wherein you do, as sword; men, cut in pieces, and indeed destroy
and mangle, not only the Kingdom, but the word, Interest, which is of a
uniting signification; inter esse is to be in or amongst each other: The
public has its interest in the King, and the King his interest in the
public; or they have the same esse, or interest, which is to be together in
each other; the King is in the people, and the people in the King; the Kings
being is not absolute, or alone, but an interest, as he is in union with, and
relation to his people, which are his strength and life; and the peoples being
is not naked or solitary, but an interest in the greatness and wisdom of
their King, who is their life and honor: And though you will dis-join your
selves from Kings, God will not, neither will I; God is King of Kings; Kings
and Princes God, as well as peoples; their, God as well as ours, and theirs
eminently, as that spaech enforces God of Israel, Israel, God above all the
nations; so King of Kings, Kings God more then of common men; and by near and
especial kindred and communion; assuming their titles and honor, and giving
them his majesty and dominion; Kinglinesse agrees with all Christians who are
of a royal nature, made Kings with Christ, and cannot but be friends to it,
being of kin to it; the children of God, borne of the King of heaven, are men
of honor (not in a base, vain way, but in a true, just way) and if there be
not Kings to honor, they would want, objects to bestow that fulness of honon
that is in their breasts; would lose the greatest part of their delight, which
is majesty and glory, would want occasion of expressing their high and noble
spirits: It Is a bastard religion that is inconsistent with the majesty and
greatness of the most absolute Monarch; and such spirits are strangers from
the Kingdom of heaven, and know not the glory in which God lives, and are of
narrow and evil minds that are corrupt themselves, and not able to bear
greatness, and so think God will not, or cannot qualify men for such high
places, with answerable and proportionable power and, goodness: You are indeed
much in the flesh, in a form of religion which is weak and of a parting
nature, cannot conceive nor comprehend things in union; you are dividing still
tweene heaven and earth, 'tweene God and King; you cannot own them in union, and
so divide King and people: but the spirit of God is large, and reconciles,
composes, gathers all into one, into Christ; God and man into one person; head
and members into one body. This love you know not, that embraces God and the
King in one person, and King and people in one body.

A fourth fault is, in your further stating of the controversy 'tweene King and
Parliament, you bring in, in the second place, religion; the order shows the
present frame of your spirits, first the world, and then godliness: But in
this you err exceedingly, in putting all the enmity against godliness and the
power of it, on the Kings part, and charging it upon him as his interest, and
assuming all religion and godliness to your selves.

Upon this ground stands much of the controversy between the Cavaliers and
you; that they are wicked, you godly; they enemies to God, you Saints; they
darkness, you light, and therefore as you say afterward, What fellowship has
light with darkness? This is a ground (if it stand good) of an everlasting
quarrel; and if it falls, I hope some of the edge of your contention may be
taken off.

The answer of this is as proper for me as any; who, you know, do well
understand the utmost of the religion you walk in, and have been exercisd in
it with as much exactness, faithfulness, power and comfort as any of you:
Your consciences, many of you, can bear witness of the uprightness and
efficacy of my conversation amongst you; and that I was, when I was with you,
not only a companion, but a leader to you in the best things: and since have
been tried by very great sufferings, and made a spectacle to God and men, and
been publicly set up as a mark, for all men to shoot their opinions and
judgments at, and dare challenge the whole earth, the Lord being my
Righteousness to accuse me of any injustice to God or man: and now must
testify concerning you and my self with you, that that way wherein you walk
is not the power of godliness, but a poor, weak, fleshly form.

You are indeed Saints by intention, counsel, hope; you aim at it, look for
it: but in your present state you are carnal, and walk in the flesh in great
infirmity: that your state at best was but to be as the Jews, having a form
of knowledge according to the letter of the law: which form is now corrupted,
left and forsaken of God, and you are become, through blindness and ignorance,
enemies to the spirit, and to the Cross of Christ: You live not the life of
Christ; you are not dead to the world, nay, you oppose that death; you will not
suffer with Christ; you have not the spirit of God; walk not in your affairs
in the wisdom and strength of God, nor in the love of God; you know not the
mind of God, have not communion with God; what ever you do, or have done, you
do it by the strength of man, and not by the power of God; and now lest to a
poor, blind, unstable way, not knowing whether you go, your ways being
dark and slippery, and yet glorying in fleshly and outward things; mistaking
earthy and common blessings for heavenly and inward; crying up the Lord, the
Lord, when you do the works of the Devil: The Holy God will no longer suffer
you to wear those names of Saints and Godly, but will cast dung upon your
solemn feasts, and curse your blessings, and discover you to be but whited
sepulchers, and cause your rottenness to come forth, uncover your nakedness
before the nation, that al may abhor and loath that outward, formal religion
which you profess; it does and will more stink in the nostrils of those
people that have no knowledge of God, to see pride, self-love, contention for
the world, rebellion, falsehood, folly and hatred of God, to be in such zealous
pretenders to the spirit of God.

As you have not the power of godliness, so you have many visible, gross
lusts and evil principles which moral men do oppose in you; you are not
pure, nor is it only for your purity (as you suppose) that the Kings party
oppose you, but for your withstanding some things that are good in them, and
such as their consciences are bound by God to prosecute; though there be that
wickedness in many of them too, to hate that of God that has appeared in you,
because different from theirs: but their opposition is not directly against the
face of God, for that never shined forth clearly in us, but against that
particular form, as destructive to theirs, and our carnal principles which
were contrary to theirs, and those obscured with many infirmities too: so that
it is high pride for us to think that we are all Saints, godly, etc. and they
enemies to God, because to us.

And 2. It is as much uncharitableness to judge them, as altogether in the
dark; for though they are indeed visibly in greater looseness many of them,
and more in the condition of the Centiles, living more manifestly according to
the course of the world, etc. yet in many things you have justified their
principles as more righteous then yours; and many of their persons more sober,
patient, loving, gentle, yea more knowing and discerning in the things of God
then you: And though there be amongst that party the greatest, visible and
moral wickedness, yet there is among you the greatest enmity and malignancy
to the spirit of God; the greatest pride, hypocrisy, self confidence, and
spiritual wickedness.

And this you will know that thus judge after the flesh, that those Publicans
and Harlots shall enter into the Kingdom of God before you: Many of them shall
come from the East and from the West, and from the remotest parts of the earth,
and greatest distance from God, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in
the Kingdom of God, and you shall be thrust out: Therefore this manner of
judging of yours, of accounting them evil, and your selves good, is one of
those strong delusions spoken of; whereby you are,

First, Led to the destroying of others as righteous as your selves.

S^condly, Kept off from the sight of your own iniquities, and and making
war with them: for indeed these two parties are within you; and if you were
not kept by this formally, fleshly opposing of sin in others, you would have
no other contention but with sin in your own breasts, to destroy those
works of the Devil in which you are bound.

Till you lay down this fleshly war with others, and begin that spiritual
war with Antichrist, Malignants, etc. in your own hearts you will never have
peace: And to satisfy you and all parts in the Kingdom concerning these
oppositions and contests in religious matters, it is thus.

All men are in the dark, and know not the whole body of divine truth, only
lay hold each of some part of it; So that truth, which is one in it self in,
and amongst the darkness of men is divided, cut in pieces, and lies scattered
about here and there; and every one holds what ha holds in enmity and
contrariety to others, and through pride and malice with that good that is in
him, opposes God and goodness in others; that by this all may be ashamed and
broken in pieces, and become guilty before God, and made at last to come down
from their proud conceits, and see they are fools, and know nothing as they
ought to know, and to be willing to learn of others.

After you have stated the controversy to prove the injustice of an
accommodation, you fall upon the King, judging him in the highest manner, as
guilty of the foulest treason, murder, etc. and that too in a most unpardonable
and irreconcilable way, as incapable of mercy, and beyond all peace and
accommodation: There is nothing wherein the Devil is more exercisd, then in
accusing; from which he has his name: and there is nothing wherein he has
more corrupted the nature of man in these last days, then this; it being that
general form into which he has cast the spirits of men, whence they are
called, 2 Timothy 3.3. (...), Accusers, or in plain English, Devils: Men are now
very ordinarily, and with a show of justice, Devils one to another.

This is common amongst men, especially amongst religious and professing men;
The Scribes and Pharisees, men in the highest form of religion, are the most
guilty of it, thinking ordinarily that they have right to judge; and this is
notoriously your sin in this work. To destroy it in you and others, we shall
set set out the evil of it, as it has been expressed in some Scriptures.

Romans 2.1. Thou art unexcusable, Oh man, whosoever thou art, that judge; God
has reserved the authority of judgment to himself, who is and will be Judge
of all; its proper for God only, who knows hearts; who only knows good and
evil; who can save as well as destroy; and therefore not fit for man, who can
do neither good nor evil; at best he cannot save, and therefore most unfit to
be a judge: Therefore you, whosoever you are, be you never so good men,
religious men, blessed with never so great favors, you have nothing to do to
judge while you are men.

If it be objected, then there should be no Judges amongst men. I answer,
Judges are Gods; I have said ye are Gods: and if they have not the power and
goodness of God, as well as the place and title, they are Idols, Heathen Gods;
and when we say, God is Judge alone, we mean not God out of, but in man; or
man taken up into the Righteousness and Authority of God, man sanctified by
God.

Secondly, Man, a judge, is inexcusable; he that will be a judge, is supposed
to be so high in holiness, so innocent as needs no excuse; he that is in the
nature of God, it is a shame for him to think of an excuse, It Is my infirmity, I
am a sinner; but I have a Savior: It Is a dangerous thing therefore, being men,
and needing excuse for your weakness, that you presume to be judges, and put
your selves out of excuse; you cannot say you are ignorant, no, you are wise
judges; you cannot say you are weak, no, you are strong to sentence others;
you cannot say you are sinners, being judges of the law you may not be thought
breakers.

Or for a vile man to lift up himself in the place of God, to be so sottishly
blind in himself, as not to see his own filthiness, and conceive himself a
God, it is a presumption that admits of no excuse it is so gross: or for a man to
be so cruel to his brother as to judge him and thrust him out of the grace of
God, is so Diabolical, as there is no excuse for it; by doing this men show
them* selves Devils, for whom there is no mercy, no favor.

It follows, For wherein thou judge another, thou condemnest thy self; for
thou that judge do the same things. There is a fellowship in evil as in
good: every man while he is a sinner has in him whatever any sinner has; as
every righteous man has what ever another righteous man has: If you judge any
part of your nature, you judge the whole: If a man that lives in the world,
then your selves, your spirits, principles, actions, which are all worldly and
sinful: Especially and particularly, what ever any party accuses another of
concerning these wars, they themselves do the same things: To instance in
the present case.

You judge the King guilty of breaking Covenant, of betraying trust, have we
not broke our oath of Allegiance to him, and betrayed the trust he put in his
people? and have not we likewise betrayed that trust the Parliament put in us,
when after promises of subjection to them, the Army refused, and made war
with them?

You judge him guilty of all the blood, rapine, spoil: Dare any man say he is
not guilty of it? Were we absolute in taking up arms, in prosecuting the
war, in continuing in arms? Is there not in all, self-love, malice, revenge,
envy, distrust of God? Had we been rightly carried in freeing England from
oppression, we had freely laid down our lives in a voluntary suffering, and
that would have saved the Kingdom; whereas by our rash running to force, we
are guilty of the miseries of war as well as the King: But in continuing the
Army after your enemies subdued, you are manifestly guilty of the present
oppression upon the poor people; of the intolerable burden of free quarter,
and unreasonable taxes.

You charge him for seeking to set up his own interest of will and power. Do
you not do the same thing? What do you now but set up will and power? Going
beside all Law and right, to set up the worst will and power, the will and
power of People, of the sword: Therefore let me expostulate with you, as that
Apostle, Thou that say a man should not steal, do thou steal? etc. Thou
that have so much light as to oppose tyranny, art thou the veriest tyrant? Thou
that plead'ft for Laws, art thou greatest violater of Laws? We will go further
with the Apostle; Thou that abhorrest Idols, do thou commit sacrilege? You
abhor his ways as gross; but you have more secret and close iniquities; you
rob God even of his Throne, setting up your formal religion in the place of
God: you complain of shedding innocent blood, and you shed the truly innocent
blood of Christ: Of Rapine and spoil, and you daily spoil the Temple of God,
your own bodies and souls with your noisome lusts. Afterward verse 3.
Think thou this, O man, that judge them that do such things, and do
the same, that thou shall escape the judgment of God? He that judges is
guilty, and his guilt begins to stir in him: God begins to write bitterness in
the conscience, and then to save himself, he begins to judge others; judgment
of men is the constant effect of troubled spirits; and this is your condition,
you are restless in your selves, you find God frowning upon you for your
sins, that makes you seek for fatis faction for blood, that it may be
expiated, and the wrath of God appeased: The fire is kindled in your own
hearts, your tongues are set on fire of hell. If you had the peace of God upon
true grounds you would be still; or if your consciences were besprinckled with
the blood of Christ, you would not seek for expiation: But there is the voice
of thy brothers blood, the blood of: Abel cries, not the blood of Christ. The
blood of Christ, if you knew it, cries peace, reconciliation, union, favor,
love, taking away enmity. The blood of Abel for revenge, for justice: this is
your voice, which shows, a Cains spirit; you are troubled for your sins;
Think thou to escape the righteous judgment of God, no, thou art running
farther into it; you are not quitting your selves, but increasing your evils:
Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness: God has been gracious unto you,
and re priev'd you for a while from destruction; do you thus abuse it to
harden your hearts to pride, malice and wicked insulting over your brethrent is
this the use of your Victories, to have oportunities to do more mischief? And
so treasure up wrath for your selves: For all that you lay upon others, you,
provide it and store it up for your selves. God has declared, you know, rich
mercy to the King and his party, in my Book called, The Leaves of the Tree of
Life: You despise this rich mercy, scorn it, and set up your mercylesse
justice against it; Not knowing that the goodness of God leads to repentance:
you require repentance before mercy: Gods goodness goes before, and leads to
repentance; and that goodness that has been manifest, though you ignorantly
despise it, counting it folly and madness, upon no other ground but because
it is too rich and good for you to apprehend; it shall produce its own effect in
power, and manifest your ungodliness in contradicting of it: And know you,
that no man shall appear either directly or indirectly against it, but he
shall by it discover the evil of his own heart, and manifest that he walks
in darkness, and knows not the glorious counsel of the Lord.

There is one place more I would have the world consider, and it would make
them afraid of judging: Math. 7.1, etc. Judge not that you be not judged: You
have judged the King and his party; for it you shall be judged, I Will judge you;
And what judgment ye judge, you shall have; that measure that you give him
you shall receive: You exclude him from peace, you have none your selves: You
thrust him from mercy, you have no mercy your selves: You live not in the
enjoyment of divine love, if you did, you could not be so cruel as you are,
such enemies to peace: You are that evil servant, God has forgiven you ten
thousand talents, you come and take your fellow servant by the throat for an
hundred pence: The Lord is wrath with you, and now your forgiveness is recald,
and you must pay the utmost farthing: You shall not have mercy, as you have had
it, freely, but you shall suffer for it: You remember the Kings finnes, God
will remember yours again: Know this, you are not in the Kingdom of God, nor
blessed; if you were, you would be peacemakers; for Blessed are the
peacemakers, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven; they that are blessed by
the enjoyment of God, and in the light of Gods Kingdom they see all things in
union, the King one with God; and the Parliament and people one with the King;
they are one in God in his largeness of love, but you are cursing, dividing,
and so are in the Kingdom of darkness and the Devil: This is your judgment,
all the evil that you bring forth is within you; it is your own, though you
will fix it upon another; if it were not in you, you would not, could not
produce it.

And why beholdest thou the mote in thy brothers eye, but considerest not the
beam that is in thine own eye, etc. The evils that you charge the King and
his party with, though great in your narrow minds, are but motes in the
account of God; your smalnesse aggravates them, his largeness lessens them; He
that counts the nations as a drop of a bucket, and dust of the balance, counts
these miscarriages that are amongst the nations a very small matter, easily
blows away that which you silly creatures lift at as mountains, toil and
sweat at it to bring forth ruin from it: It Is but a mote to a godly heart,
easily forgiven; and a mote in the eye, hindering sight; the King and his party
many of them saw no better; thought they ought to defend their right against us
that rebeld: And now its a more in the eye indeed, it vexes them they are
afflicted for it under the hand of God, and that's your cruelty; You persecute
him whom the Lord has finitten, and talk to the grief of those whom God has
wounded: But you have a beam in your eye: Your sins are greater, being
aggravated by many mercies, much light that others have not enjoyed: your sin
is a beam; your religion, strength, upon which you lean and lay so much
weight, that's become an iniquity, and a beam in your eye, that you cannot
distinguish any thing, nor discern good from evil, but are stark blind, you
cannot see your brethren, but judge them enemies; and enemies are not fit
judges: and if you could see them, brethren, you would not judge them as you
do; you cannot see to pull out the mote, to take away the evil, and leave the
eye, but you are pulling out the eye, the eye of the Kingdom, one that is the
apple of Gods eye: of whom he fares, Touch it not: not the eye only, but the
head, and so the whole body, taking away the eye, that you may lead the body
whether you please.

Having taken this power of judging out of your hands, and showed your sin and
shame in presuming upon it; We shall now consider some grounds you lay down
why the King is not to be received again to peace, nor restored to his office
and dignity: And we shall in the view of them see how much your injustice is
against God, and your selves, in that where you profess for justice.

First, You insist upon this, page 24. God has given him so clearly in your
hands to do justice, and afterward God has given a double judgment against
him, etc. And elsewhere you, page 5. to set forth Gods favor to you, you say,
God makes have to judgment, and has appeared as a severe avenger: It Is true,
God has judged the King again and again, and dealt very severely with Him;
He is the greatest sufferer in the Kingdom, having lost His Crown, Honor,
Family, Liberty, Revenue, etc. And you thrive, increase in wealth, honor, live
better now then ever, are Lords where you come; and you add misery to misery,
and affliction to affliction: Is this justice or malice? Has God judged twice?
And why will you not submit to his judgment? Why will you take it out of Gods
hand? Does not God know how to do it? Is he not severe enough? You say he is
severe: Does he want wisdom to secure himself and his people? He knows not
how to make all sure, you must mend it: When did God chasten or judge man, and
then give him to men to chasten again? Or when did Gods people fall upon
punishing after God had done it? Is God weary of afflicting, and repents him of
the evil, or remiss in executing his judgment, that you would have men take
it into their hands? Know, foolish men, your plea is your condemnation, and
what you bring as your strength, shows your rebellion and unsubjection to the
judgment of God

Secondly, You argue, page 24. No remorse appearing proportionable to the
offense; if that could be seen, you should regard it with a proportionable
tenderness toward him. Herein you destroy and deny that free mercy of God,
upon which you have lived a long while; and manifest that your profession of
the Gospel was indeed but in letter, not in power; if it had, you would as
freely forgive, as God for Christ's sake forgave you: And give freely as you
have received freely. Where the love of God and the Gospel comes in power, it
transformes and changes the person into its own glory, and makes a Christian
be indeed to others, what God is to him and in him. You requiring
proportionable remorse for the offense, and then will give proportionable
regard; how legal and humane is this? God forgives and shows mercy, that men
may repent; he loves first before we can love: but you must receive good before
you can give, and will see repentance before grace, and that in the severest
way of merit: Such sure will be the way of God to you, yea, such it, is, and
your hearts are dry and utterly void of the riches of divine mercy; and you
live upon your works, duties, experience, victories, and such empty husks,
and not upon the love of God; or else you would not bring forth such wretched,
harsh, flinty stuff as this is.

Then you say, There is no change of heart, no repentance, no free, nor full
yiedling to all the parts of public and religious interest: you know not the
heart, nor can you judge of the Kings principles; they are too high for you,
you know not your own hearts, and therefore not his: you expect he should
turn, not to God, but to your form of religion and government; and cannot
count any thing a change, but yiedling to your way; which if he should, he
should but be seven times more the Child of the Devil.

It Is true, the King hardly parts with his right, and unwilling to commit the
government wholly into others hands; but he has done it, though in weakness
and darkness, in a smoke: but for you to quench this smoking flax, is not the
spirit of Christ; he is in a doubting condition, 'tweene willingness to yield,
and a fear of wronging himself, his posterity, and others by his grants; it is
a hard case, and deserves bowels of pity, and is pitied by the bowels of the
mercy of God, though you deal harshly with him. Its a hard thing to part with
honor and greatness; its easier far to seek and get it then leave it: and if
you could remember how God got ground in our hearts when he came to change us;
how we disputed every inch, and never yielded to the Lord but by constraint,
you would accept of the Kings compliance: But remember, the same measure, etc.
you will have occasion, ere long, to think of this with horror.

Thirdly, You argue against the accommodation, because now there is no equal
balance of affairs, page 24. Your meaning is, as you often express, the
Kings forces are wholly subdued; he is in your power, and now to restore him to
a state of equality to your selves, making your selves level with him.

To all men yet; what you make an argument of severity and justice, has been
an argument of mercy: noble enemies require no more, but to get their enemies
into their power, then they show mercy, It Is Elisha's reason concerning the
Syrians, Would thou smite those that thou have taken captive, with the sword
and with the born; set bread before them that they may eat and return to
their master. This way likewise the Father of mercies uses and has used to you
and us, never bringing us down, but that he might restore us and lift us up
again. And all noble creatures, both man and beast, have this part of the
majesty of God in them, to spare them they have subdued; only Devils get into
their hands that they might torment.

A fourth reason is, That he often caused war to maintain his interest
against the public interest, this constantly and unweariedly. We must note
this by the way in proposing such an interest as you hold forth, to be the
ground of the quarrel: you lie grossly: for these things, as you propose
them, were never thought on in the beginning of the quarrel; yea, the
Parliament and we always professed the contrary, etc. never to alter the
government; never to change the fundamental laws; yea, to protect and defend
the Kings person: therefore the case now stated by you is much different from
what it was; yea, these principles, you were lately not only ignorant of them,
but opposd them, when held forth by the Levellers; and are indeed but the dust
or shivers of a split or broken Kingdom that you and they have gathered
together to build your selves a nest with, and taken up now in design only to
attain your end, malice, ambition and revenge.

But your proposing this as that against which the King made war, you do the
most justify the King that ever arty one did or can do; for your present
form of government is such a headless monster, such a hoddy-doddy, such an
all-breech, so different from the majesty of God, and the wifedome of men, that
it would fright solid and serious men to their arms: if I should fight against
any thing I should fight against this. And does not your present practice
confirm the King and his party in their way of war, when they now see
clearly, what before we conceald, that the life of the King and his posterity
is aimd at: If there be any reason for a Prince to take up arms against his
subjects, this is, when men attempt to destroy the King, and overthrow the very
foundations of government: It Is true, for a Prince to strip himself wholly of
all his dominion and royalty in love to his subjects, and to cure and recover
their rebellions, is Christ-like; and the Lord will enable the King to make a
full resignation of all, and of Fife too, into the hands of God; and when he
shall do it, it will be his ease and deliverance: And what the Lord requires
in light and mercy, you require in darkness and malice; For the Lord takes
away that he may restore again; and the King shall by loosing save all; by
parting, with his power unto God in dark and cruel men, shall receive it
again into the life and glory of God.

You come, page 26. to the second part of the question, and a second reason
against accommodation, The safety of this agreement.

Let us consider what you would have secured, and that is expressed in your
Remonstrance, That the King has forfeited all his power into your hands; That
the people are free to make the best advantages: And page 27. Having him and
his party captivated, and in their power; and sometimes you speak, conquest;
which shows, that we have gotten all the King has; we have, by war, gotten
advantage of power, honor, etc. And this is in danger now to be given away and
lost by a Treaty; We see murder will out; what has been whispered in a
corner, is come to be told upon the house top: We have all this while, to
justify our selves in this war, said, that our war was but defensive; and
indeed if it prove otherwise, we must repent of it, and bear the shame of it;
and now the truth shall come forth, I must deal plainly with you and my self;
indeed its so gross in your writing, that it was not only defensive, but
offensive, that it cannot be conceald; and that we had designs of particular
interest and advantage: When we began the war there was this in our minds, and
has been in our minds continually, That the King and his party were wicked
men, and not worthy or fit for their places and power they had; and that we
were Saints, godly, and they did properly belong to us: That the Saints are to
have the high places in the earth, and now was the time for these things to be
performed, and no body is now fit to administer justice, to rule over men, but
we: Therefore we always were glad of any of the Kings ways that tended to
difference and breach: glad when he left his Parliament and took arms,
thinking that he was running to his destruction, and that he would split
himself and his party by it, and we should have the spoil of them, and an
opportunity to obtain our ends; and though we complain now of the Kings
obstinacy, really we have been always glad of it, because it led to his
destruction, and consequently to our advantage; and the King not yiedling, you
know, now at this time was thirsted after, and you would not stir till he
manifested a yiedling mind to accommodation, or peace; being always held
destructive to our end, or the recovery of our right (the whole Kingdom) for
we think our selves the only true Lords: except the King would take part with
us, and become one of our Saints, and so we should share with him. But wow God
manifests that you are not Saints, but as weak men as others, as fooilsh,
oppressing as others, if not worse: that you are not in a condition of reigning
yet he is pleased to blast your honor and keep you low; and has so ordered it,
that a Treaty is on foot to settle things and you are left out, are likely to
lose those places which you and your riend: have, and not to attain those
golden days you hoped to see: you find fancies of reigning to be but a dream
that you must come down again from that you have gotten, and hoped to get; so
your outward and fleshly glory is dying, lies a bleeding in this miserable
inconvenience of a Treaty; this insnaring Treaty; when you and your friends in
the House and abroad, shall have your hearts ripped up to you, you will say this
is truth; and this is the reason that you seek security, something to uphold
your tottering Kingdom: Now to part with this is death to you, and you call it
a preposterous and self-deserting way, page 27. Now consider this.

First, you have by this woefully defiled your cause and manifest you undertook
the war for advantage; though it may be you were such strangers to your own
hearts, as not to know it: But their is more evil in you then yet you
understand, and it will break forth in your life. If the war had been only
defensive, you would have rested quietly, when much more is offered then we
ever had.

Secondly, that you count all your own because you have fought for it; the
Kingdom and glory of it is but enough to reward you for your works; that you
have right to all, it is yours, and your parties, and this makes you often
express the Kings title by conquest; indeed you would enforce him to hold by
it, though he never mentiond it; because its your present claim, you count your
selves conquerours; which is a brutish thing, and by it you would extinguish
civility, contract, religion, humane nature, law, and all the obligations of
them to bring in your title, force: Beastly War: That you will lose nothing,
but keep what you have got, and would by war and force secure what by force
you have won; and therefore call self-deserting (all one with self-deniing, or
self-forsaking) preposterous

Now then to conclude this, you are not Saints yet; Saints will not seek a
Kingdom by the destruction of others, nor rejoice in the evil of others,
either sin or punishment; not in others fall, that they may rise; not advance
themselves by an Army composd of ungodly men; not by force, but love: Yet it is
true, Saints shall reign notwithstanding, and those will prove Saints before
you, that you little think for; God will provoke you by a foolish people. Know
too, that Saints rights are secure in heaven, and need not beg security of
men; I scorn that cause that is subject to ruin and destruction; and
therefore your fears and sad expressions of danger impending, shows your
foundation to be upon the sands; I laugh at your destruction, and mock when
your fear comes: You live in God, stand for God, and the Gospel of God, and
talking of ruin and destruction; base is that way, and accursed, that is
subject to such black thoughts; our cause is immortal, it is eternal, it lives
and triumphs in death, is gain in loss, destruction is far from us, we know
it not: But sit under our own Vine and Fig tree, and none makes us afraid.

Another thing in danger, is, persons engaged, the party adhering; you harp
often upon this string, page 28, 29. four or five times; you think the King
will be revenged of you for your eminent activity against him: This discovers a
base and poor spirit, and unbecoming Christian soldiers, to continue war,
break off peace, design the ruin of the King and his family, subvert the
whole government of the Kingdom to secure your own lives; and this, I know,
is one maine reason of your present activity, and others are but assumed and
pretended to cover this; a Principle very destructive to a Kingdoms peace, and
contrary to the spirit of Christ; fear, a snare and the pit have taken hold of
you, that are forced t o continue the disturbance of a nation, and all the
miseries of war upon us to save your selves: Let us suppose your fears (and
the fears of those that are called honest men, for this is a general
distemper) to be demonstrations, as doubtless to you they are, and that indeed
the King should pick out a dozen, or twenty, or more, to suffer; what then,
suppose I were one of them, I account thus.

I have victory over death, and death is swallowed up by victory, and therefore
cannot fear it, am free from it, death cannot hurt me, I sport with it, am
above his reach; I live an immortal life, and cannot see death; and he that
has not this freedom is a slave.

Secondly, I have no life but truth, and if truth be advanced by suffering,
then my life also; if truth live, I live; if justice live, I live; and these
cannot dye, but by any man's suffering are enlarged, enthroned; and so I am
enlarged: If I, or any other, have a life distinct from truth, its a lie; if
distinct from justice, its unjust.

Thirdly, My life is a common life; I live with you and in you, I can confess
you and all have a right to it; if you come for it, take it; if I had a life
separated from you I would lay it down for my brethren, and I ought to do it;
that I might live with you, and you with me; and I would spoil principalities
and powers by this cross; If the King should come to take it, I would so
freely yield, that he could not but yield to that love that can dye for him;
and so hold forth a true immortal power that is too strong for earthly and
fleshly oppositions; or if any should seek my life, I would be content to give
it, that I might live again in their souls: And this is the way of the
Gospel to overcome Tyrants, and no other way, and to gain Kingdoms indeed.

Fourthly, I count it not an honest life that needs such force with so much
misery to the Kingdom, to maintain it; but on the other side I am engaged to
dye for my Country, and I shall more advantage the cause of liberty and
religion by one single suffering that is pure, then we have done by all the
blood that has been shed in this rude way of war; and lay a better and
stronger foundation against tyranny and error, then all these wars; I judge
it ten times more honorable for a single person, in witnessing truth to oppose
the world in its power, wisdom and authority, standing in its full strength,
and that nakedly and singly, then fighting many battles by army force; this Is
brutish, common, the other Christian, divine, holy, excellent; and therefore
your great care of securing your selves, comes from a slavish fear of death,
from an unwillingnesse to suffer, and want of the power of godliness to meet
the power of the world with, and true and heavenly love to your Country: you
know not that command, Ephesians. 5.2. Walk in love as Christ also has loved us,
and has given himself a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor: If you
had this perfect love it would cast out fear; if your life were indeed united
to God, or Christ were your life, or that you loved others so as you could dye
for them, you would not not now be to seek for security: It Is your great fear,
and expressed page 38. you may be made a sacrifice: That which is proposed to
you by God, upon the example of Christ is abhord by you. If Christ had been led
by this principle when he saw his enemies engaged against him to seek his
life, to have sought their life to secure his own, he had not showed himself
to be the Son of God: and you in this, declare your selves not to be the
Sons of God: It Is no justice, less piety, to take away another life to save
our own; that is the way of God to lay down his life for others: and that's a
wicked life that requires other men's lives to maintain it, that cannot stand
but by others fall.

Now let us consider the reasons of the insecurity of the public interest in
this accommodation; you give many, and may give many more, considering how much
wrath God has let out upon the world and all parts of it to destroy it; it is
the easiest thing now that can be to find out ways of ruin; but hard to
find ways of peace: and though we must confess you very quick-sighted in
discovering of dangers, and very sensible of evil, yet we will not admire it as
any excellent piece of policy, but judge it as the effect of a fearful and
self-condemning spirit.

In the first place, you fall down into the observation of past times, and
challenge story for an instance etc. page 27. There is, I know, a good use of
story; but in you, it is a dull and heterogene ous thing; and a looking back for
strength, declining your own principles which you have professed; new light,
the Kingdom of Christ, to be carried on by the Spirit and power of God; and
those things will not, you know; subject themselves to the weakness and
darkness of former ages: you know you have a light of truth and justice that no
age can parallel; that your ways are beyond all example: why do you then
disturb the dead, and challenge them to testify in these affairs that they are
ignorant of? Or why do you seek the living amongst the dead, and depart from
the living God to dead Idols to relieve you?

Then you bring forth many evil surmisings, as how apt Princes are to break
such accommodations, and how easy it is for them; page 29. and in proving these,
you are as a bird wandering from her nest, you have forgotten your resting
place, and being in a dark wilderness, you are pursued by fear and wrath on
every side; I will not follow you in you wanderings; but give you sight of your
condition in these few observations.

First, You look upon all past passages and present actions in this Kingdom,
in the darkness of man, not in the light of God; in the weakness, instability
and unfaithfulness of wicked man; not in the strength, stability and
faithfulness of a righteous God.

If you would see the peace of God in this agreement (though covered with rags)
you would rejoice in it and bless it; and if you saw God bringing down wicked
powers, and preventing of them in an evil course, you would rest in the work
of the Lord, and know God that has done it is faithful, and will do it still.
If you saw the justice of God against tyranny and oppression, you would know
that, justice is eternal and will for ever secure us: or if you saw God give us
these concessions and grants from the King; God disposing his heart by fear or
love, and could say it is the Lord that does it, you might think he will
continue them to us, or if he take them away it is to give us better: If you did
see the heart of the King is in the hand of the Lord, and it is by him he yields
to what he yields; you would rest in it, that the same hand will cause him to
do more: or if you saw God has taken the King into his power, and so the
whole Nation; that God has taken his great Reign, the power of God is come
forth to sway the Scepter, then you would conclude that Satan shall not
misleade the King to be treacherous and false to us: But you behold things as
they are in the wicked one, and there you find nothing but curses, fears,
troubles; and it is best for you that you might by that be led to the Lord: But
for the present you see things only in a carnal eye, and not with a
spiritual, and so with an evil eye, which is the reason you cannot see your
rock, the goodness of God.

Secondly, You do declare, by your fears, and expressly by words, that those
things that the Parliament now obtains of the King, in the way you behold them,
that they are forced things, not natural, but violent, and so not durable:
that they are unjust and oppressing, and so not lasting: for if you could look
upon them as natural, or right and just, you had reason to think they were
lasting; for God is the protector of just things, and stand firm against all
the power of hell; and if they were so in you and them, or as far as they are
so, all things that appear against them will be dashed in pieces, Justice being
an invincible Rock: but you are extreme sensible of their going back again to
the King from whence they came; and returning to their original.

If you did indeed believe that the original of power were in the People,
these grants would rest with you; and if there be any more behind, you might
be persuaded they would freely follow these you have already, for things
naturally or by the appointment of God run to their center. But it seems you
find no peace in these, and complain of the danger you are in of losing of
them, which shows those things have no good bottom or foundation in you: And
know this, that these violent courses that you are upon, of disclaiming and
renouncing all dependence on the King, or accord with him, and an utter
rejection, expulsion and deposure either of his whole race, and all that claim
it upon the same account of right; or at least of his particular Person, and
execution of justice upon him, page 28. will not secure what you have got; but
rather it is the way to lose them, and set up Princes in a higher way then
ever: for all things being by force, compelled from their nature, that force
being removed, they return with the greater earnestness: and nothing that is
violent can be perpetual: Besides, He that will save his life shall lose it:
especially when it is going, and men use wicked ways to uphold their tottering
state, then it goes, as we say, with a vengeance; and that is your condition:
God says in your hearts and consciences, your standing is corrupt and ungodly,
and he has a quarrel against it, and it must fall: The rumor of your fall (In
respect of your present greatness) sounds in your bosoms, and it is that
which puts you upon these courses to save your selves, which will hasten your
fall.

Thirdly, Your deep sense that you have of the Kings recovering what he has
lost, of his getting into his seat and Throne again, and of the disposition of
the generallity of people to help him to his beloved dignity: whence you make
such total conclusions not only of probabilities of danger, but certain
insecurity, and perpetual prejudice to publi^e interest, supposd the best
constitutions and strictest laws imaginable etc. page 47. These things do
declare that these Concessions are not long lived; and do prophecy the
restitution of the King to his ancient Rights, and give a clear testimony to
the immortality and stability of Kinglines.

You see that the King has a will to redeem his present loss: you may see it
in your own hearts, that every man has a lust after power and authority: And
you have seen it in his constant carriage. For my part I condemn his
unlawful seeking of it, and any falsehood in it, but if he should not endeavor
the maintaining: and restoring of the dignity of Kings, He were false to his
trust, and the glory and majesty of God that he is entrusted with: And
therefore that desire of recovering his loss, is justifiable in him; yea, I
should condemn him as unbelieving and weak spirited, if he should not hope
for it, and constantly aim at it: But here is his misery, and yours for the
present, that you are not acquainted with that fullness of power that is in God
to dispense, and that wisdom whereby it shall be disposd; so that he shall have
as much and more then ever he had, and you all, and more then you desire; and
that way will be showed him to confirm what you ask of him, and give you
more, and yet continue his own Royalty in the greatest abso lutenesse and
perfection: And for want of this, you are tugging and pulling the Kingdom in
pieces to satisfy your selves with dominion; whereas if you were in a right
understanding of things, there is enough in God, in the nation, to satisfy all
desires, and largeness enough for all to have what they would, without
entrenching one upon another, or maligning one another. If he desire it in a
carnal and wicked way, he shall never have it; If he commit it to the Lord,
and expect, it from him, he shall have it, and that will be his and our mercy.

It Is granted then, that he has a mind to recover, and that this is according
to his principle, and maybe managed rightly, and not to the prejudice of the
Parliament, or his opposers: And that he shall rise, yea, is now great, your
Remonstrance seals to it. You condemn the Parliament for owning him so far,
as to seek to him by a Treaty; and you by taking such pains to arm your
selves against him, make it manifest, he has a great power; which is a wonder,
that a Prince, spoild of all his authority, naked, a prisoner, destitute of all
friends and helps, wholly at the dispose of others, tied and bound with all
obligations a that a Parliament can imagine to hold him, should yet be such
terror to you, and fright you into such a large Remonstrance, and such
perilous proceedings as you are upon to save your selves from him, that is now
a worm; either you are full of fear, that are so affected with a shadow, or
else there is some strange power in him.

As you give testimony to his power, so you take a course to advance it; for
there is nothing that has any spark of God in it, but the more it is
suppresid, the more it rises; afflictions being always great improvements to
good things, which shine most when they are tried.

You speak of his reputation, page 36. The more you crush him, the sweeter
savor comes from him; and while he suffers, the Spirit of God and glory rest
upon him: There is a sweet glory sparkling in him by suffering though you see
it not: You do but rend away his corruptions from him, and help to wast his
dross, and draw forth that hidden excellency that is in him; and naturally men
are ready to pity sufferers, When nothing will gain me, affliction will; I
confess his sufferings make me a Royalist, that never cared for him: He that
does and can suffer shall have my heart; you had it while you suffered; now you
are great, and need it not; the poor, suffering, oppressed King and his party
shall have my compassion; your severe punishing him for his weakness in
government, and great abuse of government your selves, will beget in people an
high account of the King, and provoke them to greater rage against you; and
therefore you are upon foolish ways; while you, are seeking to prevent these
evils, you are running further into them; you are raising more evils against
your selves, not allaying of them: It Is the power of love binds men from hurting
you; cruelty inrages men, and will turn men into Devils against you.

Fourthly, Your speech shows what is within, Out of the abundance of the heart
the mouth speaks: A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, brings
forth good things; and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart,
brings forth evil things: no man can speak any thing but himself. It Is our
happiness to live to see the hearts of men clearly brought forth.

You tell us of the King, how probable, yea, demonstrable it is, that he will
cast off these verbal and literal confessions and concessions, and that his
yiedling for the present is but upon design to obtain the Throne, but when be
has it he will quickly break, and have colorable grounds for it: Which does
but tell us what you would do, or what is in your hearts to do: It seems you
are able to teach the King deceit, and to show him a way to escape out of all
engagements; Charity thinks no evil, because it thinks nothing but God, it
hopes all things, believes all things, because it sees God at the bottom of all
things: But you hope for nothing but deceit, falsehood and treachery, Wise to
do evil, but to do good no knowledge: You speak evil, but cannot sgeake
good; Curse you do, but bless not; you never speak any good of the King, or
any, but in scorn; and so you mention the King (Good man) So large and cunning
in discovery of ill, and void of good, shows you empty of one, and full of the
other.

Fifthly, You express a multitude of dangers ready to come upon us by this
Treaty; from the King his reputation, party their multitude, their activity,
their greatness, from abroad, from home, from the Parliament their divisions,
their burdening the people with taxes, from the force that is upon the King,
etc. Fear has taken bold of you, it en compasses you about on every side;
Like Cain, that says. Every one that meets me will kill me; you know no
safety: Can this be away of God? Does not God establish our goings, and set our
feet upon a rock, and make us able to lie down and sleep in a wilderness,
and not be afraid? We know none can hurt us, having Salvation for walls and
bulwarks, and can and do live in the face of hell, death, Devils, and not be
disturbed, yea, seek no other protection then the arm of God.

They are the sinners in Sion that are afraid; We that are the people of God,
dwell in that mountain where there is no hurtful thing; Our City gates stand
open night and day, and we fear no surprises, no designs can betray us; we
are not troubled to shut our gates to keep out death, evil flies from us; we
need no black designs against our enemies to save our selves, we do declare
against all that walk in a way contrary to this; That their wisdom is not from
above, not pure, so not peaceable, but is earthly, carnally sensual and
devilish. In this perplexed state you are in, is seen your judgment is begun;
you have left God, and he has left you to these tormenting fears; this is the
wrath that was threatened upon you; you are seeking selfesafety, it is your
business; therefore you uphold your Army to preserve the lives of the godly
party, and safety flies from you: God looks every way upon you with sadness
and wrath; it is your wickedness to think of, or speak of safety in a worldly
state; you have been taught otherwise, and know, you shall never have it; you
think you may use the means, no, all means are wicked that have an end
contrary to the revealed will of God; and this has been told your hearts,
that there is no peace but in God. This is a general distemper, and that which
your friends are guilty of extremely, but It Is the spirit of hondage to fear,
and not of love and a sound mind. This passion sets you on work, and therefore
your business must needs be base and vile; to act for ones self in any kind,
is evil and un-christian; but to aft for selfesafety is so mean and poor a
thing, as it must needs produce most vile and absurd actions: It is of all
affections the unworthiest; a deep pit, and causes black, horrid and foul
things: I Will show you a little that rest and peace which we enjoy; that
security which you have turned your backs upon, in refusing the Lord, and for
want of it are groping in these dark waves of yours.

First, I fear no party nor interest because I love all, I am reconciled to
all, and all are reconciled to me; I have enmity to none but the son of
perdition; I oppose nothing but destruction, and therefore nothing opposes me:
It Is enmity begets insecurity; and while men live in the flesh, and in enmity to
any party or interest, in a privace, divided and self good, there will be
perpetual wars and strife; except that particular should quite ruin all other
parts, and live alone, which the universal must not, will not suffer, for the
admitting a part to eat up and devour others, were to destroy the whole,
which is God; and such a mind in any part does not only fight with another
part, but against the whole; and so every faction of men striving to make
themselves absolute, do directly war against God, who is love, peace, and a
general good, gives being to all, and cherishes all; and therefore in such,
opposition of fellow members, and of God, the God of peace and union, there can
be no peace nor securicy: But we being enlarged into the largeness of God, and
comprehending all things in our bosoms by the divine spirit, are at rest with
all, and delight in all, for we know nothing but what is in our hearts; Kings,
Nobles are much beloved because they are in us, of us, one with us, we being
Kings and Lords by the anointing of God.

Secondly, We inherit all things, having overcome; we are free the Sons of God,
and all things are given unto us, are our own for our use: the greatest as
well as the least; and therefore fear nothing, being Lords of all: To be in a
state apprehensive of danger is to be a servant; and while servants are
quarrelling one with another, beating one another, their Lord is absent, and
they are in danger one of another.

This is the condition of all the world, and of you in the Army, and therefore
are far from Lordship, true spiritual reigning; yea, hell, deaths
destruction it self is ours, and does us service: In our great houses there
are vessels of honor and of dishonor; both useful and profitable; Captivity
is become our captive; death is become life; confusion has its beauty, they
are all excellent, as we in our house dispose of them and enjoy them; our
interest is public, extends to all, and all are our interest.

Thirdly, We live in heaven, peace is in our walls, and plenty, in our palaces;
that word is performed to us, They shall see evil no more; we know no evil
in our Paradise, not eating of the forbidden fruit; all is good, in all we see
a smiling, bright, sweet face of majesty; We live upon Mount Zion, and it is
large enough to receive our souls, bodies, estates, lives, families, all is
taken within the Gates of the Holy City, and this City reaches all over the
earth: Here we enjoy all things, all persons, all actions, we never go out of
it, but live in the peace and safety of it continually: And here there is no
more curse, nor death, sorrow and sighing flee from us; God wipes all tears
from our eyes, and enjoying this, and all in this, in truth and power; we need
no defense, no safety but our own rock. Our house which is from heaven.

Fourthly, I fear nothing in the world, because Greater is he that is in us,
then he that is in the world; I have overcome the world, it is at my feet, I
trample upon it; If you find any world in me, you shall do me right to
afflict it, break it; Let it suffer, it is righteous it should, I would have no
worldly thing that lives out of God have rest, its against my life and
principle; and by this I do overcome it, and shall never be troubled for the
loss of it, for I would have no inheritance, no life or being but in the
eternal world: The world, I know, it is a poor shadow, a fading thing, and is
only terrible in the dark, there is nothing in it, but it is more excellently
and mightily in us in God; Men, Kings, Emperors, as they are in an earthly
state, we know they are worms that shall dye, mortals, and trouble they may
themselves, not us; They are not worthy of a caution to them that live above
them, or take heed: Have they power: so have we everlasting power, and either
theirs is one with ours, or infinitely short of it: you show your selves weak
and under them when you fear them. Have they policy, wisdom, we have
treasures; either theirs is ours, or else we can make fools of them; if they
act not in our light, we are, and can, when we will, go beyond them; they are
filly men that fear cunning, narrow pated men, that cannot secure themselves
from policy: Have they multitudes, a large and numerous party; we have more,
and they can have none but ours, all are ours, we have Legions, ten thousand
times ten thousand; They that are with us are more then they that are against
us; yea, all are for us, if they knew us and what they would have, we having
with us the desire of all nations: Would they have a King, they are in the
dark; but we know they truly can desire none but our King, etc. and if you
doubt and fear, you are solitary and alone, a widow, not married to God and his
innumerable hosts: Of all things we would not fear men because they are wicked,
false, breakers of Covenant, perfidious, etc. This is to set up wickedness by
a Law; to accuse God, that the wicked go unpunished, that it is in vain to
serve him, that he is not just; it is to offer the highest honor to the basest
creatures, men in wickedness; We know they work in that fire that will destroy
them: if men be evil they cannot hurt me but as they hurt themselves; they are
hastening to their own destruction, they carry their ruin with them: besides,
we know such men are in hell, and there chain them: though Kings; we can, by
the power of God, bind them in chains of Iron: have power to bind the devil
and cast him into the bottomless pit: We assure you, that the devil shall not
appear in any form or persons, be they never so great, never so gifted, never
so glorious in religion or power, be it in you or any other, but we will deal
with him, cast loads of wrath upon him, and fill him with torment; cast him from
his heaven of outward religion or power, and secure him within his own bounds,
that he shall no longer destroy the earth: We do and will dissolve his works be
they never so wisely contrived, Set our feet upon him, and tread upon this Lion
and Adder, and he shall not hurt us.

Therefore you, while you tell us or your great fears, and demonstrate certain
certain insecurity, and travel to bring forth your sense of danger, you and the
godly party are in; you think you are wise men, must act as rational men for
your safety, and judge us fools, mad men, that if you should do as we, the
whole Christian cause would fall to the ground, and all would be lost; We will
lay this upon you, Rev: 21.8. The fearful and unbelieving etc, have their part
in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death:
you are in a lake of sire, work in the fire, and this is of the Lord, it is
the just judgment of God upon you; not of men, but of and by the Lord; you are
beyond the reach of men, but are reserved to be punished, from the presence of
the Lord, This is your second death; you were dead in sins, are quickened by
repentance, but are gone back; the life of grace and Religion is dead in you,
and you that escaped the first, are fallen into a second death: But one word
more answering to this, Revelations 22.15. Without are dogs: you are acting
all along without the City: yea, professedly setting up a power that is in the
world at distance from and out of God; which you call highest power on earth,
created, standing power on earth; and for that power that divinity has
designed, you laugh at it; and you know your wholl trade is now driven in the
world as distinct from heavenly things, though you would cover it too with a
sheeps skin, and cry it is the Lord, the Lord with us: but you are cast out, and
gone out, and live out of the blessed and glorious presence of God, and so are
dogs rated by God into a filthy kennel of base things; and are fearful as dogs:
God has beaten you by the King, and kept you under, and you are fearful of the
same hand still, and think 'twill be worse yet, we shall suffer again; and that
sets you a barking out your wrathful angry and feirce stuff. If you were with
your Father in his presence as Sons, these clamours would cease, and you
would be above all, and do good to all, and bless all as your Father does.

This is a main groundwork of your whole business; that law of nature which
teaches men to save themselves, and therefore we have taken the more pains to
discover the rottenness of it, and how you decline God and grace to fly to
depraved and corrupt nature to be your guide and God; and to the poor and
basest principle of nature, self-preservation, which must lead to the
unworthiest things; and for professed Christians to act so low, is great
wickedness and a curse.

You do in this discourse meet with two objections.

First, Your own former declaring for the King, which seems a little to trouble
you; but you with some difficulty scramble over it; and I think in that spirit
that you are in will stand at nothing: we will only say this, that by breaking
those Proposals, you justify all the breach of promise in the King or any
others, and do, not only break the command, but teach men to do so; for upon
the principles of your apology for your selves, every man is free from all
engagements whatsoever.

As first, you say, page. 43. concerning your compliance with the King, Partly
necessitating us for the present prevention of that mischief to the public
they were running into in that kind as we apprehended: we were drawn into etc.
if men for necessity, and to avoid public danger, say a thing though he
perform it not, there is no great evil in it.

Secondly, That moderation was but Hypotheticall; That is no such engagements
are absolute, but conditional, nor to be observed, but saving the Public
interest; Now we being judges of what is safe for the public interest, can
deliver our selves when we please; which is the Pharisees law, If a man say it
is Corban, its a gift, shall be free.

Thirdly, We aimd not at the strengthening our selves to the ruin of any
persons, but to prevent, etc. So that there be honest intentions, we may step
over these outward bonds; and wisely to prevent mischief, break all relations,
trample upon all authority. And afterward you repent, and say, 'Twas error,
frailty, unbelief and carnal counsels, page 44. And page 52. you fall upon it
again, and there you say were led to it by the Parliaments course: and now God
has opened your eyes, and let you see beyond what you did before.

How excellently do you teach men to go from what they have said; if they see
further and can repent it, they are free: See how abominable religion is when
once corrupted: There Is no kind of men can be such complete and neat knaves, as
a Jesuit, a Pharisee, an old well studied professor of Religion; when once
men's consciences are defiled, and they begin to trade in the world, with a
pretense that it is for God, they are so cunning, that no bonds of honesty or
faith can possibly hold them.

This business of your repentings concerning your former compliance with the
King, is a great strength to you, and you much build upon it: You have seen
your sin, you say, and been humbled for it, and sought God, and are clean
from it, you have been troubled, but now are at peace: Alas poor men! A
deceived heart has turned you aside, and you see not the lie in your right
hand; This your Righteousness is a broken bow that starts aside; A broken
reed, that while you lean upon it, will pierce your hand. To shame you for the
iniquity of holy things, and show the abomination even of your Reformation,
Know this from him who knows your ways and hearts.

First, That it was not your sin to carry out principles of tenderness and
goodness to all, and of fair and gentle dealing toward enemies, as you
formerly did in your proposals: but to do this falsely and hypocritically, to
take these Lambe-like proposals to cover a Ravening Wolf; or to assume them,
not out of love to them, but to gain reputation; or to gull and cheat a party
into a quiet waiting upon you for deliverance, till you had gaind your end, and
then deceive them, and wholly relinguish them, this is your sin; And this you
were by me admonished of concerning the King, that if you did look toward
him, you should nakedly and freely discover your hearts and bosoms to him; if
he did so close with you, it might be well; but that you should not (as you did)
in distrust of God, falsely, without judgment accept of him and agree with him,
that was declared to you to be evil, and a daubing with untempered mortar.

Secondly, In your turning now you turn not to God; God says to you, You do
not at all fast to me, but you are an empty vine bringing forth fruit to your
selves: For this present expedition, though you are blind and see it not, is
merely for and to your selves; And there are in you the same wickedness that
was in the former, and worse; frailty is now malice; unbelief turned to
self-confidence; carnal counsel into devilish counsel: There is nothing more
of the glory of God in you now, but less; yea, That which you seemed then to
have is taken from you; your wisdom, mercy, moderation, etc. So you turn not
from the iniquity of your way; not from this in hypocirsy, to this in truth, in
righteousness; but from a vain proposal of good to acting evil, you turn
indeed, but to Egypt, you are gone from good in show, to evil in substance.

Thirdly, The root of this work you have in hand is a sense of the loss of
Gods favor; you have felt Gods frowns upon you, and that has put you upon
this work, to recover your lost splendor, and to make satisfaction.

This is a miserable, dark principle, and begets very wicked practices: in a
sense of the wrath of God to seek for means to expiate his displeasure: Esavs
tears, Saul's sacrificing, Isreal's offering up the first borne of their bodies
for the sin of their souls: Poor blinded men! when they seek to satisfy
God, run more in wickedness against him: he that goes upon such grounds to
satisfy an angry God, and to quiet a fearful and guilty conscience, will
always be bloody and cruel, and are thrust on commonly to some eminent folly,
some notorious and absurd wickedness, and so are you, not being established in
the love of God, nor walking in a plain path of righteousness, but blinded in
wrath, are hurried from one extreme to another: This cursed giddiness of flesh
to do evil, and think they do God good service, is the fruit of apostasy,
and quenching the spirit of God; to be so left to your selves, that which way
soever you go, you commit iniquity, and not able to know or practice the
truth; you are in this the greatest examples of divine justice that this age
has brought forth.

The second thing that lies in your way, is the Covenant, which obliges to the
preservation of the Kings person and authority, page 54. but not so strongly,
but the snare is broken, and you have an honest way to escape; Many things you
bring to quit your selves from it; that clause, In the preservation of the true
Religion and liberty of the Kingdom, page 55. If it have an evil sense it
calls for repentance, page 57. This however will never fail, repentance knows
how to wash away any Covenant. Then you plead, 'twas 'twixt man and man, and
would exclude the King, as not present nor consenting, pap. 58. and after would
exclude God from being any thing but a witness, page 50. You would have God
have as little interest in it as you can: It Is a very ill temper of mind that
lessens the interest of God in our affairs: Its an ill tongue that is an
orator for man, and denies God; that says God is but thus: It Is no dishonor
to the King to be left out, where God is not admitted to be a party, only a
looker on: But God says, What you did to one of these little ones, you did to
me: You vowed to me in the King, though a little one, imprisoned, sick, naked;
yet your oath was to me.

God says, I put in the preservation of the Kings life and authority into the
Covenant, into all your oaths and protestations, on purpose to save him after
all his sufferings for sin: And observance is due to me; I was in that
Covenant, and will punish the breakers: Where are you now?

Concerning your breaking this Covenant in a thing so express, so agreeable to
all the Parliaments Declarations and Remonstrances, we will lay down these
three considerations.

First, That Oaths and Covenants, the maine pillars of humane society, the
greatest determiners of controversies, the chief part of divine worship, is in
this age most commonly violated, and impudently profaned: Poor world! what
will you do? Thy great security from danger, Oaths, thy Physician that has
cured thy breaches often, and heald distempers, is become ineffectuall: There
is such wickedness amongst us, and that crept into the best of men, and under
such pretenses of piety to God, that no Covenants will hold them: Certainly if
God does not manifest, a new and everlasting Covenant to compose and bind us
together, we shall live in a wilderness of horrid confusion.

Secondly, That these are the last and perilous times spoken of, 2 Timothy 3.1.
etc. And that you, amongst others, are the people there spoken of, Lovers of
themselves; That Is your fundamental Law, selfepreservation, and the ground of
your present actings, to intrude your selves into the worlds greatness, out of
a high opinion of your own deserts, thinking your selves only wise, just,
holy, honorable, etc.

I could show you the other particulars, and may in time apply the Text to you,
if you repent not; but for the present occasion, it is said, there they shall be
Truce Breakers, (...), against accommodation, no treaty, no agreement: Or
breakers of Covenant, and then it follows, (...), Accusers, and at this you
are exquisite.

Thirdly, That Covenants being the strength of humane societies, and so great
bulwarks of the world, degenerated or apostasied Religion is the great engine
of Gods wrath appointed to break them down: Solemn Oaths and Covenants are
able to hold most men's consciences, but men heightened by Religion into the
forms of the spirit, doing things by immediate direction from God, carrying a
glorious presence of God before them, affirming that they are called by God to
do some special work in the world: these can easily mount above the highest
forts of Oaths, and trample them under foot presently: Men that have tasted of
these high things, and begin to make them serviceable to worldly ends, they are
such cunning pick-locks, that they can find a way through all doors to come to
the treasures of power and authority: A people that have had a savor of
heavenly things in a fleshly way: turn them loose into the world, and they will
tear it up by the roots; they are whetted for destructions such as are spoken
of, Ezekiel. 21.31. Brutish men, skillful to destroy: such wicked spirits are now
abroad, that are brutish, spare not the holiest nor honourablest things: Kings,
Lords, Ministers, Scriptures, Ordinances, Oaths, Covenants lay all waste; and
yet in the greatest brutishinesse, skillful, though there be the most sensual
and beastly confusion, yet they shall do it artificially, skilfully, say it is
for God, justice, religion, etc. and that they do it by the power of Christ,
and the spirit of God, in religious zeal, etc. and so exact, that they will
not be known from builders, restorers, reformers. But the holy, good, wise,
merciful spirit of the living God, the Father of mercies, will in his own
light condemn this unclean spirit, and drive him out of the land.

Having cleared your way to what you have to propose you give us your
apprehensions of the remedy, page 60. your first is to, lay aside this evil and
dangerous Treaty: This is a strange remedy against civil wars, to lay aside
treating: Then you require that the Kings demands be rejected, especially that
of his restitution to London; This is very terrible to you that the King should
recover any strength; no, keep him down as long as you can, let him not rise:
how far is this from the power of godliness, oracting in the power of God: a
poor pusillanimous, cowardly, worldly policy: you dare not think of the King
getting any power, for then you know you durst not deal with him; not barely
in the power of God: but he a prisoner and you free; having an Army at your
command, you dare accuse him; if he were in power, you would shrink out of the
Kingdom; whereas if you lived in the power of God, you might trample upon
Thrones; if he were wicked pull him from his greatest glory, and bind him in
chains.

Secondly, you would have that bargaining proposition laid aside, and would
have all justice done immediately, from the judicial power of the Kingdom the
Parliament, and not by grant from the King: you do the King a courtesy in
that: and this being done, you wish moderation and mercy; not as long as there
be any apprehension of fear* there is little mercy from fearful enemies: mercy
is in Breasts that are strong and mighty. But page 62. you come to the marrow
of the business, to propound high things that sha1l reach us peace with God,
and quiet amongst men: There was never such a mocking of God since the world
stood: for men that have professed Christ our peace so long as you have done,
should now tall from that atonement (which you only talked of, had not in
power) to offer up to God the blood of men, the blood of men already in
affliction, the blood of their enemies, and that upon such principles to secure
themselves, to obtain and keep self-advantages; it is such a sacrifice as was
never yet by the darkest heathens invented: if you had covertly sought revenge
upon him, etc. you had had some equals and examples for your fact; but to do
the same thing (in fear and revenge to remove an adversary) and boldly,
impudently, to bring it to God as a sacrifice to appease his displeasure, and
expiate sin, is an unparalleled wickedness: and a project as foolishly contrived,
to quiet the people by taking away a Prince beloved of his people, indeer'd to
them by his sufferings; whose government (though full of weakness) was far better
then those that succed him; a Prince, strong in the affection of his Subjects,
and forain alliance, and then when he is in a yielding way to peace, to give
satisfaction to his Subjects, yea, when he is upon an agreement, then to seek
the removal of him by death, or deposure against the desires of the body of
the Kingdom, and of their representatives in Parliament; upon the foul and
black designs of a few unbelieving people, that this should be a way to quiet
the Kingdom it is as far from policy as the other is from piety.

But to your Proposals; first, you propound, That that capital and grand
author of our troubles, the Person of the King, may be brought to justice for
the treason, blood, etc. Two things we will consider.

First, Your Justice.

Secondly, The person upon whom it is to be administered.

First, It Is not justice that you desire, it appears so to your blind and
deceived hearts; but in the face of God it appears far otherwise: To tell you
that justice must be done by law, and that no law takes hold of the King, will
not convince you, though to others it will manifest that; you that pretend to
contend for the laws, are the greatest violaters of them. But the searcher of
hearts will deal otherwise with you, and show you what is within you, and
discover the falsehood and injustice of your spirits.

First, Know this (for you have felt it) that God has a controversy with you:
that though you have done many things for him, yet you are not perfect; but
there is some wicked thing to be purged out of you, which is your glorying in
that fleshly way in which you are: God has called you out of it, and you have
refused him, and sunk down deeper into it, blessing add strengthening your
selves in it; being unwilling to strip your selves naked of those carnal1 helps
and advantages that you were engaged to; or to suffer a loss of those glorious
favors that you have received, that you might have better: but loving this
present evil world, and despising the Spirit of God and refusing his safety
alone, and to rest and live under his wings abhorring to cease acting in the
flesh, and to be perfected by sufferings: You have, by this joined your selves
to the prince of darkness, departed from God to the God of this world, by
which Satan has betrayed you, spoiled all your glory; gotten those good things
God gave you, into his possession, and imployes them against the Lord, and
takes the poor people of God captive, to serve in the foul and base ways of
the world; and the Lord now comes for justice against this spiritual
wickedness in places; you have dealt against small petty corruptions and have
seen them executed; but now the devil has corrupted all your gifts and graces,
and spilt the blood of Christ, who was a babe in you, and brought great
spiritual mischiefs upon you, death, wrath, trouble, absence of God, deprived
you of your freedom with God, etc. now God calls for justice against this
destroyer of such precious beginnings of godliness, and creates trouble in
your spirit for want of it: but this cunning serpent beguiles you and sets up a
shadow of an enemy a King without, as an object to your justice, to save
himself and all his villainy from the justice of God within: Poor beguild
wretches, you are not yet acquainted with his wiles: you are turned out of the
righteous way, and will never find peace till you come to see all those evils
in your selves in truth, which are in show and shadow in the King; and when the
sword of the Spirit which cuts inwardly, is turned against those enemies of God
you will do justice indeed.

Secondly, This way of acting in you for justice, is great apostasy, for a
company of men that have been led up into such high things of God, to live in
God, and do all things in the Spirit of God; now to fall down into the way of
heathens; to lay the weight of their spirits upon so poor a thing as moral
justice, and to dance after the example, or take for their guide and rule the
blind actings of Gentiles that lived in the world without God; and only
sought an outward freedom: and to prostitute the Spirit of God to such Common
and profane things, is exceeding unworthy of the profession of a Christian,
and a going back from Canaan to Egypt.

Thirdly, Your Justice is but a bare name, or a heathen covering, borrowed from
men to hide your shame, your malice, unbelief, fear, and such like monstrous
lusts, which you know you are not free from; and though you would not see, you
shall see, and the world shall see too, that you are as other men are, and take
up the lees and dregs of the world: cunning ways to remove adversaries, to
take away those that stand in your way; and paint them over with the names of
justice, security to the public interest, and so act them in the face of the
Sun. Take but this instance; hundreds of the Kings party, the basest and
worst of them who have borne arms for the King; are yet admitted into your
Army, joined with you in engagements; because it is for your advantage end the
strengthening your selves; to let go the principal and punish inferior
instruments, say you, is not just: And so spare inferiors to serve us, and
punish great ones to secure our selves of them, it is great injustice: It is an
old deceit of justice to lay hold of small offenders, and let go the great
ones, that is gross and common: but to accept the small ones into, alliance,
favor and service because we want their bodies; and to seek the ruin of
great ones, because we would have their honors, places and estates, is a new
wickedness, a path not trodden in before; high flying and gallant cruelty,
spare rogues, slaves to do slavish work, men of no conscience, worth nor
honesty, and strike at a Prince standing for his interest engaged by conscience
and honor: This is your justice.

Now for the King, against whom you go in full cry; I have this to say to check
your violent course.

First, That he had and has a true lawful right in the Kingdom and to the
Kingdom, as good as any man has to any thing he possesses, his crown, revenue
and dignity is as righteously his birthright and inheritance as another house
or land; and he that denies this is wilfully blind.

As he has a right to his Crown and Subjects, so it is his Peoples right to
have a King, I confess it my birthright to have relation to a King, to live
under a great Monarch; and if I am denied it, I am denied my native right, and
so my pleasure of honoring and serving him, and receiving honor from him, and
many and great profits coming by him.

And he having a right to his Crown, and his People a right to him, it was as
just for him and his party to stand for their right as for any other party to
uphold theirs: It is true his interest, and Parliaments, and Peoples were all
in the dark, and none could distinctly divide one from another, or clearly
judge which is which; and so ordained by God for the fall of them as they stood
in a worldly way: It is true the King abused his interest and power, and in the
exercise of it transgressed against GOD and his People. And it is as true, when
the Parliament came to plead their right, they were to seek, and did in
contending for it sin against GOD and the King so that both have a right,
both have some reason to contend for their right, but both have erred in
maintaining their rights; And therefore the King is not free from sin alone,
nor guilty alone, nor his party: The Parliament not free alone, nor guilty
alone, but each side have some good and evil mingled together, you nor they
perfectly righteous, all have transgressed and gone out of the way; and
therefore it is pride and partiality in you to say he is guilty of all the blood,
rapine, etc. No, all are guilty; We must say, There it none righteous, no not
one: You may say he was first guilty, or most guilty, because he is first and
greatest, and so has suffered first and most: but to clear your selves as pure
only, and condemn others as guilty only, is pride and uncharitableness; and
all proceedings upon this ground, are acts of hostility, and a continued
prosecution of the old difference.

Thirdly, I say that the King in his present state is more righteous then you,
he now suffers and acts, and is in his present way the most just in the
Kingdom.

First, He has confessd his error, though you wickedly urge it against him;
and though it be in weakness, yet the Lord is tender of him in it: He has
expressly owned his sin, and the Parliament implicitly in yiedling to treat
with him, and showing a readiness to receive him to favor: It Is in their
hearts that they were rash, violent, and too captious and ready to take
advantages against the King, being spurd on by some carnal and smister ends;
and so far as they incline to acknowledge their errors, they are in a way to
pardon: Only you justify your selves as innocent, and so most or 1ast guilty.

Secondly, He has been in this Treaty in a self-denying way, in a way of
parting with his rights, though misinterpreted, b ing looked upon through
enmity and jealousyes, and you and the Parliament are upon the gaining and
securing to your selves: He is coming down, you and others are getting up: He
is falling, you rising: He is a sufferer, you inflicters of sufferings.

Thirdly, He ownes a God in the world, and appeals to him: that principle that
you disdain so much, page 47. and elsewhere, is more righteous then yours,
which are seeking to set up a dark form of Government without God; so just as
not to need God; in which we may rest, and never go further to appeal to God.
The King has appeald to God, and it has cost him dear; God has judged him
for his sins, as you say often in your Remonstrance, and it is a wonder to me
that you should fleight that maxim of impunity from man, and appealing, to God,
when God is come forth so visibly as he is, to punish all ill government: Yea,
that which you fly to your selves in your second Declaration, and the Holy God
is as righteous to you as to the King, to punish you in your kind as him in
his: And as it has been his fall, so it will be his and your rising, sticking
fast to your appeal to God in distress, he will restore him and you.

A fourth is this, That the King in his offers of peace has showed a fatherly
and large spirit, and endeavored the comprehending of all interests; and you
insist only upon your own, and others, as relating to yours.

The fifth and last thing I have to say for the King, is that which I have
already published, That he is an Image of the glory of God the Father, and
chosen by the divine majesty to bring forth it self: A vessel of honor,
pardoned, loved, and taken into union with God.

And it is not the least aggravation of your sin that you go on in your ways
against him, after the divine Grace had so publicly ownd him: And this you
do without any knowledge of the mind of God, or any ability to show the evil
and weakness of that discovery; but in a rude and brutish pursuing of your
own sense and experience: you are sunk deep into the earth, or else you
would not say (after such a manifest judgment given by God) as you do, page
48. If they claim by immediate, divine designation, let them show it, page 50.
in a way of rejecting and denying at least; Which we are sure can be no less
then something of Divinity: Indeed you cannot, nay will not see divine things
amongst men, else you would not now say, Let them show it. But of all it is the
greatest wonder that you should be such opposers of Divinity and divine
designation, who have professed God is in all, there is nothing but God, and
cry up the name of God so much to be in your own dark and confused ways, and
will not acknoeledge him in any thing that is honorable or excellent: And
though your Remonstrance be against this glory of God breaking forth in the
King, your actions shall and do promote it: and this may be your comfort, that
these sufferings will so refine and improve him, that he will appear in that
excellent spirit of love and goodness, as shall freely forgive your violence
against him, and rejoice in his sufferings, being the certain way to a true
Throne of Glory. Thus I dare meet with all your power, and interpose between
the edge of your inflamed wrath and the King; I value not what you can do or
say: If you say I am turned Royalist, I am of a Royal Seed, a Royal
Priesthood, and a lover of Royalty in the most High God, and no where else: If
you say I do it upon carnal grounds, you may say it, but shall not long think
it, but will wish your selves as free from worldly respects and selfe-seeking in
acting against, as I am in appearing for the King ere long.

The three next things propounded are but the raveling out of the same
principle; wherein you show what a reach your great fears have, and how wary
you are to fortify your selves against al from whom there may be any
appearance of danger; And so the Kings Children must suffer, and a competent
number of his chief Delinquents. There is here nothing of a new principle, and
therefore I omit it.

Your sift is, for satisfaction of Arrears: This is a main wheel, though it
makes little noise here; For I believe, if you could get your Arrears, which
are very considerable sums of money, and would help you to live
conveniently, and could rationally and upon visible grounds promise your selves
safety and a quiet life, you would be content to lay down many of you and be
quiet. This is good sober dealing, and you think it very justifiable, For the
Labourer is worthy of his hire; And you know many of you, I think the greatest
part of the body, would have left long ago, if they had not hoped to recover
some good part of their Arrears. But is this suitable to our profession when we
undertook this War? Did not we scorn a mercenary soldier, or soldier of
fortune? And upon those terms have dealt with God and men; yet now the
Kingdom must lie under misery till you have your arrears. I Will but say this to
you, you are upon as good a way to pay or acquit your Arrears as the Scots were.

Your next thing propounded is concerning the Parliament, that it should have a
Certain period, and so the great trust reposed in them may return to the
people, page 65. This Parliament has been a pretty hackney for you, you can
ride it as long as you will, and which way you will, and then turn it up:
Prescribe it what it shall do, and how long: We see now your tender regard to
the privilege of Parliament: How pitifully you use this Old Mass, as you call
it, page 45. You guard it and regard it, mould and turn this mass til it be
fit for your purpose; and when it has dethroned the King and enthrond your
government, you will release them and send them packing: You are as the Sea,
boundless, let loose from all ties and obligations of superiors, and none can
stand before you: You trample upon Parliament as well as upon King, imprison
him, and force these to do your work, and then a period.

At last you show us the grounds that you would have the Kingdom settled upon,
page 66. which I shall not much meddle with in particular: Only consider,

First, That you profess your selves (and it is your property) to be appointed
and called for breaking in pieces the powers of the world, and to be As the
Potstheards of the earth, that dash one against another: And in this you are
very skilful and able: But what then have you to do with settling? It Is not your
trade; you were never cut out for it, nor bound 'prentise to it; and so it
seems by the grounds you lay of common right; which are only framd with
respect to your own private interest, and have little of right freedom or
common in them, only much of safety for your selves, as you think: Why do
you dissemble with men, holding forth a foundation to settle the Kingdom, when
you know al things are unsetling, and for that you act.

Or if this be a ground laid for future settlement and safety, its a woeful
Babel, an Idol, a lie, a vanity, a thing that cannot save: Will this reach to
heaven, or save you from the flood of wrath that is broken out upon you? It Is an
unprofitable, empty, desolate thing, A vessel in which is no pleasure, neither
inward nor outward; Like the image of Dagon, fallen, and without his head; You
would think it Apostasy for men to go back to 10 or 20 years since, but to
plead for an age before the conquest, and run back to to the most barbarous
times; not only from God, to the glory of great states, but to Egypts Garlic
and Onions, to the dull, senseless people, and set them up, as Idols, to save
you, and fall down before this wood and stone, as things of vast concernment:
What a condition are you shrunk into? Ensnard in holes of earth. Here lies the
glory of your Saintship, of your Kingdom of God, or this is the end of al your
carnal and fleshly religion: This is the heaven you settle in, the grounds of
your peace; The Lord marches through the land in indignation, and wounds the
head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundations to the
weak; Thou did strike through, with his staves, the head of the villages; Thou
have wounded the head, the glory of the Kingdom, and now thou strikest through
the head of villages, not only destroy royal, but popular power, and do rip
up the foundations, and show the folly, rottenness and ungodliness of the
lowest stones as well as of the highest; None shall escape thy Righteo is
judgments.

Your last thing propounded is a contract or agreement; a contract or bargain,
not a marriage, for there is no husband; An agreement with death, no life, no
God; no, we have enough of them; Alas, they are poor things, they will not
hold a quarter of a year; a cobling device: Let us have a Savior that can
defend himself, and needs not to be tied together, and naild fast by an
agreement or contract: this is a poor God; an old Canonical trick,
subscriptions; Conformity for State as well as for Church; That none be capable
of any benefit by it but such as subscribe; None bear any office or place of
public trust; nor King except be subscribe; This is public liberty and
common right: There was never grosser tyranny ever appeard in the world: It Is I
am very sure, the last and worst piece of folly (in this kind) that ever was
brought forth; And after the casting off al powers, breaking al Covenants, this
comes in as a crown of the work, a great chain of darkness, to bind us to
the earth for ever; a great bog, in which we may lie fast: Where is that
liberty of the spirit, that glory of God that should make men confess God is
in you of a truth? This is your binding Kings in chains of Iron: Did ever men
fall from praying for, professing of, preaching of, aiming at the last and
great glory of God? as you do to such a beggarly rudiment, as agreement with
the people, subscription upon penalty. Your condition is well expressed, Isay.
65. 4, 5. Which say, Stand by thy self, come not near me, for I am holier
then thou. You say to the King, Bishops and Presbyters, stand by, thrust them
away, and their oaths, conformities, covenants; stand by all you Ecclesiastical
subscriptions, we will have a civil one: You required some, we will have al
subscribe: We are the most Righteous that have come yet, none before us did
such things as we; And yet, says the Text, Which lie amongst the graves: You
lie down in the rotten Sepulchers of the Bishops; their ways are dead and
putrified, and you go down into them, and defile your selves with them, And
lodge in the monuments: You have striven long for reformation, and for the
Kingdom of God, but at last wildred and nighted, you take up your rest and
lodging amongst the dried bones of your dead ancestors, would save your selves
by oaths, subscriptions, etc. which are the great signs of the uncertainty and
mortality of states; when they find they begin to dye, they set up their
memories on these monuments of Covenants and Subscriptions: And eat swines
flesh; that is another evil; You live upon that beast, a swine that loves
digging and rooting in the earth: You are not content with what the earth, by
the favor of heaven, sends forth, but are digging into, and turning up the
bowels of the Kingdom to satisfy your swinish appetites: Or love to wallow in
mire, and to lie upon the dunghill of the Kingdoms confusions, and take
pleasure in it: And broth of abominable things; you abhominate tyranny,
compulsion, enforcing in others, to impose and advance their own interest; but
refusing to do the thing it self, you eat the broth, do the same thing in a
looser, weaker, baser and more servile way.

You are the lees and dregs of the world, the tail of it; you think you are
the best, but are the worst; for the world grows worse and worse, and the
deeper you go into it, the further you are from God, and the nearer to hell, to
confusion; for the world has its foundations in the deeps: It Is a fond conceit
arising from the grossest ignorance and self-love, to think that you are
better then others, al your ways being more absurd, violent, irrational, then
the worst of those that have gone before you: You may read your description
excellently penned long ago, 1 Timothy 4.1, etc. Now the spirit speaks
expressly; He speaks to whom all times are now, who sees all things present: He
speaks truth, things are because he speaks them: Therefore does your glory
fade away, Because the spirit of the Lord has blowd upon it, and he speaks
expressly; There Is nothing the Lord brings forth more exactly, fully and
clearly, then the apostasy of carnal professors; a work wherein be delights
to be complete, and to do it to the life; to fill religious flesh, kicking
against him, with absurd folly and gross wickedness: In the latter times,
which are these days, when time grows low, it is the worst: That time wherein
we are looking for the greatest good, then appears the greatest evil.

And that in Apostates Some shall depart from the faith; the spirit says now
expressly you are these some; you have departed from the faith.

First, From the doctrine of faith, expressed in the last verse of the former
Chapter, and in the 6. v. of this Chapter, In the words of faith and good
doctrine: The most forward of you in religion do depart from the chief and
maine doctrines of Christ; and neither do nor can hold forth those mysteries,
God manifest in the flesh, etc. And from al rule of faith you do depart by
profession and practice: to speak to you concerning those commands of
subjection to Kings, Superiors, etc. is literal, legal, you have a spirit
above those commands, and those concerning the worship of God, you are above
Ordinances, etc. and so falling into a state of liberty and looseness from al
laws.

Secondly, You have departed from what you have believed, which was the
Kingdom of Christ, purity of religion, etc. into leveling, irreligious,
worldly principles, giving heed to seducing spirits: you talk of the Spirit,
but are led by an unclean spirit, a false spirit, or an erring and seducing
spirit; the devil and your own lusts have carried you away from the way of
Christ, which is by the Cross, to ascend to glory, by suffering to reigning;
but that way you decline and fall upon worldly contests for worldly things: I
wonder at your gross deceit, deceiving and being deceived (did I not know your
hearts are made gross and fat, that you are given up to strong delusions, to
believe a lie) that you should pretend to be led by God in your ways, and that
he goes before you, and yet are in such darkness (as your selves profess) you
see not a foot before you; but attend every day for new leadings, new
discoveries of the mind of God: into what a miserable labyrinth has the devil
led you! to go blindly and confidently after your own imaginations which are
confused, dark, and uncertain, and cause you to attend to those motions and
actings, and tell you it is the Spirit of the Lord. No no, The Spirit of God is
light, clearness, stability; it is that Anointing whereby we know all things,
from first to last, he leads us in plain paths; in ways of order, peace,
goodness: I abhor that that blind mole, that bat, that dusky night-owle,
that halting, blind thing which you follow, should be called by the name of God
or the spirit of God; Doctrines of Devils, of wrath, malice, accusations,
disorders, confusions, destructions, or as Mead interprets (...), of earthly,
humane, petty Gods or Saints; such are your Gods humane, earthly, weak Gods,
that have no glory, majesty nor excellency in them.

Verse. 2. Speaking lies in hypocrisy; Your justice, public interest, common
right are al lies; and so are all men, and things of men but a lie; and you
speak them in hypocrisy, cunningly, to deceive and seek your selves, and
your own interest, Having their conscience scard with a hot iron: God has set
some brands and marks of favor upon you, given you some victories and
success, to ensnare your proud hearts, to sat up the flesh for its
destruction: This, and your fiery, zeal for justice, for common good, which is
a base metal, at best iron (made to break things in pieces) but these, as a
hot iron, do so hiss in your minds, and smoke in your eyes, that you cannot
hear the voice of God, nor see his ways; you are so obdurate upon these
things, Gods glorious presence with you, the wonders he has done by you:
(things common to Alexander, Caesar; and many Heathens more in a greater way
then ever you had them) that you think it impiety, malignancy, etc. once to
question your way.

All the rest concerns you, Forbidding to marry, you forbid heaven and earth
to marry; forbid King and people to marry; and the same spirit goes so far in
some, as to deny marriage, and to maintain a community amongst men and women,
because In the resurrection there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage.
To abstain from meats; Many things you would have men abstain from, Kings,
Lords, Tithes, and many other good creatures of God, that your stomach cannot
digest, and you forbid others the use of them, because you are not sanctified,
neither do you see them sanctified by the eternal word and prayer.

You are drawing toward an end, and here I shall join issue with you, page
69. That since the heart of man is deceitful and corrupt above all things, and
most apt to answerable counsels and actings where it can hope to walk in the
dark, undiscernd and undistinguisht: therefore you desire liberty of entering
dissents: Upon this ground do I desire liberty to enter my dissent from you,
and upon what follows in your words, In these transactions of such high moment
to the public and all honest interests, and in times so apt to deceit,
defection and apostasy. With you, page 70. I profess, That as the exigence of
the case, and nature of the business requires (being of such vast importance
to all public, religious and honest interest, not in this Kingdom only, but
in neighbor nations) I have dealt with all plainnes and clearnes, as God has
enabled me. And now to conclude, we hope that in an age of so much light; mere
will and resolution will not be held forth and pursued against it: But that what
reason and righteousness there is in the things we have said, will be considered
and followed. It Is my request to you in your own words, and that you would not
in prejudice or disdain lay these things aside; but that you would, setting
aside your present actings of less importance far, yea, of certain danger and
ruin to your selves and others, you would consider what I have here proposed in
love to you, and for your good and safety, and the peace of the Kingdom.

He that being often reproved hardneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed,
and that without remedy.

FINIS.
