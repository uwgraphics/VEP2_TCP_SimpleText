The tyranny of the Cavaliers to the inhabitants of the City of Exceter.
EXceter, that famous City in the West having most nobly for the space of 3
months defended themselves against the proud enemy, who had so strongly
beleaguered the said City of Exceter, that the inhabitants thereof, could
neither have relief brought them, by land or water, though many times they
sallied forth against their foes, and manfully combated with them; the Enemy
being at the least, eight men for one, having also continual supplies of
Victual, and Ammunition sent them from the Cornish Cavaliers and diverse other
places, the Citizens together with the consent of that noble Commander the Earl
of Stamford being in great distress for want of relief, and Ammunition, having
first made an agreement with Prince Maurice upon several Articles, whereby to
prevent the resolute Cavaliers from plundering and pillaging their houses; the
Articles agreed upon I could here relate, but that I have greater mattes to
insist upon, and besides there has been something already Prinred concerning
the said Articles, which were agreed upon between Prince Mavrice and them that
were in the City of Exceter: now therefore I hold it a fit and convenient thing
to relate unto you the cruel and unlawful dealings of the Cavaliers, after
they had entered into the City.

When by all that reads or hears this book read, may the better understand how
far the destroying Enemies are from keepinging their promises, and how little
conscience they make of their ways: for it is too well known in all the
Western part^, that they which are called Prince Ruperts and Prince Maurice his
Cavaliers are most of them addicted to such cruelties, that they show
themselves more like Tigers, or savage Beare^, then humane men, and so they may
gain wealth they care not who they have it from, nor how they come by it; as
shall appear in this following discourse wherein shall be expressed nothing but
what I the Author of this News was an eye witness of, and will maintain it
against all objections.

The Cavaliers having entered the forenamed City of Exceter used the people
most cruelly and did all the violence they could do to them, only sparing
their lives; whereby we may perceive how far they are from keeping their
promises which they make.

The rude Soldiers would not forbear upon the least discontent given to them
to draw their Rapiers upon the Citizens, and wound them, but especially when
they are in their cups, they swagger roar, swear, and domineere, plundering,
pillaging, or doing any other kind of wrong; to break shops and houses, they
count it as nothing, taking away Boots, Sho^^^, Stockings, Hats, or any other
commodities they can lay their hands on, and no Justice dares to resist them,
and by this means the City is in such a miserable condition that they are even
terrified to the death.

The Majestrates of the City are fined at extraordinary rates, and when they
have paid what the Cavaliers demand, they will force them as they do in other
places to repay it again.

Sir John Berkly by His Majesty's authority was made Governor of the City of
Exceter, who is a member of such vile disposition that he favors their wicked
designs, whereby they become the more audacious: I being a native in rhat
country am in a very sad, and sorrowful condition for my friends and
neighbors who are Devonshire men born and bred. O that I could weep tears of
blood for them which by treachery are brought to everlasting slavery.

I grieve the more because I cannot power forth floods of tears for them. That
perfidious Chudley, who not only lost his opportunity of Medbury, and taking
of Sir Nicholas Sla^i^g. and the rest of his followers, which by humane reason
would have made the Cornish Cavaliers never to have entered into Devonshire
more, but like a double minded wretch, he did not only join with the enemy,
but also betrayed us into their hands at Stratten, for which piece of Service
he was made a Commander amongst the Cavaliers furthermore to manifest hi^
treacherous heart against u^ he with his Rapier wounded Captain Turpine when he
was taken prisoner at Topsham; also an unconstan member whose name is Sir
Thomas Heel (...) was by the means of Sir Ralph Hopton made Governor of
Tavestock, which lies between Cornwall and Devonshire, where he kept continual
Garrison; but on Wednesday September the nineteenth, Prince Maurice came from
Exceter with 1030 Soldiers, with their Carriages, and Wagons, and lay in
Totnis, which is seven miles from Dartmouth, at which place met him five
hundred Soldiers more, both Horse and Foot which came from Tarrington, and so
with full resolution they went to besiege Dartmouth, and to that purpose sent
five hundred Dragoneers to Salcome to stop the passages of any provision coming
thither; also they seized on all their Boats, Barks and Horse, whereby to
withold provision from them; but the men of Dartmouth behaved themselves so
bravely, that they found a piece of hot Service therein.

I do wish that Bastable, Bediford, and Apledore, with Grington, had been of
the like resolution as the Dartmouth men were of then had it been more honor
for them, then now it is: and they might have avoided the slavery which now
they endure, for Dartmouth men have to my knowledge sworn to fight it out to
the last man, rather then they will endure such thraldom as Exceter and other
places do now ensure, and if the Cavaliers enter there, it shall be by the
Sword, and yet if they get it that way, it shall do them but little good,
neither shall they long enjoy the town, for why the Seamen have vowed to bring
their ships into the Harbor, and to take in the best and the most part of the
Towns men's goods.

The better to manifest the inhumanity of rhese barbarous Cavaliers Gloucester
and Cicester by woeful experience can testify.

Cicester in Glocestershire having three several times manfully withstood the
furious assaults of the Cavaliers, was at last taken by them, where they used
such tyrranny that I verily believe, Pagans and Heathens would not have done
the like in their own countries, for after they had entered the Town by force,
they slew all the men that stood in opposition, and those that kindly laid down
their Arms to them and yielded, they like unkind usurpers carried them away to
Oxford Prison, where never men endured more misery, this being done they
plundered the Town of Gold, Silver, brass, Household stuff, Pewier and
Lodging, so that from the richest to the poorest, they were all undone,
insomuch that neither rich, nor poor, old, nor young, friend nor foe escaped
their fury: having acted their inhumane parts at Cicester, not long after they
laid strong siege against Bristoll, threatening the Citizens, that if they would
not surrender up the same, they would use all the extremity they could devise
to ruin and slaughter the people, and that they would not leave one man
unstain that sought to prevent it and keep them out of the City;
notwithstanding the Majestrates and Governor of the City of Bristoll
oftentimes gave them battle, and most valiantly repulsed them which when the
Cavaliers Comanders perceived, that by foul means they could not prevail, they
changed their Satyricall language into another speech, and became as men which
had altered their minds, sending a messenger into the City which told them if
they would surrender it up by fair me^n^s, they should have fair quarter, and
that never a man in the City should have one penniworth of wrong, only 50000
pound to be given them for composition; and all their Soldiers to be new
apparelled, which indeed had much need, for I think there were never so many
tattarty mallions seen in Bristoll before: but having entered the City, the
best meat, the choicest wine and cleanest lodging seemed not good enough to
please these tattared Cavaliers, who before wanted all things.

They went in to some Cellars where was plenty of wine, and beer, drank what
their gormandising guts would hold, and let the rest run about the house, with
many other antique tricks that they used, which I cannot omit to speak of:
moreover they break the Covenant which was made in every respect, the very
first hour that they entered the City and fell to plundring, pillaging,
robbing, stealing, cutting and slashing, as if they never had been brought up
to any other practice; so that now they that gave them entrance into the City
do sorely repent the barg^an: but now am I constrained to break off my
discourse of Bristoll, which might very well serve to fill up a large volume,
if I should relate the misery, and slavery that some of the people now remain
in which before used all the means they could to entertain the Cavaliers into
the City of Bristoll.

Which barbarous us^ge will gain them nothing but hatred and contempt, and I
hope in the conclusion their cruelty will fall upon their own heads, and in the
snare which they have set for others shall they themselves be taken.

We need not go far to prove the cruelty of these ravening wolves; for no
further then Hartly Row they took diverse poor people and put them into a Pond
stark naked, up to the knees in dirt, all a vehement cold night, and drove them
the next morning before them, calling them Round-headed Citizens, Parliawent
Rogues, and Parliament dogs: they likewise took diverse poor horest men, who
because they said they were for King and Parliament, they most inhumanely cut
off their ears, and gave them besides thirty wounds apiece; and not content
with this butchery took them, and threw them on a dunghill, with these most
unchristian scoffs, saying let the dogs lick them. They took diverse others
flying from them, and fastened cords to their f^et, and dragged them up and down
the streets, and when they were weary in sporting themselves after this savage
manner, they discharged every man three Pistols apiece at them saying, let us
trouble our selves no more with these dogs, and so discharged them of their
torments and l^ves together.

These cruel inhumane beasts in the likeness of men kill cattle great with
young. Likewise when they come where provision is, they feed their Horses with
Wheat, trampling more under their feet, then they eat.
