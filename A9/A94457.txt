To the Honorable House of Commons now assembled in the high Court of
Parliament. The most humble Petition of the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy and
Commons, within the County of Nottingham.
Humbly showing
THat whereas we are informed, that a Petition, together with a Remonstrance,
has in the Name of this County, been heretofore presented to this Honorable
House, for the abolishing of Episcopacie, and other alterations in
Church Government.

We do humbly crave leave to certify your Honors, that the same was done
without our knowledge, or consent, and that we do hereby dis-avow the same.
And with the like humility, do desire That the long established Government of
the Church may still continue, and that the abuses and errors of some
particular persons, may not cause the alteration of the ancient Government; but
rather, that such persons should suffer according to their Demerits. And we
likewise humbly crave, the Book of Common Prayer, by Law established, may
continue in force, with such alteration (if there be cause) as to your Honors
Wisdoms shall seem meet.

And as in Duty bound, We shall daily pray, etc. Subscribed by one Vicount,
five Knights, above a hundred Gentlemen of quality, all the Clergy of the
County, and above a thousand Commoners, being all of them Communicants.
