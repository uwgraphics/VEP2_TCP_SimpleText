TO THE HONORABLE, THE KNIGHTS, CITIZENS AND BVRGESSES OF THE COMMONS HOUSE IN
PARLIAMENT NOW ASSEMBLED. The humble Petition of the Lay-Catholiques Recusants
of England
Shows,
THat the chiefest and most glorious Attribute of power, being Mercy, the
safest address thereto must be Submission, which makes us in all humility
offer unto the consideration of this Honorable Assembly, the great and heavy
burden under which we groan, and though to Laws we humbly shall submit, yet
such is the weight of some that lie upon us, that nothing less then linity can
let us live, nor can we any way find out relief, but by applying our selves
unto this High Court, whereas Fathers and supreme Judges, you reside,
retaining still full power to frame, or change, according to the exigency of
times, and occasions, and being prudent and merciful, can afford us patience,
and favor in this short Petition, wherein we shall yield our selves fit
Subjects for your mercy, or obedient Submittees to your wills and resolutions.

The many penal Laws in force against your humblest Petitioners are to this
Honorable Assembly known, as is the ground on which they first were made not
out of memory, having had their birth but under Queen Elizabeth, when partly
extraordinary proceedings from the Sea of Rome against her person, and partly
the claim our dread Sovereigns Grandmother (wholly devoted to that Religion)
laid to the immediate succession of the Crown, occasioned several
distractions, and even cast jealousies and suspicions upon all, that in
Religion had relation to that See, whereupon from emergent reason of State, and
by way of prudent cautions, and prevanting future disobedience (and not to put
restraint upon the conscience of the Subject or to punish contrariety of
opinion or belief) these laws as we conceive were made, and afterward much
aggravated and made more heavy to us all, by occasion of that ever most
derestable plot, of those few decayed turbulent and desperately discontented
persons, indeed professors of the same Religion, but quite neglecting and
transgressing, and most inhumanly therein forgetting all duty and obligation.

If thus (Right noble Gentlemen) these Laws originally were appropriated to
these times, and no such reason now (we hope) appears, and still these Laws
overwhelmes us. It is either for the personal offenses of other men, whose
wicked facts, we (are no ways guilty of) with all good Christians utterly
abhor, or for supposed errors of our understanding and belief, which as in
it self (according to all Divines) is an effect immediate of grace, and
therefore not to be enforced: So in its tenets, there is not any thing forbids,
invites, or hinders the professors of it, from their due obedience to their
Prince, and faithful preservation of their Countries liberties. In prosecution
of which truth, we here abjure as false, and most erroneous, both
assasination of Princes, and faith is not to be kept with all sorts of people,
and do detest them both, as most oppugnant to humanity, and not to be allowed
by any Religion whatsoever; We also shall, and will be ever ready to maintain
and defend with all our powers, lives, and fortunes, all our Countries
liberties, the Rights, and Privileges of the Parliaments, the Subjects lawful
Rights, liberty and propriety, the peace and unity of his Majesty's three
Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, and in all just and honorable
ways, endeavor the punishment of all that seek or work the contrary; as
dutiful obedient and loyal Subjects are obliged, and as true borne Lovers of
their Countries good are bound; All which (under favor) as the Laws now
stand we no ways are permitted, as having neither freedom, nor fortunes of
our own, for strictly are our actions, Judgments, and our tongues tied up.

But the approaching storm that seems to threaten here, moves us to take
shelter under your mercies vvings, most freely spread to comfort all agrieved,
where we do hope for shadovv and protection. And humbly are Petitioners,
that you will be pleased to ease our sufferings, by mitigating the Rigor of
those penal Laws, that either ruin us, and our posterity, or cast a
thraldom on our consciences, so as we meekly vvalking in our Forefathers
steps, aspiring unto nothing but possessing our selves in peace, as people that
seek ease not honors, and that the crime of Catholics before this
Honorable Assembly ^o^ appears, but only different ways in serving the
same God you serve, the same Christ which you believe (for whosoever in any other
sort offends Quipeccaverit ipse moriatur) we most humbly in your prudence and
your goodness trust, in this public Iubilee (when all is intended to be joy
and consolation) we shall not be the only Subject of sorrovv and desolation,
nor that the Laws made for offenders in one time, should lay upon the
innocent in another. And therefore humbly beg, you will cast your eye upon
the Schedule of these Laws annexed and then your merciful repeal of what
your wisdoms and mercy find, shall give the conscience relief that is
afflicted, and not the mind content that is ambitious, and a thing we thirst
not after.

And for so great a charity your humble Petitioners shall ever (as in duty
bound) pray for Your continual prosperity and eternal happiness.
