The Fountain of Slander discovered, etc.
FFom my serious and frequent consideration of the goodness of God toward
man, the innumerable good things he created for his sustenance and comfort;
that he has made him of so large a capacity as to be Lord over other
creatures; ever testifying his love, by giving rain and fruitful seasons,
feeding our hearts with food and gladness: That he has made him, as his own
Vicegerent, to see all things justly and equally done, and planted in him an
ever living conscience to mind him continually of his duty; I could not but
wonder that this should not be sufficient to keep mankind in order, and the
world in quiet.

But when I considered the infinite obligations of love and thankfulness,
wherewith men, as Christians, are bo^nd unto God, and yet how extremely averse
all sorts of Christians were, to the essential and practical part of
Religion; so great ingratitude did quite astonish me.

And made me with much patience pass over the many injuries I have suffered
for my own endeavors after common good; and to resolve within my self, that
for any man to give good heed to the voice of God in his own conscience, and
vigorously to appear against the unrighteousness of men, is certainly the way
to affliction and reproaches.

And hereupon, when of late I have been hunted with open mouth, and could
appear in no place, but I was pointed at, and frowned upon almost by every man,
I was but little moved; for why should I expect better measure then my Maker
and Redeemer? And so with patience sat me down, and considered, whence so many
undeserved aspersions should proceed against me at a time too, when I was most
secure; all power being then in the hands of such, from whom I had merited
nothing but love and friendship.

I was sure any man that had a mind to know what, or where I was, might easily
trace me from my present habitation in Moor-Fields, to Newland in
Worcestershire, where I was born of no unknown or beggarly parentage, as some
have suggested to disparage me; but such as were both generous, as the world
accounts; and ingenuous too, as wise men judge; and to whose exemplary virtue I
owe more, then for my being.

I knew an exact account might be taken of me, in less then one days time:
and that this may gain belief, I shall refer the enquiry of my birth and
breeding to Mr Sallaway, a Member of Parliament for the County of Worce^ter*
and for my first eight years in London to Mr Crowder, another Member of the
present Parliament: The truth of whose relation, I suppose none will doubt, and
I shall be obliged to them, to satisfy as many as desire it.

For 15 years together, after that, I dwelt in the Parish of Saint James,
Garlic hill, London: Where, for all that time, any that please, may be
satisfied; since which time, I have lived in Moor-Fields, where now my Wise and
Children are; and what my demeanor there has been, my neighbors will soon
resolve.

I have been married 21 years, and have had almost 20 Children; my profession
has been Merchandising, but never was beyond the Seas; but my Brother died in
Flanders in my employment, and cos^ me near 50 pounds, rather then he should
want that burial accustomed to Protestants; which one would think might
suffice to prove me no Jesuit.

In all which time, I believe scarce any that ever knew me, will be so
dis-ingeruous as to spot me with any vice; and as little of infirmity as of any
other; having never heard ill of my self, until my hopes of this Parliament
encouraged me to e^gage in public affairs; being then 40 years of age, 20 of
which I had been a serious and studious reader and observer of things necessary.

But then in short time, I heard such vile unworthy things as I abhorred, and
made me blush to hear; and ever since, reproaches have pursued me, like rolling
waves, one in the neck of another.

All which being groundless, as my conscience well knew, I soon concluded,
they were devised purposely by some Politicians (whose corrupt interest I
opposed) to render me odious to all societies of men, and so to make me
useless to the Common wealth, which my long experience and observation told
me, was a common practice in all ages.

So as to me it is evident, that corrupt interests are the original of
Politicians; for a just course of life, or interest, needs no crafts or
policies to support it: And it is as clear to me, that Politicians are the
original of reproaches, and the fountain of slander: for that it being
impossible to desend an ill cause by reason; reproaches necessarily must be
devised, and cast upon the opposers to discredit what they speak; or it were
impossible for any corrupt interest to stand the least blast of a rational
opposition.

Most miserable unhappy therefore are those men, who are engaged and resolved to
continue in any kind of corrupt interest, or way of living; since they are
thereby all their life long necessitated to become mere Politicians, devisers
of lies, slanders, falsehoods, and many times to perpetrate the most honest
civilities that can be imagined, for supportation of their interest.

And upon this account I am certain, and upon no other, so much dirt has been
cast upon me; for when art and sophistry will not seem to vanquish truth and
reason, asperrion generally will do the deed.

Which has made discreet and considerable men to make a contrary use of
aspersions: For whereas the rash, and weak, when they hear either man or Cause
asperst, they presently shun the men, and abhominate the cause upon little or
no examination, as being affrighted therewith. Wise and discreet men, ^kilfull
in the common rules and practices of the world, and so far from prejudging
either the man or cause of evil; that without prejudging, or partiality, they
make an exact enquiry, how things are, and determine nothing but upon good and
real satisfaction.

And there is good cause for every man so to do; for if all stories be well
searched into, it will be found, That unjust, cruel, covetous, or ambitious men,
such as were engaged in corrupt interests, or in some wicked designs, were ever
the aspersers; and honest, just and public spirited men the aspersed.

That this is a certain truth, examples need not be brought out of common
histories, whilst the Scr^ptures abound therewith.

It was the portion both of the Prophets and Apostles, and of all the holy men
of all times: yea, our blessed Savior, who spent all his time on earth in
doing good, was nevertheless termed, a Wine-bibber, a Friend of Publicans and
sinners, a Caster out of Devils by Beelzebub the Prince of Devils. And who were
they that so asperst him, but the great and learned Politicians of the times,
who with the Scribes and Pharisees, set themselves against him and his
doctrines, because he gave knowledge to the poor and simple; by which, their
delusion, pride, oppression and corrupt interests were plainly discovered.

So that let no man look to escape aspersions, that sets himself to promote any
public good, or to remove any old or new settled evil; but let him resolve,
according to the good he endeavors, so shall his aspersion be: Nor let him
think, when time and his constant actings have worn out, one, or two, or ten
aspersions, that he is therefore free; but if he continue to mind more good, he
shall be sure to find new aspersions, such as he never dreamed of, or could
imagine.

Luther opposes the delusions and oppressions of the Pope, and his Clergy, and
the ruin of Emperors, Kings and great ones of the world, lays them all open
and naked to the view of all men: and who was ever more asperst then he?

Cornelius Agrippa sets forth a Treatise, entitled, The vanity of Arts and
Sciences; and is reputed a Conjurer for his labor.

How falsely and vilely were our Martyrs reproached and cruelly used in Queen
Mary's days, for opposing the wickedness of the great ones of that time? And
how unjustly Mr Geeenwood, Mr Penry, and Mr Barrow suffered in Queen Elizabeth's
days for publishing unwelcome truths, is yet sadly remembered.

Yet how odious did the Bishops set forth those that pretended for the
Discipline of Presbytery? all along comparing them to the Anabaptists of
Munster; affirming, that (whatever they pretended) they aimed to destroy all
Magistracy and Government; to have plurality of mines, and all things common;
saying any thing of them to render them odious to the people.

In like manner the Court reproached Parliaments upon their least show of
redress of grievances, or abatement of Prerogative; calling them, a factious,
sedi^ious, viperous brood, that intended to bring all to Anarchy, parity and
con^usion.

And even so diverse Presbyters of late have dealt with the Independents,
Brownists, Anabaptists, Antinomians, and the like; stiling them Heretics,
Blasphemers, Sectaries; and compared the Army and their Leaders to Jack Cade,
Wat Tyler, and John of Leydon.

And so about that time dealt the Parliament with many well-minded people, that
petitioned them for removal of long settled, and new imposed grievances,
tearming them factious, and seditious Sectaries; and burnt their just Petitions
most reproach^ully by the common hangman.

And just so now deal some most unworthy Independents with many the present
A^^^ters of common ^reedom, ^^iling them Levellers, Anti-scripturists,
Ath^^sts; and devise such scandalous, false aspersions against them; and
pulls the same with so much bitterness and vileness of expression, as if
they resolved of all that went before them, (...) Ra^shekah, to the unhappy
days of Mr Edwards, and his Contempo^^^ies, ^^ne should come ^igh them for
invention, or calumniation; and that upon no cause, except for opposing the
present corruption and corrupt interests of the t^mes; wherein it should seem,
many of them are now engaged, and taking pleasure therein, are as impatient as
ever Demetrius and the Cra^^s men were with Paul for preaching against the
Goddess Dian^, by making of whose Shrines they lived, it is like, very
plenteously.

And although nothing be more evident, then that Aspersers are ever deceivers,
and asperse for no other end but for their own interest and advantage yet are
not men sufficien^^y cautious to avoid their wiles, but are ensnared
perpetually; for let a man with never so much discretion and fidelity, make
known a public grievance, or an imminent danger, and propose never so
effectual means for redress and prevention, yet if one of these subtle
Politicians, or their Agents, can have opportunity to buz into the ears of
those that are concerned, thou the proposer art an Heretic, a Blasphemer, an
Atheist, a de^ier of God and Scriptures; or, which is worse to most rich men,
that he is a Leveller, and would have all things common: then out upon him,
away with such a fellow from off the earth; better perish then be preserved by
so profane a person: and in the mean time, who so seemingly pious, meek and
religious as the asperser? Whose council so readily hearkened to as his? which
yet leads to a certain bondage, or destruction, never feared till felt.

And truly but for these deceits in Politicians, and these weaknesses in the
people, it had been impossible but these times must necessarily have produced
much more good to the Common wealth: and it is wounderfull to consider, how
powerfully this delusion proves in all times; no warning or experience being
gua^d enough against it, though to a reasonable judgment, no deceit be more
palpable.

For generally the asperser is really guilty of what he unjustly brands another
withal: So, the false Prophets accuse the true of ^alsnesse: In like manner,
the ^alse Apostles accuse the true: The Scribes and Pharisees were, indeed,
friends of Publicans and Sinners, real friends of Beelzebub, as being the
chief of Hypocrites: The Pope and his Clergy really guilty of all they fained
against Luther: Emperors and Great ones of the world, cry out of
perfidiousnesse, and breach of Oath; who have broken so frequently as they? or
make so little of it when it is done? Those who cry out against Community,
Parity and Levelling, in the mean time enforce all to their own wills, both
Persons, Estates and Consciences, and if res^sted, fire and sword, halters,
axes and prisons, must be their Executioners.

The persecutor is for the most part the most desperate heretic, and those
that cry out so much against blasphemy, neither regard man nor honor God,
pretending Godliness only for by, and base respects: Those who make so great
a noise against Atheists, are they not such as say in their hearts, there is no
God? denying him in their actions and conversations, back biting,
covetousness, pride, and usury being no sins amongst them, men that have a
mere specious form of Godliness, but no power at all: Those that raise ^ames
of denying the Scriptures; you shall have them do it so as if they did it
purposely to bring the Scriptures in question, and write so in defense of them,
as if they bent all their endeavors (though subtly and obscurely) to weaken
the credit and belief thereof; and have the impudence to call their uncertain,
doubtful preaching and sermons the word of God, preach for filthy lucre, and
take money for that which is not bread; so that if people had but any
consideration in them, they would easily discover the fraud, policy and malice
of asspersors, and be armed against their stratagems.

And although the people for some time may be deceived by their delusions, and
do not perceive their devises: yet God in the end discovers them to their
shame; settling their nakedness and the shame of their nakedness open in the
sight of all men; and that garment of hypocritical Godliness with which they
stalked so securely, becomes a badge of their reproach.

The Scribes, and Pharisees, and Herod, and Pilat had their time; but are their
names now any other but a by word? and does not the Doctrine of Luther, shine
in despite of all his mighty opposers?

What gained the Bishops by bespeaking the Presbyter of so much errous and
madness, but their own downfall? what got the Courtiers by accusing
Parliaments of intending Anarchy and Community but their own ruin? and have
not these Presbyters brought themselves to shame by their bitter invective
Sermons and writings against the Independent and Sectaries?

3. And are all these forementioned, acquitted of the aspersions cast upon
them? and am I and my friends guilty? why must these scandalous des^mations be
truer of us then of them? in their several times there were believed to be
true of them, and its time only and success that has cleared them, and
should persuade men to forbear censuring us of evil unless the just things w^
have proposed, and Petitioned for be granted; and if we content not our selves
within the bounds of just Government let us then be blamed, and not before: but
what says the politician if somebody be not asperst, Mischief cannot prosper
if these men be believed and credited, down goes our profit. And truly, that
enemies to the common freedom of this Nation, or enemies to a just
Parliamentary, Government, enemies to the Army, or men of persecuting
principles and practices, should either divide or scatter these false
aspersions against me, I did never wonder at: beleiving these to be but as
clouds that would soon vanish upon the rising of the friends of the Common
wealth, and prevailing of the Army; And so it came to pass, and for a season
continued; but no sooner did I and my friends in behalf of the Commonwealth,
manifest our expectation of that freedom so long desired, so seriously
promised them in the power of friends to give and grow importunate in pursuit
thereof, but out flies these hornets again about our ears, as if kept ^ame of
purpose to vex and sting to death those that would not rest satisfied with
less then a well grounded freedom: and since, we have been a fresh more
violently ^yled at then ever, as if all the corrupt interests in England must
down, except we were reproach^ to purpose.

And certainly there was never so fair an opportunity to free this Nation from
all kinds of oppression and usurpation as now, if some had hearts to do their
endeavor, that strongly pretended to do their utmost; and what hinders, is as
yet, somewhat in a mystery; but time will reveal all, and then it will appear
more particularly then will yet be permitted to be discovered, from what
corrupt fountain, (though sweetened with flowers of Religion) these undeserved
clamours have issued against me and my friends.

But I shame to think how readily, the most irrational senseless aspersions
cast upon me, are credited by many, whom I esteemed sincere in their way of
Religion, and that most uncharitably against the long experience they have had
of me, and most unthankfully too, against the many services I have done them,
in standing for their liberties (and animating others so to do) when they were
most in danger and most exposed, never yet failing though in my own particular
I were not then concerned) to manifest as great a tenderness of their welfare
as mine own.

But in patience I possess my self; such as the tree is such I perceive will
be the fruit: and as I see a man is no farther a man then as he clearly
understands, so also I perceive a Christian is no farther a Christian then as
he stands clear from error, and superstition, with both which were not most
men extremely tainted? such rash and harish censures could never have past upon
me, such evil fruits springing not from true Religion; wherein, as full of
zeal, as the times seem to be, most men are far to seek: every man almost
differs from his neighbor, yet every man is confident, who then is right in
judgment? and if the judgment direct to practice (as no doubt it ought) no
marvel we see so much weakness, so much emptiness, vanity, and to speak
softly, so much unchristianity, so many mere National and verbal, so few
practical and real Christians, but busybodies, tale bearers, serviceable,
not to God, in the preservation of the life or good name of their neighbors,
but unto politicians in blasting and defaming, and so in ruining of their
brother.

If I now amidst so great variety of judgments and practices as there are*
should go a particular way; Charity and Christianity would forbear to censure
me of evil, and would give me leave to follow mine own understanding of the
Scriptures, even as I freely allow unto others.

Admit then my Conscience have been necessitated to break through all kinds of
Superstition, as finding no peace, but distraction and instability therein, and
have found out true incorrupt Religion, and plac^^ my joy and contentment
therein; admit I find it so brief and plain, as to be understood in a very
short time, by the meane^ capacity, so sweet and delectable as cannot but be
embraced, so certain as cannot be doubted, so powerful to dissolve man into
love, and to set me on work to do the will of him that loved me, how
exceedingly then are weak superstitious people mistaken in me?

That I believe a God, and Scriptures, and understand my self concerning both,
those small things I have occastionally written and published, are testimonies
more then sufficient; as my Whisper in the ear of Mr. Thomas Edwards; My
Antidote against his poison; My prediction of his conversion and recantation;
My parable or consultation of Physicians upon him: and My still and soft voice
(expressly written though needless after the rest) for my vindication herein,
all which I entreat may be read and considered: and surely if any that accuse
and backbite me, had done but half so much, they would (and might justly) take
it very ill not to be believed.

But when I consider the small thanks and ill rewards I had from some of Mr.
Edward's his opposers, upon my publishing those Treatises, I have cause to
believe they are fraught with some such unusual truths, that have spoiled the
markets of some of the more refined Demetrius's and crafts-men; I must confess
I have been very apt, to blunt out such truths as I had well digested to be
needful amongst men: wherein my conscience is much delighted, not much
regarding the displeasure of any, whilst I but perform my duty.

And in all that I have written my judgment concerning Civil Government is so
evident, as (if men were men indeed, and were not altogether devo^d of
Conscience) might acquit me from such vanities as I am accused of; but for
this, besides those I have named, I shall refer the Reader to my Word in
Season, published in a time of no small need; and to that large Petition that
was burnt by the hand of the common Hangman, wherein with thousands of
well-affected people I was engaged: and to which I stand, being no more for
Anarchy and Le^elling, then that Petition imports; the burners thereof, and
the then aspersers of me and my friends having been since taught a new lesson,
and which might be a good warning to those that now a fresh take liberty to
abuse us: but no heart swollen with pride as the politicians, nor so scorns
advice, spurns and jeers, and laugh at all* yet for all their confidence, few
of them escape the severe hand of Gods justice first and last, even in this
world.

Indeed it has been no difficult thing to know my judgment by the scope of
that Petition, and truly were I as deadly an enemy unto Parliaments (as I have
been and still am a most affectionate devotant to their just Authority) I could
not wish them a greater mischief then to be drawn to use Petitioners unkindly,
or to deny them things reasonable, upon suspicion that they would be emboldened
to ask things unreasonable, by which rule, no just things should ever be
granted; wishing with all my heart that care may be speedily taken in this
particular, the people already being too much inclined to be out of love with
Parliaments, then which I know no greater evil can befall the Commonwealth.

Another new thing I am aspe^^t withal, is, that I hold Polygamie, that is,
that it is lawful to have more wives then one; (I wonder what will be next,
for these will wear out, or return to the right owners) and this scandal
would intimate that I am addicted loosely to women; but this is another
envenomed arrow drawn from the same Pollitick quiver, and shot without any
regard to my inclination; and shows the authors to be empty of all goodness,
and filled with a most wretchlesse malice; for this is such a slander as dogs
me at the heels home to my house; seeking to torment me even with my wife and
children, and so to make my life a burden unto me; but this also loses its
force, and avails nothing, as the rest do also, where I am fully known; nay
it produces the contrary; even the increase of love and esteem amongst them,
^^ from those, whose goodness and certain knowledge can admit no such thoughts
of vanity or vileness in me: one and twenty years experience with my wife, and
fifteen or sixteen with my daughters, without the least stain of my person,
putting the question of my conversation out of all question.

There are also that give out that I am of a bloody disposition, its very
strange it should be so and I not know it, sure I am, and I bless God for it,
that since I was a youth I never struck any one a blow through quarrel or
passion; avoiding with greatest care all occasions and provocation; and
although possibly nature would prevail with me to kill rather then be killed;
yet to my judgment and conscience, to kill a man is so horrid a thing, that
upon deliberation I cannot resolve I should do it.

And though to free a Nation from bondage and tyranny it may be lawful to kill
and slay, yet I judge it should not be attempted but after all means used for
prevention; ( wherein I fear there has been some defect) and upon extreme
necessity, and then also with so dismal a sadness, exempt from that usual
vapouring and gallantry (accustomed in mere mercinary Soldiers) as should
testify to the world that their hearts took no pleasure therein; much less
that they looked for particular gain and profit for their so doing: and I wish
those who have defamed me in this, did not by their garnisht outside,
demonstrate that they have found a more pleasing sweetness in blood then ever
I did.

Now some may wonder why those religious people that so readily seem ^he
Polliticians, turns in catching and carrying these aspersions from man to man,
have not so much honesty or charity, as to be fully satisfied of the truth
thereof, and then deal with me in a Christian way, before they blow abroad
their defamations; or why the taking away of my good name, which may be the
undoing of my wife and children should be thought no sin amongst them? but
truly I do not wonder at it, for where notionall or verbal Religion, which
at best is but superstition, is author of that little shadow of goodness which
possesses men, its no marvel they have so little hold of themselves: for they
want that innate inbred virtue which makes men good men, and that pure and
undefiled Religion, which truly denominateth men good Christians; and which
only gives strength against temptations of this nature.

And as men are more or less superstitious, the effects will be found amongst
them; nor is better to be expected from them until they deem themselves, no
further Religious, then as they find brotherly love abound in their hearts
^owards all men: all the rest being but as founding brass and tinkling
Simbals; nor will they ever be so happy as to know their friends from their
foes, except they will now at length be warned against these cunning ways of
Polliticians, by scandals and aspersions to divide them; and be so wise, as to
resolve to believe nothing upon report, so as to report it again, until full
knowledge of the truth thereof; and then also to deal as becomes a discreet
Christian, to whom another good name is as precious as his own; being ever
mindful, that love covers a multitude of sins.

But I have said enough as I judge for my own vindication and discovery of the
infernal tongues of Pollititians, that set on fire the whole course of nature,
and am hopeful thereby to reclaim some weak wel-minded people from their
^odain believing or inconsiderate dispersing of reproaches; and so to (...) the
polliticians ends in this dangerous kind of delu^ion.

As for those who know me and yet asperce me, or suffer others unreproved, all
such I should judge to be polliticians their hirelings, or favorers; and I
might as well undertake to wash a Blackmore white, as to turn their course, or
restore them to a sound and honest mind.

^ However I shall no whit despair of the prosperity of the just cause I have
hitherto prosecuted, because (though at present I be kept under) yet I have
this to comfort me, that understanding increases exceedingly, and men daily
abandon superstition, and all unnecessary fantastic knowledge; and become men
of piercing judgments, that know the arts and crafts of deceivers, and have
abillity to discover them; so that besides the goodness of the cause which
commands my duty, I may hope to see it prosper, and to produce a lasting
happiness to this long enthraled Nation.

A good name amongst good men I love and would cherish; but my contentment is
placed only in the just peace and quietness of my own conscience, I may be a
man of reproaches, and a man of crosses, but my integrity no man can take from
me; I may by my friends and nearest alliances, be blamed as too forward in
public affairs, be argued of pride, as David was by his brother; yet I
think the family whereof I am, is so ingenious as to acquit me, and to believe
my conscience provokes me to do what I have done; but admit ^^ should not be
so, my answer might be the same as his, ^s there not a cause? ^ay may I not
rather wonder the harvest being so great, that the laborers be so few; if all
men should be offended with me for endeavoring the good of all men, in all
just ways (for I profess I know ^^ other cause against me) I should choose it
rather then the displeasure of God or the distaste of my own conscience,
affliction being to me a better choice then sin.

And this my judgment (as necessary for that time) I put into writing about 16
months since or somewhat more, but deserred the publishing, because it was
once denied the Licencing, (which by the way was hard measure, considering how
freely aspersers have been Licenced or countenanced against me) but chiefly I
omitted to Print it, because I thought my continual acting toward the common
peace, freedom, and safety of the Nation, would yet in time clear off all my
reproaches, and for that I could not possibly vindicate my self, but that I
must necessarily reflect upon some sorts of men, whom I did hope time and their
grouth in knowledge would have certified in their judgments concerning me, and
the things I ever promoted; But ^^^ding now at length, that notwithstanding all
times since, I walked in an uprightness of heart toward their public good;
without any the least wandering and deviation, (as their Petitioners of the 11
of September will hear me witness) notwithstanding I can prove I have rendered
very much good, to those that had done me very much evil, and from whom its
known I have deserved better things; yet my asper^^^s after the last Summers
troubles were over, flew abroad a fresh, (for in all that time I ^ad very fair
words) and no may but Walwin was a Jesuit, and a Pen^ioner to the Pope, or
some Foreign State: but for proof not one syllable ever proved one while I
was a Leveller, then on a sudden I drove on the King's design, and none so
countenanced as those that were offlicious in telling strange stories and tales
of me: Insomuch, as I found it had an effect of d^^er ^^wards my life; diverse
of the Army giving out, that it would never ^^ w^^^ ill some dispatch were made
of m^* tha^ I deserved to be stoned to death. All which, though I considered it
to its full ^^ue, yet did it not deter (...) my just Cause, according to ^^
just Judgment and Consci^n^^ this (...) my portion from too many, from whom I
may truly say, I had (...) better: yet in all these things it was my happiness
to have good esteem from such as I ac^^unt constant ^o the Cause, and
uncorrupted men of Army and Parliament, to whose love in this kind, for many
years, I have been exceedingly obliged* and who never shunned me in any
company, notwithstanding a (...) roaches, but ever vindicated me, as having
undoubted assurance of my (...); and believing confidently, that I was asperst
for no other cause, but for my perpetual solicitation for the Commonwealth.

But there is no stopping the mouth of corrupt interests, against which only I
have ever steered, and not in the least against persons; being still of the
same mind I was when I wrote my Wh^^per in the ear of Mr Edwards, Minister;
pro(...) still, as there i^ page: 3. I did, in sincerity of heart; That I am one
that ^^ truly and heartily love all mankind, it being my unfeined desire, that
all men might be (...), and come to the knowledge of the truth: That it is my
extreme g^ief, that any man is afflicted, molested or punished, and cannot but
most earnestly wish them all occasion were taken away -- That there is no man
weak, but I would strengthen; nor ignorant, but I would reform; nor erroneous,
but I would rectify; nor ^^cious, but I would reclaim; nor cruel, but I would
moderate and reduce to clemency -- I am as much grieved that any man should be
so unhap^^ as to be ^uel or unjust, as that any man should suffer by cruelty or
injustice; and if I could, I would preserve from both.

And however I am mistaken, it is from this disposition in me, that I have
engaged in any public affairs, and from no other -- Which my manner of
proceeding, in every particular business wherein I have in any measure
appeared, will sufficiently evince to all that have, without partiality,
observed me.

I never proposed any man for my enemy, but injustice, oppression, innovation,
arbitrary power., and cruelty; where I found them, I ever opposed my self
against them; but so, as to destroy the evil, but to preserve the person: And
therefore all the war I have made, other then what my voluntary and necessary
contributions has maintained, which I have wished ten thousand times more then
my ability; so really am I ^^ected with the Parliaments just cause for the
common freedom of this Nation. I say, all the war I have made, has been to get
victory over the understandings of men, accounting it a more worthy and
profitable labor to beget friends to the Cause I loved, rather then to molest
men's persons, or confiscate men's estates: and how many real Converts have been
made through my endeavors, reproaches might tempt me to boast, were I not
better pleased with the conscience of so doing.

Of this mind I was in the year, 1646. and long before; and of the same mind I
am at this present; and, I trust, shall ever but be so.

And hence it is, that I have pursued the settlement of the Government of this
Nation by an Agreement of the People; as firmly hoping thereby, to see the
Commonwealth past all possibility of returning into a slavish condition;
though in pursuit thereof, I have met with very hard and froward measure from
some that pretended to be really for it: So that do what I will for the good of
my native Country, I receive ^tis^ nothing but evil for my labor; all I speak,
or purpose, is construed to the worst; and though never so good, fares the
worse for my proposing; and all by reason of those many aspersions cast upon me.

If any thing be displeasing, or judged dangerous, or thought worthy of
punishment, then Walwyn's the Author; and no matter, says one, if Walwyn had
been destroyed long ago: Says another, Let Us get a law to have power our
selves to hang all such: and this openly, and yet un-reproved; affromed in open
Court; asperst in every corner; threatened wherever I pass; and within this
last month of March, was twice advertised by Letters, of secret contrivances
and resolutions to imprison me.

And so accordingly (suitable to such prejudgings and threatenings) upon the 28th
of March last, by Warrant of the Counc^^ of State; I that might have been
^e^cht by the least intimation of their desire to speak with me, was sent for
by Warrant under Sergeant Bradshaw's hand, backed with a strong pa^^y of horse
and foot, commanded by Adjutant General Stubber (by deputation from Sir
Hard^esse Waller, and Colonel Whaley) who placing his soldiers in the allies,
houses, and gardens round about my house, knocked violently at my garden gate,
between four and five in the morning; which being opened by my maid, the
Adjutant General, with many soldiers, entered, and immediately dispersed
themselves about the garden, and in my house, to the great terror of my Family;
my poor maid coming up to me, crying and shivering, with news that Soldiers
were come for me, in such a sad distempered manner (for she could hardly speak)
as was sufficient to have daunted one that had been used to such sudden
surprisals; much more my Wife, who for two and twenty years we have lived
together, never had known me under a minutes restraint by any Authority; she
being also so weakly a woman, as in all that time, I cannot say she has
enjoyed a week together in good health; and certainly had been much more
astrighted, but for her confidence of my innocence; which fright has likewise
made too deep an impression upon my eldest Daughter, who has continued sick
ever since, my Children and I having been very tender one of another: Nor were
my neighbors less troubled for me, to whose love I am very much obliged.

The Adjutant General immediately followed my maid into my Chamber, as I was
putting on my clothes; telling me, that he was sent by the Council of State (an
Authority which he did own) to bring me before them: I asked, for what cause? he
answered me, he did not understand particularly, but in the notion of ^^, it
was of a very high nature: I asked him, if he had any warrant? he answered, he
had, and that being dressed, I should see^t.

The Soldiers I perceived very loud in the garden, and I not imagining then,
there had been more dispersed in my neighbors grounds and houses; and being
willing to preserve my credit (a thing sooner bruised then made whole) desired
him, to cause their silence, which he courteously did: Then I told him, if he
had known me in any measure, he would have thought himself, without any
soldiers, sufficient to bring me before them: That I could nor but wonder
(considering how well I was known) that I should be sent for by Soldiers, when
there was not the meanest civil Officer but might command my appearance: That I
thought it was a thing not agreeable to that freedom and liberty which had been
pretended.

That now he saw what I was, I should take it as a favor, that he would
command his Soldiers off, which he did very friendly, reserving some two very
civil Gentlemen with him; so being ready, he showed m^ the Warrant: the
substance whereof was, for suspicion of treason, in being suspected to be the
Author of a Book, entitled, The second part of Englands new Chains discovered*
I desired him to take a Copy of it, which was denied, though then and
afterward by my self, and Lieut. Col. John Lilburn (who was likewise in the
same Warrant) importuned very much for.

Then I went out with him into Moor-Fields, and there I saw, to my great
wonder, a great party of soldiers, which he commanded to march before, and
went with me, (only with another Gentleman, at a great distance) to Paul's; yet
such people as were up, took so much notice of it, as it flew quickly all about
the Town; which I knew would redound much to my prejudice, in my credit; which
was my only care, the times being not quallified for recovery of bruises in
that kind.

In Paul's Churchyard was their rendezvous; where I was no sooner come, but I
espied my Friends, Mr Lilburn and Mr Prince, both laboring to convince the
soldiers of the injury done unto us, and to themselves, and to posterity, and
the Nation in us in that they, as soldiers, would obey and execute commands in
seizing any Freeman of England, not Members of the Army, before they evidently
saw the civil Magistrates and Officers in the Commonwealth, were resisted by
force, and not able to bring men to legal trials, with very much to that
purpose; and in my judgment, prevailed very much amongst them; many looking, as
if they repented and grieved to see such dealings.

Then they removed to a house for refreshment, where, after a little discourse,
we persuaded them to release two of Mr Davenish his sons, whom a Captain had
taken into custody without Warrant: but that kind of error being laid fully
open, they were enlarged with much civility, which I was glad to see, as
perceiving no inclination in the present Officers or Soldiers, to defend any
exorbitant proceedings, when this understood them to be such.

So the Adjutant General sent off the whole party, and with some very few,
took us, by water, to his Quarters at Whitehall (where after a while, came in
Mr Overton) the Adjutant intending about nine of the clock, to go with us to
Darby house.

But the Council not sitting till five at night, we were kept in his Quarters
all that time; where some, but not many of our friends that came to visit us,
were permitted.

About five a clock, the Council sat; so he took us thither, where we
continued about two hours, before any of us were called in; and then Mr
Lilburn was called, and was there about a quarter of an hour, and then came out
to us, and his Friends, declaring at large all that had past between him and
them.

Then after a little while, I was called in, and directed up to Sergeant
Bradshaw the President; who told me, that the Parliament had taken notice of a
very dangerous Book, full of sedition and treason: and that the Council was
informed, that I had a hand in the making or compiling thereof; that the
Parliament had referred the enquiry and search after the Authors and
Publishers, to that Council; and that I should hear the Order of Parliament
read, for my better satisfaction: so the Order was read, containing the
substance of what the President had delivered; and then he said, by this you
understand the cause wherefore you are brought hither; and then was silent,
expecting, as I thought, what I would say.

But the matter which had been spoken, being only a relation, I kept silence,
expecting what further was intended; which being perceived, the President said,
You are free to speak, if you have any thing to say to it: to which I said only
this, I do not know why I am suspected: Is that all, said he: To which I
answered, Yes; and then he said, You may withdraw: So I went forth.

And then Mr Overton, and after him, Mr Prince, were called in; and after all
four had been out a while, Mr Lilburn was called in again, and put forth
another way; and then I was called in again:

And the President said to this effect, that the Parliament had reposed a great
trust in them for finding out the Authors of that Book; and that the Council
were careful to give a good account of their trust; in order whereunto, I had
been called in, and what I had said, they had considered; but they had now
ordered him to ask me a question, which was this: Whether or no I had any hand
in the making or compiling of this Book? holding the Book in his hand: To
which, after a little while, I answered to this effect, That I could not but
very much wonder to be asked such a question; howsoever, that it was very much
against my judgment and conscience, to answer to questions of that nature which
concerned my self; that if I should answer to it, I should not only betray my
own liberty, but the liberties of all Englishmen, which I could not do with a
good conscience: And that I could not but exceedingly grieve at the dealing I
had found that day; that being one who had been always so faithful to the
Parliament, and so well known to most of the Gentlemen there present, that
nevertheless I should be sent for with a party of horse and foot, to the
affrighting of my family, and ruin of my credit; and that I could not be
satisfied, but that it was very hard measure to be used thus upon suspicion
only; professing, that if they did hold me under restraint from following my
business and occasions, it might be my undoing, which I entreated might be
considered.

Then the President said, I was to answer the question; and that they did not
ask it, as in way of trial, so as to proceed in judgment thereupon, but to
report it to the House: To which I said, that I had answered it so as I could
with a good conscience, and could make no other answer; so I was put forth a
back way, as Mr Lilburn had been, and where he was.

After this, they called in Mr Overton, and after him Mr Prince, using the very
same expressions, and question to all alike; and so we were all four together;
and after a long expectance, we found we were committed Prisoners to the Tower
of London, for suspicion of high treason; where now we are, to the great
rejoicing of all that hate us, whose longing desires are so far satisfied: And
to make good that face of danger, which by sending so many horse and soot was
put upon it, a strong Guard has ever since been continued at Darby house, when
the Council sits.

And now again, fresh aspersions and reproaches are let loose against us, and
by all means I, that never was beyond the Seas, nor ever saw the Sea, must be a
Jesuit, and am reported to be now discovered to be born in Spain: That because
I am an enemy to s^, ^^tition, therefore they give out, I intend to destroy all
Religion; and (which I never heard (...) now) that I desire to have all the
(...) in England burnt; that I value Heathen Authors above the Scriptures:
(...) know me, can testify how, though I esteem many other good Book (...)
well, yet, I ever preferred the Scriptures; and I have always maintain^^^ that
Reason and Philosophy could never have discovered peace and reconciliation by
Christ alone, no^ do teach men to love their enemies; doctrines which I prize
more then the whole world: It seems I am used so ill, that except by aspersions
I be ^^^de the vilest man in the world, it will be thought, I cannot deserve
it: And though I were, yet (living under a civil Government) as I hope, I ever
shall do, and not under a Military, I cannot discern how such dealing could be
justified: For, admit any one should have a mind to accuse me o^ treason, the
party accusing ought to go to some Justice of the Peace, dwelling in the County
or hundred, and to inform the ^act; which if the Justice find to be against the
express law, and a crime of treason; and that the accuser make oath of his
knowledge of the fact; then the Justice may lawfully give out a Warrant, to be
served by some Constable, or the like civil Officer, to bring the party accused
before him, or some other Justice: wherein the party accused is at liberty to
go to what Justice of Peace he pleases; and as the matter appears when the
parties are face to face before a Justice, with a competent number of friends
about him to speak in his behalf, as they see cause, his house being to be kept
open for that time; then the Justice is to proceed as Laws directs, as he
will answer the contrary at his peril; being responsible to the party, and to
the Law, in case of any extra-judiciall proceeding; and the Warrant of
attachment and commitment ought to express the cause of commitment in legal
and express terms, as to the very fact and crime; and to refer to the next
Goal delivery, and not at pleasure.

Whereas I was fetched out of my bed by soldiers, in an hostile manner, by a
Warrant, expressing no fact that was a crime by any law made formerly, but by a
Vote of the House, past the very day the Warrant was dated: Nor was I carried
to a Justice of the Peace, much less to such a one as I would have made choice
of, where my Accuser (if any) was to appear openly face to face, to make oath
of fact against me, if any were, but before a Council of State, where I saw no
Accuser face to face, nor oath taken, nor my friends allowed to be present, nor
doors open; but upon a bare affirmation that the Council was informed that I
had a hand in compiling a Book, the title nor matter whereof was not mentioned
in any law extant: whereas treason by any law, is neither in words nor intents,
but in deeds and actions, expressly written, totidem verbis, in the law. And
after, being req^^red to answer to a question against my self, in a matter
(avouched by Vote of Parliament to be no less then Treason) was committed
Prisoner, not to a common County prison, (nor for the time) referred to the
next Goal delivery, by the ordinary Courts of Justice, my* birthright, but to
the Tower of London* during pleasure, preferred to be tried by the upper Bench,
whereas treason is triable only in the County where the fact is pretended to be
committed.

All which I have labored with all the understanding I have, or can procure,
to make appear to be just and reasonable, but cannot as ye^ find any
satisfaction therein; being clear in my judgment, that a Parliament may not make
the people less free then they found them, but ought at least to make good
their liberties contained in Magna Charta, the Petition of Right, and other the
good Laws of the Land, which are the best evidences of our Freedoms. Besides, I
consider the consequence of our Sufferings, for in like manner, any man or
woman in England is liable to be fetched from the farthest parts of the Land, by
parties of horse and foot, in an hostile manner, to the affrighting and ruining
of their Families; and for a thing, or act, never known before by any law to be
a crime, but voted to be so, only the very day perhaps of signing the Warrant:
And therefore that such power can be in this, or any other Parliament; or that
such a kind of proceeding can be consistent with freedom, I wish any would give
me a reason that I might understand it; for certainly the mere voting of it,
will hardly give satisfaction: And now I well perceive, they had good ground
for it, who asserted this belief into the first Agreement of the people; namely,

That as the laws ought to be equal, so they must be good, and not evidently
destructive to our liberties; and I wish that might be well considered in
making of any Law: And likewise, That no Law might be concluded, before it be
published for a competent time; that those who are so minded, might offer their
reasons either for or against the same, as they see cause: But I forget my
self, not considering that my proposing of this, will be a means to beget a
dislike thereof, and may possibly work me some new aspersions.

I am said likewise to have worse opinions then this; whereof one is, That I
hope to see this Nation governed by reason, and not by the sword.

Nay worse yet; That notwithstanding all our present distractions, there is a
possibility upon a clear and free debate of things, to discover so equal, just
and rational Propositions, as should produce so contentfull satisfaction, and
absolute peace, prosperity and rest to this Nation; as that there should be no
sear of man, nor need of an Army; or at worst, but a very small one.

But if I should declare my mind in this more fully, it would, as other good
motions and propositions of mine have done, beget me the opinion of a very
dangerous man, and some new aspersion; there being some, whose interest must
not suffer it to be believed.

And yet it may be true enough; for I could instance a Country, not so
surrounded with Seas as ours is, nor so defensible from Enemies, but that is
surrounded with potent Princes and States, and was as much distracted with
divisions as ours at present is, yet by wisdom so order themselves, as that
they keep up no Army, nor dread no war, but have set the ^^tive Militia in such
a posture, as that all the Countries round about the^ (...) affront them with
the least injury; or if they do, satisfaction being not made, upon demand, in
48 hours, a well disciplined Army appears in Field to do themselves justice; it
being a maxim and principle among them, to do no injury, nor to suffer any the
least from Forraigners; as also, not to let pass, without severe exemplar
punishment, the least corruption in public Officers and Magistrates; without
a due reward unto both which, it is impossible for any people to be long in
safety; and to hold authority, or command beyond the time limited by law, of
Commission amongst them, is a capital offense, and never fails of punishment:
So that this opinion of mine is not the less true because I hold it, but is of
the number of those many useful ones, that this present age is not so happy as
to believe: Nor are we like to be happier, till we are wiser.

But as subject as some would make me to vain opinions, there is one that has
been creeping upon us about eight months, which yet gets no hold upon me; and
that is, That the present power of the Sword may reign; from this ground, that
the power which is uppermost is the power of God; and the power of the Sword
being now (as some reason) above the civil Authority, it is therefore the power
of God: But the greatest wonder in this, is, that some Anabaptists who are
descended from a people so far from this opinion, that they abhorred the use of
the sword, though in their own desence (to such extremities are people subject
to, that think themselves to have all knowledge and religion in them, when in
truth it is but imagination and Scripture) As for me, I am of neither of these
opinions, but should be glad once again to see the sword in its right place, in
all senses; and the civil Authority to mind as well the essence as the
punctilio's and formalities, but neglecting neither; and that the People would
be so far careful of their own good, as to observe with a watchful eye, the
right ordering and disposing both of the civil and military power; we having
no watrant to argue that to be of God, but what is justly derived, attained and
used to honest means; the ends, I mean, of all Government, viz. the safety,
peace, freedom and prosperity of the people governed; whereas otherwise,
Tyrants, Thieves, our-laws, Pirates and Murthere^s, by the same kind of arguing,
may prove themselves to be of God; which in real effect, perverts the whole
supreme intent of Government, being constituted every where for the punishment
and suppression of all evil and irregular men.

But why spend I my time thus, in clearing men's understandings, that so they
might be able to preserve themselves from bondage and misery, being so ill
requited for my labor? Nay that might have thanks, and other good things
besides, if I would forbear? To which truly I have nothing to say, but that my
conscience provokes and invites me to do what I do, and have done in all my
motions for the Commonwealth; nor have I, I bless God, any other reason; and
which to me is irresistible; unless I should stifle the power of my
conscience, which is the voice of God in me, always accusing or excusing me:
So that whilst I have opportunity, I shall endeavor to do good unto^^^ men.

But I have other business now upon me, then ever I had, being now in prison,
which (I praise God for it) I never was in my life before; where though I think
I have as much comfort as another, yet it is not a place I like, and therefore
am careful how to become free as soon as I can, my restraint being very
prejudicial to me; especially considering how the corruptions of some false
hearted people does now ^^eak out against me, in renewed clamours and
aspersions; which whilst I labor to acquit my self of, it proves to me like
the ^^ving* of the ever-flowing Fountain of Slander; the invective brain of
some resolved Politicians; for I see I must be asperst, till honesty gets the
victory of policy, and true Religion over superstition; the one being the
Inventer, and the other the Disperser, as the foregoing discourse will, I
judge, sufficiently demonstrate: And therefore henceforth let men say and report
what evil they will of me, I shall not after this regard it, nor trouble my
self any more in this way of vindication, hope to find some other way.

Only one aspersion remains, which I thought good to quit here; which is, that
I am a Pentioner to some foreign State; which indeed is most fall, and is
invented for the end, as all the rest are, to make me odious: And truly if men
were not grown past all shame, or care of what they said or heard of me, it
would be impossible to get belief; for which way does it appear? I think, nay
am sure, that in my house no man (bred in that plenty I was) ever contented
himself with less, which is easily known -- and for the apparel of my self,
my Wife and Children, if it exceed in any thing, it is in the plainness, where
with we are very well satisfied; and so in household stuff, and all other
expenses; and for my charge upon public, voluntary occasions, I rather merit
a charitable construction from those I have accompanied with, then any thanks
or praise for any extraordinary disbursments: and I am sure I go on soot many
times from my house to Westminster, when as I see many inferior to me in birth
and breeding, only the favorites of the times, on their stately horses, and in
their coaches; and when I have been amongst my Friends in the Army, as many
times I have had occasion, I must ever acknowledge, that I have received
amongst them ten kindnesses for one; and yet (not to wrong my self) I think,
nay am sure, there is not a man in the world that is of a more free or
thankful heart; and have nothing else to bear me up against what good and
worthy men (whom I have seen in great necessities) might conjecture of me, when
as I have administered nothing to relieve them -- when was the time, and where
the place* I gave dinners or suppers, or other gifts? For shame, thou
black-mouthed slander, hide thy head, till the light of these knowing times be
out; all that thou can do, is not sufficient to blast me amongst those with
whom I converse, or who have experience of my constancy in affection and
endeavor to the general good of all men, but to thy greater torment and
vexation, know this, they that entirely love me for the same, are exceedingly
increased, and many whom thou had deceived, return daily, manifesting their
greater love to me and the public, as willing to recompense the loss of that
time thou deceivedst them.

And this imprisonment, which thou have procured me, for my greater and
irrecoverable reproach amongst good men; thy poisoned heart would burst to see
how it has wrought the contrary, so far, as I never had so clear a
manifestation of love and approbation in my life, from sincere single-hearted
people, as now to my exceeding joy I find.

And possibly for time to come, these notorious falsehoods with which the
slanderous tongue has pursued me, may have the same effect upon these weak
people thou make thy instruments, which they have had upon me; and that is,
That I am the most backward to receive a report concerning any man's reputation,
to his prejudice, of any man in the world, and account it a baseness to pry
into men's actions* or to listen to men's discourses, or to report what I judge
they would not have known, as not beseeming a man of good and honest breeding,
or that understands what belongs to civil society.

But leaving these things, which I wish I had had no occasion to insist upon,
it will concern me to consider the condition I am in; for though I know nothing
of crime or guilt in my self, worthy my care, yet considering how, and in what
an hostile manner I was sent for out of my bed and house, from my dear Wife and
Children; the sense of that force and authors of my present imprisonment,
showing so little a sencibility or fellow-feeling of the evils that might
follow upon me and them, by their so doing; it will not be a miss for me to
view it in the worst cullers it can bear.

As for the book called The second part of Englands new chains discovered:
for which Lieut. Col. John L^lburn, Mr Prince, Mr Overton and my self are all
questioned: it concerns me nothing at all, farther then as the matter therein
contained agrees or disagreeth with my judgment; and my judgment will work
on any thing I read in spite of my heart; I cannot judge what I please, but it
will judge according to its own pe^ceverance.

And to speak my conscience, having read the same before the Declaration of
Parliament was abroad; I must profess I did not discern it to deserve a
censure of those evils which that Declaration does import, but rather conceived
the maine scope and drift thereof tended to the avoiding of all those evils:
and when I had seen and read the Declaration, I wished with all my heart, the
Parliament had been pleased for satisfaction of all those their faithful
friends who were concerned therein, and of the whole Nation in general: To
have expressly applied each part of the bo^k to each censure upon it, as to have
showed in what part it was false, scandalous, and reproachful; in what
seditious, and destructive to the present Government, especially since both
Parliament and A^m^, and all well affected people have approved of the way of
settlement of our Government, by an Agreement of the People.

Also that they had pleased to have showed what part, sentence or matter
therein, tended to division and mutiny in the Army, and the raising of a new
War in the Commonwealth: or wherein to hinder the relief of Ireland, and
continuing of Free quarter; for certainly it would conduce very much to a
contentfull satisfaction, to deal gently with such as have been friends in all
extremities; and in such cases as these to condescend to a fair corespondency,
as being willing to give reasons in all things, to any part of the people;
there being not the least or most inconsiderable part of men that deserve so
much respect, as to have reason given them by those they trust, and not
possitively to conclude any upon mee^e votes and resolutions: and in my poor
opinion had this course been taken all along from the beginning of the
Parliament to this day, many of the greatest evils that have besalne, had been
avoided; the Land ere this time had been in a happy and prosperous condition.

There being nothing that maintains love, unity and friendship in families;
Societies, Cities, Countries, Authorities Nations; so much as a condescension
to the giving, and hearing, and debating of reason.

And without this, what advantage is it for the people to be, and to be vot^d
the Supreme power? it being impossible for all the people to meet together, to
speak with, or d^bate things with their Representative; and then if no part be
considerable but only the whole, or if any men shall be reckoned slightly of in
respect of opinions, estates, poverty, clothes; and then one sort shall either
be heard before another: or none shall have reasons given them except they
present things pleasing: the Supreme power, the People, is a pitiful mear
helpless thing; as under Schoolmasters being in danger to be whipped and beaten
in case they meddle in things without leave and license from their Masters: and
since our Government now inclines to a Commonwealth, 'twere good all
imperiousness were laid aside, and all friendlinesse hereafter used toward
the meanest of the people especially (if Government make any dissension at all.)

And truly I wish there had been no such imperious courses taken in
apprehending of me, nor that I had been carried before the Council of State;
nor that the Declaration had been so suddenly and with such solemnity
proclaimed upon our commitment, there b^ing no harsh expression therein; but
what through the accustomed transpo^^* on of men's spirits toward these that
suffer, but is applied to us, so that we are looked upon as guilty already of no
less then Mu^^^y, Sedition, and Treason* of raising a new War, or hindering
the relief of Ireland, and continuance of Free Quarter; insomuch as though now
we shall be allowed a legal trial in the ordinary Courts of Justice: as
certainly the times will afford us that, or farewell all our rights and
liberty, so often protested and declared to be kept inviolable; and within
these two years so largely promised to be restored and preserved: yet what
Judge will not be terri^ied and preposest by such a charge said upon us by so
high an Authority, and attached by Soldiers, and sent Prisoners to the Tower:
nay what Judge will not be prejudiced against us?

If they should be persons relating to the Army, we are represented as
Mutineers: if to the present actings in Government, to such we are represented
as seditious and destructive: if such as are sensible of the loss of Trade,
who can be more distrustful to them then those that are said to raise a new
War: if any of them should be of those who are engaged in the affairs of
Ireland, to these we are represented as hinderers of the relief of Ireland: and
what punishment shall seem too great for us, from such as have been tired and
wasted with Free Quarter? who are pointed out to be the continuers thereof: if
any Jurymen should be of that sort of men who style themselves of the seven
Churches of God, what equity are we like to find from them who have already
engaged against us, by their Phar^sai^^ll Petition, for though they name us
not, yet all their discourses point us out as the princiapall persons therein
complained of; an ill requital for our saithfull adherence unto them in the
worst of times, and by whose endeavors under God they attained to that
freedom they now enjoy; and can Churches prove unthankful? nay watch a time
when men are in prison to be so unthankful as to oppose their enlargement?
what to wound a man half dead by wounds? a Priest or Levite would have been
ashamed of such unworthiness: what, Christians that should be full of love,
even to their enemies, to forget all humanity, and to be so dispightfull to
frinds? alas, alas, for Churches that have such Pastors for their leaders; nay
for Churches of God to own such kind of un-Christian dealing: Churches of God,
so their Petition denominates them; if the tree should be judged by his fruit,
I know what I could say, but I am very loath to grive the spirits of any
wel-meaning people: and know there are whole societies of those that call
themselves Churches, that abhor to be thought guilty of such unworthiness; Mr
Lamb a pastor at the Spittle, offering upon a free debate, to prove the
presenters of the Petition guilty of injustice, arrogance, flattery, and
cruelty: ye many members of these seven Churches, that have protested against
it; and many more that co^d^^^ them for this their doing, to whom I wish so
much happiness as they will seriously consider how apt in things of this civil
nature, these their Pastors have, been to be mistaken, as they were when they
misled them not very long since to Petition for a Personal Treaty, which I
would never thus have mentioned but that they persist for by-ends, offices or
the like (it may be) to obstruct all publick-good proceedings, and to malign
those, who without respect of persons or opinions, endeavor a common good to
all men. And truly to be thus fore-laied* and as it were prejudged by Votes,
and Declarations, and Proclamations of Parliament, under such hideous notions
of sedition and Treason; apprehended in so formidable a way, and imprisoned in
an extraordinary place, no Bail being to be allowed: and after all these to be
renounced and disclaimed by the open mouths of the Pastors, and some members
of seven Churches assuming the title of the Churches of God; are actions that
may in one respect or other, work a prejudicate opinion of us, in any jury
that at this day may or can be found.

So as I cannot but exceedingly prefer the ordinary way of proceedings (as of
right is due to every Englishman) in Criminal cases by Justices of the Peace,
which brings a man to a Trial in an ordinary way, without those affrightments
and prejudgings which serve only to distract the understanding, and bias
Justice, and to the hazarding of men's lives in an unreasonable manner, which is
a consideration not unworthy the laying to heart of every pa^aicul^r person in
this Nation; for what is done to us now, may be done to every person at any
time at pleasure.

Nevertheless, neither I nor my partners in suffering are any whit doubtful
of a full and clear Vindication, upon a legal trial; for in my observation of
trials I have generally found, Juries and Jurymen to be full of conscience,
care, and circumspection, and tenderness in cases of life and death* and I
have read very remarkable passages in our Histories; amongst which the Case and
Trial of Thro^kmorton, in Queen Mary's time is most remarkable: the
consciences of the Jury being proof against the opinion of the Judges, the
^he^orick of the Coun^^il who were great and Learned, nay against the threats
of the Court, which then was absolute in power and tyranny, and quit the
Gentleman, like true-hearted, wel-resolved Englishmen, that valued their
consciences above their lives; and I cannot think but these times, will afford
as much good conscience, as that time of gross ignorance and superstition did:
and the liberty of exception against so many persons returned for Jurymen, is
so mighty a guard against partaking, that I cannot doubt the issue.

Besides since in Col. Martin's Case, a worthy Member of Parliament, it is
cl^ar that Parliaments have been mistaken in such censures, as appears by hi^
^es^auration, and razing all matters concerning his Sentence out of the House
Book: And since the Parliament revoked their Declaration against the Soldiers
P^titioning in the beginning of the year, 1647. as having been mistaken
therein: since they have so often imprisoned Mr Lilburn my fellow Prisoner, and
some others, and have after found themselves mistaken; yea since some of these
Gentlemen who now approve of the way of an Agreement of the People, as the only
way to give rest to the Nation; about a year since Voted it destructive to
Parliaments, and to the very being of all Governments, imprisoning diverse for
appearing in behalf thereof.

I am somewhat hopeful, that a Jury will not much be swaied by such their
sudden proceedings toward us; as not perfectly knowing, but that they may also
have been mistaken concerning us now; for it was never yet known, that Mr
Lilburn, or I, or any of us, ever yet had a hand in any base, unworthy,
dangerous business* though sometimes upon hasty apprehensions and jealousies
of wea^ people, we have been so rendered: But (be this business what it will) I
do not know why I should be suspected in the least, and can never sufficiently
wonder at this their dealing toward me.

And as for any great hurt the Pastors of the seven Churches are like to do, by
their petitioning against us, though their intentions were very bad and vile,
yet considering how few of their honest members approve thereof, and that the
high esteem of the Church Way is a most wo^^ out, being not made (as the
Churches we read of in Scriptures) of everlasting, but fading matter; as the
Book, entitled, The vanity of the present Churches, does fully demonstrate: a
little consideration of these things by any Jury, will easily prevent the worst
they intended: Wherein also, possibly, they may deserve some excuse, as being
(probably) misled thereto by the same politic councels, as drew them in, to*
petition for a Personal Treaty: Such as these being fit instruments for
Politicians; as in the former part of this Discourse is evinced.

But, ^e it as it may, if I be still thought so unworthy as to deserve a
prosecution, a fair legal trial by twelve sworn men of the neighborhood, in
the ordinary Courts of Justice, is all I desire (as being ever more willing to
put my self upon my Country, then on the Court, or any the like Prorogative
way) and have exceeding cause to rejoice in the sincere affection of a
multitude of Friends, who out of an assured confidence of our integrity, and
sensible of the hard measure we have found, and of the prejudice our present
imprisonment might bring upon us, did immediately bestir themselves, and
presented a Petition for our present enlargement with a speedy legal trial:
whose care and tender respects toward us, we shall ever thankfully
acknowledge: But the seven Churches were got before the^, and had so much
respect, that our Friends found none at all; but what remedy but patience? all
things have their season, and what one day denies, another gives*

And so I could willingly conclude, but that I shall stay a little to take in
some more aspersions, which are brought in apace still, and I would willingly
dispatch them.

I and my fellow prisoners are now abused, and that upon the Exchange, by the
mouths of very godly people; so it must run, That say, all our bustlings are,
because we are not put into some Offices of profit and Authority, and if we
were once in power, we would be very Tyrants: But pray, Sirs, you that are at
this ^oosenesse of cons^ience, why produce you not the Petitions we presented
to your Patrons? Why tell you not the time and place, where we solicited for
any advantage ^o our selves? But allow we had done so, with what fac^s can you
reprove us? For shame pluck out the beams out of your own eyes, you that have
turned all things upside down for no other end, and run continually to and fro
to furnish your selves and Friends, thrusting whole families out to seek their
bread, to make room for you.

And how appears it, that if we were in any power and Authority we would, be
very Tyrants? We never sought for any, and that is some good sign; those who do,
seldom using it to the good of the public: And for ought is seen, we might
have had a large share if we would have sought it; but account it a sure rule,
that into Muse as they use: So generally true is it, that the Asperser is
really guilty of what he forgeth against another: And that this may appear, let
all impartial people but look about them, and consider what and who they are,
that seek most after offices and power, and how they use them when they have
them; and then say, whether those that asperse us, or we who are aspersed, do
most deserve this imputation.

Nay, we find by experience, that we are reproacht scarce by any, but such as
are engaged in one kind of corrupt interest or other; either he has two or
three offices or trusts upon him, by which he is enriched and made powerful;
o^ he has an office in the excise, or customs; or is of some monopolizing
company; or interessed in the corruption of the laws; or is an encloser of
fe^s, or other commons; or has charge of public moneys in his hands, for
which he would not willingly be accomptable; or has kept some trust, authority
or command in hand longer then commission and time intended or being in power,
has done something that cannot well be answered; or that has money upon usury
in the excise; or that makes title of tithes, and the like burthenous
grievances; or else such as have changed their principles with their
condition; and of pleaders for liberty of Conscience, whilst they were under
restraint, and now become pe^^ecuters, so soon as they are freed from
disturbance; or some that have been projectors, still fearing an
after-reckoning; or that have received gifts, or purchased the public lands
at undervalues.

And we heartily vvish, that all ingenuous people would but enquire into the
interest of every one they hear asperse us; the which if they clearly do, it is
ten to one the greatest number of them by far, will prove to belong to some of
those corrupt interests forenamed; and we desire all men to mark this in all
places: And the reason is evident, namely, because they are jealous (our hands
being known to be clear from all those things) that by our, and our Friend^
means, in behalf of the common good, first or last, they shall be accomptable;
and if those who hear any of these exclaiming against us, would but tre^^
their co^^^pt interests a little upon the ^o^ where the shoe pinches, they
might soon have reason of them, and they will be glad to be silent: and this
is a medicine for a ^oul mouth, I have often used very profitably.

And now comes one that tells me, it is reported by a very godly man, that I am
a man of a most dissolute life, it being common with me to play at Cards on
the Lord's day; there is indeed no end of lying and backbiting; nor shame in
impudence, or such palpable impostors could never be believed; and I am
persuaded the Inventers would give a good deal of money I were indeed
addicted to spend my time in gaming, drinking or loosnesse; from which I
praise God, ^e has alvvaies preserved me, and has so inclined my mind and
disposition, as that it takes pleasure in nothing but what is truly good and
virtuous; the most of my recreation being a good Book, or an honest and
discoursing Friend: Other sports and pastimes that are lavvfull and moderate,
though I allow them well to yet I have used them as seldom my self as any
man, I think, has done: But I see, slander will have its course; and that a
good conscience, and a corrupt interest can no more consist in one and the same
person, then Christ and Belial.

And for a conclusion to all these scandals, it is imposed upon us, that we are
an unquiet, unstaied people, that are not resolved what will satisfy us; that
we know not where to end, or what to fix a bottom upon -- and truly this has
been always the very language of those, who would keep all power in their
hands, and would never condescend to such an issue as could satisfy* such as
would content themselves with the least measure of what might justly be called
true freedom: But what sort of men ever offered at, or discovered so rational
a way for men to come to so sure a foundation for peace and freedom, as we have
done and long insisted on, namely, by an Agreement of the People, and unto
which we all stand: As for the way, and as to the mat^er, we have been long
since satisfied in our selves, but our willingness t^ obtain the patronage of
some thereto, instead of fur^herance, procured its obstruction: Because we
cannot submit to things unreasonable, and unsafe in an Agreement, shall any
brand us, that we are restless, and have no bottom? Certainly it had been time
enough for such an aspersion, ^f there had been a joint and free consent to
what was produced and insisted on by others.

For till a bargain be made, both parties are free, and may ^aise the price, as
occasion invites; so has it been in our case: At first, the little short
Agreement was by us thought sufficient; and had that been established, we had
rested there: but that being baffled, as the burnt Petition had procured that
Agreement, so the baffling of that ushered in, and occasioned the fullness, the
largeness of that Agreement which Mr Lilburn published: and if that had been
as^ented to, and established, we had rested then; and until after contract,
all complaints are unjust; and now if the baffling of this last, through further
observation and teachings of necessity; the next in motion should exceed both
the former in clearness of freedom, and removal of all grievances: would it
not rather be a good improvement of this time of suspension, then deserve the
aspersion of unsetlednesse: We wish those that upbraid u^ of unsetlednesse,
would settle according to promise; and if after, we content not our selves, and
stand to what is settled, then, and not before, let us be thus asperst: God
knows, how exceedingly we long to see this Nation out of danger, misery, and
poverty it is like to run into through loss of trade, and by reason of the
enmity continued amongst us, for want of such a settlement as we desire; and
which are defects, if by some men's policies it had not been prevented, had been
long since settled, as we verily believe, to the contentfull satisfaction of all
sor^s of people, and to the restoring of that peace, amity, love and
friendship, which has been too to long absent from us; and until which be
restored, this Nation will never flourish with that plenty of trade and
commerce, which alone can produce the happiness and prosperity of this
impoverished and wasted Nation.

Lastly (yet I am out of hope it will be the last, for I see no end of this
ever-flowing fountain) I am accused to have said, I never would petition the
Parliament, if I thought they would grant what I petitioned for; which, I
profess, is most false and absurd; for I never had any hand in any Petition,
but I desired withal my heart it might be granted; and a^ persuaded, if those
I and my Friends have presented, had been granted, it had been much better with
the Commonwealth then now it is; for we have been ever watchful for the good
of England, though now we are requited with a prison and aspersions for our
labor: and if the present time should be so froward as to reject the lig^^ we
bring, yet our comfort is, that our principles are of a growing nature, as
having the power of truth in them: so that we cannot doubt, but England will be
the better for our motions and endeavors to all generations.

I little thought when I began this work, that it would have drawn me out to
such a length, much beyond my disposition; but if I can avoid it, I shall make
amends, and never trouble the world any more in this kind: Nor had I done thus
much, but that through my easily pierced sides, they wounded the cause, I shall
promote whilst I have breath; they wound the reputation of the Family whereof
I am; and may too much wound with grief my dear and ancient Mother, whom I have
the greatest cause to love; my Wife and Children also are deeply wounded in my
reproaches, whom I value ten-fold above my life; and upon whom, whenever I
shall leave the world, I would leave no blemish: Nor should I, could my heart
be truly understood; for how exceedingly short soever I may come of doing my
duty in all cases, yet are my desires, inclinations, and intentions, as real
to the public, as free from baseness in my particular walkings and
occasions; as the corrupt Fountain of Slander is full of malice, treachery and
impudence.

Nor could I, as the case is now with me (this restraint being very much to my
prejudice) bear up my spirit with that contentedness, I bless God, I do; were
it not for the integrity of my Conscience toward all men: And whereas long
since I had concluded it for a most excellent truth, my experience now tells me,
that affliction is ten thousand times better then sin; and that the innocent
have more cheerfulness in a Dungeon, then corrupt and wicked men have, though
they are clothed in Purple, and fare deliciously every day.

This Discourse being thus far furnished immediately after I came into prison,
I did forbear to print it, because of its largeness, far exceeding my
inclination; and was much better satisfied to fall in with my partners in
sufferings, in publishing our joint manifestation of the 4th of April, 1649.
wherein we conceived, we had given full satisfaction to all men, and stopped the
mouth of slander it self; and after that, according to our promise therein,
having upon the first of May, 1649. published an Agreement of the People, to
take off that scandal then upon us, that we would rest or bottom no where: As
my three partners did, so did I judge my writing work at end, as not knowing or
conceiving that any thing remained in objection against me, that was not either
expressly or impliedly cleared and resolved.

And thereupon began to take some more content, that I had not published this
Discourse: When lo, on a sudden, just as I was to be made a close Prisoner,
there belches out from the corrupt Fountain of Slander, such a foggy mist of
lies, invectives and slanders, as would have choa^^ any but the spawn of envy
and malice to have uttered them: But that venom which destroys men, I see* is
the life-bloud of such ungrateful serpents, as now for former kindnesses,
watch this time of ^y affliction, to choke me with their pestilentiall breath.

But, I bless God, I am proof against it, I have a certain antidote they are
not acquainted withal, that published Walwyn's Wyles; it is called, a good
Conscience; which tells me, if that Book had been named by its true Father, the
Father of lies, it would have been entitled (for he sometimes speaks truth)
Lies of Walwyn: But it finds nothing in me, whereof to condemn my self; and why
then I should take so much pains as to answer them, I cannot yet resolve:
especially considering my causlesse close imprisonment, has somewhat weakened
me^ and possibly, being so fully known as I am, and being now thus restrained,
some may wish me so well, as to write in my vindication; if not, possibly I may
do it my self.

In the mean time, the ingenuous Reader of this will be indifferently well
prepared to a right understanding, whence all this filthy matter proceeds; ^^
being evident by what has been written, that the Politicians of this world are
Sata^'s chief Agents, by whom all discords and di^^^ntions amongst men are
begot and nourished: and that the Politicians chief Agent is his tongue,
wherewith in an evil sense, and to an evil end, he speaks to every man in his
own language, applie^ himself to every man's corrupt humor and interest, by it
he becomes all things to all men, that by all means he might deceive some.

And whom by slattery and delusion he gains not, by slander he labors to
destroy; his brain is the forge of mischief, the Fountain of Slander, and his
tongue set on fire of hell (as Saint James speaks)

Yet his words are cool as the dew, smooth as oil, and sweet as the purest
honey, weeps and kills, smiles and s^obs, prays, fasteth, and sometimes
preaches to betray, shrouds himself under the ^^^est (...) of Religion, takes
on him the most zealous form of godliness, and in this shape securely casts
his nets to catch plain-meaning people.

Such as himself are ^is associates; for without confede^acy, much cannot be
effected; and superstitious people, and their Idolaters, upon whose ignorant
zeal they work, and by whom (as by men religious, not prop^an^) they disperse
and send abroad their reproaches and ^^^^ders without suspicion.

Yet as godly as they appear, and as close as they keep, if you but once t^ke
the boldness to suspect them, they are discovered; for as their Father is said
not to be able to hide his cloven foot, so neither can these hide their double
dealing: do but never so little watch them, and you shall find they are made up
of Contradictions:

Very Religious in show, but very covetous in deed, given to usury and
oppressive gain, can possess the worlds goods in abundance, yet suffer their
Brethren to lack necessaries, yea, to lie and starve in prisons through penur*
and hunger: they can be clothed, as in purple, and fare deliciously every day,
but poor Joseph's and Lazarus's tears and cries are despised by them: Seemingly
humble, but upon advantage, none more violent, imperious, inhumane or
bloodthirsty then they: obstructers of justice, and all good things, neither
doing it themselves, nor permitting others.

In a word, observe them well, and you shall see Christ and Belial, God and
Mammon in one and the same person; Christ in show, the other in reality: -- Men
they are, that have no ties or bonds upon them, letting themselves loose to
lying, dissimulation, slandering, backbiting, and all kinds of circumvention;
God, Conscience, Religion, Reason, Virtue, are but mere terms and notions in
them, serving them to no other purpose, but to deceive the more effectually:
And to speak them all at once, they are the most ungrateful men in the world.

Their principal work is to make proselytes, to corrupt the best parted, and
most able Wits to take part with them; showing them all the glories of the
world, if they will fall down and worship them; and if they can but get them to
embrace any corrupt way of living, or but plant them in any corrupt interest,
they are theirs for ever, and must not stop at any wickedness; baits which
have taken too many precious spirits in these warping times.

And if this Discourse of mine serve but somewhat to warn all well-meaning
people, so as to beware of this kind of men, or rather Monsters; I shall have
the utmost benefit I expect therein; praying God to bless all my weak
endeavors and sufferings to the information of men, and good of the Nation.
