THE Rule of the New Creature to be practiced every day, in all the
particulars of it which are ten Gal. 6.16.
1. BE sensible Of thy original corruption daily, how it inclines thee to
evil, and indisposeth thee to good; groan under it, and bewail it, as Paul
did, Romans 7.24.

Also take special notice of your actual sins, or daily infirmities, in
thought, word, deed. Endeavor to make your peace with God for them before you
go to bed.

By Repenting, and confessing them to God, working your heart to gre^fe for
them, by some melting consideratio^s, as of Gods goodness to you, the
unreasonableness, and unprofitableness of sin, the prejudice, and damage
thereof to the soul, John. 1.1.9. Believing, or casting your self wholly on
Christ's righteousness, for remission thereof, and reconciliation with God,
Romans 3.22 24.25. Cleaving to Gods promises of pardon, and peace, Isaiah 43.25.
Rom 5.1. waitinge till the Lord shall speak to you, Psalm. 85.8.


2. Get your union with Christ, and interest in Christ, cleared, and confirmed
to you daily more and more, that you are a branch in his vine, a member in his
body, Cor. 2.13.5 This may be done 3 ways.

1. By daily renewal of your faith in Christ, especially of that act of faith,
whereby the soul knits, or ties it self unto Christ, casts, or roules it
self on Christ for salvation. Cause your heart in a solemn manner every day
to act this part, or put forth this primitive act of faith in the veiw of the
whole soul. The daily exercise hereof will increase, and strengthen the divine
habit of faith in the soul, and make the soul sensible of the very act of it.
By frequent believing you shall feel at your very heart, that you do believe;
so shall you have a witness in your self, that you are in Christ, 1. John.
5.10.

2. By examininge your heart upon what grounds you take Christ to be youres.

Are They 1. A sight, and sense of your sins, of the guilt, power, punshiment
of them, and of your misery by them? Math. 9.13. 2. Your want of Christ seen,
and felt at your very heart, to justify, sanctify, redeem, save you, else
you are utterly lost, and undone everlastinglie? Luke 19.10. 3. Gods free, and
general offer of Christ to any that will take him by faith John 3.16. manifold
promises to this purpose. The ground of all Gods offers, and donations of
Christ being free grace, rich mercy, undeserved love, Ephesians. 2.4.5.7. Titus
3.4.5.6. 4. Christ's sweet, and gracious invitatio^ of such to come to him as
are weary of sin. Math. 11.28. to buy as have no money. Isaiah 55.1. no
worth, or desert in themselves. 5. As sinful vile wretches as you are have
been sought of Christ, and found in Christ, as 1. Cor. 6.9.10.11. 1. Tim.
1.13. Phil. 3.7.8.9. why may not you?


The more clearly you discern upon what grounds you take Christ, the more
clear is your title to Christ.

3. By survaying, and observing in what manner you take Christ daily.

Whether 1. You do wholly renounce all opinion, and conceit of your own
righteousness, and desert, Mark. 8.34. Phil. 3.7.8.9 so that you come to
Christ empty of your self, very vile, yea nothing in your own eyes, unworthy
to receive him. 2. You lay hold on Christ alone with an empty hand of faith,
joyninge nothing at all with Christ in the matter of salvation. 3. You find the
Father drawing your heart after Christ Ioh. 6.44. in hungring, panting desires,
that will never be satisfied without him; so that the stream, both of your
judgment, Phil. 3.7.8. and affections 1. Cor. 2.2. Gal. 6.14. run toward
him. 4. You take Christ as a Lord to rule you as well as a Jesus to save you,
Col. 2.6. As one that is all. To you your all, your wisdom, your
righteousness, your sanctification, and redemption 1. Cor. 1.30 your
spiritual food. John. 6. Raiment Romans 13.14. Strength, Phil. 4.13. Life Gal.
2.20. Col. 3.3. 5. You seek, and wait for Christ (out of the sense of your
spiritual penuty) in every ordinance, public, and private, word, Sacraments,
Prayer, Meditation, Conference; not as they are your own works of
sanctification, but as they are Gods Ordinances appointed of purpose for the
manifestation, and communication of Christ to the soul.


Frequent perusal hereof will clear to you your manner of taking Christ,
which will evidence to you your right in Christ.

3. Labor to draw, and derive from Christ (by the pulling attractive force of
faith) ability sufficient for the day. Phil. 4.13. 2. Cor. 3.5. John. 1.16.


1. To perform all the duties. 2. To exercise all the graces. 3. To resist and
overcome all the tentations, and corruptions. 4. To undergo all the trialls,
and afflictions thereof.
Make your provision of grace, and strength from Christ every morning, fetch
so much as you shall have occasion to use all day long, yea and upon all
occasions, that fall out in the day go to Christ still for the wisdom, that
must direct you, for the holiness that must character you; for the shoulder,
which must bear them, if they be crosses; for that strength, that must resist
them, if they be tentations; perform them, if they be duties.

To this end act your faith daily in the promises of grace, and strength, as
John. 1.16. Ezekiel. 36.26.27. Isaiah 44.3. Zech. 10.12. which are both security
given you by God, that you shall receive grace, and conduit-pipes, or
instruments of conveying the same from Christ unto you.

This is the means to do all in the strength of Christ, and to take forth a
great deal of Christ into your soul, that not you, but Christ may live in you
Gal. 2.20.

4. Perform daily duties both in family, and closet (especially these 3. of
Prayer, Meditation, reading) with serious intention, heat of affection,
diligence, and delight, Ier. 48.10. Mal. 1.14. 1. Chron. 21.24. To this end.

1. Watch to these duties, 1:e. keep the heart in a good frame for them, Ephe.
6.18. undefiled with sin, untainted by the world.

2. Take fittest time for performance of them all; when you are least dull, and
sluggish. Begin the day constantly with the thoughts of God.

3. Be very real, serious, and substantial with God in them, Endeavor to
feel all duties at your heart, inliving, enlarging, inflaming your affections.

These be duties of most importance, and consequence, commodity, and comfort
to the soul, because they properly aim at, and reach to soule-good, and
celestial happiness, to train up a soul for heaven.

5. Fortify your selves every morninge against your special lusts to which
you are by nature most prone, or shall be most tempted, be it pride, passion,
covetousness etc.

1. By arguments, and holy reasoninges within your selves, drawn from the sad
effects thereof, as disprofit, discomfort, disgrace, or the like, to discover
the unreasonableness of your sin, and make your soul ashamed of it. For
example shall I be proud? then I am sure to fall, for pride goes before a
fall, and God will count me for his enemy, for God resists the proud. Shall
I be angry? If I let passion in, I cannot keep Satan out, Ephe. 4, 26.27. I
shall greive the holy spirit of God Ephe. 4.30.31. Shall I be covetous? I
cannot but be very sinful, since the love of money is the root of all evil 1.
Tim. 6.10.

2. By pondering in your mind precepts in Gods book against your sin
judgments threatened, or inflicted for it, on proud Herod, voluptuous Dives,
churlish Nabal.

3. By applying promises of mortification close to your hearts, as a plaster
to the sore, for subduinge your iniquity Micah. 7.19. Romans 6.14.

4. By drawing virtue from Christ's death into the soul, which has in it a
killinge force of sin, Romans 6.4.5.6. Phil. 3.10.

6. Get your hearts strongly fixed on God, by trusting on him Psalm. 112.7. and
submitting to him 2. Sam. 15.26. 1. Sam. 3.18. against all the fears, cares,
doubts, trialls, afflictions of every day, for sufficient to the day is the
evil thereof Math. 6.34. To this end.

1. Be prudent to foresee your personal trialls, and troubles, whatsoever
they are like to be Prove. 22.3.

2. Go hide, and lay up your self in God, run unto his name, for God is a
rock of habitation to which a poor soul may continually resort, God will
give commandment to save him Psalm. 71.3. 1. Peter. 4 19.

3. Especially cornmit that very thing to God, put it into his hands,
whatsoever you desire to keep, or fear to loose, 2. Tim. 1.12. be it life,
liberty, name, freindes, maintenance, etc. what you would have resolved, if it
be a doubt Psalm. 37.5. or supplied, if it be a want, remooved, if it be a
cross, Psalm. 50.15. and together with the thing, cast all your care, fear,
sorrow, and trouble of mind about it wholly on the lord. Math. 6.31. 1. Peter.
5.7. Psalm. 55.22.

4. Renew your faith in those promises every day which most concern your
present state; as in promises of supplies, if you be in want. Psalm. 34.8. and
37.3. and 84.11. Math. 6.30. of protection, if you be in danger. Psalm. 34.7.
of direction, if in doubt; of deliverance, if in trouble, of a good end, and
sanctified use of all. Deuteronomy. 8.16. Iam. 5.11. Romans 8.28. Heb. 12.10.

5. Labor to see Gods hand. Psalm. 34.9. believe his love. Heb. 12.6. Rev.
3.19. and with all meekness, and patience to resign up your self wholly to
his will in every affliction. Math. 26.39.

7. Get, and keep a savory relish continually of your christian privileges,
wherewith you are invested as you are new creatures in Christ: to wit.

1. Of your dignity, that you are Gods sons, Christ's brethren, heavens
heirs, pertakers of a high, and heavenly calling.

2. Of your liberty, that you are the Lords freemen dilivered out of the
hands of all enemies.

3. Of your victory, that you are thourough Christ more then Conquerors over
all the world of Creatures. 1. John. 5.4. of evils, of temptations, of
persecutions Rom 8.35.37.

4. Of your safety, that you have allmighty God for your place of refuge,
Psalm. 18.2. a hedge of providence. Job. 1.10. a Guard of angels. Psalm. 91.11.
an enclosure of mercy. Psalm. 32.10. and Gods promise as a writ of protection
for your defense. Heb. 13.5.6.

5. Of your riches, as durable substance in heaven. Heb. 10.34. an
incorruptible inheritance, 1. Pet. 1.4. a kingdom of glory, and crown of
life, for you are heirs of God, and co-heires with Christ.

6. Of your Joy, and pleasure, precious for kind, and plentiful for measure.
Psalm. 16.11. peace un-conceiveable phil. 4.7. joy un-speakeable 1. peter. 1.8.
the masters joy.

Get your hearts affected with all these as being yours. Chew, and suck them
by serious Meditation, work, and warm them on your hearts by close
application, rubbing them into your affections. Oppose these your spiritual
privileges to all your temporal pressures, settinge the one against the
other; as your heavenley freindes to your earthly foes, your high dignity in
Christ to your meaner in outward condition? your wealth above to your want
below; your future joys, and rest to your present troubles, and sorrows. This
will make you not only patient under the afflictions of this life Romans 12.12.
but joyful in them. Romans 5.3. and triumphant over them. 1. Cor. 15.55. Thus
did the Apostles. Romans 8.18. 2. Cor. 4.17.8. and 6.8.9.10.

These will provoke to duty 1. Peter. 9.11.12. and preserve from fainting 2
Cor. 4.16.17. and from trouble of heart John 14.1.2.

8. Sanctify God in your heart daily 1. Peter 3.15. make him your fear,
Isaiah. 8.14. your love, and delight Psalm. 37.4. To this end.

1. Have often high, and honorable thoughts of God, serious meditation of his
glorious Attributes, as his wisdom, power, truth, mercy, justice, etc. and
work them upon your hearts, that they may Echo to them with pure, and
meltinge affections. This will increase, and nourish up the divine nature fast
in you.

2. Labor to be affected with all the works of God, as to behold, and admire
the wisdom of God in the creatures. Psalm. 136.5. to see, and taste Gods
goodness in every mercy Psalm. 34.8. to take notice of, and tremble at the
anger, and displeasure of God in all Judgments. Psalm. 119.120. Habb. 3.16.
that you may answer the dispensations of Gods providence with suitable
dispositions; your hearts carrying a counterpane in affection to all Gods
actions.

3. Wrestle with God by praying, and beleevinge for an heart of flesh. Ezekiel.
36.26. which will receive impressions from the very thoughts of God in the
mind Also apply promises of particular affections. as of love. Deuteronomy. 30.6.
fear. Ier. 32.40. delight, Isaiah. 58.14. There is heat, and life in these
promises sufficient to quicken, and warm thy dead, and frozen affections.

9. Get a public spirit to mind the things of Jesus Christ, as naturally as
if they were your own things. phil. 2.20.21. to look on the things of
others, and prefer Ierusalems welfare before your chiefest joy psalm. 137.5.6.
and the Gospels liberty before your own, as Paul did; to mourn for the sins
of the times, as the Godly in Jerusalem did, Ezekiel. 9.4. Especially lay to heart.

1. The Churches misery, when Gods Ordinances go down, and superstition goes
up, when Gods cause, and fide are put to the worse, when any thing falls out,
which gives a blow to Religion, or prooves an impediment to the Gospel. If the
Arc be taken call your comforts Ichabods. Sam 4.21.

2. The afflictions of Joseph, Amos 6.6. The sufferinges of Gods servants,
whether Ministers, or people. Oh sympathize with them. Heb 13.3. Nehem. 1.4.
labor to feel their troubles, and sorrows at your very hearts; and pray
earnestly for them, as the Church did for Peter Act. 12.5.

3. The signs of the times. Math. 16.3. which hypocrites cannot discern,
though they be well versed in the face of the sky, to wit, the sad symptoms,
and presages of approaching Judgment, as

1. The commonesse of sin; for all sorts transgress in all kind of open
sinfulness with a high hand against light of nature,and means of grace. Genesis
15.15. Ezekiel. 22.4. 2. Contempt of Gods ordinances, misusing of his Ministers.
2. Chron. 36.16. 3. Departure of Gods glory from his house. Ezekiel. 9.3. 4.
Incorrigiblenesse after former, and under present judgmentes. lev. 26.14.11 5.
The death of many righteous men. Isaiah. 57.1. the carryinge away of others to
hidinge places. 6. The vialls of Gods wrath powered on the Churches beyond the
Seaes. Ier. 17.12.14. 7. An Inundation of spiritual judgmentes, as a spirit of
error, superstition, apostasy etc. which do commonly end in temporal plagues
Isaiah. 6.10.11
Now the Holyghost is a public spirit breathing, and acting in all the
members of the body mystical. Pray for it. Luke. 11.13. believe for it, Gal.
3.14. Ezekiel. 36 27.

10. Get your hearts weaned daily from the world, and from those creatures,
and comforts in itt, which are dearest, and sweetest to you. Wife, children,
freindes, Goods, liberty, house, life. This Christ requires of those that
follow him. Luke 14: 26.27 Mark. 10.29.30. this will prepare you either to
suffer, or to dye, either of which may put you upon itt to loose all. To this
end consider seriously.

1. That these things cannot satisfy your heart, when you have enjoyed them
to the full. Eccles. 4.8. and 5.10. you soon grow weary of them, or glutted
with them; so that you desire some new delights, or more of the old, or some
over again.

2. Nor can they sanctifye you, but expose you often to many lusts. 1 Timothy
6.9.10. tentations, distractions, to a spirit of the world, and they hinder
from following Christ. Math. 19.22.

3. Nor can they save you from Gods wrath, from death, or judgment. pro 11.4.

4. The wicked whose portion is only here have often the greatest share of
them, Psalm. 17.14. Job 21.7. to 14.

5. They serve only for this life, whilst we are on this side, of the grave;
they shall not be the least Ingredients into our celestial happiness. When
we do come to be happy in heaven, we shall stand in no need of food,
raiment, Physic, marriage etc. Math. 22.30. for we shall be like the angels
of God in heaven, we shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more. Rev. 7.16.
we shall live by the all-sufficient spirit of God, which never needs
refreshing; we shall be clothed with long white robes of Immortalitye Rev.
7.9. In a word, when we come to heaven the place of Gods Habitation we shall
enjoy the face, and beatificall presence of the most glorious Jehovah blessed
for ever, as an object, wherein all the powers of our souls will be satisfied
with ineffable delight, and everlastingnesse. God will be unto us all in all.
1. Cor. 15.28.
