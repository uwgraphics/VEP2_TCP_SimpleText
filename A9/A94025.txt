STRANGE NEWS FROM west-Smithfield OR, THE MAN-CHILD OF MANCHESTER: BEING A
true and impartial Account of the prodigious Knowledge and Elocution of a
Male-Infant, of three years of age, newly brought up to the Bear-Inn in
Smithfield; who at his first speaking, corrected his Father as he was reading
in the Bible, and at the same time discovered his ability to discourse in
Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, together with his desire of seeing his Majesty, to
whom he had three words to speak.

LONDON, Printed in the Year, 1679.

THE Man-child OF MANCHESTER, BEING A true and Impartial Actount of the
Prodigious Knowledge and Elocution of a Male-Infant of three years of Age, newly
brought up to the Bear-Inn in West-Smithfield.
SO Miraculous is the ensuing Narrative, that perhaps, it will scarce meet with
Belief enough to entertain it, among those at least, who are unwilling to
believe any other Deity than Nature: Yet such is the Truth of the Contents, and
so lively an Instance is it of an Omnipotencey, that we should be injurious to
the ensuing Ages, if we should not transmit the present Account to Posterity.
The whole of the Truth is this, That Charles the Son of Philip Bennet, of
Manchester in Lancashire, who was born about the middle of June, which was in
the year of our Lord God 1676. was by his Parents looked upon ever since as a
Child of no more than ordinary Capacity; his forwardness and the Endowments of
Nature appeared in him not so great as to be admired, nor so mean as to be
repined at; Nor was there any observation to be made of extraordinay Maturity
in the Child, till about a Month or two ago, when his Father being according to
his usual and commendable Custom, Reading to his Family in the Bible, and
indeed misreciting one Sentence, the Child of a sudden broke out into these
words: Father you read wrong, for it is not so in the Scripture; whereat the
Father being wrapped in Amazement, as well he might, having never heard the Child
speak before) began, after some Recollection of himself, to examine the place
of Scripture which he had then read in the Child's hearing, and found (according
to the Child's words) that it was otherwise writren than he had read it.
Hereupon his wonder increased, and he asked the Child how he could know what
was in the Bible, who replied, he not only had it in his Memory, but that could
read it in the Bible, not only in English but Latin, and further told his
Father, that he could speak Greek and Hebrew, and after all added, that he had
three words which he must speak to the King. Hereupon the Parents as soon they
could raise money to bring them up, caused the Child to be brought up by one
Mr. Bass the younger, Carrier of Tamworth in warwickshire, who lodges at the
Bear and Ragged Staff in West-Smithfield, who thither brought the Child on
Saturday the 28th day of this instant June, where Innumerable multitudes came
on Saturday night and all Sunday, to see this Child, and hear him speak, where
several of good Quality obtained the favor of the house, and not only saw the
Child, but discoursed with him, and upon Examination, found that he made very
ready and apposite Answers to several Questions which they asked him, as well
in Latin and Greek, as in English. The Child is very small for his Age, of a
round Visage, and black brown Hair: his Father is a Linnen-weaver in
Manchester, but of low Fortune, therefore whereas it is objected by some, that
his Father might have been used to repeat several Sentences of Latin and Greek
in the Child's hearing, and thereby (Psiitacimore) the Child might learn to
pronounce them, we have reason to believe the contrary, in regard that one of
so mean Ed^cation and inferior Calling, could hardly be capable of teaching
another in those Languages of which it is strongly to be presumed that he
himself was ignorant.

This Child persisted all Sunday in Expressions of his earnest desire to see
the King, and speak his three Words to him, after which, (said the Child) I
shall live but nine Days, and they being finished, I expect to dye.

His Majesty having Information hereof was pleased this Monday Morning to send
his Messenger for the Child, who from the Bear-Inn immediately carried the
Child away in a Coach to White Hall, and though His Majesty had intended this
Day to have gone to Windsor, yet it is said he deferred the same till to Morrow;
and (its thought by many) upon this very occasion, as being desirous ^o hear
what the Child had to say to ^im.

Several People have endeavored to tempt the Child with Money to impart to
them what words he has to say to the King, but the Child refuses to disclose it
to any, nay even to his own Father. Nor will the Child accept of either Silver
of Gold from any upon whatsoever Account it be offered to him; and if any one
chance to thrust it into his hand, he straightway throws it over his Head, in
Token of his Contempt of their Offers; but the Parents however are not of the
same mind in that, but retain whatever any shall freely present them with, as
knowing that their Circumstances in the World are low, and that the curiosity
of others may without injustice be expected to defray the Expenses of their
Journey up to London.

The Child is very remarkable for the quickness of his Eye, which shows as if
it were transparent, and darts a piercing and sprightly Ray upon all things.
The Parents, between Love and Fear, know not what to think of their Child, nor
how to demean themselves toward it; one while his early and extraordinary
Maturity gives them hope of Gain and Preferment; another while it raises their
fear of loosing their Child, whose extraordinary Qualifications has engaged
their extraordinary love, and the more does the fear of loosing him oppress
them, in that the Child so particularly points out the number of the days of
his life after his 3 words spoken.

FINIS.
