The true Copy of a PETITION, DELIVERED To the Right Honorable the Lord Major,
Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council assembled, on
Tuesday the 23 of June, 1646.
To the Right Honorable the Lord MAJOR, the Right Worshipful the ALDERMEN and
COMMONS of the City of LONDON, in Common Council assembled.
The humble Petition of diverse well-affected Citizens and Freemen of London,
under the Jurisdiction of the Lord Major.
Shows,
THat the great care and uncessant pains of this Honorable Court, for
promoting the Cause of God, is so eminently known, that your Petitioners
conceive they shall be too much wanting to their own duty and safety, if they
should be backward in the thankful acknowledgement thereof; Wherefore, as
they give You many humble and hearty Thanks for what You have already done in
reference to the Public Good, so being desirous, what in them lies, yet
further to strengthen your hands to so glorious a Work, they cannot but let You
know their Resolutions to adhere unto You in all your just and legal
Proceedings: Not doubting but the same good hand of God that has hitherto been
with You, will be still upon You for good, while You endeavor in your Places
the establishment of Truth and Peace, and the removal of those pressing
Grievances that lie upon us, as You have lately done in that Free and
Necessary, yet Humble and Dutiful Remonstrance and Petition to the Honorable
Houses of Parliament. And however there want not those for the present, who out
of self-respects calumniate your good Intentions therein; yet being persuaded
that in very faithfulness to the Public You have done it; Your Petitioners
not only approve of it, but rejoice in it, the rather, since they know no
other orderly way for obtaining Remedy for their Common Grievances, then by
Your addresses to the Parliament in their behalf.

Your Petitioners therefore humbly Pray, That this Honorable Court would be
pleased still to persevere, and courageously go on in and by all Pious and
Prudent means, endeavoring the speedy settlement of Religion, the Peace of
the Kingdom, the Union of both Nations, the safety and welfare of this City,
and in a word, the performance of that Covenant wherein we are solemnly engaged
to God the Righteous Judge of all the World. In reference to all which good
ends, Your Petitioners further pray, That you would still continue your humble
Addresses to the Parliament, not only for a gracious Answer to your said late
Remonstrance, but for all such other things as shall necessarily conduce to
putting an happy period to our present miserable Distractions: And that in the
mean time you would put in execution among your selves so many branches
there^f, as the Power wherewith (by the Laws of this Kingdom) you are already
invested, will extend unto.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray, etc.
THis Petition was subscribed by many Thousands, all of them Citizens of the
best rank and quality, Freemen and Inhabitants within the Jurisdiction of the
Lord Major, and presented by many grave and eminent Persons of worth and
quality, in the Names of themselves and all the rest of the Subscribers.

Further, they did declare the reason wherefore they did present the said
Petition, because they did perceive by diverse scandalous Pamphlets, published
and set forth (by some who are no friends to Peace, Truth, and Government)
wherein it is declared that the late Remonstrance and Petition presented to the
Honorable Houses of Parliament by the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Commons of the
City of London, was not the Act of the City, but of some few of the
Common Council. To prevent which gross untruth, the said Citizens did present
this Petition thus subscribed, to show their concurrence with, and approbation
of so good a Work; and likewise to manifest their good affections and earnest
desires of a well grounded Peace, and of a settled Government in Church and
Commonwealth; and of using all good and lawful means for the removal of
those pressing Grievances that so heavily are upon them. As also to express
their utter dislike to the proceedings of those who have replied against the
said Remonstrance.
