TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE LORD MAYOR, THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL THE ALDERMEN AND
COMMONS Of the City of LONDON in COMMON COUNCIL Assembled.
The Humble PETITION of diverse well affected CITIZENS and Freemen of LONDON,
under the Jurisdiction of the Lord Mayor.
Shows:

THat the great care and uncessant pains of this Honorable Court, for
promoting the Cause of God is so eminently known, that your Petitioner^
conceive they shall be too much wanting to their own duty, and safety, if they
should be backward in the thankful acknowledgement thereon Wherefore, as they
give You many humble and hearty thanks for what You have already done in
reference to the Public Good, so being desirous, what in them lies, yet
farther to strengthen your hands to so glorious a work, they cannot but let You
know their Resolutions to adhere unto you in all your just and legal
proceedings: Not doubting (...) the same good hand of God that has hitherto
been with You, will still be upon You for good, while you endeavor in ^our
places the establishment of Truth and Peace, and the removal of those pressing
Grievances that lie upon us, as you have lately done in that free and
necess^rie, yet Humble and Dutiful Remonstrance and Petition to the Honorable
Houses of Parliament. And however there want not those for the present, who out
of self-respects calumniate your good intentions therein, yet being persuaded
that in very faithfulness to the Public You have done it; Your Petitioners
not only approve of it, but rejoice in it, the rather, since they know no
other orderly way for obtaining remedy for their common Grievances, then by
your addresses to the Parliament in their behalf.

Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray, That this Honorable Court would be
pleased still to persevere, and courageously to go on in and by all pious and
prudent means, endeavoring the speed^e settlement of Religion, the Peace of
the Kingdom, the Union of both Nations, the safety and welfare of this City,
and in a word, the performance of that Covenant wherein we are solem^ly engaged
to God the Righteous Judge of all the world. In reference to all which go^d
e^ds, Your Petitioners further pray, Tha^ you would still continue your Humble
addresses to the Parliament, not only ^or a gracious Answer to your said late
Remonstrance, b^t for all such other things as shall necessarily conduce to
putting an happy period to our present miserable (...); And that in the m^a^
tim^ you would put in execution, among your selves, so many branches thereof as
the Power wherewith (by the Laws of this Kingdom, you are already invested,
will extend unto.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray, etc.
