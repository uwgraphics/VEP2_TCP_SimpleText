A RELATION OF A QUAKER, That to the Shame of his Profession, Attempted to
Bugger a Mare near Colchester.
ALL in the Land of Essex
Near Colchester the Zealous,
On the side of a bank,
Was played such a prank,
As would make a Stone-horse jealous.
Help Woodcock, Fox, and Nailor.
For Brother Green's a Stalion,
Now Alas what hope,
Of converting the Pope,
When a Quaker turns Italian.
Unto our whole profession,
A scandal twill be counted,
When it is talked with difdain,
Amongst the Profane,
How Brother Green was mounted.
And in the good time of Christmas,
Which though the Saints have damned all,
Yet when did they hear
Of a damned Cavalier
Ere played such a Christmas gamball.
Had thy flesh, O Green, been pampered
With any Cates unhallowed,
Had thou sweetened thy Gumbs
With Pottage of Plumbs
Or profane minced pie had swallowed.
Rolled up in wanton swines flesh,
The fiend might have crept into thee,
Then fullness of gut
Might have made thee rut
And the devil so have rid through thee.
But Alas, he had been feasted
With a spiritual Collation
By our frugall Mayer,
Who can dine with a Prayer
And sup with an Exhortation.
It Was mere impulse of Spirit,
Though he used the weapon carnal,
Filly Foal quoth he
My Bride thou shall be:
Now how this is lawful, learn all.
For if no respect of persons
Be due amongst the sons of Adam
In a large extent
Then may it be meant
That a Mare's as good as a Madam.
Then without more Ceremony,
Nor Bonnet veiled, nor Kissed her,
He took her by force
For better for worse
And he used her like a Sister.
Now when in such a Saddle
A Saint will needs be riding,
Though I dare not say
It Is a falling away
May there not be some backsliding.
No surely quoth James Nailor
It Was but an insurrection
Of the Carnal part,
For a Quaker in heart
Can never lose perfection.
For so our Hist. of Jesuitism.
Masters Teach us
The intent being well directed;
Though the devil Trapan
The Adamicall man,
The Saint stands uninfected.
But yet a Pagan Jury
Still Judges what is intended,
Then say what we can
Brother Green's outward man
I fear will be suspended.
And our Adopted Sister
Will find no better quarter,
But when him we inroule
For a Saint; Filly Foal
Shall pass at least for a Martyr.
Now Rome that Spiritual Sodom
No longer is thy debtor,
O Colchester now
Who Is Sodom, but thou,
Even according to the Letter.
Help Woodcock, Fox and Nailor
For Brother Green's a Stallion,
Now Alas what hope
Of converting the Pope
When a Quaker turns Italian.
FINIS.
