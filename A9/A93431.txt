Some Queries propounded to this professing Generation the people called
Baptists, or any of the Professors upon the earth for them to answer and
heedfully to weigh and consider.












the father in spirit and in truth that which the Devil abode no tin, nor can
get into, and whether he may not get into the outward things and visible things
which is in the deceit yea or nay? or whether their faith will not fail them at
the last, or they do not deceive themselves, that have no surer foundation to
build upon?



















ARE not such to be found among the number of the foolish Virgins that were
shut out, that have a profession but not the possession of what they do
profess that had Lamps but not the oil slumbring and sleeping in the earth
and se^^ed on the lees in security, or may such expect to find any entrance in,
when the Bridegroom comes, that are found in such an estate.





























AND what do you judge of the water that purifieth the heart and washes it,
and purges the conscience from dead works,

IS your Church then any other than worldly and outward, that outward. water
can cleanse it, and are you yet come any further than the outward Court that
dwell in the outward things; when as the true Church,

AND your Church as you call it which stands in the outward washing and so
without is it not full of spots blemishes and wrinckles and many such things,

BUT if you say that John did baptize with water, and many were baptized with
water so did Paul circumcise but what is that to you, you have it by tradition,
sent you then, and said the baptism is one, and who come through this one
baptism by the one Spirit into the one body are one, but who are after the
many baptismes are not in the oneness, neither is there true unity one with
another.



in the light, which you yet manifest your selves strangers unto, therefore
first come to the house and then you shall know the ordinances of the house the
outgoings, and in-comings thereof, for is not that first necessary to be known
or how many things do you make necessary unto life and salvation?



Gods Kingdom is within, which the light within leads again into, without
which the entrance cannot be found.

Or the way to the Kingdom discovered, which is the first thing to be sought
after.

MAny shall strive to enter but shall not be able, such are not turned to the
light who are the unable wherewith Christ has enlightened them, who is able to
save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him, Heb. 7.25. Man's ability is
lost or strength to get in, for whosoever finds the strength he has found
the power of God in which the strength is in which is everlasting strength. And
nene taste of the power of God and receive it, but who believe in the light and
receive it wherewith Christ has enlightened them, who is the true light of the
world, and lights every man that comes into the world, that all through him
might believe and who believe in the light and receive it wherewith they are
enlightened; to them he gives the power, such have the power given unto them,
to them ability is given to enter, and strength to get which is found in the
power that is given unto them who are turned to the light, and it receive which
comes from Christ to whom all power in heaven and earth is given. For in the
fall and driven out state man has lost the power; he has lost the strength to
get in, his ability is lost and is become weak he cannot enter, for the
flaming sword at Edens gate turns every way to keep the way of the tree of
life; so that there is no entrance in, but through the death to the life, to
come to the tree of life. And man's willing and running availes not, his
striving cannot get in, it is only the tender mercy of God availes which is
made manifest in the light of his Son, where the mercy comes to be showed the
light shows it, which lights every man that comes into the world, which is
only able to bring man in again; for man in his willing and running obtains
not, his willing cannot get in but waiting in the light receiving it and being
turned to it wherewith he is enlightened,, he comes to find a grafting in again
upon the right stock juice and body natural, the light shows wherein the
tender mercy of God is found that brings man in again, without his willing
running and striving. Therefore all ye professors disputers and people who
cannot say this you have found, the ter der mercy of God unto your souls, wait
in the light wherewith Christ you has enlightened, and turn to it, that
shows it. Come to the search for he that seeks, finds, keep to the light
which is the eye wherein the tender mercy of God is seen, the light shows
it, whereby the entrance comes again to be found, in the light stand still,
come to stillnesse coolness quietness in your own spirits, out of all heats
buslings and strivings, for that obtains it not, it does not give the entrance
in, stand still in the light, and will nothing that shows the mercy, be
silent out of your own thoughts and comprehensions or reachings out, and wait
to be gathered in, in the light wherewith Christ has enlightened you, for all
flesh is to be silent before the Lord God, and you kept on the watch waiting in
the light and obedience, thereunto the entrance in again will find which is out
of your own willing and running, and only of God that shows the mercy, which
is showed in the light which will guide your feet into the way of peace, the
peace of God which passes all understanding which neither the world can give
nor take away, the light of the Son of God leads into who lights every man
that comes into the world. And to lead that life to live for ever which is not
the worlds life which lies in the wickedness, or to lead such a life as this
or the other man lives, but to lead such a life as the light wherewith every one
is enlightened leads into; and every one being found doing of the will of God
which is mode manifest in the light of the Son of God, he shall know of the
doctrine, so an entrance shall be ministered into the everlasting kingdom of
the dear Son of God, which light obeying it leads into all godliness and
honesty where the quiet and peaceble life is enjoyed and felt, for who is here
is in the feeling life, feel and see one another in the body and in the life
which stands not in words meats nor drinks but in power, for thy own willing
running and doing to create thee a peace obtaines not, it is the election
obtaines which is in the seed, but to stand still in the light and to will
nothing neither to do but what is required of thee, here is thy first step
unto peace being turned to the light to stand still and see thy salvation, thy
strength is to sit still, to come to stillnesse, believing in the light, for he
that believes, makes not have, for who are in the have, are from the light
which brings the salvation, and so see not the salvation, nor feel the
strength which is found in Christ the light and life of men, and who are here,
feel and see one another in the life, and in the body which is above the
Elements and things below in another body, and here see over the world, and
things that are below, and feel and see all things in their place and order,
out of the forwardness to be doing, striving, speaking, or climbing up in the
beleiving and obedience to Christ Jesus the light and life.

For thou that art out of the peace thy self how can thou bring others into
it? for Gods Kingdom stands in the peace which thou art out of which shows
thou art out of the kingdom where all buslings strivings tossings climbings
heats and colds, upps and downs cease and have their end, which thou art yet
in, and so in the elementary body where these things are, out of the life and
feeling body which brings over these things and sets them in their place; for
if thou give thy body to be burned, and thy goods to the poor, in a voluntary
humility, and yet out of the light and love out of the body, this shall profit
thee nothing, where if not a word be spoken, yet that which is right is felt,
and that which is wrong and out of it is place is seen and felt, for here all
things come to be set aright in their place, where is no schism jar nor
confusion in the body and life, for who are in the tossings are in the unsettled
state, out of the peace, and so short of the Kingdom. For the light which
convinces of sin and evil in the secrets of the heart and conscience makes
manifest what is out of the peace, out of the agreement out of the covenant,
which is to be departed from, and the filthy unclean nature which has been
out from God in the transgression, in which state all man's striving willing
running nor climbing availes not, it cannot enter. But coming to silence
quietness stillnesse to stand still in the light which shows that nature
which has adulterated and transgressed upon which condemnation must pass
abiding quietly in the meekness to be led through the judgment the entrance
comes again to be found wherein the peace is witnessed, which is out of man's
power his willing or running and only in the mercy of God which is tender, the
entrance comes again to be found, so that here is the first step unto peace to
stand still and will nothing, before there be a returning to that which is gone
from to stand still, to come to stillnesse, and to be drawn off from all
thoughts, wanderings, imaginations. Therefore come down keep low in the light,
be low, and so you will come out of your own thoughts and imaginations above,
for to feel the mercy of God in the lowliness meekness and stillnesse of
your spirits which mercy man is separated from in the haughtiness and
loftiness of mind in the driven out state from God in the earth, until be
with the light find his grafting in his entrance in for the light which leads
out of the darkness where is the tribulation and anguish will guide the feet
into the way of peace. And the mercy of God is from generation to generation
toward them that fear him in the fear of God in the mercy of God, but who
are out of his fear are out of his mercy, and the fear of God is to depart
from evil.

W. S.
For man being turned again unto God, in covenant with him, comes again to have
right, unto the things of God, unto all the creatures. As in the beginning
every thing that was made was good and subjected in it is place so in the light
Gods covenant with man: every creature of God is good and nothing to be
refused, mark, but to be received, which God has created to be received of
them which believe and obey the truth.
