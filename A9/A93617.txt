Die Jovis primo Junij. 1643.
THe Special Committee appointed by the House of Commons for the better
expediting of the Affairs of Ireland, now in so great extremity, desire, That
all the Adventurers for Ireland, would meet to morrow morning being Friday the
second of this instant June, in Grocers Hall between seven and eight of the
clock in the morning, then and there to elect and choose out of their number a
Committee, who are to give their Assistance to the special Committee of the
House of Commons, and to take into consideration, all means for a present
supply for Ireland, which will admit of no delay without apparent danger of the
loss of that Kingdom, And they are therefore desired to set apart all other
business, to meet for the promoting of so pious a work.

Rob. Goodwin.
