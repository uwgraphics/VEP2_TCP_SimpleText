A SONG in the LUCKY YOUNGER BROTHER Or the BEAU DEFEATED
Set by Mr. John Eccles, Sung by Mrs Willis, and exactly engraved by Tho: Cross.
^ Relieve, the fair Belinda said, relieve ye Gods a Lovers ^ Pain; relieve a
poor unhap -- py Maid, by faithless Vows, to Love betray'; diyet ^ not, yet not
beloved again. Ah! if to Love: Ah! if to Love, it be a Pain: What is it to be
not Loved again? ^ Till fifteen Parents me obey; then Lovers ^ Sigh and Moan,
and leave us not, 'till they convey, with amorous Sighs our Hearts away: ^ So
that there never our own; own. How wretched are we Women; how wretched are we ^
Women grown! Our Hearts and Wills are never our own; are never, are never our
own: No ^ no, no, no, no, no, no, no, our Hearts and Wills are never, are never
our own: Our Hearts and ^ Wills are never our own; are never, are never our own.
