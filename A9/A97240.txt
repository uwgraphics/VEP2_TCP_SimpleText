(...), ^ new way of Wooing.
A merry conceited Young Man being in company with a Proud, Scornful, Jeering
Less at St. Albones, he taking notice of her person and Carriage, presently
Composes this paper of Verses, as he thought suitable to her deserts; his way
lying to London, threw the song into a Stationers shop, as soon as he found
them, gets it printed for profit, and sends them through England for pleasure;
when the Young man returned back, he presented a Ballad to his Mistress and
departed.

Though London Girls have many Rimes and Catches,
Yet often times they do meet with their matches.
To the Tune of the Zealous Lover, or, A Fig for France, etc.




AS through St. Albone^ I did pass
I Heard a scor^ful C^ckney Less
From London thither came to dwell;
For pride she others did excel,
She often u^^^ to ^o^k and ^eer
Some Young men of Northamptonshire,
Till at the last an honest lad,
Did ^eer this wench and made her mad.
Quoth he, I Am but a simple Youth
Yet I delight to speak the truth;
Obse^ve my Langua^e se^iously
It Is clearly void of slatte^y,
and that you ^ say is very strange,
When Lovers Complements do change,
^or some young me^ praise their sweet hearts
^uch higher than their true deserts*
Then give me leave and i will prepare
My foolish fancy to decla^e*
And set ^orth thy imperfect parts
That never gained young men's hearts;
I never saw Phoenix in my days,
Therefore thy beauty i will not praise
Then prithee ben't so co^ to me
For I am not so fond of thee.
Thy scurvy scornful rouling Eyes
Of my heart never shall make a prize,
Thy beetle Brows and tallow face
Makes young men run from thee a ^ace;
Thy have is like my Sorrels mane
The words I speak are very plain,
Or rather like unto Jane Shore,
Which makes me think thoult be a whore*


WHen thon do smile I think thy lips
Look like a basket full of Chips,
Thou can not smile as Maidens do
When Young men come in Love to woo,
Thy voice is shrill, thy speeches bold
Shows thou will be an ugly scold,
Then prithee ben't so co^ to me
For I am not so fond of thee.
Thy looks at first (...)
I could hate through on (...) fire,
My heart with^ur was i sta^'d
It vexed me wh^^ ^ heard thee named,
No happine^s (...) ^ee
Whilst I was in thy company,
No Lov^ to thee can be allowed
Thou always art so devilish proud,
I will not promise much content
To thee although thou dest consent;
If thou yield to be my sweet heart,
I Will make thee go to Plow and Cart,
And i will whip Lawrence quite away
W^^k's be^te* for thy health than play,
Then prithee ben't so coy to me.
For I am not so fond of thee.
The Ladies that in Court do dwell
gallant Clothes shall thee excel,
They wear rich Sattens fine and ^rave,
And Linsey-Wolsey thou shall have;
No music thou art like to hear
But in the Spring time of the year;
^^tter speak ^^u^h without a Lie
Than promise much and falsify,
Whilst Lovers walk on pleasant plains
(...) my Love through dirty Lanes,
^^ hedches, ditches, mires and bogs
^hear the Music of the Frogs.
Sometimes we will tumble on the grass,
That's pleasure for a London Less;
What say thou can thou fancy me*
Speak or avoid my company.
If thou will yield to be my Wife,
I Will buy m^ Girl a penny Knife,
I Will travel Europe ere I have done
In find my Love a Whistle spoon
A Baby o^some costly Knack,
That thou may keep it for my sake
If thou do slight me in this case
I Will dash m^ shoos about thy face.
If that thou will not yield to me
I Will set my Little Dog on thee*
A Dog with Ladies much in fame
And little Cupid is his name;
If Cupid at thee bark and bite,
He Will make thee Love me day and night,
But if thou can not fancy me,
I never shall die for Love of thee
In our Country there is gallant Girls
That's worth their weight in gold and pearls
Bec^^s^ they are Uertuous Chaste and fair,
(...) London can (...)
With them, when they are right in tune
Their cheeks are like the Rose in June*
O uch a Lass what ere betide
I Will choose to be my loving bride.
Fare well thou scornful Drab quoth he,
Thou never shall entangle me
Pluck off thy patches and the Paint
For thou art but a seeming Saint,
Remember Pride will have a fall,
I speak to scornful Damsels all,
If I have done thee any wrong
Speak now or ever hold thy tongue,
