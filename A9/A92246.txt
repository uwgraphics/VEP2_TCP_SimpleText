REASONS Humbly offered, why the Bill brought in by the Adventurers in the
Fenns should not pass before the Adjournment of the PARLIAMENT.
1. BEcause they bring in their Bill in this straight of time, on purpose that
the wrongs they have, and still do the KING, Country, and many particular
persons, may not be heard.

2. They would entitle the Parliament to the guilt of all the wrongs they have
done the King and Country; and by this short Bill have the bolder face to
perpetuate their Injuries by a longer Bill to be brought in hereafter.

3. If there be any real danger to the Country, the Commissioners of Sewers
being the most ancient and legal Judges, are more likely to apply the proper
remedies for the safety of the Country in general, then A Company of private
persons, whose interest is opposite to the Public.
