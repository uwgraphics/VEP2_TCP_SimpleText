TO THE HONORABLE HOUSE OF COMMONS Assembled in PARLIAMENT, The Humble
Petition of the Ministers of the County of HERTFORD, Concerning
CHURCH GOVERNMENT.
Humbly Shows,
THat Your Petitioners having already received many happy fruits of your
unwearied endeavors, for the reformation of the Church; which with all due
thankfulness they acknowledge; do notwithstanding find that those fruits
have not grown up to that maturity which they expected, for want (as they
humbly conceive) of a settled government in the Church; but rather to the
retarding of their hopes, there be such universal distractions raised in the
minds of men, increasing, and multiplying daily, and posting to such
confusion, as we had rather leave to your wisdoms to judge what the issues may
be, then to represent them according to our fears,

Wherefore Your Petitioners do most humbly supplicate this Honorable House,
to apply Your Wisdom and Providence to the preventing and cureing of these
mischievous evils, by the speedy establishing of Church Government amongst us.

And Your Petitioners shall ever pray, etc. This Petition was the 31 of August,
read in the Honorable House of Commons with very good approbation, and an
Order made thereupon.
Printed at London for I. W. in the old Baylie, 3. Sept. 1644.
