News from FRANCE.
LEtters (my dear friend) as well as kisses mingle souls: Your free and real
correspondence you have retained with me since my arrival into these foreign
parts, having conveyed my heart into thy bosom, and transported thine hither
as it were in a mutual exchange. France is full of the Relation of the English
affairs; with us in Paris there are many discourses of the late battle, but I
believe but a few true ones: though the Malignants and fugitives of our Nation
here cry no the Cavaliers victorious, which we that love our Country hope is
not truth. Here are rumors of Forces which the King of France has in Picardy
at Calice, Bulloigne, and other opposite parts to our English shore, with a
Fleet also in those. Havens. I make no doubt but you have heard of them in
England, whither some conjectured they were to be employed; but I have with my
most industrious care and my best intelligence strived to get knowledge in that
affair, which bona fide I shall impart to you as I have received the notice
from some of good and eminent credit in this Court. It is not unknown to thee
(gentle Will) that Paris and other parts of France have been the constant
Sanctuary, to which our English Delinquents voted so since the Session of the
High Court of Parliament (I mean such as could escape the Island) have
resotted for refuge, as Secretary Windebanke, Master Iermin, and the rest of
those turbulent spirits, that like the fellow that set Diana's Temple on fire
at Ephesus, only to leave a memory though of mischief to posterity, sought to
acquire fame to themselves by their Countries ruin. And these men have with
their utmost endeavors strived to endeare their cause to the King of France,
exemplifying the injustice of their sufferings, and candalizing as much as it is
possible for persons of their spleen and malice, the Intentions and actions of
the Honorable the High Court of Parliament; especially Master Iermin, who by
the means of his acquaintance in the Court of France, where sometimes he was
Ambassador, and by the Commands of the Queen of England, has indifferent
respects, and free admittance into the society of the best there; the King
himself affording him his care very often: To whom he did remonstrate with
much earnestness the affairs of his Majesty of England, intimating how
injuriously they dealt with him here; that he was in a manner expulsed by
violence from his Palace; that his Royal Consort, his Majesty's Sister, the
Queen, was as it were enforced to reside for her safety in the Netherlands:
That his Master the King could not with so much interest challenge aid, or
expect succors from any Prince of Christendom, as from his Majesty, being his
next neighbor, and his brother: That he was for the common interest of Kings,
and their honor, engaged to the cause, being so prejudicial to Majesty, to
have subjects as it were give Laws to their Prince: And therefore hedesired
his Majesty would please to transfer an able Fleet, with good store of
ammunition, and all other military provision, into the North of England, for
the Kings assistance, whom he was confident would make his Majesty ample
retribution for his courtesy, and be ready to serve him in any affair with his
best ability. The King of France (as I was credibly informed) shaping M. Iermyn
this answer; That for his good Brother the King of Englands troubles, he was as
much afflicted as if they had happened to himself; that he could heartily will
that a sudden and fair atonement were made up between the King and his
Parliament, whom he conceived very honorably of; and that he could not
believe so many brave and loyal men of ability and worth as were assembled in
the present Parliament, would do any thing against their allegiance to their
Sovereign, or the peace and safety of the Kingdom; that it was absolutely
affirmed, that King Charles was rather misinformed against his Parliament by
some Malignants, then that his Parliament did either offer or intend any
violence to his sacred person, or diminution to his royal dignity or
Prerogative. That for the Queen his dear Sister, he conceived she went into
Holland for her healths sake, and to accompany her daughter the Princess,
rather then of fear of her safety in England: That for the setting forth of
any Fleet, or sending hither any provisions of War, as the case stood with him,
though he would gladly furnish his Majesty with any assistance in his power,
yet he could no way possible grant his desires, having employment for all his
ships, men, and ammunition; having the King of Spain to enemy in all parts of
his Dominions, being enforced to keep three several Armies on foot against
him, viz. one in Picardy, to secure those Frontiers from the invasion of the
Low Countries; one in Gascony, to repel the attempts of the Biscayners; and a
third in Berne and Languedock, to assist the Catalonians, that had put
themselves into his protection: and that besides he did conceive he could not
with the safety of the amity between France and England send any Forces into
that Kingdom against the PARLIAMENT, which he considently believed were full
of duty and good intentions to the KING: and therefore prayed Master Iermin to
cease any further treaty in that behalf which he could not in honor listen
to, nor withsafety put in practice, the Council of France being not to be won
to give their consents to any thing that might infringe the league with
England. Master Iermines cake being dowe, as the saying is, with this reply,
and that refussall of his purpose, has not, to my best notice, since solicited
his suit, but rests here without much noise. And in good troth, if my bolt may
be hot, in affairs so sarre above my capacity, there is no possibility, had
the French any intentions to attempt ought against the Kingdom of England, that
it should suit to any effect: the army and fleet which was at Calico and about
those parts, being billetted thereabouts merely for the defense of those
Provinces against the incursions of the Walloons, who from their garrisons of
Graveling, Saint Omers, Bapam, Airs, Bethun and Cambray, daily and mightily
infest those frontiers with their parties; and for any ships, they cannot peep:
out of their ports of Bollone, Calico, or Haberdugrave, but the little
Dunkerker has them by the back, who watch all advantages to surprise the
Frenches: and for any of the other parts of France, they are either too remote
from our English coasts, or unfurnished of any cousiderable number of vessels.
Bordeaux and the river of Garoune, which have the most and best ships being
very loath to have any enmity with England, whither they vend their wines,
deriving to themselves, and all the whole Country large annual emoluments out
of their traffic with that Kingdom; and for the ports of France in the
Mediterranean seas, they were very simple that would imagine the King of France
would bring any of his men of war from Marseilles, which consist most part of
Galleys, into our seas, in which they are useless by the long tract of the
Spanish coasts; being they must needs pass the straights; which are constantly
guarded with store of able galleys, both to stop the passages of the Prench and
Turks; so that the malignants in England may as well hope for succors out of
the world in the Moon, as our of any part of Prance; and for ammunition,
especially powder and lead, the frequent and diverse wars here have rendered it
so scarce, that they would gladliet purchase it in England then export it out
of their own Country: this is my conjecture, in which I am certain I have
not drawn my arrow by ill aim, if I hit not the mark. For other news here
in Paris, it is all of the ordinary sort; the nimble witted French Tailors have
brought up a new fashion of doublets, upon whose skirts none shall sit, they
being for their smalnesse scarce discernable, some thirty about a doublet: I
make no doubt you will have it ere long with you in London, and be a la mode de
France: there is rumor here, that the Pope is lately dead, and that there is
like to be a shrewd contention among the Cardinals. The Spanish faction
standing for Cardinal Sp^nola; and the French for the old Popes Nephew. Would
all were peace in England, on the condition all the Conclave of them were at
the gallows, and so dearest Will adieu, and be sure there is nothing more
precious to me then thy love, I being so many ways engaged thy Servant, W. S.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE LORDS and COMMONS Now assembled in the high Court
of PARLIAMENT.
The humble Petition of diverse Inhabitants of the City of LONDON, and the
Liberties thereof.
SHOWS,
THat the present sense of our miseries, and apprehension of inevitable ruin
both of the Church and Commonwealth, make us to become humble duitors to this
Honorable Assembly (the likest means under God for our relief) to consider
our distressed estates, and to provide a speedy remedy for our present and
future evils, earnestly desiring you to weigh the care and judgment of our
Predicessors, who by a known Law, settled and preserved our Protestant
Religion, our Liberties, and Properties, with a right understanding between
King and Subjects, which produced peace and plenty in our streets.

And to reflect with serious thoughts upon our present distempers, violating
Religion by Papists and Sectaries, engaging our Nation into a civil, bloody,
and derstructive war, invading our Laws and Liberties, endangering all our
lives, and utterly disinabling us to relieve our distressed brethren in
Ireland: We beseech you likewise to consider the effects of a continued war, as
the destruction of Christians, the unnatural effusion of blood; fathers
against sons, brothers by brothers, friends by friends slain, then, famine
and sickness, the followers of a civil war, making way for a general
confusion, and invasion by a foreign Nation, while our Treasure is exhausted,
our Trade lost, and the Kingdom dispeopled. These things weighed and enlarged
by your wisdoms, we doubt not will be as strong motives in you to labor, as
in us to desire a speedy Peace, and a happy Accommodation.

Wherefore we humbly crave, that (not lending an ear to any fomenters of
these present wars under what pretense soever, nor remembering ought that may
increase jealousies, or continue divisions between his Majesty and his House
of Parliament) you will speedily tender his Majesty (according to his Royal
inimations) such Propositions for Accommodation, as he may with honor and
safety to the whole Kingdom accept. For effecting whereof, we shall be ready
to assist you with the best and utmost of our abilities, and whilst you
endeavor Peace, we shall send up our Prayers to Heaven for the blessing of
Peace upon you and all that desire it.

FINIS.
