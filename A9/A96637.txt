A LETTER Sent from the Lord WILLOUGHBY of Parham to the Speaker of the House
of Peers pro tempore, to be Communicated to the Lords in PARLJAMENT.
My Lord,
WIth how much zeal, and how uninteressedly I have served the Public, since
the very beginning of this Parliament, as well with the hazard of my person, as
the expense of my fortune, is so well known to your Lordships, the Parliament
and Kingdom, as I need not we are out more time on that subject, knowing my
integrity to the principles your Lordships went upon, to be such as I need not
make a recital of my past Actions to justify my proceedings. For I (who know
my self best) know I am still upon the same foundation I ever was; And as
possitively resolved (by Gods assistance) not to vary from it, what aspersions
soever my Enemies endeavor to blemish me with, or what success my constancy
to those Grounds in the conclusion may meet with. I shall look no further
backward to my late Restraint under which I continued four months patiently,
expecting what could be proved against me by them upon whose Impeachments I
was by your Lordships Committed; but finding their delays very much to exceed
the usual time of proceedings in Affairs of this nature; Upon addresses to
your Lordships I had my liberty, resolving to make no other use of it then to
have retired my self to privacy, not being by some thought longer fit for
public Employment; but whilst I was in preparation for this my intention, I
find my self interrupted by a fresh prosecution of the former Impeachment;
and apprehending the Restraint which may consequently follow, has enforced me
to use means for my Liberty, which I desire may admit of an Honorable
interpretation from your Lordships to

This 6th. of Febr. 1647. Your faithful Servant F. Willoughby.

Printed in the Year 1648.
