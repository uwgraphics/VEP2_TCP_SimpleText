Published according to Order.

LONDON, Printed for Joseph Pots, and are to be sold at his shop in the Old
Bailey near the Sessions house. 1646.

To Lieutenant Colonel John Lilburne.
SIR,
I Had thought, that you, like the generous Mastive, would have passed by, and
taken no notice of the snaps and snarles of such Curs as I am; for so you are
pleased to term me, in the ^9. page of your empty Pamphlet, entitled, Londons
Liberty in chains discovered, where your Ignorance says, that you look to be
vilified, and reproached, as you have been formerly, by such barking Curs as
are S. Shipard, who during the time of your close confinement, nibled at your
heels; but though it was your pleasure, venerable Sir, to bestow an Epithet
upon me, only worthy to be annexed to your own name, to wit BARKING CVR, in so
saying, although perhaps you know it not, Obscurus est tuus serm^; although I,
and the world know, Dicis non aliud, quam merum mendacium; yet herein, you
perhaps bestowed on me not so evil a term as you imagined; for you resemble me
to those harmless currs that bark, yet bite not: wherefore for so saying I am
something engaged to you; but for your own part, you are a man (I had almost
said Cur) that not only bark, but bite too; and, by that means, you have proved
the PROVERB of no validity, which says, Canes qui multum latrant raro mordent,
that is, Dogs that bark much seldom bite: You have bitten many men, Mechanic
men, great men, yea, Peers of the Land, you have bitten the Noble Earl of
Manchester, Colonel King, and others: and you know that Dogs teeth are
something venomous, and if drawing salves be not suddenly applied, the parties
wound, so bitten, will wrancle and fester. You also know, that a Dogs tongue
has the virtue to heal also, with licking the wound, which useful property,
although for ought I know you may so much degenerate from your kind as to want,
yet I rather incline to conceive the evil of your mind will not suffer your
tongue to do that good, for which it was given you: For most men know that you
have wounded and bitten many, but no man can remember that you ever endeavored
to heal any, or to make them amends for your injuries: But to return from
whence I digrest.

Although, as I said before, it pleased you to show from what gentle stock you
came by your gentle term, Curr, yet why have you curtailed and excorciated my
name, saying S. Shipard, when my name is Simon Shepard; I cannot persuade
myself you should be so meanly lettered, as not to have some insight in the Art
of spelling, although you have ere now been found faulty in that kind by Mr
Prynne, and others: I rather think you did it on purpose reserving the meaning
thereof to your self, for what reasons I care not: but Sir by this means I am
fully satisfied concerning a point which Ptolomei averreth, to wit, that from
the benevolent or malevolent positure of the Sun and Moon, at each others
ascending sign, at time of birth, is discerned the love and hatred twixt any
two, and this by your means, without seeing of Lilly: But Sir forasmuch as
hereafter you may again have occasion to use my name, and that you may no more
mistake, in setting down i for e, I shall here insert both your name and my own,
for those that shall read this Letter to judge, I persuading my self it will go
through many hands ere it arrive at yours, you and I will imagine a multitude of
spectators, while we throw the DODOCHEDRON DIE, while we take to pieces, and
ransack our names, and believe it Sir the ANAGRAM of a NAME is worthy of
observation, it often being as useful to certify, as the calculating of a
Nativity; I shall presume first to begin with yours, and afterward shall insert
my own.

(JOHN LILBVRNE) Anagram. Lo J-Burne hie.
Behold the Anagram says (you burn high)
And not alone, you make the Kingdom (f^ie).
Now Sir in recompense of your favorable mitigation, in tearming me only a
barking Curr, whereas if it had pleased you to have been rigorous, you might
have rancked me with your self and Overton, and have said biting Cur,
therefore Deign to accept of an Accrostick on your own name: each letter
thereof placed is as capital form as where you were styled DEFENDER OF THE
FAITH. Pray read.

(An Accrostick Sonnet).
I whilome was a Warrior bold
On Horseback, charged the Foe,
Having men under me inrol'd,
Now ah, it is not so.
Loo now because I Libels framed
In Prison I am laid,
Lions are my Associates (tamed)
Because to much I said.
Unto me Independants Bow,
Reverencing me, as one
Nere would Conformity Allow,
Even as Overton.
Thus much Sir for your sollace and delight. Now Sir I shall insert my own name,
with an Anagram, which if it shall distaste, pardon my ignorance of the relish
of your palate.

(SIMON SHEPPARD). Anagram. No man pries headiness in me.
None ere abused me in this Kind but Thee,
For never no man pried headiness in Me;
Yet cause Thy heady giddiness I blamed
Am I by thee, vile fool, a Cur-dog named.
(Accrostick Sonnet).
Since Thou, O Lilburne, angry art,
In truth, dear Sir, I care not for it,
My mind's not sorry that I framed,
Or that I wrote the Famer's famed,
Nor shall I be, by wisemen blamed.
Shut up Thy Press, and Rayl no more,
Having no matter, now in store,
Except old Statutes for to cite,
Peecing Thy Books, with infinite
Articles, Orders, Proclamations,
Rerages, Damages, Taxations,
Desist from such like fond Relations.
Now Sir although your splenitick humor shall persuade you, the next time you
mention my name, to call me biting Curr, yet, I hope, you will write my name more
properly then before, and say Shepard, and not Shipard: Moreover Sir, I shall
entreat you to take not see that though my weapon has been hitherto a pen, and
not a pike, yet the wise have reported, that a Scholar may sooner become a
Soldier, than a Soldier a Scholar: and although I hope you have Repented of
your Rigorous Proceedings during the time you were a Commander employed to
vindicate a Righteous Cause, yet I wonder how your mind assisted you to twit
the Royal Party (bloody and barbarous I confess) and yet your own conscience
not to whisper you in the ear, and tell you, how cruel you your self were
during the time you had a Commission: I shall instance one tale to you, related
to me by a faithful honest man, whose near friend, one Mr William Hagar,
surprised by your soldiers, as be was walking in a garden; the place I need not
name; I suppose you well remember it, and rifting him to his bare skin, drove
him before them ten miles, til he came in your presence, who were so void of
humanity, that instead of comforting a Distressed Christian, you espying a Ring
on his finger upbraided your soldiers that they took it not off, who replying,
they could not get it off, it having bin so long worn by the party that the
flesh had overgrown it; your counsel to them was this, why then cut off his
finger and all; ah! where then was your Christian Piety, to will so bloody an
act. Sir, I know well you have showed your self a man sufficiently valiant, and
have been an instrument of advancing the Public good, therefore you are the
more to be admired, that you should so horribly revolt and become an enemy to
them who have esteemed nothing too dear, to purchase lawful immunities, and to
promote the Gospel of Christ; and here I cannot but wonder at one passage
inserted in your last book, entitled, Londons Liberty in chains discovered,
where so much you triumph at the Recantation of one White, a Warder of the
Tower, setting forth in Print, that you chose for umpires to take up the matter
those Knights Sir John Strangewayes, Sir Lewis Divet, etc. prisoners in the
Tower, that sometime bare Arms against this present Parliament, and did their
utmost endeavors to impede the settling of that Reformation for which you
fought; by reading which passage the shallowest capacity may conceive, that you
look more then one way and hide two faces under one hood; is there any
followship betwixt God and Mammon, betwixt Light and Darkness? Can you be a
sincere desirer of the Commons Liberties, and yet hold correspondency, and
comply with those that would have enslaved them? May not GOD say to you, as
once to that lukewarm Congregation, Revel. 3. verse 13. Novi te neque frigidum,
^eque fervidum; utinam esses; itaque quoniam topidus es, evomam te ex ^^e meo.
I need not English this to you, for I may suppose you understand Latin, else
you would never have inserted a whole Page of it in your last Book, called,
Londons Liberty in chains discovered, and yet it may be you are as ignorant as
you were some few months since, when you solemnly protested, in one of your
Books, that the Latin tongue was unknown unto you; and this I am moved to think
because that order you then cited was framed to your hand, and you needed but
to copy it out; I much wonder that your wisdom foresaw not the Aspersions
that the divulging of such a passage might draw upon you; but it is just with
God, that those men, which trust so much to their own Abilities (as, I am
confident, you do) should, being left to themselves, discover that of
themselves, which if another should relate, they would be greatly enraged. For
my own part, I wish your release from trouble, with your infranchisement, and I
sympathize of another afflictions, having my self drank of those bitter
waters. But this let the world know with me, Maris Coelique temperiem turbines
tempestate^que, commendant; habet has vices conditie Mortalium vt adversa
secundis, and adversis secunda nascantur, occulta^ utrorumque semina Deus, and
plerumque bonorum, and malorum causa sub diversa specie latent; Storms and
tempests contribute to the clearness of the Heavens, and the smoothness of
the Sea; the condition of Mortals has this property, that Adversities grow out
of Prosperities, and Prosperities from Adversities; God hides from us both the
seeds of the one and the other, and oftentimes the causes of blessings and
evils are covered under one and the same appearance.

And now Sir I hope for the future there will be no more occasion of trouble
betwixt you and me, and I shall hope you will no more vilify me in Print, which
if you shall, my frailty is such, that I shall not so far regulate my passion, as
to sit still and not Answer you. I have hopes this Letter may be a means to
quench that fire your Anagram says you burn in; and not augment it, which if it
shall, I find but what I expect, and what I have lately read, in one of the best
of our modern Poets Master Withers, a man worthy of all honor, yet too much
addicted to your own Fancies, wherefore perhaps you will the more willingly hear
him. Who says.

"But faulty men accused, if still they find
"Their power continue, feel another mind
"Unto their guiltiness, they malice add,
"They grow revengeful, mischievous, and mad:
"Plunge in the toil, strive, strugle, scratch, and tear,
"Rage like a Tigre, roar out like a Bear:
"And are so nettled, that you may behold
"Their guiltiness, before the same is told:
"Yes and by hearing them, ere them you see,
"May know what vermin, and what beasts they be.
I pray Sir read these Verses over again and mark whether the Poet has not
rightly Characterized you, and set forth the nature the world has found to be
in you, in as ample a manner as if he had wrote it of your own Person. I much
admire Sir that trouble and contention so much pleases your mind; you keep the
field continually, and are still brandishing your weapon, I mean the two-edged
sword, your tongue, against some party, or parties; if you should continue in
your critticall course, you will be esteemed the only Momus and Zoilus of the
Age, and the Poets will forget those two others so notoriously known, and
instead of them celebrate your name, which will be for your infinite dishonor.
But Sir now I shall come up more close unto you, and desire of you, if you shall
so please, to show some particular Relations, or some infallible Arguments that
may prove I have dealt Currishly with you, or charge it on my own conscience,
if you can, to the uttermost, if in my Famers famed (the ground of your malice)
I have calumniated you the least, but what is sufficiently evident to all men;
I extracted most of it out of your own Books, I mean the passages you
boastingly relate of your superbious carriage to those you ought to honor and
reverence, I mean the House of Peers; and I confess I was mightily troubled to
see a man do that which was contrary to GODS express Command, and then to make
his so doing known to the world in Print, as glorying in it, which was the true
cause that moved me to Answer to those your Vindicators, the one the Author of
The Just Man in Bonds, the other naming his Pamphlet (A Pearl in a Dunghill);
this was it that moved me to reply, to wit, that I might let those men see,
they stood for his cause, whose actions rather merited an open Recantation,
then a public Vindication; and also that your self might know how much you
swerved from the ways of godliness, and from the obedience God commands you
to yield to your superiors.

And I must tell you Sir, although perhaps you see it not, no man desiring to
know his own imperfections, you have occasioned to the Commonwealth much
vexation, and to the Church of God much trouble: For in a Book, said to be
written by you, entitled, An Answer to nine Arguments, you rayl against the
Church, Ministers, Worship, Government, saying, They are Antichristian, and
Diabolical; and in your Book entitled Englands Birthright, you rail against
the whole State, and exclaim against the political form of Government; so that
you have showed your self an open enemy both to Church and State, what has
moved you to be so, I cannot say, whether it were the overflowings of your
refractory mind, or whether spiritual pride moved you to write and divulge that
which might make you to be famous, and known to be a man walking contrary to
all men; or whether seditious ends persuaded you in hope to be made the head of
some Faction and so to become great by unlawful and irregular courses, while
you thought that to you and your accomplices the giddy multitude would flock in
heaps, and have said, Virifratres, quid agimus, whereunto it is likely you
would have returned and Answer far unlikely to that of St. Peter, perhaps thus,
such and such men are unworthy to govern, pluck them down, such, and such are
the dear children of God, let them be advanced, but what ever your ends were, I
am sure they have produced dire effects. And now Sir, I beseech you let me a
little dispute with you, and now, God willing, I shall prove evidently unto you,
that the course you, and your adherers have hitherto taken, has been both
seditious and rediculous; and I appear to the Censure of the most carping and
critical whatsoever, whether I do not sufficiently prove it.

IN all causes, belonging either to Church or Commonwealth, we are to have
regard what mind the complaining part do bear, whether of Amendment or of
Innovation, your common Objection is why must not men speak of Abuses? Yes, but
with a desire to cure the part afflicted, not to destroy the whole; another
great fault is your manner of complaining, not only because it is for the most
part in bitter and reproachful terms, but also, because it is unto the common
people incompetent and insufficient Judges, both to determine any thing amiss,
for want of skill, and also to amend, which discovers your intent, rather to
be destructive then corrective: Again those very exceptions which you take are
frivolous and impertinent, some things indeed you have accused as impious,
which if they may appear to be such, God forbid they should be maintained, nor
ought it to be sufficient for you to say we will take away this, because a
better may be devised: For we oftentimes conceive amiss when we compare those
things that are in devise with those that are in practice, for the
imperfections of the one are hid til by time and trial they are discovered, the
others are already manifest and open to all: Therefore Mr Lilburne be persuaded
by him whom, I believe, you ranek amongst your enemies, and that for the good
both of your soul and body, to abandon the spirit of disaffection, and consider
that our Savior says It is impossible but that there should be offenses, but
woe be to those by whom they are given: Consider also, that except you and I,
and all men else resolve to agree together as much as in us lies, in all peace
and unity, we shall never enjoy happiness or tranquillity; for by these our
dissentions, we do but, as it were with foolish Priam, pull down our walls to let
in our enemies; to this purpose Mr. George Wither excellently well says, which
his Verses, because they are worthy to be written and to be taken to heart by
all the Commons of this Kingdom, I shall here insert them.

By us together, therefore, and alone
Our duties must respectively be done
According to the Commons interest,
And to the faculties by us possessed,
United, and asunder, with such care
To heed each others counsel, doubts and fear;
And with such mutual readiness to add
All comforts, all good helps that may be had,
And all indearments that may knit together
Our Forces, and our Loves to one another:
That none may come betwixt us, or find way
To mixed with us, our Counsels to betray:
This last will more endanger us then all
The strength of Spain and France, united, shall,
If we prevent it not.
Thus far he, and we undoubtedly shall find his words as Oracles, if the
subjects of this Kingdom agree not together, and live in love and unity, ruin
and destruction will inevitably follow; he that spoke all truth has pronounced,
that a kingdom divided against it self cannot stand; and shall we be so foolish
as to delude our selves with vain hopes, that his words shall not be fulfilled;
if not one jot or tittle which Gods Prophets have said shall fall to the ground,
as God has said they shall not; surely what God himself has said shall be made
good; O! that God would therefore put it into the hearts of all men to
relinquish al Sedations and Factious Proceedings and that each man might
emulate his Neighbor only striving who should become most virtuous

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON Master Lilburnes last Book entitled An Anotomy of the
Lords Tyranny.
NOw Sir you having strugled long both against King, Lords, and Commons, and
now at length are appealed from the Lords house to the Commons Bar, before
whom you cannot want of a Just and Legal Trial, that glorious Court, which both
is and shall be for ever famous for unexampled virtue, mercy, Justice, and all
those virtues necessary to flourish in so glorious a Senate, will determine no
doubt as shall be according to your deservings: yet now your spirits are
elevated and you sing aloud, potior voto, yet it is not the duty of a good
Christian so much to insult over those he has vanquished; for in your Book,
entitled, An anotomy of the Tyranny of the House of Lords, you have a very
triumphant title, and a man may guess by the very contents of it that your
spirits are now elevated to a more ample height then when you received that
Order Die Martis 23. Iunij 1646. you dedicate your Book to the Honorable
Committee appoiuted to consider of the privilidges of the Commons thus.

May it please this Hoonrable Committee in obedience to your Command and Order
the sixth of November. last, I here humbly present you with the Narration under
my hand, which by word of mouth I made unto you upon Friday last of my
particular sufferings since my Commitment by the Lords.

This your glorious title I envy not, but shall desire the Honorable Commit
may find that which so many men have doubted not to reside in you, to wit,
Religion and Fidelity; so that men may repent them of the former ill conceits
they had of your and sing your praises for the furture; yet I cannot but wonder
at the recapitulation you make in your said book, entitled, An Anotomy of the
Lords Tyranny, so often recited in your former Books, to wit, of your stubborn
and uncivil carriage to the House of Peers; I must tell you that in so doing
your glory is your shame, for your standing up for the rights and privileges
of the people, I honor and esteem you, but for your superbious and
unwarrantable carriage to your superiors, I contemn and despise you; the
subjects of this Kingdom have been a long time enslaved, and like foolish
prisoners, played with their fetters; it has pleased God now to open a way to
their infranchisement, O! let it be done in a fair and regular manner; let us
not be so unmannerly to ca^ve to our selves, since there are those appointed
who are both able and willing to to distribute unto us, and let us not, while
we go about to enjoy the immunities of Magna Charta, break and infringe Gods
Commandments. And now Sir, for all your great skill in the Law, I must tell you
that you are very grossly mistaken in one point, which you recite page the 10.
of your Anotomy of the Lords Tyranny.

Where you say; To speak truly, the Parliament are not, nor ought not, to meddle
with causes betwixt party and party, that are decidable at the common law, they
being the supreme Judicature of the Kingdom, and the last refuge to appeal to,
in case of injustice elsewhere, and so may properly be called Judge of Judges,
rather then Judge of particular causes and parties. I pray Sir, let me demand
of you one thing, what renowneth a King more, although to speak truly, he is
appointed by God only, to look after the good of the people in general, to
appoint over them prudent and faithful Governors, and to see them execute
Justice and Judgment; yet, I say, what has renowned them more, then to be so
tenderly zealous over the welfare of their subjects, as to deign to fill up the
seat of Justice with their Persons, and to hear the particular complaints of
each peculiar subject, and indeed Equity commands it should be their constant
employment, but that the possibility thereof is taken away, by reason if it
were so, they must with Moses, sit each day from morning til night, and yet the
people depart unheard; so is it with that great Counsel the Parliament of
England, it is for their everlasting Fame and Honor to decide petty causes,
whereby they shaw their pious care of the Commons happiness; now this sometimes
they leave undone, not because it does not belong to them to hear private
causes, but because they are not able to decide affairs of State, and private
affairs between man and man also; therefore is your Argument waved that it
belongs not to the Parliament to hear private causes. Again I wonder you
should cast such an Aspersion on the Lords as you do in the 14. page of you
Book, entitled, An anotamy of the Lords Tyranny; you say, The Lords have been
the principal instruments to engage this Kindome in a bloody War, That they
set us a fighting to unhorse and dismount our old Riders and Tyrants, that so
they might get up and ride themselves.

Where in saying so, O how much do you mistake your self, it is evident to the
whole kingdom, that the Lords have been the Composers and not the fomenters of
the common troubles, had they sided with the Malignant and Royal partee, I
fear it had not been with us as now it is; but it fares with you as with the
Poet Homer, who never writ well of any, whose actions were never so meriting
that disturbed his Country, so you delight to say the worst you can, and to
Malign any be they never so innocent that have taken part any way against you,
which is in you a very great oversight.

Again, I esteem you very incorrigible, that you should desire as in the
Anatomy of the Lords Tyranny, page 19. That you hope the Honorable House when
they have judged your cause, will not only cause the Lords to restore the
charges you have been at, during the time of your Imprisonment, but will also
grant you ample repairations for your hard and unjust sufferings:

Your sufferings your self occasioned by your sturdy and imperious carriage to
the Lords, who you not only resisted but reviled, and is it any reason that
when a man shall wilfully set fire on his house and goods, his neighbors
should be constrained to make him reparation, I trow not: so is it in your
case, your own obstinacy perhaps has impoverished your state, and therefore
the Lords must make up the breach, and restore unto you the moneys your folly
has caused you to expend; for which there is no reason or the least color:
but you seem to urge some reasons in page the 20. why it should be so, where
you say,

That the Kings constant custom was, to provide lodging, dyer, and to pay the
Fees of all those he committed to the Tower; but the Lords for no cause at all,
having committed you thither, put you to pay all the vast extravagances and
Fees.

Alas sir, the reason thereof might be this, The Lords know what a numerous
multitude of Sectaries were your Idolaters, and they in not providing for your
entertainment in the Tower, would put them to the test, and thereby would give
you occasion to find your friends indeed, from your friends in show, and all
this was for your information in that point, and you have found during your
imprisonment in the Tower, very much accommodation from those of your society;
have neither wanted, as is credibly reported, for either good cheer or wine; a
certain Symptom of their affection toward you, and now it being fairly hoped
by you, as perhaps it may certainly happen, that you shall be delivered out of
bonds: O that God would put it into your heart, to do as you once protested to
the Lieutenant of the Tower, upon condition he would admit you the Society of
your wife and friends, to wit, that you would not write a line in the way of
controversy, which would be for your exceeding great avail, but I fear it
will be with you, as with those superstitious seamen, who being in an hideous
and threatening storm in danger to loose their lives with their fraught, make
solemn protestation to some Saint, that if they will appease the fury of the
tempest, and allot them safe harbor, they will offer up to their shrine large
gifts which notwithstanding when the waves are silent and they arive on shore
they forget to do so; it is to be feared that you when you are again at
liberty, and enjoy those immunities you did ere your confinement, will be the
same man still, and steer a course as irregular as ever before, but I hope the
Lord will guide your heart better, and quiet your troublesome spirit, and unite
your heart to his Church and people, that now at length we may have peace and
union among our selves, and not suffer us while we Tithe Mint and Cummin, to
leave undone the more necessary duties, not suffer us, while we are busied to
find fault, and to urge needless disputations, to forget those duties
necessary for the saving of our souls, that we may no longer be a scorn to our
neighboring Nations, who clap their hands and rejoice to behold our divisions
and distractions, hoping thereby to make themselves Lords over us; but he that
rules the heavens and the earth I hope will so Order the Councels and
consultations of our happy Parliament, that by them as his Instruments, he will
settle his true worship in this Kingdom and cause the Natives thereof to enjoy
peace truth and happiness.

FINIS.
