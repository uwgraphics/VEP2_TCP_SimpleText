An Epistle to Friends.
Dear Friends and Welbeloved in the Lord, unto whom my Spirit wishes peace
and prosperity for Ever;
that as the Lord has made himself manifest unto you, Even so to love him and
abide with him, and their you will find safetye and preservation in all
danger. and you will not Easily be moved or shaken as to the truth which ye
have Received, but will stand firm and sure as upon a Rock, for ye that are
come into the Faith of the Son of, God you cannot easily go from him, or part
with him, for you Remember the time when you wanted him, and the days and
nights of mourning because you could not find him, and now that he has
manifested himself unto you in his Light, and that ye have found him, and
Received him, can you leave him, and forsake him to Embrace the world again, or
can you Run after any airy Spirit into an airy Kingdom, oh no, the true birth
cries my beloved is mine and I am his, with sore travel I have found him, and
in diligent watchfulness I will wait to keep with him, for he is the chiefest
of ten thousand, and his love is better then wine, and so you come to sit under
his wing, and under his shadow, and in his presenc have fullness of joy, and
this is your satisfaction, peace and consolation, and ye cannot go from that to
Join with the enemies temptation, for ye know in whom you believe, and by whom
you are preserved, and in him all live, Even in Christ Jesus, who is the Life
and Substance, and so in him you will be Sollid and weighty, and Savory and
sound in Spirit and mind, and there ye will honor the truth in a clear and
living testimony to Gods glory therefore keep your eye to the watch, that as ye
have received Christ Jesus the Lord, you may walk in him, and abide with him,
for where any suffers loss they neglect the watch, but as you watch in the
light, you will not only see your Enemy but receive power to Resist him, and
in due time to overcome him and seeing the Enemy takes all advantages to work
his work, how then should every one seek after their safety and Security and
stand in readin^ss to resist their Enemy. And how are all concerned to have the
some care one over another in love and tenderness of spirit, for it is a work
well pleasing unto God and they are of good report who are found in it, and
their memory is blessed for ever, and how this care ha^h been manifested in
time of danger; it is witnessed by such as are preserved, for how has the
Enemy endeavored not only to ensnare with the world, but to reign above the
seed in his airy kingdom, and how has some been affected with his work as
having a fair likeness in a show of higher discoveries, and how has the care
of brethren been manifested in this hour of temptation, for in the first
appearance or breaking forth, it dazeled the Eyes of many, and they did not
well know whether it was day or night? or what the Lord would do in such a
sudden change or alteration, and then was the travail of Brethren very great,
as having much care of the body, and their testimony they faithfully published,
and the Lord has wrought mightily unto preservation and restoring, though sum
in their own wisdom may still pleas themselves in that Kingdom, and
notwithstanding the Lord has so preserved, and restored, and given dominion
over the hour of this temptation, and that the work which by the same was
intended is by the power of God prevented, and the true ministry stands, and
the true worship stands, and true unity stands, and the holy Seed reigns,
yet it is needful for all to be watchful, least the same spirit rise again in
another likness or form, for where he has been bruised and foiled he will not
so readily put up his head in that likeness again, but rather form some other
and if the watch be not kept, the same affections may be taken again as before:
for the wrong that any suffer in things of this nature is by the strength of
natural affections, in which the enemy can exercise his Subtilty to deceive,
and where the affections are let at liberty they will be catching at every new
presentation, not regarding the ground from whence they came, and seeing that
the power of the Lord God has bruised him in this appearance, even so to watch
in the power and keep him down with all his formed likenesses, and there ye
will witness the conquering power and overcoming power of God, and the
preservation and deliverance by it. Oh the power of the Lord which conquers and
overcomes the enemy it is a thing which is beyond expression, and yet may have
a service through what is expressed, for thereby weak hands may be strengthened
and feeble knees confirmed, and the poor and needy encouraged to follow the
Lord, and keep the faith without wavering, and so in the power there is a going
forward and a growth in grace and Godlyness, and there love and peace and unity
abounds in he true seed, and the seed goes over the Serpents head and breaks
it, and overthrowes his power and strength and authority, and so the true seed
comes above him, and the birth of God reioyces over him. And so all friends
mind your growth in the power and virtue of God, and keep your testimony in
his life and wisdom, and your judgment in a clear discerning, and let your
love and respect be unto such as faithfully labors in the word and Doctrine,
and give no heed to that Spirit which would persuade you to disrespect
brethren, for though the faith of out Lord Jesus Christ is not held in respect
of persons, as to say to the Rich sit thou hear above, and to the poor sit
thou there at my footstool. Yet who be in the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ
they are taught to respect every person who be in the same faith, for how can
any love one another according to Christ's command, if they disrespect their
persons, for love and respect are mutually joined, but some makes a noise about
men and persons, and would have people cease from man, and not respect persons,
and so would cunningly overthrow love and respect amongst friends, and where
the Enemy sets up this doctrine he brings in envy in stead of love, and hatred
in stead of respect, and they that receive this doctrine into their belief,
they soon go out from the Saints fellowship: for God has clothed some with
his wisdom, and with power from on high has endued them, and in body soul and
Spirit has Sanctified them, and so as Sanctified men he calls them to labor
in his work, and committs the word of Reconciliation to them, and Intrusts the
Gospel of peace with them, and they that ceas from such men and disrespect such
men, they ceas from the power of God and disrespect the power of God, forasmuch
as the power of God speaks in and by them: and so he has set some in the
Church who has authority in his power and wisdone to order and Ed^fie it, and
this is a work beyond gathering and convincing, and who are come into the unity
of the faith, and to the knowledge of the Son of God, and to the measure of the
stature of the fullness of Christ, they dare not disrespect his Apostles and
ministers but has unity with them in their work and Reioyces in their labor,
and therefore beware of such, who wresteth Scripture from its own Intention
according to the mind of the Spirit, and let your love and respect be Enlarged
one toward another; and let your words be few and savory, and in the Light
walk reservedly, retiredly, for where words gusheth forth like water from a
spout, the Tongue is not commanded with the bridle and so is unruly and at
liberty to speak in the abundance of superfluity, and such discourses may
tickle the minds of some hearers and cause them to admire, but as to
Edification there is no Savor in them, and all hold your unity and fellowship
in the light and power of God, and watch over the natural affections which are
Inordinate, that so in the seed you may be kindly affectionated one to another,
and in the seed feels your refreshings together in the manifestations of your
unity. For the inordinate affections only stirs up the Inordinate part, and
thereby begets the affections in others by its Inordinate manifestation, and
though in manifestation it carries a great show of love, yea, seemingly more
then what kindly affectionated friends do manifest, yet it reaches no further
by its manifestation then only the natural affections, but unfeigned love
reaches the seed, and in the unity of the seed friends are refreshed one in
another. And dear friends as concerning the present times; be not ye troubled,
but keep close to the Lord and c^st your care upon him, and live with him, and
so the times will not concern you, neither will you concern your selves with
the times, but mind that which ^oncernes your peace out of the times, for
though you may see distress and calamity depending as to the nation, yet you
are not to concern your selves in it, but to stand still and eye the Lord,
which I am fully ^^rswaded many of you do, and they that do not so they create
their own perplexity in the multitude of their own thoughts, therefore all
keep in the faith and in the love of God and his truth, and follow peace and
pursue it, and then you will be ready to receive what God permittesh in true
contentment, and so be still and quiet and feel Gods peace and blessing, and
there lie down and trust the Lord with all you have, and then if Nation Rise
against Nation and Kingdom against Kingdom, and that there be wars or famine
or pestilence, you are not troubled nor disquieted as other people whom fears
Surprizeth, but rest in your Inward possession and feel Gods peace and
blessing, for when calamity comes upon a nation or Kingdom because of Sin and
iniquity therein, it surprises the sinner with fear because they are guilty and
they are ready to take hold one of another, and yet dare not trust one another,
such is their fear on every side, and if they fall in the Calamity they fall in
their iniquity, and so falls in misery, but such as fears the Lord they lie
down in peace, though in the same common calamity they be taken away, and
therefore it is with me to say unto you as it was said in times past, fear not
little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you a Kingdom and let
this be your full satisfaction, for God has provided better things for you
then what is hear below, yea, he has provided a Kingdom and it is his good
pleasure to give it you, and so your portion and inheritance is above and your
riches above and your treasure above, and there let your hearts be, and let no
man entice you with high words or arguments concerning the truth, for that will
only make you notionall, but keep low in Gods fear and power, and walk in the
plain path, and there the Lord will meet you, and speak comfortably to you, and
with his presence will refresh you, and that is the most desirable thing, and
so in all things be watchful with diligence, that as you have Escaped dangers
past, even so ye may be kept from dangers to come, and then ye will finish a
clear testimony to Gods glory, and receive Etenall life as your reward, and the
Everlasting God of power be with you, in whose love my Spirit Salutes you and
rests with you. Finally my brethren Fare ye well
