A Funeral TEAR, TO THE MEMORY OF THE HONORABLE Capt. James Killigrew: WHO
Unfortunately lost His Life in His MAJESTY's Service, in an Engagement with Two
French Men of War, in the Mediterranean Sea; on the 27th. of January last,
1694/5.

Immodicis Brevis est Aetas, and rara Senectus.

A Funeral Tear, etc.
HOW strangely Nature does Her Treasures heap;
Her Richest Jems, in Cabinets so Cheap!
Her Sparks of Heaven to Walls of Earth disposed,
And the Great Souls in Brittle Clay enclosed:
All Riches have their Wings; even Courage dies;
The Casket breaks, and vanishing Jewel flies:
Weak-Armour'd Life! In Wars destroying Field,
Neither the Champion, nor the Cause, can shield!
In Her whole List, Britannia never could boast
More Hopeful WORTH, nor more Untimely lost;
Not waked, like Sluggards, at their Noonday Sun;
HONOR His Active Morning Race begun:
Such YOVTH did never Manlier Virtue grace,
The Soul of Mars, in an Endimion's Face!
YOVTH, where those equal Charms all smiling grew,
For Cynthia's Darling, and Bellona's too!
Nor in His single Veins such COVRAGE runs;
Sprung from a Race, adopted Neptune's Sons;
Cheer as Their Quarrel, when bold Danger calls,
And Stout, as Their own Floating Castle Walls:
His Brother's FLAG, with His own Streamers, joined;
Hereditary Brav'ry! Comes of Kind!
Methinks, I see His Single dauntless Hulk,
Against His Two tall Foe's o'er-topping Bulk,
Deal round Her Roaring Deaths, in Iron Ball;
Unequal Combat, English VALOVR All:
There wanted so much Odds His Fate to push,
Whom less than Weight, and Numbers, never could crush.
But let not His Insulting Gallic Foes
Too proudly boast this Young cropped English ROSE;
That Vanity Their Sanguine Blushes tell:
He died Their Lillies Crimson, e're He fell.
Nay, such true COVRAGE fought, even beyond Death;
His Thunder still survived, whilst His Last Breath
Does to His Neptune-Successors inspire
His own Great SOUL, that Transmigrating Fire,
That to Their Arms Life, Spir'it, and Vengeance lends,
The hovering Genius His Own Conquest ends.
Nor was this Scene of Albion Glory pent
In Her own Watery Walls, (Her Vassal Element;)
The Tyrrhene Strand did at those Bolts rebound;
Not Thames, but listening Tyber, heard the Sound:
Nor Rome's alone, but Rome's old Rival Shore;
Her Carthage Africk-Coast, the Echo bore:
Nay, even the Neighboring Crescent must Proclaim
The British CROSS's envied Race of FAME:
Such Distant HONOR, her far Thunder hurld,
To drive her Hunted Foes around the World.
Thus his proud Fame, on Her most towering Wings,
At once His Dirge, and Io Paean, sings;
A Fate, that even in Death the Triumph bore:
The great Gustavu's Fall could do no more.
But, oh! hard Fated Laurels! This Young Head
So early lodged in Honor's Fatal Bed!
But when in that sweet Bloom, such COVRAGE dies,
His Mourners are not only Martial Eyes;
The God, and His own Anvil Cyclop-Crew,
Their Tears to that Young Hand, so justly due:
A Hand, that from Their own Great Forge could weild
Their Massiest Bolts; their keenest Lightning held:
But the whole Nine, each Muse, and every Grace,
Must, at this Loss, bedew her Virgin Face.
Yes, If the Humbler Muses feebler Sound,
Is not in all Thy louder Tritons drowned;
Their softest Harmony shall tune Thy Praise,
And chant Thy Name in Her Immortal Lays.
What though in Foreign Tombs Thy Ashes sleep,
And distant Vrns those Envied Relics keep;
Yet still Thy Native Albion Soil alone,
Shall claim thy Birth, a Glory all her Own.
What more Thou leave behind, that larger Claim,
Thy fair Example, and thy fragrant FAME,
More than One single Nation shall supply;
Let the whole World Divide Thy MEMORY.
FINIS.
