The True Lovers Joy
OR, A Dialogue between a Seaman and his Love.
The Maid implores the aid of Charons Boat,
That to the gloomy shades her Soul might float,
With sighs and groans, much weary and oppressed,
At last he heard her moan, and gave her rest,
From all past dangers, and from future harms,
She safe arrived and anchored in his arms.
To a new Tune much in Request.


Maid. HArk Charon come away,
bring forth thy Boat and Oars,
And carry me poor harmless Maid.
unto the Elysium Shoars.

Charon. Who Charon calls in have,
whilst I sit here in pain
I carry none but pure and chaste
such as true Love has slain.
I am come dear soul I come,
thy Face does so incharm me,
Come in my Boat and take thy room,
no wind nor wave shall harm thee,

Maid. Now I am come in thy Boat,
I am a Maid undone,
Sighing my heart is almost broke
for my Love he is from me gone.
Thus as I pass the shades,
i will tell you a mouruful tale,
So full of Sighs as we do pass
shall serve us for a gale.
And so beguiled the time,
i will sing you a true Loves Song,
Mine eyes shall flow a Sea of tears
to carry the Boat along.

OH what is become of those hard hearts
of a Virgin takes no pity,
They Are sailing to Virginia parts,
where Neptune hat built a City.
O Cupid has wounded me,
and has pierced my tender heart,
To call for one whom I loved so dear,
who cares but little for it.
Thus in the shades below,
we will waste the tedious hours,
No gust of winds, but sights shall blow,
the Boat with Charons Oars.

His Answer. Stay gentle Charon stay
and let thy Boat alone,
Row not the harmless Maid away,
that's sits and makes her moan.
For she that calls so fast,
and sights so at thy stay,
A Virgin is as pure and chaste,
as e'ce true Love did stay.
She Is no dear soul for thee,
let not her face incharm thee,
Though room within thy Boat there be
her beauty there may harm thee.
O fair one, if you go;
i am more undone than you,
My heart does equal sorrow know,
and still my Love is true.
The shades you must not pass,
nor mournful stories tell
Instead of sighing gales, alas!
a kiss will do as well.
You Would better stay a shore,
and sing us a true Loves Song,

It is enough, we need no more
to carry his Boat along.
No heart so hard I know,
but would gladly ease your pain,
Else heart let him to Virginia go,
and never return again.
If Cupid has wounded you,
he had wounded me before,
If you love as you say you do,
I love you as much or more.
In Beds of softest Down,
we will spend the short lived nights,
No gust of Wind or sight shall drown
the current of our delights.

Maid. Come gentle Charon come,
and me to shore remove,
The wind dispairing sight did blow,
shall waft me unto Love.
How slow the Boats-man stears,
if he no faster ply,
My Love to rid me of my fears,
shall lend me his wings to fly,
To thee dear Love I float,
finding thee just and true
And bid to Charon and his Boat,
eternally adieu.
Make haste, make have my Dear,
for if thou longer stay,
Thorough the floods without all fears,
my Arms shall make their way.
Welcome my Love to shore
I Will keep thee from all harms,
And thou shall ride for evermore
at Anchor in my arms.
