The ACT of CLASSIS for purging the IUDICATORIES and other places of public
Trust.
AT Edinburgh the twenty third day of January 1649. years. The Estates of
Parliament presently conveened, in this second Session of the second Trienniall
Parliament, By virtue of an Act of the Committee or Estates, who had power and
authority from the last Parliament for conveening the Parliament; Considering,
That forsameikle as the late Committee of Estates, did in the indiction of the
Parliament by their Act of the 27. of October last, declare and warn, as after
follows, To wit, That whereas the corruption of Judicatories of this Kingdom
and Officers of Estate, and others persons in public trust, have been the
cause and fountain from whence our former evil has proceeded. And whereas by
our Solemn Acknowledgment agreed upon by Church and State, We are bound to God,
by our Engagement to England we are bound to them, and by the forecited and
publict Declaration, we are obliged before the World, to endeavor the
purgation and reformation of our Judicatories and places of public trust: And
forasmuch as the foresaids Persons, and all who are in public trust are liable
to the judgment and censure of Parliament for their procedure in their
several places and Offices: Likeas by the Agreement at Edinburgh and
Striviling all such as have been employed in public place and trust, and have
been accessory to the late unlawful Engagement should forbear the exercise of
their places in the mean time; and all Questions are referred to the
Determination of the Parliament: And whereas by the said Treaty, all these who
have been accessory to the said Engagement are challengeable for their said
accession, at the least in so far as concerns their places and public trust,
and the debarring of them from any of these. Therefore the Committee of Estates
does hereby warn and cite all and every one of these who exercised any office,
place, or public trust, or who were Members, or Clerks of any public
Iudicatories, of whatsoever degree, quality, or condition soever, in Burgh or
Land within this Kingdom, and has been accessory to the late Engagement, or
are guilty of the faults mentioned in the Printed Acts of the twenty two of
September, and fourth of October, To compeir before the Estates of Parliament
at Edinburgh the 4. day of January next to come in a peaceable way, accompanied
only with their own domestic Servants, to hear and see the Parliament take
such course, as they in their Justice and Wisdom for the good of the Kingdom
shall think fit, for purging of the Judicatories, and for declaring their
places vacand, and filling them with such as are able and qualified persons,
fittest for the service, and may give most contentment, and as have continued
constant in the Covenant and Cause in the time of trial, And for debarring
them (who are put out) from any other public places, or trust, during such
time, and in such manner, as the Estates of Parliament shall think fit, With
certification to every one of the persons concerned as is abovesaid, and warned
by this public Proclamation, (which the Committee of Estates declares, That
they find it a sufficient intimation in this noture case of so great and
public a backsliding to all persons concerned therein for the effect
foresaid, to be esteemed by them equivalent to a personal citation, or at
their dwelling house upon particular summonds against every one of them) to
compeir before the Estates of Parliament as is before said and compeir not,
That then the Estates will proceed both to determine the general question and
the particular concerning their places and trust, and take what farther course,
they shall think fitting for the good of the Kingdom: And forsameikle, as the
Estates of Parliament being now conveened have ratified the foresaid Act in all
the heads thereof, and by open Proclamation intimate the fame. Likeas they have
made their solemn Acknowledgement of the public sins and beraches of the
Covenant, and their Solemn Engagement to all the duties contained therein,
namely these which do in a more special way relate to the dangers of these
times; And in relation thereto have renewed their Solemn League and Covenant
before God: And by their Act of the 16. of January instant, have disclaimed and
condemned the late unlawful Engagement, as contrary to GODS Word, and a
manifest breach of Covenant and Treaties, as destructive to the Cause and
Covenant, to Religion, the King and these Kingdoms: And is the cause of all the
oppressions and miseries that has followed or may follow thereupon: And
therefore, and for many other reasons, Have annulled and repealed all Acts made
by the late Parliament and Committee of Estates in prosecution thereof, and
have ratified and approven the Protestation in Parliament and opposition made
thereof by this Kingdom against the Authors and Abettors thereafter, and the
late Treaty made at Stirling, debarring all accessory to that unlawful
Engagement from the exercise of their places or public trust, until the
meeting and determination of this present Parliament, unto whom all Civil
questions are referred: And likewise has confirmed the assurance given by the
Committee unto the Kingdom of England that we should not admit any of these
authors or abettors of the late Engagement to any public place or trust
without the consent of that Kingdom against which their Engagement was, as is
more fully expressed in their Answer of the 6. of October last. And whereas the
Estates of Parliament, are not only satisfied of the truth, lawfulness and
necessity of the foresaid grounds, but also are convinced in their consciences
from the Word of God, from the large Treaty between the Kingdoms, and from
their Oath of Parliament, from their solemn League and Covenant, especially
from the 2.4. and 5. Articles thereof, and from sad and dear-bought experience,
That the Malignant dealing of some, and the profane loose walking of others who
have been Members of Iudicatories, and employed in places of power and public
trust has been a chief cause of all the evils both of sin and punishment under
which the Land now groans; And that the Lord requires in his Word, that those
who judge and bear charge among his people should not only be able men, but
such as fear God, hate covetousness, and deal truly. And that it is of special
importance for the remedy of all our evils, and for securing and advancing of
Religion and Righteousness, for keeping a right understanding between the
Kingdoms, and for prosecuting all the ends of the solemn League and Covenant,
and for removing the judgment of God and preventing or disappointing all the
designs and opposition of enemies of all sorts, and for procuting the blessing
of God upon the whole Land, That men not only of known ability, but also of
approven integrity and constant affection to the Cause and good and Christian
conversation, be entrusted in all Iudicatories and places of power and trust,
according to the seventh desire of the Commissioners of the Church given in to
the last Parliament, as so absolutely necessary for the securing of Religion,
which by the Ingagers themselves in the Treaty at Stirling is submitted to the
Church their determination. Which determination anent the qualifications
aforesaids is clearly set down in the 5.6.7.10. and 12. pages of the
Acknowledgement and their Declaration emitted to the world.

Therefore the Estates of Parliament remembering well the Laudable precedents
of the Parliaments, 1641 and 1646 and several others for purgation of the
Judecatories and places of trust; And considering that all persons both by the
common Law, by many Acts of Parliament, and the nature of their place and
trust, are comptable for their proceedings in their several places and trust,
which they have ad vitam aut culpam: And pondering how great a fault it is to
have had any hand or accession in the Inacting, or enforcing, or prosecuting so
unlawful an Engagement, thereby drawing on the Land (so far as they could) the
wrath of God and all the miseries of a War with our Brethren of England,
against Covenant, Treaties, and many warnings from the Kirk, and contrary to
the Petitions from many Synods, Presbyteries and Shires, and the solemn
Protestations of so great a number of each Estate in Parliament: They do in
persuance of their solemn Acknowledgement, performance of their vows to God,
Declaration emitted to the World, and assurance given to the Kingdom of
England, both in the large Treaty, 1641. and late Answer 6. of October last,
and for satisfying of the Kirks just desires for Purgation and Reformation of
our Judicatories, and for determination of this question anent places of trust,
referred by the Treaty at Sterling to their determination, and for deterring
all others in this or subsequent generation, who shall be entrusted with
public power or place from drawing on this nation the guiltless and misery of
inoffensive, unnecessary and unlawful war, and against Covenant and Treaties,
and public warnings from Church Judicatories and Shires, and for encouraging
all who shall be in public place or trust in times of new straits and trialls;
To abide constantly by the Cause and Covenant, and to give evident testimonies
thereunto against all defection and apostacy. The Estates of Parliament upon
this and many other great and weighty considerations moving and pressing them
