A WINDING SHEET For the Rebels at Westminster.

A Grave as deep as Hell, for FAIRFAX and his Army.

With a Whip and a Bell, for the Satanicall hyrelings of the Synod.

By W. R.

To the Junto, whom some call Parliament.
Thus the Fates, do hold it meet,
I should Weave your Winding Sheet:
Arachne, could not better do,
Against Pallas, then I Will act'gainst you.
To the Sectaries, or the Army.
Blood and Fury, Death, and Hell,
All mischiefs, you out-paralell:
(You Saints) yet act the worst of Evils,
You are not Men, but crimson Devils.
To the Factious Ministry, who some call a Synod.
Sell us Religion, we will pay,
To each four Shillings every day:
Geneva Goblins, who to please,
Your lusts, have stolen St. Peter's Keys:
Who Preached down Bishops, and their Rents,
That you might be Non-residents:
Thus I whip You in my ire,
More due then Your four shillings hires.
June 27 Printed in the Year. 1648.

A WINDING SHEET, etc.
WIth your leave, and without your leave Gentlemen of the Houses, though I hold
it besenesse to insult over dying Rebels, (for so you are now in my esteem)
yet I dare affirm it but excellent Justice, to make you sensible of your
villainies, ere you visit the Worms.

And let you know, the utmost of your fate,
Since now Rebellion is grown out of date.
Most high and mighty States, most blessed Reformers, most zealous Saints, most
renowned Heroes, most sanctified Patriots, and most religious Rebels; alas how
comes it about, that of late you are fallen into such contempt, and are
disregarded by your boared Vassailes, the Cowardly besotted English Nation;
what is the reason that your Almighty Power, has so soon left you, and is
looked upon as invalid; how comes it to pass that your Votes, Orders, and
Declarations, are no other then the sport of fools, and the mockery of Men,
who could have Prognosticated, set Wharton aside, that you should so soon
tumble from the top of your greatness; I had thought that no humane strength
could have forced you from your thrones, but it ought to be no wonder to wise
men, for -- Had they ere read, in any History,
That Rebels who combined against Majesty,
Were their ends good, their Prince vicious and Ill;
Had he enslaved the People to his will;
Were all good Laws perverted, were his mind
To lust, ambition, Sacrilege inclined,
And that to remedy, their harsh anoy
Then threatening their whole Nation to destroy.
Some private men took arms against their King
Out of intent, their lost Laws back to bring.
Had they ere thrived in their Rebellious Vow,
Even from the first Creation, until now;
Some might have hoped these Rebels never should fall,
Till they had caused a Ruin general.


Most gracious most famous, and most wicked States, what would you give now
that you had never run your selves so far into your Rebellious laborinth;
you say you fought at first for to purchase a Reformation, I say you fight now
for your heads, see how the sceano is changed, we know that when you first
Convened, you drew your Swords against your lawful Prince, with an intent to
pull down the Bishops, and fathers of the Church, the masters of Order and
Discipline, to the end you might introduce your novell and Soul killing
Independency, by the advancing of the factious mercenary Clergy in their
room, Creatures so flexible, that you might put any stamp you pleased upon
them, such are your hyrelings of the Synod, and in particular, Marshall, Vines,
Nie; Dell, Peter's, Strong, Gouge and the rest of the Apostated Levites, we
know that you wrested the Kings Sword out of his hand, and made your selves
heirs to the Militia, that you might put your bitts and bridles in the mouths
of the People, and then ride at your pleasures; we know that you Declared
against Monopolies, and Ship Money, with an intent in stead of them to set up
your never dying Excize, your Contributions, and free quarter; we know that
you complied with the Scots, only for your own private advantage, and took
their Covenant, only for a cloak, that so you might grow great by their aid
and fool that Nation into a good opinion of you, we know that you are
seemingly zealous, but really wicked outwardly Stoickes, but inwardly Epicures;
we know that you have this seven years, solemnly given thanks for blood, and
cordially fasted for strife and debate, and to conclude, we well know that you
voted no further addresses to his Majesty, in hope that now you had brought to
pass your projections, and that you might proceed to confirm your Anarchy,
and to make your selves a free and absolute State, commanding the Persons and
purses of the people at your pleasures, and for ever to inslave and vassalize
us and our Posterity, and we know that you gulled his Majesty in the I Will of
Wight, with an intent, to secure his Person from the eyes of the People, and
there to murder him at your pleasures.

And because we know this, and to sum up the sense of all, that you are the
most wretched, bloody, barbarous, incorrigible --, that ever met together,
therefore, it is that we now have a firm intention, to disingage you, and in
liew of your worthy acts fairly to cut your threats, and to ceaze on your
estates the incomes whereof we will employ thus:

Your lands which you have forfeited to his Majesty for your Rebellion, shall
be divided amongst those widows, whose husbands you have shot to death, and
hanged for their Loyalty to their King, and to the heirs for ever of Tomkins,
Challoner, Burleigh, and the rest, your goods, and movables, we will
distribute amongst the people, who have this many years, been robbed, and
plundered by you, and your Agents, and this assure your selves, we will not
fail to do and that suddenly, if the ten thousand gallant Soldiers now under
Sir Marmaduke Langdale; thirty thousand Scots, seven thousand under the conduct
of the Earl of Norwich, and Sir Charles Lucas, twenty thousand in London, (who
wait but an opportunity) and ten thousand of French, and English, now with the
Prince of Wales can do it; therefore make up your accounts with heaven
speedily, for both the stars and men have designed your deaths, and the more
to assure you, that I speak truth, as also (that if it be possible) you may be
penitent, I send you this, -- WINDING SHEET.
Traitors, you that have undone,
All order, and Religion:
You that have sold, your God for gain,
And have abused your Sovereign:
Wrap you in this fatal shroud,
No flowers or coffin is allowed:
This sheet is woven of stern ire,
Such as maintains the unscen fire:
Next of vengeance, black and fell,
Such as threw Lucifer to hell:
Next of the rage of God and man,
Such as are threw the Puritan:
Then of the cries, and woeful tears
Of widows, orphans young of years,
Whose fathers grim death ceaz'd upon,
While they opposed Rebellion:
It Is painted with vermillion fraud,
The blood of Strafford, and of Laud:
His Majesty, has tide the knot,
Of this, wherein your names must rot:
Quickly therefore put it on,
And sail to your perdition.


So farewell old Parliament, now I come to you Sir Thomas Fairfax, o my Lord
Fairfax, I should have said, or rather King Tom, the Arch-Traytor of England,
and the Rake-shames under your command, whom you lead about to murder, and rob
the people.

Vile villain, whose name shall be an hissing to Posterity, had it not been
better for thee to have made use of the opportunity, which heaven once put into
thy hands, and have brought the King from Holdenby to London rather then have
followed the luster of Cromwels nose, and cheat him into the Isle of Wight,
did thou not protest at New Market and St. Al-bones, that thou would use
all means, for the Kings restoration, and that thou refusedst to disband
thine Army on such pious grounds, had not thou and Nol private conference
with his Majesty, and did you not pawn your Souls, that nothing should be
acted which should be thought prejudicial to his Interest, and yet afterward
when you were reconciled to the Rebels, who call themselves a Parliament, did
not act against him, it seems the Almighty would not permit you to wipe off
your Stain: but that as you had wickedly begun so you should traitorously
persist, to the end a hatchet may cure the one of the gowt, and an halter send
the other to hell.

And for you of the Army who term your selves Saints, who are a mixed
multitude, a people of all Professions, and of more religions, to whom War is
become a trade, and who never mention Peace when you give thanks for your
plundered diet, we know you are the Scumme of your Nation, you have fought
seven years to dethrone your King, and now you are in Arms to inslave your
selves and your nation, your cruelties and bloody practices exceed, all that
ever wild fancy has yet feigned, while like unnatural Sons, you feed even
upon the entrails of your mother, the Commonwealth of England, do you know
what you fight for, I am confident if you did you would not have been so
stupid, as still to go on in your unheard of outrages, I will tell you; you
fight for to support their greatness who are the most perfect atheists, that
ever were on earth, who have ruinated and brought to nothing, the most
illustrious and flourishing Church, that ever was since the primitive times,
who have no more conscience, then Cannibals, and no more piety then Patricides,
Religion is to them a mere Chimera, and they hate purity, as much as
uniformity, you fight for those who insatiately thirst for Christian blood, and
who make it their chief delight to murder and kill those that are Innocent and
Loyal, you fight for those who implacably hate their dread Sovereign Lord King
Charles the Lords anointed, set over them, by God^ command, and immediate
appointment, who is the most virtuous, moderate, wise, just, and incomparable
Prince, that ever was, whose life they use all means to take away, and would
esteem it their chief happiness to wash their hands in the blood of him and
his posterity, you fight for them who are guilty of the blood of an hundred
thousand Souls, who lost their lives for the maintenance of their monstrous
Rebellion, you fight for those who would fain make themselves a Free and
absolute State, and that done, to prey on all men without distinction, to doom
whom they will for vassailes and whom they will to death, and that they may
maintain their own luxurious riot, and riot amongst their concubines, will at
their pleasures command your money and goods, yea, even to a penny, and to
conclude you fight for those, who when they have accomplished their ends, (as I
hope they shall never do) by your arm, will turn you off, and not own you,
take an occasion to quarrel with you, and turn you to grass without a penny
of your arreares, or so much as thanks, but I perceive that should I use the
most moving Oratorie, that it were possible to invent, or should I give you
never so many sollid arguments, and unanswerably prove my assertions, it were
to as much purpose as if I should talk to mine own shadow, you are tied to your
desteny, in inseparable cords, and indeed it is but Justice, that you and they
should fall together, in a sure confidence whereof thus do I dig your grave,
large enough here, doubt it not to include an Army of such as you are, the
extent whereof is as wide as hell: Come, Treason, murder, Regecide,
And let Sedition be their guide:
Come, lust, Pride, and ambition,
Schism, and Irreligion,
Dig deep even as low as Hell,
Though you fright Pluto from his Cell,
It Is done, now Glemham, Lucas, and
Langdale now in Westmorland,
Norwich, Lunsford, Capell, Poyer,
Roborough, Laughorn, Powell, Dier,
Thrust the Rogues into the pit,
The Kingdom sees, and likes of it.


But now to the linsey woolsey Synod, that compound of the jerkin and the
gown, who preach blasphemy, print heresy, and talk Treason, and yet have not
had the power to do it, though their Directory, taught the people to pray
backwards, and their Catechismes, couzened them of their old creed, was there
ever such a conclave of ridiculous Rabbis as these are, since the time that
Pope Ione was elected, who are so far from being a Synod, of able and orthodox
Divines, duly and lawfully called, by the Bishops, and Governors of the
Church, that they are a thin conventicle of factious mercenaries, whose trade
it is, to sooth up the Rebels in their impious undertakings, and to prove all
paradoxes out of holy writ for 4s. a day, a company of owls, who whoot nothing
but Sedition and Barbarism, who honor Melvils precepts, above the law of
Moses, and prefer Calvin before Austin; desist, desist ye Apostated
Shavelings, in the mean time give me leave, or I will take it to shake over
you, this, WHIP and BELL:
Grave Rabbis, let us have the other story,
Some new found nonsense Directory:
You Will say the the other is enough,
It Is truth; unless 'twere better stuff,
Alas we know not how to pray,
By your long tail'd, etc.
Lawne sleeves, will make you vomit, we
Have -- out, your Presbytery,
Degenerate, who lie at lurch,
For to orethrow our famous Church.
Behold the Prelates must again,
Sit next unto their Sovereign:
Do not you hear the Organs play,
See you not tapers burn by day,
All Ceremonies pure and holy,
Restored: you laughed at for your folly.


FINIS.
