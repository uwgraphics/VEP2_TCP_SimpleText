A WORD MORE TO Mr. THOMAS EDWARDS Minister, By William VValwyn Merchant.
Concerning the National Covenant.
Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
LONDON, Printed according to order, by Thomas Pain. 164^*

Sir,
Until I perceive the contrary, I cannot but hope that I have prevailed
something with you toward a change of your mind, and that you have begun to
repent you of the evil you have done by publishing your book entitled the
Gangreen: and do wish my whisper had come so timely to your ear, as to have
prevented the second edition, but repentance is never too late, and I earnestly
desire it may be hearty in you, for furtherance whereof, having in my last
forgotten to declare my judgment concerning the National Covenant, wherein
either you are entangled, or whereby you entangle others, forcing such an
interpretation thereupon, as to bind all that have taken the same, to endeavor
the establishment of a compulsive Presbyterian Government: directly contrary to
the whole scope of the new Testament.

To remove this error, if you be conscientious therein: or to prevent the evil
intended, and to undeceive those that misunderstand the Covenant, I shall at
this time manifest unto you in what sense I took the same: conceiving my self
obliged so to do, chiefly in duty to the public, but withal, in due respect
to my own good name, having been questioned by some, how it could stand with my
Covenant, that I should be opposite in my judgment and endeavors to the
government you intended, or be so serious an Advocate for liberty of
Conscience? and I discerned a necessity of doing hereof at this instant of
time, by occasion of a sermon I lately heard at Paul's: wherein all were
supposed to be breakers of the Covenant, that did not insist and be importunate
for such a government, and so much power as the assembly of divines should
think fit, or to that effect; urging with such vehemence of expression, the
pursuance of the Covenant in that sense, with such threats of judgments, and
strong provocations, that I was amazed thereat, and had more feared the issue,
but that I knew those honorable persons to whom he spoke, were endued with
wisdom to discern whose work he did: though I confess it was done so
artificially, as to have deceived the very choicest of men.

The two first articles of the Covenant, are only material to the point in
question: and therefore I shall declare in what sense I took them, not meddling
with any other part thereof.

The first Article is thus, That we shall sincerely, really, and constantly
through the grace of God, endeavor in our several places and callings, the
preservation of the reformed Religion in the Church of Scotland, in doctrine,
worship, discipline, and government, against our common enemies: by this I did
bind my self to endeavor in my place and calling, the preservation of the
Reformed Religion in the Church of Scotland, in doctrine, worship, discipline,
and government, against our common enemies, that is, that our common enemies
shall not in any sort disturb our brethren the Covenanters of Scotland, in the
enjoyment of their Religion, and that form of Church Government which they
conceived most agreeable to the Word of God: my bond being of force only
against our common enemies, and in no measure as justifying or judging of the
form of government, be it Presbyterian, or any other. And I verily believe,
thousands that cheerfully took the Covenant in reference to mutual aid and
assistance of them against our common enemies, did not know or understand what
their Government was, and should they alter their government to some other
form, J hold my self bound in duty to defend them therein against our common
enemy, and do judge the honorable Parliament of Scotland as free to alter, as
for ours to establish what God shall direct them, and the people there as free
to move for the removal of any thing they find prejudicial in their
government, as we are here.

By the next words in the Covenant, I bind my self (in like manner) to
endeavor the reformation of Religion in the Kingdoms of England and Ireland, in
doctrine, worship, discipline and Government, according to the word of God, and
the example of the best reformed Churches: here the Word of God is my
particular and express rule, for the best Reformed Churches may need
reformation, and can at best only minister an occasion of consideration of what
is good in them, and agreeable to that word, but that word is still my unerring
rule, and not reformed Churches. Withal, so far as reformed Churches. are in
use in this case, I could not but esteem that Church the best reformed, where
no coercive power is admitted, where there is no compulsion or molestation for
Conscience sake, or matters of Religion, the word of God being clear and
evident in that point. And truly so far as matters of Conscience and Religion
can be entrusted (for I conceive no truly conscientious person in the world can
absolutely entrust the regulation of his Conscience in the worship of God to
any authority) but so far as it can, in this Nation of ours, I am certain it
belongs only to the Parliament to judge what is agreeable to the word of God
and not unto the Assembly, who were conveened by the Parliament to hear their
advice, but reserving all power of determination to themselves, as no wise
delegable to any others, and God has blessed all their undertakings in a
wonderful manner, by the hands of Conscienscious people, because of their just
and tender regard unto their freedom in Religion, notwithstanding all
importunity to the contrary.

And where in the next place I bound my self to endeavor to bring the Churches
of God in the three Kingdoms to the nearest conjunction and uniformity in
Religion, confession of Faith, form of Church government, Directory for Worship
and Catechism. I conceive my bond is of force only as I understand these or
any of these to be agreeable to the word of God (which I must understand with
my own understanding, and not by any others) and then also my endeavor for
conformity, must be only by lawful and just means, not by compulsion or
enforcement, but by love, light, and argument: which was the way of our blessed
Savior and his Apostles, and in so doing, we and our posterity after us may
live in faith and love, and the Lord may delight to dwell in the midst of us:
for God is love, and he that dwells in love, dwells in God, and God in him:
Nor do I conceive the Conscience of the Parliament to be any otherwise obliged,
then a particular man's Conscience, their votes and results being issues of
particulars, and as they only are entrusted, so I trust and am confident they
will understand with their own understandings, and preserve us in our
liberties, not only as we are men, but (Christians namely, in a liberty to be
fully persuaded in our own minds, in all things appertaining to Gods worship,)
and protect us in the peaceable practice of our consciences, against all kinds
of molestation.

And how strange soever this may seem to you, unto me it seems most equal:
because otherwise, a conscientious man (that of all men is the most precious in
the sight of God, and should be so in the judgment of law and authority) of
all men would be the least free, and most liable to disturbance, for allow unto
such a one all the comforts that this world can afford, and but abridge him of
his liberty of worshipping God according to his Conscience, his life in an
instant becomes burden some to him, his other contentments are of no esteem,
and you bring his gray hairs with extreme sorrow to the grave: for of all
liberty liberty of Conscience is the greatest: and where that is not: a true
Christian finds none.

In the second Article I bound my self to endeavor the extirpation of
heresy, schism and whatsoever shall be found contrary to sound doctrine etc.
Whereby it is supposed and urged that I am expressly bound against liberty of
Conscience; but as I said before: judge not according to appearance, but judge
righteous judgment: by heresy you understand all doctrines that are not
agreeable unto yours: though you are not infallible: by schism you understand
the declining or forsaking the Presbyterian Government or congregations: in
which sense you were a schism from the Prelaticall Church: (but I entreat you
speedily to explain by grounds of scripture what heresy is, and what schism
is: to which you will stand.) Most commonly by heresiy in the covenant, you
understand heretic, and by schism schismatic, and where in the covenant the
word extirpation is applied to heresy and schism, you apply it to the rooting
up of heretics: and shismaticks: but in all this I conceive you are extremely
mistaken.

However, when J took the Covenant I considered what heresy was, and I found
that heresy is not: but where a man forsakes an infallible and known truth,
and professes the contrary, for vile and worldy respects, as may appear by
the words of the Apostle, to Titus, chap. 3. v. 10. 11* A man that is an
heretic, after the first or second admonition reject: knowing that he that is
such, is subverted, and sins, being condemned of himself, so as if I should
know that you in the Bishops time did understand and believe upon sure grounds
of scripture, that liberty of Conscience was due to every Christian, and in
respect unto the truth thereof did plead and suffer for the same: and yet after
that by the justice of this Parliament, you were delivered from that oppression
and molestation for conscience sake: and stated in freedom: if after this, to
gain honor profit or preferment, you shall be so subverted, as to practice the
same oppression toward others, (that differ with you in judgment or way of
worship) as was injuriously inflicted upon you: and strongly and clamourously,
importune for power to suppress conscientious people, this scripture as I
conceive, judges you an heretic: one that sins, and is subverted and
condemned of himself: if your conscience condemn you, God you know is greater
then your Conscience, and will not acquit you. I dare not peremptorily take
upon me to judge you in this sad condition, but that error in judgment, or
blindness in understanding, though very erroneous and gross, is heresy, I do
not believe, but do rather coceive it an invention of some corrupt Clergymen
(to cause hatred among the people about opinions, thereby to divide them in
affection, it being their maxim, (as well as other politicians) divide and
master them,) and to have some color of enforcing their interpretation of
scripture as a rule upon all men, and to punish all opposers. And truly you
shall do a good office if you shall open the eyes o (your friends in this
particular, and not suffer them any longer to judge according to the rule of
corrupt prelates and persecuting bishops, nor continue so violent against such
as differ from them in judgment, but to judge others to be conscientious as
well as themselves, and bear with others, as they would be born withal
themselves: being ever mindful that none are now infallible.

And as concerning schism, I judge it not to be, but where an unpeaceable, and
violent perverseness appears, a disposition imposible to hold fellowship
withal, and he only a schismatic that is such, and not an honest quiet
spirited person, that out of conscience and difference in judgment, cannot
walk in Church fellowship with me, this being also another invention, (as I
believe) of corrupt prelates and persecuting bishops, to find occasion against
Conscientious people, and by vexing them, to make them draw in their yoke,
wherein also you shall do well to open the eyes of your friends, and help them
to distinguish rightly of heresy and schism, that so they may know what they
have covenanted to extirpate, and what not.

And though I should find such heresies and schisms, and am bound by my
Covenant to extirpate them* I must do it in a way that is justifiable, I must
not (as you seem to judge) endeavor to root out the heretics and
schismatics, by banishment imprisonment or death, but by gentle and christian
means: that is, by persuasion, admonition, and information endeavor to
reclaim them, and when that avails not, I am only to reject them: or to hold
no familiar society with them. According to this sense I took these two
articles of our National Coveeant, and so did diverse others that I know, nor
do I discern that I strained the natural or genuine sense thereof in a
tittle. If I am mistaken, I shall thank you or any other by grounds of
scripiure to show me my error, but if this sense be good, you had need to warn
your friends to take heed what they hear, for strange inferences are made from
those two articles in the covenant: but I hope what I have said will satisfy
all considerate consciences, and suffice to acquit me from breach of covenant,
though I earnestly endeavor for liberty of conscience, wherein I am fully
persuaded, the glory and truth of God, and good of all mankind is really
involved; otherwise I would never have moved my tongue or pen in this argument.

And if I shall be so happy by what I have done, as to be an instrument to
reduce you into a charitable demeanor toward tender Consciences, I shall
rejoice more then to see a miracle: for J still remain most earnestly desirous
of your reformation, and eternal happiness.

William Walwyn.

FINIS.
