A POEM In a Letter from a young Lady in Mary's Parish, to a certain young Lady
in Andrew's; for the Loss of her Maidenhead, being a warning to all her Sex.
Pretty Maidens have a Care
Maiden heads are slippery Ware
If you chance them for to Sell
Prize nothing less than two Bum Shells.
MADAM,
TO you I send these Lines
In hopes that you will set forth my Crimes,
To guard our Sex from farther Ills
Which follow them like little De'les,
For I may self has led the Way
And put my Virtue quite astray,
Like Venus I Am a Beauty great
And yet my Maiden-head's at Stake,
Just as she has been before
A little less than Common Whore,
Which is a trade much practiced now
And I my self must sit as low,
The Female Sex can scarce withstand
Temptati^n of the Traitor Man,
For they by their Deluding Arts
Could bend the strongest Females Hearts,
And thus you see I Have been beguiled
And now alas I prove with Child,
By all my Arts I could not hide
Yet Rue and -- I have tried,
Some I have tried stronger than those
And still they do my Work oppose,
Since it is so I Will put a trick
On that ungrateful thing a P -- k,
For it my sorrows first begun
And thus fair Lady sets the Sun.
Your humble Servant RUS
