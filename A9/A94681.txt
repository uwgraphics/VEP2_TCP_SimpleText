royal coat of arms (1603 version) and coat of arms of the city of London To
the Right Honorable Thomas Adams, Lord Major of the famous City London, the
Worshipful the Sheriffs, Master Thomas Foot, and Master John Kendrick, with
the rest of the Aldermen their Brethren:
THese are to give your Honor and Worships to understand: That your
Petitioners have taken notice, of many worthy actions done for the honor of
God, the safety of the King and Kingdom, the preservation of the Gospel and
true religion amongst us, and especially by the strict Keeping of the
Lord's Day: as in reforming the river of Thames, by Watermens not laboring on
the Sabbath Day: and it is an honorable act of them that have done it, which
we ascribe to no other but the Parliament: and some of your petitioners have
been troubled for Trifles, not worth the nominating: like those Pharisees in
the Gospel, which rebuked our Savior Christ Jesus his Disciples for pulling
the ears of corn on the Sabbath Day (yet they themselves ride on the
Sabbath Day in Coaches) as if God saw not that sin, by setting Men and Horse
at work, as Hackney Coach-men (which is their trade) why not Watermen or any
other Tradesmen, if they be suffered? But your Petitioners having experience
of many worthy actions which you have already done, for King, Church, and
State, your loyalty to your King, your piety in desiring an established
Church Government, and for your fidelity to the Parliament (which they
themselves cannot deny) to the wonder of the world, and to the everlasting Fame
of this Honorable City London, that so great a City, so populous, which may,
and (as we have read) has been compared to a petty world, for the statelines
of its Governors, and Corporations therein.

Wherefore, that to everlasting Fame you may be Eternized, that you all (as one
man) will be pleased to move the Honorable Houses of Parliament, that as they
have reformed the ancient river Thames, That they would be pleased to reform,
the almost as ancient renowned City London, of Coaches traveling about the
City on the Lord's Day, which is a higher breach of the fourth Commandment then
that which the Parliament have reformed; by setting the Beasts to work on that
day, which ought (by the law of God) to rest as well as man, and he that does
but rest, little differs from a Beast.

And to take notice how many Churches in London are annoyed by their passing by
in Sermon time, to the great dishonor of God, and to the hindrance of the
hearers of the Word, which is the only means under God of our salvation; And
if not speedily Reformed, it will breed a great scandal on the Parliaments
Reformation, which may be such like words as these, That they could see to
reform Boats; but they cannot, or will not reform Coaches.

This petition has been read in the Ears of a Thousand Citizens of good rank
and quality.
Printed at London for Benjamin Green, and are to be sold at his house in three
leg-Court in Fleetstreet, over against the White-Friars. 1646.
