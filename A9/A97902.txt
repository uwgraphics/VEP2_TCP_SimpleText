To the tune Of the pride of Leister Shire.
The young man's kind reply unto the comfortless Maid,
He grees with his Love in all she has said,
Showing to her a part of his mind,
That he will be always most loving and kind.


Hark, hark, me thinks I hear one speak
what should this Echo mean?
I think it be my own true Love,
my fair and only Dame:
O why should thou, my Philladay,
complain that I am gone,
And know I am the only man,
that loves thee alone?
I am not gone away from thee,
my only hearts delight:
But comfort thou shall find by me,
by day and eke by night:
My own sweet Love, and Turtle Dove,
be not disturbd in mind:
For thou shall find, I will prove kind,
and never change again.
I promised thee for to be true,
and so I will endure,
Though I at first did prove thy heart,
it is good for to be sure,
To prove thy mind, and know thee kind,
for many false there be,
And so might thou, for ought I know,
have proved unto me.
Though I did make a vow to thee,
and pawned with thee my heart,
Yet thou have spoken unto me,
as though thou would depart:
But now I find thee true and kind,
and I the like will be:
Whilst death does part, my tender heart,
I will not part with thee;
All you kind hearts that have true loves,
by me example take:
And have a care, whereto you swears
for the Almighties sake:
Do not goo on as I have done,
to breed a Maidens smart:
But turn in time, in heart and mind,
and ease your true Loves heart.
Would God I never had wronged my Love,
nor been to her unkind:
Then should she have no cause to mourn,
nor be disturbd in mind:
But being it is so, I well do know,
I must unto her go:
And speak my mind, in loving kind,
and ease her of her woe.
Come, come, sweet heart, do not repent,
nor wrestle in despair,
Though I to thee have been unkind,
I Will ease thee of thy care:
For I will prove constant in love,
as always thou shall find,
I will be true, not change for new,
but always will be kind.
Come, Love, let us speak no more of this,
but faithfully let us join:
And look before what was amiss,
I mean for to amend:
Come let us now, perform our vow,
and make no more ado:
But let us join in heart and mind,
and so to Church let us go.
And so these Lovers made an end,
of these their former words:
One loved the other heartily,
not breeding no discords:
In peace I pray long live they may,
and all true Lovers else:
What ere they (...) what degree,
so much is spoke of me.
FINIS.
