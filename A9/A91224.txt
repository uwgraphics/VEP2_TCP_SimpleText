Lo here is the Authors Shadow, pass it by;
These Lines his Substance, will in Part descry.
Gaze not upon his Shade unless to see,
And learn thereby, that all Men Shadows be.
All flesh is Grass, the best men vanity;
This, but a shadow, here before thine eye,
Of him, whose wondrous changes clearly show,
That GOD, not men, swayes all things here below

TO The Right Worshipful his ever Honored worthy Friend, Sir PHILIP CARTERET
Knight, Lieutenant Governor and Bayliffe of the Isle of Jersy.
SIR, Your great Favor and Humanity
To Me whiles Exile, Prisner in Jersy,
Wholly secluded from all Friends access,
Under the angry Frowns of their Greatness
Who sent Me thither, to deprive me quite
Of worldly Comforts; challenge a just Right
To these rude Meditations, which there grew,
And so in Justice are your proper Due.
Accept them than, as a small Pledge of my
Thanks unto You, till Opportunity
And better Days, enable me to find,
Some other means to pay all that is behind.
Your Eternally Obliged WILLIAM PRYNNE.

TO THE CHRISTIAN READER,
SHut up Close-Prisner in Mount-Orgueil Pile,
A lofty Castle, within Jersie Isle,
Remote from Friends, I arrived in Iersy, January the 17. 1637. and received
the Tidings of myenlargement thence by warrant from the Parliament November 17.
1640. the same day of the Month, I there first landed.
near three years space, where I
Had Rocks, Seas, Gardens daily in mine Eye,
Which I often viewed with no small delight,
These pleasing Objects did at last invite
Me, to contemplate in more solemn wise,
What useful Meditations might arise
From each of them, my soul to warm, feast, cheer,
And unto God, Christ, Heaven mount more near.
In which pursuit, I found such inward Joys,
Such Cordial Comforts, as did over-poise
My heaviest Crosses, Losses, and supply
The want of all, Foes did me then deny;
Give me assurance of a sweet Return
Both from my Exile, Prison, and mine Urne:
Revive my cold dead Muse, and it inspire
Though not with brightest, yet with Sacred fire:
Some Sparks whereof rakt up in Ashes then,
I laid aside, for want of Ink and Pen:
But now enlarged by the mighty hand
Of that sweet God, who both by Isa 43. 2. Psa. 66. 12. Ps. 139. 9. 10. Josh.
1. 5. 9.
Sea and Land*
In sundry Prisons, Countries, kept me so
In health and comfort, that I met with no
One day of Sickness, Sadness, Discontent,
In I was first committed Prisoner to the Tower of London, Feb. 1. 1632. where
after two removals to the Fleet for a short space, I remained Prisoner till
July the 27. 1637. and was then removed to Carnarvan Castle in Northwales,
where I arrived August the 5. and was there kept close Prisoner till I was by
special warrant shipped and sent close Prisoner for Jersy, October. the 10. 1637.
where I arrived not till January the 17. following. From whence I departed by
Warrant from the Parliament, November. 19. 1640. and landed at Dartmouth Novem.

(Which I relate, that all may bless his Name
For his great Mercy, and expect the same
Support and Presence of our God in all
Those sharp Afflictions which may them befall,
As I have found, by sweet experiment
To my surpassing Solace, and Content:)
I have blown up these buried Sparks a new,
And here present them to thy Christian view,
(Kind Reader) to the end that thou may be
Refresht with those Thoughts, which refreshed me,
And Steel thy Soul with Faith, Hope, Confidence,
Against all Carnal fears and diffidence,
With that which made Me to expect with joy,
That blessed Enlargement I do now enjoy.
From my long Durance, Censures, Banishment,
Which God has made a fresh, sweet Monument
Of his Almighty power, that all thereby
In all their Troubles and Adversity,
May learn with Faith, Hope, comfort to depend
On God, who in due time Release will send.
Thy Comfort, Profit is all I desire,
Next to Gods glory; Lord, let the sweet fire
Of thy good Spirit by these Lines convoy
Such Flames of Love, zeal, Comfort, Grace, and Joy
Into each Readers soul, that he may see
These Meditations were inspired by Thee.
If any profit, fruit, thou from them gain,
O pray for him, who ever shall remain

A POETICAL DESCRIPtion of Mount-Orgueil Castle in the Isle of Iersy,
interlaced, with some brief Meditations from it is rockie, steep, and lofty
Situation.
MOunt Orgueil Castle is a lofty pile,
Within the Eastern parts of Jersy Isle,
Seated upon a Rock, full large and high,
Close by the Seashore, next to Normandy;
Near to a Sandy Bay, where boats do ride
Within a Peer, safe both from Wind and Tide.
Three parts thereof the flowing Seas surround,
The fourth (North-west-wards) is firm rockie ground.
A proud High-mount it has, a Rampeir long,
Four gates, four Posternes, Bulworkes, Sconces strong,
All built with Stone, on which there mounted lie,
Fifteen cast pieces of Artillery;
With sundry Murdering Chambers, planted so,
As best may fence it self, and hurt a foe.
A Guard of Soldiers (strong enough till war
Begins to thunder) in it lodged are;
Who watch and ward it duly night and day;
For which the King allow's them Monthly pay.
The Governor, if present, here does lie,
If absent, his Lieutenant deputy.
F. H.
A man of War the keys does keep, and lock
The Gates each night of this high towering Rock.
The Castle's ample, Air healthy, and
The Prospect pleasant, both by Sea and Land.
Two boystrous foes, sometimes assault with loss
This Fortress, which their progress seems to cross.
The Raging waves below, which ever dash
Themselves in pieces, whiles with it they clash,
The Stormy winds above, whose blasts do break
Themselves, not it, for which they are too weak.
For why this fort is built upon a Rock,
And so by Mat. 7, 24, 25.
Christ's own verdict free from shocke
Of floods and winds; which on it often may beat,
Yet never shake it, but themselves defeat.
Thus potent Tyrants, whiles they strive to quash.
Christ's feeble members, often Ps. 2. 9. Re. 2. 17. Mat. 21. 44.
themselves quite dash
To shivers, against the Rock Christ, upon whom
They safely founded stand what ever come.
A Rock too high for floods to reach; too strong,
Too firm for fiercest winds to shake, though long
They beat upon it, with a roaring sound,
And blustering storms, to cast it to the ground.
This Castles Mount Orgueil, signifies a proud Mount; or Mount of pride.

Or Make at least a proud and haughty mind.
But though this vice in former times (perchance)

ROCKS IMPROVED, COMPRISING CERTAIN POETICAL MEDITATIONS, Extracted from the
contemplation of the Nature and Quality of ROCKS; a barren and harsh Soil,
yet a Fruitful, and Delightful subject of Meditation.

By WILLIAM PRYNNE, late Exile, and close Prisoner in Mount-Orgueil Castle in
the Isle of Iersy.

Psalm. 18. 2. 31. 46. 2 Samuel 22. 2. 3. 32. The Lord is my Rock and my
Fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my strength in whom I will trust, my
buckler, and the horn of my Salvation, and my high Tower; my Savior, thou
savest me from violence. Who is a Rock save our God? The Lord lives, and
blessed be my Rock, and let the God of my Salvation be exalted.

Psalm. 40. 1, 2, 3. I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me,
and heard my cry: He brought me also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
clay, and set my feet upon a Rock, and established my goings, etc.

ROCKS IMPROVED. Comprising certain Poetical Meditations, extracted from the
contemplation of the Nature and Qualities of Rocks; a Barren and Harsh Soil,
yet a Fruitful and Delightful Subject of Meditation.
THE PROEME.
WHen from the lofty Mount-Orguil.
Castle I epsy
The ragged Rocks, which round about it lie;
My Working thoughts begin from thence to raise
Some Psalm. 77. 12. Psalm. 19. 14. Psalm. 143. 5. Psa. 104. 34.
Meditations, to their Makers Praise,
And mine own Profit: which my heart may warm,
Yea mount to Heaven, and vain fancies charm.
Meditations of the first Rank, Parallelling Christ and Rocks together.
ANd first, the Rocks do lively represent
A complete Image, full of sweet content,
Of Christ our Rock; since that both They and He
In Name and Nature fitly do agree.
Are they called Rocks? So he in sacred Writ
A 1 Cor. 10. 4. Psalm. 18. 2. 31. 46. Ps. 28. 1. Ps. 31. 3. Psa. 42. 4. Ps. 62.

31. 2 Samuel 22. 2. 3. 32. 47.
Rock is styled, in these regards most fit.
1.
The Stony Rocks no other Father know
But God who made them, from whose Psalm. 148. 5. Ioh. 3. 3.
word they flow
So Christ (both God and Man) no Father knows
But Ioh. 5. 17. 18. Ioh. 8. 16. 18. 19. 28. 38. 41. 49. 54.
God eternal; from whose Loins he flows
By such a Ioh. 1. 14. c. 3. 16. Act. 13. 33. Heb. 1. 5. c. 5. 5.
Generation as exceedes
Men's shallow Thoughts, and in them wonder breeds.
2.
Rocks are the Mat. 7. 24. 25. Luke 6. 47. 48.
firmest ground whereon to lay,
And found such buildings as shall not decay.
But last and stand in spite of Floods, Storms, wind,
Which may beat on them, yet no entrance find,
So Isa. 28. 16. Mat. 16. 18. 1 P^^. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Psalm. 118. 22. Act. 4.
11. 1 Co. 3. 11. Ephesians. 2. 20. 21.
Christ's the only Rock, the tried stone
On which the Church is built: On Him alone
Our Souls so safe, fast, firmly, founded lie,
That they shall stand for all eternity
Unshaken, undemolisht, maugre all
The Mat. 7. 24. 25. c. 16. 18. Romans 8. 35. to 39. 2. Pet. 1. 10. Psalm. 125. 1.
2 Cor. 4. 7, 8, 9. 1 Cor. 10. 13.
Storms, Floods, Winds, that on them beat and fall
Through Men or Devils Malice: Happy they
Who on this firm Rock, all their buildings lay.
3.
Rocks yield the sweetest Psalm. 81. 16. Deuteronomy. 32. 13.
Honey, Men to feed:
The 2 Cor. 1. 3. 4, 5, 6. Psalm. 71. 21. Cant. 2. 5. Isa. 40. 1. c. 51. 3. c.

sweetest honey comforts, Joys proceed
From Christ our Rock, Men's drooping souls to cheer
And sweeten all sour Crosses which they bear.
4.
All precious Stones, and Jewels Rocks do breed:
All Gemmes and Pearls of Grace from Ioh. 1. 16. Rev. 3. 18. Col. 2. 2. 39.
Christ proceed
The first, our Bodies deck, but for a space;
The last, our Psalm. 45. 9. 13. 14. 1 Pet. 3. 3. 4, 5. 1 Timothy 2. 9. 10. Cant. c.
1. to 8.
Souls, with an eternal Grace.
The first, in Man's eyes are a lovely sight;
The last in Gods eyes makes us shine most bright.
O let us then, these Jewels only prise,
Which make us Ezech. 16. 8. to 15. Cant. 2. 1. 2. c. 4. 1. 2. etc. c. 5. 1. to

comely in Gods sacred eyes.
5.
The richest Mines of Silver, Gold, Tin, Lead,
Brass, Copper, in the wombes of Deuteronomy. 8. 9. Ioh. 28. 2.
Rocks are bred:
Whence not dug out with pains, they useless lie
And none are bettered, or enricht thereby.
Thus all the Mines, and Treasures of Gods Grace
Are Col. 2. 2. 3. 9. Ioh. 1. 15. 16 Ephesians. 3. 8. 18. 19.
hid in Christ, as in their proper place.
Yet none do happy, rich, or wealthy grow
By these hid Treasures, though they overflow;
But those who take much Prove. 2. 3, 4, 5 Mat. 13, 44, 45. 46. Rev. 3 18. c.

pains to dig them thence
With Prayers, Tears, Faith, Hope, and Patience.
O let us then be ever drawing Oar
Out of our Rock Christ, in whom there is such store
Of richest golden Mines, that all Rev. 3. 18. c. 22. 17. Is. 55. 1. 2. 3 Ioh.

May there their Souls, and Bags for ever fill.

The purest, best, and pleasanist waters spring

To Man and Beast, whose Thirst they quench and stay,
Their bodies bathe, and wash their filth away.

the Rock in wilderness
Whence streams of waters gushed to redress,
And quench the Peoples Thirst, when Moses Rod
It smote, and pierced by command from God.
(Yea every Rock whence Cristall waters spring)
A lively 1 Cor. 10. 4.
Picture was, and is to bring
Our Rock Christ to our Minds, and to present
Him to our eyes, and Hearts with great content:
From whose pierced Hands and side with Nails and Spear,

Streams of precious Blood, and waters clear
Did sweetly flow, Gods wrath to quench, allay,
His peoples Thirst, and wash their sins away.
We need not then a Crucifixe, to bring
Christ to our Minds, since every Rock and Spring
That flows from thence, does in more 1. Cor. 10. 4. Gal. 3. 1.

Present Christ and his Passion to our Eyes;
Let Papists then behold their painted sticks;
Each Rock to me shall be a Crucifixe,
As 1. Cor. 10. 4.
God has made it: and shall teach me more,
Than all the Pictures of the Roman Whore;
Which are mere Psalm. 135. 15. 16. 17. 18.

Rocks have no outward Isa. 2. 21. Ezech. 26. 4.

To make them lovely. Isa. 53. 2. 3. Psa. 22. 14. 15. 16. 17. Isa. 52. 14.
Scripture is express
That Christ our Rock had none, whence most Isa. 53. 3. Mark. 9. 12. Ps. 118.

Him whiles they view Him but with carnal Eyes.
And yet as Rocks, though ragged, vile and bare
In outward form, contain within them rare
And precious Jewels, Stones, Mines, of all Kinds;
So though our Rock, Christ, unto carnal Minds
In outward show seems base; yet in Him lie

Christ defends his Church and feeble Sheep,
Against Devils, Tyrants, Wolves; who else would sweep
Them clean away, and speedily devour,
If not protected by his Mighty Power.
O give Him then the praise of this sweet Grace
Who thus preserves us safe in every place.

Rocks often times Harbors make for Ships to ride
In safty both from Pirates, Storms, winds, Tide.

Rocks are too Hard, on which to sleep secure:
And they must Mat. 24. 42. c. 26. 41. Mar. 13. 37. Luke 21. 36.
watch, not sleep whom Christ keeps sure.

Rocks in, or near the Seas, and waters are;
And do their heads, most part Ps. 40. 2. Ps. 61. 2.

Enforce them to Him, to protect and free.
Them from the Evils which they fear and flee.
And then no place so sweet, safe, delicate
As this our Rock before left desolate.
But yet as those who unto Rocks do fly,
Not out of love, but mere necessity,

Rocks humble are, and never upwards tend,
Mount, swell, but Exodus 15. 5. Nah. 1. 6.

So Christ our Rock, did Mat. 11. 29 Phil. 2. 5. 6. 7. 8. Joh. 6. 15. 16. Ephesians.
4. 9. Heb. 2. 7. 9. Zech. 9. 9.
humble and abase
Himself, but never sought high state or Place;
Moving from Heaven down to Earth below,
To quench all Pride, and make men humble grow.
Who then dares swell with Pride, or Haughtiness
When Christ, Himself did thus so low depresse;
Though Phil. 2. 5. 6. 7. 8. 1. Tim. 6. 15. Rev. 17. 14. c. 19. 6. Deuteronomy. 10. 17.

Nay second Person in the Deity?

Sea, Land, nay Heaven may the better Ken.
And with delight see farther, and far more

As rap their souls, and make them sick of Love.
Thence they behold all Earthly things below

And very small when viewed thus from on high.
24.
When Pro. 30. 19.
Serpents upon Rocks do creep or glide
They leave no tract, way, steps, that can be spide.
When that old Serpent Satan crept upon
Our Rock Christ, with his strong Temptation,
He Mat. 4. 1. to 10. Lu. 4. 1. to 10. Ioh. 14. 30. Heb. 4. 15.
naught prevailed, and no print, step, trace,
Of him or his Assaults on Him took place.
25.
When Christ our Rock for forty days and nights
Had fasted, then the Devil Him incites
To Mat. 4. 2. 3. 4. Luke 4. 2. 3. 4.
turn stones into Bread, Himself to feed;
Which He denide, though then he bread did need:
Yet of his tender Mercy to Mankind,
And their poor souls, which are with hunger pinde,
He daily turns a Rock (Himself) to Joh. 6. 32. to 64.
Bread
Of life, wherewith their hungry Souls are fed.
Yea, rather than his chosen, Bread shall need,
The Rocks and Stones their Souls shall fat and feed,
Nay feast with those sweet wafers, which their Mind,
By Psalm. 77. 12. Ps. 143. 5.
Meditations does within them find.
Let then our Hearts be right we need not fear

Since every Rock and Ston's a Magazine
To feed, store, feast them still with Bread Divine.

When God himself of his abundant Grace
Showed forth his glorious Presence, and blessed Face
To Moses and Elias; he them placed
In Exodus 33. 21. 22. 23. 1 King. 19. 9. to 16.
Clifts or Caves of Rocks, and there them graced
With this grand Honor, Him to view. When we
Gods sweetest Mat. 3. 17. Joh. 1. 18. c. 6. 46. c. 14. 7. 9.
Face and Presence long to see,

Within the Clifts of our Rock, Christ's pierced side
(Which these Rocks do but 1 Cor. 10. 4.
figure,) the sole place
Wherein we may with Comfort view Gods face.
O let our Souls in these Clifts dwell and stay,
Where God his Joh. 14. 7. 9. 2 Cor. 5. 19. 20.
Face and presence does display,
In such sweet manner, and such lively sort,
As will our Souls with Love and Joy transport.

Rough ragged Rocks and Stones, cause Men to Isa. 8. 14. 15 Luke 2. 34. To. 9.

fall
And stumble on them; yea, often times withal,
Themselves to bruise, maime, break, and hurt so sore,
That they expire therewith, and rise no more;
Thus Christ becomes to many a wicked one

Some Deuteronomy. 32. 13. Job. 29. 6.
Rocks of flint yield softest oil, to swage,
And supple hardest swellings, when they rage.
Heal wounds, and Ulcers; supplest Oils of Grace,
Which Ezech. 11. 19. c. 36. 26.
soften hard Hearts in a little space;
Mat. 11. 28 Psalm. 41. 4. Mal. 4. 2. Rev. 22. 2.
Assuage our Pain, our Aches, wounds, sores cure,
Proceed from Christ, a Rock most firm and sure.
Lord give us store of this soft Oil, that we
Our Hearts made soft, our wounds quite healed may see.
29.
The Mines and Treasures which in Rocks hid lie,
Isa. 2. Z.
Exceed Man's search and full discovery.
The Sacred hidden Treasures which do dwell
In Christ our Rock, are so Ephesians. 3. 8. 10. 19. 20. 1 Cor. 2. 9. Col. 2. 3.

Vast, boundless, endless, that they far exceed
Saints largest thoughts and in them wonder breed.
O let us still contemplate more and more

To fill our Souls with sweetest joys, and make
Them for the Love of these, all else forsake.

Rocks are most Patient and do not Job. 6. 12. Jer. 23. 29.
complain
Cry, stir, though Tempests, Seas, Winds, Axes, Rain,
Nay Sledges be at upon them, and them bruise,
Break, hew, cleave, pierce, cut, lance, and much misuse.
So Christ our Rock, endured Isa. 53. 7. Mat. 26. 63. c. 27. 12. Act. 8. 32. 2
Pet. 2. 23. Heb. 12. 2. Rev. 19.
patiently,
His Cross, wrongs, sufferings, Death without all cry,
Complainte, resistance; like a Sheep before
Her shearer, which does never bleate, stir, roar.
O let all Christians now at last from 1 Pet. 2. 19. to 25. Rev. 12. 12. Romans
13. 10. Jam. 1. 3. 4.
hence
Learn to bear crosses with like Patience.
31.
The Mat. 7. 25. Luke 6. 47. 48.
Floods, winds, storms against the Rocks often beat;
They still exposed are to Cold, or Heat:
Sometimes the Seas surround and drown them quite
And often the ice and snow them hide from sight:
So Christ on earth 1 Pet. 2. 22. 23. Heb. 2. 9. 10. 18. c. 4. 15. c. 12. 2.
Matthew. 4, 2. to 10. c. 27. and 28. Mar 15. and 16. Luke 23. and 24. Act. 2. 23.
to 37. c. 3. 13. to to 22. c. 4. 26. 27. 28.
assaulted was with winds;
Floodes, Tempests, Heat, Cold, Crosses of all Kinds,
Which for a time did hide, immerge, at last,
Quite over-whelme Him, till the Storm was past.
What Christian then can think himself Joh. 15. 20. Mat. 10. 22. 23. 24. 25.
secure
From Storms, Winds, Floods, since Christ did them endure?
32.
When Christ gave up the Ghost, the Mat. 27. 51
Rocks did rent,
The Death of this chief Rock for to lament:
Yea, to bear witness of his Deity,
Who though he died, made 1 King. 19 11. Nah. 1. 6.
Rocks in pieces fly.
That Heart is harder, worse than Rock or Stone,
Which Christ's Death cannot rent, nor cause to moan.
Yea every Ezech. 22. 14. c. 36. 26. c. 11. 19. Luke 24. 32. Isa. 13. 7. Ezech.
21. 7. Jer. 23. 29.
Rockie Heart must melt, rent, fall
In pieces, when Christ shall it shake, smite, call
By his Almighty Hand, or voice; which make
The hardest 1 King. 19. 11. Josh. 2. 11. Amos. 9. 13. Nah. 1. 5. 6.
Rocks and Hearts to melt, split, shake.
Lord let the Thoughts of thy Death quite relent
Our Rockie Hearts, and move them to repent.
33.
Rocks Job. 6. 12. c. 14. 24.
seldom rot, corrupt, or putrify:
Act. 2. 24. 31. c. 13. 34. 35. 36. 37. Psalm. 16. 10.
Christ rotted not, whilst he in Grave did lie;
That so he might our rotten Corpse thence 1 Cor. 15. 42. 43. 52. 53. 54. 55.
56. Phi. 3. 21.
raise
Free from corruption, Him for aye to praise.
O fear not then, though we return to dust,
Christ at the last Romans 6. 9. 10. 1 Cor. 15. 42. 43. 52. to 57.
will scour off all our Rust;
Dross, and Corruption; and our Corpse restore
To such a State, that it shall dye no more;
But live in endless Glory, and excel
The Joh. 13. 2. Phil. 3. 21. Mat. 13. 43. Dan. 12. 3.
shining Rays, which in Stars, Moon, Sun, dwell.
34.
Rocks though they drowned be, appear again,
And fixed in their Places still remain:
So Christ, though Dead, and laid in Grave, arose
Again the Mat. 26. 6. 7. Mar. 16. 6. 1 Cor. 15. 4. 5. 6. 12. to 23.
third day, yea to Heaven up goes,

Has fixed his Throne for all Heb. 1. 8. 12. Psalm. 145. 13. 2 Pet. 1. 11.

Here shall this ever-living raised Rock

reign amidst his chosen Flock.
35.
Our Rock Christ being dead entombed lay
Within a Mar. 15. 46. 47. Mat. 27. 60. Luke 23. 53.
Rock; where He grim death did slay.
We, Dust and Earth, when dead, to Genesis 3. 19. Eccles. 3. 10.
them return:
But our dead Rock, a Rock had for his Vrne:
Which Him received, and habor'd even when,
He Slain, and quite Isa. 53. 3. 14 c. 4. 11.
rejected was by Men.
O Rocks of Flesh, and Bowels, which first Mat. 27. 51.
rent
Themselves, His bloody Passion to Lament!
And then Him in their Bosoms lodge, and placed,
When men Him slew, forsook, and most disgraced!
O men (more Jer. 5. 3. Ezech. 3. 5.
hard than any Rock, Flint, Stone,
Who never, pity, feel, regard, bemoane
Christ's cruel Death and Passion; nor receive
Him, when the Rocks rent, and Him House-roome give!
O let us learn from hence, how hard, unkind,
Ingrate we are to Him, who still shall Joh. 1. 10. 11. Mat. 8. 20. Luke 9. 58.
Job 24. 7. 8.
find
More pity, harbor, love, from Rocks than we,
Until our Hearts by Grace relented be.
And let this Thought our Hearts of Rock now thaw,
And Floods of bitter Tears out from them draw.
36.
In fine; when we consider that Mar. 15. 46. 47. c. 16. 1. 2. 3. Mat. 27. 60.

Christ lay
Intombed in a Rock; yet the third day
Rose up from thence: it makes each Hole and Cave

And points us out the Job. 17. 1. 13. Psalm. 88. 3. 5.

In endless Bliss, where he does now remain.
Let these sweet Speculations ever cheer

Thus Barren Rocks unto a pious Mind
May fruitful prove, if it 1 Cor. 10. 4.

When they in Name and Nature thus express

Meditations of the second Kind, comparing Rocks and Sins together.
Again, Me thinks, the Rocks do typifie,
the nature of those Sins which in us lie.
1.
For first, all Rocks exceeding Pro. 27. 3. Zech. 12. 3. Isa. 32. 2.
Heavy are,
To those who them upon their shoulders bear:
Yet Light, not pondrous to their proper place:
So, to all Hearts renu'd with saving Grace
All sins more Ps. 38. 4. 5. Job 6. 3. 4. Mat. 11. 28.
heavy than Rocks are, and seem;
Though stony hearts them light and easy deem. Zech. 12. 3. Dan. 2. 34. 35.
Prove. 27. 3. 2^. Chron. 25. 12. Ps. 137. 9. Eccl. 10. 9. Josh. 10. 11.

2.
Rocks press and bruise Them sore on whom they lie,
And for mere anguish make them Roar and Cry.
Sins do so too; when God does once awake
Men's souls, their Pressure makes them Psalm. 38. 1. to 11. Ps. 32. 3. Ps. 22.
1. Joh. 3. 24. Ps. 88. 1. 2. 3.
roar and quake.
O then beware of Sins, which Mar. 11. 28. Psalm. 38. 8. 2 Samuel 24. 14.
bruise, oppress
Our souls, and work naught else but their distress.
Rocks sink, and bend still Exodus 15. 5. Neh. 7. 11. Jer. 51. 63. 64.

Tending to Psalm. 9. 17. Psalm. 55. 15. Pro. 5. 5. 2 Pet. 2. 14. Isa. 24. 24.
Hell the Place to which they go:
Each day they sink men lower than they were,
Till by degrees they them to Hell downe-beare.
Oh then betimes shake off these Heb. 12. 1. Amos 2. 13. Rev. 18. 21.
weights, which press
And sink our Souls to Hell, without redress.
4.
Rocks Exodus 15. 16. 1 Samuel 25. 35.
cold, hard, dead and senseless are; Heb. 3. 13. Ezech. 3. 7. Ephesians. 2. 1. 2.
c. 4. 18. 19.
Sins make
All such, within whose Hearts they Lodgings take:
Beware then how such Guests we entertain,
By which our Souls are deaded, 2 Chro. 25. 12. Isa. 8. 14. 15. Psalm. 141. 6.
Zech. 12. 3.
hurt and Slain.
5.
Rocks make men often to stumble, slip, and fall;
And break their Bones, Limbs, Necks, often times withal:
Sins Isa. 8. 15. Jer. 18. 15. Isa. 24. 20. Jer. 8. 4. 12. c. 25. 27. c. 50.
32.
do the like. If then we would be free
From Slips and Break-neck-falls, we must them flee.
6.
Rocks are Isa. 2. 21.
deformed, horrid, barren, vile;
And so are Isa. 64. 6. Ezech. 16. 3. to 40. Pro. 13 5. Genesis 49. 4.
sins, with all whom they defile.
These make Men ugly, filthy, Steril, base,
And all their Glory, Beauty quite deface;
Yea, change them into Ezech. 21. 25. c. 22. 27.
Monsters, wolves, dogs, swine;
Nay Joh. 6. 70. 71. c. 8. 44. Act. 20. 29. 2 Pet. 2. 22. Rev. 22. 15.
Fiends incarnate. O then Sins decline!
7.
Where Exodus 15. 16. Job 18. 4. c. 28. 9.
Rocks once fix their Stations, they remain;
And none but God can move them thence again:
So Sins once settled in Men's Hearts, there Jer. 13. 23. Romans 7. 18. to 25.
Zeph. 12. Jude 10. 11. 12. 13.
stand
Fast centred, till Gods own Almighty hand
Expel them thence. O then let no Sins lie
Upon our Souls, but out them presently,
Lest they should Heb. 3. 12. 13. Ephesians. 1. 1. 2. 3. c. 4. 18. 19. Romans 1. 23. to
29.
settle; for if once they rest
Within them, they are hardly dispossessed.
8.
Rocks are Jer. 5. 3. Mat. 7. 25. 26. Job 41. 24.
exceeding hard to batter, break,
Mine, pierce, demolish. So let all Men speak,
And they must say, that Jer. 13. 23. Ephesians. 1. 19. 20. 1 Cor. 9. 27. Romans 7.
18. to 25. Heb. 12. 1.
all Sins are so too,
We ruin, break them still with much ado.
He who does think his Sins with ease to quell,
Shall never tame, nor from him them expel.
9.
Rocks make their Dwellers Obad. 3. 4. Jer. 21. 13. c. 49. 16.
fearelesse, and secure
Of Foes or Perils, and to think all sure:
Sins Job 12. 6. Isa. 28. 15. 18. Deuteronomy. 29. 19. 20 Judge. 18. 7. 10. 27.

do the like to those that in them dwell;
Who fear no dangers till they sink to hell.
O then beware lest Sins make us secure.
No State's so ill, as that which seems most sure!
10.
All Rocks are Jer. 5. 3.
blushlesse, shameless, impudent;
Sins are so too, naught can then daunt, relent.
And by degrees Men's Hearts, Brows they so Jer. 3. 3. c. 6. 15. c. 8. 12.

That they no Sin, Blush, shame, disgrace can feel.
Take heed then lest Sin, first, us shameless make,
Then Senseless, Graceless, fit for Hells dread Lake.
11.
Rocks, stones 2 King. 3. 19. 25.
good grounds often spoil, and quite deface:
So Ezech. 18. 24. 26.
sins good men deprave, mar shame, disgrace.
12.
Rocks, Stones in fertile Soiles them Isa. 5. 2. 2 King. 53. 19. 25. Mat. 13.
5. Mat. 4. 5. 6. Lu. 8. 6. 7.

And naught will spring, or grow there, till men take
Them thence: So Rocks and Stones of Sin decay,
And make Men 1 Pet. 2. 1. 2. Jam. 4. 1. to 12.
fruitless till removed away.
No fruits of Grace will ever grow, or sprout
Up in them, till these Stones be dug out.
13.
Great Rocks Ezech. 24. 7. 8. Rev. 6. 15. 16. Numb. 23. 9.
apparent are to each Man's eye,
And all both far and near may them epsy.
Great Sins in all, in 2 Samuel 12. 10. 11. 12. 14. Exech. 16. 36. 37. 38. Isa.

Whence Ezech. 24. 7. 8.
Scripture says, they are on Rocks Tops set,
And do in 1 King. 13. and 14. and 16.
others worlds of Sins beget.
Let all, but Great ones chiefly, all Sins fly;
Which though kept close, will yet 2 Samuel 12 1. 12. Psa. 90. 8 Eccles. 12. 14.

But by strong hand, much cost, pains, sweat, strife, care,
Long Seige, and Easts, by which they starved are,
And forced at last for very want to yield,

They must bestir them who its Forts would win.

And drown those Souls which on them dash or hit;
Not in Sea-waters, but in Lakes of fire,
Where they shall ever feel Gods scorching I Will.
17.
Instruct us then, O Christ, our Rock, to shun
All Sins as Rocks; and not on them to run,
For fear of ruin, and still give us Grace
To fly these Rocks of Sin in every place,
With greater care than Act. 27. 29.

Those noted Rocks, which thousands have destroyed;
Not once presuming to approach or hit
Against such Rocks; as others Souls have split.

Mirth, Pastimes, Pleasures, (where we least suspect,
Or fear a danger) most souls still have wreckt;
Teach us these Rocks to see, and then to fly
With chiefest care, and them not to come nigh.
Yea, since no Sea so fraught with Rocks can be,
As this whereon our Souls sail toward Thee:
O Shield us from these Rocks by thy great Power,
Which else will Split and Sink us every hour:
That so we may at last arive secure
In Heaven's blessed Port, where Joys for aye endure.
Meditations of the third Sort, suiting Rocks, and Gods Elect together.
BEsides, these Rocks present before our Eyes
The State of Gods Elect, in lively wise.
1.
Rocks fixed are, Job 18. 4. Mat. 7. 25. 26.

With every Wind, Storm, Tempest: Even so
Gods Chosen Sheep with Romans 8. 35. 36. 37. 38. 39.

Adhere to Him in all their Troubles, Smarts:
No Storms, Winds, Crosses, Changes can remove
Them from his Word, Son, Spirit, Truth or Love:
When Joh. 6. 66. 67. 68. 2 Pet. 1. 10. 11.
Troops of others shrink, and fall away,
They cleave to him as to their only Stay.
2.
Rocks many Mat. 7. 25. 26.
Winds, Storms, Tempests undergo:
And do not all the Psalm. 34. 13. Act. 23. 22. Psa. 73. 14.
Saints, whiles here, do so?
3.
Rocks meekely bear and suffer Storms that fall,
And never fret, rage, or repine at all:
Gods Psalm. 39. 2. 9. 1 Samuel 3. 8. 2 Samuel 15. 25. 26. 27. c. 18. 4. to 14.
Saints without all murmur, fret, or cry
Their Crosses, Losses bear most quietly;
Submitting unto God, whose Providence
All bitter Potions does to them dispense.
4.
All men on Mat. 7. 25. 26.
Rocks may safely build and rest:
And of all trusty friends, the Saints are best.
On 3 Ioh. 5. 6. Prove. 17. 17. c. 18. 24. Joh. 15. 13.
whom we may all times with trust rely,
And to them in all Dangers safely fly.

Poor,
In outward State; but seldom beg at door.

Yet though Rocks Outsides be but base and rude,
They richest Mines within their wombes include:
So though Saints Outsides be but ragged, base,
Within them Jam. 2. 5. Psalm. 45. 13. Ephesians. 3. 19. Phil. 1. 11. Col. 1. 9. 10.

So Gods Elect, though vile whiles that they lie
In Natures Quarries in deformity;
Yet hew'de out thence, squared, polisht by Gods Grace,
And laid in order in their proper Place,

rich Temples wherein God does dwell,
And do all other structures far excel,
In worth, and glory: Lord thus square, and lay
Us in these Sacred walls, which last for aye.

Rocks for the most part lowly are and meek:

Saints are so, and no high places seek;
In this vain world; where they dejected lie
Till God advance them to the Starrie sky.
9.
Rocks Kingdoms, Islands guard and fortify
Against raging Seas, Floods, Storms, and Enemy:
Exodus 32. 11. to 15. Jam. 5. 16. 17. 18. 2 King. 2. 12. c. 6. 2. to 24. c. 8.
9. c. 20. 6. Genesis 28. 23. to 25. Act. 27. 24. 2 King. 13. 14. 28.
Saints holy Lives, and frequent Prayers ar
States surest Guards; Forts, both in Peace and war;
These Shield-off Judgments, Foes, Plagues, yea Gods Ire,
Which else would wast, and scorch them worse than Fire.

And who but Christ and Saints can Isa. 61. 1. c. 4^. 1. 2. 2 Cor. 1, 4. 5.
Comfort bring
To Sinne-sicke Souls, and those who feel the Sting
Gripes, Torments, Flames of Hell and Conscience?
Or bind up broken, hearts, and chase from thence
All fears and horrid Terrors? Which an Hell
On Earth often make in those wherein they dwell?
Hence all such wounded Souls do ever fly
To 2 Cor. 1. 4. 5. 6. Act. 9. 10. to 20.
these for Comfort in extremity:
Since no ungodly wretch can cheer, or ease
A Sinne-sicke Soul, nor aching Heart appease.
11.
Rocks most despised and neglected are,
As worthless Creatures: Thus Gods Saints often fare
1 Cor. 4. 9 to 13. Heb. 11. 36. 37. 38. Mal. 3. 14. to 18.

Though of Mankind the only Pearls, Stars, Grace.
12.
Rocks hurt no Ships, Boats, Men, but such as Act. 27. 29.
hit
Themselves against them; and so break or split:
So Gods Elect do never hurt, break, quash
Any, but those who 1 King. 13. 4. 6. Act. 9. 4. 5.
wilfully rune, dash,
Bruise, break, themselves against them; who must check?
And blame themselves, not them, for this their wreck.

God first ingrav'd his Sacred Laws upon
A Marble Rock Exodus 24. 12. c. 31. 18. c. 34. 29. Deuteronomy. 4. 13. c. 5. 22. c.

Not brittle Glass, soft Paper; that they might

On hardest Rocks; Saints stable Jer. 31. 33. 2 Cor. 3. 3.

They Time survive, and gain eternity.
The two first Stony Tables whereuopon
God stamped his Laws, broke, lost were long agon:
These harder Tables of Saints Hearts remain,
And in them Gods blessed Laws for aye retain.
Lord, I my heart a Ezech. 11. 19. c. 36. 26.

Therein thy Laws, from which it may not swarve.
And since it shall out-dure the firmest Rock,
O, this rich treasure ever in it lock!
Yea, make each Saints Stone-Heart the Treasury
Of thy sweet Laws, for all eternity.

1 Pet. 1. 1. 2. Heb. 11. 36. 37.
Dispersed here and there, where hid they lie
In secret Corners in obscurity;
Driven from Country, Lands, House, Home, by those

Rocks burnt to Isa. 33. 12.

And Stones of his Church here on Earth together,
And keep out Errors, Sects that would it sever:
Yea, sent to barren Soiles where grew no Grace,
They make them Act. 26. 17. 18. Romans 1. 13. c. 15. 18. 19. 20. Col. 1. 6.

Meditations of the fourth Class, sampling Rocks, and Rockie Hearts, with
ungodly Men, together.
YEt more, me thinks Rocks represent to all
Man's Rockie Heart, and Nature, since the fall,
In some Respects, wherein they well agree
With Stony Hearts; from which God make us free.
1.
Rocks are exceeding Jer. 5. 3.
Shameless, Impudent;
Naught will them daunt, or cause for to relent.
So men of Stony Hearts, have Jer. 3. 3. c. 5. 3. c. 8. 12. Ezech. 2. 4. c. 3.
7.
Brows of Steel,
Faces of Rock, which no blush, shame can feel.
No shameful Sin, Convictions, or Disgrace
Will daunt, or cause them once to hide the Face.
It is their Phil. 3. 19.
glory to be void of shame,
And vaunt of that which does them most defame.
2.
Rocks show no mercy, but to Josh. 10. 10. Judge. 9. 53. 54. Zech. 12. 3. Luke
13. 4. 2 Chronicles. 25. 12.

And break, bruise, tear, crush, all they do oppress.
No Cries, Parts, Virtues, Merits can assuage
Their cruel Projects, nor divert their Rage.
O let me rather fall into the Paws

Bears or Lions, than an hard Hearts Jaws.
3.
Rocks make those Isa. 47. 2.

grind,
Press, bruise Gods Chosen, till they be refinde
From all their Husks of sin, and made meet Food
For Gods sweet Palate, to their greatest Good.
4.
Some Rocks burnt in the Furnace harder grow;
And naught but Deuteronomy. 8. 9. Job 28. 2.
Steel, or Iron from them flow:
Which serves to break, hew, polish, fit, and square
Rude Rocks and Stones, and Stately piles to rear:
Gods fiery Furnace Rockie Hearts makes more
Isa. 1. 5. 6. 2 Chro. 28. 22. 23.
Hard, and obdurate than they were before;
Yea all its scorching Heat the which they feel,
Serves but to turn them into harder Steel,
Or Iron; for to break, hew, polish, pare
The Rocks and Stones which God lays in the rare
And choicest Buildings of his Church: whose walls
Are Exodus 1. 12. c. 4.
built, not rased, with these hard Iron Malls.
And Tools of Steel, though they no Act. 8. 21.
Part nor share
Have in the Temples which they help to rear.
5.
The most mischievous Instruments of war
Wounds, Bloodshed, first from Job 28. 2. Deuteronomy. 8. 9.
Rocks extracted ar;
As Canons, Muskets, Bullets, Sword, Bills, Spears
With other weapons, where with Man kills, tears,
Torments, Maimes, Stabs his Brother in despite,
As if he did in naught but Blood delight:
So from Men's Stony Mat: 15. 19. Genesis 6. 5. c. 8. 21. c. 27. 41.
Hearts first flow and spring
All Mischiefs, Murders, Wars, Sins, each ill thing:
These were the Artists which did first invent
Each bloody, murdering, warlike Instrument;
The Shops in which they forged were, the Arms
That weild them still, and work a world of Harms.
O cursed Hearts of Rock from whence do flow
All Evils, Mischiefs, woes we hear, see, know!
Lord free and ever keep us from such Hearts,
Which are the Cause of all our Sins, Ills, Smarts.

Rocks make those in them Obad. 3. 4. Jer. 21. 13. 14. c. 49. 16.

From fear of Danger: Stony Hearts are sure
To make all Is. 47. 7. 8 9. 10. 11. c. 5. 19.

Rocks are Job 41. 24. Jer. 23. 29. Nah. 1. 6. Jer. 5. 3.
exceeding Hard; and sooner broke
Than squared or polisht with the Axes stroke:
Men's Stony Hearts so hard and flinty are,
That all Gods Axes, Judgments Isa. 1. 5. 2 Chronicles. 28. 22. Exodus 5. to 13.
Jer. 5. 3. c 2. 30. Isa. 9. 30. Amos 4. 6. to 14. Romans 2. 4. 5.

Them to his Rules, nor cause them to amend,
And sooner break than rent, or make them bend.
He who in hardest Exo. 31. 18. c. 34. 1. 4. 29.
S^^^es of old impressed
His Sacred Laws, upon a Rockie Breast
Cannot ingrave them: Lord what Hearts of Flint
Have Men, whereon thy Laws can make no Print!
Naught but Christ's blood these Ezech. 11. 19. c. 36. 26. Jer. 32. 39.
Adamants can thaw
And square them to the Models of Gods Law.
8.
No heat of Sun or Furnace Rocks will melt,
But harden rather, and their Heat's not felt:

Sunshine Mercies, and his sweetest Grace;
His fiery Furnace, and his frowning face,
Men's Rockie Hearts will neither warm, relent,
Affect, melt, change, nor move them to repent.
9.
Most Rocks are Ezech. 26. 4 Amos 6. 12.
barren, yielding naught for Back
Or Belly, that Mankind or Beasts do lack:
Man's Ezech. 11. 19. Math. 13. 5. 6. 20. 21. Mar. 4. 5. Luke 8. 6.
Stony Heart's as Barren: no good Thing,
No Fruits of Grace, Faith, Virtue in it spring.
10.
Thorns, Thistles, Judge. 8. 7. 16.
Brambles, Weeds of Rocks often grow;
All Stony Hearts with these, still Heb. 6. 8. Romans 1. 24. to 32. c. 2. 4. 5.
overflow:
Fruitful in nothing, but those tares of vice,
And sin, which bar them out of Paradise.
11.
Rocks Deaf and Senseless are of good, and ill:
Hard Ephesians. 4. 18. 19. 1 Timothy 4. 2. Proverb. 23. 35. Deuteronomy. 29 2. 3. 4. Isa. 6.
9. 10. 2 Chronicles. 36. 15. 16.
Hearts are so, and neither can, do, will,
Gods Word, Law, Works regard, Hear, understand;
Nor, fear his angry; kiss, his soothing hand.
12.
The fiercest Storms, Mat. 7. 25. 26.
Winds, Waves, on Rookes do dash:
Gods Deuteronomy. 28. 15. to 68. 1. Sam. 5. 7. 2. Chron. 21. 19. Ezech. 14. 21. Mich:
2. 10. Heb. 10. 29.
Sorest Judgments Stony Hearts do lash:
And though they seldom feel Gods stroke or Curse;
This nothing Mends, but Ephesians. 4. 18. 19. Romans 2. 5.
makes their Case far worse.
13.
The pleasant Showers, Drops, Dewes that on Rocks light.
Make them not fruitful; nor in better plight:
But glide away forthwith, not sinking down
To make them Mellow, good, or sin to drown:
So Rockie Heb. 6. 7. 8. c. 3. 13. 8. Mat. 13. 5. 6. Isa. 28. 10. 13. 2 Chro.
36. 15. 16. Jer. 23. 3. 4. c. 35. 15.
Hearts, though they receive the rain,
And frequent showers of Gods blessed Word; remain
Still Barren, Hard, and Senseless; naught will stay
That drops upon them, but all slides away
That Is Good or Sacred; only Floods of Job 15. 16.

Sink down with speed, and freely enter in.
14.
None craggie Luke 8. 6. 13. Amos. 6. 12.
Rocks will Till, Plough, Plant, or Sow;
Their Labors lost who do it, naught will grow.
Obdurate Hearts few use to Plough or Till

15.
Rocks blunt, and hurt the edge of Tools that smite,
Or square them for good uses; yea in spite
Their Chips and Shivers dash against the Eyes,
Face, Shins of those that hew them. Lo the guise

Who check their sins, and hate them as their Foes.
Yea, let their Pastors in their Ministry
But touch their Sores, into their Face they fly:
So zealous are they for those Sins, which end
In hell, when they will not Gods cause defend.
O that our zeal for God were half so much
As for our darling Crimes, when Men them touch:
Then would we let them Psalm 141. 5. Psalm. 139. 23. 24. Prove. 8. 9. c. 29. 25.
strike, wound, lance, yea Slay
Our dearest Sins; and thank, not them gainsay.

So Romans 2. 4. 5. c. 1. 23. to 32. Ephe. 4. 18. 19. 2 Pet. 2. 20. 21. 22.
Rockie Hearts are Cold, and lumpish still
To all that good is; prone to naught but Ill:
No Love, Heat, zeal to God within them flame;
His Cause they will not stir in for Love, nor Shame:
Their Thoughts, Minds, Cares are fixed on Phil. 3. 18. 19.
things below,
And never upwards Soar to view, mind, know
The things above; unless some Isa. 26. 11. 16.
sudden Fear
Of Death, Hell, Danger up them scrue or rear
Against their Wills: which past, to Earth they hie
With greater poyse, and there still grovelling lie.
17.
Rocks Hab. 2. 19.
Dumb and silent are: So Hearts of Stone
For good Discourse have neither Tongue, nor Tone
Sitting still Isa. 56. 10. Job. 15. 3.
Mute like stones without voice, sense,
When any fall to godly Conference.
18.
Rocks Ezech. 26. 4.
bare and naked are; whence all may spy
Their Nakedness, and gross Deformity.
All Stony Hearts, are Ezech. 16. 3. to 15. Rev. 17. 18.
naked, poor, and bare;
Their Bareness, vileness, wants exposed are
To all Men's view; till Christ's rich Robes of Grace
Cloth or Adorn them, and these wants deface.
19.
Rocks Livelesse are; and Stony Hearts are Mat. 8. 22. Joh. 5. 25. 19. Ephesians.
2. 1. 5. c. 5. 14.
Dead;
No life of Grace was ever in them bred:
Yea, all who now draw breath, must shortly Heb. 9. 27. Psalm. 89. 48.
dye,
(Who knows how soon) and dead as Rocks shall lie.
20.
Rocks till by force they broken be, and slit,
2 Chronicles. 2. 2. 18. 1 King. 5. 17. c. 7. 9. 10. 12.
Hewd, polisht, for all Buildings are unfit:
Thus Rockie Hearts till God them Ezech. 36. 26. Joel 2. 13. Hosea 6. 5.
rent, hew, square;
To build his House, Church, Temple, useless are.
21.
Rocks make Men Isa. 8. 14.
fall and stumble, to their Pain
And Hurt: That Romans 2. 5. Ephesians. 4. 18. 19.
Rockie Hearts do thus, it is plain;
Since all our Slips, Falls, Bruises, Sins proceed
From Stony Hearts, which make us take no heed.
22.
Rocks Act. 27. 29.
Shipwreck those, who do too near them sail;
And sunken Rocks to split Ships most prevail:
Thus Rockie Hearts unless we from them fly
Will Romans 2. 4. 5. Ephesians. 4. 18. 19. 1 Timothy 6. 9.
wrack us all; but yet especially
When neither Felt, nor Seen: for then we run
With full-saile on them, and are quite undone.
23.
Rocks feel no Burdens, weights that on them lie;
So Rockie Hearts do never Ephesians. 4. 18. 19.
sigh, groan, cry
Under the Weights and Burdens of their Crimes,
(Though Psalm. 38. 4. Matthew. 11. 28. Job 6. 3.
heavier than the Sands a thousand times)
And why? because they never feel their poyse
Till it them sink to Hell, and quite destroys.
24.
Not all the Men on Earth, with all their Art
Can make one Rock, or Stone; much less an Heart;
But only Joh. 1. 3.
God himself: yet Men alone
Are the Psalm. 95. 8. Exodus 8. 15.
Creators of all Hearts of Stone,
Not God: O wonder, that Men should create
Naught but Hard Rockie Hearts which God does hate:
Such Hearts can none else but Men, Fathers call,
Which sink still downwards, till to Hell they fall.
25.
O then when ever we a Rock shall see,
Let these thoughts to our Minds recalled be:
Yea, ponder what Old Ezech. 11. 19. c. 36. 26. Psalm. 51. 10. 17.
Rockie Hearts we have
By Sin and Nature: then New, soft Hearts crave,
With fervent Prayers, Groans, Sighs, Tears; so we
Our Hearts of Rock, to flesh transformed shall see.
And if we find, feel, know by signs most sure
Our hearts thus changed, and made soft, and pure;
Let us for ever in Word, Deed, Life, Thought,
Extol and (y) praise Him who this Change has wrought;
Keeping a narrow Act. 2. 46. 47. Ephesians. 3. 20. 21.
watch both night and day,
Over our cheating Hearts; for fear lest they
Should by degrees freeze, or grow Heb. 3. 13. c. 12. 15. Prove. 4. 23.
hard again,
Yea turn to Rocks, and so for aye remain.
26.
Sweet Jesus Ezech. 11. 19. c. 36. 26.
take our Stony Hearts away,
And give us hearts of flesh, we humbly pray;
And of all other Plagues, from us avert
This as the greatest, an obdurate Heart.
And since of all our Parts Thou do require,
Seek, prize our Prove. 23. 26.
Hearts most; grant us we desire
Such broken, contrite tender Hearts, as may
Delight Thee most; and never from Thee stray.
Such Hearts Thou only can Psalm. 51. 10. 17.
create, not we;
Make our Hearts such; then happy shall we be.

To build some Stately Church; whiles others stay
Still there, unwrought; though quite as good as they:
It minds us of that common Rock wherein
Mankind corrupted lay, through Adams Sin:
From whence God by Psalm 144. 12. Isa. 14. 11. 12. c. 51. 1. Romans 9. 11. to 31.

When I consider that all Isa. 22. 16. Mark. 15. 46.
Tombestones, Urnes,
And Tombs, where Man, Genesis 3. 19.
mere Dust, to Dust returns;
Are broken pieces of some Rocks; I then
Behold my Tombe-stone, in each Rock I ken:
And say; Lo here is the lasting Monument
Wherein my Body must ere long be pent,
And shut Close Prisner, till the Joh. 5. 58. Rev. 20. 12. 13.

When all its Rust and Bolts shall fall away.
Which Thought digested, makes me still amend
My Life; and fits me always for mine End.
Let all revolve it often within their Mind,
And they shall Treasure, Honey in it find.
3.
When I behold some people dwell, live, lie
In Job 24. 8. Obad. 3. Jer. 48. 28.
Caves of Rocks; I then think presently;
He who a Cottage wants his Head to Hide,
Shall find some Rock, or Hole where to abide;
In which he may sleep freer from fears, Foes,
And Cares, than those whom Castles, Guards, enclose.
What need we care then here for House or Home,
If these should fail, yet Rocks will give us Room
To Lodge and hide in: Here 1 King. 17 4. 13. c. 19. 9. 11. 15. Heb. 11. 38.

Gods dearest Saints
Have lived, and hid often times without Complaints;
And been more happy in these caved Stones
Than greatest Monarchs in their royal Thrones.
Repine not then though Clifts of Rocks should be
Thine House or Home, since there thou may be free,
Safe, blessed, cheerful, and to God more nigh
Than those who in the fairest Palace lie.

When we behold Men with much Danger, Swet,

And draw from Sea-Rockes, for to burn, or dress
Their tilled Grounds, and mend their fruitfulness.
Me thinks it should wring Phil. 3. 18. 19.

With such hard hearts, which will not melt nor tear!

When I behold Rocks, Stones, most ragged, base,
Rude and deformed in their Native place,
2 Chronicles. 2. and 3. 1 King. 5. and 6. and 7.
Hewed out from thence, and polisht by Mankind
Turned into goodly Structures of each Kind
And made rich Statues, Zech. 9. 16. 2 Samuel 12. 30.

Yea, set in Gold and royal Diadems.
I thence conclude, that God with much more ease
Speed, Art, can turn, when ever he shall please,
The Ezech. 36. 26. 1 Cor. 3. 16. 17. 2 Cor. 6. 16. Ephesians. 2. 21. Mal. 3. 17.
hardest, vilest, rockie Hearts that are
Into rich Temples, Jewels, Gemmes most rare;
Yea set them in Christ's very royal Crown
Like precious stones unto their great renown.
As he did 1 Timothy 1. 13 14. 15. 16.
Paul, 2 Chronicles. 33. 12. to 20.

Most glorious Saints which Heaven does now enclose.
Let no man then though never so mean, vile, base,
Lewd, sinful, once despair of Gods free Grace,
Which in a moment can Ephesians. 2. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. c. 3. 20. 21.

When as I see the Job. 28. 10. Ps. 105. 41.

Luke 7. 38. 44. Act. 20. 19. 31. Mat. 26. 75.
Tears that flow
From Rockie Hearts, when they once tender grow.
Through Gods sweet Grace and Spirit, which can melt
The hardest Hearts to Tears, and them relent
As He did Rocks of Old, whence Psalm. 105. 41. Exodus 17. 6 Numb. 20. 11. 12.

By streams when He them either smote or crushed.
Blessed Lord Jesus, soften, break, relent
Our Hearts of Rock, and cause them to repent,
And send forth Streams, nay Floods of Tears to wash,
Our sins away, and all their force to quash.
11.
Job 39. 28. 29. Jer. 49. 16.
Eagles in lofty Rocks still breed and lie,
And from their Tops their Prey far off epsy:
Gods chosen Saints whom Scriptures often compare

Eagles, upon Christ high mounted are:
(The tallest Rock) on whom they Ephesians. 2. 20.
build, lodge, stay,
And thence they seek, find, take their sacred prey.
Lord make our Souls with Eagles wings to fly,
To this sweet Rock, and there to live and dye.

Make trees, herbs, grass, plants, flowers spring and grow;
And quench the Thirst of all things here below;
Yet neither moysten, soften, fructify
The Rocks themselves, still barren, fruitless, dry:
Me thinks I view in them some Rockie Hearts,
Endew'd with rare, rich, profitable Parts
Of Art and Nature; which do good to many,
Yet to their Owners good, they do not any.
How many Preachers others help to save

The Food of life, have starved themselves to death:
Others made Fertile, themselves barren Heath?
How many 2 Samuel 16. 23. c. 17. 23.

Except themselves, and so through folly fall:
Its hardly worth the Name of Good Art, Skill
That betters others, makes the Owners Ill.
13.
When I epsy Rocks trampled on by all,
Christ's and true Christians States, to mind I call.
Isa. 53. 2. 3. 4. Mar. 9. 12. Psalm. 118. 22. 1 Cor. 4. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 2
Cor. 4. 8. 9. 10. 11. c. 6. 4. to 11. Heb. 11. 36. 37. 38.
Trod under feet, with all contempt, spite, hate
Throughout the world, and valued at no rate.
Complain not then of any dis-respect.
No greater Honor than Ill men's neglect.
14.
Each vaste, high-towring, massy Rock we eye
Presents to us the strength and Potencie
Of that Almighty God, whose Isa. 40. 12: to 18. Psalm. 89. 13.
Potent Hand
Did in a moment, both by Sea and Land
Raise up so many vaste high Piles, and Pack
Such Massy Rocks on one another back;
Without an Engine, by his Psalm. 148. 5.
Word alone,
And them so strongly soder one to one
That all the Art, Wit, Strength, in Man's to weak
To raze these Mounts, and them in Pieces break.
We wonder much at See Camdens Brittania Wiltshire.
Stonedge, where there lie
A few large stones, pil'd up not very high
On one another head, and think it strange,
How men such pondrous Stones could rear and range,
In such a manner, though these great stones be
But Pigmies, Pibbles to the Rocks we see.
How much more then with wonder and amaze
Should we upon those Massy high Rocks gaze
Which them so far in Bulk, weight, height exceed,
And may true admiration in us breed
Of Gods Almighty Power, which could raise
Such grand, rare, lasting Trophies to his praise.
To which all Structures made by men do seem
But Mole-hills, Attomes, and of no esteem.
He who such heavy Rocks could make, lift, rear,
Isa. 40. 12. 15.
Weigh, toss with ease, as if they feathers were;
With greater ease can lift and elevate
His humbled Saints out of their Psa. 113. 7. 8. 1 Samuel 2. 7. 8.

When we discern the Sea, and Time to Job. 14. 9.

The very Rocks, and them to waste, eat, tear;
Think and contemplate then, how time, age, space
All things consume, waste, weaken and deface;
But chiefly Men, compact of Genesis 3. 19. Eccles. 3. 10. c. 12. 7.
Dust, not stone
Who fade like Ps. 103. 14. 15. 16. Psa. 90. 5. 6. Isa. 4. 6. 7. 8. Job 14. 1.
2. Jam. 1. 10. 1 Pet. 1. 24.
grass, are in a Moment gone.
How can mere Dust and Ashes think to last,
When time and age the hardest Rocks do wast?
16.
Those who in lofty, fenced, steep Rocks dwell
Are Obad. 3. Jer. 49. 16. c. 21. 13.
haughty, proud, secure, and far excel
Most others in these vices, slighting all,
As if no Mischief could upon them fall.
Whence sudden Dangers, Ruins them surprise
(To quell their Pride) from those they most despise;
Thus carnal Men advanced and fortifide
With potent Friends, wealth, Honors, swell with Ezech. 28. 2. to 29. Isa. 47.
7. to 12. Rev. 18. 7. 8.
Pride;
Deride all Dangers, Foes, grow so secure,
As if their Props and Stays should still endure.
Whence God their Pride to punish and abate
Casts them down headlong by some sudden Fate.
Which should make all, but great men specially
Beware of Pride, and gross Security,
The sad Prove. 16 18 Rev. 18. 7. 8.
Forerunners of a certain fall,
Which them and theirs will soon to pieces mall.
17.
When as we see Men with must cost and pain
To Mine the Rocks, and Treasures thence to gain
Of sundry Sorts; where with they much increase
Their wealth, and make things meet for war and Peace:
It forthwith minds us how with far more care,
Cost, Pains, Sweat, Labor all who Christians are,
Should daily Prove. 2. 4. Col. 2. 2. 3. Mat. 13. 44.
Search, and Mine for richer Oar
In Christ their Rock; in whom there is such store
Of peerless Mines, and Treasures of each Kind
As well content, yea Ephesians. 1. 23 Joh. 1. 16.
fill the vastest Mind;
And store all Christians with all Things they need
In Peace and War, Life, death! Let this then breed
A Resolution in us, still to Mine,
And draw these Treasures from this Rock Divine.
18.
Whiles that we view Men Rocks to smite, pierce, rent
With Sledges, Axes, or like Instrument;
We then should ponder, how we all each day
Our blessed Rock Christ Jesus Amos 2. 13. Heb. 10. 29. c. 6. 6. 2 Pet. 2. 1.
Rev. 1. 7.
smite, stab, slay
A fresh with those accursed Sins and Crimes
Wherewith we grieve, pierce, wound Him at all times:
Which Thought should turn the Edge, and Point of all
Our Sins from Him; upon our selves to mall
Break, wound our Rockie hearts, because we rent,
Abuse Christ thus; and cause us to repent.
19.
When we epsy Rocks dart out Sparks of fire
When smote, or cut with Tools of Steel or I're:
It sweetly minds us, how the Hand of God
Smiting upon us with an Psalm. 2. 9. 10. 11. 12. Isa. 26. 9. 11. 16. Hos. 5.

Should from our Hearts of Rock extract and draw
Such sacred Sparks, yea flames as should them thaw,
Purge all their Dross away, and them inflame
With a most ardent Love, unto his Name.
Lord when thy Rod shall ever on us lite,
Let it such Sparks, and Flames in us excite.
20.
Springs, Quarries, Mines in Rocks, never drawn quite dry;
Present most sweetly to each Mind and Eye
The Ephesians. 3. 8. 10. 19. 20. Joh. 1. 5. 16. Col. 2. 3. 8. 9. 10.

Springs, Treasures, Stores, and vastest Magazines
Of Grace and Goodness, which enclosed lie,
Within the Bosom of the Deity.
To feed, feast, fill, enrich, each hungry, poor,
Sad, pined Soul, with all their matchless store.
The very thoughts whereof our Hearts should fill
With sweetest Solace, and delight them still.
21.
When I perceive the smallest Pibble Exodus 15. 5. Neh. 9. 11. Jer. 51. 63. 64.

In Floods, as deep as greatest Rocks; I think
How smallest Sins are deadly, and as well,
As soon almost, as Great, sink Men to Hell.
O then beware of all sins, since the small
As well as great to Rom 6. 23. c. 7. 24. 25. Ec. 12. 18. Math. 12. 36. 37.
Hell thus tend and fall.
Let Papists talk of Venial sins, I trow
No sin is venial, when all sink so low.
22.
The worthless Rubbish in each Rock exceeds,
And hides the Mines and Precious stones it breeds:
Yea, richest Mines have ever greater Store
Of dross and off all, than refined Oar.
Which pondred, learnes us, how each Place, Mat. 7. 13. 14. c. 13. 3. to 51.
Luke 13. 23. 24. Romans 10. 16. c. 11. 4 5.
Church breeds
More Bad than Good: that Good Men's Ill, exceeds
Their Goodness: that the Bad, Good Men obscure
As Rubbish hides, Surmounts the Oar that is pure.
Hence Multitude, and visibility
Appear ill Marks a Churches Truth to try.
23.
When Josh. 10. 11 Judge 9. 53. 54. 2 Samuel 11. 21. Zech. 12. 3. Luke 13. 4.
Rocks or Stones fall on Men, and them dash
To pieces, or at least them bruise and quash:
It minds us how our Rock Christ Isa. 8. 14* 15. Luke 2. 34. Psa. 2 9. Rev.
2. 27. c. 19. 15.
grindeth all

O then beware how we pull on our backs
This Massy Rock which Men to pieces crackes.
24.
Psalm. 41. 2. Psalm. 61. 2.
Rocks keep from sinking those who walk or Stand
Upon them, whiles such, who on Bogges, Floods, Sand
Do walk, Psalm. 40. 2. Psalm. 69. 2. 14. Mat. 14. 30. Jer. 38. 6. 20.
rest, stay, sink down and mired are,
Yea often times drowned without special care.
Hence may we learn that those who walk, rest, stay,
Themselves on Christ (the surest Rock) always
Stand firm, safe, stable; never sinking down;
Whiles those who on Bogges, Sands sink, stand, and drown.
O let our feet on this Rock still abide
Then are we certain not to sink, fall, slide.
25.
Rocks those who dwell upon them fence, Isa. 33. 16.

But those who Scale them, hurt, bruise and offend.
So Christ our Rock Joh. 10. 11. 14. 27. 28. 29. 1 Pet. 1. 5. c. 4. 19.
protects his Chosen sheep
Who rest upon Him, does them safely keep.
Yet hurts and breaks to Luke 2. 39. Mat. 21. 44. Ps. 2. 9. 10.

Who dare presume Him, and them to oppose.

And into Caves, Holes, Clifts of Rocks shall fly
To hide them from the Wrath, Sight, Majesty

The Rocks shall then melt, fall, quake, change their place.

Till dragged perforce before Christ's Bar and Face,

O let the Terror of this dismal Day,
(Which now draws near, and we should Jam. 5. 7. 8. 9. Rev. 22. 20
mind always;)
For ever scare us from all Sin, and make
Our Stony Hearts to melt, bleed, sigh, break, ache:
And cause us now with speed to fly and hide
Our selves within the Holes of Christ's pierced side,
Who shall us 2 Cor. 5. 10. 11. Romans 14. 10. 11. 12. Romans 2. 16. Psa. 143. 9.

Crown
Of endless Glory, in the Heavens high
Where we shall reign for all Eternity. Rev. 22. 4. 5.

O Christ (our only Rock) of thy free Grace
Advance, and bring us to this blisfull Place:
And let each Rock, Clift, Stone we henceforth see
Instruct us thus, and bring us home to Thee.
The Conclusion.
With these sweet useful Thoughts, and thousands more
The Barren Rocks, our Hearts, and Minds may store
When we behold them: and if Natures Book,
And Rocks, whiles we upon them daily look,
Can teach us Nothing which our Lives may mend,
Or cause our Hearts, Minds, Thoughts up to ascend*
To Christ their Rock, God, and the Things above,
Them to contemplate with the greatest Love;
Our Hearts are Rockie; We, quite void of Grace;
And Rocks than we, are yet in better Case.

A CHRISTIAN SEA-CARD. Consisting of sundry Poetical Meditations, raised from
the Contemplation of the Nature and Qualities of the Sea.

BY WILLIAM PRYNNE, Late Exile and Close Prisoner in Mount-Orgueil Castle in
the Isle of Iersy.

Psalm 104. 24. 25. 26. O Lord how manifold are thy Works! in Wisdom have
thou made them all; the Earth is full of thy Riches. So is this great and wide
SEA, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.
There go the Ships; there is that Leviathan thou have made to play therein.

Psalm. 77. 19. Thy way is in the SEA, and thy path in the GREAT WATERS, and thy
footesteps are not known.

Isaiah 43. 1. 2. 3. 5. 6. But now thus says the Lord that created thee, O
Jacob, and he that formed thee O Israel; Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, I
have called thee by thy Name, thou art mine. When thou passest through the
WATERS I will be with thee, and through the RIVERS, they shall not overflow
thee; when thou walk through the fire thou shall not be burnt, neither shall
the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel,
thy Savior, etc.

Psalm 66. 12. Thou have caused men to ride over our heads; we went through
FIRE and through WATER, but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.

Green Arbor. 1641.

TO The Worshipful his highly Honored Friend Mrs Elizabeth Carteret, Daughter
to Sir Philip Carteret, Knight, Lieutenant Governor and Bayliffe of the Isle
of Jersy.
THat near relation wherein now you stand
By Habitation, and a Nuptial Band,
To Seas, and Seamen; did at first induce
Me to digest this SEA-CARD for your Use,
And his you most esteem; which in some sort
May help conduct you unto Heavens blessed Port,
The only Haven which you now most Eye,
And strive for to arrive in when you dye.
Accept it therefore (though scarce worthy view,)
As a small pledge of his Respects to you,
Who much adores your Virtues, and must deem
His Muse too mean to add to your esteem.
Your Engaged Friend WILLIAM PRYNNE.

Since God Seas, Rocks, in Place has joined together
It were unkindnesse them in Verse to sever.
And hence my Muse, which bates to be unkind,
Has them, in these two Poems, here combinde.

Which he is blind, who sees not in each Flower.

From whence a pious Heart may raise such store
Of godly Thoughts, that plenty makes it poor.

ANd first, the vaste Sea, which with speed can Genesis 7. 18. to 24.

As easy as the smallest, Molehill, Boat,
Or cottage, in its all-devouring throat;
Most sweetly represents to sinful Man
The vaste, immense, and boundless Mich. 7. 19.
Ocean
Of Gods free Grace and Mercy; so profound,
That worlds of greatest sins in it are drowned;
No crimes so heinous, great, or numberless;
But if with bleeding souls we them ^. Joh. 1. 7. Rev. 1. 5.
confess
And quite abandon, this large sea of Grace
Shall over-whelme, wash out, and clean deface:
O sweetest solace to a broken Heart,
And sinne-sicke soul, desirous to convert!
What though thy horrid sins and heinous crimes,
Be greater than the world ten thousand times?
Lo, here is a Sea more vast shall 1 John 1. 7. Rev. 1. 5. Mich. 7. 19.
drown them all
Without exception, great, as deep, as small.
O then despair not, but behold with joy
This Ocean, which shall all thy sins destroy.
Lord, let us ever Sail in this sweet Sea,
Where Souls are saved, Sins only Shipwrackt be.

Or as the Sea, that shadows to our eyes,

Which is so near them both by Sea and Land?

The Sea so useful, good, and meet for Fish
And foul of all sorts that man's heart can wish:
For Salt, Clounds, rain, springs, rivers Eccles. 1. 7. Psalm. 104. 9. 10.

Once more; the Springs and Rivers which Eccles. 1. 7. Psalm. 104. 9. 10.
ascend
Out of the Sea at first, and in it end:
Instruct us sweetly, how that every thing
From God ( the Sea of being) Romans 11. 36. Genesis 1. 1. Pro. 16. 4.
first did spring:
And therefore should by way of thankfulness
Their course, Aims, Ends to him alone address,
But chiefly Man, (first made, and since that 1 Cor. 11. 31. 1 Pet. 4. 11.

Should all return to him from whom it flows,
Since 1 Chronicles. 29. 11. to 18. 1 Cor. 4 7. and 15. 10.

O let us study from our Hearts to give
All unto him, Act. 17. 28.

It is his 1 Chronicles. 29. 11. to 18. Psalm. 29. 2. Psalm. 56. 12. Psalm. 116. 12.

To render to him, who our souls must save:
Most blessed God let us thus often behold
Thee in this Crystal glass, the Sea, our cold
And frozen Hearts to warm, with these sweet Rays
Which it reflects, to thine eternal praise.
Meditations of the second Sort.
Again the Sea's of Christ a lively Type
And his dear blood, which does our sins out-wipe.
1.
For, as the Sea all filth does cleanse away
From Bodies, Vessels, Meats, Herbs, Fruits, Array,
That in it washed are: So Christ's sweet Blood
(More Mal. 3. 2. 3.
clensing than the purest spring or Flood)
1 John 1. 7. Rev. 1. 5. Isa. 1. 16. 17.
All filth and spots of sin, which Souls defile,
And in Gods eyes present them foul and vile,
Does quite abolish, and so purge away
From all such souls, as on him fast hold lay
By faith unfeigned, that no filth nor stain
Of any sin, upon them shall remain
To make 1 John 1. 7. Rev. 1. 5. Heb. 9. 14. Ephesians. 5. 26. 27. 1 Cor. 6. 11.

In which they shine as stars most clear and bright.
O let us prize this Blood beyond compare,
By which our Souls from sin thus cleansed are. Dan. 12. 3. Mat. 13. 43.
Phil. 2. 15.

2.
The Sea which did the Genesis 7. and 8.
wicked world destroy
By Gods command; yet saved upright Noy.
With that red Sea, Exodus 14. 15. to 31.
which the Egyptians drowned
When Gods own people past it on dry ground
In safety, shadow that red Sea of Blood,
Which Christ upon the Col. 1. 20. Rev. 7. 14.
Cross shed for our good:
Wherein the Mich. 7. 19. 1 John 1. 7. Jer. 50. 20. c. 31. 34.
sins of all his chosen sheep
With Hellish Pharaoh, and his Host, so deep
Are sunk and drowned, that they never shall
Appear again, their Souls once to inthrall.
O let our Sins in this red Sea be dround,
Then are we certain naught shall us Isa. 45. 17.
confound.
3.
The Sea's the way, means, pass to Jonah. 1. 3. Isa. 8. 2.

From Earth to Heaven, and eternal Joys.
Sweet Jesus let the Sea of thy blessed Blood
Conduct and lead us safely through the Flood
And Rocks of this worlds Sea, to Heavens Port,
To which thy chosen Flock with have resort.

The Seas fair, lovely, shining azure Face,
It Is pleasant Calmes in Halcion-daies Gods Grace,

The saddest Hearts and fills them with content
And matchless joys) most lively represent.
O then in all our grief and misery,
On Gods sweet smiling Face still fix an Eye,
Which will support our souls in all distress,
And cheer them so, that naught shall us oppress.
Sweet Jesus when the Sea we view or pass,
Present thy self thus to us in its glass:
Then if it wrecke or drown us, yet shall we
Through thy Bloods Sea, escape and saved be.
Meditations of the third Rank.
BEsides, the Sea exhibits to our sight
A lively Emblem of the State and plight
Of Gods Elect, with all those sore and great
Storms of Afflictions, which do daily beat
Upon them, whiles they pass this Sea below.
Where 1 Pet. 5. 8. 1 John 215. 16. 1 Pet. 2. 11.
World, Flesh, Devil, seek to overthrow.

For first, the Sea is Isa. 57. 20.
restless night and Day;
Its flux and constant progress, none can stay:
Just so are Gods elect, who always move;
Psalm. 84. 7. Phil. 3. 13. 14. 15.
Tending to Heaven and the things above;
No Banks, Wind, Storms, Romans 8. 35. 36. 37. 38. 39. 2 Cor. 1. 8. 9. 10. 11.
c. 6. 4. to 11. Heb. 11. 35. 36. 37.
threats, death, their course can cease
Till they arive at Heavens Port in Peace.
2.
The Sea is ever Jam. 1. 6. Jer. 5. 22.
tossed from place to place
With Winds, storms, Tides: And is not this the Case
Of Gods dear Saints? still Job 7. 4. Psalm. 109. 23. Isa. 22. 18. c. 54. 11.
Heb. 11. 8. 9. 13. 14. 27. 37. Genesis 12. 1. 5. 6. 8. 9. 10. c. 15. 13. 1 Cor.

handed too and fro
(By sundry Tempests which they undergo)
From Coast to Coast, from Goal to Goal, to show
They Pilgrims are, and Strangers here below.
Fixed to no Certain Clime, and that their home
And resting place, is in the world to come. Genesis 47. 9. 1 Chronicles. 29. 15 Psalm.
39. 12. Psalm. 119. 19. Heb. 11. 13. 14. 1 Pet. 2. 11. Lev. 25. 23.

3.
The Sea is ever working, purging forth,
And Isa. 57. 20.
casting out filth, weeds, trash of no worth
Which falls into it, and corrupt, defile
Its Crystal streams, making them foul and vile.
Thus Gods Elect still Isa. 1. 16. Cant. 5. 3. 1 Cor. 6. 11. 2 Cor. 7. 1. Rev.
7. 14. Heb. 9. 14. Tit. 3. 3. 5. Ephesians. 4. 22. to 32.
purge out, and eject.
Those Lusts, sins, vices, which their Souls infect
With such suggestions as foul Devils cast
Into their Hearts, them to pollute and Waste.
4.
The Sea's Psalm. 107. 25. to 30. Jon. 1.
exposed to all storms and Winds;
So Psalm. 34. 19. Psalm. 42. 7. Act. 14. 22. Heb. 11. 35. 36. 37. 38. 2 Cor. 11.
23. to 29. Ruth. 1. 20. 21.
Saints to Troubles, Crosses, of all kinds,
To make them humble, and translate their love
From things on Earth, unto the things above.
5.
None dare to cross the Sea without a Card
Or Compass, which they still with care regard,
Stearing their course thereby, for fear they stray
Or miss their Port, and so be cast away:
Thus Gods Elect, whilst they do sail and rove
In this worlds Sea, by Compass ever move;
Stearing their Rudder, by Psalm. 119. 9. 11. 24. 30. 98. to 106. Gal. 6. 16. 2
Pet. 1. 19.
Gods Sacred Writ
For fear they miss their Harbor, or else hit
Their Souls against those Rocks, Shelves, Sands which lie
To Cross their voyage to Eternity.
6.
The Ebbing Sea discovers to the eye
Those dangrous Rocks, Shelves, Sands, that hidden lie
At full Sea Tides, which then often drown and sink
Those who approach them, when they least fear, think
Of any danger: So the Ebbing State,
The Crosses of Gods Chosen Psalm. 119. 67. 71. Ezech. 16. 62. 63. 2 Chronicles. 23.
11. 12. 13. Heb. 11. 24. 25. 26. 27.
Demonstrate
And point out to them many Rocks, Shelves, Sands,
To shipwreck Souls, betray them to the hands
Of Hellish Pirates, which still hidden lie,
And undiscerned in prosperity.
By which they shun their danger, and commend
These Ebbes, which from such perils them defend,
Before those Full-Sea-Tides of wealth and joy,
Which Prove. 1. 32. Jer. 22. 21. 1 John 2. 15. 16. 1 Timothy 6. 9. 10.
Shipwrecke thousands, and their Souls destroy.
7.
The lowest Ebb, has still the highest Flood;
Saints deepest sorrows Psalm. 1 26. 2. 3. 5. 6. Isa. 25. 8. 9. c. 35. 3. 4.

17.
end in greatest good:
Their Floods of joy transcend their Ebbes of woe
Beyond compare, and all their griefs out-goe.
8.
When Seas are at their lowest Ebb, they then
Forthwith begin to spring and flow. So men
Beloved of God, when as they seem to lie
At lowest Ephesians. 3. 20. 21. Genesis 22. 10. to 20. c. 42. 9. to 50. Exodus 12. and

Ebb, in deepest misery,
Past help, past hope in Carnal men's account,
Beyond all expectation, spring and mount
Above their Crosses, and enjoy a Flood
Of Peace, wealth, honor; and the greast good.
If old examples fail, you may now view
The truth hereof in some yet fresh and new.
9.
Gods Psalm. 95. 4. 5. Job 38. 2. 10.
Will and pleasure only is the Cause
Why Seas do Ebb and flow; not any Laws
Of Nature, Moon, or Planets: So the will
And Job 1. 21. 1 Samuel 3. 18. and 2. 6. 7. 8. Deuteronomy. 32. 39. Mat. 10. 29. 30. 31.
blessed pleasure of our God is still
The first chief cause, of all the Ebbes and Tides
Which here befall his Saints, naught else besides:
Yea, as Sea Storms Psalm. 107. 25. 26. 27. Jon. 1. 4.
proceed from God, and toss
Men up toward Heaven: So each storm and cross
Which lite on Gods Elect Psalm. 73. 14. 25. 26. 28. Phi. 3. 26. Psalm. 130. 1.
5. 6.
from him first springs
And nearer Heaven them lifts up, and brings.
10.
The Sea is Numb. 34. 3. 12.
Salt and brackish: Crosses are
The like, at Heb. 12. 11. Psalm. 71. 20. Ruth. 1. 20.

11.
The Saltest Seas the sweetest Fishes breed:
Saints 2 Cor. 1. 4. 5. 6. Heb. 12. 11. 12. Psalm. 126. 5. 6.
sweetest comforts from the Cross proceed:
Yea, as the best and largest Fish are found
In Saltest waters: So the best, most sound,
Large, strongest Christians, which we find, or know,
In Psalm. 119. 67. 71. Isa. 48. 10. Jam. 5. 10.
harshest Floods of Sorrows always grow.
12.
The Seas salt waters cleanse and purify
Things that are filthy: Thus adversity
Does Dan. 12. 35. c. 12. 10. Isa. 1. 25. 1 Pet. 1. 7. Zech. 13. 9.
purge and wash away from Gods Elect
Those Spots, sins; vices, which their Souls infect.
13.
Seas brinish waters pickle and preserve
Things from corruption: So Psalm. 119. 61. 71. 75. 2 Timothy 4. 17. 18. ^^^ 30.
20. 21.
Afflictions serve
To season Saints, who else would putrify,
And rot in those foul sins, which now they fly.
14.
Sea storms drive Men to Psalm. 107. 27. 28. 29. Jon. 1. 4. to 16. Mat. 8. 24.
25.
prayers, cries, and tears,
Augmented and intended by their Fears:
Yea, make them post to Harbors, for relief;
And bid the Sea adieu with Joy, not grief:
Thus troubles cause the Saints to Psalm. 18. 6. 118. 15. 120. 1. Hos. 5. 15.
pray and cry
To God for help with greater fervencie;
Intend, increase their prayers; make them Psalm. 143. 9. 10. 11. 12.
fly
To God their Harbor, for security;
Cause them to loath and Phil. 1. 21. 23. Job 10. 1. 1 King. 19. 4.

Whose waves and Tempests them still sore annoy.
15.
And as great blustering storms do sooner drive
Ships to the Harbors where they would arive,
Then Calmes and mildest Gales: So Hosea 5. 15. Psalm. 107. 27. 38. 30. Psalm.
143. 9. 10.
Crosses mend
Gods darlings speed, and often times sooner send
Them unto Heaven, then Psalm. 30. 6. Jer. 22. 21. Pro. 1. 27.
prosperity,
Which calmes their Sails, and makes them still to lie.
16.
The Tempest that befell the Ship wherein
The Prophet Jonah 1.
Jonah fled, and slept in sin,
Did never slack nor cease, till he was cast
Into the Sea, which done, the storm was past:
So, Saints afflictions Josh. 7. 11. 12. Jona. 3. 10. Hos. 5. 15. Isa. 27. 9.
Ezeck. 16. 61. c. 36. 21. to 38.
never swage nor end,
Till Jonah be cast out, and they amend,
Which done, their Tempests cease, and calmes succeed,
Unless some other Jonah in them breed.
17.
In storms at Sea, the Jer. 51. 42. Mat. 6. 24. Psalm. 107. 27. 28. 29.
waves come on so fast,
That fresh succeed before the first be past:
So Crosses on Gods Saints so thick often lite
To humble, Dan. 11. 35.
try, purge, wash and make them bright:
That one Job. 1. 13. to 22. Psalm. 42. 7. 88. 7. and 34. 19. Isa. 54. 11.
treads on the others heels, and new
Come on before the old bid them adieu.
18.
Yet, as Sea-stormes, though long, still Psalm. 107. 28. 29. 30. Jon. 1. 5. Mat.
8. 24. 26. Psalm. 8. 9.
end at last
In pleasant Calmes; thus Cross, which so fast,

In Gods due time, in sweetest Calmes of peace,
And Tides of Joy: Blessed Tempests which so cease!

The Seas great deluge did both Genesis 7. and 8.

The wicked old world, and it overthrow,
Yet Righteous Noe did then escape its rage;
And landed safely when the Flood did swage.

Ariving safely, when the Storms are past,
In Heavens Harbor, where they Anchor cast.

All those who use the Sea, do ever mind
The Psalm. 107. 30.
Port to which thy Sail; and as the wind
Does bring them nearer to it day by day
Their Joys increase, the more sails on they lay,
Longing to end their voyage, and arive
At that sweet Haven unto which they drive:
Thus Gods Elect Phil. 1. 23. c. 3. 2. 3. Romans 8. 23. 2 Cor. 5. 1. 2. 3. 5. 8.
Luke 2. 29. 2 Timothy 4. 6. 7. 8. Rev. 22. 20.
have always in their Eye
The Port above, to which they daily fly
With all their speed and might, and as each day
Does bring them nearer to this happy Bay;
Their inward Joys and Comforts still increase,
The more they long there to arive in peace:
Mending their speed, embracing with delight
(That which all others does so sore affright)
Grim Luke 2. 29. Genesis 46. 30.
pallid Death, the Pilot to convoy
Them to this Haven of Eternal Joy.
Lord, teach us Heavens Port thus still to eye
Whilst here we sail, that when we come to dye,
We may attain it; and there safely ride
Free from all perrils of winds, storms, and tide.
Lord make us thine Elect, that we may gain
This Port, where all thy Saints in bliss shall reign.

But 2 Chronicles. 28. 19. 22. 23. 1 Cor 15. 33.
dirt and filth of Oaths, lewd talk, sins, crimes,
And noisome lusts; which they cast up often times
In such abundance, that they soon 1 Cor. 5. 6. Gal. 5. 9. 2 Kin. 13. 6. c.

They seem most firm; changing their friendship, love,
Yea Faith, Oaths, Friends; as Times, Winds, Tides them move.
5.
We see, the Sea is Eccles. 1. 7.

Amidst the which they so long sail and play,
Till both their souls be split and cast away.
9.
The Sea is harsh, tart, brinish, and naught grows
Upon those Sands and Banks it over-flowes:
Ungodly men are 1 Samuel 25. 10. 11. Romans 1. 29. 30. 31. 2 Timothy 3. 2. 3. 4.

Unkind, at least to those who are renu'de:

Lewd men are such, no 2 Timothy 3. 2. 3. 4. Jam. 3. 7. 8. Psalm. 2. 2. 3.
mortal wight but God
Can break, tame, sway them, with his Iron Rod.
13.
Sea waters heated, soon grow cold again,
And always after cold, harsh, salt, remain;
So wicked men heat with afflictions fire
Or some good fits of zeal, do Psalm. 106. 13. 21. Hos 6. 4.
soon retire
Unto their former coldness, brackishnesse,
Which to their Joh. 8. 21. 24.
dying days do them possess.
14.
We see Sea waters themselves cast and mold
Into each vessels shape, which does them hold:
So, ill men will themselves Psalm. 106. 35. 36. Judge. 1. 21. 33. c. 2. 2.
shape, and apply
To every place, time, fashion, company;
And water like, will suite themselves full well
To any Sect, Religion, where they dwell.
15.
The Sea, with rage, the Rocks does often assail,
To over-turne them, yet can naught prevail,
But still with loss self does break and split,
Not them, whiles its fierce waves against them hit:
Thus wicked men, whilst they with fury rage
Against our Rock Christ, or his Heritage,
Themselves (not him, nor them) to Psalm. 2. 2. 3. 9. Rev. 2. 27. Ps. 50. 22.
Mat. 21. 44. Isa. 8. 9.

And in the close, naught but confusion find.
O dash not then against these Rocks, which shall
Stand Psalm. 125. 1. Prove. 10. 30. Isa. 33. 20. Mat. 7. 24. 25.
firm amidst all storms that on them fall:
Lord let us never be of this lewd crew,
But with thy grace our Hearts and Lives renew
That so we may escape that Rev. 19. 20. c. 20. 10. c. 21. 8. Mat. 25. 41.

Where they shall ever feel thy scalding Ire.
Meditations of the fifth Sort.
ONce more, me thinks the Sea (which ever floates,
But never rests,) presents unto my thoughts
A lively Map of this vain World; (which, it.
In some respects resembles very fit;)
Yielding them ample Sea-roome, for to hale,
And chase this Theme with a delightful Gale,
Until my roving Muse, quite tired shall
Take in her Sails, and let her Anchor fall.
1.
Now to begin this pleasing chase? the Seas
Are salt, harsh, brackish, and no Pallats please:
This world is Ruth. 1. 20. 21. Exodus 1. 19. Job. 3. 10. c. 13. 26. c. 23. 2.
bitter, tart, and salt to all,
Through sickness, sorrows, crosses, which befall
Them in some kind or other, for to make
Their Hearts more willing its love to forsake:
But most unpleasant is it to Gods Saints
Of any others; whose most sad Job 3. and 6. 10. Psa. 6. and 31. and 35. and
38. and 62. and 69 and 22. Lam. 1. and 2. and 3. and 4.

sharp Brine, would pierce a heart of steel,
And make all salt we in it taste, or feel.
How can we then this brinish world once love,
Or be unwilling from it to remove
Unto that other? fraught with all Psalm. 16. 11. Isa. 35. 10. c. 51. 11. Rev.
22. 2. to 8.
delights,
All sweetest Joys, and Soule-refreshing sights!
2.
Sea waters drunk down, hurt, gnaw, fret, decay
The Entralls, and often times take life away:
This brackish world, quaft down, Jam. 4. 4. 9. 10. 1 John 2. 15. 16. 17..
the soul annoyes,
Corrodes, consumes, and at the last destroys.
Those who sippe of it, sickely grow, but such
Are past all cure, who swallow overmuch.
O let us never bibbe, carouse, or 1 Cor. 7. 30. 31. 1 John 2. 15. 16.
love
Her poysnous cups, which do so deadly prove.
3.
Salt waters still increase, not quench men's thirst,
He that drinks these, is dryer than at first:
This worlds salt streams men's drought can never swage,
The more they drink, the Eccles 4. 8. c. 5. 15. Isa 56. 11.
more their thirst does rage;
A cup or two, still makes them long for more;
And none so dry, as those who have most store
Of this worlds waters, which do only feed
Not quench the dropsy; cause, not help their need.
O taste not then her streams, but them defy,
Which swage no thirst, but make men still more dry.
4.
The Sea is ever Jam. 1. 6. Isa 57. 20.
floating, changing place,
State, and condition, never in one Case:
Sometimes it flows a space; then ebbes again
Forthwith; and Storms, its Calmes still entertain.
If now it smiles, anon it frowns, foames, swells,
Ringing the changes more than any Bells:
This 1 Cor 7. 31.
world is flitting, fickle, mutable;
We all like Psalm. 39. 9. 119. 19. Levit. 25. 23. 1 Chro. 29. 15. 1 Pet. 2. 11.
Heb. 11. 8. 9. 13. 14. 15. 16. 37. 38. Psalm. 107. 4. 5.
strangers, pilgrims in it dwell,
Roving from place to place till death arrest
Our wandering Corpse, and lose us in Earthes breast.
Sometimes the flowing Tides of happiness
Mount us aloft; anon, some Ebbes depresse
And cast us down; far lower than before,
As happy made, to be more vile and poor.
One space a Calm or pleasant Gale does smile
And breath upon us; but within a while,
Tempestuous storms and whirle-winds over-take,
Toss; tear, split, sink us, and we shipwreck make.
To day we rich are, Job 1. 13. to 22. Prove. 23. 5.

Such fatal changes in their worldly State,

Unconstant world (more full of changes then
The Sea or Moon) how can the sons of men
Once 1 John 2. 15. 16. 17.
love or trust thee? Go, cheat
Thy sickely friendship ever will defy.
5.
The Sea is full of Act. 27. 29.
Rocks, which sink and quash.
Those Ships, Barks, Boats, that do against them dash:
This world has far more Rocks to wrack and Split
The Souls of such as do against them hit.
1 John 2. 15. 16. 17. c. 5. 19. Jam. 4. 4. 1 Timothy 6. 9. 10. 11.
Wealth, honors, lusts, pompes, pleasures, pride of Life,
With sundry other Rocks, are here at strife
Which shall most souls destroy, and sink to Hell,
In Seas and Rev. 19. 20. c. 20. 10. Mat. 25. 41.
Lakes of brimstone still to dwell.
How dare we then approach these Rocks, or run
Upon them, which whole Millions have undone?
Or take delight this worlds ill Seas to cross,
Where most are Wreckt, none escape without some loss?
6.
The Sea a smiling, shining azure face
And lovely outside has her self to grace;
Wherewith she hides her savage cruelty,
Rocks, Shelves, Gulfes, and those Monsters that do lie
Close couched in her, to wrecke and to devour
All those her beauty draws within their power.
This cheating flatring world, men's souls to train
Into her deadly Snares (where they remain
Fast hampred till they perish) still presents
Her self to them, decked with such Ornaments,
Such outside, beauty, pomp, State, gaudinesse,
And seeming shows of present happiness,
As ravish most men's Eyes and Hearts 1 John 15. 16. 17. Jam. 4. 4. Col. 3. 2.
with Love
Of her, and turn them from the things above.
Whereas, if they once saw, or could discry
Those horrid Monsters, Rocks, gulfes, snares that lie
Hid under her fair surface, they would shun
Her Love, and faster from, than to her run
O let us view her intrals, not her skin;
She Is Gold without, but Poison, Dross, within.
7.
The Sealyes open to all Jonah. 1. 4. Psalm. 107. 25. 26. 29.

This world exposed is unto Joh. 16. 33. 1 Pet. 5. 9. 2 Cor. 6. 4. 2 Timothy 3.
11. 12. 2 Cor. 4. 8. to 13.
all kinds
Of Tempests, Crosses, Losses, Gustes, and Harms:
How can we then lie sleeping in her Arms?
Or hope to find peace, rest, content, or bliss
In her, where we are certain all to miss?
8.
The Clouds above much darken, and obscure
The Seas bright shining face, whiles they endure:
So clouds of crosses sent from God, deface
This worlds bright Luster, much eclipse her grace;
Making her Job 10. 1. 1 John 2. 15. 16. 2 Cor. 5. 2. 3. 4. Romans 8. 19. to 24.
loathsome in these very Eyes,
Which in her Sunshine, did her over prise.
9.
Those Fogges, Clouds, Storms, which dark the light-some skies
Eclipse the Sunshine, work much harm, arise
Out of the 1 King. 19. 43. 44. Job 38. 8. 9.
Sea at first: Most clouds of woes
Mists, fogges of sorrows which do interpose
Twixt Men and Heaven, hiding Gods sweet Face
And presence from them, with his Rays of grace,
1 Timothy 6. 9. 10. Jam. 5. 1. to 7. Eccles. 2. 22. 23.
Vexing their Hearts, Minds, Souls, do ever spring
From this worlds Seas, which naught but mischief bring.
O let us never fix our minds or Hearts
On her, that is the cause of all our smarts!
10.
The lowest Ebbes Seas highest Tides succeed:
Men's greatest falls from this worlds heights proceed;
Expect then when her Tides do highest flow,
Some Esth. c. 6. to 9. Dan. 4. 30. to 34. Act. 12. 11. 12. 13. Luke 12. 15. to
21.
great approaching Ebb to bring thee low.
Let not then her spring Tides of happiness
Make men secure, proud, haughty, or to bless
Themselves without good cause, since none so nigh
Are to a fall, as those she mounts most high.
11.
The Breaches which the Sea makes on the maine
Are Lam. 2. 13. 2 Samuel 1. 20.
hardly made up, or repaired again:
The Ruptures which this worlds Floods daily make
Upon those Souls they batter, enter, take,
Are Heb. 6. 5. 6. 7. 2 Timothy 4. 10. Mat. 13. 20. 1 Cor. 7. 31. 33. 34. Gal. 1.
4. 1 Timothy 6. 17. 2 Pet. 2. 17. 20. 21.
hardly cured and stopped up? Beware
Their Breaches then, and them prevent with care;
Their entrance is at first with Ease debarred
But once got in, them to repulse is hard.
12.
All Rivers Eccles. 1. 7.
run into the Sea, yet still
It empty is, and never has its fill,
The streams of most men's Cares, thoughts, labors, brains,
Into this worlds Sea run, which yet remains
As Eccles. 5. 10. Isa. 56. 11.
empty as before. O then bestow
Naught upon that which never full will grow.
13.
Most livelesse things, as mettalls, stones, dust, sand
And pondrous bodies Exodus 15. 5. 10.
sink down out of hand
As soon as cast into the Sea; where drowned,
They are so lost, that they cannot be found.
Yet trees, which mount from Earth up to the sky
Whiles they are growing; and such fowls as fly
Up toward heaven, safely Genesis 7. 17. 18.
swim, and ride
Upon the Sea, not fearing, winds, storms, tide:
So men, deprived of the Life of Grace
Made all of Psalm. 10. 18. Joh. 3. 31. Phi. 3. 19. Col. 3. 2.
Earth, on which they fix and place
Their hearts and thoughts; no sooner lanch or fall
Into this worlds Sea, but they sink down all
So deep into it, that it 1 Timothy 6. 9. 10. 2 Timothy 4. 10. Eccl. 2. 22. 23. 1 John 5. 19.
drownes them quite,
And in a moment swallows out of sight.
Whereas Gods chosen Saints, whose hearts and Love
Are ever centred on the Phil. 2. 20. Col. 3. 1. 20. 1 John 5. 4. 5. Jam. 1.
27. 1 Cor. 7. 33.
things above,
And soaring upwards, safely swim and bear
Themselves above her floods, and still appear.
14.
Sea waters quench not, but increase the flame
On which men cast them. This worlds do the same;
Her streams Eccles. 5. 10. Isa. 56. 11. Hab. 2. 5.
augment, not quench men's raging fire,
The more they have, the more they still desire.
Why should we then affect her floods, or store
Which never make us rich, but ever poor?
15.
The Sea still Jona. 1. 13.
moves and runs with Wind and Tide,
These steare this World, and do her Rudder guide:
If Times, Winds, Tide, move with us, then will she
Run 2 King. 9. 30. to 35. c. 10. 1. to 12. Esth. c. 6. and 7. and 8. Pro.
14. 20. Lam. 1. 2. 8. Psa. 88. 18. Prove. 19. 20. c. 19. 14. 19. Psalm. 38. 11.
with us too, and friendly seem to be;
But let them once, begin on us to frown,
She Will join with them to wreck and cast us down.
O falfe deceitful world, who do forsake
All when they need thee most, and never take
Their parts but when they need thee not, adieu:
Unconstant friends are ever false, not true.
16.
The Sea the Earth does compass and Genesis 2. 11. Lam. 2. 13. Hab. 3. 9. 10.
Amos 9. 5. Ezech. 27. 34.
surround,
Some parts whereof by it are often drowned:
Just so this 2 Pet. 2. 20. 21. c. 1. 4. Gal. 1. 4.
world environs men about,
Their Souls to swallow, so that 'few swim out
Or escape her danger. O thrice happy he
That can sail through it, and not drowned be.
17.
Sea fights of any other are most fell,
Fierce, bloody, dangerous, hot and terrible.
The Battles which this 2 Pet. 2. 19. 20. 21. 1 Cor. 3. 18. 19. Gal. 1. 4. Ephesians.
2. 2. Ephesians. 6. 12. Col. 2. 8. 20. 1 Timothy 6. 17. 2 Timothy 4. 10. Jam. 4. 4. 1 John
2. 15. 16. 1 John 5. 4. 5. 19.
world does daily make
Against men's Souls them to destroy, or take,
Are far more dangerous, deadly, worse than those
Wherewith the Flesh, or Devil them oppose:
Her Engines, trains, assaults, theirs much exceed,
And none can escape them without special heed.
18.
As Ships built on the Land with force, toil, be
Still lanched and dradge out into the Sea:
So man whence once formed in his Mothers womb
With painful Genesis 3. 16. c. 35. 16. 17. 18. Job 3. 3. 4. 5. 8.
Labor is enforst to come;
And lanch'd by her into the worlds wide Sea,
Where he from winds and storms is seldom free.
Hence he with sighs, tears, cries, Job 14. 1. 2. c. 3. 3. to 26.
laments in vain,
As soon as borne, what he must here sustain:
O let us then with Luke 2. 29. 30. Genesis 46. 30. Job 3. 3. to 10. Rev. 22. 20.
songs and shouts of joy
Leave this worlds Sea, which does us sore annoy:
And since we enter it with tears, cries, pain,
Its madness thus to part from it again.
What we with force, grief, sobs, first undertake;
We should with Phil. 1. 20. 23. 2. Cor. 5 2. 31. 5. Romans 8. 22. 23.
cheerful hearts at last forsake.
Like ships, which gladly run themselves a shore;
Because perforce lanch'd into Seas before.
And yet the most with greater Psalm. 55. 4. 116. 3.
grief (O Sin!)
Depart this world, than they it entered in,
And must by might, with groans, tears, shreekes and cry
Be pulled out thence, and forced with woe to dye.
Blessed Lord God, so steare our ships and Helm
Through this worlds Sea, which would us overwhelme,
And wrecke for ever, that we may at last
Gain Heavens blessed Port, and there sure Anchor cast.
Meditations of the sixth Sort.
IN fine, the Sea suggests to each good mind
These Meditations which are yet behind.
1.
First, when we see the Sea, it readily
Presents that vow and 1 Cor. 10. 2. 1 Pet. 3. 21.
Baptism to our eye,
Which make us Christians, and oblige us still
The 1 John 2. 15. 16. 17.
World, Flesh, Devil, with their Pomp, Lusts, will
Quite to renounce; and ever to obey
Gods holy Laws, who washed our sins away
In these Baptismall waters; to the Romans 6. 1. to 20. c. 14. 7. 8. Luke 1. 74.
75. Gal. 1. 4.
end
That we by sinning should no more offend
His Sacred goodness, but spend all our days
In just, good, holy actions, to his praise.
O then when ever we the waters see
Let these things to our minds recalled be,
To mend our Lives, renew our vows, and make
Us World, Flesh, Devil, and their Lusts forsake.
2.
Crosse-Seas whose boisterous Tides by turns oresway
Each other, and enforce their streams to stray
Quite from their proper course, and over-beare
Them so, that they their motions counter-steare
To that course they intend; in lively wise
A Newborn Christians state unto our Eyes
Present, in whom two Gal 5. 16. 17. 18. Romans 7. 13. to 25.
Cross Seas, Tides contend
And meet each day, contesting without end
To over-beare each other: Sometimes the
Floods of their fleshly Lusts prevailers be,
And over-beare the Spirits counter-tydes,
Which at the last prevail, put flesh besides
Its course and channel, and through heavens great might
Bear down its streams, and over-comes them quite.
3.
The floating Sea when it invades the Land,
And drownes the Coasts that next unto it stand;
Paints out that Genesis 7. and 8. 2 Pet. 2. 5. 1. Pet. 3. 20.
deluge in the days of Noy
Which did the wicked old world quite destroy.
And then instructs us with all care to fly
Those sins which 1 Timothy 6. 9. 10. Rev. 20. 10. c. 21. 8. c. 19. 20.
drown us for eternity,
Both Soul and Body in the fiery Lake.
This thought should move us, all sins to forsake.
4.
When we behold men, goods, lead, stones, Exodus 15. 5. 10.
sink down
Into the Sea, which them does quickly drown
So deep, that they can never rise again:
It paints forth Hell unto us very plain,
That sinkes, Revel. 19. 20. c. 20. 10. c. 21. 8. Mat. 25. 41. 42.
drownes, tortures, for eternity
Men's souls and bodies, which there chained lie,
So fast, so deep, that they can never rise,
Nor swim out thence: Which should us all advise,
To fly all sins; yea, more to fear and mind
This fiery Lake, whence none redemption find.
And since all fear in Seas for to be drowned,
How should they dread this Lake, that's more profound.
5.
The Sands on Sea-shores, which do far surpass
All Genesis 22. 15. c. 32. 12. Josh. 11. 4. 1 King. 7. 20. 29.
number, shows us like a Christ all glass
Those multitudes of sins that in us breed
Which do the Job. 6. 3. Psalm. 40. 10.
Sands in number far exceed,
To make us humble. And each flowing Tide,
Which does the Sand both moysten, drown and hide
From time to time, instructs us every day,
With Floods of Psalm. 6. 6. Jer. 9. 1. 18. Lam. 2. 10. 18.
tears our sins to wash away;
And in Christ's 1 John 1. 7. Mich. 7. 19.
blood them so to drown, and hide,
Through Faith, that they may be no more espide.
If thus we think, learn, do, by what we see,
From day to day, thrice happy shall we be.
6.
The springing Tide which by degrees does flow
To Full-Sea mark, and then by steps falls low,
With ships first built, then lanch'd, next rigd, then sent
And put to Sea, till they be wreckt or spent:
Paint out Man's Job 7. and 14.
birth, growth, age, death to our sight,
With all those Floodes, Ebbes, changes that do lite
Upon him from the womb unto his Urne,
Where he mere Genesis 3. 19. Eccles. 3. 20. c. 12. 7.
dust, shall unto dust return.
7.
The Genesis 7. and 8. 1 Pet. 3. 20. 21. 2 Pet. 2. 5.
Arc of old, which on the floods did floate,
And saved Noah, with each Ship and boat
Which cross the Seas, and those in safty keep
That in them sail, when others in the deep
Deprived of these, are drowned; sweetly show
To us Gods Churches State, which here below
On this worlds Sea, does Isa. 42. 2. 2 Timothy 4. 17. 18.
safely floate and ride
(Though Psalm. 109. 23. Isa. 54. 11. Job 7. 4.
tossed and torn with Tempests, Winds, and tide)
And 1 Pet. 3. 20. 21. Joh. 15. 4. 5. 6. 7. Act. 2. 47.
saves all such as in her sail and stay;
When all without, are drowned and cast away.
Let this induce us in Christ's Church to dwell,
Live, dye, for fear we drown, and sink to Hell.
8.
The vastest Sea is Jo^ 38. 8. 10. 11. Psa. 104. 9. Jer. 5. 22. Prove. 29.
bounded, and obeyes
The Laws and Edicts, which God on its lays,
As well as smallest springs, or streams: How then
Dare greatest Monarchs; Princes, Kings, or Men
Themselves deem boundless, lawless and exceed
The banks and 2 Samuel 23. 2. 3. 4. Deuteronomy. 17. 15. to 22. 2 Chronicles. 9. 8. Ps. 2.
10. 11. 12.
Laws which God to them decreed?
Let senseless Seas now teach them to contain
Within due Bounds, and not to over-straine.
9.
When Seas through winds or storms do Genesis 7. 8. 8. Neh 1. 8. 2 Pet. 2. 6.
Jer. 47. 2. Isa. 48. 2.
overflow,
Or break their banks, great mischiefs, losses grow
From thence to men and Beasts, (which then are drowned)
And all such places which they do surround:
When Kings, or great ones out of Avarice,
Pride, Lust, Ambition, or some other vice
Out-swell, or break the bounds which God has set,
A Exodus 14. 22. to 31. Josh. c. 3. to c. 14. Judge. c. 1. to 15.
Flood of woes and mischiefs they beget,
Wherein they drown themselves and many more;
And then, too late, their dismal Fates deplore.
Let Kings and Grandees then take special heed,
How they their fined Bounds break, or exceed.
10.
The Sea below does ever flow Ebb move,
As Psalm. 104. 6. to 14. c. 107. 25. 26. 29.
God himself does steare it from above:
So men on Earth, their thoughts, words, acts should frame
And Guide, as Psalm. 119. 9. Gal. 6. 16.
God above directs the same.
11.
Now waters ever stink or putrify
Whiles they within their Psalm. 104. 6. to 14.
Channels move, and lie:
But once removed out of their proper place,
Or let lie still, they stink, and lose their grace.
Thus men do seldom rot in sins, lusts, vice
Whilst they their 2 These. 3. 6. to 14. Romans 12. 6. 7. 8.
honest calling, exercise
And keep within their Compass. But if they
Grow Ezech. 16. 49. 1 Timothy 5. 12. 13. 2 These. 3. 6. to 13. Pro. 19. 15.
idle, lazy, or begin to stray
Out of their fixed Stations, in short space
They rot and stink, in Sins to their disgrace.
O then beware of sleep and idleness

When I perceive the Seas sweet flowing tide
Upon the dry Sands, shores to creep, steal, glide

Nay worse; since flowing Seas still Ebb again,
And leave the Sands dry: Sins still flow and gain

more and more
They know no Ebbes, but flow and never give over.
13.
The Ebbing Sea which all its filth behind
Leaves on the shore; should put all men in mind
How their Ebbes, and afflictions should still make
Them all their filth of sin quite to Rev. 7. 14. Dan. 11. 35. Isa. 1. 25.

Which being once cast up upon the shore,
Must Psalm. 85. 8. Hos. 14 8.
never be resumed by them more.

When I behold Our Females wash away
With water, all black spots of Ink, Soote, Clay,
Which on their faces fall by accident,
I wonder much, and cannot but lament
To see some spot their faces studiously
With Anticke Patches of a Sable dye;
Should God himself their visage thus bespot
They would repute it an uncomely Blot
A great dishonor, and use all their skill
To cure, or hide such black spots, Moles as ill:
How dare they then use Artificial spots
Which they, if native, would repute for blots
And deem a blemish to their beauty, nay
A sad ill Omen? May I not then say
Deuteronomy. 32. 5.
These spots are not the spots of Gods Children
Which make them odious to God and good Men,
Who love Job 11. 15.

What is it then to wear a spotted Face,
And that in Gods own presence? Certainly
It cannot but be sin or infamy.

Which where all is clean within, can have no place

The flowing Seas, which seem to kiss, embrace
The shore in lovely sort, yet in short space
Recoile again, and leave it naked, dry,
And faster from than to it use to fly,
Paint out in lively sort before our Eyes
Those hollow hearted friends unconstant guise
Who in the flood of Men's prosperity
Can hug, embrace, protest to live and die
Together with them, But as soon as they
Begin to Ebb, and their estates decay,
Forthwith Nah. 3. 17. Rev. 18. 10. Ps. 35. 14. 15. Psa. 41. 9. 10. Psalm. 88.

Leaving them naked in their misery.

And then draw nearest when all others fly.
16.
Few put to Sea, or come a shore, but when
It flows, not Ebbes, which Character, that Men

happy Ebbes, which mount our souls on high
And them translate from Earth above the sky:
Were it not for these Ebbes, few would arive
At heavens blessed Port, to which they most men drive.
17.
When it is full Sea at one place, it is then
Low Ebb at others, Its Just so with men:
Somes wealth, flood, greatness, others make poor, low.
And these their Ebbes, cause them to spring, rise, flow.
It Is never full Sea at once in all climes,
Nor in all men's Estates, which have their times

The Sea in Calmes, and where no Rocks, Shelves lie,
To cross its course, runs smooth without waves, cry;
But crossed by winds, storms, rocks, sands, instantly
It swells, roares, fumes, and rages furiously
Beyond all measure, caring not to split
And break it self against Rocks that hinder it:
Thus many men who seem mild, meek and sweet
Of Nature, whiles they with no winds, rubbes meet
Which Cross their Wills, designs, swell foam, 1 King. 13. 4. Dan. 3. 11. to
23.
rage, fret,
Storm, and all rules of reason quite forget.
Often in a moment, when crossed in their will
Aims, Ends, Lusts, Causes, whether good or ill;
And like some furious, Bedlams, void of wit,
Will in their fits of cholor rather split
And wrecke themselves for ever, than not have
Their wills in all things, which they seek or crave.
This Bedlam fury does too often undo
Those it possesses, if not looked unto
In time, and quite subdude, especially
Great men, or those who would be climbing high.
Let all them fly it: it is men's shame to be
As mad, rash, raging, as the Senseless Sea;
And to permit their stations to transport
Them past the bounds of reason, in this sort.
19.
When I behold men with much toil to row,
And beat the Seas oft-times when cross winds blow,
Or tides against them run till they with pain
Their wished Haven at the last obtain.
It minds me how all Christians while below
In this worlds Sea, Luke 13. 24.
should daily strive and row,
Against all winds, Tides, Storms, which cross or drive
Them from Heavens Port, till they therein arrive
In safety: which blessed Harbor none can gain
Without much 1 Cor. 9. 24 25. 26. 27.
labor, rowing; sweat, and pain.
20.
Its dangerous crossing of the Seas at night;
When neither Sun, Moon, Stars yield any light.
Hence most ships in the night are cast away
For want of light, when few are wreckt by day;
This worlds Seas are most dangerous, specially
In darkest Nights, when no light from on high
Of saving Grace or Joh. 11. 9. 10. Hos. 4. 6. Mar. 15. 14. 1 John 2. 11. Joh.
12. 35.
knowledge does appear
Within men's souls, whereby their course to steare.
Needs must men perish then for want of light
To shun Rocks, Shelves, and guide their ships aright.
We should then for this light of Grace more pray
And long, than Act. 27. 29.
Seamen in a storm for Day.
21.
The deepest Seas run silent without noise
When as the shallow, roar, lift up their voice;
With horrid rage and outcry. So we see
The deepest, wisest men most silent be,
Making least noise or bragges, and Psalm. 39. 1. 2. 9.
patiently
Under all storms and Crosses quiet lie.
When shallow Pates like 1 Cor. 13. 1.
empty vessels make
The greatest noise, bragges, and most on them take;
And being crossed, pincht with adversity,
Isa. 59. 11. c. 57. 20. 21.
Roar, rage, storm, vex like Bedlams furiously.
To brag, vaunt, rage, foame, chafe and over-prate,
Is a sure Symptom of a shallow Pate.
22.
Whiles that the Sunbeams on the Sea shine bright
They make her shine so, that she bleares the sight
And eyes of men, with those mere borrowed Rays
Which she reflects, and so to them conveyes:
But let the Sun set, or a cloud it hide,
Her shining Luster's gone, and not espide;
When as the Sunshine of prosperity
Breaks out on this 1 John 15. 2. 15. 16. 17.
worlds Sea, it bleares the eye
Of Carnal men, and makes her shine so bright
That naught to them seems half so clear, or light,
Though all her Luster be but borrowed Rays,
Which 1 Cor. 7. 31. Eccles. 1. and 2.
pass away, and in her make no stays:
As soon as Clouds or Crosses hide this Sun,
Her glory fades, and all her splendor's gone;
O dote not then upon her hired light,
Which if it lasts all day, still Psa. 49. 16. 17. 18. Jer. 15. 9. Amos 8. 9.
sets at Night.
23.
The Sea is liquid, and whiles men do think
To walkeupon it, down they fall and Psalm. 69. Mat. 14. 30. 31.
sink;
Unfaithful friends are like; whiles we rest, stay
On them, we fall, sink, and are cast away.
Try then before you trust; and Isa. 2. 22. Psalm. 146. 3. Psa. 118. 8. 9.
rest on none
Who are mere flesh, but upon God alone:
Who Psalm. 61. 8. Deuteronomy. 31. 6. Josh. 1. 5. Psalm. 27. 9. 10. Psalm. 60. 11.
never fails, when false friends from us fall
And true Friends dye, or cannot help at all.
24.
When we behold Seas constantly to flow
In spite of winds and storms which on them blow,
Twice every day; It minds us how each day
We Psalm. 92. 2. 55. 17. Ps. 53. and 56. 8. and 88. 13. Dan. 6. 10. 1 These. 5.

twice, at least, to God should duly pray,
Maugre all Winds, Storms, Sports, Works, Company,
That would us hinder from this piety.
A type whereof the Exodus 29. 39. c. 30. 7. 8. Lev. 6. 12. 20. 1 Chro. 16. 40.

In Calmes and fairest weather: we must thence
Conclude, and cry, Gods secret Act. 20. 27. 31. to 40. Psalm. 107. 24. to 31.
Isa. 22. 2. Jon. 2. 6. Psalm. 66. 12.
Providence
(The best and only Pilot) did direct
Their Helm, and them from Shipwrackes thus protect.
And learn that humane skill, Art, naught avayles
Unless God steares the Rudder, guides the Sails.
No matter then what ere the Pilot be,
If God us guide, we shall from wreckes be free.
O Let us Psalm. 78. 53. Psalm. 3. 8. 43. 2. and 68. 20.
pray to him always to steare
Our Helmes, then we no Rocks, wreckes, need to fear,
And shall sail safe, whiles others who rely
Upon their skill, not God, wrecke, split, drown, dye:
26.
When I behold sweet pleasant streams to fall
Into salt Seas at last, which drown them all.
I thereby learn, how worldly jollity,
And streams of sinful pleasures Luke 16. 25. Job 21. 11. 12. 13. Pro. 14.
13. Rev. 18. 7. 8. Amos 6. 1. to 8.

In Seas of brinish tears, in floods of grief,
And plunge men into Job 21. 12. 13. Isa. 5. 11. to 16. Luke 16. 19. to 26.
Eccl. 11. 9.
Hell past all relief.
Fly then these pleasant streams which ever end
In saltest Seas, and men post to Hell send.
27.
When Mariners or Passengers long lie
Waiting for Wind, and opportunity
To cross the Seas to those Ports, Towns, Countries
To which they bound are, they will in no wise
Let slip, but take the first good Gale; which lost
May quite undo, or put them to great cost.
Their Wisdom should instruct all those who lie
On Earth below, for passage to their high
And Heavenly Country, never to omit
One Heb. 3. 7. 8. 12. 13. 15. c. 4. 1. 11. 16.
Gale of Grace which blows well toward it,
But whiles Life, Time, and means of Grace endure
And breath upon them, to make heaven sure,
And post on to it, with full Sails each day;
For fear they Mat. 25. 9. to 12.
lose their passage through delay.
One Gale of Grace or opportunity
Neglected, may lose us eternity.

Sea waters in their Channels, are but light;
Under them all a Child may stand upright:
But taken thence, they very pondrous prove,
A Pipe or two, no Giant can remove;
Whole Seas of vastest sins are very 1 King. 16. 30. 31. 32. Eze. 26. 37.

Whereas to humbled Souls, the smallest Crimes

heavier than the Sea ten thousand times;
Wherewith their Souls, are burdened, and oppressed,
More than if Mountains lay upon their breast.
The reasons plain; in one, sins in its place;
But Hos. 14. 2. 8. Romans 6. 2. to 22.
out of it, in Hearts renude by grace.
Try then thy State hereby: if sins weigh light
In thy Souls Seals, thy case is ill, not right.

The Sea is Genesis 1. 9. 10. Psalm. 33. 7. 104. 6. to 15. Hab. 2. 14. c. 3. 15.
Job 38. 16. Isa. 60. 5.
full of waters, which there lie
Pil'd up in Heaps, as in Gods Treasury,
Or Common storehouse; who does thence disperce
Them to all Places of the Universe,
Where they are needful: Which in lively wise
Paints out most sweetly to our Hearts and Eyes,
Those inexhaust, vast, boundless Joh 1. 16. Col. 1. 19. c. 2. 9.
Magazines
Of goodness, grace, with all those golden Mines
Laid up in God and Christ, who day by day
With open Hands Psalm. 104. 21. 26. 27. 28. 145. 15. 16. Psa. 17. 14. Mat. 5. 6.
disperse, and give away
These precious stores, to every living thing
Throughout the world, and to their Homes them bring.
How should the thought of their vast stores, feast, cheer
Our hungry Souls, and banish all their fear?
Since Seas shall Hab. 3. 17. 18. 19. Psalm. 102. 26. 27. 28. Isa. 19. 4. Jer.

sooner fail of streams, and dry
Quite up, then these stores of the Diety
Fail, or diminish, which still open stand
All needful things to yield us out of hand.

above the highest Land,
Till God confined them within Banks; whence they
If but permitted, would soon escape away,
And in a moment drown the world again:
Me thinks it points out to us very plain
The patience, mercy, and Exodus 34. 6. Psalm. 103. 8. 9. 10. 11. Psalm. 86. 15. 16
abundant grace
Of our sweet God, who keeps them in their place,
Though Psalm. 7. 11. Lam. 3. 22. 23. Isa. 54. 9. 10.
daily urged by our sins, and Crimes,
To let them loose, to drown us, sundry times.
And then instructs us, him not to offend,
Who can at will whole Seas against us send,
(Yea troops of Mat. 5. 9. to 15. Luke 8. 30. to 35. Job 1. and 2.
Devils) which would soon devour
Us, if not held off by his mighty Power.

When I in Psa. 24. 2.
Scripture read, that God did found
This world on Seas and floods, ^s on its ground;
I find the cause of this Worlds 1 Cor. 7. 31. 1 John 2. 15 16. 17.

And all the things that We therein possess.
For how can ought be stable, firm or stayed,
That on unstable, floating Seas is laid?
O then make naught that this world yields, your Psalm. 62 10. 1 Timothy 6. 17.

The Sea is Homogeniall, and each small
Drop in it, has the nature of it all,
In all respects; and will not Isa. 57. 20. Jam. 3. 11.
mix, nor close
With strange or foreign things, but them oppose:
Which should instruct all Christians, to agree,
Yea in Faith, Word, and Deed but Joh. 17. 20. 21. 22. 23. Romans 12. 16. c. 15.

The Sea retains in every coast and place,
Her Native Colors, and sweet azure face.
A check and shame to that phantasticke crew

Can suite themselves to every Sect, Place, Clime;
And whiles they thus 1 Cor. 9. 20. 21. 22.
become all things to all,
In truth are nothing, and the worst of all.
34.
When angry Act. 27. 41.
Cross Seas meet and clash together
They foame, rage, roar, yea raise storms in fair weather
And toss, wrecke, or endanger all that sail
Or pass their race, and over them prevail.
When Potent Neighbor Princes, strive, war, fight
One with another, with great force and might,
Naught else but Josh. cap. 3. to 13. 2 Chronicles. 15. 5. 6. c. 36. 16. 17. 18. 19.

bloody Battles, tumults, cries,
Storms, perils to their Subjects still arise,
Which wrecke, consume their Fortunes, Goods, Lands, Lives.
And of all worldly blessings them deprives.

A CHRISTIAN PARADISE: OR A Divine Posie, Compiled of sundry Flowers of
Meditation, gathered from the Sweet and Heavenly Contemplation of the Nature,
Fruits, and Qualities of Gardens.

BY WILLIAM PRYNNE, late Exile and Close Prisoner in the Isle of Iersy.

Isaiah 61. 10. 11. I Will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my Soul shall be
joyful in my God, for he has clothed me with the Garments of Salvation, he
has covered me with the Robe of Righteousness: as a Bridegroom decketh
himself with Ornaments, and as a Bride adorneth her self with her Jewels. For
as the Earth brings forth her bud, and as the GARDEN causes the things that
are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord will cause Righteousness and
praise to spring forth before all the Nations.

Cant. 5. 1. I am come into my GARDEN my Sister, my Spouse; I have gathered my
Myrrh with my Spice; I have eaten my Honey-combe with my Honey, I have drunk
my Wine with my Milk. O Friends, drink and be drunken with love, O beloved.

Isaiah 58. 11. And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy
Soul in drought; and make fat thy bones; and thou shall be like a watered
GARDEN, and like a Spring of Water, whose waters fail not.

Of Gardens, shine forth in such radiant wise
In you sweet Mrs Douse, fair Margaret

Of Thanks, for all your Love and Courtesy

A CHRISITAN PARADISE. OR A Divine Posie, Composed of sundry Flowers of
Meditation, gathered from the sweet and Heavenly Contemplation of the Nature,
Fruits, and Qualities of Gardens.
THE PREFACE.
Soar up my Muse upon the Eagles Wings,
Above the Clouds, and scrue up all thy strings
Unto their Highest Strains, with Angels Lays
Men's Souls to ravish, and their Hearts to raise
From Earth to Heaven, with those sweetest Notes
Which Gardens tender to thy plodding thoughts.
A Theme of Meditation, so Divine,
Rich, pleasant, useful, that no golden Mine,
No Hony-Combe may once with it compare;
Lord Feast our Souls with its Celestial fare,
Fruits, pleasures in such wise, that they may still
Loath this worlds Cates, with all things that are Ill,
Tasting no Pleasure but in Things above,
The only Dainties which they ought to love.
A brief Character of a Garden.
A Garden is an Earthly Paradise,
No mortal Creatures, but Gods own devise,
( The Genesis 2. 8. 9.
first who Planted Gardens, which began
At the Creation; God then binding Man,
(The Genesis 1. 28. 29. c. 2. 8. 15.
Lord of all his works) to this sweet Trade
To Keep and Dress the Garden he had made:
This was Man's first employment; so as He
In this Respect a Gardner styled may be;
The first and best of Trades; which Genesis 3. 6. to 20.
Adams taste
Of the forbidden fruit has much debast,
And with it Gardens too, which thereby lost
Much of their Pleasure, to our Pain and cost.
Yet in this doleful State of sin, and vice;
They still remain Man's terrene Eccles. 2. 5.
Paradise;
Yielding not only Profit, but delight.
Food, Cates, Salves, Physic, Pleasures to the sight,
And other Senses; solacing the Mind
With sundry Objects which it there may find,
It, and the Body to refresh and cheer,
When as they tired, vexed, grieved are.
But this is naught to those Soule-ravishing,
Sweet, heavenly Meditations which do spring
From Gardens, able to rap and inspire
The coldest Muse, with a Celestial fire;
Yea melt the flintiest Heart, and it advance
Above the Spheres in a delightful Trance?
These make an Eden of each Garden-Plot,
And here are fallen to my Muses Lot.
Meditations of the first Kind.
1.
FIrst then, a garden paints out to our Eyes
And Hearts, its prime Genesis 2. 8. 9.
Inventor, God most wise;
Whose peerless Psalm. 104. 24. Dan. 2. 20. Pro. 3. 19. Jer. 10. 12. c. 51.
15. Ephesians. 3. 10. Col. 2. 3.
Wisdom, Art, skill shine most bright
In every Tree, Plant, Herb, Flower which our sight
Beholds in Gardens; whose variety.
In smell, taste, color, form, fruit, quality,
And useful virtues for all maladies,
Wounds, Ulcers, Aches, stripes, Infirmities
Of Man and Beast, (so many that Man's Art
Has not as yet found out the thousand part
From Adams fall till now,) at large descry
Gods matchless Art and wisdom to each eye.
View we the goodly Colors, Beauty, Frame,
Embroidry, carving, fruits, leaves, roots (which shame
And pose all Artists) with the Joints, and sweet
Proportion of those Parts, which in them meet;
And we must needs confess him Psalm. 104. 24. 1 Timothy 1. 17.
only wise
Who these rare pieces did at first devise,
Without a Pattern; and does daily raise
Such worlds of goodly Fabrickes to his praise.
O let our Hearts, words, works, still celebrate
His Psalm. 147 5. Job 36. 5 Rev. 7. 12.
boundless wisdom, who did these create.
2.
That most transcendent Beauty which we see
With daily admiration in each Tree,
Plant, Herb, Carnation, Lilly, Tulip, Rose,
With worlds of other Flowers, which the Nose
Affect with Cant. 2. 12. c. 5. 13.
pleasant smells, and beautify
The Earth and Gardens, more than stars the sky,
Shining with rarest Colors of each kind,
So fresh, mixed, sorted, that they rap the Mind
Into amazement; sweetly manifest,
In some dark measure, to each pious Breast,
Gods most surpassing Psalm. 27. 4. Psalm. 90. 17.
Beauty; to whose 1 Timothy 6. 16. 1 John 1. 5.
Light
The Noonday Suns more dark than any Night.
Why do we then like doting Fools admire
A comely Face, neck, hand, bush, brave Attire,
Or wax proud of them? (as most do,) since grass,
Trees, Mat. 6. 28. 29. Luke 12. 27 Isa. 40. 6. 7. 8.
Lillies, flowers, In beauty far Surpass
The fairest Kings Queen's, Ladies, whose hands, face
And rich Array, compared to these, are base.
O! if we dote on Beauty, let the Rays
Of 1 Timothy 6. 16.
Gods Eternal Glory, past all praise
And Comprehension, pierce, melt, rap, transport
Our Souls with Psa. 116. 1. Psalm. 73. 25. 26. Psalm. 16. 2. 5. 6. 11.
Love, and scorch them in such sort,
That they may ever burn with its sweet flame,
And deem all Beauty else not worth the Name;
Being imperfect, Isa. 40. 6. 7. 8. Psalm. 103. 15. 16. Psalm. 90. 5. 6. 7.
fading every Hour,
Not half so lovely, comely as a flower.
3.
Each Plant, Herb, Root, Grass, Flower which does grow,
In Gardens, Psalm. 104. 1. 14. 15. 16. Jer. 10. 12. 13. c. 51. 15. c. 32. 17.
Gods Almighty power forth show.
Since all the Monarchs, Artists, Men that live,
With all their might, wit, skill, can never give
Life to existence to the smallest flower.
Much less an Essence: O what little power
Is there in greatest Kings; who cannot make
One Grass, Herb, Plant, though Nestors years they take
To do it! O, what wondrous Potency
Is there in God! whose Genesis 1. and 2. Psalm. 104. 14. 15. 16. Psa. 33. 6.
word did instantly
Create all Creatures, Herbs, Trees, Plants that grow,
In Gardens, Orchards, Woods, Fields here below?
O let our Minds, when we these Creatures see,
Upon his Jer. 5^. 15. Dan. 2. 27.
mighty Power still fixed be:
Which as it Psalm. 104. 14. 15. 16. Psalm. 147. 8. Mich. 5. 7.
daily makes the fairest Trees,
Plants, Herbs, and Flowers, spring by sweet degrees
Out of the vilest dust; can likewise raise
Us from the very grave, his power to praise.
Be then our Psalm. 116. 6. Psa. 116. 6. Psa. 40. 2. 3. Jer. 32. 17. 27. Ephesians. 3.
20.
Cases, Crosses never so ill,
Take courage, God can mend them when he will;
And in due season make us spring again,
Like withered Plants, Herbs, Flowers, after rain.
4.
Gardens show forth Psalm. 33. 5. Psalm. 65. 11. Genesis 1. 11. 12. 29. 30.
Gods goodness to mankind,
Which he who sees not in them, is quite blind.
For, does not that great, sweet, variety
Of garden Plants, Fruits which delight the Eye
And other Senses; ease, help, and redress
All pains, wounds, sores, diseases that oppress
Both Man and Beast; yielding them Physic, Food,
Salves, Sauce, Cates, Cordialls, Fumes, Clothes, all that is good
Or useful for them, plainly Psalm. 104. 24. Psalm. 145. 7. 15. 16.
manifest
Gods gracious Bounty to each Man and Beast?
O what abundant Service, Psalm. 107. 8. 15. 21. Ps. 145. 7. 8. Zech 9. 17.
thanks, praise, Love,
Are due from Man unto his God above?
Who has thus stored Gardens, fields, each place,
With such great plenty of these gifts of grace?
O, let us blush that we serve, love, no more
God, who has blessed us with this happy store.
And hence conclude in our Necessity,
That this good God will Phil. 4. 19.
all our Wants supply:
He who our Gardens does with these things store,
Our Bodies, Souls, will feed, feast, fill much more.
5.
A Garden like a Glass, Gods Psalm. 104. 1. 14. 15. 16.
Providence
Reflects most clearly, to the dullest sense;
Who for Man's use and Service in each Clime,
Makes Trees, Plants, Herbs, Flowers, Seeds Cant. 7. 12. c. 2. 12. 13. Genesis
1. 11. 12. 29. 30.
spring in due time,
Which are most useful, fit to ease, heal, feed,
And help those in the countries where they breed.
And placed near him great variety
Of Herbs, Salves, Physic, for each Malady,
Both easy, cheap and ready still at hand,
If He their virtues did but understand.
O what a tender Psalm. 8. 4. Job 7. 17. 18. Ezech. 47. 12.
Care has God of Man,
Thus to provide for each disease that can,
Or does befall him, such cheap, ready Cures!
O Psalm. 145. 1. 2. 7. 21.
praise him for this care which still endures.
And since that He our wealth does so respect,
Let us Deuteronomy. 6. 12. c. 8. 11.
take heed, we never him neglect;
Nor yet our selves, but thankefully Isa. 38. 21. Ezech. 47. 12. 2 King. 8. 29.
make use
Of what may to our Health, or ease conduce.
Lord, when we walk in Gardens to delight
Our minds, or senses, let the sweetest sight
Of Thee, and these thy Attributes, which they
Present most clearly to us day by day;
Rap up our Souls into such Ecstasies,
That they naught else but Thee; may love or prise.
Meditations of the second Rank.
MOreover Gardens lively represent
Christ to our Eyes and Minds, with blessed content.
1.
For first, as Gardens, yield all Genesis 2. 8. to 17. Eccles. 2. 5. Jer. 29. 5.
28. Cant. 4. 16. c. 5. 1. 2. c. 6. 2. 3. 11.
rarities
And pleasant Objects to delight the Eyes
And other Senses; so all pleasant, sound
Soule-chearing 2 Cor. 1. 3. 4. 5. 6. Phil. 2. 7. 8. 9. Heb. 10. 33. 34.
Comforts, Joys in Christ are found.
Our Hearts to solace; whence most sweetness springs
When we taste naught but Gall in other things:
O blessed Jesus such Soul ravishing
Groves, streams of 2 Cor. 1. 3. 4. 5. 6.
sweetest Cordialls from Thee spring
To cheer our drooping Souls in all distress,
That did they once but Psalm. 34. 8
taste their lushiousnesse,
And more than Honey sweetness, they would be
Rapt and Psa. 73. 25. Cant. 2. 5. c. 5. 8.
inamor'd with naught else but Thee.
O let me feel how good, how sweet thou art.
Then thou alone shall feast, fill, have mine Heart.
2.
Again, as fruitful Gardens bring sorth store
Of Ezech. 47. 12. Deuteronomy. 11. 10 1 King. 21. 2. Genesis 2. 9.
Herbs, Receites, for every Sickness, sore,
Wound, Ulcer, Ache that happens to Mankind.
So in our Isa. 53. 4. 5. 6. 1 John 1. 7. c. 2. 2. Rev. 1. 5.
Savior Christ, our Souls may find
A Sovereign Herb, Balm, Salve for to appease
Help, heal, each sore, wound, ulcer, ach, disease
That does or can them any times annoy,
Grieve, pain, perplex, or threate them to destroy:
Are then our Souls sick, wounded, like to dye
With any sin, or deadly Malady;
O let us then Mat. 11. 28. 29. c. 9. 11. 13. 1 Timothy 1. 15.
resort to Christ with speed,
For Herbs, Salves, Physic, all else that we need;
Whose 1 John 1. 7. Rev. 1. 5. Heb. 9. 14.
Blood's a royal Balm, receipt to save
All Souls which from it help, health, Physic crave.
3.
Gardens still yield a pleasant fragrant Genesis 27. 27 Hos. 14. 6. Cant. 2. 13.
c. 4. 11. c. 7. 13.
smell,
And rich perfumes; Christ does them far excel
In his Cant. 1. 3. 12. 13. 14. Ephesians. 5. 2. Cant. 5. 5. 13. Rev. 8. 3. 4.
sweete-smelling Odors, which ascend
Into Gods Sacred Nostrells, to amend
Perfume and sweeten, all those stinking, sour,
Unsavory Prayers, which to God we power,
In Christ's sweet Name; whose horrid sent and stink
(More Loath-some than the vilest kennell, sink,)
Would else so much Isa. 64. 6.
offend his Sacred Nose
That he both it, and his Ears too would close
Against them; yea Isa. 1. 13. 14. 15. Pro. 28. 9.
detest, both them and us;
Where now these Odors make them gracious,
Far Rev. 8. 3. 4.
sweeter than the richest sent that can
Be found out, to delight the Nose of Man.
And as Christ's fragrant perfumes far excel
The sweetest Incense, in his Fathers smell,
So do they likewise in the sent of those
Whom he has chosen; to whose Sacred Nose
The fragrant'st Odors matched with Cant. 1. 3. 12. 13. 14.
Christ's are stink
And more unsavory than the foulest sink:
Sweet Jesus let thy pleasant perfumes move,
And ravish all our Souls, with thy sweet Love.
4.
Gardens have pleasant Genesis 2. 10. Isa. 53. 11. Cant. 4. 15.
Fountains, where we may
Our bodies bathe, and wash their filth away,
Yea quench our thirst, our heates cool, and revive
Those Trees, Herbs, Plants that fade, and make them thrive.
Christ has a pleasant Isa. 55. 1 John 7. 37. 38. c. 4. 13. 4. 15. Jer. 2. 13.
Zech. 13. 1. Rev. 1. 5. 1 John 1. 7.
Fountain, Spring, or Well
Of sweet and living waters, that excel
All others, springing in him, where we may
Bathe, cool, refresh our Souls, and wash away
The filth of all our sins; and eke revive
Our withering Graces, and them cause to thrive.
Lord ever ba the our Souls in this blessed spring,
Which will both Health, Joy, safty to them bring.

As far surpass all Cates that Gardens bear;
No Honey, Marrow, Manna may compare
With his rare sweete-meates, and Celestial Fare.
O come and Psalm. 34. 8.

Then will we long to feast with None but He.

Gardens are fraught with Arbors, Trees, whose Psalm. 80. 10. Hos. 4. 13. Jon.

Against all scalding Heates, all storms we meet,
Yea from his Fathers burning Wrath and Rage,
Which none but he can quench, cool, or assuage:
O then in all such scorching Flames still fly
To Christ's sweet shade, for ease and remedy.
7.
Gardens are full of Genesis 2. 8. to 17. c. 3. 1. 2. 3. Cant. 5. 1. c. 6. 2.
Eccle. 2. 5.
beauty and delight
And so is Christ in all his chosen's sight;
None half so Cant. 5. 9. 10. 11.
comely, Lovely, fair as He,
In whom we naught but comeliness can see.
O let his beauty Cant. 5. 4. to 16. c. 8. 6. 7. Romans 8. 38. 39.
kindle such a fire
In all our Soul, as never shall expire;
And may consume all flames of lustful Love,
Wedding us only unto Christ above.
8.
Gardens are ever rich and fruitful ground;
All useful Herbs, Genesis 2. 8. to 16. Isa. 51. 3. c. 61. 11. Ezech. 28. 13. c.

best, prime piece of all Mankind,
In whom alone all good things we may find
At any season, in such copious store,
As will suffice mankind for evermore.
O then Isa. 55. 1. 2. Jam. 1. 5. Joh. 1. 16.
resort to him for every thing
We want, in whom all good things grow and spring.
9.
The Seeds, Plants, Roots which we would have to grow.
In Gardens, we Genesis 28. Isa. 61. 11. Luke 13. 19.
there bury, set, or sow:
So Christ that he might grow and fructify, Joh. 19. 41. 42.

Within a Joh. 20. 1. to 18.
Garden did intombed lie,
Where Mat. 28. 19. Mar. 16. 15. Col. 1. 5. 6. 23. Romans 10. 18. Rev. 14. 6.

He filled the Mat. 28. 19. Mar. 16. 15. Col. 1. 5. 6. 23. Romans 10. 18. Rev. 14.
6. Psalm. 19. 4.
world with his increased train;
Which Jury only did confine before,
But now the world, which scarce conteines his store.
10.
Christ, here on earth did Gardens highly grace
Joh. 18. 1. 2. 3. 26. c. 19. 41. 42. c. 20. 1. to 18.
Resorting often unto them, in which place
He was betrayed, entombed, raised up, and then
First there appeared to Mary Magdalen.
Each Garden then we see, should still present
Christ to our sight, minds, thoughts, with sweet Content;
Wherein with Eyes of Faith, we may behold
Christ walking with us, as he Joh. 18. 1. 2.
walked of old
With his Disciples, to instruct, joy, cheer,
Our blind, sad Hearts, and banish all their fear:
Here may we view false Joh. 18. 3. to 18.
Judas, him betray,
With fained kisses; and thence lead away
With Bands of Catch-poles, armed with, Swords, Bills, staves;
To teach us to beware such flattering Knaves,
Who are most treacherous when they seem most kind:
And that a Judas we shall ever find
Amidst Christ's choice Apostles; who for gain
Will both betray Christ, and his chosen train,
And them in their sweet Gardens trap, surprise,
Where they no danger saw, nor could devise:
Here, may we eye Joh. 19. 41. 42.
Christ lying in his Tomb
To sweeten death, and all our graves perfume.
Here may we see him Joh. 20. 1. to 18. 1 Cor. 15. 54. 55. 56. 57.
rise up the third day
To conquer Death, and take his sting away,
Leading him Captive in triumphant wise
That we might learn his terrors to despise,
And never dread this 1 Cor. 15. 54. Romans 6. 9. 10. 11.
vanquished Enemy,
Who kills us once to live eternally.
Here may we view our Bodies, by Job 19. 25. 26. 27. 1 Cor. 15. 20. to 56. 1
These. 4. 13. to 18. Romans 6. 9. 10. 11.
death slain
And turned to Dust, by Christ raised up again
In glorious state, to live in Endless Joy
Above Deaths reach, and all them can annoy.
Here may we find our Savior still appear
From day to day, our drooping Hearts to cheer,
In each root, seed, plant, herb, which shall arise
Out of the Earth; which Romans 1. 19. 20. 21.
shows him to our eyes;
What need of Popish Pictures then to bring
Christ to our Eyes, minds, thoughts? since every thing,
Plant, Herb that in our Gardens sprouts, lives, grows,
His life, Death, rising, far more clearly shows?
Isa. 2. 20. c. 30. 22. c. 31. 7.
Away then with these Cursed Idols; we
Christ no where else will ever seek, view, see
But in his Gal. 3. 1. 1 Cor. 10. 3. 4. c. 11. 24. 25.
Word, Works, Sacraments, wherein
We only can behold him, without sin;
And when we long him, or his Acts to Eye,
If Bibles fail, each Garden will descry
Them to us, in more sweet and lively wise,
Than all the Pictures Papists can devise.
Blessed Lord Jesus when we ever walk
Within a Garden, Let us with thee talk,
In such sweet Contemplations, and delight
Our Souls, Eyes, Senses with thy blessed sight,
Which every Garden Tree, Plant, Herb, Flower, Grass,
Reflects more clearly than a Crystal Glass:
Then shall each Garden which we view or see,
A blessed second Ezech. 28. 13.
Eden to us be.
Meditations of the third Class.
A Garden is a Map of Paradise,
The plot, Genesis 2. 8. 9.
from whence all Gardens took their rise.
Compared, they suite, and make an Harmony,
Which cheares our Souls with its sweet melody.
1.
For first, as God did Genesis 1. 8. to 16. c. 3. 1. 2.
Eden Plant, deck, fill
With choycest Trees, Herbs, Fruits; so men do still
Their Deuteronomy. 11. 10 Can. 6. 2. 3. 11. to 16. c. 5. 1. 2.
Gardens with these daily deck, store, grace,
And more enrich, than any other place.
2.
Eden was full of Genesis 2. 8. to 16. Isa. 51. 3.
pleasure and delight
Of goodly Trees, Flowers, Fruits to please the sight,
And Palate: So are Eccles. 2. 5 Cant. 5. 1. 2. c. 6. 2. 11.
Gardens, where we find
Most pleasant objects both for Eye, Mouth, Mind.
3.
Eden was very Isa. 51. 3. Joel. 2. 3. Genesis 13. 10.
fruitful: Gardens are
The Isa. 58. 11.
fertil'st plots, and most Fruits ever bear.
4.
Eden was seated close by Genesis 2. 9. 10. 11. 12.
Rivers sides,
And watered with their Crystal streams and tides;
Thus are most Isa. 58. 11. Number. 24. 6. Cant. 4. 5.
Gardens seated, that they may
Become more fruitful, pleasant, green, fresh, gay.
5.
Eden was kept and dressed by Genesis 2. 15. 16.
Adam, who
Was bound by God this task to undergo.
And who but Joh. 20. 15. Jer. 29. 5. 28. Amos 9. 14.
Men, do yet still keep and dress
Those pleasant Gardens which we here possess?
Beasts, Horses, Oxen, help to till our ground,
Fit to dress Gardens, only Men are found.
Hence may we learn that God Ezech. 16. 49. Mat. 20. 3. 6. 1 Timothy 5. 13. 1
These. 4. 11. 2 These. 3. 6. to 16. Exodus 20. 9.
hates Idleness
In all estates, who ought still to address
Themselves to some good honest work, Art, trade,
Since Adams Genesis 2. 15. c. 3. 13.
set to work as soon as made;
Though the sole Monarch of the world, and all
The Creatures in it; which before the fall
Were at his mere Command, and did afford
Him all he needed, Genesis 1. 26.
of their own accord.
6.
God had no sooner Adam made, but He
Him Genesis 2. 8. to 17. c. 3. 1. to 7. Isa. 51. 3.
placed in Eden, happy there to be,
As in the choycest, fruitefulst, pleasant'st plot
This lower world could unto him alot.
All take delight in Cant. 5. 1. c. 6. 2. 11. c. 8. 13.
Gardens to reside,
The only Edens where they would abide:
Whence all who have but one small piece or plot,
Of Earth, will to a Jer. 19. 5. 18. Amos 9. 14.
Garden it alot.
7.
Man entered Genesis 2. 15. to 25. c. 3. 1. 2.
into Eden void of sin;
O let us think of this, when we begin
Our Garden doors to enter, that we may
Avoid all sin, which Romans 5. 12. 13. 14.
mankind first did slay;
And daily strive to be as Innocent
As Adam, when he into Eden went.
8.
The Tree of Knowledge (which did typifie
Christ, or his Sacred Word to Adams Eye,)
In Genesis 2. 3. 16. Rev. 2. 7.
midst of Eden stood: Thus each Plant, Tree
Which we in midst of Gardens chance to see,
Christ and his Sacred Word in lively wise
Present, show, point out to our minds and Eyes.
9.
Eden a Genesis 3. 1. to 16. 2 Cor. 11. 3. 1 Timothy 2. 24.
Serpent had which did betray
First Eve, then Adam, and them cast away
By his Temptations, their Credulity.
No wonder then if we sometimes epsy
Not only Weeds, but Serpents, Adders, Snakes,
Toades, and such vermin (whose mere aspect makes
Most men to tremble) in our Garden-plots,
To make us fear that 2 Timothy 2. 26. 2 Cor. 11. 3.
Serpent, which besots,
Betrays, and stings us still through pleasures, vice.
As he did Adam in old Pardise:
O let us then in no place rest secure;
Since he in Eden did Man first allure.
Much less in pleasant Isa. 1. 29. c. 65. 3. c. 66. 17. Cant. 5. 1. c. 6. 2.
Gardens, where he still
Tempts Men and Women often times unto ill:
10.
The Genesis 3. 1. to 16.
first and Mother sin, from whence all vice
Sins, mischiefs spring, was hatched in Paradise:
Here Father Adam caught that breake-necke fall,
Which in a moment quite undid us all.
O let our Gardens put us still in mind
Of this great sin, whose relics we still find
Remaining in us: and let every weed
We see in Gardens, cause us to take heed
That no one sin within us ever spring,
To work our ruin, or our souls to sting.
11.
Man had no sooner sinned, but God Genesis 3. 8. to 24.
cast
Him out of Eden, and then laid it waste;
Cursing the Earth with thorns, Weeds, Barrenness
For his offense, which he before did bless:
When then our Gardens, weedie, barren grow
Think of the cause from whence these evils flow,
(Our sin; Gods curse:) and when we enter in,
Or issue out of Gardens, let that sin
Which moved God mankind first to exclude.
From Edens bliss, with tears be of us rude.
We cannot over-ponder or lament
That sin which Man out of his Eden sent.
And learn from hence, that none gain ought by vice,
Or Rev. 22. 14. 15.
sin, at Last, but loss of Paradise.
12.
Man banished Eden for his wilful sin,
Was ever after Genesis ^. 22. 23. 24.
barred from entering in
Again, by a bright sword with fiery flame
Which turned every way to guard the same.
The hedges, pales, walls, doors, that close and fence
Our gardens, to keep Men and beasts from thence,
Should ever mind us of this sword, that vice,
Which thrust and kept man out of Paradise:
And teach us with all care, pains, industry,
To strive to enter 2 Cor. 12. 4. Rev. 2. 7.
Eden that is on high.
Since we are thus excluded this below,
The very place whereof none this day know;
13.
Man's loss in Edens Garden, might affright
Us all, and dampe the joy, mirth, and delight,
Which Gardens yield; yea had not Christ repaird,
What man there lost, we should have quite despaird.
But now take courage and no more complain;
Christ in a garden has restored again
What Adam therein lost; that we might all
Be there repaired, where first we caught our fall:
Which that I may with sweeter fruit declare,
I Will Christ with Adam; place with place compare.
1.
Adam at first in Eden was Genesis 3. 1. to 9.
betrayed,
And trap't by those snares which the Serpent laid.
Christ in a Garden was betrayed, and snared
By Judas, Joh. 18. 1. to. 16.
and those troops which he prepared.
2.
Adam in Eden Genesis 3. 1. to 24.
caught that break-necke fall
Which in a moment did undo us all:
Christ in a Joh. 19. 41. 42. Romans 6. 1. to 12.
Garden took his lowest fall
Into the grave, which raised and made us all.
3.
Adam there fell in Genesis 3. Romans 5. 12. 13. 14.
state of Innocence,
And wreckt us all, by this his prime offense:
Christ in Joh. 18. 1. to 16. c. 19. 41. 42. Romans 6. 7. 8. 9.
a garden fell, though free from fault,
To make us guiltless, and our state exalt.
4.
Adam Romans 5. 12. 13.
by sin, Christ Isa. 53. 4. to 12. Romans 4. 25.
for sins only fell:
He for his own; Christ, for those in us dwell.
5.
Adam fell Genesis 3. 22. 23, 24.
flat, but could not rise again:
Christ fell Act. 2. 24. to 37.
but rose, naught could him down detain.
6.
His fall himself, with all Romans 5. 12. to 20. 1 Cor. 15. 22.
his race down threw:
Christ's fall him raised, with all his chosen crew.
7.
He in a Genesis 3. Joh. 19. 41, 42. c. 20. 1. to 12.
Garden fell; there Christ arose
To save man there, where he himself did lose.
8.
Adam there falling, did Genesis 3. 19. Romans 5. 8, 9.
corruption bring
Unto himself, and all who from him spring:
Christ dead and buried here, did Act. 2. 24. to 36. c. 13. 34. 35. 37. 1 Cor.
15. 50. 52, 53. 54.
never see
Corruption, and all his did from it free.
9.
He fell in Eden Genesis 3. 1. to 12.
by the tree of life
Of which he ate, allured by his wife:
Which tree (that in the Genesis 2. 9.
midst of Eden grew)
Instead of giving life Romans 5. 7, 8, 9. etc.
him and us slew.
We by our Joh. 6. 50. 51. 54. 57, 58.
eating of this blessed tree
Of life, Christ Jesus, are thereby made free
From death and hell, who planted was, and lay
Joh. 19. 41. 42.
Entombed amidst a garden, 1 Cor. 15. 54, 55, 57.
death to slay:
10.
Adam was Genesis 3. 22.
thrust from Eden to his loss:
Christ from a Joh. 18. 1. 2. to 16.
Garden lead was to his Cross.
11.
He Genesis 3. 22, 23, 24.
banished Eden, could return no more,
Christ all his chosen thither to restore,
Dragged Joh. 18. 1. 2. c. 19. 41, 42.
from a garden, was brought back again
And there entombed, as soon as he was slain.
12.
In Eden Genesis 3. 3. to 18. Romans 5. 7. to 16.
death against man first prevailed:
Death in a Joh. 19. 41. 42. c. 20. 1. to 17.
Garden was by Christ first quail'd:
Here he arose again from death: and then
Appeared there first to Mary Magdalen.
Winning the field of Deaths, Sins, Devils Host,
In that same place where Adam first it lost:
And there triumphed over all this Sect,
Where they their Trophies did at first erect.
Needs must our Gardens then be very sweet,
And pleasant, where these acts of Christ all meet:
Which rightly pondred by us, in a trice,
Would change each Garden to a Paradise,
And make us see, that we by Christ gain more
In Gardens now, than Adam lost before.
Sweet Jesus when a Garden we epsy
Rap thou our souls into an ecstasy.
With these, or such like pious Thoughts; that we
An Eden in each Garden-plot may see;
And feel a blessed Heaven still to grow,
Within our souls, whiles we are here below.
Meditations of the fourth Class.
Again; me thinks a Garden Gods blessed Word
Does well resemble, and therewith accord.
1.
For first as Genesis 27 27. Hosea 14. 6.
Gardens yield most fragrant smells,
So Gods dear Word in Cant. 5. 16. 2 Cor. 2. 15.
sweetness far excels:
Its rich perfumes, and odours still entice
His Saints to Ps. 119. 97. 47. 48. 72. 111. 112 113. 127. 140. 159. 167.
love it, in most ardent wise.
O let our Deuteronomy. 6. 6. 7. 8. 9. c. 11. 18. 19. 20. Ps. 119. 97.
houses, words, thoughts, acts, lives, smell
Of it is sweet odors, which all else excel.
2.
Cant. 5. 1. 2. 3. 1 King. 21. 2.
Gardens yield store of pleasant fruits, roots, cates,
Herbs, sallads, cordials, fit for all estates,
To feed, feast, please their pallats, and to cheer
Their drooping hearts, oppressed with pain, grief, fear.
Gods blessed word is stored with 2 Pet. 1. 3. 4. 2 Cor. 1. 4. 20. Romans 15. 4.
9. 10. Ps. 19. 8. 10. Ps. 119. 72. 127. Ier. 15. 16.
promises,
Which feed, feast, cheer, the hearts of all degrees:
And are more pleasant, cordial, sweet, and dear
To drooping souls, than all this worlds best cheer.
O let us daily solace, fat, feast, fill,
Our souls with these blessed cates, and cheer them still.
3.
As Gardens so the Scriptures yield great store,
Of Psalm. 42. 4. to the end. Ps. 43. 5. Isa 1. 5. 6. to 21. Act. 3. 19. 1 John
1. 7.
salves, and good receipts for every sore,
Wound, sickness, grief, which men's souls can affect,
No hope of health, for those who them neglect.
O let us prise these balmes, which souls can cure,
If they be healed the bodies safe and sure.
4.
Gardens are full of all Genesis 2. 8. to 16. Cant. 6. 2. c. 5. 1. 2.
variety
Of flowers, herbs, fruits which delight the eye.
And bring most sweet refreshment and content,
To such as are to meditation bent,
Yea all of all sorts: So Gods sacred word
To all of all ranks, can and does afford
A copious store, and sweet variety
Of 2 Pet. 1. 3. 4. 1 Timothy 3. 16. Heb. 6. 12.
great and precious promises, which lie
Dispersed in it, to refresh, joy, ease
All sad dejected souls, and them appease.
O with what pleasure, joy, and blessed delight,
May tired drooping souls, both day and night
Walk in the midst of this sweet Paradise,
Where all refreshing comforts grow and rise?
Let these be still our Psalm. 1. 2. Psalm. 119. 97. Deuteronomy. 6. 6, 7, 8, 9. c. 17.
19. Josh. 1. 8.
study, night and day,
Which all our griefs, fears, sins will chase away.
5.
All Cant. 5. 1. c. 6. 2. 11.
Gardens sweet refreshment still afford
To tired bodies, spirits: So Gods word
To Isa. 40. 1. 2. c. 61. 1. 2. 3. c. 26. 20. Romans 15. 4.
weary souls oppressed with sin, and spent
With grief, yields sweet refreshment and content:
Here may they find blessed rest, repose, and ease,
When naught else can them comfort or appease.
O let our souls for ever dwell and rest
In its refreshing shade, which makes them blessed.
6.
Gardens Cant. 4. 12. Isa. 5. 1.
enclosed are, Gods word is so,
Within his Romans 3. 2. 1 Timothy 3. 15. Isa. 6. 16.
Churches pale: there must we go
To seek and find it; since the Church does keep,
And show the Scriptures to Christ's chosen sheep;
But not confirm or give authority
To them, who do Romans 2. 16. Ephesians. 2. 20.
her judge, surport, and try.
7.
Gardens are Jer. 39. 4. c. 52. 7. c. 29. 5. 18 Amos 9 14.
Common both to rich and poor,
To all of all sorts: So the Scriptures door
Is shut to none, but open stands to Mat. 28. 19. 20. Mar. 6. 15.
all
Degrees of men: to rich, poor, great, and small.
Yea Luke 4. 18. c. 7. 22. Mat. 11. 5. Jam. 2. 5. 6. 2 Cor. 9. 9.
pooremen (most part) have a greater share
In this rich Garden, than the great'st that are.
8.
Gardens are fruitful, and make all things Isa. 61. 11.
grow,
That men in season in them plant, or sow:
Gods word is fertile too, and Col. 1. 6. Act. 19. 20. 1 These. 1. 5. to the end.
makes men spring,
Grow, thrive in grace, and much fruit forth to bring.
9.
Gardens most sweetly picture to our eyes
Minds, thoughts, God, Christ, and man in livelywise:
Thus do the Joh. 5. 39. 2 Pet. 1. 2. 4. 19. Ephesians. 2. 8. to 13. c. 2. 12. 13.
Ps. 39. 5. 6.
Scriptures too, in far more bright
And perfect colors paint them to our sight.
He who would these exactly know and see,
Must on the Scriptures always looking be.
10.
Gardens are full of objects, whence we may
Sweet Psalm. 143. 5. Ps. 104. Isa 40. 6, 7, 8. c. 61. 11.
contemplations raise from day to day,
To make us better, and translate our love
From earth to heaven, and the Col. 3. 1, 2, 3.
things above:
So are the Scriptures. O thrice happy they
Who Psalm. 1. 1. 2.
meditate still in them night and day,
To mend their lives, hearts, souls, and elevate
Them from an earthly, to an heavenly state.
All other Act. 19. 19. Col. 2. 8.
studies, Joh. 17. 3. Jer. 23. 28, 29. 1 Pet. 1. 23. 25. Psalm. 119. Psalm. 19.
7. to 14.
matched with these, are base,
And leave the soul but in a damned case.
Only the Scriptures make us truly blessed,
And guide our souls unto eternal rest.
11.
Lord let us daily more and more discry
The sacred Scriptures worth and dignity;
Our souls to cheer, feast, ravish with their love,
That we our words, thoughts acts may guide and move,
As they direct, and let each Gardens sight
Present them to our thoughts with sweet delight.
That while we view this leaf of natures book,
We may more clearly into Gods book look;
Romans 1. 19. 20. 21. Act. 14. 17. c. 17. 24. to 31.
The one whereof gives to the other light:
And both conjoined, will yield more sweet delight.
Meditations of the fifth Sort.
Again, in Gardens we may view and find
A lively map and picture of mankind;
And day by day both in them read and see
The story of our selves, and what we be.
1.
For first those Luke 13. 19.
seeds, which we in gardens saw:
And bury in their wombes that they may grow,
And spring up thence: present unto our eyes
That Genesis 38. 8. 9
humane seed, from which we all arise,
And sprout: at first sown, planted in the womb,
And there interred, as in a Garden tomb,
Till it be quickened formed and made fit
To come into the World, and break from it.
2.
Each seed, root, plant we see in Gardens spring,
And peep out of the earth, does sweetly bring
Unto our minds, and shadows to our eyes
Man's birth into this world, in lively-wise:
Who Genesis 38. 28, 29. 30.
breaks, and creepes out from his mothers womb,
Like seed out of the earth, that he may come
Into this wretched world, whose misery
As soon as borne, still makes him weep and cry.
3.
The weak young tender blades, and sprouts that grow,
Up first from seeds, roots, plants, do lively, show
Unto our eyes and thoughts, man's infancy
Who Ezech. 16. 4, 5. Exodus 2. 6.
cannot stand or go, but crawle and lie
Upon the ground, like blades, grass, sprigs new thrust
Out of the earth, which lean, lie on the dust.
4.
Their further growth in strength, height, breadth, each day;
Man's Genesis 21. 8. 12. c. 25. 27. Judge. 13. 24.
daily growth in all these, well display;
Until his youth out-grows his infancy,
By senseless steps, and make him sprout up high.
5.
Their progress till they blossom and forth bring
Gay, goodly, lovely, sweet flowers in the spring,
And Summer season, aptly typifie
Our fresh, sweet 1 Cor. 7. 36.
flowring youth, which in each eye
Makes us as comely, lovely, fresh, and gay,
As garden-trees, flowers in the month of May;
Though still as Isa. 40. 6, 7. 8. 1 Pet. 1. 20. Psalm. 102. 11. Psalm. 103. 15.
Ps. 90. 5, 6. Jam. 1, 10. Job. 14. 2.
fading as the tendrest flower,
Often cropped and withered in less than one hour.
6.
Their next succeeding fruits and seeds, express
Our riper years, and age of fruitfulness;
Number. 1. 3. 18. c. 4. 3. 1 Timothy 3. 4, 5, 6. 2 Chr. 10. 6. to 12.
Fit for employment, and the practicke part
Of any science, calling, trade, skill, art,
Or public office in the Church, or State:
For which our youth's too soon, our age too late.
7.
Their full ripe Leaves, fruits seeds, which bend, and Isa 34. 4. c. 64. 4.
fall
Unto the earth at last; may mind us all
Of man's old age, which will him Eccles. 12. 2, 3, 4.
bow, then cast,
Or bring quite down unto the Genesis 3. 19.
dust at last,
From whence he sprung, and uses to 2 Samuel 19. 31, 35, 35. 1 King. 1. 1. Genesis
27. 1.
decay
His strength, teeth, senses, parts, which fall away
As leaves, seeds, fruits in autumn: and him make
Like withered stalks, which leaves, seeds, fruits forsake;
Before his aged shriv'led Body dies,
Whilst it weak, bedridden, senseless, halfe-dead lies.
8.
The Zech. 11. 2.
falling of their withred stalks, trunkes, boughs,
Unto the earth at last; most lively shows,
That our Job 5. 26.
old age, it self will kill us all
At last, and make us dead to earth to fall,
Though near so healthy, wealthy, mighty, strong:
And that, if naught else kill us, Genesis 5. 5. to 32.
living long
Will do it: a disease which none can cure:
If others escape, old men to dye are sure.
9.
The buring of these old stalks, leaves again,
When fallen down on the earth, shows forth most plain,
Before our eyes, our funerals, when we
Quite dead and withered, shall Genesis 23. 4. to 20. c. 47. 30.
interred be,
And shut close prisoners in our mother Genesis 3. 19.
earths
Dark womb, from whence at first we had our births.
10.
Their rotting there, and turning into dust;
Instructs us how the grave shall rot and rust
Our corpse, and turn them into Genesis 3. 19. Eccles. 3. 10. c. 12. 7.
dust at last,
Since God such sentence has against them past.
11.
The seeds which drop into the earth, and there
1 Cor. 15. 36, 37, 38. to 55. 1 These. 4. 13. to 18. Job. 19. 25, 26, 27.
Rot for a time, but yet again appear,
And spring afresh, more glorious than before,
And by their rising much increase their store:
Demonstrate to us in most pregnant wise,
How our dead rotten Corpse again shall rise
Out of the dust, and graves wherein they lie,
In greater vigor, glory, dignity.
Then ever they enjoyed; and gain far more
By rising, than by death they lost before.
O let this arm us against all the fear
Of death or grave, and still us joy and cheer.
12.
When we behold some Ps. 90. 5, 6. Ps. 103. 15. 16. Psalm. 129. 6.
tender bud or blade,
Nipt with the frost, winds, storms, to fall and fade
So soon as shot forth: we may learn thereby
How men often times even in their Eccles. 4. 3. Job. 3. 11. 16. 21. c. 10. 18.
19.
infancy
As soon as borne, yea sometimes in the womb
Are nipt and cropped by death, and to their Tomb
Depart from hence so soon, so suddenly,
As if they were borne only for to dye.
Let younglings then, as well as old prepare
For death, from which Isa. 40. 6, 7, 8. Heb. 9. 27.
none un-exempted are.
13.
When as we view the Psalm. 103. 15, 16. Isa. 40. 6, 7, 8. Job. 14. 1, 2. Isa.
28. 1. 4. Jam. 1. 11. 1 Pet. 1. 24.
bravest, fairest flowers
Cropped, blasted, withred, vanished in few hours:
We may therefrom contemplate, how that we
By sudden death often blasted, withred be,
Cropped off, consumed in few minutes space,
Even in the flower, prime, pride, choice, vigor, grace
Of all our days, when Isa. 28. 15. 18.
death from us did seem
The farthest off, and we did not once dream
Of its approach. A truth we daily see,
Which should teach youth, for death prepared to be.
14,
The ripe fruits, seeds which we in gardens view,
Plucked off, and gathered; clearly to us show
How Job. 5. 26.
men of ripe years, are most commonly,
Pulled off by death, and so should look to dye,
At least as soon as ripe, if not before,
Since then they stand near unto grim deaths door,
Whom if he spare to pull or shake down, they
Will of themselves in short space fall away,
And drop into his mouth. Let then all such
Stand Job. 14. 14. Genesis 27. 2.
still prepared for death, who does them touch.
15.
Each seed, fruits, leaf, flower, blossom we see fall,
Fade, rot within our Gardens Isa. 1. 30. c. 34. 4. c. 40. 6, 7, 8. c. 64. 6.
Job. 14. 1, 2. Heb. 9. 27.
show how all
Mankind must fade, fall, rot, and dye like these
Each in his time, and perish by degrees;
And that no age, sex, calling, state is free
From death, to which they ever subject be:
And so should teach all to Psalm. 90. 5. 6. 12 Ps. 39. 4. 5. 12.
account each day
Their last, wherein they look to pass away.
16.
Each Garden in the years four seasons paints
Forth to our eyes, and us full well acquaints
With man's four ages, which do comprehend
The whole race of his life, until it end.
In Psalm. 38. 35, 36. Ps. 92. 7.
spring time they depaint our infancy,
And younger years: in summer they descry
Our youthful flowring age. In Autumn they
Our riper years, and drooping age display;

winter when they shriveled, naked are,
And all amort, decayed: they then declare
Our old decrepid, withred, dying years,
When, all within us, dead, naught fresh appears,
We can no time then in our gardens be,
But we our selves may there read, know, view, see,
By contemplation, in more complete wise
Than in all pictures painters can devise.
O let us view our selves in this bright glass
Each day, and Psalm. 90. 9, 10.
see there how our ages pass,
And slit away, until we wither, dye;
To Deuteronomy 32. 29.
mind us still of our mortality:
17.
Besides, by meditation we may hence
Behold, mind, know our state of innocence
Before our fall: since God did Cen. 2. 8. to 17.
Adam place
In Edens garden, in a state of Grace,
And Innocence, it both to keep and dress,
Where he not long enjoyed this happiness.
18.
Yea, in our Gardens we may read and eye
Our fall and state of sin and misery,
Since we in Genesis 3. Romans 5. 8, 9. etc.
Edens Garden caught that fall
Through Adams sin, which did undo us all,
And Romans 7. 8. to 25. c. 9. 12.
plunge us into such a woeful state
Of sin, and vice, as makes God us to hate;
And daily Romans 1. 25. to 32. c. 7, 8, to 25. Jam. 1. 13, 14, 15.
spurs us unto all excess
Of horrid sins, and monstrous wickedness;
Which Psalm. 9. 17. Mat. 25. 41. 46.
cast us headlong into hell, and make
Us naught but fuel for that fiery Lake,
A dismal state indeed, whose thought should rent
Our stony hearts, and cause them to relent.
19.
But not despair, since in this very place
Christ has restored us to a state of grace,
Of which it minds us, all sad hearts to cheer,
And us from our collapsed state help rear.
For as Christ in a Joh. 18. 1. to 16. c. 19. 41, 42. c. 20. 1. to 17. Romans 4,
25. 1 Cor. 15. throughout. 2 Cor. 4. 14. Ephesians. 2. 10.
Garden was betrayed,
And dead, there in a new sepulcher laid,
So did he there from death rise up again,
And thereby raised up all his chosen train,
From their lost, lapsed, to a blessed state
Of grace and glory. O then celebrate,
And ever bless, praise, love, serve Christ, who thus
Has raised, redeemed, restored, exalted us:
And let each Garden put us still in mind
Of these three states belonging to mankind,
Without whose perfect knowledge, view, and sight,
We cannot know God, nor our selves aright.
20.
Each weed which we in gardens see to grow,
Our sinful state, and seeds of vice us show,
Both from Gen 3. 17, 18, 19.
man's fall in Eden first did spring,
And sighs, Genesis 3. 1, 2. 1 King. 11. 1, to 10. 2 Chronicles. 21. 1, to 12. 2 Timothy

We see the fattest Garden ground still breeds
The largest, rankest briars, Prove. 24. 31. Isa. 39. 13. Zeph. 2. 9. Hos. 9 6.

So greatest sins, crimes, vices usually,
In men of greatest parts, wit, dignity,
And in the richest persons, Natures grow,
Not in the vulgar meaner sort below.
The pregnant wits, best Natures void of grace,
Are greatest sins, crimes, vices common place.
O trust not then to Ephesians. 2. 1, 2, 3. c. 4. 17, 18, 19. Romans 1. 24. to 32. Job.

Which if true grace control not, are but fit

Which should still grow, and flourish in mankind,
In whom, alas, we them most rarely find.
What? shall our gardens, fruitful, useful be,
Stored with all good fruits, herbs, roots? and yet we
Be barren, fruitless, void of virtue, grace,
And naught but lust, vice, weeds in us have place?
O shame! O sin! let gardens teach us then,
Now to prove fertile, good and gracious men.

When as we see weeds Gardens overgrow,
Deface, kill herbs, flowers, fruits that in them blow,
Through mere neglect, and want of weeding; we

And so should teach us with all care to weed
Them out, as fast as they within us breed:
Which, if neglected will in short time gain
Such root, that they will in us still Joh. 8. 11. 2 Chro. 34. 15. 16. 17.

When we behold small Gardens fraught with store
Of rarest flowers, herbs, fruits, and yielding more
Of these than greatest Gardens, commonly
Made more for pleasure, than commodity:

Great, vastest, men of bulk, in gifts, wit, parts,
True valor, learning, wisdom, skill in Arts:

Those who in Gods Church, Saints, no such delight,
Or sweetness find, may judge, their states not right.

And as men thus Cant. 5. 1. c. 6. 2. 12. c. 8. 13.

In pleasant gardens, which they like full well:
So Cant. 8. 13. c. 6. 2. 2 Cor. 6. 16. 17. 18. Lev. 26. 12. Ephesians. 3. 17. Rev.
7. 15. c. 21. 3. c. 3. 20. Gal. 2. 20. 1 John 3. 24. c. 4. 16.
Christ within his Church, Saints, walks, resides,
Lives, dwells, and in no place on earth abides,
Delights or joys, so much as in them: where
He feeds, feasts, rests, and does his palace rear.
Sweet Jesus let my soul thy garden be,
That thou may still delight, walk, dwell in me.

No Genesis 2. 5, 6. 10. 11. Job. 8. 16. c. 14. 9. Isa. 1. 30. Jer. 14. 1. to 21.
Isa. 58. 11. Ps. 65. 10. 11. Hosea 14. 5, 6, 7.
Gardens spring, grow green, or fructify,
Unless the Sun shine on them from on high,
And clouds drop rain, dew on them to revive
Their withred fruits, and make them sprout, grow, thrive:
No Church or Saint can Isa. 27. 2, 3. Mal. 4. 2. Psalm. 80. 7. 19. Luc. 1. 78,

Unless the rays of Gods most blessed face,
And Christ's (the Son of righteousness) bright beams,
Shine on them: and their sweetest showers, dewes streams,
And influence from heaven on them drop,
To make them bear a rich and ample crop.
Lord let thy Church and chosen ever be
Blessed with these rays, showers, streams which flow from thee:
Then shall they Ps. 1. 3. Jer. 17. 8. Ps 92. 13, 14, 15.

And store of fruits of grace to thee forth bring.
13.
Gardens have in them all sorts of herbs, trees,
Flowers, roots, plants: So the Ephesians. 2. 10. 12, 13. 16. to 25. c. 3. 5. 6.
Gal. 3. 27, 28. Jam. 2. 1. to 10. Mat. 13. 47, 48.
Church has all degrees,
And ranks of men within her, high, and low,
Rich, poor, old, young, good, bad, here in her grow.
This Acts 10. 11. to 17. Mat. 13, 47, 48, 49.
Peter's sheet, Christ's net did typifie,
And is a truth apparent to each eye.
From hence the Church has gained the style and name
Of Psalm. 19. 11. Romans 10. 18. Matthew. 28. 19. Mar. 16. 15, 16.
Catholic, since all sorts in the same
Comprised are. Let no men then seclude
Themselves from her, who does all sorts include.
14.
As Genesis 2. 10. Number. 24. 6. Isa. 58. 11.

Rich, precious fruits, to water day by day,
Which else would fade, and wither quite away:
The living waters, springs, streams of Christ's blood,
Word, spirit, grace, prepared for their good;
Still by or in them glide, run, flow, and spring,
To make them sweet, green, pleasant fruits to bring
In more abundance. O Heb. 6. 8. Mat. 3. 10. c. 7. 19. Luc. 13. 6, 7, 8.

If under these we withered, barren be.
15.
When Psalm. 80. 13. Cant. 2. 15.
wild bores, beasts break into Gardens, they
Them root up, wast, deface, and much decay:
When Psalm. 80. 12, 13, 14, 15. 2 Chronicles. 34. 15. to 19. Acts 8. 1, 3, 4. c. 9.

Break in upon Gods Church, or Saints, they mine,
Root up, spoil, wast them, unless God assuage,
Restrain, divert, or quell their spiteful rage.
Lord always Ps. 125. 2, 3.
fence thy Church, Saints round about,
Against all foes, who seek to root them out;
And when thou shall permit them to break in,
Oh then, let them root naught out but their sin.

The places where their foes their blood did spill,
To their great grief and shame: who thought thereby
Quite to prevent and kill their progeny;
Which they mean while did only plant and sow,
And by that blood they shed made these to grow.
Yea, as some Garden plants, herbs often cropped
Spring up more thick: So Gods Church, Saints often lopt,
Cut down, cropped, (nay destroyed in carnal eyes
Conceit) by cruel Tyrants; sprout, arise,
And grow more thick, great; numerous thereby,
The Exodus 1. 12. Philemon. 10. Philip. 1 1. 14. 16, 17, 18. Acts 8. 1. to 16.

Witness the Eusebius. Theoderet. Nicephorus, Socrates, Evagrius, the Centuries,
the English, and French books of Martyrs.
Churches story in each age,
Which gained, increased, not lost by tyrants rage.
O let us then be willing thus to sow
Our blood, that thence new troops of Saints may grow,
To store Christ Church, mantaine his cause when we
Are turned to dust, consumed and cease to be.

to die,
In winter, when hid under earth they lie
Within their Roots or Seeds, yet spring again,
When winter ends, through Summers heat and rain,
And show that they were neither dead, killed, lost,
But only nipt and hid by winters frost;
Because they thus in summer spring, revive,
And show themselves to every eye alive:
Most sweetly, clearly to us demonstrate,
Gods chosen Saints and Churches winter-state,
Whose faith and saving graces Psalm. 51. 9, 10, 11, 12. Psalm. 42. 5, 6. Ps. 77.
1 to 11. Revel. 3. 2.
seem to die
In their temptations, and so buried lie
Within their seeds, roots, that they want the sense,
Fruits, comforts of them: and conclude from thence,
That they no doubt are quite dead, killed, spoiled, lost
And they undone, by their sharp winters frost.
But yet when these their boystrous storms are past,
And Summer comes, they Hosea 14. 5, 6. Mich. 7. 8, 9. Isa. 40. 29, 30, 31. Job
17. 9. Ps. 92. 12, 13, 14, 15. Luc. 22. 32 Rev. 2. 19.
re-appeare at last,
To their great comfort, and so sprout, grow, thrive
A fresh, that all see, they were still alive;
And only hid, benumbed for that space.
O then let all indu'd with saving grace
Learn hence their drooping souls to comfort, cheer,
In all temptations, cases, where they fear
A loss of graces: Lo, they 1 John 3. 9. Ps. 1. 3. Ps. 125. 1, 2. Romans 8. 35.

still remain
In safety in them, and shall spring again.
What though they cannot now them feel or eye;
Wait but a while, and they shall them discry.
It will not still be winter, Cant. 2. 11, 12, 13. Hos. 14. 5, 6. Isa. 60. 1.
Ephesians. 5. 14.
spring is near;
If not before, yet then they will appear,
In greater luster, vigor than before.
Lay up this blessed cordial then in store,
Against all evil days which will us cheer,
When as our graces hide, and disappeare.
18.
Hence may we likewise Popish sots refell,
Who hold Stapleron, Bellarmin* Bozius, Augustinus Triumphans, and others.
Gods Church on earth still visible,
In glorious sort, as if she always grew
In summer Islands, and no winter knew:
When as each true Church, Saint, whiles here below
Often feel, and find such winters, storms, frost, snow.
As quite eclipse, 1 Kings 19. 14, 15. 18. To. 11. 3. to 6. Mat. 26. 56. Acts

veil, hide them, and their grace,
Yea make them seem dead, livelesse for a space,
Both in their own and others sense; as I
By sundry stories might exemplyfie,
Did not each gardens winter quarter teach
This truth, and it unto our senses preach.
19.
Hence may each Church, St further learn to cheer;
Steel, arm themselves against all future fear
Of winter storms, blasts, trials which may shake
Their leaves, fruits, stalks down to the earth, and make
Them in appearance livelesse, void of grace,
And in a wretched, helpelesse, hopeless case,
Like Gardens in cold winters: But yet shall
This daunt their faith, or make their hope quite fall?
O no! this winter lasts but for a space,
And then succeeds a blessed spring of grace;
Which shall revive, refresh, repair, restore;
Yea much increase, what seemed dead, lost before,
As it did unto Job 42. 10, to 17.
Job, whose latter end
His first estate in bliss did far transcend:
O then, what ever be thy case, Mic. 7. 8, 9, 10. Ps. 27. 14. Ps. 37. 5, 6, 7,
34. 39. 40. Ps. 40. 1, 2, 3. Psalm. 113. 7, 8, 9.
rely,
Wait, rest on God with faith, hope, constancy,
Who far beyond thy thoughts will thee translate,
In his due season, to a blessed state:
He who makes each grass, plant, herb, grow and spring,
Will make his Church, Saints much more sprout, laugh, sing.
20.
Hence may all raging Persecutors see,
That their attempts against Christ's Church, Saints, be
Vain, bootlesse, senseless, Exodus 1. 10, 11, 12, etc. Act 8. 1, to 16.

The very end and scope of their intent,
Making them more to thrive, increase, and grow,
Instead of working their wished overthrow.

bliss out of our misery?
And makes the malice of our enemies,
The spring from whence our greatest Comforts rise?
O what besotted, senseless fools are those
Who Gods true Church, and chosen Saints oppose!
They think to crush, but raise them: they intend
To work their ruin, yet their states amend.
This Genesis 37. to 50.
Joseph's brethren, Esth 5. to 10.
Hammons enmity,

With others, whose attempts still overthrew
Themselves at last, but made Gods chosen crew.
21.
In winter season we can hardly know,
Dead Garden plants from living; since in show
They both seem dead and withered to the eye;
But when as Summer comes, we presently
Discern the dead from those that are alive,
Because the one Jude 12.
sprouts not, the other thrive:
Cant. 2. 11, 12, 13. Mat. 24. 32. Hosea 14. 5, 6, 7. Job 14. 7, 8, 9, 10.
Grow green, hear fruits; So when cold winters blast,
Benummes Gods childrens graces, or them cast
Into a swooning fit, or Lethargy,
Themselves or others hardly can descry
Them from dead Christians: but when means of Grace,
And summer once begin to come in place,
Both are with ease discerned, Isa. 66. 14. Mal. 4. 2. Joh. 15. 2. 7. 8.
Saints then spring,
Revive, and goodly fruits of grace forth bring:
And so their hidden life by Jam. 2. 17, 18. Mat. 5. 16. Rev. 2. 19.

The other spring not, or else fruitless are;
And so proclaim themselves Jude 12.
dead. Let all try
Their inward state of life, and grace hereby.
23.
When Isa. 5. 1. to 8.
Gardens fruitless be or overgrowne
With weeds or thorns, they are then open thrown,
Pulled up, laid wast: So when a Church with weeds
Is overrun, and naught but errors breeds,
Or gross corruptions, sins; Psalm. 80. 12, 13. Isa. 5. 1. to 8. 2 Chronicles. 34.
15. to 20. Rev. 2. 5. Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. c. 2. 3. c. 3. 11. to 17. Matthew.
3. 9. c. 7. 19.
God then does cast
Her walls, pales down, and forthwith lays her wast.
Thus does he deal with private Christians too,
Who by their barrennesses, sins, Lusts undo
Themselves, provoking God them off to cast,
Pull down their hedge, and lay them ever wast.
O let each Church and Christian then take heed
How they prove barren, or sins in them breed.
If Gods Bill of devorce be once out su'd,

Of weeds or poisonous Plants, corrupt the good;
Kill, blast, or harm them more or less: So ill

Of Saints and Churches vices often consume,
Out-smell the richest Odours of their Grace;
Which in Gods Nose, and Men's then find no place,
Whiles that the stinking savor of their weeds
Thus drownes their virtues sent, and it exceedes.
O then root out these nasty Plants, which sink
Our sweeter fumes, and turn them into stink.
25.
Sweet Garden Herbs, Flowers, Spices Bruised, intend
Their fragrant Odors, and their sents amend;
Whilst whole they Cant. 5. 13. Exodus 30. 34. 23. Isa. 42. 24. Jer. 6. 20.

Vile earthly, rotten, stinking, sinful hearts
And Natures (when he us to him converts;)
Wherein naught but sins, vices, lusts did spring
Before; and no one grace, nor one good thing:
O let none then despair of having grace
Because his nature, heart are sinful, base,
Corrupt and loathsome; since God makes stinking.
Vile Earth, dung, sweet, fair, goodly flowers forth-bring.

Are turned to dung, 1 Cor. 15. 1 These. 4. 14. 16. Job 19. 25. 26. 27.

The Epilogue.
O That all Christians by this Posie, I
Have here collected would learn instantly
When as they in their pleasant Gardens walk,
Thus with their own Psalm. 4. 4.
Hearts, God and Christ to talk
By pious Meditations, from what they
Behold within their Gardens day by day.
How sweet then would their walks and Orchards prove?
How would their Souls be fired with Gods Love?
Each Garden then would be a Paradise,
A second Eden to the godly-wise:
Is It not a Sinful, Shameful, beastly thing
For Christians to toil, walk, talk, laugh, feast, sing,
Play, sport themselves, or meditate only
Of worldly things, in Gardens constantly;
And in the mean time scarce to have one sweet;
Or pious thought from objects they there meet,
Of God, Christ, Heaven, Man's Mortality,
Presented to them in each Herb they Eye?
For shame then let us all this fault amend
Hereafter, and our Hearts, Minds, fully bend
To godly Meditations, whiles we pass
Our time in Gardens, where each flower, herb, grass
And Creature we behold, will soon suggest
Some useful Thoughts to every pious Breast,
It to amend, and with sweet Ecstasies
To elevate above the starry skies.
If any want help in this kind, they may
Till better come, make use of this Essay.

Days, Nights, and Years are spent
In Eating, Drinking, Feasting, Complement,
Vain Chat, Sports, Visits, Pleasures of each kind,
The flesh to pamper? whereas I scarce find
Admist all these diversions, one days space,
Or hour to fast, pray, weep, read, sue for grace.
How many daily the whole morning pass,
And vainly spend, between the Comb and Glass,
In combing, frizling, powdring of their hair,
And wanton locks, to make them seem more fair?
No Lock, or hair must out of order stand,
But sit in Print, and often be viewed, curled, scand.
Nay, which is strange, more cost, time, now is spent
Upon false Bushes of bought excrement,
(Which some prefer before their native fleece,)
Than upon me, man's honor, Masterpiece;
When this is done, the Back, Neck, Feet, Hands, Face,
And other parts must have their several space
For to adorn them, so as half che day
Is spent well nigh, the body to array:
And that but until n^ght, when all this pride,
Attire is quite stripped off, and laid aside,
As if it never were. O fools to waste
Time in these toys, which not one days space last!
Yet I neglected soul, whom to adorn
And daily deck with grace mankind was borne,
Untrimmed lie, no cost, time, pains are spent
In decking me, man's only ornament.
Gods word (the Jam. 1. 23. 24, 25.
Glass, which daily should descry
My spots, stains, filth, and gross deformity,
Them to redress, and help men to array

For these good ends, and if that any do
Behold it now and then for custom sake,
The 1 Pet. 3. 3, 4, 5. 1 Timothy 2. 9, 10.
Rule to dress them by they will not it make.
And though my sacred beauty, robes, array,
Do never fade, wax old, but last foc aye:
Yea add more luster to my Baser part,
The Flesh, then either nature or man's art
Are able; causing it to Dan 13. 3. Matthew. 13. 43.
shine with rays
Of brightest glory, which shall last always:
Yet few or none spend half the time to dress,
Adorn Me, which they wast with greediness
Upon their bodies, faces, heads, locks, back,
Themselves and Me, without Gods grace, to wrack.
This being now my rufull state; O let
Me here beseech all who have souls, to set
Some tine apart to Ponder my complaint
Thus tendered to them, under which I faint.
And that you may just Judges twixt us prove,
Hear but a word or two, as you me love.
What is the body, but a loathsome Mass

Which sickness, Crosses, Age still cause to fade.
What are our locks, our curled brayds of hair,
But excrements at best? not half so fair,
As plumes of sundry birds or peacocks tails,
Though frizled, poudred, decked with pearls, knots, vailes.
And yet how many more proud, careful are
Of these vain bushes, than their souls welfare?
How many purchase heads of others hair,
To mend Gods work, and make them seem more fair?
Spending more time, cost, thoughts on excrement,
Than upon Me man's only ornament.
What is the belly but a filthy sink,
Jakes which engenders naught but dung and stink?
So noisome, that its sent offends the smell,
Corrupts the air, even when the body's well.
What are the other members (head, hands, feet)
But skin and bones? without my help unmeete
For any use, yea let me once withdraw
My self from the most fair corpse, eyes ere saw,

Is turned, and all abhor it is loathsomenesse.
What has the flesh or body worthy love,
Or praise, but that which from me first does move?
Let me desert them, all their worth is lost,
And withered like grass nipt with winters frost.
Why should you then, (O fools, bereft of sense)
From day to day, bestow so much expense,
Time, pains, thoughts, Care on these things which so base,
Mean, fading are, neglecting Me and grace?
In which your chiefest good, yea, all your bliss
Comprised are. If you judge not amiss.
If this prevail not, but you still proceed
Me to neglect, the flesh to deck, serve, feed;
Tell Me, I pray you, when the dismal day
Of sickness, death, or judgment, take away,
And cite you to account, how you have spent
Your golden days, for my use to you lent,
What joy or comfort can you reap from all,
Or any of those days, hours, which you shall
Have thus misspent on belly, back, head, face,
Hair, feasting, pastimes, pleasures void of grace;
Or in the flesh or bodies servitude?
Which then will too too late be of you ru'd.
Shall ye not then with sighs and tears lament,
(And that in vain) the time you thus misspent;
Offering to give ten thousand worlds, that you
Had not bereft Me, of the time, care, due
To Me alone, to fit Me for that place,
Of endless bliss, which I for want of grace,
Shall then be thrust from, and cast into hell,

Will not you then wish, you had never seen
This flesh, this body, which to me have been
So traitrous, so unkind, Me to enthrall
Unto their lusts, and spur Me into All
That might undo, damn, both them Me, and you,
And we shall in hels flames for ever rue?
If this be true: O then whiles life, time, space,
Are left you to repent and seek for grace;
Bewail what is past, and henceforth learn to be
More loyal, kind, respectfull unto Me.
Save Me, save all; lose Me, and all is lost,
For ever with Me; spend then all your cost,
Thoughts, pains, cares, days, on Me; then shall you Dan. 12. 3. Matthew. 13.

shine,
More bright than Stars, Moon, Sun, with rays divine
In Christ's own kingdom, where you shall possess
Such endless joys, as no tongue can express.
If this will not persuade you to amend,
I Will cease my Plaint, and here in silence end.

COMFORTABLE CORDIALS, AGAINST DISCOMFORTABLE Fears of Imprisonment, and other
sufferings in good causes. Containing some Latin Verses, Sentences, and Texts
of Scripture, written by Mr. WILLIAM PRYNNE on his Chamber walls in the Tower
of London, during his Imprisonment there; since Translated by him into English
VERSE.

2 CORINTHIANS 1, 2, 3 4 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Blessed be God, even the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;
who comfort us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them
which are in any troubles by the comfort wherewith we our selves are comforted
of God. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also
abounds by Christ. And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation,
and salvation which is effectual in enduring of the same sufferings, which we
also suffered: or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and
salvation. And our hope of you is steadfast; knowing that as you are partakers
of the sufferings, so also you shall be of the consolation. For we would not,
Brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we
were pressed out of measure above strength, in so much that we despaired even
of life. But we had the sentence of death in our selves that we should not
trust in our selves but in God which raises the dead: who delivered us from so
great a death and does deliver, in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us:
you also helping together by Prayer for us that for the gift bestowed upon us,
by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.

Christus ubique pium comitatur; Carceris Antrum
Ingreditur: Turres, Densissima Maenia, Rupes,
Fossas, Ferratas Portas, Obstacula, Flammas
Permeat intrepidus; socius solamen, Amicus,
Omnia seclusis, oan. 20. 19.
solus; saturatque benignus
Deliciis superum sitientia Corda suorum,
Discipulis foribus clusis intravit amaenus,
Christicolis clausis habit at conviva perennis.
O fortunatus, cui Con-captivus Jesus,
Laetificans radiis tristissima Claustra supernis;
Vincula non illum, Tormenta, gravamina moestum
Efficient, animum retinentem utcunque serenum.
Christ every where accompanies good Men;
He goes with them into the Prisons Den;
The Towers, thickest Walls broad ditches, Gates,
Of Iron, Barracadoes, Flames and Grates
Does boldly pass through; proves Companion,
Friend, solace, all things of himself alone;
Unto close Prisoners and fills plenteously
The thirsty souls of his, with heavenly
Delights. John 20: 19.
He entered in the doors fast shut
To his Disciples, them to comfort; but
With godly prisoners he is a constant guess
Resides; O happy he who does possess
Christ for his Fellow-prisoner, who does glad
With heavenly Sunbeames, Goales that are most sad,
Bonds, Torments, Prisons, make not him sad; he
Retains a quiet mind how ere things be.
4.
Nullatenus vinctus Christi virtute solutus;
Permanet immunis, clusus vel Carcere Vinclis.
Liber ubique, pius, placidus, benedictus, amoenus,
Indomitus; tacitum circumfert pectore Coelum:
Tristia Laetificans, Moestissima cuucta serenans;
Vincula discutiens, arctissima claustra recludens.
He is not bound whom CHRIST has made free; he
Though shut close Prisoner, chaind, remains still free,
A godly Man's at large in every place,
Still cheerful, well content, in blessed case,
Unconquered; he a secret Heaven still bears
About within his breast, which sad things cheares,
Dispells his blackest clouds of grief, off shakes
His chains; and closest prisons open makes.
5.
Vincula non Animam cohibent, haud carcere clusam:
Sidera transvolitat, Terram, Mare, cuncta pererrat
Alipes, immensi fines transcendit Olympi;
Limitis impatiens, arctari nescia Mundi
Cancellis; tantum requiescens Numine vasto;
Securus, placidusque Piis, vel turbine, Portus;
No bands the soul of Man can once restrain;
No Prison it enclose, nor yet contain;
It soars above the Stars, and swiftly flies
Over Earth, Sea, all things; mounts beyond the skies,
And bounds of the vast Heavens, impatient
Of Limits, ignorant how to be pent
Within the Rayles of this whole world; only
Resting within the boundless Deity;
A secure, pleasant harbor to Godly
Men, even in a storm of Misery.

Suffering's their* Alpha who to Heaven tend;
But Joy is their Omega, final end;
Their Entrance is adorned with tears of Woe,
Their end with Triumphs, which their griefs outgo.

Nil Crus sentit in Nervo, si Anima sit in Coel^.
The Leg feels nothing in the stocks, if the
Soul, mind, Affections in Heaven placed be.
10.
Non timet is carcerem, qui scit contemnere Libertatem,
Vitam, voluptatem, Famam: cui Mundus Ergastulum,
Terra Exilium, Deus habitaculum, Mors Solatium.
He fears no prison who knows to despise
Freedom, Life, pleasure, Fame, which others prise:
To whom this world's a prison; Earth, a place
Of Exile, God, a Mansion; Death, Solace.
11.
Servus Christi etiam in vinculis, Liber.
Servus Peccati etiam in summa Liberate captivus.
Christ's Servants even in prison are still free:
Sins, in the greatest freedom, captives be.
12.
Nil corpus patitur in Ergastulo, si Animus sit in Coelo.
The body suffers naught in prison, when
The mind it self is lodged in Heaven.
13.
Quid Coelum sine Deo, nisi Barathrum?
Quid Barathum eum Deo nisi Coelum?
What Is Heaven without God but a very Hell?
What Is Hell but a Heaven, if God once there dwell?
14.
Nullibi incarceratur, qui ubique in Christo liberatur:
Nunquam dejicitur, qui semper a Jehova sustentatur.
He in no place can once imprisoned be,
Who in all places is Joh. 8. 36. Gal. 5. 1.
by Christ set free:
He never is Psalm. 37. 24.
dejected, who always
Has great Jehovah for his prop and stay.
15.
Nusquam solus qui ubique cum Deo;
Nunquam Miser quisemper cum Christo,
He never is alone, who every where
Has God himself, him company to bear,
He never can be miserable, who
Is always with Christ, who does with him go.
16.
Vbi Deus adest, ibi non est Carcer, sed Paradisus; Non Ergastulum,
Sed Palatium; non Barathrum, sed Coelum.
Where God is present, there no Prison is,
But a sweet Paradise of Joy and bliss;
No Bridewell, but a Palace; no dark Cell,
But a bright Heaven, where all comforts dwell.
17.
Carcer probat Ami^es, detegit Iuimicos;
Excludit Mundum, includit Deum:
Alit virtutes, extinguit Libidines,
Edocet Temperantiam; cohibet Luxuriam;
Mortificat earnem, sanctificat hominem;
Ingenerat gratiam, the saurizat Gloriam.
A prison tries* Men's friends, detects their Foes,
Shuts out the world, God to men does enclose;
Nourishes virtues, Lusts extinguisheth;
Temperance teaches, Riot restrains,
Quite kills the flesh, but makes the Man holy;
Ingenders Grace, 2 Cor. 4. 17. 2 Timothy 4. 8.
and ire asures up glory.

The Tower true faithful Christians feinedly
Imprisons, but them sets free verily,
By putting on them Christ's sweet yoke only,
To which to be subjected, is truly
To be enfranchised; by shaking off
The manifold, and most heavy chains of
The flesh, sin, World, Di'le; in which for to lie
Insnarde, is to be captived certainly.

The Tower is to most, a Spectacle;

To guiltless ones, it is an Inn; to guilty
A Bridewell; to learned ones, it is a study;
To idle ones a Dormitory; to
Drunkards, a tipling-house them to undo;
To Traitors it is a shambles, where their head
And Quarters hang, when they are butchered.

arctari non potest, qui ipsa Dei infinitate (incarceratus) spatiatur. Ita
ominatur Gulielmus Prynne: Martij 3. 1633.

God is a Tower by protecting all
His Saints from Ills, in Ills which them befall;
Against, amidst ill men in every place,
Most safely, strongly out of his mere grace;
By comforting them in adversity
Always, most sweetly, most abundantly:
By freeing them from evils speedily,
In the best time, and that most potently:
No doubt he is the happiest man alive,
Who this worlds Exile, and Christ's dear Captive,
Is during life adjudg'd perpetually
In this most safe, sweet, best great'st Tower to lie.
He is truly kept safely, who both by
And in God is preserved continually:
He cannot straightened be, who walks freely
(Whiles prisoner) in Gods vast Infinity.
Of this opinion WILLIAM PRYNNE was the
Third day of March, six hundred thirty three.
Sentences of Scriptures there likewise written.
PSALM. 69. 33.
The Lord hears the poor, and despises not his prisoners.

PSALM. 146. 7, 8.
The Lord loses the prisoners; the Lord raises those that are bowed down.

PHIL. 4. 11, 12, 13.
I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content, I know both
how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where, and in all things I am
instructed, both to be full, and to be hungry; both to abound, and to suffer
need: I can do all things through Christ, which strengtheth me.

PSALM. 34. 17. 19. 22.
The righteous cry, and the Lord hears, and delivers them out of all their
troubles. Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers
him out of them all; the Lord redeemeth the soul of his Servants, and none of
them that trust in him, shall be desolate.

PSALM. 37. 23, 24, 37, 38, 39, 40.
The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and he delights in his
way: Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, for the Lord
upholdeth him with his hand: Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: For
the end of that man is peace. But the transgressors shall be destroyed
together, the end of the wicked shall be cut off: But the salvation of the
righteous is of the Lord, he is their strength in the time of trouble. And the
Lord shall help them and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked,
and save them, because they trust in him.

PSALM. 71. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.
Thy righteousness also O God, is very high, who have done great things, O God
who is like to thee? Thou which have showed me great and sore troubles, shall
quicken me again, and shall bring me up again from the depthes of the
earth. Thou shall increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side. I will
also praise thee, with the Psaltery even thy truth: O my God unto thee will I
sing with the Harp, O thou holy one of Israel: My lips shall greatly rejoice
when I sing unto thee: and my soul which thou have redeemed: my tongue also
shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded,
for they are brought unto shame that seek my hurt.

MICAH: 7, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
A man's enemies are the men of his own house: Therefore I will look unto the
Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation, my God will hear me: Rejoice
not against me o mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise: when I sit in
darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me. I will bear the indignation of
the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause and
execute judgment for me, He will bring me forth to the light, and I shall
behold his righteousness. Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame
shall cover her which said unto me, where is the Lord thy God? mine eyes shall
behold her, now shall she be trodden down, as the mire of the streets.

On his Sufferings on the Pillory.

Alacrity, joy, promptitude: And shall
I not for his sake then most cheerfully

But Phil. 1. 29 2 Timothy 2. 12. Rev. 7. 13. to 17.

Verses made by W. PRYNNE, as he returned by Water to the Tower after his last
sufferings, upon his Stigmatizing.
S. L. Stigmata Laudis.
Stigmata Maxillis referens, Insignia Laudis,
Exultans remeo, victima grata Deo.
Bearing Lands Stamps on my Cheeks, I retire
Triumphing, Gods sweet Sacrifice through fire.
On his return from Exile.
Foes sent me hence, but God, and his Saints cries
Have brought me back, it is wondrous in all Eyes.
No Exiles, Prisons, Chains, powers can detain
Those whom God will recall, free, raise again.
ISAY. 51. 11. 14. c. 41. 5, 6.
The redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion, and
everlasting joy shall be upon their head; they shall obtain gladness and joy;
and sorrow and mourning shall flee away. The CAPTIVE EXILE hastneth, that he
may be loosed, and that he should not dye in the pit, nor that his bread should
fail. Fear not, for I am with thee, I will bring thy seed from the East, and
gather thee from the West, I will say to* the North, Give up; and to the South,
keep not back; bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of
the Earth.
