Lecturis valere and gaudere.
Postquam mihi curandae ANATOMIAE publicae demandata fuit provincia, illud
Sedulo operam dedi ut mea cura tam ad cives nostros, quam hospites, quibus
famae Leydensis innotuit Anatomiae, redundaret utilitas. Variis haec and
huculentis Clarissimorum virorum instructa Donariis, quaeque temporis invidia,
and Longa Oblivione obruta jacebant, in sinu Scivat reclusa. Quicquid videt cum
maxim oriens and Occidens: Omne missa in compendium via Ostentat, and ne
confusa CHAOS intentionis aciem vestrae abrumperet, ita in hoc Catalogo
discripsi, and disposui omnia, ut nullo opere quaerentibus occurant Spectanda.

VALE LECTOR, and fruere.

Omne malum finis pulcra coronat opus

Aviena, qui Batavas spectatum veneris oras;
Huc age, quae stupeas inclyta Leyda dabit;
Huc Ubi Legiferam Cererem comitatur Osiris,
Isidos Argolicae suspice signa deae:
Frustra Deum, fragilis Fortunae idola profana,
Urnam quae cineres relligiosa notet:
Lampada, ad humanos quae non pervenerit usus,
Cui magis in cultu, cui magis apta Deum!
Vixerit, aeternae tantum se pasta Lucernae
Flammula, an invisae Larva fit illa rei?
Qua Lacerarit acu, qualem cui Fibula vestem
Vixerit, unde sagum strinxerit, unde togatu:
Divitis Egypti pretioso cadavera, Lata
Finibus Eois, invidiosa Diis:
Singula nosse juvet, tamen his, and inania rerum,
Et maris, and terrae viscera posthabeas;
Erudit incantum te vox facunda CRAMERI,
Et claram ambiguo praestat ubique facem:
Sic saecli penetrare Sinus, and Viscera very,
Sic poteris Roma prodigiore frui.
