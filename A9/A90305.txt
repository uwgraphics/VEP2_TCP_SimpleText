Master Recorder of Oxford his Speech to His Majesty.
MAy it please your sacred Majesty,
I was requested by Master Mayor, in the name, and in the behalf of himself,
his Brethren the Aldermen, and the whole body of this City to give Your Majesty
a true and just account of his proceedings concerning your late Propositions
for the bringing in Money, Plate, and Horses, for your royal assistance in
these your present wars: wherein if he have not in so full a measure answered
your gracious expectation as he desired he might, he hopes your Majesty will
accept the intention for the act, and please to pardon that fault, which
arises not from any want of good will in the people of this City to serve your
Majesty in all your affairs, but from their misfortune. First then, this City
in all humility and gratitude acknowledges the many and abundant favors
conferred on it by your royal bounty, the great comfort and security they have
and do receive by enjoying the beams of your sacred presence so long time among
them, the many privileges and franchises bestowed upon them and the University
from your gracious donation, and do confidently believe no one City in all
your Highness dominions can be more endeared and engaged to your Majesty's
cause and service, then this City of Oxford; because by the fruition of your
royal presence, they have ocular testimony of your Majesty's virtues, and the
integrity of your good meaning toward your subjects, which other Cities can
only have by hearsay. Master Mayor and his brethren the Aldermen, intimating
your late urgent occasions to the inhabitants of this City for some supplies of
money, have (if it please your Majesty) found the intentions of the people so
prone to your royal pleasure, as no men in the world could express a greater
and more ready desire and zeal to lay down their lives and fortunes at their
Sovereigns feet then they: they protest they are so confident of your
Majesty's goodness, and stand so well affected to your cause, that not a man
of them who is able to bear arms, but would willingly go into the field in
your quarrel. And for Plate, Money, and Horses, every man according to his
ability will readily contribute. But (with your royal pardon) that can amount
to no considerable sum, nor worthy your Majesty's acceptance, by reason of
the infinite detriments and impoverishments which have fallen on the
inhabitants of this City in these wars: the Scholars (from whose custom they
acquired most part of their profits) either being non-residents in the
University, by reason of these calamitous and perilous times; and if they be,
they are either disfurnished of moneys, by want of supplies from their friends,
or by default of their Tenants (such as have any) not paying them their rents;
so that Tradesmen are feign to vend all their wares on trust, or keep them in
their hands: a man that is reckoned worth two or three thousand pounds (which
is a very considerable estate in this City) being not able (though it were to
save his life) to produce an hundred pound in ready money; they who are great
money-masters keeping it in their hands, from whose gripes it is not to be
ravished, neither upon the best security by bond that is in the Town, neither
upon the morgage or sale of Lands: Besides, the country, which was wont to
take off many commodities from this City, have now quite deserted it, there
being no commerce between us and them, either because they have no money at
all, being deprived of it by the rapine of the soldiers, or else because they
dare not come hither with their money, for fear it should be taken away from
them by the said soldiers; and so for want of trade our Tradesmen are worn
quite out of money: and for Plate, it abounds not here as it does in that
rich and mighty City of London, yet every man, according to the quantity he
has, will willingly impart it to the advancement of your Graces service; in
the interim, being grieved extremely that their abilities are inferior to
their desires, they have among them made a collection of three hundred pounds,
which is all that the meannesse of their fortunes can possibly stretch to at
this instant. This, Master Mayor and his brethren the Aldermen, in the name and
behalf of the whole City, most humbly beseech Your Majesty to accept as
graciously as they tender it with willingness of mind; and both the Mayor,
and the rest of the able Citizens, will as soon as possible take order for
Horses, and other provisions to serve Your Majesty withal, if these wars
continue: which they hope, and humbly desire, that Your Majesty's goodness
will endeavor to conclude and compose, that Your whole Kingdom may again
flourish in unity, peace, and concord.

The high Sheriff of Oxfordshire his speech to His Majesty.
MAy it please Your gracious Majesty,
according to Your late royal command, and my bounden duty, I am come to
render an account to Your Highness of the business You were pleased to employ
me in, and diverse of the Justices of Peace for this County. And surely, to
delude Your Majesty, or mince the intentions of diverse of the people of these
Counties, Oxford and Berk-shire, were little less then a capital crime in me:
I shall therefore plainly and briefly deliver how I find the people affected
toward Your Majesty's late Propositions, for Money, Plate, or Horses.

The greater part of these Counties consists (so please Your Majesty) of much
tillage and husbandry; and in that, and in grazing, all the wealth and
substance of it: and for the Husbandmen and Yeomanrie, they cry out that they
are quite undone and ruined, by the dreadful continuation of these wars; that
the soldiers have driven away or killed their Cattle, which should have
yielded them money; nay, risled them of that money which they had, so that they
are readier to ask relief to maintain themselves and their families, then
depart with any more of their estates; that they are bound to curse for ever
these wars, and with many deprecations wish, that Your Majesty would please to
hearken to Your Parliament, whom they know to be a company of wise, faithful,
and honorable men, such as will do nothing contrary to the fundamental Laws
of the Kingdom, in disfavour or derogation of Your Majesty's royal
Prerogative; that it cannot be but Your Majesty must needs be misinformed by
Malignants against Your Parliament, who have gone on in fair and legal ways
for the security of the subjects liberty. And with many more discourses of this
nature they humbly request Your Majesty would pardon their urgent necessity,
which compels them to many hard shifts for money for their own sustenance, and
not take it in ill part that they send not that which they have not. These are
the modester sort of them. But the common voice of the multitude is, that if
they had never so much money, they would not part with a penny of it to the
maintenance of these wars, which they say are made against themselves and their
liberties, against the Commonwealth and Parliament, which is the peoples prop,
and upholder of their liberties and privileges; and so they entreat Your
Majesty that You would think of some mean for peace, and then Your subjects
should no longer be oppressed with the charge of these wars. These are the
votes of the Plebeians, who either cannot or will not part with a penny toward
the maintenance of Your Highness wars. For the Gentry of these Counties, most
of them are of a more candid disposition, and better affected toward Your
Majesty, and the importunity of Your affairs proffering their lives and
estates at Your Highness service, esteeming themselves much honored that Your
Majesty would please to retain so good an opinion of them, as to put their
duties and zeals to serve you to the test; that they are much grieved at the
distractions of the Kingdom, which they wish were to be rectified without
further bloodshed; but that if there be no hopes of peace, they will live and
die (as befits their allegiance) in Your Highness quarrel: They also are very
sorry that the iniquity of the times has so straightened them for money, that
they cannot so amply demonstrate their readiness to serve you in their
actions, as they do in their wishes; that if they could possibly get any
indifferent price for their lands, they would sell them to furnish Your
Majesty's occasions, according to the integrity of their hearts. And so
amongst them (I mean that part of the Gentry of these Counties as stand
affected to Your Majesty) I have collected in Money and Plate two thousand and
odd pounds; a sum (I confess) I am ashamed to present to Your royal
acceptance: but it is all I could by my best industry and importunity procure
at this time. There are diverse Gentlemen that have subscribed for the finding
of Horses for Your Graces service, but as yet for want of money they cannot
bring them in, but will do with the first opportunity.

Thus I have (according to the reality of my duty) given Your Royal Majesty
a true account of my proceedings and of the affections of the people of these
Counties, which (in my conjecture) are concurrent with the intentions of all,
or most of the Comminalty of England, who by tradition from their Ancestors pay
that confidence to the Parliament, that they cannot be removed from it: between
whom and Your Sacred self I wish there were a sudden and fair end; for till
then Your People will never be satisfied, nor Your Kingdom happy.

Finis.
